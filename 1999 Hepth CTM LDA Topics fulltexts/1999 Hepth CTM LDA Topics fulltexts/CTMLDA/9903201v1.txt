abstract

we construct the most general solution in type-ii string theory that represents n co-
incident non-extremal rotating ns5-branes and determine the relevant thermodynamic
quantities. we show that in the eld theory limit, it has an exact description.
in
particular, it can be obtained by an o(3, 3) duality transformation on the exact string
background for the coset model sl(2, ir)n /u(1)  su(2)n . in the extreme supersym-
metric limit we recover the multicenter solution, with a ring singularity structure, that
has been discussed recently.

1 introduction

based on the d-dimensional kerr solution [1] and its generalization to a family of rotating,
electrically charged black holes in [2], a number of solutions with maximum number of
rotational parameters in 11- and 10-dim supergravities were constructed. among them
in particular, the most general solutions representing n coincident rotating m2- or m5-
or d3-branes [3]-[6]. however, an analogous solution representing n coincident rotating
ns5-branes has not been explicitly constructed. it is the purpose of this note to ll this
gap. it turns out that, because of the absence of rr elds, in the near-horizon limit
there is a description in terms of a background corresponding to the exact conformal eld
theory (cft) sl(2, ir)n /u(1)  su(2)n . this generalizes previous realizations that
such exact string backgrounds exist in the near-horizon limit of n coincident extremal [7]-
[9] and non-extremal [10] ns5-branes, as well as for n extremal ns5-branes distributed
uniformly along the circumference of a ring [11].

2 rotating ns5-branes

the usual ns5-brane solution (extremal or not; see, for instance, [12]) with no angular
parameters has a global so(4) symmetry. introducing angular momentum breaks this
symmetry to the cartan subalgebra of so(4), which is u(1)  u(1). since the latter is
two-dimensional we may obtain a solution with at most two angular parameters l1 and
l2. as we shall see, without loss of generality, these can be taken to be non-negative.
in order to obtain our solution we have used as a guide the general rotating m5-brane
solution [3, 4].1 the metric of our solution is given by

1it turns out that (1)(3) correspond to a dimensional reduction of the m5-brane solution we men-
tioned, along a vanishing circle corresponding to one of the angular variables, after we also replace the
mass parameter as m  mr. in particular, this empirical rule can be used in eq. (2.1) of [4] and eq.
(14) of [3] for the metric and 3-form respectively. the angular variable we mentioned is denoted by 
(in both papers) and we dimensionally reduce around  = /2.

transformation on (1)(3) and will not be presented here.

3the angular velocities i, i = 1, 2 in (5) below, are determined by demanding that the three-vector
(with components in the t, 1 and 2 directions) a = (1, 1, 2) be null at the horizon, i.e. 2|rh = 0.

finally we note that the thermodynamic quantities in (5) obey the rst law of black-hole
thermodynamics

dmadm = thds + 1dj1 + 2dj2 .

(8)

this is easily checked by treating madm , s, j1, j2 as functions of the variables m, l1, l2
using (5)(7).

3 the extremal limit

the extremal limit of the above solution is obtained by letting m  0. then, after
changing variables from (r, , 1, 2) to (x1, x2, x3, x4) as

x2! = qr2 + l2
  x1

1 sin   cos 1

sin 1 ! ,

we nd the following background

where h is given by

.

(11)

it can easily be checked that h is a (multicenter) harmonic function in the 4-dim eu-
clidean space spanned by the xis. the metric in (11) has singularities at

x3 = x4 = 0 ,

x1 = x2 = 0 ,

(12)

hence, the singularity structure is that of a ring with radius q|l2

in fact, (10)
with (11) corresponds to a continuous uniform distribution of ns5-branes along the
circumference of a ring [11].4

4my interest in nding the rotating ns5-brane solution (1)(3) was sparked by the (correct) remark
of e. kiritsis that the bps solution (10), could be unstable at nite temperature, since the gravitational
attraction will no longer be balanced by just the rr repulsion.
in our solution (1)(3) spin forces
provide the necessary extra balance.

harmonic function in (11) is eectively removed. then,
it becomes an exact string
background as it is connected by a t-duality transformation to the coset model cft
sl(2, ir)n /u(1)  su(2)n /u(1) [11].

the background (10) is an axionic instanton and as such it preserves half of the
supersymmetries of at space. from a gauge theory view point, it corresponds to a
higgs phase of a 6-dim sym theory su(n) broken to u(1)n since the centers where the
branes are put correspond to non-zero expectation values for the scalars. in our case the
vacuum moduli space has a zn  u(1) symmetry, which, in the continuous limit we are
discussing here, becomes a u(1)u(1) symmetry. this degeneracy is however lifted once
we turn on the temperature, and the corresponding supergravity solution can describe
excitations around these points of the moduli space.

4 field-theory limit and exact description

a natural question arises, namely what the eld-theory limit of the non-supersymmetric
background (1)(3) is and, moreover if it also has an exact cft interpretation as well.
consider the limit gs  0 and m  0 in such a way that the ratio m1/2/gs is held xed.
in this limit the yangmills coupling constant gym   remains nite. it is convenient
to dene rescaled quantities as

2m

=  ,

r = (2m)1/2 ,

li = (2m)1/2ai ,

i = 1, 2 ,

(13)

and then take the linit m  0 in (1)(3). we nd for the metric5

note that string-theory corrections to the supergravity result are organized in powers of
1/n. hence, by choosing n  1 we suppress these perturbative corrections. on the
other hand, string-loop corrections are suppressed by choosing n  . these are the
same conditions as were found in [10] for the case of zero angular momenta. as a nal
remark we note that it is very likely that the background (14)(16) can also be obtained
by gauging directly a 2-dim subgroup, isomorphic to u(1) u(1), of the wzw model for
sl(2, ir)  su(2). in that case we may compute the 1
n -corrections to the background
(14)(16) using techniques developed in [13]

4.1 the o(3, 3) duality transformation

first, consider the case of vanishing angular parameters a1 and a2. then, the background
(14)-(16) becomes the one corresponding to the sl(2, r)n /so(1, 1)  su(2)n exact
cft, as it was shown in [10]. it turns out that by performing an o(3, 3) transformation
to the latter background we can obtain the more general one given by (14)-(16). let
in order to
us rst pass to the euclidean regime by letting t  i and a1  ia1.
nd out the specic o(3, 3) matrix, we rst expand the -model action with metric
and antisymmetric tensor given by (14) and (15) for small values of a1, a2. then, the
innitesimal change in the -model lagrangian density is

l = 



a1  a2
cosh2 r
a1 + a2
cosh2 r

(sin2 + 1  cos2 + 2)
(sin2 +1 + + cos2 +2 ) + o(a2) ,

(18)

where we have changed variables as  = cosh r so that grr = 1 to zeroth order in a1, a2.
in the space of the three variables x  = (, 1, 2) a general o(3, 3) transformation acts
as (see for instance [14])

e = (ae + b)(ce + d)1 ,

(19)

where the group element g =   a b

d!  o(3, 3) preserves the bilinear form j =

an innitesimal version of the transformation (19) is obtained by expanding the o(3, 3)
group element around the identity element using a = i +a, b = b, c = c and d = iat ,
where b and c are antisymmetric matrices. then, the innitesimal change (rst order
in the generators a, b and c) of the -model lagrangian density is

l = (ae + eat + b  ece)+x x .
