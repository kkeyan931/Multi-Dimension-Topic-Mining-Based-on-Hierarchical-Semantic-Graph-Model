abstract

the dynamical content of local ads supergravity in ve dimensions is dis-

cussed. the bosonic sector of the theory contains the vielbein (ea), the spin

connection (ab) and internal su (n ) and u (1) gauge elds. the fermionic

elds are complex dirac spinors (i) in a vector representation of su (n ). all

elds together form a connection 1-form in the superalgebra su (2, 2|n ). for

n = 4, the symplectic matrix has maximal rank in a locally ads background

in which the dynamical degrees of freedom can be identied. the resulting

efective theory have dierent numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of

freedom.

over twenty years ago, cremmer, julia and scherk presented a beautiful n = 1 theory of

supergravity in 11 dimensions [1], which, apart from the metric and a gravitino (), included

a three-form eld (a). this theory is quite unique: a larger d or n would give rise to

inconsistencies upon compactication to 4 dimensions (i.e., elds with spin greater that 2

talk given at the second meeting on trends in theoretical physics, buenos aires, november

30-december 4, 1998.

1

or more than one graviton). a dual alternative possibility which uses a six form (a1...6)

instead of the three form also leads to inconsistencies [2]. additionally, it has been also

shown that regardless of the compactication arguments, the theory cannot accommodate

a cosmological constant in eleven dimensions [3].

one of the puzzling aspects of the theory is the conjecture contained in the original paper

by cremmer, julia and scherk in the sense that this theory should be related to another one

based on the osp(32|1) algebra, a problem that they promised to discuss in a forthcoming

article that never appeared. in fact, it can be seen that in a gauge theory for an osp(32|1)

connection, the anticommutator of the fermionic generators takes the form [4]

{q, q}  paa + zabab + zabcdeabcde,

where one could identify the dierent components of the connection that accompany the

generators in the rhs with the elds in the cjs theory: aa





  ea

, aab

  a, aabcde

a1...6

. however, no supergravity theory was known to contain all these elds in a simple

and natural way.

it was therefore a surprise for us to nd a family of lagrangians (one

in each odd dimension) which could prove the conjecture of cremmer, julia and scherk to

be true [5]. the key ingredients in this new family of supergravity theories is their chern-

simons form and the fact that the spacetime symmetry is realized in the tangent space and

not on the base manifold.

ii. supergravity in odd dimensions

one of the unique features of gravity in 2+1 dimensions is that it is a genuine gauge

theory in the sense of having a ber bundle structure. this is because the standard einstein-

hilbert action (both with and without cosmological constant) is a chern-simons (cs) form

r < ada + 2

3a3 >. as a consequence, the theory is an integrable system, unlike the case of

four-dimensional gravity [6]. furthermore, the simplest d = 3, n = 1 supegravity theory

[7] also shares this feature, and as a bonus, the theory is locally invariant under the anti-de

2

sitter group. it is easy to see that these features can be generalized to all odd dimensions:

provided one has identied the superalgebra that extends ads in a given dimension d, it is

just a matter of constructing the appropriate chern-simons d-form. the resulting theory

would be invariant by construction under the right supergroup in which the elds of the

theory transform as dierent pieces of a connection. thus, the algebra of the supersymmetry

transformations is guaranteed to close o shell without requiring auxiliary elds [8].

however, both identifying the algebra and the construction of the cs form involve some

subtleties that it is instructive to analyze in detail. the simplest example that captures all

the problems and which yields a theory with propagating local degrees of freedom occurs

in ve dimensions. in the following we study the ve-dimensional case in detail and indicate

where appropriate how the results generalize to other dimensions.

iii. higher dimensional cs theories

in 2+1 dimensions, gravity or any other chern-simons theory for that matter has no

dynamical degrees of freedom. the eld equations are

f = 0,

(1)

where f is the (anti-de sitter or poincare) curvature, and it therefore means that all on-shell

congurations are locally gauge-equivalent to a at connection. however, the eld equations

of a cs theory in dimensions ve and higher for any gauge group take the form

< f f     f gm >= 0,

(2)

where gm is a gauge generator. this equation in general does not imply a at connection,

allowing for the existence of propagating degrees of freedom.

for dimensions d > 3, the dynamical structure of a cs system becomes highly nontrivial.

the root of the complexity lies in three independent features inherent of cs theories: i) they

are gauge systems; ii) they have coordinate invariance built in; and iii) they are rst order

3

systems. although each of these items are neither exclusive of cs systems, nor particularly

dicult to deal with, their conjunction requires special care. as discussed in [9], there are

two problems: dieomorphism and gauge invariances are not completely independent, and

because of the rst order nature, cs systems have rst class constraints inextricably mixed

with second class ones. this makes the dirac matrix hard to express in a simple form and

almost impossible to invert.

moreover, for d > 3 the symplectic form () that multiplies the velocities in (2) is a

function of the gauge eld  = (a), and it can degenerate for certain eld congurations.

in particular, for d = 5,

ij

m n (a) = m n p ijklfp
kl,

(3)

where m n p < gm gn gp > is an invariant tensor of the gauge group (see appendix b).

at the singular congurations (as fp

kl = 0), the rank of the dirac matrix is reduced and

becomes noninvertible, so that some (or all) second class constraints could actually be viewed

as rst class, and this further complicates the identication of the propagating degrees of

freedom. outside those regions, however, other dynamical structure is well behaved and the

symplectic form has maximal rank.

here we will not discuss the problems arising from the presence of degenerate surfaces.

this seems to be a reasonable point of view as these singularities constitute sets of measure

zero in the conguration space of the theory.

the dynamical analysis of a higher-dimensional bosonic cs theory is discussed in [9] and

we summarize it here: if the gauge algebra takes the form g u(1), where g is a semisimple

algebra, the symplectic form can be computed in a background where  has maximal rank.

the congurations that satisfy this requirement are called generic in the sense that under

small deformations the rank of  remains maximal. also, in these congurations, the rst

and second class constraints can be separated and the degrees of freedom computed. if the

algebra has dimension f > 1 and the spacetime has dimension d = 2n + 1 > 3, it is shown

that the number of propagating local degrees of freedom of the theory is

4

g = nf  f  n

and, in ve dimensions, the symplectic matrix has the form

m n ( a) = gm n ijklfkl,
ij

(4)

where the bar stands for background elds, and fkl = kbl lbk is the curvature of the u(1)

eld.

iv. local ads5 supergravity

the supersymmetric extension of the anti-de sitter algebra in ve dimensions is

su(2, 2|n) [10], whose associated connection can be written as,

a =eaja +

1
2

abjab + at + ( rqr  qrr) + bz,

where the generators ja, jab, form an ads algebra (so(4, 2)), t ( = 1,   n 2  1) are the

generators of su(n), z generates a u(1) subgroup and q, q are the supersymmetry gener-

ators, which transform in a vector representation of su(n). the chern-simons lagrangian

for this gauge algebra is dened by the relation dl = i < f3 >, where f = da+ a2 is

the (antihermitean) curvature, and <    > stands for the supertrace in the representation

described in the appendix a. using this denition, one obtains the lagrangian originally

discussed by chamseddine in [11],

l = lg(ab, ea) + lsu(n )(ar

s) + lu(1)(ab, ea, b) + lf (ab, ea, ar

where d is the lorentz covariant derivative.

the above relation implies that the fermions carry a u(1) electric charge given by

4  1

e = (cid:0) 1

n(cid:1). the purely gravitational part, lg is equal to the standard einstein-hilbert

action with cosmological constant, plus the dimensionally continued euler density1.

the action is by construction invariant up to a surface term under the local (gauge

generated) supersymmetry transformations a = (d + [a, ]) with  = rqr  qrr, or

b = i(cid:0)rr  rr(cid:1) .

as can be seen from (6) and (7), for n = 4 the b eld looses its kinetic term and decouples

from the fermions (the gravitino becomes uncharged with respect to the u(1) eld). the

only remnant of the interaction with the b eld is a dilaton-like coupling with the pontryagin

four forms for the ads and su(n) groups (in the bosonic sector). as it is also shown in

1the rst term in lg is the dimensional continuation of the euler (or gauss-bonnet) density

from two and four dimensions, exactly as the three-dimensional einstein-hilbert lagrangian is

the continuation of the the two dimensional euler density. this is the leading term in the limit of

vanishing cosmological constant (l  ), whose local supersymmetric extension yields a nontrivial

extension of the poincare group [12].

6

the appendix a, the case n = 4 is also special at the level of the algebra, which becomes a

superalgebra with a u(1) central extension.

in the bosonic sector, for n = 4, the eld equation obtained from the variation with

respect to b states that the pontryagin four form of ads and su(n) groups are proportional

. consequently, if the curvatures approach zero suciently fast at spatial innity, there is

a conserved topological current which states that, for the spatial section, the second chern

characters of ads and su(4) are proportional. consequently, if the spatial section has no

boundary, the corresponding chern numbers are related. using the fact that 4(su(4)) = 0,

the above implies that the hirzebruch signature plus the nieh-yan number of the spatial

section cannot change in time.

v. symplectic form

we will consider a background that is a solution for the eld equations, for which 

has maximum rank. realizing this is in general a dicult task. however, an amazing

simplication happen when n = 4, which has its root in the form of the invariant tensor

m n p . as stated in the appendix, considering the spliting: m = {m , z}, when n = 4 we

have the accident: zzz = 0, and zm n  =  i

4 gm n  , where gm n  is the killing metric

of p su(2, 2|4).

this fact will help us nd an adequate background. consider any locally ads spacetime

with pure gauge matter elds (bosons and fermions), with the exception of the b eld. that

is, a background a such that fab = f = s= 

r

= 0 6= fz.

it is easy to see also that for n = 4 the conditions that make the separation between

rst and second class constraints possible in the construction of [9] can also be applied, even

if in this case the algebra is bigraded and not a direct sum of a semisimple one and u(1),

but a central extension.

indeed, it can be directly checked that the symplectic form takes the form

7

(8)

m n  is generically an invertible matrix. in fact, for a at ads curvature (e.g., a

the nonvanishing block in the rhs can be recognized as the killing metric for

p su(2, 2|4), while the factor on the right is the space-dual of the b eld, db.

this shows that the requirement for the algebra to be of the form g  u(1) in order to

decouple rst and second class constraints is sucient but not necessary. in general, any

semisimple (super) group with a u(1) central extension [as in case of n = 4 super ads5

discussed above] will be sucient too.

one can now count the degrees of freedom for the eective theory in this background.

there are 15 generators of ads5, 15 for su(2, 2), and 1 for u(1), plus 4  4 qi

s and an

equal number of q

i s. according to the argument outlined in [9], this makes f = 63, n = 2,

and a total of 61 independently propagating degrees of freedom.

the previous result is puzzling. there can be no matching of fermionic and bosonic

degrees of freedom in this case. in fact, there seems to be a hidden subtlety in this counting

because, at least in the perturbative sense, the number of degrees of freedom around this

background is dierent. consider a uctuation in the connection around a xed background

a ,

am = am + um ,

(10)

8

where the dynamical elds will be the spatial components of a = am gm , with m ranging

over the whole supergroup indices. then, for small u, the eective action in the linearized

approximation, is given by

ief f (um

m n ( a) 0un

if we consider the ads background where ij

m n ( a) takes the form (8), then the counting

comes to 58.

vi. discussion and outlook

1. from the previous discussion it is clear that for n = 4 the theory is extremely

simple and the b eld almost completely decouples from the rest of the elds. in fact, the

b eld is analogous to a lagrange multiplier, and this analogy is completely accurate in

the eective action for the perturbations, where the perturbation associated with this eld

doesnt appear at all in the eective action. actually, around the same ads background

one cannot distinguish between the eective linearized theory described above from that

containing only the kahler-cs like action [13] described by the second term of lu(1) . we

will discuss this issue in detail elsewhere.

2. another important problem is to show that the algebra generated by the conserved

charges reproduces an algebra which is not isomorphic to the gauge algebra su(2, 2|4), but

is a non-trivial central extension of psu(2, 2|4). here the result is that this is indeed the case

and that the algebra sets bounds to the values of the charges and conditions for the existence

of killing spinors that ensure that the background saturates the bogomolnyi bound. this

issue, in turn, raises the question of identifying the nontrivial bps states. these states must

keep a fraction of supersymmetry; in fact a solution of the eld equations with these features

is some sort of topological black hole [14] and it is reassuring to verify that the extreme

case saturates the bound. these problems are going to be discussed in a forthcoming article.

3. the ve dimensional theory generates a new four-dimensional superconformal theory

at the boundary. this theory is constructed on the generalization of the kac-moody exten-

sion of the superconformal algebra without central charge, that is, the wzw4 algebra for

p su(2, 2|1). this theory could be a rich test ground in the context of ads/cft duality

conjecture [15].

4. another interesting problem is try to generalize what is known about d = 5 to higher

dimensions. we have shown [5] that the d = 11, n = 32 theory admits a nontrivial extension

of the ads superalgebra with one abelian generator for which anti-de sitter space without

matter elds is a background of maximal rank, and the gauge superalgebra is realized in the

dirac brackets. on a background like the used in the ve dimensional theory, the d = 11

theory has 212 fermionic and 212  1 bosonic degrees of freedom, and the (super) charges

obey a non-trivial central extension of the osp (32|32) algebra.

vii. appendices

appendix a: supersymmetric extension of ads5 algebra

as discussed in [10], [8], the supersymmetric extension of the anti-de sitter algebra in

ve dimensions is su(2, 2|n). this is the lie algebra associated with the invariance group

of the quadratic form q = g + zrurszs, with ,  = 1, ..., 4 and r, s = 1, ..., n. here

 are complex grassmann numbers and g and upq are sesquilinear metrics, which will

be chosen as g = i(0) and urs = rs. the supersymmetric algebra contains su(2, 2) 

su(n)  u(1) as the bosonic subalgebra. using the isomorphism: su(2, 2)  so(4, 2), the

generators are composed by the ads generators (jab), with a, b = 0, ...5, the 2  4n

(complex) supersymmetry generators (q

r , qr

), and the rest of the algebra is composed by

the generators of internal (lorentz scalar) su(n)  u(1) (t, z), with  = 1, ..., n 2  1.

a natural representation acting in the vector superspace (; zq) is given by (4 + n)

it is clear from the algebra that the case n = 4 is a special one: the generator z

commutes with the rest of the algebra and it is just a central extension, as can be read from

the right hand of (a8).

it is important to point out that, if z were omitted, the new algebra, psu(2, 2|4), does

not admit the representation described above, but still satises the jacobi identity. because

of this last feature, the full resulting algebra for n = 4, is not psu(2, 2|4)  u(1).

appendix b: third rank invariant tensor for n extended

super ads5

from the matrix representation described above, it is straighforward to obtain a third

rank invariant tensor for the ads5 supergroup, which is needed to analyze the dynamics of

local ads5 supergravity.

let gm the generators of su(2, 2|n), where the index m ranks from the whole superal-

gebra: m =(cid:8)[ab], , z, (r

) ,(cid:0)
s(cid:1)(cid:9).

the required tensor is dened through m n p = < gm , gn , gp >, where < ... > stands

for the supertrace, which ensure the invariance of the tensor under the action of the group.

because the supertrace is the dierence between the trace of the upper and lower diagonal

bosonic blocks, the invariant tensor has the form:
