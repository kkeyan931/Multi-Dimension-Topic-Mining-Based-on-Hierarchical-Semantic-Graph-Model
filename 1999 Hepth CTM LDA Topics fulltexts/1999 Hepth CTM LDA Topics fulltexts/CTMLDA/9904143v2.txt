abstract

an ads2 black hole spacetime is an ads2 spacetime together with a preferred choice
of time. the boulware, hartle-hawking and sl(2, r) invariant vacua are constructed, to-

gether with their green functions and stress tensors, for both massive and massless scalars

in an ads2 black hole. the classical bekenstein-hawking entropy is found to be indepen-
dent of the temperature, but at one loop a non-zero entanglement entropy arises. this

represents a logarithmic violation of nite-temperature decoupling for ads2 black holes
which arise in the near-horizon limit of an asymptotically at black hole. correlation func-

tions of the sl(2, r) invariant boundary quantum mechanics are computed as functions

of the choice of ads2 vacuum.

1. introduction

two-dimensional anti-desitter space (ads2) has arisen in at least three distinct but

related contexts within string/black hole physics. the rst is as the near-horizon geometry
(together with an s2 factor) of the extremal reissner-nordstrom solution [1]. ads2 is a
stable attractor solution of the equations which govern how the geometry changes as the

horizon is approached [2], and as such is expected to play a central role in the physics

of black holes. ads2 made a second appearance in studies of two-dimensional quantum

gravity, where it provides an sl(2, r) invariant ground state for liouville gravity [3,4],

and a rich arena for the study of two-dimensional black holes [5-9]. most recently it is

the black sheep in the family of ads/cf t dualities [10], having so far resisted a fully

satisfactory realization of the duality [11-16]. one hopes that this can be remedied and

that in the process a clearer relation between the dierent aspects of ads2 physics will

emerge.

in this paper we investigate properties of both massive and massless quantum eld

theory on an ads2 background. in section 2 we review the appearance of ads2 in near-

horizon black hole geometries. this motivates the denition of an ads2 black hole as

an ads2 spacetime together with a preferred choice of time.

in section 3 it is shown

in the quantum theory that the choice of time aects the vacuum state. we discuss the

hartle-hawking, boulware and sl(2, r) invariant ads2 black hole vacua and the hawking

temperature measured by various families of observers. it is shown that the vacua dened

with respect to poincare or global time are equivalent to one another and to the hartle-

hawking-vacuum. the boulware vacuum, which is associated to the preferred choice of

time, is not in general equivalent. section 4 concerns the entropy of an ads2 black hole.

the classical bekenstein-hawking entropy is temperature-independent. at one loop there

is an entanglement entropy which depends logarithmically on the hawking temperature.

this represents a violation of low-energy decoupling between the asymptotically at and

near-horizon regions of the black hole at nite temperature.

in section 5 we analyze

processes in which the temperature is changed by sending matter into the black hole. in

section 6 we turn to massive elds, and give explicit expressions for the green functions

in the boulware and hartle-hawking vacua. the stress-energy expectation values in these

vacua are computed in section 7. in section 8, motivated by the ads/cf t duality, we

compute correlation functions of the sl(2, r) invariant boundary quantum mechanics in

the various ads2 vacua.

2. ads2 black holes in the near-horizon limit

in three dimensions, all negative curvature spaces are locally equivalent to ads3.
because of this, for many years it was believed that black holes did not exist for pure gravity

in three dimensions. however, btz showed that black holes do exist which dier from

ads3 only by global identications [17]. the local geometry at the black hole horizon is the
same as everywhere else, but it is globally characterized as the surface from behind which

nothing can communicate with innity. this diers from higher dimensional examples in

which the geometry has special features at the horizon.

in two dimensions, all negative curvature spaces are locally ads2. we will argue that,
much as in three dimensions, ads2 black holes nevertheless exist in pure gravity (without
dilatons). similar discussions have appeared in [5,18]. one way to describe this is that an

ads2 black hole is ads2 together with a choice of (killing) time t at innity for which the
full region  < t <  does not cover all of the boundary of ads2. the black hole horizon
is then the surface from behind which nothing can escape to the region  < t < . we
will see that the black holes so dened have characteristic thermodynamic properties.

ads2 black holes naturally arise in the near-horizon limits of reissner-nordstrom

black holes. following the discussion of [12], the full magnetically-charged solution is

chain of universes.

since th can be eliminated by a coordinate transformation, the classical near horizon

theory is independent of th . we shall see in the next section that this is not the case in the

quantum theory, because the denition of a vacuum state in general depends on a choice of

time, or equivalently a preferred family of observers. an ads2 spacetime which arises as the

near horizon geometry of reissner-nordstrom is indeed endowed with a preferred choice

of time t, namely, the one associated to the killing vector which generates unit time

translations in the asymptotically at spatial innity of the reissner-nordstrom geometry.

as is evident from gure 2, as this preferred time coordinate t runs over the full range
 < t < +, only part of of the timelike boundaries of ads2 is covered. we shall
refer to this boundary region as spatial innity. the future black hole horizon can then be

dened as the boundary of the region from which nothing can escape to spatial innity.

the past horizon is then the boundary of the region which cannot be accessed from spatial

innity. these horizons coincide with the killing horizon of the preferred killing vector.

in the extremal case th = 0 depicted in gure 2a, the exterior of the black hole is a
wedge, the corner of which extend to the far boundary of ads2. for th 6= 0 (gure 2b),
the exterior of the black hole is still a wedge, but it extends only halfway across ads2.

3. ads2 black hole thermodynamics

in this section we discuss the thermal properties of ads2 black holes. we consider

mainly the case of a free massless scalar eld, deferring the massive case to section 6.

4

3.1. the quantum state

in order to dene a vacuum state we need a metric with a timelike killing vector. the

vacuum is then dened as the state annihilated by positive frequency modes of the eld

operator. observers at a xed spatial coordinate x, in a coordinate system in which the

metric is time-independent, then detect no particles.

for ads2 there are inequivalent choices of time coordinates or equivalently conformal

gauge coordinates. for one such coordinate choice the metric takes the form

ds2
q2l2
p

= d 2 + d2

cos2 

.

(3.1)

the coordinates (, ) are referred to as global coordinates because they cover all of (the
2 and  <  < . spatial innity is at  =  
universal cover of) ads2 for  
2 ,
and the horizons are at    = 0. the corresponding vacuum |0globali, annihilated by
modes which are positive frequency with respect to  , is the familiar sl(2, r) invariant

2    

vacuum for a free scalar eld on the strip. we shall see shortly that this is equivalent to

the hartle-hawking black hole vacuum as well as the poincare vacuum.

a second coordinate system is the schwarzschild coordinates, which uses the time

t appearing in (2.5). t coincides with the time coordinate inherited from the decoupled

asymptotically at region and, as discussed above, denes the black hole horizon. (2.5)

can be transformed to conformal gauge by

(3.2)

(3.3)

since the coordinate transformation (3.2) involves only the spatial coordinate and does
not change the choice of time, it does not aect the associated vacuum |0schwarzschildi.

the schwarzschild coordinates (t, x) and global coordinates (, ) are related by the

coordinate transformation

tan 1

2 (  ) = e2th (tx).

(3.4)

a natural family of observers are those moving along worldlines of xed u . this

corresponds to trajectories which remain a xed distance from the black hole horizon.

5

since the proper time along such worldlines equals schwarzschild time (up to a constant),
such observers will not detect any particles in the state |0schwarzschildi. the vacuum with
this property is known as the boulware vacuum. hence we conclude that

|0schwarzschildi = |0boulwarei.

(3.5)

we will see in section 7 that this vacuum has the property that the expectation value of

the stress tensor diverges on the horizon.

since schwarzschild and global time do not agree, constant-u observers will detect

particles in the global vacuum. the transition probabilities for a detector on a constant u -
worldline are determined from the green functions in the global (, ) vacuum |0globali. it
follows from (3.4) that with respect to the proper time d along the detector worldline these
are thermal green functions, simply because the (, ) coordinates are invariant under
imaginary shifts t  t + i
the detector sees a thermal bath of particles at temperature pg00th = 1

. accounting for the dierence between t and proper time d,
2q sinh(2thx).
the vacuum with this property is known as the hartle-hawking vacuum. hence we con-

th

clude that

yet another way to dene a vacuum is as the state annihilated by modes which are

|0globali = |0hartlehawkingi.

 < t <  and 0 < y <  these coordinates cover only the patch dened by  +  <

are illustrated in gure 3). these coordinates are related to the global coordinates by the

formation is block diagonal, and it follows that the poincare annihilation operators are

linear combinations of the global annihilation operators and have no overlap with the

global creation operators, and hence

|0globali = |0poincarei.

(3.12)

this result will be conrmed by the computation of the green functions for massive scalars

in section 6. the equivalence of the global and poincare vacua in adsn has been discussed
in [19].

(3.13)

hence the vacuum associated to the coordinates (3.3) reduces to the sl(2, r) invariant
poincare vacuum associated to the coordinates (3.13) in the limit th  0. the hawking
temperature th can be thought of as a measure of the non-sl(2, r) invariance of the

vacuum state associated to (3.3).

4. entanglement entropy

the presence of a thermal bath of particles around an ads2 black hole would normally

imply an associated temperature-dependent entropy. however in the near-horizon limit

(2.3), (2.4) one nds that

sbh  q2,

(4.1)

independently of th . this means that there is no classical temperature-dependent en-

tropy. however at the one loop level there is a quantum correction to the entropy from

the entanglement of the near-horizon ads2 hilbert space with the hilbert space of the

decoupled asymptotically at region. (strictly speaking when this entropy is nonzero the

asymptotically at region is not fully decoupled.)

in order to compute this entropy one needs to be more precise about how the near-

horizon ads2 region of the reissner-nordstrom black hole is separated from the asymp-
totically at region in the lp  0 limit. before taking lp all the way to zero let us choose
a xed value of radial coordinate u = umax which divides the spacetime so that the ads2
region is 0 < u < umax while the at region is umax < u < . umax should be in the
mouth region where the geometry changes from ads2 to at, so we take umax = c0
.

q
lp
the arbitrary constant c0 can be taken to be very small so that the boundary is deep in
the ads2 region, but is held xed as lp  0, so that umax  . we then erect the
hilbert space of, e.g., a scalar eld on both regions, with bases denoted |i
flati.
a generic state of the quantum eld on the reissner-nordstrom spacetime  including the

adsi and |j

vacuum state  is a sum of product states of the form

|i =xij

cij|i

adsi|j

flati.

8

(4.2)

the state on the ads2 region is then a density matrix

ads = trflat|ih| =xijk

cik cjk|i

adsihj

ads|.

alternately the state on the at region is

flat = trads|ih| =xijk

the entanglement entropy is then dened by

cki ckj|i

flatihj

flat|.

sent = tr ln ,

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

and takes the same value for either flat or ads. sent is a measure of the correlation

between the portions of the quantum state on the two regions.

entanglement entropy for black holes has been discussed in [20-25]. in general there

are divergences arising from the entanglement of arbitrarily short wavelength modes which

overlap the dividing line umax. we are interested in nite, temperature-dependent contri-

butions to sent for the vacuum state on the reissner-nordstrom geometry. such a term

arises from the s-wave modes of scalar elds, which reduces to a conformal eld on ads2.

the vacuum entanglement entropy for a conformal eld theory of central charge charge c

in curved space was derived in [24,27] as

sent =

c
6

(max) 

c
6

ln .

(4.6)

in this expression, (max) is the metric conformal factor in the coordinate system used

to dene the vacuum evaluated at the dividing line between the two regions, and  is a

non-universal short-distance cuto.

the hartle-hawking vacuum for an ads2 black hole is dened with respect to the

global coordinates (3.1), in which

for small lp, umax is large and from (2.6) and (2.8) we have

 =  ln cos .

(4.7)

(4.8)

it follows that

sent = 

c
6

ln(qth) + non  universal.

(4.9)

related (although not obviously equivalent) results were obtained with euclidean methods

in [9].

expression (4.9) represents a logarithmic violation of decoupling in the near horizon

limit at nite temperature between the at region and the ads2 region. additional con-

tributions to the entanglement entropy could arise from massive elds as well as higher

angular modes of massless elds. however it is not clear if these contributions will survive

the near horizon limit since the modes of such elds vanish rapidly near the boundary of

ads2. it would be interesting to compute sent in string theory examples and to investigate

its origin in the d-brane picture.

5. making an ads2 black hole

in this section we consider simple processes which change the temperature of the black

hole. a general spherically symmetric solution of einstein-maxwell gravity corresponding

to null matter falling in to a reissner-nordstrom black hole is

(r  r+(v))(r  r(v))

r2

ds2 = 
f = q2,

dv2 + 2drdv + r2d2
2,

(5.1)

with r+r = l2

pq2. the null matter has only one nonzero component of its stress tensor:

tvv =

vr+(v) + vr(v)

4l2

pr2

.

(5.2)

let us start with an extreme reissner-nordstrom black hole (r = r+) and send in a null
shockwave of the form

tvv =

q3t 2
0 lp(v)
r2

,

(5.3)

where t0 is a constant with units of temperature. the meaning of this particular form will

shortly be clear. from (5.2) we see that this leads to

r+ + r = 2qlp
v < 0,
r+ + r = 2qlp + 42q3t 2

0 l3
p

v > 0.

10

(5.4)

using r+r = q2l2

p one can solve to nd

v < 0,

r = qlp
r = qlp [1  2qt0lp] + o(l3
p)

v > 0,

(5.5)

where the higher-order corrections in lp will not be important. we see then that the
hawking temperature th = r+r
4r2
+

is

th = 0

v < 0,

th = t0 + o(lp)

v > 0.

(5.6)

the shockwave (5.3) increases the hawking temperature of the black hole from zero to th,
at least in the lp  0 limit.

now we consider a near horizon limit

with

lp  0,

u =

r  r+
l2
p

,

q, t0 xed.

the two-dimensional metric then reduces to

ds2

p

= 

u (u + 4q2t0(v))

q2

dv2 + 2du dv.

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

we note that in this limit the energy density (5.2) vanishes. in terms of the coordinates

s = v,

s+ = v +

the metric (5.9) takes the poincare form

a detector at xed u = u0 hence has a worldline

s < 0,

s+ = s(1 + 4q2t0

) +

s > 0.

(5.10)

(5.11)

(5.12)

the proper time d along the detector worldline is

d = qu0s

s < 0,

1

d =

2qt0pu0(u0 + 4q2t0) ln(1 + 2q2t0s)

s > 0.

(5.13)

since poincare time and worldline time are proportional prior to the shock wave, there

will be no particle detection in this region. however, after the shock wave, it follows from
(5.10) that s is periodic under imaginary shifts of detector proper time. this implies
that the detector will detect a thermal bath of radiation at temperature

t = t0

q

pu0(u0 + 4q2t0)

.

(5.14)

the rst factor of t0 is the black hole temperature, while the second is the tolman fac-
tor representing the usual position-dependent temperature for thermal equilibrium in a

gravitational eld.

in conclusion, (5.9) represents an ads2 black hole whose temperature grows as a
function of the null coordinate v because matter is being thrown in. a detector stationed

at xed u outside the black hole detects a thermal bath of radiation whose temperature

grows as the matter is thrown in.

6. massive fields and vacua

in this section we extend the previous discussion to the case of massive elds. for the

remainder of this paper we set qlp = 1. the proper dependence may be restored using
dimensional analysis.

6.1. green functions

we consider a massive scalar eld  with action

s = 

1

2z d2xg(cid:2)()2 + m22(cid:3) .

(6.1)

the vacuum |0i is completely specied by the two-point function g(x, y) = h0|(x)(y)|0i.
in lorentzian spacetimes there are many green functions.3 we focus on the hadamard

function

g(1)(x, y) = h0|{(x), (y)}|0i,

(6.2)

3 a discussion can be found in chapter 4 of [28].

12

which is related to the familiar feynman propagator gf (x, y) = ih0|t (x)(y)|0i by
g(1) = 2 im gf . to construct the hadamard function explicitly for a given vacuum one
rst nds a complete set of positive frequency solutions (i.e.   eit where t is the
chosen time variable) of the massive wave equation

2 = m2,

(6.3)

normalized with respect to the klein-gordon inner product, which in conformal gauge

takes the form

h|i = iz

[(t )  (t) ] ,

(6.4)

where the integral is taken over a constant-time slice . we encounter bases {(y)}
dened on the half-plane y  0 which oscillate as y   and hence are not integrable.
these modes are normalized by requiring that

(y) 

1


sin(y + )

as y  .

this gives the correct relativistic delta-function normalization

h|i = 2z 

0

dy  = (  ).

once the modes are known, the hadamard function is given by

g(1)(x, y) = 2 rez d (x)(y).

if the spectrum of  is discrete then the integrals should be replaced by sums.

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

6.2. the global vacuum

in this subsection we construct the green function associated with the global vacuum.

the wave equation for a massive scalar in global coordinates is

 + 2

(cid:2)cos2  (2

)  h(h  1)(cid:3)  = 0,

(6.8)

where we write m2 = h(h  1). the normalized positive-frequency solutions are [13]

n = (h)2h1s

n!

(n + 2h)

ei(n+h) (cos )hch

n(sin ),

n = 0, 1, . . . ,

(6.9)

13

where ch

n is the gegenbauer polynomial ([29] 8.930). the hadamard function (6.7) for

the global vacuum is therefore

the correct short-distance singularity, g(1)

which is the correct massless green function on the strip, as may be seen by summing

the massless green function on the plane over a collection of image eld sources. this is

required by the conformal invariance of a massless scalar.

one may explicitly check that the the same green function is obtained in poincare

coordinates (3.7), as expected from the equivalence of the corresponding vacua. the mas-
sive wave equation in poincare coordinates for a positive-frequency mode  = eit (y)

(the integral appears in [30]) where

2y1y2

(6.16)

(6.17)

is the sl(2, r) invariant distance function in poincare coordinates. (6.16) agrees precisely

with (6.11) as anticipated. for a massless scalar (h = 1) we recover

g(1)
poincare =

ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

(6.18)

which is the usual massless green function on the half plane, as required by conformal

invariance. the term in the denominator can be thought of as coming from an image eld
source at y2 = y2.

6.3. the boulware vacuum

in this subsection we construct the boulware green function. for convenience we
temporarily set 2th = 1. one can restore th simply by taking (t, x)  2th(t, x). the
massive wave equation for a positive frequency solution  = eit(x) reads

(cid:20) 2
x2 + 2 

sinh2 x (cid:21) (x) = 0.

the solution which vanishes at x = 0 is

(6.19)

where p is the associated legendre function and we have normalized according to (6.5).

which again is the correct massless green function on the half plane. since it is impossible

to rewrite (6.23) as a function of the sl(2, r) invariant distance

dboulware(t1, x1; t2, x2) =  cosh(2th(t1  t2)) + cosh(2th(x1  x2))

sinh(2thx1) sinh(2thx2)

,

(6.24)

we discover that the boulware vacuum is not sl(2, r) invariant. in particular, it is distinct

from the global vacuum.

using a recursion relation satised by the legendre functions one can write down a

(very complicated) expression which gives the value of the integral (6.23) for any positive

integer h in terms of sums of logarithms and exponential-integral functions ei(z) ([29]

8.211). the formulas involved are lengthy and not illuminating. for example, for h = 2

one nds

g(1)

boulware = (coth x1 coth x2)g(1)

b,(h=1) 

1

4 xa,b,c=1

ei(a(t1  t2) + bx1 + cx2)
ea(t1t2) sinh bx1 sinh cx2

.

(6.25)

one can check that g(1)
boulware constructed in this way satises the massive wave equation
(6.19), has the correct short-distance singularity g(1)
 ln||, and vanishes as
xh when x  0. these properties ensure that the boulware vacuum is a good vacuum,
although it is singular along the horizon at x = .

boulware   1

furthermore, by restoring (t, x)  2th(t, x) one can verify that in the limit th  0,
the hadamard function for the boulware vacuum reduces to that of the global vacuum

(6.16) (with (t, r) replaced by (t, x)), in agreement with the fact that the coordinate

systems coincide for th = 0 (3.13). thus the hawking temperature th is a measure of

the non-sl(2, r) invariance of the boulware vacuum.

7. the stress tensor

the various vacua in ads2 are characterized by diering stress tensor expectation

values. in this section we compute these expectation values for both the massless and the

massive case.

7.1. two-dimensional rindler and minkowski space

we begin with a review of some well-known features of the thermodynamics of two-

dimensional rindler space. this will clarify the meaning of the various ads2 expressions.

readers familiar with this topic should skip to the next subsection.

the rindler metric

ds2 = e(u +u )du +du

(7.1)

is related to the minkowski metric ds2 = du+du by the coordinate transformation

u = 

1


ln(u),

(7.2)

where  is a constant. lines of constant u +u correspond to the worldlines of observers
undergoing constant proper acceleration  (see gure 4).

consider a massless scalar eld in minkowski space. we may construct the stress
tensor operator t normal-ordered with respect to minkowski coordinates, u, or with
respect to rindler coordinates u. these two operators are related by the well-known
formula

(7.3)

u +(cid:19)2
t++(u +) =(cid:18) u+

t++(u+) +

1

12r u+

u +

2

u +2r u +
u+ .

here and henceforth the stress tensor in a given coordinate system is always normal-ordered

with respect to that coordinate system. the dierence in the two stress tensors reects

the fact that observers which are stationary with respect to dierent coordinate systems

detect dierent particle densities. plugging in (7.2) gives

t++(u +) = e2u +

t++(u+) +

2
48

.

taking the expectation value of (7.4) in the minkowski vacuum gives

ht++(u +)im =

2
48

,

17

(7.4)

(7.5)

which is the stress-energy density of a thermal bath of particles at temperature t = 

2 .4
this may be interpreted as radiation coming from the rindler horizon. on the other hand,

taking the expectation value of (7.4) in the rindler vacuum gives

ht++(u+)ir = 

1

48(u+)2 ,

(7.6)

which can be viewed as a divergent casimir energy arising from the presence of a boundary
at the rindler horizon u+ = 0.

so far we have ignored the other independent component of hti, which is determined

by the trace anomaly formula

ht+i =

1
2

g+hti =

r
48

g+.

(7.7)

this vanishes for rindler/minkowski space but plays a role in ads2, where r = 2.

the stress tensor for massive scalars in rindler space has been constructed in [33].

to a rindler observer that accelerates uniformly to the right. the dashed lines show the

past and future horizon (the rindler horizon) seen by such an observer.

7.2. massless scalar in ads2

we now calculate the stress energy for a massless scalar in ads2. the results are

essentially identical to those we obtained in the previous subsection. it is convenient to

4 this temperature is related to the fact that the coordinate transformation (7.2) is periodic in
, so that any green function constructed in rindler

imaginary rindler time with periodicity  = 2



coordinates would also be periodic in imaginary rindler time and would therefore correspond to
a thermal green function at temperature 1.

,

where the null coordinates are dened by

2thu = 2th(t  x) = ln(t  y) = ln u.

(7.8)

(7.9)

(7.10)

where t++(u +) is the stress tensor normal-ordered in the schwarzschild coordinates and
t++(u+) is the stress tensor normal-ordered in the poincare coordinates. taking the
expectation of this equation in the global vacuum gives

ht++(u +)iglobal =

t 2
h
12

,

(7.11)

which is the stress-energy density of a thermal bath of particles at temperature th (again
this is to be expected by virtue of the periodicity of the coordinate transformation (7.9)

in imaginary imaginary schwarzschild time). on the other hand, taking the expectation

value of (7.10) in the boulware vacuum gives

ht++(u+)iboulware = 

1

48(u+)2 ,

(7.12)

which may be viewed as casimir energy arising from a boundary at the black hole horizon.

so far we have discussed the stress tensor in schwarzschild and poincare coordinates.

which is the familiar zero-point shift of a c = 1 theory on the strip. curiously, normal-

ordering in poincare and global coordinates lead to dierent shifts even though the associ-

ated vacua are identical. this is possible because in the former case one uses a continuous

set of modes, while in the latter one uses a discrete set, and so the innite zero-point

energy sums are regulated dierently. the fact that the expectation value of the stress

tensor in the global vacuum vanishes in poincare coordinates but not in global coordinates

also follows from sl(2, r) invariance, together with the observation that the inhomoge-

nous term in (7.3) vanishes for sl(2, r) transformations in poincare coordinates but not

in global coordinates.

7.3. point-splitting regularization of massive scalars

the calculation of hti for a massive scalar is signicantly more dicult as there
is no simple formula such as (7.3). the calculation is complicated by the fact that the

expectation value of an operator such as t which is quadratic in the eld  is formally

divergent and must be regularized and renormalized. we implement the regularization by
using the point-splitting technique5, reviewed briey below.

the stress tensor for a massive scalar eld  is

in conformal gauge

one has

t (x) =

g(cid:0)g + m22(cid:1) .

ds2 = e2dw+dw,

t++ = ++,

t+ = t+ =

t = ,

g+m22.

(7.16)

(7.17)

(7.18)

following [35], we dene the point-split stress tensor operator as follows. consider any
non-null geodesic through x, and let x() = (w+(), w()) be the point on the geodesic
at a proper distance  > 0 from x. the geodesic may be characterized by its normalized
tangent vector at x,  

0   (0), where
dx()

=  (),

d

  = e2 +   = 1.

(7.19)

these factors arises because +(x()) must be parallel transported back to x(0) in order
to obtain a quantity which transforms as a tensor [34]. upon taking the expectation value

of both sides in some vacuum v , we nd that

and similarly for hti.

behavior

g(1)(w+

2 , w2 ) =

where the dots denote terms which are nite as x2 approaches x1, and the point-split stress

(7.25)

21

where the three functions f1, f2, and f3, which depend only on the point x and not on 
or , encode all of the physical information in the point-split stress tensor. to simplify
the notation we here and henceforth drop the subscript 0 on  . finally, making use of

the fact that g++ = 0 and

1
2



e2 = g+ = 2+,

(7.26)

we can combine both expressions in (7.25) into a single covariant expression for the point-

split stress tensor,

ht (x; ;  )i =

1

8 (cid:20) 

2  16f2(x)(cid:21) (g  2 ) +  (x)

g [ln  + f3(x)] + o( ln ),

m2
4

(7.27)

where  is the traceless tensor whose components in the w coordinate system are

++ =  = f1(x),

+ = + = 0.

(7.28)

the regularized stress tensor ht (x; ,  )i diverges in the limit   0, and further-
more the precise behavior of the divergence depends on the direction of approach  . the

renormalized stress tensor is obtained [35] by discarding all of the terms in (7.27) which
depend explicitly on either  or  ,

ht (x)i = g(cid:20) m2

4

f3(x)  2f2(x)(cid:21) +  (x).

(7.29)

from (7.27) we see that the terms which diverge as   0 are universal and do not
depend upon the particular state under investigation (i.e., they do not depend on the fi).
therefore the divergent terms always cancel out when we calculate the dierences between

stress tensors in dierent vacua.

7.5. energy of the global vacuum

we begin by calculating ht (u+, u)iglobal for the sl(2, r) invariant global vacuum
in poincare coordinates. the only rank 2 symmetric, conserved, sl(2, r) invariant tensor
is g , so we expect that htiglobal = cg for some constant c. in the notation of the
previous subsection we nd

f1 = 0,

f2 =

1 + 3h(h  1)

48

,

f3 = (h) + .

(7.30)

22

where (z) =  ln (z)/z and  = (1) is eulers constant. hence the renormalized
stress tensor (7.29) is

htiglobal =

g

2 (cid:20)

1
12 

h(h  1)

2

(cid:18) 1
2  (h)  (cid:19)(cid:21) .

(7.31)

we have obtained the same result by applying pauli-villars regularization. note that when

h = 1 we recover

hti = 
which is the massless weyl anomaly hti = r

g
24

,

(7.32)

48 g , with r = 2 for ads2.

7.6. energy of the boulware vacuum

this calculation is signicantly more complicated.

in particular, we cannot use
sl(2, r)-invariance to argue that htiboulware is proportional to g , and indeed we
nd that this is not the case. to simplify the resulting expressions slightly we introduce

hti = htiglobal  htiboulware,

(7.33)

with htiglobal given by (7.31), which is the energy dierence between the global and
boulware vacua. (note that ht++i = ht++iboulware since ht++iglobal = 0.) using the
hadamard function (6.21) constructed above, we nd for h = 1, 2, 3 the result

where again z = 2thx. note that when h is an integer the hypergeometric series termi-
nates, giving a polynomial which can be explicitly integrated with relative ease (although

the result is not be expressible in terms of elementary functions but again involves the

exponential-integral function ei(z)). one can also check that both components (7.36)
vanish as th  0, as should be expected. figures 5 and 6 show ht++(x)i and ht+(x)i
for some values of h.

evidence that (7.36) is the correct expression for all values of h is

a) special cases. it correctly reduces to (7.34) for h = 1, 2, 3.

b) conservation. the stress tensor should satisfy t = 0, which in
schwarzschild coordinates gives one nontrivial equation,6

2t 2

sinh2(2thx)


xhti +


xht++i = 0,

(7.37)

where hti = 2g+ht+i, which is indeed obeyed by (7.36).
c) behavior near the boundary. we saw earlier that the schwarzschild modes
behave like   xh near the boundary x = 0. therefore the stress tensor, which
is quadratic in , should vanish as hti  x2(h1) as x  0. again, this can be
checked explicitly for (7.36). in particular, the physical requirement that hti
vanishes at the boundary xes any overall additive constant, and the fact that
g diverges as x2 precludes us from adding any constant multiple of the metric
to hti.
d) behavior near the horizon. finally we can consider the behavior near the
horizon at x  . everything becomes massless suciently close to the horizon.
to see this, note that g  (sinh x)2  0, in which case the lagrangian density
becomes

l = 

1
2

g(cid:2)()2 + m22(cid:3)  

1
2

 ,

(7.38)

6 the other equation essentially says that hti should be time-independent.

24

where the inverse metric in the kinetic term ()2 cancels the zero coming from
g. thus one should expect, and we indeed nd, that for x  1 and any h the

expressions expressions (7.36) tend to the massless values

ht++i 

t 2
h
12

,

ht+i  0,

x  1.

(7.39)

this xes the overall normalization of ht++i, which in turn xes the normalization
of ht+i through the conservation equation (7.37).

8. boundary correlation functions

it is expected [10] that string theory on ads2 can be described as conformally in-

variant quantum mechanics on the boundary of ads2. the conformal invariance of the

1-dimensional boundary theory is a consequence of the so(2, 1) isometry group of ads2.

boundary correlation functions evaluated in any vacuum other than the natural so(2, 1)

invariant vacuum, such as the boulware vacuum, will therefore not be conformally invari-

ant. however, we have seen that the parameter th is a measure of the non-sl(2, r)

invariance of the boulware vacuum, so we expect the nonconformal corrections to bound-
ary correlation functions in the boulware vacuum to vanish as th  0. in this section we
derive these boundary correlators and verify that this is the case.

8.1. brief review

in order to x our conventions and notation we begin with a very quick overview of the

calculation of boundary correlation functions using the bulk propagator. the ads/cf t
duality [10] states that for every bulk eld  there is a corresponding local operator o on
the boundary b, with

where se is the eective action in the bulk and b is the eld  restricted to the boundary
[36,37]. let oh be the boundary operator of conformal weight h which couples to the bulk
scalar  of mass m2 = h(h 1), and let gv (y, z; y, z) be the bulk two-point function of 
in coordinates where the boundary lies at y = 0 and is parametrized by z. this could be

poincare coordinates with (y, z) = (y, t ), schwarzschild coordinates with (y, z) = (x, t),

or global coordinates with (y, z) = (cos ,  ). the subscript v is a reminder that the

25

ze () = eiseff () = ht eirb

boi,

(8.1)

two-point function gv expresses a choice of vacuum. boundary correlation functions will
depend on the choice of vacuum in the ads2 bulk [38,39].

the two-point function should vanish as yh as either point approaches the boundary,
and we dene the bulk-boundary propagator for the corresponding vacuum state by [40]

kv (y, z; z) = lim

y0(cid:2)(y)hgv (y, z; y, z)(cid:3) .

(8.2)

(we ignore overall constants throughout this section). if we are given some boundary data
0(z) for the eld , then we can use (8.2) to extend 0 into the bulk by writing

(y, z) =z dzkv (y, z; z)0(z).

(8.3)

then (y, z) satises the equation of motion in the bulk because k satises the equation

of motion in the variables (y, z). next we plug the solution (8.3) into the action (6.1).

upon integrating by parts, the action can be expressed as the boundary term

s = lim

y0(cid:20) 1

2z dz (y, z)y(y, z)(cid:21) .

(8.4)

in the limit as we take the cuto y  0 the bulk-boundary propagator should approach a
delta-function

so we can replace

then (8.4) becomes

s =

kv (y, z; z)  yh+1(z  z)

(8.6)

(8.7)

the generating function for correlation functions of oh(z) in the boundary theory coupled
to the source 0(z) is given by the exponential of i times (8.7), so recalling (8.2) we nd
that (again, up to constants) [41]

hoh(z)oh(z)iv = lim

y,y0(cid:2)(y)hyh+1ygv (y, z; y, z)(cid:3) .

8.2. correlation functions in the global vacuum

(8.8)

substituting the global vacuum two-point function (in poincare coordinates) (6.16)

into (8.2) gives the familiar bulk-boundary propagator

k(y, t1; t2) =

yh

(y2  (t1  t2)2)h ,

26

(8.9)

which leads to the conformally invariant boundary correlation function

hoh(t )oh(0)iglobal =

1
t 2h .

(8.10)

for purposes of comparison, it will be convenient to write (8.10) in schwarzschild

coordinates. recalling that the relation between the poincare time t and the schwarzschild

time t on the boundary is 2tht = ln t and using the conformal transformation law

o(z) = (zz)ho(z),

we can write (8.10) in the form

hoh(t)oh(0)iglobal =(cid:20)

th

sinh (tht)(cid:21)2h

,

(8.11)

(8.12)

as expected, (8.10) is periodic in imaginary schwarzschild time with periodicity t 1

h and
therefore represents a thermal state at temperature th . for small separations (8.10) has
the universal uv limit hoh(t)oh(0)i  1
t2h , while in the ir limit the two-point function is
exponentially suppressed due to the thermal background, hoh(t)oh(0)iglobal  e2th ht.

8.3. correlation functions in the boulware vacuum

now we apply (8.8) directly to the boulware vacuum without rst constructing the

boulware bulk-boundary propagator kboulware from (8.2). however, one can check that
kboulware is given by the poincare bulk-boundary propagator (8.9) plus correction terms
which are subleading in z  z, so that (8.5) is still satised, and proportional to positive
powers of th, so that kboulware reduces to (8.9) as th  0.

integer, the integral may be done explicitly, and the result is nite in the limit   0 and agrees

precisely with the result we present.
