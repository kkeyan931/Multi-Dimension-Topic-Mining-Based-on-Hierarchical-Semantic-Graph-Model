we derive a new version of the non-abelian stokes theorem for the wilson loop in
the su (n ) case by making use of the coherent state representation on the coset space
su (n )/u (1)n1 = fn1, the ag space. we consider the su (n ) yang-mills theory in the
maximal abelian gauge in which su (n ) is broken down to u (1)n1. first, we show that the
abelian dominance in the string tension follows from this theorem and the abelian-projected
eective gauge theory that was derived by one of the authors. next (but independently),
combining the non-abelian stokes theorem with a novel reformulation of the yang-mills the-
ory recently proposed by one of the authors, we proceed to derive the area law of the wilson
loop in four-dimensional su (n ) yang-mills theory in the maximal abelian gauge. owing to
dimensional reduction, the planar wilson loop at least for the fundamental representation
in four-dimensional su (n ) yang-mills theory can be estimated by the diagonal (abelian)
wilson loop dened in the two-dimensional cp n1 model. this derivation shows that the
fundamental quarks are conned by a single species of magnetic monopole. the origin of
the area law is related to the geometric phase of the wilczek-zee holonomy for u (n  1).
the calculations are performed using the instanton calculus (in the dilute instanton-gas
approximation) and using the large n expansion (in the leading order).

introduction

gell-mann and zweig 1) predicted in the mid-1960s that all hadrons (i.e., baryons
and mesons) are composed of the fundamental constituents having fractional charges,
3 e or  2
 1
3 e, with e being the elementary charge. now, the fundamental constituent
is called the quark and the proposed theory is called the quark model. the predic-
tions of this model are consistent with the results of experiments performed over the
past thirty years. the strong interaction among quarks and anti-quarks is mediated
by the gluon, which is described by the quantized yang-mills gauge eld theory. 2)
the present fundamental theory describing the quark and the gluon is provided by
quantum chromodynamics (qcd), which is a non-abelian gauge theory with the
gauge group g = su (3) corresponding to three colors. however, neither an iso-
lated quark nor an isolated anti-quark has ever been observed experimentally.
in
the present understanding, they are believed to be conned in hadrons. this is the
hypothesis of quark connement. quark connement could be explained theoreti-
cally within the framework of qcd, although no one has achieved a rigorous proof
of quark connement. this is one of the most important problems to be solved in
theoretical physics.

qcd has a remarkable property, called asymptotic freedom, which was discov-

typeset using ptptex.sty <ver.1.0>

2

ered by gross, wilczek and politzer and independently by t hooft. 3) asymptotic
freedom does not appear in the most successful quantized eld theory, quantum
electrodynamics (qed). as is well known, qed is the abelian gauge theory for the
electron and the photon in which the electromagnetic interaction is described by
the quantized maxwell gauge eld theory with the gauge group g = u (1). asymp-
totic freedom is a consequence of gluon self-interactions. therefore, this is a very
characteristic feature of non-abelian gauge theory.

the purpose of this article is to demonstrate quark connement within qcd
based on the wilson criterion for quark connement, 4) i.e., the area law of the
wilson loop. the wilson loop is a gauge invariant quantity and hence the wilson
criterion is also gauge invariant. the formulation of lattice gauge theory proposed
by wilson 4) is manifestly gauge invariant and does not need the gauge xing. it is
easy to show that the strong coupling expansion in lattice gauge theory leads to the
area law of the wilson loop. however, this result has not yet been continued to the
weak coupling region, where the string tension is expected to obey the scaling law
suggested from the result of the renormalization group based on loop calculations.
the rst indication of the area law of the wilson loop for arbitrary coupling constant
was found in a study based on numerical simulations within the lattice gauge theory
by creutz 5) for g = su (2) and su (3). although the numerical evidence of quark
connement was indeed a great progress toward a complete understanding of quark
connement, the analytical proof is still lacking.

this work was initiated to justify the dual superconductor picture of the qcd
vacuum proposed in the mid-1970s 6) within the framework of continuum quantum
eld theory. for dual superconductivity to occur, magnetic monopoles must be
condensed, just as ordinary superconductivity requires condensation of cooper pairs.
in fact, the importance and the validity of taking into account magnetic monopoles
in quark connement has been demonstrated, at least for simplied four-dimensional
and lower-dimensional models, especially, by polyakov, 7) and recently for the four-
dimensional yang-mills theory and qcd with extended supersymmetries by seiberg
and witten. 8) in this scenario, quark connement is realized due to condensation of
magnetic monopoles. recent developments in numerical simulations on the lattice 9)
conrm the existence of dual superconductivity in qcd, at least, under a specic
gauge xing called the abelian gauge. 10)

this article gives a detailed exposition of the results on quark connement that
were announced in a previous article 11) for g = su (3) together with new results
for g = su (n ) with arbitrary n . they are extensions of the analyses of the
yang-mills theory in the maximal abelian (ma) gauge given in a series of articles,
12), 13), 14), 15), 16), 17) where the case of su (2) was explicitly worked out.
in this
process, we have found that the extension from su (2) to su (3) is non-trivial, but
the extension from su (3) to su (n ), n > 3, is rather straightforward. new features
come out when we begin to analyze the su (n ) case with n  3.
it seems that
they have been overlooked to this time in the conventional approach based on the
maximal abelian gauge.

the ma gauge is a partial gauge xing from the original non-abelian gauge
group g to its subgroup h 10) in which the gauge degrees of freedom of the coset

3

g/h are xed. even after the ma gauge, there is a residual gauge group h which
is taken to be the maximal torus subgroup h = u (1)n 1. after the ma gauge, the
magnetic monopole is expected to appear, since the homotopy group 2(g/h) is
non-trivial, i.e.,

2(su (n )/u (1)n 1) = 1(u (1)n 1) = zn 1.

(1.1)

this implies that the breaking of gauge group g  h by partial gauge xing leads
to (n  1) species of magnetic monopoles. however, we do not necessarily need
to consider the maximal breaking su (n )  u (1)n 1, although the maximal torus
group is desirable as a gauge group of the low-energy eective abelian gauge theory.
12) actually, even if we restrict h to a continuous subgroup of g, there are other
possibilities for choosing h, e.g., we can choose a subgroup h such that

g  h  h := u (1)n 1.

(1.2)

the possible number of cases for choosing h increases as n increases. we have
found 11) that the group h may depend on the representation to which the quark
belongs when n  3 and that it suces to take h = u (n  1) for the fundamental
quark to be conned in the sense of the area law of the wilson loop under the
partial gauge xing. here h is equal to the maximal stability group specied by the
highest-weight state of the representation of the quark in the wilson loop. this is
a new feature which does not show up in the su (2) case. nevertheless, this does
not mean that the choice of the maximal torus does not lead to quark connement.
in fact, even if we choose the maximal torus, the area law can be derived. this is
because the coset g/ h is contained in g/h, i.e., g/ h  g/h, so that the wilson
loop does not feel the whole of g/h, but only feels the components of g/ h that
are contained in g/h. in other words, the variables belonging to g/h  g/ h are
irrelevant for the expectation value of the wilson loop, as can be seen from the non-
abelian stokes theorem (nast) that was presented in ref.11) and is derived in this
article. therefore, a single kind of magnetic monopole is sucient for conning a
fundamental quark, since

2(su (n )/u (n  1)) = 1(u (1)) = z.

(1.3)

our results show that two partial gauge xings su (3)  u (2) and su (3)  u (1)
u (1) lead to the same result for connement as far as the fundamental quarks are
concerned.

the nast plays the crucial role in this article. the nast has a number of
versions which have been derived by many authors. 20) the version of nast derived
in this article is based on the idea of dyakonov and petrov, 21) who derived an su (2)
version and suggested a method of generalization. we derive a version of nast based
on the coherent state representation 22) on the ag space, 23), 24) not on the method
suggested by them. the coherent state representation is used in a dierent fashion to

 the possibility of a discrete subgroup has been extensively investigated recently from the

viewpoint of the abelian gauge, e.g., the center zn for su (n ) (see e.g. ref.18)).

 see ref.19) for a result of the simulation on a lattice.

4

derive an su (2) version of the nast in ref.15), but the extension to su (n ), n  3,
was a non-trivial issue which prevented us from presenting immediate publication
of general su (n ) results. the nast is not only mathematically (or technically)
important but also physically interesting as we now discuss.

first, the nast enables us to write the non-abelian wilson loop,

w c[a] :=

tr(cid:20)p exp(cid:18)igic a(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(1.4)

1
n

in terms of the abelian-eld strength (curvature two-form) f = da with the abelian
gauge potential (connection one-form) a:

w c[a] =z [d(v )]c exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19) =z [d(v )]c exp(cid:18)igzs

f(cid:19) .

(1.5)

 obtained after the hodge decomposition of bi

combining this fact with the abelian-projected eective gauge theory (apegt)
derived by one of the authors, 12) we can explain the abelian dominance 25), 26) in the
wilson loop. the apegt is an abelian gauge theory obtained by integrating out
the massive degrees of freedom, i.e., the o-diagonal gluon gauge eld aa
 with mass
ma. hence, the apegt can be written in terms of the diagonal massless gauge eld
 and the anti-symmetric (abelian) tensor eld bi
ai
 together with the ghost and
anti-ghost elds c a and c a, where the index i denotes the diagonal components and
a the o-diagonal ones. therefore the apegt is regarded as a low-energy eective
theory (leet) which is valid in the long-distance (or low-energy) region r > m1
a .
the abelian gauge eld bi
 can be
identied with the abelian gauge eld dual to ai
. in fact, we can obtain the theory
with an action s[b] written in terms of bi
 alone by integrating out all the elds
other than bi
 in apegt, and the theory can be rewritten into the dual ginzburg-
landau theory, i.e., the dual abelian higgs theory, provided that magnetic monopole
condensation occurs, i.e., hkki 6= 0.
in the dual ginzburg-landau theory, the
coupling constant g in the original theory is replaced by the inverse coupling constant
1/g which is proportional to the magnetic charge. therefore, the dual theory can
be identied with the magnetic theory. on the other hand, the theory with an
action s[a] written in terms of ai alone is an abelian gauge theory, but the scale
dependence of the coupling constant g() is the same as that in the original yang-
mills theory. thus the low-energy eective abelian gauge theory exhibits asymptotic
freedom reproducing the original renormalization-group beta function (g). this is
a manifestation of an approximate weak-strong or electro-magnetic duality between
two low-energy eective theories described by s[a] and s[b].

next, the nast is able to separate the piece  which corresponds to the mag-
netic monopole in the abelian eld a = c + . indeed, we can write the su (n )
version of the t hooft-polyakov tensor describing the magnetic monopole. 27) hence
we can separate the contribution of the magnetic monopole in the area law of the
wilson loop and explain the magnetic monopole dominance in quark connement.
in fact, our derivation of the area law estimates only the monopole contribution,
k = d. moreover, the nast tells us that the essential ingredient in the area
law lies in the geometric phase, which is concerned with the holonomy group of

5

u (n  1). thus we see that quark connement is intimately related to the geometry
of yang-mills gauge theory, in sharp contrast with the conventional wisdom.
we present two methods to derive the area law of the wilson loop by making
use of the nast. the rst method is to use the apegt for estimating the diagonal
wilson loop; for a suciently large wilson loop (|c|  m1
a ), the expectation value
of the non-abelian wilson loop in yang-mills theory is reduced to that of the abelian
wilson loop in apegt:

(cid:28)w c[a](cid:29)y m

=(cid:28) exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)(cid:29)y m (cid:28) exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)(cid:29)ap egt

.

(1.6)

then we can apply the result of ref.14), connement in the abelian gauge theory,
to show quark connement in yang-mills theory.

the second method is to treat the non-abelian gauge theory directly, without
going through the eective abelian gauge theory, based on the novel reformulation of
yang-mills theory in the ma gauge which was proposed by one of the authors. 13) the
novel reformulation regards the yang-mills theory as the perturbative deformation
of a topological quantum eld theory (tqft). an advantage of this reformulation in
the ma gauge is that the derivation of the area law of the non-abelian wilson loop
in the four-dimensional su (n ) yang-mills theory is reduced to that of the diagonal
(abelian) wilson loop in the two-dimensional coset (g/h) non-linear sigma (nls)
model, at least when the wilson loop is planar. therefore the four-dimensional
problem is reduced to a two-dimensional problem. this dimensional reduction is a
remarkable feature of the modied ma gauge  caused by hidden supersymmetry.
the yang-mills coupling constant g of the four-dimensional yang-mills theory is
mapped into the coupling constant in the two-dimensional nls model. hence the
coupling constant is expected to run in the same way as in the original yang-mills
theory, since the perturbative deformation part provides the necessary running, as
is well known from the loop calculation. for the fundamental quark, we are allowed
to restrict the ag space fn 1 := su (n )/u (1)n 1 to the complex projective space
cp n 1 := su (n )/u (n  1). this greatly simplies the actual treatment.
another advantage of this reduction is that the magnetic monopole contribu-
tion to the wilson loop in the four-dimensional yang-mills theory in the ma gauge
is equal to the instanton contribution in the corresponding two-dimensional nls
model. indeed, the diagonal wilson loop can be written as the area integral of the
instanton density k over the area s bounded by the loop c. this correspondence
may shed more light on the strong correlation between magnetic monopoles and
instantons observed in the monte carlo simulations, since the two-dimensional in-
stanton is identied as a subclass of the four-dimensional yang-mills instanton (see
e.g. ref.13)).

in this article the expectation value of the wilson loop is estimated by combining
the instanton calculus and the large n expansion.
(see refs.28), 29), 30), 31) for
reviews of the large n expansion.) we focus on the cp n 1 model corresponding to
the fundamental quark. first, the instanton calculus is performed within the dilute

 we must modify the ma gauge slightly in order to keep the supersymmetry, where the

supersymmetry is expressed by the orthosymplectic group osp(4|2).

6

gas approximation.
it is shown that the calculation in the su (n ) case reduces
to that in the su (2) case. it is well known that the large n expansion is a non-
perturbative technique which can be systematically improved. we derive the area
law to leading order in the large n expansion, namely, in the region of large n
and weak coupling g. we hope that our derivation of quark connement based on
the dimensional reduction and the large n expansion may shed more light on the
relationship between qcd and string theory, as rst suggested by t hooft. 32)

this article is organized as follows.

in the rst half, we give a derivation of
the nast and discuss its implications. sections 2 and 3 are preparations for 
in  2 we review the construct of the coherent state on the ag space for the
4.
general compact semi-simple group g. in  3, we present the explicit form of the
coherent state on the ag space for g = su (n ). we dene the maximal stability
group h, which is very important in the following discussion. in  4, making use
of the results of  2 and 3, we derive a new version of the non-abelian stokes
theorem for g = su (n ). although we discuss only the case of su (n ) explicitly,
it is straightforward to extend this theorem to an arbitrary compact semi-simple
group g. this version of the non-abelian stokes theorem is very interesting not
only from the mathematical but also from the physical point of view, since the non-
abelian wilson loop is expressed as the surface integral of the two-form (i.e., the
generalized t hooft-polyakov tensor), which leads to the magnetic monopole. this
fact is intimately related with the abelian and magnetic monopole dominance in
quark connement, as discussed in subsequent sections.

in the second half, we derive the area law of the wilson loop. in  5 we discuss
the magnetic monopole in su (n ) yang-mills theory. in order to specify the type of
possible magnetic monopoles, it turns out that the maximal stability group is more
important than the maximal torus group h. in  6 abelian dominance in the wilson
loop is shown in the su (n ) yang-mills theory in the maximal abelian gauge based
on the abelian-projected eective gauge theory and the non-abelian stokes theorem.
in  7 we briey review a novel reformulation of the yang-mills theory which has been
proposed by one of the authors 13) to derive quark connement. this reformulation
is called the (perturbative) deformation of the topological quantum eld theory. we
apply this reformulation to derive the area law of the wilson loop in su (n ) yang-
mills theory in  8 and 9. in  9 we show within this reformulation that the area
law of the abelian wilson loop in the two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model for
the ag space g/ h is sucient to derive the area law of the four-dimensional yang-
mills theory in the maximal abelian gauge. at the same time, this derivation leads
to the magnetic monopole dominance in the area law. in  8 we demonstrate the
area law of the wilson loop in the nonlinear sigma model in an approach based on
naive instanton calculus. for the fundamental quark, we have only to deal with the
cp n 1 model. in  9 we derive the area law based on the large n expansion. these
results imply the area law of the non-abelian wilson loop in the four-dimensional
su (n ) yang-mills theory. the nal section contains the conclusion of this article.
in appendix a, we give derivations of the inner product of the coherent states
and the invariant measure on the ag space, which are presented in  3. in appendix
b we explain the method of obtaining cp 1 and cp 2 by gluing the complex planes. in

7

appendix c, we explain two ways to characterize the element of the ag space and the
manner of formulating the nls model using these parameterizations. in appendix
d we summarize the large n expansion of cp n 1. in appendix e supplementary
material on the 1/n expansion is presented.

2. coherent state and maximal stability group

first, we construct the coherent state |, i corresponding to the coset represen-
tatives   g/ h. we follow the method of feng, gilmore and zhang. 22) for inputs,
we prepare the following:
(a) the gauge group g and the lie algebra g of g with the generators {t a}, which

obey the commutation relations

[t a, t b] = if ab

ct c,

(2.1)

c are the structure constants of the lie algebra.

where the f ab
if the lie
algebra is semi-simple, it is more convenient to rewrite the lie algebra in terms
of the cartan basis {hi, e, e}. there are two types of basic operators in
the cartan basis, hi and e. the operators hi may be taken as diagonal, while
e are the o-diagonal shift operators. they obey the commutation relations

[hi, hj] = 0,

[hi, e] = ie,

[e, e] = ihi,

[e, e] =(cid:26) n;e+,

0,

( +   r)
( +  6 r,  +  6= 0)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

where r is the root system, i.e., a set of root vectors {1, , r}, with r the
rank of g.
(b) the hilbert space v  is a carrier (the representation space) of the unitary

irreducible representation   of g.

(c) we use a reference state |i within the hilbert space v , which can be nor-
malized to unity: h|i = 1.
we dene the maximal stability subgroup (isotropy subgroup) h as a subgroup
of g that consists of all the group elements h that leave the reference state |i
invariant up to a phase factor:

h|i = |iei(h), h  h.

(2.6)

 note that any compact semi-simple lie group is a direct product of compact simple lie group.
therefore, it is sucient to consider the case of a compact simple lie group. in the following we
assume that g is a compact simple lie group, i.e., a compact lie group with no closed connected
invariant subgroup.

8

the phase factor is unimportant in the following discussion because we consider the
expectation value of operators in the coherent state. let h be the cartan subgroup
of g, i.e., the maximal commutative semi-simple subgroup in g, and let h be the
cartan subalgebra in g, i.e., the lie algebra for the group h. the maximal stability
subgroup h includes the cartan subgroup h = u (1)r, i.e., h  h.
for every element g  g, there is a unique decomposition of g into a product of
two group elements,

g = h,

  g/ h,

h  h,

for g  g. we can obtain a unique coset space g/ h for a given |i. the action of
arbitrary group element g  g on |i is given by

(2.7)

(2.8)

g|i = h|i = |iei(h).

if  (g) is hermitian, then h 

the coherent state is constructed as |, i = |i. this denition of the coherent
state is in one-to-one correspondence with the coset space g/ h and the coherent
states preserve all the algebraic and topological properties of the coset space g/ h.
 = e. every group element
g  g can be written as the exponential of a complex linear combination of diagonal
operators hi and o-diagonal shift operators e. let |i be the highest-weight
state, i.e., hj|i = j|i, e|i = 0 for   r+, where r+(r) is a subsystem of
positive (negative) roots. then the coherent state is given by 22)

i = hi and e

|, i = |i = exp

(cid:17)
 xr(cid:16)e  e
|i,

  c,

(2.9)

e|i = 0(  r+);

such that the following hold:
(i) |i is annihilated by all the (o-diagonal) shift-up operators e with   r+,
(ii) |i is mapped into itself by all diagonal operators hi, hi|i = i|i;
(iii) |i is annihilated by some shift-down operators e with   r, not by other
and the sum p is restricted to those shift operators e which obey (iii).

e with   r: e|i = 0(some   r); e|i = | + i(some   r);
the coherent states are normalized to unity:
h, |, i = 1.

(2.10)

the coherent state spans the entire space v . however, the coherent states are
non-orthogonal:

h, |, i 6= 0.

(2.11)

by making use of the the group-invariant measure d() of g which is appropriately
normalized, we obtain

z |, id()h, | = i,

(2.12)

which shows that the coherent states are complete, but in fact over-complete. this
resolution of identity is very important to obtain the path integral formula of the
wilson loop given in  4.

the coherent states |, i are in one-to-one correspondence with the coset rep-

resentatives   g/ h:

9

(2.13)

in other words, |, i and   g/ h are topologically equivalent.

|, i  g/ h.

3. flag space and coherent state for su (n )

3.1. su (2) coherent state

in the case of su (2), the maximal stability group agrees with the maximal torus
group u (1) irrespective of the representation. the su (2) case is well known (see,
e.g., ref.15)). the weight and root diagrams are given in fig.1.

note that (1 +|w|2)j is a normalization factor that ensures hj, w|j, wi = 1, which is
obtained from the baker-campbell-hausdor (bch) formulas. the invariant mea-
sure is given by

the complex variable w is a cp 1 variable written as w = ei cot

of the polar coordinate on s2 or euler angles, see ref.13). we introduce the o(3)
vector n as

n1 := sin  cos , n2 := sin  sin , n3 := cos .

indeed, this agrees with (3.7) if w = ( 2

). the entire space of f1 is covered by two

cp 1 = u1  u2, ua = {(1, 2)  cp 1; a 6= 0}.

(3.12)

3.2. su (3) coherent state

for concreteness, we rst focus on the su (3) case. the general su (n ) case
will be discussed in the nal part of this section. the highest weight  of the
representation specied by the dynkin index [m, n] can be written as

~ = m~h1 + n~h2,

where m and n are non-negative integers for the highest weight and h1 and h2 are

if mn = 0, (m = 0 or n = 0), the maximal stability group h is given by h =
u (2) with generators {h1, h2, e, e} (case (i)). such a degenerate case occurs
when the highest-weight vector ~ is orthogonal to some root vectors (see fig.2). if
mn 6= 0 (m 6= 0 and n 6= 0), h is the maximal torus group h = u (1)  u (1) with
generators {h1, h2} (case (ii)). this is a non-degenerate case (see fig.4). therefore,
for the highest weight  in case (i), the coset g/ h is given by

su (3)/u (2) = su (3)/(su (2)  u (1)) = cp 2,

whereas in case (ii),

su (3)/(u (1)  u (1)) = f2.

(3.16)

(3.17)

here, cp n is the complex projective space and fn is the ag space. 23) therefore, the
two fundamental representations belong to case (i), and hence the maximal stability
group is u (2), rather than the maximal torus group u (1)u (1). the implications of
this fact for the mechanism of quark connement is discussed in subsequent sections.

the coherent state for f2 = su (3)/u (1)2 is given by

|, i = (w)|i := v (w)|i,

(3.18)

 this choice of h2 is dierent from that in ref.11) it is adopted so as to obtain the su (3) case

when considering the n = 3 case of su (n ) case studied in the next subsecton.

note that k(w, w) reduces to the kahler potential k(w, w) when w = w, in agree-

the su (n ) case) that the su (3) invariant measure is given (up to a constant factor)

the complex projective space cp 2 is covered by three complex planes c through
holomorphic maps 33) (see appendix b). the parameterization of su (3) in terms of
eight angles is also possible in su (3), just as su (2) is parameterized by three euler
angles (see ref.34)).

14

3.3. su (n ) case

for su (n ) = su (n + 1), the ag space 23) is dened by

fn = su (n + 1)/u (1)n  v.

(3.29)

we use v to denote an element of fn in this denition. fn is a compact kahler
manifold, 35), 36) which is a homogeneous but nonsymmetric manifold of dimension
dimcfn = n(n + 1)/2.

since the ag manifold fn is a kahler manifold, 35), 36) it possesses complex local

coordinates w, a hermitian riemannian metric,

and a corresponding two-form, called the kahler form,

ds2 = g dwd w,

which is closed, i.e.,

k = ig dw  d w,

dk = 0.

(3.30)

(3.31)

(3.32)

any closed form k is locally exact (k = d), due to poincares lemma. the
condition (3.32) is equivalent to

g 
w =

g 
w ,

or

g 
 w =

g
 w .

(3.33)

this holds if and only if the metric g can be obtained from a real scalar function
k as

g  =



w


 w k,

k = i k.

(3.34)

(3.35)

where k = k(w, w) is called the kahler potential. then the kahler two-form is
obtained from (3.31) as

on the ag space, there transitively act two groups, g = su (n + 1) and its
complexication gc = sl(n + 1, c). any element of fn can be written as an upper
triangular (n + 1) (n + 1) matrix, whose main diagonal elements are all 1 and whose
upper n(n + 1)/2 elements are complex numbers, w  c:

 fn.

(3.36)

 the imaginary unit i is needed to make the kahler two-form real, since g  = g  = g .

therefore, we can write

fn = sl(n + 1, c)/b  ,

15

(3.37)

where b(b+) is the borel subgroup, i.e., the group of lower (upper) triangular
matrices with determinant equal to 1 (iwasawa decomposition). this denition
(3.37)  should be compared with the rst denition (3.29). the mapping g/h 
gc/b is a generalization of the stereographic projection in the g = su (2) case. 13)
the action of the group sl(n + 1, c) on fn, g : v  vg can be found through the
gauss decomposition,

v  g = t dvg,

g  sl(n + 1, c),

t  z(n + 1),

vg  z+(n + 1),

(3.38)

where z+(n + 1)(z(n + 1)) is the set of upper (lower) triangular matrices whose
main diagonal elements are all 1 and d is a diagonal matrix with determinant equal
to 1. the elements of the factors t, d and vg are rational functions of the elements
of g.

the group g = su (n ) has rank n1, and the cartan subalgebra is constructed
from (n  1) diagonal generators hi. hence, there are n (n  1) o-diagonal shift
operators e, since dimsu (n ) := n 2 1 = (n  1)+ n (n  1). therefore, the total
number of roots is n (n  1), of which there are n  1 simple roots. other roots
are constructed as linear combination of the simple roots. also, there are n weight
vectors. an element of su (n ) is represented by the n  n unitary matrices with
determinant 1 that are generated by traceless hermitian matrices, n 2  1 linearly
independent generators t a(a = 1, , n 2  1). the generators are normalized as

tr(t at b) =

1
2

ab.

(3.40)

each o-diagonal generator e has a single non-zero element 1/2. the diagonal
generator hm is dened by

(hm)ab =

m

akbk  ma,m+1b,m+1)

(3.41)

(3.42)

for m = 1 to n1, the rst m diagonal elements (beginning from the upper left-hand
corner) of hm are 1, the next one is m, and the rest of the diagonal elements are
0. thus hm is traceless. the weight vectors (eigenvectors of all hi: hj|i = j|i)

last non-zero component is positive. with this denition, the weights satisfy

this fact is usually expressed by a dynkin diagram (see fig.5).

fig. 5. the dynkin diagram of su (n ).

if we choose 1 as the highest-weight ~ of the fundamental representation n,
some of the roots are orthogonal to 1. from the above construction, it is easy to see
that only one simple root 1 is not-orthogonal to 1, and that all the other simple
roots are orthogonal:

1  1 6= 0,

1  2 = 1  3 =  = 1  n 1 = 0.

(3.50)

therefore, all the linear combinations constructed from 2, , n 1 are also orthog-
onal to 1. non-orthogonal roots are obtained only when 1 is included in the linear
combinations. it is not dicult to show that the total number of non-orthogonal
roots is 2(n  1), and hence there are n (n  1) 2(n  1) = (n  2)(n  1) orthog-
onal roots. the (n  2)(n  1) shift operators e corresponding to these orthogonal
roots together with the n  1 cartan subalgebra hi constitute the maximal stability
subgroup h = u (n  1), since (n  2)(n  1) + (n  1) = (n  1)2 = dimu (n  1).
thus, for the fundamental representation, the stability subgroup h of su (n ) is
given by h = u (n  1). in order to describe the coset space g/ h, we need only
(n  1) complex numbers, since

g/ h = su (n )/u (n  1),

(3.51)

and dimg/ h = 2(n  1). we conclude that g/ h = cp n 1, where cp n 1 is the
(n  1)-dimensional complex projective space, 35), 36), 33), 38) which is a submanifold
of the ag manifold fn 1.
the complex projective space cp n is the compact kahler symmetric space with
dimccp n = n. the su (n + 1) group can act transitively on this manifold, and this
manifold can be considered as a factor space:

cp n = su (n + 1)/(su (n)  u (1)).

the kahler potential of fn (n = n  1) is obtained as follows. let h be the
hermitian matrix dened by h = v v , v  fn. consider the gauss decomposition

h = v v  = t dv,

(3.54)

where t  z(n + 1) and d is a diagonal matrix with determinant equal to 1. h
has the upper principal minors (v v )( = 1, , n + 1), which are equal to the
following products of the elements  of the diagonal matrix d = diag(1, , n):
(3.55)

1 = 1, 2 = 12,

 , n = 12  n, n+1 = 1.

let d ( = 1, , n) be the dynkin index of su (n + 1). then the kahler potential
of fn is given in the form,

k(w, w) =

n

dk(w, w) =

x=1

((w, w))d# .
d ln (w, w) = ln" n

the above construction of the coherent state can be extended to an arbitrary

compact semi-simple lie group (see chapter 11 of perelomov 40)).

4. non-abelian stokes theorem

in this section we derive a new version of the non-abelian stokes theorem
(nast) based on the coherent state obtained in the previous section. an advantage
of this version of nast is that it is possible to separate the magnetic monopole
contribution in the wilson loop and that it is very helpful to understand the dual
superconductor picture of quark connement in qcd.

4.1. non-abelian stokes theorem for su (n )

we consider the innitesimal deviation  =  + d (which is sucient to derive

the path integral formula). from (3.19),

|, i = |i = e 1

2 k(w, w) exp"x

(w)e#|i,

we nd

h + d, |, i = exp[i + o((dw)2)],
(x) := h|i(x)d(x)|i,

where d denotes the exterior derivative

d := dx 

x := dx.

then  is the one-form

 = dx,  = h|i(x)(x)|i.

(4.1)

(4.2)
(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

here the x dependence of  comes from that of w(x) (the local eld variable w(x)),
i.e., (x) = (w(x)).

20

the exterior derivative is regarded as the operator

d =  +  = dw

(4.6)

where the operators  and  are called the dolbeault operators. 35) from the inner
product (3.22),

h, |, i = ek(w, w)e 1

2 [k(w, w)+k(w, w)],

we obtain another expression for  using the kahler potential k:

(4.7)

(4.8)

the wilson loop operator w c[a] is dened as the trace of the path-ordered

exponent along the closed loop c as

w c[a] :=

tr(cid:20)p exp(cid:18)igic a(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

n

(4.9)

where n is the dimension of the representation (n = dim(1r) = tr(1r)), and a is
the (lie-algebra valued) connection one-form

a(x) = aa

 (x)t adx = aa(x)t a.

(4.10)

consider a curve starting from x0 and ending at x. we parameterize this curve by
the parameter t and dene

wab(t, t0) :="p exp igz x(t)

x0(t0)

dxa(x)!#ab

=(cid:20)p exp(cid:18)igz t

where

then the wavefunction dened by

(4.11)

note that the wilson loop operator is obtained by taking the trace of (4.11) for the
closed loop, say c:

w c[a] =

tr(w (t, 0)) =

dimofrep

xa=1

waa(t, 0).

(4.15)

this implies 21) that it is possible to write the path integral representation of the
wilson loop operator if we identify a(t) with the hamiltonian as

h(t) = ga(t) = ga(x)dx/dt.

(4.16)

21

first, we dene the path-ordered exponent by discretizing the time interval t into
n innitesimal steps and subsequently taking the limit n  ,   0 with n  = t

the trace with

(  )k = i k,

(4.31)

since the identity d2 = 0 leads to 2 = 0 = 2,   +  = 0. therefore, the second

potential of the ag manifold.

the berry-aharonov-anandan phase for the residual u (1) invariance. the details of
this point will be given in a subsequent article. 42)

4.2. fundamental representation of su (n ) and cp n 1 variable

dening

we can write

a(x) := (v (x)|i)a,

(a = 1, , n )

na(x) := h|v (x)t av (x)|i = a(x)(t a)abb(x).

(4.33)

(4.34)

in the cp n 1 case, in particular, the highest-weight state is given by a column
vector,

|i =


1
0
...
0

,




and then we can write

na(x) := h|u (x)t au (x)|i = a(x)(t a)abb(x),

where u  su (n ) and

then na(x) can be rewritten as

a(x) := (u (x)|i)a = u1a(x).

na(x) = (u (x)t au (x))11.

note that the cp n 1 variables a(a = 1, , n ) are subject to the constraint

now, we examine another expression (the adjoint orbit representation),

or equivalently,

na(x) = 2tr(u (x)hu (x)t a),

n(x) := na(x)t a = u (x)hu (x).

(4.44)

note that two elements agree with each other. hence the adjoint orbit cannot cover
all the ag space f2. this is the cp 2 case. it is easy to see that the two denitions
(4.36) and (4.40) are equivalent,

na(x) = (u (x)t au (x))11 = 2tr(hu (x)t au (x)),

(4.45)

since u t au  is traceless.

the correspondence between the fn 1 variables wa and the cp n 1 variables

a is given, e.g., by

1 = w1, 2 = w2,

 , n 1 = wn 1, n = 1.

(4.46)

thus  is an inhomogeneous coordinate, a = a/n = wa (a = 1, , n  1), by
denition. in the cp n 1 case (for the fundamental representation), we can perform
the replacement

if f (v ) belongs to the lie algebra of g (and hence f (v ) is traceless, i.e., trf (v ) = 0).
thus, we obtain another expression for ,

h|f (v )|i = 2tr[hf (u )]

(4.47)

(x) := 2tr[hiu (x)du (x)] = i2tr[hdu (x)u (x)],

which is a diagonal piece of the maurer-cartan one-form,

 := du u 1.

it turns out that the two-form k is the symplectic two-form,
k = d = 2tr(h[u 1du, u 1du ]) = 2tr(n[dn, dn]).

(4.48)

(4.49)

(4.50)

our choice of h is the most economical one (see ref.44) for dierent choices and
more discussion of the related issues).

 when [m, n] = [1, 1], on the other hand, h = diag(1, 1, 0), and all the diagonal elements are

dierent. therefore n(x) moves on the whole ag space, f2.

from the kahler potential of cp n 1 (3.61) and the relation (4.8), the connection

one-form  reads

up to the total derivative. by taking the exterior derivative, we obtain

which agrees with the metric (3.63).

4.3. an implication of the nast

(4.51)

(4.52)

(4.53)

the nast (4.27) implies that the wilson loop operator is given by

w c[a] =z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19) =z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igzs:c=s

f(cid:19) .(4.54)

first, a is the connection one-form

a := naaa +

1
g

 = h|av |i,

where av is obtained as the gauge transformation of a by v  fn 1:

av := v av  +

i
g

v dv  = a +

i
g

d.

for a quark in the fundamental representation, we can write

a = 2tr(hav ).

(4.55)

(4.56)

(4.57)

therefore, the one-form a is equal to the diagonal piece of the gauge-transformed
potential av . this fact is very useful to derive the abelian dominance in the low-
energy physics of qcd (see  6).

next, f is the curvature two-form,

f := da = dc +

1
g

d = dc +

1
g

k ,

where we have dened the one-form

c := naaa.

(4.58)

(4.59)

the anti-symmetric tensor f can be called the generalized t hooft-polyakov tensor
for the following reasons: (1) it gives a non-vanishing magnetic monopole (current),

26

where only the second term k gives a non-trivial contribution; (2) it is invariant
under the full gauge transformation, although it is an abelian eld strength. these
facts are demonstrated as follows.

first, we characterize the ag space in complex coordinates. more precisely,
the target space at each space-time point x  rd is parameterized by the complex
variables, w = w(x). the kahler two-form is rewritten as

k = ig  w wdx  dx.

on the other hand,

k := d =

1
2

(   )dx  dx :=

g
2

f 
dx  dx.

then the second piece g1k of f can be written as

f 
 =

1
g

(  ) =

i
g

g w w,

and hence

f = c   c + f 
.

(4.60)

(4.61)

(4.62)

(4.63)

the magnetic monopole current k is obtained as the divergence of the dual tensor
f 
 :

k := 

f ,

(4.64)

(4.65)

where the hodge dual of f in four dimensions is dened by

f :=

1
2

f.

the rst piece dc in f does not contribute to the magnetic current, due to the
bianchi identity. on the other hand, the second term k in f can lead to a non-
vanishing magnetic current, as shown shortly. here it should be remarked that the
expression for k given in terms of the local coordinate w leads to a vanishing
magnetic current. in fact, if the metric is given by the kahler potential we have

k =

where we have used the antisymmetric property of  under the exchange of 
and , and  and . however, this does not imply the vanishing total magnetic ux
or magnetic charge.

27

we recall that this situation is similar to that of the wu-yang monopole 46) com-
pared with the original dirac monopole. 45) there are two ways to describe the dirac
magnetic monopole. one is to use a single vector potential with (line) singularities,
called the dirac string, where the singularities are distributed on a semi-innite line
going through the origin of the space coordinates. in the absence of singularities,
the vector potential gives a vanishing magnetic charge, due to the bianchi identity,

 =i b  ds =i curla  ds =zd3

divcurladv = 0.

(4.67)

therefore, the singularities must produce a magnetic charge which has the same
magnitude as the magnetic charge at the origin, but opposite sign. another way
is to introduce more than one vector potential to avoid singularities. each vector
potential a is dened in a sub-region u of the sphere s2 such that a is regular in
each region u and the union of the sub-regions covers the whole sphere. thus, the
bianchi identity leads to zero magnetic ux in each sub-region. note that we can not
apply the gauss theorem divcurla = 0, since u is not a closed surface. the total
magnetic ux is recovered by summing up all the contributions of the dierences of
vector potentials on the boundary b, between two regions u and u are

 =x iu

curla  ds =x,ib,

(a  a)d,

(4.68)

where the minus sign follows from the fact that the orientation of the boundary is
opposite for neighboring regions. the dierence is given by the gauge transformation,
a  a = ,. this recovers the same magnetic ux as in the former case.
the variable w corresponds to a in the case of the wu-yang monopole. there-
fore, to show the existence of a non-zero magnetic ux, we must specify the method
of gluing dierent coordinate patches on the boundary. these subtleties are avoided
by using a dierent parameterization. this generalizes the argument given by t
hooft and polyakov for the su (2) magnetic monopole. the antisymmetric tensor
f given by (4.58) is the su (n ) generalization of the t hooft-polyakov tensor for
su (2). in the su (2) case, a = 2tr(t 3av ) for any representation, and the two-form
f := da is the abelian eld strength, which is invariant under the su (2) transfor-
mation. hence the two-form f is identically the t hooft-polyakov tensor,

f (x) := (na(x)aa
describing the magnetic ux emanating from the magnetic monopole, if we identify
na with the direction of the higgs eld:

n(x) (n(x)  n(x)), (4.69)

 (x))  (na(x)aa

 (x))

the complex coordinate representation reads

a := a/||,

|| :=qaa.

f 
(x) =

g

1

(1 + |w(x)|2)2 w(x) w(x).

(4.70)

(4.71)

28

in general, the (curvature) two-form f = d(naaa) + k in the nast is the
abelian eld strength, which is invariant under the full non-abelian gauge transfor-
mation of g = su (n ):

 (x))  (na(x)aa

f(x) := (na(x)aa
the invariance of f is obvious from the nast (4.54), since w c[a] is gauge invariant
and the measure [d()]c is also invariant under the g gauge transformation. in the
case of the fundamental representation, the invariance is easily seen, because it is
possible to rewrite (4.58) or (4.75) into the manifestly gauge-invariant form

n(x)  [n(x),  n(x)]. (4.75)

where we have used (4.50) in the last step. here q is the integer-valued instanton

the contribution from the magnetic monopole is replaced by the instanton in the
two-dimensional nls model. the magnetic charge satises the dirac quantization
condition,

gmg = 2q = 2n.

up to the total derivative. hence, we obtain

k = d = im(1)2[(1 + |w1|2)dw2  d w2  w2w1dw2  d w1

+(1 + |w3|2)(dw2  w3dw1)(d w2  w3d w1)].

(4.83)

the kahler potential for f2 is given by

for cp 2, it reads

k(w, w) = ln[(1)m(2)n].

k(w, w) = ln[(1)m],

(4.84)

(4.85)

which is obtained as a special case of f2 by setting w3 = 0 and n = 0. hence, we
obtain

 = im

w1d w1 + w2d w2

1(w, w)

,

up to the total derivative, and

k = d = im(1)2[(1 + |w1|2)dw2  d w2  w2w1dw2  d w1

w2 w1dw1  d w2 + (1 + |w2|2)dw1  d w1].

this should be compared with the case f1 = cp 1,

k(w, w) = m ln[(1 + |w|2)], m = 2j.

for su (2), we reproduce the well-known results,

and

(4.90)

the explicit form of k is necessary to carry out the instanton calculus in the
following.

5. magnetic monopole in su(n) yang-mills theory

in the dual superconductor picture of quark connement, the magnetic monopoles
give the dominant contribution to the area law of the wilson loop or the string ten-
sion. following the t hooft argument, 10) the partial gauge xing g  h realizes the
magnetic monopole in yang-mills gauge theory, even in the absence of an elementary
scalar eld. in the conventional approach based on the ma gauge, the residual gauge
group was chosen to be the maximal torus subgroup h = u (1)n 1 for g = su (n ).
this choice immediately determines the type of magnetic monopoles. we now re-
examine this issue.

we have learned that the magnetic monopole which is responsible for the area
law of the wilson loop is determined by the maximal stability group h rather than
the residual gauge group h. this is a new feature that appears in su (n ) for n  3.
it seems that this possibility has been overlooked in the lattice community, as far as
we know. indeed, this situation occurs only for su (n ) with n  3. therefore, we
must distinguish the maximal stability group h from the residual gauge group h. in
general, the maximal stability group h is larger than the maximal torus subgroup:
h = u (1)n 1  h. hence, the coset space is smaller than in the maximal torus
case, i.e., g/ h  g/h.
the existence of magnetic monopoles is suggested by the non-trivial homotopy
groups 2(g/h). in case (ii), we have

2(f2) = 2(su (3)/(u (1)  u (1))) = 1(u (1)  u (1)) = z + z.

(5.1)

on the other hand, in case (i), i.e., [m,0] or [0,n], we have

2(cp 2) = 2(su (3)/u (2)) = 1(u (2)) = 1(su (2)  u (1)) = 1(u (1)) = z.
(5.2)

note that the cp n 1 model possesses only local u (1) invariance for any n  2. it is
this u (1) invariance that corresponds to a single kind of abelian magnetic monopole
appearing in case (i). this magnetic monopole may be related to the non-abelian
magnetic monopole proposed by weinberg et al. 48) the explicit solution for the
magnetic monopole in su (3) gauge theories are discussed in ref.49).

this situation should be compared with the su (2) case, where the maximal
stability group is always given by the maximal torus h = u (1), irrespective of the
representation. therefore, the coset is given by

and

g/h = su (2)/u (1) = f1 = cp 1 = s2

2(su (2)/u (1)) = 2(f1) = 2(cp 1) = z,

(5.3)

(5.4)

for arbitrary representation.

31

for su (n ), our results suggest that the fundamental quarks are to be conned

when the maximal stability group h is given by h = u (n  1) and
2(g/ h ) = 2(su (n )/u (n  1)) = 2(cp n 1) = z,

while the adjoint quark is related to the maximal torus h = u (1)n 1 and

(5.5)

2(g/h) = 2(su (n )/u (1)n 1) = 2(fn 1) = zn 1.

(5.6)

this observation is in sharp contrast with the conventional treatment, in which the
(n  1) species of magnetic monopoles corresponding to the residual maximal torus
group u (1)n 1 of g = su (n ) are taken into account on equal footing. in fact, the
nast derived in this article shows that the fundamental quark feels only the u (1)
that is embedded in the maximal stability group u (n  1) as a magnetic monopole.
this is a component along the highest weight.

6. abelian dominance in su (n ) gauge theory

6.1. apegt as a low-energy eective theory

the abelian dominance in su (n ) yang-mills theory can be explained as follows.
first, we adopt the maximal abelian (ma) gauge. the ma gauge for su (n ) is
dened as follows. consider the cartan decomposition of a into diagonal (h) and
o-diagonal (g/h) pieces,

a(x) = aa(x)t a = ai(x)h i + aa(x)t a,

(a = 1, , n 2  1).

(6.1)

in particular, for g = su (3),

h 1 =

3
2

, h 2 =

8
2

, t a =

a
2

. (a = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7)

(6.2)

the ma gauge is obtained by minimizing the functional of o-diagonal elds,

r :=z d4x

1
2

aa

(x)aa(x) :=z d4xtrg/h (a(x)a(x)),

(6.3)

under the gauge transformation. under the innitesimal gauge transformation , r
transforms as

r =z d4xaaaa



=z d4xaa(a + gf aijai
= z d4x(aa + gf aibai

ab)a,

j + gf aibai

b + gf abc ab

c)

(6.4)

since f abc is completely antisymmetric in the indices and f aij = 0 (t i and t j
commute). therefore, the condition r = 0 for arbitrary  leads to the dierential
ma gauge given by

aa(x)  gf abiai

(x)ab(x) := (d[a]a)a = 0.

(6.5)

32

the su (n ) yang-mills theory in the ma gauge is given by

stotal

y m = sy m + sgf +f p ,

sy m =z d4x1
4 f a

f  a,

sgf +f p = z d4xib(cid:20) c a(cid:18)d[a]a +


2

b(cid:19)a(cid:21) ,

where b is the becchi-rouet-stora-tyupin (brst) transformation,
ba(x) = d[a]c(x) := c(x)  ig[a(x), c(x)],
bc(x) = i
b c(x) = ib(x),
bb(x) = 0,

g[c(x), c(x)],

1
2

which is nilpotent, i.e., 2

b  0. the generating functional is given by

zy m [j] =z [da][dc][d c][db] exp(istotal

y m + isj ).

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

(6.9)

(6.10)

now we proceed to derive the eective abelian gauge theory in the ma gauge by
integrating out the o-diagonal gauge elds (together with the ghost and anti-ghost
elds), aa, c a, c a and ba, as done in refs.50), 12). then the su (n ) yang-mills
theory can be reduced to the u (1)n 1 abelian gauge theory, which is written in
terms of the diagonal elds, ai, c i, c i and bi, alone:

where

zy m [j] =z [dai][dc i][d c i][dbi] exp(istotal
ap egt + i sj ) =z [daa][dc a][d c a][dba] exp(istotal

ap egt + i sj ),

exp(istotal

(6.11)

y m + isj ). (6.12)

in particular, the partition function reads

zy m [0] =z [dai][dc i][d c i][dbi] exp(istotal

ap egt ) := zap egt .

(6.13)

the abelian gauge theory obtained in this way is called the abelian-projected ef-
fective gauge theory (apegt). it has been shown that the apegt is an abelian
gauge theory whose gauge coupling constant g runs according to the same renormalization-
group beta function as in the original su (n ) yang-mills theory,

(6.18)

6.2. modied ma gauge

in the ma gauge, it is expected 25) that the o-diagonal gauge elds aa

 have
non-zero mass ma(ma 6= 0), whereas the diagonal gauge elds ai
 remain massless
(ma = 0). therefore, the apegt obtained in this way can be regarded as the
low-energy eective gauge theory of yang-mills theory. in the framework of lattice
gauge theory, this prediction was conrmed in numerical calculations by amemiya
and suganuma 52) for g = su (2) and su (3). in the framework of the continuum
gauge eld theory, on the other hand, it is more ecient to modify the ma gauge
into the osp(d|2) invariant form by making use of the brst b and anti-brst
b transformations, as proposed by one of the authors: 13)

ic c(cid:21) ,

(6.19)

where  corresponds to the gauge xing parameter. note that (6.19) is obtained from
(6.8) by adding the ghost self-interaction terms and by adjusting the parameter for
the ghost self-interaction term, since

(6.20)

the special case  = 2 is discussed in previous articles. 13), 15) for g = su (2), the
last two terms reduce to 2i c 1 c 2c 3 = 2c 3 c + c  in agreement with the previous
result 13) (see ref.13) for details).
in the modied ma gauge (6.19), the non-zero mass generation of o-diagonal
components was demonstrated analytically (at least in the topological sector), using
dimensional reduction to the two-dimensional coset non-linear (nls) sigma model
(see section iv.c of ref.13)). quite recently, dynamical mass generation of the o-
diagonal gluons has been shown to take place due to ghostanti-ghost condensation
caused by the attractive quartic ghost interaction (contained in the gauge xing term
of the modied ma gauge), which is necessary to maintain renormalizability in four
dimensions. the o-diagonal gluon mass obtained in this way can be written in terms

 see ref.12) for details. the result of ref.50), 12) for su (2) can be generalized to su (n ) in
straightforward way, at least at the one-loop level 51). at the two-loop level, this is not trivial. the
two-loop result will be given in ref.51).

34

of the intrinsic scale of the gluodynamics, qcd, and hence it is a renormalization-
group invariant quanity.
(for more details, see ref.42).) therefore, integration
of the massive o-diagonal gauge elds is interpreted as a step of the wilsonian
renormalization group, and the apegt can describe low-energy physics on the
length scale r > m1
a . in this sense, the apegt can be regarded as the low-energy
eective gauge theory of yang-mills theory.

6.3. abelian dominance

with the nast for su (n ) just derived, abelian dominance in su (n ) yang-
mills theory is explained as follows, in a manner based on the same argument as
that in the su (2) case.

the nast (4.27) implies that the expectation value of the wilson loop in the

su (n ) yang-mills theory is given by

hw c[a]iy m =z [d(v )]c(cid:28) exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)(cid:29)y m

,

where the one-form a is written as

a = dxa = 2tr(hav )

(6.21)

(6.22)

for a quark in the fundamental representation. thus, the one-form a is equal to the
diagonal piece of the gauge-transformed potential av , i.e., a component along the
highest-weight vector of the fundamental representation of su (n ). by applying
the above result (6.18) to (6.21), we obtain

(cid:28)w c[a](cid:29)y m

= z 1

= (cid:28) exp(cid:18)igic
= (cid:28) exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)(cid:29)y m
a(cid:19)(cid:29)ap egt
ap egt z [dai][dc i][d c i][dbi] exp(istotal

ap egt [ai]) exp(cid:18)igic

(6.23)

(6.24)

a(cid:19) , (6.25)

where we have used in the rst equality the fact that the the integration over v is
redundant after having taken the expectation value hiy m . this implies the abelian
dominance for the large wilson loop in su (n ) gauge theory in the sense that the

 rigorously speaking, all high-energy modes should be integrated out in the wilsonian renor-
malization group. hence, we must integrate out the high-energy mode of the diagonal elds, ai
,
too. the result is the same as the above, at least at the one-loop level. at the two-loop level, we
must be more careful in dealing with the high-energy mode (see ref.51)).

 abelian dominance in the low-energy region of su (2) qcd is demonstrated in ref.15) using
the result in ref.12) combined with the su (2) nast. 21), 15) the monopole dominance is derived
for su (2) in ref.15) by showing that the dominant contribution to the area law comes from the
monopole piece alone, k = d = tr(n[dn, dn]).

 therefore, the component a along the highest-weight is obtained as an appropriate linear
combination of ai. other components orthogonal to the highest-weight do not contribute to the
expectation value of the wilson loop, since the apegt (6.14) is an abelian gauge theory without
self-interaction among the gauge elds.

35

expectation value of the non-abelian wilson loop in yang-mills theory is nearly
equal to (or dominated by) that of the abelian wilson loop in the apegt, where
the wilson loop c is so large that the apegt is valid in that region, i.e., r, t > m1
a
for a rectangular wilson loop with sides r and t . the apegt is valid in the range
qcd <   r1 < ma.
6.4. monopole dominance and the area law

in our framework, the abelian dominance and the monopole dominance are

understood as implying the rst and the second relations below, respectively:

(cid:28)w c[a](cid:29)y m

=(cid:28) exp(cid:18)igic
=(cid:28) exp(cid:18)iic

a(cid:19)(cid:29)ap egt
(cid:19)(cid:29)ap egt

.

(6.26)

(6.27)

numerical simulations show that the monopole part obeys the area law and abel
exhausts the full string tension obtained from the non-abelian wilson loop (i.e.,
monopole dominance in the string tension or area law),

(cid:28) exp(cid:18)iic

(cid:19)(cid:29)ap egt  exp(abel|s|),

(6.28)

while hexp (ighc a  ihc )iap egt does not obeys the area law. this result implies

the area law of the original non-abelian wilson loop,

(cid:28)w c[a](cid:29)y m  exp(|s|)  = abel.

(6.29)

in ref.16), the monopole dominance and the area law of the wilson loop have
been demonstrated using the apegt for g = su (2). now this scenario can be
extended to g = su (n ). the important remarks are in order.

1. the apegt has a running coupling constant which increases as the relevant
energy decreases (asymptotic freedom), and thus the apegt is in the strong
coupling region in the low-energy regime (see fig.6).

2. the abelian gauge group in apegt is a compact group embedded in the
compact non-abelian gauge group su (n ). it is the compactness that causes
the phase transition in the apegt at c = 
4 , which separates the coulomb
(conformal) phase ( < c) from the strong coupling phase ( > c). this
follows from the berezinski-kosterlitz-thouless (bkt) phase transition in the
two-dimensional o(2) nls model obtained through dimensional reduction.

3. in the low-energy region such that () > c, the apegt is in the strong
coupling phase which connes the quark due to vortex condensation. the above
described strategy is schematically depicted below.

7. reformulation of yang-mills theory

in this section we summarize the novel reformulation of the yang-mills the-
ory proposed in ref.13) and elaborated in ref.17). this material is necessary for
subsequent sections.

7.1. deformation of topological eld theory

we consider the quantization of yang-mills theory on the topological background

eld. we decompose the connection a as

a(x) = (x) + q(x)

(7.1)

and identify q with the quantum uctuation eld on the background eld . for
arbitrary but xed background eld , the generating functional is given by

z[j, ] :=z [dq][d c][d c][d b] exp{isy m [ + q]

+i sgf [q, c, c, b] + i(j  q)},

(7.2)

a
m
where sy m [a] is the usual yang-mills action,
sy m [a] = z ddx
1
4f a

 [a]f  a[a],

37

(7.3)

and sgf is the gauge-xing and fp ghost term for the quantum uctuation eld q:

(7.4)

sgf [q, c, c, b] := z ddx ib trg(cid:20) c(cid:18) f [q] +


2

b(cid:19)(cid:21) .

we wish to retain gauge invariance for the background eld  even after the gauge
xing for q. this is realized by choosing the background eld (bgf) gauge xing
condition

f a[q] := dab

 []qb = 0.

(7.5)

in fact, in the bgf gauge, z[j, ] is invariant under the gauge transformation of
the background eld; the innitesimal version is given by  = d[]. hence, the
theory with the action

sef f [j, ] := i ln z[j, ],

(7.6)

is dened only on the space of the gauge orbit. suppose that the background eld
satises the equation f a[] = 0. in order to consider the quantized yang-mills
theory on all possible background elds satisfying the equations f a[] = 0, we
dene the total generating functional

z[j] =z [d][dc][d c][db] z[j, ] exp(ist qf t [, c, c, b]) exp[i(j  )]
=z [d][dc][d c][db] exp{i sef f [j, ] + ist qf t [, c, c, b] + i(j  )},(7.7)

where st qf t [, c, c, b] corresponds to the gauge-xing term for the background
eld . in order to describe the magnetic monopole as a topological background
eld in yang-mills theory, we choose the ma gauge for ,

st qf t [, c, c, b] := z ddx ib trg/h(cid:20) c(cid:18)f [] +


2

b(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(7.8)

where

f a[] := d

ab[i]b := (ab  gf abi

i)b

(i = 1, , n  1).(7.9)

note that the trace is taken on the coset g/h, not on the entire g, in the ma gauge.

under the identication

(x) :=

i
g

u (x)u (x), q(x) := u (x)v(x)u (x),

(7.10)

we assume that all the topologically non-trivial congurations come from , whereas
v denotes topologically trivial congurations. therefore, v changes under the small

38

gauge transformation, while  includes the eect of large gauge transformations.
therefore, we must take into account the nite gauge rotation u , without restriction
to the innitesimal gauge transformation. under the identication (7.10), the yang-
mills action is invariant,

sy m [a] = sy m [ + q] = sy m [v] =z ddx1
4 f a

 [v]f  a[v],

(7.11)

while the gauge-xing term (7.4) is changed 17) into

sgf [v, , , ] := z ddx ib trg(cid:20)(cid:18)v +


2

(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(7.12)

this implies that the background gauge for q is changed into the lorentz gauge for
v, v = 0. then the generating functional in the background eld  is cast into
z[j, ] =z [dv][d][d][d] expnisy m [v] + i sgf [v, , , ] + i(j  uv u )o ,
where v, ,  and  are dened by the adjoint rotations of q, c, c and b respec-

(7.13)

tively:

v := u qu,

 := u  cu,

 := u  cu,

 := u  bu.

(7.14)

thus the total generating functional reads

z[j] =z [du ][dc][d c][db] z[j, ] exp(isgf [, c, c, b]) exp[i(j  )]
=z [du ][dc][d c][db] exp{i sef f [j, ] + ist qf t [, c, c, b] + i(j  )},

(7.15)

where we have made a change of variable from  to u . the measure [du ] is invariant
under the multiplication

u (x)  u (x)u (x),

which leads to the nite gauge transformation of the background eld,

(x)  u (x)(x) u (x) +

i
g

u (x)d u (x).

(7.16)

(7.17)

the modied ma gauge proposed in ref. 13) leads to the tqft with the action

st qf t [, c, c, b] :=zrd

ddx ib btrg/h(cid:20) 1

2

 


2

ic c(cid:21) .

(7.18)

the expectation value of the functional f (a) of a is calculated as follows. if
the functional is of the form f (a) = g(v, u )h(u ), then the expectation value is
calculated according to

hf (a)iy m = hhg(v, u )iv

py m h(u )iu

t qf t ,

(7.19)

 see remark 10.1.

where the sector of the perturbative deformation is dened by

39

h()iv

py m = z 1

py mz [dv][d][d][d] expnisy m [v] + i sgf [v, , , ]o (),

and the sector topological eld theory is dened by

zpy m :=z [dv][d][d][d] expnisy m [v] + i sgf [v, , , ]o ,
h()iu

t qf t z [du ][dc][d c][db] exp{ist qf t [, c, c, b]}(),

t qf t := z 1

(7.20)

zt qf t :=z [du ][dc][d c][db] exp{ist qf t [, c, c, b]}.

(7.21)

this reformulation of the yang-mills theory is called the perturbative deformation
of a topological quantum eld theory. the expectation value h()iv
py m for the
eld v is calculated using a perturbation theory in terms of the coupling constant
g. on the other hand, the expectation value h()iu
t qf t should be calculated in a
non-perturbative way to incorporate the topological contribution. here u is a com-
pact gauge variable corresponding to a nite gauge transformation. in the instanton
calculus, the integration measure [du ] is replaced with the (nite-dimensional) inte-
gration over the collective coordinates of the instanton.

7.2. dimensional reduction to the nls model in the ma gauge

it has been shown 13) that, due to the hidden supersymmetry osp(d|2), the
tqft part (7.18) is reduced to the (d  2)-dimensional coset (g/h) nonlinear
sigma (nls) model,

sn lsm [u, c, c] := zrd2

dd2x trg/h(cid:20) 1

2

 


2

ic c(cid:21) ,

(7.22)

where, for the matrix element ab (see appendix c),

trg/h(cid:20) 1

2

(x)(x)(cid:21) = xa,b:a<b

((x))ab((x))ab.

(7.23)

by making use of the complex coordinates in the ag space g/h, the action can be
rewritten as (see appendix c)

sn lsm =

8. area law of the wilson loop (i)

in this section we derive the area law of the wilson loop based on the instanton
calculus. 53),54),55) a more systematic estimation is given in the next section based
on the large n expansion.

the static potential v (r) is evaluated from the rectangular wilson loop c with

sides t and r according to

v (r) :=  lim
the (full) string tension  is dened by

a(c)

(8.1)

(8.2)

where a(c) is the minimal area of the surface spanned by the wilson loop c. of
course, the rectangular loop has minimal area: a(c) = t r.

using the nast for the wilson loop operator,

w c[a] =z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igic

naaa + iic

(cid:19) ,

(8.3)

we can write its expectation value in the yang-mills theory as 15), 17)

hw c[a]iy m4

 when we encounter the nls model obtained through dimensional reduction in the following

sections, the coupling constant g should be replaced as

(8.4)

where the measure r [d()]c gives a redundant factor which does not aect the

string tension in the area law, as shown in section iv.c of ref. 15) and hence it is
omitted in the following.

8.1. perturbative expansion and dimensional reduction

in our reformulation, the eld v a

 (x) is identied with the perturbative defor-
mation. thus we expand the rst exponential of (8.4) in powers of the coupling
constant g:

we restrict the wilson loop to a planar loop. this choice has the following advantage.
for the planar wilson loop c, the parisi-sourlas dimensional reduction leads to the
following identities: 13)

(cid:28) exp(cid:20)iic

(cid:21)(cid:29)t qf t4

this inequality is saturated when w satises the equation aw  iabbw = 0,
which is equivalent to the cauchy-riemann equation,
zw := (1 + i2)w = 0.

(8.22)

the solution w = f (z) is an arbitrary rational function of z.

the nite action conguration of the coset nls model is provided by the in-
stanton solution, which is a solution of the cauchy-riemann equation (8.22). it is
known 23) that the integer-valued topological charge q of the instanton in the fn 1
nls model is given by the integral of the kahler 2-form over r2:

thus the instanton solution is characterized by the integral topological charge

8.3. area law in the dilute instanton-gas approximation

if the wilson loop is large compared with the typical size of the instanton,

that are contained inside the area s  r2 bounded by the loop c:

k = (nin

+  nin
 ).

(8.33)

(see fig.7.) thus, the expectation value hexp (irs k )in lsm is calculated by sum-

ming over all the possible cases of instanton and anti-instanton congurations (i.e.,
by the integration over the instanton moduli). in this calculation, we use

where nout
 ) is the number of instantons (anti-instantons) outside s, and n+
(n) is the total number of instantons (anti-instantons). for the quark in the fun-
damental representation n (d1 = 1, d2 = d3 =  = dn 1 = 0), this is easily carried
out as follows.
for the su (3) case with [1, 0], an element   f2 is independent of w3, so that
w3 is redundant in this case. hence, it suces to consider the cp 2 model for the
fundamental quark (up to weyl symmetry). for cp 2, the kahler two-form is given
by (4.87)

k = im(1)2[(1 + |w1|2)dw2  d w2  w2w1dw2  d w1

w2 w1dw1  d w2 + (1 + |w2|2)dw1  d w1].

when w2 = 0, k reduces to

similarly, when w1 = 0, we have

k = i(1 + |w1|2)2dw1  d w1.

k = i(1 + |w2|2)2dw2  d w2.

(8.35)

(8.36)

(8.37)

for a polynomial w = w(z) in z = x + iy of order n, we nd the instanton charge

z k = q, q  z.

this is the same situation as that encountered in su (2), in which case

z k = 2jq,

(8.38)

(8.39)

where j = 1/2 corresponds to the fundamental representation. 13), 15) thus the wil-
son loop can be estimated by the naive instanton calculus. in fact, the dilute instan-
ton gas approximation leads to the area law for the wilson loop (see ref.13)). here
the factor  is very important. the integral of the kahler two-form k is a multiple

46

of . if we had a factor 2, the area law would not hold, just as in the j = 1 case of
su (2).

for the su (n ) case with dynkin index, [1, 0, , 0], it suces to consider the
cp n 1 model. when wa 6= 0 and wb = 0 for all b 6= a, the kahler two-form (4.53)
for cp n 1 reduces to

k = i(1 + |wa|2)2dwa  d wa,

(8.40)

with no summation over a. therefore the above argument can be applied to su (n )
for any n . this implies the connement of fundamental quarks in su (n ) yang-
mills theory within the approximation of a dilute instanton gas. this naive instanton
calculation can be improved by including uctuations from the instanton solutions
following ref.55), and this issue will be discussed in detail in a subsequent article. 43)

9. area law of the wilson loop (ii)

the derivation of the area law of the wilson loop in the four-dimensional yang-
mills theory in the ma gauge is reduced to demonstrating the area law of the diagonal
wilson loop in the two-dimensional coset nls model. in this section we complete
a derivation of the area law of the wilson loop in the fundamental representation.
here we use the large n expansion 56), 57), 58), 59), 60) for the coset nls model. (see,
e.g., refa.28), 29), 30), 31) for reviews of the large n expansion.)

to perform the large n expansion, it is convenient to introduce the new variables

pab(x) := a(x)b(x) = u1a(x) u1b(x),
v ab
 (x) := v a
which are used to rewrite

 (x)(t a)ab,

(9.1)
(9.2)

c(x) := na(x)v a

 (x) = pab(x)v ab
where a = 1, , n 2  1 and a, b = 1, n for su (n ).
the wilson loop operator in powers of the coupling constant g is rewritten as

in terms of the above variables, the expansion (8.7) of the expectation value of

in the leading order of the large n expansion. see fig. 9. however, it is extremely
dicult to sum up the innite number of terms belonging to the leading order of the
large n expansion and to obtain a closed expression in the four-dimensional case. of
course, this does not exclude the possibility that the closed expression obtained by

48

summing up all the leading diagrams may exhibit the area law. in fact, this strategy
has been applied in the two-dimensional case and has successfully lead to the area
law (see, e.g., ref.61)).

for the planar wilson loop c, we have already shown that the parisi-sourlas di-
mensional reduction occurs and that the tqft sector reduces to the two-dimensional
coset nls model, i.e. the nls model on the ag space fn 1. hence, we obtain

the large n expansion to the (perturbative) deformation sector and the tqft sector
simultaneously. taking the logarithm of the wilson loop, therefore, we obtain

it should be remarked that the f [c] is o(/n ). this is dierent from the result
of the usual large n expansion of the yang-mills theory, i.e., diagram (a) of fig. 9,
which is o(). this fact is shown as follows. in a previous article, 17) it is shown that
the perturbative sector obeys the lorentz-type gauge xing, v = 0, by virtue of
the background gauge. here we adopt the feynman gauge to simplify the calculation.

note that q(x, x) is o(n 2), and hence f [c] is o(/n ). this is because we consider

(9.25)

2(x2)v c

it is not dicult to show that the above estimation gives the correct order for
the higher-order terms, e.g., (b) and (e) in fig. 9, by making use of the relations
(4.73) and (4.74). for example, g3hv a
1(x1)v b
n(xn)ipy m4 is proportional to
ig4f abc, and ig4f abctr[t at bt c]/n 3 = g4f abcf abc/(4n 3) = o(g4), since
f abcf abd = c2(adj)cd and c2(adj) = n.
another way to understand this result is based on the idea of the reduction
of degrees of freedom that are responsible to the wilson loop. the ag space has
dimension dimfn 1 = n (n  1), whereas cp n 1 has dimension dimcp n 1 =
2(n  1). therefore, the number of relevant degrees of freedom is reduced for
the fundamental quark for large n , since dimcp n 1 = 2dimfn 1/n for large n .
indeed, this result is expected from the nast given by (4.54),

w c[a] =z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19) .

(9.26)

the abelian gauge eld a = tr(ha) has only two physical degrees of freedom, while
the non-abelian gauge eld a = aat a in the wilson loop (9.6) has 2(n 2  1)
components. thus the large n expansion is reduced to a perturbative expansion in
the coupling constant g. in this sense, the large n expansion combined with the
nast justies the identication of the deformation part with the perturbative part.
then we nd that the f [c] is of order o(/n ). therefore, to leading order in

the large n expansion, the static potential and the string tension are given by

now we proceed to estimate the second term, f [c]. we will show that the second
term gives at most the perimeter law, so that the area law (if it exists) is provided
by the rst term. because of the factor  in hv a

(9.33)

h[c] :=

dyd(x, y). (9.34)

by taking into account all the contributions from parallel sides dx and dy (see fig.10),
h[c] is calculated as, for t > r  1,

r

(9.36)

and the second term in h[c] corresponds to the self-energy of quark and anti-quark.
furthermore, if we take into account the o(g4) correction, the coupling constant
begins to run and the bare coupling g in (9.36) is replaced by the running coupling
constant g = g() (see, e.g., kogut 62)). in the topologically trivial case, therefore,
the second term f [c] cannot give a non-vanishing string tension.

next, we consider the topologically non-trivial case. we begin to estimate (9.29)
for a circular wilson loop c with diameter r (see fig.11). if we avoid the coinciding
case, x = y, f [c] has a contribution only when x and y are at opposite ends of a

 the contribution up to o(2) in the leading order diagrams (planar diagram) in the large n
expansion leads to a running coupling that diersfrom that in the usual perturbative calculation in
the coupling constant g.

to translational invariance. for any x, y  c, |x  y| = r and

hence we obtain

f [c] =

.

(9.37)

(9.38)

it is clear that f [c] is not sucient to give a non-vanishing string tension, since
gc (x, y) exhibits exponential decay for large r := |x  y|. note that pab(x) and
hc  = rs d are u(1) gauge invariant quantities, so that gc (x, y) is also u(1)
gauge invariant. in the large n expansion, we can give a more precise estimate of
the second term (see appendix e).

finally, we consider the topologically nontrivial case of a rectangular wilson
loop c with side lengths r and t (see fig.10). in this case, we cannot give a precise
estimate of the second term, since we cannot perform the integration exactly. to
leading order in the 1/n expansion, it turns out that

gc (x, y) = g(x, y) := 2(t a)ab(t a)cdhpab(x)pcd(y)icp n1

2

,

(9.39)

and that g(x, y) decays exponentially for suciently large |x y| (see appendix e).
note that x and y are located on the opposite sides of the rectangular wilson loop.
therefore, there exists an uniform upper bound,
| g(x, y)|  g(r).

(9.40)

hence, there exists an upper bound on f [c] for a suciently large wilson loop such
that t > r  1:

|f [c]| 


2n

g(r)h[c].

(9.41)

here h[c] is calculated in the same way as in (9.35) by taking into account all the
contributions from parallel sides dx and dy (see fig.10). therefore the second term
f [c] cannot give non-vanishing string tension in the topologically nontrivial case.

thus, within this reformulation, the area law of the non-abelian wilson loop and
the linear static potential in four-dimensional su (n ) yang-mills theory is realized

nls model obeys the area law

if and only if the diagonal wilson loop (cid:28) exp (ihc )(cid:29)cp n1

in other words, the area law or the linear potential between the fundamental quark

cp n1

2

 exp(0t r). (9.43)

53

in any case, the derivation of the area law is reduced to a two-dimensional problem.

it should be remarked that only the total static potential,

v (r) = 0r 

g2()

+ const.,

(9.44)

is gauge invariant. thus the linear potential piece alone is not gauge invariant.
however, in the large r limit, r  , the linear potential is dominant in v (r) so
that the linear potential piece becomes essentially gauge invariant.

9.2. area law to the leading order in the large n expansion

in terms of u without the constraint, e.g.,

by way of the variable u, we have found that the connection one-form  appear-

for the cp 1 model, this reduces to v (6.51) in ref.13) for g = su (2).

the expectation value hexp (ihc v )icp n1 is calculated in appendix d in the

large n expansion in a manner based on pioneering works. 56), 57), 58) the result agrees
with the result of campostrini and rossi. 60) to leading order in the 1/n expansion,
the wilson loop obeys the area law for all non-self-intersecting loops:

here m is the mass of the cp n 1 eld . the m2
 is equal to the vacuum ex-
pectation value h(x)i of the lagrange multiplier eld  from the correspondence
(x) (x)(x)  m2
(x)(x). in the propagator of the vector eld v , a massless
pole appears. hence, the auxiliary vector eld v becomes a dynamical gauge eld,
giving rise to a linear conning potential between  and . on the other hand,
the lagrange multiplier eld  for the constraint (9.46) becomes massive, so that it
does not contribute to the conning potential between  and . thus we have com-
pleted a proof of quark connement in four-dimensional su (n ) yang-mills theory
based on the wilson criterion to leading order in the large n expansion within our
reformulation of the yang-mills theory.

10. remarks

some remarks are in order to avoid confusion.

10.1. calculating gauge invariant quantity in the gauge non-invariant theory

the wilson loop operator wc[a] is invariant under the gauge transformation
denoted by u (x), which is dened by the decomposition of the variable in (7.1)
or (7.10), since it is a gauge-invariant quantity. therefore, the expression of the
wilson loop operator given by the non-abelian stokes theorem derived in this paper
is also invariant under arbitrary (i.e., innitesimal and nite) gauge transformation.
therefore, the variable u (x) does not contribute to the wilson loop operator, and
we can write

wc[a] = wc[v],

(10.1)

which is a mathematical identity. this is indeed the situation before taking the ex-
pectation value hwc[a]iy m in terms of the yang-mills theory. however, this seems
to contradict the claim of this paper; the area law can be derived from the contri-
bution of the topologically non-trivial degrees of freedom expressed by the variable
u (x), which is described by the tqft. in fact, we have used the formula (7.19) to
calculate the expectation value of the wilson loop operator in  8. therefore, if we
set

in the expectation value hiy m , we would obtain the inconsistent result

g(v, u ) = g(v) = wc[v],

h(u ) = 1,

hwc [a]iy m = hwc[v]ipy mh1it qf t = hwc[v]ipy m ?

(10.2)

(10.3)

since this implies that there is no contribution from the topological part expressed
by u and that the wilson loop can be calculated by the perturbative part only.

this apparent contradiction can be understood as follows. elimination of the
u -dependence is possible only when the gauge theory itself is formulated in a gauge
invariant way, just as the lattice gauge theory can be written in a manifestly gauge
invariant manner without gauge xing. in such a case, we can perform the gauge
transformation so that a gauge invariant quantity, e.g., the wilson loop, has no de-
pendence on u (x) also in the expectation value. however, our strategy is totally

56

dierent from this case. that is to say, we calculate the gauge-invariant quantity
using the gauge xed (i.e, gauge non-invariant) theory, where the o-diagonal compo-
nents and the diagonal components are subject to dierent gauge xing conditions.
therefore, the total action stot
y m [a,] = sy m [a] + sgf +f p [a,] obtained by
adding the gf+fp term sgf +f p [a,] to the yang-mills action sy m [a] does not
y m [v, b, c, c] obtained
have the same form as the gauge-transformed total action stot
by the gauge rotation u , although sy m [a] = sy m [v]. in this sense,

where

hwc[a]iy m 6= hwc [v]iy m ,

hwc [a]iy m := z 1

y mz da  exp{istot

y m [a,]}wc [a].

(10.4)

(10.5)

thus it should be remarked that the formula (7.19) holds only when the eld variable
a is separated into v and u and at the same time the respective component is iden-
tied with the topologically trivial (perturbative) and non-trivial (non-perturbative)
components, respectively, where the v-dependent part is calculated using perturba-
tive yang-mills (pym) theory. this is an assumption of our approach. in this sense,
eq. (7.19) holds under this assumption and it is not a mathematical identity. in our
approach, an arbitrary gauge transformation is not allowed under the functional of
the expectation value, i.e., hiy m , once the respective component is identied with
the relevant degrees of freedom in yang-mills theory. (thus, if we wish to change
the integration variable as in (10.2), the total yang-mills theory should be modifed
simultaneously. this leads to a more complicated theory.) in this paper we have
xed the gauge degrees of freedom for the variable u (x) using the modied ma
gauge. in other words, we have chosen a specic eld conguration of {u (x)} to
calculate the physical quantity in such a way that the u -dependence is controlled by
the ma gauge xing term. this is an essential point of our strategy. in this sense,
the physics enters in when we consider the expectation value.

10.2. the gribov problem and dimensional reduction

dimensional reduction of the parisi-sourlas type was applied to the random
eld ising model 73) and scalar eld theories with random external sources 74), 75), 76)
based on non-perturbative 74), 75) and rigorous methods. 73), 76) in these models it
has been recognized 77), 78) that the parisi-sourlas correspondence (between random
systems in d dimensions and the corresponding pure systems in d 2 dimensions, or
supersymmetric theory in d dimensions and the corresponding bosonic theory in d2
dimensions) is exact only in the case of unique solutions to the classical equation of
motion. in fact, it was rigorously shown 73) that the three-dimensional ising model
in a random magnetic eld exhibits long-range order at zero temperature and small
disorder. this implies that the lower critical dimension d for this model is 2 (ruling
out d = 3), where the lower-critical dimension is the dimension above which (d > d)
long-range ferromagnetic order can exist. therefore, this result contradicts the naive
prediction 72) between the random eld ising model in d dimensions and the pure
ising model in d  2 dimensions.

57

in gauge theories, a similar problem can in principle arise due to the existence
of gribov copies, although much is not known on this issue. indeed, it is known 80)
that gribov copies exist for the naive ma gauge. on the other hand, it is not known
whether the modied ma gauge with osp(d|2) symmetry possesses the gribov
copies or not. if gribov copies exist, rst of all, the naive brst formulation breaks
down. even if a modied brst formulation can exist, the brst symmetry can be
spontaneously broken, 79) at least in the topological sector (described by the modied
ma gauge action), where the large (or nite) gauge transformation with non-trivial
winding number plays a crucial role.
in this case, the vacuum in the topological
sector is not annihilated by the brst charge qb (i.e., qb|0it qf t 6= 0), whereas
the perturbative sector (in which there exist small quantum uctuation around an
arbitrary but xed topological background) is characterized by the unbroken brst
charge, i.e., qb|0ipy m = 0. even in this case, dimensional reduction should take
place, since we have used neither the eld equations nor the above property of the
brst charge acting on the state. in other words, the dimensional reduction is an
origin of the spontaneous breaking of the brst symmetry (see refs.17),42)). more-
over, the brst symmetry can also be broken by other mechanisms, e.g., radiative
corrections.

in any case, the spontaneous breaking of the brst symmetry in the topological
sector implies that the expectation value of the gauge invariant operator depends
on the gauge xing parameter  for the topological sector. in this case, we can not
conclude the -independence of the physical (gauge-invariant) quantities. rather,
the value of  should be determined as a physical parameter by the theory 43) or
experiments. this is reasonable if we believe that the real world is described by a
unique quantum theory and that nature is realized at an appropriate gauge xing,
since the classical theory does not really exist in nature, and hence ambiguities arising
in the quantization are absent from the beginning. it is a challenge to give a denite
answer to these questions. the author would like to thank the referee for pointing
out the gribov problem as an obstacle to the dimensional reduction.

11. conclusion and discussion

we have given a new version of the non-abelian stokes theorem for g = su (n )
with n  2 which reduces to the previous result 15) for su (2). this version of
the non-abelian wilson loop is very helpful to see the role played by the magnetic
monopole in the calculation of the expectation value of the non-abelian wilson loop.
combining this non-abelian stokes theorem with the abelian-projected eective
gauge theory for su (n ), we have explained the abelian dominance for the wilson
loop in su (n ) yang-mills gauge theory. for su (n ) with n  3, we must distinguish
the maximal stability group h and the residual gauge group h, which is taken to
be the maximal torus group h = u (1)n 1.

in order to demonstrate the magnetic monopole dominance and the area law
of the wilson loop, we have used a novel reformulation of the yang-mills theory
which has been proposed by one of the authors. 13) this reformulation is based on
the identication of the yang-mills theory with the perturbative deformation of a

58

topological quantum eld theory. this framework deals with the gauge action sy m
and the gauge-xing action sgf on an equal footing. the gauge action is charac-
terized from the viewpoint of the geometry of connections. on the other hand, the
gauge-xing part is related to the topological invariant (euler characteristic) deter-
mined by a global topology. therefore, the gauge-xing part can have a geometric
meaning from a global viewpoint. this point has not been emphasized in textbooks
on quantum eld theory. (see ref.17) for more details.)

our approach relies heavily on a specic gauge, the ma gauge. in spite of the
absence of an elementary scalar eld in yang-mills theory, the ma gauge allows
the existence of the magnetic monopole. the magnetic monopole is considered as a
topological soliton composed of gauge degrees of freedom, providing the composite
scalar eld. at least in this gauge, (parisi-sourlas) dimensional reduction occurs
due to the supersymmetry hidden in the gauge xing part in the ma gauge. by
making use of the non-abelian stokes theorem within this reformulation of the yang-
mills theory, the derivation of the area law of the non-abelian wilson loop in four-
dimensional yang-mills theory has been reduced to the two-dimensional problem
of calculating the expectation value of the abelian wilson loop in the coset g/h
non-linear sigma model. this is the main result of this article.

in particular, in order to demonstrate connement of the fundamental quark in
the four-dimensional su (n ) yang-mills theory in the ma gauge, we have only to
consider the two-dimensional cp n 1 model. from the topological point of view,
the abelian wilson loop is equivalent to the area integral (enclosed by the wil-
son loop) of the instanton density in the two-dimensional nls model. this implies
that the calculation of the magnetic monopole contribution to the wilson loop in
four-dimensional yang-mills theory was translated into that of the instanton contri-
bution in the two-dimensional nls model when the wilson loop is contained in the
two-dimensional plane, i.e. when the wilson loop is planar. in addition, the two-
dimensional instanton is considered as a subclass of the four-dimensional yang-mills
instanton (see ref.13)). this suggests that the area law of the wilson loop can be
derived by taking into account the contributions of a restricted class of yang-mills
instantons. a monte carlo simulation on a lattice will be ecient in conrming this
dimensionally reduced picture of quark connement. 64)

moreover, naive instanton calculus (the dilute gas approximation) in the coset
nls model leads to the area law of the wilson loop of the original four-dimensional
yang-mills theory. improvements of the dilute gas approximation are necessary to
conrm the area law based on the above picture. however, this is rather dicult, as
found more than twenty years ago. 55) an advantage of the extension of the above
strategy to su (n ) with arbitrary n is that the large n systematic expansion can
be used in the calculation of the wilson loop, and that the area law of the wilson
loop has been demonstrated. these results conrm the area law of the wilson loop.
it is known that the large n yang-mills theory is related to the string theory. the
correspondence between instanton calculus and the large n expansion and a related
issue in the large n expansion in yang-mills theory will also be discussed in a
subsequent article. 43) these considerations should shed more light on the conning
string picture. 65)

in su (n ), the simple root i and the dynkin index [m1, mn 1] are dened
by (3.47) and i   := mi/2. in general, the roots e belonging to the coset group
g/ h are not orthogonal to the highest weight . we restrict our consideration to
only the case of [m, 0, , 0], in which case only 1 is not orthogonal to . any
positive root  is given by a linear combination of simple roots i. the positive
roots i in (a.1) are not orthogonal to , so they must include 1. it turns out that
such roots are given by i := 1 +  + i (i = 1, n  1) , which are realized by
(e i)kl = 1,ki+1,l/2 in the n representation. the corresponding coherent state
parametrizes cp n 1. we can easily extend the cp 2 case to that of cp n 1 using
the fact that [e i, e j ] = 0 and i  ~ = m/2. (this situation is same as in the
su (3) case, i.e., [e1, e2] = 0, and (1)  ~ = (2)  ~ = m/2.) thus we obtain

the diagramatic representation of this expansion is given in fig. 13 using the rule
given in fig. 12.

first, the order n 1/2 term corresponds to the diagrams (a) and (b) in fig. 13:

s(1) =

(d.12)

(d.13)

(d.14)

the integral in (d.13) is ultraviolet divergent. it can be regularized by introducing
the cuto . the saddle point condition s(1) = 0 requires the bare coupling constant
g0 to vary with the cuto  according to

in other words, if the bare coupling g0 varies with respect to the cuto according to

(d.16)

the divergences cancel in s(1). this implies the asymptotic freedom of the cp n 1
model. imposing the condition s(1) = 0, therefore, we obtain

m2 = 2 exp"

r()# .

(d.17)

next, the order n 0 term corresponds to the diagrams (c),(d) and (e) in fig. 13:

s(2) =

1

2z d2xz d2y[(x) (x, y)(y) + a(x) (x, y)a (y)],

(d.18)

where the fourier transformation of  (x, y) and (x, y) are respectively given by
(see fig. 13)

 (p) =z

(d.20)

in the neighbourhood of p2 = 0, we have

thus we obtain the low-energy eective action,

(d.22)

it is important to note that the kinetic terms for the lagrangian multiplier elds are
generated. the eld  becomes massive, while the eld a(= n v) is massless.

the line integral in the wilson loop can be rewritten as

ic

(d.23)

where

j(z) =ic

d2(z  ) =  (z), (z) =(cid:26) 1 (z  sc)
0 (z / sc)

. (d.24)

here sc is the area bounded by the loop c. up to leading order, we can perform
the gaussian integration to obtain

71

(cid:28) exp(cid:20)iic

dv()(cid:21)(cid:29)cp n1 = z 1[0, 0, 0]z ddaes(2)

thus we obtain the area law,

(d.26)

since j = d and  := d + d, and hence

(j, 1j) :=z d2xz d2yj(x)1(x, y)j(y) = (, ) = |sc|. (d.27)

the dynamically generated gauge eld a produces a long-range force with a linear
potential that connes the s. both global su (n ) and local u (1) symmetries are
unbroken in two dimensions due to the coleman theorem. in dimensions d > 2, it
has been shown 70) that there is a critical point gc such that for g < gc su (n ) and
u (1) symmetries are broken, hai 6= 0, while hi = 0. in this phase  is regarded
as the nambu-goldstone particle, since m = 0. a massless vector pole exists in
the propagator ha(x)a (0)i. 71) for g > gc, on ther other hand, the su (n ) and
u (1) symmetries are exact, implying hai = 0, and hi 6= 0.
in this phase,  is
massive, m = hi. for d = 2, gc = 0. for more details on large n results, see

the large n expansion shows that the eld  becomes massive, so that the two-point

note that p is a projection operator with the properties

[here note that each contribution should be divided by the normalization factor n for
the fundamental quark, in agreement with the denition (9.6).] in the leading order of large
n expansion, the leading contributions come from the planar diagrams, e.g., (a), (b), (c), (e)
and (f), which are furthermore classied by the order of . note that the contribution from a
nonplanar diagram (d) is suppressed for large n . the diagram (g) is the vacuum polarization
diagram due to quarkanti-quark pair creation and annihilation, which is neglected in the pure
yang-mills theory without dynamical quarks.
