(46) (47) (48) 4 generalization crucial ingredient preceding section came rather simple observation: two dierent ways determining 1/4 bps dyon mass. eld theoretic one gives exact 10 expression, derived approximate low energy dynamics moduli space monopoles. possible moduli space dynamics already incorporates various internal excitations induce relative electric charges. comparing two, one obtains approximate form inter-monopole potential arbitrarily accurate higgs expec- tations become collinear. section, utilize simple idea x bosonic part low energy eective lagrangian 1/2 bps 1/4 bps states maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory. first consider 1/2 bps multi-monopole conguration, arbitrary gauge group g broken u (1)r single higgs eld expectation value hb = h root space. always set simple roots a, = 1, ...r h > 0. bps magnetic monopole conguration would magnetic charge g = g(n11 + n22 + ... + nrr), (49) nonnegative nas. without loss generality, assume irreducible na positive. case monopoles interacting directly indirectly divided noninteracting subclusters. monopole type mass ga = gh four zero modes. total energy gpa naa = g h total number zero mode 4n = 4pa na {$9804174$}. low energy dynamics conguration described dynamics moduli space dimension 4n metric ds2 = g dzdz . moduli space known hyperkahler thus equipped three covariantly constant complex structures . low energy lagrangian l1 = 1 2 g z z .
