abstract

the production of string charge during a crossing of certain ori-
ented d-branes is studied. we compute the string charge in the system
of a probe d2-brane and a background d6-brane by use of the equa-
tions of motion in the ten-dimensions. we conrm the creation of
string charge as inow from the background d6-brane.

it was rst pointed out in [1] that d3-branes are created when certain
oriented ns5-brane and d5-brane cross each other and then the created
branes are suspended between these 5-branes. this phenomenon has several
cousins related by u-duality. for example, a fundamental string is created
when a dp-brane and a d(8-p)-brane, which are mutually transverse, cross.
they have been conrmed from various points of view [2]-[17].

however, it has not been claried yet how the charge of created brane
emerges when the branes cross. in this letter we examine in particular the
system of a probe d2-brane and a background d6-brane. we calculate the
created string charge by use of the equations of motion derived from the
action in the ten-dimensions. this ten-dimensional action itself is obtainable
from the eleven-dimensional one with m2-brane source term. the d6-brane
background is realized by the taub-nut geometry in the eleven-dimensions.
the string charge in this particular system turns out to be qf 1 = rt (1 +
cos 0), where 0 is a parameter of the m2-brane embedding, t is the tension
of it and r is the radius of s1 of the eleventh-direction. before or after the
crossing of these branes (equivalently 0 is  or 0 respectively, as will be
explained later), one can see qf 1 will be 0 or 2rt . this means indeed the
creation of string charge which is supplied from the background d6-brane.

the original technique used here was given in [18] in which they studied
the duality between kk- and h-monopoles in the type ii theory by showing
the charge inow of a string into the kk-monopole background.

our starting point is the eleven-dimensional sugra (m-theory) whose

bosonic part is [19]

where gm n is the eleven-dimensional metric (m, n, . . . = 0, 1, . . . , 10) and
g4 = dc3 is the eld strength of the three-form gauge eld c3. the m2-
brane has the electric charge of c3. adding the non-linear -model action as

t is the membrane tension and x m are the space-time coordinates of the
m2-brane. the world volume coordinates and the induced metric on the
m2-brane are denoted by i(i = 0, 1, 2) and ij.

let us consider the dimensional reduction of the actions into the ten-
dimensions. they provide the iia sugra theory. the eleven-dimensional
metric gm n transmutes into ten-dimensional metric g (,  = 0, 1, . . . , 9),

our next task is to describe a d6-brane background in the iia theory. it is
well known that the action (1) admits the eleven-dimensional kk-monopole
solution and in the iia limit it becomes the d6-brane [20]. thus we consider
the kk-monopole in the eleven-dimensions which is described by taub-nut
metric (plus the at seven-dimensions),

ds2 = mndxmdxn + u hdx10 + adi2

+ u 1(dr2 + r2d2

2),

(10)

where m, n = 0, 1, . . . , 6. to avoid the singularity at r = 0, x10 must have
periodicity 2r, where r is the radius of the circle of the eleventh-direction.
the potential terms a and u(r) are

as

 =

r
2

(1 + cos ),

u(r) = (1 +

r
2r

)1.

(11)

(12)

we denote the coordinates regular at the south pole ( = ) and the north
pole ( = 0) respectively by the indices s and n. the metric (10) dened
by eq.(11) is non-singular at the south pole but has a coordinate singularity
at the north pole( = 0). the singularity can be removed by

x10
n = x10

s + r,

then the direction of dirac string is changed,

an

 =

(1 + cos ).

(13)

(14)

this transformation of coordinates plays particularly important role when
we discuss the creation of string charge. comparing the metric to eq.(3), we
take u = e

3 .

the equations (9) could become simpler in the taub-nut background.

the term in the left hand side of the third equation in (9),  (gf ),

trivially vanishes. the terms in the eqs.(9), which originate from chern-
simon-like term in the action (6), turn out to be irrelevant as will be shown.
dropping out these terms, the equations of motion (9) become

c : (gg) = gj
b : h = gj

d2  t z d3(10)(x  x )ijkix jx kx ,

 z d3(10)(x  x )ijkix jx kx 10 + (gga),

a : gh = 6t z d3(10)(x  x )iju  1
where h  gu  3
2 h , jd2 and jf 1 are the d2-brane and the fun-
damental string currents. we take p-brane charge as q = rs 8p fp+2 =
rv 9p jp+1. here fp+2 is the (p + 2)-form eld strength and jp+1 is the p-

brane current. the denition of the hodge dual contain a dilaton dependent
factor to correctly have a generalized electric-magnetic duality.

(15)

now, let us consider the following embedding of a probe m2-brane in the

eleven-dimensions in order to check the consistency of eqs.(15),

x 10 = 2r1,
x t = 0,
x r = 2,
x  = 0,
x  = 0,
x m = 0

m = 1 . . . 6.

(16)

this embedding describes the conguration of an m2-brane wrapping ex-
clusively around the eleventh-direction. therefore, in the ten-dimensions, it
becomes a string which is extending towards the r-direction.

with this embedding the eqs.(15) become

c :

b :

a :

(gg) = 0,
h = gj

f 1

gh = 0.

= (gga)  2rt z d3(10)(x  x )ij1ix jx ,

(17)

let g = 0. the current which couples to the ns-ns 2-form b can be
read as

gjtr

f 1 = rt ()()(6)(x).

thus we have the charge of the fundamental string,

qf 1 = z d6xddgjtr

= 2rt.

(18)

(19)

this is in agreement with the relation of string charge and m2-brane charge.
hence the equations (15) provide the desired result for the above embedding.

we would like to consider the system of a probe d2-brane in the d6-
brane background both of which are mutually transversed. we will show
the creation of string charge in view of the iia theoretical stand point. for
this purpose we examine the following embedding of an m2-brane in the
eleven-dimensions.

x t = 0,
x r = 2,
x  = 0(const),
x  = 21,
x m = 0,
x 10

s = 0.

(20)

obviously, the m2-brane has no winding around the eleventh-direction in the
coordinate system regular at the south pole. on the other hand, it can wind
around the direction, i.e. x 10
n = 21, in the coordinate system regular at the
north pole obtained by the gauge transformation (13). this seems to imply
string charge creation in the ten-dimensional view point. we will investigate
concretely this phenomenon by use of the equations of motions(15).

our interest is the string charge that is the topological charge associated
with the winding around the eleventh-direction. hence we do not need to take
care of supersymmetry. however, before calculating the string charge, it is
worth considering the correspondence between the embedding (20) and that
of [13, 14] which preserve supersymmetry manifestly. in those papers string
creation was shown by investigating geometrically the shape of an m2-brane
but not the winding around the eleventh-direction. they introduce [21] the
following holomorhpic coordinates (v, y) to describe the embedding of the
m2-brane.

m2-brane embedded holomorphically in the kk-monopole background is
given by 3

y = const.

(23)

the shape of the m2-brane described by this curve looks a parabolic-like
surface, see fig 1(a). the embedding (20) means that we approximate this
surface by a cone in the eleven-dimensions, see fig 1(c). even though this
approximation is not compatible with complex structure of the taub-nut
space, we may use the approximation to study the ns-ns charge since the
embedding to the eleventh-direction will play the role in the determination
of the charge and it can be still captured by this approximation. the kk-
monopole is located in the distance of the right (left) innity in the eleven-

3 although the conguration considered in [13] is m5-brane with a kk-monopole,
the same relation is also applicable to our case, an m2-brane, because the condition of
holomorphy is for the two-dimensional part of branes. in our case the topology of the
m2-brane world volume is r1 , where  is holomorphically embedded riemann surface
in taub-nut space.

dimensions before (after) string creation in ten-dimensions [13, 14]. here
we set the position of the kk-monopole the origin by a parallel shift of
the coordinates. the conguration in fig 1(a), which describes the created
string in the ten-dimensions, corresponds to the case of 0 = 0. the m2-brane
should be pulled by the kk-monopole when it moves, since it is attached to
the m2-brane in the embedding (20). hence when the kk-monopole moves
to the right direction in fig 1, 0 should become . therefore the parameter
0 should be  or 0 before or after the branes cross, respectively.

we now start to calculate string charge by inserting the embedding (20)
(or (13)) to (15). as the probe brane is a point-like object in view of the space
of the d6 brane world volume, it is natural to take spherical coordinates, l and
i (i = 1, . . . , 5) where l is the radial direction and is are the angular ones in
the space. we assume that the indices run over only the t, r, , , l directions.
as we mentioned before, the parts in eqs.(9) from the chern-simon term
automatically vanish under the assumption. we nd the following solution,

ggtrl = t (  0)(l)(5)(i),

htr = 2rt (1 + cos 0)(  0)(l)(5)(i)  (r, 0)
htrl = (r, 0)(xl),
htl = r(r, 0)(xl)  ,



(xl)  ,

(24)

otherwise = 0,

where (r, ) = 4rr2 sin (1 + cos )q||11 and we used the fact that
(x)(x) = 1
2 (x). then the non-vanishing currents of the d2-brane and the
string become

gjtr
gjtr

f 1 =

d2 = t (l)(5)(i),

rt
2

(1 + cos 0)(  0)(l)(5)(i).

(25)

(26)

we should note that the form of these equations does not depend on the
selection of coordinate patches. the charge of the d2-brane and the string

8

become

qd2 = t,

qf 1 = rt (1 + cos 0).

(27)

(28)

thus we nally obtain string charge creation, qf 1 becomes 2rt from 0 as
0 going to 0 from . this gives correct relation between the string tension
and that of d2-brane. the net charge must be conserved in the whole space,
therefore we conclude that the electric ns-ns charge must be supplied from
the d6-brane. note that qd2 does not depend on 0. this means the d2-
brane always exists on the process of string creation.
