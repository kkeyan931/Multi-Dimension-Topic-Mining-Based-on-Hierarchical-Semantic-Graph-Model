1. elastic quark-quark and gluon-gluon scattering at large s and xed t (mandelstam

variables) pertains to the domain of non-perturbative qcd. theoretical procedures based

on resuming large classes of perturbative contributions have been proposed [1, 2], partially

accounting for the reggeized form of the scattering amplitude and the phenomenological

success of pomeron/odderon exchange models [2] (and references therein). in an inspiring

approach, nachtmann [3] and others [4, 5, 6] suggested to use non-perturbative techniques

for the elastic scattering amplitude. in the eikonal approximation and to leading order in
t/s the quark-quark amplitude at large s was reduced to a correlation function of two
light-like wilson-lines. the latter was assessed in the stochastic vacuum model [3].

recently, maldacena [7] has made the remarkable conjecture that the large n behav-

ior of n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory is dual to the string theory in a non-trivial geom-

etry. this ads/cft conjecture, made more precise by gubser, klebanov and polyakov [8]

and by witten [9] and extended to the non-supersymmetric case by witten [10], provides an

interesting and nonperturbative avenue for studying gauge theories at large n and strong

coupling g2

y m n . in particular the heavy quark potential was found to be coulombic for

supersymmetric theories and linear for non-supersymmetric theories [9, 14].

in this letter we suggest to use the ads/cft approach to analyze the elastic parton-

parton scattering amplitude in the eikonal approximation for n = 4 sym. in section 2

we briey discuss the salient features of the parton-parton reduced elastic amplitude at
large s. the scattering amplitude in the eikonal approximation is reduced to the fourier
transform of the connected part of a correlator of two time-like wilson lines. in section 3

we use the ads/cft approach to calculate the correlator. following [11, 12], we propose

that it is given by the minimum (regularized) area of the world-sheet with the time-like

parton trajectories at its boundaries, and give a simple variational method that allows for

a closed-form expression for the minimal area in the presence of a nite time cuto.

in

section 4 we summarize and conclude.

2. first consider the quark propagator in an external non-abelian gauge eld. in

the rst quantized theory, the propagator from x to y in minkowski space reads

s(x, y; a) = dx|

that is [16, 17]

where pc,s are orderings over color and spin matrices, and  = [, ]/2. the rst

exponent in the path integral is an arbitrary wilson line in the fundamental representation

of su(n)c, and the second exponent is a string of innitesimal thomas-precession along the

wilson line. the integration is over all paths with x(0) = x and x(t ) = y, where t is
the proper-time [17]. the dominant contributions come from those paths with t  1/m.
heavy quarks travel shorter in proper-time than light quarks and the mass gives an eective

cuto of the proper-time range. this observation will be important below.

a quark with large momentum p travels on a straight line with 4-velocity x = u =
p/m and u2 = 1. throughout, we will distinguish between the 4-velocity u and the
instantaneous 3-velocity v = dx/dt = p/e  1. for a straight trajectory, the 4-acceleration
x = a = 0 and the spin factor drops. this is the eikonal approximation for s in which
an ordinary quark transmutes to a scalar quark. the present argument applies to any

charged particle in a background gluon eld, irrespective of its spin or helicity. the only

amendments are:

for antiquarks the 4-velocity v is reversed in the wilson line and the

color matrices are in the complex representation, while for gluons the wilson lines are in the

adjoint representation. with this in mind, quark-quark scattering can be also extended to

quark-antiquark, gluon-gluon or scalar-scalar scattering. we note that for quark-antiquark
scattering the elastic amplitude dominates at large s since the annihilation part is down
by pt/s.

generically, we will refer to elastic parton-parton scattering as

qa(p1) + qb(p2)  qc(k1) + qd(k2)

(3)

with s = (p1 + p2)2, t = (p1  k1)2, s + t + u = 4m2. we denote by ab and cd respectively,
the incoming and outgoing color and spin of the quarks (polarization for gluons). using
the eikonal form for (1) and lsz reduction, the scattering amplitude t may be reduced
to [3, 4, 5]

tab,cd(s, t)  2isz d2b eiqbd (w1(b))ac (w2(0))bdec

where

w1,2(z) = pcexp(cid:18)igy m z +

we are using the normalization hwi = 1, and retaining only the connected part in (4).
the normalization can be relaxed if needed. the 2-dimensional integral in (4) is over the
impact parameter b with t = q2

q = p1  k1  (0, 0, q) and s  4e2. the averaging in (4) is over the gauge congurations
using the qcd action. the total cross section for s >> t > 0 follows from (4) in the
form  = im t /s < ln2s, where the last inequality is just the froissart bound.

the amplitude (4) allows for two gauge-invariant decompositions (repeated indices

are summed over)

t1 = tab,ab

t2 = tab,ba

(6)

assuming that the gluon-gauge elds are periodic at the end-points. we note that t2 is
down by 1/n in comparison to t1. for gluon-gluon scattering the lines are doubled in color
space (i.e., adjoint representation) and several gauge-invariant contractions are possible.
for quark-quark scattering the singlet exchange in t-channel is 0+ (pomeron) while for

quark-antiquark it is 0 (odderon) as the two dier by charge conjugation.

3.

in the eikonal approximation the parton-parton scattering amplitude is related to

an appropriate correlator of two wilson lines. the typical duration of these light-like lines
is t  1/m as we noted above. we now suggest to analyze the gauge-invariant correlators
using the ads/cft [7, 9] approach for n=4 sym.

the correlation function in large n and strong coupling g2

y m n can be obtained from
the minimal surface in the ve-dimensional ads space, [7, 12, 9] with the light-like wilson

lines at its boundaries as shown in fig. 1. the classical action for a string world-sheet is

s =

the ads metric gm n in poincare coordinates is given by

where r = (2g2

y m . the ads
space has a boundary in minkowski space m4 at z = 0. the boundary condition on the

y m n 2)1/4 is the radius of the ads space, with 2gst = g2

string world-sheet is given by the two time-like trajectories

x = vt = u, y = 0, z = 0; and x = vt, y = b, z = 0

(9)

with 3-velocities v = u/ and t the real time #1. the minimal surface associated to (7-9)

leads to a set of coupled partial dierential equations, which we have not yet managed to

solve exactly. instead, we provide a variational estimate as we now explain.

first, we divide the string world-sheet by constant time slices, each containing a

string connected to two boundary points. then we assume that for the minimal surface,

this string length is minimal. so by nding the minimal length and carrying the integration

over time, we will obtain an approximate minimal area. specically, we choose an orthogonal
coordinate system (, ) with the property x x  = 0 on the world-sheet. then,

be the length of the string ending on the two receding quarks at the boundary with

separation l(t). l(t) depends on t only through l(t)(= l( )), so that l(t) and l( ) represent

the same quantity. first, we minimize this length and then form the area by adding up

the areas of the strips between the hyper-planes of time t and t + dt. the height of the

strip at the boundary is dt1  v2 = d where  is the proper-time at the boundary. the
height of the strip at the central point of the string is given by dtq1  z0(t)2 where z0(t) is

the maximum value of z at xed t. therefore by the trapezoidal rule, the minimal area is

given by

(12)

where lmin(t) is the minimal length for a xed time slice. to summarize: we have replaced
2)/2, which is  independent. the latter substitution

dq(x )2 by dt (1  v2 +p1  z0

is made in the cm frame. lorentz invariance follows by rewriting the results in terms of

lorentz scalars.

mandelstam variable and the 4-velocity. in each case the meaning should be clear from the text.

the minimal length lmin(t) can be found by choosing a coordinate system such that

the two quarks are located at x = l( )/2 and x = l( )/2. then

l(t) = z +l(t)/2

where l(t) = b2 + 4v2t2 (u = vt) is the separation between the two time-like receding
partons at the boundary z = 0.
in the instantaneous approximation, the string adjusts
instantaneously to the change in the minimal length l(t) at the boundary. #2 it follows

that the problem of nding a minimal l(t) is almost identical to the problem of nding a

static q q potential [11, 12]. the result for a properly regularized length is

l(t) =

l(t)

with c0 = (2)3/( 1

z0(t) = c1l(t),

(14)

(15)

where c1 = 1/c0  0.834. hence under the instantaneous approximation, the area is

obtained by integrating the static potential.

#2 this implicit approximation follows from the fact that we have neglected the orthogonality constraint

dierence from (17) : the time dilatation factors generated by the string are absent in qed.

this very dierence will cause the scattering amplitude to reggeize in our case instead of

eikonalize as we will show below.

to restore lorentz invariance, we can rewrite eq.(17) in terms of the mandelstam

variable s,

 notice that p1  (2c1v)2 is purely imaginary for v > 1/2c1  0.6, resulting in a sup-
pression of the scattering amplitude at large s. this happens because the central
part of the string moves into the ads space with a velocity  2c1v > 1, which is clas-
sically forbidden by the 5 dimensional kinematics. this is a aw of the instantaneous

approximation we discussed above, that can be ultimately resolved by an analytical

or numerical investigation of the exact solution to the minimal surface problem. here,

we observe that this pathology can be removed by physical arguments on the cft

side. indeed, from (19) we note that the pathological behavior of the string yields a

new branch-point singularity in the s-channel, besides the expected free threshold at
s = 4m2. in a non-conning and conformally invariant sym theory, this is unphysical.

this singularity disappears if and only if 2c1 is renormalized to 1. this means that

the exact treatment of the minimal surface should yield a result where the maximum

speed of the central point of the string is 1, in accordance with relativity. when this

happens,

(20)

 eq.(16) might be interpreted to suggest using the proper-time d = 1  v2dt instead

of the global varaible t in the nal stage of the calculation. it is important to realize

that if the f ixed time cuto t = 1/ was substituted by a f ixed proper time cuto

then the result would be (20) with the substitution 1/  s/2m. the former (t)

is favored by the string theory calculation of the minimal surface and to compare the

well-known eikonal form in the abelian case such as qed [5, 19] as well as the result

of the perturbative calculation eq.(18). the latter( ) is favored by manifest lorentz

7

invariance and the representation (1-2). the situation is such that string theory

calculation with time cuto gives the gaugy theory results with formalism using the

proper-time. fortunately, whether we use the proper-time or time cuto, both lead

to the same scattering amplitude asymptotically (see below). note that the elastic

amplitude involves typically momenta of order t, so that b  1/t. as a result,

the cross singularity of the two wilson loops at b = 0 [5] is dynamically regulated

for xed mandelstam variable t.

 the minkowski ads/cft approach followed here is subtle. for example, the concept
of a minimum surface is not well dened in a metric with indenite signature. a more

rigorous treatment is to setup the problem in a metric with an euclidean signature

and then perform a wick-rotation of the outcome. we have checked that our present

answer is unchanged by this procedure. the factor i in the exponent of (20) follows

from 1/ve (ve = dx/d te, it = te), which is real with an euclidean signature but

imaginary with a minkowski signature.

using (20), the gauge-invariant combination of the parton-parton scattering ampli-

tude (6) now reads

t (s, t)  4(s)

(1 + i(s)) (cid:18) 2s
(1  i(s))

(22)

a similar behavior follows from a proper time cuto through the substitution 1/ 
s/2m. the result (21) is reminiscent of the qed result [19], but with important dier-
ences. the amplitude has a nonperturbative dependence on g2
y m n , much like the static
potential [11, 12]. the amplitude reggeizes and unitarizes at large s. indeed, asymptoti-
cally (s >> t, m2)

which is real (no inelasticity), independent of the cuto , and with a negative intercept of
0.5. the zero imaginary part and the nonzero intercept are both tied to the the occurrence
of a string in the ads space as is explicit from (17). on the boundary, the receding partons
with momenta s dene a range in rapidity space of the order of ln s. powers of ln s

8

count the number of gluons exchanged in the t-channel. since (23) can be written as

a power series in ln s, it contains terms with an innite number of gluon exchange. a

similar observation was also made by verlinde and verlinde [4] in the process of mapping

high-energy scattering onto a two-dimensional sigma model.

finally, the present arguments also show that at large n and strong g2

y m n , the cross
sections for quark-quark and quark-antiquark scattering are the same. the gluon-gluon
scattering amplitude could be calculated similarly with the substitution n  n 2, due to
the adjoint representation of the gluon.

4. we have presented arguments for evaluating the elastic parton-parton scattering

amplitude at large n and strong g2

y m n in n=4 sym. although the latter is conformally
invariant in m4 the appearance of the string picture and the necessity to regulate the elastic
contribution in time has led to a reggeized behavior that unitarizes at large s. the result
cannot be reached by perturbation theory. the nature of the result depends sensitively on

the string character of the underlying description and hence is not applicable to abelian-like

theories such as qed.

our main result follows from a physically motivated variational estimate of the min-

imal surface in the ads space. the exact form of the extremal surface is too involved to

be written down analytically. although an exact result would of course be ideal, we do not

expect our estimate of the parton-parton cross section to change appreciably. indeed, the

dominant contributions arise from scattering with large impact parameter b  1/t, for

which our approximation for the extremal surface should be legitimate. for a large impact

parameter b, the extremal surface is smoothly twisted and the eikonal approximation is also

good.

finally and from a dierent standpoint, verlinde and verlinde [4] have shown that
at large s the elastic amplitudes in qcd follows from a two-dimensional sigma model
with conformal symmetry, where the latter is broken when the light-like quark lines are

regulated in the time-like direction. does the large n eective action derived by verlinde

and verlinde [4] map onto an ads type action? is there a way to do better than the

variational estimate made in the present analysis? how could we recover the true regge

behavior of non-supersymmetric qcd? some of these questions will be addressed in a

forthcoming publication.
