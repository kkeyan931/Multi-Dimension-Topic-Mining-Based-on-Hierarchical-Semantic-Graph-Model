abstract

twisted sectors solutions to the equations of motion with non-trivial
monodromies of three dimensional euclidean gravity are studied. we argue
that upon quantization this new sector of the theory provides the necessary
(and no more) degrees of freedom to account for the bekenstein-hawking en-
tropy of three-dimensional black holes.

i. introduction

the asymptotic form of three-dimensional anti-de sitter space,

ds2  r2dwd w +

dr2
r2 ,

(1)

enjoys remarkable properties. (here w is a complex coordinate related to the spacetime real
coordinates t and  by,

w =  + it.

(2)

note that we work in the euclidean sector.) the most general set of dieomorphism leaving
(1) invariant form the conformal group in two dimensions. this symmetry was discovered
by brown and henneaux [1] more than 10 years ago, however, only recently it was realized
[2] (see also [3]) that it plays a central role in the statistical mechanical description of three
dimensional [4,5] black holes.

the metric (1) is a solution to einstein equations in three dimensions with a negative
cosmological constant  = 2/l2. the action for euclidean three-dimensional gravity can
be written in the convenient form,

ic[g] =

c

24 z g(r + 2)dx3,

where the constant c is the brown-henneaux central charge [1],

c =

3l
2g

,

1

(3)

(4)

and the coordinates x = x/l are dimensionless. in this paper we shall refer all constants
to c.

the result discovered in [1] states that the asymptotic group of symmetries of (1) is the

conformal group generated by two copies of the virasoro algebra1,

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +

c
12

n(n2  1)n+m,0

(5)

where the central charge c is the parameter appearing in the action (3).

the rst attempt to relate the conformal properties of asymptotic anti-de sitter space
with quantum black holes was done in [7]. it was pointed out in that reference that the
degeneracy of states treating l0 as a number operator was proportional to the black hole
area but with a dierent coecient. strominger [2] made the striking observation that if one
regards the conformal algebra as being generated by a 1+1 unitary conformal eld theory,
as suggested by the ads/cft correspondence [810], then the degeneracy of states for large
values of l0 and l0 is exactly equal to the bekenstein-hawking entropy for the corresponding
black hole with mass ml = l0 + l0  c/12 and spin j = l0  l0. (see [11] and [12] for
recent extensions of this idea to higher dimensions.)
in a purely gravitational calculation (like the one suggested in [7]), the boundary cft
is liouville theory [13] which is a single eld and has an eective central charge equal to

one. this means that the degeneracy of states grows as [14,15] exp(2ql0/6) instead of
the desired cardy form exp(2qcl0/6) which would give the right result. this happens

because, contrary to a system of d free bosons with central charge d and a degeneracy
growing with d, in liouville theory the central charge is related to the coupling, not the
number of elds. accordingly, the degeneracy does not grow with c. in order to have the
right counting one would need to have c liouville elds. this has lead many authors to
conclude that the gravitational degrees of freedom carry only the thermodynamical aspects
of the bekenstein-hawking entropy [1618] (see [19] for an earlier discussion of this idea).

in this paper we will show that if one includes solutions to the equations of motions with
twisted boundary conditions (on the torus) the degeneracy grows and provides the necessary
degrees of freedom to account for the bekenstein-hawking entropy. we will show that the
degeneracy in the twisted sector is,

q(l0) = exp(cid:18)2qql0/6(cid:19)

(6)

where q, the order of the twisting, is a positive integer. on the other hand, unitarity in the
twisted sector will restrict q by c/q  1. thus, the sector with the maximum degeneracy
q = c gives the right bekenstein-hawking value. (note that the sum over q is dominated by
its maximum value q = c.)

1 this form of the virasoro algebra is appropriated to the anti-de sitter sector with sl(2, c)
as an exact symmetry.
in the black hole calculations we shall encounter a shifted zero mode
l
0 = l0  c/24 appropriated to a torus whose exact symmetries are u (1)  u (1) [6], and the
central term will have the n3n+m form.

2

it is important to stress here that the formula (6) has nothing to do with the cardy
formula (which requires modular invariance and unitarity). eq. (6) will follow by counting
states explicitely in a given representation of the virasoro algebra. (in our situation, the
sum over representations give subleading contributions to the degeneracy.)

the results of this paper provide a geometrical justication for the results reported in

[20].

ii. classical solutions in ads3 gravity

in this section we describe the structure of the classical space of solutions (untwisted and

twisted) of three-dimensional anti-de sitter gravity.

a. ads3 and riemann surfaces

the metric (1) with w =  + it is dened on the cylinder because  is an angle. it will
be useful for our purposes to work on the plane. this is achieved by performing a conformal
transformation which also serves as an example to illustrate the conformal properties of (1).
consider the transformation from the cylinder w to the plane z via,

z = eiw(cid:18)1 +

r = ei(w w)/2 r

1

r2 + ...(cid:19)

(7)

it is direct to see that the new metric in the coordinates {z, r} looks, to leading order in
r, exactly like (1). this is an example of the invariance of (1) under a nite conformal
transformation. note that the coordinate r is not invariant under the transformation. in
fact, from (7) we see that r2 transforms like a primary with conformal dimension (1, 1). of
course this is necessary if one expects r2dwd w to be invariant.

it will be convenient to introduce a new radial coordinate  dened as r = e. this

change, plus the conformal transformation (7) bring (1) to the form,

ds2  e2dzdz + d2.

(8)

this asymptotic metric will be our starting point.

the metrics (1) and (8) are actually exact solutions to the eld equations, although their
global properties dier. the metric (1) corresponds to the vacuum black hole [4,5], while
(8) to anti-de sitter space. this can be seen by setting  = 1/r in (1) and  = e in (8).
both metrics are mapped into the upper poincare plane. since  in (1) is compact there
are identications in this case. the corresponding solution is the vacuum black hole. on
the other hand, the coordinate z in (8) lives in the whole complex plane z = x + iy, and the
corresponding solution is anti-de sitter space without any identications. this change in
the topology occurs because in the transition from (1) to (8) via (7) we have kept only the
leading terms, ignoring schwarztian derivative pieces which precisely relate anti-de sitter
space with the vacuum black hole through the shift l0  l0  c/24.
the three dimensional black hole is asymptotically anti-de sitter and it approaches (8)
at innity. in the euclidean sector, the time coordinate is periodic in order to avoid conical

3

singularities, t  t + . the topology in the w plane is a torus with the identications
w  w + 2n + 2m (n, m  z) where  is related to the black hole temperature and
angular velocity [21,22]. in the z-plane this identication reads,

z  e2i z.

(9)

the identication (9) can also be introduced in the anti-de sitter sector and leads to thermal
anti-de sitter space (tads) [23]. in three dimensions, thermal anti-de sitter space is related
to the black hole via a modular transformation [22].

the euclidean sector of three-dimensional anti-de sitter space is particularly interesting
because the mathematics of riemann surfaces is available. one can consider generalizations
of (8) on which the coordinate z is dened on a riemann surface with genus g, and the
conformal group will still act in a natural way. the solutions to the equations of motion can
be summarized in the table,

2d  surface
sphere (g = 0)
torus (g = 1)

3d  solution

ads3

black holes / tads

riemann surface (g > 1)

?

(10)

(note that in each case there may be conical or cusp singularities, if sources are added.)
we shall see that admitting solutions with non-trivial monodromy properties leads to higher
genus solutions, but we shall not discuss this point in any detail. to our knowledge solutions
to the euclidean equations of motion with higher genus (a solid riemann surface) have not
appeared in the literature. (see [24] for a recent discussion about solutions with higher genus
in minkowskian signature.)

b. the untwisted solution

a key property of three-dimensional gravity is the absence of bulk degrees of freedom.
this makes possible to nd the general solution to the equations of motion. under the
boundary conditions (8), the general solution has the form of a travelling wave,

ds2 = f dz2 + f dz2 +(cid:16)e2 + f f e2(cid:17) dzdz + d2,

(11)

where f = f (z) and f = f (z) are arbitrary functions of their arguments [25]. locally,
this metric has constant curvature (as demanded by the vacuum three-dimensional einstein
equations) and, for   , it approaches (8) with the correct fallof behaviour [1].
to prove that (11) is the most general solution we resort to the analysis of [1]. the most
general perturbation of the background metric (8) which preserves its asymptotic structure
is constructed by acting on it with a set of asymptotic conformal vectors  = (, ) which
depend on two arbitrary functions (z) and (z). acting with these vectors on (8) one
produces the solution (11) with,

f (z) =

6
c

t (z),

4

(12)

where c is given in (4). the same formula holds for the anti-holomorphic side. we have
named f (z) as in (12) because the function t (z) transform under the above symmetry as a
virasoro operator. in the following we shall denote the metric (11) as ds2(t, t ).

actually, this construction yield only the pieces linear in f and f of (11) [26]. to obtain
the full exact solution (11) we simply note that the term f f e2dzdz which makes (11)
an exact solution does not aect the leading and rst subleading terms. since three-
dimensional gravity does not have any bulk degrees of freedom, it follows that (11) is the
most general solution with the boundary condition (8).

the construction of (11) by acting on (8) with the conformal generators parallels the
way one constructs representations of the virasoro algebra. the analogue of the vacuum
state |0i is the anti-de sitter background (8) which is sl(2, c) invariant. acting on it with
the conformal generators one nds the general solution (11). the metric (11) is then a
descendant of the metric (8) which is the primary. we shall make this point precise
below in this section and in sec. iii.

generically, the perturbations produced on the anti-de sitter metric (8) via conformal
transformations are dened only locally because, apart from the sl(2, c) transformations
for which (8) is invariant, all other conformal mappings are not globally well-dened. in
this sense, the metric (8) is a background solution whose local perturbations, consistent
with the equations of motion, are described by (11). in other words, since (11) has constant
curvature, it can be obtained from (8) via identications with some discrete group. however,
this discrete subgroup will act freely only on some special cases.

the vacuum metric with t = t = 0 is not the only possible background solution.

there exists a continuum of metrics for which t (z) has the particular form,

t (z) = 
z2 ,

(13)

where  is some constant. these solutions are also globally well-dened and for suitable
values of  they represent black holes. see [25] for the transition from a metric with t (z)
of the form (13) to a 3d black hole of mass m =  +   c/12 and spin j =   . we
shall denote this particular set of solutions as ds2(, ).
before leaving this section, we note that the asymptotic conformal symmetries of (8) can
be lifted to act on the space of solutions (11). let g(t, t ) the metric (11) and x =
{z, z, }. there exists vector elds 
,(x) depending on two arbitrary (anti-) holomorphic
functions (z) ((z)) such that under the change x  x = x + (x) the metric (11)
transform as,

with

g(t, t ) + g = g(t + t, t +  t )

t = t + 2t +

c
12

3,

(14)

(15)

and c is given in (4). see [25] for the explicit form of the residual conformal vectors which,
of course, coincide asymptotically with the vectors found in [1]. this symmetry is an innite
dimensional symmetry of the space of solutions. in the language of representations of the
virasoro algebra, it maps the members of a conformal family into themselves.

5

suppose we start with the metric (8) and perform a nite conformal transformation
z  z(z). the nite form of (15) is known and involves a schwarztian derivative. since
(8) can be regarded as a particular case of (11) for which t (z) = 0, making this nite
transformation will give a solution of the form (11) with t (z) = (c/12){z, z}, where {,}
denotes the schwarztian derivative. dening a(z) = ln(z/z) we nd the liouville type
stress tensor,

t (z) =

c
24

((a)2 + 22a).

(16)

the function a can be identied with the holomorphic function appearing in the general
solution to the liouville equation. see [26] for a related approach to obtain the liouville
stress tensor.

since the residual symmetries of (11) are nothing but changes of coordinates they can be
generated by the constraints of general relativity, supplemented with appropriated boundary
terms.
in the gauge xed form of the space of solutions (11), these generators are the
functions t and t and the associated algebra is the virasoro algebra [1]. in terms of the
modes ln dened in the usual way,

t (z) = xnz

ln
zn+2 ,

(17)

one obtains the algebra (5).

an important property of these transformations is that e is not a scalar. indeed e2 is to
leading order a primary eld with conformal dimension (1, 1) and hence e2dzdz is invariant.
this also explains the presence of the term e2t t in the solution (11). since t and t are
quasi-primaries with conformal dimensions (2, 0) and (0, 2) respectively, the product t t has
dimension (2, 2). the combination e2t t then has dimension (1, 1), as needed.

c. the twisted sector

motivated by the problem of black hole entropy lack of enough states to account for
the large black hole degeneracy, see [15,16,25] for recent discussions our goal in this section
is to generalize the space of solutions described in the last section.

the generalization we have in mind is to admit non-trivial monodromies in the angular
direction. in other words, we consider solutions of the form (11) for which the function f (z)
has the property,

f (e2iz) = g  f (z),

(18)

where g is a symmetry of the space of solutions. in sec. iii we shall make this notation
precise. for the time being, we consider functions f (z) which have fractional powers in the
variable z. on the torus (black hole) the angular cycle is non-contractible and thus the
twisting does not introduce singularities. on the sphere (ads) there will be two singularities
in the north and south poles of the riemann sphere.

we shall argue in sec. iv c that in the chern-simons formulation of three-dimensional

gravity the twisted solutions arise in a completely natural way.

6

we consider the solution (11) with a mode expansion for f (z) having fractional powers
of z. let q be a non-negative integer, which will be called the order of the twisting. we
replace (12) with

where

f (z) =

6
c

qt (z)

t (z) =

1
q

q1

xr=0 xmz

lm+r/q
zn+r/q+2 .

(19)

(20)

the factors q and 1/q appearing in (19) and (20) are conventional and included for future
convenience. similar formulae are assumed for the anti-holomorphic factor. the stress
tensor t (z) is a nite sum of the form,

qt (z) = t0(z) + t1(z) +    + tq1(z),

(21)

where tr(e2iz) = e2ir/qtr(z). clearly t0(z) corresponds to the untwisted solution men-
tioned in the previous paragraph. the parameter q is regarded as a new degree of freedom
in the theory and we shall sum over it.

the modes ln+r/q can be inverted in terms of t (z) in two steps. first we note that tr

can be expressed in terms of t as,

tr(z) =

q1

xs=0

t (e2s)e2isr/q,

and the modes ln+r/q are given in terms of tr as,

ln+r/q = i dz

2i

zn+r/q+1tr(z).

(22)

(23)

the metric (11) is still an exact solution because the eld equations only see the local
properties. for the same reason, the modes lm+r/q satisfy the same virasoro algebra (5)
but now the label n in (5) takes values on z + r/q. one nds the twisted virasoro algebra,

[ln+r/q, lm+s/q] = (n  m + (r  s)/q)ln+m+(r+s)/q

c
12

(n + r/q)[(n + r/q)2  1]n+m+(r+s)/q.
this algebra has appeared in [27] in the context of cyclic orbifolds [28].

+

(24)

note that the modes ln+r/q are dened such that 0  r < q. the algebra (24) should

be understood with the periodicity and reality conditions

ln+(r+q)/q = ln+1+r/q,

lnr/q = ln1+(qr)/q,
l

n+r/q = lnr/q.

7

(25)
(26)

(27)

the algebra (24) has a virasoro sub-algebra (for r = 0) generating the single-valued confor-
mal transformations of z with central charge c. it is clear that this sub-algebra is isomorphic
to the brown-henneaux generators ln acting on the single valued, or untwisted, sector.

there is an important point here concerning the value of the central charge appearing in
(24). if one computes the algebra, or ope of the function t (z) dened in (20) using (24),
one nds a central charge c/q. this is correct. the function t (z) contains all sectors tr(z),
r = 0, 1, .., q  1. it is the trivial monodromy generator t0(z) what needs to be matched
with the brown-henneaux one, not the full t (z). t0(z) denes a subalgebra of the full t (z)
and satisfy the virasoro algebra with central charge c, as desired. this point will have an
important consequence below.

the perturbed metric (11), for a general t (z) with twisted contributions, is no longer
periodic under z  e2iz. for the purposes of this paper, this classical non-periodicity will be
of no importance because, as we discussed above, the only globally dened metrics are those
for which t (z) is of the form (13), for some value of . these metrics are clearly periodic.
the constant  (equal to the conformal dimension of the state) is made up of periodic and
non-periodic perturbations, but the observable globally dened metric is periodic. we shall
come back to this point in the next section.

iii. quantization.

the goal of this section is to study the quantum version of the space of solutions described

in the last section.

a. the spectrum.

the space of solution described by metrics of the form (11) is innite dimensional, and
so far, completely disorganized. any function f (z), say f (z) = z3 or f (z) = z1/2, provides
a solution and there is no way to predetermine their physical properties.

since there exists a virasoro symmetry acting on (11) mapping solutions into solutions,
one can classify the solutions using the representations of the virasoro algebra. in particular,
this will enable us to select the physically reasonable ones, e.g., with positive energy.

the idea is to nd a map from the vectors in the representation space of the virasoro
algebra, and the space of solutions (11) [25]. we start by identifying the metric associated
to the vacuum state |0i. there is a unique candidate to represent this state, namely the
anti-de sitter metric (8).
as we mentioned in sec. ii a, the metric (8) is an exact solution to the eld equations.
in fact, it represents euclidean anti-de sitter space without any identications. the metric
(8) is invariant under global sl(2, c) transformations and it is a particular case of (11) on
which t and t are equal to zero. we are then led to the identication,

|0i  ds2(0, 0) = e2dzdz + d2.

(28)

the next step is to identify the primaries from which all other representations will be

constructed.

8

other globally well-dened solutions are those for which t (z) is of the form (13). con-
sider the metric (11) with f (z) given in (19) and qt = h/z2 where h is a positive real number
(the same for the anti-holomorphic side). we denote this metric as ds2(h, h). we identify
the primary elds |h, hi with the background solutions of the form (13),

|h, hi  ds2(h, h).

(29)

the metrics ds2(h, h) are isometric to black holes or conical singularities [29], depending
on the values of h and h [25]. in other words, the three-dimensional topologies associated
to ds2(h, h) depend on the values of h and h. in complete analogy with liouville theory,
the conformal dimensions of the primaries h and h are separated in various sectors (see also
[16,30,31]):

h = h = 0
0 < h + h < c/12,
h = h = c/24
h + h > c/12,

anti-de sitter space
conical singularities
vacuum black hole
black holes

(30)

having dened the primaries, a full representation is constructed by acting with the confor-
mal generators.

the above construction can be summarized and completed by the single formula

t(z) = h| t (z)|i,

(31)

where |i is any normalized state in a given representation of the virasoro algebra.
we identify the function t (z) appearing in (11) with the expectation value of the quan-
tized operator t on a given state |i; t (z) = t(z). in other words, instead of considering
(11) with arbitrary values for t (z), we consider only those functions t(z) which are the
expectation values of the quantised t (z) on some state |i. this still leaves an innite
dimensional space of solutions, but they are now nicely organized according the the repre-
sentations of the virasoro algebra. in particular, if we only consider unitary representations,
positivity of the adm mass is guaranteed.

note that since conformal transformations acting on the state |i produce conformal
transformations on t(z) of the form (15), the identication (31) implements correctly the
mapping of solutions into solutions via (15).
indeed, consider an innitesimal conformal
transformation z  z + (z). this transformation has an associated group element u =
1 + ih (z)t (z) acting on the representation space: |i  |i = u|i. it is direct to see
that the eect of this transformation on t is exactly equivalent to (15).
the map (31) can be extended to the full metric. we extend the above analysis to the
anti-de holomorphic sector. to each state in the full fock space |i there is a corresponding
solution to the equations of motion [25],

ds2

 = h|ds2|i,

(32)

where ds2 is the metric (11) on which t and t have been replaced by their quantized versions
t and t . note that the metric (11) does not involve products of non-commuting operators

9

2 and thus is well-dened as an operator.

the statistical mechanical picture which follows from the above analysis is the following.
we construct the representations of the twisted virasoro algebra (24). then we seek (and
count) those states which under the map (32) yield a black hole with a given mass and spin.
we shall show that the number of these states is enough to account for the bekenstein-
hawking degeneracy.

before going to the representations of the algebra (24), let us study the eect of the

twisting on the quantum metric. from the algebra (24) it is direct to prove the identity,

e(n+r/q)ln+r/q = el0ln+r/q el0,

(33)

where  is a complex number3. using this formula with  = 2i one can check that t (z)
given in (20) transforms as (here t (z) = t (z)dz2 is understood as a quadratic dierential),

t (e2iz) = a t (z) a1,

where a = e2il0 is the generator of the cycle,

z  e2iz,

acting on fock space. in this sense the metric (11) as an operator is well-dened.

the classical function t(z) appearing in the classical solution (11) transforms as,

where  is the transported state,

t(e2iz) = t(z),

|i  |i = e2il0|i.

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

the particular set of states for which t is invariant under (37), t = t, yield a well-
dened univalued metric. these states are those for which l0 is diagonal because the
transportation (37) gives a phase not seen by the expectation value t(z) = h|t (z)|i.
as expected, the classical solutions associated to these states are the globally well-dened
metrics with t (z) given in (13).

2this property will not survive in a full gauge invariant quantization. note, however, that in a
chern-simons formulation one would need to regulate at most a quadratic function of the currents
(sugawara type).

3the proof is as follows. we consider x() = el0 ln+r/q el0. using the algebra (24) it is
direct to see that x satises the dierential equation dx/d = (n + r/q)x whose solution is
x = e(n+r/q)x0. the constant x0 does not depend on  and thus can be evaluated on  = 0
yielding x0 = ln+r/q.

10

b. black hole states

the space of states which diagonalize l0 are those in the verma module, or linear com-
binations of them at a given level. these states have the extra property that the associated
classical metric, through (32), is univalued and isometric to a black hole [25] with a mass
and spin given by

m = l

0 + l

0

j = l

0  l
0,

(38)

where l

0 = l0  c/24 (see footnote 1).

we shall now count the number of states compatible with a given value of l

0 in a
representation created by a primary |hi of the twisted algebra (24). since we are interested
in the microscopic structure of black holes, we take as primary state the vacuum black hole
with h = c/24 and l
0 = 0. there is a subtle issue here because the vacuum black hole does
not have the same topology as the massive black hole. we shall imagine that the primary is
arbitrarily close to be a vacuum black hole, but its topology will be that of a massive black
hole: a solid torus. in particular, the boundary described by the coordinate z is a torus.

for h = c/24 and c > 1 (and q  c, see below), the representations of (24) are unitary

and irreducible. the excited levels are given by the states

|ni, rii = ln1+r1/q    lns+rs/q|c/24i

(39)

where ni = 1, 2, 3, ... and ri = 0, 1, 2, ..., q 1. these states satisfy (assuming they have been
normalized),

n0
hni, ri|ln+q/r|ni, rii = 0

r l0.

(40)

the associated metric, through (32), is then univalued and globally dened with t (z) of the
form (13) and  = l0.
given by,

from (24), we deduce that l0 is a number operator and its value on the state |ni, rii is

l
0 := l0 

c
24

=

s

xi=1

(ni  ri/q).

(41)

note that since we take the vacuum black hole as background metric with h = c/24, there
is a direct relation between the excited levels and l
0 which is the quantity related directly
to the black hole mass and spin, as in (38), with no added constants.

the sum over ni in (41) is the contribution from the untwisted sector which we know
does not give the right degeneracy. the second piece ri/q provides a hyperne structure
which increases the degeneracy.

eq. (41) can be rewritten in the form,

ql

0 = xi

mi,

with

mi = qni  ri.

(42)

the number of states compatible with a given value of l0 is given by the number of combi-
nations of the pair ni, ri such that (42) is satised.

11

in what follows, the following (trivial) lemma will be of great help. let n  z and

0  r < q:

the map: {n, r}  m = qn  r
is one to one (and invertible).

(43)

given any m  z there exists a unique pair {n, r} such that m = qnr. then, it follows that
all posible combinations of {ni, ri} give all possible positive integers mi once. the problem
of how many states varying ni and ri can exist for a given l
0 can then be formulated as
the number of ways that the integer ql
0 can be written as a sum of integers mi. this is of
course given by the ramanujan formula,

  e2ql

0/6,

(44)

which is valid for large values of ql
0. since q is
an integer greater than one, the degeneracy has certainly grown with respect to the pure
liouville calculation which has an aective central charge equal to one. the key step in this
counting is that even though l

0. note the factor of q multiplying l

0 is not an integer, the combination ql

0 is.

if we choose q = c, then (44) gives the expected value for the black hole entropy [2]. thus,
in principle, we have enough states but this is certainly not satisfactory. we would like to
prove that q must not exceed c. we shall now argue that for integer values of the brown-
henneaux central charge c, unitarity in the representations of the algebra (24) restricts the
possible twistings and q must indeed lie in the range,

1  q  c.

(45)

thus, q = c is the sector with the maximum degeneracy (maximum twisting) and yield the
correct bekenstein-hawking value. (note that the sum over q is dominated by the highest
twisting sector q = c.)

this condition arises from a re-ordering of the generators ln+r/q  qm (m  z) given

by,

ln+r/q =

1
q

qqn+r.

(46)

this is a purely algebraic step. we choose to enumerate the ls by integers subscripts
according to (46). a geometrical interpretation for the qs (on the sphere) will be given in
next section.

in view of (43), it is evident that the map (46) is one to one. the set of all qn with
n  z contains all ln+r/q and viceversa. some examples of the above transformation are:
q0 = ql0, q1 = ql1/q, qq = ql1, etc. the transformation (46) is a particular case of a
general procedure studied in [27].

the algebra of the modes qn can be computed directly from the algebra (24) and yields,

[qn, qm] = (n  m)qn+m +

c/q
12

n(n2  q2)n+m.

(47)

this algebra, up to a shift in the zero mode q0 that we discuss below, is a virasoro algebra
with central charge c/q.

12

it should now be clear where does condition (45) comes from. unitary representations

for (47) exist only for c/q  1 thus leading to (45).
unitarity is also achieved for a central charge c/q smaller than one provided it has the
kac form c/q = 1  6/((m + 2)(m + 3)) with m = 0, 1, 2, ... this condition yields a strange
quantization condition for c, and thus for newtons constant. the degeneracy in this case is
more complicated to determined because there are null states in the verma module. most
likely, the counting will still give the correct degeneracy provided one includes all conformal
dimensions producing a modular invariant partition function and using the cardy formula.

we shall not consider this situation here.

since the central charge is c/q and q0 = ql0, one would have q(c/q)q0 = cl0, as desired.
the form of the central term in (47) may seem strange. note that the transformation
(46) maps l0, l1 into q0, qq generating an sl(q)(2,) sub-algebra. let us shift q0 such
that the central term in (47) acquires the usual form with q0, q1 generating an sl(2,)
algebra. this is achieved by redening the new qnew

,

0

qnew
0 = q0 

c

24  q 

1

q! .

(48)

let us take the sector q = c. in terms of this new zero mode, unitary representations for
(47) exists provided qnew

0  0. from (48) and (46) we obtain the bound for l0

l0 

c
24

24c

.

(49)

for c large the rst term dominates and this is the condition that eliminates (almost all)
conical singularities leaving only black holes in the spectrum.

iv. remarks

we have exhibit in this note a set of solutions to the vacuum einstein equations which
upon quantization yield the correct bekenstein-hawking entropy. in order to have a complete
picture of the hawking evaporation process, we should consider also transitions between
states i.e., emissions of states. this type of process will certainly need other correlation
functions beyond the partition function. we shall not consider this problem here. however,
we would like to end by making a number of remarks which hopefully will clarify the nature
of the solutions that we have presented (at least on the sphere), and may be the starting
point towards a dynamical modeling of the evaporation process in 2+1 dimensions.

in particular, in section iv c, we shall argue that the multivalued solutions twisted
sector arise in a natural way within the chern-simons formulation of three-dimensional
gravity.

a. the conformal algebra in the covering space

working with multivalued functions is often problematic and thus it is convenient to
pass to the covering space on which the stress tensor is single valued. it is well-known in
the theory of complex variables that for any multivalued function of a complex coordinate

13

z, there exists a covering surface for which the given function is single valued. in our case
this covering is simply given by the equation

z = uq.

(50)

this transformation map the riemann sphere (ads3) into itself (up to two singularities in
the north and south poles where (50) has xed points). for the torus, this transformation
changes the genus [32]. since we do not have much control on the three-dimensional solutions
with higher genus 2d-boundaries, we shall restrict ourselves in this section to the genus zero
situation.

we consider the metric (11) with f given in (19) and t in (20). let us transform this
metric with (50). two clarications are necessary here. first, we shall only transform the
complex coordinate z, not the radial coordinate. this means that this transformation is
not one of the residual transformations mentioned before and we will obtain a dierent
metric. we could modify (50) including a radial dependence plus adding the corresponding
transformations for  and obtain the same metric dened on the covering space. for our
purposes here this is not necessary and would bring unnecessary complications. second,
we shall treat t classically and therefore we do not include any schwarztian derivative
terms. of course, if we did include the radial reparametrization, there would be the classical
schwarztian derivative piece.

so, we simply plug (50) into (11) and nd the new metric

ds2 = f du2 + fdu2 + q2|u|2q2 e2 +

f fe2

q2|u|2q2! dudu + d2

with

f (u) =

6q
c

q(u).

(51)

(52)

a similar formula is valid for the anti-holomorphic side. the eld q is simply the conformally
transformed version of t under (50),

t (uq)

u!2
q(u) =   z
=: xnz

qn
un+2

(53)

and is single valued. the modes qn are related to the modes of t as 4

4here we have used the monodromy decomposition:

cn
xn/q =

xnz

q1

xr=0 xmz

cmq+r
xm+r/q .

14

ln+r/q =

1
q

qqn+r.

(54)

these are exactly the generators introduced in sec.
iii (see eq. (46)) which satisfy the
virasoro algebra (47) with central charge c/q . in this context they appear as generators of
the conformal symmetry acting on the covering space.

the metric (51) is an exact solution to the equations of motion and it is single-valued.
however, it does not satisfy the boundary conditions (8). we shall see in sec. iv c that
working in the chern-simons formulation one can easily deal with metrics of the form (51).
how do we recover from (47), the original brown-henneaux algebra? the virasoro

algebra (47) has the symmetry

qn  e2in/qqn.

(55)

it is direct to see that the subalgebra of the qs invariant under (55) is generated by the
subset of generators

ln =

1
q

qqn

(56)

and have central charge c. the sub-algebra spanned by the lns generates the single-valued
conformal transformations acting on z = uq. thus, they correspond to the brown-henneaux
generators.

this can also be seen as follows. we start with (53) and act on this operator with the

transformation (55),

q(u)du2 = x

qn

un+2 du2  x

e2in/qqn

un+2

du2 = q(e2i/qu)du2

thus, (55) act on the plane u as

and the invariant coordinate is, as expected, z = uq.

u  e2i/qu,

(57)

(58)

b. the action in the covering space

we have considered twisted solutions to the equations of motion associated to the action
(3), with the boundary condition (8). as shown in the last section, instead of working with
a multivalued function t , one can work with a single valued function dened on a dierent
space.
in this section we study the action on that space. this shed some light on the
reduction in the central charge in the covering space algebra. due to conformal invariance,
the action in the covering space has the same local form as the action in the original space.
however, since the plane u covers q times the original plane z, the coupling constant in the
covering manifold is c/q instead of c.

this can be summarised in the following table.

15

physical spacetime: z covering: u = z1/q

c

24 zz
(r + 2)

{ln+r/q, c}

c/q

24 zu
(r + 2)

{qn,

c
q}

(59)

it is useful to read this table backwards, from right to left. if we restrict the action in the
covering space to the space of functions invariant under (58) it reduces to an action of single
valued functions with coupling c (recall that the sphere u covers q times the sphere z). this
is our starting point and shows that the coupling c/q in the upper right corner is correct.
in the same way, as showed in the last section, the generators qn acting on the invariant
subspace reduce to the lns (r = 0).

this analysis posses the question of what is the coupling constant of general relativity.
in principle, the action in the plane z is not preferable in any form with respect to the
action in the plane u. we could then argue that c/q should be related to newtons instead
of c. the answer to this ambiguity, as in four dimensional gravity, is found in the boundary
conditions. we dene the action in the plane z with the boundary conditions (8) as the
physical action. the transformation (50) changes the boundary conditions.

c. chern-simons formulation and the value of the coupling

the chern-simons formulation provides a natural motivation to look for multivalued
solutions to the equations of motion. putting the argument the other way around, within
the chern-simons formulation, the most natural solution to the equations of motion is (51),
of which (11) is only a particular case. thus, when making the conformal transformation (50)
that brings (51) to the asymptotic form (8), one nds the multi-valued solutions introduced
above.

we consider here euclidean three-dimensional gravity formulated as a chern-simons
theory [33,34] for the group sl(2, c). the level of the chern-simons theory will be xed
below.

the chern-simons action appropriated to the black hole problem is the covariant one

[21,35] supplemented by the chiral boundary conditions,

aa

z = 0,

aa

z = 0.

(60)

recall that aa = wa + iea. at the boundary, the real and imaginary parts of aa are linked
by (60). the non-zero components az and az can be written as [25],

aa

z = 2wa
z ,

aa

z = 2wa
z .

(61)

thus, (60) reduces the sl(2, c) gauge eld at the boundary to two real currents aa
satisfying the ane su(2) algebra at level k.

z and aa

z

conditions (60) are not enough to ensure anti-de sitter asymptotics [13].

let
{a+, a, a3} and { a+, a, a3} the components of the su(2)k  su(2)k ane currents at
the boundary (we omit here the subscripts z and z). to ensure that the associated metric is

16

asymptotically anti-de sitter, as in (8), the boundary conditions (60) must be supplemented
with the reduction conditions [13] (see [36] for a dierent approach)

a+ = 1,
a3 = 0,

a = 1,
a3 = 0.

(62)
(63)

this leaves only l := a/k and l := a+/k as arbitrary functions. it follows [37] that the
ane su(2)k algebra reduced by (62) and (63) yields for l and l the virasoro algebra with
central charge5 c = 6k. identifying the level k with the usual value k = l/4g yields c = 3l/2g
and conrms that the generators l = a/k and l = a+/k are the brown-henneaux ones.
as a motivation to a more general situation consider imposing only (63). the leading

piece in the metric with these boundary conditions is easily computed and yields,

ds2  e2a+(u) a(u)dudu + d2.

(64)

it is clear that further restricting the gauge eld with (62) leads to (8). however, if we
keep them as arbitrary, but xed, functions we discover that (64) is precisely the asymptotic
behaviour of (51) with

a+ = quq1,

a = quq1

(65)

thus, the chern-simons formulation leads to (51) in natural way.

it should be clear that, from the point of view of the chern-simons formulation, there is
no a priori reason to select the boundary (8) instead of (64). the non trivial point is that in
the transition from (64) to (8) via z = uq, we have kept the twisted states, i.e., all branches
of z1/q, by letting t (z) to be a multivalued function. this is the step that follows naturally
in the chern-simons formulation because there is no reason a priori to set q = 1 in (65).
the multivaluedness of t (z) is then a simple consequence of the more general boundary
conditions in the covering space.

the next question is what is the algebra leaving (64) invariant. as a direct generalization
of the above case, one can prove that the restriction of the ane su(2)k algebra via (63) and
(65) lead for the combination q(u) := (1/k)a+a = (q/k)uq1a(u) the virasoro algebra
with a central charge c = 6k. in this case, however, it is not correct to identify q with the
original brown-henneaux generators l, nor the central term 6k with the central charge (4).
the generators q are the operators introduced in sec. (iv a), acting on the covering space
with central charge c/q, and leave invariant the generalized boundary conditions (64). we
are then led to identify the level k as,

6kq = c =

3l
2g

(66)

in order to match the center of the algebra (47). note also that this is in agreement with
(59). the above chern-simons theory, with the boundary conditions (64), is appropriated
to the action in the covering space with coupling k = c/6q.

5in [25], the central charge was written as c = 6k. this sign can be changed by a dierent
orientation for the modes. note that the virasoro algebra is invariant under ln  ln and
c  c. the following discussion is only a qualitative analysis and this sign is irrelevant.

17

this issue brings in a problem of interpretation for the calculations of partitions functions
that have been done using the chern-simons formulation, and its connection to chiral wzw
models [38,21]. the main assumption on this type of calculation is to quantize the full gauge
eld aa without imposing and kind of reduction conditions. however, as we have emphasized
above, the values of a+ and a change the global properties of the spacetime. the coupling
k is not only related to newtons constant but also to the wrapping of the cover space into
spacetime.

there is another curious consequence of (66). when quantising a string theory on the
ads3 background, a formula can be given for the spacetime conformal generators [18]. the
associated central charge is c = 6kstp where kst = l2/l2
st is the coupling of the sl(2,) wzw
model, p is the winding number of the spacetime coordinate x() in the worldsheet, and lst
is the string length. newtons constant g3 was associated in [18] to the winding number p
via

6kstp =

3l
2g3

.

(67)

the similarity between (66) and (67) makes it tempting to identify k  kst and q  p. this
amounts to identify the black hole boundary coordinate z(u) with the string worldsheet
coordinate x() (compactied on a circle), i.e., treating the covering coordinate as a string
worldsheet. the fact that in the quantum gravity approach one quantizes functions of z and
thus it corresponds to string eld theory has recently been discussed in [39]. further, we note
that in the sector with the maximum degeneracy c = q (see sec. iii), k is of the order of one
which is also the value of kst is one expects the correspondence principle [40] between black
holes and string states [41] to work in three dimensions. finally, the degrees of freedom of
three-dimensional gravity, as formulated in [13], are described by a (constrained) non-chiral
sl(2,) wzw model at level k. following this line of reasoning, it would be nice to see
an explicit connection between the counting presented in section iii, and the string theory
approach to black holes.
