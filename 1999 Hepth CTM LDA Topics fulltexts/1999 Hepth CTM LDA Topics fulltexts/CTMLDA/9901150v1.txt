abstract

we construct new f-theory vacua in 8-dimensions. they are coming by projective
realizations of f-theory on k3 surfaces admitting double cover onto p2, branched along
a plane sextic curve, the so called double sextics. the new vacua are associated with
singular k3 surfaces. in this way the stable picture of the heterotic string is mapped at
the triple points of the sextic. we argue that this formulation incorporates naturally
the sp(4, z) invariance that the extrapolating four dimensional vector multiplet sector
of all heterotic vacua may possess. in addition, we describe the way that the 4d g=2
description of (0,2) moduli dependence of n = 1 gauge coupling constants may be
connected to riemmann surfaces, with natural sp(4, z) duality invariance. here we
recover a novel way to break space-time supersymmetry and x the moduli parame-
ters in the presence of wilson lines. in the context of arithmetic of torsion points on
elliptic curves, we describe in detail, the derivation of the elliptic brations in weier-
strass form. we also consider the heterotic duals to compactications of f-theory in
four dimensions belonging to isomorphic classes of elliptic curves with points-cusps of
order two. for the latter theories, we calculate the n = 2 4d heterotic prepotential
ft t t corresponding to 0(2)t  o(2)u classical perturbative duality group and their
conjugate modular theories.

introduction and motivation

at the current state of the art the ve perturbative string theories (psts) together with
m-, f- theories, of the same underlying theory, m- of f-theory. in this way, dierent choise
of formulations of unied theories at dierent directions in the moduli space are being used
to derive novel features than could not be seen, easily, by the use of another unied theory.
thus, it appears that problems like that of the correct prediction of newton constant may
be solved in four dimensional compactications if m-theory is used [2]. on the other hand,
f-theory compactications [7, 8] are used to examine the appearance of non-perturbative
gauge symmetries for the heterotic string. the common principle in the examination of
consistency of the compactications involved is that they all correctly reproduce, via duality,
the weak coupling expansion of the heterotic string in four dimensions. on the other hand,
4d n = 1 perturbative heterotic string vacua and their eleven dimensional compactication
extensions in four dimensions are considered to be phenomenologically promising. howerer,
the n = 1 4d eective supergravity vacua of its low energy modes are dened in terms
of three quantities, namely the kahler potential k, the superpotential w, and the gauge
kinetic function f, which appear as too many. instead we would prefer to have a theory
that everything could be dened in terms of only one quantity.
is there such a theory?
in 4d n = 2 eective low energy supergravity theories, the vector
the answer is yes.
multiplet sector of the theory, in its coulomb phase, is dened in terms of one quantity, the
holomorphic prepotential f.

however, there is a general weakness in the way we take into account quantum correc-
tions. that is the quantum theory when loop corrections are taken, or not, into account is
not dened so that it is manifestly sp(4, z) invariant. let us explain this in more detail.
take for example the four dimensional compactications of the heterotic string on a k3t 2.
the 4d theory has n = 2 supersymmetry and originates from further toroidally compacti-
ed the n = 1 d = 6 heterotic vacua which in turn are dual to f-theory compactied on a
calabi-yau 3-fold on an fn base. the vector multiplet eective action, all the couplings in
the eective lagrangian, is xed completely, in perturbation theory, by the knowledge 1 of
the holomorphic prepotential f . in turn, the kahler potential is dened via the use of the
special geometry by the holomorphic symplectic vectors  = (x i(m i ), fi(x)), dependent
on the moduli elds m i , as

k =  log(i  0

1

1 0 ! ) = log(i x ifi  ix i f i), i = 0, . . . , n.

(1)

the target-space duality transformations act on the space of those vectors as sp(2n + 2, r)
transformations on the period vector . alternatively k can be expressed [10] in terms of
the t, u neutral moduli and the wilson lines b, c of the t 2 torus as

k = log[(t + t )(u + u )  (b + c)( b + c)] = det(m  m),

where

1the equations which determine directly the one loop correction to the prepotential f of any n = 2

d = 4 heterotic vacuum for rank three (s-t), and four (s-t-u) models were given in [9].

m =   t b

c b ! .

(2)

(3)

in the latter case the eective theory of light modes is invariant, if we ignore the gravitational
sector contribution of the dilaton and graviphoton, due to the presence of the discrete shifts
in the theta angle at the quantum level, under the target space modular group sp(2r; z).
here r is the number of moduli. in our case r = 2 and sp(2r; z) acts as

m    a b

c d ! m,

  a b
c d !  sp(4; z).

(4)

however, the calculation of the quantum corrections e.g the one loop corrections to the
gauge or gravitational couplings, the n = 2 prepotential, are determined in terms of the
basis for modular forms for the group sl(2, z) and the sl(2, z) j-invariant and not those
associated with sp(4, z).

the question that now arises is if the theories involved in the compactications of the ve
perturbative string theories, including m, f-theories, with quantum eects may be dened
so that they are manifestly sp(4, z) invariant? putting the question dierently, can we
express the quantum corrections in terms of sp(4, z) entities like the basis 2 of modular
forms for the group sp(4, z), making the sp(4, z) invariance manifest? note that we
wish to dene the dierent unied theories in terms of riemmann surfaces having sp(4, z)
invariance. obviously, the answer to our question is negative. apart from some exceptions
unied theories are dened with no manifest sp(4, z) invariance. previous attempts of
description of quantum eects where the ring of modular forms for the sp(4, z) is used are
evident in some works. in [10] the moduli dependence of the one loop corrections to the
gauge coupling constants in 4d n = 1 orbifold compactications of the heterotic string was
translated from the language of the basis of modular forms for the sl(2, z) on the basis of
modular forms for sp(4, z). in [11] the calculation of the degeneracy of n = 4 bps states
was dened in terms of genus 2 theta functions. however, an apparent question remains on
those approaches. namely, which is the riemmann surface where the vector moduli of the
so(3, 2) t2 torus live? the latter question is meaningful both in the context of heterotic
string [10] and in the context of f-theory.

take for example the f-theory/heterotic duality in 8-dimensions [7]. here, compacti-
cations of f-theory on a k3 which admits an elliptic bration with a section is on the same
moduli space so(18, 2; z)\so(18, 2)/so(18) so(2), as the e8  e8 heterotic string on
a t 2 torus. the elliptic bration with a section, represented by dening a torus with a p1
base, represents the f theory dual to the e8  e8 heterotic string is given by two parameter
(, ) family with base coordinate z, as

y2 = x3 + z4x + (z5 + z6 + z7).

(5)

because the torus is a genus one curve the map between the parameters (, ) and the
complex structure parameters of the t 2 torus, namely (, ), is expressed in terms of the j-
invariant, the modular function for the torus [12]. as a result at the quantum level the basic
quantities of the heterotic string are dened in terms of the inherited f-theory j-invariant.
note that at the large  limit the complex structure  of the t 2 of the heterotic string is

2the latter entities are made of the usual modular forms for the sl(2, z) modular group e4, e6 and

the cusp forms c10, c12.

2

identied with the complex structure of the elliptic ber (5), the lacking sp(4, z) invariance
is eminent through all the f-theory formulation.

there is another area however, when the question of the riemmann surface with sp(4, z)
invariance is meaningful. take for example n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills. at the
coulomb phase in four dimensions the modular space of the r vector multiplets, when
charged hypermultiplet matter is not present, is invariant under sp(4r; z). the n = 2
su(r + 1)theory is associated with genus r riemmann surfaces. the n = 2 su(2) theory
is described by a genus 1 surface, n = 2 su(3) with genus 2 and so on. uniqueness and
universality is lost as for r > 1, the theory instead of being simpler, as the gauge group
increases and the number of wilson lines that break the initial observable e8 gauge group
decreases, it is dened on even higher genus surfaces. instead we require in this work that
we want to describe 8d f-theory realizations in terms of double covers of k3 brations that
are branched always along a xed form plane curve, the double sextic. in the latter sence
we always work with the universal form sextic curve.

in section 2, we describe the connection of the mordell-weyl group to the existence of
weierstrass form of rational elliptic surfaces with a section. we give explicitly the derivation
of the weierstrass models for the various forms of torsion subgroups. these weierstrass mod-
els as rational elliptic surfaces will be used in the next section to understand the equivalence
between k3 surfaces admitting elliptic bration and maximizing sextics at the degeneration
limit of the f-theory/heterotic duality limit. in section 3, we describe the representation
of k3 surfaces as double covers onto p2 branched along a plane sextic and its connection
to 8d f-theory/heterotic duality. in addition, we explain the correspondence of the plane
sextics to the extremal elliptic brations. in section 4, we discuss the riemmann surfaces
appearing in genus two and are connected to the calculations of moduli dependence of the
one loop gauge couplings for non-vanishing background elds in four dimensional heterotic
(0, 2) string compactications. in section 5, we present our results for the n = 2 4d het-
erotic theories which exhibit target space modular group o(2)t  o(2)u . these theories
may come from further compactication on a k3 of 8d f-theory compactications with
z2 torsion subgroup or from toroidal compactication of the 6d f-theory on a calabi-yau
3-fold over a 2d base.

2 rational points on elliptic curves

in this section we will explain the appearance of the mordell-weyl group in 8-dimensional
compactications of f-theory, realised on elliptically bered k3 surfaces. we will partic-
ularly explore, one side of the iceberg, namely representations of k3 surfaces which are
realised on genus one curves, those admitting elliptic bration with a section. we are par-
ticularly interested in examining the degeneration limit of the f-theory/heterotic duality[22]
where the k3 surface breaks into rational elliptic surfaces. the other side of the iceberg
is the representation of k3 surfaces admitting double covers of p2 along a plane sextic and
their projective realizations and it will be treated in the next section .

let me start with a few denitions. the weierstrass form comes from the most general

cubic that can be written in p2 coordinates as

f (x, y, w) = cyyyy3 + cxyyxy2 + cxxyx2y + cyywy2w + cxywxyw + cywwyw2 + cxxxx3+

3

cxxwx2w + cxwwxw2 + cwwww3

. (6)

when a number of conditions is applied to eqn. (6) it can always be reduced in the

general projective3 weierstrass form in p2 which reads

y2w + a1xyw + a3yw2 = x3 + a2x2w + a4xw2 + a6w3.

(7)

these conditions can be summarized as follows :

 demanding the curve (6) to pass through (x, y, w) = (0, 1, 0) we get cyyy = 0.
 having (0,1,0) as a non-singular point gives us cyyw 6= 0 or cxyy 6= 0.  having the
curve f (x, y, w) = w as a tangent line at innity point (0,1,0) we get one more condition
cxyy = 0 and from the previous condition cyyw 6= 0.
lastly because a non-singular point p of f is a ex or inection point if the intersection
multiplicity of the tangent line of f at p is greater or equal to 3, the curve (6) can have an
inection point at (0,1,0) if cxxy = 0 and cxxx 6= 0.
under these conditions the cubic takes the form

f = cxxxy2w + cxywxyw + cywwyw2 + cxxxx3 + cxxwx2w + cxwwxw2 + cwwww3.

(8)

this form is known as weierstrass form. by setting w = 1 we can put the cubic in the ane
weierstrass form as

y2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6.

(9)

the subscripts in the coecients of the non-singular cubic indicate the degree of ho-
mogeneuty under a certain change of variables. note that eqn.
(9) is singular only if
a3 = a4 = 0.

the elliptic curve over4 a eld k , we will need later for the realization of f-theory
compactications on k3 in 8 dimensions, is dened as a non-singular cubic that is in a
weierstrass form.

an elliptic curve over a the eld of rationals q is dened as a non-singular cubic in
weierstrass form with rational coecients. the elliptic curve over q is realized by com-
pleting the square in the weierstrass form followed by a change of variables in y to get
y2 = r(x), where r(x) a cubic in degree 3 with distinct roots. in the latter form, namely
(9) the inection point is mapped to the point at innity o = (0, 1, 0) such that it becomes
the line at innity. for the non-singular cubic curve, the existence of a specied point o,
denes a group operation on the curve associating the points on the curve with an abelian
group, the mordell-weyl group (mw), with o its identity element. what the mw group
theorem says is that the group of rational points of an elliptic curve over q, e(q), is nitely
generated. the mw group can be written as e(q)  z r  f , where f is a nite abelian
group known as the torsion subroup. the integer r is the rank of e(q). given now the
ane cubic in (9) and the denition of the mw group we need to know how it is possible
to construct for a given mw group its weierstrass form. the weierstrass form for the di-
ferent choises of the mw group may be associated with the appearance of the non-simply

3 the subscripts of the coecients denote the homogeneity of the corresponding term under a change of

variables.

4note that the ane plane k2 = (x, y) has a standard one to one embedding into p2(k). in turn , p2(k)

is dened as the quotient of (x, y, w)  (k3  0, 0, 0).

connected gauge groups [19] in 8-dimensional compactications of f-theory on a k3 surface
at its degeneration limit in the next section. we note that the torsion subgroup f of an
elliptic curve when the eld of integers k is equal to the eld of rational functions becomes
the group of sections.

before addresing the weierstrass construction, let me give rst few denitions concerning

the group formation on elliptic curves that will help us to understand the procedure.

 given an initial point o, we dene the group law on non-singular cubics with the
identity element xed at o = (x, y, w) = (0, 1, 0). we dene r = p q = p  q as the line
element between two dierent points p, q on the curve. the addition law for a point in the
curve is dened as the multiplication p + q = o  p q. this operation makes the points on
the curve to form an abelian group with o as the identity element, p + o = o  po = p .
negatives are dened by rst setting oo as the third point on the line tangent at o). by
denition p def= oop . this means p def= (oo)  p . so p + (p ) = o  p (p ) =
o  oo = o. note for the elliptic curve over the eld of rationals we dene o = o as the
inection point. in addition, for a general point p = (xo, yo) on the elliptic curve (9) the
inverse p = (xo,yo  a1xo  a3). we can easily see that for example when

a1 = a3 = 0, p = (xo,yo).

(10)

next let us look at the determination of the weierstrass form of the elliptic brations
admiting torsion points using the ane form (9). for the study of the mordell-weyl group
it is enough to examine the behaviour of the elliptic curve (9) at at the point p=(0,0). the
latter means a6 = 0 and eqn.(9) becomes

y2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2 + a4x.

(11)

now what happens is that e(k) becomes an abelian group with o = (0, 1, 0) the point at
innity as identity element of the group law on the elliptic curve. the condition that the
torsion subgroup f = z2 is equivalent to the statement that p + p = o (or p = p ). in
other words p is of order two if the tangent is  at p, vertical tangency. since the point at
innity is non-singular, to study singular points, as we said already we translate the points
on the curve at the point (0, 0). that had set a6 = 0. note that eqn. (9) is singular only
when a3 = a4 = 0. by taking now dierentials in eqn. (9) we deduce that the coecient of
dy equals zero at p. this means that a3 = 0. now the weierstrass form of the elliptic curve
becomes



f = z2,

y2 + a1xy = x3 + a2x2 + a4x.

.

(12)

in the special case that a1 = 0 eqn.
(12) gives the same weierstrass equation as that
appearing in [20, 19] . in general for an elliptic curve over the eld k = q, f must be one
of the following fteen groups[20]

z, z2, z3, . . . z9, z10, z12, z2  z2, z4  z2, z6  z2, z8  z2

(13)

for an elliptic curve over k = c there are in addition four more possibilities. they are

listed by cox and parry[15] as

z3  z3, z6  z3, z4  z4, z5  z5.

(14)

5

note that in the case where the points of the elliptic surface over c(t), are rationals, the
rational elliptic curve can be written as an elliptic surface with a section s, a jacobian[17].
note that the weierstrass forms that we examine in this paper are associated with standard
compactications of f-theory [22, 7, 8] in 8 dimensions where the antisymmetric b-eld is
zero5 as the methods discussing, other, possibilities for the torsion subgroup f6 are not
present in string theory literature we can briey discuss them here. in order to examine
higher orders in the torsion subgroup f we need the coordinates of the point 2p. at the
tangent line at a general point p=(x,y) on the cubic (9) are given by

x(2p ) =

x4  b4x2  2b6x  b8
4x3 + b2x2 + 2b4x + b6

,

where

b2 = a2
b8 = a2

1 + 4a2,
1a6 + 4a2a6  a1a2a4 + a2a2

b4 = 2a4 + a1a3,
3  a2
4.

b6 = a2

3 + 4a6,

(15)

(16)

let us examine its consequences. for the singular point p = (0, 0) eqn. (10) gives

 p = (0, a3)

(17)
lets us see now how torsion points of order three, f = z3 and higher are embedded in the
general equation (9) of the elliptic curve. let us now make the following isomorphic7 change
of variables in eqn. (11).

2p = (a2, a1a2  a3)

gives us that [23]

(x, y)  (x, y + a1

3 a4x)

(18)

(19)
torsion of order three means 2p + p = o. in other words 2p = p , p = (0, a3) and
a2 = 0. thus

y2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2.

f = z3,


lets us now returm back into eqn. (19). making another change of variables, to an

y2 + a1xy + a3xy = x3.

(20)

isomorphic curve, in the form

(x, y)  (

x
u2 ,

y
u3 ),

we get that the point p=(0,0) remains xed and eqn.(19) is transformed into

y2 + a1

3 a1a2xy + a2

2y = x3 + a2

or in more elegant form as

[24, 25].

the weierstrass form of eqn.(23) is well known in mathematics literature as tate normal
form. its discriminant is given by

 (b, c) = (1  c)4b3  (1  c)3b3  8(1  c)2b4 + 36(1  c)b4 + 16b5  27b4

(24)

and its connection to the usual from f-theory considerations discriminant  = 44 + 272
may be obvious.
we can now look at the derivation of the weierstrass form for higher than z3 torsion
subgroups. looking at (22) and repeating the previous procedure that was applied at the
z2 case, requiring the tangent at the point p to be tangent, we get

3p = (c, b  c)
p = (0, 0)
p = (0, b) 2p = (b, 0) 3p = (c, c2)

2p = (b, bc)

by taking subsequently
3p = p with c = 0,
f = z4


 = (b, o) = b4 + 16b5.

,

3p = 2p with b = c,


f = z5,

 = (c, c),

y2 + xy  by = x3  bx2,

y2 + (1  c)xy  by = x3  bx2,

3p = 3p with b = c2 + c.


f = z6,

 = (c2 + c, c).

y2 + (1  c)xy  (c2 + c)y = x3  (c2 + c)x2,

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

there are two remaining cases of weierstrass forms representing rational elliptic surfaces
where the torsion is a subgroup of z2n  z2. in those cases the rational elliptic surface is
associated with



f = z2  z2,

y2 = x(x  )(x  ),

(29)

f = z4  z2,

y2 = x(x +  2)(x + 2).


the form (29) appears in this form after the use of mspecic related theorems while (30)
comes by demanding that one of the points (x, 0), with x = 0, ,  in (29) must be the
double of another number in order for the z2  z2 to ow at z4  z2. the weierstrass
representations of the elliptic brations with a section in eqn.s (12), (20), (26), (27), (28),
(29), (30) are all relevant at the degeneration limit of f-theory on the elliptic k3 studied in
the next section.

3 eight-dimensional compactications of f-theory as k3 bra-

tions

3.1 why double covers?

in this section we examine 8 dimensional compactications of f-theory and examine the
heterotic/duality map[22, 7] at the stable degeneration limit[13, 26]. according to this
duality map, f-theory on a k3 surface admitting an elliptic bration with a section is on
the same moduli space as the heterotic string on a t 2 torus. take for example the e8  e8
heterotic string. then at the limit that the t 2 torus is large, the k3 surface degenerates
into a variety that is made from the union of two intersecting rational elliptic surfaces s1, s2
intersecting along an elliptic curve e. at this limit the j-invariant of the f-theory elliptic
curve e coincides with the j-invariant of the heterotic elliptic curve [26] representing the
t 2 torus as8

y2 = x3 + ax + b.

(31)

on the contrary the k3 sf compactication of f-theory is represented as an elliptic
bration over a p1 base, namely as a map  : sf  p1. this constitutes a form of violation
of double cover parity signalling dierent treatment of the bases of the duality pairs. we
demand that the violation of double cover parity, of the f-theory/heterotic duality map
can be corrected by considering generating the k3 surface from double covers. the latter
happens, in our case, by considering double covers of k3 onto p2. it is known[28] double
covers of k3 onto p2 are branched along a plane sextic curve. that idea will constitute our
main tool in this section. the dierence between double covers onto p2 and p1 between the
two dual sides can intuitively be explained by the following correspondence.

consider the cubic dened by

xy2 = z(x  z)(x  z).

(32)

then two generic members of the cubic pencil9 may be described as cubic curves with
commom exes at (0, 1, 0) and common tangents at (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1) and (, 0, 1). by
blowing up the base points one can obtains the quotient of e  p1 under the involution

(y, z)  (y,z),

(33)

where e is the elliptic curve connected to (0, 1,, ). the notation (y, z) refers to the ele-
ments of e  p1. in turn, two members of the cubic pencil together with its two degenerate
bers calculate four points on p1 and thus an elliptic curve e. as a result the double cover
of the rational elliptic bration along two members has apriori its double cover given by the
abelian surface e  e. if we can connect in some way the double cover of some form of
abelian surface in some form of f-theory compactication as a double cover we are done.

9note that the term pencil is dened to be the dimension of the projective space that parametrizes

eqn.(35). namely one in our case.

8

the way to proceed is to connect the double sextics to singular k3 surfaces[27]. every
singular k3 surfaces is the double cover of a kummer surface. let us rst give some de-
nitions. the lattice associated to the latter has rank n s = 20 and signature (+1, (1)19).
in general to singular k3 surfaces one associates[27] the picard number

sin
k3 = 2 +

k

x=1

(e) + rkf,

(34)

where f is the order of the group of sections f that is the mordell-weyl group and r its
rank. the quantity (e) is associated to the number of companents of the set e of the
singular bers. similarly, when a curve x is the double cover of y branched along a curve
c, then

(x)  (y ) + (c).

(35)
for a plane sextic curve c coming as a double cover onto p2, 0    19. so by comparison
with (34) we can notice that the index (c) associated to the sextic has a similar role as those
of the singular bers of the singular k3 surfaces. in fact we will see, in the rest of the section,
in the cases of interest in 8 dimensional compactications of f-theory/heterotic duality map,
k3 surfaces admitting elliptic brations with a section and k3 surfaces admitting double
covers on to p2 coincide . the latter list of k3 brations has been worked out in [14].
so by considering double covers onto the base manifold on both sides of the 8-dimensional
f-theory/heterotic duality map we recover naturality in the treatment of the base.

a sextic is called maximizing if its index is maximal,  = 19. a a result from (35) it
follows that the maximizing sextic c is a singular k3 surface. if the index (s) = 19 the
singularities of the sextic are in the form a1, d2n, e7 and e8. in this case the sextic is called
supermaximizing and the number of the rational components in this case is less than ten.
that can be proved by a simple calculation of the euler number. we remind that these are
singularities of the branch curve and not its double cover. the double cover has as usual
a, d, e singularities. this suggests that in the general case k3 surfaces that are acted by
involutions not having xed points have singular bers with at least ten components. when
its ten those components are rational. in fact the following table will assist us to our work
later.

3.2 elliptic brations with involutions
the point that we follow is to consider elliptic k3 brations  : y  p1, where y is an
elliptic k3 surface, and examine the eect of the involutions that respect the bration. the
involution after resolution is represented by x = y / where tilde denotes desingularization.
there are two possibilities that can be realized for the surface x. the surface x can be
either a ruled surface of an elliptic surface. we can have x as a rational ruled surface, and
a k3 surface coming from the resolution, only if each ber is invariant under the involution
and contains xedpoints. in fact, by blow down x to a minimal model xo, containing no
exceptional curves of the rst kind, that can be the hirzebrush surface f4, we obtain y as a
double cover of xo branched along a 4-section o = s + t .we denoted by s the minimal
section, s2
= 4 and t is a trisection disjoint from s. one can now observe that the

index of the elliptic bration is the index of bo or t. in this case the branch locus of the
covering will be a transversal divisor hitting each rational ber exactly four times.

in particular the k3 surface y with an extremal bration is realized as the double
covering of a maximizing sextic, only if the bration has three singular bers of the type i2,
in, ii, iii, iii. something that was practically suggested in the previous subsection.

the second case that we discuss is when x is an elliptic surface. this case constitutes
the main case considered in the following discusions. now the quotient transposes the bers
i.e permutes them and the branch locus is made of two bers. in this case the elliptic k3
surface y may be obtained as a double sextic as a union of two cubics. the results in the
case of double covers are summarized as follows:

there is a dierent case that involutions of the surface y could be considered, that is
when x is an enriques surface and the involution of the k3 surface has no xed points.
however, we will not discuss this case here.

3.3 examples with point like instantons

we will discuss the case of the creation of an e8 gauge symmetry in the f-theory/heterotic
duality realization in eight dimensions[13, 26]. we describe the case that x is an elliptic
surface. now the sextic is the union of the two cubics and the rational surface is coming by
taking the double covers branched at two bers. elliptic brations generated in this way
always have sections. in the case of e8  e8 symmetry on the f-theory side, the observed
symmetry group e8 is reproduced by the elements of the vanishing cohomology h2(si, z),
with i either 1 or 2, of the rational elliptic surface si. in geometrical terms the rational
elliptic surface represented as a cubic c0 and a exed line l forms a cubic pencil spanned
by c0 and 3l. this has a ii and 2i2 bers, an thus ganerates an unbroken e8 gauge
symmetry from point like instantons[30, 7]. taking the double cover of the sextic formed by
the two nodal cubics in the pencil will produce an elliptic bration of type 2ii2i2. note
that by taking the double cover along two non-singular members of the cubic pencil 2i2 gets
replaced by 4i1. amazingly enough it appears that the double cover of the k3 bration can
create the whole of e8  e8 observed gauge symmetry!.
another elliptic bration on the same k3 may be build by considering the lines through
one of the nodes. now the intersection of the two cubics10 of order nine will give rise to an
i18, the other node will give us a i2 and there are four tangent lines from the point to the
nodal cubic. in total we get the conguration i18i24i1 with the order of the mordell-weyl
group to be three.

eective string theories from double covers

let us now consider the usual f-theory compactication, on a calabi-yau 3-fold with an
fn base [7, 8] is on the same moduli space as the heterotic string on a k3 surface. further
compactication on four dimensions on both sides on a t 2 torus may produce a n = 2
vector multiplet eective theory with e.g an sl(2, z)t  sl(2, z)u duality invariance. if
there are wilson lines on the t 2 torus the classical perturbative invariance of the vector
multiplet eective theory becomes sp(4, z). in this case the formulation of the eective
theory of light modes is consistently described in terms on the genus two siegel modular
forms which can reproduce consistently the one loop corrections to the gauge coupling
constants of n = 1 (0, 2) orbifold compactications of the heterotic string[10]. as we said
in the introduction it is desirable to have an intepretation of the formulation of the heterotic
string compactications in terms of particular riemann surfaces with manifest sp(4, z)
invariance. here we will do just that. the way that we will proceed in our investigation is
to rst dene the basic elements that dene the n = 1 (0, 2) orbifold compactications of
the heterotic string and then describe the derivation of the riemann surface possessing the
sp(4, z) invariance. for genus g = 1 the graded ring of modular forms is generated by the
e4, e6 modular forms11. in the genus two case the graded ring is generated by the siegel
modular forms e4, e6, and the cusp forms 10, 12 and 35 where the latter are given by
the following expressions

10remember that a rational elliptic surface is the blow up of p2 at the nine intersection points of two

cubic curves, or the nine basepoints of the cubic pencil.

11the subscript denotes the modular weight of the respective modular form.

11

i4 = x(m)8,
i6 = x xsyzygous(m1m2m3)4,
i10 = 214  10 = (m)2,
i12 = 2173  12 = x(m1m2 . . . m6)4,
i35 = 23953i  35 = (m)( xazygous(m1m2m3)20),

(36)

where m1 = (0, 0, 0, 0), m2 = (0, 0, 0, 1/2) and m3 = 0, 0, 1/2, 0. the sum in 12 extends
over the fteen gorel quadruple[32] a sequence of four even characteristics. next consider
the hyperelliptic curve for a genus 2g+2 surface in the form

respectively in the genus case as

y2 = 2g+2

i=1 (x  ei), ei 6= ej, f ori 6= j,

y2 = 6

i=1(x  ei), ei 6= ej, f ori 6= j,

(37)

(38)

which represents the double cover of the sphere branched over 2g+2 points, respectively 6
points. note that m = d1/8 , where d is the discriminant of p6. on the curve (37) one
can attach a lattice generated by the pair (i, ), where i is a g  g identity matrix and  is
the period matrix[33]. the surface (37) equipped with the pair (i, ) is called a jacobian.
we denote by (a1,, ag, b1, . . . , bg) the canonical homology basis on (37). in addition, we can
dene by (1, . . . , g) as the dual homology basis. note that the dual homology basis can be
dened in terms of i = xidz/y, i = 1,   , g. in fact by taking the map from the jacobian
to the complex numbers we dene the  functions

  a

b ! = xnz g+1

exp(n + a)t (n + a) + 2i(n + a)  (z + b)

(39)

with the usual build in sp(2g, z) invariance. one might now start to feel what we are
trying to prove. we will prove that under certain conditions all n=1 (0,2) orbifold com-
pactications of the heterotic string can be described by certain curves, the binary sextics..
in particular once the moduli coming from a heterotic string vacum are known, we can
describe the precise form of the riemann surface that they line on.
however something is still missing from our discussion. the element that we require is that
there is a birational correspondence [31] between the projective varieties associated with
the graded ring of even projective invariants of binary sextics and with the graded ring
of modular forms. in simple terms that means that the projective variety linked with the
graded ring of even projective invariants of binary sextics is a compactication of moduli of
curves two.

so, by keeping in mind the analogy with the branched sextic curve coming from double

covering of p 2 in the previous sections, we conjecture the following theorem :

theorem the projective variety associated with the even projective invariants of binary
sextics, for a particular (0,2) n = 1 heterotic string theory vacuum, represents the riemann

12

surface with manifest sp(4,z) invariance that the moduli live. lets us explain in more detail
this issue. the projective invariants a, b, c, d, of the binary sextics have degrees 2,4,6,10.
so if we symbolize by 1, 2, . . . , 6 the six roots of the sextic sox 6 + s1x 5 + . . . + s6 and
we denote their dierence i  j by (ij) the invariants take the following form

a(s) = s2

(12)2(34)2(56)2

o xf if teen

b(s) = s4

(12)2(23)2(31)2(45)2(56)2(64)2

c(s) = s6

ox(12)2(23)2(31)2(45)2(56)2(64)2(14)2(25)2(36)2
o j<k(jk)2.

d(s) = s10

because any sextic can be brought in the general form

x(x  1)(x  1)(x  2)(x  3)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

we can replace each of the three lambdas in (41) by some theta functions of zero argument,
namely

1 = (

11001000
01000000

)2, 2 = (

10011100
00010100

theta functions of genus two. it can be proved that 1, 2, 3 can be expanded in terms of
even powers of  when  is small. as a result all the variables in eqn. (41) are xed and
its roots may be calculated. moreover the invariants a, b, c, d are expressed in terms of 
and s. it is remarkable that the following relations hold

d/a5  12, (b/a2)3  j(1)j(2)12, ((3c  ab))/a3)2  (j(1)  j(2))12.

(44)

or in precise form

i4 = b, i6 =

1
2

(ab  3c), i10 = d, i12 = ad, i35 = 53d2e.

(45)

that means that the uniformation parameters of the sextic (41) are xed genus two elements
therefore possessing manifest sp(4, z) invariance and therefore conrming our theorem. in
its non-perturbative form the equation for the sextic p6 involves the parametric relation
(45). note that from eqn. (44) one can notice that the fundamental invariant of the full
theory are expressed in terms of products of j-invariants. what we have not discuss is the
expansion of genus two theta functions (43) in terms of the epsilon parameter, our wilson
lines, represents exactly the fact that the space of projective varieties corresponding to the
invariants a, b, c, d has been blown up [31] such that the jacobian variety of the genus
two curve has degenerate to products of elliptic curves. the blow up process is necessary
since the projective variety (38), does not include apriori the siegel fundamental domain.
the correspondence with the heterotic string comes after identifying 1 = t , 2 = u,
 = w ilson line. at the points that te discriminant of the projective variery of (37)

13

degenerates both t, u and the wilson line u are involved in a non-trivial relation. that
means that at the point where the discriminant of eqn. (41) vanishes one or more of the
moduli may be xed therefore breaking non-trivially space-time supersymmetry.

alternatively thinking eqn. (38) supplied with the projective invariants a, b, c, d at
the limit of small , represents the (0, 2) perturbative expansion of the n = 2 sector of the
4d heterotic string vacum.
by taking the equation

lets us now make a comment regarding the 8-dimensional compactications of f-theory.

(branched sextic) = 0

(46)

we may describe the riemann surface responsible for the 8-dimensional k3 brations as
double cover onto p2. those compactications that are characterized by the vanishing locus
have embedded sp(4, z) invariance and may represent how the 7-branes degenerate. of
course the real test of our conjecture at this point is to test this result in its four dimensional
counterpart involing compactications on a three-fold. this task will be performed in a
future work.

5 one loop 4d heterotic prepotential for subgroups of p sl(2, z)

n = 2 heterotic string theories in four dimensions come from compactication of the ten
dimensional heterotic string on the k3 t 2. in the simplest case the eective action of light
modes is invariant under the classical modular group is sl(2, z)t  sl(2, z)u . in this case
the formulation of f-theory compactication has been given in [7, 8]. consider the usual
f-theory/heterotic duality map in eight dimensions[13]. when compactifying the f-theory
side on a k3 surface sf admitting an elliptic bration this becomes dual at the heterotic
string compactied on a t 2 torus. at the degeneration limit the j-invariant of the f-theory
elliptic curve becomes identical to the j-invariant of the heterotic elliptic curve. if we further
compactify on an another k3 surface both dual sides then what eectively happens is that
the statement about monodromy of the f-theory elliptic curve translates into a statement
about targe space duality. so by the use of the mordell-weyl group action on the f-theory
elliptic curve in the original eight dimensional compactication of f-theory we can control
the target space duality group in four dimensions.

let us now consider that our f-theory elliptic curve contains points that are associated
to a cyclic subgroup of order 2 that a generator has not been chosen.
in this case the
f-theory has monodromy )o(2) and the 4d n = 2 theory coming from compactication
of the heterotic string compactied on the k3  t 2 is invariant under the target space
duality group o(2)t  o(2)u . the third derivative of the prepotential of the n = 2 vector
multiplet theory is given by
