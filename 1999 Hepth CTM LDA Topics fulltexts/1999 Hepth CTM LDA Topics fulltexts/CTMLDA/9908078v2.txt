we show that the calculation of l-loop feynman integrals
in d dimensions can be reduced to a series of matrix multi-
plications in d  l dimensions. this leads to a new type of
expansions for the critical exponents in three dimensions in
which all coecients are calculable exactly.

1. recently, an ecient method has been developed for
constructing all feynman diagrams of a quantum eld
theory recursively to arbitrary order in perturbation the-
ory [1]. the construction has also been automatized by
computer algebra [1], so that one can now easily list all
diagrams to any desired order, limited only by computer
time.

the only open problem is an ecient evaluation of the
associated feynman integrals. the highest loop number
so far has been treated in 4-theory where renormaliza-
tion constants of eld normalization and mass are now
known numerically up to seven loops [2].

for a reliable calculation of all critical exponents with
an accuracy which has become recently available in satel-
lite experiments on superuid helium [3] it is desirable to
know the perturbation expansions to even higher order
[4,6].
in this note we would like to propose a pertur-
bative evaluation of many-loop feynman integrals which
reduces the integrations over d  l loop momenta to a
series of multiplications of d  l-dimensional matrices,
thus reducing greatly the number of numerical opera-
tions.

2. the method is most easily introduced by treating an
exactly solvable class of integrals

the exponential es(p) is now expanded in a taylor se-
ries, and the expectation values hs(p) s(p)i are cal-
culated via a wick expansion using the basic correlation

down in (12) and (13), for lack of space], the relative de-
viations from the respective exact values 1/2 and 1/8
[which follow from eq. (2)] are shown in table i [columns
marked with (ps)]. the deviation sequences tend slowly
toward zero, and grow again for larger order as a conse-
quence of the asymptotic nature of the expansions.

the partial sums yield integrals whose rst ten terms
tend exponentially fast toward the exact results, as shown
in figs. 1.

4. so far we have calculated only vacuum diagrams.
there is no problem in extending the method to dia-
grams with external legs. the rst nontrivial feynman
integral in the self-energy of a 4-theory, for example, is

where we have set p3  p1 + p2. after removing the
extra source term 2p1q by a shift of the integration vari-
able p1  p1  q, which produces an exponential factor
e2k11q2
, the integral can be treated as before, yielding an
expansion in powers of  with q2-dependent coecients.

5. the above treatment of feynman diagrams oers the
interesting possibility of deriving a completely new type
of power series expansions for the critical exponents of
4-theories in three dimensions, in which expansion co-
ecients are calculable exactly, in contrast to the known
expansions of ref. [2]. for this we observe that our power
series for the feynman integrals can be reexpanded in
powers of g by inserting   g/(m + g). then i 1
1 () and
i 3
2 () become

where g  g/m. the coecients have now alternating
signs. these expansions must be evaluated in the strong-
coupling limit g  . this is again possible with the
help of diagonal pade approximations, and the results
are precisely the same as those in table i. note that the
choice of the parameter m is irrelevant in this limit.

now we recall that the critical behavior of 4-theory
can also be derived from power series expansions of the
renormalization constants in the strong-coupling limit
gb/mb  , where gb and mb are the bare coupling
strength and mass of the theory. let us identify the above
expansion parameter g with cgb/mb, where c is an ar-
bitrary parameter which may be chosen at the end to
optimize the speed of convergence. then we insert the
expansions of the feynman integrals in powers of gb/mb
into the feynman diagrams of the perturbation expan-
sions of the renormalization constants of the 4-theory.
this leads to a new type of series in powers of gb/mb
whose coecients are determined exactly. by going to
the strong-coupling limit gb/mb   as described in
ref. [5,6], we can obtain the critical exponents in three
dimensions in a completely new way.

from the connected vacuum diagrams we obtain an

expansion of the form

w = m3

bz = m3

b(cid:0)1 + a1gb + a2g2

b + . . .(cid:1) .

(27)

for a comparison with experiment one assumes the bare
mass to go linearly to zero as the temperature t ap-
proaches the critical temperature, i.e. m2
b  (t /tc  1).
the vacuum energy w has then for small mb the scaling
behavior (t /tc1)2  m42
, where  = 23 is the
critical exponent of the peak in the specic heat in three
dimensions (is the exponent of the correlation length).
since gb grows for small mb like 1/mb, the power series
for z in (27) must behave like z  g21
. the critical

exponent  is therefore found from the strong-coupling
limit of the power series

(gb) =

1
2

(1 + d log z/d log gb),

(28)

evaluated as explained in ref. [5,6].

also the exponent  governing the approach to scal-
ing can be obtained from the series (28), since (gb)
approaches  for large gb like +const/g
b. thus 
is found from the strong-coupling limit of the series
(gb) = 1  d log (gb)/d log gb(gb) (see [7] for
more details).
the third independent critical exponent may be de-
rived from the perturbative corrections to the eld nor-
malization. for this we take the expansion for the self-
energy (q) and extract the coecient of the q2 term.
this is done most simply by dierentiating all feynman
integrals of the two-point function using the rule (in d
dimensions)


q2 =

1
2d

2

qq

,

(29)

and setting q = 0. the momentum q always ows
through one or more lines of the diagram, allowing the
dierentiations to be performed as follows:

2

qq

1

(p  q)2 + m2 =

2d

[(p  q)2 + m2]2
8 (p  q)2
[(p  q)2 + m2]3 .
+

(30)

after setting q = 0 in the resulting feynman integrals,
the calculation of the eld normalization proceeds using
the above formulas for the vacuum diagrams.

note that the -dependent feynman integrals are all
nite for small . however, as  increasing towards unity,
a pole is encountered at  = 2/3. thus, the expansion of
a pole term  1/(2/3) should be subtracted from the -
expansions of divergent integrals before one can evaluate
perturbation series at  = 1, i.e., before going to the
strong-coupling limit of gb.

6. summarizing we have shown that just as the genera-
tion of all feynman diagrams [1], also their evaluation can
now be automatized by computer algebra, with the ad-
ditional advantage that all expansion coecients emerge
as exact numbers.

the actual calculation of diagrams with eight and and
more loops will, of course, require a considerable amount
of work. it remains to be seen whether the new perturba-
tion expansions converge more rapidly against the exact
results than the presently known purely numerical ones.
