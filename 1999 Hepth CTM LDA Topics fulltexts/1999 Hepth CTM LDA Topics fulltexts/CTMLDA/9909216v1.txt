abstract

the g-function was introduced by aeck and ludwig as a measure of the ground state
degeneracy of a conformal boundary condition. we consider this function for pertur-
bations of the conformal yanglee model by bulk and boundary elds using conformal
perturbation theory (cpt), the truncated conformal space approach (tcsa) and the
thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba). we nd that the tba equations derived by leclair
et al describe the massless boundary ows, up to an overall constant, but are incorrect
when one considers a simultaneous bulk perturbation; however the tba equations do cor-
rectly give the non-universal linear term in the massive case, and the ratio of g-functions
for dierent boundary conditions is also correctly produced. this ratio is related to the
ysystem of the yanglee model and by comparing the perturbative expansions of the
ysystem and of the g-functions we obtain the exact relation between the uv and ir
parameters of the massless perturbed boundary model.

introduction

consider the partition function of a classical statistical-mechanical system dened on a
cylinder of length r and circumference l. among the characteristics of the model might
be a bulk mass scale m and boundary scales depending on the boundary conditions  and
 imposed at the two ends of the cylinder; we will highlight the role of these quantities by
denoting the partition function z(m, r, l). if r is taken to innity with all other variables
held xed, then

z(m, r, l)  a(m, l) er ecirc

0

(m,l) ,

(1.1)

0

where ecirc
(m, l) is the ground state energy of the model on a circle of circumference l.
to derive this asymptotic r-dependence, it is sucient to treat the boundary conditions as
boundary states |  i [1] in a formalism where time runs along the length of the cylinder, and
states are propagated by a bulk hamiltonian hcirc(m, l):

z(m, r, l) = h  | exp(rhcirc(m, l))|  i .

(1.2)

at large r the contribution of the ground state | i dominates, establishing (1.1) and also
giving

a(m, l) = h  | ih |  i

h | i

.

(1.3)

the inner products appearing in (1.3) should in general contain a term corresponding to a
free-energy per unit length, i.e.

log(

h |  i
h | i1/2

) = lf + log(g(m, l)) .

(1.4)

this linear term can in principle be extracted unambiguously from the large l behaviour of
log(h |  i ). the question is then whether the functions log(g(m, l)) now contain universal
information.
in the case m = 0, i.e. for critical bulk, aeck and ludwig [2] pointed out that the uv
and ir limits of these functions, log(g(0, 0)) and log(g(0,)), play the role of a generalised
ground state degeneracy for the uv and ir conformal boundary conditions respectively.
these can be easily calculated for many conformal eld theories, and can enable one to
identify the boundary conditions uniquely.

the universality of the g-functions is however a somewhat delicate issue when the model
has a mass scale, either in the bulk or at the boundary. for example, one could imagine that
in some calculational schemes the boundaries acquire a nite thickness, and so the eective
cylinder length would decrease by some nite amount  to r , in which case log(g) would
be altered

log(g(m, l))  log(g(m, l)) +


12l

c(ml) ,

where c(ml) is related to the ground state energy on the circle by

ecirc

0

(m, l) = fbulkl 


6l

c(ml) .

(1.5)

(1.6)

more generally, the fact that the g-functions have to be extracted from subleading contri-
butions to log z makes their calculation much trickier than that of the corresponding bulk
quantity c(m l).

if the model is integrable, one might hope to be able to address these issues in greater
depth. this was one of the topics of some work by leclair et al. [3]. using the thermodynamic
bethe ansatz (tba) technique, they proposed equations for log(g), but up to now these have
not been checked in detail. the main purpose of this paper is to provide some such checks
in a concrete example, namely the scaling yang-lee model, making use both of conformal
perturbation theory and of a recently-introduced generalisation of the tcsa to boundary
situations [4]. we nd that the tba g-functions describes the massless ow well (up to
an overall constant) but the massive ows are not well described. however, we nd that the
tba g-functions of [3] do appear to describe correctly the ratio of the g-functions for dierent
boundary conditions of the same bulk model. further, the tba expression for this ratio has
a very simple form in terms of the yfunction of the yanglee model. this enables us to (a)
provide a perturbative expansion for the massive yfunction and (b) nd the coecient in
the relation between uv and ir parameters in the boundary yang-lee model model exactly,
a result announced in [4].

we rst discuss the conformal perturbation theory (cpt) expressions for log g and then
how the truncated conformal space approach (tcsa) can be used to investigate these func-
tions. we then turn to the tba equations and the properties of their solutions. finally we
compare the results of the two methods and nd the relation between uv and ir parameters.

2 boundary conformal eld theory

we begin with a sketch of boundary conformal eld theory in general, although we shall often
specialise to those theories described in the bulk by a minimal virasoro theories with atype
diagonal modular invariant. at the end we give the details for the yang-lee model. for a
general discussion of the boundary content of the virasoro minimal models see [5].

a boundary conformal eld theory is specied by giving the eld content in the bulk, a
list of the possible boundary conditions and the eld contents of these boundary conditions,
the elds which interpolate them, and some constants.

in the bulk there are primary elds i of weights hi, hi which for a diagonal modular

invariant are equal; under conformal transformations they obey

xi

i(w, w) ,

i(z, z) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

w

z(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where xi = 2hi.

for the aseries, the conformal boundary conditions (which we shall denote by ) may
themselves also be indexed by the virasoro minimal representations [1, 5]. we adopt the
notation ()
(x) for a eld of weight hj which interpolates two boundary conditions , ,
i is one,
which may be the same or dierent. such a eld exists if the fusion coecient n 
and does not exist if it is zero. we take such boundary primary elds to transform under
remember that for a-modular invariant virasoro minimal models all representations are self-conjugate

j

and all the fusion coecients are either 1 or 0

(z) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

inside correlation functions we assume that the product of elds can be replaced by their
operator product expansion  we do not try to interpret them as genuine expansions of the
actions of operators, nor do we consider the associated problems of orderings of the arguments
of the elds.

there are three dierent operator products  bulk-bulk, bulk-boundary and boundary-

boundary. the rst are the standard expressions ,

next we have the operator products of the boundary primary elds:

i(z, z) j(w, w) xk

(2.2)

finally, a primary bulk eld near a boundary of type  may be expanded in boundary elds
as

()bj

i |2(z  w)|hjxi ()

j

(w) + . . . ,

(2.3)

i(z, z) xj

where z is in the bulk and w is the point on the boundary closest to z.

to determine the correlation functions consistently, one needs to normalise the dierent
boundary conditions dierently. one way to do this is to give the zero-point functions on a
disc of radius 1 with boundary condition , which we denote by z,

z = h 1idisc



.

(2.4)

the rules for calculating the various constants in equations (2.1), (2.2), (2.3) and (2.4) are
essentially given in a series of papers by cardy and lewellen [1,7,8], but some work is required
to obtain explicit expressions. for the structure constants of the atype model, see [9].

using these structure constants, zero-point functions and the chiral blocks, we can assign a
value to any n-point function, i.e. to any surface with some assignment of conformal boundary
conditions to the boundaries, and some insertions of bulk and boundary elds; if the boundary
conditions change at some point along a boundary, then there is of necessity a boundary
changing eld inserted at this point.

we can now express various simple correlation functions on a disc of radius 1 in terms of

there is some choice in the transformations of boundary elds, see [6]

we are interested in calculating correlation functions on the cylinder but we will be able

let us consider the partition function of a right cylinder of length r, with the two ends
being circles of circumference l with conformal boundary conditions  and . this can be
realised as a rectangle in the upper half plane with vertices 0, l, ir and l + ir, with the two
vertical sides identied. the partition function can be written as

z cyl

()(r, l) = trh()(cid:16)exp(lbh strip

() (r))(cid:17) .

(2.6)

by mapping this rectangle to a half-annulus in the upper half plane by z 7 exp(z/r), we
can use the operator formalism in the upper-half plane. the hilbert space h() decomposes
into a direct sum of irreducible representations of one copy of the virasoro algebra

and the hamiltonian is given as

we can also map the cylinder into a complete annulus of inner and outer radii exp(2r/l)
and 1 respectively by z7w= exp(2iz/l), and use the operator formalism on the plane. the

model it is convenient to take h 0| 0i = 1.

for a boundary state to represent a circular boundary with conformally invariant boundary
condition, it must satisfy

(2.12)

z cyl

(cid:0)lm  lm(cid:1)|  i = 0 , h  |(cid:0)lm  lm(cid:1) = 0 .

a basis of states satisfying these conditions are the ishibashi states. there is one such state
for each virasoro representation in the minimal model in question, which we denote by

these are normalised so that

whereeq = exp(4r/l). we expand the boundary states in terms of the ishibashi states as

|  i =xj

gj
 | j ii .

(it is always possible to normalise the elds and states such that the coecients gi
 are real,
and we shall assume that has been done. see [9] for details). using these states, the partition
function is given from (2.12) by

noting that

these equations can then be solved to nd the gi

one can also show that the same boundary states |  i describe a circular boundary of
radius one in the plane and so the constants z can now be found by expressing the one-point

this completes the identication of the structure constants and zero-point functions. to end
this section we recall how to nd the conformal values of the g-functions in terms of this
conformal data. to x the g-functions g, we note that the leading term in the cylinder
partition function is given by

2.1 the yang-lee model

the yang-lee model is the simplest non-unitary conformal eld theory, m2,5, and has central
charge 22/5 and eective central charge 2/5. there are only two representations of the
virasoro algebra of interest, of weight 0 and 1/5, and consequently only two bulk primary

so some care must be taken to dene boundary states for discs of general radius.

conformally-invariant boundary conditions, which we denote by 11 and . the fusion rules
are

11  11 = 11 ,
11   =  ,
   = 11 +  .

(2.21)

from these rules we read o that there are only three non-trivial boundary elds, all of weight
h = 1/5. two of these interpolate the two dierent conformal boundary conditions,

which we shall both denote by , and one lives on the  boundary,

g-functions and perturbed conformal eld theory

we dene the g-functions of the perturbed theory as
g = h  | i
h | i1/2

,

(3.1)

where |  i is the (possibly perturbed) boundary state and | i is the ground state of the
perturbed theory. typically these functions will not be equal to the g-functions g but will
dier by the extensive freeenergy terms discussed in the introduction:

log g = log g  l f pcft



.

however it is the g that are accessible in conformal perturbation theory, and not the g.
currently it is not possible to determine f pcft
directly from conformal perturbation theory,
but using the truncated conformal space approximation (tcsa), it is possible to approximate
the functions g numerically for a reasonable range of l, and this will enable us in some cases
to estimate f pcft
 . for the case of the yanglee model, the boundary conditions of interest
are 11 (which admits no relevant perturbation) and (h), the perturbation of the conformal
 boundary by the integral along the boundary



the bulk perturbation corresponds to a term in the action

hz (x) dx .
z (w, w) d2w .

the functions g therefore have expansions

log g11(, l) = pn=0 dn (l12/5)n ,
log g(h)(, l) = pm,n=0 cmn (hl6/5)m(l12/5)n .

(3.2)

(3.4)

in section 3.3 we discuss the tcsa calculation of g, but before that, in the next section we
calculate the following coecients in their expansions:

log g11(, l) = log g11 + d1 (l12/5) + . . . ,

log g(h)(, l) = log g + c10 (hl6/5) + c20 (hl6/5)2 + c01 (l12/5) + . . .

(3.5)

to the order to which we will work, the bulk and boundary perturbations can be treated
independently, so we shall rst calculate c01 and d1, and then c10 and c20.

3.1 the bulk perturbation

for a purely bulk perturbation (3.3), after mapping to the plane, the hamiltonian of the
perturbed theory is

the full ground state is given by

| i = | i + xa

a| a i + o(2) ,

(3.6)

(3.7)

where the sum is over an orthonormal eigenbasis of bh0 (where the  indicates that the ground

state | i is to be excluded) and the coecients a are given by rst order perturbation
theory as

a =

combining (3.8) and (3.6), we nd

where p = | ih | is the projector onto the state | i. from (3.7), the norm of | i is
unchanged to order , and hence the correction to the g-function is given by

log g(, l)
g(0, l)

= l12/5a + o(2) ,

3.2 the boundary perturbation

the boundary condition (h) corresponds to the perturbation of the  boundary by the
addition to the action of the term

s = hz |dz| (z) .

(3.19)

to calculate c10 and c20 we can assume that the bulk theory is unperturbed which means
that we can replace the ground state | i by | i. the perturbed boundary state is

h (h)| = h |(cid:16)1  s + 1

2 (s)2 + . . .(cid:17) ,

and so the coecients in the expansion

can be written in terms of the simple disc amplitudes

the coecients c10 and c20 have also been calculated using the free-eld construction in [22],
with the same results that we nd.

3.3 evaluating log(g) using the tcsa method

the truncated conformal space approximation (tcsa) introduced in [11] gives numerical
approximations to the lowest eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of a perturbed conformal eld
theory by restricting the hamiltonian to a nite dimensional subspace, working out the matrix
elements exactly and diagonalising the resulting matrix numerically.

originally developed for systems on a circle, we outlined in [4] how this method can also
be applied to a system on a strip with conformal boundary conditions ,  on the two ends
and perturbed simultaneously by a bulk eld  of weight x and by boundary elds l and
r of weights xl and xr. the resulting hamiltonian is



bh(r, , hl, hr)
r(cid:16)l0  c

=

z=0
(cid:12)(cid:12)2x

24 + (cid:12)(cid:12) r

(cid:12)(cid:12)1xr r(1)(cid:17) .
the matrix elements of bh can be easily calculated numerically and the hamiltonian diago-

(cid:12)(cid:12)1xl l(1) + hr(cid:12)(cid:12) r

(exp(i)) d + hl(cid:12)(cid:12) r

the partition function on a cylinder of circumference l can be estimated numerically as

nalised on spaces of the order of 100 states.

the trace over the nite-dimensional truncated space.

z(hl)(hr)(l, r, ) = tr(exp(lbh(r, , hl, hr))) .

more details will be given in the next section where the method is applied to perturbations of
the 11 and (0) boundary conditions, both by bulk perturbations, and (for the (0) boundary
condition) at the boundary. in the presence of the bulk perturbation, the mass scale is set by
the mass m of the single massive particle of the scaling yanglee model, which is related to
 by [12, 13]

m = 5/12 ,

 = 219/12

((3/5)(4/5))5/12
55/16(2/3)(5/6)

= 2.642944 . . . ,

we present the results for the (11, 11) and (11, (h)) boundary conditions in the next two
sections.

13

3.3.1 the strip with (11, 11) boundary conditions

the (11, 11) system has no relevant boundary perturbations and so the strip hamiltonian is
simply

(exp(i)) d(cid:17) .

bh(r, ) =



r(cid:16)l0  c

24 + (cid:12)(cid:12) r

z=0
(cid:12)(cid:12)2x

the spectrum comprises scattering states of a single massive particle of mass m and no

boundary bound states. in gure 1 we plot the 15 lowest eigenvalues of bh/m against r = m r

we estimate the partition function by taking the sum over all the tcsa eigenvalues

(as estimated from tcsa with 29 states).

etcsa

i

at the given truncation level

z(r, l) =xi

exp(letcsa

i

) ,

where l = m l. for any particular l, we expect that the behaviour of z(r, l) for small r is
dominated by the conformal point, while at large r truncation errors will dominate. if we are
lucky, there will be an intermediate range of r (the scaling region) in which z(r, l) exhibits
the scaling form

log z(r, l)  a(l) r + b(l) + . . . .

(3.28)

from equations (1.1), (1.3) and (3.1), we expect that

a(l) =

ecyl
0
m

,

b(l) = 2 log g11(l) .

to test for the behaviour (3.28) we plot log(d log z(r, l)/dr) to see if, for given l, there is a
region in r for which it is approximately constant. in gure 2 we plot log(d log z(r, l)/dr)
against log(r/l) for various xed values of l calculated using the tcsa with 19 states and
with 106 states. for small values of l we see the typical behaviour expected  as r increases,
log(d log z(r, l)/dr) attens out to a scaling region in which it is approximately constant
before truncation eects take over. we can be fairly sure that this is indeed the scaling region
by comparing the behaviour for dierent truncation levels, and, as expected, increasing the
truncation level extends the scaling region further into the ir. on close examination we nd
for small l . 1 that the scaling region is centred on log(r/l)  1.21 for 19 states and on
log(r/l)  1.46 for 106 states. hence we shall take the tcsa estimates of a(l) and b(l) to
be those at log(r/l) = 1.21 and log(r/l) = 1.46 for 19 and 106 states respectively. for larger
values of l > 1 the eects of truncation start to interfere for log r  2.75 and it is not clear
whether we have actually reached the scaling region or not.

3.3.2 the strip with (11, (h)) boundary conditions: massive case

we now consider the strip with boundary conditions (11, (h)), corresponding to a hamilto-
nian

bh(r, , h) =



r(cid:16)l0  c

z=0
(cid:12)(cid:12)12/5
24 + (cid:12)(cid:12) r

(cid:12)(cid:12)6/5
(exp(i)) d + h(cid:12)(cid:12) r

(1)(cid:17) .

(3.29)

the general partition function is now a function of three dimensionless combinations of r,
l,  and h. in the massive case it is convenient to take these as the scaled lengths and the
scaled boundary eld, dened by

with the expectation that

l = m l ,

r = m r ,

bh = h m6/5 ,
log z(11,(h))(r, l, )  r a(l,bh) + b(l,bh) ,

b(l,bh) = log(g11(l, )g(h)(l, ) )

16

(f(bh) + f11) + log( g11(l) g(bh)(l) ) . (3.32)

(3.30)

(3.31)

to simplify matters, in this section we will only discuss the model with a purely bulk pertur-
bation, so that h = 0. this corresponds to the value b = 1/2 of the ir boundary parameter
dened in eqn. (4.4). in gure 7 we show the spectrum of the model with these boundary
conditions and truncation to 81 states (the rst excited state here is actually a boundary
bound state). examining d log(z(r, l))/dr, we nd that, as before, for small values of l there
is a scaling region in r which broadens with increasing l before truncation eects intervene.
for 140 states, the small l scaling region is centred on log(r/l)  1.38 while for large l trun-
cation eects occur for log r  1.5. for small l we can clearly see that scaling has set in and
can be condent that we can estimate a(l) and b(l) using the values at the midpoint of the
scaling region. for large l we can assume that the best guesses of a(l) and b(l) are given by
their values at either (a) the small l eective value of r, or (b) the largest value of r before
truncation eects are obvious. in other words we consider the two estimates of re (l) dened
by

(a) log re (l) = 1.38 + log l ,

and (b) log re (l) = min( 1.38 + log l , 1.5 ) .

in gures 8 and 9 we plot a(l) and db/dl using these two methods. we see that this second
method of taking the best guess at the large l values gives quite pleasing results for these
two quantities while having the problem that the errors are hard to estimate. in gure 10
we plot log(g11(l) g(0)(l)) using method (b) and compare the results using the tba value of
f and a tted value as was used in [4]. as we see, the large l behaviour of the g-function
appears to be improved by using a tted value of f, but again the errors induced by doing
this are unknown.

in table 2 we give the coecients in the power series expansion (3.4) as found from the

the result of extrapolating these coecients to innite level.
combined with the results for dm in table 1 we can then estimate the coecients (c0mdm)
which appear in the expansion of the ratio log(g(h)/g11). these are compared with the results
from the tba in section 5, table 7.

(11, (h)) boundary conditions: massless case

we now consider the (11, (h)) model with the bulk massless. for this case, the three combi-
nations (3.30) do not make much sense, and it is better to consider the system as a function
of the two variables

er = r/l = r/l ,

eh =bh l6/5 = h l6/5 .

as was shown in gure 1(b) of our previous paper [4], the spectrum of bh here is real foreh
positive, and for eh  1 approaches that of the strip with (11, 11) boundary conditions. for
suciently negativeeh, the spectrum becomes complex.

the hamiltonian on the circle is unperturbed if the bulk is massless, and so the ground

state energy on the circle is simply given by (2.10):

(3.33)

similarly the massless limit of the linear term in g, (lfb), is simply given by (4.21), so that
(3.31) and (3.32) become

c00 and c10 are really quite good but the tcsa under-estimates the value of c20 by about 15%
and the value of c30 by a similar amount. however, the tcsa estimates are still increasing
quite fast with truncation level and would probably agree better on increasing the truncation
level.

4 the tba approach to g-functions

the tba is an alternative to conformal perturbation theory and is characterised by its use
of ir scattering data - the bulk scattering matrix of the massive particles, and the reection
factors describing the scattering of the particles o the boundaries.

exact tba equations describing the g-function ow for both massive and massless bulk
were proposed in [3], following on from earlier work in [15]. the derivation of these equations
(which we recall briey in section 4.2) involved a number of assumptions, but to date only
some simple limiting behaviours have been checked. we will perform a more detailed analysis
for the yang-lee case, which will lead to the conclusion that the equations of [3] do not tell
the whole story in every situation.

4.1 the yanglee scattering data

as a massive scattering theory, the yanglee model can be thought of as a reduction of
the sine-gordon model at coupling constant 8/ = 3/2 (in the normalisation of [16]). the

20

bulk spectrum reduces to a single particle (the rst sine-gordon breather) with twoparticle
smatrix [17]

in [4], the boundary reection factors corresponding to the boundary conditions (h) and 11
discussed in the previous sections were identied as

s() = (1)(2) , (x) =

in [4] the relation between b and h was conjectured on the basis of numerical ts to be

an exact formula for hc was also proposed, though no derivation was given; that gap will
be lled in section 4.3.5 below. taking b real gives |h|<|hc|m 6/5; to obtain h<|hc|m 6/5 or
h>|hc|m 6/5 we take b=3ibb and b=2+ibb (withbb real) respectively.
the massless limit is obtained by taking m l = l  0 while keepingeh constant, where
since |h/(hcm )|   in this limit, b takes the values 3  ibb and 2 + ibb foreh > 0 andeh < 0
foreh > 0, with b = 3  ibb, we have sin(

reection process and (in particular) we can no longer expect to nd a real spectrum in the
ir limit, which was indeed what was found in [4] in the tcsa analysis of the spectrum in

the massless case witheh < 0.

4.2 the tba for g-functions

the starting-point for the tba analysis of [3, 15] was the generalisation of the bethe-ansatz
quantisation equation for particles on a line segment of length r  . far from the end
points, the scattering is characterised by a two-body s-matrix element; information about
the reection of the particles at the end points is encoded in the reection factors r() and
r(). the main dierence with the standard tba analysis is that the quantity of interest
is a sub-leading term (order 1/r with respect to the bulk quantities) of the free energy.

the initial assumption is that a particle state can be approximated in the thermodynamic
limit (r  ) by a distribution of particles in scattering states of given rapidities satisfying
self-consistency equations which simultaneously dene a density of possible particle states
() and a density of occupied particle states r(), related by

2() = 2() + 2m r cosh  + () + ()  2(2) +z 



r()(  )d , (4.10)

() = i

d
d

log s() ,

() = i

d

log r() .

assuming that the number of allowed states with eective particle density r() is n [r()],
one can write the partition function as an integral

z = xstates

el e =z d[r()] n [r()] el e[r()] ,

(4.11)

where the energy of the conguration is e = r 0 (m cosh ) r() d . the standard tba
method is to calculate n [r()] by taking the number of allowed congurations in the interval
 with a xed number of occupied states rr() to be

(r())!

(rr())!(r()  rr())!

,

(4.12)

and replacing the factorials by the two leading terms log (z)  z log z  z + . . . of stirlings
formula, so that the total number of congurations with a given eective density r() is

n [r()]  exph z 

0

( log   r log r  (  r) log(  r)) di .

(4.13)

we can then calculate z in the limit r   by the saddle point method, giving the leading
behaviour

log z  recirc

there are a number of possible sources of error in this expression. firstly there are possible
corrections from the next-to-leading term ( log z/2) in stirlings formula, and secondly from
the corrections to the saddle point evaluation of the integral in (4.11). finally, the initial
assumption that the hilbert space for the model on a line segment can be satisfactorily
approximated by scattering states might be wrong. unfortunately we do not as yet know
how account for these eects in a consistent way.
in [3] they were formally bypassed by
assuming that they give an overall contribution (also appearing in the periodic case) which
can be neglected when considering changes in the g-functions. further problems may arise due
to the presence of boundary bound states; again, these were neglected in the above discussion.
in section 4.3.1 below the corrections that are necessary for the yanglee model in this case
will be found empirically, but a rst-principles treatment is still lacking. with these caveats,
equations (4.15) and (4.16) form the prediction of [3].

4.3 properties of the tba g-functions

from (4.15) and (4.16) it is possible to derive several analytic properties of the tba g-
functions.

in section 4.3.1 we examine possible ambiguities in the g-functions, and give the prescrip-
tion which we have adopted in this paper. in section 4.3.2, under the assumption that the
tba g-functions are the sum of a term linear in l and a term which is regular in l6/5, the
coecient of the linear term is evaluated analytically. this enables us to dene the tba
g-functions, which are directly comparable with the tcsa results.
the behaviour of l() in the uv and ir limits is well understood so it is possible to nd
the net change in the g-functions along the ow. the g-functions in eqn. (4.16) suer from
ambiguities due to the possibility to change the integration contour, but we show in section
4.3.3 that there are no contours for which the net change in the tba g-functions agrees with
the tcsa result.

in section 4.3.5 we show that the expression for the ratio log(g(h(b))(l)/g11(l)) is rather
simpler than that for the two g-functions separately, as was also the case in the perturbed

23

conformal eld theory analysis. this enables us to make an expansion in the massless case
and obtain the analytic value of hc dened in eqn. (4.4).

we give some numerical power series ts to the tba results in section 4.3.6, and nd a

combination of functions which appears to be regular in l12/5.

finally in section 4.3.7 we discuss the singularities that occur in g(h) for suciently

negativebh and relate these to the singularity in the ground-state energy on the strip observed

in [4].

4.3.1 the contour prescription for the g-functions

if we examine the formula (4.16) for the g-function in a little more detail, we notice a couple
of immediate problems. firstly, the two distinct boundary conditions (h(b = 0)) and 11 are
described by the same reection factor and hence have the same kernel function 0, yet have
dierent g-functions. secondly, b describing the (h(b)) boundary condition has poles which
are bdependent and (in particular) cross the real axis for b = 1. this means that taking the
naive interpretation of (4.16), with the integration contour always along the real axis, will lead
to g-functions which are discontinuous at b = 1 whereas the physical g-functions should be
continuous in b. the resolution of these two problems appears to be that the contour in (4.16)
depends on the boundary condition, and in particular is dierent for the 11 and (h(b = 0))
boundary conditions. changing the integration contour will mean encircling some of the poles
of b, the poles so encircled being called active, in analogy with the terminology adopted
in [20] in a related context.

the exact choice is, at this stage, a matter of trial and error. in section 4.3.3 we show
that there are no choices which will give the same g-functions as the tcsa, but with the
following prescription at least the ratios of g-functions agree:

1. the 11 boundary condition

we take log(g11) to be given by the straightforward application of (4.16), that is

log(g11) =z 

(cid:16) 0()  (2)  ()(cid:17) l() d

4 ,

with the integration contour along the real axis.

2. the (h(b)) boundary condition

we take log(g(h(b))) to be given by (4.16) for 3 < b <1, that is

log(g(h(b))) =z 

(cid:16) b()  (2)  ()(cid:17) l() d

4 , 3 < b < 1 ,

with the integration along the real axis. for all other values of b, it is given by the

analytic continuation of this function. in particular, forbh>|hc| (i.e. b=3ibb) in the
massive case, and foreh > 0 in the massless, the integration contour may again be taken

along the real axis.

24

the simplest way to derive the continuation of log(g(h(b))) is to isolate the terms in the
integrand which have bdependent poles and treat these separately. we have

b() = 0()  (  i b+3

6 )  ( + i b+3

6 ) ,

so that for 3 < b <1,

log(g(h(b))) = log(g11) z 

(cid:16)(  i b+3

6 ) + ( + i b+3

(4.17)

6 )(cid:17)l() d

4 .

when the integration contour is along the real axis (but not necessarily otherwise) the two
terms in the integral (4.17) give the same contribution, so at least for 3 < b <1 we have

log(g(h(b)))  log(g11) = z 



(  i b+3

6 ) l() d

2

(4.18)

the term in the integral (  i b+3
 = i b5

 = i b1

6 + 2ni ,

6 + 2ni ,

6 ) has poles at

 = i b+1

6 + 2ni ,

 = i b+5

6 + 2ni . (4.19)

this means that as  passes from b < 1 to b > 1, the contour must deform away from the
real axis to avoid a discontinuity from the pole at  = i(b+1)/6, or equivalently the pole at
i(b+1)/6 is active for b > 1, and similarly the pole at i(b1)/6 is active for b > 1, as
shown in gure 14.
note that the poles that are active are exactly those associated with boundary bound
states [4, 21]. it is clear that the transition of a scattering state into a boundary bound state
is always associated with a pole in  crossing the real axis, and in this case the converse is
also true. (recall that the general interpretation of simple poles can be subtle, and not all
correspond to boundary bound states  see [21].) hence, this seems the natural prescription
for the integration contour in the presence of such bound states and it would be interesting
to arrive at this result from rst principles and check it in further models.

4.3.2 analytic structure of the tba g-functions.

we expect the g-functions as evaluated in the tba to be regular functions of l6/5 after the
removal of an extensive part, linear in l. thus they should have the form

under this assumption, the coecient of the linear term can be evaluated analytically as

log g = lf + log g .

(4.20)

independent of the contour prescription we choose. in the massless limit, using (4.6) we nd

4.3.3 net change in the tba g-functions along the ows
given (4.16), it is straightforward to calculate log(g) in the two limits l  0 and l

(4.22)

(4.23)

the uv limit depends on the choice of integration contour in (4.16). although we have given
above a particular prescription for the contours, no matter which contour is chosen, one must
end up with

while the ir result is simple,

therefore the most general prediction of (4.14) would be an interpolating ow

26

there are two distinct physical situations: massless bulk and massive bulk.

(4.21)

(4.24)

(4.25)

1. massless bulk

there is a single identiable massless ow with eh > 0, from  to 11, for which (2.30)

gives

log(g)  log(g11) = log( 1+5

2

(4.26)

) ,

and which is in agreement with (4.25) for n = 4.

2. massive bulk

for the massive ows from 11 and from (h) withbh>|hc|, gu v are given by conformal

eld theory, and our expectation that for the massive theory g|ir = 1 (already proposed
in [4] and well-supported by the tcsa results) leads to the results

log(g11)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)uv  log(g)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ir
log(g(h))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)uv  log(g)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ir

these are in contradiction with (4.25).

8 log 5 .

(4.27)

thus we see that the tba equations (4.15) do not agree with the tcsa even at the level of
the overall change in the g-functions without investigating ner detail.

we note however that the ratio log(g(h)/g11) also changes by log( 1

2 (5 + 1)) along a

massive ow, so the tba equations do have the possibility to describe the ratio correctly,
and indeed we shall nd supporting evidence for this later on.

4.3.4 the relation of the tba g-functions to the yfunction

having written the ratio of the g-functions in the form (4.18), we observe that the integral
on the right hand side is exactly of the form appearing in the tba equation determining the
pseudo-energy :

log(g(h(b)))  log(g11) = z 


= (i b+3

6 ) l() d

2

(  i b+3
6 ) + l sin( b
6 ) .

(4.28)

if we absorb the linear term into the g-functions following (4.20) we obtain exactly the g-
functions, so that the g-functions which follow from the tba equations of [3] predict the
particularly simple form for the ratio of the g-functions

log(cid:0)g(h(b)) /g11(cid:1) = (i b+3

6 ) = log y (i b+3

6 ) .

(4.29)

the same result was also obtained in [14] by a dierent method, but with the restriction
to the massless case. given this, the extension (4.29) to the massive case is perhaps not so
surprising, but the derivation via the tba seems unrelated to the methods of [14]. just to
nish this section, we comment that we have subjected (4.29) to several tests outlined in later
sections, all of which support this identity.

4.3.6 series expansions of ingredients of the tba expressions

in an attempt to understand better the discrepancies between the tba results and those
from other approaches, we have investigated numerically the various ingredients of the tba
g-functions. the aim was to determine their analytic structure by various power series ts in
the variables x  l12/5 and y  hl6/5. these results give highly accurate determinations
of the rst few coecients, but the accuracy rapidly tails o.
in each case we initially assumed an analytic expansion in x1/2 with the addition of
possible non-analytic terms of the form x5n/12, with the results given in table 4. on the
basis of these results we then performed a t to more restricted functional forms (with fewer
non-analytic terms) with the results as in table 5. finally, we know on theoretical grounds

28

that (i(b + 3)/6) has an expansion in x and h and we give the numerical determination of
these coecients in table 6.

we immediately notice that with the contour prescription of section 4.3.1, not only does
g11 not have the correct net overall change, but neither is g11 a pure power series in x ().
even sacricing universality, with the lack of such a basic property there is no hope to identify
this quantity with a properly dened g-function.

however, we observe that it is possible to nd a function which has a regular expansion in x
from the various ingredients of the tba. if we drop the term l(0)/2 (which was introduced
in [3] to account for the absence of a zero-momentum single particle state on the strip), and
further, instead of running the contour on the real axis, we instead also encircle the singularity
of 0 at  = i/6 clockwise to pick up an extra contribution l(i/6)  (i/2), we arrive
at the function


for which we nd the expansion

which has (within our accuracy) better prospects of being a purely analytic function of x,

plus a term in x5/12 which we can identify as (3  1) x5/12/2 = (3  1)l/2.

to conclude, the g-functions predicted by the tba equations of [3] do not match the
quantities derived perturbatively in this paper, nor do they have the expected analytic prop-
erties. although we have partial evidence that the latter problem could be overcome with an
ad-hoc contour prescription, at the present stage of our understanding we have no denite
justication for the above-mentioned discrepancies.

4.3.7

singularities for bh < |hc|

in section 4.3.1, we made the following identication in the case of massive bulk:

log(g(h(b)))  log(g11) = (i b+3

6 ) + l sin( b

6 ) .

(4.34)

the tcsa analysis in [4] revealed the existence of a critical value of hm6/5, in the range
08 to 06, for which log(g(h(b))g11) diverges  this was signalled by a pole in a rational
t to the g-function. furthermore, the ground state energy on the strip has a squareroot

30

singularity at some real value of r for hm6/5 < hcm6/5 = 0.68529.. (see section 6 of [4]).
this led us to the conjecture that the singularities in the two quantities occur at the same
critical threshold hcm6/5. armed with relation (4.34) we can now prove this. first note
that the quantity y (, r) = exp((, r)) is entire in ; further, for r  rm real, it has zeroes
on the line im  = 5/6 (or equivalently im  = 5/6), arranged symmetrically about the
imaginary axis. while their exact locations n are not known, for large r a good approximation
is sinh(re n) = (2n + 1)/r (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .). hence as r grows these zeroes move towards
re  = 0.
relevant for (4.34) lies on
the line im  = 5/6. as r increases, the zeroes n of y move along the line im  = 5/6
and at some critical value rc(b) one will pass through (b), so that y ((b), rc(b)) = 0. this
conrms the presence of logarithmic singularities in (4.34), xes the critical threshold at b=2
and proves (through eq. (4.4)) the above mentioned conjecture. a similar analysis shows that
logarithmic singularities appear in the massless h < 0 case too.

suppose now that re b = 2 so that the value (b) = i b+3

5 comparison of tba, cpt and tcsa results

firstly, it is a consequence of [14] that the tba and cpt methods give the same answer for
the g-function along the massless ow. this is borne out by the comparison of our tcsa
data with the tba. however, we nd disagreement between the tcsa and tba predictions
for the massive ows.

on general grounds we showed in section 3 that the perturbative parts of the g-functions,
denoted by g-functions, should have a series expansion for small l in l6/5. however, when we
try to combine the power series expansions for the various ingredients given in section 4.3.6
we see that the g-functions predicted by the massive tba equations of [3] do not have the
correct behaviour. this is compounded by the fact that in the massive case the net change
in the g-functions does not agree with the cft predictions. this leads us to our conclusion
that the g-functions and g-functions given by the massive tba equations of [3] do not agree
with those obtained viewing the theory as a perturbed conformal eld theory.
one of the most natural sources of this discrepancy is from a neglected sub-leading term in
the saddle point evaluation of log z, but we have not been able to calculate such a term. what
is clear is that the discrepancy between the tba and cpt calculations of the g-functions is
independent of the boundary conditions. this is consistent with our observations in tables 7
and 3 that the rst few coecients in the power series expansions obtained from the tba and
tcsa for the ratio of g-functions, log(g(h)/g11) do agree and that the extensive free-energy
terms (the linear behaviour of the g-functions for large l) are also the same in the tba and
tcsa results.

6 conclusions

we have investigated the relation between the g-functions proposed on the basis of a tba
analysis in [3] and those obtained from perturbed conformal eld theory.

we found that the massless case is correctly described by the tba g-functions (up to
an overall constant) but that the massive case is not. however, in all cases, the ratios of g-
functions for dierent boundary conditions of the same model are correctly predicted by the
tba. a consequence of the tba proposal of [3] is that this ratio of perturbative g-functions
should satisfy

this relation is already contained in the results of [14] in the massless case, but the derivation
there seems rather dierent to ours. we have tested (6.1) in the massive case in two ways:
we have compared the power series expansions from ts to the tba data to the perturbed
conformal eld theory and tcsa calculations of these expressions; we have further compared
the ratio of g-functions directly over a range of l using the tba and tcsa. both tests
support (6.1).
we have also found strong support from the tcsa for the correctness of the tba calcu-

lation of the extensive boundary free energy f.

to summarise, we have found strong evidence for the relation

gcft


(l) = gtba



(l) + k(l) ,

where k(l) is an (unknown) function of l vanishing at l = , and which is independent of the
boundary conditions, and where gtba
is the function which results from the equations of [3],
analytically continued from the massless regime. in section 4.3.6 we further conjectured that



g(h(b))

g11

= y (i b+3

6 ) .

(6.1)

gcft


(l) = gtba



(l) + 1

4 l(0)  1

2 ( i

2 ) +ek(l) ,

32

where ek(l) is an (unknown) regular function of l12/5 vanishing at l = , and which is in-

dependent of the boundary conditions, and where again gtba
is analytically continued from
the massless regime. this is just the sort of relation that would arise if the tba prediction
of [3] has neglected some corrections arising as next-to-leading order terms in the saddle-point
evaluation of the path integral giving the partition function. as yet we have not been able to
check this possibility.



one of the unresolved problems we encountered was the correct contour prescription when
the kernel function  contained parameter-dependent poles. the result we found in section
4.3.1 is that it is consistent to take the contour to encircle those poles which correspond to
boundary bound states. as mentioned there, it will be interesting to arrive at this result
from rst principles and check it in further models. however it is clear that no change in this
contour prescription can correct the tba g-functions of [3] which will still have the wrong
net overall change in g along the massive ows.

we should also like to point out that the g-functions we obtain to not satisfy the g

theorem, but since this model is non-unitary that is perhaps no surprise.

another point to mention is that, in the massive case, y (, r) possesses square-root sin-
gularities in the parameter r. these singularities lead to branch-points connecting the bulk
vacuum energy to excited states [20], for which the yfunctions are described by so-called ex-
cited state tba equations [20,22]. it would be nice to understand the role of these excited
branches of y in the framework of boundary theories, especially in the light of the result 6.1
from the discussion in [22] it seems clear that in the massless case the excited branches yn
give the coecients of the boundary state expanded in the eigenstates of the conformal eld
theory conserved quantities, i.e. if h n | is the n-th excited state of the conformal eld theory
and | (h)i is the boundary state for the massless perturbation of the boundary , then (cf.
eq. (4.32))

h 0 | (h)i = h | (h)i = y ( bb

6 )h | 11 i ,

h n | (h)i = yn( bb

6 )h n | 11i .

quite how this generalises to the massive model is not yet clear, but for the ground state we
have given strong evidence for

h | (h)i
h | 11 i

= y (i b+3
6 )

so it is reasonable to suppose that, by analytic continuation in , the same should remain
true in general, i.e.

some preliminary numerical and cpt checks support this conjecture.

h n | (h)i
h n | 11i

= yn(i b+3

6 ) .

the tba for g-functions was used in a recent paper by lesage et al. [23], as part of an
analysis of boundary ows in minimal models. in the light of the doubts raised above, it is
possible that some of their conclusions for cases where the bulk as well as the boundary is
perturbed should now be re-examined. however, since we have deliberately focussed on just
one model in this paper, we will leave these questions for future work.

al. zamolodchikov has recently found the exact correspondence between the uv and ir
parameters in the sine-gordon model based on calculations of the extensive term f from the

33

tba g-functions and from exact results for the expectation value of the boundary eld [24].
since the yanglee model can be viewed as one special case of the sine-gordon model, his
results should include our result relating h, m and b, summarised in equations (4.4) and
(4.33), as a special case. so far, his results are not directly comparable with ours, but they
are of the same functional form, only hc not being identied. a complete comparison between
his results and ours would require the relation between the normalisations of the elds in the
two approaches, and this has yet to be found.
