abstract

we examine the possibility that gauge eld congurations on stacks of parallel dp-branes
support topological solitons. we give an exhaustive list of possible soliton charges for p  6.
we also discuss how congurations carrying the soliton charges can be constructed from
intersecting branes.

1 introduction

one of the most intriguing features of d-branes is that they provide the possibility of em-
bedding super-symmetric gauge theories in various dimensions into string theory [1] (see [2]
for a review). in many cases, these eld theories possess soliton states which are associated
with topologically non-trivial congurations of the elds. the fact that the gauge elds on
d-branes can form such topologically non-trivial congurations appears to be important in

the interpretation of d-brane charges [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and potentially could lead to a deeper
understanding of the origin of the d-branes themselves [8, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12].

the topological charge on the world-volume of a d-brane couples to the space-time
ramond-ramond elds of type ii superstring theory via chern-simons terms in the world-
volume action [13, 14, 15]. this allows an alternative interpretation of the topological charge
as the rr charge due to the presence of lower-dimensional branes which are either suspended
between the higher dimensional branes [16] or embedded in the world-volume of the higher
dimensional branes [13]. an example is the description of bps magnetic monopoles in
d = 4, n = 4 super-yang-mills theory which can be viewed either as conventional bps
monopoles of the coulomb branch of the gauge theory or as d-strings stretched between
parallel d3-branes [16, 17]. also, instantons in that theory can be described alternatively
as either conventional yang-mills instantons or (the t-dual of) d0-branes immersed in the
world-volume of d4-branes [13, 18, 19, 20, 21]. our aim in this paper is to give a complete
topological classication of world-volume defects and their string interpretation for all stable
bps dp-brane states in type iia and iib string theories, with p  6 and which preserve
half of the ten-dimensional n = 2 super-symmetry.

the most general congurations of this type contain m parallel dp-branes each carrying
rr charges n1, . . . , nm. in the limit when their positions coincide, the internal symmetry

group of such a conguration is g = u(n) [1], where n = p ni is the total rr charge.

when the branes are separated to form parallel stacks of n1, n2, . . . coinciding branes, this
symmetry is spontaneously broken to

h = u(n1)  . . .  u(nm)

.

this situation generically allows for the existence of topological defects [22]. the soliton
states arise because the space of classical vacua is a manifold with non-trivial topology. the
vacua, which are eld congurations of the supersymmetric gauge theory with zero potential
energy, are at connection gauge elds residing in the unbroken subgroup of the gauge group
and values of scalar elds which minimise the potential. finiteness of the energy imposes
boundary conditions on any legitimate eld conguration, requiring it to take vacuum values
at innity. the possible boundary conditions are classied by topologically distinct mappings
from the sphere at innity to the space of vacua. this leads to the existence of topologically
distinct sectors in the space of all eld congurations. the charges which distinguish these
sectors take values in the p1 homotopy group of the vacuum manifold.

the instanton charges are related to topologically non-trivial pure gauge elds of the

unbroken subgroup and are classied by

p1(u(n1)  . . .  u(nm))

.

another type of topological defect, called a topological soliton, is classied by mappings
from the sphere at innity to the space of equilibrium values of internal scalar elds. if the
positions of branes are held xed, the classical vacua are parametrised by the coset space
u(n)/u(n1)  . . .  u(nm) and the soliton states are classied by the homotopy groups

p1(u(n)/u(n1)  . . .  u(nm))

2

we remind the reader that topological arguments alone do not guarantee the existence of
stable solutions of the classical equations of motion in a given topological sector.

the homotopy groups of a coset space g/h occur in exact sequences of the bration

g  g/h:

. . .  p1(g)

f1 p1(g/h)

f2 p2(h)  . . . .

(1.1)

in all of the cases which we shall consider, the exactness of this sequence unambiguously xes
the necessary homotopy groups. also, certain information about the nature of the resulting
topological solitons can be obtained from the structure of the homomorphisms f1 and f2.

if f1 is an isomorphism, the corresponding topological defects are instantons of the broken
gauge group [23]. indeed, the homomorphism f1 is induced by the projection map g  g/h.
an explicit realization of the projection map is

u 7 u 1iu

,

where i is a set of diagonal n n matrices. interpreting the eigenvalues of i, i = 1 . . . 9p
as transverse coordinates of n d-branes and denoting by i corresponding scalar elds in the
world-volume theory, we nd that a eld conguration going to the pure gauge at innity:

i  u 1iu,

a  u 1du,

carries a topological charge taking values in p1(g/h). the homotopy class of this cong-
uration coincides with the homotopy class of the gauge transformation u at innity which
takes values in p1(g).

for n suciently large, the homotopy groups responsible for instantons are periodic in

p [24]:

1(u(n)) = 3(u(n)) = 5(u(n)) = z.

(1.2)

thus, topological arguments suggest that there are instantons on even-dimensional branes.
there are following exceptions for low n:

k(u(1)) = 0 (k > 1),

4(u(2)) = 5(u(2)) = z2.

(1.3)

the exceptional case of n = 2, p = 5 is discussed in sec. 6.

on the string side, instantons are described by d0-branes embedded inside dp-branes
[13, 18, 19, 25, 20, 21]. as was mentioned in [4], the bott periodicity (1.2) of the homotopy
groups n(u(n)) appears to be encoded in the string description, since 0-branes exist in
type iia string theory and can only couple to even-dimensional branes.

if f2 is an isomorphism, so that

or, more generally, if f2 is an onto mapping, so that

p1(g/h) = p2(h)

,

p1(g/h) = p2(h)/p2(g)

,

the corresponding defects are generalised monopoles, as explained in sec. 2, and the generic
case is described by open d1-branes stretched between adjacent higher-dimensional branes.

3

again, the d-brane picture matches the topological consideration, since, on the string side,
we expect to nd monopoles on odd-dimensional branes of type iib theory. on the other
hand, the stable homotopy groups responsible for monopoles are

p1(u(n)/u(n1)  . . .  u(nm)) = ( z m1, p odd

p even

0,

.

(1.4)

for completeness, we sketch the calculation of these groups in appendix a.

2 monopoles on d-branes

the potential of the super-yang-mills theory has the form

v  tr
xi

(di)2 xi<jhi, ji2


and is minimised by classical elds i i = 1, ..., 9  p which commute with each other and
are therefore simultaneously diagonalisable. their distinct eigenvalues, i
a, a = 1, ..., m, each
with degeneracy n1, .., nm are the positions of the m stacks of parallel dp-branes. in a eld
conguration with a topological defect, the scalar elds must minimise the potential at in-
nite distances from the location of the defect and deviate from the minimum inside the core.
even though the eigenvalues of i must therefore approach constants at innity, generally,
the scalar elds themselves approach non-diagonal matrices i = u 1iu. furthermore, to
minimise the classical energy, these matrices must be covariant constants. the gauge elds
therefore approach pure gauges a  u 1du.

generally, u is not dened globally on the sphere at innity, sp1, but must have a
singularity at some point on sp1. in this case, the singular gauge transformation which
passes to the unitary gauge by removing u and leaving i diagonal creates a dirac string.
in this gauge, both the dirac string and the gauge eld at innity carry magnetic uxes
in the unbroken subgroup h. this is a result of the fact that, from the denition of the
boundary homomorphism f2 [24], the singularity of u resides in the unbroken subgroup h.
this denes a mapping v from the sphere sp2 which links the intersection of the dirac
string with sp1 to h. if the homotopy class of this mapping is represented by an integral
over sp2 of the (p  2)-form tr p2, where  = v 1dv , then it is equal to the magnetic

ux through the sphere at innity, rs p1 tr f (p1)/2, where f is the eld strength in the

unbroken subgroup and the gauge eld approaches  on sp2. the structure of the mapping
f2 between homotopy groups is such that, when it is an isomorphism, the magnetic ux
in the unitary gauge is equal to the topological charge of the defect. the corresponding
topological defects are generalised magnetic monopoles. if f2 is not an isomorphism, the
topological charge is equal to the magnetic ux modulo an instanton number of the gauge
eld a.

these generalised monopoles are described by d-strings stretched between stacks of dp-
branes, where p is odd. to show that such congurations of branes are possible, we have
to slightly generalise the rules for d-strings to end on dp-branes [26] to allow for coincident
higher-dimensional branes.

the derivation follows [16] and is based on the fact that rr two-form c couples to

odd-dimensional branes via world-volume chern-simons term [13]:

dimensional d-brane, the charge conservation condition,

ij i0 = 0,

(2.3)

can only be satised if the eld strength f has a singularity at the point where the d-string
terminates. integrating over an eight-sphere surrounding the end point of the d-string, we
get:

if the d-string terminates on a d3-brane
if the d-string terminates on a d5-brane

where the integral is over the sphere surrounding the end-point of the d-string on the dp-
brane. the right hand side is the monopole charge, so, the end point of a d-string looks like
a magnetic monopole.

the above consideration concerns d-strings ending on one stack of dp-branes. the d-
string stretched between two stacks of n1 and n2 coincident branes describes a monopole of
u(n1), which corresponds to one end of the string, and an anti-monopole of u(n2), which
corresponds to the other end. the monopole arising due to symmetry breaking u(n1+n2) 
u(n1)  u(n2) has precisely the same quantum numbers.

in the subsequent sections we classify all possible defects, both monopoles and instantons,

on dp-branes with p  6.

3 2-branes

the only possible defects on d2-branes are instantons classied by 1(u(n)) = z. ob-
viously, they are associated with u(1) factor in u(n). relevant degrees of freedom are
described at low energies by free super-symmetric abelian gauge theory. the localised clas-
sical eld congurations carrying the instanton charge are unstable in the free theory. this
instability in the d-brane picture is reected in the fact that the fundamental string has a
tachyonic mode for a 0-brane embedded in the world-volume of a 2-brane [27].

it is worth mentioning that d0-branes embedded in dp-branes can also be associated with
delocalized magnetic ux [28, 29, 30, 31, 32] and a 2-brane carrying a 0-brane charge can be
described in this way [28]. the congurations of this type either require the niteness of the
d-brane volume or carry an innite rr charge and do not fall into the class of topological
defects that we consider.

5

4 3-branes

the only non-trivial 2 group is 2(g/h) = 1(h)/1(g) = z m1, which is responsible for
magnetic charges in n = 4, d = 4 yang-mills theory. dierent states carrying these charges
were studied from the string-theory point of view in great detail [17, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38].

5 4-branes

the d4-branes possess internal instanton charges associated with 3(u(n)) = z. it worth
noting that we regard instantons as static eld congurations with nite energy, rather than
euclidean solutions with nite action in one dimension lower. these two types of topological
defects are related by t-duality in the time direction which transforms bound states of d0
and dp branes into bound states of d-instantons and d(p-1) branes, congurations recently
discussed in the context of ads/cft correspondence [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 32].

if there are coincident branes (some ni  2), the instantons can always be colour-rotated
to the unbroken subgroup and there are stable classical solutions with any instanton charge.
the homotopy group 3(g/h) is trivial in this case. the reasoning is the same as in
appendix a. if all the branes are separated (ni = 1) we have the short exact sequence

p1(u(1)n )  p1(u(n))

f1 p1(u(n)/u(1)n )  p2(u(1)n )

k
0

(p > 3).

k
0

(5.1)
thus, 3(u(n)/u(1)n ) = 3(u(n)) and corresponding topological defects are instantons of
the broken group.

instantons in the higgs model, as classical solutions of the eld equations, are unstable
and tend to shrink to a point. the size of an instanton and other instanton moduli are
described by vacuum expectation values of elds on the 0-brane world line coming from
fundamental strings stretched between the 0- and 4-branes [19, 20, 46]. the reason for the
instability of an instanton on separated branes is the generation of masses for moduli elds
(except for the instanton coordinates) proportional to the separation between the 0- and
4-branes [20, 46]. the existence of these masses is what forces the instanton to shrink to a
point.

6 5-branes

it is necessary to consider the cases n = 2 and n > 2 separately.

6

6.1 n > 2

if n > 2, the homotopy groups 4(g/h) can be determined from the long exact sequence

4(g)  4(g/h)

f2 3(h)  3(g)  3(g/h)

(n > 2, n2 > 0),

(6.1)
where n2 is the number of branes with rr charge ni  2. we assume that n2 > 0, otherwise
4(g/h) = 0, as follows from the same exact sequence. we nd that

4(g/h) = 3(h)/3(g) = z n21

.

therefore, the homotopy groups are responsible for monopoles. the states carrying monopole
charges are described by d-strings stretched between adjacent stacks of coincident branes.

6.2 n = 2

the homotopy groups 4(u(2)) = 4(u(2)/u(1)2) = z2 (the second equality follows from the
short exact sequence (5.1)) allow for z2 instantons on 5-branes. in the eld theory language,
the non-trivial element of 4(u(2)) can be represented as an instanton-anti-instanton pair
rotated through 2 and then annihilated [48].

as far as 4 is considered, we can make no dierence between u(2) and su(2) = s3.
the topological classication of maps from s4 to s3 is given by freudenthal theorem [49].
the easy part of the freudenthal theorem states that the suspension map

 : 3(s2)  4(s3)

(6.2)

is an epimorphism.
it follows from the dicult part of the freudenthal theorem that
the kernel of this epimorphism is the mapping with the instanton number 2, which infers
4(s3) = z2. the suspension of the mapping with the instanton number 1 represents the
only non-trivial element of 4(s3).

to construct the non-trivial map from s4 to s3 we can use the isomorphism 3(s3) =
3(s2).
if u(x) represents the canonical generator of 3(su(2)), then  : x 7 u 13u
denes the mapping from s3 to s2, the suspension of which, , is the unique non-trivial
element of 4(s3). explicitly, the suspension of  can be realized as a mapping  : (x,  ) 7
u 1 e 2i3 u.

if  is thought of as one of the coordinates on the 5-brane, the gauge transformation at
innity which is equal to unity for  < 0 and for  > 1 and to v = u 1 e 2i3 u for 0 <  < 1
denes non-trivial element of the homotopy group 4(u(2)). the eld conguration which
goes to the pure gauge

  v 1v,

a  v 1dv

at innity will carry z2 charge. here  = l3, where l is the distance between branes.
for a given  the elds in this conguration are that of an instanton-anti-instanton pair

discrete theta-angle in 5-dimensional eld theory on a 4-brane associated with 4(u (2)) was discussed

in [47].

with the instanton rotated through the angle 2 , since the elds of the rotated instanton
dene the pure gauge at innity e 2i3 u, while the anti-instanton corresponds to the pure
gauge u 1. thus, z2 instanton on two 5-branes can be constructed as follows. at some
point inside 5-brane volume the instanton-anti-instanton pair is created, then instanton and
anti-instanton are separated and the instanton is adiabatically rotated through the angle 2,
after which the pair is annihilated (g. 1).

this interpretation readily suggests a brane picture of the z2 instanton. the trajectory
of an instanton corresponds to the d1 brane, as can be established using t-duality. the
gauge orientation of the instanton is described by a vacuum expectation value of one of the
massless modes of the 1-5 fundamental strings. thus, we conclude that the z2 instanton is a
closed d1 brane inside two coincident d5 branes (or between two separated d5 branes) with
a non-trivial conguration of low-energy modes of the fundamental string stretched between
the d1 and d5 branes. it is these modes of the fundamental string that are responsible for
the topological stability of the z2 instanton. the topological stability does not imply that
there is a non-singular eld conguration with minimal energy in the sector with non-trivial
z2 charge. the d-string loop, most probably, will tend to shrink to a point, although it will
not be able to annihilate.

7 6-branes

as follows from (1.2), (5.1), 5(u(n)) = z = 5(u(n)/u(1)n ), except for n = 2 when
5(u(2)) = z2 = 5(u(2)/u(1)2). these homotopy groups are responsible for instantons
(z2-instantons in n = 2 case) on d6 branes. scaling arguments show that localised instan-
tons are unstable [25]. on the string side, this is reected in the fact that d0 branes always
repel from d6 branes [27]. again, as in the case of instantons on d2 branes, it is possible to

8

construct delocalized stable solutions of low-energy equations of motion [25].

considering the homotopy groups 5(g/h) we have to distinguish two cases: n3 > 0 and

n3 = 0. here n3 denotes a number of d6 branes with rr charge ni  3.

7.1 n3 > 0

consider the exact sequence

5(h)

 5(g)

f1 5(g/h)

f2 4(h)  4(g)

k

(n3 > 0),

(7.1)

where 2 is the number of branes with rr charge ni = 2. since the generator of the
homotopy group 5(u(n)) can be represented by a u(n) matrix of the form

u(x) =   (x) 0

1 ! ,

0

where  is a 3  3 matrix, the rst homomorphism in the chain (7.1) covers the entire 5(g)
group. hence, f1 is a trivial mapping: im f1 = 0, and the boundary homomorphism f2 is an
isomorphism in this case:

5(g/h) = 4(h) = (z2)2.

thus, there are 2 species of z2 monopoles on such congurations of d6 branes.

we should impose unitary gauge in order to interpret z2 monopoles in the d-brane pic-
ture. for simplicity we consider the case of 2 = 1. passing to the unitary gauge leaves a
dirac string with the pure gauge of the unbroken u(2) subgroup around the string represent-
ing the non-trivial element of 4(u(2)). just as in sec. 6, we can use the suspension map
 : 3(u(2)/u(1)2)  4(u(2)) to construct a eld conguration carrying the monopole
charge. consider the volume of a 6-brane as the world-volume of a 5-brane. the mag-
netic charges of 5-brane monopoles take values in 3(u(2)) and, hence, have a colour u(2)
orientation.
if we take a monopole and an anti-monopole created at some point on the
6-brane, separate them, adiabatically rotate the colour orientation of the monopole through
2, and then annihilate the pair; the u(2) pure gauge on the surface (homeomorphic to s4)
surrounding the trajectories of the dirac strings of the monopole and the anti-monopole will
be u 1 e 2i3 u, where u is initial colour orientation of the monopole and  is the time
direction on the 6-brane. this pure gauge represents a non-trivial element of 4(u(2)) (see
sec. 6).

since monopoles on 5-branes are represented by open d-strings, the monopole loop on
the 6-brane, which carries z2 magnetic charge, corresponds to a cylindrical open d2 brane
stretched between d6 branes with rr charges ni = 2 and nj > 2 (such a d6 brane exists,
since n3 > 0), see g. 2. the d2 brane is protected from shrinking to a point by vacuum
expectation values of massless modes of 2-6 fundamental strings.

7.2 n3 = 0
in this case g = u(22 + 1) and h = u(2)2  u(1)1, where 1 is a number of charge 1
branes. we can assume that 2 > 0, since the case of u(n)/u(1)n is considered above.

the rst homomorphism in the exact sequence (7.1) is trivial now, since n3 = 0, and we
conclude that 5(g/h)/z = (z2)2. this leaves two possibilities: (1) 5(g/h) = z  (z2)2
or (2) 5(g/h) = z  (z2)21.
in a special case of 1 = 2 = 1 the vacuum manifold
is u(3)/u(2)  u(1) = cp2 and the latter possibility is realized: 5(cp2) = z [24].. in
general, we also have:

5(g/h) = z  (z2)21.

(7.2)

the proof of this equality is sketched in appendix b.

part of the topological defects carrying charges of homotopy groups (7.2) are instantons
and are described by embedded d0 branes and part of them are z2 monopoles described by
open d2 branes stretched between adjacent charge 2 d6 branes.

there is, however, one subtlety. consider, for brevity, the case of 2 = 1, so that
g = u(n) and h = u(2)  u(1)n 2. the homotopy group 5(u(n)/u(2)  u(1)n 2) is z,
so apparently there are no monopoles. but, since 5(u(n)/u(2)  u(1)n 2)/5(u(n)) =
4(u(2)) = z2, the group 5(u(n)) forms 2z subgroup of 5(u(n)/u(2)  u(1)n 2).
therefore, only defects with even charge are related to large u(n) gauge transformations at
innity and can be interpreted as instantons of the broken symmetry group. the instanton
number, k = 1
it in such a way that the generator of 5(u(n)/u(2)  u(1)n 2) has a unit charge. so, k d0
branes embedded into d6 brane carry charge 2k. odd-charged defects cannot be smoothly
transformed into the unitary gauge. a dirac string with z2 ux is always left. in a sense,
odd-charged defects can be interpreted as fractionally charged instantons.

483 r tr f f f , is equal to one half of the topological charge, if we normalise

8 discussion.

we have presented a complete classication of topological charges on stable bps d-branes
of type ii string theories. in almost all cases it is possible to construct d-brane conguration
representing a state with a given topological charge. the results are summarised in table 1.
generically, embedded topological defects are described either by d0 branes in type iia
theory or by open d1 branes in type iib theory and there are bps states in any charged
sector preserving some part of the super-symmetry.

the exceptions to this rule are z2 instantons on d5 branes and z2 monopoles on d6
branes, which are described by closed d1 branes and by cylindrical open d2 branes, re-
spectively. these branes are necessarily curved and therefore cannot preserve the super-
symmetry. the non-trivial topology of these brane congurations resides in the massless
modes of the fundamental strings stretched between the embedded and embracing branes.

we also nd topological defects on certain congurations of d6 branes which can be
interpreted as fractionally charged instantons and, on the other hand, share common features
with z2 monopoles. we have not been able to nd a d-brane interpretation of these objects.

appendix a stable homotopy groups of ag mani-

folds

in this appendix, we shall sketch the calculation of the homotopy groups n(g/h), g =
u(n), h = u(n1)  . . .  u(nm) for n  5, ni > 2. these groups can be calculated from
the exact sequence of the bre bundle

for odd n = 2k + 1 we consider the exact sequence

g h g/h .

2k+1(h)

f0 2k+1(g)

f1 2k+1(g/h)

f2 2k(h)

k
z m

k

.

(a.1)

k

first, we note that the image of any of the m generators of 2k+1(h) under the homomor-
phism f0 is the canonical generator of 2k+1(g). indeed, the upper left corner immersion
u(n1)  u(n) induces the isomorphism of the homotopy groups

2k+1(u(n1)) = 2k+1(u(n))

for suciently large n1, n. the above statement means that the image of the mapping f0
is the whole group 2k+1(g). the exactness of the sequence, i.e. that im f0 = ker f1, then
implies that f1 is a trivial mapping, im f1 = 0. in turn, im f1 = ker f2, so ker f2 = 0 and
f2 is an isomorphism. this is only possible if

2k+1(g/h) = 0.

(a.2)

which is our rst result.

in the case of even n = 2k we consider the long exact sequence

2k(g)  2k(g/h)

f2 2k1(h)  2k1(g)  2k1(g/h)

k
0

which implies that

consequently,

k

k

k

z m/2k(g/h) = z .

2k(g/h) = z m1.

appendix b homotopy groups 5(u (22 + 1)/u (2)2 

u (1)1)

consider the bre bundle

u(n)/u(2)2 u (1)1

 u(n)/u(2)2  u(1)1

,

and the short exact sequence

5(u(1)1)  5(u(n)/u(2)2)  5(u(n)/u(2)2  u(1)1)  4(u(1)1)

k
0

from which we infer that

k
0

,

(b.1)

5(u(n)/u(2)2  u(1)1) = 5(u(n)/u(2)2)

and we can study the latter homotopy groups instead.

it is instructive to consider separately the case of 2 = 1. from the exact sequence (7.1)

we know that

5(u(n)/u(2))/5(u(n)) = 4(u(2))

and that we have to distinguish between two possibilities:
(1) 5(u(n)/u(2)) = 5(u(n))  4(u(2)) = z  z2
or
(2) 5(u(n)/u(2)) = z.
if n = 2, the homotopy group of interest is z, as u(3)/u(2) = s5, which means that
5(u(3)) is the 2z subgroup of 5(u(3)/u(2)). suppose that 5(u(n)/u(2)) = z  z2
for some n, then 5(u(n)) is the z  {1} subgroup of 5(u(n)/u(2)). the immersion of
u(3)/u(2) into u(n)/u(2) induces a homomorphism of homotopy groups

f : 5(u(3)/u(2))  5(u(n)/u(2)).

since any map from s5 to u(n) can be reduced to the u(3) subgroup, we have: f (2) =
f (1, 0), which leaves no room for f (1) in 5(u(n)/u(2)). thus we conclude that

5(u(n)/u(2)) = z

for any n.

now, consider the bre bundle

u(n)/u(2)

u (2)2 1

 u(n)/u(2)2

.
