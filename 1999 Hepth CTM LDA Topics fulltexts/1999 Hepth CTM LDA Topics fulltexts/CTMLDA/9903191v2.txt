we compute the boundary entropies for the allowed boundary condi-
tions of the su (2)-invariant principal chiral model at level k = 1. we
used the reection factors determined in previous work. as a by-product
we obtain some miscellaneous results such as the ground-state energy for
mixed boundary conditions as well as the degeneracies of the kondo model
in the underscreened and exactly screened cases. all these computations
are in perfect agreement with known results.

1 introduction

boundary integrable models in (1 + 1)-dimensions have attracted some atten-
tion in recent years, especially in view of their successful application to quantum
impurity problems. the typical examples are the kondo model [12], dissipative
quantum mechanics [36], quantum hall liquids with constriction [37] and the
callan-rubakov model [21]. the common minimal denominator in these sit-
uations is the fact that the bulk theory is conformally invariant and it is the
boundary that is responsible for the broken scale invariance. here, our purpose
is to consider the alternative situation, where the boundary respects the confor-
mal invariance of the theory and the renormalization group (rg) trajectory is
controlled by a bulk perturbation. the model in question is the su (2) principal
chiral model (pcm) at level k = 1. in a previous work [27], we proposed the set
of permissible boundary conditions suggested by the symmetries of the problem
and computed the corresponding minimal reection factors that are compatible
with the bulk scale invariant limit (kondo problem). in this work, we wish to
go one step further and study the nite size eects both in the infrared (ir)
and ultraviolet (uv) limits, in analogy with the bulk problem [10]. this is done
by boundary thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) [17]-[19], [26]. to motivate
our conjecture, we compute the boundary entropies for the quasi-particles of the
kondo model in the exactly screened and underscreened cases. this has already
been done by fendley[13]. however, this explicit computation will be used as a
means of comparison for further generalizations.

for one of the boundary conditions the boundary degeneracy is shown to be
noninteger. furthermore, the typical decrease of entropy along the rg ow from
the unstable uv xed point to a more stable ir one is found to be respected.
this g-theorem was conjectured for theories that are scale invariant in the bulk
[20]. however, it also seems to hold here.

finally, we use our results to conjecture the form of the ground state energy
it is found to be in perfect

for mixed boundary conditions in the ir limit.
agreement with boundary conformal eld theory predictions [24].

2 the principal chiral model and the kondo ef-

fect

the integrability of the pcm has been studied by various authors [1]-[11], [15],
[16]. the rg analysis reveals that it interpolates between two xed points.
the crossover between the two limiting behaviours introduces a mass scale that
breaks the conformal invariance. the rg trajectory terminates at the ir xed
point where the theory becomes massless at all distances. it is characterized
by a conformal eld theory based on two su (2)k kac-moody algebras (at level
k). al.b.zamolodchikov and a.b.zamolodchikov [10] proposed the background
factorized scattering in terms of massless particles that leads to the correct tba
equations for k = 1. zamolodchikovs c-function was shown to take the values
cuv = 3 and cir = 1 at the xed points [10], [35]. the latter coincides with

1

the central charge of the su (2)1 conformal eld theory [9].

the multi-channel kondo model [12], [13], on the other hand, consists of a
k-tuple of (1 + 1) free massless fermions on the half-line antiferromagnetically
coupled to a xed impurity of spin s sitting at the boundary (x = 0). let
us denote the coupling constant by . the rg ow interpolates between an
unstable uv xed point, where the impurity is decoupled ( = 0) and a strongly
coupled ir one, where the spin of the impurity is screened ( = 2
k+2 ). the
eective spin thus becomes q = s  k/2. as before, the crossover introduces a
scale tk called the kondo temperature.
for k = 1, the bulk spectrum of both theories consists of stable massless
particles:
left- and right-movers. at level k = 1 the kink structure of the
particles and boundary impurity is eroded. the on-mass-shell momenta of the
particles are parametrised in terms of the rapidity variables  < ,  < :

e = p = m

2 e,

for right-movers,

e = p = m

2 e 

,

for left-movers.

(1)




the right- and left-movers are represented by the symbols ra() and lb(),
respectively, where a, b =  are the su (2) isotopic spin indices.

the su (2) invariant r-r scattering [10] is given by:

ra(1)rb(2) = scd

ab(1  2)rd(2)rc(1),

with

scd
ab() = t ()c

hold for the l-l scattering as well.

in the kondo model the r-l scattering is trivial. however, for the pcm,

we have:

with

u () = tanh(cid:18) 
2 

i

4 (cid:19) .

(6)

(7)

notice that when   , this amplitude becomes trivial.

let us now consider a reecting boundary that preserves the integrability. in
the kondo problem we distinguish two situations [13]. in the exactly screened
case, the impurity spin is completely screened yielding a zero eective spin
(q = 0). the impurity is thus a su (2) singlet.
in the underscreened case
(s = 1), the eective spin is q = 1/2 and the impurity becomes a su (2)
doublet.

in the former case, we dene the operator b which, acting on the vacuum

|0 >, creates a boundary state |b > [23], i.e.:
|b >= b|0 > .

(8)

the reection matrix rb
a() is the amplitude corresponding to a right-mover of
rapidity  and spin a being reected into a left-moving state of rapidity  and
spin b1:
(9)

ra()b = rb

a()lb()b.

the fact that the boundary impurity is a su (2) singlet implies the following
diagonal form:

rb

a() = b

ark(),

where

rk() = u () = tanh(cid:18) 
2 

i

4 (cid:19) .

(10)

(11)

similarly, for the underscreened case, we introduce the operator bb (b = ),
which acting on the vacuum creates a boundary state with spin b. the reection
amplitude rcd

ab() is:

ra()bb = rcd

ab()lc()bd,

rcd

ab() = fk()c

ad

b + gk()d

(14)

fk() = i

 gk(),

gk() = r().




here it is understood that  stands for q  k, where q is the rapidity of the
quasi-particle and k is associated with the kondo temperature, tk = ek .
in the case of the pcm, we know that in the ir limit there are two boundary
conditions compatible with the conformal symmetry [24], [25]. each one of them
is associated with a primary eld of the su (2)1 conformal eld theory. these
elds have conformal dimensions  = 0 and  = 1/4 and have been identied
with the identity operator and the eld g of the wess-zumino-witten action,
respectively [14].

1sum over repeated indices is understood.

the xed boundary condition is associated with a reection amplitude of

the form (9), (10) except that this time [27]:

rp () = exp(cid:18)

i

4 (cid:19) sinh(cid:16) 
sinh(cid:16) 

8 (cid:17)
2  i
8 (cid:17)

.

(15)

similarly, there is an amplitude rcd
condition, which is given by (12), (13), (14) and this time:

ab() associated with the free boundary

gp () = irp ()r().

(16)

3 tba in the l-channel

3.1 fixed boundary conditions
we start by considering a system of n right-movers with rapidities 1, , n
and m left-movers with rapidities 
m in an interval of length r with
xed boundary conditions on both ends. since the reection matrix is diagonal
on both sides, we can assume that the bethe wave function vanishes at the two
extremes of the interval. we can thus impose a standing wave quantization
condition [18]. mathematically, this condition can be expressed in the form:

1, , 

exp(2irpk)r2(k)

1

u(2k)qn
a(k|{}1n )  t a

l=1 u (k + l)qm
b (k|{}1m ) = 1,

pa,b t b

j=1 u (k  

j)

(17)

k = 1, , n.

in the above equations it is understood that a = a and b = b. r() is the
reection amplitude in eq.(10). the term 1
u(2k) arises because the particle
a(u|{}1n ) is a 2n  2n
does not interact with itself. the transfer matrix t b
matrix dened by:

a (u)c1...cn

(18)

and is represented in g.1. each dot represents an interaction described by the

amplitude (3). let us then dene the object:

b


a(u|{, }) = xb(=b)

a (u|{}1n )  t
t b

b(u|{}1m ).

b

eq.(17) can thus be rewritten in the form:

exp(2irpk)r2(k)

1

u(2k)qn
(k|{, }) = 1,

l=1 u (k + l)qm
k = 1, , n,

j=1 u (k  

j)

(19)

(20)

where (u) is the trace of (19). the tba analysis is very similar to the one
carried out in ref.[10]. we reproduce it here for completeness and to make the
generalization to free boundary conditions more transparent.

using the yang-baxter equation we can show that b

a(u) obeys the following

commutation relations:

a

a (u)

b
b (v)s ab

ab (u  v) = sab

ab

b
b (v)a
(u  v)

a (u).

(21)

writing these out explicitly, we have:

+(u), 

[(u), (v)] =(cid:2)+
(cid:2)
(u  v)+
(u  v)

(v)

+(v)(cid:3) =(cid:2)+




+(u), +

+(u) = i

+(v)

+(v) + (u  v  i)
(u) + (u  v  i)

+(v)+

+(u),

+(u)

(v).

(22)

(23)

from these commutation relations we see that it makes sense to nd simultane-
ous eigenstates of (u) for dierent values of u. we start by dening the bare
vacuum state |0 >, which corresponds to a state where all the n + m frame
particles have spin down. we can show that |0 > is an eigenstate of (u):

l=1 t (u  l) qm

(u)|0 >=hqn
+qn

l=1 sv (u  l)qm

j=1 sv (u + 

j)i|0 > .

j=1 t (u + 

j)+

the space of states is constituted by the set of ctitious particle states-magnons-
of the form:

(24)
from eq.(22) we see that the order of the rapidities 1, , p is immaterial. in

|1, , p >= 

+(1) 

+(p )|0 > .

(25)
where 6 j means that this rapidity is omitted. this state will be an eigenstate
of the trace of the combined transfer matrix (19), provided the shifted rapidities
yj = j  i/2 (j = 1, , p ) satisfy

(28)

eq.(26) can be interpreted as the periodicity conditions for the bethe wave
functions of p magnons [10] subject to the diagonal factorized scattering with
magnon-magnon scattering amplitude:

s11(y) =

y + i
y  i

.

(29)

the scattering between the magnons and the frame particles is described by the
amplitude:

s1(y  ) =

y    i/2
y   + i/2

.

(30)

the system (26) has been analyzed in the context of the heisenberg spin chain
[28], [30]. in the thermodynamic limit (n, m, p  ), its solutions are either
the isolated real roots y0, corresponding to the magnon m1(y0) proper rapidity
y0, or the strings of arbitrary number n of roots:

y = y0 +

i
2

,

 = n + 1,n + 3, , n  1,

6

which can be interpreted as the n-magnon bound state mn(y0) (n = 1, 2, ,)
of real rapidity y0. the amplitudes (snm) for the mnmm bound state scatter-
ing and for the scattering between the n-magnons mn and the frame particles
(sn) are given by:
sn(y  ) = yin/2
y+in/2 ,

snm(y) = y+i(m+n)/2

yi(m+n)/2 h y+i(m+n2)/2

 y+i(mn)/2
yi(mn)/2 .
(31)
in the thermodynamic limit, n, m, p  , we introduce the densities n(y)
and the densities of states n(y) of n-magnon bound states (n = 1, 2, ,).
eq.(26) then reads:

yi(mn2)/2i2
yi(m+n2)/2  y+i(mn2)/2

2n = n  0 +



xm=1

mn  m;

n = 1, ,,

(32)

where 0 and 0 are the combined densities for left- and right-movers and the
kernels n, mn are dened as:

n(y) = i 
mn(y) = i 

y log sn(y),

y log smn(y).

the rapidity convolution is given by:

(  )(y) =z +



dy(y  y)(y).

(33)

(34)

we can rewrite eq.(32) in a more tractable form by noticing that if we work
with fourier transforms, convolutions are replaced by ordinary products. we
dene the fourier transform of a quantity a(y) by:

and its inverse by:



a(k) =z +
a(y) =z +

dya(y)eiky,

a(k)eiky .

2 n(k) = exp( n

2 |k|),

(35)

(36)

(37)

then we can show that the fourier transforms of the kernels (33) satisfy the
following identities:

lmn (m, n = 1, 2, ,) is called the incidence matrix.
its elements vanish
unless the nodes m and n are connected (i.e. adjacent) in the diagram of g.2.
it is the straightforward to show that eqs.(32) read:

where (y) is the unied kernel,

(y) =

and where we dened the densities of holes:

n = n  n,

n = 0, 1, ,.

using system (38) we can also obtain the following useful identity:

let us now go back to the set of yang eqs.(20) [29]. we consider as eigenvector
of the combined transfer matrix  the p magnon state (24) with rapidities
y1, , yp subject to the constraints (38). taking into account the fact that
t (0) = 0, we get:

is the entropy of particles and magnons. the magnons being ctitious parti-
cles do not contribute to the energy of the system. however, they account for
the isotopic degrees of freedom and must therefore contribute to the total en-
tropy. to address the constraints (38), (47) we introduce an innite number
of lagrange multipliers (one for each constraint), n() (n = 0, 1, ,) and
rewrite (48) as:

[18]. in the ir limit, when l  , we see from (53) that 0   and so the

it for some positive integer p and eventually take the limit p  . the general
solution is [32]:

1 + yn =

(60)

where a and b are arbitrary constants. they are xed by imposing the initial

(71)

this is in perfect agreement with refs.[12], [20].

before we conclude this section, let us make one remark. notice that, from
(56), (57), the magnons do not contribute to the boundary entropy. this is
because they account for the isotopic degrees of freedom. since for xed bound-
ary condition, the impurity is a singlet, the magnons will not be included. for
free boundary condition, on the other hand, the impurity becomes a doublet.
therefore its spin degrees of freedom contribute to the boundary degeneracy.
we thus expect the magnons to play a role here. indeed, this is what happens,
as we shall see in the next section.

3.2 free boundary conditions

let us now consider the kondo problem with an impurity subject to the free
boundary condition. let us again assume that there are at some instant n right-
1, , 
movers with rapidities 1, , n and m left-movers with rapidities 
m .
then because of the bulk scale invariance we can extend the system to the full
line [12], [13], with the impurity sitting at the origin by considering only say
(n + m ) right-movers of rapidities k (k = 1, , n + m ), where

k = 

kn f or k = n + 1, , n + m.

(72)

suppose now that we place this system in a nite periodic box of length 2r.
the combined transfer matrix b

a(u)(19) is then modied to:

b


a(u|{, }) = xb,b

in components we get:

using the yang-baxter equation and the boundary yang-baxter equation it
is straightforward to show that the commutation relations (21), (22) remain
unalterated. the yang equations can thus be expressed in terms of the trace of
(73) as:

e2irpk (k|{, }) = 1,

the solution of these equations still corresponds to the magnons and the n-
magnons. however we have to take into account the scattering between the
n-magnons and the boundary impurity:

n (y) =

y  in/2
y + in/2

,

n = 1, 2, ,.

(80)

in the thermodynamic limit n, m, p   we get:

(81)

the yang eqs.(75), then read:

20 = lm e + (2)()

where this time:

(2)() = i




log h().

using the identity (83), we obtain from (86):

20 =   1 + (2)()  b() + m le.

the tba equations corresponding to the constraints (82), (88) are:

n + n + 1
0() = lm e,

let us now try to generalize this procedure for the pcm. in this case, we
cannot extend the system to the whole line, because the bulk r  l scattering
is no longer trivial (cf.(6), (7)). however, we can assume that the standing
wave condition (17) still holds if we have free boundary conditions at the two
extremes of the interval. the following simple argument shows that this is
indeed the case.

if the boundary satises the xed boundary condition, the bethe wave func-
tion vanishes there. consequently, it is reected o the boundary with a phase

14

shift of . the other boundary produces another shift of , bringing the bethe
wave function back to its original form. the end result is the standing wave.

for a free boundary the bethe wave function satises a neumann bound-
ary condition corresponding to zero ux of momentum accross the boundary.
consequently, it remains unscathed upon reection (no phase shift).

in summary, after two reections, the bethe wave function nds itself in its
original shape both for free as well as xed boundary conditions, provided the
same condition holds at the two boundaries.

proceeding with the same program that followed eq.(17), we obtain the

following set of bethe equations:

lm e+ 0 + 1
n + 1

2   l1 = 0,
m=0 lmnlm = 0,

2   l0 + 1
2  p

(92)

n = 1, 2, ,.

the evaluation of the boundary free energy yields an expression identical to
(90), except that this time:

(2)() =

log h()

log u (2)

and

b() = i




log h().

(93)

(94)

let us check whether formula (90) together with (89) yields the correct values
of the impurity entropies in the case of the kondo model. first of all notice
that:

(2)
k () = i 

 log sv () = b().

and therefore the term proportional to l0 in the integrand of eq.(90) vanishes.
we are thus left with:

f|boundary = 1

in the u v limit we get:

1 ()l1()d + const.

log g(2)

uv = 1

2  log(1 + x1) + const,

where x1 is given by eq.(65). similarly in the ir limit we have:

log g(2)

ir = 1

where y1 is given by eq.(61). we then have:

(95)

remember that in the u v limit the impurity decouples and its spin is s = 1.
and so, guv = 2s + 1 = 3. on the other hand, in the ir limit the impurity
spin is screened and the eective spin is q = s  k/2 = 1/2. we conclude that
gir = 2q + 1 = 2. these results are in perfect agreement with eq.(95).
let us now go back to the p cm . in this situation, the rst term in the

integrand of eq.(90) does not vanish. in fact we have:

(2)
p ()  b() =

1
i




log hp () 

1
i




log u (2)  b().

(96)

now notice that:

hp () = fp () + gp () = (1 + i

substituting in eq.(93), we get:

4 tba in the r-channel

the previous work allows us to conjecture the set of tba equations in the r-
channel.
in essence they are not very dierent from those in the l-channel.
they arise from imposing periodic boundary conditions on all cooper pairs
of the form ra()lb(), [17]. if 0() is the density of pairs with rapidity
in a small vicinity around , then the tba equations for these pairs and the
n-magnons are:

0+ 0 + 1
1+ 1 + 1
n + 1

2   l0 + 1
2   l0 + 1
2  p

m=1

2   l1 = 0,
2   l2 = 0,
lmnlm = 0;

16

(100)

n = 2, 3, ,.

i



 logr()  1

in the l-channel the particles and magnons contribute with 0() and 1(),
respectively, to the boundary degeneracies. this contribution will translate to
0 and 1 in eq.(100). if i(), associated with a particular boundary condition
, is of the form 1

 logs(2), then its contribution to i()
i
reads logk(), where k() = r(i/2  ).
suppose we have xed boundary condition on one side and free on the other.
the contribution of the free boundary to 1 is logkk() where kk() =
rk(i/2  ) is given by the kondo reection amplitude (11). its contribution
in
to 0 is logkp (), where kp () = rp (i/2  ) is given by eq.(15).
principle its contribution should be loghp (). however, the amplitude in the
logarithm must be the one associated with the kernel in (2)
0 , which was shown
to be rp (97). finally, the xed boundary does not contribute to 1 and its
contribution to 0 amounts to log kp ().

altogether, we have:

(cid:26) 0() = rm e  log(cid:2) kp ()kp ()(cid:3) ,
1() = logkk().

(101)

the saddle point evaluation of the free energy yields:

f = 

l

xn=0

mnz +



deln(),

(102)

where mn  m n,0. let us dene 0() = kp ()kp (), 1() = kk(),
n() = 1, n = 2, 3, , and

n() = n() + logn(),

ln() = log(1 + n()en ).

we can then rewrite eqs.(100) and (102) in the form:

m re + 0 + 1
mnre + n + 1

2   l1 = 0,
m=0 lmn lm = 0;

and

n = 1, 2, ,,

mnz +



de ln().



2   l0 + 1
2  p

f =

(103)

(104)

(105)

now notice that 0() = kp ()kp () = 1 and lim 1() = lim kk() =
1. if we dene zn  en(+), we get the following system in the limit r  :




z0 = 0,
z2
1 = 1 + z2,
z2
2 = (1  z1)(1 + z3),
z2
n = (1 + zn1)(1 + zn+1),

17

(106)

n = 3, 4, ,.

the solution is:

z0 = 0,

z1 = 1,

1 + zn =

sin2(cid:2) (n1)
p+1 (cid:3)

sin2[ 

p+1 ]

;

n = 2, 3, , p.

(107)




similarly, if we dene xn  en(), in the region rm << , we obtain the
system (65), as r  .
as usual, we dierentiate eqs.(104) with respect to  and substitute for mne
in eq.(105), [22], [31]-[35]. after a few algebraic manipulations, we obtain:

f = 

l
4

+

xn=0z n(+)

n()

d(cid:20)log(1 + e) +

e

1 + e(cid:21) .

we now perform the substitution,

  t =

1

1 + e ,

yielding:

f = 

l

2r



xn=0(cid:26)l(cid:20) xn

1 + xn(cid:21)  l(cid:20) zn

1 + zn(cid:21)(cid:27) ,

where l(x) is rodgers dilogarithm:
2z x

l(x) =

dt(cid:20) logt

log(1  t)

this function satises the property

and the following sum rules, [32]:

l(1  x) = l(1)  l(x),

n

xn=1

using l(1) = 2/6, we get:

the ground state energy is thus [1]:

(116)

which is one of the conformal dimensions of the su (2)1 conformal theory. this
is in fact the correct one, according to the predictions of boundary conformal
eld theory, [24], [25].

5 conclusions

let us restate our results. we computed the boundary degeneracies correspond-
ing to the two allowed boundary conditions for the pcm and the kondo model
at level k = 1. this was accomplished by quantizing the system in a nite
box. we argued that for the free boundary condition, the bethe wave function
was subject to a neumann condition preventing the ow of momentum accross
the boundary. this condition allows the exchange of isospin between the par-
ticles and the boundary impurity. since the magnons are attached to these
degrees of freedom, they contribute to the boundary degeneracy. this situation
is in contrast with the xed boundary condition, which does not permit isospin
permutation. the free boundary condition was subsequently shown to yield a
noninteger degeneracy.

we stress that in all cases the boundary entropy decreases under renormal-

ization from the more unstable uv xed point to the more stable ir one.

finally, we used the previous results to conjecture the form of the tba
equations in the l-channel and the ground-state energy, when we place the
system in a nite box with distinct boundary conditions at the two ends. the
boundary conformal eld theory approach of cardy [24] predicts a partition
function of the form zf ree,f ixed = (1)
denotes the su (2)
kac-moody character at level k = 1 associated with the conformal tower labeled
by the primary operator with isospin l = 1
2 . this operator has conformal
dimension [9]  = l(l+1)
4 , in perfect agreement with our result (116). some
of our results may be tested numerically using the truncated systems (61), (65)
and (107). we expect to carry out that program in a future work.
