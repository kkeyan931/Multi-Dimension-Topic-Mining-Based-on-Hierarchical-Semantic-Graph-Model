n 1 = const.k1 suggests that in addition to the massive vacua there exists a re-
maining massless sector in the theory if k > 2. we assume that this massless sector is
described by a landau-ginzburg (lg) theory of central charge c = 3n (1  2/k) with
n chiral elds with u (1) charge 1/k. we compute the topological invariants (elliptic
genera) using lg theory and massive vacua and compare them with the geometrical
data. we nd that the results agree if and only if k =even and n =even.

these are the cases when the hypersurfaces have a spin structure. thus we nd

an evidence for the geometry/lg correspondence in the case of spin manifolds.

introduction

it is well-known that it is possible to reproduce various geometrical data of calabi-yau
manifolds by making using the orbifoldized landau-ginzburg theory. such a correspon-
dence between calabi-yau manifold and the landau-ginzburg theory has been known for
quite some time [1, 2] and has been studied extensively in connection with mirror sym-
metry. a simple explanation of this correspondence was provided some time ago using
the gauged linear sigma model with a fayet-illiopoulos parameter r [3].
in [3] it was
shown that in the limit of large positive values of r the non-linear sigma model on the
calabi-yau (cy) manifold is recovered while the theory reduces to a landau-ginzburg
(lg) type model in the limit of large negative values of r. r has the meaning of the size
of the calabi-yau manifold. since the topological quantities remain invariant under a
smooth variation of the fayet-illiopoulos parameter, one recovers topological invariants of
cy manifolds by studying lg theories.

n : x k

in this article we would like to generalize such a calabi-yau/landau-ginzburg corre-
spondence to a more general class of manifolds. specically in the following we consider
n = 0 in cpn 1 for various value
fermat-type hypersurfaces m k
of k and n . k = n give the n  2-dimensional calabi-yau manifold. when k < n ,
the hypersurface has a positive 1st chern class n  k and is a typical fano variety. we
recall that the (one-loop) beta function of the supersymmetric non-linear sigma model on
a manifold m is proportional to the minus of its 1st chern class. we may then imagine
that a quantum theory on fano variety has a non-zero mass gap due to its asymptotic
freedom.

however, the quantum cohomology relation (restricted to the kahler subring) of the

manifold m k

n is known [4] and given by

n 1 = kkk1

(1.1)

where  is the world-sheet instanton amplitude ( denotes the vacuum value of the scalar
component of the vector multiplet in the linear  model. it corresponds to the kahler
class of m k
n ). (1.1) generalizes the well-known relation for quantum cohomology ring of
cpn 2

n 1 = .

(1.2)

the above equation (1.1) strongly suggests that the theory actually consists of both mas-
sive and massless sectors if k > 2: (i) in the massive sector there exist n  k split vacua
corresponding to the roots of n k = kk of (1.1). (ii) in addition the theory possesses a
massless sector corresponding to the the degenerate solution  = 0 of the relation (1.1).
this massless sector should be described by some conformal eld theory (cft) in the
infra-red limit.

we have to make an identication of this cft describing the massless sector so that
together with the massive sector it should reproduce the geometry of the hypersurface. a
natural candidate for the cft is given by the landau-ginzburg theory consisting of n
chiral elds with the u (1)-charge 1/k corresponding to the dening equation x k
2 +
 + x k
n . this choice seems natural since it gives back the standard cy-lg
correspondence in the case k = n .

during the course of this work we became aware of an article by witten [5] where
he suggests an approach very similar to ours. he further discusses the case of k > n ,
hypersurfaces of general type, where the beta function is positive and the direction of
renormalization group ow is inverted.

in the case of fano varieties n > k, eld theory on the manifold ows in the infra-red
to lg theories. if one assigns the central charge of the free eld theory on the manifold as
cu v = 3(n  2), then the central charge decreases in the infra-red to cir = 3n (1  2/k)
of the lg-theory in accord with the theorem of zamolodchikov. in the case of manifolds
of general type k > n , one ows from the lg theory in the ultra-violet with cu v =
3n (1  2/k) to a free eld theory in the infra-red with cir = 3(n  2) and again the
central charge decreases.
in the following by making use of the lg theory we compute various topological
invariants for fano and general hypersurfaces, i.e. euler numbers, elliptic genera for the
 (signature) and a-genus. method of computation of the elliptic genera in cft/lg
theories are well-known and described in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. we take n to be even so that
the signature and a-genus of the manifold are well-dened. we then compare the results
with the geometrical computation of elliptic genera for the hypersurfaces. geometrical
method of computation may be found in the literature [12, 13].

it turns out that we nd exact agreements between lg theory and geometry if and
only if k=even. note that with n =even the 1st chern class n  k is divisible by 2 when k
is even and the manifold has a spin structure. therefore we have found an evidence that
the geometry/lg correspondence exists in a class of spin manifolds.

we have also examined a few examples of hypersurfaces in a weighted projective space
and again veried the lg/geometry correspondence when the hypersurface has a spin
structure.

2 quantum cohomology relation for hypersurfaces

let us start with the relation of quantum cohomology obtained by collino and jinzenji [4]
for hypersurface. we rst recall that the cohomology classes of hypersurfaces consist of
two classes (1) and (2): elements in the class (1) are generated by the powers of the kahler
class  and are given by {1, , 2, , n 2}. we call this class as the kahler subring
in the following. elements in the class (2) are given by the (p, q)-forms at the middle
dimension, {op,q, p + q = n  2}. let us call them as primitive classes. due to the
lefschetz theorem these elements exhaust the cohomology classes of the hypersurface. in
the quantum cohomology at the genus=0 level these two classes are essentially decoupled
from each other and one can restrict ones attention to the sector of kahler subring.

it is then possible to derive the following relation for the degree k hypersurface (k < n )

n 1 = kkk1.

(2.3)

here  denotes the basic 1-instanton amplitude. we note that eq.(2.3) generalizes the
well-known formula for cpn 2

n 1 = .

3

(2.4)

when one uses the description of the supersymmetric linear sigma model [3],  is replaced
by the scalar eld  of the n = 2 vector multiplet in 2-dimensions.
quantum cohomology relation for cpn 2 (2.4) may be interpreted as the equation for
the minima of a perturbed superpotential w = 1/n  n  . in this case the quantum
deformation corresponds to the most relevant perturbation. at each of the n  1 minima
{j = const  e2ij/(n 1), j = 0, 1, 2 , n  2, const = 1/(n 1)}, the second derivative
of the superpotential does not vanish and the theory has a mass gap. also in the case of
k = 2 the second derivative does not vanish at all minima and the system has a map gap.
however, in the case of larger values of k  3 the perturbation becomes less relevant
and the degeneracy of the vacua is not completely resolved. the perturbed superpotential
w = 1/n  n  kk1k possesses both the n  k massive vacua at {j = const 
e2ij/(n k), j = 0, 1, 2 , n  k  1, const = (kk)1/(n k)} and the degenerate vacua at
the origin  = 0. thus the system has both massive and massless degrees of freedom.

3 landau-ginzburg models

we assume that the massless degrees of freedom are described by the landau-ginzburg
theory corresponding to the tensor product of n copies of n = 2 superconformal minimal
models with level k  2. central charge of this system is given by c = 3n (1  2/k).
let us rst check if the sum of the number of massive vacua and the degenerate
vacua of cft add up to the euler number of the hypersurface. we may use the n = 2
representation theory for the cft sector, however, for the computation of topological
invariants a simple free-eld realization may be used.

let us introduce the ratio of theta functions

euler number

the above formula (3.5) corresponds to an amplitude

zcf t = tr(1)f e2ij0ql0 q

l0

(3.10)

in the superconformal eld theory where f is the sum of left and right-moving fermion
numbers fl + fr and j0 is the zero mode of the u (1) current in the left-handed sector.
zcf t becomes the euler number of the target manifold when  = 0.

if we choose  = 0 in the corresponding formula of lg theory (3.5), all the oscillator
modes in fact cancel and we have contributions only from zeros modes. we set na,b = 1.
then we nd

zlg( = 0) =

(1  k)n

(3.11)

where the rst term comes from the sector a = b = 0 (we use lhopitals rule in evaluating
this contribution) while each of the other sectors contributes 1/k to the second term.

the total number of ground states is the sum of eq.(3.11) and the number of massive
n is

vacua which is equal to n  k. thus the lg prediction for the euler number  of m k
given by

(1  k)n + k2  1

(1  k)n + n k  1

(1  k)n  (1  kn )

k2

h n 2.

(3.13)

here h denotes the hyperplane class of m k
n and cn 2 is the (n  2)-th chern class.
the symbol |h n means to take the coecient of the h n term. integrating cn 2 over the
manifold and using rm k

h n 2 = k we recover the lg prediction (3.12).

n

we may rewrite the above euler number  as
(1  k)n + k  1

 =

k

+ n  1

(3.14)

in (3.14) we recognize the 2nd term as the number of elements in the kahler subring and
then the rst term is identied as the number of primitive elements of m k
n . on the other
hand, in the lg description the rst term is identied as the sum of contributions from the
untwisted sectors a = 0, b = 0, , k1 while the 2nd term equals the sum of contributions
from the twisted sectors and the massive vacua. thus we nd the correspondence

untwisted sector  primitive classes,
twisted sector+massive vacua  kahler subring.

(3.15)

(3.16)

we recognize that the quantum deformation takes place only in the sector of kahler
subring and the primitive classes remain intact under quantum deformation.

hirzebruch signature

let us now consider the hirzebruch signature  and its elliptic generalization. first
we recall that the signature is well-dened only for 4n real dimensional manifolds. thus
we take n =even hereafter.

in the lg formulation the elliptic genus for the signature is given by (3.5) with  = 1/2,

we assume that there is no contribution to the signature from the massive vacua.

first we study the modular property of (3.17) and determine the possible choice of
phase factors na,b. it is known that the elliptic genus is a modular form under the group
0(2) which leaves invariant a xed spin structure. 0(2) is the subgroup of sl(2, z) of
index 6 and consists of matrices of the form

0(2) = (  a b

c d ! =   1 0

0 1 ! , mod 2) .

(3.19)

it is generated by the elements t 2, st 2s1 where s and t are the standard generators
of sl(2, z)

s =   0 1

0 ! , t =  1 1

0 1 ! .

here we also have adjusted the overall sign so that (3.30) agrees with the standard con-
vention for the signature.

let us rst test (3.30) by comparing its ground state multiplicity with the classical
value of the signature. in the case of n = 4 (complex surface), for instance, it is easy to
compute geometrically the signature of m k

(3.32)

where the rst sum comes from the untwisted sector and the second from the twisted

add up to +1 when k =even. we may rewrite the rst sum as

(3.33)

(3.33) is an alternating sum of coecients of integer powers of t. in the case of n = 4, for
instance, after a simple calculation we nd that (3.33) is equal to

lg = ,

k = even

(3.34)

(3.35)

while lg =   1, k = odd. therefore the prediction of the lg theory agrees with the
geometry only when k =even. when k =odd, there is a missing factor of 1 in lg.
more precisely we may identify the above coecients in (3.33) as the the hodge num-

bers. in the case of n = 4

(3.36)

here a factor 1 is subtracted from h1,1 in order to eliminate the contribution from the
kahler class. in the case k =even this factor 1 together with an additional factor 1 from
the twisted sectors adds up to 2 and one obtains

lg = 2 + 2h2,0  h1,1

(3.37)

in agreement with the index theorem. in the case k =odd, however, twisted sectors cancel
and lg theory fails to reproduce (3.37). one can check that this phenomenon occurs for
all values of n .

we may further test the agreement of the lg theory with the geometry at excited
levels, in particular in the case of k =even. unfortunately, it is not easy to evaluate the
expression (3.30) exactly except for the trivial case k = 1 where ( ) vanishes identically,

k = 1 :

( ) = 0,

any n.

(3.38)

in the case k =even, however, we may repeatedly use the addition formula of the
 function and evaluate (3.30) in a closed form. details are described in the appendix.
computation in the case k = 2 is straightforward and is given by

we nd that the formulas for k = 2, 4, 6 all agree with the geometrical data presented in
the next section.

on the other hand in the case of odd k we can not evaluate (3.30) in a closed form

but only obtain its q-expansion. we list the formulas for k = 3 and 5

(3.42)

(3.43)

by comparing these results with the geometrical data we conclude that the lg predic-
tions reproduce the elliptic genus for signature exactly if and only if k = even. we note
that the hypersurface m k
n with n =even is a spin manifold when k =even and hence we
nd the agreement of lg theory with geometry when the target space is a spin manifold.
condition of spin manifold seems natural since the signature is closely related to the
a genus which exists only for the spin manifold. in the case of calabi-yau manifolds the
elliptic genera for  and a are in fact given by the same modular function evaluated at
dierent values of its argument.

we note that in the previous section euler number of the manifold was correctly
computed using lg theory without any condition for n and k. in section 5 we nd that
the elliptic genus for a (which exists only for n =even and k =even) can also be correctly
reproduced by lg theory. thus lg theory works at

lg works for any n , k
 (exists for any n and k)
lg works for n =even and k =even
 (exists for n =even)
a (exists for n =even and k =even) lg works for n =even and k =even.

(3.44)

geometrical computation

let us now turn to the geometrical evaluation of the elliptic genus in order to provide data
to test lg predictions. outline of calculation goes as follows.

elliptic genus for the loop-space signature operator on a manifold m of complex di-

mension d is dened as [14, 15]

where ch(eq) is the chern character for a bundle eq

eq = (n1(qnt m ))  (n1(qnt m ))  (n1sqn(t m  t m )).

(4.46)

here qn(t m ) means, for instance, 1 + qnt m + q2n(t m )2 +  and s() stands for
the (anti-)symmetrization of tensor product of tangent bundles t m . t m is the dual of

a genus

now let us turn to the discussion of the a genus. a is dened for real 4n dimensional spin
manifolds and hence we consider hypersurfaces with even n and k. in the lg formulation
the elliptic genus for a is dened by

basically 2 in  is replaced by 3 in  a. the sign (1)a+b is xed again by the consid-
eration of modular invariance.

a(lm ) = q d

6 discussions

n in the complex projective space cpn 1. m k

in this article we have discussed a possible generalization of calabi-yau/landau-ginzburg
correspondence to a more general class of manifolds. we have considered the case of degree-
k hypersurfaces m k
n has a positive, zero
and negative 1st chern class depending on n > k,n = k and n < k, respectively. in all
these cases we have found that the cft/lg system always predicts the correct topological
invariants when k =even and m k
n s are spin manifolds. this fullls our expectation that
smooth quantum deformation or renormalization ow preserves the topological character-
istics of the manifolds. on the other hand, when k =odd and manifold does not have spin
structure, lg predictions for the signature are in disagreement with the geometry. thus
we have found some evidence that the cft/geometry correspondence may exist in the
case of spin manifolds.

13

in order to test this conjecture we have considered the following example of hypersur-

faces in weighted projective space

m k : x 2k

1 + x 2k

2 + x k

3 + x k

4 = 0.

(6.69)

these surfaces are discussed in the literature [16, 17]. first chern class of m k is given by
3  k and m 3 is a k3 surface. we have studied topological invariants of m k in the case
of k = 1, 3, 5 for which the hypersurfaces have a spin structure and k = 2, 4 which are not
spin manifolds.

we have computed the elliptic genus for the signature and have checked that in the
case of k = 1, 3, 5 the lg prediction for the lower order q-expansion coecients coincide
exactly those of geometry. on the other hand, lg theory disagree with geometry in the
case k = 2, 4. this example gives some additional evidence for our conjecture.

after nishing our computations we have found a brief remark in [3] (section 3) on the
relevance of spin manifolds: there it is pointed out that in the case of non-vanishing rst
chern class u (1)r-symmetry of the theory becomes anomalous and the amplitude (3.10) is
no longer a topological invariant. however, there is a remaining discrete u (1)r-symmetry
zc1 and (3.10) is still well-dened for  = integer/c1. thus if c1 is even and the manifold
has a spin structure, the amplitude is well-dened at  = 1/2 which corresponds to the
hirzebruch signature.

our results are quite consistent with this remark: the lg computation works for any
value of k in the case of euler number ( = 0), however, it works only for k =even in the
case of signature.

it will be interesting to study the geometry/lg correspondence in more general ex-

amples of manifolds than hypersurfaces.

we would like to thank e.witten and c.vafa for their communication on the possible

we nd f (q, 0) = 1/(3(0| )4(0| )). we start from the geometrical formula for the elliptic

e1 denotes one of the zeros of the cubic equation representing the elliptic curve y2 =

we can evaluate the elliptic genus in the case k = 2 by using the above addition formula.
if we want to compute the genus for k = 4, we have to use the addition formula once more
and express p(4z) in terms of p(z). if we represent the resulting expression in terms of
x(z), we have

note that the numerator of the right-hand-side of the addition formula (6.87) is a
polynomial t16(x) of order 16 which is factored into a product of squares of r4(x) and
s4(x). thus each of the roots i and i have a multiplicity 2 in t16(x). on the other
hand, if one substitutes z = 1/8+(b+a )/4, a, b  z into (6.87), the left-hand-side vanishes
(recall the relation p(1/2 + b + a| ) = e1( )). thus we recognize that {x = x(1/8 + (b +
a )/4| ), a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3} are the solutions of the algebraic equation t16(x) = 0. from
the denition (6.82) x(1/8 + (b + a )/4| ) = x(1/8 + (4 b 1 + (4 a) )/4| ) and hence
each of the roots has a multiplicity 2. then by reducing the range of b to b = 0, 1, the
roots {x = x(1/8+(b+a )/4| ), a = 0, 1, 2, 3, b = 0, 1} are in one to one correspondence
with {i, i, i = 1, 2, 3, 4}.

explicitly the zeros of r4(x) = 0 and s4(x) = 0 are given by

( j = 2uv(uv  (u2 + v2)  (u  v)u2 + v2),
j = 2uv(uv + (u2 + v2)  (u + v)u2 + v2),
( j = 2uv(  uv  i(u2  v2)  (u  iv)v2  u2),
j = 2uv(  uv + i(u2  v2)  (u + iv)v2  u2),

j = 1, 2,

thus we nally prove

this establishes the equivalence of lg theory with geometry for the case k = 4.

by substituting (6.93),(6.94) into (6.92) we obtain the results (3.40) of section 3.

remarks

the k = 2 case is easy and we leave this case to the reader. we can prove the k = 6
version of theorem 1 along the same way, using the explicit calculation of the addition
formula for x(6z| ). the case of a-genus can also be proved using the same method. in
general the proof of the equivalence of lg theory with geometry is reduced to the proof
of the analogue of lemma 2 for general even values of k.

in the case of odd k we lose the factorization of the polynomial in the numerator of the
right-hand-side of the addition theorem. this necessarily happens since the polynomial
is degree k2 which is not divisible by 2. then we can not express (lm k
n ) as a residue
integral in the x variable.
