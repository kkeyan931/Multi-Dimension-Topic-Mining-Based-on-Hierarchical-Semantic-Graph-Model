the embedding procedure of batalin, fradkin, and tyutin, which allows to convert a second-
class system into rst-class, is pushed beyond the formal level. we study nonrelativistic as well as
relativistic systems. we explicitly construct, in all cases, the variables of the converted rst-class
theory in terms of those of the corresponding second-class one. moreover, we only conclude about
the equivalence between these two dierent kind of theories after compairing their respective spectra
of excitations.

i. introduction

constrained systems possessing only second-class constraints, also known as second-class systems, are to be quan-
tized by abstracting the basic equal-time commutators (anticommutators) from the corresponding dirac brackets,
the constraints thereby translating into strong operator relations [1]. then, the classical-quantum transition may be
aicted by ambiguities, which recognize as common origin the noncanonical structure of the dirac brackets. this
problem does not arise in connection with rst-class systems, i.e., constrained systems whose constraints are all rst-
class, because in this case one can retain the canonical structure for the equal-time commmutators (anticommutators)
while imposing the constraints as restrictions on the states. thus, it would be desirable to be able of converting any
second-class system into rst-class. this is precisely what the batalin- fradkin-tyutin embedding procedure (bft)
[2] does for us.

however, the gauge invariant quantization procedure described above, which was also proposed by dirac [1], is not
operational in most cases of physical interest. for instance, for non-abelian gauge theories no one has yet succeded
in constructing a vacuum state of nite norm being anhilated by the corresponding gauss law constraint [3]. in fact,
the quantization of non-abelian gauge eld theories is to be performed in a xed gauge, where constraints and gauge
conditions form a set of second-class constraints. again, the equal-time commutators are to be abstracted from the
corresponding dirac brackets1, which bring us back to the problem we were trying to avoid.

we believe that the importance of the bft conversion mechanism rests more on the fact that it provides an ecient
tool to generate a set of quantum mechanically equivalent theories. this paper is dedicated to a detailed study of
this equivalence.

we start, in section 2, by proposing a second-class nonrelativistic system (a toy model) whose quantization via
dirac brackets can be fully carried out and is free of ambiguities. in section 3, the bft embedding procedure is used
to generate the corresponding rst-class counterpart. after verifying the existence of a unitary gauge, we implement
a canonical transformation which enable us to construct all the phase-space variables of the rst-class theory in terms
of those of the second-class one. as we shall see, the rst-class theory can be formulated in terms of gauge invariant
variables only. also, the number of degrees of freedom of the gauge invariant theory is larger than those of the second-
class theory. hence, it becomes non trivial to establish in what sense these two theories are classically and quantum
mechanically equivalent. the outcomes from the stuckelberg embedding mechanism [7], for the same problem, are
discussed in section 4.

the self-dual (sd) model of townsend, pilch and van nieuwenhuizen [8] has recently served as a testing ground
for appplying the bft embedding procedure in the relativistic case [911]. after its conversion into rst-class,
the sd model appears to be quantum mechanically equivalent to the maxwell-chern-simons (mcs) theory [12,13]
when formulated in a coulomb like gauge. in section 5 we generalize the strategy of section 3, based on canonical
transformations, and build up the phase-space variables of the mcs theory, in any arbitrary gauge, in terms of those
of the sd model. then, the sd and the mcs theories will be shown to be rigorously equivalent irrespective of any
gauge election.

the models in the previous sections only contain bosonic variables. in section 6 we present the bft embedding
of the proca-wentzel eld minimally coupled to fermions. as known, this is a second-class theory possessing bosonic
as well as fermionic second-class constraints. this time is a non-linear transformation which enables us to write the
converted rst-class theory solely in terms of gauge invariant elds.

the conclusions are contained in section 7.

we devote this section to study the classical and quantum dynamics of the nonrelativistic model whose lagrangian

is

m (cid:0) qa ab qb   qa gab qb(cid:1) .

here, m is a mass parameter, a runs from 1 to 2, gab is the metric tensor of a two-dimensional euclidean space and
ab is the completely antisymmetric tensor (12 = +1). the rst term in the right-hand side of (2.1) is reminiscent of
the chern-simons structure in three space-time dimensions, while the second is a mass term.

1see, for instance, refs. [46]

the lagrange equations of motion deriving from (2.1),

qa +  ab qb = 0 ,

tell us that the system under analysis is just a two dimensional particle in uniform circular motion, i.e.,

with (constant) angular velocity equal to . clearly, the energy (h (0)) and the angular momentum (m (0)),

are conserved quantities.

we shall denote by pa the momentum canonically conjugate to the coordinate qa. then, within the hamiltonian

framework, the system is characterized by the primary constraints2

while the canonical hamiltonian reads

does not vanishes, the persistence in time of the primary contraints does not give rise to secondary constraints and,
hence, all the constraints are second-class. the usual counting reveals that only one independent degree of freedom
is present in (2.1).

the system can be quantized through the dirac bracket quantization procedure (dbqp) [1]. according to this,
all phase space variables are to be promoted to operators obeying an equal-time commutator algebra which is to be
abstracted from the corresponding dirac bracket algebra. for the model under analysis, one easily nds that3

[qa , qb] =

(2.8a)

(2.8b)

(2.8c)

as for the quantum mechanical hamiltonian it can be read o directly from (2.6), in view of the absence of ordering
ambiguities in the classical-quantum transition.

within the algebra (2.8) the constraints (2.5) hold as strong identities. therefore, we use them to eliminate from

the game q2 and p2. we, also, dene

q  q1 =
p  2 p1 =  m q2 ,

(2.9a)

(2.9b)

as the variables spanning the reduced phase-space () of the system. as required [4,14], they verify the canonical
commutation relation [q, p] = ih. then, from (2.6) follows that the reduced phase-space hamiltonian is

3we shall not distinguish between a quantum operator and its classical counterpart.

which describes an one dimensional harmonic oscillator with mass m and proper frequency . we shall designate by
|n >, n = 0, +1, +2, ..., the eigenstates of h (0), and by en,

en = (n + 1/2) h|| ,

(2.11)

the corresponding eigenvalues.

the expression for the quantum mechanical angular momentum operator can not be obtained by promoting (2.4)
to the quantum regime. indeed, if one insists on m (0) = h (0)/, m (0) fails to anhilate the ground state |n = 0 >.
because of this, we substitute (2.4) by

m (0) =

h (0)

to summarize, m (0) and h (0)ast possess common eigenstates and the eigenvalues of m (0) are mnh with

(2.12)

(2.13)

we shall also need, for future purposes, the functional formulation of the quantum dynamics. the green functions
generating functional (w ) for second-class systems was derived by senjanovic [15]. since in the present case the
determinant det [t (0)

]p is just a number, the expression for w reduces to

where we have used (2.9a). this conrms that the reduced system is an one dimensional harmonic oscillator. the
analysis of the toy model as a second-class system is by now complete.

iii. bft embedding of the toy model

we next use the bft [2] procedure to convert the second-class system described in the previous section into
rst-class4. for this purpose, one starts by introducing an additional pair of canonical variables (coordinate ua and
momentum sa) for each second-class constraint. the new constraints and the new hamiltonian are found, afterwards,
through an iterative scheme which, in the present case, ends after a nite number of steps. presently, the bft
conversion procedure yields

where the following denition

has been introduced. we emphasize that the zas are composite objects whose poissson bracket algebra,

derives from the canonical algebra

(cid:2)za , zb(cid:3)p =  ab ,
(cid:2)ua , ub(cid:3)p = 0 ,

[sa , sb]p = 0 ,
[ua , sb]p = a
b .

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5a)

(3.5b)
(3.5c)

one can easily check that the new constraints and the new hamiltonian are, as required, strong under involution, i.e.,

[ ta , tb ]p = 0 ,
[ ta , h ]p = 0 .

(3.6a)
(3.6b)

the converted system is, indeed, rst-class and obeys an abelian involution algebra.

we construct next the unitarizing hamiltonian (hu ) and the corresponding green functions generating functional

(w) [2]. if we denote by

  ca a  pa a ,

  a p a + ta ca ,

(3.7)

(3.8)

the gauge xing fermion function and the brst charge, respectively, one has that

(3.9)
here, ca and ca are ghost coordinates and pa and p a their respective canonical conjugate momenta. furthermore,
a is the lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint ta and a is its canonical conjugate momentum. the
gauge conditions a are to be chosen such that

hu = h  [  ,  ]p .

the generating functional w, corresponding to the unitarizing hamiltonian (3.9), is

det [ a , tb ]p 6= 0 .

where the unitarizing action au is given by

w = n z [d] exp(iau ) ,

au = z +



dt (cid:16)pa qa + sa ua + a a + ca p a + pa ca  hu(cid:17)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

and the integration measure [d] involves all the variables appearing in au . to complete the characterization of
the converted system, we mention that under an innitesimal supertransformation generated by , the phase space
variables change as follows

 ca  [ ca ,  ]p  = a  ,
 pa  [ pa ,  ]p  = ta  ,
a  [ a ,  ]p  = 0 ,
ca  [ca ,  ]p  = 0 ,
p a  [p a ,  ]p  = 0 ,

we now focus on eq.(3.11) and restrict ourselves to consider gauge conditions which do not depend upon a and/or
a. then, the rescaling a  a/, a   a and ca   ca allows, at the limit   0, to carry out all the integrals
over the ghosts and multiplier variables [16,17], with the result

(3.14)

the structure of the hamiltonian (see eq.(3.2)) suggests the change of variables ua  ua = za, sa  s
whose jacobian is a nonvanishing real number. since h does not depend upon s
straightforward and after performing it one obtains

a = sa,
a, the corresponding integration is

notice that, up to a surface term, 1/2r dtzaab zb can be rewritten in the standard canonical form r dtz1 z2. the

interpretation of z1 as the canonical conjugate momentum of z2, suggested by (3.4), is then possible but not mandatory.
finally, we take advantage of the functions [ta] to carry out the integrals on pa, thus arriving at the following nal
expression for w

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

one can easily verify, from (3.3), (3.13a), (3.13c) and (3.13d), that xa is gauge invariant.

clearly, the subsidiary conditions za  0 enables one to recover the original second-class theory (see (2.14)) and,
therefore, dene the unitary gauge. this is enough to secure that the rst-class theory (3.16) is equivalent to the
second-class theory (2.14) from which we started.

most investigations on the bft embedding procedure end at the level of our expression (3.15). this leave out of
consideration a whole of possibilities whose analysis is one of our purposes in this work. to exemplify what we mean
by this, we perform in (3.14) the canonical transformation

(3.19a)

(3.19b)

(3.19c)

(3.19d)

(3.20)

(3.21)

notice that qa, pa, and sa are gauge invariant phase-space variables, as can be seen from (3.13) and (3.19). moreover,
the canonical transformation (3.19) has been chosen in such a way that the constraints are simply given by the
equations sa = 0. thus, only the coordinates u a are aected by gauge transformations and, furthermore, u a  0 are
admissible gauge conditions, to be selected from now on. hence, after carrying out the s,u and p integrals in (3.21)
one arrives at

(3.22)

(3.23)

only contains gauge invariant degrees of freedom.

observe that the mass term in (2.1) has been replaced by a standard kinetic energy term. then, lu=0 does not
describe a constrained system but a regular one possessing truly two independent degrees of freedom. on the other
hand, l involves, as we already pointed out, only one independent degree of freedom. since the bft conversion
procedure should no alter the physics, lu=0 and l must be equivalent. we shall next investigate this equivalence in
detail.

let us rst look at the classical dynamics arising from lu=0. the lagrange equations of motion are found to read

implying that

qa +  ab qb = 0 ,

qa +  ab qb = c a ,

where c a, a = 1, 2 are constants of motion. the cartesian form of the trajectory is easily found to be

(3.27)

(3.28)

turn out to be conserved quantities. by comparing these results with the corresponding ones in section 2, we conclude
that the second-class rotator was converted into a rst-class system just by turning arbitrary the position of the center
of rotation.

we turn next into quantizing lu=0. for a regular (unconstrained) system the equal-time commutation algebra

must be abstracted from the corresponding poisson bracket algebra. then,

(cid:2) qa , qb(cid:3) = 0 ,

[ qa , pb] = ih a
[ pa , pb] = 0 .

b ,

(3.29a)
(3.29b)
(3.29c)

due to the absence of ordering ambiguities, the hamiltonian operator can be read o from (3.21). on the other hand,
in terms of phase-space variables the angular momentum operator is found to read

m = qa ab pb .

(3.30)

it will prove convenient to introduce destruction (a) and creation (a

(3.38)

(3.39)

the dependence of en+,n on n+ and n is rather peculiar. in fact, for  > 0 the right hand side of eq.(3.38)
reduces to (n+ + 1/2)h||, while for  < 0 it goes into (n + 1/2)h||. hence, in either case, the energy eigenvalue
spectrum is that of the second-class system (see eq.(2.11)). as for the angular momentum, we observe that mn+,n
depends simultaneously on n+ and n, irrespective of the sign of . thus, the energy levels of the rst-class system
are (innitely) degenerate, whereas those of the second-class system are not (see eq.(2.13)). for both systems, the
range of eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator is the same. it is in this sense that these systems are quantum
mechanically equivalent.

before closing this section, we would like to conrm that the degeneracy of the energy levels is related to the
arbitrariness in the position of the point around which the classical motion takes place. to this end, we start by
noticing that the right hand sides in eqs.(3.21) and (3.30) can both be diagonalized by means of the canonical
transformation

(3.41)

(3.42)

the decoupling of the sector , p from the dynamics should be noticed. moreover, from (3.28) and (3.42) follows
that the constants of motion c a, a = 1, 2 can be written in terms of  and p as

c1 =

(3.43a)

(3.43b)

in fact,  and p are, up to proportionality constants, the noether charges associated with the invariance of lu=0
under the global translations qa  qa + c a. as already pictured, what we have at hand is a rotator whose location
in the plane q1 and q2 is arbitrary.
this new formulation of the converted model is to be quantized, again, by abstracting the equal-time commutators

from the corresponding poisson brackets. the only nonvanishing commutators, then, are

9

[  , p ] = ih ,
[  , p ] = ih ,

and, consequently, from (3.41), (3.42) and (3.44) one obtains

[ k , m ] = [ k ,  ] = [ k , p ] = 0 .

(3.44a)
(3.44b)

(3.45)

thus, we have four conserved observables (k, m , , and p) but not all of them are mutually commuting, since

[ m ,  ] =

m
[ m , p ] = 

p 6= 0 ,
ihm

 6= 0 .

2

(3.46a)

(3.46b)

we select k and m as the maximal set of commuting observables. their common eigenstates will be labeled by the
corresponding eigenvalues, en and mn,n, respectively. according to (3.41) the hamiltonian k is that of an harmonic
oscillator of mass m and proper frequency ||. therefore,
en = (cid:18) n +
1

2(cid:19) h|| ,

(3.47)

where n is a positive semidenite integer. this conrms that the energy eigenvalue spectrum is that of the second-class
system (see (2.11)). as for the angular momentum, we observe that the rst term in the right-hand side of (3.42)
is just k whereas the second is, up to a sign, proportional to the hamiltonian operator of an harmonic oscillator of
mass m and proper frequency ||/2. hence,

mn,n = ( n  n ) () ,

(3.48)

where n and n are positive semidenite integers. as it must be the case, this is in agreement with (3.39). it is clear
that the degeneracy of the energy levels en is due to the presence of n in (3.48). in turn, n originates from the
harmonic oscillator in the sector  and p. as we already pointed out, these are the variables that, in the classical
limit (h  0), determine the location of the center of rotation in the plane q1, q2.

iv. st uckelberg embedding of the discrete system

the aim of this section is to compare the outcomes of the bft and the stuckelberg [7] embeddings in connection with
the nonrelativistic system dened by (2.1). the stuckelberg embedding consists in replacing, in (2.1), qa  qa + ya,
thus obtaining

ls =

1
2

m (cid:2)( qa + ya ) ab ( qb + yb )   ( qa + ya ) gab ( qb + yb )(cid:3) .

(4.1)

we shall designate by pa and wa the momenta canonically conjugate to qa and ya, respectively. from the dening
equations for pa and wa follows that the extended system is characterized by the primary second-class constraints

and the canonical hamiltonian

a = wa +

ta = pa  wa  0 ,

hs =

( qa + ya) ( qa + ya) .

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

there are no secondary constraints. from (4.3) follows that the innitesimal gauge transformations generated by
the rst-class constraints leave the lagrangian (4.1)invariant, as must be the case. the second-class constraints can

10

be eliminated by introducing partial dirac brackets (-brackets) with respect to them [1,46]. for the nonvanishing
-brackets one obtains

b ,

[ qa , pb ] = a
[ pa , pb ] = 
1
(cid:2) pa , yb(cid:3) =

[ pa , wb ] =

within the -bracket algebra the second-class constraints hold as strong identities. we now use this fact to eliminate
from the game the variables wa, a = 1, 2. as seen from (4.2) and (4.3), the rst-class constraints in the reduced phase
space can be cast as

we subject, afterwards, the remaining variables to the transformation

all other -brackets vanish. in terms of these new variables, the rst-class constraints and the hamiltonian of the
reduced phase-space are found to read, respectively,

a = pa + ab (cid:18) 1

(4.10)

(4.11)

from (4.1), (4.2), (4.10) and (4.11) one concludes that the bft and the stuckelberg embeddings lead to equivalent
results. the only subtle point to be noticed is that the zs are composite variables, while the zs are basic phase-space
variables. nevertheless, the second-class constraints involving the zs give rise to a dirac bracket which is numerically
equal to the poisson bracket obeyed by the zs.

v. bft embedding of the self-dual model

on a semiclassical level, the sd model has been shown [18,19] to be equivalent to the maxwell-chern-simons (mcs)
theory [12,13,20]. that this equivalence holds on the level of the green functions was proved in ref. [21]. lately, the
second-class constraints of the sd model were successfully converted into rst-class by means of the bft embedding

11

procedure. it was then found that the sd model and the mcs theory in a coulomb like gauge are just dierent
gauge-xed versions of a parent theory [911].

in this section we go further on and construct explicitly, for any gauge, the phase space variables of the mcs theory
in terms of those of the sd model. as we shall see, the strategy developed in sections 2 and 3 will be of great help
for putting the equivalence between the sd and the mcs theories on a more rm basis.

the dynamics of the sd theory is described by the lagrangian density [8,18]

lsd =

(5.1)

where  is a parameter with dimensions of mass. we use natural units (c = h = 1) and our metric is g00 = g11 =
g22 = 1. the fully antisymmetric tensor  is normalized such that 012 = 1 and we dene ij  0ij . repeated
greek indices sum from 0 to 2 while repeated latin indices sum from 1 to 2. within the hamiltonian framework, the
sd model is characterized by the primary constraints [911,21]

we denote by  the momentum canonically conjugate to the eld variable f . all constraints are second-class.

the quantization of the sd model as a second-class theory was carried out in detail in ref. [22]. the heisenberg

equations of motion together with the equal-time commutation relations are solved by

f ()(~k) = (~k) a()(~k) .

(5.5)

(5.6a)

(5.6b)

here, a()(~k) are creation and anhilation operators and (~k) is the polarization vector. observe that the system
under analysis possesses three coordinates, three momenta and four second-class constraints. thus, as in the particle
case in section 2, one is left with only one independent degree of freedom. the determination of (~k) led to [22]

0(~k) =

~k  ~(0),

j(~k) = j(0) +

where

as for the spin of the of the sd quanta, it was found to be 1 depending upon the sign of .

a = pa, whose jacobian
is nonsingular and can be lumped into the normalization constant n . since hsd does not depend upon p

this is the analog of (3.16). the role of the nonrelativistic variables xa (see eq.(3.18)) is now played by the variables

c , dened as

c0 = f 0 + 3 ,
c i = f i + i .

(5.16a)
(5.16b)

the variables c  are gauge invariant. to see this, we recall that the generator of innitesimal gauge transformations
(g) is, by denition [1], a linear combination of the rst-class constraints, i.e.,

where the a are innitesimal gauge parameters and a runs from 0 to 3. then, under innitesimal gauge transformation
the phase space variables can be seen to change as follows

g = z d2x a ta ,

from (5.16) and (5.18) follows that the c s are, as asserted, gauge invariant elds. moreover, the subsidiary
conditions a = a = 0 return us back to the original second-class theory and, hence, dene the unitary gauge.

we turn next into investigating the existence of alternative formulations for the converted theory. guided by the

particle case, we perform the canonical transformation

i = u i = 0 does not imply in a physically meaningful restriction and enables us to carry out the u i and ni
integrals. the situation is quite analogous to that encountered in the particle case. afterwards, the constraint t3 is
exponentiated by means of the auxiliary variable 3 and the integrals on n0 and u 3 are performed. the integrals on
n3 and 3 are also carried out and one arrives at

which is just the phase-space path integral describing the mcs theory in any arbitrary canonical gauge [20]. also,
from eqs.(5.18) and (5.19) one can conrm that, under innitesimal gauge transformations, the eld variables a and

after performing the momentum integrations, one nds that the eective lagrangian arising from (5.27) is the well

known mcs lagrangian density lm cs [12,13,20]
lm cs  lu i=0 = 

1
42 f f  +

f a .

(5.28)

as in the particle case, the mass term in (5.1) was replaced by a kinetic energy term. however, unlike in the
particle case, lm cs can not be fully written in terms of gauge invariant elds. in fact, lm cs does not describe a
regular theory but a rst-class one, possessing two rst-class constraints [20]. the counting of degrees of freedom
(three coordinates, three momenta, two rst-class constraints and two gauge conditions) reveals that, as in the sd
model, only one independent degree of freedom is present in the mcs theory. since lm cs derives from lsd through
the bft conversion procedure, they must be equivalent. in fact, as demonstrated in ref. [22], the particle content of
the sd model is that of the mcs model in the coulomb gauge, while the polarization vector of the sd quanta (see
eqs.(5.7) and (5.8)) is that of the massive mcs quanta in the landau gauge5. it is in this sense that lm cs and lsd
describe equivalent physics.
we believe to have generalized the proof of equivalence between the sd and the mcs models presented in refs.
[911,21], where the election of specic functional forms for 0 and 3 was essential to establish this correspondence.
notice, moreover, that our proof of equivalence is not restricted to demonstrate the equality between two functional
integrals, but also involves an explicit construction of the phase-space variables of the mcs theory in terms of those
of the sd theory. this is precisely the meaning of the canonical transformation in eq.(5.19).

vi. bft embedding of the proca-wentzel theory coupled to fermions

we shall present in this section the bft embedding of the 3 + 1-dimensional proca-wentzel eld (b) minimally
coupled to fermions (, )6. this is second-class theory involving bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom and
exhibiting bosonic and fermionic constraints. our starting point is the lagrangian density

is symmetric. we would like to stress that, as a consequence of the embedding procedure, the number of fermions
doubles7. one can check that the constraints ba, fa, fa and h are strong under involution, thus characterizing an
abelian rst-class theory. by denition, the hermitean generator of innitesimal gauge transformations is

gp w f = z d3x (cid:0)aba + i afa + i faa(cid:1) ,

where a are the gauge xing functions for the bosonic sector of constraints and a and a are the corresponding ones
for the fermionic sector. these subsidiary conditions are to be chosen as to make all the faddeev-popov determinants,
in eq.(6.11), nonvanishing and eld-independent. the integration measure [d] involves all variables appearing in
the action ap w f , which, in turn, reads

with r d3xhp w f = hp w f . the integrations over the fermionic momenta can be carried out at once by using fa = 0

and fa = 0. then, the gauge is partially xed by choosing 0 = b0. this, together with b0 = 0, enables one
to integrate out the sector b0, b
0 . afterwards, the constraint b1 = 0 is exponentiated by means of the lagrange
multiplier b0, which brings back b0 into the game. finally, by restricting the remaining gauge conditions not to
depend upon 0 and the momenta b

i , the corresponding integrals can also be carried out. thus, one arrives at

we end this work by remarking that, as in the particle case, the theory can be fully phrased in terms of local gauge
invariant variables. to see how this come about, we start by introducing the composite elds ,  and b via the

therefore, the theories described by lp w f and lp w f

vii. conclusions

the bft conversion procedure provides a systematics to generate a set of rst-class theories equivalent to a given
second-class one. however, we learnt that no a priori statements can be made about the kind of rst-class theories
arising through the bft mechanism.

indeed, in the particle case we succeded in nding a canonical transformation where all the rst-class constraints
ta became a subset sa of the transformed momenta. then, only the variables u a, canonically conjugate to sa, were
aected by the gauge transformations. moreover, it turned out possible to write the hamiltonian k in terms gauge
independent variables only. qa, and pa.

the situation for the sd model was qualitatively dierent. as indicated in eq.(5.24), only the converted primary
constraints t0 and ti turned, after the canonical transformation, into momenta. the converted secondary constraint
t3 remains a combination of the phase-space variables ai and pi (see eq.(5.24c)). as consequence, the coordinates
of the mcs theory are gauge dependent objects.
any attempt of relating the results summarized above with the existence or not of secondary second-class constraints
was destroyed by the proca-wentzel theory. there, the presence of secondary second-class constraint was not enough
to prevent us of writing the converted rst-class theory only in terms of gauge invariant elds.

it has recently appeared in the literature the bft embeddings of the massive yang-mills theory [26] and of the
non-abelian sd model [27]. the generalization for these cases of our technique mounted on canonical transformations
is currently under progress.
