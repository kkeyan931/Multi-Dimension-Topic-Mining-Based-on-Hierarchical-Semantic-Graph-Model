abstract

it has been conjectured that little string theories in six dimensions are
holographic to critical string theory in a linear dilaton background. we
test this conjecture for theories arising on the worldvolume of heterotic
vebranes. we compute the spectrum of chiral primaries in these the-
ories and compare with results following from type i-heterotic duality
and the ads/cft correspondence. we also construct holographic duals
for heterotic vebranes near orbifold singularities. finally we nd several
new little string theories which have spin(32)/z2 or e8  e8 global
symmetry but do not have a simple interpretation either in heterotic or
m-theory.

i. introduction

one of the surprises of the second string revolution was the discovery of nontrivial

poincare-invariant quantum theories in six dimensions [18]. some of these theories are

superconformal quantum eld theories with (2, 0) or (1, 0) supersymmetry. others, dubbed

little string theories (lsts), are not scale-invariant and do not have a stress-energy ten-

sor or other local operators. they may have (2, 0), (1, 1), or (1, 0) supersymmetry. at

length-scales much larger than the nonlocality scale they ow either to free super yang-

mills theories, or to one of the nontrivial superconformal eld theories mentioned above.

one way to construct lsts is to consider at parallel neveu-schwarz vebranes in type

ii or heterotic string theory and take the limit of zero string coupling. the theory on the

branes remains interacting in this limit and denes an lst. another way is to consider type
ii or type i string theory on an orbifold of the form r4/ for some nite group   su(2).
in the limit of zero string coupling the theory of twisted modes denes an lst. finally, one

may combine the two methods.

using these methods the following classes of lsts have been constructed:

(iia) (1, 1) lsts obtained from iia on ade singularities [8];

(iib) (2, 0) lsts obtained from iib on ade singularities [8];

(o) (1, 0) lsts obtained from spin(32)/z2 heterotic vebranes in at space [8];

(e) (1, 0) lsts obtained from e8  e8 heterotic vebranes in at space [8];
(ii) (1, 0) lsts obtained from iia or iib vebranes at ade singularities [9];

(o) (1, 0) lsts obtained from spin(32)/z2 heterotic vebranes at ade singularities [9];
(e) (1, 0) lsts obtained from e8  e8 heterotic vebranes at ade singularities [9].
these classes of lsts are manifestly inequivalent as they have dierent supersymmetries

and/or global symmetries. some of these theories have alternative realizations; for example

the lst obtained from iia (iib) string theory on an an 1 singularity is equivalent to the

lst of n iib (iia) vebranes. several other (1, 1) lsts have been constructed in ref. [10].

they can be regarded as excitations of lsts of type (iia) [8].

2

above we dened lsts by considering the decoupling limit of critical string theories.

one can give a more intrinsic denition using discrete light cone quantization [6,1113].

finding a poincare-invariant intrinsic denition of lsts is an important open problem.

in ref. [14] it was conjectured that lsts have a dual description in terms of critical string

theory in linear dilaton backgrounds. this conjecture is similar in spirit to the ads/cft

correspondence [15] which posits that certain conformally-invariant quantum eld theories

in d dimensions are dual to critical string theory or m-theory on backgrounds of the form

adsd+1  x for some einstein manifold x. just as in the case of the ads/cft correspon-
dence, stringy excitations are conjectured to be in one-to-one correspondence with operators

in the boundary theory, and their s-matrix is the generating functional for the boundary

correlators. the ads/cft correspondence becomes eective in the large-n limit, where

string/m-theory reduces to supergravity. in contrast, the holographic conjecture of ref. [14]

provides a framework in which the spectrum of operators in the boundary theory can be cal-

culated for any n, but in general correlators cannot be computed. this is because the linear

dilaton background by denition includes a strong coupling region where string perturbation

theory fails. in some cases the strong-coupling singularity is resolved via m-theory, in which

case one can compute the correlators for large n [14,16].

for theories of type (iia) and (iib) the relevant linear dilaton background is the familiar

throat cft describing the near-horizon physics of type ii vebranes. the bosonic elds

of this cft consist of six free bosons describing coordinates parallel to the worldvolume of

the branes, a boson describing the radial transverse coordinate, and an su(2) wess-zumino-

witten (wzw) model describing the angular transverse coordinates. the holographic point

of view reduces the classication problem for (1, 1) and (2, 0) lsts to the classication of

modular invariant partition functions for the wzw part of the cft. it has been argued

in refs. [14,17] that lsts obtained from type ii on ade singularities correspond to ade

modular invariants of su(2) wzw models [18]. thus it appears that (iia) and (iib) theories

represent a complete list of lsts with sixteen supercharges. furthermore, it has been

checked in ref. [14] that the spectrum of worldsheet vertex operators in short representations

3

of the space-time susy algebra includes all the expected moduli of the boundary lst. this

supports the holographic conjecture.

in this paper we study heterotic (1, 0) lsts using the holographic approach of ref. [14]

(see also [19] for related work). in section ii we construct the holographic description of

heterotic vebranes in at space (lsts of types (o) and (e)). we compute the spectrum of

chiral primaries of the space-time supersymmetry algebra and compare with results known

from the ads/cft correspondence and heterotic-type i duality. our analysis provides

evidence that a single heterotic vebrane has a nontrivial decoupling limit, unlike a single

vebrane in type ii. we nd that all known operators of the heterotic lsts (namely the

moduli and their superpartners) have worldsheet counterparts.

lsts of types (o) and (e) have global su(2)l  su(2)r  g symmetry, where g =
spin(32)/z2 or e8  e8, respectively. the su(2)r factor is the r-symmetry. in section iii
we discuss more general (1, 0) lsts with this symmetry. for either choice of g the theories

we construct are in one-to-one correspondence with ane dynkin diagrams of types a,d,

or e, with theories of types (o) and (e) being the a-series. as for type ii theories, the ade

scheme arises from the ade classication of su(2) wzw modular invariants. the d-series

can be obtained by considering heterotic vebranes at an a1 singularity, i.e. they are a

special class of theories of types (o) and (e). the exceptional e-series are a new type of

lsts which do not have a large n limit.1 since the spectrum of chiral operators in the d

and e theories is rather complex, we only discuss a few interesting examples, leaving a full

investigation for the future.

in general, (1, 0) heterotic lsts need to have only su(2)r global symmetry. exam-

ples of such theories can be obtained by orbifolding ade heterotic lsts by a nite group

1we would like to emphasize that the ade lsts we are discussing here are not related to lsts

describing heterotic vebranes near ade orbifold singularities. the latter theories have smaller

global symmetry groups.

4

  su(2)l  g. in section iv we consider zn orbifolds of the a-series which describe het-
erotic vebranes at an1 singularities. (the holographic description of type ii vebranes at

an1 singularities was discussed in ref. [20].) we derive the constraints following from the

modular invariance of the worldsheet. interestingly one can construct a consistent world-

sheet description of an orbifold with an arbitrary embedding of the spin connection into

the gauge connection. this means that the holographic description exists for an arbitrary

lst of types (o) and (e). in contrast, for toroidal heterotic orbifolds (without vebranes)

modular invariance constrains the embedding in such a way as to ensure that the vebrane

charge of each orbifold plane vanishes. section v contains our conclusions.

ii. holographic description of heterotic fivebranes in flat

space

a. supergravity solutions

the solution of the low-energy eective theory describing several coincident heterotic

vebranes (the symmetric vebrane) was constructed in ref. [21]. this solution is very

similar to the one describing type ii vebranes [22], but there are some slight dierences in

the interpretation of parameters, as argued below.

the symmetric vebrane solution has the form

2y

y2(y2 + 2

n )

,

n
y2 ,
,





n

a = 2
e2 = e20 +

h = 
ds2 = abdxadxb + e2dydy.

(2.1)

the notation here is as follows. the latin indices from the beginning of the alphabet run

from 0 to 5 and are raised and lowered with minkowski metric ab, the greek indices run

from 0 to 3 and are raised and lowered with euclidean metric , y2 means yy, 2

n =

5

n exp(20), and  is the anti-self-dual thooft tensor taking values in the lie algebra of
su(2). it is understood that the su(2) is minimally embedded into spin(32)/z2 or e8e8,
i.e.
it is identied with one of the su(2) groups in the (spin(28)  su(2)  su(2))/z2
subgroup of spin(32)/z2 or with the su(2) group in the e8  (e7  su(2))/z2 subgroup
of e8  e8.

the vebrane charge of the solution eq. (2.1) (dened as the integral of h over an s3
y2 = r2, r  ) is equal to n. intuitively, eq. (2.1) describes a single su(2) instanton
of size n superimposed with n  1 small instantons (vebranes) located at y = 0. this
statement requires some qualications. since dh = 0, the integral of h over y2 = r2 is

independent of r and equal to n. this means that if we dene the number of vebranes
at y = 0 as the integral of h over a small s3 surrounding y = 0, we get n, and not n  1.
however, this denition of the vebrane charge is not unique. note that h satises a bianchi

identity of the form

dh = tr r()  r()  tr f  f,

(2.2)

where  diers from the levi-civita connection  by a torsion term, ab

  h ab
 .
one can dene a new eld strength h0 which is a nonlinear function of h and  and satises

 = ab

the more usual form of the bianchi identity

dh0 = tr r()  r()  tr f  f.

(2.3)

using h0 instead of h we get a dierent (gauge-invariant) denition of the vebrane charge.

for the symmetric vebrane solution the new vebrane charge measured at innity is still
n, while the vebrane charge measured on a small s3 surrounding y = 0 is n  1. given
this nonuniqueness of the vebrane charge, we prefer to x the precise relation between

n and the number of vebrane at the origin n5 by matching symmetries and operators

of the worldsheet cft and the boundary lst. we will see below that this leads to the

identication n = n5 + 1.2

2note that in the type ii case the relation between n and n5 is simply n = n5.

6

we are interested in the decoupling limit 0   when the asymptotic string coupling
goes to zero. if we introduce the radial coordinate t = log y2 and rescale xa  xa(n)1/2,

the limiting solution takes the form

2y
y2 ,

a =  
 = t,
h = n,
3(cid:17) ,
ds2 = n(cid:16)abdxadxb + dt2 + ds2

(2.4)

where ds2
3 is the standard round metric on the hypersurface y2 = 1 and  is its volume
form. note that the transverse coordinates y now parametrize a copy of s3  r with n
units of h-ux on s3. the size of the single instanton goes to innity in the decoupling
limit, and the gauge eld a becomes a at connection on s3  r. since s3  r is simply
connected, a can be gauged away. a priori, one could expect this supergravity background
to solve the stringy equations of motion only if the dilaton gradient is small ( 1/2),
which requires n  1. however, it is well known that eq. (2.4) corresponds to a soluble
worldsheet cft [21] and therefore is an exact solution for all n.

it has been proposed in ref. [14] that string theory in a background of the form

ds2 = (cid:16)abdxadxb + dt2 + gijdyidyj(cid:17) ,
 = 

qt
2

(2.5)

where ab is the minkowski metric on rd1,1, is equivalent to a quantum theory without

gravity on rd1,1. this equivalence is holographic in the sense that the latter theory lives

at t =  and its correlators can be computed from the s-matrix of string excitations
in particular, global symmetries of the boundary theory
in the background eq. (2.5).

correspond to gauge symmetries of the bulk theory. of course, in order to compute the

s-matrix string perturbation theory is not sucient, as the excitations propagating towards

t =  inevitably reach the region of strong coupling. but in order to compute the spectrum
of excitations it is sucient to analyze the theory near the perturbative region t = +.

7

(this analysis can miss some purely nonperturbative states [14]. we will see examples of

this below.)

following the proposal of ref. [14], we conjecture that the heterotic string background

eq. (2.4) is holographic to the worldvolume theory of heterotic vebranes located at t = .
the parameter n is related to the number of vebranes n5 living at t =  via n = n5 +1.

b. worldsheet partition function

the worldsheet cft corresponding to the heterotic background eq. (2.4) has been

worked out in ref. [21]. the bosonic elds are six free bosons x a, a = 0, . . . , 5, an su(2)

wzw model at level k = n, and a feigin-fuchs eld t with real background charge q2/n.

the level of the wzw model is simply the ux of the h-eld through s3. the fermionic

elds are ten right-moving fermions and 32 left-moving fermions. not all fermions are free:

four of the left-movers and four of the right-movers are coupled to certain (unequal) pure

gauge connections. performing the gauge rotation, it possible to make the fermions free.

this rotation is anomalous and shifts the level of the wzw from k = n to k = n  2.
thus we end up with ten free right-moving fermions and 32 free left-moving fermions. the

dierence between g = spin(32)/z2 and g = e8  e8 is encoded in the boundary condi-
tions for the left-moving fermions. it is convenient to bosonize the left-movers into sixteen

free bosons h,  = 1, . . . , 16 living on the weight lattice of g.

the (4, 0) worldsheet superalgebra combines six of the right-moving fermions a with

x a, and the remaining right-moving fermions  with t and the wzw eld g(z, z). the

gauged worldsheet supercurrent is right-moving and has the form

g(z) = abax b + 0 +s 2

n hj i

w zw i + 123  0i .

(2.6)

here and in what follows the latin indices from the middle of the alphabet i, j, . . . run from

1 to 3. the partition function of this cft on a torus is

8

z(,  ) =

1
2

(im  )2( )20 ( )8(cid:16)3(q)4  4(q)4  2(q)4)(cid:17) z(,  )zw zw (,  )g( ).

(2.7)

here z and zw zw are the partition functions of the feigin-fuchs eld and the su(2) wzw

model, respectively, and g is the theta-function of the (even, self-dual) weight lattice of

g. it is easy to check that z(,  ) is modular-invariant provided zw zw (,  ) is a modular-

invariant combination of ane su(2) characters.

a celebrated theorem [18] states that such modular-invariant combinations have an ade

classication. only the a-type modular invariant exists for all levels k, and thus it is

very plausible that it corresponds to heterotic vebranes in at space. we will discuss the

interpretation of d and e invariants in the next section.

c. symmetries of the worldsheet cft

let us now discuss the symmetries of the worldsheet cft and the corresponding lsts.

the internal cft has (4, 0) worldsheet supersymmetry. this implies [23] that the space-time

theory has (1, 0) supersymmetry in six dimensions. the corresponding su(2) r-current is

right-moving and has the form

j i
r(z) = j i

w zw (z) +

1
2

ijkjk,

i = 1, 2, 3.

(2.8)

its level is k + 2.3 the supercharges transform in the (4, 2) of spin(1, 5)  su(2)r, where
spin(1, 5) is the six-dimensional lorenz group. there is also a left-moving su(2)l current

jw zw (z) with level k and a left-moving g current jg(z) with level 1 obtained from the h

using the frenkel-kac-segal construction. the supercharges are inert under su(2)l  g.
the construction of the supercharges is standard [23]. bosonizing right-moving fermions

a and  we can construct spin operators s and a, where  is the index of the 4

3the right-moving current jw zw (z) is not brst-invariant.

9

representation of spin(1, 5) and a is the index of the 2 representation of su(2)r. let  be

the bosonized superconformal ghost. in the 1/2 picture the supercurrent is given by

qa(z) = e(z)/2s(z)a(z).

(2.9)

the gso projection is imposed by requiring that physical vertex operators be local with

respect to qa(z).

by the usual holographic logic, the boundary lst must have (1, 0) susy and su(2)l
su(2)rg global symmetry. the su(2)r symmetry is the r-symmetry of the (1, 0) theory.
this is the expected result for a theory of heterotic vebranes in at space. the symmetry

so(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r corresponds to the rotations of the directions transverse to the
vebranes.

the case k = 0 is somewhat special in that the wzw part is absent. thus the su(2)l

symmetry acts trivially in this case. this fact together with type i-heterotic duality pro-

vides a check on our identication k = n  2 = n5  1. for g = spin(32)/z2 we can
think of n5 heterotic vebranes as n5 type i d5 branes. (the type i description is not

suitable for discussing the decoupling limit, but it is good enough to identify symmetries

and at directions.) the worldvolume theory of n5 d5 vebrane reduces at low energies

to super yang-mills theory with gauge group sp(n5), 32 hypermultiplets in the fundamen-

tal representation, and a hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric tensor representation. the

antisymmetric tensor is a doublet of su(2)l, while the rest of the elds are singlets. for

n5 = 1 the antisymmetric tensor is decoupled from the rest of the theory (it describes the

center-of-mass motion of the d5 brane), and su(2)l acts trivially on the low-energy degrees

of freedom. according to our identication, precisely at this value of n5, the su(2)l action

on the worldsheet becomes trivial, so apparently su(2)l acts trivially on the full lst, and

not just on the low-energy degrees of freedom.

10

d. the spectrum of space-time chiral primaries

the holographic worldsheet description of heterotic lsts found above can be used to

compute the spectrum of operators in chiral multiplets of the space-time susy algebra. for

g = spin(32)/z2 we will compare our results to the spectrum of chiral operators in the

super yang-mills theory living on type i d5 branes. for g = e8  e8 we will compare to
the results obtained using the ads/cft correspondence [15,24,25].

the space-time chiral operators look very much like in the type ii lsts [14]. for

simplicity, we will limit ourselves to space-time scalars. consider the following ansatz for

the internal part of the neveu-schwarz vertex operators (in the 1 picture):

vjl,jr(z, z)  e(z)wjl(z)i(z)vjr(z)e(z,z).

(2.10)

here vjr(z) is a primary of the right-moving bosonic su(2) current algebra with su(2)

spin jr, and wjl(z) is a primary of the left-moving virasoro algebra with su(2)l spin jl.

we need to require that this operator be a primary of the gauged supercurrent g(z). one

can show that this condition is met if the su(2)r indices of the fermion i and of vjr are

contracted to form the representation 2jr + 3 or 2jr  1. in order for vjl,jr to be a vertex
operator for a physical state, it must have dimension (1, 1). this is achieved by setting

 = jrq2/n and taking wjl(z) to be a virasoro primary of dimension

hl = 1 +

.

(2.11)

jr(jr + 1)

n

it is easy to check that vjl,jr is local with respect to qa. moreover, one can check that

it is space-time chiral, i.e. acting on it with a space-time supercharge does not produce

operators with higher su(2)r spin. moreover, out of the two physical contractions of

su(2)r indices of i and vjr only the one with su(2)r spin jr + 1 is a primary (the other

one is its descendant). consequently, for any jl and any acceptable wjl(z) we get precisely

one chiral primary of the space-time susy algebra.

the an 1 modular invariant at level k = n  2 contains ane su(2)k primaries of the
form (2j + 1, 2j + 1) with 2j = 0, 1, . . . , n  2. then eq. (2.11) suggests a natural way

11

to get a suitable wjl: one has to take a left-moving primary vjr(z) and get its level-one

descendant with respect to the left-moving current algebra. the full left-moving current

algebra is su(2)l  r  g, where the r-current is .

if wjl is the descendant with respect to the g current algebra, then jl = jr and wjl

is automatically a virasoro primary.

in this case the operator eq. (2.10) transforms as

(2j + 1, 2j + 3) of su(2)l  su(2)r and is in the adjoint of g.

if w is a descendant with respect to the su(2)l  r current algebra, then depending
on how su(2)l indices are contracted we get one operator with jl = jr + 1, one with

jl = jr  1, and two with jl = jr. the rst two are automatically physical (i.e.
left-moving part is a virasoro primary). one linear combination of the other two is also

the

physical. thus we get three physical operators, (2jr + 3, 2jr + 3), (2jr + 1, 2jr + 3), and

(2jr  1, 2jr + 3). all are singlets with respect to g.

to summarize, the theory has g-singlet chiral primaries of the form (2j + 3  2n, 2j + 3)
with 2j = 0, 1, . . . , n  2, n = 0, 1, 2, and chiral primaries in the adjoint of g of the form
(2j + 1, 2j + 3) with 2j = 0, . . . , n  2. note that (2j + 3, 2j + 3) is a traceless symmetric
tensor of so(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r with 2j + 2 indices. these operators are in one-to-one
correspondence with casimirs of su(n).

comparison with type i d5 branes

let us now compare these operators to the chiral operators of the super yang-mills

theory on k + 1 = n  1 = n5 type i d5 branes (for g = spin(32)/z2). the vebrane
gauge group is sp(k + 1), and the hypermultiplet content is given by

q  (1, 2, 32, 2k + 2),
of su(2)l  su(2)r  spin(32)/z2  sp(k + 1).

y  (2, 2, 1, (k + 1)(2k + 1)  1)

(2.12)

y is the antisymmetric traceless tensor of sp(k + 1).

let us begin with the case k = 0. in this case the only gauge-invariant chiral primary

operator is qq where the su(2)r indices are symmetrized and spin(32)/z2 indices are anti-

12

symmetrized. this operator transforms as 3 of su(2)r and as the adjoint of spin(32)/z2.4

this agrees precisely with what we found from the worldsheet. to see this note that for

k = 0 the left-moving su(2)l current is absent, and most of the worldsheet operators listed

above are absent too.

for k > 0 the yang-mills theory has chiral primary operators in the adjoint of
spin(32)/z2 of the form qy pq, p = 0, . . . , k. they transform as (p + 1, p + 3) of su(2)l 
su(2)r and match precisely all the operators in the adjoint of spin(32)/z2 that we found

on the worldsheet. the yang-mills spectrum also includes singlets of spin(32)/z2 of the
form tr y p+2, p = 0, . . . , k 1 which transform as (p + 3, p + 3) of su(2)l su(2)r. they
also have worldsheet counterparts. however, there are other operators in the lst which

do not have counterparts in yang-mills theory. firstly, there are singlets of spin(32)/z2

with unequal su(2)l and su(2)r spins. secondly, there is a spin(32)/z2-singlet which

transforms as (k + 3, k + 3) of su(2)l  su(2)r.

the latter operator is interesting. it has the same worldsheet origin as the operators
which match tr y p+2, p = 0, . . . , k  1 and its quantum numbers are the same as those of
tr y p+2 for p = k. why is this operator absent in the super yang-mills spectrum? we see

three possible explanations for this.

1.

in general the operators of the low-energy yang-mills theory are a subset of the

operators of the lst. thus it is not surprising that there is no one-to-one match between

them.

in fact, examples of this sort already appear for lsts with sixteen supercharges

studied in ref. [14]. if this interpretation is correct, then (k + 3, k + 3) does not correspond

to a at direction of the lst, unlike (p + 3, p + 3), p = 0, . . . , k  1. unfortunately we do
not know how to check this using worldsheet methods.

2. recall that strictly speaking the symmetric vebrane solution describes k+2 vebranes

4incidentally,

this operator is the lowest component of a supermultiplet containing the

spin(32)/z2 global current.

13

with one vebrane blown up to a nite size n . n goes to innity in the decoupling limit,

which means that we are innitely far along the higgs branch in the direction where the

gauge group sp(k + 2) is broken down to sp(k + 1). the eective low-energy yang-mills

theory includes all the elds of the sp(k +1) system plus a decoupled singlet which describes

the relative position of the k+1 small vebranes and the remaining large vebrane. we could

incorporate this by working with a eld y which is an antisymmetric tensor of sp(k + 2), in

which case the independent operators are tr y p+2, p = 0, . . . , k. naively, we would expect

these operators to be expressible as polynomials in tr y p and the decoupled singlet. the

fact that this factorization does not occur on the worldsheet can be interpreted as the failure

of decoupling in the full lst. if this is correct, then the lst we are studying is not the

same as the lst of k + 1 vebranes at the origin of their moduli space.

3. the holographic conjecture is wrong.

in our view, the third possibility is unlikely. to decide between the rst two possibilities

one has to establish whether there is a at directions along which (k + 3, k + 3) has a

vacuum expectation value.

comparison with ads/cft

if we take g = e8  e8, then the corresponding lst is believed to ow in the infrared
to an interacting (1, 0) superconformal eld theory. its large n limit is described by su-
pergravity on ads7  s4/z2 [24]. to describe the z2 action it is best to think of s4 as a
5 = 1 in r5; then z2 acts by x5  x5 and by ipping
hypersurface x2
the sign of the m-theory 3-form. the xed set of the z2 action is an s3  s4. kaluza-
klein excitations on ads7 are believed to be in one-to-one correspondence with operators

4 + x2

3 + x2

1 + x2

2 + x2

of the large n (1, 0) eld theory on the boundary of ads7. the spectrum of kaluza-klein

excitations has been computed in [25]. to make a meaningful comparison, it is useful to

keep in mind that although every chiral primary of the superconformal algebra at large n

is expected to correspond to a chiral operator in the lst, the converse is not necessarily

true. some chiral operators in the lst may acquire large (i.e. divergent in the large n

limit) dimensions as one ows to the infrared and will not be present in the kaluza-klein

14

spectrum.

one can easily see that all chiral primaries charged under e8  e8 found in ref. [25] are
reproduced by our worldsheet computation. the traceless symmetric tensors of so(4) 
su(2)l  su(2)r with orders 2, 3, . . . also appear in the large n analysis. of course, the
truncation of the spectrum at order n cannot be seen at the level of supergravity. however,

most chiral primaries found in ref. [25] (those which contain odd place-holder elds; see

ref. [25] for details) do not seem to have a worldsheet counterpart. after a little thought,

this may not be so surprising. the existence of operators with odd place-holders is due to the

presence of the hidden eleventh dimension in the e8 e8 heterotic string at strong coupling.
one cannot expect to see this hidden dimension by doing a worldsheet cft computation. in

particular, all operators which are self-dual 3-forms are missed in the worldsheet approach.

similar phenomena are observed in (2, 0) lsts [14]. in the type ii case, however, it may

be possible to nd the missing states by considering d0-branes of the throat cft [14]. this

has no analogue in the heterotic case, since the heterotic d0-charge (the momentum along

the eleventh dimensions) is not conserved.

similarly, for g = spin(32)/z2 we do not see any evidence for sp(k +1) gauge symmetry

in our worldsheet approach, because the gauge group arises through nonperturbative eects

(see also [19]). the spectrum of chiral operators is nevertheless consistent with heterotic-

type i duality, as discussed above.

iii. more general heterotic lsts with su (2)l  su (2)r  g

symmetry

a. worldsheet partition functions

in the previous section we discussed the worldsheet description of heterotic vebranes for

which the partition function of the wzw model was of the a-type. however, we can replace

the wzw partition function in eq. (2.7) by any other modular invariant wzw partition

15

function. such partition functions have an ade classication [18], so we can replace the

a-type partition function in eq. (2.7) by a partition function of d- or e-type. the total

partition function will then be modular invariant and we obtain additional models with

su(2)l  su(2)r  g global symmetry and (4, 0) worldsheet supersymmetry. the a-type
partition functions exist for all levels k, the d-type modular invariants require even k, and

the e-type partition functions, e6, e7, e8, exist for k = 10, 16, 28.

the models with d-type wzw partition functions have a simple space-time interpre-

tation. recall that the d-type modular invariants can be regarded as z2 orbifolds of the

a-type modular invariants at the same level. the z2 in question acts on left-moving su(2)

primaries as the center of su(2). in particular it acts on the group-valued eld g(z, z) of

the wzw model as

g(z, z)  g(z, z)

(3.1)

consequently this orbifolding corresponds to reecting all four coordinates transverse to

the vebranes. thus the d-series describe vebranes at an r4/z2 singularity, i.e.

they

correspond to a particular class of theories of types (o) and (e). note that the z2 orb-

ifold action here does not involve the internal left-moving bosons, which implies that the

gauge connection has a trivial monodromy.5 by virtue of the anomalous bianchi identity

dh = tr r r tr f  f such an orbifold carries nonzero vebrane charge. the usual per-
turbative r4/z2 orbifold, on the other hand, has the spin connection embedded in the gauge

connection in a particular manner so that the vebrane charge cancels between tr r  r
and tr f  f and the group g is broken to a subgroup. we will discuss vebranes near this

5the d-series heterotic cft we are discussing can be obtained from the type ii cft describing

vebranes near an r4/z2(1)fl orbifold [14,20] by embedding the spin connection into the gauge
connection [26]. when applied to the type ii cft describing vebranes near an r4/z2 orbifold,

this procedure yields a slightly dierent heterotic cft discussed at the end of section iv. its

symmetry group coincides with su (2)l  su (2)r  g locally, but not globally.

16

and other orbifolds in the next section.

we still need to determine the precise relation between the number of vebranes n5 and

the wzw level k. analogy with the previous section suggests that k is the total vebrane

charge counted on the cover up to a shift, i.e. k = 2(n5  a) for some constant a. for
g = spin(32)/z2 we can try to determine a by examining the type i dual of our brane

conguration. it consists of n5 type i d5 branes near an r4/z2 singularity, with z2 acting

trivially on the gauge bundle. unlike in the case of type i vebranes in at space, at the

origin of the moduli space the vebrane theory ows to an interacting (1, 0) xed point

[27,28]. this theory has a higgs branch and, for n5  4, also a coulomb branch. the
it cannot be described by a weakly coupled
physics of the higgs branch is exotic, i.e.

eld theory. the physics of the coulomb branch is described by super yang-mills theory

coupled to a tensor multiplet. the yang-mills theory has gauge group sp(n5) sp(n5 4),
16 hypermultiplets q in (2n5, 1), and one hypermultiplet q in (2n5, 2n5  8) [27,28]. the
global symmetry of this theory is su(2)l su(2)r spin(32)/z2, where the lowest compo-
nents of q transform as (1, 2, 32) and the lowest components of q transform as (2, 2, 1). for

n5 = 4 the yang-mills theory reduces to sp(n5) with 16 hypermultiplets in the fundamental

representation, and therefore the su(2)l symmetry acts trivially on the coulomb branch.

in the worldsheet theory su(2)l disappears for k = 0, while for k > 0 the su(2)l symmetry

clearly acts nontrivially. this suggests that k = 2(n5  4). although it is plausible that for
g = e8  e8 the answer is the same, we do not know how to show this.

the theories with e-type wzw partition functions do not have a simple geometric origin.

it is easy to see that they cannot be obtained by orbifolding the heterotic vebrane theory:
any orbifold except the r4/z2 that gives rise to the d-series would break the su(2)l  g
symmetry. on the other hand, the e-series lsts have the full su(2)l  su(2)r  g
symmetry group. this implies that the e-series, unlike the d-series, cannot be obtained as

a geometric orbifold of the a-series. thus the e-series are new heterotic lsts. since they

arise at k = 10, 16, 28, and the level is related to the ux of the h-eld through the 3-sphere

surrounding the vebranes via k = n  2, these theories describe systems of 12, 18, and 30

17

vebranes, respectively. however, it is not possible to think of these vebrane congurations

in terms of low-energy supergravity, since the dilaton gradient (=background charge of the

feigin-fuchs eld) is of order one in string units.

we will not perform an exhaustive analysis of the chiral primary operators of the d

and e models. instead we discuss a few examples in the next subsection. for large k it

should also be possible to study the d-series lsts with g = e8  e8 using the ads/cft
correspondence, but this has not been done yet. the e-series theories exist only for small

values of k, so the worldsheet approach is the only possibility in this case.

b. examples of chiral primaries

the d-series

the modular invariant of type dn/2+1 with n even contains untwisted primaries of

the form (2j + 1, 2j + 1) with 2j = 0, 2, 4, . . . , n  2 and twisted primaries of the form
(n/2 + 2n, n/2  2n) with integer n. the left-right symmetric primaries are the easiest to
analyze, as they behave in the same way as the primaries of the a-series. the untwisted

primaries are all left-right symmetric and produce the same spectrum of chiral operators as

the a-series, except that 2j is restricted to be even. in particular, we obtain chiral primaries

which are traceless symmetric tensors of so(4) of even orders 2, 4, . . . , n. they correspond

to the casimirs of so(n + 2) of the form tr x 2k, k = 1, . . . , n/2. among the twisted

primaries there is a single left-right symmetric one, (n/2, n/2). it yields a chiral primary

operator which is a traceless symmetric tensor of so(4) of order n/2 + 1. its order matches

the order of the pfaan of so(n + 2). it also yields a chiral primary (n/2, n/2 + 2) which

transforms in the adjoint of g.

we will not describe the complete spectrum of chiral operators arising from the left-

right asymmetric wzw primaries.

instead,

let us consider a simple example, that of

(n/2 + 2, n/2  2). in this case the condition eq. (2.11) is satised only if we take wjl(z)
to be the primary of the left-moving bosonic su(2) with spin (n + 2)/4. then we get a

18

space-time chiral primary with su(2)l  su(2)r content (n/2 + 2, n/2).

for g = e8  e8 the theory of n5 heterotic vebranes at an r4/z2 singularity ows
to an interacting (1, 0) xed point [9]. at large n5 this xed point is expected to be
holographic to supergravity on ads4s4/(z2z2), where the two z2s act by x5  x5 and
xi  xi, i = 1, . . . , 4. it would be interesting to study the kaluza-klein spectrum in this
case and compare it to the one found above. an analogy with the type ii case [14] suggests

that chiral operators coming from the pfaan worldsheet primary (n/2, n/2) have a

nonperturbative origin: they are related to an m2-brane wrapped around submanifolds of
s4/(z2  z2). the fact that one of these operators is in the adjoint of e8  e8 suggests that
the corresponding submanifold has boundaries [29].

the e-series

the e-series modular invariants have left-right symmetric primaries with the following

spins:

e6 :

2j = 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10

e7 :

e8 :

2j = 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16

(3.2)

2j = 0, 6, 10, 12, 16, 18, 22, 28

a primary with spin j yields, among others, a chiral operator which is a singlet of g and

transforms with respect to so(4) as a traceless symmetric tensor of order 2j + 2. it is easy

to see that the orders of these tensors match the orders of the casimirs of the respective lie

algebras.

iv. fivebranes near orbifold singularities

in this section we construct heterotic lsts whose global symmetry is a proper subgroup

of su(2)l  su(2)r  g. the simplest way to obtain such theories is to orbifold the ade
lsts discussed above by a nite group   su(2)lg (if one wants to preserve (1, 0) susy,
su(2)r has to be a spectator.) since su(2)l acts on the fundamental wzw eld g(z, z)

19

by left multiplication, one can interpret the orbifolded lsts as representing vebranes near

an r4/ orbifold. however, this interpretation can be taken literally only when the dilaton

gradient in the theory is small, i.e. for large n. in particular, orbifolds of en lsts cannot

be understood in geometric terms. furthermore, for special values of the wzw level the

worldsheet cft has accidental symmetries, in which case  can be chosen to be a subgroup

of this larger symmetry group.6 for example, su(2)4 wzw corresponding to the modular

invariant of type d4 has accidental su(3)1 symmetry [30]. in this paper we limit ourselves

to studying zn orbifolds of the a-series, leaving the investigation of nongeometric and

nonabelian orbifolds for the future.

let  be a generator of zn. its acts on the wzw eld g(z, z) via

g(z, z)  e 2i

n 3g(z, z).

(4.1)

the right-moving wzw currents are invariant, while the left-moving currents transform as

jl(z)  e 2i

n 3jl(z)e

2i

n 3.

(4.2)

thus the left-moving current algebra is broken down to u(1) for n > 2 and left intact for

n = 2.

we must also choose the action of  on the left-moving internal bosons h,  = 1, . . . , 16.

without loss of generality we can take  which acts by a shift,

h  h + 2v.

(4.3)

v is dened modulo vectors from l where l is the lattice on which the h live. in addition,
the vector v must satisfy nv  l. we will dene u = nv; possible choices of u (and therefore
v) are classied by l/nl. geometrically, picking u amounts to picking a monodromy of the
gauge bundle on r4/zn\{0}.

it is convenient to think about the monodromy as due to a point-like instanton sitting

at the origin of r4/zn. the instanton charge depends on the monodromy and can be

6this remark applies equally well to type ii lsts with (1, 0) susy.

20

determined by blowing up the orbifold. then, as a consequence of the anomalous bianchi

identity dh = tr r r tr f  f , the orbifold plane has a vebrane charge which depends
on u.

from the worldsheet point of view, it is more convenient to x the wzw level k (the

analog of the vebrane charge) and ask what choices of u are allowed by modular invariance.

below we show that modular invariance requires

k +

u2
2

= 0 mod n.

(4.4)

note that since l is an even lattice, u2 is always even, and therefore there is no conict
between modular invariance and integrality of k.

in order to implement the zn action on the the wzw model, it is convenient to rewrite

the left moving sector as a product of a parafermionic su(2)/u(1) coset and a free scalar

eld . the orbifold group acts only on the free scalar. for details see e.g. [31]. the

left-moving boson  is related to the current via

 has a unit radius and obeys an ope of the form

j 3
l =

ik
2

.

 acts on  via

(z)(0) = 

2
k

log z +    .

   +

4
n

.

the partition function of the orbifolded theory can be written schematically as

zorb =

1
n

n1

(p, q),

xp,q=0

(4.5)

where (p, q) corresponds to the contribution twisted by p with q inserted in the trace.

the untwisted partition function projected onto the invariant states is given by the terms

with p = 0. the twist operator which takes us to the sector twisted by w is given by

iw

n (k+uh)

w  e

21

(4.6)

a primary from the wth twisted sector has a generic form

w(z)vjr,mr(z)vjl,ml(z)eih .

(4.7)

where   l. (for  = 0 the last factor must be replaced with h.) requiring hl  hr  z
we get

w 2ml +

wk

n ! + w  u +

w2u2
2n

= 0 mod n.

(4.8)

setting w = 1 and taking into account that 2ml  z we obtain eq. (4.4). let us dene
an integer  by  = (k + u2/2)/n. requiring that operators in dierent sectors be mutually

local we obtain a quantization condition on ml in the wth twisted sector:

2ml +   u + w = 0 mod n

(4.9)

with this quantization condition eq. (4.8) is satised for all w.

we now consider some special choices for u. the simplest choice is u = 0. then the

action of  on h is trivial and the worldsheet cft has unbroken g current algebra. a

closely related cft was considered in ref. [31]. from the space-time point of view u = 0
means that the monodromy of the at connection on r4/zn\{0} is taken to be trivial. for
n > 2 we thus nd an lst with global symmetry u(1)l  su(2)r  g. for n = 2  acts
trivially on the su(2)l currents and the symmetry is su(2)l  su(2)r  g. the n = 2
model is identical to the d-series lsts of section ii.

for g = spin(32)/z2 we may also take u = (2, 0, . . . , 0). for n > 2 the monodromy

corresponding to this u breaks the left-moving internal current algebra from so(32) down

to so(30)  u(1). the case n = 2 is special in that none of the gauge bosons of g are
projected out and the gauge symmetry algebra is still so(32) and the su(2)l also remains

unbroken. thus the symmetry algebra is the same as for the d-series lsts. moreover,

for n = 2 the condition eq. (4.4) becomes k + 2 = 0 mod 2, which is the same as for the

d-series lsts. nonetheless, this theory is not identical to the d-series lst, because 

acts nontrivially on spinors of spin(32)/z2. as a result, the global symmetry group of this

22

theory is (spin(32)/z2  su(2)l)/z2, where the second z2 reverses the sign of the spinor
of spin(32)/z2 and generates the center of su(2)l.

for g = e8  e8 an analogous choice is u = (2, 0, . . . , 0) for the rst e8 and u =
(0, . . . , 0) for the second e8. for n > 2 this leads to lsts with global symmetry algebra

u(1)l  u(1)  so(14)  e8. for n = 2 we get instead su(2)l  so(16)  e8.

none of the above models corresponds to vebranes near a perturbative heterotic orbifold

with the standard embedding of the spin connection into the gauge connection. the latter

has a monodromy which breaks so(32) down to su(2)  u(1)  so(28) and e8  e8 down to
u(1)  e7  e8. (for n = 2 it only breaks so(32) down to su(2)  su(2)  so(28) and e8  e8
down to su(2)  e7  e8.) to get such a spectrum of unbroken gauge bosons we need to set
u = (1, 1, 0, . . . , 0) for g = spin(32)/z2; for g = e8  e8 we need to set u = (1, 1, 0, . . . , 0)
for the rst e8 and u = (0, . . . , 0) for the second e8.

v. conclusions

in this paper we constructed a variety of heterotic lsts arising from heterotic string

theory in linear dilaton backgrounds. for each ane dynkin diagram of type a, d, or e

we constructed a worldsheet cft which is holographic to a heterotic (1, 0) lst with global

symmetry su(2)l  su(2)r  g, where su(2)r is the r-symmetry and g = spin(32)/z2
or e8  e8. the a-series are heterotic vebranes in at space. the d-series correspond to
vebranes near an r4/z2 orbifold with a trivial gauge connection. the e-series do not admit

a geometric description either in heterotic string theory or m-theory. in particular, we found

that a single heterotic vebrane admits a well-dened holographic dual (for either choice of

g). this is in contrast with a single type ii vebrane, which apparently does not lead to a

decoupled poincare-invariant theory and does not admit a holographic description [17].

we studied the spectrum of chiral operators in these theories using worldsheet methods.

we found that in all models there are operators which are singlets of g and are traceless

symmetric tensors of so(4)  su(2)lsu(2)r. the orders of the tensors are in one-to-one

23

correspondence with the orders of the casimirs of the corresponding ade lie group. this

part of the spectrum is very similar to that of type ii lsts [14]. there are also operators

which are charged under g. however, comparison with the large n limit revealed that many

chiral operators are missed by the worldsheet analysis. in particular, we did not nd any

self-dual three-forms expected for e8  e8 lsts, or any evidence for the sp(k + 1) gauge
group for spin(32)/z2 lsts.

we compared the chiral operators of the lst describing spin(32)/z2 heterotic vebranes

with chiral operators of the yang-mills theory describing type i d5 branes. we found that

the adjoints of spin(32)/z2 match precisely between the two theories. the above-mentioned

traceless symmetric tensors of so(4) also almost match, but for n5 > 1 the lst has one

more of them than the yang-mills theory. we suggested several possible viewpoints on this

discrepancy. the most intriguing one is that along some at directions of the lst certain

modes become free in the yang-mills theory but not in the full lst. if this possibility is

realized, then the linear dilaton backgrounds we considered describe heterotic lsts innitely

far along such at directions rather than at the origin of the moduli space.

finally, we have constructed linear dilaton backgrounds which describe heterotic ve-

branes near orbifold singularities of the form r4/zn. the orbifold does not have to be

a perturbative orbifold with zero vebrane charge; rather, when the vebrane charge of

the orbifold plane is nonzero, modular invariance requires the level of the wzw model to

be shifted appropriately (see eq. (4.4)). we also pointed out that it may be possible to

construct nongeometric backgrounds with linear dilaton by gauging accidental symmetries

of wzw models at special values of the level.

it would be interesting to check whether

modular-invariant orbifolds of this sort really exist.
