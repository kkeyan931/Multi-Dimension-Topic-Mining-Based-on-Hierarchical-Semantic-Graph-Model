abstract: born-infeld nonlinear electrodynamics with point singularities having
both electric and magnetic charges are considered. problem of interaction between
the associated soliton dyon solutions is investigated. for the case of long-range inter-
action at rst order by a small eld of distant solitons we obtain that the generalized
lorentz force is acted on a dyon under consideration. short-range interaction between
two dyons having identical electric and opposite magnetic charges is investigated for
an initial approximation. we consider the case when the velocities of the dyons have
equal modules and opposite directions on a common line. it is shown that the associ-
ated eld conguration has a constant full angular momentum which is independent
of the interdyonic distance and their speed. this property permits a consideration
of this bidyon conguration as an electromagnetic model of charged particle with
spin. we numerically investigate movement of the dyons in this conguration for
the case when the full electric charge equals the electron charge and the full angu-
lar momentum equals the electron spin. it is shown that for this case the absolute
value of relation between electric and magnetic charges of the dyons equals the ne
structure constant. the calculation gives that the bidyon may behave as nonlinear
oscillator. associated dependence of frequency on the full energy is obtained for the
initial approximation. in the limits of the electrodynamic model we obtain that the
quick-oscillating wave packet may behave like massive gravitating particle when it
move in high background eld. we discuss the possible electrodynamic world with
the oscillating bidyons as particles.

solitons in nonlinear electrodynamics may behave like real particles. this analogy
with classical particles is manifested when we consider a long-range interaction of
solitons by a perturbation method [1, 2]. in this case a soliton is subjected to the
lorentz force in the rst order by a eld of distant solitons. the second order may
give the solitons trajectory in the form of geodesic line for some eective riemann
space with metric depending on the eld of distant solitons. thus we have also
an analogy with gravitating particles. moreover, light beams distortion under the
action of some given eld may appear as gravitational distortion [3]. these properties
(in particular) provoke interest to nonlinear electrodynamic models in the context
of possible unifying description for the real material world.
in the framework of

1

this approach it may hope to solve the problem of unication electromagnetism and
gravitation.

here we shall consider an interaction of singular solitons in born-infeld nonlin-
ear electrodynamics1. the investigation of this nonlinear electrodynamic model with
point singularities of eld is presented in the article [6], where we have considered the
singularities with electric charge. but the models system of equations for electro-
magnetic eld has an exact solution which has non-zero divergence for both elds of
electric d and magnetic b inductions at the singular point. that is, this point for
the solution has both electric and magnetic charges. the particle with both electric
and magnetic charges had been named by j. schwinger as dyon (see [7]). because the
singular solution looks like point charged particle [6], we name this eld conguration
as dyon. in the present article we consider an interaction between these dyons and
we consider some quick-oscillating two-dyons eld conguration. we also consider
like-gravitational interaction of a quick-oscillating wave packet with given eld.

2. basic relation for eld

let us state the basic relation for the born-infeld nonlinear electrodynamics with
singularities [6] generalized to the case with both electric and magnetic charges. we
shall use an inertial coordinate system in minkowskian space: {x} (the greek
indexes take values 0, 1, 2, 3 ). that is, components of metric is independent of time
x0 and |g00| = 1 , g0i = 0 (the latin indexes take values 1, 2, 3 ). in this case (see
also [6]) we can write the following nonlinear maxwell system of equations:

divb = 4 0

divd = 4 0

0 b + rote = 4 
0 d  roth = 4

,

,

,

(2.5)

where t  are components of symmetrical energy-momentum tensor

(see [6] where we designated it as t



).

then, from relations (2.2) we can obtain the following relation (see also [8, 9]):

where

h = q1 + 2 (d2 + b2) + 4 p 2 =
= q(1 + 2 d2) (1 + 2 b2)  4 (d  b)2

.

(2.7)

using relations (2.6) we can consider system (2.1) as the system of equations
for elds d, b . this representation is best suitable for investigation of the singular
dyon solutions.

let us introduce the two electromagnetic potentials a , a . in our case the
potentials have singular line for each singular charged point (in three-dimensional

3

space). we must exclude such line from space when consider any ordinary dierential
eld model. the alternative way is connected with using distributions or generalized
functions. as described by p.a.m. dirac for monopoles [10], in this case we must
include some distributions into denitions of the potentials through derivatives. but
here we shall adhere to the rst way associated with exclusion of the singular lines.
note that the singular currents into equations (2.1) set boundary conditions at the
singular points (see [6]). in contrast, we shall take natural boundary conditions at
the singular lines outside of the singular points.

thus we dene the potentials outside of any singular set with help the following

formulas:

f = a  a

,

f  =   a

,

where 123 = |g|1/2 , 123 = |g|1/2 , (|g00| = 1 , g0i = 0 ).

we have the following denition in three-dimensional designations:

b =   a
d =   a
h =  a0 + 0 a
e = a0  0a

3. boundary conditions at the singular points

let us integrate system of equations (2.1) over a small four-dimensional space region
including only n -th singular point. using the partial integration in four-dimensional
space we obtain the following conditions:

because the surface
tions at the n -th singular point.

n
 may be arbitrarily small, relations (3.2) are boundary condi-

there is the attractive idea, proposed by a.s. eddington [5], about an invariance
of theory under permutation of points of space. we can apply this idea to the singular
points. let the model be invariant under permutation of any two singular points in
n2
the sense of change their charges
b. because the theory is invariant
under change of charges sign, in this case we have for any singular point

d

b =  b
where d and b are some positive constants of space.

d =  d ,

n

,

(3.3)

thus we have the theory with three dimensional constants  , d and b . for
the suitable dimensional system we can take  = 1 and d = 1 or b = 1 . thus we
have the relation d/b as the single dimensionless constant of the theory. below (in
section 9) we shall connect this relation with the ne structure constant.

4. dyon solutions and singularities

system of equations (2.1) with relations (2.6) has the following exact dyon solution
in a cartesian coordinate system {y} :

the vector function  (y) may be of two types: with innite singular line and with

function (4.3a) has the innite singular line coinciding with the axis y3 and
functions (4.3b) has the semi-innite singular line in positive direction of y3 .

a spherical coordinate system {r, , } the both functions  (y) have non-zero

accordingly.

at the singular line the potentials a, a are devoid of dened direction and their
absolute values are innity. at the singular point r = 0 the vectors e, h, d, b are
devoid of dened direction and absolute values of d, b are innity.

the full electromagnetic energy (see (6.3) below) of dyon solution (4.1) is

the dyons energy has a space localization region. let us denote the sphere-
enclosed dyons energy as e  for radius of the sphere r . center of the sphere is at
the origin of the coordinates {yi} . the numerical calculation gives that e  = 0.5 e
for r = r and e  = 0.95 e for r = 10 r .
with help of lorentz transformation, shift, and rotation of the coordinate system

5. variational principle for two potentials

here we propose some action such that the associated variational principle gives
system of equations (2.1) with relations (2.6) and boundary conditions (3.2). this
action has the following form:

s = z h(l + 1) + 2 2(cid:16) a   a(cid:17)ig (dx)4

,

(5.1)

2
2

where

l   h +
(e  d + h  b)
h = h(d, b) according to (2.7),
e, b are represented by a and d, h are represented by a with (2.10).

(5.2)

,

using denition (2.5) we can easy write also the following expression for l :

.

(5.3)

l = 

1

2 (cid:16)l + l(cid:17)

7

thus the action s is invariant under general transformation of coordinates.

if we substitute expression (5.3) for l into the action s and take into account
that l = l(a), l = l( a) , then independent formal variation of eight com-
ponents of the potentials a, a for the principle s = 0 gives the following eight
equations:

1
|g|



x "|g|

( a)# = 4  ,
l

1
|g|



x "|g|

( a)# =  4  .
l

(5.4)

for simplicity we didnt consider here the singular lines of the potentials.

formally we can consider system of equations (2.1) with relations (2.2) as the
system of eight equations for the eight unknown functions a, a ((2.1a),(2.1b) for
a and (2.1a),(2.1b) for a). such system of equations agree with system (5.4).
now let us consider the action s (5.1) with the function l in form (5.2). in
this case the dependence of lagrangian on the derivatives of potentials diers from
one that we have for the function l in form (5.3). thus the appropriate variational
principles with the function l in forms (5.2) and (5.3) are dierent.

substituting denitions (2.10), (2.3), (2.4) into (5.1) we obtain the following

expression for the action that doesnt contain  -functions:

s = z (l + 1)q|g| (dx)4 +

the n singular points. next we contract the surfaces
as result we have s  s .

let us nd stationary conditions for the action s . by the general principle of

a = 0 at rst. we can also take
calculus of variations [11], we can take 
continuous variations a,  a and make, rstly, a = 0,  a = 0 at the singular
lines. then, according to the rst line in expression (5.7), we have

n

in the space outside of the singular lines. using denition of the elds b, d, e, h
through potentials (2.10), we obtain from equations (5.8) that

e =

h
d

,

h =

2

h

(5.9)

now we take a 6= 0 and  a 6= 0 at the singular lines for continuous variations
a,  a . we assume that the elds d, b, e, h are continuous at the singular lines
outside the segregated singular points. then we obtain boundary conditions (3.2)
from expression (5.7) (line 2-4), using formulas (5.9).

finally, we take 

lines

n

a 6= 0 , 



a 6= 0 . it would appear reasonable that at the singular
0z

l d  = 0 .

(5.10)

lim

then, from the last line in (5.7) we have the following condition at the n -th singular
point:

(cid:28)n
d(cid:18)e +

n

v  b(cid:19) +

n

b(cid:18)h 

n

v  d(cid:19)(cid:29)n

= 0

.

(5.11)

n
b = 0 ), which had
this condition generalize one for purely electrical singularity (
obtained in the article [6], to the case of dyon singular point. using denition of
singular currents (2.3) we obtain also the following form of the condition:

f  

1
2

 f   = 0

.

(5.12)

thus the variational principle for action s (5.1), (5.5) gives system of equations

(2.1) and point boundary conditions (3.2), (5.11).

notice that here we dont use a concrete form for the function h(d, b) . thus

this derivation is suitable for any electrodynamic models.

6. conservation laws and comments about dimensions

using equations (2.1) with formulas (2.6) and condition (5.12) we can check directly
the following conservation law for symmetrical energy-momentum tensor (in cartesian
coordinates):

where

t 
x = 0

,

,

t 00 = 2 (h  1)
t 0i = ijl dj bl = ijl ej hl
t ij = ij [d  e + b  h  t 00]  (di ej + bi h j)

,

(6.1)

(6.2)

.

let us introduce the following notations for full energy and momentum in the

region  of three-dimensional space  .

e =

1

4 2z



(h  1) d ,

p =

1

4z



p d ,

(6.3)

where p i  t 0i or p  d  b .

10

let the region  may be moving, that is we have  = (x0) . then, by
integration of conservation law (6.1) over the region  we obtain the following
integral conservation law for energy-momentum:

de
dx0 = 
dp i
dx0 = 

1

4 z
4z

1

p  d  

t ij dj 

1

4 2 z
4z

1

p i d0

,

(h  1) d0

,

(a)

(b)

(6.4)

where  is the surface that bounds the region  ,
is the external element of this surface,

dj
d0   v  d  ,

v is the velocity of surfaces point.

it is evident, from (6.1) we have also the following conservation law for angular

momentum tensor:

where

m 
x = 0

,

m  = t  x  t  x

.

(6.5)

(6.6)

we introduce the following notation for vector of full angular momentum in the

region  :

m =

1

4z



(p  x) d .

(6.7)

let us take up somewhat the dimensions of the quantities. because we dont
explicitly use the speed of light c , the temporary coordinate x0 has a dimension
identical to that for the space coordinates xi , that is dimension of length. (but we
can make substitution x0  c t for all time.) for the same reason the momentum
has a dimension identical to that for the energy. and dimension of the full angular
momentum is [m] = [p ] [x] = [e] [x] . in this case the dimension of mass is identical
to that for the energy.

7. method for investigation of interaction between dyons

we shall consider system (2.1) with relations (2.6) as system of equations for the
elds d, b . let us write this system in the following formal operational form:

nd = 0 ,

where d    d

b! .

(7.1)

11

we can search a solution of equation (7.1) in the form of the following formal

series:

d = d(0) + d1) + d2) + ...

,

d(k)  d(0) +

k

xl=1 dl)

,

(7.2)

where d(0)
dk)
d(k)

is an initial approximation,
is k-th correction,
is k-th approximation.

let us expand the operator n into equation (7.1) near to the k -th approxima-
tion d(k) and keep only linear terms by the correction dk+1) . thus we obtain the
following equation for the correction:

nn hd(k)iodk+1) =  nd(k)
where n  is frechets derivative for the operator n .

,

(7.3)

equation (7.3) gives the following iterative process, which is called newtons

method for operators [12]:

d(k+1) = d(k)  nn hd(k)io1hn d(k)i

.

(7.4)

an alternative possible way is based on using the principle of contractive map-

pings. let us rewrite system (7.1) in the following form:

md = nd ,

where

nd  md  nd

(7.5)

and m is the operator represented by left parts of linear maxwell equations for
d = e , b = h .
in this case we can easy obtain the appropriate inverse operator m1 . as result

we have the following representation for equation (7.1):

d = m1 n d .

(7.6)

if the operator m1 n is contractive (for some given class of functions including
the initial approximation), then the iterative process

d(k+1) = m1 n d(k)

(7.7)

converges to the solution.

the convergence of iterative processes (7.4), (7.7) to some solution is dened
by conditions that depend on initial approximation [12]. but we can use these
procedures, even if it doesnt converge. in this case we may have some number of
iteration for best approximation to the solution. in any case the initial approximation
d(0) must be suciently close to some exact solution.

12

we can take the sum of some solutions as initial approximation. let us take

moving dyons

n

d (4.6) as these solutions. thus we have

d(0) =

n

xn

n

d .

(7.8)

the eld conguration d, b for the exact moving dyon solution has six free
parameters: three components of the velocity and three components of the initial
position. we can assume that these parameters for the dyons into initial approxima-
tion (7.8) are functions of time. this is standard practice for similar problems. but,
as it can show, if we take that the initial positions depend on time, then boundary
conditions (3.2b) are broken for the dyon eld conguration. thus we may have only
three components of velocity as dyons parameters depending on time.

we believe that each dyon has an optional trajectory x =

n
a(x0) such that

n
yi =

n
li

j(cid:16)xj 

n

n

j =

n
li
j(

n

,

(7.9)

where

n
yi are included into expressions (4.1a),(4.1b),
n
li

j are included into expressions (4.6a).

the trajectories

n
a(x0) must be obtained.

in the same manner as for eld we can represent the functions

following series:

n
a(x0) by the

n
a =

n
a(0) +

n
a1) +

n
a2) + ...

,

n

a(k) 

n
a(0) +

n
al)

,

k

xl=1

(7.10)

where

n
a(0)
n
ak)
n
a(k)

is the trajectory of n-th dyon for the initial approximation,
is k-th correction to the trajectory,
is k-th approximation for the trajectory.

.

if we have obtained the trajectories in initial approximation

n
a(0)(x0) with help
some method, then we can obtain the rst correction d1) as solution to equation
(7.3) or from formula (7.7) for k = 0 . this correction d1)
is a radiation of the
n
a(0)(x0) . but the radiation of the
dyons accelerated according to their trajectories
n
a1)
dyons modies their trajectories. we describe these modications by functions
n
ak) to the
that correct the trajectories
n
a(k1) in any step of iteration. in eect, this is a correction of the initial
trajectories
approximation (through the correction of the trajectories) for every iteration step.

n
a(0) . thus we must obtain the corrections

a direct calculation gives that all boundary conditions (3.2), (5.11) are satised
for initial eld conguration (7.8) with (7.9) and optional trajectories of the dyons.
this is distinction of this method from one that had used in the article [6], where
we take the four components of the potential a as unknown functions. but using

13

the elds d, b as unknown functions, the present method is more suitable for
satisfaction to all point boundary conditions in any iteration step.

in the present article we shall use integral energy-momentum conservation law

(6.4) for obtaining trajectories of the interacting dyons.

n
d ,

notice also the following. because near n -th singular point absolute values of
n
the elds
b tends to innity, for any nite given external eld (of other dyons)
we can dene some neighbourhood of the singular point, where this external eld
may be believed to be small. thus the consideration of any (small) distances between
the dyons in initial approximation may be worthwhile.

8. interaction of dyon with a small given eld

n

let us consider the interaction of moving dyon with a small given eld

di
n
b ) in initial approximation. in particular, this small
h 
( i = 1, ..., 6 ), (
eld may represent the eld of other dyons that are at suciently long distance from
the dyon under consideration.

e 

n
d ,

n

n

in this case we consider the space region

sideration only. the region

a maximal absolute value of the functions

n
 that include the dyon under con-
n
 move with n -th singularity together. we can take
n
 as the small order
n
 . here
n
 has more size than one for dyon localization

in the region

di

n

parameter  for the problem of nding the rst approximation in the region

we consider the case when the region
region (see section (4)).

thus for the region

n
 we take

d(0) =

n

d +

n

d .

(8.1)

for obtaining dyons trajectory equation we use formula (6.4b). we consider the
n
 . thus we have

d is approximately constant into the region

case when the eld

n

dp(0)

is much more than r (4.2).

now we expand the components t ij as taylor series near the n -th dyons eld
conguration. we restrict the consideration to the terms of no more than the rst
order by  . thus we have

we substitute (8.2), (8.3), (8.6) into relation (6.4b) and make the integration for
its right part. because the symmetry properties of element of integration, the last

as we see, the energy-momentum method for obtaining the trajectories gives the
value of mass which is equal to rest energy of the dyon. this result fully conform
with einsteins principle for equivalence of mass to energy.

in the article [6] we considered the potentials a as unknown functions and used
the boundary condition of type (5.11) for obtaining the trajectory equation. as result
e ) than in the
we had obtained another value of mass in initial approximation ( 3
2
present article. generally speaking, we have certain arbitrariness for taking an initial
trajectory of the singularity. because a true trajectory of the singularity is dened
by an exact solution only, we can obtain corrections to the initial trajectory (in rst
and highest iteration steps) such that it will appear as renormalization of mass. but
the method of the present article is more suitable, because it gives the satisfaction
as energy-momentum conservation law (6.4) as boundary condition (5.11) for any
iteration step.

opposite magnetic charges:
system {z, , } such that dyons are on the axis z . we believe also that the dyons

plane z = 0 . this conguration is shown in gure 2, where d =  d , b =  b .

here we may take the innite singular lines with function  of type (4.4a).
in this case the singular lines for the potential a particularly cancel each other
outside of the interval between the dyons. this cancelling is complete as z   
or a  0 . if we also believe that at the singular points the eld d of the bidyon
solution are equal to the eld for the dyon solution
d , we must believe that
the exact solution has the potential a with the function  of type (4.4b) at the
singular points. thus we can presume that the potential a for the associated exact
solution has the singular line segment between the dyons only. that is we have a
singular string segment (for a ) with the dyons at the ends.

let us calculate the full angular momentum for eld conguration (9.1). we use

of elements of integration into (6.7), for this case we have m = m = 0 ,

z =

a sin

we have the bispherical element of value

(cosh   cos )3

and substituting (9.6), (9.7), (9.9) into (9.4) we obtain the following expression for
z -component of the full angular momentum:

thus we have

mz = 2 b d .

(9.11)

(9.12)

as we see, the full angular momentum is independent of the interdyonic distance and
their speed! it is evident that this result is typical for any electrodynamics model,
i.e. the form of the function h(d, b) is immaterial.

the property, that the full angular momentum is independent of the internal
movement parameters, permits a consideration of the bidyon as an electromagnetic
model for charged particle with spin. the charge of this particle is 2 d and its spin is
equal to |mz| . we set 2 d = e , were e is the absolute value of the electron charge,
and |mz| =

now we shall nd the trajectory a(x0) in initial approximation. for this purpose
we use the integral energy conservation law for full three-dimensional space. the full
energy of initial eld conguration (9.1) is depend on the distance between the dyons
a and on the speed v : e = e(a, v ) . on the trajectory a(x0) the full energy is
constant. thus we can obtain the trajectory with help the following formula:

x0 =

v (a, e)

,

(9.14)

where v (a, e) is the inverse function to the function e(a, v ) .

it is evident that we have a family of the trajectories for all possible values of

the energy.

but in fact, the energy depend on square of the speed. thus we can obtain the

let us obtain the function e(a, v 2) . we shall use a numerical calculation for
the energy integral. but at rst we obtain some interesting approximate formula for
the energy in the case of very small distance between the dyons and their speed is
not very close to the speed of light. we substitute the eld d(0)
into expression
for h (2.7) and use formulas for bispherical coordinates (9.6) and (9.8). we obtain
that as a  0 the main term of the radicand is 4 (p)2 , which is proportional to
(a)8 . thus for very small values of a we have the following formula:

(9.15)) is directed to the region with a greater rest energy!

notice, the sum

d are considered here as initial approximation, in particular,
for very small distance between the singularities ( 2 a  r ). however, as indicated
above (see the end of section 7) this may be rightful, because absolute value of
the dyons elds d, b are innity at the singular point. thus we can hope that
our iterative procedures (7.4) or (7.7) with this initial approximation can give an
approximated solution. in any case the investigation of eld conguration (9.1) may
give leading considerations for obtaining the solution.

now we present the results of numerical calculations2 for the function e(a, v 2) .
we used the dimensional system in which  = 1 and r = 1 . in this dimensional

2here we had used fortran program with nag library (function d01daf for integration in two

dimensions).

19

system the energy of d(0) for a =  and v = 0 is 2 e = 4/3  2.4721 (see (4.5)),
and equality a = 1 implies that a = r in other dimensional system. according to
(9.13), (4.2) we have d =  b , b = (1 + 2) 1
2 in this dimensional system. we made
the calculation for a = 0.00004  4 and v 2 = 0  0.95 . in order to make the best
r   ), we
convergence of the integral (both near the singular points and as
divide the space of integration on two part. in the rst part, which is bounded by
the sphere with radius 20  40 , we used the bispherical coordinates. and outside
this sphere but inside the sphere with radius 200  1000 we used the spherical
coordinates. the precision for obtained results of calculations is no more than 5% .
as noted above the eective mass for the internal movement of the dyons in
d(0) may be negative for very small distance between the dyons. but, of course,
as a   this mass is positive. thus there are an inectional line in coordinates
(a, v 2) on which the mass is equal to zero. we denote the point of intersection this
line with the axes a as a . that is

according our numerical calculations a  4.6  103 and value of the energy e(a, 0)
is near 4/3 . it is possible that this is her exact value. this point (a, 0) in some
sense is dual to the point (, 0) where the energy is e = 2 e . we shall also see this
duality below in the context of obtained trajectories a(x0) .
the numerical calculations give that for a < a and v = 0 the values of the
energy practically equal to ones given by formula (9.18). but this agreement disap-
pears as the speed v increase. the appropriate results show in gure 3. (the values
calculated by formula (9.18) show with discontinuous line.)

the best agreement with the numerical results is given by addition the term

with the numerical result. by addition the terms (cid:16) v 2
, where n = 2, 3, 4 , to
formula (9.20) we can obtain a formula, which gives very good approximation for the
results of numerical calculations (for a < a and v 2 < 0.95 ). this formula has the

0.5 to 2.3 with step 0.1 we numerically calculate the frequency with help of formula
(9.24)3. as result we obtain the function (e) . the obtained dependence (e) is
shown in gure 8. the dual points (a, v ) = (a, 0) and (, 0) are unstable points
of rest with the energy 2 e . the appropriate period is innity and the frequency is

now we consider the movement in the region a < a . the lines with constant

let us consider the line in gure 10
that correspond to sole value of the energy. as we see in this gure, if for an initial
instant of time the speed is zero ( v = 0 ), then the dyons begin to approach each
other from the points a = a(e) and quick gather a high speed. according to the
all formulas for the energy in the region a < a ( (9.18), (9.20) and (9.22) ) we have

in gure 10 the dyons may
have two dierent values of the speed for one value of the energy. in principle, the

[amax  a2, amax] we approximated the function e(a, v 2) by a linear

system may jump from one branch of the constant energy line to another. and in the
initial approximation there are not any criterion for choosing between these branches.
but in rst approximation we take into account a radiation of the dyons. because an
amplitude of the radiation depend on acceleration, we can propose that this radiation
will prevent for the jumping (with innite acceleration). thus we believe that the
bidyon system in initial approximation moves from the point a = a , v = 0 to
the point a on the bottom (in the gure) branch of the constant energy line. at
the point a = a the acceleration on the trajectory is innity and direction of the

24

velocity is changed to opposite one. from the point a the dyons may move on the
top branch ( a   ) or come back on the bottom one. of course, near this point
the radiation plays a signicance role for the movement. thus we can suppose that
the bidyon dynamical system stop short of the point with innite acceleration and
come back on the branch with less speed, that is the bottom branch. in this case we
have the periodical motion between the points a and a .

we shall numerically calculate the period for this periodical motion. but at rst
we shall have obtained some analytical result for an idealized case.
if we have a
dynamical system with energy given by formula (9.18), then we have her trajectory

as we see, in this case the energy is proportional to the frequency! the system
moves from the point a = a to the point a = 0 and come back. in keeping with
the conservation of full angular momentum, the dyons may not change places. at
the point a = 0 the speed is equal to the speed of light v = 1 , for this idealized
system.

now we present a dependence (e) that numerically calculated by formula
(9.22) for the energy. as noted, this formula very good approximate the numerically
calculated function e(a, v ) . in gure 11 we have the plot for numerically calculated
function (e) (continuous line), asymptote e = 2 e , and dependence (e) for
idealized motion (9.27) (discontinuous lines).
as we see,    ( t  0 ) when the energy approached 2 e from above, in
contrast to the case when the energy approached 2 e from below.
we can derive also a formula that will better approximate for the numerically
calculated function (e) . let us take movement (9.26) of idealized system (9.18).
but we shall suppose that the system stop short of the point a = 0 and come
back from some point a 6= 0 . we shall have obtained this point from approximate
formula (9.20). this formula considered as equation with their associated equation

thus we have considered the internal movement of the bidyon for initial ap-
d . the appropriate rst
proximation, which is the sum of the dyons elds
approximation is connected with the radiation of the dyons. the oscillating bidyon
in initial approximation may give rise to some standing wave in rst approximation.
according to properties of the radiation for accelerated charge, an amplitude of this
standing wave is zero at innity of three-dimensional space. in this sense we can call
it as restricted standing wave. the standing wave may change the trajectory a(x0) .

thus we shall have an energy interchange between the initial approximation and the
standing wave. some equilibrium oscillating eld conguration may exist for this
case. because this problem has two-point boundary conditions, it is possible that
the bidyon oscillating system will have some discrete set of allowable frequencies.

furthermore, the oscillating bidyon will interact with any plane waves, which
are exact solutions of the model [3]. the resonance interaction will intercept the
plane waves with bidyons frequencies. as result we shall have some non-restricted
(in three-dimensional space) standing wave connected with the oscillating bidyon.
thus it is valid to say that such oscillating eld conguration occupies whole three-
dimensional space. of course, near the singular points this conguration has a lo-
calization region, but the associated non-restricted standing wave has some nite
amplitude at innity.

we can represent the oscillating bidyon solution by fourier series in time coor-
dinate. thus we have the following series for the solution in own coordinate system
y :

d =



xf =df exp(cid:16)if  y0(cid:17)

,

(9.32)

where  

2
t

, df = df (yi, ) , are complex column-function given by the formula

df =

1
2

t

z0

d exp(cid:16)if  y0(cid:17) dy0

.

(9.33)

with help lorentz transformation we can obtain from (9.32) the following moving

27

bidyon solution:



d =

xf =df exp (if )

,

(9.34)

where  = k x , k k =  2 , and the elds df , bf (for the column df )
are connected with the elds df , bf (for the column df ) by formulas of lorentz
transformation (4.6a) with functions e(d, b) , h(d, b) (2.6).

10. eect of gravitational interaction

in the article [3] we had considered the distortion of a small amplitude quick-
oscillating wave against the background of a high eld, for this nonlinear electrody-
namic model. we had shown that this distortion coincide with light beams distortion
in gravitational eld with the following metric:

g = g  2 t 

,

(10.1)

where g
tensor t  is formulated from the background eld.

is the metric of basic minkowskian space and the energy-momentum

bidyon solution (9.34) has the quick-oscillating wave part. as distinct from light
wave, this wave has the rest frequency  . but we can presume that this wave (in
the region with small amplitude of it) will have the analogous behavior that light
wave.

thus let us consider the problem for propagation of the small amplitude quick-
oscillating wave with the rest frequency against a high eld background. here we
shall use a method that some distinct from one, which used in the article [3]. let us
take the cartesian coordinate system {x} with the metric g = h such that

|h00| = |h11| = |h22| = |h33| = 1 ,

h = 0 for  6= 

.

(10.2)

in this section we dont dene one of two signatures of the minkowskian metric:
( + ++) or (+  ) .

in this coordinate system we have the following form of equation (2.12) for the

potential a outside of the singular set:

c  2a

xx = 0 .

(10.3)

let we have a small eld conguration a(y) , which is periodical on y0 with

circular frequency  and satises the maxwell equations

c  2 a

yy = 0

,

(10.4)

28

where

c  = h h  h h

.

this eld conguration may represent the quick-oscillating part of the bidyon solu-
tion (9.32) in the region where the electromagnetic eld is small and the nonlinearity
can be neglected. with help the lorentz transformation we can obtain also an appro-
priate moving eld conguration. but if we have its moving against the background
of a high eld, we can presume a change for parameters of this small eld cong-

uration. let us take a solution of the model as the background eld
a and a
moving eld conguration a(x) , which is related with a(y) by some unknown
transformation. we substitute their sum

a =



a + a

(10.5)

into system of equation (10.3). taking into account that for the associated electro-

magnetic eld

and

we obtain the following equation:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

f(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)



 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
f (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

 f

x (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)



f (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)



f 
x

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

f(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(10.6)

c  2 a

xx = 0 ,

where coecients c  (2.13) include the background eld


f  only.

into some restricted region, where we can believe that the background eld is

constant, we can try to nd a coordinate transformation

dy = g

. dx

,

dx = g

. dy

,

(10.7)

which transform system of equations (10.6) to system (10.4). we shall have this
transformation if

c  = g
.

g
.

g
.

g
.

c  = g g  g g

,

(10.8)

. h is a metric associated with this transformation.

with help the direct substitution we obtain that g = g , where the metric

g

where g  g
g is dened by formula (10.1)!

.

let us write the basic relations, which connect the metric g with the trans-

formation matrixes.

g g

. g

. = h

,

g  g

.

g

. h

.

(10.9)

thus we have a solution of system (10.6) into the restricted region (where

g  const ) in the following form:

a = g
.

a(y)

.

(10.10)

29

the metric g , calculated by formula (10.1) with the background eld for
full four-dimensional space, dene some curvilinear riemann space, in general case.
thus, according to known theorem of riemann geometry, we cant consider g as
coordinate transformation tensor for full space. but we can always make the trans-
formation to the cartesian coordinates {y} for one point of four-dimensional space.
as this point we take the point {x} , where xi are three-dimensional coordinates
for some central point in a localization region of the eld a at the time moment
x0 . thus for using solution (10.10) in full four-dimensional space we must take
g
.(x0)
. = g
into formula (10.10). for the coordinates {y} we take the following expressions:

.(x) in formula (10.10). but because xi = xi(x0) we have g

. = g

yi = gi

j(cid:16)xj  xj(cid:17)

y0 = z k dx

,

,

gi

j = gi
k(x)  g0

j(x0)

(x)

xi = xi(x0)

,

,

.

(10.11)

because the solution a(y) is periodical by y0 , the proper time y0 play a role of
normalized phase for quick-oscillating wave (10.10). in this case the ordinary phase
is  y0 and the components of wave vector are  k . we have also the following
evident relations:

k
x =

k
x

.

according to formulas (10.9) and denition for k (10.11) we have

g k k = h00

,

(10.12)

(10.13)

where g = g(x) , k = k(x) .
this is dispersion relation for the quick-oscillating wave (see also [3]).

let us adopt the proper time y0(x) at the point x as parameter of motion s
for the localization region of the eld a . that is s  y0(x) . thus we have the
following denition for four-velocity:

u  

dx
ds

= g

.0(x)

.

(10.14)

denitions for u  (10.14), k (10.11) and formulas (10.9) give also the following

relations for the point {x} :

k u  = 1

,

u  = h00 g k

.

let us introduce the inverse tensor g for the tensor g :

g g = 


.

(10.15)

(10.16)

of course, within the limits of the introduced riemann space the quantities g are
components of the metric tensor with inferior indexes. but for the basic minkowskian

30

space the quantities g are components of some tensor eld and g are components
of appropriate inverse one.

from (10.15) and (10.16) we immediately obtain for the point {x} that

g u  u  = h00

.

thus we have

ds2 =

1
h00

from (10.15) we have also

g dx dx = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

g dx dx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

k =

1
h00

g u 

.

(10.17)

(10.18)

(10.19)

let us obtain an equation for the trajectory x(s) . dierentiating dispersion
relation (10.13) by some coordinate x and using relations (10.12) and expression
for u  through k (10.15) we obtain for the point {x}

g
x

k k + 2 h00 u  k

x = 0 =

g
x

k k + 2 h00 dk
ds

= 0 . (10.20)

substituting (10.19) into (10.20) and using (10.16) we obtain the trajectory equa-

tion in the following form:

where

du 
ds

+ 

 u  u  = 0 ,


 =

1
2

g g
x +

g
x 

g
x ! .

(10.21)

(10.22)

as we see, within the limits of the introduced riemann space (for which g = g ,
g = g , 

 ) this equation is geodesic line equation!

 = 

notice that here we use the primordial equation for the potential a (10.3) with-
x = 0
y = 0 for equation

out any gauge condition. it is evident, we can take the gauge condition g  a
for equation (10.6), which is transformed to the condition h  a
(10.4).

thus we have the riemann space which is induced by background eld. the
relatively small quick-oscillating wave eld conguration with rest frequency and
localized near point xi(x0) moves on geodesic lines of this riemann space. this
looks as motion of gravitating particles. thought the bidyons eld is high near the
singular points, we may presume that in some cases the quick-oscillating bidyon eld
conguration will move also on these geodesic lines. we shall discuss this question
in the following section.

31

11. nonlinear electrodynamic world with oscillating bidyons

in this section we shall discuss a possible world constructed from the great number of
the bidyon-type eld congurations. it is evident that in this world the bidyons and
its possible strong coupling combinations may play the role of particles. particles

with full angular momentum multiples to

may be constructed from some number

h
2

because

of the bidyons. it is amply clear that moving bidyon (9.34) has both particle and
wave properties.
d
b

=   1 , we may build a perturbation theory with the ne struc-
ture constant  as small parameter, for some aspects of the mathematical model
of this world. thus we have an analogy with perturbative procedure of quantum
electrodynamics.

the worlds eld conguration is solution of the models equations in whole four-
dimensional space and each dyon singularity has a determined trajectory providing
the satisfaction to the point boundary conditions. to obtain the solution for whole
space, actually we may use the method of successive approximation only. according
our method describing in section 7, the dyons trajectories are corrected for each
step of iteration with help of some integral conditions. in the present article we use
the integral conservation law of the energy-momentum for this purpose. thus this
method for obtaining the trajectories is non-local in character. we have the classical
generalized lorentz force in initial approximation, for the case when we may consider
the conservation law for the localization region of one dyon only. in general case the
integral conditions may give the following eect. if we have a change of the eld
near some distant (from the trajectory) point, then we may obtain a change of this
trajectory (without a propagation of disturbance from this distant point). this looks
as quantum behavior when events at space separated points behave as though there
is an instantaneous interaction between the events. according our concept, this
pattern may be connected with the specic iterative way on which we go (in our
calculations) to unknown worlds eld conguration in space-time.

the wave vector k of moving quick-oscillating bidyon (9.34) (without any ex-

ternal given elds) satises the following dispersion relation:

k k = h00 2

.

(11.1)

we have also the following relation for the vector of full energy-momentum of the
bidyon eld conguration:

p  p = h00 m2

,

(11.2)

where m is the full rest energy interpreted as mass.
however, because we have the non-restricted wave (with innite three-dimensional
energy integral) as a part of the bidyon conguration, how we must calculate the full

32

energy-momentum in this case is not clear. a future consideration of the problem
for motion of the bidyon with the associated quick-oscillating waves in given external
eld must give a value of the mass. we can denote the relation between the mass
and the rest frequency as c  m/ . thus we have

p = c k

.

(11.3)

to correlate between the bidyons (or multidyons) and real particles, we must
have that c = h . to determine truth or falsity of this condition for the bidyon
solution, we must have this solution and value of the mass. but the behavior of
bidyons initial approximation (9.1) at very small interdyonic distances (high ener-
gies) may suggest some optimism (see (9.27),(9.31)). of course, outside of the regions
immediately adjacent to the singular points the associated exact solution may be sig-
nicantly dierent from the initial approximation. thus this problem need further
consideration.

gravitational interaction (in the sense of bimetric gravitational theory) may
exist for the bidyon solution. the quick-oscillating part of the solution with small
amplitude will have tendency to move on geodesic line of induced by background
eld riemann space. we may presume that in some cases this tendency will be
a controlling factor for motion of the bidyon, that is the bidyon will be piloted
by its small amplitude quick-oscillating part. this case may takes place when we
have the quick-oscillating background eld such that the classical electromagnetic
interaction for the bidyon is absent because of averaging. we must presume also that
the averaging cancels the eects of associated resonance interaction. but induced
metric (10.1) includes squares of the eld and the appropriate eect will not wipe
out by averaging.

thus we may hope that the nonlinear electrodynamic world will have a correla-
tion with the real material world. in this case we could call an associated theory as
nonlinear electrodynamic theory of the world. such theory may be considered as
like einsteins unied eld theory with electromagnetic eld as basic. in the context
of this approach, all diversity of solutions and nonlinear eects for the electrody-
namic eld model must correlate with all real particles and their interactions. the
evident practical signicance of such approach consists in a possible discovery any
new real eects with help of the theoretical investigation of the model. but whilst
still we have more questions than answers on this arduous but feasible way.

12. conclusions

thus we have presented the initial theory for nonlinear born-infeld electrodynamics
with dyonic singularities. we have proposed the method for investigation of interac-
tion between the dyons. for a special case we have obtained the generalized lorentz

33

force acting on the dyon. we have introduced the concept of bidyon, interpreted
as electromagnetic model of particle with spin, and we have investigated its initial
approximation. we have obtained the eect of gravitational interaction, which ap-
pear within the limits of this electrodynamic model. we have also discussed possible
correlations between the nonlinear electrodynamic world and real material world.
