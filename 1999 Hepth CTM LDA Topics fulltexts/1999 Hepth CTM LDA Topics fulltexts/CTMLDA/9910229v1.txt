abstract

it is argued that there are states (quasiparticles) with masses rang-
ing over the scales n
c  nc in n=1 supersymmetric multicolor
gluodynamics. these states exist in the form of quantum bubbles
made out of the bps domain walls. analogous states are likely to
exist in non-supersymmetric case as well.

recently a remarkable progress in understanding supersymmetric gauge
theories took place. one of the main roles in those developments was played
by the so-called bps states which showed up practically in every instance
when some kind of exact information about a gauge theory was available.
the classical example was, of course, the construction of low energy eective
action in n=2 supersymmetric yang-mills [1], where a crucial piece of infor-
mation was obtained due to existence of the bps saturated monopoles and
dyons.

n=1 supersymmetric yang-mills also possesses the bps states. these
are domain walls [2] and (upon perturbing the theory with some operators
or upon introducing some matter) strings [3]. notice that this time the bps
states are not point-like which is, of course, much harder to work with. it may
easily happen that extendedness of the bps states in n=1 supersymmetric
gluodynamics is the reason why it is less treatable compared to the n=2
theory. anyway, the role of the bps extended objects in dynamics of n=1
theory is still to be understood, though there are permanent advances (see,
e.g.
[4]-[7]) of which the most inspiring for the present note was the paper
[4]).

c  nc.

the paper [4] was concentrated about the fact that the bps domain wall
width scales as 1/nc at large nc. the point of the paper was that such be-
havior of the width assumes existence of heavy particles, m  nc (of which
the wall could be done) in the spectrum of multicolor n=1 supersymmetric
gluodynamics, in addition to the traditional glueballs whose mass is inde-
pendent of nc in the multicolor limit. it is worth stressing that these heavy
particles were argued in [4] to exist in the non-supersymmetric gluodynamics
too.

the purpose of the present note is to suggest a candidate for these heavy
particles. we argue that they can, in turn, be done out of the bps walls,
namely, in the form of quantum bubbles done out of the bps walls.
it
happens that at large nc these bubbles can be treated semiclassically, the
thing wall approximation being applicable (because a typical radius of the
bubble is much bigger than the wall width). masses of these bubbles range
over the scales n 1/3

the bps domain walls in n=1 supersymmetric gluodynamics were intro-
duced in [2]. they interpolate between the nc vacua distinguished by the
value of gluino condensate. the tension of the wall between two adjacent
vacua is of the order of nc3, where  stands for the scale of the theory.
it is instructive to discuss the domain walls at large nc in the framework
of m-theory, where they are represented as m5 branes wrapped on some cy-
cles [5]. this construction naturally explains that the wall tension scales as
[6] that the domain wall width  scales as
nc. later it was argued in refs.
[6], were supplemented in [4] by consid-
  1/nc. the arguments of refs.
ering the nc-behavior [3] of the wall junctions [8] and by studying various
eective lagrangians.

quantum bubbles (in a scalar theory with spontaneous symmetry break-
ing) were introduced in [9], where they arose as resonant states in the multi-
particle production at a threshold. let us remind main points concerning
those bubbles. the action in the thin wall approximation reads

where  stands for the tension of the wall. corresponding hamiltonian reads

s = 4z dtr21  r2

with the canonical momentum p. the classical trajectory with energy e
corresponds to oscillations of the bubble between the turning point

r = r0 = ( e

bubble would quickly dissipate into outgoing waves. below we give some ar-
guments that this is not the case. the bubble becomes stable in the large nc
limit. therefore for the moment we proceed discussing bubbles in assumption
of their stability.

the part of the trajectory near zero radius, r  , cannot be described
within the thin wall approximation. however in the case that r0   (which
we show below is indeed the case) most of the evolution of the bubble proceeds
within the applicability of the thin wall approximation. via standard quasi-
classical consideration this assumes that the wave function of the bubble
decays quickly near zero radius so this region should not be essential.

the oscillatory motion of the bubbles can be quantized and the discrete

energy levels found by applying the bohr - sommereld quantization rule:

i(e)  i p dr  2 (e) = 2 n ,

(3)

where the integral runs over one full period of oscillation and contains the
momentum p determined by eq.(2) in the thin wall approximation. the
quantity (e) is a correction to the thin wall limit, which arises from the
contribution to the action of the motion at short distances r  , where the
latter limit is not applicable. since at such distances p  e, by order of
magnitude (e) can be estimated as (e)  e. the integral in eq.(3) is
of the order of e r0, and is thus much larger than (e) once the condition
r0   is satised. in terms of the turning radius r0 the quantization relation
(3) reads as

en = 1/3 (2 n/k)2/3 .

thus for nite n the energy of the bubble scales as n 1/3

let us rst verify that the thin wall approximation is valid. using the
fact that the tension of the wall scales as nc, one sees from eq.(4) that (at
nite n)

which is indeed large compared to the wall width,   1/nc (on the other
side, r0 is small compared to the scale of the theory, , so the bubbles are
point-like).

let us now estimate the decay rate of the quantum bubble into the light
glueballs (whose mass is independent of nc in the multicolor limit). the
spectrum of the particles produced by an accelerating wall is described by
the exponential ee/tef f , where e is the energy of the produced particles and
tef f stands for an eective temperature, which is equal to the acceleration
of the wall. in the case of the bubble a typical acceleration is of the order of
1/r0. hence, in view of eq.(7), we expect that the particle production rate
is ecn

c where c is nc-independent.

it is seen from eq.(4) that for suciently high levels of the bubble, n 
nc, r0 becomes unsuppressed by the powers of nc and hence for such levels
one expects no suppression of the particle production. remarkably, energy
of these extremal levels scales as nc, which is the mass scale argued in [4]
to exist in n=1 supersymmetric multicolor gluodynamics in order to explain
the nc dependence of the domain wall width.

it is worth noticing that both perturbative and nonperturbative correc-
tions to the eective action eq.(1) are likely to be small. indeed, the eective
coupling constant is expected to freeze at the scale r0 which is small com-
pared to 1/. so, perturbative corrections are expected to be of the order of
1/lognc. nonperturbative corrections should be suppressed by powers of nc.
one is tempted to claim that in the multicolor limit eq.(6) is nonexact only
because it is obtained via bohr-sommereld quantization, which is good only
for suciently high levels. notice, however, that eq.(6) gives only part of the
spectrum, nonspherical modes of the bubble being neglected. the problem
of quantization of the bubble in general case is the problem of quantization
of supermembrane which is unsolved by now.

all of the above picture is very likely to exist in the usual non-supersymmetric

gluodynamics in the multicolor limit. in [10] (see also [11], [12]) it was argued
that even in the non-supersymmetric case at every  where are nc vacua one
of which being stable and others - metastable. however those metastable

4

vacua live innitely long in the multicolor limit. the wall interpolating be-
tween the adjacent vacua was argued to have the same nc-dependences - nc
in its tension and 1/nc in its width. of course, the walls between nonde-
generate vacua cannot be at rest, but the quantum bubbles can still exist.
a typical size of the quantum bubbles is seen to be much less than the size
of the critical bubble (the one which arise in the spontaneous metastable
vacuum decay), hence the above estimates remain intact.

let us briey discuss possible interactions of quantum bubbles in minkowski

space. first we have to pose question about the bubble charges. it is clear
that at domain wall is charged with respect to three-form eld which can be
identied in non-supersymmetric case with chern-simons three-form. how-
ever the total charge of the bubble vanishes. the most simple argument
concerning this point amounts from the analogy with the behaviour of one-
form eld in two dimensions. indeed in d=2 electric eld of the charge is
constant and the total eld of charge-anticharge pair is zero. the bubble
above is the analogue of this pair in d=4 and taking into account that the
curvature of the three-form eld of the wall is constant one can show the
absence of the total three-form charge.

therefore there is no the coulomb like interaction between two bubbles.
however one can look for the possible string like interaction for the bubble
pair. naively one can expect a string stretched between bubbles since qcd
string can end on the domain wall. but more careful inspection shows that
it is not the case. the point is that u(1) eld providing this possibility is
related to the presence of the fermionic zero mode on the at domain wall.
in the bubble case zero mode disappears due to the curvature therefore the
argument above fails in this case. thus there is no interaction of the bubble
pair via a single qcd string. on more supporting argument comes from the
consideration of the sizes of the objects - the size of qcd string is believed
to be independent of nc while the size of the low level bubble vanishes in the
multicolor limit. the issue of other possibilities for the bubbles to interact
deserves further investigation.

it would be interesting to realize the inuence of these additional states
on the thermodynamics of the multicolor qcd. the fractional dependence
on n implies the possibility of a kind of the phase transition related with the
quantum bubbles. since we deal with the large n limit one can also expect
gravitational counterpart of these states via ads/cft correspondence.
