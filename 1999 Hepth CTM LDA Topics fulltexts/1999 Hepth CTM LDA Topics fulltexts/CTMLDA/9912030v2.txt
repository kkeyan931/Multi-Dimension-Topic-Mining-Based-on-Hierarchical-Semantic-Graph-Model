abstract

we discuss some properties of an m-9-brane in massive 11d theory proposed by

bergshoe, lozano and ortin. a 10-form gauge potential is consistently introduced into

the massive 11d supergravity, and an m-9-brane wess-zumino action is constructed as

that of a gauged -model. using duality relations is crucial in deriving the action, which

we learn from the study of a 9-form potential in 10d massive iia theory. a target space

solution of an m-9-brane with a non-vanishing 10-form gauge eld is also obtained, whose

source is shown to be the m-9-brane eective action.

1 introduction

m-theory is conjectured to be the strong coupling limit of the 10 dimensional (10d) type
iia string theory, and the 10d type iia string theory is to be the s1 compactied m-theory
in the vanishing limit of the radius[1]. so, based on this conjecture, the 10d type iia

theory and all of its constituents should have their 11-dimensional (11d) origins[2][1]. as

is well known, however, the 11d origin of 10d massive iia theory has not been understood

yet. (the 10d massive iia theory refers to the 10d iia string theory with a nonzero rr

10-form eld strength[3] and its eld theory limit, 10d massive iia supergravity[4][5].)

this is due to the fact that the massive iia supergravity has a cosmological term composed

of a mass parameter m. since there is the no-go theorem that 11d supergravity forbids

a cosmological term[6], the term (and hence the mass) cannot be derived from the 11d

supergravity via dimensional reduction. the mass is the dual of the eld strength of a

rr 9-form potential to which a d-8-brane couples. so, the 11d origin of the d-8-brane is

also unclear, although it is conjectured to be an m-9-brane from studies of the m-theory

superalgebra[7][8] (see also ref.[5]). some attempts have been made[9][10][11][12], and one

of them is massive 11-dimensional (11d) theory proposed by bergshoe, lozano, and

ortin[10][11]. we investigate this massive theory in this paper.

first, we give a brief review of the massive 11d theory. in this theory, target-space

elds are required to have a killing isometry (whose direction is parameterized by z).

its eld theory, called massive 11d supergravity[10], gives the bosonic part of the 10d

massive iia one upon dimensional reduction in z. though this is a bosonic theory, it is

called supergravity since it reproduces the bosonic part of the ordinary 11d supergravity

in the massless limit (and if the dependence of the elds on z is restored). target-

space solutions of m-9-branes are also obtained[13], which give d-8-brane solutions[14][5]

when dimensionally reduced over z.

in addition, worldvolume actions of m-branes in

this supergravity background have also been examined. in the cases of an m-wave, an

m-2-brane, an m-5-brane and an m-kaluza-klein monopole, full worldvolume actions

are obtained as those of gauged sigma models[10][11]. these actions also give those

of the 10d massive iia branes suggested by the 10d iia superalgebra upon direct or
double dimensional reduction.
(wz) action has not been constructed yet, although a kinetic term of the action has been
constructed [13][15].

in the case of an m-9-brane, however, a wess-zumino

 furthermore, actions of branes not predicted by the iia superalgebra are also obtained[15][16].
 it is considered that an m-9-brane cannot be singled out in 11 uncompactied dimensions, but it can
be singled out when there is one compact dimension[17]. based on the discussion on how the m-9-brane
tension scales with the radius of the 11th compact dimension[13], the action in this approach describes

2

the main purpose of this paper is to construct the wz action of an m-9-brane in a

massive 11d supergravity background, since wz actions of branes also play important

roles in investigating properties of branes and dualities (e.g. see the recent paper [18]).

for this purpose, a 10-form gauge potential is needed[7] since a p-brane naturally couples

to the (p+1)-form potential. so, specically, we introduce the 10-form potential into the

massive 11d supergravity and construct the m-9-brane wz action by using the 10-form.

in introducing a 10-form potential, we follow the case of a 9-form gauge potential in

the 10d massive iia supergravity. there are two methods to introduce the 9-form: the

rst one is to promote the mass parameter m to a scalar eld m(x) and to introduce a

9-form potential as a lagrange multiplier for the constraint dm(x) = 0[5]. (we denote
this 9-form as a(9).) the second one is superspace formulation where the basis of the eld
variables of rr (p+1)-form is inspired by the coupling to d-p-branes[19][20]. in this case
the gauge transformations and the eld strengths of dual rr gauge elds are suggested

on the basis that the rr gauge elds can be dealt with in a geometrically uniform way,

and their consistency is checked by discussing t-dualities[20]. the eld strength of the

9-form potential is dened as a dual of the mass parameter m. (we denote this 9-form as
c (9).) in this paper we choose the rst one to introduce a 10-form potential into the 11d
theory. the reason for this choice is as follows: in the rst method the massive gauge

transformation of the 10-form potential is automatically determined. on the other hand,

if one applies the second method to the 11d case, one have to construct by hand a massive

gauge transformation and a eld strength of the 10-form consistently, which seems dicult

since there is no geometric uniformity or t-duality symmetry in the massive 11d case.

however, an gauge invariant m-9-brane wz action cannot be constructed by using the

10-form at least straightforwardly. in fact this is also the case with the d-8-brane wz
action sw z
d8 and the 9-form a(9) in 10d iia theory, where the 9-form used to construct
is c (9). (that is, the eld redenition relating the two 9-forms has not been found.)
sw z
d8
so, rst of all, we explore the way to construct sw z
in terms of a(9). as a result, we
d8
show that a gauge invariant d-8-brane wz action can be constructed in terms of a(9) if
duality relations are appropriately used (to be concrete, for rewriting the expression of
the massive gauge transformation of a(9)). so, based on this lesson, we repeat the same
procedures in the massive 11d theory: we discuss eld strengths of gauge elds and their

duals and assume their duality relations, based on their transformations properties and

their relations to 10d iia elds. then, we use the relations appropriately to rewrite the

an m-9-brane wrapped around the compact isometry direction.

 the requirement of -symmetry of the d-brane actions is shown to imply the eld equations of

massive iia supergravity[21][22].

detailed discussions are given in section 2.

massive gauge transformation of a(10). finally, we construct a gauge invariant m-9-brane
wz action which gives the d-8-brane wz action on dimensional reduction along z.

moreover, this paper has another purpose: to reconstruct the target-space solution of

a single m-9-brane given in ref.[13]. two points are improved: the rst one is that we

solve the equations of motion (of the massive 11d supergravity) with the source terms,

which comes from the obtained wz action as well as the kinetic action of an m-9-brane.

the source terms have not been taken into account in ref.[13], but they must be considered

since an m-9-brane can be regarded roughly as an electric object in terms of the 10-form

gauge eld. the second one is that we construct an m-9-brane solution with a nontrivial

conguration of 10-form potential. the solutions in ref.[13] are obtained as solutions of

a pure gravity (i.e. only the metric eld is nontrivial). however, this seems unnatural

because usual p-brane solutions are obtained as those with nontrivial (p+1)-form gauge

potentials. to be concrete, we make a certain ansatz, including the one done in ref.[13],

and solve the equations of motion with the source terms.

the organization of this paper is as follows: in section 2 we discuss the case of the

9-form in 10d massive iia supergravity. we rst give a review of it, and then exhibit the

problem and its resolution stated above explicitly. in section 3, after a short review of

the massive 11d supergravity, we introduce a 10-form gauge potential. then, we discuss

duality relations, use them appropriately and construct an m-9-brane wz action.

in

section 4 we solve the equations of motion with source terms and present an m-9-brane

solution with a nontrivial 10-form potential.

in section 5 we give short summary and

discussion. in the appendix, we give the relations between the 11d and the 10d elds.

2 a 9-form potential in 10d massive iia theory

in this section we begin with a brief review of the 10d massive iia supergravity[4][5]. it
has the same eld content as the massless one: {g, b, , c (1)
}.k the (innitesi-
mal) massive gauge transformations are dened as

 , c (3)

b = 2[], c (1)

 = m, c (3)

 = 3mb[]

(2.1)

where  is a 1-form gauge parameter and m is a constant mass parameter. the gauge
invariant eld strengths of them are

h (3)

g(2)

 = 2[c (1)

] + mb,
]  12[bc (1)

g(4)

are 11-dimensional, and those with no hats are 10 dimensional.

(2.3)

where  is the totally antisymmetric symbol (0129 = 1). the bosonic action of the 10d
massless iia supergravity can be found by taking the limit m  0.

one way to introduce a 9-form gauge potential is to promote the mass parameter m

to a scalar eld m(x), and to add the term

to the action s0[5]. then, the eld equation of a(9) implies that the scalar eld m(x) is a
constant m, so, eliminating a(9) leads to the eld equations of the original massive iia
supergravity. after the above procedure, the m(x) eld equation is

implying that the 10-form eld strength f (10) = 10a(9) is regarded as the variable
canonically conjugate to m.

at this moment, the original action s0 is no longer invariant under the transformations

(2.1). instead, s0 is proportional to m, as

(2.6)

this variation can be cancelled (up to total derivative) by dening such a variation of the
9-form gauge potential a(9) as

(2.7)

as discussed in ref.[13], the sign of the cosmological constant is determined by t-duality.
 strictly speaking, m (x) is piecewise constant. we discuss this point in section 4.

5

so, it is concluded that the 9-form potential is introduced consistently. we note that
the rst two terms of (2.7) cannot be expressed as exterior products of forms.

now, we discuss the construction of the d-8-brane wz action sw z

d8 . what we want
d8 by using the 9-form a(9). however, this cannot be achieved at
to do is to construct sw z
least straightforwardly. to be concrete, since a d-8-brane couples to a 9-form potential,
sw z

d8 contains the term

sw z

d8 |9form part =

t

9!z d9 i1i9i1x 1    i9x 9a(9)

19

(2.8)

where i (i = 0, .., 8) are worldvolume coordinates of the brane and x  ( = 0, .., 9) are
embedding coordinates. suppose we consider the massive gauge transformation of (2.8).

then, we can see that the contribution of the rst two terms of (2.7) to the variation of
d8 |9form part cannot be cancelled even if any other terms are added to sw z
sw z
d8 |9form part.
this implies that one cannot keep the massive gauge symmetry of the brane action if a(9)
is used straightforwardly.

our idea to resolve this problem is very simple: if one rewrite the rst two terms of
(2.7) by using the dual elds of c (1) and c (3) through duality relations, the two terms
can be expressed as a sum of exterior products of forms. so, it is expected that a gauge

invariant wz action can be constructed.

this idea is a success, which we show in the following: the dual elds of c (3) and c (1)
is the 5-form c (5) and the 7-form c (7), respectively. we use the duals dened in ref.[20],
whose eld strengths and massive gauge transformations are given respectively as

( g(6)

g(8)

16 = (6c (5)  60bc (3) + 15mb3)[16],
18 = (8c (7)  168bc (5) + 105mb4)[18],

( c (5)

c (7)

15 = 15(b2)[15],
17 = 105(b3)[17].

the duality relations of them (in our notation) are[20]

g(2)12 =

8!q|g|

g(8)

310, g(4)14 =

(2.9)

substituting these relations for the rst two terms of (2.7) leads to the rewritten expression

b4][19].(2.10)

using this expression, we can obtain the wz action invariant under the massive gauge
transformations. this means that via a eld redenition, a(9) is related to the 9-form
potential c (9) which is usually used for constructing sw z
d8 . so, instead of giving the action
 after the procedure, the eld strengths of rr gauge elds are also not invariant under the massive
gauge transformations due to the promotion of m to m (x). however, this causes no problem because
one can replace at any time m (x) for a constant m by solving the a(9) eld equation.

6

in terms of a(9), we present the redenition relation. the eld strength of c (9) is dened
in this case as[20]

 m = g(10) =

10!q|g|

10[c (9)  36bc (7) +

189m

2

b5]110.

(2.11)

substituting (2.9) for the last two terms of (2.5) and comparing it with (2.11), we can

determine the relation between the two 9-forms up to total derivative as

c (9)

19 = {a(9) + 9!(

2  7!

c (7)b

23  5!

c (5)b2 +

23(3!)2 c (3)b3)}[19].

(2.12)

this redenition relation is consistent with the massive gauge transformations of the two,
(i.e. (2.10) and c (9)
d8 can be constructed via a(9).
thus, we conclude that using duality relations are crucial to derive the the wz action in
terms of the 9-form a(9).

19 = 945m(b4)[19]). so, sw z

3 a 10-form gauge potential and an m-9-brane wess-

zumino action in massive 11d supergravity

in this section we rst review the massive 11d supergravity[10]. the bosonic eld content

of the supergravity is the same as that of the usual (massless) 11d supergravity: the metric
g and a 3-form gauge potential c. in this theory these elds are required to have
c = 0 where lk indicates a lie derivative with
a killing isometry, i.e., lkg = lk
respect to a killing vector eld k. (we take the coordinates so that k = z.) the
innitesimal gauge transformations of the elds are dened as

g = m[(ik g) + (ikg)],  c = 3[ ]  3m[(ik

where (ikt (r)
1r1 for a eld t (r).  is the innitesimal 2-form gauge
parameter, and  is dened as   (ik ). then, a connection for the massive gauge
transformations should be considered. the new total connection takes the form  bc

the 4-form eld strength g(4) of c is dened as

(3.5)

now, let us introduce a 10-form gauge potential a(10). following the case of the 9-form

in fact, the 10d action (2.3) is obtained from this action only if the surface terms are omitted. omitting
them, we use this action as a starting action, in order to make the correspondence of the 11d theory
with the 10d one.

next, we prepare to rewrite the rst two terms of the massive transformation (3.7), in
the same way as the 10d case. the dual eld of the 3-form c is the 6-form c (6) whose
massive gauge transformation, eld strength and the duality relation are[10]

in this paper we regard k  (ikg) as a vector gauge eld, and consider the eld

g(2)

  2[k]  m |k|2(ik

c),

(3.13)

g(2) is shown to transform covariantly under (3.1). so, g(2), in fact arising in the rst
term of (3.7), can be interpreted as the eld strength of k. on the other hand, the eld
strength g(9) of the full 8-form n (8) is dicult to construct. however, in order to rewrite
the rst term through the duality relation between g(9) and g(2), it is sucient to know
n (8)). this is because g(2) in the rst term of (3.8) vanishes if
the eld strength of (ik
any of the indices of g(2) takes z, implying that one of the indices of g(9) certainly takes
z. thus, only the eld strength of (ik

we concentrate our discussions on the gauge transformations with respect to  and .

since all the preparations have been done, let us substitute the relation (3.11) and

(3.15) for (3.7) to have the rewritten expression of the massive gauge transformation of

since the right hand side of (3.17) is shown to be gauge invariant, it can be interpreted

conclude that the 10-form a(10) is introduced consistently. moreover, we dene a new

then, the gauge transformation of c (10) takes the simple form:

(ik

c (10))19 = 945{4(ik

c)3 + m (ik

c)4 }[19].

(3.18)

(3.19)

for convenience, we use this 10-form to construct sw z
m9 .

finally, we construct the m-9-brane wz action as that of the gauged -model, in which
the translation along k is gauged[23][10][11]. in this approach the m-9-brane wrapped
around the compact isometry direction is described[13]. so, denoting its worldvolume
coordinates by i (i = 0, 1, .., 8) and their embeddings by x ()( = 0, 1, .., 9, z), the
worldvolume gauge transformation is given by

x  = ()k

(3.20)

where () is a scalar gauge parameter. in order to make the brane action invariant under
the transformation, the derivative of x  with respect to i is replaced by the covariant
derivative[11]

dix  = ix   aik

(3.21)

10

with the gauge eld ai = |k|2ix  k. the dimensional reduction of dix  is such
that dix  = ix  for  6= z and dix z = ix c (1)
 . (ix z = 0 since x z corresponds
to z.) the m-9-brane action must be so constructed as to give the d-8-brane action on

dimensional reduction along z. so, considering the eld relations given in the appendix,
we obtain the m-9-brane wz action for a constant mass background m (x) = m:

4 a target-space m-9-brane solution

in this section we obtain an m-9-brane solution with a nontrivial 10-form, by solving the
equations of motion with the source terms (i.e. stotal  {smassive sugra + sm 9} = 0).

we set the ansatz for the target-space elds:

ds2 = h (dt2  dx2

(8))  h dy2  h dz2

a(10)

01,..,8z = a(10)

01,..,8z(y)

with all the other elds vanishing, and for the worldvolume elds:

x i = i

for i = 0, 1, .., 8,

and bj = 0.

(4.1)

(4.2)

h is a function depending on the single transverse direction y. then, the nontrivial
equations of motion are only those for g, a(10), m , and x i.

11

suppose the single m-9-brane we consider lies at y = 0. then, the a(10) equation is

y m = tm9(y),

 m = 0 for  6= y

(4.3)

where 1/ r dxz/. if, for simplicity, we take the symmetry between the region y > 0

and y < 0 into account, it is proper to take the solution

m (x) =(  m

m

for y > 0
for y < 0

where m  tm9/2. in other words, the mass parameter is determined by the background
m-9-brane as the above. then, the einstein equation parts of the eld equations of g are
the same as those before introducing the 10-form. so, we have  = /3,  = 10/3  2

and  = 5/3 for a nonzero parameter , as given in ref.[13]. then, the eld equations of
g are

so, a solution to these equations is obtained as

(4.7)

for an arbitrary nonzero  and a constant c. we note that h is a harmonic function on y.

we also note that if one require h to be positive in order to avoid a singularity at h = 0,

one must take c to be positive and  to be negative.

the remaining target-space eld equation is that of m, which in this case is

(4.8)

this equation determines (the eld strength of) a(10). it is solved by

a(10)

018z = h .

(4.9)

then, x  eld equations are satised. thus, we can obtain the m-9-solution with a non-
trivial 10-form by solving the equations of motion with the source terms. the dimensional

reduction of the solution along z gives the d-8-brane solution[5][13].

 we note that because of the existence of the isometry direction, l(x)

l(x) = (10)(x  x) for a eld l,
instead of (11)(x  x). moreover, the integration with respect to xz = z in the supergravity action is
performed at the beginning.

5 summary and discussion

we have constructed the wess-zumino action of a single m-9-brane wrapped around the

compact direction. we have also obtained the m-9-solution with a nontrivial conguration

of the 10-form by solving the equations of motion with the source terms. this implies

the consistency of the m-9-brane action, not only the wz term obtained in this paper
but also the scaling factor |k|3 of the m-9-brane kinetic action [13][15] (to be concrete,
see (4.6)). another consistency check can be done by considering a test m-9-brane in

an m-9-brane background. the static potential v of the test m-9-brane is obtained by

substituting the m-9-brane solution obtained in section 4 for the target-space elds of the

m-9-brane eective action, as done in ref.[24]. then, putting the test brane parallel to
the background m-9-brane with an orientation, we have the potential v = h   h  = 0.
this implies that the test brane is stable, which is a reasonable result. so, we conclude

that the introduction of the 10-form and the construction of the m-9-brane wz action is

achieved in a consistent way.

furthermore, as discussed in ref.[25][26][15][17][16], there are other possibilities of di-

mensional reduction: the m-9-brane dimensionally reduced along the worldvolume direc-

tion but not the isometry direction is supposed to give an 8-brane with a gauged direction,

called a kk-8a brane[26][15]. on the other hand, the m-9-brane dimensionally reduced

along the transverse direction is to give an 9-brane called an ns-9a brane[25][17]. the

worldvolume actions of the former is given fully in ref.[16] and that of the latter is pre-

sented in ref.[17], but both are obtained via dualities. so, deriving these actions via

dimensional reduction from the m-9-brane action, including the wz part obtained in this

paper, will reinforce the consistency of the action. this appears to be possible, but we

do not discuss this further here.

appendix
in this appendix we present the relations between the 11d and the 10d elds via

dimensional reduction in the isometry direction[10]. (hats on indices indicate that they

are 11-dimensional, and absence of hats indicates that they are 10-dimensional.) the

elfbein basis is

parameter, while and z   to . we note that 110z = 110, but 110z =
