abstract

the foundations of time asymmetric quantum theory are reviewed and are
applied to the construction of relativistic gamow vectors. relativistic gamow
vectors are obtained from the resonance pole of the s-matrix and furnish an
irreducible representation of the poincare semigroup. they have all the prop-
erties needed to represent relativistic quasistable particles and can be used to
x the denition of mass and width of relativistic resonances like the z-boson.
most remarkably, they have only a semigroup time evolution into the forward
light coneexpressing time asymmetry on the microphysical level.

1 time asymmetric quantum mechanics

in classical physics one has time symmetric dynamical equations with time asymmet-
ric boundary conditions [1, 2]. these time asymmetric boundary conditions come in
pairs: given one time asymmetric boundary condition, its time reversed boundary
condition can also be formulated mathematically. for example in classical electro-
dynamics one has retarded and advanced solutions of the time symmetric dynamical
(maxwell) equations or in general relativity one has time asymmetric big bang and

big crunch solutions of einsteins time symmetric equation. except for a few promi-
nent cases of pedagogical importance (e.g. stationary states or cyclic evolutions), the
physics of our world is predominantly time-asymmetric. somehow nature chooses one
of the pair of time asymmetric boundary conditions.

the standard quantum mechanics in hilbert space [3] does not allow time asym-
metric boundary conditions for the schrodinger or von neumann equation [4]. how-
ever this is a consequence of the mathematical properties of the hilbert space and need
not imply that quantum physics is strictly time symmetric. it would be incredible if
classical electrodynamics had a radiation arrow of time and quantum electrodynamics
did not also have an arrow of time.

in quantum physics peierls and siegert considered many years ago time asymmet-
ric solutions with purely outgoing boundary conditions [5]. the choice of appropriate
dense subspaces + and  of the (complete) hilbert space h allows the formulation
of time asymmetric boundary conditions:

+  h for the out-states {} of scattering theory
which are actually observables as dened by
the registration apparatus (detector), and

  h for the in-states {+} which are prepared
states as dened by the preparation appara-
tus (accelerator).

time asymmetric quantum theory distinguishes meticulously between states {+}
and observables {}. two dierent dense subspaces of the hilbert space h are
chosen,  = {+} and + = {}. the standard hilbert space quantum theory
uses h for both, {} = {+} = h and as a result is time symmetric with a reversible
unitary group time evolution.
in the theory of scattering and decay, a pair of time asymmetric boundary condi-
tions can be heuristically implemented by choosing in- and out-plane wave states
|e +i and |ei which are solutions of the lippmann-schwinger equation [6]

tion |ei are in our time asymmetric quantum theory [7] antilinear functionals on
the spaces , i.e. they are elements of the dual space |ei  
.
this leads to two rigged hilbert spaces (rhs) and the following new hypothesis
for time asymmetric quantum theory2:

pure registered observables or so-called
out-states are described by the vectors

by the vectors

in addition to the dirac lippmann-schwinger kets |ei  

this new hypothesiswith the appropriate choice for the spaces + and  given
below in (4)is essentially all by which our time asymmetric quantum theory diers
from the standard hilbert space quantum mechanics which imposes {} = {+} =
h (or {} = {+}  h).
, the dual spaces 

of the rhss also contain gamow kets |er  ir/2i  
, which are generalized
eigenvectors of the (self-adjoint) hamiltonian with complex eigenvalue (er  ir/2).
we use these gamow kets to describe quasistable particles.
we shall now mathematically dene + and , and therewith the rhss (3).
from a mathematical formulation of causality expressed by the truism a state must
be prepared before an observable can be measured (registered) in it, one can argue
that the energy wave functions he|i are the boundary values of analytic functions
in the upper half energy plane (second sheet of the s-matrix) and the h+e|+i are
the same for the lower half plane [8]. precisely,

where s is the schwartz space and s  h2
 are well-behaved hardy functions in the
lower (upper) half plane c of the second riemann sheet for the s-matrix s(e). the
disparity between the labels  for the vectors and the spaces (e.g. +  ) now
makes sense. the superscripts of the vectors is the standard notation of scattering
theory while the subscripts of the spaces comes from their mathematical denition
(4). this correspondence (4) between the physical state vectors and the mathematical
spaces is a wonderful example of what wigner calls the unreasonalbe eectiveness
of mathematics in the natural sciences [9].

(hf|en) = en(f|en) for all f   dense in h.

quantum mechanical resonances are most commonly dened by the pair of resonance
poles in the second riemann sheet of the analytically continued s-matrix at the po-
sition er  ir/2; a decaying state is associated to the pole at zr = er  ir/2.
vector representations of quasistable particles like the k 0 mesons in the lee-oehme-
yang theory [10] use approximate methods such as the weisskopf-wigner approxi-
mation [11] for which there does not exist...a rigorous theory to which these various
methods can be considered approximations [12].

often one hears the opinion that resonances and decaying states are complicated
objects and cannot be represented by simple (exponentially decaying) state vectors.
this opinion diers from the common practice to classify quasistable particles along
with stable particles [13] and also contradicts empirical facts: quasistable particles are
not qualitatively dierent from stable particles but only quantitatively by a non-zero
value of the width  which one takes to be the inverse lifetime,  = / . stability
or the value of the lifetime is not a criterion for elementarity. a particle decays if it
can and remains stable if selection rules for some quantum numbers prevents it from
decaying.

stable and quasistable states should be described on the same footing, e.g. both
dened by a pole of the s-matrix at the position en for stable particles and at the
position zr = er  ir/2 for quasistable particles. then in analogy to the vector
description (5) for stable particles, there should also be a description of a quasistable
particle by a generalized eigenvector with eigenvalue zr. a vector description is also
needed to express the initial decay rate by the golden rule as in [10]. therefore, in
analogy to (5) resonances and quasistable particles will be described as generalized
eigenvectors of the self-adjoint hamiltonian with complex eigenvalue (er  ir/2),
where er represents the resonance energy and /r is the lifetime:

where the only distinction from (5) is that h|zr

to obtain this vector representation of quasistable states one starts with the s-

+ gamow vectors.

and analytically continues the integral to the resonance pole zr = er  i/2 of the
s-matrix hb|s(z)|bi [8] as shown in fig. 1. for this to be possible, the set of in-states
{+}   and out-states {}  + must have certain analyticity properties. in
order to get a breit-wigner energy distribution for the pole term of (7), the energy
wave functions he|i and h+e|+i must be well-behaved hardy class functions of
the upper and lower half plane, respectively, in the second sheet of the energy surface
of the s-matrix. this is the same mathematical condition as provided by causality
and stated by (4).

scribed by , p(t) = tr(|gihg|), can be calculated as a function of time

tiation. this leads to an exact golden rule (with the natural lineshape given
by a breit-wigner) which in the born approximation (g  f d; r/er  0;
er  e0, where fd is an eigenvector of h0 = h  v with eigenvalue e0) goes
into fermis golden rule no. 2 of dirac.

3 relativistic resonances,

relativistic gamow kets and
poincare semigroup representations

stable relativistic particles are dened and described by unitary irreducible represen-
tations h(s, j) of the poincare group p [14] where s is the eigenvalue of p p and j is
the spin. in the irreducible representation space one commonly uses the wigner basis
vectors |p, j3; (s, j)i, but one could just as well use any other complete basis system,
e.g. the 4-velocity basis |p, j3; (s, j)i where p = p/s and |p, j3i = u(l(p))|0, j3i
with

stable relativistic particles are characterized in addition to the charge quantum
numbers or particle labels by the value of mass m and spin j. they are therefore
described by the vectors +(s = m2, j) or (s = m2, j) of the unitary irreducible
representation spaces (11). they lead to poles of the jth partial s-matrix sj(s) at
the value s = m2 on the real axis of the rst sheet [15].

decaying states or resonances are dened by poles of the jth partial s-matrix

sj(s) on the second sheet at

s = sr  (mr  i

quasistable relativistic particles are thus characterized by wr  sr = mr 

ir/2 and by spin jr, where we call the resonance mass mr and the resonance width
r for reason seen below in (19). more common is to call m and  of (13a) the
resonance mass and width [13]. some examples are:

1. relativistic hadron resonances such as the  meson in e+e    + with

(/m)  101.

2. relativistic (weakly) decaying states such as k 0

s  + with (/m)  1015.

3. the z-bosons in e+e  z  + with (/m)  102.
for these resonance scattering and decay processes one uses in the s-matrix el-
ements (7), the relativistic dirac lippmann-schwinger scattering states |e, bi =
|p, j3; (s, j)i for physical values of s, or in other words for values of s with
(m1 + m2 +    mn)2  s < . to obtain the relativistic gamow kets one ana-
lytically continues these relativistic dirac lippmann-schwinger kets in the contour
deformation for the integral of (7) in the following way: the real s = p2 = (p1 + p2)2
becomes a complex s but the p = p/s remain real. at the pole position s = sr
one obtains the relativistic gamow kets:

|p, j3; (sr, j)i =

i

ds |p, j3; (s, j)i

(14)

these gamow kets are basis vectors of a minimally complex semigroup representa-
tion of p which is characterized by (sr, j). this is the analogy of the representation

for non-relativistic gamow vectors [8]:

(15)

the relativistic gamow vectors have according to (14) a relativistic breit-wigner
s-distribution given by (s  (mr  i/2)2)1. they can be shown to be generalized
eigenvectors of the invariant mass-squared operator m 2 = pp  [16], i.e. they fulll

(17)

however the space-time translations can no more be represented by a group of oper-
ators u(a, 1) in

+  h(sr, j)  +.

(18)

the rigged hilbert spaces of hardy class have to be employed in rigorously obtaining
(14) and (16) and then one can see that only the semigroup of space-time translations
into the forward light cone can be represented in the space (18). much like in the rhs
theory of non-relativistic gamow vectors, one can show that the time translation of
the decaying state in the rest frame p = 0 is given by

eiht|0, j3; (sr, j)i = eimrtert/2|0, j3; (sr, j)i, t  0 only,

(19)

where t is the time in the rest system.

thus, the relativistic gamow vectors have a semigroup time evolution and obey
the exponential law. from (19) it follows that the lifetime of the particle represented
by the relativistic gamow vector is given by r = /r where the width r is the
imsr given by the resonance pole position sr of the relativistic s-matrix. the
real resonance mass mr in (19) is the resr and therefore not exactly the same
as the peak position m  mrp1  1/4(r/mr)2 of the modulus of the relativistic

breit-wigner amplitude of (14).

4 summary

our fundamental assertion is that stable and unstable particles are not fundamentally
dierent. the theoretical treatment of stable and unstable particles should therefore
be the same. within the hilbert space (hs) quantum theory, time asymmetric bound-
ary conditions cannot be formulated and a theory of decaying states within the hs
framework can only be approximate [12]. within the rhs, time asymmetric quan-
tum theory can be introduced by the new hypothesis (3,4) which allows a distinction
between states and observables.

within this theory, gamow vectors, both relativistic and non-relativistic, satisfy
all necessary properties of representing quasi-stable states and resonances. they are
associated to poles of the s-matrix, have breit-wigner energy distribution and obey
an exponential semigroup time evolution. all of these properties can be formulated
mathematically precisely, and a particular property of the gamow vector is that it
relates the width r of the breit-wigner energy distribution and the lifetime  of
the exponential decay  = /r. without the gamow vectors, the width and inverse
lifetime only can be shown to be approximately equal by use of some approximate
method based on weisskopf-wigner [11]. consequently, one did not know whether
to choose (mr, r) or (m, ) of (13a) or any other (m, ) as the mass and width of
relativistic resonances.

the relativistic gamow vectors unify in a fundamental picture both stable and un-
stable relativistic particles. both are given by irreducible representations of poincare
transformations. stable particles are unitary representations characterized by a real
mass and have unitary group time evolution, quasi-stable particles are minimally
complex semigroup representations characterized by a complex mass and have semi-
group time evolution with an arrow of time.

that relativistic gamow states |zr

i possess only semigroup transformations into
the forward light cone (and that others possess only those into the backward light
cone) and no space-like translations (for either case) is a result whose interpretation
is not yet clear. it is the relativistic analogue of the semigroup time evolution in non-
relativistic quantum mechanics which can be understood as the causality condition
that a state must be rst prepared before an observable can be measured in it [7].
this time asymmetry on the microphysical levelirreversibility without entropy in-
crease and without violation of time reversal invariancewas the most surprising and
remarkable property of the non-relativistic and relativistic gamow vectors.
