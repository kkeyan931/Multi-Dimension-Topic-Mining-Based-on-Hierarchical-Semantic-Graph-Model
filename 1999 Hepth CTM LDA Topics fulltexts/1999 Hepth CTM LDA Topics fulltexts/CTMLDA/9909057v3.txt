abstract

a particular initial state for the construction of the perturbative expansion
of qcd is investigated. it is formed as a coherent superposition of zero mo-
mentum gluon pairs and shows lorentz as well as global su (3) symmetries.
it follows that the gluon and ghost propagators determined by it, coincides
with the ones used in an alternative of the usual perturbation theory proposed
in a previous work. therefore, the ability of such a procedure of producing a
nite gluon condensation parameter already in the rst orders of perturbation
theory is naturally explained. it also follows that this state satises the phys-
icality condition of the brst procedure in its kugo and ojima formulation.
the brst quantization is done for the value  = 1 of the gauge parameter
where the procedure is greatly simplied. therefore, after assuming that the
adiabatic connection of the interaction does not take out the state from the
interacting physical space, the predictions of the perturbation expansion, at
the value  = 1, for the physical quantities should have meaning. the validity
of this conclusion solves the gauge dependence indeterminacy remained in the
proposed perturbation expansion.

i. introduction.

quantum chromodynamics (qcd) was discovered in the seventies and up to this time
it is considered as the fundamental theory for the strong interactions, as a consequence it
has been deeply investigated [1].

in one limit, the smallness of the coupling constant at high momentum (asymptotic free-
dom) made possible the theoretical investigation of the so called hard processes by using the
familiar perturbative language. this so called perturbative qcd (pqcd) was satisfactorily
developed. however, relevant phenomena associated with the strong interactions cant be
described by the standard perturbative methods and the development of the so called non
perturbative qcd is at the moment one of the challenges of this theory.

one of the most peculiar characteristics of the strong interactions is color connement.
according to this philosophy, colored objects, like quarks and gluons, cant be observed as
free particles in contrast with hadrons which are colorless composite states and eectively
detected. the physical nature of such phenomenon remains unclear. numerous attempts to
explain this property have been made, for example explicit calculations in which the theory
is regularized on a spatial lattice [2], and also through the construction of phenomenological
models. in the so called mit bag model [3],it is assumed that a bag or a bubble is formed
around the objects having color in such a manner that they could not escape from it,
because their eective mass is smaller inside the bag volume and very high outside. within
the so called string model [4], which is based in the assumption that the interaction forces
between quarks and antiquarks grow when the distance increases, in such a way that the
energy increases linearly with the string length e(l) = kl.

a fundamental problem in qcd is the nature of the ground state [5]- [7]. this state is
imagined as a very dense state of matter, composed of gluons and quarks interacting in a
complicated way. its properties are not easily accessible in experiments, because quarks and
gluons elds can not be directly observed. furthermore, the interactions between quarks
cant be directly determined.

it is already accepted that in qcd the zero point oscillations of the coupled modes
produce a nite energy density which is determined phenomenologically. the numerical
estimate of it is

evac  fh0 | (gg)2 | 0i  0.5gev /f m3,

where the so called non perturbative gluonic condensate < 0|(gg)2 |0i was introduced and
phenomenologically evaluated by shifman, vainshtein and zakharov [8]. the negative sign
of evac means that the non perturbative vacuum energy is lower that the one associated to
the perturbative vacuum.

since a long time ago, one particular kind of models have shown to be able to predict
similar properties. these are the chromo-magnetic vacuum approaches, in which it is as-
sumed that a vacuum magnetic eld is existing at all the points [9]. concretely a constant
magnetic abelian eld h is assumed. a one loop calculation gives as the result the following
energy density

e (h) =

h 2

2  1 +

2

bg2

162 ln(cid:18) h

2(cid:19)! .

this formula predicts negative values for the energy at small elds, so the usual per-
turbative ground state with h = 0 is unstable with respect to the formation of a state
with a non vanishing eld intensity at which the energy e (h) has a minimum [9]. many
physical problems related with the hadron structure, connement problem, etc. have been
investigated using the savvidy model. nevertheless, after some time its intense study was
abandoned. the main reasons were: (1) the perturbative relation giving evac would only
be valid if the second order in the expansion in powers of the planck constant is relatively
small. (2) the specic spatial direction and the color direction of the magnetic eld break
the now seemingly indispensable lorentz and su(3) invariance of the ground state. (3) the
magnetic moment of the vector particle (gluon) is such that its energy in the presence of
the eld has a negative eigenvalue, which also makes the homogeneous magnetic eld h
unstable.

before presenting the objectives of the present work it should be stressed that the per-
turbative quantization of qcd is realized in the same way as that in qed. the quadratic
eld terms of the qcd lagrangian have the same form that the ones corresponding to the
electrons and photons in qed. however, in connection with the interaction, there appear a
substantial dierence due to the coupling of the gluon to itself. in addition is a general fact
that a perturbative expansion has some freedom in dependence on the initial conditions at
t   or what is the same, from the states in which the expansion is based. moreover,
as was expressed before, the exact ground state has a non trivial structure associated to a
gluon condensate.

then, given the above remarks, it is not unreasonable to expect that the true vacuum
state could be well described through a modied feynman expansion perturbatively describ-
ing a gluon condensate. such a perturbative condensate could generate all the low energy
physical observable which in the standard expansion could require an innite number of
terms of the series.

in a previous work of one of the authors (a.c.) [10], following the above idea, a modied
perturbation theory for qcd was proposed. this expansion retains the main invariance
of the theory (the lorentz and su(3) ones), and is also able to reproduce main physical
predictions of the chromomagnetic eld models. it seems possible to us that this procedure
could produce a reasonable if not good description of the low energy physics. if it is the
case, then, the low and high energy descriptions of qcd would be unied in a common
in particular in [10] the results had the interesting outcome of
perturbative framework.
producing a non vanishing mean value for the relevant quantity hg2i.
in addition the
eective potential for the condensation parameter in the rst order approximation shows a
minimum at non vanishing values of that parameter. therefore, the procedure is able to
reproduce at least some central predictions of the chromomagnetic models and general qcd
analysis.

the main objective of the present work consists in investigating the foundations of the
mentioned perturbation theory. the concrete aim is to nd a state in the focks space
of the non interacting theory being able to generate that expansion by also satisfying the
physicality condition of the brst quantization approach.

it follows that it is possible to nd the sought for state and it turns out to be an
exponential of a product of two gluon and ghost creation operators. that is, it can be
interpreted as a coherent superposition of states with many zero momentum gluon and

3

ghost pairs. therefore, this structure gives an explanation for the ability of the expansion
being investigated to produce non zero values of the gluon condensation in the rst orders
of perturbation theory. the fact that the eective action also shows a minimum for non
vanishing values of the condensation parameter also support the idea that the considered
state improves the perturbative expansion. it is also shown that the state satises the linear
condition which denes the physical subspace in the brst quantization for the  = 1 value
of the gauge parameter. thus, the indeniteness in the appropriate value of this parameter
to be used which remained in the former work is resolved opening the way for the study of
the predictions of the proposed expansion.

it should mentioned that a similar idea as the one advanced in [10] was afterwards con-
sidered in [11]. in that work, gluon and quark condensation in a range of momenta of the
order of qcd have been considered with the similar aim of constructing an alternative per-
turbative theory for qcd. however, in our view, that construction should break the lorentz
invariance because the condensates are expected to show a non-vanishing energy density. if
this limitation is not at work their proposed mechanism could be worth considering as an
alternative possibility.

the exposition will be organized as follows: in section 2, the brst operational quanti-
zation method for gauge elds developed by kugo and ojima is reviewed. starting from it,
in section 3 the ansatz for the focks space state which generates the wanted form of the
perturbative expansion is introduced. the proof that the state satises the physical state
condition is also given in this section. then, in section 4 it is shown that the proposed state
can generate the wanted modication of the propagator by a proper selection of the param-
eters at hand. the modication of the propagator for the ghost particles is also considered
in this section. finally the evaluation of the gluon condensation parameter done in [10]is
reviewed in order to illustrate the ability of the procedure in predicting a main property of
the real qcd ground state.

ii. review of the k-o quantization procedure

in the present section the operator formalism developed by t. kugo and i. ojima [12]-
[15] is reviewed and after specialized to the non interacting limit of gluodynamics (gd).
this formulation makes use of the invariance of the lagrangian under a global symmetry
operation called the brst transformation [16]. we will consider the construction of a
relativistic invariant initial state in the non-interacting limit of qcd. the brst physical
state condition in the non-interacting limit will be also imposed. as explained before, the
motivation is that we think that this state has the possibility to furnish the gluodynamics
ground state under the adiabatic connection of the interaction. in what follows we will work
in minkowski space with the conventions dened below.

let g a compact group and  any matrix in the adjoint representation of its associated

lie algebra. the matrix  can be represented as a linear combination of the form

where t a are the generators (a = 1, ..., dimg = n) which are chosen as hermitian ones,

and (9) is the lagrangian which describes the dynamics of the nonphysical faddeev-popov
ghost elds.

the physical state conditions in the brst procedure [17], [18] are given by

qb | i = 0,
qc | i = 0.

(11)
(12)

(13)

(14)

the brst charge is conserved as a consequence of the brst symmetry of the lagrangian

(6).the also conserved charge qc is given by

qc = iz d3xhca (x) 0ca (x) + gca (x) f abcab

0 (x) cc (x)i ,

(15)

which conservation comes from the noether theorem due to the invariance of lagrangian
(6) under the phase transformation c  ec, c  ec. this charge denes the so called
ghost number as the dierence between the number of c and c ghosts.
our interest will be centered here in the yang-mills theory without spontaneous breaking
of the gauge symmetry in the limit of no interaction. the quantization of the theory dened
by the lagrangian (6), after to be considered in the interaction free limit g  0, leads to
the following commutation relations for the free elds

 (x) , ab

 (y)i = ab (igd (x  y) + i (1  ) e (x  y)) ,

haa

 (x) , bb (y)i = ab (id (x  y)) ,
hba (x) , bb (y)i =nca (x) , cb (y)o =nca (x) , cb (y)o = 0,
nca (x) , cb (y)o = d (x  y) .

the equations of motion for the non-interacting elds takes the simple form

aa

 (x)  (1  ) ba (x) = 0,

aa

 (x) + ba (x) = 0,

ba (x) = ca (x) = ca (x) = 0.

(16)

(19)

this equations can be solved for arbitrary values of . however, as it was said before, the
discussion will be restricted to the case  = 1 which corresponds to the situation in which
all the gluon components satisfy the dalambert equation. this selection, as considered in
the framework of the usual perturbative expansion, implies that you are not able to check
the  independence of the physical quantities. however in the present discussion the aim is
to construct a perturbative state that satises the brst physicality condition, in order to
connect adiabatically the interaction. then, the physical character of all the prediction will
follow whenever the former assumption that adiabatic connection does not take the state
out of the physical subspace at any intermediate state is valid. clearly, the consideration
of dierent values of , would be also a convenient recourse for checking the  independent
perturbative expansion. however, at this stage it is preferred to delay the more technical
issue of implementing the brst quantization for any value of  for future work.

in that way the eld equations in the  = 1 gauge will be

aa

 (x) = 0,

aa

 (x) + ba (x) = 0,

ba (x) = ca (x) = ca (x) = 0.

the solutions of the set (20)-(22) can be written as

the above commutation rules and equations of motion dene the quantized non-
interacting limit of gd. it is possible now to start dening the alternative interaction free
ground state to be considered for the adiabatic connection of the interaction. as discussed
before, the expectation is that the physics of the perturbation theory being investigated is
able to furnish a helpful description of low energy physical eects.

iii. the alternative initial state

after beginning to work in the k.o. formalism some indications were found about that
the appropriate state vector obeying the physical condition in this procedure could have the
general structure

~p + ica+

~p ca+

~p (cid:17)(cid:17) | 0i (28)

where ~p is an auxiliary momentum, chosen as one of the few smallest values of the spatial
momentum for the quantized theory in a nite volume v . this value will be taken later in
the limit v   for recovering lorentz invariance. from here the sum on the color index
a will be explicit. the parameters ci (|~p|) will be xed below from the condition that the
free propagator associated to a state satisfying the brst physical state condition, coincides
with the one proposed in the previous work [10]. the solution of this problem, would then
give foundation to the physical implications of the discussion in that work.

it should also be noticed that the state dened by (28) have some similarity with coherent
states [19]. however, in the present case, the creation operators appear in squares. thus,
the argument of the exponential creates pairs of physical and non-physical particles. an
important property of this function is that its construction in terms of pairs of creation
operators determines that the mean value of an odd number of eld operator vanishes.
this is at variance with the standard coherent state, in that the mean values of the elds
are non zero. the vanishing of the mean eld is a property in common with the standard
perturbative vacuum, which lorentz invariance could be broken by any non-zero expectation
value of the 4-vector of the gauge eld. it should be also stressed that this state as formed
by the superposition of states of pair of gluons suggests a connection with some recent works
in the literature that consider the formation of gluons pairs due to color interactions.

let us argue below that the state (28) satises the brst physical conditions

the expression of the charges in the interaction free limit [17] are

qc | i = 0.

next, the evaluation of the norm of the proposed state is considered. due to the com-

mutation properties of the operators, it can be written as

finally the factor connected with the ghost elds can be evaluated to be

after substituting all the calculated factors, the norm of the state can be written as

n = h | i = y=1,2" xm=0|c (|~p|)|2m (2m)!

therefore, it is possible to dene the normalized state

(42)

(43)

(44)

(45)

note that, as should be expected, the norm is not dependent on the c3 (|~p|) parameter

which denes the non-physical particle operators entering in the denition of the state.

iv. gluon and ghost modified propagators.

let us consider the determination of the form of the main elements of perturbation
theory, that is the free particle propagators. it will be seen that the propagators associated
to the considered state has the same form as proposed in [11] under a proper selection of
the parameters. consider the generating functional of the free particle greens functions as
given by

as a consequence of the wicks theorem the generating functional can be written in the

after a systematic use of the commutation relations among the annihilation and creation
operators, the exponential operators can be decomposed in products of exponential for each
space-time mode. this fact allows us to perform the calculation for each kind of wave
independently. considering rst the transverse components is obtained

where the parts of the expression associated to each space-time mode are also decoupled.

in evaluating these matrix elements the idea was the following. first to expand the
exponents of the exponential operators being at the left of the scalar products in (55) by
factorizing the exponential operator having an exponent being linear in the sources j.
after that, taking into account that the inverse of this linear operator is annihilating the
vacuum, it follows that the net eect of this linear operator is to shift the creation elds
entering in the exponential operators at the right of the scalar products in (55) in a constant
being linear in the sources j. further, the same procedure can be performed to act
with the exponential factor which can be also extracted from the new exponential operator
acting on the vacuum at the right. now its action on the operators at the left of the scale
product (55) reduces again to a shift in a constant in the annihilation elds dening this
operator. in such a way it is possible to arrive to a recurrence relation which can be proven
by mathematical induction.

the recurrence relation obtained after n steps in the case of the transverse modes takes

the form

after restricting the possible values of c to satisfy |c (|~p|)| < 1

operators in the exponent is multiplied by a quantity tending to zero in the limit n =

the following expression can be obtained for (56)

therefore, after collecting the contributions of all the modes and substituting j a

p,i, by
also assuming 2c1 (|~p|) = 2c2 (|~p|) = c3 (|~p|) (which follows necessarily in order to obtain
lorentz invariance) and using the properties of the dened vectors basis, the modication
to the propagator becomes

then, after xing a dependence of the arbitrary constant c3 of the form |c3 (|~p|)|

where c is an arbitrary constant determined by the also arbitrary factor . an analysis of

therefore, the total modication to the propagator including all color values turns to be

finally, let us consider the possible modications of the ghost propagator which can be

(66)

in this case the calculation is simpler because of the fermionic character of the ghost
makes that only two non vanishing terms exist in the series expansion of the exponential.
therefore, here it is unnecessary to employ recurrence relations. the following result for
(66) is obtained

where in this case cg is an arbitrary nonnegative real constant. it will be equal to zero if
taking c3 (0) real and tending to one. this selection makes that the result coincides with
the one in the reference [10] where the ghost propagator was not modied.

finally in order to illustrate one of the main properties of the proposed modied pertur-
bation expansion, let us review here the calculation given in [10] of the gluon condensation
parameter, that is, the mean value of g2 in the ground state. in the simplest approximation,
that is, the mean value of g2 in the interaction free initial state, it corresponds to evaluate

l (xl). as usual in
this convention, the equality of two of compact indices i, j...l means the sum over the color
and lorentz indices and the subsequent integration over the spacetime coordinates. the
symbol dij is just the kernel of the gluon propagator (65). the rst and second terms in the
squared brackets have zero contribution as evaluated in dimensional regularization at zero
value of the sources. on the other hand the last terms corresponding with quartic gluon
self-interaction gives a non vanishing addition to the gluon condensation parameter precisely
due to the condensate term in the propagator.

therefore, it turns out that the procedure is able to predict the gluon condensation at

the most simple approximation.

v. summary

by using the operational formulation of the quantum gauge fields theory developed by
kugo and ojima, a particular state vector of qcd in the non-interacting limit which obeys

15

the brst physical state condition was constructed. the general motivation for looking
for this wave-function is to search for a reasonably good description of low energy qcd
properties, through giving foundation to the perturbative expansion proposed in [10]. the
high energy qcd description should not be aected by the modied perturbative initial
state. in addition it can be expect that the adiabatic connection of the color interaction
starting with it as an initial condition, generate at the end the true qcd interacting ground
state. in case of having the above properties, the analysis would allow to understand the
real vacuum as a the superposition of innite number of soft gluon pairs.

it has been checked that properly xing the free parameters in the constructed state,
the perturbation expansion proposed in the former work is reproduced for the special value
 = 1 of the gauge constant. therefore, the appropriate gauge is determined for which the
expansion introduced in that article is produced by an initial state, satisfying the physical
state condition for the brst quantization procedure. the fact that the non-interacting
initial state is a physical one, lead to expect that the nal wave-function after the adiabatic
connection of the interaction will also satisfy the physical state condition for the interacting
theory. if this assumption is correct, the results of the calculations of transition amplitudes
in future, a
and the values of physical quantities should be also physically meaningful.
quantization procedure for arbitrary values of  will be also considered.
it is expected
that with its help the gauge parameter independence of the physical quantities could be
implemented. it seems possible that the results of this generalization will lead to  dependent
polarizations for gluons and ghosts and their respective propagators, which however could
produce  independent results for the physical quantities. however, this more involved
discussion will be delayed for future consideration.

it is important to mention now a result obtained during the calculation of the modica-
tion to the gluon propagator, in the chosen regularization. it is that the arbitrary constant
c is determined here to be real and positive. this outcome restricts an existing arbitrari-
ness in the discussion given in the previous work. as this quantity c is also determining
the square of the generated gluon mass as positive or negative, real or imaginary, therefore
it seems very congruent to arrive to a denite prediction of c as real and positive.

the modication to the standard free ghost propagator introduced by the proposed initial
state of the non interacting theory was also calculated. moreover, after considering the free
parameter in the proposed trial state as real, which it seems the most natural assumption,
the ghost propagator is not be modied. this unaltered free one particle greens function
was assumed in [10], as a possible variant suggested by the fact that the modication do not
contribute in the one loop calculation of the gluon self-energy.

some tasks which can be addressed in future works are: the study of the applicability
of the gell-mann and low theorem with respect to the adiabatic connection of the inter-
actions, starting from the here proposed initial state. the investigation the quantization of
zero modes (that is gluon states with exact vanishing four momentum). the ability to con-
sider them with success would allow a formally cleaner denition of the proposed state, by
excluding the auxiliary momentum ~p recursively used in the construction carry out. finally,
the application of the proposed perturbation theory in the study of some problems linked
with connement and the hadron structure.
