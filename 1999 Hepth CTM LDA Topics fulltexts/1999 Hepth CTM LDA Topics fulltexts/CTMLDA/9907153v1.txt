abstract

the adhm construction, which yields (anti-)selfdual congurations in clas-
sical yang-mills theories, is applied to an innite dimensional l2 vector space,
and as a consequence, a family of (anti-)selfdual congurations with a pa-
rameter q is obtained for su(2) yang-mills theory. this l2 formulation can
be seen as a q-analog of nahms monopole construction, so that the cong-
uration approaches the bps monopole at q  1 limit.

1 introduction

the nahm equation[1], whose solutions yield monopole congurations in
yang-mills(ym)/higgs system, has a discrete analog, the discrete nahm
equation.
in ref.[2], braam and austin give the correspondence between
monopoles on hyperbolic three-space h 3, the hyperbolic monopole[3], and
the solutions to the discrete nahm equation.
in this paper, we introduce
another way of the discretization to the nahm formalism, which gives the so-
lutions to the selfdual equation on euclidean four-space, not the bogomolnyi
equation on three-space with or without curvature.

the nahm formalism is based on the construction of instantons in sp(n)
ym theories by atiyah, drinfeld, hitchin, and manin(adhm)[4].
in the
adhm construction, an instanton goes with a nite dimensional vector space
whose dimensionality concerns with the topological index of the instanton,
for a review see [5]. almost two decades ago, nahm introduced innite di-
mensional vector spaces associated with each specic monopole conguration
for su(2)  sp(1) bogomolnyi equation[1]. the vector spaces are quater-
nionic l2  v where the l2 is dened on a nite range, e.g., [0, 2], and v
is a nite dimensional space[6]. in the present paper, we bring in, instead
of the l2 in the nahm formalism, an l2 vector space which is dened on
iq, a set of innite discrete points in a nite range with a cluster point, e.g.,
iq = { 1
2q2,   } where q  (0, 1) is a free parameter. the operators
acting on the l2 space turn out to be q-derivative operators rather than dif-
ferential ones for the case of l2. we shall nd that the adhmn (adhm and
nahm) construction still works in our q-derivative case, the l2 formulation,
and that we can obtain a one-parameter family of (anti-)selfdual gauge elds.
roughly speaking, the l2 formulation is a q-analog of adhmn construction,
so that the q-calculus is requisite[7]. this paper deals mainly with the ex-
plicit construction of (anti-)selfdual conguration, and we shall consider the
physical interpretation and the mathematical detail of the conguration in a
separate paper.

in the next section, we exhibit the one-parameter family of (anti-)selfdual
conguration associated with the l2 vector space. in section 3, we summarize
the l2 formulation of adhmn construction. the last section is devoted to
some discussion.

2 the anti-selfdual conguration

in line with the adhmn construction, the gauge connections a which make
up (anti-)selfdual curvatures are given by a particular vector v belonging to
the appropriate vector space, such as

a = < v, iv >,

(1)

where the symbol < , > denotes an inner product over the vector space
under consideration. in the next section, we perform the procedure to nd
the vector v associated with l2 vector space for the case of su(2)  sp(1)
gauge group. here we exhibit the resulting gauge connection and curvature,
with a parameter q  (0, 1), which is the product of the q-analog version of
adhmn construction. the connection form is 3

where the matrices x,  x

 span a representation of su(2). from
these components we can explicitly conrm the anti-selfduality f =  f ,
and the hermiticity f 

sin 

 = f.

4although the connection (2) is not su(2)-valued, we can obtain an su(2)-valued one
through a gauge transformation which preserves the curvature form. we will discuss
this point later.

4

although the gauge connection (2) is in the form of innite series, we
have two congurations with elementary function expression by taking special
values of the parameter q. one of them is the q  1 limit, which gives the
bps monopole conguration[9, 10] if we regard the time component a0 as
an adjoint higgs. this can be seen from

l 

sinh r

(15)

as we will see in the next section, this consequence is quite natural by con-
struction. the other is obtained if we take the q  0 limit, because

l, m   1 +

(16)

the gauge conguration has innite topological index also in this case.

3 the l2 formulation of adhmn construc-

tion

this section provides how to nd out the vector v in (1) by applying the l2
formulation, concisely.

in su(2) ym theory, one can associate the instanton of topological index
k with a (k + 1)-dimensional vector space. for the monopole congurations,
where we regard the a0 component as an adjoint higgs, nahm introduced
the innite dimensional hilbert space l2 instead of the nite dimensional
vector space. since the adhmn construction is established on quaternion
eld h, these vector spaces are all quaternionic. the vector v is to be
determined through the linear operator  restricted to the conditions that
 is quaternionic real and invertible, where  is an adjoint of . the
adhmn conditions on v are

and

v = 0,

< v, v > = 1.

(17)

(18)

in ref.[8] nahm chose the operator  = iz + x acting on l2[1/2, 1/2]h
to obtain the bps monopole conguration[9, 10].

5

2,  1

now we shall consider another class of innite dimensional vector space,
a vector space l2(iq)  h and dene the operator  acting on the space.
as mentioned earlier, we specify the dening region of l2(iq) as iq :=
{ 1
2q2,   }, q being a real parameter of 0 < q < 1, so that l2(iq) 
l2[1/2, 1/2] at the limit q  1. note that iq has a cluster point at zero. we
should emphasize that the discretization is multiplicative, which is distinct
from the discrete nahm case. next we dene the inner product over the l2
space. denoting a vector v  l2[iq]  h as v = f (x, z; q) where z  iq, let
its adjoint v be

v = [f (x, z; q)] = f (x, qz; q1),

(19)

then we easily see (v) = v. using this adjoint vector, we dene our inner
product

< w, v > = z 1/2

1/2

wv dqz := z 1/2

0

wv dqz z 1/2

0

wv dqz,

(20)

where the integral is so called thomae-jackson integral dened as

z a

0

f (z) dqz = a(1  q)



xn=0

f (aqn)qn,

(21)

so that (20) is in fact the innite summation over the discrete points of iq.
hereafter we call this integral q-integral, for simplicity.
introducing the
q-derivative operation

dqf (z) :=

f (z)  f (qz)

(1  q)z

,

(22)

we can observe that our inner product makes the q-derivative operator idq
self-adjoint up to boundary terms, that is

< idqw, v > = < w, idqv > .

now we x the linear operator  in (17) as

 = idq + x,

(23)

(24)

then we have  = idq + x due to the self-adjointness of idq under the l2-
inner product (20). the limit q  1 leads to   iz + x, which brings

6

the bps monopole[8]. one can easily nd the product  is quaternionic
real,

 = d2

q + 2ix0dq + |x|2
= (idq + +)(idq + ),

(25)

=0 x2

where |x|2 := p3

. thus if the invertible condition is fullled, we can
obtain an (anti-)selfdual gauge conguration through the vector v determined
by (17) and (18). one can prove the invertibility by constructing the inverse
function to  explicitly, i.e., nding out a function f (x; z, z; q) with
z, z  iq such that

f (x; z, z; q) = q(z, z).

(26)

here the right-hand side is a function taking non-zero value only when z = z.
since we are dealing with discrete space, the function q(z, z) should be
proportional to kroneckers delta z,z. further, when we consider the limit
q  1, it should become the ordinary -function in accordance with the bps
case. we introduce a sign or step function dened as

(z, z) = ( +1 if z  z

1 if z < z

for 0 < z, and ( +1 if z > z

1 if z  z

for z < 0.

(27)
one can easily nd that the q-derivative of (z, z) with respect to z gives
kroneckers delta, i.e.,

dq(z, z) =

2

(1  q)|z|

z,z.

(28)

designating the right hand side as the function 2q(z, z) in (26), and making
use of the q-analogs of exponential function

eq(z) =

eq(z) =





xn=0
xn=0

zn

,

(q; q)n
qn(n1)/2
(q; q)n

zn,

(29)

(30)

we obtain the solution to (26),

f (x; z, z; q) = 1

4r (z, z){eq(i+(1  q)qz)eq(i+(1  q)z)

eq(i(1  q)qz)eq(i(1  q)z)} + f0(x; z, z; q),

(31)

7

where f0(x; z, z; q) is a kernel of  to be determined by boundary con-
ditions, which does not need xing here. thus we have proven the invertible
condition. note that if we take the limit q  1, the function f comes exactly
to be the one in nahms bps derivation[8]. we therefore nd that the inner
product (20) with (19) is compatible with the adhmn conditions.

now, we solve (17) and (18) to determine v. observing that one of the

q-exponential functions (29) is the eigenfunction of dq

dqeq((1  q)z) = eq((1  q)z),

(32)

where  is an arbitrary z-independent matrix, we nd the functional form of
v as

v = eq(ix(1  q)z)n(x; q),

(33)

n(x; q) being a normalization function to be determined by the condition
(18). since both eq and n are quaternion-valued functions, we have to take
care the order of them, in general. next, let us x the functional form of n.
first we observe the l2 norm of eq(ix(1  q)z) is

< eq(ix(1  q)z), eq(ix(1  q)z) > = +(x0, r; q)  1 + (x0, r; q)  x, (34)

where the functions  are

(x0, r; q) =

( +

(q; q)2n+1(cid:18)i

 (+  )) ,

(35)

which are no longer quaternion-valued. note that x is an hermitian matrix
depending only on the angles  and . we roughly sketch the derivation of
(34) and (35) in the following. the adjoint of eq is

[eq(ix(1  q)z)] = eq(ix(1  q)z).

we can prove (36) by the fact

(q; q)n = (q1; q1)n(q)nqn(n1)/2.

thus if we directly apply the q-binomial theorem

where (a; q) := q

eq(ix(1  q)z)eq(ix(1  q)z) = +(x0, r; z; q)  1 + (x0, r; z; q)  x, (39)

for positive integer n, we obtain the result (34) and (35). next, we consider
the normalization condition (18), which now turns out to be

n(x; q)(+  1 +   x)n(x; q) = 1.

(44)

we can easily see that the inverse square root matrix (+1 +  x)1/2 works
well for n due to the fact

n(x; q) =

where we dened + =: l appeared in (6). note that we have n  = n,
trivially.

having obtained the vector v, (33) with (45), we can derive the gauge

connection (2) through (1) with the q-integral (20).

4 discussion

our derivation xes the functional form of v, and also the gauge connection
a, up to gauge transformation , which is realized by multiplying v a

9

matrix g(x; q) on the right. under this operation, the gauge connection
transforms

a = < v, iv >< vg, ivg > = gag + gig,

(46)

thus if g(x, q) is subject to g = g1, then the curvature transforms covari-
antly and the ym action is invariant. this implies our gauge transforma-
tion (46) is larger than the ordinary su(2) . as mentioned in section 2,
the gauge connection (2) is not su(2)-valued. the part violating the su(2)-
valuedness is the non-traceless and also non-hermitian term in (3). however,
we can eliminate the non-su(2) part without altering the su(2)-valued cur-
vature form (9)(14) by performing a transformation with g = g1, i.e.,

g(x; q) = " 

(1  q)2

4

2

+; q2!#1/4" 

(1  q)2

4

2

; q2!#1/4

 1.

(47)

this transformation has the form g = e1 with (; q) being real func-
tion, which means (47) does not belong to u(2). of course our curvature
transforms covariantly under an ordinary, i.e., q-independent, su(2) trans-
formation.

we can reduce one of the (anti-)selfdual conditions, f0r =  f0r, into the
form of liouville equation + = 2e, which is natural from the view-
point of the earlier work on multi-instanton derivation[11] and its equivalence
to the adhmn formalism.

to conclude, we have reformulated the adhmn formalism on the l2
vector space, and found the gauge eld conguration, which reduces to the
bps monopole conguration at a limiting case of the parameter. we can also
formulate the l2-analog of the nahm equation, which will shed a new light
on the consideration to spectral curves in monopole construction[6, 12, 13],
and to the integrability argument on the discrete nahm equation[14, 15].
