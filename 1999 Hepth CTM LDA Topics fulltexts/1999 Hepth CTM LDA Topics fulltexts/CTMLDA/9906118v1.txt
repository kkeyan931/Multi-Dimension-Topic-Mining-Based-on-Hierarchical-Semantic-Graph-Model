abstract

the so(4, 2) isometries of ads5 are realized non-linearly on its horospher-
ical coordinates (xm, ). on the other hand, penrose twistors have long been
known to linearly realize these symmetries on 4-dimensional minkowski space,
the boundary of ads5, parametrized by xm. here we extend the twistor con-
struction and dene a pair of twistors, allowing us to include a radial coordinate
in the construction. the linear action of so(4, 2) on the twistors induces the
correct isometries of ads5. we apply this new construction to the study of the
dynamics of a massive particle in ads5. we show that in terms of the twistor
variables the action takes a simple form of a 1-dimensional gauge theory. our
result might open up the possibility to nd a simple worldvolume action also
for the string propagating on ads5.

in [1] a two-dimensional world-sheet model was considered with manifest su(2, 2|4)
symmetry. the basic variables of the model are supertwistors which realize the sym-
metry linearly. from the supertwistors one can derive 4 xm and 16  [2, 3] coordinates
on which su(2, 2|4) is realized as the non-linear superconformal symmetries. since
the same symmetry group also appears as the isometry group of the ads5  s5 super-
space, it is natural to wonder in view of the ads/cft correspondence [4], whether
supertwistors might be useful variables to describe strings in this background. in this
brief note, we extend the purely bosonic twistor construction to include a radial co-
ordinate, based on the coset construction of ads5. the linear action of the su(2, 2)
group on these twistors induces the correct isometries of ads5. as a warm-up to
applying these new variables to strings propagating in an ads5  s5 superspace, we
then consider the (non-linear) action of a massive particle on ads5 and show how
the new twistors bring the action into a simple (and quantizable [5]) form, general-
izing the work of [6]. in fact, the resulting theory is nothing but a one-dimensional
u(1)  su(2) gauge theory of the form

then induces the non-linear conformal transformations of x from the simple linear
transformation of the twistor z. the non-trivial step in this parametrization of
conformal space is the twistor relation (8), which can be derived from the dynamics
of a massless particle [3]. however, here we derive the twistor relation from a purely
algebraic perspective, as the twistor parametrization of conformal space is closely
related to the coset-space construction. this will allow us to generalize the procedure
to the full ads5 space.

the parametrization of a coset space is encoded in the coset representative v(x),
where x are the coordinates of the space. as a function of coordinates v(x) trans-
forms under an innitesimal action of the group g as

v(x)  m

g (x)mv(x) = gv(x) + v(x)hg(x)

(9)

with m = 1, ..., dim g/h, g  g, the lie-algebra associated to g, and hg(x) is a
space-time dependent compensating transformation in the lie-algebra of h. eq. (9)
is equivalent to the general relation [7]

v1gv = m

g lm + hg(x) ,

(10)

1as usual in the twistor literature,  and   are commuting, two-component complex spinors.

our conventions are explained in the appendix.

2the universal covering group of the conformal group so(4, 2) is su (2, 2). its compact su (2)

subgroups act as rotations on chiral and antichiral spinors, respectively.

where lm = v1mv is the cartan 1-form in g. the m
m

g (x), that realize g non-linearly on the coordinates. clearly, an object

g are the isometries, x m =

z = v(x)z0

(11)

will transform rigidly in the fundamental of g, i.e. z = gz, i z0 = hg(x)z0.

twistors turn this reasoning upside down. whenever we dene a vector z0 by
(11) and demand that z transforms in the fundamental of g, it is guaranteed that z0
will transform under the correct compensating transformation hg(x). if we want to
impose a twistor relation on z, it turns out to be most useful to put a constraint on z0,
eectively relating the components of z via x. hereby, one only has to demand that
the constraint is covariant under the compensating h-transformations. a consistent
twistor relation can therefore be obtained from the coset space by dening a vector
z0 through (11) and constraining it in a h covariant way.

we illustrate the above discussion with the twistor formulation of conformal space.

the conformal transformations in spinorial notation

x  = (cid:16)a  + x l

from (5) and (11) one constructs

(15)

which needs to be constrained h-covariantly. the only form of z0 transforming
covariantly under (13) is

z0 = (cid:18) 0
0 (cid:19) ,

(16)

which implies the conformal twistor relation (8), as desired. in this case nding the
proper constraint (16) was straightforward. the so(1, 3) in h allows for chiral/anti-
chiral spinors, or majorana spinors. however, only the chiral spinor 
0 of (16) trans-
forms covariantly under special conformal transformations.

this example illustrates nicely the method we have developed of constructing
twistors via the coset representative. we can now extend the procedure to the full
ads5 case.

the metric and isometries (3) and (4) follow from the coset construction of
ads5 = so(4, 2)/so(4, 1). we choose the coset representative vads(xm, ) in the
spinor representation of so(4, 2)

vads(x, ) =   1/2

and, in spinorial notation, the isometries (4) take the form

(19)

we wish to replace the coordinates (xm, ) with twistor variables, on which a
linear su(2, 2) transformation induces (18) and (19). naturally, one would want to
dene as above a twistor z, and relate it via the coset representative to a vector
z0. on z0 then a constraint has to be imposed transforming covariantly under h,
eectively relating the components of z via the coset coordinates. in this case we have
h = so(1, 4), and z0 should transform in the spinor representation of this group.
there are neither weyl nor majorana fermions in (1,4) dimensions, and there does
not exist a covariantly constrained spinor. therefore, a straightforward extension of
(8) incorporating the radial  coordinate of the ads space does not exist. however, in
(1,4) dimensions one can dene pseudo-symplectic majorana fermions i satisfying

(i) = ij bj ,

i, j = 1, 2 .

(20)

the matrix b satises

bt = b,

bb = 1,

bb = 1 ,

m = b mb1,


(21)

where  m are the 5-dimensional -matrices.
above the matrix b takes the form

in the two-component notation used

b =   0

(22)

since one can impose a restriction only on a pair of spinors, we have to extend the
twistor construction to a pair of twistors

z i = (cid:18) i
 i (cid:19)



transforming in the fundamental of su(2, 2)

z i = gz i .

just as in (11) one relates these twistors to a pair of spinors z i

0 via

where z i

0 transforms as

z i = vads(x, )z i
0 ,

z i

0 = hg(x)z i
0 .

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

as discussed, the only h-covariant condition which can be placed on the z i
pseudo-symplectic majorana condition

0 is the

(z i

0 ) = ij bz j
0 ,

(27)

which leads to the form

z i

(28)

with unrestricted i

0 and  i

0 = (0

0 (cid:19)

ij  j

0 = (cid:18) i
)  . the generalization of (8) now becomes

 i = ix i

 j .

(29)

it is straightforward to verify that from this ads twistor relation, (24) and (6), the
ads isometries (18) follow.

the pair of twistors trade the 5 coordinates (xm, ) for 8 complex degrees of
freedom z i, which are related as in (29). this relation was derived from a purely
algebraic perspective. using this explicit relation we can nd the invariant quadratic
constraints the twistor pair satises. the su(2, 2) group can be dened as the trans-
formations that leave the metric

hsu (2,2) =   0

0 !

invariant. therefore the bilinear form

z(1)z(2) = (1)(2) +  (1) (2) ,

(30)

(31)

5

where

z = z h = (,  )

(32)

is the conjugate representation, is a quadratic invariant. with a pair of twistors we
can dene the general bilinear invariant

z igijz j = z i

0 gijz j
0 ,

(33)

where gij is 2-dimensional constant complex matrix. the equality above holds be-
cause z i and z i
0 are related by the su(2, 2) matrix vads. we can expand the matrix
g in a basis

tij

a = nij , (i)ijo ,

(34)

where i are the pauli-matrices satisfying 12 = i3 and a takes values 0, 1, 2, 3.
from the relation (29) we obtain the constraints

z i ij

i z j = 0 ,

(35)

which imply that the two components z 1 and z 2 of the twistor pair have the same
length z 1z 1 = z 2z 2 and are orthogonal z 1z 2 = z 2z 1 = 0. however, there is a
fourth independent invariant bilinear

z iijz j = 2 mr ,

(36)

which takes arbitrary real values m. the parameter m has the dimension of a mass.
indeed, we will relate it to the mass of a particle propagating in the ads5 background.
before discussing this we contrast these constraints to the conformal space. in that
case there is only one twistor and the quadratic invariant

zz = z0z0

(37)

necessarily vanishes due to (16). this equation denes a surface in twistor space,
which is related to the phase space of a massless particle [3].

the rst order (or phase space) action of a massive particle in ads5 is given by

s = z d (cid:20) p m x m 

e

2 (cid:16) p mg mn pn + m2(cid:17)(cid:21) .

(38)

the momenta p m = (pm, p) are conjugate to x m = (xm, ) and g mn is the inverse
ads5-metric (3). translating this into two-component notation yields

s = z d " 1

p  x   p

(40)

the worldline einbein e( ) is a lagrange multiplier for the mass-shell constraint

22 p p   2p 2

(41)

we rewrite the momenta in terms of the twistor variables i

i
  c.c.(cid:17) ,
22 (cid:16)ij i

and the second pair of twistor components i are introduced as in (29). it follows
straightforwardly that

.

(43)

the constraint (41) forces this to equal m2 and therefore we relate the invariant
z iijz j to the mass m as in (36). in other words (36) is equivalent to the mass-shell
constraint. it turns out that, like for the massless particle in 1+3 dimensions [6], the
action for an on-shell particle (41) can be rewritten entirely in twistor variables,

s = z d (cid:18)1

2

p  x   p (cid:19) = iz d z i z i ,

where the twistor pair is subject to the four real constraints (35) and (36)

a = z itij

a z j  2a

0mr .

(44)

(45)

if we wish to elevate the twistors to independent variables, the constraints (45) have
to be imposed via lagrange multipliers ua and the total action becomes

s = iz d (cid:16) z i z i  iuaa(cid:17) .

(46)

the appearence of the lagrange multiplier terms generates gauge symmetries which
act on the elds as

a z j ,

z i = ia( )tij
u0 =  0( ) ,
ui =  i( ) + 2iijkj( )uk ,

(47)

where a( ) are 4 local parameters and form an u(1)  su(2) algebra. therefore, we
can rewrite the action (46) as a 1-dimensional gauge theory action

s = iz d (cid:16) z id z i + 2iu0mr(cid:17) ,

7

(48)

where

d z i = (ij   iuatij

a )z j

(49)

and the lagrange multipliers act as gauge elds.

we have shown that the construction of twistors, realizing the conformal symme-
try su(2, 2) of 4-dimensional minkowski space linearly, can be generalized to include
the radial coordinate of the ads5 space. to do so, we employed the coset descriptions
of the conformal space and the ads5 space, and we had to extend the twistor con-
struction to a pair of twistors subject to important constraints. in essence, we built
a bridge between the twistor formulation of su(2, 2), and the description of ads5 as
a hyperboloid in (2,4) dimensions. in the latter, the coordinates of the 6-dimensional
embedding space also realize the conformal symmetry g = so(2, 4)  su(2, 2)
linearly, although in the fundamental of so(2, 4). the generalized twistors realize
the symmetry linearly in the spinor representation of so(2, 4) which is equivalent
to the fundamental representation of su(2, 2). one advantage of our procedure is
that it seems to have a straightforward generalization to the supersymmetric case
su(2, 2|n ), i.e. to nd a twistor realization of the ads5  s5 superspace. all one
needs to do is to construct the supercoset representative and nd the proper constraint
on z0. this will essentially be the same constraints as for the bosonic space since the
compensating transformation in the supersymmetric case is also purely bosonic. in
that way one could nd the supersymmetric generalization of dening ads5  s5 as
a 10-dimensional hypersurface in 12 dimensions.

we have also shown that these twistors appear naturally as the fundamental vari-
ables of a massive particle propagating in ads5. it would be interesting to investigate
whether we can extent the superparticle action to a simple supertwistor one as well.

the most exciting aspect of our result however is the simplicity of the action (48).
the quantization of this action will be considered in an accompanying paper [5]. it
might pave the way to a simple quantization of the string on ads5. one would hope
that (44) generalizes to the string action in the same straightforward way it did in
at space, viewed as the boundary limit of ads5 ([6] vs. [1]). if this is the case then
the string spectrum constructed in [1] from a stringy toy world-sheet model should
indeed be the spectrum of strings on ads5  s5.

we associate a real 4-dimensional vector x m to a hermitian matrix
