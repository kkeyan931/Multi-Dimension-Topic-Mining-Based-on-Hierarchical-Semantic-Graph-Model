abstract

we analyze the possibility of description of ddimensional massless particles by the lagrangians

of this model are given by space-like curves with zero 2n th curvature for n  [(d  2)/2]. massless
spinning particles correspond to the curves with constant kn +a/kn a ratio. it is shown that only the

linear on world-line curvatures ki, s =pn
i=1 cir kids. we show, that the nontrivial classical solutions
system with action s = cr kn ds leads to irreducible representation of poincare group. this system

has maximally possible number (n + 1) of gauge degrees of freedom.
its classical solutions obey
the conditions kn +a = kn a, a = 1, . . . , n  1, while rst n curvatures ki remain arbitrary. this
solution is specied by coinciding n weights of the massless representation of little lorentz group,
while the remaining weights vanish.

1 introduction

the search of lagrangians, describing spinning particles, both massive and massless, has a long story.
the conventional approach in this direction consists in the extension of the initial space-time ird1.1 by
the auxiliary odd/even coordinates equip a system with spinning degrees of freedom.

there is another, less developed approach, where the spinning particle systems are described by the
lagrangians, which are formulated in the initial space-time, but depend on higher derivatives. the
aesthetically attractive point of the last approach is that spinning degrees of freedom are encoded in the
geometry of its trajectories. the poincare and reparametrization invariance require the actions to be of
the form

where ki denote the reparametrization invariants (extrinsic curvatures) of curves (0 < i  d  1), ds
denotes (pseudo)arch length:

ds =(cid:26) |dx|
|d2x|1/2

for non  isotropic curves

for isotropic curves

.

(1.2)

various systems of this sort, depending on the rst and the second curvatures of path in ir3.1 and ir2.1
are known (see [1, 2, 3, 5] and refs therein). nevertheless, the only system, which leads to irreducible
representation of poincare group, is the model in ir3.1, given by the action[1]

s = cz k1ds,

which describes the massless spinning particle with the helicity c (which, upon quantization, may take
arbitrary integer or half integer values). surprisingly, this model has w3 gauge symmetry [3], and is
specied by the classical trajectories, which are space-like plane curves with arbitrary rst curvature:
k1 = , k2 = 0.

all other three- and four dimensional models lead to the reducible representations of poincare group.
for example, the analog of plyushchays model on isotropic curves describes massive spinning particles
with majorana-like spectrum [5],

spin  mass = c2/4.

the subject of this work is to analyze the problem:

can massless spinning particles in d > 4 dimensional space-time be described by the actions (1.1)?

in other words, do exist the actions (1.1), which generate the constraints, corresponding to the massless
irreducible representations of poincare group [6, 7]?

for this purpose we perform the classical investigation of the d-dimensional massless (due to explicit

scale invariance) model on non-isotropic curves given by the action

(1.4)

we restrict ourselves by the lagrangians linear on curvatures, since they are specied by the maximally
possible (for given n ) set of primary constraints [8]. therefore, they are the only candidates to describe
the massless particle systems, corresponding to irreps.

we establish the following interesting properties of the model (1.3):

 only the systems with

n  n0 = [(d  2)/2],

admit nontrivial classical solutions (n0 is the rank of the little lorentz group);

 the classical solutions of the model under consideration are space-like curves with k2n =0; the
solutions, corresponding to irreps, are specied by constant kn +a/kn a ratio, a = 1, . . . , n  1;
 the solutions, corresponding to reducible representations, always exist, if pn

on the other hand, there is special case of (1.3), exceptional from many points of view, given by the
action

i=1 |ci| > |cn|.

the remarable properties of the model (1.5) are the following:

s = cz kn ds, n  n0 = [(d  2)/2]

(1.5)

 the solution of the system (1.5) leads to the irreducible representation of poincare group. this
solution are specied by the following weights of the little lorentz group: m1 = m2 = . . . = mn =
c, mn +1 = . . . = mn0 = 0.

 the model (1.5) has n + 1 gauge degrees of freedom, corresponding, probably, classical limit of

wn +2 algebra.

 the classical solution of this model is space-like curve specied by the relations: k1, . . . kn are

arbitrary; kn +1 = kn 1, . . . , kn +n 1 = k1, k2n = 0.

the paper is arranged as follows.
in section 2 we give the hamiltonian formulation of the system (1.3) and analyze its general properties.
in section 3 we present the complete set of constraints for the model (1.5) and for the models given by
(1.3), where n = 2, 3 c1cn 6= 0 and n  3, ci2 = 0, cn 1cn 6= 0,

i = 3, . . . n,.

2 hamiltonian formulation

in order to obtain the hamiltonian formulation of the system with the action (1.3) we have to replace
it by the classically equivalent one, which depend on the rst-order derivatives, and then perform the
legendre transformation. for this purpose it is more convenient to use (instead of explicit expressions
(1.4)) the recurrent equations for curvatures, which follows from the frenet equations for moving frame
{ea}:

k .

ab + k .

ba = 0, k .

x = se1,

ea = sk b

ab =(cid:26) ka,

0,

a eb,
if
if

eaeb = ab,
b = a  1
b 6= a  1

,

ka  0.

in the euclidean space the frenet equations read

x = se1,

ea = skaea+1  ska1ea1,

e0 = ed+1  0, k0 = kd = 0.

consecuently, we get

s = | x| = xe1,

ski = eiei+1 =q e2

i  (ski1)2.

it is easy to verify, that for the transition to the frenet equations for non-isotropic curves in the pseudo-
euclidean space, we do have to substitute,

(ea, ska, ska1, s)  (iea, iska, iska1, (i)1a s)

(2.5)

for some index a.
the choice a = 1 means the transition to time-like curve, while a = 2, . . . , d- to space-like ones. by this
reason, through the paper we use the euclidean signature.

taking into account the expressions (2.3),(2.4) one can replace the initial lagrangian (1.3) (in arbitrary

time parametrization ds = sd , s = | x|) by the following one
l = spi ci1ki1 + cnq e2

n  (sk)2

n 1 + p( x  se1) +pi pi1( ei1  ski1ei + ski2ei2)
spi,j dij (eiej  ij )

(2.6)

where s, ki1, dij , pi1, ei are independent variables, k0 = 0, p0 = e0 = 0.

performing the legendre transformation for this lagrangian (see for details [8]), one get the hamil-

tonian system with the hamiltonian structure

h = shpe1 +pn

and the primary constraints

notice that in this formulation s and ski play the role of lagrangian multipliers, so that stabilization of
primary constraints generates either secondary ones, or the explicit relations on the rst n curvatures.

it is convenient to introduce the new variables, instead of pi,

since the constraints uij are conjugated to ij and commute with p

i and ij , we can impose, without

in these variables the equations of motion (in proper-time gauge s = 1) read

(2.15)

now let us construct the secondary constraints.

stabilization of the constraint (2.8) generates the following set of constraints

pei  0, ppi  0, p2  0,

(2.16)

which provide the model by the mass-shell and transversality conditions. all the secondary constraints
produced by the primary ones (2.11) are the functions of ij and ij, because these functions commute
with uij,(2.8) and form closed algebra. one can arrange these functions in the matrices

rp

ij = (p

ij , p

ij), p

ij  i.i+p, p

i.j  i.2n +1ip,

p = 1, . . . , n,

so that the secondary constraints of (p + 1)th stage, depend on rp1. thus stabilization procedure
contains at most n stage.
however, the choice of secondary constraints is not uniquely dened for any lagrangian if n > 2.

the primary constraints (2.11) generate the following rst-stage secondary constraints,

at the next stage we get the system of linear equations on ki:

n 1.n  0, i2.i  0,

i = 3, . . . , n.

(2.17)

(2.18)

ki4i4.i1  ki3ci2 + ki2ci3  ki1i3.i  0,
i = 3, . . . , n

kn 2n 2.n + kn 1(n 1.n 1  c2

n ) + kn cn cn 1  0.




so, only the system with the action (1.5) give rize to uniquely dened second-stage secondary constraints.
which is the rule for choosing the secondary constraints, whicho we have to follow in order to obtain

the solution, corresponding to massless spinning particle?
from (2.16) it is seen , that n  [(n  2)/2], while the helicity matrix is of the form

i  ei

(2.19)

therefore, only the solutions, containing n stabilization stages, correspond to irreps. to get a massless
spinning particle system, we have to choose the constraints, which lower the rank of the system of the
equations linear in ki, and are compatible with the conditions ki 6= 0.

from the equations of motion (2.14) on can see that space-like vectors (e, p

i ) dene rst 2n (non-
normalized) elements of moving frame, while p denes its (2n + 1)th, isotropic element. one can
orthonormalize the vectors p

(2.21)

summarizing the results, obtained in this section, we conclude

proposition. the systems with the actions (1.3) admit nontrivial classical solutions, if n  [(d 
2)/2]. these solutions are space-like curves with zero 2nth extrinsic curvature. the curves with
constant ratio kn +a/kn a correspond to the massless particles with xed helicities (the classical analogs
of irreps). the only system, whose solutions corresponds to irreps, is dened by the action (1.5).

3 examples

in this section we consider the explicit examples of the systems dened by the action (1.3).

example 1:l = ckn .

we start with the basic example, given by the action (1.5), whose solutions correspond to the massless
irreducible representations of poincare group.

primary constraints (2.11) generate the maximally possible set (n 2) of constraints, all of them are of

the rst-class,

ij  0, ij  c2ij  0.

(3.1)

the lagrangian multipliers ki remain arbitrary, hence the system has n + 1 gauge degrees of freedom.
this is in correspondence with the conjecture of [4] that the gauge symmetries of the action (1.5) dene
the classical limit of wn +2 algebra. taking into account (2.21), we conclude, that classical solution of
the system under consideration is given by space-like curve, specied by the conditions

k1, . . . , kn are arbitrary,

kn +a = kn a, a = 1, . . . , n  1,

k2n = 0.

the dimension of phase space is

so,

dphys = 2(d  1) + n (2d  3n  5),

n0(2d  3n0  5) =(cid:26) (d  2)(d  4)/4,
(d  1)(d  5)/4,

for even d,
for odd d.

let introduce the complex variables

zi = (pi + cei)/2

in which the hamiltonian system reads

 = dp  dx + 

cpi dzi  dzi,

h = s

2ch2p(z1  z1) + pn 1

a=1 ka(zaza+1  za+1za) + kn (zn zn  c2)i ,

5

(3.2)

(3.3)

while the constraints take the conventional form

zizj  c2ij  0,

zizj  0,
pzi  0,
p2  0.

(3.4)

the eigenvalues of the helicity matrix s, ranks = n , are given by the relations tr s2i = c2i,
so, the system is specied by the following weights mi of the little lorentz group:

i = 1, . . . n .

for n = n0 this solution possesses conformal symmetry2[10].

m1 = . . . = mn = c, mn +1 = . . . = mn0 = 0.

example 2: l = c1k1 + c2k2, c1 6= 0.

for this system the constraints (2.11) produce the secondary constraint 1.2  0 and the relation on the
curvatures

k2c2c1 + k1(1.1  c2

2) = 0,

the dimension of phase space is d = 2(3d  10), while the value of 1.1 remains unxed (this function
denes the constant of motion).

let us denote 1.1  c2. then the curvatures obey the conditions

k2c2c1 = k1(c2

2  c2),
while the helicities are dened by the expressions
2  c2

trs2i = (c2

1)i + (c2  c2

1)i,

i = 1, 2.

ck3 = c2k1,

k4 = 0

example 3: l =p3

i=1 ciki, c1c3 6= 0.

the primary constraints (2.11) produce the following secondary constraints of the rst and second stage

and the relations on the lagrangian multipliers

2.3  0, 1.3  0, 1.2  0,

ak (cid:18) c3c2

c3c1
1.3 2.2  c2

 = 0

(3.5)

when rank a = 2 the system has no other secondary constraints, and the helicities of the system are
unxed.

however, if c1c2c3 6= 0, one can lower the rank of a choosing

so the only preserved relation on curvatures is

2.2 = c2

3  c1c3, 1.3 = c2c3,

stabilizing the constraints (3.6) we get

c2(k1  k3)  c1k2 = 0.

1.2  0,

(1.1  c2

3  c1c3)k1  c2c3k2 = 0

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

thus, the function 1.1, being the constant of motion, remains arbitrary, and we have two relations on
curvatures.

for this system we consider only those sets of constraints, which dene the solutions, corresponding to

where a, b = 1, . . . n  2;, ,  = n  1, n .

so, we conclude, that the system under consideration has the solution, corresponding to irrep. besides

the reparametrization and scale invariance, this solution possesses an extra gauge freedom.
