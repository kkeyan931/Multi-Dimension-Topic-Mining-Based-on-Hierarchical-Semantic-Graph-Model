we discuss the matrix model aspect of congurations saturating a xed number of

fermionic zero modes. this number is independent of the rank of the gauge group and

the instanton number. this will allow us to dene a large-nc limit of the embeddeding
of k d-instantons in the matrix model and make contact with the leading term (the

measure factor) of the supergravity computations of d-instanton eects. we show that

the connection between these two approaches is done through the abelian modes of the

matrix variables.

1. introduction

over the four past years some tremendous progress and insights about the non-

perturbative and global behaviour of supersymmetrical gauge theory, superstring theory

and supergravities have appeared. all these advances are founded on a web of consistent

cross-checked conjectures culminating with the idea of m-theory as the mother of all theo-

ries. most of the impressive and exact non-perturbative results were derived by considering

bps saturated amplitudes. due to the saturation of the fermionic zero-modes these terms

are protected by some non-renormalisation theorems and can be computed both in the

perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. this is the case of the eight-fermions terms in

the three-dimensional super yang-mills theory [1], the d-instantons of the type iib string

theory [2], or the wrapped d1-brane around torii of dimensions smaller than ve in the

type i theory [3].

in these cases, these d-instantons contributions belong to half-bps

multiplet of the theory, and they come from amplitudes where sixteen or eight fermionic

zero-modes, respectively for the type iib and type i theory, have to be soaked up. the

surprising aspect of these results is that even in a vacuum containing k d-instantons it is

only necessary to saturate the same xed number of fermionic zero modes, independently

of k. this is because of the existence of threshold bound states of d0-branes and the

action of t-duality which exchange k dp-branes on top of each other singly wrapped
around a p + 1-torus with one dp  1-brane wrapped k-times around a p-torus, and the
fact that the presence of winding modes does not break supersymmetry.1

in the context of the correspondence between the supergravity results and the cft

computation, this independence of fermionic zero-modes with respect to the instantons

number becomes much more obscure. lets consider for example the case of a vacuum

containing k d3-branes:

it was claimed in [4] and impressively proven in [5] that the

large-nc limit of this theory is in correspondence with the four-dimensional super yang-
mills theory with gauge group su (nc) in the large-nc t hooft limit (ncg2
y m = cst).
this conrmation used a sector of the theory with a xed number of fermionic zero modes

independently of nc. the puzzle is that in the super yang-mills case one would normally

think that when the rank of the gauge group increases there are extra fermionic zero-

modes and the result cannot match the supergravity ones. in fact it was understood by

[5], that an embedding of a conguration of k instantons in the su (nc) group has a xed

1 it should be noted that is not true for bound states of d-particle and anti-d-particle.

number of fermionic zero-modes independant of the number of instantons and the rank of

the group.

the main purpose of the present article, is to explain that in the context of matrix

models, such a conguration of fermionic zero-modes can be realized, and can lead to a

way to dene a large-nc limit of the matrix model.

in section 2, we will introduce the supergravity aspect of the d-instanton eects, in

section 3 we will introduce the matrix model that we will use in the following. section 4,

contains a discussion of the dynamics of these models emphasing importance to consider

a gauge-invariant model. in section 5 we compute the partition function of the matrix

model with various symmetry, and map these results to the supergravity results in sec-

tion 6. section 7 contains a discussion of this approach. appendix a contains an explicit

computation of the partition function of the supersymmetric matrix model with 2 real

supercharges and appendix b summarises our convention for the  matrices used in the

text.

2. the supergravity side

the type iib chiral version of the ten dimensional supergravity is peculiar in several

respects. first, being chiral with maximum number of supersymmetries, with two sets

of sixteen real component supercharges of the same space-time chirality, dened with
respect to the projector (1  11)/2, in ten-dimensions it has a richer moduli space than
its non-chiral counter-part the type iia supergravity. the superspace formalism of this

chiral supergravity theory was worked out in [6] and will be used here. the superspace
formalism uses a supermanifold with ten even coordinates, x ( = 0,    , 9), and sixteen
odd complex coordinates,2  ( = 1,    , 16), and their complex conjugates () def=  ,
the whole set packaged in zm def= (x, ,  ). at each point in the superspace there are
some local coordinates related to the one-form dzm by the vielbein

dea def= dzm ea
m ,

and as for usual riemann manifolds the vielbein are invertible

2 these coordinates will be put in correspondence with the zero modes of the matricial

fermions (see section 6.2).

the tangent space is described by the covering of the group so(1, 9) u (1)b. the u (1)b
factor is a local phase transformation on the fermionic coordinates by

  exp(cid:18)i

   exp(cid:18)i

it was shown in [6] that this u (1)b factor is precisely the factor appearing in the coset
space parametrisation su (1, 1)/u (1)b  sl(2, r)/u (1)b of this theory. the sl(2, r) is a
rigid transformation acting on the left of the elds and the u (1)b induced by the chiral
nature of the theory is a local transformation acting on the right of the coset. as in [7] we

parametrise this coset with the matrix

v def=

ei (cid:19) .

the sl(2, r) group acts by a matrix multiplication on the left of this matrix and the scalar
 transforms by a fractional linear transformation   (a + b)/(c + d). the u (1)b acts
on the right by

with

using the equations of motion of the supergravity allows us to relate the eld  to
the ramond scalar eld c(0) and the dilaton and the string coupling constant gs = exp()
as

 = c(0) +

gs

.

the second special feature of this chiral theory resides in its peculiar point-like soli-

tonic solution to the equations of supergravity. despite the fact that this solution looks

singular, because it is localised in space-time, it belongs to the class of d-branes instantonic

solutions [8]. the metric induced by the presence of n d-instantons is given (in euclidean

space) in the einstein metric [9]

where  is a complex chiral so(9, 1) spinor which transforms under the ub(1) r-symmetry

with charge 3/2 (see [10] for detailed expressions). quantum eects induced by looping
around an arbitrary number of d-instantons are given by the functions f (w,w)(, ). the
functions f (w,w) are modular forms of sl(2, z) of indicated weight up to a phase [11]
(  sl(2, z))

c + d(cid:19)w
f (w,w)(  ,   ) =(cid:18) c + d

f (w,w)(, ).

they are connected to the modular function f (0,0) by repeated action of the covariant
derivative d = (i2 + w/2) which maps a (q, p) modular form into a (q + 1, p  1) form
[10,12]. the small coupling expansion, gs  0, of the f (w,w) reads

where the rst two terms have the form of string tree-level and one-loop terms and gk,w

the phase of these modular functions are compensated by those of the elds multi-

plying them in the action. these elds carry a tensorial structure which has a well dened

u (1)b weight induced by the coset space structure of the theory [12]. as was discovered
in [6,7], all these terms can be packaged in a chiral supereld (zm ) for the type iib

supergravity, satisfying the constraints,

d = 0, d4 = 0 = d4.

these constraints imply that this supereld is independent of () and is a function
(x  , ), which can be expanded in terms of  and  = t 0 as [6,7]

 =   2i

(2.5)

and the correction to the action can be obtained by picking the terms containing sixteen

powers of  in the taylor expansion of some unknown function of the chiral supereld

 [12]

s(3) = l2

s z d10xd16 det(em

 ) (f [] + c.c.) .

the supereld only depends on half of the fermionic coordinates this is natural

as it is related to the contribution of the d-instanton which are 1/2-bps states. this

welcome feature will enable us to nd a correspondence of this eld in the matrix model in

section 6.2. we will now turn to an interpretation of the previous formulae in the matrix

model setting.

3. the matrix model

as the dp-brane, and in particular the d-instantons (p = 1), have their dynamics
described by open strings attached on their world-sheet [8]; the low energy excitations of n

dp-branes on top of each other are described by a dimensional reduction to p+1 dimension

of the ten dimensional super yang-mills theory with gauge group u (n ) [13] (see [14] for a

comprehensive lecture on the subject). the ten dimensional super yang-mills theory with

the lagrangian

this theory is invariant under the supersymmetry transformation

 is a majorana-weyl spinor.

for later convenience, we rewrite the elds and the supersymmetry transformation by
def= x+xi,

splitting the su (n ) and the abelian u (1) part of the matrices:  def= +i, a

def= f + f i and

for the su (n ) part and

for the u (1) part.

in the particular case of the d-instanton we get a zero-dimensional model, i.e. the

variables do not depend anymore on any coordinates, called the ikkt matrix model

[15,13]. the lagrangian reduces to

(3.2)

with  a majorana-weyl spinor. as all the elds are in the adjoint of the group the

abelian piece of the coordinates has disappeared in the previous action, but as we will see

in section 6.2 this part still plays a role in the dynamics of the model. it should be noted
that this supersymmetry transformation is a superspace translation for the coordinate zm .

6

as this model gives a description of the low-energy excitation of the open string

with end points xed on the d-instantons, the gauge coupling of this model is xed to be
g2
0 = gs/l4
s.

two other models connected to the considerations of this article are, the dimensional

reduction to the quantum mechanical model in 1 + 0 dimensions [16,17], known as the

bfss model after its revival by the article [18]

in order to stress the importance of the supersymmetry we will consider more gen-

eraly the models deduced by dimensional reduction from the d = 3, 4, 6 and 10 super

yang-mills theory. the amplitudes associated with these 1/2-bps contributions corre-

spond to the vacuum expectation values of the same number of fermionic zero modes as

the non-broken supersymmetries. that is, sixteen real fermions for d = 10, eight real

fermions for d = 6 and four real fermions for d = 4. this product of fermionic zero
modes is the fermion number operator of the theory ()f . so this amplitude is (a part
of) the witten index of the model.

4. the dynamics of the models

these matrix models all have in common a quartic bosonic potential vb = tr[x, x]2
and fermionic one vf = trt 0[x, ]. as the coordinates are hermitian matrices the
potential vb is negative denite. the classical space of congurations is given by the

7

vanishing of this potential vb = 0 = vf , and is described by the space parametrised by
the eigenvalues of the matrices modulo permutations, so this is

if we have d matrix coordinates x i (i = 1, . . . , d) in the adjoint of u (n ) whose weyl group

m =(cid:0)rd(cid:1)n

/sn ,

is sn . the potential is composed of valleys along the direction in the cartan subalgebra of
the group with a harmonic oscillator like shape vb  2y2 for the coordinates orthogonal
to these directions.

the description of this system in term of harmonic oscillators shows that the spec-

trum of the purely bosonic theory is discrete (see [20] for a mathematical proof, [21] for

computer evidence). the physical argument given in [17], is that you choose a at direction
by setting the coordinate x d in the cartan subalgebra of the group, then all transverse
coordinate have an harmonic potential vb  |x d|2y 2. the quantum model has a zero
point energy e0  |x d|/2 which is linearly growing along the at direction, preventing the
wave function from extending to innity along x d and localising it. then it follow that the

spectrum is discrete. as was rigourously shown by de wit, luscher and nicolai in [17], the

spectrum of the supersymmetric theory is continuous. this is due to the cancellation of

the zero energy between the transverse uctuations of the bosonic coordinates orthogonal

to the cartan directions and their fermionic partners. their result showing that there is

continuous spectrum does not prevent the theory having a discrete spectrum sitting in the

middle of it. a non-zero value for the witten index of the theory will show that. the

computation of the index is complicated by the presence of the continuous spectrum and

the at directions which could lead to infra-red divergencies. but as noticed from explicit

computation [22,23,24] this is not the case. we recall briey how to perform the compu-

tation of the witten index in order to justify the infra-red niteness of the model we will

consider later on.

the witten index of the the u (n ) supersymmetric quantum mechanical model in
d 1 dimensions ((3.3) is the particular case d = 10) is dened as the trace with insertion
of the fermion counting operator

it was shown by yi [23] and sethi and stern [24], that the computation can be

iw

reduced to computing the bulk part

8

iw () = lim

and a decit part

which can be rewritten as

d
d

d

0

eh(cid:17) .

idef icit = z 

0

dtr(cid:0)()f heh(cid:1) =ze>0{+(e)  (e)}

from this expression it is obvious that the non zero value of the decit term is given by

the continuous part of the spectrum, as the discrete parts cancels by supersymmetry. the

total index can be rewritten as

iw = iw (0) + idef icit

following these references we rescale the eld by

   x 0, x m  x m,   .

in the   0 limit it is possible to expand the trace over the bosonic coordinates using
the heat kernel expansion [23,24], and the bulk term can easily be rewritten as iw (0) =
lim0 z (n)

[d0] with

z (n)

obtained by dimensional reduction from the d dimensional one. the upshot of the expres-

sion (4.1) is that the overall power of  cancels due to identity of the bosonic transverse
and the fermionic degrees of freedom, so the   0 limit is well dened. in the previous
path integral the integration over the fermion has to be done with periodic boundary con-
dition as enforced by the insertion of the ()f operator in the denition of the index.3 in
3 hereafter, we call this contribution partition function, but one should keep in mind that

the fermion satisfy periodic boundary condition.

the nal expression, we see that we have reduced the model to a zero dimensional matrix
model with an eective coupling constant given by g2

ef f = 42gsl5

s/.

of course, a rigourous computation along the lines of [23,24] or [25], all the elements

of the matrices belonging to the non cartan part of the group have to be included, but

as we will see in the following in putting this model on a two-torus and sending  to zero

before computing the integrals gives the correct answer. we want to use the non-trivial

structure of the orbifold limit of two-dimensional gauge eld theory [19]. when taking this

limit the scaling of the elds is crucial as the important contributions have to come from

xed points of this orbifold space [26]. in our case the relevant scaling can be understood

as follows.

we start from the zero-dimensional model (4.2) and we compactify the coordinates
x 0 and x 9 on a two-torus. rewriting those elds in a fourier transform basis [27]
f t (x 0,d1) = 2l2

sd0,d1 gives

we can now consider the infra-red limit (g2

ef f  ). in this limit the gauge eld
decouples and we have to set to zero the bosonic and fermionic potentials. the existence of
at directions gives rise to a moduli space with an orbifold structure (rd2)n /sn where
the group of permutation sn is the weyl group of u (n ). this way of proceeding is a
convienient way to separate the dynamics of these matrix models, which split naturally in
the dynamics of two of the coordinates, the gauge eld and a x 9 coordinate for the 0 + 1

quantum mechanical models analysed in [17] or for the topological setting of [25].

moreover due to the supersymmetry of the model and the fact that we will subtract

the zero-modes of the elds (see the denition of the measure of (5.1)), the computation will

not suer from any infra-red divergences as the regulator cancels automatically between
the d  2 bosonic coordinates and the n /2 fermionic ones.4 this is intimately linked to
4 with the normalisations of reference [28], the contributions of the bosonic and fermionic

higgs elds cancel; this is in particular independent of the gauge coupling.

10

the underlying gauge symmetry of the problem. a u (n ) matrix model without the gauge

invariance symmetry, has no reason to be free of infra-red divergencies. in the end, we will
be left with a two-dimensional gauge eld theory as we will see in equation (5.5).5

5. the quasi-classical evaluation of the partition function

in order to perform the computation we put the previous matrix model on a two-

dimensional torus, and set ourself in the language of the reduction to two dimensions of

the ten-dimensional super yang-mills theory. we will follow closely the notations and the

logic of [28], except that the yangmills coupling constant will be reintroduced. we will

consider the generalised setting of the model deduced by dimensional reduction from the
d = 3, 4, 6 and 10 u (n ) super yang-mills theories. a subscript [d  d] will indicated the
dimension d of the mother theory and the dimension d of the model under consideration.

the computation will be done after having projected all the elds on the higgs branch,
described by the symmetric orbifold space (rd2)n /sn , and the zero-size limit of the
torus will be taken to get back to the zero-dimensional model of equation (3.1).

the partition function under study is

z(n)

[d2](t , g) =z [da][dx][d] es[d2][a,x,].

with the coupling constant g2
srt /. t-duality relates the radii
to the string coupling gs and the t-dual dilaton  constant by rt gs = rt exp() =

the invariance of the theory under area-preserving dieomorphisms of the two-dimensional
model, every quantity computed in this theory is only function of the parameter rt g2

s/(gs). in the second equality we used the invariance under
area-preserving dieomorphisms to set to zero the value of the t-dual dilaton .6 this

s exp(2  )/ = 42l9

5 the niteness of the matrix integral (4.1) for the u (2) case was shown by the explicit

computations of [21,22,23,24].

projects the computation on the higgs branch of the model. in [28] the eld conguration in
the infra-red limit of the model was worked out. in this limit all matrices f = {da, xi, }
are simultaneously diagonalisable with a unitary matrix v (,  ) such that

f(,  ) = v 1(,  )fd(,  )v (,  )

where fd = diag{f1, ..., fn}. we have therefore

fd(r,  ) = t 1fd(0,  ) t , fd(t, ) = s1fd(0, ) s

where s = v 1(r,  )v (0,  ) and t = v 1(, t )v (, 0). by construction, s t = t s, and
the matrices s and t represent two commuting permutations, s and t, of the diagonal
elements. the permutations are given explicitly as commuting elements s : i  si and

6. contact with threshold corrections

6.1. the heterotic/type i threshold corrections

there is another example where the matrix string setting is helpful to analyse the
conguration of fermionic zero modes, namely the case of the f 4 and r4 terms in the
eective action for the spin(32)/z2 type i theory. the contribution of the complete eec-
tive action for the type i string on r1,7 t 2 consists of perturbative and non-perturbative
terms induced by the wrapped euclidean8 d1-brane on a two-torus included in the d-torus.9

these contributions can be completely evaluated because they are all mapped together to
the one-loop amplitudes of the heterotic string on r1,7  t 2. the non-perturbative part
on the type i side can be written in the compact form as [3,35]

iinst =

in this case the pertinent (t-dual) matrix model is the (8, 0) quantum mechanical model

considered in [36,37,38]

8 this wrapped d1-brane should be euclidean, so a wick rotation on the world-sheet of the
previous two-dimensional model is necessary. the majorana-weyl fermions are now converted to

complex weyl fermions. see [33], for instance, for an explanation how to handle this case.

the coordinates x and  are in the symmetric representation of so(n ), ,  and the
gauge connection a0 are in the anti-symmetric representation. i (i = 1, . . . , 2n ) are in
the real representation (k, 2n ) of so(k) so(2n ). we now put the coordinate  on a
circle of radius l2
s/r, and convert it into a second gauge connection component. we obtain
a two-dimensional gauge model. this model presents several important dierences with

the one studied previously. only the matrices x and  have abelian degrees of freedom.

the gauge coordinates does not have any abelian quantum numbers because the group is

so(k). then the measure for the gauge connection is simply

[da] = da.

we assume10 that we can project the theory on the classical moduli space, m =
(cid:0)r1,7  t 2(cid:1)k
) [40,41,42], and decouple the gauge degree of freedom from

the higgs eld dynamics. as we are only interesting in the measure factor (k), the gauge

eld degrees of freedom are the only ones needed. a computation similar to the one done

in section 5 gives

6.2. the d-instantons

in order to make contact with d-instanton corrections of the action (2.1) of section 2,

it is necessary to specify the normalisations of the matrix model for the d-instanton being

10 the saturation of the fermionic zero-modes does not appears as easily as for the model (5.1).
and the infra-red nitness of the model is not obvious. equivalently, the   0 limit of the bulk

term for the witten index of this type i model is not as trivial as before. but the existence of

a sound limit is linked with the supersymmetry content of the model, and restrict the integral

to be computed. a more rigourous derivation is a little more subtile and is deferred to a future

publication [39].

dierent from those of the gauge theory model of section 5. we identify the u (1) part of

the matrix coordinates with the super-space coordinates of the section 2,

x = tr(cid:18) a
n (cid:19) ,

 = tr(cid:18) 
n(cid:19) .

moreover it is necessary to eliminate the volume of the gauge group v and the partition

it should be remarked that this formula is independent of the string scale ls. depending on

which component of the supereld (2.5) this d-instanton background couples to a dierent
power of n exp() appears, namely w + 1/2 according to (2.2). this can be derived by
explaining how to couple the supergravity eld to the previous matrix model. we have seen

that the computation of the measure factor (n ) can be reduced to the contribution from

the u (1) part of the two-dimensional gauge eld (see equation (5.5)); a feature particularly

dicult to analyse in the zero-dimensional version of the model. the various supergravity

states which appear in the decomposition of the supereld (2.5) are now seen as states of

the abelian part of the matrix model and it is possible to construct them as eigenstates of

the centre of mass hamiltonian [43] by decomposing the representations of so(9) under
so(7)  u (1).11

it is natural to represent the external supergravity states by wilson point observables

states is given by insertions of

ww ilson point = n  exp(cid:18) 1

gs

 + c.c.(cid:19) ,

(6.3)

the term with u (1)b-weight w is now given by a correlation of w + 4 insertions of the

operator ww ilson point where we pick the sixteen-s term. the gauge symmetry xed

the power of the string coupling constant in (6.3) in such way that, the sixteen-s term
is proportional to (n/gs)w+4 which multiplies (6.2). this is exactly what is needed to
reproduce the result of (2.2).

7. discussion

7.1. the large nc limit

the conjecture about the equivalence between the supergravity theory and the super-

conformal yang-mills theory on the boundary space relies heavily on the large-nc limit on

the yang-mills side. here we have only discussed nite-nc computations but we can see

from these that a large-nc limit can be dened. the guideline for this is that we have to

keep a xed number of fermionic zero-modes irrespective to the rank of the gauge group.

if we consider a conguration of k long strings restricted to join to form long strings of

size a multiple of nc but not to split, all the dynamics is embedded in a u (nck) group.

from the previous analysis, of the zero-dimensional model for the d-instantons and the

computation of section 6.2, we deduce that the measure factor for the interactions is (k),

and the factor of nc appear as an overall power. it is now safe to take the large-nc limit

keeping k nite.

if we start from a conguration of elds decomposed as anck

def= ak  inc for a
u (nck) model, the action sdins gets an overall nc factor, so for such a eld conguration

sdins|nck = nc sdins|k

(7.1)

and as we do not get any extra factor of nc from the measure, then

z(nck)
dins = n 7/2

c

z(k)
dins = n 7/2

c

(k)(cid:0)ke(cid:1)7/2

.

(7.2)

the wilson point observables are now given by

ww ilson point = k  exp(cid:18) 1

gs

 + c.c.(cid:19) ,

because the interaction occurs only between long-strings of length a multiple of nc, we do

not get any extra power of nc by inserting them.

(cid:10)(ww ilson point)w+4(cid:11) = n 1/2

c  (1/nc)4  (k)(cid:0)ke(cid:1)7/2+w+4

.

(7.3)

this means that we can take a large-nc limit with the instanton number k xed, in a well-

dened way. this splitting of the elds means that we restrict the integration in the matrix

model to occur only between long strings with length at least nc. this can be made much

more rigourous by embedding a u (k) instanton constructed by giddings, verlinde and

hacquebord [46,47] tensored with the diagonal matrices doing cycles of length nc along
the lines of [48].12 finally, the scaling (7.1) shows that the combination nc2 appears
naturally, as a reminiscence of the scaling 1  n 1/2
of the ads/cft correspondence
[4]. the overall power of  in (7.2) is not correct, due to the lack of being able to derive the

c

relative normalisation with respect to the kinetic einstein-hilbert term of the supergravity

theory.

7.2. d-instantons loop expansion

the fact that we were not able to get the full expansion of the modular form (2.2)

and (2.4) from our matrix model analysis, is certainly due to the fact that we are only

getting the physics of the linearised version of the supergravity theory which gives only the

dominant term in the instantons expansion. this is not a surprising feature, but it would

certainly be worth analysing how much information we can get about these higher order
 corrections by deforming the superspace analysis. we hope to return to this problem

in a future publication.

appendix a. the n = 2 real supercharges case

for the case of n = 2 real supercharges the two-dimensional model (5.2) is composed
by the gauge eld a, and one bosonic higgs x, and its real bi-spinor partner. the only
potential is the one induce by the covariant derivative so it will not be necessary in that

case to take the infra-red limit of the model. the measures are dened as in section 5.

the eld x(,  ) is conjugated to an element in the cartan subalgebra of u (n )

x(,  ) = v 1(,  )x d(,  )v (,  ),

likewise for the fermion due to space-time supersymmetry

(,  ) = v 1(,  )d(,  )v (,  ).

doing the gauge transform

a(,  )  v 1(,  )(cid:16) a(,  ) + (cid:17) v (,  ).

we can now integrate the diagonalized higgs elds. once again, the determinants (without

the zero modes) cancel due to supersymmetry leaving just a constraint on the gauge eld

congurations from the equations of motion of the fermions

the equations of motion for the fermions reads

(a.1)

because the fermions are in the cartan torus [ a, d] = [ an

restricted to the orthogonal (w.r.t. the cartan metric) complementary, n, of the cartan
subalgebra of u(n ). moreover [an

[6 an, d] = 0.
