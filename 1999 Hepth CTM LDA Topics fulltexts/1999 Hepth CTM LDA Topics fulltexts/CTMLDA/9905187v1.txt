i. introduction

the study of induced chern-simons terms in 2 + 1-dimensional eld theory at nite

temperature has produced some interesting new insights [19] into the relationships between

large gauge invariance, eective actions and induced charges at nite temperature. the

simplest example of an induced chern-simons term arises in the computation of the one-

fermion-loop gauge self-energy in qed3. the chern-simons coecient is extracted from

the zero-momentum limit of the parity violating part of this self-energy [10]. at nite t, this

procedure is not unique [11] since feynman diagrams are not analytic in external momenta at

nite temperature [12]. this is because the thermal heat bath breaks lorentz invariance, so

that diagrams depend separately on the energy p0 and the spatial momentum ~p. in a static
limit, with p0 = 0 and |~p|  0, an induced chern-simons term is found with a temperature
dependent coecient [1315]. as rst pointed out in [16], this result appears (when carried

over to a nonabelian theory) to violate large gauge invariance since the coecient of the

induced chern-simons term in a nonabelian theory should take discrete values [17]. this

puzzle has been resolved for the cases when the background has the character of a static

magnetic eld with integer ux  (as is appropriate for comparison with the static limit),

because in this case the problem factorizes into  copies of an exactly solvable 0 + 1-

dimensional model [13]. then one nds that the nite temperature eective action has an

innite series of parity-violating terms (of which the chern-simons term is only the rst),

each of which has a t dependent coecient at nite t. nevertheless, the series is such

that the full eective action changes under a large gauge transformation in a manner that

is independent of t. these new parity-violating terms are non-extensive (i.e., they are not

integrals of a density) and they explicitly vanish at zero temperature (as they must since

the zero t eective action should be extensive). this issue is considerably more dicult

to resolve in genuinely time-dependent backgrounds, although presumably it should be true

that the full nite t eective action is invariant under large gauge transformations that have

2

non-zero winding number. 1

with this as motivation, we propose here to study an extreme non-static limit of 2 + 1-

dimensional qed obtained by making a dimensional reduction so that all elds are spatially
uniform (i.e. ~p = 0), but time dependent (p0 6= 0). this dimensional reduction leads to a 0+
1-dimensional eld theory (i.e. quantum mechanics) that inherits many of the features of the

2+1-dimensional model, such as chern-simons terms, time-reversal violation, an analogue of

parity violation, and global u(2) avor symmetry [18]. however, this dimensionally reduced

0 + 1-dimensional model is very dierent from the 0 + 1 model considered in [1]. rather,

our dimensionally reduced model is very similar to chern-simons quantum mechanics [19],

but now coupled to spinor elds. surprisingly, we nd that the interactions induce a chern-

simons terms at nite t, and from the self-energy diagram we nd a coecient tanh( mf

2 ),

where mf is the fermion mass, just as in 2 + 1 dimensions. moreover, the scalar elds are

now dynamical and so it is possible to go beyond the one-loop level. however, the analogy

with qed3 is not perfect; for example, by suppressing all spatial uctuation degrees of

freedom we have lost local gauge invariance - instead we are left with a type of yukawa

model. nevertheless, the model displays a remarkably rich renormalization structure, at

both zero and non-zero temperature.

in section ii we introduce the dimensionally reduced model and its symmetry properties.

in section iii we calculate the exact one-fermion-loop scalar eective action for the special

case where there are no t violating bare masses. section iv introduces the nite temperature
propagators, and in sections v and vi we compute the one-loop scalar self-energy and

multi-leg diagrams contributing to the eective action. in section vii we calculate the one-

1note that the large gauge transformations considered in the static cases have zero winding

number; they shift the chern-simons action by a constant because of the total derivative term

in the change of the chern-simons lagrange density, not because of the winding number density

term [21].

contains some concluding remarks.

ii. dimensionally reduced model

consider the 2 + 1 dimensional lagrange density for quantum electrodynamics together

with a chern-simons term:

l2+1(~x, t) =

here, the electric and magnetic elds are ei = fi0 = ia0  ai, and b = f12 = ijiaj,
respectively, and  = 

 is a two-component complex spinor eld. the dirac matrices

2 aa break
note that both the fermion mass term mf
the discrete symmetries of parity p and time reversal t in 2 + 1 dimensions [17,20,21].
furthermore, as is well known, a chern-simons term for the gauge eld can be induced

 and the chern-simons term 

radiatively at zero temperature, as the one-fermion loop gauge self-energy acquires a p-odd
and t -odd contribution [10]. at nite temperature this calculation is more complicated, as
was discussed in the introduction.

now consider a dimensional reduction of the model described by the lagrange density

(1), dened by taking all elds to be spatially constant. in other words, all momenta ~p are

set equal to zero. this reduces to a lagrangian for a 0 + 1 dimensional model :

l(t) =

1
2

a2

i +


2

ij aiaj + i 00  mf  +  + e iai

(3)

in this spatially constant limit, the non-dynamical eld ea0 reduces to a constant chemical

potential . the vector potential ~a becomes a pair of scalar elds ai = ai(t), with a

4

lorentz-force term 

2 ij aiaj inherited from the chern-simons mass term, and a yukawa

interaction e iai with the two-component spinor  = (t).

the dimensionally reduced system with lagrangian (3) retains some interesting symme-

try properties. the rst is a global rotational invariance, with innitesimal transformations

ai  ai + ijaj,

  (1 + i


2

0)

(4)

where  is constant. this clearly leaves each term in the lagrangian (3) invariant.

the 0 + 1-dimensional model in (3) possesses remnants of the behavior of the qed3

lagrangian (1) under discrete symmetries [20,21]. time reversal acts as

t :   2,

t : ai  ai

(5)

this leaves invariant the chemical potential term , but changes the sign of the mass
term . similarly, the chern-simons term ij aiaj changes sign under t . the yukawa
interaction term remains invariant (recall that t is an antiunitary operation, for which
i  i). all these properties mirror exactly the behavior of the 2 + 1 model.

the 0 + 1 model also inherits a charge conjugation symmetry from the 2 + 1 model:

c :   c = 20 = 



2


1


 ,

c : ai  ai

(6)

under this generalized charge conjugation operation c, the chemical potential term 
changes sign, while the mass term  is invariant (recall that the  are anticommuting

fermi elds). finally, this model also inherits another discrete symmetry, which we still call

parity (although there is no spatial reection involved), from the parity symmetry of the

2 + 1 model:

p :   1,

p : a1  a1,

p : a2  a2

(7)

this symmetry is broken by the fermion mass term  and the chern-simons term ij aiaj,

but not by the chemical potential term .

we can also identify a global u(2) avor symmetry of the model (3), in analogy to the

situation in 2 + 1 dimensions [20,22]. the irreducible dirac matrix in 0 + 1 dimensions

5

is just a number: 0 = 1. but by reducing from 2 + 1 we have eectively doubled the

fermionic degrees of freedom (so that we can interpret 1 and 2 as two avors) and dened

1

0

a reducible dirac matrix 0 = 
. there then exist two other 2  2 matrices that

anticommute with 0, and taken together the set {0, i1, i2, 1} generates a global u(2)
avor symmetry. this is exactly analogous to the situation in 2 + 1 dimensions where we

0 1

can double the degrees of freedom taking reducible 4  4 dirac matrices and two fermion
avors [20].

this global avor symmetry acts on the elds as (innitesimally)

  (1 + ~  ~),

ai  ai + ijj

(8)

this avor symmetry is broken u(2)  u(1)  u(1) by the fermion mass term , but is
preserved by the chemical potential term . once again, this mimics the behavior of the

2 + 1 dimensional model.

iii. exact one-loop effective action

in the absence of the bare t -violating mass terms  and ij aiaj, it is possible to
compute the exact nite temperature one-fermion-loop eective action for the scalar elds

ai(t). note that the background ai(t) is manifestly non-static. in this section we consider

the bare lagrangian (obtained from (3) by setting mf = 0 and  = 0)

l0 =

1
2

a2

i + i 00 +  + e iai

integrating out the fermion elds, the one-loop eective action is

[ai] = i log"det(i0 +  + e0iai)

det(i0 + )

#

we can simplify the evaluation of [ai] by the following nonlinear eld redenition:

   = exp(cid:18)iez t

dt0iai(cid:19) 

6

(9)

(10)

(11)

then the lagrangian simplies to a free lagrangian l = 1
2

a2

i +

0(i0 + ) . at nite

temperature, if we work in the imaginary time formalism, the original fermion elds satisfy
antiperiodic boundary conditions: () = (0), where  = 1
therefore, the transformed elds  have boundary conditions:
dt0iai! (0)

t is the inverse temperature.

() =  exp iez 

(12)

0

this boundary condition may be imposed, for a given background ai(t), by using a chemical

potential  = i e

 0iai where

ai = z 

0

dtai(t)

(13)

thus, the evaluation of the eective action (10) reduces to the evaluation of the logarithm

of the determinant of the operator

i0 +  +  = 


i0 +   e
e
 a+

 a

i0 + 


with anti-periodic boundary conditions. here we have introduced a convenient shorthand

notation a = a1  ia2. it is a straightforward matter to diagonalize this operator by a
unitary transformation u:

having the operator in this simple diagonal form, we can now use the results of [1] to evaluate

several comments are in order concerning the result (16). first, notice that there is

no sign of any t -violating terms being generated. this is not surprising, since the bare
lagrangian (9) considered in this section contains neither a fermion mass term nor a chern-

simons term. second, this nite temperature eective action involves non-extensive terms,

as had also been found in the nite temperature static limit [1,6]. in fact, the result (16)

where the eective action must be extensive, the eective action vanishes, by a cancellation

0 dtai(t). at zero temperature,

can be expanded as a series in even powers of the integral r 
of extensive terms r 

0 dtai(t) with opposite signs.

iv. finite temperature perturbation theory

while it is interesting to observe the presence of non-extensive terms in the nite temper-

ature eective action for the t -preserving lagrangian (9), it is more interesting to consider
the possibility of the radiative generation of t -violating terms at nite temperature. we ex-
pect that this phenomenon may occur if we include the t -violating bare masses mf and/or
 that appear in the lagrangian (3). but the eective action for this system is not exactly

solvable. thus we must resort to nite temperature perturbation theory [23]. since we

are considering non-static backgrounds ai = ai(t) it is more direct to use the real-time

formalism. we will present the calculations in both coordinate space and in momentum

space.

the nite t propagators simplify considerably in 0 + 1 dimensions, due to the simplicity

of the dispersion relation. for the fermion elds, the quadratic lagrangian

quad = i 00  mf 
lf

(17)

leads to the following thermal real-time propagators (we are using the closed time path

formalism [23]):

v. one-fermion-loop scalar self-energy

given the nite t propagators from the previous section, we now compute the one-

fermion-loop self-energy for the scalar elds ai. we present the calculation both in momen-

tum space and in coordinate space.

a. momentum space calculation

the momentum space scalar self-energy with thermal indices a, b (each taking possible

values ) in figure 1 is (this denition includes a negative sign inherent in the denition of
 in the closed time path formalism [23])

ij

ab(p) = (ie)2z dq

 j = 


(ij + iij)d

(ij  iij)c

(25)

(26)

thus we see that the self-energy naturally separates into a piece proportional to ij and a

piece proportional to ij. we rst consider the ++ thermal self-energy:

ij

++(p) = e2(ij z dq

2

s11

++(q, mf )hs22

++(q + p, mf ) + s22

++(q  p, mf )i

iij z dq

2

s11

++(q, mf )hs22

++(q + p, mf )  s22

++(q  p, mf )i)

(27)

here the upper indices 11 and 22 refer to the diagonal components of the dirac matrix

structure of the fermionic propagators in (18), and we have used the fact that s22

++(q, mf ) =
++(p) that is proportional to ij is manifestly even

++(q, mf ). notice that the part of ij
s11

in p, while the part proportional to ij is odd in p. the loop momentum integrals are

straightforward contour integrals, and we nd the remarkably simple structure for the self-

energy

ij
++(p) = e2 tanh(
= e2 tanh(

mf

2

mf

2

)h4mf ij  2ipiji 
i
p2  4m2
)h4mf ij  2ipiji g++(p, 2mf )

f + i

to obtain this result we have used the identities:

(p  2mf ) + (p + 2mf ) = 4mf (p2  4m2
f )
(p  2mf )  (p + 2mf ) = 2p(p2  4m2
f )

furthermore, the tanh( mf

2 ) factor arises because of the identity

[nf (mf )]2 = tanh(

mf

2

) nb(2mf )

+ 2nb(2mf )(p2  4m2

f )!

(28)

(29)

(30)

the result (28) is interesting for a number of reasons. first, notice the appearance of a

chern-simons-like ij part to the scalar self-energy. furthermore, notice that the overall

factor tanh( mf

2 ) that is familiar from the computation of induced chern-simons terms at

nite temperature in 2 + 1 dimensional theories in the static limit [13,14]. indeed, in the

small p limit,

ij +

e2

(31)

11

which shows that at one-loop order we induce both an even and odd mass term for the

scalars ai.

it is also interesting to note that the full p dependence of the self-energy combines into a

bosonic propagator, for a bosonic eld of mass 2mf , even though the actual calculation of the

fermion loop only involves fermionic propagators. we also comment that if this calculation

is repeated including also a chemical potential term  for the fermions, then the only

dierence in the nal result is that

tanh(

mf

2

)

becomes

sinh(mf )

cosh(mf ) + cosh()

which arises because of the identity

nf (mf + )nf (mf  ) =  

sinh(mf )

cosh(mf ) + cosh()! nb(2mf )

(32)

(33)

this modied prefactor is precisely the chern-simons prefactor found in the static limit

nite temperature calculation in 2 + 1 dimensions with both a fermion mass mf and a

chemical potential  [15].

this momentum space calculation can be done similarly for the other thermal compo-

nents of the self-energy, with the general result that

ij
ab(p) = e2 tanh(

mf

2

)h4mf ij  2ipiji gab(p, 2mf )

(34)

where, as stated before, this denition includes a negative sign inherent in the denition of

 in the closed time path formalism [23].

b. coordinate space calculation

the one-fermion-loop scalar self-energy is even easier to compute in coordinate space

(see figure 2) as no integration is involved - it is simply a matter of multiplying out the

various coordinate space propagators. thus, for the ++ thermal component one nds

12

ij

++(t1  t2) = (ie)2tr(cid:16)is++(t1  t2, mf )js++(t2  t1, mf )(cid:17)
= e2nijh((t2  t1)  nf (mf ))2e2imf (t1t2) + ((t1  t2)  nf (mf ))2e2imf (t1t2)i

+iij h((t2  t1)  nf (mf ))2e2imf (t1t2)  ((t1  t2)  nf (mf ))2e2imf (t1t2)io (35)

as before, we recognize a term proportional to ij and a term proportional to ij. the former

is even under the interchange of t1 and t2, while the latter is odd under this interchange.

the products of propagators may be expanded using the identity

((t)  nf (mf ))2 = tanh(

mf

2

) ((t) + nb(2mf ))

(36)

thus, we see immediately that

ij
++(t1  t2) = e2 tanh(

mf

2

)"4mf ij + 2ij 

t1# g++(t1  t2, 2mf )

(37)

which is simply the coordinate space version of the result (28). the other thermal compo-

nents are computed similarly, so that

ij
ab(t1  t2) = e2 tanh(

mf

2

)"4mf ij + 2ij 

t1# gab(t1  t2, 2mf )

(38)

in agreement with the momentum space result (34).

vi. one-loop effective action

for the model with a fermion mass term mf , it is not possible to compute the one-

loop eective action in closed form. nevertheless, a perturbative analysis is possible. the

eective action has the standard diagrammatic expansion shown in figure 3.

it is clear

that the tadpole term vanishes because of the trace property tr(is(q, mf )) = 0, since i

is o-diagonal and s is diagonal. for this same reason, each diagram with an odd number

of external scalar lines vanishes identically. (this is analogous to furrys theorem). beyond

the self-energy diagram, which was computed in the previous section, the next is the four-

leg diagram. as noted for the self-energy, it is easiest to do these one-loop calculations in

13

coordinate space since there are no integrations involved. for example, the 4-leg diagram in

figure 4 yields

ijkl

++++(t1, t2, t3, t4) = (ie)4tr(cid:16)is++(t1  t4)ls++(t4  t3)ks++(t3  t2)js++(t2  t1)(cid:17)

(39)

adding the other permutations of the external coordinates, the quartic contribution to the

eective action can be written as squartic = r dt1dt2dt3dt4g(4)(t1, t2, t3, t4) where

where we have dened a = a1 + ia2 and a = a1  ia2.

the structure is similar for the 2n-point function, for which we nd

notice that this contribution to the eective action involves non-extensive terms, al-

though the zero t limit is extensive as the 2n-point function reduces to products of theta

functions. also, it is interesting to note that this nite t eective action is considerably

more complicated than the situation with a static background, for which it is possible to

nd the exact p-odd part of the eective action [13]. here, in a non-static limit, it does
not appear possible to nd such an exact closed-form expression.

vii. one-loop fermion self-energy

a. momentum space calculation

the one-loop fermion self-energy in figure 5 takes an interesting simple form at nite

temperature. in momentum space it is straightforward to perform the single loop integral

to show that

here we have used the identities (we assume the scalar regulator mass mb is smaller than

the fermionic mass mf )

it is interesting to notice that the result (42) says that the eect of the scalar loop is

essentially to split the bare fermion (of mass mf ) into two fermions, of masses mf  mb,
2 )(cid:17) respectively. this, in turn, makes higher-

loop calculations easier, since a self-energy insertion is simply like an insertion of a modied

propagator.

b. coordinate space calculation

the same result is found in coordinate space. for example, the ++ thermal component

of the fermion self-energy is simply found by multiplying out the following propagators

(44)

((t)  nf (mf ))((t) + nb(mb)) = (1 + nb(mb)  nf (mf ))((t)  nf (mf + mb))
((t)  nf (mf ))((t) + nb(mb)) = (nb(mb) + nf (mf ))((t)  nf (mf  mb))
the analogous results hold for the other thermal indices of the fermion self-energy.

(45)

viii. two-loop results

the simple structure of the nite temperature one-loop scalar and fermion self-energies

found in the preceding sections suggests that higher loop calculations should be relatively

straightforward also. as an example of the continued simplicity, consider the one-loop

vertex correction in figure 7. this one-loop vertex correction vanishes identically due to

dirac matrix algebra since it involves the matrix structure

i


0

d 0


 i = 0

(46)

this has the immediate consequence that the crossed two-loop scalar self-energy diagram

in figure 8(b) vanishes, and so we only need to consider the diagram in figure 8(a). to

compute the contribution for the external ++ thermal indices, we need four such diagrams,

as shown in figure 9, since the internal vertices can each have one of two thermal indices

a = . so

but we have already computed part of this, in evaluating the one-loop fermion self-energy

 in the previous section. from the result (44) we see that  splits into a contribution

proportional to (1 + nb(mb)  nf (mf )) and a contribution proportional to (nb(mb) +
nf (mf )). therefore, the combination ss, which appears in the two-loop calculation, also

splits in this manner. these two contributions are simply related by taking (mf + mb)

to (mf  mb). furthermore, the product ss is diagonal in the dirac matrix sense, and
the two diagonal entries are simply related by interchanging the coordinate labels. so it is

sucient to look rst at the piece of the (11) dirac matrix component that is multiplied by

(1 + nb(mb)  nf (mf )):
 (ie)2xa,b

(s+a(t1  t3)ab(t3  t4)sb+(t4  t2))(11) =

 (1  nf (mf + mb)) (1  nf (mf ))}

+nf (mf ) {(nf (mf + mb)) ((t4  t2)  nf (mf ))

 ((t3  t4)  nf (mf + mb)) (1  nf (mf ))}]

(48)

after some straightforward algebra, this reduces to

(1 + nb(mb)  nf (mf ))eimf (t1t2)ei(mb +2mf )(t3t4)

e4
mb
 [(t2  t4)(t4  t3)(t3  t1) + nf (mf + mb)(t1  t3)(t2  t4)
(1  nf (mf )) ((t1  t3)(t3  t4) + (t2  t4)(t4  t3))]

(49)

inserting this into the two-loop self-energy (47) requires performing the integrals over the

internal vertex coordinates t3 and t4. as can be seen from (49), there are three types of

integrals, and they require some care since they involve products of theta functions. using

the representation

(t) = z

together with careful regularization of delta functions, we nd

the analogous term proprtional to (nb(mb) + nf (mf )) is obtained by replacing mf + mb

with mf  mb. and then the (22) dirac matrix components are obtained by interchanging
t1 and t2.

finally, to evaluate the two-loop scalar self-energy (47), we insert the remaining gamma

matrices and the propagator s++(t2  t1), and perform the dirac trace. the net result is

note the appearance of terms proportional to ij that are even under the interchange
t1  t2, as well as the chern-simons terms proportional to ij that are odd under the
interchange t1  t2. it is also interesting to observe the new structure involving factors
of (t1  t2) multiplying propagators. the result (55) is non-zero even at zero temperature.
this should be compared and contrasted to the case in 2 + 1 dimensional qed at zero

temperature, where the parity-odd two-loop contribution to the gauge self-energy vanishes

[24,25]. here this is not the case, a reection of the fact that our dimensionally reduced

model does not have local gauge invariance.

we have also computed the two-loop fermion self-energy, but the nal expression is long

and we do not present it here. note that because of the vanishing of the one-loop vertex

correction, the overlapping diagram in figure 10(b) is identically zero. the remaining two

diagrams in figure 10 are straightforward to evaluate given the one-loop results already

presented.

finally we mention that while the one-loop vertex correction (see figure 7) is zero, at

the two-loop level there is in fact one non-zero vertex diagram, shown in figure 11. all

other two-loop vertex diagrams vanish.

ix. conclusions

in this paper we have studied an extreme non-static limit of 2 + 1-dimensional qed

obtained by making a dimensional reduction so that all elds are spatially uniform (i.e.
~p = 0), but time dependent (p0 6= 0). the resulting 0 + 1-dimensional eld theory inherits
many of the features of qed3, such as chern-simons terms, time-reversal violation, an

analogue of parity violation, and global u(2) avor symmetry. we found that at nite

19

temperature the interactions induce a radiative chern-simons mass as well as a t -even
mass, and from the self-energy diagram we nd that each is proportional to tanh( mf
2 ),

where mf is the fermion mass. multi-leg diagrams contain non-extensive contributions at

nite t, but it does not appear possible to re-sum exactly the eective action, except in the

special case in which there are no bare t -violating masses to begin with. this is indicative
of the diculty of analyzing the nite temperature 2 + 1 model in non-static backgrounds.

we have computed the two loop scalar and fermion self-energies, and we nd that these

are non-zero. indeed, they are even non-zero at zero temperature. this does not violate

the coleman-hill theorem [25] since in our non-static limit we have suppressed local gauge

invariance. it would be interesting to study supersymmetry breaking due to temperature

eects in this model - the model itself is not supersymmetric, but could be made so by the

suitable inclusion of additional elds.
