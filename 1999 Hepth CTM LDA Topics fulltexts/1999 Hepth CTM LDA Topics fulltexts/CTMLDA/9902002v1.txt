we evaluate the fermionic determinant for massless qed2 at nite
temperature, in the imaginary time formalism. by using a decoupling
transformation of the fermionic elds, we show that the determinant
factorizes into the usual, temperature independent expression, times
an extra factor which depends on the temperature and on the constant
component of the gauge eld.

recent results on the nite temperature eective action for fermions in
a gauge eld background a in 0 + 1 [1]-[3], 2 + 1 [4]-[12], 1 + 1 [13] and
d + 1 [14] dimensions have revealed new and interesting features, showing in
particular that sef f [a] can be a non-extensive quantity depending on a in
a non-polynomial way.

in the present note we reconsider the 1 + 1 case, that is, we analyse
the eective action for the massless schwinger model at nite temperature,
following a covariant approach based in the introduction of a heat-bath ve-
locity u [15]. in fact, the fermion determinant for two dimensional massless
fermions in a gauge eld background has been computed using dierent tech-
niques both for topologically trivial and non trivial backgrounds (where zero
modes have to be carefully handled) [16]-[22]. here, we want to clarify, in
connection with the results of [13], the way in which the heat bath velocity
can be connected with non-trivial boundary conditions leading to a result
which is related to that obtained in [21] in the analysis of the fermion de-
terminant considering zero modes in the various topological sectors. as we
shall see, taking into account the heat-bath velocity is tantamount to consid-
ering a constant gauge eld background (or, equivalently, twisted boundary
conditions for the fermions and no constant background). we will nd that
there is a contribution to the fermion determinant which depends on u, this
showing that in general the schwinger model eective action is not a trivial
extension of the zero temperature one.

we shall begin by dealing with z[a], the two dimensional fermionic de-
terminant in the presence of an abelian u(1) gauge eld in the imaginary
time formalism

z[a] = det[i/ + ie 6a] = z d d exphsf ( , ; a)i

where the action functional sf is given by

sf [ , ; a] = z 

0

d z dx (, x)[6  + ie 6a(, x)](, x)

(1)

(2)

where  denotes the imaginary time, x the (sole) space coordinate, and
 = 1
t . spacetime is euclidean, and the elds obey the standard bound-
ary conditions at t > 0

a(, x) = a(0, x) x  = 1, 2 ,

2

(, x) = (0, x) , (, x) =  (0, x) x .

(3)

it is a well established result [16]-[22] that at nite temperature this
fermionic determinant is formally identical to the zero temperature one, but
only if the (often non suciently emphasized) assumption is made that the
external gauge eld is topologically trivial in the sense that its holonomy
around the periodic time coordinate is trivial. we shall show that relaxing
this assumption leads to a more general answer. moreover, it should of course
lead to the usual result when the same kind of conguration is considered.

we shall decompose the external gauge eld a as follows

a =

1
e

( + i) .

(4)

it follows from eq.(4) that the scalar elds  and  satisfy the equations

2 = e   a 2 = ie a .

(5)

it must be noted that equations (5) only determine the elds  and  up

to a solution of laplace equation. namely,

(, x) = (0)(, x) + (, x)
(, x) = (0)(, x) + (, x)

with

2(0)(, x) = 0 , 2(0)(, x) = 0

(6)

(7)

and ,  particular solutions of (5).

the new, non trivial, part of a, playing a central role in our calculation,
may be thought of as coming from (0) and (0): indeed, at t = 0 there is
no reason to inlude non-trivial solutions of the laplace equations, since the
spacetime manifold is trivial, and a regular solution is necessarily a constant
(giving no contribution to a). of course, poincare invariance also forbids the
imposition of any non trivial boundary condition at innity. on the other
hand, at nite temperature the topology of spacetime is the one of a cylinder,
and moreover there is no poincare invariance. the partition function of a
system, in the canonical ensemble say, is dened in terms of the hamiltonian,
a non-covariant object. moreover, the denition of this ensemble implicitly
assumes the existence of a preferential reference frame, the one where the

3

thermal bath is at rest with respect to the system. when there is relative
motion between the system and the bath, we should expect the results to
depend not only on the energy, but also on the other available integrals of
motion of the system: for example its momentum [23], which is simply related
to the velocity 1.

this implies that we may now write the general solutions to (7) using
a constant vector, the velocity u with respect to the bath. it is not hard
to realize that the most general solution (compatible with the periodicity of
a in the time direction) is a linear function of the coordinates. the only
available vector coecient to build up a scalar is something proportional to
u:

(0) = a ux , (0) = b ux

(8)

where a and b are constants. the relation between the coecients a and b
and a is determined by the equations

a(0)

 =

1
e

(a u + i b u)  = 0, 1 ,

(9)

where a(0)
gauge eld.

 denotes the zero momentum (i.e., constant) component of the

with this remark in mind, we see the gauge eld a appearing in the

fermionic determinant is of the form

where

a = a(0)

 + a

a =

1
e

(  + i ) .

(10)

(11)

of course, a has no zero momentum component, and in consequence the
scalar elds  and  are strictly periodic in the time coordinate  . it should
be noted that the new part of the gauge eld we are including in this study
is, in fourier space, proportional to a delta function of euclidean momentum.
this suggests a connection with the perturbative study by das et al in real
time, where the extra piece found in the eective action has support for
k2 = 0. this support, when mapped to euclidean spacetime, becomes k = 0.

1as the total fermionic charge is conserved, one may also introduce the total current.

the a part of the gauge eld may be entirely decoupled by the anomalous

jacobian method, just by noting that

sf ( , ; a) = z 

0

d z dx (, x)eie( 5 )(6  + ie 6 a(0))eie( +5 )(, x)

(12)

and dening the new fermionic elds

then, one can write

 = exp (ie(  + 5)) 
 =  exp (ie(   5))

z(a) = j(a(0), a)  z(a(0))

(13)

(14)

where j(a(0), a) denotes the anomalous jacobian for the transformation (13).
eq.(14) represents one of the main steps in our calculation: we have man-
aged to factorize the fermion determinant into one factor which corresponds
to the usual jacobian leading, as we shall see, to the usual schwinger deter-
minant but in a domain (0, l)  (0, ), times a determinant in a constant
background which is in fact related to the velocity u with respect to the bath.
(for the sake of generality we also assume that the space like coordinate is
nite, with length l, and the fermions are periodic in this direction.this
shall also be important when considering the thermodynamic limit).

now we shall show that j is actually independent of a(0) , what makes it
identical to the standard, zero temperature like result (with the imaginary
time integral in the domain (0, )). to show this property we only have
to realize that the jacobian for an innitesimal axial transformation is in-
dependent of a(0), since the nite transformation is built as an iteration of
innitesimal ones. the innitesimal axial transformation

   + i5 ,    + i 5 ,

induces a jacobian

with

j = exp[ia]

a = tr[5]

(15)

(16)

(17)

where the trace is meant to be on dirac indices, as well as on functional
space. as usual, to make sense of a, we dene it as the limit of a regularized

5

expression:

a = lim
m 

tr[5f (

/d2
m 2 )]

where f is a function that veries

f (0) = 1 , f () = f () =    = 0 .

(18)

(19)

now we write the trace in terms of eigenstates of the free dirac operator,
which are free spinors, with a discrete time component for the momentum

a = lim
m 

tr( 1

 xn z dk

2

hn, k|[5f (

/d2

m 2 )]|n, ki ) .

(20)

the sum over n can be put as an integral over a continuum momentum,
plus a temperature dependent term which picks up contributions from the
single poles of f . we shall assume that f is a meromorphic function with
no singularities on the real axis. the temperature dependent term obviously
vanishes in the limit m  , since there is one integration over momentum
less than required to give a non-zero contribution.
indeed, this is what
happens in the usual proof of the temperature independence of the anomaly.
thus we are lead to an expression like (20) but with a double integral rather
that a sum and an integral. yet it is not indentical to the zero temperature
jacobian, since /d2 depends on the constant component of a,

/d2 = d2(a) +

ie
4

[, ]f( a)

(21)

where the only dependence on a(0) comes from d2(a). but this dependence
is erased by a simple shift of the (now continuous) timelike momentum, thus
the jacobian is independent of a(0).

after some standard calculation, we then have from eqs.(16)-(21)

j[a(0), a] = exp 

with  given by

there only remains to evaluate the constant eld determinant

z(a(0)) = det[6  + ie 6 a(0)] .

(22)

(23)

(24)

it is immediate to realize that, as the fermions are massless, the deter-
minant can be factorized into two constant eld determinants, one for each
chirality

z(a(0)) = det(d0 + id1) det(d0  id1) exp(q) ,

(25)

where q is a counterterm which can be identied with the non holomorphic
residue [24]. each one of the chiral determinants can be exactly calculated
following for example the technique described in this last reference so that
one arrives to the result

z(a(0)) = exp[(a(0))] ,

where the jacobi theta function  may be dened by a single series repre-
sentation

the rst term in the r.h.s. of eq.(27) corresponds to the product of holo-
morphic and antiholomorphic factors arising in the computation of chiral
determinants in a constant background. the second term is just q and repre-
sents the obstruction to holomorphic factorization. it can be computed just
by demanding the complete determinant to be gauge-invariant.

we then have, putting together (22) and (27) that z(a) as given by (14)

which is our main result. it is worth emphasizing a nontrivial property sat-
ised by this expression, namely, that the contributions coming from topo-
logical (non-zero constant eld component) and non-topological gauge eld
congurations are neatly decoupled. this is in fact a consequence of the
independence of the chiral anomaly on the long distance properties of the
system. this decoupling is in fact also observed in the real time formulation
calculation presented in ([13]), where one sees that the dierence between
the result presented therein and the usual is non-vanishing only for gauge
elds having support on the light cone.

we note that to nd the explicit form of relation (9) would require the
calculation, for example, of the expectation value of the total momentum as
a function of a.
