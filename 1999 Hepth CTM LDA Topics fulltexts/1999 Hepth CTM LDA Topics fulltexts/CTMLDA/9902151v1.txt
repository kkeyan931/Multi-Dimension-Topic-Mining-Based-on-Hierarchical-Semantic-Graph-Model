form factors in ocritical superconformal models

g. mussardo 

december 23, 2013

abstract

we discuss the determination of the lowest form factors relative to the trace
operators of n = 1 super sinh-gordon model. analytic continuations of these
form factors as functions of the coupling constant allows us to study a series of
models in a uniform way, among these the latest model of the roaming series and
a class of minimal supersymmetric models.

introduction

a full control of a quantum field theory (qft) is reached once the complete
set of correlation functions of its elds is known. perturbation theory often proves
to be an inadequate approach to this problem therefore more eective and powerful
methods need to be developed. in this respect, one of the most promising methods
is the form factor approach which is applicable to integrable models [1, 2]. this
consists in computing exactly all matrix elements of the quantum elds and then
using them to obtain the spectral representations of the correlators.
in addition
to the rich and interesting mathematical structure presented by the form factors
themselves (which has been investigated in a series of papers, among which [2-11],
the resulting spectral series usually show a remarkable convergent behaviour which
allows approximation of the correlators (or quantities related to them) within any
desired accuracy [11-17].

in this talk, based on the original paper [3], i will briey discuss some new
results obtained for those qft which are invariant under a supersymmetry trans-
formation which mixes the elementary bosonic and fermionic excitations. namely,
i will present the result relative to the lowest form factors of the super sinh-
gordon theory (sshg) and of those models which can be obtained by its analytic
continuations.
in these models, the degeneracy of the spectrum dictated by the
supersymmetry implies the existence of multichannel scattering processes and the
resulting s-matrix is necessarily nondiagonal.
in this case, the complete deter-
mination of the matrix elements of the quantum elds for an arbitrary number of
asymptotic particles is still an open problem.
the sshg and superconformal models

scattering theories of integrable super-symmetric theories have been discussed in
detail in schoutenss paper [18] (see also [19]). we refer to these papers and also to

[3] for a general discussion of the features of these theories and the relative notation.
let us concentrate then our attention to the main subjects of this talk, i.e. the super
sinh-gordon model and the integrable deformations of the superconformal models.
in the euclidean space, the super sinh-gordon model can be dened in terms of its
action

a =z d2zd2(cid:20) 1

2

dd + i

m

2 cosh (cid:21) ,

where the covariant derivatives are dened as d =    z; d =    z, and the
supereld (z, z, , ) has an expansion as

(z, z, , ) = (z, z) + (z, z) +  (z, z) +  f(z, z) .

(2)

the integration on the  variables and also the elimination of the auxiliary eld
f(z, z) by means of its algebraic equation of motion leads to the lagrangian

l =

1
2

(zz + z + z) +

m2
22 sinh2  + im cosh  .

(3)

of all the dierent ways of looking at the sshg model, one of the most conve-
nient is to consider it as a deformation of the superconformal model described by
the action

(1)

(4)

a =

1

2z (zz + z + z) .

this superconformal model has central charge c = 3/2. at this point, it is useful to
briey remind some properties of the superconformal models and their deformations.
for a generic superconformal model, the supersymmetric charges can be repre-
sented by the dierential operators q =  +  z; q =  +  z. the analytic part
of the stress-energy tensor t (z) and the current g(z) which generates the supersym-
metry combine themselves into the analytic supereld w (z, ) = g(z) + t (z) ,,
which is called the super stress-energy tensor. for the anti-analytic sector we have
correspondingly w (z) = g(z) +  t (z). these elds are mapped one into the other
by means of the super-charges. as it is well known [23], reducible unitary represen-
tations of the n = 1 superconformal symmetry occurs for the discrete values of the
central charge

c =

3
2 

12

m(m + 2)

.

(5)

at these values, realizations of the n = 1 superconformal algebra are given in
terms of a nite number of superelds in the neveu-scwartz sector and a nite
number of ordinary conformal primary elds in the ramond sector. their conformal
dimensions are given by

p,q =

[(m + 2)p  mq]2  4

8m(m + 2)

+

1
32

[1  (1)pq] ,

(6)

where p q even corresponds to the primary neveu-schwartz superelds n (m)
and pq odd to the primary ramond elds r(m)
superconformal minimal models smm.
the witten index t r(1)f of the superconformal models can be computed
by initially dening them on a cylinder [24]: the hamiltonian on the cylinder is

p,q (z, )
p,q (z). these elds enter the so-called

2

given by h = q2 = l0  c/24, where as usual c/24 is the casimir energy on the
cylinder and l0 = 1
2ih dzzt (z). considering that for any conformal state | ai with
 > c/24 there is the companion state q | ai of opposite fermionic parity, their
contributions cancel each other in t r(1)f and therefore only the ground states
with  = c/24 (which are not necessarily paired) enter the nal expression of the
witten index. for the minimal models, there is a non-zero witten index only for m
even. therefore the lowest superconformal minimal model with a non-zero witten
index is the one with m = 4, which has a central charge c = 1 and corresponds
to the class of universality of the critical ashkin-teller model. the superconformal
theory with c = 3/2 made of free bosonic and fermionic elds also has a non-zero
witten index, because an unpaired ramond eld r(z) is explicitly given by the spin
eld (z) of majorana fermion (z) with conformal dimension  = 1/16, i.e. by
the magnetization operator of the ising model.

1,3

the above observations become important in the understanding the o-critical
dynamics relative to the deformation of the action of the superconformal minimal
models smm by means of the relevant supersymmetric neveu-schwartz operator
n (m)
in fact, as shown in [24], the massless renormalization group ow
1,3 (z, ).
generated by such an operator preserves the witten index. therefore the long
distance behaviour of the deformed smm minimal model  controlled by the action
am + r d2z d2 n (m)
(for a positive value of the coupling constant , with the
usual conformal normalization of the supereld)  is ruled by the xed point of
the minimal model smm2. therefore this action describes the rg ow smm 
smm2, with a corresponding jump in steps of two of the central charge1, i.e.
c = c(m)  c(m  2). therefore, a cascade of massless ows which start from
c = 3/2 and progress by all n (m)
1,3 deformations of smm met along the way must
necessarily pass through the model with c = 1 in the second to last step rather than
the lowest model2 with c = 7/10. this is indeed the scenario which is described by
a specic analytical continuation of the coupling constant of the super-sinh-gordon
model, the so-called roaming models.

let us now discuss the deformation of the c = 3/2 superconformal theory which
leads to the sshg model. at the conformal point, the explicit realization of the
component of the super stress-energy tensor are given by

t (z) =  1
g(z) = iz ,

2(cid:2)(z)2  (cid:3) ;

(7)

and they satisfy the conservation laws zt (z) = zg(z) = 0. once this supercon-
formal model is deformed according to the lagrangian (3), the new conservation
laws are given by zt (z, z) = z(z, z); zg(z, z) = z(z, z), where

(z, z) =

(z, z) =

m2
22 sinh2  + im cosh  ,
m


 sinh  .

(8)

1this is in contrast of what happens in the ordinary conformal minimal models, where the deformation
3 induces a massless ow between two next neighborod

of the conformal action by means of the operator 1
minimal models.

,

2as well known, the lowest model with c = 7/10 corresponds to the class of universality of the

tricritical ising model.

3

for the anti-analytic part of the super stress-energy tensor we have z t (z, z) =
z(z, z); zg(z, z) = z(z, z), where (z, z) is as before and the other elds are
given by

g(z, z) = iz ;
(z, z) =

 sinh  .

m


(9)

the operators (z, z), (z, z) and (z, z) belong to the trace of the supersymmetric
stress-energy tensor and they are related each other by

(z, z) = {(z, z),q} , z(z, z) = [(z, z),q] ;
(z, z) = {(z, z),q} , z(z, z) = [(z, z),q] ,

where the charges of supersymmetry are expressed by

(10)

(11)

q =r g(z, z)dz + (z, z)dz ;
q =r g(z, z)dz + (z, z)dz .

in addition to the above conservation laws, the sshg model possesses higher inte-
grals of motion which were explicitly determined in [21]. therefore its scattering
processes are purely elastic and factorizable. and its two-body s-matrix is discussed
in the next section.
the s-matrix of the sshg

the angle  is a positive quantity, related to the coupling constant  of the model

(15)

this equation implies that the sshg is a quantum eld theory invariant under
the strong-weak duality   4
 . it is now interesting to analyse several analytic
continuations of the above s-matrix in the parameter .

under the analytic continuation   , the sshg model goes into the super
sine-gordon model and the s-matrix (12) describes in this case the scattering of the

4

lowest breather states of the latter model. at the particular value  = /3 we can
consistently truncate the theory at the super sine-gordon breather sector only3.
at this value, the pole at  = 2i/3 of the s-matrix can be regarded as due to the
bosonic and fermionic one-particle states | b()i and | f ()i. these particles are
therefore bound states of themselves, in the channels bb  b  bb, f f  b  f f ,
for the bosonic particle b, and in the channels bf  f  f b, f b  f  bf , for the
fermionic particle f . there is of course a price to pay for this truncation: this means
that the residues of the s-matrix at these poles will be purely imaginary. such a
model therefore would be the supersymmetric analogous of the yang-lee model for
the ordinary sine-gordon model [20]. it was considered originally by schoutens [18]
and it has been identied with the o-critical supersymmetric deformation of the
non-unitary superconformal minimal model with central charge c = 21/4.
another analytic continuation of the s-matrix gives rise to the socalled roaming
models. notice, in fact, that the s matrix (12) of the sshg model has zeros in the
physical strip located at 1 = i and 2 = i(1  ). by varying the coupling
constant , they move along the imaginary axis and they nally meet at the point
i/2, at the self-dual value of the coupling constant 2 = 4. if we further increase
the value of the coupling constant, they simply swap positions. but there is a more
interesting possibility: as rst proposed by al. zamolodchikov for the analogous
case of the ordinary sinh-gordon model [25], once the two zeros meet at i, they
can enter the physical strip by taking complex values of the coupling constant. in
this way, the location of the two zeros are given by  = 1
2  i0. from the analytic
s-matrix theory, the existence of complex zeros in the physical strip implies the
presence of resonances in the system. by analysing the nite-size behaviour of
the theory by means of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz [26], the interesting
result is that the net eect of these resonances consists in an innite cascade of
massless renormalization group ows generated by the neveu-schwartz elds n m
and passing through all minimal superconformal model smm with non-zero witten
index. as previously discussed, the ending point of this innite-nested rg ow
should describe the n1,3 deformation of the superconformal model sm4. is this
really the case? by taking the limit   i into the s-matrix (12), it is easy to
see that it reduces the s-matrix of the sine-gordon model at  = 2. since this
s-matrix describes a massive deformation of the c = 1 model, in order to conrm
the above roaming trajectory scenario the only thing that remains to check is the
comparison of the anomalous dimension of deforming eld.
in the sine-gordon
model at  = 2, the anomalous dimension of the deforming eld is  = 2/3, which
is indeed the conformal dimension of the top component of the supereld n1,3 in
the model sm4.
form factors of the trace operators of the sshg model
for integrable quantum eld theories, the knowledge of the s-matrix is very
often the starting point for a complete solution of quantum eld dynamics in terms
of an explicit construction of the correlation functions of all elds of the theory.
this result can be obtained by computing rst the matrix elements of the operators
on the asymptotic states (the so-called form factors) [1, 2] and then inserting them

1,3

3the general class of these models is obtained by taking  = /(2n + 1), n = 1, 2, . . . and they
correspond to the supersymmetric deformation of the non-unitary minimal superconformal models with
central charge c = 3n (4n + 3)/(2n + 2).

into the the spectral representation of the correlators. for instance, in the case of
the two-point correlation function of a generic operator o(z, z) we have
da2 (a2) k0(azz) ,

g(z, z) = h0 | o(z, z)o(0, 0) | 0i =z 

(16)

where k0(x) is the usual bessel function. the spectral density (a2) is given in this

(17)

the form-factor approach has proved to be extremely successful for theories with
scalar s-matrix, leading to an explicit solution of models of statistical mechanics
interest such as the ising model [1, 6, 12], the yang-lee model [13] or quantum
eld theories dened by a lagrangian, like the sinh-gordon model [7, 9]. on the
contrary, for theories with a non-scalar s-matrix the functional equations satised
by the form factors are generally quite dicult to tackle and a part from the sine-
gordon model or theories which can be brought back to it [1, 2, 4], there is presently
no mathematical technique available for solving them in their full generality. also in
this case, however, the situation is not as impractible as it might seem at rst sight.
the reason consists in the fast convergent behaviour of the spectral representation
series which approximates the correlation functions with a high level of accuracy
even if truncated at the rst available matrix elements [1117].
in the light of
this fact, we will compute the lowest matrix elements of two of the most important
operators of the theory, namely the trace operators (z, z), (z, z) and (z, z) of the
supersymmetric stress-energy tensor of the sshg model. for the operator (0, 0),
they are given by4

f 
bb () = h0 | (0, 0) | b(1)b(2)i ;
f 
f f () = h0 | (0) | f (1)f (2)i ,

whereas for the operators (0, 0) we have instead

f 
bf (1, 2) = h0 | (0, 0) | b(1)f (2)i ;
f 
f b(1, 2) = h0 | (0, 0) | f (1)b(2)i ,

(18)

(19)

(with an analogous result for the lowest form factors of the operator (0, 0)). since
the operators ,  and  are related each other by supersymmetry, as consequence
of eqs. (10) we have

(20)

f 

f 

bb () =  (cid:16)e1/2 f 
f f () =  (cid:16)e2/2 f

4they depend on the dierence of rapidities  = 1  2 since (0, 0) is a scalar operator.

it is therefore sucient to compute the two-particle form factors of the operator
(z, z) for determining those of (z, z) and (z, z). let us discuss the functional
equations satised by f 
f f (). the rst set of equations (called the uni-
tarity equations) rules the monodromy properties of the matrix elements as dictated
by the s-matrix amplitudes

for the other amplitudes. the second set of equations (called crossing equations)
express the locality of the operator (z, z)

the way to solve these equations was found in [3] and passes by the denition
of two auxiliary functions h() which are related to the scattering amplitudes

constructing the matrix elements f

behaviour of the correlator and to provide a reasonable estimate of their short

at the origin one would need the knowledge of all higher particle form factors.
c-theorem sum rule

the sshg model can be seen as a massive deformation of the superconformal
model with the central charge c = 3
2 . while this xed point rules the ultraviolet
properties of the model, its large distance behaviour is controlled by a purely massive
theory with c = 0. the variation of the central charge in this rg ow is dictated
by the c-theorem of zamolodchikov [28], which can be formulated in terms of a
sum rule [29]

analogous expression is obtained by a fermionic version of the ctheorem [3]. the
numerical data relative to the above integral for dierent values of the coupling
constant  is reported in the above table. they are remarkably close to the theo-
retical value c = 3
2 , even for the largest possible value of the coupling constant,
which is the self-dual point  = 4. in addition to this satisfactory check, a more
interesting result is obtained by analysing the application of the c-theorem sum rule
to models which are obtained as analytic continuation of the sshg.

percent of the exact value c = 1 relative to this case.
in the analytic continuation   , the s-matrix develops a pole in the phys-
ical strip located at  = 2i. for this model, the operator (z, z) has also a one-

the estimate of the central charge of the model further improves, c = 5.2482(4),

the form factors above determined for the trace operator (x) can be used
also in this case to estimate its two-point correlation function. the graph of this
function is shown in figure 2: note that this function diverges at the origin, in
agreement with the positive conformal dimension  = 1/4 of this operator, but it
presents a nonmonotonous behaviour for the alternating sign of its spectral series.
