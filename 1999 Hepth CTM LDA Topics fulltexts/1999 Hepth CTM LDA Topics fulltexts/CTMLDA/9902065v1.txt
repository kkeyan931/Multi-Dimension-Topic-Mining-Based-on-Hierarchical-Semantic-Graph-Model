abstract

we study some dynamical properties of a dirac eld in 2+1 dimen-
sions with spacetime dependent domain wall defects. we show that
the callan and harvey mechanism applies even to the case of defects
of arbitrary shape, and in a general state of motion. the resulting
chiral zero modes are localized on the worldsheet of the defect, an
embedded curved two dimensional manifold. the dynamics of these
zero modes is governed by the corresponding induced metric and spin
connection. using known results about determinants and anomalies
for fermions on surfaces embedded in higher dimensional spacetimes,
we show that the chiral anomaly for this two dimensional theory is
responsible for the generation of a current along the defect. we derive
the general expression for such a current in terms of the geometry of
the defect, and show that it may be interpreted as due to an inertial
electric eld, which can be expressed entirely in terms of the spacetime
curvature of the defects. we discuss the application of this framework
to fermionic systems with defects in condensed matter.

the behavior of fermions in the background of defects is a problem of
general interest in many areas of physics ranging from the behavior of tex-
tures in superuid phases of he3 [1] to cosmic strings [2]. the prototype of
these problems is the callan-harvey eect [3] in which a fermi eld (whose
physical meaning depends on the specic problem) in an odd-dimensional
spacetime couples to the defect through a mass term which takes a positive
value on half of the space and a negative value on the other half. under these
circumstances, the matter (fermi) eld has a bound state (a zero mode) at
the defect which is capable of carrying currents. thus, the presence of the
defect leads to an anomaly in the gauge current in the bulk which is exactly
compensated by an equal and opposite anomaly at the defect. a similar
phenomenon is also found at the edge of a droplet of a (non-relativistic) two-
dimensional electron gas in a magnetic eld in the regime of the fractional
and integer quantum hall eects, where the anomaly in the bulk hall current
is cancelled by the gauge anomaly of the chiral edge states[4, 5].

while in most problems static defects are sucient to describe the physics,
in many others (particularly in condensed matter) it is of current interest to
understand the possible eects due to the dynamics of the defects. in partic-
ular, it is interesting to investigate the interaction of the fermion zero modes
with the uctuating geometry induced by the dynamics of the defect.

in this letter we shall generalize the results of [6], which dealt with a dirac
eld in 2 + 1 dimensions having space dependent domain wall like defects in
their mass, to the case of an arbitrary, space and time dependent defect.
we shall show that the analog of the callan and harvey mechanism [3],
namely, the existence of a chiral zero mode, still holds, with the zero mode
now localized on the defect worldsheet. an important dierence is that now,
even in the absence of any external gauge eld, there is an induced fermionic
current on the defect, caused by the gravitational chiral anomaly for the
fermions localized on the defect. this current can be thought of as due to
the existence of an eective or inertial electric eld, dened in terms of
the geometry of the defect (the term inertial comes from the fact that it
vanishes when the defect is not accelerated).

the action for a dirac fermion in three euclidean dimensions, described
by the cartesian coordinates x0, x1, x2 (x0 denoting the euclidean time), in
the presence of a space-time dependent mass m(x), is given by

s = z d3x (x) [d + m(x)] (x)

(1)

2

where d =  + iea. we have included a gauge eld for the sake of
generality, although it shall be taken to be zero in most of this work. the
euclidean dirac matrices  are chosen according to

0 = 3 1 = 1 2 = 2 ,

(2)

where  denote the usual pauli matrices. we adopt the convention of using
letters from the rst part of the greek alphabet to denote tensor components
with respect to cartesian coordinates. moreover, as the three-dimensional
space-time is assumed to be at, these indices will be raised and lowered by
using the identity tensor  = . letters from the end of the greek alpha-
bet shall instead be reserved for tensor components in general coordinates.
rather than considering arbitrary congurations for the mass, we shall
concentrate on those having a spacetime dependent step-like defect. this
kind of conguration is conveniently parametrized as

m(x) =  sign[(x)]

(3)

where (x) = (x) is a scalar eld changing sign along a surface which, by
denition, is the worldsheet of the defect.  is a constant with the dimensions
of a mass, characterizing (half of) the height of the defect. since the defect is
completely determined by the behaviour of  in an innitesimal neighborhood
of that surface, we are entitled to extend its denition in the most convenient
way, to cover all the spacetime.

here we will consider the simple case of defects dened by scalar elds
(x) with the property that  are solutions of laplaces equation, and hence
the surfaces of constant  split 2 + 1-dimensional spacetime in two. in other
terms,  denes a foliation of spacetime, namely, if the three-dimensional
spacetime considered is a manifold m (typically, m = 3), then the follow-
ing relations hold:

m = [c {x : (x) = c}
{x : (x) = c}\{x : (x) = c} =  ,c 6= c   .

(4)

these condition are of course not sucient to uniquely determine the function
. we shall see below that some other constraints, compatible with (4), arise
naturally when seeking for the simplest analytical description of the geometry
of the system. we rst need to write the three-dimensional action in general
coordinates x

(5)

s = z d3x g

1

2  [d + m()] 

3

where

 =

x
x

  {, } = 2 g

with g denoting the metric in the new coordinates, namely

g = 

x
x

x
x

.

(6)

(7)

we now impose some requirements on the (choice of) coordinates x, in
order to have a simple description of the zero mode, and to disentangle (as
far as possible) its dynamics from the one of the bulk degrees of freedom.
these come from the fermionic modes dened in the region where the mass
has a nite value. we dene one of the new coordinates as . this choice
singles out a surface for each value of , the defect corresponding to  = 0.
the other two coordinates dene constant  surfaces in parametric form.
they are then orthogonal to , what implies the general expression for the
length element:

ds2 = h2

(, )d2 + gab(, )dadb

(8)
where 0 = x0, and 1 = x1. we introduced the special notation a, a =
0, 1 for two of the coordinates, since they shall parametrize the constant-
surfaces, and will be the proper coordinates on a curved two dimensional
spacetime when studying the chiral zero mode dynamics. namely, the defect
will be expressed in parametric form as

x  = x (0, 1) ,  = 0, 1, 2.

(9)

it is always possible, by a redenition of , to have h = 1. in fact, this
amounts to redening  in such a way that it still denes a foliation, and
moreover, if one moves an amount d in the normal direction to a surface of
constant  the length of such displacement is just d. we assume in what
follows that such a choice of  has been made. then

where

ds2 = d2 + gab(, )dadb

gab =

x
a

x
b

.

(10)

(11)

in these coordinates, the dirac matrices: a =
the algebraic relations

a
x

,  =


x

 satisfy

{a, b} = 2 gab , {, a} = 0 , ()2 = 1 .

(12)

4

we note that the two matrices a play the role of dirac matrices for the two
dimensional manifold  = constant, while  plays the role of a (chirality)
5 matrix, and we shall adopt the notation 5  . indeed, the latter is the
projection of the dirac matrices in three dimensions along the direction of
the unit normal vector to each surface,

5(, ) = n(, )

where

2 (, )0x (, ) 1x (, )
with  the euclidean levi-civita symbol, and g = det(gab).

n(, ) = g 1

we now write the action (5) as

s = z d2d g

1

2 (, )d (, )

(13)

(14)

(15)

in terms of the operator d = d + m() which in our coordinates reads
(16)

d = 5d + m() + ada .

assuming now a = 0, aa = aa() (or a conguration connected to this one
by a gauge transformation), we see that:

d = [ + m()+ 6 d]pl + [ + m()+ 6 d]pr ,

where we introduced the projectors

pl =

1 + 5

2

, pr =

1  5

2

.

(17)

(18)

and 6 d the two dimensional euclidean dirac operator corresponding to the
two coordinates a, namely
(19)

6 d = aa .

1

we note that, even with this special choice of coordinates, both the func-
2 and the operator 6 d will, in general, depend on the coordinate .
tion g
however, we shall assume that both, the curvature radius of the defect in
the spatial plane, and the characteristic length of the uctuations in its shape,
are much larger than its localization length in the spatial plane. therefore
we may regard 6 d and g
2 as -independent. this is obvious for the modes
that are concentrated near to the defect but it is, indeed, also true for the

1

5

case of non-localized modes, since they are sensitive only to the module of
the mass, which is assumed to be constant outside the defect.

we can now borrow, with slight modications, the results from [6] to
rewrite the action (15) in terms of an innite number of two-dimensional
actions, one of which shall describe the zero mode. to that end we introduce
a and a, operators acting on functions of  only,

so that

a =  + m() , a =  + m() ,

d = (a+ 6 d)pl + (a+ 6 d)pr

(20)

(21)

we can extract the dependence on  from the elds, by expanding them
in the modes of the hermitian operator built in terms of d and its adjoint
(d itself is not hermitian)

h = dd = (h 6 d2)pl + (h 6 d2)pr ,

(22)

with h = aa and h = aa. the expansions of the fermionic elds will read

(, ) = xn hn()(n)
(, ) = xn h (n)
l ()

l () + n()(n)

n() + (n)

r () 

r ()i
n()i

(23)

where the subscripts l, r denote eigenvectors of pl and pr, respectively.
the eigenfunctions n and n satisfy

hn() = 2

nn() , h n() = 2

n

n()

hn|mi = n,m , h n| mi = n,m .

(24)
the operators h and h are positive (the n are assumed to be real and
we x their sign, by convention, to be positive) and have the same spectrum,
with the only exception of the zero mode n = 0, since, for any n with
n 6= 0, there also exists one eigenvector of h with identical eigenvalue

hn() = 2

nn()  h [
is introduced to normalize the eigenvectors of h. (of

we see that there is a zero mode for the operator a, whose explicit ex-

pression is

where  satises

l (x) = er 
(0)

d m ( )()

adapl() = 0 ,

(26)

(27)

namely, it is a chiral zero mode.

let us now discuss the contribution of this mode to the eective action.
the chiral zero mode, being a massless excitation, will dominate the eective
low-energy dynamics, and it will be the only mode contributing to the current
induced on the defect due to the uctuations in its shape.

inserting the expansion (23) into the action (15), and keeping only the
term corresponding to the zero mode (26), we see that the resulting action
is the one for a chiral fermion on a two dimensional curved euclidean mani-
fold (the worldsheet of the defect), which, when put in the symmetric form,
becomes

s0 =

1

2 z d2 g

1

2 [ () apl a()  a () apl ()] .

(28)

we have assumed that the  dependent localization factor is normalized to
one 1 and we have dropped the dependence on the gauge eld.

following reference [7], we rewrite this action as

where

s0 = z d2 g

2 gad(gdb,c + gdc,b  gbc,d) is the metric connection, in particular

1all the objects are of course evaluated at  = 0.

r = 2g1 r0101

(32)

where r0101 is the (only) independent component of the riemmann tensor.
this can be written in terms of the induced metric and its derivatives as
follows

r0101 =

(2g01,01  g11,00  g00,11)
gab [(2g0b,0  g00,b)(2g1a,1  g11,a)

 (g0b,1 + g1b,0  g01,b)(g1a,0 + g0a,1  g01,a)] .

(33)

it is also convenient to have an expression for the curvature in terms of
derivatives of the parametric equations which dene the defect space-time
surface:

r = 2g2 


~x01  ~x01

~x0  ~x01
~x1  ~x01

for the case of dirac fermions on a at 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime cou-
pled to an abelian gauge eld, the knowledge of the chiral anomaly together
with the conservation equation for the current, enables one to determine
the relation between the fermionic current and the external eld. we show
here that in the case we are dealing with, the gravitational chiral anomaly
and the conservation equation for the current also determine the form of the
fermionic current, but now as a function only of the curvature of the defect.
we rst note that equation (31), together with the fact that the vector

current j a() is non-anomalous, implies the two relations:

1

aj a() = g 1
abajb = 0j1()  1j0() = 

2 j a) = 0

2 a(g

g r .

i

24

(35)

in two dimensions, the current can be written as the gradient of a scalar

eld  plus the curl of a pseudoscalar eld ,

jb() = b + ig

1

2 bcc

(36)

1

where the factor g
2 has been introduced in order to compensate for the
jacobian factor due to the levi-civita symbol. imposing conditions (35) to
the current expressed in terms of the scalar elds (36), we deduce that the
functions  and  must satisfy

g 1

2 a) =  = 0
2 a) =  =

(37)

where  denotes the laplacian acting on scalar elds. therefore, by solving
(37) for  and  and substituting it into (8) one can nd the fermionic current
in terms of the curvature of the defect. of course, the rst equation implies
that the eld  vanishes, thus we arrive to the general expression

ja() = 

i

g

(38)

for the case of a defect whose conguration is close to a static rectilinear
wall, we shall obtain an approximate expression for (38). we assume the
conguration has the form

x (a) = x (a) + y (a)

(39)

where x (a) denotes the static rectilinear defect which is localized on, say,
the x 2 = 0 plane

x a(a) = a (a = 0, 1)

,

x 2(a) = 0 ,

and y (a) is the uctuating part

y (a) = 

2 (a)

(40)

(41)

with  a small but otherwise arbitrary function.

we then expand (38) in powers of , which keeping only the leading

(quadratic) term yields, after some algebra

ja() =

i

12

abb1

0 det(

2
cd

) ,

(42)

where 0 = aa is the free laplacian. it is interesting to notice the striking
similarity between (42) and the corresponding formula yielding the electric

9

current j el for a fermion on a at two dimensional spacetime, but in the
presence of an external electric eld e

which allows we to dene an eective geometric electric eld eef f

eef f =

det(

(43)

(44)

in particular, for all the congurations such that  is a quadratic form in the
coordinates, det(  2
) becomes a constant. that constant will be non-zero
cd
whenever the quadratic form is non-degenerated, namely, when the surface
does indeed have a non-zero curvature. in this case the induced current is
the analogous of the one obtained by applying a uniform electric eld to a
one dimensional system of massless dirac fermions.

our result has, as we stated above, a simple and intuitive explanation: as
the defect moves, relative to the frame of the stationary defect, the fermions
feel an inertial electric eld which expresses the fact that the fermions are
being left behind by the moving defect. on the other hand the current
induced by the motion of the defect, being anomalous, has the interpretation
of a local change of the zero of the energy of the dirac sea (i. e. the chemical
potential).

it is worth to note that eects of this type are not a peculiarity of dirac
fermions, and that they also appear for non-relativistic particles on a moving
defect. in fact, an analog of this problem has been considered recently in
the context of formation of stripes in high-temperature superconductors
and eects of this type were found to play a signicant role[8]. finally, given
that the mass term in a dirac eld in 2 + 1 dimensions breaks time reversal
invariance, it is natural to expect, not only that similar eects should be
present in anisotropic states of the two-dimensional electron gas in magnetic
elds[9], but that a description involving a dirac eld with defects should
play an important role in their theoretical description.
