abstract

we present new anti-de sitter black hole solutions of gauged n = 8, so(8) supergravity,
which is the massless sector of the ads4 s7 vacuum of m-theory. by focusing on the u(1)4
cartan subgroup, we nd non-extremal 1, 2, 3 and 4 charge solutions. in the extremal limit,
they may preserve up to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and 1/8 of the supersymmetry, respectively. in the
limit of vanishing so(8) coupling constant, the solutions reduce to the familiar black holes of
the m4  t 7 vacuum, but have very dierent interpretation since there are no winding states
on s7 and no u-duality. in contrast to the t 7 compactication, moreover, we nd no static
multi-center solutions. also in contrast, the s7 elds appear already dualized so that the 4
charges may be all electric or all magnetic rather than 2 electric and 2 magnetic. curiously,
however, the magnetic solutions preserve no supersymmetries. we conjecture that a subset
of the extreme electric black holes preserving 1/2 the supersymmetry may be identied with
the s7 kaluza-klein spectrum, with the non-abelian so(8) quantum numbers provided by
the fermionic zero modes.

1 introduction

the correspondence between anti-de sitter space and conformal eld theories on its boundary
[1, 2, 3, 4] has revived an interest in gauged extended supergravities which arise as the
massless sector of the kaluza-klein compactications of d = 11 supergravity, such as ads4
s7 and ads7  s4 or type iib supergravity, such as ads5  s5 [5]. gauged n = 8
d = 4 supergravity [6, 7], which is the massless sector of the s7 compactication, has also
featured in a recent cosmological context with attempts to reconcile an open universe with
ination [8, 9, 10, 11]. although this kaluza-klein compactication was the subject of much
investigation in the past [12], relatively little eort has been devoted to the issue of black
hole solutions of the gauged n = 8 theory3. this is the subject of the present paper.

although both are maximally symmetric, the s7 compactication diers from the t 7 in
several important respects. first of all, the global so(8) is promoted to a gauge symmetry.
secondly, the underlying supersymmetry algebra is no longer poincare but rather ads4 and
the lagrangian has a non-vanishing cosmological constant  proportional to the square of
the gauge coupling constant g:

g  g2,

(1.1)

where g is newtons constant. consequently, we shall be seeking black hole solutions that
are asymptotically ads rather than minkowski. we also face the dierence that the gauge
group is non-abelian. by focusing on the u(1)4 cartan subgroup, we nd non-extremal 1, 2,
3 and 4 charge solutions. in the extremal limit they may preserve up to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and 1/8
of the supersymmetry, respectively. in the limit of vanishing so(8) coupling constant, the
solutions reduce to the familiar black holes of the m4  t 7 vacuum, but have very dierent
interpretation since there are no winding states on s7 and no u-duality. in contrast to the
t 7 compactication, moreover, we nd no static multi-center solutions. also in contrast, the
s7 elds appear already dualized so that the 4 charges may be all electric or all magnetic
rather than 2 electric and 2 magnetic. curiously, however, the magnetic solutions preserve
no supersymmetries.

previous papers [16, 17, 18] have explored the possibility that the bps spectrum of
toroidally compactied string and m theory, and in particular the kaluza-klein modes, could
be identied with extreme black hole solutions of the low-energy supergravity theory. it was
found that this identication was consistent not only with the mass and charge spectrum [16]
but also with the spins and supermultiplet structure [19, 20, 21] and with the dipole moments
and gyromagnetic ratios [22]. in a similar spirit, we here conjecture that a subset of the ads
electric black hole solutions preserving half the supersymmetry may be identied with the s7
kaluza-klein spectrum [23, 24, 12] with the non-abelian so(8) quantum numbers provided
by the fermionic zero modes.

3bps black holes arising in the su (2)su (2) version of gauged (n = 4, d = 4) supergravity, which is the
massless sector of the s3s3 compactication of (n = 1, d = 10) supergravity, have recently been discussed
in [13]. our solutions will be signicantly dierent from these. in particular ours are asymptotically ads
while those of [13] are asymptotically neither ads nor minkowski. additionally, both bps and non-bps
black hole solutions in gauged (n = 2, d = 5) supergravity were examined in [14] and [15] respectively.

multiplet by (e

in the case of ungauged n = 8 supergravity, black holes are completely characterized
by 28 electric and 28 magnetic charges under the u(1) gauge elds. in the present case,
however, the gauge group is non-abelian, and hence the situation is less clear. in order to

proceed, we work in an abelian truncation of the gauged n = 8 theory by focusing only
on the u(1)4 cartan subgroup of so(8). in particular, we choose the cartan generators to
correspond to adjacent index pairs:

{a12

 , a34

 , a56

 , a78
 },

(2.7)

and set the remaining gauge elds to zero. note that while in principle it is important to
check that this provides a consistent truncation, in practice as long as the supersymmetry
variations (at least partially) vanish the state is essentially ensured to be bps.

for the scalars, we work in symmetric gauge [25, 26] where the 56-bein may be written

as

v = exp(

0 (cid:19)) ,

(2.8)

with ijkl self-dual. let us denote so(8) index pairs {12, 34, 56, 78} by () where  =
1, . . . , 4. specializing to real scalars, we are lead to the following ansatz:

ijkl = ijkl = 2[(12)((12) + (34)) + (13)((13) + (24)) + (14)((14) + (23))]ijkl,

(2.9)

where numbers in parentheses correspond to appropriate index pairs so that e.g. (13)
ijkl = 1
whenever {i, j, k, l} corresponds to a permutation of {1, 2, 5, 6}. this ansatz is of course self-
dual by construction. thus we have reduced the original 70 (real) scalar degrees of freedom
to just three in this specialization. for this case, using the denition (2.2), we nd that the
su(8) connection and scalar kinetic terms become4

where the scalar combinations {} are given by

v = 4g2(cid:16)cosh (12) + cosh (13) + cosh (14)(cid:17) .

4note that su (8) and so(8) indices are indistinguishable here. this is a consequence of specializing to

a particular gauge choice for the scalars.

note that the {} are not all independent as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 0. the u(1) gauge elds
in (2.11) are essentially the so(8) triality rotated combinations

(2.14)

for later convenience we have dened the matrix , which satises  = t and 2 = i.

several comments are in order here. the rst is that, save for the potential, (2.13),
and numerical factors in the denition of the scalars, the truncated bosonic action (2.11)
is identical to that of a closed string compactied on t 2 with diagonal scalars5. while
on the one hand this may not be too surprising, since supersymmetry must necessarily
constrain the couplings between the scalars and vectors, on the other hand it is somewhat
remarkable since the four u(1) elds have rather dierent interpretations in the two cases:
as the cartan generators of so(8) for the gauged supergravity, and as two kaluza-klein and
two winding gauge elds for the t 2 compactication. following up on this correspondence,
the second point is that we have a priori constrained the three scalars (12), (13) and (14)
to be real. we believe that allowing the scalars to be complex in (2.9) would in fact lead to a
complete correspondence between (2.11) and the general t 2 compactied eective lagrangian
with three complex scalars. nevertheless, this brings up the issue that the additional scalar
degrees of freedom do play a role in terms of giving rise to additional conditions on the
bosonic solutions in order to maintain a consistent truncation. finally, it is important to
realize that when g 6= 0 the potential (2.13) may not be ignored, and xes the asymptotic
scalar values to vanish, (12)
= 0, with corresponding negative energy density

v

= 12g2.
a slight notational complication arises in expressing the supersymmetry variations (2.6)
in terms of explicit eld components (as opposed to fully so(8) invariant quantities). as
above, we denote so(8) index pairs {12, 34, 56, 78} by () where  = 1, . . . , 4, in which case
the single so(8) index i = 1, . . . , 8 may be replaced by the combination i() with the latter
i taking on either 1 or 2 corresponding to the rst or the second of the pair (). in this case
the gravitino variation may be written as

where the sum over  is implied. for the spin-1/2 fermions and the cartan ansatz, we

5note that to make the actual correspondence, two of the gauge elds (say f (2) and f (4)) need to be
dualized to provide a consistent identication with the string dilaton (in this case (13)). of course the
choice of elds to dualize is only determined up to string-string-string triality [19].

3 the a = 3 black hole in gauged supergravity

in the previous section we have described a truncation of gauged n = 8 supergravity to its
abelian u(1)4 sector. the resulting lagrangian and corresponding fermion supersymmetry
may be further simplied by focusing on single-charge black hole solutions. in particular, we
take (12) = (13) = (14)   with corresponding f (1)
  f non-vanishing. the resulting
lagrangian then becomes

l =

1
22

g(cid:20)r

2

  2e3ff  + 12g2 cosh (cid:21) + . . . ,

(3.1)

where the dots refer to elds that will be set equal to zero in our solution. note that a
scaling   /3 may be performed to normalize the scalar kinetic term canonically, which
also demonstrates the correspondence to the conventional a = 3 denition, where a is the
scalar-maxwell parameter appearing in eaff .

for the single-charge solution, it is straightforward to see that the supersymmetry trans-
formations, (2.15) and (2.16), essentially take on multiple identical copies, one for each dif-
ferent () value. it is thus sucient to focus on a single supersymmetry parameter, e.g. i(1),
instead of the more general i(). note that this also demonstrates how such a solution can
be interpreted in an n = 2 or n = 4 context. the resulting supersymmetry variations are

(3.2)

where we have dropped unnecessary so(8) index-pair symbols.

using the well known a = 3 black hole solution as a guide, we now consider a spherically
symmetric electric black hole ansatz. before describing the black hole in gauged supergravity,
we rst observe that when g = 0 the above lagrangian (3.1) admits an ordinary a = 3
(electric) black hole solution [16]:

ds2 = h1/2dt2 + h 1/2(dr2 + r2d2),

(3.3)

where h = 1 + q/r, and with the scalar and gauge eld given (in the above normalization)
by

e2(



) = h,

a0 =

e3



/2h1

(3.4)


22

( = 1 sets the actual sign of the charge). furthermore, we recall that it was demonstrated
in [27, 14, 15] that extreme black hole solutions generally have simple extensions to the case

6

of non-zero gauging, and in fact generally retain their supersymmetry properties. following
[14, 15], we thus take the metric ansatz

ds2 = e2af dt2 + e2a(

dr2
f

+ r2d2),

(3.5)

corresponding to an ads generalization of (3.3). note in particular that the vacuum ads
solution is given by the choice f = 1 + 2g2r2 with a = 0.

with the metric (3.5) the gauge equation of motion becomes r(e2a+3r2ra0) = 0 and
is unaected by both g and the function f . this suggests that the harmonic function ansatz,
= 0.
(3.4), simply carries over to the g 6= 0 case, with the only additional constraint that 
turning to the supersymmetry variation, i, we nd, using (3.4), that



i =

so that the natural half-supersymmetry projection is given by

(3.6)

(3.7)

(acting on real spinors i = i) provided f = 1 + 2g2r2h. using this expression for f , it
is now straightforward to check that all bosonic equations of motion arising from (3.1) are
satised. to summarize, the single-charge black hole solution in gauged supergravity is given
by

ds2 = h1/2f dt2 + h 1/2(

so that this solution in fact preserves exactly half of the supersymmetries. note that substi-

(3.13)
which is the form that appears in [27]. although we have focused on n = 8 in the present
case, this killing spinor construction is general, and also applies in the n = 2 and n = 4
truncations of the full n = 8 theory.

when written in the form (3.12), the above killing spinors resemble a supersymmetry

(3.15)

 (g = 0)  1

which satises the well known killing spinor condition p 0
2 (1 + 0ij)(g = 0) =
0. an added consequence of this simple structure in the g  0 case is that the fermion
zero modes are easily constructed solely by changing the sign of the projection in (3.15).
such zero modes are immediately orthogonal to the killing spinors and furthermore satisfy
the supergauge condition i
 = 0 [28, 29]. unfortunately this situation is not as clear
when g 6= 0; this is mainly due to complications arising from the nature of the projection
(3.7) in the gauged supergravity. for this reason, although it is manifest that this black
hole preserves exactly half of the supersymmetries, its supermultiplet structure arising from
the fermion zero mode construction [29, 22] is less well understood. on the other hand, the
fact that it preserves half the supersymmetry presumably means that it belongs to the short
maximum spin 2 supermultiplet.

4 multiple charge black holes

returning to the complete simplied n = 8 lagrangian (2.11) we note that, in the absence of
the scalar potential, this admits well known supersymmetric black hole solutions with up to
four charges. since the single charge solution has a straightforward generalization for g 6= 0,
as shown above, one may wonder whether this is also true for the four charge solution. a

6some of the dierence in the t-dependent terms may be eliminated by a suitable gauge transformation.

this issue also arises in the next section when considering the multiple charge black hole.

8

careful examination of the equations of motion arising from (2.11) shows that this is in fact
the case. in contrast to the usual form of the action arising from t 2 compactication of the
closed string (which may be written in either s, t or u form [19]), in which a dilaton scalar is
singled out, the lagrangian (2.11) treats all three scalars and four gauge elds symmetrically.
in practice, this indicates that we are interested in a four electric charge black hole solution.
we nd

from the decomposition of the n = 8 spinor parameter i into the four i() where

into four sets, involving separate  signs in the combination of the eld strengths. focusing

we see that the killing spinor equations, 1

identical with those that arise from the single charge case, (3.11). thus the killing spinors

until now we have only considered the rst out of four sets of n = 8 supersymmetries,
namely those parametrized by i(1). naturally the form of the other three sets of variations
are constrained by n = 8 supersymmetry, and dier only by the relative choices of signs
between the four cartan gauge elds. preservation of (half) supersymmetry in each of the
four sectors demands the following sign choices:

1 :
2 :
3 :
4 :

1 = 2 = 3 = 4
1 = 2 = 3 = 4
1 = 2 = 3 = 4
1 = 2 = 3 = 4.

(4.9)

it is not coincidental that these signs match those of  dened in (2.14). because of the
necessary dierence in signs above, this indicates that in general, when all four charges

10

are active, supersymmetry cannot be partially preserved in all sectors simultaneously. for
one through four active charges, we nd overall that 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and 1/8 of the n = 8
supersymmetry can be preserved, in complete agreement with standard results [30, 31].
when all charges are equal, the solution may be obtained from a single scalar, single maxwell
eld truncation with scalar-maxwell parameter a = 3, 1, 1/3, 0 just as in the case of non-
gauged supergravity [16, 20, 21, 19]. of course, one can also choose the charges so that fewer
or even no supersymmetries are preserved, even though the black holes are still extremal
[16].

in the case of ungauged supergravity, on the basis of these mass and charge assignments,
it was further suggested [16, 20, 21, 19] that we interpret these four values of a as 1-, 2-, 3-
and 4-particle bound states with zero binding energy. for example, the reissner-nordstrom
(a = 0) black hole combines four (a = 3) black holes: an electric kaluza-klein black
hole, a magnetic kaluza-klein black hole, an electric winding black hole and a magnetic
winding black hole. this zero-binding-energy bound-state conjecture can, in fact, be veried
in the classical black hole picture by nding explicit 4-centered black hole solutions which
coincide with the a = 3, 1, 1/3, 0 solutions as we bring 1, 2, 3, 4 centers together and take
the remaining 3, 2, 1, 0 centers out to innity [20]. such a construction is possible because
of the appearance of four independent harmonic functions [32]. moreover, this provides
a novel realization of the no-force condition in that the charge carried by each black hole
corresponds to a dierent u(1). thus the gravitational attraction cannot be cancelled by
an electromagnetic repulsion but rather by a subtle repulsion due to scalar exchange. this
phenomenon was also observed in [33]. in the above, for purposes of illustration, the special
case has been chosen where all non-zero charges are equal to unity but it is easily generalized
to the case of dierent electric charges q1, p2, q3, p4 where the interpretation is that of a
(q1 + p2 + q3 + p4)-particle bound state with zero binding energy [34].

it is tempting to generalize this bound state picture to the black holes of the gauged
supergravity discussed in the present paper. one interesting dierence from the non-gauged
supergravity case, however, is that we nd no static multi-center solutions. while the present
solution is again based on four harmonic functions, (4.2), they are however not strictly
independent as they must all share the same center7. this is to be expected on physical
grounds: the presence of a negative cosmological constant ensures that only single center
solutions will be static.

5 the non-extremal solution

while we are mainly interested in the properties of supersymmetric black holes, we note
that there is a straightforward generalization of the above solutions to the non-extremal
case. in the ungauged case, the extremal solution can be blackened by the incorporation
of a universal function f = 1  k/r modifying the standard p-brane metric of the form [35]

ds2 = e2af dt2 + e2b(

dr2
f

+ r2d2).

(5.1)

7examination of the equations of motion indicates that the obstruction to nding multi-center solutions

arises not from the gauge equation, but rather from the scalar and einstein equations.

11

subsequently, it was shown in [15] that this prescription generalizes in the straightforward
manner to ads black hole solutions as well. in particular, note that the four-charge black
hole metric of (4.1) has the identical form as the non-extremal metric (5.1) and hence appears
compatible with the blackening procedure.

as the manipulations of the equations of motion arising from (2.11) are not particularly
illuminating, we only present the result here. the essential feature of the non-extremal black
hole solution is a merging of the ads function f = 1 + 2g2r2(h1h2h3h4) of (4.2) with the
non-extremal function f = 1  k/r to arrive at

f = 1 

k
r

+ 2g2r2(h1h2h3h4).

(5.2)

in addition, there is a charge rescaling so that the physical electric charges are no longer
related to the mass. introducing  ( = 1, . . . , 4) to parametrize the four charges, we may
write

h = 1 +

note that the extremal limit is approached by letting k  0 and    with q 
k sinh2  xed.
spacetime properties of the above black holes depend on the number of active charges
(n = 0, . . . , 4). for n = 0 the solution reduces to the schwarzschild-anti-de sitter black
hole with a single horizon protecting the singularity at r = 0. on the other hand, the bps
solutions (k = 0) for n = 1, 2, 3 all have singular horizons at r = 0 (with zero area) as
appropriate for extremal black holes. somewhat surprisingly, though, the four-charge bps
black hole has no horizon, and so strictly speaking is a naked singularity8.
in all cases,
the existence of a regular horizon demands k > kmin where kmin is a function of the active
charges. this is in fact similar to the ve dimensional case considered in [14, 15].

6 magnetic black holes

we have seen that the n = 8 gauged supergravity naturally admits a four-electric-charge
black hole solution.
in fact it turns out that this solution is easily generalized to give
magnetically charged black holes; although the full theory involves non-abelian so(8) gauge
elds, the u(1)4 truncation of (2.11) gives rise to bosonic equations of motion that are
symmetric under the electric-magnetic duality

f ()  e  f (),

  .

(6.1)

8for four identical charges, the solution (4.1) reduces to the reissner-nordstrom-anti-de sitter black
hole whose properties were studied in [27]. that einstein-maxwell theory with a cosmological constant is
a consistent truncation of d = 11 supergravity, and hence that d = 11 supergravity has the reissner-
nordstrom-anti-de sitter black hole as a solution, has been known for some time [36, 37].

while the extremal limit is once again reached by taking k  0 and    with
p  k sinh2  xed, the resulting extremal black hole is in fact not supersymmetric when-
ever g 6= 0! in the case of the magnetic reissner-nordstrom black hole, this phenomenon was
previously found in [27]. (note, however, that it is possible to obtain magnetic black holes
that do preserve some supersymmetry if one allows for event horizons with non-spherical
topologies [38]) to see that (6.2) admits no killing spinors, we note that while the scalar
potential (2.13) is symmetric under ()  (), the scalar related terms in the super-
symmetry variations (2.15) and (2.16) are not. in particular, focusing on , we nd for
example

(2(3)i(1)) =

(6.3)

(where   1 = 2 = 3 = 4), indicating explicitly that the g-dependent term on the last
line has a dierent structure than the others. this is in contrast with (4.5) for the electric
solution where all terms combine to give the projection operator (4.6). additionally, note
that the matrices [i05ij] and [rij] now commute, while previously, for the electric black
hole, they had anticommuted in the absence of 5.

for both of the above reasons, we see that whenever g 6= 0 none of the supersymmetry
variations vanish, and hence the magnetic solution is non-bps (regardless of the choice of
signs of the magnetic charges). in the g  0 limit, on the other hand, the last line of (6.3)
drops out, and we are left with

(23i(1)) = 2ijrr log

h1h3
h2h4

pj(1),

(6.4)

 = 1

where p ij
2[iji05ij] is the projection appropriate to a magnetically charged solution.
thus, in the absence of gauging, there is a direct correspondence between the supersymmetry
properties of the electric and the magnetic black holes. however the gauged supergravity
theory (in the abelian truncation) is apparently no longer invariant under electric-magnetic
duality.

7 kaluza-klein states as black holes

for ungauged n = 8 supergravity, the supersymmetry algebra admits 4 central charges
z1, z2, z3, z4. states fall into 5 categories according as they are annihilated by 4  q  0
supersymmetry generators. q also counts the number of zs that obey the bound m = zmax.
non-rotating black holes (in the sense of vanishing bosonic kerr angular momentum l) be-
long to superspin l = 0 supermultiplets [21, 19]. starting with a spin j = 0 member, the
rest of the black hole multiplet may then be lled out using the fermionic zero-modes [29, 22].
the spin will run from j = 0 up to j = (8  q)/2. for gauged supergravity, the algebra is
dierent with no central charges but the same multiplet shortening phenomenon still occurs
[39, 12]. so we can be condent that the above black holes preserving 4, 2, 1, 0 supersymme-
tries will belong to supermultiplets with maximum spins 2, 3, 7/2, 4 9. unfortunately, as far
as we know, the analogue of the m = zmax condition has never been been spelled out in the
literature. it is presumably some relation between the ads quantum numbers (e0, s) and
the so(8) casimirs.

it seems entirely consistent, therefore, to identify a subset of the maximum spin 2 black
hole supermultiplets with the s7 kaluza-klein spectrum, in analogy with the black hole
kaluza-klein correspondence of ungauged supergravity [16, 17]. the subset in question
will correspond to electric black holes whose mass is quantized in units of the inverse s7
radius. however, this raises the puzzle of how the black holes carrying only u(1) charges
can be identied with the kaluza-klein particles carrying non-trivial so(8) representations.
although we have not demonstrated this explicitly, it seems reasonable to suppose that it is
the fermion zero modes that provide the non-trivial so(8) quantum numbers just as they
provide the non-trivial spin. the fact that these nonabelian charges arise from fermionic hair
also nicely circumvents the usual no-hair theorems of classical relativity. in this connection,
it would be interesting to repeat the gyromagnetic ratio calculations of [22] and verify that
the fermionic hair again yields a gyromagnetic ratio equal to 1, as demanded by kaluza-klein
reasoning.

it is furthermore tempting, in analogy with the ungauged case, to identify the 2, 3 and
4 charge solutions as 2, 3 and 4-particle bound states of the singly charged solution [19, 20].
however, although the quantum number assignments are consistent with this, we do not
have multi-center solutions in the ads case. such a bound state interpretation would, of
course, lead to states of arbitrarily high spin.

another dierence between the s7 and the t 7 compactications is that the g  0 limit
of the gauged supergravity does not directly coincide with the massless sector of the t 7
compactication. they dier by various dualizations. thus it was possible, for example, to
nd 4-charge solutions with all charges electric as opposed to the 2-electric and 2-magnetic
charges of the ungauged theory. moreover, whereas 2 charges are kaluza-klein modes and
2 are winding modes in the type iia string theory context, there is no t or u-duality
associated with the s7 compactication.

one might also generalize the purely electric and purely magnetic solutions of this paper
to dyonic black hole solutions of gauged n = 8 supergravity. neither magnetic nor dyonic
black holes have any kaluza-klein interpretation and do not appear in the spectrum of the

9the maximum spin 5/2 solutions are (mysteriously?) absent just as for ungauged supergravity.

14

s7 compactication of d = 11 supergravity.
it would be interesting to provide their m-
theory interpretation and to determine their role in the ads/cft correspondence. might
they be related to a goddard-nuyts-olive [40] non-abelian duality, for example? since,
in the g  0 limit, we recover the black holes which were previously identied with the
t 7 spectrum, moreover, it seems possible that m-theory can interpolate between the two
topologies. perhaps the d = 11 supermembrane, which interpolates between ads7  s7 and
at spacetime [41, 42, 43], plays an important part in this.
