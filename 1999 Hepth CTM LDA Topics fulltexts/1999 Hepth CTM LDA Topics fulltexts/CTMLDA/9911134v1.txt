abstract

the possibility of neutral, brane-like solutions in a higher dimensional setting is dis-
cussed. in particular, we describe a supersymmetric solution in six dimensions which can
be interpreted as a three-brane with a non-compact transverse space of nite volume.
the construction can be generalized to n+4-dimensions and the result is a n+3-brane
compactied on a n 1-dimensional einstein manifold with a non-compact extra dimen-
sion. we nd that there always exists a massless graviton trapped in four-dimensions
while a bulk abelian gauge eld gives rise to a unique four-dimensional massless photon.
moreover, all massless modes are accompanied by massive kk states and we show that it
is possible in such a scenario the masses of the kk states to be at the tev scale without
hierarchically large extra dimensions.

1 introduction

there is a renewal interest in higher-dimensional theories after the realization that string
scale can be lowered even to few tevs [1]. in this case, extra dimensions are expected
to open up at this scale as was originally proposed in [2] motivated by the scale of
supersymmetry breaking. it has also been realized [4], that the size of some dimensions
can even macroscopic as long as the standard model (sm) sector lives solely in four-
dimensions, in a three-brane for example. this proposal oers also a natural explanation
to a long-standing problem in all eorts to extend the sm, namely, the hierarchy problem.
the latter translates into the fact that the ratio mew /mp l of the electroweak scale
mew  103 gev to the planck scale mp l = g1/2
n  1018 gev is unnatural very small.
according to this proposal, the hierarchy is due to the geometry of the higher-dimensional
space-time. in particular, the higher 4 + n dimensional theory with n  2 has a 4 + n
dimensional tev scale planck mass mp l(4+n) while the scale rc of the extra n dimensions
is less than a millimeter. the proposal has been designed in such a way as to generate
the hierarchy mew /mp l.

these ideas have been pushed further by modeling four-dimensional space-time as a
brane embedded in higher dimensions which is reminiscent of some old proposals that
tried to model our world as a domain wall[5]. this is realized in modern terms by the
brane world where our universe is viewed as a three-brane (or p-brane with appropriate
compactied directions, or intersecting branes, etc.). an early example was the horava-
witten picture for the non-perturbative heterotic e8  e8 string [6] and its relevance
for the construction of realistic phenomenological models [7]. a general feature of all
these models is that the gauge sector lives on the brane whereas gravity propagates in
the bulk. although a bulk sm (or partial bulk) has some nice properties like power-law
running couplings [8],[9] and consequently a lower unication scale [9], by trying to put
the gauge sector in the bulk in models with large extra dimensions, for example, one
faces the problem that kaluza-klein (kk) states of the photons should have already
been observed. thus, a bulk sm constraints the size of the extra dimensions to be more
than around 1tev depending on their number [10]. thus, it seems that a bulk gauge
sector is in conict with large extra-dimensions.

here, we will consider classical supergravity solutions which can be interpreted as
domain walls in higher dimensions. the domain walls we will construct are formed in
vacuum, contrary to the usual cases where other elds are present, usually scalars. so
their formation is due to gravity. in particular, out of the domain wall, space-time is
ricci-at and all the energy is concentrated at the position of the wall. thus, our model
diers essentially from other similar proposals. in the model of randall and sundrum
(rs) for example [11], there is a bulk cosmological constant while in that of cohen and
kaplan scalar elds [12]. in these models a massless four-dimensional graviton appears
on the domain wall due to the niteness of the transverse space as in the old kk literature
[14]. in our case, there is no cosmological constant or matter elds and space-time is
ricci at (or even completely at) everywhere except at the position of the wall. thus,

1

it can also be considered as a vacuum in heterotic theories. in the latter case there exist
bulk gauge bosons and one may also ask if there exist massless gauge bosons trapped,
like the graviton, in the wall. we nd that indeed both bulk graviton and photons give
rise to a four-dimensional massless graviton and photons with a discrete spectrum of kk
modes. gauge bosons in the rs case have been discussed in [13]. we also show that in
this scenario it is possible for a tev scale internal space.

2 novel vacua with non-compact dimensions

one way of constructing string theory vacua is to look for classical supergravity solutions.
as supergravity is the low-energy limit of string theory, supergravity solutions describe
accordingly low-energy string vacua. there will be -corrections as well as string-loop
corrections to these solutions but, nevertheless, these solutions will still be valid in some
appropriate limits. these vacua are constructed by solving the classical eld equations
with appropriate elds turned on. usually such elds are antisymmetric p-forms as well
as scalars like the dilaton, axion etc., which appear in almost all supergravity theories.
some of these classical solutions are interpreted as the d-branes of string theory. there
are also string vacua where the are no other elds, except the graviton, turned on. such
vacua are necessarily ricci-at

rm n = 0 ,

(1)

i.e., they satisfy vacuum einstein equations. solutions to the above equations with four-
dimensional poincare invariance are provided by m 4x where m 4 is ordinary minkowski
space-time and x is a ricci-at manifold. supersymmetry demands that x should be a
manifold of u(1)6, su(2)  u(1)2 or su(3) holonomy. manifolds with such holonomies
can be either compact or non-compact. we recall for example the case of the compact
k3 surface and the non-compact eguchi-hanson gravitational instanton, both of su(2)
holonomy. the four-dimensional plank mass mp is proportional to the volume v (x) of
x

m 2

p = m 8

s v (x) ,

(2)

where m 2
s  1/ is the string-mass scale. propagating gravity therefore exists in four
dimensions if the volume of x is nite.
in this case, x must be compact so that x
is either t 6, k3t 2 or cy3 depending on the number of surviving supersymmetries.
it should be stressed, however, that there are also non-compact spaces of nite volume
which, according to eq.(2) will lead to a four-dimensional dynamical gravity. such spaces
have been considered in the kaluza-klein programme [14] and discussed [15] in connection
to the chiral-fermion problem [16]. the drawback of non-compact spaces of nite volume
is that they suer from singularities. however, although singularities are considered in
general to be disastrous, there exist singularities which are quite mild in the sense that
they can be attributed to some form of matter. these are delta-function singularities

2

which may be interpreted as strings, domain walls or fundamental branes in general.
supergravity solutions with a bulk cosmological constant and such singularities have
been constructed in [17] our aim here is to solve eq.(1) with a non-compact internal
space x of nite volume and delta-functions singularities.

in ve dimensions the only solution to eq.(1) with four-dimensional poincare symme-
try iso(1, 3) is at space i.e., iso(1, 3)-invariance and ricci-atness implies at space
in ve dimensions. however, this is not true in higher dimensions. for example let us
try to solve eq.(1) in six-dimensions with the iso(1, 3)u(1)-invariant metric

ds2 = dt2 + dx2

3 + e2(z)(cid:16)dz2 + d2(cid:17) ,

where 0 <   2a parametrize an s1 with radius a and  < z < . eq.(1) is then
written as

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

(3)

the solution of eq.(4) for  is, up to an irrelevant constant,

rzz = r =  = 0 .

where  > 0 is a dimensionfull constant. the metric (3) turns out then to be

 = (z) =   z ,

 = 1 ,

ds2 = dxdx + e2z(cid:16)dz2 + d2(cid:17) ,

,  = 0, 1, 2, 3

(4)

(5)

(6)

with  = diag(1, 1, 1, 1) the minkowski metric. one observes that the metric above
is locally at since it is an alternative way of writing the metric of a at six-dimensional
minkowski space. indeed, the transformation z =  ln(r) gives a manifestly at-form
of the metric (for  = 1/a). for  6= 1/a, we get as solution the product of four-
dimensional minkowski space with a two-dimensional at cone since in this case there
exist a decit angle 2(1  a) for .

in solving eq.(4), we have made the assumption that both  and its rst derivative
are everywhere continuous. however, by relaxing the continuity conditions we may get
other solutions as well. for example, there exist piecewise at solutions in which  is
continuous but with discontinuous rst derivatives. such solutions are provided by the
choice

as a result, we get

(z) =   |z| ,

 = 1 .

 = 2   (z) ,

and the metric turns out to be

ds2 = dxdx + e2|z|(cid:16)dz2 + d2(cid:17) .

(7)

(8)

(9)

the sing  will be determined in a moment after we calculate the energy-momentum
tensor. the ricci tensor develops delta-function singularities. indeed, from eq.(4) we
nd that

rzz = r = 2   (z) , r = 4 (z)e2|z| ,

(10)

where r is the scalar curvature. thus, the metric (9) is again everywhere at for  = 1/a
(or locally at for  6= 1/a but now it develops a delta-function singularity at the point
z = 0. to see if this singularity can be attributed to some form of matter, we have to
calculate the energy-momentum tensor. the latter may be read o from

tm n =

1

8g6 (cid:18)rm n 

1
2

gm n r(cid:19) ,

(11)

where gn is, in general, the n-dimensional newton constant. by using eq.(10) we get
that

t =

1

4g6

e2|z|(z)

tzz = t = 0 .

positivity now of the energy-density,

t00 =  = 



4g6

e2|z|(z)

demands that  = 1. as a result, the metric turns out to be
ds2 = dxdx + e2|z|(cid:16)dz2 + d2(cid:17) .

(12)

(13)

this metric describes a string (string if we count the codimension of the object, or a
three-brane if we count its actual dimensions) with a four-dimensional world-volume in
six dimensions as can be seen from the form of energy-momentum tensor

tm n =  diag(1,1,1,1, 0, 0) .

(14)

it should be stressed that this three-brane is not the one of type iib theory since it is
neutral and, in particular, it does not carry any rr charge to justify its name. however,
it has a four-dimensional world-volume and for this reason we will call it three-brane.
the transverse space of this three-brane is a non-compact surface 2 with metric

remarkably, the area of the surface 2 is

ds = e2|z|(cid:16)dz2 + d2(cid:17) .

v = 2az 



e2|z| dz = 21a <  ,

and thus, a massless graviton is expected in four-dimensions as will see later.

(15)

(16)

2.1 supersymmetry

we will examine now if the background of eq.(13) is supersymmetric. in this case, the
gravitino shifts

m = dm  ,

(17)

where dm = m + m abab/4 is the spin connection, vanish for appropriate spinors .
we may split  as

where ,  are four-dimensional and two-dimensional spinors, respectively. we choose
for the gamma matrices the representation

 =    ,

(18)

 =   1 ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3,
z = 5  1 ,  = 5  2 ,

(19)

where  are four-dimensional gamma matrices and 1,2 are pauli matrices. the van-
ishing of the gravitino shifts is then equivalent to the existence of covariantly constant
spinors in the transverse space 2 with metric (15). in particular, the number of su-
persymmetries in four-dimensions is the number of independent killing spinors in the
transverse space 2. the killing spinor equation is

di = 0 ,

(20)

where di = i + iabab/4 is the spin connection in the two-dimensional space 2. for
the metric (15) the killing spinor equation splits as follows

z = 0 ,

(cid:18) +

1
2

21(cid:19)  = 0 .

the solution to eq.(22) for  is given by

 = (cid:18)(z)(cid:16)2 cos


2

 + 1 sin


2

(cid:17) + (z)(cid:16) cos


2

  12 sin


2

(cid:17)(cid:19) 0 ,

(21)

(22)

(23)

where (z) = 0, 1 for z < 0, z > 0, respectively is the step function and 0 is a two-
component constant spinor. substituting eq.(23) back in eq.(21), we get

z = (z)(cid:18)1  2(cid:19)(cid:18)cos


2

  1 sin


2

(cid:19) 0 .

(24)

the matrix (1  2) has one zero eigenvalue and thus, there exist only one covariant
constant spinor localized at z = 0. therefore, the solution we found breaks half of the
supersymmetries. the non-zero eigenvalue of z is the golstone fermion and lives only
inside the wall due to the delta function.

3 domain walls in higer dimensions

we have seen that the conditions of four-dimensional poincare invariance and ricci-
atness lead, in six dimensions, to three-brane like solutions. this construction can be
generalized to higher dimensions. here we will consider an n+4-dimensional space-time
of the form m 1,3  x n with metric
ds2 = dt2 + dx2

3 + e2(z)(cid:16)dz2 + d2(cid:17) ,

(25)

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

where

d = kij(y)dyidyj ,

(26)

is the metric of an n1-dimensional space . the ricci tensor for the metric (25) is

r = 0 ,
rzz = (n  1) ,
rij = r(k)ij  kij  (n  2)2kij ,

where r(k)ij is the ricci tensor of the space . eq.(1) is then satised by

 =   z ,

 = 1 ,
r(k)ij = (n  2)2kij ,

(27)

(28)

so that the space  is a einstein space of positive constant scalar curvature (n1)(n
2)2.  can be any compact einstein space and, in particular, the solution is at n+4-
dimensional space-time if  is the round sphere sn1 with radius 1/ .

as in the six-dimensional case we discussed before, we may take  to be continuous
but with discontinuous rst derivatives. in this case  is given by eq.(7) and the metric
turns out to be

ds2 = dxdx + e2|z|(cid:16)dz2 + kijdyidyj(cid:17) .

(29)

here again, the space is everywhere ricci-at except at the point z = 0 where it develops
a delta-function singularity such that

r = 0 , rij = 2   (z) kij , rzz = 2(n  1)   (z) .
the energy-momentum tensor can be calculated from eq.(11) and we nd



4g(n+4)



4g(n+4)

e2|z|(z)

e2|z|(z)kij ,

t = (n  1)

tij = (n  2)
tzz = 0 .

6

(30)

(31)

positivity of the energy-density requires again  = 1 and from the form of the energy-
momentum tensor we see that the solution

ds2 = dxdx + e2|z|(cid:16)dz2 + kijdyidyj(cid:17) ,

(32)

represents a domain wall at z = 0. this domain wall however, is not a at n + 3-
dimensional minkowski space-time m 1,n+2 as in the usual case but rather is of m 1,3
topology. in a sense it may be viewed as a compactied at minkowski space-time on a
compact einstein space  as in the old kaluza-klein programme. the transverse space
x n to the four-dimensional minkowski space-time has metric

and its volume is

ds2 = e2|z|(cid:16)dz2 + kijdyidyj(cid:17) ,

v = v ()z 



en|z|dz =

2
n

v ()1 <  ,

which is again nite.

(33)

(34)

4 the bosonic spectrum

we will examine now the spectrum of small uctuations of the bulk elds. as usual, the
bulk elds are the graviton, scalars (like dilaton or axions), gauge elds, antisymmetric
tensor elds, fermions and gravitinos. we will discuss here the case of bulk graviton and
gauge elds.

to study the spectrum, we need certain hodge-de rham operators p in the n-

dimensional space x n. the action of the latter on scalars y and one-forms ym is

0y = mmy ,
1ym = ppym + rm

pyp ,

m, k, p, q = 1, ..., n .

(35)

another operator which is involved in the discussion is the lichnerowitz operator l
which acts on traceless transverse symmetric two-tensors as

lhmk = pphmk + rm

phkp + rk

phmp  2rmpkqhpq .

(36)

next we need the eigenvalues of the hodge-de rham and lichnerowitz operators p and
l, respectively on the space x. we will work out explicitly the eigenvalue problem
for the laplace operator 0 which is directly involved in the discussion for massless
four-dimensional gravitons, whereas for the rest, we will nd bounds on their lowest
eigenvalue. for simplicity, we will assume that the metric of x is

ds2

 = e2|z| dz2 +

1
2 d2

n1! ,

(37)

7

n1 is the metric on the unit n1-sphere sn1. thus, away from the z = 0
where d2
point, the transverse space is at n-dimensional euclidean space and all the curvature is
at the z = 0 point.

we will rst consider the scalar laplacian 0 and its eingenvalue problem

by writing

0y = m 2y .

y(yi, z) = e(n2)|z|/2z(z)(yi) ,

(38)

(39)

where (yi) are the eigenfunctions of the scalar laplacian 0(sn1) on the unit sn1
with eigenvalues ( + n  1)

0(sn1) = (+n2) ,

 = 0, 1, ...

we get from eq.(38) that z(z) satises

d2

dz2 z + (n  2)2

4

2 + (+n2)2  (n  2)(z)! z = m 2e2|z|z .



(40)

(41)

the problem has been reduced to an one-dimensional schrodinger equation with potential

v (z) =  (n2)2

4

+ (+n2)! 2 (n2)  (z) .

(42)

in general, an attractive potential v (z) = g2(z) supports a single bound state of energy
g2/4. we see that this bound state satises eq.(41) for  = 0 and m = 0. as a result,
the four-dimensional massless graviton is just the unique bound state of the potential
(42). to nd the rest of the spectrum, we have to solve eq.(41) with appropriate boundary
conditions. if we denote by z+(z), z(z) the solution for z > 0, z < 0, respectively, the
boundary conditions are

z+(0) = z(0) = z(0) ,
z 
+(0)  z 

(0) = (n  2)z(0) ,

(43)

(44)

where prime denotes dierentiation with respect to z(=d/dz). in addition, there exist
one more relation z has to satisfy, namely,

e(n2)zz+(z)z 

+(z)|z=  e(n2)zz(z)z 

(z)|z= = 0 ,

(45)

which is just the condition of conservation of the current j p = zpz on the transverse
space, i.e.,

z dzdn1y p(cid:16)e(n2)|z|hzpz(cid:17) .

(46)

8

continuity of z eq.(44) and the condition eq.(45), specify the solutions to be, up to a
multiplicative constants,

z+(z) = m (2n)/2j(cid:16)m
z(z) = m (2n)/2j(cid:16)m





where j are the bessel functions with

 =

2 + n  2

2

.

ez(cid:17) ,
ez(cid:17) ,

(47)

(48)

the factor m (2n)/2 in eq.(47) has been inserted in order the limit m  0 to give the
zero-mode eigenfunction

z0(z)  exp(n2)|z| .

(49)

the other solution to eq.(41) the second bessel function y fails to satisfy eq.(45). finally,
from the last condition eq.(44), we get

m


j 

(cid:16)m
 (cid:17) =

n  2

2

j(cid:16)m
 (cid:17) ,

which can be written, after using bessel-function identities, as

m


j+n/2(cid:16) m

 (cid:17) = j1+n/2(cid:16)m
 (cid:17) .

(50)

(51)

thus, the spectrum is mk, where mk, satises eq.(51). in particular, for  = 0, we nd
that mk,0 is

mk,0 = j(k)

n/2 , m0,0 = 0 ,

k = 1, 2... ,

(52)

where jk
n/2 are the zeros of jn/2. note that m0,0 = 0 corresponds to the bound state
we found before.
it should be noted that for  6= 0, the value m = 0 which solves
eq.(51), gives z(z) = 0 and thus, there exist only zero eigenvalue m0,0 with corresponding
eigenfunction (49). the spectrum of 0 is given in table (53)

eigenvalues of 0 dim of so(n  1)

j(k)
n/2
mk, ,  6= 0

1

(2+n2)(+n3)!

(n2)!!

(53)

in particular, for the n = 2 case, where the transverse space is 2 with metric (15),

eq.(41) is written as

d2
dz2 z + 22z = m 2e2|z|z .



(54)

9

the solution is then

z+(z) = j(cid:16) m



ez(cid:17) ,

z(z) = j(cid:16) m



ez(cid:17) ,

while the eigenvalues (38) are specied by

m


j+1(cid:16)m

 (cid:17) = j(cid:16)m
 (cid:17) .

(55)

(56)

the  = 0 tower consists of the zeroes of j1 and the massless mode is the x = 0 of the
equation j1(x) = 0. the rest of the spectrum is obtained by solving eq.(56).

concerning the operator 1, it is not dicult to verify that its eigenvalues m 2

1 are

strictly positive, i.e., m 2

1 > 0 for n  2. indeed, from the eigenvalue problem

 ppym + rmpy p = m 2

1 ym ,

we see, by multiplying both sides with y 

m and integrating over x that

m 2

1 

1

my m|2 z rmpy py m ,
|y 

my m|2 = z y 
|y 

my m .

since now rmp is a strictly positive matrix, we see that there is no zero eigenvalue.

(57)

(58)

4.1 graviton

in order to nd the spectrum of small uctuations around the background metric gm n
of (32) we write gm n = gm n + gm n and we keep only linear terms in gm n = hm n in
the equation

then, we get that hm n (x, yi, z) satises the equation

rm n (g + h) = 0 .

(60)

where m is the covariant derivative with respect to the background metric (32). we
may express the components of hm n as

h(x, y) = h(x)y (y) ,

hn(x, y) = b(x)yn(y) ,

hmn(x, y) = v (x)ymn(y) +

1
n

gmnu(x)y (y) ,

(61)

where y (y), ym(y) have been dened in eqs(38,57), and ymn(y) is transverse traceless.
we see from the expansion (61) that we get in four dimensions a symmetric tensor eld

10

h which contains the graviton, a vector b and the scalars u, v . we are particular
interested for massless four dimensional elds and we will examine if there are such
massless modes. due to the invariance

we may impose n + 4 conditions on hm n which we choose to be

gm n = m n + n m

mhm = 0 , mhmn =

1
n

gmnmhk

k .

by using the expansion (61), we get from the () component of eq.(60)

h  h

 = m 2h ,

while from the (, n) components we get, among others,

b = m 2

1 b ,

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

eq.(64) is the equation for the four-dimensional graviton while eq.(65) is the equation
for the kk vector b. since m 2 is the eigenvalues of the scalar laplacian in x n which,
as we have seen has a zero mode, a massless graviton always exists and it is the unique
bound state in the attractive delta-function potential of eq.(42). the kk modes of the
four-dimensional graviton have masses given in table (53). on the other hand, the kk
vector b is massive since the operator 1 does not have a zero eigenvalue. proceeding
as above for the scalars, we nd that they are massive. thus, the only massless mode in
four-dimensions of the higher-dimensional bulk graviton is the four-dimensional graviton.

the massive kk modes of the graviton will aect the newton law as usual generating
yukawa-type corrections [4, 18, 19]. the gravitational potential where also the massive
kk modes of the graviton are taken into account is given by [19]

v (r) = 

1

r xk

dkemkr ,

(66)

where dk is the degeneracy of the k-th massive kk state. note that the degeneracy is
due to the so(n  1) invariance and the range is set by the mass of the rst kk state
which is proportional to .

4.2 gauge elds

let us now consider a u(1) gauge eld am (x, yi, z) = (a, ai, az) in the bulk geometry.
we will examine the spectrum which appears on the brane at z = 0 due to the bulk
gauge eld. the eld equations for the gauge eld is just the maxwell equations

m fm n = 0 ,

11

(67)

where m is the covariant derivative in the n + 4-dimensional space-time and fm n =
m an  n am is the eld strength. eq.(67) follows from the action

sn+1 = 

1

4g2 z d4+nxfm n f m n .

in terms of the gauge eld am and in the covariant gauge, eq.(67) is written as

 mm an + rm

n am = 0 , m am = 0.

by writing the components of the gauge eld as

a(x, y, z) = a(x)y (y, z) , am(x, y, z) = a(x)ym(y, z) ,

(68)

(69)

(70)

and recalling eq.(27) for the ricci tensor in the background (32), we get that a, a satisfy

(4)a = m 2

0 a , 2

(4)a = m 2

1 a ,

where m 2

0 , m 2

1 are the eigenvalues of the 0, 1 operators, respectively, i.e.,

(n)y = m 2

0 y ,

(73)

thus a massless four-dimensional photon exists if there exist a zero mode of the laplace
operator in eq.(72) while a massless four-dimensional scalar appears if the operator in
eq.(73) has a zero modes. from the analysis of the previous sections we know that
indeed the operator (72) has a unique zero eigenvalue. this eigenvalue corresponds to
a massless photon in four-dimensions which is the unique bound state of the attractive
delta-function potential in eq.(42). on top of this, there exist a tower of massive kk
states given in table (53). on the other hand, the operator of eq.(73) does not have
a zero mode. as a result, there is no bound state, no massless scalars thereof and all
four-dimensional scalars coming from the components of n + 4-dimensional vector appear
massive.

5 exponentially large extra dimensions

it has recently be proposed that the hierarchy problem, the unnatural smallness of the
ration mew /mp of the electroweak scale mew  103 gev to the four-dimensional planck
scale mp  1018 gev can be resolved in a higher n+4-dimensional setting. in such a
framework, mp is related to the n+4-dimensional planck scale mp (n+4) by

m 2

p = m n+2

p (n+4)v (x n) ,

(74)

where v (x n) is the volume of the internal space x n. usually, for a more or less isotropic
space x n of characteristic scale r we have

v (x n) = rn ,

12

(75)

where  is an r-independent constant so that,

m 2

p = m n+2

p (n+4)rn .

(76)

thus, as have been pointed out in [4], taking mp (n+4)  mew , the hierarchy problem is
solved if the scale of the internal space x n is large. for two extra dimensions for example
with mew  103 gev we get r  1mm. however, in such a scenario one expects that
r  m 1
p (n+4) as this is the scale in the higher dimensional theory. thus, the hierarchy
mew r ( 1015 for two extra dimensions) has still to be explained. this hierarchy can be
traced back to eq.(75), and as we will see here this is not in general the case. namely, we
will construct a vacuum conguration in which the volume of the internal space v (x n)
although by dimensional reasons satisfy eq.(75), the constant  is an exponential function
of r. in this case, even r  m 1
p (n+4), an exponentially large volume emerges so that no
hierarchy mew r appears.

we will consider again the metric (3) where now (z) is

(z) = 1|z + l| + 2|z  l| ,

(77)

where 1, 2 are, as before, dimensionful constants and 2l is the distance between the
two branes sited at l, l. it is natural to assume that all scales, namely, 1, 2, 1/a, 1/l
are of the order of the six-dimensional planck scale mp (6). the volume of the transverse
space is nite if 1 > 2 and in this case we nd

v =

2a1
2
1  2

2

e42l +

2a2
2
1  2

2

e41l .

(78)

the rst term in the expression above dominates and the four-dimensional planck scale
mp is then

m 2

p = m 4

p (6)v = m 4

p (6)

2a1
2
1  2

2

e42l .

(79)

for 1 = 2 tev ,2 = 1tev, 1/a = 1 tev, the value mp  1018 gev for the four-
dimensional planck scale is obtained for 1/l = 15 tev. the masses of the kk states
are now at the tev scale as was originally proposed in [2]
