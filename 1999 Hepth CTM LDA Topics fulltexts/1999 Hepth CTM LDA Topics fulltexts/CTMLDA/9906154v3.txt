abstract

we study 2 + 1 chern-simons gravity at the classical action level.

in

particular we rederive the linear combinations of the standard and exotic

einstein actions, from the (anti) self-duality of the internal lorentzian in-

dices. the relation to a genuine four-dimensional (anti)self-dual topological

theory greatly facilitates the analysis and its relation to hyperbolic three-

dimensional geometry. finally a non-abelian vector eld dual action is also

obtained.

i. introduction

2 + 1 general relativity has many remarkable features such as renormalizability, integra-

bility, topological invariance etc., which have been of great value as an heuristic guide in

the quest of the correct theory of the quantum gravitational eld in four dimensions (for a

review, see [1]).

these properties derive from the fact that 2+1 einstein gravity can be written as a chern-

simons gauge theory. this formulation is deeply related to the celebrated btz black hole

solution [2] and recently this relation has been of great importance in the further development

of the ads/cft correspondence [3], in particular in the ads3/cft2 correspondence in the

context of string theory [4]. in the ads3 case, in the context of topological eld theories,

this correspondence can be also realized as the well-known correspondence between a 2 + 1

chern-simons gravity theory on the bulk three-manifold x and the rational conformal eld

theory wzw2 on the boundary of this bulk (that is the cs3/wzw2 correspondence) [5].

in refs. [6,7] it was found that general relativity in 2 + 1 dimensions with cosmological

constant  is equivalent to a pure chern-simons gauge theory on an arbitrary three-manifold

x and certain gauge group g. x is locally homogeneous with curvature equal to  and for

deniteness we will take it to be given by   r with  a riemann surface. for  > 0, the
gauge group g is the de sitter group so(3, 1); for  < 0, it is the anti-de sitter group so(2, 2)

and for  = 0, it is the poincare group iso(2, 1). in ref. [7] witten showed, that there are

two actions associated to two dierent ways of parametrizing the invariant quadratic form on

the lie algebra of g; namely, the standard einstein action which characterize classically

gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions and the exotic one. it is interesting to note that each of these

actions gives the same classical equations, but their quantization is expected to lead to two

dierent quantum theories. topology change of space-time (with  = 0) was subsequently

discussed within this context [8]. some further developments of chern-simons supergravity

and extended supergravity were considered in [9]. applications of chern-simons gravity and

supergravity to the two particle scattering problem were studied in [10].

2

in this paper we will follow the philosophy of macdowell and mansouri (mm) [11] and

apply it to the 2+1 chern-simons gravity. within this philosophy, the chern-simons action

depends only on the gauge eld of the group under consideration. with the usual diagonal

cartan group metric and the identication of its components with the spin connection and

the vierbein we obtain the exotic action .

this 2 + 1-mm type of action is then naturally generalized by taking its (anti)self-dual

part with respect to the internal indices of the gauge eld. the procedure followed is similar

to that in a previous work [12], in which the 3 + 1-mm action was generalized for the

(anti)self-dual gauge eld.

it was shown there that this model is a generalization of the

plebanski-ashtekar dynamical action [13]. we show that the two dierent classical actions,

the standard and the exotic ones, describing chern-simons gravity, are encoded in the

(anti)self-duality of the internal indices of the structure group g of the frame bundle. this

(anti)self-dual theory corresponds, in 3+1 dimensions, to both the mm self-dual action [12]

and the plebanski-ashtekar formulation [13].

linear combinations of the exotic and the standard actions have been already con-

sidered in the literature [6,7,1416]. however, for this pure topological 2 + 1 chern-simons

theory, these two actions appear together by considering the (anti)self-dual action. it has

been previously shown, that for a pure 3+1 topological gravitational model [17,18], the same

kind of procedure gives the sum of the euler characteristic (x) plus i(x), with (x)

being the signature, in a way the euler characteristic seems to play the role of a -term

[19] (being both terms topological one could also say that (x) is a -term). similarly,

here the standard (or exotic) action will play the role of a -term. it is well known

that the precise relation between the classical topological invariants in four dimensional

manifolds w and the chern-simons invariant cs in its non-trivial boundary w = x is

through the atiyah-patodi-singer formula [20]

(w ) = zw

p1(w )  zx

cs

s,

(1)

where p1(w ) is the rst pontrjagin class of w i.e. rw t r(r  r), cs is the chern-simons

3

action and s is the -invariant of x. the restriction to self-dual (or antiself-dual) part of

the curvature in w , with respect to the group indices, leads to the atiyah-patodi-singer

formula of the form

(w ) = zw 

p1(w )  zx

cs

2

s ,

(2)

where w  denotes the space w with self-dual (or antiself-dual) curvature tensor. we will

nd in sec. iii that keeping this notion of (anti)self-duality some set of known data nd a

better understanding with these data correlated by this (anti)self-duality.

it is known from [7] that some quantum aspects of chern-simons gravity are related

to the mathematical description of hyperbolic geometry of the three-manifold x [2123].

in fact it was shown in [7] that the volume and chern-simons invariants v and cs, are

related to the standard and exotic actions respectively. however in order to distinguish

hyperbolic three-manifolds x with the same invariants v and cs, a more rened invariant is

needed, the -invariant [24,25]. in this work we exhibit that the -invariant is originated, in

the chern-simons gravity theory, from its relation to an (anti)self-dual topological gravity

theory in four dimensions. thus all invariants v , cs and s are encoded in a self-dual

topological gravity theory in four dimensions.

in previous works [17,18], we were able to exhibit eld theory duality actions, where

the dual action appears with inverted coupling constants (for a review of duality in eld and

string theory, see for example [26]). this was performed for a pure topological theory and

for 3 + 1 mm-gravity and supergravity. for chern-simons gravity, a eld theory duality

will be found in this paper, in the sense of rocek and verlinde [27], which also gives for the

dual action a non linear sigma-model of the freedman-townsend type [28], that in this case

can be further integrated to a chern-simons action with inverted coupling constant.

this work is organized as follows: in section ii we give an overview of 2+1 chern-simons

gravity. in section iii the consideration of the (anti)self-dual spin-connection (with respect

to the internal lorentzian indices) leads to the standard and exotic terms, which

emerge as a linear combination. also in this same section the correspondence with some

4

aspects of hyperbolic geometry is described. a dual theory to chern-simons gravity is

presented in section iv. in section v we nally give our concluding remarks.

ii. overview of 2 + 1 chern-simons gravity

in this section we will briey recall the basic structure of 2 + 1 chern-simons gravity

and the relevant structure of the elds, lagrangians and symmetries which we will need in

the following sections. for a more complete treatment see refs. [1,7]. in particular we will

follow the notation of these references.

in [6,7] it was shown that the 2 + 1 einstein-hilbert action with vanishing cosmological

constant is equivalent to a chern-simons action in 2 + 1 dimensions with gauge group given

by the poincare group iso(2,1).

in the case of nonvanishing cosmological constant  6= 0, witten found that the natural

generalization is given by the standard einstein action [7]

(3)

this einstein-hilbert action gives rise to two spacetimes, one for  > 0 whose covering

is a portion of the de sitter space with symmetry group so(3,1) and the other one with

 < 0 with symmetry group being so(2,2). there is another general action, which can be

constructed by taking the standard diagonal representation of the invariant quadratic form

of the lie algebra of the gauge group [7]. this action was termed the exotic action and it

is given by

i = zx

(4)

this action has the same classical symmetries as the standard one and for this reason it

can be added to the standard einstein action. classically, both standard and exotic

actions are equivalent. in a representation of the lie algebra where its generators are given

pa) for  6= 0, the connections are expressed as ai =
ea
i . for  < 0, the group so(2, 2) is isomorphic to

sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) and consequently it undergoes a splitting over the real numbers. for
 > 0, the lie group so(3, 1) does split as well when complexied, to sl(2, c)  sl(2, c).

the chern-simons action reads then

i = zx

in terms of the i the standard and exotic actions are written respectively as

(6)

under an euclidean continuation to go from minkowski space-time to the euclidean one,

the standard term is real and the only possible modication (for renormalizing purposes)

is a rescaling of the vierbein by the constant h. moreover, the exotic term should arise

as pure imaginary and the parameter k in its coecient should be quantized. finally it is

worth to mention that one can dene the euclidean partition function

z(x) = z dede i,

of the appropriate linear combination of the exotic and standard actions to be

i =

in the limit h  0, z(x) could ow towards a critical point where the
with k  z.
partition function would be described by two geometric invariants of the hyperbolic geometry

of three-manifolds: the volume v and the chern-simons invariant cs. these invariants are

described by the standard and the exotic actions respectively.

iii. the case of the self-dual spin connection

in this section we will work out the chern-simons lagrangian for (anti)self-dual gauge

connection with respect to duality transformations of the internal indices of the gauge group

6

g, in the same philosophy of mm [11], and of [12]. we will show that the two actions

standard and exotic arise in a natural manner. the action is given by

lcs = zx

(9)

where a, b, c, d = 0, 1, 2, 3, ab = diag(1, +1, +1, +1) and the complex (anti) self-dual
connections are

i =

1
2

(aab

i 

i

(10)

which satisfy the relation ab

cdacd

i = iaab.

we can compute the rst term of the right hand side of the action (9) and this gives

ijkaab

i jakab = ijk(

1

(11)

while the second part gives

(12)

thus using eqs. (11) and (12), the action (9) can be rewritten as

(13)

in this expression the rst term is the chern-simons action for the gauge group g, while

the second term appears as its corresponding -term. the same result was obtained in

3+1 dimensions when we considered the (anti)self-dual mm action [18], or the (anti)self-dual

3 + 1 pure topological gravitational action [17]. it is interesting to note that the -term

in these theories arise by means of the gauge group indices, taking the role that usually

the space-time indices have in the abelian [19] and non-abelian cases. normally for gauge

theories it is meaningful to have arbitrary coupling constants for the dynamical and the

-terms (as in the 3 + 1-d case [18] ), for that purpose we need a linear combination of the

self-dual and antiself-dual actions (9). this matter is further discussed in the next section.

7

one should remark that the two terms in the action (13) are the chern-simons and the

corresponding -term for the gauge group g under consideration. after imposing the

particular identication aab

i = (aab

i , a3a

i ) = (ab

i ) and ab

i = abcic, the exotic and

i , ea

standard actions for the gauge group so(3, 1) are given by

(14)

plus surface terms. these actions degenerate at  = 0, giving the pure so(2,1) chern-

+ +  lcs. in this
simons action. however, we can take a linear combination of them  lcs
way, the  in front of the standard term in (14) can be absorbed by a redenition of

the imaginary part of  . thus, with this linear combination, the  = 0 case gives us the

einstein 2 + 1 gravity without cosmological constant, plus a topological so(2, 1) cs term.

this action evidently can be rewritten in terms of the standard i and the exotic i

actions reviewed at section ii, eq.(8) as

lcs =

1
2

i  ii.

(15)

for so(2, 2) the same procedure can be followed. in this case the (anti) self-dual connections
ai are real, hence the action (14) is also real, as can be obtained by setting   . thus,
in (14), both cases  > 0 and  < 0 are encoded in the same framework, which permits a

simple analysis of three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

up to here we have worked with the minkowski signature. we can perform a wick

rotation and the (anti)self-dual chern-simons action (15) will be modied by a global factor

i, so the above action can be written as

lcs = i  i

i.

1
2

(16)

this is precisely the relevant linear combination of the standard and exotic actions used

to describe the hyperbolic geometry of x in the euclidean case, through the volume form v

8

and the chern-simons invariant cs [7,2123]. thus the euclidean partition function of the

(anti)self-dual chern-simons action (9) is itself a topological invariant

z(x) = exp(cid:18) v

h  2ikcs(cid:19).

(17)

this provides a more rened invariant than simply using the volume invariant v and it has

been proved to be a complex analytic function in the space of smooth deformations in the

space of the hyperbolic structures on x [22,23]. however, there is another natural invariant,

as we have seen, which is the -invariant which does not enter in the formula (17). the

-invariant is very important since it permits to distinguish two hyperbolic three-manifolds

with the same volume v and cs invariants, that is, with the same partition function z(x)

[24].

at this point one would be worried about the (anti)self-duality for the chern-simons

gauge theory because this concept is well dened only in four dimensions. this can be

easily solved by noting from eq. (2) that the (anti)self-dual chern-simons action (9) can

be naturally related to the classical topological invariants (euler and signature) of the four

dimensional spaces w  and the -invariant. thus the (anti)self-duality used in this section

is induced by a genuine (anti)self-duality from the theory in four dimensions. moreover the

needed -invariant can be extracted from the stationary phase evaluation of (9) following

[5].

there is another issue, which can be better understood also with the idea of the (anti)self-

duality in the internal indices. euclidean and lorentzian quantum eld theory of the chern-

simons gravity lagrangians, l and l dier by a factor i as we have seen above. from the

point of view of the geometry of x the change of the lagrangians are encoded in a change

of the orientation of x. from the pure topological chern-simons gravity point of view

both lagrangians are equivalent because the theory is independent of the metric of x.

this is not satisfactory because both actions amount to very dierent quantum theories.

it nds a nice explanation by using the (anti)self-duality inherited by the four-dimensional

theory on w . the reason is as follows: a change of the orientation of the bulk w i.e.

9

e0  e1  e2  e3  e0  e1  e2  e3 leads to a change of orientation on the boundary
e0  e1  e2  e0  e1  e2, for xed e3. in four dimensions the (anti)self-dual projection
implies the choice of an orientation on w . thus as we have seen this choice is preserved on

the boundary x of w and the choice of l or l corresponds to the choice of lcs in eq. (9).

some other new invariants are indeed necessary in order to describe dierent hyperbolic

three-manifolds with the three classical invariants equal [25]. the description of these in-

variants from the chern-simons gravity and supergravity point of view, deserves further

research.

iv. chern-simons gravity dual action

this section is devoted to show that a dual action to the chern-simons gravity action

can be constructed following [27]. it is worth to mention that for the abelian case a dual

action to the chern-simons action that does invert the coupling constant was worked out

previously by balachandran et al, in the context of the quantum hall eect theory [29].

before we proceed to show the duality of the chern-simons gravity action under vector

eld transformations we would like to describe our motivation for it. if one substitutes eq.

(6) in the linear combination ( 8) we get

with

i =  +i +  i

 =

1

2h  i

k

16

.

(18)

(19)

equation (18) has the typical form of actions transforming under modular transformations

sl(2, z) [19]. clearly the rst term in eq. (19) is the coupling constant of the gravity theory

(6) while the second term is a kind of -term. thus one can ask whether there exists some

modular transformation which transforms the partition function (7)

10

z(

a + b
c + d

) = (c + d)u(c + d)vz( ),

(20)

where u and v are the weights of the modular transformation. this would have importance

in the construction of further new invariants in the description of hyperbolic geometry as we

have seen at the end of section iii. in this section we will show that such a transformation

exists but action (18) is in fact self-dual under this sl(2, z) group.

we begin from the original non-abelian chern-simons action given by

l = zx

g
4

tr(a  h),

(21)

where h = da + 2

3 a  a and tr is a quadratic form in the lie algebra of the relevant
in what follows we will use the usual conventions: a = aab
i mabdxi,
ij mabdxi  dxj, where mab are the generators of the lie algebra of g and they
abcd the structure constants of the lie algebra.

abcdmef with f ef

satisfy [mab, mcd] = if ef

gauge group g.

g = gab

the invariant quadratic form on the lie algebra is given by tr(mabmcd) = (acbd). with

these conventions, the above action is written as

l = zx

d3x

g

ijkaab

i (cid:18)jakab +

fabcdef acd

j aef

k (cid:19).

(22)

now, as usual we propose a parent action in order to derive the dual action to (22),

ld = zx

atr(b  h) + btr(a  g) + ctr(b  g),

(23)

where as usual, b and g are lie algebra-valued one and two forms over x and a, b, c are

constants to be determined. in local coordinates on x, the above action can be written as

ld = zx

where

d3xijk(cid:18)abab

i hjkab + baab

i gjkab + cbab

i gjkab(cid:19),

hjkab = jakab +

1
3

fabcdef acd

j aef

k

.

(24)

(25)

it is a very easy matter to show that eq. (22) can be derived from the parent action. to

see that, consider rst the partition function of the parent action of the form

11

z = z dadgdbexp( + ild),

(26)

exp(cid:18) + i ld(cid:19) = z dgdb exp(cid:18) + izx

d3xijk(abab

i hjkab + baab

i gjkab + cbab

i gjkab)(cid:19).
(27)

one can integrate out rst with respect g. this gives

exp(cid:18) + i ld(cid:19) = z db(baab

i + cbab

i

)exp(cid:18) + iazx

d3xijkbab

i hjkab(cid:19).

(28)

integration with respect to b gives the nal form

ld =

c zx

d3xijkaab

(jakab +

a choice of the constants of the form

fabcdef acd

j aef

).

(29)

c =

g

,

a = b = 1,

(30)

immediately gives the formula (22).

the dual action ld can be computed as usually in the euclidean partition function,

by integrating rst out with respect to the physical degrees of freedom a

exp(cid:18)  ld(cid:19) = z daexp(cid:18)  ld(cid:19).

(31)

the resulting action is of the gaussian type in the variable a and thus after some computa-

tions it is easy to nd the dual action

ld = zx

the partition function is nally given by

z = z dgdbqdet(m1)exp(  ld).

(33)

12

in this dual action the g eld is not dynamical and can be integrated out.

if we

take the values (30) for the constants of the parent action (23), then the integration of this

auxiliary eld gives

z = z dbexp(cid:18)

(34)

as balachandran et. al. mention, in the abelian case [29], the elds b cannot be rescaled

if we impose periodicity conditions on them. thus, this dual action has inverted coupling

with respect to the original one.

v. concluding remarks

in this paper we have rederived linear combinations of the standard and exotic

actions given by witten [7]. an interesting feature is that both actions are encoded in

the (anti)self-duality of the gauge group g of the theory. thus both actions are obtained

from the chern-simons gravity action for the (anti)self-dual connection (9) of g. the usual

chern-simons action corresponds to the exotic one and its -term gives the standard

action. so to construct a linear combination of the chern-simons action and its -term

is equivalent to a linear combination of the self-dual and antiself-dual actions, as we would

have expected.

as a matter of fact, we have provided the justication of this derivation by observing

that the linear combinations of the actions i and i come from the (anti)self-duality structure

of the four manifold w when one is restricted to work on the boundary x of w .

furthermore, for the (non-abelian) chern-simons gravity action, we have found a non-

abelian dual action in the sense of [27]. this resulting dual action consists of a non

linear sigma model [28] of the freedman-townsend type eq. (32). moreover, after a further

integration, one can reduce this action to a chern-simons action with inverted coupling eq.

(34). it is interesting to remark that all these calculations are performed at the level of the

13

gauge elds aab

i

and its corresponding chern-simons action with a  -term. it is only

when we identify with gravity, that we come to the standard and exotic actions and to

a metrical theory.

the results obtained in section iii can be easily generalized to chern-simons supergrav-

ity. it is tantalizing to nd the supersymmetric extension of the dual action obtained in

section iv [18,30]. furthermore it would be of some interest to apply the results of this

paper to explore further uses of chern-simons gravity to hyperbolic geometry of x and

perturbative expansions of chern-simons theory with non-compact groups [31]. work in

these directions will be reported elsewhere.
