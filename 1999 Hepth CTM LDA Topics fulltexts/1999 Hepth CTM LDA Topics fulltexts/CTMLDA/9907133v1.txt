1/4 bps states and nonperturbative

couplings in n=4 string theories

w. lerche and s. stieberger

theory division, cern, geneva, switzerland

abstract

we compute certain (2k + 4)point, oneloop couplings in the type
iia string compactied on k3  t 2, which are related to the topologi-
2k+1jrql0ql0 on this manifold. their special
cal index tr(1)jl+jr jl
feature is that they are sensitive to only short and intermediate bps mul-
tiplets. the couplings derive from underlying prepotentials of the form
g [2k+4](t, u )  (v )2k ln 10(t, u, v ), where 10(t, u, v ) is the helicity
partition function of 1/4 bps states. in the dual heterotic string on t 6,
the amplitudes describe nonperturbative gravitational corrections due to
bound states of vebrane instantons with heterotic world-sheet instantons.
we argue, as a consequence, that our results give information about in-
stanton congurations in six dimensional sp(2k) gauge theories on t 6.

1. introduction

bps-saturated string loop amplitudes [17] play an important role since they
can give exact non-perturbative answers for appropriate dual formulations of a given
theory. the corresponding pieces of the eective action are often given by holomor-
phic prepotentials, and it is this holomorphicity which underlies their computability.
particularly well-known are the couplings in n = 2 supersymmetric string compacti-
cations that describe gauge and certain gravitational interactions. they are character-
ized by holomorphic prepotentials fg [8,9,10], which can be geometrically computed
via mirror symmetry [11] on calabi-yau threefolds. an analogous holomorphic struc-
ture arises also in certain eight dimensional string vacua [5].

however, a comparable systematic treatment for four dimensional string theories
with more, notably n = 4 supersymmetries has been lacking so far. the main novel
feature in n = 4 supersymmetry is the appearance of intermediate (1/4 bps) be-
sides the short (1/2 bps) supermultiplets. an example for a 1/2 bps saturated
amplitude is given by thr2i, which is perturbatively exact at one loop order in the
type iia string compactied on k3  t 2. it has been shown in [8,12,13] to be given
by the t -derivative of:

partition function on t 2 [8]. indeed f (t 2)

the k3 apart from the 24 zero modes, the result is proportional to the topological
(t, u ) is precisely what counts the 1/2 bps

states in the theory.

in the dual heterotic string on the six-torus t 6, the type iia modulus t plays
the role [14,15] of the heterotic dilaton: t = shet. thus (1.1) represents a non-
perturbative result from the heterotic point of view, where the shet dependence reects
contributions from 1/2 bps vebrane instantons [12].

 the regularization constant is   8
33

e1e , where e is the euler constant. in the type iib

string on k3  t 2, it is the u-derivative of this function what becomes relevant.

 1 

on the other hand, amplitudes sensitive to the intermediate, 1/4 bps states have
not yet been computed, at least as far as we know. it is the purpose of the present
paper to compute certain of such couplings at one loop order for type iia strings on
k3  t 2, and investigate their structure.

more specically, in the next section we will review some features of 1/4 bps
states in relation to the heterotic-type ii duality. in section 3 we will then discuss
(similar to refs. [7,13]) some facts about bps saturated helicity traces and their re-
lation to elliptic genera. in section 4 we will rst compute quartic couplings in the
moduli elds that are sensitive to the 1/2 bps states only; not surprisingly, their
structure turns out to be essentially the same as for the r2 coupling in (1.1). subse-
quently we will then compute certain sextic couplings, some of which will be sensitive
to 1/4 bps states. we will nd that these couplings are characterized by two pre-
potentials g1(t, u ) and g2(t, u ), which enjoy an intriguing factorization property.
in their structure they resemble borcherds-like sum formulas, with counting func-
tions given by the eisenstein series e2(q). in the subsequent section we investigate
these prepotentials by rewriting them in various ways, and also write down a natural
generalization of them that covers an innite sequence of (2k + 4)-point amplitudes.

finally, in the last section we will discuss the non-perturbative signicance of
these amplitudes when they are mapped by duality to the heterotic string. specically
we will argue that the prepotentials carry non-trivial information about instantons
on heterotic vebranes, and will also present some more speculative remarks.

2. short and intermediate bps multiplets

we will consider n = 4 supersymmetric compactications of type iia super-
strings on k3  t 2, or equivalently, of heterotic strings on t 6. besides the graviton,
the bosonic content of the supergravity multiplet in n=4, d = 4 supergravity is a

 some works that deal with dierent but related issues discuss topological amplitudes for six
dimensional compactications of type iia strings [16], and the counting 1/8 bps states of
type iia on t 6 [17]. moreover, counting 1/4 bps states in 5d black holes has been considered
rst in [18].

complex scalar (the dilaton shet) and six gravi-photons. in addition we have 22 vec-
tor multiplets, which contain each six scalars and one vector. in terms of the heterotic
variables, the bosonic part of the action reads (up to two derivatives, see e.g. [19]):

this action is manifestly invariant under so(22, 6, ir) [20], while the equations of
motion show a further invariance under sl(2, ir) acting on shet. accordingly, the

the mass formula for 1/4 bps states on this space is [15,21]:

m 2

2p[mt(m + l)m][nt(m + l)n]  [mt(m + l)n]2i ,

(2.3)

which involves the electric (m) and magnetic (n) charge vectors. the sign is always
meant to be chosen such that mbp s is maximized. the degenerate case, in which
the square root vanishes, corresponds to the 1/2 bps states [19]. hence these may
be viewed as specializations of the more generic 1/4 bps states that accidentally
leave more supersymmetries unbroken.

we will consider in the following only the subspace spanned by shet, thet and
. on this subspace we have

uhet, so that the relevant moduli sub-space is(cid:0) sl(2,ir)

+ shet(n1 + n2uhet + p1thet + p2thetuhet)

(2.4)

+ shet(n1 + n2uhet + p1thet + p2thetuhet) .

one can check that in the degenerate case, |z+| = |z|, these central charges reduce
to the 1/2 bps mass formula [19]:

z = (q1 + q2shet)(m1 + m2uhet + k1thet + k2thetuhet) .

(2.5)

 3 

note that the shet-independent terms of (2.4) and (2.5) coincide, which implies that
the perturbative states are at least 1/2 bps and thus that the 1/4 bps states are
intrinsically non-perturbative from the heterotic point of view. that is, there is no
perturbative calculation in the heterotic string that could possibly see the 1/4 bps
states.

however, as noted above, the heterotic and type iia compactications are dual
to each other provided [14,23,15] we exchange: thet = s, shet = t and uhet = u .
inserting this into (2.4) and (2.5), we see that at least some of the 1/4 bps states
do have a perturbative description on the type iia side, though certainly not all of
them.

indeed we cannot expect to exactly compute the simultaneous dependence on all
three moduli s, t, u in perturbation theory, in whatever framework. but what we
can do is to simply focus on the t, u subspace on the type iia side, while going to
weak coupling, s  thet  i. in this limit, further non-perturbative corrections on
the type iia side are suppressed. even though this will not capture the full story, it
will capture at least some of the non-perturbative physics in the heterotic string that
is related to 1/4 bps states.

the relevant physical states we thus consider are tensor products of the states
on the k3 together with the momentum and winding modes on t 2, characterized by

(2.6)

these states are 1/4 bps if either the left- or the right-moving component is a ground
state [24,18,25], ie., nl = h(k3)
= 0, where nl,r denotes the
oscillator number and h(k3)
the mass of excitations on the k3. that is,
(suppressing any vacuum energy shifts) the level matching condition for bps states
reads

(2.7)

which exhibits the dyonic nature of the 1/4 bps states. clearly, the 1/2 bps states
correspond to both left and right moving ground states, and the level matching con-
dition is identically satised for the momenta (2.5) with ki = 0.

 we will however argue in the concluding section that the dependence of some amplitudes on
all three moduli can be inferred in an indirect manner, namely via the uniqueness properties
of certain modular forms.

 4 

3. topological indices and n = 4 supersymmetry

one-loop amplitudes that are sensitive only to bps states must certainly very

special. indeed they must be proportional to certain helicity traces [26] in which

all the long multiplets cancel out. to describe such traces, denote the helicity operator

by   j (st)

l + j (st)

r , where in each left and right moving sector j (st) = 1

the zero mode of the fermion number current ((st) denotes the light-cone space-time

2ih e is

part of the theory). then the 2n-th order helicity trace is given by

.

in order to recognize the saturation or vanishing of such traces more easily, it is

convenient to map them to the rr sector of the theory, in which this becomes a

simple question of saturation of fermionic zero modes. this map [26,27] is universal

for a given number of left- and right-moving supersymmetries and otherwise does not

depend on the background. for simplicity, we will write the relevant identity down

only for the left-moving variables, understanding that an analogous identity holds

independently also in the right-moving sector:

above, j (t 2) denotes the fermion number current in the t 2 sector and j (k3) the zero
mode of the u (1)  su (2) current of the n = 4 world-sheet superconformal algebra
that is intrinsic to a sigma-model on k3.

from this it is easy to see that in the type iia compactication on k3  t 2, we
need at least two current insertions in each of the left and right moving sectors in

 5 

order to get a non-vanishing result. this is reected by the factors of 1 that arise
when we evaluate the traces in the space-time and t 2 sectors:

is the elliptic genus [28] of the k3 surface. it depends holomorphically on q, which
reects that all non-zero modes in the right-moving sector cancel out due to world-
sheet supersymmetry.

via the identity (3.1) (which is due to space-time supersymmetry), this is simul-
taneously a reection of the fact that the long multiplets cancel out in the helicity
trace, independent of any deformations in the k3 moduli. while in fact the total
number of bps states may jump when varying the moduli, the weighted helicity sums
count eectively net numbers of bps states and so remain invariant. it is this index-
like, topological nature of bps saturated amplitudes what makes them special and
their modular integrals exactly computable [26,27].

more specically, for k = 0 only the (k3) = 24 left and right moving ground

states can contribute in the k3 sector, so that

b4 = 6(cid:10) (j (st)

gets only contributions from 1/2 bps states and this is what underlies the r2 coupling
(1.1) [12,13].

on the other hand, for k > 0 in (3.3) the states that contribute to the trace
consist of right-moving ground states and arbitrary left-moving states  from what we
said in the previous section, this precisely characterizes the 1/4 bps states. in this
paper we will focus mainly on amplitudes with k = 1, for which the following six-th
order helicity trace is relevant:

l )4(j (st)

r )2 + (j (st)

b6 = 15(cid:10) (j (st)

(3.7)

where we have used v

2e(k3)( 1

2 v, q) = e2(q).

the issue is now to identify physical amplitudes that contain these building

blocks.

4. 1/2 and 1/4 bps saturated amplitudes

as a warmup, we study quartic interactions of the t and u moduli at oneloop

order:

hv1 (k1)v2 (k2)v3 (k3)v4(k4)i ,

i = t, u, t , u .

(4.1)

we want to extract from (4.1) the kinematical factor (k1k3)(k2k4) (and permu-
tations thereof), which corresponds to an oneloop corrections a to the term
(13)(24) in the eective action. these amplitudes receive non
vanishing contributions only from the n sn ssector and not from the rn s, n sr
and rrsectors. we thus consider insertions of the moduli vertex operators:

v (0,0)
t

v (0,0)
u

2

(k) =

t  t
(k) = 2
u  u

: [z + i(ke)e(z)] [z + i(k)(z)] eikx (z,z) : ,
: [z + i(ke)e(z)] [z + i(k)(z)] eikx (z,z) : ,

(4.2)

in the zero ghost picture with z = pt2/2u2(x 4 + u x 5), z = pt2/2u2(x 4 +
u x 5),  =pt2/2u2(4 + u 5),  =pt2/2u2(4 + u 5). in this normalization

 which has previously been calculated in the z2 orbifold limit of k3 [13,7].

 7 

we have: h(z1)(z2)ieven = 1, h(z1)(z2)ieven = 0, and for the kinematics we
consider, the only nonvanishing fermionic contractions are those that lead to the
helicity trace b4 in (3.6). however, from the bosonic contractions:

r

hz(z1, z1) z(z2, z2)i = p2
hz(z1, z1) z(z2, z2)i = prpl
hz(z1, z1) z(z2, z2)i = prpl
hz(z1, z1) z(z2, z2)i = |pr|2 

(4.3)

z21 gb

(gb   ln||2), we have additional narain momentum insertions, whose contribu-
tions are crucial for modular invariance. the resulting modular integrals can be eval-
uated by using extensively the results of [30]. a typical example for a nonvanishing
amplitude is:

(4.4)
more generally, we nd that all the non-vanishing amplitudes are proportional to
(t, u ) (cf., (1.1)), which of course reects that the helicity trace b4 is sensitive

f (t 2)

1

only to 1/2 bps states.

now let us turn to more interesting scalar eld interactions at the sixth derivative

level. more specically, we consider the following type of amplitudes:

hv1 (k1)v2 (k2)v3 (k3)v4 (k4)v5 (k5)v6(k6)i ,

i = t, u, t , u

(4.5)

and focus on the kinematics for which each modulus i contributes one momentum
ki. this momentum structure can arise in three dierent ways: (i) fourfermionic
contractions on both sides, giving rise to the helicity trace b4, (ii) eight and four
fermionic contractions on the right- and left-moving sides, respectively, or (iii) four
and eightfermionic contractions on the right-moving and left-moving sides, respec-
tively.

 the third correlator may also contain a function [29]. however, it would lead to manifestly

noncovariant amplitudes.

 some of these integrals have to be regularized by means of subtracting the corresponding
eldtheoretical expression in the integrand. this results in an extra constant contribution.
the regularization may be avoided by an additional modulus insertion in the string amplitude.

 8 

the main technical issue is the evaluation of the modular integrals, which is not
entirely trivial and will be outlined in appendix a. performing these integrals, it turns
out that there are two types of nonvanishing results, one type displaying again only
1/2 bps states, the other however being sensitive to 1/4 bps states. as an example
for the rst type, consider

where  can be any of {t, u}. since it involves the eight fermion contraction of type
(i), which gives rise to b4, this amplitude is obviously sensitive only to 1/2 bps
states. however, it can happen even for amplitudes with twelve-fermion contractions
of types (ii) and (iii) that only 1/2 bps states contribute. an example is given by
the following two contributions to the same amplitude :

manner, so that basically only the nonharmonic part of be2 contributes  this means

that again only 1/2 bps and no 1/4 bps states contribute.

summarizing, the rst kind of sextic couplings has exactly the same 1/2 bps

structure as the quartic couplings discussed above.

contributes (either of type (ii) or type (iii)), we see an interesting new structure
emerging. more specically, we nd:

 it is known [31] that some of the six-derivative couplings are related to the four-derivative ones
by eld redenitions. the similarity of the results in (4.7) and (4.4) may be partly related to
that. moreover, their kinematical structure coincides with some of the six-derivative couplings
that arise from expansions of born-infeld actions [32], and so may be also reproduced from
simple d-brane interactions.

one can easily check that there is no tree-level contribution to this kind of bps
saturated amplitudes, so they are exact up to one loop order (possible higher loop
and non-perturbative corrections are suppressed anyway in the limit that we consider,

12 , and the polylogarithms are dened

(1ez )2 . moreover the coecients are dened

2ql0i = e2(q)  1  24q  72q2 + . . . . (4.12)

note that since c(1) = 0, there is no singularity in the t, u moduli space and this
reects the impossibility of states becoming massless. note also that g1(t, u ) has
weight 2 under t and u duality, respectively, and indeed we nd that (4.11) and its
holomorphic/anti-holomorphic cousin can be rewritten in terms of a simple product
involving (regularized) eisenstein functions:

g1(t, u ) = 
g2(t, u) =

(4.13)

these intriguing identities exhibit a factorization that is not manifest in (4.11). we
can furthermore obtain both of these prepotentials (and their complex conjugates) by
taking mixed derivatives of the following function:

h(t, u ) = 6 ln(t2|(t )|4)  ln(u2|(u )|4) ,

(4.14)

which in this sense appears to be the fundamental generating function for the six-
point amplitudes we consider here.
it is the analog of the 1/2 bps free energy
f (t 2)
(t, u ) in (1.1), the dierence being that the ln s are multiplied rather than
added; by adjusting possible integration constants we see that h(t, u ) is essentially
the square of f (t 2 )

(t, u ).

5. prepotentials and partition functions

the prepotential (4.11) is one of the main results of this paper. it resembles the
borcherds type prepotentials that arise in other contexts [2,33,34,5], where non-
negative polylogarithms appear instead. however, that dierence is not important
and simply to be attributed to the mass dimension of the couplings.

the structurally more profound feature is that g1(t, u ) intrinsically mixes the
kahler and complex structure sectors, and this is specically tied to the 1/4 bps
states. indeed, when restricted to the subset of 1/2 bps states (which corresponds
to the terms with kl = 0), the sum in (4.11) nicely separates into decoupled pieces:

g1(t, u )

(kl)=0

(t, u ) + . . . ,

(5.1)

which in turn can be written manifestly in terms of the 1/2 bps spectrum using
[35,1]:

f (t 2 )

1

(t, u ) =  1

12 xm1n2n1m2=0

ln|pr|2 =  1

12 xm1n2n1m2=0

ln|pl|2 .

(5.2)



switching on all the moduli should promote ln(u2|(u)|4) to the logarithm of some

so(22, 6, zz) modular form.

 12 

we thus explicitly see that the mixing terms in g1(t, u ) (or g2(t, u )) correspond
to the 1/4 bps states and originate from the presence of e2(q) (or e2(q)) in the
integrand. its eect is to shift the 1/2 bps level matching condition, |pl|2 = |pr|2,
to the 1/4 bps condition: |pl|2 = |pr|2 + kl (or |pr|2 = |pl|2 + kl).

using the product representation (4.13) and the well-known sum formulas of the
eisenstein series, we can represent the prepotentials in a form that generalizes the

1/2 bps sum (5.2):

piece

24 g2(t, u )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) harm.

(5.3)
with m1 = n2m2, m2 = n2m1, n1 = n1m2, n2 = n1m1. since there are in gen-
eral many dierent {mi, ni} that contribute to a given set {mi, ni}, the coecients
(mi, ni) are in general larger than one, and this must be so since otherwise the sums
would be counting (just like (5.2)) exactly the 1/2 bps states.

moreover we can express the harmonic part of g1(t, u ) also in the following

manner:

g1(t, u ) =

1

4(cid:0)v

2 ln 10(t, u, v )(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) v 0, reg.

where 10 is the unique automorphic genus two modular form of weight 10:

,

(5.4)

10(t, u, v ) = e2i(t +u)ev yk0,l>0,mzz

(1  e2i(kt +lu)emv )d(4klm2) .

(5.5)

above, d(n) are the expansion coecients of the k3 elliptic genus that were dened
in (3.5). the appearance of ln 10(t, u, v ) is quite reassuring, since it is supposedly
nothing but the partition function of the 1/4 bps states [25] !

 we implicitly subtract here the singularity at v  0.

 13 

the second derivative in (5.4) just accounts for the insertion of j 2 in the helicity
trace, so that we can expect 1/4 bps saturated (2k + 4)-point amplitudes involv-
ing insertions of j 2k (cf., (3.3)) to be related to the corresponding higher deriva-
tives of ln 10(t, u, v ). in fact it is easy to see that taking 2k derivatives in v of
ln 10(t, u, v ) produces an innite sequence of prepotentials

the integrand in (5.8) corresponds to four-fermion contractions in the left-moving
sector, and 4k + 4 fermion contractions in the right. contracting less than 4k + 4
fermions on the right results in further contributions that derive from lower order
prepotentials g [2l+4]

with l < k.

this conrms the important role that 10(t, u, v ) plays as partition function of
the 1/4 bps states [25]. it is also known [36,25] that for v  0, ln|10(t, u, v )|2

 14 

reduces to the free energy f (t 2 )

1

(t, u ), thus giving a completely consistent pattern

that includes also the 1/2 bps sensitive four-point couplings with k = 0.

1

note that while f (t 2 )

(t, u ) has been written in (5.2) as a sum over 1/2 bps states
circulating in loops, it has also an interpretation in terms of world-sheet instantons
[8]; this is exhibited by the instanton expansion in the rst line of eq. (5.1). such a
view-point is indeed more natural in the path integral formulation, where f (t 2 )
(t, u )
is seen as counting holomorphic maps from a toroidal world-sheet into the target
space t 2.

1

the additional mixing terms proportional to e2ikt e2ilu , which are due to the
1/4 bps states, must have an analogous instantonic interpretation, however involving
holomorphic (and anti-holomorphic) maps that couple together both kahler and com-
plex structure sectors. such congurations can presumably be obtained via t -duality
from string networks [37,38], in which the 1/4 bps states have a simple geometric
representation.

6. non-perturbative results for the n=4 heterotic string

so far we have been dealing with perturbative quantities in the type iia string
on k3  t 2. the interesting issue now is to map these via duality to the heterotic
string on t 6, by identifying [14,15]:

+

4i
ghet

2  a + ie


t = shet 
2
s = thet  bhet
u = uhet  (ghet

45 + iq|ghet|
45 + iq|ghet|)/ghet
where thet, uhet correspond to the two-torus in t 6 = t 4  t 2.

44 ,

(6.1)

the perturbative t -dependence that we have been computing before will thus
give non-perturbative information about the heterotic string. remember that we have
been suppressing non-perturbative corrections in the type iia string by going to weak

 by correctly identifying the variables, we can map the mass formula for (wrapped) triple string
tpi ,qi = max{|z +|2, |z|2}. here,
junctions to the mass formula (2.6), ie., m 2
pi, qi are the charges of the i-th link of the junction, tpi,qi the corresponding tension and z
the central charges of (2.4). our results thus amount to counting such string junctions.

bp s =p3

i=1

 15 

coupling, by sending s = thet  i. this corresponds to the decompactication
limit of the heterotic two-torus.

more specically, while the kaluza-klein modes (labelled by mi in (2.6)) re-
main kk modes in the heterotic string, the type iia windings around 1-cycles of
t 2 (labelled by ni) turn into magnetically charged wrapping modes of the heterotic
vebrane around 5-cycles in t 6. alternatively, one may imagine wrapping the ve-
brane rst around the sub-torus t 4, to yield a string in six dimensions that is dual to
the heterotic string [14,41,42,15,24]. the type iia windings ni are then the same as
the windings of this dual string around 1-cycles of the remaining t 2 on the heterotic
side. in total we thus have dyonic bound states of wrapped vebranes of charge mi
with kk modes of momentum nj, which are 1/4 bps if m1n2  m2n1 6= 0 and 1/2
bps if the dzw product vanishes. the windings and momenta are exchanged by
s-duality, which is a non-perturbative symmetry from the heterotic string point of
view, but a perturbative one from either the type iia string or from the heterotic
vebrane point of view [19,43].

however, in analogy to the type iia side, it is more natural to interpret the
prepotentials in terms of instanton series. quite generally, world-sheet instantons are
mapped under the duality to space-time instantons, and indeed contributions of the
form e2ikshet correspond [12] to gravitational vebrane instantons that arise from
winding the heterotic vebrane around the whole of t 6.

as far as the uhet dependence is concerned (which simply describes kk exci-
tations), it is actually more interesting to convert uhet  thet, by making use of
the thet  uhet exchange symmetry of the heterotic string. the purely thet depen-
dent terms then describe heterotic world-sheet instanton contributions, and the mixed
terms in the prepotentials

 since we are at a generic point in the narain moduli space, where there are no non-abelian
gauge symmetries, this is the neutral heterotic vebrane [39,40] with zero size, or a small
instanton [24].

(6.2)

must therefore be due to bound states (or at least superpositions) of vebrane instan-
tons with world-sheet instantons. the remarkable factorization property (4.13) of the

(6.3)
tells us in particular that the vebrane and world-sheet instanton sectors that con-
tribute to these couplings must be essentially independent.

note that world-sheet instantons on top of a vebrane can also be viewed as
gauge instantons in the world-volume theory of the vebranes [44]. more specically,
it is known that a stack of q5 = k heterotic vebranes has sp(2k) gauge symmetry
[24,45]. accordingly it has among other terms:

z d6x(cid:16) b  tr

sp(2k)

f  f +

g5br

2

tr

sp(2k)

f 2(cid:17)

on its world-volume, the rst term being necessary for anomaly cancellation [46].
it is known [14,15] that the space-time coupling of the t 4-wrapped vebrane (or
dual string, that is) is equal to the world-sheet coupling of the fundamental string,
which means:
instanton on top of a charge q5 = k vebrane will give an additional factor of e2ilthet
besides e2ikshet , and this is what nally gives a particularly interesting physical
interpretation of the shet  thet mixing terms in (6.2). moreover the instantons must
break one-half of the supersymmetries on the vebrane, so that the total conguration
has only 1/4 unbroken supersymmetries.

2 =p|ghet|. comparing to (6.1), we thus see that a charge q1 = l

something non-trivial may then be learned for these gauge theories from the nu-
merical values of the coecients of the mixing terms in (6.2). since the k-dependence
of c[2k+4](kl) simply reects the weight factors j 2k+2 in the trace, the more fundamen-
tal objects should be the coecients d(4klm2) in (6.2), which are just the expansion
coecients of the k3 elliptic genus (3.5). in analogous situations such coecients
count either isolated instantons, or euler numbers of the moduli spaces if the instan-
tons are not isolated. most likely the coecients mean something similar here too,
and in particular carry information about the moduli spaces of charge l instantons in
the sp(2k) gauge theories on t 6 (the exchange symmetry in k and l, a consequence
of mirror symmetry on the type ii side, would relate this to charge k instantons in
sp(2l) gauge theories).

 17 

while we do not have at present a clear understanding of the precise meaning
of the coecients, suce it for the time being to recall that moduli spaces of string-
vebrane systems are typically given k3 (or t 4) and its symmetric products [18].
indeed the 1/4 bps partition function 10 in (6.2) is closely related [25] to the
generating function for the elliptic genera of syml(k3). therefore it seems reasonable
to expect that the cohomology of moduli spaces of l instantons on charge k vebranes
is encoded in 10, and thus in the physical amplitudes we have been computing. we
hope to present a more complete discussion elsewhere.

,

d(n)qm are modular functions of weights k, l,
respectively, and the integers obey r, s  0, q1, q2, q3, q4  0. modular invariance of
the integrand requires:

q1 + q2  r + s + k = 0
q3 + q4  r + s + l = 0 .

 18 

(a.2)

the integral (a.1) can be performed with the orbit decomposition method of [47]. in
the following we will discuss only the nondegenerate orbit i1, as the degenerate orbit
is trivial and has already been evaluated in ref. [30].

in the same reference, the nondegenerate orbit i1 with gl(q) = 1, fk(q) 6= 1
has been worked out as well. a general feature of i1 is that the t and u moduli
always appear in pairs in the polylogarithms that are either completely holomorphic
or anti-holomorphic, i.e., either (t, u ) and/or (t , u ) appear.

before we go to the general case, let us discuss the example fk(q) = 1, gl(q) 6= 1,

which is in fact what we need in section 4:

the presence of a holomorphic function gl(q) (which is in contrast to the usually con-
sidered situation) has as consequence that now mixed holomorphic/anti-holomorphic
pairs of moduli appear in the arguments of the polylogarithms, i.e., (t, u ) and/or
(t , u ). after introducing

the last equation represents the result for the nondegenerate orbit of (a.1). we see
that the amount of holomorphic/antiholomorphic mixing is determined by m = nkl
and is absent for m = 0. this reects in our context that 1/4 bps states can mix
holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors, in contrast to the 1/2 bps states.
