abstract

in a recent essay, we discussed the possibility of using polymer sizing to model the

collapse of a single, long excited string to a black hole. in this letter, we apply this idea

to bring further support to string/black hole correspondence. in particular, we reproduce

horowitz and polchinkis results for self-gravitating fundamental strings and speculate on

the nature of the quantum degrees of freedom of black holes in string theory.

susskinds postulate of string-black hole correspondence [1] represents the most

promising attempt to understand the physical basis of quantum gravity from string theory.

in its most basic form, it suggests a one to one correspondence between fundamental string

states and black hole states.

this correspondence was claried further in [2], where it was argued that by adiabat-

ically increasing the string coupling constant g a string state would turn into a black hole
at g = gc  n 1/4, where n >> 1 is the level number of a long, fundamental string state.
the string coupling takes this critical value precisely when the schwarzschild radius, rs,

becomes of the order of the string scale, ls. for couplings below gc, the picture of a string

state prevails, while for coupling above gc the black hole picture prevails. at this critical

transition point, the string entropy makes a smooth transition into the bekenstein-hawking

black hole area entropy law [3].

the authors of [2] took this correspondence a step further in [4], using a thermal scalar

eld theory formalism to study the size of the string state as it collapses from its initial

random walk [5] form into a black hole. it was then argued in [6] that these results should

also arise using the methods of polymer physics1. more recently, the results of [2] were also

reproduced in [8], and where some of the physical issues relating to the collapsing string

were further claried.

in this letter, we reproduce the results of [4] using polymer methods, making precise

the scaling arguments of [6] and thereby giving further support to string-black hole corre-

spondence. we also discuss the implications of these results to the understanding of the

underlying degrees of freedom of quantum black holes in string theory.

following [4], we consider a long, self-gravitating string at level n and adiabatically

increase the coupling g until the string collapses into a black hole. as noted in [4], the
string size at zero coupling (the free string) is initially given by rrw  n 1/4ls, where ls is
the string scale. the letters rw denote random walk, as the free string represents a

random walk [5] with n = n 1/2 steps (or string bits [7]). the total length of the string

is given by l = nls.

as argued in [6], this conguration may be represented as a random walk polymer

chain with self-interaction. there are n steps, each of length l, with ~ri representing the

position of the chain after the ith step. gravitational self-interactions start to become
signicant once g  g0  n(d6)/4. this can be seen immediately by noting that the
attractive potential

becomes non-neglible in string units only when g approaches g0. here we have used the

fact that the mean square average of the distance between steps (the radius of gyration
[9]) is proportional to the random walk size, rrw  n1/2ls. we then replaced accordingly
in the summation, up to a factor of the order unity (the precise numerical coecient is

not necessary for our purposes).

as in [6], we follow the calculation of [10] but instead of a self-avoiding delta-function

interaction, we consider a self-attracting potential u as above. for simplicity, we restrict

ourselves initially to the case of d = 4 spacetime dimensions (or d = 3 space dimensions).

the system is described by the generalized hamiltonian

where ~r(s) is the position vector of the chain at arc-length s (0  s  l). following
[10], we use the feynman variational procedure for the free energy of the chain. the trial

hamiltonian is given by

h0 =

and where q is a variational parameter. f is to be extremized with respect to q. straight-

where  is a number of the order unity. it is also straightforward to show that the size of

the polymer, the average mean square end-to-end distance of the chain, is given by

(8)

where q0 is the value of q obtained by varying (7) with respect to q and is determined up
to a factor of o(1). the variation of (7) yields q0l  g4n3, which implies

this nding makes precise the arguments of [6], and agrees with the results of [4].
particular, note that for g << g0, r2  nl2
while for g0 < g < gc, r  ls/(g2n), which agrees with the calculation of [4].

s, which is the random walk/free string result,

the above results can be generalized in a straightforward manner to the case of arbi-

trary spacetime dimension d = d + 1 (note, however, that the calculations are not reliable

for d > 4). in this case, the free energy is given by

where again  is a number of the order unity. the size of the polymer is again given by
(8). the variation for general d 6= 4 yields q0l  (g4n6d)1/(4d), which again predicts a

3

transition from the random walk at g0  n(d6)/4, although the nature of the transition is
somewhat more obscure [4,8].

the special case of d = 4 (d = 5) deserves some attention. here f  ql(1 g2n), so
that for g < gc  n1/2, f is minimized at q = 0, corresponding to the random walk, while
for g > gc, f is minimized for q  , so that r2  0, corresponding to a rapid collapse at
the transitional coupling, which coincides in this case with the critical coupling: g0 = gc.

this is again in agreement with the results of [4] and [8]. note that the ve-dimensional

case also corresponds to the expected behaviour for a string state winding around the fth

dimension, and whose collapse results in a charged black hole.

further agreement with the results of [4] can be seen by considering the temperature.

to leading order, t = th = 1/ = 1/ls, where th is the hagedorn temperature, so we

will compute the leading order correction. again, for simplicity, let us focus on the case
of d = 4 (d = 3). then at q = q0, f = (e  t s)  g4n3. using e = m  n/ls,
we obtain, to leading order, t s  n/ls(1  g4n2). since s  n throughout the adiabatic
collapse, this gives t  (1  g4n2)/ls. this again reproduces the results of [4], namely
that   h  g4n2ls  g4m 2l3

s  2g4m 2/h .

let us now see what our polymer-type picture says about the nature of the degrees

of freedom in the transition between the string and the black hole pictures. consider the

entropy s of the polymer string in d = 4 (the arguments are similar in other dimensions in

which the above transition makes sense). at zero coupling, s0  n, the number of steps.
this can be seen in the usual manner for a random walk by associating to each step a

a small whole number of independent possible directions (related to the number of space
dimensions) p. the number of possible congurations gives the degeneracy d  pn, so that
the entropy s = ln d  n.

in the intermediate range g0 < g < gc, the adiabatic increase of the coupling preserves

the essential degrees of freedom associated with the string bits. of course one no longer

has a random walk, but up to a factor of order unity, the string bits retain most of their

4

degrees of freedom.

for a black hole whose mass is equal to the excited string state up to a factor of o(1),

sbh = a/4g  r2
p , where lp = gls is the planck scale and rs  gm  l2
l2
p n/ls  g2nls is the schwarzschild radius. we may then rewrite the bh entropy as

s/l2

p m 

sbh 

n2l2
s  n2g2.
p

(11)

at the critical coupling gc  n1/2, the entropy makes a smooth transition to the
bekenstein-hawking area law form: sbh  n  s0. this makes sense, since we dont
expect any violent changes in the entropy in the process of adiabatically increasing the

coupling. it is interesting, however, that this entropy still represents a degeneracy of a

polymer system with n steps. this can be seen as follows: at g = gc, the size of the

collapsed polymer string is given by r  rs  ls, or the size of one string bit, or one
step. in order for n steps of size ls to t into a sphere of radius rs, the number of possible

positions to which each step can go must remain a small whole number, p. hence the
degeneracy again has the random walk form d  pn. of course, the polymer is no longer
a random walk, but the degrees of freedom still remain essentially intact.

what happens in the black hole picture once the transition is complete? in this case,

the area of the black hole is given by a  r2
be divided into n pixels each of area l2

s  l2

s  (1/g2)l2

p  nl2

p . so the horizon can

p . once the horizon forms, the degrees of freedom

associated with it represent independent quantum states2. again, only a small whole

number of possible states, q, is associated with each pixel, so that the total degeneracy
is given by dbh  qn, with the entropy given by s = ln d  n  sbh . so essentially
the random walk degrees of freedom turn into horizon surface degrees of freedom at the

critical transition point. another way of saying this is that the string bits project their

information onto the horizon.

2 the independence of the states is a result of the causally disconnected nature of the points

on the horizon.

what happens if we continue increasing the coupling beyond the critical coupling gc

and into the black hole domain? then the surface degrees of freedom should continue to

account for the area law entropy. this can be seen in two ways: in the rst way, we x the

mass while increasing g. this would necessarily no longer be an adiabatic change, and the
entropy would have to change. in this case, rs  g2nls > ls for g > gc = n1/2, and the
area a  r2  g4n2l2
p = g2n2,
which is equal to bekenstein-hawking entropy, sbh from (11).

p . the number of pixels is now given by k = a/l2

s  g2n2l2

the other way of extending beyond gc is to continue adiabatically. in this case the

entropy remains equal to the original random walk number n, but the mass changes so
that s  a/g  r2
m  n/(gls). it follows that rs  gm  s/m  ngls/n = ngls = nlp , and the
horizon area is a  r2

s/g  gm 2  n. this implies that m 2  n/l2

p , representing n pixels and a quantum entropy of n.

s  nl2

p  n/(g2l2

s), so that

the above results are in full agreement with expectations of the holographic principle,

namely that the degrees of freedom of the black hole can be recovered through projection

of the states onto the horizon surface. in conclusion, the above results not only indepen-

dently conrm those of [4,8], but also suggest that the underlying degrees of freedom of

quantum black holes in string theory remain associated with the original, stringy degrees

of freedom. this further strengthens the string/black hole correspondence conjecture [1]

by implying that in the transition to the strong-coupling limit, it is possible that the quan-

tum string states somehow retain far more of their nature from the perturbative picture

than might have been supposed. this idea, of course, requires further verication and

more precise calculations, but nevertheless points to the robustness of the string/black

hole correspondence principle.
