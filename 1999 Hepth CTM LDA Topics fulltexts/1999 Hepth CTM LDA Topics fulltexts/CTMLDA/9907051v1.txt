abstract

if the standard model is embedded in a conformal theory, what is the simplest

possibility? we analyse all abelian orbifolds for discrete symmetry zp with

p  7, and nd that the simplest such theory is indeed su (3)7. such a theory

predicts the correct electroweak unication (sin2  0.231). a color coupling

c(m )  0.07 suggests a conformal scale m near to 10 tev.

since, in the context of eld-string duality, there has been a conceptual shift regarding

the relationship of gravity to the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions we

shall begin by characterising our philosophy.

the descriptions of gravity and of the standard model are dual. in the string picture

there is a massless spin-two graviton but no manifest standard model: in the conformal eld

theory extension of the standard model, gravity is strikingly absent.

the eld-string duality may be claried by analogy to the duality between the regge

pole and resonance descriptions of hadron scattering. duality was very important in leading

to the veneziano model [1]. the two dual descriptions were complementary. by the study of

nite-energy sum rules [2,3] it was shown [4] that it was incorrect to add [5] the regge poles

to the resonances. at low energy the resonances provided an accurate description while for

high energy the regge poles became appropriate. the message from this analogy is that

the descriptions (occurring on the two sides of a nite-energy sum rule) are very dierent,

as are the dual descriptions of gravity (strings) and the standard model (elds).

the eld-string duality, one explication of which is in [6], is further illuminated by the

physics of the duality of regge poles and resonances. the theory of qcd [15] which replaced

dual resonance models [16] is known to contain approximately innite linearly-rising regge

trajectories bearing hadronic resonances, describable by a string. hence eld-string duality

is not surprising, and the relation of the string theory machinery to the real world is therefore

clearer.

until recently, a rst step to combining gravity with the standard model would have

been adding the corresponding lagrangians. but from the eld-string viewpoint this violates

duality. in the eld theory description [710] one cannot simply add the massless spin-two

graviton. indeed since we are using the eld theory description only below the conformal

scale of  1tev ( or, as suggested later in this paper, 10tev) and forgoing any requirement

of grand unication, the hierarchy between the weak scale and theory-generated scales like

mgu t or mp lan ck is resolved. moreover, seeking the graviton in the eld theory descrip-

tion is, to use our analogy again, like asking where are the resonances in the regge-pole

2

description [recall that schmid loops [11] were never satisfactory!] or conversely asking for

the high-energy behavior to be given by resonances in the direct-channel. both questions

equally elude a simple answer just as does the question about the graviton in a nite eld

theory.

of course, if we ask questions in a dierent regime, for example about scattering of

particles with center-of-mass energy of the order mp lan ck then the graviton will become

crucial [12,13] and the string, rather than the eld, description will be the viable one.

grand unication, with supersymmetry, leads to an impressively accurate gauge coupling

unication [14]. in particular it predicts an electroweak mixing angle at the z-pole, sin2 =

0.231. this result may, however, be fortuitous, but rather than abandon gauge coupling

unication, we can rederive sin2 = 0.231 in a dierent way by embedding the electroweak

su(2)  u(1) in su(n)  su(n)  su(n) to nd sin2 = 3/13  0.231 [9,10]. this will

be a common feature of the models in this paper.

the conformal theories will be nite without quadratic or logarithmic divergences. this

requires appropriate equal number of fermions and bosons which can cancel in loops and

which occur without the necessity of space-time supersymmetry. as we shall see in one

example, it is possible to combine spacetime supersymmetry with conformality but the latter

is the driving principle and the former is merely an option: additional fermions and scalars

are predicted by conformality in the tev range [9,10], but in general these particles are

dierent and distinguishable from supersymmetric partners. the boson-fermion cancellation

is essential for the cancellation of innities, and will play a central role in the calculation

of the cosmological constant (not discussed here).

in the eld picture, the cosmological

constant measures the vacuum energy density.

what is needed rst for the conformal approach is a simple model and that is the subject

of this paper.

here we shall focus on abelian orbifolds characterised by the discrete group zp. non-

abelian orbifolds will be systematically analysed elsewhere.

the steps in building a model for the abelian case (parallel steps hold for non-abelian

3

orbifolds) are:

 (1) choose the discrete group . here we are considering only  = zp. we dene

 = exp(2i/p).

 (2) choose the embedding of   su(4) by assigning 4 = (a1, a2, a3, a4) such

that pq=4

q=1 aq = 0(modp). to break n = 4 supersymmetry to n = 0 ( or n = 1)

requires that none (or one) of the aq is equal to zero (mod p).

 (3) for chiral fermions one requires that 4 6 4 for the embedding of  in su(4).

the chiral fermions are in the bifundamental representations of su(n)p

i=p
x
i=1

q=4
x
q=1

(ni, ni+aq)

(1)

if aq = 0 we interpret (ni, ni) as a singlet plus an adjoint of su(n)i.

 (4) the 6 of su(4) is real 6 = (a1, a2, a3, a1, a2, a3) with a1 = a1 + a2, a2 =

a2 + a3, a3 = a3 + a1 (recall that all components are dened modulo p). the

complex scalars are in the bifundamentals

i=p
x
i=1

j=3
x
j=1

(ni, niaj )

(2)

the condition in terms of aj for n = 0 is pj=3

j=1(aj) 6= 0(mod p) [7].

 (5) choose the n of ni su(ndi) (where the di are the dimensions of the represen-

trations of ). for the abelian case where di  1, it is natural to choose n = 3 the

largest su(n) of the standard model (sm) gauge group. for a non-abelian  with

di 6 1 the choice n = 2 would be indicated.

 (6) the p quiver nodes are identied as color (c), weak isospin (w) or a third su(3)

(h). this species the embedding of the gauge group su(3)c  su(3)w  su(3)h 

n su(n)p.

this quiver node identication is guided by (7), (8) and (9) below.

4

 (7) the quiver node identication is required to give three chiral families under eq.(1)

it is sucient to make three of the (c + aq) to be w and the fourth h, given that

there is only one c quiver node, so that there are three (3, 3, 1). provided that (3, 3, 1)

is avoided by the (c  aq) being h, the remainder of the three family trinication will

be automatic by chiral anomaly cancellation. actually, a sucient condition for three

families has been given; it is necessary only that the dierence between the number of

(3 + aq) nodes and the number of (3  aq) nodes which are w is equal to three.

 (8) the complex scalars of eq. (2) must be sucient for their vacuum expectation

values (vevs) to spontaneously break su(3)p  su(3)c  su(3)w  su(3)h 

su(3)c  su(2)w  u(1)y  su(3)c  u(1)q.

note that, unlike grand unied theories (guts) with or without supersymmetry, the

higgs scalars are here prescribed by the conformality condition. this is more satisfac-

tory because it implies that the higgs sector cannot be chosen arbitrarily, but it does

make model building more interesting

 (9) gauge coupling unication should apply at least to the electroweak mixing angle

sin2 = g2

y /(g2

2 + g2

y )  0.231. for trinication y = 31/2(8w + 28h) so that

(3/5)1/2y is correctly normalized. if we make g2

1 then sin2 =

y = (3/5)g2

1 and g2

2 = 2g2

3/13  0.231 with sucient accuracy.

in the remainder of this paper we answer all these steps for the choice  = zp for

successive p = 2, 3... up to p = 7, then add some concluding remarks.

 p = 2

in this case  = 1 and therefore one cannot costruct any complex 4 of su(4) with

4 6 4. chiral fermions are therefore impossible.

5

 p = 3

the only possibilities are aq = (1, 1, 1, 0) or aq = (1, 1, 1, 1). the latter is real and

leads to no chiral fermions. the former leaves n = 1 supersymmetry and is a simple

three-family model [17] by the quiver node identication c - w - h. the scalars aj =

(1, 1, 1) are sucient to spontaneously break to the sm. gauge coupling unication is,

however, missing since sin2 = 3/8, in bad disagreement with experiment.

 p = 4

the only complex n = 0 choice is aq = (1, 1, 1, 1). but then aj = (2, 2, 2) and any

quiver node identication such as c - w - h - h has 4 families and the scalars are

insucient to break spontaneously the symmetry to the sm gauge group.

 p = 5

the two inequivalent complex choices are aq = (1, 1, 1, 2) and aq = (1, 3, 3, 3). by

drawing the quiver, however, and using the rules for three chiral families given in (7)

above, one nds that the node identication and the prescription of the scalars as

aj = (2, 2, 2) and aj = (1, 1, 1) respectively does not permit spontaneous breaking to

the standard model.

 p = 6

here we can discuss three inequivalent complex possibilities as follows:

(6a) aq = (1, 1, 1, 3) which implies aj = (2, 2, 2).

requiring three families means a node identication c - w - x - h - x - h where

x is either w or h. but whatever we choose for the x the scalar representations are

insucient to break su(3)6 in the desired fashion down to the sm. this illustrates

the diculty of model building when the scalars are not in arbitrary representations.

(6b) aq = (1, 1, 2, 2) which implies aj = (2, 3, 3).

6

here the family number can be only zero, two or four as can be seen by inspection of

the aq and the related quiver diagram. so (6b) is of no phenomenological interest.

(6c) aq = (1, 3, 4, 4) which implies aj = (1, 1, 4).

requiring three families needs a quiver node identication which is of the form either

c - w - h - h - w - h or c - h - h - w - w - h. the scalar representations implied by

aj = (1, 1, 4) are, however, easily seen to be insucient to do the required spontaneous

symmetry breaking (s.s.b.) for both of these identications.

 p =7

having been stymied mainly by the rigidity of the scalar representation for all p  6,

for p = 7 there are the rst cases which work. six inequivalent complex embeddings

of z7  su(4) require consideration.

(7a) aq = (1, 1, 1, 4) = aj = (2, 2, 2)

for the required nodes c - w - x - h - h - x - h the scalars are insucient for s.s.b.

(7b) aq = (1, 1, 2, 3) = aj = (2, 3, 3)

the node identication c - w - h - w - h - h - h leads to a successful model.

(7c) aq = (1, 2, 2, 2) = aj = (3, 3, 3)

choosing c - h - w - x - x - h - h to derive three families, the scalars fail in s.s.b.

(7d) aq = (1, 3, 5, 5) = aj = (1, 1, 3)

the node choice c - w - h - h - h - w - h leads to a successful model. this is model

a of [10].

(7e) aq = (1, 4, 4, 5) = aj = (1, 2, 2)

7

the nodes c - h - h - h - w - w - h are successful.

(7f) aq = (2, 4, 4, 4) = aj = (1, 1, 1)

scalars insucient for s.s.b.

the three successful models (7b), (7d) and (7e) lead to an 3(m)  0.07. since

3(1tev)  0.10 this suggest a conformal scale m  10 tev [10]. the above models have

less generators than an e(6) gut and thus su(3)7 merits further study. it is possible, and

under investigation, that non-abelian orbifolds will lead to a simpler model.

for such eld theories it is important to establish the existence of a xed manifold with

respect to the renormalization group. it could be a xed line but more likely, in the n = 0

case, a xed point [18]. it is known that in the n   limit the theories become conformal,

but although this t hooft limit [19] is where the eld-string duality is derived we know that

niteness survives to nite n in the n = 4 case [20] and this makes it plausible that at least

a conformal point occurs also for the n = 0 theories with n = 3 derived above.

the conformal structure cannot by itself predict all the dimensionless ratios of the stan-

dard model such as mass ratios and mixing angles because these receive contributions, in

general, from soft breaking of conformality. with a specic assumption about the pattern

of conformal symmetry breaking, however, more work should lead to denite predictions for

such quantities.
