abstract

in this paper we obtain the c-function of noncommutative yang-mills theory

from the boundary counter-terms in its supergravity dual. for all backgrounds

we consider, the c-function is found to be monotonically decreasing towards

the infrared xed point, where it recovers the central charge of ordinary yang-

mills theory. for a background corresponding to nite temperature we nd an

overall reduction factor for the c-function, compared with zero temperature.

the holographic approach sheds light on the renormalization group ows in

noncommutative yang-mills theory.

i. introduction

yang-mills theory on a noncommutative space [1,2], or simply noncommutative yang-

mills theory (ncym), has recently received increasing attention in string theory community.

a few years ago, coordinates for coincident d-branes were shown to naturally promote to

matrices [3], signaling the relevance of noncommutative gauge theory [4]. later, ncym

was shown to actually appear in the d-string solution to the iib matrix model [5] and in

various string/m(atrix) theory compactication with constant ns-ns b-background [610].

this is not too surprising, because for a single d-brane in a background with constant gauge

eld-strength or rank-two anti-symmetric b-tensor, some appropriate limit should lead to a

situation similar to that of a particle in the lowest landau level, where the guiding-center

coordinates are known to be non-commuting. indeed in a recent seminal paper, among other

things, seiberg and witten [11] have explicitly identied the precise limit in string theory for

ncym to work, which is similar to the limit in m theory for discrete light cone quantization

of matrix theory to work [12]. in this way, ncym arises as a new limit in string theory,

providing a new probe to non-perturbative eects in string/m(atrix) theory.

in this paper we study ncym by exploring its supergravity dual. by now it is widely

believed that gauge theory is dual to a certain limit of string theory [13,14]; in particular,

type iib supergravity on an anti-de sitter background, say of ve dimensions, can be used

to describe a large-n supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory on the four dimensional

boundary, which is known to be a conformal eld theory (cft). one important test of this

ads/cft correspondence is the derivation of the quantum weyl anomaly of the boundary

sym, in a holographic manner, from the generally covariant counter-terms in the classical

boundary action of its ads gravity dual [15]. for example, in the case of ads5, the weyl

anomaly derived this way reproduces that of the corresponding d = 4, n =4 su(n) sym
theory on boundary, with the derived central charges having the expected large-n behavior.

it seems natural to extend this correspondence between gauge theory and gravity to

ncym. the supergravity backgrounds with non-vanishing b-elds that are supposed to be

2

dual to ncym have been recently suggested in refs. [16] and [17]. furthermore, it was

observed in ref. [18] that these supergravity duals can be derived from the seiberg-witten

relations [11] between closed and open string moduli, by assuming the running string tension

is a simple power function of energy. this observation suggests that one should try to use

the supergravity duals to explore the running behavior of ncym.

it is known that ncym is no longer conformally invariant, because of the length scale as-

sociated with the non-vanishing b-background. thus, one expects that the central charge

of ncym, dened as the coecient in its weyl anomaly, should run as a function of the en-

ergy scale. it should be interesting to calculate this function, the so-called c-function, and to

see whether it obeys a generalization of the famous c-theorem [19] in two dimensions, that

asserts the c-function is always monotonically increasing with the energy scale. the consis-

tent coupling of ncym to a curved background is not known yet, so it is not possible at this

moment to directly calculate the weyl anomaly of ncym. the goal of the present paper

is to study it in a holographic manner in the supergravity duals, thus providing constraints

and shedding light on the problem of consistently coupling ncym to a curved background.

the method we are going to use to derive the holographic weyl anomaly is a generaliza-

tion of the generating algorithm developed in ref. [20] for the surface counter-terms [21] in

the usual ads gravity. the point is that with a b-background turned on, the cosmological

constant of the supergravity dual of ncym is no longer a constant as in the case with no

b-background. thus we need to introduce a variable eective curvature radius depending

only on the holographic radial coordinate, and then use it as the expansion parameter in

evaluating the boundary counter-terms, simialr to the trick recently used in refs. [22,23] for

some asymptotically non-ads gravity theories. in this way, the coecients in the boundary

counter-terms become a function of the radial coordinate, resulting in a c-function depending

on the radial position, which in the holographic interpretation stands for the energy scale in

the boundary ncym [24].

the paper is organized as follows. in sec. ii we rst recall the dimensional reduction

of ten-dimensional type iib supergravity, in order to properly incorporate the contributions

3

of the rr-form and nsns-form backgrounds into the lower-dimensional supergravity dual

of the ncym under study. then we present in sec.

iii our generalized counter-term

generating algorithm, with a variable cosmological constant as the expansion parameter,

for evaluating the boundary counter-terms in the supergravity dual. shown in sec. iv are

the resulting c-functions for various supergravity backgrounds, corresponding to turning on

dierent b-backgrounds, one of which contains a non-extremal black hole. the nal section,

sec. v, is devoted to conclusions and discussions.

ii. dimension reduction of iib supergravity

in contrast to the gravity dual of ordinary yang-mills theory, the supergravity dual of

ncym involves turning on nontrivial dilaton and various r-form (anti-symmetric r-tensor)

backgrounds with a radial prole. to properly incorporate the contributions from these

backgrounds into the counter-term generating algorithm we are going to use, we have to

start with the ten-dimensional type iib supergravity and then to do dimensional reduction

carefully. the bosonic action for type iib supergravity in ten dimensions in the einstein

frame is

and m, n,   , are 10-dimensional indices. in the above we have adopted

hm n p = m bn p + n bp m + p bm n ,

(2.13)

and similarly for the other form strengths.

we now perform the dimensional reduction to (p + 2)-dimensional gravity by using the

following ansatz for the 10-dimensional metric:

ds2 = gm n (z)dzm dzn = g(x)dxdx + gab(x, y)dyadyb ,

(2.14)

with the indices {,  = 0, ..., p + 1} running on the reduced (p + 2)-dimensional manifold
m, and indices {a, b = p + 2, ..., 9} on a prescribed compact (8  p)-dimensional manifold
n . for the cases we are interested in, n is assumed an (8  p)-sphere:

gab(x, y)dyadyb = (u)d2

8p ,

(2.15)

where u is the radial coordinate later dened on m, and (u) is the jordan-brans-dicke
(jbd) scalar, whose radial prole will dictate the running behavior of ncyms c-function.

5

with the ansatz (2.14), the 10-dimensional einstein equations (2.6) decompose into

r + d = t 
rab + dab + eab = tab

(2.16)

(2.17)

where t is the trace of tm n , r and rab the ricci curvature in terms of g and gab

separately, and

d = gabrab ,

dab = grab ,
eab = gcdg(

ab

cd  

ad

bc) .

note that

d  gd = gabdab .

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

now we can construct the (p + 2)-dimensional einstein tensor g  r  1

2g r for
m from (2.16). with the help of (2.17) we eliminate d1, and get the (p + 2)-dimensional
einstein equations in the following form

g = t ef f

  t matt

 + t jbd



,

(2.22)

where t ef f


is the eective (p + 2)-dimensional stress tensor, separated into the matter

and jbd parts as dened by

(2.23)

(2.24)

1we decide to keep e instead of d, because the former does not involve the boundary metric.

later this helps to make the prole of the eective cosmological constant depend only on the radial

position, not on the boundary coordinates

6

the (p+2)-dimensional einstein equations (2.22) will be used in next section to determine

the radial prole of an eective curvature radius for the (p + 2)-dimensional background,

using which as an expansion parameter we will be able to determine the boundary counter-

terms for (p + 2)-dimensional gravity.

at this point we should comment that our eective einstein equations are equivalent to

the ones derived from the gauged supergravity action as discussed in, say, ref. [25] without

turning on the gauge elds of r-symmetry. in both their case and our present case, the super-

yang-mills theory on the boundary is deformed away from it conformal xed point, and the

renormalization group (rg) ows are driven by the jbd scalar  in (2.15). however, since

we are interested in the gravity dual of ncym, the 10-dimensional supergravity background

has already provided a nontrivial prole for  to drive the rg ow, without the necessity

of getting the gauge elds of r-symmetry involved.

iii. counter-term generating algorithm

above we have seen that in performing the dimension reduction from 10-dimensional

supergravity down, we have to include the r-form matter contributions to the right hand

side of the reduced einstein equations (2.22) as the eective stress tensor t ef f . in this section

we will show that with proper ansatz for the 10-dimensional metric, t ef f depends only on the

radial coordinate in the lower dimensional bulk, but not on the boundary coordinates. this

feature will then be exploited to generalize a systematic method that was rst developed in

ref. [20] for determining the boundary counter-terms in gravity duals. in the cases studied

there, the gravity duals have vanishing rr and ns-ns 2-form potentials and, therefore,

t ef f is constant leading to a constant curvature radius  for the non-compact part ads5
in the near-horizon geometry ads5  s5. then  was used as the expansion parameter
in determining the boundary counter-terms, which are holographically related to the weyl

anomaly of the dual yang-mills theory on the boundary, resulting in a constant central

charge for the latter.

7

in our present cases, turning on the r-form backgrounds makes t ef f have a nontrivial

dependence on the radial coordinate, while remaining independent of the boundary coordi-

nates. thus from t ef f we can extract an eective curvature radius ef f , with a nontrivial

radial prole, and use it as the expansion parameter to determine the boundary counter-

terms. again if one interprets these counter-terms as holographically related to the weyl

anomaly of the dual ncym on the boundary, one will obtain a c-function that has inherited

a radial dependence from that of ef f , representing the running behavior in the ncym, as

expected from the uv/ir relation [24] of ads/cft correspondence. in the following, we

will present the general algorithm that implements the above ideas; the concrete results for

various cases will be presented in next section.

let us write the metric g on the noncompact m in the adm form

gdxdx = n 2(u)du2 + mn(xm, u)dxmdxn ,

(3.1)

where u is the holographic radial coordinate and the indices m and n run from 0 to p. the

essence of the method developed in ref. [20] for pure ads gravity is to put the boundary at

a nite u-value, and exploit the radial gauss-codazzi equation for the boundary:

nng =

1
2

(mnmn 

1
d  1

2 + r) ,

(3.2)

where d  p + 1, and n is the unit normal to the boundary, mn the boundary adm stress
tensor and r the intrinsic boundary curvature. with the reduced einstein equations (2.22)
substituted in the left hand side, the radial gauss-codazzi equation becomes

nnt ef f

 =

1
2

(mnmn 

1
d  1

2 + r) .

in the case of pure ads gravity, the eective stress tensor is simply

 = d(d  1)
t ef f

22

g

(3.3)

(3.4)

with  the constant radius of curvature. since nnt ef f


is a constant proportional to 2,

then the gauss-codazzi equation (3.3) can be solved by iteration for mn, using  as an

8

expansion parameter. then assuming mn are derivable from local boundary counter-terms

in the action, the latter can be obtained by integrating the trace of m
m.

in general, when t ef f

 on the right hand side of (2.22) involves terms nonlinear in bound-

ary metric mn, the above iteration method will be inapplicable. fortunately with our ansatz

(3.1) and (2.15), we have

(3.6)

(3.5)

where  means taking derivative with respect to u. note that the jbd part does not involve

the boundary metric mn at all, and then can be absorbed into the curvature radius  to

get an eective ef f , which is a function of u only. for the matter part, we assume that

all the background matter elds are independent of the boundary coordinates, and that the

boundary metric mn for xed u describes a homogeneous riemannian space. then the

matter part (3.5) is a scalar on the boundary (at xed u), and it must be independent of the

boundary coordinates xm, though generally u-dependent. so the matter contribution (3.5)

can be also absorbed into ef f .

for this class of boundary metrics 2, we introduce the eective ef f (u) by

d(d  1)

22

ef f

 nnt ef f

) .

(3.7)

then using eqs. (2.22), (3.2) and (3.7), we obtain the radial gauss-codazzi equation

22

.

(3.8)

now one can solve eq.

(3.8) for mn by an iterative procedure, with the boundary

coordinate independent ef f as the expansion parameter. assume that mn can be obtained

from the variational derivative of the boundary counter-terms with respect to mn, namely

2the ones presented in [17] for the supergravity duals of ncym indeed all belong to this class.

(3.9)

then the boundary counter-terms are obtained by integrating the trace m

(3.10)

the detailed calculations that lead to this result are the same as those given in ref. [20],

only with 2 replaced by 2

ef f . the term of the order of 3

ef f has the correct form for

the weyl anomaly of a 4-dimensional quantum eld theory (qft). indeed, from the qft

point of view, the (d  4) factor in the denominator can be identied with the dimensional
regularization parameter . moreover, if we denote the o(3
ef f ) term of lct as l3, we nd
that under a weyl transformation w l3  l3 up to a total derivative and yields a nite
expression for the anomaly as   0. these are just the characteristics of a 4-dimensional
weyl anomaly counter-term [27], so the identication is unambiguous. the coecient in
front of the o(3
3
ef f as shown. we should, however, include the volume factor of the compactied 5-sphere
[15], vols 5  (u)5/2, so the c-function of a 4-dimensional qft calculated from its gravity
dual is given by

ef f ) term should be taken as the c-function, which is then proportional to

c4(u)  (u)5/2 3

ef f .

(3.11)

by holography, the radial coordinate u is interpreted as the energy scale in the qft [24].

an important consistency check needs to be done. namely, as mentioned in [20], in

addition to eq. (3.2), there is another subset of gauss-codazzi equations of the form

ngm = nnm .

(3.12)

according to the assumption (3.9), the stress tensor mn is conserved, so the left hand side

should vanish too:

ngm = 0 .

10

(3.13)

consistency requires that this be a consequence of the (p+2)-dimensional einstein equations

(2.22). according to eqs. (2.23) and (2.24), under the adm ansatz (3.1) the potentially

problematic terms in ngm are ntum and naum. the former is zero because of the

antisymmetry of the r-form strengths, while the latter vanishes after explicit calculation. so

eq. (3.13) is indeed satised in our generalized algorithm.

iv. c-function for noncommutative yang-mills theories

in this section we are going to use eq. (3.11) to evaluate the c-function of 4-dimensional

ncyms from their supergravity dual (with p = 3, d = 4). various iib supergravity solutions

for n coincident d3-branes in constant ns-ns 2-form background have been given in refs.

[16,17], and are conjectured to be the gravity dual of ncym. on the other hand, in ref. [18]

it is shown that the prole of the closed string moduli can be understood from the relations

[11] between open and closed string moduli, with a simple, running string tension. in this

section, we will calculate the c-functions case by case, and discuss the possible implications.

we nd that the running behavior in all cases is closely related to the prole of the closed

string moduli, and more importantly, the c-functions all decrease monotonically while owing

from the uv to the ir regime. the surface counter-terms we obtain in the supergravity

dual are naturally expressed in terms of close string moduli; according to refs. [11,18] they

can be converted to the open string moduli for the ncym.

a. case i (with only b23 6= 0)

the near-horizon background with nonzero b23 only is (in the einstein frame) [17]

ds2

e = 2u2h1/4{(dx2
h =

1 + a4u4 ,

b23 = ga22u4h ,

a2 = br2 ,

e2 = g2h ,

f0123u = 44u3h ,

(4.1)

11

where g is the string coupling in the ir limit u = 0, and r4 = 4gn, n is the number

of coincident d3-branes. here we have dened the length scale in the einstein frame by
absorbing 1/g into its denition:

2 =

r2
g  

4n .

(4.2)

we use the tilde notations to remind that the quantities have been obtained from the ones

in the full black d3-brane solution by the following rescaling

x2,3 =

b
 x2,3 ,

b23 = (


b

)2b23 ,

f0123u = (


b

)2f0123u .

because the value of b23 at the boundary u =  is /b, from eq. (4.3) we have



b = 

b =


b

,

(4.3)

(4.4)

where b and b are the boundary value of b23 and b23 respectively.

from (4.4) we see that in taking the decoupling limit   0, b must be taken to
innity to have nite and non-zero b. also if b = b = 0, then a = 0 and the near-horizon
solution (4.1) reduce to ads5  s5 as expected. with these comments in mind, from now
on we will always stick to the rescaled frame, and for convenience suppress the tildes above

the quantities.

the solution (4.1) has been proposed to be the dual gravity description of ncym with
b23 6= 0, and it reduces to the ads5  s5the gravity dual of ordinary yang-mills theory
for small u, which thus should be identied with the ir regime of ncym. we will see that

the running behavior of the c-function is consistent with this.

to calculate the c-function, we need to use eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) to calculate nnt matt



and nnt jbd



. it is straightforward to calculate the latter by identifying n 2(u) and (u)

from (4.1):

n 2(u) = 2u2h1/4 ,

(u) = 2h1/4 .

(4.5)

after some calculations, we nd that

12

nnt jbd

 = 5

22 h1/4(3  2h + 3h2) .

(4.6)

to calculate the matter contribution, we need to use the stress tensor expressions for b2,

a2, ,  and f5 given in eqs. (2.8)-(2.12). the calculation is tedious but straightforward.

noting that due to the self-duality (2.5), f5 is also non-vanishing on s5, and moreover [28]

f56789f 56789 = s f0123uf 0123u ,

where s = 1(1) for euclidean (minkowski) signature, we nd that

nnt matt

 = 1

22 h1/4(7 + 2h  7h2).

(4.7)

(4.8)

combining (4.6) and (4.8), from the dening equations (3.7) we get the eective radius

of curvature

2
ef f =

3
2

2 (1 + a4u4)9/4

1 + a4u4 + a8u8 ,

and from eq. (3.11) the c-function of the corresponding ncym

c4(u) = cir

(1 + a4u4)4

(1 + a4u4 + a8u8)3/2 ,

(4.9)

(4.10)

where cir  8  n 2 is the central charge at the ir xed point (as u  0), having the
correct large-n behavior of the central charge for ordinary yang-mills theory.

it is easy to see that c4(u) is a monotonically increasing function of u, so that the c-

theorem holds true. either in the ir limit u  0 or in the commutative limit a  0, we
recover the the central charge of ordinary yang-mills theory.

also note that the uv limit is divergent with the following asymptotic behavior

c4  u4 ,

as u   ,

(4.11)

which is not universal as we will see from the other cases below. it is also interesting to note

that 2

ef f  u   in the uv limit, implying that the reduced einstein gravity is eectively

asymptotically at.

13

one may also consider the counterpart of (4.1) with euclidean signature, then the matter

part of t ef f

 will be dierent from the case with minkowski signature, while the jbd part

will be the same, resulting in the c-function

c4(u) = cir

(1 + a4u4)4

(5 + 5a4u4 + a8u8)3/2 .

(4.12)

b. case ii (with both b01, b23 6= 0)

in the second case, both b01 and b23 are turned on, with the near-horizon solution in

the einstein frame with euclidean signature: [17]

(4.13)

where the length scale 2 and r2 are dened as before in eq. (4.2). the parameters b1 and b2

are associated with the boundary value of b23 and b01, respectively, as before in eq. (4.4).
again, the solution (4.13) reduces to ads5s5 for small u. and for large u, the einstein
metric approaches to r5s5, suggesting that the reduced einstein gravity is asymptotically
at. however, in the stringy frame the metric is again ads5 s5 for large u but with u = 
as the ads horizon not the boundary.

where cir is dened as before, the central charge of the ir xed point.

it is easy to check that the c-theorem is again satised, and the ir limit and the zero-

b-eld limit reproduce the expected result for ordinary yang-mills theory. in the uv limit,

divergent behavior of the c-function is

as u   ,

(4.18)

which diverges more rapidly than the one, eq. (4.11), in the previous case.

when a1 = a2  a in (4.13), it corresponds to a self-dual b-background [17,26]; from
 = 0, and the

eq. (4.14) we nd that the following matter contribution vanishes: nnt matt

c-function of the ncym in a self-dual b-background reduces to a simple power form:

c4(u) = cir (1 + a4u4)5 .

(4.19)

here h  (1 + a4u4)1 describes the prole or the running behavior of the closed string
metric as shown in [18].

c. case iii (nite temperature)

the third case we would like to consider is the gravity dual of ncym at nite tempera-

ture; for simplicity we consider only a self-dual b-background. as mentioned in ref. [26], the

matter contribution to nnt ef f

 vanishes in a self-dual b-background: the contributions

of  and  to the stress tensor cancel each other, and so do those of b2 and a2; moreover,

the f5 contribution to nnt ef f

 vanishes in the euclidean space due to the self-duality con-

straint (4.7). these continue to hold true in the present non-extremal background, so we

15

only need to consider the jbd part. the einstein metric is the same as that describes the

near-horizon region of a non-extremal black d3-brane with no b-background:

(4.20)

where a,  are dened as before.

the coordinate x0 is periodic and describes a circle of radius h = 1/th with th the

hawking temperature of the black d3-brane. the radius of the horizon uh is related to h

by the following relation [17]

u2
h = 22

h + q44

h  1/a4 .

(4.21)

there is a minimum radius (or maximum temperature) 2

h,min = 1/2a2, resulting in a

minimum radius of the horizon uh,min = 1/a2. this seems to be a slimitation set up by the

coordinate noncommutativity, and we will conrm this in the behavior of the c-function.

the calculation of the eective radius of curvature and the c-function is similar to the

above cases; we just write down the results:

2
ef f (u) =

2 (1 + a4u4)5/2

,

1 + a4u4
h
cir
(1 + a4u4

h)3/2 (1 + a4u4)5 ,

(4.22)

(4.23)

where cir is the central charge of zero-temperature ordinary yang-mills theory.

compared with eq.

(4.19), the above equation (4.23) shows that there is an overall

reduction factor, (1 + a4u4

h)3/2, for the c-function, due to the interplay between nite

temperature and noncommutativity. moreover, because of the existence of the horizon, it is

impossible to run down to the ir limit u = 0; the running must stop at the horizon u = uh

with the value of the c-function ct

4 (u = uh) = cir (1 + a4u4

h)7/2. it is curious to see if this

bound has anything to do with the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the black d3-brane from

the ncym point of view. also we note that because of the minimum radius of the horizon

h,min = 1, it yields a minimum reduction factor of 1/22 in eq. (4.23).

d. conversion to open string moduli

according to seiberg and witten [11], open and closed strings see dierent metrics; and

the open and closed string moduli are related by a set of denite relations. in ref. [18] it

was proposed that the radial prole of the bosonic moduli in the supergravity duals [16,17]

should be considered as running closed string moduli, which are related to non-renormalized

open string moduli exactly by the seiberg-witten relations, with a simple running string

tension. thus it is more natural to use the open string moduli to formulate ncym. in view

of these, the surface counter-terms we have calculated in the supergravity duals are actually

expressed in terms of the closed string moduli, so are the c-functions we have obtained for

the corresponding ncyms. one may need to re-express the c-functions of ncym in terms

of the open string moduli.

assuming that the anti-symmetric rank-2 b-tensor is already block-diagonalized, we can

restrict ourselves to only one block. according to the results in ref. [18], within one 2  2
block, the running closed string metric, gij, is related to the constant open string metric,

gij, by

gij = h(u)gij ,

(4.24)

where h(u)  1/(1 + a4
so in the simplest case when the b-background is self-dual, all components of the closed

iju4), with aij related to the boundary value of bij as dened above.

string boundary metric are renormalized with respect to the open string boundary metric

by the same running factor h(u):

mn = h(u)mn .

(4.25)

this is nothing but a global weyl scaling for the boundary metric, so that the 4-dimensional

weyl anomalies for open and closed string metric are related to each other by

w (c) = h2(u)w (o) ,

(4.26)

where w = rmnrmn  1
3r2 is the weyl anomaly, and the superscripts o and c refer to the
open and closed string metric respectively. we need to absorb this additional running factor

17

into the denition of the c-function for the open string metric, and it is related to the closed

string one by

c(o)
4 (u) = h2(u)c4(u) = cir(1 + a4u4)7 .

(4.27)

we see that the c-function dened using open string moduli runs fast than the one dened

using closed string moduli.

we can use (4.24) to extract open string c-functions for the cases with non-self-dual b-

backgrounds. however, the metric components in dierent directions will scale dierently,

and the global weyl scaling (4.25) is no longer true, so that the weyl anomaly of ncym

in terms of the open string metric will generally have an awkward looking. this is what we

expect for ncym, because of the anisotropy of a generic b-background.

v. conclusions and discussions

up to now not much has been known about quantum ncym. however, besides a direct

attack, the conjectured holography between ncym and gravity [1618] may provide helpful

insights into quantum ncym, in particular into its renormalization group running behavior,

by studying the classical gravity dual. this holographic approach is taken in this paper to

examine the running c-function of ncym, which is known to be a non-conformally invariant

deformation of ordinary yang-mills theory. we have derived the holographic weyl anomaly

from the boundary counter-terms in the supergravity dual, by generalizing a counter-term

generating algorithm [20] that is known to have worked well for usual ads gravity and

using a variable eective radius of curvature as the expansion parameter. the c-functions

we extracted in several cases are simply related to the radial prole of the bosonic moduli,

and satisfy the c-theorem that the c-function decreases monotonically towards the infrared

xed point, where it recovers the central charge of ordinary yang-mills theory. since now

there is no direct way available to calculate the c-function in ncym, our study does not

provide a test for the generalized holographic conjecture. however, our above results are

18

indeed qualitatively consistent with our limited knowledge of ncym and of its holography

with a gravity dual.

here we emphasize that we have been cautious so as to have taken an equations-of-

motion approach starting from dimensional reduction from ten dimensions. on one hand

this is natural from the point of view of gravity duals of ncym, all of which are known as

classical solutions of 10-dimensional iib supergravity. on the other hand, this is dierent

from the action approach that many have taken for the usual ads gravity in ve dimensions.

this caution seems necessary, since in our cases the gravity action in ve dimensions, from

which the reduced einstein equations (2.22) can be derived, is not a pure ads action with a

constant radius of curvature (or a cosmological constant). so the gravitational action for the

gravity dual as a iib solution should be calculated from the 10-dimensional iib supergravity

action. we have implicitly assumed, however, that the counter-term structure in this case

is the same as in pure ads gravity, with only the coecients in front of the counter-terms

acquiring a radial dependence. the assumption is self-consistent in our procedure, because

eq. (3.8) has no explicit u-dependence, and our iteration procedure is just the same as for

pure ads gravity. we leave it to future study to see if this assumption can be justied by

deriving the boundary terms in the 5-dimensional gravity action from the boundary terms

in ten dimensions.

also we warn that we have derived perhaps only (the metric) part of the holographic

weyl anomaly for ncym. it remains to see if the anomaly also contains terms involving

other bosonic moduli from either the open or closed string point of view.

in order to provide a stronger basis for the ncym/supergravity duality conjecture, the

weyl anomaly and the running c-function must be addressed from the quantum eld theory

side. the relevant issues include:

 first of all, how to couple ncym to a general curved background? and what is
the general structure of the weyl anomaly from the point of view of the open string

moduli? (our analysis in the text, even in the setting of closed string moduli, already

19

indicated that for a generic boundary metric, the terms nonlinear in the boundary

metric in the eective stress tensor may change the form of surface counter-terms.) in

particular, is there a generally covariant form for the boundary weyl anomaly in the

usual background dependent formulation of ncym?

 how can we understand the running behavior of the c-functions from ncym itself?
for example, if one could calculate the two point function of the stress tensor of ncym,

it will reveal the asymptotic running behavior of the c-function, and provide a strong

test of the ncym/gravity duality conjecture in comparison with the results obtained

in this paper. of course, a direct calculation should be dicult; a generalization of

the gkpw correspondence for the correlation functions [14] to the supergravity dual

of ncym would be more tactful.

 how to calculate the - and c-functions using renormalization group equations (rge)
in the quantum ncym? either in ncym directly or in a holographical manner, these

calculations using rge should provide better understanding of the holography between

ncym and their supergravity duals.

we hope to be able to address these issues in future study.
