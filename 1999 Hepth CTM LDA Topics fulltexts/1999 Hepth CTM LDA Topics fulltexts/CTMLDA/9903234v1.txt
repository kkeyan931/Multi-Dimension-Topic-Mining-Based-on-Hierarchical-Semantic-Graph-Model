abstract

we propose a type iib super-poincare algebra with so(2,1) covariant central
extension. together with so(2,1) and so(9,1) generators, a so(2,1) triplet (mo-
menta), a majorana-spinor doublet (supercharges) and a rarita-schwinger central
charge generate a group, g. we consider a coset g/h where h=(so(2)lorentz),
and the sl(2,r) 2-form doublet is obtained by the coset construction. it is shown
that u(1) connections, whose strengths are associated with 2-forms, are recognized
as coordinates of the enlarged space. we suggest that this is the fundamental alge-
bra governing the superstring theories which explains the iib sl(2,r) duality and
geometrical origin of u(1) elds.

introduction

origin of the sl(2,z) duality of type iib supergravity theory [1, 2] is still an unsolved
problem. possible geometrical origins of the iib sl(2,z) duality in d-brane theories are
examined in higher dimensional theories, such as 12-dimensional theory (f theory [3])
and 13 or 14-dimensional theories [4]. on the other hand, it is known that a hidden
dimension (11-th direction) appears as worldvolume u(1) elds on a d2-brane [5, 6]. it
is also expected that two hidden dimensions (11- and 12-th directions) are described as
two transverse components of worldvolume u(1) gauge elds on a d3-brane [7]. towards
the higher dimensional theories the worldvolume u(1) elds will play important roles in
exploration of the geometrical origin of the iib sl(2,z) duality.

in order to nd better understanding on this point, the superalgebra and the hamilto-
nian analyses are proper tools. the superalgebras (susy algebras) for dp-branes contain
central charges representing their ns/ns and r/r gauge couplings [8, 9]. susy central
charges, in general, arise from the wess-zumino terms or topological terms [10]. the
wess-zumino terms or topological terms in the dp-brane theories come from ns/ns and
r/r gauge couplings [11] where the ns/ns and r/r gauge elds appear as represen-
tations of the type iib sl(2,r) symmetry (sl(2,z) at the quantum level). concrete
expressions of susy central charges for dp-branes are given as the p-form brane charges
[10] and others depending on the worldvolume u(1) eld [12, 13, 14, 15]. for a d1-brane
the worldvolume electric eld corresponds to the ns/ns charge and the d1-brane charge
corresponds to the r/r charge [12]. for a d3 brane, the electric eld and the magnetic
eld appear in the ns/ns and the r/r central charges respectively in its superalgebra,
and in the hamiltonian its bps mass is obtained as the electro-magnetic energy [14, 16].
the analyses of the superalgebra in the hamiltonian formalism explain the bps mass
property of dp-branes as a consequence of worldvolume u(1) excitations [12, 14, 16]. it
is appropriate to examine the iib d-brane superalgebra to explore the geometrical origin
of the worldvolume u(1) gauge elds and the iib sl(2,z) duality.

siegel have constructed the wess-zumino term of n=1 fundamental string [17] using
a central extension of super-poincare algebra proposed by green [18]. the wess-zumino
term is given in a bi-linear combination of invariant forms and the lagrangian density
is invariant under super transformations by itself. recently sakaguchi [19] discussed
central extension of superalgebras inspired by works in [20] for p-branes. these extended
superalgebras contain new bosonic generators corresponding to brane charges and new
fermionic generators in addition to original super-poincare generators. using with the
algebras and the coset construction, he discussed the iia, iib and (p,q) string actions.

it is important to notice that the type iib d-brane superalgebra naturally ts with
the sl(2,r) covariantization [4]. the total momentum together with two vector central
charges associated with two second rank anti-symmetric elds b form a sl(2,r) triplet.
in this paper we propose an extension of the super-poincare algebra manifestly covariant

1

under so(2,1) = sl(2,r) :

{qa, qb} = 2i pjm (cm) (cj)ab,

[pim, qa] = i zia(m)

,

[pim, pjn] = 0.

(1.1)
(1.2)
(1.3)

here qa is the so(2,1) doublet supercharges, pj is the so(2,1) triplet momenta
operators and zia is the so(2,1) spin 3/2 fermionic central charges. it will be discussed
the identication of the so(2,1) with the sl(2,r) symmetry of the type iib supergravity
theory. we suggest that this is the basic symmetry algebra of the superstring and the
super d-brane theories.1

the organization of this paper is the following: in section 2, we propose the so(2,1)
covariant iib susy algebra and examine a condition from the jacobi identity. in section
3, the coset construction is applied to nd invariant forms. in section 4, the type iib
sl(2,r) representations are given in terms of so(2,1)/so(2) coset representations. it is
also shown the identication of the so(2,1) with the type iib sl(2,r). in section 5, the
so(2,1) invariant d-string action is considered in terms of the invariant forms. especially
we show how the u(1) elds are described in terms of coordinates in the enlarged space.
some discussions are given in the last section.

2 so(2,1) covariant central extension of superalge-

bra

so(2,1), which is isomorphic to sl(2,r) and su(1,1), is the lorentz group in 2+1

dimensions. the generators nij, (i, j = 0, 1, 2) are satisfying the lorentz algebra

[nij, nk] = i (i njk  j nik  ki nj + kj ni),

(2.1)

where ij = diag(1, 1, 1). the iib supersymmetry generators qa (a = 1, 2) are 10d
majorana-weyl spinors with the same chirality. we assign them as a so(2,1) majorana
spin 1/2 doublet,2

[qa, njk] = 

i
2

qb(jk)b

a,

jk 

1
2

[jk].

(2.3)

where (i/2)jk is the spinor representation of njk. as a consequence three 10d vector
charges pi appearing in the superalgebra (1.1), form a so(2,1) vector triplet,

[pi, njk] = i (ijpk  ikpj).

(2.4)

1it could appear higher rank tensor charge in (1.1) [4].

2 the gamma matrices in 2+1 dimensions are satisfying (cid:8)i, j(cid:9) = 2ij. in the majorana representa-

tion

0 = i2 , 1 = 1 , 2 = 3

and

c0 = 1 , c1 = 3 , c2 = 1,

(2.2)

where the charge conjugation matrix is c = i2 , (i)t = c i c1.

2

the fermionic central charges 3 zia appearing in the p, q commutator (1.2) transform
as spinor-vector under so(2,1),

[zia, njk] = i i[jzk]a 

i
2

zib(jk)b

a .

(2.5)

10d lorentz transformation generators are mmn, and pis transform as vectors and qas
and zias as majorana-weyl spinors.

jacobi identities are satised trivially except one of three qs,

pcyclic [{qa, qb}, qc,] = 0. it requires, using the 10 dimensional cyclic identity,

zjb(j)b

a = 0

(2.6)

which tells zjb is so(2,1) irreducible spin 3/2 generator. with this irreducibility condition
(qa, pim, mmn, zia, nij) form a closed algebra g.

the algebra g is a so(2,1) covariant generalization of ones recently proposed by
sakaguchi [19]. actually if one of fermionic generators zi is eliminated explicitly by using
(2.6) it reproduces algebras in ref.[19].

3 coset construction

in this section we construct invariant forms using the nonlinear realization of the group

g of the algebra g introduced in the last section.

the coset we are going to use is g/h. the numerator is the so(2,1) covariant iib
super-poincare group with the central extension introduced in previous sections. the
subgroup h is product of the homogeneous lorentz group and so(2) which is a subgroup
of so(2,1). we parameterize the coset in the following form

(3.1)

(3.2)

g = gn gz() gp (y) gq(),

gz = eiziaia = eiz
gp = eipim yim = eip y
gq = eiqaa = eiq




the so(2,1)/so(2) part gn is usually parameterized by two scalars, dilaton and axion.
due to the irreducibility condition of zia (2.6) the coordinates ia are not independent
and g is invariant under

3we call zia s central charges in the sense that they (anti-)commute with p, q and z,

i.e. {z, z} = {z, q} = [z, p ] = 0.

ja = (j)a

bb.

(3.3)

the transformation of the coset element g under the group g is

g   g h1,

  g, h  h,

where h is (induced local) subgroup transformation parameterized as

h = e

i

2 mmnmn

ein12.

(3.4)

(3.5)

it determines the transformation of the coset coordinates. under so(2,1) transformations
y0m is a scalar, yim, (i = 1, 2) is so(2) vector doublet 4, a and 0a (a = 1, 2) are so(2)
spinor doublets, ia is so(2) vector-spinor. it is noted that they are not transformed as
so(2,1) multiplets but of so(2) due to the parameterization (3.1).

left invariant one form is constructed as

  ig1dg =

n + qlq + p lp + zlz.

(3.6)

under the transformation of g the m-c form transforms as

  h  h1  ihdh1,

h  h.

(3.7)

n transforms as the so(2) gauge connection while other one forms ls transform ho-

in the last one z is kept multiplying since zs are not independent, (2.6), and there is an
ambiguity in dening lzs.

next we use the m-c one forms (3.8) to obtain bosonic two forms which satisfy two
requirements: one is that the new coordinates yi and ia appear only in exact forms [17].
the other is the invariance under (3.3). from now on we assume constant dilaton and

4in the adjoint representation h represents a rotation of three vectors around the 0 th axis.

(3.15)

bi (i = 1, 2) are pullbacks of the ns-ns and r-r two forms of the at background [6].
ai(i = 1, 2) are corresponding to the dbi world volume u(1) potential and its counterpart
in the r-r sector. in this way the world volume u(1) potentials acquire an interpretation
in terms of coordinates in the extended superspace [19]. f i, ai and bi transform as so(2)
vector doublets under g.

iib sl(2,r) multiplet

next we use the m-c one forms (3.8) to describe the type iib multiplet and examine
their relation to the ns-ns and r-r two forms following sl(2,r) = so(2,1) transforma-
tion rules.

the sl(2,r) representations of the type iib supergravity multiplet are the followings:
the metric and the antisymmetric rank four tensor elds are singlet and the dilaton  and
axion  are coordinates in the nonlinear realization transforming as

 = e(cid:18) 2 + e2 



1(cid:19) ,   t

,   sl(2, r) .

(4.1)

two kinds of second rank antisymmetric tensor elds b = (bn s, br) are sl(2,r) doublet

b  (t)1b .

(4.2)

5

since y0m is a 10d vector coordinate invariant under so(2,1), we identify y0m to the

position coordinate of branes xm and the so(2,1) and susy invariant one forms are

p = dy0m + mc0d = dxm + md  m.
l0m

the induced metric of the branes is

g = mn()m()n,

m = d()m

and is the so(2,1) invariant einstein metric. the m and

la

q = da

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

are susy invariant one forms in the usual space. the latter transforms as a so(2) spinor
doublet under the so(2,1).

in order to nd the relation between the so(2,1) considered above and the type iib
sl(2,r), we examine the transformation rules by using concrete expression of the coset
so(2,1)/so(2). it is convenient to use the sl(2,r) algebra ln

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m , (n, m = 1, 0, 1) .

(4.6)

rather than the so(2,1) algebra nij. they are relating by

l+1 = i(n02 + n12) , l1 = i(n02  n12) , l0 = in01 .

(4.7)

we parameterize the coset element gn  so(2,1)/so(2) also by introducing redundant
so(2) gauge degrees of freedom  [1] as

and it transforms under sl(2,r) = so(2,1) as

gn = el+1el0ein12

gn   gn h1,

  sl(2, r), h  so(2).

(4.8)

(4.9)

the so(2) transformation h is determined up to that of . the 22 matrix representation

(4.10)

these coset coordinates  and  are identied with the ones of the iib supergravity;
dilaton and axion, since the bi-linear so(2) invariant combination of k (4.11) gives  in
(4.1)

kk t = v v t = 

(4.12)

and it transforms in the same manner as (4.1).

this 22 matrix representation k of the so(2,1)/so(2) makes so(2) spinor doublets
to be so(2,1) doublets, e.g. a = k a
bb transforms as   . in order to dene sl(2,r)
doublet two forms ba from so(2) vector doublet bj in (3.15) it is necessary to convert
the vector index of bj to the spinor index. it is possible if there exists an so(2) spinor
 = (sin /2, cos /2). we dene

(4.13)

then the so(2) vector doublet of two forms (3.15) can be lifted to so(2,1) doublet

(4.14)

we can take the so(2) gauge degrees of freedom  satisfying  +  = 0, so that the
so(2,1)/so(2) coset element k (v) takes a conventional form v (, ) expressed in terms
of a dilaton and an axion,

(4.15)

in this section we consider sl(2,r) invariant dp-branes. the action have been dis-
cussed in sl(2,r) covariant forms in [21]. h invariant lagrangians which are constructed
from lq in (4.5), l0
p in (4.3) and f j in (3.13) have the so(2,1) symmetry. as the h
invariant lagrangian we take the lagrangian similar form as that in [21]. for a d1 case,

l =

1

2e (cid:16)det g + f jfj (cid:17)

(5.1)

with f i given (3.13). the dierence is that the u(1) potentials ai are not fundamental
worldvolume elds but given in terms of new superspace coordinates in (5.1). in [19] the
same form of the lagrangian is examined 6 and is shown to have the kappa invariance.
here we clarify the canonical structure and show how the u(1) degrees of freedoms are
incorporated in terms of new superspace coordinates.

6 the sl(2,r) covariant algebra considered in the ref.[19] is not (graded) lie algebra since the structure

constants depend on the dilaton and axion explicitly.

7

in order to discuss it the explicit form of the lagrangian is not necessary we only

assume the lagrangian is described as a h invariant function of form7

l = l(g, f i).

the new variables yi and i enter in the lagrangian only through f i in f i

(5.4)

if the induced metric is not singular the independent equations are

) = 0.

(5.5)

it is the maxwell equation, which would be obtained when ai were independent world
volume elds. it shows that yi, 0 and i are not dynamically independent but have same
dynamical modes of u(1) potentials ai. the u(1) gauge transformation of ai is induced
by that of the new variables, for example,

yim = 2igm

i = 2ig/,

 ai

where i are u(1) gauge parameters.

(5.14)

this is a canonical realization of the irreducibility condition of zia in (2.6), i.e. (5.14) is
the generator of the gauge transformation (3.3). it guarantees the (on-shell) closure of
the so(2,1) covariant super-poincare algebra g.

(5.25)

in the tilde canonical coordinates the extra variables yj and j and their conjugate mo-
menta are decoupled and the set of constraints (5.22)-(5.24) have the same forms as ones
of (5.1) in which the u(1) potentials are regarded as independent elds. comparing with
(5.18) and (5.22), it can be seen that u(1) momenta contribute to h in a same form as
the brane momentum. from the construction there exists the so(2,1) symmetry which
mixes brane coordinates and u(1) modes, i.e. they are coordinates of the enlargespace.
therefore the so(2,1) covariant superalgebra with central extension explain geometrical
origin not only of iib sl(2,r) symmetry but also of world volume u(1) modes.

6 discussions

in this paper we have proposed a so(2,1)=sl(2,r) covariant iib superalgebra with
central extension g. it contains so(2,1) triplet momenta, doublet susy charges and spin
3/2 central charges. in order to describe dp-brane systems the coset, g/( so(2)lorentz
), is considered. our parametrization of the coset naturally leads to the brane coordinates;
a singlet position xm and so(2) doublet fermionic coordinates a. the dilaton and axion
also appear as the coordinates of the coset. the susy invariant two form doublet is
constructed and the u(1) potentials acquire an interpretation in terms of coordinates in
the enlarged space.

the so(2,1)/so(2) coset element gn naturally produce so(2,1) covariant coordinates;
so(2,1) doublet from so(2) doublet and so(2,1) triplet from so(2) triplet. however in
order to obtain the iib sl(2,r) supergravity doublet (bn s, br) from the so(2) vector
doublet the so(2,1)/so(2) coset element k is not sucient. in order to solve this puzzle

we have introduced one more auxiliary eld  in addition to the so(2) gauge parameter
. it gives an alternative representation of the coset so(2,1)/so(2). we showed that in
a gauge  +  = 0 the so(2,1)/so(2) coset element coincides with that of sl(2,r)/so(2)
expressed in terms of the dilaton and the axion. in a similar context, bars looked for the
origin of auxiliary degrees of freedom in the extra space; 14 dimensions [4].

we performed a central extension of iib superalgebras not only in a so(2,1) covariant
manner but it ts with the siegels mechanism [17, 18]. an advantage of the central
extension is that new bosonic coordinates yj and new fermionic coordinates j appear
in supersymmetric combinations to form the simple wess-zumino terms. dynamical
modes of the new coordinates are restricted only on a brane as (5.13) and they play a
role of worldvolume u(1) gauge potentials. therefore the worldvolume u(1) elds can be
recognized as the coordinates of the enlarged superspace. it suggests that the 2 dynamical
modes of the worldvolume u(1) eld of d3-brane can be recognized as coordinates in the
10+2 dimensions [7]. the so(2,1) covariant superalgebra may give us new insight of the
geometrical origin of the iib sl(2,r) duality from higher dimensional view point.
