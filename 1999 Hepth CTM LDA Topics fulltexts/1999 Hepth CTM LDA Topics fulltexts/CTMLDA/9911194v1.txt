introduction

although yang-mills theory and einstein gravity are both based on local symmetries, and include
long-range forces at the classical level, they are very dierent theories. for example, yang-mills
theory is renormalizable, and due to asymptotic freedom, highly nontrivial in the infrared region;
whereas gravity is nonrenormalizable, and its ultraviolet structure is of the greatest interest theoret-
ically. there are also great dierences between the perturbative feynman rules for the two theories:
those for yang-mills theory contain only three- and four-point vertices, while those for gravity can
have arbitrarily many external legs. nevertheless, string theory suggests the heuristic relationship,

gravity  (gauge theory)  (gauge theory) ,

(1)

following from the representation of string amplitudes as integrals over world-sheet variables 
complex integrals for closed strings (gravity) and real integrals for open strings (gauge theory) 
and the factorization of the closed-string integrand into two copies of the open-string integrand.
this relationship was made precise by kawai, lewellen and tye (klt) [1] for tree-level scattering
amplitudes. in this talk we describe the relations between multi-loop scattering amplitudes in gravity
and gauge theory that were obtained in ref. [2], and discuss some of their implications.

multi-loop scattering amplitudes are of considerable interest in both nonabelian gauge theory
and gravity (and their supersymmetric extensions). on the gauge theory side, there are practical
implications for more precise predictions of jet rates and other qcd phenomena observed in collider
experiments. to date, no jet rate computations have been carried out beyond next-to-leading order
in the strong coupling s, even though in many cases, such as e+e annihilation into three jets,
experiment demands one higher order. two-loop scattering amplitudes are required to calculate
such next-to-next-to-leading order corrections.

on the gravity side, ultraviolet properties are of primary interest. although gravity is nonrenor-
malizable by power counting, and the conventional wisdom is that only string theory could possibly
render it nite to all orders, in point of fact no divergence has yet been established for any super-
symmetric theory of gravity in four dimensions. nonsupersymmetric theories of gravity with matter
generically diverge at one loop [3, 4, 5], and pure gravity diverges at two loops [6]. however, super-
symmetry ward identities (swi) [7] forbid all possible one-loop [8] and two-loop [9] counterterms in
any supergravity theory in d = 4. thus at least a three-loop calculation is required to denitively
answer the question of the niteness of four-dimensional supergravity. in addition, there is a can-
didate counterterm at three loops for all supergravities including the maximally extended version
(n = 8) [10]. in ref. [2], divergences were computed in (higher-dimensional) n = 8 supergravity,
but only up to two loops. we expect, though, that the same techniques should be applicable beyond
the two-loop level. in fact, our work suggests a natural conjecture for the divergences appearing at
l loops (see section 4). the conjecture would imply that n = 8 supergravity in d = 4 rst diverges
at ve loops, not three loops.

loop amplitudes in d = 11 supergravity can also be used to extract information about m
theory [11, 12]. here the nite parts of the amplitudes are most important, particularly their
dependence on the radii of one or two compactied dimensions.

1

in principle one could investigate higher-loop relations between gravity and gauge theory in su-
perstring theory using the world-sheet representation. however, at the multi-loop level this becomes
technically rather dicult. also, we would like to study the ultraviolet properties of particle theories
of gravity. recently, the klt relations have been examined at the lagrangian level, by introducing
an auxiliary scalar eld (i.e. the dilaton) into the einstein-hilbert action and carrying out appro-
priate eld redenitions [13]. however, we wont pursue this direction further here. instead we will
use unitarity as a tool. unitarity has proven very useful for one-loop qcd computations [14], and
it has also been applied to two-loop n = 4 super-yang-mills amplitudes [15]. the basic approach
is to calculate the unitarity cuts of an amplitude, and then nd functions that reproduce all such
cuts. one can construct a perturbative bootstrap from tree amplitudes up to multi-loop amplitudes
in this way. in the case of gravity, where the klt relations express its tree amplitudes as roughly
squares of those of gauge theory, unitarity is particularly eective: the same algebraic steps em-
ployed in simplifying the gauge theory cuts can often be recycled in the (otherwise more complex)
corresponding gravity cuts.

2 tree-level relations

the starting point for investigating gravitygauge theory relations via unitarity is the set of tree-
level relations found by klt [1]. the key observation is that any closed string vertex operator is a
product of open string vertex operators,

v closed = v open

left  v

open
right .

(2)

this product structure is then reected in the amplitudes, written as correlation functions of vertex
operators.

for example, the open string tree amplitude for n gluons is

an z dx1    dxn

vabc

y1i<jn

|xi  xj|kikj exp(cid:20)xi<j(cid:16) i  j

(xi  xj)2 +

where

vabc =

dxa dxb dxc

|(xa  xb)(xb  xc)(xc  xa)|

,

ki  j  kj  i

(xi  xj) (cid:17)(cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)lin.

,

(3)

(4)

and xa, xb, xc are any three of the xi. in equation (3) we have suppressed the inverse string tension
, and the lin. denotes that after expanding the exponential one only keeps terms linear in each
polarization vector i. the corresponding closed-string n-graviton amplitude is

mn  z d2z1    d2zn

where

(6)

and za, zb, zc are any three of the zi. in a helicity basis [16], one can write the graviton polarization
tensor as a product of gluon polarization vectors, 

i () = 

i () 

i ().

the closed string integrand in (5) is a product of two open string integrands. this factorization
holds for general closed-string states, not just gravitons, using the tensor product decomposition
of closed string states in terms of open string ones, so that the vertex operator relation (2) can be
applied.

from equations (3) and (5), various contour-integral deformations lead to relations between tree-
level closed and open string amplitudes after all integrations have been performed [1]. here we will
need only the klt relations in the limit   0 for the four- and ve-point amplitudes [17]:

where the mns are the amplitudes in a gravity theory stripped of couplings, the ans are the color-
ordered subamplitudes in a gauge theory and sij  (ki + kj)2. we suppress all j polarizations and
kj momenta, but keep the j labels to distinguish the external legs. the full amplitudes are given
by

where sn/zn is the set of all permutations, but with cyclic rotations removed, g is the gauge theory
coupling constant, and 2 = 32gn . the t ai are fundamental representation matrices for the
yang-mills gauge group su (nc), normalized so that tr(t at b) = ab.

relations (7) and (8) can also be used when each external graviton state in mn is replaced by

any of the 256 states of the n = 8 supergravity multiplet. the fock space decomposition

|n = 8 sugra statei = |n = 4 super ym statei  |n = 4 super ym statei

(10)

should then be used to select the corresponding states for the two an factors on the right-hand side
of the relation.

3 loop amplitudes from unitarity

unitarity of the s matrix, ss = 1, written in terms of the t matrix dened by s  1 + it , reads

2 imtif = xj

t 
ijtjf ,

(11)

where i and f are initial and nal states, and the sum is over intermediate states j (and includes
an integral over intermediate on-shell momenta). perturbative unitarity consists of expanding both

3

sides of equation (11) in terms of coupling constants, g for gauge theory and  for gravity, and
collecting terms of the same order. for example, the imaginary (or absorptive) parts of one-loop
four-point gauge amplitudes (order g4) are given in terms of the product of two four-point tree
amplitudes (g2  g2). the cuts in two-loop four-point gauge amplitudes (order g6) are of two types:
the product of a four-point tree amplitude and a four-point one-loop amplitude (g2  g4), and the
product of two ve-point tree amplitudes (g3  g3). in terms of the number of particles crossing the
cut, the former is a two-particle cut, the latter a three-particle cut.

3.1 two-particle cutting equations

the two-particle cuts in n = 4 super-yang-mills theory have a very simple self-replicating struc-
ture [15]. the key equation is

xs1,s2{n =4}

atree

(1  k1)2 (2  k3)2 atree

4

(1, 2, 3, 4) ,

(12)
where 1,2 are the intermediate momenta, and s1,2 label states of the n = 4 multiplet. the n = 4
labels corresponding to the external states with momenta ki have been suppressed, but equation (12)
is valid for arbitrary combinations of external states. it is also valid for arbitrary (not just four-
dimensional) momenta. one way to derive the equation is by working backwards from the one-loop
n = 4 amplitudes rst obtained using string theory [18].

equation (12) can be represented graphically as

,

(13)

where the blobs represent tree amplitudes, and the two denominator factors in (12) are represented
kinematically by the two internal propagators in the 3 diagram on the far right. this representation
makes clear that the one-loop two-particle cut is given by a cut scalar box integral, multiplied by
the tree amplitude and a simple overall factor. the full one-loop amplitude is obtained simply by
replacing the cut scalar box integral with the full scalar box integral (d is the spacetime dimension),

(14)

3.2 n = 4 iteration

because the dependence of the two-particle cut on the external n = 4 states is just that of the tree
amplitude, the two-particle cuts can be iterated easily. for example, the two-loop two-particle cut

4

is given by

(15)

clearly, the coecients of all multi-loop ladder diagrams can be determined in this way; but so
can the entirely two-particle constructible diagrams, namely those which can be reduced to trees
by successive two-particle cuts, for example

.

(16)

in general, each two-particle cut through a channel with momentum i+j results in an additional

factor of (i + j)2 multiplying the 3 integral [15].

at two loops, all terms in the n = 4 super-yang-mills four-point amplitude are detectable by the
iterated two-particle cuts. in order to conrm that these are the only terms, one must calculate the
more complicated three-particle cuts [15]. beginning at three loops (for nonplanar contributions),
there are terms in the amplitude which do not have any two-particle cuts at all, so three-particle
cuts are required just to guess their form.

the above discussion has been for color-ordered subamplitudes, which need to be dressed with
appropriate color factors to produce the full gauge theory amplitude. for the entirely two-particle
constructible terms, however, this dressing is very simple to describe: in a graphical representation
of the color factors, where a kronecker ab is represented by an internal line and a structure constant
f abc by a three-vertex, one should multiply each kinematic (3) graph by exactly the same color-
factor graph.

5

3.3 recycling gauge theory into gravity

the rst step in repeating the above analysis for n = 8 supergravity is to derive the corresponding
two-particle cutting equation. using the four-point klt relation (7), followed by the yang-mills
cutting equation (12), the appropriate product of two gravity amplitudes is

in the last step we have performed a partial-fractioning of the denominators (using on-shell relations),
in order to get a form which is recognizable as a sum of four dierent cut scalar box integrals,
corresponding to 1  2 and 3  4 permutations of the integral in (14).

equation (17) can be iterated whenever equation (12) can. its structure implies that the coef-
cients of the corresponding 3 integrals in n = 8 supergravity are essentially the squares of those
in n = 4 super-yang-mills theory (once color factors have been removed from the latter) [2]. again
the two-particle cuts should be checked via three- (and higher-) particle cuts. the check for gravity
at two loops is greatly simplied by using the ve-point klt relation (8). the resulting two-loop
n = 8 supergravity amplitude is given by

where +p(2, 3, 4) instructs one to add the ve nontrivial permutations of legs 2, 3, 4.

beyond two loops, complete results are not yet available; a full analysis of higher-particle cuts

must still be performed.

4 ultraviolet divergences in n = 8 supergravity

4.1 two loops

two-loop ultraviolet divergences in n = 8 supergravity can be extracted directly from the two-loop
scattering amplitude (18), by evaluating the divergences of the two 3 double-box integrals that

6

4

appear. since each integral has 7 propagators and 2d loop momenta in the integration measure,
m2-loop
(1, 2, 3, 4) is manifestly nite for d < 7. this behavior is better than what was predicted
by power counting in an n = 4 superspace formalism, which suggested that n = 8 supergravity
should diverge at two loops in d = 5 and 6 [19]. the discrepancy is presumably due to the lack of
a manifest n = 8 invariance in the power-counting argument. in the direct cut-based calculation,
the on-shell n = 8 supersymmetric ward identities are utilized in summing over the intermediate
states crossing the cuts.

for d  7, no cancellations occur, and there are divergences in every dimension of interest. the

results are [2],

and s = s12, t = s23, u = s13. we omit the d = 8 two-loop divergence because the d = 8
theory diverges already at one loop, as can be seen easily by inspecting the box integral (14). new
counterterms appear at two loops, though, as one would expect from a nonrenormalizable theory.
(there are no corresponding one-loop divergences in d = 9 or d = 11, in dimensional regularization,
because all invariants have even dimension. in d = 10, there is a cancellation of one-loop divergences
between the three dierent box integrals, because s + t + u = 0.)

the presence of a factor of stu m tree

in equation (19) implies that in all the above cases, for
four graviton external states, the linearized counterterms take the form of derivatives acting on the
operator

where the tensor t8 is dened in equation (9.a.18) of ref. [20], plus the appropriate n = 8 completion.
when the indices are restricted to four dimensions, t8t8r4 becomes equal to the bel-robinson
tensor [21]. we note that the operator (21) appears in the tree-level superstring eective action [22].
it also appears as the one-loop counterterm for n = 8 supergravity in d = 8. finally, by calculating
the same amplitude in compactied supergravity, it can be argued that it appears in the m theory
eective action at one loop [11], and with the above set of derivatives at two loops [12].

the result (20) shows that even d = 11 supergravity diverges. the manifest d-independence
of the cutting algebra allowed us to extend the calculation to d = 11, even though there is no
corresponding d = 11 super-yang-mills theory. although we have established a divergence, we
have not given a full description of the multiplet of counterterms, in particular how it depends on
the three-form potential a. further work on the structure of the d = 11 counterterm has been
carried out in ref. [23].

7

4.2 beyond two loops (a conjecture)

although we have not performed a full calculation beyond two loops in either n = 4 super-yang-
mills theory or n = 8 supergravity, the structure of the entirely two-particle constructible terms
leads to a natural conjecture for where divergences appear at l loops. in the yang-mills case, for
each additional loop the maximum number of powers of loop momentum in the numerator increases
by two, corresponding to the insertion of (i + j)2 mentioned in section 3.2. thus, for l > 1 loops
we expect that the most divergent integrals have 2l  4 powers of loop momenta in the numerator.
there are also three additional scalar propagators per loop. the integrals scale as

z (ddp)l (p2)(l2)
(p2)3l+1 .

(the l = 1 case is special and must be treated separately.) these integrals are nite for

d <

6
l

+ 4 ,

(l > 1) .

(22)

(23)

the result (23) diers from expectations based on n = 2 superspace power-counting [24]. specif-
ically, for dimensions d = 5, 6 and 7 the amplitudes rst diverge at l = 6, 3 and 2 loops. the
corresponding superspace arguments indicate that the rst divergence may occur at l = 4, 3 and 2,
respectively. although (23) is still only a conjecture, it is consistent with three-loop contributions
that are not detectable by the two-particle cuts, and for which we have evaluated the three-particle
cuts. more generally, it is also consistent with a subset of the n-particle cuts where so-called max-
imally helicity-violating tree amplitudes appear on each side of the cut [2]. we suspect that the
dierence with ref. [24] is due to a lack of full manifest supersymmetry in the power-counting argu-
ment.

for n = 8 supergravity, from insertions of [(i + j)2]2 factors in the two-particle cuts, we expect

the scaling of the most divergent integrals at l loops to be

z (ddp)l (p2)2(l2)
(p2)3l+1 .

this leads to a conjectured niteness condition,

d <

10
l

+ 2 ,

(l > 1) .

(24)

(25)

in particular, we expect no three-loop divergence to appear in d = 4  contrary to expectations
from an n = 4 superspace analysis [19, 24]. we expect the rst r4-type counterterm to occur at ve
loops instead. the divergence should have the same kinematical structure as the d = 7 divergence
in (19), but with a dierent non-vanishing numerical coecient.

ref. [12] argues that the coecients of operators with exactly four derivatives acting on t8t8r4
in the m theory eective action are completely accounted for by the two-loop amplitudes. however,
the scaling behavior in (24), inferred from the two-particle cuts, suggests nonvanishing contributions
of this type from all l > 2. a full three-loop supergravity calculation would be very welcome, to
address both the expected niteness in d = 4, and whether there are 4t8t8r4 contributions.

5 conclusions

the heuristic relation (1) between gravity and gauge theory is a very useful way to think about
gravity, at least perturbatively. unitarity allows one to bootstrap the tree-level (klt) versions
of (1) up to the multi-loop level. thus gravity calculations can be performed by recycling the simpler
yang-mills calculations. although we have discussed primarily the maximally supersymmetric case,
where explicit calculations are the simplest, there should be applications to more general cases as
well. indeed, special one-loop helicity amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of external gravitons have
been computed in this way, in both n = 8 supergravity and pure gravity [25].

we have learned that supergravity amplitudes are less divergent than previously expected. in
d = 4, it is still true that no supergravity divergence has yet been rmly established. indeed, our
expectations in the maximally supersymmetric case, n = 8, are for the rst divergence to occur
only at ve loops, not three loops. further work in this direction, using the techniques described
here, could help to remedy this situation.
