1 introduction

lightcone(lc) dominated hard scattering processes, like deep inelastic scattering
and deeply virtual compton scattering, and various hadronic wave functions, e.g., vec-
tor meson amplitudes, appearing in (semi) exclusive processes are most eectively de-
scribed by the help of the nonlocal lightcone expansion [1].thereby, the same nonlocal
lcoperator, and its anomalous dimension, is related to dierent phenomenological
distribution amplitudes, and their q2evolution kernels [2]. growing experimental
precision requires the consideration of higher twist contributions. therefore, it is
necessary to decompose the nonlocal lcoperators according to their twist content.
unfortunately, geometric twist ( ) = dimension (d) spin (j), introduced for the
local lcoperators [3] cannot be extended directly to nonlocal lcoperators. there-
fore, motivated by lcquantization and by kinematic phenomenology the notion of
dynamic twist (t) was introduced counting powers q2t of the momentum trans-
fer [4]. however, this notion is dened only for matrix elements of operators, is not
lorentz invariant and its relation to geometric twist is complicated, cf. [5].

here, we carry on a systematic procedure to uniquely decompose nonlocal lc
operators into harmonic operators of well dened geometric twist, cf. ref. [6]. this
will be demonstrated for tensor operators of low rank, namely (pseudo)scalars, (axial)
vectors and (skew)symmetric tensors thereby, various harmonic tensor operators (in
d = 2h space-time dimensions) are introduced being related to specic innite series
of symmetry classes which are dened by corresponding young tableaus.
in the
scalar case these lcoperators are series of the well-known harmonic polynomials

corresponding to (symmetric) tensor representations of the orthogonal group so(d),
cf. [7]. symmetric tensor operators of rank 2 are considered as an example.

2 general procedure

(1x)u(1 x, 2 x)ef(2x) :, where (x), f(x) and ef(x) are the quark eld,

let us generically denote by o(1x, 2x) with x2 = 0 any of the following bilocal
light-ray operators, either the quark operators : (1 x)u(1 x, 2x)(2 x) : with
(1x)u(1 x, 2 x)f(2 x) : and
 = {1, , , 5, 5} or the gluon operators : f
: f
the gluon eld strength and its dual, respectively, and the path ordered phase factor is
d xa(x)} with the gauge potential a(x).
the general procedure of decomposing these operators into operators of denite twist
consists of the following steps:
(1) expansion of the nonlocal operators for arbitrary values of x into a taylor series
of local tensor operators having denite rank n and canonical dimension d:

given by u(1x, 2x) = p exp{igr 1

n=0(n!)1x1 . . . xno 1...n(1, 2);

o(1x, 2x) =p

the local operators are dened by (the brackets (. . . ) denote total symmetrization)

with generalized covariant derivatives d(1, 2)  1(
(2) decomposition of the local operators (2) into tensors being irreducible under the
(orthochronous) lorentz group, i.e. having twist  = dj. these are traceless tensors
being classied according to their symmetry class. the latter is determined by a
(normalized) young-operator y[m] = f[m]qp/n!, where [m] = (m1  m2  . . .  mr)
i=1 mi = n denes a young pattern, and p and q denote symmetrizations
and antisymmetrizations w.r.to the horizontal and vertical permutations of a standard
tableau, respectively; f[m] is the number of standard tableaus to [m].

with pr

this decomposition can be done for any dimension d = 2h of the complex
orthogonal group so(2h, c). then, the allowed young patterns are restricted by
1 + 2  2h (i: length of columns of [m]). since the operators (2) are totally sym-
metric w.r.t. is only the following symmetry types, depending on the additional
tensor structure , are of relevance (lower spins j are related to trace terms):

(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

[m] = (n)
[m] = (n, 1)
[m] = (n, 1, 1)
[m] = (n, 2)

j = n, n  2, n  4, ..., f(n)
= 1,
j = n, n  1, n  2, ..., f(n,1) = n,
j = n, n  1, n  2, ..., f(n,1,1) = n(n + 1)/2,
j = n, n  1, n  2, ..., f(n,2) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2.

if multiplied by x1 . . . xn according to eq. (1) these representations may be charac-
terized by harmonic tensor polynomials of order n, cf. sect. 3 below.
(3) resummation of the innite series (for any n) of irreducible tensor harmonics of
equal twist  and symmetry type y[m] to nonlocal harmonic operators of denite twist.
thereby, the phase factors may be reconstructed on the expense of (two) additional
integrations over parameters multiplying the variables. as a result one obtains a

decomposition of the original nonlinear operator into a series of operators with grow-
ing twist, each being dened by subtracting appropriate traces, cf. sect. 4 below.

(4) projection onto the lightcone, x  x = x + (x)(cid:0)p1  x2/(x)2  1(cid:1), 2 = 1,

leads to the required twist decomposition:

o(1 x, 2 x) = pmax

i=min oi

 (1 x, 2x).

(3)

this sum terminates since most of the traces are proportional to x2 and, therefore,
vanish on the lightcone.
let us remark that step (3) and (4) may be interchanged without changing the result.
in fact, this corresponds to another formalism acting on the complex lightcone [7]
being used for the construction of conformal tensors by dobrev and ganchev [8].

3 harmonic tensor polynomials

the construction of irreducible tensors may start with traceless tensors
t (1...n),
with  indicating additional tensor indices, which afterwards have to be subjected
to the symmetry requirements determined by the symmetry classes (i)  (iv). let
us start with a generic tensor, not being traceless, whose symmetrized indices are
contracted by xis: tn(x) = x1 . . . xnt(1...n). the conditions for scalar, (axial)
vector resp. (skew)symmetric tensors to be traceless read:





(cid:3)

t  n(x) = 0,







t  n(x) = 0 resp. 


and g
the general solutions of these equations in d = 2h dimensions are:
(1) scalar harmonic polynomials (cf. [9]):

t  n(x) = 0 = 

t  n(x)

t  n(x) = 0. (5)

where, up to the common factor [(h  1)(h + n)(h + n  1)(2h + n  2)(2h + n  3)]1,
the coecients are given by
an = (h + n  1)(h + n  2)(2h + n  3),
cn = [h(h + n  1)  n + 2](2h + n  3),
en = [h(h + n  2)  n + 3](h + n  2),
gn = [h(h + n  1)  n + 1](h + n  2)(2h + n  3),
kn = [h(h + n  3)  2n + 3] + (h + n)(h + n  1)/2.
these coecients look quite complicated. however, in d = 4 dimensions they sim-
plify considerably. the extension to tensors of higher rank is obvious, but cumber-
some. up to now no simple building principle has been found, and a general theory,
to the best of our knowledge, does not exist.

bn = (h + n  2)(2h + n  3),
dn = [h(h + n  4)  2(n  3)],
fn = (2h + n  3),
hn = (h  3)

4 twist decomposition: an example

besides the scalar case these harmonic tensor polynomials are not irreducible with
respect to so(2h, c). irreducible polynomials are obtained by (anti)symmetrization
according to the young patterns (i)  (iv); this may be achieved by acting on it with
corresponding dierential operators, multiplied by the weights f[m]. afterwards, in
order to get the (local) operators on the lightcone, one takes the limit x  x. the
nonlocal lcoperators are obtained by resummation according to eq. (1).

for the quark operators that procedure has been already considered in [6]. here
we shall consider the gluon operators being tensors of rank 2. the relevant young
patterns are given by (i)  (iv). of course, in physical applications they appear
sometimes also multiplied with x or/and x; then higher patterns are irrelevant.

let us consider totally symmetric tensors leading to much simpler symmetric

harmonic tensor polynomials then those given by the general expression (9):

t (i)
()n(x) =

t n+2(x) =

(n+2)(n+1)

4kk!(h+n)! nx2k
+ 2kx2(k1)(cid:0)g + 2x()(cid:1) + 4k(k  1)xxx2(k2)o(cid:3)ktn+2(x).

(n+2)(n+1)xk=0

(1)k(h+nk)!

(10)

related to the number of partial derivatives this sum contains symmetric tensor,
vector and scalar polynomials of lower degree. of course, if projected onto the light-
cone only those terms survive which do not depend on x2. they are given by

t (i)
()n(x) =

(n+2)(n+1)(h+n)(h+n1)ddtn+2(x),

(11)

with the interior derivative d = [(h  1 + x)  1
(cf. ref. [7]); because of d2 = 0 the conditions of tracelessness on the light-cone,
dt (i)

()n(x) = 0 = dt (i)
the local gluon operator having twist  = 2h  2 is obtained from the original
(n+2)(n+1) gn+2(x) by subtracting the traces being of twist 2h

2x(cid:3)](cid:12)(cid:12)x=x on the light-cone

()n(x) = 0, are trivially fullled.

for the nonlocal gluon operator g()(1 x, 2 x) = f 

((1 x)u(1 x, 2x)f)(2 x)
the expressions (11) may be resummed leading, if restricted to d = 4, to the following
one-parameter integral representation (g(1 x, 2x)  xxg()(1 x, 2 x)):

() (1x, 2 x) =z 1

.

(16)

analogous expressions result for (12)  (15). this completes the twist decomposition
of g(i)
()(1x, 2x). the decomposition of g(1x, 2x) w.r.to the other symmetry
classes is much more complicated. a complete presentation will be given elsewhere.
