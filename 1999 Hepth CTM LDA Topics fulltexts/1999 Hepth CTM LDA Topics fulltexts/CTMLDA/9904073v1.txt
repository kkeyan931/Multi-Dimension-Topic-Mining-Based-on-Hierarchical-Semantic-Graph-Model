abstract: we study the duality between string theory on ads3  s3  s3 and two-
dimensional conformal theories with large n = 4 superconformal algebra a. we discuss
congurations of intersecting branes which give rise to such near-horizon geometries. we
compute the kaluza-klein spectrum and propose that the boundary superconformal the-

introduction

among the ads/cft dualities [13] the case of ads3/cf t2 is distiguished because
generically one has better control of both sides of the correspondence. on the one side,
one deals with 2d superconformal eld theories (scft) which have been quite extensively
studied. on the other side, one has a three-dimensional ads gravity which is quite simple
by itself. in addition, the near-horizon limit generically involves (after suitable dualities)
exact wzw models for the various parts that make up the near-horizon conguration,
so one can go beyond the supergravity approximation by considering string theory on
ads3[46].

it is thus quite natural to try to fully explore these cases and hopefully learn some
lessons for the higher dimensional cases as well. to that end one can try to formulate the
correspondence in a setting such that there is as much control over the theory as possible.
this can happen either if we are dealing with a theory with very little structure, like a free
fermion, or with a theory with a large symmetry group. in this paper we will follow the
second route. we will study the correspondence in the case the boundary superconformal
theory has the maximal possible linearly realized symmetry, i.e. the symmetry algebra
is the large (or double) n = 4 superconformal algebra a [7, 8]. this algebra contains
two commuting ane dsu(2) lie algebras (in contrast, the small n = 4 algebra contains
only one ane dsu(2) lie algebra). it also contains the nite dimensional superalgebra
d1(2, 1, /(1  )). conformal models with this symmetry algebra are characterized by
two integers, the two levels k+ and k of the two ane dsu(2) algebras ( = k/(k++k)).

one might expect that these models would be easy to analyze because of the large
amount of symmetry. however, this turns out not to be the case as the structure of the
superconformal algebra is quite non-trivial. in supersymmetric theories the analysis of
bps sector of the theory is usually tractable. for instance, in theories with the n = 2
or the small n = 4 symmetry algebra there is a linear relation between the conformal
dimension and charge of a bps state. this implies that the bps states form a ring.
in the case of a there is still a bogomolnyi bound. the relation, however, between
the conformal weight and the charges is non-linear. this complicates the analysis.
in
particular, for the brane realization that we will study the non-linear piece is subleading
in 1/n 4 and therefore corresponds to string loop corrections. thus, we nd the novel
situation that the mass formula for bps states receives quantum corrections. this leads
4n can stand for k  k+ + k, k+/k or k/k+. in the large n limit the number of branes of certain
types always becomes large. when we talk about 1/n corrections in later sections it will be clear from
the context what is meant by n .

2

to the possibility that states that satisfy a bound in supergravity cease to do so in string
theory. in addition, bps states do not form a ring (but they may form a module over a
ring).

ads/cft dual pairs can be obtained by considering a conguration of branes and
taking a limit in which a decoupled worldvolume theory is obtained. this limit is at the
same time a near-horizon limit for the corresponding supergravity conguration. the
near-horizon isometry superalgebra becomes the worldvolume superconformal algebra. a
brane conguration that leads to a dual superconformal theory with symmetry algebra
a was identied in [9]. it consists of a non-standard intersection of two m5 branes
with an m2 brane. in the near-horizon limit the geometry contains ads3  s3  s3. the
isometry groups of the two spheres become the r-symmetry su(2)s, and the radii of the
spheres are related to the levels of the dsu(2)s. brane congurations with the same near-

horizon limit exist in all string theories. in particular, in iib string theory a conguration
that leads to this geometry consists of an overlap of two d1-d5 systems (similarly the
m-theory conguration may be thought of as an overlap of two m2-m5 systems). the
near-horizon limit in the case of m-branes is the standard low-energy limit. in the case
of iib branes, however, one needs to consider an ultra-low energy limit.

another motivation for studying this system is that it can be viewed as the master
conguration from which one can reach other systems involving in their near-horizon
limit a factor of ads2 or ads3 and one or two factors of s2 and/or s3 by either adding
branes and/or taking appropriate limits [9]. therefore, a complete understanding of the
ads3  s3  s3 conguration may lead to a unied picture of all the other cases as well.
in this paper we begin a detailed analysis of the ads3  s3  s3/a duality. previous
work can be found in [10]. one of our aims is to identify the dual superconformal theory.
we will propose, generalizing the proposal of [10, 11], that the dual scft is a sigma model
with target space the symmetric product symk
(u(2)), with k/k units of h = db ux
and certain discrete gauge elds associated to the permutation group sk turned on.
the latter are needed to make the conformal eld theory well-dened. an alternative
description is obtained by exchanging the roles of k+ and k.

we start our analysis by studying the supergravity solutions. the rst problem one
encounters is that the near-horizon geometry contains an extra non-compact isometry.
in order to be able to reduce the theory to three dimensions we need to compactify
this direction. the corresponding identications induce a novel uv/ir relation between
the worldvolume theories of the two overlapping brane congurations. furthermore, the
requirement that the brown-henneaux central charge [12] matches the central charge of

3

the a theory xes the product of the radius of the extra circle and the string coupling
constant. the ratio of the two is a modulus of the solution. for xed string coupling
constant, the radius can be made very small at large n.

to obtain some information about the spectrum of the conformal eld theory we
compute the kaluza-klein (kk) spectrum of supergravity on ads3  s3  s3  s1. since
the radius of s1 can be made very small in the large n limit we start from 9d supergravity.
the kk spectrum is obtained by using the group theory method developed in [13, 14].
the rather tedious computation yields a quite simple spectrum. the kk states t in short
multiplets of d1(2, 1, ), but many short multiplets can be combined into long multiplets
and we get only limited information about the set of bps states at a generic point in the
moduli space.

having obtained the single particle kk spectrum the next step is to obtain the chiral
spectrum of the dual conformal eld theory. the main question is which of the single and
multiparticle states correspond to chiral states of the boundary scft. because of the non-
linearity of the bps bound this is a dicult question, especially since the non-linearity is
invisible in supergravity. we will consider various possible answers to this question and
discuss which ones are consistent with the above mentioned proposal for a candidate
boundary scft. notice that to verify directly which of the single and multiparticle
states are actually massive we would need to calculate 1/n corrections as the bps bound
contains terms subleading in 1/n.

another way to obtain information about the boundary superconformal theory is to
use d-brane perturbation theory. the boundary theory is then the infrared limit of the
worldvolume gauge theory. this is expected to be (a deformation of) a sigma model with
target space the moduli space of vacua of the worldvolume gauge theory. one may study
the d-brane system by introducing a probe brane. a new feature in our case is that
the theory on the probe contains new couplings due to loops of open strings that cannot
be ignored even at low-energies since they involve massless particles. these couplings,
however, are subleading in 1/n. thus, only in the large n limit one expects that the a
theory can be described by a perturbative sigma model. indeed, we nd that 1/n is what
controls the loop expansion of the sigma models with a symmetry.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we present the relevant supergravity
solutions, both in m-theory and in type iib. the main properties of the large n = 4
superconformal algebra a as well as the closely related non-linear algebra a are recalled
in section 3. section 4 contains the computation of the kaluza-klein spectrum. in section
5 we discuss the multiparticle spectrum and we present our proposal for the boundary

4

scft. section 6 contains some remarks on the the d-brane analysis of the system, and
section 7 a discussion of -models with a symmetry. open problems are discussed in
section 8. in the appendix we present our conventions.

2 solitonic description

in this section we review supergravity solutions which in the near-horizon limit yield
a solution of the form ads3 s3 s3 s1. supergravities in 10 dimensions (i.e. type iia,
type iib and type i) as well as 11d supergravity have solutions describing intersecting
branes that in an appropriate limit approach a geometry that contains ads3  s3  s3.5
the type iia solution can be obtained from the m-theory solution by reduction. the
type i solution can be obtained from either the iia or the iib solution. the m-theory
and iib solution seem not to be related by dualities (at least in an obvious manner) so
we will discuss them separately.

before presenting the solutions we briey discuss their connection to solutions involv-
ing a factor of ads2 and/or s2s in the near-horizon limit. there is a simple way, the
wave/monopole rule[9], to generate solutions that contain a factor of ads2 and/or s2 in
their near-horizon limit starting from a solution that contains ads3 and/or s3. to get a
factor of ads2 one has to add a wave to the solution, after which one has to t-dualize
it (or reduce it if we start from eleven dimensions) in the direction of the wave. to get
a solution that involves an s2 one has to add a kk monopole, after which one has to
t-dualize (or reduce) in the nut-direction.6 in addition, the wave/monopole rule allows
one to determine the isometry superalgebra of the new solution (since one can obtain
both the killing spinors and the bosonic isometries starting from the killing spinors and
the bosonic isometries of the solution that involves ads3 and/or s3), and therefore the
symmetry algebra of the dual superconformal theory. all solutions found in this way
involve exact cfts in their near-horizon limit. (actually one can trace the origin of the
wave/monopole rule to the relation between the exact cfts associated to ads3, ads2
and s3, s2). details can be found in [9]. the solutions can be further generalized to
include rotation [18]. this does not change the near-horizon conguration as the eect of
the rotation can be removed by a coordinate transformation. further solutions with the

5a solution of this form appeared rst in the context of the heterotic string theory in [15], and as a

near-horizon limit of a conguration of intersecting branes in type i supergravity in [16].

6notice that the near-horizon limit of the nal conguration is a very-near-horizon limit[17] of
the original one. this is so because the t-duality that connects the two conguration involves explicit
factors of .

same near-horizon geometry can be found in [19].

corresponding unit spheres. the eld strengths are covariantly constant. one can check
that the explicit factors of lp in the solution cancel against the factors of lp in newtons
constant, so we set lp = 1 from now on.

let us briey recall the analysis of supersymmetry from [9]. one can easily check that
the solution (2.1) preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetries. in the near-horizon limit this
is enhanced by a factor of 2. the killing spinors are products of the geometric killing
spinors on ads3 and the three-spheres as we now discuss. to analyze the supersymmetry
it is most convenient to choose a basis for the dirac matrices that is adapted to the
geometry of the space. such basis is given in (18) of [9]. the 11d spinors  are also
decomposed correspondingly:  =         , where  is a spinor on ads3,  and
 are spinors on the two s3s,  is a spinor on the two-dimensional space spanned by x2
and , and  is an extra two-component spinor. all spinors are two-component ones, so
we get that  has 32 components as it should. we refer to [9] for details, here we only

7

give the nal solution. the killing spinor equations are satised if , ,  are geometric
killing spinors on ads3 and the two s3s:

where 2,  are gamma matrices in the euclidean x2,  space, and 1, 3 are pauli ma-
trices. one can check that  is traceless and 2 = 1, so the projection breaks 1/2 of
the supersymmetry. in (2.11) the signs are correlated, namely the 11d killing spinor is
either a product of killing spinors that solve the equations (2.11) with the plus sign or
the ones that solve the equations with the minus sign. equations (2.11) have maximal
number of solutions. therefore, the near-horizon solution preserves 16 supercharges. the
form of the killing spinors plus the bosonic symmetries already imply that the isometry
superalgebra is d1(2, 1, ). this has been explicitly veried in [18] by constructing the
isometry superalgebra from the killing spinors.

from the m-theory solution (2.1) we can obtain a solution of iia supergravity describ-
ing an intersection of two solitonic vebranes over a fundamental string upon reduction
over x2. its near-horizon limit can be obtained from (2.9):

7we use the convention to leave a factor of g2

eld vanishes asymptotically. s-duality acts as gs  1/gs,   gs, and t-duality as r  /r, gs 
gs/r, see [23] for details.

8notice that n (i)

t , i = 1, 2 are the membrane densities in eleven dimensional planck units. since

8

notice that the values of the elds in (2.13) are the canonical ones such that there
are exact cfts associated with each factor, namely an sl(2, r) wzw model for the
ads3 part and two su(2) wzw models at level n (1)
f , respectively, for the two
s3s. this implies a quantization condition for n (i)
f , i = 1, 2. in the original solution this
quantization was due to a quantization of the magnetic uxes over the two s3s.

the metric in (2.21) is of the form ads3  s3  s3  r. the ads3 radius is equal to l

to compactify the  coordinate, but leave the rest of the conguration intact. a similar

systems. at this stage the parameter l seems a free parameter. however, its value is xed
to a specic value in order to get the correct central charge for the boundary conformal
eld theory.

proportional to the square of the radius of that space; this can be seen either via kk
reduction or directly in string theory.
in particular, the level k of the su(2) current
algebra associated to a three-sphere of radius r is given by

3 the a and a scft

in this section we review the n = 4 double scfts and discuss some of their proper-
ties. the n = 4 double scfts are based on the one-parameter family of n = 4 super
conformal algebras (sca) a. these algebras contain, among other sub-structures, two
commuting dsu(2) ane lie algebras and a nite sub-superalgebra d(2, 1, /(1  )),
where  r. they are parametrized by the central charge of the virasoro algebra c and
the parameter  or equivalently by the levels k+ and k of dsu(2)
. the

and dsu(2)

parameters are related by

+



c =

6k+k

k

with k  k+ + k =

c

6(1  )

(3.1)

besides the virasoro generators, the algebra is generated by the two sets of dsu(2)
generators ai, a du(1) generator u, all with dimensions 1; four supersymmetry generators

ga with dimensions 3/2 and four fermionic generators qa with dimensions 1/2. the
operator product expansions of these elds are given in appendix a.



we are interested in the unitary representations of this algebra [2527], where k+ and
k are positive integers, and in particular in the primary states in the neveu-schwarz
(ns) sector. we thus consider the unitary highest weight states |hwsi dened by 9

(l)n|hwsi = (ai)n|hwsi = (u)n|hwsi = (a+)0|hwsi = 0 for n = 1, 2, . . . , i = 1, 2, 3

thus each hws is characterized by its conformal dimension h, u(1) charge u, and the
spins l under the two su(2)s. the unitarity of the representation implies that

in supersymmetric conformal eld theories based on the n = 2 or small n = 4 algebra,
the states which saturate some bound for the conformal dimension, are in short multiplets
and form a ring, called chiral ring. indeed also for the double n = 4 algebras the hws
for which kh = (l+  l)2 + kl+ + k+l + u2 satisfy the chirality (or massless) condition
(3.4)
9by convention, the su (2) indices i, j run over 1, 2, 3 or +,, 3, and the indices a, b over 1, 2, 3, 4 or

where g is dened in eq. (3.5). it is important to notice that in the case of the a algebra,
the chiral states do not form any obvious ring, due to the quadratic dependence on the
u(1) charge and the su(2) spins. we will come back to this issue after having introduced
the a algebra.

the a algebra is related [28] to another sca called a, or non-linear a, with no
dimension 1/2 generators, but composite operators in the operator product expansion
(ope). we will denote all operators belonging to this algebra by a tilde. indeed, starting
from the a algebra, if one introduces the operators 10

one can show that the u and q operators decouple completely from the others and form
a free algebra. the other operators form a sca with central charge c = c 3 with respect
to which g and a are primary operators with dimension 3/2 and 1 respectively. the a
are dsu(2)

ane lie algebra generators with levels



(3.6)

the unitary hws representations of the two algebras are in one-to-one correspondence.
indeed to each representation of a with h, l, u there corresponds a representation of a
with

,

(3.7)
inversely, to each representation of a there corresponds an innite set of representa-
tions of a built by adding one free boson and four free fermions and choosing some u
compatible with the radius of the du(1) generator u.
to compare with the spectrum that we obtain from the supergravity analysis, we are
interested in the explicit form of the chiral multiplets in the a algebra. the hws states
are now dened by

( l)n|hwsi = ( ai)n|hwsi = ( a+)0|hwsi = 0 for n = 1, 2, . . . , i = 1, 2, 3

the chiral condition is again given by eq. (3.4). the conformal dimension of a chiral
state is now

khc = (l+  l)2 + kl+ + k+l

(3.9)

the explicit form of the chiral multiplet is the same as the one of the d1(2, 1, ) given in
(4.1)-(4.3). as in the case of the linear algebra, these states do not form a ring. however,
since

khc(l+, l) + khc(m+, m) = khc(l+ + m+, l + m)  2(l+  l)(m+  m)

(3.10)

if either l+ = l or m+ = m, the ope of the two chiral operators corresponding to
these states contains no singular terms and the products of these two operators can give
rise to another chiral operator. this shows that in contrast to the case of the usual
n = 2 or n = 4 algebra, the chiral operators do not form a ring but they could form a
module over a ring. the latter ring is generated by all chiral elds of the form l+ = l.

we conclude this section by discussing some general constraints on the spectrum of
chiral operators in any a theory that were derived in [29]. let nl,l be the number
of chiral operators with left- and right-moving su(2) quantum numbers (l+, l; l+, l).
consider the generating function

f (p, q, r, s) = xl,l

nl,lp2l+

q2l

r2l+

s2l

(3.11)

according to [29] certain linear combinations of the multiplicities nl,l should give rise to
su(2) modular invariants. these linear combinations are contained in another generating
function dened by

g(x, y) =

(k++k)/2xl,l=0

x2ly2l

k/2xl,l=0

(1)2l+2l

it is easy to see that

k+2l+2l,2lk+2l+2l,2lnl,l

g(x, y) 

(k++k)/2xl,l=0

x2ly2lnl,l = (xy)k

f (x,x1, y,y1).

(3.13)

the numbers nl,l should correspond to a modular invariant of su(2). for example, the
diagonal modular invariant appears when the function f satises

4 kaluza-klein spectrum

to compute the kaluza-klein spectrum of 10d supergravity on ads3  s3  s3  s1
we use representation theory and follow the method explained in [14]. in other words,
we will only compute the quantum numbers of the kk modes under the so(4)  so(4)
isometry group of s3  s3, and deduce the conformal weights of the kk states from that.
in the large k limit (and with gs xed) the radius of s1 is small so we start from nine
dimensional supergravity.

the rst step in this procedure is to determine the relevant ads supergroup, which is a
symmetry of nine-dimensional supergravity on ads3s3s3. kk modes have to fall into
multiplets of this ads supergroup. as we discussed in section 2, in the case at hand the
relevant supergroup is d1(2, 1, )  d1(2, 1, )11 [9]. indeed, in general the chiral algebra
of the boundary cft is the hamiltonian reduction of the ane lie superalgebra made
from the ads supergroup, and the a sca can be obtained via hamiltonian reduction
from dd1(2, 1, ) [30]. also notice that the bosonic subalgebra of d1(2, 1, )  d1(2, 1, )
is su(2)4  sl(2, r)2, which is the isometry group of ads3  s3  s3.

1/2, ai

the next step is to study the representations of d1(2, 1, ). we can think of d1(2, 1, )
as being generated by the generators l1, l0, ga
0 of the a algebra. the represen-
tation theory of d1(2, 1, ) mirrors that of a. there are long and short representations.
representations are labeled by the su(2) quantum numbers l and the conformal weight
h, and will be denoted by (l+, l, h). unitarity implies the bound h  l + (1  )l+.
when this bound is saturated the corresponding representation is a short representation,
which will be denoted by (l+, l)s. each d1(2, 1, ) representation can be decomposed
in terms of representations of the su(2)  su(2) subgroup whose representations will be
labeled by (j, j). generic short representations contain 8 su(2) su(2) representations,
namely

(4.3)

the kk spectrum can now be determined as in [14]. we start with nine-dimensional
supergravity, determine using representation theory the su(2)4 quantum numbers of all
kk states, and organize those quantum numbers in terms of short representations of
d1(2, 1, )  d1(2, 1, ). short representations of d1(2, 1, )  d1(2, 1, ) are simply the
tensor product of two short representations (l+, l)s and (l+, l)s, and will be denoted
by (l+, l; l+, l)s. each of these contains 64 su(2)4 representations, and it is a non-
trivial check on the correctness of the set of su(2)4 quantum numbers of the kk states
to see if they organize in appropriate groups of 64. once we organize the kk states in
short representations we also know their conformal weights. the reason that we expect
only short representations to appear in the kk spectrum is that all kk elds originated
from massless elds in nine-dimensions. thus, they saturate the inequality m2  0 and
it is natural to identify this with the bound on the conformal weight of a d1(2, 1, )
representation.

we omit the details of the calculation, but it turns out that the kk spectrum can
indeed be organized in terms of short representations and the nal result for the kk
spectrum reads

algebra, in particular the stress-energy tensor of the boundary theory. they arise via a
suitable supersymmetric generalization of [12].

5 multiparticle spectrum and boundary scft

in the previous section we determined the kk spectrum of single particle states in
supergravity, see (4.4). we organized the spectrum in terms of short representations of
d1(2, 1, )  d1(2, 1, ). the rst issue we want to address in this section is which of
the single and multiparticle states correspond to chiral operators of the boundary scft.
because of the nonlinearity of the bound (3.9) this is a rather dicult question, especially
since the nonlinear part of (3.9) is invisible in supergravity where k are very large. a
priori there are at least four options:
(i) all multiparticle states correspond to chiral operators of the boundary scft.
(ii) only products of one single particle state with arbitrary many states of the form
(l, l; l, l)s are massless; this is inspired by equation (3.10) and the discussion below it, in
which we argued the most natural structure on the space of chiral operators is that of a
module over a ring.
(iii) only the single particle states correspond to chiral operators of the boundary scft.
(iv) except for powers of the representations (0, 0; 1
2 )s,
there are no multiparticle states corresponding to chiral operators. the motivation for
this is that long representations of d1(2, 1, ), as far as their su(2)  su(2) quantum
numbers go, contain two short d1(2, 1, ) representations

from this we see that the entire kk spectrum (4.4) can be written as the sum of
(0, 0; 1
2)s, and (long)  (long) representations. the con-
formal weight of these long representations is not protected by anything and they can
therefore correspond to nonchiral operators. in particular the spectrum of chiral opera-
tors can jump as we move around in the moduli space.

2; 1

2, 1

unfortunately, there only a few things we can do to decide whether one of the options
(i)-(iv) gives the right spectrum of chiral operators. one possibility is to examine whether
the resulting spectrum is in agreement with the modular invariance constraints discussed
at the end of section 3. another possibility is to compute the spectrum of chiral operators

17

of known a theories and to match those to the kk spectrum in the hope of identifying
the precise boundary theory. the rst possibility is somewhat problematic to apply.
first of all, we do not know where to truncate the spectrum, and furthermore, there is
no obvious map from a unitary a theory to a unitary a with nite multiplicities. still,
if we assume that the spectrum of chiral primaries of an a theory should satisfy the
same constraints as the spectrum of an a and if we truncate the spectrum to keep only
states with l
total < k/2 we see that option (i) is not compatible with
modular invariance, but, quite surprisingly, options (ii), (iii) and (iv) are compatible with
modular invariance. nevertheless, we should probably not attach too much value to these
observations.

total < k/2 and l

what about the spectrum of known a theories? almost all known a and a theories
are associated to certain so-called wolf spaces [7, 3133]. a preliminary investigation
shows that the spectra of chiral operators of such wolf space theories are quite distinct
from the kaluza-klein spectrum (4.4). another natural series of a theories to consider
is that of orbifolds of known a theories. in the case of ads/cft dualities involving the
small n = 4 algebra, the conformal eld theory is a sigma model on a symmetric product
symk(m4) [3436, 14, 3740]. symmetric products appear naturally as the conguration
space of unordered branes, so here we are led to consider sn orbifolds of a theories. in
fact, the kk spectrum in (4.4) is highly reminiscent of that of an orbifold theory. however,
the a theories depend on two integers k, and the central charge in general is fractional,
so it is not a priori clear what type of orbifold to write down for general k. the kk
spectrum looks like that of a sigma model on a space of the form symk+
(m)),
but clearly this cannot be true. to get a clue one can rst consider various limiting
cases. in the limit k  k+, one of the two d1-d5 (or m2-m5 in the m-theory case)
systems approximately decouples and one expects the considerations of the standard d1-
in our case, the d5 brane is wrapped on s1  s3. this suggest
d5 system to apply.
that the theory is related to a sigma model on symk
(u(2)), where we used the fact that
u(2) is topologically s1  s3. as we will see in section 7, classical sigma models with a
symmetry have as target space a hyperkahler manifold with torsion and compatible u(2)
action. clearly, symk
(u(2)) is hyperkahler, and has a natural u(2) action. the fact
that we need torsion implies that we should consider a u(2) wzw model. this leads to
the proposal:

(symk

for general k+, k the scft is a supersymmetric sigma model with target space
(u(2)), with k/k units of h = db ux and certain discrete gauge elds associ-

symk
ated to the permutation group sk turned on.

since the original brane conguration is invariant under exchange of k+ and k, this

18

proposal requires the equivalence of the respective sigma models on symk
(u(2)) and
symk+(u(2)). as explained in section 7, only one of the two sigma models can be weakly
coupled for given k+, k, and in this sense this duality is reminiscent of level-rank duality.
it would be interesting to nd a direct proof of this duality.

it may seem puzzling that we allow a fractional ux of h = db in the conformal eld
theory. a tentative description of this theory is as follows. in order to dene a sigma
model with target space m and h 6= 0, we include a term

swz = 2izx,x=

h

(5.2)

in the action. here, x is a three-manifold in target space whose boundary is the world-
sheet . this term should be independent of the choice of x and this requires that
h  h 3(m, z). it is well-known that this statement is modied if there are also chiral
world-sheet fermions coupled to background gauge elds a in the action. in this case it is
h  = dbtcs(a) rather than h which should be in h 3(m, z), where cs(a) refers to the
chern-simons three-form, and t is proportional to the number of chiral fermions. in our
case there are no continuous gauge elds a, but there are discrete sk gauge elds. by
this we mean that every world-sheet embedded in the non-singular part of symk
(u(2))
naturally carries an sk bundle. given a three-manifold x with boundary  and some
sk bundle, a topological action can be dened as in [41]. the dierent topological actions
are classied by elements  of h 3(bsk, u(1)), where bsk is the classifying space of
the nite group sk. we choose an element  such that the action for s3/zk (with the
obvious zk bundle which is also an sk bundle) is equal to exp(2i/k). (we have
not shown that this is possible for general k, but for small k we veried that such an
element exists). we now include in the path integral the topological action associated to
k. this depends only on k mod k. in particular, if k is a multiple of k, this topological
action is trivial. the topological action together with the standard sigma model action
with the wess-zumino term (5.2) with fractional db ux yields a sigma model that does
not depend on the choice of the three-manifold x, and is well-dened for all values of
k+, k.

the level of the su(2) current algebra associated to the diagonal su(2) action on
symk
(u(2)) is given by the integral of h over the orbit of su(2) = s3 in the symmetric
product. this s3 is in homology equal to k times a 3-cycle of the form12 s3/zk. it
is with respect to this latter cycle that units of ux are dened, so the level of su(2) is

) where g0 =
diag(e2i/k , e2i/k )  u (2). after modding out by sk this orbit is a k-fold cover of su (2)/zk,
where z

19

k(k/k) = k.

conformal invariance of the sigma model will impose constraints on the metric on
symk
(u(2)). for special values of k there exists an exact scft description of the sigma
model, and our proposal coincides with the conjecture in [10, 11]. namely, if k is a multiple
of k, k = qk, the topological action is trivial and the sigma model can be described by
the orbifold conformal eld theory (u(2)q)k
/sk, where u(2)q is the level q, u(2), n = 1
super wzw model. this is indeed a sigma model with target space symk
(u(2)) and
q units of 3-form ux. we expect the sigma model for arbitrary rational q to be closely
related to an analytic continuation of the exact scfts that exist for integer q. indeed,
if we analytically continue the central charge of (u(2)q)k
/sk to rational q, we nd the
right value

c = k(3/2 + 3(q  2)/q + 3/2) = 6k(q  1)/q = 6k+k/k

(5.3)

where the rst factor of 3/2 comes from the supersymmetric u(1) factor, the second factor
from the bosonic part of the su(2) wzw theory and the last one from the corresponding
fermions. the truncation of spins can also be analytically continued to arbitrary q = k/k.
in the su(2)q2 theory, the maximal spin of a primary eld is (q  2)/2. thus in the
orbifold the maximal spin is k(q2)/2. this is half-integer precisely when q is a multiple
of 1/k.

in the remaining of this section we analyze the spectrum of chiral primaries for some
special cases with k = qk and compare the result to the kk spectrum obtained from
supergravity. the conformal weights of nonchiral operators can change as we vary the
moduli, only the conformal weights of chiral operators are protected, and the chiral op-
erators with a small conformal weight should be present in the kk spectrum in order for
the duality to be valid.

first we consider some general aspects of sn orbifolds of a theories. the rr sector
of an sn orbifold can be decomposed in various subsectors as in [42]. consider a chiral
rr state in the zp1 twisted sector with quantum numbers l+
1 , and another one in the
zp2 twisted sector with quantum numbers l+
2 . we suppress the dependence on u(1)
momenta in this discussion. the conformal weight of chiral operators in the r sector is
given by

1 , l

2 , l

hr(l+, l, k+, k) =

((l+ + l)2 +

k+k).

(5.4)

thus the two states mentioned above have conformal weight hr(l+
1 , p1k+, p1k) and
hr(l+
2 , p2k+, p2k), if k+ and k are the levels of the original theory that we are
orbifolding. if we combine the two states to make one in the p1 + p2 twisted sector, we

do not always get a new chiral operator. we do have the following inequality

(5.5)

(5.6)

thus only specic states in the twisted sectors can combine to give chiral primaries in
the full theory. a second subtlety is that states that obey the equality (5.4) are not
necessarily primaries of the original theory. descendants that satisfy (5.4) will give rise
to chiral primaries in zp twisted sectors for suciently large p.

let us now apply this to the sk orbifold of the theory with k+ = q  1, k = 1. the
latter theory has only massless representations and the quantum numbers of the chiral
primary operators in the rr sector (labeled by (l+, l; l+, l)) are [25]

the rst and fourth state are bosonic, the second and third state are fermionic. they
satisfy l+ + l = l+ + l = j+1

primary operators in order to get a chiral primary operator in the orbifold theory is to
take states with l+ + l = l+ + l = j+1
in the zj+1 twisted sector. this follows from

condition (5.6). by means of spectral ow [43] we nd a set of ns states generated by

all these states are present in the kk spectrum (4.4), and form a natural ring because
they satisfy l+ = l, l+ = l, see section 3. besides the states generated by (5.8), there
will in general be additional chiral primaries as explained above. however, the spins of
most of these states become very large as k  , and we do not expect to see any sign
of them in the supergravity spectrum. this can be seen as follows. if we combine states
from twisted sectors they should satisfy p pi = k and (l+
i )/pi = r where r is some
xed number independent of i. the spin of the combined state satises l+ + l = rk.
after spectral ow the spins in the ns sector obey l+  l = (r  1/2)k. if we send k
to innity, we need r = 1/2 to keep l nite. most of the additional states have r 6= 1/2
and are invisible in supergravity. states with r = 1/2 can be used to build arbitrary
multiparticle states in the rr sector. the same is true in the ns sector because r = 1/2

i + l

21

implies l+ = l. all this supports the picture that the chiral primaries carry the structure
of a module over a ring, the ring being generated by the chiral primaries with l+ = l.

finally, we illustrate the appearance of additional chiral primaries due to the existence
of descendants that satisfy (5.4). consider the case with q = 2. the n = 1 u(2)2 wzw
theory is a theory consisting of one free boson and four free fermions. in the rr sector
of this theory there are several descendants that satisfy (5.4). their left moving part is
of the form

tanan1...a1qan

1|i

nqan1

(n1) . . . qa1

(5.9)

where |i is a ground state in the ramond sector, and the tensor t is chosen so the
su(2) spins of the state (5.9) are maximal. these descendants give rise to the rr chiral
primaries

6 d-brane analysis

in the case of the iib conguration, one can study the boundary scft using d-brane
perturbation theory. indeed, this is how the boundary scft was identied in the case
of the d1-d5 system. we consider the dynamics in the substringy regime, so the rele-
vant degrees of freedom are the ones that come from open strings stretching between the
various branes. by considering strings with boundary conditions dictated by the d-brane
conguration one can easily obtain the massless degrees of freedom. 11 strings yield a 2d
vector multiplet and 5151 and 5252 yield 6d vector multiplets. 151 and 152 strings yield 6d
hypermultiplets. finally there are 5152 strings that yield a single complex fermionic eld,
localized in the intersection of the 5152 system. one could study the system from the
point of view of either brane by introducing a corresponding probe brane and studying
its worldvolume theory. consider for instance the case of a probe d1 brane positioned in
(x0, x1). the 151 and 152 strings imply that the worldvolume theory contains two hyper-
multiplets. these hypermultiplets interact in a non-local manner through the 5152 strings.
to lowest order one has the interaction coming from the one-loop diagram 1515152521.
one could obtain these interactions by integrating out the 5152 strings. these interac-
tions cannot be ignored even at low-energies as 5152 strings contain a massless degree of
freedom. for the same reason, integrating out these strings introduces a singularity in the
worldvolume theory. this complicates the analysis of the vacuum structure of the theory.

22

we will not attempt such an analysis here. we only note that we also encountered some,
perhaps related, non-locality in the supergravity description of the system. there we saw
that in order to compactify the  coordinate we had to identify large scales in the one
d1-d5 system with small scales of the other d1-d5 system (see (2.22)). in both cases,
in the large k+ limit keeping k xed (or vice versa) the non-locality goes away. in the
same limit there is a weakly coupled sigma model realization of a as we discuss in the
next section.

 model

in this section we describe a natural class of -models with a symmetry and some
of their properties. this class includes the ones that we proposed as duals of the string
theory on ads3  s3  s3  s1. previous work in this direction includes the realizations
of a theories via wolf spaces [7, 3133], and on more general sigma models in [44].

it will be easiest to work in n = 1 superspace. the a algebra can be written in
n = 1 superspace [33] because it is a linear algebra, and contains then the super stress-
energy tensor of weight 3/2, three spin-one supercurrents and four superelds of spin 1/2.
to realize this algebra we consider a generic n = (1, 1) sigma model

with

s =z d2zd2 (g + b )d+x dx 

d+ =  + ,

d =  +  .

(7.1)

(7.2)

suppose the action is invariant under a symmetry x , with  satisfying d = 0. then
by varying the action with an arbitrary unconstrained parameter the variation will be of
the form

s =z d2zd2 (d)(2j)

(7.3)

where j is the noether current of the symmetry. on-shell it satises dj = 0. since we
want to realize three spin one and four spin one-half symmetries in the sigma model we
write as ansatz for the corresponding symmetries

x  = j 
x  = u 

(a) d+x ,
(a),

a = 1, 2, 3

a = 0, 1, 2, 3

(7.4)

(7.5)

where we have three antisymmetric tensors j(a) and four vector elds u(a). as is well
known, these transformation are symmetries of the action if j(a) and u(a) are covariantly

23

constant with respect to the covariant derivative with torsion,

 j 
+

(a) = +

 u 

(a) = 0.

in that case we nd corresponding noether currents

a = u(a)d+x 
sa = 
furthermore, the stress energy tensor is

(7.10)

next, we consider the poisson brackets of these noether currents. ideally, these should
give us the opes of a. however, some terms in the opes can come from higher
order contractions between elds in the noether currents and can therefore not be seen
in the poisson brackets. the parts of the opes that come from tree level contractions
should be correctly reproduced by the poisson brackets, and this implies several geometric
constraints on the sigma model. we will omit the details of this analysis. one of the
interesting equations one encounters is that the antisymmetric tensors j(a) have to satisfy,
in the sense of matrix multiplication,

j(a)  j(b) = ab +

k  k+

k

abcj(c).

however, the algebra of js is not associative unless

(k  k+)2

k2

= 1

(7.11)

(7.12)

which means k+ = 0 or k = 0. this is clearly not what we want. the point is that (7.12)
only needs to be valid up to higher order corrections. we can therefore allow the situation
where k+  k and k/k+ is what controls the quantum corrections (or k  k+ and
k+/k controls the quantum corrections), because then (7.12) is valid up to quantum
corrections. this is also consistent with the fact that for a sigma model interpretation
the central charge should be 3/2 times the dimension of the target space up to quantum
corrections. indeed, for k+  k, the central charge is c = 6k(1 + o(k/k+)), which
shows that the target space should have dimension 4k, and similarly with the roles of

24

k+ and k reversed. an analogous situation would appear if we would consider a wzw
model for a group of dimension 4k at level k+. this is all consistent with the realizations
related to wolf spaces, where one of the levels is related to the the dimension of the wolf
space, and the other to the level of the underlying wzw model.

altogether this suggests that for k+  k, a theories can potentially be described by
weakly coupled sigma models on spaces of dimension 4k. as we decrease k+, the quantum
corrections become stronger and stronger, until they are so large that the target space is
no longer visible. as we then continue parameters to k+  k, another weakly coupled
sigma model description appears, namely one where the target space has dimension 4k+.

thus, a necessary condition for the sigma model under consideration to have a a
symmetry is that the corresponding classical sigma model should have an a symmetry
with k+ = 0 or k = 0. the geometric conditions for this are that the target space should
be a hyperkahler manifold with torsion with compatible u(2) action (as dened in [45]).
this should be true for both choices of torsion in the covariant derivatives    +h.
it was shown in [45] that if m is hyperkahler with torsion and compatible u(2) action,
m/u(2) is quaternionic kahler with torsion and all quaternionic kahler manifolds can
be obtained this way. we therefore see a close relation between quaternionic manifolds
and the a algebra, but to actually construct a sigma model we should not use the
quaternionic space as target space but rather the hyperkahler space it descended from.

a space which satises the above requirements is the sigma model with target space
(u(2))k
/sk. this has an obvious (diagonal) action of u(2) from the left and right; once
we choose a nonzero 3-form ux together with suitable discrete gauge elds and appro-
priate metric for this diagonal u(2), the u(2) action is compatible with the hyperkahler
structure with torsion. thus our candidate scft has the right properties to correspond
to an exact conformal invariant a theory.

it would be interesting to understand the sigma models with a symmetry in some
more detail, and in particular to nd the geometric interpretation of the notion of chiral
primaries and of the ring structure of chiral primaries with l+ = l. quaternionic mani-
folds have various interesting cohomologies [46, 47], whose relation to the chiral operators
remains to be explored.

8 discussion and open problems

in this paper we studied the ads/cft duality in the case the boundary scft has the
large n = 4 superconformal symmetry. we have presented supergravity solutions that

25

in their near-horizon limit contain ads3  s3  s3, and computed the corresponding kk
spectrum. we proposed that the boundary scft is (possibly a deformation of) a sigma
model with target space symk
(u(2)), k/k units of 3-form ux, and suitable discrete
gauge elds, and found that this is consistent with the kk spectrum and has the right
qualitative properties.

there are many issues that deserve further study. it will be interesting to analyze in
more detail the iib conguration using d-brane perturbation theory. in particular, to
consider a probe brane and to obtain all couplings to the rst non-trivial order. as noted
in section 6, certain couplings are expected to rst appear at one-loop level. since there
are massless states running in these loops, one cannot ignore these couplings even in low
energies. these couplings, however, are of order 1/n. knowing in detail the worldvolume
theory will presumably also help us understand the meaning of the identication (2.22)
needed in supergravity in order to compactify one of the near-horizon coordinates.
furthermore, the moduli space of the gauge theory should be related to symk

(u(2)).

another issue is to provide a more precise formulation of the boundary scft, and
more stringent tests of the conjectured duality. in particular, the precise meaning of the
discrete uxes and the correct treatment of the singularities (for a recent discussion see
[40]) deserves further clarication. a more detailed comparison of the spectrum of the
boundary scft with that of supergravity is also desirable. this requires a more detailed
understanding of the spectrum of the boundary scft. a useful tool may be the index
recently proposed in [39] which plays the role of the elliptic genus for a theories. once
the spectra are better understood one could go on and compare correlation functions in
the two descriptions.

in summary, it appears that for generic k+, k there is no useful semi-classical de-
scription. the a -models are only weakly coupled for k+  k (or vice versa), the
worldvolume gauge theory contains non-local interactions that are only suppressed at
large n, and the supergravity solution implies a 3d solution only if there are identica-
tions of order 1/n. nevertheless, the large amount of symmetry and exact knowledge of
the theory at k = qk may be sucient to provide a non-perturbative solution.

independently of the considerations regarding the ads/cft duality, it is an interest-
ing question to investigate which theories ow in the infrared to a xed point with a
symmetry. it is also interesting to further study the -models with a symmetry, and in
particular to understand the geometric notion of chiral primaries.

there is an interesting connection between our considerations and the issue of creation
of branes when branes cross each other. consider the case of two d5 branes intersecting

26

over a string, say in 12345 and 16789, respectively, and with an electric eld along the
string. after t-duality along x1 one gets two d4 branes with a relative velocity in the
circle direction. as shown in [48], an open string is created when the two d4 branes cross
each other. this phenomenon is u-dual to the creation of a single d3-brane when a d5-
brane crosses an ns5-brane[49]. lifting the iia conguration to m-theory we get that an
m2-brane is created when two m5 branes cross each other. in particular, the branes are
positioned as in the m-theory conguration we described in section 2. thus, the vebranes
interact through the creation (or annihilation) of m2 branes, and the boundary scft
should capture some of the dynamics of this phenomenon.
