abstract

no positive result has been obtained on the magnetic monopoles search. this allows to consider
dierent theoretical approaches as the proposed in this paper, developed in the framework of the
einstein general relativity. the properties of second rank skew-symmetrical elds are the basis
of electromagnetic theories. in the space-time the hodge duality of these elds is narrowly related
with the rotations in the so(2) group. an axiomatic approach to a dual electromagnetic theory is
presented. the main result of this paper is that the stress-energy tensor can be decomposed on two
parts: the parallel and the perpendicular. the parallel part is easily integrated on the lagrangian
approach, while some problems appears with the perpendicular part. a solution with the parallel
part alone is found, it generates a non-standard model of magnetic monopoles neutral to the electric
charges.

introduction

the concept of magnetic monopole extends the meaning of the maxwell equations, by providing a
symmetric view of electric and magnetic elds. the asymmetry of these equations has been for a long
time a motivational phenomenon in both the theoretical[1, 2] and experimental[3] aspects. according
with hawking and ross[4], the belief that electrically and magnetically charged black holes have identical
quantum properties provides a new interest in all questions related with electromagnetic duality[5, 6, 7, 8].
additionally, as asserted by lee[5], the magnetic monopole dynamic is related to strongly interacting
elementary particles. most of the works in electromagnetic duality are dealing with quantum aspect,
while as appointed by israelit[9, 10], little attention is considered to construct a correct classical theory
in the general relativistic arena. the classical theory can be considered as a limit of quantum theory,
therefore advances in the rst can be useful to the second[11]. the construction of a classical theory of
electromagnetic duality is not a closed matter. a pending problem deals with the duality invariance of
both the stress-energy tensor and the lagrange action[4, 8, 12].

in classical eld theory, if the electromagnetic eld is constructed from a potential vector as: fab =
2[aab], the vanishing of the second set of maxwell equations, [afbc] = 0, is due to a property of the
riemann curvature tensor: rd
[abc] = 0. the denition of the eld or the ane properties of the space-
time must be changed to obtain a full electromagnetic duality with symmetrical maxwell equations.
first type of theories can include dierent eld denitions from the potential vector, as in the yang-
mills model based on gauge theories[6, 13, 14]. second type of theories can include torsion properties
in the space-time, as based on weil geometry[9, 15]. any theory which modies some of these aspects
can generate a non-vanishing second set of maxwell equations, and consequently some type of magnetic
monopolar current.

electromagnetic duality is related with the symmetrical role of electric and magnetic elds in the
maxwell equations. the hodge duality is an useful tool to deal with this equation symmetry. it becomes
a cornerstone to connect the physical and the mathematical concepts of duality. the double duality
transformation in four-dimensional space-time generates an identity with negative sign. from far, this

fact has been qualitatively associated with the rotation in a plane[16](p 108). recently an increased
interest arises in the symplectic structure of the electromagnetic equations[17, 18] and also in the so(2)
symmetrical group embedded in the duality[19, 20, 21, 22]. chan and tsou[23, 24] show some of the
problems with duality in the classical theory, and extend it to nonabelian gauge theory.

in the classical domain of general relativity the electromagnetic eld can be represented by the
skew-symmetrical strength tensor fab, while in a quantum domain it must be potential based due
to the bohm-aharonov eect[14, 24, 25].
in this paper a non-quantum approach is presented, the
electromagnetic duality is obtained from the formal properties of the skew-symmetrical tensors rather
than induced from an a priori magnetic monopole model.

the hodge duality is a cornerstone of electromagnetic duality. on a space-time with d = 4k dimen-
sionality, it generates a so(2) symmetrical group[19, 21]. the other cornerstone is the poincare lemma.
it denes the necessary and sucient condition for the existence of solutions involving dierential forms.
in this paper the solution to the general symmetrical maxwell equations is fragmented on pieces based
on closed forms. this is achieved using a two potential approach also used previously in electromagnetic
duality[28, 35].

the plan of this paper is as follows. the sec. 2 contains most of the mathematical tools used
along the paper.
it is being presented in a formal way comprising a set of denitions, propositions
and theorems, including also most of the deductive machinery. this section is partially an experiment
in order to nd a reduced set of mathematical elements needed to construct the basis of an axiomatic
electromagnetic theory. the sec. 3 presents the equations of the electromagnetic eld as are deduced
from the axiomatic. the sec. 4 deals with the duality invariance, including an invariant formulation for
the maxwell equations and the stress-energy tensor. the sec. 5 presents a model of lagrange function.
finally, the sec. 6 is related with the particle-eld and particle-particle interactions.

2 the axiomatic of class em
the tensor class em is described as a tensor family with a common property. a set of denitions,
propositions and theorems are formally presented, all are related with equations involving second rank
skew-symmetric tensors. this section is linearly presented, such as most of the propositions and theorem
become immediately proved from previous assertions. as in general relativity a (m, gab) model of the
space-time is considered, where m is a four-dimensional c connected manifold and gab is a metric
on m with signature: {1, 1, 1, 1}. a p-form and a skew-symmetric tensor of rank p are equivalent
representations used along this section as:

x =

1
p!

xa1apwa1    wap  x[a1ap]

(1)

in a general basis, while for a coordinate basis wk = dxk. the wedge product  of a p-form and a
q-form is a (p + q)-form which veries: x y = (1)pqy x. the dual of a p-form, x, is a (n p)-form,
x, where n = 4 and 0  p  n. it is dened as[13](p 36):

x =

1

(n  p)! (cid:20) 1

a1an x a1ap(cid:21) wap+1    wan

(2)

p!

where abcd is the levi-civita fourth rank completely skew-symmetric tensor, with 0123 = g, and

g is the metric determinant. throughout this paper the dual of rst, second and third rank tensors will
be considered, based on the previous expression they are dened as[16](p 88):

abcd = abcdaa

bcd =

1
2

abcdbab

cd =

3!

abcdc abc

(3)

the double duality veries that: x = (1)p1 x. it is veried that: a = a, b = b and

c = c.

2.1 linear expressions

for an 1-form u = uawa the exterior derivative can be expressed from the tensorial derivative as:
(d  u)ab = (d  u)ab  (d  u)ba, so if: d  u = (aub)wa  wb, it is obtained that:

d  u = du = (aub  bua)wa  wb

(4)

for the general case, the derivative of a p-form is a (p + 1)-form expressed in terms of the covariant

derivative:

y = dx  ya1ap = a1 xa2ap  a2 xa1ap +  (1)papxa1ap1

for a scalar , an 1-form u and a 2-form x, it is veried that:

d  a
du  aub  bua = 2[aub]
dx  axbc  bxac + cxab = 3[axbc]

(5)

(6)
(7)

(8)

it is veried that dd = 0, that is dy = 0 in the equation (5). the co-derivative x of a p-form is a
(p  1)-form expressed as: x = dx in the four-dimensional space-time[13](p 40). for an 1-form is
veried that:
(9)
if  is a scalar: d  (cid:3), where (cid:3) = aa is the second order dierential operator. also for a
(10)

z = x  z = axa

2-form:

z = x  za = bxba
if u is an 1-form in a curved space-time, it is veried that:

du + du  (cid:3)ua + rb

aub

(11)

where rb

a is the ricci tensor. it is also veried that:  = 0, that is z = 0 in the previous cases.

denition 1. a second rank tensor x  em0 if it is skew-symmetric, it means that: xab + xba = 0.

denition 2. a tensor x  em1, also called an -eld, if x  em0 and also it veries: dx = 0,
equivalent to: [axbc] = 0.

denition 3. a tensor x  em2, also called a -eld, if x  em0 and also it veries: x = 0,
equivalent to: bx ab = 0.

these classes verify that: em1  em0 and em2  em0. two new classes can be introduced,
the rst as intersection of the previous, em3 = em1  em2, which veries that: [axbc] = 0 and
bx ab = 0. the other class is: em4 = em0  em1  em2, which veries that: [axbc] 6= 0 and
bx ab 6= 0.
proposition 1. if x  em0, the third rank tensor 3[axbc] and the vector (1)b
reciprocally, the tensor 3[a

xbc] and the vector bx ab are also dual.

x ab are both dual.

proposition 2. if x  em1, then x  em2 and reciprocally.
proof. if x  em1 then dx = 0, therefore it is veried that: x = dx = dx = 0. the reciprocal
is also right, if x  em2 then x = 0, therefore it is veried that: dx = (1)2dx = 0.

denition 4. if x  em0, and the vector z is dened as: z = x, that is: za = bxab, it is called
the -current of x, and it veries that: z = 0.

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

denition 5. if x  em0, and the vector y is dened as: y = x, that is: ya = b xab, it is
called the -current of x, and it veries that: y = 0.

proposition 3. if {z, y} are the  and -current of x, then {y,z} are the  and -current of x.

theorem 1 (maxwell-like). any tensor x  em0 veries the next equations, where z and y are its
 and -current respectively.
(12)

x = y

x = z

verifying that z = 0 and y = 0.

from proposition 1 these equations can be expressed in tensorial form as:

bx ab = z a

[bxcd] = 

1
3

abcdy a

where az a = 0 and ay a = 0. for the dual x, it is veried that:
abcdz a

x ab = y a

xcd] =

b

[b

3

(13)

(14)

these become the symmetrical maxwell-like equations system and the current conservation laws which
are the starting point for the construction of the electromagnetic duality. the em1 or the em2 classes
are obtained if y = 0 or z = 0.

proposition 4. if x  em1, it can be expressed from a vector eld u as:

x = du  xab = aub  bua

(15)

proof. it follows from the poincare lemma[13](p 21), [26](p 141). in this case x is closed, dx = 0,
then it must be exact, x = du. however, the vector eld u is not univocally dened, being possible
a transformation as: u = u + d, where  is a scalar eld. it is veried that: du = du, due to:
dd = 0. to x this scalar it is imposed an additional equation as the lorentz gauge: u = 0. this
restriction becomes:

d = 0  (cid:3) = 0

(16)

proposition 5. if z is a vector eld verifying z = 0, then exist solution for x  em1 expressed as:
(17)

x = z

dx = 0

proof. from the double duality it is concluded that if a p-form is null also is null its dual, so from
z = dz = 0 it is concluded that z is closed. based on the poincare lemma it must be exact, this
is: dx = z, therefore exist x. this is not univocally dened, it is veried that: x = x + v, where
v  em3.

theorem 2 (split). any eld x  em0 can be expressed by means of two auxiliary -elds, xab
and xab, such as:

xab = xab  
xab = xab + 

xab
xab

where each auxiliary eld veries the following expressions based on the  and  currents of x:

  x = z
  x = y

  
  

x = 0
x = 0

(18)
(19)

(20)
(21)

proof. firstly if x  em1 or x  em2 the theorem is immediately proved by choosing null any of the
two auxiliary elds. the other case is x  em4 with non-null sources. the auxiliary elds x and x
are chosen according with the equations (20) and (21). from the previous proposition it is proved that
there are solution for both elds, however these solutions are not univocally dened. therefore these
solutions can verify that:

(22)
however it is obtained that d  em3. due to em3  em1, it can be introduced a new tensor:
ab = (xab + dab)  em1, consequently verifying that: xab = x 

dab = xab  xab + 

xab 6= 0.

ab  

xab.

x 

proposition 6. if a and b belong to em1 and not to em3, the solution for the equation:

 b + a = 0

(23)

where  and  are constant, is that:  =  = 0, i.e. a and b are lineally independent.

proof. from the previous conditions must be: da = db = 0 and also a 6= 0 and b 6= 0. however it
is veried that from: db + da = 0, it must be:  = 0. also from: b + a = 0, and due that
b =  db = 0, it must be:  = 0. therefore in the general case the em2 class is non-reducible to
em1 and reciprocally because both are lineally independent.

proposition 7. if x  em3, it can be expressed by two co-potential vectors, {ua, va} as:

xab = aub  bua

xab = avb  bva

(24)

2.2 bilinear expressions
some useful properties of the tensor class em0 can be obtained by using bilinear expressions. all are
based on a basic property related with a partial double duality transformation.

proposition 8. if the fourth rank tensor h veries that:

it is veried that:

proof. it is based on the properties of the  and  tensors[13](p 75).

and the symmetric second rank tensor w veries that:

3 the axiomatic equations of the electromagnetic eld

the class em0 can be considered as an abstract and formal representation of a dual electromagnetic
eld. due to the existence of magnetic monopoles is an hypothesis, any theoretical approach to this
concept must be based on some axiomatic. the only condition imposed in this paper is that the eld
can be represented by a skew-symmetrical second rank tensor.

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

7

the electromagnetic eld can be formally represented by a second rank skew-symmetric tensor f 
em0. based on theorems 1, 2 and 3, this tensor has some associated tensors: an -current, j, a
-current, j, and a stress-energy tensor t. they verify that:

  f = 4 j
 f = 4 j
f bc)

(facf bc + fac

t b

a =

1
8

 j = 0
 j = 0
  t = j  f + j f

(45)

(46)

(47)

these equations are duality invariant, specically the expression of the stress-energy tensor match
with a general invariant form[27]. one of both the -current or the -current is an electric current and
the other one is a monopolar magnetic current. both choice are valid because provide the same formal
symmetry to maxwell equations. in this paper, j and j are considered respectively as the electric
and the magnetic monopolar currents.

a dierence appears when this formal derivation is compared with the classical theory of the electro-
magnetic eld. instead of a potential vector, a, two potential vectors, a and a, can be considered
based on the theorem 2. also two auxiliary elds f and f  em1 are introduced. they verify that:
(48)
(49)

f = f  
f

fab = a ab  b aa
fab = a ab  b aa

each potential vector is independently related with its current type as:

 (cid:3) aa + rb
(cid:3) aa + rb

a ab = 4 ja
a ab = 4 ja

(50)

(51)

(52)

in an electromagnetic duality hypothesis, two independent currents must be considered: the magnetic
and the electric sources. two approaches can be considered for mapping these sources in an electro-
magnetic eld. in this paper, similarly to other works on electromagnetic duality[28, 35], two vector
elds are considered, this choice preserves the radial vs axial properties of elds. the magnetic eld
generated by a magnetic charge is of radial type based on the gradient of a scalar, while the magnetic
eld generated by a electric charge is of axial type based on a curl. in a full electromagnetic duality two
radial and two axial eld are involved. most works in electromagnetic duality t the dual sources into a
single vector eld. this task needs of some heuristic as the dirac string monopole, which is a topological
construction[36, 34].

the existence of magnetic monopoles is an hypothesis that extended the symmetry of maxwell
equations towards the symmetry of charges[29]. the eld generated by a singular electric charge is well
mapped into a vector potential. while that, if the eld generates by a magnetic monopole is mapped
in the same vector potential, the expected symmetry is broken. it appears two dierent concepts: the
point singular electric charge and the string singular magnetic monopole. the dirac quantization arises
as a condition imposed to avoid the physical eect of the string[29] [13](p 165).

if a full symmetrical duality is desired, the topological counterpart of a point singular electric charge
must be other one. based on the theorem 2 a simple and symmetrical solution is found by using two
potential vectors. this approach has some advantages because a switch between the elds f  f is
reduced, as shown equation (48), to a switch between the two auxiliary elds: f  f and f   f,
which is more similar to the current switch: j  j and j   j as is deduced from equations
(45) and (46).

4 duality invariance

the duality invariance is related to how eld properties are modied with the transposition: f  f.
some equation changes are expected with this transposition. invariant equations are preferred because it
is supposed that both representations, f and f are equivalents. the main principle involved in duality

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

8

invariance is that both descriptions have the same information, therefore both descriptions must be valid
representations of the physical fact. non privileged reference system can be found in general relativity
to study the physical laws, consequently all reference system are equivalent for this propose. by analogy,
any symbol which have the same information should be equivalent to study the physical laws.

instead of invariance in a discrete transposition as f  f, it is required a continuous invariance
related with a rotation phase  between the two elds. a complex tensor can be introduced to deal with
this rotations: f + f. in this case a rotation generates the complex tensor: e(f + f). duality
invariance must be considered as mathematical invariance to rotations. as well as in general relativity
the covariant representation is introduced to be independent of any coordinate systems, a representation
invariant to phase  must be introduced. equivalent to the representation in the complex plane, a
continuous transformation is introduced as:

f = f cos  + f sin 

(53)

by taking its dual: f = f cos   f sin , it is obtained a representation based on a rotation

matrix, r(), similar to the used by deser et al.[8, 21]:

f (cid:19)
(cid:18) f

= r()(cid:18) f

f (cid:19)

r() = (cid:18) cos 

 sin  cos  (cid:19)

sin 

(54)

a duality plane, d = 2, is introduced in addition to the riemannian space-time with d = 4. this
approach clearly evidences the well known connection between the duality problem and the rotation
invariance, in this case with the so(2) group. the tensors having two parts, e.g.  and , can be
represented by extended tensors with uppercase index:

lai...

a... m ai...

a...

a = 0, 1 a, ..., i, ... = 0, 1, 2, 3

(55)

b

any extended tensor, laa

, can be expressed symbolically in short as: la, la

b and also as l, by
abstracting some or all the index types. the covariant and contravariant uppercase index are related
with the symmetrical group while the lowercase index are related with the space-time. e.g. the electro-
magnetic eld tensors, which have a dual interpretation, are represented by the extended tensors: f c
ab,
ac

a , such as: f 0

ab = fab and f 1

a and j c

ab = fab. the maxwell equations are:
(cid:18) f

f (cid:19) = 4(cid:18) j

j (cid:19)

(56)

(57)

it is obtained that:

j (cid:19)
(cid:18) j

= r()(cid:18) j

j (cid:19)

transformed as follows:

the concept of rotation in the em0 class is extended to all  and  related tensors. they are
(58)

i...
a... = r()li...

a...

l

in the duality plane the symmetrical identity tensor, ab, and the skew-symmetrical tensor, ab are

considered. they are represented as:

 = (cid:18) 1

0

0

1 (cid:19)

1

 = (cid:18) 0

1 0 (cid:19)

(59)

if t is the transpose of , it is veried that: t  = , and also:  = . the metric tensor allows
the use of covariant and contravariant components related to: ai...
. two operators are
introduced in the duality plane. the following expression are called the scalar and the vectorial products
in the duality plane, which are operators based on the previous matrices:

ca... = cdadi...

these bilinear expressions are duality invariant because if rt is the transpose of the rotation matrix,

it is veried the following classical expressions of the rotations groups:

rt ()r() = 

rt ()r() = 

(62)

any matrix, , which generates a bilinear invariant operator must verify: rt ()r() = , but any
solution of this equation can be expressed as a linear combination of the previous:  = a + b, where a
and b are constant. this is due to:

r() =  cos  +  sin 

rt () =  cos    sin 

(63)

therefore, any bilinear invariant in the duality plane can be constructed from the dened scalar and
vectorial operators. the scalar and vectorial products are symmetric and skew-symmetric respectively.
both are linear operators, symbolically expressed as:

d

 (cm + dn) = c(l
l
 (cm + dn) = c(l
l

d

d

 m) + d(l
 m) + d(l

d

d

 n)
 n)

(64)
(65)

where (c, d) are ordinary tensors, which are constant for the duality plane operators. extended tensors
allows to express the electromagnetic equations by using more compact and invariant expressions. the
equations (51) and (52) are expressed as:

the k eld is introduced to deal more easily with the rst derivative of the potential vector, it is

dened as follows:

 (cid:3) ac

a + rb

a ac

b = 4j c

a

(66)

the equation (48) is represented as:

k c
ab = a ac

b  b ac

a

fc = kc  cd kd

remark that the elds f0 and f1 are dependent due to: f1 = f0, while k0 and k1 are two
independent elds. it is possible to express the maxwell equations and the current conservation law in
a compact and invariant form as:

finally, the stress-energy tensor t can be expressed in duality invariant form as:

  fc = 4jc

  jc = 0

t b

a =

1
8

(fac

 fbc)

  t = f = j

d

 f

(69)

(70)

where f is the force density produced by the eld-current interaction. when a duality plane rotation
is produced with  = /2, a permutation between the electric and magnetic eld is veried in the eld
f, but this rotation does a permutation between  and  parts in the extended tensors: j, a and k.
this last belongs to em1 and veries the following maxwell equations:

kc = 4jc

5 lagrange function invariance

a complete electromagnetic theory must include a model of the lagrange action function. an invariant
action must be proposed to solve the variational problem i = 0, where:

in classical theory the lagrange function l is proportional to fabf ab, however this expression is not

i = z gl(a, f)d4x

(76)

duality invariant. unfortunately all the following expressions are null:
 fab = 0
 fab = 0

 fab = fab
 fab = fab

 fab = fab
 fab = fab

the lagrange function must verify three imposed restrictions. firstly it must be duality invariant.
the second restriction is that the maxwell equations must be obtained with variations of the potential
vector a. finally, the function must provide the correct expression of the stress-energy tensor with
the metric variations gab. a lot of works are recently concerning with the construction of a lagrange
function verifying these restrictions [19, 30, 22, 21].

in the approach of this paper two vector elds are considered, therefore the function must be expressed
as: l(ac , kc). the lagrange function related with the eld is composed of two terms, the rst is
concerning with the electromagnetic eld itself, and the second with the current-eld interaction:

l = lf (kc ) + li (jc , ac )

(79)

in order to generate the maxwell equations, the interaction term is based on the expression: ja

 aa.
due to t = tk + t, the lagrange function can be also expressed as: lf = lk + l. the eld term
can be constructed by using bilinear invariant expressions formed with the tensors k and k. however
the following vectorial-based bilinear expressions are null.

the lf term must be dependent of these expressions: lf (,  ). in a linear electromagnetic theory
must be: kl = ck, consequently an expression as: lf = c + c  must be considered. however, l
can not be obtained with  and  expressions, and also the  expression can be expressed as a gradient
and removed from the lagrange function:

the term  = kab

 kab is the only non-null, duality invariant and valid bilinear expression that
generates a linear electromagnetic theory. it generates the maxwell equations and provides the parallel
stress-energy tensor. the lf term can be expressed as:

where the  constant is related with the inclusion of a perpendicular term in the lagrangian. a

solution for the the lagrange function including the interaction term li is expressed as:

lf = lk + l

based on the proposition 9, it can be expressed as in the equation (72). by using the einstein
equation, g = 8t, this expression of the stress-energy tensor allows to obtain the metric and eld
associated to a charged central body as a black hole.
in the outer space of the body, the eld can
ab = qc kab, where q is the body charge, and kab is the solution for an unitary
be expressed as: k c
 q which is null. the
charge. the perpendicular stress-energy tensor is proportional to the term: q
stress-energy tensor is only based on the scalar product of the charge, being multiplied by (q)2 = q
 q,
where q is the equivalent combined charge. the reissner-nordstron metric[4, 16] arises as the solution
for this problem based on the mass m and the combined charge: (q)2. it is concluded that from the
viewpoint of the electromagnetic duality presented in this paper, the metric of an electric or magnetic
charged black hole are identical formally but dierent numerically.

6 particle-field interaction

from an operational viewpoint, a eld is the formal representation of a physical fact which determines
an interaction with some type of particle. a trajectory xa(s) is associated to each virtual particle. if
non-quantum theory is considered, the trajectory is the formal representation of the virtual particle.
a vector eld p tangent to the trajectory is considered. if the particle is massive, p = kpk 6= 0, the
trajectory has an unitary tangent vector u. the absolute derivation of p along a eld line can be
expressed as follows:

dp
ds

=

dpa
ds

ea = (bpa)ubea

(89)

due to papa is constant, it can be obtained the next expression: (bpa)ub = 2[bpa]ub. it is concluded
that the vector eld p with non-null and constant p = kpk veries the next equation along any of its
eld lines:

dpa
ds

= f a = pa

bub

(90)

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

where pab  em1 can be expressed as: pab = 2[bpa]. the vector f is the lorentz force based on a
coupling constant or particle charge, which is represented by a constant vector in the duality plane[31]:
q  (q, q). it is transformed by a rotation as[27]: q = r()q. when a phase rotation with  = /2
is performed, the charge is changed from (q, q) to (q, q). the term f = j
 f is the force density
in a continuous case. it can be expressed as: f = fk + f, its expression is:

d

fa = (jb)

 kab  (jb)

by analogy, for a virtual particle, the term ja = qua can be considered as the discrete particle current,

and the expression: f = (q

 f)  u as the force of the eld-particle interaction, its expression is:

which also is composed of the parallel and the perpendicular force. from equations (90) and (92),

the next equation must be considered to solve the particle trajectory:

this equation is non-homogeneous because the lhs is in em1 and the rhs is in em2. based on the
proposition 6, there are not a general solution for this equation. a particular solution is possible if
 kab  em3, but this implies that: q

a particular case can be obtained by considering the interaction of two particles. one is acting as the
eld source, its eld tensors are proportional to the charge q. the other particle is acting as a singular
test particle with charge q. if the electric and magnetic charges are supposed basic values multiplied by
integer numbers, being e and  the basic electric and magnetic values respectively. for a particle pair,
the scalar and the vectorial product of the charges are two interaction constants similar to the charge
product in classical electrodynamic:

 j = 0.

sponding in the quantum theory known as the zwanziger-schwinger charge quantization[5, 31, 32, 33]
which is an extension of the dirac quantization. the eld out of the source particle can be expressed
as: kab = qkab, with kab  em3. based on proposition 7 it is obtained: kab = aab  baa and
also: kab = aub  bua. the equation (94) becomes:
 qa + q

this equation can be immediately solved by means of a scalar gradient as:

where s is the particle action. consequently, the hamilton-jacobi approach is obtained for the
dynamic of the test particle, based on two co-potential vector, aa and ua. by using the two constants:
k = q

d

 q and  = q

 q, it is obtained:
(as  kaa  ua)(as  kaa  u a) = (p)2

(98)
a solution with  = 0 is valid, but in this case the magnetic monopole with charge: (0,) is
neutral to the electric charge (e, 0). in this case, due to equations (91) and (92), the operational eld
responsible of the current-eld and particle-eld interaction is the set of two independent em1 elds k,
instead of the em0 eld f.

7 conclusions

a theory of electromagnetic duality has been presented.
it has been developed in the framework of
the einstein general relativity. the proposed theory carries out the symmetry of maxwell equations,
the invariance of the stress-energy tensor, and also the invariance of part of the lagrange action. the
theory has been developed using an axiomatic method to deduce the dual maxwell equations from the
properties of dierential forms. two potential vectors are needed to deal with the two source types
involved in the electromagnetic duality.

the main result of this paper is that the stress-energy tensor can be decomposed on two parts:
the parallel and the perpendicular. in the parallel part each current type is interacting with the eld
of the same type.
in the perpendicular part the interaction becomes between currents and elds of
dierent type. the perpendicular part can not be easily integrated in a lagrange approach. on a linear
electromagnetic theory, constructed with duality invariant bilinear expressions, do not exist a suitable
expressions for this function. a lagrange function with the parallel part alone is a valid solution, it
generates a non-standard model of magnetic monopoles neutral to the electric charges.
