abstract

we consider anomaly cancelations in type iib orientifolds on t 4/zn with
quantized ns-ns sector background b-ux. for a rank b b-ux on t 4 (b is
always even) and when n is even, the cancelation requires a 2b/2 multiplicity
of states in the 59-open string sector. we identify the twisted sector r-r
scalars and tensor multiplets which are involved in the green-schwarz mech-
anism. we give more details of the construction of these models and argue
that consistency with the 2b/2 multiplicity of 59-sector states requires a mod-
ication of the relation between the open string 1-loop channel modulus and
the closed string tree channel modulus in the 59-cylinder amplitudes.

i. introduction

probably the most attractive feature of string theory is that it incorporates both quan-
tum gravity and gauge interactions in a consistent framework. a consistent string model
should therefore have the appropriate particle content and interactions such that all ap-
parent eld-theoretic gauge and/or gravitational anomalies are absent. in four dimensional
string models, there can be u(1)a gauge symmetries which are pseudo-anomalous. how-
ever, the green-schwarz mechanism [1] ensures that counterterms are generated from the
exchange of pseudoscalar elds and any eld-theoretic u(1)a triangle anomaly is canceled
by the corresponding non-trivial u(1)a transformation of the pseudoscalars.

the analysis of anomalous u(1) have mainly be focused on perturbative heterotic string
theory [2] where many semi-realistic string models can be easily constructed. in recent years,
however, tremendous progress has been made in constructing four-dimensional n = 1 type
i string models [3]. moreover, it was recently suggested that if the standard model particles
are localized on a set of p-branes where 3 < p < 9 whereas gravity lives in higher dimensional
spacetime, then the string scale can be as low as a few tev [79] . type i string theory
provides a natural framework to realize this brane world scenario [810]. in view of these
developments, it is therefore important to carry out similar analysis for type i string vacua.
anomaly cancelations in some four-dimensional n = 1 type i string models were studied
in some recent papers [12]. anomaly cancelations in d = 6 type iib zn orientifolds without
the b-ux background were studied in [13,14]. these simple examples illustrate some new
features in type i string vacua that are distinct from that of the perturbative heterotic
string. first, the r-r scalars which participate in the green-schwarz mechanism come from
the twisted sectors which can couple dierently to dierent gauge factors. therefore, in
contrast to perturbative heterotic string, there can be more than one anomalous u(1) in
these type i vacua. moreover, the fayet-iliopoulos term already appears at tree-level and
is dependent on the blowing-up modes of the orbifolds.

in this paper, we consider orientifold models with a non-vanishing ns-ns sector b-eld
background [1517]. although the uctuations of the ns-ns b-eld are projected out of the
orientifold spectrum (since it is odd under worldsheet parity reversal), a quantized vacuum
expectation value of this b-eld is allowed. furthermore, the presence of this b-eld gives
rise to some novel features. in particular, the rank of the gauge group is reduced by 2b/2
[1517] where b is the rank of the background b-eld. moreover, in models where there
are both d9 and d5-branes, the 59 sector states come with a multiplicity of 2b/2 [17].
these reduced rank orientifold models are dual to the chl strings [19] in heterotic string
theory. for models with both d9 and d5-branes, the corresponding heterotic duals contain
ns vebranes. therefore, the analysis of these orientifolds may shed some lights on the
non-perturbative properties of the chl strings.

following the work of sen [21], we also expect a close relation between orientifolds and
f theory vacua. in ref [22], some eight-dimensional f theory vacua with non-zero back-
ground b-ux were studied. naively, the presence of this ns-ns sector b-eld background
is incompatible with the sl(2, z) symmetry (the s-duality) of type iib theory. however,
the presence of this b-ux freezes 8 of the moduli of the elliptic k3, leaving only a 10-
dimensional subspace. the monodromy group on this subspace is reduced from sl(2, z)
to the congruence group 0(2) which is the largest subgroup of sl(2, z) that keeps the

2

b-ux invariant. in this paper, we consider models with both d9 and d5-branes. they can
be viewed as generalizations of f theory compactications of this kind to lower dimensions
when there are more than one type of 7-branes.

on the other hand, this class of models is closely related to the setup considered in [32].
according to [32], the positions of the branes cease to commute in the presence of a b-eld
background. it is possible that our results here can be understood from the point of view
of noncommutative geometry.

type iib orientifolds with quantized background b-eld are also interesting from the
phenomenological point of view. in the absence of b-eld, the residual gauge symmetries
are typically too large for the models to be phenomenologically interesting. since the rank of
the gauge group is reduced by 2b/2 in the presence of b-eld, it is possible to construct string
models containing the standard model with fewer additional gauge symmetries. in fact, the
three-family pati-salam like model in ref. [9] was constructed by turning on a non-zero
background b-eld with b = 2 in a z6 orientifold. there are both d9 and d5-branes in this
model. under t-duality, they become 2 sets of d5-branes: d51 and d52 whose intersection
is our four-dimensional non-compact spacetime. the standard model su(3) lives on the
d51-branes and the three chiral families of fermions in the standard model come from open
strings with at least one end attached to the d51-branes. one of the families comes from
5151 open strings whereas the other two families are 5152 open string states. the fact that
there are two families in the 5152 sector depends crucially on the multiplicity of 2b/2 = 2 in
the 5152 sector.

since the main new features in models with non-zero b-eld that we discuss here already
appear in six dimensions, we will focus our attention to six-dimensional models in this
paper. moreover, as we will see, anomaly cancelations in six dimensions provide rather
stringent constraints on the consistencies of these models. in particular, we will show that the
multiplicity of 2b/2 in the 59 sector is crucial for the cancelation of the leading anomalies (i.e.,
the tr f 4 and tr r4 terms). moreover, the remaining anomalies are properly factorized which
can then be canceled by the green-schwarz mechanism. the analysis of four-dimensional
n = 1 orientifold models with background b-eld will appear in a separate publication [31].
this paper is organized as follows. in section ii, we describe in detail the construction
of some six-dimensional orientifold models with non-zero background b-eld considered in
ref. [17]. in section iii, we discuss anomaly cancelations in these models. we end with
some discussion in section iv. some of the technical details are relegated to the appendices.

ii. six dimensional examples

in this section, we discuss in detail the construction of six-dimensional type iib ori-
entifolds with background b-ux [17]. in particular, we consider the orbifold limits of k3:
t 4/zn where n = 2, 3, 4, 6.1 since we are interested in models with both d9 and d5-branes,
we only consider the cases n = 2, 4, 6. however, turning on the ns-ns antisymmetric two-

1these orientifolds without background b-ux have been constructed in [4,5].

form background seems to render the t 4/z6 type iib perturbative orientifold inconsistent2,
so we will concentrate on the z2 and z4 models. type i vacua on smooth k3 with non-zero
b-eld have been studied in [20].

toroidal compactication of type iib string theory on a four dimensional torus t 4 gives
rise to a six dimensional model with n = 4 supersymmetry. by gauging the world-sheet
parity  (xl  xr) of type iib strings reduces by half the number of supersymmetries.
one can further reduce the number of supersymmetries to n = 1 by orbifolding. specically,
the zn orbifold action is realized by powers of the twist generator  (n = 1) which can be
written in the form

 = exp(2i(v1j67 + v2j89)),

where jmn are so(4) cartan generators and v  (v1, v2) = 1
n (1,1) represents the twist.
in terms of the complex bosonic coordinates y1 = x6 + ix7, y2 = x8 + ix9 that parametrize
the torus,  acts diagonally as

kyi = e2ikviyi.

(2)

similarly, we dene complex fermionic elds i as 1 = 6 + i7 and 2 = 8 + i9.

to derive the massless spectra of the orientifolds, we will work in light-cone gauge. for
2|0i which are invariant

(4)

the close string spectrum is obtained by retaining only those states in the untwisted
sector which are invariant under the orientifold group action and by including twisted sector
states. this will be discussed in more detail in sec. ii b.

although type iib theory is a theory of closed strings, the orientifold projection requires
both closed and open string sectors for consistency. the klein bottle amplitude (which is
present due to the orientifold projection) in the closed string sector generically gives rise
to tadpole divergences. these divergences are canceled by the new contributions from the
open string sector [29]. alternatively, orientifold xed planes are sources for the ramond-
ramond (r-r) (p + 1)-forms. charge cancelation can be generically achieved by including

2t 4/z6 type iib orientifold with rank two b-ux does not contain states (4, 4; 1, 1) and (1, 1; 4, 4)
given in table ii of [17]. as a result, the tr r4 and tr f 4 anomalies do not cancel. however, it is
consistent [31] to turn on b-eld in the t 6/z6 orientifold in ref. [9] since the corresponding z3
twist is dierent.

the endpoints of an open string are labeled by a and b which lie on a dp and dq-brane
respectively (the corresponding excitations are pq sector states). the models we discuss
here have both d9 and d5-branes. the open string sector of the models will be discussed
in sec. ii a.

a. open string sector

the open string spectrum of type iib orientifolds on t 4/zn are determined by the
type and the number of d-branes necessary to cancel the tadpole divergences in the closed
string klein bottle amplitude. the worldsheet parity element  of the orientifold group
produces the tadpole which must be canceled by the 9-branes. for even n, the closed string
sector tadpole from n/2 orientifold element is canceled by introducing 5-branes, whose
worldvolume spans the uncompactied d = 6 space-time.

let  be a world-sheet excitation and a, b represent chan-paton indices associated with
the string endpoints on dp-brane and dq-brane (p, q = {5, 9}). these chan-paton indices
must be contracted with a hermitian matrix ab. the action of the group elements on the
open string state |, abi is given by [4]

k :
k :

|, abi  (k,p)aa|k., abi(k,q)1
bb ,
|, abi  (k,p)aa|k., bai(k,q)1

(5)

where k,p and k,p are unitary matrices associated with k. in order to be consistent with
group multiplication (5), we can choose

and

k,p = k,p  ,p,

k,p = k

1,p.

the absence of pure gauge twists requires 0,p = 1 [4]. because n = 1,

n
1,p = 1.

otherwise n,p would be a pure gauge twist. similarly, from (k)2 = 2k,

finally, using eqs. (6), (7), (9) and the unitarity of the  matrices we obtain

k,p = 2k,p t

k,p.


k,p =

(10)

since dierent types of branes are present it is also necessary to consider the action of (k)2
on pq states. in ref. [4], it was argued that 2 = 1 on 95 states. this implies that in
eq. (9) there are opposite signs for 9 and 5-branes. since a simultaneous t -duality on x6,7,8,9
interchanges 9 and 5- branes along with 0 and n/2,

the sign change in the  projection is due to the dd boundary conditions on the directions
transverse to the 5-branes.

finally, consider 59 open string states. for 5-branes, the compact coordinates obey mixed
dn boundary conditions and have expansions with half-integer modded creation operators.
by world-sheet supersymmetry their fermionic partners in the ns sector are integer modded.
their zero modes form a representation of a cliord algebra and can be labeled as |si, sji,
i, j = {2, 3}, with si, sj =  1
2 . the gso projection further imposes si = sj. since |si, sji
are invariant under , the orientifold projection on these states implies

notice that here the index a (b) lies on a 5-brane (9-brane).  relates 59 with 95 sectors
and does not impose extra constraints on .

the perturbative spectrum of type iib theory contains two massless antisymmetric
tensor elds: one coming from the ns-ns sector, and another coming from the r-r sector.
under the world-sheet parity reversal, the ns-ns two-form b is projected out, while the
r-r two-form b
 is kept. although the uctuations of bij (the components of b in
the compactied dimensions) are projected out of the perturbative unoriented closed string
spectrum, a quantized vacuum expectation value of bij is allowed. to see this, consider the
left- and right-moving momenta in the 4 dimensions compactied on a torus t 4:

pl,r =

ei
ri

(ni  bijmj) 

eimiri

(16)

where mi and ni are integers, ei are constant vielbeins such that ei  ej = gij is the constant
j. in (16)
background metric on t 4, ri are compactication radii of the t 4, and ei  ej = i
bij = bijrirj/. note that the components of bij are dened up to a shift bij  bij + 1
(which can be absorbed by redening ni). with this normalization, only the values bij = 0
and 1/2 are invariant under , and hence the vacuum expectation values of bij are quantized.
let b = rank(bij) (i, j  {6, 7, 8, 9}) be the rank of ns-ns antisymmetric tensor, it is clear
that b  2z.
the unitary matrices k,p and k,p must be chosen so that ns-ns tadpoles from the
mobius strip (ms) and the cylinder (c) of the open string sector cancel the ns-ns tadpole
of the closed string sector coming from the klein bottle (kb). the specic form of k,p and
k,p, and so the massless open string sector of the orientifold, is sensitive to the ns-ns
antisymmetric tensor background.

consider rst the case of zero b-ux, b = 0. the 1-loop vacuum amplitudes of the models
are given in appendix a. the t  0 divergences of the kb, c and ms (c.f., eqs.(a1),(a7)
and (a15)) produce tadpoles for the untwisted sector r-r 6- and 10-form as well as the
twisted sector r-r 6-form. relating the tree channel modulus  to the kb, ms and c loop

paton matrices to determine the open string spectrum of the model. alternatively, when the
 matrices are written in a cartan-weyl basis, the constraints on the chan paton matrices
become restrictions on the weight vectors. in this formalism [11], the 99-sector gauge bosons
correspond to both the cartan generators which trivially satisfy the (0) constraint, together
with charged generators belonging to a subset of so(32) root vectors selected by

a  v(99) = 0 mod z,
where v(99) is the shift vector of the gauge twist 1,9

and a = (1,1, 0,   , 0), a = 1,   , 480 are so(32) roots. (here, underlining indicates
in eq. (22) h is a vector of so(32) cartan
that all permutations must be considered).

(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3).

(23)

similarly, from the equation for (i) in (13) it follows that matter states correspond to
charged generators with

a  v(99) = vi mod z.

(24)

since 0,5 is antisymmetric,  projection in the 55-sector constraints gauge bosons to both
the cartan generators plus charged generators of sp(32) satisfying

a  v(55) = 0 mod z,

(25)

where a include all the so(32) roots plus long roots (2, 0,   , 0) and v(55) = v(99). matter
elds in the 55-sector correspond to charged generators with

a  v(55) = vi mod z.

(26)

note that only a subset of short roots is used in determining the matter content of the 55-
sector. this is due to the extra minus sign in (14) compare to the corresponding projection in
(13). finally, the 95 sector is handled using an auxiliary so(64)  so(32)(99)  so(32)(55)
algebra. since we have generators acting simultaneously on both 9-branes and 5-branes,
only roots of the form

w(95) = w(9)  w(5) = (1, 0,   , 0;1, 0,   , 0)

(27)

must be considered. here the rst (second) 16 components transform under so(32)(99)
(so(32)(55)). the shift in this sector is dened to be v95 = v(99)  v(55). from (15) we learn
that massless states correspond to w(95) roots satisfying

w(95)  v(95) = 0 mod z.

(28)

the open string spectrum of the t 4/zn orientifolds for b = 0 is included in table i. our
convention for the u(1) charges, as explained in appendix d, diers from that in [4,5].

consider now the tadpoles of t 4/zn orientifolds with non-zero b-ux, b 6= 0. tadpoles
with a volume factor v6vt 4, correspond to the untwisted r-r 10-form exchange in the closed
string tree channel. all three surfaces kb, ms and c contribute to the tadpole. the kb
contribution comes from the k = 0 untwisted closed string sector. since the parity projection
 in this sector requires all the windings to be zero, from (16) we conclude that the compact
momentum sum does not change, and the overall tadpole is the same as in the absence of
the bij:

(29)

the c contribution comes from the k = 0 99-string sector. the partition function in
this sector involves the summation over the 99-string momentum modes. upon poisson
resummation, which is necessary in order to extract the tadpole, the momentum sum in the
open string loop channel is reinterpreted as a sum over the closed string winding modes in the
tree channel. unlike the momentum states which remain unaected by the bij background,
only winding states with even winding numbers are allowed along the compact directions
with bij 6= 0. indeed, closed string winding states satisfy

which with the quantization (16) and for a generic choice of metric on t 4 implies

pl = pr,

ni  bijmj = 0.

(30)

(31)

eq. (31) requires mj  2z for compact directions j such that bij 6= 0. even winding numbers
in the closed tree channel further imply an eective reduction by half the basis momentum
lattice vectors along these directions compare to the b = 0 case [15,16]. in the nontrivial bij

alternatively, the 2b factor of the c tadpole can be interpreted as a sum over 2b dierent
sub-lattices within the b = 0 case unit volume, shifted with respect to each other by half the
generating vectors. a priori, the ms tadpole can have a dierent  projection 0,9 = t
0,9,
depending on a specic sub-lattice. in fact, the tadpole factorization requires that the ms
contribution increases by 2b/2, which is achieved by choosing the same  projection for
(2b1 + 2b/21) sub-lattices and the opposite projection for the other (2b1  2b/21) sub-

tadpoles with a volume factor v6/vt4 represent the untwisted r-r 6-form exchange in the
closed string tree channel. the kb contribution comes from the k = n/2 untwisted closed
string sector. in this sector the parity projection requires all the momenta to be zero and
the ns-ns background allows only even windings along the compact directions with bij 6= 0.

since k6form
tadpole measures the square of the total r-r charge of the sixteen orientifold 5-
planes, its reduction compare to the zero ns-ns background tadpole implies that 24b(2b1+
2b/21) o5-planes have the same charge as in the b = 0 case while the other 24b(2b12b/21)
o5-planes turn into o5-planes which carry r-r charge opposite to that of the o5-plane [16].
the c contribution comes from the k = 0 55-string sector. here, the partition function
sums over the 55-string winding modes. the 55-string winding modes in the open string

the ms amplitude relevant to the 6-form exchange in the tree channel is interpreted as a
closed string exchange between 5-branes and sixteen orientifold 5-planes, and so is propor-
tional to the total r-r charge of the orientifold 5-planes. it is suggested by (35) that the
absolute value of the r-r charge of the orientifold 5-planes is reduced by 2b/2, so

since traces of 0,p count the number of d-branes, (39) implies the rank reduction of a gauge
group in the open string sector when the b-ux is turned on [1517].

in addition to the untwisted r-r 6- and 10-form tadpoles  which are canceled as dis-
cussed above, the orientifolds of interest have potential tadpoles corresponding to the twisted
sector r-r 6-form exchange in the tree channel. these tadpoles come from the cylinder vac-
uum amplitudes cpq, p, q = {5, 9}, (a7) with k 6= 0 and so do not get contributions from
momentum and winding modes on t 4. since the nonzero ns-ns tensor background eects
only the quantization of the momentum and winding modes on t 4, one would expect the
twisted r-r 6-form tadpole to be the same as in the b = 0 case. as we will discuss in detail
in sec. iii, anomaly cancelations in six dimensions requires the 2b/2 multiplicity of mass-
less states in the 59 open string sector. in type iib orientifolds, gauge degrees of freedom
are carried by the chan-paton indices, so the multiplicity of massless states is extended to
the multiplicity of chan-paton indices in the 59-sector and thus the multiplicity of massive
states in this sector as well. the latter implies that the cylinder vacuum amplitudes c99,
c55 are unaected by the b-ux while c95 and c59 get an extra factor of 2b/2. this raises
a question: once the relative factor of c99 and c95 vacuum amplitudes is changed in the
nonzero ns-ns background, how one maintains the factorization of the twisted r-r 6-form
tadpoles? recall that going to the tree channel interpretation in the kb vacuum amplitude
we related (for b = 0) the tree channel modulus  and the loop channel modulus tk through
 = 1/(4tk). this kb tree channel cylinder has length  and two crosscaps. the c and
ms vacuum amplitudes of the open string sector in the tree channel picture were represented
by an identical length cylinder and a cylinder with a crosscap. the fact that we used the
same tree channel modulus for c and ms implicitly assumed the ability to relate kb, c and
ms amplitudes to each other by adding/removing crosscaps. this is possible only for c99
and c55 since only they have the same type boundaries, which allows putting the crosscaps.
the above arguments do not x the relation between  and tc59. we claim that this relation
must be xed by demanding anomaly cancelation along with factorization of twisted r-r
6-form tadpoles. thus we require

given (43) and (45), the massless open string states can be determined as in the b = 0 case.
the open string spectra are given in table i.

b. closed string sector

in this section we discuss the closed string sector of type iib orientifolds on t 4/zn ,

(n = 2, 4), in the presence of b-ux.

first consider the z2 orientifold models. the untwisted sector of the models is con-
structed by keeping states of type iib orbifold on t 4/z2 invariant under the world sheet
parity . this gives rise to a n = 1 supergravity multiplet in six dimensions, accompanied
by one tensor multiplet and four hypermultiplets.
the twisted sectors will produce additional multiplets. the bosonic content of a hy-
permultiplet is four scalars transforming as 4(1, 1) under the six dimensional little group
so(4)  su(2) su(2), while that of a tensor multiplet as (1, 1) (1, 3). there are overall
16 xed points in the z2 orbifold with an orientifold 5-plane sitting at each xed point. as
we explained in sec. ii a, out of 16 orientifold 5-planes, each one of 24b  (2b1 + 2b/21)
o5-planes carries (2) units of r-r charge while the other 24b  (2b1  2b/21) o5-planes
have opposite r-r charge. this implies that precisely 24b  (2b1 + 2b/21) z2 xed points
are even under the  projection while the other 24b  (2b1  2b/21) z2 xed points pick up
a minus sign under the  projection. at each xed point of the twisted sector, the ns and
r sector massless states transform as

sector
ns
r

su(2)  su(2) rep.

2(1, 1) ,
(1, 2) .

(46)

the twisted sector spectrum is obtained by taking products of states from the left- and right-
moving sectors. the orientifold projection  keeps symmetric (antisymmetric) combinations
in the ns-ns sector and antisymmetric (symmetric) combinations in the r-r sector for each
-even (-odd) z2 xed point. this gives the bosonic content of a hypermultiplet for each
-even z2 xed point and the bosonic content of a tensor multiplet for each -odd z2
xed point. overall, the twisted sectors of z2 orientifold contribute 24b  (2b1 + 2b/21)
hypermultiplets and 24b  (2b1  2b/21) extra tensor multiplet (see table i).
the untwisted sector of t 4/z4 orientifold contains n = 1 supergravity multiplet in six
dimensions, accompanied by one tensor multiplet and two hypermultiplets.

12

the four z4 invariant xed points of t 4/z4 orientifold give four hypermultiplets and four
tensor multiplet. they are also z2 xed points and so supply an additional 4 hypermultiplets.
the other 12 z2 xed points form 6 z4 invariant pairs. out of 12 z2 xed points which
are not z4 invariant, 24b  (2b1  2b/21) xed points are odd under the  projection and
the other 12  24b  (2b1  2b/21) are even. thus they contribute 23b  (2b1  2b/21)
extra tensor multiplets and 6  23b  (2b1  2b/21) hypermultiplets. overall, twisted
sectors of z4 orientifold contribute 4 + 23b  (2b1  2b/21) extra tensor multiplets and
14  23b  (2b1  2b/21) hypermultiplets (see table i).

iii. anomaly cancelations

2, 1

an important check on the consistency of the n = 1 six dimensional vacua constructed
in the previous sections is provided by the cancelation of all gauge, gravitational, and mixed
anomalies. cancelation of tadpoles in type iib orientifolds on t 4/zn (n = 2, 4) discussed
in sec. ii a guarantees 1-loop consistency of the equations of motion for the untwisted r-r
6- and 10-form as well as the twisted r-r 6-form. recall that the tadpoles were extracted
from the kb, ms and c vacuum amplitudes. each of these amplitudes involves a summation
over four spin structures (i.e., summation over {, } = {0, 1
2} in appendix a). actually,
the r-r spin structure, {, } = { 1
2} in appendix a, does not contribute to the 1-
loop vacuum amplitudes because of the fermionic zero modes. on the other hand, it will
contribute to the 2-loop vacuum amplitudes, as well as to various scattering processes. in
fact, being odd under the spacetime parity, it is the only spin structure (at 1-loop level)
that would generate potential chiral anomalies in the low-energy eective eld theory. in
this sense, the cancelation of six dimensional chiral anomalies follows from the absence of
tadpoles coming from the r-r spin structure. in this section we show that t 4/zn (n = 2, 4)
type iib orientifolds with b-ux are free from chiral anomalies. first, we explain anomaly
cancelation in the framework of the six dimensional eective eld theory. then we discuss
how the green-schwarz terms can be computed from the corresponding non-planar diagrams
in the latter approach we conrm the necessity of 2b/2 multiplicity of
in string theory.
59-cylinder diagrams. some useful facts on six dimensional chiral anomalies are given in
appendix c.

a. z2 orientifolds

we start with the t 4/z2 orientifold models. from the spectrum of the models given
in table i it is straightforward to check using the results of appendix c that the leading
anomalies, i.e., the tr r4 and tr f 4 terms vanish. to see this explicitly, notice that the
leading term in the pure gravitational anomalies is proportional to

(nh  nv + 29nt  273) tr r4,

(47)

where nh is the number of hypermultiplets from both open and closed string sectors. from
section ii b, nt  1 = 8  8/2b/2 and the number of closed string hypermultiplets is nc
h =
12 + 8/2b/2. the gauge group is u(n)  u(n) where n = 16/2b/2, and hence nv = 2n 2.
the number of open string hypermultiplets is no
it is easy to

h = 2n(n  1) + 2b/2n 2.

13

see that the above term (47) vanishes. notice that it is crucial for the cancelation of the
tr r4 gravitational anomaly that the multiplicity of 59-open string matter states is 2b/2.
in addition, the hypermultiplet representations plus the 2b/2 multiplicity in the 59-sector
ensure that the tr f 4 term is absent. this can be seen from (c5) that the leading pure
gauge non-abelian anomalies for each su(n) gauge group is proportional to

(2n  2(n  8)  2b/2n) tr f 4

(48)

which vanishes since the multiplicity of 59 states is 2b/2 which is equal to 16/n. the
remaining gravitational + gauge anomaly may be written in the form

(51)

the subscript a = 5, 9 refers to the gauge group factors in the 55- and 99-open string
sectors4. the anomaly polynomial (49) contains terms that involve only nonabelian eld
strength as well as terms that also involve abelian eld strength. the former can be canceled
by exchange of a two-form, which involves green-schwarz interactions of the form

(52)

the b2 eld is the 2-form with gauge invariant eld strength h = db2  x (9)

3 . the counterterm (52) arises from the tree-level diagram which involves coupling of
the b2 eld and a pair of gauge bosons. such couplings can be computed from the disk
diagram in string theory. when b 6= 0, a disk diagram involving two gauge bosons and
a two-form potential of the twisted sector tensor multiplet is proportional to tr (1,p(p)2),
where p = 5, 9 refers to the 55- or 99-open string sector and p denotes the chan-paton
generator of the corresponding gauge boson. using the results in appendix d, this trace
is zero. thus we identify the 2-form b2 as a combination of the two-form potential of the

4the anomalies of the b = 0 models were discussed previously in [13]. the dierence between the
corresponding anomaly polynomials of (51) and the one given in [13] is due to a dierent convention

self-dual eld strength of the untwisted sector tensor multiplet. the remaining terms of the

under the u(1)a gauge transformations aa  aa + da. as in (52), the counterterm (53)
arises from a tree-level diagram. this diagram involves the coupling of the b(a)
scalars with
0
a single u(1)a gauge boson. from the disk diagram, the coupling of the untwisted sector r-r
scalars to u(1)a gauge boson is proportional to tr (a) which vanishes, see appendix d. on
the other hand, the corresponding coupling of the twisted sector r-r scalars is proportional
to tr 1,aa 6= 0.
consider rst the b = 0 case. the number of z2 twisted scalars i is 16. all of them
couple with the same relative strength to the 99-sector u(1), because tr (1,99) (which
measures the coupling strength) is the same for all xed points. since all d5-branes sit at
the origin, only the twisted scalar at the origin (which we denote by 1) will couple. this
can be seen explicitly from the tadpole solution: the coupling of the scalar at a xed point
i to a 55-sector gauge boson is proportional to tr (1,5,i5), which is zero unless i = 1 is the
origin, where all the d5-branes are located. therefore,

(56)

for some coecients a1 and a2 to be determined. the other scalars i, i = 2,   16, couple
only to the 99-sector, but all in a same way, so

requiring that (55)-(57) generate (54) uniquely xes all the coecients: , , a1, a2, b1 up

(58)

(59)

since the is are in linear multiplets, the choice of normalization  is irrelevant. the choice
 = 1/4 reproduces the result of [13]. one can always attain the canonical normalization of
b(9)
0 with an appropriate change of the coupling constants in the counterterm (53).
this is also generic to other orientifold models: a linear combination of twisted scalars that
couple to the abelian gauge elds is unique, up to eld normalization.

0 and b(5)

in the b = 2 case, the number of z2 twisted scalars is 12. as in the previous case, one
scalar is singled out as living at the xed point where we put all d5-branes. using the same
logic as before, we nd a unique solution

we now consider t 4/z4 orientifold models. from the open string spectrum of the models
given in table i and the closed string spectrum in section ii b, one can easily see that
the tr r4 and all tr f 4 terms vanish in the 8-form anomaly polynomial. the remaining

in the z4 orientifolds there are two nonabelian gauge factors in the 99-sector and 55-sector.
one comes from the shift-vector 1/8 components and the other come from the shift-vector
3/8 components, (c.f. (44)). in (64), we use this to label dierent gauge factors. for example,
the 99-sector nonabelian eld strengths will be denoted by f1,9 and f3,9. the nonabelian
factors in the 55-sector are denoted by f1,5 and f3,5. we use similar notation f,a for the
abelian factors. the terms of the anomaly polynomial (64) that involve only nonabelian eld
strengths can be canceled by exchange of three two-forms with green-schwarz interactions

the counterterm (67) arises from a tree-level diagram which involves coupling of b(i)
2 elds
and a pair of gauge bosons. recall that these models have a single tensor multiplet from
the untwisted sector, 4 tensor multiplets from the z4 twisted sector and 23b  (2b1  2b/21)
extra tensor multiplets coming from the z2 twisted sector. by the same arguments as for the
t 4/z2 orientifolds, the z2 twisted sector tensor multiplets do not couple to a pair of gauge
bosons. on the contrary, the coupling of the z4 twisted sector tensor multiplets from the
disk diagram is nonzero. with all the d5-branes at the origin, only the z4 twisted tensor
multiplet at the origin will couple to the 55-sector gauge bosons. thus we expect that b(1)
2
and b(3)
are combinations of the untwisted sector two-form potentials of the gravity and
2
the tensor multiplets plus two-form potentials of all four z4 twisted sector tensor multiplets.
b(2)
2 must contain the untwisted sector two-form potentials and a two-form potential from

the z4 twisted sector tensor multiplet at the origin. the remaining abelian terms of the

under the u(1) gauge transformations a,a  a,a + d,a.
notice that in the presence of d-branes, the total twist of a non-vanishing n-point
function does not have to be zero. therefore, the anomalous u(1) gauge bosons can couple
to closed string states from dierent twisted sectors (in this case z2 and z4 twisted sectors).
as a result, there are mixings in the kinetic terms of the z2 and z4 twisted sector states
even when gs = 0. we now proceed to identify the scalars b(,a)
in terms of the twisted r-r
states.

0

we start with the b = 0 case. there are in total 14 twisted scalars: 4 scalars (we denote
them by (4)
, i = 1,   4) coming from the z4 twisted sector, the other 10 scalars (we denote
i
them (2)
j , j = 1,   10) coming from the z2 twisted sector. out of 10 z2 twisted elds, 4
come from the z2 xed points which are also z4 xed points, and the other 6 come from 6
pairs of the z2 xed points which are z4 invariant. let us analyze the coupling of these r-r
twisted elds to the various u(1) gauge bosons. all twisted elds couple to the 99-sector
vector bosons. these couplings can be computed from the disk diagram: for the z4 twisted
elds the coupling is proportional to tr (1,9,9) while for the z2 twisted elds the coupling
is proportional to tr (2,9,9). since

tr (1,91,9)
tr (1,93,9)
tr (2,91,9)
tr (2,93,9)

= 1,

= 1,

(71)

the coupling of (4)
to the a3,9 abelian gauge boson is identical to that of the a1,9, while the
i
coupling of (2)
to a3,9 is opposite to its coupling to a1,9. as in the case of z2 orientifold,
j
only twisted elds that live at the xed point where the d5-branes are located will couple
to the 55-sector gauge bosons. we call these elds (4)
1 . their coupling to dierent
u(1) can be deduced as discussed above. collecting the information about the coupling, we

c. green-schwarz terms from non-planar diagrams

in the eld theory framework the cancelation procedure of the six dimensional chiral
anomalies involves one-loop and tree-level diagrams. the former generates the anomaly
polynomial, while the latter cancels it through the generalized green-schwarz mechanism.
this cancelation has a simple interpretation from the string theory point of view. con-
sider 1-loop open string diagrams whose low-energy limit reproduces the 1-loop eld theory
anomalies. the factorized form of the anomaly polynomial comes from the appropriate
non-planar diagrams in string theory. let t denotes the standard 1-loop cylinder modulus,
the eld theory result comes from the t  + boundary of the moduli space. since the
non-planar diagrams are nite [23], they can not generate chiral anomalies: the anomalous
contribution of the 1-loop amplitude from the large t region of the moduli space is canceled
exactly by the contribution from the small t region. through the conformal transformation

20

t  1/, the t  0 region of the 1-loop open string amplitude is interpreted as   
limit of a tree-level closed string exchange between two boundary states. this is precisely
the string theory picture of the green-schwarz mechanism. in the rest of this section, we
identify the string diagrams whose t   limit produces purely gauge anomalies of the
t 4/z2 orientifold models. for illustrative purposes, we consider terms of the anomaly poly-
nomial (49) in the z2 models which are sensitive to the 2b/2 multiplicity of states in the
59-open string sector. the analysis for the other terms in (49) as well as that for the t 4/z4
orientifold models is similar and so will not be repeated here.

from the anomaly polynomial (49), the ratio of the coecients of f9  f 3
we start with the f9  f 3

terms is (4/2b/2). this is the result we want to conrm by a string computation.
this term is shown on fig. 1. this amplitude is given by

iv. discussion

in this paper we have considered type iib orientifolds on t 4/zn (n = 2, 4) with discrete
b-ux, previously constructed in [17]. we have analyzed the gravitational, gauge and mixed
anomalies of the resulting six dimensional vacua and showed that they all cancel. the
cancelation required the 2b/2 multiplicity of states in the 59-open string sector. in a eld
theory framework, we have identied the twisted sector r-r scalars and tensor multiplets
involved in the green-schwarz mechanism responsible for this cancelation.

we presented details of the construction of these models and argued that consistency
with 2b/2 multiplicity of 59-sector states requires a modication of the relation between the
open string 1-loop channel modulus and the closed string tree channel modulus for the 59-
(95-) cylinder amplitudes. the latter should not be surprising, since only for cylinders with
the same boundary conditions ( 99- or 55-cylinders) can one relate their loop moduli to the
loop moduli of the klein bottle and the mobius strip by adding/removing crosscaps.
in
fact, we argued that it is precisely the anomaly cancelation condition that should be used to
determine the relation between the 59-cylinder 1-loop and tree channel modulus. the reason
is that chiral anomalies are sensitive to the r-r spin structure of 1-loop amplitudes, however
this spin structure does not contribute to the 1-loop tadpoles. on the other hand, the r-r

22

spin structure will contribute to 2-loop tadpoles, and hence the cancelation of anomalies
probes the 2-loop tadpole consistency of the models.

we showed that the anomaly polynomial computed in eld theory can be extracted from
an appropriate limit of non-planar cylinder amplitudes. we identied certain 1-loop non-
planar diagrams which are sensitive to the 2b/2 multiplicity of 59-sector states and showed
that they correctly reproduce the eld theory result, when the multiplicity of 59-cylinders
is taken to be 2b/2 as required from the cancelation of the tadpoles.

our results here can be extended to four dimensional orientifolds [31]. in [9] a t 6/z6
orientifold with b = 2 b-ux was proposed as an explicit string realization of the brane
world scenario. the model constructed there contains three chiral families and a pati-salam
su(4)su(2)lsu(2)r gauge group. the fact that there are three chiral families depends
crucially on the 2b/2 multiplicity of states in the 59-open string sector. in four dimensions,
anomaly constraints are much weaker and so are not stringent enough to determine the
doubling of the 59-sector states [31]. however, by compactifying the b = 2 t 4/z2 orientifold
considered in this paper on an extra t 2 and further orbifolding it by z3, we obtain the t 6/z6
orientifold. before the z3 orbifold projection, there is doubling of states in the 59 sector of
the orientifold since it is connected to the six-dimensional z2 orientifold discussed in this
paper by decompactifying the t 2 6. this doublet of states can only transform as a singlet
representation under z3. thus either all the 59-states of t 6/z6 orientifolds are projected
out, or all of them are kept. since tadpole cancelation requires the presence of 59 open
string sector states [9,31], this implies that the 59 sector states come with a multiplicity of
2.

the presence of the ns-ns sector b-eld background is rather generic. for example,
when one considers orientifolding an asymmetric orbifold [18], the background b-eld is
generically non-zero. the fact that that bij dened in eq.(16) is invariant under bij  bij + 1
and that it takes only quantized values of 0 or 1/2 suggests that it should be possible to
indeed, one also nds a 2b/2 multiplicity of states in the

appendix a: one-loop vacuum amplitudes in orientifolds

without ns-ns antisymmetric tensor background.

in this section we review the computation of 1-loop vacuum amplitudes of the t 4/zn
orientifolds [4,5]. the 1-loop vacuum amplitudes come from the klein bottle k, mobius
strip m, and cylinder c.

the klein bottle amplitude is given by

(a2)

the contribution of the uncompactied momenta is already extracted in (a1). here, v6
denotes the regularized space-time volume. since  exchanges n with n n, only n = 0
and n = n/2 terms survive the trace. the trace in zk can be evaluated in a standard way
using  functions to write the contributions of complex bosons and fermions. also, the gso
projection is implemented by summing over spin structures. then, taking into account the
insertion of  we nd

in eq. (a5), (n/2, k) is a factor that takes into account the xed point degeneracy [30],
i.e., it counts the number of xed points of n/2 on t 4 invariant under k:

(n/2, k) = 16,
(2, k) = 4,

k = {0, n/2},
k = {1, 3}, and n = 4.

(a6)

as (a3), (a5) vanishes by virtue of supersymmetry. the ns-ns exchange in the closed
string tree channel is represented by {, } = {0, 0} and {, } = { 1

in six dimensions chiral anomalies are characterized by an 8-form polynomial constructed
from the gauge and gravitational eld strengths. the basic diagram to be examined is the
box diagram with an even number of external gravitons and gauge elds. the resulting
anomalous diagrams can be classied as purely gravitational, purely gauge or mixed gauge
and gravitational.

all four n = 1 supergravity multiplets contribute to purely gravitational anomaly. their

separate contributions to the anomaly polynomial are given by

aab is the

in (c4) we included only hypermultiplet representations which are relevant to the orientifold
models of interest (see table i for the hypermultiplet spectrum).

it is convenient to express all traces over nonabelian eld strengths in the fundamental
representation of respective gauge groups. here we list out the relations between traces in
dierent representations for su(n) groups [26] (since they are the nonabelian gauge groups
arise in the type iib orientifolds of interest in this paper). for n  3,

tr f 4 = 2n tr f 4 + 6 (tr f 2)2,
tr aij f 4 = (n  8) tr f 4 + 3 (tr f 2)2,
tr aij f 3 = (n  4) tr f 3,
tr f 2 = 2n tr f 2,
tr aij f 2 = (n  2) tr f 2,

(c5)

where aij denotes a second rank antisymmetric tensor representation. tr refers to the trace
in the fundamental representation. furthermore, for su(2):

tr f 4 =

(tr f 2)2.

appendix d: traces over gauge group generators.

in sec. ii a we discuss how the shift vector formalism of [11] can be used to represent
gauge twists 1,a and determine massless states in the open string sector of the type iib
orientifold models. here, we collect the formulas relevant to the computation of traces for
the anomaly cancelation.

in sec. ii a we rewrite the chan-paton matrices p

a in a cartan-weyl basis. the
subscript a refers to the nonabelian gauge group factor ga in the p = 5, 9 open string sector,
while a labels the generator of u(1)a in open string sector p. the cartan generators are
represented by tensor product of 2  2 3 submatricies. we chose the normalization of the
so(32) generators  in such a way that tr 2 = 1. in all the models we discuss, there is a
u(1) factor for each of the su(n)s in the model. the generator p
a of a given u(1)a is given
by a linear combination

a and p
