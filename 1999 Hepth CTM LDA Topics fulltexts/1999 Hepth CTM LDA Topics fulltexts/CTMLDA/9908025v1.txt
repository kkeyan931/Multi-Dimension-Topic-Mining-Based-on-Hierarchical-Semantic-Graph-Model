abstract
various structural properties of the space of symmetry breaking boundary condi-
tions that preserve an orbifold subalgebra are established. to each such boundary
condition we associate its automorphism type. we show that correlation functions in
the presence of such boundary conditions are expressible in terms of twisted bound-
ary blocks which obey twisted ward identities. the subset of boundary conditions
that share the same automorphism type is controlled by a classifying algebra, whose
structure constants are shown to be traces on spaces of chiral blocks. t-duality on
boundary conditions is not a one-to-one map in general.
these structures are illustrated in a number of examples. several applications,
including the construction of non-bps boundary conditions in string theory, are
exhibited.

introduction

the study of conformally invariant boundary conditions in two-dimensional conformal eld
theory is of considerable interest both for applications in condensed matter physics and in
string theory. in such applications typically only the (super-)conformal symmetry needs to be
preserved by the boundaries, while the rest of the chiral bulk symmetries a may be broken.

in [1] we have studied conformally invariant boundary conditions for an arbitrary conformal

eld theory that preserve a (consistent) subalgebra a of a, such that

a = ag

is the subalgebra that is xed under a nite abelian group g of automorphisms of a. we have
shown that such boundary conditions are governed by a classifying algebra c( a), in the sense
that the reection coecients [2, 3]  the data that characterize the boundary condition  are
precisely the one-dimensional irreducible representations of c( a).
this paper is a continuation to [1]. our numbering of sections will be consecutive, i.e. by
sections 1 to 6 we refer to those of the preceding paper, while here we will start with section
7; accordingly equation numbers with section label  6 refer to formulas in [1]. 1 a very brief
summary of the pertinent results of [1] is as follows. the algebra c( a) is a commutative
associative semisimple algebra. thus its regular representation is fully reducible, and the
structure constants are expressible through the corresponding diagonalizing matrix s by an
analogue of the verlinde formula. this matrix s, in turn, can be expressed in terms of various
quantities that are already known from the chiral conformal eld theory associated to a (see
formula (5.9)a).

the conformal eld theory with chiral algebra a can be obtained from the a-theory as an
orbifold by the group g; conversely, the original a-theory is recovered from the a-theory as an
integer spin simple current extension, with the group g of simple currents being the character
group of the orbifold group, g = g. denoting the labels for the primary elds of the a-theory
by  and those for the primary a-elds by , a natural basis of c( a) is labelled by pairs (, ),
where  refers to a a-primary in the untwisted sector and s is a group character, while
the boundary conditions are labelled by pairs [, ] consisting of an arbitrary primary label 
of the a-theory and a character  u. here the stabilizer s and the untwisted stabilizer u
are subgroups of the simple current group g = g; s consists of all simple currents in g that
leave  xed, and u is the subgroup of s on which a certain alternating bi-homomorphism f,
which can be dened through the modular properties of one-point chiral blocks on the torus,
is trivial. for the precise meaning of these terms we refer to [1] (in particular appendix a)
and to [4]. quite generally, the number of basis elements of c( a)  or equivalently, the number
of independent boundary blocks, i.e. chiral blocks for one-point correlation functions of bulk
elds on the disk  and the number of boundary conditions have to be equal. it is a rather
non-trivial result of the analysis that this equality indeed holds for the two sets of labels, so
that in particular the matrix s  s(,),[, ] is a square matrix.
the results established in [1] clearly demonstrate an unexpectedly nice behavior of the
space of conformally invariant boundary conditions. in the present paper we show that indeed

1 a few of those formulas are, however, reproduced in the appendix of the present paper. this is indicated

by an additional subscript a of the equation number.

2

this space is endowed with even more structure. the following section 7 deals with the im-
plementation of the orbifold group on the representation spaces of the chiral algebra a; this
discussion does not yet involve boundary conditions at all, but the results will be needed in
the sequel. sections 8  13 are devoted to the discussion of several additional generic features
of symmetry breaking boundary conditions. we start in section 8 by analyzing the notion of
automorphism type, which in the present setting is a derived concept that arises as a direct
consequence of the general structure and does not need be introduced by hand. next we show
that boundary conditions of denite automorphism type can be naturally formulated with the
help of twisted boundary blocks, which satisfy twisted ward identities (section 9). furthermore,
to the boundary conditions of xed automorphism type one can associate their own classify-
ing algebra, which is an invariant subalgebra of the total classifying algebra c( a) and whose
structure constants can be understood in terms of suitable traces on chiral blocks; this is done
in section 10. it is also shown that the individual classifying algebra for automorphism type g
only depends on the automorphism g, but not on the specic orbifold subalgebra a, i.e. not on
the group g containing g.

afterwards, in section 11, we turn to a detailed study of the dependence of the classify-
ing algebra on the chosen torus partition function, which leads to the concept of t-duality of
boundary conditions. first we show that only the dierence between an automorphism char-
acterizing the torus partition function and the automorphism type of a boundary condition is
observable, and then we discuss aspects of t-duality among (families of) boundary conditions
for xed choice of the torus partition function. we emphasize that t-duality on boundary con-
ditions is not a one-to-one map, in general. in section 12 we establish an action of the orbifold
group g on the space of boundary conditions, which implies a certain homogeneity among the
boundary conditions for xed g-orbit []. finally we introduce in section 13 the concept of a
universal classifying algebra, which governs all conformally invariant boundary conditions at
the same time, and discuss the possibility to obtain this algebra by a suitable projective limit.
in sections 14 and 15 we turn our attention to a specic class of boundary conditions to
which we refer as involutary, namely those where the orbifold group is z2. we rst address
some general features and then, in section 15, analyze several classes of examples that are of
particular interest. afterwards, in section 16 we provide several classes of examples with more
complicated orbifold groups, in which for instance untwisted stabilizer subgroups occur that
are proper subgroups of the full stabilizers. finally, some of the pertinent formulae from [1]
that will be needed in the sequel are collected in appendix a.

7 the action of the orbifold group on a-modules

the elements g of the orbifold group g are automorphisms of the chiral algebra a.
in the
sequel we will have to deal with various subgroups of g and their properties. we rst observe
that every automorphism g of a can be implemented on the physical a-modules h by maps
(7.1)

: h  hg ,

g  ()

g

which obey the g-twisted intertwining property

g y = g(y ) g

for all y  a ,

(7.2)

3

and the maps g are dened by this property up to a scalar multiple. (for a concrete realization
of these maps in wzw theories, see [5].) in general, such an implementation ()
g maps a given
space h to some other a-module hg, thereby organizing the primary elds of the a-theory
into orbits, much like the simple current group g = g organizes [6] the a-primaries into orbits.

to every a-primary  we can associate the stabilizer

s := {g  g| g = } ,

(7.3)

which is a subgroup of g whose elements constitute endomorphisms h  h. stabilizers of
a-primaries on the same g-orbit are identical (in the more general case of non-abelian g, they
are conjugate subgroups); the vacuum has a maximal stabilizer, s = g. also, a-modules on
the same g-orbit are isomorphic as a-modules. the endomorphisms g for g  s provide us
with an action of s on h which is, in general, only projective, and hence determines a two-
cocycle e of s or, more precisely (in agreement with the fact that the maps g are dened
only up to normalization), the cohomology class of e. we denote by u the subgroup of s
that corresponds to the regular elements of the associated twisted group algebra ces, i.e.

u := {g  s | e(g, g) =e(g, g) for all g  s} .

(7.4)

the scalar factors in the denition of the implementers g can be chosen in such a way that
the maps g with g  u provide us with a honest representation of u on h. it follows that
the a-modules h can be decomposed as

h = mju 



vj  h,j ,

(7.5)

where the spaces vj are projective s-modules and the spaces h,j are a-modules. we make
the mild technical assumption that all these modules vj and h,j are irreducible; this holds
true in all known examples, and is rigorously proven for the vacuum  [7, 8] as well as [9] for
other a-modules, including twisted sectors. in the case of the vacuum, no multiplicities appear
in this decomposition; thus the action of g is genuine and we have u = s = g.

since by construction g leaves the subalgebra a of a xed, the maps g are ordinary
intertwiners for a; hence in the decomposition (7.5) they act solely on the degeneracy space vj.
moreover, by the general properties of twisted group algebras (compare appendix b of [1]), all

the spaces vj have the same dimensionp|s|/|u|, and the basis of the twisted group algebra

ces can be chosen in such a way that every g  u is implemented as a diagonal matrix acting
on vj.
the result (7.5) should be compared to the similar decomposition (3.9) that arises from the

simple current point of view, i.e.

h  h[, ] = mjg/s

v   hj .

(7.6)

here the spaces v  are projective s-modules, with corresponding cocycle f of s, while the
spaces hj are a-modules; by assumption, the latter modules are irreducible (this assumption
is indeed satised for all cases we know of). simple current theory [10, 11, 6, 4] shows that in

4

the decomposition (7.6) isomorphic a-modules appear precisely as a consequence of xed point
resolution; therefore the multiplicity of hj in this decomposition is given by |u|. on the
other hand, as seen above, elements of the orbifold group g that are not in the stabilizer s
relate isomorphic a-modules. thus we can identify the groups u and g/s. to make this
manifest, we dualize the exact sequence 0  u  g and complete it to an exact sequence

0  s  g = g  u  0 .

(7.7)
conversely, in the decomposition of a a-module h there appear |u| many irreducible a-
modules. in simple current language, the number of irreducibles is just the length of the orbit,
and hence again we can dualize 0  u  g and complete it to
0  s  g = g  u  0 .

(7.8)

as a consequence, the cardinalities of the respective subgroups of g and g are related by

|s| |u| = |g| = |g| = |s| |u| ,

(7.9)

and hence in particular the dimensions of the degeneracy spaces in the decompositions (7.5)
and (7.6) coincide:

(dimv )2 = |s| /|u| = |s| /|u| = (dim vj)2 .

we abbreviate these dimensions by

d := dimv  = dim vj .

(7.10)

(7.11)

there is also a manifest relationship between the groups s and g/u. first we realize that
the implementation of g on the whole g-orbit of  provides us with a two-cocycle of g with
values in u(1) whose restriction to s  s coincides with e; we again denote this cocycle by
the symbol e. given such a cocycle, its commutator cocycle e, which is dened by

e(g, g) := e(g, g)/e(g, g)

(7.12)

for all g, g  g, constitutes [1] a bi-homomorphism on g g which is alternating in the sense
that e(g, g) = e(g, g). now let us characterize for every js an element hj of g by the
property that
(7.13)

e(hj, g) = j(g)

for all g  g ;

such a group element hj exists because, owing to the exactness of the sequence (7.8), for every
js we have j(g) = 1 for all g  u, and (7.13) characterizes hj uniquely up to an element of
u. furthermore, as a consequence of the character property of e in the rst argument, we
have

for all g  g, which tells us that hjhj = hjj modulo u. it follows that the mapping

e(hjj, g) = e(hjhj, g)

j  hj u

5

(7.14)

(7.15)

constitutes an isomorphism between s and g/u. it is worth noting that this isomorphism
is logically independent from the isomorphism between g/s and u that exists according to
the sequence (7.8).
again this result has an obvious dual analogue. to work this out we recall from appendix
a of [1] that the commutator cocycle f of f, dened by f(j, l) =f(j, l)/f(l, j) for
j, ls, possesses a natural extension. f is an alternating bi-homomorphism on s s,
while its extension is a bi-homomorphism on g s; by imposing the alternating property it
can be further extended to a bi-homomorphism on g g, still to be denoted by f. by the
character property of f in the second argument, we can then associate to every g  s an
element kg  k()

of g by stipulating that

g

f(kg, l) = g(l)

for all lg ,

(7.16)

which determines kg uniquely up to elements of u. the character property of f in the rst
argument implies
(7.17)

f(kgg, l) = f(kgkg, l) ,

so that kgkg = kgg modulo u. thus the map

g  kg u

(7.18)

between s and g/u is an isomorphism.
for later reference we also mention another isomorphism that is similar to (7.18). namely,
we now consider a character g of s rather than a character g of g. then the requirement that
(7.19)

f( kg, l) = g(l)

for all ls

determines kg s uniquely modulo u, and

g  kg u

(7.20)
is an isomorphism between those elements of s which are the identity on u (and hence can
be regarded as restrictions of elements of s to s) and s/u. furthermore, combining the
prescriptions above we learn that the restrictions of the relevant bi-homomorphisms to the
stabilizer groups are closely related. indeed, denoting by g the restriction of a given element g
of s to s, we have
with g, g  s and kg, kg s.

e(g, g) = kg(g) = g( kg) = f( kg, kg)

(7.21)

8 automorphism types

we have demonstrated in [1] that the reection coecients r[, ]
(,); , i.e. the operator product
coecients in the expansion (5.4)a of a bulk eld approaching the boundary, are equal to one-
dimensional irreducible representations r[, ] of the classifying algebra c( a), evaluated at the
basis element (,) of c( a). thus they are given by (see formula (5.48))

r[, ]
(,);  = r[, ]( (,)) = s(,),[, ]/ s ,[, ] .

(8.1)

6

moreover, it follows from the sum rule (5.22)a and the fact that c( a) is semisimple, that
the reection coecients even provide all inequivalent irreducible c( a)-representations. the
isomorphism classes of irreducible c( a)-representations are in one-to-one correspondence with
the conformally invariant boundary conditions that preserve the orbifold subalgebra a = ag of
the chiral algebra a. in this section we discuss some implications of this basic result.

let us associate to each boundary condition  [, ] the collection of all monodromy
charges qj(), jg, of . the monodromy charges do not depend on the choice of a represen-
tative of the g-orbit [], and via the prescription

g(j) := exp(2iqj())

(8.2)

for all jg, they furnish a character

(8.3)
of the simple current group. (this g-character should not be confused with , which is a
character of the subgroup u g.) the group g = (g) can be naturally identied with the
orbifold group, g  g, and hence the quantity g can be regarded as an element of g.

to proceed, we observe that because of the simple current symmetry

g  g

that was established in formula (5.16), we have

sj(,),[, ] = g(j) s(,),[, ]

r[, ]( j(,)) =

sj(,),[ , ]

s ,[ , ]

= g(j)

s(,),[ , ]
s ,[ , ]

= g(j)  r[, ]( (,))

(8.4)

(8.5)

for every simple current jg. now the reection coecients constitute the main ingredient in
the relation between the boundary blocks b(,) (dened in formula (4.23)a) and the boundary
states b[, ]. when using the notation introduced in (8.2), the precise relationship, established
in formula (6.4), reads

b[, ] = m

1 ms 



g



r[, ]
(,);  h[, ] [, ]



i b(,) .

(8.6)

thus the observation (8.5) tells us that the boundary blocks b(,) for primary elds  of the a-
theory that lie on one and the same g-orbit contribute to the boundary states b[, ] with a xed
relative phase, which is determined by the element g of the orbifold group. put dierently, in
the presence of the boundary condition  [, ] the reection of a bulk eld at the boundary
is twisted by the action of the group element g  g.
this observation suggests that, in the terminology of [12], the orbifold group element g
provides us with the automorphism type 2 of the boundary condition . to establish that this
is indeed the case, we insert the expression (8.1) for the reection coecients and the explicit

2 the corresponding term in [13] is the gluing automorphism. the information contained in a boundary
condition that goes beyond the automorphism type was referred to as the chan--paton type in [12]. thinking in
analogy with the general analysis of modular invariant partition functions on the torus, it may seem to be more
suggestive to take the fusion rule automorphism g as a starting point for the description of the automorphism

so as to arrive at

b(,) .

into formula (8.6),

(8.7)

next we split the summation over all untwisted  into a summation over g-orbits and one
within orbits, and the summation over s into one over u and one over s/u. to this end
we choose (once and for all) arbitrarily a set {} of representatives of the set of g-orbits and
a set {} of representatives of the classes of s/u; more precisely, the symbol  will refer to
the chosen representative of the orbit [], and  s to the chosen representative of the class
in s/u that restricts to u, i.e. satises |u= . then (8.7) becomes

b[, ] = m[]
= m[]

1 mu 
1 mu 

sj(,),[, ]

 mjg/u
s(,),[, ] mjg/u





g

g



bj(,)

g(j) bj(,) .

(8.8)

here in the second line we have used the simple current relation (8.4), as well as the fact that by
this identity the matrix element s(,),[, ] vanishes when g(j)6= 1 for any ju. the latter
observation shows that only those boundary blocks b(,) contribute to the boundary state
b[, ] for which the character g is equal to one on the whole untwisted stabilizer u g, which
in turn implies that g  g is actually an element of s  g, i.e.

g  s .

(8.9)

thus as a character of g the function g factorizes to a character of g/u; according to the
sequence (7.7), the latter group can be identied with s. as we will see later, this result is
perfectly natural.

we now concentrate on the j-summation for xed values of  and . to proceed, we need
a few further tools. first, it turns out to be useful to introduce for every g  s and every j g
the endomorphism
(8.10)

og,j := d1/2

 xls/u

g(l)ojl

of v , where o are the endomorphisms dened by (4.11)a. inserting that formula for o and
type [12]. however, several dierent automorphism types may give rise to one and the same permutation g.
for instance, in the case of wzw theories, automorphisms of the underlying nite-dimensional compact simple
lie algebra g provide us with an automorphism type g, but whenever that automorphism of g is inner, the
associated map g is just the identity. another example is given by the inner automorphisms of the rational free
boson theories whose xed point algebras correspond to the boson theory compactied at an integral multiple
of the original radius; this will be discussed in subsection 16.1.

8

interchanging the order of summations, the maps og,j can also be written in the form

og,j = d2

 xls/u
= xls/u

j(l) r (l) xls/u
j(l) r (l)  l, kg = j( kg) r ( kg) ,

g(l) f(l, l)

(8.11)

where kg s is as dened by formula (7.19), with g s given by g = g
. (because of g  s,
the character g s is the identity on u  s, as required in (7.19). also recall that kg is
dened only up to elements of u; but the result (8.11) for og,j is independent of the choice of
representative.)

|s

with the help of formula (8.11) one checks that

og,jl = g(l) og,j

for all ls ,

(8.12)

and that

og,j og,j = f( kg, kg) ogg,j = e(g, g) ogg,j

(8.13)
for all g, g  s, i.e. the endomorphisms og,j with g  s furnish a projective representation
of the stabilizer s (in the last equality we have used the identity (7.21)). let us also see to
which extent these results depend on the choice of representative . any other representative
is of the form  with  s and |u = id; thus upon choosing a dierent representative the
endomorphisms og,j get replaced by

og,j = ( kg) og,j .

(8.14)

on the other hand, the two-cocycle that characterizes the relevant representation of s does
not depend on this choice. indeed, as a consequence of kgg = kg kg modulo u the maps og,j
satisfy
(8.15)
next we also choose a set {j} of representatives for the classes in g/s and write, for every
(8.16)

og,j og,j = ( kg kg) og,jog,j = f( kg, kg) ogg,j .

g  s,

g(j) (og,j  id )  pj  ,

g  ()

g

:= mjg/s

where og,j is dened in (8.10) and p is the projector from the a-module h to its isotypical
component of type h. owing to the identity (8.12), g is in fact independent of the choice of
representatives j (whereas og,j does again depend on that choice), and from (8.13) it follows
that

(8.17)
for all g, g  s. let us also note that when specializing to the a-vacuum sector, where
u = s = g, we simply have kg = 1 and hence og,j = id for all jg, so that ()
g(j)pj.

g g = f( kg, kg) gg

g =ljg

9

with these results at hand, we can now address the j-summation that appears in formula

(8.8). inserting the denition (4.23)a of the boundary blocks b, we nd that

mjg/u

g(j) bj(,) = mjg/s
= n d2

g(l) b(j,jl)

g(j) mls/u
 mjg/s
  ( mls/u

g(j) mls/u

jl(l) r (l)  id )  bj  ,

g(l)

(8.18)

where : v v +
l-summation, this becomes

  c is the non-degenerate linear form dened in (4.21). performing the

mjg/u

g(j) bj(,) = n mjg/s

with

g(j)   (j( kg) r ( kg)  id )  bj  = n b(g)



(8.19)

b(g)
 := b  (g  id ) .

(8.20)

here b = b(1)

(4.25), and we have used that via the identity (4.17)a they can be written in the form

are the boundary blocks of the a-theory, which are given by the expression

b  b[, ] = n 1

= d1/2

b(j,) = n 1

 mjg/s

  ( xls/u

 mjg/s mls/u
ol  id )  bj = mjg/s

b(j,l)

(8.21)

  bj .

at this point it is worth realizing that the twisted intertwining property (7.2) of g is formulated
independently of the subalgebra a, and hence g only depends on the automorphism g itself,
but not on the particular orbifold group g containing g we are considering. by the result (8.20),
this independence on the choice of g then holds for the quantities b(g)

 , too.

inserting the result (8.19) into formula (8.8), we nally see that

b = m[]

1

g



nmu 



s(,), b(g)



.

(8.22)

thus, in summary, the boundary state b can be entirely constructed from the information
contained in the boundary blocks b[, ] together with the action of s they carry and in the
character g of g. as we will see, this implies that g indeed constitutes the automorphism
type of the boundary condition . we have also seen that only those boundary blocks b(,)
contribute to the boundary state b for which the stabilizer s contains g (which, incidentally,
shows that the factorization to a character of g/u is a rather natural property of the elements
of s). this should be regarded as a selection rule on the possible boundary blocks that show
up in the boundary state; the concrete form of this selection rule is completely determined by
the automorphism type of the boundary condition.

10

our derivation also demonstrates that in the case of our interest one can associate an
automorphism of the chiral algebra a to every boundary condition. this comes as a result
of our analysis and does not have to be put in as an assumption.
in contrast, when the
subalgebra a that is preserved by a boundary condition is not an orbifold subalgebra ag, then
the boundary condition need not necessarily possess an automorphism type. indeed, as we will
see in section 16.3, most conformally invariant boundary conditions of the z2-orbifold of a free
boson, compactied at a rational radius squared, do not posses an automorphism type.

9 twisted blocks and twisted ward identities

in the discussion of automorphism types above we have introduced, for every primary label
 [, ] of the a-theory and for every element g  s of the orbifold group that stabilizes ,
the map g (8.16) as well as the linear form b(g)
 = b  (gid ) (8.20) on the tensor product
a-module h h+. we will refer to the latter linear forms as g-twisted boundary blocks. as
demonstrated in the previous section, every boundary state b is a linear combination of those
twisted boundary blocks b(g)

for which the twist g lies in s.



what still remains to be established is that the notation for the maps g that was intro-
duced in (8.16) is in agreement with the use of the same notation in section 7, i.e. that these
maps satisfy the g-twisted intertwining property (7.2). to address this issue, we need some
information about the representation r of a on the subspaces in the decomposition (7.6) of a
a-module h  h[, ] into irreducible a-modules. while a complete description of the action
of the vertex operator algebra that is obtained by a simple current extension is not yet available,
the known results naturally suggest the following structure. on the a-module v  hj  h
an element yj(z) y (vj; z) of a with vj  hj h is represented by
rj ( yj) .

r[, ](yj) = r (j)  mjg/s

(9.1)

here j is dened by j = jj
(8.16)), and rj ( yj) is a map from hj  to hj
properties

 with j

 the representative for a class in g/s (see before formula
j . to proceed we use the commutation

r (j) r ( kg)= f(j, kg) r ( kg) r (j) = g(j) r ( kg) r (j)

here in the last expression the element g of the orbifold group is to be regarded as an automor-
phism of the chiral algebra a, while in the intermediate steps it is interpreted as a character
of the simple current group g = g. formula (9.5) reproduces the twisted intertwiner property
(7.2) and hence is the desired result.
we also remark that according to section 7 the twisted intertwiners carry a projective
representation that is characterized by the cohomology class of the cocycle e or, equivalently,
by the commutator cocycle e. on the other hand, according to relation (8.17) the concrete
realization (8.16) of the twisted intertwiners can be characterized by the commutator cocycle
f. this is compatible because of the identity (7.21).

now for every eld y (z) =pnz ynzny of conformal weight y in the chiral algebra

 of the a-theory obeys the ward identity appropriate for

a, the ordinary boundary block b(1)
a two-point block on p1. that is,

b(1)
  (r(yn)  1 + y 1  r(yn)) = 0

(9.6)

with y = (1)y 1. when combined with the denition (8.20) of the twisted boundary blocks,
the twisted intertwiner property (9.5) therefore allows us to write (suppressing from now on
the representation symbol r)

b(g)
  (yn  1) = b  (g  id) (yn  1) = b  (g(yn)  1)  (g  id)

= y b  (1  g(yn))  (g  id) = y b(g)

  (1  g(yn)) .

thus the twisted boundary states satisfy a twisted ward identity

b(g)
  (yn  1 + y 1  g(yn)) = 0 .

(9.7)

(9.8)

it is worth noting that we have dened the twisted ward identities (9.8) through an au-
tomorphism of a that only acts on the second factor of the tensor product. one could easily
generalize this by considering the action of two dierent automorphisms gl and gr on the two
factors, according to

b(g)
  (gl(yn)  1 + y 1  gr(yn)) = 0 .

(9.9)

but obviously what matters is only the combination g1
l gr. thus we can describe the space of
automorphism types either as the coset space (g g)/g or as the group g. in fact, the map
(gl, gr)7 g1
l gr provides a natural bijection between the two sets which, in the case when g
is a lie group, is even an isomorphism of smooth manifolds. (for theories of free bosons, the
description in terms of (g g)/g has been established in [14].)

10 the classifying algebra c(g) for automorphism type g

10.1

individual classifying algebras for xed automorphism type

we now restrict our attention to the collection of boundary conditions that possess some xed
automorphism type g. according to the results of section 8 the corresponding boundary states
can all be written as linear combinations of the twisted boundary blocks (8.20) with xed g.
this suggests to study analogous elements of the classifying algebra; accordingly we introduce
for every  with g  s the linear combination

 := |u|
(g)

|g| xjg/u

g(j) j(,)

(10.1)

of basis elements of the classifying algebra c( a), where by  and  (which satises   
for  [, ] ) are the representatives introduced in the paragraph before formula (8.8). to
proceed, we also note the relation

xjg/u

g(j) sj(,), = (|g|/|u|) g,g

s(,),

(10.2)

that follows for every g  s with the help of the simple current symmetry (8.4). (when g is
not in s, then according to the remarks after (8.8) this expression vanishes.)
using the verlinde-like formula that expresses the structure constants of c( a) in terms of
the diagonalizing matrix s, the result (10.2) allows us to compute the product of two elements
of c( a) of the form (10.1) as

  (g)
(g)

 = g,gx

n(g)

n(g) 
,  n(g) 

, ( a) := x

 ),( s ,)1 .

 ,

this means that the elements (g)
for all  with g  s span not only a subalgebra, but even

an ideal of the classifying algebra c( a). we call this ideal of c( a) the individual classifying
algebra for automorphism type g and denote it by c(g)( a). also, by construction the (g)
 are
linearly independent, and hence they furnish a basis of c(g)( a), i.e. for every xed g g we
have
(10.5)
clearly, c(g)( a) is again semisimple; its one-dimensional irreducible representations are obtained
by restriction to c(g)( a) of those one-dimensional irreducible representations r of c( a) which
satisfy g = g.
for all 
and all g  g span all of c( a). namely, associated to every g-orbit [] of a-primaries there are

moreover, the following counting argument shows that together the elements (g)


c(g)( a) = spanc{(g)

4 note that this expression is only dened when g  s  s  s .

13

|u| many a-primaries [, ], and each of them gives rise to |s| many basis elements (g)
 . on
the other hand, each such g-orbit contains |g|/|s| many a-primaries, each of them leading to
|s| many basis elements (,) of c( a). with the help of the identities (7.9) among the sizes
of the various subgroups it thus follows that

x

|s| = x

|s| .

(10.6)

qg ()=0

as a consequence we have indeed  as algebras over c, and with the distinguished bases related
by (10.1)  an isomorphism

c( a) =mgg

c(g)( a) .

(10.7)

this decomposition may be regarded as expressing the fact that in the situation of our interest
every boundary condition has an automorphism type. put dierently, the algebra c( a) provides
a unied description of the boundary conditions for the |g| dierent automorphism types that
correspond to the elements of g.
in the special case of trivial automorphism type, g = 1, we can use the result [1] that
s(,), = s, for all  with g = 1 to see that the ideal c(1)( a) is nothing but the fusion rule
algebra of the a-theory, so that we recover the known results [15, 3] for boundary conditions
that do not break any of the bulk symmetries. it should also be noticed that the precise form
of the structure constants of the ideals c(g)( a) does depend on the choice of representatives 
and  (except when g = 1, where independence of this choice follows as a consequence of the
simple current relation (8.4)). this is, however, perfectly ne, because the twisted boundary
block depends on the choice of representatives as well, and in fact in a manner so as to cancel
the overall dependence in all physically meaningful quantities like one-point correlators for bulk
elds on the disk.

independence of c(g) on the orbifold group

10.2
a remarkable feature of the formula (10.4) for the structure constants of c(g)( a) is that the
automorphism type g just enters by restricting the range of summation. this suggests that the
individual classifying algebra for automorphism type g in fact does not depend on the specic
orbifold subalgebra a, i.e. on the group g that contains the automorphism g, but rather on
g alone. below we will show that this is indeed the case, and actually the statement already
applies to the relevant entries of the diagonalizing matrix s. now recall from section 8 (see
the remarks after formula (8.21)) that a similar statement applies to the twisted boundary
blocks b(g)
 . when combined with the present result, then according to formula (8.22) this
independence property of the blocks b(g)
 , which are chiral quantities, extends to the (non-
chiral) boundary states b.
to prove the independence of c(g)( a) on the choice of orbifold group g containing g, it is
convenient to study the orbifold with respect to the cyclic group

g := <g> = z|g|

14

(10.8)

that is generated by g. we rst note that the diagonalizing matrix s for the total classifying
algebra c(a) of all boundary conditions preserving a = a<g>  a is given by the expression
(5.9)a which contains contributions involving the various matrices sj (though in this special
cyclic case the formula simplies). however, in the expression for the structure constants of
c(g)(a) only those entries s(,),[, ] appear for which g  s, and these entries turn out to
indeed, since g generates <g>, the latter property means that the
be particularly simple.
stabilizer is maximal, s = g; by the duality relation u = g/s this implies s =u = 1.
similarly, because of g = g the monodromy charges of  with respect to the extension from
a to a have denominator |g|, so that  cannot be a xed point under any simple current in
g, which implies that also s =u = 1. thus we have to deal with full g-orbits only; in
particular the simple current summation in the formula for s reduces to the term with j = 1:

s,[, ] =

|s 

|g|
||s 

||u 

||u 
|

s, = |g| s, .

(10.9)

to proceed, we note that the algebra a = a<g> can be obtained from a = ag as a simple

current extension by the subgroup

g := {jg | g(j) = 1}

(10.10)

of the simple current group g = g. (the subgroup g has index |g| in g; in fact, the factor
group g/g is cyclic of order |g|.) in particular, the modular s-matrix s of the a-theory can
be expressed through quantities of the a-theory as

s, =

|s 

|g |
||s 

||u 

||u 

| xju 

u 


(j) sj
,

(j)

(10.11)

with   [, ] and   [, ].

the a-theory has a simple current of the form

(10.12)
where jg g is a simple current of the a-theory that is characterized by the property that |g|
is the smallest positive integer m such that (jg)m lies in g, so that jg has order |g|. by this
property of jg and the denition (10.10) of g it follows that

jg = jg  g  [jg] ,

g(jm

g k) = g(jm

g ) 6= 1

(10.13)

for every k g and every m = 1, 2, ... ,|g|1. this means that none of the monodromy
g k() vanishes, so that  cannot be a xed point with respect to any of these
charges qjm
g k. it follows that the stabilizer s is contained in g, which in turn implies
simple currents jm
that s =s and hence also u =u. as a consequence, the boundary labels [, ] of the
matrix s that satisfy g = g are precisely the same as those appearing in formula (10.11) for
s, and the simple current summation in the expression for the corresponding entries of s only

15

runs over elements of g. using also the fact that s =s g, we can therefore write

s(,),[, ] =

=

|g|

|s||u||s||u| xjsu
| xjs 
|g||g |
|s||u||s 

||u 

u 


(j) sj
,

(j)

(j) sj
,

(j) .

(10.14)

furthermore, because of g = g the simple current relation (8.4) for s implies that these
entries of s are identical for all  on one and the same g-orbit. we may therefore equate the
expression (10.14) with its average over s. the simple current relation for the matrices sj
then amounts to a restriction of the summation to u , so that

s(,),[, ] =

|g||g |
|s||u||s 

||u 

| xju 

u 


(j) sj
,

(j) = |g|r|s 

|
||u 
|s||u|

s[,  ],[,  ] .

(10.15)
to analyze the prefactor appearing here, we rst remark that the index of the subgroup s
in s is some divisor n of |g|. there is a simple current j s which plays an analogous
role for the embedding ss as jg plays for the embedding of g in g, i.e. n is the smallest
power such that jn
 k with k s

and m = 1, 2, ... , n1. moreover, from the fact that g  s it follows with the help of duality
 6u for all m = 1, 2, ... , n1, and hence we have u s. thus when forming the
that jm
untwisted stabilizer associated to s one does not lose any elements of u, so that uu.
observing that u is precisely the kernel of the group homomorphism from u to c that maps
k u to the nth root of unity f(j, k), it follows that the index of u in u is n. thus
we have
(10.16)

is in s, and the elements of s are of the form jm

so that (10.15) reduces to

|s| /|s| = n = |u| /|u| ,
s(,),[, ] = |g| s[,  ],[,  ] .

(10.17)

comparison with (10.9) then shows that the relevant matrix elements of s are identical to

those of s. we conclude that

c(g)(ag) = c(g)(a<g>) =: c(g)

(10.18)

for every nite abelian orbifold group g with g g.
it is worth pointing out that the fact
that the individual classifying algebra does not depend on the preserved subalgebra constitutes
another quite non-trivial check of our ansatz for the diagonalizing matrix s. we also learn that
the structure constants of the algebra c(g) read

n(g)

i.e. as a linear combination of fusion coecients of the a<g>-theory.

it is reasonable to expect that similar considerations apply to orbifold subalgebras with
respect to non-abelian groups g, too, so that in particular also in that case every boundary
condition possesses a denite automorphism type. assuming this to be true, the classifying
algebras for xed automorphism type studied here should coincide with their analogues in the
non-abelian case. in other words, the set of boundary conditions will be exhausted by those
boundary conditions that are already known from the cyclic groups <g> for all g  g. (on the
other hand, the detailed structure of the classifying algebra, which involves the distinguished
basis { }, will still be more involved.)

10.3 relation with traces on bundles of chiral blocks

the independence on the specic group g nds its natural explanation in the fact that these
numbers are interpretable as traces of appropriate maps on bundles of chiral blocks [12].
namely, since for every  we are given the twisted intertwiner maps ()
g : h  hg (7.1),
we also have the corresponding tensor product maps

~g  ~(1 2 ... m)

g,g,...,g

:= (1)

g  (2)

g    (m)

g

(10.21)

on tensor products of a-modules. in view of the denition [16, 17] of chiral blocks v12...m as
singlets (with respect to a suitable block algebra) in the algebraic dual (h1h2  hm)
of these tensor products, the twisted intertwining property together with the fact that the
automorphism g respects the grading of the chiral algebra implies the existence of a linear map

~g  ~ (1 2 ... m)

g,g,...,g

:

v1 2 ... m  vg1 g2 ... gm

(10.22)

between spaces of chiral blocks. when gi = i for all i = 1, 2, ... , m, this linear map ~g is
an endomorphism so that one can compute its trace; we will be interested in the traces of
three-point blocks. (a concrete description of the block algebras and hence of the maps ~g
is so far only available for the case of wzw theories, where the situation can be analyzed in
terms of the horizontal subalgebra of the relevant ane lie algebra.) now in the case of our
interest, where all simple current stabilizers in the a-theory are trivial, the fusion rules of the
a-theory can be expressed through the modular s-matrix of the a-theory as

1

qg ()=0

(10.23)

n j

this indicates that the chiral three-point blocks of our interest can be decomposed into the
direct sum of spaces of chiral blocks of the a-theory. such a decomposition should in fact
be expected on general grounds, and the chiral blocks of the a-theory should t together to
sub-bundles of the bundles of chiral blocks of the a-theory. now when restricted to irreducible
a-modules the maps g are ordinary intertwiners, and as a consequence the map ~g acts

17

on the subspaces of chiral blocks as a multiple of the identity. on the subspace of dimension
n(g) j
the map ~g should therefore act with eigenvalue g(j). it thus follows that upon choosing
,
representatives of the g-orbits, the trace of this map is precisely given by the number (10.20):
(10.24)

= n(g) 

, (a<g>) .

for g 6= 1 these numbers do depend on the choice of representatives  of the orbits  [], in
agreement with the fact that the maps ~g are dened only up to a phase.

11 t-duality

in all the considerations so far, we have required that the torus partition function, and cor-
respondingly the pairing of the labels  and  of the bulk elds ,, is given by charge con-
jugation, which we denote by c :  = c () +.
in this section we analyze what happens
when a dierent torus partition function is chosen. 5 to this end we rst have to state what
we mean by a chiral algebra a and its automorphisms in more concrete terms than was done
so far. in mathematical terms, a chiral algebra 6 is a vertex operator algebra [19, 20]; the rele-
vant data are therefore the vector space h, the vacuum vector h, the virasoro element
vvir h, and a vertex operator map y . the latter realizes the state-eld correspondence,
i.e. associates to every v h a eld operator y (v; z) (technically, a linear map from h to
end(h)  c[[z,z1]] with z a formal variable), e.g. the energy-momentum tensor t to the
virasoro element, y (vvir; z) = t (z). by an automorphism of a vertex operator algebra a we
mean an invertible linear map

that is compatible with state-eld correspondence, i.e. satises

 : h  h

1 y (v; z)  = y (v; z)

(11.1)

(11.2)

for all v h. (let us stress that  unlike e.g. in [21]  at this point we do not require that the
map  leaves the vacuum and the virasoro element xed.) as already outlined in section 7, each
such map is accompanied by a permutation  of the label set i :={} of a-primaries and by
twisted intertwiners   ()
 : h h between the corresponding irreducible a-modules.
to proceed, we introduce two particular subgroups of the group  of all maps f from i to
aut(a). for every f   and every  i, the image

f := f () : h  h

(11.3)

5 it is by no means necessary that the permutation that (for maximally extended chiral algebra) characterizes
the torus partition function is equal to the permutation g dened via the automorphism type  if such an
automorphism type exists at all  of a boundary condition. while both mappings are associated to the transition
from chiral conformal eld theory (i.e., conformal eld theory on a complex curve) to full conformal eld theory
(conformal eld theory on a real two-dimensional surface), they refer to such a transition for two dierent world
sheets  the disk and the torus, respectively  which are not related by any factorization rules. as a consequence,
they can be chosen independently.

6 not to be confused with the global object for which the term chiral algebra has also been used in the recent

mathematical literature [18], which we prefer to call a block algebra.

18

is an automorphism in aut(a). we denote by z the subgroup of all those elements f of  for
which the map 7

f :

i  i

preserves conformal weights modulo integers, i.e. fulls 
an automorphism of the fusion rules, i.e. satises

 () = n,,

f () =  mod z for all  i, and is

e.g. [6, 22].) every element of z gives rise to a modular invariant torus partition function

(11.4)

(11.5)

zf ( ) :=xi

( ) 

f (+)( ) .



(11.6)

the second subgroup of  of our interest consists of constant maps f whose image  to be
denoted by gf  is an automorphism of a that leaves the virasoro element xed, gf (vvir) = vvir
(and hence in particular obeys gf () =  and preserves conformal weights exactly, not only
modulo integers). we denote the subgroup of those maps of this kind that also lie 8 in z
by b. every automorphism gf of this subgroup of z with f  b can be used to dene
conformally invariant boundary conditions. furthermore, for every f  b and every f  z
the modular invariant partition functions zf  and zf f  are physically indistinguishable, i.e.
upon a suitable relabelling of the elds all correlation functions in the associated conformal
eld theories coincide. accordingly, it is appropriate to refer to b as the t-duality group of
the theory. for every chiral algebra a the t-duality group b contains in particular the map
fc whose image is the charge conjugation automorphism c, i.e. fc() = c for all  i, and
fc() = c() = +.
the two theories with partition functions zf  and zf f  being indistinguishable, in particular
the respective sets of all conformally invariant boundary conditions must be the same. it is
worth investigating this correspondence in some detail. let us denote for any f  b and any
f  z by
(11.7)
the classifying algebra for boundary conditions of automorphism type gf for a conformal eld
theory with torus partition function zf . recall from section 10 that this algebra (as well as
its distinguished basis) can be constructed by starting with any arbitrary nite abelian group
g containing g. as also discussed there, for the case where f = fc corresponds to charge
conjugation, the structure constants of c(gf ;f ) are given by the traces over the linear maps
induced by gf

c(gf ;f )  c(gf ;f )(a<g>)

on the three-point chiral blocks:

(gf ;fc)
,, = trv,,(~ (  )
n
gf ,gf ,gf

) .

(11.8)

7 note that typically several distinct f   will give rise to one and the same permutation 
f .
8 in fact one should expect that the property of inducing a fusion rule automorphism need not be required
independently, but is satised automatically as a consequence of the consistency of the relevant orbifold theory.
this has been demonstrated in the case of order-two automorphisms in [5]. indeed, consistency of the orbifold
theory requires that the s-matrix of the a-theory behaves with respect to the permutation g that is induced by
the non-trivial element g of z2 via the maps g as s,g = sg,. when combined with the verlinde formula,
this implies that g furnishes an automorphism of the fusion rules of the a-theory.

19

in the general case, what should matter are not the individual maps f and f by themselves, but
rather only the information on how the pairing described by the boundary conditions relates
to the pairing in the torus partition function.
in other words, a simultaneous action of an
element of b on both labels of the classifying algebra c(gf ;f ) will not change the situation in
an observable manner. a well-known example of this eect is seen in the theory of a free boson
compactied at radius r, where the t-duality map r7 2/r (which corresponds to f 7 f fc)
amounts to exchanging dirichlet and neumann conditions (compare subsection 15.1).
(for
orbifolds of free bosons, t-duality has been studied recently e.g. in [23].)

in short, for every f  b there is an isomorphism

c(gf f  ;f f ) = c(gf ;f )

(11.9)

of classifying algebras. with the help of these isomorphisms we deduce that the structure
constants of the classifying algebra c(gf ;fcf ) are given by the traces
) .

(11.10)

(gf ;fcf )
,, = trv,,(~ (  )
n

f  ,gf g1

f  ,gf g1
f 

in this formula it is manifest that simultaneous application of a t-duality transformation f  b
on the bulk modular invariant and on the automorphism type of the boundary conditions does
yield isomorphic classifying algebras.

building on this result, we expect that formula (11.10) extends naturally to arbitrary el-
ements f of z, i.e. to the case that f is not necessarily constant on i. we are thus led to
conjecture that in this case the relation (11.10) gets generalized to 9

(gf ;fcf )
,, = trv,, (~ (  )
n

) .

(11.11)

in the special case of dodd-type modular invariants (which correspond to a simple current
automorphism for an order-two simple current of half-integral conformal weight), the relation
(11.11) is already known [24, 25] to hold.

our observations imply in particular that the automorphism type g of a boundary condition
is not an observable concept. what is observable is the product g1
, i.e. the dierence
between an automorphism in the torus partition function and on the boundary. (in other words,
one should regard automorphism types as elements of the anum  see section 12 below 
of the group b rather than as elements of b itself.) similarly, also the dierence g(g)1 of
two automorphism types is observable; e.g. the annulus partition function will be dierent in
the situation where one deals with two boundary conditions of distinct automorphism type as
compared to the situation where the automorphism type of both boundary conditions is the
same.

f

while in the considerations above the t-duality transformations had to be applied to the
torus partition function and to the boundary conditions simultaneously, there is also a slightly
dierent notion of t-duality for boundary conditions, to which we now turn our attention.

9 one might have expected that here products of -maps rather than the -map for the product of auto-
morphisms appears. but when the group z is realized projectively, this would lead to inconsistencies. when
z is realized genuinely, then the two descriptions are equivalent.

20

namely, we keep the bulk theory xed, and ask whether boundary conditions of dierent
automorphism type can be associated to each other through a suitable element of the t-
duality group. while in many cases this question turns out to have an armative answer,
the relationship in question is between families of boundary conditions rather than between
individual boundary conditions. in short, t-duality on boundary conditions is not a one-to-one
map, in general. closer inspection shows that the relevant families of boundary conditions can
be understood as orbits of boundary conditions with respect to some suitable symmetry. here
by the term symmetry we mean a bijection  of the space of boundary conditions of a given
automorphism type g such that the annulus amplitudes coincide, i.e.

a() ()(t) = a (t)

(11.12)

for all ,  with automorphism type g = g = g.

let us study the presence of such a symmetry rst in the example of the critical three-state
potts model. it is known [26] that the duality symmetry of this model maps the free boundary
condition to any of the three xed boundary conditions, and indeed this is a specic case of
the general duality [27] between free and congurational boundary conditions of lattice spin
models. similarly, the new boundary condition discovered in [26] gets mapped to any of the
three mixed boundary conditions. in this case the symmetry group h = z3 of the xed or mixed
boundary conditions is directly inherited from the lattice realization of the potts model. we also
observe that precisely those boundary conditions for which this z3-symmetry is spontaneously
broken are grouped in non-trivial orbits. furthermore, one readily checks that for orbits that
are related by the t-duality t = c , the sum rule

roughly speaking, the sum rule (11.13) tells us that t-dual orbits give rise to an equal number
of open string states on the boundary.

this pattern can be detected in various other examples as well. for instance, in the theory
of a single uncompactied free boson, there is a single neumann boundary condition, whereas
the dirichlet boundary conditions are labelled by a position in r, which should be interpreted
as the ane space over the group h = r of translations. this group is spontaneously broken
for dirichlet boundary conditions, and it is straightforward to check that relations (11.12) and
(11.13) are satised in this case as well. another class of examples is provided by boundary
conditions in wzw theories that break the bulk symmetry via an inner automorphism of the
underlying simple lie algebra g. in these cases the boundary conditions of each automorphism
type are labelled by the same set, namely by the primary labels of the original theory (see [5]
for the case of automorphisms of order two). the group h is in this case realized by the action
of simple currents of the original theory, which account for the dierent possible choices of the
shift vector that characterizes the inner automorphism of g. again the validity of relations
(11.12) and (11.13) is easily veried.

we would like to emphasize, though, that the existence of such t-duality relations is in
fact a quite special feature of an individual model. in general we do not expect that boundary
conditions of dierent automorphism type are related in such a manner. for instance, in the

21

case of boundary conditions of wzw theories that break the bulk symmetry via an outer
automorphism of g, no relations of the form (11.12) or (11.13) are known to us.

12 boundary homogeneity

in this section we exhibit another general aspect of the space of conformally invariant boundary
conditions that preserve only a subalgebra a of a. namely, we show that the orbifold group
g is realized as a group of symmetries on the space of boundary conditions. these symmetries
permute the boundary conditions within each set {[, ]|  u} with xed g-orbit []; the
permutation is the same for all g-orbits. this behavior, to which we refer as boundary ho-
mogeneity, is similar to the so-called xed point homogeneity that is present in simple current
extensions, and indeed the arguments closely resemble the ones needed in the latter context [4].
we start from the observation that the orbifold group g can be identied with the dual g
of the simple current group g = g, and consider some character  of g. for every eld  of
the a-theory and every character  u we then dene a new character  u by

(j) := (j) (j)

(12.1)

for all ju. this is indeed again a character of u. moreover, manifestly the group law of
g is reproduced for dierent choices of , so that our construction provides an action of g on
the group u . typically g does not act freely, but it does act transitively.
the next step is to realize that this prescription supplies us with a well dened action on the
space of boundary conditions. this is not entirely trivial, because the labels for the boundary
conditions are not pairs of orbits, but rather are obtained by the equivalence relation (a.9),
i.e. (, ) j (, ) (j, j ), which involves a non-trivial manipulation of the characters.
however, this complication does not do any harm, because just as for the action of g it
consists of a multiplication, so that the two operations commute. we write

 := [,]

for  = [, ] .

(12.2)

similarly, when we extend by some smaller group g g, we can dene the analogous object
[, ] := [, ].
let us now explain in which sense the elements of g are to be regarded as symmetries.

using the explicit expression (6.29) for the annulus coecients, we can establish the identity

a

[, ]
[1, 1] [2, 2]

= a[, ]

[1, 1] [2, 2]

(12.3)

between annulus coecients. thus when we also act on the corresponding chiral labels of
the open string states in the annulus amplitude, we can absorb the transformation into a
relabelling of the summation variables, so as to conclude that the annulus partition function
is invariant. we expect that this extends indeed to a full-edged symmetry at the level of
correlation functions, where again one has to act on the insertions on the boundary.

as a consequence, the boundary conditions that correspond to one and the same g-orbit
[] should in fact better be labelled by the elements of what may be called the anum over
the character group u rather than by u itself. here by the term anum over a group g we

22

refer to the elementary structure of a set ag that carries a free and transitive action of g. 10
conversely, the group g can be identied with the quotient of ag  ag by the equivalence
relation (p, q) (ph, qh) for all h g. for every p ag we are given an identication g  pg
between the group g and its anum ag, but there does not exist any canonical identication.
roughly speaking, in the structure of the anum one ignores the special role played by the
identity element; thus an anum and its group are related in much the same way as an ane
space av is related to the corresponding vector space v , which can be identied with its group
of translations. indeed, the group of automorphisms (that is, bijections intertwining the action
of g) of an anum ag is precisely g. it follows that any two ana over g are isomorphic; but
the isomorphism is never canonical; it is always determined only up to the isomorphism group
g.

we should admit that, even though we avoided using the term, the concept of an anum is
already implicit at several other places of our discussion of boundary conditions. for instance,
the quantities  and  that appear in the denition (5.9)a of the matrix s are best regarded
as elements of the ana of the respective character groups, because [28] the matrices sj are
only dened up to certain changes of basis in the space of one-point blocks on the torus and
because such a change amounts to a relabelling of the characters.

we nally add a comment on how this symmetry property of the boundary conditions looks
like in the case of the three-state potts model. in this case it exchanges simultaneously two
xed and two mixed boundary conditions, while it leaves the third xed and mixed boundary
condition invariant. in the potts model we actually have yet another symmetry on the space of
boundary conditions, the action of a z3-group. these two symmetries combine to the symmetric
group s3.

13 the universal classifying algebra
the decomposition (10.7) of the classifying algebra c( a) into individual classifying algebras
for xed automorphism types implies that for every subgroup h of the orbifold group g one
has c(ah )c(ag). indeed, c(ah ) is just the direct sum of the ideals c(g)( a)c(ag) for all
it is also known [8] that the mapping h 7 ah provides a bijection between the set
g  h.
of subgroups of g and the set of consistent chiral subalgebras of a that contain ag. 11 in our
situation the orbifold group g is abelian, but the latter result continues to hold for all nilpotent
nite groups [9] and is expected to be true for arbitrary nite orbifold groups. 12

in this section we would like to address the issue of consecutive breakings of bulk symmetries
in more generality, which leads us in particular to introduce the notion of a universal classifying
algebra. while our detailed studies have so far been restricted to cases where the preserved
subalgebra a of the bulk symmetries satises a = ag for some nite abelian group g, it is
10 thus there exists a map a g a acting as (p, g)7 pg such that pg = p if and only if g = e, pgh = (pg)h,
and such that for each pair (p, q) a a there is a unique g  g with pg = q. when g is non-abelian, one must
distinguish between left and right actions, and hence left and right ana.
11 a similar galois correspondence has been established in the context of braided monoidal *-categories in [29].
12 assuming that the statement holds for every group within a certain class x, it follows in particular that
whenever there exists at least one boundary condition that does not possess an automorphism type, then the
virasoro algebra by itself cannot be the orbifold subalgebra of a with respect to any group that belongs to x.

23

reasonable to expect that several features of our analysis will persist for general a. in particular,
it should again be possible to determine a classifying algebra, provided that the following two
pieces of information are available:

the decomposition of a-modules into direct sums of irreducible a-modules;
concrete expressions relating the bundles of chiral blocks of the a-theory with those of the

a-theory.
we also expect that the statements about inclusions of classifying algebras valid for the case of
nite abelian orbifold groups generalize as follows. to every inclusion a  a of preserved bulk
symmetry algebras there is associated a projection of the corresponding classifying algebras;
the classifying algebra for a is a suitable quotient of the one for a. more generally, for every
chain of inclusions

(13.1)

(13.2)

a  a  a

of symmetry algebras, there should exist a corresponding chain of projections

c( a)

 c(a) 

 c(a)

for the associated classifying algebras. as a consequence, every irreducible representation of
c(a) gives rise to an irreducible representation of c( a). this makes sense indeed: an irreducible
representation of c(a) corresponds to a boundary condition that preserves a and thus, a
fortiori, also preserves the smaller algebra a; it should therefore correspond to some irreducible
representation of c( a). relation (13.2) clearly holds when both a = ag and a = ah are
orbifold subalgebras for abelian orbifold groups with h  g. (moreover, the projections are
compatible with the distinguished bases of the algebras, compare e.g. the arguments leading to
formula (10.18) for the case h = <g>). more generally, one can hope to obtain this way also
quantitative information on solvable orbifold groups.

this way the following picture emerges. the set m of all consistent subalgebras of a given
chiral algebra a that possess the same virasoro element as a is partially ordered by inclusion.
it is reasonable to expect that m is even an inductive system; that is, given any two consistent
subalgebras a1 and a2 of a, one can nd another consistent subalgebra a3 that is contained
in their intersection,

a3  a1  a2 .

(13.3)

note that this implies in particular that we do not have to make the assumption that the
intersection of all consistent subalgebras of a contains a consistent subalgebra; rather, one only
needs to deal with intersections of nitely many subalgebras.

assuming that also in general the inclusion a1  a2 implies that the classifying algebra for
a2 is a quotient of the one for a1, one arrives at a projective system ( ai) of classifying algebras.
taking the projective limit over this system, we then arrive at a universal classifying algebra

c := lim


ai .

(13.4)

(the projective limit of the closely related structure of a fusion ring has been studied in [30].)
by construction, this algebra c governs all conformally invariant boundary conditions. in
other words, it is the classifying algebra c(vir) for the case where the preserved subalgebra
just consists of the virasoro algebra. the universal classifying algebra can be found explicitly

24

in simple models, e.g. for the free boson compactied on a circle or for the z2-orbifold of these
theories (see subsection 16.1).

the construction of a surjective homomorphism : c( a)c(a) that maps the elements
of the distinguished basis b of c( a) to elements of the distinguished basis b of c(a) is in
fact straightforward as far as the -part of the labels (, ) for b are concerned. in contrast,
concerning the -part one faces complications which stem from the absence of a simple rela-
tionship between u and u (this fact had also to be taken into account in the manipulations
that were necessary to establish integrality of the annulus coecients, see subsection 6.4 of [1]).
as a matter of fact, for a complete discussion of this issue even in the case of abelian orbifold
subalgebras additional simple current technology is required that goes beyond the results of [4].
in particular it will be necessary to implement the powerful results that have recently been
obtained in [31].

we also note that for consistency, along with the projection  there should come an injection
 from the set of boundary conditions that preserve a to those that preserve a, in such a way
that the diagonalizing matrices for c( a) and for c(a) are related as

s(,),([, ])  s((,)),[, ] .

(13.5)

again the explicit construction of  proves to be dicult; it will not be pursued here.

14 involutary boundary conditions

in this section we focus our attention to the situation where the symmetries a = ag that are
preserved by the boundary conditions form a subalgebra that is xed by an involution . in
other words, for such involutary boundary conditions the orbifold group g is just the z2-group
consisting of  and the identity. for the associated z2-orbifolds, a lot of information is available
(see e.g. [32, 5]. the vacuum sector of the a-theory decomposes into subspaces as

with j a simple current of order two, and the automorphism  acts as

h = h   hj

| h 

= id h 

,

| hj

= id hj

.

(14.1)

(14.2)

involutary subalgebras are very special indeed. several of the structures that required a detailed
discussion in the general case are realized rather trivially here. for instance, as cyclic groups
have trivial second cohomology, all untwisted stabilizers are equal to the full stabilizers; this
already simplies various equations considerably.

the reason why we nevertheless study this simple situation in quite some detail is that it is
realized in various interesting systems. we will soon display several of these examples, but rst
we summarize some generic features of the z2 case; in particular we will study the individual
classifying algebra for automorphism type .

14.1 even and odd boundary conditions
in the case at hand, the orbifold group g and the simple current group g = g are both
isomorphic to z2. thus in particular the exponentiated monodromy charge g takes its value

25

in z2, so that there are just two automorphism types of boundary conditions. we refer to
those boundary conditions whose automorphism type is given by the identity as even boundary
conditions while those with automorphism type  will be called odd .

the chan--paton types for the even boundary conditions are labelled by the primary elds
 of the a-theory, while those for the odd boundary conditions are labelled by the orbits of
primary elds of the orbifold theory (whose chiral algebra is a = az2) with monodromy charge
qj = 1/2. the simple current group is g ={ , j}, so in particular its orbits [] either have
length two (i.e. have stabilizer s ={ }) or length one (i.e. are xed points, with s = z2).
only elds  with vanishing monodromy charge can be xed points; therefore xed points
cannot give rise to odd boundary conditions.

the even boundary conditions preserve, of course, all bulk symmetries. the relevant bound-
ary blocks eb can therefore be expressed in terms of the boundary blocks of the a-theory as

and the ward identities that come from a eld y in the chiral algebra a look like

eb = 1
|s|

(b  bj) ,

eb  (yn  1 + y 1  yn) = 0

(14.3)

(14.4)

with y = (1)y 1. as for any boundary conditions that preserve all of a, the classifying
algebra c(a) for the even boundary conditions is the fusion algebra of the a-theory, with
structure constants expressible via the verlinde formula in terms of the modular transformation
matrix s of the a-theory.

as established in subsection 9, in the case of odd boundary conditions, the ward identities

(14.4) get replaced by those for twisted boundary blocks; here they read

the odd boundary blocks ob satisfying these constraints are dierences

ob  (yn  1 + y 1  (yn)) = 0 .

ob = b  ( bj)

(14.5)

(14.6)

of the boundary blocks of the a-theory. they are thus related to the ordinary boundary blocks
as in formula (8.20), i.e. we have

where the maps  satisfy the -twisted intertwining property  y = (y )  (which to-
gether with their action on the highest weight vector determines them uniquely).

ob = eb  (  id) ,

(14.7)

14.2 the classifying algebra
let us now display the total classifying algebra c( a) which governs even and odd boundary
conditions simultaneously. we already know what the labels for the basis of c( a) and for its
one-dimensional irreducible representations look like. moreover, in the formula (5.9)a for the
diagonalizing matrix s, in the z2 case only two dierent matrices appear, namely the modular
s-matrix s  s  of the orbifold theory and the matrix s :=sj for the simple current j. the

26

length n of an orbit of j can be either one or two; it will be convenient to use dierent symbols
for labels for xed points and those for length-two orbits; we choose roman letters f, g, ... for
the former and greek letters , , ... from the beginning of the alphabet for the latter. also,
for simplicity we will use one and the same symbol  to refer to a g-character and to its value
on the non-trivial element jg, which can be either of 1. for the subsets of the whole set
i ={} of primary labels of the a-theory that consist of the labels for full orbits and for xed
points we write i and if, respectively, i.e.

i := {  i | n = 2} ,
we also introduce the corresponding subsets

if := {  i | n = 1} .

(14.8)

i := {  i | ={ , j} i} ,

(14.9)
of the label set i of the orbifold theory. with these notations the dimension of c( a) reads
dimc( a) =| i| + 2| if|. by the sum rule (5.22)a this must equal the number of boundary
conditions, i.e. the number of z2-orbits of the a-theory, counted with their stabilizer:

if := { f | (f ,) if}

dim c( a) = 1

2 | i| + 1

2 | i1/2| + 2| if| .

(14.10)

this tells us that for every z2-orbifold the number |i| of length-two q = 0 orbits coincides with
the total number |i1/2| of q = 1/2 orbits. on the other hand the number |if| of xed points,
which necessarily have q = 0, can be arbitrary. also note that dimc(a)|i| =|i| +|if|, i.e.
there are always at least as many even as there are odd boundary conditions. the numbers of
odd and even boundary conditions are equal precisely in those cases where there are no xed
points, which happens precisely when the associated automorphism of the fusion rules is the
identity.

further, the entries of the diagonalizing matrix s read explicitly

s ,[] = 2 s , ,
s ,[g,] = s ,g ,

s( f ,),[] = s f ,
s( f ,),[g,] = 1

for n = 2 ,
2 ( s f ,g +  s f ,g) .

this leads to the formul

n , ,( f ,) = n , , f ,

n , , = 2 n , , ,
n ,( f ,),(g,) = 1
n( f ,),(g,),(h,) = en(f ,),(g,),(h,)

2 ( n , f ,g +  n f , ,g) = en,(f ,),(g,) ,

(14.11)

(14.12)

for the structure constants with three lower indices. here n and en denote the fusion coecients
of the a-theory and of the a-theory, respectively. moreover, we have introduced twined fusion
coecients, dened with the help of the twined s-matrix s, according to

n f ,,g :=xh if

sg,h

s f ,h

s,h
s ,h

27

.

(14.13)

recall from subsection 10.3 that these twined fusion coecients are the traces of the action of
the outer automorphisms associated to j on bundles of chiral blocks.

furthermore, from equation (14.12) we read o that the matrix c b = s st furnishes a con-

jugation on the basis labels (not just an involution as in the generic case). we have

c b

,  = 2  , + ,

c b

,(f ,) = 0 ,

(f ,),(g,) =  f ,g+ cb ( f )
c b

,

;

(14.14)

in particular, conjugation on the xed points is exactly as in the a-theory. it follows that the
structure constants of the classifying algebra read



n

,( f ,) = 1
n

14.3 the individual classifying algebra for odd boundary conditions
the basis { (,) |  i,  s} of the classifying algebra c( a) is mapped by (10.1) to the
distinguished basis of the fusion algebra of the a-theory. in the present situation we nd

e = 1

2 (  + j )

and e(f ,) = ( f ,) .

(14.16)

as we have seen, this provides an algebra homomorphism  from the classifying algebra c( a)
to the fusion algebra of a, which is just the classifying algebra c(a) for the even boundary
conditions, i.e. c(a) = ec( a) = spanc{e}. on the other hand the kernel of  is an ideal of c( a)
which provides us with a classifying algebra oc( a)c()( a) for the odd boundary conditions.
let us analyze this classifying algebra oc( a) in more detail. only g-orbits of length two
contribute. on each such orbit we choose one distinguished representative . we can and
will assume that these choices are made in such a manner that, rst, for the vacuum orbit the
orbifold vacuum  is taken as the representative, and second, on conjugate orbits one chooses
conjugate representatives. then the set of elements

o := 1

2 (   j ) ,

(14.17)

with  the distinguished representative, form a basis for oc( a).
in this basis the structure
constants of oc( a) are given by the following traces on spaces of chiral blocks (which are
integers):
(14.18)

on 

, := n 

,   n j
,  .

as an ideal of c(a), the algebra oc( a) inherits several properties of c(a):
it is semisimple,
commutative and associative; it is unital, the unit element being o =    j; and it has a
conjugation which is evaluation at the unit element. the dimension of oc( a) is

dim oc( a)  |i| = |i1/2| .

(14.19)

28

since oc( a) is semisimple, it must possess a diagonalizing matrix. indeed, by the verlinde

formula for the orbifold fusion rules n 

,  we can write the structure constants (14.18) as

on 

, =xm i

s , m s , m

s , m

( s, m  sj, m) .

(14.20)

here a priori the summation is over all sectors of the orbifold theory. but only the twisted
elds give a non-vanishing contribution, and in that case the two terms with  and j are
equal. labelling these twisted elds by roman letters a, b, ... and calling the corresponding
s, d/ s , d. moreover, elements d on the
index set i1/2, we thus obtain on 
same z2-orbit give identical results, hence we may rewrite this formula as a sum over orbits
d :={ d, j d}. denoting the set of these orbits by i1/2, so that

s , d

s , d

, = 2p d i1/2
i1/2 := {a i | a={a, ja} i1/2} ,
, = 4 xdi1/2

s , d
s , d

on 

s , d

s, d

.

(14.21)

(14.22)

we arrive at

we can interpret this result as stating that the structure constants on are governed by the
matrix os with entries

os,b := 2 s ,b

(14.23)
this is the diagonalizing matrix for oc( a). also note that owing to os,b = 2 s ,b > 0 for all
b i1/2, this matrix shares the positivity property of modular s-matrices (this does not already
follow from the commutativity and semisimplicity of oc( a)). moreover, by combining unitarity
of s with the simple current symmetry sj m,n = (1)2qj(n) s m,n one obtains

with  i, b i1/2 ;

xa i1/2

sa,l

sa, m = 1

2 (l, m  l,j m) , xn i if

sn,l

sn, m = 1

2 (l, m + l,j m) ,

(14.24)

with the help of which one can show that the matrix (14.23) is unitary, which in turn tells us
once again that os is a square matrix.

the structure constants on 

, as dened by (14.18) do depend on the choice of representa-
tives that has been made. indeed, upon replacing  by j, on 
, goes to minus itself. but this
does not change the classifying algebra oc( a), since the choice of a sign constitutes a one-cocycle
on oc( a), which in turn can be absorbed by choosing a correlated sign for the boundary blocks.
more concretely, for the full z2-orbits we have the isomorphism h = h   hj  =h of a-
modules, so that the associated even boundary blocks are precisely eb = b   bj , as given by
formula (14.3), where b m: h m h m+ c are the orbifold boundary blocks. in contrast, there
are two possible choices of odd boundary blocks, namely ob = b   (bj ) as in (14.6) as well
as
(14.25)
by construction both of these linear forms ob and ob on hh+ satisfy the appropriate
ward identities, but of course we must keep just one out of the two. the right prescription is to

ob = bj   (b ) =  ob .

29

keep ob when the label   i is the chosen representative for the orbit   i. (also, positivity
of mixed annulus amplitudes is guaranteed only with this choice, see below.) in short, the label
of the orbifold boundary state that appears with a positive sign in the boundary block (14.6)
is the one that is to be chosen as the representative of the orbit.

14.4 annulus amplitudes

using our general results from section 6 of [1] it is also straightforward to calculate all annulus
amplitudes. for the case of two even boundary conditions we obtain

( n 

, m + n



,j m )  m(it/2) ,

n 
f , m

 m(it/2) ,

a(f ,) (g,) = 1

f

( n

g, m +  n

f

g, m )  m(it/2) .

a 

a (f ,)

= xm i if
= xm i if
2 xm i if

similarly, for two odd boundary conditions the annulus amplitudes are

aa b(t) = 1

2 xm i if

nm ( n a

b, m + n a

b,j m )  m(it/2) .

finally, for mixed annuli, i.e. annuli with one even and one odd boundary, we nd

aa (t) = 1

2 xc i1/2

n ( n a

,c + n a

,jc ) c(it/2) .

(14.26)

(14.27)

(14.28)

thus in particular we correctly establish the z2 selection rule

a

1 2

= 0

whenever qj(1) + qj(2) + qj()  z+1/2 ,

(14.29)

which is analogous to the selection rule that is valid for the orbifold fusion rules.

for every triple 1 2,  the annulus coecient a

is manifestly a non-negative integer ,
in agreement with the physical meaning of the annulus amplitude as a partition function. we
would like to stress that this coecient is not only a non-negative integer, but in addition has
a natural representation theoretic interpretation, namely as the dimension of a space of chiral
blocks. the expressions n
g, m , for example, that appear in the last line of (14.26), are
equal [33] to the ranks of two invariant subbundles of bundles of chiral blocks. this observation
also seems to be relevant for a better understanding of the multiplicities of boundary elds
which are counted by these dimensions (that is, there is a separate boundary eld 1,2;
for
every  = 1, 2, ... , a
) and for which a satisfactory understanding is unfortunately so far still
lacking. inspecting the calculations more closely, one also observes that the coecients ac
a 
check the correctness of the sign convention in the denition of the odd boundary blocks that
was discussed after formula (14.25); with a dierent prescription, some of these coecients
would become negative.

30

with the results above, it is easily veried that the annulus coecients a

satisfy the rela-
tions that are expected on the basis of factorization arguments, 13 i.e. that they are associative
in the sense that

15 examples for involutory boundary conditions

we now present several classes of examples with involutory boundary conditions. we do not
intend to be exhaustive, but concentrate on particularly interesting conformal eld theories.

15.1 dirichlet and neumann conditions for the free boson

a simple and well-known realization of involutory boundary conditions is encountered for the

c = 1 theory of a single free boson, compactied on a circle of radius r =2n , where n is a
positive integer  respectively, at the t-dual radius t(r) = 2/r =p2/n . this theory has 2n
primary elds, which at the chiral level we label by integers  mod 2n ; their u(1) charge modulo
2n is q = /2n . at radius 2n the theory has diagonal torus partition function, i.e. the
primaries are of the form (, ), while for radiusp2/n one deals with the charge conjugation
invariant, i.e. with primaries (,). we will follow our general convention to describe the
boundary conditions for the case of the charge conjugation invariant; the corresponding results
for the diagonal invariant can be deduced via t-duality, as explained in section 11.
the chiral algebra a of the free boson theory consists of operators of the form

where n z and p (x) is a (normally ordered) polynomial in the u(1) current j = ix/2n .

this algebra has an obvious involutory automorphism, which in terms of the fubini--veneziano
eld x is expressed as

13 as already pointed out in subsection 6.5 of [1] for the case of general orbifold group g, a rigorous derivation

p (x) exp(in2n x) ,

of the free boson.

and has the physical meaning of charge conjugation. it maps the u(1) current to minus itself

and exchanges the elds exp(in2n x); thus its xed point algebra consists of the even
polynomials in j combined with the operators cos(n2n x) with n z and odd polynomials
in j combined with sin(n2n x). this algebra a is just the chiral algebra of the z2-orbifold
we recall [32] that this z2-orbifold has n +7 primary elds. first, one has the vacuum 
and a simple current j of conformal weight j = 1, which comes from the u(1) current of the
a-theory. besides these two elds there is one other length-two orbit {1, 2} of monodromy
charge zero (coming from the self-conjugate eld with  =n of the a-theory), as well as n1
xed points  with  = 1, 2, ... ,n1, and nally there is one pair of twisted elds for each of
the two self-conjugate elds of the a-theory, which are denoted by {, } and {, }.
the number of even boundary conditions is equal to the number 2n of primary elds of
the boson theory. according to our general prescription they are labelled by the orbits of the
orbifold and the characters of their stabilizers, i.e. there is one even boundary condition for
each of { , j} and {1, 2} and two for each of the xed points . (in the language of the
circle theory, the latter correspond to the two primary elds of opposite charge .) there
are just two odd boundary conditions, corresponding to the two j-orbits of twisted elds. the
classifying algebra oc( a) for the odd boundary conditions turns out to be just the group algebra
of z2, and the total classifying algebra c( a) is isomorphic to the direct sum of this cz2 and
the fusion rule algebra cz2n of the boson theory.
as is already apparent from (15.2), the odd boundary conditions are nothing but neumann
conditions for the free boson x (with denite rational values of the wilson line), while the
odd ones are dirichlet conditions, with denite rational values of the position of the d0-brane,
namely at r with  any of the 2n th roots of unity. (recall that this formulation refers to
the case where the torus partition function is the charge conjugation invariant; for the true
diagonal invariant, in agreement with t-duality the role of dirichlet and neumann conditions
get interchanged.) the fact that the wilson line (for neumann conditions) respectively the
position of the brane (for dirichlet conditions) are restricted to a discrete set of values is
of course a consequence of the fact that in the situation considered here the preserved bulk
symmetries correspond to a rational conformal eld theory. by breaking more bulk symmetries
one arrives at more general possibilities. in particular, as will be seen in subsection 16.1 below,
one may consider orbifolds that correspond to a change of the radius of the circle and thereby
arrive at wilson lines and brane positions at arbitrary points of the circle.

sl(2) wzw theories

15.2
another example is given by sl(2) wzw theories at levels k  4z. in this case the full conformal
eld theory based on the diagonal modular invariant for the orbifold theory can be realized as
a sigma model on the group manifold su(2), while the diagonal modular invariant for the a-
theory corresponds to a sigma model on the non-simply connected group manifold so(3). in
the usual notation [34] these are the theories labelled ak+1 and dk/2+2, respectively.

the non-trivial simple current jg has conformal weight j = k/4. labelling the sectors
of the ak+1 model by their highest sl(2)-weights and taking as representatives of z2-orbits those

32

with smaller weight, the various label sets look like follows.

i = {0, 2, 4, ... , k
i = {0, 2, 4, ... , k

22, k

2 +2, k

2 +4, ... , k} ,
if = {( k

2 , )|  =1} ,

i1/2 = {1, 3, 5, ... , k1} ,
i1/2 = {1, 3, 5, ... , k
21} .

(15.3)

thus |i| =|i1/2| = k/4 and |if| = 2.
i  iif is

for the modular matrix s  es of the dk/2+2-model, a natural ordering of the labels in
(15.4)

22 , ( k

both for rows and for columns. with this labelling the general formula for the modular s-matrix
of a simple current extension (established in [4] and displayed also in appendix a of [1]) yields

here s is the s-matrix of the ak+1-model, i.e. s, =p2/(k+2) sin((+1)(+1)/(k+2)), and

we introduced the number

i :=( 1

for k  8z ,

i  1 for k  8z + 4 ,

(15.6)

which is nothing but the (one-by-one) matrix sj. in contrast, for the diagonalizing matrix os
of oc( a) there will typically not exist any preferred ordering of the labels   i (for the rows
of os) and a i1/2 (for the columns); amusingly, in the present case it is possible to order rows
and columns in such a fashion that os is symmetric. we have

os,b = 2 s ,b =q 8

k+2 sin ( (+1)(b+1) 
i.e. as  = 0, 2, 4, ... , k/22,
now ordering again i according to the value of the weight,
symmetry is achieved when i1/2 is ordered by taking rst the weights of the form 4j+1
in ascending order and afterwards the weights of the form 4j+3 in descending order, i.e.
a = 1, 5, 9, 13, ...., 15, 11, 7, 3. doing so, the matrix (15.7) simply becomes the matrix with en-

then s is block diagonal of the form

where the symbols |full and |xed stand for restriction of the rows to those corresponding to full
orbits and to xed points, respectively.

15.3 relation with incidence matrices of graphs

in the sl(2) case under consideration, it is not too dicult to establish that  just like the algebra
oc( a)  also the total classifying algebra c( a) constitutes a structure that has been encountered
in conformal eld theory before. indeed, we will construct an isomorphism between c( a) and
an algebra that appears in the work of pasquier et al. to simplify some of the formul below,

2,s is nothing but the
incidence matrix of the graph d2+2. conversely, up to a phase the columns of s are uniquely
determined by the two requirements that s is unitary and diagonalizes n2  with the exception,
however, of the columns numbered +1 and 2+2, which both are eigenvectors to the same
eigenvalue zero. for the latter two columns, in formula (15.14) (unlike in table 2 of [36]) we
have chosen specic linear combinations that are singled out by the property that all structure
constants n t
r,s are non-negative integers. we also remark that the matrix (15.14) is unitary, but

s = n t

it is not symmetric, nor can it be made symmetric by any re-ordering of rows and columns, 14

boundary conditions obey

using the fact that s is symmetric, the result (15.16) tells us that up to normalizations of
the rows of s, transposition, and reordering of the rows and columns, the two matrices s and
s coincide. as all these manipulations can be absorbed into a basis transformation, it follows
that the two algebras that via these matrices are associated to the simple current extension of
sl(2), i.e. the classifying algebra c( a) and pasquiers algebra are isomorphic.
certain submatrices of s become symmetric.

14 however, as follows from the identications below, when combining suitable re-orderings with rescalings,

15.4 virasoro minimal models

the unitary minimal models of the virasoro algebra are labelled by m = 2, 3, ... ; they have
conformal central charge c = cm := 16/(m+1)(m+2). via their realization as a coset theory
sl(2)m1sl(2)1/sl(2)m, the sl(2) wzw situation of the previous subsection gives rise to similar
eects in these minimal models. the requirement that the level must be divisible by four
translates to the condition m 4z (4z+1) on the label m. in these cases the chiral algebra of
the a-theory is obtained from a, which is just the virasoro algebra, via extension by the eld
j with label j = (m, 1) (kac table notation), which has conformal weight j = m(m1)/4.
in these cases we even know that the virasoro algebra a is the only consistent subalgebra of
a, simply because no other unitary conformal eld theories exist at the same value of c. thus
our methods supply us 15 with all conformally invariant boundary conditions of the a-theory.
in particular there are precisely two automorphism types, the even boundary conditions which
preserve the full bulk symmetry a, and the odd boundary conditions which preserve only the
virasoro subalgebra.

the primary elds of the a-theory with central charge cm are labelled by  (r, r) with
(15.23)
modulo the identication (r, r) (m+1r, m+2r), so that there is a total of m(m+1)/2
sectors. we rst look at the cases with m = 4 for some  z>0. then the a- and a-theory are
commonly [34] denoted by (a4, a4+1) and (a4, d2+2), respectively. (in the simplest of these,
obtained for  = 1, the a-theory is the tetracritical ising model (a4, a5) while the a-theory is
the three-state potts model (a4, d4).) we have

1  r  m + 1 ,

1  r  m ,

i = {(r, r)| r = 1, 3, 5, ... , 41, r = 1, 3, 5, ... , 21, 2+3, ... , 4+1} ,
if = {(r, 2+1)| r = 1, 3, 5, ... , 41} ,
i1/2 = {(r, r)| r = 2, 4, 6, ... , 4, r = 2, 4, 6, ... , 4} ,

(15.24)

and hence | i| =| i1/2| = 42, | if| = 2. thus we obtain 2(+2) even and 22 odd boundary
conditions, and hence a total of 4(+1) conformally invariant boundary conditions.

15 at least modulo what goes [39] under the name of complex charges.

36

the similar series with m = 4+1 for  z>0 can be treated analogously. the a- and a-
theory are now known under the names (a4+1, a4+2) and (d2+2, a4+2), respectively. we
have

i = {(r, r)| r = 1, 3, 5, ... , 21, 2+3, ... , 4+1 , r = 1, 3, 5, ... , 4+1 ,
if = {(2+1, r)| r = 1, 3, 5, ... , 4+1 ,
i1/2 = {(r, r)| r = 2, 4, 6, ... , 4 , r = 2, 4, 6, ... , 4+2 ,

(15.25)

so that | i| =| i1/2| = 2(2+1), | if| = 2+1, and the number of even and odd boundary condi-
tions is (2+1)(+2) and (2+1), respectively.
via the coset construction, it is possible to express all the ingredients in the formula for s
through quantities of the underlying sl(2) wzw models, so that again the classifying algebra
c( a) can easily be obtained explicitly. we refrain from displaying any details, which are not too
illuminating. we would like to mention, however, that these results are in perfect agreement
with the ndings of [40, 41].
in the latter papers, various statements were encoded in the
language of graphs; the following remarks allow to make contact to that point of view.

the total number of conformally invariant boundary conditions is

| i| + 2| if| =( 4(+1) = 1

2(+1)(2+1) = 1

2  rank(a4) rank(d2+2)

2  rank(a4+2) rank(d2+2)

for m = 4 ,

for m = 4+1 .

(15.26)

regarding the graphs a4 and d2+2 (i.e. the dynkin diagrams of the respective simple lie
algebras) as bi-colored, starting with (say) a black node, this can be understood as follows.
the even boundary conditions are in one-to-one correspondence with pairs of black nodes from
the product of the two graphs, while odd boundary conditions are in one-to-one correspondence
with pairs of white nodes. mixed pairs of nodes do not correspond to boundary conditions,
which accounts for the factor of 1/2 in (15.26). the latter selection rule may be implemented
by a suitable folding of the a4 graph. the resulting graph has a loop, hence in particular it is
no longer bi-colorable; pairs of nodes from d2+2 and the folded graph are then in one-to-one
correspondence with all conformally invariant boundary conditions, including both even and
odd ones.

further,

let us denote by e(r) the rth exponent of the lie algebra d2+2. for every
r = 1, 2, ... , 2+2, the integer e(r) lies in the label set of the a4+1 graph; indeed, the exponents
correspond precisely to the black nodes of a4+1, with the middle node appearing twice. we
can therefore dene for every s = 1, 2, ... , 4+1 a matrix vs through

(vr) t

s :=xu

s (a)
r,e(u) s (d)

s,u s (d)t,u /s (a)

1,e(u) ,

(15.27)

where s (a) and s (d) are the unitary diagonalizing matrices for the graphs a4+1 and d2+2. thus
s (a) is nothing but the modular s-matrix of the sl(2)4 wzw model. 16 by direct calculation one
checks that the matrices (15.27) furnish a representation of the fusion ring of sl(2)4. further, it
16 on the other hand, the matrix s (d) dened this way is by far not unique; in particular, the incidence
matrix of d2+2 has an eigenvalue with multiplicity 2. for a generic choice of diagonalizing matrix the numbers
n t

r,s (9.6) will not be integral. but [40] there is a unique choice such that these numbers are integral.

37

can be shown that v2 coincides with the incidence matrix of d2+2. by the explicit form of the
sl(2)4 fusion rules, this implies that one may equivalently dene the matrices vs inductively
via v1 := 11, v2 := incidence matrix of d2+2 and

vs := v2vs1  vs2

for s = 3, 4, ... , 4+1 .

(15.28)

one also has the matrix equation

vq nr =xs

(vq) s

(15.29)

for all q = 1, 2, ... , 4+1 and all r = 1, 2, ... , 2+2, where ns are the graph fusion matrices

for r, s, t = 1, 2, ... , 2+2.

in [40,41] also the e-type series of modular invariants for minimal models were discussed in
the framework of graphs, and cyclic groups larger than z2 have been addressed in [42]. it will
certainly be interesting to compare the results obtained there with the ones that can be derived
by the methods of the present paper, and in particular to study how the graph oriented approach
deals with the case of non-cyclic abelian groups, where non-trivial two-cocycles appear.

16 more examples

in this section we present a few further examples, in which the orbifold group g is larger than
z2. we rst discuss two examples of direct relevance to string theory. afterwards we turn to
some specic examples in which the eects of non-trivial two-cocycles can be analyzed in detail.

16.1 general cyclic groups

let us study a situation of immediate interest in which the orbifold group is cyclic and hence
has trivial second cohomology, so that the untwisted and full stabilizers coincide. we start with

the c = 1 theory of a free boson, compactied on a circle of radius r =2n with n  z>0. the
chiral algebra a of this theory consists of operators of the form (15.1). inspection shows that
for every m z>0 there is a subalgebra a(m) of a which is obtained by restricting the value of
n in (15.1) to be a multiple of m. the algebra a(m) is nothing else but the chiral algebra of
another free boson theory, with the free boson x compactied on a circle of radius m2n .

therefore it is a consistent subalgebra in the sense that it allows for the construction of chiral
blocks which obey factorization rules and have a knizhnik--zamolodchikov connection. the
orbifold group is g = zm; its generator acts on an operator of the form (15.1) by multiplication
with the phase exp(2in/m); in terms of the fubini--veneziano eld x this means

x 7 x + 2/(m2n ) .

38

(16.1)

this leaves the u(1) current j invariant and multiplies exp(in2n x) by the phase exp(2in/m).
(together with the automorphism x 7 x (15.2), the transformation (16.1) generates the di-
hedral group dm.)
in this example no xed points are present, so that it is most straightforward to write down
the classifying algebra. the a(m)-theory has 2m2n primary elds, which may be labelled by
integers  mod 2m2n ; their u(1) charge is q = /m2n . the twist sector is determined by
the value of  mod m; in particular, those  = ml which are multiples of m are in the untwisted
sector and label a basis of the classifying algebra c( a(m)). the multiplication in c( a(m)) is just
given by the restriction of the fusion product of the a(m)-theory to the untwisted sector, i.e.

l
n
l,l = l+l+l mod 2mn

.

(16.2)

thus c( a(m)) is the group algebra of the cyclic group zmn . the reection coecients ra
must therefore obey the relation ra
m(l1+l2); , where the addition is modulo 2mn .
the solutions to this requirement are

ml2;  = ra

ml1; ra

; 

ml;  = exp(2imla/2m2n ) = exp(ila/mn )
ra

(16.3)

with a z. moreover, a must be taken only modulo 2mn , and hence the possible values of a
are in one-to-one correspondence with the zm-orbits of the a(m)-theory, in accordance with the
general theory.

this result allows for the following geometric interpretation. after performing a suitable t-
duality transformation, we can assume that we are dealing with a dirichlet boundary condition,
so that we can characterize the boundary state by the position a of a point-like defect on the
circle. breaking the bulk symmetry to the subalgebra a(m) correspond to defects located at
2mn -th roots of unity on the unit circle.
in general, we expect that boundary conditions
breaking more chiral symmetries of the bulk correspond to more generic locations in the space
of boundary conditions.

in the case at hand we can also study explicitly the projective limit of classifying algebras
that was used in the denition of the universal classifying algebra in section 13. manifestly, when
m divides m, then a(m) is a subalgebra of a(m). in more fancy terms this can be expressed
as follows. divisibility introduces a partial ordering on the set i non-negative integers; the
subalgebras a(m) form an inductive system over i. the inductive limit consists just of the
subalgebra a() of uncharged elements of a. moreover, there is a natural projection relating
the classifying algebras:

c( a(m)) = czmn  czmn = c( a(m)) .

there then exists a projective limit

zn := lim


zmn

(16.4)

(16.5)

of the classifying algebras, from which every classifying algebra c( a(m)) can be obtained as a
quotient. the group algebra of the innite group zn is the projective limit of the classifying
algebra. (for n = 1 this group is a well-known object; it appears as the absolute galois group

39

of any nite eld, or as the galois group of the innite extension q(w )/q, where w is the
group of all roots of unity.)

up to this point we were exclusively considering subalgebras that are rational in the sense
that the number of primary elds of the orbifold is nite. when we allow also for boundary
conditions that preserve non-rational subalgebras, then the situation simplies considerably:
a() is then an allowed subalgebra, and the projective limit becomes isomorphic to the group
algebra of z. 17 in this case the irreducible representations of the classifying algebra, and thus
the corresponding boundary conditions, are labelled by the group u(1), the dual group of z.
recall that depending on whether the trivial or the charge conjugation modular invariant has
been chosen in the bulk, the elements of this u(1) group correspond either to values of the
wilson lines or to positions of d0-branes.

16.2 simple current symmetries in string theory

our second example concerns the construction of perturbative superstring theories. such the-
ories contain fermionic degrees of freedom, and one must impose several projections to ob-
tain consistency. all these projections can be formulated in terms of simple currents (see
e.g. [6, 43]). first, one has to impose alignment of the fermionic degrees of freedom; the space-
time fermions, the fermionic degrees of the internal theory and the superghosts have to be
either all in neveu--schwarz or all in the ramond sector. 18 this is accomplished by enlarging
the chiral algebra by all bilinears of the supercurrents of the world sheet theory. we assume
that the theory has a space-time sector containing d free bosons and d free fermions with
a supercurrent jst, which is a simple current of conformal weight  = 3/2 and of order two.
similarly, there are supercurrents jint for the inner sector and jsgh for the superghosts. the
relevant simple current group g is z2  z2, consisting of the identity and the three non-trivial
currents
(16.6)

(jst, 1, jsgh) and (1, jint, jsgh) .

(jst, jint, 1) ,

this extension ensures supersymmetry of the world sheet theory. boundary conditions that
break this symmetry seem to be unacceptable, since they would spoil the consistency of the
theory; they lead to a tachyonic spectrum and other undesired features. these remarks refer
to world sheet supersymmetry and hence apply to all string theories built from n = 1 super-
conformal eld theories.

when we have superconformal theories with extended n = 2 superconformal symmetry on
the world sheet, another simple current extension allows to build space-time supersymmetric
theories. to this end one imposes the gso projection, which can be achieved by enlarging the
chiral algebra by another integer spin simple current jgso. this simple current jgso implements
the spectral ow in the world sheet theory (see e.g. [6, 43]); it has non-trivial components both
in the space-time and in the superghost sector. the order m of jgso is essentially the common
denominator of the u(1) charges in the ramond sector; thus it depends on the specic n = 2
model under consideration.

17 this might look confusing at rst sight; but indeed the projective limit does depend on the category in

which it is taken, i.e. on the selection of the objects  here boundary conditions  one considers.

18 for a discussion of boundary states in the (super-)ghost sector, see e.g. [44].

jgso can be described more explicitly as follows. the u(1) current

inner sector; it can be expressed in terms of a standard free boson as j =pc/3 ix  5 ix.

of the n = 2 algebra is the sum of a component jst in the space-time sector and jint in the
the spectral ow simple current is then realized as the ramond ground state exp(i(5/2)x) of
conformal weight  = 5/8. it has to be combined with its counterpart in the superghost sector.
expressing the superghost in terms of a free boson , the spectral ow operator is exp(i/2)
which has conformal weight 5/8, so that the total simple current
2 (z))

(16.8)

jgso = exp(i

5
2 x(z)) exp(i 1

has integral conformal weight. in total, the projections in the construction of a superstring
theory require a simple current extension by the abelian group

z2  z2  zm .

(16.9)

in this extension typically xed points do occur, as well as untwisted stabilizers that dier from
the full stabilizers.

in contrast to the situation with supersymmetry on the world sheet, it is denitely of
interest to study boundary conditions that do not preserve all space-time supersymmetries.
a particular example is given by bps conditions, but our formalism allows to describe also
boundary conditions in which all space-time supersymmetries are broken. for reviews of non-
bps states and their conformal eld theory description, we refer to [45, 46].

let us mention that the formalism developed in the present work has another application
in string theory. namely, every superconformal eld theory with n = 2 supersymmetry has an
automorphism of order two that reverses the sign of the u(1) current j of the n = 2 algebra
and exchanges the two supercurrents g of charge 1. accordingly, when studying boundary
conditions that correspond to this automorphism we get two automorphism types; they are
usually called a-type and b-type (see e.g. [47]). according to the general results in section
11, t-duality interchanges these two automorphism types. notice that both types of boundary
conditions are encompassed by a single classifying algebra.

16.3 the z2 orbifold of the free boson and fractional branes

another illustrative example for our formalism is provided by the z2-orbifold of a free boson,
compactied at a rational radius squared. for concreteness, we again restrict our attention to
the case when r2 = 2n with n  z>0, which corresponds to the diagonal modular invariant.
the boundary conditions that preserve all bulk symmetries are in one-to-one correspondence
to the labels of primary elds, for which we will use the convention of [32]. these boundary
conditions can be given the following interpretation.

in the untwisted sector of the orbifold there are n1 primaries q, q = 1, 2, ... ,n1, of
conformal weight q = q2/4n , as well as two pairs 1, j (of conformal weight 0 and 1) and 1, 2
(with  =n /4) which each combine to a single primary eld of the underlying circle theory.
the boundary conditions labelled by the q constitute d0-branes sitting at r with  one of the

41

2n th roots eiq/n , 0 < q <n , of unity; those labelled by 1 and j describe d0-branes which are
both localized at one orbifold point, and those labelled by 1 and 2 are d0-branes localized
at the other orbifold point. the latter boundary conditions deserve particular attention, as
in these cases the position in target space is not sucient to describe uniquely the boundary
conditions. rather, an additional discrete label is needed. now the primary elds 1, j, 1 and
2 have quantum dimension 1, while the primaries q all have quantum dimension 2. it is also
known that in a string compactication the ramond--ramond charge is proportional to certain
(generalized) quantum dimensions. thus we can conclude that the d-branes sitting at orbifold
points have a ramond--ramond charge that is only half the one of d-branes sitting at smooth
points; accordingly [48] they are referred to as fractional branes.

in terms of boundary states (or, equivalently, reection coecients) this behavior is ex-
plained as follows. for boundary conditions that preserve the full bulk symmetry, the reec-
tion coecients are (ratios of) elements of the modular matrix s. the pairs 1, j and 1, 2
form full orbits of the order-two simple current j, while the elds q are xed points of j.
since the monodromy charge with respect to j is 0 for elds in the untwisted sector and 1/2
in the twisted sector, the standard simple current relation sj, = e2iqj ()s, implies that in
the boundary conditions labelled by q boundary blocks of the twisted sector do not appear.
indeed, because of jq = q we have sq,  sjq, =sq, for all  in the twisted sector.
in
contrast, orbits of full length do appear, but with opposite sign for the two primaries  and j
on the orbit. briey, the ambiguity for boundary conditions that are localized at the orbifold
points reects the fact that on a disk with such a boundary condition bulk elds in the twisted
sector can acquire a non-vanishing one-point function and that two values with opposite sign
are possible for this correlation function.

the twisted sector contributes four more primaries 1,2 and  1,2 of conformal weight 1/16 and
9/16, respectively. it turns out that the corresponding boundary conditions are not localized
and are thus neumann-like. it is therefore tempting to identify them with the four dierent
types of z2-equivariant line bundles over the circle.

to gain insight in symmetry breaking boundary conditions, we need consistent subalgebras
a of the chiral algebra a of the z2-orbifold. examples are easily obtained by observing that the
vector space that underlies the chiral algebra a can be decomposed according to the absolute
value of the u(1) charge in the circle theory. this quantity is well-dened because we only have
to deal with elds in the untwisted sector and only states with opposite charge are identied.

in the decomposition all multiples of n appear:
h = mnz0

hu(1)
nn

.

(16.10)

this decomposition does not constitute a grading of a over the additive group z0, because
the fusion structure within the chiral algebra reads [q1]  [q2] = [q1+q2] + [|q1q2|]. still these
fusions imply that for every integer  2 the subspace
hu(1)
nn

(16.11)

 := mnz0
h()

provides a subalgebra of the chiral algebra, and it is in fact a consistent subalgebra because it
is nothing but the chiral algebra of the z2-orbifold of a free boson at radius r() = r.

42

moreover, inspection shows that, except for  = 2, we are not dealing with an orbifold
subalgebra ag of a. indeed, for  3 there does not exist any automorphism of a for which
the xed point set is h()
 . (note that for generic n the orbifold theory also has very few
automorphisms of the fusion rules that preserve the conformal weights.) in particular, this
situation is not covered by our formalism. however, the specic conformal eld theory in
question is simple enough to allow for a direct construction of the corresponding boundary
states [49]. they are not related to automorphisms of the chiral algebra, and thus it is in
general not possible to associate an automorphism type to such boundary conditions. hence
they provide a simple counter example to the common misconception that every boundary
condition should possess a denite automorphism type.

in the particular case  = 2, our techniques can be applied to obtain still more boundary
conditions. we denote primary elds in the orbifold theory at radius r := 2r by analogous
labels as above, with an additional bar. the boundary conditions then correspond to orbits of
primaries with respect to the simple current 1, which has order two. we only describe the
orbits of non-trivial automorphism type. the orbits { q, 4nq} for q = 1, 3, ... , 2n1 give
d0-branes localized at r times a 4n th root of unity that is not a 2n th root of unity. from the
other orbits in the untwisted sector of the a-theory we recover the other boundary conditions
in the untwisted sector that were described earlier. in the twisted sector of the a-theory we
nd two orbits that are xed points, 1 and  1; they give rise to four boundary conditions
that preserve all bulk symmetries, corresponding to 1,2 and  1,2 in the a-theory. finally, the
remaining orbit {2,  2} gives rise to a neumann-like boundary condition which breaks the
symmetries down to h(2)
 .
we conclude our discussion with the remark that, unlike for the free boson case, the auto-
morphism type of a boundary condition in the z2-orbifold of a free boson does not allow any
longer to distinguish dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions. still, all dirichlet boundary
conditions come from the untwisted sector while all neumann boundary conditions come from
the twisted sector.

16.4 examples with genuine untwisted stabilizer

we now consider in detail an example where an untwisted stabilizer occurs that is a proper
subgroup of the full stabilizer. it is worth emphasizing that the situation with genuine untwisted
stabilizers arises rather naturally in string compactications. this is a consequence of the
following elementary fact that applies to any tensor product of three or more subtheories
with three simple currents ji (i = 1, 2, 3) of half-integral conformal weight in three distinct
subtheories. in the gepner construction of superstring vacua such subtheories can be factors
in the inner sector, but also the conformal eld theories describing space-time fermions or
the (super-)ghosts. generic examples for simple currents with  z+1/2 are the various
components of the supercurrent on the world sheet, but typically in such compactications
other simple currents of this type are present as well.

it has been shown in [4] that in wzw theories the commutator cocycle obeys

where j is the conformal weight of j, while (k)

j

is the conformal weight of the projection of

f(j, k) = exp(2i(j  (k)

j

)) ,

(16.12)

43

j in what is called the xed point theory [6] with respect to k. this formula also applies to
those simple currents of coset theories which come from simple currents of the underlying wzw
models. 19 in the situation at hand, each of the simple currents ji is projected to the identity
primary eld of the xed point theory, so that (16.12) implies that f(ji, ji) =1. on the other
hand, for i6= j the two currents are elds in distinct subtheories, so that f(ji, jj) = 1. now
out of the three currents ji we can form three simple currents ji of the tensor product theory
by setting j1 := j2j3 and cyclic. these have integral conformal weight and hence  unlike the
original currents ji themselves  can be used to extend the chiral algebra, by a z2z2 group.
by the bihomomorphism property of f we then see that f is non-trivial on this group:

f(ji, jj) =(cid:26) 1 for i = j ,

1 for i6= j .

(16.13)

as a consequence, the untwisted stabilizer is a proper subgroup of the full stabilizer.

we will now study the eect of a non-trivial untwisted stabilizer in the situation that the
a-theory is a wzw theory, based on some ane lie algebra g = g(1) and that the orbifold
theory is a wzw theory as well, now based on g = g(1) with g  g. such wzw orbifolds have
been studied in [50, 5]. here we are interested in conformally invariant boundary conditions.
thus the virasoro algebras of g and g must coincide; this is precisely the case when g  g is
a conformal embedding [51, 52].
many, though not all, conformal embeddings can be understood in terms of simple currents.
an example where this is possible is the following. for any three odd positive integers d1, d2, d3
there is a conformal embedding

g := so(d1)1  so(d2)1  so(d3)1  so(d1+d2+d3)1 =: g .

(16.14)

the theory based on g can be obtained as an extension of the g-theory by a simple current
group g = z2  z2, consisting of the elds
(o,v,v) ,

(v,o,v) and (v,v,o) ,

(o,o,o) ,

(16.15)

where o and v refer to the singlet and vector representation of so(di), respectively. there is only
a single xed point, namely the tensor product (s,s,s) of three so(di) spinor representations;
it has stabilizer s =g. the conformal weight of the vector simple current v at level 1 is 1/2;
according to the general arguments presented at the beginning of this subsection, the untwisted
stabilizer is therefore trivial, u ={(o,o,o)}. (the value [s :u] = 22 of the index is in agreement
with the fact that the ground state degeneracy of the irreducible spinor representation of the
so(d1+d2+d3) theory is twice as large as the one of (s,s,s), namely 2 2(d11)/22(d21)/22(d31)/2.)
as a side remark, we mention that these theories can be realized in terms of free fermions.
thus the eect of a genuine untwisted stabilizer can occur even in free conformal eld theories.
this is in fact not too surprising. as we have explained, the presence of untwisted stabilizers
is related to the fact that the orbifold group acts only projectively on certain sectors of the
theory; this is also known [32] to be true for the action of the three polyhedral groups on the
free boson (compactied at the self-dual radius) that gives rise to the exceptional c = 1 theories.

19 in coset theories there can, however, exist additional simple currents which arise from resolving xed points

with integral quantum dimension.

44

in the case at hand, the relevant automorphisms of the chiral algebra a can be understood
in terms of the nite-dimensional lie groups g and g associated to g and g. namely, for every
boundary block b: hh+ that preserves the full bulk symmetry and every element   g the
combination b()
 := b  (  id) provides us with a twisted boundary block. the corresponding
automorphism on the ane lie algebra g is the inner automorphism that acts on the modes
n 7 (j a1)n. this automorphism preserves the symmetries in the subalgebra g
n of g as j a
j a
if and only if  is in the centralizer cg(g) of g in g, and it acts trivially if and only if  is
even in the center z(g) of g. thus the non-trivial twists are those by elements in the group
cg(g)/z(g).

in the case of our interest, the relevant embedding on the level of lie groups reads

g := (spin(d1) spin(d2) spin(d3))/(z2  z2)  spin(d1+d2+d3) =: g ;

(16.16)

note that the subgroup g is not simply connected. for determining cg(g)/z(g) it is instructive
to consider rst the embedding

g := so(d1) so(d2) so(d3)  so(d1+d2+d3) =: g

(16.17)

that is obtained from (16.16) by dividing out the center of spin(d1+d2+d3). then the center
of the g is trivial; moreover, using the matrix realization of these groups, one shows that the
centralizer cg(g) is a z2  z2 group consisting of the unit matrix 11d1+d2+d3 and the diagonal
matrices

m23 :=

11d1
0
0 11d2
0

0
0
0 11d3

 ,

m13 :=

11d1 0

0

 ,

m12 :=

0

11d1
0
0 11d2 0
11d3
0

0

 .

(16.18)

already at this stage we can conclude that the centralizer cg(g) is an extension of this z2  z2
group by the center z2 of spin(d1+d2+d3). to decide which extension we are dealing with, we
introduce gamma matrices i that satisfy the cliord relations {i, j} = 2 ij. we can then
determine the two lifts mij of the matrices mij to spin(d1+d2+d3) from the requirement that
m12i(m12)1 =i for 1 i d1+d2 and m12i(m12)1 = i for i > d1 +d2. it is easy to verify
that

m12 =  12    d1+d2 ,
m13 =  12    d1 d1+d2+1    d1+d2+d3 .

m23 =  d1+1d1+2    d1+d2+d3 ,

(16.19)

it can be checked that these matrices commute with all elements in g. they form a group of
order 8; the structure of this group depends on the values of d1, d2 and d3. first, when all di
leave the same rest modulo 4z, then the group is isomorphic to the eight-element generalized
quaternion group; this group has one two-dimensional and four one-dimensional irreducible
representations. otherwise, i.e. when only two of the di leave the same rest modulo 4z, the
group is isomorphic to the dihedral group d4 of 8 elements. this group has four one-dimen-
sional and one two-dimensional irreducible representation, too. in both cases the centralizer is
non-abelian.

let us present some more details. the boundary blocks are labelled by the elds of mon-
odromy charge zero and characters of their (full) stabilizers; thus there are 8 boundary blocks

45

coming from full orbits; we label them lexicographically,

b1 := booo ,
b5 := bvoo ,

b2 := boov ,
b6 := bvov ,

b3 := bovo ,
b7 := bvvo ,

b4 := bovv ,
b8 := bvvv .

(16.20)

note that the blocks numbered as 1, 4, 6, 7 come from the vacuum of the a-theory, while the
others come from the eld that carries the vector representation of so(d1+d2+d3). in addition
we have 4 boundary blocks coming from the xed point (s,s,s). they correspond to the four
irreducible characters  of z2  z2; we label them as

b9 := b++++ ,

b10 := b++ ,

b11 := b++ ,

b12 := b++ ,

(16.21)

where the  labels indicate the values 1 of  on the four elements of z2  z2, in the lexico-
graphic order chosen in formula (16.15).
the boundary conditions are labelled by the orbits and characters of their untwisted stabi-
lizers. thus in addition to the three boundary conditions that preserve all of a, there are three
conditions from the length-4 orbits and two conditions for each of the three length-2 orbits
which have stabilizer z2. we label them according to

b1 = {(ooo) , (ovv) , (vov) , (vvo)} ,
b2 = {(oov) , (ovo) , (voo) , (vvv)} ,
b3 = {(sss)} ,
b4 = {(soo) , (sov) , (svo) , (svv)} ,
b5 = {(oso) , (osv) , (vso) , (vsv)} ,
b6 = {(oos) , (ovs) , (vos) , (vvs)} ,

b7 = {(oss) , (vss)} with  = 1 ,
b8 = {(oss) , (vss)} with  =1 ,
b9 = {(sos) , (svs)} with  = 1 ,
b10 = {(sos) , (svs)} with  =1 ,
b11 = {(sso) , (ssv)} with  = 1 ,
b12 = {(sso) , (ssv)} with  =1 .

with this numbering, the diagonalizing matrix s looks as follows:

is non-vanishing, which are precisely those cases where after division by 2 these numbers furnish
a character of z2z2.
let us now add some general remarks. every g-module can be decomposed into irre-
ducible modules of the product cg(g) g. the fact that the group cg(g) is non-abelian
implies that it has higher-dimensional irreducible representations, which in turn means that
higher-dimensional degeneracy spaces appear; this way we recover a generic feature of genuine
untwisted stabilizers. conversely, we are led to the following conjecture. let g  g be an
embedding of reductive compact lie groups such that the associated embedding of ane lie
algebras is a simple current extension. then the centralizer cg(g) is non-abelian if and only if
at some value of the level a genuine untwisted stabilizer appears. for instance, there is a con-
formal embedding (d4)2  (e7)1 which again is a simple current extension by a z2z2 group.
as e7 is an exceptional lie algebra, the relevant centralizer, namely the one of so(8)/z2 in e7,
is now dicult to compute, but in any case the analysis of the boundary conditions indicates
that this centralizer is non-abelian. for completeness, we mention that in the e7 case there are
eight boundary conditions preserving the ane d4 subalgebra, and the matrix s reads

s =

on the other hand, the automorphisms themselves are classied by the group cg(g)/z(g),
which in both cases considered above is z2  z2. thus they precisely correspond to the auto-
morphism types that are predicted by the general analysis.
