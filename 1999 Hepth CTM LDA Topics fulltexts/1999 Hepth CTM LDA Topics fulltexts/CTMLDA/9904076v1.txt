abstract

by solving the ward identities in a superconformal eld theory
we nd the unique three-point greens functions composed of chiral
superelds for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 supersymmetry. we show that the n = 1
four-point function with r-charge equal to one is uniquely determined
by the ward identities up to the specication of four constants. we
discuss why chiral greens functions above three-points, with total
r-charge greater than n , are not uniquely determined.

1 introduction

the symmetries of maxwells classical equations have played a dening role
in modern physics. their importance for relating observers which moved at
constant velocity with respect to each other was realised by lorentz, prior to
the development of special relativity by einstein in 1905. their gauge sym-
metry was discovered by weyl in the 1920s and was extended to construct
the standard model in 1967, however, it is only more recently that the true
importance of electromagnetic duality and conformal invariance has become
apparent. in fact, the conformal invariance of the classical maxwell equa-
tions was realised as long ago as 1909 [1]. unfortunately, quantum eects in
maxwells theory coupled to electrons and in all other four-dimensional the-
ories which were subsequently studied for many years, lead to violations of
their conformal symmetries. the corresponding anomaly is directly related
to the appearance of innities in quantum eld theory. despite this, in the
1960s and 1970s there was a revival of interest in four dimensional confor-
mal symmetry [2] and it was found that the two and three point greens
functions could be determined up to constants by conformal symmetry [3].
with the discovery of supersymmetry, examples of conformally invariant four
dimensional quantum eld theories were found. the rst such example [4]
being the n = 4 yang-mills theory. subsequently, it was realised that there
were an innite number of n = 2 theories [5] and even some n = 1 theories
[6]. more recently other examples of conformally invariant supersymmetric
theories have been found [7].

supersymmetric theories are most naturally formulated in terms of super-
elds, since only then is their supersymmetry manifest and, as a result, can
their quantum properties be most systematically studied. however, the su-
perelds which describe physical quantities are always subject to constraints.
for example, the wess-zumino model and the eld strengths of n = 1 and
n = 2 yang-mills theory are described by chiral superelds. in fact, these
constraints, which imply that these superelds in eect live on only a sub-
space of the usual minkowski superspace, are directly responsible for the well
known non-renormalisation theorems in supersymmetric theories [8]. as a
result of the pattern found when calculating the chiral greens functions in
two dimensional n = 2 superconformal minimal models [9] it was proposed
that the constraints on the superelds when combined with superconformal
invariance could also lead to results in four dimensions which were stronger
than those that were generically found in conformally invariant, but non-
supersymmetric theories. the rst such result was the realisation that the
relation between the r-weight and the dilation weight of any chiral supereld
could be used to determine its dilation weight in a superconformal theory [11].

2

in reference [12] the chiral ward identities for any n were given and it was
shown that there were no superconformal chiral invariants. in a subsequent
series of papers [13] it was also realised that theories that involved harmonic
superelds, such as n = 4 yang-mills theory would have very strong con-
straints placed on them as a result of their superconformal invariance.

an early dicussion of three-point functions in n = 1 superconformal
theories appears in reference [10]. in reference [11] an expression for the three-
point greens function for n = 1 chiral superelds was given. unfortunately,
this expression was not correct and was subsequently corrected by the authors
of the present paper in the thesis of reference [14]. although the work in this
thesis was made available to some workers, and some of its results were
reviewed in reference [15], it is not available to most workers in the eld. a
discussion of the superconformal group was given in references [16], [17] and
[18]. in this paper we give some of the results of reference [14] and extend
them by calculating the most general expression for the three-point chiral
greens function for any n. the result can be succinctly summarised as

additionally, we show that [14], contrary to nave expectations, this does
not in general imply that the chiral greens functions higher than three-
points are determined up to constants. in fact, as a direct consequence of
the nilpotent properties of these greens functions, we nd that we can not
uniquely determine any solution above three-points when the total r-charge
of the greens function, denoted by q0, is greater than one. however, in the
particular case when q0 = 1, we nd that the n = 1 four-point solution is
uniquely specied up to four constants by the superconformal ward identities
and we show how to construct the appropriate solution once these constants
have been specied.

2 general properties of solutions

as discussed in reference [12], the superconformal ward identities for transla-
tions, dilations and special conformal transformations acting on chiral greens
functions, g, are

in the above equations the sum is over p, however, this index is suppressed on
the coordinates and on q. we have used the shorthand notation   =

and i =

ward identity

(11)

to begin with, we consider the case n = 1, where eq. (7) is trivially
realised since e is zero. it is well known that the solution of the constraint
in eq. (2) implies that the greens functions are functions of the dierences
s 
pq only, where q = p + 1. this is easy to see if we consider our independent
variables to be the dierences s 

pq , where q = p + 1, along with the sum

(12)

clearly, any function of s 
p can be written in terms of these variables instead.
it follows from the chain rule that, for any greens function g obeying eq. (2),
we may write

(13)

and the result follows.

a similar argument shows that the same is true for the 

p variables.

we see that

(14)

(15)

and thus g is independent of  from eq. (5).

given these simplications, one might wonder whether any of the other
operators in the algebra may be expressed as the derivative of a single variable
by a suitable choice of independent variables.
in particular, we consider
eq. (8), as it has a very simple form. we use the fact that g is a function of
p,p+1 only, and as a result, we may use the chain rule to write s 
s 
p,p+1 and 
as

s  =

(17)

for some variable 0 , which must be a function of s 
we also have

for some variables pq . comparing this with eq. (16) we nd

clearly, one can write any function of s

p,p+1 and 

p,p+1 in terms s 

p,p+1, 0 

 

pqr =  

pq   
qr.

(22)

from eq. (21), g is independent of 0  and must therefore be a function
of the remaining independent variables, namely the pqr  and the s 
p,p+1. in
summary, any arbitrary function, g( 
pq ), obeys equations (2), (5) and
(8), which leaves the ward identities (3), (4), (6), (9) and (10) to be solved.

3 a particular three-point solution

in the case of the three-point function, we see immediately from the above
that there is only one independent spinor, namely  
123. we can see that a
solution proportional to  
123 alone is not possible even if we consider non-
scalar solutions. the general form of such a solution would have to be

g

3 =  

123 h (spq).

(23)

6

the action of q  on this function yields two linearly independent terms,
which can each be set to zero using the ward identity in (6). these are :

23  23  (cid:16)s1

23

 h (cid:17) = 0,
 h (cid:17) = 0,

(24)

(25)

from which it is clear that h  = 0, and thus there is no solution of this form.
for now, we restrict our attention to scalar solutions and deduce that the

scalar three-point greens function must be of the form

g3 =

in this case, eq. (26) shows that q0 = 1 is the only possibility. one can then
see by inspection that the dilation operator d constrains f to be of degree
2 in s 
pq .

consider next the ward identity of eq. (6). this includes the action of

the operator q  on g3, which gives

c = s2

where we have used the shorthand notation

(s12.s23) = s 

12 s23 .

(29)

(30)

this follows from the equations (133) and (134) given in appendix ap-
pendix b, which can be used to reduce any scalar expression at 3 points
to a function of a, b and c. using this we can rewrite eq. (28) as

this implies that f is a function of degree 1 in a, b, c (i.e. degree 2 in s12
and s23), which we know already from the dilation operator d. so, in this
case q  does not give any new constraints on f .

without loss of generality, the function f (a, b, c) may be considered as an
arbitrary function of degree 0 multiplied by any particular function of degree
1 in its arguments, with numerator 1. let us choose this function to be
1/s2
13. any degree zero function is in general a function of two independent
ratios of a, b and c, such as (a + 2b + c)/a and c/a. thus, we may write g3
as

g3 =

which is the most general solution to equations (2), (3), (5), (6), (8) and
(10), for a scalar three point function.

we will nd the most general chiral greens function in section 4, how-
ever, as a step in this direction we will now show that we can choose f  = 1,
and show by explicit calculation that g3 is also a solution to eq. (9), and
so all the superconformal ward identities. the full calculation is too long
to reproduce here, however, we note that whilst g has to be a function of
the dierences in the coordinates, i.e. s 
p,p+1, the ward identity of
eq. (9) involves s g, which is not.

p,p+1 and 

s g3 can therefore be expressed in terms of coecients of

from the superconformal algebra, we know that k   is related to the

that equations (8) and (9) together imply eq. (4). thus,

g0

13

(36)

is a solution to all of the n = 1 ward identities, given eq. (35). recall
that we arbitrarily chose the function f  to be 1 when proving that the
superconformal ward identities are satised. of course for a specic set of r
charges, and so dilation weights, the three-point function must be unique as
a consequence of the standard results of ordinary conformal eld theory. as
such, for the charges of eq. (35) this result is the unique result. in section 4,
and using the results of section 3, we will give a superspace proof of this fact
and then nd the unique three-point chiral greens function for all possible
r charges.

4 conditions for uniqueness of greens func-

tions

a standard argument to establish the uniqueness of greens functions goes
as follows. consider two greens functions, g1 and g2. their ratio, r, will

9

satisfy all the ward identities with no isotropy transformations and so will
be an invariant. if however, one can prove that there are no invariants then
one can establish the uniqueness.
if we were to apply this argument for
the case of chiral greens functions considered in this paper, then we would
nd that eq. (10) implies r is independent of 
pq. from this, it follows that
eq. (6) implies r must be independent of s 
pq as well, and hence simply a
constant. this might, at rst sight, appear to suggest that all the chiral
greens functions were unique. such an argument was suggested in the rst
version of reference [12].

in fact, eq. (10) implies that r is of degree zero in 

pq, but the greens
functions are proportional to some power of 
pq and so are nilpotent. it is of
course not correct to divide by nilpotent quantities. nonetheless, one might
hope that one could in eect still arrive at the correct result. however, we
note that the above argument does not require s-supersymmetry and we
have already shown by explicit construction, that the solution to the ward
identities in the absence of (9) is not unique ( even at three points). therefore
the above uniqueness argument must be incorrect.

to see why, we should ask the related question: if g1 is a greens func-
tion, does there exist another of the form g2 = r(s 
pq )g1 ? this is equivalent
to studying the ratio r, except that no division has occurred. r has to be
independent of 
pq or otherwise g2 will not satisfy ward identities with the
same value q0 as g1, which it must do by hypothesis.

as usual, we deduce from eq. (2) that r is a function of the dierences,
s 
p,p+1, and from eq. (3), that r must be of degree zero. equations (5), (8)
and (10) are trivially realised on g2. from eq. (6), we deduce

q g2 = g1 q r = 0.

(37)

this does not imply that q r = 0, because g1 is a function of grassmann odd
variables. considering our explicit form of g3, we see that it is the square of
the spinor  
123 then g2 could obey eq. (6).
however, q r would be non-zero and thus r would be dependent on s 
pq ,
violating the uniqueness argument.

123. if q r was proportional to  

by denition, we take r to be independent of  and to be a scalar, and
the dilation ward identity implies that it is of of degree 0 in sp,p+1. we now
show that, when acted on by q , any scalar function of degree zero in spq
becomes a function of pqr .

to see this, note that any scalar function of s 

p,p+1 can be written in terms
of (sp,p+1.sq,q+1). this is because a scalar is a trace of a product of s 
p,p+1
and, in order to take the trace of such a term, one must have an even number

10

of s 

p,p+1. for example, one can write

s2
pq = (spq.spq)
(spq.srs) = (spq.srs)

(sp.sq.sr.st) = (sp.sq)(sr.st)

(38)

hence every scalar can be written as the trace of a product of terms of the
form (sp,p+1.sq,q+1). furthermore, a scalar expression of degree 0 can always
be written in terms of expressions of the form :

(sp,p+1.sq,q+1)

s2
p,p+1

.

therefore, all we need to do is establish the required result for all expressions
of the form

(sp,p+1.sq,q+1)

s2
p,p+1

and it automatically follows for all scalars by using leibniz rule for rst order
linear dierential operators.

direct calculation shows that

q " (spq.srs)

s2
pq

# = (cid:16)


pqr + 



qrs(cid:17) spq srs 

s2
pq

! ,

(39)

and thus any function of degree zero is a function of terms of the form pqr 
when acted on by q . using the relations given in appendix appendix b
we can see that pqr  can always be written in terms of the basis set of
functions a,(a+1),(a+2) . this means that q k can in principle be non-zero
and the solution to the ward identities, excluding eq. (9) and eq. (4), is not
necessarily unique. in particular, at three points q r is simply proportional
to 123 , and therefore g3 q r vanishes for any r of degree zero, not just
constant values.

in order to pursue the question of uniqueness, we must therefore consider
the eect of either k   or s on a given greens function, g1. these operators
are not independent, as seen from the algebra, and thus we need to consider
only one of them. we choose k   for reasons which will become clear below.
k   is the sum of a part, k  
0 , which is rst order in dierential operators
and so obeys the leibniz rule and a multiplicative operator, k  
, which
contains the isotropy group action. these two parts are given by

g2. dening q1 to be the r weight of the greens function g1, we have the
equation

k  g1 = k  

0 g1 + k  

q1 g1

and thus, writing

= 0,

q2 = q1 + q

we deduce that, for g2 to be a greens function, we must have

k  g2 = g1(cid:16)k

(45)

we note that unlike q r, k  r is independent of 

pq since r is indepen-
pq and so the  dependent terms in k   do not act. it is for this
dent of 
reason that we chose to investigate the action of k   in contrast to s. as
a result, we may demand

from which it follows that (see appendix appendix b for notation)

k  (s1.s2.s3.s4)

6= 0

(51)

(52)

(53)

since otherwise, choosing s3 = s4, would give a contradiction with eq. (52).
this accounts for all scalar expressions and we must therefore construct the
function, r, from products of s2
pq, and ensure that it is of degree zero. for such
functions, k  
q r, and thus we may nd a non-vanishing
r such that

0 r is of the form k  

k  r = k  

0 r + k  
q r

= 0,

(54)

for a suitable choice of q.

if we restrict our attention to the explicitly known three-point solution,
given in equations (36) and (35), then we see that since no three-point purely
conformal invariant exists, it must be unique once the r charges q of the
chiral greens function are specied. however, there are an innite number
of solutions which have distinct q. we can generate a new greens function
from an existing one simply by multiplying by a degree zero function of s2
pq,
where there is no restriction on p or q. at three-points, the new greens
function is a solution to a set of ward identities with the appropriate r
charges. thus, uniqueness survives at the three-point level, but only by
virtue of the standard uniqueness of any conformal three-point function. it
is is not due to the chirality of the greens function.

13

in contrast, one can generate a four-point solution by multiplying together

two three-point solutions, with dierent

g4 = r(s2

pqr. we have

2
234
s2
24

,

(55)

for some choice of q. this follows from the three point results for the leibniz
parts of the dierential operators, and the remaining terms coming from the
isotropy group action can be made to vanish by choosing q suitably. in this
case, q0 = 2. for the particular case of r = 1, we deduce from our knowledge
of the three-point solution that

2q1 = q2 = q3 = 2q4 =

2
3

.

(56)

however, as seen from the above discussion, uniqueness depends on the
existence of an ordinary conformal n-point function, i.e. one which obeys
k  
0 r = 0. it is well known from ordinary conformal theory that such invari-
ants exist, e.g. the independent cross ratios

u =

s2
12s2
34
s2
13s2
24

,

v =

s2
23s2
14
s2
13s2
24

.

(57)

the fact that these are conformal invariants is easily seen from eq. (49).

if r is a function of u, v, then eq. (47) is valid when q = 0. thus, for
four-points and above, there exist distinct greens functions, g1 and g2, which
are solutions to precisely the same ward identities, and thus they are not
unique. given eq. (56), we may write the corresponding four point solution
as

g4 = r(u, v)

2
123
2s2
13

2
234
s2
24

,

(58)

where r(u, v) is completely arbitrary.

123 and  

this result can be traced directly to the nilpotence of  

234. in
particular, when either of these spinors is raised to the third power they
vanish. thus, one might attempt to nd unique solutions, for a given q0, by
restricting the value of q0 to 1, and thus ruling out the possibility of this eect.
whilst such solutions may well exist, uniqueness is still not guaranteed. in
the case where q0 = 1, the solution may be of the form 2, where   is some
linear combination of the pqr . if   were found to be equal to q h, where
h was some function of the cross ratios, then we could generate new greens
functions from existing ones by multiplying them by arbitrary functions of
h.

we shall explore this idea later on in this paper. for the moment, we

return to the three point function to nd its explicit form for any given q.

14

5 the full n = 1 three-point solution

the special case where :

(59)

we also know from our discussion above that we can generate a new solution
to dierent ward identities, which have q = q1 + q, by multiplying g0
3 by
any degree zero function of spq which obeys

we have also seen that the only solutions to such an equation must be in the
form of a sum of products of s2

pq, so that in general

for some constants cab. acting on this with k   and setting the coecients of
the linearly independent terms to zero, we see that for each term individually,
we obtain

 a + 3q3 = 0,
a + b + 3q2 = 0,
b + 3q1 = 0.

(62)

we can solve this for a and b, given q, and thus we obtain the general form
of the scalar three-point function, as

up to a multiplicative constant. from the above arguments concerning the
allowed form of r, it also follows that the only way to generalise this to include
non-scalar three-point functions is to multiply g3 by a constant tensor, such
as , otherwise k   will not vanish.

6 the complete three-point solution in ex-

tended supersymmetry

15

6.1 n = 2

we can generalise the discussion of three-point solutions to situations where
n > 1. for example, when n = 2 we have twice as many spinors, i.e. (1)
123
and (2)
123.

one might suppose that we could construct a new type of solution with

q0 = 1, but such a solution would have to take the form

= (1) 

123 f  

(2) 
123 ,

(64)

g(2)

3 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)q0=1

for some function, f   of spq. however, acting on this with q(1)
that both the coecient of (2)

23 in the resulting expression, vanish

(cid:19) = 0.

12 and of (2)

123 f  s1

12

implies that

(65)

in section 3 we showed that this can only be satised when f   = 0. one
can extend this argument to prove that there are no solutions for q0 < n
and hence a non-zero n-point solution only exists for

n  q0  (n  2)n.

(66)

the upper bound simply follows from the fact that the solution must be
composed from (n  2) (i)
pqrs, for a given internal symmetry index i, of
which there are n types.

as a result, the general n = 2 three-point function has to be of the form

g(2)

= f (spq) (1)2

123

123 ,

(67)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)q0=2

123 , at rst sight there

at this point it helps to consider the action of d, which depends on n,
and hence the n = 2 solution cannot simply be a product of two n = 1
solutions, as one might initially expect. closer inspection reveals that for d
13 f (spq) (2)2
to vanish we require f to be of degree zero in spq and as a result s2

123

16

has to be degree zero in spq aswell. expansion of this term in (2)
pq gives a
series of linearly independent terms whose coecients can all be expressed
as combinations of expressions of the form

(sp,p+1.sq,q+1)

s2
p,p+1

.

q(1)

we know from section 4 that such functions must vanish under the action of
(1)2
 at three-points, and thus it is precisely the same nilpotence which
123
prevented us from obtaining unique solutions, that is responsible for the
existence of any three-point solutions at all beyond n = 1. thus, from the
q  superconformal ward identity we nd no further condition.

as before, we can nd the unique form of f by demanding that k  g(2)

in n = 4 supersymmetry, the q dependence drops out of the ward identities
because of the factor (4  n)/n and r-symmetry no longer holds. instead,
we can dene q0 to be half the degree of (i)
pq and the condition given in
eq. (66) still holds. in the usual way, we write

and f , g, h, k, l, m are all arbitrary functions of the six independent 4-point
scalars, s2
34, (s12.s23), (s23.s34), (s12.s34), from which all other 4-point
scalars can be constructed using the relations given in appendix appendix b.
we must now impose the rest of the ward identities on g4, beginning
with d. this implies that all the arbitrary functions f , g, h, k, l, m are in
fact of degree zero, or in other words are functions of ve independent ratios
of the scalars given above.

to impose k   is an enormous calculation to perform by hand, and thus
we use a computer algebra package, written in mathematica, especially for
the purposes of this calculation. first of all we operate with k   on g4,
which is relatively straight forward. we shall not go into the details of
how that was done in this paper, but we do discuss some of the details of
the simplication of the resulting expression in appendix appendix a. in
particular, this appendix describes how one can dene a set of canonical
forms in terms of which all other expressions can be written. in this way,
the computer can collect like terms and we can then separate out our results
into a sum of linearly independent terms. the coecients of these terms can
then be set to zero individually, allowing us to restrict the form of the six
arbitrary functions using the resulting equations.

after expanding the expression for k  g4 in terms of the basis described
in appendix appendix a, we can use some of the resulting equations to show
that,

m = 0
h = k + l.

after some algebra, it follows that we can rewrite the ansatz for g4 in a

restrict the form of these functions so that their arbitrariness comes only from
their dependence on the four-point cross ratios u and v, dened in eq. (57).

(93)

it is immediately apparent that by specifying four constants, which are
the values of f , g, k and l at some point u0, v0, we can determine all rst
derivatives using equations (89) - (92). by dierentiation we can determine
all second derivatives in terms of known lower derivatives at u0, v0 and thus
we can determine all higher derivatives at this point by repeating this process
indenitely. consequently we can construct the solution around u0, v0 as an
innite taylor expansion in u, v, and thus the solution is uniquely specied
by these four constants.

of course one could instead try to solve the above equations by imposing

integrability relations, such as

2

uv

f =

2

vu

f.

(94)

2
by calculating
vu f in two dierent ways from (89) and equating these
expressions, we ought to nd a relationship between f , g, k, l and their rst
derivatives. substituting for the rst derivatives using equations (89) - (92),
we should get a relationship between f , k, g and l alone. however, we nd in
all cases that this is simply the trivial statement that 0 = 0. this implies that
the equations are integrable in the given form and thus in order to solve them
one must specify the values of f , g, k and l at some initial point, as above.
in other words, the integrability relations do not yield further relationships
which could be used to reduce the number of constants which have to be
specied to obtain a solution.

an alternative approach is to consider equations (92), and rewrite them

21

to make k and g the subjects, as in

g q1 =

k q3 =

u v (1 + u + v) vl2 + 2 u2 v ul2 + 3 u v l2 q2 + 3 f2 q4

2 u2 v vl2 + u2 (1 + u + v) ul2 + 3 u2 l2 q2 + 3 f2 q4

3 u

(95)

3

we then substitute these expressions into eqs. (89) to eliminate k and g
completely, giving

uf =

vf =

u2 v vl + (3  3 q1  3 q2) f

u2 v ul + (1 + 3 q1 + 3 q4) f

u

v

.

(96)

note that at no time do we divide by any function of qi as without knowing
q, we cannot be sure that such a function is non-zero. dierentiating the
rst of eqs. (96) with respect to v and the second with respect to u, we use
the integrability condition

2

uv

f =

2

vu

f

(97)

to combine the two equations. we then use eqs. (96) to remove the deriva-
tives of f from the resulting expression, giving an equation in l alone,

v v2l  u u2l + (1  3q1  3q2) ul + (2  3q1  3q4) vl = 0,

(98)

where

unvml 

n+m
unvm .

(99)

to do this, we only used equations (92) and (89), and thus we could
repeat the process using equations (92) and (90) or equations (92) and (91)
to obtain other equations in l(u, v) alone. of the three second order linear
partial dierential equations which result, only two are linearly independent.
the other can be written as

(1 + v) v v2l + 2 uv uvl + u2 u2l + 3 u (q1 + 2q2 + q3) ul+

3 q2 (2  3q4) l + (1  3 q2  3 q3 + 3 v (1 + q2  q4)) vl = 0

(100)

to investigate these simultaneous equations we proceed as follows.2 once
again, we continue to try to impose higher order integrability relations, such
as

3l

u2v

=

3l

vu2

etc,

(101)

2we wish to thank thomas wolf and allan wittkopf for their help with the following

argument.

22

by dierentiating the above pdes for l. we make u2l the subject of eq. (98)
and uvl the subject of eq. (100). dierentiating eq. (98) with respect to
v and eq. (100) with respect to u and eliminating u2vl, we obtain three
dierential equations for

uvl, u2l, v3l

(in terms of only l, ul, vl, v2l), from which all other higher derivatives can
be obtained. that is to say, we have a system of pdes whose integrability
conditions are simply identities which follow as a consequence of these three
equations alone and thus impose no further restrictions on l(u, v). this cor-
responds to the statement above where the complete solution is determined
by four independent arbitrary constants.

in this approach one can construct complete solutions given a function
l which satises the given dierential equations. these solutions are not
in the form of taylor expansions and, as an illustration, we have explicitly
constructed two distinct solutions for a given q. for example, if we take

q = (1/3, 0, q3, 4/3  q3)

(102)

we nd that

u4v(23q3)

k = 43q3
3q3
g = (3q3  4)u4v(23q3)
f = u4v(23q3)
l = constant,

is a solution, and so is

k = (2 + 2u  3q3u  2v)(2  3q3)v(23q3)
f =  1
g = 1
l = v(23q3).

2 (2  3q3)u2v(23q3)

2 (2  3q3)u2v(23q3)

(103)

(104)

clearly these two solutions have the same q, but they dier in the values of
the four constants which determine the particular form of the solution. one
can construct similar examples for dierent choices of q.

8 conclusions

in this paper we have found the most general three-point greens function
for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 supersymmetry which is composed of chiral superelds of
a given chirality. we have also shown that although there exist no chiral

23

superconformal invariants, [12] the greens functions of chiral superelds
are not uniquely specied above three-points when the the r-charge, q0, is
greater than n. this result relies crucially on the nilpotent character of such
greens functions. however, for the particular case q0 = 1, n = 1 we have
shown that the solutions are unique up to the specication of four constants
of integration. we have given two equivalent formulations of the solution
which should enable one to explicitly construct the solution in any particular
case.

the results of our investigations seem to suggest that our ndings should
generalise to extended supersymmetry, where we expect to nd a unique
solution at four-points in the case where q0 = n. furthermore, it is tempting
to suggest that all higher-point functions may also be uniquely determined
in the case where q0 = n. at the moment, however, these two statements
remain conjectures based upon our explicit results for the n = 1 four-point
solution at q0 = n and for the three-point solutions for n  1.

after this work had been completed a preprint [19] appeared on the hep-
th archive which also discusses greens functions in superconformal eld
theories.

appendix a a linearly independent basis

in this paper, we need to dene a set of linearly independent terms in terms
which any relevant expression up to four points can be expanded. this basis
of terms can be used to dene an explicit expression for a greens function
which is written as a sum of such terms with arbitrary scalar functions as
coecients. each ward identity then gives us a single constraint on each

24

greens function, but by expansion in an appropriate basis of terms one can
deduce several dierential equations which must be independently satised
by the unknown functions in the expansion of the greens function. therefore
it is critical that we are able to dene a suitable collection of bases to justify
all of the calculations performed in the paper. in this appendix we discuss
the main details of how this was done.

the denition of linear independence is that if a linear combination of a
set of linearly independent terms vanishes, then all coecients must vanish
independently. hence, to prove that a set of terms are linearly independent
we need to consider general expressions at up to four points which are known
to vanish. the ward identities also provide us with a set of expressions which
are known to vanish, and thus problem of the determination of a basis for
expansion of a generalised greens function and the problem of separation of a
ward identity into several independent identities for the unknown coecients
in the greens function can be solved in the same way. this is done as follows.
p which vanishes, such
as a ward identity. we need to simplify this expression so that it is written
in terms of a linearly independent set of terms with some known coecients.
to begin with we observe that one can always consider terms containing
dierent  variables to be linearly independent. for example, the equation

imagine that we have an expression in 

p and s 

a2

1 + b2

2 + c12 = 0,

(105)

where a, b, c are independent of i, implies that a = b = c = 0. this is easily
shown by multiplying by 2
1, to show that b = 0, and then continuing in the
obvious way with 12 and 2
1.

it follows that we can immediately separate out a given vanishing expres-
sion into coecients of distinct combinations of 
p and equate these coe-
cients to zero. (in all our expressions we ensure, for simplicity, that there are
grksp1 or
no free indices by contracting them with the arbitrary vector kgrksp1
sometimes an inert  variable.) we write each term in the form

2
q1 . . . 2

pnh... = 0

qm

p1

p2 . . . 

(106)

and dene  <  < . . . < , given that p1 < p2 < . . . < pn. the coecients,
h..., are in general functions of s 
p and may be written in many dierent
but equivalent forms.

to give a simple example, consider the relation,

   +  = 0.

(107)

clearly, we must not allow one of these terms on the left to be present in
the expansion of ha1a2...an, as it is linearly dependent on the other two. we

25

therefore impose the rule that, in the canonical (i.e. simplied) form of an
expression,

    ,

(108)

if  <  and  >  > .

note that we are also assuming that the antisymmetry of  has al-
ready been used to order the indices uniquely in each  tensor on the left, so
that  <  and  < . similarly, we can use the relations in appendix ap-
pendix b to show that any product of s 
p can be reduced to a sum of bilinear
products of the form (sp.sq) and scalars. such terms can be written such
that p < q and  < , up to terms involving only scalars and  (see ap-
pendix appendix b). these latter terms are lower order in (sp.sq) and
can subsequently be further ordered without producing any further higher
order terms. (in this respect, since the number of free indices in each term
is always the same, we dene lower order terms as those containing more 
terms and fewer (sp.sq) and vice versa for higher order terms.) given this,
we impose the rule,

(sp.sq)  (sp.sq) + (sp.sq),

(109)

whenever  <  <  (assuming  <  and  < ), to dene a canonical form
for products of (sp.sq) and . then, we use the relations

(sp.sq)(sr.st)  (sp.sq)(sr.st)  (sp.sq.sr.st),

(110)

where p < q, r < t, c < b and (sp.sq) 6= (sr.st), and

(sp.sq)(sp.sq)  (sp.sq)(sp.sq)  (sp.sq.sp.sq),

(111)

where  <  < , to show that any product of (sp.sq) tensors can have
its indices totally ordered. once again, the extra terms on the right hand
side are of lower order in (sp.sq) and can therefore be further ordered but
without generating terms of higher order than themselves (see eq. (137)).

next we must deal with the internal dotted indices in the (sp.sq) terms.

one can use the relation

     =           ,

(112)

to dene the rule

(sp.sq)(sr.st)  (sp.sr)(sq.st)  (sp.st)(sq.sr),

(113)

whenever t < q and r < p, assuming p < q and r < t. this is compatible
with eq. (109).

26

the above rules apply to all terms, even those with more than four free
indices, but they do not necessarily dene a basis as we have not shown that
the set of allowed terms which remain are linearly independent. clearly the
remaining terms span the space, as we can write down all possible terms
which could arise and then use the above rules to reduce them to a much
smaller set of terms, which therefore manifestly span the space. it remains
to nd a linearly independent subset of the resulting set of terms. however,
it is not always immediately obvious whether a given set of terms is linearly
independent or not. some of the linear dependencies which exist amongst
the canonical terms above are rather complicated. for example, there are
two ways to simplify the following trace

(s1.s2.s3.s4.s4.s3.s2.s1).

(114)

an obvious method of simplication is to use eq. (133) repeatedly to show
that

(s1.s2.s3.s4.s4.s3.s2.s1) = 

1
8

s2
1s2

2s2

3s2
4.

(115)

alternatively, one might rst use eq. (137) on the rst four terms and then
separately on the last four terms before multiplying out the result. it is clear
by inspection that this has to give an expression in [s1.s2.s3.s4]2, which is
not manifestly the same as the right-hand side of eq. (115), but is equal to
it by construction. consequently, there is a non-trivial relationship between
a set of scalar quantities, and we can use this in our calculations to eliminate
[s1.s2.s3.s4]2, for example.

in a similar way, one can construct relationships between the canonical

terms dened above which allow us to eliminate all terms of the form

[s1.s2.s3.s4](s1.s2)

(116)

from our basis. (we note that this can be done in all the cases we consider in
this paper as we can ensure that we have only four independent four vectors,
namely k, s12, s23 and s34. in calculations involving k we must also include
s0, but one can easily show that k g is independent of s0 as long as dg = 0,
which we can always choose to be true where necessary.)

even given the above results, nding all of the linear dependencies which
can arise between the terms which remain is a dicult task and since the
proof of linear independence is vital to our approach we set out to prove the
validity of any suggested basis as follows. beginning with a set of terms,
vi
abc..., with some xed number of free indices, abc . . ., which span the space
and which have all known linear dependencies removed, in the way described

27

above, we can write down the most general expression tabc... with this number
of free indices as an expansion in vi
abc... with arbitrary scalar coecients, ai
as follows

tabc... = xi

vi
abc...ai.

(117)

note that the ai are scalar functions of s12, s23 and s34 only and any depen-
dence of t on k, which always occurs at most linearly in t for our calcula-
tions, must be carried explicitly by the basis terms, vi. therefore we need a
k-dependent basis for ward identitity expansions and a k-independent basis
for greens function expansions. a k-independent basis can be easily de-
duced from the corresponding k-dependent basis, i.e. the one with the same
number of free indices on t .

we are concerned with the conditions satised by the functions ai, given
that t = 0. by contracting each of the vi with t we can build up a set
of equations viabc...tabc... = 0. furthermore, by eliminating (k.s12.s23.s34)2
as described above, following eq. (115), we can equate the coecients of
(ks12), (ks23), (ks34) and (k.s12.s23.s34) to zero independently and hence
generate several equations in each case. this step can be rigorously justied
by choosing several independent values for the arbitray vector k and solving
the resulting equations in each case, but note that it is clearly invalid unless
we eliminate (k.s12.s23.s34)2 rst.

the resulting set of equations can be written as

mijaj = 0,

(118)

for some matrix m dependent only on s12, s23 and s34. we can then attempt
to put m into upper triangular form using row and column operations and in
the process simply removing any rows which are all zero as these correspond
to trivial conditions on the ai. however, we must take great care that we
do not divide by zero inadvertently during this process as it may be that
we divide by a scalar expression which is not manifestly zero, but which
vanishes upon expansion into the components of the four-vectors of which
it is constructed. (the discussion following eq. (115) illustrates such a null
scalar expression composed of four four-vectors. it is unlikely that such an
expression can be constructed from only three four-vectors, but we were in
any case careful to explicitly avoid this error. such considerations will clearly
be relevant for studies of ve-point functions and above.)

if the matrix, m, can be reduced to upper triangular form, its determinant
can be easily calculated as the product of the diagonal elements and by
expansion in components can be shown not to vanish. in this case, the vi
form a basis as we have demonstrated that when t = 0, ai = 0.

abc...

28

if the matrix, m, cannot be reduced to upper triangular form we can use
eq. (118) to eliminate a maximal subset of the ai from t . since t vanishes
and the remaining ai are arbitrary, it follows that the coecient of each of
the remaining ai is a linear dependency amongst the original vi and can be
used to eliminate some of the vi to dene an improved set of terms vi which
are, by construction, manifestly linearly independent and span the space, i.e.
a basis.

in summary, this process allows us to both dene a basis in terms of which
to write a general greens function before imposing the ward identities or
alternatively to dene a basis in terms of which we can expand a particular
ward identity, and also it generates any extra simplication rules necessary
to reduce a particular expression to the required canonical form, so that we
are justied in equating the coecients of the resulting terms to zero. it is
these sort of calculations which validate the various arguments given in the
rest of the paper.
