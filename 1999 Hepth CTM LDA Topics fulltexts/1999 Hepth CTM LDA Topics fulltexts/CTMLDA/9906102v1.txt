an initial step is taken in investigating the duality between the near horizon region of a four
dimensional extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole and the n-particle, n = 4 calogero model as
conjectured by gibbons and townsend. specically we compute the mass spectrum of d = 4, n = 8
supergravity about the bertotti-robinson solution and nd the corresponding set of conformal
dimensions of states in the dual conformal quantum mechanics. we nd that the dual states ll
irreducible representations of the supergroup su (1, 1|2), and furthermore transform under various
irreducible representations of the group su (2)  su (6) spontaneously broken down from the e7(7)
duality group of n = 8 supergravity.

i. introduction

the ads2/cf t1 duality conjectured by maldacena [1] has received relativity little attention as compared to some
of its higher dimensional cousins.
it is however one of the most interesting cases with regard to black holes as
the geometry ads2  s2 arises as the near horizon geometry of a reissner-nordstrom black hole. while the higher
dimensional ads/cf t dualities have been primarily used to learn about gauge theory through gravity, one hopes that
the reverse can be done for four-dimensional black holes. that is to say, it seems natural that a conformal quantum
mechanics will be simpler than a supergravity theory on ads2. some recent investigations into the ads2/cf t duality
are given in [2,3].

since the ads/cf t duality was discovered by studying d-brane congurations, in the hope of applying the duality
to 4 dimensional black holes it is reasonable to begin by looking for such solutions which have a d-brane interpretation.
one such solution [4] consists of four sets of d-branes in which any pair intersects over a string. wrapping the d-branes
on a six-torus and taking each set of the four intersecting d-branes to have equal charge gives rise to the extreme
reissner-nordstrom solution. the near horizon geometry of this solution is well known to be ads2s2, with isometry
supergroup su (1, 1|2). the results of [5] further indicate that in fact ads2 s2 is a solution to the full type iib string
theory and therefore that su (1, 1|2) must also be a symmetry of the dual conformal quantum mechanics. gibbons
and townsend [3] have conjectured that the dual cf t is given by the n-particle, n = 4 superconformal calogero
model, which has yet to be constructed for arbitrary n (see [6] for the n = 1 case.)
as a rst step toward investigating this conjecture we consider the ads2 side of the duality. the low energy limit of
type ii(a or b) string theory on t 6 is the n = 8 supergravity theory of cremmer and julia [7]. o-shell this theory
has an so(8) symmetry while on-shell the symmetry is enhanced to an e7(7) duality. we expand this theory about
the above d3-brane solution in the near horizon limit to linearized order in the uctuations to nd the mass spectrum.
using the prescription of gubser, klebanov, and polyakov [8] and witten [9] we then extract the conformal weights of
the dual cf t states and show that they lie in irreducible representations of su (1, 1|2), consistent with the fact that
six of the supersymmetries are broken in the near horizon limit of the d3-brane solution [10]. furthermore the e7(7)
duality symmetry is broken to su (2)  su (6) [11] and indeed the dual cf t elds lie in irreducible representations
of this group as well.
the procedure for extracting the masses is well known. for example, type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 was
considered in [12,13] and 11 dimensional supergravity on ads4  s7 and ads7  s4 (among other spacetimes) in [14].
more recently the mass spectrum of 6 dimensional, n = 4b supergravity on ads3  s3 [15] was found for which the
dual cf t is 2 dimensional and detailed checks on the correctness of the conjectured duality could be made, see [16]
and references therein. other cases considered recently include 5 dimensional simple supergravity on ads3  s2 [17]
and ads2  s3 [18], and n = 8 supergravity on ads3  s2 [11]. in this paper we follow closely the procedure of [12]
to compute the mass spectrum of 4 dimensional n = 8 supergravity about ads2  s2.
in section ii we briey describe the d = 4, n = 8 supergravity theory of cremmer and julia [7] and give the
bertotti-robinson (br) solution [19] consisting of an ads2  s2 geometry with a nonvanishing two-form ux on the

two-sphere. in section iii we diagonalize the bosonic equations of motion to obtain their mass spectrum, and repeat
the procedure in section iv for the fermionic elds. in section v we go on to compute the conformal dimensions
of the corresponding states of the conformal quantum mechanics model and demonstrate that they lie in irreducible
representations of su (1, 1|2). in section vi we end with some conclusions.

we work in the signature (, +, +, +).

the convention that e0123 = e. in the next subsection we x the su (8) symmetry and nd expressions for hmn

the supersymmetry transformations of the bosonic elds can be found in [7].

b. bertotti-robinson background

the generic 56 charge black hole solution to n = 8 supergravity can be obtained by applying an e7(7) duality
transformation to a 5-parameter generating solution [20]. in particular an arbitrary 56 charge black hole with xed
moduli is obtained by applying an arbitrary element of su (8)( e7(7)) to the 5-parameter solution with the same
moduli. the 56 charge black hole with arbitrary moduli is then obtained by applying an e7(7) transformation. the
56 dressed charges t into an e7(7) invariant antisymmetric matrix zab (a, b = 1, , 8) transforming in the 28
of su (8). this matrix can be block diagonalized via an su (8) transformation as

zab =

.

(2.10)

the unbroken global symmetry group of the solution is then given by the subgroup of su (8) that leaves zab invariant.
a particular case of interest are the extreme black holes, which can be put in the form (2.10) with 2 = 3 = 4 = 0,

and therefore have su (2) su (6) global symmetry group [11]. it follows that any extreme black hole can be obtained
from any other extreme black hole by an su (8) transformation (and then an e7(7) transformation to change the moduli
if necessary). since the mass spectrum is invariant under these transformations then knowing it for one means that
we know it for all, and in particular for the intersecting d3-brane solution of [4]. we are actually only interested in
the near horizon limit, but clearly the same argument applies. rather than expanding about the near horizon limit
of the intersecting d3-brane solution, which is ads2  s2 with four non-vanishing vector elds, we instead expand
about the same geometry but with only one non-zero vector with ux on s2 only. we now proceed to describe this
background.

we consider the compactication of the n = 8 supergravity theory (2.1) about the br solution consisting of an

ads2  s2 geometry with curvature tensors

(2.12)

where , , ... are curved ads2 indices, , , ... curved s2 indices, and l is the radius of curvature of both spaces. the
only other non-vanishing eld that we consider is a two-form ux on s2 which we take to be2

[12]

, e.

(2.13)

i.e., the freund-rubin ansatz [21]. the ads2 and s2 volume elements are denoted e and e respectively and are
related to the four-dimensional volume element by e = ee. the remaining elds in (2.1) vanish except for
the vielbein v which is equal to the identity

v =   [m

[a  n ]

(2.14)

that these elds actually solve the equations of motion is clear from the expression (2.20) for hmn given in the

next section. when all elds vanish except for g and b[12]



and v is given by (2.14) then

 ,

(2.15)

in which case the action (2.1) reduces to the einstein-maxwell action.

the br solution preserves only two of the eight supersymmetries [10]. to see this set the fermionic supersymmetry
transformations (2.9a,2.9b) to zero. it immediately follows from sabc = 0 that c = 0 for c 6= 1, 2. the remaining
conditions are satised trivially except for sa = 0 for a = 1, 2 which implies the killing spinor equations

where we have decomposed a into a product of two-component spinors as a = a  a and similarly for the
-matrices as discussed in the appendix.

c. linearized equations of motion

to nd the equations of motion we must solve (2.8) for hmn . to do this it is convenient to x the su (8) gauge

symmetry to the so called symmetric gauge where v = exp(x) and

2we put square brackets around the m, n indices when they take specic numerical values in order to avoid confusion with
other indices.

(2.18)

(2.19)

in this gauge it is straightforward to determine hmn from (2.8). since our interest is in computing the mass

it is sucient to consider

the solution to (2.8) is not unique. we have used this freedom to simplify the equations of motion as much as possible.

however is given by

a and pabcd follow straightforwardly in this gauge from (2.3) and (2.18). q b

to nd the bosonic mass spectrum on ads2 we expand the elds in spherical harmonics on s2. the expansions
are quite simple in this case as all harmonic functions on the 2-sphere can be expressed in terms of just the scalar
spherical harmonics ylm. the expansions of the bosonic uctuations are then given by (denoting the l, m indices
collectively by (k))

before substituting the expansions into the linearized equations of motion we can rst simplify the expansions by

for the m = 1, n = 2 vector equations. all equations are valid for k  2. the k = 0, 1 cases will be handled
separately. actually one notices that there are more equations than elds. an important consistency check is that the
equations are not all independent, as follows easily by taking divergences on the ads2 index of the above equations.
more generally this follows from the bianchi identities.

the einstein equations (3.11a), (3.11c) and (3.11e) allow one to eliminate the metric uctuation h (k)

 (locally)
in terms of the remaining elds. this follows by a simple counting argument5. a homogeneous solution to these
equations would have to satisfy h (k) = 0 and h (k)
 though,
i.e., three equations and three unknowns. however h (k)
 must also satisfy the homogeneous part of (3.11a), which
clearly cannot be the case in general for arbitrary k. in fact one can show easily that the traceless and divergenceless
conditions imply (2
eectively to scalars (eb(k)
with the operator e and using the two-dimensional identity

 k = 1 sector

the k = 1 sector equations of motion follow from the k  2 equations after taking into account the gauge xing
3 = 0 and the relations (3.7). the latter equations imply that the einstein equations (3.11d) and (3.11e)

condition (1)
are not separate equations but rather are replaced by

(cid:1) = 8b(1)
furthermore (3.11f) no longer follows from the einstein equations but nevertheless holds due to our choice of gauge
(3.10). as a consequence the coupled equations (3.14b) for (eb(1)
) continue to hold for
k = 1, and therefore also the masses (3.16). however at k = 1 the mass m2 = k(k  1) vanishes and therefore one of
the vectors must be massless, in particular one can show that

finally the gauge eld b(0)[12]
can be eliminated by the u (1) gauge symmetry exactly as described above. a
summary of the masses of the n = 2 supergravity scalars is given in table 1. a nal comment before leaving this
section is to note that for k  2 half of the local degrees of freedom of b(k)
2 and all local degrees of freedom of
h (k)
 (in the k  1 case as well) were eliminated by equations of motion. normally these are eliminated by gauge
symmetries as in the k = 0 case above. in fact though their elimination for k  2 also follows by gauge symmetry.
four-dimensional dieomorphism invariance must remove eight four-dimensional elds. four of these elds were
removed immediately when we xed the gauge (3.5). the remaining four followed via the equations of motion.

c. completion of bosonic elds to n = 8 supergravity

the remaining bosonic elds of n = 8 supergravity are the scalars wabcd and vectors bmn

for m, n 6= 1, 2. before
computing their mass spectrum lets rst understand the su (2)  su (6) transformation properties of the elds. for
the scalars this follows trivially from their su (8) transformation properties. for the vectors it is actually the eld
strength tensors (2.5) that transform under su (8). substituting the vector and scalar expansions (3.1d,3.1e,3.1f) and
the expression for the bosonic part of hmn in the symmetric gauge (2.20) we nd

su (6) transformation properties follow. note that the scalar contribution to (3.27) vanishes when either m or n is
1 or 2.

of scalars transform in the (1, 15) of su (2)  su (6).

iv. fermionic masses

a. spinor harmonic expansion on s2

a complete set of complex two-component spinors on s2 is given by slm and 5slm [23] (-matrix conventions

are given in the appendix) where s = , m = 0, ..., (l + 1), and

(d  i(l + 1))slm = 0
(d + i(l + 1))5slm = 0.

the spinors also satisfy the complex conjugation property

(slm) = i(s)5s,lm.

the 4-dimensional spinor and gravitino expansions therefore take the form

removed for k  1, a = 1, 2 and k  0, a 6= 1, 2. the case k = 0, a = 1, 2 is slightly more subtle because of the
existence of the killing spinors (s,0) which satisfy

into two (2, 1) representations of su (2)  su (6).

therefore we have a single complex spinor with mass m = 1 transforming under the (2, 1) representation of su (2) 
su (6). we also have the two-dimensional gravitino (s,0)

residual supersymmetry transformations satisfying (s,0)

the equation of motion (4.15b) then reduces to ed(s,0)

+a = 0, which is also the equation satised by residual

c. completion of the fermionic elds to n = 8

the remaining fermionic elds are the spinors abc and the a 6= 1, 2 gravitini a. the a = 1, 2; b, c 6= 1, 2
spinors are already completely decoupled so their masses follow almost immediately. substituting the expansion (4.3a)
into the equation of motion (2.28b) we nd after taking appropriate linear combinations

where

(cid:0)d  (k + 1)(cid:1)(s,k)

abc = 0

(4.19)

(4.20)
therefore we have one tower of complex spinors with mass m = (k + 1), degeneracy 2(k + 1) at level k  0, and
transforming in the (2, 15) of su (2)  su (6).
the a, b, c 6= 1, 2 spinor masses are also straightforward to compute. substituting the expansion (4.3a) as well as
the background eld strength (2.13) into the equation of motion (2.28c) yields after some rearranging6

for these elds we therefore nd two towers of complex spinors, one with mass m = k for k  1 and the other with
mass m = (k + 2) for k  0. both have degeneracy 2(k + 1) at level k and transform in the (1, 6) of su (2)  su (6).

however do not transform covariantly under su (8) because of the 5 matrix appearing in the transformation law of abc .
their transformation law is easy to nd and indeed one may show that an su (6) transformation maps these equations into
themselves and their complex conjugates (after letting s  s).

v. su (1, 1|2) multiplets

irreducible representations of su (1, 1|2) are labelled by the eigenvalues of the l0 and j0 generators of the sl(2, r)
su (2) subalgebra. the irreducible representations have been constructed in [24] and in particular the so-called short
multiplets which will be of interest here. the short multiplet irreducible representations consist of the states

d(k)(k)  2d(k1/2)(k + 1/2)  d(k1)(k + 1)

(5.1)
for half-integer k  1/2 (where in the k = 1/2 case it is understood that the d(1/2)(3/2) states are missing). we
now proceed to show that the states listed in tables 1 and 2 ll various short multiplet representations of su (1, 1|2).
an irreducible representation of su (2) labelled by j0 eigenvalue j has (2j + 1) states. for the harmonic expansions
of the scalar elds (with degeneracy (2k + 1)) this implies j = k. for the spinors with degeneracy 2(k + 1) we have
j = (k + 1/2). the l0 eigenvalue of the states comes from the ads/cf t map developed in [8,9]. the conformal
weight of a boundary conformal eld corresponding to an ads2 scalar was shown to be

and for a spinor [25]

hscalar =

1
2

(1 +p1 + 4m2),

hspinor = m +

1
2

.

(5.2)

(5.3)

plugging in the various scalar and spinor masses that we have found results in the conformal weights shown in tables
1 and 2 respectively.

the n = 8 supergravity elds also carry su (2)  su (6) indices, and therefore so will the boundary states. we

therefore label the complete boundary states as

where as above h and j label the sl(2, r)  su (2) content of su (1, 1|2) and r2  r6 labels the su (2)  su (6)
content. from tables 1 and 2 we can now read o the representations. for the n = 2 sector we nd two sets of

d(j)(h)(r2  r6)

(5.4)

d(k)(k)(1, 1)  d(k1/2)(k + 1/2)(2, 1)  d(k1)(k + 1)(1, 1)

for k  1 and k  2. for the remaining elds we nd the representations

d(k+1/2)(k + 1/2)(1, 20)  d(k)(k + 1)(2, 20)  d(k1/2)(k + 3/2)(1, 20)
d(k+1/2)(k + 1/2)(1, 6)  d(k)(k + 1)(2, 6)  d(k1/2)(k + 3/2)(1, 6)

vi. conclusions

we have computed the mass spectrum of the n = 8 supergravity theory about ads2  s2. we have shown that
the corresponding spectrum of states in the boundary conformal eld theory lies in short multiplets of the ads2
supergroup su (1, 1|2). the states further carry su (2)  su (6) indices inherited from the spontaneously broken
su (8) gauge group of the supergravity theory.
eventually one hopes to identify these boundary states in the d = 1, n = 4 n-particle calogero model, conjectured
[3] to be the dual conformal quantum mechanics model to the the near horizon region of the intersecting d3-brane
solution [4]. as noted in [3] though, this theory has yet to be constructed. recently however the one-dimensional
single particle calogero model has been constructed [6] for an arbitrary number of supersymmetries. generalization
of the model to arbitrary n should be straightforward. once this is done a detailed check on the correspondence
between the two theories should be possible.

we have ignored the boundary degrees of freedom except for one massless vector in the n = 2 sector which was
needed to ll an su (1, 1|2) representation. such elds may also be necessary in realizing the ads/cf t duality. it
should be straightforward to extract this information from the results in this paper.
while this work was being written up another paper [22] appeared reporting similar results for the n = 2 sector
of the n = 8 supergravity theory discussed here. [22] also considered in detail the boundary degrees of freedom for
n = 2 supergravity.

where the metric signature is (, +, +, +) and a and  both take values in 0, 1, 2, 3. by choosing the gamma matrices
to be real, the majorana condition reduces to  = . we split the a-matrices under so(1, 3)  so(1, 1)  so(2)
as

where now a = 0, 1 and i = 2, 3. we dene the so(1, 1) and so(2) 5 matrices by 4 := 01 and 5 := i23
respectively. one possible choice of -matrices satisfying the above -matrix conventions is given by

a = a  5,

i = 1  i
