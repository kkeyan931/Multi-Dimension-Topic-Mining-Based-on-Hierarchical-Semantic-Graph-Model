the casimir energy is the rst-order-in- correction to the energy of a
time-independent eld conguration in a quantum eld theory. we study
the casimir energy in a toy model, where the classical eld is replaced by
a separable potential. in this model the exact answer is trivial to compute,
making it a good place to examine subtleties of the problem. we construct
two traditional representations of the casimir energy, one from the greens
function, the other from the phase shifts, and apply them to this case. we
show that the two representations are correct and equivalent in this model.
we study the convergence of the born approximation to the casimir energy
and relate our ndings to computational issues that arise in more realistic
models.

i. introduction

casimir energies are important in quantum eld theories, where they give the rst-
order (in ) corrections to the energy of time-independent classical eld congurations.
computations of the casimir energy involve formal manipulations of divergent expressions

that eventually are regulated and renormalized. [2] since they go beyond perturbation theory,
casimir energy calculations provide a potentially powerful way to study nonperturbative

eects. several formally equivalent representations of the casimir energy have been used
in numerical calculations, notably (a) in terms of integrals over scattering phase shifts and

bound states; (b) as an integral over the trace of a greens function (equivalent to a functional
determinant); and (c) as an innite sum of feynman diagrams. the aim of this paper is
to study the various representations of the casimir energy in a simple, highly convergent

toy model, where the equivalence of dierent representations can be demonstrated without

the complication of divergences. our analysis does not demonstrate the equivalence of
representations in realistic models, where divergences make the arguments more complex.

however, we do see how the dierent representations are related in a simple, calculable
example. also, because the model is so simple, it is possible to explore some issues of

convergence and cancellation that are obscure in more realistic cases.

the model we study makes use of the simple dynamics of separable potentials in nonrel-

ativistic quantum mechanics. [1] our rst task is to explain how such a simple model can
give insight into one-loop eects in a quantum eld theory. next we review the well-known
greens function and scattering theory analysis of a separable potential. with this in hand

we discuss the various representations of the casimir energy and explore their relationship.
finally, we study convergence of the perturbative expansion and associated computational

issues.

formally, the casimir energy is the sum of zero point energies for the modes of a quantum

eld, , in the presence of some spatially varying background, 0(x),

ec = 1

2 x([0]  0)

(1)

where {[0]} are the eigenfrequencies in the presence of the nontrivial background eld
0, and {0} are the eigenfrequencies in the trivial background, 0 = 0. the {[0]} are
typically related to the eigenvalues of some simple dierential operator, h[0], which looks
like a schrodinger operator for a scalar eld,

h = 

d2
dx2 + v0(x)

(2)

or a dirac operator for a spinor eld. v0(x) is a potential derived from the eld 0.
although we have written eq. (2) for a scalar in one-dimension, the same considerations
apply in three-dimensions. typically the {} are not themselves the eigenvalues, {}, of
h but rather simple functions of the them. for example, in the case that  is a scalar,
j = pj + m2.
our toy model is based on two alterations in this physical picture: rst we assume that
the {} are proportional to the eigenvalues of h, as they would be in the nonrelativistic
case where (k) = 2k2/2m (and k2 is the eigenvalue of h); and second, we replace the
local potential, v (x), by a nonlocal, but separable potential,

v (x, x) = u(x)u(x)

(3)

where r dx u2(x) = 1. because of our rst assumption the casimir energy can be written as

ec = 1

2 tr(h  h0) .

(4)

r.l. jae and l.r. williamson

as a consequence of the separability assumption, h can be written formally as

h = h0  |uihu|

3

(5)

where |ui is the state with wavefunction u(x) = hx|ui. combining eqs. (4) and (5) we nd
that the casimir energy is  1

2,

ec =  1
=  1

2 tr{|ui hu|}
2  .

(6)

this is the fundamental result that makes the study of the casimir energy in separable
potential models interesting  the answer is so transparent. our object in this paper is to
show that more conventional (and more complicated) methods of computing the casimir

energy coincide with this simple result.

the remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

in the next section we review

the bound states, greens functions and scattering amplitude for a separable potential. in
section iii we derive expressions for the casimir energy in terms of integrals over greens

functions or scattering phase shifts. in section iv we compute the casimir energy using the
methods of section iii for the case of a separable potential and show that the result is  1
2.
in section v we specialize to a particular choice of u and explore the convergence of the

casimir energy calculation as a function of the strength, , of the interaction. we conclude
in section vi.

ii. separable potentials

in this section we review the solution of the scattering problem for a scalar particle
moving in an s-wave separable potential in three dimensions. we begin with the schrodinger

equation in three dimensions with a nonlocal potential,

2

2m 2(~r) +z d3r v (~r,~r)(~r) = (~r)



where

h~r|v |~ri = v (~r,~r) .

(7)

(8)

the resulting integral equation is in general more complicated than the local case, but for a
separable potential, eq. (3), it is simpler. for simplicity we take a separable and spherically

symmetric nonlocal potential,

v (~r,~r) = u(r)u(r)

(9)

r.l. jae and l.r. williamson

for which eq. (7) reduces to

2

2m 2(~r)  u(r)z d3r u(r)(~r) = (~r) .



4

(10)

for  > 0 the potential is attractive.

a principal simplication with a spherically symmetric, separable potential is the absence
of any interaction in partial waves with  > 0. this follows immediately from eq. (10) because

r d3r u(r)(~r) projects out only the spherically symmetric part of . all partial waves

except  = 0 cancel out of the casimir sum. we replace (~r) by u(r)/r and nd that
eq. (10) simplies to

 u (r)  4ru(r)z 

0

drru(r)u(r) = k2u(r)

(11)

where k2 = 2m/2, and where we have set  = 2m = 1 henceforth.

for scattering solutions, it is useful to convert eq. (11) into an integral equation for the

function, u (+)(r), obeying scattering boundary conditions,

u (+)(r) = u0(r) + 4z

into eq. (15),

the scattering amplitude, f (k), has a cut along the positive k2 axis induced by the cut
in x(). the cut begins with a branch point at threshold, k2 = 0. the discontinuity across
the cut is given by

disc f (k) = 2i im f (k) = 2i sin2 (k)

(18)

where we have used 1/(x + i) = pv(1/x)  i(x) to separate out the imaginary part
when x is real. the phase shift (k) can be read o eq. (16) conveniently by using the
parameterization, f (k) = 1/(cot   i),

in addition to the branch cut for real, positive k2, f (k) can be singular at values of k
where the denominator in eq. (16) vanishes, i.e., where x() = 1. bound states appear as
poles in f (k) for k2 < 0, or more precisely, k = i. [poles at k = i are virtual states.]
when k2 < 0, x(2) becomes real,

since x(2) is a decreasing function of , the criterion for existence of a bound state is
that x(0) > 1, or

(23)

this equation denes the critical value of  at which a bound state appears for a given

choice of u(r). note that there is at most one bound state in this separable potential. this
completes our review of the properties of a particle moving in a separable s-wave potential.

iii. the casimir energy

we are interested in (a) the greens function and (b) the phase shift expressions for the

casimir energy. both representations may be derived heuristically in the eective action
formalism in eld theory. [2] equally well, we can start from the formal expression, eq. (1),
and convert the sum over eigenenergies to a trace of a greens function or an integral over

phase shifts.

a. greens function representation

the greens function method starts from the greens function in coordinate/energy rep-

resentation,

g(~r,~r, ) = xj

j (~r)

j(~r)
j  

(24)

where the {j(~r)} are the unit-normalized1 energy eigenstates in coordinate space and the
summation ranges over the spectrum of h, so

(h  )g(~r,~r, ) = 3(~r ~r) .

(25)

in order to relate this to the casimir energy, consider the dierence of the greens functions
evaluated at   i and  + i integrated over space,

z 

0

d3r [g(~r,~r,  + i)  g(~r,~r,   i)] = 2ixj

[(  j)  (  0j)]

(26)

where g is the dierence between the greens function in the background potential and
the free greens function. to obtain the casimir energy, multiply eq. (26) by , integrate
from  to , and divide by 4i,
d z 

d3r [g(~r,~r,  + i)  g(~r,~r,   i)] .

ec =

(27)

1

4i z 



0

this result can be simplied further by introducing a function, f (), dened by its

derivative,

df ()

d

= z d3r g(~r,~r, )

(28)

1we proceed as if the spectrum is discrete and the states are normalizable. our result applies
equally to the case (of interest) where the spectrum is continuous and the states are normalized to
-functions.

and the condition that f ()  0 as ||  . then substituting into eq. (27) and integrat-
ing by parts, we nd

ec =

1

4i z 



d [f (  i)  f ( + i)] .

(29)

the surface terms at   i can be shown to cancel.

referring back to the denition of g, we see that the discontinuity in f along the re
 axis is associated with the eigenstates of h. let 0 be the ground state of h. for all
 < 0 we can send   0. then the integral of eq. (29) can be written as a contour integral
over a contour c (as shown in fig. 1) that runs in from + above the re  axis to 0 and
then returns to + below the re  axis,

ec =

1

4i ic

d f () =

1

4i ic

d f () .

(30)

in the second term we have replaced the contour c by the counterclockwise circle at inn-
ity, c, since in general the only singularities in f () lie on the real axis. this compact
expression will be particularly useful in the separable case.

b. phase shift representation

the phase shift representation for ec begins from eq. (1) divided up into bound state

and continuum contributions,

where bj are the binding energies, and ()  dn/d is the modication of the continuum
density of states due to the interaction. a simple and general argument connects () to

the phase shift (in our case only the s-wave contributes),

substituting (), and integrating by parts yields,

() =

the surface term in the integration by parts  () vanishes trivially at  = 0. for a
general problem the surface term at innity causes problems because generically ()  1/
as   . however, in the case of a separable potential, we shall see that the phase shift
vanishes rapidly as   , so the surface term can be ignored. so we may immediately
calculate the casimir energy if we are given the phase shift. eq. (30) and eq. (33) give

alternative representations of the casimir energy, which should both be equivalent to eq. (6)
for the separable case.

iv. casimir energy for the separable case

in this section we examine the greens function and phase shift representations of the

casimir energy for the separable case.

a. greens function representation

to exploit eq. (27) we need an explicit expression for the trace of the greens function

for the separable potential of section 2. we start with the lippmann-schwinger equation
for g,

g(~r,~r, ) = g0(~r,~r, ) + z d3r1 d3r2 g0(~r,~r1, )u(r1)u(r2)g(~r2,~r, )

(34)

which may be solved by iteration,

g(~r,~r, ) = z d3r1 d3r2 g0(~r,~r1, )u(~r)(cid:2)1+x()+x()2+   (cid:3) u(~r)g0(~r2,~r, ) (35)

where x() was dened in eq. (17).

eq. (27) requires the us to set ~r = ~r and integrate. if we substitute from eq. (35) the

result takes a particularly simple form,

r.l. jae and l.r. williamson

z d3r g(~r,~r, ) =

ln (1  x())

(36)

(37)

where we have identied the generic function f () of eq. (28) with  ln (1  x()) in the
separable case. [with this identication it is easy to check that the surface terms discussed
following eq. (29) do indeed vanish.] to evaluate the integral we need lim ln (1 x()).
from eq. (17) and the normalization of u(r), it is easy to see that as   ,

thus,

ln (1  x())  x()  / .

ec = 



4i ic

= 

(38)

(39)

conrming the value of the casimir energy is /2 as we derived in section 1 from more
formal considerations.

some comments are in order:

 the method we have presented is equivalent to the usual, graphical analysis of the
eective action in quantum eld theory. had we begun with a theory describing a
scalar eld, , propagating in a scalar background, , then the casimir energy would

have been given by the (innite) sum of one-loop graphs for  with insertions of
the / coupling. the one-loop graphs could then be resummed into a lippmann
schwinger equation for g(~r,~r, ). the special advantages of a separable potential are
(a) that the resulting integral equation for g is solvable, and (b) that there are no
ultraviolet divergences (seen as divergences in the    limit) to complicate the
calculation.

 the resummation of 1 + x + x 2 +   that generated the logarithm in eq. (36) is valid
for small  where the series converges. the result can then be analytically continued

to large  were the re-expansion into a (born) series does not converge.

b. phase shift representation

in section 3 we also derived a simple representation, eq. (33), for the casimir energy as
a sum over binding energies and an integral over the phase shift (). in this subsection we

r.l. jae and l.r. williamson

10

show explicitly that this representation is equivalent to the greens function representation
as found, for example, in eq. (37).

first, we return to the contour, c, of fig. 1,

ec = 

1

4i ic

d ln (1  x()).

(40)

the contour integral is equivalent to integrating the discontinuity in the integrand across
the real axis from just below the lowest bound state 0 to ,

ec =

1

2 z 

0

d im ln (1  x( + i))

(41)

where we have used the fact that the discontinuity in the logarithm is 2i times its imaginary
part.

there are two distinct regions in the integral. for  < 0, x() is explicitly real, and
the logarithm can have an imaginary part if and only if x() > 1. for  > 0, x() always

has an imaginary part (see eq. (17)) related to the scattering amplitude. we shall show
that these two contributions map into the binding energy and integral over the phase shift
respectively, as expected from eq. (33).

first consider   0. according to the analysis of section 2, eqs. (21) and (22), etc.,
x() takes its maximum at  = 0, and decreases as  decreases. if x(0) > 1 there is a
single bound state with binding energy, b  0, determined by the equation x(b) = 1.
thus if  is large enough to generate a bound state, then ln (1  x()) has an imaginary
part (equal to ) for b    0. thus

d im ln (1  x()) =  1

next consider  > 0. from the analysis of section 2, we nd

0 dq |0(q)|2/(q2  )(cid:19)

1  4-r 

which is just  tan (k) as dened in eq. (19). substituting from eqs. (42) and (44) into
eq. (41), we conrm the phase shift plus binding energy representation, eq. (33),

v. convergence and numerical issues in a separable

potential model

a particular virtue of the separable potential model is that it is simple enough to allow
us to investigate issues that are dicult to attack in more realistic theories. as an example

of such an issue, we consider here some computational aspects of phase shift representation
of the casimir energy. ref. [2] introduced a method of computing the casimir energy

in realistic quantum eld theories based on the born approximation to the phase shift.
divergences generated by the lowest-order feynman diagrams are associated with the rst
few terms in the born approximation to the phase shift. to remove the divergences from

the numerical part of the calculation, the rst few born approximations are subtracted from
the phase shift. these contributions are then added back into the calculation in the form of

(divergent) feynman diagrams, which are regulated and renormalized by means of available
counterterms. schematically

ec =  1

(46)

where n is the phase shift with the rst n terms in the born approximation subtracted,

() = ()

n(n)()

(47)

dn is the contribution to ec from the nth-order feynman diagram, and ct denotes the
renormalization counterterms. both the {dn} and the counterterms depend on a cuto if
the theory has ultraviolet divergences. the born-subtracted phase shift, however, is cuto
independent.

in realistic quantum eld theory applications the feynman diagrams, {dn}, and the
counterterms are calculated by standard, diagrammatic methods. the integral over n
is done numerically. the born approximations {n(n)} have just the right behavior to
cancel the large  tail of () and render the -integral convergent. however they are a
poor approximation to () for small , especially in partial waves where there are bound
states. [3] numerical studies show that at low  the function n () is much larger than
0 d n (). the origin of this eect is obscured in those studies because
0 d (n)(), diverge. the large
 behavior of the separable potential model is very soft, enabling us to study this issue
explicitly.

its integral r 
the integral over the individual born approximations, r 

it is convenient to specialize further to a particular choice of the separable potential

function, u(r). following gottfried, we choose the yukawa function,

it is convenient to use the momentum, k, rather than  = k2 as the independent variable,
also to introduce scaled variables, k/  z, /2  g, and nally, it is easiest to explore the
model by studying the scattering amplitude, f (k)  f (g, z) = 1/(cot (g, z)  i),

f (g, z) =

(50)

2gz

(1 + iz)2((1  iz)2  g)

the scattering amplitude f (g, z) has two types of singularities. the double pole at
z = i is a potential singularity arising from the fourier transform of u(r), 0(k). it is
on the second sheet of the complex  plane where it does not aect the contour shifting

arguments we used earlier in this paper. the other singularities are poles at

z = 


i(g  1)
i(g + 1).

.

(51)

for g > 1, z+ is associated with a bound state:
it lies on the positive imaginary axis,
corresponding to the negative real axis on the rst sheet of the complex -plane.2 the
energy of the bound state is 0 = 2z2
second sheet and is not dynamically important. the singularities in the complex-z plane

 = (  )2. the pole at z is always on the

are summarized (for g > 1) in fig. 2.

with these considerations in mind, we can write an illuminating expression for the

casimir energy,

(52)

i.e., where there is a bound state, it appears explicitly in ec. the born approximation is an
expansion of (g, z) in powers of g obtained by expanding the denominator of f (g, z) (see
eq. (50)) in a geometric series:

2for g < 1 the z+ pole lies on the negative imaginary axis, i.e., on the second sheet of the -plane.
as g  1 it becomes virtual state on its way to becoming a bound state.

r.l. jae and l.r. williamson

13

fig. 2. the born expansion converges outside a circle of radius g centered at i in the complex
z-plane. singularities in f (g, z) at z = i, z+ = i(g  1), and z = i(g + 1) are shown.

(g, z) =



xn=1

gn(n)(z) .

(53)

the convergence of the born expansion is determined by the convergence of the geometric

series for f (g, z), which converges provided |1  iz| > g. that is, z must lie outside the
circle of radius g centered at z = i. to compute the casimir energy by the phase shift
method, we must integrate over all  > 0, corresponding to z  [0,].

as long as g < 1 ( < 2) the born expansion converges for all real, positive z and can

be used under the integral sign in eq. (52) to compute ec,

this is a remarkable result: both sides are power series in , but the left hand side consists
of a single term. we conclude that, for  < 2, when there is no bound state, the entire
casimir energy is given by the rst born approximation, and that the integrals over all

higher born approximations to the phase shift vanish:

this result may easily be veried numerically.

when g > 1 ( > 2), it is no longer possible to use the born approximation to evaluate
the -integral. a glance at the second equation in eq. (52) conrms that the born approxi-
mation cannot converge when there is a bound state: if it did, it would yield a result analytic
in , however the -integral must generate a factor  to cancel the contribution of the

still, it is useful to subtract some number of terms in the born expansion from the exact
phase shift (n () = () p

n=1 n(n)()) and to rewrite ec accordingly,

here we have subtracted the rst n terms in the born approximation to convert  to
n . when we added them back in, we used the fact that the integral of the rst born
approximation gives exactly  1
2, and that the integrals of all higher born approximations
vanish. from this analysis we conclude that when there is a bound state, the integral of the
born subtracted phase shift, n gives an n-independent contribution to ec,

exact result, the four dashed curves give the rst four born approximations respectively.

the casimir energy is given entirely by the rst born approximation (which, in a theory
with divergences, would be computed from a feynman graph). the nth born approximation
gives a contribution to  of order gn, which may be large for g . 1, but its integrated
contribution to the casimir energy is exactly zero. in more complicated theories the answer

is very small but not exactly zero. [3] the magnitude of the eect can be seen in fig. 3,
where we plot the exact phase shift and the rst four born approximations for g = 0.99.

the rst born approximation has the same integral as the full phase shift. each higher born
approximation integrates to zero. the situation becomes even more bizarre in when there is
a bound state. the entire casimir energy is still given by the rst born approximation! the

bound state contribution is exactly canceled by the remainder of the phase shift integral.
one can remove any number of further born approximations from   dening n , which is
signicantly modied by the subtraction of higher born approximations  without changing
the integral. the eect can be seen in fig. 4, where we plot the exact phase shift and the
rst four born approximations for g = 4.5. once again the toy model caricatures eects

seen in more complex and more realistic theories.

vi. summary and conclusions

our principal purpose has been to develop a simple model to obtain insight into com-
plicated calculations of casimir energies in quantum eld theories. we have veried in our

separable potential model that several traditional representations of the casimir energy em-
ployed in quantum eld theories are equivalent. our model is very simple. in particular, it

does not display the divergences characteristic of real quantum eld theories. thus we are
not surprised that results are conrmed in our model that might be spoiled by divergences

in more realistic theories. nevertheless, the model is rich enough to illustrate some of the
computational diculties that have been seen numerically in more complicated theories.

also, we should point out that there are cases where separable potentials do arise in the
treatment of more realistic theories. in particular, bashinsky has shown that the collective
coordinate quantization in theories with solitons introduces additional, separable-potential-

like terms into the small oscillations hamiltonian whose eigenvalues determine the casimir
energy. [4] the ideas developed here would apply relatively directly to such cases.
