abstract: we provide a classication of the iib dp- and nsp-branes in which the brane action
exists due to a non-trivial class of the chevalley-eilenberg cohomology of free dierential algebras.
we then present a new geometric formulation of the iib dp- and nsp-branes (p  5) in which the
manifestly superinvariant wess-zumino terms are constructed in terms of the supersymmetric cur-
rents. the supercurrents are obtained by using supergroup manifolds corresponding to the iib-brane
superalgebra, which is characterized by the generators of d3-, d5-, ns5- and kk5-branes in addition
to the previously introduced generators of supertranslations, f- and d-strings. the charges of d1-,
f1- and d3-branes are related to those of the m-algebra, but some charges of d5- and ns5-branes are
not. the s-duality of the type-iib theory is realized as transformations of the supercurrents gener-
alizing the so(2) r-symmetry of the superalgebra. we thus nd that the superalgebra is lifted into
twelve-dimensions with signature (11,1).

it is now widely appreciated that super p-branes play an important role in studying non-perturbative
superstring physics [1, 2]. the existence of a p-brane is guaranteed by the existence of the correspond-
ing wess-zumino (wz) term, which is needed for the -symmetry, or the matching of the bosonic
and fermionic degrees of freedom on the worldvolume [3]. the wz term is determined by a closed
(p + 2)-form which is shown to be characterized by non-trivial chevalley-eilenberg (p + 2)-cocycles on
the ordinary superspace [4]. these wz term was shown to cause topological charges and modify the
super poincare algebra [5]. in the spacetime superalgebra, p-branes are expressed as p-form central
charges [6, 7, 8, 9].

it is known that the wz action iw z = r lw z is superinvariant, but the integrand lw z is not.
the wz term lw z is superinvariant up to a total derivative term. a manifestly supersymmetric

1

formulation of the green-schwarz superstring, including the wz term, was given by siegel [10] based
on a superalgebra [11] which is the global limit of a superalgebra [12] found by himself. the superal-
gebra is a generalization of super poincare algebra and generated by generators of supertranslations
(pa, q) and those of f-strings (z a, z ), where z  is a new fermionic generator. constructing a
suitable set of supercurrents on the corresponding supergroup manifold, he wrote down the wz term
of the green-schwarz superstring in a second order expression of the supercurrents. using this for-
mulation, p-branes (p > 1), found in the brane scan [3], were formulated by bergshoe and sezgin
[13].
introducing the p-brane superalgebras generated by generators of supertranslation and those
of p-brane (z a1ap, . . . , z 1p), they wrote down the manifestly supersymmetric wz terms for the
p-branes, which are (p + 1)-th order in the supercurrents (further discussions on the superalgebra
are found in [14]). for the non-minimal type-ii theories, type-ii superstrings and iib d-strings [15],
iib (p, q)-strings [16, 17] and iia d2-brane [18] are formulated by introducing the corresponding su-
peralgebras. in [15], it was pointed out that worldvolume gauge elds can be expressed in terms of
coordinates corresponding to new generators. this was further investigated in [17, 18].

in this paper, we generalize them to incorporate all the branes in the type-iib theory. the
type-iib theory is chiral with 16+16 majorana-weyl supercharges with the same chirality. the 528
components of the anti-commutator of the supercharges are distributed as

528 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 120 + 126 + 126 + 126,

among the components of generators: translations, d-strings (d9-branes), f-strings (neveu-schwarz
(ns) 9-branes), d3-branes (d7- and ns7-branes), d5-branes, ns5-branes and kaluza-klein (kk)
5-branes, respectively, where branes in the parentheses correspond to charges with a time index. it
is shown that the wz terms for dp- and nsp-branes are characterized by chevalley-eilenberg (ce)
cohomology on the ordinary superspace. the obtained wz terms are equivalent to those obtained in
[19], and the total actions are invariant under the -symmetry. in order to formulate the wz action
to be manifestly superinvariant, we introduce new generators with spinorial indices in exchange for
lorentz indices of bosonic brane charges of the superalgebra with the maximal central extension, and
provide new spacetime superalgebra, the iib-brane superalgebra. the iib-brane superalgebra contains
various subalgebras found before: n=1 p-brane superalgebra [10, 13], the iib-superstring superalgebra
[15], etc. the d1, f1, d3-brane and kk5-brane charges are obtained by a t-duality from those in
the m-algebra found in [20], but the d5- and ns5-brane charges with ve spinorial indices are not. in
this sence, the iib-brane superalgebra is a generalization of the m-algebra. by using the iib-brane
superalgebra, we show that the iib dp- and nsp-branes (p  5) can be formulated in a manifestly
superinvariant way. namely, the wz terms are found to be written down in terms of the supercurrents
on the supergroup manifold corresponding to the superalgebra. new coordinates associated with new
generators are contained in a surface term, by virtue of the ber bundle structure of our superalgebra
with the ordinary superspace being the base space. the wz actions of the superinvariant wz terms
are equivalent to those obtained in the ce cohomology classication. thus, the total actions are
-invariant. the iib-brane superalgebra enjoys the so(2) symmetry, which is a generalization of the
so(2) r-symmetry, and thus the s-duality is generalized to include new generators. the s-duality is
shown to be realized geometrically in twelve-dimensions.

this paper is organized as follows. we begin with showing that the iib wz terms are characterized
by the ce cohomology in sec. 2. we introduce two free dierential algebras, which turn out to
correspond to d-branes and ns-branes. the obtained wz terms are shown to be equivalent to those
of the -invariant d/ns p-brane actions found before. in sec. 3, introducing a set of new spacetime

2

superalgebras, we construct the superinvariant wz terms for d- and ns-branes using the supercurrents
on the corresponding group manifolds. the properties of superalgebras and the relations to the m-
algebra are discussed in sec. 4. it is shown that this iib-brane superalgebra enjoys so(2) symmetry.
the superalgebra is found to be lifted into twelve-dimensions with signature (11,1), while realizing the
so(2) symmetry geometrically, in sec. 5. the last section is devoted to a summary and discussions.

2. chevalley-eilenberg cohomology classication of iib-branes

the wz term lw z is known to be superinvariant up to a total derivative term. it follows that (p + 2)-
form hp+2  dlw z is superinvariant. for the p-branes [4] and the iia dp-branes [18], the (p + 2)-form
hp+2 were characterized by being a non-trivial ce cohomology (p + 2)-cocycles on superspace. in this
section, we give a classication of the iib dp-branes and the iib nsp-branes using the ce cohomology
[21].

for the type-iib theory, the poincare superalgebra is generated by the translation generator pa

and 16+16 majorana-weyl supercharges (q, q ) with the same chirality, as 1

{q, q} = (a1)pa,

[pa, q] = [pa, pb] = 0,

(2.1)

where as are the ten-dimensional -matrices satisfying {a, b} = 2ab and 1 acts on a column
vector q =(cid:0)q 
q(cid:1). the left-invariant (li) maurer-cartan one-form a is dened by ata = u1du ,
where u is a group element and t a collectively denotes the generators of the algebra. let (xa, )
be the coordinates on the corresponding group manifold, the li one-form is expressed as a = dxa +
2 (a1d) and  = d and provides a basis for the dierential forms on the group manifold. the
1
a, where z m denotes coordinates on the
li group vielbein lm
supergroup manifold. similarly, the right-invariant (ri) maurer-cartan one-form a is dened by
ata = du u1, and the ri group vielbein rm
a is read o from a = dz m rm
a. the ri generators
m m , are regarded as the supertranslation generators,
qa of the left-translation, written as qa = ra
m m , are regarded as the
while the li generators da of the right-translation, written as da = la
supercovariant derivatives. the li one-form a is invariant under the supertranslations.

a is read o from a = dz m lm

in order to classify the iib dp-branes, we introduce two-form f, which is the modied eld
strength of the nsns two-form gauge potential as well as the li one-form a. the non-trivial
(p + 2)-cocycles are given by closed (p + 2)-forms hp+2(a, ,  ,f) which can not be written as
the dierential of a (p + 1)-form constructed from a, ,   and f. the possible wz terms will
be characterized as some non-trivial (p + 2)-cocycles of the cohomology of a certain free dierential
algebra (fda).

let us consider the fda f generated by a, ,  ,f and dened by the structure relations:

da = 
d = 0,
df = a(a3).

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

the wedge product  is to be understood here and henceforth. given a super q-form g, the exterior
derivative acts as follows: d(f  g) = f  dg + (1)qdf  g. the nilpotency dd = 0 is satised by
1the notation and conventions are similar to [6]. the vector indices sare a = 0, 1, . . . , 9 and the spinor indices are

, . the charge conjugation matrix is c and a1 an = [1    an].

the fierz identity: (a1)((a3)) = 0. the superinvariant closed (p + 2)-form can be expanded in
terms of the two-form f as

hp+2 =

[ p+2
2 ]

xn=0

n!

h(p+22n)(a, )f n,

(2.5)

where h(p+22n) is a (p + 2  2n)-form written in terms of a and . assigning dimension [a] = l,
[] = l1/2, [f] = l2, [hp+2] = lp+1, to avoid introducing extra dimensionful constants, one writes
the k-form h(k) with dimension lk1 as

h(k) = a(k)a1  ak2(a1ak2 (k)),

(2.6)

where a(k) is a constant and (k) is a 2 2 matrix determined below. note that (a1ak2 (k))
is non-vanishing when

(k) = 1, 3, 1 for k  2 = 1 mod 4,
(k) = i2
for k  2 = 3 mod 4.

(2.7)

this immediately implies that there are no non-trivial (p+2)-cocycles when p = even. this is consistent
with the fact that the iib d and ns p-branes exist only when p =odd. thus, the closed-ness condition
dhp+2 = 0 reduces to conditions

dh(1) = 0,

dh(k) + h(k2)df = 0,

k = 3, 5, 7, . . . , p + 2.

(2.8)

as a result, we nd that the non-trivial hp+2 is constructed on the fda f in terms of

h(1) = 0,
h(3) = aa(a1),

h(5) = a

h(7) = a

h(9) = a

in the course to obtain the above

majorana-weyl spinors with the same chirality, fierz identity is expressed as

where  = 019. in particular, hp+2 is closed due to the fierz identities for dp-branes:

d-string : (a)((a)) = 0,
d3-brane : (c)((abc)) + 2([a)((b])) = 0,
d5-brane : (b)( (a1a4b)) + 4([a1 )((a2a3a4])) = 0,
d7-brane : (b)( (a1a6b)) + 6([a1 )((a2a6])) = 0.

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

the (anti-) symmetrization with a unit weight of indices in parentheses (square brackets) is understood.
for d9-branes, the fierz identity is

d9-brane : (b)((a1a8b)) + 8([a1 )((a2a8])) = 0

(2.21)

while h(11) is formally eleven-dimensional. h(11) is characterized by a(11) = 24
9! a and (11) = 1. the
fierz identities (2.20) and (2.21) are obtained from (2.19) and (2.18) respectively. one nds that the
fierz identities for dp-brane are collectively expressed as

(b)((a1ap1b)) + (p  1)([a1 )((a2ap1])) = 0.

(2.22)

in order to see that the obtained (p + 2)-forms are not ce cohomology trivial, we note that if there
were (p + 1)-forms b(a, ,f) such that db = hp+2, then bs would be lorentz invariant (p + 1)-forms
with dimensions [b] = lp+1. one sees that such a b does not exist.

d-brane actions, which are -invariant, have been proposed in [22, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26]. we show
that our action is -invariant by relating our action to the -invariant action of [19]. rescaling
supercurrents as a  ka,   l, where k = 12
and kl2 = 1, (2.2) is transformed into
a = (a1) and (2.3) and (2.4) are unchanged. these are normalizations of supercurrents
used in [19]. in this normalization, numerical coecients of h(k), k = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, are expressed as
1, 1
9! , respectively. one nd that the (p + 2)-forms hp+2 constructed from these h(k) are
identical to those of wz terms obtained in [19]. it follows that, introducing the dirac-born-infeld
action idbi as (3.1), the combined actions, i = idbi + iw z, are shown to be -invariant as was done
there, but we do not repeat this here. in this way, we nd that -invariant iib dp-brane actions are
characterized by using the ce cohomology.

in order to classify the wz terms for nsp-branes, we consider the fda g generated by a, ,g

and dened by the structure relations

(a1),

da = 
d = 0,
dg = a(a1)
where g turns out to be the modied eld strength of the ramondramond (rr) two-form gauge
h(p+22n)(a, )gn where h(k) is

expressed as h(k) = b(k)a1  ak2 (a1ak2(k)). solving dhp+2 = 0:
k = 2, 3, 7, . . . , p + 2,

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

where b is a constant to be set being 1 below. the (p + 2)-forms hp+2 constructed from these h(k)s are
shown to be ce cohomology non-trivial, as before. as will be seen in the next section, hp+2 is related
to hp+2 by the s-duality. we regard the branes associated to the wz terms characterized by the above
as the iib ns-branes. for the 3-brane, we call it d3-brane since the wz term is transformed to that
of the d3-brane by a vector-vector duality on the worldvolume gauge eld (see sec. 3.2). the 7-branes
will be regarded as the ns7-branes.

hp+2 is closed due to fierz identities :

(a)( (a)) = 0,

f-string :
d3-brane : (c)( (abc)) + 2([a)((b])) = 0,

ns5-brane : ( (b)((a1a4b)) = 0,

(b)(a1a4b)   (b) (a1a4b) + 16([a1 )(a2a3a4])  = 0,

ns7-brane : (b)((a1a6b)) + 6([a1a5 )((a6])) = 0.

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

(2.35)

in the second line of (2.34), the symmetrization of (, ) and that of (, ) are understood. note that
(2.20) is dierent from (2.35) while h(9) is the same as h(9). the identity (2.35) is obtained from (2.19)
and the rst line of (2.34).

for ns9-branes, the fierz identity is

ns9-brane : ( (b)((a1a8b)) = 0,

(b)(a1a8b)   (b) (a1a8b) + 32([a1 )(a2a8])  = 0,

(2.36)

while h(11) is formally eleven-dimensional. one nds that h(11) is characterized by b(11) = 24
(11) = 3. the second line of (2.36) is obtained from

9! b and

([a)(b])  + (c)(ab

c)  = 0,

(2.37)

where the symmetrization of (, ) and that of (, ) are understood. we nd that the fierz identities
for ns/d p-branes are collectively expressed as

(a1ap1bi2

p+1

2 )((b1)) + (p  1)([a1ap2i2

p1

2 )((ap1] )) = 0,

(2.38)

where  = 1 for nsp-branes and  = 3 for dp-branes. in this way, we have classied the wz terms
for nsp-branes. denoting the obtained wz action as iw z and introducing idbi as (3.7), one expects
that the combined actions, i = idbi + iw z, are shown to be -invariant. in fact, i can be rewritten
as the -invariant actions i by the redenition of supercurrents:   , where  = 12
(1 + i2),
as will be seen in sec.3. we expect that the same procedure employed in showing the -invariance of
dp-branes will work here.

we have classied closed superinvariant (p + 2)-forms hp+2 and hp+2, and then the wz term lw z
for dp-branes and lw z for nsp-branes, respectively. in the next section, we construct the wz terms
for dp- and nsp-branes (p  5) in a manifestly supersymmetric way.

3. supersymmetric wess-zumino terms

we construct the manifestly superinvariant wz terms using the supercurrents on the supergroup
manifolds of the corresponding superalgebras. we discuss the relations of these superalgebras to the
m-algebra and the iia superalgebra in the next section.

the dp-brane action is composed of the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action and the wz action. the

dbi action is (background scalars are omitted)

idbi =zmp+1

dp+1qdet(a
where mp+1 is the worldvolume of the dp-brane and a
is the pullback to the worldvolume of the
supercurrent corresponding to translations. the two-form f is the modied eld strength of the
nsns two-form gauge potential b(2), and dened by f = db b(2), where b is the born-infeld u(1)
gauge eld on the worldvolume. the dbi action is manifestly supersymmetric.

the wz action for dp-branes is dened as

ef  c,

c = mn

c(n),

(3.2)

where c(n) is characterized by the pullback to the worldvolume of the n-form rr gauge potential
c(n).2 the wz action iw z is superinvariant. the invariance is however not manifest, since the
integrand dened by lw z  [ef  c]p+1 is not superinvariant. the wz term is said to be quasi-
superinvariant; superinvariant up to a total divergence, lw z = do. we show that the wz term for
dp-branes can be constructed to be manifestly superinvariant in terms of supersymmetric currents on
the corresponding supergroups. to do this, we recall that we have introduced hp+2 as hp+2 = dlw z
in the previous section. it follows that

h(3) = dc(2),
h(5) = dc(4) + dfc(2),
h(7) = dc(6) + dfc(4),
h(9) = dc(8) + dfc(6).

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

we determine c(k), k = 2, 4, 6, by solving the above equations recursively in terms of supersymmetric
currents on the supergroups manifolds corresponding to spacetime superalgebras for d-strings, d3-
branes and d5-branes, respectively.

for nsp-branes, the dbi action is expressed as (omitting the background scalar elds)

idbi =zmp+1

dp+1qdet(a

(3.7)

and is manifestly superinvariant. the g is dened by g = dc  c(2), where c(2) is the rr two-form
gauge potential and c is a worldvolume gauge eld. instead of the dbi action, one can use the kinetic
term of the green-schwarz action for f-strings, which is manifestly supersymmetric too. we dene
wz action as

iw z = zmp+1

eg  b,

b = b(0)  b(2) + b(4)  b(6) + b(8)  b(10).

(3.8)

2we do not distinguish spacetime gauge potentials and the pullback to the worldvolume of them, but use the same

characters, throughout this paper.

7

we have introduced hp+2 as hp+2 = d lw z in the previous section. it follows that

h(3) = db(2),
h(5) = db(4)  dgb(2),
h(7) = db(6) + dgb(4),
h(9) = db(8)  dgb(6).

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

we show that b(k), k = 2, 4, 6, can be constructed in terms of supersymmetric currents on the super-
groups manifolds corresponding to spacetime superalgebras for f-strings, d3-branes and ns5-branes,
respectively.

3.1 d- and f-strings

in order for the present paper to be self-contained, we begin with describing the iib d- and f-strings
following [15, 16].

for d-strings, we introduce li maurer-cartan (mc) equations corresponding to supertranslations:

and d-strings:

da =  1
d = 0,

2 (a1),

2 (a1),

da =  1
d = a(a1)  a(a1),

(3.13)

(3.14)

which are t-dual to the mc equations for d0- and d2-branes obtained from the m-algebra as will be
seen in sec. 4.2. mc equations contain equivalent information about the algebra:

[da, db} = fab

cdc  dc = 

1
2

b  afab

c,

(3.15)

where da is dual to a and denotes the li generators of the right-transformation collectively. the
structure constants of the supersymmetry algebra generated by the ri generators qa of the left-
transformation is identical to those of the algebra generated by the li generators da of the right-
transformation up to a sign. keeping this in mind, we call the mc equations of the li one-forms
the dual to the superalgebra for short, throughout this paper. the jacobi identities of the algebra
are satised if and only if the integrability conditions d2 = 0 on the dual forms hold. we call the
superalgebra corresponding to (3.13) and (3.14) the d-string superalgebra. the supersymmetric wz
term lw z = c(2) for d-strings is constructed in terms of these supercurrents on the corresponding
supergroup manifold as3

c(2) = aa

2

.

(3.16)

in fact, one can see that dc(2) = a(a1), and then h3 = h(3), which is (2.10) given by the
fda f, is obtained. this is consistent with (2.25) of the fda g.

3this (pullback of the) two-form gauge potential c(2) is not used for the d-string action, rather is used for (p, q)-string

action. we do not distinguish between them throughout this paper.

in turn for f-strings, mc equations for supertranslation (3.13) and f-strings:

2 (a3)

da = + 1
d = +a(a3)  a(a1),

(3.17)

are needed. we call the corresponding superalgebra the f-string superalgebra.
in terms of these
supercurrents on the corresponding supergroup manifold, supersymmetric wz term lw z = b(2) for
f-strings is constructed by

b(2) = aa

in fact, one can get db(2) = a(a3), and then h3 = h(3), which is (2.28) obtained from
the fda g. this is consistent with (2.4) of the fda f.
new coordinates for d- and f-string charges are contained in a total derivative term. h(3) and
h(3) can be regarded as the pullback to the worldvolume of the eld strengths of the spacetime
gauge potentials, h(3) = dc(2) and g(3) = db(2), which are invariant under the spacetime gauge
transformations

c(2) = d(1),

b(2) = d(1).

(3.19)

we regard b(2) and c(2) as (the pullback to the worldvolume of) the spacetime gauge potentials b(2)
and c(2), respectively. the s-duality

b(2)  c(2),

c(2)  b(2),

(3.20)

maps the f-string wz term lw z to the d-string one lw z. the s-duality transformations (3.20) can
be expressed as a set of transformations of the supercurrents:

a  a, a  a, a  a,   ,   ,   ,

3.2 d3-branes

for d3-branes, we introduce mc equations:

(3.22)

in addition to mc equations for supertranslations (3.13), f-strings (3.17) and d-strings (3.14). we call
the superalgebra corresponding to (3.13), (3.17), (3.14) and (3.22) the d3-brane superalgebra. the
mc equations (3.22) are t-dual to those of d2-branes and d4-branes obtained from the m-algebra as
will be seen in sec. 4.3.

(3.26)

and the right hand side is the h(5) found in (2.11), that is dlw z = h5. this supersymmetric wz term
is equivalent to the wz term obtained in sec. 2 up to a total derivative. new coordinates are contained
in a surface term as was shown in the case of f- and d-strings. to see this, we introduce coordinates
xa and  on the supergroup manifold associated with the generators for the supertranslations pa and
q, respectively. one nds that for any parametrization of the supergroup manifold the supercurrents
2 (a1d) and  = d, because of the ber bundle structure
a and  are expressed as a = dxa + 1
of our superalgebra with the ordinary superspace characterized by (3.13) being the base space. this
implies that the terms containing new coordinates in lw z are eliminated by an exterior derivative d
and thus contained in a surface term. this is a universal property of our formulation.

we can construct the wz term for d3-branes in a dierent form. the supersymmetric wz term

is

where

lw z = b(4)  g  b(2)

b(4) = c(4) 

1

c(2)b(2).

in fact, one can show that

a1 a2a3 (a1a2a3i2),

(3.27)

(3.28)

(3.29)

and the right hand side is the h(5) found in (2.29). we have shown that d lw z = h5 and new
coordinates are contained in a surface term as was seen above. the superinvariant wz terms lw z
and lw z are equivalent to those obtained in sec. 2 up to a total derivative, and thus the total actions
are -invariant.
now let us comment on the relation between lw z and lw z. first, i = idbi +iw z is transformed
to i = idbi + iw z by a vector-vector duality transformation [27, 28], b  c. we add a lagrange
multiplier term 1
ij ) to i. solving for bi implies that ij = ijklkcl, where
ci is a vector eld dual to bi and turns out to be the worldvolume gauge eld associated with the
rr two-form c(2). one obtains i after eliminating fij using the equations of motion. the term

2 ij(fij  2ibj + b(2)

10

c(2)b(2) emerged in (3.24) and (3.28) in our formulation. this is consistent with the spacetime gauge

1

transformations as will be seen below.

second, the action i is mapped to the action i under the s-duality transformations: (3.20) and

c(4)  c(4),

g  f, f  g,

c  b,

b  c.

(3.30)

(3.31)

these two imply that i is self-dual by itself under the s-duality and the worldvolume vector-vector
duality transformation. the same is true for i.

third, h(5) and h(5) are identical from the expression in terms of the supercurrents as well as
the spacetime gauge potentials. these are regarded as the pullback to the worldvolume of the eld
strength h(5) of the spacetime gauge potential c(4)

h(5) = dc(4) 

1
2

c(2)db(2) +

b(2)dc(2).

2

(3.32)

the bianchi identity is dh(5)  h(3)g(3) = 0, which corresponds to dh(5) + h(3)df = 0 of (2.8) or
dh(5) + h(3)dg = 0 of (2.26). h(5) is invariant under the spacetime gauge transformations: (3.19) and

c(4) = d(3) +

1
2

d(1)b(2) 

1
2

d(1)c(2).

(3.33)

f and g are gauge invariant by denition of the gauge transformations of the worldvolume gauge
elds b and c: b = d + (1) and c = d + (1), where  and  are worldvolume scalars. the gauge
invariances of iw z and iw z are equivalent to the gauge quasi-invariances of lw z and lw z, and then
to the gauge invariances, h(5) = h(3) = 0 and h(5) = h(3) = 0. these are guaranteed by the gauge
invariances of h(5), h(3) and g(3).

finally, the s-duality transformations (3.30) can be expressed as a set of transformations of

supercurrents: (3.21) and

abc  abc, ab  ab(), a  a()(),   ()()(),

(3.34)

where ab() = (cid:0)ab 

and thus the s-duality is realized as an automorphism of the d3-brane superalgebra, as will be seen
in the sec. 4.3.

ab(cid:1) etc. these transformations are shown to be the generalized r-symmetry,

3.3 d5- and ns5-branes

for d5-branes, we begin with mc equations listed in the appendix a, in addition to those for super-
translations (3.13), f-strings (3.17), d-strings (3.14) and d3-branes (3.22). we call the corresponding
superalgebra the d5-brane superalgebra. we nd that the supersymmetric wz terms for d5-branes
can be constructed in terms of the supercurrents on the corresponding supergroup manifold as

ns5-branes respectively. the total actions are identical to those found in sec. 2 up to a surface term,
and -invariant.

12

the relations of the superinvariant wz terms of ns5- and d5-branes are as follows. h(7) and h(7)
are regarded as the pullback to the worldvolume of the eld strengths h(7) and g(7) of the spacetime
gauge potentials c(6) and b(6)

(3.44)

which correspond to dh(7) + h(5)df = 0 of (2.8) and dh(7) + h(5)dg = 0 of (2.26). the eld strengths
(3.43) are invariant under the spacetime gauge transformations: (3.19), (3.33) and

the gauge invariances of i and i are assured by h(7) = 0 and h(7) = 0, which are guaranteed by the
gauge transformations (3.19), (3.33), (3.45) and (3.46). thus we have obtained the gauge invariant,
-invariant and manifestly superinvariant iib d/ns5-brane action.

the wz terms lw z for d5-branes and lw z for ns5-branes are related by the s-duality: (3.20),

(3.30), (3.31) and

b(6)  c(6), c(6)  b(6).

(3.47)

under these transformations, the dbi actions idbi and idbi are interchanged, and thus the obtained
actions i and i are s-dual to each other. the s-duality transformations are expressed as transforma-
tions on the supercurrents as

(3.48)

these transformations are shown to be the generalized r-symmetry, and thus the s-duality is realized
as an automorphism of our superalgebra, as will be seen in the sec. 4.4 and 4.5.

3.4 reduction to n=(1,0)

our superalgebra contains n=(1,0) superalgebras as its subalgebra.

the f-string superalgebra corresponding to (3.13) and (3.17) is schematically described as

{q, q}  p +,

{q , q }  p ,

[q, p +]  z ,

[q , p ]  z ,

(3.49)

where p  denotes pa  z a. the quotient algebra with respect to the ideal {q , p , z } is the n=1
superalgebra found in [11]. the wz term for n=1 f-strings is characterized by h(3) = a(a).
one nds that the superinvariant wz term is expressed as lw z = b(2) where b(2) = aa 
1
2 . this agrees with the one found in [10].

13

keeping only q a, z a and z a1 a5, where a collectively denotes a and , in the ns5-brane super-
algebra, we obtain n=(1,0) ns5-brane superalgebra, which is similar to those obtained in [29] (with a
trivial scaling of 15). the wz term lw z is characterized by h(7) = 1
30 a1  a5 (a1a5).
the superinvariant wz term is lw z = b(6) where

b(6) =

4. the iib-brane superalgebra

in the previous section, we have introduced a set of superalgebras. let us derive and discuss these
superalgebras with keeping the relations to the m-algebra in this section.

foe this purpose, we briey describe the relation of branes in the type-iib theory to those in the
m-theory. eleven-dimensional m-theory contains 32 majorana supercharges q. the 528 components
of the anti-commutator {q, q} of the supercharges are decomposed into generators for translations,
m2-branes and m5-branes as 528 = 11 + 55 + 462:

11
translation
m2-brane (m9-brane)
55
m5-brane (mkk6-brane) z 15 462

p
z 

where , , . . . are eleven-dimensional lorentz indices. in the parentheses, we write the branes corre-
sponding to charges with a time index. one calls these branes m-branes collectively.

the iia-branes in ten-dimensions are obtained by a dimensional reduction of the m-branes with
respect to eleven-th direction, say -direction. the 32 components of majorana supercharges in eleven-
dimensions are reduced to 16+16 majorana-weyl spinors (q, q ) with the opposite chirality. the
iia-branes are related to the m-branes as

pa
translation
p
d0-brane
z a
f-string (ns9-brane)
z ab
d2-brane (d8-brane)
z a1a4 126 (84)
d4-brane (d6-brane)
ns5-brane (kk5-brane) z a1a5 126 (126)

9 (1)
1
9 (1)
36 (9)

where a, b, . . . are ten-dimensional lorentz indices. the generators for translations and d0-branes
originate from those for translations in eleven-dimensions, the generators for f-strings and d2-branes
from those for m2-branes, and the generators for d4-branes and ns5-branes from those for m5-branes.
the iib-branes are related to the above iia-branes under a t-duality transformation. the type-
iib theory is chiral, which has 16+16 majorana-weyl supercharges (q, q ) with the same chirality. in
order to change the chirality of a half of the iia supercharges, q  are multiplied by a ten-dimensional -
matrix , where the -direction is a space-like direction with respect to which a t-duality is performed.

14

one nds that the obtained algebra is rewritten in a ten-dimensional covariant form under the following
identications of the iib-brane charges and the m-brane charges:

pa
z a
a

translation
f-string (ns9-brane)
d-string (d9-brane)
d3-brane (ns/d7-brane) abc
d5-brane
ns5-brane
kk5-brane

= z i  p
= z i  p

where m runs all of the nine spacelike directions, but p runs except for the -direction. i runs ten
spacetime directions except for the -direction. the d5-, ns5- and kk5-brane charges are self-dual.
the  means the equivalence up to the self-duality relation. it follows that the s-duality in the
iib-branes is rephrased as a modular transformation on t 2 spanned by (, ).

4.1 m-algebra, iia-brane superalgebra and t-duality

the ordinary superspace, which is the supertranslation group (superpoincare/lorentz) generated
by qa = (pa, q) is regarded as a generalization of the spacetime which is the translation group
(poincare/lorentz) generated by pa (lorentz group is an automorphism of the algebra). we
now extend the ordinary superspace to those spanned by generators of p-branes z a1ap as well as
qa. in order to consider the relations of the iib-brane superalgebra to the m-algebra, we begin with
describing the m-algebra [20], which is an eleven dimensional superalgebra generated by4

supertranslation
m2-brane (m9-brane)
m5-brane (mkk6-brane) z m1m5  m1m5

 m
qm
z m n  m n

where eleven-dimensional lorentz indices  and 32-component majorana spinor indices  are collec-
tively denoted as m, n,, so that qm = (p, q), z m n = (z  , z , z ), etc. the right hand
sides of arrows denote the corresponding li one-form on the supergroup manifold.

the iia-brane superalgebra is obtained by a dimensional reduction of this m-algebra to ten-

dimensions, and generated by

a = (a, ,  )
a = (a, ,  )

qa
supertranslation
z a
f-string (ns9-brane)

d0-brane
ab  ab = (ab,)
d2-brane (d8-brane)
a1a4  a1a4 = (a1a4 ,)
d4-brane (d6-brane)
ns5-brane (kk5-brane) z a1a5  a1a5 = (a1a5,)

 = ()





where the indices a, b, collectively denote ten-dimensional lorentz indices a and 16-component
majorana-weyl spinor indices  and  with positive and negative chirality, respectively. branes
corresponding to the generators with a time index are listed in parentheses. dots denote the forms
with lorentz indices exchanged for spinorial indices of the corresponding forms.

4we omit superstring contained in the m-algebra.

15

in order to obtain the type-iib theory, we must take a t-dual with respect to a space-like direction
x. as a t-duality transformation (see [7]), we perform a dimensional reduction to nine-dimensions
with respect to x and change the chirality of dotted spinors by multiplying  as: a = () 
a 
etc.

one may apparently expect that the iib-brane superalgebra would be completely obtained by a
t-duality from the iia-brane superalgebra. we nd however that the generators of supertranslations,
f-strings, d-strings and d3-branes originate from those of the iia-brane superalgebra, but some
charges of iib d5- and iib ns5-branes are not obtained by a t-duality as will be seen below.

4.2 supertranslations, f-strings and d-strings

the superalgebra in presence of f-strings and/or d-strings are related to those in presence of f-strings
and/or d0- and d2-branes in the iia superalgebra under a t-duality. this is found to be rewritten
in a ten-dimensional covariant form under the identication [15]:

supertranslation qa  a = (i, ),  = ,
z a  a = (i, ),  = ,
f-string
a  a = (i,),  = .
d-string

(4.1)

the f-string superalgebra is generated by (qa, z a) and the corresponding mc equations are (3.13)
and (3.17). the d-string superalgebra is generated by (qa, a) and the corresponding mc equations
are (3.13) and (3.14). we denote these superalgebras as sp [z a] and sp [a], respectively. the jacobi
identities, or equivalently the integrability conditions d2 = 0, are guaranteed by the fierz identities:
(a)( (a)) = 0 for f-strings, and (a)((a)) = 0 for d-strings, which are encountered in (2.32)
and (2.17) in the ce cohomology classication of iib-branes.

the s-duality is expressed as a modular transformation on t 2 spanned by (, ). now, this
generalizes to include new fermionic generators  and . one nds that under the s-duality
transformation (3.21), the spacetime superalgebra (3.17) interchanges with (3.14) and (3.13) stays
invariant.

the superalgebra generated by generators listed in (4.1), denoting sp [z a, a], contains various
subalgebras. noting that new fermionic generators are the centers of the algebra sp [z a, a], and
that z a and a are the centers of the algebra sp [z a, a], one nds

   sp [z a, a] (cid:26)sp [z a]

sp [a]  sp,

(4.2)

where sp is generated by qa as (3.13). the superalgebra sp [z a, a] contains sp [z a] or sp [a] as
a subalgebra since z a and a are ideals of the algebra sp [z a, a]

sp [z a, a] 


sp [(cid:0)z z 
z a (cid:1),(cid:0)
a (cid:1)]
...
sp [(cid:0) z 
z a (cid:1),(cid:0) 
a (cid:1)]



sp [z a] ( sp [(cid:0)z 
z a (cid:1)]
z a (cid:1)]  sp [z a],
sp [(cid:0) z 
sp [a] ( sp [(cid:0)
a (cid:1)]
a (cid:1)]  sp [a],
sp [(cid:0)  

sp [z a, a] 

 sp.

(4.3)

due to the property that the superalgebras contain sp as a subalgebra, coordinates corresponding to
the generators z a and a are not contained in supercurrents a. the ber bundle structure with
the base space sp is a universal structure of our superalgebras.

16

4.3 d3-branes

the d3-brane charges with three bosonic indices are related to those of the wrapped d4-brane and
unwrapped d2-brane in the iia superalgebra, which are z p1p2 and z p1p2p3 in the m-algebra, where
pi runs 1 to 9 except for . we nd that the superalgebra obtained by a t-duality from the iia d2-
and d4-brane superalgebra is rewritten in a ten-dimensional covariant form and the d3-brane charges
abc are completely determined in terms of the charges in the m-algebra:

d3-brane abc 

abc = ( ijk = ijk, ij = ij),
abb = ( ij = ij, i = i),
a = ( i = i,  = ),
 = .

(4.4)




the s-duality, which is a modular transformation on t 2 spanned by (, ), generalizes to include new
fermionic generators ab, a and . we obtain the d3-brane superalgebra (dropping hats)
found in (3.22). jacobi identities are satised due to

(ab

c)((c)) + 2([a)((b])) = 0,

(4.5)

which is the characteristic identity of d3-branes, and encountered in (2.18) in the ce cohomology
classication of iib-branes.

the s-duality was expressed as a set of transformations of supercurrents: (3.21) and (3.34), which
is a generalization of the r-symmetry. we nd that these transformations leave the mc equations
(3.22) for d3-branes invariant. the s-duality associated with the generalized r-symmetry is realized
as an automorphism of our algebra.

interestingly, we nd that the existence of the d3-brane charges z abc in the superalgebra nec-
essarily requires the presence of the f-string charges z a and the d-string charges a, while the n=1
p-brane superalgebra [13] is generated by supertranslation and p-brane charges. this is a character-
istic feature of our superalgebras. this is consistent with the fact that the wz terms for d3-branes
are composed of the spacetime gauge potentials which couple to d3-branes, d-strings and f-strings,
or that the gauge eld strength of the four-form gauge potential which couples to d3-branes contains
the gauge potentials which couple to d-strings and f-strings.

the d3-brane superalgebra contains the f- and d-string superalgebras as subalgebras. in addi-
tion, the d3-brane superalgebra contains various subalgebras. we assign a degree (p; q, q) to the dual
form a1ap1q 1  q
of generators. under an operation of the dierential d, the forms with degree
(p; q, q) transform to those with degree:

(p + 1; q  2, q + 1),

(p + 2; q  2, q),
(p + 1; q  1, q),

(p + 2; q, q  2),
(p + 1; q, q  1),

(p + 1; q + 1, q  2),

(4.6)

and those with degree (p; q, q) where p + q + q = 1. in order to close an algebra, jacobi identities,
or equivalently d2 = 0, must be satised. a subalgebra is generated by the forms with degree (p; q, q),
those with degree (4.6) and those obtained by dierentiating the forms with degree (4.6). the new
generators  are the centers of the d3-brane superalgebra sp [z a, a, abc], and the new gener-
ators a are the centers of the subalgebra sp [z a, a, aab], and so on. in addition, z,  and
abc are center of the algebra sp [z a, a, abc]. in general, letting g be a lie algebra, the sequences
h0, h1, dened by h0  g, h1  [g, h], h2  [g, h1], , hn  [g, hn1], , is called the descending

17

central sequence. these satisfy h0  h1  h2    hn   and h0, h1, h2, are ideals in g.
in our case, the descending central sequence is h0 = sp [z a, a, abc ], h1 = {pa, z a, a, abc},
h2 = {z, , ab}, h3 = {a}, h4 = {} and h5 = {0}. our algebra is nilpotent and ide-
als h1, h2, h3 and h4 are said to be proper. especially, h4 is abelian ideal, said to be the center in
sp [z a, a, abc]. for a given ideal i, the quotient lie algebra is dened by g/ , where  denotes
the equivalent relation: x  x + i for x  g. the quotient lie algebra g/  is a subalgebra of g. it
follows that the d3-brane superalgebra contains various subalgebras:

4.4 d5-branes

the d5-brane is related to the unwrapped d4-brane and the wrapped d6-brane under a t-duality.
the 126 d5-brane charges with ve bosonic charges m1m5, mi = 1, , 9, are obtained from the 70
d4-brane charges z p1p4 and the 56 d6-brane charges z 0p1p2p3, as p1p4 = z p1p4 and p1p5 
z 0p1p2p3, where  denotes the equivalence modulo the self-duality relation. thus, the charges
naturally related to those in the iia superalgebra are not m1m5 but i1i4. under the identication
of the d5-brane charges with the charges in the m-algebra,

d5-brane i1i4  d

i1i4

= i1i4,

(4.8)

where i collectively denotes i and , we nd that the resultant superalgebra is rewritten in a ten-
dimensional covariant form. for example, the mc equation

d d

i1i2i3 = 
4

 a(ai1i2i3)    d
ai1i2i3(a)
 [(i1i2i3])  + 4 [i1i2(i3])

(4.9)

is obtained from the iia d4-brane superalgebra, where hatted forms are dened in (4.1), (4.4) and
(4.8). the corresponding jacobi identity is found to be satised by a (abcd) = (i1  i4) part of the
fierz identity

(e)(abcde)  4([a)(bcd]) = 0,

(4.10)

which is appeared in (2.19) in the ce cohomology classication of iib-branes. it follows from this fact
that the obtained superalgebra can be lifted into a ten-dimensional covariant form. in addition, the
superalgebra can be expressed in terms of so(2) doublets of the supercurrents: d
a1 a4(cid:1)
etc. as a result, we obtain the mc equations for the d5-brane charges (a.1)(a.5) in the appendix
a.

in order to construct the supersymmetric form of the wz term for d5-branes, we need the charges
with ve spinorial indices 15. however, the charges with ve spinorial indices obtained by a t-
duality from the iia superalgebra, or equivalently the m-algebra, turn out to be the iib kk5-brane
charges, as will be seen in sec.4.6. we here introduce the corresponding generators to the algebra for
d5-branes. let us note that under an operation of a dierential d, the degree (p; q, q) of the form of
the d5-brane superalgebra is transformed into a set of the d5-brane charges with degree (4.6). this is
a universal property of our superalgebra: f-string, d-string, d3-brane and d5-brane. the d5-brane
superalgebra supplied with 15 turns out to possess this property too. this property helps us to
construct the mc equations for the charges with ve spinorial indices. we can construct the maurer-
cartan equation (a.6). we nd again that the existence of the d5-brane charges necessarily requires
the existence of the charges of superalgebra generated by supertranslations f-strings, d-strings and
d3-branes. this is consistent with the form of the wz term for d5-branes, or of the seven-form eld
strength h(7) of the six-form rr gauge potential c(6).
the d5-brane superalgebra contains various subalgebras. the descending central series are h0 =
sp [z a, a, abc, a1a5], h1 = {pa, z a, a, abc , a1a5}, h2 = {z, , ab, a1a4}, h3 =
{a, a1a2a3}, h4 = {, a1a2}, h5 = {14a}, h6 = {15}, h7 = {0}. these are
the ideals of our algebra, and h6 is the center of sp [z a, a, abc , a1a5]. the generators a14
are the centers of the subalgebra sp [z a, a, abc , aa1a4], and so on. it follows from this fact that

(4.6), we nd the mc equation (b.6) in the appendix b.

we nd that the existence of the ns5-brane charges in the superalgebra necessarily requires the
presence of the charges of f-strings, d-strings and d3-branes. this is consistent with the form of
the wz term for ns5-branes, or of the seven-form eld strength g(7) of the six-form nsns gauge
potential b(6). the ns5-brane superalgebra contains various subalgebras, which is expressed as (4.11)
with replacing the d5-brane charges a1a5 with the ns5-brane charges z a1a5.

the s-duality was given by a set of transformations of supercurrents (3.21), (3.34) and (3.48). we
can show that under these transformations the ns5-brane superalgebra is mapped to the d5-brane su-
peralgebra, and thus the s-duality is realized as an automorphism of sp [z a, a, abc , z a1a5, a1a5].

the mc equations (c.1)(c.6) for the kk5-brane charges stay invariant. we nd that the exis-
tence of the kk5-brane charges in the algebra necessarily requires the presence of the charges of
d-strings, f-strings, d3-branes, d5-branes and ns5-branes. the descending central series are h0 =
sp [z a, a, abc, a1a5, z a1a5, p i1i5], h1 = {pa, z a, a, abc , a1a5, z a1a5, p i1i5}, h2 =

{, ab, zab, p ij}, h5 = {14a, z14a, p 14i}, h6 = {15, z15, p 15},
h7 = {0}. these are the ideals of our algebra, and h6 is the center of the kk5-brane superalgebra
sp [z a, a, abc, a1a5, z a1a5, p i1i5]. considering quotient algebras, one obtains various sub-
algebras.

in summary, we have obtained the iib-brane superalgebra. the s-duality is realized as an au-
tomorphism of our algebra. the generators of the m-algebra are mapped to those of the iib-brane
superalgebra, except for the d5-brane charge 15 and the ns5-brane charge z15.

5. a description in twelve-dimensions

in the previous section, we obtained the iib-brane superalgebra in presence of all of the f-strings,
d-strings, d3-branes, d5-branes, ns5-branes and kk5-branes. the s-duality is found to be realized
as an automorphism of our superalgebra which was the generalized so(2) r-symmetry. in this section
we show this so(2) symmetry is geometrically realized in twelve-dimensions with signature (11,1).

as the twelve-dimensional -matrices, we dene the real representation of spin(11,1) using ten-

dimensional -matrices as:

a = a  3,

 =   3,

 = 1  1.

(5.1)

the charge conjugation matrix c in twelve-dimensions is related to one in ten-dimensions c as c =
c  3. it follows that

(a1) = (a),
(a1a5 1) = (a1a5),

(a3) = (a),

(a1) = (a),

(abci2) = (abc),

(a1a51) = (a1a5),

(a1a53) = (a1a5).

(5.2)

in (11 + 1)-dimensions, p-branes with p = 1, 2 mod 4 can exist since (1p) is symmetric with
respect to  and  when p = 1, 2 mod 4. writing the p-form charges in twelve-dimensions as z1p,
we nd that the iib-brane charges are expressed in terms of z1p as





a = a,

where the forms with a caret correspond to the dual forms to the charges of the branes in twelve-
dimensions. these charge assignments imply that the iib-branes are related to the branes in twelve-
dimensions in such a way that the s-duality is manifestly realized. the relations are depicted in gure
1.

in fact, we can rewrite the mc equations of the iib-branes as those of the branes in twelve-
dimensions. the mc equations for supertranslations, f-strings and d-strings are found to be rewritten
as (dropping hats)

where m = , . the f- and d-strings are unied as the - and -wrapped 2-branes in twelve-dimensions,
respectively. projecting the majorana spinors in twelve-dimensions to 16+16 majorana-weyl spinors
with the same chirality in ten-dimensions, the above mc equations reduce to those of supertransla-
tions, f-strings and d-strings. the d3-branes are described as the (, )-wrapped 5-branes. the mc
equations are found to be rewritten as

where it is understood that the symmetries of indices on the left hand side are to be implemented
on the right hand side with unit weight (anti) symmetrizations. projecting the majorana spinors
in twelve-dimensions to the majorana-weyl spinors with the same chirality in ten-dimensions, the
above mc equations reduce to those of d3-branes. the iib kk5-brane are expected to be described

22

as the 5-branes in twelve-dimensions. the mc equations (c.1)(c.6) for kk5-branes are rewritten
in such a way that the s-duality is geometrically realized. the mc equation (c.1) is rewritten as
di1i5 =  1
2 (i1i5), which is similar to (5.7). we expect that the mc equations for 5-
branes in twelve-dimensions are composed of (5.7)(5.10) and the mc equations, which is obtained
by lifting the mc equations for kk5-branes into twelve-dimensions.

for ns5- and d5-branes, the corresponding mc equations are found to be rewritten as

the ns5- and d5-branes are unied as the - and -wrapped 6-branes in twelve-dimensions, respec-
tively. in this way, we nd (non-covariant) twelve-dimensional description of the iib-branes.

23

the superalgebra is essentially ten-dimensional.

in order to unify the m-algebra and the iib-
brane superalgebra, one must lift the superalgebra to a superalgebra with the eleven-dimensional
covariance. the relation of the branes in twelve-dimensions to the m-branes are described in gure 1.
the eleven-dimensional supertranslations are described in terms of zm . the 2- and 5-brane charges
zm n and zm1m5 turn out to be the corresponding part of m2- and m5-branes. one nds that in
order to describe the full m-algebra, we must add the charge z to the superalgebra obtained from
the iib superalgebra. we do not give the unied superalgebra here, but we expect that iib-branes
and m-branes will be unied in (11+1)-dimensions.

6. summary and discussions

we have shown that the wz terms of dp- and nsp-branes in the type-iib theory are characterized
by non-trivial chevalley-eilenberg (p + 2)-cocycles. the total actions are equivalent to those obtained
in [19] and -invariant. these wz terms are shown to be constructed in a manifestly supersymmetric
way by introducing a set of new spacetime superalgebras. using these superalgebras, we have shown
that siegels formulation generalizes to the d3-branes, the d5-branes and the ns5-branes. namely,
using the supercurrents on the supergroup manifolds corresponding to the new superalgebras, we
wrote down the wz terms, which are (p + 2)-th order in the supercurrents (p = 5 for the d3-branes
and p = 7 for the d5- and ns5-branes).

the relations of these superalgebras to the m-algebra are discussed. the d5- and ns5-brane su-
peralgebras contain generators with ve spinorial indices, which can not be related to the m-algebra.
in order to construct the manifestly superinvariant wz terms, these charges must be added. we
have established the iib-brane superalgebra with maximal central extension which is generated by
generators: supertranslations qa, d-strings a, f-strings z a, d3-branes abc, d5-branes a1a5,
ns5-branes z a1a5 and kk5-branes p i1i5. the superalgebra enjoys the s-duality, or generalized
so(2) r-symmetry as an automorphism of the algebra. this so(2)-symmetry is found to be geomet-
rically realized in twelve-dimensions with signature (11,1).

we expect that our formulation generalizes to the higher branes: kk5-, d7-, ns7-, d9- and
ns9-branes. the d7- and ns7-brane charges will be contained in abc , and the d9- and ns9-brane
charges in a and z a, respectively. we have presented the iib-brane superalgebra generated by these
generators, but the construction of the corresponding wz terms are left for the future investigations.
we have classied iib ns/dp-branes by ce cohomology (p + 2)-cocycles. it is interesting for us
to consider whether the ce cohomology classication of kk5-branes can be achieved. one wishes to
know the physical meaning of the new generators with spinorial indices. in [18], the corresponding
noether charges are obtained and found to probe the topology of the ordinary superspace. the same
will be true for our models too. in [17], so(2,1)=sl(2,r) covariant iib superalgebra was discovered.
there, translations pa, f-strings z a and d-strings a formed a so(2,1) triplet. it is interesting for us
to construct so(2,1) covariant superalgebra which contains charges of kk5-branes, ns5-branes and
d5-branes as a so(2,1) triplet. if this is achieved, new geometric formulation of (p, q) 5-branes will
be given.

our formulation will be generalized to the case where the target space is curved. for example,
one considers the green-schwarz superstring actions on anti-de sitter spaces: ads3  s3, ads5  s5,
etc. the corresponding coset superspaces are su (1,1|2)lsu (1,1|2)r
for the gs strings on ads3  s3
in order for our formulation to generalize to
and
these cases, the supergroups su (1, 1|2)l  su (1, 1|2)r or su (2, 2|4) must be extended including new

so(4,1)so(5) for the gs strings on ads5  s5.

su (2,2|4)

generators. if this is achieved, the new coordinates corresponding to new generators will be contained
in a surface term. we hope that the physical meaning of the new coordinates will be revealed with
considering these models, and our formulation will shed some light on the various string dualities.
