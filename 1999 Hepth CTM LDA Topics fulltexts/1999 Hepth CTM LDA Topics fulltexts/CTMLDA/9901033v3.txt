abstract

we give arguments in the support of a relation between m-atrix theory and mal-
dacenas conjecture. m-atrix theory conjecture implies the equivalence of 11-d light-
cone supergravity and strongly-coupled (0+1)-d sym. maldacenas sugra/sym
duality conjecture implies, in the one dimensional sym case, the equivalence be-
tween strongly-coupled (0+1)-d sym and 11-d supergravity compactied on a
spatial circle in the formal seiberg-sen limit. using the classical equivalence be-
tween 11-d supergravity on a light-like circle and on a spatial circle in the formal
seiberg-sen limit, we show that in the (0+1)-d sym case, the large-n m-atrix
theory in the supergravity regime is equivalent to sugra/sym duality.

m-atrix theory [1, 2] and maldacenas conjecture [3] are similar in the sense that
both are about the equivalence between m/string theories (i.e. theories in the bulk of
space-time) and brane world-volume theories. but does this similarity go beyond a mere
analogy? maldacenas conjecture relates m/string theory on a curved background to sym
in the at space, whereas m-atrix theory relates m-theory on a transverse torus to sym
on a dual torus.1 for example, consider nite-n m-atrix theory on a 3-torus. if v3 is
the volume of m-theory transverse 3-torus and rthe radius of light-like circle, then the
corresponding d=4 sym is dened on a dual 3-torus of volume v3 = (rm 3
. dual
p v3)1 also blows up in this
3-torus decompacties in the limit v3  0 , but g2
limit. in the large-n limit one has to take r  . we thus have g2
ym  1 and n  1,
and this limit is dierent from the one involved in ads5/cf t4 correspondence.

these formal arguments do not, however, imply that the two conjectures are in conict
with each other, but rather suggest the following possibility. imagine two moduli spaces:
m1 of m-theory and m2 of sym (coordinates of these moduli spaces are: the dimension
d of sym, the rank n of gauge group, the type of gauge theory base space, the type of
space on which m-theory is compactied and so on). one can think of the two conjectures
as two one-to-one maps fmatrix and fmaldacena between certain regions of m1 and m2.
it is clear that if these mappings map two non-overlapping regions in m1 into two non-
overlapping regions in m2, it does not mean that they contradict each other (see figure
1). a natural question to ask is whether the domains of these two mappings intersect,
and if so, are the two mappings identical in the overlap? the motivation for writing this
paper was to answer this question.2

in this paper we will consider (0+1)-d sym case.3 one dimensional sym is simplest
in the sense that no compactication is involved. the purpose of this paper is to establish
a relation between large-n, uncompactied m-atrix theory in the supergravity regime and

1in what follows we will consider m-atrix theory in at backgrounds. m-atrix theory in curved

backgrounds is still very poorly understood [4].

sugra/sym duality (large-n version of maldacenas conjecture) in this one dimensional
case. before we explain this relation, let us review m-atrix theory and sugra/sym
duality conjectures. we give a somewhat detailed review of these conjectures to point out
some important assumptions relevant to our analysis.

the nite-n version of m-atrix theory conjecture [2], as claried by sen and seiberg
[12, 13], states that discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq) of m-theory (with the planck
scale mp and a transverse length scale x) compactied on a light-like circle (x  x +
r is equivalent to m -
2r) in the sector with the total longitudinal momentum p = n
theory (with the planck scale mp and a transverse length scale x) compactied on a
spatial circle (x11  x11 + 2 r) in the sector with the total kaluza-klein momentum
along the x11 direction p11 = n

the large-n version of m-atrix theory conjecture [1] is a related statement about the
uncompactied 11-d light-cone m-theory. it is assumed that the large-n version of m-
atrix theory is the r, n   (with n/r = xed) limit of nite-n theory.

compelling arguments for the validity of nite-n m-atrix theory conjecture were given
by seiberg and sen [13, 12].4 let t be a eld theory (with a mass scale and a set of
dimensionless parameters {yi}) formulated in a at background (or in a background of
the form r1,1  m which has so(1, 1) isometry). let hdlcq
(m, r,{yi}) be the n-
body dlcq quantum mechanical hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the theory t
compactied on a light-like circle (x  x+2r) in the sector with the total longitudinal
momentum p = n
r . the dynamics of the theory t compactied on a small spatial circle
(x  x + 2 r) in the sector with n units of total momentum along the x direction is
also expected to be described by a non-relativistic n-body hamiltonian.5 we denote it
n ( m , r,{yi}). now, thinking of the light-like circle as an almost light-like circle
by hkk
and boosting it, one can show that

the essence of sugra/sym duality is the following: surround a d-brane source in
supergravity by a sphere of radius . supergravity is a low energy limit of string theory
and hence, a priori, it is valid only outside of the sphere. it is claimed that if the curvature
and eective string coupling of the supergravity solution are small, supergravity is valid
also inside of the sphere. it should be noted, however, that this idea does not give a precise
recipe for the sugra/sym correspondence. the rules of the game should be specied
for a particular supergravity background, etc. for example, in the ads/cft case, such
a recipe is given in [15, 16]. in this case, the correspondence is between the uctuations
of supergravity elds around the curved ads background and sym operators. we are
interested in sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality which is discussed in [17]. in the latter paper
it is argued that the motion of a d0-brane probe carrying one unit of rr-charge in the
curved near-horizon geometry of a source d0-brane of charge n  1 is dual to a process
in (0+1)-d sym with the gauge group u(n + 1) broken to u(n)  u(1) by a higgs vev.
motivated by ads/cft correspondence, one may argue that (0+1)-d sym is dual to
supergravity in a curved near-horizon d0-brane background. it seems that this is a widely
accepted point of view. let a be a proponent of this point of view and ba proponent of
the following interpretation (which is our interpretation): sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality
is a relation between the scattering of 11-d supergravity states in a at background and
the corresponding sym processes. the meaning of our interpretation is best illustrated
by the following discussion between a and b.
a: taking maldacenas low energy limit in the d0-brane metric, one obtains the metric of
curved near-horizon geometry of d0-brane. thus, (0+1)-d sym is dual to supergravity on
the curved space. for example, consider the scattering of three d0-branes. let the rst two
of these d0-branes carry one unit of rr-charge each and the third one carries n  1 units
of rr-charge. one can think of the scattering of the rst two d0-branes as taking place in
the curved near-horizon geometry of the third d0-brane. one should, for instance, use the
curved-space propagator to compute scattering amplitudes. this curved-space supergravity

3

picture is dual to (0+1)-d sym with the gauge group u(n + 2)  u(n)  u(1)  u(1).
b: i agree that in the case of u(n + 2)  u(n)  u(1) u(1) your curved-space picture
works. but i have problem with the other cases. suppose that the gauge group u(n) is
broken to u(n1)  u(n2)      u(nk) with ni  n. in this case i can not talk about
scattering as taking place in any background since the back-reaction eects are not negli-
gible.
a: well, i think sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality in this case should be interpreted as a
duality between the excitations of supergravity elds on the multi-center d0-brane static
background and sym processes. in [18] the centers of multi-center static solution were
promoted to dynamical variables. by the way, an analogous point of view, in the context
of ads5/cf t4 correspondence, was rst advocated in maldacenas paper [3].
b: you forgot to mention one important point about ads5/cf t4 correspondence on the
coulomb branch. sym4 has moduli space of supersymmetric vacua which is identical to the
parameter space of the general multi-center d3-brane solution. but we know that (0+1)-d
sym does not have moduli space of vacua because symmetry breaking scalar expectation
values are not frozen variables [19]. therefore, one can not associate the parameter space
of multi-center d0-brane solution with the moduli space of vacua of (0+1)-d sym.
a: but may be instead of associating this parameter space with the moduli space of vacua
(which does not exist in susy quantum mechanics), one should associate it with the space
of slow variables in a born-oppenheimer approximation. it was argued in [19] that born-
oppenheimer approximation is justied in the large-n limit.
b:i have little to say about it. but why dont we adopt the following simple at-space pic-
( r,  ) be n-graviton scattering amplitude in the at 11-d supergravity
ture? let asu gra
compactied on a spatial circle of radius r. let asqm
be a corresponding susy quantum
mechanical amplitude. a simple recipe for the sugra/(0+1)-d sym reads

the curved-space picture is approximately correct and useful in some particular cases like
the case of broken u(n + 2)  u(n)  u(1)  u(1), but the at-space picture is more
general and contains the curved-space picture as a special case. note also that by the at
space picture, i actually mean the procedure of calculating scattering amplitudes in the
supergravity on a at background and taking seiberg-sen limit in the resulting amplitudes.
in the at-space picture context, the curved-space picture emerges eectively in some cases
as a result of taking r  0 limit.
a:did not maldacena use the same arguments in his analysis [3]? namely, he started
with an asympototically at d-brane metric, took a low energy limit   0 in it and
obtained an asymptotically curved metric.
b:the relation eq. (4) is a generalisation of maldacenas idea of taking low energy limit in
the d-brane supergravity solution to the cases when there is no well-dened background in
which scattering takes place. moreover, i am emphasizing atness of supergravity because

4

the justication6 for taking r  0 limit in the supergravity amplitudes involves a classical
equivalence between supergravities on a light-like and a space-like circles, and the latter
equivalence requires the formulation of supergravity in a at background.

we thus see that in the m-atrix theory context (0+1)-d sym in the large-n limit is
equivalent to 11-d light-cone supergravity, and in the context of sugra/sym duality
it is equivalent to 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle in the formal seiberg-sen limit.
assuming that m-atrix theory and sugra/sym duality are related, this suggests that
there should exist a relation between light-cone 11-d supergravity and 11-d supergravity
on a spatial circle in the formal seiberg-sen limit (see figure 2). indeed, it was noticed
in [20, 21] that the scattering potentials calculated in these two supergravities agree. it
is also known that innitely boosting the d0-brane supergravity solution is equivalent to
taking a near-horizon limit (seiberg-sen limit) [20]. the authors of [6, 8] used this fact
to argue that sugra/sym duality and m-atrix theory are equivalent. their arguments
can be summarized as follows, motivated by the nite-n version of m-atrix theory, let
us up-lift the d0-brane sugra metric to 11-d and then compactify it on x. as a
result, we nd that the harmonic function h0 is replaced by h0  1. now rewrite this
metric in terms of new symbols (r, gs, etc.) that are related to the original ones (r, gs,
etc.) by seiberg-sens relations eq. (1). now, let us appropriately rescale (using seiberg-
sens relations) the resulting metric written in terms of new symbols. we nd that this
rescaled metric is precisely that of the d0-brane in the the near-horizon limit! so, we
see the validity of seiberg-sens prescription when applied to the background geometry of
supergravity associated with the dlcq of m-theory. we also see that (0+1)-d sym
is equivalent to uctuations7 of sugra elds around the curved near-horizon d0-brane
background. since we know that the latter statement is precisely that of sugra/sym
duality, we seem to have shown that sugra/sym duality follows from m-atrix theory.

there are several objections against their line of reasoning. first, the meaning of
taking seiberg-sen limit in the expression for the metric is not clear. in seiberg-sens
derivation of m-atrix theory, this limit was taken in the full m-theory and not just in
supergravity. second, the discussion of the authors of [6, 8] seems to imply that two
m-theories formulated in the curved backgrounds are related via seibergs boost, but the
backgrounds they considered do not have so(1,1) isometry. but is not it the case that
in the seiberg-sens derivation of matrix theory one breaks lorentz invariance by com-
pactication on a circle? it is so, but the underlying theory is supposed to be an so(1,1)
invariant theory formulated in a background of the form r1,1  m. the backgrounds
considered by [6, 8] are not so(1,1) isometric before the compactication.

we resolve the rst problem by clarifying the meaning of taking seiberg-sen limit
in supergravity expressions. its meaning is the classical equivalence of 11-d supergrav-
ities on light-like and spatial circles. the second problem is resolved by interpreting

6the discussion of this justication will be given below.
7we think these authors implicitly assumed this when they talked about the background geometry

etc.

sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality in a way dierent from what they did. we stated ear-
lier our interpretation of this duality in one-dimensional case:
...a relation between the
scattering of supergravity states in a at background and the corresponding sym processes.

in order to show that m-atrix theory and sugra/sym duality are related one has
to use the rectangle of relations (see figure 2) and the classical equivalence of two
supergravities. let us prove the classical equivalence of two supergravities. let us denote
n ( m , r,{yi}) classical hamiltonians of a theory compactied
by h l.c.
on light-like and spatial circles in the sectors with n units of longitudinal momentum. in
the hamiltonian formulation we associate them with the vector elds (/x+) and (/t).
the analog of eq. (2) in this classical case reads

n (m, r,{yi}) and h s.l.

h l.c.
n (m, r,{yi}) = lim

(5)

note that the statements expressed by eq. (2) and eq. (5) are very dierent. the latter
states the equivalence of two classical eld theory hamiltonians and the former states the
equivalence of two quantum mechanical n-body hamiltonians. it is the exploitation of
this dierence that enables us to relate the two conjectures. applying eq. (5) to 11-d
supergravity formulated in a at background, one establishes the classical equivalence
between the two supergravities.

it should be noted that our analysis is dierent from that of [5]. the arguments of the
[5] goes as follows. from the expression for the 11d supergravity plane
authors of ref.
wavesolution ds2 = dx+dx + (q/r7)(dx)2 + dx2
i , one sees that x, the putative compact
it thus seems that the gravitational
null direction, is in fact spacelike for r < .
eects automatically provide with the almost light-likeness of the circle which is crucial in
seibergs derivation of matrix theory. it is the reason why supergravity solution is valid
at short distances. as we understand, the discussion of [10] seems to imply that the
dlcq quantization of m-theory in such a shock-wave background can not yield a theory
of pure d0-branes (an ordinary matrix susy quantum mechanics) because the circle is
only asymptotically null and negative momentum modes do not decouple. in our analysis
the validity of supergravity solution at short distances follows from the matrix theory
conjecture and the classical equivalence of light-cone and spacelike supergravities, and
therefore, our analysis is dierent from that of [5].

let us give some examples [20, 21] which illustrate eq. (5). the potential for graviton-
graviton scattering with no longitudinal momentum transfer in 11-d supergravity com-
pactied on a light-like circle reads [20]

which follow from eq. (1), it is easy to show that hl.c. = lim r0 hs.l..

separated by a distance r reads [21]

it is easier

to obtain it directly from 11-d supergravity, starting with the membrane probe action s = r ldt =

l( x11(p11))  x11p11 .

it would be interesting to extend these scattering potential calculations to the cases in-
volving longitudinal momentum exchange, recoil eects, etc. in view of relation eq. (5),
one expects agreement in these cases. note that the equivalence between two supergrav-
ities holds for arbitrary n, but in relating m-atrix theory and sugra/sym duality we
use only the equivalence for large n.9

let us conclude by summarizing our arguments. m-atrix theory conjecture implies the
equivalence of strongly coupled one dimensional sym and 11-d light-cone supergravity.
on the other hand, sugra/sym duality implies the equivalence of one dimensional
sym and 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle in sen-seibergs limit. we proved that the
hamiltonian of 11-d supergravity on a light-like circle is equal to a limit of the hamiltonian
of 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle. in this way, we have shown that large-n, low
energy version of m-atrix theory and sugra/sym duality are equivalent in the one
dimensional sym case.
