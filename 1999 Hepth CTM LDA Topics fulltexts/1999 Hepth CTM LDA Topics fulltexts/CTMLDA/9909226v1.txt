abstract

we consider monopole and dyon classical solutions of the yang-mills-higgs sys-
tem coupled to gravity in asymptotically anti-de sitter space. we discuss both
singular and regular solutions to the second order equations of motion showing
that singular wu-yang like dyons can be found, the resulting metric being of the
reissner-nordstrom type (with cosmological constant). concerning regular solu-
tions, we analyze the conditions under which they can be constructed discussing,
for vanishing coupling constant, the main distinctive features related to the anti-de
sitter asymptotic condition; in particular, we nd in this case that the v.e.v. of the
higgs scalar, | ~h()|, should be quantized in units of the natural mass scale 1/e r0
(related to the cosmological constant) according to | ~h()|2 = m(m + 1)(e r0)2,
with m  z.

1 introduction

soon after the discovery of the magnetic monopole and dyon solutions [1]-[4] in spon-
taneously broken su(2) gauge theory with higgs elds in the adjoint representation,
dierent kinds of self-gravitating monopoles were discussed [5]-[7]. subsequently, the
gravitational properties of these solutions and the relation between monopoles and black
holes were thoroughfully investigated [8]-[11]; more recenlty, numerical studies clarifying
gravitational instabilities and other peculiar features of the solutions have been presented
[12]-[14] (see [15]-[16] for a more complete list of references). all these investigations
correspond to asymptotically at spaces. less is known when space time is modied to
include a cosmological constant , in particular for  < 0, i.e. the case in which space

is asymptotically anti-de sitter space. recently, black hole solutions [17] and soliton so-
lutions [18] have been found in this case for the einstein-yang-mills system (no higgs
eld).

it is the purpose of this work to study monopole and dyon solutions for yang-mills-

higgs theory coupled to gravity in asymptotically anti-de sitter (ads) space.

in section 2 we present the model, the spherically symmetric ansatz for the gauge
eld, the higgs triplet and the metric, leading to radial equations of motion. then, in
section 3 we present a dyonic ads black hole solution (analogous to the one constructed
in [5]-[6] in asymptotically at space). following dierent perturbative approaches, we
analyse in section 4 regular monopole solutions and discuss its main properties. finally,
we summarize our results in section 5.

2 the model, the ansatz and the equations of motion

we adopt the conventions in [19]-[20] for metric curvature, gauge elds and else

f  da + a  a

(2.1)

where a is a one-form connection.

a higgs eld (h i) transforms in the representation r of the semisimple gauge group
g which has lie algebra g generated by xa with commutation relations and metric (that
rises and lows indices)

[xa, xb] = f c

ab xc

ab  < xa, xb >

d stands for general covariant derivative and gij is a gauge invariant metric.

the action we consider is given by

s = sg + sy m + sh = z ddxq|g|(lg + ly m + lh )

where v (h) is the higgs potential, 0  8gd with gd is the newton constant in d
dimensions (to be taken as d = 4 in what follows), e the gauge coupling and  is the
cosmological constant (one easily sees that with our conventions  < 0 corresponds, in
the absence of matter, to anti-de sitter space).

the equations of motion that follow from (2.3) are

let us take now for deniteness g = su(2), gij = ij for the higgs elds in the adjoint

the most general static spherically symmetric form for the metric in 3 spatial dimensions
togheter with the thooft-polyakov-julia-zee ansatz for the gauge and higgs elds in the
usual vector notation reads

ab = abc with < xa, xb > 1

~a = dt e h0 j(x) er  d (1  k(x)) e + d (1  k(x)) sin  e

where we identify the constant h0 (assumed non zero) with the minimum of the potential

v (h) =

the boundary conditions

ansatz (2.6) will lead to well behaved solutions for the matter elds if, at x = 0, one
imposes

 h(x)/x and j(x)/x are regular;
 1  k(x) and k (x) go to zero.
on the other hand we want the system to go asymptotically to anti-de sitter space
which corresponds to the solution of the einstein equations with  < 0 in absence of
matter (see next section); for this to happen we must impose that the matter energy-
momentum tensor vanishes at spatial innity. from eq.(2.5) one can see that the appro-
priate conditions for x   are

k(x)  o(x1)
h(x)  h + o(x12)
j(x)  j + o(x3)

(2.12)

with i > 0, i = 1, 2, 3.

3 a dyonic ads black hole in four dimensions

before discussing regular solutions to equations of motion (2.9) satisfying the boundary
conditions specied above, let us discuss a singular solution which has very interesting
properties. indeed, one can easily see that the restriction

k(x) = 0
h(x) = 1

(3.1)

leads to a singular solution that exhibits a dirac string starting at x = 0 and so the
abelian dirac monopole character of this solution, related to a wu-yang-like dyon [21]
which, for asymptotically at space was considered long ago [5]-[6]. the equations for the
metric are trivially solved by (3.1)

a(x) = 1
(x) = 1 + 0 x2

(3.2)

leading to a metric of the reissner-nordstrom type (with cosmological constant). the
constant a in (3.2) is related to the mass of this ads charged black hole.

we then see that the parameter b determines the electric charge while j sets the scale
for j. in fact, the metric function (x) (eq. (3.2)) can be rewritten in the form

making explicit the role of the (unit) magnetic and electric charges, the same as in the
 = 0 case [12]. at the radii for which the metric function vanishes, there will be in
general event horizons, as it happens in asymptotically at space. now, the condition
(x) = 0 leads here to a quartic algebraic equation for x,

where we have dened

the explicit expression for the roots of this equation is not very illuminating. one can
see that for 0  a2 (or ||  (1/a2)e2h2
0) the horizons have, qualitatively, the same
behavior as in the asymptotically at case: there is a critical value z 2
crit for z 2 such that
there are two horizons for z 2 < z 2
crit.
the value of z 2
crit and the two horizons can be determined as a power expansion in a20
[22]. let us end this section by noting that, although the gauge eld is singular at the
origin, the solution can be considered regular as a black hole, so that the singularity could
be hidden behind a horizon.

space. concerning the integration constant a, it is related to the mass of the black hole
and will be put to zero in what follows. this metric, in turn, acts as a (ads) background
with radius r0,

r0 = q3/

(4.2)

for the yang-mills-higgs system.

for simplicity we start studying eqs (2.9) in the bps limit which corresponds to

the total amount of matter m can be associated with the generator of traslations in

m = zt

where g(3)

it is not dicult to see from these expression that the boundary conditions imposed
through eqs.(2.12) are precisely those required for niteness of m.

attempts towards a perturbative solution

in at minkowski space eqs.(4.3) become bps equations with the well-honoured prasad-
sommereld solution saturating the bogomolnyi bound [4]

k0(x) =
h0(x) = cosh  f (x)

where the constant  denes the boundary condition at innity and

j0(x) = sinh  f (x)

(4.7)

(4.8)

for asymptotically at space-times one can prove that self-gravitating monopoles satu-
rating the bogomolnyi bound do not exist [15]. in contrast, solutions to the second order
equations of motion can be found numerically, starting from the at space solution (4.7)
and taking 0 suciently small. this regular monopole (or dyon) solution ceases to exist
for some critical value 0 = c

0 [10]-[14].

one should expect that something similar happens in ads space, at least for small
enough 0 (we are already in the 0h2
0  0 limit): the existence of a small cosmological
constant (with respect to the higgs mass) should alter a little the prasad-sommerfeld
solution leading to a dyonic regular solution of the second order equations of motion in
ads space. to analyse this possibility one can try a perturbative solution around the
prasad-sommereld solution in the form

k(x) = k0(x) + xm1
h(x) = h0(x) + xm1
j(x) = j0(x) + xm1

(4.9)

inserting these expansions in equations (4.3) and comparing 0 powers, one gets a recursive
set of inhomogeneous linear second order dierential equations which can be written as

at each order m, eqs.(4.10) corresponds to a coupled linear system of three dierential

integrated with the result

which is well behaved in x = 0 but grows linearly with x at innity! this could be taken
as a signal that a solution of the type proposed in (4.9) does not exist, indicating that
the theory with cosmological constant strictly zero has a completely dierent behavior
from that with  6= 0, regardless how small  could be. another indication in the same
direction comes from the comparison of the ads boundary conditions (2.12) with those
corresponding to the at space case,

k(x)  o(x1)
h(x)  h + o(x2)
j(x)  j + o(x3)

x  1

(4.19)

comparing these at space conditions with those corresponding to ads space (conditions
(2.12)) we see that the latter require the higgs eld to reach its vacuum expectation value
faster than in at space. it is seemingly that the unbounded behaviour of (x)  1 for
0 6= 0 (eq.(4.1)) is at the root of this situation. it is worth to note at this point that
2 6= 0 ) the vanishing of the higgs potential at innity
away from the bps limit ( /g0
requires exactly the same boundary both in ads and in at space.

re-statement of the problem and asymptotic expansions

a hint about the possible non regular behaviour of the solution in terms of the parameter
0 comes from the following analysis.

if and only if 0 is dierent from zero and positive (e.g. in the case of ads space) one

can introduce the following functions

k(y)  q(x) k(x)|x= y
h(y)  x q(x) h(x)|x= y
j(y)  x j(x)|x= y

0

0

0

in term of which the equations of motion take the form

y2 (1 + y2)2 k(y) = k(y) (cid:16)k(y)2 + h(y)2  j(y)2  1(cid:17)
y2 (1 + y2)2 h(y) = 2 h(y) (cid:18)k(y)2 + y2 (y2 +

)(cid:19)

3
2

y2 (1 + y2)2 j(y) = 2 j(y) k(y)2

(4.20)

(4.21)

the dependence on 0 has completely disappeared from (4.21) through the non analytical
change (4.20)

note the monopole mass can be written as

m =

4 h0

e

f (0, 0) =

4 
e2 r0

f0

(4.22)

where, extending the usual at space notation [1] we have introduced the dimensionless
function f = f (/e2, 0) and which in the prasad-sommereld limit can be written as

9

f (0, 0) = 0f0 with f0 a numerical constant which can be in principle calculated and
is of course nite if the appropriate boundary conditions hold. thus, having ads space
a natural scale r0, the system trades (in the prasad-sommereld limit) h0 for the ads

radius r0 = q3/ which now sets the scale for the mass.
returning to eqs.(4.21), one should note that in the y << 1 region, which in the
original variable corresponds to x << 1/0 , one could hope to nd the bps solution
since 0 is eectively very small and the domain is approximately at; in fact it is easy
to check that the system reduces in this region to the bps equations. therefore, the
problem can be settled as follows: a nite mass monopole (or dyon) in ads space should
interpolate between the bps solution near y = 0,

k(y) = k0(y)
h(y) = y h0(y)
j(y) = y j0(y)

and a solution that asymptotically behaves as

k(y)  o(y11)
h(y)  h y2 + o(y12)
j(y)  j y + o(y13)

(4.23)

(4.24)

in the intermediate (y  1) region (4.21) corresponds to a constant coecient system, this
ensuring the existence of a solution in the neighborhood, according to standard theorems
on non-linear dierential equations systems.

the pure magnetic monopole.

let us still simplify the problem by considering neutral (j = 0) magnetic monopoles. we
try at large distances a power series solution of the form

k(y) =



xn=1

kn yn ,

h(y) = h y2 +

y  1
hn yn ,

y  1

(4.25)



xn=0

plugging these expansions into eqs.(4.21) one gets a compatible set of recursion relations.
it is worth to note that this procedure does not work in at space:
in order system to
close, it should neccessary to add also positive powers, because of the exponential decay
behaviour of the solution (4.7). this signals a very dierent qualitative behaviour of the
solution in ads with respect to at space, its origin being of course the quadratically
divergent behaviour of (x) in ads space, which produces a power six (instead of two) in
the r.h.s. of (4.21).

coming back to the expansions, one gets for for kn the recursive relations

the situation changes for n > 5).

with a a free parameter. the analysis of the system (4.26) shows up a remarkable feature.
one easily veries that, unless

h

2 = m (m + 1)

, m = 1, 2, .....

(4.28)

one has k(y)  0 .
while h(y) is just the solution of the linear equation

now, when k(y) = 0 the gauge eld corresponds to a dirac monopole conguration

h(y) =

3 + 2 y2
(1 + y2)2 h(y)

given by

h = yq1 + y2

which corresponds to h(y) = 1. this shows that this solution coincides with that dis-
cussed in section 3. (there is a second solution for h which has to be discarded since it
is not regular at the origin).

more interesting are the solutions for which h is quantized according to (4.28), which

implies that the higgs eld takes at innity the value (see eq.(2.6))

now, in the prasad-sommereld at space case, being the higgs potential absent, h0 is
introduced both in order to set a scale and as a vestige of the vanishing potential. this is
achieved precisely through the asymptotic condition (4.32) which is not imposed by the
potential (as in the  6= 0 case) but nevertheless results to be a consistent asymptotic
condition for monopoles without electric charge. with a similar purpose we introduced
h0 in curved space as a scale, nding that the consistent asymptotic value of the higgs
scalar is constrained by the ads geometry to obey (4.31) instead of (4.32). moreover the
natural scale for the higgs v.e.v. is set by the cosmological constant. the fact that the
asymptotic conditions change in ads space is already encountered for the simple case of
a free massive eld where one nds that the scalar cannot approach a constant at innity
[23]. in the present case, where the scalar is coupled to a gauge eld, the higgs scalar has
to behave at innity according to (4.31) and even the lowest possible non-trivial value for
m, m = 1, gives in anti-de sitter space a squared higgs eld v.e.v. which is twice the at
space value measure in the natural units of each problem. in some sense this behavior
resembles, for the purely magnetic solution in ads space, to the consistent asymptotic
condition for at space prasad-sommereld dyons which is not h0 but h0 cosh  [4].

a rst analysis of eqs.(4.26) indicates that a non trivial monopole solution should exist
in asymptotically anti-de sitter space. indeed, k(y) can be written at large distances, in
the form

(4.33)

k(y) =

km

ym  1 

am

y2 + o(1/y3)!

where am and the higher order terms can be straighforwardly computed from (4.26):
a1 = 1/5, a2 = 3/7, a3 = 2/3, . . . . we see that k(y) exhibits an ym behavior. the
corresponding coecient as well as a are free parameters which should be in principle
determined by matching this behavior with the solution for small y.

concerning the case in which an electric eld is included, direct inspection of the third

equation in (4.21) reveals that an ansatz of the form

j(y) = j y  b +

j5
y5 + ...

(4.34)

together with the ansatz (4.25) for k(y) and h(y) should work as well. (the high 1/y
power is dictated by the necessity of cancelling the (x) factor)

5 discussion

we have discussed in this work monopole and dyon congurations for yang-mills-higgs
theory coupled to gravity when a cosmological constant is included so that space-time is,
asymptotically, anti-de sitter space. making the usual spherically symmetric ansatz to
separate the equations of motion, we have investigated both singular and regular cong-
urations carrying magnetic and electric charge.

concerning singular solutions, we have constructed a wu-yang like dyon solution with
a metric of the reissner-nordstrom type (with cosmological constant). the event horizons

12

can be determined as a power expansion in a20, with a related to the mass of the black
hole and 0 proportional to the cosmological constant. although the gauge eld is singular
at the origin, the solution can be considered regular as a black hole, with the singularity
hidden behind the horizon.

in order to nd regular solutions to the coupled equations of motion, we have inves-
tigated dierent regimes. with vanishing gravitational constant, einstein equations de-
couple from matter and the solution for the metric corresponds to a neutral schwarzchild
black hole in ads. this metric acts as a background for the yang-mills-higgs system, this
changing radically the properties of the solution with respect to the asymptotically at
space case.

first, we have tried to nd solutions to the second order equations of motion, close to
the bps ones, which have been shown to exist in the small newton constant regime for
asymptotically at space. now, when a cosmological constant is included (no matter how
small this constant is) no solution close to the bps conguration can be found. as we
showed, it is the change in the asymptotic behavior of the higgs eld due to a non zero
cosmological constant that prevents such a solution.

we have then studied the problem of matching the conditions that the solutions have to
satisfy in asymptotically ads space with those required at the origin, in order to have nite
mass. working for simplicity in the prasad-sommereld limit, we have found a remarkable
result: the v.e.v. | ~h()| of the higgs scalar should obey | ~h()|2 = m(m+1)(e r0)2 with
m = 1, 2, . . . (note that this result is obtained when an asymptotic power series behaviour
is assumed). when this condition is fullled, our analysis shows that a monopole solution
can be constructed with a nite mass whose scale is set by the ads radius. we leave the
numerical analysis of such monopole and dyon solution for a forthcoming work.
