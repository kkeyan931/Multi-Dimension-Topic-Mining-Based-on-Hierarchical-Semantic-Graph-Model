abstract

open systems acquire time-dependent coupling constants through interaction with
an external eld or environment. we generalize the lewis-riesenfeld invariant theorem
to open system of quantum elds after second quantization. the generalized invariants
and thereby the quantum evolution are found explicitly for time-dependent quadratic
fermionic systems. the pair production of fermions is computed and other physical
implications are discussed.

the dynamical evolution of the universe in time has to be examined carefully to understand
the phase transitions that are crucial to the cosmological scenarios. the phase transition may
be aecting topologically unstable structures in the universe and these may have important
consequences for the inationary universe. the observational aspects like baryon asymmetry
may require the presence of time-dependent gauge elds. the time evolution of the universe
would require that both scalar and fermionic elds are time dependent through their interactions
with the gravity. furthermore one may need to calculate the pair production of fermions due to
the oscillating inatons. this may provide a possible mechanism for preheating mechanism for
fermionic systems.

all these time-dependent processes in the universe would be happening when the system is not
in equilibrium and there is no xed temperature. we have a system that is time-dependent and in
a non-equilibrium state. similar time-dependent and rapidly varying processes in the laboratory,
that simulate the conditions at the early evolutionary stage of the universe, relate to the heavy
ion reactions at the relativistic heavy ion facility at brookhaven. it is intended that in colliding
heavy ion (u on u) reactions there will be a deconning phase transition from nucleonic to a
quark-gluon system that exists for a very brief period of time before making a phase transition
back to the baryonic matter. the time evolution of the formation and dissolution of the quark-
gluon plasma is a highly non-equilibrium process that requires a careful consideration of the time
dependence of the coupling of both the fermionic and bosonic systems.

the coupling constants or parameters of a system depend on time implicitly through the
interaction when it interacts with an environment. any system whose coupling constants or
parameters depend on time explicitly can be regarded as a subsystem of a larger closed system
and belongs to an open system. to describe properly the quantum states of such open system one
may nd the evolution of the system plus environment and integrate out the degrees of freedom
corresponding to the environment. or one may rely on eld theoretical methods such as closed
time path integral (for review and references, see [1]) or thermo eld dynamics (for review and
references, see [2]).

even though the thermo eld dynamics is a real time operator formalism it has not been
applied to a real problem to investigate the time evolution. hence we choose instead to use the
functional schrodinger picture approach [3-5]. it is conceivable that this may provide some help
in using the thermo eld dynamics. even the quantum evolution of a time-dependent system has
also been an outstanding problem in quantum mechanics. a frequently used method is to nd
trial wave functions (a variational approach) with undetermined time-dependent coecients and
to x these coecients by solving the schrodinger equation. lewis and riesenfeld introduced a
systematic method to nd the operators that satisfy the quantum liouville-von neumann equation
and to solve for the exact quantum states as their eigenstates [6]. this method has been applied
successfully to some of the time-dependent systems, in particular, the harmonic oscillator systems.

the lewis-riesenfeld invariant theorem has been applied successfully to study the quantum
evolution of scalar elds in an expanding friedman-robertson-walker universe [7-12]. a variety
of results were obtained including the vacuum state and the wightman functions with respect to
the vacuum, thermal equilibrium and coherent states. however, as suggested above the overall

2

evolution of the universe would require not only the time dependence of the scalar eld but also
that of a fermion eld. since the fermion eld is a four component spinor, it appears natural to
use the lewis-riesenfeld invariant theorem to the fermion eld taking proper account of the fact
that the spinor components lead to a set of coupled equations. the usual procedure of writing the
spinor eld in terms of creation and annihilation operators is adopted. the results of quantum
evolution of the fermion eld are presented. we give a brief overview of the application to the
scalar eld and then a detailed account of the method as applied to the fermion system is given.

the open system of the quantum eld is described by the functional schrodinger equation

where  represents a scalar or fermion eld. our stratagem is to express the hamiltonian in the
second quantization as a sum of innite number of nite dimensional quantum systems, which
are decoupled or coupled depending on the type of interactions. and then we apply the lewis-
riesenfeld theorem to each nite dimensional system and nd the generalized invariants and
thereby the evolution of the second quantized hamiltonian.

according to the lewis-riesenfeld invariant theorem, the hermitian invariant operator o(t),

satisfying the liouville-von neumann equation for a time-dependent hamiltonian h(t)

o(t) + [ o(t), h(t)] = 0,
has time-dependent eigenstates and time-independent eigenvalues

is given by a superposition of states |n, ti, up to time-dependent phase factors.

(4)

the theorem was originally proved by lewis and riesenfeld and applied to a time-dependent
harmonic oscillator [6]. we now give a simple proof of the theorem. we assume that o(t) be a
hermitian operator and act on the hilbert space for the system h(t). when the states are not
normalizable, the hilbert space should be extended to a rigged one [13]. the operator may have
a possible degeneracy

where the index a runs over the degenerate eigenstates. one can apply eq. (2) to the eigenstate
|a
n, ti and dierentiate eq. (3) to obtain the following identity

n



(cid:16)i

t  h(t)(cid:17)|a
n, ti (cid:16) o(t)  n i(cid:17)h(cid:16)i
where i denotes the identity operator. by acting ha
n, t| on eq. (6) and using the fact that o(t) is
n, t| belongs to the kernel of the hermitian operator o(t) n i, one

and eq. (6) reduces to

t = 0, that is, the eigenvalue is a constant. hence the rst term of eq. (6) vanishes

n, ti = xb

assuming the orthonormal basis ha
the both sides:

n, ti = mnab, ba
t  h(t)(cid:17)|a
n, t|(cid:16)i
since o(t)  n i is a hermitian operator and ab

is an exact solution of eq. (4). the most general state is a superposition of states like the ones
given by eq. (13).

it should be pointed out that the lewis-riesenfeld theorem can also be applied to innite-
dimensional quantum systems such as the quantum elds when they are expressed as a sum
of nite dimensional systems. the second quantized hamiltonian of quantum elds has such
a form. another important observation is that the theorem can also be applied to bosonic or
fermionic systems when the commutators or anticommutators are appropriately used for boson
and fermion operators, respectively. we shall consider a scalar eld with a time-dependent mass
and a time-dependent fermion system with the most general quadratic form as open systems.

a massive scalar eld with a time-dependent mass described by the lagrangian density

has the second quantized hamiltonian in the standard basis of the minkowski spacetime

dene the fock space for each mode. the exact quantum states for each mode are linear super-
position of these number states as given by eq. (13), and the wave function for the scalar eld is
the product of these quantum states.

we now generalize the quadratic form of eq.

and all the other anticommutators vanish. so the hamiltonian given by eq. (20) describes a
system bilinear in the fermion elds. the unitarity of quantum evolution requires the hermiticity

by eliminating either u(t) or v(t) in eq. (32) we obtain the second order dierential equations.

the consistency of anticommutators for all times is guaranteed by

t(cid:16)u (d)(t)u (d)(t) + v (d)(t)v (b)(t)(cid:17) = 0,



where m 

u(t) = mv(t) is used. the other anticommutators

{ b(t), b(t)} = { b
{ d(t), d(t)} = { d

where 3m t

since the b(t), b

(45)

one-particle state is constructed by applying the operator b
(t) to the zero-particle state (eq.
(39)). the number states of the antiparticle can be similarly constructed by using the number
operator n (d)
 (t). these states in general depend on time, but their eigenvalues (occupation
numbers) do not depend on time as expected according to the lewis-riesenfeld theorem. the
vacuum state is the one that is annihilated by all the annihilation operators b(t) and d(t):

b(t)|0, 0, ti = d(t)|0, 0, ti = 0.

(46)

when the interaction is turned on for a nite period of time or the system evolves from an
asymptotic region where all the  are constants and eq.
(46) coincides with the minkowski
vacuum, the pair production of fermions from the initial vacuum is given by

a few comments are in order. the generalized invariants in eq. (35) for the hamiltonian
given by eq. (25) are more general than those for eq. (48), since b(t) involves only b and
d
 and d(t) involve only b
d, then eq.
(35) is the unique choice compatible with the algebra. furthermore, eq. (47), when restricted to
eq. (48) gives the same result for the pair production as other quantum eld theories. one may
also extend the analysis to the fermion interacting with an electromagnetic eld by introducing a
hamiltonian that is similar in form to eq. (25) but involves dirac matrices  in a coupling with
the time dependent coecient (t).

one of the important issues not treated in this paper is the non-equilibrium aspect of open
system of quantum elds. this can be done by introducing a density operator of the form
(t) = e( n (b)
 (t)), which satises the liouville-von neumann equation by its construction,
which will be addressed in a future publication. one of the applications of the result of this paper is
the evolution of fermions in an expanding universe, where fermions gain time-dependence through
the interaction with the gravity. the other is to calculate the pair production rate of fermions
due to the oscillating inaton and to provide a preheating mechanism for the fermionic system.
finally the time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma in a relativistic heavy ion collision would
simulate the conditions present at the early moments of the universe and would thus provide us
with an experimental view of the evolution of the universe.

after the submission of this paper we were informed of ref.

[15], where linear invariants
have also been introduced for fermionic systems. however, we have explicitly shown the auxiliary
equations for invariants, proved the consistency of the method and constructed the hilbert space
of particle and antiparticle states for general fermionic systems.
