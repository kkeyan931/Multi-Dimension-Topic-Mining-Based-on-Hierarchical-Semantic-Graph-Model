in a recent comment [1] park and yee claimed that derivation of the statistical entropy
[2] is plagued by an error. in
of 2d (two-dimensional) black holes proposed by us in ref.
this reply comment we show that the arguments used by park and yee in ref. [1] against
our derivation do not apply to our case. before going into the details of the confutation of
the claim of ref. [1], let us briey explain the arguments of park and yee.

in our attempt to calculate the statistical entropy of the 2d anti-de sitter (ads) black
hole along the lines of ref.
[3] we found a major diculty: owing to the dimension of the
boundary, the charges j[] (eq. (18) of ref. [2]) do not support a realization of the virasoro
algebra (the asymptotic symmetries of 2d ads space). this problem is not a peculiarity of
the 2d case but shows up also in higher dimensions [4]. to solve the problem we proposed
to dene the new, time-integrated, generators j[] (eq. (22) of ref. [2]). moreover, we were
able to show that the dirac bracket algebra of the charges j[] gives a central extension of
the virasoro algebra and to calculate its central charge. to compute the central charge of
the algebra we used the equation:

dj[] = j[[, ]] + c(, ),

(1)

where the hat has the meaning of an overall time-integration. park and yee claim that the
left-hand side of eq. (1) can not be written as

{ j[], j []}db,

(2)
thus invalidating our result that the charges j span a representation of the virasoro algebra.
the demonstration of park and yee relies on the two assumptions that need to be gener-
alized if one wants to interpret consistently the time-integrated charges j as generators of a
algebra. first, the generators of the asymptotic symmetry can no longer be identied with
the phase space functionals h[] ( eq. (17) of ref. [2]), but rather with the time-integrated
ones h[]. second, the usual denition of the poisson brackets, as brackets evaluated at
equal times, has to be generalized in order to allow for general brackets

{ h[], h[]}p b,

(3)
where h[] is a time-integrated functional. this generalization of objects of the canonical
formalism is implicitly contained in the denition of the charges j[] [5]. moreover this is
what is needed in order to recognize eq. (1) as a canonical realization of the asymptotic
symmetries. we do not know if in this framework the charges j[] have a sensible interpre-
tation as noether charges. this is irrelevant for our purposes since we are just looking for a
canonical realization of the asymptotic symmetries that allows us to perform a computation
of the central charge of the algebra.

using the previously dened generalized notions of canonical generators and poisson
brackets we can easily prove that the left-hand side of eq. (1) can be written as a dirac
bracket algebra. one just needs to compute explicitly the brackets { h[], h[]}p b. one
nds [5]:

{ h[], h[]} = h[[, ]] + c(, )

where the central charge has exactly the same value found in ref.
[2]. fixing the gauge
so that the constraints hold strongly and using eq. (17) of ref. [2], the previous equation
implies

{ j[], j[]}db = j[[, ]] + c(, ).

comparing this equation with eq. (1), it follows immediately that the left-hand side of the
latter can be written as the dirac bracket in eq. (2).

let us now show explicitly that the calculations used in ref.

[1] by park and yee to
support their claim are inconsistent with our denitions of generators and poisson brackets.
from equation (4) it follows immediately that the canonical generators of the virasoro
algebra are the functionals h[] rather then h[]. therefore eq. (6) of ref.
[1], which is
the starting point of the demonstration of park and yee, does not apply. the right equation
to be used here is instead:

{j[], h[]}db = {j[], j[]}db = j[].

(6)

following yee and park we perform now the time integration of eq. (6). the left-hand

side becomes



2 z 2

0



dt{j[(t)], j[]}db = { j[], j[]}db,

(7)

from which it follows immediately that the left-hand side of eq. (1) can be written as a
dirac bracket.
