a static minimal energy conguration of a super p-brane in a supersymmetric (n+1)-dimensional
spacetime is shown to be a generalized calibrated submanifold. calibrations in e(1,n) and adsn+1
are special cases. we present several m-brane examples.

i. introduction

where  is a constant real spinor normalized so that

a super p-brane [13] is a charged p-dimensional ob-
ject moving in superspace, with a charge equal to its
tension, which we set to unity.
if the superspace is a
supersymmetric one then the (n+1)-dimensional space-
time will admit a timelike killing vector eld k and the
motion will conserve a corresponding energy e. the fact
that the p-brane is charged means that it couples to a
superspace (p+1)-form potential a. there are therefore
two contributions to the energy density of a static brane,
one proportional to the p-volume density, the other an
electrostatic energy density. the p-volume density is
det m where m is the induced worldspace p-metric. the
electrostatic energy density is the worldspace dual of the
p-form induced by ika; let us call this . thus, as we
shall conrm below, stable static bosonic solutions to the
worldvolume eld equations (the branewave equations)
minimize a potential energy functional of the form

e = z dphdet m + i ,

t  = 1 ,

(3)

and m1...mk are antisymmetrized products of
the
minkowski spacetime dirac matrices. many calibrations
of this form have been shown [6] to calibrate super-
symmetric intersecting brane congurations in m-theory
(for which  is a real 32-component spinor of the 11-
dimensional lorentz group). similar calibrations were
earlier discussed in the context of calabi-yau compacti-
cations of string theory [7]. the essential point is that,
given a tangent p-plane , we can write | as

| = det m t 

(4)

where  is the matrix

 =

1

p!det m

i1...ipi1 xi1  ip xip 0i1...ip ,

(5)

(1)

evaluated at the point to which  is tangent. given the
above restriction on the values of p, we have

where i (i = 1, . . . , p) are the worldspace coordinates,
and  is a redshift factor;
for static spacetimes  =

k2. we shall call these static congurations minimal

worldspaces. for a vacuum superspace background the
spacetime is (n+1)-dimensional minkowski space, e(1,n).
in this case  = 0 because the (p+1)-form a is purely
fermionic. in addition,  = 1, so in this case a minimal
worldspace is a minimal surface in en in the usual sense.
we see that super p-branes provide a natural framework
for an extension of the notion of a minimal surface in
en to minimal worldspaces in more general riemannian
spaces.

supersymmetry did not play a major role in the above
discussion and it might be deemed an unnecessary com-
plication. however, a large class of minimal surfaces in
en are calibrated surfaces for which the calibrating p-
form, or calibration [4], admits a spinorial construction
[5]. let xm = (x0, xi ) be the minkowski spacetime co-
ordinates, with xi (i = 1, . . . , n) being cartesian coor-
dinates on en. then, for p = 1, 2 mod 4, the p-form
calibration takes the form

 = dxi1  . . .  dxip t 0i1...ip 

(2)

2 = 1 .

(6)

it follows that |  vol for all . since  is also closed
this means that it is a calibration. the contact set of the
calibration is the set of p-planes for which this inequality
is saturated. by the theorem of harvey and lawson,
these are the tangent planes of a minimal surface [4].

we see from (4) that an alternative characterization of

the contact set is that set of p-planes  for which

 =  .

(7)

because of (6) this equation is automatically satised for
any given tangent p-plane  and, since tr = 0, the
solutions  belong to a 1/2 supersymmetric subspace

the requirement that  be real restricts the spacetime di-
mension, and hence the space dimension n; the extent to
which the constraints on p and n may be relaxed will be dis-
cussed below.

of spinor space. however, this solution space generally
varies as  varies over the contact set so the solution space
of the set is generally smaller. the connection of calibra-
tions to supersymmetry observed in [6] is based on the
fact that the matrix  is closely related to a matrix with
similar properties appearing in the -symmetry transfor-
mations of the worldvolume elds of the super p-brane in
its lagrangian formulation. in fact, for time-independent
worldvolume elds in the gauge x0 = t the latter matrix
reduces to the one of (5), but in this context the condition
(7) is just the condition for preservation of some fraction
of supersymmetry; the total number of preserved super-
symmetries is the dimension of the solution space for .
note that although the specic form of the calibrating
p-form given above required restrictions on both p and
n, the results can be extended without diculty to all
those pairs (p, n) for which there exists a super p-brane
action. the possibilities were classied in [3] under the
assumption that the only bosonic worldvolume elds are
scalars, and these are the cases that we have in mind
here. the 11-dimensional supermembrane [2] is a simple
example with (p, n) = (2, 10). of course, many of the
results to be obtained will apply to other branes such as
d-branes and the m5-brane if one sets to zero any non-
scalar worldvolume elds.
in fact, most discussions to
date of the relevance of calibrations to branes have been
in the context of the m5-brane.

most previous discussions have also concentrated on
the case of branes in a at minkowski background. in
considering the extension to non-at backgrounds it is
convenient to distinguish between those for which the en-
ergy functional of a p-brane is still equal to the integral
of the p-volume and those for which the more general for-
mula (1) is required. in the former case, a static p-brane
is again a minimal surface and supersymmetric minimal
p-surfaces are calibrated by p-form calibrations in much
the same way as in the above discussion. the examples
of [7] are in this category. as we shall show here, the
recently discussed [8] lump solitons on the m2-brane in
an m-monopole background provide further examples of
kahler calibrations of this type, and there are a num-
ber of related kahler calibrations that we discuss. if, on
the other hand, a static brane of minimal energy is not
a minimal surface then it cannot be a calibrated surface
in the sense of [4], but it may still be a calibrated sur-
face in a more general sense because it may be calibrated
by a form that is not closed; examples are provided by
the ads calibrations [9] which calibrate p-surfaces of
minimum p-brane energy in anti-de sitter backgrounds.
the ads examples suggest a denition of a generalized
calibration, which we present here; we then show, by
a straightforward extension of an argument in [9], that
p-surfaces calibrated by such generalized calibrations are
minimal worldspaces. we discuss a number of examples
provided by m-branes in 1/2-supersymmetric m-theory
backgrounds.

another purpose of this article is to show how the
connection between calibrations and super p-branes fol-

lows directly from the supersymmetry algebra of noether
charges [10,11]. in particular, we shall see that all the
properties of generalized calibrations arise naturally in
this context. for this reason we shall begin with this
analysis. since the supersymmetry charges are integrals
of functions on phase space, it is natural to start from
the hamiltonian formulation, the details of which can be
found in [1214]. having dened the notion of a gen-
eralized calibration and proved the associated minimal
worldspace property of calibrated surfaces, we then move
on to the explicit examples.

ii. the supersymmetry algebra and

the calibration bound

we begin by making precise the constructions alluded
to in the opening paragraph. let zm = (xm, ) be
the superspace coordinates. the geometry of superspace
will be assumed to be determined by the lorentz frame
1-forms ea = (ea, e) and the (p+1)-form potential a;
we will assume throughout that the only non-vanishing
component elds are bosonic. the superspace (p+1)-
form a appears in the lagrangian form of the action via
its pullback to the worldvolume and the integrand can
be written in the form zmam where the dot denotes
dierentiation with respect to an arbitrary worldvolume
time t; the coecients am are the components of the one-
form a obtained by contraction of a with the p tangent
vectors spanning a tangent p-plane  to the p-dimensional
worldspace, i.e. a = a|. now let xm = (x0, xi ), where
k = /x0 is the timelike killing vector eld, and x the
time reparameterization invariance by choosing x0 = t.
then

zmam =  + xiai + a

(8)

where  is a supereld with the electrostatic poten-
tial density as its lowest component. as is custom-
ary, we use the same symbol to denote a supereld and
its lowest component. note that  is the worldspace
dual of the pullback of ika. the worldspace metric is
mij = ea
a and  is the
minkowski metric. omitting fermions it reduces, in the
x0 = t gauge, to

a = izm em

i eb

j ab where ei

mij = ixi jxj gij

(9)

where gij is the metric on a spatial section of spacetime,
i.e. the p-metric on worldspace is induced from the n-
metric on space.

the super p-brane lagrangian density can be written

as

l = zm pm  siei

a pa 

1
2

(cid:0)p2 + det m(cid:1)

where si and  are lagrange multiplers, and

pa = ea

m (pm + am ) .

(10)

(11)

2

this is not its fully canonical form because -symmetry
implies a constraint for which there is as yet no cor-
responding lagrangian multiplier. however, this con-
straint aects only the fermionic variables.
if we set
all worldvolume fermions to zero and use the identity
ixmam  0 then

l = xmpm  siixmpm 

1
2

(cid:0)p2 + det m(cid:1)

(12)

where, now, p2 = gmn pm pm, with pm = pm + am
and gmn the inverse of the spacetime metric gmn =
em

bab. now set

aen

pm = (h, pi ) ,
and impose the x0 = t gauge, to get

l = xi pi  h  siixi pi

(13)

(14)

where the hamiltonian density h is found by solving the
hamiltonian constraint p2 + det m = 0. this yields

h =  + vi pi +  hgij

(n) pi pj + det mi1/2

where

vi =

gti
(gtt)

,

 = 1/pgtt ,

(15)

(16)

and gij
(n) is the inverse of the spatial n-metric gij . for
simplicity we now restrict to static spacetimes, for which

vi vanishes. in this case  = k2. for static worldvol-

ume congurations we may set pi = 0 and the hamilto-
nian density reduces to

h =  + det m .

(17)

because k = t
is killing, mij and  are time-
independent. the integral of h over the worldspace
yields the potential energy functional e of (1).
supersymmetries of the background are associated
with killing spinor elds. in many simple cases these take
the form of a function times a constant spinor  subject to
a constraint of the form  =  where the constant ma-
trix  is characteristic of the background. in particular,
all 1/2-supersymmetric backgrounds have killing spinors
of this form with  a traceless matrix such that 2
 = 1.
we shall assume here that the background superspace
is of this type.
in addition, we continue to make the
inessential, but simplifying, assumptions that p = 1, 2
mod 4, and that spinors are real. in these cases we may
take the charge conjugation matrix to equal 0, where
the underlining indicates a constant lorentz frame ma-
trix. the matrix  of (5) can be generalized to non-at
spacetimes by taking

det m  = 0

where

(18)

3

 =

1
p!

i1...ipi1 xi1  ip xip i1...ip .

(19)

note that, given the restriction on the values of p, we
have

2 = (1)p det m .

(20)

given our assumptions about the background the super-
symmetry charges will take the form of spinor functionals
q subject to the constraint q = q. we will proceed
by taking this projection to be implicit, and checking con-
sistency at the end. with this understood we can write
the supersymmetry anticommutator as

{q, q} = 0z dp  [a pa + ] .

(21)

this result has not been directly established in full
generality but it agrees with the at space case [10] and
those non-at cases that have been analyzed [11]. that it
must be correct follows indirectly from considerations of
-symmetry, as will now be explained. the -symmetry
transformations were given in the required form in [13].
in particular, the transformations of the elds zm are
such that zm em

a = 0 and

zm em

 = [a pa  (1)p]  .

(22)

 vanishes for a bosonic background, and e

 =
 at  = 0, we may write the -symmetry transfor-

since em

mation as

 = [a pa  (1)p]  .

(23)

this gauge transformation allows half the worldvolume
fermions to be gauged away. the supersymmetry trans-
formations of the remaining half take the form

 =  + ()

(24)

where () is now a specic matrix function of world-
volume elds acting on the constant spinor . its precise
form depends on the -symmetry gauge choice and it has
the eect that  = m  for some matrix m [15]. the
matrix m depends on the worldvolume elds and hence,
for static elds, on the worldspace coordinates. at any
given point on worldspace it is a matrix for which half the
eigenvalues vanish. this is due to the fact that, locally,
the brane realizes half the supersymmetry non-linearly.
the spinors  corresponding to the linearly-realized su-
persymmetries are the eigenspinors of m with zero eigen-
value. these are the supersymmetries preserved, locally,
by the brane. the supersymmetries that are globally
preserved correspond to those spinors  that are eigen-
spinors of m with vanishing eigenvalue for every point
on worldspace. thus a worldvolume conguration is su-
persymmetric if the equation m () = 0 has solutions for
constant . this is equivalent to the equation  = 0.

we now note the identity

[a pa + ]  = (cid:2)(p2 + det m)  2(ixi pi )i(cid:3)  (25)
where i = mijjxi i . the right hand side vanishes as
a result of the hamiltonian and worldspace dieomor-
phism constraints. using these constraints we deduce
that  = 0 implies

[a pa + ]  = 0 ,

(26)

which is an alternative form of the condition for preser-
vation of supersymmetry that obviates the need to com-
pute the matrix m . this is the hamiltonian form of
the supersymmetry condition derived in [16,17] from the
lagrangian formulation. observe that the matrix multi-
plying  is precisely the matrix appearing in the {q, q}
anticommutator, as required for consistency because it is
manifest from (21) that eigenspinors of this matrix with
vanishing eigenvalue correspond to supersymmetries that
are preserved by the p-brane conguration.

we now turn to the consequences of the algebra (21)
for static congurations with pi = 0. given the normal-
ized spinor  of the earlier discussion we deduce from the
positivity of {q, q} that

 p0   t 0  0 .

(27)
the rst term on the left hand side is just det m, by
the hamiltonian constraint. for the second term we have

t 0 = |

(28)

where | is the evaluation on a tangent p-plane  of a
p-form  that is formally identical to (2) but now with
0 = 0 and dirac matrices i satisfying {i, j} =
2gij. thus, (27) is equivalent to

|   vol .

setting pi = 0, it follows from (21) that

2(q)2 = z dp [h  (ika + )|] .

(29)

(30)

the terms in the integrand other than h constitute a
central extension of the supertranslation algebra and it
follows from general considerations that such extensions
are topological. in other words, the p-form ika +  must
be closed. equivalently

d = f ,

(31)

where f = dika. a p-form  that satises both the
inequality (29) and the condition (31) will be called a
generalized calibration. this denition is modeled on
the denition of an ads calibration in [9], and ads cal-
ibrations are examples of generalized calibrations; we
will later provide some further examples that are not ads
calibrations.

it will now be shown that the calibrated manifolds of
a generalization calibration are minimal worldspaces; the

argument is a straightforward extension of the one given
for ads calibrations in [9]. let u be an open subset of a
calibrated manifold of a generalized calibration . then

zu

dp det m = zu



(32)

now let v be another open p-dimensional set in the same
homology class as u with v = u , and let d be a
(p+1)-surface with d = u  v . then

zu

 = zv

 +zd

d .

(33)

using (31) we have

zd

d = zd

d(ika) = zv

dp  zu

dp 

(34)

and hence

zu
 zv

dphdet m + i = zv
dphdet m + i

 +zv

dp 

(35)

where the inequality follows from (29). we conclude that

e(u )  e(v )

(36)

where e is the energy, and hence that u , initially dened
as a subset of the contact set of a generalized calibration,
is also a subset of a minimal worldspace. since u is
arbitrary we conclude that the entire calibrated manifold
of a generalized calibration is a minimal worldspace, as
claimed. we remark that if dika = 0, then the above
bound of the generalized calibration reduces to the bound
for calibrated manifolds saturated by minimal surfaces.
before proceeding to the examples we should discuss
one potential diculty with the application of the above
ideas. in many cases of interest, static branes are invari-
ant not only under time translations but also under some
number,  say, of space translations.
in fact, in these
cases the invariance group is usually the poincare group
of isometries of e(1,), in which case the brane congu-
ration has an interpretation as an -brane soliton on the
p-dimensional worldspace, i.e. an -brane worldvolume
soliton. for  > 0, the energy density is independent
of some directions and the total energy will be propor-
tional to the volume of e, which is innite. this problem
can be resolved by periodic identication of the  coor-
dinates. alternatively, we may minimise the energy per
unit -volume, which we also denote by e. this is

e = z dphdet m + i ,

(37)

where (for static spacetimes)  = det m, with m
being the induced metric on e(1,), and m is now the
induced metric on a section of the worldvolume with

4

constant e(1,) coordinates. similarly,  is induced by
ik0 . . . ika where k0, . . . , k are the translational killing
vector elds of e(1,). this is the functional used in [9]
to construct the ads calibration bound. for every con-
guration b that minimizes the above energy functional,
we nd a p-brane solution with topology e(1,)  b. the
considerations of supersymmetry that we have described
above for the  = 0 case can easily be extended to the
 > 0 cases. in particular, a generalized calibration sat-
ises

the line between the two centres. let n be a unit vector
in this direction. the metric is hyper-kahler so there are
three complex structures ir (r = 1, 2, 3). in particular,
the linear combination

j = nrir

(41)

is a complex structure. the lump conguration of the
m2-brane discussed in [8] is associated with the 2-form

 = dx1  dx2 + j ,

(42)

|   vol
d = f  ,

where f  = dik0 . . . ika.

(38)

where j is the kahler form of j with respect to the
hyper-kahler metric on m4. this is a kahler form on
e2  m4 and satises the inequality (29). it is therefore
a calibration. the calibration bound is

iii. m2-branes and generalized

calibrations

we shall begin by discussing some examples of ordinary
calibrations in non-at backgrounds. this will allow us to
provide an interpretation in terms of calibrations of some
recent work on sigma-model lump solitons on the m2-
brane [8]; specically we show that they correspond to
calibrated 2-surfaces associated to kahler calibrations.
we will then turn to the cases associated with generalized
calibrations.

the general setup for lumps on an m2-brane is a
probe m2-brane in a supergravity background of the form
e(1,2)  m8 with metric

ds2 = ds2(e(1,2)) + ds2

8 .

(39)

we embed the worldvolume and x the worldvolume
reparameterizations such that the e(1,2) coordinates
are identied with the worldvolume coordinates. we
then consider static worldvolume congurations ya =
ya(1, 2)}, where {ya; a = 1, . . . 8} are coordinates for
m8 and (1, 2) are the worldspace coordinates. the
m2-brane energy is then

e = z d2det m ,

(40)

where m is the metric induced from ds2
8. we see that, in
this case, the redshift factor  is unity, and  vanishes.
the case considered in [8] was m8 = e4  m4 with a
kk-monopole metric on m4. this is a circle bundle over
e3 with the circle degenerating to a point at the centres
of the metric, which are points in e3. the subcase con-
sidered in [8] was the two-centre metric, for which there
is a privileged direction in e3 dened (up to a sign) by

solutions to the cayley calibration equations found in [18]
were characterised there as octonionic lumps.

5

e  || ,

which is saturated by the lump congurations. these are
desingularized intersections of the m2-brane probe with
an m2-brane wrapped on the nite area holomorphic 2-
cycle of the background. this cycle can be decribed as
follows. let  be the s1 coordinate for the s1 bre of
m4 and choose the centres in e3 of the m4 metric to be
at u = l on the u-axis. then the 2-cycle is {, u;l 
u  l}.
to nd the energy of the lump soliton one must sub-
tract the vacuum energy of the m2-brane probe. to see
how this may be done we note that the energy of the lump
is independent of its size, which is arbitrary. a zero size
lump corresponds to a point intersection of the m2-brane
probe with the wrapped m2-brane. the two m2-branes
can then be moved apart, without changing the energy, so
that they overlap rather than intersect. we then have
two separate m2-branes, each of which must be a cali-
brated surface. this is evident for the probe m2-brane,
which is now an innite planar membrane in e4; it is cal-
ibrated by the two-form dx1  dx2 and its energy is the
innite vacuum energy. the energy of the lump soliton
is therefore equal to that of the wrapped m2-brane. the
energy is nite since the volume of this surface is nite.
the surface itself, described above, is calibrated by the
kahler 2-form j .

various generalizations of this construction are possi-
ble. a multi-centre metric has various nite area holo-
morphic 2-cycles around which an m2-brane may be
wrapped. intersections with another innite planar m2-
brane are again, when desingularized, lump solitons, al-
though there is now more than one type of lump. an-
other generalization arises from the fact that the 8-metric
ds2
8 could be any eight-dimensional ricci-at metric, al-
though it must have reduced holonomy if the background
is to preserve any supersymmetry. the possible reduced
holonomy groups are su (2), su (3), su (4), g2, spin(7)
and sp(2). for m2-brane probes in these backgrounds
the only relevant calibrations are of degree two, and the
supersymmetric backgrounds admitting a degree two cal-
ibration are those for which the holonomy group is su (2),

su (3), su (4) or sp(2). all these cases admit kahler
calibrations; the calibrated surfaces are holomorphic two-
dimensional subspaces.

so far we have not needed the full power of generalized
calibrations. these arise by placing m2-branes in a d=11
supergravity background with non-vanishing 4-form eld
strength. an example is provided by an m2-brane probe
placed parallel to a m2-brane background. the relevant
calibrations that describe the supersymmetric dynamics
of the probe are hermitian of degree two. the metric m
and the electrostatic potential  of (1) are induced via
the map xi() = i, ya = ya(), from the metric ds2 
gij dy i dy j and the 3-form f  dika, respectively,
where

ds2 = h  2
f = dh 1  dx1  dx2

3 (cid:2)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2(cid:3) + h

1

3 abdyadyb

(43)

and h is the familiar harmonic function of the multi m2-
brane supergravity solution. the redshift factor is  =
h  1
3 .

to dene the hermitian generalized calibration rele-
vant to this case it suces to give the hermitian form of
the complex structure on the 10-space. this is

j = h 1dx1  dx2 + k

(44)

where k is a (constant) kahler 2-form for e8. note
that f = dj , as required for a generalized calibration.
in addition, j is the two-form obtained from the almost
complex structure by raising an index with the rescaled
metric

ds2 = ds2 = h 1(cid:2)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2(cid:3) + abdyadyb . (45)

the almost complex structure is constant and hence in-
tegrable.
it then follows from wirtingers inequality
that j is a generalized calibration. the calibrated
surfaces are holomophic curves in the m2-brane back-
ground. note that the metric m induced on worldspace
by the rescaled metric ds2 is, in this case, such that
det m = det m.

there are many holomorphic curves in the m2-brane
background. for embeddings of the form xi = i,
ya = ya(), as above, they are roughly characterized by
the number of active transverse scalars. from the bulk
perspective, every pair of active scalars is interpreted as
the worldvolume coordinates of another m2-brane, so the
bulk interpretation of the solution with 2k active scalars
is that of k + 1 m2-branes intersecting, or overlapping,
(not necessarily orthogonally) on a 0-brane soliton, all
in the given m2-brane background. this interpretation
suggests that the proportion of the 32 supersymmetries
preserved by the probe m2-brane is 2(k+1), in agree-
ment with the proportion derived using the contact set
su (k + 1)/s(u (1)  u (k)) of the calibration (note that
for these examples the presence of the background does
not aect the count of supersymmetries).

iv. m5-branes and generalized

calibrations

lumps are also relevant to static m5-brane congu-
rations. for this we place a m5-brane in a background
of the form e(1,5)  m5 where the m5 metric is ricci
at and, for preservation of supersymmetry, has holon-
omy in su (2).
it follows that m5 = e  m4, with a
direct product metric such that the m4 metric has holon-
omy in su (2). the su (2) kahler calibration of degree
two discussed above is again applicable; the interpreta-
tion is as m5-branes intersecting on a 3-brane in a kk-
monopole background. however, there are now other,
higher-degree, calibrations to consider. one such case is
a degree four kahler calibration, which we now describe.
let (x0, xi) (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) be cartesian cordinates for
e(1,5), and let ya (a = 1, . . . , 4) be coordinates on m4.
consider the manifold e4  m4 where e4 is the subspace
of e(1,5) with constant x0 and x5. this is a kahler man-
ifold with kahler 2-form

 = dx1  dx2 + dx3  dx4 + j ,

where j is dened as for the case of the m2-brane.
we x the worldvolume dieomorphisms, and partially
specify the embedding of the m5-brane in spacetime, by
choosing x0 = t and identifying xi with the worldspace
coordinates i. in addition, we choose the four functions
ya to be independent of both the time and one of the
worldspace coordinates. this means that the m5-brane
has topology e(1,1)  b where b is a 4-surface param-
eterised by the other four worldspace coordinates. the
four functions ya dene a minimal embedding of b in m4
associated to the calibration 4-form

 =

1
2

   .

(47)

if we take m4 = k3 then the m5-brane is wrapped on
k3 and can be identied with the heterotic string [19].
we have now seen that this wrapping can be described
by saying that b is a minimal 4-surface in k3 calibrated
by an su (2) kahler calibration of degree four.

examples of generalized calibrations can be found by
considering an m5-brane probe in an m5-brane super-
gravity background, for which the metric and seven-form
eld strength are respectively

3 ds2(e(1,5)) + h

ds2 = h  1
f = dh 1  dx0  dx1  . . .  dx5 ,

2

3 ds2(e5)

(48)

where h is a harmonic function on e5, which we choose
to be

h = 1 +


r3

(49)

for positive constant . we assume here that the self-
dual 3-form eld strength on the m5-brane vanishes; oth-
erwise the theory of generalized calibrations elaborated

6

and the calibrated submanifold is given by the vanishing
locus of a holomorphic function f (z1, z2). the killing
spinors obey the conditions

012345 = 

12 = 67.

(53)

where the gamma matrices are in an orthonormal basis.
we conclude that the solution preserves 1
4 of bulk super-
symmetry. the bulk interpretation of the solutions is
that of two m5-branes intersecting (at su (2) angles) on
a 3-brane, with one of them parallel to the background.
su (3) hermitian calibrations: there are two cases to
consider. the rst is a degree two calibration with four
transverse scalars. the relevant metric and form eld
strength are, respectively,

ds2 = h 1(cid:2)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2(cid:3)
f 3 = dh 1  dx1  dx2 .

+ (dy1)2 + (dy2)2 + (dy3)2 + (dy4)2

(54)

the calibration two-form is

(50)

 = h 1dx1  dx2 + dy1  dy2 + dy3  dy4 ,

(55)

above would be inapplicable. the bianchi identity for
this eld strength then implies that the pull-back to the
worldvolume of the four form f must also vanish. this
condition is not satised for ve active scalars, so we con-
sider only those cases with four or fewer active scalars.
there are still many more such cases than there were for
the m2-brane. they include hermitian, special almost
symplectic (sas) and exceptional calibrations, gener-
alizing the corresponding calibrations that have been in-
vestigated in the near-horizon ads backgrounds [9]. the
calibration bounds depends on the degree of the calibra-
tion and the number of active scalars. we are therefore
led to an organisation in which we rst specify the num-
ber of active scalars and then consider the various degrees
for the calibration form. in what follows {x1, . . . , x5}
will denote the worldvolume coordinates of the m5-brane
which are transverse to the -brane worldvolume soli-
ton and {y1, . . . , yn}, n  5, will denote the transverse
scalars. as in the m2-brane case, it is convenient to
consider a rescaled metric. taking this rescaling into ac-
count, we have

1

hh  1

3 ds2(e(5)) + h
ds2 = 
5

f  = dh 1  dx1  . . .  dx5 ,

2

3 ds2(en)i

where  = h  +1
3 . the static solutions will be m5-
branes with topology e(1,)  b, where b is a calibrated
surface of dimension p  . we now consider the various
subcases in turn.

a. hermitian m5-brane calibrations

there are four hermitian calibrations relevant to the
m5-brane which are best distinguished by the group that
rotates the complex planes in their contact set.
in all
cases, the calibrated submanifold b is a holomorphic sub-
manifold of the m5-brane background.

su (2) hermitian calibrations: these are degree two
calibrations with two transverse scalars. the relevant
four-dimensional metric and form eld strength are

which is again the hermitian form of a complex structure.
the holomorphic coordinates are {z1 = y1 + iy2, z2 =
y3 + iy4, z3 = x1 + ix2} and the calibrated surfaces
can be described as the vanishing locus of two holomor-
phic functions f 1(z1, z2, z3), f 2(z1, z2, z3). the killing
spinors satisfy the conditions

012345 = 

12 = 67
12 = 89 ,

(56)

from which we deduce that the solution preserves 1
8 of
(bulk) supersymmetry. the bulk interpretation of the
conguration is as intersecting m5-branes at su (3) an-
gles for which the corresponding orthogonal intersection
is

ds2 = h 1(cid:2)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2(cid:3) + (dy1)2 + (dy2)2
f 3 = dh 1  dx1  dx2 ,

respectively. the calibration 2-form is

 = h 1dx1  dx2 + dy1  dy2 ,

m 5 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,,,,
m 5 0,,, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,,
m 5 0,,, 3, 4, 5,,, 8, 9.

(57)

the other su(3) hermitian calibration is a degree four
calibration with two transverse scalars. the relevant
metric and form eld strength are

(51)

(52)

which is the hermitian form of a complex structure. the
complex coordinates are {z1 = y1 + iy2, z2 = x1 + ix2}

for a multi-centre m5-brane solution we would need further
restrictions on the number of active transverse scalars in order
to satisfy this condition.

7

the rst of these conditions can be interpreted as due either
to the background or to the probe, so the examples being con-
sidered are those for which the background does not impose
additional constraints.

the complex coordinates are {z1 = y1 + iy2, z2 = y3 +
iy4, z3 = x1 + ix2, z4 = x3 + ix4} and the calibrated
manifolds can be described as the vanishing locus of two
holomorphic functions f 1(z1, z2, z3, z4), f 2(z1, z2, z3, z4).
the conditions on the killing spinors are

012345 = 

12 = 67
34 = 67
67 = 89 ,

(66)

from which we deduce that the solution preserves 1
the bulk supersymmetry.

16 of
in all of these cases it is clear that f  = d, as required
for consistency.
in addition, in all the above cases an
alternative interpretation of the solutions is as m5-branes
with topology e(1,)  c, for either  = 1 or  = 3, where
c is a (5  )-dimensional holomorphic cycle.

b. sas calibrations

the special almost symplectic calibrations (sas) of
ads7  s4, which is the near horizon geometry of the
m5-brane, have a natural generalization in the full m5-
brane background. the sas calibrations associated with
a m5-brane probe placed parallel to a m5-brane super-
gravity background have degrees two, three, or four (a
calibration of degree ve would have to involve the 2-
form tensor eld and is therefore excluded). the degree
two sas calibration is identical to the degree two her-
mitian calibration explained in the previous section. it
therefore remains to describe the sas calibrations with
degrees three and four. for sas calibrations the num-
ber of transverse scalars is the same as the degree of
the calibration. so the degree three sas calibration is a
three-dimensional submanifold in a six-dimensional man-
ifold and the degree four calibration is a four-dimensional
submanifold in a eight-dimensional manifold.

for the degree three sas calibration, the relevant met-

ric and form eld strength are

ds2 = h  1

+ h

1

2(cid:2)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2(cid:3)
2(cid:2)(dy1)2 + (dy2)2(cid:3).

f 1 = dh 1  dx1  dx2  dx3  dx4 ,

(58)

respectively. to describe the calibration form, we intro-
duce the hermitian form
 = h  1

2(cid:2)dx1  dx2 + dx3  dx4(cid:3) + h

2 dy1  dy2 . (59)
the corresponding complex structure can be found by
raising an index with the metric dened by ds2. the
calibration form is  = 1

1

2   . in particular,

 = h 1dx1  dx2  dx3  dx4
+ dx1  dx2  dy1  dy2
+ dx3  dx4  dy1  dy2 .

(60)
the holomorphic coordinates are {z1 = y1 + iy2, z2 =
y3 + iy4, z3 = x1 + ix2} and the calibrated surfaces can
be described as the vanishing locus of a holomorphic func-
tion f (z1, z2, z3). the killing spinors satisfy the condi-
tions

012345 = 

12 = 67
34 = 67 ,

(61)

so the solution preserves 1
8 of the bulk supersymmetry.
the bulk interpretation of the conguration is as inter-
secting m5-branes at su (3) angles for which the corre-
sponding orthogonal intersection is
m 5 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,,
m 5 0,,, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
m 5 0, 1, 2,,, 5, 6, 7.

(62)

su (4) hermitian calibration: the calibration of inter-
est from the m5-brane perspective is the degree four cali-
bration with four transverse scalars. the relevant metric
and form eld strength are, respectively,

ds2 = h  1

+ h

1

2(cid:2)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2(cid:3)
2(cid:2)(dy1)2 + (dy2)2 + (dy3)2 + (dy4)2(cid:3).

f 1 = dh 1  dx1  dx2  dx3  dx4 .

(63)

to describe the calibration form we introduce the her-
mitian form

 = h  1

+ h

1

2(cid:2)dx1  dx2 + dx3  dx4(cid:3)
2(cid:2)dy1  dy2 + dy3  dy4(cid:3) .

then the calibration four-form is  = 1

2   , i.e.

 = h 1dx1  dx2  dx3  dx4
+ (cid:2)dx1  dx2  dy1  dy2
+ dx1  dx2  dy3  dy4
+ dx3  dx4  dy1  dy2
+ dx3  dx4  dy3  dy4(cid:3)
+ hdy1  dy2  dy3  dy4

ds2 = h  2

+ h

1

3(cid:2)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2(cid:3)
3(cid:2)(dy1)2 + (dy2)2 + (dy3)2(cid:3)

f 2 = dh 1  dx1  dx2  dx3 ,

(64)

respectively.

to proceed we introduce the orthonormal frame

ep = h  1

3 dxp ,

1  p  3
1  p  3
the almost symplectic form is dened as

e3+p = h

6 dyp ,

xp=1

ep  e3+p = h  1

3

xi=1

dxi  dyi .

(65)

8

(67)

(68)

(69)

using the almost complex structure associated with this
almost symplectic form, the calibration form is found to
be

  re(e1 + ie4)  . . .  (e3 + ie6)
= h 1dx1  dx2  dx3  dx1  dy2  dy3
 dy1  dx2  dy3  dy1  dy2  dx3

(70)

repeating the same arguments as in the ads case in [9],
the calibrated submanifolds are seen to be determined by
a single real function f (x1, x2, x3) such that

yi =


xi f (x1, x2, x3)

h 1mnmnf = det(ijf ) .

(71)

the killing spinors of such solutions satisfy the condi-

tions

 = re(e1 + ie4)  . . .  (e4 + ie8)
= h 1dx1  dx2  dx3  dx4
 dx1  dx2  dy3  dy4
 dx1  dy2  dx3  dy4
 dx1  dy2  dy3  dx4
 dy1  dy2  dx3  dx4
 dy1  dx2  dy3  dx4
 dy1  dx2  dx3  dy4
+ hdy1  dy2  dy3  dy4 .

(77)

as in the previous case, the solutions are determined by
a single real function f (x1, x2, x3, x4) such that

yi =


xi f (x1, x2, x3, x4)
detm|m(ijf )

h 1mnmnf = xm

(78)

012345 = 
034567 = 
024568 =  ,

where detm|m denotes the determinant of a matrix with
the m-th row and column omitted. the killing spinors
of these solutions obey the conditions

(72)

and so the conguration preserves 1
8 of the bulk super-
symmetry. the bulk interpretation of the solution is that
of three intersecting m5-branes, possibly at su (3) an-
gles, for which the associated orthogonal intersection is

m 5
m 5
m 5

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,,,
0,,, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
0,, 2,, 4, 5, 6,, 8.

(73)

alternatively, the solution describes a m5-brane with
topology e(1,2)  b, where b is a three-dimensional sas
calibrated submanifold.
for the degree four calibration, the relevant metric and

form eld strength are

ds2 = h  1

+ h

1

2(cid:2)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2(cid:3)
2(cid:2)(dy1)2 + (dy2)2 + (dy3)2 + (dy4)2(cid:3)

f 1 = dh 1  dx1  . . .  dx4 ,

respectively. we again introduce the frame

ep = h  1

4 dxp ,

e4+p = h

1

4 dyp ,

1  p  4
1  p  4 ,

and the symplectic form

 

4

xp=1

ep  e4+p =

3

xi=1

dxi  dyi .

(74)

(75)

(76)

using again the almost complex structure associated with
, the calibration form is found to be

012345 = 

12 = 67
13 = 68
14 = 69
and so they preserve 1
16 of the bulk supersymmetry. the
bulk interpretation of the solutions is as four intersect-
ing m5-branes, possibly at su (4) angles, for which the
corresponding orthogonal intersection is

(79)

m 5 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,,,,
m 5 0,,, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,,
m 5 0,, 2,, 4, 5, 6,, 8,
m 5 0,, 2, 3,, 5, 6,,, 9.

(80)

alternatively, the solution describes a m5-brane with
topology e(1,1)  b, where b is a four-dimensional sas
submanifold.

c. exceptional calibrations

there are three exceptional calibrations to consider as
follows: the cayley calibration which is a degree four
calibration with four transverse scalars. the relevant
eight-dimensional metric and form eld strength are

ds2 = h  1

+ h

1

2(cid:2)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2(cid:3)
2(cid:2)(dy1)2 + (dy2)2 + (dy3)2 + (dy4)2(cid:3)

f 1 = dh 1  dx1  . . .  dx4 ,

(81)

respectively. the calibration four-form can be con-
structed from the metric and a spin(7) invariant self-dual
four-form on e8, viz

9

 = h 1dx1  dx2  dx3  dx4 +(cid:2)dx3  dx4  dy3  dy4
+ dx2  dx4  dy2  dy4 + dx2  dx3  dy2  dy3
+ dx1  dx3  dy2  dy4 + dx1  dx2  dy1  dy2
+ dx1  dx3  dy1  dy3 + dx1  dx4  dy1  dy4
+ dx2  dx4  dy1  dy3  dx1  dx2  dy3  dy4
 dx1  dx4  dy2  dy3  dx3  dx4  dy1  dy2
 dx2  dx3  dy1  dy4(cid:3)
+ hdy1  dy2  dy3  dy4 .

(82)

the equations which the transverse scalars satisfy are
h 1(1y  2y i  3y j  4y k) = 2y  3y  4y
+ 1y  3y  4y i  1y  2y  4y j
+ 1y  2y  3y k

(83)

together with the second order auxiliary condition

im [ (1y  2y  3y  4y )i
+ (1y  3y + 2y  4y )j
+ (1y  4y  2y  3y )k] = 0 ,
(84)
2 (abc cba),
where y = y1 + iy2 + jy3 + ky4, a b c = 1
2 (ab  ba) and i, j, k are the imaginary unit
a  b =  1
quaternions. the killing spinors satisfy the conditions

012345 = 

34 = 89
23 = 78
12 = 67
14 = 78 ,

(85)

so the solution preserves 1

32 of bulk supersymmetry.

the associative calibration is a degree three calibra-
tion with four transverse scalars. the relevant seven-
dimensional metric and form eld strength are

ds2 = h  2

+ h

1

3(cid:0)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2(cid:1)
3(cid:0)(dy1)2 + (dy2)2 + (dy3)2 + (dy4)2(cid:1)

f 2 = dh 1  dx1  dx2  dx3 ,

(86)

respectively the calibration three-form is constructed
from the above metric and the structure constants of oc-
tonions as follows:

 = h 1dx1  dx2  dx3 +(cid:2)dx1  dy1  dy2
+ dx3  dy1  dy4 + dx2  dy2  dy4
+ dx2  dy1  dy3  dx1  dy3  dy4
 dx3  dy2  dy3(cid:3) .

(87)

the equations which the transverse scalars satisfy are

 h 1(1y i + 2y j + 3y k) = 1y  2y  3y ,
(88)

10

where y is dened as in the cayley case. the conditions
on the killing spinor are

012345 = 

23 = 89
13 = 79
13 = 68 ,

(89)

so this conguration preserves 1
metry.

16 of the bulk supersym-

the coassociative calibration is a degree four calibra-
tion with three transverse scalars. the relevant seven-
dimensional metric and form eld strength are

ds2 = h  1

+ h

1

2(cid:0)(dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2(cid:1)
2(cid:0)(dy1)2 + (dy2)2 + (dy3)2(cid:1)

f 1 = dh 1  dx1  . . .  dx4 ,

(90)

respectively. the calibration four-form is constructed
from the above metric and the dual form of the struc-
ture constants of octonions in e7 as

 = h 1dx1  dx2  dx3  dx4
+ (cid:2)dx3  dx4  dy2  dy3 + dx2  dx4  dy1  dy3
+ dx2  dx3  dy1  dy2 + dx1  dx3  dy1  dy3
 dx1  dx2  dy2  dy3  dx1  dx4  dy1  dy2(cid:3) . (91)

the transverse scalars of this calibration satisfy the equa-
tions

 h 1(y1i + y2j + y3k) = y1  y2  y3 , (92)
where  = 1 + i2 + j3 + k4; i = /xi. the condi-
tions on the killing spinors are

012345 = 

34 = 78
12 = 78
24 = 68 ,

(93)

so the solutions preserve 1
16 of the bulk supersymmetry.
in all the above three types of calibration, f  = d as
required for consistency.

v. conclusions

we have shown that generalized calibrations arise nat-
urally in the context of supersymmetric congurations of
p-brane actions. in particular, we have derived the gener-
alized calibration bound from the p-brane supersymme-
try algebra. we have also presented several examples of
such calibrations in m-brane backgrounds. these exam-
ples by no means exhaust the possibilities. an obvious
generalization would be to consider 1/4 supersymmetric,

intersecting-brane, backgrounds determined by two har-
monic functions. more generally still, one can take any
supersymmetric intersecting brane conguration in at
spacetime and replace one of the participating branes by
its corresponding supergravity solution. one then ex-
pects to recover the full intersecting brane conguration
as a generalized calibration of a probe brane in this back-
ground. our examples are exclusively m-theoretic but
string theory examples can easily be found and many are
simply related to those discussed here by some duality
chain.

the main limitation of calibrations is that the theory
is inapplicable in those cases for which there are active
worldvolume vectors or tensors, as can happen for string
theory d-branes and the m5-brane. here again, how-
ever, many such cases are related to calibrations via du-
ality chains so this limitation is not as severe as might
be thought. we should point out that calibrations were
discussed in the d-brane context in [20]. there is also
the posibility that a reformulation of d-branes and the
m5-brane in which worldvolume vectors and tensors are
induced from an extended spacetime, as recently pro-
posed [21], might allow a direct extension of the theory
of calibrations to these cases too.
