abstract

this paper discusses in a systematical way exact retarded solutions to the
classical su(n ) yang-mills equations with the source composed of several
colored point particles. a new method of nding such solutions is reviewed.
relying on features of the solutions, a toy model of quark binding is suggested.
according to this model, quarks forming a hadron are inuenced by no con-
ning force in spite of the presence of a linearly rising term of the potential.
the large-n dynamics of quarks conforms well with wittens phenomenol-
ogy. on the semiclassical level, hadrons are color neutral in the gauss law
sense. nevertheless, a specic multiplet structure is observable in the form
of the regge sequences related to innite-dimensional unitary representations
of sl(4, r) which is shown to be the color gauge group of the background
eld generated by any hadron. the simultaneous consideration of su(n ),
so(n ), and sp(n ) as gauge groups oers a plausible explanation of the fact
that clusters containing two or three quarks are more stable than multiquark
clusters.

i. introduction

in this paper, we look into the yang-mills-wong (ymw) theory, a classical non-abelian
gauge model describing closed systems of several spinless colored point particles interacting
with a gluon eld. emphasis is put on features of exact solutions, some of which were
obtained previously [1,2], nd others are discussed for the rst time.

a solvable nonlinear model is of interest by itself. further still, one may expect that exact
solutions of the ymw theory will be useful in studying nonperturbative vacua of quantum
chromodynamics (qcd). we get, at the least, a toy model of bound states in qcd.

it may appear at rst glance that classical particles have nothing to do with real quarks,
but closer inspection casts doubt on this belief. indeed, a medium of the normal nuclear
density oers a fertile ground for creations and annihilations of quark pairs. nevertheless,
the quark-antiquark sea is largely suppressed in hadrons. according to zweigs rule, a quark
and an antiquark with opposite quantum numbers defy their annihilation. such persistence
of particles is typical for the classical picture.

the classicality of constituent quarks is dicult to understand, but one can describe it
explicitly. the bulk of the hadron phenomenology is grasped by planar diagrams, which
implies in particular that world lines of valence quarks are subjected to neither bifurcation
nor termination in the feynman path integral, unless hadrons collide or decay. thus, to a
good approximation, the number of bound quarks remains xed.

starting from the qcd lagrangian, wong was able to show [3] that the behavior of a
quark in the limit h  0 is governed by the classical equation of motion of a spinless colored
point particle. 1 alternative methods of dequantization [4] lead to classical actions of
the spinning particle with wongs action as a constituent. thus the classical limit of the
quark dynamics remains to be completed. wongs dynamics may provisionally be regarded
as the simplest reasonable approximation to the limiting theory. in addition, it would be
appropriate to use spinless particles as the starting point of the bound quark description, for
measurements of the polarized proton structure in deep inelastic leptoproduction indicate
that quarks carry only a small fraction of the spin of the nucleon [5]. the wong particles
will hereafter be called quarks though this name is rather conventional and should not be
confused with the standard qcd term, taking into account that the wong color charges are
in the adjoint while quark elds are in the fundamental representation of the gauge group.
as is well known, the classical limit of qcd is related to the limit of large number of

colors [6]. substituting su(3)c by su(n) and going to the limit

n  ,

g2n = const,

t hooft established that the planar diagrams are dominating in this limit [7]. witten found
[8] that the real hadronic world is qualitatively displayed even in the zeroth approximation
of the 1/n expansion. in the limit n  , the vacuum expectation value of the product

1the present model is not quite that obtained in the original wong approach. we deal with
arbitrary number of color particles while wongs procedure is matched with a single particle; the
situations are apparently dierent if one keeps in mind the nonlinear eld dynamics.

note, however, that the connement problem is out of the question now.

of gauge invariant operators obeys the so-called factorization relation, and quantum uctu-
ations disappear [8]. thus qcd becomes a classical theory as n  . we suggest that
the large-n ymw theory is intimately related to the classical limit of qcd.
indeed, it
is conceivable that quarks constituting a hadron experience an attractive constant force
originating from a term of the potential a which linearly rises with distance between the
quarks, and such a behavior of a is to provide the area law for the wilson loop functional [9].
are we correct in interpreting the area law as the evidence of the constant attractive force?
as will be shown, an exact classical solution a with the linearly rising term actually exists.
although this term contributes to the eld strength, it produces no force. the general reason
for such a surprising result is the conformal invariance. the linearly rising term violates the
scale invariance. while such a violation being allowable for the gauge quantities a and f,
it cannot be tolerated for observables. one may expect a dimensional parameter, measu-
ring a gap in the energy spectrum and violating the scale symmetry, to emerge only upon
quantization leading to anomalies. meanwhile exact classical solutions are crucial in learning
the symmetry of the vacuum.

one believes two phases of the strong interacting matter to exist, hot and cold, which
must be distinguished by their symmetry. at high temperatures, the asymptotical freedom
dominates, hence the conventional su(3)c symmetry is inherent in the hot phase. on the
other hand, neeman and sijacki [10] developed an exhaustive phenomenological classi-
cation of hadrons on the basis of innite-dimensional unitary representations of sl(4, r),
which hints that sl(4, r) is the cold phase symmetry. where does this sl(4, r) come from?
coleman [11] argued that the symmetry of the vacuum is the symmetry of world. given
the vacuum invariant under sl(4, r), excitations about it possess the same symmetry. since
the symmetry of the gluon vacuum is nothing but the symmetry of the background eld, the
responsibility for sl(4, r) rests with the background described by a certain solution of the
qcd equations in the classical limit. it is the background generated by quarks in hadrons
that provides the sl(4, r) relief for gluon excitations.

we will nd two classes of exact retarded solutions to the classical yang-mills (ym)
equations. solutions of the rst class, invariant under su(n), appear to be related to the
background in the hot phase. solutions of the second class might be treated as the back-
ground generated by bound quarks in the cold phase. these solutions are complex valued
with respect to the lie algebra su(n), but one can convert them to the real form to yield
the invariance under sl(n, r) or its subgroups. in particular, the background generated by
any three-quark cluster is invariant under sl(4, r), and that generated by any two-quark
cluster is invariant under sl(3, r).

notice that sl(4, r) of neeman and sijacki operates in spacetime while the present
sl(4, r) acts in the color space. however, we attempt to interweave two arenas by reference
to that color degrees of freedom may be convertible into spin degrees of freedom, the fact
discovered by jackiw and rebbi, and hasenfratz and t hooft [12].

the paper is organized as follows. section ii outlines the general formalism of the
ymw theory. the next section is devoted to a justication of the ansatz whereby we
seek exact retarded solutions of the ym equations with the source composed of several
arbitrarily moving quarks. finding such solutions is traced by the simplest example of the
single-quark source, sec. iv. properties of the background generated by two-quark sources

3

are reviewed in sec. v. fields generated by arbitrary number of color particles, and their
features are considered in sec. vi. we show that bound quarks are aected by no external
force as n  . the equation of motion of a dressed quark is discussed, and its exact
solution in the absence of external forces is given. the large-n dynamics of quarks is
shown to conform with wittens phenomenology. moreover, a step forward can be made
by the simultaneous consideration of su(n), so(n), and sp(n) as gauge groups, which
oers a plausible explanation of the fact that clusters composed of two or three quarks
are more stable than multiquark clusters. the stability of the solutions is the subject of
sec. vii. we conclude that free quarks are ruled out by a consistency reasoning. issues
concerning the semiclassical quantization and the resulting picture are considered in sec.
viii. the fullment of the wilson criterion has been conrmed. we show that any hadron
is color-neutral in the sense of the gauss law. nevertheless, a certain multiplet structure is
observable. these multiplets are described by innite-dimensional unitary representations
of sl(4, r), the gauge group of the background eld generated by any hadron.

ii. general formalism

we work in minkowski space with the metric  = diag(+, , , ). let us consider
classical point particles interacting with the su(n) yang-mills eld. the particles will be
called quarks and labeled by index i, i = 1, . . . , k. each quark is assigned a color charge
qa
i (transforming as the adjoint representation of su(n), the color index a runs from 1
to n 2  1), and a bare mass mi
0. any other specication is omitted, so that quarks and
antiquarks are indistinguishable in the present context. let every quark be moving along a
timelike world line z
i (i ) parametrized by the proper time i . this gives rise to the current

j(x) =

k

xi=1

z di qi(i ) vi

(i) 4[x  zi (i)],

(2.1)

where qi = qa
ith quark. the action is written [13] as

i ta, ta are generators of su(n), vi

  zi

/di is the four-velocity of

s =

(2.2)

here, i = i(i) are time-dependent elements of su(n), zi = ea
stants whereby the color charge is specied, qi = izi1
i

. the eld strength is

i ta, ea

i being some con-

f = a  a  ig [a, a],

with g being the coupling constant. the middle two terms of eq. (2.2) can be combined into
i a(zi). since i responds
i = 1i, the gauge invariance of the action is

p tr zi1
to a local gauge transformation by i  
quite clear. elements ta of the lie algebra su(n) satisfy the commutation relations

i d i with the covariant derivative d  d/di + v

[ta, tb] = ifabct c

(2.3)

4

with the structure constants fabc of su(n), and the orthonormalization condition

tr (ta tb) = ab.

(2.4)

note that the invariance of the action under su(n) automatically entails the invariance
under sl(n, c) unless a constraint is imposed so as to preserve the real-valueness of the
gauge eld variables. if we have no prior knowledge of the symmetry, it can be identied by
the structure constants which are present in the action. the specic values of fabc entering
into eq. (2.3) imply that s is invariant under su(n). however, for any simple complex
lie algebra, there exists a basis, referred to as the cartan basis, such that the structure
constants are found to be real, antisymmetric and identical to the structure constants of the
real compact form of this lie algebra [14]. the basis of su(n) is simultaneously the cartan
basis of its complexication sl(n, c). thus the presence of the structure constants of su(n)
in eq. (2.3) needs not be the evidence for that the symmetry of s is su(n); allowing for
the complex-valued eld variables, we enlarge the symmetry up to sl(n, c).

the euler-lagrange equations for the action (2.2) are the yang-mills equations

with d =   ig[a,

], the equation of motion of ith bare quark

e  df + 4j = 0


i  mi

0 a

i  vi

 tr [qi f (zi)] = 0,

where a

i  v

i is the four-acceleration of this quark, and the wong equation

qi = ig [qi, vi

 a(zi)]

describing the evolution of the color charge of ith quark.

it follows from eq. (2.7) that

d
di

tr q2

i = 2ig tr(qi [qi, vi

a]) = 0,

i.e., the magnitude of qi remains unchanged, specically, qi may be constant.

the total color charge of a k-quark system is dened by

q = z

dj,

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

where the integral is taken over an arbitrary spacelike hypersurface , and the domain
of integration covers all k points of intersection of  with the world lines. however, it
would be more convenient to do with somewhat narrow class of hypersurfaces with a rigidly
xed mutual arrangement of any hypersurface and the world lines in the vicinities of their
intersections. consider, for example, the intersection of a hyperplane by a timelike curve
at a right angle. such an arrangement can be achieved for any hypersurface  by replacing
a small fragment of  in the vicinity of every intersection point zi
 by a fragment of a
hyperplane orthogonal to the world line at zi
 and smoothing o this piecewise hypersurface.
the resulting hypersurface will be called locally adjusted and denoted by .

5

since j is not a conserved current, the total color charge q is in general hypersurface

dependent. but q ceases to depend on  if the color charge of each quark is constant,

qi = 0,

(2.9)

which imposes certain restrictions on the form of a. we will discuss just this case.

in view of eq.

(2.5), the denition of q can also be rewritten in terms of the eld

variables:

q =

1

4 z 

ddf .

(2.10)

under the local gauge transformations

a  1a 

i
g

1,

the covariant derivatives of the eld strength transform as

df   1df ,
so that eq. (2.5) is covariant providing j transforms as

j  1j.

one could always nd such unitary matrix  as to diagonalize hermitean matrix j. since
the lie algebra su(n) is of rank n  1, there exist n  1 diagonal elements hi. thus,
without loss of generality, one can set

qi(i) =

n 1

xi=1

ei
i(i ) hi.

(2.11)

we will nd ei

i to be constants xed exactly by the solution itself.

picking qi in the form (2.11) reduces the gauge freedom of a. the color charges qi
may thereon be rotated within the cartan subgroup, in particular, through discrete angles
associated with permutations of hi. we will see that the diagonalization of qi leads to

[qi, vi

 a] = 0

(2.12)

which can be treated as a gauge xing condition.

the symmetric energy-momentum tensor is

t =  + t,

where

 =

 f f ),

(2.13)

t(x) =

xi=1

(i) vi

(i) 4[x  zi(i )].

one can readily verify the noether identity

t  =

4

tr (e f ) +

k

xi=1

z di 

i 4[x  zi(i )],

(2.14)

(2.15)

where e and 

i are the lhss of eqs. (2.5) and (2.6), respectively.

as is well known (see , e.g., [15]), the conformal invariance is ensured by the condition

t 

 = 0.

leaving aside sophistications regarding the modication of the energy-momentum tensor on
the quantum level [16], we merely remark that the ym sector is conformally invariant for



 = 0.

equation (2.13) shows that this condition is met for d = 4. thus, in the 4d case, the space-
time symmetry of the ym equations is enlarged to include the conformal transformations.

the regularized total four-momentum can be dened as

p = z 

dt,

(2.16)

where the integration of  is taken over an adjusted hypersurface  with small invariant
holes cut out by the future light cones drawn from points on the world lines slightly below
their intersections with .

to gain insight into the ymw dynamics, one should nd simultaneous solutions of eqs.
(2.5), (2.6), and (2.7). at rst, one solves eq. (2.5), i.e., a is expressed in terms of z
i .
since the resulting eld is singular on the world lines, its insertion into eqs. (2.6) and (2.7)
brings to ultraviolet divergences. there are two means of tackling this diculty, the mass
renormalization and the restriction to such situations that eq. (2.7) can be put in its trivial
form qi = 0. upon the mass renormalization, one derives an equation of motion of the
dressed quark allowing for nite self-action. finally, if one succeeds in solving this equation,
then the set of dynamical equations is entirely integrated.

a more rened approach is to use the noether identity (2.15), implying that the equation
of motion of the dressed quark is due to substituting a solution of the ym equations into the
equation of motion of the bare quark, accompanied by the mass renormalization. on the
other hand, eq. (2.15) expresses the local energy-momentum balance of the whole system.

iii. ansatz

it is easily seen that the coecients for highest derivatives in eq. (2.5) coincide with

those in maxwell equations. thus the characteristic cones are identical in both theories.

the retarded signal is of primary importance for every 4d classical eld theory because
it is associated with the idea of causality. let us turn rst to the single-quark case. with

7

a given point of observation x, such a signal carries information on a single point of the
world line, zret

 . indeed, the support of the retarded function of the wave equation

dret(x) = 2 (x0) (x2)

(3.1)

is localized on the boundary of the future light cone, with the expression (3.1) containing
no derivatives. the advanced function dadv(x) reveals similar properties but its physical
meaning is less clear. other green functions carry signals from several points or even from
some region of the world line.

thus the retarded ym potential a generated by a single quark may depend on two
kinematic quantities, the four-velocity v at the retarded instant ret and the lightlike vector
r = x  zret
we recall elements of technique of covariant retarded quantities [17] [19]. consider a
plane built out of r and v. a normalized vector u orthogonal to v and the lightlike
vector

 drawn from the point of emission, zret

 , to the point of observation, x.

can be drawn here. all this is expressible analytically as

c  v + u

(3.2)

v2 = u2 = 1,

v  u = 0,

c2 = 0,

c  v = c  u = 1,

r =  c,

where the scalar

represents the distance between zret
v.

 = u  r = v  r
 and x in the reference frame with the arrow of time

(3.3)

from the condition r2 = 0, one readily derives the following rules of dierentiation:

 = c,

 = v + [ (a  u)  1] c.

(3.4)

(3.5)

this enables us to nd derivatives of any kinematic quantities, for example, v = ac.

let us further turn to the k-quark case. dene the retarded invariants

i  ri  vi,

ij  vi  (ri  rj ),

ij  vi  vj ,

where i, j = 1, . . . , k, and vi

ij  (ri  rj )2 = 2 ri  rj ,
 is taken at  ret

. we have

i

(3.6)

ij = [ai  (ri  rj )  1] ci

 + ijcj
,

8

ij = (ai  vj ) ci

 + (aj  vi) cj
,

ij = 2 (ijci

 + j icj

).

thereafter the generic retarded solution to eq. (2.5) is

a(x) =

k

xi=1

n 21

xa=1

ta (vi

 f ai + ri

 hai),

(3.7)

(3.8)

where the sought functions f ai and hai may depend on i , ij , ij, and ij [2].

the expression (3.8) is inserted in eq. (2.5) and the dierentiations are made by means
of eqs. (3.4), (3.5), and (3.7). one gets the expressions in which it is necessary to equate to
zero the coecients for the linearly independent vectors ci
, as well as for each
color basis element ta. recall that we search for solutions of the ym equations o the quark
world lines where the dierentiation formulas (3.4), (3.5), and (3.7) are just valid. if the
procedure is to be self-consistent, we must separately equate to zero coecients for every
scalar kinematic quantity of which f ai and hai are independent, e.g., scalars containing ai
.
a distinctive feature of this procedure is that any supplementary condition on a is
unnecessary. we thus arrive at a class of equivalence of solutions a related by gauge
transformations rather than a particular potential.

, vi

one should emphasize that the ansatz (3.8) rests crucially on the following points: the
eld is massless; the dynamics is gauge invariant; the signals are retarded; the dimension of
spacetime is four; the world lines are timelike.

given a massive eld, the support of the retarded green function is the interior of the
past light cone. therefore the expression (3.8) is no longer solution of the eld equation. it
is clear that this scheme is unsuited for the dynamics without gauge invariance; the case is
typied by replacing    by .
we recall also that, in 2n-dimensional spacetimes with n > 2, the retarded function is
built out of derivatives of the -function, therefore the retarded signal carries information
on vret
it would be necessary to supplement the expression
(3.8) by appropriate kinematical terms. as to (2n + 1)-dimensional spacetimes, the retarded
signal carries information on the entire history of the source preceeding the point zret
 , and
the huygens principle underlying our approach turns out to be invalid.

 as well as aret

 , and the like.

iv. yang-mills field generated by a single quark

if the source is a single quark, then it is sucient to consider the gauge group su(2).

the extension to su(n) oers no signicant changes in the nal results.
we specify a moving basis of the color space spanned by a triplet a

1, a

2, a

(with qa precessing around vaa

 in the color space) obeying the condition of orientability

where abc are the structure constants of su(2), and the condition of orthonormalization

these relations are equivalent to eqs. (2.3) and (2.4).

a retarded solution of eq. (2.5) is written [1] as

now, the gauss law can be represented in its familiar form: the ux of the generali-

rounding the source with the color charge qa, equals 4qa, other terms cancel out.2

combination with eqs. (4.3) and (4.5)(4.7), this yields the color charge of the quark

we draw attention to the non-analytical dependence of aa

nontrivial background in the semiclassical description.

2although this result was established in the single-quark case [19], it can be extended to the general
k-quark case proceeding from eq. (2.10) and taking advantage of a locally adjusted hypersurface
.

10

for  = 0, the condition (4.4) does not appear, and the retarded solution is

aa

(4.9)

with q being an arbitrary constant. considering the eld invariants

one recognizes the conguration (4.3) to be neither self-dual nor anti-self-dual. equation
(4.3) describes the eld of the magnetic type while eq. (4.9) describes the eld of the electric
type.

if the retarded condition is replaced by the advanced one, then we arrive at similar
expressions for the potential and the eld strength, the only modication is the change
of sign for ia
(4.3) and (4.6) as well as for the term in the square brackets of
eq. (4.7). this implies that the spacetime and color arguments of aa
 are correlated in a
specic fashion; under time reversal, associated with replacing the retarded condition by the
advanced one, the isotropic directions in the color space a
2 interchange.

with real-valued aa
. elements of the new basis can be represented by traceless imaginary-
valued 2  2 matrices satisfying the commutation relations of the lie algebra sl(2, r), as
becomes clear upon specifying the abstract basis by pauli matrices j = j/2.
it may appear that the doubling of colored degrees of freedom is attributable to opposite
color charges, as eq. (4.8) suggests. however, the complex-conjugate potentials (4.3), being
represented in the matrix form, are interconvertible by the gauge transformation

with

a = 1 a 

 = 1 = 1.

thus the availability of opposite color charges is deceptive in the single quark case.

to sum up, we have the retarded solutions (4.3) and (4.9) describing the ym eld of two
dierent phases. the rst phase is specied by the noncompact gauge group sl(2, r) while
the second by the compact group su(2).

let us verify that eqs. (4.3) and (4.9) give an exhaustive collection of retarded solutions
to eq. (2.5) in that there are no other functions fj() and hj() representing solutions. the
potential generated by a single quark is

insert it into eq. (2.5). from the requirement of vanishing the coecient for a, one obtains

which is readily integrated to yield

 f 

j + fj = 0

fj() =

ej = const.

(4.11)

substituting eqs. (4.10) and (4.11) in eq. (2.7) results in divergent terms which cannot
be removed by the standard renormalization procedure since there is no physical parameter
of an appropriate dimensionality at our disposal. this diculty can be circumvented, if one
takes all constants of integration in eq. (4.11) to be zero, with one exception, say, e3. thus,

a
3 = 0.

there remains the possibility of arbitrary rotations of a

3. having
regard to the gauss law applied to small distances, we impose an additional restriction on
the class of sought functions: the behavior of hj() should be less singular than that of
fj(), namely,  hj()  0 as   0. then, due to lack of nite parameters whereby these
rotations can be specied, we conclude that

latter case, we separately equate to zero the coecient for a  u and the sum of remaining

and in addition three equations resulting from eqs. (4.14), (4.16), and (4.18) by the complex
conjugation and the replacement of h+ by h.

we have arrived at an apparently overdetermined set of equations: nine equations are
used to determine three sought functions. it can be resolved if some compatibility conditions
are satised, and this is accomplished if the constants of integration take certain xed values.
(4.13)(4.16) and their complex-conjugate are linear, we are seeking the

since eqs.

simultaneous solution of these equations in the form

h3  exp(3),

h+  exp(+),

h = h+.

we get 3 = 2 or 3 = 1 from eq. (4.13), and 3 = 0 or 3 = 1 from eq. (4.15). hus,
eqs. (4.13) and (4.15) are mpatible if

h3 = 3 exp().

(4.19)

one can nd next + = 2 + ige3 or + = 1 + ige3 from (4.14), and + = 0 or
+ = 1+ige3 from (4.16). thus eqs. (4.14) and (4.16) are mpatible if + = 1+ige3. the
compatibility can also be established in the case + = 0 which is achievable for e3 = 2i/g
or e3 = i/g.
let us examine further the compatibility of eqs. (4.14), (4.16) with eq. (4.17). assuming
h+h 6= 0, we conclude from eq. (4.17) that

  + + 2ige3 = 0.

this equation is satised identically for + =  = 1 + ige3, but it has no solution when
+ =  = 0. the compatibility of eqs. (4.14), (4.16) and (4.17) is also established for
+ =  = 0 if

h+ h = 0.

(4.20)

we consider lastly the compatibility of eq.

(4.13)(4.17). taking
+ = 1 + ige3, in combination with eq. (4.19), we obtain e3h+ = 0, while the complex-
conjugate equation yields e3h = 0. this implies either e3 = 0, with reducing the potential
(4.12) to the form

(4.18) with eqs.

(4.21)

(4.22)

recall that r/ =  , so that the potential (4.21) is purely gauge while the expression
(4.22) diers from eq. (4.9) by a gauge term.

for + =  = 0, eq. (4.18) becomes

[e3 (2  ige3) + exp(2) h3] h+ = 0.

(4.23)

if e3 = 2i/g, then eq. (4.23) reduces to h+h3 = 0, nd the complex-conjugate equation is
h h3 = 0. this provides two possibilities. first, h+ = h = 0, resulting in a purely gauge
potential, eq. (4.21). second, h3 = 0, which is allowable for 3 = 0, and taking into account
eq. (4.20), one arrives at the expression (4.3).

in the case e3 = i/g, eq. (4.23) is satised only for h+ = 0. with the corresponding
result for the complex-conjugate equation, namely, h = 0, we return to the potential (4.21).
so, the compatibility of all the equations is established if the relation (4.20) holds. in
the case h+ = h = 0, there is no constraint on the parameter e3 which yields eq. (4.9).
on the assumption of vanishing only h (or only h+), one should equate e3 to 2i/g (or
2i/g), and this results in eq. (4.3). this completes our justication of the uniqueness of the
retarded solutions (4.3) and (4.9).

v. yang-mills field generated by two quarks

a detailed procedure of obtaining exact retarded solutions of eq. (2.5) with the source
composed of two quarks, starting from the ansatz (3.8), was given in [2]. we thus dwell on
analytical and geometrical features of these solutions.

we adopt su(3), the minimal group whereby the retarded eld generated by two bound
quarks is constructed. the point is that the eld of a bound quark occupies individually
some sl(2, r) cell of the color space while sl(3, c) contains two such cells.

one usually realizes su(3) with the aid of the gell-mann matrices ta = a/2. it is more
convenient, however, for our purposes to use an overcomplete color basis spanned by the
nonet of 3  3 matrices including three diagonal matrices

(5.9)

therefore, only one of eqs. (5.7)(5.9), say, eq. (5.7), will thereafter be referred to.

taking into account the gauss law, one nds the color charge of ith quark

qi = 

2i
g

hi.

(5.10)

thus the solutions suggest the existence of two-quark systems with the total color charges

q(+) =

2i
g

(h1 + h2) and q() = 

2i
g

(h1 + h2).

(5.11)

therein lies the most outstanding distinction from the single-quark case where the complex-
conjugate potentials, being interconvertible by gauge transformations, originate from the
same source. as for the present case, it is impossible to convert the complex-conjugate
solutions to one another since there exists a nonzero eld invariant

c3 = tr (f f 

 f )

which is of dierent signs for the complex-conjugate solutions. so, we have two dierent
eld congurations generated by two sources with the total color charges q(+) and q(). it
follows from eq. (5.11) that no colorless two-quark cluster is feasible on the classical level.
let us turn to the spacetime dependence of the solutions. it was found in [2] that f ii and
hii are independent of 12 and 12, whereas 12 is shown by the factor 2 (12) = (r1 r2).
since r1 and r2 are lightlike, the equality r1  r2 = 0 is ensured only for collinear r1
and r2. in view of the factor (r1  r2), this means that the linearly rising term of a is
localized on the enveloping surface of two families of rays

x = z1

( ) + () n,

n = z1

  z2

, n2 = 0, n0 > 0,

and

x = z2

( ) + () m,

m = z2

  z1

, m2 = 0, m0 > 0,

parametrized by  and . at the intersection of a spacelike hyperplane with this surface,
two fragments of a curve arise. thus the force lines of the ym eld corresponding to the
linearly rising term of a are squeezed to a string. this is not a nite string joining two
quarks. what we have now are two half-innite strings which begin at the positions of the
quarks and go outward at dierent sides to spatial innity.

by the construction of the enveloping surfaces, they are ruled surfaces. having lightlike
rulings and timelike directrices (the world lines), we nd warped worldsheets of the strings.
there exists also an alternative solution identical to eq. (5.7) in every respect except

the linearly rising term that is stripped of the factor (r1  r2),

).

(5.12)

now the linearly rising terms describe the force lines distributed over all directions of space.

the solution (5.12) is truly non-abelian because

[a, a] 6= 0,

[a, f ] 6= 0.

how can the nonlinearity of the ym equations be compatible with that a is the sum of
two single-quark potentials? equation (5.12) does combine two such terms, yet making no
hint about the plausibility to represent the solution as an arbitrary superposition of them.
if either of terms with some coecient dierent from 1 is added to another, no new solution
arises.

it should be realized that eq. (5.12) describes the ym elds generated by a system of
two bound quarks. would the eld be generated by two free quarks, the sign of the color
charge of any quark might be subjected to variation regardless of the sign of the color charge
of other quark. in the present case, however, changing the signs for the rst one-quark term
and leaving intact the signs for the second one-quark term, we arrive at the expression that is
no longer solution as it is clear from that e
23 do not commute. one may change the
signs only simultaneously for both terms. this correlation of signs is precisely the evidence
that we are dealing with bound quarks.

12. he adequacy of the gauge group su(2) in the single-quark
case is thus conrmed; the non-abelian piece of the solution is built out of color vectors
forming the lie algebra su(2). the eld invariant c3 is zero for both eqs. (4.3) and (5.14).
it is no great surprise that sl(2, c) stands out against sl(n, c), n > 2, in the single-
quark case. the metrical structure of the base embodied in the lorentz group sl(2, c) is all
that should be mapped by the future light cone into the ber, so that the color space sl(2, c)
is the only exact image. based on so(n) or sp(n) as the starting point, one reaches the
same solution since su(2)  so(3)  sp(1), and sl(2, r)  su(1, 1)  so(2, 1)  sp(1, r) [14].
on the other hand, given so(n) or sp(n) in the two-quark case, we have other results
as opposed to su(n). both the so(4, c) and so(5, c) color spaces are suitable for an
accommodation of two elementary color cells so(3, c)  sl(2, c). but so(4, c) is not
semisimple, and the cartan-killing metric is singular here. as for so(5, c), it is isomorphic
to sp(2, c), and we envisage two alternatives in the description of the color space in the
two-quark case, either sl(3, c) or so(5, c)  sp(2, c).

vi. yang-mills field generated by several quarks

the discussion of solutions of the ym equations with the source composed of k quarks
echoes in many respects that in the two-quark case. we adopt now the gauge group su(n)
with suciently large n, at least n  k + 1, to allow an accommodation of all k quarks.

a. solutions

we use the cartan-weyl basis of the lie algebra su(n) spanned by the set of n 2 matrices

it increases each index of hi and e
i k+1 by one, and the transformed a turns out to be a
new solution. other solutions can be obtained by repetitions of this gauge transformation.
[a similar situation already encountered in the two-quark case where the solutions (5.7)(5.9)
were shown to convert to each other by transformations of this sort].

the solution (6.4) describes a background eld generated by k quarks which form some

k-quark cluster. the color charge of ith quark [cf. eq. (5.10)] is

qi = 

2i
g

hi.

the total color charge of such a cluster [cf. eq. (5.11)] is either

q(+) =

there are also solutions describing background elds generated by several clusters. each
cluster is dened by the condition that the signs of the color charges are simultaneously
either + or  for every quark of the cluster whereas relative signs of the total color charges
of the clusters are arbitrary. for example, the potential generated by two two-quark clusters
is a = a1

omitting (ri  rj ) in eqs. (6.4) and (6.5) gives alternative solutions [cf. eq. (5.12)].

at last, there exist solutions describing ym elds of free quarks with the color charges

qi =

( hi+1  hi).

for example, the ym eld of two free quarks (labeled by numbers 1 and 3) is

changes the  signs of the rst square bracket of eq. (6.6) while the signs of the second
remains invariable. it is easy to recognize this gauge transformation as that rendering the
potential complex-conjugate in the single-quark case. thus the color charge of the free quark
is determined modulo exp(in).

there is a number of ways to separate a given k-quark system into groups of clusters of
a certain quark content and free quarks. we interpret them as scenarios of hadronization.
we now look at the symmetry of these solutions. one can dene (k + 1)2 traceless

imaginary matrices hn and e 

mn as follows:

hn  i hn,

e 
mn  i e

mn

which are elements of the lie algebra sl(k +1, r). thereafter, every solution above becomes
real valued with respect to this basis. the solutions constructed from m 2 such elements
obeying the closed set of commutation relations are invariant under sl(m, r), m  k + 1.
in particular, the ym eld generated by a two-quark cluster (meson) is invariant un-
der sl(3, r) and that of a three-quark cluster (barion) is invariant under sl(4, r). since
sl(3, r) is a subgroup of sl(4, r), the ym eld of every hadron is specied by the gauge
group sl(4, r). this symmetry is independent of n and is retained in the limit n  .

for  = 0, the ym equations linearize, and one gets an abelian solution

a =

k

n

xi=1

xn=1

en
i hn

vi

i

,

(6.7)

where en

i are arbitrary parameters. the gauge symmetry of this solution is su(n).

we have obtained two types of solutions corresponding to two phases of matter. the ym
background of the rst phase is invariant under the noncompact gauge group sl(k + 1, r)
while that of the second phase is invariant under the compact gauge group su(n).

20

b. energetical considerations

it follows from the trace relations

tr (hl e

mn) = 0

that the linearly rising term of a does not contribute to the color force

f 
i = vi

 tr [qi f (zi)].

(6.8)

(6.9)

thus, the well-known mechanism of quark binding by a constant force lacks support from
the exact solutions of the classical ym equations.

a surprising thing is that the linearly rising term of a, while ensuring nonzero contri-
bution to the eld strength f, results in no force. an explanation is simple. equation
(6.9) includes the scalar product of two color vectors f and qi which are not arbitrary;
they come from the exact solutions and turn out to be orthogonal to each other.

one can nd from eq. (6.8) and

tr (e

mn e

mn) = 0

(6.10)

that the linearly rising term of a does not contribute to color singlets altogether. this
is because it depends on either e+
mn, not both. a more fundamental reason is the
conformal invariance of the 4d classical ym theory which implies that the parameter 
violating the scale symmetry cannot manifest itself in observables.

mn or e

the energy-momentum tensor can be splitted into

 is the self-action term containing the contribution of the ym eld generated by

 is the interaction part comprised of mixed contributions.

where i
ith quark and int

the four-momentum p dened by eq. (2.16) contains divergent terms due to i

s.
if the solution is invariant under sl(k + 1, r), the self-energy of each quark is negative
denite. this suggests that such backgrounds are most favorable at zero temperature. it
is the energetical advantage that enables attributing them to the gluon vacuum in the cold
world.

the self-energy is positive-denite for the solutions invariant under su(n). these solu-
tions seem to be related to the hot phase. [one should mention also the congurations [20]
invariant under su(n) with an energy lower than that of the coulomb solution].

however, it is beyond the scope of this work to review a temperature-dependent version
of the ymw theory. we merely drew a parallel to the yang-mills-higgs (ymh) theory
where two classical solutions with dierent symmetries also exist. the solution with broken
symmetry being stable and energetically favorable corresponds to the cold phase. although
the solution with unbroken symmetry is unstable (thus bearing no relation to physical world),
its availability on the fundamental level motives the quest of a phase with such a symmetry.
the present situation contrasts with that of the ymh theory in three aspects. first, there
is no spontaneous symmetry breakdown. we deal with solutions invariant under two dierent

21

real forms of the complex group sl(n, c). the occurrence of the solution invariant under a
noncompact group dierent from the initial one is a new eld-theoretic phenomenon referred
to as the spontaneous symmetry deformation [2]. the epithet spontaneous emphasizes that
the scenario of hadronization is accomplished quite accidentally.

second, both solutions are now stable against small disturbances (see sec. vii).
third, the critical point  = 0 is independent of parameters appearing in the action, as
opposed to the ymh theory where the spontaneous symmetry breakdown is directly related
to parameters controlling the convexity of the higgs potential.

let us turn to the self-action problem. we follow the basic teitelboim pattern [21]
developed in the maxwell-lorentz theory. the su(n) phase is treated with no noticeable
distinctions from electrodynamics; one needs simply to substitute everywhere e2 by q2
i.

a completely dierent situation arises in the cold phase. after the mass renormalization,
the negative deniteness of the eld energy does not disappear without leaving a trace. it
reveals itself in the wrong sign of the radiation energy of accelerated quarks [1,19],

dei

=

2
3 | tr q2

i | a2

i < 0.

(6.11)

thus the self-action of a quark in the cold phase is such that the ux of energy is directed
inward the source. this feature of the self-action is unrelated to the boundary condition;
replacing the retarded condition by the advanced one leaves the direction of the ux intact.
to gain better understanding of this point, one should derive the equation of motion of

a dressed quark. taking into account eqs. (2.13)(2.15), one can nd [1,19]

mi [ai

 + 0 ( ai

 + vi

 a2

i)] = v

i tr[qif(zi)].

(6.12)

here, mi is the renormalized mass of ith quark, f is the eld of all other quarks at the
position of ith quark z

i , and

a similar parameter in electrodynamics 0 = 2e2/3mc2  1013 cm is related to the
classical radius of electron. every eect of the scale 0 is neglected there, keeping in mind
that quantum phenomena come into play already at the range of the compton wavelength
of electron  = h/mc  1011 cm. on the contrary, the classical radius of quark in the cold
phase far exceeds its wavelength, 0  , since, in the semiclassical treatment, the coupling
g is held to be much less than 1, and therefore

equation (6.12) can be rewritten as

where the operator

projects vectors on a hyperplane normal to the four-velocity v, and

p = m (v + 0 a).

(6.15)

(6.16)

note that eq. (6.14) is newtons second law governing the behavior of an object specied
by its point of location z and four-momentum p dened by eq. (6.16). we call this object
the dressed quark, or the color complex [19], keeping in mind the eld-mechanical origin of
p.

the invariance of the action (2.2) under the local reparametrizations

 = ,

z = v

endows the equation of motion of a bare quark with the factor . the regularization of
p indicated in sec. ii ensures that such an invariance remains valid after the mass renor-
malization. thus the form of the dynamical equations of bare and dressed quarks is the
same, only their four-momenta p are distinct in the dependence on kinematical variables.
the complex is unaected by the radiation reaction; the newtonian behavior of this
object implies that only external force acts on it. the hallmark of the complex is not the
evolution law, which is not uncommon, but the indeniteness of p0, as eq. (6.16) suggests.
on the other hand, eq. (6.12) expresses the local four-momentum balance: the incre-
 originates from the total eect of all other quarks
i di [19]. the greater the

ment of the complex four-momentum dpi
v
i tr [qif(zi)] di and the absorbed four-momentum, 0 vi
acceleration (determined by the total eect of other quarks) the greater the absorption.

 a2

a more familiar viewpoint is that eq. (6.12) describes the evolution of an object with the
four-momentum p = m v, visualized as a point particle. the behavior of such a particle
is beyond the control of the newton second law. departures from the newtonian behavior
are commonly attributed to the radiation reaction. this is a source of many paradoxes [19].

for a vanishing rhs of eq. (6.12), one gets the solution

v = {cosh(c + de/0), n sinh(c + de/0)},

where c and d are constants, and n is a xed unite vector. thus, in the absence of the
external force, the absorption of energy is exponentially decreasing in time, and the motion of
the color complex asymptotically approaches galileos inertial regime. the solution describes
a straight world line when the asymptotical condition a  0,    is imposed.
and unlike ones repel. however, it follows from the trace relations

we further turn to the interquark forces. in the cold phase, like color charges attract

tr (hj+1  hj )2 = 2,

tr (hj+1  hj ) hi = 0

(6.17)

that a free quark, while experiencing the self-action, does not act on other quarks.

we have seen that, in the cold phase, each quark individually occupies some sl(2, r) cell.
neither of two backgrounds generated by dierent quarks may be contained in the same
sl(2, r). this is similar to the pauli blocking principle. just as a cell of volume h3 in the

23

phase space might be occupied by at most one fermion with a denite spin polarization, so
any sl(2, r) cell is intended for a background of only one quark. choosing so(n) or sp(n),
instead of su(n), one singles out the same color sell so(2, 1)  sp(1, r)  sl(2, r).
by contrast, in the hot phase, assuming the total color charge of quarks in a given plasma
lump to be zero, the parameters en
i in eq. (6.7) are to be appropriately tted. then the
most energetically advantageous eld conguration is such that the color charges of quarks
are lined up into a xed color direction, thereby reducing su(n) to su(2). this bears some
resemblance to the bose-einstein condensation in the color space.

thus the color pauli principle preventing a body of k + 1 color cells against shrinkages
is an evidence of that the large-n limit is adequate to the cold phase description, whereas
the color bose-einstein condensation suggests the suciency of su(2) for the hot phase.
consider n   limit in the cold phase, assuming the coupling g to be xed. (note

that the factorization condition is therewith assured). the relations

tr (hi)2 = 1  n 1,

tr (hi hj) = n 1

(6.18)

show that the color repulsion between bound quarks vanishes in this limit, unless the number
of quarks at the given cluster is of order n. thus k-quark clusters with k = o(n) are
unstable while any cluster of nite number of quarks survives as n  .
this is in agreement with wittens phenomenology [8], where mesons made out of quark-
antiquark pairs are stable and noninteracting (their decay and scattering amplitudes are
suppressed, respectively, as 1/n and 1/n), and barions, imagined as n-quark clusters,
are unstable (the barion-barion and barion-meson vertices are respectively of order n and
1).

in the present context, however, barions being considered as three-quark clusters turn
out to be stable. the consistency with wittens phenomenology is true for both mesons and
multiquark clusters with the number of quarks of order n.

thus, the classical ymw quarks do not interact as n  . the quark binding is
characterized only by the correlation of signs of the color charges of quarks comprising a
cluster. since the color self-action prevents the motion from the runaway regime, the quarks
could be conceived as moving along parallel straight world lines. this accords with an
intuitive idea of the ground state of a cluster with zero orbital momentum. 3

switching on electromagnetic forces violates this equilibrium. it is possible, however, to
introduce the electrodynamical terms of the action in conjunction with choosing the ym
coupling g such that

| tr q2

i | =

4
g2 (1 

1
n

) = e2.

(6.19)

this enables a consistent treatment of orbital motions. it follows from eqs. (6.18) and (6.19)
that the centrifugal force is nite while the absorbed ym energy exactly compensates the

3a similar situation occurs in the monopole dynamics. as was shown by manton [22], the
monopoles forming a static multimonopole are inuenced by no intermonopole forces; they are
balanced due to exact cancellation of the repulsive magnetic ym force and the attractive higgs
force.

24

radiated electromagnetic energy, and helical world lines are no longer infrared troublesome.
moreover, the resulting picture is free of ultraviolet divergences.

unfortunately, this attractive possibility may pretend only to a toy status. with the
actual value of the elementary electric charge e2  1/137, eq.
(6.19) results in g  24
invalidating the semiclassical tratment. furthermore, the electric charge of real quarks
takes two values e/3 and 2e/3 so that the picture of accelerated quarks emitting no energy
can be matched with only either type of quarks (and with electroneutral two-quark clusters).

vii. stability problem

we have found that the ymw bound quarks are balanced being in the state of indier-
ent equilibrium. one should then examine the spectrum of excitations about the classical
background. in order that a given cluster be stable, the energy of every mode (the transla-
tion mode apart) must be positive; if the balance is upset by some external inuence, then
excitations responsible for increasing the energy should occur.

for our prime interest is in the ground state of clusters where the quarks rest relative
to each other, we consider the static background eld generated by such quarks. set b =
a + b where a is a static conguration, and b is a small disturbance about a. as can
be readily shown (see, e.g., [23]), the positivity of the excitation energy about a given static
background a is tantamount to that the equation of excitations

2s

(7.1)

has no solution exponentially increasing with time. any oscillatory solution exp (ikt) de-
termines a positive mode k  2
let us show that the single-quark solution (4.3) is stable against small eld disturbances
[25]. in the static case, when v = (1, 0, 0, 0), z( ) = z(0) + v , the proper time  is
identied with the laboratory time t, nd the retarded distance  with the usual radius r.

k. (for a more extended discussion see, e.g., [24].)

as is well known [23], the classical limit h  0 is equivalent to that of the weak coupling
g  0. taking into account that the expression (4.3) depends on g as g1, we must retain
only quantities of order g0 in eq. (7.1).
let us take the gauge condition vba
 = 0 for any quark world line. then the color charge
. in the

of the quark remains constant qa = 0 even with the presence of the excitations ba
static case, this condition is reduced to

among the spatial components of ba, we must separate only those which are orthogonal

to the gauge modes. this is guaranteed by the condition [26]

ba
0 = 0.

which, in the weak coupling limit, becomes

ba + gf abc bb  bc = 0,

ba = 0.

and taking into account eq. (7.2), we obtain [25]

it is clear from eq. (7.3) that b3 does not violate the stability of the background aa
.

b(t, r) = z

gion, ylm(, ) is a spherical vector harmonic, kj(s) is expressed in terms of the conuent
hypergeometric function

kj(s) = sj eis f (j  1, 2j + 2, 2is),

and j runs through values which are positive roots of the equation

j(j + 1) = l(l + 1) + 4,

l = 1, 2, . . . .

(7.7)

(7.8)

we are looking for solutions in the class of functions with an appropriate behavior at spatial
innity and singular points of the background. every solution corresponding to a negative
root of eq.
(7.8) is more singular than the background (4.3) at r = 0, and should be
excluded. the solution b+ is obtained from eq. (7.6) by replacing t by t.
kj(s) is regular at s = 0 while, in the limit s  , it has the asymptotic

kj(r) = [cjr + dj + o ((r)1) ] exp(ir)

(7.9)

where cj and dj are certain known constants.

note that the simultaneous presence of b+ and b ensures a nonvanishing contribution
to the energy-momentum tensor. from the behavior of b at spatial innity, eq. (7.9), it
follows that the four-momentum p is infrared divergent, and the semiclassical treatment of
the cold phase turns our to be inconsistent. therefore, scenarios of hadronization with the
presence of free quarks must be ruled out.

let us turn to the problem of stability of the solution (4.9). we restrict ourselves to the
static case which though is hard justied now if one remembers the runaway problem. thus
we consider only necessary (not sucient) conditions of stability.

26

equation (4.9) is independent of g, hence  (2i/g) must be replaced by q in each foregoing

relation. equation (7.4) converts to the form

(

equations (7.7)(7.9) are modied appropriately,

kj(s) = sj eis f (igq + j + 1, 2j + 2, 2is),

l = 1, 2, . . .

kj(s) = o (sigq1 eis),

s  .

(7.10)

(7.11)

(7.12)

(7.13)

it is clear from eq. (7.13) that q must be real for b to decrease as 1/r at spatial innity,
similar to the background (4.9). let us compare their behaviors at r = 0. from eq. (7.11)
it follows that kj(s) is regular at s = 0 if j  0. write the positive solution of eq. (7.12),

j =

1
2

(q(2l + 1)2  4g2q2  1),

and take l = 1, the minimal allowable value, then one nds that j is positive for

g2q2  2.

(7.14)

a similar result was obtained by mandula [27]. thus the solution (4.3) is stable whereas
the solution (4.9) would be so provided that q is a real quantity less than 2/g.

we next go to the two-quark case. decompose b into vectors of the color basis (5.1)

(5.6),

b =

3

xn=1

[ bn

 hn +

3

xk=1

( bkn

 e

nk + bkn+

kn )].

we restrict ourselves to the situation of static quarks. we adopt the gauge condition

b0 = 0,

which ensures the constancy of the color charges of both quarks. let us consider the back-
ground potential (5.7). now, by repeating what was done in the single-quark case, we nd
that bn satisfy eqs. (7.2) and (7.3) while b23 and b13 satisfy eqs. (7.2), (7.4) and (7.5)
with r playing the role of 1 for b23 and 2 for b13. from this identication, one checks
the stability of these components. note that b23 and b13 are associated with the position
of corresponding quarks while bn does not relate to either quark specically.

as for b12, it obeys eq. (7.2) and

where the operator  acts on the variables t and x, and ri = |x  zi|. one can see that
b12 uctuates with respect to both quarks, hence quark binding is ensured by just this
component of excitations. it is essential to gain insight into the behavior of solutions of eq.
(7.15) at spatial innity.

if the quarks are separated by distance d, then, for ri  d, eq. (7.15) is reduced to the

wave equation, and its asymptotical solutions are either

(7.17)

(7.18)

the solution (7.17) poses no infrared problem. by contrast, the solution (7.16) gives rise to
the infrared divergence of p and should therefore be considered as redundant.

the analysis of stability of the background (6.4) generated by k-quark clusters is iden-

, i = 1, . . . , k entails the infrared divergences of p
due to their asymptotical behavior, eq. (7.9), and the situation cannot be remedied by mere
selecting scenarios of hadronization. how to exclude such excitations, is not yet understood.
a possible direction in which one might search is studying a nonlinear problem of stability
with the requirement that every excitation becomes purely gauge at spatial innity.

the existence of excitations bi k+1



viii. semiclassical treatment

we have seen that the linearly rising term of a produces no conning force. this brings

up a question: is wilsons criterion fullled? from the trace relations

tr e

mn = tr hn = tr (e

mn e

mn) = tr (hn e

mn) = 0,

it follows that the loop operator

w (c) = tr p exp [ig ic

dz a(z)]

with the background a develops the perimeter law for both phases.

consider the eect of gluon excitations b about a in the cold phase. substitution of

b = a + b to the ym action gives

s(b)  s(a) +

(y).

although s(a) is divergent it should be discarded, just as in electrodynamics. due to the
gauge invariance, the dierential operator 2s/aa
 is irreversible, and a gauge-xing
term of the lagrangian is called for. (it would be reasonable for the present purposes to use
some linear gauge-xing condition to avoid complications associated with the faddeev-popov
ghosts). thereafter a certain nonsingular lagrangian of gluon excitations results,

 ab

l = ba

(x)  

ab (a; ) bb

where  

ab (a; ) is a background-dependent reversible dierential operator.
we average w (c) over either of two complex-conjugate backgrounds a+

 or a
 ,

z d bc

 exp [z d4x ba

this integral can be readily worked out to yield

exp [ic

dz g ab

(8.1)

where g ab

 (y, z) is the gluon propagator obeying the equation

 
ab (a; )(y) g bc

 (y, z) = c

a 

 4(z).

 (y, z) tends to a constant as (y  z)2 
the area law for eq. (8.1) would be the case if g ab
. since the behavior of the propagator at spacelike innity is the same as that of
excitations ba
 which obey the corresponding homogeneous equations, the responsibility for
the area law rests with the excitations bj l
 approaching asymptotically a constant as r  ,
the redundant solution of eq. (7.15). thus wilsons criterion is fullled, though the area
law cannot already be interpreted as an evidence of the classical attractive constant force
between quarks composing a cluster.

note also that the area law stems from the excitations described by the redundant
solution rendering p infrared divergent. this resembles the situation with the energetical
criterion valid for the prerenormalization stage when p is still ultraviolet divergent.

we learnt from the exact ym solutions that every classical cluster has a certain nonzero
color charge. the situation reverses on the semiclassical level where the color neutralness of
clusters is attained on the average of the gluon vacuum.

given a k-quark cluster, one may dene the gluon vacuum as a state with no excitation
about the background generated by this cluster. this state is represented by a vector of
hilbert space  such that the expectation value of every color-invariant quantity coincides
with its classical value. however, there are invariants which are nite and of dierent signs for
the complex-conjugate potentials a+
 f ) with
the complex-conjugate solutions (6.4). requiring the uniqueness of the vacuum expectation
value of c3, one has inevitably to assign (, c3) = 0. let + and  be vectors of hilbert
space associated with + and  terms of eq. (6.4). being eigenvectors of the total color
charge operator q [dened by eq. (2.10)],

 , as exemplied by c3 = tr (f f 

 and a

q  = q() ,

29

they are mutually orthogonal,

if the gluon vacuum is dened as

(, +) = 0.

 =

1
2

(+ +  ),

(8.2)

where  = exp i is an arbitrary phase factor, then one gets

(, q ) = 0.

thus the condition of the color neutralness of k-quark clusters is met on the average of the
gluon vacuum; the cluster nds itself partly at the state + with the color charge q(+) =
2i/g pk

i=1 hi and partly at the state  with the color charge q() = 2i/g pk

in the case of several clusters, the gluon vacuum is dened in a similar way. for example,

i=1 hi.

given two two-quark clusters, the construction

 =

1
4

[ (1+, 2+) + + (1, 2+) + + (1+, 2) +  (1, 2) ]

(8.3)

ensures the color-neutralness of both clusters. here, (11, 22) are vectors of hilbert space
associated with four solutions a given by eq. (6.5), j the sign of the color charge of the
jth quark, and 12 are arbitrary phase factors.

were a

 to be convertible to a+

 by a gauge transformation, any superposition of +
and  such as that of eqs. (8.2) or (8.3) would be forbidden from realization as a physical
state due to the availability of some superselection rule [28]. only the potential generated
by free quarks can be converted to the complex conjugate by a gauge transformation. there
is no such transformation for a generated by bound quarks, hence the superselection rule
does not occur, and every cluster remains color neutral.

we regard every k-quark cluster on the equal footing since the existence of multiquark
clusters was revealed experimentally [29]. it is well known, however, that hadrons are much
more stable than multiquark clusters. one may wonder what a plausible explanation of this
fact may be.

we can envision consecutive constructions of the ymw systems with the color spaces
sl(n, c), so(n, c), and sp(n, c). there is nothing to decide between these alternatives,
hence all should persist and interfere. is there the largest color cell outside of which three
pictures become quite dierent? such a sell does correspond to the three-quark case. for
n > 4, there are no isomorphisms between members of the series sl(n, c), so(2n  1, c),
sp(n, c), and so(2n, c). the interference of distinct color backgrounds is responsible for the
splitting of energetical levels, which leads to the decay of clusters. no interference occurs in
the single-quark case because sl(2, c)  so(3, c)  sp(1, c). in the two-quark and three-
quark cases, two alternatives interfere, respectively, sl(3, r) and so(3, 2)  sp(2, r), and
sp(3, r) and sl(4, r)  so(3, 3). thus clusters with two or three quarks are moderately
stable. the interference of three alternatives keeps multiquark clusters away from stability.
the color-neutralness of hadrons in the gauss law sense may well be compatible with
the observability of some specic color multiplet structure which reveals itself by innite-
dimensional unitary multiplets of sl(4, r). dothan, gell-mann, and neeman [30] suggested

30

that unitary multiplets of sl(3, r) are related to the regge trajectories of mesons. this
group is generated by the angular momentum operators li and the quadrupole operators
tij with the commutation relations

[li, lj] = iijk lk,

[li, tjk] = iijl tlk + iikl tjl,

[tij, tkl] = i (ikjlm + iljkm + jlikm) lm.

(8.4)

(8.5)

(8.6)

the algebra sl(3, r) represents the minimal scheme capable to explain two features of regge
trajectories: the j = 2 rule and the apparently innite sequence of hadronic states.

it was found in [30] that two innite unitary representations belonging to the ladder

thus the sl(3, r) scheme of dothan, gell-mann and neeman, being usefully applied to
the regge trajectories of mesons, turns out to be inadequate to account for those of baryons.
neeman and sijacki [10] assumed that matters can be improved by a simultaneous
application of sl(3, r) and so(1, 3). the commutation relations can be closed by embedding
two algebras in sl(4, r), a relativistic generalization of sl(3, r).

sl(4,r)(0, 1

with adopting this sl(4, r), one can classify the su(3)f octet states acording to the
sl(4,r)( 1
ddisc
2) representation while the symmetrized product of this reducible
representation and the nite-dimensional sl(4, r) representation ( 1
2) is used for the decu-
plet states. although this scheme is quite restrictive, it is in a good agreement with known
data of hadronic spectroscopy and predicts several new states [10]. the present exact solu-
tions show that the gauge symmetry of the background generated by clusters composed of
two or three quarks is just sl(4, r). 4

2, 1

4the isomorphism sl(4, c)  so(6, c) renders selected this gauge symmetry. indeed, if the con-
formal extension of minkowski space m # is to be mapped in a topologically nontrivial way into
the color space, then the color space sl(4, c) is favored over other images since it has a real form
sl(4, r)  so(3, 3) isomorphic to the conformal group of the pseudo-euclidean space e2,2.

31

a basis of sl(4, r) contains six antisymmetric elements m and nine symmetric elements
2 ijk mjk, ki = m0i, tij,

t, ,  = 1 . . . 3, which can be regrouped in the subsets: li = 1
ni = t0i, t00, satisfying the commutation relations (8.4)(8.6) together with

[ki, kj] = iijk kk,

[ni, nj] = iijk nk;

[li, kj] = iijk kk,

[li, nj] = iijk nk,

[ki, nj] = i (tij + ij t00);

[ki, tjk] = i(ij nk + ik nj),

[ni, tjk] = i(ij kk + ik kj),

[li, t00] = [tij, t00] = 0,

[ki, t00] = 2ini,

[ni, t00] = 2iki.

sl(4, r) is thus split into several subgroups: so(4) = so(3)  so(3) the maximal
compact subgroup generated by li and ni, so(1, 3) the lorentz group generated by li
and ki, sl(3, r) the three-volume-preserving group generated by li and tij, r+ the
noncompact abelian group generated by t00.

the subgroup so(4) is utilized as a basis with j p content of some (j1, j2) representation:

j p = (j1 + j2)p , (j1 + j2  1)p , . . . , (|j1  j2|)p .

the operator tij shifts so(4)-multiplets in (j1, j2) by j1,2 = 2 [see eq. (8.5)], and the
structure of regge sequences is reproduced by such shifting. a remarkable fact is that we
have arrived at hadrons with dierent total angular momenta j, including the half-integer.
however, in the present context, quarks have neither spin nor orbital momentum. in
the limit n  , we deal with bound quarks moving along straight world lines. where
did these higher angular momenta come from? we suppose them to be built out of gluon
degrees of freedom. indeed, m and t are related to our color basis as follows

mij  i(e+

ij  e

ij ), kj  i(e+

tij  i(e+

ij + e

tjj  2ihj.

(8.13)

(8.14)

(8.15)

it is conceivable that gluon excitations about the background with the sl(4, r) color sym-
metry can manifest themselves as if their color degrees of freedom were converted into spin
degrees of freedom described by irreducible unitary representations of so(1, 3).

a conversion of isospin into spin in gauge theories discovered in [12] seems to be of the
direct relevance to our discussion. this phenomenon has its origin in a combination of some

32

singular gauge eld of magnetic type, such as the magnetic eld generated by a monopole,
and an isospin-degenerate eld which is the source of a coulomb-like electric eld. the
lienard-wiechert term of the background is analogous to the eld of the magnetic monopole
while the components of excitations bij , i, j = 1, . . . , 3 with the asymptotical behavior
(7.16) play the role of the long-range electric eld. the rotation generators mij related to
e
ij by eq. (8.13) occur in the term of the angular momentum independent of the radius of
gyration.

unfortunately, this similarity is not quite complete. an external color eld with an ap-
propriate sl(4, r) degeneracy generating a long-range counterpart of the initial background
eld can hardly be conceived in the present context. on the other hand, restricting the
consideration to a pure ym system, one faces infrared divergences due to the excitations
bi4.
