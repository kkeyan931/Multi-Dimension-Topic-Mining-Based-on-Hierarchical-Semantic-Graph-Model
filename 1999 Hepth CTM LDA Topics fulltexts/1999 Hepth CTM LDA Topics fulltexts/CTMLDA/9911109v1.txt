abstract

two issues regarding the interactions of the chiral two-forms are presented. first, we study the
problem of constructing lorentz-invariant self-couplings of a single chiral two-form in the light of the
dirac-schwinger condition on the energy-momentum tensor commutation relations. we show how the
perry-schwarz condition follows from the dirac-schwinger criterion and point out that consistency
of the gravitational coupling is automatic. secondly, we study possible local deformations of chiral
two-forms. this reduces to the study of the local brst cohomological group at ghost number
zero. we proof that the only consistent deformations of a system of free chiral two-forms are (up to
redenitions) deformations that do not modify the abelian gauge symmetries of the free theory. the
consequence of this result for a system consisting of a number of parallel m5-branes is explained.

1 introduction

in the limit where bulk gravity decouples, the m5-brane is described by a six-dimensional eld theory. its
bosonic sector includes, besides the ve scalar elds which describe the position of the brane in transverse
space, a chiral two-form (i.e. a two-form the eld strength of which is self dual).

a single m5-brane with strong classical elds is well understood; its lagrangian is described in [1].
for a long time, the obstacle to get such an action was due to the presence of the chiral two-form. when
one tries to tries to incorporate the self-duality condition into an action a problem arises with preserving
lorentz invariance. there is a simple non-manifestly lorentz-invariant free lagrangian which has been
given in [2], and which generalizes the lagrangian of [3] for chiral bosons (the couplings to gravitation
are included). as a non linear generalization, a born-infeld-like action for for a self-interacting chiral
two-form was proposed in [4]. the couplings to gravitation were added in a second paper [5]. a manifestly
covariant formulation of chiral p-forms has been developed in an interesting series of papers [6]. this
formulation is characterized by the presence of an extra eld and an extra gauge invariance. this extra
eld occurs non-polynomially in the action, even for the free chiral p-forms. it has been shown to be
equivalent to the non-manifestly covariant treatment of [2] in minkowski space [1].

the question of lorentz-invariant self-couplings (as well as consistent self-couplings in an external
gravitational background) for a single chiral 2-form is the subject of the section 2. we show that this
question can be handled by means of the dirac-schwinger condition on the commutation relations of the
components of the energy-momentum tensor [7]. this condition leads directly to the dierential equation
obtained in [4] and implies automatically consistency of the gravitational coupling [8].

when several, say n, m5-branes coincide, little is known3. compactifying one dimension of m-theory
on a circle yields type iia string theory. if the branes are longitudinal to the compact direction, the
m5-branes appear as a set of coinciding d4-branes which are quite well understood. their dynamics is
governed by a ve-dimensional u (n) born-infeld theory which, ignoring higher derivative terms, is an
ordinary u (n) non-abelian gauge theory. turning back to the eleven dimensional picture, this suggests
that a non-abelian extension of the chiral two-form should exist.

deformations of a system of n free chiral two-forms in six dimensions are only considered (n is
expected to grow like n3). we ignore the fermions and the scalar elds as we believe that they will not

the conformal anomaly of the partition function [10] show that the theory should have n3 instead of n2 degrees of freedom.

modify our conclusions4. the analysis, outlined in the section 3, shows that all continuous and local
deformations of the free chiral 2-forms does not modify the gauge algebra which remains abelian [11].
as a consequence, no local eld theory continuously connected with the free theory can describe a system
of n coinciding m 5-branes. this does not exclude non-local deformations of the abelian theory or local
lagrangians that cannot be continuously deformed to the free one.

2 covariant self interactions of a single chiral 2-form

the non manifestly covariant action for a chiral 2-form in a gravitational background is

here, n and n k are the standard lapse and shift. the magnetic eld bij is a spatial tensor density of
weight one. in the absence of self-interactions, the energy density h is given by [2]

h =

g

bij bij

(4)

where the spatial indices are lowered and raised with the spatial metric and its ve-dimensional inverse,
while g is the determinant of gij. the energy density generates displacements normal to the slices of
constant x0. the momentum density hk, on the other hand, is purely kinematical and generates tangent
displacements. it is explicitly given by

hk =

ijmnkbij bmn.

in order to write the action (1), it is necessary to assume that spacetime has the product form t  
where t is the manifold of the time variable (usually a line). of course, a spatial coordinate could
equivalently play the role of the time variable, as in [4].

since bij is gauge-invariant and identically transverse (ibij = 0), the action (1) is manifestly
invariant under the usual gauge transformations aij = ij  ji. in at space, it is also invariant
under lorentz transformations, but these do not take the usual form [2].
we dene the exterior form b to be the (time-dependent) spatial 2-form with components bij /g.
the equations of motion that follow from the action are d[n (e  b)] = 0, where e is the electric spatial
2-form dened through

and where d is the spatial exterior derivative operator. in the case where the second betti number b2()
of the spatial sections vanishes, this equation implies n (e  b) = dm, where m is an arbitrary spatial
1-form. to bring this equation to a more familiar form, one sets mi = a0i. the equations of motion read
then f = f , where f0ij = aij  ia0j + ja0i. this is the standard self-duality condition. alternatively,
one may use the gauge freedom to set m = 0, which yields the self-duality condition in the temporal
gauge (e = b).

the brackets of the gauge-invariant magnetic elds bij can be found by follow the dirac method for
constrained systems [12] but one may shortcut the whole procedure and directly read the brackets from
the kinetic term of the action (1)

4 in fact this can easily be proven for the scalar elds because they are inert under the two-form gauge symmetry.

a direct calculation of the brackets of the energy densities h(x) at two dierent space points using

only the form of h and the brackets (7) yields

[h(x),h(x)] = (hk(x) + hk(x)),k (x  x).

(8)

now, we can ask ourselves how can we introduce interactions preserving lorentz invariance ? when
one can use the tensor calculus, it is rather easy to construct interactions that preserve lorentz invari-
ance5. but there is an alternative way to control lorentz invariance. it is through the commutation
relations of the energy-momentum tensor components. because the energy-momentum tensor is the
source of the gravitational eld, the method gives at little extra price a complete grasp on the gravita-
tional interactions. as shown by dirac and schwinger [7], a sucient condition for a manifestly rotation
and translation invariant theory (in space) to be also lorentz-invariant is that its energy density ful-
lls the commutation relations (8). the condition is necessary when one turns to gravitation [13]. the
method is more cumbersome than the tensor calculus when one can use the tensor calculus, but has the
advantage of being still available even when manifestly invariant methods do not exist.

in the dirac-schwinger approach, the question is to nd the most general h fullling (8). the
energy-density h must be a spatial scalar density in order to fulll the kinematical commutation relations
[h(x),hk(x)]  h(x),k (x  x) and depends on aij through bij in order to be gauge-invariant. in
ve dimensions, there are only two independent invariants that can be made out of bij , e.g.

set

y1 =

2g

bij bij, y2 =

4g2 bij bjkbkmbmi.

h = f (y1, y2)g, f1 = 1f, f2 = 2f.

then, the condition (8) yields to

which is precisely the equation found in [4]. the dirac-schwinger criterion yields thus directly the perry-
schwarz equation, whose solutions are investigated in [4, 14].

in the at space context (gij = ij , n = 1, n k = 0), the equation (8) guarantees that the interactions

this set of gauge transformations is reducible because if a

i = ia, the variation of aa

ij is 0.

our strategy for studying the possible local deformations of the action (12) is based on the observation
that these are in bijective correpondence with the local brst cohomological group h 0,6(s|d) [15], where

5these interactions should also preserve the number of (possibly deformed) gauge symmetries (if any), but this aspect

is rather immediate for p-form gauge symmetries - although it is less obvious for the extra gauge symmetry of [6].

order in g, in the sense that one can simultaneously deform the original gauge symmetry (14) in such
a way that the deformed action is invariant under the deformed gauge symmetry up to terms of order
g (included). the antield-dependent components of a contain informations about the deformation of
the gauge symmetry. trivial solutions of (21) are of the form a = c + de and correspond to a0s that
can be redened away through eld redenitions. of course, there are also consistency conditions on the
deformations arising from higher-order terms (g2 and higher), but it turns out that in the case at hand,
consistency to rst order already restricts dramatically the possibilities.

in general, there are three possible types of consistent deformations of the action. first, one may
deform the action without modifying the gauge symmetry.
in that case, a does not depend on the
antields, a = a0. these deformations contain only strictly gauge-invariant terms, i.e., polynomials in the
abelian curvatures and their derivatives (born-infeld terms are in this category) as well as chern-simons
terms, which are (o-shell) gauge-invariant under the abelian gauge symmetry up to a total derivative.
an example of a chern-simons term is given by the kinetic term of (12), which can be rewritten as
f  0a. 6 second, one may deform the action and the gauge transformations while keeping their algebra

invariant. in brst terms, the corresponding cocycles involve (non trivially) the antields aaij but
not c ai or a. finally, one may deform everything, including the gauge algebra; the corresponding
cocycles involve all the antields.

reformulating the problem of deforming the free action (12) in terms of brst cohomology enables one
to use the powerful tools of homological algebra. following the approach of [17, 18], we have completely
worked out the brst cohomogical classes at ghost number zero. in particular, we have established that
one can always get rid of the antields by adding trivial solutions (the complete proof will be given in
[19]). this result can be straightforwardly generalized for a system of chiral p-forms in 2p + 2 dimensions.
in other words, the only consistent local deformations of a system of free chiral p-forms are (up to
redenitions) deformations that do not modify the abelian gauge symmetries of the free theory. these
involve the abelian curvatures or chern-simons terms. there are no other consistent, local, deformations
(this completely justify the assumptions made for the dependence of h on the aij through the bij in
the section 2).
