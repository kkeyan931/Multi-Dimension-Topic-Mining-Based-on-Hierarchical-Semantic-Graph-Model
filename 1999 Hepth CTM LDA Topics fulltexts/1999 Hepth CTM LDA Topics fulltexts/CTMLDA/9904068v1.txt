abstract

we construct the anti-de sitter supergravity in three dimensions associated with the

supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). the eld content and the action are inferred using

the fact that ads supergravity theories in three dimensions are chern-simons theories.

introduction.

maldacenas ads/cf t correspondence [1] has spurred interest in anti-de sitter su-

pergravity theories. a particularly interesting case is the ads3/cf t2 correspondence
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. in this case string theory on ads3  s3  m4 with rr ux is conjectured

to be dual to the conformal theory of the higgs branch of the d1-d5-brane system, where
m4 can be t 4 or k3.

it is relevant to understand the corresponding supergravity on

ads3 for the investigation of this conjecture. on examining the symmetries of the near

horizon geometry of the d1-d5 system we nd that the specic ads3 supergravity is the

one associated with the supergroup g = su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). in this letter we will

construct the pure ( i.e. no coupling to matter ) anti-de sitter supergravity associated

with the above supergroup.

construction of this supergravity would be useful in furthering our understanding of

the boundary conformal eld theory. it is well known that gravity in ads3 is a chern-

simons theory with the gauge group sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) and it can be reformulated as

a liouville theory at the boundary [7]. a liouville theory corresponding to pure ads

supergravity associated with the supergroup g is likely to help us understand the space

time conformal eld theory constructed in [5] which is also a liouville theory. secondly,

construction of this supergravity can help us study backgrounds in ads3 other than the

pure ads3 and the bt z black hole, which are the backgrounds being studied presently.

these other backgrounds can help us understand certain properties of the boundary cft.

in fact the motivation for construction of this ads supergravity arose from the problem

of supersymmetrically embedding the conical spacetimes of [8] in this supergravity. these

spaces provide a one parameter family of metrics which interpolate between pure ads3

and the zero mass bt z black hole mimicking the spectral ow of the cft [9].

to construct the ads supergravity on g we use the fact that this theory is a chern-

simons theory associated with the supergroup g. that is, the action can be written

formally as

zm3

tr(d +

(1)

where  is the connection one-form for the supergroup and m3 is the three-dimensional
bosonic submanifold of the supergroup g with local coordinates x.  does not depend

2

on other coordinates of the group manifold [10]. using this one can x the eld content

using the generators of the supergroup. the equations of motion of the ads supergravity

on g will be the maurer-cartan equations of the supergroup which can be written down

from the corresponding superalgebra.

this letter is organized as follows.

in sec. 2 we write down the superalgebra on

g in a form suitable to extract the eld content of the ads supergravity and list the

maurer-cartan equations for the supergroup. in sec. 3 we present the action for the ads

supergravity on g. then we list down the supersymmetry transformation laws and show

that the action is invariant under them. in sec. 4 we state our conclusions.

2 the su (1, 1|2)  su (1, 1|2) superalgebra.

the su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) super algebra is the global part of the small n = (4, 4) super

conformal theory (see for e.g.

[4]). the bosonic generators consist of l, l+, l0 which
form the sl(2, r) part of the algebra and t i, t i which are the global su(2) currents. the

supercharges consist of g

1/2 which transform as fundamentals under
the global su(2) currents. we can organize the sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) generators into the

1/2, g

1/2, g

1/2, g

generators of lorentz transformations mab and translations pa of so(2, 2), the isometry

group of ads3. the supercharges of the each of the su(1, 1|2) transform as a dirac

fermion in ads3 with an internal su(2) index. then the su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) super

algebra is given by the following (anti) commutation relations.

[pa, pb] = 4m2mab

[pa, mbc] = abpc + acpb

(2)

[mab, mcd] = admbc  bcmad + acmbd + bdmac

[t i, t j] = 4iijkt k

[t i, t j] = 4iijkt k

[pa, g] = mag

[mab, g] =

[pa, g] = mag

[mab, g] =

our conventions are as follows. a, b, c . . . denote the tangent space indices of the ads

space. the tangent space metric has signature (1, 1, 1). i, j, k take values from 1 to 3

corresponding to the generators of su(2). the supercharges g and g are dirac fermions

in ads space which transform in the fundamental of the two su(2)s respectively. 1/m

refers to the radius of ads3 which is related to the cosmological constant. the  matrices

are given by

i denotes the pauli matrices and ,  denotes the su(2) indices. we dene ab =

(1/2)[a, b]. the following formulae are useful

ab = abcc,

123 = 1,

abcabc = 3!

to write the maurer-cartan equations we introduce the gauge eld one-forms

ab = dxab,

ea = dxea

ai = dxai

ai = dxai

associated with the generators mab, pa, g, g, t i, t i respectively. in other words

 = abm ab + eap a + g + g + g + g + ait i + ait i

(6)

thus the eld content of the su(1, 1|2)su(1, 1|2) supergravity consists of a vielbein ea,
two su(2) gauge elds ai

 transforming as the fundamental
of the two su(2)s. the gravitini are dirac fermions. ab is the spin connection. the

3 the action.

the maurer-cartan equations of the supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) written above

give the equations of motion of the supegravity we require. these equations can be

obtained as the euler-lagrange equations of the following action.

generalize the supersymmetry transformations for the non-abelian case. the rst equation

in (7) is the following constraint which denes ab

[ea] + ab[eb

( [a] +

(9)

this is also the equation of motion obtained by variation of the action in (8) by ab

treating the spin connection and the vielbein as independent elds. thus we use the

1.5 order formalism  in verifying the invariance of the action under supersymmetry

transformations. the supersymmetry transformations under which the action is invariant

are

here cc denotes complex conjugate. to verify these supersymmetry transformations it is

helpful to write the curvature and the cosmological constant term in the action (8) as

in course of the verication one arrives at the following typical four-fermion term

m

4 h( a )( a ) + ( i )( i )i

(11)

(12)

it can be shown that such terms cancel by means of a fierz indentity for non-commuting

fermions which is

(  )(  ) = 

1

2 h (  )(  ) + ( a )( a )i

(13)

the additional four-fermion cross-terms simply cancel.

4 conclusions.

in this letter we have constructed the anti-de sitter supergravity associated with the

supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). to construct it we used the fact that the action can

be written as the integral of the chern-simons three-form associated with the supergroup.

it is also important to note that this procedure of constructing ads supergravity can

be generalized to other three-dimensional ads supergroups for which the corresponding

supergravity has not yet been constructed. it would be interesting to couple this pure

supergravity to matter. that such a coupling should exist is clear from the fact that the

supergravity describing the near horizon geometry of the d1-d5 system contains matter

as well. this would give further understanding of the maldacena correspondence for this

case.
