abstract

we analyze the coulomb branch of matrix string theory in the presence of ns5-

branes. if we regard the components of u (1) gauge elds as the dualized longitudinal
coordinates, we obtain the symmetric product of ads3  s3  r4 as the geometry of
coulomb branch. we observe that the absence or presence of the nonzero electric ux

determines whether the string propagates in bulk as an ordinary closed string or is

forced to live near the boundary.

we further discuss the issues of the physical spectrum from the viewpoint of matrix

string theory. we show that the twisted sectors of cft on the symmetric orbifold,

which correspond to glued strings, turn out to yield many chiral primaries that were

hitherto considered to be missing. we also comment on the threshold energy in liou-

ville sector where continuous spectrum begins.

1 introduction

the theory of gravity or string theory on three-dimensional anti de-sitter space (ads3)

recently has been a topic of considerable interest. it has been understood for a long time

that the gravitational degrees of freedom in the bulk of ads3 may be described by a conformal

eld theory on the boundary. after maldacena presented the celebrated conjecture on the

duality between the gravity on the ads space and cft on its boundary[1], the case of ads3

achieved particular interest, as we know cft in two dimensions best. it may be possible to

prove the maldacenas conjecture in more detail in the case of ads3/cf t2. much work has

been done along this path[2][13].

in string theory, the ads3 space arises as the near-horizon geometry of the bound states

of d1/d5-branes. we take its s-dual and consider the string theory on an ns1/ns5-brane

background, in order to avoid the diculty in considering string theories on rr backgrounds.

the duality between string theory on ads3 and a certain boundary cft has been discussed

extensively. the generators of boundary superconformal algebras were directly constructed

out of vertex operators on the superstring worldsheet[2]. there have been attempts to study

the spectrum of chiral primaries and observe the correspondence to some extent[5, 7].

there have been further attempts to realize the boundary cft ward identities in which

the ads3 string theory was treated in a dierent way[6]. although there was some confusion

between these two approaches, some recent works[11, 12] put these concepts in order. now

it turns out that the string theory on ads3 has two distinct sectors corresponding to two

dierent congurations of the worldsheet. they are called as the short string sector and

the long string sector. the long strings are forced to live near the boundary with some

xed winding number, while the short strings can have arbitrary congurations of worldsheet

and are free to propagate in bulk. the two sectors lead to two dierent explanations for

the origin of the central charge of the boundary cft, as was discussed in [12]. the main

purpose of the present paper is to propose a unied framework including both the short and

long string sectors, based on matrix string theory[14].

one of the unresolved problems regarding the spectrum of chiral primaries is the mis-
match of its upper bound. in the string theory on ads space it is of order  k, where k is
the number of 5-branes. however, it is argued that the bound becomes of order  pk in the

1

boundary cft, where p is the number of 1-branes. as was stated in our previous paper[7],

it is natural to think that this discrepancy is due to the fact that we are only considering the

theory of a single string on ads3. we expect that the multi-string system based on matrix

string theory may solve this inconsistency. in this paper we show that this is indeed the

case.

this paper is organized as follows. we begin with the analysis of the coulomb branch of

matrix string theory in the presence of ns5-branes. we are then lead to the sigma model on

the moduli space of the coulomb branch, which is identied as the second quantized string
theory on ads3 s3  r4. twisted sectors of this orbifold cft correspond to glued strings,
which are strings made from some fundamental strings glued together.1 the long/short string

sectors are distinguished by the presence/absence of nonzero electric ux on the worldsheet.

we shall also discuss the spectrum of chiral primaries from the viewpoint of matrix

string theory, especially the issue of missing chiral primaries and the threshold for continuous

spectrum pointed out in [12].

throughout this paper we denote ns5-brane charge as k and ns1-brane charge as p,

following the convention of [2].

2 analysis of gauge theory

matrix string theory of type iia superstring[14] is dened as the large n limit of n = (8, 8)
u(n) sym theory in two dimensions. to incorporate k longitudinal ns5-branes extend-

ing along the 016789-directions, we add k hypermultiplets belonging to the fundamental
representation of u(n). in n = (4, 4) language the system consists of a u(n) vector mul-
tiplet and hypermultiplets belonging to one adjoint and k fundamental representations of

u(n). in the coulomb branch the gauge group is generically broken down to u(1)n . the

massless scalar elds parametrizing the moduli space are n abelian vectormultiplets, which

correspond to the string coordinates along the directions transverse to the ns5-branes (2345

1 hereafter we shall use the term glued string for strings which are made by gluing some fundamental

strings together. we will keep the term long string for dierent objects, which appear in [11, 12].

directions), and the n neutral hypermultiplets corresponding to the coordinates along 6789

directions. usually the 6789 directions are compactied on t 4 or k3. but in this article we

would like to ignore the subtleties concerning the compactication of matrix string theory

and focus mainly on the six-dimensional part.

one can obtain the exact metric of moduli space by one-loop analysis. this was done in

[15, 16] for the case of n = 1, and similar calculation works also in the case of generic n.
in n = (2, 2) terminology, an abelian vector multiplet consists of a chiral and a twisted-
chiral multiplets, (, ). we can write down the most generic action for these multiplets as
an integral of a function k(, , , ) over superspace[17]. the condition for k to give a
n = (4, 4) supersymmetric gauge theory of vectormultiplets is given by

ki j + ki j = 0 , ki j  kj i = 0

the metric and b eld on the target space are given by

ds2 = ki j did j  ki j did j
b = 

1
4

(kij didj  ki j did j  k ij d idj + k i j d id j)

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

taking spin(4) and permutation symmetry into account, we can conclude that the most

generic form for k is given by

ki

k = xi
ki = a(i i  i i) + b

(2.4)

ln i ln i z

i 
i
i i d


ln(1 + )


the terms with coecients a and b are tree and one-loop contributions, respectively, and we
can x them as a = 1

2g2 and b = k
4 .

we would like to note here that the one-loop contributions to the eective action arise

only from the fundamental hypermultiplets, so that the resultant contribution is proportional

to k. the one-loop contribution of adjoint elds cancel each other. this is to be expected,

because the system has a larger supersymmetry (with 16 supercharges) when the fundamental

hypermultiplets are absent.

the eective action has the following bosonic part

here yp
(i) and f(i) are the four scalars and the u(1) eld strength of the i-th abelian
vectormultiplet. b is some open three-dimensional space whose boundary is the worldsheet of
matrix string. in maldacenas near horizon limit or the weak coupling limit of iia superstring
s l2
theory, we send g2  g2
s to zero and drop the tree term from the action. then the metric
of the target space is no longer asymptotically at. the four-dimensional spatial directions
now have a tube metric, and we expect to obtain the ads3  s3 geometry by incorporating
the longitudinal directions. after changing the coordinates from yp
(i) to the radial coordinates

y(i) and the su(2) group elements, the action becomes

reads

y(i) = y(i) + i(i) +

f(i) .

note that the level of the bosonic part of swzw in (2.7) should be shifted to k 2 by means
of a chiral rotation so as to make the fermionic elds free, as was discussed in [16, 18, 19].

hence the level of the total current, including the fermionic contribution, should remain k.

3 short strings and long strings

various interesting phenomena occur when we compactify the spatial direction on s1. al-

though the gauge eld in two dimensions has no dynamics, it carries some topological infor-

mations, according to which we can classify the sectors of matrix string theory.

4

various sectors can be labeled by the periodicity conditions along s1. as was explained

in the original papers on matrix string theory[14], we can twist the periodicity of elds which

take values in the cartan subgroup of u(n) by elements of the weyl group, namely, the n-th

permutation group. the twisted sectors are pictorially understood as glued strings, or some

strings mutually glued together into a single string. for example, there is a sector which is

labeled by the n-th cyclic permutation. this sector is interpreted as the sector where n

fundamental strings are joined together to form a glued string. as we shall explain later,

the glued strings constructed in this way are accountable for the missing chiral primaries.

another interesting phenomenon is the presence of nonzero u(1) electric ux. in the at

background with no ns5-brane charge, this ux describes the existence of d0-branes[14],

and in the t-dualized framework it describes the (p, q)-string sectors[20, 21]. however, as

our discussion below is based on the eective action (2.7), the presence of electric ux may

have a dierent interpretation. we shall show below that the string becomes long if there

is nonzero electric ux on its worldsheet.

to simplify the problem, we focus on the case of a single string (the case n = 1) for the

time being. to see the implication of nonzero electric ux, let us write down the relevant

terms in the eective action below;

s = 

k

4 z

d2x (cid:18) +

1
2

e2f f(cid:19) + . . .

(3.1)

here the liouville eld  is dened as y = e and the worldsheet  is a cylinder or the two-

punctured sphere. we can quantize the system canonically in the a0 = 0 gauge. the only

dynamical variable is the wilson line u = exp(cid:18)i a1 dx(cid:19). (u)  u n is the eigenfunction
of the electric eld strength   e2e, which is the canonical conjugate of the wilson line.
note that the eigenvalue is quantized due to the periodicity of the wilson line. when there

is nonzero electric ux, it yields the following contribution to the eective action (here we

move to the euclidean signature):

s  z

d2x e20n2 ,

n  z

(3.2)

to minimize the action, we must have 0   (or y = 0) if there is nonzero electric ux.
on the contrary, 0 is arbitrary if there is no electric ux. hence we come to the conclusion

that the string is forced to live near the source ns5-branes if there is nonzero electric ux

on the worldsheet.

5

in the present situation, the ns5-branes are located at the origin, y = 0. if we t-dualize
the system, the parametrization of the radial direction is reversed, namely, y = 0 and y = 
are interchanged.

we would like to see the correspondence between the eective action of matrix string
theory and the action of superstring on ads3  s3 in some detail. to do this, we shall rst
move to the euclidean worldsheet. as was obtained in the previous section, the eective

eld theory has the following liouville part,

s =

(3.3)
where  = 2k up to a constant shift. to ensure the conformal invariance, we must add
the background charge term,

1

8 z

d2x(cid:18)  + e 2

k ff(cid:19) ,

q

8 z

r(2),

to the above action. the background charge q must be determined such that the term

k ff has the correct conformal dimension. then the eective action is given by

e 2

s =

this theory has the central charge

(3.5)

below we show that one must choose q dierently for long and short strings. the observation

of [12] that the cft on the short and long strings describe respectively the coulomb branch

and the higgs branch near the small instanton singularity.

1. short string (n = 0)

in this sector it is appropriate to assign the canonical dimension 0 to the gauge eld a.

the background charge is xed by this condition as q = q 2

c = 12.

k . the central charge becomes

it is easy to see the correspondence of this cft and the world-sheet theory of short string

on ads3 background. the worldsheet action of a fundamental string on ads3 is given by

(3.6)

(3.7)

or equivalently, by introducing the auxiliary elds  and  we have;

s =

1

8 z

k   +   + (cid:19) .

the short string theory on ads3 is dened on an arbitrary compact riemann surface, because

it should describe arbitrary propagation and interaction of closed strings in bulk. the (, )-

system should have the conformal dimensions (1, 0) as in wakimoto representation[23]. from

these facts we see the operator h 1 cannot take nonzero classical value. the rns
superstring action on ads3 background is obtained as the supersymmetric extension of the
above action. in quantizing the system, we can choose the light-cone gauge   z, + = 0 (z
is a holomorphic coordinate on  and + is the fermionic coordinate along the longitudinal

direction) of [8, 12] and eliminate the longitudinal degrees of freedom. after this gauge

xing, we nd that the cft of the transversal degrees of freedom coincides with the one we

have obtained from the gauge theory analysis, including the value of the background charge

of the liouville part.

here we make an important remark. the gauge condition   z is quite dierent from
the nonzero classical value of i 1. one must not confuse these two distinct notions. if

we impose the light-cone gauge condition on a string theory dened on a generic riemann

surface, we should impose it on each of the local coordinate patches. even in at background

the light-cone gauge cannot be imposed globally unless we take a cylindrical worldsheet.

2. long string (n 6= 0)
as we have seen above, in the case of n 6= 0, the worldsheet of the string must be near
the ns5-branes, y  0. the nonzero electric ux   e 2
k e also indicates that the gauge
eld az and az should have the geometric dimension (1, 0) and (0, 1), and the operator
e 2
k  should have the conformal weight (1,1). this leads to the liouville background
charge q = 2k s 2

. the central charge now becomes c = 6k.

k

this sector is identical to the cft on the long string in the light-cone gauge, which is

discussed in [8, 12]. as was discussed in these papers, we can bosonize the eight free fermions

in this theory to dene eight spin elds, which are fermions in the sense of the worldsheet

7

as well. using these spin elds we can construct a n = (4, 4) superconformal algebra with
c = 6k. it is the sum of the two superconformal algebras arising from the r4 part and the
remaining part, with c = 6 and c = 6(k  1), respectively.

now we would like to compare our cft with the cft on the long string worldsheet.

recall that matrix string theory describes the iia strings and the (short or long) strings on
ads3 s3 are the objects in iib string theory. so as to make a comparison we have to apply
t-duality to the two-dimensional eld theory.

let us start from iib side. the relevant part of the world-sheet action is given by (3.6),

which we rewrite with  = 0 + i1. of course 0, 1 are the time and spatial coordinates

parameterizing the boundary of euclidean ads3. we can partially gauge-x the conformal
symmetry by the condition 0 = t, and obtain

s =

1

8 z

d2x(cid:26)  + e 2

k (cid:16)(t1)2 + (x1)2 + 2x1(cid:17)(cid:27) ,

(3.8)

we can t-dualize this action according to the standard procedure(see, for example, [24]),
with respect to the u(1) isometry 1  1 + 

s =

8 z

d2x(cid:26)  + e 2

k (cid:16)(t1)2 + (x1)2(cid:17) + 2it1(cid:27) ,

(3.9)

where 1 denotes the dual coordinate of 1.

on the other hand, our eective action of matrix string theory(3.3) can be rewritten, if

a suitable source term ensuring nonzero electric ux on the worldsheet is added, as follows;

s =

=

1

8 z
8 z

d2x(cid:26)  + e 2
d2x(cid:26)  + e 2

(cid:16)(ta1)2 + (xa1)2(cid:17) + 2ita1(cid:27)

k

a1dx(cid:19)

(3.10)

where we have chosen the a0 = 0 gauge, and added a gauge-xing term with respect to

the residual gauge symmetry. action (3.10) is clearly the same as (3.9) if we make the
identication 1 = a1.

some comments are in order. first of all, long strings have nonzero winding number

hi 1di = 1, which implies that  should be of conformal dimension 1. this assignment
of conformal weight forces us to impose the condition   z globally. this is possible only
when the worldsheet is cylindrical. hence long strings must have cylindrical worldsheets, as

8

was mentioned previously. note also that this assignment of conformal weight is consistent

with the interpretation that  and a are dual to each other.

moreover, the term  2e 2

k x in (3.8) plays the role of source term for the winding
number of , while the corresponding term  2ita1 in the dual action (3.10) is no other
than the source term for the electric eld   e 2
k e. therefore we can say that the

nonzero winding number of  in iib theory side precisely corresponds to nonzero electric

ux in the iia matrix string theory side.

in the above argument we can see explicitly, as stated previously, the interchange of y = 0
and y =  under the t-duality transformation. hence a long string, which is forced to live
near y  0 in iia picture, is at y  + in iib picture.

the argument given above was based on a proposal of [22] that we should assign the

canonical dimension 0 to the gauge eld a in the coulomb branch cft, while we should

assign the geometrical dimension 1 in the higgs branch. although originally we have been

analyzing the coulomb branch, the nonzero electric ux requires the redenition of the

conformal dimension of the gauge eld, which then leads us to the physics of the higgs branch.

at the same time the object becomes a long string, whose dynamics suitably describes the

higgs branch cft near the small instanton singularity, as was discussed in [12].

4 twisted sectors

matrix string theory contains various sectors in which some fundamental strings are glued

together. the eld contents on the worldsheet of glued strings are the same as those of a

single string, so we can determine whether a glued string is long or short in the same way

as with a single string. a generic sector of matrix string theory corresponds to a set of

glued strings, each of which has an arbitrary length. some of them are long, i.e. there is

nonzero electric ux on their worldsheet. the sum of the length of the long strings is the

ns1-brane charge p, which is xed. by the argument of the charge conservation, two strings

can be glued together only when there is equal electric ux on the two worldsheets[21].

in particular, a long string and a short string cannot be glued together. then we are led
to the following conformal eld theory for this system: symn p(mshort)  symp(mlong),
where mshort(mlong) stands for the theory of a single short(long) string, as described in the

9

previous section. here we mean by symn (m) the n-th symmetric product of a conformal
eld theory m. this operation is dened in a similar manner as the sigma model on a
symmetric orbifold mn /sn is dened from the sigma model on m.

matrix string theory contains various twisted sectors describing many glued strings. so

we expect that all of the connected and disconnected worldsheets having arbitrary genera

can be reproduced in the large n-limit. moreover, we further expect that the integration

over the moduli of the worldsheets corresponds precisely to the large n limit of matrix string

theory. this was conjectured in [14], and more detailed analyses were given in [25] based

on the interpretation of the bps instantons in matrix string theory as several plane curves.

although the analyses of [25] were done in the at background, this remarkable claim may

be true even in the presence of ns5-branes. in this way we might be able to recover the full
second quantized iib superstring theory on ads3  s3  r4 for the short string sector in
the large n-limit.

how about the long string sector? since the ns1-brane charge p is xed, we have at

most p-glued long string sector. this means that we cannot consider a worldsheet of a long

string with arbitrarily large genus (although we assume p >> 1). furthermore the moduli of

the worldsheet should be frozen, because the worldsheet of a long string must be cylindrical,

lying near the boundary of ads3 in the iib picture. therefore it is more appropriate to

regard the cft of the long string sector as the boundary cft itself, rather than the theory

of gravity or string theory in bulk ads3.

in our previous paper[7] we treated the rst quantized rns superstring on ads3s3t 4
with the covariant formalism. we constructed a brst invariant state that corresponds to

the vacuum of the spacetime scft for the case of p = 1. as for p > 1 no such state was

found. that observation ts nicely with the results obtained in this paper.

we can see that if there were a single string carrying a winding charge greater than 1,

it would lead to an inconsistency. in fact, the assumption hi 1di = p or   zp implies
that (, ) have conformal weights (p + 1,p), hence we have to improve the stress tensor
as follows:

ttotal = tworldsheet + pj 3.

(4.1)

this stress tensor would give rise to the central charge c = 6kp2, if the worldsheet theory

were originally a critical string theory. hence this naive argument cannot explain the correct

10

central charge unless |p| = 1.

in addition, our previous arguments have shown that the shift in the conformal weight

of the gauge eld, a, due to the electric ux is always 1, no matter how large the ux is. in
the iib picture the conformal weight of  is always 1 when there is a nonzero electric ux
in iia picture, regardless of how large it is. so the winding number of a single long string is

always 1.

so, the winding charge p > 1 must be carried by some glued long strings. they must be
composed of precisely p single long strings, which leads to the cft of symp(mlong) with
the correct central charge c = 6kp. we believe that the matrix string theory is the most

natural framework to explain why such an orbifold cft arises.

5 spectrum in the long string sector

in this section we discuss the spectrum of chiral primaries in the long string sector. as was
given in the previous section, the cft of the long string sector is given by symp(mlong),
where mlong is the cft of a single long string. mlong is the product of three cfts,
namely, a super liouville theory with q = 2k  s 2
, an swzw theory with level k

and the superconformal sigma model on m 4.2 the cft on m 4 and the remaining part
have n = (4, 4) superconformal algebras with the central charge c = 6 and c = 6(k  1),
respectively. according to this product structure, any chiral primary of mlong can be written
as the product of a chiral primary of m 4 part and the chiral primary of the remaining part.

k

we denote them as follows:

o(, l) = o ol,

(  h (m 4), l = 0, . . . , k  2).

(5.1)

here o is one of the chiral primaries of the m 4 part. they are labeled by the cohomology
element, , of m 4. ol is a chiral primary of the remaining part, which has the following

2 previously we assumed that m 4 = r4.

in this section we shall somehow generalize the situation

and consider m 4 as one of r4, t 4 or k3. of course, as we have mentioned previously, if we consider the

generalization for the choice of the internal manifold at the stage of matrix string theory, there must arise

the subtleties concerning the compactication of matrix theory on higher-dimensional torus. but in this

section we shall forget these diculties and simply replace r4 by t 4 or k3.

ni = p). the sector

xi=1

other words it can be regarded as composed of s glued strings of length (n1, . . . , ns). if we

are interested in single particle states, we only have to consider the zm-twisted sector, or

the sector of a single glued string of length m.

the superconformal algebra (sca) suitably acting on the hilbert space of the zm-twisted

sector is constructed in the following manner (see for example [27]): first we make up the

sca nl

n, ga

n , k 

n o of the glued string variables as in the case of the single long string

12

mlong with c = 6k. second, we must mod out by zm-action, and get the desired sca a with
c = 6mk. more explicitly, we should dene the superconformal generators (in the ramond

sector) for the zm-twisted sector as follows3

in this expression for ln the second term of the rhs corresponds to the contribution from
the schwarzian derivative of the covering map w = zm.

we can now present the complete spectrum of chiral primaries for the zm-twisted sector.

the ramond vacua in this sector should have the same spectrum of weight and r-charge as

those in the cft of a single long string:

l
0|, l; (m)i =
l
0|, l; (m)i =

hence, by the denitions(5.7) we obtain the following relations:

finally we translate the above relations in the ramond sector to those in ns sector by means
of the spectral ow. as a result, the chiral primaries in zm-twisted sector o(, l; (m)) have
the following quantum numbers:

h = j =

q() + l + k(m  1)

2

,

h = j =

q() + l + k(m  1)

2

(5.10)

(l = 0,   , k  2, m = 1,   , p)

3 the situation becomes more complicated for the sca of ns sector, since we must dene them separately

according to whether m is even or odd. this is the main reason why here we work in the ramond sector

and make use of the spectral ow instead of dealing with the ns sector directly.

13

in this way we can reproduce almost all the chiral primaries of single particle type that are

expected from the correspondence with the scft on sympk(m 4),except for the absence of

the following sequence of states:

h = j =

q() + km  1

2

,

h = j =

q() + km  1

2

(m = 1,   , p).

(5.11)

notice that the case m = 1 in (5.11) is no other than the rst missing state discussed in

[12]. there it was discussed that the absence of this state is related to the small-instanton

singularity of the moduli space of d1/d5-brane bound states. we nd its cousins in the zm-

twisted sectors m > 1. although we still have the missing states in the framework of matrix

string theory, there are not too many of them. especially, the bound for the r-charge

spectrum appears above the threshold conformal weight, 0 =

4k

, which would



make the counting of the chiral primaries above the threshold dicult. this result is based

on the study of liouville theory[28], in which it is claimed that we have two dierent types

of states in quantum liouville theory: one of them is a non-normalizable state which form a

discrete spectrum, and the other is a normalizable state which form a continuous spectrum.
the latter appears above the threshold, 0 
liouville theory. here we shall show that the threshold value also becomes p-times larger
when we consider the cft of p long strings, symp(mlong).

, where q is the background charge of

q2
8

it is easy to see this in the untwisted sector. we only have to nd the normalizable state
with the smallest conformal weight in this sector. obviously this state has the form |0ip,
where |0i is the normalizable state with the lowest energy in the single long string theory:

l0|0i 

k
4|0i.

(5.12)

therefore the threshold for the untwisted sector is equal to 0 

pk

.

in order to calculate the threshold value for general twisted sectors we have to recall the

denition of the virasoro operator in the zm-twisted sector(5.7). then the threshold for the

zm-twisted sector becomes:

sectors characterized by arbitrary young tableaus (n1, . . . , ns)  yp:

(5.14)

we make one comment. it is known that the spectrum of chiral primaries in sympk(m 4)

sigma model agrees with that of supergravity below the bound 
proved in the case of m 4 = k3 by analyzing the elliptic genus[29], and more recently it

. this claim was rst

has been proved in the case of m 4 = t 4 by analyzing the new susy index[30]. the

value of the upper bound is the same,

pk
4

. although apparently the origins of the bound

are dierent between the analyses of [29, 30] and ours, there might be some relationship
between the two. this is because supergravity on an ads3  s3  m 4 background has only
the discrete spectrum, so that the emergence of continuous spectrum may lead to a failure

in the correspondence between the description of supergravity and the boundary scft.

6 conclusions and discussions

in this paper we studied the multi-string system on ads3 s3 m 4 in the framework of ma-
trix string theory. among other things, we have successfully presented a unied framework

of the various short and long string sectors. although gauge eld in two dimensions has no

local physical degrees of freedom, it plays an extremely important role, namely, the vev of

electric eld on the worldsheet distinguishes between the short and long string sectors.

now we would like to mention some questions which could be discussed in future works.

in section 3 we have shown the t-duality between the matrix string action and the
ads3  s3 string action, as far as their bosonic parts are concerned. it would be interesting
to investigate further and see the full t-duality. of course, some fermions are missing on

the gauge-theory side (which would correspond to the superpartner of bosonic sl(2, r)

currents on the superstring theory.) perhaps this aspect will be better understood when we

come to a deeper understanding of the relation between the u(1) gauge symmetry of matrix

string theory and the reparametrization invariance of the superstring theory. to this aim

15

the formulation of matrix theory in a manifestly covariant manner may be useful. some

approaches to this subject were given in [31].

in section 5 we discussed the problem of the missing chiral primaries by the analysis of

the cft of p long strings. although we still have some states missing, as was pointed out in

[12], the correspondence with the sympk(m 4) sigma model is not too bad. in particular,
by taking account of the various glued strings we have reproduced the bound 
precisely the same as is expected from the analysis of the sympk(m 4) sigma model.

which is

however, there seems to be a further subtlety regarding the spectrum of the multi-

particle chiral primaries, for our construction seems to yield the spectrum interpretable as

the cohomology of symp(symk(m 4)), not of sympk(m 4). in other words there should be

an u-duality transformation which changes the value of k and p, while preserving their

product. at present it is not clear whether our construction in the framework of matrix

string theory has this duality symmetry. in any case, we will need further study to get a

complete understanding of this issue.

the problem of the threshold for the continuous spectrum is also interesting. we have
kp
4

shown that our analysis of the cft of p long strings yields a threshold p-times larger, 
this is the same as the threshold obtained in [29, 30].

it was discussed there that the

.

correspondence between the supergravity in bulk and the boundary scft fails above this

threshold. perhaps it may be interesting to study the relation between this issue and the

physics of three-dimensional black holes, as the above threshold coincides with the energy

at which the rst excited btz black hole (the massless btz black-hole) appears.
