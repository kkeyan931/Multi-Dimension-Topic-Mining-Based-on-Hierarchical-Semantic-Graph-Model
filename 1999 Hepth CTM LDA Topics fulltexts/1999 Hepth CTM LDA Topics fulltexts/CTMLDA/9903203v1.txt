abstract

we discuss various approaches to extracting the full stress-energy tensor of the conformal eld
theory from the corresponding supergravity solutions, within the framework of the maldacena
conjecture. this provides a more rened probe of the ads/cft correspondence. we apply
these techniques in considering the casimir energy of the conformal eld theory on a torus. it
seems that either generically the corresponding supergravity solutions are singular (i.e., involve
regions of large string-scale curvatures), or that they are largely insensitive to the boundary
conditions of the cft on the torus.

1 introduction

the maldacena conjecture [1] has brought a renewed interest in the holographic principle[2],
which asserts that a theory of gravity in d dimensions can be described in terms of a nongrav-
itational theory in d  1 dimensions. the current activity in string theory is focused on the
ads/cft correspondence [3], which implements holography with a duality between a gravi-
tational theory in d-dimensional anti-de sitter space and a conformal eld theory living in a
(d1)-dimensional boundary space. this context is best understood for a specic superstring
example with d = 5 [1, 3, 4]. in this case, the duality maintains an equivalence between type
iib superstring theory on ads5  s5, and n = 4 super-yang-mills theory with gauge group
u(n) in four dimensions. further in many interesting cases, it is sucient to only consider the
low energy limit of the superstring theory, namely, supergravity.

a precise formulation of the ads/cft correspondence is made in equating the generating
function of the connected correlation functions in the cft with the string/gravity partition
function on the ads space[3, 4]. in the approximation of classical (super)gravity,

zads(i) = ei(i) =der 0,ioiecf t

(1)

where i(i) is the classical (super)gravity action as a functional of the supergravity elds, 0,i
are the asymptotic boundary values of the bulk elds i up to a certain rescaling [3], and oi
are the dual cft operators. treating the boundary elds 0,i as source currents in the cft,
eq. (1) is used in calculating the correlation functions of the operators oi. this framework also
naturally allows one to evaluate the expectation values of the cft operators in terms of the
asymptotic (super)gravity elds [5, 6].

given that part of the duality is a theory of gravity in ads space, one of the bulk elds
will always be the graviton. so it is natural to ask what the role of the graviton (or metric
perturbations) are in the above construction. the appropriate current-source term in the
ads/cft generating function (1) couples the ads graviton to the stress-energy tensor of the
cft [7, 8],

this coupling has been used to investigate two- and three-point correlation functions of the
stress tensor[9, 10]. in particular, considering correlations protected by supersymmetry pro-
vides a nontrivial consistency test of the duality between iib supergravity on ads5 and four-
dimensional super-yang-mills theory [8].

just as in asymptotically at space, the energy of an asymptotically ads solution can be
determined by the asymptotic behavior of the metric [11, 12]. in the context of the ads/cft
correspondence, this result has the additional interpretation that the asymptotic metric per-
turbations determine the energy of the corresponding cft state (or ensemble of states). this
element of the correspondence was examined in ref. [13], where it lead to the conjecture of
a new positive energy theorem for general relativity. in the eld theory, the energy is given

by e = rhttti, and so as in the general discussion above, one is considering states for which

the expectation value of a particular operator, i.e., the stress-energy tensor, is nonvanishing.
in fact, the expectation value of all of the individual components of the stress-energy can be
determined from the asymptotic metric, and this is the focus of the present paper. having

the entire stress tensor provides a more rened tool with which to investigate the ads/cft
correspondence, and we will apply it in order to extend the investigation of casimir energies
initiated in ref. [13].

the remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we consider in detail various
techniques for calculating the expectation value of stress-energy tensor in the cft from the
corresponding supergravity solutions. in section 3, we apply these techniques to examine the
casimir energy of the cft on a toroidal geometry. finally, we present a discussion of our
results in section 4.

while this paper was in preparation, ref. [14] appeared which discusses calculating the cft

stress-energy using techniques similar to those in section 2.2.

2 stress-energy tensor

as discussed above, the stress-energy tensor provides an interesting tool with which to study
the ads/cft correspondence.
in the following, we consider three dierent approaches to
extracting the eld theory stress tensor from the supergravity solutions via: (i) asymptotically
at p-brane geometries, (ii) the quasilocal energy dened by brown and york [21] and (iii) an
expansion of the asymptotic metric with an appropriate choice of coordinates.

2.1 asymptotically flat geometries

the maldacena conjecture [1] originally emerged out of investigations of extended branes in
string theory and m theory. anti-de sitter space arises as part of the near-horizon geometry of
certain branes, e.g., ads4,5,7 for m2-, d3- and m5-branes, respectively [1, 15]. so we begin by
considering the supergravity solutions describing a near-extremal p-brane in a d-dimensional,
asymptotically at spacetime. the usual formula giving the mass of a point-like object in
terms of the asymptotic metric can be extended to give the mass per unit p-volume of such
solutions[16]. a simple derivation of this result begins by considering an extended p-dimensional
source in the linearized gravity equations.
if we assume that the brane directions are also
symmetry directions, these results may be further extended to yield the entire stress-energy
tensor for the p-brane world-volume:

tab =

16gdi ddp2rdp2 nihab(cid:16)ihc

c + ihj

j  jhj

i(cid:17)  ihabi

(3)

where ni is a radial unit vector in the transverse subspace, while h = g  is the deviation
of the (einstein frame) metric from that for at space. note that h is not a dieomorphism
invariant quantity, and in applying eq. (3), it must be calculated using asymptotically cartesian
coordinates. above, the labels a, b = 0, 1, . . . , p run over the world-volume directions, while
i, j = 1, . . . , d  p  1 denote the transverse directions. for a = b = 0, eq. (3) reduces to the
standard formula for the mass density of the p-brane[16].

as an application of this formula, let us consider a near-extremal d3-brane for which the

2

10-dimensional spacetime metric is[17]

ds2 = h 1/2(f 2 dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2) + h 1/2  dr2
with h = 1 +  
r!4

r(cid:19)4
and f 2 = 1 (cid:18)

f 2 + r2d5!

(4)

while we x the constant background dilaton as e = 1. as mentioned above, to apply eq. (3),
we need to express the metric in isotropic coordinates, at least asymptotically. that is we need
to nd a new radial coordinate such that dr/f = f (r) dr and r = f (r) r. the nal result is
that asymptotically

r  r 1 +

8r4!

(5)

so that we may write the metric as

with r2 = p6

yields

ds2  h(r)1/2(f (r)2 dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2) + h(r)1/2f (r)2(dxi)2
i=1(xi)2. given this form of the metric, a straightforward calculation of eq. (3)

now this stress tensor may be regarded as including two contributions: (i) those appearing
with the introduction of the extremal d3-brane and (ii) those due to excitations of the d3-
brane above extremality, and hence which vanish as   0. the precise nature of these
sources can be understood by expanding the born-infeld action [7, 8, 18], or by studying
string scattering from d-branes [19].
in the context of the maldacena conjecture, we are
primarily interested in the latter since they represent the contribution to the stress-energy tensor
by excitations in the world-volume eld theory. to isolate these contributions, we subtract
o the extremal contribution but in doing so we must be careful to subtract o that for an
extremal d3-brane with the same rr ve-form charge as the solution (4) given above. thus the
appropriate extremal stress tensor is found by rst setting  = 0 in eq. (7) and then replacing
4  2(4 + 4)1/2. it is most interesting to make the subtraction in the limit1 that / << 1
which yields

this result has a form characteristic of a thermal gas of massless particles. in particular its
trace vanishes, i.e., t a
a = ab tab = 0. this is in keeping with the interpretation that this
contribution arises from a thermal gas in the super yang-mills theory on the world-volume of
the d3-brane.

1this corresponds to the decoupling limit[1] in which s  0 while holding /2

s and /s xed.

repeating the calculations for near-extremal m5- and m2-branes yields an analogous tab
which is again isotropic and traceless. hence, this stress-energy lends itself to the interpretation
of being due to a thermal gas of massless particles on the world-volume of these nondilatonic
branes as well.
in the case of a general dp-brane, however, the result is isotropic but not
a  (p3)2 indicating the distinguished position of the d3-brane amongst
traceless. rather t a
the dirichlet branes. of course, an essential dierence is that for the generic dp-brane the
dilaton is no longer constant. in such a situation, there is an intrinsic ambiguity in the denition
of the energy (see, e.g., [20]) and so one could with an appropriate conformal transformation
nd a metric for which eq. (3) yields a traceless stress tensor.

2.2 quasilocal formulation

as discussed above in a more general setting, the ads/cft correspondence describes a duality
between gravity in ads spacetimes and a boundary eld theory. for any theory including
einstein gravity coupled to matter elds, the boundary stress-energy tensor may be dened
as follows [21]2: consider spacetime manifold m with time-like boundary m.3 denote the
spacetime metric as g, and n is the outward-pointing normal to m normalized with nn =
1. the induced metric on the boundary,  = g  nn, acts as a projection tensor onto
n. now given the standard
m. the extrinsic curvature on m is given by  = 
einstein action including a boundary term

(10)

where a, b, c denote directions parallel to the boundary. for a background solving the equations
of motion, this stress tensor will satisfy[21]

da ab = t nb

(11)

where the source on the right-hand side is a projection of the matter stress-energy, t nb =
nt 
b, and da is the covariant derivative projected onto m. eq. (11) expresses the local
conservation of the boundary stress-energy up to the ow of matter energy-momentum across
the boundary into m. due to the geometric connement in asymptotically ads spacetimes,
this source term will vanish in the following.

in the case of interest here, the boundary will be an asymptotic surface at some large
radius r. a technical problem with the above denitions for the action and the surface stress
tensor is that they will both diverge in the limit r  . this problem can be cured [12] for
the action by subtracting the same contribution (9) for a reference background geometry for

2brown and yorks quasilocal stress tensor [21] was rst considered in the context of the ads/cft corre-

spondence in ref. [14].

3in general in a minkowski-signature spacetime, one would expect the boundary to include space-like com-

ponents as well, but in the present context, these components will not play a role

(12)

now consider the case that the spacetime has a killing vector  which is asymptotically
time-like and surface forming, and also that m is chosen so that the killing vector remains
an isometry of the boundary, i.e., d(ab) = 0. in this situation, one can show [21] that

e() =ib

dd2x aabb

(13)

with b, a hypersurface in m orthogonal to a, is a conserved charge. if the boundary contains
other spacelike killing vectors, the latter can also be used to dene other conserved charges by
replacing one of the factors of  by a new killing vector in eq. (13). further with the choice that
the norm aa = 1 on the boundary, e() coincides precisely with the standard denition of
the energy[21, 12].

as the supergravity energy should match the total energy measured in the eld theory, this
denition (13) is useful in the last step required in matching the surface stress tensor (12) with
the expectation value of the stress energy in the dual cft. while the charge in eq. (13) is nite

for asymptotically ads spacetimes, the measure  is actually asymptotically divergent.

in this situation, eq. (13) only yields a nite result because the components of ab vanish
asymptotically. in the ads/cft duality, the asymptotic boundary geometry is related to the
background geometry on which the dual eld theory lives by a conformal transformation which
also diverges asymptotically. this conformal transformation can be accounted for by writing
the stress tensor expectation value in the eld theory as follows:

hhabhtbci = lim

r

abbc

(14)

where hab is the background metric of the eld theory.

at this point, it may be useful to examine an explicit example in which to apply the
above analysis. hence consider the spherically symmetric schwarzschild-ads metric in d=p+2
dimensions

ds2 = f (r)2dt2 + f (r)2dr2 + r2dp

2 rp1 .

r2

with f (r)2 =

(15)

(we have chosen a slightly unusual normalization for the mass term to facilitate comparisons
with the results for the planar black holes below.) the normal vector to the surface r = r is

and so the nonvanishing components of the boundary metric are

n = f (r)
r

00 = f (r)2

ab = r2 [(p)]ab

5

(16)

(17)

where a and b denote angular directions, and [(p)]ab is the metric on a unit p-sphere. in this
simple situation, the extrinsic curvature reduces to

ab = nrr

ab =

nrrgab

and with a straightforward calculation, eq. (10) yields

tt =

ab =

[(p)]ab p

(18)

(19)

with this result, we see that the nonvanishing components of the boundary stress tensor are
all diverging as r2 as r  , making clear the necessity of the background subtraction in
eq. (12). in the present case, the natural background geometry is simply eq. (15) with  = 0,
which corresponds to adsp+2. in matching the boundaries, care must be taken to scale the
time coordinate in the background metric by a constant so that at r = r, we have 0
tt = tt.
eq. (12) then yields

tt =

16gd3

p+1

ab =

16gd

p+1
rp1 [(p)]ab +   

(20)

where the ellipsis denotes terms that vanish more quickly as r  . to apply eq. (14), we
rst dene the background metric for the eld theory by stripping o the divergent conformal
factor from the boundary metric (17):

hab = lim
r

2

r2 ab =(cid:18)1

2[(p)]ab(cid:19) .

the eld theory stress-energy then becomes

htabi =

p+1

16gdp+2 h(p + 1)0

a0

b + habi .

(21)

(22)

so again we can recognize the form characteristic of a thermal gas of massless particles. as a
check, one can easily verify that the total energy is

e =i dphhttti =

p p
16gd2 p+1

(23)

p+1

2 /( p+1

2 ) is the area of a unit p-sphere. this result agrees precisely with that
where p = 2
calculated previously in ref. [13]. one can also check that this result agrees with the energy
calculated from eq. (13) with aa = f (r)1/2t.

another interesting example to consider are the planar black holes described by the metric

ds2 =

r2

2 " 1

rp+1! dt2 + (dxa)2# + 1 

p+1

rp+1!1 2

(24)

where a = 1,   , p. for certain values of p, these metrics arise in the near-horizon geometry of
near-extremal p-branes (see, e.g., [1]). with  = 0, these metrics correspond to adsp+2 space

6

in horospheric coordinates. following the calculations as above, one nds that in this case the
eld theory stress tensor is

htabi =

p+1

16gdp+2h(p + 1)0

a0

b + abi

(25)

where in this case hab = ab is simply the at minkowski metric in p + 1 dimensions. for p = 3,
eq. (24) is precisely the throat geometry of a near-extremal d3-brane, and comparing this result
to the previous section, we nd precise agreement between eqs. (8) and (25), when we use the
identity g10 = g535.

2.3 nice coordinates

in considering absorption of gravitons by d3-branes, one nds that gravitons with polarizations
parallel to the brane couple to the world-volume stress tensor [7, 8]

iint =

1

2z d4x habtab

(26)

as discussed in the introduction, this coupling is actually the current-source coupling for the
graviton in the ads/cft generating function (1), and has been used to investigate correlation
functions of the eld theory stress tensor[9, 10]. as observed in ref. [10], it is convenient to
perform these calculations in radiation gauge for which

hr = 0

(27)

so that the graviton polarizations are automatically in the boundary directions. as the graviton
propagates in a higher dimensional space than the eld theory, one should understand the non-
covariant coupling (2) as being written with this gauge choice in mind.

these observations extend to situations where one is interested in the expectation value of
the stress tensor, rather than correlation functions. we wish to determine the stress tensor of
some supergravity solution with a given metric g which is to be regarded as an excitation of a
background solution with metric g0  that is we are again calculating the stress-energy relative
to some reference background. now a convenient choice of coordinates can be found such that
asymptotically for large radius

grr  g0
gra  g0

rr  o(1/rp+3)
ra  o(1/rp+1)

(28)

where o(1/rq) indicates that these dierences are falling o more rapidly than the indicated
power of r. in principle, one could consider nding coordinates such that these dierences fall
o even more rapidly, but the above behavior is sucient to determine the expectation value of
the stress-energy. with the above choice of coordinates, the leading asymptotic perturbations
of the metric are all in components parallel to the boundary directions. to leading order, the
line element will take the form

ds2 = g0

dxdx + btab

rp1 dxadxb + . . .

7

(29)

one can now read o the stress tensor from the components of the metric perturbations:

htabi  btab. the constant of proportionality (which depends only on the spacetime dimension)
can be xed by calculating the mass of the solution and demanding that httti gives the correct
mass density.

let us apply the above procedure to the spherically symmetric schwarzschild-ads metric

as an example. the radial component of the metric (15) is

grr = f (r)2 =

1

r2

2 + 1  p+1

2 rp1

(30)

while using ads space as the background: g0
rr = (r2/2 +1)1. now by making a transformation
r = r + /rp in the asymptotic region, one can achieve the desired fall o in eq. (28). to be
precise, the r(p+3) perturbation in grr is eliminated with the choice  = p+1
2(p+1) . inserting this
coordinate transformation into the metric (15), and comparing with the asymptotic behavior
in eq. (29), one nds

p

p + 1

p+1
2

bttt =

btab =

p+1
p + 1

[(p)]ab

(31)

while btta = 0. in order to produce the correct energy (as given in the previous section), the

proportionality constant is xed to be

htabi =

p + 1

16gdp btab

ndx =qg0

rr(r)dr

(32)

(33)

which yields a precise agreement with the stress-energy in eq. (22). the same proportionality
constant (and in fact precisely the same transformation of the radial coordinate) in considering
the planar black holes (24) again yields the correct stress-energy (25) using this procedure.

in the above example, we saw the traceless form of the stress tensor emerging naturally
from this choice of coordinates, as well as precise agreement with the results of the previous
section. in fact, one can show that the agreement between the present prescription and that
of the previous section is quite general. consider a metric of the above form (29). for some
surface of xed radius r = r in the asymptotic region, the normal becomes

where to simplify the calculations we have assumed that g0
ra = 0  these metric components can
be eliminated with an appropriate choice of coordinates for generic solutions. the complicated
part of the construction is to match the asymptotic boundary geometries in general. that is
one must nd coordinates such that

g0
ab|r=r = (g0 + g)ab|r=r

(34)

where we have denoted the metric deviation from the background as gab = btab/rp+1 + . . ..

we will assume that we can accomplish this matching by a simple scaling of the coordinates,
as in the examples considered above  this is a limiting assumption on the generality of the
discussion. in this case, the components of the boundary metric in the background become

g0
ab(r)

(g0 + g)ab(r)

g0
ab(r)

8

(35)

where above the values of a and b are xed. the extrinsic curvature of the boundary now
simplies as in eq. (18) to yield

where again a and b are xed in the above formula. carrying out the remaining calculations

and substituting in gab = btab/rp+1 + . . ., one then nds that eq. (14) precisely reproduces the

(38)

3 casimir energies

now we apply the results of the previous section in a discussion of the casimir stress-energy
of the cft on a torus. the discussion will focus on p = 3 for which the eld theory is best
understood, however, for the most part the analysis can be extended to arbitrary dimensions4.
we begin with a brief review of the results of ref. [13], which considered casimir energies with a
single compact direction. the investigation there focussed primarily on the ads soliton, which
is the double analytic continuation of a planar black hole given in eq. (24). the ads soliton
metric for p = 3 is:

ds2 =

r2

2 "dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + 1 

4

r4! dz2# + 1 

4

r4!1 2
r2 dr2

(39)

here the radial coordinate is restricted to r  , and geometry is smooth at r =  provided
that z is identied with period  = 2/. one can calculate the energy of this conguration
relative to a periodically identied ads5 spacetime [13]. using the relations5 between the ads
supergravity parameters and those in the cft, which is n = 4 super-yang-mills theory with
gauge group u(n), one nds that the corresponding energy density is [13]

htttisugra = 

2
8

n 2
4

(40)

now this negative energy density can be thought of as the casimir energy that is generated in
the cft when the fermions are antiperiodic on the circle parameterized by z. these asymptotic
boundary conditions arise for the supergravity fermions because the s1 contracts to a point at

4in particular, the ve-dimensional supergravity solutions considered below are easily generalized to other

dimensions[25].

r = . the casimir energy density can also be calculated directly in the eld theory at weak
coupling, with the result being

hence one nds that this result and the negative energy density of the supergravity solutions
only dier by an overall factor of 3/4. the weak coupling eld theory calculations readily yield
not just the energy density but also the entire stress-energy tensor which is

(41)

(42)

(43)

using any of the techniques in the previous section6, a stress tensor may also be calculated for
the ads soliton with the result

these two stress-energy tensors, (42) and (43), have precisely the same form except for a
single overall factor of 3/4. this discrepancy reects the fact that the two results apply in
dierent regimes of the dual gauge theory. the supergravity results, (40) and (43), correspond
to the eld theory for large t hooft coupling, i.e., g2
y m n >> 1, while the explicit eld theory
results, (41) and (42), are calculated for zero coupling, i.e., g2
y m n = 0. one can expect that
the full stress-energy interpolates smoothly between eqs. (42) and (43) as the coupling ranges
between these two extremes (see, for example, refs. [22, 23]).

motivated by the ads/cft correspondence, the authors in ref. [13] conjectured that the
ads soliton (39) is actually the minimum energy solution with these asymptotic boundary
conditions. as further evidence of this conjecture, the authors showed that the solution (39) is
perturbatively stable against quadratic uctuations of the metric. this perturbative stability
actually extends to many nite deformations which continuously vary the metric (39) which
the authors explored in their investigations [24].

if more than one of the spatial coordinates were compact, i.e., one might consider the cft
in r2  t 2 or r  t 3 rather than r3  s1 as above, then a natural question one might ask if
the casimir energy is further reduced by introducing antiperiodic boundary conditions for the
fermions around more than one of the compact directions. it is straightforward to repeat the
weak gauge coupling calculation of the stress energy for such generalized boundary conditions.
recall that the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory contains a u(n) gauge eld, six scalars in the
adjoint representation, and their superpartner fermions. the stress-energy tensor for this theory
may be found in ref. [8]. to leading order in a gauge coupling expansion, the casimir stress
tensor may be calculated by point-splitting the elds in the stress tensor with the appropriate
free-eld greens function and then removing the vacuum divergence before taking the limit

describe the background geometry, i.e.,

habdxadxb = dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2 .

(44)

to introduce the identications producing a torus in the spatial part of this geometry, we must
now specify three basis vectors ~vi and points are then identied according to

(x, y, z) = (x, y, z) + n1~v1 + n2~v2 + n3~v3

(45)

where the ni are any integers. to simplify the following discussion, we will only consider the
case of r2 t 2, in which case we will drop the vector ~v3. a convenient choice for the remaining
two vectors is

~v1 = (0, 0, z)
~v2 = (0, y cos , y sin )  (0, yc, ys)

(46)

where we will assume cos  > 0.

the desired greens functions may now be determined by the method of images [26]. the

point-splitting calculation then yields as the nonvanishing components of the stress tensor:

it is straightforward to show that this term vanishes for the special case that y sin  = kz

where i, = 0 for periodic boundary conditions around the i cycle, and i, = 1 for antiperiodic
boundary conditions. with antiperiodic boundary conditions around the rst cycle, we recover
the previous result (41) by taking the limit y  . for nite y, it is clear that the extra
contributions make the casimir energy density even more negative7. in particular, even when
the second cycle has periodic boundary conditions, even though the second term above vanishes
the innite sum is making a negative contribution to lower the casimir energy below that in
the previous result.

one may now ask which dual supergravity solutions describe these eld theory congura-
tions. from the discussion in section 2.3, one can infer the asymptotic form of the solutions.
however, nding the full solutions of the nonlinear supergravity equations is a dicult problem.
fortunately, solutions which appear to describe the case where sin  = 0, i.e., ~v1  ~v2 = 0, are
already available in the literature [25]. the ve-dimensional metric may be written as

the geometry is singular at r = . for example, rr  2/4/(r  )2 as r approaches

to determine the corresponding eld theory stress-energy, we use the prescription of section

which has a form reminiscent of the eld theory result (47), i.e., the stress tensor is traceless
and generically httti = htxxi 6= htyyi 6= htzzi. since this stress tensor is diagonal, however, it
seems that this solution can only describe the situation with sin  = 0, i.e., the cycles on the
torus are orthogonal.

up to this point, no consideration has been made of identication of the y and z coordinates
in the supergravity background (50). to parallel the eld theory calculation, we should identify
y  y + y and z  z + z. in the special case of the ads soliton, demanding that the geometry
be free of singularities relates the periodicity of one of the coordinates to the parameter  (as
described below eq. (39)). however, in the present case with generic exponents, one cannot
avoid a curvature singularity at r = . therefore without understanding the stringy physics
that underlies this region of strong curvature, there is no natural way to relate the periods to the
parameter . given the results for the near-extremal d-branes and the ads soliton, one might
expect that the ratios of the various components of the stress-energy are the same in the strong
coupling supergravity regime as arise in the weak coupling calculations. with this assumption
for a given pair of periodicities (and sin  = 0), one could calculate the relative size of the
components of the weak coupling stress tensor (47), and then match these ratios in the strong
coupling result (55) with a choice of exponents. given the innite double sums in eq. (47),
we have no analytical results to oer. however, one can examine the eld theory stress tensor
numerically, and it is clear (for sin  = 0) that one can always choose the exponents in eq. (55)
to match the overall form of htabi in the two calculations. for example, with (,) boundary
conditions, as z/y varies from 1 to , htabi is matched by choosing 1+ in eq. (52) and
choosing 2 between (1 +3)/4 and 1. there remains the question of the overall normalization
of the strong coupling stress-energy, but this seems to require a knowledge of physics at string
scale curvatures.

13

4 discussion

the eld theory stress-energy tensor provides an interesting tool with which to study the
ads/cft correspondence. in section 2, we have provided a number of dierent approaches to
calculating htabi for a given supergravity solution. note that each of the calculations presented
there requires a background solution, which essentially denes the zero for the stress tensor.
that is the calculations yield the stress-energy of the given solution relative to the reference
background.

the presence of a background solution is useful in making contact with earlier discussions
of expectation values of cft operators[5]. this discussion originally relied on considering
solutions of the linearized equations of motion around ads space, however, it actually extended
to solutions of the full nonlinear supergravity equations in considering d-instantons[5]. one
can (at least roughly) classify the solutions of the linearized equations as modes which are
singular at the boundary of ads, and those which are singular at the interior. the modes that
are singular at the boundary are the ones associated with the source currents for the cft in
calculating correlation functions [3], while those that are singular at the interior are associated
with expectation values [5]. however the fact that the latter modes are singular (i.e., reach
large values) in the interior of ads means that one must go beyond the linearized equations of
motion to consider expectation values in general.8 the black hole solutions in eqs. (15) and (24)
are a good example in that they are solutions of the full nonlinear (super)gravity equations of
motion. however, asymptotically these solutions approach ads space, and one can regard the
deviations of the metric from the ads solution as solutions of the linearized gravity equations.
closer examination shows that these linearized solutions correspond to modes which become
singular in the interior of ads, which now simply means that the full solutions enter a nonlinear
regime. with the choice of coordinates in section 2.3, one can further match the expectation
value of the stress-energy to the general calculations discussed in ref. [5].

on the other hand, matching the asymptotic geometry of the (super)gravity solutions to
that of a reference background is a technical nuisance. in fact there are solutions for which
there is no natural choice of a background solution, e.g., taub-nut-ads  as discussed in
[27]. from this point of view, balasubramanian and kraus [14] recently presented a superior
technique. while the basis of their calculations is the quasilocal stress-energy [21] discussed
in section 2.2, they avoid the background subtraction by introducing a counterterm subtrac-
tion, which only relies on the intrinsic boundary geometry of the solution of interest. this
new technique provides a denition of the total energy which then represents a remarkable
departure from previous investigations of gravitational energy, which appears to be unique to
asymptotically ads spacetimes. while relying on a background subtraction was sucient for
our investigation of the casimir energies on toroidal geometries in section 3, it seems that the
counterterm subtraction technique will be essential in calculating the casimir stress-energy
for more complicated geometries. for example, one can determine the casimir energy for the
super-yang-mills theory on r  s3 from a supergravity calculation on ads5 alone [14].

by considering the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in the dual cft, we seem
to have found an interesting interpretation of the supergravity solutions (50) found in ref. [25].

8the linearized modes are still useful in considering the expectation values associated with test probes moving

in the supergravity spacetime[5, 6].

14

these solutions appear to be dual to the cft on a two-torus with nonsupersymmetric boundary
conditions imposed on the fermions around the cycles of the torus. as mentioned previously,
the solutions provided by ref. [25] are general enough that the discussion here and in section 3
can be extended to the cft on t 3 or t 4, as well as the ads/cft correspondence in higher
dimensions. however, these solutions appear to be limited to the case where the cycles on
the torus are orthogonal, e.g., sin  = 0 in eq. (46).
it may be interesting to extend this
family of solutions to include tori with non-orthogonal cycles, for which generically the stress
tensor acquires o-diagonal terms. from the discussion of section 2.3 then, one sees that the
new supergravity solutions will include nontrivial o-diagonal metric components. of course,
the coordinates of section 2.3 may not be the optimal choice for actually determining the full
nonlinear solutions.
it may be that considering the transformation properties of the stress-
energy under the action of sl(d, z) on t d (see e.g., [28]) may be useful in trying to construct
the extended family of solutions.
in any event, given such a set of solutions, it would be
interesting to understand the action of the sl(d, z) symmetry on the supergravity spacetime.
it could be that this symmetry would be a useful tool in determining the overall normalization
of the strong coupling stress-energy without recourse to a complete understanding of string
theory in regions of strong curvature.

we should remark that we have only found an interesting interpretation for a subset of the
solutions in eq. (50). fixing 2 (and hence 1+) determines the ratio of the components of
the stress-energy (55), and so for a certain set of boundary conditions in the cft, this then
xes the ratio z/y from eq. (47). fixing 4 then sets the overall scale, and so through some
unknown stringy physics, this determines z. however, any identications in y and z are left
implicit in the supergravity solution (50), and so for xed 2 and 4, these solutions exist for
arbitrary values of y and z. therefore our interpretation in terms of antiperiodic fermion
boundary conditions only applies to a set of measure zero in the full space of solutions implicitly
given by eq. (50). it may be that more creative boundary conditions may allow one to provide
a cft interpretation for some (discrete number) of the other solutions, but it seems unlikely
that a reasonable interpretation can be found for a generic set of parameters in this family of
solutions.

this then raises the question of which singularities or which singular solutions are physically
interesting in the context of the ads/cft correspondence. one response would be that such
singularities simply represent regions of strong curvature where the low energy (super)gravity
theory breaks down, but that the singularity would be resolved in a physically sensible way
by the full theory of quantum gravity (e.g., superstring- or m-theory). it was argued in ref. [29]
that this point of view can not be correct, by considering negative mass schwarzschild solution
of the einstein equations. the argument there applies equally well in present context with
a negative cosmological constant. if the time-like singularities at the center of negative mass
black hole-ads solutions were resolved within the full quantum gravity theory, no stable
ground state would exist. hence it is clear that certain singularities must be unphysical and so
not all singular solutions (or solutions with regions of strong curvature) are physically relevant.

in certain special cases, singular solutions may be distinguished by being supersymmetric,
and so there may be greater merit in considering such singularities. we remind the reader
that such a solution implicitly played a role in section 3. the background solution in that
case was ads space with periodic identications in the horospheric coordinates. this solution
has a conical singularity at the null surface r = 0, which is a horizon in the absence of any

15

identications. the fact that the background is supersymmetric would appear to add weight to
our assumption that string theory is able to resolve this singularity. in the ads/cft context,
charged black hole solutions have an interesting interpretation [30], but it turns out that the
corresponding supersymmetric solutions [31] are actually naked (null) singularities whose role
remains to be determined.

in the case of the metric (50), the singularity is again a null singularity as in the two preced-
ing examples, but the solution is not supersymmetric. we might add that if one evaluates the
supergravity action (making a background subtraction with ads) the result is nite [25]. this
comes about because the metric is a solution of the supergravity equations, and so the curvature
singularity at r = 0 does not manifest itself in the ricci scalar. divergences are present in the
curvature scalars which appear as the higher order  corrections to the supergravity action 
see, for example, [22]. of course, to properly evaluate the action including such corrections,
one would have to construct a solution of the higher order equations of motion. however, if the
higher order terms play more than a perturbative role (as they would near the singularity), one
must (determine and) solve the full superstring equations of motion to produce a consistent
solution.

thus the ads/cft correspondence seems to provide another situation in which curvature
singularities seem to play an interesting role in string theory (see, for example, [32]). given
the discussion up to this point, it appears remarkable that the case with the cft on r3  s1
corresponds to a dual supergravity solution which is everywhere smooth. however, we would
now like to present an alternative point of view which argues that this behavior should not be
exceptional. the motivation for these arguments will be cosmic censorship [33].

let us begin by considering the ads5 spacetime in horospheric coordinates, i.e., eq. (39)
with 4 = 0, in which one of the spatial coordinates is periodically identied, say y = y + y.
further we expect the following conclusion about the supergravity to be independent of any
boundary conditions on the supergravity fermions in this direction. now introducing a planar
conguration of matter into this spacetime with sucient density, we expect that the system
will collapse to form a black hole which settles to a metric of the form in eq. (24) with p =
3. this expectation is prejudiced by our experience with cosmic censorship and black hole
uniqueness theorems [34] in other settings. distinguishing the metric component gyy from the
other spatial directions would be like adding hair to the black hole and produce a singular
conguration similar to the solutions (50). cosmic censorship dictates that gravity avoid this
solution dynamically by radiating away any such hair during the collapse that leads to the
formation of the black hole. thus the black hole solution (24) would appear to be the physically
relevant solution independent of the period y! given this conclusion, one would expect that a
double analytic continutation will yield the supergravity solution dual to the cft on r2  t 2.
certainly the calculations for the thermal ensemble on s1 and the casimir stress-energy on
t 2 have a common euclidean framework, as discussed in ref. [13]. one would thus conclude
that the ads soliton (39) is still the relevant dual supergravity solution independent of any
additional compactications, as well as of the boundary conditions imposed in those directions.

hence independent of the period y, the expectation value of the stress tensor would be that
of the ads soliton as given in eq. (43). in particular then one has 3httti = 3htxxi = 3htyyi =
htzzi, independent of y or the boundary conditions imposed on the y-cycle. certainly this
result does not match the form of the weak coupling result (even with sin  = 0) given in

16

eq. (47). of course, the form of the latter result does go over to that of the supergravity
calculation in the limit that y  . there is no inconsistency here, of course. one would
simply conclude that the various components of the stress tensor evolve independently as the
t hooft parameter increases from zero in the explicit eld theory calculation to large values
where the supergravity result applies. thus the eects of the additional identications seem to
be erased by the supergravity dynamics in the large n limit.

while this scenario may be reasonable in a situation where the periodicity of one direction
is much smaller than that of any others, it should appear problematic for periodicities of
roughly the same size. analogous to the discussion in ref. [3], a possible resolution is that
the supergravity partition function (1) includes contributions from dierent ads solitons in
each of which one of the compact directions with antiperiodic fermions shrinks to zero on the
interior. for a given set of periodicities, the relative size of the contributions of the dierent
supergravity solutions would be determined by their euclidean action. in the case where one of
the periodicities is much smaller than the others, the corresponding ads soliton dominates the
partition function. when the periodicities are roughly the same size, no single solution would
be dominant. the expectation htabi would presumably then be given by a weighted sum of
that calculated for the individual solutions.9

thus we have presented two very dierent pictures of the supergravity description of the
dual cft on a torus. the rst involves singular solutions, but relies on the assumption that
the ratios of the various components of the stress tensor are preserved as the t hooft coupling
varies. the only evidence given to support of this assumption was that it was observed to
be true for the cft on r3  s1. however, this is not a very strong argument since in that
case, the form of the stress-energy is really determined by the symmetries of the background
geometry and the traceless property of the stress tensor. in the second scenario, the supergravity
dynamics erases the complicated details which the eld theory boundary conditions produce
at weak coupling. this picture is motivated by cosmic censorship and black hole uniqueness
which, however, have not been well studied in the context of ads space. another weakness in
these arguments about the dynamics is that while it is claimed that the post-collapse black hole
should be nonsingular, the pre-collapse conguration will almost certainly contain a singularity
at the interior due to the periodic identication of z. even if the second scenario is correct,
it seems that the gravitational abhorence of singularities must only be a large n eect in the
cft. it would be interesting to understand the physics of these congurations at nite n where
it is claimed that the super-yang-mills theory should resolve the singularities associated with
gravitational collapse [36].

finally we would like to comment on the implications of the present results for the positive
energy theorem of ref. [13]. we have found that there are singular supergravity solutions which
have a lower energy than the ads soliton, which was conjectured to be a minimum energy
solution. this should not come as a surprise. one can easily nd singular solutions with
arbitrarily negative energies, such as negative mass black holes. the positive energy theorem
at least in the form of conjectures 2 and 3 in ref. [13] is that the ads soliton should be the
minimum energy solution within the space of smooth solutions. the important point that
was considered here was that some singular solutions may be physically relevant for type iib

9it appears that with this approach that there can be a phase transition in the thermal ensemble on a torus
from the high entropy black hole to the zero-entropy ads soliton at low temperatures  see refs. [3, 30, 35] for
discussions of similar phase transitions.

17

superstring theory. if this is the case, it would certainly aect conjecture 1 which was phrased
in terms of the full ten-dimensional type iib superstring theory. as we have discussed above
though, string theory may still choose to ignore these singular solutions and describe the dual
cft in terms of asymptotically ads geometries which are everywhere smooth.
