abstract

the hamiltonian treatment of constrained systems in gulers for-
malism leads us to the total dierential equations in many variables.
these equations are integrable if the corresponding system of partial
dierential equations is a jacobi system. the main aim of this paper
is to investigate the quantization of the nite dimensional systems with
constraints using the canonical formalism introduced by guler. this
approach is applied for two systems with constraints and the results
are in agreement with those obtained by diracs canonical quatization
method and path integral quantization method.

1 introduction

the canonical formulation[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6] give us the set of hamiltonian-
jacobi partial-dierential equation as

h0 = l(t, qi, q, qa = wa + pawa + qp |p =h ,  = 0, n  r + 1,    , n (3)

if conditions(6) are not satised identically , one consider them as a new
constraints and again tests the consistency conditions. thus repeting this
procedure one may obtain a set of conditions.

the main aim of this paper is to investigate the quantization of the nite
dimensional systems using gulers formalism. we test our formalism on two
systems with rst and respectively second class constraints.

the plan of this paper is the following:
a brief information of the gulers formalism is given in sect.1. in sec.2
the quantization of the systems with constraints is investigated.the examples
are worked out in sec.3 in sec.4 we present our conclusions.

2 quantization of the systems with constraints

in gulers formalism

let us suppose that for a nite dimensional system with constraints we found
all independent hamiltonians h
 using the calculus of variations[1],[2],[4]. be-
cause all the hamiltonians h
 are constraints we will use diracs procedure of
quatization[7]. we have





h



 = 0,  = 1,    , r

where  is the wave function. the consistency conditions are

[h



, h



] = 0, ,  = 1,    r

if for a nite dimensional system the hamiltonians h



 satise

[h



, h



] = c 

 h

(7)

(8)

(9)

the system has rst class constraints in the diracs classication.

on the other hand if

[h



, h



] = c

(10)

where c do not depend of qi and pi then from(8) we will arise naturally at
diracs brackets and the canonical quatization will be performed taking diracs
brackets into commutators.

gulers formalism give us and the action when all hamiltonians h

 are
in involution. because in this formalism we work from the beginning in the
extended space we suppose that variables t depend of  .here  is canonical
conjugate with p0. we propose the following expression for the action



z = z (ha + pa



h
a
pa

) tad

(11)

where  = dt
d .

if we are able , for a given nite system with constraints, to nd the inde-
pendent hamiltonians h
 in involution then we can perform the quantization of
this system using path integral quantization method with the action from(11).



3 examples

3.1 a system with rst class constraints

consider the following lagrangian(for more details see[2])

2l = aij qi qj + 2b q2  2c, i, j = 1, 2, 3

(12)

the generalized momenta read as

p1 = a1 q1, p2 = a2( q3  q2) + b, p3 = a2( q3  q2)

(13)

then we have two hamiltonians in the gulers formalism

h



0 = p0 +

1
2

(

p2
1
a1



p2
3
a2

) + c, h



2 = p2 + p3  b

(14)

here a,b and c are constants.

at this stage we have two ways for quantization of the system presented

above.

because we have two constraints h



0 and h



2 diracs canonical formalism

for the systems with constraints will be applied[7].

then we have

h



2 = 0, h



0 = 0

(15)

where  is the wave function.

3

the consistency condition give us the following commutation relation

[h



2, h



0] = 0

(16)

and it is automatically satises because the hamiltonians h



2 and h



0 commute.

we found that a solution of eq.(15) has the following form

 = (b2 + 2c)ebq3[sin q1 + cos q1]

(17)

for the path integral quantization we need the action z. using gulers

formalism we found

or

dz = (c +

p2
1
2a1



p2
3
2a2

+ b q2)d

z = z (c +

p2
1
2a1



p2
3
2a2

+ b q2)d

(18)

(19)

we know that for a system with n degrees of freedom with r rst class-
constraints a the path integral representation is given as[for more detailes
see ref.[8]]

< q

 | exp[i(t

  t) h0] | q >= z yt

d(qj, pj)exp[i{z +



dt(pj qj  h0)}],

j = 1,    , n

where the measure of integration is given as

d(q, p) = det | {a, b} |

r

ya=1

(a)(a)

n

yj=1

dqjdpj

(20)

(21)

and a are r gauge constraints.

if we perform now the usual path integral quantization using (20) for the
system (12) , after imposing the gauge condition and integrate over q2, we get
the action (19) when  is replaced by t.

3.2 a system with second class constraints

let us consider the lagrangian [4]

l =

1
2

a1 q2

1 

1
2

a2( q2

2  2 q2 q3 + q2

3 + b q2  c

(22)

here a1, a2, b, c are functions of q1, q2, q3, t. let us specify the functions a1, a2, b, c
as a1 = 1, a2 = 1

2 , b = q1 + q3, c = q1 + q2 + q2
3.
from (22) we found two hamiltonians h
0 and h



2.



h



0 = p0 +

1
2

(p2

1  2p3

3) + q1 + q2 + q2

3 = 0

(23)

4

h



2 = p2 + p3  q1  q3 = 0

(24)

if we impose the variations of(23) and(24) to be zero we get a new independent
hamiltonian

h



1 = p1 + 2p3  2q3  1 = 0

then we have three independent hamiltonians h



0,h



1 and h



2.

diracs method of quantization give us the following relations[7]

h



0 = 0, h



1 = 0, h



2 = 0

and the consistency conditions

[h



0, h



1] = 0

[h



0, h



2] = 0

[h



1, h



2] = 0

[h



1, h



2] = 1

here  is the wave function.

because

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

and the consistency condition(29) is not satises. in the diracs classication
of constraints h
2 are second class constraints. at this stage we will
introduce the diracs brackets for our system.

1 and h





the explicite calculations give us the following form

{f, g}d.b. = {f, g} + {f, h



2}{h



1, g}  {f, h



1}{h



2, g}

(31)

and we can perform the canonical quantization taking diracs brackets into
commutators.



now we would like to nd the action using gulers formalism. because the
2 are not in involution we extend the phase-space with
2 and

hamiltonians h
another pairs of conjugate variables (, p) .the new hamiltonians 
3 are in involution and have the following expressions


0,h

1,h

1 ,













1 = p0 +


1
2

(p2

1  2p3

3) + q1 + q2 + q2

3 + (1  4p3 + 4q3)

+ p(p1  2p3  1 + 2q3) 

1
2

p2
 = p0 + 1



2 = p2 + p3  q1  q3 +  = p2 + 2




3 = p1  2q3 + 2p3  1  p = p + 3


from(5) we get the following expression for the action z

(32)

(33)

(34)

dz = (1 + p1 q1 + p2 q2 + p3 q3 + p  + q2p3 + (p1 + 2p3))d

(35)

5

or

z = z (1 + p1 q1 + p2 q2 + p3 q3 + p  + q2p3 + (p1 + 2p3))d

(36)

in our case the extended system has rst class constraints in diracs classica-
tion. the action(36) give us the same result as the expression for the eective
action from (20) for the system with rst class constraints (32),(33),(34) when
we consider t =  .the only dierence is that the gauge conditions have dier-
ent expressions in gulers formalism.

4 concluding remarks

in this paper the quantization of the nite dimensional systems with con-
straints using canonical formalism introduced by guler was investigated .

in this formalism we have no rst or second class constraints in the diracs
classication at the classical level but the constraints arises naturally in the set
of consistency conditions(8) at the quantum level. the secondary constraints
are obtained in gulers formalism using calculus of variations. when a sys-
tem has second class constraints the diracs brackets in gulers formalism
are dened on the extended space (qi,  ). in this case we enlarge the system
and convert the second class constraints into rst class constraints in order to
obtaining the hamiltonians in involution. when the hamiltonians h
 are in
involution we can construct the action in gulers formalism. in this formal-
ism all dependent variables t are gauge variables and we suppose that these
variables have a dependence of  (a canonical conjugate variable with p0). in
the case when hamiltonians h
 commute the action (11) has the same form as
obtained by path integral quantization method after performing all the calcu-
lations. in this case the results are in perfect agreement with those obtained
by usually path quantization method of system with constraints.
