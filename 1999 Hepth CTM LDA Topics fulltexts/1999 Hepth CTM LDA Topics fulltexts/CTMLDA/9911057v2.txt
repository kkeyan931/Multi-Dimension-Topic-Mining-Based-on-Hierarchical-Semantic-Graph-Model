abstract

non-commutative supersymmetric yang-mills with rational  is dual to an ordinary
supersymmetric yang-mills with a t hooft ux. it is believed that the simplest de-
scription is via the ordinary supersymmetric yang-mills. we claim, however, that the
two descriptions form a hierarchy. the sym description is the proper description in
the ultra violet while the non-commutative description takes over in the infra red.

1 introduction

it is well known that a non-commutative supersymmetric yang-mills theory (ncsym) with
non-commutativity scale  on a torus of size  is equivalent to an ordinary supersymmetric
yang-mills theory (osym) with a magnetic ux if the dimensionless non-commutativity
parameter  = 2/2 is a rational number. the equivalence between the ncsym and the
osym can be understood naturally as arising from the t-duality of the underlying string
theory [1, 2]. the structure of t-duality survives the decoupling limit and can be identied
as the morita equivalence of the ncsym. the precise relation between t-duality and morita
equivalence was studied extensively [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

whenever a theory admits dual descriptions, there is always a unique canonical de-
scription that is in some sense natural. for example, in the case of duality relation which
exchanges strong and weak couplings, it is more natural to describe the physics in terms
of the weakly coupled theory. this is not a useful criterion for our purposes since morita
equivalence is not a strong-weak duality but rather a local-nonlocal duality. that is, it takes
a local excitation of one description to a non-local excitation of the dual description. this
suggests that the natural description is the one which is most local.

in light of this criterion, one might be inclined to conclude that the osym description is
the ultimately local and therefore the most natural description of this theory. in that case,
one can forget all together about the ncsym with rational . however, in the presence of
the magnetic ux, there are very light excitations, the electric uxes, which are highly non-
local. the locality of the osym description breaks down when these non-local excitations
start to dominate the dynamics, and this happens precisely in the infra red at the energies
of the order of the volume of the torus.

the primary goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the dynamics of these light non-
local degrees of freedom of the osym admits a natural local description in terms of the
ncsym. in other words, the ncsym takes over as the natural local description in the infra
red when the locality of the osym breaks down due to nite size and the magnetic ux. this
is the sense in which the ncsym description is physically signicant and should therefore
not be dismissed even if the theory is equivalent to some osym by duality. ncsym and
osym are the components in the hierarchy of the phases of the same theory.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we describe the osym-ncsym hierarchy
using weakly coupled eld theory arguments. we also show how similar structures emerge
from the supergravity description of these theories in the limit of large t hooft coupling.
concluding remarks and applications are presented in section 3.

2 ncsym as the low energy limit of osym

in this section, we will show how dierent morita equivalent theories form a hierarchy of
phases, and that for any given energies, there is a unique simple/natural description.

we start with the simplest case of ncsym with  = 1/s for some integer s. there are
two natural morita equivalent descriptions of this theory: the ncsym description in the
infra red and the osym in the ultra violet. in section 2.1 we show this for a weakly coupled
theory while in section 2.2 we obtain the same result for the strongly coupled theory using
the supergravity description.

the general rational case  = r/s is considered in section 2.3. it is shown that as we
increase the energy, the non-commutativity scale of the natural description decreases until
we end up with some osym description in the deep ultra violet. we also comment briey
on the irrational case.

2.1 ncsym with  = 1/s

consider a u(n) ncsym with coupling constant gy m and vanishing magnetic ux (m = 0)
on a torus of size  with  = 1/s for some integer s  1. this theory is equivalent to an
ordinary sym with

n = sn,

 =


s

,

g2
y m =

g2
y m
s

,

m = n.

(2.1)

the relevant properties of the t-duality (morita equivalence) used to derive this relation are
summarized in the appendix.

it may seem strange that a theory dened on a torus whose volume is smaller by a factor
of 1/s2  1 can be equivalent to a ncsym on a much larger volume 2, since the momentum
modes in the ordinary theory have a gap of the order 1/  = s/ while the momentum modes
in the non-commutative description have a gap of the order 1/. however, the fact that
the background has a non-vanishing magnetic ux m (or a twisted boundary condition [16])
plays a signicant role here. in a presence of such a twist, the energies for the excitations
corresponding to the electric uxes winding around the torus are quantized in the units of

gcd( m, n)

n

1


=

1
s 

.

(2.2)

this was shown in [17] by studying the small uctuation of gauge elds in the t hooft ux
background [16] and can also be seen from the string theory considerations [18]. this can
also be thought of as a realization of the mechanism of [19]. in this way, the osym in a
twisted background and the ncsym can have the same physical content.

2

we will now argue that the ncsym and the osym descriptions provide a natural
description of the dynamics in a non-overlapping range of energies (see gure 1). consider
rst the ncsym. the range of energies where this description is natural is bounded both in
the ultra violet and in the infra red. the infra red bound is the usual one which appears also
for local theories. namely, by lowering the energies to be of order 1/, we reach energies of
the order of the mass gap of the momentum modes and the eective description is in terms
of the 2d osym.

the bound in the ultra violet is more interesting because ordinarily, the nite size do not
aect the ultra violet. this is not the case with theories on non-commutative spaces. by
going to higher energies, one might succeed in making the compton wavelength x2 = 1/e
along, say, the 2 direction to be small. this will cause the size of the excitations to grow in
the 3-direction in keeping with the non-commutativity x2x3 > 2. since x3 is bounded
by the size of the box , we nd that e must be bounded above by /2 in order to keep
the excitations localized. combining these observations, we learn that the physics of the
ncsym is natural in the range of energies

1


< e <


2 =

s


.

(2.3)

it is important to emphasize that at the fundamental level the ncsym description does
not break down above that scale. it is just becoming very complicated because the relevant
excitations are not localized relative to the size of the torus.

let us now consider the osym. since this theory is an ordinary conformal eld theory,
one can expect this description to remain valid at arbitrarily high energies. however, on the
infra red side, the momentum modes have a gap of the order of 1/ . therefore, the range
of naturalness of the osym description is bounded in the infra red by e = 1/  = s/.
below this energy, we have a two dimensional osym in the absence of the magnetic ux. in
the presence of the magnetic charge, however, there are excitations which are much lighter
than the gap of the momentum modes, 1/ . these are the electric uxes1 whose energies
are quantized in the units of 1/. since the compton wave lengths of the states with such
energies are much larger than the size of the torus, these excitations are highly non-local and
hence it is very hard to describe their dynamics in terms of the osym. in terms of the dual
ncsym description, these excitations are nothing but the momentum modes (see appendix
and [11, 14]) whose dynamics is much simpler.

it should be emphasized that the physics of the cross-over on the infra red side is dierent
between the twisted sym and the untwisted sym. in the untwisted sym, the cross-over

1at an intuitive level, the electric uxes behave dierently in the magnetic background because they also
carry momentum due to the pointing vector ~p  ~b  ~e. see the appendix and [11, 17] for a more detailed
discussion.

figure 1: the phases of sym on r2  t 2: in the absence of a magnetic ux the theory ows
to a two dimensional theory at energies below 1/ . in the presence of a magnetic ux there
are excitations which are lighter than 1/ . the dynamics of these excitations is described
by the ncsym in four dimensions. only deeper in the infra red the theory becomes two
dimensional.

in the infra red is due to the freezing of all but the zero momentum modes, whereas in the
twisted sym, there are additional degrees of freedom due to the electric uxes. the dynamics
of these degrees of freedom is given not in terms of a dimensionally reduced theory, but by
the 4d ncsym.

it should also be emphasized that the twisted sym, the ncsym, and the dimensionally
reduced sym descriptions are natural in their respective non-overlapping range of energies,
but they combine to cover the full range of energies.

2.2 large t hooft coupling and supergravity

in the previous subsection, we assumed that the theory is weakly coupled to argue that the
duality between the ncsym and the osym gives rise to a hierarchy of phases. we will
now show that a similar hierarchy appears also in the strongly coupled theory. this suggests
that the structure of ncsym-osym hierarchy is not sensitive to the value of the coupling
constant.

the supergravity solution which is dual to the ncsym with large t hooft coupling is

with periodicities x2  x2 + 2 and x3  x3 + 2. in the innite volume limit (  ),
the solution can be trusted everywhere for large n and . for nite , the supergravity
description breaks down at the ultra violet since the size of the torus is shrinking. this implies
that a dierent t-dual description takes over. the transition occurs when the invariant size
of the torus is of the order of the string length, so that the momentum modes are no longer
the lightest modes. this happens at

u =

1/4

2

.

(2.5)

similarly, the size of the torus becomes small when u gets smaller than 1/4/. this im-
plies, using the uv/ir relation [22], that the range of energies for which the supergravity
description of the ncsym at large t hooft is valid is

1/4

< e <

1/4


2 .

(2.6)

this has basically the same form as (2.3) up to the factor of 1/4 which is a strong coupling
eect.

outside this range of energies, some other t-dual description is more natural. in the
infra red the proper description is via the near horizon limit of d1-branes [23]. this is just
the supergravity realization of the fact that the theory ows in the infra red to a theory in
two dimensions. this transition, which involves a gregory-laamme transition [24, 25] in
addition to the t-duality, was discussed in [26, 27, 28] and will not elaborated on further
here.

the more interesting transition for our discussion is the one in the ultra violet. the way

t-duality acts on the supergravity solution is the following [29]. dene

figure 2: the dierent phases from the supergravity point of view. each of the curves
in corresponds to the volume of the torus in the supergravity solution as a function of
e = u/1/4 where we absorbed the factor of 1/4 into the denition of e to account for
the eect of strong coupling. we see that there are, like in the weakly coupled case, three
phases, corresponding to the dimensionally reduced sym, the ncsym, and the twisted
osym. this is to be compared against the case with m = 0, which we illustrated in the
same gure using the dotted line. here, there are only two phases, corresponding to the
dimensionally reduced sym and the osym.

it is clear from (2.9) that generically, v23 will always be small for suciently large u. in
the case where  = 2/2 = 1/s, however, the coecient of the term in the denominator
of (2.9) proportional to u 4 can be set to zero by choosing c = 1, d = s. this is the same
element of sl(2, z) which mapped the ncsym to the osym in the previous subsection,
and gives rise to the following background

with periodicities x2  x2 + 2  and x3  x3 + 2 . the background geometry is exactly
ads5  s5 which implies [30] that the theory is osym in 4d. the presence of the constant
background b-eld gives rise to the twist in the corresponding boundary theory. in partic-
ular, the constant b-eld modies the spectrum of closed string winding modes and not of
the momentum modes, just as the twist modies the spectrum of the electric uxes and not
of the local momentum modes. the radius of s 5 remained the same as (2.4). on the other
hand, the number of d3-branes is multiplied by a factor of s, which can be seen either from
the form of the dilaton or the form of the rr eld background which can be found in [21].
the size of the torus, on the other hand, is smaller by a factor of s. all these features are in
agreement with the eld theory results of equation (2.1) which relate the ncsym and the
osym.

2.3 general 

in light of the analysis in the previous subsection for the case when  = 1/s, it is straight
forward to understand what happens in the case of a more general . consider rst the case
where  = r/s is some rational number. just as before, the ncsym description is expected
to be the natural description in the range of energies

1


< e <


2 =

s
r

,

(2.11)

and the dimensionally reduced description takes over for e < 1/. on the other hand, the
osym description is only valid at energies above e = s/, and for r > 1, there is a gap
between s/r and s/. therefore, there must be some other morita equivalent description
which is valid in this intermediate regime. indeed, it is easy to see that for every energy
scale e, there is one and only one morita equivalent description which satises

1


< e <


2

.

(2.12)

it is straight forward to search for the appropriate sl(2, z) dual description using the
relevant equations given in the appendix. for example, for  = 13/47 we nd the following
chain of natural descriptions2

where m is an element of sl(2, z) dening the morita dual relative to the original theory
with  = 13/47.

once the case of general rational  is understood, it is not dicult to see what happens
in the case of irrational . since for irrational  we can never reach the  = 0 theory
by nite action of sl(2, z), the chain of morita equivalent theories will not terminate but
continue indenitely. for example, for  =  where   0.58 is the eulers constant, we nd

(2.14)

let us pause and comment about the general structure of these chains of theories. first,

the parameters of two adjacent members of this chain should satisfy an inequality

from this, it follows immediately that

(2.15)

(2.16)

which states that both the non-commutativity and the volume decreases monotonically along
the chain. second, since all of these theories are equivalent to one another at the microscopic
level, they should all have the same thermodynamic properties. therefore, the relation
between the entropy s and the temperature t

2rt 3,

n = n   m,

(2.17)

must be invariant under the sl(2, z) duality group, which we verify in the appendix. here,
r denotes the compactication radius in the x1 direction, which we take to be much larger
then .

the same basic structure can be seen also in the supergravity description of the same
model with large t hooft coupling. in gures 3.a and 3.b, we plot v23(e) for the chain of
natural morita equivalent theories (2.13) and (2.14) with  = 13/47 and  =   0.58,
respectively. the vertical lines delineate the range of energies tabulated in (2.13) and (2.14).
the left most peak in gures 3.a and 3.b illustrate the dependence of the torus size as a
function of e of the supergravity background corresponding to the ncsym (2.4). each
successive peaks correspond to the supergravity background of some morita dual. a given
supergravity description is natural when v(e) is of order one or greater. therefore, we nd
that the chain of natural morita equivalent theories (2.13) and (2.14) is also natural from
the point of view of supergravity. if  is rational, eventually we will encounter v(e) which
grows like e2 indenitely (2.10). this is the right most curve illustrated in gure 3.a and
corresponds to the osym. for irrational  like the one illustrated in gure 3.b, new peaks
will appear indenitely for arbitrarily large e.

3 conclusions

the goal of the paper was to show that the theories which are related by morita equivalence
have natural bounds in energies (2.3) for which the dynamics of the eective degrees of
freedom are most local and therefore natural. in this way, various morita equivalent theories
form a hierarchy of phases, each being the appropriate description for the physics at that
scale. we showed, for weakly as well as for strongly coupled theories, that such a natural
description is unique at any given energies. for rational  we nd a nite chain of natural
descriptions which ends in the ultra violet by a twisted osym. for irrational  we nd an
innite chain of natural ncsym descriptions.

we will close by commenting on an amusing application3 of the ncsym-osym hierarchy
to a version of large n reduction of gauge theories [31, 32, 33, 34]. as we described earlier,

(cid:18)u(n) ncsym  = 1/s(cid:19) = (cid:18)u(sn) osym m = n(cid:19)

(3.1)

at the microscopic level due to morita equivalence. the theory on the left hand side can
be described to a good approximation by the usual sym (on the same space-time with the
same gauge group and no twist) at energies below the non-commutativity scale

1

(3.2)

this follows from the fact that the -product deforms the sym by irrelevant operators which
do not aect the infra red dynamics. if we now take the limit s  , the theory on the

left hand side reduces to an ordinary u(n) sym on a torus of size . on the other hand,
the theory on the right hand side becomes a u(sn) theory dened on r2  t 2 with a twist
m = n. the size of the t 2 goes to zero in the large s limit, and in this way, we have
related u(n) theory in four dimensions to a u(sn) theory in two dimensions. it is easy to
generalize to a reduction from four dimensions to zero dimensions by considering the case
where x0 and x1 are non-commutative as well. it would be interesting to see if such a relation
derived using the morita equivalence is related to the traditional ideas of large n reduction
[31, 32, 33, 34] as well as to some more recent works [35, 36, 37].

the  dependent term in the action is topological and its main role is to twist [16] the
vacuum. this parameter appears in the construction of the ncsym via the decoupling
limit of open strings on d3-branes as was explained in [15]. the precise role played by  in
mapping t-duality to morita equivalence was elucidated recently in [14].

the energy of an excited state is given in the second and the third terms of (a.6). we

recalling the construction of the ncsym as a decoupling limit of d3-branes in type iib
string theory wrapping s1  t 2 [1, 2, 15], consider acting on the t 2 by an element of the
t-duality group sl(2, z) sl(2, z). the full t-duality group survives the decoupling limit
and is identied as the group of morita equivalences of the ncsym. we will concentrate
on sl(2, z) subgroup which only acts on the kahler structure. an element of sl(2, z) will
map a ncsym with rank n, twist m, coupling gy m , period , non-commutativity , and
background ux , to its morita equivalent dual with parameters n, m, gy m , , , and 
according to

c + d
a + b

(a.12)

where a, b, c, and d are integers dening the element of sl(2, z). one can verify that the
transformations of m and  are consistent with (a.8). the sl(2, z) invariance of the entropy
(a.11) follows immediately from the transformation of  and the fact that n transforms
according to

n =

(a + b)

,

(a.13)

which implies together with (a.12) that the entropy is indeed invariant. the momentum
and the electric ux quantum numbers are also exchanged under the sl(2, z)

(a.14)

note that a ncsym with  = r/s for relatively prime integers r and s and  = 0 is

morita equivalent to an osym with

n = sn,

g2

by choosing c = r, d = s, and taking b = q to be the solution of

qr = (1 mod s).

(a.15)

(a.16)

the solution of (a.16) is uniquely determined by requiring q/s to take on values between
zero and one. for r = 1, this is solved by q = 1 which is the case described extensively in
sections 2.1 and 2.2. this is the precise statement of equivalence between the ncsym and
the twisted osym when  is a rational number.
