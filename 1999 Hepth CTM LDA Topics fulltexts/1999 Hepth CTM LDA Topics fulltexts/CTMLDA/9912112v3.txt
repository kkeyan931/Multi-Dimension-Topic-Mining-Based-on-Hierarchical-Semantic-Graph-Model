abstract

the reductions of conformal eld theories which lead to generalized
abelian cosets are studied. primary elds and correlation functions of
arbitrary abelian coset conformal eld theory are explicitly expressed
in terms of those of the original theory. the coset theory has global
abelian symmetry.

in this paper we study the conformal eld theory based on the generalized

coset construction [1, 2]

k(m) = l(m)  lu(m), m  z,

(1)

where l(m) , lu(m) are virasoro generators and lu(m) are quadratic in
ane u(1)d currents. (for a review see [3, 4]).

when l(m) are given by sugawara construction for the ane lie alge-
bra g we have the g/u(1)d, 1  d  rank g, coset. the su(2)/u(1) theory

is equivalent to the zk invariant parafermion theory whose studies were ini-
tiated by fateev and zamolodchikov [5]. various aspects of g/u(1)d coset
theories for arbitrary simple g were investigated in refs.[6-10].

there are many other conformal models which have u(1)d ane subalge-
bras and can be reduced to coset (1).the class of such models includes n = 2
superconformal algebras [11], n-extended superconformal algebras [12, 13] ,
non-semi-simply ane-sugawara constructions [14, 15] and other. classical
algebras with virasoro generators (1) were studied in ref.[16].some currents
of the reduced n = 2 and w sl(3)
algebras were obtained in ref.[17]. as well
as the original models the reduced ones can be used as building blocks in
string theories. therefore it is important to investigate their properties.

the object of this paper is to construct a class of primary elds of (1) and
corresponding correlation functions in terms of the original theory based on
l(m). to nd the primary elds we use their transformation properties under
coset conformal algebra. solving corresponding equations we express primary
elds of (1) in terms of the original primary elds and u(1)d currents. this
enables us to express correlation functions in terms of the original ones.all
the coset elds under consideration commute with the heisenberg algebra
generated by non-zero modes of u(1)d and form (non-trivial) representations
of u(1)d. as a concequence of this construction we obtain a new realization
of zk invariant parafermion currents.

let  be the (super)algebra which has the virasoro and u(1)d subalgebras

[l(m), l(n)] = (m  n)l(m + n) + c(cid:20) 1

12

(m3  m)(cid:21) m,n,

(2)

[j i(m), j j(n)] = kmijm,n,

[l(m), j i(n)] = nj i(m + n),

where m, n  z and 1  i, j  d; c and k are the central charges.

let gh(w) be the primary eld of  which satises the equations

[l(m), gh(w)] = wm+1wgh(w) + h(m + 1)wmgh(w),

[j i(m), gh(w)] = wmtigh(w).

2

here h is the conformal dimension of gh(w) and ti is the (reducible) repre-
sentation of the generators of u(1)d for the eld gh(w).

gh(w) can be decomposed in the set of one-dimensional irreducible rep-
h(w) = pgh(w) be the irreducible component

resentations of u(1)d. let g
of gh(w) which satises the equation

[j i(m), g

h(w)] = iwmg

h(w).

here p is the projector and  = (i) is the weight. as well as gh(w) the
eld g

h(w) is primary with respect to virasoro algebra (2)
h(w) + h(m + 1)wmg

h(w)] = wm+1wg

[l(m), g

h(w).

(3)

correlation functions of these elds can be computed using correlation func-
tions of primary elds of 

< g1

h1 (w1) . . . gn

hn(wn) >=

pi < gh1(w1) . . . ghn(wn) >

n

yi=1

we shall use the following properties of the vacuum state |0 >

< 0|j i(m < 0) = j i(m  0)|0 >= 0.

(4)

the operator lu(m) is given by

lu(m) =

1
2k

d

xi=1

: j i(m  n)j i(n) :.

the normal-ordering symbol : : means that negative modes of the currents
are on the left. the operators lu(m) satisfy virasoro algebra (2) with the
central charge c = d and

[lu(m), j i(n)] = nj i(m + n).

we shall use the relation

[lu(m), g

h(w)] =

1
k

wm+1 :   j(w)g

h(w) : +

(m + 1)wmg

where

: j i(w)g

h(w) := xm<0

j i(m)wm1g

h(w) xm0

j i(m)wm1.

the coset generators k(m) (1) satisfy virasoro algebra (2) with the cen-

tral charge c  d and

[j i(m), k(n)] = 0.

(6)

this equation suggests that all the elds of the coset model commute with
j i(m). however, the primary elds g
h(w) which we present in this paper
commute only with the heisenberg algebra generated by j i(m), m 6= 0,

[j i(m), g

h(w)] = 0

and transform under u(1)d as

[j i(0), g

h(w)] = i g

h(w),

(7)

(8)

eqs.(6) and (8) express the fact that the coset theory has global abelian
symmetry.

by the denition the coset primary eld g

h(w) satises the equation

[k(m), g

h(w)] = wm+1w g

h(w) + h(m + 1)wm g

h(w),

where h is the conformal dimension of g
here we give a solution of this equation

h(w) .

to check (9) we have the following computations

it is easy to check that g

h(w) also satises eqs. (7) and (8).

the original primary eld g

h(w) can be expressed as follows

g

h(w) = (u 

<(w))1 g

h(w) (u (w))1 .

computations show that

u

h(w) = g

(11)

from this, eqs.(4) and (7) it follows that the n point coset correlation
function can be written as

< g1

h1(w1) . . . gn

hn(wn) >=< g1

h1(w1) . . . gn

hn(wn) > yi<j

(wi  wj)

i j
k .

in the case of su(2)/u(1) this relation was obtained in ref. [5].

using eqs.(7) and (11) one can nd the operator product expansion of

two coset primary elds

g1

h1(z) g2

h2(w) = (z  w)

k u 1

< (z)u 2

< (w)g1

h1(z)g2

h2 (w)u 1(z)u 2 (w).(12)

as an example let us consider the su(2)/u(1) coset.the su(2) algebra is
generated by the currents e+(w), e (w) and j(w) which satisfy the operator
product expansions

e+(z)e+(w) = reg.,
k

e+(z)e (w) =

j(z)j(w) =

+ reg.,

(13)

e (z)e (w) = reg.,

2j(w)
z  w

(z  w)2 +
(z  w)2 + reg.

k

the su(2)/u(1) virasoro generator k(w) is given by

k(w) = xm

k(m)wm2 = lsu(2)(w)  lu(1)(w),

(14)

where

lsu(2)(w) =

lu(1)(w) =

2(k + 2) (cid:16): j(w)j(w) : + : e+(w)e (w) : + : e (w)e+(w) :(cid:17) ,

: j(w)j(w) : .

2k

the current j(w) = pm j(m)wm1 has unit conformal dimension with re-
spect to lsu(2)(w) = pm lsu(2)(m)wm2 and lu(1)(w) = pm lu(1)(m)wm2

[lsu(2)(m), j(n)] = [lu(1)(m), j(n)] = nj i(m + n).

according to eq. (10) the coset currents are given by

2

e+(w) = e
e (w) = e

2

k q<(w)e+(w)e
k q<(w)e (w)e

2

2

k q>(w)w

2

k j(0),

k q>(w)w

2

k j(0).

these elds are closely related with z operators for su(2) [18, 19].

using eqs. (12-14) one can check that the currents

1(w) = (1/k) e+(w),

1 (w) = (1/k) e (w)
+

(15)

satisfy the parafermion algebra of ref. [5]

1(z)+

1 (w) = (z  w)2+ 2

k  i +

k + 2

k

k(w)(z  w)2 + o(cid:16)(z  w)3(cid:17)! ,

where k(w) is given by (14).eqs. (15) give a new realization of the parafermion
currents 1(w) and +

1 (w).

i would like to thank j.lepowsky for useful correspondence.
