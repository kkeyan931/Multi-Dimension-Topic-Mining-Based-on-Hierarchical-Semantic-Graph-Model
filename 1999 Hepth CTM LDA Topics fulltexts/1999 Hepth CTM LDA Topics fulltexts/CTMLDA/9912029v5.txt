1 introduction

d-branes give us various nonperturbative informations of string theories. one of them is the

d-brane instanton eect [1]. euclidean d-branes wound around nontrivial cycles which are the

solutions of equation of motion of worldvolume action contribute largely to the path integral

(or its counterpart of string theory), and give corrections to amplitudes or low energy eective

action. the way to calculate instanton eects by using eective action is discussed in [1, 2]

and stringy calculation is presented in [3]. so far bps d-branes are used to calculate instanton

eects. however, various non-bps stable d-branes are discovered recently. (for reviews see

[4].) since these are stable they give large contributions to the path integral similarly to bps

d-branes.

in this paper we argue non-bps d0-brane instanton eects in type i string theory as an

example of such eects. non-bps d0-brane has so(32) spinor charge and is a counterpart of

perturbative massive so(32) spinor states in heterotic so(32) theory [5]. this brane forms

a long multiplet of supersymmetry and therefore is non-bps. however, so(32) spinor charge
protect it from decay. its tension is 2 times larger than that of bps d-branes in the weak
coupling regime, and is modied as the coupling constant grows. therefore instanton action

is a complicated function of dilaton. since we do not know this function we restrict ourselves

to the weak coupling regime.

non-bps d-branes have more fermion massless modes living on them than bps d-branes

and we need more vertex operators to saturate their zero modes as will be seen in a concrete

example. hence non-bps d-brane instanton corrections are higher order eects than that of

bps d-branes.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we briey review the non-bps d0-brane

and discuss general properties of its instanton eects. in section 3, we review the supereld

formalism of type i string theory and construct the eective action and fermion vertex op-
erators following [6]. in section 4, we consider s1 compactication as a simple example and

calculate some simple amplitudes by using the eective action constructed in section 3. section

5 contains some discussions.

2 non-bps d0-brane instanton

non-bps stable d0-brane in type i string theory can be constructed from d1-d1 system

through the tachyon condensation mechanism [5] and has no rr charge. therefore its bound-
ary state has nsns part only and the overall factor is 2 times that of bps d-brane [7, 8]:

(1)
this factor 2 means that the tension of non-bps d0-brane is 2 times larger than that of
bps d-brane:

|d0i = 2|ns + ns+i .

td0 =

1
2 

2 

1

gs

.

(2)

here the factor 1
2 comes from the orientifold projection and gs is the string coupling constant.
this value is valid in the weak string coupling regime and is corrected as the coupling constant

grows, unlike bps d-branes. in the strong coupling regime the d0-brane corresponds to the

perturvative massive states with so(32) spinor charge of dual heterotic theory. their tension

, where the right hand side is written in terms of the quantities of

(mass) is

2

het

= q 2

gs

type i theory. thus the exact tension is expressed in terms of an unknown function f (gs):

f (gs)  1

gs

as

td0 = 12 f (gs),
gs  0,

f (gs)  2
gs

as

gs  .

(3)

since we do not know what f (gs) is, we restrict ourselves to the weak coupling regime.

the massless modes living on the d0-brane are scalars x m corresponding to ten spacetime
directions, one majorana-weyl spinor  as a superpartner of x m, and a fermion i with a
so(32) vector index i [7]. x m and  come from d0-d0 strings and i from d0-d9 strings.
quantization of zero modes of i gives so(32) spinor charge.

non-bps d0-brane is stable only when it is alone. when there are two d0-branes, they
attract each other since there is no rr repulsive force and are pair-annihilated. this can be

seen from the fact that the corresponding k-theory group is z2 [9]. the presence of branes
of other type also destabilizes the conguration for the same reason as above. (nsns force

derived from cylinder amplitude vanishes only when the number of directions with neumann

boundary condition on the one end and dirichlet on the other is four. (see e.g.

[10].) but

there are some exceptions when some spacetime directions are compactied. for example, when two

d0-branes are placed on the antipodal points of s 1 respectively, this conguration is stable.

2

there are no branes which can make such congurations with a d0-brane in type i string

theory.)

if a direction transverse to a d0-brane is compactied with the radius r, it decays to a
2 . this can be understood by keeping track of the construction

d1-d1 system for r < q 

given in [5] and also by the following argument.

if there is some tachyon mode on a brane, then it is unstable. we can see whether there
are any tachyon mode or not by computing the cylinder and mobius amplitude. their sum a

if the exponent of e 2

and represents the contribution of tachyon. therefore for r < q 

 r2w2t+t in eq. (4) is positive, then this factor is divergent as t  
2 the d0-brane is unstable.

since d0-brane is stable for suciently large transverse radius, it gives large contribution

to the path integral as a kind of instanton backgrounds. in order to give nite contribution,

it must be euclidean and wrapped around some compactied direction. for example, a d0-
brane wrapped once around s1 with radius r gives the instanton action exp(td0  2r) =
exp( 2r2gs
) at the weak coupling regime. the sum of its cylinder and mobius amplitude a
is

this shows that there is no tachyon mode and the winding d0-brane is stable. as for multi-
instanton congurations, though these are unstable as explained above, the d0-branes are
innitely massive in the weak coupling regime and stable approximately. therefore these

congurations can give large contributions to the path integral in the weak coupling regime.

d0-brane instanton eects give corrections to the low energy eective action of type i

string theory. d0-brane has more fermion massless modes than bps branes and therefore

more fermion zero modes. we have to insert more vertex operators in order to soak up these

zero modes. hence its leading contribution appears in higher derivative terms in the bulk

eective action than that of bps branes. in type i string theory the bps d-brane with the

lowest worldvolume dimension is d1-brane and its instanton eects appear when at least two

dimensions are compactied. but the d0-brane instanton eects emerge even when only one

dimension is compactied. in the following sections we use the eective action of d0-brane to

calculate the instanton eects.

3 the eective action and vertex operators for non-bps

d0-brane

in this section we briey review the supereld formalism of type i string theory and construct

the eective action and vertex operators of d0-brane following [6]. the results of this section

will be used in the next section. we use the notation and results of [11].

to describe type i string theory we need supervielbein e a

m a , rr
2-form bm n , and so(32) gauge eld am . supertorsion t , supercurvature r, and eld
strengths h  db and f  da satisfy the bianchi identities:

a = 0,
dh = c1trf 2,

df = 0.

and we set

we can determine the lower components of e a

solutions of bianchi identities and the denitions of t , r, h and f in the appropriate gauge

(46)

(47)

where  is the dilaton.

now we construct the eective action of d0-brane following [6]. when we do not take
account of i, the action has only the born-infeld part and does not have the chern-simons

part:

sbi = 

1

2 z d 

5

4q a

  a,

(48)

 =  z m e a

where  a
action is proportional to e when we use the string metric.

m and z m = (x m, ). the exponent of  is determined so that this

sbi does not have -symmetry since it does not have chern-simons term. therefore the
spacetime supersymmetry is spontaneously broken completely. worldsheet dieomorphism is
the only local symmetry which sbi has. the number of physical modes of  is twice that of
bps d-branes because of the absence of -symmetry.

now we take account of i. in addition to sbi, we need the following term.

s = z d

1
2

ii(ij    z m (am )ij )j .

(49)

this is determined by requiring invariance under worldsheet dieomorphism and so(32) gauge

transformation. the total action s is the sum of sbi and s. substituting eq.(24), (25), (26),
(27), (33), (34), and (35) into s we get

sbi =

(57)

similarly we can construct the vertex operators of graviton, dilaton, and rr 2-form. these

vertex operators are used for calculating instanton eects following [1, 2].

4 a simple example

in this section we consider s1 compactication and some amplitudes as a simple example of

non-bps d0-brane instanton eects using the prescription given in [1, 2]. we discuss the low

energy and large radius regime in order to calculate instanton eects by the eective action,

as explained in [2]. we do not keep track of the overall normalization of the amplitudes since

it cannot be determined by this method.

let us take the background geometry s1  r9 (gmn is at,  is a constant and other elds
are zero). we choose x 9 as the coordinate of s1 and set the radius r. substituting eq.(40),

(43) and (44) to eq.(48) and (49) we get the d0-brane action in this background:

s = 

1

2 z d eq( x m   (m))( xm   (m)) +z d

1
2

ii  i . (58)

here we are using the string metric.

let us consider an euclidean d0-brane winding around s1. if we choose the static gauge,

then

x 9 = r,

0    2.

(59)

the action up to the quadratic order becomes

s =

the zero modes are the constant modes of x i,  and i. the zero modes of x i represent
the position of the d0-brane in r9. to soak up the fermion zero modes we must insert 16 s

and 32 s.

in the at background the vertex operators of  

9 (x i), (x i), (x i) and a9(x i) become

  (9),

(v)9
(v)  ,
(v)ij
(va)9ij  ij ,

  (9)ij ,

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

where we ignored the coecients.

the simplest amplitudes saturating the fermion zero modes are as follows.

 16 v insertions

this gives the following correction to the eective action.

(65)

 16 (va)9, n v and 16  n (v)9 insertions

this gives the following correction to the eective action.

)

(66)

we can consider the compactication on higher dimensional torus similarly to the above

analysis. in this case the d0-brane is unstable if the radius of the direction transverse to it is

suciently small, as explained in section 2. but we do not have to consider this fact since our
discussion is restricted to the large radius (r  ) regime.

9

5 discussions

we calculated the instanton eects by the eective action. of course we can consider stringy

calculation by using the rule given in [7]. in this case we must be careful with the instability

of the d0-brane caused by suciently small radius of the direction transverse to it.

the d0-brane corresponds to the perturbative massive modes of heterotic so(32) theory.

it is interesting to calculate the eect corresponding to the d0-brane instanton eects in the

heterotic side, though quantitative comparison with the results in type i side is dicult since

these are not protected from the string coupling correction.

type i string theory has non-bps stable d(1)-brane besides d0-brane [9]. its instanton
eects exist even in at ten dimensional spacetime. the properties of d(1)-brane are similar
to the d0-brane. it is interesting to calculate these eects.

instanton eects correct the low energy eective action. it may be possible to determine
the exact tensions of d0 and d(1)-brane by completing the action supersymmetrically and
identifying the instanton actions.
