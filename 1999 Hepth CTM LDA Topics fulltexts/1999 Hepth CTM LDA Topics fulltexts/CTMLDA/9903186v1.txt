abstract

we consider type 0b d3-branes placed at conical singularities and analyze in
detail the conifold singularity. we study the non supersymmetric gauge theories
on their worldvolume and their conjectured dual gravity descriptions.
in the
ultraviolet the solutions exhibit a logarithmic running of the gauge coupling. in
the infrared we nd conning solutions and ir xed points.

1 introduction

the type 0 string theories have worldsheet supersymmetry but no space-time super-
symmetry as a consequence of non-chiral gso projection [1, 2]. consider two types
of such string theories, type 0a and type 0b. they do not have space-time fermions
in their spectra. nevertheless, they have a modular invariant partition function. the
bosonic elds of these theories are as those of the supersymmetric type iia and type
iib string theories, with a doubled set of ramond-ramond elds. in addition they
contain a tachyon eld t .

type 0 theories have d-branes. as in the type ii case, one can consider the gauge
theories on the worldvolume of n such branes. these theories do not contain an open
string tachyon [3]. moreover, the bulk tachyon can condense due to its coupling to the
ramond-ramond elds.

one example studied in [4, 5, 6, 7] is the theory on d3 branes in type 0b theory.
since there is a doubled set of rr 4-form elds in type 0b string theory, the d3 branes
can carry two charges, electric and magnetic. the worldvolume theory of n at electric
d3 branes is a u(n) gauge theory with six scalars in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group.

asymptotic solutions of a proposed dual gravity background were constructed in [4].
at large radial coordinate the tachyon is constant and one nds a metric of the form
ads5  s5 with vanishing coupling which was interpreted as a uv xed point. the
solution exhibits a logarithmic running in qualitative agreement with the asymptotic
freedom property of the eld theory [5, 6]. moreover the sign of the second coecient
of the -function was found to be in agreement with eld theory [5].

at small radial coordinate the tachyon vanishes and one nds again a solution of the
form ads5  s5 with innite coupling, which was interpreted as a strong coupling ir
xed point [5]. the complete gravity solution describing the ow from the uv xed
point to the ir xed point has not been constructed yet.

generically one expects the gauge theory to have dierent phases parametrized by
the possible couplings. the ir xed point should occur as a particular tuning of the
couplings. indeed, other solutions at small radial coordinate were constructed in [7]
that exhibit connement and mass gap. moreover they were argued to be more generic
than the ir xed point solution.

one can construct other non supersymmetric theories by placing the type 0b d3
branes at singularities.
in this paper we will pursue this direction. we will mostly
consider the theories obtained by placing type 0b d3 branes at a conifold singularity,
but we will also discuss general features applicable to other singularities as well. the
paper is organized as follows.
in the next section we will comment on the phase
structure of the worldvolume theory of n at electric d3 branes of type 0b string

theory and the dual gravity description. the discussion will apply as well to branes at
singularities which will be studied later. in section 3 we will place type 0b d3 branes
at a conifold singularity. we will consider electric branes, magnetic branes and self-
dual branes. we will discuss the worldvolume eld theory and construct conjectured
dual gravity descriptions. these exhibit uv freedom and a logarithmic running of
the gauge coupling. however, we will see that the sign of the two-loop -function
coecient is not captured correctly by gravity. in the ir we nd gravity solutions that
correspond to xed points as well as solutions that exhibit connement. in section 4 we
will discuss type 0b d3 branes placed in general singular spaces. section 5 is devoted
to a discussion on the rg ow from the uv to the ir in the gravity description.

2 comments on phase structure

in the following we make some comments that will be relevant later too, on the theory of
n at electric d3 branes of type 0b string theory. the theory is a non supersymmetric
su(n) gauge theory with six real scalars x i, i = 1, ..., 6 in the adjoint representation of
the gauge group. the classical action is derived by a dimensional reduction of the pure
su(n) gauge theory action in ten dimensions. the six scalars are the components of
the gauge elds in the reduced dimensions.

the theory has classically so(6) global symmetry that rotates the six scalars. this
allows three possible parameters: a gauge coupling gy m , a mass parameter for the
scalars m and a scalar quartic potential coupling g. in the classical action, the mass
parameter is zero and g is xed in terms of gy m . quantum mechanically, the three
parameters are corrected dierently and can take independent values. the theory
has a phase diagram depending on these three parameters. generically we expect to
see in the diagram coulomb-like (higgs) phases, connement phases and maybe non
trivial rg xed points arising from particular tuning of the parameters. for instance,
such a picture has been seen on the lattice for su(2) gauge theory with one scalar
in the adjoint representation [8, 9, 10]. one starts with the theory with three bare
parameters, the gauge coupling, a mass parameter for the scalar and a scalar quartic
potential coupling. the phase diagram is constructed by tuning the bare parameters
to dierent values and taking the continuum limit. the case with six scalars in the
adjoint representation has not been analysed on the lattice yet.

we may expect, like in the case with one scalar, that the vacuum expectation value
for the scalars will vanish in the conning phase and be non zero in the higgs phase.
a non trivial xed point may appear on the border of these phases at zero vacuum
expectation value for the scalars. since the gravity description that we consider corre-
sponds to d3 branes on top of each other, the vacuum expectation value for the scalars
is zero. we expect to see then a conning phase and maybe ir xed points.

2

the electric d3 branes theory is conjectured to have a dual string description. there
are two approximations of the dual description that can be taken. when the eective
string coupling e is small string loops are suppressed and we can use the classical
string description. when the  corrections are small the classical gravity description
is applicable.

the gauge theory is asymptotically free. at short distances the theory is weakly
coupled and we expect the dual gravity description not to be valid. this can happen
for instance if the gravity background is singular as in the models based on heating
up theories in one higher dimension [11, 12]. in the case at hand the signal for the
gravity description being non adequate is that the  corrections are of the same order
as the leading order gravity contributions [5]. for large n the curvature in string units
is small but  corrections associated with the weyl tensor are not suppressed. the
eective string coupling is small and therefor we expect the classical string description
to be applicable. this still has an advantage over the nite temperature case in that
we can see qualitatively the asymptotic freedom property already in the leading order
gravity description. in [5] it was argued that the gravity description at large radial
coordinate captures the right sign of the one and two loop  function coecients.

the gravity description cannot capture quantitatively the renormalization group
ow from the uv to the ir. for the electric d3 branes there is a gravity solution that
indicates an ir xed point at innite coupling. while the  corrections are suppressed
in this region, the dilaton is large and classical string theory is not sucient to study the
xed point theory. the gravity solution at all energy scales u has not been constructed
yet. other gravity solutions with a conning behaviour in the ir were found in [7] and
will be discussed in the following.

the ansatz for the background metric (in string frame) is [4]

where , ,  are functions of the radial coordinate   1/u4 and  denotes the dilaton
eld. the tachyon eld t induces a change in the dilaton eld in the radial coordinate .
this corresponds to the running of the gauge coupling in the gauge theory. dierent
forms of the tachyon elds as a function of  induce dierent rg trajectories from
the uv to the ir. changing the form of the tachyon eld and as a consequence of the
equations of motion changing the form of , ,  is analogus to changing the parameters
gy m , m, g. in analogy with the lattice picture, we expect the gravity description to
exhibit dierent phases parametrized by the form of , ,  and t .

the mapping of parameters between the eld theory and gravity cannot be made
quantitatively precise. one can see, however, that ,  together with  control the size
of the s5 part of the metric (1). one expects that the signal for the scalars in the
adjoint representation being massive is the shrinking of the ve sphere to zero size.

done as in [13, 14], by minimization of the action of a string with worldsheet bounded
by the loop. the theory is in a conning phase if the g component of the metric
(4) does not vanish anywhere. in particular it must not vanish as   . the rea-
son is that the string tends to minimize its length by going to the region with the
smallest possible value of g, it will stay there for most of the geodesic and then will
go up to the position of the other external charge [15, 16]. therefore the energy is
proportional to the distance of the charges and the string tension is min(g()) up to
a numerical constant. on the other hand if there is a zero at the horizon there are two
possibilities: either the quark antiquark potential is coulombic [13, 14] or the energy is
minimized by two straight strings which can be separated without cost of energy which
corresponds to electric screening. in [7] it was observed that the second possibility is
realized for backgrounds of the form (2). thus, the background (4) corresponds to a
phase with electric screening for 0 < 1 and to a conning phase for 0  1. using
calculations along the lines of [12, 7] one can show the existence of a mass gap in the
conning phase. the radius of the ve-sphere is controlled by 0 + 1  22. when
this quantity is negative the sphere shrinks to zero size in the ir which signals that
the scalars are massive and that the theory may be in the same universality class as
su(n) yang-mills theory. these solutions at large  have not been connected to the
uv region at small  yet. with a vanishing tachyon at large ,  and  approach a
constant value and there is a large  solution of the form ads5  s5 that signals the
ir xed point discussed above [5].

an important issue in the gravity description is the tachyon instability [4]. a possible
mechanism for removing it employs the rr elds of type 0 theories, since the eective

4

action contains the terms

sef f  z g(cid:16)m2e2t 2 + f 2t 2(cid:17) ,

(5)

where f is the rr ve form eld strength. the coupling of t and f in (5) can shift
the eective tachyon mass to be positive. assuming the overall scale of the metric
s|f|2 > o(1). since f  n we get
to be (gsn)1/2 results in a stability condition g2
s l2
gsn < o(1). therefor the stability condition appears to hold for small bare t hooft
coupling which is the correct limit to take in order to get to the continuum theory.
the same conclusion applies to the cases where the branes are placed at singularities
which we will study next.

3 d3 branes in conifold background

in this section we will study the theory obtained by placing type 0b d3 branes at a
conifold c.

3.1 field theory

when placing n d3 branes of type iib string theory at a conifold it is argued [17] that
the resulting worldvolume theory is n = 1 supersymmetric su(n)  su(n) gauge
theory with chiral superelds ak, k = 1, 2 transforming in the (n, n ) representation
and bl, l = 1, 2 transforming in the ( n, n) representation. in the ir the theory ows
to a non trivial xed point with the superpotential w = t
2ijklt raibkajbl becoming
exactly marginal.

electric or magnetic d3 branes

on the worldvolume of n electric d3 branes of type 0b string theory at a conifold
we expect a truncation of the fermions, namely, an su(n)  su(n) gauge theory
with complex scalar elds ak, k = 1, 2 transforming in the (n, n) representation and
bl, l = 1, 2 transforming in the ( n , n) representation. classically the theory has
su(2)  su(2)  u(1) global symmetry which can be viewed as inherited from the
n = 1 supersymmetric theory upon truncating the fermionic elds. one su(2) acts
on ak and the other su(2) acts on bl. the u(1) charges of ak and bl are opposite.
with this global symmetry there are several possible bare parameters. let us as-
sume the the matrices ak, bl are diagonal in some basis. there are two gauge couplings
2t rbl bl and several possible quar-
gy m1, gy m2, two possible mass terms m2
tic couplings g1t r(ak ak)2, g2t r(ak ak)(bl bl), g3t r(bl bl)2 and squares of the mass

terms. however, the eigenvalues ak, bl of the matrices ak, bl respectively parametrize
the positions of the n d3 branes at points in conifold and are related by the equation
dening the conifold, ak ak = bl bl modulo the u(1) action. this leaves us with one mass
parameter m and one quartic coupling g. by symmetry argument one can identify the
bare gauge couplings parameters which we will call gy m .

where b1 and b2 are the one-loop and two-loop beta functions coecients. the one-
loop -function coecient is b1 = 3n and the theory is asymptotically free. with the
two equal gauge couplings the two-loop -function coecient at large n is b2 = 2n 2.
therefor, unlike the theory of n electric d3 branes in at space, here b2
9 > 0.
2b2
as we will see later, while the gravity description captures the asymptotic freedom
property of this theory it does not capture correctly the sign of the two-loop -function.
the theory has a phase diagram depending on the three parameters gy m , m, g. we
expect to see in the diagram coulomb-like phases, connement phases and maybe non
trivial rg xed points arising from particular tuning of the parameters.

the worldvolume theory of n magnetic d3 branes of type 0b string theory is the

same as that of n electric ones.

self-dual d3 branes

the theory of n self-dual d3 branes consists of n electric and n magnetic d3
branes. the worldvolume theory of n self-dual d3 branes at a conifold is a gauge
theory with gauge group su(n)4. the matter content consists of 8n 2 complex scalars
and 12n 2 weyl fermions. their representation can be deduced as in [18]. the 8n 2
complex scalars transform in the bi-fundamental representations

2(cid:16)(n, n, 1, 1)  ( n, n, 1, 1)  (1, 1, n, n)  (1, 1, n, n)(cid:17) ,

and the weyl fermions in

2(n, 1, n, 1)  2( n , 1, n, 1)  2(1, n, 1, n)  2(1, n, 1, n)
(n, 1, 1, n)  ( n , 1, 1, n)  (1, n, n, 1)  (1, n, n, 1) .

(7)

(8)

the fermions arise from the open strings stretched between the electric and the mag-
netic branes [19].

the worldvolume theory is asymptotically free. we will see that the gravity picture
indicates that for zero vacuum expectation value for the scalars the theory ows in the
ir to a xed point.

which indicates a uv xed point. the eective string coupling vanishes at innite u
and the corresponding gauge theory has a vanishing coupling in accord with the uv
freedom of the theory.

in fact, it follows from the equations (15) and can be seen from the solutions (18) that
we can identify  = 2 up to a constant term. with such an identity the whole metric

8

can be rewritten as a ve dimensional metric times the metric of the t 1,1 manifold
multiplied by a  dependent function. as we will discuss in the next section this is an
example of a general feature, namely the eective gravity solution has the form of a
ve dimensional space whose form is universal times a ve dimensional einstein space
(with a warp factor). the relevant equations of ,  and  are universal and do not
depend on the background in which we put our d3 branes.

for d3 branes in at space the numerical values of the two loop beta function in
eld theory and gravity do not agree, but the sign matches. the sign dierence the
b1 and b2 coecients was taken as an evidence that the eld theory may run to an ir
xed point.

as in [5], from the form of the dilaton we can read o the running of the gauge

thus, for the conifold model neither the numerical values agrees nor the sign. this, as
we will see later, is not special to the conifold model and generically one cannot trust

suppressed and the classical string description is applicable. for large q the curvature
in string units is small too. however, the  corrections associated with the weyl ten-
sor are of the same order as the leading gravity contribution. therefor the classical
gravity description is not applicable. indeed it does not lead to a quantitatively correct
running of the gauge coupling.

in the ir limit u  0 the tachyon vanishes and the metric in the einstein frame
describes ads5  t 1,1. the eective string coupling is innite in this limit. therefore
the solution indicates an ir xed point at innite gauge coupling. the classical string
description is not sucient in order to describe the xed point. however, away from
the xed point it can provide a good description since e  1/q which is small for
large number of branes. in the ir the curvature in string units is small and the 
corrections are suppressed. we expect therefor that classical string theory can provide
a good description of the whole ow from the uv to the ir besides the xed point
itself

in the gauge theory we expect that a ne tuning of the bare parameters is needed
to get to the xed point. in the supergravity this ne tuning corresponds to a ne
tuning of the constants of integration of the ir solution to match the uv solution. in
particular we do not expect this ne tuning to be the generic solution.

connement

to nd solutions to (15) in the ir that exhibit connement we will consider also the
quartic part of the tachyon eld potential (14). consider the case when the tachyon
condenses at a non zero value t0 and the tachyon potential (14) obeys the constraint
g (t0) = 0. this implies the tachyon is exactly constant and does not run. for example
one could take f (t ) = 1 + t + t 2/2 and g(t ) = t 2/2  t 4/4 with t0 = 1 but the
precise form of the tachyon potential is not important.

in this case an asymptotic solution for large  is given, up to exponentially suppressed

corrections, by

  0 + 0,

  0 + 1,

  0 + 2 .

the zero energy condition (13) imposes the constraint

(22)

(23)

the conditions i  0, i = 0, 1, 2 together with (23) guarantee that the corrections
from exponential term in the equations of motion (15) are suppressed.

with the parametrization (22) the einstein frame metric (9), written in the string

frame, takes the form

to analyze the phase of the corresponding gauge theory as a function of the gravity
parameters i we can use the wilson loop as an order parameter. the discussion is
similar to that in section 2. the background (24) corresponds to electric screening for
0 < 1 and to a conning phase for 0  1. the radius of the t 1,1 is controlled by
0 + 1  22. when this quantity is negative the sphere shrinks to zero size in the
ir which signals that the scalars are massive and that the theory may be in the same
universality class as su(n)  su(n) yang-mills theory. note that although in this
case the form of the metric is the same as (4) when the ve-sphere shrinks to zero size,
we expect the functions i to dier since the corresponding gauge groups are dierent.

3.2.2 (p, q) d3 branes

magnetic d3 branes

consider p magnetic d3-branes placed in a conifold singularity. the discussion will
be brief since it is very similar to the electric case. we consider the tachyon potential

this is precisely the xed point electric d3 branes solution, except the sign of tachyon.
this is due to the sign change of the tachyon tadpole when we go from the electric to
the magnetic d3-brane [4].

when considering the tachyon potential (14) with the quartic part. we can nd, as

in the electric case, solution that exhibit connement in ir.

self-dual d3 branes

consider now placing n self-dual d3-branes at a conifold singularity. we will use
the metric ansatz (9) with h(t ) given by (12). the function h(t ) has an extremum
at t0 = 0 and the tachyon equation is solved by t = 0 with a constant dilaton  = 0

this solution has the form ads5t 1,1, which indicates that the ir physics of this large
n brane system is governed by a xed point. note that unlike the self-dual d3-branes
in at space studied in [18], here the theory is asymptotically free. in particular, the
self-dual d3-branes theory can be obtained as an orbifold of n = 4 theory by a discrete
subgroup of the z4 center of the r-symmetry group su(4) [20]. this is not the case
with self-dual d3-branes at a conifold singularity.

4 d3 branes in general backgrounds

what we learned from the previous section is that the supergravity equations for the
elds , t ,  and  do not depend, at least to the order we checked, on whether we put
d3 branes in a at background or near a conifold. in the following we will check this
for general backgrounds of the form m4  y6 where m4 is at minkowski space which
corresponds to the d3 brane worldvolume and y6 is a non-compact space which is at
or may have a singularity at the origin. the space y6 is a cone over a ve-dimensional
compact manifold x5 which is called the horizon. we will consider solutions that in
the uv and the ir take the form ads5  x5. for generic values of r the background
will be a bration of x5 over a ve-dimensional space i.e.
the metric of the x5 is
multiplied by a radial dependent warp-factor.

we will consider the following ansatz for the metric and the four-form gauge eld:

the einstein equations arising from variations with respect to the metric components
with x5 indices give one part which is proportional to the ricci tensor plus terms that
are proportional to the x5 metric. so in general the metric of the horizon has to obey
the following equation

rij = cgij ,

(32)

where i, j are x5 indices. it is easy to see that we can make the choice c = 4 or in
other words x5 can always be chosen to be an einstein space. note that a dierent
choice of the constant c can be absorbed by constant shifts in ,  and . well known
examples of einstein spaces are s5 in the case of a at background, the homogeneous
spaces t p,q and del pezzo surfaces.

this is similar to what happens in type iib theory with the same background. the supergravity
equations yield the same harmonic function for the d3 branes f = 1 + q/r4 as in a at background.
in the type 0 the functions  and  take over the role of the harmonic function f and do not depend
on the geometry of the horizon as well.

13

in all these cases the equations will be of the form (15) with  = 2 (up to a constant)
and asymptotic solutions will take the form (18), (21) up to possible constant shifts in
,  and .

this means that in general backgrounds of the form m4  y6 we will nd solutions
that correspond to asymptotically free theories in the uv, and there will always exist
a solution in the ir which describes a non-trivial conformal xed point at innite
coupling. we can also construct in the ir a large class of conning theories with
massgap along the lines of section 3.3. one important issue is whether there is a
gravity description of the ow from the uv to the ir. this will not be in general the
case, as we will discuss in the next section.

note that in view of the above discussion the two-loop beta function determined by
the gravity description is independent of the gauge theory we have on the branes and
is universal.

5 discussion

besides the type 0 examples, there are by now several gravity solutions discussed in the
literature that may provide a dual description of conning non supersymmetric gauge
theories [11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24]. in all of them the gravity solution cannot provide a
quantitative description.

in the following we will discuss the issue of nding solutions in the eective type
0 gravity theory that describe qualitatively the whole rg ow from the uv to the
ir. to be specic we discuss the case of electric branes in at space, but in view of
the previous section the discussion is similar for branes at singularities. on the uv
side we found a good candidate solution that exhibits asymptotic freedom which has
a description in terms of classical string theory. using numerical methods we tried to
continue the known asymptotic solution in the uv to the ir. in the case of zero quartic
coupling t = 0 we found that the tachyon goes from t0 = 1 through an oscillatory
region and settles down at zero. unfortunately the numerical approximation fails at
that point and one is not able to trust the numerical method and go beyond.

the other possibility is to start with one of the ir solutions (the ir xed point
or the conning solutions) and proceed to the uv. whereas starting from the ir
xed point one runs into similar numerical problems as for the uv solution, starting
with a conning solution in the ir, which is the most generic situation in eld theory,
produced the most promising results. in this case we chose t = 1/4 such that g (t0) = 0
and the tachyon does not run and is constant t0 = 1 all along the ow.
in this
situation we were able to nd solutions connecting the ir to the uv but these solutions
depend strongly on the integration constants i, 0, 0, 0. in some cases , ,  settle

14

down at constant values in the uv which corresponds to a space time with geometry
r+  r4  s5. the eld theory interpretation of such a solution in the uv is missing.
in other cases one or several of the functions diverge, but we were not able to identify
a solution in the uv that asymptotes ads5  s5 and behaves like the uv solution.
still, the good behaviour of the solutions we found gives us some condence that
such a solution exists, but the integration constants have to be chosen carefully. a
generic conning solution in the ir in general does not connect to a uv solution with
asymptotic freedom. to further pursue this direction requires a better understanding
of the relation between the eld theory parameters and the integration constants.
