abstract

it is shown that the modulus of any graded or, more generally, twisted kms
functional of a cdynamical system is proportional to an ordinary kms state
and the twist is weakly inner in the corresponding gnsrepresentation. if the
functional is invariant under the adjoint action of some asymptotically abelian
family of automorphisms, then the twist is trivial. as a consequence, such
functionals do not exist for supersymmetric cdynamical systems. this is in
contrast with the situation in compact spaces where super kms functionals
occur as super-gibbs functionals.

1 introduction

graded kms functionals play a prominent role, both, in physics and in mathematics.
in physics they are used as a tool in the construction of supersymmetric quantum
eld theories in a thermal background [5, 6]. in mathematics they appear as a basic
ingredient in noncommutative geometry, notably in the context of connes cyclic
cohomology [3, 7, 8] and of the witten index [11].

it is the aim of the present article to exhibit in the general setting of cdynamical
systems some elementary properties of graded (or, more generally, twisted) kms
functionals which seem to have escaped observation so far.

the rst part of our analysis is complementary to the work of stoytchev [9],
who proved that any normal, faithful and symmetric functional on a von neumann
algebra is a graded kms functional with respect to the action of some involution
and some canonically associated (modular) automorphism group. we will show here
in the calgebraic setting that the modulus of any twisted kms functional is a
multiple of an ordinary kms state and the twist is weakly inner in the corresponding
gnsrepresentation.

this structure is familiar from numerous concrete examples of supersymmetric
dynamical systems in compact space. but, as is shown in the second part of our
article, it disappears if one adds the assumption that the twisted functional is in-
variant under the action of some asymptotically abelian family of automorphisms,
which is typical of innite systems (thermodynamic limit). namely, the twist be-
comes trivial in this case and the functional satises the ordinary kms condition. it
is a simple consequence of this result that such functionals cannot be accommodated
in supersymmetric theories.

these results provide further evidence to the eect that thermal systems can
be supersymmetric only in compact space. for if the spacetime admits a group of
symmetries shifting points spacelike to innity, then supersymmetric thermal states
can never be homogeneous with respect to that action.

that supersymmetry is extremely vulnerable to thermal eects in innite systems
was rst pointed out in a model independent setting in [1], where it was shown that
supersymmetry is necessarily broken in all spatially homogeneous kms states. these
results were carried over to a calgebraic setting and generalized in [2].

the present results show that graded kms functionals, which are frequently taken
as building blocks in the construction of supersymmetric models, would not only break
supersymmetry if one proceeds to the thermodynamic limit [1], they simply cease
to exist. some implications of this observation for the study of innite dynamical
systems are discussed in the conclusions.

2 twisted kms functionals

let a be a unital c*-algebra,  a one-parameter automorphism group acting on a,
and  an automorphism of a. thus (a, ) is a (not necessarily continuous) c

2

dynamical system and  denes a twist on a. we are primarily interested in the case
 2 = id, i.e. where  is a z2-grading on a, but it will be useful not to assume this
from the outset.

we shall say that a bounded, linear (not necessarily positive) functional  on a
is a -twisted kms functional (or simply a twisted kms functional) if, for any given
a, b  a, there exists a complex function fa,b  a(s) with

fa,b(t) = (t(a)b)

fa,b(t + i) = ((b)t(a)) ,

t  r .

(1)

here a(s) is the set of bounded continuous functions on the strip s  {0  z  1}
which are analytic in the interior of s. in physics the width of the strip s has the
meaning of inverse temperature which we have normalized here to 1 for convenience.
the same argument as for ordinary ( = id) kms states implies that a -twisted
kms functional  is -invariant: since fa,1(t) = fa,1(t + i) the function fa,1 extends
to a bounded entire function and therefore is constant. setting a = 1 in (1), we also
see that  is -invariant.

given a -twisted kms functional , we consider its modulus   || which is
obtained by extending  to the second dual of a and subsequent polar decomposition.
equivalently,  may be characterized [4, sec. 12.2.9] as the unique positive linear
functional on a which satises |||| = |||| and

|(a)|2  |||| (aa),

a  a .

(2)

from the latter characterization one sees that there holds |  | =    for any
automorphism   aut a. hence if  preserves , i.e.    = , then it also
preserves .

proceeding to the gnsrepresentation {, h, } of a induced by , one can
implement any automorphism  which preserves  by a unitary operators u on h.
it is determined by

u a  (a) ,

a  a .

(3)

we may assume that  is 1  1 (replacing a by a/ker if necessary), therefore,
here and in the subsequent discussion, we identify a with its image (a) under the
homomorphism  in order to simplify the notation. with this convention,  extends
to an automorphism e of the weak closure m = a given by e = ad u.
in the form (polar decomposition)

as is well known (and can be seen from (2)) the functional  can be represented

 = (u  , ).

(4)

here u  m is a partial isometry which is uniquely xed by the condition that uu
is the support projection of , i.e. the smallest projection p  m for which p = .
we consider in the following the canonical extensions of ,  to m, which are
given by e  (  , ) and e  (u  , ), respectively. the following result can be
established by standard arguments, cf. [10].

lemma 1.  is a -twisted kms functional of (m, ).

if x, y  m, there exist by kaplanskys density theorem bounded nets ai  a
proof.
and bj  a such that ai  x and bj  y -strongly. the corresponding family of
functions {t 7 (t(ai)bj)}i,j converges to t 7 e(et(x)y) uniformly on r, as can be
seen from the estimate

|(t(ai)bj)  e(et(x)y)|  ||(ai  x)u|| ||bj|| + ||(bj  y)|| ||xu|| .

(5)
here the einvariance of e , e and the polar decomposition of e have been used.
in a similar manner one sees that the family {t 7 ((bj)t(ai))}i,j converges to
t 7 e(e(y)et(x)) uniformly on r. this implies, since the maximum modulus princi-
ple holds on a(s) according to the threelinetheorem, that the family {fai,bj }i,j
converges uniformly on the strip s to some function efx,y which also belongs to a(s).
moreover, efx,y(t) = e(et(x)y) and efx,y(t + i) = e(e(y)et(x)).

(cid:3)

lemma 2. let  be a -twisted kms functional of (a , ). if  is positive, then
 = id and e is an ordinary positive kms functional of (m , e).
proof. as  is positive it coincides with its modulus and the associated partial
isometry u  m satises u = . we shall show next that  is separating for m.
let u(t) = eiht be the oneparameter unitary group implementing et, cf. relation
(3), and let v be the unitary operator implementing e. according to lemma 1, the
functional e is a etwisted positive kms functional for (m , e). now if x  m is
such that x = 0, then also et(x) = 0, hence, making use of formula (1), we have
for all y  m

x = 0  e(e(y)et(x)) = (ue(y)et(x), ) = 0

 e(xy) = 0  (y, x) = (uxy, ) = 0  x = 0 .

(6)

thus x = 0  zx = 0  xz = 0 for all z  m, hence x = 0. as an immediate
consequence of this observation we have u = 1. it remains to show that e = id.
let it be the oneparameter modular group associated with m and . as  is
u(s)invariant and es(m) = m, the unitary groups it and u(s) commute. thus
there exists a dense subalgebra m0  m such that m0 is a core both for  and eh.
by the kms property for the modular group we have

(x, y ) = (yx, ) = (xy, ) = (y, x) ,

x, y  m0 .

(7)

on the other hand, by the twisted kms condition, we have

(x, y ) = (yx, ) = (e(x)ehy, ) = (ehy,e(x))

= (ehy, v x) = (v ehy, x) ,

x, y  m0 .

(8)

hence  = v eh and, by the uniqueness of the polar decomposition for closed linear
operators,  = eh and v = 1, i.e. e = id.
(cid:3)

lemma 3. let  be a twisted kms functional of (a, ) and let  = (u  , ) be
its polar decomposition. then u is unitary and  is separating for m.
proof. we begin by noting that u is left xed both by e and e because of the
invariance of e and e under the adjoint action of these automorphisms and the
uniqueness of the polar decomposition. now, for eanalytic elements x  m the
twisted kms condition for e can be expressed as

(9)
replacing x with ux and using the einvariance of u as well as the fact that uu is
the support projection of e, we can proceed to

e(uei(x)y) = e(ue(y)x) .

(10)
setting x = u and y = u in this formula we get, taking into account that e(u) = u,
(11)

e(ei(x)y) = e(ue(y)ux) .

e(1) = e(uu) = e(uuuu) = e(uu) ,

hence uu = uu =  by the limit case of the schwartz inequality.

we shall show now that  is separating for m, and this will follow as above by
showing that x = 0 for x  m implies x = 0. so let x  m satisfy x = 0.
then e(yet(x)) = (uyet(x), ) = 0 for all y  m. hence by equation (1) we have
(ue(x)y, ) = e(e(x)y) = 0 and this implies e(x)u = 0 or equivalently, since
e(u) = u, that xu = 0. as uu is the support projection of e we conclude that
xu = xuuu = 0 and consequently xuu = 0. but uu = , so it follows that
x = 0, i.e.  is separating. hence uu = uu = 1.
(cid:3)

we mention as an aside that the above result allows one to disintegrate a twisted

kms functional into factorial twisted kms functionals.

proposition 4. let  be a twisted kms functional of (a, ) and let  = (u  , )
be its polar decomposition. then e is inner on m, indeed e = ad u, and e is an
ordinary positive kms functional for (m, e).
proof. since u is unitary we have e  ad u  e  aut m, so formula (10) shows that
e is a etwisted kms functional of (m, e). (we recall that this formula amounts to
relation (1) for e-entire elements x  m; that it entails relation (1) for all elements
of m can be shown by similar arguments as in the proof of lemma 1.) as e is
positive, we conclude from lemma 2 that e = id. hence e is an ordinary positive
kms functional and e = ad u.
corollary 5. if   aut a preserves the twisted kms functional  of (a, ), then

(cid:3)

e commutes with e and e.
proof. since e(u) = u by the uniqueness of the polar decomposition of , the com-
mutativity of e and e follows from the preceding result. as e is the modular group
associated with (m, ), it is also clear that e commutes with e.

3 twisted asymptotic abelianess

we shall specialize now to the class of cdynamical systems (a, ) for which there
exists a family of automorphisms acting on a in a (twisted) asymptotically abelian
manner. this situation prevails in physics if one deals with innite systems (thermo-
dynamic limit). as a matter of fact, the dynamics  itself is asymptotically abelian
in generic cases.

given a -twisted kms functional of (a, ), we shall say that a sequence of

automorphisms n  aut a is -asymptotically abelian if   n =  and

lim
n

(c[a, n(b)]) = 0

for all a, b, c  a .

(12)

here the twisted commutator is dened by [a, b]  ab  (b)a.

lemma 6. let  be a -twisted kms functional of (a, ). if there exists a asymp-
totically abelian sequence n  aut a, then [x, en(y)]  0 weakly for all x, y  m.
proof. since ([a, n(b)], cu) = (c[a, n(b)]) and the set of vectors cu, c  a,
is dense in h (recall that u is a unitary in m = a), it follows from condition (12) that
the (bounded) sequence [a, n(b)] converges weakly to 0. thus [a, n(b)]  0 weakly
because all weak limit points of [a, n(b)] are elements of m and  is separating for
m by lemma 3.

as the unit ball a1 of a is -strongly dense in the unit ball m1 of m by kaplanskys

density theorem, given x, y  m1 and  > 0, there exist a, b  a1 with

||x  a||, ||x  a||, ||y  b||, ||y   b|| <  .

(13)

now for any xed z  m

1 we have

|([x, en(y)], z)  ([a, en(b)], z)|

 |(cid:0)(xen(y)  aen(b)), z(cid:1)| + |(cid:0)(e(en(y))x  e(en(b))a), z(cid:1)| .

(14)

the rst term in the right hand side of the above inequality can be estimated by

|(cid:0)(xen(y)  aen(b)), z(cid:1)|  |(cid:0)(x  a)en(y), z)| + |(aen(y  b), z(cid:1)|
 |(en(y), z(x  a))| + |(en(y  b), za)|  2kk2 ,

(15)

where, in the last step, we used the fact that en preserves . similarly, the second
term on the right hand side of (14) is bounded by 2kk2.
since  is arbitrary, this entails ([x, en(y)], z)  0, hence, as the set of vectors
m  is dense in h and  is separating for m, we conclude that [x, en(y)]  0 weakly
for all x, y  m.

(cid:3)

6

proposition 7. let  be a -twisted kms functional of (a, ). if there exists a -
asymptotically abelian sequence n  aut a, then e = id and e is an ordinary kms
functional of (m, e).
proof. as noticed above, there holds en(u) = e(u) = u by the uniqueness of the

polar decomposition of . thus, by the preceding lemma,

xu  ux = xen(u)  en(u)x = xen(u)  e(cid:0)en(u)(cid:1)x = [x, en(u)]  0

(16)
weakly for all x  m. so u belongs to the center of m and, as e = ad u by
proposition 4, e is trivial.

(cid:3)

let us now assume that e 2 = id. note that this is always the case if the twisted

kms functional  is selfadjoint, i.e. (a) = (a), a  a. for then

e(ua) = (a) = (a) = e(ua) = e(au) = e(ua),

(17)
where in the last equality we made use of the fact that e is a kms functional and
et(u) = u. thus u = u since e is faithful, hence e 2 = ad u2 = id. a twisted
kms functional is called graded kms functional if e has the latter property.
given a graded kms functional  of (a, ), let man  m be the weakly dense
algebra of eanalytic elements and let

a  a ,

e0  i

d

dtet|t=0

(18)

(19)

(20)

be the generator of e, which has man as a core. the dynamical system (a, ) is said
to be supersymmetric if there exists a closable odd derivation e : man  man such
that

here by an odd derivation we mean a graded derivation, i.e.

e 2(a) = e0(a) ,

a  man .

e(ab) = e(a)b + e(a)e(b) ,

a, b  man ,

which is odd, i.e. e e = e e on man. note that the condition of supersymmetry

for a cdynamical system is somewhat weaker than the condition of supersymmetry
since the existence of supersymmetry transformations is only required in the repre-
sentation induced by .

corollary 8. let  be a graded kms functional of the supersymmetric cdynam-
ical system (a, ). if there exists a asymptotically abelian sequence n  aut a,

then e = 0, e = id, and e is a trace.
proof. by proposition 7, e is an ordinary kms functional and the grading e is
trivial. since e is odd, it follows that e = e = 0 on man, hence e0 = 0 because of
equation (19) and the fact that man is a core for e0. thus e = id, hence by the kms
property we conclude that e is a trace on m.

4 conclusions

in the preceding analysis we have determined the form of graded kms functionals
of dynamical systems in a quite general setting and we want to discuss now some
implications of our results for the study of innite systems.

in order to x ideas, let us assume that we are dealing with a family of graded
dynamical systems (a, , ) which are assigned to compact subsets   rn and
which determine in the limit   rn some dynamical system (a, , ) on which
spatial translations act in an asymptotically abelian manner. this situation is familiar
from quantum eld theory, where one frequently constructs rst the theory in a nite
volume (box)  and then proceeds to the thermodynamic limit.

for the nite volume theory one expects that the graded kms functionals gener-
ically give rise to type i representations. they can then be presented in the familiar
gibbs form,

(  ) = tr e h v 

,

(21)

where e h is the density matrix of the gibbs ensemble at inverse temperature
 and v the unitary which implements the grading and commutes with the box
hamiltonian h. if   rn, the representation (21) is no longer meaningful, how-
ever, since the limit of e h is in general not a trace class operator. so the question
arises in which sense a thermodynamic limit of graded gibbs functionals can be
dened.

from the point of view of physics it might seem natural to normalize the func-
tionals, i.e. to proceed from  to ||||1 . the normalized functionals could then
be interpreted as weighted dierences of bosonic and fermionic ensembles [6] and
the existence of (weak*) limits would follow from standard compactness arguments.
that this idea does not work in general can be seen if one thinks of the situation
where one has a unique kms state for given , for example at high temperatures
 1. then the limit functionals are invariant under the spatial translations. but this
is in conict with proposition 7 according to which the grading would have to be
trivial, unless the limit is zero. so this approach does not seem viable.

the other obvious idea is to normalize the functionals by xing the value of (1)
(the index), assuming that it is dierent from 0. but then the norms |||| cannot
stay bounded; for otherwise one would come, as above, to the conclusion that the limit
points of the functionals  are zero in general, in conict with their normalization.
hence in this approach one has to deal with unbounded sequences of functionals and
it is not clear from the outset how a reasonable limit can be dened in these cases. to
the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been solved so far in any nontrivial
example.

from a mathematical point of view the second approach through unbounded
functionals seems nevertheless attractive. for it provides a natural generalization of
the concept of graded kms functionals to the class of asymptotically abelian c
dynamical systems. the unboundedness would not be an obstacle to the denition

8

and analysis of entire cyclic cocycles for such systems, should the functionals be
continuous with respect to some auxiliary banach algebra norm.
it is less clear,
however, how such unbounded functionals can be interpreted in physics.
