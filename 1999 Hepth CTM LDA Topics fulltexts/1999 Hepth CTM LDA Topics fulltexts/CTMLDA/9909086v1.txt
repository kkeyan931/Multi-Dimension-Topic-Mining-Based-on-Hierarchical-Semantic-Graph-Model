abstract

in a wide class of d-dimensional spacetimes which are direct or semi-direct sums
of a (dn)-dimensional space and an n-dimensional homogeneous internal space,
a eld can be decomposed into modes. as a result of this mode decomposition, the
main objects which characterize the free quantum eld, such as green functions and
heat kernels, can eectively be reduced to objects in a (dn)-dimensional spacetime
with an external dilaton eld. we study the problem of the dimensional reduction
of the eective action for such spacetimes. while before renormalization the original
d-dimensional eective action can be presented as a sum over modes of (d  n)-
dimensional eective actions, this property is violated after renormalization. we
calculate the corresponding anomalous terms explicitly, illustrating the eect with
some simple examples.

1 introduction

simplications connected with an assumption of symmetry play an important role in
the study of physical eects in a curved spacetime. in this paper we consider quantum
elds propagating in a d-dimensional spacetime which is a semi-direct sum of a (d  n)-
dimensional space and an n-dimensional homogeneous internal space. such a eld can
be decomposed into modes. as a result of this mode decomposition, the main objects

which characterize the free quantum eld, such as green functions and heat kernels,
can eectively be reduced to objects in a (d  n)-dimensional spacetime with an external
dilaton eld. our aim is to study the problem of the dimensional reduction of the eective
action for such spacetimes. we shall demonstrate that while before renormalization the
original d-dimensional eective action can be presented as a sum over modes of (dn)-
dimensional eective actions, this property is generically violated after renormalization.
we call this eect the dimensional-reduction anomaly.

first of all, there is an evident general reason why d-dimensional renormalization is
not equivalent to renormalization of the (dn)-dimensional eective theory. namely, the
number of divergent terms of the schwinger-dewitt series which is used to renormalize
a given object depends on the number of dimensions. what is much more interesting is
that this is not the only reason for the presence of the dimensional-reduction anomaly.
the aim of this paper is to discuss this problem and to derive explicit expressions for
the dimensional-reduction anomaly in a four-dimensional spacetime with special choices
of one- and two-dimensional homogeneous internal spaces.

in some aspects the problem we study is related to the study of the momentum-
space representation of the ultraviolet divergences discussed by bunch and parker [1].
nevertheless, there exists a very important dierence. namely, bunch and parker used the
fourier transform with respect to all d dimensions (d = 4 in their paper) in a spacetime
without symmetries. we are making mode decompositions with respect to n internal
dimensions only. moreover, due to the symmetry we eectively rewrite the original d-
dimensional theory in terms of a set of (dn)-dimensional eective theories with a dilaton
eld. this representation, which was absent in the paper by bunch and parker, allows us
to make the comparison of renormalization in d- and (d  n)-dimensional theories.
the dimensional-reduction anomaly discussed in this paper might have interesting ap-
plications. one of them is connected with black-hole physics. recently there has been
much interest in the study of the hawking radiation in two-dimensional dilaton gravity
models of a black hole. this study was initiated by the paper [2].
in this and other
[3][5]) it is either explicitly or implicitly assumed that
papers on the subject (see e.g.
two-dimensional calculations (at least for the special choice of the dilaton eld correspond-
ing to the spherical reduction of the four-dimensional schwarzschild spacetime) correctly
reproduce the s-mode contribution to the stress-energy tensor of the four-dimensional
theory. generally speaking, in the presence of the dimensional-reduction anomaly this is
not true.

it is interesting to note that in a numerical study of the vacuum polarization in black
holes where the mode decomposition was used, it has been demonstrated that one always
needs to add extra contributions to the terms of the series in order to ensure convergence
of the series (see e.g. [6, 7, 8]). this fact, as we shall see, is a direct manifestation of the
dimensional-reduction anomaly.

the paper is organized as follows. section 2 contains a general discussion of the
dimensional reduction of a free quantum eld theory in a gravitational background. in
section 3 we discuss simple examples of the dimensional reduction of four-dimensional at
spacetime and illustrate the eect of the dimensional-reduction anomaly. in sections 4
and 5 we derive the dimensional-reduction anomaly for h 2iren and h t 
 iren in a four-
dimensional spacetime for (3 + 1) and (2 + 2) reductions. we discuss the obtained results
in the conclusion. in our work we use dimensionless units where g = c = h = 1, and the
sign conventions of [10] for the denition of the curvature.

2 dimensional reduction of the heat kernel and the

eective action

consider a d-dimensional spacetime with a metric of the form

ds2 = g dx  dx  = dh2 + e(4/n)d2 ,

x  = (xa, yi) ,

 = (xc) ,

dh2 = hab(xc)dxadxb ,

d2 = ij(yk)dyidyj ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where d2 is the metric of an n-dimensional homogeneous space.
in other words, the
metric ds2 is a semi-direct sum of dh2 and d2. we call the n-dimensional space with
metric d2 the internal space, and the scalar eld (xc) on the (d  n)-dimensional
manifold with metric dh2 the dilaton eld. let us emphasize that the normalization of
the dilaton eld  is a question of convenience. we x this normalization by requiring

that g for the metric (2.1) be proportional to exp(2) for any number of internal

dimensions n. well-known examples of metrics of the form (2.1) are those of spherical
spacetimes, and metrics connected with a dimensional reduction in kaluza-klein theories.
let  be a free scalar quantum eld propagating in the spacetime (2.1) and obeying

the equation

with eld operator

f (x) = 0 ,

f =   v  m2 .

(2.3)

(2.4)

note that we explicitly separate the mass term m2 from the potential v . the latter may
contain an interaction with the curvature, r, for a non-minimally coupled eld, but is
not xed at the moment. we only assume that when calculated on the background (2.1)
the potential v is independent of the ya coordinates.

using the line element (2.1), the operator  becomes

 = h  2   + e(4/n) ,

(2.5)

where h,  are the dalembertians corresponding to the metrics hab, ij respectively,
and  is understood to denote the covariant derivative with respect to the metric hab.
fact that for a wide class of homogeneous metrics the eigenvalue problem

considerable simplication of the problem in spacetime (2.1) is connected with the

y (y) = y (y) ,

(2.6)

is well-studied. we denote by yw harmonics, that is eigenfunctions of (2.6), and use a
(collective) index w to distinguish between dierent solutions of (2.6) for the same . we
assume standard normalization and orthogonality conditions,1

z dy ||1/2 yw (y) yw (y) = w w  ,
yw (y) yw (y) = (y, y)  ||1/2n(y  y) .

(2.7)

(2.8)

xw

1we write summation over indices assuming that the spectrum is discrete. for a continuous spectrum
one must replace summation by integration over the spectrum. in what follows we shall assume that this
rule is automatically applied.

3

we denote by n () the degeneracy of the eigenvalue , that is n () = pw,w  w w .

the eld  can be decomposed into modes

where the functions p obey the equation

ep(x)yw (y) ,

fp(x) = 0 ,

f = h  v[]  m2 .

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

the index p is an additional quantum number which enumerates solutions for a given 
and v[] is

v[] = e(4/n) + ()2  h + v .

(2.12)

in other words, by expanding the eld in modes we eectively reduce the original d-
dimensional problem to a similar problem in (d  n)-dimensional space with an eective
potential v depending on the dilaton eld .
it is not dicult to show that at least formally the eective action for the quantum
eld (2.3) allows a similar dimensional reduction. in order to demonstrate this, consider
a heat kernel k(x, x |s) for the problem (2.3), which is the solution of the equation

  
s  f! k(x, x |s) = 0 ,

k(x, x |s = 0) = d(x, x ) = e2(x) (dn)(x  x)

h

n(y  y)



.

the eective action is dened as

w = 

1

2 z 

0

ds
s

trxk(x, x |s) .

here and later the trace operation is understood as

trxa(x, x ) = z dxg a(x, x) = z dxhz dy e2(x) a(x, y; x, y) .

by decomposing k(x, x |s) into harmonics one can write

k(x, x |s) = e(x)+(x) x,w k(x, x; |s) yw (y) yw (y) .

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

using relations (2.5)(2.8), it is easy to verify that the reduced heat kernel k(x, x; |s)
obeys the relations

  
s  f!k(x, x; |s) = 0 ,

k(x, x; |s = 0) = (dn)(x, x) =

(dn)(x  x)

h

.

(2.18)

(2.19)

here the operator f is given by (2.10)(2.11).

4

substituting representation (2.17) into the eective action (2.15), integrating over the

y-variables, and using (2.7), one gets

(2.21)

(2.23)

(2.22)
and n () is the degeneracy factor of the eigenvalue . relations (2.20)(2.21) can be
interpreted as the mode decomposition of the eective action.
it should be emphasized that the above relations for the eective action are strictly
formal because of the presence of ultraviolet divergences. in order to obtain the renor-
malized value of the eective action in d-dimensional spacetime one must subtract from
trxk(x, x |s) the rst nd terms of the schwinger-dewitt expansion of the heat kernel,
where

d
2 + 1 for d even,
d+1

for d odd.

nd = 


our main observation is that this procedure destroys the formal representation (2.20), so
that after renormalization one gets

w ren = x n () [w ren

 + w] .

(2.24)



is understood as the renormalized eective action of the (d  n)-
in this expression w ren
dimensional theory with a dilaton eld, (2.10), where the renormalization is performed
by subtracting the rst ndn terms of the schwinger-dewitt expansion for the operator
f. we call the additional contribution w the dimensional-reduction anomaly. a
representation similar to (2.24) is also valid for h 2iren,
h 2iren = e2x n ()hh 2iren

 + h 2ii .

(2.25)

one might observe that there exists a relationship between the dimensional-reduction

anomaly and the so-called multiplicative anomaly [11, 12]. formally, we can write

f = y,w f ,
2 x

1

2



log det f = 

n() log detf .

(2.26)

(2.27)

the latter relation is nothing but (2.20). the violation of the formal relation (2.27) for
products of operators after renormalization is known as the multiplicative anomaly.

the aim of this paper is to discuss special examples of the dimensional-reduction
anomaly. in what follows, we restrict ourselves to the physically interesting case where
the number of spacetime dimensions is 4, and the number of dimensions of the inter-
nal homogeneous space is 1 or 2. we also restrict ourselves to manifolds of euclidean
signature. in each case the anomaly is found as the dierence between the renormaliza-
tion terms for the (d n)-dimensional theory and the mode-decomposed renormalization
terms from d dimensions.

3 flat space examples of the dimensional-reduction

anomaly

the dimensional-reduction anomaly can occur in even the simple case of mode decom-
position in a at spacetime. in order to demonstrate this, let us consider a free massive
scalar eld  obeying the equation

f  = (  m2)  = 0

(3.1)

in four-dimensional at euclidean space. the euclidean green function for this equation
is

g0(x, x ) =

m

422

k1(m2) ,

(3.2)

where 2 is the square of the geodesic distance from x to x , and k1 is a modied bessel
if there exists a boundary  surrounding the region m under consideration
function.
and the eld obeys a non-trivial boundary condition at , or equation (3.1) includes a
non-vanishing potential v which vanishes in m, then the green function would dier
from g0. we denote this green function by g(x, x ). the renormalized green function
in this case is dened as2

gren(x, x ) = g(x, x )  g0(x, x ) .

(3.3)

we also have

x x

gren(x, x ) .

h 2(x)iren = lim

(3.4)
it is evident that h 2(x)iren = 0 in the absence of the external eld v and boundaries.
in this section we derive the dimensional-reduction anomaly in h 2iren for two examples
of mode decompositions in at space.
in each case, the anomaly is calculated as the
dierence between the subtraction terms used to renormalize the green function g of the
dimensionally-reduced theory, and the g0 used to renormalize the four-dimensional green
function g. these calculations are easily repeated for the heat kernel, allowing one to
obtain the anomaly in the eective action in a similar manner.

3.1 spherical reduction

for the rst example we consider the case when the external eld and/or boundary is
spherically symmetric and perform decomposition into spherical harmonics. the metric
in spherical coordinates x  = (t, r, , ) is given by

2in a generic four-dimensional curved background, one has to subtract the rst two terms in the

where t = t  t, r = r  r, and

where i+1/2 is a modied bessel function. since for   1 the expression in the right-hand

 (x, x) vanish
for all  when either r = 0 or r = 0. this property will be of some importance for the
anomaly.

until now we were working with the series representation for the four-dimensional
green function g0. on the other hand, one can start with the two-dimensional theory
dened by (3.9). in order to calculate the two-dimensional quantity h 2(x)if
ren for the
two-dimensional operator f, one subtracts from the green function g(x, x) the free-eld
green function3, and takes the coincidence limit:

h 2(x)if

ren = lim

[g(x, x)  g div

 (x, x)] ,

where the two-dimensional free-eld green function is

is identical to the rst term in the rst sum for g0

relation (3.20) explicitly demonstrates that h 2(x)if

ren can be expressed as a sum over
modes of h 2(x)if
ren from the corresponding two-dimensional theory. however, to obtain
the correct result we see that each term in the decomposition must be modied by adding
the state-independent quantity h 2(r)i of (3.21). failure to account for these extras
terms would result, for example, in a nonzero value for h 2(x)if
ren in the minkowski state.
the violation of the expected mode decomposition for a physical observable in the
process of dimensional reduction due to the renormalization procedure is called the
dimensional-reduction anomaly.
in this particular example the dimensional-reduction
anomaly is given explicitly by (3.22). there are several reasons why this anomaly arises.
first, the number of divergent terms which are to be subtracted in the renormalization

3 in two dimensions, renormalization consists of subtracting only the rst term of the schwinger-
dewitt expansion of the heat kernel for the operator f.
in at spacetime this is equivalent to the
subtraction of the free-eld green function, even in the presence of the dilaton eld and a nontrivial
potential v .

8

procedure is dierent in 4 and 2 dimensions (see the footnotes on pages 6 and 8). how-
ever, it is easily shown that even if we make an additional subtraction of the next term
of the schwinger-dewitt expansion in two dimensions, for   2 there remains a non-
vanishing local part of the dimensional-reduction anomaly which is given by the rst
sum in (3.22), with k  2. besides this local contribution, in our particular case there
is a non-local part to the anomaly given by the second sum. it is present because the
two-dimensional (t, r) space is a half-plane and the two-dimensional eld vanishes at the
boundary r = 0. while the mode-decomposed subtraction term g0
 from four dimensions
obeys this boundary condition, the two-dimensional subtraction term g div

 does not.

3.2 rindler space

as a second example of the dimensional-reduction anomaly in at spacetime we consider
the decomposition of a scalar eld into rindler time modes. the metric for (euclidean)
rindler space is given by

ds2 = z2dt2 + dz2 + dx2 + dy2 ,

(3.24)

where t  [0, 2), z  [0,), x, y  (,). this line element may be obtained from
the at-space line element

ds2 = dt 2 + dx 2 + dy 2 + dz 2

(3.25)

by the coordinate transformation

t = z sin(t) , x = x ,
z = z cos(t) , y = y ,

(3.26)

and is clearly just at space in polar coordinates. hence, the free-eld green function is
given by (3.2) with

2 = (x)2 + (y)2 + (z)2 + 2zz [1  cos(t)]

(3.27)

this green function may be decomposed in terms of the rindler time modes cos(kt)
as an ordinary fourier cosine series,

the physical observable of interest, h 2if

ren, can be calculated from the green function
g(x, x ) in the presence of a t-independent boundary or potential using (3.3, 3.4). de-
composing g in the same manner as g0 then allows us to write a decomposed form for

once again, the anomaly is seen as the dierence in the subtraction terms used to renor-
malize the higher- and lower-dimensional theories. it is easily shown that (3.41) falls o
as o(z1) for large mz, and diverges as o(z1) when mz  0 for k 6= 0. for k = 0 the
anomaly is nite as mz  0.
these results are qualitatively very similar to those from the spherical decomposition
of at spacetime in the previous section. this should not be surprising, considering that
the euclidean rindler space (3.24) is simply at space in polar coordinates. as a result,
the calculations of this section amount to a one-dimensional spherical decomposition of
at spacetime.

4 the dimensional-reduction anomaly for h 2iren

in the previous section we examined the dimensional-reduction anomaly for mode decom-
positions in at space.
in the next two sections we extend these calculations to more
general, curved spaces. while our chief aim is the study of the dimensional-reduction
anomaly in the eective action, in order to illustrate more clearly the eect of curvature
on local reduction anomalies we begin with the simpler case of the anomaly for h 2iren.
at this point some conventions on notation are in order. henceforth the scalar eld op-
erator in four dimensions is denoted by f , and its green function is gf . the calligraphic
symbols f and gf represent the corresponding quantities in the dimensionally-reduced
theory. in both cases the subtraction terms for renormalization are identied by the sub-
script ()div (rather than ()0 as in the previous section). also, the mode decomposition of
gf

div will be denoted by gf

div() to distinguish it more clearly from gf
div .

4.1

(1+3)-reduction

we begin with the case n = 1 and write the metric (2.1) in the form (a, b = 1, 2, 3)

ds2 = g dx  dx  = e4(x)dt2 + hab(x)dxadxb .

(4.1)

we assume that t  (,), corresponding to a zero-temperature state. the scalar
eld operator is taken to be f =   v  m2, where the potential v is independent of
euclidean time t. it is easy to see that the operator  for the metric (4.1) is 2/t2.
hence, the mode decomposition in terms of its eigenvalues is simply the standard fourier
transform with

for a general four-dimensional space, the divergences of the green function in the coinci-
dence limit come from the rst two terms of the schwinger-dewitt expansion of the heat
kernel,

for x = x and small e2(t  t) for the metric (4.1) are
clearly, the green function and schwinger-dewitt coecients depend on the form of
the eld equation. we make this dependence explicit by providing such quantities with
a corresponding superscript. the superscript for the an does not include the mass term
from the operator f , as it is accounted for separately in (4.4). we also include a cut-o
parameter  in the exponent of the integrand in (4.4) which ensures convergence of the
integral for small s for a vanishing value of .

our purpose is to compare the divergences of four- and three-dimensional theories
related by a fourier time transform. unfortunately, it is not possible to evaluate the
fourier transform of (4.4) exactly for general hab. our response is to make point splitting
in the t-direction, expanding all t-dependent quantities in powers of the curvature, and
truncating all expressions at rst order in the curvature (two derivatives of the dilaton or
metric). denoting   e2(t  t) and putting x = x we have up to rst order in the

here and later we use the notation  = e2. the quantity h 2i
 is that part of
the anomaly which dominates at high frequency ; it consists of all terms of o(1)
and higher in the large- expansion of h 2i. these are the terms which diverge in the
integration over , and hence which lead to the divergences in the four-dimensional green
function as t  t  0. the part of the anomaly that remains when h 2i
 is subtracted

of h 2i
it should be emphasized that, generally speaking, the procedure of determining the
fourier transform for the point-split divergent part of the green function is not unique.

 is nite as t  t  0.



4the symbol  (sharp) is borrowed from musical notation to denote the high-frequency part of the

anomaly; the remainder is labelled with  (at).

14

the short distance schwinger-dewitt expansion guarantees us only the correct reproduc-
tion of terms which are singular in the coincidence limit t  t  0. for this reason,
only the high-frequency part h 2i
 which is responsible for the short distance behavior
div(t, x; t, x) in four dimensions is a universal function. a particular form of the low
of gf
frequency part of the anomalous term, h 2i
, may depend on the concrete form of the
continuation of gf
div(t, x; t, x) for large separation of points t and t. our choice (4.13),
though not unique, possesses a number of pleasant properties. first of all, in a at space-
time it is identical to the green function of the scalar eld for both the massive and
massless cases. moreover, the reduction anomaly obtained by using this prescription is
directly related with a so-called analytic approximation for h 2if
ren derived in [7]. in order
to demonstrate this let us take the inverse fourier transform of h 2i
,

h 2i

performing the integration (see appendix c.2), we obtain

the parameter  is a low-frequency cut-o which is required to make the integral conver-
gent. it corresponds to a well-known ambiguity in the renormalization prescription. this
ambiguity is absent for a conformally-invariant theory, when m = 0 and the parameter of
the non-minimal coupling  takes its conformal value  = 1/6.

for the special case of a static spherically symmetric spacetime this reproduces exactly
the analytic approximation of anderson [7]. relation (4.32) also reproduces the zero-
temperature killing approximation [9] for a massless conformally-coupled eld in a static
spacetime. relation (4.32) can be considered in fact as an extension of these results to the
general case when the spacetime is static, but not necessary spherically symmetric, and
the eld equation includes an arbitrary mass and potential v . we shall discuss the origin
of this approximation, its nite temperature generalization, and its properties elsewhere
[15].

(2+2)-reduction

4.2
let us discuss now the dimensional-reduction anomaly for h 2iren for the case when the
metric of the internal space is at and two-dimensional; that is, the spacetime metric is
of the form (a, b = 2, 3)

ds2 = e2(x)(dt2

0 + dt2

1) + hab(x)dxadxb .

(4.33)

first of all, it should be noticed that this metric is a special case of the metric (4.1) when
the dilaton eld does not depend on one of the coordinates xa. equation (4.33) can be
obtained from (4.1) by rescaling the dilaton eld   /2 and putting

habdxadxb = e2(x) dt2

1 + hab(x)dxadxb .

(4.34)

for the divergent part of the four-dimensional green function expanded to rst order in
the curvature we have an expression similar to (4.13),

(4.36)

to obtain the mode decomposition of the divergent part of the green function we

make a fourier transform similar to (4.17)

here we use the vector notations p = (p0, p1) and pt = p0t0+p1t1. we also denote p2 = p2.
since the function gf
div depends only on the dierence tt, its fourier transform depends
only on p. calculating the integrals we obtain

the adopted mode expansion into plane waves exp(ipt) reduces the initial problem

dilaton-dependent potential. the corresponding wave operator fp is

fp = h  vp[]  m2 ,

(4.41)

where

vp[] = p2 + ()2  h + v .

(4.42)
the divergent part of the two-dimensional green function for the operator fp can be
obtained by using the schwinger-dewitt expansion for this operator. in two dimensions

for convenience, we give here two dierent forms of the representation for h 2ip. in the

so on are two-dimensional objects calculated for two-metric hab. in the second equality,
(4.46), the same exression is written in terms of four-dimensional objects dened for the

note that (5.13) has been written in terms of four-dimensional quantities.
it may be
shown [15] that the stress-energy tensor resulting from the variation of (5.13) in the
special case of a static, spherically symmetric spacetime coincides with the analytic ap-
proximation of anderson et al [8] for the zero-temperature case. furthermore, in the
massless, conformally-coupled limit (5.13) coincides with the zero-temperature killing
approximation [9].

(2+2)-reduction

as we already mentioned, the (2 + 2)-reduction is a special case of the static-spacetime
reduction. the calculation of the dimensional-reduction anomaly is very similar to the
calculations of the previous subsection - straightforward but quite involved. we do not
reproduce the details of these calculations here but simply give the nal results.

6 conclusion

in the presence of a continuous spacetime symmetry, when the eld equation can be
solved by decomposition of the eld into harmonics, one can easily obtain similar mode-
decomposed expressions for the eld uctuations and the eective action. each of the

20

terms in this decomposition coincides with the corresponding object (the uctuations or
the eective action) of the lower-dimensional theory obtained by the reduction. we have
demonstrated that because of the ultraviolet divergences these decompositions have only
formal meaning, as the renormalization violates the exact form of such representations.
as a result, the expression for the renormalized expectation value of the object in the
physical spacetime can be obtained by summing the contributions of corresponding
lower-dimensional quantities only if additional anomalous terms are added to each of the
modes. we call this eect the dimensional-reduction anomaly.

in the general case, there can be dierent origins of the dimensional-reduction anomaly.
in particular, such an anomaly may arise when the lower-dimensional manifold which
arises as the result of the dimensional reduction has a non-trivial topology or has bound-
aries. we demonstrated how this kind of situation arises in the simple examples of the re-
duction of four-dimensional at spacetime in spherical modes (section 3.1) and in rindler
time modes (section 3.2). in addition to these global contributions to the dimensional-
reduction anomaly, there also exist local contributions. the corresponding anomalous
terms are local invariants constructed from the curvature, the dilaton eld, and their
covariant derivatives. our main objective was the study of such local dimensional-
reduction anomalies. we derived the expressions for such anomalies for (3 + 1)- and
(2 + 2)- spacetime reductions with a at internal space. the remarkable fact that was
discovered in this analysis is that the calculated dimensional-reduction anomaly is closely
related to the analytical approximation in static spacetimes developed in [7, 8]. we shall
investigate this intriguing relationship further in a future publication [15].

the dimensional-reduction anomaly discussed in the present paper might have many
interesting applications. in particular, it may be important for calculations of the con-
tribution of individual modes with a xed angular momentum to the stress-energy tensor
and the ux of hawking radiation in the spacetime of a black hole. in the presence of
the dimensional-reduction anomaly, the results of two-dimensional calculations must be
modied by terms produced by the anomaly. we hope to return to the discussion of this
and other related topics in subsequent publications.

tion of static space

the line element for a static space may be written in the form

ds2 = e4(x)dt2 + hab(x)dxadxb .

for this static metric, hab is an induced 3-metric, and n = e2(x)

because we will be using some quantities dened in terms of the full four-dimensional met-
ric g and others in terms of the three-dimensional metric h, some conventions on notation
are in order. henceforth four-dimensional curvatures and covariant derivatives will be de-
noted by 4r and ();a respectively, while  is understood to represent the dalembertian
with respect to g. all other curvatures and covariant derivatives are understood to be cal-
culated using the three-metric h. in particular,  and ()|a are three-dimensional covariant
derivatives, and  = h is the three-dimensional dalembertian. for the dilaton  we
shall understand a, ab, etc. to denote multiple three-dimensional covariant derivatives
of .

with these conventions we have, for example,

(a.3)

it is convenient to dene the following three-dimensional tensor which occurs naturally

in the 3 + 1 reduction:

t = t a

tab = 2 [ab  2ab] ,
a = 2h  2()2i = 2 .

(a.5)

in terms of tab the only nonvanishing components of the four-dimensional curvatures are

4r0a0b = e4tab ,

4rab = rab + tab ,

4r00 = e4t ,

4r = r + 2t .

(a.7)

we shall also need the following expressions for 4r;, 4r;, 4r;, and 4r; :

4rab;c = (rab + tab)|c ,
4ra0;0 = 2e4h(rab + tab) b  t ai ,

4r00;c = e4t|c ,

4r;a = (r + 2t )|a ,
4r;ab = (r + 2t )|ab ,
4r;00 = 2e4 (r + 2t )|a a .

consider a spacetime with the line element (4.33). in this case we will be using some
quantities dened in terms of the full four-dimensional metric g, and others in terms of
the two-dimensional metric hab (a, b = 2, 3). in analogy to the (3 + 1)-splitting case,
four-dimensional curvatures and covariant derivatives will be denoted by 4r and ();a
respectively, while  is understood to represent the dalembertian with respect to g.
all other curvatures and covariant derivatives are understood to be calculated using the
two-metric hab. in particular,  and ()|a are two-dimensional covariant derivatives, and
 = h is the two-dimensional dalembertian. for the dilaton  we shall understand a,
ab, etc. to denote multiple two-dimensional covariant derivatives of . for example,
with these conventions, the four-dimensional dalembertian of a y-independent scalar s
