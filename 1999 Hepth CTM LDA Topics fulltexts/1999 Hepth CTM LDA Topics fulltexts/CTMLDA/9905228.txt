(16) rst condition impose boundary connection at. case simplify boundary variation replacing ada a3. moreover, veried r(a3a) = 0 lie algebra valued a. boundary variation reduces to: sb = 3zm 4 r(cid:18)aa + (ada + 2 3 a3)a(cid:19) . (17) also assume xed two-form boundary variation u(1) gauge potential must form = d, scalar . integrating parts using fact f (a) = 0 nd second term eq.(17) vanishes. assumed 5 admits closed invertible 2-form hence restriction boundary 4 closed. so(4, 2) connection, one may construct frame-eld compatible (lorentzian) spin-connection, upon wick rotation, provides eu- clidean structure. euclidean geometry enables construction complex structure 4 {$9805114$}. hence, using complex structure, write: sb = 3zm 4 r(aiaj ajai)ijdzi dzj dzi dzj .
