abstract

the gauged wznw model has been derived as an eective action, whose

poisson bracket algebra of the constraints is isomorphic to the commutator

algebra of operators in quantized fermionic theory. as a consequence, the

hamiltonian as well as usual lagrangian non-abelian bosonization rules have

been obtained, for the chiral currents and for the chiral densities. the expres-

sion for the anomaly has been obtained as a function of the schwinger term,

using canonical methods.

i. introduction

it is well known that in 1 + 1 dimensions there exist equivalence between fermi and bose

theories in the abelian [1] and non-abelian case [2]. in the later witten demonstrated that

free eld theory of n massless majorana fermions is equivalent to the non-linear sigma model

with wess-zumino term at the infrared-stable xed point, because both theories obey the

same kac-moody (km) algebras. the extension of this equivalence have been considered

by several authors [3]. they introduced external chiral gauge elds and showed the identity

of the eective actions which implies the identity of correlation functions.

in this paper, starting with non-abelian fermionic theory coupled with background gauge

elds, we are going to construct the equivalent bosonic theory for general gauge group. our

approach is dierent from the previous one and naturally works in the hamiltonian formalism.

we believe that it gives a simpler resolution of the problem.

the classical fermionic theory is invariant under local non-abelian gauge transformations.

consequently, the rst class constraints (fcc) ja are present in the theory and satisfy non-
abelian algebra as a poisson bracket (pb) algebra. in the quantum theory the central term
appears in the commutator algebra of the operators ja, so that the constraints become
second class (scc) which implies the existence of the anomaly [4]. these known results will

be repeated in sec. ii for completeness of the paper and in order to x our notation.

we dene the eective bosonized theory, as a classical theory whose pb algebra of
the constraints ja is isomorphic to the commutator algebra of the operators ja, in the
quantized fermionic theory. this is the way how the bosonized theory at the classical level

incorporates anomalies of the quantum fermionic theory.

in sec. iii we nd the eective action w , for given algebra as its pb algebra. the similar

problems has been considered before in the literature [5]. using the method of coadjoint

orbits, they showed that km algebra yield the wess-zumino-novikov-witten (wznw)

model. here we are going to present a new, canonical approach. we introduce the phase

space coordinate q,  and parameterize the constraints ja by them. one of the main

2

points of the paper is to nd the expressions for the constraints ja and for the canonical
hamiltonian hc in terms of phase space coordinate, satisfying a specic pb algebra. we
then use the general canonical method [6,7] for constructing the eective action w with the

known representation of the constraints. by eliminating the momentum variables on their

equations of motion we obtain the bose theory in the background elds, which is equivalent

to the quantum fermi theory in the same background. this bose theory is known as a gauged

wznw action.

in sec. iv we derive hamiltonian non-abelian bosonization rules. it is easy to obtain

the formulae for the currents, just dierentiating the functional integral with respect to the

background elds. we also derive the rules for  and 5 terms, using the approach of

this paper. note that our hamiltonian bosonization formulae for the currents depend on

the momenta, while those for mass term depend only on the coordinates. wittens non-

abelian bosonization rules can be obtained from the hamiltonian ones, after eliminating the

momenta.

in sec. v we obtain the expression for the anomaly, using canonical method. we extend

the general canonical formalism, from systems with fcc to the systems with scc where

the central term appears. we nd the expressions for the left-right, as well as for the axial

anomaly.

sec. vi is devoted to concluding remarks. the derivation of the central term, using

normal ordering prescription is presented in the appendix.

ii. canonical analysis of the fermionic theory

a. classical theory

let us consider the theory of two dimensional massless majorana fermions i (i = 1, ...n),

interacting with the external yang-mills elds a and b, with the action

s = z d2[ i   i  a

  i  b

1  5

2

] .

1 + 5

2

3

(2.1)

we can rewrite it as

s = z d2[i


 + i+

+ + i




  i++  i2(aa

+


ta + ba


+ta+)] .

(2.2)

we chose anti-hermitian matrices ta as the generators of the gauge group g, introduce
light-cone components v = 12(v0  v1) for the vectors, and write the gauge potentials as
ta. we use the basis 0 = 1 , 1 = i2 , 5 = 01 = 3, and
a+ = aa
dene the weyl spinors by the conditions 5 = . for simplicity, we write 
 and




+ta and b = ba


ta instead of pi i


and pij i


i


taijj
.

the fermionic action (2.2) is already in the hamiltonian form and we can conclude that

there are two basic lagrangian variables i


and i

+ appearing with time derivative, whose

conjugate momenta are i


= ii


. variables without time derivatives, aa

+ and ba


, are

lagrange multipliers and the primary constraints corresponding to them are the currents

ja = i


ta = ta .

(2.3)

the canonical hamiltonian density can be expressed in terms of the chiral quantities 

hc = +  

( = i





= 


) .

starting with the basic pb

{i


(), j

()} = ij(  ) ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

we can nd that pb of the currents satises two independent copies of km algebras without

central charges

{ja, jb} = fab

cjc ,

{j+a, jb} = 0 .

we also have the relations

{, ja} = ja ,

{, ja} = 0 ,

which imply

4

(2.6)

(2.7)

{hc, ja} = ja .

the total hamiltonian takes the form

ht = z d[hc + 2(aa

+ja + ba


j+a)] .

the consistency conditions for the currents

j+a = {j+a, ht} = j+a + 2fab
a + 2fab
ja = {ja, ht} = j

cbb

cab

j+c ,

+jc ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

do not lead to new constraints, because the right hand sides of (2.10) are weakly equal to

zero. in fact, the last equation means that chiral currents are separately conserved

dj+a  j+a  fab
d+ja  +ja  fab

j+c = 0 ,

cbb

cab
+jc = 0 ,

(2.11)

or that both vector and axial vector currents are conserved.

the currents ja and j+a correspond to the arbitrary multipliers aa

+ and ba


respectively

in (2.9), and consequently they are fcc. eqs. (2.6) lead to the same conclusion.

therefore, the classical theory has local non-abelian gauge symmetries, whose generators

ja satises the corresponding pb algebra (2.6).

b. quantum theory

in passing from the classical to the quantum domain, we introduce the operators i


in-

stead of the eld i


, replace the pb by the commutators and dene the composite operators

using normal ordered prescription

ja =: ta  : ,

 =: 




: .

(2.12)

the gauge elds aa

+ and ba


will be considered as classical background elds.

5

then, instead of the pb algebra (2.6) and (2.7) we obtain corresponding commutator

algebra

[ja, jb] = ih[fab

cjc  2ab] ,

[, ja] = ihja ,

[j+a, jb] = 0 ,
[, ja] = 0 ,

(2.13)

with  = h

8 . for details of derivations see the appendix.

in the quantum theory, as well as in the classical one, we also have a pair of commuting

km algebras but this time with a central charge, in this case known as schwinger term.

therefore, the constraints ja which were fcc in the classical theory, become scc operators
ja
in the quantum theory. this means that the theory is anomalous, because the classical

symmetry generated by fcc ja is destroyed at the quantum level. after quantization the
theory obtains new degrees of freedom.

note that under parity transformation p :   , so that p ja(, )p = ja(,)
and p (, )p = (,). consequently, relations (2.13) with plus and minus indices
are connected by parity transformation. this means that our regularization scheme is left-

right symmetric, because the normal order prescription takes the regularization role of the

theory.

iii. gauge wznw model as an effective action

the pb algebra (2.6) is the symmetry generator algebra, because ja are of the fcc.
the commutator algebra (2.13) is the algebra of dynamical variables (except the zero modes,

see [8]), because there is a constant central term on the right hand side. our intention is to

nd the eective theory for these variables, which means the quantum version of the action

(2.1).

we introduce new variables ja and  and postulate that their classical pb algebra

{ja, jb} = fab

cjc  2ab ,

{, ja} = ja ,

{j+a, jb} = 0 ,
{, ja} = 0 ,

(3.1)

6

is isomorphic to the commutator algebra (2.13) of the operators ja and . we also dene
the canonical and the total hamiltonian densities in analogy with (2.4) and (2.9)

hc = +   ,

ht = hc + 2(aa

+ja + ba


j+a) .

(3.2)

we should construct the canonical eective action w , for the theory with pb algebra

(3.1) and with hamiltonian density (3.2). in subsec.a we are going to nd the expressions

for the currents and hamiltonian density in terms of the phase-space variables, and then in

subsec.b we will apply general canonical method [6,7] to nd the action w .

a. bosonic representation for the pb algebra

let us solve eqs.

(3.1), i.e. nd the expressions for the currents ja and for the
energy-momentum tensor  in terms of the coordinate q and the corresponding momenta
, which satises

{q, } = 

  .

we will start with the ansatz, that the currents are linear in the momenta

ja = ea

( + r) ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

where the coecients ea
. we also suppose that the matrices ea
indices , , ... run over the same range as a, b, ...

 and r are the functions of q only, and do not depend on the
a. the

 have inverses, which we denote by e

substituting (3.4) into the rst equation (3.1) we obtain an equation linear in . the

vanishing coecient in front of momentum gives

eb

ea

  ea

eb

 = fab

cec

 ,

or equivalently

e

c  e

c = fab

ce

ae

b .

7

(3.5)

(3.6)

the second condition (term without ) yields

ea

eb

[{, r} + {r, }] = 2ab .

(3.7)

on the right side there is derivative of the delta function, so there must also be a derivative

on the left side, and we suppose that

r = p(q)q .

using this in (3.7) we obtain two conditions,

ea

eb

(p + p) = 2ab ,

and

(3.8)

(3.9)

ea

eb

p + ea

(eb

p) + ea

eb

(p  p) = 0 ,

(3.10)

because the coecients in front of  and  must vanishes separately.

if we dene the symmetric tensor

 = e

ae

bab

we can rewrite (3.9) as p + p = 2 and nd its general solution

p = 2( 

1
2

) ,

(3.11)

(3.12)

where  =  is some antisymmetric tensor. the rst term is a solution of homoge-
neous part and the second one is a particular solution of the full equation.

with the help of (3.6) and (3.12) we can obtain from (3.10)

 +  +  = 

1
2

fabce

ae

be

c .

(3.13)

therefore, from the rst eq. (3.1) we got two relations, (3.6) and (3.13). the rst one is a

condition on the e

as and the second one denes s in terms of e

as.

from the second eq. (3.1) we also obtain three equations

8

e+a

eb

  eb

e+a

 = 0 ,

p + eb

e+a

p+ + e+a

eb

(p + p+)

(p + p+ + p)]q = 0 ,

[e+a
+e+a

eb
eb

and

p+ + p = 0 ,

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

as a coecients in front of ,  and e+a

eb

 respectively. from (3.12), (3.16) and the

symmetry properties of  and , follows

+ = ,

+ =  ,

(3.17)

and consequently, from now we will just call them  and , so that (3.12) becomes

p = 2( 

1
2

) .

(3.18)

with the help of (3.6) and (3.11) we recognize e
 as the cartan metric in coordinate basis.

a as vielbeins on the group manifold, and

eq. (3.15) is a linear combination of equations (3.13), (3.14) and (3.16), and does not

give anything new. we will discus eq. (3.14) soon.

to make the geometric interpretation clearer we introduce a dierential form notation.

let us dene the pair of lie-algebra valued 1-forms

and the 2-form

v = tae

a

dq ,

 =

1
2

dqdq .

then equations (3.6) become the maurer-cartan (mc) equations

dv + v2


= 0 .

9

(3.19)

(3.20)

(3.21)

they have a simple solutions in which the mc forms v are expressed in terms of group-
valued elds g as

v = g

1dg .

in new notation equation (3.13) with the help of (3.17) obtains the form

d = 

1
3!

(v, v2


) ,

(3.22)

(3.23)

where (x, y ) is the cartan inner product dened as (ta, tb) = ab, so that in our normaliza-

tion (ta, tb) = 2tr{tatb}.

from the second eq.(3.17) and (3.11) we have

and from (3.23)

(v+, v+) = (v, v) ,

(v+, v2

+) = (v, v2


) .

(3.24)

(3.25)

the cartan-killing form (x, y ) is invariant under the adjoint action of the group element

g : (g1xg, g1y g) = (x, y ), so we can conclude that v+ and v are connected as

v = g1v+g ,

(3.26)

where g is a group valued eld. substituting (3.22) in (3.26) we easily obtain that g = g =
g1
+ and nally

v+ = gdg1 ,

v = g1dg .

(3.27)

let us now come back to equation (3.14). after some transformations we can write it as

or with the help of (3.21) as v2


consequence of the (3.26).

dv = g1dv+g ,

(3.28)

= g1v2

+g. therefore, it is not a new relation but the

10

the nal result for the current components is

ja = ea

[ + 2( 

)q] .

1
2

(3.29)

we still need to solve the last two equations (3.1). because all expressions with the

opposite chirality commute, we will take  = (ja). the group invariant expressions

 = 

1
4

jajb ,

(3.30)

representing the components of energy-momentum tensor, is the solution we are looking for.

it is enough to use only the rst two relations (3.1) and not the expressions (3.29), to check

that (3.30) satises the last two equations (3.1).

b. eective action

we are ready to construct the eective action based on the general canonical formalism.

it takes the standard form

w (q, , a, b) = z d2( q  ht ) ,

(3.31)

where the total hamiltonian ht = +   +2(aa

+ja + ba


j+a), is dened in (3.2). the

expressions for the current components and for the energy-momentum tensor components

in terms of canonical pairs (q, ) are dened in (3.29) and (3.30).

to nd the usual second-order form of the action, we will eliminate the momentum

variables  on their equations of motion

q 

1
2

(j+ + j) + 2(a

+ + b


) = 0 ,

(3.32)

where a

+ = e+

= e
have on the equations of motion



aaa

+, b




aba


and j = e

aja . with the help of (3.29) we

= 2(q + a

+ + b


) .

j 


(3.33)

substituting this in (3.31), after some calculations we nd

11

w (q, a, b) = w0(q) + w1(q, a, b) ,

(3.34)

where

w0(q) = z d2pq+q = z d2(  2)q+q ,
e

aba + aa

+e+a

bbb

w1(q, a, b) = 2z d2[qe+
+a+a + ba


(aa

+

1
2

aa+a + +qe
ba)] .

(3.35)

it is possible to add to the eective action some local functional, depending on the elds

a+ and b. in order to cancel the last term in (3.35) we add

w = z d2[aa

+a+a + ba


ba] ,

and get

wl,r = w + w ,

(3.36)

(3.37)

where the meaning of the indices l, r will be clear in sec. v.

in the dierential form notation, with cartan inner product normalization, using the

stokes theorem we have

1
2

w0(v) =

z
(w1 + w )(v, a, b, ) = z


(v, v2


(v, v) 
[(v+, a  a)  (v, b + b)
(b + b, g1(a  a)g)] .

zm

2

) ,

1
3

(3.38)

here, w0(v) is the well known wznw model [2,9]. as dened in (3.19), v are the lie
algebra valued 1-forms and v are the dual of v. both expressions for w0(v) are equal
on the basis of (3.24) and (3.25). the rst term is the action of the nonlinear model,

while the second one is the topological wesszumino term, dened over a threemanifold
m whose boundary is the spacetime: m = . for our value of  =  h

8 it reads

h

24 zm

(g1dg, g1dgg1dg) ,

12

(3.39)

so that it is well-dened modulo 2hn, where n  z is a winding number. we want to
stress, that the proper value of  for which quantum theory is single-valued is determined

from the central charge, which we obtained using just the normal ordered prescription in

quantum fermionic theory.

the expression for w1 + w is the regular part of the gauge extension of the wznw

action. it has been obtained in the process of consistent gauge invariant extension of the

wznw model [10].

starting with the pb algebra (3.1) and eq.

(3.2), we obtained the action (3.38) for

any value of the constant . but, the uniqueness of the irreducible representation of the

km algebra, as well as topological arguments [2] force it just to the same value as in our

normal-order approach.

iv. bosonization

a. the chiral currents bosonization rules

in the previous section we obtained the eective action w for massless fermi theory in

the external gauge elds. this is equivalent, to solving the functional integral

zf (a, b) = z d+deis(+,,a,b) .

(4.1)

the nal result depends only on the background elds a and b. the bosonic expression

for w depends not only on a and b, but also on some auxiliary elds, q and  in the

hamiltonian and g in the lagrangian case. so, after integration over auxiliary elds we can

eliminate them and obtain

zb(a, b) = z ddqeiw (q,,a,b) ,

zb(a, b) = z dgeiwl,r(v,a,b) ,

(4.2)

for the hamiltonian and the lagrangian approach respectively. we are not going to do the

integrations explicitly, because they lead to non local expression in terms of a and b, even

in the abelian case. we only conclude that zf should be proportional to zb

13

zf  zb .

(4.3)

this functional integral identity admits interpretation in terms of bosonization. dierenti-

ating (4.3) with respect to ba


and aa

+ and setting a+ = 0 = b, we obtain the bosonization

rules for chiral currents in non-abelian theory.

if we choose the expression w (q, , a, b) from (3.31) as an eective action we get the

hamiltonian bosonization rules

i


ta  ea

( + pq) ,

(4.4)

and if we choose wl,r(v, a, b) from (3.38), we get the well known lagrangian bosonization

rules

i+ta+  

2g+g1

ta  

2g1g .

i


b. the chiral densities bosonization rules

it is possible to add the mass term

 = + + 


+

(4.5)

(4.6)

to the action (2.1) and nd the corresponding expression in terms of the bosonic variables.

let us introduce the chiral densities

 = 

1  5

2

 = 


 = i .

(4.7)

all expressions are matrices with indices i, j (for example ij

 = ii


j
) but we will omit

them for simplicity.

it is easy to nd the pb between the chiral densities and the currents ja, dened in

(2.3)

{ja, } = (ta) ,

{ja, } = (ta) .

(4.8)

14

in the quantum theory the central term does not appear, so the commutation relations,
up to ih, are the same as pb (4.8). the commutators with the currents ja completely
dene the expressions for .

for the bosonic representations, instead of  we introduce the corresponding matrix
valued expressions , depending on the bosonic variables. their pb algebra with ja
should be isomorphic to the operators algebra of  with ja

{ja, } = (ta) ,

{ja, } = (ta) .

(4.9)

both relations (4.9) will give the same result, so we will solve only the rst one.

assuming that  does not depend on the momenta, and using the expression (3.29) for

the current, we obtain the equation

ea

 = ta .

multiplying it with e

a

dq, with the help of (3.19) we get

1


d = v .

comparing last equation with (3.27), we conclude that

+ = m g1 ,

 = m g ,

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

where m is a constant. because g is dimensionless, m has dimension of mass. at the end,

we can complete our bosonization formulae for the chiral densities

  + +  = m(g + g1) ,

5  + +  = m(g1  g) .

(4.13)

they are the same for the hamiltonian and lagrangian case, because they do not depend on

the momenta and agree with those of reference [2].

v. canonical approach to anomalies

15

a. from schwinger term to anomalies

the schwinger term breaks the symmetries, changing the generators from the fcc to

the scc. it is interesting to investigate its inuence on the transformation properties of the

eective action.

let us extend the previously described general canonical method for constructing the

eective action, from the known pb algebra to the case with the central term. the basic

idea of that approach was, that the action

w = z d2[ q  hc  mgm]

is invariant under gauge transformations

f () = {f (),z d()gm()}

of any quantity f (, q), and

m = m  nhm

n  nkfkn

m

of lagrange multipliers m, if gm are the fcc

{gm, gn} = fmn

pgp ,

{hc, gm} = hm

ngn .

here we adopted the notation appropriate for eld theory.

in the case where the central term is present the rst equation (5.4) becomes

{gm, gn} = fmn

pgp + mn(, ) .

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

we want to preserve the gauge transformations of the elds (5.2) and (5.3). then the

schwinger term appears in the variation of the eective action

w = z d d z dm()mn(, )n() .

(5.6)

the method, we have used, works only for actions linear in the gauge elds m. we

can add arbitrary local functional w (m) to the eective action and obtain the general

expression for the anomaly

16

an(,  ) =

w

n(,  )

= z dnm(, )m(,  ) +



n(,  )

w .

(5.7)

the non trivial part of the anomaly is proportional to the schwinger term, because it breaks

the symmetry and measures non-invariance of the eective action.

we want to emphasize, that we do not need the expression for the generators gm in

terms of  and q to obtain (5.6) and (5.7). it is enough to know only the central term,

and the anomaly will depend on the gauge eld m, but not on the phase space coordinate.

b. the left-right and the axial anomalies

we can apply this method to the classical fermionic theory with

gm = j+a,
m = 2ba

m = a,

ja,
, 2aa
+,
a,

and obtain the well known transformations under the local gauge group gl  gr

 =  ,
+ = + ,

a+ = +  [a+, ] ,
b =   [b, ]

(5.8)

where  = ata and  = ata.

in the case of the bosonic theory we have

gm = j+a,
m = 2ba

m = a,

ja,
, 2aa
+,
a,

and

mn(, )  2ab(  )

(m  (a,) , n  (b,)) .

(5.9)

the local gauge transformations for the elds a+ and b are the same as in (5.8) and for
matter elds we have

17

which yields

q = ae+a

  aea

 ,

g = g  g

(see [8] and the second ref. [7]).

under these transformations we have from (5.6) and (5.9)

w = 42z d2tr{b

  a+} .

when we include the transformation of the w (3.36)

(w ) = 4z d2tr{+a+ + b}

we obtain

(5.10)

(5.11)

(5.12)

(5.13)

wl,r = 4z d2tr{a+ + +b} ,

al = 2a+ ,

ar = 2+b+ ,

(5.14)

where wl,r = w + w as in (3.37).

in this case both left and right symmetries are

anomalous, which we denoted by indices l, r.

we can add the nite local counterterm

wax = 4z d2tr{a+b} ,

(5.15)

and shift anomaly from left-right to axial one. the redened eective action wax = wl,r +

wax is invariant under the vector gauge transformation:  =  = v

vwax = 0 ,

but not under the axial one:  =  = ax

axwax = 8z d2tr{axf} ,

aax = 4f ,

the second equation (5.17) is the well known result for axial anomaly.

the non-invariance of the eective action is a consequence of the non-conservation of the

currents. the hamiltonian equations of motion have anomalous divergent currents, instead

of the conserved one in (2.11). taking into account w and wax, the same expressions

for al , ar (5.14) and for aax (5.17) can be obtained.

vi. concluding remarks

we presented here a complete and independent derivation of the two dimensional gauged

wznw model, using the hamiltonian methods. we also obtained hamiltonian and la-

grangian non-abelian bosonization rules and the expression for the anomalies.

we started with canonical analysis of the theory of massless chiral fermions coupled to the

external gauge eld. we found that there are fcc ja, whose pb satises two independent
copies of km algebras without central charges. in passing to the quantum theory, the central
term appears in the commutation relations of the operators ja, which changes the nature
of constraints: they become scc instead of fcc.

we dene the new eective theory, postulating the pb of the constraints and hamiltonian

density. particularly, we require that pb algebra of the classical bosonic theory should be

isomorphic to the commutator algebra of the quantum fermionic theory. then we found the

representation for the currents and hamiltonian density in terms of phase space coordinates.

finally, we derived eective action using general canonical formalism and obtained the

gauged wznw model. we want to stress, that we also got the topological wess-zumino

term. the tensor , as its origin, appears in our approach as a general solution of the
homogeneous part of the equation (3.9). the coecient in front of the wess-zumino term

19

is dened by the numerical value of the central charge and gives a correct expression for the

winding number.

once we establish the connection between the fermionic and the bosonic theories, it was

easy to nd the bosonization rules, just dierentiating generating functionals with respect

to the background elds. beside usual bosonization rules, we also got the hamiltonian

ones, expressing the currents ja in terms of both coordinate q and momentum . after
elimination of momenta on the equations of motion, we came back to the conventional

bosonization rules.

the algebra of the currents ja is the basic pb algebra. knowing its representation in
terms of q and  we can nd the representation for all other quantities from their pb

algebra with the currents. as an example we found the bosonization rules for the chiral

densities.

the canonical approach is very suitable for calculation of the anomaly. the general for-

mula (5.7) expresses the anomaly as a function of the schwinger term. the normal ordering

prescription for the quantum operators takes the role of left-right symmetric regularization

scheme. so, we obtain both left and right anomalies. by adding the nite local counterterm

we in fact changed the regularization scheme, and shifted the anomaly from the left-right

symmetric to the axial one.

the schwinger term, and consequently the wznw model and the anomaly have the

correct dependence on plancks constant h, because  is proportional to h. the fact that h

arise in the classical eective theory, shows its quantum origin.

the canonical approach of this paper can be applied to the other symmetries.

if we

take the dieomorphism transformations instead of the non-abelian ones, then we will get

virasoro algebra, 2d induced gravity and conformal anomaly instead of km algebra, wznw

model and axial anomaly. the work of this program is in progress and will be publish

separately.

appendix a: normal ordering and schwinger term

in this appendix we will derive the expression for the central terms in the commutation

relations (2.13).

we dene currents ja as a quantum operators and introduce normal ordering prescrip-
tion. usually, it is convenient to employ the fourier expansion of the elds, identifying the

modes as a creation and annihilation operators with respect to fock vacuum state.

following [11] we prefer to decompose operators in positive and negative frequencies in

the position space. we introduce two parts of delta function

()() = z 


dk
2

2(  i)
so that () = (+)() + ()() with the following properties

(k)eik(i) =

i

,

( > 0)

(a1)

((+))2  (())2 = i
then for any operator (, ) we can perform the splitting

()() = ()() ,

2

 .

(a2)

()(, ) = z 


()(  ) (, ) ,

(a3)

where  = (+) + ().

now, we adopt ()

+ and ()

+ as creation operators and (+)

+ and (+)

+ as annihilation

operators

+ |0i = (+)
(+)

+ |0i = 0 ,

h0|()

+ = h0| ()

+ = 0 .

(a4)

to preserve symmetry under parity transformations, we dene creation and annihilation
operators for  and  in an opposite way (with index (+) for a creation and index ()

21

for an annihilation operator). then in the both cases, the normal order for products of

operators means that annihilation operators are placed to the right of the creations one.

from the basic commutation relations [ i


, j

] = ihij, we can conclude that the only

non trivial parts are

[ ()

+ (), ()

+ ()] = ih()(  ) ,

[ ()
 (), ()

 ()] = ih()(  ) .

(a5)

after some calculation it is possible to check the commutator algebra (2.13). because the

central term is the only possible dierence compared to the pb algebra, the easiest way to

conrm (2.13) is to start with expression

[ja, jb] = ih(fab

cjc  ab) ,

(a6)

and nd its vacuum expectation value. with the help of (a2) and with the convention
tr{tatb} =  1

2 ab, we obtain

ab =

h
2

tr{tatb} = 2ab ,

( = h

)

proving the rst relation (2.13).

commutators [j+, j] and [, j] do not have central extensions.
