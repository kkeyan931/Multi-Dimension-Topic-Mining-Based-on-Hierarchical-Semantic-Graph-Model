abstract

an algebraic method is devised to look for non-local symmetries of
the pseudopotential type of nonlinear eld equations. the method is
based on the use of an innite-dimensional subalgebra of the prolon-
gation algebra l associated with the equations under consideration.
our approach, which is applied by way of example to the dym and
the korteweg-de vries equations, allows us to obtain a general formula
for the innitesimal operator of the non-local symmetries expressed in
terms of elements of l. the method could be exploited to investigate
the symmetry properties of other nonlinear eld equations possessing
nontrivial prolongations.

introduction

local symmetries of dierential equations (des) are dened by innitesimal
operators which generally are functions of the independent and the depen-
dent variables (elds) involved in the equations under consideration. on the
contrary, non-local symmetries are characterized by innitesimal operators
depending on the global behavior of the elds, expressed for instance by their
integrals [1,2].

the study of non-local symmetries can be performed following a pro-
cedure which relates these symmetries to the local symmetries of certain
auxiliary systems of equations connected with the original des. an interest-
ing situation is that where these equations can be expressed as conservation
laws.
indeed, in this case it is possible to introduce new dependent vari-
ables, called potentials, which can be dened by quadratures. hence, with
a given original system of des (x, u), where x = (x1, ..., xm)  rm and
u = (u1, ..., un)  rn, one can associate a system (x, u, y) (see later) which
depends on the set of potential variables y = {yi} as well, with the property
that any solution (u(x), y(x)) of  is also a solution of . viceversa, for any
solution u(x) of  there is a potential y(x) such that the pair (u(x), y(x)) is
a solution of  [2]. of course, any symmetry group s of  will be also a
symmetry group of .

more generally, any local group of transformations of  denes a non-
local group of transformations of , provided that the generators of the
innitesimal symmetry transformations (of the independent and dependent
variables) are explicit functions of the potential. then, the non-local case
can be treated using the same algorhitmic procedures valid for the local
symmetries.

the potential symmetries can also be exploited to carry out the symmetry
reduction of a given system of dierential equations. the case of partial dif-
ferential equations has been dealt with by bluman and reid [3]. other kinds
of non-local symmetries have been studied in [4-6]. recently, guthrie and
hickman [7] have derived new algebraic structures for the bi-hamiltonian
version of the korteweg-de vries (kdv) equation. since the inverse recur-
rence operator for this equation, because of its bi-hamiltonian origin, is still a
recurrence operator, it can generate three new families of generalized symme-
tries, depending on non-local variables. these symmetries can be interpreted
as isovectors of a prolonged system of the kdv equation, which are found
starting from an innite-dimensional realization of the estabrook-wahlquist
(ew) prolongation algebra.

a remarkable generalization of the concept of non-local symmetry, i.e.
the lie-backlund (non-local) symmetry, has been devised by edelen [8] and
krasilshchik and vinogradov [9], where the non-locality character is carried
out by variables of the pseudopotential type.
in this context, galas has
rederived the one-soliton solutions for the kdv and the dym equations, and
the akns system [10]. the non-local lie-backlund technique presents the

2

benet to join up the ew prolongation method [11], which yields the set of
pseudopotentials, to the symmetry reduction approach [1], giving the tools
for analyzing eld equations via the group theory. other interesting results
on the theory of non-local symmetries have been achieved in [12] and [13].

in this paper we outline a procedure to obtain non-local symmetries of
the psedopotential type of a partial dierential equation admitting an incom-
plete prolongation algebra l (in the sense that not all of the commutators
of l are known). equations enjoying this property are important both from
a mathematical point of view and in physical applications. our method
consists essentially in looking for an innite-dimensional subalgebra l of l
containing as a special case a nite-dimensional subalgebra lo of l. this
procedure is suggested by the fact that in the framework of lo only triv-
ial non-local symmetries can be found. the innite dimensionality of the
subalgebra seems to be crucial for the determination of nontrivial non-local
symmetries. within our approach, which is applied to the dym and the kdv
equations, we obtain a general formula for the innitesimal operator of the
non-local symmetries expressed in terms of elements of l. in theory, other
equations (or systems of equations) endowed with nontrivial prolongations
could be treated in a similar way.

the paper is organized as follows. section 2 is devoted to some prelimi-
naries on potential and pseudopotential symmetries. in sections 3 and 4 we
consider the dym and the kdv equations, respectively. the prolongation
algebras allowed by these equations are incomplete. we apply the algebraic
technique described above to yield the generators of the non-local symmetries
(of the pseudopotential type) together with examples of interesting solutions
of the equations under study. some of these solutions are well-known and
do not represent, of course, the main goal of the paper, which is based con-
versely on a unifying (algebraic) tool to nd non-local symmetries. finally,
section 5 contains some concluding remarks, while in the appendices a and
b details of the calculations are reported.

2 potential and pseudopotential symmetries

let us deal with a system of nonlinear eld equations

(x, u)  ut + k(x, t, u, ux, ..., ux...x) = 0,

(2.1)

3

with (x, t)  r2, u = (u1, ..., un)  rn and ut = dt(u), ux = d(u), and
so on, where dt and dx stand for the total derivatives with respect to t and
x.

let us suppose that the system (2.1) admits conservation laws of the type


t

fi(x, t, u, ux, ..., ux...x) =


x

gi(x, t, u, ux, ..., ux...x).

(2.2)

equations (2.2) allow us to introduce a set of potentials y = {yi} such

that

yi,x = fi,

yi,t = gi.

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

then one can consider non-local lie-backlund operators for the system (2.1)
of the form

v = qj(x, t, u, ux, ..., ux...x, y)


uj

.

(2.4)

the non-local character of v is due to the fact that it depends on the

variables yi, which are dened by quadratures.

the lie-backlund non-local symmetries corresponding to v are equiv-
alent to the lie-point symmetries of the system (x, u, y) constituted by
eq. (2.1) and by the set of conservation laws (2.2). these symmetries are
generated by vector elds of the form

v = (x, t, u, y)


x

+ (x, t, u, y)


t

+j(x, t, u, y)


uj

+i(x, t, u, y)


yi

(2.5)

where the coecients depend explicitly on the potential variables.

non-local symmetries can be extended to the case in which the (non-local)
symmetry operators depend on psudopotential variables [10]. in opposition
to the potential variables, pseudopotential variables can be dened by the
set of implicit equations

yi,x = fi(x, t, u, ux, ..., ux...x, y), yi,t = gi(x, t, u, ux, ..., ux...x, y),

(2.6)

4

where the functional dependence of fi and gi includes the pseudopoten-
tial variables also. the compatibility condition yi,xt = yi,tx reproduces the
original equations of the type (2.1). equations (2.6) allow us to obtain, in
theory, the prolongation algebra associated with the dierential equations
under consideration and the related spectral problem [12].

in the following we shall display two case studies concerning the determi-

nation of non-local symmetries based on the use of pseudopotentials.

3 non-local symmetries of the dym equation

the ew prolongation technique applied to the dym equation

gives

ut = u3uxxx

yi,x = fi =

ai
u2 + bi,
2
u

yi,t = gi = 2aiuxx  2ciux 

[a, c]i + 2u[b, c]i,

(3.1)

(3.2a)

(3.2b)

where ai, bi, ci are functions depending on the pseudopotential variables

only, and [a, c]i, [b, c]i are lie brackets dened by

[a, c]i = aj


yj

ci  cj


yj

ai,

and so on.
hereafter, for simplicity we shall omit the index i and adopt an operator

formalism, in the sense that we shall dene the operators

f = fj

, g=gj


yj


yj

, a= aj


yj

, ...,

etc.. then the lie brackets are transformed into commutators, viz.

[ a, c]  [a, c]j


yj

, ...

. furthermore, to avoid redundance of symbols,

we shall continue to use f instead of f , and so on.

5

from the compatibility condition yxt = ytx we have that the operators

a, b, c obey the commutation rules

[a, b] = c,

[a, [a, c]] = 0,

[b, [b, c]] = 0.

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

(3.3c)

equations (3.3a)-(3.3c) dene an incomplete lie algebra. in order to in-
vestigate the existence of non-local symmetries (of the pseudopotential type)
of eq. (3.1), let us deal with the innitesimal transformation

u= u+ (u, ux, y),

where  is a function to be found and  is a real parameter.
by imposing (3.4), eq. (3.1) yields

t = 3u2uxxx + u3xxx,

(3.4)

(3.5)

where t = dt and x = dx.
at this stage it is convenient to adopt a procedure which consists in the
use of the prolongation algebra (3.3a)-(3.3c) without employing any specic
representation for the vector elds a, b, c.

by expliciting (3.5) and equating to zero the coecients of the derivatives

of u regarded as independent functions, we get

where o is a function of y satisfying the constraints

 = (ux  ub)o(y),

ao = 0,
a2bo = 0,
b3o = 0,

bcbo = 0,

2[a, c]bo + a2b2o + ababo = 0.

6

(3.6)

(3.7a)

(3.7b)

(3.7c)

(3.7d)

(3.7e)

equations (3.7a) and (3.7b) entail

[a, c]o = 0.

(3.8)

now let us introduce an innitesimal transformation for the pseudopo-

tential y analogous to (3.4):

y= y + (u, y),

(3.9)

where (u, y) is a vector eld to be determined.
we observe that both  and  could have a functional dependence more
complicated than that made here; indeed, the choice expressed by eqs. (3.4)
and (3.9) corresponds to a minimal assumption. we notice also that if we
take  independent from ux, only the identity arises as a symmetry.

combining together (3.9) and (3.2a) we obtain

yx= yx + x(u, y) = f (y + , u + ) = f + (fy + fu).

hence

namely

uxu + [f, ]  fu = 0,

uxu +

1
u2 [a, ] + [b, ] +

2
u3

uxoa 

2
u2 (bo)a = 0.

(3.10)

taking equal to zero the coecients of the independent functions of u and
their partial derivatives appearing in (3.10), we nd

o = o(y) being a vector eld of integration, and

 =

1
u2

oa + o,

[a, oa] = 0,

[a, o] + [b, oa]  2(bo)a = 0,

[b, 0] = 0.

(3.11)

(3.12a)

(3.12b)

(3.12c)

in a similar manner, starting from (3.2b) and taking account of (3.9), we
obtain (at the rst order in ):

7

u3uxxxu + [g, ] 

2
u2

[a, c]  2[b, c] + 2xc + 2xxa = 0.

(3.13)

equation (3.13) can be explicited to give

(abo)a  [c, oa]  o[a, c] = 0,
[c, o] + o[b, c] + (b2o)a = 0,

[[a, c], oa] = 0,

(3.14a)

(3.14b)

(3.14c)

(3.14d)

[[b, c], o] + (bo)[b, c]  (b2o)c = 0,

[[b, c], oa]  [[a, c], o] + (bo)[a, c]  a(bo)c  (ab2o)a

(babo)a = 0.

(3.14e)
finally, the innitesimal generator of the nonlocal symmetries of the

pseudopotential type for the dym equation is (see (3.6) and (3.11))

vn l = u +  = (uxo  ubo)u +

1
u2

oa + o.

(3.15)

the problem of the determination of the non-local symmetries of the dym
equation is led to nd suitable representations of the incomplete prolongation
algebra (3.3a)-(3.3c) and the constraints associated with this equation.

in this context, we shall show below that by choosing a nite-dimensional
representation of the prolongation algebra (3.3a)-(3.3c) of the sl(2, r) type,
we arrive at trivial transformations only.

to this aim, let us set

[a, c] = b1a + b2b + b3c,

[b, c] = c1a + c2b + c3c,

[a, b] = c,

(3.16a)

(3.16b)

(3.16c)

where bj, cj are constants.
then, from (3.3a) and (3.3c) we nd b2 = b3 = 0 and c1 = c3 = 0,
respectively. thus, putting b1 = 2, b2 = 2 eqs. (3.16a)-(3.16c) become
(3.17a)

[a, c] = 2a,

8

[b, c] = 2b,

[a, b] = c.

on the other hand, eq. (3.14d) gives

while from (3.14e):

2(bo)b = (b2o)c,

(2(bo)  (ab2o)  (ba(bo))a = (abo)c.

applying (3.19) to o yields

(abo)(co) = 0,

from which

(3.17b)

(3.17c)

(3.18)

(3.19)

as a consequence, the constraint (3.18) provides bo = 0. to conclude,

the quotient algebra (3.17a)-(3.17c) leads to the relations

co = 0.

(3.20)

ao = 0, bo = 0, co = 0,

(3.21)

which tell us that o = const.

3.1 the method of the extended algebra

we have seen that within a nite-dimensional subalgebra (such as sl(2, r))
of the prolongation algebra l dened by (3.3a)-(3.3c), we have not been able
to nd nontrivial non-local symmetries. then, we have exploited an innite-
dimensional subalgebra of l. as we show below, this approach succeeds. to
this aim, let us introduce the operators

a = a0 + 0a1,

b = bo,

9

(3.22)

(3.23)

into the commutation relations (3.3a)-(3.3c), where

c = c0  (b00)a1,

[a0, b0] = c0, [a0,c0] = 2a0, [b0, c0] = 2b0
and a1 denotes an operator obeying the commutation rules

(3.24)

(3.25)

[a1, a0] = 0, [a1, b0] = 0, [a1, c0] = 0.

(3.26)

furthermore, we assume that

and

a10 = 0,

a00 = a2

oboo = b3

o o = 0.

(3.27)

(3.28)

(we observe that the constraints (3.28) are really special cases of (3.7a),

(3.7b) and (3.7c), respectively).

by virtue of (3.22)-(3.28), we can prove directly that the commutators

[a, b0] = c0  (b00)a1,

[a, c] = 2a0  {(a0b00) + (c00)}a1,

[b0, c] = 2b0  (b2

0 0)a1,

(3.29a)

(3.29b)

(3.29c)

realize the prolongation algebra l expressed by (3.3a)-(3.3c).
when a1 = 0, we obtain a = a0, c = c0, and the commutation rules
(3.29a)-(3.29c) reproduce just the sl(2, r) algebra (3.25). in some sense, the
algebra dened by eqs. (3.29a)-(3.29c) plays the role of an extended alge-
bra, le , relatively to the sl(2, r) algebra (3.25). since a1 is multiplied by an
arbitrary function, it turns out that le is an innite-dimensional subalgebra
of l (satisfying all the constraints involved by the theory of non-local sym-
metries). in the following, we shall see that the use of le instead of sl(2, r)
enables us to obtain nontrivial non-local symmetries.

10

now let us demand that

[ao, o] = 0, [bo, o] = 0, [co, o] = 0.

(3.30)

a possible bidimensional realization of the algebra (3.25) is

ao = y1,

bo = y2
1y1 + y1y2,
co = 2y1y1 + y2.

from (3.12b) we nd

[a1, o] =

oo
o

a1 +

boo

o

ao + co,

while (3.14b) gives

[a1, o] =

(oboo)
(boo)

a1 +

2obo
(boo)

+

(b2

o o)ao
(boo)

.

furthermore, from (3.14d) we deduce

[a1, o] =

(ob2
(b2

o o)
o o)

a1 +

2obo
(b2

o o)  co.

by comparing (3.32), (3.33) and (3.34) we have

(oo)

(3.31a)

(3.31b)

(3.31c)

(3.32)

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

(3.36)

now we are ready to derive o, a1, and o. in doing so, let us suppose that
these quantities can be expressed as

o = o(y)  o(y1, y2, y3),

a1 = a1(y)y1 + a2(y)y2 + a3(y)y3,

o = f1(y)y1 + f2(y)y2 + f3(y)y3,

(3.37)

(3.38)

(3.39)

where aj, fj are functions of y  (y1, y2, y3) to be determined.

11

from (3.36) we deduce

which yields

boo = 2oy1,

o = (y3)e2y2,

(3.40)

(3.41)

(y3) being a function of integration depending on y3 only.

then, taking account of (3.40), it turns out that (3.35) and (3.36) are

identically satised.

on the other hand, since a1o = 0 we get (see (3.41) and (3.38)):

2a2(y)(y3) + a3(y)y3(y3) = 0.

(3.42)

then, resorting to the commutation rule [a1, bo] = 0, we can write

[bo, a1] = (y2
which gives a1(y) = 0.

1y1 + y1y2)a1o + a1(y2

1y1  y1y2)o = 0,

(3.43)

furthermore, from [a1, ao] = 0 we infer that the functions a2 and a3
appearing in (3.42) are independent from the pseudopotential variable y1,
i.e. a2 = a2(y2, y3), a3 = a3(y2, y3).

finally, the commutation relation [a1, co] = 0 yields

a1 = a2(y3)y2 + a3(y3)y3,

(3.44)

where a2 and a3 are functions of the pseudopotential variable y3 only.
at this point let us consider the operator o, which obeys the commutation
[co, o] = 0. the role of o is formally

rules [ao, o] = 0,
analogous to that played by a1. therefore, we easily get

[bo, o] = 0,

o = f2(y3)y2 + f3(y3)y3.

(3.45)

then, we can exploit the commutator [a1, o] expressed by (3.32). indeed,
substituting (3.44) and (3.45) into (3.32) and equating the coecients of y2
and y3 to zero, we are led to the relations

f3a2y3  a3f2y3 + 2f2a2 + f3a2

y3


+  = 0,

(3.46)

12

 a3f3y3 + a3y3f3 + 2f2a3 + f3a3

y3


= 0.

(3.47)

we remark that the same relations come from (3.14e).

equations (3.42), (3.46) and (3.47) represent an overdetermined system
with unknowns a2, a3, f2, f3, and . the knowledge of these quantities pro-
vides the function o and the operators a1, o.

by using the realization (3.31a)-(3.31c), (3.44) and (3.45), the generator

(3.15) takes the form

vn l = (y3)e2y2x  2u(y3)y1e2y2u + (y3)e2y2y2

+[f2(y3)  y1(y3)e2y2]y2 + f3(y3)y3.

1y1

(3.48)

thus, the corresponding group transformations arise from the dierential

equations

(3.49b)

(3.49d)

(3.49e)

where t= t,  is the group parameter, and the boundary conditions

x|=0= x, u|=0= u, y1|=0= y1, y2|=0= y2, y3|=0= y3,

(3.50)

are considered.

now, in order to illustrate how our method works, let us consider the triv-
ial solution u = 1 to eq. (3.1). consequently, the prolongation equations
(3.2a) and (3.2b) provide

13

y1x =   y2
1,

y1t = 42 + 4y2
1,

y2x = y1 + a2(y3)e2y2 ,

y2t = 8a2(y3)e2y2  4y1 + 4a2y2

1(y3)e2y2,

y3x = a3(y3)e2y2,
y3t = 8a3(y3)e2y2 + 4a3y2

1(y3)e2y2,

(3.51a)

(3.51b)

(3.51c)

(3.51d)

(3.51e)

(3.51f)

where here y1, y2, y3 have not to be regarded as vector elds, but functions
of (x, t).

after some manipulations, from the equations (3.49a)-(3.49e) and (3.51a)-

(3.51f) we obtain

u= u

y2

y

(3.52)

where y1 can be derived by solving the pair of riccati equations (3.51a)

and (3.51b). by choosing for example  > 0, we obtain

y1 = 

  ae
e
e + ae


,

(3.53)

where a is a constant of integration, and  = x  4t.
by scrutinizing the remaining equations involving the prolongation vari-

ables, i.e. (3.51c)-(3.51f), we have

y1= y1

(e2  a2e2)

(3.54)

in order to look for interesting solutions to eq. (3.1) (starting from the
trivial solution u = 1), we have to use eq. (3.52) and write the variables

14

x, t in terms of x, t. in doing so, since t =t , it is sucient to consider eqs.
(3.49a) and (3.49c). these yield

x= x +

(3.55)

then, by using (3.54) and (3.53) we have (t =t)

x= x

(e2  a2e2)

.

(3.56)

from (3.56) we can derive, formally, x as a function of x and t: x =  (x

, t ). then, from eq. (3.52) (with u = 1) we obtain

u=

(3.57)

where  =  (x, t)  4 t .
we remark that for a = 0,  = 1 and  < 0, eq. (3.57) produces the

(formal) solitary wave solution

u= sec h2( +)  1,

where  is a constant dened by ||

(3.58)

to that found in [10]. by choosing in the riccati equations (3.51a) and
(3.51b)  < 0, a procedure similar to that employed to derive formula (3.57)
leads to the solution (a3) reported in appendix a.

to conclude this section, we observe that the solutions (3.57) and (a3)
are a consequence of the choice u = 1 (i.e. the trivial solution of the dym
equation) in the backlund transformation (3.52). of course, in theory other
choices should be possible and, correspondingly, other solutions should be
derived.

4 non-local symmetries of the korteweg-de

vries equation

another interesting case which constitutes a good laboratory for checking
the validity of our approach to non-local symmetries with pseudopotentials,
is given by the kdv equation

ut + 6uux + uxxx = 0.

the pseudopotential for eq. (4.1) is dened by

yx = f =

1

u2a + ub + c,

yt = g = (uuxx + 1

(4.1)

(4.2a)

(4.2b)

where a, b, c, d, e are vector elds (depending on y  {yj} only) satis-

fying the commutation relations

[a, b] = [a, c] = [a, d] = 0,

[a, [b, d]] = 0,

[b, [b, d]] = [a, [d, c]] = 0,

[a, e] = 3[c, [b, d]] + 6d,

[b, e] = [c, [c, d]],

[c, e] = 0,

[c, [b, d]] = [b, [c, d]],

(4.3h)

the prolongation algebra (4.3a)-(4.3h) is incomplete.
now let us carry out the innitesimal transformation

then, eq. (4.1) provides

u= u + (u, y).

t + 6ux + 6ux + xxx = 0.

equation (4.5) can be managed to get the following set of constraints:

(4.4)

a = 0,

b2 = 0,

cb = 2,

[b, d] + 6b + b2c + bcb = 0,

(4.6b)

(4.6c)

(4.6d)

(4.6e)

(4.6f)

where  = (y), i.e.  depends on the pseudopotential only.
now let us perform the innitesimal transformation for the pseudopoten-

tial y :

y= y + (u, y).

by virtue of (4.7), eq. (4.2a) yields

uxu + [f, ]  fu = 0.

(4.7)

(4.8)

equation (4.8) tells us that u = 0, i.e.  = (y). moreover, the following

conditions

[b, ] = 0,

(4.9a)

[c, ]  b = 0,

[d, ] + (b)b = 0,

[[b, d], ] = 0,

[e, ] + [c, d]  (c)d + (c 2)b = 0,

(4.9f)

hold.
then, our task is to nd the innitesimal generator of the non-local sym-

metries for eq. (4.1), which reads

vn l = u + .

(4.10)

to this aim, rst we look for a nite-dimensional representation of the
prolongation algebra (4.3a)-(4.3h). assuming a = 0, a representation of this
kind is

[co, bo] = do,
[bo, do] = 2bo,

[co, do] = 4bo + 2co,

eo = 4co,

(4.11a)

(4.11b)

(4.11c)

(4.11d)

where  is an arbitrary parameter.

we have seen that limiting ourselves to starting from the closed algebra
(4.11a)-(4.11d), namely taking a = 0, b = bo, c = co, e = eo, only trivial
non-local symmetries arise. thus, as a possible way out we employ a proce-
dure similar to that applied in section 3 for the case of dym equation. in
other words, we search a realization of the prolongation algebra (4.3a)-(4.3h)
such that

a = 0, b = bo,

(4.12)

and

18

c = co + c1,

(4.13)

where  = (y) is a function of the pseudopotential to be determined,
bo, co, do satisfy the relations (4.11a)-(4.11c), and the operator c1 6= 0 is
supposed to obey the commutation rules

[c1, bo] = [c1, co] = [c1, do] = 0.

(4.14)

for simplicity, we take e1 = c1 .
now let us introduce the operator

e = eo + e1,

(4.15)

where eo is given by (4.11d) and  is a function depending on the pseu-

dopotential. let us assume also that the relations

[e1, bo] = [e1, co] = [e1, do] = 0,

e1 = e1 = 0,

(4.16)

(4.17)

are valid.
by dealing with the commutation rule (4.9a), it is natural to put

 = bo + 1,

(4.18)

where  is a constant, and the operator 1 is chosen in such a way that

[1, bo] = [1, co] = [1, do] = 0.

(4.19)

in order to obtain the innitesimal generator of the non-local symmetries,
we need to know the eld  and the operator  (see (4.10)). to this aim, rst
we shall exploit a specic realization of the algebra (4.11a)-(4.11c). precisely,
let us consider

bo = y1,

co = (  y2

1)y1 + y1y2,

19

(4.20a)

(4.20b)

do = 2y1y1 + y2.

(4.20c)

second, we make the hypothesis that the eld (y) and the functions
(y) and (y) depend on a pseudopotential vector having at least three com-
ponents, say y  (y1, y2, y3). consequently, in this context it is reliable to
suppose that the operators c1 and 1, present in (4.13) and (4.18), respec-
tively, take the form

c1 = 1(y)y1 + 2(y)y2 + 3(y)y3,

(4.21)

and

1 = x1(y)y1 + x2(y)y2 + x3(y)y3,

(4.22)

where j(y) and x(y) are functions to be determined.

starting from the prolongation algebra (4.3a)-(4.3h), and keeping in mind
the previous assumptions and the algebraic constraints (4.6a)-(4.6f) and
(4.9a)-(4.9f), in analogy with the case of the dym equation, we can deduce
another set of constraints which we omit for brevity.

by using all these relations, after some manipulations we have obtained

the following results :

 = 1(y3)e2y2,

 = 1(y3)y1e2y2,

 = 41(y3)y2

1e2y2 + 1(y2, y3),

c1 = 2(y3)y2 + 3(y3)y3,

1 = x2(y3)y2 + x3(y3)y3,

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

(4.26)

(4.27)

where the functions 1 = 1(y3), 1 = 1(y2, y3), 2 = 2(y3), 3 = 3(y3),
x2 = x2(y3), x3 = x3(y3) full the system of linear dierential equations

221 + 31y3 = 0,

(4.28d)

(4.28e)

(4.28f)

this system can be handled by means of the procedure used for the dym

equation.

in doing so, let us explicit the innitesimal generator (4.10), which reads

vn l = y11(y3)e2y2u +
then, from the the group transformations corresponding to the operator

1(y3)e2y2y1 + x2(y3)y2 + x3(y3)y3

(4.29)

(4.29) we easily nd

u= 2(y

2

1 y2

1) + u.

(4.30)

in our scheme, if we choose, for instance, u = 0, the prolongation equa-

tions (4.2a) and (4.2b) become

y1x =   y2
1,

y1t = 42 + 4y2
1,

y2x = y1 + 2(y3)1(y3)e2y2 ,

y2t = 4y1 + (4y2

y3x = 3(y3)1(y3)e2y2,

(4.31d)

(4.31e)

y3t = (4y2

then, for  > 0 , from eqs. (4.31a) and (4.31b) we obtain

y1 =

e + ae




,

(4.31f)

(4.32)

where  = x  4t and a is a constant.
by integrating eqs. (4.31c)-(4.31f), from eq.(4.30) we get (for u = 0)

u =

(4.33)

we notice that since x= x, t= t, this solution is explicit and contains the

well-known soliton solution [10]

u= 2 sec h2( +

),

(4.34)

which emerges for a = 0 and  = 1.
another solution to the kdv equation can be obtained in correspondence

of the choice  < 0. this is quoted in appendix b.

5 conclusions

we have developed a procedure to obtain non-local symmetries of the pseu-
dopotential type of nonlinear eld equations whose prolongation algebra l
is incomplete. we have considered two case studies: the dym and the kdv
equation, respectively. for both equations, rst we have found a nite-
dimensional subalgebra (quotient algebra) lo of the related (incomplete)
prolongation algebra l. then, we have tried to use lo to look for non-local
symmetries.

22

unfortunately, through lo only trivial symmetries emerge. consequently,
we have extended the subalgebra lo by introducing new operators to be de-
termined by the requirement that the commutation relations dening l and
the constraints involved by the innitesimal transformations for the non-local
symmetries are satised. the determination of these new operators is cru-
cial, since they appear in the generator of the non-local symmetries. for the
two equations under investigation this task has been successful. from the
generator of the non-local symmetries, expressed in terms of pseudopoten-
tial variables, one can write the corresponding group transformations which
enable us to yield exact solutions of the dym and the kdv equations. some
of these solutions are well-known. notwithstanding, they serve as paradigms
to probe and to illustrate the potentiality of our algebraic approach.

as we can argue from the results achieved on the above-mentioned appli-
cations, our method could be exploited to treat other nonlinear eld equa-
tions admitting nontrivial prolongations. but some aspects of the method
remain to be elucidated, and only the accumulation of cases could indicate
the appropriate way of implementation. to be precise, for instance we re-
mark that a basic role is played by the realization of the extended al-
gebra in terms of vector elds depending on pseudopotential variables. in
our calculations, we have chosen simple but nonlinear realizations (of the
polynomial type). dierent algebraic realizations (say, polynomial realiza-
tions in higher dimensions or realizations which are not of the polynomial
type) might produce dierent non-local symmetries and, correspondingly,
dierent solutions to the original equations. anyway, this question is to be
explored. another interesting attempt which deserves to be made is the use
of an innite-dimensional realization (of the prolongation algebra l) of the
kac-moody type. could this kind of realization have a signicant role in
the search of non-local symmetries of the pseudopotential type? finally, we
point out that an important problem is the extension of our approach to
nonlinear eld equations in more than 1+1 dimensions. however, due to the
fact that at present only a few applications in higher dimensions have been
carried out within the prolongation scheme [14], this programme is strictly
connected with a possible revival of interest in the extension of the prolon-
gation studies.
