mass and other conserved noether charges are discussed
for solutions of gravity theories with locally anti-de sitter
asymptotics in 2n dimensions. the action is supplemented
with a boundary term whose purpose is to guarantee that it
reaches an extremum on the classical solutions, provided the
spacetime is locally ads at the boundary. it is also shown that
if spacetime is locally ads at spatial innity, the conserved
charges are nite and properly normalized without requir-
ing subtraction of a reference background. in this approach,
noether charges associated to lorentz and dieomorphism in-
variance vanish identically for constant curvature spacetimes.
the case of zero cosmological constant is obtained as a limit
of ads, where  plays the role of a regulator.

i. introduction

noethers theorem is the standard tool in theoretical
physics to construct conserved charges associated with
invariances of the action. nevertheless, general relativ-
ity, described by einstein-hilbert action, does not lend
itself naturally to the application of noethers theorem.
the conserved charge associated to the invariance of the
action under dieomorphisms is given by komars for-
mula [1]

k() = z

d ,

(1)

where  = (16g)1,  =  is a vector eld that
denes the dieomorphism,  represents the covari-
ant derivative in terms of christoel symbol,  is the
boundary of the spatial section, and d = 1
2 dx 
dx is the surface element (dual of the area two-form).

contrera@cecs.cl
rolea@cecs.cl
ratron@cecs.cl
jz@cecs.cl

then, when  is a timelike or rotational killing vector,
k() provides a denition of mass or angular momen-
tum, respectively. however, there is a rst drawback in
this result, that is, in the case of the (3+1)-dimensional
kerr black hole, equation (1) gives the following answer

k( 

t ) = m

2 ; k( 

 ) = j.

(2)

these results show that there is no common normaliza-
tion factor which could give the correct values for mass
and angular momentum.

moreover, there is a second drawback with komars
formula:
in the presence of negative cosmological con-
stant, spacetime is no longer asymptotically at and
the formula yields a divergent value. for example, for
schwarzschild-ads metric, one obtains

k( 

t ) = m

2 + lim
r

r3
2l2 .

(3)

the standard approach to deal with this divergence is
to subtract the value of k() on the ads background
from (3) (see, e.g. [2]). in spite of giving a nite result,
this does not correct the normalization factor of m and
the rst problem mentioned above remains.

the usual procedure to evaluate the conserved charges
is the adm formalism [3], which yields the correct for-
mulas for the energy-momentum and angular momentum
for asymptotically at spacetimes. nevertheless, this ap-
proach and its further extension developed by regge and
teitelboim [4] provides a formula for the variation of the
charges e.g., m , and in order to evaluate the charges
e.g., m , it is necessary to x the reference background
geometry. the hamiltonian method can also be extended
to provide the correct mass and angular momentum for
asymptotically ads spacetimes representing solutions of
einstein-hilbert action with negative cosmological con-
stant in d = 4 [5], as well as for d 6= 4 [6].

in many instances this scheme is suciently satisfac-
tory, but there are some cases of physical interest in which
the asymptotic behavior can be dicult to assess, as
in the case of asymptotically locally anti-de sitter (al-
ads) spaces.

1

a formalism to dene conserved charges in asymptot-
ically ads spaces was proposed by ashtekar and magnon
[7], who used conformal techniques to construct the con-
served quantities. this construction makes no reference
to an action, and yet reproduces the charges obtained by
hamiltonian methods [5].

another scheme has been recently proposed by bala-
subramanian and kraus [8] who use the einstein-hilbert
action with dirichlet boundary conditions for the met-
ric, supplemented by counterterms in order to ensure the
niteness of the stress tensor derived by the quasilocal
energy denition [9]. by adding a nite series of local
invariants of the boundary geometry, the counterterm
action regularizes that denition of energy. this idea
was subsequently extended to higher dimensions in [10].
a dierent, non-polynomial, expression has been given
in [11], which reduces to the previous one in the innite
cosmological constant limit.

in [12], an alternative construction is proposed which
yields the conserved charges in 3+1 dimensional general
relativity with negative cosmological constant and does
not need to specify the background provided it is alads.

ii. noether charges in 3+1 alads

gravity

the approach presented in [12] leads to a properly de-
ned, convergent expression for the noether charges in
3+1 dimensions, provided the alads boundary condi-
tion is imposed on the manifold. it is important to note
that the local ads behavior at the boundary is not equiv-
alent to the usual dirichlet condition over the metric, in
order to have a well dened variational principle.

the situation in 3+1 dimensions is reviewed in order to
set the basic facts in the construction. the starting ob-
servation is that the alads condition requires adding a
boundary term to the einstein-hilbert action equal to the
euler density (gauss-bonnet term) with a xed weight
factor, in order to cancel the boundary term coming from
the variation of the lagrangian. as a consequence, the
action, including the boundary term, is

i =

l2

4 z

m

abcd rab rcd,

(4)

where rab := rab + l2eaeb. the noether charge com-
puted with the action (4) has the right normalization
factor and is nite for 3+1 dimensional alads spaces.
this charge, associated with the invariance under a dif-
feomorphism of (4), is

q() =

l2

2 z



abcdiab rcd,

(5)

where  = x  x is the arbitrary vector eld1 that
generates the dieomorphism.

although komars formula and (5) are obtained as the
conserved noether charge associated with the same in-
variance, they disagree because the starting lagrangians
dier by a closed form and are deduced using second and
rst order formalism, respectively.
in order to clarify
this point, it is useful to split the charge (5) in such a
way that the relation with the usual tensor formalism
becomes explicit. q() can be written as

q() = k() + x() +

l2

2 z



abcdiabrcd,

(6)

where k() is given by (1), x() is a contribution due
to the local lorentz invariance2,

x() = 



2 z



abcdabeced,

(7)

the last term in (6) plays a double role:

with ab = ealeb
 and the last term arises from the
surface term in the action (which was set as l2
times
4
euler density). when  is a killing vector, ab can be
shown to be antisymmetric and be identied as a local
lorentz transformation. in the second order formalism
(7) is absent since there is no local lorentz invariance3.
it cancels
the divergences which appear in the explicit evaluation
of the solutions and contributes to the right normal-
ization factor as well. in this sense, this term regular-
izes the noether charge for alads spaces. this can be
checked explicitly in the following example: consider the
schwarzschild-ads solution and  = t. in the standard
frame choice ab is zero and hence x() vanishes. eval-
uating (6) yields

k() =

m

2here, the identity lea = da  ia
beb , which holds in
riemannian (torsion-free) manifolds has been used to obtain
(6).
3although it is always possible to choose a frame (ea) such
that ab = 0 in an open neighborhood, there could be in-
teresting cases where a global obstruction makes x() non-
trivial.

2

and hence, q() = m .

it is apparent from relations (8, 9), that the result (6)
remains unchanged if the limit l   is taken at the
end. this permits applying the formula equally well for
all values of the cosmological constant, including  = 0.
in this sense,  can be regarded as a regulator for general
relativity in the absence of cosmological constant.

in what follows, the extension of this approach to 2n-
dimensional gravity theories is presented. since in higher
dimensions, the einstein-hilbert (eh) action is not the
only option (see section iii below), we will also consider
a particular extension of the so-called lanczos-lovelock
actions, which has been dubbed the born-infeld (bi) ac-
tion [13]. this is an example that the formalism can be
applied to other theories of gravity that include higher
powers of curvature rab.

therefore, the action becomes stationary demanding  =

(15)

the r.h.s. of (14) can be recognized as the variation of

the 2n-dimensional euler density5

iii. einstein-hilbert action

a. action principle

e2n = nz

m

d [a1...a2na1a2 ra3a4...ra2n1a2n ] .

in this section a well dened rst order action principle
for eh lagrangian in even dimensional alads space-
times is proposed. as in 3+1 dimensions, the existence
of an extremum for alads spaces xes the boundary
term that must be added to the action as proportional
to the euler density. applying of noethers theorem to
this action yields a regularized, background-independent
expression for the conserved charges.

the action to be considered is

i = ieh + b

(10)

where ieh is the standard einstein-hilbert action with
negative cosmological constant in d = 2n dimensions,

ieh =



2(n  1) z

m

a1...ad(ra1a2 ea3 . . . ead

+

d  2
l2d

ea1 . . . ead),

(11)

and b is a boundary term4.

the on-shell variation of the action yields the bound-

ary term

where

i = z

m

,

thus, the boundary term in (10) reads

b = nz

m

e2n,

and the nal expression for the action supplemented by
the boundary term is

i = ieh + nz

e2n.

m

(16)

this particular form of action is our starting point for
the construction of the conserved charges. the topology
of the manifold is assumed to be m = r  .

the dieomorphism invariance is guaranteed by con-
struction because the action (16) is written in terms of
dierential forms. thus, noethers theorem provides a
conserved current (42) associated with this invariance
[see appendix], given by

 j = (ab, ea, ab)  il,

(17)

where ab = lab, and the lagrangian l can be read
from (16). then,  can be identied from (13) as

(12)

 = nna1...a2n la1a2 [ra3a4 ...ra2n1a2n

+ (1)n ea3...ea2n
l2n2 (cid:21) .

(18)

4here, wedge product  between dierential forms is un-
derstood. the gravitational constant has been chosen as
 =

with d2 the volume of sd2.

2(d2)!d2

5here we have dened the 2n-dimensional euler density as
e2n = a1...a2n ra1a2 ...ra2n1a2n . note that the normaliza-
tion adopted here diers from standard mathematical con-
vention as, for instance, in [14].

3

the useful identity lab = diab + irab allows writ-
ing the conserved current (17) as an exact form. thus,
the conserved charge can be written as

q() = nn z



a1...a2nia1a2 [ra3a4 ...ra2n1a2n

+ (1)n ea3...ea2n
l2n2 (cid:21) .

this expression can also be written as

q() = z



iabtab,

(19)

(20)

where, tab is the variation of the lagrangian with respect
lorentz curvature

q(


t

) = m.

(23)

 kerr-ads solution

in d = 2n dimensions, the rotating black hole solution
is labeled by the mass and n  1 parameters which are
related to the casimir invariants of so(d  1). the one
parameter kerr-ads spacetime, representing a solution
with mass and angular momentum along a single axis, is
given by the following choice of vielbein [15]

e0 = r(dt  a sin2()d)

e1 = 1
r

dr

e3 = sin()(adt  (r2 + a2)d) e2 = 1


d

(24)

ei = r cos()ei

tab =

l
rab

.

(21)

where i = 5 . . . d, ei is the vielbein for sd4 and

the general form adopted by the charge (20), can
in fact be used for any suitable gravitational theory 
possessing a unique cosmological constant, whose la-
grangian is a polynomial in the curvature rab and the
vielbein ea, and has the right boundary terms to ensure
the action to have an extremum for alads congura-
tions.

it is noteworthy that this formula has been derived
without making any assumptions about a background
geometry. the alads condition restricts only the lo-
cal asymptotic relation between the curvature and the
vielbein, with no mention of the global topology of the
manifold.

if  is a killing vector globally dened on the bound-
ary , the surface integral (19) is the mass when  = t.
similarly, for other asymptotic killing vectors, (19) gives
nite values for the linear and angular momentum for a
broad class of geometries. these statements are explic-
itly checked below for dierent alads spacetimes with
inequivalent topologies.

b. examples

 schwarzschild-ads black hole

the simplest example to be considered corresponds to
the d-dimensional black hole solution for the eh action
with cosmological constant, known as the schwarzschild-
ads geometry,

ds2 = (r)2dt2 +

dr2
(r)2 + r2d2

d2,

(22)

where (r)2 = 1  2m

rd3 + r2
l2 .

the only non-vanishing charge is associated with the
time-like killing vector t. evaluating (19) on this metric
yields

2

r =

(r2+a2)(1+ r2
22

l2 )2mr5d

2

 =

1 a2 cos2()

l2
22

2 = r2 + a2 cos2()
 = 1  a2
l2 .

(25)

this geometry has two non-vanishing noether charges,
one associated with the time-like killing vector t and
the rotational killing vector , respectively. for each
dimension, the conserved charges depend on the param-
eters m, a. for instance, in 6 dimensions the mass and
angular momentum are given by

q( 

t ) = m

2 q( 

 ) = ma
22 .

(26)

 (un)wrapped brane solution

unlike the schwarzschild-ads solution, where the
spherical symmetry implies a manifest ads asymptotic
behavior not only locally, but globally at the boundary,
another kind of alads geometry in d dimensions corre-
sponds to a brane solution with at transverse space,

ds2 = (r)2dt2 +

dr2
(r)2 + r2(dx2

1 + . . . + dx2

d2),

(27)

rd3 + r2

where (r)2 =  2m
l2 . in this geometry at least one
of the xi coordinates must be compact, otherwise the
parameter m can be absorbed by a coordinate transfor-
mation [16]. assuming that the volume of the transverse
space (xi) is equal to v , the noether charge associated
with the killing vector t is given by

q(


t

) = m

v

d2

,

(28)

4

and the corresponding charges related with spatial
iso(d  2) symmetries are zero.

it should be noted that (28) depends on the topological
nature of the transverse spatial section. in the case the
transverse space is compact, v is nite and so is the
resulting noether charge. when the transverse space is
non compact, the parameter m can be interpreted as a
mass density.

this method provides the correct results even for the
electrically charged extensions of the previous solutions.
it is straightforward to prove that the formula works
properly for the higher dimensional reissner-nordstrom
black hole, for the (3 + 1)-dimensional kerr-newman so-
lution, and for the electrically charged generalization of
the (un)wrapped brane (27) studied in [17].

iv. born-infeld action

in higher dimensions, besides the einstein-hilbert ac-
tion one can consider other gravitational theories that
include higher powers of the curvature and still yield sec-
ond order eld equations for the metric. among them,
there are a few that lead to well behaved alads solu-
tions [18]. in even dimensions (d = 2n), the born-infeld
(bi) action belongs to this class of theories. the bi ac-
tion takes the explicit form

i =

l2

2n z

m

a1...ad

ra1a2 . . . rad1ad ,

(29)

where rab = rab + l2eaeb. this theory is stationary for
alads solutions and no boundary terms are required in
order to have a well dened action principle6.

following the hamiltonian method, it would be ex-
tremely dicult to obtain a mass formula as a surface
integral for an arbitrary localized matter distribution in
this kind of theories. such construction would require
inverting the symplectic matrix of this action. however,
the rank of this matrix depends on the elds and there-
fore no general form can be found for an arbitrary eld
conguration. on the other hand, in the lagrangian for-
malism, the noether current for dieomorphisms is an ex-
act form, which allows writing down the conserved charge
at once as the surface integral

6this expression can also be written as

l = 2n1(n  1)!l2pdet(rab + l2eaeb),

and for this reason it has been dubbed the born-infeld action
[13].
in four dimensions, this action reduces to the usual
einstein-hilbert with cosmological constant plus the euler
density, with all coecient xed as in previous section.

q() = z



iabtab,

(30)

where

tab =

l2
2

aba3...ad

ra3a4 . . . rad1ad .

(31)

this is an appropriate denition of mass and other con-
served charges, as is shown in the following examples.

 static spherically symmetric solution

the spherically symmetric black hole solution of bi
action was studied in [19]. in 3+1 dimensions this is the
schwarzschild-ads geometry, but diers from it in higher
dimensions. the line element is given by

ds2 = (r)2dt2 +

dr2
(r)2 + r2d2

d2,

(32)

with (r)2 = 1 (cid:0) 2m
r (cid:1)

1

n1 + r2
l2 .

the mass is obtained by direct computation of (30) for

the killing vector  = t,

q(


t

) = m.

(33)

the conserved charges associated with rotational isome-
tries vanish.

 (un)wrapped brane solution

a feature in common for the bi and eh actions is
possessing a set of solutions that are only alads, but not
globally ads at the boundary. among many solutions, it
is interesting to consider the analog of the (un) wrapped
brane (27), for which the line element reads

ds2 = (r)2dt2 +

dr2
(r)2 + r2(dx2

1 + . . . + dx2

d2),

(34)

1

n1 + r2

with (r)2 = (cid:0) 2m
r (cid:1)

l2 . this corresponds to a
particular case of the class of geometries studied by cai
and soh in [20]. the transverse space in this gravitational
conguration is (locally) at, with a volume v . this ge-
ometry has just one non-vanishing noether charge, that
is the density of mass associated with the killing vector
t

q(


t

) = m

v

d2

.

(35)

this last result is in complete agreement with the one
computed by the hamiltonian method, using a mini-
superspace model applied to congurations with trans-
verse space not necessarily compact. however, this result
diers by a global factor compared to the same case as
treated in [20]. the origin of this mismatch lies in the fact
that transverse space is no longer spherically symmetric;
therefore, the volume v cannot cancel the normalization
factor, xed beforehand to give the correct value of mass
for spherically symmetric black holes.

v. conserved charge for lorentz

transformations

apart from charges associated with dieomorphisms
and due to the invariance of the eh and bi actions under
local lorentz transformations, the noether method can
also be applied to obtain conserved quantities for these
symmetries [see appendix]. substituting ab = dab
in the general expression for the noether current (42)

 j = abtab ,

(36)

where tab is covariantly constant, yields the conserved
charge in terms of the parameter of the lorentz transfor-
mation ab as

q(ab) = z



abtab.

(37)

here

tab = nnaba3...a2n [ra3a4...ra2n1a2n

+ (1)n ea3...ea2n
l2n2 (cid:21) ,

for einstein-hilbert case, and

when the space is not asymptotically at it is often nec-
essary to renormalize the asymptotic killing vectors to
dene the conserved charges (see, for example, [24]).

the resulting charges are nite for localized distribu-
tions of matter (black holes) and yield nite density for-
mulas for extended objects (e.g., strings). there is no
need to subtract the vacuum energy in order to regu-
larize the charges. it could be argued that the euler den-
sity added as a boundary term does this job for us, but
what is indisputable is the fact that one does not need to
specify a reference background against which one should
compute the value of the charges. what could be even
more surprising is the fact that the formulas (19), for eh
action, and (30) for bi the case, give the correct answers
even for radically dierent asymptotic behaviors.

the general nature of the treatment, allows extending
to 2n dimensions, and also to the bi action, the following
result valid for the eh action in (3+1)-dimensions with
negative cosmological constant: noether charges asso-
ciated to lorentz and dieomorphism invariance vanish
identically in locally ads spacetimes.

as can be directly checked from (19) and (37), the

(38)

charges are identically zero if

rab = rab + l2eaeb = 0

tab =

l2
2

aba3...ad

ra3a4 . . . rad1ad ,

(39)

for born-infeld action.

lorentz covariance

the formula (37) is a scalar from the point of view
of lorentz covariance. on the other hand, the charges
(30) and (19) associated with dieomorphism invariance
transform under local lorentz rotations as

q() = z



labtab.

(40)

this change in q() vanishes under the usual assump-
tion that the local transformation with parameter ab
approaches a rigid lorentz transformation on , con-
stant along , that is, lab| = 0.

vi. summary and prospects

the method presented here is the direct application
of noethers theorem to a rst order gravitational action
i[e, ], provided the spacetime satises alads bound-
ary conditions. the analysis leads directly to general an-
alytic expressions for the conserved charges, both for the
einstein-hilbert and born-infeld actions. the treatment
is entirely lagrangian and yields values for the charges
that match exactly those obtained by hamiltonian meth-
ods (e.g., adm). in the hamiltonian approach, however,

in the bulk. this means that spaces which are locally
ads have vanishing charges. in particular, any locally
ads geometry with a timelike killing vector should have
zero mass 7. this brings in an interesting issue: there
could be several topologically dierent spaces with locally
ads geometry for which all their quantum numbers as-
sociated to spatial transformations vanish. each of these
spaces could be reasonably used as vacuum for a quantum
eld theory and one should also expect to nd interpolat-
ing instanton or soliton congurations. also, any massive
solution such as the examples discussed above could be
seen as an excitation of the corresponding background in
the same topological sector.

prospects

only two cases (eh and bi) have been considered
here among all the possible lanczos-lovelock theories of
gravity [2123]. the suitable theories describing grav-
itation in higher dimensions must posses a unique cos-
mological constant and therefore, a unique background
in each topological sector, so that vacuum congurations
approach to local ads spacetimes with a xed curvature

7it should be stressed that this assertion is only valid in even
dimensions, for it is well known that at least in three dimen-
sions dierent locally ads spaces can have dierent energies
(m = 1 for ads, m  0 for black holes [25]). this probably
means that the analysis presented here cannot be repeated
verbatim in odd dimensions.

radius at the boundary [18]. indeed, there exists a subset
of these theories which possesses well behaved black hole
solutions [26]. the extension of this formalism to those
theories, in even dimensions, will be discussed elsewhere.
as mentioned above, the odd-dimensional manifolds
cannot be treated with the same method presented here.
the cases of interest in (2n + 1) dimensions, analogous
to those discussed in this note, would be eh and chern-
simons. regularization of the charges in these cases re-
mains an open problem in the presented framework.

another interesting problem to address is the classi-
cation of all 2n-dimensional constant curvature spaces,
as they can be thought of as candidates for vacuum con-
gurations for an ads eld theory. certainly, one possi-
ble class of such spaces could be ads with identications
along global killing vectors (that do not introduce causal
or conical singularities), but it is not obvious that this
exhausts all possibilities in high enough dimensions.

vii. appendix

a. noether theorem

in order to x the notation and conventions, here we

briey review noethers theorem.

consider a d-form lagrangian l(, d), where  de-
notes collectively a set of p-form elds. an arbitrary
variation of the action under a local change  is given
by the integral of

l = (e.o.m ) + d(, ),

(41)

where e.o.m. stands for equations of motion and  is
a corresponding boundary term [27]. the total change
in  ( = (x)  (x)) can be decomposed as a sum
of a local variation and the change induced by a dieo-
morphism, that is,  =  + l, where l is the lie
derivative operator.
in particular, a symmetry trans-
formation acts on the coordinates of the manifold as
x = (x), and on the elds as , leading a change in
the lagrangian given by l = d.

noethers theorem states that there exists a conserved

current given by

 j =   (, )  il,

(42)

which satises d  j = 0. this, in turn, implies the exis-
tence of the conserved charge

q = z
