abstract

we discuss topologically stable solitons in two-dimensional theories with
the extended supersymmetry assuming that the spatial coordinate is compact.
this problem arises in the consideration of the domain walls in the popular
theories with compactied extra dimensions. contrary to naive expectations,
it is shown that the solitons on the cylinder can be bps saturated. in the
case of one chiral supereld, a complete theory of the bps saturated solitons
is worked out. we describe the classical solutions of the bps equations. de-
pending on the choice of the kahler metric, the number of such solutions can
be arbitrarily large. although the property of the bps saturation is preserved
order by order in perturbation theory, nonperturbative eects eliminate the
majority of the classical bps states upon passing to the quantum level. the
number of the quantum bps states is found. it is shown that the n = 2 eld
theory includes an auxiliary n = 1 quantum mechanics, wittens index of
which counts the number of the bps particles.

1 introduction and physical motivation

the idea that our matter is made of zero modes trapped on the surface of a (1+3)-
dimensional topological defect (domain wall) embedded in a higher-dimension uni-
verse dates back to 1983 [1]. with the advent of supersymmetry and planckian
physics, it was natural to attempt to exploit [2] the setup for solving a wide range of
questions, such as building a fundamental theory at the scale much below planck-
ian, developing an appropriate pattern of supersymmetry breaking, and so on. the
bps saturated domain walls which preserve a part of the original supersymmetry,
play a special role. it was shown [2, 3] that the scalar and spinor matter, as well
as the gauge elds, can be localized on (1+3)-dimensional dynamical walls. the
next step was made in [4] where gravity was included in consideration. since the
gravitons are not localizable on dynamical walls, it was suggested that the original
multidimensional space-time is compact with respect to one or more coordinates, it
has the structure of a cylinder sk m4 (k  1), and the gravitons propagate in the
bulk. all other elds are still localized on the wall that appears dynamically on the
cylinder. the approach was later dubbed large extra dimension(s) theories. phe-
nomenologically it is preferrable [4] to have k = 2, the wall width of order, roughly,
1 (tev)1, and the radius of the cylinder of order 1 mm. for a recent discussion of
the emerging quite rich phenomenology see e.g. [5].

surprisingly, dynamical aspects of this construction have been investigated at
a rather fragmentary level.
in particular, the question of interest is the issue of
the bps saturation of the wall-like topological defects on the cylinder, which has
never been addressed in full previously. studying such topological objects is the task
of this work. since the domain wall is a static eld conguration depending on a
single coordinate, while other spatial coordinates are passive, this problem in many
aspects is equivalent to studying bps saturated solitons in two-dimensional theories
obtained by dimensional reduction of multidimensional theories. in other words, one
starts from d-dimensional theory, in which d  1 coordinates are spatial. the wall
solution depends on one of them. the presence of extra d  2 spatial dimensions
is irrelevant at the classical level (although it may be relevant at the quantum level).
the extra d  2 dimensions can be reduced. the two-dimensional theory obtained
in this way has an extended supersymmetry (susy). we will consider here the
generalized wess-zumino models, also referred to as the landau-ginzburg theories,
in two dimensions.

for instance, if one starts from (1+3)-dimensional wess-zumino model with
a discrete set of susy vacua, the walls are two-dimensional objects (two space
dimensions plus time) which can be assumed to lie in the yz plane. the wall prole
depends on x. if the original theory is considered in a noncompact space, m4, the
topological stability of the wall is achieved in a rather trivial manner. let 1 and
2 be two distinct degenerate vacua of the theory, v (1) = v (2) = 0, where
v is the scalar potential. then, the minimal energy solution (x) interpolating
between 1 at x =  and 2 at x = + is topologically stable. (here x is

1

the spatial coordinate.) such domain walls (solitons) always exist. they may or
may not be bps saturated. the issue of the bps saturation requires a separate
dynamical consideration [6]. a general theory of the bps saturated solitons in the
n = 2 landau-ginzburg models in this case was worked out in [7].
if the world sheet is a cylinder, r s, the situation with the topological stability
is dierent. indeed, x now becomes a compact coordinate. if the radius of s is r,
the points x and x + 2r are identied (we will also use the notation l = 2r and
will often put r = (2)1 in what follows, so that l = 1). to produce topologically
stable solitons, the dynamical theory under consideration must be such that the
eld  is dened on a manifold m with a noncontractible cycle or several distinct
cycles. if, as one winds around s, i.e. x varies continuously from x = 0 to x = l,
the eld  winds around a cycle of m, the corresponding eld conguration (x)
will be topologically stable [2]. unlike the theories on noncompact manifolds, the
topologically stable conguration described above need not be related to the vacua
of the theory. the latter may not exist at all (the run-away theories). thus, the
issue reduces to the classication of noncontractible closed contours 1 on m, i.e. the
fundamental group 1(m).

let us assume that a topologically stable soliton exists. can it be bps saturated?
as is well-known, the issue of the saturation is related to the existence of the central
charge(s) z in the superalgebra [8]. the nonvanishing central charge is a necessary
condition for the soliton to be saturated. since the spatial coordinate is compact
in our problem, (0) = (l), and the superpotential w is a holomorphic function
of , at rst sight one might conclude that z = |w [(0)]  w [(l)]| = 0, and
the saturated solitons are not possible.
it is
the dierential dw that must be a single-valued function (it determines the scalar
potential), the superpotential need not be single-valued. the superpotential w
can be a locally holomorphic function with branches. then the central charges are
determined by the integrals of dw over various noncontractible cycles on m, i.e. by
periods of the dierential dw ,

in fact, this conclusion is wrong.

zi = znc cyclei

dw .

(1)

the nonvanishing central charge is a necessary but not sucient condition for
the existence of the bps saturated soliton. we need to make two more steps.
first, we need to look for the static classical congurations that satisfy the bps
equations. then, we need to take into account quantum eects.
if the classical
bps conguration is isolated, one can construct a quasiclassical state around such
conguration. the perturbative quantum corrections would change the shape of
this quasiclassical state, but at the level of perturbative quantization, the modied
states would still be annihilated by half of the supercharges. at the same time,
due to nonperturbative quantum eects, not all these states may survive in the

1the space of all loops in m could be divided into classes such that loops inside each class can

be smoothly deformed into each other. such space of classes is denoted by 1(m ).

nonperturbative quantum theory  due to instanton-like phenomena, the half of
the supercharges that acted trivially at the classical level, may in fact start acting
nontrivially, connecting these states. then, such states cease to be bps saturated.
this phenomenon was rst observed by witten [9] in the interpretation of the morse
theory in terms of n = 1 supersymmetric quantum mechanics. the critical points of
the superpotential were quasiclassical bps congurations, and instantons provide
mixings between them.

the paper is organized as follows.

in sec. 2 we will study the space of the
classical bps congurations and present a heuristic evaluation of the number of
the bps states in the generalized landau-ginzburg models based on the properties
of cecottifendleyintriligatorvafa (cfiv) index [10]. we will show that only
vicinities of the poles of dw contribute to the bps solitons at the quantum level.

in the sec. 3 we will illustrate the general consideration of sec. 2 by a typical
example. in the sec. 4 we clarify the assertions made in sec. 2, without the use
of the cfiv index. we show that the n = 2 supersymmetric eld theory contains
within it an auxiliary n = 1 quantum mechanics, so that wittens index of the
latter counts the number of the bps solitonic states in the former. en route we show
that the localization to the poles of dw  phenomenon has analogs in the n = 2
supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the space with freely acting isometries (the
nonvanishing killing vectors).

2 a heuristic derivation of the number of bps
states in the generalized landauginzburg
model

2.1 generalized landau-ginzburg model and the classical

bps equations

the action of the generalized landau-ginzburg (glg) model, to be considered
below, has the form

s =

1

4 z d2x d4 k(i, j) +(cid:26)1

2 z d2x d2 w (i) + h.c.(cid:27) ,

(2)

where x = {it, x} ( = 0, 1) and x  s. moreover, i is a set of the chiral
superelds (corresponding to the holomorphic coordinates on the target space m),
the superpotential w is a (multivalued) analytic function of all chiral variables i,
while the kinetic term is determined by the kahler potential k, which is a real
(multivalued) function depending both on chiral i and antichiral j elds.

while w and k are multivalued, the kahler metric,

gij =

2 k
i j

and the 1-dierential  = idi,

i() =

w
i

(4)

are single-valued on the target space m. this is a necessary requirement, to be
imposed here and below. it ensures that the scalar potential and the fermion terms
in the lagrangian are well-dened.

in components the lagrangian takes the form

l =

n

xi,j=1(gij i  j + gij w

i

 j) + fermions ,

(5)

where n is the number of the chiral (antichiral) elds involved, and gij is the inverse
matrix,

gijgkj = k
i .

the equations of the bps saturation have the form

i = ei gij  w

where the dot denotes dierentiation over the spatial coordinate x. let us denote by
  m the loop in m that is the image of the map . then, the phase  appearing
in eq. (6) is that of the period,2

the formula (6) must be viewed as the master equation.

2.2 how to solve the bps equations for the one-dimensi-

onal target space

the general solution of eq. (6) for the one-dimensional target space could be divided
into two steps. at the rst step we will nd the space s of solutions (x, s) of eq. (6)
(s is the coordinate on the space s), which satisfy a modied periodicity condition,
(8)

(0, s) = (l(s), s) ,

for some function l(s).

imposing the condition

then, we will pick up the proper elements from s, the classical bps solitons, by

l(s) = l .

the requirement (9) determines (generally speaking) a discrete set of the parameters
{si} for which one deals with the classical bps solutions.

let us start from the rst step. the space s could be considered as a space of

imv ),

where g = 2k/ ;

v =

,

(ii) these curves do not touch the points where the vector eld v vanishes

(critical points of v ).

then, let us take such a closed curve s, and pick up some parametrization y on
it, so that the points on s have coordinates s(y), 0 < y < 1. now, we want to
nd such a change of parametrization y(x) that

solves eq. (6). substituting (10) into (6) we get

s(y(x))  (x, s)

the right-hand side of (11) is dened and positive if and only if the curve corre-
sponding to s is tangent to the vector eld v and does not touch its critical points
(where the right-hand side of (11) goes to +). in this case we can integrate (11)
to get a monotonous function x(y). the function l(s) is given by the integral of the
right-hand side from 0 to 1,

l(s) = z 1

(12)

here, we set y(0) = 0, y(l(s)) = 1. note, that the space s does not depend on the
nondegenerate changes of metric  such changes only aect the function l(s).
now, let us discuss the structure of s in more detail. the following fact is very
helpful  the vector eld v is orthogonal to the gradient of the multivalued function
i(, ),

i =

(note, that expression (13) is the integral of motion in the multidimensional problem,
with the arbitrary number of elds i, j.)

therefore, the closed curves tangent to v present a net of the level lines of i,

i.e. the curves s are described by the equation

i(s) = s .

(14)

at the same time, for the given s, the space of solutions of eq. (14) could have
several components, and not all of them would correspond to closed curves  some
of the components could even be noncompact (see sec. 3 for more details).

now, we can describe s as the space of pairs (s, a) where s is such that eq.
(14) contains at least one component that is a closed curve, and the index a just
numerates such components. from the description above we conclude that the space
s is an open space.
deformation (s + s), s,a,

in fact, for a pair (s, a), and the corresponding curve s,a(y), we construct its

i


s,a +

i
 

 s,a = s .

(15)

equation (15) can always be solved (for small s) because the closed curves do not
touch the space of zeroes of the gradient of i (that coincides with the space of zeros
of dw ). therefore, the allowed values of s is a union of nite intervals (sk, sk+1),
and, possibly, semi-innite intervals (, si) or (sf , +). it is also possible that
the allowed values of s form the full line (,).
to complete the description of the space s we should understand what happens
with the closed curve when s reaches its critical values. if m is compact, all critical
values sk have to be nite, and the critical curve sk,a(y) is a curve passing through
one of the critical points of dw .

in fact, as one can see from eq. (12), when the curve approaches a critical point
of dw , the derivative d w /d  in the denominator vanishes, so the integrand (and,
thus, the integral l(s)) tends to +.
if m is noncompact, we can think of it as of the space m with several points p
deleted. now, we will analytically continue dw to the points p keeping in mind
examining the behavior in these points.

if dw could be analytically continued to the point p, we could just add all such
points to the space m to get the space m1. suppose that there is a closed curve close
to the point p  then we expect that there is also a critical closed curve, with the
critical value sc passing through the point p. we expect that l(s) goes to innity
as s tends to sc. from the standpoint of m, the critical curve starts at innity
and ends there. (if l(sc) is nite this means that the manifold m is geodesically
noncomplete; we discard this possibility as an obvious pathology.)

another case to be considered corresponds to dw having a pole at p. then,
when s tends to one of the innities, the whole curve s,a runs away towards the

6

point p.
if the metric g can be smoothly continued to p then l(s) tends to
zero as s tends to the corresponding innity. (note, that if the metric g is also
singular at the point p, we have a competition, but we will not discuss such cases
of competition here.)

after the structure of s is determined, we complete the rst step of our search
for the classical bps congurations. the second step is to solve eq. (9) on s. note,
that the function l(s) depends on the choice of metric g, which can be taken to be
an arbitrary smooth nonvanishing function. therefore, the behavior of l(s) inside
the interval (sk, sk+1) is absolutely nonuniversal and can be chosen at will with the
appropriate choice of g. nevertheless, we understand the asymptotics of l(s) when
s tends to its critical values.

from the analysis above we see that if the critical value is nite, l(s) tends to
+. if the critical value is innite and the scalar potential tends to innity, then
l(s) tends to zero.
this knowledge is sucient to provide some information about the space of so-
lutions of eq. (9) which determines the classical bps congurations. this equation
has even number of solutions on nite intervals, odd number of solutions on semi-
innite intervals (, sk) and (sm, +), and even number of solutions in the special
case when the interval is (, +). note, that if the scalar potential does not grow
at innities, we do not know the number of solutions even modulo 2.

2.3 getting the quantum bps states from the classical

bps solutions

the quantum bps solitons of the two-dimensional theory correspond to such one-
particle states that are annihilated by half of the supercharges. it will be assumed
that the soliton particle is at rest, i.e. the states in the quantum theory with the
zero spatial momentum will be considered.

the bps particle states are annihilated by half of the supercharges, and thus,
form doublet representations (short multiplets) of the supersymmetry algebra [11].
the fact the supermultiplet of the bps solitons contains two states can be read-
ily seen within the quasiclassical quantization. a regular representation of n = 2
superalgebra in 1+1 dimensions is quadruplet  it contains two bosonic and two
fermionic states. this is seen, for instance, from the inspection of the chiral su-
pereld (xl, ). this can also be directly inferred from the analysis of non-bps
solitons in the quasiclassical approximation. indeed, such soliton is characterized
by the following collective coordinates: the soliton center x0 and four (complex)
fermion collective coordinates 1,2 and 1,2, reecting the nontrivial action of all
four supercharges when applied to the bosonic solution. upon quantization, the
collective coordinates are to be treated as (adiabatically) varying functions of time
x0(t), 1,2(t), 1,2(t). the quantum-mechanical (rst quantized) lagrangian takes
the form

l = m x2

0 + imj j ,

j = 1, 2 .

(16)

7

where m is the soliton mass, and the dot stands for the time derivative.
if 1,2
are the canonic coordinates, then i1,2 are the conjugate canonic momenta, which
determines the commutation relations

{i(t), j(t)} = ij .

(17)

the latter have a matrix representation in terms of four-by-four matrices, the hamil-
tanian is a four-by-four matrix, i.e. the dimension of the supermultiplet is four.
what changes upon the transition to the bps saturated soliton? two out of four
supercharges annihilate the soliton. correspondingly, only two supercharges act non-
trivially, and there are two fermionic collective coordinates,  and . again  is to be
treated as the canonic coordinate, i is the conjugate momentum. the commutation
relation which ensues is realized in terms of two-by-two matrices (   ,   +).
the dimension of the supermultiplet is two. this is the so-called shortened mul-
tiplet consisting of one bosonic and one fermionic soliton. the very existence of
the shortened multiplets is due to the central extension of the original superalgebra,
z 6= 0.
it is well-known that quantization around the classical bps congurations results
in the bps state in the perturbative quantum theory. in other words, every classical
solution (x, s), where s is determined from eq. (9), gives rise to a bps quantum
state order by order in perturbation theory. this is so because of the multiplet
shortening. naively, assuming that nonperturbative corrections to the perturbative
quantization do not change this, we get quite a weird picture of the bps states in
the model under consideration. their number is arbitrary, depending on details of
the metric g  even small variations of the metric could lead to the appearance of
new states or disappearance of the previously existing ones (see sec. 3 for details).
moreover, there is an analog of wittens index [12] that counts the number
of doublets in the centrally extended n = 2 superalgebra  the cecottifendley
intriligatorvafa index. this index is known to be independent of the metric (see
appendix), which contradicts our naive conclusion, based on the perturbative qua-
siclassical quantization, that the number of the quantum bps states equals the
number of the classical bps solutions.

what saves the day is the observation that the number of the classical bps
conguration modulo 2 is independent of the metric. this follows from the analysis
in the previous subsection. thus, we have to conclude that nonperturbative quan-
tum eects (like instantons in wittens quantum mechanics) lift the bps saturation
of the classical solutions and change the structure of the representations. short-
ened multiplets pair up; a pair of the doublet representations can form a regular
quadruplet (non-bps) representation. the supercharges which acted trivially at
the perturbative level start acting between the states that correspond to the classi-
cal bps congurations, making quadruplets from pairs of doublets. that is why the
number of doublets in the full quantum theory equals the number of quasiclassical
doublets only mod 2. pairing up of two classical bps solutions giving rise to a
non-bps quadruplet of quantum states can occur at strong coupling.

8

the mass shift from the bps bound is determined by the action of the eld
conguration (t, x) which smoothly interpolates between the two given classical
bps solutions 1(x) and 2(x), which pair up together. with the appropriate choice
of the metric, the barrier in the space of elds separating the two classical solutions,
can be made high. correspondingly, although the bps saturation will be lifted at the
(nonperturbative) quantum level, the mass of the quadruplet representation will be
dierent from the bps bound (i.e. from the central charge) only exponentially. we
should also note that in the problem of the domain walls (as opposed to solitons in
1+1 dimensions), the action is proportional, in addition, to the wall area. therefore,
the classical bps wall with the innite area remains bps at the quantum level too,
there is no tunneling.

finally, we note that using the independence of the cfiv index on the metric,
we can show that the nite intervals do not contribute to the cfiv index, while
each semi-innite interval gives contribution equal to 1. in fact, rescaling g  g,
we change the function l(s) to l(s). let l0 be the minimum of l(s) on the nite
interval. being an integral over the positive integrand, l0 > 0 . if  is larger than
l/l0, there are no classical bps congurations coming from the nite interval. if
we do the same on the semi-innite interval, then we will still get the contribution
from the region around innity, where l(s) tends to zero, and this contribution is
always 1.

2.4 multidimensional generalization

the consideration above can be generalized to the multidimensional case as follows.
if the manifold m is compact, then the space s of the periodic trajectories of eq.
(6) is bound by trajectories that pass through the critical points of dw . thus, the
function l(s), being positive inside s and tending to + at the boundaries, has
a nonzero minimum l0, and, as in the previous subsection, we can get rid of the
classical bps congurations by rescaling the kahler metric. therefore, due to the
cfiv index argument, there will be no quantum bps states.

now, suppose that m is noncompact, and it is obtained from the compact man-
ifold m by cutting out several submanifolds n of complex codimension 1. for
the sake of simplicity, in this paper we will restrict ourselves to the case where
submanifolds n are smooth and do not intersect with each other,

suppose that the 1-dierential dw has simple poles on these submanifolds,

m = m \ n .

z

dw = w ,

(18)

(19)

where  is a cycle in the vicinity of n that cannot be contracted to a point without
crossing n, i.e. it has a nontrivial linking with n.

9

we claim that the number of the bps states coming from the quantization of the
space c of the parametrized curves i(x) that could be deformed to  is bound
from below by the euler number of n.

let us study the space s of periodic trajectories in the space c. rescaling the

kahler metric

gij  gij

and taking  to + forces l(s) to go to + everywhere except for the curves in
the vicinity of n. thus, the problem is reduced to the vicinity of n that looks as
c   n, and the dierential is cd/, where  is the coordinate on c  = c \ 0.
let us take the metric g in the vicinity of n in the following form:

gij = gij

pr + tgij + o(t2) ,

(20)

where gij
pr is the inverse product metric, gij = 0 if i > 1, j > 1 or i = j = 1; gi1 = vi
and vi is a vector eld on n. for small t the trajectory starting at the point (, p ),
whose projection on c  is periodic, will be nonperiodic in the n direction. the
shift in this direction is proportional to vi(p ), i.e. to the value of the vector eld vi
at the point p on n. thus, the number of the periodic trajectories is given by the
number of the zeroes of the vector eld vi, i.e. it is bound from below by the euler
number of n.

3 a typical example

in this section we will consider a typical example that contains most of various cases
considered in sec. 2. consider

(22)

(23)

correspondingly, there are three noncontractible cycles, 1, 2 and 3 in fig.
1. the scalar potential is depicted in fig. 2. later on we will deform the kahler
potential in eq. (21) by adding a small perturbation. since dw/d vanishes only
at |im|  , the model has the run-away vacua. the soliton solutions stabilize
the theory, as in ref. [13]. the periods corresponding to the cycles 1, 2 and 3
are all equal to

in the problems with one variable , the fact of existence of the integral of
motion (13) is extremely helpful. by inspecting fig. 1, one immediately infers that
one can expect three solutions of eq. (6)  one connecting the points  =  and
 =  along the real axis of , and two other solutions winding around ()1,2. let
us discuss them in turn.

here,  = 0, which follows from eq. (24). and we omit the index s since in this
case s = i = 0, just a xed number.
in the problem at hand each trajectory is
in one-to-one correspondence with the value of i. so, we will label the trajectories
by the corresponding value of i instead of s in this section. we obviously have
l(i = 0) = 1, (as noted before, we set l = 1 here for convenience). the function
(x) is depicted in fig. 3, while the energy density corresponding to this solution
is plotted in fig. 4. of course, the center of the soliton (1/2 in eq. (25)) can be
chosen arbitrarily. as we will see shortly, this trajectory is exceptional.

the solitons corresponding to 2,3 can be established as follows. we will focus

on 2 since the solution for 3 is similar. the superpotential is obtained as

the interval i = (0,). following (14), we can get (x, i) implicitly from

imw (i) = i .

then, we can parametrize the corresponding closed curve i as i(y), 0 < y < 1 as
in sec. 2. then, from eq. (8), we can get l(i). let us write

 =  + i

where  and  are real functions of x. the condition

i(, ) = a positive constant

denes a family of trajectories (see sec. 2). practically, for each given trajectory
one can nd analytically i(x) and i(x) using the bps saturation equation

and then obtain l(i). the period function l(i) versus i is shown in fig. 6. the
solution corresponding to the bps soliton is obtained from the condition l(i0) = 1.
the energy density corresponding to the 2 soliton solution is shown in fig. 5. note
that we denote the class of the trajectories homotopical to the 1 cycle as the class
t1, such as the trajectories ,  in fig. 7 below, and the classes of the trajectories
homotopical to the 2, 3 cycles as the class t2, t3. and we know that the class t3
could be treated absolutely in the same way as the class t2.

thus, classically we have three bps soliton solutions preserving one half of su-
persymmetry. let us see what happens in the weak coupling regime. to this end
we introduce a small coupling constant g2 in the kahler metric,

k(, ) =

1
g2   .

one can view the factor 1/g2 as a deformed metric. the equation of the bps
saturation remains the same as in eq. (27), if, instead of the original variable x, one
introduces x = g2x. the dot will now denote dierentiation over x. the solution
is of the same type as discussed above with the constraint that the period in x is
g2  1 rather than unity. the bps saturation equations have no solution with
the small period for the trajectory along 1 . (we hasten to note, however, that a
nonsaturated solution of the classical equations of motion, winding around 1 with
the arbitrary period, always exists, as it is perfectly clear from the examination of
fig. 1.)

the bps saturation equations do have small period solutions for the 2,3 cycles.
the requirement l(i) = g2  0 implies that the trajectories wind around ()1,2
very close to ()1,2 (see fig. 6 and 7). then, say for the 2 cycle, dw/d can be
replaced by

this is precisely the solution which was rst obtained in ref. [13].

as was mentioned, the existence of the solution preserving one half of susy at
small coupling immediately translates at the quantum level into the presence in the
spectrum of the bps multiplet of particles. that such particles neither appear nor
disappear in the process of evolution from small g2 to g2 = 1 is guaranteed by the
cfiv index. at this point, one may think that there are three bps solutions at the
classical level and two bps solutions at the quantum level in this example. but it
was said in sec. 2.3 that the number of doublets in the quantum theory equals the

number of quasiclassical doublets only mod 2, which, at rst sight, contradicts this
example. however, one should notice that the classical bps solution corresponding
to the cycle 1 presents actually a degeneration of two solutions that are glued
together, which can be seen clearly from fig. 6 that the two solutions ,  are
glued together at the point corresponding to the 1 solution, so that the relative
fermion charges of these two solutions are arranged in such a way that their contri-
butions to the cfiv index cancel each other. therefore, this example is indeed in
agreement with the analysis of sec. 2.3.

summarizing, in the given sample problem, with three noncontractible cycles
in the target space, we found three distinct soliton supermultiplets. two of them,
corresponding to the trajectories winding around the poles of dw/d, are bps
saturated (short multiplets, one half of supersymmetry is preserved). the soliton
corresponding to the 1 cycle is not saturated, in spite of the fact that classically
one can nd a solution of the bps saturation equations in strong coupling at certain
(isolated) values of g2. the classical solution is not elevated to the quantum level.

4 the quantum mechanical explanation of in-
stantonic corrections to the quasiclassical bps
states

consideration of sec. 2 may leave a wrong impression that the phenomenon of
localization to the poles of dw in the computation of the number of the bps doublets
is quite specic to d = 2 theories. in this section we will show that (as it always
happens with phenomena in the computation of various index-like quantities) this

phenomenon is a special case of a more general phenomenon that occurs in n =
2 quantum mechanics with the target space with isometry (the killing vector).
moreover, we will show that the mysterious nonperturbative corrections mentioned
in sec. 2 could be easily understood as instantonic corrections in wittens n = 1
quantum mechanics associated with the n = 2 quantum mechanics on the target
space with isometry.

4.1 doublets of n = 2 (d = 2) superalgebra and ground

states of associated quantum mechanics

the algebra of supersymmetries of the n = 2 two-dimensional eld theory has the
following form:

{q, q} = h  p , {q+, q} = z , { q+, q} = z .

(31)

here p is the momentum operator in the x direction, h is the hamiltonian, the
operators z and z are complex conjugate to each other and are called the central
charges. the subscripts + and  of the supercharges denote that they have the
charges +1/2 and 1/2 under the so(1, 1) lorentz group. operators without the
bar are the chiral supercharges, while those with the bar antichiral ones.
to simplify the study of the representations of the algebra (31), we will make

the following redenition:

q1 = q+, q1 = q+, q2 = q, q2 = q .

(33)

(34)

we are interested in the states that represent particles at rest, so we will restrict
ourselves to the representations with p = 0.

in the irreducible representations of the algebra (33), h and z are represented by
numbers e and z. we are interested in such representations that z 6= 0. then the
irreducible representation is either 4-dimensional, if the matrix n is nondegenerate,
or two dimensional, if the matrix n has a zero eigenvalue. the latter happens if
and only if

z = eie ,

(35)

where  is a real constant. the shortening of the irreducible representation could
also be interpreted as follows. the n = 2 algebra contains, as a subalgebra, the
following algebra of an associated n = 1 quantum mechanics:

{q, q} = h ,

where

q = q1 + eiq2, q = q1 + ei q2, h = 2h + eiz + ei z .

(36)

(37)

then, the doublet representations of the algebra (33) are in one-to-one corre-
spondence with the ground states of the associated n = 1 quantum mechanics
(36).

4.2 the representation of the n = 2 (d = 2) algebra from
the representation of the n = 2 quantum mechanics
on the target space with an isometry

let us start from the conventional superalgebra of n = 2 quantum mechanics

(38)
the n = 2 quantum mechanics, obtained by dimensional reduction of the gener-
alized landau-ginzburg theory, provides the following representation of the algebra
(38).

{q1,0, q1,0} = {q2,0, q2,0} = h .

consider the cliord algebra

{i

j
+, 

+} = gij;

{i

j
, 

} = gij.

(39)

then, the algebra (38) has the following representation:

q+,0 = q1,0 =

suppose that the target space has an isometry that preserves both the metric and
the one-dierential. it means that there is a real killing vector eld 3

vm = (vi, vi) ,

and the lie derivative along this real vector eld lv + lv leaves both the metric g
and the dierential  invariant. here lv acts on the (k, l) tensor as follows:

lvti1...ik,j1,...,jl = vj 

j ti1...ik,j1,...,jl +

note, that the antiholomorphic derivatives are absent in (43) due to holomorphy of

using this vector eld, we can modify the representation of n = 2 supersym-
metric quantum mechanics in such a way that it represents the algebra of n = 2
(d = 2) supersymmetry in the following way:

q1 = q+ = q+,0 +

q2 = q = q,0 +

q1 = q+ = q+,0 +

q2 = q = q,0 +

and antiholomorphic (i) values.

(44)

(45)

while the central term

z = vii .

(46)

note that eq. (43) implies that z is a constant.

now, let us have a closer look at the associated n = 1 quantum mechanics. in

particular, if we introduce

then the supercharge q takes the form:

one can check that  is closed, i.e.

(here, as above, m = (i, i).) in the computation of wittens index one can
continuously change the superpotential (in a way preserving discretization of the
spectrum). therefore, we can study a family of the i() as the following

i() = eii +

(49)

as it is well known, the classical ground states correspond to zeroes of (). let
us tend  to +. at rst, suppose that target space is compact. then, the zeroes
of () tend to the zeroes of v, and if v has no zeroes, wittens index is equal to
zero. now, suppose that the target space is not compact, and  has poles on its
compactication. then, as  tends to +, the position of the zeroes of () tends
to the position of the poles, and the computation of wittens index is reduced to
the computation in the vicinity of the poles.

4.3 n = 2 (d = 2) field theory as n = 2 quantum mechan-

ics on the loop space

the two-dimensional generalized landau-ginzburg model, as the quantum theory
in the given winding sector, is an n = 2 quantum mechanics on the corresponding

19

loop space modied by the vector eld that rotates the loop. various aspects of this
phenomena were studied previously in [14, 15, 16, 17].

the coordinates on the loop space are

i,x = i(x) .

the vector eld vi,x generated by x  x +  is
i(x)

vi,x =

x

.

(50)

let us see how this modies the supercharges. for example, q+ takes the fol-

lowing form (the sum over the continuous index x is replaced by the integral)

q+ = z dx(

(51)
however, this is exactly the supercharge of the d = 2 generalized landauginzburg
eld theory.

now, we check how the formula for the central charge works in this formalism,

z = xi,x

vi,xi,x = z dw

d

dx ,

(52)

in full agreement with the computation performed in sec. 2. one can check that the
zeros of the derivative of the superpotential of the associated quantum mechanics
are nothing but the closed bps trajectories!

so, we conclude that the nonperturbative phenomena that were anticipated in
sec. 2 actually exist in the form of the witten instantonic transition in the associated
n = 1 quantum mechanics on the loop space.

5 conclusions

in the theories with the large extra dimensions [4]  a popular subject of theoretical
studies at present  one has to deal with the domain walls on the manifolds of
the cylinder type. the issue of the bps saturation versus nonsaturation of these
domain walls is of the paramount importance. the dynamical part of this problem
obviously reduces to the analysis of two-dimensional eld theory with the extended
supersymmetry on r  s.
here we addressed the dynamical question of the existence of the bps saturated
states within the framework of the generalized wesszumino (or landauginzburg)
models, describing the interaction (possibly, eective) of one or more chiral super-
elds. since in such models the central charge z  w, nonvanishing central
charges are impossible, at rst sight. we explained where this naive point of view is

20

wrong, and presented the theory of the bps saturated states, both at the classical
and quantum levels.

we revealed nonperturbative eects lifting the bps saturation for the classical
bps solutions. it is shown that at the quantum (nonperturbative) level the bps
states can exist only if the target space of the landau-ginzburg model considered is
noncompact. using various index-related tools we found the number of the quantum
bps particles in the theories with one chiral supereld, and the lower bound on this
number for more than one chiral supereld.

appendix: the cfiv index is independent of the
d terms

the conventional wittens index is known to be independent of any small smooth
deformations of the supersymmetric theory. this is not true for the cfiv index.
still, this index is independent of the continuous variations of the d terms, i.e. terms
in the hamiltonian that are equal to

{q+, [ q, r]} = {q1, [q2, r]}

or to

{q, [ q+, r]} = {q2, [q1, r]}

with some operators r and r. say, a small variation of r, h = {q1, [q2, r]},
results in the following variation of the cfiv index:

icfiv = tr (1)f f exp(th){q+, [ q, r]}(t)

= tr (1)f f exp(th)(cid:16)q+[ q, r] + [ q, r]q+(cid:17) (t) .

(a.1)

21

now, we take q+ in the second term, put it to the leftmost position inside the trace,
and then drag to the right, using the fact that

q+(1)f f = (1)f q+f = (1)f q+  (1)f f q+ .

in this way we get

icfiv = tr (1)f exp(th)q+[ q, r](t) .

(a.2)

repeating the same operation with q yields icfiv = 0 since q+ anticommutes
with q.
