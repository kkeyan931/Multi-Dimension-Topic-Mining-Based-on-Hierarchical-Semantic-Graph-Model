the innite dimensional generalization of the quantum mechanics of extended objects, namely,
the quantum eld theory of extended objects is employed to address the hitherto nonrenormaliz-
able gravitational interaction following which the cosmological constant problem is addressed. the
response of an electron to a weak gravitational eld (linear approximation) is studied and the order
 correction to the magnetic gravitational moment is computed.

i. introduction

the quantum mechanics of extended objects [1] and its innite dimensional generalization, namely, the quantum
eld theory of extended objects, have been presented by the author in connection with the scalar eld and quantum
electrodynamics with the pauli term [2] [3]. it is evident that the quantum eld theory of extended objects appears
to successfully address the issue of nonrenormalizability in these cases. in this paper we focus our attention on one
of the most important of the nonrenormalizable interactions, namely, the quantum theory of gravity. we employ the
extended object formalism to render quantum gravity nite following which we present the solution to the cosmological
constant problem. it is found that the extended object formulation naturally aords small values for the cosmological
constant, indeed, much smaller than the observational bound. the response of an electron to a weak gravitational
eld (linear approximation) has hitherto not been amenable to a solution because of the nonrenormalizable nature
of quantum gravity. we examine this problem using the quantum eld theory of extended objects and compute the
order  correction to the magnetic gravitational moment which arises due to the motion of masses in the eld

ii. the gravitational field

apart from string theory, recent approaches to quantum gravity have been surveyed by isham et al. [4] [5]. the
traditional approach to gravity has been to start with the einstein-hilbert action in geometrized units with g = c =
h = 1

s = z d4xgr.

(2.1)

the process of quantization is begun by power expanding the metric tensor around some classical solution g(0)
equations of motion:

 of the

g (x) = g(0)

 + h

(2.2)

where h is the graviton eld. the classical metric is usually taken to be the lorentz metric. by means of the
transformation t  it we can also choose g(0)
 will refer
to the euclidean metric. given the expansion eq. (2.2) we can also expand the christoel symbols, and hence the
entire action, in a power series in h . each term of the series contains two derivatives and an increasing number of
h elds and powers of the negative dimensional coupling constant. the existence of a negative dimensional coupling
constant is the origin of the problem of the nonrenormalizability of gravity. if we introduce a linear approximation
then general relativity reduces to the theory of a massless spin 2 eld. the lagrangian in this approximation reduces
to:

 to be the euclidean metric [6]. henceforth, in this section, g(0)

l0 =

1

4 (cid:2)(h)2 + (h)2  2hh + 2hh(cid:3) .

(2.3)

by a suitable choice of gauge we obtain the euclidean graviton propagator as:

1

 +   

k2 + i

.

(2.4)

the full theory of general relativity may be viewed as that of a massless spin 2 eld which undergoes a nonlinear self
interaction. as is well known this propagator fails to renormalize the theory.

apart from the tensor indices the propagator given in eq. (2.3) can be viewed as the massless limit of the ordinary
euclidean scalar eld propagator. starting from the quantum mechanics of extended objects the author has derived
a propagator for the scalar eld

d(p) =

ep2/m2
p2 + m2

(2.5)

which successfully renormalizes the hitherto nonrenormalizable 6 interaction [2]. the derivation of this propagator
involves the characterization of virtual particle intermediate states as fuzzy particle states. the preservation of crucial
properties such as causality, lorentz invariance, and unitarity have been discussed by the author in the context of the
scalar eld. by taking the massless limit of eq. (2.5) and introducing tensor indices we propose a euclidean graviton
propagator (retarded) of the form:

( +   )

ek2/m2

k2

(2.6)

where 1
universe and h is the hubble constant. the corresponding propagation amplitude is given by

m is the graviton compton wavelength given by 6.7  104r where r = c/h is the hubble radius of the

h0|h(x)h(y)|0i = ( +   )z

d4k
(2)4

ek2/m2

k2

eip(xy).

(2.7)

the right hand side of eq. () is symmetric under x  y (just change k  k) implying that [h(x), h(y)] = 0.
the vanishing of the commutator can be explained by observing that h(x) is a eld which creates and destroys 4-
momentum states (or mass states when on shell) [2]. since these states are relativistic invariants the measurement of
a eld which creates such states at one spacetime point cannot aect its measurement at another spacetime point. in
the limit of vanishing compton wavelength we obtain the usual propagator (retarded) which is the greens function for
the linearized equations of motion. a crucial feature of this propagator is the gaussian damping term which eliminates
the high frequency modes and renders scattering amplitudes and n-point functions nite. in this approach, h(x)
admits an expansion only as a sum over 4-momentum states and this fact is crucial in preserving causality. in the
context of the scalar eld the author has shown that the absence of 3-momentum characterizations for fuzzy particle
states coupled with the fact that we are generalizing to innite dimensions a causal formulation, namely, the quantum
mechanics of extended objects, preserves the statement of causality [2]. since we are taking the massless limit of the
scalar eld causality will also be preserved in this case. in this paper we do not prove unitarity but appeal directly to
experimental verication by calculating the magnetic gravitational moments which arise due to the motion of masses
in the eld. it is suggestive that the euclidean scalar eld propagator given in eq. (2.5) has been shown to preserve
unitarity in the hitherto nonrenormalizable 6 theory [2]. before we proceed to study the response of an electron
to a weak gravitational eld using the graviton propagator we have arrived at, we focus our attention on another
important problem, namely, the cosmological constant problem.

iii. the cosmological constant problem

a major crisis facing physics is the cosmological constant problem: theoretical expectations for the cosmological
constant exceed observational limits by about 120 orders of magnitude. a good review of the problem and various
attempts at its solution have been given by weinberg [7]. the observational limit on the cosmological constant 
obtained by measurement of cosmological red shifts as a function of distance is given by

 < 1047gev 4.

(3.1)

according to einstein, the energy-momentum tensor of matter  id the source of the gravitational eld. a vacuum
energy density h0|h|0i =  contributes to this source a term

 = n ( ) + g

(3.2)

2

where the rst term on the right is subtracted to have zero expectation value [8]. the vacuum energy term has
the form of einsteins cosmological constant and this potentially aects the expansion of the universe. consider the
hamiltonian for the scalar eld of mass m

where  is a high momentum cut o,   m. if we choose the cuto  at the planck mass mp = 1019 gev we obtain
(3.5)

 = 2  1071gev 4

the canonical commutation relations arise from the quantum eld theory of point particles in which the nite extent
of a particle is neglected. when we take the cut o at the planck mass mp in eq. (3.4) we are eectively bounding
the short distances by the planck length lp = 1033 cm. if we incorporate the nite extent of the eld particle of
mass m into the physics we would need to place an eective lower bound on the short distances given by the compton
wavelength 1
m and not by the planck length. this lower bound can be large depending on the mass of the eld
particle. from the quantum eld theory of extended objects we have the noncanonical commutation relations:

(cid:2)ap, a

q(cid:3) = ep

2/m2

(3)(p  q)

(3.6)

these commutation relations smear out the particles 3- position and by imposing them we obtain the zero point
energy and hence  as

 = z

(3.7)

we observe that a high momentum cut o is not required to make the integral convergent since the integral has a
natural cut o at the compton wavelength of the eld particle 1
m . the short distances are now bounded by the
compton wavelength and therefore the cosmological constant becomes dependent on the mass of the eld particle.
by making use of the observational limit given in eq. (3.1) we obtain an upper bound for the particle mass as

m < 5  1012gev = 5  103ev

(3.8)

if we exclude the possibility of the existence of matter elds and for that matter the electromagnetic eld in empty
space and if we assume that the gravitational eld permeates all of empty space we can always choose m to be the
graviton mass which has an upper limit of 2  1029 ev [9]. hence, the vacuum energy density of empty space which
is proportional to the cosmological constant is well below the observational limit (by about 70 orders of magnitude)
and the cosmological constant is pushed even closer to zero [10]. thus, the extended object formulation is able to
predict a small value for the cosmological constant in a natural way. we now proceed to study the response of an
electron to a weak gravitational eld.

when gravity is weak the linear approximation to general relativity should be valid.

then a satises precisely the maxwell equations in the lorentz gauge [11]. this is because the

where j = tt is the mass-energy current density 4-vector and
t = 2t(j)  tt

(4.3)

(4.4)

is the stress-energy tensor approximated to linear order in velocity. if we assume that the time derivatives of h are
negligible, then the space-space components of h (which satisfy the source free wave equation) vanish, and we nd
that to linear order in the velocity of the test body, the geodesic equation now yields

a = e  4v  b

(4.5)

where e and b are dened in terms of a by the same formulas as in electromagnetism [11]. thus, linearized gravity
predicts that the motion of masses produces very similar eects to those of electromagnetism. it is our goal to give
precise meaning to these statements. to that end, let us write down the lagrangian for gravitodynamics in terms of

which couples to the eld in this case. if we compute the gravitational moment we nd that it is given by

(4.8)

where g = 2 + 2f2(0) is the lande g-factor, s is the electron spin, and f2(0) is the order  correction to the g-factor.
to lowest order f2(0) = 0 ad we nd that the magnetic gravitational moment is roughly 12 orders of magnitude
smaller than corresponding electromagnetic moment. in order to calculate the order  correction we need to compute
the diagram shown in gure 1. we have expressed our graviton eld in terms of the vector eld a. hence, we
make use of a retarded, massless vector boson propagator analogous to the photon propagator but with the gaussian
damping term given by:

where m = m2/4. in order to get an estimate of the value of f2(0) we can numerically evaluate the integral at
zeroth order in p we obtain a bound for f2(0) as

this value represents the order  correction to the lande g-factor for the magnetic gravitational moment. due to the
weak nature of the gravitational interaction the correction is extremely small and its experimental verication will
require very high precision tests.

f2(0) = 2.0975  1062.

v. conclusion

by quantizing the gravitational eld using the quantum eld theory of extended objects we are able to successfully
explain why the cosmological constant should be close to zero.
in addition, we are able to compute the order 
correction to the magnetic gravitational moment. the calculated value of the order  correction must be subjected
to experimental tests.
