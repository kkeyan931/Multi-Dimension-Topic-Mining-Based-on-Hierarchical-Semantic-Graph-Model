abstract

we study a zz2 orbifold of type 0b string theory by reection of six of the coordinates
(this theory may also be thought of as a zz4 orbifold of type iib string theory by a rotation
by  in three independent planes). we show that the only massless mode localized on the
xed fourplane ir3,1 is a u (1) gauge eld. after introducing d3-branes parallel to the xed
fourplane we nd non-supersymmetric non-abelian gauge theories on their worldvolume.
one of our results is that the theory on equal numbers of electric and magnetic d3-branes
placed at the fourplane is the zz4 orbifold of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory by
the center of its r-symmetry group.

1. introduction

the discovery of ads/cft correspondence [1,2,3] has led to new insights into four

dimensional gauge theories. in particular the results on d3-branes near orbifold singular-
ities [4] naturally lead to quotients of the basic n = 4 duality by discrete subgroups of
the su (4) r-symmetry [5,6]. a closely related development has been the study of gauge

theories on d3-branes of type 0b theory, which is an nsr string with the non-chiral gso

projection (1)f + f = 1 which breaks all spacetime supersymmetry [7]. type 0b string

can also be studied in the gs framework, as we show below.

the type 0a and 0b models have twice as many massless rr elds as their type ii

cousins, hence they also possess twice as many d-branes [8]. for example, since type 0b

spectrum has an unrestricted 4-form gauge potential, there are two types of d3-branes:

those that couple electrically to this gauge potential, and those that couple magnetically.

very importantly, the weakly coupled spectrum of open strings on type 0 d-branes does
not contain tachyons after the gso projection (1)fopen = 1 is implemented [8,9,10].
thus, gauge theories living on such d-branes do not have obvious instabilities at weak

coupling. this suggests via the gauge eld/string duality that the bulk tachyon instability

of type 0 theory may be cured as well [8,11].

the simplest example of ads/cft duality in a type 0 context follows from consid-

ering n electric d3-branes coincident with n magnetic ones [11]. for such a stack the net

tachyon tadpole cancels so that there exists a classical solution with t = 0. in fact, since

the stack couples to the selfdual part of the 5-form eld strength, the type 0b 3-brane

classical solution is identical to the type iib one. taking the throat limit suggests that the
low-energy eld theory on n electric and n magnetic d3-branes is dual to the ads5  s5
background of type 0b theory and is therefore conformal in the planar limit [11]. this
theory is the u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory coupled to six adjoint scalars of the rst u (n ),
six adjoint scalars of the second u (n ), and weyl fermions in the bifundamental repre-

0

sentations  four in the (n, n) and four in the (n, n) (the u (1) factors decouple in the
infrared). this theory is a zz2 projection of the n = 4 u (2n ) gauge theory [11]. the
zz2 is generated by (1)fs, where fs is the fermion number, together with conjugation by
(cid:18) i
0 i (cid:19) where i is the n  n identity matrix. this is related to the fact that type
0 string theories may be viewed as (1)fs orbifolds of the corresponding type ii theories
[7]. in [12] it was pointed out that (1)fs is identied with an element of the center of
the su (4) r-symmetry, hence this zz2 projection of the n = 4 theory belongs to the class
studied in [5,6]. in particular this observation explains why the theory is conformal in the

large n limit (this follows from the arguments of [13]), and also why the dual string theory

1

background is ads5  s5  the reason being that the orbifold group zz2 belongs to the
spin cover of the lorentz group and projects to identity in the rotation group. therefore
the geometry is not aected by the quotienting.

in view of this observation it is of further interest to study the quotient of the maxi-

mally supersymmetric theory by the full center zz4 of su (4) [12]. this theory has

 the gauge group u (n )4 coupled to a chiral eld content:
 four quadruples of bi-fundamental fermions transforming in (ni, ni+1), i = 0, 1, 2, 3;

4  0,

 four sextets of bi-fundamental scalars in (ni, ni+2).

can this gauge theory be embedded into string theory? since the generator of zz4 changes
the sign of the six scalar elds in the n = 4 multiplet, a good guess is that this theory
occurs on d3-branes of type 0b theory orbifolded by reection of six spacetime coordinates
[12]. in this paper we conrm this guess and also derive some further properties of this zz2
orbifold of type 0b theory (more general orbifolds of type 0b were studied in [14,15]).
one interesting result is that the only massless mode on the xed fourplane ir3,1 is a
photon. after d3-branes are added, this u (1) gauge eld couples to the the theory on
the d3-branes, and we comment on some features of this coupling. we regard this as an
interesting non-supersymmetric analogue of what happens in orbifolding type iib theory
by reection of four of the coordinates. there we nd a tensor theory on the xed six-plane
ir5,1.

2. the eld theories.

our goal is to study a certain zz4 orbifold of type iib string theory.1 let us consider
the orbifold of type iib theory by the zz2 reection of six out of ten space-time coordinates:

x m  x m , m = 4, . . . , 9 .

(2.1)

under the corresponding breaking of the lorentz group so(1, 9)  so(1, 3)  so(6) the
ten-dimensional mayorana-weyl spinors decompose as:

16 = 2so(1,3)

c

 4so(6) .

the transformation (2.1) acts on the space-time spinors via multiplication by i and this
zz2 becomes actually zz4  su (4) = spin(6).

1 notice that there are many possibilities of embedding the group zz4 into the global symmetry
group of the type iib string theory. we consider the embedding which does not break the global

symmetry.

2

the generator of this zz4 is a rotation by  in the 45, 67 and 89 planes, exp i(j45 +
j67 + j89). this group has a zz2 subgroup generated by exp 2i(j45 + j67 + j89). if we
orbifold the type iib string theory by this zz2 then we get the type 0b string. indeed, it
is known that 0b is an orbifold of iib by (1)fs where fs is the spacetime fermion number
[7], and exp 2i(j45 + j67 + j89) acts on all elds as (1)fs. the subsequent orbifolding
of type 0b string by exp i(j45 + j67 + j89) is actually a zz2 operation because the theory
has no fermions in its spectrum. thus, the theory we are studying may also be thought of
as a zz2 orbifold of type 0b string by reection of six coordinates (2.1).

the same conclusion applies to the eld theory on d3-branes. take n d3-branes

placed at the xed point of the discrete group. the theory induced on the world volume

of these branes will have four u (n ) gauge groups, four quadruples of bi-fundamental
fermions transforming in (ni, ni+1), four sextets of bi-fundamental scalars in (ni, ni+2),
i = 0, 1, 2, 3; i  i + 4 [12].

one of our new results is that this theory can be obtained as a slightly unnatural
zz2 orbifold of the eld theory living on the collection of n self-dual threebranes in type
0b theory. in that theory we have two u (n ) gauge groups, two quadruples of fermions
12  (n1, n2), 21  (n2, n1), and two sextets of adjoint scalars 1, 2. this theory
has a symmetry:

(cid:18) 1
2(cid:19) 7 (cid:18)1
2(cid:19) ,

(cid:18) 12
21(cid:19) 7 (cid:18)12

21 (cid:19) .

(2.2)

indeed the yukawa couplings are of the form 11221 and 22112, hence they are
invariant under (2.2). if we add the standard action of zz2 on chan-paton indices (i.e.

sending n  2n and conjugating by (cid:18) i
0 i (cid:19) in both of the u (2n ) groups, where i is
the n  n identity matrix) then the resulting theory has the correct eld content and the
interactions to be identied with the zz4 orbifold of the n = 4 theory.

3. closed string theory

3.1. zz4 orbifold of type iib in the gs formalism

let us consider the type iib string theory in the green-schwarz formalism. in the

light cone gauge the action looks like:

s = z d d(cid:16)+x ix i  isa+sa  i sa sa(cid:17)

(3.1)

where the fermions sa, sa transform in 8s of spin(8), and the scalars x i are in 8v.

3

now let us rewrite this action in the form where the su (4) invariance is manifest. to

this end we introduce the complex fermions:

bm = 2(cid:0)s2m + is2m1(cid:1) ,

bm = 2(cid:16) s2m + i s2m1(cid:17) , m = 1, 2, 3, 4

(3.2)

the scalars are represented as:

x i = (cid:0)x, x, x mn = x nm(cid:1) ,

m, n = 1, . . . , 4

(3.3)

the action (3.1) is rewritten as:

s = s(x, x)  ixm z (cid:16)b m+bm + b mbm(cid:17) +

1

4 x mnkl+x klx mn

(3.4)

we wish to perform the orbifold projections with respect to the center of su (4).
naturally we get four sectors.
untwisted sector. in this sector all x is and bm, bm are integer moded. the zero point
energy vanishes both in left and right sectors and the projection of the massless modes
gives:

so(8) :

(8v  8c)  (8v  8c) 

su (4) : 6  6m 4 (1  1)m 4  4m 4  4

so, all space-time fermions are projected out, while out of bosons we have got the com-
ponents of the metric and b-eld tangent to the xed plane (4 (1  1)), orthogonal to the
xed plane plus the dilaton (6  6), and components of the rr forms which are either
transverse or longitudinal with respect to the xed plane.
twisted sectors. x, x are always integer moded. they contribute  1
energy both on the left and on the right.
twists by i:

12 to the zero-point

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

x mn( + 2) = x mn()
bm( + 2) = ibm()
bm( + 2) = ibm()
the zero-point energy of the states |  iil,r is given by

el = er = 

1

+ 3(

1
12

+

1
2

1
22 ) + 4(

1
12 

1
2

3
42 ) = 0

so we get a massless mode for both +i and i sectors. later we will see that these states
are not scalars but, somewhat surprisingly, the positive and negative helicity components
of a photon in 3 + 1 dimensions.

4

notice that the next excited levels have l0 = l0 = 1

4 and transform in the rank two

tensor representations of su (4):

bm
 1
b m
 1

4| + iil  bn
4|  iil  bn

 1

 1

4| + iir  4  4
4|  iir  4  4

(3.8)

twist by 1: all bosons are periodic, the fermions are anti-periodic. the zero point energy
is negative:

el = er = 4(

1
2

1
22 ) = 

1
2

(3.9)

so the ground state | 1il |  1ir is tachyonic. in the nsr language this is the tachyon
from the (n s, n s) sector of type 0b string. the next level is massless:

sa

2 |  1il  sb

2 |  1ir

(3.10)

and before the projection gives rise to the extra set of rr even forms, just like in type
0b theory. after the projection it doubles the set of forms we got in the untwisted sector,

i.e. we get extra 4  4l 4  4.

so, in addition to the zz2 projected bulk modes of type 0b theory the closed string
sector has extra massless modes propagating along the xed fourplane. we will identify

these modes with those of a massless vector eld.

3.2. zz4 orbifold of type iib in the nsr formalism

in the neveu-schwarz-ramond formalism we have only two twisted sectors, as the
space-time part of the orbifold group is only zz2, not zz4. nevertheless, we have eectively
the same number of the sectors due to the two dierent possibilities of the gso projection:

i.e.

(1)f = (1) f = 1 and (1)f = (1) f = 1.
it is quite clear that the gs sectors 1 and 1 correspond to the untwisted sector of
nsr formalism. the gs sector 1 corresponds to nsr states with (1)f = (1) f = 1,
(n s+, n s+) and (r+, r+), while the gs sector 1 corresponds to nsr states
with (1)f = (1) f = 1, i.e. (n s, n s) and (r, r). similarly, the gs sectors
i and i correspond to the 1 twisted sector of nsr with (1)f = (1) f = 1 and
(1)f = (1) f = 1 respectively. let us see how this works in some detail.

untwisted sector: in the ns sector we have the following boundary conditions:

x ( + 2) = x (), x m ( + 2) = x m ()
( + 2) = (), m ( + 2) = m ()

(3.11)

5

the ground state has l0 = l0 =  1
in the gs 1 sector (3.9). the massless level is generated by

2 , which gives the tachyon t . this is the state present

i


1

2|0il  j



1

2 |0ir

(3.12)

which is in 8v  8v of so(8) and then the projection leaves only the purely transverse or
purely longitudinal modes. these are the states we found in the gs untwisted sector (3.5).
in the r sector both the bosons and the fermions are integer moded, the ground state
is supersymmmetric and we have 8 fermion zero modes both in the left and right sectors.
in the (r+, r+) sector, which corresponds to the gs untwisted sector, we nd states

in the 4  4l 4  4. the same representation is found in the (r, r) sector which
corresponds to the gs 1 sector.
twisted sector: the ns boundary conditions are:

x ( + 2) = x (), x m ( + 2) = x m ()
( + 2) = (), m ( + 2) = +m ()

(3.13)

the ground state has zero-point energy l0 = l0 = 1
4 , just like the rst excited level in the
gs description of the i and i twisted sectors (3.8). the fermions m have zero modes
so this excited level is a tensor product of two spinors of so(6), in agreement with what
we wrote in the gs section: in the (n s+, n s+) sector we nd the 4  4 of su (4), as in
the gs i sector, in the (n s, n s) sector we nd the 4  4 of su (4), as in the gs i
sector (3.8).
now, the r boundary conditions are:

x ( + 2) = x (), x m ( + 2) = x m ()
( + 2) = +(), m ( + 2) = m ()

(3.14)

the zero point energy vanishes and  have zero modes so that both for the left and
right movers we nd spinors in 3 + 1 dimensions. in the (r+, r+) sector the ground state
transforms as a product of two positive chirality weyl spinors: it is a photon of positive
helicity (this is the state that corresponds to the ground state of the gs i sector). in the
(r, r) sector the ground state transforms as a product of two negative chirality weyl
spinors: it is a photon of negative helicity corresponding to the ground state of the gs i
sector.

the above construction of the nsr spectrum is identical to what would be done to
describe the zz2 orbifold of type 0b theory by reection of 6 of the coordinates. thus, the
zz4 orbifold of type iib may indeed be thought of as a zz2 orbifold of type 0b. the bulk

6

states of this theory are simply the bulk states of type 0b invariant under the reection of
6 of the coordinates. in addition, we nd a 3 + 1 dimensional massless vector eld which
lives on the xed plane ir3,1. this eect is somewhat analogous to what happens in the
iib string on ale singularity where we nd a tensor theory on the xed plane ir5,1.

are there any objects charged with respect to this vector eld? in the conventional
string theory the quanta of the u (1) eld are created by the vertex operator v of dimension
introduce the
(1, 1).
algebra of the ashkin-teller twist operators which create the square root cuts for the
coordinates x i [16,17]:

it can be written in the canonical superghost picture as follows.

then the operator v is

v = 1

2 f (k) () v(1/2)

v(1/2)

(3.15)

(3.16)

where the chiral operator v(1/2) of dimension 1 is given by:

v(1/2)(z) = e(z)/2(z)

ym =4

m (z)eikx (z)

(3.17)

with  being the bosonized superghost and  the product of twist operators for the
fermions  (i.e.  is a spinor with respect to the unbroken part so(1, 3) of the lorentz
group). the fact that the sum of the dimensions of all the twist eld including that of
superghosts is precisely one is a consistency check of the computation (3.7).

we see that it is the eld strength, not the gauge eld itself, which enters the vertex
operator (3.16). this is hardly a surprize given the r-r origin of the u (1) vector eld.
therefore we expect that the only way the u (1) eld may couple to massless open string
states on d-branes is through some kind of a magnetic moment interaction. on the other
hand, it is well-known that the d-branes couple to the r-r elds as the elementary charges
do.2 can we nd the charged states using d-branes?

first of all, near the xed plane in the presence of the large number of the d3-branes
the geometry looks like ads5  irip5. since the u (1) eld comes from the (r, r) sector,
the natural candidates for the charged particles are the d-branes wrapped over various
cycles of irip5. we might wrap d1, d3 and d5-branes. but in this way we get at most
zz2 charges, for hi(irip5, zz) = zz2 for i = 1, 3, 5 and vanishes otherwise.

2 the point is [18] that in computing the one-point disc amplitude the r-r vertex operator
must be written in the (2) ghost picture while (3.16) has only (1) unit of the total ghost charge.
upon acting on the operator analogous to (3.16) by the inverse of the picture changing operator
eg0 one maps the eld strength into the gauge potential.

4. open string theory

consider the setup of the previous section and add n d3-branes parallel to the xed

fourplane.

4.1. gauge theory on the branes in more detail

it is a standard by now excersize using the techniques of [4] to work out the eld

content of the low-energy eective eld theory on the stack of d3-branes. following [6]
we get the elds of the four dimensional u (4n ) n = 4 gauge theory subject to a certain
invariance condition:

h  ig|jg 

= igh1|jg h1

(4.1)

where  denotes any eld of the u (4n ) theory, h, g, g  zz4, the pair ig, i = 1, . . . , n is
a way to enumerate all 4n color indices of the u (4n ) theory, nally h  denotes the eld
 transformed by an element h of the r-symmetry group su (4). in particular, the gauge
gluons a are singlets under h = ik, k = 0, 1, 2, 3: h  a = a, the fermions transform as:
h  m
 , the scalars transform as: h  mn = i2kmn. the solution of the equations
(4.1) yields the following theory: the gauge group is g = 3
i=0u (ni), ni = n , the global
symmetry group is h = su (4), the fermions transform in (ni+1, ni)  4 of g  h, the
scalars are in (ni+2, ni)  6, i  i + 4.

 = ikm

the scalars have a tree level potential v (). let m
m  6 of h. the scalars obey a reality condition: m,
form:

(4.2)

in addition, there are yukawa couplings. let m

(4.3)

we shall now identify these elds with the specic sectors in the open string theory

keeping in mind further discussion of the interactions of the bulk modes with the modes

propagating on the branes.

8

4.2. vertex operators in the nsr formalism

we work in the nsr formalism and start with d3-branes placed near, but not exactly
at the xed plane. the plane at ir1,3  ir6/zz2 parallel to ir1,3 lifts to two planes on
the covering space, one at x m = xm , another at x m = xm . in addition we may have
electric and magnetic types of branes. if we start with the conguration of the n self-dual
branes, then they lift to the 4n branes on the covering space, n electric and n magnetic
branes at x m = xm and n electric and n magnetic branes at x m = xm . hence we get
four types of the endpoints for the open strings: (xm ), e or m. from now on we assume
that xm = 0.

let i, j = 1, . . . , n denote the chan-paton indices. the total of 4n labels are or-
ganized in pairs (ig), i = 1, . . . , n , g = 1, i,1, i. in type iib string theory the states
corresponding to the vector bosons w ig|jg 
propagating with the (matrix) polarization
vector aig|jg 
(k) and the momentum k along the 4n coinciding d-branes are created by
the boundary vertex operators which can be written in both (1) and 0 pictures:



v1(a, k) = e (a  ) eikx
v0(a, k) = (a  x + i(k  )(a  )) eikx

(4.4)

(4.5)

(recall that as are matrices!) one can also write down the formulae for the scalar modes.
using the doubling trick (see e.g.
[19]) one gets the same formulae as (4.4) except that
now the polarization matrix (denoted by ) points in the m -direction. finally, we need
the formulae for the vertex operators describing the emission of the spinor states with the
wavefunction m

ig|jg :

v1(, k) = e/2 (mm) eikx

v0(, k)ig|jg  = e/2nm

i,nm(cid:0)x i + i(k  )i(cid:1) eikx

what remains is to impose the zz4 invariance conditions. it amounts to demanding:

a,ig|jg  =

m,ig|jg  =

m,ig|jg  =

(4.6)

ij
m,i,i+2g,g gi

where the subscripts i, i + 2 etc. indicate the labels of the gauge factors under which the
chan-paton factors i, j respectively transform.

we see that in considering the coupling of the twisted sector bulk mode to the open
string states propagating on the brane we dont need to alter the ( 1
2 ) picture of the
vertex operator (3.16). hence the only coupling we might see would be of the magnetic
moment type, i.e. with the eld strength of the u (1) eld on the xed plane.

4.3. going away from the singularity

let us look at the (classical) vacua of our theory. the minima of the potential (4.2)

are the solutions to the equations:

m
i n

i+2 = n

i m
i+2

(4.7)

by separating the electric stack from the magnetic stack we make all the bifundamental
elds massive. this separation corresponds to the solution of (4.7) of the form:

0  m
m n

0 n,

0 = xm xn 1, m n

1  m

1 n,

1 = ym yn 1

1 = n

2 and n

where xm  xm 6= 0, ym  ym 6= 0 are the coordinates of the separated stacks.3 this
vev breaks the gauge group down to the u (n )  u (n ) subgroup, where u (n )s are the
diagonal subgroups in the u (n0)  u (n2) and u (n1)  u (n3) respectively. the elds
m
0 = m
3 act as the six massless adjoint scalars of the rst and second u (n )
respectively. thus, as expected, the zz4 theory higgses down to the theory on the electric
and magnetic branes of type 0b theory at a smooth point (away from the singularity).
indeed, in [8] a stack of electric d3-branes was considered and it was shown that its world
volume is described by su (n ) gauge theory coupled to 6 adjoint scalars. the same theory
describes a magnetic stack.

5. discussion

in this paper we have considered an orbifold of type iib string theory by reection of
six of the coordinates. because of the action on the fermions this is actually a zz4 orbifold
of type iib which can equivalently be thought of as a zz2 orbifold of type 0b string theory.
consideration of the closed strings in the twisted sector led us to conclude that the only
massless eld on the xed fourplane ir3,1 is a photon. thus, we have found a simple way
of embedding a u (1) gauge theory into string theory. in view of the recent progress on
connections between large n gauge theories and strings, it is even more interesting to nd
an embedding of pure glue su (n ) gauge theory into a string theory which might help in
searching for its stringy dual.

3 a more general conguration is to also separate the branes within each stack so that the
bifundamental elds get unequal masses and the gauge group is broken down to the maximal
cartan subgroup. this conguration corresponds to the diagonal matrices mn
0,1 with unequal
entries. for such a conguration we do not nd a non-abelian theory in the infrared. it is a subtle

question whether the dynamics favors complete separation of the branes [20].

we have also initiated a study of interactions between the photons on the xed four-
plane with the gauge theories on the d3-branes. we have not been able to identify objects
charged with respect to this u (1) (the fermions on d3-branes have only a magnetic mo-
ment coupling). overall, this orbifold is quite dierent from the n = 2 zz2 orbifold studied
in [4]. in that case the scalars on the xed sixplane could be used to blow up the ir4/zz2
into a smooth ale space. for ir6/zz2 we nd no scalars in the twisted sector, hence it is
not clear how to resolve the singularity.

the original motivation for our work was to nd a d-brane realization of the orbifold of
n = 4 sym by the zz4 center of its su (4) r-symmetry. we have found such a realization
in terms of d3-branes of type 0b string theory orbifolded by reection of six coordinates.
in general, it is quite clear that if the orbifold group  is a subgroup of so(6) then the
gauge theory may be realized on d3-branes of type iib theory, but if  also includes the
center of su (4) then the realization involves the d3-branes of type 0b theory.

appendix a. another zz4 orbifold of type iib string

it may be interesting to consider orbifolding by reection of two of the coordinates:

x m  x m , m = 8, 9 .

(a.1)

this case is similar to the reection of 6 coordinates in that it is a zz4 operation on type
iib string theory. similarly, it can be thought of as a zz2 orbifold of type 0b theory. this
theory has an so(2) internal symmetry group and so(6) transverse group: so compared
to the orbifold (2.1) the two are interchanged.

the discussion of the spectrum proceeds analogously to the case (2.1). the nsr
untwisted sector gives states of type 0b theory invariant under (a.1). something inter-
esting happens in the twisted sector which is localized on the xed eightplane ir7,1. the
(n s, n s) zero-point energy is

el = er = 1/4 ,

so it seems that there is a tachyon living on the xed plane. however, the ground state
transforms as a vector am under the so(2) rotation, hence it is projected out!

thus, the only massless twisted sector states come from the rr sector. from the
(r+, r+) sector we nd 4  4 of su (4), which gives a 1-form and a selfdual 3-form of
so(6). from the (r, r) sector we nd 4  4 of su (4), which gives a 1-form and an
anti-selfdual 3-form of so(6). putting them together we thus nd the gauge potentials,
a, b and a which correspond to two 2-form eld strengths and one 4-form eld

strength. dualizing one of the 2-forms we have f2, f4 and f6. these naturally couple to
a 0-brane, a 2-brane and a 4-brane in 8 dimensions. it seems plausible that these objects
come from 1-branes, 3-branes and 5-branes wrapped over the irip1  s1 which is the base
of the cone. this 8-dimensional theory deserves further study.
