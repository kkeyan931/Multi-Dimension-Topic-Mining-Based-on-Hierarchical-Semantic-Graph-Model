abstract

we propose a new mechanism of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. the existence of
extra dimensions with nontrivial topology plays an important role. we investigate new
features resulted from the mechanism in two simple supersymmetric z2 and u(1) models.
one of remarkable features is that there exists a phase in which the translational invariance
for the compactied directions is broken spontaneously, accompanying the breakdown of
the supersymmetry. the mass spectrum of the models appeared in reduced dimensions
is a full of variety, reecting the highly nontrivial vacuum structure of the models. the
nambu-goldstone bosons (fermions) associated with breakdown of symmetries are found
in the mass spectrum. our mechanism also yields quite dierent vacuum structures if
models have dierent global symmetries.

1 introduction

it has been considered that the (super)string theories [1] (and/or more fundamental theory
such as m-theory) are plausible candidates to govern physics at the planck scale.
in
general these theories are dened in higher space-time dimensions than 4 because of the
consistency of the theories.

in the region of enough low energies, however, we have already known that our space-
time is 4-dimensions, so that extra dimensions must be compactied by a certain mech-
anism [2], and the supersymmetry (susy), which is usually possessed by those theories,
has to be broken because it is not observed in the low energy region. at this stage,
mechanisms of compactications and susy breaking are not fully understood.

it may be interesting to consider quantum eld theory in space-time with one of spaces
being multiply connected. this is because we may shed new light on unanswered questions
in the (supersymmetric) standard model and/or expect some new dynamics which is useful
to seek and understand new physics beyond it. actually, it has been reported that the
avour-blind susy breaking terms can be induced through compactications by taking
account of possible topological eects of multiply connected space [3, 4, 5]. therefore, it
is important to investigate the physics which must be possessed by quantum eld theory
considered in such the space-time.

we shall consider supersymmetric eld theories in space-time with one of the space
coordinates being compactied. one has to specify boundary conditions of elds for the
compactied directions when the compactied space is multiply connected. contrary to
the nite temperature eld theory, we do not know a priori what they should be. we
shall relax the conventional periodic boundary condition to allow nontrivial boundary
conditions on the elds [6, 7]. if the compactied space is topologically nontrivial, the
idea of the nontrivial boundary conditions is naturally realized. due to the topology of
the space, the conguration space also has nontrivial topology. this causes an ambiguity
in quantization of the theory on the space to yield an undetermined parameter in the
theory [8]. the boundary conditions of the elds are twisted with the parameter.

we shall propose a new mechanism of the spontaneous susy breaking through com-
pactication. extra dimensions with nontrivial topology and nontrivial boundary condi-
tions for the extra dimensions play a central role. our mechanism is quite dierent from
the known mechanisms such as the oraifeartaigh [9] and fayet-iliopoulos ones [10]. a
key point of our mechanism is that solutions to f -term conditions exist but they are not
realized as vacuum congurations because of the nontrivial boundary conditions.

as a remarkable consequence of our mechanism, there appears a nontrivial phase
structure with respect to the size of the compactied space. namely, the translational
invariance for the compactied directions is broken spontaneously [11, 12], accompanying
the susy breaking when the size of the compactied space exceeds a certain critical value.
the curious vacuum structures resulted from the mechanism also have an inuence on the
mass spectrum of the theory. depending on the size of the compactied space, we have
a mass spectrum full of variety. the mass spectrum includes nambu-goldstone bosons
(fermions) corresponding to the breakdown of the global symmetries of the theory.

in previous two papers, we presented our idea [15] and applied it to the simple super-
symmetric z2 model [16]. in those papers, however, the details have been omitted and,
in particular, the mass spectrum of the model has been discussed very shortly. since the
mass spectrum has a quite nontrivial dependence on the size of the compactied space, it
is worth investigating it more thoroughly. in this paper, we shall study the mass spectrum

of the z2 model in detail, including general discussions of our new mechanism. we shall
also study a new model called u(1) model in order to see how the mechanism works and
to study new features dierent from those of the z2 model.

in the section 2 we will discuss a key idea of our mechanism and study a general
structure of superpotentials realizing our new mechanism. in the sections 3 and 4 we will
study two minimal models called z2 and u(1) models in detail. the vacuum structures
are determined and the mass spectrum of the models appeared in reduced dimensions are
analyzed. in particular, we pay attention to the nambu-goldstone bosons and fermions
associated with the breakdown of global symmetries, such as the translational invariance
for the compactied direction and the supersymmetry. the section 5 is devoted to conclu-
sions and discussions. we summarize mathematical tools in appendices a and b which
are used in the studies of the sections 3 and 4.

2 general discussion of our mechanism

in this section we shall discuss a basic idea of our susy breaking mechanism, and clarify
how to construct supersymmetric models in which our mechanism works. two minimal
models, called z2 and u(1) models, will be given explicitly.

let w () be a superpotential consisting of the chiral superelds j. the scalar

potential is then given by

v (a) = xj

|fj|2 = xj

w (a)

aj

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

(1)

where aj(fj) denotes the lowest (highest) component of j. the supersymmetry would
be unbroken if there are solutions to the f -term conditions

 f j =

w (a)

aj

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ak= ak

= 0

for all

j,

(2)

since the solutions lead to v ( a) = 0. our idea of the supersymmetry breaking is simple:
we impose nontrivial boundary conditions on the superelds for compactied directions.
they must be consistent with the single-valuedness of the lagrangian but inconsistent
with the f -term conditions (2). then, any solution to the f -term conditions will not
be realized as a vacuum conguration of the model. thus, we expect that v (hai) > 0
because haji 6= aj and that the supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. we should
notice that our mechanism is obviously dierent from the oraifeartaigh one [9] since
solutions to the f -term conditions are allowed to exist in our mechanism.

in order to realize such the mechanism, let us consider the theory in space-time with
one of the space coordinates, say, y being compactied on a circle s1 whose radius is
r. since s1 is multiply connected, we have to specify boundary conditions for the s1
direction. let us impose nontrivial boundary conditions on superelds dened by

j(x, y + 2r) = e2ij j(x, y).

(3)

the phase j should be the one such that the lagrangian density is single-valued, i.e.

l(x, y + 2r) = l(x, y).

(4)

in other words, the phase has to be one of the degrees of freedom of symmetries of the
theory. suppose that aj, which is a solution to the f -term conditions, is a nonzero
constant for some j. it is easy to see that if

e2ij 6= 1,

for some

(5)
then, the vacuum expectation value haji is strictly forbidden to take the nonzero constant
aj because it is inconsistent with the boundary condition (3). in this way, our idea is
realized by the mechanism that the nontrivial boundary conditions imposed on the elds
play a role to force the vacuum expectation values of the elds not to take the solutions
to the f -term conditions. the mechanism clearly does not depend on the space-time
dimensions, so that it would work in any dimensions.

j,

note that the above result does not always lead us to a conclusion that haji = 0,
which is always consistent with (3). certainly, if the translational invariance for the s1
direction is not broken, haji has to vanish because of (3) with (5). if the translational
invariance for the s1 direction is broken, however, vacuum expectation values will no
longer be constants and some of hajis can depend on the coordinate of the compactied
space as an energetically favourable conguration. one should include the contributions
from the kinetic terms of the scalar elds to the scalar potential in order to nd the true
vacuum conguration.

here, it is worth making comments on the nontrivial boundary conditions (3) imposed
on the elds j. the boundary conditions have to be one of the symmetry degrees of
freedom of the theory in order to maintain the single-valuedness of the lagrangian. one
might think that the u(1)r symmetry, which is specic to the supersymmetric theory,
is available.
it is well-known that the boundary condition associated with the u(1)r
symmetry explicitly breaks the supersymmetry [3, 4]. in this paper we do not consider
this case, though it is known to have attractive features [5]. the boundary conditions
(3) we consider in this paper are consistent with the supersymmetry. when space is
multiply connected and hence has nontrivial topology, the conguration space can also
have nontrivial topology. then, it turns out that undetermined parameters like js in
(3) inevitably appear as the ambiguity in quantizing the theory on such the space and
the boundary conditions are twisted according to the parameters [8]. therefore, even
though we state to impose the nontrivial boundary conditions on the elds here, such
the boundary conditions are rm consequences when one studies the theory on multiply
connected space.

now, let us clarify a general structure of superpotentials in which our mechanism
works. let us restrict ourself to 4-dimensions for the illustration. according to the pre-
vious discussions, we see that the scalar potential has to be of the usual higgs-type to
exclude the origin of aj = 0 as a supersymmetric vacuum. so, we require the superpo-
tential to satisfy

for some

j.

(6)

w (a)

aj

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ak=0 6= 0
w (a) = xj

it immediately follows that w (a) should contain linear terms with respect to aj, i.e.

jaj +    ,

(7)

where some of j are nonzero constants. first, let us consider a model consisting of only
one chiral supereld. from (7), the superpotential is of the form

w () =  + f (),

(8)

where f () stands for higher order terms. we can immediately conclude that our mecha-
nism does not work for the superpotential (8) due to the linear term . this is because
the superpotential cannot possess any symmetries which are consistent with the nontrivial
boundary condition of the eld. the phase has to be trivial e2i = 1 in this case in order
to keep the single-valuedness of the lagrangian.

let us next consider a model with two chiral superelds 0 and 1. the superpotential

is written, taking account of the requirement (6), as

w (0, 1) = 00 + 11 + g(0, 1),

(9)

where g(0, 1) stands for higher order interactions. if both 0 and 1 are nonzero, the
superpotential does not again possess any symmetries, so that we cannot impose nontrivial
boundary conditions consistent with the single-valuedness of the lagrangian. therefore,
one of them, say 1, has to be zero, i.e.

w (0, 1) = 00 + g(0, 1).

(10)

in order to maintain the single-valuedness of the lagrangian, 0 has to obey a periodic
boundary condition 0(x, y + 2r) = 0(x, y). thanks to the two chiral superelds,
1 can have a nontrivial boundary condition. we have arrived at a possible form of the
superpotential, written up to cubic interactions, as

w (0, 1) = 00 + m0(0)2 + m1(1)2 + m0101

+ g1(0)3 + g2(0)21 + g30(1)2 + g4(1)3.

(11)

this superpotential can have a z2 or z3 symmetry, depending on how we choose the
parameters (0, m0,    , g4). boundary conditions of the elds have to be consistent with
the symmetry. the superpotential with the z2 symmetry is written as

w (0, 1)z2 = 00 + m0(0)2 + m1(1)2 + g1(0)3 + g30(1)2,

(12)

which is invariant under 0  0 and 1  1. on the other hand, the superpotential
(13)

w (0, 1)z3 = 00 + m0(0)2 + g1(0)3 + g4(1)3.

has the z3 symmetry whose transformation is given by 0  0 and 1  e2i/31.
we shall rst concentrate on the z2 symmetric case and restrict further the form of
the superpotential (12) in order for our mechanism to work. since w (0, 1)z2 has the
z2 symmetry we can impose the nontrivial boundary conditions on 1 dened by

0(x, y + 2r) = +0(x, y), 1(x, y + 2r) = 1(x, y).

(14)

the next task we have to do is to restrict the form of the superpotential (12) in such a
way that there exists a nontrivial solution to the f -term conditions

w (a0, a1)z2

aj

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a0= a0,a1= a1

the f -term conditions for the case are

= 0,

with

a1 6= 0.

0 =

0 =

a0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a0= a0,a1= a1

= 0 + 2m0 a0 + 3g1 a0

2 + g3 a1

2,

= 2 a1(m1 + g3 a0).

(15)

(16)

a1 = 0 or m1 + g3 a0 = 0.

it is easy to see that the condition a1 6= 0 requires at least g3 6= 0. then, the second
condition in (16) leads to
(17)
the rst solution a1 = 0, which is actually unwanted, can be excluded by requiring m0 =
g1 = 0 and 0 6= 0. with these choices of the parameters, a1 = 0 is no longer a solution
of (16) and the second solution in (17) is selected. as the result, the solutions of the f -
term conditions are given by ( a0, a1) = ( m1
). the solutions, however, cannot
be realized as vacuum congurations because they are inconsistent with the boundary
conditions (14). thus, we have found the superpotential which satises our criteria (6)
and (15) to realize our mechanism to be of the form

g3

,q 0

g3

w (0, 1)z2 = 00 + m1(1)2 + g30(1)2.

let us note that by shifting 0 by m1/g3, we can also rewrite (18) as

w (0, 1)z2 = 00 + g30(1)2

(18)

(19)

up to constant. this is a minimal model to realize our mechanism. let us note that
the superpotential (19) has another global symmetry u(1)r in addition to the z2 sym-
metry. as we stated earlier, we do not consider any boundary conditions associated with
the u(1)r symmetry degrees of freedom in this paper, concerning about the boundary
conditions.

it is easy to see that the scalar potential followed from the superpotential (18) or
(19) is the usual higgs-type potential. it is essential for our mechanism that the scalar
potential is the higgs-type to have the minimum of the potential away from the origin
and that nonvanishing a1, which is any solution to the f -term conditions, is inconsistent
with the boundary condition of a1.

let us come back to the superpotential (13) with the z3 symmetry.

in this case,
0 decouples with 1 completely.
it is easy to see that the f -term condition for a1
inevitably gives us a1 = 0 for any choice of the parameters in the superpotential, so that
our mechanism does not work in this case.

we can also construct a supersymmetric model with a continuous symmetry. in this
case the minimal model is given by introducing at least three chiral superelds. the
superpotential with a global u(1) symmetry is given by

w (0, 1)u (1) = 00 + g0+ + m+

with the boundary conditions

0(x, y + 2r) = 0(x, y), (x, y + 2r) = e2i(x, y).

(20)

(21)

the u(1) charges of 0 and  are dened by 0 and 1, respectively. by shifting 0 by
m/g in (20), it is also written as

w (0, 1)u (1) = 00 + g0+

(22)

up to constant. here, this superpotential has the u(1)r symmetry, in addition to the
global u(1) symmetry.

through the discussions we have made, we nally nd the conditions on the super-

potential to be satised in order for our mechanism to work:

 the origin of aj = 0 is not the supersymmetric vacuum of the potential v (a). in

other words, aj = 0 for all j is not a solution to the f -term conditions.

 let aj be a conguration which satises the f -term conditions. some of aj with

aj 6= 0 have to be non-singlets for some global symmetries of the theory.

a key point of our mechanism is that the non-singlet elds aj with aj 6= 0 are required
to obey nontrivial boundary conditions consistent with the single-valuedness of the la-
grangian. it should be emphasized that solutions of the f -term conditions always exist
in our case but are not realized as vacuum congurations due to the nontrivial boundary
conditions. thus, our mechanism is dierent from other ones of the spontaneously susy
breaking, e.g. oraifeartaigh models, in which there are no consistent solutions of the
f -term conditions. in the following two sections, we shall study the z2 and u(1) models
whose superpotentials are given by (18) ( or (19)) and (20) ( or (22)), respectively, in
detail.

3 the z2 model

in this section we study the z2 model obtained in the previous section. in particular, we
study the vacuum structure and the mass spectrum for bosons and fermions of the model.

3.1 vacuum conguration

the superpotential of the z2 model is given by

(23)

we have slightly changed notations of the superpotential (18) in the previous section.
the parameters g and  are complex in general, but their phases can be absorbed into
the redenitions of the elds 0 and 1. thus, we take g and  to be real without
loss of generality. the model at hand is invariant under a discrete z2 transformation
0  0, 1  1. as discussed in the previous section, the existence of the global
symmetry is crucial for our mechanism because otherwise nontrivial boundary conditions
cannot be imposed on the elds. the scalar potential is given by

v (a0, a1)  |f0|2 + |f1|2 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

+ |ga0  |2|a1|2.

it is easy to solve the f -term conditions, and the solutions are given by

a0 = /g,

2/g,

a1 = 

(24)

(25)

at which v ( a0, a1) vanishes. therefore, one might think that the supersymmetry is
unbroken while the z2 symmetry is broken spontaneously. this is, however, a hasty
conclusion, as we will see below.

let us consider the model on m 3  s1. we shall denote the coordinates of m 3 and
s1 by x( = 0, 1, 2) and y, respectively. since s1 is multiply connected, we can impose
the nontrivial boundary conditions on the superelds

0(x, y + 2r) = +0(x, y), 1(x, y + 2r) = 1(x, y).

(26)

it follows that the vacuum expectation value of a1 (and also the auxiliary eld f1) is
forced not to take a nonzero constant, i.e. ha1(x, y)i 6= nonzero constant. therefore, the
solutions (25) to the f -term conditions are not consistent with the boundary conditions
(26) and hence are not realized as vacuum congurations. since any supersymmetric
vacuum has to satisfy the f -term conditions, if any, and since all the solution to the
f -term conditions are excluded from vacuum congurations by the boundary conditions,
the supersymmetry is force to be broken spontaneously, so that our mechanism does work
in this model.

a conguration consistent with the boundary conditions (26) is ha0i = /g,ha1i =
0. one may wonder whether this is a vacuum conguration or not. the conguration
seems unstable because the scalar potential, which is now the higgs-type, has a negative
curvature along the a1 direction at ha0i = /g. when we search vacuum congurations,
we usually minimize the scalar potential. this will not, however, lead to the true vacuum
conguration in the model we are considering. since one of the space coordinates is
compactied on s1, the original elds may be decomposed into kaluza-klein modes for
the s1 direction. the kinetic term for the s1 direction can be regarded as mass terms for
the kaluza-klein modes from the 3-dimensional point of view. an important observation
is that all the kaluza-klein modes for the eld a1 acquire nonvanishing masses since a1(y)
obeys the antiperiodic boundary condition and has no zero mode. this suggests that the
kinetic term of a1 for the s1 direction could drastically change the shape of the potential
(in the 3-dimensional point of view) near the origin a1 = 0 (recall that v (a0, a1) is the
higgs-type). therefore, we should study the scalar potential in which the contribution
from the kinetic terms for the s1 direction is taken into account in order to nd the true
vacuum conguration.

according to the above discussions, the vacuum conguration will be obtained by

solving a minimization problem of the energy functional

e[a0, a1; r]  z 2r

(27)

(28)

we assume that the translational invariance for the 3-dimensional minkowski space-time
is not broken, so that we ignore the x-dependence of a0 and a1.

the detailed discussions on the minimization of the energy functional (27) are made
in the appendix a. let us present the results here. we obtain the vacuum conguration
as

for r  r 

for r > r 

1

2 ( ha0(x, y)i = arbitrary complex constant,
ha1(x, y)i = 0,
2 ( ha0(x, y)i = /g,
ha1(x, y)i = 2k

g sn((y  y0), k).

(29)

(30)

here, the parameter k (0  k < 1) and y0 are the integration constants and   1+k2 .
the sn(u, k) is the jacobi elliptic function whose period is 4k(k), where k(k) denotes the
complete elliptic function of the rst kind. since the integration constant y0, which reects
the translational invariance of the equation of motion, is irrelevant, so that hereafter we
set y0 = 0.

we observe a remarkable feature that in our model there are two phases, depending
on the magnitude of the radius of s1. we see that the vacuum structure of the model
drastically changes at the critical radius r. for r  r, the translational invariance for
the s1 direction and the z2 symmetry are unbroken, while for r > r, since ha1(x, y)i
depends on the coordinate y of the extra dimension, the translational invariance for the s1
direction is broken spontaneously with the breakdown of the z2 symmetry. the vacuum
energy is nonzero for both r  r and r > r, so that the susy is broken spontaneously
for both regions.
as discussed in the appendix a, the parameter k (0  k < 1) is determined through

the condition

2r =

1 + k2k(k)

2


(31)

in order for (30) to satisfy the boundary conditions (28). knowing that k(k) is a mono-
tonically increasing function of k, we immediately obtain the critical radius r  1/2,
which corresponds to k = 0. though we present the detailed discussion on the critical
radius in the appendix a, it may be instructive to show how the critical radius r appears
in the 3-dimensional point of view. to this end, we may expand a0(x, y) and a1(x, y)
in the fourier modes for the y direction, according to the boundary conditions (28). as
found in the next subsection (see also the table iii-1), the squared mass eigenvalues for
r )2 and those for a1 by | gha0i|2  2 + ( n+ 1
the fourier modes of a0 are given by ( n
r )2
with n being integers. it follows that that for r  1
2 all the squared masses are positive
semi-denite and hence the vacuum conguration (29) is stable at least locally, while for
r > 1
g . this implies that the
conguration ha1i = 0 is unstable and can no longer be a vacuum for r > 1
2 . the phase
transition should occur at r = r = 1
2 . as proved in the appendix a, the vacuum
conguration becomes stable by having the coordinate dependence such as (30).

2 negative squared masses would appear with ha0i =

3.2 mass spectrum for r  r

once the vacuum congurations are determined, we shall next analyze the mass spectrum
of the model. we shall employ the standard prescription based on perturbation theory
to obtain the mass spectrum. we expand elds around the vacuum conguration and
take the quadratic terms with respect to the uctuations. the uctuating elds have
to be expanded appropriately in modes of oscillations about the vacuum conguration.
since we are interested in the mass spectrum appeared in the 3-dimensional minkowski
space-time, we integrate over the coordinate y of the extra dimension. in this way we can
obtain the mass spectrum for the bosons and fermions in the model.

let us rst compute the bosonic mass spectrum. the vacuum conguration is given
by (29) for r  r. the bosonic mass spectrum can be read from the quadratic terms of
the scalar potential, including the kinetic terms of the scalar elds for the s1 direction.
it is given by

moreover, in order to obtain the mass spectrum appeared in 3-dimensions, we expand a0,

(28), as

note that the fourier modes of the elds a1(x) and b1(x) cannot have zero modes due to
the boundary condition (28). inserting these expressions into (32) and integrating over
the coordinate y, we obtain the mass spectrum of the bosons. the result is summarized
in the table iii-1.

the computations of the fermion mass spectrum can be done just as in the bosonic
case. the mass spectrum for the fermions can be read from the quadratic terms given by

we are interested in the spectrum appeared in 3-dimensions. we nd that it is convenient
to introduce the dirac spinors in 3-dimensions according to our prescription (160) in the
appendix b and to decompose further the dirac spinors into the majorana spinors (161)
in 3-dimensions. in the appendix b, we present details of the decomposition of the 4-
dimensional spinors and gamma matrices into the 3-dimensional ones. according to these,
we obtain

3.3 analysis of the mass spectrum for r  r

0 + ib(0)

0  a(0)

let us make several comments on the boson and fermion mass spectra obtained in the
previous subsection. it is easy to see from the table iii-1 that the boson mass spectrum
is positive semi-denite for r  r. the vacuum conguration we nd is stable for
r  r. the second comment is that the susy breaking scale is found, from the mass
splitting, to be of order . this is also understood from the fact that the vacuum energy
density for the vacuum conguration (29) is of order . the next comment is that we
observe that the modes a(0)
0 are massless. its physical interpretation is that
the massless modes correspond to the existence of a at direction of the scalar potential
along the a0 direction at the tree level. this interpretation is modied slightly if we start
form the superpotential (19), instead of (18), which has an extra u(1)r symmetry. the
vacuum conguration (29) breaks the u(1)r symmetry spontaneously because a0 carries
the u(1)r charge. we expect a nambu-goldstone boson associated with the breakdown
of the u(1)r symmetry to appear. a part of a(0)
0 will correspond to this massless mode
and the other part of a(0)
is also guaranteed to be massless by the atness of the potential
0
at the tree level. the last comment is that at ha0i = /g, which yields m = 0, we nd
that the squared masses of some of the bosonic modes ac(l)
become negative for
r > r = 1
2 . this suggests that the vacuum conguration becomes unstable for r > r
and that a phase transition occurs at r = r, as discussed in the previous subsection.

and as(l)

let us next make comments on the fermion mass spectrum. we can interpret (0)

0 
(0)
0 + i(0)
as the nambu-goldstone fermions associated with the spontaneous susy
breaking. in order to conrm this interpretation, let us consider the innitesimal susy
transformations

0

sa0(x, y) = 20(x, y),

s0(x, y) = i2(m )m a0(x, y) 
s1(x, y) = i2(m )m a1(x, y) 

sa1(x, y) = 21(x, y),
2  2
(a1(x, y))2! ,
g

g

(48)

(49)

nonvanishing vacuum expectation values of s0(x, y) and s1(x, y) are a signal of the
susy breaking. they become

hs0(x, y)i = 

2

2
g

,

hs1(x, y)i = 0

(50)

for the vacuum conguration (29). since h0(x, y)i 6= 0 for any nonvanishing , the super-
symmetry is completely broken spontaneously. no supersymmetry is left in 3-dimensions.
moreover, it follows from (50) that the nambu-goldstone modes associated with the
supersymmetry breaking should be constant modes of 0 in fourier series for the s1
direction, i.e. they are (0)

0 . hence, we conrm the interpretation.

where n  z > 0 and l  z + 1
2 > 0. these relations mean that the sum of the squared
masses of the bosons for each mode are exactly equal to that of the fermions. this is
known as the supertrace formula which is an immediate consequence of the spontaneous
susy breaking [19], but the relations (51) are a stronger version of it. the formula given
in ref.
[19] implies the equivalence between the sum of the squared masses of all the
bosonic states and that of all the fermionic states (in the 3-dimensional point of view),
while the relations (51) hold for each mode of the bosonic and fermionic states. before
closing this subsection, we shall summarize the mass spectra of the bosons and fermions
for r  r in the figure 1.
3.4 mass spectrum for r > r
in this subsection, we shall compute the mass spectrum for r > r. as we have already
mentioned, the vacuum conguration is given by (30) for r > r. the vacuum cong-
uration is highly nontrivial in the sense that it is given by the jacobi elliptic function
which depends on the coordinate y of the extra dimension and the parameter k. it means
that the vacuum conguration has the r-dependence through the condition (31). this
also reects the mass spectrum, so that it is interesting to study the r-dependence of the
mass spectrum for r > r.

in

3-dimensions. therefore, nding the masses of a(i)
is equivalent to solving the eigenvalue

the eigenvalue equations for a1 and b1 as follows:

h

(61)

with the boundary conditions (i)(u + 2k(k)) = (i)(u). this equation is known as the
lame equation. the boson mass spectrum and its behavior with respect to the radius
r are well understood by known properties of the lame equation, though the exact
eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions are known only for some special cases. we
summarize important properties of the eigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions of
the lame equation in the appendix b.

before discussing the general case of 0  k < 1, it may be instructive to study the

limit of k  0 (r  r = 1/2). in this limit, the lame equation becomes

d2
du2 (u, k = 0) = (k = 0)(u, k = 0).



(62)

the boundary conditions we imposed are reduced to (u+) = (u) because of 2k(0) =
. it is easy to solve the equation. the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions at k = 0 are
simply given as in the table iii-3. we can expand the elds a0, b0, a1 and b1 in terms of
those eigenfunctions as (165) shown in the appendix b.

now, let us come back to the original lame equation with 0  k < 1. the solutions
of the lame equation with the boundary conditions (u + 2k(k)) = (u) are known to
be classied by the four types of the eigenfunctions

ec2n

n (u, k), es2n+2

n

(u, k), ec2n+1

n

(u, k), es2n+1

n

(u, k)

(63)

with n = 0, 1, 2,  . the rst two eigenfunctions in (63) are periodic under u  u+2k(k)
and the last two ones are antiperiodic. the rst and the third eigenfunctions in (63) are
even under u  u and the second and the fourth ones are odd. we denote the eigenvalues
associated with ecn
n (k), respectively. for a positive integer n,
it has been known that the lowest 2n + 1 eigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions
are exactly known as lame polynomials, which are written in terms of the jacobi elliptic
functions, sn(u, k), cn(u, k) and dn(u, k). for general n, solutions of the lame equation
and even for integer n other than 2n + 1 lame polynomials will not be written in such
the simple forms.

let us study the mass spectrum for the bosons with the help of the known analytic
properties of the lame equation. the lame equation for the eld a1 corresponds to the

n = 2 case. we may expand a1(x, y), taking the boundary condition into account, as

respectively. two out of 2n + 1 = 5 lame polynomials satisfy the desired antiperiodic
boundary condition. the two eigenfunctions ec1
2(y, k) are given by the
lame polynomials and their eigenvalues are exactly known. those eigenfunctions and
eigenvalues are explicitly given in the table iii-4. the eigenvalues 2n1
(k)
are degenerate at k = 0, in fact, 2n1
(0) = (2n1)2. they are still degenerate
even for k > 0 except for 1
2(k). by taking account of the mass hierarchies
(164) in the appendix b and the degeneracy among the eigenvalues, the r-dependence
of the mass spectrum for a(c,2n1)
is schematically depicted in the figure 1.
the lame equation for the eld b1 corresponds to the n = 1 case. we may expand

eigenvalues are explicitly given in the table iii-5. the eigenvalues 2n1

although the 2n + 1 lame polynomials for integer n are known exactly, those exact
analytical solutions to the lame equation are rather exceptional. the lame equation for
the elds a0 and b0 corresponds to noninteger n, and none of the eigenfunctions and the
eigenvalues are known exactly. even though we do not know the exact solutions for this
case, we can study the qualitative behaviour of the mass spectrum of a0 and b0. we can
expand the elds a0 and b0 as

a0(x, y) =

this is concluded from the eigenvalue equation (58). the dierential operator h 
du2 + 4k2sn2(u, k) is positive denite for k > 0, so that h| h|i > 0 for any nontrivial
 d2
eigenfunctions. therefore, we conclude 0
n0(k) > 0 for k > 0. the eigenvalues
2n
n0 and 2n

their relative magnitude. the r-dependence of the mass eigenvalues of a(c,2n)

since we have studied the boson mass spectrum at the critical radius r = r(k = 0),
it may be instructive to study the behaviour of the mass spectrum for small values of k
in perturbation theory with respect to the parameter k. in the tables iii-6 and 7, the
perturbative mass spectrum for the rst two lowest modes of a0, b0 and for the second
excited modes of a1, b1 are summarized, up to the order of k2.

+(x, y + 4r) = +(x, y),
+(x, y + 4r) = +(x, y),

(x, y) = +(x, y + 2r),
(x, y) = +(x, y + 2r).

(77)

note that these are consistent with the elds equations because of u(y + 2r) = u(y).
once we solve the equations of motion for +, + with the boundary conditions (77), we
automatically have solutions for ,  through the relations (77).
it follows from the
above consideration that the mass spectrum of the fermions is obtained by solving the
eigenvalue equation

d2
dy2 + (u(y))2 +

h

du(y)

dy i(y) = m2

f (y)

(78)

with the boundary condition (y + 4r) = (y). changing the variables y to u  y, we
recast the above equation into

(cid:16) d

d
du

+ 2k sn(u, k)(cid:17)(u) = (

)2(u)

(79)

with (u + 4k(k)) = (u).

let us rst study the behavior of the fermion mass spectrum in the limit of k  0

(or r  r = 1/2). in this limit the above equation is reduced to
)2(u, k = 0)

mf (k = 0)

d2
du2 (u, k = 0) = (





(80)

with (u + 2, k = 0) = (u, k = 0). the eigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions
are easily obtained as in the table iii-8.

the properties of the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the equation (78) is sum-
marized in the appendix b. as discussed there, in terms of the eigenfunctions denoted
by ecn(u, k) and esn+1(u, k) (n = 0, 1, 2   ), we can expand +(x, y) and +(x, y) as

+(x, y) =

+(x, y) =



xn=0h(c,n)(x)ecn(y, k) + (s,n+1)(x)esn+1(y, k)i,
xn=0h (c,n)(x)ecn(y, k) +  (s,n+1)(x)esn+1(y, k)i.



(81)

then, through the relations (77), (x, y) and (x, y) are given by

(x, y) = +(x, y + 2r)

(x, y) = +(x, y + 2r)





=

=

xn=0h(c,n)(x)ecn((y + 2r), k) + (s,n+1)(x)esn+1((y + 2r), k)i,

xn=0h (c,n)(x)ecn((y + 2r), k) +  (s,n+1)(x)esn+1((y + 2r), k)i. (82)

equipped with these, it is easy to obtain the equations of motion for (c,n)(x), (s,n)(x),
 (c,n)(x) and  (s,n)(x) from the eld equations (75) as follows:

h + (m(i,n)

where i = c, s and we have denoted the eigenvalues of ecn(u, k) and esn(u, k) by
(m(c,n)

even though we do not know exact results of the eigenvalue equation (78), we can
extract the behaviour of the fermion mass spectrum with respect to the radius r by
applying general properties of the equation. as proven in the appendix b, we have
the hierarchies among the eigenvalues of the eigenvalue equation. they yield the mass
hierarchies among the masses of the fermions

we do not know the exact eigenvalues of (m(c,n)

according to these, we schematically depict the r-dependence of the fermion mass spec-
trum for (c,n), (s,n),  (c,n) and  (s,n) for r > r in the figure 1.
)2 and (m(s,n)

)2 except for the lowest
eigenvalue. let us recast the eigenvalue equation (79) into the form a(u)a(u)(u) =
( mf
 )2(u), where a(u)   d
du + 2ksn(u, k). it immedi-
ately follows that all eigenvalues are positive semi-denite. in fact, the lowest eigenvalue
is found to be zero provided that the eigenfunction satises a(u)ec0(u, k) = 0 with
ec0(u + 4k(k), k) = ec0(u, k). the solution to the above equation is given, apart from
a normalization constant, by ec0(u, k) = (kcn(u, k)  dn(u, k))2. this is consistent with
the previous result at k = 0. we can see from (81) that the modes (c,0)(x) and  (c,0)(x)
are massless. all the other modes are massive. it is not dicult to see that these mass-
less modes correspond to the nambu-goldstone fermions associated with the spontaneous
susy breaking, as we will discuss in the next subsection.

although we do not know the explicit forms of the eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues
except for the lowest mode, we can obtain the perturbative mass spectrum for higher
modes with respect to k. the results for the rst three excited states are given in the
table iii-9.

3.5 analysis of the mass spectrum for r > r

let us discuss the boson and fermion mass spectra obtained in the previous subsection
3.4. we have found that the lowest mode of a1 is massless. this mode is interpreted as the
nambu-goldstone boson associated with the breakdown of the translational invariance
for the s1 direction. to see this, let us recall the expression (64) for a1(x, y) in terms
of the eigenfunctions of the lame equation with n = 2. the nambu-goldstone mode
has to be the one proportional to yha1(x, y)i in the expansion of a1(x, y) because of the
commutation relation [iaq, a1(x, y)] = aya1(x, y), where q is a generator of the transla-
tion for the s1 direction. noting that ec1
dyha1(x, y)i, we
nd that the coecient of ec1
(x) corresponds to the nambu-goldstone
boson associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the translational invariance for the
s1 direction. originally, the mode dha1i/dy is a local tangent specied by one parameter,

2(y, k) = cn(y, k)dn(y, k)  d

2(y, k), i.e. a(c,1)

1

which is a consequence of the translational invariance of the equation of motion, to the
space given by all the translated solutions ha1(y  a)i, a  r. so, there always exists
such the zero mode on the quantization around the coordinate-dependent background.
it is important to notice that the translational invariance of s1 can be interpreted as
a global u(1) invariance from the 3-dimensional point of view. in this point of view, a
massless bosonic mode in the phase of the spontaneous breakdown of the translational
invariance can be interpreted as an ordinary nambu-goldstone boson associated with
the spontaneous breakdown of the global u(1) symmetry. to see this, let us expand
ai(i = 0, 1) in fourier series, according to the boundary conditions. the commutation
relations between the generator q and the fourier modes may be given by

hq, a(n)
hq, a(l)

0 (x)i =

(85)

i = 0 and h a(l)

1 i = 0. since a(0)

we see that the generator q, which is originally the generator of the translation of s1,
acts as if it generates global u(1) transformations under which the elds a(n)
and a(l)
0
1
carry the u(1) charges n/r and l/r, respectively. for r  r, the vacuum expectation
values for a0 and a1 are an arbitrary constant and zero, respectively, so that h a(0)
0 i =
arbitrary constant, h a(n6=0)
carries no u(1) charge,
the nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of a(0)
0 does not break the u(1) symmetry.
for r > r, the vacuum expectation values are given by (30). since sn(y, k) can be
expanded in fourier series as sn((y  y0), k) = plz+ 1
r ) with cl 6= 0, we
obtain h a(0)
1 has a u(1) charge l/r, so
that the vacuum expectation value h a(l)
1 i breaks the u(1) symmetry spontaneously. this
observation is consistent with the previous discussion that the nambu-goldstone boson
is incorporated in a1(x, y) as yha1(x, y)i.
let us discuss the nambu-goldstone fermions associated with the breakdown of the
supersymmetry. even though we do not obtain the fermion mass spectrum exactly, we
denitely have massless modes associated with the eigenfunction ec0(u, k). the vacuum
expectation values of the susy transformations for the spinors in the vacuum congura-
tion (30) are given by

2r, h a(n6=0)

(86)

where we have used   = (iy) and y = y. since both hs0i and hs1i do not

vanish for any nontrivial , the supersymmetry is completely broken spontaneously and
no susy is left in 3-dimensions. in the appendix b we present the expressions for the
expansion of 0 and 1 in terms of the eigenfunctions ecn and esn (see (169) and (170)).
since ec0 is found to be ec0 = (k cn(u, k)  dn(u, k))2, we can show that
g

0(x, y) =

where    denotes higher modes. comparing (87) with (86) and identifying  in (86)
g22 ((c,0) + i (c,0)), we can conclude that the fermion zero modes (c,0) and  (c,0)
with
are nothing but the nambu-goldstone fermions associated with the spontaneous susy
breaking.

b = tr m2

let us comment on the supertrace formula for the mass spectrum in the z2-model
for r > r. we can immediately see from (54), (57) and (73) that the supertrace
formula tr m2
f formally holds. this relation, however, may mathematically
be meaningless because the trace has to be taken in an innite dimensional space, so that
the sum of the eigenvalues of each squared mass operator would diverge. for r  r,
the relations (51) hold in the subspace of each fourier mode. so, they are meaningful
relations. we do not know whether there are any nite dimensional subspaces in which
the relation still holds for r > r. finally, we summarize the phase structure of the
model in the table iii-10.

4 the u(1) model

in this section we shall study the u(1) model which has a global u(1) symmetry, instead
of the discrete z2-symmetry. we will nd interesting features dierent from those of the
z2 model. we, again, study the vacuum structure and the mass spectrum for bosons and
fermions.

4.1 vacuum conguration

the superpotential of the u(1) model is given by

w (0, ) = g0(cid:18)2

g2  +(cid:19).

(88)

we shall use this superpotential which has no mass term for . we have slightly changed
the notations of the superpotential (22). the model has two global u(1) and u(1)r
symmetries. the u(1) symmetry is dened by 0  +0 and   e2i. this
global symmetry plays an important role for our mechanism to work. the scalar potential
v (a0, a) is given by

v (a0, a) = |f0|2 + |f+|2 + |f|2

= (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

g  ga+a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

+ |ga0|2(cid:18)|a+|2 + |a|2(cid:19).

(89)

the solutions to the f -term conditions are easily found to be a0 = 0 and a+ a = 2
g2 ,
at which the scalar potential vanishes.
let us consider the model on m 3  s1. the notations concerning about the space-time
are the same with the previous section. using the u(1) symmetry degrees of freedom, we
can impose the nontrivial boundary conditions on the superelds 0(x, y) and (x, y)
for the s1 direction

0(x, y + 2r) = +0(x, y), (x, y + 2r) = e2i(x, y).

(90)

it should be emphasized that we do not use the u(1)r symmetry degrees of freedom to
impose nontrivial boundary conditions, as stated earlier. in the following we restrict the
phase  to be the range 0 <   1

2 without loss of generality.

it is easy to see that the f -term conditions are not consistent with the boundary
conditions (90), by which the vacuum expectation values of a are forced not to take
any nonzero constants. therefore, the vacuum conguration given by the solutions of the
f -term conditions are not realized as a supersymmetric vacuum conguration. thus, our
mechanism works again in this model.

as we have done in the previous section, in order to nd the true vacuum conguration,

we have to solve the minimization problem of the energy functional dened by

it follows from the rst equation that the vacuum conguration can be classied into two
types of solutions as

(i); ( a0(y) = arbitrary constant

a(y) = 0

(ii); ( a0(y) = 0

a+(y) 6= 0 and/or a 6= 0.

for the type (i) solution, e[a0, a; r] becomes

e[a0 = const., a = 0; r] =

2r4

g2

.

on the other hand, for the type (ii) solution, we can easily show that

e[a0 = 0, a; r](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e

(94)

(95)

(96)

an important conclusion here is that if there appears any type (ii) solution with a 6= 0,
then, the type (i) solution is no longer a vacuum conguration.
let us next nd the vacuum conguration explicitly. to do this, we redene the elds

a0(y)  a0(y),

a(y)  ei 

r y a(y).

(97)

note that a0(y) and a(y) satisfy the periodic boundary condition. inserting (97) into
(91), we obtain

e[a0, a; r] = eke[ a0; r] + eke[ a+; r] + eke[ a; r] + ep e[ a0, a; r],

our strategy to nd the vacuum conguration is that we rst look for congurations
which minimize each of eke[ a0; r], eke[ a; r] and ep e[ a0, a; r] and then construct
congurations which minimize all of them.
let us look for congurations which minimize each of eke[ a0; r] and eke[ a; r].
for that purpose, we expand the elds in fourier series, taking account of the boundary
r y. inserting them into

conditions, as a0(y) = pnz a(n)
0 ei n
eke[ a0; r] and eke[ a; r], we obtain

found to be

where a(0)
 and a0(1) are arbitrary complex constants. let us next look for con-
gurations which minimize ep e[ a0, a; r]. as we saw before, we have the two types
of the solutions, i.e. type (i) and (ii). for the case (i), ep e[ a0, a; r] becomes (95).
to nd the type (ii) solution we rewrite a into the form a+(y) = +(y)ei(y) and
a(y) = (y)ei(y)+i(y), where (y) are real and positive semi-denite functions of y
and (y), (y) are real functions of y. inserting them into ep e, we obtain

ep e[ a0 = 0, a; r]  ep e[, , ; r]

since + and  are positive semi-denite and since + 6= 0 for the congurations
which minimize ep e[, , ; r],  has to vanish to minimize ep e[, , ; r]. then, we
nd that the conguration minimizing ep e[, ,  = 0; r] with  6= 0 is given by

where v  q2  (/r)2. the arbitrary parameter y0 reects the u(1) symmetry of

the theory and also reects the fact that the equations of motion are invariant under
the translation for the s1 direction. the relation between the two symmetries will be
discussed later. let us note that when  = 1
2 we have another choice of the vacuum
conguration ha(x, y)i = 1
2r (yy0) for r > r. the vacuum in this case is doubly
degenerate. one of them corresponds to the right moving mode on s1 and the other does
to the left moving mode.

g vei 1

as in the z2 model, there are two phases, depending on the magnitude of the radius
of s1. we see that the vacuum structure drastically changes at the critical radius r. for
r < r, the u(1)r symmetry is broken, while for r > r, the translational invariance for
the s1 direction is broken spontaneously with the breakdown of the u(1) symmetry [22].
the vacuum energy is nonzero for both r  r and r > r, so that the supersymmetry
is broken spontaneously for both regions.

4.2 mass spectrum for r  r

since we have obtained the vacuum conguration, let us next study the mass spectrum
appeared in 3-dimensions. the mass spectrum will be obtained by the same prescription
used in the previous section. let us start to compute the boson mass spectrum, which
can be read from the quadratic part of the 3-dimensional lagrangian

(107)

where the eld a0 has been shifted by the vacuum expectation value ha0i. let us expand
the elds a0(x, y) and a1(x, y) in fourier series for the s1 direction

a0(x, y) =

4.3 analysis of the mass spectrum for r  r

let us study here the masses of the bosons and fermions obtained in the previous sub-
section. note that all the squared masses (110) and (117) are positive semi-denite for
it is easy to see
r  /. the vacuum conguration (105) is stable for this region.
from the boson mass splitting that the scale of the susy breaking is of order . we

observe that the mode a(0)
is massless. the physical interpretation for this massless mode
0
is that a part of it is guaranteed by the atness of the scalar potential at the tree-level
and another part of it corresponds to the nambu-goldstone boson associated with the
breakdown of the u(1)r symmetry due to the vacuum conguration (105).

we also observe that in the mass spectrum there appears a massless fermion mode
(0)
0 which is the dirac spinor in 3-dimensions. this corresponds to the nambu-goldstone
fermion associated with the spontaneous susy breaking. in order to conrm this, let us
recall the innitesimal susy transformations for the spinor elds

s0 = i2(m )m a0 
s = i2(m )m a + 2ga0a

2(

2
g  ga+a




),

.

(118)

in the vacuum background given by (105), the vacuum expectation values of s0 and
s become

hs0i = 

2

2
g

,

hsi = 0.

(119)

it
thus, for any nontrivial , the supersymmetry is completely broken spontaneously.
follows from (119) that the mode of the nambu-goldstone fermion associated with the
susy breaking is the one proportional to hs0i in 0(x, y), that is, a constant mode with
respect to y in fourier series. therefore, we conrm that (0)
is the nambu-goldstone
0
fermion associated with the breakdown of the supersymmetry.

let us note that the mass spectrum of the bosons and fermions satises the following

mass relations for each mode n:

(120)

(121)

these are the supertrace formulas for the squared masses in 3-dimensions, though the
original proof of the supertrace formula in ref.[19] does not necessarily imply the equiva-
lence between the sum of the boson squared masses and that of the fermion ones for each
fourier mode.

4.4 mass spectrum for r > r

in this subsection, we shall study the mass spectrum for the bosons and fermions for
r > /. we expand the elds around the vacuum conguration (106) and take the
quadratic part of the lagrangian to obtain the mass spectrum. the relevant terms for
the boson mass spectrum are given by

we shall not here try to solve the eigenvalue equation for the fermion masses exactly,
though the mass eigenvalues could be obtained by solving a cubic equation. however,
some of important properties, which will be discussed in the next subsection, can easily
be extracted from the expression (132). the schematic behavior of the boson and fermion
masses with respect to r is found in the figure 2.

4.5 analysis of the mass spectrum for r > r

it is easy to see from (125) that the squared masses for the bosons are all positive semi-
denite for r > / with 0 <   1
2. since the vacuum conguration (106) breaks both
the translational invariance for the s1 direction and the global u(1) symmetry, one might
expect two massless nambu-goldstone modes associated with the broken generators of
the symmetries. if we take a look at the boson mass spectrum, however, there is only one
massless mode given by

m2 = v2 + (

n
r

)2 rv4 + 4(


r

)2(

n
r

)2 = 0

for n = 0.

(133)

a physical interpretation for this goes as follows: let us consider the u(1) transforma-
tion, which is a linear combination of the translation for the s1 direction and the u(1)
transformation, dened by

u(1) : a0(x, y)  a0(x, y + a), a(x, y)  ei 

r aa(x, y + a).

(134)

it turns out that the u(1) transformation is an exact symmetry of the model. in fact, the
vacuum conguration (106) is invariant under the modied u(1) transformation (134).
therefore, one linear combination of the two symmetry generators survives as an unbroken
generator and the massless boson corresponds to the nambu-goldstone mode associated
with the broken generator.

it is easy to see that there is a massless mode (in the sense of the 3-dimensional
dirac spinor) in the fermion mass spectrum, which can be seen from the fact that the
determinant of the matrix (132) can be zero. the determinant of the mass matrix is
computed as det(m(n)
r )2 + 2v2)2. since v2 > 0 and n2  2 > 0 for

r )2  ( 

f )2 = ( n

r)2(( n

n 6= 0, the determinant of the matrix can be zero only when n = 0. this implies that
there is a massless eigenvalue in the mass matrix. this massless mode corresponds to
the nambu-goldstone fermion associated with the spontaneous susy breaking. to see
this, let us consider the vacuum expectation values of the susy transformations for the
spinors in the vacuum conguration (106), i.e.

hs0i = 

2
g

r(cid:19)2
(cid:18) 

,

hsi =

2
g

i(y )v(cid:18)  i



r(cid:19)ei 

r y.

(135)

since hs0i and hsi do not vanish for any nontrivial choice of  and , the su-
persymmetry is spontaneously broken completely. the corresponding nambu-goldstone
(3-dimensional dirac) fermion is the massless mode found above.

in the z2 model, we have not found any simple relations between the boson and the
fermion masses for r > r. in the u(1) model, we have, however, found that the mass
matrices (124) and (132) lead to the supertrace formula which holds for each fourier mode
between the bosons and the fermions, i.e. tr(m(n)
it is interesting to study the supersymmetry breaking in the r   limit. in this
limit, the supersymmetry transformations for the spinor elds vanish as seen from (135).
therefore, the supersymmetry is restored in this limit, which is very contrary to the
z2 model in which the supersymmetry is broken even in this limit. the net eect of the
boundary conditions of the u(1) model completely disappears and we will have the n = 2
supersymmetry in 3-dimensions in the limit of r  . finally, let us summarize the
phase structure of the u(1) model in the table iv-1.

b )2 = tr(m(n)

f )2.

5 conclusions and discussions

in this paper we have proposed a new mechanism of the spontaneous susy breaking.
we have discussed the general criteria for the superpotential in order for our mechanism
to work. we have obtained the two minimal models, z2 and u(1) models to realize our
mechanism and studied the dynamical aspects, such as the vacuum structure and the
mass spectra in the models.

the crucial point of our mechanism is that there exist the solutions to the f -term
conditions but they are not realized as the vacuum congurations, as contrary to the usual
cases, because of the nontrivial boundary conditions of the elds for the compactied
direction.
it is important to investigate the energy functional including the kinetic
terms of the scalar elds in order to nd the true vacuum conguration consistent with
the nontrivial boundary conditions. a remarkable observation in our analysis is that
the vacuum congurations which depends on the coordinate of the extra dimensions are
energetically favorable than any coordinate-independent congurations for r > r. in
other words, there exists a phase in which the translational invariance of the compactied
direction is spontaneously broken when the size of the extra dimension exceeds the critical
radius, at which the phase transition occurs. on the other hand, the supersymmetry is
broken spontaneously irrespective of the size of the extra dimension in both models.

the complexity of the vacuum structures reects the mass spectra of the models,
which have rich structures and depend on the size of the extra dimension in a nontriv-
ial way. the vacuum conguration breaks some of the symmetries of the models, so
that the nambu-goldstone bosons and/or fermions associated with the breakdown of the
symmetries appear. we have actually observed those massless modes in the mass spectra.

our mechanism can cause quite dierent vacuum structures if the models have dif-
ferent global symmetries whose degrees of freedom are available to impose nontrivial
boundary conditions on the elds. this is easily observed in the two models we have
studied. the vacuum structures of the two models are quite dierent, as seen from (29),
(30), (105) and (106). moreover, the behavior of the models in the limit of r   is
also quite dierent. in the z2 model the vacuum conguration is reduced to a single kink
solution, which is one of the topologically stable solutions

ha1(x, y)i|r=

=

2
g

tanh(cid:18) 
2

y(cid:19).

(136)

the supersymmetry is still broken in this limit because the vacuum expectation values of
the susy transformations for 0 and 1 do not vanish even in this background

hs0i|r = 

2

cosh2( y2)

,

hs1i|r = i2

cosh2( y2)

.

(137)

for any nontrivial , there is no susy transformation which acts trivially on the kink
solution. therefore, the supersymmetry is still broken in the limit of r   to have no
susy in 3-dimensions [20], while in the u(1) model, the supersymmetry is restored in the
limit of r   to have the n = 2 susy in 3-dimensions. this is easily seen from (135).
this is very contrary to the z2 model in which the supersymmetry is still completely
broken in this limit. the eect of the boundary conditions on the elds completely
disappears to be able to have a constant vacuum expectation value of ha1i. these are
direct consequences followed from the fact that in the two models the vacuum structures
have quite dierent dependence on the coordinate of the extra dimension. these results
will not be specic to the models considered in this paper, but are expected to be general
ones of the theories in which our mechanism works.

there will be many ways to extend our work.

let us comment on an eective theory appeared in 3-dimensions.

if one tries to
construct the eective theory in 3-dimensions by only massless modes, we have free eld
theories for the z2 and u(1) models in the region of r  r. on the other hand, in the
region of r > r, we have interacting eld theories with yukawa couplings in the two
models. in the limit of r  , the eective z2 model has no supersymmetry, while the
u(1) model has the 3-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetry.
it may be interesting to ask how
our mechanism works on more complex manifolds, such as torus. we expect that there
will appear complicated phase structures, depending on the size of their compactied
spaces and on how we impose nontrivial boundary conditions on superelds. we can
also study models with nonabelian global symmetries such as su(n), instead of z2 and
u(1) symmetries. in addition to them, it is important to study gauge theories and to see
how our mechanism works and what new dynamics are hidden in them. it may also be
interesting to investigate how the partial susy breaking occurs in the gauge theory in
the connection of the well-known bps objects. these will be reported in the near future.

appendix a

in this appendix, we show how we determine the vacuum conguration in the z2
model in detail. the vacuum conguration ha0i and ha1i have to be stable against any
innitesimal variations of a0 and a1. so, they have to satisfy the eld equations derived
from the energy functional (27)

(139)

it is convenient to separately investigate the two cases: type (i);ha1(y)i = 0 and
type (ii);ha1(y)i 6= 0. let us rst consider the type (i) solution. in this case we nd

the equality holds only when da0
dy = 0 or equivalently a0(y) = arbitrary complex constant.
thus, the type (i) solution is found to be a(i)
0 (y) = arbitrary complex constant and
a(i)
1 (y) = 0. it is obvious that these satisfy the equations of motion (138) and (139). for

obviously, e[, ] is positive semi-denite and the equality e[, ] = 0 holds only
when (y) = 0. therefore, we have found that the type (ii) solution for the vacuum
conguration should be of the form, a(ii)
1 = 12(y). now the minimization
problem of e[a(ii)

general solutions satisfying (148) are known to be given by

(149)

q(1  x2)(1  k2x2)

(151)

the parameters k (0  k < 1) and y0 are integration constants. since we have found
the general solutions to the equation of motion (148) (precisely speaking, we nd the
general solutions for periodic motions), the next task is to extract desired solutions from
the general solutions, which have to satisfy the boundary condition (147).
it leads to
sn((y + 2r  y0), k) = sn((y  y0), k). this relation can be satised provided that
(152)

2r = (2n  1)2k(k)
for some positive integer n.
it should be emphasized that there do not always exist
solutions for any values of r and n. indeed, in order for a solution of (152) to exist, the

2

inequality r  n 1

 has to be satised, where we have used k(k)  k(0) = /2 and
we are, now, in a position to decide which conguration minimizes the energy
functional (141). in the above analysis, we have found that the vacuum conguration
should be given by one of the congurations

where n  z > 0 and k is determined by the condition (152). let us decide which
conguration is the vacuum one.
in the region of 0 < r  1/2, the condition (152) cannot be satised for any n.
so, there exists only the type (i) solution. we immediately conclude that the type (i)
solution is the vacuum conguration in this region. the energy functional is then given
by e[a(i)
. in the region of 1/2 < r  3/2, we have the type (ii) solution
with n = 1 as well as the type (i) solution. as we have already shown in (149), the vacuum
conguration should be given by the type (ii) solution with n = 1. in the same way, for
the region of (n  1/2)/ < r  (n + 1/2)/, we have the type (ii) solutions with
n = 1, 2,   , n as well as the type (i) solution. the energy functional for each solution

b.1 2-component spinors in 3-dimensions from 4-dimensions

let us summarize the relations between 4-dimensional gamma matrices and 3-dimensional

ones. we also present the decompositions of 4-dimensional spinors into 3-dimensional
ones.

let us dene the -matrices in 4-dimensions by

0 = 122 = 0, 1 = z = 1,
2 = x = 2,
3 = y = 3,

(or y = y = y),

(157)

where i(i = x, y, z) is the pauli matrix. then, we dene the -matrices in 3-dimensions
by   y ( = 0, 1, 2). the -matrices in 3-dimensions satisfy {, } = 2 with
diag () = (, +, +), and they have properties such as

(0) = 0,
(1) = 1,
(2) = 2,

(0)t = 0,
(1)t = 1,

(2)t = 2,

(0) = 0,
(1) = 1,
(2) = 2.

(158)

this representation is the majorana representation. the charge conjugation in 3-dimensions
is dened by c  c t , where  = 0 = 0. the c is the charge conjugation ma-
trix dened by c  0 = 0 = y. a majorana fermion in 3-dimensions is dened by
 = c = . according to the denitions we made above, we have the prescription used
in the text. let us denote a 2-component dirac spinor in 3-dimensions and a 2-component
weyl spinor in 4-dimensions by  and (4), respectively. then, we have


(4) = (iy) = (it y),

 
(4) = (iy) = (iy).

(4)(4) = i c,


 
(4) = i c,
(4) 

(4) () (4) = , 

(4) = cc,
(4)() 

(4) (y) (4) =  ,

(4) = cc.

(4)(y) 

(159)

(160)

it is useful that we express further a dirac spinor in terms of two majorana spinors in
3-dimensions. let  and  be two 3-dimensional dirac spinors. they can be expressed
in terms of 3-dimensional majorana spinors such as

 

1
2

(1 + i2),

 

1
2

(1 + i2),

(161)

where 1, 2, 1 and 2 are the majorana spinors in 3-dimensions. the 3-dimensional
majorana spinors used in the text are dened through (161).

b.2 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the lame equation

in this subsection, we briey summarize general properties of the lame equation

d2

du2 + n(n + 1)k2 sn2(u, k)i(i)(u, k) = (i)(k)(i)(u, k).

h

(162)

the solutions to the lame equation with (u+2k(k)) = (u) are known to be classied
by the four types of the eigenfunctions denoted by ec2n
(u, k)

(u, k), es2n+2

n

n (u, k), ec2n+1

n

and es2n+1

n

n (u + 2k(k), k) = ec2n

n (u, k), ec2n

(u, k) with n = 0, 1, 2,   [23]. these satisfy
n (u, k) = ec2n
(u, k) = ec2n+1
(u, k) = es2n+2
(u, k) = es2n+1

(u, k), es2n+2

(u, k), ec2n+1

(u, k), e2n+1

n (u, k),
(u + 2k(k), k) = ec2n+1
(u + 2k(k), k) = es2n+2
(u + 2k(k), k) = es2n+1

let us denote the eigenvalues belonging to ecn
n (k),
respectively. since the integer n corresponds to the number of nodes of the eigenfunctions,
we have the following increasing sequence of the eigenvalues:

n (u, k) and esn

n (u, k) by n

n (k) and n

n < 1

n < 2

n <    ,
n <    ,
n < 4
n < 3

n <    ,
n <    .

(164)

the following results about the degeneracy of the eigenvalue have been known:

n for all n = 0, 1, 2,   if n is not an integer or if n is an integer and

 n

n 6= n
n = 0, 1, 2,   , n.
n = n

n if n and n are integers and n > n.

 n
for a positive integer n, it has been shown that the lowest 2n + 1 eigenvalues and the
associated eigenvalues are exactly known as lame polynomials, which are polynomials in
terms of sn(u, k), cn(u, k) and dn(u, k). for general n, solutions of the lame equation
and even for integer n, other than 2n + 1 lame polynomials will not be written in such
simple forms. we explicitly present the lame polynomials for n = 1 and n = 2 below.
the lame equation with n = 1 has 2n + 1 = 3 lame polynomials which are given, apart
from normalization constants, by

lame polynomial

1 = cn(u, k)

from normalization constants, by

ec2

2 = 2(1 + k2 + 1  k2 + k4)

equipped with the eigenfunctions of the lame equation, we may expand the elds
a0, b0, a1 and b1 in (33) in terms of these eigenfunctions. by taking account of the boundary
conditions the bosonic elds a0 and b0 can be expanded as (68) in the text. the mass
eigenvalue for each mode a(c,2n)
are given by (69) in the text.
in the same way, by taking account of the boundary conditions, the eld a1 and b1 can
be expanded as (64) and (66), respectively. the eigenvalues for the each mode is given
by (65) and (67).

let us consider the limit of k  0 of the lame equation. this limit corresponds to the
limit of r  r = 1/2. in this limit, the lame equation is reduced to  d2
du2 (u, k = 0) =
(k = 0)(u, k = 0). the boundary conditions in this limit become (u + ) = (u).
the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions are easily found, and they are given by

eigenfunction
n (u, k = 0) = 12r

ec0
n (u, k = 0) = 1r
n (u, k = 0) = 1r

n (k = 0) = 0
n (k = 0) = n2 n = 1, 2, 3   
n (k = 0) = n2 n = 1, 2, 3   

then, it follows that the expansions of the elds a0(x, y), b0(x, y), a1(x, y) and b1(x, y) at
k = 0 become

a0(x, y) =

b.3 eigenvalue equation (78)

let us consider the properties of the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of the

equation

d2
dy2 + (u(y))2 +

h

du(y)

dy i(y) = m2

f (y),

(166)

where u(y)  2ksn(y, k) and (y + 4r) = (y). let ecn(u, k) and esn(u, k) be
solutions of the eigenvalue equation with

ecn(u, k) k0 cos(nu), esn(u, k) k0 sin(nu),

(167)

up to normalization constants. since the eigenvalues of ecn(u, k) and esn(u, k) are
found to be degenerate, as we will prove later, it is not sucient to specify ecn(u, k) and
esn(u, k) only by the conditions (167). the eigenfunctions ecn(u, k) and esn(u, k) may
be supplemented by the condition of even/oddness under the transformation u  u:

ecn(u, k) = ecn(u, k),

esn(u, k) =  esn(u, k).

(168)

once we have two properties (167) and (168), the eigenfunctions ecn(u, k) and esn(u, k)
are uniquely specied up to normalization constants.

since the set of {ecn(u, k), esn+1(u, k), n = 0, 1, 2,  } is expected to form a com-
plete set, we can expand  and  in terms of these eigenfunctions as done in the text
(see (81) and (82)). once we obtain the expansions for these spinor elds, the dirac
spinors i (i = 0, 1) in 3-dimensions are expanded as

0(x, y) 

=

1(x, y) 

=

(0(x, y) + i0(x, y))

xn=0h((c,n)(x) + i (c,n)(x))(ecn(y, k) + ecn((y + 2r), k))

(1(x, y) + i1(x, y))

let us discuss the relative magnitude of the eigenvalues m(c,n)

given by
(84) in the text. the rst and second relations in (84) are easy to prove. it is easy to see
that at k = 0 the eigenfunctions ecn(u, k = 0) and esn(u, k = 0) have 2n nodes in the
region 0  u < 4k(0) = 2. this fact implies that the number of modes of ecn(u, k)
and esn(u, k) even for 0  k < 1 is equal to 2n. since the number of nodes for ecn(u, k)
or esn(u, k) is larger than that of ecm(u, k) or esm(u, k) if n > m, we conclude that
m(i,n)
f > m(i,m)
if n 6= 0.
first, let us note that

(i = c, s). let us next prove the third relation m(c,n)

f = m(s,n)

and m(s,n)

f

f

f

f

a(u)a(u)ecn(u, k) = (m(c,n)

f

/)2ecn(u, k),

(171)

where a(u)   d
du + 2k sn(u, k). since sn(u + 2k(k), k) =
sn(u, k), a(u) and a(u) satisfy a(u + 2k(k)) = a(u) and a(u + 2k(k)) = a(u). it
follows that

du + 2k sn(u, k) and a(u)  d

a(u)a(u)ecn(u + 2k(k), k) = (m(c,n)

f

/)2ecn(u + 2k(k), k).

(172)

multiplying the both sides of the above equation by a(u), we nd that a(u)ecn(u +
2k(k), k) belongs to the same eigenvalue (m(c,n)
/)2 as ecn(u, k). we shall now show
that the eigenfunction a(u)ecn(u + 2k(k), k) is indeed proportional to esn(u, k) if
n 6= 0. it is easy to show that

f

a(u)ecn(u + 2k(k), k)

uu a(u)ecn(u + 2k(k), k)
= a(u)ecn(u + 2k(k), k).

(173)

thus, the eigenfunction a(u)ecn(u + 2k(k), k) is odd under u  u. we can further
show that

a(u)ecn(u + 2k(k), k)

ecn(u + , k = 0)

d
du

k0
 sin(nu).

(174)

therefore, the eigenfunction a(u)ecn(u + 2k(k), k) has been found to satisfy the prop-
erties (167) and (168), which esn(u, k) should satisfy, and hence a(u)ecn(u + 2k(k), k)
can be identied with the eigenfunction esn(u, k), up to normalization. it follows that
ecn(u, k) and esn(u, k) belong to the same eigenvalue, i.e. m(c,n)

f = m(s,n)

f

if n 6= 0.
