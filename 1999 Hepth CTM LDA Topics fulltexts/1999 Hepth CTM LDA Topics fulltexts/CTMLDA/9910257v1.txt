abstract

we consider a spontaneously broken abelian gauge theory with a
scalar-fermion coupling non-linear in the higgs eld, which reduces
to a yukawa term in the unitary gauge. we examine in this gauge
the one-loop divergences in a physical process and we nd they are
not all of the renormalizable type. comparison is made with the
linear coupling theory, where cancellation of the non-renormalizable
divergences occurs.

some years ago it was proposed [1] a class of pure left su(n)u(1) gauge
theories with spontaneously broken symmetry, capable of accommodating the
weinberg-salam model as well as some of its generalizationsa up to the higgs
sector. they exhibit the unfamiliar feature of using a non-linear scalar-
fermion coupling in the higgs elds, which, however, reduces to a yukawa
term in the unitary gauge. it is natural to ask whether such a construction

is generally compatible with renormalizabilityb. we show here, by pointing
to a simple abelian model, that non-renormalizability can be induced.

consider the spontaneously broken u(1) theory given by the lagrangian

l = l1 + l2 (2,  > 0)

the gauge eld, with d =   iga.  is dened by writing

where ,  are real. the gauge transformations are

(4)

the - coupling is of the type mentioned above: it is not linear in , while
in the unitary gauge  = 0 it represents a genuine yukawa term, as  remains
the only scalar degree of freedom.

the fermion-scalar term denitely singles out the unitary gauge as the
most preferable one for writing the feynman rules. let mf , m denote the
masses (in the tree approximation) acquired after symmetry breaking by
the fermion and the vectorial eld, respectively, and let /2 represent the
shifted  eld with zero vacuum expectation value. the unitary gauge inter-
action lagrangian reads then

the feynman rules follow from the eective interaction hamiltonian [4]
m(cid:17) , using the covariant massive vector eld
hef f = lint + i4(0) ln(cid:16)1 + g 
propagator (g + kk/m 2)/(k2  m 2 + i).

bwe have in mind the usual sense [2] requesting all divergences to be absorbed in
renormalization constants in the original lagrangian. for a dierent, recent view, see ref.
[3].

now, it is well-known [5] that in unitary gauge renormalizability amounts
to the possibility of calculating physical quantities, while o-shell green
functions are generally non-renormalizable due to the bad ultraviolet be-
havior of the massive vectorial propagators. for s matrix elements, the
underlying gauge symmetry is expected to lead to the cancellation of the
non-renormalizable divergences in individual feynman graphs, when they
are summed up. we show this fails to happen for the above theory.

consider the g4 or one-loop contribution to the fermion-fermion elastic
scattering. some of the contributing feynman graphs are displayed in the
figure. the set has to be doubled by an analogous one with a permuted
pair of external lines. we have not shown diagrams involving only - in-
teractions, which contain only renormalizable divergences. also we have not
shown tadpoles and external line self-energy insertion diagrams, correspond-
ing to mass and wave function renormalizations.

situation can be summarized as follows. the following pairs of diagrams
are nite, although each diagram is separately divergent: (a, b), (c, d), (e, f),
(g, h), (i, j). diagrams (k), (l) are individually nite. vertex diagrams (m),
(n) are logarithmically, and (o), (p), (q), (r) quadratically divergent. the
divergences turn out to be momentum-independent, so that in principle they
might be cured by coupling constant (eventually mf , m) renormalization.
quadratical divergences in diagrams (s), (t) can be assigned to vector eld
mass and wave function renormalization. one is left with the quartically
divergent self-energy graph (u). its contribution reads

f = 2g4m2

f u(pf )u(pi)u(qf )u(qi)

the k-independent term can be absorbed into  mass renormalization; the

as no other divergences are available to cancel it, this suces to prove our
point.

it is relevant to consider the same process in the theory modied to
accommodate linearity in the - coupling. it is not hard to see that the
only way to achieve this, without changing the particle spectrum, is to resort
to the familiar choice with -chiral components behaving dierently under
the gauge transformations. one can set, without loss of generality,

l  eigl, r  r,

(11)

where l, r are the left and right-hand projections of , respectively. this
does not aect l1, but maintaining u(1) gauge invariance requests replacing
l2 with
2 = i (  ig
l
2 theory is the appelquist and quinn model [6] used
the resulting l = l1+l
in the early days of the electroweak theory to test divergence cancellations
in unitary gauge calculations. in this gauge, the corresponding s matrix still
follows from the previously dened hef f , with the sole modication in lint

replacement (13) proves essential for divergence cancellations.
it is obvi-
ous that in both theories the set of the contributing feynamn graphs is the
same. now situation presents as follows. diagrams (a) and (b) summed
yield a logarithmic divergence which equals f n r
 . diagrams (k), (l) produce
logarithmic and quadratically divergences, which added yield, for each di-
agram, f n r
 . these four diagrams thus exactly cancel the divergence in
diagram (u). the rest of diagrams contain either renormalizable innities, or
non-renormalizable ones corresponding to a pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar four-
fermion interaction, cancelling among themselvesc.

csee ref.

[6]. cancellation of the one-loop non-renormalizable divergences was also

checked, although not by evaluating individual graphs in momentum space, in ref. [7].

in conclusion, the lesson to be drawn from this example is that one should
be cautious in extending renormalizability to models with fermion-scalar
terms non-linear in the higgs elds, even though formal power counting might
suggest it is possible.
