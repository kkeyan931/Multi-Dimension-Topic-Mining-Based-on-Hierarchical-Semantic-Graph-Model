abstract

in this paper we sum over the spherical modes appearing in the
expression for the casimir energy of a sphere before doing the fre-
quency integration. we derive closed integral expressions that allow
the calculations to be done to all orders, without the use of regulariza-
tion procedures. the technique of mode summation using a contour
integral is critically examined.

1 introduction

the casimir eect is a remarkable consequence of qft, exhibiting the reality
of the zero point energy of the vacuum. this energy can be made manifest by
studying its dependence on various constraints imposed on the electromag-
netic eld. casimirs [1] original analysis for parallel plates yielded a force
per unit area ( = c = 1)

between two conducting plates separated by a distance a. the casimir force
for a conducting spherical shell was rst calculated by boyer [2]. the result
was indeed puzzling: the force turned out to be repulsive. this was surpris-
ing in view of the connection between casimirs force and van-der-waals

forces which are attractive. this phenomenon may be also related to a fun-
damental dierence between the spherical casimir problem and that of the
plates: expansion of the sphere changes the distances between the points on
the shell itself, and thus it is not clear weather the casimir energy (associated
with interaction among dierent patches on the shell) and electromagnetic
the self energy of the shell can be separated [3]. it is not surprising, how-
ever, that this in turn called for a large number of subsequent calculations by
various techniques [4, 5, 6, 7]. there has been some controversy concerning
the regularization procedures used in the calculations, bearing, for example
on the relevance of casimirs eect to sonoluminescence [8, 9, 10, 11]. since
the repulsive nature of the casimir force for spherical boundary conditions
is somewhat counterintuitive it seems of importance to justify it more rigor-
ously.

n

we dene the casimir energy of a conducting sphere as follows: let
(a,r)
be the eigenmodes of the electromagnetic eld inside two concentric
spherical shells of radii a and r (a << r), where a large sphere of radius
r is introduced as an infrared cuto in order to discretize the spectrum
outside the smaller sphere as well as inside it. the zero point energy of this
system, namely 1
is a divergent sum. the casimir energy is then
dened as the zero point energy dierence between our conguration and a
conguration where the inner sphere is of radius b (a << b < r) [12]2

here en is an exponential regulator. we show that if the subtraction
procedure is done properly, no further regularization (apart from keeping the
naive exponential regulator, required to make the sums well dened, and
the subtraction) is actually needed.
in the sequel , we follow closely the
procedure of mode summation using a contour integral, but our main result
can also be applied to the greens function method [6].
most of the calculations have been carried out for the case of a conducting
sphere and of a dilute dielectric ball under the assumption  =  = 1
[13], where ,  are the permittivity and permeability of the medium sur-
rounding a ball of radius a, and ,  are the permittivity and permeability
inside the ball. it has been shown that the casimir energy in the latter case

2this form of subtraction has the advantage of having a natural one to one correspon-
dence between the eigenmodes of the constrained system (inner radius a) to those of the
unconstrained one (where b and r are taken to )

and in the end of the calculation the regulator  is taken to zero.
in the
case  = 1, (3) is equivalent to the expression for the energy of a conducting
sphere in vacuum.

in order to evaluate (3), extensive use has been made of uniform asymp-
totic approximations of the modied bessel functions sl(x) and el(x). our
evaluation refrains from the use of these asymptotics, which, although very
convenient in actual calculations, somewhat obscures the nature of the ex-
pression (3). by studying the l-sum of this expression before making the
frequency integration, using simple orthogonality considerations we arrive at

a general formula for sums of the formp(2l+1)(slel)n. we show that to rst

order in 2 the integrand consists of a constant term (which is independent of
the radius) and a function of a. thus the divergence appearing in the eval-
uation of (3) is due to integration of this constant over all frequencies. this
divergence was already pointed out by candelas [15], however, this constant
term would not be present if subtraction of the casimir energy of a large
radius sphere is done properly.

we start by carefully reviewing the procedure of mode summation, using
a contour integral, as was done in some previous works [7, 14, 16]. in this
method the nal integration is carried along the imaginary axis. however, no
satisfactory justication for the neglect of the part of the contour away from
this axis has been given, since, to the best of our knowledge, the existence
of an innite number of poles of the integrand on the real axis was not, to
our judgment, properly accounted for. we hope that the present treatment
claries some of these technical points as well.

2 mode summation for conducting spherical

shells

in order to make the discussion well dened we investigate the following
situation [16]: a conducting sphere of radius a is placed (concentrically)
inside a large conducting sphere of radius r. using multipole expansion [17]
the appropriate modes of the electromagnetic elds can be found, through
the boundary conditions br = 0 and e, = 0 on the shells. the eigenmodes
are given as solutions to the equations:

after the limits r   and b   are taken the remaining expression
will have no reference to r and b. removal of the ultra-violet cut o by
taking the limit   0 is done in the end of the derivation, after insuring
convergence for all values of b and r.
in order to make the evaluation of the contour integrals easier we take
rectangular contours of side ln (fig. 1). our rst aim is to carry the entire
integration along the imaginary axis, by showing that the contribution of
the part of the contour away from it vanishes as ln goes to innity. the
justication of this neglect, however, is not obvious, since the integrand in

5

(13) has innitely many singularities along the real axis, which become ever
denser as r  . this follows from the property that for any nite r there
is an innite number of eld modes, and subsequently there is a corresponding
innite number of poles of z d
dz ln l(z, b, r) along the real axis. even after
taking the limit r   the spectrum will still consist of a discrete set
(eigenmodes inside the inner shell) imbedded in a continuum part. indeed,
let us examine the behavior of l(; a, r) for large arguments . using the
asymptotic behavior [17]

thus for large arguments the modes behave as n
2(ra) where n is an
integer. (note that the density of modes for large frequencies is similar to
that appearing in the one dimensional version of the standard casimir eect
for parallel conducting plates separated by a distance a inside a large box
of length r.) let us examine the behavior of the integrand for large values
of ||. substituting the asymptotics (18), we show that the integral on a
contour that does not pass through one of the poles, decays exponentially
fast. the integrand is then simply:

fl(; a, b, r) = 2(cid:0)a(cot(2a  l)  cot((r  a))) +
r(cot((r  a))  cot((r  b))) +
b(cot((r  a))  cot(2b  l))(cid:1)

it is easy to check that for im    and any real a, b,
| cot(a)  cot(b)| = o(e2min(a,b)im )

(19)

(20)

thus on the upper and lower parts of the contour (im z = ln ) the integral
is bounded by:

z ln

the part of the contour with re z = ln can be evaluated as follows. first
we prove that integrals of the form

z l

(22)

decay exponentially as l   as long as we avoid the poles (i.e. kl 6= n).

(23)

this is enough to ensure exponential decay for any kl 6= n, since we can
shift the right side from ln to ln

over the part of the contour with re z > 0 decays exponentially like eln .
in the limit ln   we obtain the desired equality:

in agreement with (3). note that the usual derivation of (3) involves a
rescaling x = a. in our derivation we avoided this step and as a result,
were able to identify the term in the -integral which is independent of the
radius.

3 expansion in 2: rst order

in the previous section we reviewed the derivation of the expression for the
casimir energy of a conducting sphere. the casimir energy of a dielectric
ball, under the condition  =  = 1 [7, 14] can be calculated at no
further cost by repeating essentially the same steps as in the conducting case.
from now on this will be the setting, with  = 1 (4) corresponding to the
previous section. we now show that the sum over the angular index l in
(3) can be carried out before doing the integration over the frequencies. we
assume 2 small, and expand the logarithm in (3) in powers of 2. the rst
term in this expansion is

2

(slel)2.

(28)

it turns out that the sum over l in (28) can be done exactly. to this end,
note the following identity, which can easily be obtained from the expansion
of the helmholtz propagator in spherical coordinates [18] using relations (5)
and (6),

the following can, of course, be carried out for arbitrary r and r . this

should be useful in the more general case where  6= , since the
expressions appearing in that case involve combinations of sl(x)el(x) where
x =  and x =  [8], but in the present case r = r = 1 is just
what we need. using the orthogonality relations of the pls

we note the appearance of a term 2

causes (3) to diverge. we dispose of it by subtracting from (33) the appro-

obtain the density

 = 1 corresponds to the case of a conducting sphere.
it turns out that
this result has already been derived for a conducting sphere, by balian and
duplantier [5] using a multiple scattering formalism, which may be applied
in the case of conducting boundaries of arbitrary shape. using a greens
function method, milton, deraad and schwinger [6] evaluated the casimir
energy for a conducting sphere, numerically, to be 1
2a0.092353. this is in
accordance with our calculation, since the next term in the 2 expansion of (3)
may be evaluated using the debye asymptotic expansion of bessel functions
to be  1
2a 0.007. however, for a dilute sphere ( << 1) our result is the exact
one. note that our result was obtained using only subtraction of energies,
which is in the denition of the casimir energy. no further regularization of
the expression (28) was necessary.

4 an integral expression for higher orders in

2

generalization of the method we developed in the previous section to higher
orders in 2, is possible. to this end, we derive a general formula for sums
l , for arbitrary power n, and coecients al, when

of the form pl(l + 1/2)an
the function f (x) =pl(l + 1/2)alpl(x) is known. let us rst introduce the

9

following transform

1

dtf(cid:0)xy p(1  x2)(1  y2) cos t(cid:1)
this transform has the simple property that if f (x) =pl alpl(x) then

f (x)  bf(x, y) =

alpl(x)pl(y)

(36)

(37)

0

z 
bf (x, y) =xl

to see this, we write x = cos , y = cos  and consider the following well
known addition formula:

pl(cos ) = pl(cos )pl(cos ) + 2

lxm=1

p m
l (cos )p m

l (cos ) cos(m(  ))
(38)

where  is the angle between two unit vectors with spherical coordinates
(, ) and (, ), that is

(39)

(40)

cos  = cos  cos  + sin  sin  cos(  )

setting  = t and  = 0, we obtain:

f (cos  cos   sin  sin  cos t) =pl alpl(cos ) =

m=1 p m

l (cos )p m

pl al(cid:2)pl(cos )pl(cos ) + 2pl

l (cos ) cos(mt)(cid:3)

integrating over t, we eliminate all the terms containing cos t, and are left

with pl alpl(x)pl(y) as claimed. using (37) and (31) repeatedly, we obtain

it is not dicult to check that (42) indeed converges but, unfortunately, we
have not succeeded in integrating it analytically.

5 discussion

in this paper we developed and used a novel method appropriate for calcu-
lations of the casimir energy for spherical boundary conditions. although
the use of the asymptotic debye approximation is very convenient, we have
shown that it is possible to make a direct summation over angular modes us-
ing the expansion of the helmholtz propagator in spherical harmonics. this
method can be applied to obtain closed integral representations for any order
in the 2 expansion of the casimir energy (3). the 2 order was explicitly
calculated to be 52
32a , this result is within 0.2% of results obtained via the
debye approximations [14], demonstrating their high accuracy. higher orders
in 2 however, still remain in integral form.

our method should be applicable to other sums of the type (28) and
variations on them [8], which are common in the calculations for spherical
boundaries, in order to get more regularization independent results. the fact
that summation using angular integrals over the propagator of the helmholtz
equation through (41) can be done to all orders, reects the relation between
the mode summation technique and calculations using greens function. this
can be seen for the case of conducting boundaries in the multiple scattering
formalism [5]. it would be illuminating to reveal the connections between
our method and other methods of calculation in the dielectric case, involving
summation over dipoles, such as calculations of the casimir energy using
the statistical mechanics partition function as was performed by hye and
brevik [19].
