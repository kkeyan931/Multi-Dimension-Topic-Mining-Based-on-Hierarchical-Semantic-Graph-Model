abstract

the hypermultiplet low-energy eective action (leea) in n=2 supersymmet-
ric four-dimensional (4d) gauge theories can receive both perturbative (at one loop)
and non-perturbative (due to instantons) quantum corrections. the manifestly n=2
supersymmetric feynman rules in harmonic (twistor) superspace are used to calcu-
late the perturbative hypermultiplet leea that results in the taub-nut non-linear
sigma-model. the harmonic superspace also implies the unique general form of the
non-perturbative contributions whose geometrical meaning can be best understood
after an n=2 duality transformation from the n=2 harmonic superspace to the n=2
projective superspace, in terms of an o(4) projective n=2 supermultiplet. the exact
hypermultiplet leea is given by the n=2 non-linear sigma-model with the two-
parameter family of atiyah-hitchin metrics, while the corresponding action in n=2
projective superspace is encoded in terms of the auxiliary elliptic curve. this is very
reminiscent to the seminal seiberg-witten construction of the exact 4d, n=2 vector
multiplet leea in the coulomb branch. our 4d results are in agreement with the
earlier proposals of seiberg and witten about the 3d hypermultiplet quantum moduli
space related to 3d, n=4 supersymmetric gauge eld theories via the c-map.

1 introduction

the exact gauge low-energy eective action (leea) in the coulomb branch of n=2
supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills theory in four spacetime dimensions (4d), which
includes both perturbative (one-loop) and nonperturbative (instanton) quantum cor-
rections, was determined by seiberg and witten [1]. the main tools of their con-
struction were the general constraints implied by n=2 extended supersymmetry, the
anomaly structure of n=2 quantum gauge eld theory, and duality transformations. 3
in particular, the 4d o-shell n=2 supersymmetry implies the unique ansatz for the
n=2 (abelian) vector multiplet leea, in terms of a holomorphic function f (w ) of
the n=2 (restricted chiral) supereld strength w . the chiral anomaly determines the
perturbative (logarithmic) contribution to the function f (w ). the nonperturbative
consistency and electric-magnetic duality unambiguously x instanton corrections to
f (w ). the instanton corrections are related to the bps monopoles representing
nonperturbative degrees of freedom and belonging to hypermultiplets. perhaps most
remarkably, the exact seiberg-witten solution can be nicely encoded in terms of the
auxiliary elliptic curve (a torus) sw, in terms of a certain abelian dierential sw
(of the 3rd kind) integrated over the torus periods.

since 4d, n=2 gauge eld theory has both n=2 vector multiplets and hypermul-
tiplets, the latter also have their own n=2 supersymmetric leea [3]. the hyper-
multiplet leea is highly constrained by n=2 extended supersymmetry and anomaly
structure too, so that its exact form may also be determined. some important insights
were obtained by seiberg and witten in three spacetime dimensions [4]. they used
the so-called c-map relating the special kahler geometry of the n=2 vector multiplet
moduli space to the hyper-kahler geometry of the hypermultiplet moduli space [5]. 4
our main purpose in this paper is to determine the hypermultiplet leea directly in
four dimensions from the same fundamental input used to x the n=2 vector mul-
tiplet (seiberg-witten) leea. we conne ourselves to a single hypermultiplet for
simplicity. we fully exploit the restrictions implied by o-shell n=2 supersymmetry
by making it manifest in n=2 superspace. the nonanomalous internal symmetry
su(2)r is crucial for a derivation of the hyper-kahler potential governing the hyper-
multiplet leea in harmonic superspace (hss). dualizing the hss action into n=2
projective superspace (pss) allows us to calculate the eective hyper-kahler metric.
the solution can be put into the seiberg-witten form after introducing the auxiliary
elliptic curve associated with an o(4) projective multiplet in n=2 pss [6].

2 n=2 supersymmetry and hyper-kahler metrics



i , 

the scalar kinetic part of the hypermultiplet leea is of the second order in space-
time derivatives, and it thus takes the form of a non-linear sigma-model (nlsm).
by n=2 supersymmetry in 4d, the metric of this 4d nlsm has to be hyper-kahler
[7, 6]. making n=2 supersymmetry manifest (i.e o-shell) should therefore make the
hyper-kahler nature of the hypermultiplet leea also manifest. however, unlike the
n=2 vector multiplet, no o-shell (i.e. model-independent) formulation in the stan-
i) exists
dard 4d, n=2 superspace parametrized by the coordinates z m = (x, 
for the most fundamental (fayet-sohnius) hypermultiplet having a complex su(2)r
doublet of physical scalars. nevertheless, it does exist in the twistor extension of the
n=2 superspace known as harmonic superspace (hss) [8]. any hyper-kahler mani-
fold is characterized by a covariantly constant quaternionic structure comprising three
linearly independent (integrable) complex structures, say, i, j and k, satisfying a
quaternionic algebra. 5 it is easy to verify that a linear combination, ai+bj +ck, with
some real coecients (a, b, c) also represents a covariantly constant complex structure
provided that a2 + b2 + c2 = 1. hence, the hyper-kahler manifold possesses a variety
of complex structures, worthy of riemann sphere s2. it is therefore natural to add
s2 to the ordinary n=2 superspace by extending it to n=2 hss. since s2 is isomor-
phic to the complex projective line cp (1), a cp (1)-extension of the standard n=2
superspace (or, equivalently, a holomorphic projection of hss) is also possible, while
it is known as n=2 projective superspace (pss) [7, 6]. though the hss approach is
the most symmetric and universal one, it also implies the innite number of auxiliary
elds (e.g. in an o-shell n=2 supersymmetric formulation of the fayet-sohnius hy-
permultiplet), which makes highly non-trivial its relation to the component approach
and hyper-kahler geometry. the pss approach can be formulated with a nite num-
ber of auxiliary elds for a restricted class of n=2 nlsm. we are going to formulate
the hypermultiplet leea in hss and then dualize it into pss in a manifestly n=2
supersymmetric way.

in the hss approach one adds harmonics ui parametrizing the riemann sphere

s2  su(2)/u(1) and satisfying the relations

u+iu

i = 1 ,

u+iu+

i = uiu

i = 0 ,

ui+ = u

then one can make manifest a hidden analyticity structure of the standard n=2

5a complex description of the hyper-kahler manifold arises when one of its complex structures

is chosen in the canonical form, e.g. in the n=1 superspace description of n=2 nlsm.

superspace constraints dening both n=2 vector multiplets and fayet-sohnius hy-
permultipets, and nd their manifestly n=2 supersymmetric solutions in terms of
unconstrained (analytic) n=2 superelds. 6 instead of using an explicit parametriza-
tion of the sphere s2, it is often more convenient to deal with functions of harmonics,
which carry a denite u(1) charge dened by u(u
i ) = 1, and use the simple inte-
gration rules

z du = 1 ,

and

z du u+(i1    u+imuj1    ujn) = 0 , otherwise .

(2.2)

it is obvious that any harmonic integral over a u(1)-charged quantity vanishes.

the usual complex conjugation does not preserve analyticity. however, it does,
after being combined with another (star) conjugation that only acts on u(1) indices

it preserves analyticity, and it allows one to integrate by parts. in what follows we
omit the explicit reference to the analytic basis in order to simplify our notation.

it is the advantage of hss that both an o-shell n=2 vector multiplet and an
o-shell hypermultiplet can be introduced there on equal footing. for example, the

fayet-sohnius hypermultiplet is naturally described in hss by an unconstrained com-
plex analytic supereld q+ of u(1) charge (+1). the notion of analyticity in n=2
supersymmetry is apparently more fundamental than the notion of holomorphicity,
whereas the latter is natural in n=1 supersymmetry and is extendable to (abelian)
n=2 vector multiplets only. an n=2 vector multiplet in hss is described by an
unconstrained analytic supereld v ++ of u(1) charge (+2). the hss supered v ++
= v ++, while it
is real with respect to the analyticity preserving conjugation, v ++
can be naturally introduced as a connection to the harmonic derivative d++.



an n=2 manifestly supersymmetric free hypermultiplet hss action reads 7

s[q] =

q +d++q+ =

(2.7)

where we have introduced the notation q+
minimal coupling to an abelian n=2 gauge supereld v ++ reads

q +, q+), qa+ = abq+

a = (



b and a = 1, 2. its

s[q, v ] = z d (4)du



q +(d++ + iv ++)q+ .

(2.8)

both actions are also manifestly invariant under the su(2)r automorphisms, just
because of the absence of explicit dependence of the hss lagrangian upon harmonics.
the action (2.7) possesses the extra su(2)pg internal symmetry rotating the doublet
q+
a , whereas this symmetry is apparently broken in eq. (2.8) to its u(1) subgroup.
the massless hss action (2.7) is, in fact, invariant under the full n=2 superconformal
symmetry isomorphic to su(2, 2|2) that also leaves the analytic subspace invariant.
the supergroup su(2, 2|2) contains yet another su(2)conf. that can be identied
on-shell with su(2)r.

a hypermultiplet (bps) mass can only come from central charges in n=2 super-
symmetry algebra. the most natural way to introduce central charges (z, z) is to
identify them with spontaneously broken u(1)r generators of dimensional reduction
from six dimensions via the scherk-schwarz mechanism [9]. after being rewritten
to six dimensions and then compactied down to four dimensions, the harmonic
derivative (2.6) receives the additional connection term in 4d,

d++ = d++ + v++ , where

v++ = i(++) z + i(+ +)z .

(2.9)

the n=2 central charges can thus be equivalently treated as the abelian n=2 vector
supereld background with the covariantly constant n=2 gauge supereld strength
hwi = z. the non-vanishing n=2 central charges break the rigid u(1)r symmetry,
7our superelds are all dimensionless, whereas the constant  in front of our actions has dimension

of length. in what follows we set  = 1 for notational simplicity.

symmetry breaking results in the appearance of anomalous terms in the n=2 gauge
leea [1] and in the hypermultiplet leea as well [9].

the general n=2 nlsm lagrangian in hss reads [10]

l(+4) = 



q +d++q+  k(+4)(



q +, q+; u) ,

(2.10)

where the hss potential k+(4) is called a hyper-kahler potential. the analytic func-
tion k+(4) in the hypermultiplet leea (2.10) plays the role similar to that of the
holomorphic seiberg-witten potential f in the n=2 gauge leea. because of mani-
fest n=2 supersymmetry, the equations of motion for the hss action (2.10) determine
(at least, in principle) the component hyper-kahler nlsm metric in terms of a sin-
gle analytic function k(+4). an explicit form of this relation is, however, not known
in general. a crucial simplication arises when the hyper-kahler potential k(+4) is
independent upon harmonics, which immediately implies a general solution in the
form

k(+4) =

with one real () and two complex (, ) parameters. the su(2)pg transformations
of q+
a leave the form of eq. (2.11) invariant but not the coecients. since su(2)pg is
the invariance of the free hypermultiplet action (2.7), it may be used to reduce the
number of coupling constants in the family of hyper-kahler metrics associated with
the hyper-kahler potential (2.11) from ve to two. it is going to be crucial for our
purposes (see the next sections) that eq. (2.11) implies the conservation law [10]

3 perturbative hypermultiplet leea

the manifestly n=2 supersymmetric hss description of the hypermultiplet leea
allows us to exploit the constraints imposed by unbroken n=2 supersymmetry and
its automorphism symmetry in a very ecient and transparent way. for example, as
regards quantum perturbation theory in 4d, n=2 supersymmetric qed (related to
the coulomb branch), the unbroken internal symmetry is given by

the induced coupling constant  in eq. (3.2) is entirely determined by the one-

to understand the hyper-kahler geometry associated with the hyper-kahler po-
tential (3.2), one may perform an n=2 duality transformation of the fayet-sohnius
hypermultiplet to an n=2 tensor multiplet, and then rewrite the corresponding dual
hss action into pss. unlike the fayet-sohnius hypermultiplet, the n=2 tensor multi-
plet has a nite number of auxiliary elds. lets recall that the n=2 tensor multiplet
supereld l(ij)(z) in the standard n=2 superspace is dened by the o-shell con-
straints [7, 6]

and it is subject to the reality condition

(ilik) = d

respectively. we are now going to make a substitution

or, equivalently,



q +q+ = 2il++ ,

(3.16)

that is certainly allowed because of eq. (2.12). the constraints (3.7) can be incorpo-
rated o-shell by using extra real analytic supereld  as the lagrange multiplier.
q +, q+) to (l++, ) then amounts to an n=2 duality
changing the variables from (
transformation in hss. the explicit solution to eq. (3.16) is known [11]:



q+ = i(cid:16)2u+

q + = i(cid:16)2u+

.

(3.18)

it is now straightforward to rewrite the free (massless) hss action (2.7) in terms of
the new variables. it results in the improved (i.e. n=2 superconformally invariant)
n=2 tensor multiplet action [11]

simpr. =

1

2 z d (4)du(f ++)2 .

(3.19)

the action dual to the nlsm action dened by eqs. (2.10) and (3.2) is therefore
given by a sum of the non-improved (quadratic) and improved (non-polynomial) hss
actions for the n=2 tensor multiplet [7, 11],

(3.20)

where we have rescaled the whole action by a factor of .

9

to understand the peculiar structure of the improved action dened by eqs. (3.18)
and (3.19), one may extract a constant piece cij out of lij by rewriting it to the form

l++(, u) = c++ + l++(, u) .

(3.21)

we use the notation

c = ciju

i u
j

,

(cij) = ikjlckl ,

c2 =

1
2

cijcij 6= 0 ,

f ++(l, u)  l++f (y) ,

y = l++c .

the function f (y) now appears to be a solution to the quadratic equation,

1

f (y)

= 1 +

yf (y)

4c2

,

(3.22)

(3.23)

which results from requiring the rigid n=2 superconformal invariance on the improved
action (cf. ref. [11]). the action (3.19) does not really depend upon cij because of its
su(2)conf. invariance. in the sum (3.20), the relative normalization constant c = 2
is the only relevant parameter.

it is also straightforward to rewrite eq. (3.20) into n=2 pss or even n=1 super-

space, where it takes the form of eq. (3.11) or (3.14), respecively, with

in complex -plane [7, 6]. the hyper-kahler metric of the n=2 nlsm dened by
eqs. (3.20) and (3.24) is known to be equivalent to the taub-nut metric (after
the n=1 superspace legendre transform) [7], with the mass parameter m = 1
21/2.
eq. (3.2) therefore describes the hyper-kahler hss potential of the taub-nut metric
[10]. 8

the known su(2)  u(1) isometry of the taub-nut metric is clearly consistent
with eq. (3.1). it is instructive to investigate the realization of this internal symmetry
in the various formulations of the n=2 taub-nut nlsm given above. the hyper-
kahler potential (3.2) in terms of the fayet-sohnius hypermultiplet q+ provides the
manifestly invariant formulation. in the dual hss form, in terms of (l++, ), the
non-abelian factor su(2) is represented by the su(2)conf., whereas the abelian factor

while a generic pss action (3.11) is not invariant under these transformations by

invariant under the transformations (3.26) provided that

by o-shell counting the independent bosonic (#b) and fermionic (#f ) eld compo-
nents of the o(4) supermultiplet and insisting on #b = #f implied by o-shell n=2
supersymmetry. the same argument also implies the absence of the related u(1)r
triholomorphic isometry in the n=2 nlsm to be constructed in terms of l++++.

eq. (4.8) reduces the number of independent n=2 nlsm physical real scalars from
ve to four, which is consistent with the well-known fact that the real dimension of any
hyper-kahler manifold is a multiple of four [7]. after solving the constraint (4.8), the
complex linear n=1 supereld h can be traded for yet another n=1 chiral supereld
, by the use of the n=1 supereld legendre transform that results in the n=1
superspace kahler potential k(, , , ) associated with the n=2 supersymmetric
nlsm of eq. (4.7) [7].

a straightforward procedure of calculating the dependence q(l), as well as per-
forming an explicit n=2 duality transformation of the free action (2.7) into the dual
action in terms of the constrained n=2 supereld dened by eq. (4.1), use the roots
of the quartic polynomial. though it is possible to calculate them, the results are
cumbersome and, hence, are not very illuminating. remarkably, knowing the explicit

9in fact, it also applies to any projective o(2k) multiplets satisfying the o-shell n=2 superspace

constraints generalizing those of eqs. (4.3) and (4.4) with k > 2 [6].

roots of the quartic is not absolutely necessary to determine the form of the dual
n=2 action in terms of the n=2 projective o(4) supereld (4.5). in the manifestly
n=2 supersymmetric approach the su(2)r invariance alone has the power to x the
action dual to that of eq. (2.7) either in hss or pss (cf. ref. [11]). the one real
and two complex constants, (, , ), respectively, parametrizing the hyper-kahler
potential (2.11) are naturally united into an su(2) 5-plet cijkl subject to the reality
condition (4.4). after extracting a constant piece out of q+, say, q+
a and
ua = (1, ), and collecting all constant pieces on the left-hand-side of eq. (4.1), we
can identify their sum with a constant piece c++++ = cijklu+
l of l++++ on
the right-hand-side of eq. (4.1), representing the constant vacuum expectation values
of the n=1 supereld components of l++++ dened by eq. (4.6), i.e.

(4.9)

the su(2)r transformations in pss are the projective transformations (3.26), so
that the pss potential g of the improved o(4) multiplet action having the form

(4.11)

with one real (r) and two complex (p, q) additional parameters belonging to yet
another 5-plet of su(2). the projective su(2) invariance of the pss action dened by
eqs. (4.7) and (4.11) can be used to reduce the number of independent parameters in
the corresponding family of hyper-kahler metrics from ve to two, which is consistent
with the hss predictions of sect. 2. 10 we didnt attempt to establish an explicit
relation between the hss coecients (, , ) and the pss coecients (r, q, p). a
nontrivial example is already provided by the equation

q2

4() = 0 ,

(4.12)

and it is going to be the only case we discuss in what follows. the nontrivial gener-
alization (4.11) is likely to lead to the hyper-kahler metrics with singularities.

10the generalization of eq. (3.25) similarly to eq. (4.11) is empty since the quadratic polynomial

because of the reality condition (4.4), the quartic (4.12) has two pairs of roots

4() = c(  1)(1 + 1)(  2)(2 + 1) .

the branch cuts of the root in eq. (4.14) can be chosen to run from 1 to 1/2 and

in terms of the euler angles (, , ) and the modulus k representing the indepen-
dent (supereld) coordinates of the n=2 nlsm under consideration. as was also
demonstrated in ref. [12], applying the legendre transform to the function (4.13)

14

with respect to h gives rise to the atiyah-hitchin (ah) space m2 as the nlsm
target space.

the ah space m2 was originally introduced as the moduli space of two bps su(2)
monopoles [13]. the metric of the ah space is also known to be the only regular
hyper-kahler metric of a gravitational instanton with entirely non-triholomorphic
so(3) symmetry rotating hyper-kahler complex structures [13]. in the donaldson
description [14] of the ah space, m2 is described by the quotient of an algebraic curve
in c3,

x2  zy2 = 1 , where x, y, z  c ,

(4.20)

under z2 :
(x, y, z)  (x,y, z). eq. (4.20) thus describes the su(2)-symmetric
universal (2-fold) covering m2 of the ah space. since our n=2 superspace techniques
are purely local, we are unable to distinguish between m2 and m2. accordingly, we
make no distinction between so(3) and su(2) in our considerations in this paper. 11

the line element of any four-dimensional (euclidean) metric with the so(3) sym-

metry can be written down in the bianchi ix formalism as

ds2 = f 2(t)dt2 + a2(t)2

1 + b2(t)2

2 + c2(t)2

where f (t) = 1

in terms of the euler angles (, , ). the 1-forms (4.22) obey the relations

i  j = 1

2 ijkdk ,

i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 .

(4.21)

(4.22)

(4.23)

the standard parametrization of the ah metric uses the complete elliptic integrals

that suggests us to make a redenition

and describe the same limit at   0. after substituting eq. (4.27) into eq. (4.26)

and having the negative mass parameter m =  1
in monopole physics, the
ah metric describes scattering of two centered bps su(2) monopoles. when the
monopoles are well-separated, their moduli space is well approximated by the taub-
nut metric indeed [13].

(4.29)

in the context of the hypermultiplet leea, the perturbative taub-nut metric
(sect. 3) cannot be the ultimate (exact) solution since it preserves the extra u(1)r
symmetry that is broken by instanton corrections. the extra u(1)r symmetry of the
taub-nut metric is the direct consequence of the relation a2 = b2 that arises from
the ah metric merely in the asymptotic limit described by eq. (4.29). moreover, the
ah metric seems to be the only regular solution to the hypermultiplet leea that
preserves the su(2)r symmetry present in nonperturbative 4d, n=2 supersymmetric
quantum eld theory [1]. it is the vicinity of k  0+ that describes the region of
the hypermultiplet moduli space where quantum perturbation theory applies, with
the exponentially small ah corrections to the taub-nut metric being interpreted as
the nonperturbative instanton contributions to the hypermultiplet leea (related to
the existence of bps monopoles in the underlying n=2 eld theory). the ah metric
as the metric in the hypermultiplet quantum moduli space was proposed by seiberg

16

and witten [4] in the context of 3d, n=4 supersymmetric gauge eld theories, where
it can be related to the (seiberg-witten) gauge leea [1] via the c-map in three
spacetime dimensions. 12

from the n=2 pss viewpoint, the transition from the perturbative hypermulti-
plet leea to the nonperturbative one corresponds to the transition from the o(2)
holomorphic line bundle associated with the standard n=2 tensor supermultiplet to
the o(4) holomorphic line bundle associated with the o(4) n=2 supermultiplet. the
two holomorphic bundles are topologically dierent: with respect to a standard cov-
ering of cp (1) by two open ane sets, the o(2) bundle has transition functions
1, whereas the o(4) bundle has transition functions 2. the variable q is the
coordinate of the corresponding ber over cp (1).

5 atiyah-hitchin metric and elliptic curve

the quadratic dependence of q2
2 on  in eqs. (3.10) and (3.13) allows us to globally
interpret it as a holomorphic (of degree 2) section of pss, bered by the superelds
(, h) and topologically equivalent to a complex line (or riemann sphere of genus
0). similarly, the quartic dependence of q2
4 on  in eqs. (4.5) and (4.6) allows us
to globally interpret it as a holomorphic (of degree 4) section of pss, bered by
the superelds (, h, v ) and topologically equivalent to an elliptic curve hyper. (or
a torus of genus 1). the non-perturbative hypermultiplet leea can therefore be
encoded in terms of the genus-one riemann surface hyper. in a close analogy to the
exact n=2 gauge leea in terms of the elliptic curve sw of seiberg and witten [1].

the classical twistor construction of hyper-kahler metrics [13] is known to be
closely associated with the hurtubise elliptic curve h [17]. the spectral curve h
naturally arises in the process of uniformization of the algebraic curve (4.20) in the
donaldson description of the ah space [18], so that it can be identied with hyper..
the equation dening an elliptic curve can be put into the normal (hurtubise) form
[13]

(5.1)
that is simply related to another standard (weierstrass) form, y2 = 4x3  g2x  g3
[19]. therefore, in accordance with refs. [13, 19], the real period  of h is

4( ) = k 2(k) hkk( 2  1) + (k2  k2) i ,

eq. (5.5) implies the following parametrization of the supereld coecients of the

k 2(k)h2  k2 + 3 sin2 (cid:16)k2 cos2   1(cid:17)i ,

(5.6)

where the notation   log(cid:16)tan 

2(cid:17) + i has been used [18].

at generic values of the ah modulus k, 0 < k < 1, the roots of the weierstrass
form are all dierent from each other, while they all lie on the real axis, say, at
e3 < e2 < e1 <  = (e4). accordingly, the branch cuts are running from e3 to e2
and from e1 to . the cr integration contour in the pss formulation of the exact
hypermultiplet leea in eq. (4.13) can now be interpreted as the contour integral
over the non-contractible a-cycle of the elliptic curve h [18], in very much the same
way like the seiberg-witten solution to the n=2 su(2) gauge leea is written down
in terms of the abelian dierential sw integrated over the periods of sw [1].

the perturbative (taub-nut) limit k  1 corresponds to the situation when
e2  e1, so that the b-cycle of h degenerates. the curve (5.1) then asymptotically
approaches a complex line, q4  k . another limit, k  0, leads to a coordinate
bolt-type singularity of the ah metric in the standard parameterization (4.25) [13].

18

in the context of monopole physics, this corresponds to the coincidence limit of two
centered monopoles.
in the context of the hypermultiplet leea, k  0 implies
e2  e3, so that the a-cycle of h degenerates, as well as the whole hypermultiplet
action associated with eq. (4.13). the two limits, k  1 and k  0, are related
by the modular transformation exchanging k with k, and a-cycle with b-cycle [18].
the non-perturbative corrections to the hypermultiplet leea are therefore dictated
by the hidden (in 4d) elliptic curve parametrizing the exact solution. since the
seiberg-witten curve sw is known to have the simple geometrical interpretation
in m-theory, where it can be considered as the part of a magnetically charged ve-
brane worldvolume wrapped about sw [20], it is conceivable that the hypermultiplet
elliptic curve h may have a similar geometrical interpretation, perhaps, related to
d-6-branes in ten-dimensional spacetime [3].

6 conclusion

the 4d twistor approach is known to have many similarities with the inverse scattering
method in the theory of (lower dimensional) integrable systems.
it its turn, the
integrable systems are known to be closely connected with hyper-kahler geometry
and the theory of riemann surfaces [21]. in our approach to a construction of the 4d
hypermultiplet leea, it was the passage from the n=2 harmonic superspace (hss)
to the n=2 projective superspace (pss) that provided the link of harmonic analysis
to complex analysis and thus allowed us to introduce the holomorphic quantities
interpreted in terms of the elliptic curve associated with the atiyah-hitchin metric.
the uniformization of the algebraic curve (4.20) describing the ah space is also known
to be closely related to the continual 3d toda equation [18] that, in its turn, naturally
arises in the large n limit of 2d conformal eld theories [22].

it is also remarkable that the very simple (quartic) hyper-kahler potential (2.11)
provides the exhaustive description of the highly non-trivial (two-parameter) family
of hyper-kahler metrics generalizing the standard atiyah-hitchin metric, with both
n=2 supersymmetry and su(2) internal symmetry being manifest. the n=2 nlsm
in hss with atiyah-hitchin metric has a natural holomorphic projection dened in
n=2 pss, where it is associated with the holomorphic o(4) line bundle.

it should be possible to generalize some of the results given above to the case of
several hypermultiplets. the bare hypermultiplet masses described by n=2 central
charges also imply a nontrivial scalar potential in the atiyah-hitchin 4d, n=2 nlsm,
which may lead to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking [3].
