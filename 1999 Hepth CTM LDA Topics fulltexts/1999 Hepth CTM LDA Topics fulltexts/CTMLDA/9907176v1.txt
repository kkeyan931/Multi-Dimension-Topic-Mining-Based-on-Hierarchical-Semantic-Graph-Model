abstract

we investigate solutions to a nonlinear integral equation which has a central
role in implementing the non-abelian gausss law and in constructing gauge-
invariant quark and gluon elds. here we concern ourselves with solutions to
this same equation that are not operator-valued, but are functions of spatial
variables and carry spatial and su(2) indices. we obtain an expression for
the gauge-invariant gauge eld in two-color qcd, dene an index that we will
refer to as the winding number that characterizes it, and show that this
winding number is invariant to a small gauge transformation of the gauge
eld on which our construction of the gauge-invariant gauge eld is based.
we discuss the role of this gauge eld in determining the winding number of
the gauge-invariant gauge eld. we also show that when the winding number
of the gauge eld is an integer 6=0, the gauge-invariant gauge eld manifests
winding numbers that are not integers, and are half-integers only when  = 0.

i. introduction

in earlier work, in which we discussed qcd in the temporal (a

i = 0) gauge, [1] we
implemented the non-abelian gausss law and constructed quark and gluon operator-valued
elds that are invariant to small non-abelian gauge transformations. an essential element
in that program was a nonlocal operator, a
i (r), which we called the resolvent eld in
later publications. [2,3] the resolvent eld is a functional of the gauge eld a
i (r), and it
has a pivotal role in our work. it rst appears, in combination with 
i (r)  the canonical
momentum for the gauge eld and the negative chromoelectric eld  in the operator,

in subsequent work, [25] we used these gauge-invariant elds to derive an expression
for a nonlocal interaction that couples gauge-invariant quark color-charge densities to each
other and to gluons through chains, in which each link consists of an integral over the
gauge-invariant gluon eld. su(3) or su(2) structure constants connect the links to form
the chains. as was shown in ref. [1], the quantities that appear in this formulation  the

gauge-invariant quark color-charge density j
2 gi and the gauge-invariant gauge
eld a
gi i(r)  commute with the generator of innitesimal gauge transformations and
therefore are completely invariant to small gauge transformations. in the work presented
here, we will focus attention on the resolvent eld in two-color qcd. we will examine its
structure in conguration space and its role in determining the topological features of the
gauge-invariant gluon eld.

ii. configurations of the resolvent field

in ref. [1], we presented a nonlinear integral equation for the resolvent eld. although, in
ref. [1], our concern was with the series representation of the operator-valued resolvent eld,
it is also relevant to ask whether the integral equation for the resolvent eld has solutions
other than that series.
it is this question that we now consider. the most general form
of the integral equation for the resolvent eld, applicable to any su(n) gauge theory, is
not useful for this investigation; but its su(2) form, given in ref. [1], is very suitable for
our purposes. in the su(2) case, the integral equation for the resolvent eld a
i (r) can be
expressed in the following form:

a
i (r) = a

i (r)x + a

i (r)y ,

a
i (r)x = g x (r) a

we observe that the right-hand side of eq.(2.2) is independent of a

i (r) and on trigonometric functions of n , where

i (r) and depends only

n = hg2 x (r)x (r)i

(2.4)

a
i (r)x therefore is not responsible for any of the nonlinearity of the nonlinear integral equa-
tion shown in eq.(2.1), but represents an inhomogeneity in that equation. the right-hand
side of eq.(2.3), however, contains the resolvent eld a
i (r) and n as well as trigonometric
functions of n , where

n = hg2 y (r)y (r)i

eqs.(1.3) and (1.6) are identical in form to the equations describing the change in a spinor
eld and a gauge eld, respectively, produced by a nite non-abelian gauge transformation,
with the important exception that the transforming c-number gauge function in a gauge

transformation is replaced by the operator-valued gy (r) and gx (r) in vc(r). the su(2)
version of vc(r), given by

[vc(r)]su (2) = exp(cid:16) igy (r)  

2 (cid:17) exp(cid:16)igx (r)  

can be interpreted as a sequence of two rotations represented in the fundamental represen-
tation of su(2). in one of these rotations, gx (r)/n designates a direction about which the
rotation is made, and n the magnitude of the locally varying angle of rotation; a similar
correspondence applies to gy (r) and n in the other rotation. in this su(2) case, we can
also express [vc(r)]su (2) in the form

2 (cid:17) ,

(2.6)

[vc(r)]su (2) = exp(cid:16)igz (r)  
2 (cid:17)

(2.7)

where the composition laws for rotations enable us to express z (r) as a function of x (r)
and y (r), and both in terms of equivalent sets of locally varying euler angles, much as was
done by christ and lee. [6] because the algebra of su(n) generators is closed, the su(3)
2 (cid:17) , where the
form of vc(r) can also be expressed in the form vc(r) = exp(cid:16)igz (r) 
baker-hausdor-campbell theorem enables us to equate z  to a complicated expansion in
x  and y . the familiar group composition laws for rotations are a special case of the
baker-hausdor-campbell theorem applied to the su(2) case. eqs.(2.2) and (2.3) illustrate
this similarity in form of eqs.(1.3) and (1.6) to the equations that implement nite gauge
transformations. eq.(2.2) has the same form as a nite gauge transformation of a gauge eld
in the adjoint representation of su(2), with gx (r) serving as the function by which the eld
is gauge-transformed; the same applies to (2.3) with gy (r) in place of gx (r). such non-
abelian gauge congurations have well-documented important geometric and topological
implications for gauge theories. [710] the similarity in form of the equations that establish
gauge-invariant elds to those that eect gauge transformations accounts for the appearance
in our work of expressions that resemble the inverse of the faddeev popov operator i(aci +
gf cbaab
i ), which arises when transformations from the temporal to the coulomb gauge are
carried out by treating them as transformations from cartesian to curvilinear eld variables.
[6,11,12] in our work, i(aci + gf cbaab
gi i ) appears in place of the faddeev-popov operator,
and it appears in a representation in which the gauge eld ab
gi i and the quark color charge
0 = g(b/2) are gauge invariant and in which the temporal gauge condition
density jb
continues to apply, even though the gauge-invariant gauge eld (but not the gauge eld) is
transverse. [4,5]

in spite of this similarity in form of nite gauge transformations to eqs.(1.3) and (1.6), the
signicance of these two equations is very dierent from that of a nite gauge transformation.
in a gauge transformation, the gauge eld is transformed by an arbitrary c-number function
that bears no relationship to the original gauge eld. but in the case of eqs.(1.3) and
(1.6), x  and y  (as well as n and n ) are themselves functionals of the gauge eld, and
therefore are subject to the same gauge transformations that aect it. in fact, under the
innitesimal gauge transformation a
i (r)(r) , vc(r) transforms

i (r) = i(r) + ga

4

so that vc(r) = igvc(r)(r) 
2 . [13] instead of representing a gauge transformation,
eqs.(1.3) and (1.6) establish the operator-valued nonlocal quantities gi(r) and a
gi i(r),
which are entirely invariant to any further transformations eected by the generator of
gauge transformations

the integral equation described in eqs.(2.1)-(2.3) can be viewed in two distinct ways: on
the one hand, as was shown in ref. [1], eqs.(2.1)-(2.3) can be used to generate an operator-
valued series representation of the resolvent eld a
i (r), which is instrumental in establishing
gauge-invariant quark and gluon elds and quantum states that implement the non-abelian
gausss law. but, because all the operator-valued elds that appear in it commute with
each other (the only operator that would not commute with the quantities in eqs.(2.1)-
(2.3)  
i (r)  does not appear in any of these
equations), eq.(2.1) also can be treated as a non-linear integral equation whose solutions
can be investigated by more-or-less standard procedures.
in this second context, we can
view the resolvent eld a
i (r) as functions of spatial variables that
obey the same nonlinear integral equation as the corresponding operator-valued quantities.
we can, furthermore, make an ansatz about the functional dependence of a
i (r)
on spatial variables that is physically reasonable, and that facilitates the solution of the
nonlinear equation given in eqs.(2.1)-(2.3). the functional forms of a
i (r) will
represent number-valued realizations of these operator-valued elds, and will enable us to
investigate their spatial congurations and their topological features.

we will carry out this program by assuming that a

i (r) are functions of spatial
variables, that they are second-rank tensors in the combined spatial and su(2) indices i and
 respectively, and that, except in so far as the forms of a
i (r) must reect this
second-rank tensor structure, they are isotropic functions of the position. the most general
form of a

i (r) will therefore be

(2.22)

substitution of eqs.(2.19), (2.20), and (2.22) into eq.(2.1) enables us to express a and c
as functions of n , n , ta, and tc, so that we obtain
a =

and

c =

1

gr hn sin(n + n ) + cos(n + n )  1i + tc hcos(n + n )  1i + ta sin(n + n ) .

(2.24)

we can solve eqs.(2.12) and (2.21) simultaneously to eliminate b, and obtain a nonlin-
ear dierential equation that is equivalent to the nonlinear integral equation described in
eqs.(2.1)-(2.3) modulo the previously-mentioned assumptions about the forms of the re-
solvent eld and the gauge eld.
it is most convenient to use the dimensionless variable
u = ln(r/r0), where r0 is an arbitrary constant length, as the independent variable in ex-
pressing this dierential equation, which then is

(2.25)

eq.(2.25) is a nonlinear dierential equation in the variable n , which determines the resol-
vent eld. n , ta, and tc will be taken to be known functions in this equation. one question
of immediate interest is whether there are nonvanishing solutions for the case that n , ta,
and tc all vanish, so that the gauge eld a
in that case, eq.(2.25)
reduces to

is identically zero.

i

du  2sin(n ) = 0.

(2.26)

we observe that eq.(2.26) is the equation for a damped pendulum in which small-amplitude
oscillations have not been assumed, in which u corresponds to the time, and n =  + ,
where  = 0 when the pendulum is in its stable equilibrium position. moreover, eq.(2.26)
corresponds to the equation for the pendulum in which mass, length, local acceleration due
to gravity, and damping constant have been set = 1, so that no adjustable parameters remain
in the equation.

7

in discussing eqs.(2.25) and (2.26), we will assume that ta, tc, and n  2 (where  is
an integer), vanish faster than 1/r as r. moreover, we also assume that the gauge eld
is bounded everywhere, so that rta0 as r0, and that the same applies to rtc, and rn .
we will make these conditions more precise in the appendix.

the fact that eq.(2.26) describes a damped pendulum moving without a driving force
makes it obvious that it has nonvanishing solutions. in the limit u, the damped pen-
dulum must come to rest in a position of static equilibrium, so that, as u, nm,
where m is an arbitrary integer. physical considerations lead us to expect that the damped
pendulum will come to rest in a position of stable equilibrium, for which n(2m + 1).
but in the application of eq.(2.26) of interest to us in the current context, all possible so-
lutions  those that terminate at saddle points as well as those that terminate at stable
equilibrium positions  must be considered as long as they are bounded functions in the
interval  < u < . eq. (2.25) is more complicated than eq.(2.26); but as a result of the
conditions on ta, and tc, and on n for the  = 0 case, discussed above and made precise
in the appendix, eq. (2.25) approaches eq.(2.26) at the origin in conguration space, i. e.
in the limit u  , as well as in the limit u. it is therefore reasonable to expect that
nm as u even when it is governed by eq.(2.25). that this expectation is fullled,
is shown in the appendix. when 6=0, n still approaches a denite limit as u, but that
limit is no longer an integer multiple of . this case is discussed in section iii, and the
mathematical foundations for this discussion are given in the appendix.

it is possible to use the results obtained in this section, in particular eqs.(2.11), (2.16),

(2.23) and (2.24), to represent the gauge-invariant gauge eld as

and nd that

and

(xcos + y sin)  = 0

(xsin  y cos)  = 0 .

(2.43)

(2.44)

since x and y are determined by the initial conguration of the gauge eld a
i , which is
arbitrary, eqs.(2.43) and (2.44) must be satised without requiring that x and y vanish.
it therefore follows that  = 0, which, with eq.(2.36), leads to

and, with eq.(2.35), to the following dierential equation for the variation of n produced
by an innitesimal gauge transformation:

n = g,

n (r)  2n (r) = 2g2(r)rtc(r).

further conrmation of the consistency of these results is obtained by examining the varia-
tion of a
gi i(r) due to an innitesimal gauge transformation of the quantities that constitute
it. this variation is given by

the eect of small gauge transformations on the limits of n as u can best be ex-
plored by expressing eq.(2.46) in terms of the independent variable u. as is discussed in the
appendix, the expression rtc appearing on the right-hand-side of that equation is subject
to the conditions limu |r0 exp(u)tc(u)| < k exp(u) and limu |r0 exp(u)tc(u)| <
k  exp(u), where k and k  are constants. constraints can be placed on , but the only
one necessary to complete this argument is that  is bounded in the interval (, ).
these circumstances allow us to conclude that eq.(2.46) can be represented, in the limits
u and u  , in the form
d

lim

u|n (u)|  a exp(u) + bexp(2u)
(2.49)

for some constants a, b, a, and b. we observe that the limiting values of n (u), as
u, vanish, and that therefore the corresponding limiting values of n (u), as u and
as u, are invariant to small gauge transformations  i. e. transformations implemented
by i
2 (r) acting as the generator of innitesimal gauge
transformations. but n (u), for arbitrary values of u, does not share that invariance. these
arguments will be used, in the next section, to show that the winding number of the gauge-
invariant gauge eld remains unaected by small gauge transformations.

iii. topology and the implementation of gauge invariance

our considerations in this section are based on the fact, discussed in section ii, that

the transformation that converts the quark eld (r) and the gauge eld a

11

respective gauge-invariant forms  as shown in eqs.(1.3) and (1.6) respectively  has the
formal structure of a gauge transformation, although it diers from a gauge transformation
in a very important respect: the argument of the operator-valued vc(r) that eects the
transformation to gauge-invariant forms is not a function by which (r) and a
i (r) are gauge-
transformed, but is itself operator-valued and subject to gauge transformations. eqs.(1.3)
and (1.6) therefore actually represent transformations of gauge-dependent elds to forms that
are invariant to further gauge transformations. nevertheless, when we represent vc(r) as a
number-valued realization of the operator-valued quantity, we can use its formal structure
to investigate the topological features of the gauge-invariant gauge elds.

with the ansatz that led to the expression for the resolvent eld given in eq. (2.22), we

nd that vc(r) is given by

vc(r) = exp

irnn(cid:16)n + n(cid:17)

and that the expression for a

q = i(242)1ijkz drtr[a i(r)a j(r)a k(r)] ;

(3.7)

we will refer to q as the winding number of the gauge-invariant gauge eld, even though
its values are not restricted to integers. unlike the winding numbers of the gauge eld,
which are integer-valued, [710] q is determined by the properties of n , which is governed
by eq.(2.25) and by the fact that it must be bounded in the entire interval 0r < . in
discussing the properties of n , we extract the pure gauge part of the gauge eld

from eq.(2.18); we further observe that, in section ii and in the appendix, we have assumed
that n = 0 at r = 0, and that lim r n = 2, so that the winding number of the gauge
eld is the integer , and therefore that

q =

rhn (r)  sin(cid:16)n (r)(cid:17)i  n (0) + sin(cid:16)n (0)(cid:17)(cid:27) .

(3.9)

as is shown in the appendix, when  = 0 and n is normalized so that n = 0 when r = 0,
lim r n = m. for the  = 0 case, q is therefore given by

q =

(3.10)

where m is an integer. we will now discuss the implications of eq.(2.25) for the values of q
when 6=0.

when we consider gauge elds with winding numbers 6=0, for which limu n (u) = 2,
but limu exp(u)ta(u), and limu exp(u)tc(u) still vanish along with limu n (u),
limu exp(u)ta(u), and limu exp(u)tc(u), then we observe that, in the limit u,
n (u) satises

d2 n

(3.11)

and n (u) approaches a limiting value limu n (u), which exists, but is not an integer mul-
tiple of . n (u) vanishes, as before, at the saddle point for which u, but limu n (u)
now is one of the denumerably innite solutions of the transcendental equation

tan(cid:26) lim

un (u)(cid:27) = 2 .

(3.12)

if we adopt the convention that the inverse tangent is dened so that, for  = tan1(),
 
2 <  < 

2 , then the winding numbers for the gauge-invariant gauge eld are given by

q =

2  tan1(2) + m

(3.13)

for some integer m.

eq.(3.13) establishes a winding number for the gauge-invariant gauge eld that is a
function of two integer-valued variables,  and m, but that is not itself integer-valued. the
integer  denes the homotopy class of the gauge eld on which the construction of the
gauge-invariant gauge eld is based. gauge-invariant gauge elds can be categorized by the
value of  that describes the homotopy class of the gauge elds to which they are linked by
eq.(2.25), and by the value of m that denes the sheet on which the inverse tangent function
that corresponds to the limu n (u) is located. the range of values of the integer m, for
which m corresponds to limits that n (u) can actually attain, depends on the solutions
of eq.(2.25) that given sets of functions n (u), ta(u) and tc(u) can support. examples of
solutions, and their implications for winding numbers of the gauge-invariant gauge eld, are
given in section iv.

the relationship between q,  and m reects the fact that, when limu n (u) = 0, the
lim u n (u) is the only part of the gauge eld that can aect its homotopy class; however,
the functional dependence of n (u), ta(u) and tc(u) for the entire range of values of u aects
the lim u n (u), and therefore q, as shown in eqs.(2.25) and (3.9). a number of dierent
values of m can therefore be compatible with the same , and, in fact, with the identical
functions n (u), ta(u) and tc(u). the mathematical foundations for these observations are
discussed in section iv and in the appendix.

iv. illustrative numerical examples

in this section, we present illustrative examples of numerical integrations of eq.(2.25)
that simulate solutions that are bounded for all real values of the independent variable.2 in
carrying out these numerical integrations, we have selected functional forms for ta, tc, and
n that are consistent with assumptions (a1) to (a3) and that include examples of n that
belong to the trivial homotopy class with  = 0, as well as others in which limt n = 2
with 6=0. the technical considerations on which these simulations are based, and the
individual examples, constitute the remainder of this section

in theorem 1 in the appendix, we have established the existence of a solution n sat-
isfying equation (a4) and boundary conditions (a5), provided assumptions (a1) to (a3)
are satised. (it is noted that w and y in the appendix represent n and n , respectively.)
such assumptions essentially say that etta and ettc behave like 0 for large |t|, and that n
behaves like 0 as t  , and like 2 for some integer , as t  .

remark 3 in theorem 1 asserts that there are an innite number of solutions to eq.(a4).
but the question arises: will numerical solutions of eq.(a4), that are bounded in the entire

2in this section, and in the appendix, eq.(2.25) will sometimes be written in the form of eq.(a4),
and the independent variable u will sometimes be written as t.

14

interval (,) and normalized so that limt n = 0, always settle down to the same
two values of m as in the case for the damped pendulum? (it is well known, in the case of
eq.(2.26) which describes a damped pendulum, that there are exactly two classes of solutions
 one for m = 1 and another for m = 1.) we will carry out some numerical experiments
to address this question, and document some of our results in this section.

since our numerical computations will be done on a nite interval [m, m] for some
large value m > 0, we will rst construct the appropriate boundary condition at t = m.
with the solution n going to zero as t  , one can impose the boundary condition
n (m) = 0. however, a better boundary condition can be constructed, which leads to
reduced numerical errors even when we use only a moderate value of m. this reduced
interval size for [m, m] leads to more ecient and more accurate calculations. such
attributes of numerical innity are well known (see chapter 4, ref. [16]).

since both n and n tend to zero as t approaches , we employ a taylors expansion
to extract the leading order behavior of the terms in equation (a4) in that regime. we keep
only the leading order terms in n and n , taking into account that while both are small
when t  , the relative magnitudes of n and n are not known. in this way, we nd
that

n cos(n + n )  sin(n + n )  n  n 3/3 .
hence from (a4), we expect that eq.(2.25) is well approximated by

n  + n   2n  2n 3/3  ettan 2/2  ettcn  0 .

(4.1)

(4.2)

where  designates dierentiation with respect to t. the relative magnitudes of the three
source terms containing n in the above equation as t  , will determine which one will
dominate over the others. assuming that the dominant behavior of these three source terms
is et for some constants  and  > 0 as t approaches , we can further simplify eq.(4.2)
and obtain the following linear non-homogeneous equation with constant coecients:

n  + n   2n + et  0 .

(4.3)

if we had exact equality in the above equation, the complementary solutions would be
spanned by e2t and et. a particular solution of such an equation would be of the form
1et, for some constant 1. since n is bounded as t  , we expect solutions for large
negative t to be of the form

n  cet + 1et

(4.4)

for some constant c. the following two sets of circumstances may apply:

case i:  > 1.
in order to avoid the unbounded complementary solution e2t,
in this case, n  cet.
we will employ the boundary condition n (m) = n (m). we can assign an arbitrary
value, , to both n and to n 
at t = m, so long as m is suciently large and || is
suciently small. thus we can employ a standard initial value problem-solver (like runge

15

kunta method with local error control, as can be found in any standard software) to solve
equation (a4), and integrate eq.(2.25) from t = m to a large positive value of t. we can
also integrate backwards from t = m to a negative value of t whose absolute value is even
larger than m.

case ii:  < 1.
n  cet. in order to avoid the unbounded complementary solution e2t in this case, we
would have to employ the boundary condition n (m) = n (m).
in all the numerical experiments presented in the following illustrative examples, the domi-
nant behavior as t  is that of the complementary solution et, so that all our examples
belong to case i. we therefore impose the initial conditions n (m) = n (m) = , for
some large m > 0 and small || in these experiments. provided such conditions are met,
when we integrate equation (a4) backward in t towards , numerical solutions of n stay
close to the value 0 for a long interval. this will be clearly seen in fig. 1 to fig. 6 below.
since we also have an unbounded mode e2t near t = , n = 0 acts like a saddle point.
hence if we continue to integrate backward in time, the numerical solution will eventually
blow up, as one can never get rid of the unbounded mode entirely in numerical calcula-
tions, even though theorem 1 demonstrates that solutions exist that never deviate from 0
as t  .

should we use conditions other than n (m) = n (m), the magnitude of the solutions
will become large very quickly as we integrate backward in the variable t. a larger value of
m is needed to ensure that condition (a5a) is satised approximately in such a scenario.
this larger domain will increase the computational cost and decrease the accuracy of the
simulation results.

from the proof of theorem 1, we know that for any value of  and m, a solution n
will settle down to a value as depicted by condition (a5b). hence we expect that there are
innitely many solutions to eq.(a4) satisfying boundary conditions (a5). but the existence
of an innity of solutions does not imply that there are innitely many m values that
these solutions approach as t. we have carried out numerous numerical experiments
to address this question. these experiments show that solutions of eq.(a4) exist, for the
identical ta, tc, and n , for which limt n = 0, which demonstrate that n approaches
limits corresponding to at least three dierent values of m as t. we will document some
of the more interesting numerical results below:

a. experiment 1

in this experiment we have used

n =

10et

(1 + e2t)2 and ta = tc = t3 exp(3t2)(cid:16)1  exp(6t2)(cid:17)

with  = 2gr0 = 250, where we have taken m as the value of negative numerical innity
with m = 13.03423. we have set n = n 
= 106 at t = m. the result, using a standard

16

initial value problem-solver, is represented in figure 1. we observe that n is essentially
zero from about t = 5 to t = 25 ( |n (25)|105), that it hovers near the unstable
equilibrium position n = 6 to within better than 1 part per 105 at t = 10, and stabilizes
to its nal position at n = 7. with reference to eq.(3.13),  = 0 and m = 7. the winding
number for the gauge-invariant gauge eld in this numerical experiment is q = 7
2.

b. experiment 2

we employ exactly the same data here as in experiment 1, except that in our choice of
numerical innity m in this experiment, m = 13.034; and that we have set n = n 
=
106 at t = m. the result is represented in figure 2. we observe in this case that n
is again essentially zero from about t = 5 to t = 25 ( |n (25)|105), that it briey
hovers near the unstable equilibrium position n = 6 in the vicinity of t = 8, and stabilizes
to its nal position at n = 5. with reference to eq.(3.13),  = 0 and m = 5. the winding
number for the gauge-invariant gauge eld in this numerical experiment is q = 5
2.

c. experiment 3

we again employ exactly the same data here as in experiments 1 and 2, except that in our
= 106
choice of numerical innity m in this case m = 30, and that we have set n = n
at t = m. the result is represented in figure 3. we observe in this case that n is again
essentially zero from about t = 5 to t = 25 ( |n (40)| < 21010), that it remains
within approximately 1% of  in the vicinity of t = 9, and that it stabilizes to its nal
position at n = 9. with reference to eq.(3.13),  = 0 and m = 9. the winding number
for the gauge-invariant gauge eld in this numerical experiment is q = 9
2.



d. experiment 4

in this experiment we have used

n =

100et

(1 + e2t)2 +(cid:18)1 

1

1 + et(cid:19) 2 and ta = tc = t3 exp(3t2)(cid:16)1  exp(6t2)(cid:17)



with  = 2gr0 = 250, and we have taken m as the value of negative numerical innity,
= 104 at t = m. the result is represented in figure
with m = 20. we have set n = n
4. we observe that n is essentially zero from about t = 12 to t = 30 ( |n (30)|105);
that it briey hovers near n =  from approximately t = 8 to t = 6 to within about
.2%, and that it stabilizes to its nal position at n = 29.6874. since tan1(2) = 1.41297,
and 29.6874  1.41297 = 28.2744 = 9, this experiment exemplies an  = 1 and m = 9
case. the winding number for the gauge-invariant gauge eld in this numerical experiment
is q = 4.5677.

17

e. experiment 5

we employ exactly the same data here as in experiment 4, but choose m = 15. in this
experiment, we have set n = n 
= 104 at t = m. the result is represented in figure
5. we observe in this case that |n (25)|105, and that it stabilizes to its nal position
at n = 17.1214. since tan1(2) = 1.41297, and 17.1214  1.41297 = 15.7084 = 5, this
experiment exemplies an  = 1 and m = 5 case. the winding number for the gauge-
invariant gauge eld in this numerical experiment is q = 2.5677.

f. experiment 6

we employ exactly the same data here as in experiments 4 and 5, but choose m = 30.
in this experiment, we have set n = n 
= 104 at t = m. the result is represented in
figure 6. we observe in this case that |n (35)|106, that it hovers near n =  from
approximately t = 17 to t = 6 to about 3% and that it stabilizes to its nal position
at n = 35.9699. since tan1(2) = 1.41297, and 35.9699  1.41297 = 34.557 = 11, this
experiment exemplies an  = 1 and m = 11 case. the winding number for the gauge-
invariant gauge eld in this numerical experiment is q = 5.5677.

g. comments on numerical experiments

we note that in all six experiments, we were able to calculate backward in t from t = m
for a long range, and still could obtain small values of n . this shows that our choice of
initial conditions n (m) = n (m) has been eective and reliable.

with reference to theorem 1, we note that in experiments 1, 2 and 3, the given n leads
to  = 0 for the limit specied in assumption a2; similarly, in experiments 4, 5 and 6, the
given n leads to  = 1. hence, for large t, in experiments 1,2 and 3, n converges to m
for some integer m, and, in experiments 4, 5 and 6, n converges to tan1(2) + m for
some integer m, in accordance with remark 2 in the appendix. we observe that for each
of two values of , m is a dierent integer in each experiment. thus the numerical results
show that there are cases in which, for the same n , ta, and tc, n can converge to at least
three dierent values of m.

a linearization analysis shows that if m is odd, then m behaves like a stable equilibrium
point. however, when m is even, m acts like a saddle point. (that is why we have a saddle
point behavior at t = , since it corresponds to m = 0, which is even.) a good analogy
can again be made to the damped pendulum case. the even values of m correspond to an
inverted pendulum whose equilibrium is unstable, while the odd values correspond to the
lowest stable equilibrium point. while it is theoretically possible for a moving pendulum to
stop exactly at the inverted position, any slight error will prevent us from observing such a
phenomenon in numerical calculations. (this is equivalent to observing that we can never
completely eliminate the unbounded mode in numerical calculations.) however, in principle,

18

there is no reason why n cannot approach an unstable limit point at which m is even, as
t. in fact, experiments 1 and 2 substantiate this claim, since the solutions n hover
near 6 for such an extended interval. it is not surprising to nd that the precise values of
initial conditions that bring about the transition from 5 to 7 are sensitive to the numerical
accuracy of the computation. in experiments 1 and 2, a change in the numerical accuracy
of the computation can require a 1% change in the value of m to obtain similar qualitative
results.

in section iii, the discussion is based on the properties of the solutions of eq.(2.25).
the theorem that establishes these solutions is proven in this appendix. in this proof, the
function n and n are represented as y and w respectively, and the independent variable u
is represented as t.

let ta, tc, and w be given c 1 (continuously dierentiable) functions of t in the interval
(,), let  be a given positive constant, and let  be a given integer. we assume that
there is a positive constant  such that

we have the following theorem.

theorem 1 under the assumptions (a1) to (a3) on w, ta and tc stated above, there is a
solution y to equation (a4) on the interval (,). moreover,

y(t) = tan1 (2) + m ,

2(cid:17).
where n and m are integers and tan1 : r(cid:16) 
2 , 
remark 1: by using the substitution y = y  2n, it suces to prove the above theorem
when n = 0.
remark 2: when  = 0, then equation (a5b) yields limt y(t) = m for some integer m.
when 6=0, then equation (a5b) yields limt y(t) = tan1(2) + m for some integer m.
remark 3: actually the proof shows that there are an innite number of solutions to our
problem.

proof: because of the remark 1, we let n = 0. as t  , we expect that the contribu-
tions from the w, ta and tc terms are negligible due to the assumptions (a1), so that y = 0
behaves exactly like the unstable equilibrium point in the damped pendulum case. we now
prove that this intuition is indeed what happens.

we rewrite the equation as

where

y + y  2y + f (t, y) = 0 ,

f (t, y)  2{(y  sin(y + w)) + w cos(y + w)} + et {ta(cos(y + w)  1)  tc sin(y + w)} .
it is noted that |f (t, 0)|  o(1) et and fy(t, y) = o(1), when t is large and negative and |y|
is suciently small. next we convert it to a system of two equations,

y = z ,

z = z + 2y  f (t, y) .

if, besides the conditions that f satises, f (t, 0) also were 0 for all t, a standard theorem in
ordinary dierential equations (theorem 4.1, p.330, ref. [14] ) would enable us to conclude
that, for any negative t0 with suciently large modulus, there is a one dimensional manifold
s, which depends on t0, in the phase space (y, y), such that if the initial conditions y(t0)
and y(t0) lie on s, then y  0 as t  . in our case, we have |f (t, 0)|  o(1) et for
large and negative t. the same proof given in theorem 4.1 in ref. [14] still works. the
only alteration needed is in the rst step, when we iterate eq. (4.11) in that theorem, since
f (t, 0) is not zero anymore. however, because of the exponential decay of f (t, 0) for large
negative t, eq. (4.12) in that proof in ref. [14] will still be valid, and the same proof stands.
fix t0. we have thus constructed a solution y to equation (a4) on the interval (, t0]
satisfying (a5a). (because of the one dimensional manifold s, this gives rise to remark 3.)

take any m > 0. on any xed bounded interval [t0, m],

|2 {w cos(y + w)  sin(y + w)} + et {ta(cos(y + w)  1)  tc sin(y + w)}|

is uniformly bounded for all y. thus the solution y can never blow up in nite time, and
exists for all t  (,).

to nish the proof of this theorem, it suces to show that the solution has property
(a5b). for  = 0, we expect that this is the case physically, because for large t our equation
behaves like a damped pendulum moving under the inuence of gravity only  because
of assumptions (a2) and (a3)  hence we expect that the solution will settle down in an
equilibrium point, i.e. y = m for some integer m. to prove the property (a5b) for arbitrary
integer values of , take t1 > 0 suciently large so that for t  t1, w  et, et|ta|  et/2,
and et|tc|  et/2. now for t  t1, using the cauchy-schwarzs inequality,

for some constant c > 0. in other words, if we dene h  (y)2

, then

(a6)

hence h is decreasing in t for t  t1, and h  22kwk. since (y(t))2
2  h(t1)+2+2kwk
for t  t1, |y| is bounded for t  [t1,). from the governing equation (a4), |y| is then
bounded for t  [t1,).

next take the derivate of the equation (a4). from this equation, we have |y| is bounded
for t  [t1,) due to assumptions (a3). we can now conclude that both |h | and |h | are
bounded for t  [t1,) by some simple calculations.

since h is monotone decreasing and has a lower bound, there exists a constant h0 such
that limt h = h0. together with the bound on |h |, we can conclude (p.116, ref. [15])
that limt h  = 0. it can be checked that

dh

dt = (y)2   exp(t){ta(cos(y + w)  1)  tc sin(y + w)} y

+2ww cos(y + w)  8(2 + c)et .

taking the limit as t  , we have

(y)2 = 0 ,

lim
t

(a7)

(a8)

which means y  0 as t  . together with |y| being bounded, this yields limt y = 0
(by the same theorem in ref. [15]). finally, taking the limit t   in equation (a4), we
obtain the result

lim
t

(w cos(y + w)  sin(y + w)) = 0 .

(a9)

this can be reduced to limt[2 cos y sin y] = 0. this is equivalent to (a5b). the proof
of the theorem is now complete.
