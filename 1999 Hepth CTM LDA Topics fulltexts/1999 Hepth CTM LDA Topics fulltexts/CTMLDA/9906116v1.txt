abstract

the origin of the rather mysterious duality symmetry found in quantum liouville

theory is investigated by considering the liouville theory as the reduction of a wzw-like

theory in which the form of the potential for the cartan eld is not xed a priori. it is

shown that in the classical theory conformal invariance places no condition on the form

of the potential, but the conformal invariance of the classical reduction requires that it

be an exponential. in contrast, the quantum theory requires that, even before reduction,

the potential be a sum of two exponentials. the duality of these two exponentials is

the fore-runner of the liouville duality. an interpretation for the reection symmetry

found in quantum liouville theory is also obtained along similar lines.

a single real scalar eld governed by the so-called liouville action [1] plays a

ubiquitous role in the study of two-dimensional conformal and integrable eld theories,

and is of considerable importance in the context of quantum gravity and string theory

[2]. amongst its many unusual properties is a particularly intriguing one, namely,

the invariance of the quantum theory under a duality symmetry which is absent in

the classical theory. this duality symmetry is responsible for the doubling of a one-

dimensional lattice of poles (in the parameter space) of the coecient of the three-point

function of vertex operators, as explained in detail in [3]. it was also shown there that the

three-point function, with the correct pole structure, may be derived by incorporating

the duality into the denition of the path integral for the liouville theory on a sphere.

as is well-known, the classical liouville theory may be obtained by imposing a

set of linear rst class constraints on the currents of an sl(2, r) wess-zumino-witten

(wzw) model [4]. in the present paper, we investigate the origin of the liouville duality

by considering the liouville theory as the reduction of a wzw-like theory in which the

form of the potential for the cartan eld is not xed a priori. it will be shown that

the conformal invariance of the classical reduction forces this theory to be the sl(2, r)

wzw model, but an essential dierence between the classical and quantum reductions

lies at the heart of the duality symmetry of the quantum liouville theory.

the wzw-like theory we start with is dened by the following action:

s = kz d2xg [

1
2

g()( ) + g(a)(c)v ()]

(1)

in the above equation, , a and c are real scalar elds and v () is an arbitrary function

of . obviously, (1) describes a conformally invariant model at the classical level. upon
the addition of a topological term ik (a)(c)v (), the action becomes

s = kz d2z [

1
2

( )() + ( a)(c)v ()]

(2)

where we have used complex coordinates z = x0+ix1
in terms of which
 = 0  i1,  = 0 + i1 and d2z = 2idzdz. note that choosing the topological

, z = x0ix1

term with the opposite sign would have resulted in    in (2). the classical energy-
momentum tensor, t    1g

, is given by

s

t  =

2

()() + (a)(c)v ()]

(3)

as usual, it is traceless, symmetric, and conserved, and does not receive any contribution

from the topological term as the latter is independent of the metric.

note that for v () = e, eq. (2) simplies to the sl(2, r) wzw action, with

a and c locally parametrising the nilpotent subgroups, and  the abelian subgroup,

respectively, in a gauss decomposition of the group-valued wzw eld. in the following,

however, we shall allow v () to be arbitrary to begin with, and examine the restrictions

imposed on its form, by requiring the action (2) to be amenable to a conformally

invariant reduction. it will be shown that for this requirement to be satised, v () is

governed by a second order functional dierential equation whose two solutions are dual

to each other. in the classical limit only one of the two solutions of this equation has

a non-trivial (-dependent) value which corresponds to the standard sl(2, r) wzw

case.

we shall rst present the analysis of conformal invariance in the classical case. the

expressions for the momenta  conjugate to the elds , a, c follow from the action

(2) and are given by

 = k ,

a = kv ()c,

and c = kv () a

(4)

the non-vanishing poisson brackets, evaluated at equal time, are given by

{(x, t), (y, t)} = {a(x, t), a(y, t)} = {c(x, t), c(y, t)} = (x  y)

(5)

the virasoro generator t is given by

t = z dz (z)[

k
2

()2  kacv 1 + 2ia(1a)](z)

(6)

3

the other virasoro generator t , may be obtained by making the exchanges a  c,  
,   . as usual, the poisson bracket of the two virasoros vanishes, and it suces to
focus our attention on one virasoro.

the conformal transformation of a eld o, generated by t, is given by o 

{t, o}. hence the elds have the following conformal variations:

a = a,

c = c,

 = ,

v () = v ()

a = a + ()a,

c = 0

(7)

(8)

the momentum  does not transform like a conformal primary eld:

 =  + ()

k
2



this is expected because  = (k ) is a mixture of  and  derivatives of a scalar eld.

as can be seen from the following equation, however,  transforms like a conformal

primary eld:

it is also easy to check that

 =  + ()

t = t + 2()t

(9)

(10)

it follows from the above equations that classically a, c, , c have conformal weights

zero; a,  have weights one, and t has a weight two  as expected. the weights with

respect to the other virasoro are given by the same numbers if the exchanges a  c,
  , and    are done.

at this juncture it is worth noting that the virasoro (6) is unique if we insist on

keeping v () arbitrary. however, if we are interested in a special class of theories for

which v is restricted to be of the form

v = e

4

(11)

the virasoro is no longer unique.* this is because it is not necessary that a and

c should have conformal weights (1,0) and (0,1) respectively, for the action (2) to

be conformally invariant; it is only necessary that the combination acv 1() has a

weight (1,1). this freedom is expressible in terms of improvement terms which, when

added to the standard virasoro (6), redistribute the weights of the various elds in a way

which preserves the weight of the above combination of the elds. it is straightforward

to see that the improvement term t, for the virasoro t , is given by

t = z dz ()[k  aa](z)

(12)

where  is an arbitrary parameter. clearly, with respect to the full virasoro t + t, a

behaves like a primary eld of weight (1 + , 0). it is also easy to see that the eld

e transforms as follows under the action of the full virasoro t + t:

e = ()e + e

(13)

thus the combination acv 1 has weight one with respect to the full virasoro t + t.

note that the ratio of the coecients of the two terms in (12) is xed by the parameter

 in the potential.

it is straightforward to see that this ratio is also equal to the

corresponding ratio in the improvement terms t for the other virasoro t . further,

the requirement that the poisson bracket of the two virasoros is zero implies that the

improvement terms t and t have the same overall coecient  relative to t and t . it

may also be noted that for the theory to remain conformally invariant, it is not possible

to have only  to be zero. if  is zero, then  has to be necessarily zero.

it is worth mentioning that there is a good reason for considering the improved

virasoro t + t, and the concomitant freedom in redistributing the weights of the various

elds in the theory, namely, that it is necessary for the conformal reduction of the sl(2,

* note that by scaling the elds , a, and c, appropriately, (2) can be seen to

represent the sl(2, r) wzw model for this choice of v .

r) wzw theory to the liouville theory. the constraints that accomplish this reduction

are

a = ma

and c = mc

(14)

where ma and mc are constants. note that unless the improvement terms are present

with  = 1, it is not possible to impose the above constraints in a conformally
invariant manner since a and c have non-zero conformal dimensions. thus one is

forced to use the full virasoro t + t with  = 1. indeed, the improvement term with
 = 1 automatically provides the usual improvement terms of the liouville theory
upon reduction. having thus motivated the need for the improvement terms, it may be

noted that the argument can be reversed: given the full virasoro t + t and the action

(2), conformal invariance requires v to be of the form (11).

the situation in the quantum theory is remarkably dierent from that in the clas-

sical theory. the entire analysis leading up to eq.

(10) can be carried over to the

quantum theory in a relatively straightforward way by replacing poisson brackets with

commutators and the appropriate factors of ih, as long as care is exercised in taking the

ordering of the operators. the commutator of a with the virasoro can be calculated

without ado as the virasoro is linear in a, the conjugate eld. as expected, a remains

a conformal primary eld of weight (1, 0). the commutator of v 1 with the virasoro

is trickier because t is quadratic in . a short calculation shows that

v 1  [t, v 1] = ()(cid:16)ih2

2k

2v 1

2 (cid:17) + ih(v 1)

(15)

where we have used (z  z) = i[(z  z)]2 [5]. thus, at the quantum mechanical
level, v 1 ceases to behave like a conformal scalar for general v , with respect to t.

however, as in the classical case, if one adds improvement terms, it is sucient to

require that the combination acv 1() has a weight (1,1). it is easy to check then

that with respect to the full virasoro t + t, a behaves like a primary eld of weight

(1 + , 0) even at the quantum level. the conformal variation of v 1 with respect to

6

the full quantum virasoro is

v 1  [t + t, v 1] = ()(cid:16)ih2

2k

2v 1
2 + ih

v 1

 (cid:17) + ih(v 1)

(16)

the necessary condition for v 1 to have the correct conformal properties, can be read

o from the above equation to be

h

2v 1
2 +

v 1



= v 1

(17)

note that the above equation is a quadratic equation and has two solutions while its

classical counterpart obtained by setting h = 0 is a rst order equation which leads to

v = e. thus the quantum theory is slightly less stringent about the form of v , than

the classical theory, with respect to the demands imposed by conformal invariance. the

general solution for v 1 takes the form

where

v 1 = e+ + e

 =

k
h 

k

h r1 +

(18)

(19)

and  is a constant. note that + =  2k
h  showing that the two solutions are
dual to each other. also note that in the classical limit, h  0, +   and  
. in this limit the duality disappears and only (11) survives.

in passing we mention that the above results can be readily applied to work out the

transformation properties of the vertex operators u () = e2 of the eld . it follows

from eq. (16) that

(e2)  [t + t, e2] = ()(ih)(cid:16) 2

k

(k  h)(cid:17)e2 + ih(e2)

thus the conformal weight of the vertex operator is given by

(e2) =

(k  h)

2
k

7

(20)

(21)

which is manifestly symmetric under the exchange   k   in units of h = 1. this
is the reection symmetry of the conformal weight of a vertex operator in the quantum

theory.

substituting the solution for v from eqs. (18) and (19) in eq. (2), we have

s = z d2z [

1
2

( )() + ( a)(c)(e+ + e)1]

(22)

what we have shown is that the above highly non-linear action is conformally invariant

with respect to the full virasoro t +t in the quantum theory, and reduces to the standard

sl(2, r) wzw case in the classical limit. it easily follows that the constraints (14)

reduce (22) to

s = z d2z [

1
2

( )() + mamc(e+ + e)]

(23)

this is precisely the theory proposed in [3] to explain the duality symmetry of quantum

liouville theory and the pole structure of its three-point function.

to summarise the results of this paper, we have shown how the duality symmetry

that appears rather mysteriously in quantum liouville theory may be interpreted as a

reduced symmetry. thus the origin of this symmetry can be traced to the fact that

the conditions imposed by conformal invariance on the structure of the potential in the

liouville theory are dierent in the classical and quantum reductions, the latter being

less stringent than the former. this is because the h-dependent operator ordering ef-

fects in quantum theory produce a second order functional dierential equation for the

potential, whose solutions are dual to each other, while the absence of such eects in

the classical theory produces a rst order functional dierential equation whose unique

solution does not allow for the possibility of a duality symmetry. a natural interpreta-

tion for the reection symmetry in quantum liouville theory was also obtained along

these lines. it would be interesting to see if the results of this paper can be generalised

to discuss the duality and reection invariance of toda theories as reduced symmetries.
