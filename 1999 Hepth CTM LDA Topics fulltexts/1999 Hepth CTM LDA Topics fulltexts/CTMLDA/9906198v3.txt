we present a strong evidence for the magnetic condensation in qcd by demonstrating that the
magnitude of the magnetic eld strength of the monopole potential acquires a non-vanishing vacuum
expectation value through the quantum correction, which could induce the dual meissner eect and
guarantee the connement of color in the non-abelian gauge theory. the result is obtained by
separating the topological degrees which describes the non-abelian monopoles from the dynamical
degrees of the potential, and integrating out all the dynamical degrees of qcd.

one of the most outstanding problems in theoretical
physics is the connement problem in qcd. it has long
been argued that the monopole condensation could ex-
plain the connement of color through the dual meissner
eect [1,2].
indeed, if one assumes the monopole con-
densation, one could easily argue that the ensuing dual
meissner eect guarantees the connement [3,4]. but so
far there has not been a satisfactory proof how the desired
monopole condensation could take place in qcd. in this
direction, however, there has been a remarkable progress
in the lattice simulation during the last decade. in fact
the recent numerical simulation has provided an unmis-
takable evidence which supports the idea of the magnetic
connement through the monopole condensation [5,6].
the purpose of this letter is to establish the magnetic
condensation in qcd from the rst principles. utilizing
the parameterization of the gauge potential which empha-
sizes its topological character we establish the magnetic
condensation of vacuum in qcd in one loop approxi-
mation, after integrating out all the dynamical degrees
of the non-abelian potential. the result conrms that
the vacuum condensation naturally generates the mass
gap necessary for the dual meissner eect. this demon-
strates the existence of a dynamical symmetry breaking
mechanism which establishes the magnetic connement
in qcd. furthermore our result proves the conjecture
that the faddeev-skyrme type non-linear sigma model
can describe the eective theory of qcd in the low en-
ergy limit [2,7].

to prove the magnetic connement it is instructive
for us to remember how the magnetic ux is conned
in the superconductor through the meissner eect.
in
the ginzburg-landau description of super conductivity
the meissner eect is triggered by the mass term of the
electromagnetic potential, which determines the penetra-
tion (connement) scale of the magnetic ux.
in the
microscopic bcs description, this eective mass is gen-
erated by the electron-pair (the cooper pair) condensa-

tion. this suggests that, for the connement of the color
electric ux, one need the condensation of the monopoles.
equivalently, in the dual ginzburg-landau description,
one need the dynamical generation of the eective mass
for the monopole potential. to demonstrate this one
must rst identify the monopole potential, and separate
it from the generic qcd connection, in a gauge inde-
pendent manner. this can be done with the abelian
projection [2,3], which provides us a natural reparame-
terization of the non-abelian connection in terms of the
dual potential of the maximal abelian subgroup h of
the gauge group g and the gauge covariant vector eld
of the remaining g/h degrees. with this separation one
can show that the monopole condensation takes place af-
ter one integrates out all the dynamical degrees of the
non-abelian gauge potential. this strongly endorses the
magnetic connement in qcd.

consider su (2) for simplicity. a natural way to iden-
tify the monopole potential is to introduce an isotriplet
unit vector eld n which selects the abelian direction
at each space-time point, and to decompose the connec-
tion into the abelian part which leaves n invariant and
the remaining part which forms a covariant vector eld
[2,3],

~a = a n

g

n  n + ~x = a + ~x,

(n2 = 1, n  ~x = 0),

(1)

where a = n  ~a is the electric potential. notice
that the abelian projection a is precisely the connection
which leaves n invariant under the parallel transport,

d n =  n + g a  n = 0.

under the innitesimal gauge transformation

vector eld (the valence gluons) as its source [2,3]. ob-
viously the theory is invariant under the gauge transfor-
mation (3) of the active type. but notice that it is also
invariant under the following gauge transformation of the
passive type,

(4)

notice that a still describes an su (2) connection which
enjoys the full su (2) gauge degrees of freedom. more
importantly, a retains the full topological characteris-
tics of the original non-abelian potential. clearly the
isolated singularities of n denes 2(s 2) which describes
the non-abelian monopoles. indeed a with a = 0 and
n = r describes precisely the wu-yang monopole [8,9].
besides, with the s 3 compactication of r3, n character-
izes the hopf invariant 3(s 2)  3(s 3) which describes
the topologically distinct vacuua [10,11].

the above discussion tells that a has a dual struc-
ture. indeed the eld strength made of the abelian pro-
jection is decomposed as

f = (f + h)n,
f = a   a,
h = 

1
g

n  ( n   n) =  c   c,

(5)

where c is the magnetic potential [2,3]. so one can
identify the non-abelian monopole potential by

~c = 

1
g

n   n,

in terms of which the magnetic eld is expressed by
~h =  ~c   ~c + g ~c  ~c = g ~c  ~c

= h n.

(6)

(7)

notice that the magnetic eld has a remarkable structure

hhh =

which will be very useful for us in the following.

with (1) one has
~f = f + d ~x  d ~x + g ~x  ~x,

so that the yang-mills lagrangian is expressed as

 ~c = 0,

(11)

(12)

this gauge invariance of the passive type will be useful
in the following.

with this preparation we will now show that the eec-
tive theory of qcd, which one obtains after integrating
out all the dynamical degrees, can be written in one loop
approximation as

where h = q ~h 2

a nite constant. this is our main result, which provides
the desired magnetic condensation of the vacuum.

to derive the eective action consider the generating

functional of (10)

w [j, ~j] = z dad ~x exp[iz (

(14)

we have to perform the functional integral with a proper
choice of a gauge, leaving ~c as a background. to do
this we rst x the gauge with the condition

~f = d(a n + ~x) = 0

lgf =

2 h(a)2 + ( d ~x)2i ,

(15)

where d is dened with only ~c. so with (11) the
generating functional takes the form,

(10)

this shows that the yang-mills theory can be viewed as

the vacuum generates an eective mass for ~c,

(24)

(25)

where ~c and ~c  are the ghost elds. in one loop approx-
imation the a integration becomes trivial, and the ~x
and ghost integrations result in the following functional

with this the one loop contribution from the functional
integral to the eective lagrangian can be written as

l = i ln det( d+ d+ + 2gh)( d d 
where now d acquires the following abelian form,

2gh),

(19)

d =   ig c.

notice that the reason for this simplication is precisely
because ~c originates from the abelian projection. with
this one can use the heat kernel method and the zeta
function regularization to calculate the functional deter-
minant. for the covariantly constant ~h we nd

l =

which demonstrates that the magnetic condensation in-
deed generates the mass gap necessary for the dual meiss-
ner eect. obviously the mass scale sets the connement
scale.

to check the consistency of our result with the pertur-
bative qcd we now discuss the running coupling and the
renormalization. for this we dene the running coupling
g by

h 2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h= h

(26)

(27)

which exactly coincides with the well-known result [12].
in terms of the running coupling the renormalized poten-
tial is given by

vren =

and the callan-symanzik equation

 ~c(cid:17)vren = 0,

gives the following anomalous dimension for ~c,

(28)

(29)

(30)

where now (s) is the riemanns zeta function. this
completes the derivation of the eective lagrangian (13).

this should be compared with that of the gluon eld in
perturbative qcd, ( ~a) = 5g2/242 for su (2).

clearly the eective action provides the following non-

this is nothing but the skyrme-faddeev lagrangian
which allows the topological knot solitons as the classical
solutions [7].
it is truly remarkable that the skyrme-
faddeev lagrangian can be derived as an eective la-
grangian of qcd in the low energy limit. our analysis
establishes the deep connection that exists between the
generalized non-linear sigma model of skyrme-faddeev
type and qcd.

we conclude with the following remarks:

1) one might question (legitimately) the validity of the
one loop approximation, since in the infra-red limit the
non-perturbative eect is supposed to play the essential
role in qcd. our attitude on this issue is that qcd can
be viewed as the perturbative extension of the topological
eld theory obtained by the abelian projection, so that
the non-perturbative eect in the low energy limit can ef-
fectively be represented by the topological structure of the
restricted gauge theory. this is reasonable, because the
large scale structure of the monopole topology naturally
describes the long range behavior of the theory. in fact
it has been shown that it is the abelian projection of the
restricted theory that contributes to the wilson loop in-
tegral, which provides the connement criteria in qcd
in the low energy limit [13]. so we believe that our clas-
sical monopole background automatically takes care of
the essential feature of the non-perturbative eect, which
should make the one loop approximation reliable.
2) notice that there is a fundamental dierence between
our theory described by (10), which we called the ex-
tended gauge theory [3], and the perturbative qcd. the
extended theory, with the explicit presence of n, has
more degrees of freedom. this is because the topolog-
ical eld n becomes dynamical after one integrates out
all the dynamical degrees of the perturbative qcd, which
is evident from (31). indeed our analysis shows explic-
itly how the topological degrees can be transformed into
the dynamical degrees through the quantum correction,
which is really remarkable. but it must be emphasized
at the classical level it can not be viewed as dynamical
(i.e., propagating) because one can always remove it by a
gauge transformation, at least locally. it is the quantum
correction which makes n dynamical.
3) there have been two competing proposals for the cor-
rect mechanism of the connement in qcd, the one em-
phasizing the role of the instantons and the other empha-
sizing that of the monopoles. our analysis strongly sup-
ports the monopole condensation as the physical mech-
anism for the connement.
it provides the correct dy-
namical symmetry breaking mechanism for the monopole
condensation, and demonstrates the existence of the mass
gap in the infra-red limit of qcd, based on the rst prin-
ciples.

it must be clear from our analysis that the existence
of the magnetic condensation is a generic feature of the
non-abelian gauge theory. a more detailed discussion,

including vacuum stability and the the generalization of
our result to su (3), will be presented in a forthcoming
paper [13].
