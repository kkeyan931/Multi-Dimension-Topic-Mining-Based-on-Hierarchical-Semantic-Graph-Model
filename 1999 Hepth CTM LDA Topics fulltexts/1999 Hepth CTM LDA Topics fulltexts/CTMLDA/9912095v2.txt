dierent chiral anomalies when the variations are chiral transformations. for these dierent
regularizations, i then consider variations associated with poincare transformations. i nd
that both lorentz and translational invariance are anomalously violated in general, but that
they are respected when the variations of the determinant are regularized to give a wess-
zumino consistent anomaly (the bardeen anomaly). if the variations are regularized to give
a covariant anomaly, then poincare invariance is not respected. following manohar in an
investigation of poincare anomalies in a chiral gauge theory, this gives an alternative way
to understand the need for a consistent regularization of the variations of the fermionic

introduction

in many approaches to the problem of deriving low energy eective theories of qcd we are
required to calculate a variation of the fermionic determinant with respect to a chiral transfor-
mation. for example, in chiral perturbation theory we must construct the lagrangian for the
pseudoscalar octet so as to transform in the same way as the underlying qcd  including the
chiral anomalies [1].

for the calculation of such a variation it is necessary to choose a regularization, and in
general dierent choices of regularization leads to dierent expressions for the chiral anomalies.
if we consider for example a theory of a nonabelian dirac fermion coupled to external vector
(v ) and axial vector (a) sources, it is possible to regularize the chiral variation of the fermionic
determinant so that the divergence of the vector current vanishes and the divergence of the axial
vector current is equal to the wess-zumino consistent chiral anomaly [2]. another possibility
is to have covariant anomalies [3], in which case both the divergence of the current and of the
axial current are dierent from zero. (note that i am referring to anomalies for the divergence

of the same axial current for dierent regularizations, rather than anomalies for the divergence
of dierent currents within the same consistent theory, which is perhaps more conventional.)

a consistent regularization ensures that the anomalies satisfy wesszumino consistency con-
ditions. these consistency conditions are integrability conditions for the variation of the deter-
minant on gauge orbits of chiral gauge transformations [2, 4]. when the variation is regularized
in another way, like the covariant, the determinant itself it is not well dened. for example, it
cannot be obtained by integrating variations with respect to external elds.

in this paper i investigate the poincare transformation properties of the nonabelian va-
theory mentioned above, and i will show that for many other regularizations than the consistent
one poincare invariance is not respected. rather, it is broken by anomalies, that is, quantum
eects. for example, the theory with covariant regularization is not poincare invariant.

this provides an alternative way to understand the need for a consistent regularization when
variations of the fermionic determinant is calculated. it may be more useful to have a symmetry
argument for this, rather than the perhaps more unfamiliar integrability condition.

an investigation slightly related to the one in this paper was carried out some time ago by
manohar [5] (see also [6]). he demonstrated that for a theory of a chiral fermion where the
chiral anomalies did not cancel, there were also poincare anomalies, and he pointed out that
this was another way to interpret the need for anomaly cancellation.

it may also be worth pointing out that the poincare anomalies in this paper are not directly
related to the gravitational anomalies in ref. [7]. first of all, the theory is regularized consistently
in that paper, and the fermionic determinant in is well dened. furthermore, the anomalies
appear from feynman diagrams with a number of energy-momentum tensors at the vertices. the
poincare anomalies here, on the other hand, appear from diagrams with one energy-momentum
tensor and a number of vectors and axial vectors (for the translational anomalies), or one angular
momentum current and a number of vectors and axial vectors (for the lorentz anomalies).

the organization of the paper is the following. in sec. 2, i discuss the nonabelian va-theory
on the classical level, and in particular the symmetries of the model. in sec. 3, i discuss the
regularization of the variations of the fermionic determinant of the va-theory. the regularization
scheme i use is proper time regularization in minkowski space, which is convenient here because
the exact specication of the regularization is controlled by a regularization operator d,
related to the dirac operator d. i then discuss various choices for d. in sec. 4, i show that
the choice that leads to the wesszumino consistent bardeen anomaly leads to lorentz and
translational invariance. on the other hand, in sec. 5, i show that the choice that leads to the
covariant anomaly is not poincare invariant. sec. 6 is a brief summary.

2 classical symmetries of the va-theory

the nonabelian va-theory is chosen as a typical theory of a dirac fermion, and suitable for
illustration of the main points. it is given by the lagrangian

l = (d + i),

d = i6 6 v 6a5  .

(1)

 ta and a = aa

ta are external vector and axial vector sources, respectively, in
here, v = v a
the lie algebra of some group with generators ta. i have added a small mass  as an infrared
regulator, as well as an i. i will usually suppress both of these.

nothing in our discussion of this model is not well known, until we get to the part where
we consider the poincare transformations in the quantum theory. note, however, that i have
chosen to not treat the external sources as gauge elds, since gauge invariance is not important
for our considerations.

the symmetries of this theory on the classical level include global phase rotations and chiral
rotations, translations and lorentz transformations, provided we assign the appropriate trans-
formations rules to the external elds v and a. thus we have phase rotations

  ei,
  ei,

v + 5a  ei(v + 5a)ei,

with  = ata, chiral rotations

  ei5,
  ei5 ,

v + 5a  ei5(v + 5a)ei5,

with  = ata, translations

  eiap ,

v  eia p  veia p  ,
a  eia p  aeia p  ,

where p  i are the generators, and lorentz transformations

with generators j  1
2  + (xi  xi)  s + l . this list shows how the transfor-
mation rules for the external sources are chosen. note in particular that the phase and chiral
rotations are chosen for convenience to be global, since gauge invariance is not relevant here.

since these transformations are all symmetries, it means that the lagrangian transforms

under an innitesimal transformation by

l =  + 

(6)

with  = 0. we shall see that in the quantum theory, for regularizations that are not con-
sistent, this is not automatically true: quantum eects lead to  6= 0 for, e.g., the covariant
regularization  also for the poincare transformations. therefore, in that case the poincare
transformations are no longer symmetries of the theory.

finally, we may derive the classical conservation equations

j a = 0,
j a
5 = 0,

  ta,
j a
  5ta,
j 5a

(7)

where j and j 5

 are the fermion current and axial current.

3 the quantum theory

the quantum va-theory is given by the path integral

z = z dd eir d4x d  detd,

(8)

which also formally denes the fermionic determinant. the eective action w (z  eiw ) is
given by

w = itr ln d.

(9)

these expressions are formal and needs regularization to become well dened. however, we are
interested in the variations of the fermionic determinant under some innitesimal transforma-
tions. we should therefore consider such variations and regularize these instead.

with innitesimal parameters, the phase and chiral rotations of the fermions induce a change

in the dirac operator

d  ei+i5 dei+i5

= d + i(d  d) + i(d5 + 5d)
 d + d,

which in turn induces a change in w :

w = itrd

1
d

.

(10)

(11)

the jacobian j is then determined by the requirement that the path integral z is unchanged
under a change of variables:

z = jeiw +iw = eiw .
dening now a lagrangian by j  exp(ir d4xlj ), we have
z d4xlj = w = itrd

1
d

.

lj thus contains the anomalies, ga

 and ga
,

lj  aga

 + aga
,

(12)

(13)

(14)

and is therefore a quantity of interest.

when a regularization is specied, both the transformations (2) and (3) are in general seen

to be broken symmetries. we can then nd the conservation equations for the currents:

j a = ga
,
j a
5 = ga
.

(15)

since we know what the gs look like for dierent regularization schemes, at least the consistent
and covariant ones  see e.g. [4], we will use eqs. (15) later (sec. 5 and 6) to identify what scheme
we are in.

again note that, in the terminology used in this paper, the currents are always dened
in the same way in terms of the fermions, while the anomalies varies with the regularization
scheme. this is a dierence from the usual discussion of anomalies [3], where the regularization

4

is assumed to be consistent while dierent denitions of the currents are considered, each giving
dierent expressions for the anomalies.

let us also record that for the poincare transformations, the innitesimal variations of the

dirac operator d are

for the translations, and

d = i(dap   ap d)

d = i(d 1

2 j   1

2  j d)

(16)

(17)

for the lorentz transformations.

4 proper time regularization

the regularization scheme i will use is proper time regularization in minkowski space [8]. tra-
ditionally proper time regularization is used in connection with the euclidean formalism, see
e.g. the review [4]. however, it turns out to be a great advantage to work in minkowski space,
when dierent regularizations  consistent, covariant, etc.  are discussed, since in that case the
various prescriptions are conveniently controlled by the choice of a regularization operator d,
related to the dirac operator d. this will be discussed in the next sections; see also [8]. there is
also no need to perform analytical continuations of the elds and transformations in minkowski
space. but other regularization schemes should of course be possible.

we can introduce a proper time integral and the operator d in the following way:

1
z d4xlj = itrd
d
= itrd d
= z 

1/2

1
d d

dstrd deis(d d+i)

(18)

the operator d is a priori arbitrary, except that it must be chosen to give the right -prescription.
this will then ensure convergence at the upper integration limit. for the lower integration limit
the cuto  is introduced, which is to be taken to innity at the end of the calculation. when
the appropriate choice for d is made, lj will be regular and well dened.

we can use the expression for d from eq. (10) to perform the proper time integral and

write r d4xlj in a fujikawa-like form [9, 10]:

z d4xlj = z 

1/2

dstr i(d  d + d5 + 5d) deisd d
 eid d/2(cid:17)  tr 5(cid:16)ei dd/2

= tr (cid:16)ei dd/2

+ eid d/2(cid:17) .

(19)

here i have used the cyclicity of the trace, the identity deisd dd = ddeis dd, and the fact that
only the lower limit of the integral contributes due to the implicit presence of the . similarly,
for the lorentz transformations and translations we have

z d4xlj = tr 1

2 j  (cid:16)ei dd/2

 eid d/2(cid:17)
 eid d/2(cid:17) .

to proceed from here it is necessary to choose a d.

tr ap (cid:16)ei dd/2

5

(20)

5 consistent regularization

let us make the choice

d = (i5)d(i5)

= i6 6 v 6a5 + .

using the cyclicity of the trace and the fact that 5 commutes with , we have

z d4xlj = 2tr 5ei dd/2

.

(21)

(22)

the terms proportional to  in eq. (19) have thus canceled out.

we can nd out which kind of chiral anomaly this choice of d leads to. after a standard

calculation we get (see e.g. [11])

lj =

v and f 

a are the bardeen tensors,

f v
f a

  v  v + i[v, v ] + i[a, a ],
  a  a + i[v, a ] + i[a, v],

(23)

(24)

and dv
   + i[v,  ]. the terms proportional to the -tensor is the familiar bardeen anomaly
[12], while the other terms are of even intrinsic parity [13]. the bardeen anomaly is known
to be consistent [2], hence the regularization resulting from this choice for d is a consistent
regularization.

(actually, this is not the whole story: within the proper time scheme one also gets a term
proportional to 2 (and terms proportional to 1/2, 1/4,. . .) in addition to the -independent
terms in eq. (23). it is necessary to somehow remove this term if we intend to take  to innity
at the end of the calculation. this can be done by the paulivillars inspired regularization
described in [11]; see also [8]. this implies a theorem that we can simply drop all -dependent
terms.)

it is easy to see that not only the terms proportional to  in eq. (19) cancel out, but
also the terms proportional to a and  in eq. (20). hence the quantity  for the lorentz
transformations and translations vanishes for this regularization, and the theory is poincare
invariant, as expected.

6 covariant regularization

let us now instead make the choice

d = dc  cdt c 1

= i6 6 v +6a5 + .

6

(25)

this is the charge conjugate of d; c is the charge conjugation matrix and transposition is
with respect to the dirac matrix structure.

it is now no longer true that terms proportional to  in eq. (19) automatically cancel. for
a combination of a phase rotation with parameter  = ata and chiral phase rotation with
parameter  = ata we get

lj =

1

v f 
162 tr(cid:2)(f 
+(f 

a + f 
v f 

a f 
v )
v + f 
a f 
a )(cid:3) .

(26)

this is the expression for the covariant anomaly [4].

the presence of a term proportional to  means that the current is not conserved. this is

well known for a theory that is regularized to have a covariant anomaly [4, 1].

this form of d is similar to that of d in the euclidean formulation, where also the sign of
6a5 is changed relative to i6   6 v . in the euclidean case the operator d has a special status,
since it is used for the construction of the positive operators dd and dd. the positivity of
these operators will then ensure the convergence of the upper limit of the proper time integral,
instead of the i which has the same eect in minkowski space. for this reason the euclidean
formalism produces naturally the covariant anomaly, and it takes a considerable amount of
work to produce other anomalies, such as the consistent one [4].

within this regularization, we can now calculate the jacobian that corresponds to the trans-
lations and lorentz transformations. the procedure, which also includes some nonstandard
elements, is essentially the one described in ref. [8], where it was used in a slightly dierent
context. the result is

l =

(27)

(28)

even for  and a constants, there are terms in eqs. (27) and (28) that are not total derivatives,
i.e. of the form . in other words,  6= 0 for both lorentz transformations and translations.
thus, as advertized, poincare symmetry is violated in this case.

7 conclusion

we have seen that in the nonabelian va-theory considered in this paper, poincare symmetry
survives quantization for a regularization that leads to the consistent bardeen form of the chiral
anomaly, while it is anomalously broken for a regularization that leads to the covariant chiral
anomaly. of course many other choices for the regularization operator d can be made. (indeed
many other choices than proper time regularization can be made for the scheme itself.)
in
general poincare symmetry is violated since eq. (20) does not vanish for general choices for d.
manohar, who investigated poincare anomalies in a chiral gauge theory, pointed out that
chiral anomalies and poincare anomalies cancel simultaneously, since both are proportional
to the d-symbols. a similar result seems to be true here, i.e. that  6= 0 for the poincare
transformations whenever the s cancel out from eq. (19). the nonvanishing terms in  come
from the derivative operators in p and j .
