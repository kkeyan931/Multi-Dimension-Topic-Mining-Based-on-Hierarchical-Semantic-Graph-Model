abstract

in anti-de sitter (ads) space, classical supergravity solutions are repre-
sented holographically by conformal eld theory (cft) states in which op-
erators have expectation values. these 1-point functions are directly related
to the asymptotic behaviour of bulk elds. in some cases, distinct supergrav-
ity solutions have identical asymptotic behaviour; so dual expectation values
are insucient to distinguish them. we argue that non-local objects in the
gauge theory can resolve the ambiguity, and explicitly show that collections of
point particles in ads3 can be detected by studying kinks in dual cft green
functions. three dimensional black holes can be formed by collision of such par-
ticles. we show how black hole formation can be detected in the holographic
dual, and calculate cft quantities that are sensitive to the distribution of
matter inside the event horizon.

1 introduction

according to the holographic principle [1], quantum gravity in spacetimes with
some prescribed asymptotic behaviour can be described by a theory dened on the
boundary at innity. such a principle implies an enormous reduction in degrees of
freedom relative to conventional local quantum eld theory in the bulk spacetime.
nevertheless, everyday experience shows that local objects exist in the semiclassical
limit. so, in order to accept the holographic principle, it is necessary to understand
how such objects are encoded and detected in the holographic dual.

a simple example of holography is the proposed duality between gravity in anti-
de sitter (ads) spaces and local conformal eld theories (cfts) dened on the ads
boundary [2]. the semiclassical limit in ads is related to a large central charge limit
of the cft. in this context, classical supergravity probes are described by dual cft
states in which operators have expectation values derived directly from the asymptotic
behaviour of elds coupling to the probe [3]. this was used to show a scale-radius
duality for a variety of bulk sources, and for wavepackets of supergravity elds  the
radial position of a bulk probe is encoded in the scale size of the dual expectation
values. dynamical sources for supergravity elds were studied in [4], where the radial
position of a source particle following a bulk geodesic was reected in the size and
shape of an expectation-value bubble in the cft. other interesting work along these
lines was performed in [5]-[11].

the scale-radius duality provides a simple example of the holographic encoding
of information about the location and motion of objects in the additional spacetime
dimension. however, as we will discuss in sec. 2, the simple scale-radius relationship
is a consequence of an isometry in pure ads under rescalings of all coordinates. for
spacetimes such as black holes which break the isometries, the relationship between
bulk position and boundary observables will be more complicated. we will illustrate
this point by discussing a dilaton source falling into a btz black hole, following
danielsson et.al. [4]. the same phenomenon is apparent in the collision of two par-
ticles to form a black hole in [11]; after the particles collide, their radial position is
xed, but the scales in the boundary expectation values continue to evolve.

if a simple scale-radius duality fails, do cft expectation values still tell us the
location of bulk sources? in sec. 2, we will review the surprising power of the ex-
pectation values, and discuss what one can learn about the bulk in general. if we
write ads in the global coordinate system, all the normalizable mode spherical har-
monics fall o at the same rate at the spacetime boundary. as a result, expectation
values of the dual operators contain all the multipole moments of any bulk solution
which is constructed by superposition of these modes. therefore, such supergravity
congurations will be completely determined by the cft one-point functions.

however, there are distinct supergravity congurations which are identical outside
of some region. examples include spacetimes with spherically symmetric matter
distributions, and collections of point particles in 2 + 1 dimensions.1 it is important
to describe these examples from the cft perspective, because they include simple
processes of particular interest, such as spherically symmetric collapse to form a
black hole.
in such cases, cft expectation values will not resolve distinct bulk
congurations. we will argue that there are non-local quantities in the gauge theory
that can provide the necessary data.

1the matter sources in these solutions must have sharp cutos  otherwise they would be detected
in dual 1-point functions as above. thus, they are not made from the supergravity elds, all of which
have tails at innity. one might perhaps think of them as made up of massive strings.

2

the core of this paper is the use of the feynman green function to extract informa-
tion about bulk solutions from the cft. we consider asymptotically ads3 spacetimes
containing point particles, as this is a particularly tractable example. in sec. 3, we
derive the eect of a stationary particle on the green function of an operator dual to
a scalar eld. we compute the green function by a wkb approximation, relating it
to the length of geodesics, and nd that the particles presence is signalled by a kink
in the propagator. in sec. 4, we show how the motion of particles in ads3 is reected
in these kinks.

in ads3, the head-on collision of particles produces a btz black hole [12] if
the combined energy exceeds a certain threshold. we show in sec. 5 that in the
holographic description of this process there are initially two kinks in the cft green
function, indicating the separate positions of the two particles. the discontinuities
approach each other and merge into a single one associated with the nal black hole.
remarkably, the kinks are sensitive to the positions of the particles inside the event
horizon, until their eventual collision to form a singularity. this supports the assertion
that the holographic dual gives a unitary description of processes localized inside a
black hole horizon, which should have important implications for information loss.
flat space may be obtained from ads by taking the length scale () of the spacetime
to innity. the measurement precision required for detecting the separation of two
particles increases with .
in the at space limit, we nd that innite precision
measurements are required in the holographic dual to three dimensional gravity to
detect the dierence between one and two bulk particles.

we conclude in sec. 6 by drawing some general lessons from our work and sug-

gesting directions for the future.

2 classical probes and dual expectation values

in the lorentzian version of the ads/cft correspondence, we must specify both
boundary conditions at innity and initial conditions for the normalizable modes in
spacetime. changing the boundary conditions at innity corresponds to turning on
sources in the dual cft, while the choice of normalizable modes corresponds to the
state [13]. in [3], it was shown that both of these choices will aect the one-point
functions of the operators dual to supergravity elds, and the eect of a number of
bulk sources on the expectation values was explicitly calculated. here, we wish to
make some general comments, drawing on previously studied examples for support.
the expectation value of the cft operator is essentially given by the asymptotic
value of the normalizable modes [13]. in poincare coordinates,

ho(x)i =  n(x) + cz ddx 0(x)
|x  x|2 .

(1)

3

the rst term is the eect of a normalizable mode n(z, x), behaving as z n(x) as
z  0, and the second term is the eect of a change in the boundary conditions by
0(x).

the normalizable modes of scalar elds of mass m in global adsd+1 with scale 

behave as [13]

2f1(a, b, c; cos2 ),

 = eit yl,{m}() (cos ) (sin )l

(2)
where the boundary is at  = /2,  = (d + d2 + 4m22)/2, and yl,{m}() denotes
spherical harmonics on sd1. the fallo of the modes as   /2 is independent
of the angular quantum numbers. thus, the dual expectation values ho(t, )i will
determine all the spherical harmonics, and therefore all the multipole moments, of
the bulk solution.2

this ensures that the expectation values will contain all information about any
solution constructed by superposition of the basic modes (2). at innity, the elds
fall o exponentially in proper distance, but the exponential is the same for all modes.
although the bulk elds are themselves minuscule at the boundary, cft expectation
values are given by the nite prefactor to the decaying exponential.

2.1 scale-radius duality: the power of symmetry

as seen in the examples discussed in [3, 5], and in several subsequent papers, the
radial position of supergravity sources in pure ads is encoded in the dual one-point
function in a particularly simple way; radial translation of the source corresponds to
a rescaling of the corresponding expectation value. this is called scale-radius duality,
and is an example of a general relationship between radial positions and boundary
scales [14, 7].

for sources at xed poincare coordinate radial positions, this relation follows

because the ads metric is unchanged by the rescaling

x  x,

z  z.

(3)

given the solution describing a source at some radial position, we can describe a source
at a dierent radial position by the redenition (3). the eect on the asymptotic
elds, and hence the one-point function, is simply a rescaling of the coordinates [3].
in global ads, symmetry dictates that a source at the origin is represented by
a cft expectation value which is constant over the boundary sphere. there is an
isometry mapping this source to one following any other geodesic in the spacetime.

2in ads2, the bulk spacetime has two boundaries; however, specifying the boundary conditions
and expectation values on one boundary is sucient to determine the bulk solutions, and hence
the values on the other boundary. therefore the ads2 theory has only one set of independent
observables, corresponding to the expected dual quantum mechanics.

4

this isometry acts as a conformal transformation in the dual cft, a fact exploited
in [4, 8] to obtain cft expectation values dual to moving sources in the bulk.

in cases with less symmetry, the story is more complicated. a good example is
a point source for the dilaton falling into a btz black hole, which was studied by
danielsson et.al. [4] using the method of images and the result for sources in ads3.
in the lightlike limit, such a particle entering the boundary at t = 0, produces the
asymptotic dilaton eld

where  = t  and r are the horizons.3 therefore, the corresponding expectation
value is concentrated on the light cones t = , as for a single particle in ads5 [8]. the
sum over n implements the periodic identication of  in the btz black hole. simple
scale-radius duality fails here, in the sense that the two light cones cross repeatedly;
so the scale size goes to zero, e.g. at t = , while the particle never returns to the
boundary. in fact, the information concerning the location of the particle in the bulk
seems to be contained in the amplitude of , which steadily declines in time.

a related example is a pair of particles colliding to form a black hole  the bound-
ary expectation value associated with each particle will continue to evolve indepen-
dently after the collision, reaching zero scale size at a later time [11]. in this case
also, the isometries used above are not available, being broken by the metric in the
region to the future of both particles. consequently, the simple connection between
scale size and radial position fails to apply directly.

2.2 resolving bulk objects with propagators

there are also examples where the cft expectation values implied by (1) do not
fully characterize a semiclassical bulk state. for example, a spherical shell of matter
placed at any position within ads will have the same asymptotic elds and dual 1-
point functions. (requiring the matter distribution to have compact support implies
that these objects are not built from the supergravity modes (2), all of which have
tails at innity.) similarly, the only supergravity data available at innity about a
collection of point particles in ads3 is the total mass. so, the dual cft stress tensor
has an expectation value [15, 16, 17], but this is insucient to count the particles or
locate them in spacetime.

nevertheless, the cft should somehow encode the dierence between these bulk
congurations. we wish to identify some cft quantities that probe the interior of the
spacetime and characterize the bulk solutions conveniently. these quantities should
be non-local from the cft perspective, because the scale-radius duality teaches us

3our source particle has a slightly dierent normalization from the one in [4].

5

that locations further inside the spacetime correspond to larger scales in the gauge
theory. wilson loop expectation values are such quantities  they depend on the
action of strings that start on the boundary and penetrate the spacetime [18]. we
can also use scattering amplitudes for the operators dual to supergravity elds. as
we will see, in the wkb approximation the cft propagator is dominated by bulk
geodesics. since these penetrate the spacetime, they can be used to distinguish bulk
congurations with identical asymptotic elds. recently this approach has been ap-
plied to spherical shells of matter in ads5 [19], which will be analyzed further in a
forthcoming paper involving one of us [20]. in the remainder of this paper we will
work out the details of this procedure for resolving point particles in three dimensions.

3 stationary particles in ads3

global ads3 is described by the metric

ds2 = d2 + sinh2  d2 cosh2  dt2 = (cid:18) 2

1  r2(cid:19)2

1  r2!2
(dr2 + r2d2)  1 + r2

dt2. (5)

we have set the ads length scale  to one,  has a period 2, time runs between
 and 0  r = tanh(/2)  1 is the radial coordinate. fixed t surfaces have
the poincare disc geometry, and the dual cft is dened on the cylinder at the
r = 1 boundary. the mass of ads3 may be computed as in [17] to be m = 1/8g
and is equal to the ground state energy of the dual conformal eld theory [21]. we
will introduce point particles into this spacetime and will show that kinks in the
propagator for cft operators in the dual state locate the particle in the spacetime.
it is helpful to begin by recasting the computation of cft correlators from ads3 in
a language that is convenient for generalization to point particle states.

3.1 ads3 geodesics and dual propagators
a generic scalar eld of mass m in asymptotically ads3 spaces is dual to an operator o
of conformal dimension  = 1+1 + m2. we are going to show how the properties of
point particles in ads3 can be read o from the green functions of such operators. it
is helpful to begin by computing the propagator in the conformally invariant vacuum.
we can normalize the operator o so that on the euclidean plane (ds2 = dx2
2 =
dr2 + r2d2) its 2-point function is constrained by conformal invariance to be

1 + dx2

ho(x)o(x)i =

1

|x  x|2 =

1

(r2 + r2  2rr cos ) ,

(6)

where r and r are the distances from the origin and  is the angle between x and x.
transform to the euclidean cylinder (ds2 = dt2 + d2) by setting r = et and weyl

6

rescaling the metric by e2t. let   z   parametrize any closed curve on this
cylinder with the condition

b(z)  (t(z), (z)) = (t(z),(z))

imposed for later convenience. then

t (z)  lnh o(b(z))o(b(z))i = 2 ln( 2 sin (z) ).

(7)

(8)

wick rotating to lorentzian signature (ds2 = dt2 + d2) leaves (8) unchanged, but
in lorentzian signature it should be understood as the logarithm of the feynman
green function for o. we want to reproduce this from the ads/cft correspondence
in a manner convenient for generalization to point particles in ads3.

the cft dual to ads3 is dened on a cylinder with diverging weyl factor. so
the green function for dual operators at any nite coordinate separation will vanish.
it is convenient to regulate this behaviour by cutting o the spacetime at a boundary
dened by

rm(t, ) = 1  (t, ),

(t, ) = (t,),

(9)

where  is some smooth function of the boundary coordinates. the symmetry of 
under    is merely chosen to reduce verbiage in the remainder of this paper, and
ensures that boundary curves b(z) satisfying (7) also satisfy rm(b(z)) = rm(b(z)).
according to [5], the propagator for o in the dual cft is obtained by evaluating the
spacetime propagator between the corresponding points on the cuto boundary at rm
(also see [22]). in the limit   0, we expect the green function computed this way
to scale to zero as the weyl factor of the boundary metric diverges.

dening the cuto boundary curve

b(z)  (b(z), rm(b(z))),

(10)

the propagator for a scalar eld of mass m between points b(z) should be given by
(11)

g(b(z), b(z)) = z dp ei l(p).

(we will always be interested in large masses so that   m.) here we are summing
over all particle paths between the two boundary points and l(p) = r (g x  x )1/2
is the proper length of the path. (dened this way, l(p) is imaginary for spacelike
trajectories.) as a check, note that the action accumulated along a stationary trajec-
tory should be e0t where e0 is the lowest energy the particle can have. a scalar eld
of mass m in ads3 has lowest energy eigenvalue  [13]  so the paths in (11) are
weighted by exp(i l). in the semiclassical wkb approximation, the path integral
localizes to its saddlepoints and is given by a sum over geodesics

g(b(z), b(z)) = xg

7

e lg(b(z),b(z)).

(12)

here lg is the (real) geodesic length between the boundary points. according to [5],
in the large n limit, (12) is also the cft propagator.

to check this statement, we will reproduce the known green function of o (8)
from (12) in global ads3. as discussed by matschull [23], equal-time geodesics of (5)
are circle segments obeying the equation

tanh  cos(  ) = cos(),

(13)

where the geodesic reaches the  =  boundary at  =   . setting  = 0, and
cutting o the spacetime at

rm = tanh(m/2) = 1  (t, ),

(14)

the unique geodesic between the boundary points (t,) intersects the cut o bound-
ary at 

m which are xed by

tanh m cos 

m = cos().

our convenient choice (t, ) = (t,) implies that
m  m.

m = +

 

then the length of a geodesic travelling between (t, m,m) is

l(m,m) = 2 lnhsinh m sin m + (sinh2 m sin2 m + 1)1/2i .

(15)

(16)

(17)

so, to leading order in (z)  (b(z)), the geodesic length between the points b(z)
on the cut o boundary curve is

(z) ! .
l(b(z), b(z)) = 2 ln  2 sin (z)

(18)

using (12) and [5], the cft propagator and the bulk propagator are equated to give

(z) !
t (z)  ln g(b(z), b(z)) = 2 ln  2 sin (z)

(19)

in the   0 limit, where the boundary metric is ds2 = (1/(t, )2)(dt2 + d2).
this is exactly right from the ads/cft perspective since (8) is dened on the weyl
rescaled cylinder ds2 = dt2 + d2.

3.2 stationary particles

stationary point particles are introduced in three dimensional gravity by excising a
wedge from the spacetime (5). (for example, see [16, 23] and references therein.) a
massive particle can only be stationary in (5) at r = 0, and leads to the spacetime

drawn in fig. 1. the two coordinate systems displayed in the gure remove dierent
wedges of the poincare disc:

c1 :

c2 :

 +  >  >   ,
  <  < .

(20)

in both cases the wedge boundaries are identied. the dual cft is still dened on
the boundary at innity, a cylinder whose spatial circle can always be chosen to have
a period 2 by a coordinate transformation. we would like to know how the presence
of the particle is registered in the cft.

since the asymptotic spacetime is locally ads, local measurements on the space-
time boundary cannot tell us that there is a particle in the interior. nevertheless,
the mass of the particle is available globally  integrating the spacetime stress tensor
of [17] over the truncated range of  gives

m = 

1
8g

+



8g

.

(21)

the second term is the contribution of the particle. equivalently, in the chern-simons
formulation of three dimensional gravity, the mass of the particle is registered in the
holonomy of the chern-simons gauge elds [16]. within the ads/cft context, the
computation that gives (21) also gives the energy of the dual cft state. stationary
particle spacetimes exist in the range 0     with the associated masses 1/8g 
m < 0. the range m  0 is occupied by the spectrum of btz black holes [12].

if multiple particles are placed in ads3, a similar calculation will show that the
expectation value of the dual stress tensor yields the total mass of the particles.
however, this is not enough data to locate the particles in spacetime or count them.
so we seek other ways of detecting point particles in ads3. we would like a quantity
in the dual cft that probes the interior of the bulk geometry. the propagator is
such an object, since it is determined by bulk geodesics running between boundary
points.

9

following the pure ads analysis, consider the coordinate system c1 and cut o
the spacetime as in (9). as before, consider closed spacelike curves b(z) satisfying (7)
on the ads boundary, and the associated cuto boundary curve b(z) (10). geodesics
running between b(z) for small 1(z) will not pass through the wedge. their length
is therefore given by the ads3 result (18):

l(b(z), b(z)) = 2 ln  2 sin 1(z)

(z)

! .

(22)

for large 1(z), the geodesics will run through the excised wedge. to analyze these
trajectories it is convenient transform to coordinates c2:

;

;

;

t2 = t1

r2 = r1

2 = 1 +  (1 > 0)

2 = 1  (1 < 0). (23)
the geodesics that intersect the identication in c1 are precisely those that miss it
in c2 and vice versa. the pure ads result in c2 gives the length of geodesics passing
through the c1 wedge. for some intermediate values of (z) there are two geodesics
between the points b(z). however, the sum (12) is dominated by the geodesic with
shortest, length which we will now focus on.

by symmetry, the endpoints of the minimum length geodesics that do and do not

pass through the c1 wedge must be separated by the surface

 1 =  

  

2

.

(24)

let z be the parameter where 1(z) =  . the geodesics between b(z) for 0  z  z
then foliate a spacelike surface on one side of the particle worldline, while z  z
generates a spacelike surface on the other side. it is easy to check that neither of
these surfaces touches the particle worldline, but they meet at the ads boundary at
the angles 1 =  . together they sweep out a spacelike surface that cuts through
ads, but has a tear in it which could be lled by a spacelike patch. the worldline of
the particle passes through this tear.
in c1 coordinates we then have:

0  1(z)   :
  1(z)     :

l(b(z), b(z)) = 2 ln  2 sin 1(z)
! .
l(b(z), b(z)) = 2 ln  2 sin(1(z) + )

(z)

(z)

following the discussion for pure ads3,

t (z)  ln g(b(z), b(z)) =  l(b(z), b(z)).

there is a kink in t at the coordinate z = z at which 1(z) = :
tan(cid:18)
2(cid:19)

z #z+ "t

= 2  1(z)

z !z=z

k = "t

10

! .

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

so the mass of the particle in the bulk can be determined from the strength of the
kink in green functions of generic scalar operators in the dual cft state:4

8gmparticle =  = 2 tan1 

k

4(1(z)/z)|z=z!

(29)

the family of geodesics between b(z) foliates a spacelike
moral of the story:
surface that cuts across the bulk spacetime. this surface has a tear in it which
surrounds the world-line of the stationary particle at the spacetime origin. the kink
in the cft propagator (28) arises because of the sudden jump between geodesics
passing on one side and the other of the particle. in the next section we will use a
similar strategy to locate moving particles in ads3 by examining the resulting moving
kinks in cft propagators.

4 moving particles in ads3

boosting the stationary particle above leads to a moving particle spacetime. following
matschull [23], we parametrize ads3 as an sl(2,r) manifold via

x = cosh  (cos t 1 + sin t 0) + sinh  (cos  1 + sin  2) ,

(30)

with gamma matrices

1 =   1 0

0 1! ;

0 =   0
1

0! ;

1 =   0

0! ;

2 =   1

0 1! .

(31)

here (t, , ) are the same coordinates appearing in (5). a boost along  = 0 is
performed by the sl(2,r) transformation

x = u1 x u;

u = cosh(/2) 1  sinh(/2) 2.

(32)

applying this boost to the c1 and c2 coordinate systems for a stationary particle
yields the corresponding descriptions of a moving particle.

the relation between the boosted and stationary (subscript s) coordinates is

cosh  cos t = cosh s cos ts,
cosh  sin t = cosh s sin ts cosh  + sinh s cos s sinh ,
sinh  cos  = sinh s cos s cosh  + cosh s sin ts sinh ,
sinh  sin  = sinh s sin s.

(33)

4the kink (28) was computed in the leading approximation. it is actually somewhat smoothed
out by interference between the two geodesics that exist between boundary points in the vicinity of
(z) = , one of which enters the identication. nevertheless, there is data in the propagator that
determines the mass of the bulk particle. in the case of the lightlike particles studied in the next
sections there is a unique geodesic between boundary points, leading to a genuine kink.

(the last equation is redundant, but is retained for convenience.) the particle that
was stationary at the origin is now following the periodic trajectory

tanh  = (1)n sin t tanh  ,

(34)

with n any integer. the boost in (32) is an isometry and leaves the metric unchanged,
but the identications in (20) take a dierent form in the new coordinates. in the
new c1 and c2 coordinates, t dependent wedges are removed behind and in front of
the particle respectively, relative to its motion at t = 0.

for purposes of illustration, we will examine the holographic representation of
lightlike particles moving through ads3. to obtain such objects, take the limit m 
0,    while keeping m sinh  = tan  xed. then, using (33) for the boost
(32) and a similar relation for its inverse, the relation between the new c1 and c2
coordinates is:

cosh 1 cos t1 = cosh 2 cos t2,

cosh 1 sin t1 = cosh 2 sin t2 1 +
sinh 1 cos 1 = sinh 2 cos 2 1

the boundaries of the excised wedge in c1 (c2) map to 2 =  (1 = 0) in c2

in either c1 or c2 coordinates with sinh e  tan te so that the endpoints are always

which does not pass through the identication if e < , where

sin te  tanh e cos  = 0.

similarly, in c2, there is a geodesic which does not pass through the identication
if e >  (in c1, these are the geodesics which do pass through the identication).
the surfaces dened by (37) in c1 and c2 coordinates are identical; hence, there is
a unique geodesic between any pair of endpoints.

the coordinates (33, 35) have the virtue that constant time slices are simply
identications of the poincare disc. however, constant t1 and t2 slices do not coincide.
worse still, constant t slices have a kink in them  the vector / is discontinuous
at the identication. we avoid subtleties by working, as before, on some smooth
spacelike slice of the boundary; in c1 coordinates the curve is b(z) = (t1(z), 1(z))
satisfying (7). the smooth cuto at rm(t, ) in (9) translates into 1m(t1, 1) in c1.
so we have the cuto boundary curve b(z) = (b(z), 1m(z)), following (10). similar
expressions in c2 are obtained by the coordinate transformation (35). as the curve
b(z) passes through the separation surface dened by (37), geodesics between b(z)
cross over the bulk particle.

geodesics between b(z) that avoid the c1 identication intersect the cut o

boundary at 1m where, following (15),

tanh 1m cos 1m = cos .

(38)

these geodesics have a path length (17) in c1 coordinates. the separation condition
(37) determines some z such that, for z > z, geodesics between b(z) intersect the
c1 identication. by construction, these geodesics miss the c2 identication and so
have a length (17) in c2 coordinates. setting

s1(z) = sinh 1m(z) sin 1m(z);

s2(z) = sinh 2m(z) sin 2m(z),

(39)

we have

0  z  z :
z  z   :

l(z) = 2 lnhs1(z) + (s1(z)2 + 1)1/2i .
l(z) = 2 lnhs2(z) + (s2(z)2 + 1)1/2i .

(40)

(41)

as already established, t (z) = l(z) as m  . the functions s1(z) and
s2(z) are related by the last equation of (35), and, along with the separation condition
(37), this shows that

so t (z) is a continuous function of z. however, the derivative dt /dz is discontinuous
at z. let

s1(z) = s2(z)  s(z).

again using (35) and (37), k vanishes only if

" d

(sin t2(z)  tanh 2(z) cos 2(z))#z=z

= 0.

(44)

this fails since z = z is exactly the point where b(z) intersects the vanishing locus
of the quantity being dierentiated. thus, there is a kink in t (z) at the surface (37)
where the geodesics cross over the particle.

in the holographic cft, we can identify the position of
locating the particle:
the kink with the position of the moving particle in the bulk. the arguments above
showed that in c1 coordinates, there is a kink at

cos 1(z) =

sin t1(z)

tanh 1m(z)

(45)

as we remove the cuto (m  ), the kink is at z where cos 1(z) = sin t1(z). so,
recalling (36), we can locate the particle in the bulk at the radial position

1(z)  /2 :
1(z)  /2 :

sinh  =  tan (1(z)  /2))
sinh  = tan (1(z)  /2)) .

(46)

as in sec. 3, the geodesics running between b(z) sweep out a spacelike surface that
cuts across the bulk spacetime. for a stationary particle, this surface had a spacelike
hole in it through with the particle worldline passed. here, the surface foliated by the
geodesics also has a tear in it that stretches between the two boundary points where
the curve b(z) intersects the separation surface (37). however, it is readily shown
that unlike the stationary case this tear can be patched by a null surface  one edge
of the tear is always later than the other along a null line. the two sheets on either
side of the tear are swept out by geodesics that do and do not pass through the c1
identications, and each sheet touches the null particle worldline at one point. the
formulae (46) locate the radial position of the earlier intersection.

for simplicity, we imposed symmetry conditions like (7) and (9) on our regulated
boundary surfaces and on the curve b(z). in general, we simply have some closed,
spacelike curve on the ads boundary, which we parametrize in some arbitrary way
as b(z) with   z   . to compute the propagator, we impose some cuto
m(t, ), and study geodesics between the points b(z) (b(z)  [b(z), m(z)]).
each parametrization of the curve leads to a dierent family of geodesics sweeping
out a dierent surface in spacetime. the lightlike bulk particle will pass through a
tear in this surface, touching the edges of the tear. kinks in the cft propagators
can be used to detect these locations.

ds2

0 =  cosh2 dt2 + d2 + sinh2 (d2 + sin2 dd3),

(48)

then the surfaces of constant time are generated as surfaces of revolution from a
poincare disc; that is, the two-dimensional subsurfaces given by choosing a pair of
antipodal points on the sd3 are poincare discs. we have singled out an axis in (48);
assume this is the direction along which the particle falls. then in (47),

y+ =

cosh  sin t  sinh  cos 

1 + cosh  cos t

,

and the poincare disc is changed by the addition of a delta-function at

sin t  tanh  cos  = 0.

(49)

(50)

this in turn implies that the expectation value of the cft stress tensor contains a
delta function [8], the location of which, comparing (50) and (37), is exactly analogous
to the location of the kink in the cft propagator we have found in the ads3 case.

5 colliding particles

the techniques developed above for single particles can also be applied to two colliding
lightlike particles. when the energy in the collision is low, the result is the single
particle spacetime of sec. 3, but above a certain threshold a black hole is created. the
representation of this process in the dual cft is central to understanding holographic
descriptions of gravity. the only data available in the supergravity elds at innity
is the total energy of the particles, and we seek ways of locating and counting them.
again, the propagator for an operator dual to a generic ads3 scalar eld provides
more information. as above, consider a one-parameter family of propagators whose
associated geodesics foliate a spacelike surface in the bulk. prior to the collision we
expect the null particle worldlines to pass through tears in this surface. generically
this will lead to two cft propagator kinks, arising as the bulk geodesics dominating
the calculation cross over the particle worldlines.
it is possible to have a single
kink by choosing a family of propagators whose associated geodesics hop over both
particles simultaneously. but such special families have zero measure in the space of
possibilities we are considering, and so we will ignore them.

figure 3: colliding particles in ads3. the edges of the excised regions are identied.

as discussed by matschull [23], a spacetime containing two particles is derived by
excising a wedge for each particle from ads3. in the center of mass (com) frame,
particles approaching each other head-on can be displayed as in fig. 3. particles a
and b enter the spacetime at t = /2 at  =  and  = 0 respectively and follow
the trajectory sinh  =  tan t (36) until they collide at t = 0. in fig. 3, each particle
has a wedge excised behind its trajectory  if one particle was removed, the other
would be in a c1 coordinate system from the previous section.5 we are interested in
geodesics running between the points (te,e, e) where e  . for large (small)
e, we expect the geodesics to enter the particle a (b) identication while for e
in the vicinity of /2 both wedges should be avoided. following the single particle
analysis and (37), we arrive at the two separation conditions

sin te  tanh e cos a = 0;

sin te  tanh e cos(  b) = 0.

(51)

at any given te and e, geodesics that start at  > a ( < b) intersect the a
(b) identication, while geodesics starting at a <  < b pass between the two
particles. at t = 0 the particles meet, and a = b = /2.

again, consider closed spacelike boundary curves b(z) satisfying (7) with  
z  . cut o the spacetime at m(t, ) satisfying (9) and dene the associated
curves b(z) (10) on the cut o boundary. the separation conditions (51) determine
za and zb at which geodesics between b(z) enter the a and b identications. then
arguments identical to sec. 4 show that there are kinks at za and zb. at t = 0 the
two separation surfaces (51) meet and so the two kinks join into a single one.

in the m   limit, (51) shows
locating the particles prior to collision:
that the kinks occur at za and zb satisfying cos (za) = sin t(za) and cos (zb) =
sin t(zb). we can thus locate the two bulk particles at sinh a = tan((za)  /2)
and sinh b =  tan((zb)  /2) prior to their collision. the surface swept out
by the geodesics between b(z) has components foliated respectively by geodesics
5for particle b, we have to reect the c1 coordinates around the  = /2 axis. for example,

angles in the range 0     are mapped to   .

passing behind a, between a and b, and behind b. each component is spacelike and
they meet at the positions on the ads boundary where the curve b(z) intersects the
separation surfaces (51). however, in the bulk of spacetime, the three components are
separated by two tears through which the particle worldlines pass. as before, it can
be shown that these tears can be patched by a null surface  the tear edges passing
between the particles are separated by null lines from the edges passing behind the
particles. each particle worldline touches the edges of a tear, and we have used cft
kinks to locate the radial position of the earlier intersection.

the at space limit: flat space can be obtained from ads by taking the limit
   while keeping radial coordinate positions r =  tanh(/2) xed. (see [24] for
discussions of the recovery of at space from ads.) in this limit, the proper length
between the a and b particles is simply 2ra and a = b  0. so, the kinks will
occur at (z)  /2  a. as    the proper length between any two boundary
points is diverging. however, since za  zb in this limit, the ratio of the proper
length between the locations of the kinks and the proper length of the boundary as
whole tends to zero. this is symptomatic of a need for extreme precision in cft
measurements to resolve bulk objects at nite separation in the at space limit.

in (35), we derived the spacetime
collision below the black hole threshold:
of a lightlike particle by boosting a mass m particle with rapidity , while keeping
m sinh  = tan  xed. the parameter  is related to the energy of the particle, and
it is readily shown that the head-on collision of two particles with   /4 creates a
btz black hole [23]. below threshold, the collision produces the stationary particle
spacetime in sec. 3, which we now analyze.

figs. 4a and 4b display the creation of a stationary particle. the particles a and
b in fig. 3 enter the spacetime at t = /2 and collide at the origin at t = 0. after

figure 5: com, btz and matschulls btzm slices of a black hole spacetime formed
by collision of lightlike particles. the slices are drawn at dierent times for pictorial
clarity. this is not really a penrose diagram  the mappings between the coordinate
systems do not preserve circular symmetry, and so we have simply displayed xed
angle slices in each.

this time the spacetime in 4b is identical to that in fig. 1, but is presented in skewed
coordinates  equal time slices in the two gures do not coincide. the two patches in
4b have identied edges and the single stationary particle s at the tip of the patches
follows an oscillatory timelike trajectory that never reaches the spacetime boundary,
as appropriate to a massive particle [23]. prior to the collision, we have shown that
there are two kinks in the cft propagator which approach each other. the kinks
arise because the bulk surface foliated by geodesics between b(z) has two tears in
it surrounding the particle worldlines. at t = 0, the two tears merge because there
are no longer any geodesics passing between the particles. so, as manifest in figs. 4a
and 4b, there is only one kink in the equal-time propagator when t  0, arising as the
associated geodesics switch between the two identications. the two-kink to one-kink
transition at t = 0 marks the creation of the joint particle.

5.1 black hole formation

if the particles have a total mass greater than 1/8g, they will form a black hole upon
colliding. we therefore have an exact metric describing the formation of a black hole.
three dierent coordinate systems are convenient for describing various aspects of
the cft representation of this process.

in center of mass (com) coordinates, the process is shown in figs. 4c  4f follow-
ing [23]. the particles enter the spacetime at t = /2 and follow the trajectory in
fig. 3. at some later time t =   /2, an event horizon forms at the thin dashed
line in 4c. it grows as the particles approach each other, and the collision at t = 0
in fig. 4d creates a spacelike singularity behind the horizon. successive com spatial
slices for t > 0 intersect this surface at the point s in figs. 4d and 4e. as time passes,
this point recedes towards the boundary of the poincare disc along a spacelike curve.
it reaches the boundary at some t =  which is the nal spacetime point. a picture

of com slices in the global spacetime is shown in fig. 5. it will transpire that cft
propagators are easiest to compute in these coordinates. however, the spatial slices
have a kink in them at the identications, so they are not entirely natural from the
cft point of view.

smoother coordinates can be obtained by recalling that the absence of gravita-
tional degrees of freedom implies that even when the particles are separate, the metric
far from them can be written in btz form [12]:

ds2 = n 2 dt2

(52)

the holographic cft is most naturally described in such coordinates, in which the
spacetime boundary is a smooth cylinder. we will construct the colliding particle
spacetime in btz coordinates by performing surgery on an eternal black hole.

it is convenient to begin with an alternative form of the pure btz metric, in which
the spatial sections are identications of the poincare disc [23]. consider global ads
in the coordinates (5) and identify the curves

v :

tanh  sin  =  sin t tanh 

(53)

for   t  0. the resulting spacetime is displayed in fig. 6. at t =  we have the
collapsed geometry associated with the past singularity. as time passes, an einstein-
rosen bridge expands between two asymptotically ads regions. the horizons (thin
dashed lines in fig. 6) come together, meeting at t = /2 in analogy with equal
time slices in four dimensional kruskal coordinates. for t > /2 the einstein-rosen
bridge collapses again to a future singularity as shown in fig. 6.6 we will call these
coordinates btzm, while referring to (52) simply as btz.

we wish to drop two lightlike particles into ads3 at t = /2. matschull has
shown how to present this spacetime in asymptotically btzm coordinates. in fig. 3
each incoming particle was presented with a wedge removed behind its direction

the btzm spacetime ahead of particle b in fig. 7.7 the resulting identication
intersects v at one point. particle a is placed at this point, as shown in fig. 7.
in these coordinates, particle b falls in along the trajectory  = 0, tanh  =  sin t.
near innity, the spatial slices of this collapsing spacetime are identical to those of
the pure btzm black hole in fig. 6.

the coordinate transformation between btzm and btz coordinates is obtained
by relating both to a (2, 2) signature at space in which ads is embedded as a
hyperboloid. this gives

here r+ = 8gm, and the points (t,, ) in btzm correspond to the points

the transformation between com and btz coordinates can be found similarly.
the equal-time slices of the three coordinate systems do not coincide, and those
of com and btzm have kinks at the identications. btz coordinates only cover
the region outside the horizon and are analogous to schwarzschild coordinates for
four dimensional black holes. conveniently for us, the transformations between the

mapped into (t,, ) in another.

5.1.1 detecting particles inside an event horizon

we want to examine families of equal-time propagators as in previous sections to
study the cft representation of black hole formation. as before, consider closed
spacelike boundary curves b(z) satisfying (7) with   z  . cut o the spacetime
at m(t, ) satisfying (9) and dene the associated curves b(z) (10) on the cut-o
boundary. then the length of geodesics between b(z) as m   gives the cft
propagator between b(z).

it is easiest to begin in com coordinates, which we have already studied exten-
sively. prior to the collision at t = 0, we have shown above that geodesics between
b(z) sweep out a bulk surface with two tears in it. one component of this surface
passes in between the two particles. as a result, we have shown that the associated
cft green function has 2 kinks until t = 0 and that these kinks are related to the
positions of the colliding particles. at later times, the colliding particles have formed
a spacelike singularity inside the event horizon, and geodesics can no longer pass
between them. so, as figs. 4d and 4e make clear, there is only one kink in the prop-
agator, arising as the associated bulk geodesics switch between the identications,
avoiding the spacetime singularity. in the com slices with t >   /2, the parti-
cles are localized inside an horizon; yet, we have just showed that their trajectories
aect the cft propagator until they collide. we have reached a remarkable, and
long sought-after [25] conclusion: there are simple quantities in the holographic dual
to ads3 gravity that are sensitive to the details of the matter distribution inside an
event horizon!

the dual cft is most naturally described on the smooth, cylindrical boundary of
conventional btz coordinates {tb, b}. so it is interesting to locate kinks in the cft
green function dened on boundary curves b(z) that coincide with synchronous btz
(52) slices, with the parameter z equated to the btz angle (z = b). it is helpful
to rst examine btzm geodesics running between (te,e, e). for small e the
geodesic will pass behind particle b and miss the identications in fig. 7. for large
e the geodesics will pass behind particle a and through the v identications.
in an intermediate range of angles, the geodesics will pass between the particles and
through the wedge excised from btzm by the particles in fig. 7. following our
previous analyses, geodesics that pass behind b are separated from those that pass
between a and b by the condition

sin te  tanh e cos(  e) = 0.

(55)

we will use (55) to locate kinks in the cft propagator dened on boundary curves
b(z) coinciding with synchronous btz slices.

21

the qualitative form of the answer in the limit where the cuto is removed is clear
from the com discussion of colliding particles. there, (51) gave the location of the
kinks, by separating geodesics that do and do not pass through the identications
in the    limit, this occurs at com = (t  /2)
in fig. 3 and fig. 4c.
and com = (t + /2), if we drop in particles a and b from com = , 0 at
tcom = /2. that is, the associated kinks travel along lightcones. while the
relation between com and btz coordinates is complicated, we expect that in btz
coordinates, the kinks at innity should still travel along lightcones.

to see thisand the form of the kink in the cut-o theory we use the btzm to
btz transformation (54) and (55) to nd the separation condition produced by par-
ticle b for btz geodesics between (teb,eb, reb):

+  1!1/2
  r2

eb
r2

cosh(r+(teb + /2)) =

reb
r+

cosh(r+eb).

(56)

by symmetry the condition for particle a is

+  1!1/2
  r2

eb
r2

cosh(r+(teb + /2)) =

reb
r+

cosh(r+(eb  )).

(57)

when we remove the cuto by taking re  , the logic of previous sections shows
that the cft propagator on the btz cylinder has kinks at b = (t + /2) and
b = (t  /2) as argued above. the kinks move towards each other and meet
when tb = 0 at b = /2.8

as in previous sections, the family of geodesics is sweeping out some bulk surface.
at early times, the surface intersects each particle worldline, producing two cft
kinks. btz coordinates (52) are analogous to 4d schwarzschild coordinates, and only
cover the region outside the event horizon. hence, in these coordinates, we never
see the particles cross the horizon and collide. nevertheless, geodesics between some
(tb,b) must go out of the btz patch and penetrate the horizon, since we know
that geodesics between com boundary points (t,) can penetrate the horizon and
these are mapped onto some (tb,b). the endpoints of the geodesics which do this
are to the past of the merging of cft kinks in btz coordinates. this is possible
because the associated geodesics do not remain at xed time. they can bend into
the future and some of them penetrate the horizon, passing through the btz slices
to the future in the region the post-kink geodesics skip over. the two cft kinks
for t < 0 reect where the surface foliated by the geodesics intersects the particle
worldlines, inside or outside the event horizon. at late btz times, the geodesics no
longer intersect these worldlines. the kink in the cft propagator then arises because
of lensing by the btz geometry  the surface swept out by the associated geodesics

but at a later time.

22

skips over the throat in the geometry, and the resulting tear is responsible for the
cft kink.
if we consider a pair of particles that miss each other and dont form
a black hole, the kinks will approach each other at t = 0 and then separate again,
returning to  = 0,  at t = /2. this will happen because evolution in the gauge
theory is causal, so dierences should only appear in regions that can receive signals
from both particles.

6 discussion

in this paper we have continued an ongoing discussion of the holographic encoding of
semiclassical gravitational backgrounds. we have learned some general lessons about
the holographic ads/cft correspondence. the expectation values of cft operators
contain enough information to completely characterize bulk solutions in a wide variety
of circumstances. however, the relationships between cft expectation values and
radial positions of bulk objects can be complicated. furthermore, localized objects
that are not built out of mode solutions to the supergravity equations will be hard to
characterize using the expectation values of operators dual to supergravity elds.

we argued that non-local cft quantities, such as the propagator, can resolve such
localized objects and, as an example, studied collections of point particles in ads3.
we have shown that although the asymptotic supergravity elds only contain data
about the total mass of the particles, the cft green function is able to enumerate
and locate them. related statements apply to spherical shells in ads5 [19, 20]. in
both of these cases, the localized object in the bulk has co-dimension one. this is why
the bulk geodesics associated with the green function are sucient to characterize it
 the geodesics probe the one extra dimension that is is not occupied by the object,
thereby locating it in that dimension. similarly, we might expect that objects of
co-dimension n can be located in spacetime by transition amplitudes with (n + 1)
particles.

one aim of this paper was to characterize the dierent states of a holographic
theory describing distinct bulk gravity solutions with identical asymptotic elds. we
identied a cft quantity which depends on the bulk solution in the interior, but
the story is far from complete  the propagator probe that we have used is not
ne-grained enough to resolve many questions of interest, particularly in dimensions
higher than 3. we also expect that there will not always be a unique gauge theory
state associated with a classical bulk solution (for example, there should be ea/4 states
associated with a spacetime containing a black hole). our techniques do not shed
additional light on this issue.

in our approach, the process of black hole formation is visible in a reduction in
the number of kinks in cft green functions. remarkably, the cft propagator is
sensitive to the distribution of matter in the interior of an event horizon. in fact, our

23

analysis of the collision to form a black hole does not dier very much from collision
to form a stationary particle, until the singularity forms.

note that the particles we used to form the black hole play a key role in allowing
us to explore its interior; the geodesics that pass between the particles are the ones
that pass behind the horizon. if we consider the pure btz spacetime, none of the
spacelike geodesics between points on one of the boundaries passes inside the black
hole horizon. this should not be a surprise; in the latter case, there is a second
asymptotic region, and the boundary conditions we obtain from the gauge theory on
one boundary are not sucient to determine the spacetime inside the black hole.

this result is very suggestive  from the cft perspective, the view of the black
hole interior as a causally disconnected region with no observable eect on the exterior
is essentially misleading. explicit study of holographic representations of black hole
interiors is an exciting direction for the future.
