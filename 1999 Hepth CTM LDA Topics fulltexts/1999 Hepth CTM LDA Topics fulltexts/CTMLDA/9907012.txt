(1) skip arguments led bekenstein formulate bound stress that, 18 years, counterexample found. so-called holographic principle hooft, susskind others , suggests apparently unrelated holographic bound entropy (hoeb) according entropy cannot exceed one unit per planckian area boundarys surface. formulae: shob = l2 p .
