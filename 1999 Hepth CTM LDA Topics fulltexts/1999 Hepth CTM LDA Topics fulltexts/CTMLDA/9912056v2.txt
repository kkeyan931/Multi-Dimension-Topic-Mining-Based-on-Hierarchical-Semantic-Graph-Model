the kalbramond monopole, as discussed by nepomechie, is identical with the (sin-
gular) dirac monopole in d = 3 dimensions. the latter can be described by the (regular)
t hooftpolyakov monopole, via the t hooft tensor construction. this construction
is extended to arbitrary odd dimensions by performing the d = 5 case explicitly, ex-
ploiting the (regular) monopoles of generalised georgiglashow models and identifying
their t hooft tensors as the kalbramond elds. the relevant magnetic charges are
expressed as topological invariants.

i. introduction

in three euclidean space dimensions, a dirac [1] magnetic monopole is a singular static solution of
u (1) maxwell electromagnetism with nonvanishing magnetic ux over a sphere surrounding the monopole.
diracs original description of such an object involved a stringlike singularity, extending from the location
of the monopole to innity. an important step in the description of the dirac monopole which avoids
the dirac string involves wuyang [2] elds on overlapping coordinate patches (which in mathematical
terms correspond to a nontrivial u (1) bre bundle over s2), but the magnetic eld strength still exhibits
a singularity at the location of the monopole.

thooft [3] showed that the soliton solution of the d = 3 georgiglashow (gg) model, which is known as
t hooftpolyakov monopole, can be interpreted as a regular realisation of the dirac magnetic monopole,
identifying the unbroken u (1) subgroup of the soliton with maxwell magnetism and the topological soliton
charge with magnetic charge. this is done using the t hooft tensor which is identied with the magnetic
u (1) curvature of the t hooftpolyakov [3,4] monopole outside the core. in regular gauge, the thooft
tensor supports a description of the topology and hence the magnetic charge in terms of the higgs eld
only [5], whereas in singular gauge, the thooft tensor restores the wuyang description of the dirac
monopole.

diracs monopole construction in maxwell theory (which is a theory of antisymmetric rank two tensor
eld strengths, i.e. twoforms) was generalised by nepomechie [6] to kalbramond (kr) theory [7] which
itself generalises maxwell theory to higher rank antisymmetric tensor eld strengths. the resulting kr
monopoles in higher dimensions are descibed by singular kr eld strengths, and a wuyang type con-
struction allows the introduction of kr potentials for the monopoles without string singularities. as kr
theory coincides with ordinary maxwell theory in three spatial dimensions, nepomechies construction [6]
really generalises diracs original work to higher dimensions. in fact the kr generalisation of the dirac
monopole to arbitrary dimensions was performed earlier in the context of lattice eld theory by savit [8],
orland [9] and pearson [10]. the motivation of these authors was to construct a dilute instanton gas
in arbitrary dimensionsl abelian models, following previous work of polyakov [11]. the construction of
dilute gases will naturally arise as a possible application of the present work, and will be alluded to in
our discussions.

it is our intention in the present work, to supply regular solitonic realisations of nepomechies kr
monopoles and to generalise the construction of the t hooft tensor to higher dimensions. this is done

concretely for dimension d = 5, in a suciently general framework which points clearly to the systematic
generalisation to all odd dimensions.

to realise our objective, there are two main ingredients needed. the rst is a natural generalisation of
the gg model in higher dimensions, which supports solitonic solutions stabilised by a topological charge.
the second is the construction of a generalisation of the t hooft electromagnetic tensor, which describes
the abelian eld strength to be identied with the higher dimensional kr eld. the rst of these,
namely the generalised gg (ggg) models, are readily obtained by subjecting members of the hierarchy
of yang-mills (ym) models in 4p dimensions [12] to dimensional descent. examples of the resulting higgs
models in various dimensions can be found in refs. [13]. the second, namely the denition of t hooft
tensors in all odd dimensions, is entirely new. we have done this concretely in d = 5, and shown that
such a t hooft tensor can be implemented in odd dimensions only. the construction relies on the proper
denition of the c-p densites that present the lower bounds on the relevant ggg models. these c-p
densities are obtained by subjecting the original chernpontryagin (c-p) densities in 4p dimensions, to
dimensional descent [14].

in section ii, we consider the gauge and higgs elds, along with the gauge group, its representation
and the higgs multiplets, that we need if we are to satisfy the requisite topological properties necessary
for the desired constructions. this includes also a description of the regular and singular (dirac) gauges.
section iii is divided into two subsections. in the rst we discusses the candidates for the generalised
gg models that can be employed, while in the second, the corresponding c-p charge densities descended
from the c-p densities in higher dimensions are discussed. section iv, in which we present the main
results, is divided into three subsections. in the rst, we prove that the c-p charge equals the higgs
eld winding number in regular gauge in all dimensions, and that the c-p charge can be interpreted as
magnetic kr [6] charge in odd dimensions. in the second subsection, we use the dirac gauge to construct
wuyang type kr potentials for the c-s forms and interpret the solitonic solutions to the odd dimensonal
models as regular realisations of kr monopoles. this motivates the nomenclature ggg monopoles for
these regular solutions. in the third subsection we construct the generalised t hooft tensors which we
identify with the kr eld strengths, and show in which sense these t hooft tensors contain the (odd
dimensional) results of the two previous subsections. section v is devoted to a discussion of our results.
in appendix a we give a brief description of kr elds and nepomechies kr monopole constructions in
all dimensions, that is relevant to the present work. in appendix b we list the action/energy functionals
of the four simplest ggg models, as well as the relevant c-p densities and their chernsimons (c-s)
forms.

ii. gauge groups and topology

our primary considerations in this work are the topological properties of gauged higgs systems, and
their relation to kr monopoles in odd dimensions. to this end we set up the topological framework
by selecting the required gauge groups, their representations, as well as the representations of the higgs
elds. irrespective of the detailed dynamics, which is discussed in the next section, we can impose the
nite action/energy conditions which are expected to lead to topologically nontrivial congurations, and
which yield the asymptotic elds. we will discuss these asymptotic elds both in the regular and the
singular (dirac) gauges.

in d euclidean dimensions, we consider a d vector multiplet higgs eld  which we write in isovector

representation

 = d+1

(2.1)

where {1, . . . , d} are the euclidean gamma matrices in d dimensions, and d+1 is an antihermitean
factor. in even dimensions, d = 2m , there exists a chiral matrix 2m+1 = d+1 = i1    2m which
is used as antihermitean factor, 2m+1 = 2m+1, whereas no chiral matrix exists in odd dimensions
d = 2m + 1, and the imaginary unit i is used instead, 2m+2 = i, hence

d+1 :=(cid:26) d+1

i

(d even)
(d odd)

.

(2.2)

the higgs elds under consideration are gauged with so(d) gauge potentials a taking values in the
so(d) algebra with antihermitean generators  =  1

4 [, ],

a = a[]

 dx.

2

(2.3)

boldface letters here denote forms, in components a = adx. the corresponding eld strength is
f = da + a  a = 1

2 f dx  dx .

both higgs and gauge elds can be assumed to be regular on ird, a property wich is not destroyed by

regular gauge transformations given by so(d)valued functions g = exp (r ) on ird with

 7 g := gg1
a 7 ga := gag1 + gdg1 .

(2.4)
(2.5)

physical quantities, in particular the energy functional dening a concrete theory, have to be invariant
under regular gauge transformations.

the existence of an energy functional yields further constraints on the elds considered, because it
involves an integral which has to converge for a given eld conguration. therefore, nite energy con-
gurations are characterised by a particular asymptotic behaviour of the elds (, a). denoting the
r expansion of  and a) by  and a, ap-
asymptotic elds (i.e. the leading terms of an asymptotic 1
propriate nite energy conditions for a large class of models, including those discussed in section iii,
read

2 = 1i
d  := d  + [ a, ] = 0.

(2.6)
(2.7)

conditions (2.6) and (2.7) anticipate the general features of the generalised gg models to be introduced
in subsection iii a below.

if the elds (, a) are regular on ird, then the asymptotic elds labeled by overbars, ( , a), are dened

on sd1, and (2.7) can be solved for asymptotic gauge potential,

d  + [ a, ] = 0  a = 

[ , d ],

1
4

(2.8)

hence the asymptotic congurations in regular gauge are determined by the higgs eld alone which at
innity yields a mapping

 : sd1  sd1 .

(2.9)

therefore, any nite energy conguration in regular gauge can be topologically classied in terms of the
homotopy group

using the (integer) winding number of the (asymptotic) higgs eld

d1(sd1) = zz

1

wd zsd1

tr(cid:2)d+1  d   . . .  d 
}

{z

d1

as topological invariant, where wd is a normalisation constant.

the simplest example with these topological properties are the radially symmetric congurations which

in regular gauge are given by

(p ) = d+1h(r) x,

a(p ) =

1 + f (r)

r

 x dx ,

(2.12)

with x = rx and x2
 = 1. requiring nite energy, the prole functions h and f have to satisfy
h(r  ) = 1, f (r  ) = 0, whereas regularity at the origin means h(0) = 0, f (0) = 1. from a
topological point of view, the particular shape of h(r), f (r) is not important since it does not aect the
asymptotic radially symmetric elds

(p ) = d+1 x,

a(p ) =

1
r

 x dx

as well as the asymptotic eld strength given by

f(p ) = 

1

2r2 (cid:0) + x[] x(cid:1) dx  dx .

3

(2.13)

(2.14)

obviously, interpreted as the mapping

(p ) : sd1  sd1

(2.15)

the asymptotic higgs eld of any radially symmetric conguration (2.12) has winding number 1,
w (d){ (p )} = 1. higher winding number requires ansatze with more involved, e.g. axial, symmetry
properties.

besides the regular gauge transformations discussed so far, there are also singular gauge transformations
which are dened only on some subset of ird, the corresponding gauge transformed elds also being
dened only on that subset and singular on the (generally point or stringlike) complement. those
singular gauge transformations are of particular interest because they allow the transformation of the
elds to the dirac gauge in which the higgs eld always points in the isospace ddirection. in particular,
the asymptotic higgs eld of nite energy congurations trivialises to d+1d in the dirac gauge which
allows the characterisation of two distinct dirac gauges, positive and negative. using this characterisation,
(positive or negative) dirac gauge transformations are regular on

ird

 := ird \ {(0, . . . , 0, x)|x  0}

(2.16)

but singular on either the positive or the negative daxis. therefore, the elds (, a) in positive or
negative dirac gauge are also singular on the negative or positive daxis, respectively, commonly known
as dirac string.

to describe a nite energy conguration (, a) on ird in dirac gauge, one always needs (+, +a)
in positive dirac gauge, dened on ird
+, as well as (, a) in negative dirac gauge, dened on ird
.
both (+, +a) and (, a) have to be gauge equivalent to (, a). it follows that on the overlap of
the positive and negative dirac gauge denition ranges, ird
, there exists a transition gauge
transformation t with

0 := ird

+  ird

t(, a) = (+, +a) .

(2.17)

asymptotically, the trivialisation of the higgs eld in dirac gauge no longer allows one to express the
asymptotic gauge eld in terms of the asymptotic higgs eld since (2.8) requires regularity of the elds on
ird. instead, the nite energy condition (2.7) forces the breaking of the gauge symmetry of the asymptotic
gauge eld according to

d + [a, ] = 0  [a, d] = 0  a =  a[ij]

 ij dx

(2.18)

hence a takes values in the so(d  1) subalgebra of so(d) and is dened on sd1 \ {0, . . . , 0, 1} which
is the d  1 dimensional sphere at innity, excluding the south or north pole, respectively. to describe
the asymptotic gauge elds on sd1, it is sucient to consider a on the upper or lower half spheres
 , respectively, which overlap on the equator sd2 = sd1
sd1
in regular gauges, nite energy congurations could be topologically classied in terms of the asymp-
totic higgs eld winding number w (d){}. in the dirac gauge, the asymptotic higgs elds  = d+1d
do not carry any topological information, but the fact that one needs both positve and negative dirac
gauge to describe a single nite energy conguration now yields the topological characterisation. this
can be be expressed in terms of the asymptotic transition gauge transformation (2.17) which reverses the
sign of the asymptotic higgs eld, hence

+  sd1
 .

t(d+1d) t1 = d+1d  { t, d} = 0.

(2.19)

t takes values in the subset h(d)  so(d) dened by (2.19), h(d) = sd2, and transforms a to +a
on the overlap of their denition ranges which is the equator sd2. this means that t is topologically
equivalent to a mapping

t : sd2  sd2,

(2.20)

which enables the classication of a nite energy conguration in the dirac gauge in terms of the homotopy
group

the explicit expressions (2.25,2.26) show that the gauge group of the asymptotic hedgehog conguration
in dirac gauge breaks down as so(d)  so(d  1), whereas the asymptotic higgs eld (2.24) trivialises.

iii. models and topological charges

in the previous section we selected the gauge group to be so(d) and the representation of the higgs
eld to be the d component vector. this choice was made on topological criteria, including the possibility
of having a dirac gauge. here, we further require that models like these must also support solitonic
solutions which means that the action/energy is bounded from below by a topological charge. in any
given dimension d, there are in principle an innite number of such models, out of which is is reasonable
to select the simplest one. these are all derived from members of the 4p dimensional ym hierarchy [12]
with the gauge eld in one of the two chiral representations of so(4p), whose action density is given by

ll(4p) = tr (ff  . . .  ff)

  (ff  . . .  ff)

(3.1)

where ff is the so(4p) valued 2form gauge eld strength (curvature), and  denotes the hodge dual. as
in 4 dimensions, the action density (3.1) is bounded from below by the 2p-th c-p density cc2p

(3.2)

it is known that when (3.2) is saturated, the resulting selfduality equations have both spherically [15]
and axially [16] symmetric solutions.

the derived d-dimensional gauged higgs models result from the dimensional descent of the inequality

(3.2) over some (4p  d)-dimensional compact coset space k 4pd

zirdk 4pd

ll(4p)  zirdk 4pd

cc2p .

(3.3)

after performing the (compact) integration over the k 4pd coordinates, we are left with the inequality
for the d-dimensional action/energy density of the residual gauged higgs model, bounded from below by
residual c-p density. we will discuss these two quantities in a little more detail in the following two
subsections. before proceeding however, we make two remarks.

firstly, the choice of the compact coset space k 4pd is not important for our purposes since we are
not concerned with the gauge coupling constant explicitly, so we will have in mind the simplest variant
k 4pd = s4pd when discussing the symmetry breaking that occurs in the dimensional descent, and refer
to the corresonding residual models as generalised georgiglashow (ggg) models.

secondly, we will restrict to the simplest of all possible residual system in any dimension d. it is clear
from (3.3) that the descent to d dimensions can start from any dimension 4p > d. the simplest systems
will result, obviously, when 4p is the smallest number that is larger than d. we shall refer to these as
the minimal ggg models. in our considerations below, we will always restrict ourselves to these choices.
familiar examples of such residual models are the three dimensional gg model (in the prasad-somereld
limit) and the abelian higgs model, both descended from so(4) = su (2) p = 1 (i.e. usual) ym1.

a. the generalised gg models and nite energy conditions

having explained the general procedure used in the derivation of residual higgs models above, we now
discuss some properties of minimal ggg systems in d = 2, 3, 4, 5 which are used in the subsequent section.
they arise respectively, from the dimensional reduction of the p = 1, so(4) = su (2) (d = 2, 3), and
the p = 2, so(8) (d = 4, 5), members of the ym hierarchy, and are given explicitly in the appendix
b. we have denoted the energy/action density of the residual models by e (p,d) and will refer to them as
energy densities henceforth, since in the familiar 3 dimensional case this coincides with the denition of
an energy density. we note that the d = 2 model e (1,2) thus obtained is nothing but the usual abelian
higgs model, whereas e (1,3) equals the gg model in the prasadsomereld limit, but we do not make a
distinction on this acount because this limit makes no dierence to our considerations below, the latter
being sensitive only to the asymptotic values rather than the detailed decays of the elds.

an important general feature of the energy densities of these residual models is, that the curvature f,
the covariant derivative of the higgs eld d and the square root of the higgs selnteraction potential
s = (2 + 1i) all must decay asymptotically at the same rate to satisfy nite energy conditions. the
reason for this is easily explained. denoting the curvatures in 4p dimensions that appear in (3.1) with
indices m = , m, with  labeling the coordinates of x  ird and m those of y  s4pd, as a result of the
dimensional reduction we have, for d odd and even respectively,

  y (+)(y) + f()

  y ()(y)
m (y)  d  y ()

m (y)

f = f(+)
fm = d  y (+)
fmn = s+  y (+)

mn (y) + s  y ()

mn (y)

(3.4)

f = f  y (y)
fm = d  ym(y)
fmn = s  ymn(y)

fm n =


, fm n =


where s+ =   1i, s =   1i, and the y s, are y  s4pd dependent tensorspinor bases whose
details do not concern us here (see for example refs. [13] for details). in the even dimensional cases,
the higgs eld , and the gauge potential a are composed of the corresponding elds ,  and a()
(whose curvatures are f()

 ) as follows



a =" a(+)



0

 # ,

0 a()

 =(cid:20) 0 
 0 (cid:21) .

(3.5)

1if by contrast the descent to d = 3 is started from the p = 2 ym, another variant of the gg model is
obtained [17]. its asymptotic properties are identical to those of the usual gg model and hence it yields nothing
new in the present context. we therefore exclude all such models from consideration here.

6

what is interesting here is that the substitution of (3.4) into (3.1), which yields the residual energy
density in d dimensions, results in a sum of terms each of which consists of 2p factors of all possible types
of components listed in (3.4). it follows that each of the elds f , d and (2 + 1i) must have the
same asymptotic decay rate if the energy is to be nite. this means that d and s = (2 + 1i) can be
neglected in asymptotic expansions which justies the conditions (2.6) and (2.7) dening the asymptotic
elds ( , a).

another important property of the models under consideration is that they support nontrivial, stable
nite energy solutions to which we will refer to as solitons in accord with our nomenclature e (p,d) as
energy density. in particular, the radially symmetric ansatz (2.12) minimises the energy functionals, i.e.
the prole functions f (r) and h(r) can be chosen such that they solve the eulerlagrange equations of
the radial subsystem (which in general requires numerical integration techniques). the corresponding
radially symmetric solution is called hedgehog.

b. topological charges of generalised monopoles

under dimensional reduction, the left hand side of (3.3) yields the residual subsystems which are the
candidates for ggg models. the right hand side, which is the dimensionally reduced c-p density, presents
the lower bounds on the ggg energy densities,

the volume integral over this c-p density is called c-p charge q(p,d),

e (p,d)  (p,d) .

q(p,d) =zird

(p,d)ddx .

(3.6)

(3.7)

the normalisation of (p,d) and e (p,d) in (3.6) is chosen such that the hedgehog (2.12) has unit c-p charge.
q(p,d) is commonly also called topological charge of the ggg model e (p,d) since it is closely related to the
topological properties of nite energy congurations discussed in section ii. this is shown in subsection
iv a, making use of the most important property of the c-p densities (p,d), namely that they are total
divergences,

(p,d) = (p,d)



.

(3.8)

this was shown in numerous cases in refs. [14], both for even and odd values of the residual dimensions
d, which we do not exhibit here, except for the four examples discussed in appendix b. (p,d)
is the
residual c-s density and (p,d) = (p,d)
(dx) the residual c-s form which we refer to as the c-s form
pertaining to the model e (p,d), in the sense that it allows us to write the c-p charge (3.7) as a surface
integral over the boundary of ird,





q(p,d) = lim

rzsd1(r)

x(p,d)



ds = lim

rzsd1(r)

(p,d).

(3.9)

we point out that these c-s forms, are gauge invariant in odd, and gauge variant in even, dimensions [14].
this is clearly seen from (b15)(b18) of appendix b. this property of these c-s forms will be very
important in our subsequent considerations.

for use in the next section, we now introduce the asymptotic expressions of c-s forms (p,d) appearing

in (3.9). we denote them, again with an overbar, as

(d) := (p,d)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)( , a)

,

(3.10)

where ( , a) are the asymptotic elds dened in (2.6) and (2.7). we have labeled (d) with the residual
dimension d and not with the label p that species the model, since it does not depend on the latter. this
is because of the general structure of the asymptotic c-s forms which is discussed below. accordingly
the c-p charge, evaluated by the surface integral (3.9), also is independent of p and we express it as

q(d) =zsd1(r)

(d).

7

(3.11)

the asymptotic c-s forms (d) inherit the important property of the (p,d), namely that they are gauge
invariant for odd d and gauge variant for even d. accordingly we treat the two cases separately.

in 2m + 1 (odd) dimensions, the asymptotic c-s forms for the two examples d = 3 and d = 5 which
will be needed below, can be readily extracted from the general c-s forms (b16) and (b18) given in
appendix b, using the nite energy requirements. they are

(3.14)

(3.15)

in general, (p,2m+1) consists of products of f, d and s. as a consequence of the nite energy
conditions, its asymptotic form (2m+1) consists of m factors f and one higgs eld. by virtue of the
identity

then, the asymptotic c-s form in odd dimensions takes the form

tr[d  f  . . .  f

where c2m+1 is a normalisation constant. from eq. (3.15), it is obvious that (2m+1) is gauge invariant.
in 2m (even) dimensions, following similar arguments as before now applied to (b15) and (b17), yield

(3.16)

(3.17)

in (3.16) and (3.17), we have introduced a new symbol (m) used in ref. [19], for m = 1 and m = 2,
because is will be useful in the work of subsequent sections for general m . in general, (p,2m) consists
of products of f, d, s, and of a. as a consequence of the nite energy conditions, its asymptotic form
(2m) consists only of the higgs independent terms, and equals the trace of the chiral so(2m ) matrix
2m+1 times the products of a and f that appear in the trace of the c-s form of the (chiral) so(2m )
yang-mills elds without a higgs eld. using [a, 2m+1] = 0 one can show [19] that this is an exact
form,

tr[2m+1 f  . . .  f

] = d

(m)[a, f] .

(3.18)

m

unlike the corresponding expression (3.15) which can be expressed for all d = 2m + 1, the corresponding
expressions in even dimensions have a more complicated dependence on d = 2m , abbreviated by (m).
these are easy to nd explicitly in any given case and for d = 6 and d = 8 can be found in the rst item
in refs. [14]. one can show that it is this term which contributes the leading asymptotic behaviour of
the c-s form, hence the asymptotic c-s from in even dimensions can be written as

(2m) =

1
c2m

(m)[ a, f] .



(3.19)

eqs. (3.15) and (3.19) show that the asymptotic c-s form really depends on the dimension only and
not on the particular model characterised by p, the member of the ym hierarchy the underlying model
was derived from.

we emphasise that the asymptotic c-s forms in odd dimensions always involve one higgs eld in
addition to an antisymmetric curvature m -form, while in even dimensions the higgs eld is absent and
is replaced by the chiral so(d) matrix.

iv. kalb-ramond fields and t hooft tensors

this section is divided in three subsections. in the rst we evaluate the c-p charge in the regular
gauge identifying it with the winding number of the higgs eld w (d){}, and nding that in odd di-
mensions this gives rise to the description of magnetic kr [6] charge. the second subsection is devoted
to the corresponding considerations in the dirac gauge. there, we have shown that the c-p charge in
even dimensions cannot be evaluated as a surface integral in the dirac gauge, while that is possible in
odd dimensions. it was also shown that the c-p charge results from a surface integral over wu-yang
type kr potentials, and that it can be computed as the degree d(d){t} of the transition gauge transfor-
mation between positive and negative dirac gauges. finally in the third subsection, we have given the
prescription to construct t hooft tensors for all odd dimensional monopoles as a natural extension of the
content of the previous two subsections.

a. regular gauge

the c-p charge can be evaluated directly by simply inserting a eld conguration in regular gauge into
the surface integral (3.11). for the hedgehog eld congurations ((p ), a(p )), (2.12), the asymptotics
(2.13) yield

(d)

(p ) := (p,d)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)( (p ), a

=

rd1 (dx)



zs1

(d)

(p ) = 1 ,

(4.1)

(p ))

in which d1 denotes surface of sd1. this direct evaluation does not, however, demonstrate the
topological nature of the c-p charge, i.e.
its relation to the topological invariants of a nite energy
conguration discussed in section ii.

in regular gauge, a relation between the c-p charge q(d) and the winding number of the higgs eld
w (d){} is easy to nd. using (2.8) to rewrite the asymptotic gauge elds in terms of the asymptotic
higgs elds,

a = 

1
2

d ,

f = 

d   d 

1
4

and inserting (4.2) into (3.12), (3.13), (3.16), (3.17) we nd

by virtue of (4.3)(4.6), the c-p charge q(d) can be identied with the winding number of the higgs eld
dened by (2.11),

q(d) = w (d){},

(4.7)

in both even and odd dimensions. this justies our description of c-p charges as topological charges in
the previous section. we stress that (4.2) is valid in regular gauge only, therefore, eq. (4.7) can not be
used to express the c-p charge in dirac gauge by performing a singular gauge transformation, according
to w (d){} = 0 6= q(d).

because a factor of one higgs eld appears in the odd dimensional asymptotic c-s forms (3.15), it

follows that these are closed forms, namely that

d (2m+1) =

1

c2m+1

tr[ d  f  . . .  f

] = 0 .

we should emphasise that this result follows from the presence in (4.8) of d  which is vanishing asymp-
totically according to (2.7).

in even dimensions however, the expression corresponding to (4.8) is

d (2m) =

which is nonvanishing, i.e. (2m) is not a closed form.

being a closed form, the asymptotic c-s form in 2m + 1 dimensions can be identied with a kalb
ramond eld strength (cf. appendix a) on s2m which supports magnetic ux equal to the c-p charge,
qm = q(2m+1).

this allows us to interpret the c-p charge q(d) solitons of the ggg model with energy density e (p,2m+1)
(e.g. the hedgehog (2.12) with q(d) = 1) as the kr monopole (a11) with magnetic charge qm = q(d). in
other words, we can describe the singular kr monopole eld as the 2m + 1 dimensional (regular) soliton
of the appropriate ggg model.

b. dirac gauge

the situation in dirac gauge is dierent from that in regular gauge in so far as it is not possible to
evaluate the c-p charge in even dimensions using the surface integral (3.11), a fact already emphasised
in ref. [18]. for example, inserting the hedgehog (2.12) into the asymptotic c-s form (2m) yields

zs2m 1

(2m)

(p ) = 0,

(4.10)

is the asymptotic c-s form in the positive or negative dirac gauge for the hedgehog eld

where (2m)
(p )
conguration given by (2.24) and (2.25). this is because of the gauge variance of (2m)
(p ) under the large
gauge transformations (2.23) which take the regular hedgehog to positive or negative dirac gauge. we
will demonstrate this in detail in 2m = 2 and 2m = 4 and will then give the general case.

in 2m = 2 dimensions where

we nd

(2)

(p ) =

1
c2

tr(cid:2)3

a(p )(cid:3)

it turns out that the two terms in (4.12) simply cancel out.

(p ) = (2)

(p ) +

tr(cid:2)3gdg1

 (cid:3) = 0 .

in 2m = 4 dimensions, where

where again the sum of terms in (4.14) cancel out.

finally in general where, with the notation of (3.19)



(2m)
(p ) =

1
c2m



(m)[a(p ), f(p )]

the c-s form in dirac gauge can be rewritten as

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

here, we have used the transformation properties of (m) in the notation of ref. [19]. note that the
general expression (4.16) is exactly of the same form as the special case (4.14) for m = 2, while the
m = 1 case (4.12) is of a simpler form. note also that in (4.16), the exact form d(m)[ a, g] does not
contribute in the surface integral (4.10), in which case the other two terms cancel out.

in odd dimensions on the other hand, the surface integral of (2m+1) over s2m does yield the correct
value for the c-p charge [18], like in the regular gauge.
in this case the asymptotic c-s form of a
nite energy conguration (, a) in dirac gauge, can be given explicitly for the general case. as a
consequence of the asymptotic form of the higgs eld in this gauge,  = i2m+1, and (3.15),

(2m+1) = 

i

c2m+1

tr(cid:2)2m+1

f  . . .  f

(cid:3) .

(4.17)

|

m

{z

}

this quantity is dened on the sphere s2m \ {(0, . . . , 0, 1)} excluding the south or north pole, respec-
tively. as a consequence of the manifest gauge invariance of (4.17),

(2m+1) = (2m+1).

(4.18)

another important property of the c-s forms (2m+1), besides their gauge invariance, is that they
are closed forms. this was used in subsection iv a to interpret them as of kr eld strengths on s2m .
moreover in this case, namely in the dirac gauge, the expression (4.17) makes it possible to express the
kr elds as curls of kr potentials on the simply connected regions s2m
 . following nepomechie [6], we
denote these kr potentials by b(2m+1),

(2m+1) = db(2m+1)

(4.19)

in the notation of appendix b. we will construct these wuyang type kr potentials explicitly in three
and ve dimensions rst and will then present the general case.

in 2m + 1 = 3 dimensions, the gauge group of f breaks down to so(2) by virtue of [3, f] = 0, as

discussed in section ii. we then have

which yields

(3) = 

i
c3

tr(cid:2)3

f(cid:3) =

c3

d tr(cid:2)3

b(3) = 

i
c3

tr(cid:2)3

a(cid:3) .

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.24)

in 2m + 1 = 5 dimensions, f has so(4) gauge symmetry by virtue of [5, f] = 0, from which it follows
that

(5) = 

i
c5

tr(cid:2)5

f  f(cid:3) = 

i
c5

d tr(cid:20)5(cid:18)f  a

thus

b(5) =

tr(cid:20)5(cid:18)f  a

3

a  a  a(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(4.22)

(4.23)

we now note that the forms on the right hand sides of (4.20) and (4.22) coincide with the forms (1)
and (2) in the corresponding even dimensional (d = 2, 4) cases (3.16) and (3.17). in general 2m + 1
dimensions, f is a so(2m ) gauge eld strength according to (2.18). this enables us to write the kr
potentials of the asymptotic c-s forms in general 2m + 1 dimensions with the help of (m) (which was
used in (3.19) in the context of even dimensional c-s forms) as follows

b(2m+1) = 

i



c2m+1

(m)(cid:2)a, f(cid:3) .

the kr potentials b(2m+1) can be used to rewrite the c-p charge surface integral corresponding
to (3.11), over s2m , as an integral over the equator s2m 1. first splitting the integral (3.11) into two
integrals over the upper and lower half spheres s2m
 , respectively, one can use the gauge invariance of

11

the odd dimensional c-s forms, (4.18), to evaluate the c-p charge q(2m+1) without integrating over the
singularities in the dirac gauge. finally, using the kr potentials (4.19) and applying stokes theorem
on s2m

 = s2m 1 yields

+ = s2m

q(2m+1) =zs2m

+

+(2m+1) +zs2m



(2m+1) =zs2m 1(cid:16)+b(2m+1)  b(2m+1)(cid:17)

according to the discussion in appendix a 2, the integral over the transition form

u(2m+1) = +b(2m+1)  b(2m+1)

(4.25)

(4.26)

in (4.25) determines the kr magnetic charge of the the wuyang type kr potentials b(2m+1) which
enables us again to identify the c-p charge q(2m+1) with magnetic kr charge qm.

in the context of the ggg models, the transition form u(2m+1) is a composite eld which can be
written explicitly in terms of the asymptotic gauge potentials a and the asymptotic transition gauge
transformation t which takes the negative to the positive dirac gauge, t(, a) = (+, +a). again, we
rst present this result in the three and ve dimensional case, giving the general odd dimensional result
afterwards.

in three dimensions, using { t, 3} = 0, (2.19), we nd

+b(3) =

i
c3

trh3

t(cid:0)a(cid:1)i = b(3) +

i
c3

tr(cid:2)3 td t1(cid:3) ,

yielding u(3) = i
c3

tr(cid:2)3 td t1(cid:3). substituting this into the equatorial integral (4.25) leads to

in ve dimensions we nd in the same way, using {5, t} = 0,

q(3) =

i

c3 zs1

tr(cid:2)3 td t1(cid:3) .
tr(cid:2)5(cid:0) td t1(cid:1) (cid:0) td t1(cid:1) (cid:0) td t1(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:27) .

u(5) =

i

c5 (cid:26)d tr(cid:2)

5

a  d t1(cid:3) 

1
3

substituting this into the equatorial (closed surface) integral (4.25), by stokes theorem the rst term in
(4.29) does not contribute and the rest yields

q(5) = 

i

3c3zs3

tr(cid:2)5(cid:0) td t1(cid:1) (cid:0) td t1(cid:1) (cid:0) td t1(cid:1)(cid:3) .

the ve dimensional example already shows the structure of the general case. using the same notations

(m) and (m) introduced in (4.16) but taking care of the anticommutator{2m+1, t} = 0,

u(2m+1) =

i

c2m+1 nd

(m)(cid:2)a, t(cid:3) + 

(m)(cid:2) td t1, 0(cid:3)o .

substituting this into the equatorial integral (4.25), in which the term d(m)(cid:2)a, t(cid:3) does not contribute,

we can write the c-p charge in the general case as

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

(4.31)

(4.32)

q(2m+1) =

i

c2m+1 zs2m 1



(m)(cid:2) td t1, 0(cid:3) .

finally, we see that the c-p charges (4.28) and (4.30) equal, respectively, the degrees of the transition
gauge transformations (2.22), in three and ve dimensions. in the general case with q(2m+1) given by
(4.32), we have

q(2m+1) = d(2m+1){t} .

(4.33)

c. construction of the t hooft tensor

in this subsection, we give the prescription for constructing t hooft tensors [3,5] pertaining to the
ggg monopoles, in all odd dimensions. this encapsulates the results of both previous subsections iv
a and iv b simultaneously.
in three dimensions, the t hooft tensor is identied with the residual
maxwell eld of the dirac monopole. in general odd dimensions, the dirac monopole generalises to kr
monopoles described in terms of kr elds (which coincide with maxwell elds in d = 3 dimensions). the
construction of thooft tensors in higher dimensions then follows naturally.

we rst repeat the construction in three dimensions, using the notation developed above and pointing
out the main steps as a guideline for the ve dimensional case presented subsequently. this construction
can be systematically extended to all odd dimensions.

in three dimensions, the asymptotic c-s form (3.12) can be written as

(3) =

1
c3

tr(cid:2)  f(cid:3) =

1
c3

tr(cid:2) (cid:0)d a + a  a(cid:1)(cid:3)

the plan now is to add an asymptotically vanishing, gauge invariant, expression which cancels the second
(highest order in as) term in (4.34), such that the result consists of an exact form plus a term depending
on the higgs elds only. to be concrete, one can check the identity

0 = tr(cid:2)  d   d (cid:3) = tr(cid:2) (cid:0)d   d  + 4 a  a(cid:1)  4d   a(cid:3)

which is asymptotically zero by virtue of d  = 0. multiplying the identity (4.35) by the normalisation
factor (4c3)1, and adding this to the asymptotic c-s form (4.34), we have the desired denition of the
usual t hooft tensor

(4.34)

(4.35)

(4.36)

(4.37)

(4.38)

h(3) := (3)

tr(cid:2) d   d (cid:3)

with

b(3) =

1
c3

tr(cid:2)  a(cid:3) .

in the denition equation (4.37), we have used the symbol h(3) for the t hooft tensor, which is also
the symbol for the kr eld strength introduced in appendix a. this is because (3) on the left hand
side of (4.34) describes both these quantities, and the t hooft tensor can be identied with the kr eld
strength. the c-p charge now equals the surface integral of this kr eld strength h(3), which by virue
of (a9), denes magnetic kr charge,

q(3) =zs2

(3) =zs2

h(3) := qm .

(4.39)

in the regular gauge, where the surface integral is over the entire (closed) s2, the term db(3) in (4.37)

does not contribute. it follows that the only contribution comes from the second term

q(3) =zs2

h(3) = 

1

4c3zs2

tr(cid:2) d   d (cid:3) = w (3)[] .

this reproduces the result (4.7) of subsection iv a in three dimensions.

(4.40)

in the dirac gauge, the surface integral is carried out over the sphere with a hole around the negative
or positive (south or north) dirac string singularity, and the higgs eld is a constant. as a consequence of

the constancy of the higgs eld, the term tr(cid:2) d   d (cid:3) in (4.37) vanishes so that the only contribution

to the surface integral comes from the residue of the singularity in the rst term. this is the (closed s1)
line integral of

b(3)(cid:12)(cid:12)(,a) = 

i
c3

tr(cid:2)3

a(cid:3) = b(3) ,

13

(4.41)

in the notation of (4.21). here b(3) are the kr potentials of the kr eld strength h(3) = db(3) on
s2

. this reproduces the results of subsection iv b.
in ve dimensions, the asymptotic c-s form (3.13) can be written as

(5) =

c(5)

c(5)

tr(cid:0)  f  f(cid:1)
tr(cid:2) (cid:0)d a  d a + d a  a  a + a  a  d a + a  a  a  a(cid:1)(cid:3) .

(4.42)

as in the three dimensional case, the plan now is to add an asymptotically vanishing, gauge invariant,
expression which cancels the fourth (highest order in as) term in (4.42), such that the result consists
of an exact form plus a term depending on the higgs elds only. unlike in the three dimensional case

it only remains to nd the relative numerical
coecients of these two terms, such that they result in the elimination of the said term. to be concrete,
one can check the identity

where there is only one such candidate, c.f. tr(cid:2)  d   d (cid:3) in eq. (4.35), now there are two, namely
tr(cid:2)  d   d   d   d (cid:3) and tr(cid:2)  f  d   d (cid:3).
0 = tr(cid:2) (cid:0) d   d   8 f(cid:1)  d   d (cid:3) = tr(cid:2) d   d   d   d (cid:3)  16 tr(cid:2)  a  a  a  a(cid:3)

+ 8 tr(cid:2)d (cid:0)d a  a + a  d a + a  a  a(cid:1)(cid:3) .

multiplying the identity (4.43) by the normalisation factor (16c3)1, and adding this to the asymptotic
c-s form (4.42), we have the denition of the t hooft tensor in ve dimensions,

again, we have used the symbol h(3) in the denition equation (4.37) which is also the symbol for the
kr eld strength introduced in appendix a, dening the kr eld strength describing the monopoles
of the ggg models as the t hooft tensor (4.45). the c-p charge then is the surface integral of the kr
eld strength h(5) over s4 in analogy to (4.39),

q(5) =zs4

(5) =zs4

h(5) = qm .

(4.47)

in the regular gauge, where the surface integral is over the entire (closed) s4, the term db(5) in (4.45)

does not contribute. it follows that the only contribution comes from the second term

q(5) =zs4

h(5) =

1

16c5zs4

tr(cid:2) d   d   d   d (cid:3) = w (5)[] .

this reproduces the result (4.7) of subsection iv a in ve dimensions.

(4.48)

in the dirac gauge, the surface integral is carried out over the sphere with a hole around the negative
or positive (southor north) dirac string singularity, and the higgs eld is a constant. as a consequence

of the constancy of the higgs eld, the term tr(cid:2) d   d   d   d (cid:3) in (4.45) vanishes so that the only

contribution to the surface integral comes from the residue of the singularity in the rst term. this is
the (closed s3) integral of

in the notation of (4.23). b(5) are the kr potentials of the kr eld strength h(5) = db(5) on s4

this reproduces the result of subsection iv b.

it is now clear that the prescription for the construction of the t hooft tensor in three and ve
dimensions can be systematically extended to any odd dimension. the result can be stated formally,
omitting the expression corresponding to (4.36) and (4.44) in the denitions of the t hooft tensors, and
restricting to the result corresponding to (4.37) and (4.45). it is

v. summary and discussion

we have studied the topological properties of the solitons of the generalised georgiglashow (ggg)
models, which we have described along with the corresponding reduced chernpontryagin (c-p) densities
and chernsimons (c-s) forms in the regular and the the dirac gauges, in all dimensions. in common
with the familiar three dimensional case, the topology of these monopoles can be described exclusively
by the so(d) isovector higgs elds in the regular gauge, identifying the c-p charge with the higgs eld
winding number. all this was carried out in all, even and odd, dimensions.

just as the magnetic maxwell eld, which is the reduced c-s form pertaining to the monopole of the
three dimensional gg model, can be identied as the dirac monopole eld strength, we have identied
the reduced c-s forms, descended from higher order c-p densities, as the kalbramond (kr) monopole
elds of nepomechie [6] in all odd dimensions. the role analogous to that of the t hooftpolyakov
monopole is played by the solitons of the ggg models, which we have called ggg monopoles. this
construction is not possible in even dimensions.

just as in the three dimensional case, the study of the ggg monopoles and the corresping c-s forms,
both in the regular and dirac gauges, led us to dene the t hooft tensors in all odd dimensions. these
are identied with the relevant kr eld strengths of the ggg monopoles. all our concrete constructions
were carried out using the hedgehog (spherically symmetric) ggg monopoles in three and ve dimensions,
but the results hold generally.

we now discuss briey, connections of our results with physically relevant problems.
the rst is concerned with the construction of dilute gases of ggg monopoles. kr theory is linear
in the sense that the sum of two solutions is again a solution to the kr equations (a2) and (a8). this
allows the construction of a dilute gas of kr monopoles in analogy to the coulomb gas in usual maxwell
theory. this coulomb gas was used in polyakovs work [11] to construct a dilute gas of t hooftpolyakov
monopoles of the usual gg model in three dimensions, yielding a mechanism for connement in the
resulting qcd toy model. one can thus expect that polyakovs construction can be adopted to the
ggg models in odd dimensions, but unfortunately not in even dimensions  and particularly not in
the physically interesting case d = 4, where the signicance of the ggg model e (2,4) has recently been
pointed out [20].

perhaps of most topical interest is the relevance of our results to the modern concept of branes.
in usual maxwell theory, the elementary electrically charged objects are pointlike (zero dimensional),
and their time evolution is described by a worldline. the maxwell potential describing a magnetic
eld, on the other hand, is a 1form which can be integrated along the worldline of the electric charge.
this line integral, multiplied by the electric charge coupling constant e, yields the interaction energy
(or, in minkowskian spacetime, action) between the electric charge and the maxwell magnetic eld.
generalising this construction to higher dimensions, the electrically charged objects which couple to d  2
form kr potentials must have a d  2 dimensional worldvolume such that the interaction between the
electrically charged object and the kr eld is described as the integral of the kr potential over this
world volume. this means that the electrically charged object itself is a d  3 brane. nepomechie [6] has

15

shown that the existence of a kr monopoles with magnetic charge qm leads to a quantisation condition
for the electric charge of the branes which couple to the kr monopole eld in the way described above.
therefore the ggg monopoles in 2m + 1 dimensions which we have discussed yield the quantisation of
the elementary electric charge of 2m  2 branes in analogy to the t hooftpolyakov monopole which
forces the quantisation of elementary electric point charges (which are 0branes). kr elds, on the other
hand, arise naturally in the context of string theories [7] which are the background of all modern brane
physics, so that we expect strings and d-branes to be the correct context in which our constructions may
be of some signicance.

finally, we discuss a generalisation of the ggg monopoles used in this work.
the dynamics of the systems studied was described by the so-called ggg models, and in particular
the solitons they support in odd spatial dimensions are the ggg monopoles alluded to above. these
ggg monopoles are the classical solutions to the eulerlagrange equations in the temporal gauge a0 =
0. when the odd spatial dimensions are restricted to d = 4m  1, the ggg monopoles are in fact
solutions to the relevant rst order bogomolnyi or selfduality equations. these were discussed in
ref. [21] and the analytic proof of existence given in ref. [22]. these selfdual ggg monopoles, which are
generalisations of the bps monopoles in three (m = 1) dimensions, are entirely suited for generalisation
to the corresponding dyons following the prescription used by julia and zee [23] in the m = 1 case.
this task can be performed systematically and will be reported elsewhere. the question here is, whether
such dyons can be described as kr elds?

appendix a: kalbramond theory and magnetic monopoles

in this appendix, we summarise the theory of static kalbramond (kr) elds and kr monopoles,

following nepomechie [6].

1. free kr theory

kalbramond (kr) theories [7] generalise maxwell electromagnetism as they deal with higherrank
antisymmetric tensor eld strength instead of the rank two mawxwell eld strength tensor. in mathemat-
ical terminology, kr eld strengths are real valued rforms in d + 1 minkowskian spacetime dimensions.
static kr theory involving rforms on d dimensional space ird then, generalises maxwell magnetostatics.
here, we consider the special case r = d  1 in d spatial dimensions and simply refer to this special
case of magnetic kr theories as the kr theory in d dimensions since it is this type of magnetic kr
theory which we consider in the main part of this work. it is dened in terms of the magnetic kr eld
strength (d  1)form

h =

1

(d  1)!

h1...d1dx1  . . .  dxd1 = h(dx), h1...d1 := 1...d1

h

(a1)

which is closed on ird,

dh = 0  1...d 1

h2...d = 0   h = 0.

poincares lemma then allows to introduce the kr potential (d  2)form

b =

1

(d  2)!

b1...d2 =

b1...d2dx1  . . .  dxd2 =

1
2

b12  (dx1  dx2 ),

such that

h = db



h1...d1 = [1

b

2...d1]



h =  b .

(a2)

(a3)

(a4)

16

b is well dened up to an exact (d  2)form d,

 =

1

(d  3)!

1...d3 =

1...d3 dx1  . . .  dxd3 =

1
3!

123  (dx1  dx2  dx3 ),

1
3!

1...d3123

123

(a5)

which means that h is invariant under kr transformations

b 7 b + d  b1...d2 7 b1...d2 + [1 2...d2]  b12 7 b12 +  12

(a6)

and a kr energy functional is supposed to preserve this invariance.

free kr theory is given by the energy functional

e(d)

kr[h] :=

1

2zird

h  h :=

1

2(d  1)!zird

h2

1...d1 =

1

2zird

h

2
.

varying e(d)

kr with respect to b yields the magnetic kr equation

 dh = 0   h1...d2 = 0  [1

h

2] = 0.

(a7)

(a8)

eqs. (a2) and(a8) are the ddimensional generalisation of the magnetic maxwell equations in d = 3
space dimensions.

2. kr monopoles in d dimensions

assuming the existence of magnetic charges changes the mathematical structure of kr theory. from
the analog of maxwell magnetostatics, the ux of the magnetic kr eld strength form through the sphere
sd1 equals a magnetic kr charge qm,

qm =zsd1

h.

(a9)

since sd1 is not simply connected, dh = 0 does not enforce the existence of a global kr potential form.
however, on the simply connected upper and lower half spheres sd1
  sd1, kr potential forms
= db. in order to yield a welldened eld strength form h, the potential forms +b and
exist, h|sd1
b on the overlap of their denition ranges, i.e. the equator sd1
 = sd2, dier by a transition
form u = +b|sd2  b|sd2 which has to be closed, du = 0. the magnetic kr charge is determined by
u,

+  sd1

+ , sd1



u.

(a10)

qm =zsd1

h =zsd1

+

d+b +zsd1



db =zsd2(cid:0)+b  b(cid:1) =zsd2

in analogy to the corresponding construction for the dirac monopole, eq. (a10) can be called the wu
yang construction for magnetic kr charge. the crucial point in the construction is that u is not exact
on the equator sd2 although it is closed.

an actual solution h(p ) of the kr equations (a2) and (a8) on sd1 with nonvanishing ux (a9) is

called a (magnetic) kr monopole. one can show [6,24] that the only such solution is given by

h(p ) =

qm
d1

x
rd1 (dx).

(a11)

with h(p ) = db(p ) on sd1
 , respectively. the explicit expressions for b(p ), which do not concern us
here, are given in ref. [6]. interpreting this as (d  1)form on ird in distributional sense (i.e. including
the singularity at the origin) and using

yields

(cid:18) x

rd1(cid:19) = d1(x)

dh(p ) = qm(x)(1),

i.e. eq. (a2) is modied by a point charge acting as source for the kr eld strength.

appendix b: minimal generalised georgiglashow models in d = 2, 3, 4, 5

dimensions

in this appendix we give the explicit expression for the energy densities, c-p densities and c-s densi-

ties/forms of the minimal ggg models in d = 2, 3, 4, 5 dimensions.

c(p,d) > 0 are normalisation constants to be discussed below.

the corresponding residual c-p densities (p,d)  e (p,d) are found to be

(b8)

the volume integral (3.7) of the c-p densities yields the c-p charge q(p,d). it is usual to choose the
normalisation constants c(p,d) such that the hedgehog (2.12) has unit topological charge.

the c-p charges can be written as total divergences of the c-s densities (p,d)

the corresponding explicit expressions for the c-s densities are

note that in the d = 2 formulas (b1),(b5) and (b10), the gauge eld a = ia3 is abelian, and
the higgs eld then has only two components as seen from (2.1), or alternatively can be parametrised by
a single complex eld  in (3.5). it is then obvious that (b1) pertains to the usual abelian higgs model.
finally, we give the explicit expressions for the c-s forms (p,d) of the four minimal ggg models
(b1)(b4) in the language of dierential forms used in this work. they are dened as hodge duals of the
c-s density 1forms with components (p,d)
