compared interaction point particles two particles come arbitrarily close together, interaction strings spread out, thus many divergencies ordinary quantum eld theory absent. unlike point particles, string internal degrees freedom describe dierent ways vibrate ambient space-time. dierent vibrational modes interpreted particles theory particular, whole particle spectrum theory determined terms one fundamental object. vibrations string easily described point view so-called world-sheet, two-dimensional surface string sweeps propagates space-time; fact, theory world-sheet vibrations string described conformal eld theory. closed string theory, oscillations string decomposed two waves move opposite directions around loop. two waves essentially independent other, theory therefore factorises two so- called chiral conformal eld theories. many properties local theory studied separately two chiral theories, shall therefore mainly analyse chiral theory article. main advantage approach chiral theory studied using powerful tools complex analysis since correlation functions analytic functions. chiral theories also play crucial role conformal eld theories dened manifolds boundaries, relevant conformal field theory description open string theory. 4 known consistent string theories obtained compactication rather small number theories. include dierent supersymmetric string theories ten dimensions, well number non-supersymmetric theories dened either ten twenty-six dimensions. recent advances string theory centered around idea duality, namely theories related sense strong coupling regime one theory described weak coupling regime another. crucial element developments realisation solitonic objects dene relevant degrees freedom strong coupling dirichlet-branes alternative description terms open string theory {$9510017$}. fact, eect dirichlet brane completely described adding certain open string sectors (whose end-points xed lie world-volume brane) theory. possible dirichlet branes given string theory selected condition resulting theory open closed strings must consistent. consistency conditions contain (and may equivalent to) consistency conditions conformal eld theory manifold boundary . much structure theory shall explain review article directly relevant analysis questions, although shall discuss actual consistency conditions (and solutions) here. review article well-developed subject conformal eld theory miss important elements theory, article exception. chosen present one coherent route section theory shall discuss detail alternative view points subject. approach taken essence algebraic (although shall touch upon questions analysis), inspired work goddard  well mathematical theory vertex operator algebras developed borcherds , frenkel, lepowsky & meurman , frenkel, huang & lepowsky , zhu , kac {$9510017$} others. algebraic approach fairly familiar many physicists, tried give somewhat new slant emphasising fundamental role amplitudes. also tried explain recent developments mathematical theory vertex operator algebras far widely appreciated physics community, particular, work zhu. exist essence two view points subject: functional analytic approach techniques algebraic quantum eld theory  employed pioneered wassermann  gabbiani frohlich ;

(24) conventional quantum eld theory, states theory transform suitable way poincare group, amplitudes therefore covariant poincare transformations. present context, role poincare group played group mobius transformations m, i.e. group (complex) automorphisms riemann sphere. transformations form a, b, c, c , ad bc = 1 . (25) az + b cz + associate element z 7 (z) = , = b c ! sl(2,c) , (26) (28) (29) mobius transformation (25), since sl(2,c) sl(2,c) dene mobius transformation, group mobius transformations isomorphic = sl(2,c)/z2. following shall sometimes use elements sl(2,c) denote corresponding elements confusion result. convenient introduce set generators el1(z) = z + , el0(z) = ez, el1(z) = z 1 z , (27) rst transformation translation, second scaling, last one usually referred special conformal transformation. every mobius transformation obtained composition transformations, mobius transformations 6= 0, compactly described = exp(cid:20) b 0 1 ! , el1 = 1 c l1(cid:21) d2l0 exph el0 = e 0 e 1 l1i , 2 ! , 1 2 0 el1 = 1 1 ! . 0 given (25). terms sl(2,c), three transformations (27) corresponding innitesimal generators (that complex 2 2 matrices vanishing trace) l1 = 0 1 0 0 ! , l0 = 1 0 2 0 1 2 ! , l1 = 0 1 0 ! . 0 (30) conformal field theory 12 form basis lie algebra sl(2,c) sl(2,c), satisfy commutation relations  = (m n)lm+n, m, n = 0, 1 . (31) conventional quantum eld theory, states meromorphic theory form representation algebra decomposed irreducible representations. (irreducible) representations relevant physics satisfy condition positive energy. present context, since l0 (the operator associated l0) identied energy operator (up constant), representations spectrum l0 bounded below. follow cluster property amplitudes discussed below. given irreducible highest weight representation, let us denote state l0 takes minimal value, h say.k using (31) l0l1 =  + hl1 = (h 1)l1 , (32) ln denotes operator corresponding ln. since state minimal value l0, follows l1 = 0; states property l1 = 0 l0 = h (33) called quasiprimary, real number h called conformal weight . every quasiprimary state generates representation sl(2,c) consists l1-descendants (of ), i.e. states form ln 1 n = 0, 1, . . .. innite-dimensional representation irreducible unless h non-positive half-integer. indeed, l1ln 1 = 1ln1l 1 n1xl=0 n1xl=0 = 2 (h + n 1 l)ln1 1 = 2n(h + (n 1))ln1 1 , 1 2 (34) (35) (36) thus h non-positive half-integer, state ln 1 n = 1 2h l1- descendants dene subrepresentation. order obtain irreducible representation one quotient space l1-descendants subrepresentation; resulting irreducible representation nite-dimensional. since states theory carry representation mobius group, amplitudes transform covariantly mobius transformations. transformation rule general states quite complicated (we shall give explicit formula later on), quasiprimary states easily described: let i, = 1, . . . , n n quasiprimary states conformal weights hi, = 1, . . . , n, h nyi=1 dzi (cid:19)hi nyi=1(cid:18) d(zi) h nyi=1 v (i, zi)i = v (i, (zi))i , (37) k shall assume one state; representations. always true irreducible conformal field theory 13 mobius transformation (25). let us denote operators implement mobius transformations space states symbols (27) ln replaced ln. transformation formulae vertex operators given el1v (, z)el1 = v (, z + ) = xh v (, xz) xl0 v (, z)xl0 el1v (, z)el1 = (1 z)2hv (, z/(1 z)) , quasiprimary conformal weight h. also write generally given formula (28). notation =(cid:16)(z)(cid:17)h v(cid:16), (z)(cid:17) , dv (, z)d1 = (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) ; equivalent ln = 0 n = 0, 1. transformation formula vertex operator associated quasiprimary eld consistent identication states elds (24) denition quasiprimary state (33): indeed, apply (39) (40) vacuum, use (42) set z = 0, obtain xl0 = xh el1 = (43) implies l1 = 0 l0 = h, thus agreement (33). mobius symmetry constrains functional form amplitudes, case one-, two- three-point functions actually determines functional dependence completely. quasiprimary state conformal weight h, hv (, z)i independent z translation symmetry, follows (39) hv (, z)i = hhv (, z)i . (44) one-point function therefore non-zero h = 0. assumption cluster property discussed next subsection, state h = 0 vacuum, = . two quasiprimary states conformal weights h h, respectively, translation symmetry implies hv (, z)v (, )i = hv (, z )v (, 0)i = f (z ) , scaling symmetry gives h+hf (x) = f (x) , f (x) = cxhh , (45) (46) (47) c constant. hand, symmetry special conformal transformations implies hv (, x)v (, 0)i = (1 x)2hhv (, x/(1 x))v (, 0)i , (48) conformal field theory 14 therefore, upon comparison (47), amplitude non-trivial 2h = h + h, i.e. h = h. case amplitude form hv (, z)v (, )i = c(z )2h . (49) amplitude non-trivial = , locality condition implies h z bosonic eld, h 1 2 + z fermionic. familiar spin-statistics theorem. finally, quasiprimary elds conformal weights hi, = 1, 2, 3, hv (1, z1)v (2, z2)v (3, z3)i =yi<j(cid:18)ai aj zi zj(cid:19)hij hv (1, a1)v (2, a2)v (3, a3)i , (50) h12 = h1 + h2 h3, etc., ai three distinct arbitrary constants. deriving (50) used fact every three points mapped three points means mobius transformation. 3.2. uniqueness theorem follows directly (38), (42) (24) v (, z) = ezl1v (, 0) = ezl1 . (51) v (, z) addition local, i.e. satises (19) every , v (, z) uniquely characterised property; content uniqueness theorem : u(z) local vertex operator satises u(z) = ezl1 u(z) = v (, z) dense subspace h0. proof: let f0 arbitrary. (52) (53) u(z) = u(z)v (, 0) = ,v (, 0)u(z) = ,v (, 0)ezl1 , (54) used locality u(z) (52) , denotes sign (19). use (51) locality v (, z) rewrite ,v (, 0)ezl1 = ,v (, 0)v (, z) = v (, z)v (, 0) = v (, z) , (55) thus action u(z) v (, z) agrees dense subspace f0. given uniqueness theorem, deduce transformation property general vertex operator mobius transformations dv (, z)d1 = v "(cid:18)d dz(cid:19)l0 exp(cid:18) (z) 2(z) l1(cid:19) , (z)# .

(60) (61) (62) (63) quasiprimary conformal weight h, last three equations compactly written  = zn(cid:26)z dz + (n + 1)h(cid:27) v (, z) finally, applying (61) vacuum ezl1l1 = ezl1 dv dz (, 0) , implies, using uniqueness theorem, n = 0, 1. (64) (65) (, z) = v (l1, z) . dv dz particular, follows correlation functions l1-descendants quasi- primary states directly deduced involve quasiprimary states themselves. (66) conformal field theory 16 3.3. factorisation cluster property explained above, meromorphic conformal eld theory determined space states h0 together set amplitudes dened arbitrary elements dense subspace f0 h0. amplitudes contain relevant information vertex operators; example locality mobius transformation properties vertex operators follow corresponding properties amplitudes (21), (37). practice, however good way dene conformal eld theory, since h0 always innite-dimensional (unless meromorphic conformal eld theory consists vacuum), unwieldy give correlation functions arbitrary combinations elements innite-dimensional (dense) subspace f0 h0.

(182) local theory specied terms space states set amplitudes involving arbitrary states fff hhh. meromorphic subtheory analysed describes amplitudes involve states f0. similarly, anti- meromorphic subtheory describes amplitudes involve states f 0. since two meromorphic theories commute, general amplitude involving states f0 f 0 simply product corresponding meromorphic anti- meromorphic amplitude. (indeed, product meromorphic anti- meromorphic amplitude poles original amplitude.) theory factorises (182), one summands (8) completion f0 f 0, denote hhh(0,0). general amplitude theory contains states dierent sectors hhh(j,). since hhh(j,) representation two vertex operator algebras, use operator product expansion (5) rewrite given amplitude terms amplitudes involve states hhh(0,0). therefore useful call amplitude n-point function involves n states sectors hhh(0,0) arbitrary number states hhh(0,0). general, amplitude expressed sum products chiral amplitude, i.e. amplitude depends zi, anti-chiral amplitude, i.e. one depends zi. however, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, sum contains one term since functional form relevant chiral (and anti-chiral) amplitudes uniquely determined mobius symmetry. zero-point functions simply products meromorphic amplitudes, one-point functions vanish. two-point functions usually non-trivial, dene, essence, dierent representations meromorphic anti- meromorphic subtheory present theory. since amplitudes factorise chiral anti-chiral amplitudes, one analyse separately; chiral amplitudes dene representation meromorphic subtheory. conformal field theory 4.1. highest weight representations 36 representation meromorphic conformal eld theory dened collection amplitudes (w)v (1, z1) v (n, zn)(u)e , two xed elds (that describe generating eld representation conjugate), quasiprimary elds meromorphic conformal eld theory. amplitudes (183) analytic functions variables transform covariantly mobius transformations (37) (183) (184) (w)v (1, z1) v (n, zn)(u)e dw (cid:19)h(cid:18) d(u) ((w))v (1, (z1)) v (n, (zn))((u))e , du (cid:19)h nyi=1(cid:18) d(zi) dzi (cid:19)hi =(cid:18) d(w) hi conformal weight i, call h h conformal weights , respectively. since meromorphic elds, h h general half-integer, amplitudes typically branched u = w. mobius symmetry always map two points u w 0 , respectively (for example considering mobius transformation (z) = zu zw ), shall always so. case shall write (0)i = |i. case w = situation slightly subtle since (183) behaves w2h w ; therefore dene h | = lim w w2hh (w) .

(187) explained section 3.4, commutation relations modes (90) derived operator product expansion corresponding elds. since representation amplitudes (183) preserve sense (186), follows action modes states form (187) also respects (90), least null-states vanish amplitudes. thus dene fock space f quotient space space states generated (187), identify states whose dierence vanishes amplitudes, f carries representation lie algebra modes (of meromorphic elds). following shall consider untwisted representations, one important case twisted representations, so-called ramond sector fermionic algebra, mentioned since analysed similar methods. case bosonic elds single-valued z encircles origin, fermionic elds pick minus sign. possible expand meromorphic elds modes, bosonic elds treated before, fermionic eld vr()zrh r-sector fermionic . (188) v (, z) =xrz using methods before, deduce commutation (and anti- commutation) relations modes operator product expansion elds meromorphic conformal eld theory, fock space r-sector representations forms representation lie algebra. indeed, actual form commutation anti-commutation relations except fermionic elds integer mode number. example, commutation relations r-sector n = 1 superconformal algebra  = (m n)lm+n + m(m2 1)m,n c 12  = (cid:16) 2 {gr, gs} = 2lr+s + r(cid:17) gm+r 3(cid:18)r2 c 1 4(cid:19) r,s , (189) strictly speaking, underlying vector space lie algebra vector space modes, identify two modes dierence vanishes fock space representations. conformal field theory 38 r, z, agrees formally (163). physically relevant representations satisfy condition spectrum l0 (the zero mode conformal stress-energy-tensor) bounded below. implies exists state 0 f annihilated modes vn() n > 0 (since vn() lowers l0 eigenvalue n follows (83)); state called (virasoro) highest weight state. representation irreducible, i.e. contain proper subrepresentations, representation generated 0 action modes reproduces whole representation space, may therefore assume (and ) highest weight states. using mode expansion meromorphic eld v (, z), highest weight property rewritten condition pole z amplitude involving v (, z)|i order h, h conformal weight . mobius covariance amplitudes, also equivalent condition order pole (zi u) (183) bounded conformal weight i, hi. 0 virasoro highest weight state, v0()0 . space virasoro highest weight states therefore forms representation zero modes meromorphic elds. conversely, given representation r zero modes consider space states generated state r action negative modes; called verma module. precisely, verma module v vector space spanned states form vn1(1) vnn (n ) r , ni < 0, modulo relations (190) (191) vl1(1) vlr (r)(cid:16)vn()vm() vm()vn()(cid:17)vlr+1(r+1) vln (n ) = vl1(1) vlr (r)hvn(), vm()ivlr+1(r+1) vln (n ) , r,  stands right-hand-side (90). meromor- phic conformal eld theory generated nite set elds, w 1(z), . . . w s(z), one show  verma module spanned so-called poincare-birkho-witt basis consists vectors form w i1 m1 w il ml , (192) r, mj > 0, 1 ij+1 ij mj mj+1 ij = ij+1. actual fock space representation f certain quotient verma module, set zero states vanish identically amplitudes; states called null-vectors. 4.2. illustrative example stressed stage condition representation meromorphic conformal eld theory usually stronger representation lie algebra (or w-algebra) modes generating elds. example, case ane theories introduced section 3.7.2, latter condition conformal field theory 39 means representation space representation ane algebra (130), value k, exist innitely many (non-integral) representations. hand, k positive integer, meromorphic theory possesses null-vectors, representations ane algebra representations meromorphic conformal eld theory null-elds act trivially representation space; selects nite number representations. example, g = su(2), ane algebra written (in cartan-weyl basis)  1 2 kmm,n  =  = j n ] = 2hm+n + kmm,n , m+n (193) (194) k positive integer, vector n =(cid:0)j + 1(cid:1)k+1 singular vector, i.e. descendant highest weight vector annihilated modes vn() n > 0. follows fact positive modes generating elds annihilate n obvious hnn = j + n n consequence lnn = 0 n > 0 together n n = 0, j j 1 n = 1 , j + 1](j + 1)kl (j + 1)l (see also ). zero modes ane algebra su(2) form nite lie algebra su(2). every (nite-dimensional) representation r su(2), i.e. every spin j z/2, construct verma module su(2) whose virasoro highest weight space transforms r.

(199) furthermore, subspace must also contain every state whose zero mode form v0()v0((l1 + l0)) v0((l1 + l0))v0(). order describe states form explicitly, useful observe virasoro highest weight states conformal field theory 40 indeed, |j, ji virasoro highest weight state j + 0 |j, ji = 0 h0|j, ji = j|j, ji, h |v (, 1)|i =xl h |vl()|i = h |v0()|i , (200) since highest weight property implies vl()|i = 0 l > 0 similarly, using (100), h |vl() = 0 l < 0. translation symmetry amplitudes, rewritten h |(1) = h |v0()|i . let us introduce operators v (n )() =i0 dw wn +1 v (cid:16)(w + 1)l0 , w(cid:17) , (201) (202) conformal field theory 41 n arbitrary integer, contour small circle encircles w = 0 w = 1. arbitrary virasoro highest weight states n > 0, h |(1) v (n )()i = 0 , (203) since integrand (203) poles w = 1 w = . (201) implies zero mode corresponding state vanishes arbitrary highest weight state (since amplitude highest weight state vanishes). let us denote o(f0) subspace f0 generated states form v (n )() n > 0, dene quotient space a(f0) = f0/o(f0). implies associate zero mode (acting highest weight state) state a(f0). write (202) terms modes v (n )() = hxn=0(cid:18)h n(cid:19)vnn () , conformal weight h, therefore follows v (1)() = vh1() + hvh() = (l1 + l0) . thus o(f0) contains states (199). furthermore, v (n )(l1) =i0 = i0 dw dw wn +1 (w + 1)h+1 dv (, w) dw dw(cid:18) (w + 1)h+1 wn +1 (cid:19) v (, w) = (n h)v (n )() + (n + 1)v (n +1)() , implies, n 6= 1, v (n +1)() = 1 n + 1 v (n )(l1) n h n + 1 v (n )() . (204) (205) (206) (207) thus o(f0) actually generated states form v (1)(), arbitrary states f0. shall show momentarily, vector space a(f0) actually structure associative algebra, product dened l v (0)() , (208) v (0)() given (202) (204); algebra called zhus algebra. analogue (203) h |(1) v (0)()i = (1)hhv0() |(1) = (1)hhv0() |v0()|i = h |v0()v0()|i , (209) (210) thus product a(f0) corresponds indeed action zero modes. conformal field theory 42 order exhibit structure algebra useful introduce second set modes v (n ) c () = (1)ni dw w 1 (w + 1)(cid:18) w + 1 w (cid:19)n v (cid:0)(w + 1)l0, w(cid:1) . modes characterised property h |(1) v (n ) h |(1) v (0) c c () = 0 () = h | (v0()) (1) . n > 0, (211) (212) (213) obvious (204) (211) v (1)() = v (1) (), analogue (207) v (n +1) c () = 1 n + 1 v (n ) c (l1) c n + h n + 1 v (n ) c () .

(215) conformal field theory 43 two endomorphisms, 1, 2, f0, leave o(f0) invariant (so induce endomorphisms a(f0)), shall write 1 2 agree endomorphisms a(f0), i.e. (1 2)f0 o(f0). similarly write 0 o(f0). way action v (, z) uniquely characterised locality (51), prove following uniqueness theorem zhu modes {$9810019$}: suppose endomorphism f0 leaves o(f0) invariant satises =  n(f0) f0. vl(). proof: follows = vr() vr() = vr() = vr() vl() vl() , used vl() = vr() = . immediate consequence vl(vl()) vl()vl() , (216) particular case (using fact every element n(f0) written vl() suitable ) vl(n()) n()vl() . (217) particular implies product (208) l well-dened , a(f0). furthermore, (216) shows product associative, thus a(f0) structure algebra. also dene product r = vr(). since l = vl() = vl()vr() vr()vl() = vr() = r denes reverse ring (or algebra) structure. explained before, algebra plays role algebra zero modes. since constructed terms space states meromorphic theory, null-relations taken account, one may therefore expect irreducible representations one-to-one correspondence irreducible representation meromorphic conformal eld theory. indeed true , although proof rather non-trivial. 4.4. finite (or rational) theories since zhus algebra plays central role characterising structure conformal eld theory, one may expect theories nite-dimensional particularly simple tractable. physics literature theories sometimes called rational , although may seem appropriate call nite, conformal field theory 44 shall so. name rational originates observation conformal weights states well central charge rational numbers theories {$9510017$}. unfortunately, uniform denition rationality, indeed, notion used somewhat dierently mathematics physics; survey common denitions given appendix. paper shall adopt convention theory called nite zhus algebra nite-dimensional, called rational satises conditions zhus denition together c2 criterion (see appendix). determination zhus algebra usually rather dicult since modes n() generate space o(f0) homogeneous respect l0. would therefore interesting nd equivalent condition niteness conformal eld theory easier analyse practice. one condition implies (and may equivalent to) niteness meromorphic conformal eld theory so-called c2 condition zhu : condition quotient space a(1)(f0) = h/o(1)(f0) (218) nite-dimensional, o(1)(f0) spanned states form vl() l h, conformal weight . dicult show dimension zhus algebra bounded quotient space , i.e. dim(a(f0)) dim(a(1)(f0)). many cases two dimensions actually same, true general; simplest counter example theory associated ane algebra g = e8 level k = 1. mentioned before, theory equivalently described meromorphic conformal eld theory associated self-dual root lattice e8, well known representation meromorphic conformal eld theory ; highest weight space vacuum representation one-dimensional, zhus algebra therefore also one-dimensional. hand, clear dimension a(1)(f0) least 249 since vacuum state 248 vectors form j 1 (where runs basis 248-dimensional adjoint representation e8) linearly independent a(1)(f0). many examples nite conformal eld theories known. examples mentioned section 3.7, theories associated even euclidean lattices (3.7.4) always nite (and unitary) , ane theories (3.7.2) nite level k positive integer  (in case theory also unitary), virasoro models (3.7.3) nite belong so-called minimal series . case provided central charge c form cp,q = 1 6(p q)2 pq , (219) p, q 2 coprime integers. case exist nitely many irreducible representations meromorphic conformal eld theory. representation incidentally, a(1)(f0) also structure abelian algebra; signicance algebra however clear present. conformal field theory 45 irreducible quotient space verma module generated highest weight state conformal weight h, allowed values h h(r,s) = (rp qs)2 (p q)2 4pq , (220) 1 r q 1 1 p 1, (r, s) denes value (q r, p s). corresponding verma modules two null-vectors conformal weights h+rs h+(pr)(q s), respectively, actual fock space quotient space verma module subspace generated two null-vectors . therefore (p 1)(q 1)/2 inequivalent irreducible highest weight representations, zhus algebra dimension (p 1)(q 1)/2, form (221) c/y(r,s) (t h(r,s)) . case dimension zhus algebra actually agrees dimension homogeneous quotient space (218). indeed, choose basis (218) consist states form 2, l = 0, 1, . . .. c = cp,q meromorphic verma module null-vector level (p 1)(q 1) (since corresponds r = = 1), since coecient l(p1)(q1)/2 null-vector vanish , allows us express l(p1)(q1)/2 terms states o(1)(f0), thus shows dimension a(1)(f0) indeed (p 1)(q 1)/2. 2 2 minimal models include unitary discrete series (138) choose p = q = + 1, also include non-unitary nite theories. theory (p, q) = (2, 3) trivial since c = 0, simplest (non-trivial) unitary theory called ising model (p, q) = (3, 4) : theory c = 1 2 , allowed representations conformal weight h = 0 (vacuum) h = 1 2 (energy) h = 1 16 (spin) .
