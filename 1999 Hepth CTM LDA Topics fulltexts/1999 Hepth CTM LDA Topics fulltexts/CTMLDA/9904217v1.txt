the low energy dynamics is that of a black string in 5 dimensional n = 1 supergravity.

the infrared dynamics on the string worldsheet is an n = (0, 4) 2d conformal eld theory.

assuming the 2d cft can be described as a nonlinear sigma model, we describe the target

space geometry of this model in terms of the data of x and p. variations of weight two

hodge structures enter the construction of the model in an interesting way.

1. introduction

d-brane and m-brane models of black holes have provided an extremely intriguing

approach to an understanding of black hole entropy [1] and promise to lead to important

insights in other aspects of black hole physics.

the program of strominger and vafa is based on mapping the low energy dynamics

of certain congurations of branes to the conformal eld theory of an eective string. the

derivation of this conformal eld theory is best understood (and already quite subtle) for

black holes in backgrounds preserving 16 supersymmetries, such as iib compactication
on k3  s1. in this paper we will investigate an analogous conformal eld theory for 4d

black holes in backgrounds with 8 unbroken supersymmetries.

specically, in this paper we continue the investigation of the microscopic dynamics

of wrapped ve-branes following the work of maldacena, strominger, and witten [2]. we
consider m -theory compactications on ir1,3  s1  x where x is a nonsingular compact
calabi-yau 3-fold. the radius of s1 is taken to be large with respect to the length scale

set by x, which is in turn large compared to the 11d planck scale. we usually will take
the background 3-form c(3) to vanish. if an m 5-brane worldvolume w6 wraps ir s1 p,
where p is a four-manifold p  x then the resulting object is a string s with worldsheet
w2 wrapping ir  s1 in ir1,3  s1. at long distances the supergravity background is that
of a black hole in ir1,3 with 8 unbroken supersymmetries at innity. the 4-manifold p

must be a holomorphically embedded complex surface to preserve supersymmetry. in this

case the low energy dynamics of the string s is described by a (0, 4) cft and the number

of massless boson and fermion degrees of freedom can be expressed purely in terms of the

topology of p and of its embedding into x [2].

knowing the number of massless degrees of freedom suces to determine the entropy

microscopically, but for many purposes one would certainly like to know the data of the

(0, 4) conformal eld theory of s in much more detail. the object of this paper is to express

this data in terms of the data of the ambient calabi-yau geometry and the topology and

geometry of p.

in this introduction we summarize the structure of the sigma model that we will nd.

the detailed justication is described in the subsequent sections. much of what we say is

implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) described in [2]. let us begin with the overall count

of the degrees of freedom. in a supersymmetric conguration the surface p is a divisor
for a holomorphic line bundle l over x. let p = [p]  h 2(x; zz) be the rst chern

1

class of l. it is poincare dual to the 4-cycle dened by p. macroscopically, in the 5d

supergravity obtained from m theory on x, the string is a black string and p is the charge

of the string. using index theory and holomorphic geometry [2] computed the left- and

right-moving central charges:

cr = 6d +

1
2

c2  p

cl = 6d + c2  p,

(1.1)

where d := 1

6rx p 3 and c2  p := rx p c2(t x), verifying microscopically the entropy

computed macroscopically in [3]. these central charges can also be obtained from the

requirement of the complete anomaly cancellation in ve dimensions [4].

we now describe some of the local geometry of the target space. this is obtained by

considering the collective coordinates of the wrapped 5brane. these include the collec-
tive coordinates associated to the 5 scalars x a and the chiral two-form  of the 5-brane

worldvolume tensormultiplet.

we begin with the collective coordinates  associated to the ve scalars. the space

of supersymmetric wrappings of charge p is the set of divisors in x in the class p . this

is called a linear system because all divisors are zero-loci of global holomorphic sections

of l, and the latter is a linear space. of course two sections related by a multiplicative

constant have the same divisor, so the linear system is just a projective space

|p | := iph 0(p, l|p) = cipn .

(1.2)

assuming p is a smooth ample divisor, as we should to apply classical geometry [2], the

riemann-roch formula gives the dimension of the linear system (1.2):

n := d +

1
12

c2  p  1.

(1.3)

taking into account the position in noncompact ir3, the target space of the scalars is

 : w2  ir3  |p |.

(1.4)

in this paper we will make the important restriction that the vebrane wraps a smooth

4-cycle p. thus if d is the discriminant locus of singular divisors in the linear system we

restrict to maps  with image in

|p |s := |p |  d.

(1.5)

2

moreover, because of monodromy, we will even restrict attention to maps into a local
neighborhood u  |p |s. 1

now we consider the collective coordinates arising from the chiral two-form  on

worldvolumes of the form w6 = w2 p. the massless modes are associated with harmonic
two-forms on p. since the form is chiral there are b
2 (p)
right-moving chiral bosons. moreover, as shown in [2], one can express these topological

2 (p) left-moving and b+

2 := b+

2 := b

invariants of p in terms of d and c2  p :

b
2 = 4d +

b+
2 = 2d +

5
6
1
6

c2  p  1

c2  p  1

(1.6)

if b1(p) = 0 (which follows if b1(x) = 0) the only fermions are rightmoving. these

pair up to form

d +

1
12

c2  p

(1.7)

n = (0, 4) scalar multiplets with both left- and right- moving scalars. in addition there

are real purely leftmoving scalars neutral under supersymmetry. since

n = d +

1
12

c2  p  1 =

1
2

(b+

2  1)

(1.8)

there are |(p)| = b

2 (p)  b+

2 (p) such scalars.

let us now consider the scalars from the chiral two-form in more detail. the splitting

into left-movers and right-movers follows from the decomposition

h 2(p; ir) = h 2,(p, ir)  h 2,+(p; ir)

(1.9)

into anti-self-dual and self-dual parts respectively. since p is kahler we may further

decompose

h 2,+(p; ir) = [h 2,0(p)  h 0,2(p)]ir  ir  j

(1.10)

where j is the kahler class of p induced by that of x, while h 2,(p; ir) is purely of

hodge type (1, 1). a crucial point is that the splitting (1.9)(1.10) depends on p (i.e., on
the values of ), and hence on the (weight two) hodge structure of h 2(p; zz). thus, a

natural framework for working with the (0, 4) model is the theory of variation of hodge

structures. (see the references in [5] for some useful background material.)

1 we thank e. witten for stressing the importance of the monodromy.

3

the hodge structure on h 2(p) decomposes into a xed part and a variable part

(as functions of p):

h 2(p; ir) = h 2

f (p; ir)  h 2

v (p; ir)

(1.11)

where h 2

v is the orthogonal complement of h 2

f in the hodge metric (1, 2) :=rp 1  2.

the xed or rigid part is simply the space of 2-forms which extend to x. as pointed

out in [2], since p is ample the restriction map

 : h 2(x, zz)  h 2(p; zz)

(1.12)

is injective so h 2

f (p; ir) = h 2(x; ir). physically, the splitting (1.11) means the (0, 4)
sigma model splits (up to possible discrete identications by a nite group) into a product

of two sigma models which we call the universal factor and the entropic factor. the

terminology refers to the intuition that p should be regarded as large, so that d is a very

large positive integer, determining the leading term in the black hole entropy.

the cft for the universal factor is easily described.

it consists of a single (0, 4)
multiplet with target space ir3  s1 (for left- and right-movers) together with h1,1(x)  2
purely leftmoving bosons. 2 since  can be shifted by large gauge transformations in
h 2(x; zz) the universal factor is just a (0, 4) narain model with leftmoving gauge group of
rank h1,1(x)  2. the narain data is obtained from the projection of h 2(x; zz)  ir onto

the denite signature subspaces of the quadratic form (1, 2) =rp 1 2 =rx p 1 2.

the entropic factor is more subtle and is the focus of much of this paper. in describing

this model we will make the important assumption that the model can be described by a

geometrical lagrangian (see footnote 1 above). roughly speaking, a (0, 4) sigma model

the detailed conditions on the sigma model lagrangian are written in equations 2.13 -

lagrangian is determined by a choice of target space fm which has a hyper-kahler connec-
tion (with torsion) together with a triholomorphic vector bundle with connection v  fm.
in the following sections we will argue that in our case the target space fm of the

entropic factor has a holomorphic projection

2.20 below.

2 except when h1,1(x) = 1. in this case the compact scalar in s1 is purely right-moving and

p : fm  ipn

(1.13)

there is no left-moving gauge bundle.

4

where the projective space ipn is the linear system |p |. physically, the degrees of freedom
describing the bers of p have their origin in those of the self-dual two-form  on w6. the
2 (b+
bers are complex tori of complex dimension n = 1
2  1). moreover, the vector bundle
2 (p) b+
v has real rank |(p)| (h1,1(x) 2) = b
2 (p) (h1,1(x) 2), and the connection
on v is vertical, and at.

in section 5.3 below we argue that the torsion of the connection on t fm is zero, so
that the metric on fm is hyper-kahler. this metric may be described as follows. the

metric of the ambient calabi-yau x induces a metric on the normal bundle of p  x,
and therefore a metric on the linear system |p |. this metric is kahler, 3 and, by a version
of the calabi ansatz/c-map ([6]/[7]) there is an induced hyper-kahler metric on t |p|.

thus, the the local geometry of fm is that of t |p | with a hyper-kahler structure.

having described the local geometry of the target space we now turn to global issues.

there are several interesting issues one should address, but we focus on only one, namely

the nature of the bers of p (working locally in a patch of |p |). the derivation of the

sigma model lagrangian uses the chiral vebrane lagrangians of [8,9]. unfortunately, the
formalism of these papers does not determine the way in which zeromodes of the b
2 left-
chiral and b+
2 right-chiral scalars are paired with each other. therefore we must resort to
some guess-work.

the key motivation for our guess is that we expect that the target space of the sigma

model fm should be compact. otherwise it is hard to understand how we could have nite

dimensional spaces of bps states. since the linear system |p | is compact the question

reduces to compactness of the bers. therefore, all the b2(p) modes due to the chiral
-eld should be compact scalars. the most natural way to achieve this is to assume that

the ber above p is just a conformal eld theory on a torus with a at connection, i.e., a

narain model. the data of the narain model consists of a choice of lattice  of signature

(p, q) of zeromodes of scalars and an orthogonal projection of ir to the denite signature

subspaces dening the spectrum of left- and right-moving parts of the winding/momentum
lattice. in our case we will take  = h 2(p; zz) and the orthogonal projection is

h 2(p; zz)  ir  h 2,+(p; ir)  h 2,(p; ir)

(1.14)

induced from the metric on p. thus, according to our hypothesis, the bers of the pro-

jection in (1.13) are complex tori of dimension n , so we have a holomorphic integrable

3 warning: the metric on the linear system is not the fubini-study metric.

system. two interesting subtleties in this discussion are, rst, there is a nontrivial at

connection on the toroidal bers, and second, by a mechanism mentioned in [2] most of
the charges in h 2(p; zz) are not conserved (we comment on this briey in section 6).

finally we mention another motivation for the present work. d-brane models of black

holes appear to have interesting arithmetic properties [10,11], at least for the case of black

holes in backgrounds with 16 supersymmetries. one can entertain various conjectures

about the arithmetic nature of d-brane black holes in calabi-yau compactication and

several of these are related to questions about the numbers of bps states dim hbp s() for
charge   h even(x). the results of the present paper might help to elucidate the nature

of these bps degeneracies. our hope is that these degeneracies can be studied using (0, 4)

elliptic genera.

we summarize the remaining sections as follows. in section two we review the general

form of (0, 4) lagrangians.

in section three we review the relation between unbroken

supersymmetry and holomorphically wrapped 4-cycles.

in section four we describe in

detail the derivation of the collective coordinates and the relation to variation of hodge

structures. we derive carefully the (0, 4) supermultiplets by reducing the supersymmetry

transformations of the 6d tensormultiplet. in section ve we use the kaluza-klein ansatz

of section four in the chiral 5-brane action and derive the geometry of the target space of

the (0, 4) model. in section six we comment on some of the global aspects of the target

space model. these involve the toroidal bers of (1.13) and their relation to narian models.

in section seven we describe briey what we think are some of the most interesting open

problems raised by this paper. many conventions and technical points may be found in

the appendices. appendix d describes the close analogy of the models in this paper with

the strings obtained by wrapping d3 branes around holomorphic curves in a k3 surface.

2. geometrical data for (0, p) -models

in this section we summarize the geometrical data used to construct (0, 4) supersym-

metric lagrangians. this material is standard, and this section follows mostly [12,13].

in two spacetime dimensions the supersymmetry algebra of type (0, p) is carried by p

negative-chirality supersymmetries qi

, i = 1, ...p, obeying:

{qi

, qj

} = 2ij p

(2.1)

6

in the construction of the (0, 4) sigma-models it is convenient to consider a formulation

with only (0, 1) manifest supersymmetry. (0, 1) superspace consists of two bose coordinates
x+, x and a single negative-chirality anticommuting coordinate . our sigma-model is
dened by a map from (0,1) superspace  to a d-dimensional target manifold m, given
by scalar superelds i(x, ), i = 1, ...d. in general there can also be another eld which
is a section of the vector bundle s  v over , given by negative-chirality 4 spinor
superelds a
+(x, ), a = 1, ...n, where n is the bre dimension of v and s is the spinor
bundle over . v is equipped with a positive denite metric hab and a connection ai
b with
curvature fij
b valued in some subgroup of o(n). the requirement of (0,4) susy imposes
additional constraints which will be analyzed at the end of this section. the superelds

a

a

have the following expansions:

i(x, ) = (x)i + ii

(x)
+(x) + if a(x)

a

the action for the model in terms of (0, 1) superelds reads:

conditions (2.12) - (2.17) can be summarized as follows [13]: m admits three complex
structures obeying the algebra of quaternions, the metric on m is hermitian with respect
to all three complex structures and the holonomy of the connection (+) is a subgroup of
sp(d/4). the bundle v  c is holomorphic with respect to all three complex structures
and carries an hermitian metric hab.

3. supersymmetrically wrapped vebranes

the low energy states of the black string s are obtained from small deformations of

supersymmetrically wrapped cycles. thanks to the existence of a -symmetric vebrane

action we can analyze which congurations preserve supersymmetry, following the analysis

of [16].

the unbroken supersymmetries are the result of combining the supersymmetry  =
 with -symmetry  = 2(1 + ), where the matrix  is eld dependent (the explicit
expression can be found in [17]) and has the property that (1) are projection operators.

the condition of unbroken supersymmetry is

(1  )  p = 0.

(3.1)

let the m 5-brane be stretched in the x 0  x 5 directions, and consider a compact-
ication on a calabi-yau threefold along x 2, ..., x 7. we consider the wrapping of the
vebrane on a four-cycle p stretched in x 2  x 5 directions. the coordinates on the ve-
brane world-sheet are denoted by ,  = 0, ..., 5. it is convenient to choose a gauge such
that 0 = x 0, 1 = x 1. also let x m, x m, m = 1, 2 be a complex basis for x 2  x 5
(choosing a gauge such that dx 6 + idx 7 is an eigenvector of the complex structure on the

calabi-yau). an eleven-dimensional spinor  is decomposed as

 = (3)  (2)

  (6)

(3.2)

where (2)
spinor and (6)

 is a spinor of spin(2)01 of positive (negative) chirality, (3) is a spin(3)8910
is the covariantly constant spinor of the calabi-yau. the eleven-

dimensional -matrices can be decomposed as follows

8,9,10 = 8,9,10  (2)

01  (6)

0,1 = i13  0,1  (6)

2,3,4,...,7 = i15  2,3,4,...,7

(3.3)

where (2)
01 = i01 is the chirality operator of spin(2)01 and (6) is the chirality operator
acting on the calabi-yau spinors. we let m1...mk = [m1...mk]. denoting a positive
(negative)- chirality spinor on the calabi-yau by (6)
 , we can choose a normalization such
that the following identities hold

m(6)

+ = 0,

npq(6)

+ = 2ijn[pq](6)

+

(3.4)

where j is the kahler form for x. also, we have passed to a complex basis for the 
matrices such that 1
c ). we will omit the
subscript on the complex matrices whenever there is no possibility of confusion. equation

c = 3 + i5 = (2

c = 2 + i4 = (1

c ) and 2

(3.4) implies

mnpq(6) = (jnpjmq  jmpjnq)(6)

where we used jmn = igmn and the anticommutation relations. we thus have

p =

1

2(cid:18)1  2x m3x n4x p5x q 1

4

(jnpjmq  (m  n))(cid:19) 

(3.5)

(3.6)

where i = /i, ai = 2, ..., 5, and we have used 1212 = 42345. as expected,
p = 0 implies

(dv )4 = (

j  j)

(3.7)

where dv4 is the volume form of the part of the vebrane wrapping the calabi-yau four-
cycle and (j  j) is the pullback of j  j to the vebrane.

from (3.6), (3.7) it follows that for holomorphic (anti-holomorphic) cycles p only +
() can satisfy p = 0. thus only one eighth of the supersymmetry is preserved and

the resulting -model is chiral (4, 0) ((0, 4))

4. the massless (0, 4) supermultiplets

we now turn to the description of the massless degrees of freedom on s arising from

small uctuations around a supersymmetric wrapping of the vebrane worldvolume on
ir  s1  p. our method will be to reduce the six-dimensional (2, 0) multiplet along p. of

course, this presupposes some facts about the equations of motion. these will be justied

in the section ve.

4.1. reduction of the scalars

the ve scalars of the 6d (2, 0) tensormultiplet, denoted x a (cf b.2) parametrize

the position of the vebrane in eleven dimensions. when we wrap an m-theory vebrane
on a real four-cycle p inside a calabi-yau manifold, three scalars (call them x 8,9,10)

parametrize the position of the string in the noncompact dimensions, and the remaining

two describe the position of the cycle p inside the calabi-yau and should therefore be

thought of innitesimally as sections of the normal bundle.

10

the massless scalars arise from deformations of the position of w2  p preserving
unbroken supersymmetry. the space of deformations of p as a complex submanifold of x
has tangent space

tp |p | = h 0(p, n )

(4.1)

where n is the normal bundle. we may identify n = l|p .
it follows from the index
theorem that if p is ample the complex dimension of the space of deformations of p is
n = d + 1

12 c2p  1.

when we consider small uctuations of the wrapped vebrane on a cycle p we are re-
ally considering a family of cycles p near a point p=0 in the moduli space of deformations
of p. these t into a holomorphic bration
x

u

(4.2)



where u  |p |s is a neighborhood of  = 0. the bers of this family are dieomorphic
to p=0, but have variable complex structure. in appendix c we show that there is an
injection

0  h 0(x, l)/c  s = h 0(p, l|p)  h 0,1(t p)

(4.3)

where p is the vanishing locus of the section s. by kodaira-spencer theory h 0,1(t p) is
the space of innitesimal deformations of the complex structure of p [18]. thus, a rst

order deformation of  induces a nonzero deformation of complex structure. this will be

important in the next section.

finally, we write out the kaluza-klein ansatz for the scalars describing uctuations
around p. choosing a basis, i , for h 0 (p, l|p) and a coordinate system on x so that
dx 6 + idx 7 is normal to p we may expand, to rst order in i ,

x 6 + ix 7 = i i

(4.4)

to obtain complex two-dimensional massless elds i , i = 1, ..., n .these scalars are both
left- and right-moving.

4.2. reduction of the worldvolume two-form

the chiral two-form  on w6 reduces to left-moving and right-moving scalars according
to the decomposition into self-dual and anti-self dual parts as in equations (1.9)(1.10) of
the introduction. as mentioned in the introduction, h 2(p) carries a polarized hodge
structure of weight two. the hodge decomposition is simply

h 2(p; zz)  c = h 2,0(p)  h 1,1(p)  h 0,2(p)

(4.5)

and the polarization is given by the hodge metric.

fig.1 as we move in the moduli space of deformations, we may use c dieomor-

phisms to dene a at basis for h 2(p; zz) in the bers. however both the hodge

decomposition and the decomposition into self-dual/antiself-dual parts change.

it is important to bear in mind that the decomposition (4.5) and hence the decom-

position of  into left- and right-moving scalars depends on . as  changes the kahler

metric and complex structure on p varies, as illustrated in fig. 1. this is the standard

geometrical realization of variation of hodge structures [5]. since the bers are all dif-

feomorphic we can choose a family of c dieomorphisms and dene a local system (i.e.
a at bundle) with a locally constant basis for h 2(p; zz). extending by linearity denes
the gauss-manin connection on the bundle r2(c) over u whose ber at p is h 2(p).
the gauss-manin connection allows us to dierentiate in the i direction, and is crucial

in deriving the low-energy (0, 4) lagrangian.

if we choose a smoothly-varying basis i, i = 1, . . . , 1

2 1) of harmonic (2, 0) forms
on p, and a, a = 1, ..., b
2 (p), of anti-selfdual (1, 1)-forms on p, then these bases will
rotate into one another in accord with griths tansversality. that is, if we dene the
holomorphically varying ltration h 2(p) = f 0  f 1  f 2 by

2 (b+

then

f 0 = h 2,0  h 1,1  h 0,2

f 1 = h 2,0  h 1,1

f 2 = h 2,0

 : f p  f p1  1(u).

12

(4.6)

(4.7)

or, in plain english, the connection matrix is upper triangular and increases p in the

decomposition into (p, q) forms by at most one. we can split the hodge structure into a
xed and a variable part as in (1.11) of the introduction. the hodge structure h 2
f is xed
(as a function of p) because it is purely of type (1, 1) for all p.

finally, we write out the kaluza-klein ansatz for the chiral two-form  as:

 = a,a + 4(ii + c.c.) + u4j

(4.8)

the two-dimensional complex scalars i and the real scalar u4 are right-moving whereas
the b

2 real scalars a are left-moving.

4.3. reduction of (2, 0) tensormultiplet fermion elds along p

we now describe the kaluza-klein ansatz for the fermions in the 6d tensormultiplet
on w2  p. we will expand these in terms of harmonic 2-forms and 0-forms on p. the
conceptual reason we can do this is the following.

the 5-brane breaks local 6d lorentz symmetry on w6 as

spin(1, 1)  spin(4)  spin(1, 5)

(4.9)

so the fermions are in the 4 = (+ 1
2 ; 1, 2). moreover, the tensormultiplet
theory has a spin(5) = u sp(4) r symmetry group from local lorentz rotations in
the normal directions (in 11d) to w2  p. the calabi-yau background breaks this to
spin(3)  spin(2), where spin(3) are rotations in the noncompact normal directions and

2 ; 2, 1)  ( 1

spin(2) is the structure group of the normal bundle n for p in x. the restriction of the

spin bundle on x to p decomposes as:

s+(t x) = s+(t p)  k 1/2  s(t p)  k 1/2

but, because p is kahler,

s+(t p)  k 1/2 = 0,0(p)  2,0(p).

(4.10)

(4.11)

hence we expand the zeromodes in terms of 0-forms and 2-forms on p.

in order to reduce the supersymmetry transformations we will need to make (4.11)

more explicit. our conventions for six-dimensional supersymmetry are in appendix b. we

choose a basis for six-dimensional  matrices to be

0,1 = 0,1  (4)

2,3,4,5 = i12  2,3,4,5

13

(4.12)

where

2,3,4 =(cid:18) 0

1,2,3

0 = i2; 1 = 1
1,2,3

0 (cid:19); 5 =(cid:18) 0

i i12

i i12

0 (cid:19)

(4.13)

we will decompose the covariantly constant spinor on the calabi-yau into two- and

four-dimensional parts

(6) = (2)  

(4.14)

we take (6) to be anti-chiral in order to conform to the chirality of the tensor multiplet.

note that the spin(2)67 and spin(4)2345 spinors (2) and  are not covariantly constant

but only projectively covaraintly constant. that is, they are parallel up to a phase, and

the phase cancels between (2) and .

again, using (4.9), the 6d tensormultiplet spinors (6) in their turn decompose as

(6)
i = i

i  i

(i) + 0

i  (i).

(4.15)

here i = 1, 2, 3, 4 is a u sp(4) r-symmetry index (see appendix b) and there is no sum-

mation on i. moreover,

and

i

(i) =(cid:26) i
(i) =(cid:26) 



mnmn
i,mnmn

for i = 1, 3
for i = 2, 4

for i = 1, 3
for i = 2, 4

(4.16)

(4.17)

this decomposition is consistent with the symplectic reality condition, which with our

conventions reads

1 = i

2,

3 = i
4

(4.18)

thus the two-dimensional spinors i

i correspond to two complex spinor degrees of

freedom; they carry a subscript minus since only right-moving spinors survive the wrapping

as massless degrees of freedom. note, for use in section 5.2 that since m(6) = 0 one learns

that m = 0.

14

4.4. reduction of the supersymmetry transformations

we now come to the reduction of the 6d supersymmetry transformations. in prin-

ciple, we should take into account all the complications of kappa supersymmetry and the

exact superisometries unbroken by the background determined by x and p. however, as

explained in section 4.6 below, it is sucient for our purposes to consider the reduction of

the supersymmetry transformations from at space.

as a preliminary to the calculation it will prove very useful to relate the basis i of
(4.4) (used for the scalars) to the basis i of holomorphic (2, 0) forms on p. abstractly
this is a consequence of

h 0(p, l|p) = h 0(p, 2

p ) = h 2,0(p),

(4.19)

which follows from the adjunction formula (kx  l)|p = kp and the triviality of the
canonical bundle kx of x. more explicitly we have a relation between the basis of the
holomorphic two-forms on p, i,mn, and i given by:

i = i,mnmn; i = t ri,mnmn

(4.20)

conversely, one can write (i)|(3,0)
nowhere zero holomorphic three-form on x

p

= (2,0)

i

where  is a contraction and (3,0) is a

substituting the above expansions into the supersymmetry transformations of the

tensormultiplet the supersymmetry transformation of the -eld yields

i = 2(i+)(1 + it )iji
j
u4 = 2 (i+) tij 0
j
a = 0

(4.21)

where t = 67 and 1
susy transformations for the x a gives

2 (1 + it ) is a projection operator. similarly, the reduction of the

i = 2(i+)(cid:0)6(1 + it )(cid:1)ij i

x 8,9,10 = 2 (i+) 8,9,10

0
j

ij

j

the second lines in (4.21) and (4.22) can be joined into a single equation

ua = 2 (i+) a

ij0
j

15

(4.22)

(4.23)

where a = 1, ...4 and we have dened a=1,2,3 = 8,9,10 and a=4 = t , and

u1 = x 8,

u2 = x 9,

u3 = x 10

(4.24)

finally, the transformation laws of the fermions reduces to

i

2 =

1
2

(cid:0)i 4+ + i2+(cid:1) ;

0

i =

2

(cid:0)i 2+ + i4+(cid:1)

(4.25)

where  = i,  = 0 + 1.
convenient to work explicitly with components. of course the other two transformations
(i

3) are related to the above by the symplectic reality condition (4.18). we will

in the rst line of (4.25) we have found it more

1, i

give a considerably more attractive form of this equation in the next section.

4.5. assembling the multiplets and the hyper-kahler structure

we will now summarize the previous sections by describing the (0, 4) supermultiplets

in terms of the a hyper-kahler structure.

note rst that from the above supersymmetry transformations the four real scalars ua
and the four real component spinor 0 transform amongst themselves. since this multiplet

is present no matter what the topology of x or p is, we refer to it as the universal

multiplet.

it has some nice analogies with the universal hypermultiplet of calabi-yau

compactication of type ii strings.

we now cast the susy transformations in quaternionic form. by letting w = u4 

iu3; z = u2 + iu1 the bosonic coordinate x has the form

x =(cid:18) z

w z(cid:19)

w

moreover if we dene the quaternions

 =(cid:18) 





(cid:19) ; 0 =(cid:18) 

 (cid:19)



where we have set  = i2+;  = i4+;  = 0

1;  = 0

4, then (4.23) reads

x = 4i  .

16

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

the corresponding fermionic transformation (the second line of (4.25)) becomes

 = 

i
2

x  

(4.29)

these are the supersymmetry transformations of the universal supereld in a manifestly
(0, 4) invariant form. geometrically, the four scalars parametrize u = ir3  s1 (the u4

scalar coming from tensor eld is periodic).

similarly, if we dene

and

i := dij j

dij :=zp

i  j

(4.30)

(4.31)

we see from the supersymmetry transformations that the scalars i and i mix under 2.

proceeding in the same manner we dene

xi =(cid:18) i

i

and

i i(cid:19)

i



i

i(cid:19) ; i =(cid:18) i
 =(cid:18) 

 (cid:19)

(4.32)

(4.33)

where now  = 4+;  = 2+; i = i
4. we see that the transformations
i and i are joined together since the rst lines of (4.21) and (4.22) can be expressed

2; i = i

compactly as

xi = 4i  i

similarly the fermionic transformations (the rst line of (4.25)) become

i =

1
2

  xi

(4.34)

(4.35)

and once more the (0, 4) supersymmetry is manifest. it is clear from our construction that

i play the role of coordinates on the cotangent space. thus, the target space is locally

t |p |.

17

4.6. comparison with standard (0, 4) models

now that we have determined the eld content and (0, 4) multiplets let us begin to

make contact with the general form of the lagrangian described in section 2. since the
target space is locally u  t |p| there must be n + 1 = d + 1
12 c2  p scalar multiplets. the
scalars in these multiplets have both left- and right-moving degrees of freedom, whereas
the complex scalars i derived from (4.8) are purely right-moving. on the other hand,
the chiral 2-form  also gives b
2 real left-moving scalars a. since the signature of p is
negative, we must pair b+
2 degrees of freedom from the a with the rightmovers i. the
remaining |(p)| degrees of freedom correspond to the left-moving fermions denoted by

 in section 2. we will discuss this pairing of left- and right-moving degrees of freedom

further in section 5 below.

we can also compare with the supersymmetry transformations of section two. let
zm = (x, ) be the superembedding coordinates and let m = (m, ); a = (a, ) be

curved and inertial eleven dimensional indices respectively. lower-case latin (greek)

letters denote bosonic (fermionic) components. up to local lorentz transformations the
vielbein transforms under supercoordinate transformations as ea
m = dm a where dm is
the covariant derivative. we see that the fermionic transformations which preserve a given

background are parametrized by covariantly constant spinors . the fermionic symmetries

of the vebrane are:

zm = em

 ; zm = (1 + )

em


(4.36)

where  is as in section 3.

in order to recover the eld content of the six dimensional (2, 0) tensor multiplet we

need to do some gauge xing. upon reducing the resulting equations to two dimensions we

get highly non-linear expressions. ultimately we want to compare with the supersymme-

tries of the sigma model presented in section 2 (which is quadratic both in derivatives and

in the right-moving fermions). such a truncation brings us back to the supersymmetry

transformations of appendix b.2 and their reduction, equations ((4.34), (4.35)). compar-

ing with (2.10) we can read o the three complex structures encoded in these equations:
let us choose a real basis i = 1i + i2i ; i := dij j = 3i + i4i . similarly
i = 1i + i2i; i = 4i + i3i and  = 0 + i1;  = 2 + i3. with these denitions

(4.34) takes the form

ii = 0ii + rjr

ii

jj jj , i = 1, . . . 4

(4.37)

18

where

j1 = [3  i2]i

ji

j , j2 = [i2  i12]i

ji

j , j3 = [1  i2]i

ji

j

(4.38)

one can verify that they satisfy jrjs = (rs + rstjt).

5. local target-space geometry

the low-energy two-dimensional lagrangian encodes the geometry of the target space

of the (0, 4) model. we will derive this lagrangian by kaluza-klein reduction of the chiral

vebrane lagrangian of [8,9].

5.1. bosonic lagrangian

let us start by reducing the bosonic part of the ve-brane action presented in [9].

the action possesses manifest general coordinate covariance only along ve of the six

worldvolume dimensions. here we will take the distinguished direction to be the spa-

tial direction of the two-dimensional world-sheet w2 which is taken to be at. for our
conventions/denitions we refer to appendix a.2.

the action consists of three terms

l1 = rdet(cid:16)g + ggeh /pg5(cid:17)

l2 = 

l3 =

1
8



1

g1

4eh  1
g11 eh eh 

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

we will use the static gauge x  =   in which the above expressions simplify and we

recover the eld content of the (2, 0) six-dimensional multiplet discussed in the appendix

b (note however that here we are using a gauge in which the antisymmetric tensor is

eectively ve-dimensional in the sense that 1  = 0). moreover we will keep only terms
at most quadratic in x and/or h. as explained before, when reducing to w2  p the
only nonvanishing components of the eld  are along p. hence (5.1) - (5.3) read

l1 =

1
2

gab x a x b 

1

4eh eh (1 + gabx ax b) 

l2 =

(5.4)

(5.5)

19

1

l3 =

4eh  h gabx a1x b

(5.6)

where gab is the metric on the space transverse to the vebrane. keeping only up to two-
derivative terms and dropping terms with derivatives along p (which are suppressed by

the size of p) the above expressions simplify further

s =zw6

(5.7)

reducing the kinetic term of the scalars in (5.7) using (4.4) we see that it gives rise to a

term,

zw2

d2(+i )j gij ,

(5.8)

where gij =rp dv g(l)i j , and g(l) is the hermitian metric on the line bundle l|p =

n (p  x) (in complex notation, it has only one component). by using a fierz identity

(see b.1) we can establish the metric on the space of s in terms of the intersection matrix

gij = dij =zp

i  j .

(5.9)

as for the chiral two-form, the reduction of (5.7) gives (omitting the universal super-

eld)

s0 =zw2

5.2. fermionic lagrangian

d2((0i+)j dij  0abdab).

(5.10)

equations (5.8), (5.9) and (5.10) contain some of the essential information we need to

extract the geometric data for the (0, 4) lagrangian. however, to extract all the data we

must consider the quadratic terms in fermions. therefore, we look at the terms quadratic

in the right-moving fermions containing exactly one derivative along w2. these come from
the reduction to w2 of the quadratic lagrangian for fermions:

abcd0ab1c dd

abcdabcdd!,

20

(5.11)

where  is the eleven-dimensional superspace coordinate (the superpartner of the em-
bedding coordinates x m ()), s are eleven-dimensional gamma-matrices and d is the
pullback of the spin connection from the ambient space to the vebrane worldvolume w6.
this piece of the action is obtained by gauge xing the -symmetric action of [17] in a

general curved background, keeping only the terms quadratic in  which involve exactly
one derivative along w2, and discarding o((x a)2) terms. the last term comes from the
coupling of the six-form potential to the vebrane worldvolme.

in reducing (5.11) we can make use of the -symmetry to eliminate the unphysical
degrees of freedom of  and express it in terms of six-dimensional spinors i  i , i
 
()i. here i , i
 are two-dimensional weyl spinors and i are four-dimensional weyl
spinors (see section 3.2 and appendix b). the six-dimensional -matrices decompose as
in section 3.2. suppressing internal (along p) covariant derivatives on the spinors, the
reduced action can be cast in the form (the universal supereld is not included)

d2+k [(j )i rji

k + (j

)i

rkji ] + c.c.

(5.12)

where we use the same conventions for the two-dimensional fermions as in section 3 and

we have dened

dv (j )ki ; rkji =zp

dv (j )trk ()i,

(5.13)

where i is the covariant derivative discussed in section 4.2.

we will now analyze the meaning of the coupling of (5.13) to extract the target
space geometry. as in section 4.1 we consider a family of surfaces p near p=0. with
respect to our basis of holomorphic two-forms  acts in the following way:

j i = [j ]x

i x

(5.14)

where x  {i, i, a} and [j ] is the - dependent gauss-manin connection matrix. there-
fore

k dij =zp

k i  j =zp

[k ]l

i l  j ,

(5.15)

i . on the other hand i = i((2)) , (2) = ab 

xa 

zw2
k =zp

rji

where we have dened i = 

xb and its easy to see that

rkji =zp

dv j ((2))k i ((2))

dv mnjmn[k ]x

ixabab = kdij .

(5.16)

=zp

for the last step we have used (5.15), the fact that m = 0 (as in 4.3) and a little bit
of gamma-matrix algebra. we conclude that rkji is just the christoel symbol of the
manifold |p| with kahler metric (5.9).

5.3. comparison to the standard (0, 4) lagrangian

let us now assemble the data we have gathered and compare to the standard la-

grangian spelled out in section two. the part of (the bosonized version of) the (0, 4)

action (2.5) containing all one-derivative terms quadratic in fermions is

j
i

[fija+a + (+)

ijk +k].

(5.17)

where a, a = 1, . . . , b

2  b+

2 is the set of purely left-moving scalar elds.

comparison to (5.12) implies that the b-eld and the gauge connection of the vector

bundle over the target-space are at, and that the metric on the target-space is

ds2 = d(, )ij di dj + d(, )ij ()i()j

(5.18)

where dij is the intersection pairing dened in (5.9). since the connection on tfm has

no torsion supersymmetry requires that the metric (5.18) is hyper-kahler, and indeed,

gives a way to prove the hyperkahler property of the metric. using the supersymmetry

transformations (4.37) and the fact that (0, 4) symmetry is unbroken, it follows that the 3

complex structures in (4.38) are covariantly constant. 5

it is interesting to compare the metric with the c-map construction [7]. the metric

there reads

ds2 = dij di  dj + dij ()i  ()j

(5.19)

(note that in this case dij = dij ) one has three closed two-forms 1, 2, 3 where
1 is the associated (1, 1) form and 1,2 are the real, imaginary parts of di  ()i.
setting di = d1i + id2i ; ()i := dij ()j = d3i + id4i , the metric takes the
form ds2 = gii,jj dii  djj , where gii,jj = dij ij. the three two-forms can be used
to construct three complex structures jr
kk,jj which in components read:
ji
j1 = [3  i2]i
j . these are exactly the

jj := gii,kk r
j , j3 = [1  i2]i

j , j2 = [i2  i12]i

ji

ii

ji

same as in (4.38).

5 it would be desirable to have a more direct, and more standard proof of this fact. this is

being investigated in [19].

6. comments on the global structure of the target space

6.1. narain theory in the entropic factor

we now consider to the periodicities of , needed to determine the global structure of

the bers of p in (1.13). as we have stressed in the introduction, we expect the target space
to be compact. therefore, while the local target manifold is ir4  t |p |, the bers should

be compactied, maintaining the hyper-kahler property. the most natural (perhaps the

only) way to do this is to take a quotient by a lattice in the ber of t |p| so that the

bers of fm are complex tori.

passing to a real basis { i , i = 1, . . . b+

2 } of self-dual two forms on p we can expand

 = 

i  i + aa

and reexpress (5.10) as

s0 =zw2

d2(0

i+

j d i j  0abdab).

(6.1)

(6.2)

where d i j =rp  i   j . thus the metric is diagonal on left- and right-movers. however,

the information of how to combine the zero-modes of the left and a right-moving bosons

to dene the statespace of the full conformal eld theory is not contained in (6.2). this

has to be imposed ad hoc.

our ansatz is that the lagrangian in (6.2) is a narain  - model with non-trivial

narain data: a constant metric, a constant torsion, and wilson lines. thus, we take the

periodicities

   + nxux, nx  zz

(6.3)

where we have introduced a basis {ux; x = 1, . . . b2} of h 2(p, zz). the data for the zero-
modes of the scalars are encoded in the projections onto the denite signature subspaces:

p : h 2(p; zz)  ir  h 2(p; ir)  h 2+(p; ir).

(6.4)

in particular, the left and right-moving momenta are just p = (f a
f a

x =rp  i  ux, and ea is the vielbein for the metric dab and e i is the

x nxe i), where

x =rp a  ux; f i

vielbein for d i j .

x nxea; f i

23

6.2. charge violation by instantons: the msw eect

the narain model of the previous section is somewhat peculiar because the conserved
u (1) charges coupling to the string are in the lattice h 2(x; zz) which is a (small!) sub-
lattice of h 2(p; zz). this puzzle was resolved in [2] as follows. 6 the charges h 2(p; zz)
are conserved in the (0, 4) sigma model studied in this paper, but they are violated by

membrane instanton processes in the full m -theory. as mentioned in [2] if a state in the
(0, 4) cft is charged under an element in h 2(p; zz) which is not in h 2(x; zz) it will decay
to a state charged in h 2(x; zz). indeed, since the map (1.12) is injective the dual map:

h2(p; zz)  h2(x; zz)  0

(6.5)

is surjective, and hence has a large kernel. elements of the kernel are nontrivial surfaces

[]  h2(p; zz) which bound a 3-ball in x,  = b. it is possible to have a membrane
instanton whose worldvolume is b because the equation

dh = q(m 2)(  w6),

(6.6)

where h = d and q(m 2) is the membrane charge, allows membranes to end on ve-

branes [20]. since this process uses m -theory instantons, it will only be important near

degenerations of p.

one interesting question raised by this msw eect is whether states on the 5brane

can carry torsion charges. the kernel of  is a sublattice of h2(p; zz). we claim that
under poincare duality p d : h2(p; zz)  h 2(p; zz), we have p d(ker ) = (h 2(x; zz))
where the orthogonal complement is in the hodge metric of p. to prove this note that if
[]  ker  then its poincare dual form   h 2(p; zz) satises

zp

  () =z()



(6.7)

for all   h 2(x; zz). since (h 2(x; zz)) is not unimodular while h 2(p; zz) is unimodu-
lar, the sublattice (h 2(x; zz))  (h 2(x; zz)) will have nite index in h 2(p; zz). the
quotient group is a (large) group of potential torsion charges. we say potential because

we do not fully understand the model globally on |p |. it would be interesting to under-

stand how the above torsion charges can be understood in the framework of the k-theory

interpretation of d-brane charges [21,22].

6 we thank j. maldacena and e. witten for important clarifying explanations about this

process.

24

6.3. narain data for the universal factor

it is possible to be much more explicit about the lagrangian for the universal multiplet.

just as for the rest of the elds, its action follows from the reduction of (5.7) and (5.11).
let {j, ;  = 1, . . . h1,1(x)  1} be a basis of h 1,1(x, ir) such that  restricts to
a basis of anti-self-dual forms on p. moreover, let {yw; w = 0, . . . h1,1(x)  1} be a basis
of h 1,1(x, zz). the part u of the chiral 2-form contributing to the universal multiplet
is expanded as

with the periodicities

u = u4j + 

u  u + nwyw; nw  zz.

(6.8)

(6.9)

the universal multiplet is governed by the action

sun =zw2

d2{d000u4+u4  d0

}

(6.10)

where d :=rp    =rx p    ; d00 :=rp j  j = 2v ol(p).

repeating the analysis of section 6.1 we see that the left/right-moving momenta are

given by

p = (f 

w nwe; f 0

wnwe0)

where f 

w :=rp   yw; f 0

w :=rp j  yw are the projections

p : h 2(x, zz)  ir  h 2+(x, ir)  h 2(x, ir),

(6.11)

(6.12)

and e (e0) is a vielbein for the metric d (d00). the self-dual (right-moving) piece is
generated by j. the the radius r of the s1 in the target space is given by r2 = 1
22 v ol(p),
when h1,1(x) = 1, and by more complicated formulae in general.

6.4. eects of the m -theory 3-form

finally, let us comment on two eects that happen when we turn on the c3 eld of

the eleven-dimensional supergravity.

first, in the kaluza-klein reduction of m theory on x the eld c3 gives rise to
h1,1(x) ve-dimensional vectors (together with kk modes from the metric these form the

25

(l0 el0) =zp(cid:18)p   +

1
2

  (cid:19).

(6.14)

gravity multiplet and h1,1(x)  1 vector multiplets). the coupling of c3 to the vebrane
worldvolume induces string couplings to the background gauge elds

zw2

d2{a

+

d + a0

+u4d00}

(6.13)

where a are the abelian vector elds and a0 is the graviphoton. such couplings are also

important for cancellation of anomalies in the gauge transformations in the presence of the

string [23]. since the projections in (6.12) already encode narain data, including the at

connection on the gauge bundle, we see that turning on c3 just shifts the gauge elds.

second, the 5brane action consists of a dirac part and a wz part.

in the dirac

part the eldstrength of the chiral 2-form enters through h = d  c3. in the kaluza-
klein reduction this leads to shifts of the periodicities of the chiral scalars, for example,
+ i  + i + c i . if c3 = dx 1  , with   h 2(x; ir) then the narain vectors are

shifted by p  p + , leading to a shift in l0 el0. if we consider the corresponding iia

picture this is in accord with the witten-eect shifting of the d0 charge:

where we have identied p with the rst chern class of the chan-paton bundle on the d4

brane.

7. conclusion: 5 problems on 5 branes

first and foremost it would be good to extend the discussion in this paper to under-

stand the global geometry on |p |. this consists of at least two important sub-problems.

first, we have restricted to an open neighborhood in |p |s. it would be interesting to take
into account the eects of monodromy. second, the 4-cycle p will degenerate on a codi-

mension one discriminant locus d = |p ||p |s of the linear system. the generic singularity
will be a rational double point. many interesting and important questions depend crucially

on understanding what happens to the (0, 4) model when the vebrane degenerates. in

[24] a drastic degeneration with d points of self-intersection was successfully used to count

black hole entropy at leading order in large charges.

second, as mentioned in the introduction, one of the original motivations for this work

was to nd a state-counting formula for bps states in m -theory compactications which

are macroscopically 4d black holes with 8 supersymmetries. we believe that combining

26

the elliptic genus of (0, 4) models studied in [25] with the results of this paper one can

derive formulae for the bps degeneracies. this idea is currently under investigation.

third, it would be nice to clarify the status of the above model as a cft. since

the -model described in this paper is rather elaborate, it would be nice to have a clear

understanding of whether the entropic factor is, in fact, a conformal eld theory (and if

not, what it ows to). moreover, it might be useful to nd a linear sigma model which

renormalizes to the above nonlinear model. this would be possible if the metric on t |p |

were given by a hyper-kahler quotient. thus, an interesting question raised by this work

is whether there is a sense in which the metric on t |p | induced by the calabi-yau metric

becomes the hyperkahler quotient metric in the limit of large p .

fourth, it would be nice to extend the discussion to vebranes with even less super-

symmetry, leaving a (0, 2) string. such congurations would appear if the m 5 worldvolume

is near a boundary, as in the horava-witten picture. at a formal level, much of the above

discussion generalizes to the (0, 2) case. however quantum corrections are expected to be

much more important here.

fifth , if the m -theory compactication has a heterotic dual then there must be a

description of the same strings in the heterotic picture. indeed, in the case x = k3  t 2

with p = k3 one reproduces the heterotic string itself [26,27]. however, in the case of p

dened by a class p with p large there will be a large number of left- and right-moving

degrees of freedom. because of the msw eect it is not obvious that these charges should

really be visible. we think this is worth understanding better.

appendix b. (2, 0) tensor multiplet

b.1. the conventions

in this section we work in six-dimensional minkowski space. the r-symmetry group

for the theory with sixteen real supercharges is so(5). let a = 1, ..., 5 (the index a is
so(5) euclidean) and  = 0, 1, ...5. a basis of gamma-matrices a in ve-dimensional

euclidean space can be constructed as follows:

6,7,8 =(cid:18) 0

in checking the susy transformations of the (2,0) multiplet of b.2 it is more convenient to
work in a slightly dierent basis than the one we used in 4.3 for gamma-matrices  in

(b.9), and ve scalars {x a, a = 6, ...10}. in other words, under the little group spin(4) 
u sp(4) ,  , , x a transform in the ((3, 1); 1), (4; 4), ((1, 1); 5) respectively. after the
elimination of the auxiliary eld introduced in the covariant formulation of the vebrane

appendix c. some remarks on kodaira-spencer theory

in this appendix we show (4.3). let x be a complex manifold with a divisor p. there

are two exact sheaf sequences which we are going to use

0  o(t p)  o(t x|p)  o(l|p)  0,

(c.1)

which is a sequence over p, and

0  o(t x  [p])  o(t x)  o(t x|p)  0,

(c.2)

which is a sequence over x. from the long exact sheaf-cohomology sequence associated to

(c.1) we obtain:

    h 0(p, o(t x|p)  h 0(p, o(l))  h 1(p, o(t p))  h 1(p, o(t x|p))    

(c.3)
since h 1(p, o(t p)) = h 0,1(t p), in order to show that the mapping (4.3) is injective, it
suces to show that h 0(p, o(t x|p)) = 0. for this we will use the following part of the

exact long sheaf-cohomology sequence associated to (c.2):

    h 0(x, o(t x))  h 0(p, o(t x|p))  h 1(x, o(t x  [p]))     ,

(c.4)

where we noted that h (x, o(t x|p)) = h (p, o(t x|p)). however h 0(x, o(t x)) =
h 0,0(t x) = h 2,0(x) = 0 (where the last equivalence can be seen using the existence of a
unique nowhere-vanishing holomorphic three-form on x). moreover using kodaira-serre

duality we have

h q(x, o(t x  [p])) = h 3q(x, 1(l)) = 0; q = 0, 1, 2,

(c.5)

where the last equality is due to the fact that l is associated to the very ample divi-

sor p, and we can take c1(l) to be arbitrarily large. thus it immediately follows from
(c.4) that h 0(p, o(t x|p)) = 0 and hence (4.3) is indeed injective. one can show that
h 1(p, o(t x|p)) = h 1(x, o(t x)) = h 0,1(t x) = h 2,1(x) 6= 0 so we cannot conclude
from (c.3) that (4.3) is surjective.

appendix d. d3 on k3 and the (4, 4) -model

although outside the main line of development of this paper, it is worthwhile discussing

the properties of (4, 4) models within the framework of this paper. for a recent account see

[28]. here we address some complementary issues. to obtain a (4, 4) model we will consider

a d3 wrapped on a holomorphic two-cycle (a riemann surface) p inside x = k3 (whenever

it doesnt lead to confusion, we will keep the same notation as for the corresponding

discussion in the case where x is a calabi-yau three-fold). this is a much simpler system

to analyze, since all the scalars coming from the reduction to the string world-sheet of the

d3-brane low-energy lagrangian, are non-chiral. the number of left and right-movers is

given by a formula similar to the one for the vebrane:

n b

l = n b

r = dp + b1(p) + 4

(d.1)

the (bosonic part of the) gauge theory on the worldvolume involves a vector eld a
and six scalars. when wrapped on the two-cycle, two scalars x 4, x 5 will parametrise the
deformations, yielding dp scalars on the string worldvolume, while the other four x 6  x 9
will form the universal supereld (here, in analogy to the discussion for the m 5, we consider
the d3-brane to be along x 0  x 3 while x is taken along x 2  x 5). in this case, the
universal supereld does not contain compact scalars, and is given simply by ir4. in its
turn, the vector eld gives rise to b1(p) scalars. note that the kahler form no longer
appears in our analysis of the scalar spectrum and the structure of the universal supereld

is considerably simpler. more precisely, the counting goes as follows

(p) =zcp

c1(p) = zx

p 2 = 2  b1(p),

(d.2)

where as before we have set p = c1(l) = c1(p). on the other hand

(l) =

(1)ihi(x, l) = h0(x, l), hi(x, l)  dimch i(x, l)

where the last equality follows from the fact that p is very ample, and

dimxxi=0
h0(x, l) =zx

taking (d.2) into account and the fact that (x) =rx c2(x) = 24 for x = k3, we nally

get

dp = b1(p) = 2d + 2,

(d.5)

where again dp stands for the real dimension of h 0(x, l) and d = 1
the (4, 4) action follows from the reduction of the born-infeld action for d3

let {i (), i = 1, . . . , 1

(d.8)

with {i} a basis of holomorphic sections of lp .

the c-map works in the same way as in the case of [7], and we obtain the result that

all the terms in the reduction of (d.6) come from a kahler potential of the form 7

again supersymmetry mixes the scalars eectively doubling the coordinates and yielding

e = (, ) + dij ij ; dij = i j ,

a target space of real dimension 2b1 = 4d + 4.

finally, the coupling of d3 to background rr elds gives rise to the -model b-eld.

in particular we have rd3 rrf  f, where the rr scalar has to be kept xed in the

d3 background. the discussion of the compactness of the target space as well as the

dependence of the -model data in terms of k3 geometry follows the generic calabi-yau

constructions.

7 to prove this, one should use i = (i )|(2,0)
p .
