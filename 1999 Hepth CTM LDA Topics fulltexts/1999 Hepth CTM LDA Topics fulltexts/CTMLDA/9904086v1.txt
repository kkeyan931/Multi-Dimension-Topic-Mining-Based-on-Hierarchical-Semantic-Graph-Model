i. introduction

according to the holographic principle [13], the bulk theory (with gravity) and the
boundary theory (without gravity) are equivalent. such correspondence gives insight into
one theory from the other. interest in the holographic principle is revived from the recent
observation [4] that the bulk gravity theory in the near horizon geometry of brane congura-
tion is equivalent to the boundary theory described by the corresponding worldvolume eld
theory in the decoupling limit. (the closely related previous works in refs. [5,6] study the
correspondence between the bulk theory on the ads space and the boundary supersingleton
eld theory.) in particular, when the near horizon geometry is the ads space, i.e. d3-brane,
m2-brane and m5-brane cases, the boundary theory is conformal. however, it is found out
in refs. [7,8] that even for other branes, whose near horizon geometry is not the ads type
and therefore the corresponding boundary theory is not a genuine conformal theory, one
can still dene generalized conformal theory.

the symmetry group of such generalized conformal theory can be manifestly seen in
the bulk theory in the so-called dual frame [5,6,911]. the dual frame is regarded as
a preferred frame for supergravity probes in the near horizon background of the source
branes. in this frame, the near horizon geometry of a p-brane supergravity solution takes
the adsp+2  sn form. the so(p + 1, 2) isometry of the adsp+2 part is realized in the
boundary theory as the generalized conformal symmetry of refs. [7,8]. the dual frame
is also called a holographic frame, since an uv/ir connection between the bulk and the
boundary theory is manifest in this frame.

in this paper, we study the d0-brane case of such generalized conformal theory. d0-
brane is particularly interesting for its relevance to m theory. an important discovery
of the m(atrix) model is that dicult problems of quantum m theory is reduced to non-
relativistic quantum mechanics. originally, it is conjectured [12] that m-theory in the innite
momentum frame (imf) [13] is exactly described by the u() d = 1 super-yang-mills
(sym) theory, which is the worldvolume theory of the bound state of the innite number
(n  ) of d0-branes. the d = 1 u(n) sym theory, which is the supersymmetric
matrix model description of the supermembrane theory [14], is nothing but the maximally
supersymmetric u(n) yang-mills theory dimensionally reduced from 9+1 to 0+1 dimensions
(i.e. n  n hermitian matrix quantum mechanics). it is further conjectured [15] that the
equivalence of (m)atrix theory to m-theory is also valid for a nite n. the conjecture
states that m-theory compactied on a light-like circle with nite momentum along the
circle is exactly described by a u(n) matrix theory. the quantization of such theory is
called the discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq). one can think of this light-like circle
as a small space-like circle that is boosted by a large amount [16]. just like m-theory in
the imf, m-theory in the light-cone frame (lcf) is described purely by d0-branes with
positive momentum and has the galilean invariance in the transverse space [15]. therefore,
m-theory on a light-like circle can be viewed as a theory of the nite number of d0-branes
in the low velocity (non-relativistic) limit.

this idea can also be understood from the bulk/boundary duality as follows. when com-
pactied on a light-like circle, the supergravity m-wave solution (viewed as the supergraviton
with the momentum number n) becomes the near horizon limit of supergravity solution for
n coinciding d0-branes [17]. since m-theory in the lcf in the supergravity solution level

2

is related to the near horizon limit of the supergravity d0-brane solution, by the generalized
ads/cft duality [18,7,8] m-theory in the lcf has to be related to the boundary theory of
the bound state of n d0-branes. this boundary theory is the maximally supersymmetric
su(n) yang-mills theory dimensionally reduced from 9 + 1 to 0 + 1 dimensions, as stated
in the (m)atrix theory conjecture.

in this paper, we view the non-relativistic (matrix) quantum mechanics of bound states
of d0-brane as a system of the probe d0-brane moving in the background of large number of
source d0-brane bound state. this view of (m)atrix model is also taken in ref. [17], which
reproduces the (m)atrix model graviton-graviton scattering calculation from the eective
action for a probe moving in the background of the m-wave supergravity solution.
it is
further shown in refs. [7,8] that the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action for a radially moving
probe d0-brane in the background of the source d0-brane bound state can also be determined
by imposing the generalized conformal symmetry of the boundary theory, which is just the
d = 1 u(n) sym theory describing the m theory in the lcf.

the quantum mechanics of the probe d0-brane in the near horizon background of the
source d0-brane is a reminiscence of the conformal quantum mechanics of the charged test
particle moving in the near horizon background of the d = 4 extreme reissner-nordstrom
black hole studied in ref. [19]. the radial motion of such test particle is described by the
relativistic conformal quantum mechanics with the sl(2, r) = su(1, 1) symmetry. this
is a generalized version of (non-relativistic) conformal mechanics studied in refs. [20,21].
one can view such generalized conformal mechanics of the radial motion of the test particle
as the boundary conformal eld theory counterpart of the bulk gravity theory in the near
horizon ads2 geometry of the extreme reissner-nordstrom black hole, since the so(1, 2) =
su(1, 1) isometry of the ads2 space is realized as the symmetry of the dynamics of the test
particle in the spacetime with one lower dimension. since the near horizon geometry of the
source d0-brane supergravity solution in the dual frame is ads2  s 8, one would expect
that the dynamics of the probe d0-brane in this background has the sl(2, r) = so(2, 1)
symmetry.
in the d0-brane case, since this symmetry does not extend to the genuine
conformal symmetry of the boundary theory but only to the so-called generalized conformal
symmetry [7,8] as pointed out in the above, the quantum mechanics of the probe d0-brane
will have a generalized conformal symmetry.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we summarize the properties of the near
horizon geometry of the supergravity d0-brane solution. in section 3, we study the gener-
alized conformal quantum mechanics of d0-brane, elaborating its relation to m theory as
pointed out in the above.

ii. d0-brane solution in the near horizon region

in this section, we survey aspects of the d0-brane supergravity solution and its near

horizon geometry, illuminating their relations.

the string-frame type-iia eective supergravity action for d0-brane solution is given by

s =

16g10 z d10x

gstr[e2(rstr + 2m m )

fm n f m n ],

(1)

where g10 is the 10-dimensional gravitational constant, rstr and gstr are the ricci scalar
and the determinant for the the string-frame metric tensor gstr
m n ,  is the dilaton in the
ns-ns sector and fm n is the eld strength for the rr 1-form potential am that d0-branes
couple to.

the supergravity solution for the d0-brane has the following form:

str = gstr
e = gsh

m n dxm dxn = h

9),

1 + . . . + dx2
q

r(cid:19)7
r7  1 +(cid:18)

,

(2)

where gs is the string coupling constant, which is just the vacuum expectation value or the
asymptotic value of the dilaton e. here, the d0-brane charge q is related to the string
theory quantities as

7

q = ()

(3)
where  is related to the string length scale ls as ls =  and n is the number of the
d0-branes. by expanding the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action for the d0-brane to the lowest
order in , one nds the following relation of the string theory quantities to the yang-mills
gauge coupling gy m :

2 gsn,

g2
y m =

.

(4)

therefore, the constant q in the harmonic function is rewritten in terms of the sym quan-
tities as q = 7 = ()5g2

y m n.

in order to decouple the massive string modes (whose masses are proportional to 1/)
and the gravity modes (whose strength goes as g2
s ()4) from the massless open string modes,
which describe the yang-mills theory, one has to take   0, while keeping gy m as a nite
constant, which means for the d0-brane case gs  0 as well (cf. eq. (4)). furthermore, the
above metric (2) can be regarded as the gravitational eld felt by a probe d0-brane in the
background of the collection of n numbers of source d0-branes with the radial coordinate r
being interpreted as the distance between and probe and source d0-branes [22]. so, in order
to keep the mass mstring = r/ of the state of open string, which stretches between the
source and the probe, nite, one has also take the limit r  0 while keeping the following
combination as a nite constant:

u 

r
 ,

(5)

thereby going to the near horizon region of the supergravity solution (2). this combination
also corresponds to the conventional super-yang-mills scalar i = x i/l2
s, whose vacuum
expectation value sets the energy scale. in this decoupling limit, the supergravity solution
(2) takes the following form:

(9)

the radius 0  q/(()5u 3) of the would-be ads space depends on the coordinate u.
however, with the suitable choice of frame, called the dual frame [5,6,11], the spacetime
metric in the near-horizon region takes the ads2  s 8 form. namely, if one applies the
weyl transformation 1 on the metric as gstr

by further redening the radial coordinate as r = ( 25

one can bring the metric to the following standard ads2  s 8 form in the horospherical

explicit dependence on n .

on the other hand, one can view the d0-brane solution (2) as being magnetically charged
under the hodge-dual eld strength to the eld strength of the 1-form potential in the rr
sector. namely, the supergravity solution (2) solves the equations of motion of the following
eective action and is magnetically charged under the 7-form potential am1 m7:

(13)

where fm1 m8 is the eld strength of the 7-form potential am1 m7. in the dual frame with
the spacetime metric gdual

as in ref. [11], if one properly includes the factor involving n in the weyl transformation
of the metric, i.e. gstr
m n , then the new radial coordinate u (with
which the near horizon metric takes the ads form in the horospherical coordinates) is related
to u as u = 2
gy m n 1/2 . this is reminiscence of the holographic uv/ir connection between
the bulk and the boundary theory [23,24], if one identies u with the energy scale e of the
boundary theory [11].

where u0 = 2/5. from this solution, one can see that there is an spontaneous compacti-
cation [25] on s 8 of the d = 10 action (15) to the following 2-dimensional eective gauged
supergravity action [11]:

s  = n 2z d2xg(ne)

(17)

the near-horizon d0-brane supergravity solution (16) is reduced under this s 8 compacti-
cation to a domain solution [2628], which is supported by the cosmological term in the
action (17).

iii. generalized conformal mechanics of d0-branes

we consider a probe d0-brane with mass m and charge q moving in the near horizon
geometry of the source n d0-brane bound state. the gravitational eld felt by the probe
d0-brane in the string [dual] frame is given by eqs. (6) and (9) [eqs. (10) and (11)]. here,
once again, r is the radial distance between the source and the probe d0-branes. the probe
d0-brane moves with the 10-momentum p = (pm ) = (pt, p1, ..., p9) and its time-component
is the (static-gauge) hamiltonian h = pt. the expression for the hamiltonian of the probe
d0-brane in the near horizon background of the source d0-brane can be obtained by solving
the mass-shell constraint of the probe d0-brane.

unlike the case of ref. [19], which studies a charged particle in the einstein-maxwell
theory, the probe d0-brane satises the mass-shell constraint which is dierent from the
ordinary constraint 0 = (p qa)2 + m2 = gm n (pm  qam )(pn  qan ) + m2. this is due to
the non-trivial dilaton eld that is present for the d0-brane solution. so, here we rederive
the mass-shell condition for the case of d0-branes. the action for the probe d0-brane with
the mass m and the charge q moving in the background of the source d0-brane has the
following form:

s = z d l = z d (cid:18)meqgstr

m n xm xn  q xm am(cid:19) ,

(18)

d

where vm = xm  dxm
is the 10-velocity of the probe d0-brane. note, since we choose the
static gauge for the action, the worldline time  and the target-space time t are set to equal.
once again, gstr
m n and am are the elds produced by the source d0-brane. note, in this
action the metric gstr
m n is in the string frame. the (generalized) momentum conjugate to
xm ( ) is

pm = 

l
 xm =

me xm

qgstr

m n xm xn

+ qam .

(19)

as usual, pm = m xm /qgstr

m n xm xn is the ordinary 10-momentum of the d0-brane. from
this, one obtains the following mass-shell constraint for the probe d0-brane in the string-
frame background of the probe d0-brane:

gstr m n (pm  qam )(pn  qan ) + m2e2 = 0.

(20)

7

to obtain the expression for the hamiltonian h = pt for the probe d0-brane mechan-
ics, we solve this mass-shell constraint (20). we consider the following general spherically
symmetric d = 10 metric ansatz:

gm n dxm dxn = a(r)dt2 + b(r)dr2 + c(r)d2
3 + 2

= a(r)dt2 + b(r)dr2 + c(r)[d2 + cos2 d2

+ cos2  cos2 1 cos2 2d2

i d2
i ],

1 + cos2  cos2 1d2

2

(21)

where

1 = sin , 2 = cos  sin 1, 3 = cos  cos 1 sin 2, 4 = cos  cos 1 cos 2 sin 3. (22)

then, the expression for the hamiltonian h takes the following form:

(25)

first, we consider the probe d0-brane moving in the string-frame near horizon back-
ground of the source d0-brane. in the original work [19] of the superconformal mechanics of
a test charged particle in the near horizon geometry of the reissner-nordstrom black hole,
it was necessary to redene the radial coordinate so that the metric components a and b
in eq. (21) satisfy the relation a = b2 for the purpose of setting the factor a
2 b in eq.
(23) equal to 1. however, in the d0-brane case, as we will see, it is more convenient to work
with the original form (6) of near horizon metric, since the expression for the hamiltonian
becomes simpler in the original radial coordinate.

1

by substituting the string-frame near horizon metric into the general formulae (23) and
(24), one obtains the following hamiltonian for the probe d0-brane in the string-frame near
horizon background of the source d0-brane bound state:

t e2 in eq. (24) becomes 1 for the near horizon d0-brane
it is interesting that the term a1a2
solution (6). so, the expressions for f and g becomes greatly simplied. and, in particular,
in the extreme limit (m  q  0) of the probe d0-brane, the rst term in g drops out. this
also generally holds for any dilatonic 0-brane supergravity solutions.
just as in the case of the test charged particle in the reissner-nordsrom black hole
background, the mechanics of the probe d0-brane has the sl(2, r) symmetry with the
following generators:

h =

r
2f

+

g
2f

, k =

2

f r2, d =

2

rpr,

(30)

where the hamiltonian h generates the time translation, k generates the special conformal
transformation and d generates the scale transformation or the dilatation. these generators
satisfy the following sl(2, r) algebra:

[d, h] = h,

[d, h] = k,

[h, k] = 2d.

(31)

this is the d0-brane generalization of conformal quantum mechanics studied in refs.
[20,21,19].

in fact, the near horizon solution (6), when uplifted as a solution of the 11-dimensional
the 11-dimensional plane wave solution), is invariant under the su(1, 1) =
gravity (i.e.
sl(2, r) isometry 2 generated by the scale transformation d, the special coordinate trans-
formation k and the time translation h [7]. under the time translation, ht = 1, h u = 0
and h gs = 0. under the special coordinate transformation, kt = (t2+k g2
u 5 ), ku = 2tu
and kgs = 6tgs. finally, under the dilatation, dt = t, du = u and dgs = 3gs. and at

y m

2at the 10-dimensional level, such sl(2, r) transformations act on the near-horizon supergravity
d0-brane solution in such a way that the constant q in the harmonic function h transforms as if
it is a eld on the worldvolume and then is set to a constant after the transformations [8].

9

transforms as a conformal eld of dimension 1. these innitesimal transformations satisfy
the following sl(2, r) algebra just like the symmetry generators (30) of the probe d0-brane
mechanics:

[d, h ] = h,

[d, k] = k,

[h, k] = 2d.

(32)

note, the string coupling gs changes under the dilatation and the special coordinate
transformation, and especially gs becomes time dependent after the special coordinate trans-
formation is applied. thereby, this sl(2, r) isometry of the near horizon geometry does not
extend to a conformal symmetry of the complete supergravity solution. the corresponding
boundary theory, i.e. 0 + 1 dimensional sym matrix quantum mechanics, has the same
sl(2, r) symmetry, but the string coupling gs also transforms under this symmetry, unlike
the case of d3-brane. however, as noted in ref. [7], since the dilaton coupling gs is related to
the matrix model coupling constant, one can still think of generalized sl(2, r) conformal
symmetry in which the string coupling is now regarded as a part of background elds that
transform under the symmetry. the generalized conformal symmetry therefore transforms
a matrix model at one value of the coupling constant to another. note, as pointed out in
the previous section, d0-brane in the dual frame has description in terms of domain-wall
solution after the compactication on s 8. so, this is also related to the fact that in the
domain-wall/qft correspondence the choice of horosphere (the hypersurface of constant u)
for the minkowski vacuum corresponds to a choice of coupling constant of a non-conformal
qft [11]. in the non-conformal case, the interpolation between the ads killing horizon (in
the dual frame) and its boundary therefore corresponds to an interpolation between strong
and weak coupling, or vice versa.

the extreme limit of the probe d0-brane ((m  q)  0) can be interpreted as the m
theory in the lcf, since in this case both the source and the probe d0-branes are in the
bps limit. in this case, the functions f and g are simplied to

unlike the case of a charged test particle in the near horizon reissner-nordsrom black hole
background studied in ref. [19], we do not let the mass of the source d0-brane bound state
go to innity, since the number n of the d0-branes in the m theory on the lcf is kept nite.
the fact that we are considering the near horizon geometry of the d0-brane supergravity
solution means that we are in the lcf of m theory, since the near horizon geometry of the
d0-brane supergravity solution is also the null reduction of the m wave supergravity solution
[17], which is interpreted as m theory in the lcf. taking n to innity, i.e. innitely massive
source d0-brane, corresponds to m theory in the imf. note, the imf is dened as the limit
in which n and r11 go to innity such that the momentum p11 = n/r11 also goes to

10

y m n 1/21  u  g2/3

y m n 1/4u 21/4 and r11  g7/2

innity. since p11  g7/2
y m n 3/4u 21/4, one can take both p11 and
r11 to innity while taking n  , if u is in the range of g2/3
y m n 1/7.
however, this range of u is beyond the range of validity (8) of the near horizon solution (6).
in other words, one cannot go to the imf of m theory while keeping the parameters within
the validity of the near horizon solution (6). anyway, the imf means decompactication
(r11  ) to the eleven dimensions. so, we should rather consider the m wave solution in
the case n  .
by expanding this hamiltonian for an extreme d0-brane probe, one obtains a hamil-
tonian of the form which is the sum of the non-relativistic kinetic term for the probe and
the velocity dependent potential given by the sum of terms of the form  v2n+2
(n  z+).
this should reproduce the (m)atrix theory calculation of graviton-graviton scattering and
its supergravity calculation reproduction of ref. [17]. this is because the above action (18)
is just the reduction of the action for the probe in the background of d = 11 plane wave
(describing the motion of the probe graviton in the background of the moving heavy source
graviton) on a light-like circle to 10 dimensions, i.e. m theory in the lcf. note also that
since m theory in the lcf has galilean invariance (or is described by non-relativistic
quantum mechanics) in the transverse space, the above hamiltonian for an extreme probe
d0-brane has the non-relativistic structure. these above arguments, together with the fact
that the generalized conformal mechanics of probe d0-brane and the boundary su(n) sym
theory (i.e. the (m)atrix model of m theory in the lcf) satisfy the same sl(2, r) symme-
try, implies the equivalence between the (m)atrix model with nite n and the generalized
conformal mechanics of d0-brane.

next, we consider the probe d0-brane moving in the background of the dual-frame metric
of the source d0-brane bound state. since the dual frame can be considered as a holographic
frame describing supergravity probes [11], it is worthwhile to consider the case of the dual
frame. in this frame, the near horizon metric takes the ads2  s 8 form. so, one should
expect that the generalized conformal mechanics with the sl(2, r) symmetry can also be
realized in the dual frame. the action for the probe d0-brane in the dual frame background
of the source d0-brane is given by (18) with the string-frame metric gstr
m n replaced by the
dual-frame metric gdual
m n . so, for the probe d0-brane
in the dual frame, the dilaton factor e in eqs. (18) and (19) [the dilaton factor e2 in
eqs. (20) and (24)] is replaced by e

m n through the relation gstr

substituting the dual-frame near horizon solution (10) into this general expression for
the hamiltonian corresponding to the dual frame, one nds that the hamiltonian in the dual
frame has the same form as the string-frame hamiltonian (26) with the same f and g (27).
in fact, in general the hamiltonian describing probe d0-brane is independent of the near
horizon spacetime frame of the source d0-brane. so, the dynamics of the probe d0-brane
in the dual frame also has the sl(2, r) symmetry with the same symmetry generators (30)
and algebra (31) as the string-frame case.

as pointed out in the previous section, the source d0-brane solution also has the (hodge)
dual description in terms of the 8-form eld strength, whose magnetic charge now is carried
by the source d0-brane. in this case, by compactifying the d0-brane solution on s 8 one
obtains a domain wall solution in 1 + 1 dimensions [28,11]. this domain wall solution solves
the equations of motion of a d = 2 so(9) gauged maximal supergravity theory, which is an

11

s 8 compactication of the type iia supergravity. this so(9), which is the largest subgroup
of the so(16) and the isometry group of s 8 upon which the d0-brane is compactied, is
also the r-symmetry group of the corresponding boundary d = 1 qft. in general, the
r-symmetry of the supersymmetric qft on the domain wall worldvolume matches the
gauge group, which is the isometry group of the compactication manifold, of the equivalent
gauged supergravity [11].

putting together all the above facts, namely (i) generalized conformal mechanics of
the probe d0-brane in the string-frame near horizon background of the source d0-brane
is related to the m theory in the lcf, (ii) the generalized conformal mechanics of the
probe d0-branes in the string and the dual frames of the near horizon source d0-branes are
described by the same hamiltonian, (iii) upon the dimensional reduction on s 8 the bulk
theory of the source d0-brane in the dual frame in the hodge-dual description (in terms
of the 8-form eld strength) is the d = 2 so(9) gauged maximal supergravity theory, one
arrives at the speculation that the m theory in the lcf is related to the d = 2 so(9)
gauged maximal supergravity theory (i.e. a d = 2 kaluza-klein supergravity theory with
domain wall vacuum).
