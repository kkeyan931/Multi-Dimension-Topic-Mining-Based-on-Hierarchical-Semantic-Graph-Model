(14) additional non-zero charge q5, bps bounds two conditions e |q2 + q5| e |q2 q5|. either bounds saturated, 1/4 supersymmetry preserved. example, membrane vebrane, {q, q} = diag(0, 2q2, 2(q2 + q5), 2q5) 1l8 (15) 8 zero eigenvalues. supersymmetry preserved intersection pre- served membranes vebranes; case 01 = 012345 = (16) adding vebrane membrane halved membranes supersymme- tries leave 1/4 supersymmetry. however, second vebrane added 16789 directions without breaking supersymmetry, corresponding pro- jection 016789 = supersymmetry parameter already implied conditions (16). indeed add third positive charge q 5 preserve 8 supersymmetries energy saturates bps bound, e = q2 + q5 + q 5. refer usual bps intersection (2, 5, 5) system extensively studied literature. identical analysis goes (2, 5, 5) take e = q2 q5 q 5, (2, 5, 5) take e = q2 + q5 q 5 (2, 5, 5) take e = q2 q5 + q 5; case, start two branes intersecting preserving 1/4 supersymmetry, add third free without breaking. returning (2, 5) system preserving 8 supersymmetries, adding anti-vebrane 016789 = instead vebrane give (2, 5, 5) conguration would appear break original 8 supersymmetries membrane-vebrane system, but, shall show, bps bound leads 8 supersymmetries energy saturates bound. 7 (these dierent 8-dimensional subset 32 values charges 8 values.) situation (2, 5, 5), (2, 5, 5) (2, 5, 5) systems; case two three branes preserve 8 supersymme- tries, third brane appears break 8 supersymmetries, nonetheless 8 supersymmetries would preserved bound saturated. moreover, 1/4 supersymmetric bps state exists, tuning charges particular values enhances number supersymmetries 16 exotic value 24. general charges useful contrast analysis congurations related switching branes anti-branes focus (2, 5, 5) (2, 5, 5) systems. mind return (12) (13) rst consider (2, 5, 5) case charges positive. clearly 1 = q2 + q5 + q bps bound e q2 + q5 + q 5 saturated preserve 1/4 supersymmetry; usual case considered above. analyse (2, 5, 5) case 5 largest eigenvalue hence charges negative, useful rewrite (13) 5 1 = q2 + q5 + q 2 = (q2 + q5 + q 3 = (q2 + q5 + q 4 = (q2 + q5 + q 5) + 2q 5 5) + 2q5 5) + 2q2 (17) one 2, 3, 4 biggest eigenvalue positive, since 1 negative sum eigenvalues zero. example, 0 q5 q 5, 0 q5 q2 (18) 2 biggest bps bound e (q2 + q5 + q saturated 5) + 2q5. bound {q, q} = diag(2(q2 + q 5), 0, 2(q5 q 5), 2(q5 q2)) 1l8 (19) 1/4 supersymmetry would preserved. obtain exotic preservation 1/2 3/4 supersymmetry need tune charges: 1/2 supersymmetry preserved either q5 = q 5 q5 = q2 3/4 supersymmetry preserved q5 = q 5 = q2. 8 thus, (2, 5, 5) system charges satisfying (18), lowest energy allowed supersymmetry e = (q2 + q5 + q energy, would preserve 1/4 supersymmetry generic values 5) + 2q5. ground state system indeed charges, two charges equal, 1/2 supersymmetry would preserved three charges equal, 3/4 supersymmetry would preserved. similar results follow cases 3 4 biggest. obtain insight, continue case charges satisfying (18), 2 largest eigenvalue. specic 8 supersymmetries would preserved preserved two intersecting branes (2, 5). interesting two branes contributing energy positively vebrane contributing negatively. recall add vebrane, q5 positive, (2, 5) obtain (2, 5, 5) conguration, usual case preservation 1/4 su- persymmetry obtained e = (q2 + q 5) + q5. new point add instead anti-vebrane, q5 negative, get (2, 5, 5) system still preserve supersymmetry e = (q2 + q 5) + q5, long q5 q q5 q2. either case, naive energy would sum energies three branes, i.e. en = |q2| + |q5| + |q 5|. correct result usual 1/4 supersymmetric (2, 5, 5) case, exotic (2, 5, 5) case energy state saturating bound would e = en v v = 2|q5|, suggesting v might interpreted kind binding energy tachyonic contribution. 5 finally, note conditions (18) satised, either 3 4 largest eigenvalue adding anti-vebrane (2, 5) break original 8 supersymmetries lead dierent 8 supersymmetries preserved. 3.2 tachyon condensation perhaps worth comparing case coincident brane/anti-brane pairs. argued d-branes anti-d-branes completely annihilate leave vacuum energy e = mt + mt v = 0 energy single brane contribution v = 2mt arises negative potential energy released tachyon condensation . duality implies also apply 9 brane/anti-brane pairs m-theory string theory, completely annihilate. tachyon condensation reduces energy minimum allowed bps bound, case zero brane/anti-brane pair carries net charge. adding n branes obtain n + branes anti-branes, anti-branes completely annihilate branes leave n branes energy e = nt , written e = en v en = (2m + n)t naive energy given sums energies individual branes anti-branes v = 2mt . two coincident p-branes charges q, q, naive energy system would sum energies respective branes, en = |q| + |q|. correct energy q, q sign, either branes anti-branes. however, charges opposite sign one brane anti- brane (e.g. q = (n + m)t q = mt case above), resulting conguration e = |q + q| = en v v = 2 min(|q|,|q|). suggestively similar case considered 2 largest eigen- value. (2, 5) system enters energy formulae exactly way 5-brane charge q5 = (q2 + q 5) would. adding vebrane positive charge q5 gives system e = q5 + q5, adding anti-vebrane negative charge q5 = q gives system e = q5 q v = 2q. generally, product brane charges positive, naive energy sum energies branes en=|q2| + |q5| + |q 5| congurations preserve 1/4 supersymmetry. product charges negative, exotic preservation supersymmetry possible naive energy modied e = en 2min(|q2|,|q5|,|q 5|). suggests tachyon condensation could play role also, reducing energy sum brane energies. seems plausible could indeed case reduces energy minimum allowed supersymmetry. 3.3 string-theory m-theory example m2-brane two m5-branes related duality many congurations three branes string theory m-theory. example, related type ii conguration dp-brane, d(8-p) brane fundamental 10 string intersecting point, dp-brane directions 1, 2, ..., p, d(8-p) brane directions p + 1, p + 2, ..., 8 fundamental string 9th direction, conguration d5-brane 12345 directions, ns5-brane 12678 directions d3-brane 129 directions studied hanany witten {$9611230$}. case usual 1/4 supersymmetric conguration one three branes added free, exotic conguration obtained reversing orientation one branes, three branes, bps state would preserve 1/4 supersymmetry generic charges 1/2 3/4 supersymmetry two three charges equal magnitude. congurations d-branes, methods  cannot directly used test possibility tachyon condensation leading exotic bps states. 4 conclusion shown supersymmetry algebra allows congurations preserving exotic amounts supersymmetry identied simple congurations charges m-theory eld theories state lowest energy allowed supersymmetry would preserve 3/4 supersymmetry, able es- tablish whether states actually occur. unable nd d=11 supergravity solutions 24 killing spinors, corresponding 3/4 supersymme- try. known supersymmetric supergravity solutions two (anti)-vebranes (anti)-membrane either preserve 1/4 none supersymmetry . take mass parameters associated harmonic generalised harmonic functions individual branes positive. product three charges positive (for example, (2, 5, 5) (2, 5, 5) congurations), solutions 8 killing spinors corresponding 1/4 supersymmetry. product charges negative, (for example, (2, 5, 5) conguration), known supergravity solutions actually break supersymmetry. vary signs mass parameters obtain solutions killing spinors1. also possible prove 3/4 supersymmetric classical solutions wess-zumino model exist, even though 1this point also discussed {$9705162$}. 11 supersymmetry would allowed {$9702163$}. examples, spatial dimensions transverse branes situations number subtleties arise, nonetheless analysis recover known cases supersymmetric intersections. congurations identied parameterised three charges. generic values charges, bps state would preserve 1/4 supersymmetry, special values two three charges equal, bps state would preserve 1/2 3/4 supersymmetry, respectively. conjectured string theory m-theory, tachyon condensation could play role reducing energy minimum allowed bps bound, brane/anti-brane pair. would interesting either establish exotic states occur certain theories, or, dont exist, understand reason this, given supersymmetry appears allow them. hope return issues future. acknowledgements: thank gary gibbons, je harvey, michael douglas, david tong paul townsend helpful discussions.
