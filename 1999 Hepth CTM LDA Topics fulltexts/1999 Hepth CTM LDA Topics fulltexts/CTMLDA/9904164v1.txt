we investigate the consequence of the energy-momentum conservation law for the

holographic s-matrix from ads/cft correspondence. it is shown that the conservation

law is not a natural consequence of conformal invariance in the large n limit. we predict

a new singularity for the four point correlation function of a marginal operator. only the

two point scattering amplitude is explicitly calculated, and the result agrees with what is

expected.

1. introduction and intuitive observation

although there exist several nonperturbative formulations of m theory and string

theory in a at spacetime, it has been hard to do a quantitative calculation in the right

regime where the formulation is supposed to be valid. this diculty has to do with the

unusual physics which is required of a holographic theory [1]. the most recent proposal is

an explicit ansatz for the s-matrix in the at space limit using a convolution of conformal

correlators in the boundary conformal eld theory [2,3], for a related discussion, see [4]. a

few puzzling aspects are already pointed out within this context in [5].

the ansatz of [2,3] involves taking a peculiar high energy limit along with a large n
limit. for instance, the type iib string theory dened on r10 is encoded in the super yang-
mills theory on s3r in the large n limit. of course the whole theory may not exist in the
large n limit when the yang-mills coupling constant is held xed. the conjecture of [2,3]

rather asserts that a certain subsector must exist. if one possesses innite calculational

power to calculate all the relevant correlation functions in sym, the iib string s-matrix

can be constructed nonperturbatively.

of course for the time-being we are not yet that powerful. on the contrary, the mal-

dacena conjecture [6] has been used to make predictions about the sym theory. although

we do not know much about the nonperturbative s-matrix, a few principles are certainly

applicable. traditionally, very general principles such as lorentz invariance, unitarity and

analyticity constitute strong constraints on the s-matrix. we expect that these constraints

transform into the ones on a subset of correlation functions in sym via the holographic

s-matrix ansatz. our purpose in this paper is to point out that the simplest consequence of

lorentz invariance, the energy-momentum conservation law, is not a bona de consequence

of conformal invariance. notice that the isometry of the anti-de sitter space is the confor-

mal group. taking the large radius limit, the conformal group contracts to the poincare

group. rather surprisingly, already at the level of the 4 point amplitude, implementation

of energy-momentum conservation requires the existence of a new type of singularity in

the 4 point correlation functions in the large n limit. this singularity, to our knowledge,

is not dictated by conformal symmetry.

in order to extract information about physical process happening in the center of the

anti-de sitter space, well-focused wave packets must be prepared. a precise ansatz for

an incoming particle or an outgoing particle is given in [2]. we will focus on massless

particles, for we will work with the type iib string theory, and the only stable states are

1

those of supergraviton. denote the creation operator of an incoming particle by e,
where  = re is the dimensionless energy, r is the radius of ads5, and e is a unit 4

vector. this particle carries a momentum e tangent to ads5 in its center. the state is
smeared over s5, or it carries a zero momentum in the internal space. similarly, denote

the annihilation operator of an outgoing particle by e+. for a scalar particle, the ansatz

of [2] is

e = 3/2z dtd exp{
e+ = 3/2z dtd exp{


2

2

[(t + /2)2 + |x + e|2]  i(t + /2)}o(t, x),
[(t  /2)2 + |x  e|2] + i(t  /2)}o(t, x),

(1.1)

where o is the appropriate operator corresponding to the scalar eld [7,8,9]. for the dila-
ton, it is proportional to trf 2, for the axion, it is proportional to trf f . we assumed that
o is properly normalized, so some  independent numerical factors in [2] were dropped.
the integral r d is over the unit s3 which is parameterized by x.
the above ansatz clearly indicates that the incoming (outgoing) particle originates
(ends up) at time /2 (/2). in the large r limit, the proper time goes to . the
gaussian factor helps to focus the beam in the direction e. a s-matrix element is given

by

s = lim
n

1hyi

eiyj

ej +i,

(1.2)

where  is a normalization factor. for a xed string coupling constant, due to the relation
r4 = 4gsn 2, the large r limit is achieved by taking the large n limit.

in a conformal eld theory, both the two point functions and three point functions

are xed up to a numerical coecient by conformal symmetry. one would expect that the

calculation of the two point amplitudes and three point amplitudes using eqs.(1.1), (1.2) is

a simple matter. actually, as shown in the next section, an exact form of three amplitude

can be obtained only after some tedious calculation. in this section we will be content

with a qualitative examination of these amplitudes.

the geometry s3  r is conformal to r4, so correlation functions on s3  r can be
obtained from those on r4 using the conformal transformation. for instance, the euclidean
distance between the two points x and y, r2 = |x  y|2 is mapped to

exp(x + y) (cosh(x  y)  x  y) ,

(1.3)

2

where we parametrize r4 by the radial coordinates r = exp  and the unit sphere s3. x
and y are unit 4 vectors. now  and x parametrize s3  r.

in a correlation function, the extra factors such as exp(1 + 2) are removed by a con-
formal factor. if f (r2
ij) is a correlation function on r4, then the corresponding correlation
function on s3  r is obtained by simply replacing r2
ij with cosh(i  j)  xi  xj . to
obtain the correlation function on a minkowskian s3  r, we wick-rotate  to it, and add
a term i:

r2
ij = cos(ti  tj)  xi  xj + i,

(1.4)

where the i prescription is introduced to ensure causality in the boundary conformal
theory. to see this, assume ti  tj small, and the angle ij between xi and xj small, we
obtain

1
2



(ti  tj)2 +

1
2

2
ij + i,

(1.5)

we see that if one uses r2
light-cone for a positive energy mode of the form exp(it).

ij as the propagator, the signal will propagate along the future

the scaling dimension of an operator corresponding to a massless scalar eld is  = 4.

the two point function is therefore

ho(t1, x1)o(t2, x2)i = (cos(t1  t2)  x1  x2 + i)4

(1.6)

up to a normalization constant.

the two point scattering amplitude is obtained using (1.2). without taking the large

n and high energy limit, there is no energy-momentum conservation, since as shown in the

appendix of [2], the incoming an well as outgoing waves have nite width in both energy
and momentum. the width of  is proportional to . using  = re, the width of
e is proportional to pe/r and goes to zero in the large r limit. so energy-momentum

conservation has to be recovered in this limit. we shall show in the next section that the

energy conservation is always guaranteed in this limit.

however, the momentum conservation rather imposes strong constraints on the be-

havior of conformal correlators in the large n limit. as we will see in the next section,

the convolution of (1.2) using ansatz (1.1) is rather subtle. to obtain the exact numerical

answer, one cannot simply replace the gaussian distribution of (1.1) by a simpler one,

say a delta function. to see the momentum conservation, though, we will do this in this

section.

3

in the case of two point amplitude, replacing the gaussian wave packets by delta

functions, we obtain

(1  e1  e2)4.

(1.7)

together with a factor depending on i, we will have a null result if e1  e2 6= 1. the above
expression is singular if e1  e2 = 1 or equivalently e1 = e2. thus we hope that a more
careful calculation will result a delta function 3(e1  e2) for the two point amplitude.
here we dene the delta function by

z 3(e1  e2)d2 = 1.

together with the energy conservation 1 = 2, or e1 = e2, this implies the momentum
conservation e1e1 = e2e2. the conservation is due to the fact that the two point conformal
correlation function is singular if one point sits on the future light-cone of the other point.
the three point correlation function of operator o is xed by conformal invariance.

again up to a constant, it is

ho(t1, x1)o(t2, x2)o(t3, x3)i = (cos(t1  t2)  x1  x2 + i)2
(cos(t2  t3)  x2  x3 + i)2(cos(t1  t3)  x1  x3 + i)2.

(1.8)

consider the case where two states are incoming, one is outgoing. the gaussian wave
packets force t1,2 to center around /2, and t3 to center around /2. if we simply replace
the gaussian wave packets by delta functions, the above expression becomes

(1  e1  e2)2(1  e2  e3)2(1  e1  e3)2.

(1.9)

this function is singular whenever ei = ej for i 6= j. it is most singular when all ei are
equal. thus we expect that a more careful treatment will lead to delta functions forcing

all ei to be equal. indeed this is the consequence of momentum conservation for a three
point amplitude involving only massless particles: that all momenta of outlegs must be

collinear. this is most easily seen in the following physical way. if, say, the two incoming

states are not collinear, then one can go to the center of mass frame in which the end

product of the scattering can never be a single massless particle.

mathematically, the above result, as in the two point amplitude case, is a consequence

of causality in the boundary theory: whenever two points are separated by a null geodesics,

then the correlation function becomes singular. for the three point function, it is most

singular when they lie on the same light-cone.

4

this raises a puzzle already at the level of the three point amplitudes. imagine that

there are stable massive particles. in this case the three point correlation is still given by
a formula similar to (1.8) if one replaces 2 by (i + j  k)/2, if the particles carry
zero momentum in the internal space s5. again the correlation function becomes singular

when ei and ej are equal, provided i + j > k. however this has nothing to do with
the momentum conservation for massive particles. it is therefore quite interesting to note

that there are no stable massive stringy states in the type iib theory. thus this puzzle is

avoided. a related feature is that the conformal dimension of a stringy state is divergent

in the large n limit [7,8], thus although the convolution (1.2) exists for nite n, its large

n limit does not exist.

it is more interesting to see what happens to the four point correlation function when

the momentum conservation is imposed. the four point correlation function of operator
o of scaling dimension 4 can not be xed by conformal symmetry alone. up to a scaling
factor, it is a function of two independent cross-ratios. dene the cross-ratios

the correlation function can be written as, for instance

ho(t1, x1) . . .o(t4, x4) = f4(r2
ij)
= yi<j4

r8/3
ij

f (a, b),

(1.10)

(1.11)

where f is a undetermined function of a and b. all r2

ij are as given in (1.4).

unlike in some 2d conformal eld theories, f (a, b) is not constrained in sym as far as

we know, since no other nontrivial symmetries extending conformal invariance have been

discovered by far. the scaling factor in (1.11) is singular whenever two points are separated

by a null geodesics. f (a, b) can be singular too in this case, since one of a and b vanishes

or becomes innity. unlike for the two and three point amplitudes, energy-momentum

conservation in general does not require two points being on the same light-cone. to see
the general consequence, we follow the same strategy as the above to replace r2
ij by their

on-shell value:

r2
12 = 1  e1  e2 = 2 sin2(12/2),
r2
34 = 2 sin2(34/2),
13 = 1 + e3  e4 = 2 sin2(13/2),
r2
23 = 2 sin2(23/2),
r2

14 = 2 sin2(14/2),
r2

24 = 2 sin2(24/2),
r2

(1.12)

5

where we assumed that particles 1 and 2 are incoming, and particles 3 and 4 are outgoing;

ij is the angle between momentum ki and momentum kj.

now use the energy conservation e1 + e2 = e3 + e4 and the momentum conservation

law e1e1 + e2e2 = e3e3 + e4e4, we derive

s = 4e1e2 sin2(12/2) = 4e3e4 sin2(34/2),

(1.13)

where s is one of the mandelstam variables. similarly

t = 4e1e3 sin2(13/2) = 4e2e4 sin2(24/2),
u = 4e1e4 sin2(14/2) = 4e2e3 sin2(23/2).

(1.14)

we see that those on-shell distances in (1.12) are simply related to the mandelstam
variables. however, r2
ij also depends on individual energies. it appears that the only way
to eliminate the dependence on energies is to use the two cross-ratios

now since mandelstam variables satisfy relation s + t + u = 0, we obtain

a =

s2
t2 ,

b =

s2
u2 .

1
a

+

b

= 1.

(1.15)

(1.16)

in other words, the above relation is a consequence and energy-momentum conservation.

our experience with the two and three point amplitudes tells us that in order for

the 4 point scattering amplitude to obey energy-momentum conservation, the four point

correlation function must be singular when (1.16) is satised. the correlation is also
singular whenever one of r2
ij = 0 has nothing to do
with energy-momentum conservation, the singularity of f (a, b) at 1/a + 1/b = 1 must
be severe than the singularity of the correlation at r2

ij vanishes. as already explained, r2

ij = 0.

the new singularity we observed above is not dictated by conformal invariance at all.

also, this singularity is demanded only in the large n limit, since for nite n there is no

momentum conservation in the anti-de sitter space. as we will explain in detail in the

next section, f (a, b) must be singular if

and (1.16) is only one of the four solutions

4ab = (ab  a  b)2,

to the above equation.

2. explicit calculations

we will see that an explicit calculation based on the ansatz of [2] is quite dicult.

we will be able to obtain a closed form for the two pint amplitude, we will not be able

to complete the calculation of the three point amplitude. however, we will show that

energy-momentum conservation is ensured in the large r limit. we discuss the calculation

of the four point amplitude. a lot of work is left for future.

first, we want to simplify the calculation of a general amplitude a bit. shifting
t  t  /2, for an incoming particle or an outgoing one, one can always ignore the
quadratic term in t in ansatz (1.1), if one remembers that the integral over t will always
pick up the most important contribution around t  0. to see this, consider the integral

z dte 

2 t2+itf (t, . . .),

(2.1)

where the dots denote other variables. f (t) is a periodic function of t of period 2. express

f (t, . . .) as

then

f (t, . . .) = z d f (, . . .)eit,

z dte 

2 t2+itf (t, . . .) = r 2

 z de ( )2



f (, . . .).

(2.2)

the integral over  centers around  with width   , compared with the principle

value , this deviation tends to zero in the large  limit. thus the above integral is

approximately

2 f (, . . .) = z dteitf (t, . . .).

compared with this approximate value, the deviation is about

so it can be ignored if



d f (, . . .)

d

,

f(, . . .)/ f (, . . .)  1/.

(2.3)

(2.4)

this condition is generally satised. alternatively, as we already saw, the function f (t, . . .)

has innitely many poles.
integral over t will pick up these poles, the gaussian factor
exp((/2)t2) helps to suppress all these poles except the one closest to zero. in this case,
the other factor exp(it) is more important than the gaussian factor, since it oscillates
fast around t  1/.

7

to demonstrate the above result, let us see how the energy conservation is derived in

the large  limit. for a general scattering amplitude, we have

aiitif (ti, . . .),

(2.5)

where ai = 1 for an outgoing state, and it is 1 for an incoming state. use a new set of
times: t1, ti = i + t1, i = 2, . . . , n. the function f (ti, . . .) is a function of i only, since the

correlation function in sym is invariant under a time translation. performing the integral

over t1 rst, we obtain the integrand for i

2 p i 2

i +ip aiiif (i, . . .),

(2.6)

where  = p i, and we omitted a term

i




(x aii)(x ii)

in the exponential. this is because the rst exponential together with the prefactor gives

rise to a delta function in the large r limit

2
r

(x aiei),

(2.7)

which is just the energy conservation law. this factor can be obtained without including

the gaussian factors. the remaining gaussian factor in (2.6) is positive denite in i, and

as we argued before, can be ignored so long if we pick up poles closest to zero in i.

the integral over variables on s3 is much more complicated, and since the gaussian
factor exp((i/2)|xi  ei|2) is the only nontrivial factor in the convolution, one has to
treat the convolution carefully. in the following, we will examine the two, three and four

amplitudes separately. before doing that, let us remark that this gaussian factor can be

replaced by

(2.13)

due to the delta function, the second integral in (2.14) is simplied. the integral over 2

can be separated into the radial part and the angular part, and the latter can be easily

and since for a large 1, the cos factor can be replaced by its average value 1/2, the value

for the integral in (2.16) involving the bessel function. substitute this into (2.16), we nd

(2)7
3r3 e14(e1e1  e2e2).

(2.19)

conservation of momentum for the two point amplitude also ensures conservation of

energy, so we have obtained the right delta function, as expected by our intuitive argument

in the last section. it remains to check whether the kinetic factor is also right. note that

the rst normalization factor in (2.19) depends on the overlap of the two wave functions

[2], so it can depend on the energy. the other normalization factor, n2, does not depend

on energy, although it can be a function of r and gs.

the wave function of [2] takes the form

f (t, x) = ei(tex) 

2 (x2

+(tex)2)

(2.20)

10

near the center of ads space. the gaussian factor can be ignored so long if the spacetime

region has a scale smaller than 1/. the proper scale is r/  r. so in the large

r limit the gaussian factor can be ignored and we have a plan wave. since the creation

operator is dened by

 = z dv tf (t, x) + . . . ,

so close to the center of the ads space we have, roughly

(t, x) = z d4k

e (cid:0)+(k)eiet+ikx + (k)eietkx(cid:1) ,

(2.21)

where all the coordinates are the proper ones, unlike the ones in (2.20). thus we expect

that the scattering amplitude, up to a numerical factor, must be

h1 e12 e2+i = r5e14(e1e1  e2e2),

(2.22)

where the volume factor r5 comes from the internal space s5, since the particles have

zero momenta in the internal space. the kinetic factor is precisely the same as in (2.19).
therefore, it appears that the normalization  is order 1, and n2  r8  n 2g2
s .

2.2. three point amplitude

consider the three point amplitude with two incoming particles. it is more convenient

to integrate out t3 rst, with t1 = 1 + t3, t2 = 2 + t3. as before a delta function ensuring
energy conservation results. the amplitude is

(2.27)

we do not know how to carry out the calculation of the above integral. one thing is

certain, though, that due to the singular behavior of the integrand, the integral is peaked

around 12 = 13 = 23 = 0. we thus expect that f3 will be a function of piki

only. we now argue that this ensures the momentum conservation in the large r limit.

introduce new vectors

l1 =

23 xiki,

l2 = p2/3k1 + 13k2
l3 = p1/(23)k1 +p2/(23)k2  1/2k3.

(2.28)

with the above relations, it is easy to see that p k2

i , using the fact 3 = 1 + 2.
now f3 is a function of l1 only. we can perform the integral in (2.23) over l2 and l3 rst.

i = p l2

(2.31)

where f4 is given by a similar formula as (2.24). we omitted a factor conserving energy.

to see whether the momentum conservation is true in the large r limit, as in the

previous subsection, we introduce a set of new vectors

li = xj

ijkj,

(2.32)

with {ij} being an orthogonal matrix. we can choose 1i = aipi/, where  = pi i.

if in the large r limit, f4(li) is less dependent on l1 than on other li, the integral over

l1 in (2.31) can be performed rst, thus resulting in a delta function associated with the

momentum conservation.

it can be shown that the condition that 1/a + 1/b = 1 is a singularity of f (a, b)
is a necessary one, where f (a, b) is a function introduced in (1.11). it is far from clear

whether it is also the sucient condition for conserving momentum.

finally, we want to show that if 1/a + 1/b = 1 is a singularity of f (a, b), then
both 1/a  1/b = 1 and 1/a  1b = 1 are also singularities of f (a, b). f (a, b) is

a symmetric function of a and b. to see this, we go to the euclidean space. exchange

point 1 with point 2, a and b are exchanged. exchange point 2 and point 3 we are led to
a  1/a, b  b/a, thus

f (1/a, b/a) = f (a, b) = f (b, a).

(2.33)

singular when this relation is satised. renaming the variables, we conclude that f (a, b) is

now, 1/a + 1/b = 1 is the same as a  pa/b = 1. this means that f (1/a, b/a) is
singular when 1/a  1/b = 1. exchanging a with b, we deduce that f (a, b) is singular
when 1/a  1/b = 1.

3. conclusion

we have only scratched the surface of the problem of investigating the consequence

of lorentz invariance for the holographic s-matrix and associated correlation functions in

the large n limit. for instance, more constraints can be derived from the requirement that

a4 is a function of only s and t, apart from a kinetic factor. even more interesting, is
the consequence of causality in the at space limit. we leave these problems for future

investigations.

our main result in this paper is the identication of a new singularity in the four

point amplitude, in the large n limit. this means that the dominant contribution to the

scattering amplitude comes from around this saddle point. this reminds us the problem

of sensitive initial conditions raised in [5]. it is observed there that if the two beams aimed

at the center of the ads are emitted from the boundary with a time dierence greater than

1/r, then the beams will miss each other. in the large n limit, this time dierence can

be arbitrarily small. it appears that a kind of sharp saddle point may help to understand

this puzzle. presumably this is a consequence of locality in the bulk space. it remains to

see whether bulk locality together boundary conformal invariance guarantee bulk poincare

invariance in the large n limit.
