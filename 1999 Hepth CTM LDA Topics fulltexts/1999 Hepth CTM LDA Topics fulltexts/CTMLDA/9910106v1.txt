abstract

the holographic ratio in pre-big bang string cosmology is obtained in the

presence string sources. an iterative procedure is adopted to solve the equa-

tions of motion and derive the ratio in four dimensional world. first the

zeroth order ratio is computed in the remote past, i.e. at t = , then the
holographic ratio is obtained taking into account the evolution of the back-

grounds following the iterative procedure. the corrections to the zeroth order

value of the ratio depends on the form of the initial number distribution of

the strings chosen. moreover, we estimate the holographic ratio in the recent

d ) and in the remote past (i.e. when  = 0),   p
past (i.e. when  =  1
 ,
in dierent dimensions in the einstein frame and in the string frame. we

nd that in the rst case it has similar time dependences in both the frames,

especially in four dimensions the ratio is explicitly computed to be the same

in the two cases, whereas for  = 0 case the time dependence is dierent.

i. introduction

recently, holographic principle [1] has attracted a lot of attention in the context of

black-hole physics, ads/cft correspondence [2] and cosmology.

it has been recognised

that theories with gravity are endowed with features dierent from those in the at space.

this could be realised from the fact that entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area

of its horizon according to bekenstein-hawking formula. the holography proposal states

that information for such theories reside on the boundary of the spatial volume with one bit

of information per unit planck area. thus, if s is the total entropy of the system enclosed

in volume v and a is the area of the boundary, the holographic bound is given by s

a  1
in suitable units. this bound is saturated for a black hole. indeed, for special class of black

holes, in the string theory framework, the entropy can be computed microscopically also,

hence the saturation of the holographic ratio for this class can be checked from an underlying

microscopic theory.

the principle of holography has been examined in the cosmological context by fischler

and susskind [3]. bekenstein has examined the consequences of the boundedness of s

a in

the cosmological scenario [4] almost a decade ago. he suggested that the boundedness of

the entropy could be utilised as a constraint to circumvent cosmological singularities. sub-

sequently, there has been considerable interest to study various properties of holography in

cosmological situation [59]. it is worthwhile to mention that there have been interesting

developments to bound the entropy and invoke thermodynamical considerations in the cos-

mological context. recently, a hubble entropy bound was envisaged [10,8] and cosmological

singularties from the string theory view point were analysed [11]. therefore the holography

principle and generalised second law of thermodynamics in cosmological scenario could be

used as additional constraints on cosmological models. thus, these features have stimu-

lated study of string cosmology from a new perspective. in another development, adopting

holography as an additional principle, a holographic covariant description of cosmology was

proposed and is being pursued actively [13].

the present investigation is a sequel to our previous eorts [7] to study consequences

of holography in the pre-big bang (pbb) cosmology. since string theory describes gravity

in a natural manner it is desired that the theory will be able to resolve issues pertaining

to physics of black-holes as well as the evolution of the universe.

in the pbb scenario

[14] ination is recognised to be due to stringy mechanism which has no analogue in the

einstein gravity.

it is well known that decelerating, expanding (frw) type solution in

t > 0 region can be related to an accelerating and expanding solution for negative t through

scale-factor duality(sfd) and time inversion. thus, the accelerating power law expansion is

driven by the kinetic energy term of the dilaton towards singularity whereas the decelerating,

expanding (frw) type solution for t > 0 has singularity in the past. this is the scenario in

the so called string frame metric. it is proposed that a cold, at, weakly coupled universe

proceeds towards a hot, curved and strongly coupled phase and then it goes through graceful

exit to the frw-like phase.

in the weak coupling approximation, the tree level string eective action, in cosmological

scenario, can be used to describe the evolution of scale-factor, dilaton and other matter elds.

however, as one approaches the high curvature, strong coupling regime, this approximation

is unlikely to hold. therefore, when one approaches t  0, it is necessary to account for
the higher order correction in  as well as higher genus correction.

there have been attempts to study cosmological evolution of graviton and dilaton in the

presence of classical stringy matter source by several authors. for an early account in the

context of pbb scenario we refer the reader to ref. [15]. in the string theory, this stringy

matter source is taken care of by a phenomenological source term in the string eective

action. the dynamical equation of such extended objects have interesting features in the

presence of time-dependent metric, especially if there is a horizon. when these objects are

well within the horizon, the ratio of pressure and the energy density denoted as  is zero

and the evolution equation is described by the motion of the center of mass of the string

and the oscillatory terms. on the other hand, if a string crosses the horizon its dynamical

degrees of freedom gets frozen, it increases in size linearly with time and triggers jeans like

instability [16]. then it is termed unstable string. when all the strings exceed the size of
the horizon in the (1 + d)-dimension,  becomes  1
the eect of such stringy sources on the holographic properties in the cosmological context.

d . here, in this paper we will be studying

we shall conne our attention on the pbb scenario, particularly in the pbb phase. we will

see that the eects of this stringy matter sources are felt reasonably only for negative time

far away from the singularity.

the organisation of the paper is as follows:

3 .  is zero in the far past (i.e. at t = ) and the second case occurs in the recent

in the section ii, we review in detail the isotropic, homogeneous solutions for  = 0 and
 =  1
past i.e. in the vicinity of tc (see fig.1).
then in the section iii, we discuss about the models of initial distribution of string sources,

consider the relevent iteration procedure to obtain background eld congurations from the

zeroth order solutions and derive the form of the the holographic ratio that we will be using

in the later sections. subsequently, we use this form to estimate the holographic ratio in the

zeroth order and discuss the features associated with nite value of the ratio.

in the next section iv, we compute the corrections to the holographic ratio for the power

law and exponential distributions and study their properties for the two cases.

in the section v, we estimate the holographic ratio when all the strings cross the horizon in

both the string and einstein frames in four dimensional world and explain in some detail

the known [20] procedure of going to the einstein frame.

in the following section vi, we deal with the holographic ratios in the general d-dimension

in both the remote and recent past in the string as well as in the einstein frames.

we end with a discussion in the section vi.

ii. isotropic and homogeneous solutions in the string frame

the low energy eective action in the four dimension in the string frame is given by [17]

 is the dilaton. the string coupling constant, gs, is dened by the relation gs = e



2 . the

last term in eqn.(2.1) is due to the string source and its eects are treated classically. the

string source part of the action is

we work in isotropic and homogeneous space, therefore the line element in the string

the energy and pressure are dened as follows

density per unit comoving volume to be small [19,21]. so it does not aect the initial

curvature of the universe. we note that the solutions(2.23)-(2.25) go over to the dilaton

driven vaccuum solution in the t  0 limit. moreover, we will see that this solution acts
as good string perturbative vaccuum. in other words, corrections to zeroth order solutions

is rather small. this observation is valid, at least, for very large negative t. let us proceed

to discuss about the corrections in the presence of classical string sources. the length of a

string will vary, in principle, from ls to . at the time t = , horizon is of innite extent.
all the strings are within the horizon. as time progresses, the horizon shrinks. so strings

also start crossing the horizon, making pressure negative and  non-zero. this non-zero 

will introduce corrections on the top of the zeroth order solution. moreover,  will be small

at the beginning.

untill now we have been discussing solutions in one limit. now let us consider the

background eld congurations in another limit, namely when all the strings are outside the
horizon and  is  1
mean length of the strings is of the order of ls. if the mean length of strings is more, tc

6h 2 has the following

expression,

(x) = |(x  x+)(x  x)|

(x  3x)2

(2.27)

so at x = x or, t  ls, (x) goes to zero. then the string sources become unimportant
compared to curvature. the tree level string eective action is not reliable in this regime.

|x| >> x, then |t| >> ls. let us denote the
hence we consider the large |x| limit i.e.
corresponding x  time and the ordinary time by xcl and tcl, where the tree level action is
reliable. but at t = tcl,  need not coincide with  1
3 if tcl = tc. this situation is
represented by an arrow in the fig.1.

3 .  =  1

now let us assume that the mean length of our string sources is of the order of |tcl|. let us
also assume that the source energy density to be a reasonable fraction of curvature at that

time. the corresponding eld congurations around xcl are [19,20]

(2.32)

so far we have considered solutions in two cases: (i) = 0 and (ii) =  1
to examine the background eld congurations when  varies between these two extrema.

3 . it is important

this will be dealt with in the following sections.

iii. classical string sources, iteration and holographic

ratio

in this section we look for a simultaneous solution of the background equations of motion

and equations of motion for the string sources as  decreases from zero to  1
3 with time
proceeding from  to tcl. the nature of the evolution equations are such that we cannot
get an analytic exact solution for 0 >  >  1
3. therefore we start from the  = 0 end.
there we have the exact solution for the background elds. if we put back this solution

in the sigma model action to evaluate , we recover the value  = 0 [16], only in the

limiting case t   which is same as a  a0.
not simultaneous solution of background as well as string equations of motions for time not

in other words, our exact solution is

exactly . moreover, we cannot dispense with the position coordinates in the expression
for pressure and energy density. to get a simple expression for  as a function of time

we assume, following gasperini etal [21], that the source term represents an ensemble of

classical strings. initially all the strings are within the horizon, hence pressure and  are

zero. the two types of initial distribution of the lengths of the strings, we consider, will give

dierent expressions for . here, rst we review the basic elements of the model, then derive

the expression for  from the model to be used in the iteration procedure, to obtain the

background elds. then we utilize these solutions to evaluate the corresponding holographic

ratios and subsequently compare and contrast the features of the two types of distributions.

now let us briey recapitulate some of the essential features of the model. for further

details we refer the interested reader to the ref. [21]. we consider an ensemble of large

number, say n, of classical strings. moreover, let the length of i-th string at an instant of

time t be li(t), and number density of strings of length l at that instant be n(l, t). then

n = r ls n(l, t)dl. here, the dierential equations satised by li(t) and n(l, t) are,

li(t) = h(t)li(t)(li(t)  d(t))
aan + l [n(l, a)l(l  d)] = 0

(3.1)

where, d = h1 is the hubble length and h is the hubble parameter. the energy density

of stable and unstable strings (i.e. length less or greater than the horizon) are given by

es = z d3xgs =
eu = z d3xgu =

1

 z ln(l, a)(d  l)dl
 z ln(l, a)(l  d)dl

1

(3.2)

(3.3)

note that in the far past when all the strings lie within the horizon,  = 0 and eu = 0. on
the otherhand,  =  1
by

3 corresponds to the situation es = 0. so,  could be approximated

(t) = 

1
3

eu

eu + es

from the denition(3.3) it follows that eu = eu satises a dierential equation

d eu 

1
d

ln a
ln d

eu = dn(d)

(3.4)

(3.5)

where, n(d) = n(d, t = ) expresses the number density of strings of size of the
horizon at time t according to the distribution of number density at the far past. note that

this is the dierential equation for evaluating eu at any time and we will be using it again

and again. on the contrary, once we assume the form of the distribution of number density

at the remote past, es can be directly evaluated from the denition(3.2). so let us discuss

the two types of distributions,

n(l) = 2l3,
n(l) =

n
l0

exp(

l
l0

)

(3.6)

(3.7)

where,  and n are related to the total number of strings. the mean length of a string in

the two cases are respectively 2ls and ls + l0.

now for the rst type of number distribution  goes to  1

3 as tc is of the order ls whereas

for the second type tc can vary. let us see how this happens a la gasperini etal [21]. first
we note that when  becomes  1
3 or, almost all strings cross the horizon, a(t)  (t)
[19],  being some negative fraction. then we nd

3 only when d  ls.

so,  tends to  1
let us now consider the exponential distribution. the dierential equation for eu near

3 yields,

eu = nl0(

es = nl0[(1 +

whereas,

and as a result,

ls as well as tcl (i.e. l0 > ls and l0 > tcl) then  becomes  1
3 at the time tcl for a particular
value of l0, say 2fm3
3 when tc  ls. we
note here that for the exponential distribution of mean length ls,  falls o faster than that

tcl. on the contrary, if l0  ls then  becomes  1

of power law.

again as we are considering the situation almost in the far past i.e. near t   where

the horizon is very large, almost all strings of any size are within the horizon. it should not

matter much whether we take strings of mean length ls or, larger and we take power law

distribution of number of strings or, exponential distribution. we will see how far this is

true in the following. before we move on to estimate the holographic ratio, let us describe

the way we calculate the background elds, the prescriptions for the iterations and how we

put the holographic ratio in proper form to compute it at each stage of iteration.

in order to obtain the background eld congurations order by order through iteration,

it is suitable to use a varaible y = ln a
a0

, instead of x, along the line of ref. [21]. in terms of

the variable y , eqn.s (2.13)-(2.15) are rewritten as

where, w(y ) is an auxiliary function introduced through the relation

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

our main aim will be to solve the w equation using the expression for . note that putting

w =

we use the expression(3.16) for w to nd the rst order corrected . moreover, for noncon-

stant ,  is given by,

(3.17)

let us now explain the procedure for iteration as we carry it out for power law distri-

bution. in that case, putting the zeroth order expression for w we get  which involves the

parameter . once we put the rst order corrected  in the dierential equation we obtain

w corrected to order . this procedure is repeated to get higher order corrections in w. for
exponential distribution procedure is similar. due to the presence of exp( 1
no analog of the parameter ; though at the rst sight it might appear that 1

f y 2 ), there is

f or, f can be

used as expansion parameter depending on whether f is greater or less than one. there,

improvement on the zeroth order result through iteration is relevent in the powers of y only.

whatever be the distribution, at each stage we utilize the w to evalute the holographic ratio.

to achieve that we write the holographic ratio in a proper form. moreover, let us keep in

mind that we are considering the hubble horizon throughout ( we mention in passing that

in the remote past the event horizon goes as square root of the hubble horizon and for small

time both converge). now in the string frame, p lancklength, lp(t), is time-dependent and

is given by [24]

lp(t) =

let us estimate the holographic ratio in the zeroth order. this comes out as

(3.20)

now  and t are constants. hence the holographic ratio also, in the zeroth order, is constant,

for all time. so entropy per unit planck area of the horizon is also constant. it is given by

the above expression. this result is valid when the horizon is nite. now the same solution

describes the universe in the early phase i.e. when t   or, a  a0; the horizon tends
to innite then. hence we infer, as a limiting procedure, that the entropy per unit planck

area of the horizon is given by the expression(3.20) when the universe is at. since the area

is tending to innity, entropy within the hubble horizon also must be very large. as the

universe is cold at the begining, it may appear contradictory. but the energy density per

unit comoving voulme is also constant. hence entropy per comoving volume is constant. as

the number of comoving volumes within the horizon tends to innity, entropy within the

hubble horizon also tends to innity.

this ratio has good physical implication. if this zeroth order ratio is one (as is taken in

time t in the paper [8]), or, at least bounded from above, then t = f inite number.
again in the pbb cosmology (i) t which is the duration of dilaton driven phase is very large,

(ii) , the temperature at the begining of the universe, is very low. hence product, t is also

a nite number. so two independent considerations lead to the same conclusion. recently

veneziano has shown [8] that the ratio assumed of the order one, explains the entropy

budget of the universe from the pbb cosmology quite accurately upto some numerical

factors. therefore it is quite reasonable to assume that the ratio is of the order one. in

other words, the universe in the at beginning seems to show holography as in ads spaces

[22].

iv. holographic ratio near the remote past

after discussing the features associated with the zeroth order holographic ratio being

bounded let us see how the ratio changes with time as the universe evolves from the remote

past. the evolution will depend on the number distribution of strings at the remote past. as

a result the holographic ratio will also be getting modied dierentially. now the holographic

ratio l2
p

s

a is roughly e d

g . as the universe evolves the rst factor increases whereas the

second factor decreases. hence the holographic ratio will increase or decrease depending

on whether the relative increament of the rst factor is more or less compared to relative

decreament of the second factor. we will see in our study below that in the case of power

law distribution the scale factor dominates whereas in the case of exponential distribution it

is the coupling constant which initially dominates, though very weakly, for a short interval

of time before being overtaken by the scale factor.

a. power law distribution

let us now rst consider the power law distribution, n(l) = 2l3 [21]. then

equation(3.5) becomes

y eu  eu = 2y d1

and on integration we get,

eu

2 = h + ey z y

0

hey

on the otherhand, if we directly evaluate eqn.(3.2) we arrive at,

es
2 =

1
s  h
l2

hence, in this distribution, the expression for  takes the following form,

where, h is the hubble parameter of the universe given by

 =

h + ey r y

h =

now from eqn.s(3.12)-(3.15) we get

w =

and then substituting eqn.(4.6) in eqn.(4.4), we get  to order  as,

 =

[cosh3y  ey +

sinh3y ] + o()2

(4.8)

here, integration of the r.h.s. of the expression (3.17) for  is not possible if we keep terms

upto all orders in y . so to start with, in the rst step of iteration, we keep terms upto y 2,

for the sake of simplicity and we get,

 = 0[1 


2

y + o(y )3o()2]

(4.9)

where,  = ls3t . now, in the remote past y is small. so whether t is large or small,
correction term in the above expression is small compared to one. zeroth order solution acts

as good perturbative vaccuum near the remote past. moreover, if t is large, zeroth order

solution acts as good perturbative vaccuum for all y .

to carry on iteration, let us assume the  obtained in eqn.(4.9) to hold good for all

orders in y . we put this  in the background equation to get w with o() correction,

w =

we can use this result to get  and  for third order or, upto 3 and higher order in y . in

(4.17)

we observe that coecient of  in the above equation(4.17) is of opposite sign compared

to that of rst order eqn.(4.16). this sign dierence arises due to the following reason. in

obtaining the expression(4.9) for  we have kept terms, upto y 2. but while calculating w,

eqn.(4.10), we have kept terms upto all orders in y . then we have used this expression

(4.10) for w in the holographic formula. it gives rise to the apparent discrepency.

if we

had strictly kept terms upto y 2, coecient of  would have been absent in the rst order

holographic ratio. again in the second order formula(4.17) there is no term in the coecient

of  upto y 2. hence the second order result is consistent with the rst order one. moreover,

if we had kept terms in the expression for w upto y 5, strictly, the holographic ratio with 2

correction would have contained terms upto y 3. now in the expression for the holographic

ratio(4.17), coecient of  decreases and that of 2 increases with y , if terms upto y 3 are

considered. this feature will be manifest from the plots below. again as a next step, if we

go on to consider the third order in , to start with we have to keep terms higher order than

y 5 in the expression for . and this will not change the coecients of terms upto y 5 in

the expression for w and the coecients of terms upto y 3 in the expression for holographic

ratio. hence, we conclude, that as the universe evolves form t = , the holographic ratio
decreases, at least upto the time terms from y 6 onwards are negligible.

the plots of the coecients of  and 2 in the holographic ratio, for small values of y , are

shown in fig. 2 and 3 respectively.

we observe from the plots that the coecient of  decreases whereas the coecient of 2

holographic ratio decreases as stated in the previous paragraph.

b. exponential distribution

after discussing all about the power law distribution, let us go over to the second case,

namely exponential one. the dierential equation satised by eu for the exponential distri-

bution takes the form,

y eu  eu = ny d

d
l0

exp(

d

)

which on integration gives,

eu = nl0[

we note that the holographic ratio, in this case, deviates slightly upward from the zeroth

order result. let us check that this deviation is not spurious. for this purpose we plot the

correction to holographic ratio for w upto y 2 order also. we get an identical looking curve.

we recall that we have kept terms upto y 2 in the expression for h. this means that the

region of y taken in the plot is the region where higher order terms are negligible compared

to y 2. hence this little upward deviation from the zeroth order result will remain if we

go to higher order in y . actually this little upward deviation is generic of exponential

distribution. again, to come to this conclusion, we plot the ratio for f = 1. this is shown

in the gure 5:

fig. 5. the plot of correction to holographic ratio l2

s
a denoted as r against y for exponential

distribution with l0 = f t anf f = 1.

we see that the domain of the initial plataue or, rectangular shaped region in the above

gure, f ig.5, shifts with respect to the previous plot, f ig.4, to slightly larger value of y .

hence we infer that if we go on decreasing f to  this nature of the curve will remain, only

the domain of the curve will shift to larger value of y . this plataue occurs due to rst order

correction. so the initial rise will remain if we include the higher order corrections also.

note the magnitude of smallness in the initial rise in the holographic ratio. we mention in
passing that for  =  1
but less than one, as tcl < t .

t has to be much greater than ls

t = tcl

t

uptill now we were concentrating on how the holographic ratio evolves over small time

interval near the remote past. in this regime, only few strings cross the horizon. perturbative

techniques are useful also. but we dont have an easy way to study the holographic behaviour

when, arbitrary number of strings say, half of the total number of strings are more than the

size of the horizon. obvious possibility is to go to the other extreme i.e. when all the strings

became nondynamical. this is what we are going to do in the next section.

comparison with the einstein frame ratio

let us study another feature of the holographic ratio. this is whether the holographic

ratio is the same in both the string and einstein frames. in the pbb cosmology, qualitative

features of the universe like blue shift, shrinking of the horizon etc. [20] are same in both the

frames. so the question whether similarly the holographic ratio is equal in the two frames

motivates us to study the corresponding ratio in the einstein frame. the metrics in the

einstein frame and the string frame are related by the following conformal transformation

after this short preliminary about the conversion of string frame to einstein frame in (1+3)-

in the string frame. we note that in the einstein frame [19],

dilaton also contributes to the energy density and the pressure. consequently, the net

uptill now we have been in (1 + 3)-dimension, came across nice features like constancy

of holographic ratio in the remote past, identical ratio in the string and einstein frames in

the recent past,i.e. |t| = tcl = tc. let us now move on to diverse dimensions looking for the
similar interesting features.

vi. holographic ratio in diverse dimension

here we write down the string eective action in (1 + d)-dimension and the equations of

motions derived from it. the eective action in (1 + d)-dimension is

h1ss =

z dd+1xge(r + ) + s

the resulting equations of motions [15] are

first let us keep in mind that we are writing d = m + n, where, (i) m is the number of

expanding spatial dimensions and (ii) n is the number of contracting spatial dimensions in

the string frame. scale factor of a contracting dimension will be denoted as acon and it

will be just reciprocal of aex. this is the only posssibility compatible with non-zero energy

density [15]. here, now onwards we will be conning ourselves to consider mainly time

dependences of quantities. moreover we will look into the following aspects, (i) whether the

holographic ratio is constant or, not in dierent dimensions in the remote past, (ii) whether

the holographic ratios in the remote past are the same in both the string and the einstein

frames in (1+3) as well as in the diverse dimensions and (iii) how the time dependences of the

holographic ratios in the recent past, in the string frame, go together with the corresponding

ones in the einstein frames in various dimensions.

a. remote past

let us now start with the case when we have nine isotropically expanding dimensions.

then we have [21] after solving the above set(6.2) of equations as in the (1 + 3)-dimensional

case with p = q = 0,

and we know [25] in the ten dimension, p lancklength, is given by,

(l10

p )2 = g

so, the holographic ratio is given by,

(6.5)

where, k is a numerical factor coming through vh

kh and 9e is the temperature in the

remote past.

next let us consider the case when three dimensions are expanding and six other dimen-

sions are contracting. then, observing that equations of motions in terms of sfd invariant

variables remain same as in the previous case, we get

and (l10

p )2 is written as in the nine expanding case. so, the holographic ratio

again, the ratio of the hubble volume to hubble area is given by

sions. consequently,

p )8 s

(6.9)

therefore, we see, in both the cases as t tends to , the holographic ratio becomes
constant as in the (1 + 3)-dimension. let us examine whether this happens in any arbitrary

dimensions.

we note that for (1 + d)-dimensional world,

aex = a0ex(1 
16l2e0
 =
e
|t(t  2t )|
e0

(6.10)

and as far as time dependence is concerned, in the large |t| limit (i.e. |t| >> t ) we have

ld1

(t)

e

|h|

s
a 

vh

(6.11)

again, in the (1 + d)-dimension, the einstein frame scale factor and time are related to

the string frame ones [20] as

ae(te) = e 

d1 a(t)

|te| = |t|

d+1
d1

(6.12)

thus the scale factor in the einstein frame is, in the large |t| limit, in terms of the string
frame time is expressed as

ae(te) = |t|

2

d1

(6.13)

note that in this limit the universe is isotropic even if in the string frame it is mixed

isotropic. in (1 + 3)-dimension, in particular, the equation of state is

p =

1
3



(6.14)

then we arrive at the following holographic ratio in the einstein frame, in the (1 + d)-

dimension

ld1

p

(6.15)

where, |te| corresponds to the time in the einstein frame. so the time dependences of the
holographic ratios in the two frames in this large |t| limit do not match in any dimension.
but we have seen that in the recent past the ratio is same in both the frames in the four

dimension. therefore, let us check, in the recent past, whether in arbitrary dimensions time

dependences of the holographic ratio match in both the frame.

b. recent past

now in the (1+d)-dimensional spacetime near the time tcl,  =  1

d and the relevent eld

congurations, namely the scale factor of the expanding dimension and the sfd invariant

dilaton [20] are

a(t) = |t| 2

1+d

 = dln|a(t)|

as a result the holographic ratio in the string frame becomes

ld1
p

s
a  |t|

1d
1+d

but now the einstein frame time te is related to the string frame time by

|te|  |t|1+ 4m

d21

(6.16)

(6.17)

(6.18)

and the scale factors in the einstein frame, corresponding to the expanding and contracting

dimensions in the string frame, are

aem(te)  |te|2 m+1n
aen(te)  |te|2 2m1+d

d2+4m1  |t|2 nm1
d2+4m1  |t|2 d1+2m

d21

d21

(6.19)

consequently, the corresponding ratio in the einstein frame in terms of the string time is

given by

ld1

p

s
a  |t|

1d
1+d

(6.20)

hence in the recent past the holographic ratios in the two frames have the same time

dependences in all dimensions. we note here that time dependences of holographic ratio as

in eqn.(6) was arrived at [6] from dierent consideration.

vii. discussion

in this paper, we have set out to compute the holographic ratio. first, we obtained

the holographic ratio in the zeroth order and discussed the implication of the ratio to be

bounded. then for the power law distribution, we obtained the correction to the ratio in the

rst and second order in  following an iteration procedure. we found that the correction

depletes the ratio, albeit by small amount. for the exponential distribution, the correction

increases the value of the ratio by very small amount (10308), towards the beginning of

evolution, over a small range of time. this is due to the domination of coupling constant

over scale factor during that period. again, we computed the ratio in the other extreme,

when all the strings crossed the horizon, assuming the mean length of the classical strings

is much larger than ls. we then showed that the holographic ratio, has the same time

dependences in both the string and einstein frames in this limit, and taking care of all

the factors in one particular case, namely in the four dimension we found that the ratio is

identical. this gives another evidence that qualitatively the two frames are equivalent in the

pbb cosmology and hubble horizon is a good choice in both the frames. on the other hand,

in the remote past the ratio in the string frame is constant in all dimensions. however, in

the einstein frame, it goes as inverse of the string time. the ratio is dierent in the two

frames. we have checked that solutions obtained by conformal trasformation do satisfy the

equations of motions in the einstein frame in this limit when coupling constant goes to

zero. we may mention that if one follows the proposal of ref [6], then also one gets the

corresponding holographic ratio which is inversely proportional to the string time. thus we

nd that the holographic ratio in the remote past is not on similar footing as other physical

quantities. we have studied the holographic behaviour in the presence of string sources

almost in two extreme cases in (1 + 3)-dimensions. it is possible to generalise the exercise

of getting the correction by iterative procedure to (1 + d)-dimension. again, we applied

pertubative method to go away from the extremality ( = 0). it will be very interesting

to study the holographic ratio explicitly in the intermediate region. it is also desirable to

see how the zeroth order holographic ratio gets modied in presence of higher dimensional

branes. moreover it is very much of relevence to ask about the mechanism of holography in

this case.
