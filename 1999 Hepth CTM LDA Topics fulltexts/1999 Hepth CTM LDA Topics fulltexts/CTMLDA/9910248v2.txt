abstract

we introduce a method of using the a dual type iia string to compute -corrections
to the moduli space of heterotic string compactications. in particular we study the
hypermultiplet moduli space of a heterotic string on a k3 surface. one application of
this machinery shows that type iib strings compactied on a calabiyau space suer
from worldsheet instantons, spacetime instantons and, in addition, mixed instantons
which in a sense are both worldsheet and spacetime. as another application we look
at the hyperkahler limit of the moduli space in which the k3 surface becomes an ale
space. this is a variant of the geometric engineering method used for vector multiplet
moduli space and should be applicable to a wide range of examples. in particular we
reproduce sen and wittens result for the heterotic string on an a1 singularity and a
trivial bundle and generalize this to a collection of e8 point-like instantons on an ale
space.

introduction

at the present time theories with eight supercharges (such as n = 2 in four dimensions)
represent the goldilocks theories for analyzing moduli spaces of superstring compacti-
cations. with more supersymmetry the moduli space is a symmetric space and in many
respects is too rigid to be particularly interesting. with less supersymmetry quantum eects
lift some of the classical moduli and computing these is in general not possible with current
techniques.

for n = 2 theories in four dimensions, the moduli space factorizes locally into a product
mv  mh, where mv is the special kahler moduli space coming from scalar elds in vector
multiplets and mh is the hypermultiplet moduli space which is quaternionic kahler. the
space mv has been studied at great length and can be considered to be fairly well understood.
the same is not true for mh.

an important obstacle in the study of mh can be understood as follows. if we wanted
to construct a model producing n = 2 supersymmetry (complete with gravity) in four
dimensions we might try to do it in one of many ways. for example:

1. compactify the type iia string on a calabiyau threefold x.

2. compactify the type iib string on a calabiyau threefold y .

3. compactify the heterotic string on sh  eh , where sh is a k3 surface and eh is a

2-torus.

in each of these pictures some aspects of the moduli space are exact, in the sense that a
computation at string and -model tree level is not corrected by quantum corrections, and
some aspects are prone to -corrections, i.e., quantum corrections for the nonlinear -model;
or -corrections, i.e., quantum corrections from the eective spacetime quantum eld theory
(where  represents the string coupling). we list these eects in table 1.

what is important to note is that the type iib string on y gives an exact model for
the moduli space mv whereas none of these pictures gives an exact model for mh. indeed
we do not know any way to get an exact picture of mh. if we could map out mh then
this would be the rst time in our study of string theories that we were able to probe truly
nonperturbative eects both with respect to  and . it could well be therefore that a better
understanding of mh would lead to a better understanding of the fundamental nature of
string theory in general.

what we can see about table 1 is that the compactications listed above tend to shine
light on each others ignorance about mh. in particular one could try to use the type iia
string to understand the -corrections in the heterotic string compactication.

the general problem of completely analyzing mh complete with all its quantum correc-
tions is technically very dicult at present although there appears to be nothing lacking in
our knowledge in principle. in this paper we will attempt a rather modest goal. for the

latter part we will conne ourselves to the hyperkahler limit of the moduli space where most
of the interesting string corrections disappear. we will rederive a result already computed
in two dierent ways by sen [1] and by witten [2] and then try to generalize this result. we
show that the moduli space of heterotic strings on a blown-up a1 singularity, with a trivial
bundle near this singularity, is locally described by a hyperkahler limiting manifold of real
dimension 4 given by an atiyahhitchin monopole moduli space. equivalently the moduli
space is the same as that of a pure n = 4 su(2) yangmills theory in three dimensions [3].
we would like to claim that our approach to this problem is useful in many ways. firstly
it is an example of using duality to the type iia string to obtain nontrivial results about -
corrections to the heterotic string. secondly, it provides a natural link between the heterotic
strings on an ade singularity and the moduli space of corresponding n = 4 yangmills
theories in three dimensions.

on a third point our method shows that taking the rigid limit in which we move from
quaternionic kahler geometry to hyperkahler geometry is mirror to taking the rigid limit of
special kahler geometry in vector multiplet moduli space to obtain seibergwitten theory.
thus the geometric engineering methods of [4,5] of analyzing seibergwitten theories can
be modied using mirror symmetry to geometrically engineer statements about the the
hyperkahler moduli space of hypermultiplets in a corresponding limit. this idea of using
mirror symmetry together with geometric engineering to obtain a hypermultiplet moduli
space plays a role in various contructions that have appeared in the past [69].
in the
context of using it to describe vector bundles in the heterotic string it also appears to be
closely related to the construction presented in [10].

one should be able to generalize the computation in this paper to many statements about
the heterotic string with various bundles on ale spaces. as an example we engineer the
problem of one or two free point-like e8 instanton coalescing with an a1 singularity. this
generalizes to give a natural proposal:

proposition 1 the moduli space of a heterotic string on an ale space of type an1 with k
point-like e8 instantons is same as the moduli space of an n = 4 gauge theory in three dimen-
sions with gauge group su(n)  u(1)k and k matter hypermultiplets each in the fundamental
representation of su(n) and charged with respect to one of the u(1)s.1

1to be pedantic this group should probably be written su(n)  u(1)k  h, where h is a discrete group

2

in principle our method can be used to extend this result to any kind of bundles, including
smooth bundles, point-like spin(32)/z2 instantons or fractional point-like instantons as in
[11].

it should be emphasized however that this paper should be considered to be the rst step
in addressing the more interesting question of the full quaternionic kahler moduli space. in
a sense by going to the hyperkahler limit we are avoiding the truly stringy nature of the
subject and conning ourselves to statements about quantum eld theory.

in order to simplify the exposition, this paper will be oriented towards studying a partic-
ular example although we will be able to make general statements based on our analysis. it
would be nice to study an example where the dimension of mh is fairly small. this in itself
is not particularly easy since simple compactications of the heterotic string on sh  eh
tend to produce rather enormous mhs as seen in [12] for example. our example will have
a moduli space of only 4 quaternionic dimensions.

the general principle of the manipulations in this papers are as follows. first we nd a
calabiyau threefold x which has a stable degeneration such that the iia string on x is, at
this point, dual to a weakly coupled, large radius limit of the heterotic string conguration
we desire. if y is the mirror of x we will nd that, at least in the class of examples we
consider, y is a k3 bration with a p1 base. as we move to the stable degeneration of x,
the base of y becomes innitely large. as such the stable degeneration of x is mirror to to
the way that seibergwitten theories were geometrically engineered in [4] from the type
iia string compactied on y . we will engineer hyperkahler moduli spaces as rigid limits of
the quaternionic kahler manifold mh rather than the original process of engineering rigid
special kahler moduli spaces as rigid limits of the special kahler manifold mv .

we introduce the example in section 2 and we compute the stable degeneration required
to understand the duality to the heterotic string. we map out the moduli space of this
degeneration in section 3.

in section 4 we discuss what happens if we try to move away from the stable degeneration
back into the bulk of the moduli space. the central point of this section is that the k3 surface
sh of interest is an elliptic bration with an innitely large section and a bre of zero area.
its volume is nite however and the generic areas of the transcendental 2-spheres are also
nite and nonzero.

the picture obtained in section 4 will allow us to make some brief comments about
mixed instantons in section 5. we argue that there are instanton corrections beyond what
one would navely consider necessary in superstring compactications.

in section 6 we then discuss another application of section 4. essentially this is analysis
of the rst-order eects as we move back into the bulk of the moduli space. this studies a
hyperkahler limit of the general quaternionic kahler moduli space. in particular this allows
us to recover sen and wittens result. it is then a simple matter to introduce point-like e8

containing as a subgroup the symmetric group on k elements. we will ignore such discrete factors here.

instantons into the picture and derive proposition 1. we then show how this proposition is
linked to intriligatorseiberg mirror symmetry in three dimensions.

while we were putting the nal touches to this manuscript, [13] appeared which derives

proposition 1 by using m-theory arguments.

2 an example

let us begin with the heterotic/type iia pair introduced in [12] and later claried in [14].
we consider y to be the hypersurface

x2
0 + x3

1 + x12

2 + x24

3 + x24

4 = 0

(1)

in the weighted projective space p4
{12,8,2,1,1}. the type iia string on y is then believed to
be dual to an e8  e8 heterotic string compactied on sh  eh where the gauge bundle is
trivial over eh while over sh we have two e8 bundles with c2 = 10 and c2 = 14 respectively.
the moduli space mh is then constructed in the heterotic language from deformations
of sh together with its bundle. a k3 surface has 20 quaternionic deformations and an e8
bundle has 30c2 248 quaternionic deformations. thus the quaternionic dimension of mh in
this case would be 244. alternatively from the type iia side mh comes from deformations
of complex structure of y , variations of the ramond-ramond elds in h 3(y, u(1)) and the
dilaton-axion. this gives h2,1(y ) + 1 = 244 quaternionic dimensions again.

clearly it would be a very unwieldy to study an example with this many deformations!
in order to cut down to number of hypermultiplets we need to tighten our constraints on
the e8 bundles and tighten our constraints on the k3 surface sh itself.

note that this example has h1,1(y ) = 3. we would be much better o if we took the
mirror of y , which we call x, and considered the type iia string on x. now we would have
only 4 hypermultiplets. the mirror pair x and y have been studied extensively [15, 16].
the discussion in [17] is also useful for our purposes.

as well as the usual greeneplesser orbifold [18] construction we may also write x in
{12,8,2,1,1} given by the

the form of a singular version of y . let x be the hypersurface in p4
dening equation

we implicitly assume that x is blown up to render it smooth. this exhibits an extremal
transition from y to x. we now have 3 deformations of complex structure which may be

now the stable degeneration method of [19, 20] may be used to recover exactly which
e8  e8 heterotic string this type iia compactication represents. in particular we need to
nd a form of x as a k3 bration and then nd a degeneration which takes each k3 bre to
a union of two rational elliptic surfaces intersecting along an elliptic curve. it is this process
which gives a picture of a weakly-coupled heterotic string compactied on a large k3 surface
allowing us to make an unambiguous identication of the heterotic string compactication.

5

this process is not particularly direct. we depict the manipulations involved in gure 1.
the pictures are those typical in f-theory. they show the calabiyau threefold in the form
of an elliptic bration where the plane of the paper represents the base and the lines represent
the discriminant locus labelled by the corresponding kodaira bre. for more information
we refer to [21].

the process is as follows:

1. we begin with x. this has four lines of ii bres as shown in the upper-left gure.
= p1  p1.
the base is the hirzebruch surface f2. we wish to change the base to f0
this may be done as explained in [14] by blowing up and down curves in the base.
in particular we blow up the two top corners of the square in the top-left gure and
then blow down the lines corresponding to the left and right sides of the square. this
yields the top-right gure. note that this birational transformation does not change
the moduli space of complex structures of x.

2. now we begin to deform the complex structure by taking y  0. the interesting parts
of the discriminant move towards the vertical sides of the square. if we restrict the
elliptic bration to a horizontal line f we obtain an elliptic k3 surface with two ii
bres and four i1 bres. as we take y  0 the i1s move pairwise into the ii bres.
this is exactly the stable degeneration required as seen in [19].

3. when y = 0 we obtain very serious singularities along the vertical sides of the square.
we may improve matters by blowing up up these sides to produce two new components
of the base. furthermore the original component of the base may be blown down
without loss of information. we end up with a base with two components as expected
for the stable degeneration picture. the components intersect along a rational curve
c. restricting the elliptic bration to c gives a k3 surface s. this surface s is then
isomorphic to the k3 surface sh on which the e8  e8 heterotic string is compactied.

the standard f-theory rules then tell us that sh is a k3 surface with two e8 quotient
singularities (as two ii bres pass through c). furthermore, the rules in [20] tell us that
all 24 instantons are point-like and 10 of them sit at one of the singularities and 14 sit at
the other singularity.

this shows explicitly why we have only 4 hypermultiplets. 16 of the 20 deformations of
the k3 surface have been xed by demanding two e8 singularities. all deformations of the
bundle have been xed by stating that the instantons are point-like and that their locations
are xed. we assume that x has been blown up, i.e., the corresponding vector or tensor
moduli have been switched on to move us into the coulomb phase thus freezing all other
hypermultiplet moduli.

it is perhaps worth noting that this stable degeneration and resulting heterotic interpre-
tation of x is not standard. in the usual f-theory language of morrison and vafa [14,22] the
k3 bration of x is given by restricting the elliptic bration to vertical lines in gure 1. we

6

have restricted the elliptic bration to horizontal lines f . our approach is therefore related
to the conventional picture by heterotic-heterotic duality as discussed in [2224] where the
vertical and horizontal directions are exchanged. this appears to be an essential step if we
want the stable degeneration of x to correspond to the mirror of giving the base p1 of y a
very large area.

3 mapping out the completely classical limit

to recap, we are going to study an example where the number of quaternionic moduli for
mh is equal to four. this has three interpretations:

1. a type iia string (or f-theory) compactied on x. x has three deformations of
complex structure as given by (2). the other moduli giving mh are 8 real r-r moduli
and the dilaton-axion.

2. a type iib string on y , the mirror of x. y has three deformations of kahler form
given by the size of the original p4
{12,8,2,1,1} together with two blow-ups required to
smooth y . the other moduli giving mh are 8 real r-r moduli and the dilaton-axion.

3. a heterotic string on a k3 surface sh (times a 2-torus). sh has two e8 singularities
leaving only 4 quaternionic deformations of the ricci-at metric and b-eld. the bun-
dle is completely rigid and corresponds to point-like instantons buried in the singular
points of sh.

now none of these three pictures gives an exact model for the entire moduli space. the
type iia picture will give an exact picture if we x the dilaton so that the string coupling is
zero. this is the limit we are interested in for this paper.

let us introduce the notation

grm() = o()\ o(n, m)/(o(n)  o(m)),

(4)

where  is a lorentzian lattice (which may or may not be even and unimodular) which
has signature (n, m). thus the moduli space of type iia strings on a k3 surface would be
written grm(4,20), where m,n will denote an even unimodular lattice of signature (n, m).
= 4,4  0,8  0,8 where
in our case we decompose the lattice h (sh , z) into 4,20
the latter two lattices represent time-like root lattices of e8.
in order to x the two e8
singularities and set the corresponding components of the b-eld equal to zero we should
delete these latter parts of the h (sh, z) lattice as explained in [21] for example. thus, if
there were no -corrections we might expect

mh = grm(4,4)

(5)

7

from the heterotic picture.

to make contact with the type iia picture we follow the usual f-theory process as
proposed in [19, 20] (see also [21]). let us suppose that sh is actually an elliptic bration
with a section. we may do this as follows. the 4,4 in (5) represents h (sh, z) without the
e8  e8 part coming from the singularities. let us split this as 4,4 = a
2,2. let us split
2,2 = pic(sh)  h 0(sh, z)  h 4(sh, z), where pic(sh) = 1,1 is the picard lattice
further a
of a generic elliptic k3 surface with a section. note that t
2,2 represents the transcendental
2-cycles of sh. these 2-cycles have homology classes which are orthogonal to those of the
algebraic curves. any homology 2-cycle can be split into its algebraic part in pic(sh) and
its transcendental part in t

2,2  t

2,2.

we now have a natural embedding

grm(4,4)  grm(a

2,2)  grm(t

2,2).

(6)

grm(a
2,2) is a 4 real-dimensional space spanned by the value of the complexied kahler form
b + ij on the bre and the section of sh respectively. grm(t
2,2) is a 4 real-dimensional
space representing the remaining deformations of complex structures of sh as an elliptic
bration. note that grm(4,4) had 16 real dimensions and so we have lost 8 real dimensions
in the process of insisting that sh be an elliptic bration with a section.

now start taking limits. first we want to take the type iia string to be weakly coupled.
the dilaton of the type iia string corresponds to the size of the section of sh [21]. thus
we may take the type iia string to be weakly coupled by moving in the right direction in
grm(a

2,2) so as to make the area of the section huge.

if we take the other component of the kahler form to be huge so that the area of the
elliptic bres of sh are also large area then we make every 2-cycle in sh huge (assuming the
complex structure is generic). this will remove all  corrections. this process will involve
moving in a certain direction in the moduli space of complex structures of the threefold x
which results in a stable degeneration of x. this stable degeneration is of course the one
described in section 2. in this limit we expect the remaining two deformations of complex
structure of x to map exactly onto grm(t

2,2).

fortunately all the hard work of performing the identication in this example has already
been done elsewhere [4,15,16]. let us recall the variables dened by (3). the required stable
degeneration is then given by the limit y  0. in this limit there is an explicit map between
x and z and grm(t
2,2) given as follows. first note that there is an isomorphism between
grm(t

2,2) and two j-lines up to discrete identications:

grm(t

2,2) = (z2  z2)\(cid:18)sl(2, r)

u(1)



sl(2, r)

u(1) (cid:19) .

(7)

we refer to [25] for example for details of this isomorphism. then we may map the variables
parametrizing the moduli space of x in (3) to two copies of the j-line by letting j1 and j2

8

be the two solutions of

zj2 + (432  x  1728z)j + x2 = 0.

(8)

all this looks very similar to previous work done in the vector moduli space such as in
kachru et al. [4]. indeed we will follow this work further but it is important to remember
that we are working in the hypermultiplet moduli space and not the vector multiplet space.
in the vector multiplet moduli space case studied in [4] the moduli space given by (7) is
the special kahler moduli space coming from the torus for the heterotic string. in our case
this moduli space (7) is the moduli space of complex structures on the k3 surface for the
heterotic string. in a sense we are working in the mirror side with respect to [4, 12]. we
consider the type iia string on x whereas [4, 12] consider the type iib string on the same
x.

we began with a moduli space of 4 quaternionic dimensions and we have ended up with
a 4 real dimensional space in this stable degeneration limit. let us review the moduli we
have xed or lost by going to this limit. for the type iia string on x:

1. we have lost the 8 r-r moduli which have no eect in the zero string coupling limit.

2. in the type iia picture we have xed the dilaton to zero string coupling and therefore

lost the axion which now lives on a circle of zero radius.

3. we have xed one complex deformation to go the the stable degeneration limit.

correspondingly in the heterotic string picture:

1. we have xed the k3 surface sh to be elliptic with a section. this xes 8 real moduli.

2. we have taken the section to be innite in area. this kills the eect of the associated

b-eld.

3. we have taken the elliptic bre to have innite area. this kills the eect of the

associated b-eld.

in both cases we account for the 12 missing moduli.

4 close to the limit

studying a stable degeneration in this case doesnt tell us anything new except for the fact
that heterotic/type iia duality seems to work nicely. it is more interesting if we try to move
away from this limit.

in particular what happens if we keep the type iia string coupling constant zero (or at
least very small) but we move away from the stable degeneration? the type iia picture will

9

remain exact since we arent switching on any -corrections. on the heterotic side however
we appear to be allowing for some -corrections to appear.

at rst sight you might think that, in terms of the heterotic string, we should study the
part of the moduli space where the section of sh is innite and we give some nonzero value
to the size of the bre. this is not the case and we need to study this process with a little
more care.

as witten argued in [26], any -corrections to the moduli space of the heterotic string
should come from world-sheet instantons wrapping themselves around minimal 2-spheres in
sh. in the stable degeneration of section 2 we have an elliptic k3 surface with innitely
large section and bre. assuming the complex structure is generic this would imply that
every 2-sphere in sh has innite area and so there are no quantum corrections.

let us consider more carefully the nite case away from this limit. we will describe the
moduli space grm(4,4) in terms introduced in [21, 27]. let 4,4 = 1,1  3,3 where 1,1 is
spanned by a light-like vector w and its dual w. a point in grm(4,4) is determined by a
space-like 4-plane   4,4  r. let  = w   be a space-like 3-plane and dene the
vector b by the fact that  is a spanned by  and b and b is perpendicular to any vector
in . we normalize b so that b.w = 1. we then project  and b into 3,3  r to give
the space-like 3-plane  and the vector b. we may write

b = w + w + b,

(9)

for some real positive .

thus a point in gr(4,4) can be specied by a point in gr(3,3), a vector in 3,3  r and
a real number . dierent choices of w  4,4 are identied by the o(4,4) action. for a
given w, dierent choices of w amount to shifts of b by elements of 3,3.

we expect 3,3 to be the integral 2-cohomology of the k3 surface with two e8 singularities,
 to represent the ricci-at metric on sh in the usual way, b to represent the b-eld and
the volume of the k3 surface to be given by 2 + b2 [21].2

the 3-plane  represents the directions in h 2 spanned by the real and imaginary part
of the holomorphic 2-form of sh and by the kahler form. let  represent the two plane
spanned by the holomorphic 2-form and let j be the kahler form. thus  is spanned by 
and j. rotating this decomposition of  into  and j amounts to changing the complex
structure while xing the metric on sh.

let us x a point in the moduli space gr(4,4) and x a choice of w to give a geometrical
interpretation. let e be any vector in 3,3 such that e.e = 2. let us choose  so that it is
orthogonal to e. we are always free to do this for a xed . let us suppose that we are in
the generic situation where e is then the only such vector orthogonal to . in this case e (or
e) must represent a rational curve in sh (see for example [26] for this argument). such a
rational curve is a minimal 2-sphere are thus can give instantons. thus all such 2 vectors
(for one choice of sign) give instantons.

2this volume factor has errors in earlier versions of [21].

10

to compute the area of such a curve we may simply take the dot product of e with j
using the normalization j.j = 2 + b2. thus we may compute the associated area of all of
the instantons without too much diculty in principle from this lattice picture of the moduli
space.

if sh is elliptic with a section we may further decompose 3,3 = pic t

2,2. let pic = 1,1
be spanned by light-like vectors v and v. the complex structure implied by demanding
that sh be elliptic with section implies that we choose   t
2,2  r and j  pic r. let
j = v + v, where j is proportional to j. this xes

j =r (2 + b2)

2

v +s 2 + b2

2

v.

(10)

we are free to declare that the class v represents the elliptic bre and v  v represents the
section. thus the area of the bre is

j.v =s2 + b2

2

,

and the area of the section is

j.(v  v) =r (2 + b2)

2

s 2 + b2

2

.

(11)

(12)

so if we take the limit    then both the bre and the section are innite for generic .
indeed for generic complex structure we see that all 2-spheres in sh are innite as j.j must
be normalized to innity.

to move back from this limit we may let  be nite. it would be nice if we could still
keep the area of the section innite as this would correspond to keeping the type iia string
weakly coupled. we can see we may do this if we allow    while keeping  nite (but
large). this is the limit we use in this paper.

note that in this limit the area of the bre is now zero! this should not be seen as
particularly nasty however as we dont expect the elliptic bre to generate any world-sheet
instantons. what is more interesting is that since  is nite, the normalization of j is nite
and thus for generic values of complex structure, the transcendental 2-spheres in sh will
have nite and nonzero size. what we have is a rather funny-looking k3 surface which
has an enormous 2-sphere as a section, vanishingly small elliptic bres and transcendental
2-spheres which can have any size we wish. the volume of the k3 surface is nite.
it is therefore these transcendental 2-spheres, i.e. the length 2 vectors in t

2,2, which
will be of most interest to us. these are the ones which give nontrivial world-sheet instanton
eects.

figure 2: one-chains producing transcendental 2-cycles.

these transcendental 2-spheres may be visualized without too much diculty in terms
described in [28]. figure 2 depicts the spherical base of the bration together with the
location of the degenerate bres using kodairas notation. note the two e8 singularities
given by ii bres. two transcendental 2-spheres may be made by following the bration
along particular lines joining i1 bres. the idea is that a circle in the elliptic bration shrinks
to zero size at the i1 ends and so this circle sweeps out a 2-sphere. the paths 1 and 2 in
the gure show such paths. the equatorial path 0 in the gure has no monodromy and so
we may make two transcendental tori by transporting either of the two circles in the elliptic
bre along this path.

we may also may 2-spheres which are combinations of these classes. for example path
3 gives a 2-sphere which is homologically equivalent to the sum of the 2 sphere and one of
the tori from 0.

an important thing to note is that these 2-spheres never see the ii bre and as such
they miss anything interesting about the the bundle over sh. we pushed all the point-like
instantons into these ii bres. thus the bundle over the 2-spheres we consider for worldsheet
instantons is always trivial.

there is an awkward point at this stage which we will evade in this paper but which needs
to understood more carefully if we want to understand heterotic worldsheet instantons from
type ii duality. consider a transcendental 2-sphere whose class is given by e  t
2,2. we may
then consider an innity of other 2-spheres whose class is given by e + nv for any n  z. in
the limit    all of these 2-spheres will have exactly the same area as the one given by

12

e. it appears as though this fact makes any instanton sum divergent. clearly a more careful
treatment of the instanton sum in this limit is required.

5 comments on the type iib picture

in this section we briey note some peculiarities of the quantum corrections to the type
iib picture of our model. this section is not relevant to the following sections and may be
skipped if the reader is only interested in the hyperkahler limits.

as discussed in the introduction, the type iib string compactied on y will suer from
both quantum corrections in  and quantum corrections in . it will therefore generically
exhibit worldsheet instanton corrections and spacetime instanton corrections. what is per-
haps surprising is that our picture in the last section implies that it also exhibits mixed
instanton corrections depending on  and  simultaneously.

to see this begin with the   0 limit in which the type iib string has zero coupling
and the section p1 of sh is innitely large. we have worldsheet instantons in the type iib
picture coming from rational curves in y . we also have worldsheet instanton corrections in
the heterotic picture coming from transcendental 2-spheres in sh. if y is rescaled to make
it larger, the rational curves in y become large suppressing the worldsheet instanton cor-
rections. in the heterotic picture, the corresponding deformation makes the transcendental
2-spheres in sh larger resulting in a smaller contribution from the worldsheet instantons.

now let  acquire a small nonzero value for the type iib string. we know that the type
iib string will now pick up corrections from spacetime instantons. in the heterotic picture
the section of sh now becomes nite and we may wrap worldsheet instantons around this p1.
thus the spacetime instantons of the type iib string appear to map to heterotic worldsheet
instantons wrapping the section of sh while the worldsheet instantons of the type iib string
correspond to heterotic worldsheet instantons wrapping the transcendental 2-spheres of sh .
as explained by witten [26] one should get heterotic worldsheet instantons from all the 2-
spheres in sh (assuming the bundle is suitably trivial). in particular there are innitely many
2-spheres which are homologically a combination of the section of sh and the transcendental
2-spheres discussed in the last section. what do heterotic instantons on these mixed 2-
spheres correspond to in the type iib string? clearly they give instanton corrections which
depend both on  and . as such they are instantons that cannot decide whether they
should be considered worldsheet or spacetime instantons! these mixed instantons must
be taken into account beyond the quantum corrections discussed in [29] for example if one
is to obtain an exact answer.

6 the hyperkahler limit

one of the main sources of technical diculties in dealing with the hypermultiplet moduli
space mh is that it is quaternionic kahler and very little is known about the general structure
of quaternionic kahler spaces. we can be less ambitious in the rest of this paper by only
trying to ask about the rigid hyperkahler limit of properties of the moduli space. we should
emphasize that up to this point however our method should be perfectly good in principle
for determining some properties of the full quaternionic kahler moduli space.

taking the hyperkahler limit is completely analogous to asking about the rigid limit of
special kahler geometry. see [30, 31] for example for a discussion of the dierences between
rigid and nonrigid special kahler geometry.

indeed in the very example we are looking at, the rigid limit of the vector multiplet

moduli space was studied in [4]. more general analysis of this limit was explored in [5].

in the language of the heterotic string compactied on a k3 surface the hyperkahler limit
is understood as follows. we may remove quantum corrections by taking the volume of the
k3 surface to innity for a generic complex structure. suppose instead we have a k3 surface
whose complex structure has been carefully chosen so that one minimal 2-sphere has a small
volume. we may try to tune the complex structure so that the 2-sphere maintains its nite
size as we scale the overall volume of the k3 to innity. what we should be left with is a
moduli space for this solitary 2-sphere sitting in a non-compact space. we may similarly
treat a collection of intersecting 2-spheres. the result is that we replace the moduli space of
a compact k3 surface by the moduli space of an ale space.

thus we need to zoom in on a part of the moduli space of complex structures where a
2-sphere is of zero size as we take the stable degeneration limit. this is very easy to do
thanks to the work in [4]. in particular we are very close to the analysis of section 6 of [4].
let us consider a single 2-sphere shrinking down to an a1 singularity for the rst case.
the stable degeneration is y  0 as discussed in section 2. we need to tune x and z so as
to hit the right part of grm(t
2,2) to give a vanishing 2-sphere. we may do this by hitting a
generic point on the discriminant of (8)

(4z  1)(8642z  (x  432)2) = 0.

(13)

if we were talking about vector multiplets as in [4] this would correspond to zooming in on
an su(2) seibergwitten theory.

let u be the complex variable specifying a generic slice through the x-z-plane such that
u = 0 and y = 0 gives a point on the su(2) locus (13). away from but close to y = 0 there
are two solutions to the discriminant in the u-plane. to take the rigid limit we take y  0
while rescaling the u-plane so as to keep these two solutions at xed values, say u = 2.

the dierence with the hypermultiplet moduli space as opposed to the vector multiplet
case is that we need to look at the r-r sector of the type iia moduli. these r-r elds

14

live in the intermediate jacobian h 3(x, u(1)). as such we have a bration over the above
u-plane whose bre is an 8-dimensional torus.

the key point about the rigid limit of special kahler geometry is that the variation of
hodge structure of a calabiyau threefold is replaced by the variation of a hodge structure of
a riemann surface [30, 31]. as such, the intermediate jacobian of the calabiyau threefold
is replaced by the jacobian of the corresponding riemann surface. this observation was
eectively noted in [6, 7].

thus we dont need to do any work to say how the r-r bres behave as we move about
the u-plane. the mini-variation of hodge structure we have zoomed in on by going to
the rigid limit ignores the majority of h 3(x, z). we only care about the part which has
nontrivial monodromy around the u-plane. thus we only need to consider two of the real
r-r elds. these will form an elliptic bration over the u-plane and of course this is exactly
the elliptic bration considered by seiberg and witten in their original paper [32].

we arrive at the conclusion that the interesting part of the moduli space describing the
acquiring of an a1 singularity in the heterotic string consists of a space with 4 real dimensions
consisting of the natural elliptic bration over the seibergwitten plane for an su(2) gauge
theory (with no avours).

given that the moduli space is hyperkahler and thus ricci-at, this describes the moduli
space precisely except for one thing. we need to specify the area of the elliptic bre. this
is the part of the analysis that is quite dicult in our picture. to do this properly we need
to be careful about the rate at which we zoom in on the moduli space to obtain the rigid
limit while we take the type iia string to be weakly-coupled. since analyzing the type iia
string at nonzero coupling is rather dicult we will not attempt such an analysis here. what
is more, we already know the answer anyway thanks to seiberg and witten [2,3]. the result
is that the elliptic curve should be taken to have innite area. in this case we recover the
atiyahhitchin moduli space of 2 su(2) monopoles [33]. this is also the same as the moduli
space of n = 4 su(2) yangmills in 3 dimensions.

it should now be immediately clear that we may use this same example to probe the
heterotic string near an a2 singularity. the point in grm(t
2,2) which gives such a singularity
is given by j1 = j2 = 0 and thus by x = 0 and z = 1
4. this is exactly the point studied in [4]
to recover su(3) seibergwitten theory. thus we claim that the corresponding moduli space
for hypermultiplets is an abelian bration over the su(3) seibergwitten theory where the
abelian bre is given by the jacobian of the seibergwitten curve for su(3) and the volume
of this bre we take to be innite again. this is the same as the moduli space of n = 4
su(3) yangmills in 3 dimensions by the arguments in [3].

7 point-like instantons

we may modify this example to liberate one of the point-like e8 instantons from one of
the singularities in sh. in other words we need to take x through an extremal transition

15

figure 3: one point-like e8 instanton liberated.

to allow one more deformation of complex structure. let us call this required calabiyau
space x1. thus h2,1(x1) = h2,1(x) + 1.

we may obtain x1 by directly trying to engineer one e8 point-like instanton at a generic
point on sh while keeping everything the same as the previous situation. from standard f-
theory lore [20,34] we need to replace the upper-right diagram in gure 1 by that in gure 3.
the collision on the left side of the square represents to location of the point-like instanton.
this is explained in detail in [35].

working backwards to the corresponding upper-left picture in gure 1 it is not hard to

show that x1 is dened by the equation

fx1 = fx + a8x6

2x7

3x5
4,

(14)

where fx is the dening equation of x (written as a singular form of y ) given by (2).

thus, the analogue of the geometric engineering story we did in the last section is to
consider what theory we would engineer in four dimensions if we compactied the type iia
string on y1, the mirror of x1. our desired moduli space would then correspond to the
hyperkahler moduli space given by reducing this four dimensional theory to one in three
dimensions.

to understand the geometry of y1 we have depicted a part of the corresponding toric
picture in gure 4. this diagram shows a slice of the toric data representing y1 `a la batyrev
[36]. each vertex represents a divisor in y1 and corresponds to a monomial in the mirror
x1 [37]. we have labelled each vertex accordingly. the vertex labelled by a2 represents
the divisor given to rst approximation by p1  c0 for some curve c0. this is obtained by
blowing up the curve c0 of z2-xed points. the lines c1 and c2 in the gure represent two
p1s with normal bundle o(1, 1) which replace the generic p1 for a particular point on
c0. thus the divisor corresponding to a0 is a bundle over c0 where every bre is p1 except
for one point where this bre splits into two p1s.

what we have described is precisely the geometric engineering picture of an su(2)u(1)
gauge theory in four dimensions with a hypermultiplet in the 2 of su(2) charged with respect
to the u(1) [5].

thus we arrive at the conclusion that the act of letting a free point-like e8 instanton
interact with our a1 singularity is tantamount to adding a avour to the seibergwitten
theory and a gauging the associated u(1) baryon number symmetry.

without much eort one can see that adding the term a9x6

4 gives us another calabi
yau space x2 which corresponds to two point-like instantons oating about the k3 surface
sh. y2 then has a ruled surface where one of the bres becomes a chain of three p1s. this
is the geometry of the picture of an su(2)  u(1)2 gauge theory in four dimensions with two
charged 2s [5].

2x5

3x7

although we will not try to prove the general case, the result is fairly self-evident leading
to proposition 1 of the introduction. note in particular that once we have 4 or more point-
like instantons at an a1 singularity, we obtain more gauge symmetry and so we have a phase
transition leading to more vector multiplets in the four-dimensional theory. this is in perfect
correspondence to the fact that seibergwitten theory for su(2)  u(1)k has a higgs branch
for k  4.

it is interesting to note that it was shown in [20] that k  2n point-like e8 instantons
coalescing at an an1 singularity yields a theory with a gauge group in the classical limit
given by3

gn,k

= su(2)  su(3)  . . .  su(n  1)  su(n)(k2n+1)  su(n  1)  . . .  su(2),

fundamentals under the two su(2) factors and under the rst and last su(n)s. as such,
once we include quantum corrections we expect the moduli space of the coulomb branch of
our four-dimensional theory to be given by the seibergwitten theory of this group gn,k.

the astute reader will immediately notice that this yields precisely the theory in which
in three dimensions is the intriligatorseiberg mirror of a theory with gauge symmetry
su(n)  u(1)k [38, 39].

this is explained as follows (see also [8] and particularly [40]4 for some closely-related
comments). recall the following language for an extremal transition. when in four di-
mensions the coulomb phase is part of the moduli space of mv and is thus special kahler
where the higgs phase is part of mh and is thus quaternionic kahler. if we dimensionally
reduce this to three dimensions there is no intrinsic distinction between vector multiplets
and hypermultiplets  they both give a quaternionic kahler moduli space. even including
quantum corrections these multiplets do not mix however and we may still logically label
them by their four dimensional origin.

we have argued that the moduli space of k instantons on an an1 singularity is given
by the coulomb branch of an su(n)  u(1)k theory in three dimensions. this has a phase
transition to a higgs branch. the results of [20] tell us that this higgs branch is actually
given by the coulomb branch of a theory with gauge group gn,k in three dimensions. thus
the higgs branch of su(n)  u(1)k is isomorphic to the coulomb branch of gn,k. this is
a statement of intriligatorseiberg mirror symmetry. here we have deduced it from the
mirror symmetry of an x-type manifold whose stable degeneration represents the heterotic
string picture and the mirror y -type which would be used to geometrically engineer the
corresponding moduli space.

note that we could not have used intriligatorseiberg mirror symmetry to deduce the

examples we discussed for small k. here the theory has no phase transition.

given the plethora of heterotic string pictures which are understood in f-theory [11,14,20]

one should be able to extend the analysis of this paper to many more examples.
