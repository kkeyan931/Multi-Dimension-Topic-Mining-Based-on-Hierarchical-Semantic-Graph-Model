abstract

we present dyon solutions to an su (2) dirac-born-infeld (dbi) gauge theory
coupled to a higgs triplet. we consider dierent non-abelian extensions of
the dbi action and study the resulting solutions numerically, comparing them
with the standard julia-zee dyons. we discuss the existence of a critical value
of , the born-infeld absolute eld parameter, below which the solution ceases
to exist. we also analyse the eect of modifying the dbi action so as to include
the analogous of the  term, showing that witten formula for the dyon charge
also holds in dbi theories.

i. introduction

the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action describes the low energy dynamics of d-branes [1].
in this respect, classical solutions to the dbi equations of motion have recently received
much attention and several bion, soliton and instanton congurations have been already
found [2]- [11].

concerning monopole solutions to dbi theory, dierent possibilities have been discussed,
either by considering extensions of the dbi action that admit bps equations [6] (which are
then necessarily the same as in the yang-mills-higgs system [12]) or by coupling the dbi
action to the usual symmetry breaking higgs lagrangian [9]- [10].
in this last case, t
hooft-polyakov-like monopole solutions arise provided , the born-infeld absolute eld
parameter, is bigger than a critical value c [7], [9].

we extend in the present work the analysis of purely magnetic solutions of ref. [9] by
constructing electrically charged monopole solutions to an su(2) dbi theory coupled to a
higgs eld in the adjoint, with a potential that breaks the symmetry down to u(1). since the
dbi action contains a (f f )2 term which vanishes unless electric and magnetic elds are
both present, dyons test more in detail dbi nonlinearities than purely magnetic monopoles.
moreover, one can discuss in this case some issues concerning witten eect [13] and duality
[14] in dbi models.

the paper is organized as follows: we start in section ii by discussing two alternative
ways in which an abelian dbi action can be extended to the case of an su(2) gauge theory
depending on the trace operation used to dene a scalar action from non-abelian elds
[15]. then, we consider the addition of a higgs action with a symmetry breaking potential
and discuss the resulting equations of motion for both trace operations. in section iii we
discuss dyon congurations by considering the usual julia-zee ansatz [16]- [18]. we nd
the solutions numerically and discuss their main properties. the eect of adding a -term is
studied in section iv where the rules of charge quantization are discussed in detail. finally,
we present in section v a summary of our results and conclusions.

ii. the action

for a non-abelian gauge group, there are alternative denitions of the dirac-born-infeld
action [15], [20]- [25]. basically, they dier in the way a scalar action is constructed using
dierent trace operations over the group indices. as shown by tseytlin [15], there is one
which is singled out by the fact that it leads to an action which can be connected to the
tree level string eective action for branes. the corresponding lagrangian is

dbi  2str 1 sdet(g +
lstr

1


f)!

here str is a symmetric trace operation dened by the formula

str(t1, t2, . . . , tn ) 

1

n! x

tr(t(1)t(2) . . . t(n ))

(1)

(2)

with ta the generators of the gauge group which we shall take for simplicity in the funda-
mental representation of su(2), normalized so that

2

tr(tatb) = ab

(3)

remarkably, denition (1) is equivalent to the familiar born-infeld form for the lagrangian

dbi = 2str 1 s1 +
lstr

1
22 ff  

1

164 (f f )2! .

(4)

in contrast, if one were to use the tr trace operation in the denition of the dbi action
as a determinant like in (1), (of course one has to supplement the denition with some
ordering rule for multiplying determinant elements) its explicit computation would not lead
to the analogous of (4). one can instead directly dene an alternative dbi lagrangian as

dbi = 2tr 1 s1 +
ltr

1
22 ff  

1

164 (f f )2! .

(5)

we shall then consider both possibilites, taking as dbi non-abelian lagrangian (4) and (5).
apart from this alternative related to the way the trace operation is dened, one has
to decide how the higgs eld dynamics is introduced. one possibility is to construct dbi
monopoles by demanding that the usual yang-mills-higgs bps relations also hold in the
dbi case [6]. this amounts to dene a higgs eld lagrangian in a born-infeld-like way
(i.e., with the scalar kinetic energy and potential terms also under a square root) in such
a way that the model have a supersymmetric extension [4], [23]- [25]. one can then prove
that the bps relations coincide with those arising in the yang-mills-higgs case [12], so that
the resulting dbi monopole solutions are identical to the well-honored prasad-sommereld
exact solutions and have no specic features resulting from the dbi dynamics. instead, we
shall consider here, as already done in [9] for purely magnetic solutions, the usual su(2)
higgs eld lagrangian and a symmetry breaking potential not necessarily in the bps limit.
we then propose the following lagrangian for the higgs eld:

with the scalar triplet written in the form

lhiggs =

d~.d

~  v []

the symmetry breaking potential given by

 = ata = ~  ~t ,

v [] =

and the covariant derivative dened as

d~ = ~ + e ~a  ~ .
concerning the eld strength f = ~f.~t, it is dened as
~f =  ~a   ~a + e ~a  ~a

note that in order to perform the trace operation in the resulting equations of motion,
one has to expand the square root and then proceed to the explicit evaluation of traces.
while the normal trace operation tr allows to reaccomodate the expansion as the square
root appearing in (13), this is not the case for the symmetric trace. then, one is left with
equations of motion that correspond to a 1/2 expansion. we just quote here the lagrangian

here m is a parameter with the dimensions of a mass which has to satisfy m < e/ to
have an appropriate asymptotic behavior for k(r) [18]. concerning b, it determines, as we
shall see, the electric charge. concerning the conditions at the origin, we take

k(0) = 1 ,

j(0) = 0 ,

h(0) = 0.

the electromagnetic u(1) eld strength f is dened as usual [16] in the form

in the case of a born-infeld theory, it is necessary to also dene the electromagnetic u(1)
 which we shall call g. following the same steps as those leading to f

projection of ga
(see (27)), we start from

here tr indicates any one of the two possible trace choices referred above and r is dened
as

now, inspired in (27) we consider the shift

to obtain a detailed prole of the dyon solutions we have solved numerically the dif-
ferential equations (37) employing a relaxation method for boundary value problems [26].
such a method determines the solution by starting with an initial guess and improving it
iteratively. the natural initial guess was the exact prasad-sommereld solution [27] which
corresponds to  = 0 and   .
for  > 10, the solutions to eqs.(37) do not dier appreciably from the julia-zee dyon
solution [18]. as  decreases, the solution changes slowly: the dyon radius decreases and
the (radial) electric and magnetic elds, ~e and ~h respectively, concentrate at the origin.
some of the solution proles are depicted in gures (1)-(2). it should be noted that in the
limit m  0 we recover the dbi pure monopole solutions [9].
as it happens for other soliton-like solutions in dbi-higgs theories [7], [9], there is a
critical value of  which we call c such that for   c the dyon solution ceases to exist.
this can be clearly seen in gure 3, where the energy is plotted as a function of . as 
approaches c the derivative of the energy with respect to  diverges. we have found that
c  0.55 and it does not depend on  nor on m . this yields a critical dyon radius which is
0.85 of the standard yang-mills dyon radius (which can be recovered in the    limit)
for m =  = 0.5.
the existence of c is not a byproduct of our numerical method but a genuine eect. as
we have thoroughfully discussed in [9], the origin of this phenomenon could be traced back to
the existence, in dbi theories, of a second dimensionful parameter  ([] = 2) which enters
together with  in the minimization of the energy. indeed, by using approximate solutions,
we have seen in [9] for pure monopoles (and the same analysis could be done for dyons) that
there exist a region in the parameter space dened by the dimensionless combinations  and
, for which the energy has no minima. this region precisely corresponds to small values of
. of course for the yang-mills-higgs system, where the second dimensionless parameter is
absent, solutions exist in the whole  range.

one can rephrase the analysis above by noting that when  decreases, the dyon radius also
decreases, as can be seen in gures 1-2. the existence of a critical  = c then corresponds
to the existence of a minimal radius below which the dyon (or monopole) cannot exist. this
is reminiscent of an analogous phenomenon that takes place for self-gravitating monopoles
[28]- [32]: they show an instability for suciently strong gravitational coupling, manifesting
itself as an extremal blackhole in its exterior region and a more involved solution inside.
in other words, non-linearities introduced by the dbi action have a similar eect as that
produced when the coupling to gravity becomes relevant.

7

(ii) the solution for lstr

dbihiggs

as stated above, in order to handle the symmetric trace lagrangian, one has to keep a
nite number of terms in the expansion of the dbi square root. then, to order 1/2, one
can insert in the eqs. of motion (17)-(19) the ansatz [16]- [18]. we shall not display the
resulting equations but briey discuss their numerical solution.

for   2 the solutions dier less than 1% from those arising when the usual trace
(tr) operation is considered. the prole of the solutions are indistinguishable from the
solid line curves of gures 1-2. as  decreases, the dyon radius decreases with the same rate
as in the usual trace case. this signals the existence of a c also in the symmetric trace
case. however, since the equations of motion are valid to order 1/ 2, our analysis cannot
be reliable for small  and the region where one expects to nd c lies outside the validity
range of our approximation.

iv. a  term

when the yang-mills-higgs lagrangian includes a cp violating -term, a remarkable
eect takes place: a dyon solution with quantum electric charge q = nee and magnetic
charge g = 4/e shifts its electric charge according to the relation [13]

q = nee +

e
2

(41)

here e is the unit electric charge, ne an integer and a unit magnetic charge has been consid-
ered. relation (41) was originally obtained considering an su(2) gauge theory spontaneously
broken to u(1) by the vacuum expectation value of a higgs triplet, using semiclassical argu-
ments and also by canonical methods. in this last approach, one denes the operator n that
generates gauge transformations around the u(1) (electromagnetic) surviving symmetry and
then imposes as an operator statement

now, when the lagrangian includes a cp violating term of the form

exp(2in) = i

l = 

e2
322 tr ff 

(42)

(43)

one can see that the condition (42) implies formula (41). for a general dyon solution, one
gets

with the magnetic charge g expressed as a multiple of the unit t hooft-polyakov charge,

q = nee +

e
2

nm

(44)

g =

4
e

nm

(45)

in this section we analize whether a similar phenomenon can take place in the non-

abelian dirac-born-infeld theory we have described above.

8

let us rst recall that in yang-mills theory, a -term can be generated by the action of

an so(2) rotation followed by a scaling of the eld strength [19]. indeed, if one considers

f 

1

cos 2 (cid:16)cos f  sin  f(cid:17)

(46)

then, a  term of the form (43) can be generated from a (1/4)trff  term, with 
related to  through the formula

tan(2) =

e2
82

(47)

we shall now see that the same transformation changes the dirac-born-infeld lagrangian
in such a way that when one computes the electric charge of dyons, witten eect takes place
exactly as in yang-mills theory.

we start then by analysing the eect of transformations (46) in the dbi action. for
deniteness, we shall consider the case in which the dbi action is dened using the symmetric
trace. then, performing the change (46) in (1), one gets

dbi = 2str
l

which can be also written in the form

1 vuutdet g +

1

cos 2 (cid:16)cos f  sin  f(cid:17)!


l = 2str

(48)

(49)

in contrast with the case of ym theory, where the addition of a -term does not change
the eqs. of motion ( f f is a surface term), here, rotation (46) leads to eqs. of motion that
dier from the  = 0 ones. then, one has to see whether dyon solutions still exist for  6= 0.
now, studying the modied system of eqs. of motion to the order worked out in the  = 0
case (i.e., up to the order 1/ 2) one can easily see that its solutions coincide (if one rescales
 conveniently) with the  = 0 ones.

having found that dyon solutions exist when a  term is present, we are now ready
to explicitly write the operator n that generates the transformations associated with the
surviving symmetry. one has to consider u(1) transformations along the higgs eld direction
,

u (1) = 0
1
e

u (1)a =

d( )

(50)

then, the corresponding conserved current picks a contribution solely from the dbi la-
grangian,

j u (1)

 (aa )

dbi

u (1)aa 

and the conserved charge n then takes the form

n = z d3xj u (1)

condition (42) implies that n has to have integer eigenvalues ne. calling q and g the
eigenvalues of the electric and magnetic charge operators q and m respectively, we then
have

q = ene +

e2
82 g

(58)

now, we have seen that the dbi theory with a  term admits monopole solutions with
unit magnetic charge g = (4/e) so that formula (58) coincides with (44) obtained for the
georgi-glashow model if one considers a solution with nm units of magnetic charge. we then
conclude that for the dbi model with  term the basic formulae (44) and (45) hold. one can
then introduce the complex parameter  [14] and, from the resulting discrete two-dimensional
lattice, infer the existence of a discrete sl(2, z) symmetry. of course to thoroughfully study
electric-magnetic duality, one should at this point consider the supersymmetric extension of
dbi models but this goes beyond the scope of the present investigation.

10

v. summary and conclusions

we have seen that spontaneously broken dirac-born-infeld su(2) gauge theory admits
dyon solutions which, in the range  > c behave as julia-zee dyons in yang-mills theory.
as the absolute eld parameter  decreases, the radius of the dyon also decreases so that
the magnetic and electric eld become more and more concentrated. for   c we have
seen that the dyon solution ceases to exist, much in the way self-gravitating monopole and
dyon solutions become unstable when coupling to gravity is suciently strong: in both cases
there is a minimum radius below which the solution collapses.

once the existence of monopole and dyon solutions is proven, it is natural to consider
whether the analogue of witten eect takes place in theories in which the gauge eld dy-
namics is dictated by a dbi action. to study this issue, one has to include a theta term
which, in the present case, arises naturally after an so(2) rotation in f is performed.
remarkably, athough this shift greatly complicates the dbi dynamics, one can prove, using
the noether method, that the dyon electric charge is shifted exactly in the same way as in
the yang-mills case. this makes natural to study the issue of duality in the supersymmetric
extension of dbi theory [25], [12]. we hope to discuss this problem in a future work.
