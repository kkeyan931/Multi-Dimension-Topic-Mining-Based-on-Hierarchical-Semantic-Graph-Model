introduction

planar physics  physics in two spatial dimensions  presents many interesting surprises, both ex-
perimentally and theoretically. the behaviour of electrons and photons [or more generally: fermions
and gauge elds] diers in interesting ways from the standard behaviour we are used to in classical
and quantum electrodynamics. for example, there exists a new type of gauge theory, completely
dierent from maxwell theory, in 2 + 1 dimensions . this new type of gauge theory is known as
a chern-simons theory [the origin of this name is discussed below in section 2.6 on nonabelian
theories]. these chern-simons theories are interesting both for their theoretical novelty, and for
their practical application for certain planar condensed matter phenomena, such as the fractional
quantum hall eect [see steve girvins lectures at this school].

in these lectures i concentrate on eld theoretic properties of chern-simons theories. i have
attempted to be relatively self-contained, and accessible to someone with a basic knowledge of eld
theory. actually, several important new aspects of chern-simons theory rely only on quantum
mechanics and classical electrodynamics. given the strong emphasis of this summer school on
condensed matter phenomena, i have chosen, wherever possible, to phrase the discussion in terms
of quantum mechanical and solid state physics examples. for example, in discussing the canonical
quantization of chern-simons theories, rather than delving deeply into conformal eld theory,
instead i have expressed things in terms of the landau problem [quantum mechanical charged
particles in a magnetic eld] and the magnetic translation group.

in section 2, i introduce the basic kinematical and dynamical features of planar eld theories,
such as anyons, topologically massive gauge elds and planar fermions. i also discuss the discrete
symmetries p, c and t , and nonabelian chern-simons gauge theories. section 3 is devoted to the
canonical structure and canonical quantization of chern-simons theories. this is phrased in quan-
tum mechanical language using a deep analogy between chern-simons gauge theories and quantum
mechanical landau levels [which are so important in the understanding of the fractional quantum
hall eect]. for example, this connection gives a very simple understanding of the origin of mas-
sive gauge excitations in chern-simons theories. in section 4, i consider the self-dual vortices that
arise when chern-simons gauge elds are coupled to scalar matter elds, with either relativistic or
nonrelativistic dynamics. such vortices are interesting examples of self-dual eld theoretic struc-
tures with anyonic properties, and also arise in models for the fractional quantum hall eect where
they correspond to laughlins quasipartcle excitations. the nal section concerns chern-simons
terms that are induced radiatively by quantum eects. these can appear in fermionic theories, in
maxwell-chern-simons models and in chern-simons models with spontaneous symmetry break-
ing. the topological nature of the induced term has interesting consequences, especially at nite
temperature.

we begin by establishing some gauge theory notation. the familiar maxwell (or, in the non-
abelian case, yang-mills) gauge theory is dened in terms of the fundamental gauge eld (connec-
tion) a = (a0, ~a). here a0 is the scalar potential and ~a is the vector potential. the maxwell
lagrangian

lm = 

f f   aj 

(1)

4

is expressed in terms of the eld strength tensor (curvature) f = a   a, and a matter

3

current j  that is conserved: j  = 0. this maxwell lagrangian is manifestly invariant under the
gauge transformation a  a +; and, correspondingly, the classical euler-lagrange equations
of motion
(2)

f  = j 

are gauge invariant. observe that current conservation  j  = 0 follows from the antisymmetry of
f .

now note that this maxwell theory could easily be dened in any space-time dimension d simply
by taking the range of the space-time index  on the gauge eld a to be  = 0, 1, 2, . . . , (d  1)
in d-dimensional space-time. the eld strength tensor is still the antisymmetric tensor f =
a   a, and the maxwell lagrangian (1) and the equations of motion (2) do not change
their form. the only real dierence is that the number of independent elds contained in the eld
[since f can be regarded as a d  d
strength tensor f is dierent in dierent dimensions.
antisymmetric matrix, the number of elds is equal to 1
2 d(d 1).] so at this level, planar (i.e. 2 + 1
dimensional ) maxwell theory is quite similar to the familiar 3 + 1 dimensional maxwell theory.
the main dierence is simply that the magnetic eld is a (pseudo-) scalar b = ijiaj in 2 + 1
dimensions , rather than a (pseudo-) vector ~b = ~ ~a in 3 + 1 dimensions . this is just because in
2 + 1 dimensions the vector potential ~a is a two-dimensional vector, and the curl in two dimensions
~a is a two dimensional vector.
produces a scalar. on the other hand, the electric eld ~e = ~a0
so the antisymmetric 3  3 eld strength tensor has three nonzero eld components: two for the
electric eld ~e and one for the magnetic eld b.
the real novelty of 2+1 dimensions is that instead of considering this reduced form of maxwell
theory, we can also dene a completely dierent type of gauge theory: a chern-simons theory. it
satises our usual criteria for a sensible gauge theory  it is lorentz invariant, gauge invariant, and
local. the chern-simons lagrangian is

lcs =


2

aa  aj 

(3)

there are several comments to make about this chern-simons lagrangian. first, it does not
look gauge invariant, because it involves the gauge eld a itself, rather than just the (manifestly
gauge invariant) eld strength f . nevertheless, under a gauge transformation, the chern-simons
lagrangian changes by a total space-time derivative

lcs =


2

 ( a) .

(4)

therefore, if we can neglect boundary terms (later we shall encounter important examples where

this is not true) then the corresponding chern-simons action, scs = r d3xlcs, is gauge invariant.

this is reected in the fact that the classical euler-lagrange equations


2

f = j ;

or equivalently :

f =

1


j 

(5)

are clearly gauge invariant. note that the bianchi identity, f = 0, is compatible with
current conservation : j  = 0.

4

a second important feature of the chern-simons lagrangian (3) is that it is rst-order in space-
time derivatives. this makes the canonical structure of these theories signicantly dierent from
that of maxwell theory. a related property is that the chern-simons lagrangian is particular to
2 + 1 dimensions , in the sense that we cannot write down such a term in 3 + 1 dimensions  the
indices simply do not match up. actually, it is possible to write down a chern-simons theory in
any odd space-time dimension, but it is only in 2 + 1 dimensions that the lagrangian is quadratic
in the gauge eld. for example, the chern-simons lagrangian in ve-dimensional space-time is
l =  a aa .
at rst sight, pure chern-simons theory looks rather boring, and possibly trivial, because
the source-free classical equations of motion (5) reduce to f = 0, the solutions of which are
just pure gauges or at connections. this is in contrast to pure maxwell theory, where even the
sourcefree theory has interesting, and physically important, solutions : plane-waves. nevertheless,
chern-simons theory can be made interesting and nontrivial in a number of ways:

(i) coupling to dynamical matter elds (charged scalars or fermions)
(ii) coupling to a maxwell term
(iii) taking the space-time to have nontrivial topology
(iv) nonabelian gauge elds
(v) gravity
i do not discuss 2 + 1 dimensional gravity in these lectures as it is far from the topic of this
school, but i stress that it is a rich subject that has taught us a great deal about both classical
and quantum gravity [1].

2 basics of planar field theory

2.1 chern-simons coupled to matter fields - anyons

in order to understand the signicance of coupling a matter current j  = (, ~j ) to a chern-simons
gauge eld, consider the chern-simons equations (5) in terms of components :

 = b
j i = ijej

(6)

the rst of these equations tells us that the charge density is locally proportional to the magnetic
eld  thus the eect of a chern-simons eld is to tie magnetic ux to electric charge. wherever
there is one, there is the other, and they are locally proportional, with the proportionality constant
given by the chern-simons coupling parameter . this is illustrated in figure 1 for a collection of
point charges. the second equation in (6) ensures that this charge-ux relation is preserved under
time evolution because the time derivative of the rst equation

together with current conservation,

 =  b = iji aj

 + ij i = 0, implies that
j i = ij aj + ijj

figure 1: a collection of point anyons with charge e, and with magnetic ux lines of strength e

tied to the charges. the charge and ux are tied together throughout the motion of the particles
as a result of the chern-simons equations (6).

which is just the second equation in (6), with the transverse piece  identied with a0.

thus, the chern-simons coupling at this level is pure constraint  we can regard the matter elds
as having their own dynamics, and the eect of the chern-simons coupling is to attach magnetic
ux to the matter charge density in such a way that it follows the matter charge density wherever
it goes. clearly, this applies either to relativistic or nonrelativistic dynamics for the matter elds.
(a word of caution here - although the chern-simons term is lorentz invariant, we can regard this
simply as a convenient shorthand for expressing the constraint equations (6), in much the same
way as we can always express a continuity equation  + ij i = 0 in a relativistic-looking way as
j  = 0. thus, there is no problem mixing nonrelativistic dynamics for the matter elds with a
relativistic-looking chern-simons term. the actual dynamics is always inherited from the matter
elds.)

this tying of ux to charge provides an explicit realization of anyons [2, 3]. (for more details
on anyons, see jan myrheims lectures at this school). consider, for example, nonrelativistic point
charged particles moving in the plane, with magnetic ux lines attached to them. the charge
density

describes n such particles, with the ath particle following the trajectory ~xa(t). the corresponding

the chern-simons equations of motion (5) determine the gauge eld a(~x, t) in terms of the
particle current. the gauge freedom may be xed in a hamiltonian formulation by taking a0 = 0
and imposing ~  ~a = 0. then

log |~x  ~y|(cid:19) = (2)(~x  ~y)

(13)

as an aside, note that using the identity iarg(~x) = ijxj/|~x|2, where the argument function

is arg(~x) = arctan( y

x ), we can express this vector potential (12) as

ai(~x) =

e

2

n

xa=1

(14)

naively, this looks like a pure gauge vector potential, which could presumably therefore be re-
moved by a gauge transformation. however, under such a gauge transformation the corresponding
nonrelativistic eld (~x) would acquire a phase factor

(~x)  (~x) = exp i

arg(~x  ~xa)! (~x)

n

xa=1

(15)

which makes the eld non-single-valued for general values of the chern-simons coupling parameter
. this lack of single-valuedness is the nontrivial remnant of the chern-simons gauge eld coupling.
thus, even though it looks as though the gauge eld has been gauged away, leaving a free system,
the complicated statistical interaction is hidden in the nontrivial boundary conditions for the non-
single-valued eld .

returning to the point-anyon action (11), the hamiltonian for this system is

so that each particle sees each of the n 1 others as a point vortex of ux  = e
 , as expected. note
that the gauge eld in (17) excludes the self-interaction a = b term, with suitable regularization
[3, 4].

figure 2: aharonov-bohm interaction between the charge e of an anyon and the ux e
 of another
anyon under double-interchange. under such an adiabatic transport, the multi-anyon wavefunction
acquires an aharonov-bohm phase (19).

an important consequence of this charge-ux coupling is that it leads to new aharonov-bohm-
type interactions. for example, when one such particle moves adiabatically around another [as
shown in figure 2], in addition to whatever electrical interactions mediate between them, at the
quantum level the nonrelativistic wavefunction acquires an aharonov-bohm phase

if this adiabatic excursion is interpreted as a double interchange of two such identical particles
(each with ux attached), then this gives an anyonic exchange phase

which can be tuned to any value by specifying the value of the chern-simons coupling coecient
. this is the origin of anyonic statistics in point-particle language.

this is a rst-quantized description of anyons as point particles. however, n-anyon quantum
mechanics can be treated, in the usual manner of nonrelativistic many-body quantum mechanics,
as the n-particle sector of a nonrelativistic quantum eld theory [3, 4]. in this case, a chern-simons
eld is required to ensure that the appropriate magnetic ux is always attached to the (smeared-out)
charged particle elds (~x, t). this, together with the above-mentioned statistics transmutation,
explains the appearance of chern-simons elds in the composite boson or composite fermion
models for the fractional quantum hall eect, which involve quasiparticles that have magnetic uxes
attached to charged particles [5, 6, 7, 8]. in such eld theories there is a generalized spin-statistics
relation similar to (20)  see later in eq. (100). by choosing  appropriately, the anyonic exchange
phase (20) can be chosen so that the particles behave either as fermions or as bosons. an explicit
example of this statistical transmutation will be used in section 4.6 on the zhang-hansson-kivelson
model [5] for the fractional quantum hall eect.

2.2 maxwell-chern-simons : topologically massive gauge theory

since both the maxwell and chern-simons lagrangians produce viable gauge theories in 2 + 1
dimensions , it is natural to consider coupling them together. the result is a surprising new form
of gauge eld mass generation. consider the lagrangian

lmcs = 
the resulting classical eld equations are

f  +

e2

f = 0

(21)

(22)

which describe the propagation of a single (transverse) degree of freedom with mass (note that e2
has dimensions of mass in 2 + 1 dimensions , while  is dimensionless):

mmcs = e2

(23)

this has resulted in the terminology topologically massive gauge theory [9], where the term
topological is motivated by the nonabelian chern-simons theory (see section 2.6).

the most direct way to see the origin of this mass is to re-write the equation of motion (22) in

terms of the pseudovector dual eld f   1

2 f:

h + (e2)2i f  = 0

(24)

note that this dual eld f  is manifestly gauge invariant, and it also satises  f  = 0. the mcs
mass can also be identied from the corresponding representation theory of the poincare algebra
in 2 + 1-dimensions , which also yields the spin of the massive excitation as

smcs =

= 1


||

9

(25)

we shall discuss these mass and spin properties further in section 2.5.

exercise 2.2.1 : another useful way to understand the origin of the massive gauge excitation
is to compute the gauge eld propagator in (for example) a covariant gauge with gauge xing term
2e2 (a)2. by inverting the quadratic part of the momentum space lagrangian, show
lgf =  1
that the gauge eld propagator is

 = e2  p2g  pp  ie2p

p2(p2  2e4)

+ 

pp

(p2)2!

(26)

this clearly identies the gauge eld mass via the pole at p2 = (e2)2.

i emphasize that this gauge eld mass (23) is completely independent of the standard higgs
mechanism for generating masses for gauge elds through a nonzero expectation value of a higgs
eld. indeed, we can also consider the higgs mechanism in a maxwell-chern-simons theory, in
which case we nd two independent gauge eld masses. for example, couple this maxwell-chern-
simons theory to a complex scalar eld  with a symmetry breaking potential v (||)

lmcsh = 

1
4e2 f f  +


2

aa + (d) d  v (||)

(27)

where v (||) has some nontrivial minimum with <  >= v. in this broken vacuum there is an
additional quadratic term v2aa in the gauge eld lagrangian which leads to the momentum
space propagator (with a covariant gauge xing term) [10]

(30)

from the propagator (28) we identify two physical mass poles at p2 = m2
.

the counting of degrees of freedom goes as follows. in the unbroken vacuum, the complex scalar
eld has two real massive degrees of freedom and the gauge eld has one massive excitation (with
mass coming from the chern-simons term). in the broken vacuum, one component of the scalar

10

eld (the goldstone boson) combines with the longitudinal part of the gauge eld to produce a
new massive gauge degree of freedom. thus, in the broken vacuum there is one real massive scalar
degree of freedom (the higgs boson) and two massive gauge degrees of freedom.

the higgs mechanism also occurs, albeit somewhat dierently, if the gauge eld has just a
chern-simons term, and no maxwell term [11]. the maxwell term can be decoupled from the
maxwell-chern-simons-higgs lagrangian (27) by taking the limit

which leads to the chern-simons-higgs lagrangian

(32)

(33)

which has a single massive pole at p2 = ( 2v2

 )2.

the counting of degrees of freedom is dierent in this chern-simons- higgs model.

in the
unbroken vacuum the gauge eld is nonpropagating, and so there are just the two real scalar modes
of the scalar eld . in the broken vacuum, one component of the scalar eld (the goldstone
boson) combines with the longitudinal part of the gauge eld to produce a massive gauge degree
of freedom. thus, in the broken vacuum there is one real massive scalar degree of freedom (the
higgs boson) and one massive gauge degree of freedom. this may also be deduced from the mass
formulae (30) for the maxwell-chern-simons-higgs model, which in the limit (31) tend to

m+  

m 

2v2


(34)

so that one mass m+ decouples to innity, while the other mass m agrees with the mass pole
found in (33). in section 3.2 we shall see that there is a simple way to understand these various
gauge masses in terms of the characteristic frequencies of the familiar quantum mechanical landau
problem.

2.3 fermions in 2 + 1-dimensions

fermion elds also have some new and interesting features when restricted to the plane. the most
obvious dierence is that the irreducible set of dirac matrices consists of 2  2 matrices, rather

11

(i  ea  m)  = 0,

or

i

(35)


t

 = (cid:16)i~  ~ + m(cid:17) 

than 4  4. correspondingly, the irreducible fermion elds are 2-component spinors. the dirac
equation is

where ~ = 0~ and  = 0. the dirac gamma matrices satisfy the anticommutation relations:
{, } = 2g , where we use the minkowski metric g = diag(1,1,1). one natural represen-
tation is a dirac representation:

0

0 = 3 = (cid:18) 1
1 = i1 = (cid:18) 0
2 = i2 = (cid:18) 0

0 1(cid:19)
0(cid:19)
1 0(cid:19)

1

i

i

while a majorana representation (in which  is imaginary while the ~ are real) is:

i

0 = 2 = (cid:18) 0 i
0 (cid:19)
1 = i3 = (cid:18) i
0 i(cid:19)
2 = i1 = (cid:18) 0
0(cid:19)

0

i

i

these 2  2 dirac matrices satisfy the identities:

 = g 1  i
tr() = 2i 

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

note that in familiar 3 + 1 dimensional theories, the trace of an odd number of gamma matrices
vanishes. in 2+1 dimensions , the trace of three gamma matrices produces the totally antisymmetric
 symbol. this fact plays a crucial role in the appearance of induced chern-simons terms in
quantized planar fermion theories, as will be discussed in detail in section 5. another important
novel feature of 2 + 1 dimensions is that there is no 5 matrix that anticommutes with all the
dirac matrices - note that i012 = 1. thus, there is no notion of chirality in the usual sense.

2.4 discrete symmetries: p, c and t
the discrete symmetries of parity, charge conjugation and time reversal act very dierently in
2 + 1-dimensions . our usual notion of a parity transformation is a reection ~x  ~x of the spatial
coordinates. however, in the plane, such a transformation is equivalent to a rotation (this lorentz
transformation has det() = (1)2 = +1 instead of det() = (1)3 = 1). so the improper

12

discrete parity transformation should be taken to be reection in just one of the spatial axes (it
doesnt matter which we choose):

x1  x1
x2  x2

from the kinetic part of the dirac lagrangian we see that the spinor eld  transforms as

  1

(40)

(41)

(where we have suppressed an arbitrary unimportant phase). but this means that a fermion mass
term breaks parity

(42)

(43)

under p, the gauge eld transforms as
a1  a1,

a2  a2,

a0  a0

   

which means that while the standard maxwell kinetic term is p-invariant, the chern-simons term
changes sign under p:
(44)

a a  aa

charge conjugation converts the electron dirac equation (35) into the positron equation:

(i + ea  m) c = 0

(45)

as is standard, this is achieved by the denition c  c0, where the charge conjugation matrix
c must satisfy
(46)

()t = c1c

in the dirac representation (36) we can choose c = 2. note then that the fermion mass term is
invariant under c (recall the anticommuting nature of the fermion elds), as is the chern-simons
term for the gauge eld.
time reversal is an anti-unitary operation (t : i  i) in order to implement x0  x0
without taking p 0  p 0. the action on spinor and gauge elds is [using the dirac representation
(36)]
(47)

a0  a0

from this we see that both the fermion mass term and the gauge eld chern-simons term change
sign under time reversal.

the fact that the fermion mass term and the chern-simons term have the same transformation
properties under the discrete symmetries of p, c and t will be important later in section 5 when
we consider radiative corrections in planar gauge and fermion theories. one way to understand
this connection is that these two terms are supersymmetric partners in 2 + 1 dimensions [13].

2.5 poincare algebra in 2 + 1-dimensions

the novel features of fermion and gauge elds in 2 + 1-dimensions , as well as the anyonic elds,
can be understood better by considering the respresentation theory of the poincare algebra. our
underlying guide is wigners principle: that in quantum mechanics the relativistic single-particle
states should carry a unitary, irreducible representation of the universal covering group of the
poincare group [14].

the poincare group iso(2, 1) combines the proper lorentz group so(2, 1) with space-time
translations [15, 16]. the lorentz generators l and translation generators p  satisfy the standard
poincare algebra commutation relations, which can be re-expressed in 2 + 1-dimensions as

[j , j  ] = ij
[j , p  ] = ip
[p , p  ] = 0

where the pseudovector generator j  is j  = 1
may be characterized by the eigenvalues of the two casimirs:

2 l. irreducible representations of this algrebra

p 2 = pp ,

w = pj 

(48)

here, w is the pauli-lubanski pseudoscalar, the 2 + 1 dimensional analogue of the familiar pauli-
lubanski pseudovector in 3 + 1 dimensions . we dene single-particle representations  by

p 2 = m2

w  = sm

(49)

dening the mass m and spin s.

for example, a spin 0 scalar eld may be represented by a momentum space eld (p) on which

p  acts by multiplication and j  as an orbital angular momentum operator:

p  = p

j  = ip


p 

(50)

then the eigenvalue conditions (49) simply reduce to the klein-gordon equation (p2  m2) = 0
for a spin 0 eld since p  j = 0.

for a two-component spinor eld  we take

j  = ip


p 1 

1
2



(51)

so the eigenvalue conditions (49) become a dirac equation of motion (i  m) = 0, corre-
sponding to spin s =  1
2.
for a vector eld a, whose gauge invariant content may be represented through the pseudovec-
tor dual f  = 1

2 f, we take

(j ) = ip


p  + i



(52)

14

then the eigenvalue condition

(p  j) f  = i

p f  = sm f

(53)

has the form of the topologically massive gauge eld equation of motion (22). we therefore deduce
a mass m = e2 and a spin s = sign() = 1. this agrees with the maxwell-chern-simons mass
found earlier in (23), and is the source of the maxwell-chern-simons spin quoted in (25).
in general, it is possible to modify the standard orbital form of j  appearing in the scalar

eld case (50) without aecting the poincare algebra:

j  = ip



p  s(cid:18) p + m
p   + m(cid:19) ,

 = (1, 0, 0)

(54)

it is easy to see that this gives w = p  j = sm, so that the spin can be arbitrary. this is one way
of understanding the possibility of anyonic spins in 2 + 1 dimensions . actually, the real question
is how this form of j  can be realized in terms of a local equation of motion for a eld. if s is an
integer or a half-integer then this can be achieved with a (2s + 1)-component eld, but for arbitrary
spin s we require innite component elds [17].

2.6 nonabelian chern-simons theories

it is possible to write a nonabelian version of the chern-simons lagrangian (3):

lcs = tr(cid:18)aa +

2
3

aaa(cid:19)

(55)

the gauge eld a takes values in a nite dimensional representation of the (semi-simple) gauge
lie algebra g. in these lectures we take g = su(n ). in an abelian theory, the gauge elds a
commute, and so the trilinear term in (55) vanishes due to the antisymmetry of the  symbol.
t a where the t a are the
in the nonabelian case [just as in yang-mills theory] we write a = aa
generators of g [for a = 1, . . . dim(g)], satisfying the commutation relations [t a, t b] = f abct c, and
the normalization tr(t at b) =  1

2 ab.

exercise 2.6.1 : show that under innitesimal variations a of the gauge eld the change in

the nonabelian chern-simons lagrangian is

where f = a  a + [a, a ] is the nonabelian eld strength.

lcs = tr (af)

(56)

from the variation (56) we see that the nonabelian equations of motion have the same form as
the abelian ones: f = j . note also that the bianchi identity, df = 0, is compatible
with covariant current conservation: dj  = 0. the source-free equations are once again f = 0,
for which the solutions are pure gauges (at connections) a = g1g, with g in the gauge group.

15

an important dierence, however, lies in the behaviour of the nonabelian chern-simons la-
grangian (55) under a gauge transformation. the nonabelian gauge transformation g (which is an
element of the gauge group) tarnsforms the gauge eld as

a  ag

  g1ag + g1g

(57)

exercise 2.6.2 : show that under the gauge transformation (57), the chern-simons lagrangian

lcs in (55) transforms as

lcs  lcs  tr(cid:16) g g1 a(cid:17) 


3

tr(cid:16)g1gg1gg1g(cid:17)

(58)

we recognize, as in the abelian case, a total space-time derivative term, which vanishes in the
action with suitable boundary conditions. however, in the nonabelian case there is a new term in
(58), known as the winding number density of the group element g :

w(g) =

1

242 tr(cid:16)g1gg1 gg1g(cid:17)

(59)

with appropriate boundary conditions, the integral of w(g) is an integer - see exercise 2.6.3. thus,
the chern-simons action changes by an additive constant under a large gauge transformation (i.e.,
one with nontrivial winding number n ):

scs  scs  82n

(60)

this has important implications for the development of a quantum nonabelian chern-simons theory.
to ensure that the quantum amplitude exp(i s) remains gauge invariant, the chern-simons coupling
parameter  must assume discrete values [9]

this is analogous to diracs quantization condition for a magnetic monopole [18]. we shall revisit
this chern-simons discreteness condition in more detail in later sections.

where ~ are the pauli matrices, and r is an arbitrary scale parameter. show that the winding
number for this g is equal to n . why must n be an integer?

16

to conclude this brief review of the properties of nonabelian chern-simons terms, i mention
the original source of the name chern-simons. s. s. chern and j. simons were studying a
combinatorial approach to the pontryagin density tr (f f) in four dimensions and noticed
that it could be written as a total derivative:

tr (f f) = 4 (cid:20)tr(cid:18)aa +

2
3

aa a(cid:19)(cid:21)

(63)

their combinatorial approach got stuck by the emergence of a boundary term which did not yield
to a simple combinatorial analysis. the boundary term seemed interesting in its own right, and it
and its generalizations are the subject of this paper [19]. we recognize this interesting boundary
term as the chern-simons lagrangian (55).

3 canonical quantization of chern-simons theories

there are many ways to discuss the quantization of chern-simons theories. here i focus on canoni-
cal quantization because it has the most direct relationship with the condensed matter applications
which form the primary subject of this school.
indeed, the well-known landau and hofstadter
problems of solid state physics provide crucial physical insight into the canonical quantization of
chern-simons theories.

3.1 canonical structure of chern-simons theories

in this section we consider the classical canonical structure and hamiltonian formulation of chern-
simons theories, in preparation for a discussion of their quantization. we shall discover an extremely
useful quantum mechanical analogy to the classic landau problem of charged electrons moving in
the plane in the presence of an external uniform magnetic eld perpendicular to the plane. i begin
with the abelian theory because it contains the essential physics, and return to the nonabelian case
later.

the hamiltonian formulation of maxwell (or yang-mills) theory is standard. in the weyl gauge
(a0 = 0) the spatial components of the gauge eld ~a are canonically conjugate to the electric eld
components ~e, and gausss law ~  ~e =  appears as a constraint, for which the nondynamical
eld a0 is a lagrange multiplier. [if you wish to remind yourself of the maxwell case, simply set
the chern-simons coupling  to zero in the following equations (64) - (69)].

now consider instead the canonical structure of the maxwell-chern-simons theory with la-

grangian (21):

lmcs =

1
2e2 e2

i 

1
2e2 b2 +


2

ij aiaj + a0b

(64)

the a0 eld is once again nondynamical, and can be regarded as a lagrange multiplier enforcing
the gauss law constraint

if i0 + e2ijiaj = 0

(65)

17

this is simply the  = 0 component of the euler-lagrange equations (22). in the a0 = 0 gauge we
identify the ai as coordinate elds, with corresponding momentum elds

the hamiltonian is obtained from the lagrangian by a legendre transformation

i 

l

=


2

ijaj(cid:19)2

+

1

2e2 b2 + a0(cid:16)ii + b(cid:17)

(66)

(67)

at the classical level, the elds ai(~x, t) and i(~x, t) satisfy canonical equal-time poisson brackets.
these become equal-time canonical commutation relations in the quantum theory:

[ai(~x), j(~y)] = i  j

i (~x  ~y)

(68)

notice that this implies that the electric elds do not commute (for  6= 0)

[ei(~x), ej (~y)] = i e4 ij(~x  ~y)
2e2 ( ~e2 + b2) when expressed in
the hamiltonian (67) still takes the standard maxwell form h = 1
terms of the electric and magnetic elds. this is because the chern-simons term does not modify
the energy  it is, after all, rst order in time derivatives. but it does modify the relation between
momenta and velocity elds. this is already very suggestive of the eect of an external magnetic
eld on the dynamics of a charged particle.

(69)

now consider a pure chern-simons theory, with no maxwell term in the lagrangian.

lcs =


2

ij aiaj + a0b

(70)

once again, a0 is a lagrange multiplier eld, imposing the gauss law: b = 0. but the lagrangian
is rst order in time derivatives, so it is already in the legendre transformed form l = p x h, with
h = 0. so there is no dynamics  indeed, the only dynamics would be inherited from coupling to
dynamical matter elds. another way to see this is to notice that the pure chern-simons energy
momentum tensor

(71)

t  

detg

2

scs
g

vanishes identically because the chern-simons action is independent of the metric, since the la-
grange density is a three-form l = tr(ada + 2
the gauge eld are canonically conjugate to one another:

another important fact about the pure chern-simons system (70) is that the components of

3 aaa).

[ai(~x), aj (~y)] =

i


ij(~x  ~y)

(72)

this is certainly very dierent from the maxwell theory, for which the components of the gauge
eld commute, and it is the ai and ei elds that are canonically conjugate. so pure chern-simons

18

is a strange new type of gauge theory, with the components ai of the gauge eld not commuting
with one another.

we can recover this noncommutativity property from the maxwell-chern-simons case by taking
the limit e2  , with  kept xed. then, from the hamiltonian (67) we see that we are forced
to impose the constraint
(73)

i =

ijaj


2

then the maxwell-chern-simons hamiltonian (67) vanishes and the lagrangian (64) reduces to the
pure chern-simons lagrangian (70). the canonical commutation relations (72) arise because of
the constraints (73), noting that these are second-class constraints so we must use dirac brackets
to nd the canonical relations between ai and aj [23].

3.2 chern-simons quantum mechanics

to understand more deeply this somewhat unusual projection from a maxwell-chern-simons theory
to a pure chern-simons theory we appeal to the following quantum mechanical analogy [24, 23].
consider the long wavelength limit of the maxwell-chern-simons lagrangian, in which we drop all
spatial derivatives. (this is sucient for identifying the masses of excitations.) then the resulting
lagrangian

l =

1
2e2

a2

i +


2

ij aiaj

(74)

has exactly the same form as the lagrangian for a nonrelativistic charged particle moving in the
plane in the presence of a uniform external magnetic eld b perpendicular to the plane

l =

1
2

m x2

i +

b
2

ij xixj

(75)

the canonical analysis of this mechanical model is a simple undergraduate physics exercise. the
momenta

pi =

l

are shifted from the velocities and the hamiltonian is

h = pi xi  l =

1
2m

(pi 

b
2

ijxj)2 =

2

v2
i

(76)

(77)

at the quantum level the canonical commutation relations, [xi, pj] = iij, imply that the velocities
do not commute: [vi, vj] = i b
m2 ij. it is clear that these features of the landau problem mirror
precisely the canonical structure of the maxwell-chern-simons system, for both the hamiltonian
(67) and the canonical commutation relations (68) and (69).

this correspondence is especially useful because the quantization of the landau system is well
understood. the quantum mechanical spectrum consists of equally spaced energy levels (landau
levels), spaced by hc where the cyclotron frequency is c = b
m . see figure 3. each landau level
is innitely degenerate in the open plane, while for a nite area the degeneracy is related to the
net magnetic ux

(78)

where a is the area [20, 21].

figure 3: the energy spectrum for charged particles in a uniform magnetic eld consists of equally
spaced landau levels, separated by hc where c is the cyclotron frequency. each landau level
has degeneracy given by the total magnetic ux through the sample.

the pure chern-simons limit is when e2  , with  xed. in the quantum mechanical case
this corresponds to taking the mass m  0, with b xed. thus, the cyclotron frequency c = b
m
becomes innite and so the energy gap between landau levels becomes innite, isolating each level
from the others. we therefore have a formal projection onto a highly degenerate ground state -
the lowest landau level (lll). interestingly, this is exactly the type of limit that is of physical
interest in quantum hall systems  see steve girvins lectures at this school for more details on
the importance of the lowest landau level. in the limit m  0 of projecting to the lowest landau
level, the lagrangian (75) becomes l = b
2 ij xixj. this is rst order in time derivatives, so the two
coordinates x1 and x2 are in fact canonically conjugate to one another, with commutation relations
[compare with (72)]:

[xi, xj] =

i
b

ij

(79)

thus, the two-dimensional coordinate space has become [in the lll projection limit] a two-
dimensional phase space, with 1
b playing the role of h. applying the bohr-sommerfeld estimate
of the number of quantum states in terms of the area of phase space, we nd

which is precisely landaus estimate (78) of the degeneracy of the lowest landau level.

this projection explains the physical nature of the pure chern-simons theory. the pure chern-
simons theory can be viewed as the e2   limit of the topologically massive maxwell-chern-
simons theory, in which one truncates the hilbert space onto the ground state by isolating it
from the rest of the spectrum by an innite gap. the chern-simons analogue of the cyclotron
frequency c is the chern-simons mass e2. so the inclusion of a chern-simons term in a gauge
theory lagrangian is analogous to the inclusion of a lorentz force term in a mechanical system.
this explains how it was possible to obtain a mass (23) for the gauge eld in the maxwell-chern-
simons theory without the higgs mechanism - in the mechanical analogue, the higgs mechanism
corresponds to introducing a harmonic binding term 1
2 m2~x2, which gives a characteristic frequency
in the most obvious way. but the landau system shows how to obtain a characteristic frequency
(the cyclotron frequency) without introducing a harmonic binding term. we can view the chern-
simons theory as a gauge eld realization of this mechanism.

to clarify the distinction between these two dierent mass generation mechanisms for the gauge
eld, consider them both acting together, as we did in section 2.2. that is, consider the broken
(higgs) phase of a maxwell-chern-simons theory coupled to a scalar eld (27).
if we are only
interested in the masses of the excitations it is sucient to make a zeroth-order (spatial) derivative
expansion, neglecting all spatial derivatives, in which case the functional schrodinger representation
reduces to the familiar schrodinger representation of quantum mechanics. physical masses of the
eld theory appear as physical frequencies of the corresponding quantum mechanical system. in
the higgs phase, the quadratic lagrange density becomes

l =

2e2

a2

i +


2

ij aiaj  v2aiai

(81)

this is the maxwell-chern-simons lagrangian with a proca mass term v2a2
i .
in the analogue
quantum mechanical system this corresponds to a charged particle of mass 1
e2 moving in a uniform
magnetic eld of strength , and a harmonic potential well of frequency  = 2ev. such a quantum
mechanical model is exactly solvable, and is well-known [see exercise 3.2.1] to separate into two
distinct harmonic oscillator systems of characteristic frequencies

 =

c

2  s1 +

42
2

c  1!

(82)

where c is the cyclotron frequency corresponding to the magnetic eld and  is the harmonic
well frequency. taking c = e2 and  = 2ev, we see that these characteristic frequencies are
exactly the mass poles m in (30) of the maxwell-chern-simons higgs system, identied from the
covariant gauge propagator. the pure chern-simons higgs limit corresponds to the physical limit
in which the cyclotron frequency dominates, so that

 

2
c

=

2v2


= m

+  

(83)

the remaining nite frequency  is exactly the mass m found in the covariant propagator (33)
for the higgs phase of a pure chern-simons higgs theory.

21

so we see that in 2 + 1 dimensions , the gauge eld can acquire one massive mode via the
standard higgs mechanism [no chern-simons term], or via the chern-simons-higgs mechanism [no
maxwell term]; or the gauge eld can acquire two massive modes [both chern-simons and maxwell
term].

coherent state measure factor. this explains how the original two-dimensional system reduces to
a one-dimensional system, and how it is possible to have z and z being conjugate to one another,
as required by the commutation relations (79).

hamiltonian as

2m ] satisfy

d+ = 0,

or

4|z|2

(90)

(91)

(92)

we recognize the exponential factor (after absorbing q b

2 into the denition of z as before) as the
factor in (87) which contributes to the coherent state measure factor. thus, the lowest landau
level hilbert space consists of holomorphic wavefunctions f (z), with coherent state norm as dened
in (88) [25]. this is a standard feature of the analysis of the fractional quantum hall eect  see
steve girvins lectures for further applications.

when the original landau hamiltonian contains also a potential term, this leads to interesting
eects under the lll projection. with nite m, a potential v (x1, x2) depends on two commuting
coordinates. but in the lll limit (i.e., m  0 limit) the coordinates become non-commuting [see
(79)] and v (x1, x2) becomes the projected hamiltonian on the projected phase space. clearly, this
leads to possible operator-ordering problems. however, these can be resolved [25, 23] by insisting
that the projected hamiltonian is ordered in such a way that the coherent state matrix elements
computed within the lll agree with the m  0 limit of the matrix elements of the potential,
computed with m nonzero.

3.3 canonical quantization of abelian chern-simons theories

motivated by the coherent state formulation of the lowest landau level projection of the quantum
mechanical systems in the previous section, we now formulate the canonical quantization of abelian
chern-simons theories in terms of functional coherent states. begin with the maxwell-chern-
simons lagrangian in the a0 = 0 gauge:

lmcs =

2e2 (ijiaj)2

(93)

23

this is a quadratic lagrangian, so we expect we can nd the groundstate wavefunctional. physical
states must also satisfy the gauss law constraint: ~  ~  b = 0. this gauss law is satised by
functionals of the form
(94)

[a1, a2] = ei 

where we have decomposed ~a into its longitudinal and transverse parts: ai = i + at
hamiltonian (67), the ground state wavefunctional is [9]

the pure chern-simons limit corresponds to taking e2  , so that the wavefunctional becomes
(96)

where we have dened a = q 
2 (a1 + ia2) [in analogy to the denition of z in the previous section],
and  = (1  i2). from this form of the groundstate wavefunctional we recognize the functional
coherent state measure factor e 1
that depends
only on a, and not on a. this is the functional analogue of the fact that the lll wavefunctions
have the form  = f (z)e 1
, as in (87) and (92). the fact that the chern-simons theory has
a single ground state, rather than a highly degenerate lll, is a consequence of the gauss law
constraint, for which there was no analogue in the quantum mechanical model. these pure chern-
simons wavefunctionals have a functional coherent state inner product [compare with (88)]

actually, we neednt have gone through the process of taking the e2   limit of the maxwell-
chern-simons theory. it is much more direct simply to adopt the functional coherent state picture.
this is like going directly to the lowest landau level using coherent states, instead of projecting
down from the full hilbert space of all the landau levels. the canonical commutation relations (72)
imply [a(z), a(w)] = (z  w), so that we can represent a as a functional derivative operator:
a =  

a . then the pure chern-simons gauss law constraint f12 = 0 acts on states as

if this pure chern-simons theory is coupled to some charged matter elds with a rotationally

where q = r d2x . comparing with the aharonov-bohm exchange phase  = e2

see that the statistics phase s coincides with the spin eigenvalue m . this is the essence of the
generalized spin-statistics relation for extended (eld theoretic) anyons.

3.4 quantization on the torus and magnetic translations

the quantization of pure chern-simons theories on the plane is somewhat boring because there is
just a unique physical state (99). to make this more interesting we could include external sources,
which appear in the canonical formalism as point delta-function sources on the xed-time surface.
the appearance of these singularities makes the projection to at connections satisfying gausss
law more intricate, and leads to important connections with knot theory and the braid group.
alternatively, we could consider the spatial surface to have nontrivial topology, rather than simply
being the open plane r2. for example, take the spatial manifold to be a riemann surface  of genus
g. this introduces extra degrees of freedom, associated with the nontrivial closed loops around the
handles of  [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. interestingly, the quantization of this type of chern-simons theory
reduces once again to an eective quantum mechanics problem, with a new feature that has also
been treated long ago in the solid state literature under the name of the magnetic translation
group.

to begin, it is useful to reconsider the case of r2. to make connection with the coherent
state representation, we express the longitudinal-transverse decomposition of the vector potential,
ai = i + ijj, in terms of the holomorphic elds a = 1
2 (a1  ia2).
thus, with z = x1 + ix2 and aidxi = adz + adz, we have

2 (a1 + ia2) and a = 1

a = z

a = z,

(101)
where  =   i is a complex eld. if  were real, then a would be purely longitudinal - i.e. pure
gauge. but with a complex eld , this representation spans all elds. a gauge transformation is
realized as a shift in the real part of :    + , where  is real.
on a nontrivial surface this type of longitudinal-tranverse decomposition is not sucient, as we
know from elementary vector calculus on surfaces. the gauge eld is decomposed using a hodge
decomposition, which incorporates the windings around the 2g independent noncontractible loops
on . for simplicity, consider the g = 1 case: i.e., the torus. (the generalization to higher genus
is quite straightforward). the torus can be parametrized as a parallelogram with sides 1 and  , as
illustrated in figure 4. the area of the parallelogram is im( ), and the eld a can be expressed as

a = z + i



im( )

(z) a

(102)

where (z) is a holomorphic one-form normalized according tor |(z)|2 = im( ). this holomorphic
form has integrals h  = 1 and h  =  around the homology basis cycles  and . for the torus,

we can simpy take (z) = 1.

the complex parameter a appearing in (102) is just a function of time, independent of the

spatial coordinates. thus the a0 = 0 gauge chern-simons lagrangian decouples into two pieces

lcs =

i2
im( )

( aa  aa) + iz

(z z  z z)

(103)

25

 

1

figure 4: the torus can be parametrized as a parallelogram with sides  and 1. there are two
cycles  and  representing the two independent non-contractible loops on the surface.

so the coherent state wavefunctionals factorize as [a] = [](a), with the  dependence exactly
as discussed in the previous section. on the other hand, the a dependence corresponds exactly to
a quantum mechanical lll problem, with magnetic eld b = 42
im . so the quantum mechanical
wavefunctions (a) have inner product

< | >= z dadae 22

im( )|a|2

((a))(a)

(104)

but we have neglected the issue of gauge invariance. small gauge transformations,    + , do
not aect the a variables. but because of the nontrivial loops on the spatial manifold there are also
large gauge transformations, which only aect the as:

a  a + p + q,

p, q  z

(105)

to understand how these large gauge transformations act on the wavefunctions (a), we recall the
notion of the magnetic translation group. that is, in a uniform magnetic eld, while the magnetic
eld is uniform, the corresponding vector potential, which is what appears in the hamiltonian, is
not! take, for example, ai =  b

2 ijxj. then there are magnetic translation operators

t ( ~r)  ei ~r(~pe ~a)

(106)

which commute with the particle hamiltonian h = 1
another:

2m (~p + e ~a)2, but do not commute with one

t ( ~r1)t ( ~r2) = t ( ~r2)t ( ~r1)eie ~b( ~r1 ~r2)

(107)
the exponential factor here involves the magnetic ux through the parallelogram spanned by ~r1
and ~r2. in solid state applications, a crystal lattice establishes a periodic potential for the electrons.
if, in addition, there is a magnetic eld, then we can ask how the spectrum of landau levels is
modied by the periodic potential, or alternatively we can ask how the bloch band structure of the

26

t
b
a
periodic potential is modied by the presence of the magnetic eld [26]. the important quantity
in answering this question is the magnetic ux through one unit cell of the periodic lattice. it is
known [27, 28] that the magnetic translation group has nite dimensional representations if the
magnetic eld is related to a primitive lattice vector ~e by

~b = 2

1
e

n
m

~e

(108)

where  is the area of the unit cell, and n and m are integers. these representations are constructed
by nding an invariant subgroup of magnetic translation operators; the rationality condition arises
because all members of this invariant subgroup must commute, which places restrictions on the
phase factors in (107). since we are considering a two-dimensional system, with the magnetic eld
perpendicular to the two-dimensional surface, the condition (108) simplies to :

eb
2

=

n
m

(109)

the case m = 1 is special; here the magnetic translations act as one-dimensional ray representa-
tions on the hilbert space, transforming the wavefunction with a phase. consistency of this ray
representation gives the number of states as n = eb
2 , which is just landaus estimate (78) of
the degeneracy of the lll. but when n
m is rational, we still have a consistent nite dimensional
action of the magnetic translation group on the wavefunctions. the invariant subgroup consists of
superlattice translations, where the superlattice is obtained by enlarging each length dimension of
the unit cell by a factor of m . this produces an enlarged unit cell with eective ux m n on which
the magnetic translation group acts one-dimensionally. thus the total dimension is m n . finally,
if n

m is irrational, then the magnetic translation group has innite dimensional representations.
these results can be mapped directly to the quantization of the abelian chern-simons theory on
the torus. the quantum mechanical degrees of freedom, a, have a lll lagrangian with magnetic
eld eb = 42
im . the large gauge transformations (105) are precisely magnetic translations across
a parallelogram unit cell. the area of the unit cell is  = im , the area of the torus. thus

eb
2

=

1

2   42

im ! im = 2

(110)

and the condition for nite dimensional representations of the action of the large gauge transfor-
mations becomes

2 =

n
m

(111)

if we require states to transform as a one-dimensional ray representation under large gauge trans-
formations then we must have 2 = integer. but if 2 is rational, then we still have a perfectly
good quantization, provided we identify the physical states with irreducible representations of the
global gauge transformations (i.e., the magnetic translations). these states transform according to
a nite dimensional irreducible representation of the global gauge transformations, and any element
of a given irreducible representation may be used to evaluate matrix elements of a gauge invariant
operator, because physical gauge invariant operators commute with the generators of large gauge

27

transformations. the dimension of the hilbert space is m n .
if 2 is irrational, there is still
nothing wrong with the chern-simons theory  it simply means that there are an innite number
of states in the hilbert space. these results are consistent with the connection between abelian
chern-simons theories and two dimensional conformal eld theories. chern-simons theories with
rational 2 correspond to what are known as rational cfts, which have a nite number of
conformal blocks, and these conformal blocks are in one-to-one correspondence with the hilbert
space of the chern-simons theory [29, 30, 31, 32].

3.5 canonical quantization of nonabelian chern-simons theories

the canonical quantization of the nonabelian chern-simons theory with lagrangian (55) is similar
in spirit to the abelian case discussed in the previous section. there are, however, some interesting
new features [29, 22, 31, 32, 34]. as before, we specialize to the case where space-time has the form
r  , where  is a torus. with  = t 2, the spatial manifold has two noncontractible loops and
these provide gauge invariant holonomies. the problem reduces to an eective quantum mechanics
problem for these holonomies. just as in the abelian case, it is also possible to treat holonomies due
to sources (which carry a representation of the gauge algebra), and to consider spatial manifolds
with boundaries. these two approaches lead to deep connections with two-dimensional conformal
eld theories, which are beyond the scope of these lectures  the interested reader is referred to
[29, 31, 32, 34] for details.

we begin as in the abelian case by choosing a functional coherent state representation for the
2 (a1 + ia2). the coherent state inner product

holomorphic wavefunctionals  = [a], where a = 1
is

note that with our lie algebra conventions (see section 2.6) tr(aa) =  1
2 aa(aa). physical
states are annihilated by the gauss law generator f12 = 2ifz z. remarkably, we can solve this
constraint explicitly using the properties of the wess-zumino-witten (wzw) functionals:

s[g] =

1

2 z

tr(g1zgg1zg) 

i

12 z(3)

tr(g1gg1 gg1g)

(113)

where in the second term the integral is over a three dimensional manifold with a two dimensional
boundary equal to the two dimensional space .

exercise 3.5.1 : show that the wzw functionals (113) have the fundamental variations

s[g] = (cid:26) 1
 r tr(g1gz(g1zg)]
 1
 r tr(g1gz(g1zg)]

(114)

consider rst of all quantization on the spatial manifold  = r2. to solve the gauss law

constraint we express the holomorphic eld a, using yangs representation [35], as

a = zu u1,

u  gc

(115)

28

< | >= z dadae4r tr(aa)([a])[a]

(112)

this is the nonabelian analogue of the complexied longitudinal-transverse decomposition (101)
a = z for the abelian theory on the plane. u belongs to the complexication of the gauge group,
which, roughly speaking, is the exponentiation of the gauge algebra, with complex parameters.

with a parametrized in this manner, the gauss law constraint fz z = 0 is solved by the

functional

0[a] = e4s[u ]

to verify this, note that the results of exercise 3.5.1 imply that

(116)

(117)

from the canonical commutation relations (72), the eld aa
[a] as a functional derivative operator

0 = 4(cid:20)z tr(a z u u1)(cid:21) 0
2 (aa

z = 1

1iaa

2) acts on a wavefunctional

aa

z =

1
2



aa

thus, acting on the state 0[a] in (116):

z 0[a] = (zu u1)a0[a]
aa

(118)

(119)

since aa

z acts on 0 by multiplication, it immediately follows that fz z0[a] = 0, as required.

the physical state (116) transforms with a cocycle phase factor under a gauge transformation.
we could determine this cocycle from the variation (58) of the nonabelian lagrangian [22]. but a
more direct way here is to use the fundamental polyakov-wiegmann transformation property [36]
of the wzw functionals:

s[g1g2] = s[g1] + s[g2] +

1

 z tr(g1

1 zg1zg2g1
2 )

(120)

with the representation a = zu u1 of the holomorphic eld a, the gauge transformation
a  ag = g1ag + g1zg is implemented by u  g1u , with g in the gauge group. then

0[ag] = e4s[g1u ]

= e4s+[g]4r tr(az gg1)0[a]

(121)

exercise 3.5.2 : check that the transformation law (121) is consistent under composition,
and that it combines properly with the measure factor to make the coherent state inner product
(112) gauge invariant.

furthermore, note that the wzw factors in (116) and (121) are only well dened provided
4 = integer. this is the origin of the discreteness condition (61) on the chern-simons coecient
in canonical quantization.

29

this describes the quantum pure chern-simons theory with spatial manifold being the open
plane r2. there is a unique physical state (116). to make things more interesting we can introduce
sources, boundaries, or handles on the spatial surface. as in the abelian case, here we just consider
the eect of higher genus spatial surfaces, and for simplicity we concentrate on the torus. then the
nonabelian analogue of the abelian hodge decomposition (102) is [31, 32]

a = zu u1 +

i
im

u au1

(122)

where u  gc, and a can be chosen to be in the cartan subalgebra of the gauge lie algebra.
this is the nonabelian generalization of the abelian torus hodge decomposition (102). to motivate
this decomposition, we note that when u  g [not gc!], this is the most general pure gauge (at
connection) on the torus. the a degrees of freedom represent the nontrivial content of a that
cannot be gauged away, due to the noncontractible loops on the spatial manifold. by a gauge
transformation, a can be taken in the cartan subalgebra (indeed, there is further redundancy due
to the action of weyl reections on the cartan subalgebra). then, extending u from g to gc, the
representation (122) spans out to cover all connections, just as in yangs representation (115) on
r2.

combining the representation (122) with the transformation law (121), we see that the physical

state wavefunctionals on the torus are

[a] = e4s[u ]+ 4i

im r tr(au 1z u )(a)

(123)

in the inner product (112), we can change eld variables from a to u and a. but this introduces
nontrivial jacobian factors [31, 32]. the corresponding determinant is another polyakov-weigmann
factor [37], with a coecient c arising from the adjoint representation normalization (c is called
the dual coxeter number of the gauge algebra, and for su (n ) it is n ). the remaining functional
integral over the gauge invariant combination uu may be performed (it is the generating functional
of the gauged wzw model on the torus [37]). the nal result is an eective quantum mechanical
model with coherent state inner product

< | >= z dadae



im (4+c)tr(aa)((a))(a)

(124)

this looks like the abelian case, except for the shift of the chern-simons coecient  by 4 
4+c. in fact, we can represent the quantum mechanical cartan subalgebra degrees of freedom as
r-component vectors ~a, where r is the rank of the gauge algebra. then large gauge transformations
act on these vectors as ~a  ~a + ~m + ~n, where ~m and ~n belong to the root lattice r of the
gauge algebra. the wavefunction with the correct transformation properties under these large
gauge transformation shifts is a generalized theta function, which is labelled by an element ~ of the
weight lattice w of the algebra. these are identied under translations by root vectors, and also
under weyl reections. thus the physical hilbert space of the nonabelian chern-simons theory on
the torus corresponds to

w

w  (4 + c)r

30

this parametrization of states is a familiar construction in the theory of kac-moody algebras and
conformal eld theories.

(125)

3.6 chern-simons theories with boundary

we conclude this review of basic facts about the canonical structure of chern-simons theories by
commenting briey on the manifestation of boundary degrees of freedom in chern-simons theories
dened on spatial manifolds which have a boundary. we have seen in the previous sections that the
canonical quantization of pure chern-simons theory on the space-time r, where  is a compact
riemann surface, leads to a hilbert space that is in one-to-one correspondence with the conformal
blocks of a conformal eld theory dened on . but there is another important connection between
chern-simons theories and cft  namely, if the spatial manifold  has a boundary , then the
hilbert space of the chern-simons theory is innite dimensional, and provides a representation of
the chiral current algebra of the cft dened on   r [29, 31, 32].
the source of these boundary eects is the fact that when we checked the variation of the
chern-simons action in (56) we dropped a surface term. retaining the surface term, the variation
of the chern-simons action splits naturally into a bulk and a surface piece [29, 32]:

scs = z d3xtr(af) + z d3x [tr(aa)]

(126)

the boundary conditions must be such that rbndy tr(a a) = 0. when it is the spatial manifold 

that has a boundary , we can impose the boundary condition that a0 = 0. the remaining local
symmetry corresponds to gauge transformations that reduce to the identity on , while the time
independent gauge transformations on the boundary are global gauge transformations.

with this boundary condition we can write

scs = zr

d3x ijtr(ai aj) + zr

d3x ijtr(a0fij)

(127)

variation with respect to the lagrange multiplier eld a0 imposes the constraint fij = 0, which
has as its solution the pure gauges ai = g1ig. then it follows that the chern-simons action
becomes

s = zr

d dt tr(g1gg10g) +



3 zr

tr(cid:16)g1gg1 gg1g(cid:17)

(128)

this is the chiral wzw action. the quantization of this system leads to a chiral current algerba
of the gauge group, with the boundary values of the gauge eld a = g1g being identied with
the chiral kac-moody currents. this relation gives another important connection between chern-
simons theories (here, dened on a manifold with a spatial boundary) and conformal eld theories
[29, 32].

boundary eects also play an important role in the theory of the quantum hall eect [38, 39],
where there are gapless edge excitations which are crucial for explaining the conduction properties
of a quantum hall liquid. consider the variation of the abelian chern-simons action

(cid:18)z d3xaa(cid:19) = 2z d3xaa +z d3x (aa)

(129)

31

for an innitesimal gauge variation, a = , this becomes a purely surface term

(cid:18)z d3xaa(cid:19) = z d3x (a)

for a space-time d  r, where d is a disc with boundary s1

(cid:18)z d3xaa(cid:19) = zs1r

(0a  a0)

(130)

(131)

thus, the chern-simons action is not gauge invariant. another way to say this is that the current
j  = scs
2 f is conserved within the bulk, but not on the boundary. for a disc-like
a
spatial surface, this noninvariance leads to an accumulation of charge density at the boundary at
a rate given by the radial current :

= 

jr = e

(132)

where e is the tangential electric eld at the boundary. however, we recognize this noninvariance
as exactly that of a 1 + 1 dimensional weyl fermion theory dened on the boundary s1  r. due
to the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral anomaly, an electric eld (which must of course point along the
boundary) leads to the anomalous creation of charge at the rate (with n avours of fermions) :


t

q =

n
2

e

(133)

therefore, when 2 is an integer [recall the abelian discreteness condition (111)] the noninvariance
of the chern-simons theory matches precisely the noninvariance of the anomalous boundary chiral
fermion theory. this corresponds to a ow of charge from the bulk to the edge and vice versa.
this gives a beautiful picture of a quantum hall droplet, with integer lling fraction, as an actual
physical realization of the chiral anomaly phenomenon. indeed, when 2 = n, we can view the
hall droplet as an actual coordinate space realization of the dirac sea of the edge fermions [40].
this also provides a simple eective description of the integer quantum hall eect as a quantized
ow of charge onto the edge of the hall droplet. for the fractional quantum hall eect we need
more sophisticated treatments on the edge, such as bosonization of the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral
fermion edge theory in terms of chiral boson elds [38], or representations of w1+, the quantum
algebra of area preserving dieomorphisms associated with the incompressibility of the quantum
hall droplet [41].

4 chern-simons vortices

chern-simons models acquire dynamics via coupling to other elds. in this section we consider the
dynamical consequences of coupling chern-simons elds to scalar elds that have either relativistic
or nonrelativistic dynamics. these theories have vortex solutions, similar to (in some respects)
but dierent from (in other respects) familiar vortex models such as arise in landau-ginzburg
theory or the abelian higgs model. the notion of bogomolnyi self-duality is ubiquitous, with
some interesting new features owing to the chern-simons charge-ux relation  = b.

32

4.1 abelian-higgs model and abrikosov-nielsen-olesen vortices

i begin by reviewing briey the abelian-higgs model in 2 + 1 dimensions . this model describes
a charged scalar eld interacting with a u (1) gauge eld, and exhibits vortex solutions carrying
magnetic ux, but no electric charge. these vortex solutions are important in the landau-ginzburg
theory of superconductivity because the static energy functional [see (135) below] for the relativistic
abelian-higgs model coincides with the nonrelativistic landau-ginzburg free energy in the theory
of type ii superconductors, for which vortex solutions were rst studied by abrikosov [42].

consider the abelian-higgs lagrangian [43]

lah = 

1
4

f f  + |d|2 



4 (cid:16)||2  v2(cid:17)2

(134)

where the covariant derivative is d =  + iea, and the quartic potential has the standard
symmetry breaking form as shown in figure 5.

figure 5: the self-dual quartic potential 
manifold is || = v.

4 (cid:0)||2  v2(cid:1)2 for the abelian-higgs model. the vacuum

the static energy functional of the abelian-higgs model is

eah = z d2x(cid:20) 1

2

b2 + | ~d|2 +



4 (cid:16)||2  v2(cid:17)2(cid:21)

(135)

where b = f12. the potential minimum has constant solutions  = eiv, where  is a real phase.
thus the vacuum manifold is isomorphic to the circle s1. furthermore, any nite energy solution
must have (~x) tending to an element of this vacuum manifold at innity. therefore, nite energy
solutions are classied by their winding number or vorticity n , which counts the number of times
the phase of  winds around the circle at spatial innity:

(~x)||~x|= = v ein 

(136)

the vorticity is also related to the magnetic ux because nite energy solutions also require

| ~d|  0 as |~x|  . this implies that

eai  ii ln   n i

as

|~x|  

(137)

33

therefore, the dimensionless magnetic ux is

 = ez d2xb = ei|~x|=

aidxi = 2n

(138)

a brute-force approach to vortex solutions would be to make, for example in the 1-vortex case,

a radial ansatz:

(~x) = f (r)ei,

~a(~x) = a(r)

(139)

the eld equations then reduce to coupled nonlinear ordinary dierential equations for f (r) and
a(r). one can seek numerical solutions with the appropriate boundary conditions: f (r)  v and
a(r)  1
er as r  ; and f (r)  0 and a(r)  0 as r  0. no exact solutions are known,
but approximate solutions can be found numerically. the solutions are localized vortices in the
sense that the elds approach their asymptotic vacuum values exponentially, with characteristic
decay lengths set by the mass scales of the theory. note that , e2 and v2 each has dimensions of
mass; and the lagrangian (134) has a higgs phase with a massive gauge eld of mass mg = 2ev,
together with a massive real scalar eld of mass ms = v.
in general, these two mass scales
are independent, but the abelian-higgs model displays very dierent behavior depending on the
relative magnitude of these two mass scales. numerically, it has been shown that two vortices (or
two antivortices) repel if ms > mg, but attract if ms < mg. when the masses are equal

ms = mg

(140)

then the forces betwen vortices vanish and it is possible to nd stable static multivortex congura-
tions. when translated back into the landau-ginzburg model for superconductivity, this critical
point, ms = mg, corresponds to the boundary between type-i and type-ii superconductivity. in
terms of the abelian-higgs model (134), this critical point is known as the bogomolnyi [44] self-dual
point where

 = 2e2

(141)

with this relation between the charge e and the potential strength , special things happen.

to proceed, we need a fundamental identity  one that will appear many times throughout our

study of vortex solutions in planar gauge theories.

| ~d|2 = |(d1  id2)|2  eb||2  ijijj

(142)

where jj = 1

2i [dj  (dj )]. using this identity, the energy functional (135) becomes [44]

eah = z d2x" 1

2 (cid:16)b  e(||2  v2)(cid:17)2

+ |d|2 + (


4

 ev2b#

(143)

where d  (d1  id2), and we have dropped a surface term. at the self-dual point (141) the
potential terms cancel, and we see that the energy is bounded below by a multiple of the magnitude
of the magnetic ux (for positive ux we choose the lower signs, and for negative ux we choose
the upper signs):

eah  v2||

34

(144)

this bound is saturated by elds satisfying the rst-order bogomolnyi self-duality equations [44]:

d = 0

b = e(||2  v2)

(145)

the self-dual point (141) is also the point at which the 2 + 1 dimensional abelian-higgs model
(134) can be extended to an n = 2 supersymmetric (susy) model [45, 46]. that is, rst construct
an n = 1 susy lagrangian of which (134) is the bosonic part. this susy can then be extended
to n = 2 susy only when the  potential is of the form in (134) and the self-duality condition
(141) is satised. this is clearly related to the mass degeneracy condition (140) because for n = 2
susy we need pairs of bosonic particles with equal masses (in fact, the extension to n = 2 susy
requires an additional neutral scalar eld to pair with the gauge eld a). this feature of n = 2
susy corresponding to the self-dual point is a generic property of self-dual models [47, 48], and
we will see it again in our study of chern-simons vortices.

the self-duality equations (145) are not solvable, or even integrable, but a great deal is known
about the solutions. to bring them to a more manageable form, we decompose the scalar eld 
into its phase and magnitude:

 = ei 

1
2

then the rst of the self-duality equations (145) determines the gauge eld

eai = i 

1
2

ijj ln 

everywhere away from the zeros of the scalar eld. the second self-duality equation in (145) then
reduces to a nonlinear elliptic equation for the scalar eld density :

(146)

(147)

(148)

2 ln  = 2e2(cid:16)  v2(cid:17)

no exact solutions are known for this equation, even when reduced to an ordinary dierential
equation by the condition of radial symmetry. however, it is easy to nd (numerically) vortex-like
solutions with  = f (r)ein  where f (r) satises

(149)

many interesting theorems have been proved concerning the general solutions to the self-dual
abelian-higgs equations (145). these are paraphrased below. readers interested in all the ne-
print should consult [49] and the original papers.

existence and uniqueness: let (, ~a) be a smooth nite energy solution to the abelian-higgs

self-duality equations (145). then

(i)  has a nite number of zeros z1, . . . , zm;
(ii) around each zero,   (z  zk)nk hk(z), where hk(z) is smooth and hk(zk) 6= 0;
(iii) the vorticity is given by the net multiplicity of zeros: n = pm
(iv) given any set of zeros, z1, . . ., zm, the solution is unique, up to gauge equivalence;

k=1 nk;

35

(v) || < v on r2.
furthermore, it has been shown that all nite energy solutions to the full second-order static
equations of motion are solutions to the rst-order self-duality equations. thus, the solutions
described in the above theorem cover all nite energy static solutions.

these results mean that the moduli space of static multivortex solutions is 2n dimensional,
and these 2n parameters can be associated with the locations of the zeros of the higgs eld .
this counting is conrmed by an index-theorem uctuation analysis [50]. we shall return to this
moduli space later in section 4.7 when we discuss the dynamics of vortices.

to conclude this review of the abelian-higgs model i mention that this model has also been
studied on spatial manifolds that are compact riemann surfaces. this is of interest for making
comparisons with numerical simulations, which are necessarily nite, and also for studying the
thermodynamics of vortices [51]. the main new feature is that there is an upper limit, known as
bradlows bound [52], on the vorticity for a given area of the surface. the appearance of such a
bound is easy to see by integrating the second of the self-duality equations (145) over the surface
(assuming positive ux, we take the lower signs):

z d2xeb = e2v2z d2x  e2z d2x||2
since r d2xeb = 2n , and r d2x||2 is positive, this implies that

area

e2v2
2

n 

(150)

(151)

[in the mathematics literature v2 and  are usually scaled to 1, so that the self-dual value of e2
is 1
2 , in which case the bound reads: 4n  area.] a similar bound applies when considering the
abelian-higgs vortex solutions with periodic t hooft boundary conditions dened on a unit cell of
nite area [53].

4.2 relativistic chern-simons vortices

a natural generalization of the abelian-higgs model of the previous section is to consider the eect
of taking the gauge eld to be governed by a chern-simons lagrangian rather than a maxwell
lagrangian. the name relativistic chern-simons vortices comes from the fact that a chern-
simons gauge eld inherits its dynamics from the matter elds to which it is coupled, and here it is
coupled to a relativistic scalar eld  later we shall consider vortices arising from a chern-simons
gauge eld coupled to matter elds with nonrelativistic dynamics. numerous studies were made
of vortex solutions in models with chern-simons and/or maxwell terms, with symmetry breaking
scalar eld potentials [54, 55]. however, no analogue of the bogomolnyi self-dual structure of the
abelian-higgs model was found until a particular sixth-order scalar potential was chosen in a model
with a pure chern-simons term [56, 57].

consider the lagrangian

lrcs =


2

aa + |d|2  v (||)

(152)

36

where v (||) is the scalar eld potential, to be specied below. the associated energy functional is

ercs =z d2xh|d0|2 + | ~d|2 + v (||)i

(153)

before looking for self-dual vortices we note a fundamental dierence between vortices in a chern-
simons model and those in the abelian-higgs model, where the gauge eld is governed by a maxwell
term. the abelian-higgs vortices carry magnetic ux but are electrically neutral. in contrast, in
a chern-simons model the chern-simons gauss law constraint relates the magnetic eld b to the
conserved u (1) charge density as

b =

1


j0 =

i


(d0  (d0))

thus, if there is magnetic ux there is also electric charge:

q = z d2xj 0 = z d2xb = 

(154)

(155)

so solutions of vorticity n necessarily carry both magnetic ux  and electric charge q. they are
therefore excellent candidates for anyons.

to uncover the bogomolnyi-style self-duality, we use the factorization identity (142), together

with the chern-simons gauss law constraint (154), to express the energy functional as

ercs = z d2x(cid:20)|d0 

i


(||2  v2)|2 + |d|2 + v (||) 

1

2||2(||2  v2)2  v2b(cid:21)

(156)

thus, if the potential is chosen to take the self-dual form

v (||) =

1
2||2(||2  v2)2

then the energy is bounded below [choosing signs depending on the sign of the ux]

ercs  v2||

the bound (158) is saturated by solutions to the rst-order equations

d = 0,

d0 = 

i


(||2  v2)

(157)

(158)

(159)

which, when combined with the gauss law constraint (154), become the self-duality equations:

d = 0
b = 

2
2||2(||2  v2)

(160)

these are clearly very similar to the self-duality equations (145) obtained in the abelian-higgs
model. however, there are some signicant dierences. before discussing the properties of solutions,

37

figure 6: the self-dual potential 1
note the existence of two degenerate vacua:  = 0 and || = v.

2||2(||2v2)2 for the relativistic self-dual chern-simons system.

a few comments are in order. first, as is illustrated in figure 6, the self-dual potential (157) is
sixth-order, rather than the more commonly considered case of fourth-order.

such a potential is still power-counting renormalizable in 2 + 1 dimensions. furthermore, the
potential is such that the minima at  = 0 and at ||2 = v2 are degenerate. correspondingly,
there are domain wall solutions that interpolate between the two vacua [58]. in the higgs vacuum,
the chern-simons-higgs mechanism leads to a massive gauge eld [recall (33)] and a massive real
scalar eld. with the particular form of the self-dual potential (157) these masses are equal:

ms =

2v2


= mg

(161)

just as in the abelian-higgs case, the relativistic chern-simons vortex model has an associated
n = 2 susy, in the sense that the lagrangian (152), with scalar potential (157), is the bosonic
part of a susy model with extended n = 2 susy [59].

exercise 4.2.1 : the n = 2 susy extension of the relativistic chern-simons vortex system

(152) has lagrangian

lsusy =


2

aa + |d|2 + i d/ 

1
2||2(||2  v2)2 +

1


(3||2  v2) 

(162)

show that there are pairs of bosonic elds degenerate with pairs of fermionic elds, in both the
symmetric and asymmetric phases.

to investigate vortex solutions, we decompose the scalar eld  into its magnitude  and
phase  as in (146). the gauge eld is once again determined by the rst self-duality equation
to be ai = i  1
2 ijj ln , as in (147), away from the zeros of the scalar eld. the second
self-duality equation then reduces to a nonlinear elliptic equation:

2 ln||2 =

4
2||2(||2  v2)

38

(163)

just as in the abelian-higgs case (148), this equation is neither solvable nor integrable. however,
numerical solutions can be found using a radial vortex-like ansatz. a signicant dierence from the
abelian-higgs case is that while the abelian-higgs vortices have magnetic ux strings located at
the zeros of the scalar eld , in the chern-simons case we see from (160) that the magnetic eld
vanishes at the zeros of . the magnetic eld actually forms rings centred on the zeros of .

numerical studies lead to two dierent types of solutions, distinguished by their behaviour at

spatial innity:

1. topological solutions: ||  v as |~x|  .
2. nontopological solutions: ||  0 as |~x|  .
in case 1, the solutions are topologically stable because they interpolate between the unbroken
vacuum  = 0 at the origin and the broken vacuum || = v at innity. for these solutions, existence
has been proven using similar complex analytic and variational techniques to those used for the
ablian-higgs model [60].

existence: there exist smooth nite energy solutions (, ~a) to the relativistic chern-simons

self-duality equations (160) such that

(i) ||  v as |~x|  ;
(ii)  has a nite number of zeros z1, . . ., zm;
(iii) around each zero,   (z  zk)nkhk(z), where hk(z) is smooth and hk(zk) 6= 0;
(iv) the vorticity is given by the net multiplicity of zeros: n = pm

k=1 nk.

interestingly, the uniqueness of these solutions has not been rigorously proved. nor has the
equivalence of these self-dual solutions to all nite energy solutions of the full second-order equations
of motion.

the topological vortex solutions have ux, charge, energy:

 = 2n,

q = ,

e = v2||

(164)

furthermore, they have nonzero angular momentum. for n superimposed vortices, the angular
momentum can be evaluated as

j = n 2 = 

q2
4

j = (n 2  2) = 

39

q
42 + n q

which is the anyonic relation (20).

the nontopological solutions, with asymptotic behaviour ||  0 as |~x|  , are more com-
plicated. the only existence proof so far is for superimposed solutions [61]. however, numerical
studies are quite convincing, and show that [58]

 = 2(n + ),

q = ,

e = v2||

(166)

where  is a continuous parameter. they have nonzero angular momentum, and for n superimposed
vortices

(165)

(167)

there is an analogue of bradlows bound (151) for the relativistic chern-simons vortices. inte-

grating the second self-duality equation in (160), we get

z d2xb =

v4

22 z d2x 

2

2 z d2x ||2 

v2

2 !2

which implies that the vorticity is bounded above by

v4
42 area

n 

(168)

(169)

a related bound has been found in the study of periodic solutions to the relativistic chern-simons
equations [62, 64].

exercise 4.2.2 : the self-dual model (152) may be generalized to include also a maxwell term

for the gauge eld, but this requires an additional neutral scalar eld n [45]:

1

show that in the symmetric phase the neutral scalar eld n is degenerate with the massive gauge
eld. show that in the asymmetric phase the n eld and the real part of  have masses equal to
the two masses of the gauge eld. check that

(i) the limit e2   reduces to the relativistic chern-simons vortex model of (152)
(ii) the limit   0 reduces to the abelian-higgs model (134).

4.3 nonabelian relativistic chern-simons vortices

the self-dual chern-simons vortex systems studied in the previous section can be generalized to
incorporate nonabelian local gauge symmetry [65, 66]. this can be done with the matter elds and
gauge elds in dierent representations, but the most natural and interesting case seems to be with
adjoint coupling, with the matter elds and gauge elds in the same lie algebra representation.
then the gauge covariant derivative is d =  + [a, ] and the lagrangian is

l = tr(cid:18)a a +

2
3

aaa(cid:19) + tr(cid:16)|d|2(cid:17) 

1

42 tr(cid:16)|[[, ], ]  v2|2(cid:17)

(172)

where we have used the short-hand notation |d|2 = (d)d. there is a nonabelian version
of the factorization identity (142) which with adjoint coupling reads

tr(cid:16)| ~d|2(cid:17) = tr(cid:16)|d|2(cid:17)  i tr(cid:16)[f12, ](cid:17)  iji tr(cid:16)dj  (dj)(cid:17)

(173)

40

by the same argument as in the abelian case, we can show that with the potential as in (172),
the associated energy functional is bounded below by an abelian magnetic ux. this bogomolnyi
bound is saturated by solutions to the nonabelian self-duality equations

d = 0
1
2 [v2  [[, ], ], ]
f+ =

(174)

once again, the self-dual point is the point at which the model becomes the bosonic part of an
n = 2 susy model. the self-dual potential has an intricate pattern of degenerate minima, given
by solutions of the embedding equation

[[, ], ] = v2

(175)

this equation describes the embedding of su (2) into the gauge lie algebra, as can be seen by
making the identications:

 =

1
v

j+;

 =

1
v

j;

[, ] =

1
v

[j+, j] =

1
v

j3

(176)

in which case the vacuum condition (175) reduces to the standard su (2) commutation relations.
therefore, for su (n ), the number of gauge inequivalent vacua is given by the number of inequiv-
alent ways of embedding su (2) into su (n ). this number is in fact equal to the number p (n ) of
partitions of the integer n . in each of these vacua, the masses of the gauge and scalar elds pair
up in degenerate pairs, reecting the n = 2 susy of the extended model including fermions. the
masses are given by universal formulae in terms of the exponents of the gauge algebra [66].

not many rigorous mathematical results are known concerning solutions to the nonabelian
self-duality equations, although partial results have been found [63]. physically, we expect many
dierent classes of solutions, with asymptotic behaviour of the solutions corresponding to the various
gauge inequivalent vacua.

4.4 nonrelativistic chern-simons vortices : jackiw-pi model

as mentioned before, chern-simons gauge elds acquire their dynamics from the matter elds
to which they couple, and so they can be coupled to either relativistic or nonrelativistic matter
elds. the nonrelativistic couplings discussed in this and subsequent sections are presumably more
immediately relevant for applications in condensed matter systems. we shall see that bogomolnyi
self-duality is still realizable in the nonrelativistic systems.

we begin with the abelian jackiw-pi model [67]

(178)

where j   (, ~j ) is a lorentz covariant short-hand notation for the conserved nonrelativistic
2m (cid:16)dj (cid:0)dj(cid:1) (cid:17). this system is
charge and current densities:  = ||2, and j j =  i
galilean invariant, and there are corresponding conserved quantities: energy, momentum, angular
momentum and galilean boost generators. there is, in fact, an addition dynamical symmetry [67]
involving dilations, with generator

and special conformal transformations, with generator

d = te

ejp = z d2x(cid:20) 1

2m|d|2 (cid:18) g

thus, with the self-dual coupling

(182)

(183)

the energy is bounded below by zero, and this lower bound is saturated by solutions to the rst-order
self-duality equations

d = 0

note that with the self-dual coupling (183), the original quartic interaction term,  g
2||4 =
 1
2m||4, can be understood as a pauli interaction term  b
2m||2, owing to the chern-simons
constraint ||2 = b.
the self-duality equations (184) can be disentangled as before, by decomposing the scalar eld
 into a phase and a magnitude (146), resulting in a nonlinear elliptic equation for the density :

2 ln  = 

2




42

(185)

surprisingly [unlike the previous nonlinear elliptic equations (148,163) in the abelian-higgs and
relativistic chern-simons vortex models], this elliptic equation is exactly solvable! it is known as
the liouville equation [68], and has the general real solution

where f = f (z) is a holomorphic function of z = x1 + ix2 only.

 = 2 ln(cid:16)1 + |f|2(cid:17)

(186)

exercise 4.4.1 : verify that the density  in (186) satises the liouville equation (185). show
that only one sign is allowed for physical solutions, and show that this corresponds to an attractive
quartic potential in the original lagrangian (177).

as a consequence of the chern-simons gauss law, these vortices carry both magnetic and

electric charge: q = . the net matter charge q is

q = z d2x2 ln(cid:16)1 + |f|2(cid:17) = 2(cid:20)r

as r  0, the charge density behaves as   r2(n1), while as r  ,   r22n . at
xj
the origin, the vector potential behaves as ai(r)  i  (n  1)ij
r2 . we can therefore avoid
singularities in the the vector potential at the origin if we choose the phase of  to be  = (n1).
thus the self-dual  eld is

requiring that  be single-valued we nd that n must be an integer, and for  to decay at innity
we require that n be positive. for n > 1 the  solution has vorticity n  1 at the origin and  goes
to zero at the origin. see figure 7 for a plot of the density for the n = 2 case. note the ring-like
form of the magnetic eld for these chern-simons vortices, as the magnetic eld is proportional to
 and so b vanishes where the eld  does.

for the radial solution (188) the net matter charge is q = r d2x  = 4n ; and the correspond-

ing ux is  = 4n , which represents an even number of ux units. this quantized character of
the ux is a general feature and is not particular to the radially symmetric solutions.

the radial solution (188) arose from choosing the holomorphic function f (z) = ( z0

z )n , and
corresponds to n vortices superimposed at the origin. a solution corresponding to n separated
vortices may be obtained by taking

f (z) =

n

xa=1

ca

z  za

(190)

figure 8: density  for a solution (190) representing two separated vortices.

there are 4n real parameters involved in this solution : 2n real parameters za (a = 1, . . . n )
describing the locations of the vortices, and 2n real parameters ca (a = 1, . . . n ) corresponding to
the scale and phase of each vortex. see figure 8 for a plot of the two vortex case. the solution in

44

(190) is in fact the most general nite multi-soliton solution on the plane. solutions with a periodic
matter density  may be obtained by choosing the function f in (186) to be a doubly periodic
function [69].

i conclude this section by noting that the dynamical symmetry of the jackiw-pi system guar-
antees that static solutions are necessarily self-dual. this follows from the generators (179) and
(180). consider the dilation generator d in (179). it is conserved, but so is ~p for static solutions.
this implies that e must vanish, which is only true for self-dual solutions.

4.5 nonabelian nonrelativistic chern-simons vortices

just as the relativistic chern-simons vortices of section 4.2 could be generalized to incorporate
local nonabelian gauge symmetry, so too can the nonrelativistic models discussed in the previous
section. we consider the case of adjoint coupling, with lagrangian

l = tr(cid:18)a a +
tr(cid:16)[, ]2(cid:17) (191)
using the nonabelian factorization identity (173), together with the gauss law constraint, f+ =
1
 [, ], the static energy functional can be written as

aa a(cid:19) + i tr(cid:16)d0(cid:17)

which is clearly bounded below by 0. the solutions saturating this lower bound satisfy the rst-
order self-duality equations

d = 0
1
f+ =


[, ]

(193)

these self-duality equations have been studied before in a dierent context, as they are the dimen-
sional reduction of the four-dimensional self-dual yang-mills equations

f  =

2

f

(194)

exercise 4.5.1 : show that the self-dual yang-mills equations, with signature (2, 2), reduce to
the self-dual chern-simons equations (193) if we take elds independent of two of the coordinates,
say x3 and x4, and combine the gauge elds a3 and a4 to form the elds  and .

the self-duality equations (193) are integrable, as they can be expressed as a zero curvature

condition in the following way. dene a spectral connection [with spectral paramter ]

a+ = a+  r 1

a = a +

(196)

therefore, the condition of zero curvature, f+ = 0, for arbitrary spectral parameter , encodes the
self-dual chern-simons equations (193). explicit exact solutions can also be obtained by making
simplifying algebraic ansatze which reduce the self-duality equations to the toda equations, which
are coupled analogues of the liouville equation (185) and which are still integrable [70, 71].

in fact, all nite charge solutions can be found by mapping the self-duality equations (193) into
the chiral model equations, which can then be integrated exactly in terms of unitons. to see this,
set the spectral parameter  = 1 in (195) and use the zero curvature f+ = 0 to dene

a = g1g

where p is a holomorphic projector satisfying: (i) p = p, (ii) p2 = p, and (iii) (1  p)+p = 0. this
means that all nite charge solutions of the self-dual chern-simons vortex equations (193) can be
constructed in terms of unitons [66].

where m = m (x) is any rectangular matrix. for su (2) show that the uniton solution leads to a

matrix 3.

4.6 vortices in the zhang-hansson-kivelson model for fqhe

there have been many applications of chern-simons theories to the description of the quantum
hall eect, and the fractional quantum hall eect in particular (see e.g. [74, 38, 7, 39, 8]). in this
section i describe one such model, and show how it is related to our discussion of chern-simons
vortices.

46

zhang, hansson and kivelson [5] reformulated the problem of interacting fermions in an external
magnetic eld as a problem of interacting bosons with an extra chern-simons interaction describing
the statistical transmutation of the fermions into bosons. this transmutation requires a particular
choice for the chern-simons coupling constant, as we shall see below. the chern-simons coupling
is such that an odd number of ux quanta are tied to the fermions [recall figure 1]; thus the
fermions acquire an additional statistics parameter [given by (20)] and so become eective bosons.
the zhk model is basically a landau-ginzburg eective eld theory description of these boson
elds, coupled to a chern-simons eld that takes care of the statistical transmutation. it looks like
a fairly innocent variation on the jackiw-pi model of section 4.4, but the minor change makes a
big dierence to the vortex solutions. the zhk lagrangian is

where we have adopted the notation that the statistical chern-simons gauge eld is a, while the
external gauge eld descrbing the external magnetic eld is aext
. we have also, for convenience
in some of the subsequent equations, written the chern-simons coupling as . the constant n
appearing in the potential term denotes a uniform condensate charge density.
normally a complex scalar eld  is used to describe bosons. but when the chern-simons

coupling takes the values

2(2k  1)
the anyonic statistics phase (20) of the  elds is 1
2 = (2k1); that is, the elds are antisymmetric
under interchange. thus the elds are actually fermionic. we can alternatively view this as the
condensing of the fundamental fermionic elds into bosons by the attachment of an odd number of
uxes through the chern-simons coupling [5]. consider a delta-function contact interaction with

with the values of  in (202), these are exactly the conditions for the uniform laughlin states of

in the last step we have chosen the lower sign, and used the relation n = bext to cancel the

the chern-simons magnetic eld.

thus, the energy is bounded below by a multiple of the total magnetic ux. this bound is

saturated by solutions to the rst-order equations

comparing this with the corresponding equation (185) in the jackiw-pi model, we see that the eect
of the external eld and the modied potential (204) is to include a constant term on the rhs.
but this converts the liouville equation back into the vortex equation (148) for the abelian-higgs
model! this can be viewed as both good and bad news  bad in the sense that we no longer have
the explicit exact solutions to the liouville equation (185) that we had in the jackiw-pi model,
but good because we know a great deal about the abelian-higgs models vortices, even though
we do not have any explicit exact solutions. first, we learn that there are indeed well-behaved
vortex solutions in the zhk model, and that their magnetic charge is related to their vorticity. but
now, because of the chern-simons relation, these vortices also have electric charge, proportional
to their magnetic charge. in particular these vortices have the correct quantum numbers for the
quasi-particles in the laughlin model for the fqhe [5].

4.7 vortex dynamics

so far, we have only dealt with static properties of vortices in various 2 + 1-dimensional eld
theories. however, the more interesting question concerns their dynamics; and beyond that, we are
ultimately interested in their quantization. various dierent approaches have been developed over
the years for studying vortex dynamics. particle physicists and eld theorists, motivated largely
by mantons work [76] on the low energy dynamics of solitons (of which these planar bogomolnyi
vortices are an example), have studied the dynamics of vortices in the abelian-higgs model, which is
governed by relativistic dynamics for the scalar eld. condensed matter physicists have developed
techniques for studying vortices in superconductors and in helium systems, where the dynamics is
nonrelativistic [77]. the chern-simons vortices are particularly interesting, because in addition to
introducing the new feature of anyon statistics of vortices, they appear to require methods from
both the particle physics and condensed matter physics approaches. having said that, there is, as
yet, no clear and detailed understanding of the dynamics of chern-simons vortices. this is a major
unsolved problem in the eld.

consider rst of all the dynamics of vortices in the abelian-higgs model of section 4.1. since
no exact vortex solutions are known, even for the static case, we must be content with approximate
analytic work and/or numerical simulations. as mentioned earlier, it is known from numerical work
[78] that the vortices in the abelian-higgs model repel one another when the scalar mass exceeds
the gauge mass, and attract when the gauge mass exceeds the scalar mass. when these two mass
scales are equal (140) we are in the self-dual case, and there are no forces between static vortices.
mantons approach to the dynamics of solitons provides an eective description of the dynamics
at low energies when most of the eld theoretic degrees of freedom are frozen out. suppose we
have static multi-soliton solutions parametrized by a nite dimensional moduli space  the space
consisting of the minima of the static energy functional (135). we assume that the true dynamics
of the full eld theory is in some sense close to this moduli space of static solutions. then the
full dynamics should be approximated well by a projection onto a nite dimensional problem of
dynamics on the moduli space. this is an adiabatic approximation in which one assumes that at
each moment of time the eld is a static solution, but that the parameters of the static solution
[in the vortex case we can loosely think of these parameters as the locations of the vortices] vary
slowly with time.

this approach has been applied successfully to the abelian-higgs vortices [79], with the n -
vortex parameters taken to be the zeros z1, . . ., zn of the scalar  eld [recall the theorem in

49

section 4.1]. for well separated zeros we can think of these zeros as specifying the locations of the
vortices. indeed, the exponential approach of the elds to their asymptotic values motivates and
supports the approximation of well separated vortices as a superposition of single vortices, with
only exponentially small errors. (actually, to be a bit more precise, the n-vortex moduli space is
not really cn ; we need to take into account the identical nature of the vortices and factor out by
the permutation group sn . thus the true n-vortex moduli space is cn /sn , for which a good set
of global coordinates is given by the symmetric polynomials in the zeros z1, . . ., zn .)

the total energy functional is

where the kinetic energy is

h = t + v

t = z d2x(cid:20) 1

2

ai ai + | |2(cid:21)

(214)

(215)

and the potential energy v is the static energy functional (135). there is also the gauss law
constraint, ~  ~e = j 0, to be imposed.
in the adiabatic approximation, the potential energy
remains xed at v2||, given by the saturated bogomolnyi bound (144). but when the moduli
space parameters become time dependent, we can insert these adiabatic elds

 = (~x; z1(t), . . . , zn (t)),

~a = ~a(~x; z1(t), . . . , zn (t))

(216)

into the kinetic energy (215), integrate over position ~x, and obtain an eective kinetic energy for
the moduli parameters za(t), for a = 1, . . . n . in terms of real coordinates ~xa on the plane, this
kinetic energy takes the form

t =

1
2

gab

~xa  ~xb

(217)

where the metric gab is a (complicated) function depending on the positions and properties of all
the vortices. samols [79] has shown that this construction has a beautiful geometric interpretation,
with the metric gab being hermitean and kahler. furthermore, the dynamics of the slowly moving
vortices corresponds to geodesic motion on the moduli space. while the metric cannot be derived in
closed form, much is known about it, and it can be expressed solely in terms of the local properties
of the vortices. it should be mentioned that the step of performing the spatial integrations to reduce
the eld theoretic kinetic energy (215) to the nite dimensional moduli space kinetic energy (217)
involves some careful manipulations due to the nature of vortex solutions in the neighbourhood of
the zeros of the scalar eld . the essential procedure is rst to excise small discs surrounding the
zeros. the contributions from the interior of the discs can be shown to be negligible as the size of
the disc shrinks to zero. the contribution from the outside of the discs can be projected onto a
line integral around each disc, using stokess theorem and the linearized bogomolnyi self-duality
equations. these line integrals may then be expressed in terms of the local data of the scalar elds
in the neighbourhood of each disc :

ln||2  ln|z  zk|2 + ak +

1
2 {bk(z  zk) + bk(z  zk)} + . . .

(218)

there are several important dierences complicating the direct application of this geodesic
approximation to the dynamics of the relativistic chern-simons vortices described in section 4.2.

50

while it is still true that the static multi-vortex solutions can be characterized by the zeros of
the scalar eld [although no rigorous proof of uniqueness has been given so far], the fact that the
vortices appear to be anyonic means that we cannot simply factor out by the symmetric group
sn to obtain the true moduli space. presumably the true moduli space would need to account for
braidings of the vortex zeros. second, the gauge eld makes no contribution to the kinetic energy in
the case of chern-simons vortices  all the dynamics comes from the scalar eld. correspondingly,
even though there are no repulsive or attractive forces between the static self-dual vortices, there
may still be velocity dependent forces that we do not see in the completely static limit. thus, it is
more convenient to consider the eective action (rather than the energy) for motion on the moduli
space. both these considerations suggest that we should expect a term linear in the velocities, in
addition to a quadratic kinetic term like that in (217).

to see how these velocity dependent forces might arise, consider the relativistic chern-simons

vortex model (152):

lrcs = |d0|2 + a0b 


2

ijai aj  | ~d|2 

1
2||2(||2  v2)2

(219)

decomposing  = ei as in (146), gausss law determines the nondynamical eld a0 to be:
a0 =    b

2 . then the lagrangian (219) can be re-expressed as

lrcs =

2
  b  


2

ijai aj "|d|2 +

2

4 (cid:18)b 

2

2 (  v2)(cid:19)2#  v2b

(220)

to implement mantons procedure, we take elds that solve the static self-dual equations (160), but
with adiabatically time-dependent parameters. as moduli parameters we take the zeros ~qa(t) of the
 eld. then the term in the square brackets in (220) vanishes for self-dual solutions. furthermore,
a=1 arg(~x  ~qa(t)). then we can integrate

over ~x to obtain an eective quantum mechanical lagrangian for the vortex zeros:

for an n vortex solution the vorticity is such that  = pn

l(t) = z d2xl =

(221)

the term linear in the velocities comes from the b  term in (220), while the ijai aj term integrates
to zero [81]. the coecient of the linear term is

a = 2ijxb6=a
ai

b

a  qj
qj
|~qa  ~qb|2 + local

(222)

where the rst term is responsible for the anyonic nature of the vortices, while the local term
is only known approximately in terms of the local expansion (218) in the neighbourhood of each
vortex, and is a complicated function of the positions of all the vortices. the linear coecient
ai
a is interpreted as a linear connection on the moduli space. but, despite a number of attempts
[80, 81], we still do not have a good understanding of the quadratic metric term gij in the eective
lagrangian (221). this is an interesting outstanding problem.

51

another important problem concerns the implementation of this adiabatic approximation for
the description of vortex dynamics in nonrelativistic chern-simons theories, such as the jackiw-pi
model or the zhang-hansson-kivelson model. in these cases the eld lagrangian has only rst-order
time derivatives, so the nature of the adiabatic approximation is somewhat dierent [82, 83].

5

induced chern-simons terms

an important feature of chern-simons theories is that chern-simons terms can be induced by
radiative quantum eects, even if they are not present as bare terms in the original lagrangian.
the simplest manifestation of this phenomenon occurs in 2 + 1 dimensional qed, where a chern-
simons term is induced in a simple one-loop computation of the fermion eective action [84]. such
a term breaks parity and time-reversal symmetry, as does a fermion mass term m . there are two
complementary ways to investigate this eective action  the rst is a direct perturbative expansion
in powers of the coupling for an arbitrary background gauge eld, and the second is based on a
schwinger-style calculation of the induced current < j  > (from which the form of the eective
action may be deduced) in the presence of a special background with constant eld strength f .
chern-simons terms can also be induced in gauge theories without fermions, and in the broken
phases of chern-simons-higgs theories. interesting new features arise when we consider induced
chern-simons terms at nite temperature.

5.1 perturbatively induced chern-simons terms : fermion loop

we begin with the perturbative eective action. to facilitate later comparison with the nite
temperature case, we work in euclidean space. the one fermion loop eective action is

se [a, m] = nf log det(i/ + a/ + m)

(223)

where m is a fermion mass. the physical signicance of this fermion mass will be addressed below.
we have also included the overall factor of nf corresponding to the number of fermion avours.
this, too, will be important later. for now, simply regard nf and m as parameters.

a straightforward perturbative expansion yields

se [a, m] = nf tr log(i/ + m) + nf tr(cid:18)

tr(cid:18)

a/(cid:19) + . . .

(224)

the rst term is just the free (a = 0) case, which is subtracted, while the second term is the
tadpole. since we are seeking an induced chern-simons term, and the abelian chern-simons term
is quadratic in the gauge eld a, we restrict our attention to the quadratic term in the eective
action (interestingly, we shall see later that this step is not justied at nite temperature)

corresponding to the one-fermion-loop self-energy diagram shown in figure 9 (a). furthermore,
since the chern-simons term involves the parity-odd levi-civita tensor , we consider only the
 contribution to the fermion self-energy. this can arise because of the special property of the
gamma matrices (here, euclidean) in 2 + 1 dimensions

tr( ) = 2

(227)

(note that this may be somewhat unfamiliar because in 3 + 1 dimensions we are used to the fact
that the trace of an odd number of gamma matrices is zero). it is then easy to see from (226) that
the parity odd part of the kernel has the form

term (at zero temperature). the self-energy diagram (a) is computed in (226), while the three-
photon-leg diagram (b) is treated in exercise 5.1.1

we now come to the physical interpretation of these results [84]. consider the evaluation of
the qed eective action (223) at zero fermion mass. the computation of se [a, m = 0] requires
regularization because of ultraviolet (p  ) divergences. this regularization may be achieved,
for example, by the standard pauli-villars method:

sreg
e [a, m = 0] = se[a, m = 0]  lim
m

se [a, m ]

(234)

the pauli-villars technique respects gauge invariance. but the m   limit of the second term
in (234) produces an induced chern-simons term, because of the perturbative large mass result
(230). therefore, in the process of maintaining gauge invariance we have broken parity symmetry
 this is initiated by the introduction of the pauli-villars mass term m  which breaks parity, and
survives the m   limit in the form of an induced chern-simons term (231). this is the parity
anomaly of 2+ 1 dimensional qed [84]. it is strongly reminiscent of the well known axial anomaly
in 3 + 1 dimensions , where we can maintain gauge invariance only at the expense of the discrete
axial symmetry. there, pauli-villars regularization introduces a fermion mass which violates the
axial symmetry. recall that there is no analogous notion of chirality in 2 + 1 dimensions because of
the dierent dirac gamma matrix algebra; in particular, there is no 5 matrix that anticommutes
with all the gamma matrices . nevertheless, there is a parity anomaly that is similar in many
respects to the 3 + 1 dimensional axial anomaly.

in the nonabelian case, the induced chern-simons term (233) violates parity but restores invari-
ance under large gauge transformations. it is known from a nonperturbative spectral ow argument
[84] that se [a, m = 0] for a single avour of fermion (nf = 1) is not gauge invariant, because
the determinant (of which se is the logarithm) changes by a factor (1)n under a large gauge
transformation with winding number n . thus se [a, m = 0] is shifted by n i. but the induced
chern-simons term (233) also shifts by n i, when nf = 1, under a large gauge transformation
with winding number n . these two shifts cancel, and the regulated eective action (234) is gauge
invariant. this is reminiscent of wittens su(2) anomaly in 3 + 1 dimensions [85]. this is a
situation where the chiral fermion determinant changes sign under a large gauge transformation

54

with odd winding number, so that the corresponding eective action is not invariant under such
a gauge transformation. as is well known, this anomaly is avoided in theories having an even
number nf of fermion avours, because the shift in the eective action is nf n i, which is always
an integer multiple of 2i if nf is even (here n is the integer winding number of the large gauge
transformation). the same is true here for the parity anomaly in the nonabelian 2 + 1 dimensional
case; if nf is even then both se [a, m = 0] and the induced chern-simons term separately shift
by a multiple of 2i under any large gauge transformation.

these results are from one-loop calculations. nevertheless, owing to the topological origin of
the chern-simons term, there is a strong expectation that the induced chern-simons terms should
receive no further corrections at higher loops. this expectation is based on the observation that
in a nonabelian theory the chern-simons coecient must take discrete quantized values in order
to preserve large gauge invariance. at one loop we have seen that the induced coecient is nf
2 ,
which is an integer for even numbers of fermion avours, and reects the parity anomaly in theories
with an odd number of fermion avours. at higher loops, if there were further corrections they
would necessarily destroy the quantized nature of the one-loop coecient. this suggests that
there should be no further corrections at higher loops. this expectation has strong circumstantial
evidence from various higher order calculations. indeed, an explicit calculation [86] of the two-loop
induced chern-simons coecient for fermions showed that the two-loop contribution vanishes, in
both the abelian and nonabelian theories. this is a highly nontrivial result, with the zero result
arising from cancellations between dierent diagrams. this led to a recursive diagrammatic proof
by coleman and hill [87] that in the abelian theory there are no contributions to the induced
chern-simons term beyond those coming from the one fermion loop self-energy diagram. this has
come to be known as the coleman-hill theorem. there is, however, some important ne-print 
the coleman-hill proof only applies to abelian theories (and zero temperature) because it relies on
manifest lorentz invariance and the absence of massless particles.

5.2

induced currents and chern-simons terms

another way to compute the induced chern-simons term in the fermionic eective action (223)
is to use schwingers proper time method to calculate the induced current < j  >, and deduce
information about the eective action from the relation

< j  >=



a

se [a]

(235)

schwingers famous proper-time computation [88] showed that the 3+1 dimensional qed eective
action can be computed exactly for the special case of a background gauge eld a whose corre-
sponding eld strength f is constant. the corresponding calculation in 2 + 1 dimensions [84] is
actually slightly easier because there is only a single lorentz invariant combination of f , namely
f f  . (in 3 + 1 dimensions there is also f f  .) schwingers proper-time technique is also
well-suited for computing the induced current < j  > in the presence of a constant background
eld strength.

a constant eld strength may be represented by a gauge eld linear in the space-time coordi-
2 xf, with f being the constant eld strength. since a is linear in x, nding the

spectrum of the dirac operator /+ia/ reduces to nding the spectrum of a harmonic oscillator. this
spectrum is simple and discrete, thereby permitting an explicit exact solution. this computation
does, however, require the introduction of a regulator mass m for the fermions. the result for the
induced current is [84]

by lorentz invariance, we conclude that this result should hold for nonconstant background elds,
at least to leading order in a derivative expansion. this is the result for a single avour of fermions.
for nf avours the result is simply multiplied by nf . integrating back to get the eective action,
we deduce that the eective action must have the form

se[a] = sna

where sna
e [a] is parity even but nonanalytic in the background eld. this agrees with the per-
turbative calculation described in the previous section. furthermore, we can also do this same
computation of the induced current for special nonabelian backgrounds with constant eld strength
(note that a constant nonabelian eld strength, f = a  a + [a, a], can be obtained
by taking commuting gauge elds that are linear in the space-time coordinates, as in the abelian
case, or by taking constant but non-commuting gauge elds).

that are parity preserving but nonanalytic in the background eld strength, by computing the
eective energy of 2 + 1 dimensional fermions in a constant background magnetic eld b. make

5.3

induced chern-simons terms without fermions

the issue of induced chern-simons terms becomes even more interesting when bare chern-simons
terms are present in the original lagrangian. then chern-simons terms may be radiatively induced
even in theories without fermions. in a classic calculation, pisarski and rao [10] showed that a
gauge theory of 2 + 1 dimensional su (n ) yang-mills coupled to a chern-simons term has, at
one-loop order, a nite additive renormalization of the bare chern-simons coupling coecient:

4ren = 4bare + n

(238)

where the n corrsponds to the n of the su (n ) gauge group. this radiative correction is consistent
with the discretization condition [recall (61)] that the chern-simons coecient 4 must be an
integer for consistency with large gauge invariance at the quantum level. as such, this integer-
valued nite shift is a startling result, since it arises from a one-loop perturbative computation,
which a priori we would not expect to know anything about the nonperturbative large gauge
transformations.

56

here i briey outline the computation of the renormalized chern-simons coecient in such a

(245)
the important divergences are in the infrared (p2  0), and we dene the renormalized chern-

there is also, of course, charge renormalization to be considered. the renormalized charge is

e2
ren =

z(0)( z(0))2

(247)

where z(p2) comes from the renormalization of the ghost propagator. in writing this expression
for the renormalized charge we have used the standard perturbative ward-takahashi identities
for (innitesimal) gauge invariance (note, however, that the chern-simons term introduces new
vertices; but this is only a minor change). the important thing is that none of the ward-takahashi
identities places any constraint on zm(0), which comes from the odd part of the gauge self-energy

57

at zero external momentum (245). the renormalization factors z(0) and z(0) are nite in landau
gauge, and a straightforward (but messy) one-loop calculation [10] leads to the results

e2(cid:19) zm(0)( z(0))2 = (cid:18) m

(249)

(250)

it is widely believed that this is in fact an all-orders result, although no rigorous proof has been
given. this expectation is motivated by the observation that if there were further contributions to
zm(0) and z(0) at two loops, for example,

(cid:18) m

(251)

(where  is some numerical coecient) then the renormalized combination 4( m
e2 )ren could no
longer be an integer. explicit two-loop calculations have shown that there is indeed no two-loop
contribution [89], and there has been much work done (too much to review here) investigating this
nite renormalization shift to all orders. nevertheless, from the point of view of perturbation theory,
the result 4ren = 4bare + n seems almost too good. we will acquire a deeper appreciation of
the signicance of this result when we consider the computation of induced chern-simons terms
using nite temperature perturbation theory in section 5.4.
i should also mention that there
are nontrivial subtleties concerning regularization schemes in renormalizing these chern-simons
theories [90], in part due to the presence of the antisymmetric  tensor which does not yield
easily to dimensional regularization. these issues are particularly acute in the renormalization of
pure chern-simons theories (no yang-mills term).

the story of induced chern-simons terms becomes even more interesting when we include scalar
(higgs) elds and spontaneous symmetry breaking. in a theory with a higgs scalar coupled to a
gauge eld with a bare chern-simons term, there is a radiatively induced chern-simons term at one
loop. if this higgs theory has a nonabelian symmetry that is completely broken, say su (2)  u (1),
then the computation of the zero momentum limit of the odd part of the gauge self-energy suggests
the shift

4ren = 4bare + f (cid:18) mhiggs
mcs (cid:19)

(252)

where f is some complicated (noninteger!) function of the dimensionless ratio of the higgs and
chern-simons masses [91]. so 4ren is not integer valued. but this is not a problem here because
there is no residual nonabelian symmetry in the broken phase, since the su (2) symmetry has

58

been completely broken. however, consider instead a partial breaking of the original nonabelian
symmetry [say from su (3) to su (2)] so that the broken phase does have a residual nonabelian
symmetry. then, remarkably, we nd [92, 93] that the complicated function f reduces to an
integer: 4ren = 4bare +2, (the 2 corresponds to the residual su (2) symmetry in this case). this
result indicates a surprising robustness at the perturbative level of the nonperturbative discreteness
condition on the chern-simons coecient, when there is a nonabelian symmetry present.

actually, in the case of complete symmetry breaking, the shift (252) should really be interpreted
as the appearance of would be chern-simons terms in the eective action. for example, a term
tr(df) in the eective action is gauge invariant, and in the higgs phase in which  <  >
at large distances, this term looks exactly like a chern-simons term. this is because we extracted
the chern-simons coecient in the large distance (p2  0) limit where  could be replaced by
its asymptotic expectation value <  >. this observation has led to an interesting extension of
the coleman-hill theorem to include the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking [94]. however,
in the partial symmetry breaking case no such terms can be written down with the appropriate
symmetry behaviour, so this eect does not apply in a phase with residual nonabelian symmetry.
correspondingly, we nd that the integer shift property does hold in such a phase.

5.4 a finite temperature puzzle

in this section we turn to the question of induced chern-simons terms at nonzero temperature.
all the results mentioned above are for t = 0. the case of t > 0 turns out to be signicant
both for practical and fundamental reasons.
in the study of anyon superconductivity [95] one
of the key steps involves a cancellation between the bare chern-simons term and an induced
chern-simons term. while this cancellation was demonstrated at t = 0, it was soon realised
that at t > 0 this same cancellation does not work because the nite t induced chern-simons
coecient is temperature dependent. the resolution of this puzzle is not immediately obvious.
this strange t dependent chern-simons coecient has also caused signicant confusion regarding
the chern-simons discreteness condition: 4 = integer. it seems impossible for a temperature
dependent chern-simons coecient (t ) to satisfy this consistency condition. however, recent
work [96, 97, 98, 99] has led to a new understanding and appreciation of this issue, with some
important lessons about nite temperature perturbation theory in general.

we concentrate on the induced chern-simons terms arising from the fermion loop, as discussed
in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but now generalized to nonzero temperature. recall from (229) and (230)
that the induced chern-simons coecient is essentially determined by

if we simply generalize this one loop calculation to nite temperature (using the imaginary time

(254)

where we have used the fact that at nite temperature the energy k0 takes discrete values (2n +
1)t , for all integers n  z.

exercise 5.4.1 : take the expression (254) and do the ~k integrals and then the k0 summation,

(255)

thus, it looks as though the induced chern-simons coecient is temperature dependent. note
that the result (255) reduces correctly to the zero t result (253) because tanh( |m|2 )  1 as t  0
(i.e., as   ).
indeed, the t > 0 result is just the t = 0 result multiplied by the smooth
function tanh( |m|2 ). this result has been derived in many dierent ways [100], in both abelian and
nonabelian theories, and in both the real time and imaginary time formulations of nite temperature
eld theory. the essence of the calculation is as summarized above.

on the face of it, a temperature dependent induced chern-simons term would seem to violate
large gauge invariance. however, the nonperturbative (spectral ow) argument for the response of
the fermion determinant to large gauge transformations at zero t [84] is unchanged when generalized
to t > 0. the same is true for the hamiltonian argument for the discreteness of 4 in the
canonical formalism. thus the puzzle. is large gauge invariance really broken at nite t , or is
there something wrong with the application of nite t perturbation theory? we answer these
questions in the next sections. the essential new feature is that at nite temperature, other parity
violating terms (other than the chern-simons term) can and do appear in the eective action;
and if one takes into account all such terms to all orders (in the eld variable) correctly, the full
eective action maintains gauge invariance even though it contains a chern-simons term with a
temperature dependent coecient. in fact, it is clear that if there are higher order terms present
(which are not individually gauge invariant), one cannot ignore them in discussing the question of
invariance of the eective action under a large gauge transformation. remarkably, this mechanism
requires the existence of nonextensive terms (i.e., terms that are not simply space-time integrals of
a density) in the nite temperature eective action, although only extensive terms survive in the
zero temperature limit.

5.5 quantum mechanical finite temperature model

the key to understanding this nite temperature puzzle can be illustrated with a simple exactly
solvable 0 + 1 dimensional chern-simons theory [96]. this is a quantum mechanical model, which
at rst sight might seem to be a drastic over-simplication, but in fact it captures the essential
points of the 2 + 1 dimensional computation. moreover, since it is solvable we can test various
perturbative approaches precisely.

consider a 0+1 dimensional eld theory with nf avours of fermions j, j = 1 . . . nf , minimally
coupled to a u (1) gauge eld a. it is not possible to write a maxwell-like kinetic term for the gauge
eld in 0 + 1 dimensions, but we can write a chern-simons term - it is linear in a.
[recall that
it is possible to dene a chern-simons term in any odd dimensional space-time]. we formulate
the theory in euclidean space (i.e., imaginary time  , with   [0, ]) so that we can go smoothly
between nonzero and zero temperature using the imaginary time formalism. the lagrangian is

l =

nf

xj=1

j (  ia + m) j  ia

(256)

there are many similarities between this model and the 2+1 dimensional model of fermions coupled
to a nonabelian chern-simons gauge eld. first, this model supports gauge transformations with
nontrivial winding number. this may look peculiar since it is an abelian theory, but under the u (1)
gauge transformation   ei, a  a +  , the lagrange density changes by a total derivative
and the action changes by

s = iz 

0

d   = 2in

(257)

where n  1
transformation.

2 r 

0 d   is the integer-valued winding number of the topologically nontrivial gauge

exercise 5.5.1 : show that, in the imaginary time formalism, such a nontrivial gauge trans-
2 ); while, in real time, a nontrivial gauge transformation is (t) =

formation is ( ) = 2n 
2n arctan(t). in each case, explain why the winding number n must be an integer.

 (  

from (257) we see that choosing  to be an integer, the action changes by an integer multiple
of 2i, so that the euclidean quantum path integral es is invariant. this is the analogue of
the discreteness condition (61) on the chern-simons coecient in three dimensional nonabelian
chern-simons theories. (the extra 4 factor in the 2 + 1 dimensional case is simply a solid angle
normalization factor.)

another important similarity of this quantum mechanical model to its three dimensional coun-
terpart is its behaviour under discrete symmetries. under naive charge conjugation c :   ,
a  a, both the fermion mass term and the chern-simons term change sign. this mirrors the
situation in three dimensions where the fermion mass term and the chern-simons term each change

61

sign under a discrete parity transformation. in that case, introducing an equal number of fermions
of opposite sign mass, the fermion mass term can be made invariant under a generalized parity
transformation. similarly, with an equal number of fermion elds of opposite sign mass, one can
generalize charge conjugation to make the mass term invariant in our 0 + 1 dimensional model.

induced chern-simons terms appear when we compute the fermion eective action for this

theory:

s[a] = log(cid:20) det (  ia + m)

det ( + m)

(cid:21)nf

(258)

the eigenvalues of the operator   ia + m are xed by imposing the boundary condition that
the fermion elds be antiperiodic on the imaginary time interval, (0) = (), as is standard at
nite temperature. since the eigenfunctions are

(259)

(260)

(261)

(262)

the antiperiodicity condition determines the eigenvalues to be

( ) = e(m) +ir 

a( )d 

n = m  i

(2n  1)i

n = , . . . , +

where we have dened

a  z

which is just the 0 + 1 dimensional chern-simons term.

given the eigenvalues (260), the determinants in (258) are simply

det (  ia + m)

det ( + m)

m + (2n1)i




 =

cosh(cid:16) m
2(cid:17)
2  i a
2 (cid:17)
cosh(cid:16) m

where we have used the standard innite product representation of the cosh function. thus, the
exact nite temperature eective action is

s[a] = nf log(cid:20)cos(cid:18) a

2(cid:19)  i tanh(cid:18) m

2 (cid:19) sin(cid:18) a
2(cid:19)(cid:21)

(263)

several comments are in order. first, notice that the eective action s[a] is not an extensive
quantity (i.e., it is not an integral of a density). rather, it is a complicated function of the

chern-simons action: a = r d a. we will have more to say about this later. second, in the zero

temperature limit, the eective action reduces to

s[a]t =0 = i

nf
2

m

|m|z d a( )

(264)

which [compare with (233)] is an induced chern-simons term, with coecient  nf

2 . this mirrors
precisely the zero t result (231) for the induced chern-simons term in three dimensions [the factor

62

of 1
4 is irrelevant because with our 2 + 1 dimensional normalizations it is 4 that should be an
integer, while in the 0 + 1 dimensional model it is  itself that should be an integer. this extra 4
is just a solid angle factor].

at nonzero temperature the eective action is much more complicated. a formal perturbative

expansion of the exact result (263) in powers of the gauge eld yields

s[a] = i

the rst term in this perturbative expansion

tanh(

(265)

(266)

is precisely the chern-simons action, but with a temperature dependent coecient. moreover,
this t dependent coecient is simply the zero t coecient from (264), multiplied by the smooth
function tanh( |m|2 ). once again, this mirrors exactly what we found in the 2 + 1 dimensional case
in the previous section  see (253) and (255).

if the computation stopped here, then we would arrive at the apparent contradiction mentioned

earlier  namely, the renormalized chern-simons coecent

ren = bare 

nf
2

tanh(

m

)

(267)

would be temperature dependent, and so could not take discrete values. thus, it would seem that
the eective action cannot be invariant under large gauge transformations.

the aw in this argument is clear. at nonzero temperature there are other terms in the eective
action, besides the chern-simons term, which cannot be ignored; and these must all be taken
into account when considering the question of the large gauge invariance of the eective action.
indeed, it is easy to check that the exact eective action (263) shifts by (nf n )i, independent
of the temperature, under a large gauge transformation, for which a  a + 2n . but if the
perturbative expansion (265) is truncated to any order in perturbation theory, then the result
cannot be invariant under large gauge transformations: large gauge invariance is only restored once
we resum all orders. the important point is that the full nite t eective action transforms under
a large gauge transformation in exactly the same way as the zero t eective action. when nf n
is odd, this is just the familiar global anomaly, which can be removed (for example) by taking an
even number of avours, and is not directly related to the issue of the temperature dependence of
the chern-simons coecient. the clearest way to understand this global anomaly is through zeta
function regularization of the theory [97], as is illustrated in the following exercise.

exercise 5.5.2 : recall the zeta function regularization denition of the fermion determinant,

det(o) = exp((0)), where the zeta function (s) for the operator o is

2(cid:19)  i tanh(cid:18) m

szeta[a] = i

where the sum is over the entire spectrum of o. using the eigenvalues in (260), express this
zeta function for the 0 + 1 dimensional dirac operator in terms of the hurwitz zeta function
h(s, v)  pn=0(n + v)s. hence show that the zeta function regularized eective action is

2 (cid:19) sin(cid:18) a
2(cid:19)(cid:21)
[you will need the hurwitz zeta function properties : h(0, v) = 1
2  v, and h(0, v) = log (v) 
1
2 log(2)]. the sign ambiguity in the rst term corresponds to the ambiguity in dening ()s. the
eect of this additional term is that the zeta function regularized eective action (269) changes by
an integer multiple of 2i under the large gauge transformation a  a+ 2n , even when nf is odd.
show that this is consistent with the fact that this large gauge transformation simply permutes the
eigenvalues in (260) and so should not aect the determinant. (note that this explanation of the
global anomaly [101] is independent of the temperature, so it is somewhat beside the point for the
resolution of the problem of an apparently t dependent chern-simons coecient.)

(269)

to conclude this section, note that only the rst term in the perturbative expansion (265) sur-
vives in the zero temperature limit. the higher order terms all vanish because they have factors
of sech2( m
2 ). this is signicant because all these higher order terms are nonextensive  they are
powers of the chern-simons action. we therefore do not expect to see them at zero tempera-
ture. indeed, the corresponding feynman diagrams vanish identically at zero temperature. this
is usually understood by noting that they must vanish because there is no gauge invariant (even
under innitesimal gauge transformations) term involving more than one factor of a( ) that can be
written down. this argument, however, assumes that we only look for extensive terms; at nonzero
temperature, this assumption breaks down and correspondingly we shall see that our notion of
perturbation theory must be enlarged to incorporate nonextensive contributions to the eective
action. for example, let us consider an action quadratic in the gauge elds which can have the
general form

s(2)[a] =

1

2 z d1 d2 a(1)f (1  2)a(2)

(270)

where, by symmetry, f (1  2) = f (2  1). under an innitesimal gauge transformation,
a  a +  , this action changes by: s(2)[a] = r d1 d2 (1)1 f (1  2)a(2). clearly,
the action (270) will be invariant under an innitesimal gauge transformation if f = 0. this
corresponds to excluding such a quadratic term from the eective action. but the action can also
be invariant under innitesimal gauge transformations if f = constant, which would make the
quadratic action (270) nonextensive, and in fact proportional to the square of the chern-simons
action. the origin of such nonextensive terms will be discussed in more detail in section 5.7 in the
context of nite temperature perturbation theory.

5.6 exact finite temperature 2 + 1 eective actions

based on the results for the 0 + 1 dimensional model described in the previous section, it is possible
to compute exactly the parity violating part of the 2 + 1 dimensional qed eective action when

64

the backgound gauge eld a(~x,  ) takes the following special form:

a0(~x,  ) = a0,

~a(~x,  ) = ~a(~x)

and the static background vector potential ~a(~x) has quantized ux:

z d2xijiaj = z d2x b = 2n ,

n  z

(271)

(272)

under these circumstances, the three dimensional nite temperature eective action breaks up
into an innite sum of two dimensional eective actions for the two dimensional background ~a(~x).
to see this, choose euclidean gamma matrices in three dimensions to be: 0 = i3, 1 = i1,
2 = i2. then the dirac operator appearing in the three dimensional eective action is

 i(/  ia/) + m = (cid:18) 0  ia0 + m

d+

d

0 + ia0 + m(cid:19)

(273)

where d = d1  id2 are independent of  by virtue of the ansatz (271). recalling that at nite
t the operator 0 has eigenvalues (2n+1)i
, for n  z, we see that the problem is reduced to an
innite set of euclidean two dimensional problems.
g(cid:19), and eigenvalues , of the massless two dimensional
0 (cid:19)(cid:18) f

to proceed, consider the eigenfunctions(cid:18) f
(cid:18) 0 d

g(cid:19) = (cid:18) f
g(cid:19)

dirac operator

(274)



d+

it is a straightforward (but messy) algebraic exercise to show that given such an eigenfunction corre-
sponding to a nonzero eigenvalue,  6= 0, it is possible to construct two independent eigenfunctions
 of the three dimensional dirac operator [97] :

  [m  ia0 + (2n+1)i

d+

d

[m + ia0  (2n+1)i

)  is1 +

42 (a0

)2

(275)

(276)

(277)

so, for each nonzero eigenvalue  of the two dimensional problem, there are two eigenvalues  of
the three dimensional dirac operator. but from the form (276) of these eigenvalues, we see that
their contribution to the three dimensional determinant is even in the mass m; and therefore these

65

eigenvalues (coming from nonzero eigenvalues of the two-dimensional problem) do not contribute
to the parity odd part of the three dimensional eective action.

in fact, the only contribution to the parity odd part comes from the zero eigenvalues of the two
dimensional problem. from the work of landau [20] (and aharonov and casher [21]) we know that
there are n = 1
the condition dg = 0, so that the eigenfunctions of the three dimensional dirac operator are

2 r d2xb of these zero eigenvalues. this lowest landau level can be dened by

0 = (cid:18) 0
g(cid:19) ,

where dg = 0

thus the relevant eigenvalues of the three dimensional dirac operator are

(n)
0 = m + ia0 

(2n + 1)i



,

n  z

(278)

(279)

each with degeneracy n .
there is no paired eigenvalue, so to compute the parity odd part of the nite temperature three
dimensional eective action we simply trace over these eigenvalues, and multiply by n . but this
is exactly the same problem that we solved in the last section [see (260)], with n playing the role
of nf , the number of fermion avours. thus, we see immediately that

2 (cid:18)log(cid:20)cos(

)(cid:21)(cid:19)

(280)

where a  a0 = r 

0 a0. this is simply the imaginary part of the 0 + 1 exact eective action (263).
a more rigorous zeta function analysis of this problem has been given in [97], along the lines
outlined in the exercise from the last section. but the key idea is the same  when the three
dimensional gauge background has the restricted static form of (271), the problem reduces to a set
of two dimensional problems; and moreover, only the zero modes of this two dimensional system
contribute to the parity odd part of the three dimensional eective action. this can also be phrased
in terms of chiral jacobians of the two dimensional system [98].

the background in (271) supports large gauge transformations at nite temperature as a conse-
quence of the s1 of the euclidean time direction. so, if ( ) = 2n 
2 ), independent of ~x, then
the gauge transformation a  a + , does not aect ~a, but a0  a0 + 2n 
 . in the notation
of (280) this means a  a + 2n . thus our discussion of these large gauge transformations reduces
exactly to the discussion of the previous section for the 0 + 1 dimensional model.
while this is a nice result, it is still a bit unsatisfying because these are not the nonabelian
large gauge transformations in three dimensions that we were originally considering. in fact, if we
adopt the static ansatz (271) then the abelian chern-simons term reduces to

 (  

z d3xa a = 4n z 

0

a0

66

(281)

which is just the 0 + 1 dimensional chern-simons term. so transformations that stay within this
ansatz are simply the nontrivial winding number transformations of the 0 + 1 dimensional model.
we can make a similar static ansatz in the nonabelian case. for static elds, the nonabelian
chern-simons term simplies to

where ijfij is the (lie algebra valued) nonabelian covariant anomaly in two dimensions.
it is
possible to make gauge transformations that shift this chern-simons action by a constant, and
by choosing ~a appropriately (for example, in terms of unitons) this constant shift can be made
integer mulitple of 2i. but this constant shift is not due to the winding number term in the
change (58) of the nonabelian chern-simons lagrangian under a gauge transformation  rather, it
is due to the total derivtive term. therefore, the simple nonabelian generalization of (280), with a
static nonabelian ansatz, does not really answer the question of what happens to the discreteness
condition (61) at nite temperature.

5.7 finite temperature perturbation theory and chern-simons terms

these results for the nite temperature eective action contain some interesting lessons concerning
nite temperature perturbation theory. the exact results of the previous sections are clearly very
special. for general 2 + 1 dimensional backgrounds we cannot compute the eective action ex-
actly. nor can we do so in truly nonabelian backgrounds that support large gauge transformations
with nonvanishing winding number. furthermore, chern-simons terms may be induced not only
in fermionic systems, but also in chern-simons-yang-mills [10] and in gauge-higgs models with
spontaneous symmetry breaking [91, 92]. in such models there are no known exact results, even at
zero temperature. at nite t , perturbation theory is one of the few tools we have.

an important lesson we learn is that there is an inherent incompatibility between large gauge
invariance and nite temperature perturbation theory. we are accustomed to perturbation theory
being gauge invariant order-by-order in the coupling e, but this is not true for large gauge invariance
at nite temperature. we see this explicitly in the perturbative expansion (265) [note that since
we had absorbed e into the gauge eld a, the order of perturbation is eectively counted by the
number of a factors]. if we truncate this expansion at any nite order, then the result is invariant
under small gauge transformations, but it transforms under a large gauge transformation in a t
dependent manner. it is only when we re-sum all orders, to obtain the exact eective action (263),
that the response of the eective action to a large gauge transformation becomes t independent, as
it should be. there is actually a simple way to understand this breakdown of large gauge invariance
at any nite order of perturbation theory [97]. a gauge transformation (with factors of e restored)
is

a  a +

1
e



(283)

for an innitesimal gauge transformation, the 1
e factor can be absorbed harmlessly into a redef-
inition of the gauge function . but such a rescaling does not remove the e dependence for a
large gauge transformation, because such a gauge transformation must satisfy special boundary

67

conditions at  = 0 and  =  (in the imaginary time formalism). a rescaling of  simply moves e
into the boundary conditions. the eect is that a large gauge transformation can mix all orders in
a perturbative expansion in powers of e, thus destroying the large gauge invariance order-by-order.
diagrammatically, the appearance of higher order terms, other than the chern-simons term, in
the perturbative expansion (265) means that at nite temperature the diagrams with many external
photon legs contribute to the parity odd part of the eective action. this is in contrast to the case
at t = 0 where only a single graph contributes  in 0 + 1 dimensions it is the one-leg graph, and in
2 + 1 dimensions it is the two-leg self-energy graph. actually, these higher-leg graphs are perfectly
compatible with innitesimal gauge invariance, but they violate the zero temperature requirement
of only have extensive quantities in the eective action. in the 0+1 dimensional model, the standard
ward identities for innitesimal gauge invariance [p... = 0, etc ...] simplify (because there is
no contraction of indices) to imply that the diagram is proportional to a product of delta functions
in the external energies. in position space this simply means that each term is proportional to a

nonextensive term like (r a)n. but at zero temperature such nonextensive terms are excluded for

n > 1, and indeed one nds, reassuringly, that the corresponding diagrams vanish identically. at
nite temperature we cannot exclude terms that are nonextensive in time, and so these terms can
appear; and correspondingly we discover that these diagrams are indeed nonvanishing at t > 0.
accepting the possibility of nonextensive terms, the requirement that the fermion determinant
change by at most a sign under a large gauge transformation, a  a + 2n , leads to the general
form:

(2j + 1)a

(2j + 1)a

) + fj sin(

(284)

exp [(a)/nf ] = i



xj=0(cid:18)dj cos(

the actual answer (263) gives as the only nonzero coecients: d0 = 1 and f0 = i tanh( m
fact can only be deduced by computation, not solely from gauge invariance requirements.

2 ). this

these same comments apply to the 2 + 1 dimensional case when the background is restricted
by the static ansatz (271). the static nature of the background once again makes a multi-leg
diagram proportional to a product of delta functions in the external energies. for the answer to be
extensive in space (but possibly nonextensive in time) we can only have one external spatial index,
say i, and then invariance under innitesimal static gauge transformations requires this diagram
to be proportional to ijpj. factoring this out, the remaining diagrams are just like the multi-leg
diagrams of the 0 + 1 dimensional model, and can be computed exactly. [there is a slight infrared
subtlety due to the diculty in fourier transforming a nite ux static background, but this is
easily handled.] so, not surprisingly, the perturbative computation in the static anstaz reduces to
that of the 0 + 1 case, just as happens in the exact evaluation.

as soon as we attempt to go beyond the static ansatz, or consider induced chern-simons
terms in non-fermionic theories, we strike some critical problems. the most signicant is that
the zero momentum limit (230), via which we identied the induced chern-simons terms, is no
longer well dened at nite temperature. this is a physics problem, not just a mathematical
complication. at nite t , lorentz invariance is broken by the thermal bath and so a self-energy
function (p) = (p0, ~p) is separately a function of energy p0 and momentum ~p. thus, as is
well known even in scalar eld theories [102], the limits of p0  0 and ~p  0 do not commute.
the original computations of the nite temperature induced chern-simons coecient [see (255)]

68

explicitly employed the static limit

(p0 = 0, ~p)

lim
|~p|0

(285)

it is easy to see that the opposite limit limp00 (p0,|~p| = 0) gives a dierent answer at nite t
[103]. this ambiguity simply does not arise in the 0 + 1 dimensional model, and the exact 2 + 1
dimensional results of the previous section avoided this ambiguity because the static ansatz (271)
corresponds explicitly to the static limit (285).

finally, another important issue that is not addressed by our 0 + 1 dimensional model, or the
corresponding static 2 + 1 dimensional results, is the coleman-hill theorem [87], which essentially
states that only one-loop graphs contribute to the induced chern-simons term. this is an explicitly
zero temperature result, as the proof assumes manifest lorentz covariance. but the question of
higher loops does not even come up in the 0 + 1 dimensional model, or the static 2 + 1 dimensional
backgrounds, because the photon does not propagate; thus, there are no higher loop diagrams to
consider.

it would be interesting to learn more about nite temperature eective actions whose zero

temperature forms have induced chern-simons terms. there is undoubtedly more to discover.
