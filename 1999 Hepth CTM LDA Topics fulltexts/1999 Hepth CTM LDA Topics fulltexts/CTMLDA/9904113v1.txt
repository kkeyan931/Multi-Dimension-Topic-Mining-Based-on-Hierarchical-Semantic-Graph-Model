abstract

we nd, from the toric description of the moduli space of d3branes on non-compact six-dimensional
singularities c3/z3 and c3/z5 in the blown-down limit, the four-dimensional bases on which
these singular spaces are complex cones, and prove the existence of kahlereinstein metrics on
these four-dimensional bases. this shows, in particular, that one can use the horizons obtained
from these base spaces by a u (1)-foliation as compact parts of the target space for typeiib
string theory with ads5 in the context of the ads-cft correspondence.

1 introduction

the conjecture [1, 2] on the nexus between typeiib superstring theory on ads5  h, where ads5
is the ve-dimensional anti-de sitter space and h is a ve-dimensional variety, called horizon in the
sequel, and superconformal eld theories on the four-dimensional boundary of the ve-dimensional
anti-de sitter space, thought of as a theory of d3branes, has instigated a new spate of research.
the conjecture, known by now as the ads-cft correspondence, has already been tested in sundry
instances. the tests can be broadly classied into two categories. the rst is a consideration of
symmetries of the two candidates. apart from a diagonal u(1) subgroup of the gauge group, cor-
responding to a free-photon in the gauge theory [1, 3, 4], the group of global isometries of the su-
pergravity background in the presence of suitable four-form uxes corresponding to the typeiib
superstring theory is identied with the r-symmetry group of the deemed superconformal theory on
the four-dimensional boundary of ads5 [see, for example, [5]]. the other consists in an identication
of operators in the two theories and in the comparison of their correlation functions [see, for exam-
ple, [3, 6, 7]]. when the ve-dimensional horizon h is the ve-sphere, s5, the conformal counterpart
on the d3brane is the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory of the boundary of ads5. the horizon h
is envisaged as being part of the space, namely c3, transverse to the world-volume of the d3brane.
one of the interesting courses of development in the subject is a generalisation of the original
conjecture [1] to models with less than maximal supersymmetry [2, 4, 8, 9]. considering a theory
of d3branes on a gorenstein canonical singularity of, for example, the type c3/, where  is a
discrete subgroup of su(3), it is possible to break some of the supersymmetries of the eld theory
of the brane. the corresponding candidate dual theory is then the typeiib theory compactied on
ads5 s5/ [2,8]. for example, if  is isomorphic to a z2 subgroup of an su(2) subgroup of su(3),
then the resulting dual theory has been found to be a four-dimensional n = 2 gauge theory [911].

theories of a d3brane on orbifolds of c3 of the form c3/ have been considered earlier, for
different groups . examples include discrete groups  isomorphic to zk, for k = 3, 5 [12], 7, 9,
11 [13], to z2  z2 without discrete torsion [14,15] and with discrete torsion [16,17], as well as some
cases where  is non-abelian [18, 19]. in some of these analyses [1215, 18, 19] the moduli space of
a d3brane at an orbifold singularity, derived as a solution to the f- and d-atness conditions of the
corresponding supersymmetric gauge theory of the d3brane, admits a toric geometric description.
it is interesting to enquire whether one can also use these other cases to derive an admissible horizon
for ads5.

for an appropriate action of a u(1) group on the horizon h, compatible with the complex structure
of its metric cone c(h), one can obtain the toric data of the base hb = h/u(1) from the toric data
of the moduli space of the d3brane on c3/ [4]. it has been shown [20] that if the space hb admits
a kahler-einstein metric, then one can, from the knowledge of the u(1)-action, nd the horizon h by
considering u(1)-bundles of hb. this has been illustrated for several examples arising from partial
resolutions of a c3/(z2  z2) singularity [4].

in order to obtain the horizon from the moduli space of a d3brane, one starts from the eld theory
on the d3brane on c3/. this eld theory is the blown-down limit of the theory of a d3brane on
the calabiyau singularity. in order for this theory to be dual to the typeiib theory on ads5  h,
the horizon h is taken to be a space on which c3/ is a cone. it has been shown that in order to retain
some supersymmetry in the quotient theory, the horizon has to be a sasakieinstein manifold [20,21]
and correspondingly, the manifold hb = h/u(1) must be kahlereinstein. if the group-action of
u(1) on the horizon h is regular, meaning that the orbits of the u(1)-action are closed and have the
same length, the base hb of this u(1)-foliation admits a kahlereinstein metric [4, 22]. see [23] for

1

results with a weaker condition of a quasi-regular u(1)-action. if the discrete group  is isomorphic
to z3, for example, then the group action of u(1) is regular on the horizon [4, 22]. however, if the
u(1)-action on the horizon is not regular, the issue of the existence of kahlereinstein metrics on the
corresponding bases needs be settled on a case by case basis.

in this note we consider the question of the existence of kahlereinstein metrics on the base
hb of the d3brane moduli spaces in two examples, namely d3branes on c3/, where  is a
discrete subgroup of su(3), isomorphic to z3 and z5, that is for the orbifolds c3/z3 and c3/z5.
the rst corresponds to a horizon that admits a regular u(1)-action, while the other does not. the
corresponding theories of d3-branes have been studied earlier [12]. in both cases we work out the
toric data for the base, starting from the toric data of the orbifolds, obtained earlier [12]. we then
prove the existence of a kahlereinstein metric on the respective four-dimensional bases. for the base
of c3/z3, the canonical toric metric is the fubini-study metric on cp2, which is kahlereinstein.
the canonical toric metric on the base of c3/z5 is, however, kahler, but not einstein. we nd out
the condition for the existence of a kahlereinstein metric on hb in terms of a deformation of the
canonical kahler potential, following [25, 26]. this leads to a linear partial differential equation
whose solution purveys a kahlereinstein metric on the corresponding base manifold hb, thereby
establishing the existence of a kahlereinstein metric on hb.

the structure of this note is as follows. in 2, we briey review the argument establishing the
necessity of a kahlereinstein metric on hb, following [20]. in 3, we review the necessary infor-
mation and formulas for the calculations, following [2426]. finally in 4 and 5, we present the
calculation of kahlereinstein metrics on the bases of c3/z3 and c3/z5, before concluding in 6.

2 the cone, the horizon & the base

given a space h, the metric cone c(h) on h is dened by the warped product of h and the half-line,
r+, as c(h) = h r2 r+, endowed with the metric h   ic(h) = dr2 + r2h   ih. here and below we
use subscripts to metrics descriptively whenever convenient. the conical nature of c(h) is discerned
by noting that there exists a group of diffeomorphisms of c(h), isomorphic to the multiplicative
group of real numbers, r+, namely, r 7 t r, for any positive real number t, which rescales the
metric as: h   ic(h) 7 t2h   ic(h). moreover, if the space h admits a transitive u(1)-action, then
one can dene another space hb by quotienting h by the u(1). thus, the space hb can be written
as c(h)/(r+  u(1)), that, in view of the decomposition c = r+  u(1), can be expressed as
c(h)/c. here c denotes the complex-plane with the origin deleted, that is, c = c \ {0}, or, in
other words, the algebraic torus. the metric cone on h can therefore be viewed as a complex cone
over hb. in the sequel we shall refer to the metric cone simply as a cone, while the complex cone
will be explicitly mentioned. also, we shall refer to the space h as the horizon whilst hb will be
referred to as the base (of the complex cone as well as of the horizon).

let us begin by briey recalling some features of supergravity background solutions in the pres-
ence of d3branes preserving some supersymmetry. the solution to the supergravity equations of mo-
tion for the ten-dimensional metric retaining some supersymmetry is sought in the following form [20]

ds2 = e2(xm)dxdx + e2(xm)hmndxmdxn m, n = 1, . . ., 6; ,  = 7, . . ., 10

(2.1)

where the ten-dimensional space-time is taken to be split into two parts. four of the ten directions are
parallel to the world-volume of the d3brane, coordinatized by x,  = 7, . . ., 10, and  denotes
the at-metric. the remaining six coordinates are transverse to the d3brane are denoted by xm,

2

m = 1, . . ., 6. thus, the d3brane is a point in the six-dimensional space coordinatized by xm, m =
1, . . ., 6.
in (2.1), (xm) is a harmonic function of the coordinates of the six-dimensional space
transverse to the world-volume of the d3brane. the six-dimensional metric is chosen to be of the
form

ds2

c(h) = hmndxmdxn = dr2 + r2gijdxidxj,

i, j = 1, . . ., 5

(2.2)

where the ve-dimensional metric gij is the metric on the horizon h that appears in the compactica-
tion of typeiib supergravity on ads5  h. finally, the horizon is envisaged as a u(1)-bundle over
a four-dimensional space hb, with metric of the form

ds2

h = gijdxidxj = ds2

hb + 4(d + aadxa)2,

a, b = 1, 2, 3, 4

where the metric on the four-dimensional base hb is

ds2

hb = gabdxadxb

a, b = 1, 2, 3, 4.

(2.3)

(2.4)

now, if the four-dimensional space hb is a complex kahler surface, with metric gab, then the 1-form
aadxa is the u(1) connection with eld strength f proportional to the kahler two-form  of hb, viz.

f = i.

(2.5)

with the above ansatz, the condition for the existence of a covariant killing spinor in the absence of
d7branes is found to be [20]

rab = 6gab,

(2.6)

where rab denotes the ricci tensor of the metric gab in (2.4). thus, the question of nding out
admissible background solutions reduces to the question of existence of kahlereinstein metric on
the base hb.

one can use the known four-dimensional spaces admitting kahlereinstein metric as candidates
for hb [4]. some of the choices are related to different partial resolutions of the moduli space of
a d3brane on an orbifold c3/(z2  z2), studied earlier [14, 15]. the connections are forged by
considering the toric data of the d-brane orbifolds of c3 in the blown-down limit and then realizing
the horizon h as a line-bundle over a certain base hb inside the orbifold viewed as the level set of
a combination of moment maps obtained by splitting the original one at blown-down [4]. another
interesting case is when the d-brane orbifold is c3/z3. the corresponding base hb is cp2. in this
case (and some others studied in [4]), the horizon h has the structure of a sasakieinstein manifold,
with the aforementioned u(1) providing the corresponding contact structure. moreover, the action
of the u(1) is regular, for such cases the existence of kahlereinstein metrics on the base hb has
been studied earlier [4, 22]. let us point out that many of the mathematical results used in our con-
siderations are strictly valid for compact spaces. however, we continue to use these results for the
non-compact spaces at hand as the compact spaces approximate their non-compact counterparts in a
sufciently small neighborhood of the singular point.

3 kahlereinstein metrics on toric varieties

in this section we introduce the canonical toric metric [24] and its deformation [25, 26]. we also
derive the equations governing the deformation by demanding the resulting metric to be einstein. on
the other hand, the kahlerity of the deformed metric follows from its very construction.

let (x, ) be a compact, connected 2d-dimensional manifold. let  : td  di(x, ) be
an effective hamiltonian action of the standard d-torus td. let  : x  rd denote the associ-
ated moment-map and  the image of x on rd under the moment map,  = (x)  rd. the
convex polytope  is referred to as the moment polytope. the triple (x, ,  ) is determined up to
isomorphism by the moment polytope [24]. the polytope  in rd is called delzant if there are d
edges meeting at each vertex p of  and any edge meeting at p can be given the form p + svi, for
0  s  , where {vi} is a basis of zd [24, 25]. conversely, one can associate a toric variety x
with the above properties to a delzant polytope  in rd, such that  is the moment polytope of x.
let x = x be the toric variety associated to  that is, x = (), where  denotes the pull-back
of .

the moment polytope  can be described by a set of inequalities of the form hy, uii  i,
i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., d  1. here ui denotes the inward-pointing normal to the i-th (d  1)-dimensional face
of  and is a primitive element of the lattice zd  rd. the pairing h , i denotes the standard scalar
product in rd and y represents a d-dimensional real vector. we can thus dene a set of linear maps,
i : rn  r,

i(y) = hy, uii  i,

i = 0, 1, . . ., d  1.

(3.1)

denoting the interior of  by , y  , if and only if i(y) > 0 for all i.

on the open td

c-orbit in x, associated to a delzant polytope , the kahler form  can be written

as [24, 25]:

 = i    d1xi=0

i ln i + ! ,

where we have dened  as the sum,

 =

d1xi=0

hy, uii.

(3.2)

(3.3)

the potential in the expression (3.2) for the kahler form  is determined by the equations for faces of
the delzant polytope (3.1). if  is a td-invariant kahler form on the complex torus m = cd/2izd,
then there exists a function f (x), with x = rez, z  c, on m, such that  = 2i f. moreover, the
moment map  : m  rd is given by

the kahler form  can be written in terms of this new function (kahler potential) as:

(z) =

f

(3.4)

the moment-map  denes a legendre transform through (3.4) and thus we can dene a new set of
variables yi, i = 0, . . ., d,

yi =

f
xi

(3.6)

conjugate to xi = re zi. consequently, we can dene a potential g, conjugate to f under the
legendre transform (3.6) on , such that [24, 25],

g =

d1xk=0

the inverse of the legendre transform (3.6) can be shown to be of the form [24]:

k(y) ln k(y).

i = 0,    , d  1,

(3.7)

where ri are constants. this means that up to a linear term in the coordinates yi, g is the kahler
potential legendre-dual to f. moreover, the dd matrix

gij =

evaluated at yi = f

(3.6), is the inverse of the matrix

the ricci-tensor for the metric (3.10) takes the following form:

(3.11)

(3.12)

where gij denotes the inverse of gij. note that, f in (3.11) ( and in (3.13) below) denotes the matrix
fij, and not the kahler potential unlike elsewhere in this note. the ricci-scalar for this metric is then
derived by multiplying (3.12) with gij, which is the inverse of the metric fij in the y coordinates, and
is given by [25]

r =

(3.13)

(3.14)

where f ij denotes the inverse of fij. for our purposes, it will be convenient to use the matrix gij in
the coordinates y. one can, in principle, rewrite all the relevant expressions in terms of the coordinates
xi and the matrix fij.

the expressions for the kahler potential (3.2), the metric (3.10) and the curvature (3.12) described
above will be referred to as the canonical ones. moreover, if  : x  cpn, denotes a projective em-
bedding of x in cpn for some n, then the canonical kahler form , given by (3.2), is td-equivariantly
symplectomorphic to the pull-back of the kahler form fs corresponding to the fubini-study metric
on cpn, namely fs.

however, the curvature of the canonical toric metric is arbitrary in general. in order to obtain a
metric with prescribed  usually constant  curvature, as in our cases, one may need to deform the
canonical kahler form to another one in the same kahler class. this may be effected by adding a
function, smooth on some open subset of rn containing , to the potential g, such that the hessian
of the new potential is positive denite on  in order for the new potential to be kahler. this
furnishes a deformed kahler metric in the same kahler class as the canonical one. the variety x is
then endowed with two different kahler forms related by a tn-equivariant symplectomorphism since
the function f is non-singular. one then nds out the form of this extra function by demanding the
prescribed curvature. this method was used in deriving the extremal kahler metric on cp2#cp2
in calabis form [25] as well as in nding out a ricci-at metric on the resolved dbrane orbifold
c3/z3 [26]. see [27] for another approach involving the heat equation. following the approach

to do next is to write down the general form of the metric for a function f and then determine f by

one can then nd out the kahler metric by inverting egij and hence the curvature for this new metric.
this will also give rise to a new ef corresponding to f and also new coordinatesex. what we propose
demanding that the ricci-tensor given by the formula (3.12) to be proportional to the new metric egij.

for the two cases considered here, the base hb is two-(complex)-dimensional. thus, we have

this yields a differential equation for the function f.

i = 1, 2. specialising to this case, the three components of rij can be written as:

y1y1

 2r11 = eg11  2eg11

if there exists a kahlereinstein metric on hb, then for some choice of the deforming function the

components of the curvature rij must be equal to the components of the metric egij. we nd out

a solution for f by imposing this condition on rij. thus, the condition for the manifold hb to be

let us note that the non-covariant notation for indices in (3.19) originates from the fact that, abiding
by common practice, we have denoted derivatives by subscripts and the metric under consideration
in y variables. here  is a constant parameter that determines the ricci
scalar as r = 2. however, in the following we keep this parameter arbitrary for book-keeping. in
4 and 5, we use equations (3.20)(3.23) to prove the existence of a kahlereinstein metric on hb

4 kahlereinstein metric on the base hb of c3/z3
in this section we consider the blown-down limit of the moduli space of a d3brane on the orbifold
c3/z3. we rst nd out a toric description of the base hb staring from the toric data of c3/z3. then,
following the discussion in 3, we nd out the kahlereinstein metric on this base.

in order to obtain the base hb for blown-down c3/z3, let us start from the charges of the elds.

the toric data derived from f- and d-atness conditions of the gauge theory is given by [12]

1 1 0 0
1 0 1 0
3
0 0 1

 .
t =
q = (ker t )t =(cid:0)1 1 1 3(cid:1) ,

(4.1)

(4.2)

the blown-down moduli space is obtained in terms of charges specied by the kernel of t with the
resolution (fayetiliopoulos ) parameter vanishing. the charge matrix becomes

where a superscript t designates matrix transpose. the resulting moduli space is described by the
following moment-map equation:

|z0|2 + |z1|2 + |z2|2  3|z3|2 = 0,

(4.3)

where {zi|i = 0, 1, 2, 3} are the homogeneous variables on the corresponding toric variety. the
horizon h is obtained as a line-bundle from (4.3), following the construction of [4]

|z0|2 + |z1|2 + |z2|2 = 

and

3|z3|2 = .

(4.4)

the parameter  is left arbitrary in (4.4) for book-keeping. it can be set to unity. equations (4.4)
describe a space s5  s1. the horizon h is obtained from (4.4) after quotienting by a u(1) as
(s5  s1)/u(1), with the u(1)-action on the homogeneous variables given by

u(1) : (z0, z1, z2, z3) 7 (eiz0, eiz1, eiz2, e3iz3).

(4.5)

7

now, to nd the toric description for the base hb, we collect the charges from (4.4) into another
charge-matrix

qb =(cid:18)1 1 1 0
0 0 0 3(cid:19)

(4.6)

and nd out the toric data corresponding to hb as the co-kernel of the transpose of qb. the resulting
toric data is given as

t  = coker qt

b =(cid:18)1 1 0 0
1 0 1 0(cid:19)

leaving out the last column, this can be recognised as the toric data for cp2, namely,

tb =(cid:18)1 1 0
1 0 1(cid:19) .

(4.7)

(4.8)

this description corresponds to the most efcient description of the toric variety hb, as mentioned
in [4]. the two-vectors described by the columns of t  are plotted in figure 1. as in [4], the toric
data tb in (4.8) for hb is obtained after omitting the point in the interior of the triangle. moreover,

the toric data t  in (4.7) can be identied as the rst two rows in the toric data t in (4.1) for c3/z3.
we shall see shortly that the omission of the point in the interior of the polygon is related to the
construction of the delzant polytope corresponding to the variety.

the corresponding canonical toric metric from tb in (4.8) is the fubini-study metric, as given

in [25]. the delzant polytope is given as

y1  0,

y2  0

  y1  y2  0,

(4.9)

where we have shifted the variables yi, i = 1, 2 by the respective values of the support functions ai,
i = 1, 2, at each of the one-dimensional cone generators specied by the columns of tb, following

8

[26]. the kahler structure  is given as  = a0 +a1 +a2, and hence the rst chern-class of the variety,
calculated as the sum of the coefcients of ai in  [24], is constant, c1(x) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. thus,
the variety in question is fano. this corroborates to the fact that the base hb is cp2, as pointed out
in [4]. let us point out that writing down the delzant polytope provides a rationale for the omission
of the interior points of the polygon shown in figure 1 (this, however, is not the delzant polytope):
they do not yield any new face for the delzant polytope. the last column of (4.7) does not affect the
polytope (4.9). the canonical potential g corresponding to the delzant polytope (4.9) is, by (3.7),

g =

1

2(cid:20)y1 ln y1 + y2 ln y2 + (  y1  y2) ln(  y1  y2)(cid:21).

the canonical metric ensuing from the potential (4.10) is given by

gij =

(cid:18)y1(  y1)

y2(  y2).(cid:19)

(4.10)

(4.11)

the ricci-tensor evaluated from (4.11), using (3.12) can be checked to be proportional to the metric
(4.11). that is, the equations (3.20)(3.23) are satised with f = 0 and  = 3/. the ricci-scalar
for this metric is found from this as

r = 

1
2

(2  1  1  2) =

= 2,

(4.12)

as expected from (3.14). thus, we have veried that there does exist a kahlereinstein metric on
the base hb of the blown-down dbrane orbifold c3/z3. the metric is diffeomorphic to the fubini-
study metric, with a constant scalar curvature as given in (4.12).

a comment is in order. a ricci-at metric on the resolved d3brane orbifold c3/z3 was found
out earlier using similar techniques in [26]. this needed a deformation of the canonical toric metric
by a function which was shown to be a solution of the differential equation 1

(4.13)

where y3 denotes the third variable needed to form the delzant polytope of the three-dimensional
variety, c is a constant and  is the resolution parameter (set to zero in (4.3)). the metric on the
complex cone c(h) constructed from the metric (4.11) using (2.2) does not appear to be in the same
form as the one derived in [26] for the resolved dbrane orbifold c3/z3, with vanishing kahler
class. this discrepancy, however, may be attributed to the fact that constancy of the scalar curvature
on the base was not imposed on the metric in [26], as was pointed out there. however, since the
restrictions of the metric (2.2), and the one derived in [26] on the base hb are the same, with suitable
normalisation of y3, there exists some neighborhood of hb in c3/z3 on which the two metrics are
diffeomorphic to one another, thanks to the darboux-weinstein theorem [28].

5 kahlereinstein metric on the base hb of c3/z5
in this section we consider the blown-down limit of the moduli space of a d3brane on c3/z5. first,
let us nd out the toric description of the base hb, from the toric data of the moduli space [12].

we shall mimic the considerations of 4. let us start from the following toric data for the orbifold

c3/z5 [12],

t =

0 0 1 2

(5.1)

(5.2)

the corresponding charge matrix, evaluated as the transpose of the kernel of t takes the form

that leads to two moment map equations in the blown-down limit with vanishing fayetiliopoulos pa-
rameters of the gauge theory:

|z0|2 + |z1|2 + |z3|2  3|z4|2 = 0
|z2|2  2|z3|2 + |z4|2 = 0.

from the charge matrix (5.2), one obtains by row operations (changing basis) the charge matrix

q =(cid:18)1 1 3 5 0
0 0 1 2 1(cid:19) .

(5.3)
(5.4)

(5.5)

q corresponds to eliminating z4 from (5.3) by using (5.4) and leads to the following equation for the
global moment map:

|z0|2 + |z1|2 + 3|z2|2  5|z3|2 = 0.

(5.6)

the horizon h is obtained from (5.6), or from the rst row of q constructing the line-bundle [4]:

|z0|2 + |z1|2 + 3|z2|2 = 

and

5|z3|2 = .

(5.7)

again, we have kept a free-parameter  for book-keeping. equations (5.7) describe a direct product
s5  s1. the corresponding horizon is obtained from (5.7) quotienting by a u(1) as h = (s5 
s1)/u(1), with the u(1)-action given by

u(1) : (z0, z1, z2, z3) 7 (eiz0, eiz1, e3iz2, e5iz3).

(5.8)

this u(1)-action (5.8) is not regular. for instance, the orbits of the points (0, 0, 1, 0) and (1, 0, 0, 0)
are of different lengths. however, we proceed as before to derive the base hb from this, and to this
end write the corresponding charge-matrix as

this leads to the following toric data obtained as the co-kernel of the transpose of qb, namely

1 1 3 0 0
0 0 0 5 0
0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 2 0

 .
qb =

from t , ignoring the last two columns, corresponding to points in the interior of the triangle, as
shown in figure 2, we obtain the toric data for hb as the following rectangular matrix:

tb =(cid:18)0 3 1
1 1 0(cid:19) .

(5.11)

as before, one can identify the matrix t  in (5.10) inside t in (5.1): t  is t with the last row omitted.

tioninobtainingthedelzantpolytope. thelledonescorrespondtotb.

having obtained the toric description for the base hb, we now proceed as in 4, to nd out
the toric metric. we rst derive the canonical toric metric and the scalar curvature to learn that the
latter is not constant, signalling that the canonical toric metric is not kahlereinstein. following
the considerations of 3, we then deform the canonical toric metric and determine the deformation
imposing the condition that the deformed metric is kahlereinstein, as discussed in 3. let us start
by considering the delzant polytope corresponding to the variety hb as expressed in terms of the
toric data tb in (5.11). the delzant polytope  is dened by the following inequalities dictated by
the columns of tb:

y1  0,

y2  0,

  3y1  y2  0.

(5.12)

again the variables are shifted by the values of the respective support functions at the one-dimensional
cone generators, given by the columns on tb. this leads to  = a0 + 3a1 + a2, implying that the rst
chern-class c1(x) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5, whence the variety hb is found to be fano. once again the
omission of the last two columns of t  is justied by their being inconsequential for constructing the
delzant polytope.

the canonical toric metric can be obtained from the potential

g =

1

2(cid:20)y1 ln y1 + y2 ln y2 + (  3y1  y2) ln(  3y1  y2)(cid:21),

(5.13)

and the corresponding matrix gij is

gij =

1

2a(cid:18)9 + a

3

y1

3

y2(cid:19) ,

1 + a

(5.14)

where we have dened a =   3y1  y2. the metric gij derived by inverting (5.14) is not einstein.
indeed, the ricci scalar for this canonical toric metric is:

r =

26 2 + 60y1 + 72y2
1

( + 6y1)3

.

(5.15)

the ricci scalar r is, however, positive denite, since, by (5.12), y1  0 on the delzant polytope .
thus, as mentioned in 3, let us now look for a deformed kahler metric which is einstein, by
deforming the above potential g by a function f. as a simplifying ansatz, we choose f to be a
function of y1 only, f = f (y1), since the ricci-scalar (5.15) depends only on y1. this leads to

where a prime signies differentiation with respect to y1.

expression for egij:

egij =

inverting egij, we obtain the following
f )(cid:19) ,

(5.17)

where f =  + 6y1 + y1f (  3y1) is a nowhere-vanishing function and we have dened  =

(f  9y1)/(  3y1). now we solve (3.20)(3.23) using the expression (5.17) for egij. equation

(3.23) is identically satised as f does not depend on y2. equations (3.21) and (3.22) lead to two
equations respectively,

f(cid:19)  6(cid:16)y1
 4(cid:18) 
f(cid:17)
f(cid:19)
 4(cid:18) 
f(cid:17)
 6(cid:16)y1

= 2,

= 0.

(5.18)

(5.19)

in deriving (5.19) from (3.22), we have used the fact that y2 6= 0, i.e. y  . equation (5.19) can be
obtained by differentiating (5.18) with respect to y1. finally, from (3.20) one derives,

(  3y1)(2y1f 2  y1f f ) + (15y1  2)f f   9f 2 + f 3 = 0,

(5.20)

that, however, is solved identically on using (5.18) and (5.19). thus, one is left with one single
equation for f, namely (5.18), that can be rewritten as

using the expression for , equation (5.21) takes the following form:

3y1f   (2 + 3)f + f 2 = 0.

3y1(  3y1)f   3(  9y1)f +(cid:20)(  3y1)  2(cid:21)f 2 = 0.

12

(5.21)

(5.22)

in order to solve this, we rewrite it further in terms of a new function  = 1/f as:

3y1(  3y1) + 3(  9y1) (cid:20)(  3y1)  2(cid:21) = 0.

(5.23)

equation (5.23) is a linear rst-order differential equation in y1 and can be solved for  and thence
for f resulting in

f =

9y1


,

(5.24)

where  = 1  
following equation for f:

3 (  3y1) + 9c(  3y1)2 and c is a constant of integration. one is then lead to the

f  =

9y1  ( + 6y1)

y1(  3y1)

(5.25)

that can be explicitly integrated to determine the potential eg in y-variables. using (5.25) in the
expression (5.17) for egij yields the desired kahlereinstein metric on the base hb of the cone c3/z5.

6 conclusion

to conclude, in this note we have demonstrated the existence of kahlereinstein metrics on the bases
of the complex cones obtained as moduli spaces of d3branes on c3/z3 and c3/z5 orbifolds. these
cones are, in turn, metric cones over horizons h, and can be used as the internal space in typeiib
string theory on ads5, in the context of the conjectured ads-cft correspondence. the analysis vali-
dates the candidature of the horizon obtained from the blown-down orbifold c3/z5 along with c3/z3,
the latter having already been pointed out in [4]. it seems possible to generalize the considerations
in this note to establish similar results for the existence of kahlereinstein metrics on hb for other
d3brane orbifolds already studied in literature [4, 1315]. however, it is not clear how to extend
this analysis to cases that do not admit a toric description. the metrics presented here, like the one
in [26], are in rather special real variables. it will be interesting to be able to write these metrics in
terms of variables better-suited to studying their geometric properties. we hope to return to this issue
in future.
