grounds. the state is conformally invariant and satises cardys con-
ditions. we apply this construction to two dimensional string theory.

1 introduction

the study of dirichlet branes [1] has played an essential role in the under-
standing of non-perturbative physics of various string vacua. in the strong
coupling regime the d-branes become the lightest bps states, and therefore
play the role of the fundamental degrees of freedom in a dual formulation. d-
instantons, similarly, are important in giving non-perturbative contributions
to scattering amplitudes.

given this success, one is motivated to study d-branes in string vacua
with less symmetries, and sometimes with no clear geometrical interpretation
[2]. some of these string vacua are holographically dual (in the sense of [3])
to non-gravitational theories, and the d-brane spectrum and interactions are
important in the dynamics of those theories.

the study of d-brane in general backgrounds is dicult, and a general
method of construction is unknown. we review the boundary state approach
to the subject in section 2. in particular we review a construction of boundary
states due to cohen, moore, nelson and polchinski [4]. this construction
can be useful in conformal eld theories where the spectrum has a simple
structure.

the examples studied in this paper are conformal eld theories with a
linear dilaton component. we review such backgrounds in section 3, and
construct a dirichlet boundary state for such backgrounds. (we note that
dirichlet boundary states in linear dilaton background have also been consid-
ered in [5]. the boundary state constructed there appears to be conformally
invariant, but does not satisfy cardys conditions, dened below.)

in section 4 we demonstrate the construction by explicitly constructing
d0-branes and d-instantons for the case of 2d string theory [6]. those objects
are relevant in studying non-perturbative questions in 2d string theory. we
describe further applications and directions for future research in the nal
section. an appendix contains a generalization of the boundary state to
incorporate worldsheet supersymmetry.

2 general d-branes

the general construction of a d-brane in an arbitrary string background is
not known. in this section we outline an approach to this problem based on

1

[4]. in the process of doing so, we review some well-known facts about open
string theories, and introduce our notation.

to make the presentation simpler, we concentrate on the matter part
of the cft. one may choose to work in light-cone variables as in [7], or
add a ghost sector and perform a brst quantization [8]. in a conventional
string background, where the ghosts decouple from the matter cft, their
treatment does not depend on the particular background chosen.

the simplest way to construct an open string theory is to impose bound-
ary conditions on the string variables and perform a canonical quantization
in the open string sector. the procedure requires a lagrangian description
of the cft, and is hard to implement in general string backgrounds.

we instead work in the boundary state formalism [8]. in this formalism,
we are given a bulk cft, that is, a closed string background. this bulk
cft is specied by a set of bulk operators and their opes. these ope
coecients are required to satisfy nonlinear constraints: associativity and
modular invariance on the torus. these conditions guarantee consistency of
the theory formulated on an arbitrary riemann surface.

given the bulk cft, we dene a d-object to be an open string theory
consistent with the bulk cft. the building blocks of an open cft, and the
conditions they satisfy, were analysed in [9]. a complete specication of an
open string theory involves the following elements:

-a boundary state |bi which is a generalized coherent state in the closed
string hilbert space. to preserve the conformal invariance, essential for hav-
ing a consistent string theory, one requires:

ln  ln|bi = 0

(1)

string elds.

the state |bi species the tree level couplings of the d-object to all closed
- a set of open string operators (also called boundary operators, or more

precisely boundary condition preserving boundary operators.)

- closed string opes, open string opes, and open-closed opes.
these building blocks have to satisfy nonlinear relations [9], the sewing
constraints. these conditions guarantee the consistency of the theory on an
arbitrary (oriented) riemann surface with boundaries [9].

in the following, we study boundary states in linear dilaton backgrounds.
we emphasize that in principle, the boundary state alone does not specify

2

the open string theory. one has to supply an open string operator algebra
which satises the sewing constraints. the existence of such an operator
algebra might impose further conditions on the possible boundary states.
furthermore, such an operator algebra might not be unique, in which case
distinct d-objects share the same boundary state.

the unique constraint involving only the boundary state is cardys con-

dition [10], introduced below.

our starting point is a solution of the conformal invariance condition (1)
based on any virasoro module in the theory. suppose we are given a level
matched primary of the virasoro algebra of dimensions hl = hr = h. dene

ij li lj|hi
m 1
here i, j are ordered strings of indices n1    nr, and

|bih = xi,j

the contravariant form is dened as

li = ln1    lnr .

mij = hh|li lj|hi = hh| li lj|hi

(2)

(3)

(4)

mij is invertible for any virasoro module. for degenerate modules, one

has to mod out by the null vectors.

it is easy to see that |bih is conformally invariant by showing that (ln 
ln)|bih is orthogonal to all states in the module based on |hi. furthermore,
by an application of schurs lemma, the solution is unique in each virasoro
module [11, 12]. a similar construction can be given for any chiral algebra,
yielding a boundary state preserving one copy of that chiral algebra [13]. in
particular, we extend the discussion to include worldsheet supersymmetry in
appendix a.

the boundary states |bih are the building blocks of any physical bound-
ary state |bi. the physical boundary state is required to satisfy cardys
conditions, which guarantee the existence of open string quantization of the
system. we regard this condition as an eective way of nding a basis of the
physical boundary states in the theory.

cardys conditions on the boundary state are obtained as follows. the
partition function on the annulus can be computed in the closed string sector
as

zb = hb|e2l(l0+ l0

c

12 )|bi = hb|q(l0+ l0

c

12 )|bi

(5)

3

where l is the closed string modulus of the annulus, and q = e2l.

this partition function can be written in terms of the open string modu-
lus, q = et (with t = 1
2l being the open string modulus). as a power series
in q, one can read from zb the dimensions and multiplicities of the open
string operators. as such, all coecients in the series must be nonnegative
integers. the coecient of the unit operator must be one (up to an over-
all multiplicative factor in the boundary state, interpreted as the number of
d-branes.)

finally, in the case of noncompact bosons, one has to allow a slight gen-
eralization. associated with a noncompact boson one has an integration over
continuous momentum in either the open string sector or the closed string
sector. such integrations lead to factors which are nonanalytic in either q or
q. we generalize cardys conditions to allow such factors, since their origin is
clear for noncompact bosons. in fact such factors can be helpful in interpret-
ing the boundary state. for a free boson, a dirichlet boundary state allows
an arbitrary momentum in the closed string sector, while in the neumann
boundary state the open strings can carry arbitrary momentum. we gener-
alize this to any noncompact boson, by dening a dirichlet boundary state
as having no free momentum for the open strings, corresponding intuitively
to open strings with xed endpoints.

3 linear dilaton backgrounds

conformal eld theories with a linear dilaton appear as an ingredient in many
string backgrounds, critical and non-critical. for example, they appear in
the ns 5-brane theory [14],they provide an explicit lagrangian formulation
of virasoro minimal models [15] and wzw models [15], and are an essential
part of 2d string theory [6]. the construction of the dirichlet boundary state
should apply to all such backgrounds.

we demonstrate the construction for the case of the 2d string theory.
the worldsheet theory is liouville theory coupled to a single boson x. the
worldsheet action is then

l = x x +   + e + qr

with q = 22,  = 2 chosen to dene a critical string theory.

(6)

4

2 p2+ 1

the treatment of the free boson is standard, and we focus on the eld .
the states in liouville theory form a continuum |pi, p  0 with dimensions
hp = 1
8 q2. in addition, there is a discrete set of states, the special states,
which form a set of measure zero. the states above do not correspond to
local operators, and as normalizable modes are the appropriate ones to form
a coherent state in the closed string hilbert space.

for generic p, the virasoro module based on |pi is nondegenerate. so it
is straightforward to compute the annulus diagram for the boundary state
|bip (dened as in eq.(5))

phb|e2l(l0+ l0

c

12 )|bip = qp2yn

(1  q2n)q

1

24

(7)

the result is identical to the corresponding calculation for a single free boson.
one can construct then

|bid  xp

eipx0|bip.

(8)

to check cardys conditions we compute the annulus diagram with the
boundary state |bid. after modular transformation, we nd

dhb|e2l(l0+ l0

c

12 )|bid = yn

(1  q2n)q

1

24

(9)

where q is the open string modulus dened above.

therefore the boundary state |bid satises cardys conditions. there
are no logarithmic factors in the open string channel, as appropriate for a
dirichlet boundary state.

we note that the above boundary state has a similar form to the boundary
state of a single free boson. this resemblence is misleading. the liouville
theory is not exactly solvable, and a complete specication of the open string
theory would be dierent from that of d-branes in at space. however, the
boundary state itself is sensitive only to the spectrum, therefore it has a
simple form when expressed in terms of virasoro modules. when expanded
in modes of , the state looks very dierent from the usual dirichlet boundary
state in at space.

we mention in passing that neumann boundary conditions in linear dila-

ton backgrounds were discussed in [16].

5

4 d-branes in 2d string theory

we now turn to the case of 2d string theory, for which we need to include
the free boson x. for a free boson there are standard boundary states

n = exp xn
|bi(x)
d = exp xn
|bi(x)

1
n
1
n

n n! |vaci
n n! |vaci

(10)

(11)

corresponding to neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions respectively.
here ,  are the left- and right-moving modes of x.

we nd then the boundary states of 2d string theory by tensoring the
d , yielding a

state found in the previous section with either |bi(x)
d0-brane or a d-instanton respectively.

n or |bi(x)

the lowest lying modes in the open string sector are the open string
tachyon and the center-of-mass operator. to understand the dynamics of
the d-brane, one needs to write an eective action for these elds. this is
more dicult than in the at space case, because we have dened the d-
brane as a boundary state instead of as a boundary condition on the open
string theory.

in the boundary state formalism, one has to solve the sewing constraints
on open string opes [9], which are nonlinear and generally dicult to solve.
in our case, however, we can solve them in the asymptotic weak coupling
region by a comparison to at space d-branes.

in our construction the boundary state has the same form as a at space
d-brane, except that we have used the primaries of the liouville theory
rather than the standard primaries of at space. furthermore, in the weakly
coupled region, the interactions of the liouville primaries are the same (to
leading order) as the interactions of the free theory. the solution of the
sewing constraints is then the same as in at space and the action is the
standard at space born-infeld action.

in particular, the action for the center of mass is

l =

1

gs(x0)q1  x0

2

(12)

where x0 was dened in eqn. (8). the equation of motion is that of constant
acceleration towards the strong coupling region.

6

in the full liouville theory, solving the sewing constraints requires more
information. by kpz scaling [17, 6], the leading order action scales as 1

since it is obtained from a disc diagram. since the mass is no longer position
dependent, we expect this to describe a static d-brane bound to the wall.

the d-instanton would correspondingly have an action proportional to
1
 and therefore would produce nonperturbative eects in the spacetime the-
 eects found in the matrix model
ory. these correspond to the famous e
[18]. to perform a detailed comparison, though, one needs to nd special
quantities for which the perturbative series can be summed.

1

consideration of black holes in 2d string theory [19] suggests that liouville
theory has many more states than suggested by the perturbative spectrum.
the entropy of black holes suggests in fact a hagedorn density of states [20],
whereas the perturbative spectrum consists only of one 1+1 dimensional
eld (and some special states). the success of entropy counting in higher
dimensions [21] suggests that d-branes and their excitations might provide
the required states.

5 applications

since linear dilaton backgrounds are ubiquitous in string theory, the bound-
ary state found here has many applications. most applications would require
a generalization to incorporate worldsheet supersymmetry and gso projec-
tion. this is straightforward, and the resulting boundary state is constructed
in appendix a.

it has been recently proposed that string theories backgrounds with a
linear dilaton component are holographically dual to nongravitational, non-
local theories [22, 23, 24, 25]. the earliest and best known example is the
near horizon limit of the ns vebranes, which are holographically dual to
the little string theories in 6 dimensions with 16 supercharges [26, 27]. other
examples with fewer supersymmetries and in other dimensions were given in
[24, 25].

our construction can be applied to many such backgrounds since they
consist of a linear dilaton part and an often solvable conformal eld the-
ory. however, many such backgrounds have a strong coupling region where
perturbative string theory is inapplicable. in these cases, the description of
the d-brane as a boundary state is useful only asymptotically, in the weak

7

coupling region.

there are however instances where the weakly coupled string theory is
applicable everywhere [25]. this corresponds to a deformation of the lin-
ear dilaton background analogous to turning on the cosmological constant
in liouville theory.
in such cases, our construction provides an eective
way of describing the d-brane spectrum and interactions. these d-branes
correspond to nonperturbative states in the holographically dual theory.

in particular, some of the backgrounds in [25] are t-dual to noncompact
calabi-yau spaces with a slightly deformed singularity [28]. in such cases, the
d-brane spectrum might be more transparent in the linear dilaton description
of the background.

as mentioned already in section 4, d-branes and d-instantons can shed
light on nonperturbative eects in 2d string theory. in particular, counting
the microscopic states of black holes in 2d string theory requires an under-
standing of the quantum mechanics of the d-branes in this background. in
addition, e1/g eects in the matrix quantum mechanics should be related to
d-instanton eects in the liouville theory.

finally, one can speculate on a holographic relation between the c=1 ma-
trix model and liouville theory, along the lines of [3]. the world-volume
theory on a large number n of d0 branes in a linear dilaton background is
a quantum mechanics of n  n matrices. on the spacetime side, the d0
branes act as a source for the tachyon, and hence the spacetime background
around n d0 branes is a linear dilaton background with a nonzero cosmo-
logical constant. the analogue of the ads/cft conjecture would then state
that string theory in this background is holographically described by the
matrix quantum mechanics, which is the c=1 matrix model/liouville theory
correspondence. to make this precise, one needs a better understanding of
the world-volume action of the d0-branes and the role of the double scaling
limit in the spacetime geometry.

7 appendix

in section 2, we reviewed a construction of a boundary state preserving con-
formal invariance and based on a single conformal primary. in order to incor-
porate worldsheet supersymmetry we need to provide a slight generalization
of that construction.

suppose we are given isomorphic left and right chiral algebras, and left

and right primaries |li,|ri, such that:

|li = |ri

(13)

where  is the isomorphism between the chiral algebras. based on the module
of |li  |ri, one can build a boundary state satisfying

where t, t are any generators of the chiral algebra, and t is the image of
t under the action of .

the construction is identical to eq (2).

|bii = xi,j

ij li lj|hi
m 1

(15)

where here li , lj are products of modes of t, t respectively. mij is the
contravariant form, which is identical for the left and right moving algebras
since they are isomorphic.

in the case of n = 1 supersymmetry on the worldsheet, one has to con-
sider the supersymmetric extension of the conformal algebra: the ns algebra
or the r-algebra. in the nsns and the rr sector one can apply the above
construction and build a boundary state based on each superconformal pri-
mary 1.

1this can work in the r-ns sector only if the ns and r algebras are isomorphic, which
is the case when the theory is spacetime supersymmetric, and therefore has a n=2 algebra,
and a spectral ow operator which acts as an isomorphism of the ns and r sectors.

9

(t  t )|bi = 0

(14)

the boundary states |bin sn s and |birr have to be combined in a man-
ner ensuring a tachyon free open string sector. this is equivalent to imposing
a gso projection in the open string sector. prior to that, one has to apply
a gso projection to the boundary state (i.e.
in the closed string channel).
we now describe how to achieve that goal. for simplicity we concentrate on
the ns-ns sector.

the n = 1 superconformal algebra has an automorphism which reverses
the sign of the supercharges, leaving the bosonic generators intact. this
automorphism is used to perform the gso projection.

in order to construct a gso even boundary state one can build boundary

states |bi satisfying

(ln  ln)|bi = 0
(gr   gr)|bi = 0

(16)
(17)

where  = 1. the action of the gso projection on |bi is then given by
(18)
(19)

()fl|bi = sl|bi
()fr|bi = sr|bi

where sl, sr are the transformation properties of the primaries. the primary
has to be gso even to be physical, therefore we restrict to sl = sr = 1.
the gso invariant boundary state is then:

|bi = |bi  |bi

(20)

this boundary state couples then only to physical (gso-even) states.
