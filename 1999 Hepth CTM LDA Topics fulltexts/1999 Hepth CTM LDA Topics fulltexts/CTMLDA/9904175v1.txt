1 introduction

in string theory, the born-infeld action [1] arises as (part of) the low energy eective action of
open superstring theory [2, 3, 4, 5], and as (the bosonic part of) the eective actions for dp-
branes in type iia and iib theories [6]. in the rst context it is natural to look for a space-
time supersymmetrization [7, 8]. likewise, in the second case an ambient space-time global
supersymmetrization (accompanied by a local  symmetry) is the goal [9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
for certain ps superspace formulations also exist, e.g., [14, 15, 16, 17].

in this paper we try to combine the advantages of having a geometrical rst order formu-
lation involving an auxiliary metric with the advantage of having supersymmetry manifest.
this requires a world-volume superspace supergravity extension of the born-infeld action.
as the form of superspace supergravity is highly dimension dependent we do not expect to
nd a general prescription. below we restrict ourselves to p = 2. this case is also of interest
since d = 3 supergravity is non-dynamical and one might hope to retain some simplicity
even in the presence of the supergravity action.

we base our construction on a bosonic rst order action for arbitrary dp-branes. this
action has a generalized type of weyl invariance which reduces the number of degrees of
freedom in the auxiliary second rank tensor eld.
it would have been nice to be able to
extend this to a super-weyl invariance for the locally supersymmetric theory, and indeed we
nd a super-weyl invariant candidate action. unfortunately it leads to unwanted bosonic
terms, however.

the plan of the paper is as follows: in sec.2 we review some background mainly con-
cerning the spinning membrane. sec.3 introduces the new bosonic born-infeld action and
sec.4 presents d = 3 superspace along with our superspace actions. in sec.5 we give the
reduction of the superelds to components preparing for sec.6 where the component form of
the actions are given. sec.7, nally, contains our conclusions.

2 background

in [18] the following general weyl invariant action for p-branes was presented:

iw = z dp+1g(gmnmn)

p+1

2 ,

(1)

where x ,  = 0...., d  1 are coordinates in the d-dimensional (target) space-time,
m, m = 0, ..., p coordinatize the p-brane world volume, mn = mx nx g is the
world-volume metric induced from the space-time metric g and g is the determinant of

2

the auxiliary metric gmn.

for p = 1 the action (1) agrees with the usual string action with an auxiliary metric gmn

[19, 20]. coupling it to 2d supergravity in superspace leads to the spinning string:

i = z d2d2e1xx,

(2)

where all elds are superelds, e is the (super-)determinant of the supervielbein,  are the
spinorial covariant derivatives and we have suppressed the ambient space-time indices on x.

for p = 2 the action (1) agrees with the standard cosmological term action [21]

i = z d3g(gmnmn  1).

(3)

after eliminating gmn they both give the nambu-goto type action representing the volume
of the world-volume. however, whereas (3) is impossible to couple to 3d-supergravity [22],
this is not so for the p = 2 version of the action (1). in [23] it was shown that there exist
(at least) two dierent supersymmetrizations of (1) when p = 2. they read

i1 = z d3d2e1(xx)(xx)1/2,

and

(4)

(5)

i2 = z d3d2e1(ix

x)(ixx)(xx)1/2,

where again all elds are superelds and we have introduced 3d-superspace supergravity,
to be described in more detail below. in none of the actions (4) and (5) does the bosonic
weyl invariance extend to super-weyl invariance. however, in [23] it was found that the
combination i1  2

3i2 is in fact super-weyl invariant.

3 born-infeld actions

the born-infeld action

i bi

1 = tpz dp+1q det(mn + fmn)

(6)

is a direct generalization of the nambu-goto type action for p-branes by inclusion of the two-
form eld fmn. in the context of d-branes the brane tension tp is related to the fundamental
string tension ()1 and the string coupling constant gs, and

fmn  bmn + 2fmn,

(7)

with f = da the u(1) eld strength for the world-volume eld am and bmn the pull-
back to the world-volume of the kalb-ramond antisymmetric tensor eld. (there is also

3

a multiplicative exponent of a dilaton eld in the action which will play no role in our
considerations. we set it to 1 w.l.o.g.). in analogy to the p-brane case there is a rst order
action of the cosmological term type for the action (6), [18]. it is given by (c.f. (3)),

i bi

2 = tpz dp+1s [smn(mn + fmn) + (p  1)] ,

(8)
where smn() is a general tensor (it has no symmetry) and s  det smn. this form of the
action has been used in [24] as the starting point for a discussion of the strong coupling limit
of d-branes. the discussion was extended to include spin in that limit in [25]. however, the
same objections to a direct local supersymmetrization that were raised in [22] apply to the
action (8) for p = 2, since then (8) becomes (3) for f = 0 = s[mn]. we thus have to look for
an action analogous to (1) to use as a starting point. for p = 3 this was given in [18] and
for general p it is

i bi

3 = tpz dp+1s [smn(mn + fmn)]

p+1

2

.

(9)

it is easy to see that eliminating smn the action (6) is recovered1. furthermore we note that
the action (9) has a (generalized) weyl invariance and that it reduces to the action (1) in
the limit f = 0 = s[mn].

we now specialize to p = 2. since our goal is a locally supersymmetric superspace action
of the (4) or (5) type, we must reformulate (9) in terms of vielbeins. as a rst step in that
direction we separate the symmetric and antisymmetric part in smn according to

smn  gmn + mnphp/g.

(10)

it follows that s = g/1  h2, and the action (9) becomes, (properly normalized for

p = 2 and with tp set to one),

(12)

where a = 0, 1, 2 are tangent space indices and ab is the minkowski metric, we may rewrite
the action (11) as follows:

.

(13)

the independent elds are now x , am, em
a and ha. as a check, we have veried that (13) is
indeed equivalent to the 3d born-infeld action (6). the weyl invariance is now of the usual
type, i.e., a rescaling of ea

m with ha inert. this form is suitable for supersymmetrization.

1we are being careless with normalisation. for exact equivalence we should specify the p-dependent

numerical factors in front of the actions.

4

4 superspace

we will use the 3d superspace conventions of [26]. the supergravity algebra is given by

{,} = 2i,
2
u = ir + i
3

(r)m 

[,] = c(u),
 m 
 ,

 + ig 

(14)

where m are lorentz generators and r and g are the basic superelds that solve the
bianchi identities (g is completely symmetric in all three spinor indices.). in this nota-
tion a vector index is represented by a symmetrized pair of spinor indices. the covariant
derivatives have the usual structure a = em
a being the supervielbein,
dm the at superspace covariant derivatives and a the connection. the matter superelds
that we will consider are x (, ) whose -independent part is the space-time coordinate and
h which is a spinor supereld whose covariant derivative h = 1
2(h) has the bosonic
vector ha as lowest component. finally, the dual of the maxwell eld-strength2 is the lowest
component of f = 1

a dm +am with em

2(w), with w the electromagnetic spinor potential.

with the above ingredients we immediately write down two possible generalizations of

(4) and (5):

and

where

i1 = z d3d2e1(1  h 2)1/2(xx + h w)s1/2,

i2 = z d3d2e1(1  h 2)1/2s1/2,

s  (xx + h f),
  (ixx + h 

 w), h 2  h h.

(15)

(16)

(17)

these actions reduce to (4) and (5) when h = 0, and in the next section we show that
the bosonic parts of both (15) and (16) are equivalent to the action (13). before going to
components let us look at (possible) super-weyl invariance [27]. under an innitesimal super
weyl transformation with parameter  the superelds transform as follows:

e = e,
h = h,
w = 3w,

e = 2e  i(e()e)  e1 = 4e1,
h = 0,
f = 4f + 2(e()w),

where we have used that [26]

2from now on we put the background b-eld to zero.

w   + 2r,

5

(18)

(19)

and that

 = ,

r = 2r  22,

 = (e()c) + .

(20)

the transformation of h was determined from the requirement that ha = 0, in agreement
with the discussion in sec.3.

the diculty in nding an invariant action is entirely due to the inhomogeneous parts
of the transformations in (18). we nd the following super-weyl invariant combination of
the actions in (15) and (16):

iw = i1  2

(21)
where i1 indicates that we have replaced (xx + h w)  (xx) in the la-
grangian. as will be seen in sec.6, the action iw in (21) has a bosonic part that diers from
the action in (13). it does however reduce to the super-weyl invariant combination of (4)
and (5) when h = 0.

3 i2,

5 components

there is a systematic procedure for deriving the components, the component action and the
component local supersymmetry transformations of a theory in superspace. it is described
in [26] for d = 4 supergravity actions. for the case at hand we use the denitions and
results in [23] to which we add those pertaining to the h and w elds. we dene

note that the explicit dependence on s in 2h is canceled by the s-terms in g and .
h is thus independent of s, in agreement with the fact that it does not transform under

6 component actions

having dened the components and derived the relations in (22) -(27), we are in a position
to nd the component actions from (15) and (16) . we use the 3d density formula derived
in [23]:

z d3d2e1l = z d3e1h(cid:16)2 + i

 + 2s +  

(  

) (cid:17)li|.

(29)

we rst want to establish the equivalence of the bosonic parts of (15) and (16) to (13).
the bosonic contents of the actions simply follow from taking the bosonic part of the rst
term on the right hand side of (29)4. we thus nd for the action in (15)

1  h2 h  2t 2i 
4since the pure bose part of l is zero, the s-term will not contribute.

where  is the bosonic part of s, dened in (17), i.e., it is the factor which is raised to 3/2
in the action (13). obviously, integrating out the auxiliary eld t , we recover the action
(13).

the action in (16) is a little more challenging. it gives, (keeping the spinor notation),

(cid:17)i 1/2,

(31)

where dot denotes contraction over the ambient spacetime indices. it is a remarkable fact,
manifest in (31), that integrating out the auxiliary eld t we again recover the action (13).
from the expressions (30) and (31) we may also read o the t equations that result from

the super-weyl invariant action i1  2

we note that for w = 0 the fact that m is non-degenerate ensures that t  = 0 and
thus that the correct bosonic action results in that case. for w 6= 0 the equation (33) is still
solvable, the solution being expressed in the inverse m1 of the three by three matrix. it
is clear, though, that the resulting action will be rather complicated and contain unwanted
bosonic terms. for this reason we have not calculated it explicitly.

the component version of the super-weyl invariant combination (21) can be reassembled
from (35) and (36) (omitting the terms from h w). the super-weyl invariance should
manifest itself in an independence of s. we have only checked the quadratic s-terms which
indeed cancel.

7 discussions and conclusions

we have studied a rst order weyl invariant bosonic action for dp-branes for the special
case of p = 2 and shown how it can be coupled to 3d supergravity in (at least) two dierent
ways. we have further derived the component content of the model, both for the actions
and the local supersymmetry transformations. our results generalize those for the spinning
membrane, except when it comes to super-weyl invariance. the super-weyl invariant action
we nd does indeed reduce to that of the spinning membrane when we turn o the world-
volume maxwell elds, but it does not have the correct bosonic limit when they are non-
zero. although we have not been able to nd one, we see no reason why another super-weyl
invariant action with the correct limit should not exist. to construct it one would have to
have some additional guideline, however.

an interesting question is of course whether the present construction generalizes to any
other p. many of the features we encountered in the above constructions are three dimen-
sional. e.g., the fact that we were able to reduce sab  ea, ha is based on the 3d equivalence
of a vector and an antisymmetric tensor. for higher p we typically have hab instead of ha
and we thus expect the potential to have spin 3/2 instead of spin 1/2. the form of the su-
perspace action will have to change because of the growth of the superspace measure. there
is also the question of which multiplets to use. all in all, it looks as if each case has to be
considered separately.

one of the perhaps unwanted features of the bosonic starting point is the non-linearity
in (9). usually, going from a nambu-goto type action to an action with an auxiliary metric

11

leads to a quadratic behaviour in the path integral (after gauge xing). this is not the
case here, although we replace a square root of a determinant by powers of x. further
linearization may formally be achieved by introducing additional auxiliary elds and lagrange
multipliers, but does not really seem very useful.

as far as we know, locally supersymmetric extensions of the born-infeld action have not
been discussed previously. however, several globally (world volume) supersymmetric models
in various dimensional superspaces exist. e.g., [7, 8, 14, 15] (p = 3, n = 1) and [15, 16, 17]
(p = 5, n = 1 and p = 3, n = 2). it would be interesting to compare the present models
with the globally supersymmetric d2-brane.

as mentioned in the introduction, the motivation for studying the globally supersymmet-
ric extensions of the bi-action is usually either taken to be its appearence in the eective
action of the 10d open superstring or its role in the d-brane eective action. in both these
cases it is also interesting to investigate the possible existence of locally supersymmetric
extensions, and the present results is a rst contribution to this.
