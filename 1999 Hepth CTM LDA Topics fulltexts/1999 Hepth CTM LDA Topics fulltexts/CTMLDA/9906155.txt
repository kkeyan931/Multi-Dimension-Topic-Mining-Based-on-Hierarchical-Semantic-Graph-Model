(2) (3) (4) 2 =pd2/4 + m2 g(x, y) standard greens function satisfying (cid:0)dd m2(cid:1) g(x, y) = (x y) . pg(x) free eld solution lower sign exists classically < d/2, unitary bound restricts < 1 . functions f f+ called regular irregular boundary values conformal elds scaling dimensions d/2 d/2 + , respectively. ads/cft correspondence elds obeying regular boundary conditions give rise cft correlation functions operators conformal dimensions restricted d/2. hence, use irregular boundary conditions enables one obtain correlation functions operators scaling dimensions d/2 1 < < d/2. (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) 2 regular boundary conditions let us start rewriting expression (4) (x) = (0)(x) +z dx g(x, y)b(y), greens function g(x) given  f hypergeometric function, g(x, y) = (x0y0) = c 2 ( = 1 2x0y0 (cid:26) 1 x0 < y0, x0 > y0, ddk i(ky0)k(kx0) (2)d eik(xy)(i(kx0)k(ky0) 2 z 2 +)f (cid:0)d/2, d/2 + ; 1 + ; 2(cid:1) , 2(cid:2)(x y)2 + (x y)2(cid:3) +p(x y)2(x y)2(cid:27) (y denotes vector (y0, y)), c = (d/2 + ) d/2(1 + ) . moreover, free eld solution (0) shall written (0)(x) =z ddy k(x, y)(0) (y) =z ddy k(x, y)(0) + (y). bulk-boundary propagators occuring equation (10) given k(x, y) = c(cid:20) x0 (x y)2(cid:21) 2 , c given equation (9), fourier transforms read k(x, k) = 2 (1 ) eikx(cid:18) k 2(cid:19) x 2 0 k(kx0). 3 equations (12) (10) imply boundary functions (0) + (0) related (0) + (k) = (1 ) (1 + )(cid:18) k 2(cid:19)2 (0) (k). (13) obviously, free eld (0) written sum two series, whose leading powers , respectively. thus, one nds direct comparison equations (10) (12) xd/2+ xd/2 0 small x0 behaviour (0) 0 (0)(x) x00 x 2 0 (0) (x) + x 2 + 0 (0) + (x), subleading terms dropped. moreover, greens function (8) goes like g(x, y) x00 1 2 2 + 0 k(x, y). x (14) (15) hence, interaction contributes + part asymptotic boundary behaviour, i.e. one write (x) x00 x 2 0 (x) + x 2 + 0 +(x), (x), (x) = (0) +(x) = (0) + (x) 1 2z dy k(x, y)b(y). (16) (17) (18) identical relations hold fourier transformed expressions. consider on-shell action, treated functional regular boundary values . integrating equation (1) parts yields = 1 2z ddx xd 0 n 1 2z dx (x)b(x) + iint. rst term must regularized, done writing xd 0 n = xd 2 2 0 0 (cid:20)(cid:18)d 0 (cid:18) +(cid:18) (cid:19) x (cid:19) 2 2+ + , 2 2 = xd + (cid:19) x 2 + 0 + + (cid:21) ellipses indicate contributions subleading terms terms vanish x0 = 0. rst term last line cancelled covariant counterterm. hence, renormalized on-shell action i = z ddk (2)d (k)+(k) 1 2z dx (x)b(x) + iint = (0) 1 2z dx dy b(x)g(x, y)b(y) + iint, (19) 4 equations (18), (17), (13), (6) (10) used. term (0) equation (19) given (0) = (1 ) (1 + )z = 2cz ddx ddy ddk (2)d (cid:18) k 2(cid:19)2 (x)(y) |x y|d+2 (k)(k) (20) thus yields correct two point function scalar operators conformal dimension = d/2 + , one uses ads/cft correspondence formula ei =(cid:28)exp(cid:20)z ddx o(x)(x)(cid:21)(cid:29) . (21) two terms expressed perturbative series terms (0). however, virtue equations (10) (17) naturally yields perturbative series terms boundary function . 3 irregular boundary conditions treatment irregular boundary conditions follows idea klebanov witten {$9905104$}. con- sider expression i (k) = 2 (1 ) (1 + )(cid:18) k z dx dy dz 2(cid:19)2 (k) +z 2iint (x)(z) g(x, y)b(y) dx b(x) (x) (k) (z) (k) . using equation (13) formula (x) (k) = k(x, k) +z dy dz g(x, y) 2iint (y)(z) (z) (k) , one nds i (k) = 2(0) + (k) +z dx k(x, k)b(x) = 2+(k), or, inverse fourier transformation, i (x) = 2+(x) (22) expression holds order perturbation theory. fact obtained {$9905104$} using graph arguments. furthermore, shows rst + regarded conjugate eld secondly functional j = i + 2z ddx (x)+(x) (23) minimum respect variation . 5 klebanov wittens idea {$9905104$} formulate ads/cft correspondence formula ej =(cid:28)exp(cid:20)z ddx o(x)+(x)(cid:21)(cid:29) . (24) here, functional j legendre transform action i, i.e. minimum value expression (23), expressed terms +. following, klebanov wittens result correctness two point function {$9905104$} shall conrmed interactions included. minimum j easiest found equations (19) (23), giving j = z 1 2z 2(cid:19)2 ddk ddk (2)d (k)+(k) (2)d (cid:18) k (1 + ) (1 )z 2z ddx z (1 )z (2)d (cid:18) k (1 + ) ddk 1 2(cid:19)2 = + = dy k(y, x)+(x)b(y) 1 4z ddz z dx (x)b(x) + iint +(k)+(k) +(k)+(k) 1 2z 1 2z dx (x)b(x) + iint dx dy b(x)g(x, y)b(y) + iint dx dy k(x, z)k(y, z)b(x)b(y). (25) equations (17), (13), (18), (12) (6) used. rst term equation (25) inversely fourier transformed, yields j (0) = 2cz ddx ddy +(x)+(y) |x y|d2 . (26) according correspondence formula (24), yields correct two point function conformal operators scaling dimension = d/2 . then, second fourth term equation (25) combined dening greens function g(x, y) = g(x, y) + 1 2z ddz k(x, z)k(y, z). (27) modied greens function g also satises equation (5), second term equation (27) contribute discontinuity. moreover, using equations (7) (12) one nds g(x, y) = (x0y0) ddk (2)d eik(xy) 2 z " 2k(kx0)k(ky0) ()(1 ) +(k(ky0)i(kx0) k(kx0)i(ky0) x0 < y0, x0 > y0,# = (x0y0) 2 z ddk (2)d eik(xy)(k(ky0)i(kx0) k(kx0)i(ky0) x0 < y0, x0 > y0, diers equation (7) interchanging . hence, result (8) taken over, yielding g(x, y) = c 2 ( 2 ) f (cid:0)d/2, d/2 ; 1 ; 2(cid:1) . (28) 6 thus, inserting equation (27) equation (25) yields j = j (0) 1 2z dx dy b(x) g(x, y)b(y) + iint. moreover, one see equation (28) small x0 g behaves g(x, y) x00 1 2 2 0 k(x, y). x hence, writing (x) =z ddy k(x, y)+(y) +z dy g(x, y)b(y), (29) (30) (31) interaction contributes . turn means that, expressing iint b perturbative series using equation (31), functional j naturally expressed terms irregular boundary value +. moreover, expected form, obtained equation (19) replacing +. important point greens function g must used calculation internal lines. finally, calculation similar derivation equation (22) one nds j +(x) = 2(x). (32) nal conrmation fact elds + conjugate other. conclusion, expanded klebanov wittens recent idea formulating ads/cft correspondence using irregular boundary conditions, showing give expected answers order perturbation theory. acknowledgments work supported part grant nserc. w. m. grateful simon fraser university nancial support.
