abstract

we consider the ads space formulation of the classical dynamics deriving
from the stuckelberg lagrangian. the on-shell action is shown to be free of
infrared singularities as the vector boson mass tends to zero. in this limit the
model becomes maxwell theory formulated in an arbitrary covariant gauge.
then we use the ads/cft correspondence to compute the two-point cor-
relation functions on the boundary. it is shown that the gauge dependence
concentrates on the contact terms while the non-trivial part of the confor-
mal theory correlators turns out to be that already found by working in a
completely xed gauge.

as it is well known [1], maldacena has conjectured that the large n limit of a certain
conformal eld theory (cft) in a d-dimensional space can be described by string/m-theory
on adsd+1  k, where k is a suitable compact space. a precise form to this conjecture has
been given in refs. [2,3] according to which

zads[0] = z0 d exp(i[])  zcf t [0] = hexp(cid:18)z

ddxo0(cid:19)i ,

(1)

where 0 is the value taken by  at the boundary. by assumption 0 is also the external cur-
rent coupling to the operator o in the boundary cft. thus the knowledge of the partition
function in adsd+1 enables one to obtain the correlation functions of the boundary cft in d
dimensions. the ads/cft correspondence has been studied for scalar elds [37], massive
vector elds [8,9], spinor elds [8,10,11], the rarita-schwinger eld [1214], classical gravity
[15,16], massive symmetric tensor elds [17], antisymmetric p-form elds [18,19], type iib
string theory [20,21] and three dimensional eld theories with chern-simons terms [22].

the ads/cft correspondence is an example of the holographic principle [23] according
to which a quantum theory with gravity must be describable by a boundary theory. this
raises questions on how the detailed information of the theory in the bulk can be com-
pletely coded in a lower dimensional theory at the border. in fact this mechanism is still
not well understood and several aspects of it have recently been investigated. for instance,
the holographic bound, establishing that the boundary theory has only one bit of informa-
tion per planck area, manifests itself in the infrared-ultraviolet connection of the ads/cft
correspondence [24]. some situations involving superluminal oscillations and negative en-
ergy density have shown that there are hidden degrees of freedom which store information
but have no local energy density [25]. on more conservative grounds, known relationships
between eld theories in the bulk should emerge in the conformal theory at the boundary.
this has been veried explicitly for the case ads3/cf t2. in fact, the well known equiv-
alence between maxwell-chern-simons theory and the self-dual model in minkowski space
also holds in ads3 and, correspondingly, both models have been shown to lead to the same
conformal theory at the border [22].

another aspect of the holographic principle regards the gauge degrees of freedom of
the bulk theory. if the bulk theory is a gauge theory the gauge degrees of freedom must be
somehow codied at the border. since the correlators of the corresponding conformal theory
have conserved sources they do not carry information about de longitudinal modes of the
gauge eld. apparently there is no information about the gauge degrees of freedom at the
border.

for the abelian gauge eld the corresponding conformal correlators were found in [3] by
evaluating the rst term in the equality (1). the present work is dedicated to study the
gauge dependence of this result. we shall demonstrate that the gauge degrees of freedom
only contribute to the contact terms which appear in the on-shell action and are usually
ignored when computing the correlators of the theory at the border.

thus we shall be looking for a formulation of electrodynamics in an arbitrary gauge when
the space-time background is adsd+1. as in the case of at minkowski space it will prove
convenient to start from the stuckelberg action

where f = a  a,  is the covariant derivative and a is a real positive constant.
electrodynamics in an arbitrary covariant gauge, specied by the constant a, is dened as
the limit m2  0 of stuckelberg theory. on the other hand the limit a  , while keeping
m2 > 0, results in the proca theory. the mass term in (2) will help us to control the infrared
divergent terms which will arise along the calculation.

as usual we take the representation of adsd+1 in poincare coordinates which describes

the half-space x0 > 0, xi  rd with the metric

where l  gga.
before going on a digression is in order. since we are going to solve the equations
of motion subjected to dirichlet boundary conditions some care must be exercised when
applying the variational principle to the action (2). when we vary the action to obtain the
equations of motion the boundary term

z ddx g(cid:18)f 0iai +

1

aaa0(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=

(5)

is generated. if the gauge xing term is not present then the boundary conditions must be
prescribed only for the spatial components of the potential ai. in the present case, however,
all components of the potential must be given at the border. then no additional bound-
ary terms are needed in the original action to cancel the one coming from the variational
principle.

after this clarication we return to our main line of development. the solving of the

equations of motion is greatly simplied by the decomposition of a into a scalar eld 

and a vector eld u 

  a ,

these new elds satisfy, respectively, the equations of motion

as can be veried by using (4). here u  u  u. clearly u  is a proca eld with

been presented in the literature [4,8] and read, respectively,

as usual, we shall look for a solution written in terms of boundary eld values specied

which, as expected, reproduce the results found in ref. [8] for the proca eld.

in this paper we are interested in maxwell theory formulated in an arbitrary covariant
gauge. therefore we must investigate the limit m2  0 of (1925). from eqs.(14a) and
(14b) one nds, respectively, that the expansions

are valid up to terms of order m2. then from eqs.(17), (26) and (27) it follows that d(k)
vanishes as m2 goes to zero. in fact, it is straightforward to show that

which also vanishes as m2  0. therefore, wj/am2, w/am2, zj, z, x ii
i become
singular as m2  0, while x i
remain nite (see eqs.(22-25)). this implies that
/am2 and u develop infrared divergences. the question is now whether a is well dened
in the zero mass limit. to investigate this point we go back with eqs.(19-21) into eq.(7)

where o(m2) denotes terms of order m2 or higher. clearly, o(m2) cancels out the divergence
arising from 1/d(k) (see eq.(36)) leaving us with a nite expression. for arriving at this
result we have used the fact that for small m2,

which can easily be corroborated (see eqs.(17) and (34)). through a similar analysis we
show that the third line in eq.(38) and the second and third lines in eq.(39) dene functions
of m2 which are regular at m2 = 0. to summarize, a(x) is indeed an analytic function of
m2 in the vicinity of m2 = 0.

we turn next into application of the ads/cft correspondence to compute the two-point
correlation function < o(~x)o(~y) > of the boundary cft. the dominant term in the path
integral in eq.(1) is the exponential of the classical action evaluated on-shell. after using
eqs.(2) and (4) one nds that

(42)

where f0i(x)  0 ai(x)  i a0(x) and  is the near-boundary surface x0 = . the explicit
dependence of is on the gauge parameter a should be noticed. non trivial eld theory
correlators may only arise from those terms containing f,0i(~x) and  a0(x)/x0|x0=. we
shall therefore concentrate our attention on these objects.

from (38) and (39) and after setting x0 =  one obtains

where the argument k of the modied bessel functions has been omitted in order to simplify
the notation. the rst two lines in the right hand side of (43) survive in the limit a  
and reproduce, as it must be the case, the result for the proca eld tensor [8]. furthermore
the dangerous infrared behavior of d, showing up in the denominator of the last line of (43),
is again canceled by the factor  + 1  d/2 in the corresponding numerator, leaving us with
an overall function f,0i(~x) regular at m2 = 0.

since (a  d
2) and d are o(m2) the second term in the rst bracket of eq.(44) is o(m2)
and, therefore, it drops out in the zero mass limit. for the same reasons the term involving
1/d in the second bracket of (44) is regular in m2 = 0 which renders  a0(x)/x0|x0= free
of infrared divergences.
we shall next determine the contributions of each term in (43) and (44) to the action in
(42) and, therefore, to the correlators < o(~x)o(~y) >. we shall do this for m2 > 0, the
limit m2  0 being taken at the very end of the calculations.

eld o is in the present case a0,(~x)  a(x0 = 0, ~x). therefore we must perform the limit
  0 in (50). however such limit only becomes operational after prescribing a relationship
relating a,(~x) with the value of the eld on the boundary surface x0 = 0 . we then identify

which, as expected, reproduces the normalization prescription for the proca eld [8]. then
by taking into account the normalization in eq.(51) and using the ads/cft correspondence

at the level of the action the leading powers of  are, correspondingly, 2 +2d and 2a+1d,
as seen from (42). by its turn the two-point cft correlator incorporates the extra power
2( d) arising from (51) and its leading terms, other than contact terms, turn out to
be either proportional to 2 +2d2( d) or to 2a+1d2( d). after taking into account
eq.(18) one obtains for the gauge independent power

while for the gauge dependent one eqs.(14) and (18) lead to

a similar analysis reveals that this time the leading terms are either proportional to
2 +1d2( d) or to 2a+1d2( d). the gauge dependent power vanishes again as in-
dicated in (62) while the gauge independent one vanishes linearly with . indeed,

as implied by eq.(18).

summarizing, the third line in the right hand side of eq.(43) only makes trivial contribu-
tions to the two-point cft correlator. thus if < o(~x)o(~y) > contains at all a nontrivial
gauge dependent piece it can only originate in the last term of the right hand side of eq.(44)
which, as we already said, survives in the limit m2  0. we now turn into the analysis of
such term, hereafter to be referred to as i (0), i.e.,

i (0)(~x) = z ddy a,0(~y) i (00)(~x, ~y)

by using eqs.(17), (26), (27) and (56) it can be veried that at the limit   0 the following

we emphasize a common feature of the expansions (67) and (68), namely, both of them
have g0 as the coecient of the power 2 . this is at the root of the absence of gauge
dependent terms in < o(~x)o(~y) > because it implies that

in words, all potentially dangerous powers 2 1 cancel out among themselves leaving 2 +1
and 2a as the leading powers in the expansion of the integrand in eq.(66). as indicated
in eqs.(61) and (62) these powers do not contribute to < o(~x)o(~y) > in the limit   0.
we then conclude that the gauge dependence concentrates on the contact terms while the
non-trivial part of the boundary conformal theory correlators turns out to be that already
found by working in a completely xed gauge [3,5] and displayed in eq.(53). another
important feature is that although we have xed all components of the potential at the
border the pieces containing a,0 give only contact terms and the only non-trivial pieces are
those containing a,i. therefore the boundary theory still retains information on the gauge
degrees of freedom of the bulk theory. this then lends further support to the holographic
principle.
