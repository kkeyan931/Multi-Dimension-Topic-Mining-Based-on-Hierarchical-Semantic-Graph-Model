(1) term generated one-loop order perturbation theory  two-loop correction shown vanish . abelian theories, corrections higher loops . widely believed true even nonabelian theories, although rigorous proof given. expectation based topological nature chern-simons term. nonabelian theories, term invariant large gauge transformations, consequently coecient must quantized obtain consistent quantum theories. corrections higher loops, would necessarily spoil quantized nature coupling. another circumstantial evidence non-renormalization -function chern- simons coupling vanishes orders perturbation

non-perturbative large gauge transformations argument cannot apply abelian theories. proof given next section apply abelian nonabelian theories relies gauge in- variance small gauge transformations. furthermore, proof apply wider 1 class gauge theories discussed coleman hill . authors proved non-renormalization theorem chern-simons coupling class minimally coupled gauge theories, gauge

organized follows: section 2, background recent devel- opments supersymmetric theories explained simple proof non-renormalization theorem given. section 3, several remarks made. 2 proof consider

term application works dine  weinberg , simple proof non-renormalization  fayet-iliopoulos u(1)d-term  given general supersymmetric gauge theories. key technical tool used proof seiberg trick  regarding coupling parameters scalar components external superelds. following approach dine weinberg, regard couplings action (2) external scalar elds.4 suppose chern-simons term (1) generated

presented simple (rather trivial) proof non-renormalization theorem chern-simons coupling 2 + 1-dimensional gauge theories without bare chern- simons coupling. results given letter already known new: abelian theories, proof apply wider class gauge- invariant theories considered coleman-hill , gauge interactions restricted minimal coupling. nonabelian theories, results new proof revealed small gauge invariance enough ensure absence higher order corrections. need require large gauge invariance all. started general gauge theories without bare chern-simons coupling. 4 precisely speaking, regard gauge coupling coecients interaction terms g external scalar elds. mass parameters remain constants. 3 bare chern-simons term present, proof could apply case. chern-simons term (1) would gauge-invariant bare chern-simons coupling regarded scalar eld. abelian theories, problem remedied still keeping constant absorbing gauge eld propagator. not, however, work nonabelian theories nonabelian chern-simons term includes interaction term. although know whether proof generalized case, may unreasonable expect similar proof could work yang-mills-chern-simons gauge theories higher order corrections chern-simons coupling proved pure nonabelian chern-simons gauge theories . mentioned section 2, crucial, proof, take convention gauge coupling appear covariant derivative. one might expect proof given previous section could hold conventions gauge coupling, example, canonical normalization, eq.(2) may replaced ga. not, however, case canonical normalization gauge kinetic term would break gauge invariance think gauge coupling scalar eld. furthermore, rescaling eld, ga, cause another problem functional measure may invariant rescaling chern-simons term could generated integration measure {$9707133$}. would interest clarify relation dierent conventions gauge coupling. may instructive make comment proof tells us chern- simons term (1) generated one-loop forbid appearance would chern-simons terms eective action . example, term fd, manifestly gauge-invariant may generated higher loops, may reduce chern-simons term replacing expectation value < > higgs phase. nal remark follows: previous section, insisted in- duced chern-simons coupling must independent coupling parameters. true even non-perturbatively long gauge symmetry preserved wilsonian eective action. concluded, fact, radiative corrections chern-simons coupling come one-loop diagrams generated action g = 0 eq.(2). conclusion true long couplings treated perturbatively true even non-perturbatively? moment, def- inite answer question. requirement gauge invariance would forbid induced chern-simons coupling, example, function /|| coupling parameter , since /|| looks like constant long restricted positive (or negative). fact, dependence known appear one-loop 4 = fermion masses bare chern-simons coupling. since mass parameters incorporated propagators treated perturbatively, may sug- gest locally-constant function couplings, contradict gauge invariance, could appear non-perturbatively. would great interest generalize perturbative non-renormalization theorem non-perturbative one.
