abstract

a 3d topological sigma model describing maps from a 3-manifold y to a calabi-
yau 3-fold m is introduced. as the model is topological, we can choose an arbitrary
metric on m . upon scaling up the metric, the path integral by construction localizes
on the moduli space of special lagrangian submanifolds of m . we couple the theory
to dynamical gauge elds and discuss the case where m has a mirror and the gauge
group is u (1).

1 introduction

two dimensional topological sigma models [1] have found many interesting applications both
in physics and mathematics. in string theory, for example, the eective eld theory of curved
d3-branes wrapped around holomorphically embedded 2-cycles in a hyper kahler manifold,
in a limit where the cycle shrinks to zero size, turns out to be a 2d topological sigma model
[2]. this eective eld theory has then been used to study the existence of bound states of
d-branes. from the mathematical point of view, topological sigma models have provided
an alternative formulation of floer groups and jones polynomials in knot theory. as in
the case of donaldson theory, where physical reformulation [3] has been very useful and
enlightening, specially in the analysis and determination of donaldson invariants [4, 5], one
may also hope that the reformulation of floer groups and jones polynomials in terms of a
topological quantum eld theory shed light on the structure of these topological invariants.
the sigma model constructed in [1] (the a-model [6]) is a theory of maps x :   m ,
where  is a riemann surface and m a complex manifold. the topological structure of the
model allows one to choose an arbitrary metric on m. when the metric is scaled up, it can
be seen that the dominent contributions to the path integral come from the holomorphic
maps satisfying

zx = 0 ,

where z, z are complex coordinates on , and ,  indicate the complex tangent indices on
m.

interestingly, the holomorphicity condition (1) also appears in the study of d-branes
wrapping around riemann surfaces embedded in m. roughly speaking, type ii string theory
compactied on r6  m, m being a hyper kahler manifold, has bps states in the form of
d3-branes wrapping around s1  .  is embedded in m through x, so x is part of the
brane coordinates in the ambient space. one can see that these solitonic states in general
break the supersymmetry of the underlying superstring theory unless the embedding maps
are holomorphic and the u(1) connection (being part of the low energy degrees of freedom)
is at.

considering d3-branes wrapping around 3-cycles in a calabi-yau 3-fold m and demand-
ing supersymmetry leads to some new constraints known as the special lagrangian subman-
ifold conditions [7, 8]

xk = 0 , x(im ) = 0 .

(2)

here x is an embedding of a 3-manifold y to m. k and  represent the kahler and
holomorphic 3-form on m, respectively, and  indicates the pull-back operation. the 3-
cycles satisfying eqs. (2) are sometimes called supersymmetric 3-cycles.
now taking eqs. (2) as the corresponding equations to (1) in 3 dimensions, it is interesting
to see whether the above 2-dimensional sigma model can be generalized to 3 dimensions. if
such, then the path integral of the corresponding sigma model, in some scaling limit of the
parameters entering the lagrangian, would localize on the moduli space of solutions to (2).
as in two dimensions, one may expect that the eective low energy description of curved
d5-branes wrapping around s1s1y , where y is a supersymmetric 3-cycle in m shrinking
to zero size, is given by a 3d topological sigma model of above type.
this paper is organized as follows. to begin with, in section 2 we take equations (2) as
the starting point for the construction of a 3-dimensional topological sigma model. apart
from the bosonic elds x, we introduce some fermionic elds needed to dene a brst-
like symmetry. having had the equations and brst symmetry, we proceed to construct
a lagrangian which is brst trivial. next we discuss the moduli space of solutions to (2)
where the dominent contributions to the path integral come from. in section 3, we couple
the theory to dynamical gauge elds. as in [1], a consistent coupling to the gauge elds
requires a modication of the brst transformation rules. the lagrangian describing the
dynamics of gauge multiplet is then obtained by dimensional reduction of the lagrangian of
twisted n = 2 sym in four dimensions. the case where the gauge group is u(1) and the

the xed point equations, in this case, turns out to be parametrized by the mirror manifold

target manifold m has a mirror fm is of particular interest. the moduli space of solutions to
fm . at the end, we have collected the convensions and some derivations in an appendix.

2 a topological sigma model

in this section we aim to construct a topological sigma model of maps x : y  m, which
has the special lagrangian conditions (2) as its xed point equations. let us indicate the

2

indices on y by i, j, . . ., and those on m by , , . . .. it will prove convenient, if instead of
(2), we consider the equations s = kij = 0, with

s = 1 +

kij = x 

1
3!h
i x 

j k ,

ijkx 

i x 

j x 

k 

where we have dened x 

i  ix , and h indicates the determinant of the induced metric;

h = det hij =

1
3!{ijkmnlhimhjnhkl} = det (ix jx g) .

as we are describing the theory on the embedded 3-manifold, in the following, we always use
the induced metric to raise or lower the indices on y . the prescription for the construction
of the lagrangian is now as follows.

first we introduce a ghost eld , the fermionic partner of x , and the brst operator

 with an action

x  = i  ,  = 0 ,

(3)

where  is a constant anticommuting parameter.  is a section of x(t ), with t the tangent
bundle of m. further we need to introduce an anti-ghost eld , an anti-ghost two-form
ij (the conjugate elds to s and kij), as well as a scalar eld h and a two-form hij. the
transformation laws are now dened to be

(h1/4) =  h1/4h , (h1/4h) = 0
, (h1/4h j
(h1/4 j

i ) =  h1/4h j

i

i ) = 0 .

(4)

let us dene the operator q by  = i{q, }, for any eld . we would like the
lagrangian to be a brst commutator, i.e. l = i{q, }, for some gauge fermion . a
minimal choice for  is

 =

1
4

h ( h +  h + ijh ij  2 s  2s  2ij kij) ,

(5)

where  is an arbitrary real parameter. the action now reads

s = iz {q, } =

  ih1/4

1
2
(h1/4s)

x 

hijh ij + hij kij

  ih1/4 j

i

(h1/4hikkkj)

x 

# .

the auxiliary elds h and hij have no dynamics and can be integrated out using their

equations of motion. doing this, the bosonic part of the action becomes

recall that the action was dened to be a brst commutator. therefore the path integral
 upon assuming that the measure is also invariant under the brst transformations  is
independent of the parameter  as well as the metric on m (or more generally independent
of any data entering ). hence, in computing the path integral, an arbitrary and convenient
value for these parameters can be chosen. for instance, we may take the limit   0. or
equivalently, we may scale the metric as g  tg for t a real parameter, and then take
the limit t  . in both limits, the path integral will localize around the solutions of the
following equations

h +

ijkx 

i x

k ( + ) = 0 .

by eq. (6), this is equivalent to eqs. (2) dening the special lagrangian submanifolds of
m. let us indicate the moduli space of solutions to these equations by msl and study the
tangent space at y .

the tangent space to msl
let x  describe a special lagrangian submanifold of m. we deform x  to a nearby map
x  + x , and ask under what conditions this new map is still a special lagrangian sub-
manifold. for x  not to have any component obtainable by a dieomorphism on y , we
demand that x  belong to the normal bundle at y , i.e.,

gix x  = 0 .

to nd the tangent space to msl at y , we impose the special lagrangian conditions
(im s = kij = 0) on x  + x . following the same line of arguments as in (8), for the
lagrangian condition (i.e., kij = 0) we get

0 = [i(x )x 

j]k = i(x 

j x k)  j(x 

i x k)  ij  ji ,

(11)

where i  x x 
i k. as the pull-back of the kahelr form is zero, the complex structure
provides an isomorphism between the tangent space, ty m, and the normal space, ny m at
y . as such, j 
x  is a tangent vector at y . contracting this vector with the metric and
pulling it back gives a one-form on y . hence, i is a one-form on y .

the implication of the special lagrangian condition can be seen more easily by writing

the kahler form and  in the vielbein bases (here n = 3),

k = e1  en+1 + e2  en+2 + e3  en+3

 = (e1 + ien+1)  (e2 + ien+2)  (e3 + ien+3) ,

or in components

k = ea

 = abc(ea + ien+a)(eb + ien+b)(ec + ien+c) ,

equations (11) and (15) imply that for the map x  + x  to be a special lagrangian
submanifold of m, the one-form i = x x 
i k must be closed and coclosed [10, 11].
therefore any harmonic one-form  on y species a direction in which a special lagrangian
submanifold can be deformed in msl, and the dimension of msl equals b1, the rst betti
number of the manifold y . looking back to (10) shows that, in the background of an
x  describing a special lagrangian submanifold of m, zero modes of  satisfy the same
equations that x  does in (11) and (15). consequently, if b1 > 0, there exist  zero modes
and the partition function identically vanishes. to soak up the zero modes, while maintaining
the topological characteristic of the theory, we need to insert some brst invariant operators
with the right ghost number in to the path integral. this leads us to look for the cohomology
classes of the operator q. following [1], these cohomology classes can be constructed and
be shown that are in correspondence with the de rham cohomology classes of m.

3 coupling to gauge elds

we would like now to couple the sigma model of the previous section to dynamical gauge
elds of a compact gauge group g. as in [1], g is taken to be the group of automorphisms of
m preserving all the structures on the manifold. the g action on m is through the vector
elds va = v 
a e, a = 1, . . . , n (n is the dimension of g), representing the group generators,
i.e.,

[va, vb] = f c

ab vc ,

for fabc the structure constants of g. the fact that the g action preserves all the structures
on m means that the lie derivatives of the metric, kahler form, and holomorphic 3-form all
have to vanish:

lva(g) = lva(k) = lva() = 0 ,

6

implying that

va + va = 0
a + kv 
kv 
a = 0
v 
a + v 

a + v 

a = 0 .

in the following, rst we discuss the lagrangian of the gauge sector. next, as the gauge
group acts nontrivially on m and since 2 acting on the gauge multiplet produces a gauge
transformation, we will see how the transformation rules in (3) need to be modied.

the topological lagrangian describing the dynamics of gauge sector can be obtained more
conveniently by dimensional reduction of donaldson-witten theory in four dimensions. 1 to
do so, we start with the twisted lagrangian of n = 2 sym theory on a four manifold [3]

take the underlying four manifold to be y  r, for y the embedded 3-manifold. let
t parametrize the line r and simply require that the elds not depend on t. setting

1 alternatively, one may follow [12] to construct the lagrangian of the gauge multiplet.

(18)

(19)

as y has no boundary, the second term in the action vanishes by the bianchi identity. so
the xed point equations reduce to

fij = 0 , di = di = 0 .

notice that g  2 acting on the elds in (19) produces an innitesimal gauge trans-
formation. so to couple the gauge multiplet to the sigma model we need to change the
transformation rules in (3) such that 2 is not zero but a gauge transformation. firstly,
a , for a the gauge
note that the innitesimal action of g on the coordinates is gx   av 
parameter. so to have 2 = g, we need to change the transformations (3) to

this, in particular, gives the proper gauge transformation of  as a section of x(t ):

x  = i  ,

 =  av 
a .

g  a v 

a  .

with this change, the covariant derivative of x , dix  = ix  +aa
a , transforms (just like
) as a vector under g. as we are interested in having a set of gauge invariant equations,
and since the metric, k and  are all invariant under the g action, we replace s and kij with

i v 

(det (gdix djx ))

1
2 ijkdix djx dkx 

1
3!

s = 1 +
kij = dix djx k .

let us now see if any changes need to be made in the transformation rules of  and ij.
since the action is brst-exact and we want to maintain its invariance under ,  has to be
a gauge invariant quantity

0 = s = 2 = g .

on the other hand, as s and k are gauge invariant, a look back to (5) shows that the conjugate
elds  and ij also have to be gauge invariant. this implies that the transformation rules
(4) do not need any changes. the gauge invariant version of the sigma model action can
now be derived by varying the  with respect to the newly dened , lsig = i{q, }. this
turns out to be the action in (7), if we do the following substituations:

ix   dix 
i  i + aa

i  v 

a  .

(20)

the total lagrangian is then the sum of the lagrangians lsig and (18)

l = lg + lsig .

the u (1) case

in the case of u(1) gauge group with a trivial action on m, the xed point equations
constrain the map x  to be a special lagrangian submanifold, and the u(1) gauge connection

8

living on the embedded 3-manifold to be at. in the previous section, we saw that msl is
parametrized by a torus t b1.
it is also easy to see that the moduli space of at u(1)
connections on y is parametrized by a torus t b1. so the dimension of the total moduli space

to match [11].

m is 2b1. suppose m has a mirror fm . quantum mirror symmetry then implies that the
total moduli space m is nothing but the mirror manifold fm, and b1 = 3 for the dimensions

we conclude that for the u(1) gauge group, the path integral calculation of the cor-
responding topological sigma model reduces to an integral over the mirror manifold. the
lagrangian of such a topological sigma model coupled to gauge elds should in principle be
obtainable starting from the lagrangian of super yang-mills theory on a calabi-yau 3-fold
[13] and then reducing it on to a 3d submanifold. we hope to return to this point in future.

appendix

in this appendix, using the conventions of [13], we derive equation (6).

let m be a calabi-yau 3-fold. as such, there exists a spinor  on m which is a singlet
under the holonomy group su(3). take  to be left-handed and normalize it such that
 = 1. let us choose a representation for the gamma matrices such that they are hermitian
and antisymmetric;  =  ,  =  ,  =  ( where  = 1
2{, }). thus
(21)
(22)

7 =  , 7 = 
7 =  , t7 = t ,

 and  are left-handed while  and t are right-handed spinors. this in particular implies
that

also, it is easy to see that  = 0. we dene

 =  = 0 .

k = i
 =  .

(23)
(24)

as  is a singlet under the holonomy group, these are nowhere vanishing closed forms.
therefore we recognize k and  as the kahler and holomorphic 3-form on m, respectively.
