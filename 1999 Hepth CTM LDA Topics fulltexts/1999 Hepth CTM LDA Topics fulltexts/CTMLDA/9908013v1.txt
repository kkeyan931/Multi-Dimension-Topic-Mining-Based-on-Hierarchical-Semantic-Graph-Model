abstract

in m-theory on s1/z2, we point out that to be consistant, we should keep
the scale, gauge couplings and soft terms at next order, and obtain the soft

term relations m1/2 = a, |m0/m1/2|  1/3 in the standard embedding
and m1/2 = a in the non-standard embedding with ve branes and k5,n =
0. we construct a toy compactication model which includes higher order
terms in 4-dimensional lagrangian in standard embedding, and discuss its scale,
gauge couplings, soft terms, and explicitly show that the higher order terms do
aect the scale, gauge couplings and especially the soft terms if the next order
correction was not small. we also construct a toy compactication model in
non-standard embedding with ve branes, calculate its kahler potential, gauge
kinetic function, and discuss the scale, gauge couplings and soft terms. we
argue that, in general, we might not push the physical calabi-yau manifolds
volume to zero at any point along the eleventh dimension.

1 introduction

m-theory on s1/z2 suggested by horava and witten [1] is a 11-dimensional supergrav-
ity theory with two boundaries where the two e8 yang-mills elds live on respectively.
a lot of study on compactication ( standard embedding and non-standard embedding
) and phenomenology have been done [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41].
and as we know, the key which connects the m-theory on s1/z2 to the low energy
phenomenology is the susy breaking soft terms, because if we knew the soft terms,
by running rge, we can obtain the low energy susy particle spectra and discuss
their search in the future collider. on the other hand, if we knew the low energy
susy particle spectra from future collider, we might derive the soft terms by solving
rge [42]. therefore, we need to understand the susy breaking soft terms as well
as possible.

the orginal eleven-dimensional lagrangian obtained by horava and witten [1]
is at order of 3/2. and wittens solution to the compactication of m-theory on
s1/z2 which have n=1 supersymmetry in 4-dimension just considered the next or-
der expansion of the metric [2]. moreover, after compactifying the theory on the
deformed calabi-yau manifold, a. lukas, b. a. ovrut and d. waldram obtained
the 4-dimensional lagrangian which is at order of 4/3 [19]. the explicit expansion
parameter which is dened in the following section, is x. however, the soft terms:
m1/2, m 2
0 , a which were obtained previously in standard embedding for the simplest
compactication [22], include the higher order correction, i.e., when we expand the
soft term m1/2, m 2
0 , a as polynomial in x for |x| < 1, we have the terms which are
proportional to xn where n > 1. this is inconsistent to the original calculation, be-
cause we did not include higher order correction to the previous lagrangian, or the
kahler potential, gauge kinetic function and superpotential. in short, the correct soft
terms should be at order of x, and this is a good approximation only when x is small.
in this paper, we calculate the soft terms m1/2, m 2
0 , a at order of x in standard em-
bedding, and compare with previous calculation. we nd out that x < 0.2, we have
good approximation, we will have observable deviation if x is large, i. e., x > 0.5.
therefore,the phenomenology discussions, like low energy susy particle spectra and
collider serach, should keep in the small x region. in addition, we also discuss the
scale and gauge couplings at order x, and the detail discussions are similar to those in
[14, 15, 39] with small x. furthermore, we obtain the follwoing soft term relations in
standard embedding or non-standard embedding without ve brane for the simplest
compactication:

m1/2 = a , |

m1/2|

(1)

because the orginal eleven-dimensional lagrangian is at order of 3/2. and
wittens solution is at next order, it is very dicult to do the calculation which
includes higher order correction unless one makes some simplication. in order to

1

discuss higher order correction and compare the dierences of the soft terms, we use
the following ansatz in our toy model: (1) we just consider the lagrangian which was
obtained by horava and witten [1], (2) we do not consider the higher order expansion
of the deformed metric, (3) we do not consider the higher order correction to the
bulk elds. because the massive modes contributions are supressed by the factor
1/6
v
p
p
unication [14, 39], we just consider the massless modes.

which is at about 0.1 order and very small when we consider the intermediate

in standard embedding, under this ansatz and considering the calabi-yau
manifold with hodge-betti number h(1,1) = 1, h(2,1) = 0, we calculate the higher order
correction to the lagrangian, or the scale, gauge couplings, kahler potential, gauge
kinetic function and superpotential. under xn = 0 limit for n > 1, our results are
the same as those obtained previously [16, 19]. in this toy model compactication,
we nd out that:

(i) in order to keep g11,11 positive, we can not push the physical calabi-yau

manifolds volume in the hidden sector to zero [2].

(ii) x = 1 is not the m-theory limit. x = 3 or y = 1 ( where y is one-third
of x ) is the limit which pushes the physical calabi-yau manifolds volume in the
hidden sector to zero, but, in order to keep g11,11 positive, we require that x < 3/2 or
y < 1/2. and x = 3/2 or y = 1/2 is considered as m-thoery limit in this paper. in
other words, we dene the m-theory limit as the limit which keeps the signature of
the metric invariant, i. e., the total high order corrections to the metric are less than
the zeroth order metric in each component of the metric.

(iii) we have strong contraints on the gauge coupling h and gut scale mh

in the hidden sector:

1
27

gu t < h < 27gu t ,

mgu t < mh < 3mgu t .

(iv) we notice that, if y is small ( y < 0.2 ), in large parameter space, the
magnitude of the gaugino mass is larger than that of the scalar mass, and if y is large
( y > 0.3 ), in the most of the parameter space, the magnitude of the gaugino mass is
smaller than that of the scalar mass. however, in the previous soft term analysis [22],
the magnitude of the gaugino mass is often larger than that of the scalar mass in the
standard embedding. in addition, we compare the soft term deviations with the two
scenarios discussed in the second paragrah.

non-standard embedding in m-theory on s1/z2 is also an interesting sub-
ject [27, 30, 31]. we can embed the spin connection to the two e8 gauge elds, so,
after compactication, the gauge groups in the observable sector and hidden sector
will be go and gh, which are subgroups of e8. and we can include the ve branes,
states which are essentially non-perturbative in heterotic string. the presence of the
ve branes is very important to the three generation gut model building because

2

they introduce more freedom in the anomaly cancellation condition that consistent
vacvua need to satisfy [31, 37]. and introducing ve branes will aect the gauge
kinetic function, kahler potential and non-perturbative superpotential by gaugino
condensation in the next order because one introduces more moduli whose real parts
are the positions of the ve-branes. without ve brane, the non-standard embeddings
results are similar to those in the standard embedding. with ve brane correction,
we discuss the scale, gauge couplings and soft terms to the next order, and we nd
that if there are no kahler potential for the ve brane moduli ( k5 ), we obtain the
soft term relation:

m1/2 = a .

(4)

this may be interesting in the low energy phenomenology analysis. furthermore,
we consider the toy model compactication and calculate its kahler potential, gauge
kinetic function, superpotential, and discuss its scale, gauge couplings and soft terms.
our results are:

(i) in order to keep g11,11 positive, we can not push the physical calabi-yau

manifolds volume in the hidden sector to zero [2].

(ii) m-theory limit is: y5b = 1

2 or y5b = 1, where y5b is dened in the following
section. in order to keep g11,11 positive, we require that y5b < 1
2 , and in order to keep
the signature of metric g invariant, we require that y5b > 1. in short, we obtain:
1 < y5b < 1
2.
(iii) we have strong contraints on the gauge coupling h and gut scale mh
in the hidden sector:

1
64

gu t < h < 64gu t ,

1
2

mgu t < mh < 2mgu t .

(5)

(6)

of course, we have more freedom in phenomenology discussion if we include
ve branes, for we introduce the new parameters i where i=1, n. therefore, we do
not do the numerical analysis of the soft terms because we just have three soft term
parameters: m1/2, m 2
0 , and a, and we can make them as free parameters by varying
i and  which is dened in the following section.

finally, we argue that, in general, we might not push the physical calabi-yau

manifolds volume to zero at any point along the eleventh dimension.

our conventions are the following. we denote the eleven-dimensional coor-
dinates by x0, . . . , x9, x11 and the corresponding indices by i, j, k, . . . = 0, . . . , 9, 11.
the orbifold s1/z2 is chosen in the x11direction, so we assume that x11  [, ]
with the endpoints identied as x11  x11 + 2. the z2 symmetry acts as x11 
x11. then, there exist two ten-dimensional hyperplanes, m 10
i with i = 1, 2, lo-
cally specied by the conditions x11 = 0 and x11 = , which are xed under the

3

action of the z2 symmetry. when we compactify the theory on a calabi-yau three-
fold, we will use indices a, b, c, . . . = 4, . . . , 9 for the calabi-yau coordinates, and
indices ,  . . . = 0, . . . , 3 for the coordinates of the remaining, uncompactied, four-
dimensional space. holomorphic and antiholomorphic coordinates on the calabi-yau
space will be labeled by a, b, c, . . . and a, b, c, . . .. in addition, we denote the hyper-
plane m 10

1 as the observable sector, and the hyperplane m 10

2 as the hidden sector.

first, let us review the gauge couplings, gravitational coupling and the physical
eleventh dimension radius in the m-theory [15]. the relevant 11-dimensional la-

where p, vp are the physical eleventh dimension radius and calabi-yau manifolds

obtains:

(12)

the gut scale mgu t and the hidden sector gut scale mh when the calabi-yau
manifold is compactied are:

m 6

gut = vp(1 + x) ,

m 6

h = vp(1  x) ,

or we can express the mh as:

mh = (

h
gu t

)1/6mgu t = (

)1/6mgu t .

noticing that m11 = 2/9, we have

m11 = h2(4)2/3 guti1/6

mgu t .

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

and the physical scale of the eleventh dimension in the eleven-dimensional metric is:

[p]1 =

(17)

where mpl = 2.4  1018 gev. from the constraints that mgu t and mh are smaller
than the scale of m11, one obtains:

(18)

(19)

for the standard embedding, the upper bound on x is 0.97 ( x < 0.97 ), for gu t = 1
25 .
second, let us review the kahler potential, gauge kinetic function, superpo-
tential and soft terms in the simplest compactication of m-theory on s1/z2. the
kahler potential, gauge kinetic function and superpotential are [16, 19]:

k = k + k|c|2 ,

k =  ln [s + s]  3 ln [t + t ] ,

where s, t and c are dilaton, moduli and matter elds respectively.  is the next
order correction constant which is related to the calabi-yau manifold and it is:

 =

x(s + s)
t + t

.

(26)

the non-perturbative superpotential due to the gaugino condensation is [21, 43]:

wnp = h exp(

82

c2(gh)

(s  t )) ,

(27)

where the group in the hidden sector is gh and c2(gh) is the quadratic casimir of
gh. and in this case, gh is e8 and c2(gh) = 30.

with the standard fomulae [44, 45], one can easily obtain the following soft

terms [13, 22]:

m1/2 =

3c0m3/2

1 + x

(sin eis +

a = 

where m3/2 is the gravitino mass,

f s = 3m3/2c0(s + s) sin eis ,

f t = m3/2c0(t + t ) cos eit ,

and v0 for the tree level vacuum density.

generically, the dynamics of the hidden sector may give rise to both < f s >
and < f t >, but one type of f term often dominates. therefore, we concentrate on
the two limiting cases: dilaton dominant susy breaking (f t = 0) and the moduli
dominant susy breaking (f s = 0) [44, 45] 2:

(i) dilaton dominant susy breaking scenario (f t = 0). in this case, the soft

terms become

m1/2 =

3m3/2
1 + x

,

m 2

0 = m 2

(34)

(35)

(36)

(ii) moduli dominant susy breaking scenario ( f s = 0 ). in this case, the

soft terms become

m1/2 =

x

1 + x

m3/2 ,

m0 =

x

3 + x

m3/2 ,

a = 

3x

3 + x

m3/2 .

therefore, we have

m0/a = 1/3 ; 3  m1/2/m0  2 .

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

however, the previous calculation is expanded in x ( small x is considered)
and the lagrangian, kahler potential and gauge kinetic function are at order of x.
therefore, to be consistent, we should keep the scale, gauge couplings and soft terms

2 in the discussion of the dilaton dominant susy breaking scenario and moduli dominant susy
breaking scenario, in order to obtain the simple soft term relations, we set v0 = 0 , c0 = 1 and
s = t = 0.

at order of x, because there may exist other high order correction ( x2 and higher
) to the lagrangian, or kahler potential and gauge kinetic function. considering
xn = 0 for n > 1, the following previous scale and gauge coupling equations need to
be changed:

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

and the next order soft terms are:

a = 

obviously, we have m1/2 = a. and we obtain the soft terms in the two limiting
case:

(i) dilaton dominant susy breaking scenario (f t = 0):

m1/2 = 3m3/2(1  x) ,

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

m 2

0 = (1  x)m3/2 ,
3m3/2(1  x) .
dilaton dominant susy breaking: m1/2 = a = 3m0.

a = 

(ii) moduli dominant susy breaking scenario ( f s = 0 ):

soft term relations are the same as those obtained in the weakly coupled string with

8

m1/2 = xm3/2 ,

m0 = 0 ,

a = xm3/2 .

(51)

(52)

(53)

soft term relations: m1/2 = a, m0 = 0 are similar to the no-scale case [46]: m1/2 6= 0
and m0 = a = 0, for a is not very important in the rge running.
because in general, we have m1/2 = a. we might need to know the relations
between the magnitude of m1/2 and that of m0. taking v0 = 0, c0 = 1, we can
express |m1/2|2 as following:
|m1/2|2 = 3m 2
we obtain that

2/3x2(cid:16)3 sin2  + cos2   23 cos(s  t ) sin  cos (cid:17) .

m1/2| versus  by taking x =0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 which are
represented by the solid, dots, dotdash, and dashes lines, respectively. we can see
that the deviation from 13
is large when  closes to 0 or , or x is large. the
soft terms are dierent from those obtained in the weakly coupled string where one
has [44]:

2.2 toy model compactication and its phenomenology

if we did not consider the higher order correction to the bulk elds, one can easily
write down the most general parametrized kahler potential, gauge kinetic function
and non-perturbative superpotential. for the simplest compactication, they are [14]:

k = k + k|c|2 ,

k =  ln [s + s]  3 ln [t + t ] ,

using standard method [44, 45], one can easily calculate the soft terms. but, here,
one introduce many parameters, which is useless to the low energy phenomenology
analysis. therefore, we construct a toy simple model as an example which contains
high order correction.

in fact, in order to consider high order correction to the scale, gauge couplings
and soft terms in detail, we need to consider the higher order lagrangian. however,
the original lagrangian is at order of 3/2 [1], and the wittens solution to the com-
pactication of m-theory on s1/z2 which have n=1 supersymmetry in 4-dimension
just considered the next order expansion of the metric [2]. therefore, it is really very
tough to consider the higher order terms realistically. the ansatz of our toy model is
that, we just consider the lagrangian which was obtained by horava and witten, we
do not consider the higher order expansion of the metric and higher order correction
to the bulk elds. under this ansatz, we can discuss the higher order correction to the
scale, gauge couplings, kahler potential, gauge kinetic function and superpotential.
the bosonic part of the eleven-dimensional supergravity lagrangian is given

in this paper, we consider the compactication on the calabi-yau manifold
with hodge-betti numbers h(1,1) = 1 and h(2,1) = 0. for the zeroth-order metric, there
are only one dilaton and one modulus controlling the overall size of the calabi-yau
space and the length of the orbifold interval. we write

ds2 = g(0)

 dxdx + e2ag(0)

abdxadxb + e2c(dx11)2 ,

(64)

10

so that the physical calabi-yau volume vp is e6av and the physical length of the
orbifold interval p is ec. for the next order correction, because the massive
modes are supressed by the factor v
which is at about 0.1 order and very small
when we consider the intermediate unication, we just consider the massless mode.

(75)

because s3 is proportional to (0) in the original lagrangian and its order is 4/3, we
use s2 to obtain the kahler potential, gauge kinetic function and the superpotential
in this toy compactication:

one can easily prove that, when  is very small, i. e., taking 2 =0, one obtains the
same results as those obtained previously [16, 19].

now, we will consider the phenomenology in the toy compactication. first,

let us discuss the scale and gauge couplings,

.

by the way, comparing the compactication in last subsection, we have: y = x

3 ,  = 
3 .

13

the gut scale mgu t and the hidden sector gut scale mh when the calabi-

yau manifold is compactied are:

m 6

gut = vp(1 + y)3 ,

m 6

h = vp(1  y)3 ,

or we can express the mh as:

mh = (

1 + y
1  y

)1/2mgu t ,

m11 = h2(4)2/3 guti1/6

and the physical scale of the eleventh dimension is:

mgu t .

(93)

.

[p]1 =

in order to keep g11,11 positive, we require that  1

2 . in addition, in
g. 2, we plot the  versus y, and we nd that  is about 1. so,  will not change
previous scale picture [14, 15, 39]. and the bounds on mh and h are:

2 < y < 1

gu t < h < 27gu t ,

(94)

(95)

in addition, because  1
2, the discussions of the scale and gauge couplings
are similar to those in [14, 15, 39] with small x. so, we will not redo the discussion
here again.

second, let us discuss the soft terms from above kahler potential and gauge
kinetic function. using standard tree level fomulae [44, 45], we obtain the following
soft terms:

m1/2 =

3c0m3/2

1 + y

hsin (1  2y)eis + 3x cos eiti ,

14

(96)

(97)

where

a =

1  y2 m3/2c0(1  3y + 8y2) sin eis
1  y2 m3/2c0(1  3y) cos eit ,

f t = m3/2c0(t + t ) cos eit ,

and v0 for the tree level vacuum density.

(98)

(99)

(100)

(101)

1/2 < m t

1/2 < m o

now, we discuss the numerical results for the soft terms by taking v0 = 0, c0 =
1, and s = t = 0. first, we compare the soft terms. we denote the original soft
terms ( eq.s (28-30) ) as scenario o, the soft terms ( eq.s (44-46) ) at next to the
leading order which is simple as scenario s, the soft terms ( eq.s (95-97)) in above toy
compactication as scenario t. choosing  = 
4 , we draw the soft terms: m1/2, m0, a
versus x in g. 3, g. 4, and g. 5 respectively. we notice that, when x < 0.2, three
scenarios agree very well, when x > 0.5, we can see the obvious dierences among
them. in addition, we can compare the magnitudes of the soft terms in these three
scenarios: m s
0 , |a|s < |a|o < |a|t . therefore,
if we discuss m-theory phenomenology from the soft terms, we should keep in the
small x region in order to be consistent, because we do not know the higher order
correction, although in realistic model, x might be large. second, we analyze the
soft terms in the toy compactication, we drow the soft terms versus  by choosing
y = 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 in g. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 respectively. we notice that, if y is small
( y < 0.2 ), in large parameter space, the magnitude of the gaugino mass is larger
than that of the scalar mass, if y is large ( y > 0.3 ), in the most of the parameter
space, the magnitude of the gaugino mass is smaller than that of the scalar mass.
however, in previous soft term analysis in standard embedding, the magnitude of the
gaugino mass is often larger than that of the scalar mass [22]. we also discuss the
case that y < 0, where we just use y = 0.3 as an example in g. 11.

the non-standard embedding without 5-branes is similar to the standard embedding
in section 2.1. in general, non-standard embedding includes 5-brane correction, which

15

introduces additional moduli elds zn, whose real parts are the 5-brane positions
along the eleventh dimension. the kahler potential, gauge kinetic function and
superpotential are [31]:

and k5 is the kahler potential for the moduli elds zn. in addition, 0, n +1 are the
instanton number in the observable sector and hidden sector, n where n=1, ..., n is
the magnetic charge on each 5-brane. the cohomology constrants on i is:

i = 0 ,

n +1xn=0

(111)

which means the net charge should be zero.

with assumption: < zn >=< rezn >, < s >=< s >, < t >=< t >, we

discuss the scale and gauge couplings rst [39]:

(119)

where n= 1, ..., n. y5b is a function of above x, and in general, 5b will not be 1
in non-standard embedding with ve branes. however, 5b may close to 1 for we
consider the small next order correction, so, it will not change the previous scale
picture [14, 15, 39].

the gut scale mgu t and the hidden sector gut scale mh when the calabi-

yau manifold is compactied are:

m 6

gut = vp(1 + e) ,

(120)

17

or we can express the mh as:

m11 = h2(4)2/3 guti1/6

and k5,n = k5/zn, k5,n m = 2k5/(znz m), n = /zn, n m = 2/(znz m).
the original calculation is at order of . therefore, to be consistent, we should
keep the scale, gauge couplings, and soft terms at order of , because there may
exist other high order correction ( 2 and higher ) to the lagrangian, or the kahler
potential and gauge kinetic function. considering n = 0 for n > 1, the following
scale and gauge coupling equations need to be changed:

gut =

obviously, if k5,n=0, we obtain m1/2 = a in this case, too. for the scale and
gauge couplings, because we consider small  or the small next order correction, the
discussions are similar to those in [14, 15, 39] with small x. and because too many
parameters in the soft term expressions, we will not do the numerical analysis here,
for we can just let m1/2, m0, a as free parameters.

3.2 toy compactication and its phenomenology

in this section, we will consider the toy compactication in non-standard embedding.
first, we consider the case without ve-brane, which is similar to the case in subsetion

19

2.2. therefore, we just write down the kahler potential, gauge kinetic function and
superpotential:

k = k + k o|co|2 + k h|ch|2 ,

the soft terms in the observable sector are similar to those in the subsection 2.2.
the only dierence between here and subsection 2.2 is that in section 2.2, the gauge
group in the hidden sector is e8, but here the gauge group in the hidden sector is the
subgroup of e8.

now, we consider the case with ve-brane. the next order metric is the

following [31]:

ds2 = (1 + y5b)g(0)

 dxdx + (1  y5b)e2ag(0)

abdxadxb

+(1  2y5b)e2c(dx11)2 .

(147)

20

m-theory limit is: y5b = 1
2 or y5b = 1. in order to keep g11,11 positive, we require
that y5b < 1
2 , and in order to keep the signature of metric g invariant, we require
that y5b > 1.
2. the physical calabi-yau
manifolds volume is obvious non-zero at any point along the eleventh dimension,
and if one dened v min
as the minimum and maximum physical calabi-
yau manifolds volume along the eleventh dimension respectively, one obtains that:

in short, we obtain: 1 < y5b < 1

and v max

p

using same ansatz in section 2.2, we obtain the kahler potential, gauge kinetic

funtion and the superpotential:

(168)

(169)

in addition, the discussions of the scale and gauge couplings are similar to those
in [14, 15, 39] with small x if we dened the physical eleventh dimension length as
pt
5b. so, we will not redo the discussions here again. furthermore, the t
5b might
be at about 1 because of the constraints on i and the charge distributions.

because we introduce the new parameters i where i=1, n if we included ve
branes, we have a lot of freedom in phenomenology discussions. we do not do the
numerical analysis of the soft terms because we just have three soft term parameters
m1/2, m 2

0 , and a, and we can make them as free parameters by varying i and .

4 the physical calabi-yau manifolds volume

in above toy compactications, we notice that the physical calabi-yau manifolds
volume at any point along the eleventh dimension can not be zero from the metric
directly. and we can argue that this may be the general result. the next order metric
can be written as [2, 19]:

bab = bab ,

in addition, the magnitude of

bab. because the massive modes are suppressed, bab can be written
ab and 2bab have the
ab is larger than that of 2bab,
same sign.
for example, in the toy compactication, the magnitude of 2bab is half of that of
2

ab which can be easily proved at next order in general. therefore, in order to
keep g11,11 positive, we may not push the physical calabi-yau manifolds volume to
zero at any point along the eleventh dimension.

5 conclusion

in m-theory on s1/z2, we point out that to be consistant, we should keep the scale,
gauge couplings and soft terms at next order in the standard embedding and non-
standard embedding, and obtain the soft term relations m1/2 = a, |m0/m1/2| 
1/3 in the standard embedding and soft term relation m1/2 = a in non-standard
embedding with ve branes and k5,n = 0. furthermore, we construct a toy com-
pactication model which includes higher order terms in 4-dimensional lagrangian
in standard embedding, and discuss its scale, gauge couplings, soft terms, and ex-
plicitly show that the higher order terms do aect the scale, gauge couplings and
especially the soft terms if the next order correction was not small. we also construct
a toy compactication model in non-standard embedding with ve branes, calculate
its kahler potential, gauge kinetic function, and discuss the scale, gauge couplings
and soft terms. and m-theory limit gives strong constraints on the gauge coupling
( h ) and gut scale ( mh ) in the hidden sector in these toy models. finally, we
argue that, in general, we might not push the physical calabi-yau manifolds volume
to zero at any point along the eleventh dimension.

the phenomenology consequences from the soft terms obtained in this paper

and the multi moduli toy compactication are under investigation.
