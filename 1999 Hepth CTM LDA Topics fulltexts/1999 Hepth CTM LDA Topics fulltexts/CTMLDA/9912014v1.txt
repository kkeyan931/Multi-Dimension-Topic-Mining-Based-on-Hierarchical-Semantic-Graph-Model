abstract

we provide a gauge covariant formalism of the canonically quantized theory of spin-
3/2 rarita-schwinger gauge eld. the theory admits a quantum gauge transformation by
which we can shift the gauge xing parameter. the quantum gauge transformation does
not change the brst charge. thus, the physical hilbert space is trivially independent of
the gauge xing parameter.

1 introduction

in the standard formalism of canonically quantized gauge theories[1, 2] we do not consider
the gauge transformation freely. there are no quantum gauge freedom since the quantum
theory is dened only after the gauge xing.

yokoyamas gaugeon formalism[3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7] provides a wider framework in which we
can consider the quantum gauge transformation among a family of lorentz covariant linear
gauges. in this formalism a set of extra elds, so called gaugeon elds, is introduced as the
quantum gauge freedom. this theory was proposed for the quantum electrodynamics[3, 4,
5] and for the yang-mills theory.[6, 7] owing to the quantum gauge freedom it becomes
almost trivial to check the gauge parameter independence of the physical s-matrix.[8]

we should ensure that the gaugeon modes do not contribute to the physical processes.
in fact, the gaugeon elds yield negative normed states.[3] to remove these unphysical
modes yokoyama imposed a gupta-bleuler type subsidiary condition,[3, 6, 7] which is
not applicable if interaction exists for gaugeon elds. yokoyamas condition has been
improved by introducing brst symmetry for gaugeon elds.[9, 10, 11, 12] unphysical
gaugeon modes, as well as unphysical modes of the gauge eld, are removed by the
single kugo-ojima type condition.[2] thus, the formalism is now applicable even in the
background gravitational eld. the brst symmetry is also very helpful in the analysis
of the gauge structure of the fock space in the gaugeon formalism.[11, 13]

by now, we have the brst symmetric gaugeon formalism of the electromagnetic gauge
theory[10, 11] and of the yang-mills gauge theory.[9, 12] there are, however, other types

1

of gauge elds, such as the gravitational eld, the gravitino (spin-3/2 gauge eld), the
anti-symmetric tensor gauge elds and the string theory. one might wonder whether the
gaugeon formalism is applicable to these gauge elds. in the present paper, we formulate
a brst symmetric gaugeon formalism for the spin-3/2 rarita-schwinger gauge eld.
although we treat it mainly in the free eld case, we can straightforwardly incorporate
the interaction with the ricci at background gravitational eld.

the paper is organized as the following. in 2, we briey review the theory of hata
and kugo[14] as a standard formalism of the canonically quantized spin-3/2 gauge eld.
in 3, we propose a brst symmetric gaugeon formalism for the spin-2/3 gauge eld,
where gauge xing parameter can be shifted by a q-number gauge transformation. we see
in 4 how the fock space of the standard formalism is embedded in the wider fock space
of the present formalism. section 5 is devoted to comments and discussion, including the
remarks on other types of gaugeon formalism.

2 standard formalism

the classical lagrangian of the free gravitino eld  in n ( 3) dimensional at space-
time is given by

lrs = 

i
2

,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where  is the matrix  anitisymmetrized with respect to ,  and ,

 =

1
6

(  5 terms).

the factor 1/2 arises in (2.1) since we assumed the eld  to be a majorana spinor-
vector. the lagrangian (2.1) is invariant up to total derivatives under the gauge trans-
formation

 = ,

(2.3)

where  is an arbitrary spinor eld.

to carry out the quantization, it is necessary to add a gauge xing term and a corre-
sponding faddeev-popov (fp) ghost term. as a standard formalism, we use the theory
of hata and kugo.[14] their quantum lagrangian is given by

lhk = lrs + b/() 

ia
2

b/b  icc,

(2.4)

where  = , / = , b is a spinor multiplier (subject to the fermi statistics),
c and c are the spinor fp ghosts (subject to the bose statistics), and a is a numerical
gauge xing parameter. note that the fp ghost elds satisfy the second order dierential
for example, {, } = 2g with g =
if one needs to consider the non-majorana case, the factor 1/2 should be omitted. in the following

diag(1,1,1, . . . ,1).
in this paper, we assume that all the spinor elds are majorana.

we use the convention of bjorken-drell.

hereafter, we refer to this parameter a as the standard gauge parameter.

2

equation. owing to this property, fp ghosts c and c together with the multiplier b realize
the correct ghost counting.[15, 16]

the eld equations are given by

from which we also have

i = /b,
/() = ia/b,
2c = 2c = 0,

2b = 0,
2() = 0.

(2.5)

(2.6)

the lagrangian (2.4) leads to the following n-dimensional (anti)commutation rela-

tions:

( + )(cid:21) d(x  y)

{(x), (y)} = (cid:20)g/ +
n  2
n  2  a(cid:19) /e(x  y),
+(cid:18) 4

/ 

2

1

n  2

{b(x), (y)} = id(x  y),
{b(x), b(y)} = 0,
[ c(x), c(y) ] = d(x  y),

where the functions d and e are dened by

2d(x) = 0,
2e(x) = d(x),

d(0, x) = 0,

e(0, x) = e(0, x) = 0.

d(0, x) = (n1)(x),

(2.7)

(2.8)

from the rst equation of (2.7) we have

{(x), (y)} = a/d(x  y),

(2.9)
there are two special gauges. one is the landau gauge (a = 0), in which {, } = 0 so
that the  mode has vanishing norm. the other is the feynman gauge (a = 4/(n  2)),
in which  does not include dipole modes: the feynman propagator ht ( )i does not
have 1/p4 term.
the lagrangian (2.4) is invariant up to total derivative terms under the following

brst transformation:

b = ic,
bc = b,
bb = bc = 0.

(2.10)

in the feynman gauge, it is convenient to use a eld variable  =   1

a = 4/(n  2), it satises the dirac equation / = 0, and the anticommutation relation becomes

2 ().[17] when

{(x),  (y)} = g/d(x  y).

the corresponding conserved brst charge is given by

qb(hk) = iz b



 0 c dn1

x,

(2.11)





 0. using this charge we can dene the physical subspace v (hk)
where
space of the states which satisfy the physical subsidiary condition of kugo-ojima,[2]

 0= 0

phys as a

qb(hk) |physi = 0.

(2.12)

there are many unphysical zero-normed states in the physical subspace v (hk)
v (hk)
phys has a zero-normed subspace

phys . in fact,

im qb(hk) = n|i; |i = qb(hk)|io .

considering the quotient space of v (hk)
hilbert space,

phys by this subspace, we can dene the physical

which has positive denite metric.

h(hk)
phys = v (hk)

phys /im qb(hk),

(2.13)

(3.1)

3 gaugeon formalism

we start from the lagrangian

l = lrs + b/() 

( y +  b)/(y + b)   yy

i
2

icc  i kk,

where, in addition to the usual multiplier b and fp ghosts c and c, we have introduced
spinor gaugeon elds y and y (subject to the fermi statistics) and corresponding spinor
fp ghosts k and k (subject to the bose statistics). in (3.1),  denotes a sign factor
( = 1) and  is a numerical gauge xing parameter. as seen below, the standard gauge
xing parameter, which is denoted by a in the present paper, can be identied with

a = 2.

(3.2)

3.1 field equations and (anti)commutation relations

field equations which follow from (3.1) are

i = /b,
/() = i/(y + b),
2y = i/(y + b),
2y = 0
2c = 2c = 0,
2k = 2k = 0.

4

(3.3)

from these equations we also have

2b = 0,
2() = 0,
/ 2y = 0.

(3.4)

the canonical prescription of quantization leads to the following n-dimensional (anti)commutation

relations: among the usual elds (, b, c, c), we have

1

n  2

( + )(cid:21) d(x  y)

{(x), (y)} = (cid:20)g/ +
n  2
n  2  2(cid:19) /e(x  y),
+(cid:18) 4

/ 

2

{b(x), (y)} = id(x  y),
{b(x), b(y)} = 0,
[ c(x), c(y) ] = d(x  y).

among the gaugeons and their fp ghosts (y , y, k, k), we have

{y(x), y(y)} = 0,
{y(x), y (y)} = id(x  y),
{y (x), y (y)} = /e(x  y),
[ k(x), k(y) ] = d(x  y).

anticommutators between the gaugeons and the usual elds are given by

{y(x), b(y)} = {y(x), (y)} = 0,
{y (x), b(y)} = 0,
{y (x), (y)} = /e(x  y).

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

the (anti)commutation relations (3.5) are exactly the same with (2.7) if we assume (3.2).

in particular,  = 0 corresponds to the landau gauge, and  = 2/n  2 (together with

 = +1) leads to the feynman gauge. we notice from (3.7) that in the landau gauge
( = 0) the gaugeon modes y and y completely decouple from the usual elds  and
b.

3.2 brst symmetry

the lagrangian (3.1) is invariant up to total derivatives under the following brst trans-
formation:

b = ic,
bc = b,
bb = bc = 0,
by = ik,
bk = y,
by = bk = 0,

5

(3.8)

which obviously satises the nilpotency, b
charge is given by

2 = 0. the corresponding conserved brst

qb = iz (cid:18) b



 0 c + y



 0 k(cid:19) dn1

x.

(3.9)

by the help of this charge we can dene the physical subspace vphys as a space of the
states satisfying
(3.10)

qb |physi = 0.

this subsidiary condition removes the gaugeon modes as well as the unphysical gravitino
modes from the physical subspace; y and y together with k and k constitute the
brst quartet.[2]

3.3 q-number gauge transformation

the lagrangian (3.1) admits a q-number gauge transformation. under the eld redeni-
tion

 =  +  y,
y = y   b,
b = b,
c = c +  k,
k = k   c,
c = c,

y = y,

k = k,

(3.11)

with  being a numerical parameter, the lagrangian (3.1) is form invariant (up to total
derivative terms), that is, it satises

l(a, ) = l( a, ) + total derivatives,
where a stands for any of the relevant elds and  is dened by

 =  + .

(3.12)

(3.13)

an immediate conclusion from the form invariance (3.12) is the following: all the
eld equations and all the (anti)commutation relations are gauge covariant under the q-
number gauge transformation (3.11): a satises the eld equations (3.3), (3.4) and the
(anti)commutation relations (3.5)  (3.7) with  replaced by .
it should be noted that the q-number gauge transformation (3.11) commutes with the
brst transformation (3.8). as a result, our brst charge (3.9) is invariant under the
q-number gauge transformation:

(3.14)
the physical subspace vphys is, therefore, invariant under the q-number gauge transfor-
mation:
(3.15)

bqb = qb.

similarly, our physical hilbert space hphys = vphys/im qb is also gauge invariant:

bvphys = vphys.
chphys = hphys.

6

(3.16)

4 gauge structure of the fock space

as well as the brst symmetry (3.8), the lagrangian (3.1) has several other symmetries.
in particular, we have the following brst-like conserved charges:

0 b dn1

x,





qb(hk) = iz c
qb(y) = iz k
b(hk) = iz k
b(y) = iz c

q

q



0 y dn1

x,



0 b dn1

x,

0 y dn1

x,

(4.1)

all of which satisfy the nilpotency condition. our brst charge qb can be decomposed
as

qb = qb(hk) + qb(y).

(4.2)

the charge qb(hk) generates the brst transformation only for the usual elds , b,
c and c, while qb(y) applies only for y , y, k and k. the charge q
b(hk) generates
the brst transformation for  and b but with k and k treated as their fp ghosts.
similarly, q
b(y) generates the brst transformation for y and y with c and c as their
fp ghosts.

in the last section, we have taken (3.10) as a physical condition. instead of it, however,

we may choose the condition as

qb(hk) |physi = 0,
qb(y) |physi = 0.

(4.3)

the unphysical modes of gravitino are removed by the rst equation, while the gaugeon
modes by the second. we express the space of states satisfying (4.3) by v ()
phys. as easily
seen, this space is a subspace of vphys dened in the last section:

v ()
phys  vphys.
we have attached the index () to v ()
phys to emphasize that its denition depends on the
gauge xing parameter . in fact, the brst charges qb(hk) and qb(y) transform as

(4.4)

bqb(hk) = qb(hk) +  q
bqb(y) = qb(y)   q
while their sum qb (and thus vphys) remains invariant.

let us dene a subspace v () of the total fock space v by

b(hk),

b(hk),

v () = ker qb(y) = {|i  v; qb(y) |i = 0}  v,

which includes v ()

phys as a subspace since by denition v ()

phys can be expressed as

v ()
phys = {|i  v (); qb(hk) |i = 0}  v ().

7

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

the space v () corresponds to the total fock space of the standard formalism in a = 2
phys corresponds to the physical subspace v (hk)
gauge. and thus, as seen from (4.7), v ()
phys of
the standard formalism in a = 2 gauge. this can be understood from the facts that

1. the modes of gaugeons and their fp ghosts are removed from the space v () by the

condition qb(y) |physi = 0.

2. the usual elds , b, c and c satisfy the (anti)commutation relations exactly the

same with those of the standard formalism in a = 2 gauge.

one may understand the rst fact by expressing the lagrangian (3.1) as

l = lhk(a = 2)  i(cid:26)qb(y),  ky + i k/(cid:18)1

2

y + b(cid:19)(cid:27)

+total derivatives,

(4.8)

where lhk(a = 2) denotes the lagrangian of the a = 2 standard formalism.
we emphasize that the above arguments are also valid if we start from the q-number
gauge transformed charges (4.5) rather than qb(hk) and qb(y). for example, we can
dene the subspaces v (+ ) and v (+ )

phys by

v (+ ) = ker bqb(y),
v (+ )
phys = ker bqb(hk)  ker bqb(y).

(4.9)

v (+ ) can be identied with the fock space of the standard formalism in a = ( +  )2
gauge, and v (+ )
corresponds to its physical subspace. thus various fock spaces of the
standard formalism in dierent gauges are embedded in the single fock space v of our
theory.

5 comments and discussion

5.1 type ii theory
we have seen in 3 that the gauge xing parameter  can be shifted freely by the q-
number gauge transformation. however, we cannot change the sign of the standard gauge
parameter a = 2. the situation is analogous to the type i gaugeon formalism for qed.
there are two types of the gaugeon theory for qed.[4] one of them is the type i theory
where the standard gauge parameter is expressed as a = 2, and the other is the type
ii theory where the a = . in both types of the theory,  can be shifted as  =  + 
by the q-number gauge transformation. thus, in the type ii theory, we can shift the
standard gauge parameter quite freely. we comment here that the type ii theory can be
also formulated for the spin-3/2 gauge eld.

strictly speaking, we have two theories corresponding to the value of  = 1. consequently, we have
two fock spaces, to which we refer as v+ and v corresponding to the value of . thus the statement
becomes as follows: all of the fock spaces of the standard formalism for all values of a  0 [a  0] are
embedded in the single fock space v+ [v] of our theory.

8

let us consider the following lagrangian,

lii = lrs + b/() 

icc  i kk.

i
2

b/b 

i
2

y/b   yy

(5.1)

under the q-number gauge transformation (3.11), this lagrangian is also form invariant
(up to total derivatives):

lii(a, ) = lii( a, ) + total derivatives,

(5.2)

with  dened by (3.13). as easily seen, the lagrangian (5.1) is also invariant (up to total
derivatives) under all of the transformations corresponding to the brst charges (4.1).
using the charge qb(y) we can express the lagrangian as

lii = lhk(a = )  i(cid:26)qb(y) ,  ky +

i
2

k/b(cid:27) + total derivatives,

which leads to the identication

a = ,

(5.3)

(5.4)

nothing but the characteristic of a type ii theory. it should be noted that all the argu-
ments given in 4 also apply to this type ii theory.

5.2 extended type i theory

if we put  = 0 in the type i lagrangian (3.1), the gaugeon sector decouples from the
rest. then the remaining sector has the same form with the lagrangian of the standard
formalism in the landau gauge. thus, the equivalence of the theory to the standard
formalism is manifest in the landau gauge. this situation does not occur in the type ii
theory. the gaugeon sector in (5.1) does not decouple for any value of . in this sense,
the type i theory is preferable to the type ii theory. as seen above, however, we cannot
change the sign of the standard gauge parameter a in the type i theory, while in the
type ii theory we can shift it quite freely .

for the qed case, an extended type i theory is known,[13] where we can shift the
standard gauge parameter quite freely. in this theory, two sets of gaugeons and their fp
ghosts are introduced. in the following, we provide an extended type i gaugeon formalism
for the spin-3/2 gauge eld.

we start from the lagrangian,

i = lrs + b/()  i( y1 + 1 b)/(y2 + 2b)   y1y1
l

 y2y2  icc  i k1k1  i k2k2,

(5.5)

where we have introduced two sets of gaugeon elds (yi, yi) and their fp ghosts (ki,
ki), and two gauge xing parameters i (i = 1, 2). if we put 1 = 2 = 0, then the
gaugeon sector decouples form the rest and the remaining sector is equal to the landau
gauge lagrangian of the standard formalism. in this sense, this is an extension of the
type i theory.

9

the lagrangian (5.5) is invariant up to total derivatives under the following brst

transformation:

b = ic,
bc = b,
bb = bc = 0,
byi = iki,
bki = yi,
byi = bki = 0,

(i = 1, 2)

(5.6)

which satises the nilpotency, b
nilpotent brst-like charges:

2 = 0. the corresponding brst charge is a sum of three

qb = qb(hk) + qb(y1) + qb(y2),

where qb(hk) is dened by (2.11) and qb(yi)s are given by

qb(yi) = iz ki



0 yi dn1

x.

(i = 1, 2)

as usual, the physical subspace is dened by this brst charge: vphys = ker qb.

we dene the q-number gauge transformation by

 =  + 1y1 + 2y2,
yi = yi  ib,
yi = yi,
b = b,
c = c + 1k1 + 2k2,
ki = ki  ic,
c = c,

ki = ki,

(i = 1, 2)

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

where i is the parameter of the transformation (i = 1, 2). under this transformation,
the lagrangian is form invariant (up to total derivatives):

l
i(a, 1, 2) = l

i( a, 1, 2) + total derivatives,

where a stands for any of the relevant elds and is are dened by

i = i + i.

(i = 1, 2)

(5.10)

(5.11)

the brst charge qb (5.7) is invariant under the q-number transformation (5.9). as a
result, the physical subspace vphys is gauge invariant.
lagrangian (5.5) as

to see the relation of the theory to the standard formalism, we may express the

i = lhk(a = 12)  i{qb(y) ,  k1y1 +  k2y2
l

+i k1/y2 + i2 k1/b + i1 k2/b} + total derivatives,

(5.12)

10

where qb(y) is a nilpotent brst charge dened by qb(y) = qb(y1) + qb(y2). this lead
us to

a = 212,

(5.13)

which can be shifted into an arbitrary value by the q-number gauge transformation (5.9).
we can show that both of the fock spaces of type i and type ii theory are embedded
into the total fock space of this theory. the arguments are quite parallel to the case of
qed.[13] for example, by the q-number gauge transformation we can always shift the
parameters 2 into 2 = 1/2. with this value of the parameter, the lagrangian (5.5) can
be expressed as

i = lrs + b/() 
l

i1
2

b/b 

i
2

y1/b   y1y1

icc  i k1k1
i{qb(y2) ,  k2y2 + i( y1 + 1 b)/k2},

(5.14)

which is the same expression of the type ii lagrangian (5.1) up to qb(y2)-exact operators.
consequently, the subspace vii = ker qb(y2) can be identied with the fock space of the
type ii theory.

5.3 gauge invariance
we have seen in 4 that the subspace v () = ker qb(y)  v can be identied with the
total fock space v (hk) of the standard formalism in a = 2 gauge. this does not
mean, however, that these spaces are isomorphic to each other. instead, we can show the
following isomorphism:

v ()/ im qb(y) = v (hk).

(5.15)

namely, by considering the quotient space we can ignore the the qb(y)-exact states (states
having the form qb(y)|i), which have no corresponding states in v (hk). eq.(5.15) is the
precise statement that our theory includes the standard formalism as a sub-theory. as
for the hilbert spaces, it can be shown that

phys = h(hk)
h()
phys ,
phys is a physical hilbert space dened by

where h()

(5.16)

h()
phys = v ()
with n () being a zero-normed subspace of v ()
our gauge invariant hilbert space hphys is isomorphic to h()
the gauge invariant result:

phys/n (),
phys. furthermore, we can also verify that
phys. therefore, we are lead to

(5.17)

phys = h()
h(hk)

phys = hphys.

(5.18)

the detailed arguments of (5.15) and (5.16) will be reported elsewhere. similar discussion
holds for the theories of type ii and extended type i.

5.4 background gravitational eld

we have considered so far the theory in the at space-time.
incorporate the interaction with the background gravity, if it satises ricci atness.
in the background gravitational eld g, the classical lagrangian (2.1) becomes

it is straightforward to

lrs = 

i
2

g d,

(5.19)

where g = | det g|, d is the covariant derivative, and the greek indices of  are
now of the world coordinate thus having vielbein dependence. the lagrangian (5.19) is
invariant up to total derivatives under the gauge transformation

(5.20)

(5.21)

(5.22)

if the background gravitational eld satisfy the vacuum einstein equation:

 = d,

the quantum lagrangian (3.1) is now given by

r = 0.

l = lrs + g bd/ () 
d/ d/ c  ig k

igc

i
2



g( y +  b)d/ (y + b)  g y


d/ d/ k.


d/ d/ y

this lagrangian is invariant up to total derivatives under the brst transformation (3.8)
with an exception for , which transforms now as

b = idc.

the corresponding brst charge is given by

qb = z g j 0

b dn1

x,

where j 

b is the brst current dened by


b = b
j 

d c + y


d k.

(5.23)

(5.24)

(5.25)

(note that this current is actually conserved since the elds  = b, y, c and k satisfy
the klein-gordon equation

2 = dd = 0.

this is due to the ricci atness:

d/ 2 = (cid:18)dd +

r(cid:19)  = dd,

1
4

where r is the scalar curvature r = gr (= 0).) thus we can consistently dene the
physical subspace by vphys = ker qb.
gauge transformation (3.11)with an exception for , which transforms now as

the form invariance (3.12) also holds for the lagrangian (5.22) under the q-number

(5.26)
all the arguments in 3 hold also in the present case. especially, the brst trans-
formation commutes with the q-number gauge transformation, which leads to the gauge
invariance of the physical subspace (and the physical hilbert space).
