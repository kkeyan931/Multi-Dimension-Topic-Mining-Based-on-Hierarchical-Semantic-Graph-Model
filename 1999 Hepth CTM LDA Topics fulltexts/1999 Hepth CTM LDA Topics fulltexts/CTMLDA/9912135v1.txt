abstract

we extend our recent discussion of four-dimensional black holes bound to a two-brane

to include a negative cosmological constant on the brane. we nd that for large masses, the

solutions are precisely btz black holes on the brane, and btz black strings in the bulk.

for smaller masses, there are localized black holes which look like btz with corrections

that fall o exponentially. we compute when the maximum entropy conguration changes

from the black string to the black hole. we also present exact solutions describing rotating

black holes on two-branes which are either asymptotically at or asymptotically ads3.

the mass and angular momentum on the brane agree with that in the bulk.

december, 1999

1. introduction

in a recent paper [1] we constructed exact solutions describing four dimensional black

holes bound to a two-brane in anti-de sitter (ads) space. this construction was motivated

by the suggestion [2] that lower dimensional gravity is naturally induced on a brane (domain

wall) placed in ads spacetime [3]. the original discussion involved linearized perturbations

of a three-brane in ads5, but there were questions raised [4] about the boundary conditions

used near the ads horizon. by considering a two-brane in ads4, we were able to investigate

the viability of this scenario by studying the properties of exact black hole solutions.

we found that lower dimensional gravity was indeed reproduced on the brane at large

distances, with no diculty arising at the ads horizon. (the horizon geometry was, in fact,

unchanged.) large black holes appeared as attened pancakes with a much smaller extent

o the brane than along the brane. these features will extend to the ve dimensional

case. however, there were some awkward features of our solutions. the eects of four-

dimensional gravity were signicant even at scales much larger than the bulk cosmological

constant. this is perhaps not surprising given that 2 + 1 gravity (without a cosmological

constant on the brane) does not have any black hole solutions. another unusual feature of

2+1 gravity is that there is a maximum total mass. we found that as the mass approached

this limit, the size of the black hole grew without bound. thus one can have arbitrarily

large black holes with nite total mass.

in this paper we extend our previous analysis to allow a negative cosmological constant

in the 2 + 1 gravity theory induced on the brane. this has the advantage that both of

the unusual features of pure 2 + 1 gravity mentioned above are avoided. when a negative

cosmological constant is added, 2 + 1 gravity does have black hole solutions [5], and there

is no upper limit on the total mass. thus one might hope that this is a more realistic

model of the higher dimensional physics.

the solutions in [1] were obtained by starting with a metric describing an accelerating

black hole in ads4. we then introduced the two-brane by cutting the spacetime along

an appropriate surface and gluing it to a copy of itself. to add a cosmological constant

on the brane we start with a slightly more general solution, but in this case we have to

compactify the fourth direction by introducing two dierent branes. we will argue that

this is a general feature of branes with negative curvature and is not special to ads4.

unlike previous discussions of compactications with two branes [6], both of our branes

have positive tension.

1

we nd that large black holes on the brane agree exactly with the 2 + 1 dimensional

btz solution. however, these black holes are not localized near the brane. they extend

across the fourth dimension and form a btz black string. it is perhaps not surprising that

when the size of the extra dimension is nite, large black holes on the brane correspond

to black strings in the bulk. this is what one expects from a standard kaluza-klein

compactication. for smaller masses, we have two dierent black hole solutions in which

the horizon does not reach the second brane. in both cases, the solution looks like the

btz black hole with correction terms that fall o exponentially in the proper distance.

these terms are negligible outside the horizon for the solution with smaller area. o the

brane, it looks like the btz black string with its ends capped o. in other words, in this

case, the horizon looks more like a cigar than a pancake. the solution with larger horizon

area can have signicant deviation from the btz solution outside the black hole.

another motivation for considering a negative cosmological constant on the brane is

the following. it has been argued in higher dimensions that black strings are unstable when

their width shrinks to less than the ads scale [7]. since we now have exact solutions for

both the black strings and localized black holes, we can examine this transition in detail.

we nd that indeed the maximum entropy conguration changes from the black string to

the black hole when the minimum cross-sectional area is of order the ads radius.

for black holes on asymptotically at two-branes, it was shown [1] that the mass

measured asymptotically on the brane agreed with a four dimensional thermodynamic

mass obtained by integrating the relation dm = t ds in the bulk. we show that the same

is true for black holes on asymptotically ads3 branes.

we also construct solutions describing rotating black holes on a two-brane both with

and without a cosmological constant on the brane. in the rst case, we recover on the

brane the metric of rotating btz black holes with some modications. in the latter case,

the metric on the brane is locally equivalent to the metric on the equatorial plane of the

four-dimensional kerr solution. we will see that the rotation of the black hole in the four-

dimensional space is transferred to the brane in such a way that the angular momentum

detected on the brane is precisely equal to the four-dimensional angular momentum.

2. the ads c-metric and two-branes

we begin with the following solution to einsteins equation with negative cosmological

2

constant describing accelerating black holes in ads4 [8]:

ds2 =

1

a2(x  y)2 (cid:20)h(y)dt2 

dy2
h(y)

+

dx2
g(x)

+ g(x)d2(cid:21) ,

where

h(y) =  + ky2  2may3
g(x) = 1 + kx2  2max3

and k = +1, 0, 1. the metric satises rab = (3/2

4)gab, where

4 =

1

a + 1

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

sets the scale for the bulk cosmological constant i.e., 4 = 3/2
4. note that from eq. (2.4),
in the limit   1 (with k = 1), we recover the c-metric [9]
we require   1.
describing a pair of black holes accelerating in an asymptotically at spacetime. the
general solution with  > 1 is called the ads c-metric. this describes black holes
accelerating in ads4. the parameters m and a are related to the mass and acceleration

of the black hole (at least for certain limits  see below).

another interesting limit reduces the metric (2.1) to that of static four-dimensional

black holes in ads4 [10]. this limit turns o the acceleration parameter a as follows: set
y = 1/(ra), t = at,  = 4/3a2 > 0, and take the limit a  0 while keeping t, r, x,
 and 4 nite. in this way m gives the mass parameter of the static black hole solutions

of einsteins equations with a negative cosmological constant 4. recall that the horizons
of the static k = 1 black holes are topological spheres and have nite area. in contrast,
the k = 0, +1 black holes have horizons with the topology of r2 and innite area,

the special case of (2.1) with  = 0 and k = 1 was employed in [1]. many of the
descriptive comments made there still apply for the general metric (2.1). for example,
due to the overall factor (x  y)2, the solution does not include points with x = y.
generically, these points correspond to the boundary of the asymptotically ads geometry.

hence, we will restrict y to always be less than x. there is also a curvature singularity at
y = . clearly both t and  are killing coordinates. as the notation indicates  is an
angular coordinate and each zero of g(x) corresponds to an axis for the rotation symmetry.

similarly t may be regarded as the time coordinate, and each zero of h(y) corresponds to

a killing horizon for t. the smallest zero y0 of h(y) denes the black hole event horizon.
typically one nds that the accelerating black holes have horizons with the topology of r2

3

and innite area, for all k values.1 only for k = 1 and ma not too large, is the event
horizon a sphere with nite area.

to orient ourselves with the metric (2.1), let us set m = 0. the geometry then has

constant curvature and is locally the same as ads4. to cast the metric into a more familiar

form dene

then (2.1) becomes

r = py2 + x2
a(x  y)

 =s 1 + kx2
y2 + x2 .

ds2 =

(2.5)

(2.6)

these forms of the ads4 metric had been considered earlier in [11]. the metric in the
brackets has constant riemann curvature r
). when m = 0,
 can be rescaled by rescaling the coordinates r and , and so one may set  = 0 or
1. these three choices correspond to three distinct ways of slicing ads4. notice that
 = 0, k = 1 corresponds to the usual poincare invariant slices.

 =  (

to introduce a brane into the spacetime, we need a surface whose extrinsic curvature



  



is proportional to the intrinsic metric. then we can cut the spacetime o at the surface,

take two copies of one side, and glue them together. the resulting space will have a delta-

function stress tensor along the surface which is proportional to the induced metric, i.e.,

a two-brane. the extrinsic curvature of a surface can be computed via

k =  n =

1
2

ng

(2.7)

where ,  run over the components tangent to the surface, and n is the unit outward
pointing normal vector. (the last formula results in the special case that n = 0, which
will apply in the cases of interest for this paper.) for example, a short calculation reveals
4   g. hence the space
can be cut at any of these surfaces and glued to a copy of itself to construct domain walls

that slices at constant r in eq. (2.6) satisfy k = r1pr2/2

(two-branes).

since a surface r = l has constant curvature, there is a cosmological constant 3 =
/l2 on the brane. hence there are three distinct cases: (i)  = 0, in which case the
1 note that this innite area is not a problem for the present analysis. as in [1], the innite
tail of the horizon will be cut out by the introduction of a two-brane and we will obtain a black

hole of nite size.

4

radial slices are at. here we may only choose k = 1. the choice k = 1 yields global
minkowski coordinates with t timelike everywhere. (ii)  < 0, in which case the radial
slices have the geometry of three-dimensional de sitter space, ds3. with k = 1, t is
timelike for small  and there are de sitter horizons on the two-brane at  = ||1/2. the
latter correspond to y2 =  in the c-metric coordinates of eq. (2.1). (iii)  > 0, where
locally the constant r slices have the geometry of ads3. the three possible values of k yield
dierent parameterizations of ads3: k = 1 corresponds to global coordinates, whereas
k = 0 and k = +1 yield the metrics for massless and massive btz black holes [5] (after

 is periodically identied  see next section). this case with  > 0 will be the primary

focus of our investigations below.

in their constructions, randall and sundrum introduced branes on poincare invariant
slices of ads, e.g., r = constant in eq. (2.6) with  = 0, k = 1. there were two
distinct scenarios. originally they considered compactifying the transverse dimension by

the introduction of two branes on either end of a nite interval in ads [6]. in this case, one

nds that the inner brane must have a negative tension. however, in a second scenario,

they also found lower dimensional gravity arose for a single brane and an innite transverse

dimension [2]. these discussions were extended to de sitter slicings to give a description

of inationary cosmology within the context of the randall-sundrum constructions [12].

in this case, one may again consider two distinct scenarios. either one has two branes

bounding a nite interval, one with positive tension and the other with negative tension,

or one has a single brane. in the latter case, however, the transverse direction is not innite

since the brane is spherical and encompasses a nite region at the center of ads. following

the discussion above, these constructions would correspond to placing the branes along

surfaces of constant r with  < 0 in eq. (2.6).

finally one may consider the randall-sundrum construction for branes with negative

curvature. a subtlety arises in this case which we will illustrate explicitly in four dimen-

sions, but the same comments also apply for ve or higher dimensions. in eq. (2.6) with
 > 0, grr is singular at r = 4 but this is simply a coordinate singularity [11]. the
latter is most easily seen by making the coordinate transformation r = 4 cosh u, with
which eq. (2.6) becomes

ds2 = 2

4du2 + 2

(2.8)

here we see the entire spacetime is covered by  < u < . however there are now two
asymptotic regions where the scale factor for the negative curvature slices grows without

4 cosh2 u(cid:20)(2  k)dt2 +

+ 2d2(cid:21) .

d2

2  k

5

bound, i.e., u  . consider introducing a single brane by cutting along a surface
of constant u, removing the region with large positive u and gluing an identical copy of

the remaining geometry. the resulting space would still have two asymptotic regions as
u   on either side of the single brane. in this situation, the zero mode bound to
this brane would not be normalizable. alternatively, one might say that it would require

an innite amount of energy to excite this mode [1]. in any event, one would not nd an

eective lower dimensional theory of gravity on the brane. hence for the negative curvature

slicings, one must introduce two branes by making two cuts and removing both asymptotic
regions at u  . gluing this geometry to an identical copy of itself produces a space
where the gravitational zero mode would be normalizable and one would nd gravity is

eectively lower dimensional on large distance scales.

another interesting feature arises here because with the negative curvature slicing,

the ads space eectively contains a throat. that is, the scale factor multiplying the
4 cosh2 u, decreases monotonically to a minimum value
metric on each slice, i.e., r2 = 2
at r = 4 (or u = 0) as we approach this surface from either of the asymptotic regions.
hence if we cut the metric (2.8) along one surface at constant positive u and the other at
constant negative u, and remove both asymptotic regions at large |u|, then the extrinsic
curvature on both ends will be a positive multiple of the metric. hence both of the branes
in this construction will have a positive tension, in contrast to the cases with   0, or
with  > 0 when both cuts are made in the positive u region.2

for a randall-sundrum construction with two negative curvature branes, we now

compute the relationship between the four-dimensional newtons constant and that for

the eective three-dimensional theory of gravity on the branes. the metrics under consid-

eration are of the form

ds2 =

dr2
4  

r2
2

+

r2
l2
1

g (x) dxdx .

(2.9)

we are assuming that one of the branes lies on the slice at r = l1 (on the positive u

patch), so g is precisely the induced metric on this brane. this metric will satisfy
r = (2/l2
1) g. we will assume that the second brane lies at r = l2 on the patch
with u < 0 (and so the induced metric there is (l2/l1)2g). now as in standard kaluza-
klein compactication, we have to integrate over the volume between the two branes.

2 the throat also allows for other exotic constructions. for example, one could produce a

single brane by cutting at u = u0 and identifying these two surfaces.

6

hence we integrate r from l1 to the minimum radius 4 and then back out to l2
(on the negative u patch). since our interest is in relating g3 to g4, we focus on the

einstein-hilbert term in the action. the brane tensions will be tuned in order to produce

the required cosmological constant on the brane. the reduced eective action is then

(2.10)

(2.11)

note that we have inserted the appropriate cosmological constant term in the three-
dimensional eective action, where the three-dimensional ads scale is 3 = l1/. we
emphasize that this calculation is normalized for physicists living on the brane at r = l1.

now we turn to applying the randall-sundrum construction to the general solution

(2.1) with m > 0. it is clear from the m = 0 discussion that we have to introduce two

dierent branes.
in fact, the asymptotic region far from the black hole corresponds to
x, y  0. it follows from (2.2) and (2.3) that in this limit, the eects of the black hole
become negligible and the spacetime approaches (2.6). as usual, one can introduce a two-

brane on surfaces where the extrinsic curvature is proportional to the metric. so we need

to nd two such surfaces in the ads c-metric (2.1). for a surface of constant x, this will
be true when g(x) = 0. the simplest choice (and the one used in [1]) is to take the surface
x = 0. similarly, one can use a surface of constant y provided that h(y) = 0. the simplest
choice is again y = 0. so to construct our solution we take the points (x, y) with x  0 and
y  0 in (2.1) and glue this region to an identical copy along the boundaries x = 0 and
y = 0.3 it is natural to foliate the quadrant x  0, y  0 with surfaces of constant slope
x/y. since r is a function only of x/y (2.5), these are surfaces of constant r.4 the surface
x = 0 corresponds to r = 1/a and y = 0 corresponds to r = /a. however, note that

3 other possible locations for the branes will be considered briey in the discussion section.
4 even though r was originally dened for m = 0, it is convenient to introduce it even for
m > 0. this is because the solution far from the black hole always approaches the ads4 metric

(2.6).

7

these surfaces are on opposite sides of the throat. this can be seen in eq. (2.5) where

as x/y decreases from zero to minus innity, r decreases from 1/a to its minimum value,
and then increases back to /a. so these surfaces both have positive extrinsic curvature
(this can also be checked directly) and both correspond to positive tension branes. notice
that the brane at x = 0 cuts through the black hole horizon, and contains (for m 6= 0) the
singularity at y = . in contrast, the brane at y = 0 is completely non-singular and
does not contain any black hole horizons. these choices for the two branes correspond to
l1 = 1/a and l2 = /a in the previous paragraph. using eq. (2.4), a bit of algebra
then reduces eq. (2.11) to:

g3 =

ag4

2

.

(2.12)

notice that this is independent of  and curiously, it agrees with the relation derived with

a single brane and  = 0, i.e., a = 1/4 [1]. further with the above choice of l1, the

eective three-dimensional ads scale is given by

2
3 =

1

a2

.

(2.13)

note that 3 > 4, where the four-dimensional ads scale is given in eq. (2.4). it will be

useful to keep in mind that the parameters a and  together determine the cosmological

constant on the brane and the bulk, while m is related to the (localized) black hole on the

brane, which we discuss below.

3. black holes on the brane.

the ads c-metric with  = 0 was discussed extensively in [1]. here we examine the

case  > 0.

3.1. btz black strings

as noted above, when m = 0 the metric reduces to eq. (2.6) and if k = +1, surfaces

of constant r have the geometry of btz black holes [5] when we simply make a periodic
identication of  with some period . the horizon is at  = 1/. the entire spacetime
describes a btz black string in ads4. when the branes are introduced as above, the
black string extends between r = l1 = 1/a on the positive u patch and r = l2 = /a
on the negative u patch. these black strings are analogous to those constructed in [7],

except that we are considering a construction with two branes.

8

including the contributions from the two ads geometries that have been glued to-

gether, the total area of the event horizon is

a =

2
a2

.

(3.1)

note that at r = l1, the horizon has a proper circumference of c1 = /a. the
circumference shrinks to cmin = /a + 1 at r = rmin = 4, and then expands
again to c2 = /a as the string extends to r = l2.

to determine the eective mass, we compare the induced metric at r = l1 with the

standard btz metric [5]5

ds2 = (cid:18) 2

3  8g3m3(cid:19) dt2 +(cid:18) 2

(3.2)

where  has periodicity 2, and 3 is the three-dimensional radius of curvature (2.13). to

produce this form, we must rescale the coordinates in eq. (2.6) as

t =

a short calculation then shows that the total three-dimensional mass is

m3 =

1

2 (cid:19)2
8g3 (cid:18) 

.

(3.3)

(3.4)

note that the metric (3.2) has a conical-like singularity at  = 0. this singularity then

appears on each constant r slice of the btz black string and so extends throughout the

four-dimensional spacetime.

3.2. btz-like black holes

we are, however, more interested in solutions with localized four-dimensional black

holes on the brane, so we turn to the case with m > 0. the case m = 0 and k = 1

considered above was special in that g(x) never vanished, so  could have any periodicity.

for m > 0, this periodicity is xed by demanding that the geometry is smooth on the axis

where g(x) vanishes. with m > 0, g(x) always has one (and only one) positive root, x2,

and a conical singularity on this axis is avoided by setting  to

 =

4

|g(x2)|

.

(3.5)

5 in the literature on btz black holes, it is common to set g3 = 1/8.

9

recall that in our construction of a black hole localized on a brane, the portion of the
space with x < 0 is cut out and so x is restricted to lie in the range 0  x  x2. now if
we let  = 1/y the geometry induced on the two-brane at x = 0 is
 (cid:19)1

 (cid:19) dt2 +(cid:18)2  k 

a2 "(cid:18)2  k 

d2 + 2d2# .

2ma

(3.6)

1

ds2 =

2ma

this is similar to the locally ads metrics, but with extra terms of the form 2ma/ coming

from the four-dimensional nature of the black hole. while these corrections have power law

decay in , they are actually decaying exponentially in the radial proper distance which is

asymptotically rproper = 3 ln . this should be expected since we have compactied the

transverse direction by introducing two branes. hence, we should nd a discrete spectrum

of massive kaluza-klein modes for the uctuations of the four-dimensional metric [6]. this

behavior can be contrasted to that for asymptotically at branes with an innite transverse

dimension. there one nds power law corrections to the metric [1], or to the newtonian

potential [2,13,14], arising from a continuum of massive kaluza-klein modes.

as    we recover the geometry of the surface r = 1/a in (2.6). by rescaling the
coordinates as in eq. (3.3), we can compare this asymptotic geometry to the standard btz

form (3.2) in order to determine the three-dimensional mass. the result of this calculation

is

m3 =

k

2 (cid:19)2
8g3 (cid:18) 

.

using (3.5) and (2.3), it is useful to re-express this mass as

m3 =

k

2g3

(3.7)

(3.8)

now the horizon of the four-dimensional black hole is at the negative root of h(y), y = y0.

it extends o the brane at x = 0 to the maximum value of x, x2. using (2.5), the latter

corresponds to the radial coordinate

r0 = py2

0 + x2
2
a(x2  y0)

.

(3.9)

the area of the horizon is nite and equal to

a =

dx

(x  y0)2 =

a2

x2

|y0|(x2 + |y0|)

.

(3.10)

finally note that the brane metric (3.6) contains a curvature singularity at  = 0. this

singularity, however, is conned to the brane, and is not present on test two-branes at
r 6= 1/a, i.e., in the induced metric on constant r slices for r 6= 1/a.

now recall that k can take the values 0 or 1. so we discuss each of these individual

cases in turn below:

(i) k = +1:

this is the most interesting case since with k = 1, eq. (3.6) is similar to the btz
metric, but with extra ma/ corrections. if 2ma  1/2, these extra terms are negligible
outside the horizon, and so the exterior geometry is essentially identical to that of a btz
black hole. however, for 2ma  1/2, there will be signicant deviations from the btz
metric outside the black hole.

surprisingly, we see from eq. (3.8) that m3 vanishes both when ma  0 (x2  )
and when ma   (x2  0). this implies that, in contrast to btz strings, there is a
maximum mass for the black holes that are localized to the brane. the maximum mass
occurs at ma = 2/27 (x2 = 3), where

m3,max =

1

24g3

.

(3.11)

this is a very small mass of the order the three-dimensional planck mass. the eect is

entirely due to four-dimensional dynamics.

it would appear that one cannot localize a

large mass black hole on the brane. the only solution for large mass would the btz black
string. even though m3 vanishes when ma  0, it is not proportional to m even in this
limit. for small ma, x2  1/(2ma), and so we have

g3m3 = 2(ma)2.

(3.12)

there are two limits in which we can easily examine the geometry of the black hole

horizon: small ma, 2ma  min{1, 1/2}, and large ma, 2ma  max{1, 1/2}.

for small ma, x2  1/2ma and y0  . in this limit, the area of the event horizon

(3.10) approaches that of the black string with the same mass (same ). this is less

surprising if one observes that as ma goes to zero, x2 goes to innity, and r0 approaches
the position of the second brane at r = /a. that is, the horizon nearly stretches across
the bulk ads space to the second brane. with a closer examination, one realizes that
outside the horizon, y0  y < 0, the function h(y) is essentially unchanged by a small
ma. furthermore, g(x) is unchanged until x becomes of order 1/ma, at which point it

11

rapidly goes to zero. so the geometry near these localized black holes is very similar to

that of the btz black string o the brane. in fact, a small localized black hole is really
a black string which is capped o at the ends!6 one way of understanding the fact that

small btz-like black holes cannot be localized near the brane very well is just that there
are no small black holes in ads4 which look like btz on a slice (see the case k = 1
below).

for large ma, x2  (2ma)1/3 and y0  (/2ma)1/3. above, it was noted that the
mass measured on the brane goes to zero in this limit. however, the black hole area tends

to a nite value

a =

8
3a2

1

1/3(1 + 1/3)

.

(3.13)

similarly, the circumference of the horizon on the brane, c  4/3a1/3. further in this
limit, r0  1/3/a1 + 1/3 and the proper distance that the black hole extends o the

brane is nite. note that all of these quantities depend only on , but not on m. the

interpretation of the result for r0 depends on the value of . first note that in general

rmin = 4 is achieved in eq. (2.5) at x = |y|/ with negative y. hence given the values

of x2 and y0 above, we see that for small , r0 actually sits on the positive u side of the

throat and so the event horizon has a pancake geometry. as  increases, the black hole

becomes fatter and touches the throat at  = 1. for large , the horizon extends through

the throat onto the negative u patch.

of course, the most surprising eect found in the large ma regime is that one can nd

black holes of nite size with vanishingly small mass on the brane. this is reminiscent of

the fact that for asymptotically at branes,  = 0, one can construct arbitrarily large black

holes with nite energy [1]. this seemed to be related to the fact that there is a maximum

total mass in 2 + 1 gravity without a cosmological constant. we now see that even though

there is no a priori maximum mass when the cosmological constant is negative, there is

still an upper limit on the mass of a localized black hole on the brane. this results in nite

black holes with arbitrarily small mass.

in the section 4.1, we will examine the stability of these btz-like black holes as

compared to the btz strings, on the basis of their relative entropies.
(ii) k = 1:

6 these black holes would then realize the cigar-shaped horizon geometries envisioned in

ref. [7].

12

with k = 1, the metric on the brane (3.6) is then identical to a slice through the
equator of the (spherically symmetric) schwarzschild ads metric. the situation is now

similar to the case of an asymptotically at brane [1]: when ma is small, the horizon is

approximately spherical, but when ma is large, the black hole is a attened pancake. hence

in these geometries, the black hole is very eectively conned to the vicinity of the brane.
however, one crucial dierence is that the black holes with k = 1 have negative mass on
the brane, as seen in eq. (3.7). note that the mass of these black holes varies monotonically
from m3 = 0 for x2 = 0 (ma  ) to m3 = 1/8g3 for x2 = 1 (ma  0). precisely
this range of masses arise in the negative mass solutions in ads3 constructed in [5]. this
sector interpolates between the global ground state of ads3 (with mass m3 = 1/8g3)
and the massless btz black hole. in pure 2+1 gravity these solutions have (naked) conical

singularities. in the present context, these singularities can be hidden behind the horizons

of four-dimensional black holes.

(iii) k = 0:

the k = 0 solutions are very similar to the case of large ma and k = +1 (or k =
1). this is not new: it is known that in ads space, the horizons of static spherical or
hyperbolic black holes become at in the limit of innite mass (this is sometimes called

the innite volume limit, particularly in the context of the ads/cft duality).

in

the present situation, this can be achieved by scaling the mass and the coordinates as
(x, y, t)  1/3(x, y, t), m  m, and letting   .

4. black hole thermodynamics

we would now like to consider the thermodynamic properties of these btz-like black

holes on ads3 branes. consider rst the hawking temperature. as usual we can dene

the hawking temperature as t = /2 where  is the surface gravity of the black hole.

there is a small diculty since  depends on the normalization of the timelike killing
vector   t. in asymptotically at spacetimes, one usually requires that  have unit
norm at innity, but it is not obvious what the proper normalization is in the present

case where the branes are asymptotically ads. to resolve this diculty, we can turn to

the thermodynamics of the btz black hole (3.2). the circumference of the horizon is

c = 2rh = 432g3m3. hence the entropy satises

s = 3r 2m3

g3 

ds
dm3

=

32g3m3

=

t

.

(4.1)

13

now one nds that this temperature matches precisely the surface gravity of the killing

vector  = t, or alternatively  = 1/t is the periodicity of the euclidean coordinate  = it.
hence this suggests that if we normalize the coordinates such that the asymptotic metric

on the ads3 brane is

ds2  

2

3

dt2 +

2
3
2 d2 + 2d 2

(4.2)

where  has periodicity 2, then the hawking temperature will be the surface gravity

associated with the killing vector t in this coordinate system. so having decided on the
appropriate normalization, a short calculation shows that

t =

|h(y0)|
|g(x2)|

=

a

|y0|
x2

3ma|y0| + 1

the black hole entropy is simply determined by the four-dimensional area (3.10)

s = a
4g4

=



2g4a2

x2

|y0|(x2 + |y0|)

.

4.1. equality of three and four dimensional masses

(4.3)

(4.4)

for the case of asymptotically at branes, it was shown [1] that the three-dimensional

mass measured asymptotically on the brane agreed precisely with a four-dimensional ther-

modynamic mass obtained by integrating the rst law

m = t s.

(4.5)

we now show that this is also true when there is a negative cosmological constant on the

brane. it is impractical to try to express t in terms of s in order to compute m . instead,

it proves more convenient to express both s and t in terms of a single auxiliary variable.

an appropriate choice is

for which one has various identities such as

z = |y0|/x2

x2 =

|y0| =

2ma =

2ma

1

z

 + z2

 + z2

  z3 ,
  z3 ,
(  z3)3/2
14

2ma
( + z2)z1 + z

(4.6)

(4.7)

.

note that z is a monotonic function of ma, and that

ma  0 ,
ma   ,

z  2ma
z  1/3 .

(4.8)

one also has that x2 and |y0| are monotonic functions of z in the range 0  z  1/3.

now in terms of z, the hawking temperature (4.3) becomes

t =

az
2

2 + 3z + z3
 + 3z2 + 2z3 .

let us also consider

t
 z

=

a


(  z3)( + 3z  3z2  z3)

( + 3z2 + 2z3)2

.

(4.9)

(4.10)

from the latter we see that t / z = 0 at z = 1/3. for  < 1, t / z also has another
zero in the physical range 0  z  1/3. hence for   1, t is a monotonic function
increasing from 0 at z = 0 to

t (z = 1/3) =

a
2

2/3 .

(4.11)

for  < 1, t rises from 0 at z = 0 to a maximum at some intermediate value of z, and then
decreases down to a local minimum at z = 1/3 given by the same formula as in eq. (4.11).

in terms of z, the entropy (4.4) becomes

here again we also consider

s =

2

g4a2

z

 + 3z2 + 2z3 .

s
 z

=

2

g4a2

  3z2  4z3
( + 3z2 + 2z3)2 .

(4.12)

(4.13)

the latter always has a zero in the range 0  z  1/3. hence the entropy increases from
zero at z = 0 to a maximum at some intermediate value of z, and then decreases down to

s =

2

1

3g4a2

1/3(1 + 1/3)

at z = 1/3, in agreement with (3.13).

using the rst law (4.5), we can now integrate

m4
 z

= t

s
 z

15

(4.14)

(4.15)

with the boundary condition that m4 = 0 at z = 0. a short calculation yields

m4 =

1

g4a

z2(1 + z)(  z3)
( + 3z2 + 2z3)2 .

(4.16)

we want to compare this now to (3.8). expressing the latter in terms of z, one nds

m3 =

1

2g3

z2(1 + z)(  z3)
( + 3z2 + 2z3)2

(4.17)

so that using (2.12) we get precise agreement m3 = m4, just as was found in [1] for at

branes.

the thermodynamical analysis for k = 1 can be carried through in close analogy
to the analysis for btz black holes above. as a matter of fact, if we express the mass,

entropy and temperature in terms of the variable z of (4.6) we obtain precisely the same
results (4.9), (4.12), (4.16), and (4.17), only this time we have z3 > . in fact, we can also
recover the results for k = 0 by setting z3 = . hence, letting z vary over 0  z < , these
formulas give us m , s and t for the full range of black holes with  > 0 and arbitrary k.

if we compute the thermodynamic mass m4 of the btz black strings discussed above,

we again nd m3 = m4. to see this, notice that for a black string, the four-dimensional

entropy computed from the horizon area (3.1) agrees with the three-dimensional entropy

computed from the circumference (4.1):

s = a
4g4

=



ar 2m3

g3

= c
4g3

.

(4.18)

where we have used (2.12) and the fact that the geometry on the brane is exactly (3.2)
with 3 = 1/a. the temperature on the brane must also agree with the temperature
in the bulk since it is constant over the horizon. since the temperature and entropy both

agree, the mass obtained by integrating the rst law must also agree.

4.2. stability analysis

in the range 0  m3  1/24g3, there are two localized black hole solutions as well as
the black string. which of these solutions gives the correct stable conguration for a given

mass? in [7] it was suggested that the gregory-laamme instability [15] should play an

important role in determining the stable solution. gregory and laamme observed, in the

context of kaluza-klein compactication, that when a black string becomes longer than

its transverse size, unstable modes arise which appear to lead to the black string breaking

16

up into localized black holes. in [7], this result was combined with the observation that

in ads space the only metric uctuations that can be supported have proper wavelengths

shorter than the ads scale . hence it was argued that when the transverse size of a black

string reaches , the gregory-laamme instability should set in and cause the black string

to break up forming a localized black hole. their arguments were made in the context

of discussing black strings and black holes in the randall-sundrum scenario [2] with an

innite transverse dimension, but presumably they extend to the other scenario [6] with

a nite transverse dimension. this is the context in which we would like to consider this

mechanism here. because of the negative curvature on the branes, the minimum transverse
size of the black string actually arises at the throat, i.e., r = 4, rather than at the
second brane. in any event, the fact that the black strings only shrink to a minimum size

(which is some xed fraction of the transverse size on the brane) provides a explanation

as to why black strings should appear as the only (stable) solution for large masses. this

result is in fact very similar to ordinary kaluza-klein compactication where black strings

prove to be the appropriate solution for large masses. essentially there, localized black

holes with large masses do not t inside the compact dimensions.

however, presumably the range 0  m3  1/24g3 is a regime7 where the black strings
may break up and become localized. rather than attempting a detailed uctuation analysis

[15], we will argue stability of a given solution on the grounds that it maximizes the entropy

for a given mass. for small m3, the black string entropy (4.18) is approximately equal to

that of black holes with small ma. in accord with the physical picture of the horizon of

these black holes found in section 3.2, one can show that the black hole entropy is slightly

smaller than that of the black string. from fig. 1 one sees that in fact the black string

entropy exceeds that for all of the black holes in the range 0  ma  2/27  recall

that the upper limit corresponds to the maximum mass (3.11). on the other hand, for

large ma, m3 approaches zero again while the entropy has the nite limit in eq. (4.14), in

contrast to the vanishing entropy of the black strings. hence for small m3, these localized

black holes will provide the stable conguration. this is presumably a situation where the

strings are unstable and pinch-o to form a black hole. in order to verify the picture put

forward in ref. [7], one should determine the minimum mass where the black string entropy

still dominates over that of the black holes. one could then verify that this crossover occurs

when the minimum transverse size of the black strings reaches the ads scale.

7 recall this regime corresponds to the k = +1 black holes.

fig. 1: entropy versus mass for btz black strings (dashed line), btz-like black holes
(solid line, m  0), and k = 1 localized black holes in ads3 (solid line, m < 0). the
black hole curve starts at s = m = 0 for ma = 0, and then grows to a maximum of the
mass and entropy for ma = 2/27. as ma   the solutions tend to m = 0, s nite

(eq.(4.14)).

at the crossover point, the black string and black hole masses, eqs. (3.4) and (3.7)

(with k = +1), are identied and hence  is the same for both solutions. also equating

the black hole and black string entropies, eqs. (4.12) and (4.18) (substituting eq. (4.17) in

the latter), yields a fourth order polynomial in terms of the auxiliary variable

z(  z2  z3) = 0 .

(4.19)

here, the root z = 0 simply indicates that the mass and entropy of the small black holes

matches that of the black strings. denoting the solution of the crossover point as zx, it
satises

z2
x + z3

x =  .

(4.20)

while it would be possible to analytically determine the solution of this equation, we did

not nd such an explicit solution very illuminating. the circumference of the black string
at the throat was calculated to be cmin = /a + 1 in section 3.1. hence using
eq. (2.4), we have

2zx
3 + z2

(4.21)

using eq. (4.20), this result is implicitly a function of only . let us consider the result
for small  for which z2

x   and hence eq. (4.21) yields

cmin
24 

1
2

for small .

(4.22)

so at the transition point, the minimum size of the black string horizon is indeed of order

the ads4 scale. this result is certainly consistent with the instability mechanism suggested
in ref. [7]. on the other hand, for large , one has z3

x   and hence

cmin
24 

2

31/6  1

for large .

(4.23)

hence we seem to have found an inconsistency with the discussion of ref. [7].

what has gone wrong? to resolve this apparent contradiction, we take a closer look

at the spacetime geometry. first recall

4 =

1

a + 1

,

l1 =

1
a

,


a

.

l2 =

now in the regime of small , we have

l1  4  l2 ,

(4.24)

(4.25)

and hence the rst brane at r = l1 plays the role of the planck brane, i.e., it inherits

the larger scale factor from the ads geometry. thus our construction and analysis are

consistent with the suggested instability mechanism [7]. that is, as the mass of the black

string shrinks (by, e.g., , hawking radiation) eventually its minimum cross-section reaches

the ads scale 4. at this point, the gregory-laamme instability causes the string to

break up and form a black hole localized in the vicinity of the planck brane at r = l1. on

the other hand, in the regime of large , we have

l2  l1  4 ,

(4.26)

and hence the second brane at r = l2 plays the role of the planck brane. hence using

the mechanism of [7], we would argue that as the mass of the black string shrinks, it
would become unstable when cmin/24  1 and the string would then break up to form
a black hole localized at the second brane, not the brane at r = l1. hence while the

result in eq. (4.23) is not incorrect, it is probably not relevant to determining the stable

19

conguration in this situation. that is we are comparing the black string to the wrong

black hole solution. instead we expect the true stable solution to be a black hole localized

on the brane at r = l2, but our construction in section 3 has not provided us with this

solution.

in short, in the regieme where we can reliably compute the transition between the

black string and black hole, our results are consistent with the estimates in [7].

5. adding rotation

it is easy to include the eects of rotation into the picture. what we need is a

metric that describes an accelerating, rotating black hole in a spacetime with a negative

cosmological constant. such a solution can be found as a member of a subfamily of solutions
of the most general type d metric8 constructed in [8] (the complete family of neutral

solutions possesses, in addition, a nut parameter, which we have set to zero here). the

solution we are interested in is

ds2 =

1

a2(x  y)2(cid:20) h(y)

(5.3)

h(y) =  + ky2  2may3  a2y4
g(x) = 1 + kx2  2max3 + a2x4
and k = +1, 0, 1. again, the metric satises rab = (3/2
(2.4). the ads c-metric (2.1) is recovered by simply setting a = 0.

4)gab, with 4 dened as in

when m = 0 the geometry is once again that of ads4 in disguise. in this case, the

r = py2 + x2

y2 + x2

.

(5.4)

8 a type d metric is one in which the weyl tensor is algebraically special and has two pairs
of repeated principal null directions [16]. the d stands for degenerate and has nothing to do

with d-branes or d-terms.

(5.5)

the three-dimensional metrics in brackets have constant riemann curvature. notice that,

as before, these sections at constant r are sections at constant x/y. now, however, the

coordinate systems are rotating. for  > 0 and k = +1, 0, these sections are precisely

the geometries of rotating btz black holes. so the entire spacetime can be viewed as a

rotating btz black string.

the metrics (5.1) present features familiar from the kerr metric. for example, when

m 6= 0 they have a curvature singularity at

1
y2 + a2x2 = 0,

(5.6)

which is closely analogous to the ring singularity of the kerr solution at r2 + a2 cos2  = 0

in standard boyer-lindquist coordinates. on the other hand, at the zeroes xi of g(x) the
killing vector


  ax2

i


t

(5.7)

has a xed-point set. these are the rotation axes. in order to avoid a conical defect at

one of them, say at x = x2, then we have to identify points along the integral curves of

(5.7) with the appropriate period. this corresponds to changing coordinates from t,  to
t,  where

t = t + ax2

2

and choosing the period of  to be given by (3.5), on surfaces of xed t.9

in a similar way, at the roots yi of h(y) the killing vector


t

+ ay2
i




(5.8)

(5.9)

becomes null. these correspond to horizons with angular velocity  = ay2

i . actually, this
is appropriate only if we are considering black strings with no rotation axis. as we have

9 of course, periodic identication of  at constant t is not the same as periodic identication

of  at constant t.

21

just seen, if there is an axis, regularity requires that we use t,  coordinates. in this case,

the angular velocity is

 =

ay2
i

1 + a2x2

2y2
i

(5.10)

observe that when a 6= 0, h(y) will typically have one more root than in the case a = 0.
this corresponds to the addition of an inner horizon which is characteristic of rotating

black holes.

the construction of a two-brane can be performed, as before, at x = 0 (and also

at y = 0, which will be needed when  > 0). to analyze the metric on the brane, let
 = 1/y, so the section at x = 0 is

(5.11)

when  > 0 and k = 1, this is similar to the rotating btz metric, only with additional

2ma/ terms due, as we discussed earlier, to the four-dimensional origin of the black hole.

the discussion following (3.6) applies to this situation as well. in the following we focus

on the cases of asymptotically at branes,  = 0, and asymptotically ads3 branes,  > 0.

5.1.  = 0: kerr black holes on the brane

black holes on asymptotically at branes were studied, in the absence of rotation, in

[1] the notation used there corresponds to  = ma and  = 1/a. here we will focus

only on the new features introduced by a non-vanishing a.

when  = 0 (a = 1/4) we have to set k = 1, in order that t is timelike at innity
on the brane. when m = 0, the roots of g(x) are just xi = 1, and |g(xi)| = 2 so to
avoid conical singularities on these axes we need to set t = t+a as in eq. (5.8) and identify

 with period 2 (3.5). the geometry is that of ads4, but instead of the coordinates (5.4)

it is more convenient to dene

z = 1 

x
y

,

 = p(1  x2)(1 + a2y2)

y

which brings the metric (5.1) into poincare coordinates

ds2 =

2
z2 (dt2 + d2 + 2d2 + dz2).
4

(5.12)

(5.13)

apart from z being essentially the inverse of r, the choice of radial coordinate on the brane

is slightly dierent from (5.4) with  = 0.

22

now consider the case m > 0. as was the case in the absence of rotation, when  = 0
the surface y = 0 is a degenerate cosmological horizon analogous to z =  in (5.13). when
|a| < ma there are two other zeroes of h(y), at y = y0 =  ma
, which are
interpreted as inner and outer black hole horizons. in the extremal limit |a| = ma, they
coincide at y = 1/ma. if |a| > ma the singularity would be naked.

m2a2a2

the metric on the brane at x = 0 is locally equivalent to the equatorial slice of the
four-dimensional kerr metric. to see this, set t = (t + a)/a,  = /a. then since  = 0
and k = 1, (5.11) becomes

a2 

a2

ds2 = (cid:18)1

(5.14)

this is indeed the equatorial section of the kerr solution, with mass g4m4 = m and

rotation parameter a/a.

even though the metric on the brane is locally equivalent to kerr it is not globally

equivalent. this is because the identication we need to remove the conical singularities

on the axis forces the solution to rotate at innity. this can be seen as follows. observe

that when  = 0 the function g(x) is the same as in the absence of rotation. this means

that the axis of  lies along the same value of x2 as the nonrotating ads c-metric, and

the periodicity (3.5) is determined only in terms of ma and not of a. however (5.8) shows
that we must hold t = t + ax2
t = t  ax2

2 into (5.11) (with  = 0 and k = 1), then to leading order the metric is

2 (rather than t + a) xed when we identify . if we set

ds2 =

1
a2 [dt2  2a(1  x2

2)dtd + d2 + 2d2]

(5.15)

we now want to compare this with the metric that describes a particle of spin j3 in 2 + 1

dimensions [17]

(with  periodically identied on xed t surfaces). clearly

ds2 = (dt + 4g3j3d)2 + d2 + 2d2

j3 =

a(1  x2
2)
4ag3

(5.16)

(5.17)

for small ma, x2  1  ma, and we have seen that the four-dimensional mass and
angular momentum of the kerr black hole are m = g4m4 and j4 = m4a/a. substituting

into (5.17) and using (2.12) to relate the newtons constants, we nd

j3 = j4

23

(5.18)

as well as m3 = m4. so even though the angular momentum in 2 + 1 gravity is a global

eect, it turns out to agree exactly with the four-dimensional angular momentum of the

black hole. this is directly analogous to what we found for the mass in the absence of

rotation [1], and can be understood by a similar argument. before introducing the brane,

the ads c-metric describes a black hole accelerating in ads. the cause of the acceleration

is a cosmic string pulling on the black hole. when the string is attached to a spinning

horizon, it is set into rotation. this rotation, like the conical decit angle, is a global

eect that can be detected on every section transverse to the axis. when the brane

is introduced, the cosmic string is removed, but the boundary conditions on the brane

essentially reproduce its eect. we expect that the agreement (5.18) continues to hold for

large ma.

5.2.  > 0: rotating btz black holes

when  > 0, the metrics on the brane (5.11) are related to those of rotating solutions

in ads3. in fact, if ma = 0 they are the same as btz black holes for k = +1, 0, and
negative mass particles for k = 1. thus, the mass and spin on the brane can be measured
by comparing to the spinning btz solution [5],

where  has periodicity 2 (for xed t).

the most important feature introduced by a nonzero value of the rotation parameter

a appears in the structure of g(x). notice that since g(x) is now a quartic polynomial we
are not guaranteed to always have a real root, even when m 6= 0. consider for instance
starting from a rotating btz black string (k = +1, m = 0), which extends throughout the

entire spacetime. now turn on a small, but nonzero m. when a = 0 we have seen that

this results in the string being chopped o at one of its ends, the endpoint being marked
by the smallest positive real root of g(x). however, when a 6= 0 there is a range of (small)
values of ma such that all roots of g(x) are still complex, so the range of x is unrestricted,
 < x <  (it becomes 0  x <  once the brane is introduced). therefore, for ma
within this range of values, we still nd a black string, which, runs from the brane at x = 0

to the brane at y = 0.

24

as we let ma grow larger we reach a certain critical value at which g(x) develops a

positive double root x2. then the proper spatial distance to x2, given as r x2 dx/pg(x),

is innite, so the black string has innite proper length now10. the string extends innitely

far even if we put a second brane at y = 0 to compactify spacetime. the way this can

happen is that this second brane also develops an innite funnel centered at the double

root x = x2. the black string then extends down this funnel. notice the period  can

still be arbitrarily chosen.

for larger values of ma, the function g(x) has real positive simple zeroes, and the

upper value for x is the smallest of these zeroes, which is now a nite proper distance away.

this marks the outermost extent of the black hole horizon inside the bulk. it is only in

this case that the period , and hence the mass on the brane, is xed (to the value (3.5))

once ma and a are xed. let us note that whether the horizon is extremal or not does

not appear to inuence the discussion of these issues.

these localized black holes also produce a three-dimensional angular momentum,

just as in the asymptotically at case,  = 0. the total angular momentum detected on

the brane is obtained by comparing the asymptotic geometry to (5.19). as we saw earlier,

a nonsingular rotation axis requires that the angular coordinate be identied periodically
on surfaces of constant t (5.8). so we change the time coordinate in (5.11) by t = t ax2
2
so that points now are identied as (t, , )  (t, ,  + ). it is easy to see that this
results in the coecient of the dtd growing like 2, instead of a constant, as in (5.19),

which might appear to imply a diverging angular momentum. this, however, is an artifact

of the coordinate system, and not a true global eect. to see this, notice that we can still
dene  =  + f (t, ) without changing the global identications. in particular, letting
 =   ax2
t we can remove the 2 term in dtd , and nally nd the asymptotic

for a small range of parameters (corresponding to x2 close to becoming a double root) t
becomes spacelike and  becomes timelike in (5.20). since  is periodic, these solutions

have closed timelike curves near innity and are presumably unphysical.

10 the area remains nite, though.

6. discussion

so far we have been considering black holes on branes with asymptotically at or ads

geometries. it is easy to extend the discussion to the case of  < 0, where the branes have

compact volume and the geometry of desitter universes. the analysis of the ads c-metric

in this case is quite straightforward, since apart from the dierent asymptotics at four-

dimensional innity, it is quite similar to the c-metric without a cosmological constant
(which corresponds to  = 1). setting k = 1, it follows that for small ma, h(y) has
two negative roots11. the smaller root corresponds to a black hole horizon of nite size

and the larger one is an acceleration horizon. the solution can be continued past the

acceleration horizon, to nd a second black hole accelerating in the opposite direction.

when ma grows to a value such that h(y) develops a double root, the black hole horizon

and the acceleration horizon coincide. limiting situations of this sort have been considered
in [18]. for larger values of ma the singularity at y =  is naked.

on the brane, for small ma we nd a black hole inside a ds3 universe. since there

are no black holes in 2 + 1 gravity with a positive cosmological constant, these are entirely

a result of the modications coming from the extra dimension. if the metric is continued

past the three-dimensional cosmological horizon, then we recover a second black hole, which

corresponds to the second black hole in ads4. the appearance of the naked singularity

as ma grows corresponds to the black hole horizon on the brane becoming coincident

with, and then larger than the cosmological horizon. we are not aware of any satisfactory

denition of mass in ds3, but we might expect (or dene) the mass of black holes on the

brane to be equal to the mass m4 computed from thermodynamics in the bulk.

we have seen in section 4.2 that the solutions we have constructed do not appear

to be the most general ones describing black holes on two-branes. in light of this, it is

natural to wonder if the existence of a maximum possible mass of order the planck scale

for a localized black hole on the brane (discussed in section 3.2) is just an artifact of our

family of solutions. while we do not know how to construct the most general solution,

we now comment on possible alternative locations of the branes in the ads c-metric. in

contrast to the situation where no black holes are present (and the branes can be placed

at any surface at constant x/y), when m > 0 the condition for the location of the branes 

that the extrinsic curvature be proportional to the induced metric  is highly restrictive.

above, we found it was possible to place the two-branes at x = 0 and y = 0. more

11 for simplicity we only discuss the non-rotating case.

26

generally, for the metrics (2.1), the equation k  g is solved on any surface x = xb
such that g(xb) = 0 and g(xb) 6= 0. similarly, it is solved on any surface y = yb with
h(yb) = 0 and h(yb) 6= 0. however it turns out that the resulting solutions are equivalent
to the ones already studied.

let us consider the case of constant nonzero x in more detail. for k = 1 it is
possible to place a brane at the second root of g(x), xb = k/3ma. however, one can
always shift coordinates so that the brane is at x = 0 in the new coordinates. dene

(6.1)

to convert the resulting metric into one of the same form as (2.1) we just have to redene

the parameters as

a =

,

k = k,

(6.2)

while leaving m unchanged. notice x = xb is mapped onto x = 0. one can also see
that the sign of  = 1 + 1/l2 a2 may be dierent to that of . for illustration, consider
placing a two-brane at xb = 1/3ma when  = 0 and k = 1. in order for xb to fall
into the range of variation of x, we must require ma > 1/33 (this also ensures  is
real) which is in a black string regime. the transformation above results into k = +1 and
 = 1/(27m2a2  1) > 0. conversely, if k = +1 and  = 1/27m2a2, then a two-brane at
x = 1/3ma is asymptotically at.

from our investigations in sections 3 and 4, we arrive at the following general picture:

for m3 > 1/24g3, a gravitationally collapsed system can only form a btz black string.

these black strings remain the stable conguration down to a certain transition mass,
m3  1/32g3 for small , where the minimum transverse size of the black string shrinks to
be of order the four-dimensional ads radius. (recall that our calculations of this transition

are reliable only for  < 1.) at around this mass, the black strings are destabilized by the

gregory-laamme instability [15], which causes them to break up and form a black hole

localized on the planck brane. in the small  regime, one nds that at the transition point
the localized black hole appears to have essentially the geometry of a large (horz  1/2)
btz black hole. that is, the 2ma/ corrections in eq. (3.6) are very small everywhere

outside of the event horizon.

in addition, at the transition point the horizon of these

27

localized black holes extends out in the transverse space to come very close to the throat
at r = 4. below the transition point down to m3 = 0, black holes localized on
the planck brane are the stable end-point of a gravitational collapse. this continues to
be true for 1/8g3 < m3 < 0, where these black holes are the only solutions with an
event horizon. as m3 approaches 1/8g3, these black holes resemble four-dimensional
schwarzschild ads black holes. at precisely m3 = 1/8g3, one is left with a slice of pure
ads4 in the bulk spacetime on either side of the branes.

by considering the instability of the black string, one is led to a general argument for

the sign of the correction terms to the gravitational potential on the brane. the following

argument applies in all dimensions, but to be denite, we consider the standard case of a

three brane in ads5. the usual four dimensional schwarzschild black hole can be realized

on the brane if the full solution is a black string [7]. when the black string is unstable,

it caps o its ends to form a localized black hole. but this will always decrease the total

horizon area unless the cross sectional area is increased at the same time. so if a localized

black hole is going to be stable, it must have larger horizon area on the brane than the

original schwarzschild solution of the same mass. this tells us the sign of the corrections

to the gravitational potential. that is, if we have

gtt = 1 + v (r) = 1 +

2gm

r

+ (cid:18) l

r(cid:19) 2gm

r

(6.3)

then we had better have  > 0 in order that the horizon be at a larger radius than

rh = 2gm . this agrees with the sign obtained from a perturbative calculation in [2] (see
also [13], [14]), and from our exact solutions in one lower dimension in section 3.

in light of the ads/cft correspondence, it has been suggested that the randall-

sundrum scenario can be viewed as a coupling of the lower dimensional gravity on the

brane to a strongly coupled conformal eld theory which is dual to gravity in the bulk [19].

for the case of negative curvature branes, there is the intriguing possibility that we could

apply this duality twice. since the theory on the brane is 2+1 ads gravity (coupled to a

2 + 1 cft), it may be equivalent in some sense to a 1 + 1 cft! in a sense, one may have

a holographic description of a holographic description of the theory.
