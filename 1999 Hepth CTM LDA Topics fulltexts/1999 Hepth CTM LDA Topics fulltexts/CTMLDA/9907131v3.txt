abstract

we consider d-branes wrapped around supersymmetric cycles of calabi-
yau manifolds from the viewpoint of n = 2 landau-ginzburg models with
boundary as well as by consideration of boundary states in the corresponding
gepner models. the landau-ginzburg approach enables us to provide a
target space interpretation for the boundary states. the boundary states
are obtained by applying cardys procedure to combinations of characters
in the gepner models which are invariant under spectral ow. we are able
to relate the two descriptions using the common discrete symmetries of the
two descriptions. we thus provide an extension to the boundary, the bulk
correspondence between landau-ginzburg orbifolds and the corresponding
gepner models.

i. introduction

dirichlet branes (d-branes), which are a simple realisation of ramond-ramond charged
solitonic objects in superstring theory, have played an important role in our understanding
of non-perturbative aspects of string theory [1]. among other things, they has played an
important role in the understanding of string duality and its relationship with m-theory,
analysis of stringy black holes, etc. d-branes as formulated in string theory admit a world-
sheet conformal eld theory (cft) description in contrast to the description of these objects
as solitonic p-branes encountered as solutions of the low-energy eective actions of string
theory.

the world-volume theories of d-branes have provided us with interesting examples of
supersymmetric gauge theories. in its simplest form, the world-volume spectrum of a at d-
brane is obtained by the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional super yang-mills theory.
one may also consider situations where some or all of the spatial directions of the d-brane
are wrapped around some cycle in a curved manifold that forms part of ten-dimensional
space-time. in order to preserve some supersymmetry it has to be ensured that the cycle is
actually a supersymmetric cycle [24]. in general, the bulk of the eort thus far has been
in understanding the cases where the curved manifold is obtained by a reasonably simple
modication of a at manifold including that of tori, and orbifolds of both tori and at
space.

however some progress has been made in providing a conformal eld theory description of
d-branes wrapped around supersymmetric cycles in calabi-yau spaces. the rst important
step was provided by the work of ooguri, oz and yin [5], who formulated the general
boundary conditions on the world-sheet n = 2 super conformal eld theory (scft) that
would be necessary to describe such cycles. subsequently using the work of cardy on
boundary cft [6], recknagel and schomerus [7] described in some generality the boundary
states in the so-called gepner models [8,9], that would be relevant to the description of both
even and odd dimensional supersymmetric cycles in the corresponding calabi-yau manifolds.
further in refs. [10] some applications of this construction have been pursued. a more
general construction of boundary states relevant to curved d-branes have also been pursued
by fuchs and schweigert [11]. in later work, recknagel and schomerus have also studied the
role of boundary operators in such constructions [12]. other approaches have studied the
case of d-branes in the context of group manifolds as described by wzw models [1315].
while this paper was in preparation, the important work of brunner, douglas, lawrence
and romelsberger [16] appeared that studied in detail the structure and several aspects of
d-branes on the quintic, using both gepner models and other techniques. we consider the
techniques of this paper to be complementary to the ideas and results contained therein.

in this paper, we pursue two dierent worldsheet approaches to understanding such
d-branes wrapped on supersymmetric cycles in calabi-yau manifolds. for simplicity we
restrict ourselves to the case where all the spatial coordinates are wrapped on the appropriate
supersymmetric cycle and hence from the viewpoint of the non-compact spacetime, we have
a zero-brane. from this point of view, the world-volume theory describes the moduli of the
corresponding d-brane wrapped on the cycle inside the calabi-yau manifold [3,4].

the two approaches that we use are the boundary n = 2 supersymmetric landau-
ginzburg (lg) formulation and a boundary state construction in terms of the gepner

1

model. the landau-ginzburg formulation of strings on calabi-yau manifolds has been
very successful in understanding various aspects of such closed string theories. we extend
this by considering the same lg models on worldsheets with boundary, in a manner that
preserves a n = 2 worldsheet supersymmetry on the boundary. we nd that these lg
models with boundary provide a natural description of d-branes wrapped on both even and
middle-dimensional supersymmetric cycles in the general calabi-yau manifold.

in the second description, we use the gepner model construction. however, in contrast
to other approaches mentioned earlier we consider linear combinations of characters of the
spacetime scft and the internal scft that are invariant under spectral ow. with this
approach we are able to construct the cylinder partition functions in a manner that ex-
plicitly demonstrates that some of spacetime supersymmetry is preserved and thus leads to
a vanishing partition function. the associated boundary states are constructed for these
partition functions. this is illustrated by the 13 and 22 gepner models that describe a
t 2 compactication. the approach that we use is closely related to the techniques that
have been used by the rome group to describe the construction of type-i strings using
gepner models [1720]. however we note that their formulation has not kept track of the
construction of d-brane states and their properties even though they have investigated the
question of anomaly cancellation and tadpole cancellation in some detail [1720]. we are
able to relate the boundary state construction to the boundary condition lg description by
making use of a common discrete symmetry group occurring in both the gepner model and
its corresponding lg orbifold.

we would like to emphasise the point of view taken throughout this paper. when we refer
to d-branes, we mean the object which the boundary cft describes. in some cases, this
coincides with the supergravity description of d-branes. however, this is not expected to be
generically true especially in the case of compactications on calabi-yau three-folds where
the large volume branes (these typically admit supergravity descriptions) may exhibit
rather dierent behaviour in the small volume limit. according to the modied geometric
hypothesis of douglas et al. [16], for the so called a-branes, i.e., d-branes which correspond
to a-type boundary conditions, the large volume results for central charges and masses
of a-branes do not get modied in the small volume limit. this is not so for the case of
b-branes, i.e., d-branes which correspond to b-type boundary conditions. based on this,
the geometric properties which we have extracted for the a-branes in section 4, which we
construct using the boundary state formalism, is expected to hold.

the paper is organised as follows. section 2 contains the necessary background and
the notation followed in the paper.
in section 3, we consider landau-ginzburg theories
in the presence of boundaries which preserve n = 2 supersymmetry. we obtain general
boundary conditions on the lg elds when n = 2 supersymmetry is preserved and relate
these to supersymmetric cycles. in section 4, we study d-branes in gepner models making
use of spectral ow invariant orbits. cardys prescription is used after suitably resolving
the s-matrix. the 13 and 22 models are analysed in detail though the analysis is more
general. we also attempt to use the lg formulation in order to obtain a spacetime picture
for the boundary states.
in section 5, we conclude with a discussion on open issues and
possible extensions of the work described in the paper.
in an appendix, we discuss the
transformations of the boundary states in the 22 gepner model under the action of the
discrete symmetry group of the model.

ii. background

a. the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra

the generators of the n = 2 super conformal algebra are the energy momentum tensor,
t (z) its worldsheet superpartners, g and g of conformal weight 3/2, and a u(1) current, j,
with conformal weight 1. the algebra is given by the following relations that can be derived
from the operator product expansions of the generators [21].

the parameter a  [0, 1). a = 0 corresponds to the ramond (r) algebra and a = 1
2
corresponds to the neveu-schwarz (ns) algebra. we shall refer to states in representations
of the ramond algebra as ramond states and similarly, one obtains neveu-schwarz states.
primary states of the n = 2 algebra are labelled by their dimension h and u(1) charge q.

a subset of the primary elds of the ns algebra are the chiral primary elds. which

create states that are annihilated by the operator g1/2, i.e,

where |i is the state created by a chiral primary eld . the dimension and u(1) charge
of a chiral primary eld satisfy

g1/2|i = 0

,

(2)

h =

q
2

.

(3)

anti-chiral elds creates states annihilated by g1/2 with h = q/2.
in a theory with (2, 2) worldsheet supersymmetry, i.e., theories with n = 2 supersym-
metry in the holomorphic(left-moving) and anti-holomorphic(right-moving) sectors, one can
construct four combinations of the chiral and anti-chiral elds. these are (c, c), (a, a), (c, a),
and (a, c) states in the theory.

an important aspect of the n = 2 algebra is the existence of a spectral ow isomorphism.

one can show that the after the following redenition:

the redened operators also satisfy the n = 2 algebra with a moding shifted by the parameter
 (a  a + ). this correspondence can be carried over to the states in the representation
of the algebra. this is done by means of the spectral ow operator u dened by

u = ei c

3 

,

(5)

where the u(1) current is given by j = iqc/3 z. the dimension and u(1) charge of the

new eld obtained by spectral ow of a primary eld with weight h and u(1) charge q is
given by

h = h + q +

q = q +

(6)

when  = 1
2, the spectral ow operator interpolates between the neveu-schwarz and the
ramond sectors. in the context of spacetime supersymmetric string theory, this spectral
ow relates spacetime bosons to spacetime fermions.

for a given representation p of the n = 2 algebra, the character is dened as

p (, z, u) = e2iu tr [e2izj0 e2i (l0 c

24 )]

(7)

where the trace runs over the particular representation denoted by p and u is an arbitrary
phase. the explicit formulae for the characters of certain models in terms of the jacobi theta
functions will be written down later. under spectral ow with parameter , the character
for the -shifted representation is given by

p (, z, 0) = tr [e2ij

b. boundary states for n=2 scft

a bps state such as a d-brane wrapped on a supersymmetric cycle will preserve half
the spacetime supersymmetry. using the correspondence between spacetime supersymmetry
and the existence of a global n = 2 supersymmetry on the worldsheet, the presence of a
bps state will be signalled by the boundary preserving a linear combination of the (2, 2)
worldsheet supersymmetry. the analysis of ooguri et al. shows that there are two possible

4

linear combinations [5].
a-type boundary condition:

j+ = j , g+ = g ,

ei+ = ei

b-type boundary condition:

j+ = j , g+ = g ,

ei+ = ()deiei

,

(9)

(10)

where the  are the scalars associated with the bosonisation of the u(1) current of the n =
2 supersymmetry algebra in the left and right-moving sectors. these boundary conditions
are for the open string channel.

boundary states which preserve a n = 2 supersymmetry are expected to be related to
d-branes wrapping around supersymmetric cycles. the boundary states satisfy the closed
string equivalent of the above boundary conditions. in order to do this, we write the bound-
ary conditions in the closed string channel with the replacement j  j, g  ig and
g  ig as compared to the open string channel. the a-type boundary condition then
reads,

(j+  j) |bi = 0

;

(cid:16)g+  ig(cid:17)|bi = 0 ,

(11)

where |bi is a boundary state. the condition on the u(1) current picks out a selection rule
for the elds of the theory that can contribute to the boundary state, namely for the a-type
boundary condition, corresponding to d-branes wrapping around middle dimensional cycles,
we have q+ = q for the u(1) charge. thus, the (c, c) and (a, a) states can contribute to the
a-type boundary state while the (a, c) and (c, a) states cannot. similarly, for the b-type
boundary condition

(j+ + j) |bi = 0 ;

(g+  ig) |bi = 0

(12)

implying that the (c, a) and (a, c) states contribute to the boundary state.

generalising a procedure due to ishibashi, one can construct solutions of the above
conditions for all primary elds which satisfy the condition involving the two u(1) charges
in addition to the condition on the conformal weights [22]. the explicit form of the ishibashi
state associated with such a representation a is given by

|aii = xn |a; ni  u|a; ni

(13)

where |a, ni is an orthonormal basis for the representation a and u is an anti-unitary matrix
which preserves the highest weight state |ai. for a-type boundary conditions, one has to
replace u with u where  is the mirror automorphism of the n = 2 algebra [7]. we shall
label the ishibashi states for the a-type and b-type boundary conditions by |aiia and |aiib
respectively.

we denote left-movers by the subscript + and right-movers by the subscript .

c. cardys construction

the set of ishibashi states form a basis for the boundary states. thus, any boundary

state |i is given by a linear combination of the ishibashi states

where s is the modular s-matrix and 0 refers to the identity operator. the 
arbitrary but will have to satisfy a consistency condition which we will now derive. the
arguments are due to cardy [6] but we will follow the discussion in ref. [23]. consider a
conformal eld theory associated with a chiral algebra on a cylinder with perimeter t and
length l subject to boundary conditions  and . the partition function of the system can
be calculated in two ways: one can consider the result as coming from periodic time t
evolution with the prescribed boundary conditions. topologically, this corresponds to an
annulus. the annulus partition function is given by

(15)

 denotes the number of times the irreducible representation i occurs in the spec-
where ni
trum of the hamiltonian h (which generates the time evolution) and q = et /l. an-
other way corresponds to treating the l direction as time and the partition function for time
evolution from the boundary state |i to the boundary state |i is given by

where q = e4l/t and the sum is over ishibashi states. on equating eqn.
(15) to the
modular transformation   1/ (with  = i2l/t ) of eqn. (16), one obtains the following
consistency condition:

ni

(17)

in the above, note that the sum is over ishibashi states while the index i is over characters of
all irreducible representations of the chiral algebra. note that these two are not necessarily
the same except for theories such as the one whose toroidal partition function is given by
the charge conjugation modular invariant combination.

it can be shown [23] that the matrices ni = (ni)

symmetries in the bulk. more general situations have been studied by fuchs and schweigert
[24]. a simple example which illustrates the general situation is the three-state potts model
[25].

cardy has provided a solution to the consistency equation (17) for theories whose toroidal
partition function is given by the charge conjugation invariant. he constructs boundary
states (and hence boundary conditions) corresponding to the representations a which appear
in the ishibashi states. let us label the corresponding boundary states by |ai given by

|ai =xb

(20)

the consistency condition now turns into the verlinde formula.

complications can arise in attempting to apply cardys results directly. one which we
will encounter is that dierent representations may have the same virasoro character. this
will show up as a multiplicity in the appearance of the characters in the toroidal partition
function. in addition, the s-matrix will not have several of its usual properties such as it
being symmetric and so on. in such cases, the s-matrix needs to be resolved. there is a
fairly general procedure due to fuchs, schellekens and schweigert which one uses to obtain
a resolved s-matrix which has its usual properties [26]. sometimes, however there exists
some discrete symmetry which distinguishes representations which have the same character.
in these cases, one can use the charge under the discrete symmetry to obtain a resolved (or
at least a partially resolved) s-matrix. we refer the reader to ref. [26] for the procedure to
resolve the s-matrix. in the case of gepner models, we will discover that this is the case
generically and we will need to resolve the s-matrix before using cardys solution to eqn.
(17).

d. brief review of gepner models

gepner models are exactly solvable supersymmetric compactications of type ii string
theory, where the internal part of the scft is constructed by tensoring together n = 2
minimal models. the central charge of the minimal model of level k is given by

c =

3k

k + 2

(21)

a simple construction of the minimal model of level k is realised by adding one free boson to
the zk parafermionic eld theory. this is done as follows: from the free bosonic theory with
the eld denoted by , and the zk parafermionic theory with parafermionic elds labelled
by 1 and its hermitian conjugate,

the operator product expansions for these generators satisfy the n = 2 super conformal
algebra. the primary elds of the theory are labelled by three integers l, m, s, and denoted
by l

m,s whose dimension h and u(1) charge q are given by are given by

h =

q =

l(l + 2)  m2
4(k + 2)

8

(23)

where l = 0, 1,   , k and m = (k + 1),k,   , (k + 2) mod (2k + 4) and s = 0, 2,1. the
labelling integers satisfy the constraint l + m + s  2z. in addition, there is an identication
given by (l, m, s)  (k  l, m + k + 2, s + 2). the n = 2 characters of the minimal models
are dened in terms of the usual jacobi theta functions as:

l(s)

m (, z, u) = xj mod k

c l

m+4js( )2m+(4js)(k+2),2k(k+2) (, 2kz, u)

(24)

where n,m(, z, u) denotes the jacobi theta function, and the c l
m( ) are the characters of
the parafermionic eld theory. the characters l(s)
m have the property that they are invariant
under s  s + 4 and m  m + 2(k + 2) and are zero if l + m + s 6= 0 mod 2. by using
the properties of the theta functions, the modular transformation of the minimal model
characters is found to be

l(s)

(25)

where in the above sum one imposes l + m + s = 0 mod 2 and c is a constant.

gepner constructed compactications of the heterotic string which had spacetime super-
symmetry by representing the internal part by a tensor product of n = 2 minimal models.
his considerations are equally applicable for compactications of the type ii string. con-
sider the tensor product of n minimal models of level ki (i = 1,   , n). the total central
charge of the internal model is given by

cint =

nxi=1

3ki

ki + 2

,

(26)

where cint = 15 3d/2, where d is the dimensionality of spacetime. thus, for d = 4, cint = 9.
gepner constructs a spacetime supersymmetric partition function by rst projecting onto
states for which total u(1) charges in both the left-moving and right-moving sectors is an
odd integer. then, in order to preserve n = 1 worldsheet supersymmetry, the ns sector
states of each sub-theory are coupled to each other and do not mix with the r sector states.
he thus multiplies all the ns sector partition functions in each sub-theory and similarly

ns sector (ns = trn s ql0c/24) while r refers to the virasoro character in the r sector

for other sectors i.e, gns, r and er. here, ns refers to the virasoro character in the
(r = trr ql0c/24). gns and er refer to the virasoro characters in the appropriate sector with
the inclusion of ()f , where f is the worldsheet fermion number (gns = trn s ()f ql0c/24).

8

the full partition function is a sum of the contributions from the four sectors. modular
invariance of the full partition function is a consequence of modular invariance in each of
the sub-theories.

a related construction due to eguchi et al. makes use of supersymmetric characters
in order to construct modular invariant partition functions for gepner models [28]. the
analysis of gepner showed the relationship between spacetime supersymmetry and spectral
ow with  = 1
2 in the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra. the supersymmetric character is
obtained by rst constructing the virasoro character in the neveu-schwarz (ns) sector and
then including all characters (whose states are related to the original one by spectral ow
in steps of  = 1
2). for example, the graviton character is obtained by rst considering the
identity operator. then, one applies the spectral ow operation once to obtain a state in the
ramond sector. the second application leads one back to the ns sector. this procedure is
repeated until one returns to the original state after a few iterations. the supersymmetric
character (in the lightcone gauge) can be written as

xi =

1

2(nsi 3
!m

(27)

!m
 gns i  4

 !m
 ri  2

 !m) ,

+ eri  1

where ( 
 )m come from level one so(2m) characters associated with the non-compact space-
time of dimension d(with m = (d  2)/2). the signs reect the gso projection required
in order to obtain the correct spin-statistics connection. as a consequence of spacetime
supersymmetry, each supersymmetric character vanishes identically. see ref. [8,9] for the
details of the argument.

the modular invariant partition function on a torus for a type ii string compactied
on a gepner model is now constructed as follows. one rst constructs the supersymmetric
character x0 associated with the graviton (this is associated with the identity operator in the
gepner model). one then obtains all other characters xi (i = 1,   , r) which are obtained
by applying the s :    1
 modular transformation to x0, the graviton character. then,
one constructs a modular invariant bilinear combination from the full set of characters thus
obtained. in the sequel, we will restrict ourselves to the case where the partition function
on the torus (for the type ii string compactied on a calabi-yau given by a gepner model)
is given by the following modular invariant combination

t =

rxi=0

di |xi|2

,

(28)

where di = s0i
si0
function.

is the multiplicity with which character xi occurs in the torus partition

e. landau-ginzburg description of gepner models

there is a lot of evidence that the level k n = 2 minimal model can be obtained as the
rg xed point of a landau-ginzburg model (with global n = 2 supersymmetry)of a single
scalar supereld with superpotential k+2. it has been shown that the central charge of the
rg xed point matches that of the minimal model and more recently, the elliptic genus of
the two theories was shown to match [27].

1 + k2+2

2 +   kn+2

the massless spectra and symmetries of certain gepner models are in one to one corre-
spondence with those obtained in some calabi-yau compactications [8,9]. this result was
initially shown by gepner for the quintic hypersurface in cp 4 which is equivalent to the
(k = 3)5 gepner model. for this example, it was shown in ref. [29] that certain yukawa
couplings between the massless elds also agreed from both sides. the explanation of this
phenomenon came rst by a path integral argument due to greene et. al [30]. using the
relationship between the level k n = 2 minimal model and the the lg theory with superpo-
tential k+2, for the gepner model given by (k1, k2, ...kn), they chose the lg superpotential
w (1, 2,   n) = k1+2
. assuming that the d terms in the theory are
irrelevant operators and their eect can be neglected in the path integral for this model, it
was shown in ref. [30] that one exactly ends up with the constraint that denes a calabi-yau
manifold in weighted projective space. there was a need to impose a discrete identication
in order to make the argument work. this corresponds to an orbifolding of the lg model
and gives rise to the integer projection imposed by gepner in order to have spacetime su-
persymmetry. thus the precise statement is that the gepner model is equivalent to the
lg orbifold. the calabi-yau - landau-ginzburg correspondence was later proved more
rigourously by witten [31] where it was shown how a varying kahler parameter interpolates
between the geometrical (calabi-yau) and the non-geometrical (landau-ginzburg) phases.
for instance the string vacuum that corresponds to ve copies of the k = 3 n = 2
minimal model, is obtained by orbifolding by exp[i2j0], where j0 measures the left u(1)
charge. other more complicated orbifolding possibilities exist (and lead to other calabi-yau
manifolds) but we will not need to consider other possibilities in this paper. a n = 2 lg
theory which has not been orbifoldized contains only (c, c) and (a, a) states. however, in
order that a lg description of a n = 2 super conformal eld theory reproduce the string
vacuum it is essential that it also include the (a, c) states. these states appear in the twisted
sector of the lg orbifold [32,33].

iii. d-branes in landau-ginzburg models

in this section, we will describe d - branes wrapped on supersymmetric cycles using
the landau-ginzburg description of calabi-yau manifolds. we will rst generalise the bulk
landau-ginzburg theory by including boundary terms which preserve part of the worldsheet
supersymmetry following the work of warner [34]. we will obtain the analog of a and b
type boundary conditions in this system. for the case of the quintic, we will show that a-
type boundary conditions naturally choose a real submanifold which is the supersymmetric
three-cycle constructed by becker et al. [2].

we will consider the massive euclidean landau-ginzburg theory in two dimensions,
with complex bosons i and complex dirac fermions denoted by , , with the left and right
moving components denoted by the subscripts + and  respectively. the action for the
model (in which we have taken the boundary to lie on the line x0  x = 0 and x1  y) is
given by

s = sbulk + sboundary

in the above w () is a quasi-homogeneous superpotential. as is usual for theories with

we have included an explicit boundary term following the work of warner [34].. we have
used an o diagonal basis where the two dimensional  matrices are dened by

this action is now varied under ordinary and supersymmetric variation, giving rise to bound-

further, let us assume that the fermions also satisfy the following condition:

(+i  i)|x=0 = 0

(36)

(37)

the following set of boundary conditions on the bosonic elds makes the action invariant
under the n = 2 supersymmetry. the bosonic boundary conditions are also consistent with
the supersymmetric variation of the fermionic boundary condition in eqn. (37).

0(cid:16)i  i(cid:17) |x=0 = 0
1(cid:16)i + i(cid:17) |x=0 = 0
i!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=0
  w
i

w

(38)

one can also choose + =  here.
since j+ = j for a-type boundary conditions, we are not permitted to set +i + i = 0 on
the boundary. thus one has to choose (+i  i) = 0 on the boundary.

12

hence (37) and (38) give us a set of boundary conditions on the elds such that we have an
unbroken n = 2 supersymmetry on the boundary. the last line of the eqn. (38) has to be
viewed as a consistency condition on the boundary condition. it has a simple interpretation
(in the infrared limit) provided the equation w = 0 admits a pure imaginary solution. it
corresponds to the statement that for directions along the brane, the variation of w has
to vanish. for example, for a circle given by f (x, y) = (x2 + y2  1) = 0, the analogous
statement is that f = 0, where  is the angle in cylindrical polar coordinates. we will see
that similar conditions appear even for b-type boundary conditions whenever a neumann
boundary condition is imposed on elds.

these mixed boundary conditions should correspond to a d- brane wrapped on some
cycle of calabi-yau given by the equation w () = 0. let us see if this can be substantiated.
notice that, the last of the equations in (38) implies that the real part of all the complex
scalar elds i can be chosen to vanish on the boundary at x = 0. thus, the target space
interpretation is that the cycle corresponds to a submanifold of the calabi-yau given by
the coordinates becoming imaginary on the boundary. as shown in [2], for the quintic
hypersurface dened in cp 4 by the equation

5

i=1 (i)5 = 0 ,

(39)

imposing the reality (or equivalently pure imaginary) condition on all the i indeed provides
one with a submanifold which is a supersymmetric three-cycle.

actually, (37) and (38) are not the most general choice of boundary conditions. the

following set of boundary conditions is more general:

(+i  ai
0(cid:16)i  ai
1(cid:16)i + ai
 ai
j w
j 

w

j j)|x=0 = 0
j j(cid:17)|x=0 = 0
j j(cid:17)|x=0 = 0
i!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=0

= 0

,

(40)

where the symmetric matrix a satises aa = 1 and it is block diagonal i.e., it does not mix
elds with dierent charge under the u(1) of the unbroken n = 2 supersymmetry algebra.
one simple choice is given by a = diag(ei1,   , ein) subject to the condition involving the
superpotential being satised.
given a matrix a which provides boundary conditions consistent with the superpotential,
we can construct other consistent choices. let us assume that the superpotential is invariant
under a discrete group g which acts holomorphically on the elds. let gi = gi
jj be the the
action of g  g. the invariance of the superpotential under g implies that w () = w (g).
corresponding to the element g, we can construct another n = 2 preserving boundary
condition on the elds given by ag = g1  a  g. clearly, if g is a real matrix, then a and
ag belong to the same conjugacy class and we do not obtain new boundary conditions.

we will nevertheless refer to this as real submanifold.

13

clearly with a lg theory it would be dicult to provide a description of the boundary
states in the cylinder channel with the same degree of explicitness that we can associate
with free-eld theories. however we can notice the following. we can label the boundary
states by the primary elds associated with them as in the general case discussed by cardy
and implemented by recknagel and schomerus. since for the a-type boundary condition,
one needs equal charges from the left and right moving sectors in the construction of the
boundary state, it is clear that the lowest states are associated with the application of the
lg elds themselves on the ground state vacuum of the theory. it is clear that this may
involve appropriate number of  elds, such that the u(1) charge projection condition is
satised, a similar set of states with the application of  elds and also states built by
application of both  and  elds such that they have integral u(1) charge. some of these
states will be obviously in the massive sector and will not contribute to massless states but
as we shall see later such states are required in the general denition of the boundary state.
this ties in rather nicely with the method for the construction of boundary states that we
will pursue in section iv of the paper. in this connection we note also that so far we have
no means yet, strictly within the lg formulation, to determine the normalization of the
boundary states as is done by the method of cardy for the boundary states of an arbitrary
minimal model.

b. b-type boundary conditions

again, following the earlier analysis, for b-type boundary conditions the n = 2 super-

symmetry is given by

+ =  .

(41)

we will now look for boundary conditions on the elds such that the above supersymmetry
is preserved.

under supersymmetry variation of the action, (after setting + =  as required), we

obtain a boundary term of the form

z 



dy

nh0i(cid:16)i  +i(cid:17)  i1i(cid:16)i + +i(cid:17)i +
+ h0i (+i  i) + i1i (+i + i)i +o

the vanishing of the above boundary term suggests two possible boundary conditions:

(42)

1. 0i|x=0 = 0 and (i + +i)|x=0 = 0. this corresponds to neumann boundary condi-
tions on the eld i and its complex conjugate i. consistency with supersymmetry
imposes the additional condition w
i |x=0 = 0. note that this is a condition in spacetime
where it says that the tangential derivative along the boundary vanishes.

2. 1i|x=0 = 0 and (i  +i)|x=0 = 0. this corresponds to dirichlet boundary condi-

tions on the eld i and its complex conjugate i.

since the above set of boundary conditions treat both the real and imaginary parts of the
complex scalar elds i in identical fashion, the cycle which is chosen by the boundary

14

conditions will correspond to a holomorphic submanifold of the calabi-yau. thus the cycle
is a supersymmetric cycle.

again, one can construct a general boundary condition. it is specied by a hermitian
matrix b which satises b2 = 1 and is block diagonal i.e., it does not mix elds with
dierent charge under the u(1) of the unbroken n = 2 supersymmetry algebra. the general
boundary condition is given by

(+i + bi
0(i + bi
1(i  bi
  w
+ b
i

i

jj)|x=0 = 0 ,
jj)|x=0 = 0 ,
jj)|x=0 = 0 ,
j w
= 0

j!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=0

(43)

since b squares to one, its eigenvalues are 1. an eigenvector of b with eigenvalue of +1
corresponds to a neumann boundary condition and 1 corresponds to a dirichlet boundary
condition.
what would b-type boundary states look like with dirichlet or neumann boundary
conditions on the lg elds? with neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions it is easy to
see that the u(1) current obeys boundary conditions that require all boundary states to
have equal and opposite charges in the left and right moving sectors. this implies that all
the boundary states for such cycles must come from the twisted sector in the lg theory. it
is not immediately clear what dierence the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions
would make since in the twisted sector the zero-mode of the lg elds are no longer present.
however it is nevertheless clear that the even supersymmetric cycles are charged under the
ramond-ramond ground states of the twisted sector. before we turn to specic examples we
would like to add that all the massless states could probably be constructed by an extension
of the method of kachru and witten [35] where they used the cohomology of the q+ charge
to dene the massless states in the left-moving sector of a (2,2) compactication of the
heterotic string. in the case of d-branes, in the open string sector, we have only one l0
operator and two supercharges. it is clear that an extension of the methods of ref. [35] will
be possible [42].

c. examples

we have seen that a-type boundary conditions in the lg model are specied by a
matrix a and similarly by a matrix b for b-type boundary conditions. the choices of these
boundary conditions is not arbitrary. one has to in particular ensure that the consistency
conditions involving the superpotential are satised. in all the examples that we consider,
for b-type boundary conditions, we are unable to impose neumann boundary conditions on
all elds simultaneously. this is illustrated by considering a simple example involving one
scalar eld (like the lg model associated with the n = 2 minimal model at level k). the
only consistent boundary condition one can impose in this case is the dirichlet one.

15

1. the 13 model

this model is described by the superpotential involving three scalar elds given by w =
1 + 3
3). a-type boundary conditions pick out the submanifold (one-cycle) given by

2 + 3

(3

(x3

1 + x3

2 + x3

3) = 0 ,

where xi = imi. the discrete symmetry group of this superpotential is given by g =
(s3  (z3)3)/z3
. other supersymmetric cycles which can be constructed from this cycle
are (ix1, iax2, ibx3), where a and b are integers satisfying a + b = 0 mod 3. these
correspond to choosing a = diag(1, a, b). thus, we end up with three z3 related cycles
corresponding to a = b = 0, a = 1, b = 2 and a = 2, b = 1 respectively. one can verify that
the three one-cycles are non-intersecting.

there exists another choice for a given by a1 = diag[1, 1, exp(i2/3)], which leads to

the one-cycle given by

(x3

1 + x3

2  x3

3) = 0 ,

where xi = imi (i = 1, 2), x3 = im(exp(i/3)3). by studying the action of s3 on this
cycle, we will see that this cycle is not chosen in the gepner model construction.
earlier, we had imposed the condition a + b = 0 mod 3 in the matrix a. relaxing this
condition, we will get two more sets of one-cycles corresponding to a+b = 1, 2 mod 3. within
each set, the one-cycles are non-intersecting. however, if one considers one-cycles from
dierent sets, they can intersect. for example, the one-cycle chosen by a = diag(1, 1, 1)
intersects the one-cycle chosen by a = diag(1, , ) at the point (0, 1, 1)  (0, , ) in
homogeneous coordinates. the cylinder amplitude between these two states will not vanish
since the two boundary states do not preserve the same supersymmetry generators. further,
one expects to see a tachyon in the open string spectrum.

for b-type boundary conditions, we nd the following consistent choices:

1. choose b = diag(1,1,1) which corresponds to dirichlet boundary conditions on
all scalars. let i = ci where ci are constants. presumably, they will have to satisfy
(c3
3) = 0 given the infrared limit of the bulk theory but this does not follow from
the consistency conditions. clearly (c1, c2, c3) corresponds to a point (in homogeneous
coordinates) on the torus and corresponds to a supersymmetric zero-cycle.

2+c3

1+c3

2. for b = 

0 1
0
0
1
0
0 1
0

, the consistency conditions imply that 1 + 2 = 0 and

3 = 0 with (1  2) being free i.e., satisfying neumann boundary conditions.

s3 is the permutation group with three elements (here it permutes the three elds), the three
z3s are generated by the action i  i (for i = 1, 2, 3). ( is a non-trivial cube root of unity.)
the quotient z3 is the diagonal z3.

this condition comes from requiring that the discrete symmetry generator commute with the
supersymmetry generator.

16

we are unable to nd choices for b such that one obtains two neumann and one dirichlet
boundary condition in addition to the all neumann case which can be clearly ruled out by
analysing the consistency condition involving the superpotential.

2. the 22 model

this model is described by the superpotential w = 4

3, where we have included
a trivial quadratic piece. for a-type boundary conditions given by a = 1, there are no
real solutions. however, choosing a = diag(1, i, 1), one obtains the one-cycle given by the
equation

2 + 2

1 + 4

1  x4
x4

2 + x2

3 = 0 ,

where x1 = im1 , x2 = im(2/i) and x3 = im3. this equation has solutions for real
xi. the discrete symmetry group of this model is given by g = (s2  (z4)2  z2)/z4.
choosing an element of g given by g = (ia, ib, ()c) with a + b + 2c = 0 mod 4. by following
the procedure mentioned earlier we obtain ag = diag[()a, i()b, 1] which provides cycles
related to a = diag(1, i, 1) by a z2 subgroup.
there is another choice given by a2 = diag(1, 1,1), one obtains the one-cycle given by

the equation

x4
1 + x4

2  x2

3 = 0 ,

where x1 = im1 , x2 = im2 and x3 = re3. again, this one-cycle is not chosen by the
gepner model model construction. this cycle is invariant under the s2 exchange while the
rst choice is not invariant.

3. the quintic

we have already seen the example of a real three-cycle obtained from the a-type bound-
ary conditions with a = 1. the quintic has a discrete symmetry group g = (s5(z5)5/z5).
a subgroup is given by the z5 generated by

g : (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  (1, 2, 23, 34, 45)

,

where  is any non-trivial fth root of unity. this boundary condition corresponds to a
three-cycle of the quintic which is related to the real three-cycle by the z5 transformation.
it follows trivially that this cycle is a special lagrangian submanifold of the deformed quintic
and hence a supersymmetric cycle. it is clear that this procedure leads to the construction
of supersymmetric cycles. considering the full group g, one can generate g-related super-
symmetric cycles by the choice g = diag(1, a, b, c, d), where a, b, c, d are integers which
satisfy a + b + c + d = 0 mod 5.

for b-type boundary conditions, we nd the following three consistent choices for the

matrix b: (i) b1 = diag(1,1,1,1,1); (ii) b2 = (cid:18)1

1
0
0

133(cid:19) and (iii) b3 =

dirichlet one. the second choice has one neumann and four dirichlet conditions and the
last one has two neumann and three dirichlet conditions on some linear combinations of
the elds.

the deformed conifold is described by a non-compact calabi-yau associated with the

where  = 0 is the conifold limit and  = ||ei is complex. imposing a-type boundary
conditions with a = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, e2i) chooses the three-cycle given by the equation (xi =
imi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and x5 = im(5ei))

working in inhomogeneous coordinates yi = xix5, we obtain an s3 of radiusq|| which is

known to be a special lagrangian submanifold of the conifold and hence is a supersymmetric
cycle [3840].

iv. d-branes in gepner models

in this section we will be constructing the boundary states associated with cycles of a
calabi-yau space which can be obtained as a gepner model. the calabi-yau is specied
by tensoring together n = 2 minimal models and truncating to states with integer charge
under the u(1) of the n = 2 supersymmetry.

the partition function on a torus for a type ii string compactied on a calabi-yau

manifold given by a gepner model is given by [28]

t =

rxi=0

di |xi|2

,

(44)

where di = s0i
si0
the torus partition function and x0 is the graviton character.

is the multiplicity with which the supersymmetric character xi occurs in

since the multiplicities di are generically not equal to one, one needs to resolve the
s-matrix associated with the gepner model. there is a procedure due to fuchs, schellekens
and schweigert which we employ to resolve the s-matrix [26]. the cardy prescription can
then be applied to the resolved s-matrix in order to obtain the boundary states corresponding
to d-branes wrapped around cycles of the calabi-yau corresponding to the gepner model.
the resolution of the s-matrix for models such as the quintic is computationally complex
and hence we will illustrate the procedure for the simple case of the 13 and 22 gepner
models (for a-type boundary conditions). here, we will see a very nice match with respect
to the analysis using the lg description and hence be able to directly achieve a target space
interpretation for the boundary states.

18

we should point out the dierences between our approach and that of recknagel and
schomerus. in their construction, the boundary conditions such as j+ = j are imposed
separately in each of the minimal models which enters the theory after which they construct
boundary states for by tensoring together boundary states of the individual minimal models.
thus, the boundary is forced to preserve the n = 2 algebra of each minimal model rather
than the diagonal n = 2. this seems to ensure that the setting is rational.
in our
construction, we work with spectral ow invariant orbits. given the intimate relationship
between spacetime supersymmetry and spectral ow, our restriction may seem natural in the
context of d-branes since they are bps states in spacetime. the supersymmetric characters
can be seen to be sums of characters of the extended algebra w, one obtains by including
the  = 1
2 spectral ow operator to the n = 2 algebra [28]. thus, our boundary states
preserve the extended algebra w rather than the n = 2 of the individual minimal models.
rationality is obtained because we work with only a nite number of supersymmetric
characters rather than characters of the irreducible representations of w. we believe that
these two approaches complement each other and must not be considered to be distinct.

a. the 13 gepner model

this 13 gepner model is obtained by the tensoring of three copies of the k = 1 n = 2
minimal model. this is the gepner model for a torus at its su(3) point. the characters of
the k = 1 minimal model in the ns sector will be labelled as follows. (l

)

b is associated with a chiral primary state and bc is associated with an anti-chiral primary
state. under spectral ow(with  = 1), we have the sequence

the spectral ow invariant orbits for this model in the ns sector are

a  b  bc  a

label
ns0 a3 + b3 + b3
c
ns1 3abbc

q; h

q = h = 0
q = 0; h = 1
3

in the above table, the values of q and h correspond to the state with the smallest value of
h occurring in the spectral ow invariant ns orbit. ns0 is the graviton orbit and the other
orbit is massive i.e., it corresponds to massive states in the non-compact spacetime. the
choice of 3abbc rather than abbc as the character for the ns1 state can be understood as
follows: let us assume that the three minimal models are labelled 1, 2, 3 respectively. then
a spectral ow invariant orbit is given by (a1b2bc3 + b1bc2a3 + bc1a2b3), where we have

19

explicitly kept the minimal model label. getting rid of these labels leads to 3abbc and
hence our choice. the s-matrix for this model is derived to be

s =

2

1

3(cid:18) 1

1 1(cid:19)

d0 = 1 and d1 = 2. it is sucient to consider the ns sector to obtain the s-matrix. one
can show that this s-matrix is identical to that obtained from the modular transformation
of the full supersymmetric character [8,9]. a modular invariant torus partition function for
this model is given by

t =

1xi=0

di |xi|2

(45)

where xi are the supersymmetric characters.

however, as things stand one cannot apply cardys prescription here since the character
x1 occurs with multiplicity 2 in the toroidal partition function.
in order to obtain the
resolved s-matrix, one splits d1 = 2 = 1 + 1. thus the resolved s-matrix is a 3  3 matrix.
it is

1

es =

(46)

where  is a cube root of unity. this resolved s-matrix is the s-matrix for the su(3) level
k = 1 wess-zumino-witten model which is consistent with the fact that this gepner model
corresponds to compactication on a torus at its su(3) point. one can check that:

 is the charge conjugation matrix.

 es2 = c where c =
 es is symmetric and unitary.
 es4 = 1.
 (est )3 = es2 with t = diag(i,i,i).
let |0iia, |1iia, |1ciia be the ishibashi states (associated with the characters x0, x1, x c
1)
which satisfy a-type boundary conditions. we apply cardys procedure using the resolved
s-matrix and obtain the following boundary states

the multiplicity of two associated with n s1 again is related to the fact that if we kept track
of the minimal model labels, there are two distinct spectral ow invariant orbits given by the
even permutation n s1 = (a1b2bc3 + b1bc2a3 + bc1a2b3) and the odd permutation n sc
1 =
(b1a2bc3 + bc1b2a3 + a1bc2b3). this actually completely resolves the s-matrix here. in more
complicated situations, this will enable us to partially resolve the s-matrix.

20

|0i = 31/4 (|0iia + |1iia + |1ciia)
|1i = 31/4(cid:16)|0iia + |1iia + 2|1ciia(cid:17)
|2i = 31/4(cid:16)|0iia + 2|1iia + |1ciia(cid:17)

(47)

(48)

(49)

note that if we kept track of the minimal model labels, under the exchange of labels 2 
3, |1iia  |1ciia. thus, under the same exchange |1i  |2i with the state |0i being
invariant. these boundary states t in beautifully with the analysis of the 13 model in the
lg description. there we obtained a set of a-type boundary conditions parametrised by
a = diag(1, a, b) with a + b = 0 mod 3. we make the following correspondence: the
a = b = 0 boundary condition is identied with the state |0i and (a, b) = (1, 2), (2, 1) with
the other two boundary states (using properties of these b.c.s under the 2  3 exchange in
the lg model)
a more direct correspondence can be worked out by considering the part of the boundary
state involving only the (c, c) and (a, a) states. following the analysis in the lg orbifold,
the boundary condition given by the matrix a = diag(1, a, b) corresponds to multiplying
the (a, a) eld by the phases given in a. let ( 1, 2, 3) be the generators of the (a, a) ring.
multiplying this by a, one sees that |0iia  |0iia, |1iia  a|1iia and |1ciia  b|1ciia,
where we have used a + b = 0 mod 3. thus, these boundary states are related to d1-branes
of the type iib string wrapping around non-intersecting supersymmetric one-cycles on the
torus at the su(3) point as follows from the lg analysis of the earlier section. we can
also compare with the result of recknagel and schomerus. the nine states they obtain for
this model can be grouped into sets of three. the grouping is chosen by the condition that
within each set, the same spacetime supersymmetry is preserved by all states. thus, within
a set, o-diagonal cylinder amplitudes should vanish by supersymmetry. the three states
we construct belong to one set.

it is easy to verify that the cylinder partition function cii = 31/2(x0 + x1 + x c

1). this
reects the z3 relationship between the three supersymmetric cycles. under a modular
transformation, the annulus partition function we obtain is given by aii = x0. this im-
plies that ni
00 = i0 i.e, only the identity sector propagates in the vacuum channel. both
amplitudes vanish as required by supersymmetry. finally, the annulus amplitude a0i = xi.
thus, we see that the massive character x1 is related to o-diagonal d-brane congurations
(i.e., a d-brane conguration that begins at one boundary and ends at another).

b. the 22 gepner model

this gepner model describes a torus at the su(2)su(2) point. the characters of the

k = 2 minimal model in the ns sector will be labelled as follows. (l

the other choice of boundary condition given by a1 = diag(1, 1, exp[i2/3]) is ruled out because
the equation for the one-cycle is clearly not invariant under the 2  3 exchange.

d0 = 1, d1 = 1 and d2 = 2.

in order to resolve the xed point ambiguity, we need to split the d2 as the sum of

this resolved s-matrix is the s-matrix for the so(4) level k = 1 wess-zumino-witten
model which is again consistent with the symmetry associated with the spacetime torus

identity matrix.

corresponding to this gepner model. as one can see, es is symmetric and squares to the
now, one can apply cardys procedure using the resolved s-matrix. let |0iia, |1iia
|2+iia, |2iia be the ishibashi states associated with the characters x0, x1, x2, which sat-
isfy a-type boundary conditions. then cardys formula leads to the following four boundary
states:

|0i = 21/2(cid:16)|0iia + |1iia + |2+iia + |2iia(cid:17)
|1i = 21/2(cid:16)|0iia + |1iia  |2+iia  |2iia(cid:17)
|2i = 21/2(cid:16)|0iia  |1iia  |2+iia + |2iia(cid:17)
|3i = 21/2(cid:16)|0iia  |1iia + |2+iia  |2iia(cid:17)

we thus obtain four boundary states. these four states are related to each other by an
s2  z2 subgroup of the discrete symmetry group. the z2 is the same one which gave
dierent one-cycles in the lg description. the boundary state |0i can be identied with
the boundary condition corresponding to a = diag(1, i, 1). we relegate to the appendix the
detailed discussion as to how the other choice for a is ruled out.

which is equal to the gs calculation for (l
2) = (1, 1). interestingly, there does not seem
to be a consistent boundary state which can give rise to the (l
2) = (1, 0). for example,
there is a state given by the combination of ishibashi states |0iia + |1iia which cannot be
written as an integer sum of the four boundary states we have constructed. this state gives
the annulus amplitude for (l
2) = (1, 0) but is ruled out by its incompatibility with eqn.
(17).

c. the 16 gepner model

in order to illustrate the increase in the degree of complexity, we consider the simplest
non-toroidal model: the 16 gepner model. this corresponds to one of the orbifold points in
k3 moduli space. the notation for the k = 1 characters are as in the 13 model.

ns0 corresponds to the graviton orbit, ns1 is a massless orbit and ns2, ns3 are massive
orbits.
in the above table, by multiplicity we mean the number of distinct orbits which
occur if we keep track of the minimal model labels.

the s-matrix is calculated from the s-matrix of the minimal model to be

d0 = 1, d1 = 20, d2 = 30 and d3 = 30. the resolved s-matrix is expected to be an
81  81 matrix which increases the complexity of the operation. however, in this example,
if one keeps track of the minimal model labels, one should in principle be able to directly
compute the resolved s-matrix. this is because we nd that the multiplicity is equal to
the di associated with the orbit. this is not generically true. this model is presumably
tractable if one uses a computer program to automate the process.

v. discussion and conclusions

in this paper, we have studied d-branes wrapped around supersymmetric cycles using
boundary lg as well as boundary cft formulations. the lg formulation is suitable for
understanding the boundary conditions from the target space viewpoint while the boundary
cft formulation provides the corresponding boundary state. the common discrete sym-
metry group associated with both the lg orbifold and the corresponding gepner model has
been a useful tool in relating boundary conditions to boundary states. it also suggests that
the boundary states constructed by recknagel and schomerus by tensoring boundary states
for the individual minimal models may be further classied by means of charges associated
with the discrete symmetry group. in our method, this is also seen through the resolution
of the s-matrix of the gepner model.

clearly it is important to extend the program of studying closed string vacua for calabi-
yau compactications involving the use of lg models and the general structure of n=2
superconformal theories to the case of d-brane states. in relation to the approach to this
problem that we have adopted in this paper the following points are worth noting:

i) we need to extend the use of the landau-ginzburg model techniques so that more
relevant information can be extracted. as has been noted by other authors, this may involve
the extension of the methods of the n = 2 topological eld theory techniques to the case of
boundary n = 2 scfts. in particular, index calculations of various kinds may be performed
in the lg model using purely free-eld techniques by extension of similar techniques used in
the closed string case [27]. for example, it would be useful to compute the tr(1)f in the
ramond sector of the open string by such techniques and compare them to the calculations
of ref. [16].

ii) it is clear that some information on the boundary states can be obtained even if
they will not approach the level of detail that is characteristic of the at space case. in this
connection, as we have emphasised earlier, our construction of boundary states in the case of
the gepner models uses a modular transformation matrix that acts on the conformal blocks
that are basically spectral ow invariant orbits. clearly this construction carries a lesser

24

amount of detail than the boundary state construction of ref. [7] but could well make more
transparent the connection between the boundary states in the tensor product of minimal
models and the boundary states in the lg approach.

iii) the construction that we have used here for the boundary states seems a priori di-
cult to extend to the case of k3 and calabi-yau three-fold compactications. in particular
the xed point resolution would appear to be hopelessly complicated even in the simplest
cases. but since the resolution would involve presumably no more than the use of the full
symmetry of the model it might be possible to solve the problem by computer techniques.
in such a situation, the results presented for the t 2 in this paper would be extendable to the
case of compactications like the quintic calabi-yau. the diagonal partition functions (that
is between identical branes) in the cylinder channel and hence in the annulus channel are
however known even despite the xed point resolution even in the complicated cases by our
construction. its extension to non-diagonal cases by our methods would be of considerable
interest.

iv) it is of interest to see whether the lg-cy correspondence shown by witten by making
use of linear sigma models will go through for the case of linear sigma models with boundary
[41]. in this paper, we introduced a generalised boundary condition parametrised by two
matrices a and b for a-type and b-type boundary conditions respectively. it will be useful
to examine these matrices in the context of the linear sigma model.

appendix a: discrete symmetries and the 22 boundary states

in this appendix, we will discuss how the discrete symmetries of the 22 model enables
us to understand the resolution of the s-matrix and make connection with the choice of
boundary condition in the 22 lg model.

the character d is associated with the lg eld . we will thus use i to represent the
corresponding chiral primary in the i-th minimal model. thus the character b is associated
with 2. the part of the ishibashi state involving only the chiral primaries associated with
ddc will look something like

|2ii = (1

2  2

1)|0i +   

,

where there is a sign ambiguity in the denition if we require that it be an eigenstate of the
permutation group s2. both states will be associated with the same character ns2 = 2ddc.
the resolution of the s-matrix distinguishes between these two boundary states. under s2,
we have that |2ii  |2ii. the ishibashi state associated with ns0 remains invariant
under this s2. however, for the character associated with ns1, there are two possible
ishibashi states

|1ii = (2

1

2
2  2

2

2
1)|0i +   

,

25

where  denotes the s2 eigenvalue. requiring that s2 relate the boundary state |0i to either
|2i or |3i picks the minus sign. thus, we get under this s2 |0i  |3i and |1i  |2i.
there is another z2 subgroup of the discrete symmetry group generated by 1  i1
and 2  i2 (this corresponds to a = 1,b = 3 using the notation given in the examples
section for the 22 model.) one can check that under this z2, |2ii  |2ii. one can also
see that the states associated with ns0 and ns1 remain invariant under this z2. under the
action of this z2 one has |0i  |1i and |2i  |3i
in order to translate this picture into the lg language let us summarise the eect of the
two discrete groups on the lg elds. under the s2, 1  2 and under the z2, 1  i1
and 2  i2. we had discovered two dierent boundary conditions in the lg model
given by a = diag(1, i, 1) and a2 = diag(1, 1,1). under the s2  z2, a gives rise to four
dierent boundary conditions, while the a2 boundary condition is invariant under s2. thus
the gepner model construction seems to choose the boundary condition specied by a.
