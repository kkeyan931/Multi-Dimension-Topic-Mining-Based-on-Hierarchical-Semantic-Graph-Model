abstract

we write the brst operator of the n=1 superstring as q =

er( 1
this provides a trivial proof that q is nilpotent.

1 introduction

superstring theory in ten dimensions is a critical n = 1 superconformal
theory. it can be quantized using a nilpotent brst operator

q =

1

2i i dz [c(tm +

1
2

tg) + (gm +

1
2

gg)]

(1)

where [tm, gm] are the c = 15 n=1 superconformal generators and [tg, gg]
are the c = 15 n=1 superconformal generators constructed from a pair
of fermionic ghosts [b, c] and a pair of bosonic ghosts [, ]. physical states
are described by vertex operators in the cohomology of q and, in order to
construct vertex operators for the spacetime fermions, it is convenient to
fermionize the bosonic ghosts as

 = e
 = e,

(2)
(3)

where  and  are free fermions and  is a chiral boson.[1]

because the above fermionization involves  rather than , it is not
possible to write the zero mode of  in terms of the [, ] ghosts. the hilbert
space without the  zero mode is called the small hilbert space, while
the hilbert space including the  zero mode is called the large hilbert
space. the small hilbert space can be dened as operators annihilated by
h dz , and one can show that any such operator can be constructed out of
the original [, ] ghosts. since physical vertex operators should be in the
small hilbert space, they must be annihilated by both q and h dz . for
consistency, this requires that q should not only be nilpotent, but should
also anti-commute with h dz .
in this letter, we will construct a similarity transformation r such that
q = er( 1
2i h dz 2b)er. (note that the rst term of r was constructed in
[2].) since 2b is nilpotent, this trivially proves that q is nilpotent. fur-
thermore, since h dz 2b has trivial cohomology, it proves that q has trivial
cohomology in the large hilbert space.
however, r does not commute with h dz , so q has non-trivial cohomol-
ogy in the small hilbert space as expected. also, er( 1
2i h dz 2b)er only
anti-commutes with h dz  in the critical dimension, so one cannot use the
nilpotent er( 1

2i h dz 2b)er to quantize the superstring when d 6= 10.

2 similarity transformation

after fermionizing the [, ] ghosts as in (3) and bosonizing  = e and
 = e, the brst charge of (1) can be written as q = 1
2i h dz jbrst where

jbrst = c[tm  bc  2

we will now show that

j0 = be2(),

r =

(7)

note that jbrst was used in [3] as the fermionic generator g+ of a twisted
n=2 superconformal algebra. using (5), jbrst is trivially nilpotent since j0
has no poles with itself.

to prove (5), we use the expansion

erj0er =



xn=0

n!

jn,

jn = [jn1, r],

(8)

where, for r = 1

2i h dz r(z), the commutator is computed following the rule
(9)

[jn1(y), r] =

2i i dz jn1(y)r(z).

if d is the spacetime dimension of the superstring (i.e. gm(y)gm(z) 

d(y  z)3 + ...), the n = 1 term of (8) is given by

j1 = eegm + bcc

and the n = 4 term is given by

j4 =

e2e2cc2c.

(11)

(13)

the terms for n > 4 in the expansion vanish identically since the ope
between j4 and r has no single poles.

it is straightforward to check that jbrst of (4) is equal to

j0 + j1 +

when d = 10, so we have proven (5). note that when d 6= 10, the integral of
(14) contains the term (10  d)h dz( 1
16 e2()cc2c). since this
term does not anti-commute with h dz  = h dz e, the integral of (14) can
only be used as a brst charge when d = 10 for the reasons stated in the
introduction.
