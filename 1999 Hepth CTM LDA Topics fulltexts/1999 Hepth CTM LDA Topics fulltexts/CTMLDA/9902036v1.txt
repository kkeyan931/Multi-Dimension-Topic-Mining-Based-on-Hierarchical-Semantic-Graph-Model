abstract

in this thesis, i use the strong coupling expansion to investigate the multiavor lattice
schwinger models in the hamiltonian formalism using staggered fermions.
in particular,
i am interested in analysing the mapping of these gauge theories onto quantum spin-1/2
antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains. exploting this mapping, the chiral symmetry breaking
patterns are studied and the spectra are computed. the extrapolation to zero lattice spacing
of the results compare favorably qualitatively and quantitatively with the weak coupling
studies of the gauge models in the continuum.

i studied the one-avor lattice schwinger model, in the strong coupling limit, showing
that it is equivalent to an ising model with long-range coulomb interaction. even though the
continuous chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the staggered fermions, a discrete chiral
symmetry remains and appears in the lattice theory as a translation by one lattice site which
forbids fermion mass and must be broken in order for the lattice model to exhibit the features
of the spectrum of the continuum theory. the eects of the anomaly in the continuum
appear on the lattice through spontaneous symmetry breaking:
indeed i show that the
ground state spontaneously breaks translations by one lattice site. the dicrete symmetries
are carefully dened on the lattice. the masses of the low lying bosonic excitations as well
as the chiral condensate of the model are computed up to the fourth order in the strong
coupling expansion. very good agreement between lattice calculations and continuum values
is found.

the two-avor lattice schwinger model is analysed using the same computational scheme
adopted in the one-avor case. the problem of nding the low lying excitations is showed
to be equivalent to solving the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain.
in fact the
heisenberg hamiltonian is the eective hamiltonian of the gauge model at the second order
in the strong coupling expansion. the ground state of the spin model represents the vacuum
of the gauge theory in the strong coupling limit. two kinds of excitations can be created
from the ground state; one kind involves only spin ipping and has lower energy since
no electric ux is created, the other involves fermion transport besides spin ipping and
thus has higher energy. the massless excitations of the gauge model are the spinons of
the antiferromagnetic chain. the excitation masses can be expressed in terms of spin-spin
correlators evaluated on the ground state. either the massless or the massive excitations
have identical p - and g-parity to the low lying excitations of the continuum two avor gauge
model. good agreement between lattice and continuum results is found. the ground state
is translationally invariant: both the isoscalar or the isovector chiral condensates are zero
to every order in the strong coupling expansion as it happens in the continuum theory as
a consequence of the coleman theorem. in addition the vacuum expectation value of the
umklapp operator is non zero as it happens for the corresponding operator in the continuum
and this is the only relic of the chiral anomaly on the lattice.

the n -avor lattice schwinger models are analysed generalizing the n = 2 case and
at the second order in the strong coupling expansion are eectively described by spin-1/2
su (n ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains. the generalization is quite straightforward,
even if the theory is much dierent depending on if n is even or odd.

this thesis analyses the strong coupling limit of the multiavor lattice schwinger models and
their relationship with generalized quantum spin-1/2 su (n ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg
chains. my original contributions are summaryzed in chapters 4, 5 and 6. in chapter 4 the
issues of chiral symmetry breaking and the mass spectrum are studied for the one-avor
lattice schwinger model. part of this work appears in the pubblication

in chapter 5 the two-avor lattice schwinger model and its mapping onto the quantum
spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain are analysed in detail. at variance with the

gauge model is derived starting from the ground state of the heisenberg model. many of

introduction

quantum eld theory and condensed matter physics had an amazing development in this
century and each one borrowed from the other new ideas. for instance the concept of
spontaneous symmetry breaking was originally introduced to study ferromagnetism and the
higgs phenomenon appears studing the meissner eect in the theory of superconductivity [1].
mathematical analogies between the two disciplines were pointed out by wilson [2] who
joined the concepts of renormalization, typical of particle physics, with the concepts of
universality and scaling, originally introduced to describe second order phase transitions.
later wilson [3] introduced a lattice formulation of gauge theories. once an euclidean eld
theory is dened on the lattice it becomes a statistical mechanics problem. in general a
quantum theory in d dimensions is equivalent to a classical statistical mechanical system
in d + 1 dimensions. the phase diagram of a statistical system determines its physical
properties. landau introduced the general description of all phase transitions as changes of
symmetry [4]. fluctuations grow in a substance as its critical point is approached and they
interact very strongly with each other so that the system is strongly correlated. the order
of a phase transition is crucial: only if the phase transition is continuous, it is possible to
obtain from a lattice eld theory a relativistic continuous theory. the lattice approach to
gauge theories provides a powerful tool to study non-perturbative properties.

one of the most important properties of non-abelian gauge theories, such as quantum
chromodynamics (qcd), is asymptotic freedom [5]. at short distances or high momenta
quarks are weakly interacting and it is possible to perform a perturbative expansion. at large
distances or small momenta the coupling constant increases indenitely conning quarks.
connement is an observed property of the strong interactions and it is an unproven, but
widely believed feature of most non-abelian gauge theories in four and lower space-time
dimensions. the theoretical mechanism behind connement is dicult to analyze since it
escapes the weak coupling analysis: it is intrinsecally a strong coupling and non-perturbative
phenomenon.

wilson [3] proposed on the lattice a mechanism for quark connement. gauge theories
have been analysed in the strong coupling limit on a (3+1)-dimensional space-time lattice. in
the weak coupling limit the gauge eld behaves like a normal free massless eld and quarks
are unbound. in the strong coupling limit the gauge eld is massive and the quarks are
bound. there should be a connement-deconnement phase transition at some intermediate
value of the coupling constant.

in the continuum, closely related to connement there is dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking, which creates the  mesons and keep their masses light. chiral symmetry [6]
is only an approximate symmetry of particle physics since the up and down quarks are

1

light but not massless. otherwise the pion, which is the goldstone boson arising from the
symmetry breaking would be strictly massless rather than being just light. the theory
behind chiral symmetry breaking is only partially understood because this phenomenon
occurs at strong coupling where the standard tools of perturbation theory are not reliable.
there are conjectures [7] that if one could adjust the charge of the electron e in ordinary
qed, there would be a critical value of e at which a phase transition would take place and
the electron would become very massive. a transition to heavy electrons would break the
approximate chiral symmetry of qed which is there because electrons are very light.

the strong coupling limit [8] of lattice gauge theories though far from the scaling regime
is often used to study the qualitative properties of a gauge model. two important fea-
tures of the spectrum of non-abelian gauge theories appear there. the strong coupling limit
exhibits connement [3], which is related in a rather natural way to the gauge symmetry
and compactness of the non-abelian gauge group. moreover, it is straightforward to show
that strongly coupled gauge theories exhibit dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. wilson
fermions [9] explicitly break chiral symmetry but for what concerns staggered fermions [10],
even if the continuous chiral symmetry is broken explicitly, a discrete axial symmetry sur-
vives the lattice regularization and appears in the lattice theory as a translation by one
spacing. several quantitative investigations of gauge theories using strong coupling tech-
niques have been performed and there have been attempts to compute the mass spectrum
of realistic models such as qcd [11]. the strong coupling expansion is an expansion in the
inverse of the gauge coupling constant. due to asymptotic freedom, the continuum limit
is found where the coupling constant is small, so that one should not expect a priori that
the strong coupling expansion gives accurate quantitative information about the continuum
gauge theory. however, the expansion does have a nite radius of convergence [12]; this indi-
cates that its properties are shared by the model for a nite range of the coupling parameter
and certain informations can be obtained by analytic continuation to regions outside the
convergence radius.

it has been recognised for some time that the strong coupling limit of lattice gauge the-
ories with dynamical fermions is related to certain quantum spin systems. the relationship
between gauge and spin systems is particularly evident in the hamiltonian formalism [13] and
already appeared in some of the earliest analysis of chiral symmetry breaking in the strong
coupling limit [14]. in particular mesons emerge as spin waves when spontaneous chiral sym-
metry breaking takes place. it was noticed that there are several formal similarities between
some condensed matter systems with lattice fermions  and in particular certain antiferro-
magnetic spin systems  and lattice gauge theories in their strong coupling limit [15]. the
quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet was recognised to be equivalent to the strong
coupling limit of a u (1) lattice gauge theory [16] and can also be written as a kind of su (2)
gauge theory [17]. furthermore, staggered fermions resemble ordinary lattice fermions used
in tight binding models in condensed matter physics at half-lling, i.e. when there is one
electron per site, and placed in a background u (1) magnetic eld  (mod 2)  1/2 of a
ux quantum  through every plaquette of the lattice. in (2 + 1)-dimensions the parallel
between lattice fermions in condensed matter and gauge theories was already recognized in
the rst work [21] on the azbel-wannier-hofstaeder problem and then has been discussed
in the context of the so called ux phases of the hubbard model. it is actually true for all
d  2 + 1 [22], i.e. the staggered lattice fermion approximation of the relativistic dirac eld
with the minimal number of avors is identical to a condensed matter fermion problem with
simple nearest neighbor hopping in a background magnetic eld which has 1/2 ux quantum
per plaquette. in the condensed matter context, the magnetic ux can be produced by a
condensate, as in the ux phases of the heisenberg and hubbard models [15]. a 1/2 ux
quantum per plaquette for ordinary lattice spacing is yet an experimentally inaccessible ux
density. nonetheless it could be achieved in analog experiments where macroscopic arrays
of josephson junctions, for example, take the place of atoms at lattice sites and their ground
state in two dimensions is expected to be a ux phase [23].

2

the analogy between dirac and tight-binding condensed matter fermions was exploited
to nd an exact mapping of the strong coupling limit of a large class of lattice gauge theories
with dynamical staggered fermions onto certain quantum antiferromagnets, both the con-
ventional heisenberg antiferromagnets with spin s and generalized antiferromagnets with
spins taking values in lie algebras other than su (2) [24]. the precise structure of the
resulting antiferromagnet depends on the number of colours in the gauge group  since
s = nc/2  and also on the number of fermion avors. there are four dierent cases. (a)
an u (nc) gauge theory with an even number n of lattice avors of staggered fermions is an
su (n ) antiferromagnet in the strong coupling limit. the number of colours nc determines
the representation of the antiferromagnet as being the one represented by the young tableau
with nc columns and n /2 rows. (b) an su (nc) gauge theory with nc  3 is an u (n )
antiferromagnet. the representation of the u (1) subgroup of u (n ) is not constrained as it
was in the (a) case where the local u (1) charge had to vanish. the representation of the
su (n ) subgroup of u (n ) can now take on any representation on a given site, subject only
to the constraint that the average fermion density is ncn /2 and the number of fermions on
each site is given by the number of boxes in the corresponding young tableau. (c) the su (2)
lattice gauge theories are special. in the strong coupling limit additional terms compared
to su (nc  3) appear and one obtains for n lattice avors antiferromagnets associated
with the simplectic group sp(2n ) and for n = 1 a spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet.
(d) a gauge theory with an odd number n of lattice avors of staggered fermions in the
strong coupling limit is an su (n ) antiferromagnet where the size of representations on
neighboring sites dier. one has to divide the sites in two sublattices such that the nearest
neighbors of all the sites of one sublattice are in the other sublattice; if this classication in
two sublattices is possible, the lattice is called bipartite. on the bipartite lattice one has the
representation of su (n ) with young tableau with (n + 1)/2 rows and nc columns on one
sublattice and with (n  1)/2 rows and nc columns on the other sublattice. there exist
analogs in spin systems of strong interactions behavior, particularly for what concerns con-
nement and chiral symmetry. laughlin [25] recently provided an appealing interpretation
of connement in quantum antiferromagnets. the physical idea is that the phase diagram of
antiferromagnets consists of competing ordered phases regulated by a nearby quantum crit-
ical point. exactly at the critical point the low lying elementary excitations of the magnet
are gauge elds and particles with fractional quantum numbers analogous to the spinon and
holon excitations found in spin chains. away from the critical point, even if very close, the
fundamental constituents bind at low energy scales to make the familiar collective modes
of ordered states which one renormalizes. the existence of fundamental constituents in
conventional materials and models may be indirectly inferred by high-energy spectroscopy
and inconsistences in sum rules exactly the way the existence of quarks is inferred in par-
ticle physics. there exist physically identiable objects behaving like u (1) quarks out of
which the elementary excitations are built. in laughlins scenario quark-like objects and
gauge elds would be liberated at the critical point and would become the true elementary
excitations.

in quantum antiferromagnets, the appearence of neel order is the analog of chiral sym-
metry breaking. exploiting the mapping existing between gauge and spin models, rigorous
results about antiferromagnets can be used to prove spontaneous broken chiral symmetry in
certain strong coupling gauge theories. whenever the ground state of the antiferromagnet
is not translationally invariant, the discrete chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. the
possibility of studing in detail the patterns of chiral symmetry breaking on the lattice is
very important. in particular, an interesting question is how the axial anomaly [26] appears
in the lattice regularization. anomalies occur when all of the symmetries of a classical
eld theory cannot be realized simultaneously in the corresponding quantum eld theory.
the classical example is the adler-bell-jackiw anomaly in a vector like gauge theory where
gauge invariance and global axial symmetry are incompatible. this is a manifestation of
the fact that it is impossible to nd a regularization of ultraviolet divergences preserving
both axial and gauge invariance. if gauge invariance is preserved, the observable manifesta-
tion of the anomaly is the failure of the conservation laws for axial vector currents and the

3

resulting abscence of their consequences in the spectrum of the quantized theory. nielsen
and ninomiya [27] proved that fermion theories on a lattice have an equal number of species
of left- and right-handed weyl particles in the continuum limit, thus preventing an axial
anomaly. lattice eld theories are manifestly gauge invariant by construction and therefore,
to produce continuum theories, they must nd a way to violate axial current conservation.

in the continuum an interesting mechanism of connement in quantum electrodynamics
(qed) with massless fermions in (1 + 1)-dimensions was discovered by schwinger [28] which
demonstrated that the photon acquires a mass and the spectrum of the model does not
exhibit any free electron asymptotycal state. the photon mass is proportional to the
electromagnetic coupling constant if charges are totally screened by the vacuum polarization.
after this investigation qed in (1 + 1)-dimensions with massless fermions has been called
the schwinger model. moreover schwinger speculated that in four dimensions the photon
mass would be zero for any electromagnetic charge e less than ec; for e greater than ec the
photon mass would be non-zero and vary with e. at the critical coupling constant ec a
change of phase from zero to non-zero photon mass should take place.

in this thesis it is my purpose to investigate the one-avor and the multiavor lattice
schwinger models in the hamiltonian formalism using staggered fermions. exploiting these
toy models i will clarify the mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking on the lattice and the
vestiges of the chiral anomaly of the continuum theory. moreover the spectra of these models
will be computed in the strong coupling limit. extrapolating the spectra to the zero lattice
spacing limit by means of pade approximants [29], i nd that the lattice compare favorably
 both qualitatively and quantitatively  with the weak coupling continuum studies of the
multiavor schwinger models. the success of the procedure is not completely surprising
since the continuum theory of free massive mesons can be described in terms of quarks and
antiquarks pairs bound by gauge strings and it is precisely this idea which is embodied in
lattice methods. the n -avor lattice schwinger models in the strong coupling limit are
eectively described by generalized quantum su (n ) spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic
hamiltonians. spinons are the fundamental spin-1/2 excitations of quantum antiferromag-
nets. in the same way as the schwinger models spectra do not exhibit free quarks (electrons)
but just massive bosons, the photons or better mesons, also the heisenberg models exci-
tations contain an even number of spinons and so carry integer spin. one original result of
my work has been to show explicitly how spinons appear in lattice gauge theories.

in chapter 2 i shall review the lattice approach to gauge theories. in particular boson,
fermion and gauge elds are dened on the lattice. the fermion doubling problem is
analysed and wilson and staggered fermions are introduced. the hamiltonian formulation
of gauge theories and the strong coupling limit are described. furthermore the realization of
the chiral anomaly on the lattice is discussed and the nielsen and ninomiya no-go theorem
is demonstrated.

chapter 3 is devoted to a detailed analysis of quantum antiferromagnetic spin chains
with special emphasis to the topics useful to understand the connection between schwinger
and heisenberg models. first i demonstrate that spin wave theory fails in one dimension
due to strong infrared divergences. then i introduce the haldane-shastry model where it is
particularly easy to see the spinons and analyse the spectrum. the bethe ansatz solution of
the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian is then reviewed in detail. i study
the complete spectrum of nite size heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains of 4 and 6 sites
and i verify that the thermodynamic limit solution provided in [30] is already very well
reproduced in the nite size chains. moreover, i write down explicitly the ground state of 4,
6 and 8 sites chains. spin-spin correlators relevant for evaluating the mass spectrum of the
two-avor lattice schwinger model are calculated. in the last section, generalized heisenberg
antiferromagnets with symmetry group su (n ) are introduced.

in chapter 4 the one-avor lattice schwinger model is studied. the discrete chiral sym-

4

metry on the lattice is broken explicitly and this mechanism reproduces the eects that in
the continuum are generated by the axial anomaly. the discrete symmetries of the model
are analysed in detail and the vacuum of the model is found to be the ground state of the
antiferromagnetic ising spin chain with long range coulomb interaction. the spectrum of
the continuum theory is very well reproduced when the lattice results are extrapolated using
the pade approximants.

in chapter 5 i analyse the two-avor lattice schwinger model. in the strong coupling
limit the gauge model is eectively described by the quantum spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic
heisenberg model. the vacuum of the gauge theory in the strong coupling limit is the ground
state of the spin model: a quantum disordered state very dierent from the classical neel
state. it is not possible to write down explicitly this ground state in the thermodynamic
limit, but its energy can be computed using the bethe ansatz as explained in chapter 3. the
massless excitations of the gauge model are the spinons of the heisenberg antiferromagnet,
while the massive excitations are created by acting on the ground state with pertinent
operators that have the right quantum numbers of the continuum theory and generate
charge transport. the excitation masses of the gauge model are completely expressed in
terms of vacuum expectation values (vevs) of spin-spin correlation functions. the chiral
symmetry breaking pattern is explicit in this case, due to the staggered fermions coupled
by the gauge eld. the isoscalar and isovector chiral condensates, that in the continuum
are zero due to the coleman theorem, are zero also on the lattice. the vacuum expectation
value of the umklapp operator is non-zero due to the explicit breaking of ua(1); this can be
viewed as a manifestation of the anomaly on the lattice.

in chapter 6 the analysis of chapter 5 is generalized to the schwinger models with su (n )
avor group. in the strong coupling limit the gauge models are equivalent to generalized
su (n ) quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets. even if most of the analysis is a straightfor-
ward generalization of the n = 2 case, some surprising dierence arises between the n even
and odd models. some concluding remarks and a short summary of results is provided.

the appendix aims at elucidating some features of pade approximants relevant for a

better understanding of chapters 4 and 5.

lattice gauge theories

it is my purpose to review in this chapter the lattice approach to gauge theories. i do not
pretend to be exhaustive, but i want to illustrate the topics used in my approach to the
lattice schwinger model. the reader interested in knowing more about lattice gauge theories
could usefully look up refs.[8, 31].

quantum eld theory is so far the most appropriate scheme for describing the strong,
electromagnetic and weak interactions between elementary particles. it has been known for
long time that electromagnetic interactions are described by a quantum gauge eld theory,
but the fundamental role played by the principle of gauge invariance in the construction of
a theory for the strong and weak interactions has been recognized only much later.

qcd, the theory of strong interactions, is a gauge theory based on the unbroken non-
abelian su (3) group. the group su (3) has eight generators and so there are eight mass-
less gluons carrying a colour charge which mediate the strong interactions between the
fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks. qcd is an asymptotically free theory [5].
asymptotic freedom allowed to carry out quantitative perturbative calculations of observ-
ables which are sensitive to the short distance structure of qcd. quarks have never been
seen free in nature and only colour neutral baryons are observed: quarks are conned.
a demonstration that qcd accounts for quarks connement can only come from a non-
perturbative treatment of the theory; connement is indeed a consequence of the dynamics
at large distances where perturbation theory breaks down.

wilson [3] showed 1 that in the strong coupling limit qcd connes quarks, however
this is not a justied approximation when studying the continuum limit. there are nu-
merical simulations which strongly suggest that qcd accounts for quark connement [31].
moreover, there are other fascinating questions that one would like to answer: does qcd
account for the observed spectrum? are there other particles allowed by qcd but not yet
experimentally observed? does qcd account for chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking?
in order to answer the above questions it is necessary a non perturbative treatment of qcd
which at the moment is only provided by the lattice formulation.

the lattice formulation of qcd by wilson opened the way to the study of non-perturbative

phenomena using numerical methods. his purpose was to study the long distance properties
of qcd in a format where the short distance properties which lead to ultraviolet divergences
are regulated by the lattice cuto. the space-time discretization provides a natural cut-o

1independently, gauge theories were discussed on a lattice by wegner [32], who elevated the global up 
down symmetry of the ordinary ising to a local symmetry and in an unpublished work, which deals mostly
with abelian gauge theories, by polyakov in 1974.

scheme as wave-lengths shorter than twice the lattice spacing, a, have no meaning and the
momentum domain is restricted to a region bounded by /a. the lattice provides then a
non-perturbative regularization of ultraviolet divergences. once a lattice eld theory has
been formulated, the original eld theory problem becomes one of statistical mechanics.
with a nite lattice there are a nite number of variables.
it is then possible to study
various physical interesting quantities: energy spectrum, correlation functions, critical ex-
ponents etc., for example by computer simulations based on the monte carlo method [31].
by now lattice gauge theories have become a branch of particle physics in its own right, and
their intimate connection to statistical mechanics raised the interest of elementary particle
phisicists as well as of condensed matter physicists.

since the beginning of lattice gauge theory, chiral symmetries have been perplexing. the
issues revolve around anomalies and fermion doubling. for vector-like theories such as qcd
the problems are largely resolved. the wilson approach [9] breaks chiral symmetry explicitly
by adding a symmetry breaking term to give all the doublers a mass which becomes innite
with the cut-o scale. the kogut and susskind fermions [10], also called staggered fermions,
eliminate the doubling by reducing the brillouin zone, i.e., by doubling the eective lattice
spacing. the situation is much more clouded for the full standard model. here chiral
symmetry plays a fundamental role, with neutrinos maximally violating parity. nielsen and
ninomiya demonstrated a no-go theorem [27] whose most important consequence is that the
weak interaction cannot be put on the lattice. for a general class of fermion theories on a
lattice in the hamiltonian formalism an equal number of species of left- and right-handed
weyl particles, i.e. neutrinos, necessary appears in the continuum limit. they also proved
that this disease is not peculiar to the lattice theory, but some trouble appears universally
in all regularization schemes, for instance dimensional regularization. in any lattice theory
of chirally invariant fermions with locality there is an equal number of production and
annihilation of weyl fermions. thus there is no net production, so that the axial charges
are conserved. an analogy or a simulation exists between the weyl fermion theory and
gapless semiconductors, where two energy bands have point-like degeneracies. in section
(2.4) i shall discuss thoroughly this no-go theorem. at the moment no reliable lattice
computation for the standard model does exist.

in section (2.1) i discuss the dierences arising between boson and fermion elds on the
lattice and i analyse the fermion doubling, an obstacle to put fermions on a lattice. gauge
elds on the lattice are discussed.

section (2.2) is devoted to introduce staggered fermions, a particular type of lattice
fermions which partially avoid the fermion doubling problem. moreover, hamiltonian for-
mulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced.

section (2.3) explains the strong coupling approach to lattice gauge theories in the hamil-

tonian formalism.

in section (2.4) the nielsen and ninomiya no-go theorem is reviewed and the chiral
symmetry and chiral anomaly on the lattice are analysed and the implications and analogs
of these topics in condensed matter theory are discussed.

2.1 bosons and fermions on the lattice

any eld (scalar, fermionic or gauge) can be dened on a lattice, but the result of putting
a bosonic or a fermionic eld on a lattice is distinctly dierent. while the procedure for a
bosonic eld is straightforward, placing the dirac equation on a space-time lattice presents
some surprisingly dicult problem.

7

in this section i shall rst illustrate the way to put the scalar eld on the lattice. then i
shall discuss the so called doubling problem [8] of lattice fermions. a prescription to cure it
is discussed, the wilson fermions [9], while section (2.2) is devoted to discuss the kogut and
susskind fermions or staggered fermions [10], which have been used in my approach to the
lattice schwinger model. the link variable nature of gauge elds on the lattice is explained.

2.1.1 bose elds on the lattice: scalar elds

let us study how a scalar eld (x) can be dened on a lattice. consider the continuum
eld theory in euclidean space

where

s() =z ddx(cid:20) 1

(2.2)

a matter eld is attributed to the lattice sites and it is natural to approximate a continuous
eld by its values at the lattice sites

(x)  x

(2.3)

clearly, in order for the lattice eld x to be a good approximation of a continuous eld
conguration (x), the lattice spacing should be much smaller than the characteristic size
of this conguration. the derivative can be replaced by

 

1
a

(x+  x)

(2.4)

where  is a d-vector of length a in the direction of . the d dimensional integration is
replaced by a sum

so that the scalar action on the lattice becomes

it is instructive to go to momentum space to see the spectrum of the free eld theory. for
this i take the fourier transform

continuum theory, the dotted line for the latticized system.

rather than the standard m2 + k2. nevertheless these two expressions have the same con-
tinuum limit as they coincide at the minimum value of k = 0 (see g. (2.1)).

the lattice action eq.(2.6) is quantized by using the feynman path-integral formalism,

in which the expectation value of a product of elds is given by

the meaning of the integrals should be clear as one recalls that the usual functional integrals
are actually dened on a discretized space-time lattice and an appropriate continuum limit
is taken at the end. if one rescales the eld as

the lattice action scales as

i.e. the coupling constant  has become an overall factor in the action. in this way eqs.(2.11)

2.1.2 fermi elds on the lattice

i shall now introduce the procedure to put fermi elds on the lattice. a new phenomenon,
the fermion doubling [8, 31] appears discretizing the dirac equation, i.e. additional fermionic
species are generated. let us illustrate the fermion doubling problem starting from an exam-
ple on a spatial lattice and continuum time in 1+1 dimensions. the massless dirac equation
in 1+1 dimensions in the continuum reads

i  = ix = i5x

with  =(cid:18) 1

with

the dispersion relation is

(x, t) = ei(kxet)

let us consider the naively latticized dirac equation. i place the spinor  =(cid:18) 1

and for ka =   ka, with ka  1,

.

(2.24)

(2.25)

there are two two-component dirac particles in the continuum limit, and the total chiral
charge of the fermions is zero. consider, for example, the excitations associated with the
eld + on the lattice. there are right-movers (k  0) and left-movers (k  ), and since
chirality (helicity for particles) is just velocity in 1 + 1 dimensions this lattice eld describes
a pair of fermions with net chirality zero.

the same phenomenon happens in 3+1 dimensions, even if it is more dicult to visualize

it. the dirac hamiltonian for massive fermions now reads

with

h = il

+ m

l = 5l

,

 = 0

.

(2.26)

(2.27)

the eld operator describing the multifermion system will be denoted by (~x) where
 = 0, 1, 2, 3 is the dirac index and the three-component vector ~x denotes a space point.
the hamiltonian of the free fermion eld is obtained from the single particle hamiltonian
eq.(2.26) as

h =z d3x(~x)h(~x)

11

(2.28)

let us now introduce a regular cubic lattice in space with lattice spacing a and elementary
cubes of volume a3. on a nite lattice with total volume v = (al)3 the lattice points have
integer indices ~x = {xl
l = 1, 2, 3} satisfying 0  xl  l  1. the continuous eld will
be replaced by a discrete variable associated with elementary cubes, and the volume integral
becomes a nite sum

;

(x)  ~x

,

z d3x xx

.

the discrete eld variables are assumed to satisfy the anticommutation relations

{~x, ~y} =n~x, ~yo = 0

, n~x, ~yo =

and the continuous derivatives are discretized as

where ~l denotes a unit vector on the lattice in direction ~l. applying these rules in the
hamiltonian eq.(2.29) one obtains the naive discretized form

(2.33)

the free eld hamiltonian describes a collection of harmonic fermionic oscillators in mo-
mentum space. assuming periodic boundary conditions in all three orthogonal directions of
the l3 cube, the allowed momentum components are discrete points in the brillouin zone,
namely

~p (cid:26)pl =

2
l

nl

;

l = 1, 2, 3(cid:27) ,

0  nl  l  1 .

(2.34)

due to periodicity, instead of 0  pl < 2, the brillouin zone can also be equivalently dened
in the interval  < pl  . fourier transformed eld components read

in momentum space the hamiltonian (2.33) reads

the matrix in curly brackets in eq.(2.37) has eigenvalues

eq.(2.38) gives the possible energies of the free naive lattice fermions. in the continuum
limit a  0, eq.(2.38) approaches the usual dispersion relation for free fermions, since the
coordinate vector is a~x and correspondingly, the momentum vector is ~k = 1
a ~p. for xed
momentum ~k and a  0 one has

e2

~p = m2 + ~k2 + o(a2)

.

(2.39)

12

this is as expected, but still the naive lattice hamiltonian eq.(2.33) is not entirely satisfac-
tory. due to the fact that sin(p + ) =  sin p one has

e2

~p = e2

~p+~

where ~ is one of the eight vectors

~ = { (0, 0, 0), (, 0, 0), (0, , 0), (0, 0, )
(, , 0), (, 0, ), (0, , ), (, , )

,

} .

(2.40)

(2.41)

these are the eight corners of the part of the brillouin zone satisfying 0  pl   (l = 1, 2, 3).
the consequence of eq.(2.40) is that in this naive lattice formulation there are eight fermion
states per eld component. this phenomena is called fermion doubling although a more
appropriate name would be fermion octupling. the basic reason for fermion doubling is
that the dirac equation is of rst order. in the case of free fermions one could, perhaps,
tolerate this unwanted proliferation of degrees of freedom, but in an interacting theory the
extra fermions inuence the physical content in a non-trivial way, because the additional
states can be pair-produced through the interactions of the fermion eld. for example, even
if the external particles in a process are the states at the zero (0, 0, 0) corner of the brillouin
zone, the states of the other zones appear in virtual loops.

in the continuum limit a  0 the mass m is replaced by m + 2r
a n, where n is the number
of momentum components equal to . therefore, the states with n 6= 0 become innitely
heavy. the only physical fermion state with nite energy is at the zero corner of the brillouin
zone. in section (2.2) i shall provide a detailed description of a dierent method to cure
the doubling disease, i.e. the staggered fermions which are the closest possible analog to the
lattice fermions in condensed matter physics.

2.1.3 gauge elds on the lattice

let us now discuss how to put gauge elds on the lattice and briey review how one arrives at
the gauge invariant action in the continuum with the simple example of qed. the starting

13

point is the action of the free dirac eld

sf =z d4x(x)(i  m)(x)

.

the action is invariant under the transformation

(x)  ei(x)
(x)  (x)ei
with  independent of x (i.e. a global transformation).

(2.45)

(2.46)

(2.47)

the next step is to require to the action to be also invariant under local u (1) trans-
formations with  () transforming independently at dierent space-time points. this is
accomplished by introducing a four-vector potential a(x) and replacing the ordinary four
derivative  by the covariant derivative d dened by
.

(2.48)

d =  + iea

the resulting new action

sf =z d4x(x)(id  m)(x)

is then invariant under the local transformations
(x)  ei(x)(x)
(x)  (x)ei(x)
a(x)  ei(x)(a(x) 

i
e

)ei(x)

.

(2.49)

(2.50)
(2.51)

(2.52)

the crucial property which ensures the gauge invariance of eq.(2.49) is that, while a
transforms inhomogeneously, the transformation law for the covariant derivative eq.(2.48)
is homogeneous

d  ei(x)dei(x)

.

(2.53)

by introducing a four-vector eld a gauge invariance of the action (2.49) is ensured; one
now must introduce a kinetic term which allows a to propagate

f is the gauge invariant eld strenght tensor

sg = 

1

4z d4xf f 

f = a  a

.

(2.54)

(2.55)

the gauge invariant action describing the dynamics of the fermionic and gauge eld is

sqed = sf + sg .

(2.56)

let us start our approach to lattice qed by considering the lattice action of a free
dirac eld. to parallel as closely as possible the steps in the continuum formulation, i shall
consider wilson fermions where every lattice site is occupied by all dirac components .
the results presented in the following are valid also for staggered fermions. the hamiltonian
eq.(2.42) is invariant under the global transformations
x  eix
x  xei

(2.57)

(2.58)

where ei is an element of the u (1) group. the next step is in requiring the theory to
be invariant under local u (1) transformations, with the group element eix depending on

14

the lattice site. because of the non diagonal structure of the second and third term in the
hamiltonian eq.(2.42) (whose origin is the derivative in the continuum formulation) one is
forced to introduce new degrees of freedom. since the group elements eix do not act on the
dirac indices, it is sucient for the following argument to focus our attention on a typical
bilinear term

~x~x+~l

.

(2.59)

in the continuum it is well known how such bilinear terms should be modied in order to
arrive at a gauge invariant expression. since the bilinear (~x)(~y) transforms under gauge
transformations

(~x)(~y)  (~x)ei(~x)ei(~y)(~y)

(2.60)

one must include a factor depending on the gauge potential which compensates the eq.(2.60)
gauge variation. this factor, called schwinger line integral is given by

u (~x, ~y) = eier ~y

~x dza(~z)

(2.61)

and the line integral is carried out along a path connecting the point ~x with the point ~y.
u (~x, ~y) is an element of the u (1) group. under a gauge transformation eq.(2.52), eq.(2.61)
transforms as

u (~x, ~y)  ei(~x)u (~x, ~y)ei(~y)

.

(2.62)

from these considerations, one concludes that the following bilinear expression in the fermion
elds  and  is gauge invariant

(~x)u (~x, ~y)(~y) = (~x)eier ~y

~x dza(~z)(y)

.

(2.63)

let us suppose now that ~y = ~x + ~. from eq.(2.63) one concludes that the bilinears should
be dened as

(~x)(~x + ~)  (~x)u (~x, ~x + ~)(~x + ~)
(~x + ~)(~x)  (~x + ~)u(~x, ~x + ~)(~x)

with

u (~x, ~x + ~) = eie ~ ~a(~x)

(2.64)
(2.65)

(2.66)

and ~  ~a =p a.

to arrive at a gauge-invariant expression for the fermionic action on the lattice, one

should make the following substitution in eq.(2.42)

~x+~l(0l + ir)~x  ~x+~l(0l + ir)u~x+~l,~x~x
~x(0l  ir)~x+~l  ~x(0l  ir)u~x,~x+~l~x+~l

where

figure 2.4: link variables.

at variance with the matter elds discussed before, the group element u~x,~x+~l lives on the
links connecting two neighbouring lattice sites; hence i shall refer to them as link vari-
ables. the link variables have a direction and one can introduce a graphical representation
- g.(2.4).

the hamiltonian eq.(2.42) with the wilson fermions can be written in the following

gauge invariant form

(2.75)

by requiring that u~x,~x+~l and u~x+~l,~x transform according to eqs.(2.73,2.74), one naturally
implements u (1)-gauge invariance in the hamiltonian and, a posteriori, one can state that
the link variables are elements of the u (1) gauge group due to the requirement that their
gauge transforms must also be elements of u (1).

taking the continuum limit a  0 of eq.(2.75) one should get the usual continuum
hamiltonian eq.(2.29). this requirement is fullled by establishing a relation between the
link variables and the vector potential a(~x). the vector potential a(~x) at the lattice site
~x is real valued and carries a lorentz index. the same happens for 
~x which parametrizes
the link variable u~x,~x+~. the dierence is that 
~x takes only values in the interval [0, 2],
while the values taken by the vector potential a(~x) in the continuum theory extends over
the entire real line.

since a carries the dimension of an inverse length, while  is dimensionless one may

try the ansatz

(~x) = caa(~x)

(2.76)

where a is the lattice spacing and c is a constant to be determined. in the continuum limit
a  0 the range of a will be innite.

by scaling m, and  as m  am,   a

small values of a with

eq.(2.75) reduces to the continuum eq.(2.49) if one sets c = e. from here on i use the
notation

u~x,~x+~  1 + icaa(~x)

.

(2.77)

(2.78)
with this identication it is now an easy matter to verify that for a  0 u(~x) transforms
as follows under gauge transformations

u(~x) = u~x,~x+~ = eieaa(~x)

.

u(~x)  ei~xu(~x)ei~x+~ = eieaag

to complete the construction of lattice qed one has to construct the lattice version of
the kinetic term eq.(2.54) for gauge elds which should be strictly gauge invariant and a
functional of link variables only. such gauge-invariant functionals are easily constructed by
taking the product of link variables around closed loops on the euclidean space-time lattice.
moreover, because of the local structure of the integrand in eq.(2.54) one should focus his
attention on the smallest possible loops on the euclidean space time lattice. hence one is
led to consider the product of link variables around an elementary plaquette as shown in
g.(2.5). one then denes

2.2 staggered fermions

in what follows i shall introduce the staggered fermion formalism [10] that i used to study
the lattice schwinger models. in this formalism one eliminates the unwanted fermion modes
by reducing the brillouin zone, i.e. by doubling the eective lattice spacing. in the case of
a d-dimensional lattice, one subdivides it into elementary d-dimensional hypercubes of unit
length. at each site within a given hypercube one places a dierent degree of freedom and
repeats this structure periodically throughout the lattice. since there are 2d sites within a
hypercube, but only 2
2 dierent dirac elds to
reduce the brillouin zone by a factor of 1
2 .

2 components of a dirac eld, one needs 2

d

d

in the continuum, the massless dirac spinors are invariant under the chiral rotations

(x)  ei5(x)

, (x)  (x)ei5

(2.85)

the continuum axial symmetry (2.85) is broken explicitly by the staggered fermions, but a
discrete axial symmetry remains. it is a chiral rotation of  = /2 and corresponds to the
continuum transformation

(x)  5(x)

, (x)  (x)5

(2.86)

and appears on the lattice as a translation by one site.

let us start to see how staggered fermions work in (1 + 1)-dimensions. the main idea is
to reduce the number of degrees of freedom by using a single component fermi eld x on
each site of the lattice

(2.87)

(2.88)

(2.89)

{x, y} = 0 ,
so that the lattice dirac hamiltonian reads

{x, y} = xy

hd = 

it

2axx

(x+1x  xx+1)

and the equations of motion are

x = i[hd, x] =

t
2a

[x+1  x1]

.

if one decomposes the lattice into even and odd sublattices (characterized by x even and
odd), one can identify a single two component dirac spinor by associating the upper com-
ponent with even sites and the lower component with odd sites (or vice versa). in this way
the equations of motion become

1(x) =

1
2a

[2(x + 1)  2(x  1)]

2(x) =

1
2a

[1(x + 1)  1(x  1)] .

(2.90)

(2.91)

comparing eq.(2.90) and eq.(2.91) with the the continuum dirac equation, one immediately
sees that the staggered fermion formalism avoids the species doubling problem by doubling
the lattice spacing and so halving the size of the brillouin zone.

let us now discuss the symmetries of the lattice dirac hamiltonian eq.(2.88).

it is
invariant under translations of the spatial lattice by an even number of sites. translation
by two lattice spacings is the ordinary continuum translation, whose generator is

p = iz dxx = iz dx(1x1 + 2x2)

(2.92)

18

and it does not mix upper and lower spinor components. consequently, one expects the
lattice generator not to mix the two sublattices

(x+2x + xx+2)

p = ixx

.

(2.93)

the hamiltonian eq.(2.88) is also invariant under translations by an odd number of

sites. the lattice generator of this symmetry is

(xx+1 + x+1x)

q5 =xx

(2.94)

which in the continuum would be q5 = r dx5. the matrix 5 applied to the bispinor

interchanges upper and lower component, this on the lattice corresponds to translation by
one lattice site.

i illustrate now staggered fermions on a (d  1)-dimensional hypercubic lattice and con-
tinuum time ( hamiltonian formalism) which are obtained by spin-diagonalization [33] of
the naively latticized dirac hamiltonian

hf = 

i

2x~x,j (cid:16)(~x + ~j)j

  (~x)  (~x)j

  (~x + ~j)(cid:17)

(2.95)

where (x) are the fermion eld operators,  = 1, 2, . . . 2[d/2] is the spin index, ~x 
(x1, x2 . . . x(d1)) = pd1
j=1 xj~j (the xj are integers) refers to lattice sites, j are unit vec-
tors and j are the 2[d/2]  2[d/2] hermitean dirac matrices - here [d/2] is the largest integer
less than or equal to d/2. hamiltonian (2.95) describes a fermion hopping problem in a
u(2[d/2]) background gauge eld given by the unitary2 matrices j . the crucial observation
which allows spin diagonalization is that this background eld has only u(1) curvature, i.e.
if one considers the product around any plaquette

jk(j )(k) = 1 .

(2.96)

hence the only information carried by the -matrices which is invariant under a space
dependent change of phase of the fermion elds is that a product of s around any plaquette
is 1. this allows diagonalization of the s using a gauge transformation such as

(~x)  (1)x1(2)x2 . . . ((d1))x(d1) (~x)

resulting in the hamiltonian

hf = 

i

2x~x,j

(1)p j1

p=1 xp(cid:16)(~x + ~j)(~x)  (~x)(~x + ~j)(cid:17)

(2.97)

(2.98)

u 0[~x,~j] = (1)p j1

which describes 2[d/2] species of lattice fermions with background u(1) magnetic ux 
through every plaquette of the lattice. this ux is contained in the background u(1) eld
p=1 xp. each species of fermion must have the same spectrum as the
original one given by the dirac hamiltonian (2.95). this allows reduction of the fermion
multiplicity by a factor of 2[d/2] (by dropping the fermion spin index ). the result resembles
a condensed matter hopping problem with a single species of fermion where there is a
background magnetic eld  per plaquette.

2diracs -matrices are hermitean,

and, due to their anticommutator algebra,

they are also unitary.

charge density operator

 = mx~x

(1)p d1

p=1 xp(~x)(~x) .

(2.100)

to obtain the continuum limit and the number of fermion species, one rst divides the
lattice into 2d1 sublattices according to whether the components of their coordinates are
even or odd. for example, when (d  1) = 3, i label 8 fermion species as

(even, even, even)  1 , (even, odd, odd)  2
(odd, even, odd)  3 , (odd, odd, even)  4
(even, even, odd)  5 , (even, odd, even)  6
(odd, even, even)  7 , (odd, odd, odd)  8 .

(2.101)

2.3 strong coupling lattice gauge theory

this section is devoted to a detailed analysis of the strong coupling limit of hamiltonian lat-
tice gauge theories. i shall give a general introduction to the subject by considering a gauge
theory with colour group u (nc ) or su (nc ) and su (n )-avor groups. the hamiltonian
formalism is particularly suitable for illustrating the relationship between several gauge and
spin systems and was already exploited in some of the earliest studies of chiral symmetry
breaking in the strong coupling limit [15]. the strong coupling limit, though far from the
scaling regime is often used to study qualitative properties related to connement and chi-
ral symmetry breaking. in chapter 4, 5 and 6 i shall study the one-avor and multiavor
lattice schwinger models. the one-avor model will be mapped in the strong coupling limit
onto an antiferromagnetic ising model with long range coulomb interaction. the multiavor
schwinger models are eectively described by spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic su (n ) heisenberg
models.

2.3.1 hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theory

let us consider an hamiltonian lattice gauge theory [13] where space is a (d 1)-dimensional
hypercubic lattice with oriented plaquettes [x, i, j] with corners x, x + i, x + i + j, x + j and
orientation i  j. the gauge eld u [x, i] associated with the link [x, i] is a group element
in the fundamental representation [nc ] of su (nc ) and, if the color group is u (nc ), also
carries a representation of u (1). it has the property u [x,i] = u[x  i, i]. the electric
eld operator ea[x, i] associated with link [x, i] has the lie algebra

(cid:2)ea[x, i], eb[y, j](cid:3) = if abcec[x, i] ([x, i]  [y, j])
e[x,i] = u[x  i, i]e[x  i, i]u [x  i, i]

and

where

e[x, i]  ea[x, i]t a

with t a = (t a), a = 0 . . . ,n 2

c  1 the generators of the lie algebra of u (nc ) obeying

[t a, t b] = if abct c,

(2.118)

t 0 = 1 the nc  nc unit matrix representing u (1) and t a, a 6= 0, in the representation
[nc ] of su (nc). it generates the left-action of the lie algebra on u [x, i], i.e.,

(cid:2)ea[x, i], u [y, j](cid:3) = t au [x, i] ([x, i]  [y, j])

.

symmetry is

(2.123)

with the fermionic u(1) charge operator ordered so that, like e, it changes sign under charge
conjugation. (note that there is no ordering ambiguity for the ga, a 6= 0.) these generators
obey the lie algebra

[ga(x),gb(y)] = if abcgc(x)(x  y) .

(2.124)

22

the hamiltonian is gauge invariant,

[ga(x), h] = 0 .

(2.125)

the dynamical problem of lattice gauge theory is to nd the eigenstates of the hamilto-
nian operator eq.(2.120) which are also gauge invariant, i.e. which obey the physical state
condition

ga(x)|phys > = 0 .

(2.126)

2.3.2

strong coupling

in order to perform a strong-coupling expansion [31], let us rewrite eq.(2.120)

h = h0 + h1 + h2

2g2 (tru u u u + h.c.). each term

where h0 =p g2

is gauge invariant,

2 e2, h1 =p(tu  + h.c.) and h2 =p 1

[ga(x), hi] = 0.

therefore, if one nds a gauge invariant eigenstate of h0, perturbations in h1 and h2 remain
gauge invariant. h0 is the sum of group manifold laplacians for each link. if |0 > is a singlet
of the algebra (2.115), i.e.

then

and

ea[x, i]|0 >= 0,

h0|0 >= 0

h0u [x, i]|0 >=

g2
2

c2(nc )u [x, i]|0 >

(2.127)

in eq.(2.127) the casimir operator is

c2(nc )1 =xa

t at a

and a runs either from 0 (for u (nc )) or 1 (for su (nc )) to n 2

c  1.

consider the empty vacuum which is a singlet of (2.115) and which has no fermions,


a(x)|0 >= 0 , x, a, .

it is necessary to nd the lowest energy (e0= eigenvalue of h0) eigenstates | > of h0
which are gauge invariant,

ga(x)| >= 0 a, x,

with the constraint that the fermion states are half-lled, i.e. half of the fermion states are
lled.

i shall rst review the simplest case of su (nc  3) gauge theory with 1 lattice avor
(n = 1) and 2d/2[d/2] continuum avors [11]. the density is nc /2 fermions per site. the
lowest energy eigenstates of h0 with e0 = 0 are the states which are singlets of the electric
eld algebra (2.115) and, since they are gauge invariant they must also be color singlets,
i.e. singlets of the algebra (2.124). then, they must also be singlets of the algebra of the
fermion currents (x)t a(x). one can form a baryon (=color singlet) at a site by either

23

fermi statistics allows at most one singlet per site. otherwise one can distribute the n /2
singlets arbitrarily (n is the total number of lattice sites). thus, there are n !/((n/2)!)2
degenerate ground states with a typical state being

all matrix elements in the vector space of degenerate vacua of the rst order hamiltonian

so second order perturbation theory must be considered and the matrix with elements

must be diagonalized. the rst term is zero and diagonalizing the second term is equivalent
to diagonalizing the four-fermion hamiltonian

a(x + i)b(x)b(x)a(x + i) = kx[x,i]

now i consider arbitrary n . then the density is ncn /2 fermions per site and the

since this operator is symmetric in the lattice avor indices 1, . . . , nc , it carries an irre-
ducible representation of su (n ) with young tableau with nc columns and 1 row. fermi
statistics allows at most n singlets on a given site. thus, the allowed representations of the
avor su (n ) algebra at one site are the empty singlet and those with the young tableaux
given in g. (2.6) and which are distinguished by the fermion numbers

respectively. a ground state of h0 is obtained by creating nn /2 color singlets. the states
are labeled by the local fermion densities x and the vector in the corresponding su (n )
representation at each site and are degenerate.

again this degeneracy must be resolved by diagonalizing perturbations. the rst-order
perturbation to the vacuum energy vanishes and diagonalizing the second order perturba-
tions is equivalent to diagonalizing the eective hamiltonian

he = kx[x,i]

a (x + i)

b(x)b (x)

a(x + i) = kx[x,i]

(up to an additive constant) where the operators

j (x) =

(2.135)

thus, the eective hamiltonian is that of a u (n ) quantum antiferromagnet with represen-
tations given in g. (2.7) and with the constraint px x = 0, and i have shown that it
is equivalent to the strong coupling limit of su (nc ) lattice gauge theory with n lattice
avors of staggered fermions.

the su(2) color group is peculiar and this can be traced back to the fact that for 2
colors the singlet creation and annihilation operators involve only 2 fermion eld operators,
and in second order perturbation theory terms are generated describing the hopping of these
singlets [24]. due to this eq.(2.133) is not the right eective hamiltonian but

he = kx[x,i](cid:16)a (x)

and the j (x) as above. one can check that the operators j (x) and s
relations of the lie algebra of the symplectic group sp(2nl), i.e. eqs. (2.135) and

(2.138)

 (x) obey the

hence (2.136) is a sp(2nl) antiferromagnet. especially for n = 1 it is the spin 1/2 heisen-
berg antiferromagnet as originally found in [24].

if, instead of su (nc ) one had the gauge group u(nc ), gauge invariance would require

that one imposes the extra constraint

g0(x)| >= 0 , x.

this can be fullled without electric elds, i.e. with x = 0 x, only when n is even. then
the allowed su (nc ) representation at each site is the one with the young tableau given in
g. (2.7), and, with the constraint

j (x) = 0 ,

x

j (x) generate the su (n ) algebra in this representation. thus, u (nc ) gauge theory is
equivalent to an su (n ) quantum antiferromagnet in the representation g. (2.7). this
actually is true for all nc  1 (nc = 2 is not special here as no hopping of color singlets is
allowed for u (nc ) color groups [24]).

as a concrete example, let us consider the case n = 2 which gives 4 continuum avors
in d = 4. the su (nc  3) gauge theory is equivalent to a u (2) antiferromagnet. using the
identity
(2.142)

2 = ~  ~ + 

(with ~ the pauli matrices) one can change basis in the u(2) lie algebra to nd the eective
strong coupling hamiltonian

where

(2.144)
and the representation at a given site has either x = 0 and the spin s = nc /2 representation
of su (2) or x = nc and the spin s = 0.

(~  a ~
a)

if the gauge group is u (nc ) then the density is constrained, x = 0 and each site is
occupied by the s = nc /2 representation of su (2) and (2.143) is the hamiltonian of the
quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet.

the most subtle case is that of a u (nc ) lattice gauge theory with odd n . there i rst
solve the problem of minimizing the contribution of u(1) electric elds to the energy. this
is done by solving the auxilliary problem of minimizing the energy function

(x) = a (x)

(2.145)

if ncn is odd, the charge density (x) has only half-odd-integer eigenvalues x. since
they have no zero eigenvalue, the constraint eq.(2.145) cannot be satised unless the u (1)
electric eld is non-zero. this is also true of su (nc ) color singlet states, since they always
contain an integral multiple of nc particles. then the operator  has eigenvalue which is
an integer multiple of nc and when n is odd, the charge density (x) again has no nonzero
eigenvalues. the conguration which minimizes the u (1) energy is the most symmetric one,

e0[x,i] =  nc

with the accompanying eigenvalues of the charge density

x = nc

.

if, instead of u (1) electric elds, one had color non-singlets, the energy would be higher.
in chapter 4 the one-avor lattice schwinger model is studied as a concrete example with
nc = 1 and n = 1.

2.4 chiral anomaly on the lattice

we shall see in section (2.4.1) that under some mild assumption about the lattice action,
there are always an equal number of left- and right-handed weyl particles in the continuum
limit of a lattice fermionic theory. in the continuum the axial or chiral charge q5 is dened
as the integral of the chiral density of the current j

5 (x) = (x)5(x)

q5 =z d3xj0

5 (x) =z d3x(~x, t)5(~x, t)

(2.146)

according to eq.(2.146) q5 is the number of right-handed fermions minus the number of
left-handed fermions minus the number of right-handed antifermions plus the number of
left-handed antifermions. in the case of massless fermions q5 is conserved at the classical
level, not only in the case of free theories, but also in the case of interacting theories like

27

qed or -models [6]. at the quantum level the chiral symmetry is broken by the anomaly.
for example in massless qed the divergence of the axial current is given by [26]

j

5 (x) =

e2
162 f  (x)f (x)

(2.147)

there is no way to avoid the physical consequences of the anomaly; one might also dene a
conserved axial vector current, but it is not gauge invariant and the physical consequences
are unchanged. the axial anomaly appears in perturbation theory as a consequence of the
linear divergences in the triangle graph with an internal fermion loop, and either three axial
vector current insertions or one axial vector and two vector current insertions. the one-loop
quantum corrections to a chirally symmetric classical action are not chirally symmetric. it
is impossible regularize a quantum eld theory preserving both axial and gauge invariance.
since lattice gauge theories are manifestly gauge invariant, it is an interesting question how
axial anomaly appears there. in general the fermion doublers do contribute to the anomaly.
since the doublers appear with opposite chiralities, one might conclude that the anomaly
on the lattice is zero. however the question is more involved [31].

i am interested in analyzing how the anomaly manifests itself in the lattice schwinger
models with dierent avor groups. i already illustrated that staggered fermions explicitly
break the ua(1) symmetry but possess a discrete chiral symmetry corresponding to trans-
lations by one lattice spacing. as we shall see in chapters 4, 5 and 6 in the continuum
the ua(1) symmetry is broken by the anomaly either in the one-avor or in the multiavor
schwinger models. in chapter 4 we shall see that on the lattice in the one-avor case the
discrete chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously. at variance, in the two-avor model we
shall see in chapter 5 that the ground state is translationally invariant, i.e. does not break
the discrete chiral symmetry. the only relic of the continuum axial anomaly is the non-zero
vev of the umklapp operator.

2.4.1 the nielsen-ninomiya no-go theorem

nielsen and ninomiya [27] demonstrated that fermion theories on a lattice have an equal
number of species of left- and right-handed weyl particles, i.e. neutrinos, in the continuum
limit. the consequence of this behavior is a no-go theorem for putting theories of weak
interactions on a lattice. moreover it is not possible in strong interaction models to solve
the species doubling problem on a lattice in a chirally invariant way. the appearence of
equally many right- and left-handed species of weyl particles is an unavoidable consequence
of a lattice theory under some mild assumptions.

the hypothesis of this theorem are locality of the theory and exact conservation of
discrete valued quantum numbers and charges assumed to have a density dened from a
nite region.

if one is interested in the strong interactions and wants to study a dirac particle rather
than a weyl particle, there is no unsurmountable problem because a dirac particle can be
thought of as a composite of two weyl particles, a right-handed one and a left-handed one.
however there is no way to construct chiral invariant lattice models for qcd.

let us consider the general class of lattice fermion theories for which the bilinear part of

the action for the n-component complex fermion eld (~x) is of the form

sf = iz dtx~x

(~x)(~x) z dtx~x,~y

(~x)h(~x  ~y)(~y)

(2.148)

28

1
...
n

 =





with h an hamiltonian where interactions of quartic or higher degree in  are neglected. in
fact, one can dene the number of species of weyl fermions depending only on the bilinear
part of the action, while the interactions do not change the dispersion relation but just cause
scattering processes. the action sf should fulll the following three conditions

 locality of the interaction, i.e. h(~x)  0 fast enough as |~x|   that its fourier
transform h(~p) is a smooth function. thus the eigenvalues i(~p) (i = 1, . . . , n ) are
smooth except in the case that two eigenvalues i(~p) and i+1(~p) coincide

 translational invariance on the lattice
 hermiticity of the n  n matrix hamiltonian h.

the assumptions made for the charges q (lepton number, for instance) are

variables (~y) related to ~y within a bounded distance from ~x.

 exact conservation of q, even at the scales where the lattice cut-o is relevant
 q is locally dened q = p~x (~x). the charge density (~x) is a function of the eld
 q is quantized
 q is bilinear in the fermion eld (~x).

the weak interactions and the standard model exhibit right- and left-handed particles that
do not have the same hypercharge, so that parity and charge conjugation are broken in weak
interaction processes. this implies that if nature were indeed built on a lattice, it should be
possible to realize weyl fermions with dierent quantum numbers for left- and right-handed
ones.

one has thus to understand where is the problem: one must give up the idea that nature
is based on a fundamental lattice cut-o or some assumption of the no-go theorem, or weak
interactions phenomenology, i.e. the usual understanding of parity violation.

nielsen and ninomiya gave two proofs of their no-go theorem, a very technical one based
on algebraic topology and homotopy and a more intuitive topological proof. the proof is
mainly supported by the fact that the momentum space of lattice theory is periodic, i.e.
there is the brillouin zone


a  pi 


a



(2.149)

where the end points /a and /a are identied. from a topological point of view pi runs
on a circle s1, thus the momentum space makes up a hypertorus s1  s1  s1.

let review the intuitive proof of the no-go theorem for a general class of 1+1 dimensional
lattice fermion theories, whose action is the 1+1 dimensional version of the 3+1 dimensional
case eq.(2.148). one thus takes  to be a complex n-component eld in order to keep
generality. a generic 1 + 1 dimensional hamiltonian has non degenerate energy levels, in
fact, in order to have just two-level degeneracy i(p) = i+1(p) three parameters must
be restricted in the hamiltonian h(p), but there is only one p. however the wave packet
velocity

is non zero at the fermi energy

low energy excitations are such that fermion states with p close to pf are excited and for
particles relevant at low energies one has

i(pf ) = 0

(2.151)

i(p) = (p  pf )

di
dp |p=pf + o((p  pf )2)

(2.152)

the particle at the crossing point with i = 0 line is called a right(left) mover when

di
dp |p=pf > 0

(< 0)

(2.153)

antiparticles and particles have the same velocity. assuming locality i(p) is analytic in
p except for degeneracy points and a smooth curve i(p) is dened in i  p space. the
curve is closed since on a lattice p is dened modulo 2/a and thus runs on a circle s1.
such curves must cross equally many times from i(p) < 0 to i(p) > 0 as they cross from
i(p) > 0 to i(p) < 0. one can orient the curve such that it is along the increasing p
direction. the curve going up through i = 0 represents a right-mover and that going down
a left-mover. from a topological point of view there must be the same number of upgoings
and downgoings for the closed curve  see g. (2.8). therefore, there appear equally many

this is a relativistically invariant dispersion relation for a massless mover along the right or

dp |p=pf is considered equal to the velocity of light.

30

let us now turn our attention to the 3 + 1 dimensional case. the eigenvalue equation

for the hamiltonian eq.(2.148) reads

h(~p)(~p) = i(~p)(~p)

i = 1, . . . , n

(2.156)

with n ordered eigenvalues 1 > 2 > . . . > n . when two energy levels, the i-th and
(i+1)-th coincide, i.e. are degenerate, at the momentum ~pdeg,

i(~pdeg) = i+1(~pdeg) = 0

(2.157)

one can expand the n  n matrix h(p) near the degeneracy point ~pdeg. the most general
hamiltonian h (2)(~p) for the two component spinor u (p) describing the i-th and (i+1)-th
levels, is of the form

h (2)(~p) = deg(~pdeg) + (~p  ~pdeg)~b + (~p  ~pdeg)kv k

  + o((~p  ~pdeg)2)

(2.158)

with ~b and ~v constants. by introducing the shifted variables

h (2)(~p) reads

~p = ~p  ~pdeg

 =   deg

h (2)(~p) = ~pkv k

  + ~p ~b

let us dene further a new momentum

(2.159)

(2.160)

(2.161)

(2.162)
the sign  depends on the sign of detv which determines the relative handness of the ~p
and ~p coordinates. take conventionally ~p to be the right handed one. h (2)(~p) becomes

p0 =   (~p  ~pdeg)~b
p = ~pkv k



h (2)(~p) = ~  ~p

and one obtains the right and left handed weyl equation
~p ~u (~p) = p0u (~p)

(2.163)

(2.164)

corresponding to the sign of detv . wheter one has right- or left- handed weyl fermions
depends on the degeneracy point since the constant tensor ~v depends on ~pdeg.

one may call the degeneracy point a right or left handed one according to eq.(2.164).
each degeneracy point represents one species of weyl fermions. if the fermi energy surface
lies at the degeneracy points of the i-th and (i+1)-th, each degeneracy point represents one
species of weyl particles.

let us consider curves in 4-dimensional   ~p space or on the 3-dimensional dispersion

relation surface dened by

{(~p, i(~p))

| < a|i(~p) >= 0}

(2.165)

where

1 + a2(i)

2 + . . . + an (i)

< a|i(~p) >= a1(i)

(2.166)
the vector |a >= (a1, a2, . . . , an ) is an arbitrarily chosen constant in the complex n-
dimensional vector space, which may be chosen to be the basic vector corresponding to
the eld number one. eq.(2.166) species a 1-dimensional curve in the generic case, in fact
eq.(2.166) xes two variables since < a|i(~p > is a complex number and it is a continuous
and analytic complex-valued function of ~p. the set of curves always passes through all
the degeneracy points, as can be shown explicitly using the continuum 2-component weyl
equation near the degeneracy point ~pdeg. then one can construct a new state

n

|i(~p) >= |i(~p) > +|i+1(~p) >

(2.167)

31

near ~p = ~pdeg. one can always choose  and  such that

< a|i(~p) >= 0

(2.168)

which is the condition of eq.(2.166) for the curve. due to the existence of the brillouin zone
and the fact that the curves continuously pass through all the degeneracy points between
the energy levels i and i+1, such a curve must be closed or consists of a number of closed
curves. if the curves are oriented they must pass equally many times upward and downward
between the energy levels i and i+1, through all the degeneracy points. let us now orient
the curves and show that, when the curve crosses the level  = 0 between the levels i
and i+1 upward (or downward), the crossing point, i.e. the degeneracy point is a right- (or
left-) handed degeneracy point. the eigenstate determined by eq.(2.156) is unique modulo
a phase factor if one imposes the normalization condition < i(~p)|i(~p) >= 1. one can
choose the phase of |i(~p) > to be analytic in a simply connected region which should not
include the degeneracy points. an orientation of the curves is assigned by means of the phase
rotation of < a|i(~p) > on a small circle s1 around the curve (2.166). the convention is that
an increase of phase on s1 should form a right-handed screw together with the oriented curve
when one takes a right-handed coordinate convention for ~p. let us consider for example the
case the curve is along pz > 0 on the upper cone p0 > 0 near the right handed degeneracy
points. the two component eld u satises the equation

~p ~u (~p) = p0u (~p)

(2.169)

one draws a circle s1 with radius r around a point on the curve at a distance d from the
degeneracy point and let us take r  d. the point q on s1 is parametrized in the following
way

px = r cos 
py = r sin 
pz = d

the normalized eigenvector u of eq.(2.169) is solved in the limit r

d  1

since one obtains

r

u =(cid:18) 1
u =(cid:18) 1

2d ei (cid:19) .
0 (cid:19) .

on the curve r = 0, the vector < a| must be < a| = (0, 1) so that on s1

< a|i >=

r
2pz

ei

(2.170)
(2.171)

(2.172)

(2.173)

(2.174)

(2.175)

and according to the orientation convention the curve is oriented in the positive pz direction
because it forms a right handed screw. computing the case of p0 > 0 and pz < 0, p0 < 0
and pz < 0, p0 < 0 and pz > 0 one obtains g. (2.9a) for the right handed degeneracy point.
the case of left handed degeneracy point is depicted in g. (2.9b). as one can see in g.
(2.9), the curve continues through the degeneracy points conserving the orientation. the
orientation determined in this way becomes the same all along the curve. the important
fact is that the curve must be oriented away from the degeneracy point on the level sheet
with right-handed particles (i.e. with positive helicity), while the curve must be inward
oriented on the level with left-handed particles. finally the oriented curve is closed and
thus must go equally many times upward and downward through all the degeneracy points
i(~pdeg) = i+1(~pdeg) = 0 between the energy levels i(~p) and i+1(~p). when the dirac sea
(i+1 level) is lled and the fermi surface lies at the degeneracy point  = 0, there appear
equally many species of right- and left-handed weyl fermions. this concludes the proof of
this no-go theorem of nielsen and ninomiya.

the strong interaction lattice models for qcd invented by wilson, susskind and banks
and casher break chiral invariance in order to avoid the fermion doubling. drell, weinstein
and yankielowicz were able to construct a chiral invariant model for lattice qcd but it
breaks locality of the interaction. there is some proposal in the literature to avoid the
no-go theorem, giving up some of its hypothesis, and to put the standard model on the
lattice; but up to now no generally accepted scheme does exist.

nielsen and ninomiya pointed also out a similarity between the fermion system of lattice
gauge theories and the electron system of crystals. more precisely they pointed out that
there exists an eect analogous to the mechanism of the adler-bell-jackiw (abj) axial
anomaly in solid state physics. the main similarity between lattice fermions and real
electrons in crystals is that in both systems there is only the lattice translational invariance
which implies the brillouin zone existence. the crystal electrons are described by a one
component non-relativistic schrodinger equation, but the energy eigenvalues form bands. it
is possible to write the electron theory as a multicomponent lattice fermion theory with a
matrix hamiltonian. at points where two energy bands of the electrons make a contact in
the energy-momentum dispersion law space, the two band wave functions of the electrons
can be approximated by the weyl equation, and so, according to the no-go theorem, such
degeneracy points occur in pairs of the right-handed and left-handed type. there is no
net production of electrons like the abscence of the net production of weyl fermions in
lattice fermions theories when parallel electric, e, and magnetic, h, elds are put on. this
leads to the conservation of axial charge. the abj anomaly manifests itself by transferring
electrons from the neighborhood of the left-handed degeneracy point to the right-handed
one in energy-momentum space. in a parity non-invariant zero-gap semiconductor the eect
analogous to the abj anomaly gives rise to a peculiar behavior of the conductivity of the
electric current in the presence of the magnetic eld.

antiferromagnetic spin chains

the title of this chapter deserves an entire book to be properly developed, and in fact
some books, reviews and long articles about spin chains do already exist [34]. spin chains
interested mathematical physicists for their exact solvability, eld theorists for the possibility
to test their methods by comparation with exact results and condensed matter physicists for
the possibility to understand the spectra of real physical systems. it is my purpose to report
a self-contained analysis of antiferromagnetic spin chains, useful to understand chapter 5 and
6 where i shall show that the multiavor lattice schwinger models in the strong coupling
limit are eectively described by the spin-1/2 su (n ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains.

a common tool to study spin systems is spin-wave theory. spin-wave theory was devel-
oped by anderson, kubo and others [35] in the 1950s and it is a very powerful approach
to quantum magnetic systems in dimensions greater than one, predicting long-range order
and gapless goldstone bosons. the situation remained clouded for magnetic chains be-
cause it was known that long-range order could not occur in one dimension, but the bethe
ansatz predicts massless excitations. there is quasi-long-range-order corresponding to a
power law decay of spin-spin correlators and there are gapless excitations which are not true
goldstone bosons.

quantum spin chains have been extensively studied in the literature, starting from the
seminal paper by hans bethe [36] in 1931 for the spin-1/2 case, where he introduced an
ansatz to write down the eigenfunctions of the heisenberg hamiltonian, describing a chain
with periodic boundary conditions. seven years later hulthen [37] was able to compute the
ground state energy of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain. we had to wait until 1984 to
know exactly the spectrum of this model, when faddeev and takhtadzhyan [30] analyzed the
model using the algebraic bethe ansatz and showed that the only one-particle excitation is
a doublet of spin-1/2 quantum excitations with gapless dispersion relation. this excitation
is a kink rather than an ordinary particle and is called spinon. all the eigenstates of the
antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian contain an even number of kinks, nevertheless
the kinks are localizable objects and one can consider their scattering. there are no bound
states of kinks in this model.

the one dimensional spin systems are not only unusual because they are exactly solvable
but also for their incompatibility with long range order. actually solvability and absence of
long range order are deeply related concepts; systems with spontaneously broken symmetries
are more dicult to describe and resist analytical solutions. all isotropic antiferromagnetic
quantum spin chains with short range interactions exhibit quantum spin-liquid ground states
 i.e. states with short range antiferromagnetic correlations and no order. moreover these
chains have strange quantum elementary excitations above these ground states, that are not

35

ordinary spin waves but are usually called spinons  neutral spin-1/2 kinks.

as r. b. laughlin [38] points out:spinons are not like anything familiar to most of us,
but are instead an important and beautiful instance of fractional quantization, the physical
phenomenon in which particles carrying pieces of a fundamental quantum number, such as
charge or spin, are created as a collective motion of many conventional particles obeying
quantum mechanical laws. the fractional quantum number of the spinon is its spin. it is
fractional because the particles out of which the magnetic states are constructed are spin
ips, which carry spin 1.

one signicant result of my research [39, 40] has been to show explicitly how spinons
appear in lattice gauge theories. more precisely i showed that the massless excitations of
the two-avor schwinger model coincide with the spinons of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic
heisenberg model.

section (3.1) shows the failure of spin wave theory in one dimension, due to the infrared
divergencies. spin-spin correlation functions are computed in the spin wave theory and are
compared with exact expressions.

in section (3.2) i review the haldane-shastry model [41], a spin model discovered in-
dependently by haldane and shastry and in the context of one dimensional bose gas by
sutherland. the haldane-shastry model is a realization of the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain in
which the quantum disordered ground state and spinon excitations are particularly easy to
understand.

section (3.3) is devoted to review the bethe ansatz solution of the antiferromagnetic
heisenberg chain. moreover i shall compare the exact solution given in [30] with a study of
nite size chains of 4,6, and 8 sites. an original result presented is the thermodynamic limit
coecient of the states with n  2 domain walls composing the ground state. the spin-spin
correlation function px < g.s.|~sx  ~sx+2|g.s. > originally computed by m. takahashi [42],
is derived in a slightly dierent way. the vacuum expectation value of the square of the
vector ~v =px
in section (3.4) i introduce the spin-1/2 su (n ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains. to
provide an intuitive picture i study the su (3) two sites chain and i nd the ground state.
a short review of the literature on su (n ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains is provided.

~sx  ~sx+1 is computed in an approximate way.

3.1 failure of spin wave theory in d=1

in the limit of large spin s   the quantum nature of a magnetic system can be forgotten,
and one can consider the spin ~s as a classical vector in the three dimensional space. in fact
in this limit the spin commutator is much smaller than the square of the spin variables

the classical ground states of the heisenberg model are states with spins parallel for the
ferromagnetic case

(cid:2)sa, sb(cid:3) = iabcsc = o(s)  o(s2)

(3.1)

 . . .

36

or neighbouring spins antiparallel for the antiferromagnetic case

 . . .

the classical ground state of the antiferromagnet is called neel state. by introducing the
raising and lowering spin operators

the antiferromagnetic (j > 0) heisenberg hamiltonian reads

sx = s1

x  is2

x

hj = j

(s+

x sx+1 + sx s+

x+1)(cid:27)

(3.2)

(3.3)

the classical ferromagnetic ground state coincides with the quantum one, but the neel state
is not an eigenstate of hj due to the raising and lowering spin operators action.

it is an interesting question to investigate whether or not long-range antiferromagnetic

order occurs

< s3

xs3

0 >= m

(3.4)

where the sign depends whether x belongs to the even or odd sublattice. the spin wave
approach to this problem is to perturb away from the limit in which the neel state is exact.
this happens of course for a spin-s heisenberg antiferromagnet in the limit s  . in
this limit one expects that the uctuations of s3 around +s on one sublattice and s on the
other sublattice are very small. it is customary to study the eects of these uctuations using
the holstein-primakov transformation, which consists in parametrizing the spin operators
in terms of boson operators a and a on the sublattice of even sites a and b and b on the
sublattice of odd sites b. on the sublattice a one writes

s3 = s  aa
s = (2s)

1

2 a(1 

aa
2s

1
2

)

(3.5)

(3.6)

eqs.(3.5,3.6) for spin operators correctly reproduce the spin algebra. the state with maximal
s3 = s is a state with zero bosons. applying s on this state one creates a boson and so
lowers s3 by one. the state with s3 = s has 2s bosons and is annihilated by s. on
sublattice b one writes

s3 = s + bb
s = (2s)
2 (1 

1

bb
2s

1

2 b

)

(3.7)

(3.8)

using the holstein-primakov representation given by eqs.(3.5,3.6) and eqs.(3.7,3.8) and
studying the small uctuations around the neel state so that aa and bb are o(1)  s in
the large s limit, one may develop an expansion in 1
s by expanding the square roots in the
denition of s in eqs.(3.6,3.8). to quadratic order the hamiltonian (3.3) reads

h = j

n

xx=1ns2 + s(axax + bx+1bx+1 + axbx+1 + axbx+1)o

(3.9)

s have been dropped. in momentum space the hamiltonian (3.9)

where higher orders in 1
reads

hj = 2jsxk nk(akbk + akb

k) + (akak + bkbk)o

(3.10)

37

where

k =

eik + eik

2

= cos k = k

.

(3.11)

the hamiltonian (3.10) describes free bosons. let us take the bogoliubov transformation

where, since a and b are bosonic operators, one has

ck = ukak  vkb

k dk = ukbk  vka
k

|u|2  |v |2 = 1 .

to put to zero the o diagonal terms inverting eqs.(3.12) one has

(u 2 + v 2) + 2u v = 0

solving eq.(3.13) and eq.(3.14) one gets

the free excitations created by c and d are known as spin waves and correspond to the
innitesimal deviations of the spins away from the neel state. the dispersion relation for
spin waves is

that vanishes linearly at k = 0

e(k) = 2js(1  2
k)

where the eective light velocity is

e(k)  v|k|

v = 2js

in a eld theoretical language spin waves are gapless due to the goldstone theorem. in fact
there are two goldstone modes c and d corresponding to the breaking of so(3) down to
the so(2) rotations about the z axis. low energy long-wavelength spin waves correspond to
congurations where all regions are locally in some neel ground state but the direction of the
sublattice magnetization vector makes long-wavelength rotations. the two dierent modes
c and d have spin s3 = 1 and correspond to raising s3 on one sublattice or lowering it
on the other.

now one can compute the reduction in the sublattice magnetization due to quantum

eq.(3.22) indicates that the neel state is destabilized by quantum uctuations in one di-
mension even in the large s limit. the divergence of eq.(3.22) is in agreement with the
coleman and mermin-wagner theorems [43] preventing the spontaneous breaking of con-
tinuous symmetries in (1+1)-dimensions due to infrared divergences connected with the
goldstone bosons.

38

3.1.1 spin-spin correlators in spin wave theory

we have seen that the neel state is destabilized by quantum uctuations in d=1 even in
the classical limit s  . the spinspin correlation function to next order in 1

s is

< ~s0  ~sr > s2(cid:20)1 

1
s

log

r
a

+ o(

1

s2 )(cid:21)

(3.23)

eq.(3.23) indicates that at large s the system is ordered at small distances while the disorder
occurs at exponentially large scales

  es

(3.24)

more precisely, one should distinguish the r odd and even cases. to see this, it is instructive
to compute the nite distance correlators from spin wave theory. if r belongs to the odd
sublattice, the spin-spin correlator reads

< ~s0  ~sr > = s2"1 +
= s2(cid:20)1 +

(3.25)

while if r belongs to the even sublattice one has

< ~s0  ~sr > = s2"1 +
= s2(cid:20)1 +

1
s

1
s

poor already for r = 3, and starts to have no meaning at r = 5, where one gets even a wrong
sign, opposite to the right answer. i think that this is and interesting lesson that one can
learn from the failure of spin-wave theory. while, in studying short distance correlations
(r = 1, 2) one gets very good results in the spin-wave theory, quantum disorder prevails
for larger distances and so a neel state approximation cannot pick up the main features of
the system. the expected scale for the appearence of quantum disorder for s = 1
2 is, from
eq.(3.24),  = e

3.2 the haldane-shastry spin model

the haldane-shastry spin model [41] is a generalized spin-1/2 heisenberg hamiltonian with
long range inverse-square exchange interaction between spins. the inverse-square interaction
makes the model more easy to solve than the original heisenberg model and the description
of the excitation spectrum in terms of spin-1/2 spinons is particularly easy to understand.
the model can be considered as a discretized version of the calogero-sutherland model [44]
describing a one-dimensional bose gas with inverse square repulsions.

this paragraph shortly reviews the approach to the haldane-shastry model given by
laughlin et al.
in [34]. my purpose is to stress some feature of one-dimensional antifer-
romagnetic chains that are more intuitive to understand in this model than in the heisen-
berg model. the haldane-shastry hamiltonian describes n spin-1/2 particles distributed
equidistantly on a circle, coupled with an exchange interaction that decays proportional to
the inverse square of the chord between the spins

where each site is parametrized by the roots of the unity

zn
  1 = 0

(3.29)

(3.30)

and ~s is the spin operator on site . the hamiltonian eq.(3.29) is invariant, due to periodic
boundary conditions, under translations generated by t
~s  ~s+1

(3.31)

t

of course,

~s =

~sx

xx=1
h~s, ti = 0

.

.

(3.32)

(3.33)

moreover the hamiltonian eq.(3.29) is invariant under the special internal yangian sym-

metry [45]

where

~ =

hhhs, ~i = 0
z + z
2 x6=
z  z

(

i

)(~s  ~s)

(3.34)

(3.35)

the ground state of this model has the same functional form as the fractional quantum hall
ground state [46, 47]; it is a spin singlet in the case of n even and exhibits quantum disorder:
i.e. it has the same relation to the antiferromagnetically ordered neel state that a quantum
liquid has to a conventional crystal.

in the hard-core bosons picture, the spin  on a site corresponds to the presence of
a boson, the spin  to the abscence of a boson. the ground state wavefunction is the
complex coecient assigned to each conguration with n/2 bosons. the ground state of
the hamiltonian (3.29) reads

and its energy is

denote the localization of the n/2 bosons. it is easy to verify that the
where z1, . . . , z n
ground state wave function eq.(3.36) is real, and it is translationally invariant with momen-
tum 0 or  for n/2 even or odd. in fact the translated expression of one site of g.s. is
obtained by multiplying each of its arguments by z = ei 2
n and due to the fact g.s. is an
homogeneous polynomial of degree (n/2)2 one gets

g.s.(z1z, . . . , z n

2

z) = ei n 

2 g.s.(z1, . . . , z n

)

(3.38)

2

one can immediately verify that g.s. is a spin singlet. due to the fact that zj is constrained
to take n/2 possible values, i.e. that there are n/2 spins up (and n/2 down), szg.s. = 0.
moreover it is the lowest weight state

sg.s. = 0

(3.39)

it is worth stressing that it is very peculiar of this model the possibility to write down
in a closed form, so simple to read, the exact quantum ground state (3.36).
in general,
it is very dicult to write down in an easy compact form the ground state of a quantum
antiferromagnetic chain. in the case of the heisenberg antiferromagnet this is not possible
for a general n.

g.s. exhibits quantum disorder, i.e. the spin-spin correlation function

< ~s  ~s >=

< g.s.|~s  ~s|g.s. >

< g.s.|g.s. >

41

(3.40)

goes to zero as |zz|   so that it is a spin-liquid state. however the fall-o of eq.(3.40)
is slow and this is typical of half-integer spin systems that exhibit gapless excitations [48].
dierent is the case of integer spin systems that are strongly-disordered spin liquids with
exponential decay of correlations on a length scale  and have an energy gap for excitations
 = v

 , where v is the spin-wave velocity of a nearby ordered state.

the ground state eq.(3.36) is not degenerate, but the state

g.s.(z1, . . . , z n

) =

is almost degenerate with g.s.

and it has momentum  greater than g.s.. the state g.s. can be thought as g.s. plus a

spinons are relativistic excitations travelling with velocity vspinon and they exist because
quantum disorder exists whenever the total spin in the unit cell is half integral. a spin
liquid singlet ground state can exist only if the total number of spins is even. if n is odd the
total spin cannot be less than 1/2. since in the thermodynamic n   there can be no
dierence between n even and odd, the spin system must have already had a neutral spin- 1
2
spinon excitation at the beginning, i.e. eq.(3.47) describes a spinon. in the case of n odd,
the ground state is 4-times degenerate and is given by eq.(3.47) for m = 0 and n1
and
their  counterparts. even if more than one spinon is present in the chain, they keep their
identity. in the thermodynamic limit spinons are non-interacting excitations, some kind of
quantum kink-excitations. spinons are neither bosons nor fermions but they are semions,
i.e. particles obeying 1/2 statistics. the two-spinon wave function is given by

ab =yj

(zj  za)(zj  zb)yj<k

fractional statistics has nothing to do with the symmetry properties of ab under the
exchange of a with b, but it has to do with state-counting.

last i want to say that the the yangian symmetry operator eq.(3.35) represents a scaled

spin current. acting on the propagating spinon eq.(3.44) one gets

z|m >=(cid:26) n  1

the action of z on a multispinon state is the sum of all the spinon velocities.

i analysed the model at half lling, i.e. when every site is occupied by one particle. in
the presence of doping the possible congurations on each site are spin up, spin down and
empty site. when the lling is less than half, new quantum excitations called holons are
created. holons are charged quantum excitations of spin 0. new phenomena appear in
presence of holons and it is necessary to add to hhs a term describing the holon dynamics.
since my thesis is concerned with the relationships between spin chains and eld theories,
the half lling constraint is required. the reader interested in knowing more about holons
can look up ref. [49].

3.3 the bethe ansatz solution of the antiferromagnetic

heisenberg chain

in this paragraph the bethe ansatz solution of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain [30]
is discussed in detail. moreover i shall compare the exact solution given by l.d. faddeev
and l.a. takhtadzhyan in [30] with a study of nite size chains of 4, 6 and 8 sites. i show
that already these very small nite systems exhibit spectra that match very well with the
thermodynamic limit solution. i suggest to the reader interested in the subject the references
[34].

the bethe ansatz is a method of solution of a number of quantum eld theory and sta-
tistical mechanics models in two space-time dimensions. this method was rst suggested
by bethe [36] in 1931 from which takes its name. historically one can call this formulation
the coordinate bethe ansatz to distinguish it from the modern formulation known as al-
gebraic bethe ansatz. the eigenfunctions of some (1+1)-dimensional hamiltonians can be
constructed imposing periodic boundary conditions which lead to a system of equations for
the permitted values of momenta. these are known as the bethe equations which are also
useful in the thermodynamic limit. the energy of the ground state may be calculated in
this limit and its excitations can be investigated.

i review here the method applyied to the study of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg
chain [30]. in particular it is shown that there is only one excitation with spin-1/2 which
is a kink: physical states have only an even number of kinks, therefore they always have
an integer spin. the one dimensional isotropic heisenberg model describes a system of n
interacting spin- 1

2 particles. the hamiltonian of the model is

hj = j

n

(~sx  ~sx+1 
xx=1

1
4

)

.

(3.58)

where j > 0 (j < 0 would describe a ferromagnet) and the spin operators have the following
form

~sx = 11  12  . . . 

~x
2  . . .  1n .

(3.59)

they act nontrivially only on the hilbert space of the xth site. periodic boundary conditions
are assumed.

the hamiltonian (3.58) is invariant under global rotations in the spin space, generated

by

n

due to the periodic boundary conditions, under translations generated by the operator t ,

~s =

~sx

.

(3.60)

xx=1

the hamiltonian is invariant and [~s, t ] = 0.

t

: ~sx  ~sx1

(3.61)

in order to diagonalize hj it is convenient to use an eigenfunction basis of operators
commuting with hj , so obviously ~s2, sz and also t . let us sketch the coordinate bethe
ansatz technique. one has to introduce the false vacuum

| >x

all the other basis vectors have s3 < n
with the lowering operators sx . let us start from the generic state with s3 = n
n  1 spins up and m = 1 spin down

and from eq.(3.70) one gets

x+1 = x

x+1 = x1

x 6= n

1 = n = n 1  n = 1

.

(3.70)

(3.71)

(3.72)
(3.73)

setting 1 = 1 one has x = x1. there are n possible values for x, corresponding to the
n roots of the unity. one of these roots corresponds to a state with s = n
2

n

xx=1

|x >= s| >   = 1

(3.74)

while the other n  1 roots have s = n

2  1.

the generic case with m spins down is more complicated. let us consider the case m = 2

to understand what happens

|m = 2 >=

n

xx1<x2=1

(x1, x2)|x1, x2 > with |x1, x2 >= sx1 sx2| > .

(3.75)

by requiring the translational invariance of the state |m = 2 > one has

and for x2 < n one has

that would easily give

t|m = 2 >= t|m = 2 >

(x1 + 1, x2 + 1) = t (x1, x2)

(x1, x2) = x11

, t = 12

45

(3.76)

(3.77)

(3.78)

but due to the periodic boundary conditions one has to nd coecients (x1, x2) that satisfy
not only eq.(3.77) but also

(1, x + 1) = t (x, n )

.

(3.79)

eq.(3.79) is no more satised by (3.78). bethe proposed the following ansatz for the coe-
cients (x1, x2)

(x1, x2) = a1,2x11

eq.(3.77,3.79) are satised if the following equations hold

a21 = a12n

.

by imposing to |m = 2 > to be an highest weight state
s+|m = 2 >= 0

taking into account eq.(3.81,3.82) and introducing the following change of variables

(3.88)

energy and momentum are thus additive as if there were m independent particles and the
 must satisfy the bethe ansatz equations (3.86) in order for em and pm to be eigenvalues
of the hamiltonian and momentum operators.

the solution of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain is reduced to the solution of the
system of the m algebraic equations (3.86). this, in general, is not an easy task. it can be
shown [30], however, that, in the thermodynamic limit n  , the complex parameters 
have the form
(3.89)

l = j,l + il

,

l = l,l + 1, . . . , l  1, l;

where l is a non-negative integer or half-integer, j,l is the real part of the solution of
(3.86) and i shall dene shortly the set of allowed values for the integer index j. the s
that, for a given j,l, are obtained varying l between [l, l] by integer steps, form a string
of length 2l + 1, see g.(3.1). this arrangement of s in the complex plane is called the
string hypothesis [30]. in the following i shall verify that, even on nite size systems, the
string hypothesis is very well fullled.

figure 3.1: strings for l = 0, 1

2 , 1, 3

2

in a generic bethe state with m spins down, there are m solutions to (3.86), which can
be grouped according to the length of their strings. let us denote by l the number of
strings of length 2l + 1, l = 0, 1
2 , . . .; strings of the same length are obtained by changing
the real parts, j,l, of the s in (3.89); as a consequence
j = 1, . . . , l. if one denotes
the total number of strings by q one has

q =xl

l , m =xl

(2l + 1)l .

(3.90)

the set of integers (m, q,{l}) constrained by (3.90), characterizes bethe states up
to the xing of the q numbers j,l; this set is called the conguration. varying m , q
and l, one is able to construct all the 2n eigenstates of an heisenberg antiferromagnetic
chain of n sites [30]. the energy and momentum of the bethes state, corresponding to
a given conguration  within exponential accuracy as n    consist of q summands
representing the energy and momentum of separate strings. for the parameters j,l of
the given conguration, taking the logarithm of (3.86) the following system of equations is
obtained in the thermodynamic limit

where

(3.92)

integer and half integer numbers qj,l parametrize the branches of the arcotangents and,
consequently, the possible solutions of the system of eqs.(3.91). in ref.[30] it was shown that
the qj,l are limited as

with qmax

if l1 = l2

.

(3.95)

the admissible values for the numbers qj,l are called the vacancies and their number for
every l is denoted by pl

pl = 2qmax

l + 1 .

(3.96)

the main hypothesis formulated in [30] is that to every admissible collection of qj,l
there corresponds a unique solution of the system of equations (3.91). the solution always
provides, in a multiplet, the state with the highest value of the third spin component s3.

let us now consider some simple example. the simplest conguration has only strings

of length 1, i.e. all the s are real. the singlet associated to this conguration

m = q = 0 =

n
2

,

l = 0

, l > 0

,

(3.97)

is the ground state. the vacancies of the strings of length 1, i.e. the admissible values of
qj,0, due to eqs.(3.93,3.94,3.95), belong to the segment

n
4



+

1
2  qj,0 

n
4 

1
2

.

(3.98)

therefore they are n/2. all these vacancies must then be used to nd the n/2 strings of
length 1. as a consequence this state is uniquely specied and no degeneracy is possible.

next i consider the conguration that provides a singlet with 1 string of length 2 and

all the others of length 1:

m =

n
2

,

q =

n
2  1 ,

0 =

n
2  2

,

 1
2

= 1

,

l = 0 , l >

1
2

.

(3.99)

for the strings of length 1 the number of vacancies is again n/2; for the string of length 2
there is one vacancy and the only admissible qj,1 equals 0. thus, since the number of strings
of length 1 is 0 = n
2  2, there are two vacancies for which eqs.(3.91) have no solution; they
are called holes and are denoted q(h)
2 . this conguration is determined by two
parameters: the positions of two holes which vary independently in the interval (3.98).

and q(h)

1

there is another state with only 2 holes: the triplet corresponding to the conguration

m = q = 0 =

n
2  1

,

l = 0 , l > 0

(3.100)

the number of vacancies for the strings of length 1 equals n

2 + 1, while 0 = n

2  1.

the excitations determined by the congurations (3.99,3.100) belong to the conguration
class called in [30] maf . the class maf is characterized as follows: the number of strings
of length 1 in each conguration belonging to this class diers by a nite quantity from n/2,
0 = n
2  k0 where k0 is a positive nite constant, so that the number of strings of length
greater than 1 is nite. from (3.96) one then has

p0 =

n
2

+ k0  2xl>0

l

pl = 2k0  2 xl>0

j(l, l)l , l > 0

(3.101)

(3.102)

so that

p0 

n
2

, pl < 2k0 , l > 0 .

(3.103)

48

from (3.101) follows that the number of holes for the strings of length 1 is always even and
equals 2 only for the singlet and the triplet excitations discussed above. one can imagine the
class maf as a sea of strings of length 1 with a nite number of strings of length greater
than 1 immersed into it. it was proven in [30] that, in the thermodynamic limit, the states
belonging to maf have nite energy and momentum with respect to the antiferromagnetic
vacuum, whereas each of the states which corresponds to a conguration not included in the
class maf has an innite energy relative to the antiferromagnetic vacuum.

let us now sketch the computation of the thermodynamic limit ground state energy.

(3.128)

in [30] it was also proved the remarkable fact that the string of length 2 does not contribute
to the energy and momentum of the excitation, so that the singlet and the triplet have the
same dispersion relations

s(1, 2) = t (1, 2) = (1) + (2)

(3.131)

the only dierence between the state whose conguration is given in eq.(3.100) and the
state of eq.(3.99) is the spin.

to summarize, the nite energy excitations of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain
are only those belonging to the class maf and are described by scattering states of an
even number of quasiparticles or kinks. the momentum p of these kinks runs over half the
brillouin zone   p  0, the dispersion relation is (p) = j
2 sin p, eq.(3.121), and the spin
of a kink is 1/2. the singlet and the triplet excitations described above are the only states
composed of two kinks, the spins of the kinks being parallel for the triplet and antiparallel
for the singlet. for vanishing total momentum all the states belonging to maf have the
same energy of the ground state so that they are gapless excitations. since the eigenstates
of hj always contain an even number of kinks, the dispersion relation is determined by a
set of two-parameters: the momenta of the even number of kinks whose scattering provides
the excitation. there are no bound states of kinks.

3.3.1 finite size antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains

let us now turn to the computation of the spectrum of nite size quantum antiferromagnetic
chains by exact diagonalization. we shall see that already for very small chains, the spectrum
is well described by the bethe ansatz solution in the thermodynamic limit. furthermore,
an intuitive picture of the ground state and of the lowest lying excitations of the strongly
coupled two-avor lattice schwinger model emerges, due to the mapping of the gauge model
onto the spin chain  see chapter 5.

the states of an antiferromagnetic chain are classied according to the quantum numbers
of spin, third spin component, energy and momentum |s, s3, e, p >. for a 4 site chain the
momenta allowed for the states are: 0, 

2 mod 2. the ground state is

2 , 3

|g.s. >= |0, 0,3j, 0 >=

1
12

(2| > +2| > | > | > | > | >)
(3.132)

.

51

this state is p -parity even. in fact, by the denition of p -parity given in eq.(5.29), the
p -parity inverted state (3.132) is obtained by reverting the order of the spins in each vector

| . . . > appearing in (3.132), e.g. | > p | >.

the s associated to the ground state (solution of the bethe ansatz equations (3.86))

are 1 =  1
23

and 2 = 1
23

. there is also an excited singlet

|0, 0,j,  >=

1
4

(| > | > | > +| >)

.

(3.133)

it is p -even, so that it is a sp = 0+ excitation, with the same quantum numbers (the
isospin is replaced by the spin) of the lowest lying singlet excitation of the strongly coupled
schwinger model discussed by coleman [50]. the state (3.133) also coincides with the excited
singlet described by the conguration (3.99). it has only two complex s which arrange

themselves in a string approximately of length 2, 1 = 2 = iq48117

holes with q(h)

2 and q(h)

2 = 1

1 =  1

and there are two

there are also three excited triplets, whose highest weight states are

.

(3.134)

(3.135)

(3.136)

among these, only the non-degenerate state with the lowest energy has a well dened p -
parity (3.135). it is a sp = 1 like the lowest lying triplet of the two-avor strongly coupled
schwinger model. the degenerate states can be always combined to form a p -odd state.

we thus see that within the states in a given conguration there is always a representative
state with well dened parity, the others are degenerate and can be used to construct state of
well dened energy and parity. moreover the parity of the representative states (with respect
to the parity of the ground state) is the same of the one of the lowest-lying schwinger model
excitations in strong coupling.

all the triplets in (3.136) have one real  and two holes; they can be associated with
the family of triplets (3.100). in table (3.3) i summarize the triplet s and q(h)s. the

this state is odd under p -parity. the spectrum of the six sites chain is reported in g.(3.3).
there are 9 triplets in the spectrum. in [51] it was already pointed out that the number of
lowest lying triplets for a nite system with n sites is n (n + 2)/8, so for n = 6 there are 6
lowest lying triplet states. in order to identify these 6 states among the 9 that are exhibited
by the spectrum of g.(3.3), it is necessary to compute their s and their qs. in this way
in fact, i can nd out which are the triplets characterized by two holes and thus belonging
to the triplet of type (3.100). in table (3.4) i report the internal quantum numbers of the
lowest lying triplets. the q(h)s vary in the segment [ 3
2 ]. the highest weight state of
the triplet of zero momentum and energy (j/2)(5 + 5) reads

(| > +| > +| > +| >

.

one can get the triplet of energy (j/2)(5  5) from (3.139) by changing 5  5. as

can be explicitly checked from (3.139), the two non-degenerate triplets of zero momentum
are then p -parity even, namely they have opposite parity with respect to that of the ground
state, as it happens for the lowest lying triplet excitations of the two-avor schwinger model.

53

for what concerns the degenerate triplets of momenta /3 and 5/3 (or 2/3 and 4/3)
they do not have denite p -parity, but it is always possible to take a linear combination of
them with parity opposite to the ground state.

the remaining three triplets in g.(3.3) have no real s and are characterized by a string
of length 2 and four holes for q =  3
2 , i.e. do not belong to the type (3.100). more
precisely, two triplets have a string approximately of length 2, due to the nite size of the
system, while the triplet of momentum  has a string exactly of length 2. in table (3.5) i

in g.(3.3) it is shown that the spectrum exhibits ve singlet states. the lowest lying
state at momentum  is the ground state. then there are three excited singlets characterized
by the conguration with two holes (3.99), i.e. they have one real  and a string of length
almost 2. in table (3.6) i summarize their quantum numbers. among these singlets, those
which are not degenerate, have p -parity equal to that of the ground state (odd) as it happens
in the two-avor schwinger model. the non- singlet in fact reads

 | > | > | > | > | > | >} .(3.140)

the degenerate singlets are again not eigenstates of the p -parity, but it is always possible
to take a linear combination of them with the a p -parity that coincides with that of the
representative state (3.140) of the conguration.

it is char-

even in nite systems very small like the 4 and 6 sites chains, the string hypothesis

the same spin.

the ground state of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with n sites is a linear

n

2 spins up and n

2 (cid:19) states with n

combination of all the (cid:18) n

2 spins down. these states
group themselves into sets with the same coecient in the linear combination according to
the fact that the ground state is translationally invariant (with momentum 0 () for n
2 even
(odd)), it is an eigenstate of p -parity and it is invariant under the exchange of up with down
spins. the states belonging to the same set have the same number of domain walls, which
2 adjacent spins up and n
ranges from n , for the two neel states, to 2 for the states with n
adjacent spins down.

the explicit computation of spin-spin correlations is far from being trivial since the correlator

computed by m. takahashi [42] in his perturbative analysis of the half lled hubbard model
in one dimension. for r > 2 no exact numerical values of g(r) are known. in [52] were given
two representations of g(r), while in [53, 54] the exact asymptotic (r  ) expression of
g(r) was derived.

in the following i shall show how the knowledge of this correlator allows one to compute
explicitly the rst three emptiness formation probabilities, used in ref. [52] in the study
of the heisenberg chain correlators, g(r). the isotropy of the heisenberg model implies
that

< g.s.|~sx  ~sx+2|g.s. >= 3

< g.s.|s3

x  s3

x+2|g.s. > .

(3.160)

let us introduce the probability p3 for nding three adjacent spins in a given position in the
heisenberg antiferromagnetic vacuum. taking advantage of the isotropy of the heisenberg
model ground state and of its translational invariance, it is easy to see that the correlator
(3.160) can be written in terms of the p3s as

< g.s.|s3

x  s3

x+2|g.s >= n

the factor 2 appears in (3.161) due again to the isotropy of the heisenberg model: the
probability of a conguration and of the conguration rotated by  around the chain axis,
are the same.

in [52] the so called emptiness formation probability p (x) was introduced.

and 3
in the antiferromagnetic vacuum. one gets

so that eq.(3.158) reads

p () = p (3)
p () = p (1)  2p (2) + p (3)

for the general emptiness formation probability p (x) of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg
chain, an integral representation was given in [52], but, to my knowledge, the exact value of

it is possible to extract a numerical value from eq.(3.172) only within the random phase
approximation [42, 55]. for this purpose it is rst convenient to rewrite the unconstrained
sum over the sites x and y as a sum where all the four spins involved in the vevs lie on
dierent sites,

the form < (...) >< (...) >. this is easily checked also by direct computation on nite size
systems.

correlation functions g(r) up to a distance of r = 30 the results are reported in table (3.7)

it is my purpose to introduce spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains where spins
are generators of the su (n ) group. in the limit n = 2 one has the usual antiferromagnetic

space to a representation with young tableau of m rows for x even and n  m rows for x
odd. for each site x (x) is the generator of the u (1) subgroup of u (n ).

let us use the basis t  = (t ),  = 1, . . . ,n 2  1, of the lie algebra of su (n ) in the

the representations of the su (n ) spins relevant for the relationship of the spin hamil-

is even i shall consider the representation on each site with young tableau of one column
and n /2 rows so that (x) = 0. when n is odd i shall consider on one sublattice the
representation with young tableau of one column and (n + 1)/2 rows and of one column
and (n  1)/2 rows on the other sublattice.

as an explicit example let us consider the case n = 3. the generators t  of the su (3)
group in eq.(3.192) are the gell mann matrices. by denoting u,d and s the three avors,
the eight spin operators s

let us nd the ground state of the hamiltonian (3.194) for a chain of two sites. taking the
representations with one particle on site 1 and two particles on site 2, the ground state with

(3.205)

in eq.(3.205) the linear combination with the + has momentum zero and the one with
the  has momentum . by studying this very simple example, one can infer that the
thermodynamic limit n   analysis for a generic su (n ) chain is very involved.

61

unfortunately, no analysis with a level of completeness such as the one given in [30] for
the su (2) case does exist for a generic symmetry group su (n ) with spins in the represen-
tation in which i am interested. in [57] su (n ) antiferromagnetic models were solved for a
particular spin representation such that the hamiltonian (3.194) becomes

h su(n )

j

= j

pxx+1

n

xx=1

(3.206)

with pxx+1 the operator that permutes whatever objects occupy sites x and x + 1. the
spectrum of eq.(3.206) was shown to exhibit massless excitations.

a large n expansion approach has been performed in [58] for an su (n ) antiferromag-
netic chain characterized by spins living in a representation with young tableaux of one row
on one sublattice and n  1 rows on the other sublattice. in the case of young tableaux
of one column it was found that the ground state is twofold degenerate and breaks transla-
tional and parity symmetry. moreover the elementary excitations are massive non relativistic
solitons in the large n limit with a mass of o(n ).

in [59] the lieb-shultz-mattis theorem [60] was generalized to su (n ) spin chains. the
theorem proves that a half-integer-s spin chain with essentially any reasonably local hamil-
tonian respecting translational and rotational symmetry either has zero gap or else has de-
generate ground states spontaneously breaking translational and parity invariance. in [60]
it was proved the existence of a unique ground state of the su (n ) chains where n is even
for spins in the antisymmetric n tensor representation. under the assumption of a unique
ground state which must be a su (n ) singlet, an innitesimal energy gap was found for all
the representations of su (n ) whose young tableaux contain a number of boxes not divisible
by n . of course the degeneracy of the ground state trivially implyes a zero gap.

using the lieb-shultz-mattis i can state that when n is even the ground state of the
hamiltonian (3.194) is unique and there are gapless excitations for the spin representation
with a young tableau of one column and n /2 rows. when n is odd the ground state is
twofold degenerate, as i illustrated with the simple example of the two site su (3) chain. it is
doubtful if there exist gapless excitations in this case and at present time i am investigating
this problem.

chapter 4

the one-avor lattice schwinger
model

in this chapter i study the one-avor lattice schwinger model in the strong coupling limit
using staggered fermions and the hamiltonian approach to lattice gauge theories [61]. even
though the continuous axial symmetry is broken explicitly by the staggered fermions, the
discrete axial symmetry remains and appears in the lattice theory as a translation by one
site.
in the continuum gauge model the chiral symmetry is broken by the anomaly. an
interesting issue which arises in the lattice regularization of gauge theories is how the lattice
theory produces the eects of the axial anomaly. lattice eld theory are manifestly gauge
invariant by construction and therefore, to produce continuum theories, they must nd a
way to violate axial current conservation. normally, in lattice gauge theories axial anomalies
are either cancelled by fermion doubling or else the lattice regularization breaks the axial
symmetry explicitly. the lattice schwinger model in the hamiltonian formalism with one
species of staggered fermions represents the unique example where neither of these occur.
the eects of the anomaly are not cancelled by doubling since the continuum limit of (1+1)-
dimensional staggered fermions produce exactly a dirac fermion which is the matter content
of the model. furthermore, even if the continuum axial symmetry is explicitly broken, the
remaining discrete axial symmetry must be spontaneously broken. the mass operator 
is odd under discrete axial transformations, if this symmetry is unbroken then <  >= 0.
however, in the continuum theory it is known that [62],

(cid:10) (x)(x)(cid:11) = 

e
2

ec

.

(4.1)

where  = 0.577... is the euler constant. the expectation value in eq.(4.1) is the chiral
condensate. 1 i shall show that the chiral condensate (4.1) is non-zero also on the lattice
and the discrete axial symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken. in addition to the analysis
of the chiral symmetry breaking pattern on the lattice, by performing a strong coupling
expansion around a gauge invariant ground state i shall derive results converging more
rapidly to the continuum than the results provided in [63]. the one-avor schwinger model
has also been used as an example of the fact that quantum link models may reproduce the
physiscs of conventional hamiltonian lattice gauge theories [65].

1it is worth to stress that the sign of the chiral condensate in eq.(4.1) is just a convention. the chiral
condensate has always the opposite sign of the fermion mass m that appears in the lagrangian of the theory:
it is the order parameter for a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the chiral symmetry. the chiral condensate
is the analogous of the magnetization for a spin model and the mass m plays the role of the magnetic eld.
so even if one is studying a massless model, in order to decide the sign of the chiral condensate, one has to
consider a small mass term m that then one sends to zero. the minus sign which appears in eq.(4.1) is due
to the fact that one considers the m  0+ limit in the schwinger model lagrangian.

63

4.1 denition of the model

the continuum schwinger model [28, 64] is the prototypical example of a solvable model
where the anomaly occurs.
it is 1+1-dimensional electrodynamics with a single charged
massless dirac spinor eld. the action is

s =z d2x((i + a) 

1
4e2
c

f f  )

it is invariant under gauge transformations,

(x)  ei(x)(x), (x)  (x)ei(x)

a  a + (x)

and, formally, under the axial phase rotation,

(x)  ei5(x), (x)  (x)ei5

(where 5 = i01).

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

at the classical level the above symmetries lead to conservation laws for the vector and

axial currents,

j(x) = (x)(x),

j
5 (x) = (x)5(x),

(4.6)

respectively. at the quantum level both currents cannot be simultaneously conserved. if
the regularization is gauge invariant, so that the vector current is conserved, then the axial
current obeys the anomaly equation [66]

j

5 (x) =

e2
c
2

 f (x).

(4.7)

moreover, the correlation functions of the model do not exhibit axial symmetry.

there are only neutral particles in the spectrum of the schwinger model; notably, the

bound state boson created by the axial current operator,

(x) = j

5 (x)

appears in the spectrum as a free pseudoscalar with mass ec .

in terms of the boson eld, the action is

s =z d2x(

1
2

 +

e2
c
2

2)

(4.8)

(4.9)

and the correlation functions for the vector and axial currents are obtained from the corre-
lation functions of derivatives of the bose elds. the coupling constant ec has the dimension
of a mass and the model is super-renormalizable.

since the schwinger model is solvable it has often been used as a eld theory where
methods of lattice gauge theory, particularly the strong coupling expansion can be tested
and compared with exact results of the continuum model [63].

in this chapter, i shall revisit the lattice quantization of the schwinger model. my main
purpose is to demonstrate two results. one is to show how the eects of the anomaly appear
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. the other is to demonstrate that a strong coupling
expansion around a gauge, parity and charge conjugation invariant lattice ground state can
produce results in good agreement with the continuum. my results turn out to be quite

64

dierent from those of previous strong coupling computations [63]. the dierence arises
from my careful treatment of the normal ordering of the charge density operator, which
must be dened so as to be compatible with all of the discrete symmetries of the theory.
the necessity of careful normal ordering of the charge operator was pointed out in [24]. my
vacuum state, vacuum energy and energies of elementary excitations are dierent from those
in [63, 67] and, as i shall show, they give a more accurate extrapolation to the continuum
limit.

the hamiltonian and gauge constraint of the continuum schwinger model are

electric elds, ax and ex, on the links [x; x + 1], n is an even integer and, when n is nite,
i use periodic boundary conditions. when n is nite, the continuum limit is the schwinger
model on a circle [68, 62]. the coecient t of the hopping term in (4.12) plays the role of
the lattice light speed. in the naive continuum limit, el = ec and t = 1. however, i shall
keep el and t as parameters which can be adjusted to t the lattice values of quantities such
as the mass gap and the chiral condensate to those which are known in the continuum.

when ax = 0, the spectrum of the hopping hamiltonian is (pa) = t sin pa(p  [0, 2

in the low energy limit it resembles a massless relativistic spectrum for excitations near
the fermi level. the two intersections of the energy band with the fermi level provide the
continuum right and left moving massless fermions. the electron ground state is invariant
under charge conjugation only when the fermi level is at (pf ) = 0 (i.e. when exactly half

of the fermion states are lled and px < (x) >= 0). in the remainder of this paper i

consider only this case of half-lling.

one has two possile ways to put the spinors  =(cid:18) 1

2 (cid:19) on the lattice in the staggered

fermion formalism. one can put upper components on even sites and lower components on
odd sites or viceversa. the mass operator, which reduces to  in the continuum limit is
the staggered charge density

the lattice schwinger model is equivalent to a one dimensional quantum coulomb gas
on the lattice. to see this one can x the gauge, ax = a (coulomb gauge). eliminating

for the moment, let us ignore the constant modes e and a. the rst term in the hamiltonian
is the quantum x-y model which has a disordered ground state (of course, exact solution of
this model is obtained by the inverse jordan-wigner transformation [60, 69]). the second
is a long-ranged ising interaction. i will prove in the next section that, in spite of the low
dimensionality of this system, the latter term has a neel ordered ground state. this is a
result of the innite range of the coulomb interaction. when both terms are present in the
hamiltonian, they compete, the rst one favoring disorder and the second one favoring order.
later, when i extrapolate my strong coupling results to the continuum limit, i shall assume
that the ordered ground state persists for all positive values of the dimensionless constant

66

e2
la2/t. the strong coupling limit is where this constant is large and the ground state has
neel order. the continuum limit of the schwinger model is found where this constant is
small. i shall assume that the neel order persists in that limit. 2

i shall examine the schwinger model in the strong coupling limit. to solve the lattice
schwinger model in the strong coupling expansion, it is necessary to nd states which are
annihilated by the generator of gauge transformations

and, at the same time, are eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian

coulomb energy. furthermore, e| >= 0 = e| > so | > and | > minimize the energy
of the zero mode. therefore, they are degenerate ground states of hu.

the ground states are invariant under parity and charge conjugation but they both
break chiral symmetry, i.e. the symmetry under translations by one site. the ivariance

the order parameter of the chiral symmetry, the mass operator m = 1
n apx m (x), is
diagonal in these states and has eigenvalue 1
2 . 3 in order to have a chiral condensate of
negative sign as in the continuum, one has to consider the mass operator m(x) = m (x).
it is interesting that the ground states are degenerate and are not invariant under chiral
symmetry, even in nite volume and in one spatial dimension; it is possible due to the
long-ranged nature of the coulomb interaction [43]. the chiral symmetry is spontaneously
broken in the innite volume limit. it is essential that the number of sites of the lattice, n,
is even.

of course once perturbations from the hopping term in the fermion hamiltonian are
taken into account, when the volume is nite, there are high order terms (of order n ) in
the strong coupling perturbation theory which mix the ground states that are constructed
by perturbing | > and | >. the mixing amplitude is

this is an eigenstate of the discrete axial transformation, with eigenvalue 1. thus the true
ground state is chirally symmetric.

in order to avoid this restoration of the symmetry, it is necessary to take the innite n
limit so that the two ground states are not mixed to any nite order of perturbation theory.
thus, in the perturbative expansion one only has to consider diagonal matrix elements
and, consequently, perturbation theory for non-degenerate-states.
i shall then choose as
unperturbed ground state | >. the results concerning the energies would have been the
same had i chosen | >.

and have energy e2
2 |i  j| greater than the ground state energy. a single electron, in order
to have a gauge invariant state, must be attached to a line of electric ux which goes from
the electron to innity. this is not allowed at all in a nite volume with periodic boundary
conditions and on the innite lattice, the string of electric ux would have innite energy.
thus electric charges are conned and the string tension is given by the electric charge e2

(4.56)

the phases eia in the hopping hamiltonian are irrelevant until one reaches the n th order
in the perturbative expansion. as a matter of fact, only at this order the transverse electric
eld becomes important. by direct evaluation one gets

next i compute the energies of the low-lying excitations to the same order in the per-
turbative expansion. the lowest-lying excitations are degenerate and are created by the
operators

l(x) = xeiax+1
r(x) = x+1eiax

(4.61)

(4.62)

which move a particle one lattice spacing to the left and right respectively. when they act
on the vacuum | > they create the two states

|x, r >  r(x)| >= x+1eiax| >
|x, l >  l(x)| >= xeiax+1| >

(4.63)

(4.64)

which are degenerate in energy (see eq.(4.92)). in order to resolve the degeneracy of these
two states, one must nd the rst nontrivial order of the perturbative expansion in which
the two states are mixed; this turns out to be the second order. it is easy to show that the
second order of perturbative expansion is diagonal in the two states which are created by
the parity odd and even operators

in fact

h(x)  r(x) + l(x)
h+(x)  r(x)  l(x) .

p h(x) = h(x) .

(4.65)

(4.66)

(4.67)

the parity odd operator creates the state with lower energy. thus, it is this the state
which will have nite energy gap in the continuum limit and which will correspond to the
pseudoscalar boson of the continuum schwinger model.
in the continuum one gets this

70

massive excitation by applying the vector ux j1 = j0
5 to the vacuum. the excitation
created by h+ is the scalar excitation which in the continuum limit decouples from the
spectrum. since one is interested in the masses of these excitations, one has to compute
their energies at zero momentum.

on the lattice the construction of the pseudoscalar excitation at zero momentum is

5one must be careful in applying one more time the hopping hamiltonian. since the coulomb hamilto-

two times the hopping hamiltonian to the state | > which has not a gap of 3 with respect to the ground
state, but it has a gap of 5-characterized by three particles followed or preceded by three antiparticles,
that is, it is created by applying l3 or r3 to the ground state .

as expected from the continuum theory, the pseudoscalar particle mass is smaller than
the scalar particle mass. furthermore, since both quantities are intensive, there is no n

now let us compute the dispersion relation of the pseudoscalar and scalar excitations to

using eqs.(4.80), (4.81) and (4.84), the dispersion relation of the lattice pseudoscalar exci-
tation is given by

e(p) = e(0)

performing a small momentum expansion, one gets

the same procedure yields

the p2 terms are consistent with the bosonic nature of the excitations.

4.2.1 unperturbed energies of the dimer states

in this section the energies of the excitations generated by applying the hopping hamiltonian
hh to the ground state | >, are evaluated. the action of hh on the state | > generates
a dimer-antidimer pair. all the states with one dimer-antidimer pair, and with two dimer-
antidimer pairs (obtained applying hh twice), have the same energy gap with respect to the
ground state. however, not all the states obtained applying (hh)n, with n  3, to | >
have the same energy. there are, for example, two possible energies, corresponding to a gap
of 3 = 3e2

la/4 and 5, for the states with three dimer-antidimer pairs.

the states with a dimer-antidimer pair are given by

|s1
r,l >= hr,l(y)| > .

(4.91)

73

applying on these states the unperturbed hamiltonian one gets

(4.92)

where y must be even if one applies r and must be odd if one applies l. one thus sees that
all the states |s1

r,l > have a mass gap of .

the states with two dimer-antidimer pairs are given by

|s2
(r,l)(r,l) >= hr,l(z)hr,l(y)| >

it is easy to show that all these states have an energy gap of 2.

(4.93)

(4.94)

based on eq.(4.92) and eq.(4.94) one might expect that the states with three dimer-
antidimer pairs have an energy gap of 3. this is actually true for all the states of this
type except for the 2 states with three particles followed or preceeded by three antiparticles.
these states have an energy gap of 5. if one considers the state

|s3
rrr >= r(w)r(z)r(y)| >,

(4.95)

one easily obtains that

to generate a state with three antiparticles followed by three particles, one must have

z = y  2
w = y  1

(4.97)

(4.98)

the energy gap for this state is 5. the same result is obtained for the state |s3
lll >=
l(w)l(z)l(y)| > with z = y + 3 and w = y + 2, which contains three particles followed by
three antiparticles.

the reason for these dierent behaviours, lies on the fact that the commutation relation

between h0 and hh is

[h0, hh] =

if the second term in the r.h.s. was absent, all the states with n dimer-antidimer pairs would
have an energy gap of n.

sion of the mass gap. the six matrix elements that arise in the computation of the second

(4.105)

where m1 and m3 are dened for x and y odd, m2 and m4 for x and y even, m5 for x even
and y odd, and m6 for x odd and y even.

to compute the fourth order energy gap one needs also the matrix elements mi , i =

with the same constraints on x and y as before.

one must then evaluate the twenty matrix elements arising when three hr and three

hl are combined in all possible ways in the expression in the rst line of eq.(4.74)

< (y)|(l  r)(l  r)(r  l)(r  l)|(x) >

since hermiticity of the hamiltonian requires that the elements obtained changing r with

4.3 the chiral condensate

in the continuum schwinger model, the phenomenon of dynamical symmetry breaking of
the chiral symmetry, is due to the anomaly. the order parameter is the mass operator
m (x) = (x)(x) which acquires a non zero vacuum expectation value, giving rise to the
chiral condensate [62]

in this section i compute the lattice chiral condensate to the fourth order in pertur-
bation theory. in the staggered fermion formalism (having put particles on even sites and
antiparticles on odd sites), one has

(x)(x) 

(1)x

the lattice chiral condensate may be obtained by considering the mass operator

(4.127)

where the extra minus sign is there to give the same sign to the lattice and continuum chiral
condensates (see footnote 1 of this chapter), and evaluating the expectation value of (4.128)
on the perturbed states |p > generated by applying hh to | >. one has

|p >= | > +|p1

in this section i want to extract some physics from the lattice results i obtained; to do this,
one should compare the answer of the strong coupling analysis of the lattice theory with the
exact results of the continuum model. for this purpose one should extrapolate the strong
coupling expansion derived under the assumption that the parameter z = t2
la4  1 to the
4e4
region in which z  1; this region corresponds to the continuum theory since e4
la4  0,
z  . to make this extrapolation possible, it is customary [29] to make use of pade
approximants, which allow to extrapolate a series expansion beyond the convergence radius.
strong coupling perturbation theory improved with pade approximants should be compared
with the continuum theory.

as we shall see, the gauge invariant strong coupling expansion here proposed, provides
a very accurate estimate of the observables of the continuum theory, already at the second
order in powers of z. this strongly suggests that, expanding around the gauge, parity and
charge conjugation invariant ground state | >, leads to a perturbative series converging to
the continuum theory faster then the one used in [63, 67].

77

let us rst compute the ratio between the continuum value of the meson mass mc =
ec/ and the lattice coupling constant el, by equating the lattice chiral condensate (4.139),
to its continuum counterpart (4.126)

1

a(cid:18) 1

2  32z + 1536z2(cid:19) =

e
2

mc .

(4.140)

of course, eq.(4.140) is true only when pade approximants are used, since - as it stands -
the l.h.s. holds only for z  1, while the r.h.s. provides the value of the chiral condensate
to be obtained when z  . using the relation
t2
4z

(4.141)

a = (

one gets from (4.140)

1
4

= (

mc
el

4z
t2 )
as in ref.
4 , the fourth power of (4.142) should be considered in
order to construct a non-diagonal pade approximant. since the strong coupling expansion
has been carried out up to second order in z, one is allowed to construct only the [0, 1] pade
approximant for the polynomial written in (4.142). one gets

1
2  32z + 1536z2)

[63], due to the factor z

taking the continuum limit z   one has

t2

(4.143)

(4.144)

next let us compute the same ratio by equating the pseudoscalar mass gap given in (4.78)
to its continuum counterpart mc

e2

la(cid:18) 1

4

+ 8z  576z2(cid:19) = mc .

again eq.(4.145) is true only when pade approximants are used.

dividing both sides of eq.(4.145) by el and taking into account that

one gets

ela = (

t2

1

4

+ 8z  576z2) ,

(4.145)

(4.146)

(4.147)

taking the fourth power, as i did for the chiral condensate equation, and constructing the
[1, 0] pade approximant for the r.h.s. of eq.(4.147) one gets

(

mc
el

)4 =

t2
4z

(

1

256

+

z
2

)

one may now take the limit z  , obtaining
)4 =

(

mc
el

t2
8

.

equating eq.(4.144) and eq.(4.149) one gets an equation for t which gives

t =


8 1
4 e

= 1.049

78

(4.148)

(4.149)

(4.150)

which lies 4.9% above the exact value. it is conforting to see that the lattice theory gives
a light velocity very close to (but greater than ) 1. putting this value of t in eq.(4.144) or
eq.(4.149) one has

= 0.609

(4.151)

mc
el
which lies 7.9% above the exact value 1 .

it is worth to stress that i can reproduce very well the continuum results, even if i use

just rst order (in z) results of the strong coupling perturbation theory.

a second way [63] to extrapolate the polinomial in (4.142) is to equate it to the ratio

(1 + bz)x
(1 + az)x+ 1

4

= 1  64z + 3072z2

so that one can take the limit z   in (4.142). setting t = 1 one gets

mc
el

=

2
e

bx
ax+ 1

4

(4.152)

(4.153)

it is worth to say that this extrapolation works for a large range of values of the parameter
x between 0 and 6 giving an answer that lies between 6.9% below and 10% above the exact
answer. in particular for x = 1 one gets mc
= 0.596 which lies 5.6% above the exact value.
el
for x = 3
= 0.593 wich diers from the continuum value of the 5.1%. for
x = 1
10 one has only 0.7% of error. in the same way one can extrapolate the polinomial in
(4.147)

4 one gets mc

el

(1 + bz)x+ 1
(1 + az)x = 1 + 32z  2304z2

4

so that one can then take the limit z   in (4.147). setting t = 1 one gets

mc
el

=

1
5
4

4

(b)x+ 1

4

1
ax

(4.154)

(4.155)

for x = 1 one gets mc
el
of ref.[63]. for x = 0.5 one has mc
el

= 0.617 which lies 9% above the exact value, against the 30% error

= 0.595 which lies only 5.4% above the exact answer.

in the continuum schwinger model the ratio between the masses of the scalar and the
pseudoscalar particles, ms/mp , equals 2, since ms is the lowest eigenvalue of the continuum
mass spectrum, which starts at 2mp [63]. i shall now evaluate this ratio using the lattice
expression of mp and ms (4.78,4.79). ms/mp is given by
4 + 24z  1600z2
4 + 8z  576z2

ms
mp =

(4.156)

1

1

.

expanding the r.h.s. of (4.156) in power series of z

ms
mp = 1 + 64z  6144z2 ,

one may perform the [1, 1] pade approximant

for z  

ms
mp =

1 + 160z
1 + 96z

.

ms
mp = 1.67

(4.157)

(4.158)

(4.159)

which lies 16% below the continuum value. my result coincides with the one obtained in
[63] at the same order in the perturbative expansion.

79

taking the [1, 1] pade approximants of eq.(4.89) and eq.(4.90) one can compute in an

independent way the ratio between the masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar particles

for z  

ms

in perturbation theory in eq.(4.89) and eq.(4.90) to reproduce better the continuum limit,
since in eq.(4.89) and eq.(4.90) one has no zeroth order term. another test (also suggested

a strong coupling expansion up to the order z4. the agreement of my results with the
continuum theory is very encouraging, since only terms up to the order z2 have been used
in the gauge invariant strong coupling expansion proposed in this paper.

4.5 summary

the investigation, that has been exposed, is aimed at constructing an improved strong cou-
pling expansion for the lattice schwinger model. i showed that, gauge invariance together
with the discrete symmetries of the model, force the ground state to be a neel state. more-
over gauge invariance requires the ground state to have electric elds related to the charge
density operator by the gausss law. thus, for large e2
l, the ground state energy is of order
l rather than 1
e2
[63]; as a consequence, the strong coupling expansion here constructed
e2
l
provides a very accurate extrapolation to the continuum theory already at the second order
in z = t2
la4 . furthermore, the coulomb energy of elementary excitations is also aected,
4e4
since  besides the coulomb self energy  there is also an interaction energy with the charge
of the ground state.

the strongly coupled lattice schwinger model is equivalent to a one-dimensional antifer-
romagnetic ising spin chain with a coulomb long range interaction, which admits the neel
state as an exact ground state. due to this, in my approach, chiral symmetry is broken
spontaneously in the lattice model already at zero-th order in z. i expect that chiral sym-
metry breaking should persist for all coupling, since the critical coupling for d = 1 should
be at e2
l, this behavior is a manifestation of a peierls
instability  the tendency of a one dimensional fermi gas to form a gap at the fermi surface.
this happens with any innitesimal interaction.

l = 0. i conjecture that, for small e2

80

in the continuum theory the schwinger model exhibits the nambu-goldstone phenomenon:

global chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, but no goldstone boson appears in the spec-
trum since the local current is anomalous [66]. on the lattice there is no anomaly due to
the nielsen-ninomiya theorem [27].

the present analysis shows that in the strong coupling limit, chiral symmetry is sponta-
neously broken at all orders, since the states | > and | > mix only at a perturbative order
comparable with the volume of the system. being chiral symmetry replaced by the discrete
symmetry representing invariance under tranlations by one lattice site, eects related to the
breaking of the chiral symmetry on the lattice should come from the coupling between the
two sublattices. this is manifest in my strong coupling calculations.

the two-avor lattice schwinger
model

in this chapter i study the su (2)-avor lattice schwinger model in the hamiltonian formal-
ism using staggered fermions. the existence of the continuum internal isospin symmetry
makes the model much more interesting than the one-avor case; the spectrum is extremely
reacher, exhibiting also massless excitations and the chiral symmetry breaking pattern is
completely dierent from the one-avor case. i shall demonstrate [39, 40] that the strong
coupling limit of the two-avor lattice schwinger model is mapped onto an interesting quan-
tum spin model  the one-dimensional spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet. the
ground state of the antiferromagnetic chain has been known since many years [36] and its
energy was computed in [37]; the complete spectrum as been determined by faddeev and
takhtadzhyan [30] using the algebraic bethe ansatz.

the two-avor lattice schwinger model with non-zero fermion mass m has been analysed
in [70] in the limit of heavy fermions m  e2; good agreement with the continuum theory
has been found.

there are by now many hints at a correspondence between quantized gauge theories
and quantum spin models, aimed at analyzing new phases relevant for condensed matter
systems [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. recently laughlin has argued that there is an analogy between
the spectral data of gauge theories and strongly correlated electron systems [25]. moreover,
certain spin ladders have been shown to be related to the two-avor schwinger model [71].

the correspondence between the su(2) avor schwinger model and the quantum heisen-
berg antiferromagnetic chain provides a concrete computational scheme in which the issue
of the correspondence between quantized gauge theories and quantum spin models may be
investigated. because of dimensionality of the coupling constant in (1+1)-dimensions the
infrared behavior is governed by the strong coupling limit, and it is tempting to conjecture
the existence of an exact correspondence between the infrared limits of the heisenberg and
two-avor schwinger models. i shall derive [39, 40] results which support this conjecture.
for example the gapless modes in the spectra have identical quantum numbers; within the
accurancy of the strong coupling limit, the gapped mode of the two-avor schwinger model
was also identied in the spectrum of the heisenberg model.

in this chapter i present a complete study [40] of the strong coupling limit of the two-
avor lattice schwinger model. i rstly compute explicitly the masses of the excitations to
the second order in the strong coupling expansion; this computation needs the knowledge of

82

the spin-spin correlators of the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain. the continuum

massless two-avor schwinger model does exhibit neither an isoscalar(cid:10) (cid:11) nor an isovector
(cid:10) a(cid:11) chiral condensate, since this is forbidden by the coleman theorem [43]. on the

lattice i show that these fermion condensates are zero to all the orders in the strong coupling
r > and
expansion. moreover i nd that the pertinent chiral condensate is < 
i compute its lattice expression up to the second order in the strong coupling expansion. it
should be noticed that, in abscence of gauge elds, the chiral condensate is zero, is dierent
from zero only when the fermions are coupled to gauge elds. this can be viewed as the
manifestation of the chiral anomaly in this model. i nally compare the lattice results with
the ones of the continuum theory.

the theory has an internal sul(2)  sur(2)-avor isospin symmetry; the dirac elds are
an isodoublet whereas the electromagnetic eld is an isosinglet. it is well known that in
1 + 1 dimensions there is no spontaneous breakdown of continuous internal symmetries,
unless there are anomalies or the higgs phenomenon occurs. neither mechanism is possible
in the two-avor schwinger model for the sul(2)  sur(2)-symmetry: isovector currents
do not develop anomalies and there are no gauge elds coupled to the isospin currents. the
particles belong then to isospin multiplets. for what concerns the u (1) gauge symmetry
there is an higgs phenomenon [66].

it is well known that at the quantum level the vector and axial currents cannot be simul-
taneously conserved, due to the anomaly phenomenon [26]. if the regularization is gauge

83

invariant, so that the vector current is conserved, then the axial current acquires the anomaly
which breaks the ua(1)-symmetry

the isoscalar and isovector chiral condensates are zero due to the coleman theorem [43]; in
fact, they would break not only the ua(1) symmetry of the action, but also the continuum
internal symmetry sul(2)sur(2) down to suv (2). there is, however, a sul(2)sur(2)
invariant operator, which is non-invariant under the ua(1)-symmetry; it can acquire a non-
vanishing vev without violating colemans theorem and consequently may be regarded as
a good order parameter for the ua(1)-breaking. its expectation value is given by [72, 62]

it describes a process in which two right movers are anihilated and two left movers are
created. note that f , being quadrilinear in the elds, is actually invariant under chiral
rotations of /2, namely under the discrete axial symmetry

a(x)  5a(x)

a(x)   a(x)5 .

(5.14)

as a consequence, this part of the chiral symmetry group is not broken by the non-vanishing
vev of f (5.13).

as we shall see in section (5.4), the lattice theory faithfully reproduces the pattern of
symmetry breaking of the continuum theory; this happens even if on the lattice the su (2)-
avor symmetry is not protected by the coleman theorem. the isoscalar and isovector
chiral condensates are zero also on the lattice, whereas the operator f acquires a non-
vanishing vev due to the coupling of left and right movers induced by the gauge eld. the
continuous axial symmetry is broken explicitly by the staggered fermion, but the discrete
axial symmetry (5.14) remains.

with [73].

in the massive su (2) schwinger model  when the mass of the fermion m is small
compared to e2 (strong coupling)  coleman [73] showed that - in addition to the triplet
 (i p g = 1+) the low-energy spectrum exhibits a singlet i p g = 0++ lying on top of the
triplet . in this limit the gauge theory is mapped to a sine-gordon model and the low
lying excitations are soliton-antisoliton states. when m  0, these soliton-antisoliton states
become massless [76]; in this limit, the analysis of the many body wave functions, carried out
in ref.[76], hints to the existence of a whole class of massless states with positive g-parity;
p-parity however cannot be determined with the procedure developed in [76]. these are not
the only excitations of the model: way up in mass there is the isosinglet i p g = 0, (+),
already discussed in ref. [73]. the model exhibits also triplets, whose mass  of order ms
or greater  stays nite [76]; among the triplets there is a g-even state 1.

i shall consider the strong coupling perturbative expansion where the coulomb hamil-
tonian (5.37) is the unperturbed hamiltonian and the hopping hamiltonian (5.38) the per-
turbation. due to eq.(5.34) every conguration with one particle per site has zero energy,
so that the ground state of the coulomb hamiltonian (5.37) is 2n times degenerate. the
degeneracy of the ground state can be removed only at the second perturbative order since
the rst order is trivially zero.

at the second order the lattice gauge theory is eectively described by the antiferromag-

netic heisenberg hamiltonian. the vacuum energy  at order 2  reads

the ground state of hj singles out the correct vacuum, on which to perform the perturbative

there exist two kinds of excitations created from |g.s. >; one kind involves only spin
ipping and has lower energy since no electric ux is created, the other involves fermion
transport besides spin ipping and thus has a higher energy. for the latter excitations
the energy is proportional to the coupling times the length of the electric ux: the lowest
energy is achieved when the fermion is transported by one lattice spacing. of course only
the excitations of the rst kind can be mapped into states of the heisenberg model.

in [30] the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model excitations have been classied. there it
was shown that any excitation may be regarded as the scattering state of quasiparticles of
spin-1/2: every physical state contains an even number of quasiparticles and the spectrum
exhibits only integer spin states. the two simplest excitations of lowest energy in the ther-
modynamic limit are a triplet and a singlet [30]; they have a dispersion relation depending
on the momenta of the two quasiparticles. for vanishing total momentum (relative to the
ground state momentum pg.s. = 0 for n

limit they are degenerate with the ground state.

in chapter 3 i showed that even for nite size systems, the excited states can be grouped in
families corresponding to the classication given in [30]. i explicitly exhibited all the energy
eigenstates for n = 4 and n = 6. the lowest lying are a triplet and a singlet, respectively;
they have a well dened relative (to the ground state) p -parity and g-parity - 1+ for the
triplet and 0++ for the singlet. since they share the same quantum numbers these states can
be identied, in the limit of vanishing fermion mass, with the soliton-antisoliton excitations
found by coleman in his analysis of the two-avor schwinger model. a related analysis
about the parity of the lowest lying states in nite size heisenberg chains, has been given
in [77].

88

moreover in [30] a whole class  maf  of gapless excitations at zero momentum was
singled out in the thermodynamic limit; these states are eigenstates of the total momentum
and consequently have positive g-parity at zero momentum. the low lying states of the
schwinger model also contain [76] many massless excitations with positive g-parity; they
are identied [39, 40] with the excitations belonging to maf . the mass of these states in
the schwinger model can be obtained from the dierences between the excitation energies
at zero momentum and the ground state energy. the energies of the states |ex. > belonging
to the class maf have the same perturbative expansion of the ground state. consequently,
the states |ex. > at zero momentum up to the second order in the strong coupling expansion
have the same energy of the ground state (5.41), e(2)
ex = 4n ln 2. to this order the mass
gap is zero. higher order corrections may give a mass gap.

5.2.1 the low lying spectrum of qcd2

in section (2.3.2) i already explained that qcd2 with colour group su (2) and 1 avor is
also mapped onto the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain. this result
was originally found by langmann and semeno in [24]. it is worth stressing this fact here,
and speculating about the model spectrum.

i claim that the massless excitation spectrum of this non-abelian theory in the strong
coupling limit is the same of the massless excitation spectrum of the two-avor massless
schwinger model. both the models exhibit an exact correspondence with the infrared limit
of the heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain.

the quark-like excitations of qcd2 are gapless spin-1/2 kinks or spinons. they always
appear in even number so that the only physical excitations have integer spin and an even
number of spinons. this phenomenon is not exactly what one would call connement. these
quark-spinons are localizable objects and one can consider their scattering. there are no
bound states of spinons in the spin-1/2 quantum antiferromagnetic chain [30]. spinons exist
only in even number and this constraint is the spin model counterpart of the abscence of
coloured states in qcd2. one avor qcd2 exhibits only mesons in its spectrum and it
is not possible to generate baryons. i can say nothing, at this level of analysis, about the
massive excitations of lattice qcd2 which are created by the non abelian currents of the
model acting on |g.s. >. these currents involve charge transport on |g.s. > and create
electric ux. the non zero electric ux generates the masses of the excitations, with a
mechanism similar to that of the two-avor schwinger model.

5.3 the meson masses

in this section i determine the masses for the states obtained by fermion transport of one
site on the heisenberg model ground state. my analysis shows that besides the g-odd

pseudoscalar isosinglet 0 with mass ms = elp2/, there are also a g-even pseudoscalar

isotriplet 1+ and a g-odd scalar isotriplet 1+ with masses of the order of ms or greater.
the quantum numbers are relative to those of the ground state i p g
g.s. = 0++ for n/2 even
g.s. = 0 for n/2 odd.
i p g

two states can be created using the spatial component of the vector j1(x) eq.(5.10) and
isovector j1
(x) eqs.(5.8,5.9) schwinger model currents. they are the g-odd pseudoscalar
isosinglet i p g = 0 and the g-even pseudoscalar isotriplet i p g = 1+. the lattice
operators with the correct quantum numbers creating these states at zero momentum, when

(5.62)

one immediately recognizes that the excitation spectrum is determined once < g.s.|~sx 
~sx+2|g.s. > is known. equations similar to eq.(5.62) may be established also at a generic
order of the strong coupling expansion.

at the zeroth perturbative order the pseudoscalar triplet is degenerate with the isosinglet
s = 1. following the same procedure as before one may compute the energy of

n + < g.s.|hj|g.s. >

.

(5.64)

(5.65)

the vev of each squared component of ~v on the rotationally invariant singlet |g.s. > give
the same contribution i.e. ds(t) = ds(t0): the triplet states (as in the continuum
theory) have a degenerate mass gap. this is easily veried by direct computation on nite
size systems; when the size of the system is nite one may also show that ds is of zeroth
order in n.

the excitation masses are given by ms = e2
la

2 (es  eg.s.) and mt = e2
la
2 (et  eg.s.).
consequently, the (n -dependent) ground state energy terms appearing in e(2)
s and e(2)
t can-
cel and what is left are only n independent terms. this is a good check of our computation,
being the mass an intensive quantity.

in principle one should expect also excitations created acting on |g.s. > with the chiral
currents, in analogy with the one avor schwinger model where, as shown in ref. [63], the
chiral current creates a two-meson bound state. the chiral currents operators for the two
avor schwinger model are given by

following the computational scheme used to study |s > and |t >, one nds that the
state |s5 > is not a particle-like excitation since its energy depends on the volume of the
system and this would lead to an extensive mass; consequently, there is no 0++ massive
singlet in agreement with [73]. for the triplet |t 5 > one gets

now i can compute the mass spectrum up to the second order in the strong coupling

the existence of massive isotriplets was already noticed in [76], and their mass in the
continuum theory was numerically computed for various values of the fermion mass.
in
particular there is a g-parity even isotriplet with mass approximately equal to the mass of
the isosinglet 0.

the mass of the |t5 > isotriplet is

equations (5.80), (5.82) and (5.83) provide the values of ms, mt and mt 5 for small
values of z = 2 = t2
la4 up to the second order in the strong coupling expansion. whereas
e4
(5.82) is only approximate (5.80) and (5.83) are exact at the second order in the  expansion.
in section (5.5) i shall extrapolate these masses to the continuum limit using the standard
technique of the pade approximants.

5.4 chiral condensate

in the following i shall rst prove that also on the lattice either the isoscalar (cid:10) (cid:11) or the
isovector (cid:10) a(cid:11) chiral condensates are zero to every order of perturbation theory. this
should be veried by explicit computation since on the lattice the symmetry sul(2)sur(2)
is already broken by introducing staggered fermions; thus, there is no symmetry to prevent
the formation of such chiral condensates. in the continuum theory, instead, the breaking of
the sul(2)  sur(2) down to suv (2) is prevented by the coleman theorem [43].

in the staggered fermion formalism the isoscalar condensate is given by

a(x)a(x) 

(1)x

(1,x1,x + 2,x2,x  1)

and evaluating its expectation value on the perturbed states |pg.s. > generated by applying
hh to |g.s. >. to the second order in the strong coupling expansion, one has

a nonvanishing value of the lattice chiral condensate is due to the coupling  induced by
the lattice gauge eld  between the right and left fermions. this is the relic in the lattice
of the ua(1) anomaly in the continuum theory.

5.5 lattice versus continuum

i now want to compare our lattice results with the exact results of the continuum model; to
do this, one should extrapolate the strong-coupling expansion derived under the assumption
that the parameter z = 2 = t2
la4  1 to the region in which z  1; this corresponds to take
e4
la4  0 when z  . to make the extrapolation possible,
the continuum limit since e4
it is customary to make use of pade approximants, which allow to extrapolate a series
expansion beyond the convergence radius. strong-coupling perturbation theory improved
by pade approximants should then provide results consistent with the continuum theory.

94

as we shall see the strong-coupling expansion derived in this chapter provides accurate
estimates of the meson masses, already at the rst order in powers of z.

let us now evaluate ms and the lattice light velocity t. i rst compute the ratio between
 ec and the lattice coupling constant el by

the continuum value of the meson mass ms =q 2

equating the lattice chiral condensate, eq.(5.107), to its continuum counterpart eq.(5.99)

eq.(5.108) is true only when pade approximants are used since, as it stands, the left hand side
holds only for z  1, while the right-hand side provides the value of the chiral condensate
to be obtained when z = . using

as in refs.[63, 61], due to the factor z
2 , the second power of eq.(5.110) should be considered
in order to construct a non diagonal pade approximant. since the strong coupling expansion
has been carried out up to second order in z, one is allowed to construct only the [0, 1] pade
approximant for the polynomial written in eq.(5.110). one gets

the discrepancy between eq.(5.120) and eq.(5.121) is mainly due to the approximation

lattice computation implies the existence of a massive isotriplet 1+ with a mass between
the lower bound (5.120) and the upper bound (5.121). this is in agreement with the results
provided for the continuum theory in [76].

this triplet, being g-odd, is a scattering state of a 0 singlet with a 1+ triplet, which are

the triplet mass is reproduced with lesser accuracy due to the random phase approximation
used in the computation of the pertinent correlator; a better answer is given however by a
direct computation on the 8 sites chain yielding the value 1.2346 for mt /el.

5.6 summary

in this chapter i used the correspondence between the two-avor strongly coupled lattice
schwinger model and the antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian [39, 40] to investigate

96

the spectrum of the gauge model. using the analysis of the excitations of the nite size
chains given in the chapter 3, i showed the equality of the quantum numbers of the states
of the heisenberg model and the low lying excitations of the two-avor schwinger model. i
provided also the spectrum of the massive excitations of the gauge model; in order to extract
numerical values for the masses, i explicitly computed the pertinent spin-spin correlators
of the heisenberg chain in chapter 3. although the spectrum is determined only up to the
second order in the strong coupling expansion the agreement with the continuum theory is
satisfactory.

the massless and the massive excitations of the gauge model are created from the spin
chain ground state with two very dierent mechanisms: massless excitations involve only spin
ipping while massive excitations are created by fermion transport besides spin ipping and
do not belong to the spin chain spectrum. as in the continuum theory, due to the coleman
theorem [73], the massless excitations are not goldstone bosons, but may be regarded as
the gapless quantum excitations of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain [48].

in computing the chiral condensate i showed that, also in the lattice theory, the ex-
pectation value of the umklapp operator f is dierent from zero, while both <  > and
< a > are zero to every order in the strong coupling expansion. this implies that
both on the lattice and the continuum the su (2) avor symmetry is preserved whereas the
ua(1) axial symmetry is broken. the umklapp operator f is the order parameter for this
symmetry, but being quadri-linear in the fermi elds, is invariant, in the continuum, under
chiral rotation of /2 and on the lattice under the corresponding discrete axial symmetry
(5.30) (translation by one lattice site). this shows that the discrete axial symmetry is not
broken in both cases. our lattice computation enhance this result since the ground state of
the strongly coupled two-avor schwinger model is translationally invariant.

the pattern of symmetry breaking of the continuum is exactly reproduced even if the
coleman theorem does not apply on the lattice and the anomalous symmetry breaking is
impossible due to the nielsen-ninomiya [27] theorem. at variance with the strongly coupled
one-avor lattice schwinger model, the anomaly is not realized in the lattice theory via the
spontaneous breaking of a residual chiral symmetry [61], but, rather, by explicit breaking
of the chiral symmetry due to staggered fermions. the non-vanishing of < f > may be
regarded as the only relic, in the strongly coupled lattice theory, of the anomaly of the
continuum two-avor schwinger model. it is due to the coupling induced by the gauge eld,
between the right and left-movers on the lattice.

chapter 6

the multiavor lattice
schwinger models

in this chapter i study the n -avor lattice schwinger models in the hamiltonian formalism
using staggered fermions. i illustrated in chapter 5 how the presence of a nontrivial su (2)-
avor symmetry makes the spectrum much richer than the one-avor model spectrum and
changes drastically the chiral symmetry breaking pattern.

the n -avor schwinger models have many features in in common with four dimensional
qcd: at the classical level they have a symmetry group ul(n )  ur(n ) = sul(n ) 
sur(n )  uv (1)  ua(1) that is broken down to sul(n )  sur(n )  uv (1) by the
axial anomaly exactly like in qcd [78]. the massless n -avor schwinger models describe
no real interactions between their particles as one can infer by writing the model action
in a bosonized form. the model exhibits one massive and n 2  1 massless pseudoscalar
mesons [79].

on the lattice i shall prove that  at the second order in the strong coupling expansion 
the lattice schwinger models are eectively described by su (n ) quantum antiferromagnetic
spin-1/2 heisenberg hamiltonians with spins in a particular fundamental representation of
the su (n ) lie algebra and with nearest neighbours couplings. the features of the model
are very dierent depending on if n is odd or even. when n is odd, the ground state energy
in the strong coupling limit is proportional to e2
l, the square of the electromagnetic coupling
constant. in contrast, when n is even the ground state energy in the strong coupling limit
is of order 1. this dierence arises from the proper denition of the charge density

(x) =

a,xa,x  n

2

n

xa=1

(6.1)

where the constant n /2 has been subtracted from the charge density operator in order
to make it odd under the charge conjugation transformation. as a consequence, when n
is even, (x) admits zero eigenvalues and the ground state does not support any electric
ux, while when n is odd the ground state exhibits a staggered conguration of the charge
density and electromagnetic uxes.

in the continuum the coleman theorem [43] prevents the formation of either an isoscalar
chiral condensate <  > or an isovector chiral condensate < t a >  where t a is an
su (n ) generator  for every model with an internal su (n )-avor symmetry. we shall see
that this feature should be reproduced on the lattice also for this class of models.

where the n fermions have been introduced in a completely symmetric way. although the
theory described by (6.2) strictly parallels what has been shown in chapter 5 for the su (2)
model, i shall now report a detailed analysis both for the sake of clarity and to show that
some dierence appears between n even and odd.

the dirac elds are an n -plet, i.e. transform according to the fundamental represen-
tation of the avor group while the electromagnetic eld is an su (n ) singlet. the avor
symmetry of the theory cannot be spontaneously broken for the same reasons as in the su (2)
case. the particles of the theory belong to su (n ) multiplets. the action is invariant under
the symmetry

.

(6.8)

at the classical level the above symmetries lead to conservation laws for the isovector, vector
and axial currents

j
(x)r = a(x)pr(t)abb(x)
j
(x)l = a(x)pl(t)abb(x)

(6.10)
(6.11)

(6.12)

at the quantum level the vector and axial currents cannot be simultaneously conserved. if
the regularization is gauge invariant, so that the vector current is conserved, then the axial
current acquires the anomaly which breaks the symmetry ua(1) [78]

the isoscalar <  > and isovector < t  > chiral condensates are zero due to the
coleman theorem [43], in fact they would break not only the ua(1) symmetry of the action
but also the continuum internal symmetry sul(n )  sur(n ) down to suv (n ). there is
an order parameter just for the breaking of the ua(1) symmetry [62, 72], the operator

the umklapp operator is even under (6.15) when n is even and this implies that notwith-
standing the fact that the continuous chiral rotations ua(1) are broken by the non-zero vev
(6.14), the discrete chiral symmetry (6.15) is unbroken. when n is odd also the discrete
chiral symmetry (6.15) is broken by the non-zero vev (6.14).

the usual abelian bosonization procedure may again be applied provided that n bose

the mass matrix is determined by the last term in eq.(6.19) and must be diagonalized. the
eld degrees of freedom span the vector space on which the mass matrix is dened. the
action must be expressed in terms of an orthonormal basis of eld vectors, in order to have a
properly normalised kinetic energy term. the original a in eq.(6.19) are orthonormal basis
vectors, but they are not eigenvectors of the mass matrix. the mass matrix has one non-

excitations appears in a more symmetrical form [75].

the fermion elds are dened on the sites, x = 1, . . . , n , gauge and the electric elds, ax
and ex, on the links [x; x + 1], n is an even integer and, when n is nite it is convenient to
impose periodic boundary conditions. when n is nite, the continuum limit is the n -avor
schwinger model on a circle [68]. the coecient t of the hopping term in (6.29) plays the
role of the lattice light speed. in the naive continuum limit, el = ec and t = 1.

the lattice n -avor schwinger model is equivalent to a one dimensional quantum coulomb
gas on the lattice with n kinds of particles. to see this one can x the gauge, ax = a
(coulomb gauge). eliminating the non-constant electric eld and using the gauge constraint,
one obtains the eective hamiltonian

(6.36)

it is easy to understand that (x) = 0 on every site in the ground state by observing that
the coulomb hamiltonian (6.32) is a non-negative operator and that the states with zero
|g.s. > is an highly degenerate state; in fact
charge density are zero eigenvalues of (6.32).

the state (6.37) is antisymmetric in the indices a = 1, . . . , n2 ; i.e. it takes on any orientation
of the vector in the representation of the avor symmetry group su (n ) with young tableau
given in g.(6.1). the energy of |g.s. > is of order 1, since it is non zero only at the second

(6.48)

the problem of determining the correct ground state, on which to perform the perturbative
expansion, is then reduced again to the diagonalization of the su (n ) heisenberg spin-1/2
hamiltonian (6.45). as i already pointed out in chapter 3, generalized su (n ) antiferro-
magnetic chains have not been yet analysed in the literature in such a detailed way as the
su (2) chains. consequentely, the study of the lattice su (n ) avor lattice schwinger mod-
els become extremely complicated for n > 2. nonetheless, the computational scheme that
i developed for the u (1)- and su (2)-avor models in chapters 4 and 5, should work for a
generic su (n )-avor model.

the ground state of the gauge models is very dierent when n is even or n is odd. when
n is even, the ground state |g.s. > of the spin hamiltonian (6.45) is non-degenerate and
translationally invariant, and since it is the ground state of the gauge model in the innite
coupling limit, there is no spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry for any su (2n )-
avor lattice schwinger model. in contrast, when n is odd, the ground state |g.s. > of the
spin hamiltonian (6.45) is degenerate of order two and is not translationally invariant and
consequently any su (2n +1)-avor lattice schwinger model exhibits spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the discrete axial symmetry. by translating of one lattice spacing |g.s. > one
gets the other one. the n -avor lattice schwinger models excitations are also generated from
|g.s. > by two very dierent mechanisms, that i already described for the two-avor model
in chapter 5. there are excitations involving only avor changes of the fermions without
changing the charge density (x) which corrispond to spin ips in the su (2) invariant model.
these excitations are massless. at variance massive excitations involve fermion transport
besides avor changes and are created by applying to |g.s. > the latticized currents of the
schwinger models which vary the on site value of (x).

very dierent is the case of the massive multiavor schwinger models [81]. when n is
odd, the presence of a non-zero fermionic mass m removes the degeneracy and selects one
of the two |g.s. > as the non degenerate ground state. when n is even the ground state
remains translationally invariant in the strong coupling limit e2

limit m  e2

summary and conclusions

in this thesis i showed explicitly that the strong coupling limit of the multiavor lattice
schwinger models is eectively described by quantum spin-1/2 generalized su (n ) antifer-
romagnetic heisenberg chains. exploiting the mapping existing between these gauge and
spin models, exact results about antiferromagnetic chains have been used to analyse the chi-
ral symmetry breaking on the lattice. in particular an interesting question has been how the
eects of the axial anomaly appear in the lattice regularization. since [27] fermion theories
on a lattice have an equal number of species of left- and right-handed weyl particles in the
continuum limit, there is no axial anomaly in a lattice theory.

i studied in detail the u (1)-avor and su (2)-avor models, archetypes for all su (2n +
1) and su (2n ) models. the results are very dierent depending on if the number of
avors is even or odd. the su (2n )-avor schwinger models exhibit non-degenerate and
translationally invariant ground states in the strong coupling limit and their energy is of
order 1. at variance, the su (2n + 1) models have two degenerate ground states, break the
symmetry of translation by one lattice spacing and their energy is of order e2
l. the dierence
between n even and odd arises, since, also on the lattice, the charge density operator must
be odd under charge conjugation; therefore the constant n /2 should be subtracted from
the charge density operator (6.1). as a consequence, when the n is odd, the ground state
supports electric uxes while this becomes impossible when n is even.

in the one-avor model i proved that the discrete axial symmetry is spontaneously bro-
ken on the lattice, reproducing the eects due to the axial anomaly in the continuum. in
the innite coupling limit the ground state of the gauge model is the ground state of an an-
tiferromagnetic ising chain with long range spin-spin coulomb interactions. the schwinger
model excitations are created by acting on the ground state with the latticized currents.
the excitation masses are determined in the strong coupling expansion by computing the
excitation energies up to the fourth order in the strong coupling expansion. using suitable
pade approximants, i extrapolated to the continuum the lattice results and i found that the
lattice answers are in very good agreement with the continuum theory.

in the two-avor schwinger model, i demonstrated that in the strong coupling limit the
gauge model is eectively described by the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamilto-
nian and the ground state of the gauge model in the innite coupling limit is the ground
state of the spin chain. since the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model is exactly solvable
in one-dimension, it is very interesting to exhibit a gauge theory with the same low lying
excitation spectrum.

the antiferromagnetic spin chain admits spin-1/2 quarklike spinon excitations but has
physical states with integer spin and an even number of spinons. spinons behave like u (1)

105

quarks and they can be identied in conventional materials and models by high-energy
spectroscopy and inconsistences in sum rules [25]. the two-avor schwinger model strictly
parallels this scenario. the fundamental particles are spin-1/2 fermions but the spectrum
exhibits only integer spin bosonic excitations [28]. i proved that the spinons have the same
quantum numbers of the gauge model excitations. while spinons are the gapless excitations
created from the spin chain ground state by spin ipping, the massive excitations of the
gauge model are created from the spin chain ground state by fermion transport besides spin
ipping and do not belong to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg spectrum. the lattice mass
spectrum, properly extrapolated to the continuum by using pade approximants, reproduces
in a satisfactory way the continuum results. the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking of the
continuum model is exactly reproduced on the lattice, even if the coleman theorem does not
apply and the anomalous symmetry breaking is impossible [27]. in fact, both the isoscalar
<  > and the isovector < a > chiral condensates are zero to every order in the strong
coupling expansion, while the expectation value of the umklapp operator f is dierent from
zero.

the multiavor schwinger models are the gauge theories associated to the quantum spin-
1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains. it would be interesting to extend my analysis to
qcd2 with dierent avor and color groups. the number of colors nc determines the
representation of the antiferromagnetic chain, since the spin is s = nc /2. varying nc one
changes the spin s. in particular, by considering the su (2)-avor case, i.e. qcd2 with two
kinds of quarks, one nds that in the strong coupling limit the gauge model is eectively
described by the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with spin-s representation. since half-
integer spin chains are expected to exhibit gapless excitations, while integer spin chains
have a gap [48], it would be an interesting problem to investigate if also qcd2 exhibits a
gapless or gapped spectrum depending on if nc is odd or even. two dimensional qcd
aords an excellent opportunity to study various dynamical questions of gauge theories,
since many of its qualitative features are also valid in four dimensions. qcd2 still resists
analytic solutions for general su (nc ) colour groups, except in the planar limit nc 
 [82, 83]. in fact, t hooft [82] analysed the qcd2 spectrum in the continuum exploiting
a perturbation expansion with respect to 1/nc and showed that the nc   limit, keeping
gnc constant (g is the strong interactions coupling constant), corresponds to taking only
the planar feynman diagrams with no fermion loops [83]. the nc   limit of two avor
qcd2 should be compared with the s   of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain. the
study of the spin chain in the large s limit can be performed using the spin-wave theory
and it would be fascinating to single out gluon and hadron degrees of freedom in the
antiferromagnetic chain.

pade approximants

for the sake of clarity and to make the thesis self-contained, i dene here what are pade
approximants [29, 84]. although the method of pade approximant has a long history, dating
back more than one century, it is only in the 1960s that the procedure has become a part
of the bag of tricks of the working physicist [29]. when a power series representation of
a function diverges, it indicates the presence of singularities. the divergence of the series
reects the inability of a polynomial to approximate a function adeguately near a singularity.
the basic idea of summation theory is to represent f (z), the function in question, by a
convergent expression. in euler summation this expression is the limit of a convergent series,
while in borel summation this expression is the limit of a convergent integral. the diculty
with euler and borel summation is that all of the terms of the divergent series must be
known exactly before the sum can be found even approximately. in realistic perturbation
problems only a few terms of a perturbative series can be calculated as we have seen in
chapters 4 and 5. therefore, it is needed a summation algorithm, which requires as input
only a nite number of terms of the divergent series. the pade summation is a method
having such a property.

the idea of pade summation is to replace a power series such aspn=0 anzn by a sequence

of rational functions of the form

(6.49)

p n

m (z) = pn
pm

n=0 anzn
n=0 bnzn

where one can choose b0 = 1 without loss of generality. as it stands from eq.(6.49) p n
m (z)
is the ratio of a polynomial of degree n and one of degree m . the m + n + 1 coecients
a0, a1, . . . , an, b1, b2, . . . , bm are determined in such a way that the rst m + n + 1 terms
in the taylor series expansion of p n
m (z) match the rst m + n + 1 terms of the power series
m (z) are called pade approximants. constructing pade

approximants p n
a function f (z), then in many instances p n
is a divergent series. the sequence of pade approximants (6.49) with m = n is called the
diagonal sequence. let us sketch the computation of p 0
1 (z) in a
taylor series

m (z) is very useful; in fact, if pn=0 anzn is a power series representation of
m (z)  f (z) as m, n  , even if pn=0 anzn

1 (z). one has to expand p 0

pn=0 anzn. the rational functions p n

p 0

1 (z) =

a0

1 + b1z

= a0  a0b1z + o(z2)

(z  0)

(6.50)

and comparing the series (6.50) with the rst two terms in the power series representation

of f (z) =pn=0 anzn one gets two equations: a0 = a0, a1 = a0b1 from which

(6.51)

p 0

1 =

a0
1  a1

a0

z

as it clear from this very simple example, to construct a pade approximant p n
m (z) one does
not need the full power series representation of a function, but just the rst m +n +1 terms.

107

since pade approximant involve only algebraic operations, they are more convenient for
computational purposes than borel summation, which requires one to integrate on an innite
range the analytic continuation of a function dened by a power series. pade approximants
often work quite well, even beyond their proven range of applicability. for an analysis of
the convergence theory of pade approximants, see ref. [84].
