abstract

in the generalized legendre transform construction the kahler potential is re-
lated to a particular function. here, the form of this function appropriate to the
k-monopole metric is calculated from the known twistor theory of monopoles.

1 introduction

monopole moduli spaces are hyperkahler and, therefore, have a twistor description.
such a description is given in [1]. more recently, ivanov and rocek used the generalized
legendre transform of [16] to construct the metric on the 2-monopole moduli space [15].
the relationship between these two twistor constructions is claried in this paper.

the twistor space of a hyperkahler manifold, m, is a trivial ber bundle, z = m p1,
with a holomorphic symplectic form , which is an o(2) section over p1. p1 is covered
by two ane patches, u0 and u1. if  is the usual projective coordinate on u0, then  is
given on the ber over  by  = (2 + i3) + 21   2(2  i3) where 1, 2 and 3 are
the covariantly constant 2-forms which hyperkahlerity implies exist on m.

the generalized legendre transform construction shows how the kahler potential
may be calculated, if  is assumed to have a certain form.
in subsection 1.1 of this
introductory section, there is a brief review of this construction. this is followed, in
subsection 1.2, by a brief review of the twistor theory of monopoles and the related
twistor theory of monopole moduli spaces. in section 2, this twistor theory is re-expressed
as a generalized legendre transform. the legendre transform constraints are then the
ercolani-sinha conditions [7, 12].

1.1 twistors and the generalized legendre transform

the generalized legendre transform construction of [11, 16, 15] concerns twistor
spaces with k intermediate holomorphic projections z  o(2nj)  p1, where j = 1 . . . k
and nj are integers. in the example of interest in this paper nj = j and for ease of notation

1

attention is restricted to that case. this requirement is equivalent to the existence of k
coordinates j() on z, so that j() is a degree 2j polynomial:

j =

wj

a a,

2j

xa=1

(1)

satisfying the reality condition j() = (1)j 2jj(1/).

the construction is derived from the patching formulae relating quantities over u0
and u1. the coordinate on u1 is given by  = 1/. since  is an o(2) line bundle, it is
given on u1 by , where

 =

1
 2 

on u0  u1. similarly, the j coordinates are related by

j =

1
 2j j.

this means that, if (j, j, ) are coordinates for the whole of z, such that

 =

k

xj=1

dj  dj,

then, the patching formula for j must be

j =  2j2(cid:18)j +

h

j(cid:19)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

for some function h(j).

the expansion of these coordinates as power series is now considered. the patching
formulae will place constraints on the values of certain coecients in these expansions
and these constraints will be unied as constraints on a single function f . by expanding
the symplectic form in , it is possible to calculate the kahler potential for the metric on
m in terms of f .

assuming that j is non-singular near  = 0;

j =

j =

using the residue theorem and the patching formula (5), this means that

where 0 is the small contour surrounding  = 0. the integral of j does not give the
coecient yj
it is
assumed that the contribution from these cuts can be expressed as an integral of some
new function, h , around some contour, c. this integral is the eect of moving the contour
of the j integral from a small contour around zero to a small contour around innity. this
technique is justied by example and is dealt with carefully in the specic case considered
below. thus,

1.2 twistors and monopoles

the twistor theory of monopoles is described in [9, 10]. a k-monopole is equivalent

to a curve, s, in t p1 of the form

p (, ) = k +

j kj = 0

k

xj=1

3

(14)

where j is, as before, a degree 2j polynomial satisfying the reality condition.  is the
usual coordinate on the ber of t p1  p1. s is called the spectral curve. in addition to
the reality condition on j, it must also satisfy a number of algebraic-geometric conditions.
in particular it is required that the l2 bundle over the spectral curve must be trivial.

the patches u0 and u1 on p1 lift to patches on t p1. these, in turn, give patches
on the spectral curve: these will also be called u0 and u1. the triviality of the l2 bundle
over the spectral curve, means that there is a section given by two nowhere vanishing
holomorphic functions f0 on u0 and f1 on u1 satisfying

f0(, ) = e

2

 f1(, )

(15)

on the intersection u0  u1.

in [7], explicit integral conditions are given for the existence of such a section. there

must exist a 1-cycle c so that any global holomorphic 1-form, , satises

 = 2

ic

k

xj=1

j(0)gj

(16)

where j(0) is the value of  at 0j, the point on the jth sheet above  = 0. gj is dened
by writing  = gjd at 0j. these are the ercolani-sinha conditions. c must be primitive
if the ls bundle on s is nontrivial for 0 < s < 2: another necessary condition.

in the calculation of section 2, the relationship between c and the l2 section will be

important. if {a1, . . . , ag, b1, . . . , bg} is a canonical homology basis,

g

c =

(nrar + mrbr)

(17)

where nr = 1

d log f1 and mr =  1

d log f1 are integers.

the twistor data for monopoles can also be used to derive a twistor space for the
k-monopole moduli space, mk. coordinates for mk are provided by the rational map
description [6]. this description relates a k-monopole to a degree k based rational map:
p(z)/q(z). q(z) is a monic polynomial of degree k and p(z) is a polynomial of degree k  1,
which has no factors in common with q(z). following hurtubise [14], the rational map
for a monopole can be constructed from the spectral curve and the trivialization of the
l2 bundle. a direction, , is chosen and

q(z; ) = p (z, )
p(z; )  f0(z, ) mod q(z).

(18)

now,

if q(z) has distinct roots, 1, . . . , k, coordinates for mk are given by
(1, . . . , k, p(1), . . . , p(k)). atiyah and hitchin point out in [1], that the symplectic
form

 =

k

xi=1

p(i)

4

(19)

2ihbr

xr=1
2ihar

has the property that  =  2 and is, therefore, an o(2) section over p1.

in the next section, the relationship between the rational map and the spectral curve
is exploited to clarify the relationship between this symplectic form and the generalized
legendre transformation.

2 the generalized legendre transform and monopole

moduli spaces

the formula for the spectral curve (14) denes i as roots of a polynomial equation

whose coecients are o(2j) sections. because of this,  can be rewritten

where

(20)

(21)

j =

and (, ) = log p(; ). j is not dened on the spectral curve, since  is not. in general,

ha d 6= 0 for a nontrivial cycle a.  can be dened by cutting the surface. the 1-forms

d and dj are dened on the uncut surface.

the patching formula for  follows from the l2 patching formula (15), since  =

log f1,

this, in turn, provides a patching formula for j,

(24)

now, as before, the integral around  = 0 is considered. because of the particular
form of the sum in the expression for h, the integral on p1 can be written as an integral
on the spectral curve.

next, the contour in the j integral must be moved from 0 to . this is not dicult

if the integral is rst rewritten as an integral on the spectral curve:

 is dened on the 4g-gon, formed by cutting the spectral curve along the canonical
homology 1-cycles ar and br for r = 1 . . . g. although the spectral curve is obtained
from the 4g-gon by identifying appropriate edges, the function  does not respect the
identications. in fact, since, for example,

d log f1 = 2in1

f ()d(cid:19) = ic

(28)

where f () is any function which is well-behaved on the edge and c is the special homology
cycle mentioned above (17). furthermore, it is easy to see that

thus, the legendre transformation of the k-monopole metric is given by

 3 d.

this f has also been considered by roger bielawski [3].

f is composed of integrals on the spectral curve, rather that on p1 itself. the
integrals can be rewritten as integrals on p1, although they become less succinct. if the
integral in the k = 2 case is rewritten in this way the f used by ivanov and rocek to

6

calculate the atiyah-hitchin metric [15] is recovered. in that case the two branches over
 = 0 dier only by a sign in  and the special contour, c, is an equator.

in the k = 2 case, the constraint (12) arising in the generalized legendre transform
construction is precisely the one that hurtubise demonstrates must be satised for a
spectral curve to ensure triviality of the l2 bundle [13]. in fact, it is true for all k, that
the generalized legendre transformation constraints are the l2 triviality conditions (16).
this is demonstrated by using the spectral curve equation to rewrite the integrands

in the constraint equations.

is a global holomorphic 1-form. in fact, these 1-forms form a basis for the global holomor-
phic 1-forms on the spectral curve. there, using the residue theorem on the right-hand
side of the equations shows that it is the ercolani-sinha constraint (16). it may be noted
that the right hand side of this equation is actually zero for j 6= 1 [12].

thus, the generalized legendre transform for monopole moduli space can be derived
from the twistor description of monopoles. the constraints on f are the ercolani-sinha
constraints. however, it should be emphasized that the ercolani-sinha constraints only
ensure that the l2 bundle is trivial and that the ls bundle is not trivial if s < 2. these
are necessary conditions. they are not sucient. the additional condition requires that
h 0(s, ls(k  2)) = 0 for 0 < s < 2.
it is possible that this condition may also be
interpreted in terms of the generalized legendre transformation.

the crucial step in calculating the constraints on f , is the derivation of the coecient
form of the patching equation by expanding the patching formula and moving the contour
in the j integral. mimicking this derivation also claries the relationship, explained in
[12], between the ercolani-sinha and corrigan-goddard conditions [5].

2.1 the point dyon limit

in this paper f has been calculated from the known k-monopole symplectic form.
in [15] ivanov and rocek found f for the 2-monopole metric by making a guess based
on the known asymptotic metric and then verifying this guess by explicit calculation of
the kahler form. in fact, the asymptotic metric has been calculated for k monopoles by
examining the dynamics of point dyons [8], this approximation was conrmed in [2]. it is
a simple matter to derive this asymptotic metric from f , thereby reversing, for general
k, the original derivation of f for k = 2.

the spectral curve for a single monopole located at (rez, imz, x) is

  z + 2x + z 2 = 0.

(37)

this is the sphere in t p1 corresponding to all the lines through the monopole location.
the spectral curve for k-monopoles located at well separated points (rezi, imzi, xi) is
approximated with exponential accuracy by the product of spheres [2]

where

(  i) = 0

yi=1

i = zi  2xi  zi 2.

the i and j spheres touch at two points, the two roots of i = j:

 
ij =

xij qx2

zij

ij + |zij|2

(38)

(39)

(40)

where zij = zi  zj and xij = xi  xj. it is known that the special contour c must change
sign under the reality transformation   1/ [12] and so must be a sum of contours
which run from  
ij on sphere
j. in order for f to generate the asymptotic metric c must be a sum of all such contours.

3 conclusions

the function f appropriate to the generalized legendre transform construction of multi-
monopole metrics is calculated by a simple change of variables. this function is a contour
integral over the spectral curve. the constraints on f are precisely the integral constraints
on the spectral curve required to ensure the existence of a trivial l2 bundle. in practice
these constraints are dicult to apply.

the generalized legendre transform was originally derived from a duality transfor-
mation on an n=4 supersymmetric -model. it would be interesting to understand what
relationship this -model has to monopoles.
