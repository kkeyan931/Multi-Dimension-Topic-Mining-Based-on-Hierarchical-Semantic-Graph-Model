1. introduction

in this note we study n coincident ns5-branes [1] in type ii theory.

in the limit
g00, ms xed (where g0 is the asymptotic value of the string coupling and ms is the
string mass) the theory is free in the bulk. however, modes living on the 5-brane continue

to interact amongst themselves, while decoupling from the bulk, dening a mysterious non-

gravitational six-dimensional theory [2] (this construction was motivated by [3]), sometimes

referred to as the little string theory. upon compactication, this theory inherits the t

duality of type ii string theory and is therefore nonlocal at the scale ms.

maldacena and strominger [4] studied the system of n non-extremal coincident ns5-

branes with excitation energy density m6

s. the classical solution for this conguration
possesses an asymptotically at region, which turns into a tube on approaching the 5-

brane. on descending down the tube one encounters the horizon of the black branes. the

local string coupling outside the horizon is everywhere less thanq n

 , and all curvatures
in this region are less than msn
. therefore, when   n  1 semi-classical gravity is
accurate outside the horizon. in particular, the brane hawking radiates at temperature

, and modes behind the horizon continue to couple to modes in the tube even for

this fact was interpreted in [5] as a manifestation of holography in the underlying

string theory. in particular, the decoupled theory of the ns5-branes is the holographic
projection, along the lines of [6], of the near horizon geometry (g0  0 limit) including the
long tube1. it was further proposed in [5] that some of the observables of the ns5-brane

theory are the on-shell particles (vertex operators in the string theory limit) in the bulk.

unlike the situation in ads, our geometry admits the denition of an s matrix. hence,

o-shell six-dimensional greens functions of these observables are identied as the s

matrix elements of the corresponding higher dimensional bulk particles.

it should be emphasized that the boundary of the near horizon geometry of the eu-
clidean ns5-brane is r6s3, and reduces to r6 only after a kaluza klein reduction on the
s3. this is in contrast with the near horizon geometry of, say, the euclidean m5-brane,
whose boundary is s6 rather than s6  s4 (because the ratio of the size of the s4 to that
of the s6 goes to zero on approaching the boundary).

1 similar ideas have been suggested by various people, including c.v. johnson, j. maldacena

and a. strominger.

1

the euclidean near horizon geometry of the ns5-brane consists of a semi-innite tube,
capped at the bottom by (euclidean) ads7  s4. let the analytic continuation of this
space to lorentzian signature be denoted by e. e possesses a future horizon h + and a
past horizon h each at nite ane distance, and so is geodesically incomplete. its metric
may be completed (see appendix d) by gluing together a new copy of e at each of the two

original horizons, and then continuing this procedure indenitely (just as the ads cylinder

may be constructed by gluing together copies of poincare patches at their horizons). the

resulting penrose diagram is shown in g. 1, and contains an innite number of pairs of
ii s, dierentiated in our notation by the subscript i. ii , together with the horizons hi
constitute the boundary of the ith wedge ei. it is not clear to us whether this analytic
continuation is physically relevant2.

the correlation functions dened in [5] in terms of s matrix elements are naturally

found in momentum space. however, it was pointed out by peet and polchinski [7] that

these answers cannot be fourier transformed to coordinate space, and therefore the little

string theory is nonlocal. the reason for that is that the momentum space answers are ob-

tained after a momentum dependent multiplicative renormalization with the characteristic
scale msn

. we will return to this below.

2 we thank o. aharony and t. banks for a useful discussion on this point.

2

aharony and banks [8] computed the entropy of the little string theory as a function

of energy  using its dlcq denition [9,10] and found 6n 
bekenstein-hawking entropy computed in [4]. this entropy formula suggests that the

, in agreement with the

ms

number of states in the system grows rapidly with energy, thus explaining why the typical

momentum space correlation function cannot be fourier transformed [7]. it also reproduces
the scale of nonlocality as msn

.

in this paper we study the propagation of a mode of the graviton, which propagates

like a minimal scalar in the supergravity background of n coincident iia ns5-branes. its

s matrix elements are interpreted as the correlation functions of the energy momentum

tensor of the little string theory. in section 2 we discuss the validity of the supergravity

approximation, dene variables, and set up our equations. in section 3 we compute the

absorption cross section of a graviton incident onto the 5-branes from the tube, and note
that it is nonzero at g0 = 0 for energies larger than msn
of [4].

in section 4 we follow [5] to derive an expression for the two point function of

. this result strengthens that

the energy momentum tensor of the little string theory, and comment on its structure.

in section 5 we explain the relation between our results and previous calculations.

in

appendix a we estimate the high energy behavior of the two point function of section 4

using the wkb approximation. in appendix b we develop a low energy expansion for the

two point function. in appendix c we study a simple toy model, similar in some ways to

the ns5-brane. in appendix d we discuss the causal structure of the geodesic completion

of the near horizon geometry of the ns5-brane.

in this paper we will restrict our attention to the iia version of the little string theory.

its moduli space of vacua is (r4s1)n
corresponding in m theory to the positions of the
n m5-branes in the transverse space and on the 11th circle. (2.1) is the solution that
corresponds to stacking all branes at the origin in the r4, but smearing them evenly over
the s1, and therefore does not correspond to any true vacuum (single point in moduli

sn

space) of the theory.

we wish to study the theory at the most singular point in its moduli space, where
all the branes are on top of each other both in r4 and s1. the corresponding classical

background is most conveniently written in eleven dimensions [11]

(2.2)

(2.3)

the 11th dimension is compact: x11 = x11 +2r11 and lp is the eleven-dimensional planck
length. for r  r11 the summation above may be replaced by an integral and we recover
(2.1), on dimensional reduction and transforming to the string frame. for r  r11 a
single term in the summation in (2.3) dominates, and (2.2) reduces to the near horizon

of n stacked m5-branes. therefore (2.2) represents asymptotic at space connected to
ads7  s4 by a long tube.

2.2. validity of supergravity

we start by considering the general case of m theory compactied on a circle, whose

physical radius varies in an arbitrary spatially dependent fashion in the ten non-compact

directions. we then specialize to m theory on (2.2).

when the physical length r11 of the m theory circle is much larger than lp (the eleven-

dimensional region) eleven-dimensional supergravity is valid for energies and curvatures
much smaller than 1
. when r11  lp (the ten-dimensional region) the local iia string

coupling g = ( r11

)

supergravity for energies and curvatures much smaller than the string scale. under these
conditions proper energies are smaller than mef f = g
. therefore, no kaluza klein
modes on the 11th circle are excited, and iia supergravity is identical to eleven-dimensional

r11  1

r11

supergravity.

4

in summary, eleven-dimensional supergravity may be used over all space for energies

, ms provided curvatures are small in string units in the ten-dimensional region,

  1
and in planck units in the eleven-dimensional region.

lp

throughout this paper g0 is taken to be very small, so that r11  lp  1

and
the energy condition above is satised if   ms. in the ten-dimensional region in (2.2),
r  r11n , the curvatures in string units are always less than 1n
. curvatures in the
eleven-dimensional region r  r11n are always less than n 1

3 in planck units.

hence 11d supergravity is valid in (2.2) for   ms and n  1. therefore, we study
xed3. in this limit classical

the theory in the t hooft limit ms, n with msn
supergravity is valid at all energies.

dene f (s, , ) as the unique solution to (2.13) obeying:

1. near ,  = 0 f = f (s, u), where u2 = 2 + 2. further f (s, u = 0) = 0 in euclidean
space. this condition ensures that in minkowski space at small u, f is a wave that car-

ries ux only into the 5-branes. it uniquely determines f (s, , ) up to a normalization

everywhere on the complex s plane. in particular at small u

c(s), d(s) are determined in principle by (2.13). in the absence of a complete solution

we list what we know about these two functions. note that c(s) and d(s) are real on the

negative real axis.

c. at s = 0 (2.13) becomes an equation for free propagation of waves in 4 spatial di-

small s by perturbing around this exact solution. in appendix b we show that in

perturbation theory c(s) and d(s) take the form (a similar result was anticipated in

[5])

3. absorption from the tube for s > 1

when s > 1 particles propagate in the tube. f (s, , ) for positive s is a solution
with unit ux incident down into the tube, ux |d(s)|2 is reected back up the tube, and
ux 1  |d(s)|2 is absorbed into the m5-branes. therefore, if a particle moves down the
tube, the probability that it will be reected back up the tube is |d(s)|2. the reection s
matrix element is 2s  1d(s) (see appendix c for our normalization of the s matrix).

since particles with s > 1 can be absorbed into the m5-branes, the reverse process 

the leakage of particles with s > 1 out of the ads region into the tube  is also possible.

this is unlike the situation with a stack of m5-branes in at space, which ceases to absorb
and emit particles in the decoupling limit lp0.

this observation strengthens the maldacena-strominger [4] non-decoupling from the

tube in two ways. first, the non-decoupling occurs at nite energy and does not require
energy densities. second, the non-decoupling occurs at energies above msn
below ms
n

, which is required for the validity of the maldacena-strominger approximations.

4. two point functions

4.1. the prescription

in this section we will use the holographic proposal of [5] to nd an expression for the

two point function of the little string theory operator o that couples to our minimal scalar

according to

sint =z d6x((x, l)o(x) + (x, l)o(x)).

(4.1)

since  is a mode of the graviton, we interpret o as a component of the energy momentum

tensor of the brane. we will be working in momentum space and use

let ho(k)o(k)i = (k)(kk), and dene a dimensionless two point function l(s) =

f (s,l,=0) (for l  1 the  dependence of f is exponentially small) is a
solution of (2.13), which is regular everywhere in euclidean space, and is unity at  = l.

h(s, , ) = f (s,,)

9

according to the prescription of [13,14] adapted to our situation, l may be found using

the classical action (2.12) evaluated on the classical solution h(s, , )

sb[h(s, l, )] = v m6

sl3 f (s, , )=l

we subtract from (4.2) the action evaluated on the free solution (cid:0) 
b =

, s(0)

c clearly motivates this prescription)

l(s) = l2[(s)  +(s)]d(s)l(s)+(s) = l2+(s)21  sd(s).

(4.3)

the renormalized correlation function is obtained by removing the l dependence, and is

given by

(s) = 21  sd(s).

(4.4)

the renormalized correlation function thus dened agrees with the reection s matrix

element computed in the previous section.

for small s (4.4) becomes

(s) = analytic +

s3 ln s + smaller terms.

this is exactly the two point function of the energy momentum tensor of the m5 theory,

which couples to a massless minimally coupled scalar in ads7. this is a consistency check,
since the iia little string theory reduces to the (0,2) theory at low energies.

4.2. the implications of momentum dependent renormalizations

in order to obtain a cut o (l) independent (s) from the bare two point function
l(s) we had to perform a momentum dependent multiplicative renormalization. an

additional nite momentum dependent renormalization would change the formula (4.4)

for (s). we have chosen our renormalization scheme to yield a two point function that

agrees with the s matrix computed in section 3. (strictly, this might leave an s dependent

phase ambiguity.)

a momentum dependent renormalization is not multiplicative in position space. this

may indicate the absence of a natural denition of the correlation function in position
space, hinting at nonlocality of the theory [7,8] at scale msn
distinct from the nonlocality at ms noted in [2].

. if correct, this eect must be

5. absorption from innity

in this section we consider ns5-branes in iia theory with small but nonzero asymp-

totic string coupling g0. the tube in the ns5-brane geometry is now of nite length,
and the asymptotically at part of the geometry cannot be ignored. we compute the

absorption probability for a particle incident onto the ns5-brane from asymptotic innity.

consider a wave with s > 1 incident (with zero momentum along the branes and the

sphere) onto the 5-brane. this wave may be partially reected at two locations - at the

entrance to the tube from asymptotic innity, with a reection amplitude r(s), and at the

entrance to the ads region from the tube, with a reection amplitude d(s).

in order to be absorbed a wave must penetrate the tube, and then either be absorbed,

or be reected an even number of times and then absorbed. thus the absorption amplitude

is

, is the ratio of ux
absorbed by the 5-branes and the ux incident on them from asymptotic innity. f may
be computed by matching an exact solution to the wave equation in the asymptotic and

with [15].

the absorption cross section of the 5-branes is related to the absorption probability
by  = 4 f
3 . notice that, in contrast with a stack of m5-branes in at space, the
absorption cross section for a stack of ns5-branes is not zero in the limit g00 (lp0).
this may be understood as follows. a particle incident on a stack of isolated m 5 branes

in at space has to tunnel through a broad potential barrier extending (in the usual
coordinates) from r = 1
 down to very small values of r. the suppression factor due to
this barrier goes to innity in the decoupling limit, so that, in order to send unit ux into

the m5-branes one needs to shine an innite amount of ux on them from innity.

a stack of ns5-branes is, as we have seen, an array of stacks of m5-branes. the

geometry very near any one element of the stack is identical to that of an m5 in at space,

11

but is signicantly dierent for r of order r11. since r110 in the decoupling limit, most
of the potential barrier present in the geometry of the isolated m5-brane is chopped o in

this modied geometry, and is replaced by the tube, through which particles with s > 1

propagate freely. the residual potential barrier results in only nite tunneling suppression

even in the decoupling limit. in order to send unit ux down to the 5-branes, one needs

to shine only a nite amount of ux onto the branes from innity.

that every geodesic in (a.3) except the one at 0 =  reaches  = 0,  = 0 (and so is
absorbed by the m5-brane) at a nite value of the ane parameter 0. as 0, 0
and the geodesic at 0 =  never reaches the horizon but is reected back.

hence, classically, a light ray propagating down the tube with no momentum along

the s3 or the brane is absorbed by the ns5-brane with unit probability and d  0.

appendix b. small s behavior

we wish to determine c(s) and d(s) for small s. to do this we must nd f (s, , ),

the solution to (2.13) subject to the conditions listed in section 2.5.

at s = 0 (2.13) has two linearly independent solutions that, for small ,  are functions

only of u2 = 2 + 2. they are

1 = 1,

2 =

xn=



[2 + (  2n)2] 3

2

.

for large  2 = 1

2 and for small u 2 = ( 1

u3 + 2(3)

(2)3 ).

f (s = 0, , ) is a linear combination of 1 and 2. regularity at u = 0 sets the
coecient of 2 to zero, and the normalization condition in sec 2.5 sets the coecient of
1 to unity. therefore, c(s = 0) = 1 and d(s = 0) = 0.

we iterate our solution to successively higher order in s. let

f = f0 + f1 + f2 + ...

c = c0 + c1 + c2 + ...

13

d = d0 + d1 + d2 + ...,

where fn, cn, dn are of successively of higher order in s (later in this appendix we will
nd that fn, cn, dn are each of the form snpn(ln s) where pn is a polynomial of degree
[ n
3 ]). above we have found f0 = 1, c0 = 1, d0 = 0. fn+1 is obtained from fn by solving
(2.13) iteratively,

(b.1) does not uniquely determine fn+1, since the dierential operator on the lhs of (b.1)
has two zero modes, 1 and 2. at large  f = +(s) + d(s)(s) may be expanded as

and so the freedom to add an arbitrary multiple of 1 to any solution of (b.1) is xed by
the condition that the coecient of the constant term in an expansion of fn+1() at large
 is zero. let n+1 be a particular solution of (b.1) obeying this asymptotic condition.
then

fm+1 = m+1 + bm+12,

where bm+1 is a constant determined by imposing regularity of f at small u. regularity of
f at u = 0 does not imply regularity of fm for any m 6= 0. it implies that fm is proportional

appendix c. a toy model

in the string frame, the near horizon geometry of the ns5-brane is a semi-innite tube,

connected through an intermediate region to the m5-brane geometry. a quantum incident

down the tube is either reected back up the tube, or continues through the horizon of the

5-brane and disappears.

in some ways this problem is similar to a free scalar eld theory with the action

s =

1

2z dxdt{(0)2  (x)2  (x)2}

(c.1)

in 1+1 dimensions. the region x < 0 is analogous to the tube, x > 0 is similar to the m5

region, while the abrupt change in mass at x = 0 is the analogue of the transition region

between the ns5 tube and the m5 region.

in this appendix we explore this toy model. we compute the s matrix of this model

in three dierent ways: using the lsz formula, computing ux ratios, and computing

the euclidean action as a function of boundary values. we then consider a holographic

projection of this theory, and demonstrate that the two point function of the boundary

operator is equal to the reection s matrix of the bulk particle.

c.1. the propagator

the euclidean space propagator

g(x, y, s) = z dtei(tt)sh(x, t)(y, t)i

(c.2)

is easily found by solving the appropriate dierential equation with the boundary condition
that it vanishes as either |x| or |y| go to innity. our conventions are such that s is real
and positive for lorentzian energies and real and negative for euclidean energies. we nd

equations (c.3)-(c.7) are valid by analytic continuation on the complex s plane with

when s > 1 we have two kinds of in states: particles with momentum pin = s  1 >

we also have two kinds of out states: particles with momentum pout = s  1 < 0 going
to the left and particles with momentum kout = s > 0 going to the right. we normalize
states covariantly so that hkin|kini = 2s(sin psin), hpin|pini = 2s  1(sin 
psin), and similarly for out states. the covariant s matrix with this normalization of

states is obtained by amputating the external propagators from (c.6). it is given by

inserting (c.9) into the the scalar product between two arbitrary in states we verify that

for s < 1 all particles incident from the right are reected, and the appropriately normal-

ized s matrix is a pure phase.

c.3. s matrix through ux ratios

the probability for a particle incident from the left at energy s to continue thorough
to x = , f , may be computed very simply. a purely in-going wave function for x > 0 is

with

and hence

f =

,

f = 1  |e|2 =

4ss  1
(s + s  1)2

.

this result is equivalent to the s matrix of the previous section. for instance, given
2s1 = e(s) (where we have accounted for state

(c.8), the amplitude for reection is

ll

normalizations and the delta function).

17

c.4. s matrix from the euclidean action

the scattering solution used in the ux computation of the previous section may be

analytically continued to the complex s plane

(x) =(cid:26) e1sx + e(s)e1sx x  0

f (s)esx

x  0,

(c.11)

where

f (s) =

21  s

for s real and negative we compute the action for this solution on l < x < .

(c.12)

thus after a subtraction and renormalization, the euclidean action reproduces the reec-

tion s matrix.

c.5. eective theory on the boundary

consider a distinct but related physical theory in which a free particle of unit mass

on the real line interacts with an operator o in a quantum mechanical system situated at
x = l via the interaction action

sint =z dt(l, t)o(t).

we will look for an o such that the (x, t) greens functions computed at x, y < l are
identical to (c.6).

the euclidean space  greens function is given by





j(y, 0)z desf ()+r d (l, )o( )+r d dj(, )(, )|j=0

eg(x, y, t) = 
= g0(x  y, t, m = 1) z dtd g0(x + l, t  , m = 1)g0(l  y, t, m = 1)ho( )o(t)i

j(x, t)

(c.13)

18

(sf () is the free euclidean action for the  eld) provided all higher n point functions of

o vanish. setting eg(x, y, s) =r dteisteg(x, y, t) we nd
eg(x, y, s) = g0(x  y, s, m = 1)

 g0(x  0, s, m = 1)g0(0  y, s, m = 1)e21slz dte
z dte
stho(t)o(0)i = e21slll(s) = s0  s.

we choose

stho(t)o(0)i.

(c.14)

this ensures eg(x, y, s) = g(x, y, s), and the dynamics of (x, t) for x < l in the new

system is identical to the dynamics of  governed by (c.1) for x < l. it should be stressed
that there is no simple quantum mechanical system with such correlation functions of o.

appendix d. geodesic completion of the brane metric5

in this appendix we describe the geodesic completion of the near horizon metric of

the ns5-brane. as a preliminary, following [16], we describe the completion of the full

(not merely near horizon) geometry of m2, m5 and d3 branes, and demonstrate that the

completion of the geometry of several separated m5-branes is regular.

d.1. coincident extremal m2,m5 and d3 branes [16]

the metric of a single wedge in the geometry of a set of coincident m2, m5 or d3

branes is

ds2 = a 2

p+1 dx2

p+1 + a

2

d2 (dr2 + r2d2

d1)

(d.1)

(0 < r < ), where p is the spatial dimension of the brane, d the spatial dimension of
the transverse space, and a = 1 + ( 
r )d2. the penrose diagram for this patch of the
geometry is a diamond whose edges on the right are i and those to the left are horizons
at t = , at nite ane distance.

p+1

d2 (where k is a constant) the metric of the near horizon region

in terms of  = kr

(d.2) may be smoothly continued past its horizons by extending the range of  to negative
values, hence the same is true of (d.1) (written in terms of ) for ||  k
|| the harmonic function a = 1 + d2
behaved for all  when p is odd, but vanishes at  = 
curvature singularity in (d.1) at that point.

d2 . for larger
 p+1 behaves dierently for odd and even p. a is well

p+1 when p is even, leading to a

p+1

the penrose diagram of (d.1) is a diamond. depending on whether p is even or

odd our extension of the geometry augments the diamond dierently. for p odd we add

another diamond whose bottom right edge is attached to the top left edge of the original
diamond. the two left edges of the new diamond are new i. the upper right edge is
a new horizon at nite ane distance. for p even we add a triangle, whose bottom right

edge is attached to the top left edge of the original diamond. the top right edge is a new

horizon at nite ane distance. the vertical line is the singularity.

in both cases the

extension to the original geometry has its own horizon at nite ane distance, which may

in turn be continued through. the corresponding penrose diagrams are depicted in g. 2.
each point on the diagram represents sd1  rp.

for a  = 0 slice of the near horizon region of the ns5-brane.

d.2. multiple m5 geometry [16]

the metric corresponding to two non-coincident p branes is of the form (d.1). the

harmonic function a however picks up an additional term corresponding to the second

20

brane. let the rst brane be located at the origin, and the second brane on the z axis at

z = a in a cartesian coordinate system in transverse space. the term in a corresponding

to the second brane is (recall r = k

(d.3)

we attempt to extend through the horizon of the rst brane by extending the range of 
to negative values. this is permissible only if p+1
d2 is an integer (in order for (d.3) to be
real). if p+1
d2 is moreover an even integer, as is the case for m5-branes, then the mirror
universe ( < 0) is identical to the original in every respect. therefore, this is also true of

any further extension through any other brane. the full space is completely regular.

d.3. the iia ns5-brane

consider an array of m5-branes periodically identied. the identication is regular

in each wedge as every wedges has the geometry of (2.2). since wedges in the multiple m5

geometry may be patched together in a regular manner we conclude that the full geometry

is regular.

we focus on the near horizon region of the ns5-brane geometry. the geodesic com-
pletion of a  = 0 slice of (2.10) has the penrose diagram depicted in g. 2a, where i
represent light-like asymptotic innity in the ns5-brane tube. as demonstrated in ap-

pendix a, null geodesics starting out in the tube at arbitrary values of  are qualitatively

similar to those starting at  = 0, and so g. 2a provides a fair picture of the causal

structure of the spacetime. each point in the diagram may roughly be thought of as the
product of r5, an s3 and an s1. the s1 shrinks to zero size at the boundaries of the

diagram.
