quantum eld theory synthesis two topics. thus, intuition case probably habit: approach actually historical traditional , recounting chronological development subject. generally rst half (or volume) devoted quantum electrodynamics, treated way viewed 1950s, second half tells story quantum chromodynamics, understood 1970s. dualistic approach necessarily redundant, e.g., using canonical quantization qed path-integral quantization qcd, contrary scientic principles, advocate applying unied methods theories. teachers may feel comfortable beginning topic way rst learned it, students may wonder course didnt begin approach wind using end. topics unfamiliar authors intuition often labeled formal (lacking substance) even mathematical (devoid physics). recent topics usually treated ad- vanced: opposite often true, since explanations simplify time, topic better understood. positive side, approach generally presents topics better experimental verication.

(2) hand, authors express desire introduce feynman graphs quickly possible: suggests lack appreciation eld theory outside diagrammatics. many essential aspects eld theory (such symmetry breaking higgs eect) seen action, analysis also leads better methods applying perturbation theory obtained xed set rules. also, functional equations often simpler pictorial ones, especially nonlinear elds. result over-emphasizing calculations cookbook, kind familiar lower-division undergraduate courses intended physics majors designed engineers. best explanation theory one ts principles scientic method : simplicity, generality, experimental verication. text thus take economical pragmatic approach, methods based eciency power. unattractiveness counter-intuitiveness methods become ad- vantages, force one accept new better ways thinking subject: eciency method directs one underlying idea. example, although consider einsteins original explanation special relativity terms relativistic trains lorentz transformations square roots be- ing physical, concept minkowski space gave much simpler explanation deeper understanding proved useful led generalization. many theories miraculous cancellations traditional methods used, led new methods (background eld gauge, supergraphs, spacecone, etc.) incorporate cancellations automatically (so zeros need calculated), built principles explain them. place emphasis new concepts, well calculational methods allow compared nature. important neglect one sake other, articial misleading try separate them. 25 result, many explanations standard topics new textbooks, completely new. example: (1) derive foldy-wouthuysen transformation dimensional reduction analogous one massless case (subsections iib3,5). (2) cosmology discussed dilaton instead full general relativity (subsection iva7). minor fudges, sucient post-ination universe observations. (3) derive feynman rules terms background elds rather sources (subsection vc1); avoids need amputation external lines s- matrices eective actions, useful background-eld gauges. (4) obtain nonrelativistic qed eective action, used modern treatments lamb shift (because makes perturbation easier older bethe- salpeter methods), eld redenition relativistic eective action (sub- section viiib6), rather tting parameters comparing feynman diagrams relativistic nonrelativistic actions. (in general, manipulations action easier diagrams.) (5) present two somewhat new methods solving covariant derivatives curvature general relativity slightly easier previous meth- ods (subsections ixa2,a7,c5). also completely new topics, like: (1) anti-gervais-neveu gauge, spin u(n) yang-mills treated al- way internal symmetry chan-paton factors (subsection vib4); (2) superspacecone gauge, simplest gauge qcd (subsection vib7); (3) new (almost-)rst-order superspace action supergravity, analogous one super yang-mills (subsection xb1). try give simplest possible calculational tools, reasons, also group theory (internal spacetime) integrals per- formed least eort memory. traditionalists may claim old methods easy enough, arguments less convincing order perturbation increased. even computer calculations ecient left last resort; cant see whats going computers calcu- lating, dont gain new understanding. give examples (and exercises on) methods, exhaustively. also include recent topics (or recently appreciated particle physics community) might deemed non-introductory, commonly used, simple important enough include earliest level. example, related topics (unitary) lightcone 26 gauge, twistors, spinor helicity absent eld theory texts, result text performs calculation basic diagram 4-gluon tree amplitude. another missing topic relation qcd strings random worldsheet lattice large-color (1/n) expansion, known method might quantitatively describe high-energy nonperturbative behavior (bound states arbitrarily large mass). text meant cover eld theory every high energy theorist know, particular theorist might need know. meant introduction research, preliminary courses: try cracks often lie standard eld theory courses advanced specialized courses. example, discussion string theory, oriented toward strong interactions, experimental justication, rather quantum gravity unication, usefulness still investigation. mention statistical mechanics, although many eld theory methods discuss useful there. also, discuss experimental results detail; phenomenology analysis experiments deserve text. give apply methods calculation discuss qualitative features results, make numerical comparison nature: concentrate forest trees. unfortunately, discussions (somewhat related) topics infrared-diver- gence cancellation, lamb shift, parton model sketchy, due inability give fully satisfying treatments maybe later edition? unlike previous texts quantum eld theory, one available free internet (as usual, arxiv.org mirrors), may periodically updated. errata, additions, changes posted web page http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/siegel/plan.html enough accumulated new edition. electronic distribution many advantages: free. available quickly easily. download arxive.org mirrors, like preprints, without trip library (where may checked out) bookstore waiting order publisher. (if connection slow, download overnight.) wont go print. download work, home, etc. (or carry cd), rather carrying book printing multiple copies. get updates quickly, rather printing yet again. usual web links, get referenced papers easily. 27 separate outline window containing table contents click take main window item. electronically search (do nd on) text. easier read computer screen (arbitrary magnication, etc.) save trees, ink, space. theft problem. wear tear. paper cuts. even add notes (far bigger would margin) various software programs. highlights preceding table contents lists three parts text: symmetry, quanta, higher spin. part divided four chapters, three sections, divided subsections. section followed references reviews original papers. exercises appear throughout text, immediately following items test: purposely disrupts ow text, forcing reader stop think learned. exercises interesting right, examples memory tests. crime homeworks exams, least graduate school grades. text also diers following ways: (1) place greater emphasis mechanics introducing ele- mentary physical concepts eld theory: (a) basic ideas, antiparticles, simply understood al- ready classical mechanics. (b) interactions also treated rst-quantization: suf- cient evaluating certain tree one-loop graphs particles external elds. also, schwinger parameters understood rst-quantization: useful performing momentum integrals (reducing gaus- sians), studying high-energy behavior feynman graphs, nding singularities way exposes classical mechanics interpreta- tion. (c) quantum mechanics similar free classical eld theory, usual semiclassical correspondence (duality) particles (mechanics) waves (elds). use wave equations, since mechanics hamil- tonian becchi-rouet-stora-tyutin operator kinetic operator 28 corresponding classical eld theory, free theories equivalent. particular, (relativistic) quantum mechanical brst provides simple expla- nation o-shell degrees freedom general gauge theories, in- troduces concepts useful string theory. nonrelativistic case, treatment starts directly quantum mechanics, rather (rst-) quantization classical mechanical system. since supersymmetry strings important present theoretical research, useful text includes eld theory concepts prerequisites course topics. (for reason, treated similarly yang-mills, also discuss general relativity.) (2) also emphasize conformal invariance. although badly broken symmetry, fact larger poincare invariance makes useful many ways: (a) general classical theories described simply rst analyzing conformal theories, introducing mass scales various techniques. particularly useful general analysis free theories, nding solutions gravity theories, constructing actions supergravity theories. (b) spontaneously broken conformal invariance produces dilaton, used place general relativity describe cosmology. (c) quantum theories well-dened within perturbation theory confor- mal (scaling) high energies. (a possible exception string theories, supposedly well understood string theories nite perturbatively discovered hard-to-quantize membranes disguise nonper- turbatively.) makes methods based conformal invariance useful nding classical solutions, well studying high-energy behavior quantum theory, simplifying calculation amplitudes. (d) theories whose conformal invariance (further) broken quantum cor- rections avoid certain problems nonperturbative level. thus conformal theories ultimately may required unambiguous description high- energy physics. (3) make extensive use two-component (chiral) spinors, ubiquitous particle physics: (a) method twistors (more recently dubbed spinor helicity) greatly sim- plies lorentz algebra feynman diagrams massless (or high-energy) particles spin, standard qcd. (twistors also re- lated conformal invariance self-duality.) hand, texts still struggle 4-component dirac (rather 2-component weyl) spinor 29 notation, requires gamma-matrix fierz identities, discussing qcd calculations. (b) chirality duality important concepts interactions: two- component spinors rst found useful weak interactions days 4-fermion interactions. chiral symmetry strong interactions important since early days pion physics; related topic instantons (self-dual solutions) simplied two-component notation, general self-dual solutions expressed terms twistors. duality simplest two-component spinor notation, even applied electromagnetic eld. (c) supersymmetry still convincing experimental verication (at least moment im typing this), theoretical properties promise solve many fundamental problems quantum eld theory. (although experimental evidence supersymmetry, also experimental evidence higgs boson. equally important predictability particle physics, although one seen perturbation theory, attempting resum it.) element proposed generalizations standard model. chiral symmetry built supersymmetry, making two-component spinors unavoidable. (4) topics ordered pedagogical manner: (a) abelian nonabelian gauge theories treated together using modern techniques. (classical gravity treated methods.) (b) classical yang-mills theory discussed quantum eld theory. allows much physics, standard model (which may appeal wider audience), yang-mills essential part, introduced earlier. particular, symmetries mass generation standard model appear already classical level, seen easily action (classically) eective action (quantum) diagrams. (c) method path integrals used second-quantization. canonical quantization cumbersome hides lorentz invariance, emphasized even feynman introduced diagrams. thus avoid spurious concepts dirac sea, supposedly explains positrons totally inapplicable bosons. however, quantum physics general systems single particles, operator methods powerful type rst-quantization classical system, path integrals mainly pedagogical interest. therefore review quantum physics rst, discussing various properties (path integrals, s-matrices, unitar- ity, brst, etc.) general (but simpler) framework, properties 30 need rederived special case quantum eld theory, path-integral methods sucient well preferable. (5) gauge xing discussed way general ecient older methods: (a) best gauge studying unitarity (unitary) lightcone gauge. rarely appears eld theory (and gravity) texts, treated half way, missing important explicit elimination unphysical degrees free- dom. (b) ghosts introduced brst symmetry, proves unitarity showing equivalence convenient manifestly covariant gauges manifestly unitary lightcone gauge. applied directly classical action, avoiding explicit use functional determinants older faddeev- popov method. also allows direct introduction general gauges (again classical level) use nakanishi-lautrup elds (which omitted older treatments brst), rather functional averaging landau gauges required faddeev-popov method. (c) nonabelian gauge theories background eld gauge must. makes eective action gauge invariant, slavnov-taylor identities need applied it. beta functions found propagator corrections. (6) dimensional regularization used exclusively (with exception one-loop axial anomaly calculations): (a) one preserves possible symmetries, well one practical enough higher-loop calculations. (b) also use exclusively infrared regularization, allowing divergences regularized single regulator (in contrast, e.g., three regu- lators used standard treatment lamb shift). (c) good regularization, renormalization (dimensional renormalization). example, renormalization group simply de- scribed using dimensional regularization methods. importantly, renor- malization performed simply minimal prescription implied dimensional regularization. unfortunately, many books, even among use dimensional regularization, apply complicated renormalization procedures require additional, nite renormalizations prescribed slavnov-taylor identities. needless duplication eort ignores manifest gauge invariance whose preservation led choice dimen- sional regularization rst place. using dimensional renormalization, gauge theories easy treat scalar theories: brst applied amplitudes explicitly, since dimensional regularization renormalization procedure preserves it. 31 (7) perhaps fundamental omission eld theory texts expansion qcd inverse number colors: (a) provides gauge-invariant organization graphs subsets, allowing simplications calculations intermediate stages, commonly used qcd today. (b) useful perturbation expansion, whose experimental basis okubo-zweig-iizuka rule. (c) nonperturbative level, leads resummation diagrams way associated strings, suggesting explanation connement. (8) treatment gravity closely related applied yang-mills theory, diers texts gravity: (a) emphasize action deriving eld equations gravity (and matter), rather treating afterthought. (b) make use local (weyl) scale invariance cosmological spherically symmetric solutions, gauge xing, eld redenitions, studying conformal properties. particular, texts neglect (unphysical) dilaton, crucial treatments (especially generalization supergravity strings). (c) gravity texts leave spinors till end, treat briey, discussion gravity based methods applied directly spinors, therefore supergravity superstrings. (d) methods calculating curvatures purposes solving classical eld equations somewhat new, probably simplest, directly related simplest methods super yang-mills theory supergravity. notes instructors text intended reference basis course relativistic quantum eld theory second-year graduate students. rst two parts repeatedly used one-year course taught stony brook. (there comfortably one year, skipped subsections, choice varied.) also includes material used one-semester relativity course, third one-year string course, also gave several times used following: relativity: ia, b3, c2; iia; iiia-c5; iva7; vib1; ix; xia3, a5-6, b1-2 strings: iib1-2; viia2, b5, c4; viiib2, c4-5; xi; xiia2, b1-3, b8 32 prerequisites (for quantum eld theory course) usual graduate courses classical mechanics, classical electrodynamics, quantum mechanics. example, student familiar hamiltonians lagrangians, lorentz transformations particles electromagnetism, green functions wave equations, su(2) spin, hilbert space. unfortunately, nd many second- year graduate students (especially many got undergraduate training usa) still undergraduate level understanding prerequisite topics, lacking working knowledge action principles, commutators, creation annihilation operators, etc. topics briey reviewed here, learned elsewhere. generally students need prepared begin research beginning third year. means begin preparation research middle second year, standard courses high-energy theorists, quantum eld theory (and maybe even string theory), already nished then. rather dicult, considering quantum eld theory usually considered one- year course follows one-year prerequisites. best solution would improve undergraduate courses, making less repetitive, rst-semester graduate courses could eliminated. easier x would make graduate courses ecient, least better coordinated modern. example: (1) sometimes relativistic quantum mechanics taught second semester quantum mechanics. done consistently, wouldnt need treated quantum eld theory course. (2) useful parts classical electrodynamics covered rst semester. (do physicists really need learn wave guides?) especially true methods solving wave equations (special functions, radiation, etc.) covered twice, quantum mechanics electromagentism. furthermore, know (since early 20th century) electromagnetism useful classical eld theory: one-year course classical eld theory, covering electromagnetism, also yang-mills general relativity? (3) lot important concepts standard model (especially electroweak interactions) essentially classical: spontaneous symmetry breaking, higgs eect, tree graphs, etc. could covered third semester classical eld theory. (4) meanwhile, true quantum eld theory (quantization, loops, etc.) could become third semester quantum theory, taken parallel standard model. (5) much string theory mechanics, eld theory. string theory course could begin rst semester second year (classical statistical mechanics covered rst year). summary, curriculum high-energy theorists could look something like... 33 sem. mechanics 1 2 3 classical mechanics statistical mechanics yang-mills & gravity strings standard model classical elds actions & symmetries quantum theory quantum solving wave equations quantum eld theory followed advanced courses (e.g., quantum eld theory strings). alternative start quantum eld theory second semester rst year. unfortunately, places students start quantum eld theory second year, little relativistic quantum mechanics yang-mills, subjects comprise rst semester quantum eld theory course, true quantum eld theory wait till second semester year. various scenarios, ordering chapters somewhat exible: ow indicated following 3d plot: lower spin higher spin classical symmetry elds iii quantum quantize v loop vii ix x xi xii bose fermi ii iv vi viii 3 dimensions spin (j), quantization (h), statistics (s): three independent ows page, right, page.

(if dont think so, name harder one level.) knew undergraduate physics hard major. students plan research eld theory nd topic challenging; less enthusiasm topic may nd overwhelming. main dierence eld theory lower courses set stone: much variation style content among eld theory courses than, e.g., quantum mechanics courses, since quantum mechanics (to extent taught courses) pretty much nished 1920s, eld theory still active research topic, even though many experimentally conrmed results since 1940s. result, eld theory course avor research: set mathematically rigorous rules solve problem. answers nal, treated questions: one satised solution problem, consider rst step toward generalization. student expect capture details eld theory rst time through, since many yet fully understood people work area. (it far likely instead discover details missed earlier courses.) one reminder: reason lectures (including seminars conferences) attendees ask questions (and private), stupid questions (except infamous many questions exam?). half teaching responsibility instructor. students good undergraduate background may want begin graduate school taking eld theory. dicult, sure good understanding following topics: (1) classical mechanics: hamiltonians, lagrangians, actions; lorentz transforma- tions; poisson brackets (2) classical electrodynamics: lagrangian electromagnetism; lorentz transfor- mations electromagnetic elds, 4-vector potential, 4-vector lorentz force law; green functions 35 (3) quantum mechanics: coupling electromagnetism; spin, su(2), symmetries; green functions schrodinger equation; hilbert space, commutators, heisen- berg schrodinger pictures; creation annihilation operators, statistics (bosons fermions); jwkb expansion necessary familiar topics, briey reviewed, topics familiar enough time catch up. standard undergraduate education three courses enough. acknowledgments thank everyone discussed eld theory, especially gordon chalmers, marc grisaru, marcelo leite, martin rocek, jack smith, george sterman, peter van nieuwenhuizen. generally, thank human race, without work would neither possible necessary. december 20, 1999 version 2 update contains new topics subsections, many small changes (amounting 10% increase size): corrections, improved explanations, exam- ples, (20% more) exercises, gures, references, cosmetics (including color), expanded outline aftermath. also small additions, fundamental explanation causality unitarity quantum mechanics, use weyl scaling general method spherical (as well cosmological) solutions einsteins equations. texs either ordinary tex pdftex.

(this true case gravity, constant term lagrangian gauge invariant itself.) linear term describes decay particle vacuum: implies wrong vacuum. linear term necessarily derivatives (otherwise boundary term, vanishes boundary conditions); part eective potential (a generalization potential energy, whose contribution classical mechanics lagrangian contains time derivatives; see subsection viib2). existence linear term means minimum eective potential, i.e., true vacuum, described vanishing elds. correct situation therefore apply procedure classical action (chapter iv): (1) shift appropriate elds constants, put us minimum potential, (2) use new quadratic terms potential determine true masses states dened perturbation c. s-matrix 343 new vacuum. eliminating constant terms, resulting quadratic higher-order terms. summarize, general procedure calculating feynman graphs is: (1) calculate eective action, i.e., 1pi graphs. (2) shift scalars put minimum eective potential, dropping resultant constant, reveal true masses particles. (3) calculate s-matrix diagrams without external-line corrections, ex- ternal wave functions whose normalization masses determined zeroes kinetic operators shifted . another use eective action, besides organizing calculation s- matrix, studying low-energy behavior: means apply expansion derivatives, rst-quantized jwkb (see subsection va2). interest lowest order approximation, elds eectively constant: gives eective potential. (in practice, elds means scalars, since constant spinor elds generally useful, higher spins described gauge elds, whose constant pieces set vanish appropriate formulation: e.g., constant piece metric tensor attributed scalar see subsection ixa7.) however, denition 1pi graphs ambiguous, depending dene particle: example, include auxiliary elds eective action (as supersymmetry, also bound-state problems: see subsections viib3 6), result xed order expansion parameter (h, coupling, etc.) dierent, since auxiliaries get contributions order, elminating eective-action eld equations mixes orders. (e.g., b2 + hbf (a) h2f 2.) crucial composite elds dened auxiliaries, thus auxiliaries themselves, obtain vacuum values. therefore, eective action useful purposes when, appropriate choice elds denition h, useful rst-quantized semiclassical expansion found. another important use eective action gauge invariant (even nonabelian case, using background-eld gauge; see subsection vib8): sometimes simplications due gauge invariance thus easier see eective action s-matrix. consider interesting topological property graphs: (1) graph, draw extra propagator vertex another, gives extra loop (closed circuit) extra vertices.

(compare discussion wick rotation action subsection vb4.) using anticommuting elds describe fermions formality. gen- eral, signicance describing states quantizing classical elds commute anticommute two purposes: (1) avoid multiple counting indistinguish- able particles, (2) insure two identical fermions occupy state. thus, describing two particles dierent states, phase associated (anti)commutation irrelevant: klein transformation made makes anticommuting quantities commute dierent states, anticommute (i.e., square zero) state. however, transformations nonlocal, locality crucial relativistic eld theory.

(any tree graph simple example.) two-particle states appear cuts invariants, branch point represents state two particles rest respect one another, rest cut corresponds arbitrary relative velocities.
