(3.2) (3.3) would like take t-duality along x2-direction. hence need u(1) isometry along direction. however, functions depending x2- coordinate sin x2 cos x2 deformed conifold metric (2.17) replacements. assume become constants a1 a2 delocalization. eqs.(2.18), (2.19) (2.20) become ds2 1 = (dx2 + b1dx3 + b2dx5)2, 6 ds2 ds2 (dxi)2, xi=3 2 = 3 = 2 (a1 (dx3 dx6 + dx5 dx4) + a2 (dx4 dx6 dx3 dx5)).
