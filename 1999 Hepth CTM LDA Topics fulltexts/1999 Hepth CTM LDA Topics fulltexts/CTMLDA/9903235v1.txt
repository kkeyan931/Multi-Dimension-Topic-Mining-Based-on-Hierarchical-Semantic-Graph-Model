we point out that the statements in [hep-th/9903063] concerning the regularity of static axially
symmetric solutions in yang-mills-dilaton (ymd) [1] and einstein-yang-mills(-dilaton) (eymd)
theory [2,3] are incorrect, and that the non-singular local gauge potential of the ymd solutions [4]
is twice dierentiable.

we have constructed numerically static axially symmetric solutions in yang-mills-dilaton (ymd) [1] and einstein-
yang-mills-dilaton (eymd) theory [2,3], employing a singular form of the gauge potential. for the solutions of ymd
theory we have recently demonstrated explicitly, that the singular gauge potential can be locally gauge transformed
into a well dened gauge potential [4].

after that, hannibal has claimed in his paper [5], we show that the solutions of su (2) yang-mills-dilaton and
einstein-yang-mills-dilaton theories described in a sequence of papers by kleihaus and kunz are not regular in the
gauge eld part(*). here we comment on this paper [5] only as far as our work [14] is concerned.

in [5] static axially symmetric ansatze for the su (2) gauge potential [6,13] have been considered and regularity
conditions for the gauge eld functions parameterizing the ansatz [3] have been derived [7]. comparing the properties
of the gauge eld functions employed in [13] to these regularity conditions, it was then concluded in [5], that the
solutions constructed by kleihaus and kunz [13] do not have the regular form.

while the solutions constructed numerically in [13] are presented within a singular form of the gauge potential in
the sense, that the gauge potential is not well dened on the z-axis and at the origin [4], this, however, only means
that regularity of the solutions is not guaranteed a priori. it does not mean, that the solutions are not regular.

since the gauge potential transforms under gauge transformations, a regular gauge potential a can be gauge
transformed into a singular gauge potential a by a singular gauge transformation. both gauge potentials would
describe the same physical solution. from the observation that the gauge potential a is in a singular form, one
could neither conclude that there is no regular gauge potential a nor, in particular, that the physical solution is not
regular. therefore, the claim (*) in the abstract of hannibals paper [5] is not correct and misleading.

hannibal [5] has then considered the gauge transformation [4], which transforms locally the singular gauge potential
of ymd solutions [1] into a non-singular gauge potential. he recognizes, that the transformed gauge potential is
continuous at  = 0 (i. e. at x = y = 0), but he claims that the potentials are still possibly not dierentiable at
 = 0.

however, it is a trivial task to check that the transformed gauge potential [4] is dierentiable. for instance for
winding number n = 2 and z > 0, the non-singular gauge potential is given explicitly in [4] in cartesian coordinates,

in addition it is evident, that the gauge potential is twice dierentiable at x = y = 0, provided one can show that
no functions like x, y arise from the next to leading order terms. but this is straightforward, since it concerns only
the function f4, multiplying the matrix 3, see [4]. observing from [4], that the functions h3 and (n)
(z) are odd in 
up to order 3 (inclusively) while the function h4 is even in  up to order 2, it is easy to see, that the function f4 is
odd in  up to order 3. thus the next to leading order term vanishes, indeed. at the origin a similar consideration
shows that the next to leading order terms only contribute functions which are twice dierentiable at the origin.
consequently, the gauge transformed gauge potential is twice dierentiable, even in the lowest order of the expansion
[4].

nevertheless, we have carried out the expansion near the positive z-axis to the next order and have found that
the next to leading order terms vanish for all gauge eld functions for the ymd solutions [1] with winding number
n = 2, 3 [8].

to conclude, it has not been shown in [5] that the static axially symmetric solutions constructed numerically in
[13] are not regular. furthermore, the non-singular gauge potentials obtained to lowest order in [4] are continuous,
dierentiable and twice dierentiable at x = y = 0 and at the origin. consequently, the singular gauge potential of
the solutions obtained in [1] can locally be gauge transformed into regular form.
