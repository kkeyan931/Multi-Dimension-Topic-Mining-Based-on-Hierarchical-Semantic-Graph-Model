motivated by the debate of possible denitions of mass and width of resonances for z-boson and
hadrons, we suggest a denition of unstable particles by minimally complex semigroup represen-
tations of the poincare group characterized by (j, s = (m  i/2)2) in which the lorentz subgroup
is unitary. this denition, though decidedly distinct from those based on various renormalization
schemes of perturbation theory, is intimately connected with the rst order pole denition of the
s-matrix theory in that the complex square mass (m  i/2)2 characterizing the representation
of the poincare semigroup is exactly the position sr at which the s-matrix has a simple pole.
wigners representations (j, m) are the limit case of the complex representations for  = 0. these
representations have generalized vectors (gamow kets) which have, in addition to the s-matrix pole
at s = (m  i/2)2, all the other properties that heuristically the unstable states need to possess:
a breit-wigner distribution in invariant square mass and a lifetime  = 1
 dened by the exactly
exponential law for the decay probability p(t) and rate p(t) given by an exact golden rule which
becomes diracs golden rule in the born-approximation. in addition and unintended, they have
an asymmetric time evolution.

i. introduction and motivation

the meaning of unstable elementary particles and/or resonances  in particular in the relativistic domain  has
always been a subject of controversy and debates which are-up whenever new phenomena compel us to re-examine
our old ideas and prejudices. recently it was the line shape of the z-boson in the analyses of the lep and slc
data of ee  f f (+n) that gave rise to the revision of old ideas. two dierent approaches have been used in the
determination of the line shape and the denition of the line shape parameters [1,2]. the rst and popular approach,
which practically all experimental analyses of the lep and slc data follow [3], is based on the on-shell denition
of mass mz and width z. mass and width are dened in perturbation theory by the self-energy of the z-boson
propagator. the on-shell denition of mass and width denes the (real) mass mz as the renormalized mass in the
on-shell renormalization scheme by the real part of the self-energy. this choice of mz as the mass of the z is arbitrary.
the s-dependent width z(s) (which is not a parameter of the standard model but a derived quantity) is given by the
imaginary part of the self-energy in terms of the parameters of the standard model and mz, and thus suers from
the same degree of arbitrariness. in this on-shell approach, the (radiation corrected) cross sections around the z peak
are tted to a breit-wigner amplitude with energy dependent width given by

aj(s) = 

spe(s)f (s)
z + isz(s) 
s  m 2

where for the z boson propagator (neglecting the fermion mass)

have been used.

(2)

once the arbitrariness of the on-shell renormalization scheme [46] and its problems with gauge invariance of mz
and z [7,8] were realized, a second approach to the z-boson line shape was suggested. this was based on the s-
matrix denition of the mass and width for an unstable particle with spin j by the pole position sr = (mr  ir/2)2
of the resonance pole on the second sheet of the j-th partial s-matrix element (or equivalently the position sr of the
propagator pole). with this denition, the j-th partial amplitude for the z-boson is again given by a breit-wigner
amplitude

aj(s) =

rz

2 (cid:1)2 =

, ii < s < + .

since the s-matrix pole is in the second riemann sheet the values of s should presumably also extend over the entire
real axis in the second sheet. this makes a dierence not for the physical (positive) values of s along the cut but only
for the negative values as indicated by ii in (3). usually the range of s is not stated and may often be presumed
to extend over the values along the cut only, s0 = (me + me)2 < s < , but it will turn out below that s should range
as stated in (3). the width  and mass mr are now the xed basic s-matrix parameters, independent of the energy
s or a particular renormalization scheme. according to the results of references [5,6] the two denitions dier in value
by an amount exceeding the experimental error :

mr  mz  26 mev ,   z(s = m 2

z)  1.2 mev .

(4)

there are other channels in addition to the z-channel to which the initial and nal state of the lep experiment
can couple, e.g., the photon channel and additional channels of which the phase shifts are assumed non-resonant. this
means we have a double multichannel resonance [9] with background

ee 

z
  f f + n .

(5)

the partial wave amplitude is a superposition of the z-boson breit-wigner (3), the -breit-wigner and a slowly
varying background amplitude b(s) (constant in the z energy region) :

aj(s) =

rz
s  sr

+

r

s

+ b(s) .

(6)

with the amplitude (6), the s-matrix approach and the standard model (on-shell) approach, (using in place of (3)
the expression (1) for the z-boson propagator in (6)), led to similar formulas for the total cross section and the
asymmetries, except for the energy independence of the width  in the s-matrix approach [1]. these formulas in
both approaches contain the z-breit-wigner, the photon term (-breit-wigner) and the z   interference term
which is important for the ts of various asymmetries. fits of these formulas for the two dierent approaches to the
experimental cross sections and asymmetries were equally good. they led to equally accurate tted values for mass
and width in both approaches, which diered by the expected mass shift (4) [1,10,11]. the experimental data for the
z-boson can not discriminate between the two dierent denitions of the z-mass and width.

though the phenomenological ansatz can be justied in both approaches, theoretically, the on-shell denition of
the standard model [12] and the pole denition of the s-matrix theory [13] are worlds apart. in the latter case,
the resonance is an elementary particle characterized (in addition to its spin j (and internal or channel or resonance
species quantum numbers)) by the complex number sr, and diers from the corresponding denition of a stable
particle (bound state pole) just by a non-zero complex part [13]. in the former case, the resonance is a complicated
phenomenon which cannot be dened by a number, real or complex. theoretically, the s-matrix denition has the
advantage of gauge invariance and there does not seem to be a consensus whether the on-shell denition of mz can be
gauge invariant. but, besides the on-shell renormalization scheme, there are other renormalization schemes, including
the one based on the complex valued position of the propagator pole, and many more dierent ones which lead to
gauge invariant (m





z, 

z)s [14].

the denition of resonance mass and width in (perturbation theory of) the standard model remains ambiguous
unless some further stipulations are added. therefore, after the above reviewed developments, the popular opinion
appears to have changed in favor of the s-matrix denition of m and . however, even for the s-matrix denition
, the mass and width of the z resonance are not uniquely dened [2].

the insight acquired from the investigation of the line shape problems of the z-boson inuenced the ideas about
hadron resonances [15]. the conventional approach [3] for hadron resonances has also been to parameterize the
amplitude in terms of a breit-wigner (1) with energy dependent width h(s) (which is not as simple as (2) but
depends upon the model used for the energy dependence and the denition of mh). however there has been an ongoing
pole-emic in favor of the s-matrix pole denition of hadron resonances [16] and the recent editions of reference [3]
list for the baryon resonances like the 33 the values of the conventional parameters mh(= 1232 mev for ) and

2

(mh)(= 120 mev for ) as well as the pole position sh(cid:0)=(cid:0)1210  i 100

conventional one based on (1) and the s-matrix approach based on (3), were applied to the -meson data [15,17]
and compared with each other, the conclusion was that the s-matrix denition of m and  is phenomenologically
preferred. the reason given was that these tted parameters remained largely independent of the parameterization of
the background term b(s) and the  interference. a similar t to the s-matrix breit-wigner (3) was performed for
the experimental data on p scattering in the  resonance region [18]. again the tted values for the pole denition
(3) of mr and  are independent of the background parameterization and signicantly smaller than the conventional
values from (1). the interpretation of [16] is that the pole position sh belongs to the -resonance whereas the

2 (cid:1) mev(cid:1) 1. when both approaches, the

conventional parameters (cid:0)mh, (m 2

h)(cid:1) belong to the  together with a large background.

we will give in this paper a denition which completely xes the ambiguity of the mass and width denition
of a relativistic resonance or quasistationary elementary particle. this denition is based on the requirement that
the width  in the breit-wigner energy distribution should always be exactly equal to the inverse lifetime  of the
exponential decay law, i.e.,  = / . in ordinary quantum mechanics (hilbert space theory),  cannot even be dened
properly, because hilbert space mathematics does not allow the exponential law for any state evolving by a self-adjoint
hamiltonian h [19] with a semi-bounded spectrum. fermi [20] extended the integration over the energy (frequency
in his case) from the lower bound (e = e0  me + me in the present case) to e = . with this assumption for the
energy range, these hilbert space problems are overcome and the breit-wigner (e  (er  i/2))1 as well as (3)
above can be related to the exponential eiertert by a fourier transformation (but for t > 0 only). this is done
in many elementary textbooks (see e.g., equation (5.118) of [21]). though numerically the dierence between (3)
for (me + me)2  s < + and for  < s < + is small for small values of /mr ( 102  1015) just
extending e (or s) to  will violate the stability of matter condition which requires that the hilbert space be
l2(ree0>0). however, the pole at sr is in the second riemann sheet of the s-matrix, and if we take for s of (3)
the values ii < s < + in the second sheet we have avoided the conict between fermis assumption and
the semi-boundedness of the energy spectrum. this, however, means that one has to go beyond the hilbert space
l2(ree0>0). the vector with the energy distribution of (3), the gamow ket g (see (18) below), is a functional
like the dirac ket of the lippmann-schwinger equation |ei and requires the rigged hilbert space. the ideal
(that means extended to s  ii ) breit-wigner in (3) and the ideal exponential et (that means t restricted
to t > 0) are exact manifestations of the resonance or quasistable particle state, and the  of the exact exponential
law et/ = et/ is now precisely the same as the r in the exact breit-wigner (3). this is a dierent idealization
from von neumanns idealization in the (complete) hilbert space where the time dependence of the decay rate can
be approximately exponential for intermediate times [19] only and where the breit-wigner energy distribution can
only be an approximation 2. the widely accepted width-lifetime relation can in ordinary quantum mechanics only be
an approximate relation   / between approximately dened quantities  and  and has only been justied [22]
as a (weisskopf-wigner [23]) approximation.
the rigged hilbert space idealization xes  precisely as r of (3) and (7) because only r = 2 imsr (and
not z of (7) or z of (1) or any other 
z) fullls r = / and then it xes the denition of the resonance mass as
mr = resr. with the breit-wigner (3) as the ideal line shape of a relativistic resonance the location of the pole
sr could in principle be extracted precisely from the experimental data.

the problem in all these experimental analyses is to isolate the resonance from the background b(s) and from
other resonance terms of (6). this is a practical problem due to the initial and nal state photonic corrections
and the apparatus resolution, but it is also a problem of principle because even the unfolded basic cross sections
0 may contain interference with some background. one can make the argument that in principle an unstable
microphysical state cannot be isolated by a macroscopic apparatus. the prepared in-state + is a superposition (at
ideal) of a resonance state g and a background bg: + = g + bg [24]. the resonance state g is elementary
and characterized, in addition to the spin jr, by a complex square mass, sr = (mr  ir/2)2, g = g
jr sr, in the
same way as the stable state is characterized by spin j and real mass-squared m2, jm, and the vector bg represents
the non-resonant part and is something complicated that changes with + from experiment to experiment. in the
scattering amplitude it is represented by b(s). this introduces an ambiguity in the analysis of the experimental data
that allows for other theoretical denitions of mass and width. but from this one should not conclude that mass and
width of a resonance are dened as technical parameters only which could change with the renormalization scheme.
spin and mass have a fundamental meaning for stable relativistic particles and there is no reason that spin, mass

1though they still call the breit-wigner with energy dependent width (1) the better form than the breit-wigner (3) given
by the pole.
2the exact breit-wigner cannot be in the domain of the hamiltonian

and lifetime should not also have a fundamental meaning for quasistable relativistic particles, even though it is only
dened by an idealization, as long as it is the right idealization.

for stable elementary particles we have a vector space description dened by the irreducible representation spaces
of the poincare group p [25] (from which one then can construct elds [26]). this denition has so far no counterpart
for the unstable relativistic particles.
in order to consider an unstable particle such as the z-boson as a fundamental elementary particle in the wigner
sense, we want to consider in this paper a class of representations of the poincare group characterized by a complex
eigenvalue mr  i/2 of the invariant mass operator m = (pp )1/2, where mr is the mass of the unstable particle
and , its width. the state vectors of the unstable particle are by denition elements of a representation space of the
poincare group p. these representations of p are minimally complex in which the lorentz subgroup is unitary.
they are characterized by the numbers (j, sr) where j is an integer or half integer and sr = (mr  ir/2)2 is a
complex number with mr > 0 and r > 0 3. the limit case  = 0 are the unitary irreducible representations of
wigner (j, mr) describing the stable elementary particle with spin j and mass mr.

this denition by the representation (cid:0)j, mr  i r

with the second denition by the pole of the j-th partial s-matrix element at s = sr. in fact we will dene g
jsr s as
the eigenkets of the self-adjoint, invariant square mass operator pp  with generalized complex eigenvalue sr which
are connected with the s-matrix pole at s = sr. we will call these vectors relativistic gamow kets.

this denition will therefore have features that are the same as those of the pole denition. in particular, the
invariant energy wave function (as a function of s) for the resonance state g
jsr will be the breit-wigner amplitude
2
(3) (i.e., h sj|g
jsr is a
breit-wigner with maximum at s = m 2
usually one calls mz the mass of the relativistic resonance and z its width [3]. since the experiment always prepares
+ = g +bg, i.e., resonance state with a background, the s-distribution of the (corrected) cross-sections 0
j are given
by the modulus of something like (6) with an undetermined background b(s). this makes it dicult to determine
the parameters mr r accurately. in addition the complex pole position sr by itself does not dene mass and width
separately. therefore a more specic denition is needed that distinguishes between the dierent m s and s. this
is the denition by the gamow vector g
jsr, that has features in terms of which another denition of the quantity 
can be given. these features are the decay probability p(t), the total decay rate p(t), and the partial decay rates
p(t), and their exponential laws which denes the lifetime  . the time dependence of p(t),
p(t) and p(t) follow
from the time evolution of the decaying state g
j,mri/2 [27], whose time evolution, if exponential, could therefore
provide another denition of  by demanding that   
 .
these features were not discussed in connection with the z-boson and hadron resonances, because for their values
of /m they are not observable. the decay rate and the partial decay rates as functions of time are the main
focus of experimental investigations for other unstable particles with /mr  1014, like the k 0 [28]. though in
the phenomenological treatment [28,29] of decaying state vectors one is not much concerned with questions of the
relativistic denition or the exponential decay law or the line width, it would be still very satisfying if there is a precise
vector space description based on the representation (j, sr) of the relativistic space-time symmetry group p which is
compatible with the s-matrix pole denition of a relativistic resonance, and has all the desired features of a relativistic
quasistable particle. the denition of a relativistic resonance or unstable particle by g
jsr gives the meaning of a
fundamental relativistic particle to the z-boson, which can be considered as isolated from its background bg. to
what extent such an idealized ket-state can be experimentally prepared is a dierent question. the accuracy with
which the exponential law has been observed in some cases [30] shows that the isolation of the microphysical state
g from a background bg can be very good.

ago [31] in order to derive a golden rule for the time dependent decay rates p(t) which at t = 0 goes into diracs

the labels b, which could be the angular momentum j , j3, are the degeneracy quantum numbers which we shall
omit whenever possible. the dierence between (11a) and (11b) is that e for the dirac-kets is the real scattering
energy and zr for the gamow kets is the complex pole position. the conjugate operator h  of the hamiltonian h
is uniquely dened by the rst equality in (11) as the extension of the hilbert space adjoint operator h  to the space
of functionals 
4 (i.e., on the space h, the operators h  and h  are the same). we shall write (11) also in the
+
dirac way as

h |ei = e|ei ; h |z

ri = (er  i/2)|z

the dirac kets |ei in (8) are eigenkets of the unperturbed hamiltonian, h0|ei = e|ei, and ed is a discrete point
embedded in the continuous spectrum 0 < e <  of h0.

distribution in the incident beam of a scattering experiment, and the energy resolution of the observed out-state ,

where b are the degeneracy labels. if one also includes the center-of-mass motion in the description of the states,
then b will also include the center-of-mass momentum. the dirac-lippmann-schwinger kets |ei are in our rigged
hilbert space quantum theory antilinear functionals on the spaces , i.e., they are elements of the dual spaces :
|ei  

 (see e.g., sec. iii of [32]).

4for (essentially) self-adjoint h, h  is equal to (the closure of) h; but we shall use the denition (11b) also for unitary
operators u where u  is the extension of u , and not of u.

5

this leads to two rigged hilbert spaces for one and the same hilbert space h. the two rigged hilbert spaces
allow us to formulate the following new hypothesis for our quantum theory which will turn out to include asymmetric
time evolution :

the pure out-states {} of scattering theory, which are
actually observables as dened by the registration appara-
tus (detector) are vectors

the pure in-states {+} which are prepared states as de-
ned by the preparation apparatus (accelerator) are vec-
tors

(15a)

(15b)

+ given by (u+(t)) = eih

this new hypothesiswith the appropriate choice for the spaces + and  given below in (17)is essentially all by
which our quantum theory diers from the standard hilbert space quantum mechanics, which imposes the condition
{} = {+} = h (or {} = {+}  h). as a consequence of this hilbert space condition, the time evolution
generated by the self-adjoint hamiltonian h is a unitary (and therefore reversible) group evolution u (t) = eiht  <
t < +.
the time evolution in the spaces + of (15a) generated by the essentially self-adjoint hamiltonian h+ (which is
the restriction of the self-adjoint (closed) h to the dense subspace +) is not a unitary group, but only a semigroup
+ t (where the conjugate u  is dened
u+(t) = eih+t, 0  t < . the time evolution in 
as in (11)) is consequently also only a semigroup 0  t < . similar statements hold for (15b) with  < t  0. 5
this asymmetric time evolution is a consequence of the time asymmetric boundary condition (15) and not a time
asymmetry of the dynamical equation, which is still the schroedinger or von neumann dierential equation. this
time asymmetry has always been tacitly contained in the lippmann-schwinger integral equations without however
specifying the spaces 
 of the solutions |ei and without giving them an unequivocal physical interpretation as
in (15).
this quantum mechanical time asymmetry has been discussed elsewhere [32] and has been mentioned here only to
elucidate the time evolution of the gamow vectors mentioned below. the semigroup {u+(t)} is a restriction to +
of the unitary group {u (t)} in h and the semigroup {u 
+ (t)} is an extension of the same unitary group {u (t)} to

+. it is important to record that the unitary group u (t) in h is not an extension in the sense of sz.-nagy of the
semigroup u+(t) on + [33,34]. + is a complete topological space but not a hilbert space, and h is not an extension
of + as in sz.-nagy theory; rather, h results as the completion of + with respect to the scalar product norm 5.
to obtain the non-relativistic gamow kets one analytically continues the dirac-lippmann-schwinger ket |e, j, j
3 i
into the second sheet of the j-th partial s-matrix to the position of the resonance pole zr. as in ordinary scattering
theory, one starts with the following s-matrix elements (suppressing the degeneracy quantum numbers j j3) :

(16)

in order to arrive at the pole position zr of s(e), we deform the contour of integration through the cut into the lower
half of the second sheet of the energy plane. this is not possible for arbitrary elements  and + of the hilbert
space, and so one has to assume certain analyticity properties of the energy wave-functions he|i and h+e|+i
that represent (realize) the vectors , +. at this point the new rigged hilbert space hypothesis (15) comes into
play : the vectors

+|r+ are well-behaved hardy class functions [35] in the upper half plane and s h2

where s h2
|r+ are well-behaved
hardy class functions in the lower half plane. the notation |r+ means the restriction to the positive real line, i.e.,
the physical values of energy, and s denotes the schwartz space. in contrast h is realized as the space of lebesgue
square integrable functions l2[0,) = l2(r+). thus the new hypothesis (15) means that the energy wave functions
are not simply lebesgue square integrable functions 6 as in ordinary quantum mechanics but are much nicer functions
that can be analytically continued into the complex plane (lower half second sheet for h+e|+i and h|ei and
upper half second sheet for he|i and h+|e+i) and vanish on the innite semicircle suciently fast. the precise
mathematical denition [37] is not important here and it suces to say that the functions of (17) have all the properties
needed to deform the contour of integration (16) into the lower half plane second sheet and to obtain, from the integral
around the s-matrix pole zr, the following representation of the gamow vector :

this equation is understood as a functional equation in the space

function h|e, jj
7 for all   + (i.e., for observables
 only and not for in-states +  ). the integral is taken over all values of e along the real axis in the second
sheet right below the cut from e0(= 0) to , of which the values  < eii < 0 are unphysical, but for which
h|e
iii = h|ei for the physical values of e along the upper edge of the cut in the rst sheet, 0  e < . as a
consequence of the hardy class property, h|zi for any z in the lower half plane is already determined by its values

function. the representation (18) is the reason why we have a breit-wigner
that extends over  < e < +,
in spite of the fact that the physical values (i.e., the spectrum of the self-adjoint h) are bounded from below. the
same will hold for the relativistic breit-wigner in (3).

all the features described here for the non-relativistic case carry over directly to the relativistic case if one replaces
the energy (in the center-of-mass frame) e by the relativistic invariant mass square variable (mandelstam variable)
2 = (p1 + p2 + + pn)2 where p1 , p2  are the momenta of the (two) decay products r. the problem that
s = e2 p
remains to solve is what to do about the momentum p which becomes complex when s is taken to complex values.

since in the non-relativistic physics changing of p (galilei transformation into a moving frame) does not eect e but
only p
2m , an analytic extension of e to complex values z does not lead to complex momenta. this is not the case for
lorentz transformations. complex values of s = pp also means complex values of etot = p0 and pm , m = 1, 2, 3 ;
because lorentz transformations intermingle energy and momenta.
in order to stay as closely as possible to the
non-relativistic case we will consider a special class of minimally complex irreducible representations of p. our

6one can show [36] that the two triplets of function spaces

which realize the two triplets of abstract vector spaces (15), are two rigged hilbert spaces (also called gelfand triplets) of
functions. the two rigged hilbert spaces of the in-states {+} and the out-states {} are mathematically dened as those
rigged hilbert spaces whose realizations are the two rigged hilbert spaces of s  h2

construction will lead to complex momenta p, but these momenta will be minimally complex in such a way that
the 4-velocities p  p
m remain real. this construction is motivated by a remark of d. zwanziger [38] and is based on
the fact that the 4-velocity eigenvectors |pj3(m, j)i furnish as valid a basis for the representation space of p as the
usual wigner basis of momentum eigenvectors |pj3(m, j)i. when used properly as basis vectors, their introduction
does not constitute an approximation. the |p, j3i   are the eigenkets of the 4-velocity operators p = pm 1 and
j3 (p)  hj3 p|i represents the 4-velocity distribution of a state vector  for a particle with spin j and mass m and
therewith contains the same information as the standard momentum distribution hp|i. the 4-velocity eigenvectors
are often more useful as basis vectors than the momentum eigenvectors [39].

iii. relativistic gamow vectors.

relativistic resonances occur in the scattering of relativistic elementary particles, and relativistic quasistationary
states decay into two (or more) relativistic particles, e.g., ee  r  f f (f = e, ). relativistic resonances and
decaying states are described in the direct product space of two (or more) irreducible representations of the poincare
group [40,41]

h  h(m1, 0)  h(m2, 0) =z 

(m1+m2)2

h(s, j) .

(20)

for simplicity, we have assumed here that there are two decay products, r  f1 + f2 with spin zero, described by
the irreducible representation spaces hfi (mi, ji = 0). the direct sum resolution for the more general case involving
arbitrary spin j1 and j2 is treated in [42]. since the relativistic gamow vectors will be dened not as momentum
eigenvectors but as 4-velocity eigenvectors in the unitary irreducible representation spaces of the direct product of (20)
one needs to use the basis vectors | piji3(miji)i and | pj3(wj)i with the normalization

(21)

a relativistic resonance occurs in a particular partial wave characterized by its spin value j. therefore one cannot
use the direct product basis vectors

but the basis in which the total angular momentum or resonance spin j is diagonal. these are the kets |pj3(wj)i
which are also eigenvectors of the 4-velocity operators

since the direct product space (20) describes the states of asymptotically free decay products, the basis vectors (25)
are the eigenvectors of the free hamiltonian h0 = p 1

from these free states, the dirac-lippmann-schwinger scattering states involving interactions can be obtained, in
analogy to (13) (cf. also [26] sec. 3.1) by:

h 

0 |pj3(wj)i = e|pj3(wj)i, e = wq1 + p

2.

(29)

where  are the mller operators. for the basis vectors at rest, (30) is given by the solution of the lippmann-
schwinger equation

|pj3(wj)i = |pj3(wj)i

(30)

|0j3(wj)i =(cid:18)1 +

w  h  i

v(cid:19)|0j3(wj)i.

the interacting states |0j3(wj)i are eigenvectors of the exact hamiltonian h = h0 + v :

h |0j3(wj)i = s|0j3(wj)i,

(m1 + m2)2  s < .

(31)

(32)

for arbitrary velocities, the vectors |pj3(wj)i are obtained from the basis vectors at rest |0j3(wj)i by the boost
(rotation-free lorentz transformation) u(l(p)) whose parameters are the 4-velocities p. the generators of the lorentz
transformations are the interaction-incorporating observables

p0 = h, p m, j .

(33)

these exact generators of the poincare group are related to the free generators of (20) by terms that describe the
interactions ( [26], sec. 3.3). for any xed pair of values [jw], the basis vectors | pj3(wj)i, or equivalently the
|0j3(wj)i when boosted by u (l(p)), span a unitary irreducible representation space of the poincare group with the
exact generators (33). the relativistic gamow vector describing the unstable particle derives from these interaction-
incorporating lippmann-schwinger kets | pj3(wj)i.
as mentioned above, the unstable particle is that physical entity which gives rise to the simple pole at sr =
(mr  i r
2 )2 on the second sheet of the analytically extended partial wave s-matrix sjr. therefore, to obtain
the gamow vectors, and therewith a state vector description of unstable particles, we seek to obtain the analytic
extensions of the dirac-lippmann-schwinger kets (30) or (31) to the location of the pole sr. this requirement
imposes the condition that the wave functions of the in-states +   and out-states   + have the same
analyticity properties in the square mass variable as the energy wave functions of the non-relativistic case synopsized
by (17), with the exception that mathematical rigor requires that a closed subspace s of the schwartz space, developed
in [44], needs to be considered :

(34)

(m1+m2)2

where r(m1+m2)2 = [(m1 + m2)2,). the details of this construction of s will be given in a forthcoming paper.
another requirement for the validity of the analytic continuation is that the s-contour of integration in the completeness
relation for (, +) with respect to the |pj3 sji basis, namely

(m1+m2)2

dsh|pj3 sjisj (s)hpj3 sj+|+i

(35)

can be deformed into the second sheet of the jr-th partial s-matrix element sj(e). with these analyticity require-
ments, and in complete analogy to the non-relativistic case (18), one deforms the s-contour of integration in (35) so
that the amplitude (, +) separates into a resonance state associated with the pole at sr and a background term.
the pole term yields the kets

with the breit-wigner s-distribution of (3) that extends from ii < s < . these are the relativistic gamow kets
that we set out to construct.
the relativistic gamow kets (36) are generalized eigenvectors of the invariant mass squared operator m 2 = pp

(37)

to prove (37) from (36) and also in order to obtain (36) from the pole term of the s-matrix, one needs to use the
hardy class properties (34) of the space + [31] and the usual analyticity properties of the s-matrix elements [13].

olution (36), they also have a breit-wigner distribution

2 (cid:1)2
it is important to remark here that the complexness of the poincare invariant pp  =(cid:0)sr  i r
that of the momenta p =(cid:0)sr  i r

2 (cid:1) p, does not upset the unitarity of the u(). the crucial observation is that the

parameters of the homogeneous lorentz transformations (40) are not the momenta p, but the 4-velocities p = p

since the boost matrix l is given by

(41)

we choose these parameters p real and they remain real under general lorentz transformations which are products
of boosts and ordinary rotations. the complexness of the momenta is solely due to complexness of the invariant mass
w = sr.

the analyticity and smoothness properties (34) needed for the construction of the rigged hilbert space theory of
non-relativistic gamow vectors further infer that the time translation of the decaying state is given by a semigroup.
for instance, the rest state vectors of the quasistable particle transforms as

eiht|p = 0, j3(srjr)i = eimrtert/2|p = 0, j3(srjr)i for t  0 only

(42)

10

where t is time in the rest system. this is the required exponential time evolution which assures the validity of the
exact exponential law for the partial and total decay rates

p(t) =

d
dtp(t) =

r


eirt/ ;

p(t) =



eirt/ ; t  0 ,

(43)

where r is exactly the imaginary part of the generalized eigenvalue of the mass operator m for the gamow kets

in (37) which in turn according to (36) is exactly 2imsr of the pole position sr in the ideal breit-wigner (3). the

relativistic gamow vector is the theoretical link that connects the ideal relativistic breit-wigner energy distribution
of the second sheet s-matrix pole (3) to the exact exponential decay law (43) and justies the lifetime-width relation
 = 
r

as a precise equality.

iv. conclusion.

we have constructed the relativistic gamow vector in analogy to the non-relativistic gamow vector which had
been dened some time ago in the framework of time asymmetric quantum mechanics in rigged hilbert spaces.
gamow vectors have all the properties needed to represent quasistable states and resonances. they are associated to
resonance poles of the s-matrix, have a breit-wigner energy distribution which for the relativistic gamow vector is
given by (36) leading to the scattering amplitude (3), and have an exact exponential time evolution (42) guaranteeing
the exponential law (43). then the connection between the width r measured by (3) and the lifetime  = 
r
measured by the exponential law (43) holds exactly. this relation  = 
 cannot be obtained from (1) for  = z
since the denition of the gamow vectors (36) requires the denominator of (3). it is quite unlikely that a state vector
(or state operator) can be associated to (1) since the hardy class rigged hilbert spaces (34), from which the gamow
vector (36) is derived, have a very special and tight mathematical structure.

if one wants this lifetime-width relation,  = 

 , to hold universally and exactly, then  must be the r dened
by (3) and not the more commonly used z of (7) nor the standard z of (1). the resonance mass is then given
from the inverse lifetime r and the s-matrix pole position sr as resr = mr which diers from the standard
mz  mr + 26 mev and from mz  mr + 8 mev.
dening the relativistic resonance and quasistable relativistic particle by the gamow vector puts the quasistable
and stable elementary particles on a more equal footing. stable elementary particles are dened by irreducible unitary
representation (j, m2) spaces of the poincare group p [25]. the dirac-lippmann-schwinger kets | pj3(sj)i in (30)
are basis vectors of an irreducible unitary representation (j, s) of p [26]. the gamow kets | pj3(srj)i take this just
one small step further because they are obtained from the out-states | pj3(sj)i by analytic continuation to the
s-matrix pole position sr. the gamow kets | pj3(srj)i are also a basis system of a representation (j, sr) of poincare
transformations. but these transformations form only the semigroup of the poincare transformations into the forward
light cone p+, of which the time translations at rest for t > 0, (42), are special examples. the representations
(j, sr) = (cid:0)j, mr  i r
2 (cid:1) of p+ are minimally complex representations in which the lorentz subgroup is unitary.
they are characterized by the integer or half-integer j and by mr > 0 and r > 0. the limit case r = 0 are the
unitary irreducible representation of wigner (j, mr) describing the stable elementary particle with spin j and mass
mr, and thus quasistable and stable particles are just special cases of representations of poincare transformations8.
the relativistic gamow vectors unify stable and quasistable relativistic particles; the z-boson now becomes a
fundamental particle in the sense of wigner, like the proton. stable particles are representations characterized by a
real mass and have unitary group time evolutions. quasistable and resonance particles are semigroup representations
characterized by a complex mass and have semigroup time evolutions. this time asymmetry on the microphysical
level is the most surprising and remarkable property of relativistic gamow vectors.

we gratefully acknowledge valuable support from the welch foundation and from conacyt (mexico).
