abstract

a crucial element of scattering theory and the lsz reduction formula is the
assumption that the coupling vanishes at large times. this is known not to
hold for the theories of the standard model and in general such asymptotic
dynamics is not well understood. we give a description of asymptotic dynamics in
eld theories which incorporates the important features of weak convergence and
physical boundary conditions. applications to theories with three and four point
interactions are presented and the results are shown to be completely consistent
with the results of perturbation theory.

1 introduction

descriptions of scattering in quantum eld theory assume that at large times the par-
ticles are widely separated and behave like free particles. this assumption, which
underlies the lsz formalism, is incorrect for many theories. the most obvious exam-
ple of this is when the incoming or outgoing system includes bound states, but it also
fails if the physics is characterised by long range interactions. since most of the physics
of the standard model falls into at least one of these categories (conned quarks, mass-
less gauge bosons) it is very important to have a precise understanding of the dynamics
of quantum eld theories at large times.

generally, then, it is assumed that at asymptotic times the heisenberg elds become

free ones

and similarly for t  . we should note that this behaviour can only be taken to
hold as a weak limit, between matrix elements, since otherwise (see sect. 5-1-2 of [1])
one can show, from the kallen-lehmann representation, that the elds are free at all
times.

the limit in (1) is sometimes discussed in the framework of an adiabatic approxi-
mation, in which the coupling constant is taken to be multiplied by a function which
is one during the scattering process and approaches zero for very large (positive or neg-
ative) times. this is unsatisfactory since it assumes the desired answer which ought
rather to emerge from the theory itself. it can also be wrong, as in the case of quantum
electrodynamics (qed).

qed, the paradigm for the standard model, has long range interactions. the
masslessness of the photon means that the potential between static charges falls o
only as 1/r. it has been known for a long time [2, 3] that this means that (1) does
not hold and that any attempt to impose such a relation generates infra-red (ir)
divergences in the wave-function renormalisation constant of (charged) matter elds.
this has been studied [4] in the relativistic theory by kulish and faddeev (kf) and
their general approach to asymptotic dynamics has been utilised by various authors,
see, e.g., [513]. we shall now give a brief sketch of the procedure adopted by kf and
what their results seem to indicate for qed.

they considered the usual qed interaction hamiltonian

hint(t) = ez d3x a(t, x)j (t, x) ,

(2)

where j (t, x) = (t, x)(t, x) is the (conserved) matter current. in order to carry
out the lsz reduction of the s-matrix we must be in the interaction picture so that,
although the time evolution of the states is determined by (2), the evolution of the
elds themselves is given by the free hamiltonian. one may then insert the free eld
expansions in (2). these plane wave expansions are

(x) =z d3p

(2)3

1

2ep (cid:8)b(p, s)us(p)eipx + d(p, s)vs(p)eipx(cid:9)

where the notation implies a sum over the s indices. working in feynman gauge we
have

(3)

(4)

a(x) =z d3k

(2)3

1

2k (cid:8)a(k)eikx + a

(k)eikx(cid:9) ,

where k0 = ep = p|p|2 + m2 and k = |k|. inserting these into (2) results in eight

terms which may be grouped according to the positive and negative frequency compo-
nents of the elds. each of these pieces will have a time dependence of the form eit
where  involves sums and dierences of energy terms.

kf claimed that, for |t|  , only terms with  tending to zero contribute to the
asymptotic dynamics. since the spatial integration in (2) generates a momentum delta
function, only four terms with  = (ep+k  ep  k) would then have a large t-limit.
this vanishing of ep+k  ep  k  0 can only take place in qed because the photon
is massless, and it only occurs for soft photons, i.e., for k  0. this is in accord
with perturbation theory: the breakdown of the s-matrix occurs for soft photons and
giving the photon a small mass acts as a cut-o on these divergences. an asymptotic

2

approximation to (2) is obtained from the lowest order term of the taylor expansion,
in powers of k, of the hamiltonian. this yields

as(t, x)

int(t) = ez d3x a(t, x)j

according to kf therefore, the asymptotic hamiltonian is the integral over all momenta
of the current associated with a charged particle of velocity p/ep. this non-vanishing
hamiltonian nds its perturbative expression in the branch cuts, rather than poles, in
the on-shell greens functions in the matter elds of qed. an attractive aspect of this
theory is that it completely dispenses with the adiabatic approximation. although this
discussion seems to pick up the problems in applying the lsz scheme to qed and, in
particular, correctly identies the problem with long wavelength (k  0) photons, it
cannot be regarded as the end of the story.
these arguments are used extensively in other theories, such as qcd, where the
physics is not well understood, and where greater reliance is put on the mathematics.
on the other hand the theory is employed at the level of operators whereas it is more
appropriate, in quantum eld theories, to work at the level of matrix elements and weak
limits. the kf approach also makes no connection between the large time limit and the
separation of particles at large distance. as we shall see below, the naive application
of this approach to massive 4 theory would indicate that the lsz formalism should
also break down, which it very evidently does not.

this paper is concerned with constructing a new approach to asymptotic dynamics
within the context of weak convergence, and with appropriate physical boundary con-
ditions corresponding to the separation of particles. we will apply it to a variety of
interactions and show that it yields results which are completely consistent with what
is known from explicit perturbative calculations.

in sect. 2 we will show that the kf argument cannot be applied to four point inter-
actions. sect. 3, which is the heart of this paper, develops the method for massive 4
theory and then applies it to both the three and four point interactions of scalar qed.
in this way we will see both the well known spin independence of the ir structure
in the abelian theory with massive charges and, for the three point vertex, regain the
results of [4]. a discussion of the implications of these results for perturbative calcu-
lations in the standard model is presented in sect. 4. some technical details are given
in appendices.

2 four point interactions

as we have indicated in the introduction, there are objections to the kf view of
asymptotic dynamics: rstly, that the statements have been framed specically for the

3

picture of the k  0 infra-red theory, which is well known to suer from divergences,
and not as a general statement on the behaviour of asymptotic limits; secondly, and
more critically, that the prescription does not translate to other quantum eld theories.
it is the latter objection which is the most serious and the one which we shall now
demonstrate.

to be precise, we shall show that the kf argument applied to the case of massive 4
theory is not sucient to show that the asymptotic limit of the coupling term vanishes.
however, 4 theory is the standard textbook example of an interacting quantum eld
theory and its perturbation theory is straightforward  the coupling must vanish for
well separated particles .

to begin then, let us take the standard free eld expansion of the scalar eld

(x) =z d3k

(2)3

1

2ek (cid:0)a(k)eikx + a(k)eikx(cid:1) ,

(8)

(9)

with ek =p|k|2 + m2 and m the mass of the particle. the commutator relations are

[a(k) , a(k)] = (2)3 2ek 3(k  k)

and the interaction part of the hamiltonian for the theory under consideration is then

hint =



4!z d3x : 4(x , t) : ,

(10)

where the : : indicates normal ordering.

when the expansion (8) is inserted into (10) and the resulting expression is sim-
plied, then, after normal ordering, it will be found to consist of twelve terms, each
of which has an exponential term where the exponent is made up of sums and dier-
ences of the energy eigenvalues. some of these exponents are obviously non-vanishing.
according to the methods of kf which were described in the introduction, the inte-
grals containing these exponentials may be ignored. however, not all of the integrals
involved have exponents which are so easily dealt with and one of these, which we shall
now consider, is

z d3p d3q d3k

(2)9

a(k)a(p + q  k)a(p)a(q)

2ep2eq2ek2ep+qk

eit(ep+eqekep+qk) .

(11)

applying the methods described in the introduction, any non-vanishing asymptotic
dynamics will come from those terms and those momenta for which the exponent
vanishes. to this end we must determine if the equation

ep + eq  ek  ep+qk = 0

(12)

has any solutions.

far from this being a dicult problem, upon reection it becomes obvious that there
are innitely many solutions! this is most easily seen by noting that the problem is
equivalent to that of nding solutions to the simultaneous system of equations

p|p|2 + m2 +p|q|2 + m2 = p|k|2 + m2 +p|l|2 + m2

p + q = k + l .

(13)

figure 1: triangle of momenta

the incoming and outgoing momenta must have some connection with a scattering
process so that the obvious, trivial solutions, which can be found by taking, say, q =
l = 0, will be ignored.

referring to fig. 1, let p =


bc . now imagine pivoting the rigid
triangle abc, with the line ac as the hinge, to get a new triangle which is congruent

to abc . if the new triangle is abc then take k =
bc . the vectors
p, q, k, l then automatically satisfy both the conditions of (13).

ab and l =

one can do this with any two non-parallel vectors, for example (with m = 1) take

p = (1, 1, 0), q = (1,1, 0), k = (1, 1/2, 1/2), l = (1,1/2,1/2) . another
example is p = (4/3, 22/3, 0), q = 0, k = (2/3,2/3, 1), and l = p+qk .

no physical meaning could be given to such an arbitrary set of momenta. following
the arguments of kf however, we conclude that the existence of this wide range of
momenta for which (12) vanishes, indicates that the asymptotic dynamics of the system
is determined by this set of points. this would suggest that problems could arise in
the associated perturbation theory for massive 4 theory, and this is well known to be
false for this textbook example of a quantum eld theory.

at this point we wish to stress that this apparent contradiction has implications
beyond this simple example as there are many important quantum eld theories, such
as qcd and the higgs mechanism, in which four point interactions have a major role.
if there is a deciency in the understanding of the asymptotic dynamics in this simple
scalar four point theory then it is dicult to see how one might proceed on this basis,
with any condence, in other theories of the standard model. it is clear from this that
the kf argument needs considerable renement if it is to be applied to the standard
model.

3 general approach to asymptotic dynamics

the major aw in the kf argument is its reliance on strong operator convergence.
instead of concentrating on the hamiltonian itself, we shall focus our attention on
matrix elements. the limits we shall consider are weak limits and this is in keeping
with the lsz formalism in quantum eld theories.

if in represents an incoming wave packet in this scattering experiment and out is
an outgoing wave packet, then the matrix element of interest is <
out|hint|in>. this
is a time dependent c-number and the elementary notion of convergence may be adopted
in the investigation of its asymptotic limit. in the case of massive scalar 4 it will be
shown that, under conditions which have a straightforward physical interpretation, its

5

asymptotic limit is zero.

this section is organised as follows. in sect. 3.1 we shall use massive 4 theory
as a vehicle to study asymptotic dynamics. having established the basic method and
shown that it is consistent with what is already known for 4 theory, we shall then
employ it to determine the asymptotic dynamics of scalar qed.

there is a particularly interesting feature of scalar qed which makes the study of its
asymptotic dynamics worthwhile. the interaction hamiltonian in scalar qed consists
of a sum of two terms, a three point interaction term, similar to that in (fermionic)
qed, and a four point interaction term, which has no parallel in qed, so that the
dynamics of scalar qed is richer than that of fermionic qed. from perturbation
theory it is known that (fermionic) qed and scalar qed have the same infra-red
problems, so their asymptotic dynamics are the same. perturbation theory also tells
us that the four point interaction term is divergence free so it must have vanishing
asymptotic dynamics. we would expect this to emerge, in a natural manner, from any
satisfactory theory which describes the asymptotic dynamics of scalar qed. further,
since the infra-red problem is spin independent, the asymptotic dynamics of the three
point interaction will, with the obvious changes, be the same in either fermionic or
scalar qed.

we shall begin our examination of scalar qed in sect. 3.2 with the quartic term,
which turns out to be the easier to deal with. we shall show that its asymptotic
dynamics is similar to that of the scalar 4 theory and has a zero limit. after this, in
sect. 3.3, we shall turn our attention to the cubic term and the infra-red problem. we
shall prove that the asymptotic dynamics for the infra-red problem is exactly the same
as that for a system in which the hamiltonian is derived from a current associated with
a moving charged particle with known, non-trivial asymptotic dynamics.

3.1 scalar 4 theory

consider the following incoming and outgoing wave packets.

in = z d3r d3w f (r)g(w)a(r)a(w)|0> ,
out = z d3u d3v h(u)i(v)a(u)a(v)|0> ,

(14)

with the functions f, g, h, i being test functions for the wave packets. referring to (8),
(9), (10), and the expressions (14), one nds that <
out|hint|in> reduces to a single
integral which is proportional to

z d3p d3q d3k h(k)i(p + q  k)f (p)g(q)eit ,
with the exponent  having the value  = ep + eq  ek  ep+qk .
notice that the exponent in this term has essentially the same structure as the
term in (11) which appeared to cause problems when applying the methods of kf.
the dierence now is that (15) is a straightforward integral and not an operator, so
that elementary methods may be applied to nd the asymptotic limit. the machinery

(15)

6

we shall employ is the method of stationary phase [14]. briey, this says that, provided
there is no point in the region of integration at which all of the rst order partial
derivatives of  are zero, then the integral (15) tends to zero as |t|   .
the terms in  have the form el =p|l|2 + m2 and, since m 6= 0, they will all have
rst-order partial derivatives for all values of l. the rst order derivatives of  are then
given by


pi


qj

pi
ep 
qj
eq 
kn
ek 

pi + qi  ki

ep+qk

pj + qj  kj

ep+qk

pn + qn  kn

ep+qk

.

(16)

if at some point all of these are zero then, in particular, /pi = /qj = 0
for all possible values of i, j . this implies that p/ep = (p + q  k)/ep+qk and
q/eq = (p + q  k)/ep+qk so we must also have p/ep = q/eq . if we can exclude the
set of points for which this condition holds from the domain of integration, then the
integral in (15) will vanish as |t|   .
in (15), the test functions f, g for the the incoming wave packet have the variables
p, q as arguments. the expressions p/ep and q/eq represent the velocities of the
respective incoming wave packet. experimentally, scattering is prepared by setting up
the apparatus in such a way that the two beams of particles are brought together from
dierent directions, i.e., with dierent velocities. this information can be incorporated
into the incoming wave packet by ensuring that the supports of the test functions
exclude the possibility that p/ep = q/eq . the precise statement of the requirement is
that the test functions f, g must have non-overlapping supports in velocity space. this
condition on the test functions, of having non-overlapping supports in velocity space,
is central to the construction of the s-matrix (see sect. 13.4 of [15]).

to restate, if the test functions f, g have non-overlapping supports in velocity space
then the integral in (15) vanishes as |t|   . this is exactly the behaviour that
one would expect for this particular scattering process but a further question remains
to be answered: what constraints does this choice of test functions for the incoming
wave packet impose on the outgoing wave packet? if this picture is to display all of
the features of this particular scattering process then some combinations of outgoing
particles must be excluded. the outgoing particles must behave as free particles at
asymptotically large times which means that, as was the case for the incoming wave
packets, their test functions must also have non-overlapping support in velocity space.
however, this must be a consequence of the condition imposed on the test functions
for the incoming wave packet and not an independently imposed condition.

the arguments of the test functions for the outgoing wave packet are p + q k and
k, and the equality of these two variables is equivalent to p+q = 2k. this is simply the
expression of conservation of momentum. another principle in any scattering theory is
conservation of energy. in this case this is expressed as ep + eq = 2ek . finally then,
we must show that the two conditions

p + q = 2k ,

7

ep + eq = 2ek ,

(17)

are incompatible with the functions f, g having non-overlapping support in velocity
space. since the masses of the two incoming particles are equal, the equation p/ep =
q/eq is equivalent to p = q and non-overlapping in velocity space is equivalent to
non-overlapping in momentum space. in this case we need to show that if p 6= q then
the conditions of (17) are impossible.
again, for simplicity, let us take the mass m = 1 . the rst equation in (17) means
that the vectors p, q, k, are coplanar. in that case, we may choose a unit vector n
orthogonal to this plane and write p = p + n, q = q + n, k = k + n . since n is

orthogonal to the plane of p, we have |p| =p|p|2 + 1 = ep, with similar expressions

for q, k . this means that (17) may now be written as

p + q = 2k

|p| + |q| = 2|k| .

(18)

from the triangle inequality we know that this is only possible when p and q are
if there is a number  such that p = q . in terms of p, q and n, this
parallel, i.e.
can be rearranged into the form p  q = (1  )n . the only solution for this is with
 = 1 so that p = q .
there are other possible matrix elements that are associated with the four point
interaction term. there is the possibility that the incoming wave packet consists of a
single eld, with the outgoing wave packet made up of three elds, and there is the
reverse. both of these cases may be treated in precisely the same manner as the above
case, and with precisely the same conclusions. we omit the details.

3.2 scalar qed: the four point interaction.

the interaction in scalar qed is more complicated than that of qed due to the
existence of the extra term representing a four point interaction. in this section we
shall study the asymptotic properties associated with this term and show that it has
trivial asymptotic dynamics. this will require extending our techniques since we shall
have to deal with wave packets which have massless particles as an essential part of
their structure.

the method of stationary phase that was used to determine the limit of (15), in
sect. 3.1, was dependent upon some of the properties of the partial derivatives (16) of
the various energy eigenvalues. in the case of massless particles the energy eigenvalues,
which are of the form k = |k|, are not dierentiable at the origin but this will not be
a barrier to the application of this technique.
we begin by writing out the full, normal ordered interaction hamiltonian for scalar

qed, which is

with : : being normal ordering and where the current j  is given by

hint(t) = ez d3x : j (x)a(x) :

j  = i(  )  egiai

(19)

(20)

with the obvious meaning given to the components of j  dened in (20).

we shall work in feynman gauge and take the plane wave expansions given by

(x) = z d3p

2ep (cid:0)a(p)eipx + b(p)eipx(cid:1)

(a(k)eikx + a

(k)eikx)

the commutator for the photon is given by

[a(p), a

(q)] = (2)32kg3(p  q) .

(21)

(22)

when (21) is substituted into (19) and rearranged, the quartic interaction will be
found to consist of 12 terms, each of them with diering exponential terms corre-
sponding to the dierent possible interactions. we shall consider the matrix element
represented by the following diagram.

we shall take as our wave packets the following expressions

in = z d3r d3w f (r)b(r) c(w)a
out = z d3u d3v g(u)b(u) h(v)a

(w)|0> ,

(v)|0> ,

(23)

where the f, c, g, h are the respective test functions. one then nds that the ampli-
tude <
2 , which is an integral
proportional to

out | hint(t)| in> is a single term, constructed from j 
z d3p d3q d3k ci(p)hi(q)g(k)f (k + q  p)eit,

where  = p + ek+qp  ek  q .
notice that the einstein summation convention means that this integral is actually
a sum of three integrals, with i = 1, 2, 3. the incoming and outgoing charged elds
must be separated, i.e., the test functions f and g must have disjoint support. if not,
then, by conservation of momentum, there will be no separation of the incoming and
outgoing photons. in that case, no scattering will have taken place. thus it must follow
that, for each i, the test functions ci, hi must have disjoint support so that at least one
of them will not have the zero vector in its support. without loss of generality, let us
suppose that this is ci.

(24)

9

the function  will then have continuous partial derivatives in p, k and these are

given by


pi


kj

=

=

pi
p 

ki + qi  pi

ek+qp

kj + qj  pj

ek+qp 

kj

.

(25)

the vanishing of these expressions for all i, j would then imply that p/p = k/ek which
is impossible, since the former is a unit vector while the latter is not. the method of
stationary phase (applied only to the variables p, k) can again be used to prove that
(24) will vanish as |t|   .
there are other possible scattering events that are described by this four point
interaction hamiltonian, e.g., when the wave packets consist of two incoming photons
and two outgoing charges (or vice versa). if the photons are separated according to our
scheme (their test functions have disjoint support), then a similar exercise will show
that this picture also gives rise to vanishing asymptotic dynamics.

3.3 scalar qed: the infra-red approximation

the cubic term in the interaction hamiltonian (19), which comes from the j 
1 term in
(20), is made up of two parts, j 
12 . these two terms are similar in their structure
and both contribute to the problem of infra-red divergences. we shall consider only
the rst of these, j 

12 being substantially the same.

11 and j 

11, the results for j 

as in qed, the infra-red problem in scalar qed occurs in relation to a scattering

process in which an incoming charged particle emits a photon.

we shall consider the case when the wave packets are given by

in = z d3y f (y)b(y)| 0>
out = z d3u d3v g(u)b(u) h(v)a

(v)| 0> .

the matrix element will then be found to be given by

<

out | hint(t)| in>= ez d3q d3kf (q + k)g(q)qh(k)eit

(26)

(27)

where  = eq+k  eq  k . now it is easy to see why the previous method cannot be
applied in this case. since the photon is massless, the corresponding energy eigenvalue

10

is k = |k|. the expression for , therefore, will not have partial derivatives in ki at
|k| = 0, and the partial derivatives in qj will vanish when |k| = 0, for any value of q.
it is this regime, when |k| = 0, which gives rise to the problem of infra-red divergences
and the diculties associated with its asymptotic dynamics cannot be avoided.
following kf we shall compare the asymptotic dynamics of this scattering process

with that governed by the scalar version of the asymptotic hamiltonian (5).

the system that we shall take for our comparison is then the one dened the

asymptotic current given by

j 

as(x) = iz d3q

(2)3 (cid:18) 1

2eq(cid:19)2

b(q)b(q)q3(x 

q
eq

t) ,

(28)

where we omit terms which do not contribute to this matrix element. the interaction
hamiltonian is given by

int = ez d3x j 
has

as(x) a(x) .

(29)

if we take the incoming and outgoing wave packets (26) and contract, in the usual

int(t) then we obtain the amplitude

fashion, with has
<

int(t)| in>= ez d3q d3kf (q)g(q)qh(k)eit ,

out |has
where  = q  k/eq  k .
the asymptotic dynamics of the systems dened by the interaction hamiltonians
(19) and (29), and the wave packets (26), will then be the same if we can prove that the
dierence between the integrals in (27) and (30) vanish for asymptotically large time.
this amounts to showing the following theorem whose proof is given in the appendix.

(30)

theorem 1 let f, g, h, ,  be dened as in (27) and (30). then

lim

tz d3q d3k[f (q + k)eit  f (q)eit]g(q)qh(k) = 0 .

(31)

this shows that the physics of scattering in scalar qed at large times is fully described
by the asymptotic hamiltonian (29). the four point interaction vanishes and the three
point one can be described using the simple current (28). we have thus extended
the results of kf to scalar qed and proved the spin independence of the asymptotic
dynamics in abelian gauge theories.

4 conclusions

it is not necessary to assume that the coupling constant asymptotically switches o.
as we have seen, one can, for theories like massive 4, prove that the asymptotic dy-
namics is free or, for theories like qed, with rather more eort, determine the form of
this asymptotic interaction. the arguments for determining the asymptotic properties
of interactions in quantum eld theories, proposed by kulish and fadeev [4], have been

11

improved upon and made applicable to a more general type of interaction, including
four point couplings. the principle renement of our approach to the asymptotic dy-
namics is that we examine the asymptotic properties of matrix elements corresponding
to specic interactions rather than considering operators. this has the advantage of
requiring only the machinery for the convergence of sequences of c-numbers rather than
the more elaborate needs of operator convergence.

in the case of 4 theory it was found that, when the incoming wave packet had test
functions with non-overlapping supports in velocity space, the asymptotic interaction
hamiltonian is weakly vanishing. this condition on the test functions, of having non-
overlapping support in velocity space, is exactly that which is required in the lsz
formalism and the construction of the s-matrix. our result is in complete agreement
with perturbation theory and shows why it works.

in the case of scalar qed we used our methods to show that the matrix elements
associated with the four point interaction term are all asymptotically trivial which is
again in line with the results of perturbation theory. for the three point interaction
term of scalar qed, our methods show how the asymptotic dynamics associated with
the event of a charged particle emitting a photon can be shown to be exactly the same
as that of a charged particle with known non-trivial asymptotic dynamics, and this
conformed to the approximation given by kf. the spin independence of this result
immediately translates to the fermionic theory.

what can we learn from this work about qed? firstly that the coupling does not
switch o at large times. kf further showed that this implies that the lagrangian
matter eld does not asymptotically approach the free eld of the plane wave expansion.
rather there is a distortion factor which expresses itself in perturbation theory in the
branch cuts (instead of poles) in the matter eld two point function. they drew
the conclusion from this that it is not possible to describe charged particles in qed.
although this paper supports the non-vanishing of the interaction, we feel that this last
conclusion is not justied. what one needs is to nd the elds which do asymptotically
approach the plane wave expansion and can therefore be interpreted as particles. (it is
in fact clear from the start that the lagrangian matter cannot hope to do this since it
is not gauge invariant.) that such elds exist has been shown elsewhere [16] and that
their greens functions have a good pole structure has been amply demonstrated, see,
e.g., [1719]. these are the physical elds which should be identied with the charged
particles seen in experiment.

we would like to suggest here three further areas for study: massless qed is a
theory with collinear divergences and as such a playground for understanding qcd.
the asymptotic dynamics of this theory [20] requires further study, in particular the
physical asymptotic elds need to be constructed. finite temperature eld theory is
another area where infra-red divergences are important, here, of course, the residual
asymptotic dynamics of zero temperature will be acerbated by excitations from the
heat bath. finally in qcd connement shows that the interaction does not switch
o and the strong interaction between quarks and gluons is indeed supposed to grow
with the separation. the application of the methods of asymptotic dynamics and the
construction of physical elds at short distances [21,22] could have implications for jets
production. it has though been demonstrated that there is a topological obstruction to
the construction of an isolated quark or gluon [22], how this relates to non-perturbative
eects in the asymptotic dynamics of qcd is a topic for future work.

a appendix

in this section we shall provide a proof of theorem 1. this is split into two parts: first
we shall show that the two integrals

z d3q d3kf (q)g(q)qh(k)eit

and

z d3q d3kf (q + k)g(q)qh(k)eit

are asymptotically equivalent. then we shall show that the two integrals

z d3q d3kf (q + k)g(q)qh(k)eit

and

z d3q d3kf (q + k)g(q)qh(k)eit

are asymptotically equivalent. together, they give the proof of the theorem. the rst
of these results is

lemma 1 let f, g, h,  be as dened in (30). then the two integrals

z d3q d3kf (q)g(q)qh(k)eit
have the same asymptotic limit, i.e., if it is dened by

and

z d3q d3kf (q + k)g(q)qh(k)eit

it =z d3q d3k [f (q + k)  f (q)]g(q)qh(k)eit

then it  0 as |t|  .
proof we rst take a xed value of q and consider

it(q) =z d3k [f (q + k)  f (q)]qh(k)eit .

(32)

(33)

(34)

this integral is clearly well dened and there is a a positive number m, say, such that

r d3k |qh(k)| < m .
now given  > 0, choose a  > 0 such that |f (q + k)  f (q)| < 
2m if |k| <  . let
u1 = {k : |k| < } and u2 = {k : |k| > /2} and let 1, 2 be a smooth partition of
unity subordinate to u1, u2 respectively. write

t (q) =z d3k 1(k) (f (q + k)  f (q)) qh(k)eit
i 1
t (q) =z d3k 2(k) (f (q + k)  f (q)) qh(k)eit .
i 2

(35)

for the rst of these we have |i 1
grand in i 2

t (q)| < /2 by construction. for the second, the inte-
t (q) is dened on u2, which does not contain zero, so that  is dierentiable

13

on the domain of integration (i.e., u2) . one can then apply the method of stationary
phase to this integral, using the partial derivatives of ki, to show that i 2
t (q)  0 as
|t|   .
we have shown that it(q)  0 as |t|  , for every q. note that it(q) satises
the inequality |it(q)|  r d3k |f (q + k)  f (q)| |qh(k)|, and the latter is in l1(q).
the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem [23] may now be invoked to prove
that it  0 as |t|  , and this completes the proof. 2
z d3q d3kf (q + k)g(q)qh(k)eit

z d3q d3kf (q + k)g(q)qh(k)eit (36)

lemma 1 means that we have to show that the two integrals

and

have the same asymptotic limits, where ,  are dened in (30) and (27) respectively.
before proceeding with this, let us recall the form of taylors theorem for a smooth

function u, i.e.

u(q + k)  u(q)  iu(q)ki = r(q, k)
and
|k|  0 .

|r(q, k)|

|k|  0 as

(37)

thus, for a xed value of q and a given  > 0, there is a  > 0 such that if |k| < 
then |r(q, k)|/|k| <  . if the choice of k is restricted to the set {k : |k| < 1}, then
 t0 > 0 such that |t| > t0, we have |r(q, k/t)|/|k/t| <  and from this we are able
to conclude that |tr(q, k/t)| <  for all |t| > t0 .

we shall now prove our nal theorem.

theorem 2 let f, g, h, ,  be dened as in (27) and (30). if we dene it as

it =z d3q d3k f (q + k)g(q)qh(k)(eit  eit) ,

(38)

then it  0 as |t|  .
proof in the following discussions the value of the functions f, g, h in (34) are not
important and the only property that is required of them is that they are test functions.
for convenience, therefore, we shall write the integral as

it =z d3q d3k h(q, k)(eit  eit) .

with h(q, k) being a test function.

take a xed value of q and write

it(q) = z d3k h(q, k)eit(1  ei()t)

= z d(cid:18) k

t(cid:19) h(cid:18)q,

k

t(cid:19) ei(k/t)t(1  ei(k/t)t) .

(39)

(40)

as in lemma 1, we shall rst show that it(q) has a zero asymptotic limit.
in the
latter integral we have changed the variable from k to k/t so that now we are writing

14

(k/t) = eq+k/t  eq  (k/t) and (k/t) = eq+k/t  eq  (q  k)/(teq) . the latter
expression is in a form that will allow the use of taylors theorem.
let u1, u2 be the open cover of r3 given by u1 = {k : |k| < 1}, u2 = {k : |k| > 1
2},
and let 1, 2 be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to this cover. we write the
second integral in (40) as the sum of two integrals by incorporating this partition, i.e.

i 1

i 2

t (q) = z d(cid:18) k
t (q) = z d(cid:18) k
= z d(cid:18) k

t(cid:19) 1(k) h(cid:18)q,
t(cid:19) 2(k) h(cid:18)q,
t(cid:19) 2(k)h(cid:18)q,

k

k

t(cid:19) ei(k/t)t(1  ei(k/t)t)
t(cid:19) ei(k/t)t(1  ei(k/t)t)
t(cid:19) (ei(k/t)t  ei(k/t)t) ,

k

(41)

and we shall deal with i 1

t (q) rst.

due to the presence of 1, the integral i 1

t (q) is dened on {k : |k| < 1}. now given
 > 0,   > 0 such that if || <  then |1 ei| <  . from taylors theorem, (see (37)
and the paragraph following it) we can nd a t0 > 0 such that, for all |k| < 1, if |t| > t0
then |(cid:0)eq+k/t  eq  (k  q)/(teq)(cid:1) t| = |tr(q, k/t)| < , say. then if |t| > t0, we
have

(42)

t(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
t (q)| z d(cid:18) k
h(cid:18)q,
|i 1

k

t(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

 = z d3k|h(q, k)| ,

where the latter integral is well dened, is independent of t and has been obtained from
the previous one by changing the variables.

the next step is to show that the asymptotic limit of i 2

t (q) is zero. for this we
consider the last integral in (41) as the dierence of the two obvious integrals given by
their exponential terms, i.e.

i 2

1 (t, q) = z d(cid:18) k

t(cid:19) 2(k) h(cid:18)q,

k

t(cid:19) ei(k/t)t

= z d3k 2(kt) h(q, k) ei(k)t

i 2

2 (t, q) = z d(cid:18) k

t(cid:19) 2(k) h(cid:18)q,

k

t(cid:19) ei(k/t)t

= z d3k 2(kt) h(q, k) ei(k)t ,

(43)

with the nal forms of i 2

1 , i 2
we shall rst examine i 2

2 being obtained by the obvious change of variables.
1 and we begin by changing the variable for k again, this

time to k = k with |k| = 1 and   0, i.e. polar coordinates. we now have

i 2

1 (t, q) =z dk z 

0

2d 2(kt) h(q, kt) ei(k)t .

(44)

note that 2(kt) = 2(kt) and this will be zero for 0  t  1

2 . the exponent of

the integral in (44) is

(k) = eq+k  eq  

15

so that

1() def=




=

q  k + 
eq+k  1 .

(45)

as   0, 1() tends, uniformly in k, to (q  k/eq)  1, and since |q  k/eq| 
(|q|/eq) < 1, we have 1() = / is bounded, uniformly in k, strictly away from
0 in a neighbourhood of  = 0 . it is also easy to check that 1() is non-zero for any
nite value of  .
we now have

i 2

1 (t, q) = z dk z 
itz dk z

1()(cid:19) ei(k)t,

(46)

with the latter expression being obtained after integration by parts in , and noting
that the boundary terms vanish. this can then be written as the sum of two integrals

i 2
1 (t, q) =

   2h(q, k)
2(kt)(cid:19)  2h(q, k)

1() ! ei(k)t .

(47)

if v1(q, k) def= 2h(q, k)/1() then v1(q, k)/ is rapidly decreasing at in-
nity. the rst integral in (47) can now be disposed of since it is bounded by
and since this is well dened, vanishes as |t|   .
before dealing with the second integral in (47) it is worthwhile examining the prop-
erties of the derivatives of 2. we can write this function as 2(k) = (k, ), empha-
sising the fact that 2 is a function of two variables. now let us write

0 d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(1/|t|)r dk r 

v1(q, k)/(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(k) def=




2(k) = 2(k, )

(48)

since 2 is smooth and 2(k) = 1 for  > 1, the function (k) is a smooth function
which has the important property that it is zero for  > 1, i.e.,  has its support in
{ : 1/2    1}.

the second integral in (47), which we denote by j t

1 (q), is now

j t
1 (q) =

2d t (kt) v1(q, k) ei(k)t

(49)

2d (kt) v1(q, k) ei(k)t .

the last integral in (49) is now written in a form which is more convenient and which is
obtained by the following changes of variables. first replace k by k, and then replace

16

k by k/t . the form of j t

1 (q) then changes to

j t
1 (q) =

1

i z d(cid:18) k

t(cid:19) (k) v1(cid:18)q,

k

t(cid:19) ei( k

t )t

(50)

in order to deal with (50) we shall rst have to examine the second integral in (43).
applying the same methods to i 2
2 can also
be written as the sum of two integrals, as in (47), but with the exponent  replaced
with  and 1 replaced with 2, where

1 one can easily show that i 2

2 as we have to i 2

2() def=

(52)

c.f. (47). the function 2 has similar properties to 1 and the rst integral in (52)
vanishes asymptotically in a similar fashion to the corresponding integral in (47). this
leaves us with the latter integral in (52), which we shall write as j t
2 (q) . using the
same changes of variables, this can can be written as

1

j t
2 (q) =

i z d3 (cid:18) k
the nal objective is to show that j t
first dene j t

3 (q) as

this can be achieved in two steps.

j t
3 (q) =

2 (q) is replaced by v1. then it is straightforward to prove, along the

t(cid:19) (k) v1(cid:18)q,
2 (q)  j t
3 (q)  0 as |t|  . this is also straight-
t (q)  0 as |t|  
this proves that, for every q, it(q)  0 as |t|   (see(40)). the lebesgue
dominated convergence theorem now implies that it  0 as |t|  , as required. 2

i.e., the v2 in j t
lines of lemma 1, that, for all q, we have j t
1 (q)  j t
forward and can be fashioned along the lines of the proof that i 1
(see (41) and the paragraph that follows it.) we omit the details.

secondly, we must show that j t

3 (q)  0 as |t|  .
