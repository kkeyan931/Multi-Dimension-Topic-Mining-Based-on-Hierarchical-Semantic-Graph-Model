(2) thus a, longer gauge-dependent, becomes path-dependent. choose contour spacelike straight line z1 = 1 + (y )1, (0 1) parameter describing contour 1 arbitrary (xed) reference point. without loss generality, choose 1 = 0. path choice may made explicit splitting eq.(1) form short calculation yields a1(x) = a1(x) 1 a0(x) = a0(x) 0 1 z0 1 z0 dx1a1(x1), dx1a1(x1), a1(x0, x1) = 0, a0(x0, x1) = 1 z0 dx1e1(x1), 3 (3) (4) (5) (6) e1 one-dimensional electric eld. expressions coincide poincare gauge conditions . turn attention fermion eld. formalism charged matter eld together electromagnetic cloud (dressing) surrounds it, physical electron, given , (y) = exp iezcy dza(z)!

(7) (8) worthwhile remarking point breaking gauge invariance elds standard formalism transformed breaking translational invariance path-dependent formalism. way solving problem letting reference point 1 go innity. proceed further, wish show approach yields interesting results calculating gauge-invariant photon propagator. expression physical elds (1) shown gauge-invariant propagator given d(x, y) = d(x, y) + x z x dzd(z, y) + dwd(x, w)+ z dzz + xy z x dwd(z, w). (9) d(x, y) right-hand side (rhs) eq.(9) photon propagator taken arbitrary gauge. implementation poincare gauge amounts using contour z1 = 1 + (y )1 z1 = 1 + (x )1. choose, example, d(x, y) temporal gauge, is, d(x, y) = g1g1(x1 y1)(cid:18)1 2|x0 y0| + b(x0 y0) a(cid:19) , (10) where, well known, residual gauge invariance manifests presence constants b. peculiarity temporal gauge, x gauge uniquely. then, eq.(9), nd 4 d(x, y) = g0g0 1 2 (x0 y0)(cid:16)|x1 y1| |x1 1| |y1 1|(cid:17) . (11) thus one avoids unphysical features associated gauge-dependent formulation. nevertheless, expected, propagator breaks translational invari- ance. solution problem letting 1 go innity. however, intend address problems here. fuller account gauge invariant greens functions provided elsewhere . concludes brief introduction gauge invariant variables gauge conditions. iii. interaction energy qed2 already mentioned, immediate objective calculate interaction energy external probe sources schwinger model. this, exploit rich structure electromagnetic cloud dressing around static fermions. shall begin considering bosonized form schwinger model : 1 4 f 2 + 1 2 ()() l = j 0 external current, p = e refers vacuum. 2 e 2 f + +mx (cos (2 + ) 1) a0j 0, (12) exp(e) e euler-mascheroni constant, 3 2 a. massless case purpose compute interaction energy = 0 case. rst step direction carry integration (12). allows us write eective lagrangian l = 1 4 f 1 + e2 1 2! f a0j 0. (13) worthwhile sketching point canonical quantization theory hamiltonian analysis point view. canonical momenta = (cid:16)1 + e2 nonvanishing canonical poisson brackets 1 2(cid:17) f 0 5 {a(t, x), (t, y)} = (x y). since 0 vanishes usual primary constraint 0 = 0 , 1 = (cid:16)1 + e2 therefore canonical hamiltonian (14) 1 2(cid:17) f 10 . (15) hc = z dx 1 2 1 1 + e2 1 2!1 1 + 11a0 + a0j 0 . requiring primary constraint 0 = 0 preserved time yields following sec- ondary constraint 1(x) = 11 j 0. (16) straightforward check constraints theory constraints rst class. hamiltonian generates translations time given h = hc +z dx (c0(x)0(x) + c1(x)1(x)), (17) c0(x) c1(x) arbitrary functions. furthermore, since 0 = 0 always, a0 (x) =  = c0(x) , discard a0(x) 0(x) . therefore hamiltonian reduces h = z dx c(x) = c1(x) a0(x). 1 2 1 1 + e2 1 2!1 1 + c(x)(cid:16)11 j 0(cid:17) , (18) according usual procedure introduce supplementary condition vector potential full set constraints becomes second class, write 2(x) = z 1 0 dx1a1(x) = 0, (19) where, previous section, parameter describing spacelike straight line integration. immediately follows fundamental dirac brackets read na1(x), a1(y)o = 0 = n1(x), 1(x)o , na1(x), 1(y)o = (1)(x y) x 1 z 1 0 dx1(1)(x y). 6 (20) (21) important realize expression (8) represents charged particles together associated proper electric eld. see arises let | ei eigenvector electric eld operator e1(x), eigenvalue 1(x) : e1(x) | ei = 1(x) | ei. next consider state (y) | ei. means eq. (22) e1(x)(y) | ei = (y)e1(x) | ei +  | ei. hamiltonian analysis, eq. (23) may rewritten e1(x)(y) | ei = 1(x) + q 1 + e2 1 2 x!1 z 1 0 dy1(1)(y1 x1) (y) | ei. (22) (23) (24) hence see operator (y) dressing operator creation electron together associated proper electric eld. notice integral eq.(24) nonvanishing contour integration. result, static electric eld line. point mention consider modied form electromag- netic cloud poincare gauge eq.(8), equivalent coulomb gauge , is, (y) = exp(cid:18)iqz 0 dzkal k (z)(cid:19) (y), (25) al 1 refers longitudinal part a1, would obtain eld dresses charge electric eld : e1(x)(y) | ei = (cid:18)1(x) + e e q 2 |x1y1|(cid:19) (y) | ei. (26) order calculate energy external static charges, take fermion localized 1 antifermion y1, dressed according eq.(8), compute expectation value qed2 hamiltonian physical state | i, denote hhi. hamiltonian structure, 7 hhi = h|z dx1 1 2 1 1 + e2 1 2!1 1 |i . (27) mentioned before, fermions taken static, thus substitute 2 -2 1 eq.(27). case write hhi = h|z dx1 1 2 1 1 e2 1 2 1!1 1 |i . (28) established dirac , physical states |i correspond gauge invariant ones. way, state corresponding two opposite charges dierent points made gauge invariant including dressing eq.(8), keeps entire state gauge invariant. words, | | (y)(y)i = (y) exp iqz dz1a1(z)! (y) |0i , (29) |0i physical vacuum state. ready calculate hhi . using formalism, show e1(x) |i = (y)(y)e1(x) |0i + q 1 e2 1 2 1!1 z dz1(x1 z1) |i . (30) inserting eq. (28), energy presence static charges given hhi = hhi0 + q2 2 e (cid:16)1 e e |yy|(cid:17) , (31) hhio = h0| h |0i . since potential given term energy depends separation two fermions, expression (31) obtain v = q2 2 e (cid:16)1 e e |yy|(cid:17) . (32) thus demonstrated potential fermions directly obtained structure photonic clouds around static fermions known. case expression (32) expected screening contribution potential. physically means initial string broken charges screened. terms, result interaction massless fermions original coulomb potential ( proportional 8 distance ) screened. feature similar expected qcd strings adjoint representation. conclude subsection, important notice path choice stated eq.(25) (modied poincare gauge), previous canonical formalism, write scalar potential ao(t, x) = z 1 0 dx1el 1 (t, x) = z 1 0 dx1 1 e2 1 2 1!1 x x 1 (j 0(x)) 2 x , (33) superscript l refers longitudinal part j 0 external source. ac- cordingly, potential pair static pointlike opposite charges located , is, j 0(t, x) = q{(x y) (x y)}, given v = q (a0(y) a0(y)) = q2 2 |yy|(cid:17) . (34) e (cid:16)1 e e gratifying notice simplicity directness derivation, man- ifestly gauge-invariant. b. massive case proceed consider massive case. purpose carry integration (12). since expression non-polynomial , expand eective lagrangian terms f . thus follows l = 1 4 f 2 e2 4 f 1 2 + 4m f a0j 0, (35) taken = 0. look limit slowly varying elds, nd l = 1 4 f 1 + e2 42m! f a0j 0. (36) previous subsection, objective calculate potential energy theory. however, know, calculation facilitated using expression: a0(t, x) = z 1 0 dx1el 1 (t, x). 9 (37) thus obtain a0(t, x) = 1 + e2 42m!1 z 1 0 dx1 x 1 (j 0(x)) 2 x . (38) j 0(t, x) = q((x a)) expression (38) becomes a0(t, x) = q 2 1 + e2 42m!1 |x a|. (39) means expression (39) evaluate interaction energy pair static pointlike opposite charges y, v = q (a0(y) a0(y)) = q2 2 1 + e2 42m!1 |y y|. considering limit e, get v = q2 e2 22m|y y|. (40) (41) recognized standard result interaction potential , also connement contribution potential. derivation tells us one fact interpolate screening connement soon dynamical fermions nonvanishing mass. therefore interest reexamine transition limits. see arises formalism, start eq.(35). using fact elds taken static, means substituting 2 2 1 , get l = 1 4 f 2 + e2 4 f 1 2 1 4m f a0j 0. (42) thus, present approach, scalar potential (37) may written a0(t, x) = z 1 0 dx1x 1 j 0(x) 2 x 2! 4mz 1 0 dx1 x 1 (j 0(x)) (2 2)x2 x 2 e2 + 4m. j 0(t, x) = q((x a)) eq.(43) reduces 2 a. 2 (cid:19)(cid:16)1 ea(cid:17) + 2 1 2 (cid:18)1 + a0(t, x) = e2 q 4m q , (43) (44) expression (44) immediately shows potential two opposite charges located given 10 v = q2 2 (cid:18)1 + 4m 2 (cid:19)(cid:16)1 e|yy|(cid:17) + q2 2 1 e2 2 |y y|. straightforward check limit = 0, expression (45) reduces (34). (45) taken vacuum angle zero. want consider nonvanishing contribution potential would follow formalism. mind, start writing l = 1 4 f f e2 4 f 1 2 + 4m f + em 1 2 + 4m f a0j 0. (46) since dealing static fermions, substitute 2 2 write 1 . case l = 1 4 f 1 e2 1 1 4m! f em 2 1 2 1 4m a0j 0. (47) since rst term right-hand side (rhs) eq. (47) gave result potential given eq. (42), need consider second, dependent, term. using (37), may write expression scalar potential form 0(t, x) = z 1 0 dx12em(cid:16)2 1 2(cid:17)1 , (48) 2 e2 + 4m. look limit slowly varying elds, nd 0(t, x) = z 1 0 2em 2 x1 = e 2 1 e2 2 x1. (49) hence see potential two opposite charges ( q = e ) given v = e2 2 1 e2 2 |y y|. (50) also, limit slowly varying elds, inclusion term would reduce potential factor, coulomb potential. expression see that, v = 1 ! |y y|.
