abstract

we construct dual lagrangians for g/h models in two space-time dimensions for arbitrary
lie groups g and h  g. our approach does not require choosing coordinates on g/h, and
allows for a natural generalization to lie-poisson duality. for the case where the target metric
on g/h is induced from the invariant metric on g, the dual system is a gauged higgs model,
with a nonconstant metric and a coupling to an antisymmetric tensor. the dynamics for the
gauge connection is governed by a bf -term. lie-poisson duality is relevant once we allow for
a more general class of target metrics, as well as for couplings to an antisymmetric tensor, in
the primary theory. then the dual theory is written on a group g dual to g, and the gauge
group h (which, in general, is not a subgroup of g) acts nonlinearly on g. the dual system
therefore gives a nonlinear realization of a gauge theory. all dual descriptions are shown to be
canonically equivalent to the corresponding primary descriptions, at least at the level of the
current algebra.

introduction

cosets models have been around for a long time. there are many well known examples,
including the o(3) nonlinear -model, the su (n )  su (n ) chiral model and cp n1 model.
the standard lagrangian l for a g/h model contains terms quadratic in velocities, and can
be written on the tangent manifold t g of g.
it is invariant under local transformations
by h  g, and also possibly global transformations by g. our interest here concerns the
question of possible dual lagrangians. motivated by developments in string theory, techniques
have been devised for nding dual lagrangian descriptions of eld theories in two space-time
dimensions. here we refer more specically to the techniques of nonabelian t-duality, as they
can be applied to g/h models.[1] in the original approach, one makes a choice of coordinates
on the manifold, whereby isometry directions are distinguished from non-isometry directions,
and then introduces a gauge connection for every isometry. this then means that various
coset manifolds must be analyzed separately, and more often than not, the analysis may be
quite formidable. it therefore seems safe to say that following such an approach, the general
structure of the dual theory for g/h models is not very transparent.

in this article, we instead write down a dual lagrangian l for g/h models without relying
on coordinate charts on g/h, and we check that it leads to the same dynamics as the standard
lagrangian. the result applies for arbitrary lie groups g and h, and furthermore, we are
able to do this for a variety of target space metrics. we show that at the level of currents, the
dual descriptions are canonically equivalent to the standard ones. our approach diers from
previous ones[2] which realize coset models as gauged wess-zumino-witten models[3]. it is
more closely related to the treatments in refs. [4], [5] and [6], which are based on lie-poisson
t-duality.[7]

we now summarize some of the features of the dual lagrangian l. while the standard
lagrangian l, which we also refer to as the primary lagrangian, can be written without
the use of gauge connections or topological terms, connections, as well as topological terms,
enter in the dual description. in l the dynamics of gauge elds is governed by a bf term. to
illustrate some of the structures of the dual theory, we rst consider the example of g = su (2)
and h = u (1), where one recovers the familiar dynamics of the o(3) nonlinear -model. its
dual theory can be written in terms of a scalar doublet coupled to a u (1) gauge eld, whose
eld strength is proportional to the instanton number. the scalars elds are also coupled
to a nonconstant metric and an antisymmetric tensor. it is convenient to also introduce an
auxiliary scalar eld in the dual description, which then allows for a local expression for the
metric. the auxiliary eld couples to the u (1) connection, as well. by choosing a gauge and
eliminating the auxiliary variables it should be possible to recover all previous expressions for
the dual lagrangian. if in l one introduces the a kinetic energy term for the gauge eld, this
corresponds to adding a higher order term in the primary lagrangian l. there is some recent
interest in such theories in connection with knot solitons.[8]

2

for the case of arbitrary g and h, with the constant group metric appearing in the primary
lagrangian l, the dual system is a gauged higgs theory with a nonconstant metric and coupling
to an antisymmetric tensor. now there are dim[g/h] scalar elds, as well as dim[h] auxiliary
elds, coupled to dim[h] gauge connections. once we drop the restriction of constant target
metrics in the primary theory, as well as allow for a coupling an antisymmetric tensor, a
more interesting structure emerges in the dual theory. the latter is now written on a group
g dual to g (in the lie-poisson sense), and the gauge group h (which, in general, is not a
subgroup of g) has a nonlinear action on g. as a result, one ends up expressing the dual
lagrangian l in terms of nonlinear covariant derivatives on g, and the gauge symmetry is not
immediately obvious. but our construction of l, starting from the hamiltonian formalism,
ensures gauge invariance, and thus provides a technique for constructing nonlinear realizations
of gauge theories.

in section 2, we review the standard lagrangian description of g/h models, and then
specialize to the o(3) nonlinear -model in section 3. there, we construct the dual theory,
and demonstrate that the role of identities and equations of motion are interchanged in the
two formulations. the analysis is generalized to the case of arbitrary g and h in section 4.
in section 5, we construct the corresponding hamiltonian descriptions of the two theories and
demonstrate that, at least locally, the two theories are canonically equivalent. we also show
that these theories are canonically equivalent to an equivalence class of kac-moody algebras
associated with the cotangent bundle group t g. in section 6, following [6],[9], we generalize
to kac-moody algebras associated with the drinfeld double group [10]. this leads to lie-
poisson t-duality, [7] and allows for nonconstant metrics and antisymmetric tensors in both
the primary and dual descriptions.

2 standard lagrangian description

we now introduce our notation, and review the standard lagrangian description of g/h
models.

say g and h  g are n and n  m dimensional groups, respectively, with the former

generated by ei, i = 1, 2, ..n , and having commutation relations:

[ei, ej] = ck

ijek .

(2.1)

we can split the generators into ea, a = 1, 2, ...m and e = em +,  = 1, 2, ...n  m , the
latter generating h,

[e, e] = c

 e ,

 = cm +
c

m + m + .

we will assume that the metric gij on g is nondegenerate and block diagonal, i.e.

ga m + = 0 .

3

(2.2)

(2.3)

the structure constants satisfy

cc
m + m + = 0 ,

cm +
m + b = 0 .

(2.4)

the second relation in (2.4) follows from the rst, using (2.3) and the invariance property
ci
jkgi = gjici

k.

we can now give the expression for the primary lagrangian density l. we take the fun-
damental elds g(x) to have values in g. l is a quadratic function of the velocity components
(g1g)a, where  = 0, 1 is the space time index and g1g = (g1g)iei. utilizing the
group metric gij projected onto g/h, and following[11],[12], we write

l = 


2

gab(g1g)a(g1g)b ,

where a, b = 1, 2, ...m and  is an arbitrary constant. l is gauge invariant under

g(x)  g(x)h(x) ,

h(x)  h ,

(2.5)

(2.6)

and consequently denes a theory on g/h. l is also invariant under global transformations

g  g0g ,

g0  g .

(2.7)

for the case g = su (2) and h = u (1) we obtain the dynamics of the o(3) nonlinear -model.
g = su (n)  su (n) and h = su (n)diagonal yields the g = su (n)  su (n) chiral model,
while g = u (n) and h = u (n  1)  u (1) corresponds to the cp n1 model. in sections 3-5,
we shall discuss the dual description of all such models in two space-time dimensions.

in section 6, we obtain the dual for the more general system obtained by replacing gab
in (2.5) by a nonconstant metric (g)ab. we further consider the addition of a term with a
coupling to an antisymmetric tensor (g)ab. the primary lagrangian then has the form

l = 


2

(g)ab(g1g)a(g1g)b 


2

 (g)ab(g1g)a(g1 g)b .

(2.8)

now gauge invariance under (2.6) follows only for certain metrics (g)ab and antisymmetric
tensors (g)ab, i.e. those which gauge transform under the adjoint action of h,

(gh)ab = a(h) c

a a(h) d

b (g)cd ,

(2.9)

where heah1 = a(g) b
a eb , and we have the same transformation property for (g). thus the
target space is again g/h. on the other hand, the global symmetry (2.7) is broken. starting
with the hamiltonian formalism, we shall obtain a class of metrics and antisymmetric tensors
consistent with the gauge symmetry, and for every such metric and antisymmetric tensor there
is a corresponding dual lagrangian description.

o(3) nonlinear -model

3.1 primary formulation

the simplest nontrivial example of the above system is the o(3) nonlinear -model. the
target space in this case is s2. thus we can introduce the elds i(x), i = 1, 2, 3, satisfying the
constraint i(x)i(x) = 1. the standard lagrangian density for the o(3) nonlinear -model
is


2

l = 

ii .

(3.1)

alternatively, we can rewrite the lagrangian according to (2.5), with g = su (2) and h =
u (1). for this we rst realize the constraint by writing

i(x)ei = g(x)e3g(x)1 ,

(3.2)

g(x) being su (2)-valued elds and ei being su (2) generators. since i are invariant under

g(x)  g(x)e(x)e3 ,

(3.3)

we have thus introduced a u (1) gauge symmetry, the generator being e1 = e3. the structure
constants and invariant metric for su (2)) are ck
it is not hard to
show[11],[12] that the lagrangian density (3.1) may be reexpressed according to

ij = ijk and gij = ij.

l = 


2

(g1g)a(g1g)a ,

(3.4)

where a = 1, 2. the lagrangian, like i, is invariant under (3.3), and the physical degrees of
freedom therefore span su (2)/u (1)  s2.

the equations of motion resulting from variations of g imply the existence of conserved

currents j i = 0, where

j i = [a(g) i

a (g1g)a] ,

(3.5)

where a(g) denotes the adjoint matrix representation of g, geig1 = a(g) j
i ej . due to the
gauge symmetry there are only two equations in (3.5). to see this, let us rewrite the equations
in terms of a new set of variables a

 and a:

 = (g1g)a ,
a
a = (g1g)3 .

(3.6)

(3.7)

a transforms as a u (1) connection under (3.3), while a
space. we can dene the covariant derivative for the latter variables according to

 undergo a rotation in the internal

(d)a = a

  abab
 ,

(3.8)

where ab = ab3 . now by using a(g) j
motion state that the covariant curl of a is zero:

i = ik a(g) j

k (g1g) , we see that the equations of

(d)a = 0 .

(3.9)

5

in addition to the equations of motion (3.9), we have a set of three maurer-cartan equations.
in terms of a and a

, these three identities can be expressed as

(d)a = 0 ,
1
2

f =

aba

b

 ,

(3.10)

(3.11)

f being the u (1) curvature, f =  a . when expressed in terms of the elds on s2, it is
given by

f = 4 (cid:18)

1
8

ijk ij k(cid:19) ,

(3.12)

the quantity in parenthesis being the instanton number density.

in summary, the dynamical system is determined by the equations of motion (3.9), as well
as identities (3.10) and (3.11). we note that there are not an equal number of equations of
motion and identities. we next present a dual formulation of the above system, where eqs.
(3.10) and (3.11) are equations of motion and eq. (3.9) follows from an identity (evaluated
on-shell).

3.2 dual formulation

the dual lagrangian l will be expressed in terms of three unconstrained scalar elds  and
a, a = 1, 2, and a u (1) connection a.  ends up playing the role of an auxiliary variable.
before considering the full system, we rst examine a lagrangian l0 depending only on a
and a:

l0 = 


2

(d)a(d)a 


2

ab(d)a(d )b ,

(3.13)

where the covariant derivative (d)a is dened by (d)a = a  abba . l0 is gauge
invariant under the following innitesimal variations:

a = abb
a =  ,

(3.14)

where here we take  to be innitesimal. ab and ab represent the dual metric and antisym-
metric tensor, respectively. upon assuming for the moment that  and  are constants, we
get (3.10) as the equations of motion associated with variations of a, provided we now dene
a
 (up to an overall constant) by

a
 = (d)a   ab(d)b .

this denition leads to the identity

ab(d)ab

 = 0 .

(3.15)

(3.16)

using the equations of motion (3.10), this can be rewritten as ab(ab
solved by writing

) = 0, which is locally

  = abab

 .

(3.17)

6

we use this equation to dene the scalar eld , which we now promote to a degree of freedom
to be varied in the action. (more precisely, as stated earlier, it will play the role of an auxiliary
variable.) this will allow us to recover eq. (3.17), as well as (3.11) from an action principle,
through variations of a and , respectively. the lagrangian l0 is, however, insucient for
this purpose, as we shall need to add a bf or instanton term. furthermore,  and  now need
to be functions of . [this wont spoil the result of (3.10) for the equations of motion.] the
total lagrangian is then

l = l0 + a .

(3.18)
 is assumed to be gauge invariant. then, although l is then no longer gauge invariant under
(3.14), the corresponding action integral is. now it easily follows that variations with respect
to a lead to (3.17). since the latter is associated with an identity, there are no true dynamical
degrees of freedom in a. variations with respect to  lead to

f = 


2

(d)a(d)a 


2

ab(d)a(d )b ,

(3.19)

the prime indicating a derivative with respect to . using (3.15), this agrees with (3.11)
provided that

these equations are solved by

 = 2 ,

 = 2  2 .

 =



2 + 2 ,

 = 



2 + 2 ,

(3.20)

(3.21)

 again denoting an arbitrary constant. from the hamiltonian analysis (see section 5), we nd
that this constant can be identied with the constant  appearing in the primary lagrangian.
it remains to obtain (3.9). it follows from another useful identity. for this let us invert (3.15),
using (3.21), to solve for (d)a:

now take the covariant curl to get

(d)a = a

  abb .

 (d)a = ab(cid:18)f b  b

  (d)b(cid:19) .

(3.22)

(3.23)

the right hand side is seen to vanish upon imposing the equations of motion (3.10), (3.11) and
(3.17), and hence we recover the equation of motion of the primary formulation (3.9).

we thus have obtained all the dynamical equations of the primary formulation. we note
that while the coecient  of the kinetic energy term in the standard description is a constant,
the analogue in the dual description goes like ( + 2/)1. (a nonlocal expression for the
latter results if we use (3.17) to eliminate .) this relation between coecients resembles
the r  1
r correspondence in abelian t-duality.[13] concerning symmetries, while the u (1)
gauge symmetry is obvious in the dual description, the global su (2) symmetry (2.7) is not.
in the dual theory, the latter can only be dened nonlocally.
it should now be possible to
recover all previous expressions for the dual lagrangian by choosing the appropriate gauge
and eliminating the auxiliary variable .

7

3.3 higher order terms

it is easy to consider the possibility of adding higher order terms to the primary lagrangian
(2.5) or (3.1). for example, we can add the quartic term

lquar =

f 2 ,


2

(3.24)

where  is a constant and f is dened in terms of su (2) group elements g through (3.2) and
(3.12). then the equation of motion (3.9) is replaced by

 (d)a = abf b

 .

(3.25)

the identities (3.10) and (3.11) are, of course, unchanged. one adds precisely the same term
(3.24) to the dual lagrangian (3.18), only there a is treated as an independent degree of
freedom. thus a kinetic energy is now associated with a. its variations leads to

 ( + f ) = abab

 ,

(3.26)

replacing (3.17). none of the other equations of motion for the dual system are aected. upon
substituting (3.26), as well as (3.10) and (3.11), into the identity (3.23), we once again get
(3.25).

4 general coset models

here we nd the dual lagrangian description associated with the primary lagrangian (2.5),
for the case of arbitrary lie groups g and h  g .

4.1 primary formulation

we begin with the primary lagrangian (2.5). there are now m equations of motion resulting
from variations of g, and they once again can be written as (3.9). for this, a
 is again dened
as in (3.6), while

a

 = (g1g)m + .

(4.1)

a

 transforms as an h connection under (2.6). the covariant derivative is now dened by

(d)a = a

 + ca

m + ca

c
 .

(4.2)

in addition to the equations of motion (3.9), we have the generalization of the identities (3.10)
and (3.11) corresponding to n maurer-cartan equations:

1
2
1

 need not vanish. f  is the h curvature,
now, in general, the covariant divergence of a

f  = (a

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

4.2 dual formulation

for the dual theory, we introduce n scalar elds, a and , along with the yang-mills con-
nection one form a, which undergo gauge transformations

a = cb
m + ab
 = c

a = d + c

a ,

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

 = e being an innitesimal element of the lie algebra h of h. upon dening the
covariant derivative of a according to (d)a = da + cb
a m +ab , we can construct the
following lagrangian density:

l = 

1
2

ab(d)a(d)b 

1
2

 ab(d)a(d )b  f  ,

(4.9)

generalizing (3.18). now the dual metric ab and the antisymmetric tensor ab are functions
of a and . neither ab nor ab are gauge invariant. gauge invariance demands that ab
and ab transform, respectively, as symmetric and antisymmetric second rank tensors. the
form for l, including the bf -term, is similar to previous expressions in the literature.[1] here
we are able to write down ab and ab without having to specify coordinates on the original
target manifold g/h.

to determine the coecients ab and ab we demand that the equations of motion resulting
from variations in the scalar elds are (4.3) and (4.4). variations of f give the former equation
provided that

ab
f
ab
f

= cf

dc(dacb  dacb)

(4.14)

which generalizes the solution (3.21) found for the coecients of the dual nonlinear -model.
the underline indicates the submatrix obtained by projecting onto g/h. thus the matrix
g consists only of matrix elements g
= gab, a, b = 1, 2, ...m . as before,  is an arbitrary
constant, which we shall identify with the coecient  appearing in the primary lagrangian.
the matrix  in (4.14) is symmetric by inspection, while antisymmetry for  follows after
using the identity

ab

f g = g f .

(4.15)

the solution (4.14) easily reduces to (3.21) when g = su (2) and h = u (1), and we thus
recover the dual formulation of the nonlinear -model.

as in the dual formulation of the nonlinear -model, the connections are nondynamical
 in (4.9)

degree of freedoms and their variations do not lead additional conditions. varying a
gives

(d ) = cc

(4.16)

generalizing (3.17). here (d) =  + c

(4.17)

(4.18)

eq. (4.18) generalizes (3.16), the latter being an identity for the dual o(3) nonlinear -model.
it is not too hard to show that eq.
(4.18) is also an identity. the procedure is the same
as before. one inverts (4.12), solving for (d)a using the solutions (4.14) found for the
coecients:

(d)a = gabb

   fabb ,

(4.19)

and then substitutes into the right hand side of (4.18).

finally, if we take the covariant curl of (4.19) we get another identity

gab(d)b = cb

m + af b  fab(d)b  (cid:18)cc

ab(d)c + cm +

ab

(d)(cid:19)b ,

(4.20)

which generalizes (3.23). the right hand side of this equation vanishes upon applying (4.16),
(4.3) and (4.4) and hence we recover the equations of motion (3.9) of the standard formalism.
we thereby recover all the dynamical equations of the standard formalism.

5 hamiltonian descriptions

in this section, we note that the hamiltonian descriptions for the primary formulation and
dual formulation of g/h models are, at least locally, canonically equivalent.

5.1 primary formulation

the hamiltonian description corresponding to the primary lagrangian is written on an equiv-
alence class of the loop group lt g of the cotangent bundle t g. to describe it we can
introduce a 2n dimensional phase space, spanned by the elds g(x) and ki(x), the latter
generating, for example, right translations on g, i.e.

{ki(x), g(y)} = g(x)ei(x  y)

{ki(x), kj (y)} = ck

ijkk(x)(x  y) .

(5.1)

as usual, we assume the poisson brackets between two group elements vanishes. the phys-
ical subspace is 2m dimensional, and it is obtained after moding out gauge transformations
generated by the n  m rst class constraints

km +  0 .

(5.2)

up to lagrange multiplier terms involving the constraints (5.2), the canonical hamiltonian
can be written

h(g, k i) =

1

2 z dx(cid:18)gab(g11g)a(g11g)b +

gabkakb(cid:19) ,

(5.3)

where gabgbc = a
description.

c . the hamiltonian (5.3) and constraints (5.2) dene the primary hamiltonian

5.2 dual formulation

in the dual description, we start with a 6n  4m dimensional phase space spanned by a,
 and their corresponding conjugate momenta. a = 0a, as dened in (4.12), are the
, a
momenta conjugate to a. if we integrate by parts the topological term in (4.9), we get that
the momenta m + conjugate to  are constrained by

m +  a

1  0 ,

(5.4)

and there are 2(n m ) additional primary constraints stating that the momenta 
to a

 vanish,

 conjugate

in addition, there are n  m secondary constraints of the form



  0 .

(d1) + cc

m + bbc  0 .

given by

to write the second line, we used the identity

g + f  f = 2gg ,

which follows from (4.14).

(5.7)

(5.8)

to summarize, we get 6n  4m phase space variables subject to 4(n  m ) constraints.
the constraints can be evenly divided into a rst class and second class set. for the latter, we
take (5.4) and 1
  0. to implement the second class constraints we can go to a 4n  2m
dimensional reduced phase space spanned by dirac variables. a choice for dirac variables is:
a

, i and i, i = 1, 2, ..., n , where we dene

0 , 0

m + =   1

 .

(5.9)

the variables a

is expressed by

 are nondynamical and can be eliminated. this is because 0

the remaining 2n variables i and i are canonically conjugate, their equal time poisson
brackets being

thus as in the primary hamiltonian description, the resulting physical subspace is 2m dimen-
sional. it is obtained after moding out gauge transformations, now generated by (5.12), from
the space spanned by i and i.

it is now evident that the two dual hamiltonian descriptions for coset models are canonically
equivalent, at least locally. the hamiltonian (5.10) and constraints (5.12) are obtained from
(5.3) and (5.2) using the canonical transformation[6] :

ki  1i + ck

ijjk

(g11g)i  i .

12

(5.14)

(5.15)

this is the same canonical transformation that has been used to relate the standard description
of the su (2) principal chiral model with its dual description,[14] and it is a special case of
the canonical transformation linking theories which are lie-poisson dual.[9],[6] we consider the
more general class of canonical transformations in the next section. concerning (5.14), using
the canonical poisson brackets (5.11), we can easily show that the right hand side generates
the group g. concerning (5.15), we get that the canonical momenta a in the dual theory are
identied with 0a dened by (3.6) in the primary formulation. similarly, from (5.4) m +
gets identied with a

1 as dened by (4.1) in the primary formulation.

5.3 current algebra

the poisson algebra of currents for the two theories can be reexpressed in terms of an equiva-
lence class of kac-moody algebras associated with the cotangent bundle group t g. the latter
is generated by ei, along with another n generators ei , which have commutation relations

[ei, ej] = ci
[ei, ej] = 0 .

jkek

(5.16)

we can introduce a nondegenerate invariant scalar product on the lie algebra spanned ei and
ei:

< ei|ej >= i

j ,

< ei|ej >=< ei|ej >= 0 .

in terms of the phase space variables ki and g of the primary hamiltonian description, we
now dene the current

v = kiei + g11g .

(5.17)

its resulting poisson algebra is the central extension of the loop group of t g:

{ v(x)

, v(y)

} = [c, v(x)

](x  y) + cx(x  y) ,

(5.18)

1

2

1

where we use tensor product notation, the 1 and 2 labels referring to two separate vector

spaces, with v(x)

= v(x)  1l, v(y)

= 1l  v(y), and 1l being the unit operator. c in (5.18) is a

1

2

constant adjoint invariant tensor dened by c = ei  ei + ei  ei . of course, the same algebra
results if we express v in terms of the dual phase space variables i and i according to

v = (1i + ck

ijjk)ei + iei .

(5.19)

the equivalence class results after moding out the h gauge transformations generated by (5.2),
i.e.

< e|v(x) > 0 .

(5.20)

13

in terms of the currents, the hamiltonian is

h(v) =

1

2 z dx < gabea  eb +

1


gabea  eb | v(x)  v(x) > ,

(5.21)

and it is preserved under such transformations.

6 lie-poisson generalizations

the kind of duality we have been studying so far can be regarded as traditional nonabelian
t-duality. it has also been referred to as semiabelian duality. this is because while the elds
of the primary theory take values in a nonabelian group, the elds in the dual theory are
associated with an n dimensional abelian group, which we shall denote by g. it is the group
generated by ei, i = 1, 2, ...n . one may then ask whether or not it is possible to generalize our
formalism to the case of nonabelian g. the answer is yes, and we claim that there is a natural
generalization of the lagrangian (4.9) to one written on t g, where the function f appearing
in the dual metric and antisymmetric tensor becomes a nonlinear function of the elds. 

6.1 generalizing the current algebra

the natural choice for g is that it be dual of g in the lie-poisson sense. this means that,
g and g are maximally isotropic subgroups of a group gd known as the drinfeld double.[10]
then dim[g] = dim[ g] = 1
2 dim[gd]. gd is generated by all of ei and ei. in the case where ei
and ei satisfy commutation relations (2.1) and (5.16), gd is t g. more generally, if we denote
by cij

k the structure constants of g, we can have

[ei, ej] = ci
[ei, ej] = cij

jkek  cik
k ek ,

j ek

(6.1)

along with (2.1). now in addition to the usual jacobi identities for the lie algebras associated
with g and g, we have

ck
ijcm

k = c

kicmk

j  cm

kick

j  c

kjcmk

i + cm

kjck
i

.

(6.2)

we next ask, given the above generalization of the lie algebra gd spanned by ei and
ei, whether or not the hamiltonian dynamics of the previous section can still be utilized to
describe g/h coset models. more specically, using the current algebra (5.18), which now is
the kac-moody algebra associated with gd, is the hamiltonian (5.21) still (at least, weakly)
invariant under gauge transformations generated by (5.20)? it is easy to check that this is
indeed the case provided that we have the following restriction on the structure constants of
g:

cbc
m + = 0 ,
for another approach to this subject see refs. [4] and [5].

(6.3)

14

along with the conditions (2.4) and (2.3). this then means that, in addition to g having an
n  m dimensional subgroup h, g must have an m dimensional subgroup, which we denote
by h. the latter is generated by ea, a = 1, 2, ...m .

an example of a drinfeld group gd with this kind of structure for the maximally isotropic
subgroups is the lorentz group or sl(2, c). there we can take g = su (2) and g = sb(2, c),
the borel group. the structure constants for the former are ck
ij = ijk, and for the latter are
cij
k = ijk3. e3 generates a h = u (1) subgroup of su (2), while e1 and e2 generate a two
dimensional abelian subgroup h of sb(2, c). since su (2)/u (1) is the target space for the
o(3) nonlinear -model, we can thus expect to nd another dual description of this model,
this time in terms of elds spanning sb(2, c). as we shall see below, the primary lagrangian
then corresponds to (2.8).

more generally, instead of restricting to the dynamics resulting from the hamiltonian (5.21),

we could consider an arbitrary quadratic hamiltonian as is done in [6], i.e.

h(v) =

1

2 z dx < ijei  ej + ijei  ej + 2 j

i ei  ej| v(x)  v(x) > ,

(6.4)

where ij, ij and  j
i are constant matrices (the rst two being symmetric). we must impose
a number of conditions on the constant matrices in order to have a local h invariance. they
are:

m + i =  b

m + = bjcb

k m + + bkcb

j m + = 0

cjcbc

m +   b

c cc

j m + +  c

j cb

c m + = 0

(6.5)

ibcc

i m + +  b

a cca

m + + iccb

i m + +  c

a cba

m + = 0 .

we will not examine this more general possibility below, but rather restrict to hamiltonian
dynamics given by (5.21).

6.2 primary formulation

even though gd is no longer restricted to being t g, the current algebra (5.18) can still be
realized in terms of elds valued in t g, i.e. g(x) and ki(x), satisfying (5.1).[6], [9] now,
however, for nonzero cij
k the expression (5.17) for the currents v in terms of g(x) and ki(x)
must be modied:

where the matrix valued function f (g) is dened by

v = kiei + f (g)ijkjei + g11g ,

alternatively, we can write v(x) in terms of left generators on g, as is done in [6].

f (g)ij =< geig1  gejg1|ek  ek > .

(6.6)

(6.7)

15

f (g) is antisymmetric. this follows from

f (g)ij + f (g)ji =< geig1  gejg1|c > = < ei  ej| g
1

1 g
2

1c g
1

g
2

>

= < ei  ej|c >= 0 .

(6.8)

the semiabelian case discussed in the previous section corresponds to setting f = 0. to verify
that the poisson algebra (5.18) applies even when f 6= 0, we can rst compute the poisson
bracket of ki with f (g)jk:

{ki(x), f (g)jk(y)} = (cid:18)cjk

if (g)j(y)(cid:19)(x  y) .

i + cj

if (g)k(y)  ck

eq. (5.18) then follows after using the identity

c[ij
 f k] = f [icj

mf k]m ,

(6.9)

(6.10)

the brackets indicating antisymmetrized indices. this identity can be proved from the re-
sult that the scalar product of the commutator of two g generators, which can be expressed
according to

ei = f (g)ijej+ < geig1|ej > g1ejg ,

with a third g generator is zero.

writing the hamiltonian (5.21) in terms of g and ki, we now get

h(g, k i) =

1

2 z dx(cid:18)gab [(g11g)a+f (g)ackc] [(g11g)b+f (g)bdkd] +

1


gabkakb(cid:19) , (6.11)

generalizing (5.3). the constraints are still given by (5.2). the corresponding lagrangian is
(2.8), where the metric  and antisymmetric tensor  are

 = (cid:18) 1



g1  f gf(cid:19)1

,

 = gf  .

(6.12)

as before the underline indicates that we are restricting to the submatrix with elements in
g/h. since, provided (6.3) holds, the hamiltonian dynamics is invariant under h gauge
transformations, so is the lagrangian dynamics. it can be checked that the solution (6.12)
for the metric  and the antisymmetric tensor  is consistent with the gauge transformation
property (2.9). thus, by construction, (2.8) is invariant under (2.6). on the other hand, it is
no longer invariant under global g transformations (2.7) (except, of course, when f = 0). in
the semiabelian case, i.e. f = 0, we easily recover the lagrangian (2.5) from (2.8), since when
f is zero, so is , while  reduces to the constant metric g.

6.3 dual formulation

concerning the dual hamiltonian formulation, we introduce phase space variables g(x)  g
and k i(x) with values in t  g. the nonzero poisson brackets are

{ k i(x), g(y)} = g(x)ei(x  y)

16

{ k i(x), k j(y)} = cij
k

k k(x)(x  y) .

(6.13)

just as the current algebra (5.18) can be realized in terms of elds valued in t g, so can it be
realized in terms of elds valued in t  g. in analogy to (6.6), we have

v = k iei + f (g)ij k jei + g11g ,

where we replace the previous denition of f given in (4.13) by

f (g)ij =< geig1  gej g1|ek  ek > .

(6.14)

(6.15)

k = 0. then f (g)ij =
to recover the previous denition, we can write g = exp(iei) and set cij
ck
ijk . returning to the general case, upon comparing with (6.6), we see that the duality
transformation is now given by

ki  (g11g)i + f (g)ij k j

(g11g)i + f ij(g)kj  ki ,

(6.16)

(6.17)

generalizing the canonical transformations (5.14) and (5.15) of the semiabelian case. as is also
true in the semiabelian case, the canonical transformation between phase space coordinates,
here (g, ki) and (g, k i), can only be dened locally.

writing the hamiltonian (5.21) in terms of the t  g variables, we now get

h(g, ki) =

1

2 z dx(cid:18)gab k a k b +

1


gab [(g11g)a+ f (g)ai k i] [(g11g)b+ f (g)bj k j](cid:19) , (6.18)

while the constraints are

 = (g11g)m + + f (g)m + i k i  0 .

(6.19)

from (6.18) and (6.19) we easily recover the hamiltonian (5.10) and constraints (5.12) for the
dual system in the semiabelian case.

as gauge transformations are generated by the constraints (6.19), we can now see how the
gauge group h acts on the dual group g, and its corresponding lie algebra g. (note that,
in general, h is not a subgroup of g.) these transformations are nonlinear. innitesimal
variations g of g  g are of the form:

g =  f (g)m + i gei = g  < |g1eig > eig ,

(6.20)

where  = e are innitesimal elements of the lie algebra h of h. (6.20) gives the lie-
poisson generalization of (4.6) and (4.7). for the purpose of writing down the corresponding
dual lagrangian, we introduce the covariant derivative d on g. for this we rst note that
as a result of (6.20), left invariant one forms on g undergo the following gauge variations:

(g1dg)i = d f (g)m + i + (cid:18)cj

m + i  cjk

m +

f (g)ki(cid:19)(g1dg)j .

(6.21)

17

let us now dene the covariant derivative for left invariant one forms according to:

(g1dg)i = (g1dg)i + f (g)i m +a ,

(6.22)

a being an h connection one form. then using (4.8), (6.20) and (6.21), it undergoes the
gauge variations

(g1dg)i = (cid:18)cj

m + i  cjk

m +

f (g)ki(cid:19)(g1dg)j .

for this we also needed the dual of the identity (6.10), i.e.

c
[ij

fk] = f[icm

j

fk]m .

(6.23)

(6.24)

we can use (6.23) to dene covariant vectors on g.
w = wiei having values in the lie algebra of g undergoes h variations of the form

in other words, a covariant vector

w = [w, ]  < [w, ]|g1eig > g1eig .

(6.25)

the second term introduces a nonlinear contribution to the transformation. it vanishes in the
semiabelian case, and there we recover the usual adjoint action. (6.25) agrees with (6.23) for
w = g1dg. moreover, if x = xe  h gauge transforms under the adjoint action of h, i.e.
x = [x, ], then w = f (g)i m +xei is a covariant vector in g.

we now claim that the dual lagrangian is

l = 

ab(g) (g1dg)a(g1dg)b 

1
2
+  (g1g)m +a

1
2

1
2

ab(g)(g1dg)a(g1d g)b

 

 f (g)m + m +a

a
 .

(6.26)

this is a straightforward generalization of (4.9). the rst line gives the coupling to the target
metric and antisymmetric tensor, while the second line generalizes of the topological term
f  appearing in (4.9). now, in general, the latter is not separately gauge invariant (not
even up to a total divergence). rather, the gauge symmetry is hidden, and follows only after
considering all terms in the action.

to check that the expression (6.26) is correct, and also to determine the functional form
for the dual metric ab(g) and antisymmetric tensor ab(g), we apply the dirac procedure
to recover the above hamiltonian description. the analysis is essentially the same as in the
semiabelian case. following [12], let us parametrize the g group elements by n variables,
which we denote by i; g = g(i). the momenta i conjugate to these variables are then

i = (g1 g
i

)j (cid:18)j

a ab(g)(g1d0g)b  j

a ab(g)(g1d1g)b + j

m +a

1(cid:19) .

right generators k i are obtained after introducing matrices n i

j(g), dened by

ei = n i

j(g) g1 g
j

,

18

(6.27)

(6.28)

and writing

k i = n i

j(g)j .

as a result, we get that g and k i satisfy poisson brackets (6.13). from (6.27),

k a = ab(g)(g1d0g)b  ab(g)(g1d1g)b ,

and in analogy to (5.4), we get the primary constraints

k m +  a

1  0 .

(6.29)

(6.30)

(6.31)

also, as in the semiabelian case, there are the additional primary constraints (5.5) stating that
the momenta 
 vanish. the secondary, or gauss law, constraints (5.6) now
become

 conjugate to a

(gd1g)m + + f (g)m + b k b  0 ,

while the hamiltonian is given by

h =

1

2 z dx ab(g) (cid:18)(g1d0g)a(g1d0g)b + (g1d1g)a(g1d1g)b(cid:19)

we can use (6.30) to reexpress (g1d0g)a in h in terms of phase space coordinates.

(6.32)

(6.33)

now let us proceed with the constraint analysis. as in the semiabelian case, a

nondynamical, and thus they may be eliminated and 0
the constraints (6.31), along with 1
going to the constrained surface. for this we introduce dirac variables k i and g,

0 are
 may be strongly set equal to zero.
  0, form a second class set, and they are eliminated by

k i = k i  ci
j

k j1


g = g (1) ,


1


1 = e ,

(6.34)

where (1) takes values in g and we assume it to be weakly equal to the identity element.
it is easily checked that these variables have (weakly) zero poisson brackets with (6.31) and
  0. moreover, the algebra of dirac variables is identical to that of k i and g. thus the
1
cotangent bundle algebra is preserved upon projecting onto the constraint surface, and we
recover (6.13). finally, we note that the remaining set of constraints (6.32) agree with (6.19)
upon using (6.31). the hamiltonian (6.33) is equivalent to (6.18) provided that the dual metric
 and antisymmetric tensor  are once again given by the expressions (4.14). now, of course,
f is, in general, not a linear function of the scalar elds, but rather is given by (6.15). we note
that the identity (4.15) still holds in this case.

to summarize, the solution for the metric  and antisymmetric tensor  (6.12) in the
primary lagrangian are expressed in terms of the functions f (g), while their dual counterparts
 and  (4.14) expressed in terms of f (g). by comparing these expressions, we see that a
duality transformation corresponds to

g 

1


g1 ,

f (g)  f (g) .

(6.35)

19

the duality transformation for coset theories is, however, more involved then this, since it
also requires replacing the ordinary derivatives appearing in the primary lagrangian with
covariant derivatives (6.22) in the dual lagrangian, as well as, including a topological term.
the lagrangian (2.8) and its dual (6.26) are valid for any pair (g, g) of isotropic subgroups
of the drinfeld double group gd, and for any subgroup h of g, provided the restrictions
(2.3), (2.4), (6.3) on the structure constants and invariant metric on g hold. conditions (2.3)
and (2.4) were necessary already in the semiabelian case. condition (6.3) implied that g has
a subgroup h of dimension dim[ h] = dim[g]  dim[h]. it is curious that we end up with
complimentary subgroups in g and g. in our formalism, however, h plays a dierent role than
h, since it is not gauged. of course, provided that there is a metric on g which is invertible
and block diagonal, we can reverse the roles of the two subgroups, gauging h and not h.
then the gauge group would have a linear action on g, and a nonlinear one on g. a more
intriguing possibility would be if we gauged part (i.e. a subgroup) of h and part of h. then
the primary and dual lagrangians would have both a linear and nonlinear realization of the
full gauge symmetry.
