abstract

we derive the rules to construct type iib compact orientifolds in six and four

dimensions including d-branes and anti-d-branes. even though the models

are non-supersymmetric due to the presence of the anti-d-branes, we show

that it is easy to construct large classes of models free of tachyons. brane-

antibrane annihilation can be prevented for instance by considering models

with branes and antibranes stuck at dierent xed points in the compact

space. we construct several anomaly-free and tachyon-free six-dimensional

orientifolds containing d9-branes and anti-d5-branes. this setup allows to

construct four-dimensional chiral models with supersymmetry unbroken in the

bulk and in some d-brane sectors, whereas supersymmetry is broken (at the

string scale) in some hidden anti-d-brane sector. we present several explicit

models of this kind. we also comment on the role of the non-cancelled at-

tractive brane-antibrane forces and the non-vanishing cosmological constant,

as providing interesting dynamics for the geometric moduli and the dilaton,

which may contribute to their stabilization.

1 introduction

the last two years have witnessed an increased interest on non-supersymmetric string

theory compactications and non-supersymmetric states in string theory. this has

led to a number of interesting developments. for instance, the construction of non-

supersymmetric string vacua with vanishing or extremely suppressed cosmological con-

stant [1]. another example is the study of tachyon condensation in brane-antibrane

systems and its relation to stable non-bps states in string theory [2]. hopefully these

and other developments will provide new insights into the possible mechanisms break-

ing supersymmetry in realistic compactications of string theory.

one of the most interesting classes of string theory vacua is that of type iib orien-

tifolds [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. supersymmetric compact orientifolds in six [6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12]

and four [13, 14, 15, 16, 9] dimensions have been constructed and studied extensively.

they show several interesting properties, both from the theoretical and the phenomeno-

logical points of view. within the latter, we may highlight the fact that they provide

explicit string theory models where gauge elds and charged matter are localized on

d-branes, whereas gravity and other closed string modes propagate in full spacetime.

this idea has recently received a great deal of attention, in particular in the context

of compactications with large [17, 18], intermediate [19] or largish [20] compact di-

mensions. it is natural to wonder about possible supersymmetry breaking mechanisms

in these scenarios.

several possibilities to achieve the construction of non-supersymmetric orientifold

vacua have been explored in the literature. for instance, one possibility is to implement

the scherk-schwarz mechanism [21] in the context of type iib orientifolds [22]. a

dierent approach would consist of constructing orientifolds of non-supersymmetric

string theories, as in type 0b orientifolds in [23].

in this paper we would like to point out a dierent possibility. non-supersymmetric

type iib orientifolds can be easily obtained by introducing anti-d-branes in the model.

this framework has several built-in advantages. for example, since the orientifold pro-

jections on the closed string spectrum preserve some of the supersymmetries, closed

string tachyons are automatically absent. perhaps a bit more surprisingly, open string

tachyons (arising from open strings stretched between branes and antibranes) are also

easily avoided, for instance by choosing chan-paton embeddings that project out the

tachyon of coincident branes and antibranes, or by locating the branes and antibranes

stuck at dierent xed points in the internal space. therefore, large classes of tachyon-

free non-supersymmetric type iib orientifolds can be constructed in six and four di-

1

mensions. a nice feature that arises in some four-dimensional models is that they can

include chiral n = 1 supersymmetric sectors of d-branes and non-supersymmetric sec-

tors of anti-d-branes, spatially separated in the compact space. this leads to explicit

string theory models where supersymmetry breaking (at the string scale) occurs in a

distant brane and is transmitted to the visible supersymmetric sector, either by bulk

modes (gravity-mediated models) or by a gauge sector on other d-branes coupling to

both branes and antibranes (gauge-mediated).

these models also present interesting properties from the theoretical point of view.

for instance we show that certain non-supersymmetric compactication of type i on

orbifold limits of k3 are related by t-duality to analogous compactication of the

ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric usp(32) theory constructed in [24].

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we provide the basic rules to

construct type iib orbifold and orientifold models including antibranes, and compute

the spectrum of tachyons and massless states. this allows to derive conditions under

which the open string tachyons are absent. we also discuss the rr tadpole cancellation

conditions for these models.

in section 3 we present several examples of non-supersymmetric type iib orien-

tifolds in six dimensions. we discuss how some naively stable models, without tachyons

but in which the antibranes can move o the xed points into the bulk, can actually

decay to supersymmetric theories through brane-antibrane annihilation. we also show

how the introduction of antibranes in some cases allows to satisfy tadpole conditions

which cannot be fullled in supersymmetric models with only d-branes. we illustrate
this property by constructing orientifolds of type iib on t 4/zn, n = 2, 4, 6, with

vector structure.

in section 4, we present four-dimensional examples based on the z

6 and z3 orien-

tifolds, which have unbroken n = 1 supersymmetry in the closed string sector and in

several d-brane sectors, and non-supersymmetric sectors of anti-d-branes.

section 5 contains our nal remarks and speculations concerning the role of the

non-supersymmetric dynamics in stabilizing the geometric moduli and the dilaton in

these models.

while we were completing the present paper, we noticed reference [25], where one

of the models presented in section 3.1 is constructed using slightly dierent techniques.

2 general construction

2.1 generalities of type iib orientifolds

in this section we summarize the basic ingredients [3, 6, 7, 9] and notation needed for
the construction of n = 1 type iib orientifolds 1.

a type iib orbifold is obtained when the toroidally compactied theory is divided

out by discrete symmetry group g1, (like zn or zn zm). the orbifold twist eigenval-
ues va, associated to a complex compact coordinate ya (a = 1, . . . , d10), are restricted
by the requirement that the orbifold group acts crystalographically on t d10 and by

the number of supersymmetries to be left unbroken. for instance for zn in d = 6 and
n = 2 unbroken supersymmetries we must have v = 1
n (1, 1). the same requirement
in d = 4 is satised by v = 1
n (1, 2, 3) with 1 + 2 + 3 = 0, where a are some specic

integers [26].

a type iib orientifold results from the joint action of the orbifold group g1 together
with a world sheet parity operation , exchanging left and right movers. by keeping

orientation reversal invariant states, supersymmetry is reduced by a half.  action

can be also accompanied by extra operations thus leading to generic orientifold group
g1 + g2 with hh  g1 for h, h  g2

orientifolding closed type iib string introduces a klein-bottle unoriented world-

sheet. amplitudes on such a surface contain tadpole divergences. tadpoles may be

generically interpreted as unbalanced orientifold plane charges under rr form po-

tentials.

in order to eliminate such unphysical divergences dp-branes, which carry

opposite charges, must be generically introduced. in this way, divergences occurring in

the open string sector cancel up the closed sector ones and produce a consistent theory.

we will focus our discussion in d = 6, 4 dimensional theories.

for zn, with n odd, only d9-branes are required. they ll the full space-time and

the compact space. for n even, d5-branes are required. their world-volume lls up

the space-time in six dimensions.

d5k-branes, with world volume lling space-time and the kth complex plane, may
be required. this is so whenever the orientifold group contains the element rirj, for
k 6= i, j. here ri (rj) is an order two twist of the ith (jth) complex plane.

open string states are denoted by |, abi, where  refers to world-sheet degrees of

freedom while the a, b chan-paton indices are associated to the open string endpoints

lying on dp-branes and dq-branes respectively.

1in the orientifolds we consider in coming sections, supersymmetry is preserved in the closed string
sector, and is only broken in the open string sector by the presence of the anti-d-branes. hence most

of the usual techniques in supersymmetric orientifolds apply.

3

these chan-paton labels must be contracted with a hermitian matrix pq

ab. the
action of an element of the orientifold group on chan-paton factors is achieved by a
unitary matrix g,p such that g : pg  g,ppq1
g,q . we denote by k,p the matrix
associated to the zn orbifold twist k acting on a dp-brane.

consistency under group transformations imposes restrictions on the representa-

tions g. for instance, from 2 = 1 it follows that

,p = t
,p

also group operation (k)2 = 2k and (2.3) lead to

 
k,p =  

,p k,p,p

(2.1)

(2.2)

for p = 9, 5.

tadpole cancellation imposes further constraints on g (see for instance [8, 9] and

references therein).

in what follows we will make a denite choice of signs in (2.1), namely

,9 = t
,9
,5 = t
,5

(2.3)

for  acting on 9 and on 5-branes. the rst condition is the usual requirement of

global consistency of the ten-form potential in type i theory. second equation is in

agreement with the gimon and polchinski action, analyzed in [7].

generic matrices satisfying above constraints can be provided. namely, for a zn

orbifold twist action, with n = 2p (n = 2p + 1) we dene

1,p = (1,p,  

1,p)

(2.4)

by

then (2.3) and (2.2) (with +() sign for d9(5)-brane respectively) are satised .

the open string spectrum is constructed by requiring the states |, abiab to be
invariant under the action of the orientifold group. we present the general rules in the

following section.

2.2 open string spectrum with branes and antibranes

in this section we discuss the rules to construct the spectrum of tachyonic and massless

states in the open string sector, in orientifolds containing both d-branes and anti-d-

branes (denoted d-branes in what follows). even though several of the models we are

going to construct are six-dimensional, it will be convenient to derive the spectrum
for a general four-dimensional twist v = (v1, v2, v3) = 1
n (1, 2, 3). the rules for six-
dimensional models are recovered by setting v3 = 0 and v1 = v2 = 1/n, and by
taking into account that there are two additional spacetime dimensions.

we start by reviewing the supersymmetric sectors.

(2.7)

in the r sector, states are labeled by weights |  1

four left-handed spacetime spinors, whose chan-paton factors (0), (a) suer the pro-

jections (2.7). right-handed fermions suer the opposite projection and provide their

antiparticles. bosonic and fermionic states form multiplets of n = 1 supersymmetry.

the 55 sector

the structure of the 55 sector ressembles that of the 99. the only dierence arises

in the  projection, which acts with +1 sign on states associated to complex planes

with dirichlet boundary conditions. the projection for d53-branes are given by

with positive sign for a = 1, 2 and negative for a = 3. the projections being identical

for bosonic and fermionic states, they form n = 1 supermultiplets.

the 59+95 sector

in the ns sector there are zero modes along the directions with dn boundary
conditions, hence, states are labeled by an internal so(4) spinor weight |s1, s2i, with
si =  1
2. the gso projection requires s1 = s2. the orbifold projection imposes the
following projection on the chan-paton factors of 59 and 95 states

59 = e2i(v1+v2)/2 ,5 59 1

95 = e2i(v1+v2)/2 ,9 95 1

the zero modes in the r sector arise along the directions with nn boundary con-

ditions. states are labeled by an so(4) spinor weight |s3; s0i, where s0 determines the
spacetime fermion chirality. the gso projection requires s0 = s3. the projection for
these states is

the 99, 55, and 59 + 95 sectors.

let us move on to the projection for open string states in antibrane-antibrane

sectors.

in these sectors the gso projection is the same as in brane-brane sectors.

the only dierence with respect to the 55, 99 and 59+95 sectors arises in the action

of the orientifold projection on the r states, which has an additional (1) factor. the

orientifold projection on the ns states remains unchanged. this fact has been discussed

in [24], and reects the fact that the orientifold projection distinguishes branes from

antibranes. in particular, it respects the supersymmetries unbroken by the former and

broken by the latter. notice that this sign ip has no net eect on the spectrum in the
59, 95 sectors, since they are not xed under .

finally, let us discuss the mixed brane-antibrane and antibrane-brane sectors. as

compared with the analogous brane-brane (or antibrane-antibrane) sectors, they have

the opposite gso projection.

the 99 + 99 sectors.

in the ns sector the tachyon |0, abi(t)ab survives the gso projection, whereas the
|0i do not. the orbifold projection on the chan-paton

(2.11)

since  relates the 99 and 99 sectors, the tachyons are real elds. the conditions under
which the orientifolds are free of tachyons will be discussed below.

in the r sector, the gso projection selects so(8) weight vectors | 1

actually,  relates states in the 99 and 99, so it is enough to compute only one of these
sectors.

the 55 + 55 sector.

the spectrum in this sector is completely analogous to that in the 99+99 sector. the
only dierence, as we may recall from the comparison of 55 and 99 sectors, might arise

in the projection imposed by  in directions with d boundary conditions. however,
since  does not impose any projection on either the 55 or the 55 sectors (rather it
maps one to the other), no such dierence arises at the level of the spectrum.

the 95 + 59 and 95 + 59 sectors.

these sectors are analogous to the 59 + 95 sector, with a few modications due only
to the opposite gso projections. the ns states are labeled by a weight vector |s1, s2i
with respect to the so(4) corresponding to the dn directions. the gso projection in
this case selects s1 = s2. the projections on the chan-paton factors of these states
in the 95 + 59 sector are

95 = e2i(v1v2)/2 ,9 95 1

the  projection relates the 95 and the 59 sectors. the projections in the 95 + 59
sector are completely analogous.

states in the r sector are labelled by an so(4) spinor weight |s3; s0i, with s3 = s0
due to the gso projection, and where s0 denes the spacetime chirality. the projection

analogously.

in order to illustrate the kind of states survive the projections, let us consider

chan-paton matrices of the form

,9 = diag (1v0, e2i 1

n 1v1, . . . , e2i n 1

n 1vn 1)

(2.15)

and analogous expressions for d9-, d5- and d5-branes, with the numbers of entries

replaced by wi, ni and mi, respectively. we must clarify, however, that our projection
rules do not depend on the specic form of these matrices.
indeed, in some of our

models the chan-paton matrices will dier from the expression above.

the states resulting from the orbifold projection with such matrices are shown in

table 1. the subindices denote the gauge group under which the state transforms.

they are dened mod n, hence for negative indices we have vi = vn i. the choice
of fermions chiralities is mainly the usual one for supersymmetric sectors. in brane-

antibrane sectors, the opposite chirality arises from the opposite gso projection. the

orientifold projection will impose additional conditions on these states in some of the

sectors, indicated with an asterisk. for sectors exchanged by the orientifold projection

only one of them is shown. for these states the orientifold projection does not impose

additional constraints.

one important point to be stressed is that tachyons only appear when the model

contains coincident (or very close) branes of the same type and with identical chan-

paton phases. those tachyons obviously signal instabilities due to brane-antibrane

annihilation. therefore the construction of type iib orientifolds with branes and an-

tibranes but without tachyons is fairly simple. it only requires that branes and an-

tibranes sit at dierent points in the internal space (or have dierent wilson lines, in a

in sections 3 and 4 we give explicit examples of tachyon-free models, and comment on

some of their properties.

2.3 cylinder partition function

in this section we indicate how the open string spectrum derived above shows up in the

cylinder partition functions (see also [24, 27]). we include it here in order to provide

a cross check for the correctness of the construction in section 2.1, and also in order

to illustrate how dierent signs must be suitable ipped, in a concrete amplitude,

in order to take the presence of anti-branes into account. we also show how rr

tadpole cancellation is achieved by performing the usual transformation to the closed

string channel. we restrict our analysis to congurations containing d9-branes and

9

d9-branes. other amplitudes can be similarly analyzed.

the number of states at each mass level m can be obtained by looking at the
(q = e2t) in the partition function. we will be interested

multiplicity of the term qm 2

rr tadpole cancellation

cancellation of rr tadpoles is a basic requirement for the consistency of the the-

ory. in type iib theory with only d-branes (no anti-branes), tadpole cancellation is

equivalent to anomaly cancellation in d = 10, 6 dimensions, however, it is generally

stronger in d = 4 [29]. also, if rr tadpoles are absent so must be ns tadpoles due to

supersymmetry. this last result is thus not expected in models with anti-branes where

supersymmetry is broken. ns tadpoles should manifest as a background redenition

[30].

in order to analyze the tadpole divergences it is useful to rewrite the partition

function as

nevertheless we note that, regarding tadpole cancellation, the net eect of the intro-

duction of anti d9-branes, with respect to type iib theory with only d9-branes, is

that we must replace

for instance, in a six-dimensional type iib orbifold compactication (non orientifold

yet), the only tadpoles arise from cylinder amplitudes. the corresponding equations

can be extracted from [8] and lead to

tr k,9  tr k,9  4 sin2 k
n

( tr k,5,l  tr k,5,l ) = 0

(2.35)

for 5, 5-branes at orbifold xed point l.

notice that by computing the traces as in (2.26), these equations are equivalent to

(we have dropped the l index for mi, ni here)

 2ni + ni+1 + ni1 + vi + 2mi  mi+1  mi1 = 0

(2.36)

precisely, these are the conditions for cancellation of anomalies of the six dimensional

gauge theories living on branes and anti-branes with the spectrum computed in section

2.1 (before the orientifold projection).

it is also possible to show that the green-schwarz mechanism that cancels the resid-

ual anomalies in six [31, 32] and four [33] dimensions works in models with antibranes.

in this respect, it is important to notice that the fermions in brane-antibrane sectors

have chirality opposite to that of usual matter fermions in supersymmetric models.

hence their contribution to the anomaly has the opposite sign as well. this sign also

emerges in the gs counterterms because the coupling of antibranes to rr elds is

opposite to that of branes. hence cancellation follows in the usual way. for antibrane-

antibrane sectors, fermions have the usual chirality, and the gs countertems also have

the usual sign (since the 1 signs of the two antibrane couplings give an overall +1).

13

3 some six-dimensional examples

in this section we construct several explicit non-supersymmetric type iib orientifolds in

six dimensions with chiral spectrum. these models are free of tachyons, and illustrate a

number of interesting generic features of compactications with branes and antibranes.

also, since chiral theories are potentially anomalous in six dimensions, the cancellation

of anomalies in the models we present serves as a useful check of the rules proposed to

construct the spectrum in section 2.

3.1 a non-supersymmetric z3 model

a simple possibility to obtain non-supersymmetric models is to modify slightly one

of the familiar supersymmetric compactications by the introduction of antibranes, in

a way consistent with cancellation of rr tadpoles.

in order to illustrate the basic

idea, let us consider a simple model related to the six-dimensional z3 model in [8].
the construction will be mostly intuitive in terms of a t-dual version, where t 4/z3 is

modded out by r1r2, and the model contains no d9-branes. it contains d5-branes
(and d5-branes) sitting at points in the compact space. as discussed in section 2.2,

the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions for the branes at the origin are obtained
from those in [8] by replacing tr k,5  tr k,5  tr k5, so we have

tr ,5  tr ,5 = 8

tr 2,5  tr 2,5 = 8

these can be satised, for instance, by choosing

,5 = 14

;

,5 = diag (e2i 1

3 14, e2i 2

3 14)

(3.1)

(3.2)

the matrices r1r2 simply exchanges opposite phases in . the untwisted tadpole
requires a net d5-brane number of 32, n5  n5 = 32, and so the model must contain
additional d5-branes. let us consider placing 18 d5-branes at one of the orbifold

(rather than orientifold) points xed under z3, and another set of 18 at its image under

r1r2. for an orbifold point, twisted tadpole conditions amount to tracelessness of
the relevant chan-paton matrices. therefore these d5-branes are described by

,5 = diag (16, e2i 1

3 16, e2i 2

3 16)

(3.3)

the d5-branes sitting at the orbifold xed points give a d = 6, n = 1 spectrum with
group u(6)3, and hypermultiplets in ( ,

, ) + ( , 1, ).

, 1) + (1,

since the orientifold projection on the closed string sector is exactly that in [8], it

gives rise to the d = 6, n = 1 supergravity and dilaton multiplets, and the following

set of d = 6, n = 1 matter multiplets: two hypermultiplets in the untwisted sector,

and nine hyper- and nine tensor multiplets in the twisted sectors. it is easy to check that

both gauge and gravitational irreducible anomalies cancel in the model. as usual, the

residual non-abelian and u(1) anomalies are cancelled by the gs mechanism mediated

by the tensor and hypermultiplets [31, 32].

this theory can be thought of as a toy model where we have a supersymmetric sector

of branes and a non-supersymmetric sector containing antibranes. supersymmetry

breaking would be transmitted from the latter to the former by exchange of bulk

elds. however, the model suers from the following serious drawback. as discussed

in a number of papers (see e.g.

[34]), the lack of bps properties in brane-antibrane

systems leads to an attractive force between the two kinds of objects. in brane-brane (or

antibrane-antibrane) systems, the repulsive force mediated by exchange of rr closed

string elds is exactly cancelled by that from exchange of ns-ns elds, leading to no

net force. in brane-antibranes systems, however, the rr piece becomes attractive and

branes and antibranes tend to come close to each other. once the distance reaches a

critical value, a tachyon develops, signaling the possibility of annihilation and decay to

the vacuum. this type of phenomenon takes place in the model we have constructed.

indeed, the d5-branes sitting at the z3 orbifold point are not stuck to it, and are free

to move into the bulk as a dynamical d5-brane. this transition very likely takes place

due to the attractive force induced by the d5-branes located (and actually, stuck) at

the origin. once in the bulk, the d5-branes approach the origin, tachyons develop,

branes and antibranes annihilate and the theory decays to the supersymmetric model

3notice that the projection with r1r2 has some additional (1) signs as compared with the 

projection.

15

in [8], where the chan-paton matrices for d5-branes are

,5 = diag (116, e2i 1

3 18, e2i 2

3 18)

(3.5)

therefore, the initial mode should be thought of as an excited non-supersymmetric

state of this supersymmetric vacuum.

it is straightforward to construct this type

of non-supersymmetric compactications, by nucleating brane-antibrane pairs in any

supersymmetric model, and separating the members of these pairs. since this type of

models is not really new or interesting for our purposes, the models we construct in

the following will be safe against this type of decay. this can be achieved, as we show

in section 4 by considering branes and antibranes stuck at dierent xed points. a

dierent possibility is to consider branes and antibranes with dierent world-volume

dimension (since tachyons only appear in pp sectors). models of this kind are presented

in next subsection.

3.2 non-supersymmetric models with vector structure

in this section we construct a dierent kind of models, quite unrelated to supersymmet-

ric orientifolds. they illustrate the fact that the introduction of antibranes sometimes

allows to satisfy rr tadpole cancellation conditions which could not be satised in

supersymmetric models containing only d-branes.

the models we consider are obtained by modding out type iib theory on t 4/zn
(with n = 2, 4, 6) by an orientifold projection  that preserves d = 6, n = 1 super-

symmetry in the closed string spectrum. the orientifold projection we are interested in

discussing, however, diers from that in [8] and was rst discussed in [35]. concretely,

its action on the order two twisted sector of zn is such that the rr states are left-right

symmetric (rather than antisymmetric) combinations. in other words, the orientifold

projection gives rise to a tensor multiplet (rather than a hypermultiplet) in the z2

twisted sectors. this projection imposes a constraint on the chan-paton matrices of

the corresponding twist [35]

 = n/2t

n/2

(3.6)

for d9- and d5-branes (and also for antibranes). the constraint implies the bundles

on the d-branes have vector structure (see [32] for a discussion of vector structure

in orientifold models). this type of projection was studied in [36, 37] in the context
of orientifolds of c2/zn, which provide a local description of the xed point of the

compact models.

16

it is not possible to construct a supersymmetric orientifold of t 4/zn where all xed
points are of this type 4. the reason is that the cancellation of the untwisted tadpole
generated by the orientifold planes requires n5 = 32. clearly it is not possible to
cancel this tadpole by introducing d5-branes. however, as we show below, it is certainly

possible to construct consistent tachyon-free non-supersymmetric models, where this

tadpole is neatly cancelled by the introduction of 32 d5-branes. untwisted tadpoles

also require n9 = 32, as in the usual case. in these models, tachyons are absent because
branes and antibranes have dierent world-volume dimension, hence no anihilation is

possible.

before entering the detailed construction of the model, let us introduce some con-

ventions, which dier slightly from those in section 2.1. the chan-paton matrices for

the twist  will be of the form

,9 = diag (1v0, e2i 1

n 1v1, . . . , e2i n 1

n 1vn 1)

(3.7)

(and analogously for ,5), with vi = vn i due to the orientifold symmetry. the
matrices ,9 will be of the form

,9 =

,5 =

these conventions are useful to make contact with [36, 37], where the twisted tadpoles

for these orientifolds were computed. the general expression can be extracted from
these references 5

tr k,9 + 4 sin2 k
n

tr k,5  32k,0 mod 2 = 0

(3.8)

for branes at zn xed points. since these models are in a sense the simplest six-

dimensional compactications with vector structure, we now turn to the explicit con-

struction of the z2, z4 and z6 models.

4it is however possible to construct mixed models with xed points of dierent kinds, see [35] for

a z2 example.

5the tadpole conditions in [36] are slightly dierent due to a dierent form of the matrices . our
expression is taken from section 3.2 in [37], with the only modications of multiplying the crosscap

by a factor of 4 (since our models are six-dimensional rather than four-dimensional) and replacing
tr k,5 by tr k,5.

17

3.2.1 the z2 model

consider modding out type iib on t 4/z2 by the orientifold projection  that selects

the tensor multiplet in all z2 twisted sectors. the closed string spectrum gives a set

of d = 6, n = 1 multiplets, concretely 4 hypermultiplets in the untwisted sector and

16 tensor multiplets in the twisted sector.

concerning the open string spectrum, we consider, as discussed above, n9 = n5 = 32
to satisfy the untwisted tadpoles. we will also consider the model where all the d5-

branes sit at one z2 xed point. other models can be constructed analogously. rr

tadpoles for such conguration are cancelled by choosing

,9 = diag (116, 116)

,5 = diag (116, 116)

(3.9)

the gauge group is [so(16)  so(16)]99  [usp(16)  usp(16)]55. the matter content
arising from the projections in section 2 is

(3.10)

here the 120 of usp(16) is actually reducible as 119 + 1. also, the factor 1

2 in
front of some fermion representations implies they have a (symplectic) majorana-weyl

constraint, which is possible because they transform in pseudoreal representations of the

gauge group (these are the fermions appearing in the more familiar half-hypermultiplets

of d = 6, n = 1 supersymmetric models).

it is easy to check that all irreducible gauge and gravitational anomalies cancel in

the model above. as usual, we expect the residual non-abelian and u(1) anomalies to

be cancelled through a green-schwarz mechanism [31].

3.2.2 the z4 model

let us discuss the construction of a orientifold of t 4/z4 by this orientifold projection.
in the closed string sector we obtain a set of d = 6, n = 1 multiplets. specically,

18

the untwisted sector provides two hypermultiplets. concerning the twisted sector, the
model contains four c2/z4 xed points, each of which contributes with one hyper-
and two tensor multiplets, and six c2/z2, each contributing with one tensor multiplet.

hence we get 6 hyper- and 14 tensor multiplets.

regarding the open string sector, untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions require

n9 = n5 = 32.
conditions do not have solutions if all d5-branes are located at a single xed point.

it is possible to show that in the z4 model tadpole cancellation

however, if we place d5-branes at all four z4 xed points, it is possible to solve the

tadpole conditions. in what follows we describe a simple solution, even though there

are other possibilities.

let us consider the d9-branes to be described by the following chan-paton matrix

,9 = diag (18, e2i 1

4 18, e2i 2

4 18, e2i 3

(3.11)

we also consider a set of 8 d5-branes sitting at each of the four z4 xed points labeled

by l = 1, . . . , 4. their chan-paton matrix is

,5,l = diag (14, e2i 2

4 14)

these choices satisfy the tadpole conditions (3.8) at each z4 xed point.

(3.13)

(3.14)

where the 6 of usp(4) is actually reducible as 5 + 1. it is easy to see that the complete

open and closed string spectrum cancels all gauge and gravitational anomalies.

3.2.3 the z6 model

let us consider the six-dimensional z6 model, with the orientifold projections selecting

the tensor multiplets in z2 twisted sectors. the closed string sector gives rise to a set

19

of d = 6, n = 1 multiplets. there are two hypermultiplets arising from the untwisted
sector. the model contains one c2/z6 xed points, which contributes two hyper- and
three tensor multiplets, four c2/z3 orbifold points, contributing one hyper- and one
tensor multiplet each, and ve c2/z2 points, contributing one tensor multiplet each.

we have a total of 8 hyper- and 12 tensor multiplets.

concerning the open string spectrum, we have as usual n9 = n5 = 32.

in this

case there are solutions to the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions with all d5-

branes sitting at the origin. the general solution for the chan-paton matrices in such

conguration is

,9 = diag (12k, e2i 1
,5 = diag (1162k, e2i 1

a particularly nice solution is obtained for k = 4, on which we center for the sake of

case is

the 28 of usp(8) decomposes as 27 + 1. again one can check that all gauge and

gravitational anomalies cancel.

3.2.4 t-duality and the usp(32) string theory

we conclude this section by commenting briey on an interesting point, concerning the

t-duals of the models we have just constructed. notice that the action of t-duality on

anti-d-branes is the same as for d-branes. therefore, if we perform a t-duality along

the four compact directions in the orientifolds of the previous subsections, we obtain a

set of models with 32 d9-branes and 32 d5-branes, giving rise to the spectra we have

presented.

it seems striking to encounter consistent models with 32 d9-branes, since in usual

type iib orientifolds, cancellation of untwisted tadpoles imposes the presence of either

32 d9-branes (if  belongs to the orientifold group) or no d9-branes (if it does not).

however, reference [24] discussed the existence of an  projection of ten-dimensional

type iib string theory, such that the rr charge of the corresponding crosscaps (that

is, the charge of the o9-plane) is opposite to the usual one. cancellation of tadpoles

in this model requires the introduction of 32 units of d9-brane charge, which can

be minimally accomplished by introducing 32 d9-branes. this construction leads to

a ten-dimensional tachyon-free non-supersymmetric string theory of open and closed

unoriented strings, with usp(32) gauge group. clearly, the t-duals of the models we

have constructed in the previous section correspond to compactications (with vector
structure) of this ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric on t 4/zn spaces.
in other
words, they correspond to modding out type iib theory on t 4/zn, by the orientifold

action  introduced in [24].

the t-duality relation between the type iib orientifolds of the previous subsections

and the type iib orientifolds with the  projection in [24] seems to suggest interesting

relations between the so(32) and usp(32) theories, at least, after compactication.

it would be important to gain a better understanding of such relations. certainly,

the construction of further examples of six-dimensional consistent compactications of

both theories will provide new insights into these issues. we hope our techniques are

useful in these investigations.

4 four-dimensional models

in this section we present some examples of four-dimensional type iib orientifolds

containing branes and antibranes. the models are tachyon-free and give rise to chiral

spectra. the class of models that can be constructed is presumably very large. the

examples we present have been selected to illustrate the following interesting possibility,

21

which has direct application in phenomenological model building.

it is possible to

construct explicit type iib orientifolds where n = 1 chiral supersymmetric sectors

of d-branes are spatially separated (in the internal space) from non-supersymmetric

sectors of anti-d-branes. this type of models provides an explicit realization of the

supersymmetry breaking scenario where the standard model is embedded in a set of

supersymmetric branes, whereas supersymmetry is broken (in our case, at the string

scale) in a hidden sector of antibranes. this scenario could be phenomenologically

viable for suitable choices of the string and compactication scales, and ts nicely into

the circle of ideas recently developed about string theory vacua with large or largish

dimensions [17, 18, 19, 20].

4.1 a z

6 model with non-supersymmetric and supersymmet-

ric sectors

here we describe a chiral tachyon free four-dimensional example with n = 1 super-

symmetric sectors, and non-supersymmetric hidden sectors. branes and antibranes

are stuck at dierent xed points in the compact space and are unable to move o into

the bulk. therefore, the model is stable against the kind of annihilation and decay

mentioned in section 3.1.

the model is based on the z

6 orientifold, with twist v = (1, 3, 2)/6. we will

make use of the property, discussed in [9, 29], that tadpoles can be satised placing

d53-branes (and in our case, also d53-branes) at dierent xed points in the second
complex plane.

let us consider the following chan-paton matrix for the d9-branes

,9 = diag (ei 1

6 14, ei 3

6 18, ei 5

6 14, ei 7

6 14, ei 9

6 18, ei 11

6 14)

(4.1)

let us also place some d5-branes at the origin in the second complex plane, with

chan-paton factors

,5,0 = diag (ei 1

6 14, ei 5

6 14, ei 7

6 14, ei 11

6 14)

we place d5-branes at another xed point, labeled 1, with matrices

,5,1 = diag (ei 3

6 1r, ei 9

6 1r)

and some d5-branes at yet another xed point, labeled 2, with matrices

,5,2 = diag (ei 3

6 18+r, ei 9

6 18+r)

22

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

the matrices  are dened following the conventions in section 2.1.

the choice of matrices above is just a small variation of the model in [9], and

satises the tadpole conditions. the spectrum in the 99 sector is the following n = 1

theory

u(4)  u(8)  u(4)

(6, 1, 1) + (4, 8, 1) + (1, 8, 4) + (1, 1, 6) + (4, 8, 1)+

+(4, 1, 4) + (1, 8, 4) + (4, 1, 4) + (4, 1, 4) + (1, 28, 1) + (1, 28, 1)

(4.5)

the d5-branes at the origin form a n = 1 supersymmetric sector. for instance, their

55 strings gives the following n = 1 supersymmetric spectrum

u(4)  u(4)

(6, 1) + (1, 6) + (4, 4) + (4, 4) + (4, 4)

(4.6)

the corresponding 59 matter is given by the n = 1 chiral multiplets

(4, 1; 4, 1, 1) + (1, 4; 1, 8, 1) + (1, 4; 1, 1, 4) + (4, 1; 1, 8, 1)

(4.7)

the d5-branes at the xed point labeled 2 also give an n = 1 sector, as follows

u(8 + r)

+

( ; 4, 1, 1) + ( ; 1, 1, 4)

55

59

(4.8)

finally, the d5-branes give a gauge group u(r) with the following non-supersymmetric

matter content

it is easy to check that non-abelian anomalies cancel. also, u(1) anomalies should

cancelled by the gs mechanism proposed in [33].

this model provides a specic realization of a scenario where supersymmetry is

broken explicitly at the string scale in an anti-d-brane hidden sector, distant from the

n = 1 chiral supersymmetric sector. we expect this model to belong to a more general

class of explicit type iib orientifold realizing this type of scenario. hopefully, this class

of models may include theories with more realistic spectra.

in the model we have constructed, if the standard model would be embedded in

one of the supersymmetric d5-brane sectors, supersymmetry breaking would be felt

23

through loops involving states in the 99 and 95 sectors. therefore, supersymmetry
it should not be particularly dicult to construct ex-
breaking is gauge-mediated.

amples where the supersymmetry breaking is gravity-mediated. this could be accom-

plished, for instance, by introducing wilson lines that project all 59 states in the visible

sector out.

as mentioned above, branes and antibranes in the model are stuck at xed points in
the compact space, and therefore cannot move o to the bulk and lead to annihilation6.

however, there exist non-cancelled forces between the branes and antibranes, whose

strength depends on the distances between the corresponding xed points. another

interesting feature of this models is that by increasing r the gauge groups in the model

can be made as large as desired, with no apparent inconsistency. the only prize to

pay would be an increase in the vacuum energy of the model (cosmological constant)

since, roughly speaking, r controls the number of excess brane-antibrane pairs. in our

nal remarks we speculate on the possible role these two dynamical issues may play in

moduli stabilization.

4.2 a z3 example with non-supersymmetric and supersym-

metric sectors

it is easy to construct further examples of four-dimensional models with supersym-

metric and non-supersymmetric sectors. here we discuss a model based on the z3

orientifold [14]. in order to cancel the untwisted tadpole the orientifold action requires

the introduction of 32 d9-branes and zero net number of d5-branes. however, one can

introduce an equal number of d5-branes and d5-branes (wrapping, for instance, the

third complex plane) and obtain new (non-supersymmetric) consistent models. the

tadpole cancellation conditions read

tr ,9 + 3(tr ,5,l  tr ,5,l) = 4

(4.10)

for any of the nine xed points in the two rst complex planes. let us consider a

particular case, with

,9 = diag (116, e2i 1

3 18, e2i 2

3 18)

(4.11)

6upon a closer look, a possible process of anihilation may take place in the region of moduli space

where the points labeled 1 and 2 are very close, and a winding mode stretched between branes

and antibranes becomes tachyonic. even though the anihilation would involve objects at dierent

xed points, it seems to be consistent with tadpole cancellation in the nal state. this new kind of

instability is not generic and is absent in other models, in particular the z3 orientifold in the next

section.

24

that is, tr ,9 = 8. this choice implies that no xed point can be completely empty.
tachyons are most easily avoided by considering the xed points to contain only d5-

branes or only d5-branes. we label such xed points by indices m, k, respectively.
twisted tadpoles (4.10) require tr ,5,m = 4, tr ,5,k = 4, therefore

,5,m = diag (1nm , e2i 1
,5,k = diag (1mk +4, e2i 1

3 1nm +4, e2i 2
3 1mk , e2i 2

3 1nm +4)

3 1mk )

since no net d5-brane charge is allowed

xm

(3nm + 8) = xk

(3mk + 4)

(4.12)

(4.13)

a particular solution is obtained by choosing nm = 0, mk = 0, and three xed points
containing only d5-branes, and six with only d5-branes. this choice has the virtue

that all branes and antibranes are stuck at the xed points.

the spectrum in the general case can be computed using our rules. since it is not

particularly interesting, we spare the reader these details. let us just mention that the

gauge group of the model is

so(16)  u(8) ym

[ usp(nm )  u(nm + 4) ] yk

[ usp(mk + 4)  u(mk) ] (4.14)

(4.15)

one can check that all anomalies cancel (to show that, one has to use the fact that

none of the nine xed points in the rst two complex planes is empty).

therefore we obtain a set of models with diverse numbers of supersymmetric and

non-supersymmetric sectors. most of the comments in the previous section apply

to these models as well, most notably the gauge-mediated nature of supersymmetry

breaking in the supersymmetric d5-brane sectors.

25

we hope the examples in this section suce to illustrate the construction of con-

sistent four-dimensional orientifolds with antibranes, and the relative ease with which

supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric sectors within the same construction can be

implemented

5 conclusions

in this paper we have provided the basic rules for the construction of type iib orien-

tifold models with branes and antibranes. the models present the attractive feature

that closed string tachyons are automatically absent, since supersymmetry is preserved

in the closed string sector. moreover, open string tachyons from strings stretching

between branes and antibranes can be avoided. therefore many new tachyon-free non-

supersymmetric models can be constructed using this simple idea. we have provided

several explicit examples in six and four dimensions, which illustrate the generic fea-

tures of these models.

a particular interesting application of these constructions, from the phenomeno-

logical viewpoint, is that they allow the presence of n = 1 supersymmetric sectors of

branes and supersymmetry breaking sectors of antibranes, spatially separated in the

compact space.

the models may also play an interesting role in the web of string dualities involving

other non-supersymmetric strings. we have discussed that type iib orientifolds on
t 4/zn with vector structure are related by t-dualtity to analogous compactications

of the non-supersymmetric usp(32) theory of [24]. we hope further research on these

vacua will uncover new interesting properties.

finally, we would like to point out two important issues we have not addressed,

concerning the dynamics of moduli of these models. as briey mentioned, branes and

antibranes in the model suer attractive forces due to the lack of supersymmetry. if

these objects are stuck at dierent xed points, their attraction presumably leads to

a potential for the compactication moduli, pushing their vevs to small radii. if the

models contain other sources of non-trivial moduli dynamics, pushing the radii to large

values, this eect would contribute to their stabilization. the second point refers to the

cosmological constant. computing the vacuum energy by simply taking into account

the tension of branes, antibranes and orientifold planes (i.e. ignoring for the moment

interaction energies), it is easy to see that the models we have discussed have a positive

cosmological constant, which is, roughly, inversely proportional to the string coupling

26

constant. even without having addressed its specic value, which furthermore would be

rather model-dependent, it is tempting to interpret this vacuum energy as a potential

for the dilaton. from that point of view, the model would force the string coupling to

become strong. if the model has sources of dilaton potential with a runaway behaviour

to small coupling (for instance, a gaugino condensate), the dilaton would be stabilized.

in any case, interesting dynamics for the moduli seems to arise from the absence of

supersymmetry. whether stabilization takes place, and whether the resulting values

for the compactication scale and string coupling are of phenomenological interest,

depends on dynamical information we have not yet studied. we hope further reseach

in these models succeeds in uncovering their rich dynamics and their phenomenological

potential.
