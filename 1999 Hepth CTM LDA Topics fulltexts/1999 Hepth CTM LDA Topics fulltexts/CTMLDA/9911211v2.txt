abstract

we evaluate the coecients of the leading poles of the complete
two-loop quark self-energy (p) in the coulomb gauge. working in the
framework of split dimensional regularization, with complex regulat-
ing parameters  and n/2   for the energy and space components of
the loop momentum, respectively, we nd that split dimensional regu-
larization leads to well-dened two-loop integrals, and that the overall
coecient of the leading pole term for (p) is strictly local. extensive
tables showing the pole parts of one- and two-loop coulomb integrals
are given. we also comment on some general implications of split di-
mensional regularization, discussing in particular the limit   1/2
and the subleading terms in the -expansion of noncovariant integrals.

1 introduction

despite serious eorts during the past twenty years to place the coulomb
gauge on the same rigorous footing as covariant gauges, we still have no con-
sistent rules for renormalizing non-abelian theories in this gauge. there can
be little doubt, however, that the coulomb gauge is superior to other gauges
in at least two respects, namely in the treatment of bound states and in the
study of connement in qcd. since these topics play a crucial role in our
understanding of the strong interactions, there is clearly a need to put this
gauge on a sound theoretical basis. to gain a better understanding of the
various advantages, as well as disadvantages, of the coulomb gauge, we refer
the reader to the vast literature on the subject. (for some recent references
see, for example, refs. [1][9].)
unfortunately, progress in the coulomb gauge continues to be hampered
by the operator ordering problem in the quantum hamiltonian, as noted
by schwinger in 1962 [10]. the ordering problem was later re-examined by
christ and lee who demonstrated that the quantum hamiltonian diered
from the classical hamiltonian by special coulomb interaction terms, la-
belled (v1 + v2) [11]. a few years later, cheng and tsai [12] pointed out
that the (v1 + v2) -terms are equivalent to a distinct class of integrals, called
energy integrals, which lead to two dierent types of divergences [12, 13]:
(a) ordinary uv divergences associated with the structure of space-time, and
(b) divergences characteristic of the coulomb gauge, arising from the inte-
gration over the energy variable q0 in integrals of the form



z

dq0

q2

q2
0  ~q 2 + i

.

it is the divergences from such energy integrals that give rise to ambiguities
in the coulomb gauge. these ambiguities come as no surprise, since the
coulomb-gauge condition

~  ~a(x) = 0

(1)

does not x the gauge completely, but leaves a residual gauge freedom for
gauge transformations g(t) that do not depend on the space coordinates ~x.
in 1987, doust and taylor [14, 15] came to the conclusion that standard di-
mensional regularization is incapable of regulating both types of divergences

simultaneously1.

renormalization in the coulomb gauge has recently been examined by baulieu
and zwanziger [4], who treated the coulomb gauge as the singular limit of the
landau-coulomb interpolating gauge. zwanziger also exploited the coulomb
gauge in the study of connement [5]. employing a diagrammatic represen-
tation, he showed that the problematic energy integrals cancel, at least to
one-loop order. based on this observation, he assigned to these integrals the
value zero. however, it is not obvious that this cancellation procedure can
also be carried out explicitly beyond one-loop order [13].

accordingly, it seems desirable to regulate the coulomb-gauge integrals on
an individual basis. to this eect, a novel technique called split dimensional
regularization was introduced by one of the authors [16]. the idea is to
replace the measure dnq by

d2(+)q = d2q0 d2~q ,

(2)

where  and  are understood as parameters in the complex plane satisfying
 +  = n/2, and the limits   1/2 and   3/2 are taken only at the
end of integration. one may think of split dimensional regularization as a
special form of dimensional regularization, the special feature being that the
dimension of the energy component is explicitly specied to be non-integer.
whereas in [5] the ambiguous energy integrals were dened to be zero, in the
context of split dimensional regularization these integrals turn out to be zero
in a natural way.

to date, split dimensional regularization has been tested at one loop for the
gluon self-energy [16], and the quark self-energy and quark-gluon three-point
function [17]. all coulomb-gauge integrals appearing in these calculations
are free of ambiguities and respect the appropriate ward identities.
we note in passing that split dimensional regularization has also been applied
in the context of non-relativistic qcd [3].

however, as already alluded to in ref. [17], the real challenge comes from
energy integrals at two loops and beyond [15]. in order to investigate the
associated ambiguities, we have evaluated the contributions of the leading
1/2 poles of the complete two-loop quark self-energy. working in the frame-
work of split dimensional regularization, we nd that all integrals can be

calculated consistently.
but, whereas the coecients of the leading poles can be evaluated explicitly,
the coecients of the subleading poles are generally more dicult to com-
pute, since many of the parameter integrals can no longer be expressed in
closed form. for this reason, the subleading poles have not been evaluated
in their entirety in this paper.

it is also worth noting at this stage that the subleading poles exhibit the
following interesting feature: the regulators  and , characterizing the time
and space components, respectively, appear independently in the various -
functions, a clear indication of the special role played by the time component
in the coulomb gauge. (see section 2.3 for more details.) by comparison, in
the -functions for the leading poles, the regulators  and  always appear
in the combination  +  = n/2.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we rst discuss a specic
integral for which standard dimensional regularization fails to regulate the
divergence from the energy component, if the latter component is assumed
to be one-dimensional, and then show how split dimensional regularization
cures the ambiguity. in the second part of section 2, we concentrate on two-
loop integrals, analyzing in particular the properties of the subleading poles.
then we comment on some general properties of split dimensional regulariza-
tion. we demonstrate that the limit   1/2 after integration is always well
dened and discuss the implications of split dimensional regularization for
the subleading terms in the -expansion of noncovariant integrals. in section
3, we outline the calculation of the leading divergence of the two-loop quark
self-energy and present our results. the highlights of this paper are summa-
rized in section 4. appendix a contains results for the pole parts of one-loop
integrals (for both integer and non-integer powers of propagators), while ap-
pendix b shows the results for the leading poles of several two-loop integrals.
in appendix c and d we give general formulas for coulomb integrals at one
and two loops in feynman parameter space.

is seen to contain the factor 1/~q 2. while most coulomb-gauge integrals can
be computed consistently with standard dimensional regularization, it is no
secret that the appearance of the noncovariant factor 1/~q 2 in the integrand
may, under certain circumstances, lead to spurious singularities that require
special attention. the presence of two or more of these factors2, in combina-
tion with powers of q0 in the numerator, is particularly troublesome and can
lead to the ambiguous energy integrals mentioned in section 1. to illustrate
this point, consider the integral

i = z dnq

we shall rst show that standard dimensional regularization fails to regulate
the singularity in the energy component of i (i.e.
in i00), if the energy
component q0 of a vector q is assumed to be one-dimensional. after feynman

the example above demonstrates that the application of standard dimen-
sional regularization in the noncovariant coulomb gauge leads to unavoid-
able diculties, as long as the energy component q0 is assumed to be one-
dimensional. this conclusion raises another question, namely, how is the
dimensionality of q0 dened in standard dimensional regularization? the
answer to this question is that in general, the dimension of q0 need not to be
specied. in covariant integrals, we could distribute arbitrary fractions of 
to the individual components of a lorentz vector, as, for example, in

z dnq  z d0q0 d1q1 d2q2 dn012q3 .

due to covariance, the result will invariably depend only on n. however,
in noncovariant gauges, the situation is quite dierent.
in our example,
we could as well have assumed that the identity matrix contained in a is
three-dimensional, thereby leading to an energy component which is (n  3)-
dimensional, so that

in that case, the x-integral in i00 is given by r 1

2 +, which is well de-
ned by invoking analytic continuation in the context of dimensional reg-
ularization. this is exactly the idea of split dimensional regularization. it
asserts that in the noncovariant coulomb gauge, the energy component q0 of a
lorentz vector (as a loop momentum) cannot be treated as one-dimensional.
instead, a nonzero fraction of the regulator  in n = 4  2 has to be
assigned to the energy component, for instance by dening

such that  +  = n/2. the parameter c is arbitrary3, as long as we do
not set it to zero before all parameter integrals have been carried out. after
integration, we can dene the integral at  = 1/2 by analytic continuation,
invoking the same arguments as in standard dimensional regularization.
thus, the technique of split dimensional regularization imposes the condition
that the energy component q0 must be of non-integer dimension.
using split dimensional regularization, we nd for the integral i:

note that

in the context of split dimensional regularization, by the same arguments as

r dnq = 0 in standard dimensional regularization. the breaking of covariance

is manifest in eq. (12) from the function beta(1 , 1), which contains
, rather than  + , in the energy component of i. it is evident from this
example that split dimensional regularization leads to well-dened parameter
integrals.

2.2 subleading poles

in order to extract interesting quantities such as the two-loop renormaliza-
tion constant for the quark self-energy in the coulomb gauge, it is of course
necessary to determine not only the leading (1/2) poles, but also the sub-
leading (1/) poles of the two-loop integrals. since the expressions for some
of the coulomb integrals occurring in the two-loop quark self-energy are quite
involved (as already noted above), the subleading poles of these integrals can
no longer be extracted in the form of analytic functions. instead, they have to
be expressed as combinations of innite series and hypergeometric functions.
we shall illustrate the extraction of the subleading poles by means of two
examples. the rst example consists of an integral i1 where all integrations
can be done in closed form:

i1 =

(13)

g(, , ) =

(1  )2(  1)(1  )(1  2)

(1   + )(  )(  2)

,

where  +  = 2   has been used in eq. (13). but note that  and  also
occur separately in g(, , ), not only in the combination  + . in order to
extract the leading and subleading poles in , we use eq. (10) and expand4

4a factor 2(1 + ) has been extracted in order to avoid the euler e in the expanded

result.

i1 = (~p 2)2 2(1 + )(cid:26) 2
2 +

[5  c  2 log (2)] + nite(cid:27) .

(14)

we will comment on the appearance of the parameter c, in the sublead-
ing pole term, in section 2.3. note that the breaking of covariance is also
manifest in the factor (~p 2)2.

as a second example, consider the integral

again, we see that the breaking of lorentz covariance manifests itself in
terms such as ~p 2/p2
0 and in the fact that c appears in the subleading pole
term.
it should be clear from the result for the subleading poles of i2 in eq. (16)
that a complete determination of the subleading poles in the two-loop quark
self-energy is beyond the scope of this paper. afterall, i2 is still a relatively
simple coulomb integral since it has only one noncovariant denominator.

2.3 comment on noncovariance in the context of di-

mensional regularization

in the context of split dimensional regularization, as already explained in
section 2.1, the dimension d(q0) of the energy component of an n-dimensional
vector q is given by d(q0) = 2, where (cf. eq. (10))

 =

2

(1  )

,

  c   ,

(17)

and  serves to regulate the spurious divergences in the energy component,
inherent in the coulomb gauge. the important point is that the limit  
0 in the energy integrals after integration always exists. this means that
the singularities in the energy integrals, which would be unregulated for
 = 0, are really spurious. they do not show up as poles in . only
the usual uv and ir poles of coulomb-gauge integrals appear as poles in
 = 2  ( + ), whereas the potential singularities in the energy component
never show up as (k (1/2  )), but rather as (1  k  ), where k is a
positive integer. hence, the limit   0 with  xed, i.e. the limit c  0,
indeed exists. this observation follows from the expressions in feynman
parameter space for general coulomb-gauge integrals given in appendix c
and d. first, consider a scalar one-loop integral with r (r > 0) covariant and
m noncovariant denominators in n = 2( + ) dimensions (cf. eq. (41)):

concerning the appearance of the parameters  and , we see that the overall
-function (which indicates the uv behaviour), as well as the term in square
brackets containing the momentum dependence, always depend on the sum
 +  = n/2. only the integration over the feynman parameters xj (which
are associated with the covariant denominators) leads to the isolated param-
eter , the reason being that the feynman parameters yl never multiply a q0
component.
referring to eqs. (37)  (39) in appendix c, we observe that the most dan-
gerous case for a potential singularity at  = 1/2 occurs when r = 1, l  2,
and with factors of qb
0 in the numerator, that is, in the following type of
integral (for simplicity, we assume l = 1 for all l, since more general powers
l do not spoil the argument):

(19)

carrying out the derivative with respect to a4, we see that the resulting
x-integral will be of the form

dx x1 f (x, yl) , where

z 1

(b  1)/2

,

(20)

such that  is always an integer. the function f (x, yl) corresponds to the
term in square brackets in eq. (19) and will, after integration over z, always
contain the sum  +  in the exponent. since f (x, yl) in general does not
contribute to the leading behaviour for x  0, it is irrelevant for our consid-
erations5.
note that values of  > 1 actually improve the behaviour for x  0 in

5in the special cases where f (x, yl) does contribute to the leading behaviour for x  0
(for example, if l = 1, r = 1, p = 0), it also provides a regulator  for the exponent of x
and thus is harmless.

10

eq. (20). by contrast, it is the more severe ultraviolet behaviour, induced by
powers of qb
0 (b > 0) in the numerator, that can render the integral over x
singular unless the parameter  is complex6.
generalization of the above arguments to r > 1 is straightforward. if r is
the number of covariant propagators, b the power of q0 in the numerator
and l  2, then integration over one of the feynman parameters xi requires
a complex value of , provided r  b/2  0 is fullled (or, respectively,

pr

j=1 j  b/2  0 for general propagator powers).

summarizing, we conclude from the analysis above that all parameter inte-
grals are well dened if  contains the regulator , as in  = (1  c )/2, and
that the limit c  0 after integration is non-singular, since the exponents
 and  in eq. (20) are never half-integers.

at two loops, the situation is similar, as may be seen from the expressions in
appendix d. if c1 is the number of covariant denominators containing q, but
not k, and c2 is the number of covariant denominators containing k, but not
q, and if, furthermore, b1 and b2 are the powers of q0 and k0 in the numerator,
respectively, and ib is dened as in eq. (48), then a non-integer dimension of
the energy components q0, k0 is mandatory in the following cases (i  {1, 2}):

ci  bi/2 + ib  0
ci  bi/2  0

for c1 and c2 6= 0 ,
for ib = 1 and c1 or c2 = 0 .

(21)

as an example, consider the case ib = 0, 1 = 1, 1 = 1, i = 0 for i > 1,
j = 0 for j > 1, and all l, u = 1 in eqs.(42)  (49).
(more general
propagator powers do not change the arguments.) in that case, we have

m4 =   x1 0

x2 ! ;

0

(detm4)

1

2 = (x1 x2) .

analogous to the one-loop case, additional powers of q0 or k0 in the numerator
lead to more negative powers of x1 or x2, as can be seen from eqs. (47). for
example, two powers of q0 or k0 in the numerator lead to terms such as

(detm4)

i

although higher powers of q0 or k0 in the numerator will lead to even more
negative powers of xi, such as x1
, the parameter  can never be half-
integer. as a result, the parameter integral is well dened for complex values
of , and the limit   1/2 after integration exists due to the analytic
properties of the -function.
these arguments and the conclusion that  will never be half-integer, can
be generalized to l loops by using the same formalism as in appendix d,
with the objects l4, n4, . . . and ~l, ~n , . . . being dened in l  2 and l  2
dimensional space, respectively. hence, it follows that a troublesome -
function of the form (k (1/2  )) never arises.

the arbitrariness in the choice of c is not problematic, since it is just the
noncovariant version of the arbitrariness in the denition of the subtraction
scheme in the context of renormalization. to illustrate this point, consider a
simple one-loop integral t (p) in split dimensional regularization:

t (p) = z

(23)

using n = 4  2 cn , together with eq. (17), and expanding in , we arrive
at

c

(24)

the factor of 1/cn in the pole part is irrelevant since it will be removed
by renormalization. as the terms ln(4) and e, in the subleading part of
the -expansion, are always present as an artifact of standard dimensional
regularization, the additional term c/cn is just another aspect of the arbi-
trariness inherent in renormalization, caused by the breaking of covariance.
the freedom in the denition of the nite part merely reects the fact that
renormalization schemes need to be specied. the procedure of dealing with
the parameter c during renormalization (i.e., whether or not it is subtracted
together with the terms ln(4)  e) denes a specic noncovariant renor-
malization scheme in the context of split dimensional regularization.

12

of course, the easiest option would be to set c to zero after having evalu-
ated the integral, since, as explained above, the operation of setting c = 0
after integration is well dened, and is the natural choice as it corresponds
to d(q0) = 1 and d(~q) = n  1 in standard dimensional regularization. nev-
ertheless, it may be advantageous to keep the parameter c as a useful check
when computing gauge invariant quantities, since c obviously has to cancel
out in any physical quantity.

3 leading divergence of the two-loop quark

self-energy

there are two methods of determining the overall divergence of the two-loop
quark self-energy, namely by

1. direct calculation of the two-loop integrals corresponding to the graphs

shown in fig. 1;

2. computing the counterterm diagrams shown in fig. 2 by rst extracting
the uv-divergent parts of the corresponding one-loop subgraphs, and
then calculating the divergence of the overall diagram containing these
one-loop insertions.

we have used both of these methods in order to check the consistency of our
results. note that method (1) requires us to keep the full -dependence from
the rst integration if the momentum integrations are performed sequentially
(this procedure is sometimes called the nested method [19]). since it may
not always be possible to maintain, without expansion, the full -dependence,
the majority of our two-loop integrals has been computed by integrating
over both loop momenta simultaneously (also referred to as the matrix
method [19]), as outlined in appendix d.
it is worth emphasizing that the (spurious) infrared divergences are more
severe in the coulomb gauge than they are, for example, in the feynman
gauge, the severity being caused by the noncovariant factor 1/~q 2 in the gluon
propagator. a partial list of the noncovariant integrals used in our calculation
is given in the tables in appendix a and b. the number of integrals per
graph obtained by method (1) is typically of the order of a few hundred. the
algebra has been performed by using the symbolic manipulation program
form [20].

we would like to point out that (d) and (e) contain the double noncovariant
denominator 1/(~k2
12(k1). in diagram
(e), those double noncovariant denominators are reduced to single ones by
corresponding terms in the numerator, whereas no such cancellation occurs
in diagram (d). the integrals for graph (d) containing a factor 1/(~k2
1)2 are
those given in table 3 for  = 2.

after inserting the appropriate integrals and performing various crosschecks,
as outlined above, we obtain the following results for the leading poles:

note that the ward identity (26) manifests itself in the equation

we also recall that the one-loop gluon self-energy, g,ab
in the coulomb gauge, since it satises the ward identity [16]

 (q), is not transverse

qg,ab

 (q) + (q2 g  qq)h ab = 0 ,

(34)

18

where h ab is a non-vanishing ghost term. it should come as no surprise,
therefore, that the nal expression for (d) in eqs. (32) still contains the
vector n.
finally, we should like to draw the readers attention to the complete ab-
sence of nonlocal factors in any of the leading-pole expressions, eqs. (32).
the absence of terms such as p2
0/~p 2, ~p 2/p2, etc., which implies the cancella-
tion of all spurious infrared divergences, is certainly remarkable in view of
the ubiquitous appearance of nonlocal terms at intermediate stages of the
calculation. of course, the trend was already set at the one-loop level, where
the divergent parts of both the gluon self-energy and the quark self-energy
were shown to be local [16, 17].

4 conclusion

in this paper we have tested the technique of split dimensional regularization
by calculating the leading divergence of the two-loop quark self-energy (p)
in the coulomb gauge. we nd that the application of split dimensional
regularization enables us to compute all two-loop integrals consistently, and
that the nal expressions for the leading poles of each graph are local, despite
the presence of nonlocal terms at intermediate steps of the calculation.
the leading pole parts of noncovariant integrals at one and two loops, used
in the present calculation, can be found in tables 1  5 (appendix a, b). we
have also derived general expressions, in feynman parameter space, for both
one- and two-loop coulomb-gauge integrals (appendix c, d).
the latter expressions are useful in analyzing some general properties of the
technique of split dimensional regularization. first of all, these expressions
allow us to identify the class of integrals for which a complex regulator of
the form  = (1  c)/2 is mandatory in order that these integrals be at
all well dened. furthermore, it turned out that the leading pole of a typi-
cal coulomb-gauge integral, evaluated with split dimensional regularization,
depends only on the sum of the regulating parameters, i.e. on  +  = n/2,
whereas the subleading pole generally contains the parameter c. the lat-
ter stems from the isolated appearance of the regulator  and is a direct
consequence of breaking covariance. finally, we have demonstrated that the
limit c  0 after integration always leads to non-singular expressions, thus
establishing the consistency of split dimensional regularization in general.

or 1/(~p 2)a, where a > 0). the symbol  means that the corresponding
integral does not occur in our calculation and hence has not been computed.

by dierentiating the integral (44) repeatedly with respect to n4 and/or n ,
we may easily derive the appropriate expression for any tensor integral.
denoting the integrals with non-trivial numerators by jl[l(i)
4 ], jl[~l(i)], jl[l(i)
etc., where l(1)
get:

4 l(j)
4 = k4,~l(1) = ~q,~l(2) = ~k, and applying result (45), we

4 = q4, l(2)

4 jl[1] = 2z jl[l(i)

4 (cid:17)(i)

jl[1] .

the procedure for other integrals is similar, leading to expressions such as

jl[l(i)

4 ] = (cid:16)n4m1
jl[~l(i)] = (cid:16)n m1(cid:17)(i)

to cope with integrals in which either the factor (q  k)2, or (~q  ~k)2, is
absent in the basic integral (42), we proceed by rst introducing the indicator
functions

ib = n 1

0

and

if (q  k)2 is present
if (q  k)2 is not present

, ic = n 1

0

if (~q  ~k)2 is present
if (~q  ~k)2 is not present
(48)

ind(ib) = n (x0)

1

for ib = 0
for ib = 1

,

ind(ic) = n (y0)

1

for ic = 0
for ic = 1

,

such that x0 is set to zero if (q  k)2 is absent, and y0 is set to zero if (~q ~k)2
is absent. after integration over z, the most general formula for the scalar
(basic) integral (43) is then given by

j+ib

((r, m, a, b) + ib + ic  2  2)

although the expressions given above look somewhat complicated, since they
are intended to represent all types of integrals that may occur in a two-loop
calculation, they can be easily implemented into an algebraic manipulation
program in order to yield the parameter representations of the various inte-
grals.
