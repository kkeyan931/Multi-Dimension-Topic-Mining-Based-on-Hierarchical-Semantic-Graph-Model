abstract

we discuss gauge theories on d3 branes embedded in special non-
tachyonic orientifolds of the 0b string theory. in general, they corre-
spond to non-supersymmetric su (n ) gauge theories with scalars in
the adjoint representation and spinors in the (anti-)symmetric repre-
sentation. we study these theories via the ads/cft correspondence
and present evidence of their relation to n = 4 sym in the planar
limit. we also discuss nite n properties, focusing in particular on
the renormalization group ow. up to two loops, the logarithmic run-
ning of the gauge coupling is described by the dilaton tadpole and the
cosmological constant that naturally emerge on the string theory side.

1 introduction

the study of the strong coupling regime of gauge theories is one the most
dicult problems in high energy physics.
in recent years there was much
progress in this direction - mostly in the study of supersymmetric theories.
part of this knowledge was gained with the help of string theory.

lately, it was conjectured that the natural description of strongly cou-
pled large n n = 4 sym theory is in terms of classical supergravity. this
is known as the ads/cft correspondence [1] (for a recent review and refer-
ences see [2]). although this conjecture is very powerful, its original version
is restricted to theories with maximal supersymmetry. it seems very di-
cult to study non-supersymmetric and non-conformal gauge theories in this
framework, since it is not known how to construct their dual gravity back-
grounds.

the rst step in the direction of studying non-supersymmetric conformal
theories using the ads/cft duality was made in [3], where it was shown
that one can break supersymmetry completely, still within a large n cft.
the idea was to study the type iib string on ads5  x5, where x5 is a
ve-dimensional space of the type s5/. this construction yields conformal
theories with a reduced number of supersymmetries or no supersymmetry
at all. the conformal invariance of the resulting large n theories was then
proved both by string theory [4, 5] and by direct eld theory techniques [6].
a similar idea motivated the study of type 0b string theory[7], a (1)fs
orbifold of type iib. the orbifold breaks supersymmetry and the resulting
string theory, purely bosonic, contains the ns-ns sector of the iib theory
and doubled sets of r-r elds. in addition, it contains a tachyon from the
twisted sector, while the ns-r and r-ns fermionic sectors are projected out.
more recently this theory was also related to an orbifold of m-theory[8].

the theory that lives on the untwisted (dyonic) d3 branes is an su(n)
su(n) gauge theory with 6 adjoint scalars for each of the gauge groups and
4 ( , ) + 4 ( , ) weyl spinors. recently, the construction of [8] was used
to study this gauge theory [11], that is conformal at large n [9, 10]. other
type 0 conformal models were studied in [12, 13, 14].

although this gauge theory seems to be perfectly sensible, one might sus-
pect that, since the dual string theory contains a tachyon, some instabilities
should appear on the gauge theory side, and indeed, using the ads/cft
correspondence, it was shown that at strong coupling the dimension of the

1

1  tr f 2

twisted operator t  tr f 2
2 becomes complex [15]. the presence of
the tachyon makes the study of the dual gravity dicult, since the detailed
structure of its coupling to the r-r elds is not known. another (somewhat)
disturbing feature is the doubling of the gauge factors in all models that live
on dyonic d-branes [13]. this is due to the doubling of r-r elds, and is
seemingly unrelated to the tachyon issue.

is there any way to project out the tachyon from the type 0 spectrum, so

that one has a stable dual gauge theory?

and

the construction of tachyon-free models was rst discussed in [16], where
sign ambiguities in the klein bottle amplitude [17] were used to generalize
the standard  projection. the non-tachyonic projection required a u(32)
gauge group on the d9-brane, together with chiral fermions in the
representations. an exhaustive analysis of tachyon-free orbifold compacti-
cations was initiated in [18]. in general, for the (would be) supersymmetric
orbifolds new tachyons appear in the twisted sector of the closed string theory
and, for a geometric action of the orbifold group, can not be projected out
by any (generalized)  projection. the t 4/z2 and t 6/z3 cases, however, are
exceptional, since no tachyons appear in the twisted sectors and thus one can
nd appropriate  projections that lead to non-tachyonic open descendants.
the analysis was then extended to zn  zm orbifolds [19] and to the non-
supersymmetric t 6/z2 one [20]. a geometric interpretation of the signs in
the klein bottle amplitude, corresponding to the generalized  projections,
has been given in [21]: the non-tachyonic projection involves the combined
action of the world-sheet parity with the right world-sheet fermion number,
(1)fr.
in the simplest version of the construction, the orientifold of 0b leads to
a string theory that is very similar to the bosonic part of type iib [16]. from
now on, we shall refer to it as the type 0 string theory. the theory on the
d3 branes close to o3 planes of this sort was rst studied in [14]. it is an
su(n) gauge theory with the eld content in table 1.

table 1: the eld content of the non-supersymmetric gauge theory on n d3
branes close to o3 planes of 0b string theory.

most of the present paper is devoted to the study of this gauge theory
and its gravity dual. we will show that the theory is conformal at large n,
using both string theory and eld theory arguments. since the bulk theory
does not contain any tachyon, the gauge theory should be stable. moreover,
its study via gravity will be rather simple, and we will nd an ads5  s5
solution of the tree level gravity action.
we are also interested in nite n non-supersymmetric theories. in par-
ticular, we consider d3 branes of non-tachyonic orientifolds of type 0b string
theory, i.e. d3 branes in a background of o7 planes and 32 d7 branes (to-
gether with their images). at nite n, the theory is no longer conformal. on
the string theory side, the breakdown of conformal invariance is due to a dila-
ton tadpole and to a cosmological constant that appear once gst is turned on.
we use these stringy corrections to exhibit a qualitative logarithmic running
of the coupling constant, up to two loops on the eld theory side. the dilaton
tadpole aects the one loop beta function, while the cosmological constant
aects the two loop beta function. we also comment on the relation of the
dilaton equation of motion to the all orders beta function equation.

the organization of the paper is as follows. in section 2 we describe the
orientifold projections allowed in 0b models. in particular, we focus on the
projections that remove the tachyon from the 0b string spectrum, and con-
struct the gauge theory on two dierent systems: o3-d3 in type 0b and
d3 branes on type 0 backgrounds. we also discuss more involved models
originating from d3 branes at orbifold singularities, that lead to other non-
supersymmetric eld theories on non-tachyonic string backgrounds. sections
3 and 4 are devoted to the study of the gauge theories introduced in section 2
via the ads/cft correspondence. we also study the eld theory renormal-
ization group ow via gravity (see [22, 23, 24, 25] for a recent discussion and

3

[26] for another example of rg ow). in section 5 we give an independent
argument for the conformal invariance of the large n theory, based on the
work of [27]. in section 6 we study the relation between n = 4 sym and
the theory on the d3 branes. we suggest that these theories become equiv-
alent in the planar limit. in section 7 we discuss briey other eld theories
constructed in section 2.

2 type 0 orientifolds

in this section we construct some brane congurations that will be further
analyzed in the following sections. in particular, we construct gauge theories
corresponding to d3 branes embedded in non-tachyonic 0b orientifolds and
o3-d3 systems in 0b theories, where the orientifold planes involve the non-
tachyonic projection of [16]. to this end, let us recall some known facts about
the type 0b string and its orientifolds. the torus partition function

from t one can easily extract the low-lying excitations, that comprise a
tachyon, the graviton, the dilaton and the kalb-ramond eld from the ns-
ns sectors, and two scalars, two 2-forms and one 4-form from the r-r sectors.
the doubling of the r-r sector with respect to type iib implies that the 0b
string has two types of dp-branes for odd p.

to this left-right symmetric theory one can associate orientifolds [28, 29],
that in general contain two dierent types of orientifold planes and d-branes,
since the r-r sector is now doubled. a generic feature of the standard 0b
orientifolds is the presence of the tachyon in the unoriented closed sector.
actually, using the properties of the underlying two-dimensional conformal

4

eld theory [17], it was shown in [16] that the 0b string admits three inequiv-
alent orientifold projections. these are related to additional (world-sheet and
space-time) symmetries, and, in particular, the combination (1)fr, with
 the world-sheet parity and fr the world-sheet fermion number, removes
the tachyon from the closed unoriented spectrum [16], thus stabilizing the
vacuum. moreover, the (1)fr projection keeps only one copy of the r-r
sector, thus allowing for the presence of only one type of dp-branes for any
odd p (as in the iib theory). an exhaustive analysis of orbifold compacti-
cations has shown that one can remove the closed tachyon only in the t 4/z2
and t 6/z3 [18], in the t 6/z2 z2 [19] and in the non-supersymmetric t 6/z2
[20] orbifolds.

2.1 the o3-d3 system

let us describe the simplest model on d3 branes at non-tachyonic ori-
entifold planes. the o3 planes project the d3 brane gauge eld by  =
(1)fri6, where i6 inverts the six (non-compact) coordinates transverse to
the d3-brane.
on a at minkowski background, the annulus and mobius amplitudes

compatible with the type 0b string are

(2)

where the -function and the so(8) characters depend on the modulus of
the doubly-covering torus (it/2 for the annulus and (1 + it)/2 for the mobius
strip). one can simply extract the massless elds that live on the o3-d3
system: for n branes they are gauge bosons and six scalars in the adjoint of a
u(n) gauge group, as well as four weyl spinors in the + representations.
actually, since the space transverse to the d3 branes is non-compact, the r-
r tadpole need not be imposed, and one has the freedom to revert the sign in
the mobius amplitude thus obtaining spinors in symmetric representations.
the  projection acts also on the bulk theory. in fact, as we will see
in the next section, in the spirit of the ads/cft correspondence, gauge
invariant operators on d3 branes are related to harmonics of the bulk elds

5

on ads5  x5, with x5 some appropriate einstein manifold respecting the
in our case x5 = s5/z2 = rp 5,
symmetry of the brane conguration.
where the freely-acting z2 corresponds to the  projection, and thus only
the harmonics of the projected (bulk) elds survive [30, 2].

aside from the massless excitations, one can extract other interesting
informations from the amplitudes (1) and (2). for instance, since the fun-
damental (n) and anti-fundamental ( n ) representations of unitary groups
have identical dimensions, one can easily show that the annulus amplitude
vanishes, as

a  n 2 (v8  s8)  n 2 (cid:16)4

2(cid:17)  0 .

(3)

this translates into a vanishing force between pairs of d3 branes, as a result
of a perfect cancellation between the gravitational (ns-ns) attraction and
the r-r repulsion.

since gauge/string theory is non-supersymmetric, one would expect the
presence of a dilaton tadpole and/or of a cosmological constant on the string
theory side. unfortunately, it is hard to perform explicit string theory compu-
tations in curved backgrounds and therefore, in the following we will present
explicit models where these corrections are under control and a precise com-
parison between string theory and gauge theory can be worked out even at
nite n.

2.2 d3 branes in type 0 backgrounds

the conguration that now we are going to construct corresponds to d3
branes in non-tachyonic orientifolds of the type 0b string.
in particular
the background is an eight-dimensional toroidal compactication of the 
projected type 0b. before discussing the gauge theory arising on the d3
branes, let us introduce the background string theory and discuss its main
features.

the starting point is the halved toroidal partition function of the 0b

string on a two-dimensional narain lattice with momenta

leads to the following massless spectrum: the eight-dimensional metric ten-

the mixed components of the ns-ns b-eld, and full ten-dimensional 0-form,
2-form and self-dual 4-form r-r potentials.

the open sector that completes the orientifold construction [28] is encoded

the gauge theory on each set of d7 branes has a u(8) gauge group with 2
scalars in the adjoint and two spinors in the

actually, for  orientifolds one is always left with a non-vanishing dilaton
tadpole coming from the (v8 character in the) annulus amplitude, as can be

(7)

this has to be contrasted with the supersymmetric case, where the dilaton
couples both to d-branes and o-planes and its tadpole vanishes as a result
of r-r tadpole conditions. moreover, the torus, klein bottle and mobius
amplitudes are non-vanishing, and this translates into the emergence of a one-
loop cosmological constant. thus, dilaton tadpole and cosmological constant
induce for the dilaton eld a potential of the form

v () = ce + 2 ,

(8)

whose properties will be further analyzed in section 4.

we are now ready to add n d3 branes in the background of this type 0
string. the reduced so(8)  so(4)  so(4) transverse lorentz symmetry
translates into a breaking of the so(8) characters into products of so(4)
ones:

o8 = o4o4 + v4v4 ,
v8 = v4o4 + o4v4 ,

s8 = s4s4 + c4c4 ,
c8 = s4c4 + c4s4 .

(9)
(10)

putting all the d3 branes close to the orientifold plane at the origin (a1 =
(0, 0)) results in the following (massless) deformation of the annulus and
mobius amplitudes:

a  (m1 m1 + n n )(v4o4 + o4v4)

the eld theory on the d3 branes is thus an su(n) gauge theory with the
charged matter in table 2. (we are neglecting the u(1) factor associated
with the center of mass of the brane conguration.)

2.3 d3 branes at orbifold singularities

we can now turn to more complicated models, like o3-d3 systems on orb-
ifold singularities. the analysis of [18] suggests to restrict oneself to the
c 2/z2 and c 3/z3 singularities, since the other cases would introduce addi-
tional (twisted) tachyons in the bulk theory. for supersymmetric strings, z2
and z3 singularities would correspond to n = 2 and n = 1 gauge theories
[3], and in our case one nds an su(n)  su(n) gauge group for o3-d3
systems on a c 2/z2 singularity. the charged matter comprises four scalars
in the ( , ) and ( , ) and weyl spinors in the ( , ), ( , ), ( + , 1) and
(1, + ) representations.

the c 3/z3 singularities lead to a chiral spectrum containing an su(n 
4) su(n)  su(n) gauge group, as well as weyl spinors in the ( + , 1),
(1,
, ) representations. moreover, there are three copies of weyl
, ), (1,
spinors in the ( ,
, 1) and (1, 1, ) representations and
three copies of complex scalars in the ( ,
, )
representations.

, 1), ( , 1, ), (1,

, 1), ( , 1, ), (1,

, ) and (1,

all these models have the same main features of the o3-d3 system in at
minkowski space-time: there is no brane-brane interaction, and one expects
that a (half-loop) dilaton tadpole and a (one-loop) cosmological constant be

9

generated.

3 the low energy action and the ads/cft

correspondence

the orientifold projection introduced in the previous section leads to a non-
supersymmetric string theory with a rather simple low energy action. the
action of  = (1)fr on the oscillators of the underlying cft is [21]

 
 
 


n  = 
n
r  = 
r
r  =

|0in sn s =  |0in sn s

(13)
(14)
(15)
(16)

therefore, whereas type 0b string theory contains a tachyon and two sets
of r-r elds, the orientifold projection removes the tachyon and one set of
r-r elds from the bulk.
it picks the r-r two-form from the (r+, r+)
sector and the zero-form and four-form from the (r, r) sector. thus the
resulting ten-dimensional 0 theory is similar to the bosonic part of type iib

(17)
note that the tachyon is projected out and hence we expect the dual
theory on the d3 branes to be more stable than for other type 0 models. we
will make this statement more precise in the following. note also that the
ns-ns 2-form b is projected out. a nal remark concerning the action
(17) is that, in contrast to the unprojected type 0 action, we have only one
set of r-r elds. the doubling of the r-r elds in the type 0b action leads
to a semi-simple su(n)  su(n) gauge theory on the dyonic d3 branes.
here we expect that the dual theory on the brane have only one gauge factor.
indeed, the large n theory has a simple su(n) gauge group.

in order to study the type 0 theory in the presence of d3 branes we rst
perform 2 t-dualities along the 8, 9 directions and than place n d3 branes.
the resulting background consists of o7 and 8 d7 branes and localized n
d3 branes. (here we are interested in the degrees of freedom living close to

10

the orientifold plane at the origin.) the near horizon background, ads5 s3
(where the s3 sits inside the s5) respects the su(2) avor symmetry of the
model (see table 2). at innite n the 8 d7 branes can be neglected and the
avor symmetry is enhanced to su(4). accordingly, in this limit one nds
the standard ads5  s5 background metric
ds2 = d 2 + e2 dx2

(18)

i + d2
5

(with a radius r = 1). the ads5 part of the metric corresponds to an
so(2, 4) symmetry and suggests that the large n non-supersymmetric dual
theory is conformal. the s5 part corresponds, in the present case, to an
su(4) global avor symmetry.

the situation for the o3-d3 system is apparently quite dierent. in this
case the bulk theory is the full 0b string and (in the large n limit where the
charge of the orientifold 3-plane can be neglected and the conguration is
indeed extremal) the near horizon geometry is ads5 rp 5. however, the z2
identication in rp 5 keeps only the invariant harmonics of the bulk elds,
and the resulting spectrum coincides with the () projected bulk theory.
further evidence for the conformal invariance of these models will be given
in sections 5 and 6.

the ads/cft correspondence can be used to study the stability of these
non-supersymmetric models[15]. in the type 0 (unprojected) theory, the bulk
theory contains a tachyon. the squared-mass of the tachyon is shifted to a
positive value at small radius of the ads metric [9]. however, at large values
of the radius, when the bulk theory is at, we really have a tachyon. it is
related, by holography, to the twisted operator

t  tr f 2

1  tr f 2
2 ,

(19)

and therefore it was argued [15] that at large t hooft coupling  (large
ads radius) the dimension of tr f 2
2 will become complex, () =

2 + q4  22. this indicates an instability in the gauge theory at strong

1  tr f 2

coupling.

the present bulk theory contains no tachyon. therefore, the correspond-
ing gauge theory should be stable even at strong coupling. this conclusion
is not surprising since, as we shall see in section 6, this theory is related to
n = 4 sym.

11

4 cosmological renormalization group ow

in the previous section we started a study of the gauge theory using the bulk
theory. the discussion was restricted to large n, where the gauge theory is
expected to be conformal.

here we would like to study 1

n corrections to the gauge coupling of the
theory on the d3 branes in the type 0 background (the eld content is
described in table 2). our model is the non-supersymmetric analogue of the
one studied in[31, 32]. at nite n the coupling is expected to run, and indeed
the value of the one-loop beta-function coecient is

b1 = 8.

(20)

in calculating (20) we took into account the contribution of the 8 avors
of fermions and scalars (arising from the open strings that connect the d3-d7
branes). note that the value (20) is 1
n suppressed with respect to the general
expected behavior of beta function coecients and that the theory is ir free.
the higher order beta function coecients are also expected to behave as

bn  n n1 ,

as bets with the conformal invariance of the model at large n.

(23)

in order to study these 1

n corrections on the gauge theory side, we should
go beyond the tree-level classical gravity on the string theory side. before
entering into details, we would like to mention that several attempts to study
the running of the coupling were already made in various type 0 models [33].
thus, the coupling of the tachyon to the dilaton was used to extract the
logarithmic running of the gauge coupling in several non conformal models,
but it was dicult to nd precise results, since the detailed structure of

12

the tachyon coupling to the dilaton is not known. moreover, these results
depend on the minimum of the tachyon potential (the function that describes
the dilaton-tachyon couplings), and it is not clear whether such a minimum
really exists.

in the present case, the spectrum does not contain a tachyon, and there-
fore the mechanism that we present seems more controlled. an important
remark is that at nite n the background will no longer be an ads5  s3,
due to the back-reaction of the dilaton on the metric. however, we shall
see that the leading 1
n correction is determined by the tree level ads5  s3
background.
when gst is turned on, the classical action (17) acquires corrections, and
we nd two important contributions: a cosmological constant due to the loss
of supersymmetry and a dilaton tadpole arising from the annulus diagram
(see section 2). generally, the cosmological constant is expected to be pro-
st  1

with a nice qualitative agreement between gravity (34) and eld theory cal-
culations (23) up to two loops. the dilaton tadpole determines the one-loop
beta function, while the cosmological constant determines the two-loop beta
function. remarkably, in our model both the dilaton tadpole (7) and b1 (20)
are proportional to the number of d7 branes. this result is encouraging,
since it links the ads/cft correspondence to more realistic models where
conformal invariance and supersymmetry no longer exist.

it might look surprising that we nd an agreement between gravity and
perturbative yang-mills. after all, we do not expect that dual descriptions

14

in terms of gluons and gravitons apply at the same time. the reason for
the qualitative agreement is the following: as we shall see in section 6, the
non-supersymmetric models (table 1 and table 2) converge at innite n to
n = 4 sym. it is believed that in this case, the background is unaected by
 corrections. in the present case, we add a perturbation of 1
n . our hope is
that for large enough n and xed energy u, our results are unchanged.

finally, note that the dilaton equation of motion reproduces qualitatively,
at least to leading order in 1
n , all orders of the running coupling equation.
generally, in the presence of an orientifold, the string theory eective action
should receive corrections of any power of gst (even and odd), and therefore
the dilaton equation (27), should read

5 string theory amplitudes and the planar

limit

in this section we want to use the results of [27] to give plausible arguments
about the niteness of the gauge theories previously introduced. for simplic-
ity we will focus on the o3-d3 system in the large n limit, although similar
arguments apply also to the other model.

15

in a theory with d-branes and orientifold planes string amplitudes involve
world-sheets with b boundaries, c crosscaps and h handles, and are weighted
by

(ngst)b gc

st g2h2

st = 2h2+b+c n c2h+2 .

(38)

in particular, for the large n behavior of m-point correlators of elds charged
under the gauge group there are two classes of diagrams that have to be
considered: diagrams without handles and crosscaps, and diagrams with
handles and/or crosscaps, that from (38) are subleading in the large n limit.
in the same way, non-planar diagrams with only boundaries are suppressed
with respect to planar ones.

for planar diagrams with b boundaries and m external lines, the bound-

ary conditions must satisfy (in the notation of [27])

1
a1 =

b

ys=2

s
as ,

(39)

where the s dene the action of a (generic) orbifold group on the chan-
paton matrices and s = 1 refers to the outer boundary, while s = 2, . . . , b
refer to the inner boundaries.

if the orbifold group is trivial, in the large n limit the m-point amplitude
behaves as in the n = 4 one without orientifold planes (with gauge group
u(n)). for non-trivial (space-time) orbifold groups, it has been shown in [27]
that diagrams with twisted chan-paton matrices are vanishing or suppressed
in the large n limit, thus leading to the conjecture that supersymmetric o3-
d3 systems on orbifold singularities have the same leading behavior as the
n = 4 u(n) gauge theory.
actually, the model that we are considering can be thought of as an
orbifold of the supersymmetric o3-d3 system, where the orbifold group cor-
responds to the internal (1)fs symmetry. this projection leads to two
dierent  matrices such that:

tr(1) = (n + n ) ,

tr(2) = i(n  n) .

(40)

it is then evident how to apply the previous arguments to the present case.
non-planar and unoriented amplitudes are suppressed in the large n limit,
and among the planar diagrams, the ones with 1 boundary conditions on
both external and internal boundaries give the same behavior of n = 4 u(n)

16

gauge theory. on the other hand, diagrams with at least one inner boundary
with a 2 insertion are vanishing since they are proportional to

x tr(1

a1 1 . . . m )

b

ys=2

tr(s
as )

and at least one of the inner s is

s
as = 2  tr(s

as ) = i(n  n) = 0 .

(41)

(42)

we thus conclude that in the large n limit our model indeed behaves like
the n = 4 supersymmetric u(n) gauge theory. similar arguments can also
be applied to o3-d3 systems of type 0b on orbifold singularities.

6 field-theory analysis - the relation to n =

4 sym

arguments in favor of conformal invariance can also be presented in a eld
theory context. our gauge theory corresponds to an su(n) gauge group with
6 scalars in the adjoint representation and 4 spinors in the
representation
and its conjugate. the string theory analysis of the previous sections proved
that this theory is conformal in the large n limit. in fact, as we shall see,
the large n limit of this theory is exactly n = 4 sym.
the similarity to n = 4 sym is rather clear. the only dierence between
the two theories is that the spinors transform in a dierent representation,
and therefore supersymmetry in broken explicitly in the type 0 case at nite
n. however, we will argue that at large n adjoint spinors and spinors in

+ give the same contribution to any amplitude.

our arguments are similar to those given in [6] for the case of orbifold
eld theories, where it was shown that the planar graphs of the n = 4 sym
and of the daughter theory, an orbifold truncation of n = 4 , are the same
up to a rescaling of the gauge coupling in the latter.
let us therefore examine the relation between the present non-supersym-
metric gauge theory and the n = 4 theory. since we are interested in the
planar limit, it will be convenient to use t hoofts double index notation,
where elds that transform in the adjoint representation carry two lines with

17

arrows in opposite directions. this is the case, since the adjoint represen-
tation is obtained by a multiplication of fundamental and anti-fundamental
representations. similarly, a eld transforming in the anti-symmetric rep-
resentation carries two lines with arrows in the same direction, since the
anti-symmetric representation is obtained by multiplication of two funda-
mentals. thus the fermion propagator in the non-supersymmetric theory
will be represented by two parallel lines with arrows pointing in the same di-
rection, while bosonic propagators are represented by two parallel lines with
arrows pointing in opposite directions.

the feynman rules of the non-supersymmetric theory and of the super-
symmetric theory are very similar. the only dierences are in the vertices
which couple fermions and bosons, such as the coupling of the gluon to the
fermions or the yukawa coupling. in these graphs, one of the arrows of the
fermion lines is reversed. the fermionic propagator and the fermion-boson
coupling are described in gure 1 below.

c

figure 1: feynman rules for n = 4 sym and for the non-supersymmetric
theory. a) fermion propagator and fermion-boson vertex. b) feynman rules
for the supersymmetric theory: both fermions and bosons are in the ad-
joint representation. c) in the non-supersymmetric orientifold theory bosons
transform in the adjoint representation whereas fermions transform in the
representation (and in the

rep.).

although we will not present a rigorous proof, we will argue that this
change of the feynman rules will not aect any calculation that only depend
on planar diagrams: every planar diagram in n = 4 sym can be deformed

18

so that it represents the non-supersymmetric theory and vice versa. as a
result, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the planar graphs of
both theories.

the rule is simple: one should follow the fermionic double lines and re-
verse the arrow of one of the lines, so that the two arrows along the fermionic
lines point in the same direction. it is easy to see that this rule is consis-
tent with the feynman rules, and in particular the interaction of bosons and
fermions is unaected by this deformation: the bosons will remain in the
adjoint representation.

let us give a simple example. consider the fermionic loop contribution
to the one-loop vacuum polarization in both theories (gure 2). it is clear
that the planar diagram of the supersymmetric theory can be deformed into
the planar diagram of the non-supersymmetric theory.

figure 2:
a) the fermionic loop contribution to the vacuum polarization.
b) a planar contribution in the supersymmetric theory. fermions are in the
adjoint representation. c) the arrows in the internal loop were reversed such
that the fermions are now in the

(and ) representations.

one might be tempted to believe that all diagrams (not only the planar
ones) of the two theories are equivalent. this, however, is not true. there
are non-planar diagrams that exists only in one of the theories. for instance,
the one loop beta function is b1 =  16
3 in the non-supersymmetric theory,
but b1 = 0 in the supersymmetric case.

the reason why the deformation works in the planar case is that pla-
nar graphs form a collection of non-intersecting lines. one should follow
the fermionic line and simply reverse one of the arrows, and this procedure
does not lead to inconsistencies. the fermionic lines can be closed loops,
or lines with an end (in the case of external legs). since lines do not inter-
sect and fermion number is conserved, the deformation can not change the
representations of the bosons, that remain in the adjoint.

19

the conclusion of this discussion is that in the innite n limit the non-
supersymmetric theory becomes supersymmetric, since there is no dierence
between the anti-symmetric representation and the adjoint representation at
large n.
in this regime the theory described by the orientifold of type 0
becomes the n = 4 sym.
since this theory becomes n = 4 sym in the planar limit, we arrive at
several interesting conclusions. in this limit, the theory has bps states, a
moduli space of vacua and possesses olive-montonen duality. these features
can be proved, in the innite n limit, by the relation to n = 4 , via feynman
diagrams or via the bulk string theory. the existence of a moduli space of
vacua can be seen both calculating the force between parallel d3 branes
using the cylinder diagram of the type 0 string theory, or calculating the
coleman-weinberg potential in the eld theory. both calculations yield a no
force result, and thus the scalar v.e.v. is indeed a modulus. the existence of
bps states in eld theory is due to the existence of such objects in iib string
theory, or can be seen by a eld theory calculation in the planar limit. finally,
the fact that the large n beta-function is zero is either due to s-duality of
the iib action or to s-duality in n = 4 sym.
a more interesting question is whether some of these features survive
at nite n. since the theory is not supersymmetric and even the bose-
fermi degeneracy is destroyed at nite n (we have 8(n 2  1) bosons and
8(n 2  n) fermions), we do not expect a supersymmetric behavior away
from the planar limit. clearly s-duality is broken, since the  function is no
longer zero. however, some of these features might be broken more softly
than naively expected.

one example is the existence of a moduli space. the cylinder diagram
yields a zero force between d3 branes, as a result of the balance between
the exchange of the ns-ns elds g and  and of the r-r four form. the
calculation of the coleman-weinberg one-loop eective potential yields the
same result. the bosonic contribution to the potential is [34, 35]

vbos(r) =

1
42 r2 log

r2
2 ,

(43)

where r is the v.e.v. of the scalar (the separation between the d-branes)
and  is some cuto. the fermionic contribution is vf er(r) = vbos(r), and
therefore the net force is zero, to this order. note that, in contrast with the
su(n)  su(n) gauge theory on the d3 branes of type 0b, where some

20

directions were unstable and the gauge group was dynamically broken to
its u(1)s [35], in the present case there is no 1
n potential at tree level. in
particular there is no instability and there seems to be a moduli space even
at nite n. however, as we stated above, higher order perturbation theory
will probably lift the vacuum energy at generic points in the moduli space.

7 non-conformal large n eld theories

the procedure described in the previous section is quite general. any su-
persymmetric theory with fermions in the adjoint or bi-fundamental repre-
sentations can be deformed into a non-supersymmetric theory by changing
the (color) representation of the fermions, in such a way that the large n
theory will converge to its parent supersymmetric theory. the rules are:
adjoint  + , ( , )  ( , ) and ( , )  ( , ). in particular, non-
conformal n = 2 and n = 1 theories can be used as parents.
without the background of a string theory, we will not be able to say
much about the non-supersymmetric daughter theory. in fact, generally we
expect a tachyonic instability at strong coupling[15], and for this reason we
restrict ourself to theories that live on d-branes with a non-tachyonic bulk
theory. two such theories were constructed in section 2 (other cases were
recently discussed within the type i [36, 37] and type iib [38] frameworks).
the orientifold projection of the type 0b theory on the z2 orbifold will con-
verge in the planar limit to the n = 2 su(n)  su(m) gauge theory with
hypermultiplets in the ( , ) and in the ( , ) representations. thus, up to
1
n corrections, n = 2 results apply to this model.
the second example is the z3 orbifold. it is interesting to take the limit
when two of the gauge couplings of the theory are set to zero and the rank
of these groups is equal. we also take only one copy of the matter multiplet.
in this limit, we will have an su(nc)  su(nf )  su(nf ) theory with the
non-supersymmetric eld content of table 3

in the large nc, nf limit (with the ratio nf

some sort of similar duality holds at nite n as well. note that, in contrast
to the type 0 unprojected theory[13], the one loop beta function receives a
