the purpose of this note is to discuss briey the brst cohomology of the
extended antield formalism, to give some details on exact couples and spectral
sequences, and to apply these concepts in the problem at hand.

1 introduction

1.1 classical theory

the batalin-vilkovisky formalism [19, 20] allows one to formulate the brst dif-
ferential [21, 22, 23, 24] controling the gauge symmetries under renormalization
for generic gauge theories. the formalism can be extended so as to include (non
linear) global symmetries (see [12, 13] and references therein), which is achieved
by coupling the brst cohomology classes in negative ghost numbers with con-
stant ghosts. a further extension including the brst cohomology classes in all
the ghost numbers can be constructed [16]. some features of this extension are :

 it allows one to take into account in a systematic way all higher order

cohomological constraints due to the antibracket maps [14],

1

 it is the appropriate formalism to prove stability independently of power
counting restrictions, also called renormalizability in the modern sense
[25], in the case of generic gauge theories,

 an appropriate brst dierential can be constructed on the classical and

the quantum level, even in the case of anomalous theories [17].

let us briey summarize the results of [16] needed in the following. the
extended formalism is obtained by rst computing a basis for the local brst
cohomology classes. this basis contains as a subset those classes that can be
obtained from the solution s of the master equation by dierentiation of s
with respect to so-called essential coupling constants. the additional classes
completing the basis are then coupled with the help of new independent cou-
pling constants. this action can then be extended by terms of higher orders
in the new couplings in such a way that, if we denote by a all the couplings
corresponding to the independent brst cohomology classes, the corresponding
action s satises the extended master equation

1
2

(s, s) + cs = 0.

(1.1)

the brst dierential associated to the solution of the extended master equa-
tion is

s = (s, ) + l
c ,

(1.2)



c = ()af a l

c (a, b) = (l

a f a, while l

c a, b) + ()a+1(a, l

where c = r
a , with f a depending (at least
quadratically) on the couplings  alone. both antiderivations satisfy (c)2 =
0 = (l
c )2. since there is no dependence on the elds and the antields,
l
c b), with the appropriate version hold-
ing for the right derivation c. the local brst cohomology classes contain the
generators of all the generalized non trivial symmetries of the theory in nega-
tive ghost number, the generalized observables in ghost number zero, and the
anomalies (and anomalies for anomalies) in positive ghost number. this is the
reason why the extended master equation encodes the invariance of the original
action under all the non trivial gauge and glocal symmetries, their commutator
algebra as well as the antibracket algebra of all the local brst cohomology
classes.

the cohomology of s in the space f of  dependent local functionals in the

elds, the antields and their derivatives is isomorphic to the cohomology of

sc = [c, ]

(1.3)

in the space g of graded right derivations  = r
alone, [, ] being the graded commutator for graded right derivations,

a a, with a a function of 



h(s, f )  h(sc, g).

(1.4)

if  is a sc cocycle, the corresponding s cocycle is given by s = rs

b b.

1.2 quantum theory

in the standard version of the brst-zinn-justin-batalin-vilkovisky set-up,
there are two main issues to be considered: stability and anomalies.

the problem of stability is the question if to every local brst cohomol-
ogy class in ghost number 0, there corresponds an independent coupling of the

2

action. the extended formalism solves this problem trivially by construction,
since all cohomology classes have been coupled with independent couplings. the
non trivial part of the formalism is the proof of the existence of the extended
master equation and the associated dierential, which allows to control the sym-
metries after the extension. of course, it will be often convenient in practice
not to couple all the local brst cohomology classes but only a subset needed
to guarantee that the theory is stable.

in the standard set-up, the question of anomalies is mostly reduced to the
question of the local brst cohomology in ghost number 1 and to a discussion of
the coecients of these cohomology classes. in the presence of anomalies, there
is no dierential on the quantum level associated to the anomalously broken
zinn-justin equation for the eective action. in the extended formalism how-
ever, because all the local brst cohomology classes in positive ghost numbers
have been coupled to the solution of the master equation, such a dierential
exists [16]. indeed, the quantum action principle [26, 27, 28] applied to (1.1)
gives

1
2

(, ) + c = ha  ,

(1.5)

where  is the renormalized generating functional for 1pi vertices associated to
the solution s of the extended master equation and the local functional a is an
element of f in ghost number 1. using the result (1.4) on the cohomology of
s, one can show [16, 17] that, through the addition of local counterterms, (1.5)
can be written as

1
2

(, ) +  = 0,

(1.6)

where  is associated to the action s = s k=1hkk containing local nite
brst breaking counterterms k and  = c + h1 + h22 + . . . satises
()2 = 0. the associated quantum brst dierential is

sq = (, ) + ()l.

(1.7)

in the limit h going to zero, we recover both the classical extended master
equation (1.1) and the classical dierential s.

in the extended antield formalism, the anomalous zinn-justin equation
can thus be written as a functional dierential equation for the renormalized
eective action. the derivations 1, 2, . . . are guaranteed to exist due to the
quantum action principles. they satisfy a priori cohomological restrictions due
to the fact that the dierential  is a formal deformation with deformation
parameter h of the dierential c.

for instance, the derivation 1 is a cocycle of sc in ghost number 1, because
[c, 1] = 0. this cocyle can be assumed to be non trivial, because otherwise,
1 could have been absorbed by the counterterm 1. hence, non trivial anoma-
lies, which correspond in this formalism to non trivial deformations of c, are
controled by h 1(sc, g).

in the standard way, once care has been taken of the trivial anomalies
through the counterterms k, the remaining innite and nite counterterms
are required to belong to h 0(s, f )  h 0(sc, g) in order to preserve (1.6) to
that order.

it is thus of interest to compute the cohomology of sc.

2 brst cohomology in the extended antield

formalism



let  = r
a a be a right derivation. we assume that the a are formal power
series in a. in the following, we provide this space with an obvious ltration. it
will however not have nite length, and for particular theories, better ltrations
have to be found in order to do a complete computation. since the techniques
will be similar, it is nevertheless useful to show how they work on this example.

2.1 grading and ltration on the space of right derivations

let n = r
a a be the operator counting the number of s. a general right
derivation admits the following decomposition according to the eigenvalues of
n:  = 1 + 0 + 1 + . . ., where [p, n] = pp. hence, g is a graded space,
g = p=1gp. (it is actually a bigraded space, the other grading, for which
sc is homogeneous of degree 1 being the ghost number.)

the graded right commutator satises [[m, n], n] = (m + n)[m, n].
the decomposition of c starts at eigenvalue 1: c = c1 + c2 + . . . ; the
corresponding decomposition of sc being sc = [c1, ] + [c1, ] = . . . 
s1 + s2 + . . .. it follows that the cocycle condition sc = 0 decomposes as

s11 = 0,
s10 + s21 = 0,
s11 + s20 + s31 = 0,
...,

while the coboundary condition  = sc decomposes as

1 = 0,
0 = s11,
1 = s10 + s21,
2 = s11 + s20 + s31,
...,

(2.1)

(2.2)

in order to construct the spectral sequence associated to this problem, we follow
[29].

consider the spaces kp of derivations having n degree greater than p, i.e.,
  kp if  = p + p+1 + . . .. the space of all right derivations is g = k1,
kp+1  kp and sckp  kp. the sequence of spaces kp is a decreasing
ltration of g, with kp/kp+1  gp.

we have the short exact sequence1:

0  p=1kp+1

i

 p=1kp

j

 p=1kp/kp+1  0,

(2.3)

where p=1kp/kp+1  p=1gp. the following diagram is exact at each
corner:

h(sc, p=1kp+1)

i0 h(sc, p=1kp)

k0   j0

e0,

(2.4)

where e0 = p=1kp/kp+1  p=1gp. in this diagram, h(sc, kp) is de-
ned by the cocycle condition sc(p + p+1 + . . .) = 0, and the cobound-
ary condition p + p+1 + . . . = sc(p + p+1 + .... the maps i0 and j0
1a diagram is said to be exact if the image of a map is equal to the kernel of the next map.

4

are induced by i and j, i0[p+1 + p+2 + . . .] = [p+1 + p+2 + . . .] and
j0[p + p+1 + . . .] = [j(p + p+1 + . . .)] = [p]. they are well dened, be-
cause i0 maps cocycles to cocycles and coboundaries to coboundaries, while
j(sc(p + p+1 . . .))  kp+1. the map k0 is dened by k0[p] = [scp]. it
does not depend on the choice of representative for [p]  kp/kp+1, because
[sc(p+1 + . . .)] = 0  h(sc, kp+1).

let us check explicitly that this diagram is exact:

 ker j0 is given by elements [p+p+1+...]  h(sc, kp) such that sc(p+
p+1 + ...) = 0 and p = 0. this is the same than i0h(s, kp+1), which is
given by [p+1+p+2+. . .], with sc(p+1 +p+2+...) = 0, the equivalence
relation being the equivalence relation in h(s, kp) by denition of i0.

 ker k0 is given by elements [p] such that [scp] = 0  h(sc, kp+1), i.e.
such that scp = sc(p+1 + p+2 + ....). by the identication p+1 =
p+1, p+2 = p+2, . . ., this is indeed the same than j0h(sc, kp)
given by [p] with sc(p + p+1 + . . .) = 0.

 ker i0 is given by elements [p+1 + p+2 + ...] such that sc(p+1 + p+2 +
...) = 0 and p+1 + p+2 + ... = sc(p + p+1 + ...), while k0[p] is given
by [p+1 + p+2 + ...] of the form [scp] so that p+1 + p+2 + ... =
scp + sc(p+1 + . . .), which is indeed the same.

2.2 exact couples and associated spectral sequence

to every exact couple (a0, b0), i.e., exact diagram of the form

i0 a0
a0
k0   j0

b0,

one can associated a derived exact couple

i1 a1
a1
k1   j1

b1.

(2.5)

(2.6)

in this diagram, the spaces and maps are dened as follows: a1 = i0a0; b1 =
h(d0, b0), where d0 = j0  k0 ( d2
0 = 0 because k0  j0 = 0); for a1 = i0a0,
i1a1 = i1(i0a0) = i2
0a0; j1a1 = [j0a0] (this map is well dened: j0a0 is a cocycle,
because k0  j0 = 0, furthermore the map does not depend on the representative
choosen for a0, because if i0a0 = 0, a0 = k0b0 for some b0 and j1a1 = [j0 k0b0] =
0); k1[b0] = k0b0 (k0b0 = i0a0 for some b0 because d0b0 = j0(k0b0) = 0 implies
k0b0 = i0a0, furthermore k0d0c0 = 0 because k0  j0 = 0).
let us also check explicitly exactness of this diagram:

 ker j1 is given by elements a1 = i0a0 such that [j0a0] = 0, i.e., j0a0 =
0c0. i1a1 is given
0c0. it follows that ker j1  i1a1, while the

j0k0b0 and then a0  k0b0 = i0c0, implying that a1 = i2
by elements a1 = i1c1 = i2
inverse inclusion follows from j0  i0 = 0.

 ker k1 is given by elements [b0] such that k0b0 = i0a0 = 0, i.e., such that
b0 = j0c0, for some c0, while im j1 is given by elements [b0] such that
[b0] = [j0e0], i.e b0 = j0(e0 + k0f0). it follows that ker k1 = im j1.

 ker i1 is given by elements a1 = i0a0 such that i0(i0a0) = 0, i.e., i0a0 =
k0b0 (which implies in particular d0b0 = 0).
im k1 is given by elements
a1 = i0a0 = k0b0 for some b0 with d0b0 = 0, so both spaces are indeed the
same.

5

clearly, this construction can be iterated by taking as the starting exact

couple the derived couple. we thus get a sequence of exact couples

ir ar
ar
kr   jr

br.

(2.7)

and the associate spectral sequence (br, dr), for r = 0, 1, . . ., i.e., spaces br and
dierentials dr satisfying br+1 = h(dr, br).

2.3 spectral sequence associated to the brst cohomol-

ogy of the extended antield formalism

let us now apply the general theory to the case of the exact couple (2.4) and
give explicitly the dierentials dr and the spaces br (called er) in this case for
r = 0, 1, 2, 3.

we have e0 = p=1kp/kp+1  p=1gp. the dierential d0 is dened by
d0[p]0 = j0[scp], where [scp]  h(sc, kp+1). it follows that d0[p]0 =
[s1p]. this means that ep
1 is dened by elements [[p]0]1 with the cocycle
condition

and the coboundary condition

s1p = 0

p = s1p1.

(2.8)

(2.9)

a f a

bc bc , and s2

because s1 = r
bc are the structure
constants of a graded lie algebra, this group is just a graded version of stan-
dard lie algebra (chevalley-eilenberg) cohomology with representation space
the adjoint representation.

1 = 0 implies that the f a

take now [[p]0]1  ep

1 . the dierential d1[[p]0]1 = j1k1[[p]0]1 =
j1k0[p]0 = j1[scp] = [j0i1
0 [scp]]1. this means that [scp] has to be
considered as an element of h(sc, kp+2) so that d1[[p]0]1 = [[s2p]0]1. hence
ep

2 is dened by elements [[[p]0]1]2 with the cocyle condition

s2p + s1p+1 = 0,
s1p = 0,

and the coboundary condition

p = s2p2 + s1p1,
0 = s1p2.

(2.10)
(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

we thus nd that ep

2 = h p(s2, h(s1)).

the dierential d2 in ep

2 is dened by d2[[[p]0]1]2 = j2k2[[[p]0]1]2 =
j2k1[[p]0]1 = j2k0[p]0 = [j1i1
1 k0[p]0]1]2. in order to
make sure that k0[p]0 belongs to i1i0h(sc, kp+1) we use p + p+1 as a rep-
resentative for [p]0. it follows that d2[[[p]0]1]2 = [[[s3p + s2p+1]0]1]2. the
cocycle condition for an element [[[[p]0]1]2]3  ep

1 k0[p]0]2 = [[j0i1

3 is then given by

0 i1

s3p + s2p+1 = s2p+1 + s1p+2,
s2p + s1p+1 = 0,
s1p = 0,

(2.14)

(2.15)
(2.16)

6

with s1p+2 = 0. the redenition p+1  p+1  p+1 and p+2 = p+2,
then gives as cocycle condition

s3p + s2p+1 + s1p+2 = 0,
s2p + s1p+1 = 0,
s1p = 0.

(2.17)

(2.18)
(2.19)

the coboundary condition is [[[p]0]1]2 = d3[[[p3 +p2]0]1]2, where s1p3 =
0, s2p3 + s2p2 = 0, hence [[p]0]1 = [[s3p3 + s2p2]0]1 + d2[[p2]0]1,
with s1p2 = 0 which gives

p = s3p3 + s2p2 + s2p2 + s1p1,
0 = s2p3 + s1p2,
0 = s1p3, 0 = s1p2.

(2.20)
(2.21)

(2.22)

the redenition p2  p2 + p2 and p1 = p1, then gives the cobound-
ary condition

p = s3p3 + s2p2 + s1p1,
0 = s2p3 + s1p2,
0 = s1p3.

(2.23)
(2.24)

(2.25)

this construction can be continued in the same way for higher rs.

the original problem was the computation of h(sc, g) = h(sc, k1).

from exactness of the couples (2.7), it follows that

h(sc, k1)  j0e1

 ker k0( e1

0  ker j0
0 )  i0h(sc, k0)
1 )  i1i0h(sc, k1)
...
)  ir . . . i0h(sc, kr).

 ker k0( e1

0 )  ker k1( e0

 r

r=0ker kr( er1

r

(2.26)

(2.27)
(2.28)

0  e1

1  f 1

furthermore, e0  e1  f0  d0f0 and e1
. f0 does not belong
to ker k0 because d0f0 6= 0. thus ker k0( e1
1 ). similarily,
e1  e2  f1  d1f1 and (d1f1)1 = (d1f1)0 = 0. again, d1[f1]1 6= 0 implies
that f1 does not belong to ker k1. this means that ker k1( e1
1 )  ker k2(
e1
2 ). going on in the same way, we conclude
that ker kr( er1
r )). we thus get

1 )  ker k2( e0
))  ker kr( er1

0 ))  ker k1( e1

2 ) and ker k1( e0

r

0

h(sc, k1)  r

r=0ker kr( er1

r )  ir . . . i0h(sc, kr).

(2.29)

this construction is most useful

suppose that kr = 0.

deed,
ir . . . i0h(sc, kp+r+1) = 0, it follows that

if it would stop at some point.
because kr[. . . [p]0 . . .]r belongs

in-
to

h(sc, k1)  r1

r=0 er1
r .
