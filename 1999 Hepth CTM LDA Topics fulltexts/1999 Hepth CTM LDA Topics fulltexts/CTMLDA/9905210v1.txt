abstract

we consider domain walls embedded in curved backgrounds as an approximation for
braneworld scenarios. we give a large class of new exact solutions, exausting the possibil-
ities for describing one and two walls for the cases where the curvature of both the bulk
and the wall is locally constant. in the case of two walls, we nd solutions where each wall
has positive tension. an interesting property of these solutions is that the curvature of
the walls can be much smaller than the tension, leading to a signicant cancellation of the
eective cosmological constant, which however is still much larger than the observational
limits. we further discuss some aspects of ination in models based on wall solutions.

1 introduction

there has been considerable interest recently in higher dimensional theories with internal
dimensions which are large compared to the fundamental planck length of the theory [1]-
[11]. if the fundamental theory is higher-dimensional, the higher-dimensional fundamental
planck scale may be many orders of magnitude smaller than the planck scale in a world of
only four dimensions (4d). the eective 4d planck mass is given by m 2
d+4
where r0 is the size of the compact dimensions [1]. if these dimensions are much larger than
the fundamental planck length,
>> 1, the reduced planck mass may be exponentially
larger than the fundamental planck mass. setting the fundamental planck mass to be
equal to the unication scale of the theory, one may then understand the mass hierarchy
as a consequence of stabilizing the internal space at a radius which is exponentially large
compared to the fundamental scale.

in most of the models considered to date, the 4d world is a domain wall, or 3-brane,
living in a higher-dimensional theory with compact internal dimensions. the metric was
independent of the internal coordinates. similar proposals have been made before [12, 13],
but recent developments in string and m-theory, which may explain why matter degrees
of freedom are stuck to the wall [6, 7] gave new credibility to such ideas.

it has been pointed recently, however, that a dierent realization of the higher-
dimensional resolution of mass hierarchy may be found if the metric depends on internal
coordinates [14]. specically, the hierarchy emerges because the scales change throughout
the internal dimensions, and the particle masses are literally a function of the location of
our 3-brane in the internal space. in a very interesting work, randall and sundrum [14]
have shown that even if there is only one extra dimension, and even if it remains very
small, it may still be possible to obtain large mass hierarchies if the extra dimension is
strongly curved. in their approach, this was provided by a large negative cosmological
constant in the extra dimensions, which makes the metric a very sensitive function of the
internal coordinates. still, this bulk vacuum energy is cancelled on the brane by the brane
cosmological constant, and so it would be cosmologically neutralized inside our world.

in this work we will explore the solutions where the bulk cosmological constant is not
exactly cancelled by the brane one. our motivation for this is twofold. first, we are inter-
ested in determining the circumstances under which it may be possible to have the brane
universes which may be rapidly expanding, and hence lead to successful inationary cos-
mology. existence of such scenarios is very important in models with low compactication
scale. in addition to the usual cosmological problems of the 4d universe, there one has
to explain the emptiness of large extra dimensions, which could contain far more energy
than the brane. since this would contradict the observations, such cosmological obstacles
need to be answered dynamically, and ination is the best candidate [1, 9, 11]. in the
models with sub-millimeter internal dimension this problem is ably handled by ination
before stabilization of extra dimensions [11]. second, it may be possible to nd com-

1

pactications which are dierent from the example given in [14], but where nevertheless
the mass hierarchy emerges because of the strongly curved internal dimensions. indeed,
we will present new solutions describing parallel branes. each brane will have a small
net cosmological constant. in some cases the net cosmological constant will be negative,
which may be less attractive, but this possibility is not ruled out experimentally. the
eective cosmological constant on each brane may be many orders of magnitude smaller
than the natural scale due to the cancellation between the bulk cosmological constant and
the brane tension. however, with the phenomenologically reasonable parameters needed
to generate hierarchy, we nd that the cancellation still falls short of producing an eec-
tive cosmological constant in the range of 10120m 4
p l. nevertheless, the mere fact that it
may be possible to get a small cosmological constant from large ones in this way deserves
notice. there may exist other solutions which are realized in a similar spirit, that yield
an even smaller nonzero cosmological constant on the wall.

throughout the article we will also discuss some issues of relevance for early cosmology
and ination on branes in curved backgrounds. rather interestingly, many inating branes
get surrounded by event horizons in the bulk during ination. as ination nears the
end, these horizons move slowly away from the brane.
if the inationary periods are
long, the dynamics of the bulk event horizon may help solve the bulk horizon problem
without signicant ne tuning, since perturbations inside of the horizons get stretched
and pushed far away (to the hidden wall?). hence, such solutions may lead to economical
higher-dimensional inationary scenarios.

the paper is organized as follows. we begin by deriving the solutions corresponding
to one and two branes in bulks with constant curvature. we then proceed to discuss
the properties of brane spacetimes, discussing the generalization of the usual friedmann
equation in cosmology and the role of the bulk event horizons. in section iii we consider
the features of the new solution with two parallel branes, noting that the eective cosmo-
logical constant on each brane could be much smaller than the natural scale, although still
too large to t the observations. finally, we close with the conclusion. the appendix
contains details of the derivation of solutions.

2 solutions

we begin by considering a 3d domain wall, or a 3-brane, in a curved 5d bulk, which
couples gravitationally to the 5d bulk theory. the action specifying the dynamics of the
brane-bulk system is

s = zm

d5xgn r

22

our conventions are r
common in low energy string and m-theory. further, we use 2

, where m is the

5d planck scale, roughly equal to the unication scale. the subscripts m and m in the
action stand for the 5d bulk and the 4d brane which from the standpoint of the bulk
may be viewed as its boundary. we note that g in the 5d bulk and 4d boundaries are
dierent, being related by g(boundary) = g(bulk)/g55. this aects the equations of
motion, ensuring that the projection of the branes contribution to the bulk stress-energy
tensor vanishes in the directions transverse to the brane.

to obtain the equations of motion, we can now vary the action (1) in the usual fashion.
however, for the purposes of our investigation we can simplify our considerations without
sacricing physical contents. we are interested in determining the brane geometry at
large distances when the bulk is curved, both during ination on the brane(s) and in
the limit when the expansion is very slow. thus it is sucient to consider solutions
where the energy density on the brane is nearly constant, and so approximate the brane
contribution to the stress-energy tensor by the brane tension. further, recalling the
properties of the scalar-tensor theories of gravity, which approximate the theory given
by (1) in the infrared limit, when the bulk curvature is changing rapidly, generically the
brane will neither inate nor settle down to a highly homogeneous and isotropic state.
hence, there should be epochs when we can model the sources of curvature in the bulk
by bulk cosmological terms. therefore, the eective action which we consider is

s = zm

(2)

where we have taken the negative cosmological term in the bulk. our motivation for this
sign choice is that such models can be naturally obtained by compactifying supergravity
theories in 10d by using the freund-rubin ansatz [15], for example, compactifying the
iib string theory on ads5  s 5 [16]. other examples of domain walls in supergravity
have been considered in [17, 18]. a possibility that the world may look like a domain
wall in the context of horava-witten theory [6] has been pursued in [19], and possibilities
for ination in this model were studied in [20]. we have in mind a particular application
of the solutions to the recent scenario proposed by randall and sundrum [14], and their
solutions indeed emerge as the future asymptotics of some of the solutions presented
below. however, all solutions will depend analytically on , allowing one to continue 
to the range of negative values, corresponding to a positive bulk cosmological constant.
the parameter  is the brane tension, which we will also allow to be both positive and
negative (with  > 0 corresponding to positive brane tension).

the equations of motion which follow from (2) are

(3)

where the stress-energy tensor is a combination of wall and bulk terms. to nd the specic
form of the equations of motion, we need to write down the metric ansatz which will reect
the symmetries on the 3-brane. here we can use some known solutions as a guideline. in
the limit  = 0,  > 0, the solution must correspond to the inating 3-brane in 5d, found

3

3m 3

5 |w|)2(dt2+exp(8t/3m 3

in [9]; it is given by ds2 = (1 4
5 )d~x2)+dw2, and corresponds
to a 3d domain wall undergoing ination, which is shrouded by a rindler horizon in the
bulk. in the limit  = 2
52/6, the solution corresponds to a at 3-brane in a 5d ads
background, found in [14], and given by ds2 = exp(2
5|w|/6)(dt2 + d~x2) + dw2. hence
we could look for a two-parameter family of solutions which interpolates between these
limits, which would be de-sitter on the wall and anti-de-sitter in the bulk. however,
rather then restricting only to those 4d space-time sections which are de-sitter, we will
merely require that they are maximally symmetric, thus representing any of the de sitter,
anti-de-sitter or minkowski spacetimes in four dimensions. the metric ansatz which
accomplishes this is

ds2

5 = a2(w)(dt2 + e2htd~x2) + b2(w)dw2

(4)

where the brane scale factor h will be completely determined by the cosmological terms
 and  after we normalize the coecient of dt2 to unity on the brane.
indeed, if h
is imaginary, h = ih, we can analytically continue the solution (4) by a coordinate
transformation t = ix, x = it, y = y and z = z to

ds2

5 = a2(w)(cid:16)dx2 + e2hx

(dt2 + dy2 + dz2)(cid:17) + b2(w)dw2

(5)

a metric with 4d anti-de-sitter slices as claimed. one must not ignore these solutions,
since it is well known [21] that their slices correspond to open frw universes, and hence
are not ruled out by observations. in fact, for all cases where the brane metric is locally
ads4, we will use the frw representation

ds2

5 = a2(w)(cid:16)dt2 + |h|2 cos2(|h|t)(

dr2

1 + r2 + r2d)(cid:17) + b2(w)dw2

(6)

since we will have in mind cosmological evolution, where the solution (6) could be a
reasonable approximation at times after ination on the brane.

to solve the equations of motion, we can substitute the ansatz (4) into (3), and work
out the details. alternatively, we can work in the action, dimensionally reducing the
theory to only one dimension, which is possible since the 4d slices in (4) are maximally
symmetric. the dependence of all geometric quantities on the coordinates of 4d slices is
completely prescribed by the symmetry. a straightforward calculation (see the appendix)
gives the equations of motion, which in the gauge b = 1 are

again, we underline that h 2 can be both positive and negative, despite the slightly
confusing notation. we will solve the equations for h 2 > 0, since the solutions for h 2 < 0

4

can be easily obtained by analytic continuation. leaving the details for the appendix,
when h 2 > 0 we can write the solution as

we see that at the location of the brane, a(0) =

(10)

this, nally, is our new solution for the case of a single brane. the warp factor is a
combination of exponentials while the wall is curved. we will discuss its properties in the
next section. here we should point out one generic feature of wall models with localized
energy density. rather interestingly, the square of the rate of expansion on the brane,
given by the friedmann equation in the usual 4d cosmology, is now

h 2 = 2

5

52  6

36

(11)

this equation is a further extension of the generalized friedmann equations of [22] be-
cause it incorporates bulk contributions in addition to the brane terms. when the bulk
cosmological constant is zero, the expansion rate is given by the brane tension (and not
its square). when the tension is zero, the expansion rate is equal to the square root of
the bulk cosmological constant, i.e.
just the usual friedmann rule. in the general case
when both terms are nonzero, the brane expansion rate is a hybrid of these two formulas.
as we have announced above, for suciently large  > 2
52/6 the expansion rate is
imaginary, which means that the brane geometry is ads4 rather than ds4. the imagi-
nary numbers are removed by a proper analytical continuation, discussed above. we will
return to more examples of single brane solutions in the next section.

let us turn to solutions describing two branes. we will only consider solutions where
the branes are perfectly parallel. such solutions can be described by the action we have

discussed above, which includes an additional contribution  r m d4xg. we will

approach the problem by taking the solution (10) describing one brane in ads5 as a
background, and will look for ways to t the other brane in it, adjusting its tension

5

as required. the backgrounds are warped products of the 4d spacetime and the fth
dimension, implying that such geometries can be foliated by a congruence of slices which
are conformal to the 3-branes. this allows us to nd solutions by a simple pasting of
the probe brane. here we will briey review the derivation, referring the reader to the
appendix.

in order to match the background solution with the long range elds of the probe
brane, and insure that the resulting array is a solution of the einsteins equations, we will
start with the generalized friedmann equation (11) for the source brane together with
the rst of eq. (7). if we combine these two equations, we nd

(12)

the rhs of this equation is not always positive denite, which will enable us to construct
new solutions of parallel branes, dierent from the cases considered in [14]. this equation
shows that both branes have the same intrinsic curvature, given by (11), although their
tensions are dierent. away from the branes the original solution (9) solves (12) and the
brane expansion rate is given by (11). this is just the gravitational eld of the source
brane. the second order dierential equation in this case contains an additional dirac
-function,

(13)
the eect of the branes is to compactify the bulk on the circle, w  w + wc, and further
orbifold the circle by z2 operation w  w in order to stabilize the solution. substituting
the solution (9) into (13), we obtain the matching condition

the existence of solutions of this equation depends on the signs of the brane tensions , 
, as discussed in the appendix. one can group those solutions into
and the ratios
two main categories.

6

,

the rst category of solutions is qualitatively new, since both branes have positive
tension. for such solutions, the bulk cosmological constant must be at least innitesimally
larger than the square of the larger of two tensions, which without loss of generality we
can take to be the source brane, with tension : 6 > 22. by (11), this means that
the branes can never be completely at unless they are innitely far apart. indeed, the
branes are separated by a distance wc given by

tanh(s 2

and we see that if 6 = 22, wc  . the warp factor on the probe brane is

a(wc) = vuut

(15)

(16)

the equation for the warp factor is easily obtained from substituting the jump of the warp
factor at the other brane a2/a2(wc) = 4
52/6 into eq. (12). clearly, the warp factor on
the brane with smaller tension is smaller. hence this brane should be the candidate for
our world, since the warping will lower the scales there. the amount of warping and the
brane separation are completely specied by the values of the cosmological terms, which
as we will see below is a generic property of the parallel brane congurations. hence this
obviously suggests an intricate relationship between the cosmological constant problem
and the mass hierarchy. we will return to this interesting relationship later. since both
branes feel a net negative curvature, they may be viewed as frw ads4 universes. the
metric of the complete solution can therefore be written as

where a(w) is given by (9) with additional identication in the bulk w  w + wc, w  w.
the solution for a(w) for w < 0 is therefore a mirror image of the solution for w > 0
around the vertical axis at w = 0, as it should be for orbifold constructions. note that
a(w) is cusping upwards at both branes, because both branes have positive tension. this
is possible because the solution (9) for a bounces in the bulk between the two branes,
as can be seen from the eq. (12). the rhs can vanish between the branes, and a can
reexpand again. this of course is induced by the negative curvature on the branes. we
will discuss phenomenological aspects of these solutions later.

the second category is comprised of the solutions where one of the branes has a
negative tension, whereas the other has a positive tension. the solutions however fall into

three very dierent subcategories. in the rst case, if  = 56 =  5 6 , the distance

between the branes wc is arbitrary, as well as the amount of warping at the brane with
negative tension (we remind the reader that we have normalized the warp factor to unity
at the source brane). this is the solution given in [14], describing two at branes. in the
other subfamily of solutions, if the absolute value of the negative tension is even slightly
larger than the positive tension, which is possible if the bulk cosmological constant is
slightly smaller than the square of the positive tension (which implies that both branes
are inating, as can be seen from (11)), the distance between the branes is not arbitrary
any more, but is completely specied by the cosmological terms:

obviously, wc could be arbitrary only in the simultaneous limit  = || =

. the warp

(19)

the warp factor at the brane with negative tension is smaller than unity, which is quali-
tatively the same as in the solution of [14]. unlike there, however, the amount of warping

a(wc) = vuut

2
52  6
2
5||2  6

7

is completely specied once the cosmological terms are given. the explicit form of the
solutions is locally the same as (4), with the warp factor given by (9) and with identi-
cations w  w + wc, w  w. the warp factor cusps upwards on the positive tension
brane, and downwards on the negative tension brane. the third subfamily of solutions
has the positive tension of one brane larger than the absolute value of the negative tension
of the other brane. the bulk cosmological constant must be larger than the square of
the positive tension. again, even if the dierences between the cosmological terms are in-
nitesimal, the distance between the branes is completely specied once the cosmological
terms are known:

(20)

tanh(s 2

wc) =

56(  ||)
6  2
5||

both branes feel a net negative curvature, however, and hence the metric of the solution
is formally the same as (17), with dierent values of the cosmological terms. the warp
factor a again cusps upwards on the positive tension brane and downwards on the negative
tension brane. however, the warp factor at the negative tension brane is profoundly
dierent from the previous two cases: it is much larger there than on the brane with the
positive tension. its value is also uniquely specied by the cosmological terms:

a(wc) = vuut

6  2
6  2

52
5||2

(21)

this can be understood as follows: this warp factor is in fact a negative of the actual
solution of the einsteins equations. since the physics on either brane does not know
about the sign of a, we could simply ignore it, and instead write just the absolute value
of a. then the ow of the warp factor is opposite to the previous example, and hence the
magnitude of a is naturally greater at the brane with negative tension.

6
5

the latter two subfamilies of solutions suggest that the construction of [14] satisfying
the condition  = || =
may be unstable to small perturbations of the brane tensions.
even a small mismatch between the brane tensions and the bulk cosmological constant
could oset the necessary amount of warping, a(wc)  1015, regardless of where the
perturbation takes the solution. however, once solutions belong to either of the two
subfamilies with mismatch already present, their stability under small perturbations is
restored. we will consider some explicit examples later.

there also exist solutions of two parallel branes when  < 0 (positive cosmological
constant). this can be seen from (14) and the fact that the hyperbolic functions should
be replaced by trigonometric ones. these solutions can be useful as toy models for in-
ationary model building. here we will list the solutions with their principal properties,
as we did for the case when  > 0. we leave the details for the appendix, and a brief
discussion of phenomenology of such solutions for the sec. iii.

all the solutions with  < 0 represent two parallel inating branes separated by some
bulk distance in the orbifold construction. using (11), we see that the expansion rate

with the orbifold conditions w  w + wc and w  w. the solutions are now divided into
three categories. there are two rather special cases, and the rst is dened by  = .
it corresponds to two branes with tensions of the opposite sign. both of these branes are
inating, as should be expected from (11) and  < 0. the interbrane distance is still
xed, and is given by

wc = s 6

5||



(23)

having normalized the warp factor to unity on the positive tension brane (source brane),
we nd that at the negative tension brane it is just a(wc) = 1. hence in this particular
case, the mass scales on both branes coincide. the second special case has both tensions
positive. however, the bulk cosmological constant is given by the product of the tensions,
6|| = 2

despite the fact that both branes have positive tension, there is still a horizon between
them. the reason is that the brane with larger tension is more repulsive than the one with
smaller tension, and that the bulk cosmological constant is positive. the last category of
solutions is the most generic, and includes all those congurations for which  +  6= 0
and 6|| 6= 2

where  = sgn{cos(q 2

the branes, depending on the interplay of the three terms ,  and ||. the distance
between the branes is however controlled by the scale of the bulk cosmological constant,
l  q 6
, since the inverse tangent function is always bounded by unity. hence in a de
sitter background the scale of the interbrane distance is only weakly aected by the bulk
geometry, unlike in the ads background. we will discuss these solutions further in sec.
iii.

3 isolated domain walls

we now examine the solutions (10) in more detail. let us begin with  > 0 (which
corresponds to negative bulk cosmological constant) and  > 0 (positive brane tension). in
the limit   0 we recover precisely the inating 3-brane solution of [9], which generalizes
52, we get the

another notable property of the solutions with 0    2

is the existence and
location of the bulk event horizon. as can be seen from (10), the 3-brane is surrounded
with a rindler-type event horizon in the bulk, which is located at the hypersurface w =
const where the metric coecient g00 vanishes. a simple calculation shows that this is at

rindler horizon in the bulk could be helpful because of the cosmic no-hair theorem [24],
which has two aspects in this context. first, it pushes any bulk perturbations which occur
near the brane away from it. second, it prevents perturbations at distances larger than
the rindler horizon from ever aecting the brane. from the vantage point of the brane
those perturbations behave as if they have fallen inside of a black hole. as a result, any
perturbations at distances shorter than the rindler horizon are pushed outside of it, while
the perturbations at longer distances are harmless to begin with. on the other hand, as

2

526

the brane expansion rate h = 5
decreases (which can be accomplished either
by increasing the bulk cosmological constant  or by decreasing the brane tension ),
the rindler horizon moves farther and farther from the brane. hence if the bulk was
4 , it may become homogeneous over ever larger
distances as h approaches zero. to see when this may happen, we should note that the
time it takes for perturbations near the brane to get near the event horizon is roughly

initially homogeneous over distances  3m 3

given by   wh. hence to fully benet from the presence of the rindler horizon in the
bulk during ination on the wall, the expansion rate should decrease slowly, at timescales
at least of order of wh or larger. otherwise the horizon would move away from the brane
faster than the perturbations, trapping them forever near the brane. therefore we nd a
fundamental criterion for the slow roll condition for ination on the brane, which should
be satised to simultaneously resolve both the brane and the bulk homogeneity problem
without ne tuning: the expansion rate on the brane should change at timescales at least
as large as wh. this is eectively similar to having asymmetric ination of [11].

as long as the poincare symmetry on the 3-brane is unbroken, the range of parameters
52/6 cannot be reached by the rolling of the cosmological terms. this is
for which  > 2
52/6, the expansion rate on the brane is imaginary, and so the intrinsic
because for  > 2
geometry of the brane is ads4, as can be seen from (11). we have seen that our new
solution with two branes (17) is precisely of this form. indeed, this should be expected
since if the brane tension  vanishes, the brane must bend to conform to the bulk ads5
geometry, becoming just an ads4 slice of it. the brane tension  resists this, and the
favored ground state of the system depends on the rigidity of the brane relative to the
extrinsic curvature imposed by the bulk. we will not study the mechanisms which can
break the poincare symmetry on the brane, but will merely assume that solutions with a
denitive sign of h 2 are at least locally minima of the hamiltonian, and are perturbatively
separated from the solutions with the opposite sign of h 2. however, it would be interesting
to investigate this in more detail. we note that the hyperbolic functions in g00 of (10)
remain unchanged. the location of the rindler horizon (29) gets pushed beyond innity,
in a manner of speaking, because g00 never vanishes for any value of w.

what happens if  < 0? as we have already discussed in the previous section for the
case of two parallel branes, this corresponds to the positive bulk cosmological constant, in
our conventions, leading to an even more vigorous ination on 3-branes than when  > 0.
indeed, this remains true for a single brane case too. the solution is formally the same as
(22), except that the only identication is w  w, and otherwise w is unbounded. the
expansion rate along the brane is now increased by the bulk contributions, as expected.
the metric however has become periodic in the bulk, including the periodic distribution
, where the fundamental

now we consider the solutions for the brane with a negative tension,  = ||. when
 > 0, the solutions are still given by (10). rather peculiarly, the intrinsic geometry on
the brane is still inating, even though the tension is negative, as can be seen clearly

11

from the generalized friedmann equation (11). however, the dierence appears in the
absence of the rindler horizon in the bulk. the coecient g00 does not vanish at any
hypersurface w = const. in contrast to the case  > 0,  > 2
52/6, the brane is now
attractive for the probes in the bulk, rather than repulsive. this means that any object
which may be present in the bulk will fall onto the brane in a nite amount of time. such
a rain of particles from extra dimensions further underscores the instability of the solution
and may impose strong phenomenological constraints on model building. it would be of
interest to investigate it in more detail.

the negative tension branes appear generically even more unstable if we take  < 0.
the solution is given by (22), but without the periodic identication w  w + wc. the
brane is still attractive for the particles in the bulk. however, now it is surrounded by
a repulsive rindler horizon, which limits the causal inuence of the brane on the bulk
physics. hence the phenomena on the brane could exert inuence in the bulk up to
horizon distances, but not beyond. this means that outside of the horizon, there may
be, for example, a highly inhomogeneous distribution of particles which will all however
fall on the brane in some nite time, and possibly destroy any homogeneity produced
by ination. clearly, such a situation would be devastating. however, as we know, in
this case the distance of the horizon oscillates, and can be arbitrarily large. one may
therefore imagine some physics on the brane reaching out into the bulk to homogenize
it during such phases. determining the possibility or impossibility of such phenomena
would obviously require scrutiny beyond the scope of the present investigation, and we
will not address it further.

4 parallel walls

we now return to the solutions which describe two parallel branes. our main interest is to
explore the new family where both branes have positive tension (17), but each have frw
ads4 geometry. the branes must be negatively curved because the eective cosmological
constant felt on each brane is not completely cancelled. this is acceptable in principle
if the curvature is small, even if negative. the ads4 is crucial for the existence of this
solution, since it enables the warp factor (9) to bounce between the branes, which can
be seen from eq. (12). however, we will also reect on the solutions where one wall has
positive tension and another negative. in particular, the example where the branes have
a small net positive curvature is quite interesting, since both branes are simultaneously
undergoing ination.

the bulk geometry in the direction orthogonal to the brane is more complex than in
the example of the two brane solution of [14]. the deviation of the warp factor given by
(9) takes into account the bending of the branes in the bulk. still, we can follow closely
the proposal of [14], which posits that a physical particle living on either brane couples to
only the 4d conformal metric on each brane, while the warp factor only renormalizes the

12

physical scales of the theory. however, an additional constraint must be considered. since
in general there is an excess cosmological constant on each brane, we must ensure that
the numbers needed to produce the mp l mew hierarchy do not give an excessively large
leftover cosmological constant on the brane. as we have suggested before, this means
that there is a very intricate relationship between the cosmological constant problem
and the hierarchy problem. one must therefore use these extended criteria to check the
phenomenological feasibility of the constructions based on parallel branes.
in general,
we will see that this is not satised in the simple examples, since the numbers needed to
produce mass hierarchy fall short of cancelling the cosmological constant to experimentally
permitted values. nevertheless, for a certain range of admissible parameters which do
lead to the correct mass hierarchy, there is a very signicant reduction of the eective
cosmological constant on the branes. in a sense the picture which emerges is a hybrid of the
ideas of [1] and [14]. to reduce the net cosmological constant on the brane, the unication
scale should be lower than the planck scale and the bulk should be large. so a part of the
hierarchy is generated by raising the 4d planck scale as in [1]. the warping then produces
additional contribution to the mass hierarchy, lowering the fundamental scale down to
mew . therefore although this mechanism does not yet solve the cosmological problem, it
is still quite interesting. it gives a possibility to have a very small but nonzero cosmological
constant on the brane. there may exist other solutions describing two branes, with some
additional scalars in the bulk (such as the moduli elds in string theory) which could
produce a more complicated running of the warp in the bulk, yielding a more ecient
cancellation of the cosmological constant on our wall. such scenarios may be useful for
understanding why the cosmological constant may be very small but nonvanishing.

since the scale of the particle dynamics varies non-monotonically in the bulk, the
hierarchy would have to come from the ratio of the warp factors at dierent branes.
having normalized one of them to unity, we can simply use the value of the other as given
in eq. (16). then we recall the relationship between the fundamental scale, given by m
and the planck scale mp l. since 2

our wall should be the one with smaller warp factor, therefore it is parameterized by

these equations show that in addition to the mass hierarchy there also arises an interesting
hierarchy of the cosmological constants: the residual cosmological constant  is smaller
from the tension of our wall , which in turn is smaller from the tension of the other wall
. the cosmological terms increase by factors of mew
. all the while, the distance between
m
the branes may be much larger than the unication length m1
. in fact, even this fact is a
conrmation of the induced hierarchy of cosmological constants: the separation between
branes is a bulk phenomenon, controlled by the bulk scale 1/4, while the phenomena
on the brane are controlled by 1/4. hence the situation indeed represents an interesting
combination of elements of [1] and [14]. however, one can verify that there is a lower bound
on ,   1032(t ev )4, which is saturated when m  t ev . this is too large by about
30 orders of magnitude. also, in this case     , and the smallness of  becomes
just the usual ne tuning. the distance between the branes would then be wc  1015cm.
nevertheless, generically  may still be considerably smaller than the natural scale set
by the brane tension on the hidden wall. this reduction of the cosmological constant is



14

purely geometrical. since the brane dwells in the curved bulk, when it is located in the
region of smaller bulk curvature, it will bend less. the amount of bending measures the
eective cosmological constant on the wall, and is determined by the location of the brane,
which is controlled by the interactions of the brane with the bulk and the hidden brane.
hence the bulk geometry needed to produce the hierarchy of particle physics scales could
be useful to reduce the severity of the ne tuning of cosmological constant.

the warp factor for the solutions with one positive tension brane and one negative
tension brane is very similar to the case when both branes have positive tension. thus it
is clear that as long as the warp factor is very small on the brane with negative tension
and 2

corresponding to a positive cosmological constant  = m 4

can be satised in principle. but from (38), taking the natural scale of the tension not
to exceed m as well, we get m 2
 . since m  1t ev , the distance between the
branes will reduce the net cosmological constant by at most 32 orders of magnitude, when
m is exactly a t ev . hence again the net cosmological constant on the wall is bounded
from below by   1032(t ev )4, unless the bulk cosmological constant is ne-tuned to
an extremely low value. however, the formula for the warp factor (28) shows that in such
a case further ne tuning of the wall tensions would be required to produce the mass
hierarchy.

p l  wcm 3

however, we again stress that it is important to note that although the parallel brane
solutions discussed here only partially succeed in simultaneously resolving the mass hier-
archy problem and reducing the cosmological constant ne tuning problem, the decrease
in the net cosmological term can be nonnegligible. this suggests interesting possibilities.
it may happen that there exist parallel brane solutions similar to (17) but with a dierent
behavior of the bulk energy density, and dierent brane tensions, which could give more
ecient screening of the cosmological constant on our wall. for example, such solutions
could be realized in presence of additional bulk scalars, which can further modify the
running of the cosmological terms in the bulk, or it may happen that the cancella-
tion can be augmented in the presence of more large internal dimensions. we must note
here however that the cosmological constant problem in a universe comprising of a single
brane need not be as closely related to the mass hierarchy, since if a brane is alone in
the universe, the cosmological constant on it can be tuned to an arbitrary value. thus
the cosmological constant problem acquires its more conventional guise in the lone brane
models.

5 conclusions

it is widely believed that the unied theories of interactions which contain quantum
gravity should have more than four space-time dimensions. contrasting the conventional
approach to additional dimensions which are curled up at extremely short distances, the
recent proposal for explaining the hierarchy problem envisions a more active role of the
extra dimensions. the suggestion that there may be large sub-millimeter dimensions
[1] has opened up a new alley of model-building, with many interesting applications in
particle physics. the understanding of cosmology in such models is still at an early stage.
there are several proposals for the description of the early universe which may give a
picture that can conform with the standard big bang cosmology at low temperatures
[1, 11]. however, it is also possible that the extra dimensions may play other roles,
complementing the proposal of [1] as discussed in [14].

here we have taken the view that the extra dimensions could play a role which com-

16

bines the proposals of [1] and [14]. this view was illustrated by deriving new large families
of solutions of einsteins equations that describe single 3-branes and pairs of 3-branes,
which are located in a curved 5d world, and may themselves also be curved. since the
intrinsic curvature of the walls amounts to a net cosmological constant as viewed by an
observer pinned to the wall, it is important to check that the numerical values of parame-
ters in models with hierarchy do not give an excessively large cosmological constant. for
solutions which represent individual 3-branes, the net cosmological constant can always
be tuned down to an arbitrarily small value. thus, while these solutions are safe, they do
not tell anything about the cosmological constant problem.

for the solutions of two parallel 3-branes, the situation is more interesting. the
hierarchy in these solutions emerges because two walls are located at dierent places
in the curved bulk. hence the variation of the metric in the bulk from one wall to
another may renormalize the microphysical scales. as a result, the walls will generically
have to bend in order to t in the bulk geometry. the amount of bending of each wall
depends on its location, and the cosmological constant on the wall is proportional to its
net curvature. therefore, there will be a natural hierarchy of cosmological constants in
the solutions. we have seen that the net cosmological constant on our wall may become
many orders of magnitude smaller than its naturally expected magnitude. however in the
simple solutions we have considered, this geometric softening of the cosmological constant
is not suciently strong to bring it down to 10120m 4
p l. nevertheless, the solutions show
a tendency to produce a net cosmological constant on our wall which can be much lower
than expected, while still keeping the true wall tension large. perhaps there exist dierent
solutions representing curved walls where the screening of the cosmological constant on
our wall is more ecient.

we underline however that even if the mechanism were successful, it would not have
represented a full solution to the cosmological constant problem. rather, it would still
need some amount of tuning, such as explaining why exactly our wall would be located
at a place in the bulk where the bulk curvature would bend it by a right amount. but
this question may be related to the problem of moduli stabilization, and hence beyond
the scope of the formalism pursued here. however, if one assumes that the moduli can be
stabilized, then the location of the brane in the bulk may help explain why cosmological
constant would be small but nonzero.

the cosmology of models with dynamical extra dimensions is still at a very early stage,
and various investigations have been done so far [5, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20, 22, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32].
here we have considered a simple eective description of domain walls in 5d, and have
found that among the curved domain walls there is a profusion of those which are inating
in the longitudinal directions. but before such solutions can be viewed as candidates for
realistic models of brane cosmology, it must be possible for ination on the brane to end,
accomplishing many set requirements, such as producing enough density perturbations
and sucient reheating. here we will briey remark on some basic features of inationary
model building in the braneworld framework. the examples of inating walls show that

17

the wall ination, driven by some conventional inationary model on the wall which
controls the evolution when the bulk physics is weakly coupled, could also help with the
horizon problem in the bulk [9]. a conventional ination produces a positive cosmological
constant along the wall, which means that the wall will have positive tension. because
gravity in 5d will not be totally conned to the wall, and during ination driven by a
positive tension, the walls gravitational eld will repulse any objects in the bulk. this is
a well known property of domain walls in at 4d spacetime [23], and all solutions with
positive tension also share it. this could solve the bulk horizon problem as follows. when
the expansion of the brane is fast, both the brane and bulk horizons are small, close to the
fundamental scale. there will be many such suciently small causally isolated domains
which are almost smooth both along the brane and around it. they can therefore start
to inate. hence if ination on the wall lasts long enough and proceeds slowly, the
gravitational eld of the wall will push out inhomogeneities in the bulk very far away
from the wall. in this fashion, the bulk around the wall can also become homogeneous
during wall ination. another interesting aspect is the interplay of positive bulk and
brane cosmological terms, which can rapidly inate only the wall, while leaving the bulk
size almost constant. the resulting inationary expansion is then highly asymmetric, of
precisely the type discussed in the longwavelength limit in [11]. it may be necessary that
in order to realize this possibility the bulk degrees of freedom must be very light, or very
weakly coupled [5, 25, 9]. however, such models may emerge in theories which have large
extra dimensions, and thus this is certainly a possibility [10, 26].

writing down a concrete model is not as easy as it might seem, however. if the large
internal dimensions are stabilized with the bulk size smaller than the horizon length on
the wall, the approximation based on applying the usual 4d scenarios and ignoring the
gravitational eects in the extra dimensions is a good one, and scaled-down versions of
models such as [27]-[29] may apply. if the extra dimensions are dynamical, it may happen
that the 4d scenarios are still applicable [11]. in other scenarios the eects of gravity
in the extra dimensions may be signicant, as we have seen here (see also [22]), and
may require a dierent approach. an example we have noted here is the interplay of
the wall and the bulk physics via gravity, manifest in the role of the bulk event horizon.
this indicates that higher-dimensional dynamics in a generic situation warrants further
investigation.

. this completes our search for the single brane

let us now consider parallel branes. we will look for the solution with two branes by
taking (10) which describes one brane in ads5 as a background, and will t the other
brane in it, adjusting its tension as required. we will only consider the cases where the

20

bulk geometry can be foliated by a congruence of slices which are conformal to the 3-
branes. then away from the branes the original solution (44) would continue to solve the
rst of the eqs. (43), which explicitly gives

it is evident that (44) will satisfy this equation away from the branes, where -functions
vanish. to take into account the eect of the branes, we compactify the bulk on the
circle, w  w + wc, and further orbifold the circle by z2 operation w  w. then we
can substitute (44) into (53) and after some simple algebra nd the required matching

in mind that wc > 0 (we ignore branes lying on top of each other since they are indis-
tinguishable from single branes in our approach), and focusing rst on  > 0 case, it is
straightforward to verify that solutions exist in the following cases:

we now consider parallel branes when  < 0. all of these solutions can be thought
of as two parallel inating branes in the orbifold construction. again, by the orbifolding
