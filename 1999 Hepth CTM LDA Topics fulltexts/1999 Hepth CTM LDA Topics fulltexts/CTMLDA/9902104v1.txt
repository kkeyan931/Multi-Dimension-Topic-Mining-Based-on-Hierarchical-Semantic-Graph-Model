abstract

by using the approach of non-commutative geometry, we study spinors and scalars on the two
layers adsd+1 space. we have found that in the boundary of two layers adsd+1 space, by using the
ads/cft correspondence, we have a logarithmic conformal eld theory. this observation propose a
way to get the quantum eld theory in the context of non-commutative geometry.

introduction

various aspects of the correspondence between eld theories in (d + 1)dimensional anti de sitter space
(ads) and ddimensional conformal eld theories (cfts) has been studied in the last few months. an
important example is the conjectured correspondence between the large n limits of certain conformal
eld theories in ddimensions and supergravity on the product of a (d + 1)dimensional ads space with
a compact manifold [1]. this suggested correspondence was made more precise in [2, 3].

the general correspondence between a theory on an ads and a conformal theory on the boundary of
ads is the following. consider the partition function of a eld theory on ads, subjected to the constraint

|ads = 0,

(1.1)

that is zads(0) = r0

d exp[is()], where the functional integration is over congurations satisfying
(1.1). it is well known that the symmetry algebra of a (d + 1)dimensional ads is o(d,2), which is the
same as the conformal algebra on a d dimensional minkowski space. from this, it is seen that zads(0)
is invariant under conformal transformations, and this is the root of the analogy between theories on
ads and conformal theories on ads.
in fact, if   o, is a spacetime symmetry of the theory
d exp[is()], which means that
zads(o10) = zads(0). so, one can use zads(0) as the generating function of a conformally invariant
theory on the boundary of ads, with 0 as the current.

on ads, it is seen that zads(o10) = r0

d(o) exp[is(o)], = r0

the notion of the boundary of an ads needs, however, some care. an adsd+1 is a (d+ 1)dimensional
hypersurface in rd+2 equiped with the metric  = diag(1,1, 1, , 1). the equation of this hypersur-
face is (x 1)2 + (x 0)2  pd
i=1(x i)2 = 1. this is a connected hyperboloid in rd+2. by boundary, it is
meant the points satisfying

d

xi=1

(x i)2 = r2  .

(1.2)

the above set (for xed r) is the ddimensional sapce s  sd1. as r  , this space tends to a space
which is locally rd, since the radii of s and sd1 are r2 + 1 and r, respectively.
x 1+x d , the length element is

using the coordinate transformation x i = xi

xd =

1

seen to take the form

xd , i 6= d,1;

ds2 = (dx0)2 +pd

(xd)2

i=1(dxi)2

.

(1.3)

almost all of the boundary is now contained in xd = 0. there are, however, points satisfying (1.2),
but not x 1 + x d  .these points serve as compactiers of rd to s  sd1. we use the length
element (1.3), and use xd = 0 as the boundary of ads. in this case, the boundary will be a ddimensional
minkowski space.

the abovementioned correspondence have been studied for various cases, e. g. a free massive scalar
eld and a free u(1) gauge theory [3], an interacting massive scalar eld theory [4], free massive spinor eld
theory [5], and interacting massive spinor-scalar eld theory [6]. also, the group-theoretic interprtation
of correspondence has been studied in [7]. our aim in this article is to shed light, in one hand, to
the correspondence between theories on the non-commutative ads spaces and logarithmic conformal
eld theories (lcfts), and in the other hand, to the construction of quantum eld theory in the non-
commutative geometry. let us rst review a brief of lcfts and ads/lcft correspondence and non-
commutative geometry.

2 a brief review of logarithmic conformal eld theories

it has been shown by gurarie [8], that conformal eld theories whose correlation functions exhibit loga-
rithmic behaviour, can be consistently dened. it is shown that if in the ope of two local elds, there
exist at least two elds with the same conformal dimension, one may nd some special operators, known
as logarithmic operators. as discussed in [8], these operators with the ordinary operators form the basis of
a jordan cell for the lis (the generators of the conformal algebra). in some interesting physical theories,

1

one can naturally nd logarithmic terms in the correlators of theories. [9], logarithmic conformal eld
theories for ddimensional case (d > 2) has also been studied [10]. the basic properties of logarithmic
operators are that they form a part of the basis of the jordan cell for lis, generators of the virasoro
algebra, and in the correlator of such elds there is a logarithmic singularity [8]. in [11] assuming confor-
mal invariance two and threepoint functions for the case of one or more logarithmic elds in a block,
and one or more sets of logarithmic elds have been explicitly calculated. regarding logarithmic elds
formally as derivatives of ordinary elds with respect to their conformal dimension, npoint functions
containing logarithmic elds have been calculated in terms of those of ordinary elds. these have been
done when conformal weights belong to a discrete set. in [12], logarithmic conformal eld theories with
continuous weights have been considered. it is shown in [11] that if the set of weights is discrete, when
the jordan cell for li is two dimensional, there are two elds o and o, with the following two-point
functions
(2.1)

ho(x)o(y)i = 0,
c

ho(x)o(y)i =

|x  y|2 ,

(2.2)

(2.3)

ho(x)o(y)i =

1

|x  y|2 (c  2c ln|x  y|) .

in [13] another type of derivation is also introduced. the main idea of this construction is based
on the formal derivation of the entities of the original system with respect to a parameter, which may
or may not explicitly appear in the original theory. one way of viewing this is through the concept of
contraction: consider two systems with parameters  and  + . these two systems are independent to
each other. one can write an action as the dierence of the actions of the two system divided by  to
describe both systems. one can use one of these degrees of freedom and the dierence of them divided
by  a new set of variables. this system, however, is equivalent to two copies of the original system.
but if one lets  tend to zero, a welldened theory of double number of variables is obtained, which no
longer can be decomposed to two independent parts. one can, however, solve this theory in terms of the
solution of the original theory. this procedure is nothing but a contraction. it has been shown in [14] that
any symmetry, and any constant of motion of the original theory, results in a symmetry and a constant
of motion of the derived one and any theory derived from an integrable theory is integrable. at last, it
has also been shown that this technique is applicable to classical eld theories as well. this technique
is applicable to quantum systems as well. here, however, a novel property arises: the derived quantum
theory is almost classical; that is, in the derived theory there are only oneloop quantum corrections to
the classical action [14]. using this property, one can calculate all of the green functions of the derived
theory exactly, even though this may be not the case for the original theory.
using the ads/cft correspondence, in [15], a correspondence between eld theories in (d+1)dimensional
ads space and ddimensional logarithmic conformal eld theories has been obtained. it has been showed
that by a suitable choice of action in adsd+1, one gets a lcft on the ads. in general, using any eld
theory on ads, which corresponds to a cft on ads, one can systematically construct other theories
on ads corresponding to lcfts on ads.
in 1989, alain connes and john lott obtained the lagrangian of the standard model by an algebraic-
geometrical approach which is called non-commutative geometry or spectral geometry [16]. they consid-
ered a two layers minkowskian space-time , which each layer endowed by a suitable bundle for describing
the u (1)  su (2) gauge symmetry. what they really has been obtained was a generalized yang-mills
theory in which the higgs potential appears naturally. this higgs eld seems to be the component of
the generalized gauge eld in the direction of discretnes of space. but there was some diculties in their
approach such as their fermions hilbert space does not match with the phenomenological standard model
lagrangian [17] and another problem was due to the existance of some relations between some parameters
of the theory such as the mass of the higgs and top quark [18]. these relations are not consistent
with the ow of renormalization of this parameters [19]. the reason for the latter problem is said to be
due to taking the incorrect geometrical space which is a two layers commutative minkowski space (or in
other words the classical space). by commutative space, we mean that the algebra which describes the
space-time is c(m ) which is the commutative c-algebra. now if one modies this algebra to some
non-commutative or quantum algebra, he or she can derives standard model which is in accordance with

2

phenomenological standard model with the same number of free parameters.
in this paper, we take the appraoch of non-commutative geometry and by using the holographic principle
and in fact in its special version, ads/cft correspondence and using commutative or in other words,
the classical space to obtain a classical theory and relating it to a quantum theory on the boundary of
the space-time. in fact in this article, we will build a simple toy model for spinors and scalars in adsd+1
space by using the generalized dirac operator and we will show that on the boundary of the adsd+1,
there will be a logarithmic conformal quantum eld theory. so in this article we will propose, how to
obtain a quantum eld theory from a classical space-time in the non-commutative geometry by using the
holographic principle.

3 a brief review of non-commutative geometry

in non-commutative geometry, we express the topological space (which is assumed to be compact) by
a unital c-algebra a which is commutative in the case of ordinary manifolds. then for endowing
this algebra with a dierential structure, we need the k-cycle (h,d), where h is the hilbert space for
representating the elements of a as the linear operators and d is called the generalized dirac opera-
tor. the role of k-cycle for non-commutative geometry is similar to the role of dierential structure in
ordinary dierential geometry. having a k-cycle, one can develop a dierential algebra (a) for the
non-commutative space which is equivalent to dierential geometry for the manifolds. for this purpose,
we assume d to be an abstract dierential operator which acts on the elements of a and satises the
leibnitz rule, with d1 = 0 and d2a = 0, where 1, a  a. then the p-forms in (a) are dened as,
0, ai
ai
 = pi ai
p  a, and also the representation of  in h is shown by () and
is dened by, () = pi (a0
i )]. as a simple example, consider a euclidean spin
manifold m. for such manifolds, we should take a the algebra of complex valued functions on m,
a := c(m). then d is the ordinary dirac operator d = / = . according to the above denition,
we have, (df ) = [d, f ], f  a, which gives (df ) = [, f ] = f = (df ), where df is the ordinary
one-form, df = f dx. in fact it is well known that if we endowe the vector space of ordinary one-
forms with the cliord multiplication, then the s are the matrix representation of the dxs, and the
 = [, ] play the role of dx  dx for the two-forms.
as we mentioned above, when we dene a k-cycle (h,d), we have a hilbert space h which we call its
vectors as spinor . then in corresponding to ordinary lagrangian for spin 1
2 particles, one can take the
following statement as the generalized spin 1

(3.1)

in fact, one can take the dirac operator d such that the suitable mass term emerges naturally in the
above statement. in the case of spin 0 particles in accordance to klein-gordon action, one can dene the
non-commutative geometric action as follows,

s =

statement,  is some gradation operator.

in the above

4 two layers ads space and spin 1

2 lagrangian

at this stage, let us take a two layers space as our topological space. a suitable algebra which discribes
it, is a = c(ads)  m2(c), where by c(ads), we mean the algebra of complex continous functions
dened on ads, and by m2(c), we mean the algebra of 2 2 complex matrices. then as a representation
for the elements of a, we choose the following representation, (a) = (cid:18) f1(x)
a  a. in
fact, this representation among the others has a simple interpretation, simply f1(x) and f2(x) can be
interpreted as functions on each ads spaces. here we can split our hilbert space h into two hilbert
spaces h1 and h2, which each of them corresponds to one ads layer. so it is logical to dene a gradation

operator  = (cid:18) 1
spinors as (cid:18) 1

0 1(cid:19) for showing the splitting of the hilbert space h, and we can represent our
2(cid:19) . now, it is the time to dene our dirac operator to complete the denition of our

k-cycle. we take it as follows,

d = (cid:18) / + m

m (/ + m)(cid:19) ; m, m  c  1dd.

so according to eq. (3.1) for spin 1

2 lagrangian, we have,

l = d = ( 1, 2)(cid:18) /  m

m (/ + m)(cid:19)(cid:18) 1

= 1(/ + m)1 + 1m 2  2(/ + m)2 + 2m 1.

(4.1)

(4.2)

it seems to be logical to take the physics of both ads spaces identical, which means 1 and 2 to be the
same. so at this stage, we take 1 and 2 as follows, 1 = 1
2 (+  ), where  is
an innitesimal number. now in terms of these new spinors , the lagrangian can be written as follows,

2 (+ + ), 2 = 1

l = +(/ + m) + (/ + m)+ + +m +,

(4.3)

which we have redened the elds p 

2  as . however, as observed in [5], to obtain the non-vanishing
on-shell spinor action in the usual ads space, one must add to the massive free spinor action a boundary
term. for such a boundary term in the non-commutative geometry, we take the following boundary
lagrangian,

(4.4)
where | boundary > is the projection of |  > on the boundary of adsd+1. hence the total lagrangian of
spinors system on the two layers ads space is,

lboundary =< boundary |  | boundary >,

ltot = +(/ + m) + (/ + m)+ + +m +

+ { +(boundary)(boundary) + (boundary)+(boundary)}(xd).

by using the same method of ref.

5 two layers ads space and scalar eld lagrangian

in this section, we consider the action (3.2) which we have introduced it for the scalar eld as the
generalization of massive klein-gordon action in the non-commutative geometry. for the two layers ads
space, we take the dirac operator as same as (4.1). as it was mentioned in section 3, the scalar elds
are elements of the algebra a, and again we take the following representation for the elements of a in
hilbert space h, () = (cid:18) 1(x)
2(x)(cid:19) , where 1(x) and 2(x) are functions in c(ads). by using

(5.2)

(5.3)

in the ref.
[15], by an explicit calculation, it has been showed that the projection elds (0) and
+(0) obtained through the elds  and + by restricting them to the boundary of the adsd+1, are
the currents for the conformal operators, o+ and o respectively. in fact, the twopoint correlation
functions of the operators o+ and o which live in the boundary of adsd+1 are in the following form;
the correlation function of o(x) and o(y) vanishes as the relation (2.1). the correlation function of
o(x) and o+(y) is in the scaling form (2.2) and the correlation function of o+(x) and o+(y) is in the
logarithmic form (2.3). the constants c and c which appear in the correlation functions (2.2) and (2.3)
are related to the parameters m and m appearing in (5.3). this shows that in the boundary of two layers
ads space, which is in fact a non-commutative double sheets d dimensional minkowski space, we have
a quantum eld theory. also, we note that by using a generalized action for the interacting scalr eld in
the two layers ads space, one naturally get the npoint correlation functions of a quantum eld theory
in the ddimensional non-commutative minkowski spaces [15].

6 conclusions

in this article, we have shown how one can use the approach of non-commutative geometry to obtain a
classical eld theory for the spinor and scalar elds in the classical or commutative spaces (i.e. the spaces
which can be expressed by a commutative algebra). we have used a two layers anti de sitter space and by
the above mentioned approach, we have obtained a classical eld theory for spinors and scalars in the bulk
space. however by considering the ads/cft correspondence, our goal is to correspond the generating
functions of these theories to the quantum correlation functions of a logarithmic conformal eld theory on
the boundaries of the two layers ads space. this consideration makes an idea for solving the parameters
restriction in connes-lott model for the geometrization of standard model. in fact if someone tries to
obtain the connes-lott model in the boundary of a two layer space with the appropriate higgs potential
by considering a suitable theory in the bulk, then the theory on the boundary is a quantum theory,
without any parameters restriction. this is what we are going to show explicitly in near future.
