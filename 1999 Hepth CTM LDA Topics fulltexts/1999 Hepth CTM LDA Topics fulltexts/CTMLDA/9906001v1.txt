abstract

it is pointed out that the parke-taylor or maximally helicity violat-
ing amplitudes in the pure yang-mills can, after some specications,
be interpreted as amplitudes of scattering of massive vector bosons in
the higgs-yang-mills system.

although, in general, multi-particle tree amplitudes are compli-
cated things (because the number of various feynman diagrams grows
very fast with the number of legs), see, e.g., the review [1] and more
recent reviews [2], [3], in some instances one can explicitly construct
innite sets of tree amplitudes, as it was done in [4], [5], [6].

the basic example is [4], where nice explicit expressions for the so-
called maximally helicity violating (mhv) amplitudes in yang-mills
(ym) have been conjectured (these expressions have been proved in
[7]). mhv amplitudes are gluonic amplitudes with arbitrary number
of legs and most of the external gluons in the same helicity states.
more precisely, mhv amplitudes describe scattering of two positive
helicity gluons into any number of positive helicity gluons. that is
the restriction on polarizations which allows one to obtain the explicit
formulae for the amplitudes with arbitrary number of legs. perhaps,
the simplest procedure to obtain mhv amplitudes has been developed
in [8] following ideas of [9], [10]. the procedure was to obtain the
positive helicity gluonic form-factors via a solution of the self-duality
equation and the mhv amplitudes via a solution of the linearization
of ym equations in the self-dual background. in these terms mhv
amplitudes are amplitudes of scattering of two anti-self-dual gluons

into a number of the self-dual ones. (notice that a positive helicity
gluon is self-dual in the out- state and anti-self-dual in the in- state.)
the purpose of the present letter is to point out that the mhv
amplitudes can, after some specications, be identied as a set of am-
plitudes in the spontaneously broken symmetry phase in the higgs-
yang-mills (hym) system with adjoint higgs eld in the bps limit1.
in the hym interpretation, the mhv amplitudes assume more re-
strictions imposed on the external particles. first of all, there is a
kinematical restriction that all the external particles in this set of am-
plitudes have zero momentum along a xed coordinate axis. there
is also a restriction on polarizations, namely, all w + bosons have a
positive projection of spin onto the xed axis, while all w  bosons
have negative spin projection onto it. we shall call such one-particle
states as the bps ones, because they are solutions of linearized bps
equations (in +   signature). the hym counterparts of the mhv
amplitudes are then the amplitudes for scattering of a couple of anti-
bps particles into any number of the bps ones.

the simplest way to obtain this interpretation is to use the kaluza-
klein dimensional reduction (see [11]). so, consider 5d ym on m4s1

s = z d4xdytr

with xed monodromy around s1:

p exp{z dya5} = exp{2ira3}

(1)

(2)

where m, n = 0, . . . , 4, 3 - the pauli matrix, 2r - circumference of
s1, a - a constant. the low energy eective theory of this model in
the limit ra  1 is 4d hym system with adjoint higgs eld having
vev a3 in the bps limit. let us see how this happens.

in view of eq.(2), one can choose a gauge so that

a = ia3dy + (. . .)

(3)

where (. . .) stands for terms periodical in y with periods 2r. then
eq.(1) is rewritten as follows

s = z d4xtr

1we stick on the case of su(2) gauge group, though it is not necessary.

where i  a5, ,  = 0, . . . , 3. according to eq.(3),  is assumed to
have vev

<  >= a3

(5)

the kk modes decouple in the low energy limit. note that there is
no higgs potential in eq.(4) which corresponds to the bps limit.

the low-energy spectrum of the model eq.(4) with the su(2) gauge
group is known to consist of a photon (two states), a massless higgs
(one state), a massive w + boson (three states) and a massive w 
bosons (three states), both with the mass 4a2.

one can also describe these states in terms of 5d ym. in order to
do this, it is convenient to gauge away the monodromy, eq.(2), by the
gauge transformation with the matrix

g = eiay3

(6)

the price for that will be non-periodicity in y of the gauge potential
a:

a(y + 2r) = e2ira3 a(y)e2ira3

(7)

one sees that after such gauge transformation the plane waves corre-
sponding to w  bosons get a component of momentum along y-axis,
namely

w + : k5 = 2a
w  : k5 = 2a

(8)

notice that the 5d momenta, made out of the physical 4d ones and
k5 component, are light-like.

let us now consider in the 5d ym only amplitudes with the kine-
matical restriction that all the external particles have zero momen-
tum along one of the axis in the physical 4d space, say, k3 = 0 for
all the external particles. thus the problem becomes eectively four-
dimensional in the non-physical 4d space spanned by x0, x1, x2, y. in
this non-physical 4d space we shall use the spinor notation,

x  =   x0 + y
k  =   k0 + k5

x1 + ix2 x0  y !
k1 + ik2 k0  k5 !

x1  ix2

k1  ik2

,  = 1, 2. notice that momenta of the w -bosons are light-like in the
non-physical 4d space as well as in 5d space. since they are light-like,
they can be decomposed as follows:

k  =   

where  and   are some spinors. the reality condition reads

  = ()

(11)

(12)

now, consider the mhv amplitudes in this non-physical 4d space,
that is, amplitudes of scattering of two anti-self-dual gluons into a
number of self-dual gluons. these amplitudes are represented as
follows [4],[7]:

a(1, 2  3+, . . . , d+) = i(1, 2)4 xsd/zd

t r(j(1) . . . j(d))

((1), (2))((2), (3)) . . . ((d), (1))

(13)

where sum is taken over non-cyclically permutations, js are the color
matrixes of the particles, s are the spinors entering the momenta of
the particles, as in eq.(11), and the brackets of two s stand for their
contraction with the antisymmetric tensor:

(1, 2)  

(14)

the self-duality (or anti-self-duality) is assumed in the non-physical
4d space. it is known to be equivalent to the bps equation in the
hym terms (in the signature + in the present context). by study-
ing solutions of linearized eld equations and transforming a self-dual
plane wave from the gauge where eq.(7) takes place to the one where
eq.(3) is valid, one can verify that the self-duality in the non-physical
4d space assumes the restriction on polarizations of w  described
above.

to adopt the amplitudes eq.(13) to the present context one needs
just to specify the color matrixes. the amplitude is nonzero when
there are equal amounts of w + and w . then the amplitudes of
scattering of 2 massive anti-bps particles into 2d  2 massive bps
particles read

where l1, l2, . . . , ld are all dierent and run over set numbering w +
bosons and m1, m2, . . . , md are all dierent and run over set num-
bering w  bosons . we would like to emphasize that the spinors
entering eq.(15) arose via decomposition of the type of eq.(11) from
the non-physical momenta of the particles eq.(10). in particular,
the condition eq.(8) in terms of the spinors is rewritten as

w + :

w  :

|1|2  |2|2 = 4a
|1|2  |2|2 = 4a

(16)

one can also obtain amplitudes for a dierent process - scattering
of two w -bosons with zero spin projections onto the xed axis (and
zero momentum along the xed axis) into any number of the bps
w -bosons. such amplitudes vanish.

we have explained how the mhv amplitudes in pure ym can
be interpreted as a set of amplitudes of scattering of massive vector
bosons in hym in the bps limit (nontrivial vev but no potential for
the higgs eld). the main tool was the kaluza-klein reduction from
5d ym to 4d hym. analogously, using the kaluza-klein reduction
from 6d ym to 4d hym with two adjoint higgs elds, one can ob-
tain from the mhv amplitudes a set of amplitudes of scattering of
massive particles in a theory with nontrivial higgs potential. in more
complicated versions of the kaluza-klein reduction one can obtain the
amplitudes with fundamental higgs elds.
