abstract

we study the structure of holomorphic eective action for hypermultiplet models

interacting with background super yang-mills elds. a general form of holomorphic

eective action is found for hypermultiplet belonging to arbitrary representation of

any semisimple compact lie group spontaneously broken to its maximal abelian

subgroup. the applications of obtained results to hypermultiplets in fundamental

and adjoint representations of the su(n), so(n), sp(n) groups are considered.

one of the remarkable properties of supersymmetric eld theories is an existence of two

types of eective lagrangians, chiral and general or holomorphic and non-holomorphic. general

or non-holomorphic lagrangian contributes to eective action in form of integral over full super-

space while chiral or holomorphic lagrangian contributes to eective action in form of integral

over chiral subspace. we point out that an appearance of holomorphic corrections to eective

action was rstly demonstrated in refs [1]-[4] (see also [5], [6]) for n = 1 susy and in refs [7],

[8] for n = 2 susy.

the modern interest to eective action in n = 2 supersymmetric theories is conditioned

by the work [9] where exact instanton contribution to holomorphic eective potential has been

found for n = 2 su(2) super yang-mills model. generalization of this result to theories with

the gauge groups su(n) and so(n) have been given in refs [10], [11].

it is well known, a most simple and clear way of studying of eective action in susy models

is based on a formulation of these models in terms of unconstrained superelds. namely such

a formulation provides a possibility to preserve a manifest supersymmetry at all stages of

quantum calculations. for n = 2 susy the corresponding formalism was developed in refs

[12] and was called harmonic superspace approach.

in this note we study a structure of holomorphic eective action for the theory of hyper-

multiplet coupled to external super yang-mills eld in harmonic superspace approach. it is

assumed that the hypermultiplet belongs to arbitrary representation of any semisimple com-

pact lie group and the external supereld lies in cartan subalgebra of the corresponding lie

algebra.

holomorphic eective action for hypermultiplets coupled to abelian gauge supereld has

been obtained in harmonic superspace approach in refs [13], [14] as follows

q,[v ++] = z d4xd4fq,(w ) + c.c.,

fq,(w ) = 

kq,
642

w 2 log

,

1 for qhypermultiplet

2 for hypermultiplet.

kq, = 


here w is the strength of n = 2 gauge prepotential v ++ [12], [15]

(1)

(2)

w = z du( d)2v ++(x, , u),

w = z du(d)2v ++(x, , u).

the q- and -hypermultiplets have been described in refs [12]. function fq,(w ) is called the

holomorphic potential.

in this note we consider the q- and -hypermultiplets q+ and  in an arbitrary representa-

tion of some semisimple compact gauge group. let ei (i = 1, . . . , m) be a basis in representation

1

space v, dim v = m, and ti be the generators of the representation forming a basis in lie al-

gebra l. these hypermultiplets and non-abelian gauge supereld v ++ can be written in the

forms

q+ =

xi=1

xi=1

v ++ = xk

(3)

(4)

the classical actions of the hypermultiplets coupled to the external supereld v ++ look like as

follows

s[q+, q+, v ++] = z d (4) q+(d++ + iv ++)q+

s[, , v ++] = z d (4)(d++   i v ++)(d++ + iv ++).

(5)

(6)

we use the denotations like in refs [13], [14]. manifest form of the terms v ++q+, v ++

depends on representation, e.g., in the adjoint representation these terms are understood as
the commutators. the expression q+d++q+ means q+

j (ei, ej) where (ei, ej) is a scalar

i d++q+

product of vectors in a representation space.

further we assume that the external supereld v ++ lies in the cartan subalgebra h of

gauge algebra l. therefore

v ++ =

v ++

k hk,

l

xk=1

(7)

where l = rankl and {h1, . . . , hl} is a basis in h.

the main idea of subsequent consideration is to reduce a calculation of eective actions for

the models (5), (6) to calculation of eective actions for hypermultiplets in abelian external

gauge supereld and use the result (1). to do that, we diagonalise the actions (5), (6) and

obtain several one-dimensional hypermultiplets in abelian gauge superelds. the realization

of this idea is based on use of notion of the weights of lie group representation.

the weight subspaces v  of representation space v are dened as follows [19]

v  = {v  v | hv = (h)v, h  h}.

(8)

let the equation (8) have m = dim v roots (weights) i (some of which may be equal) and

corresponding eigenvectors ei be orthogonal

(ei, ej) = ij.

(9)

we choose vectors ei as the basis in representation space and expand hypermultiplets (3) in

this basis. with the help of relation (8) it is easy to nd the action of gauge supereld v ++ on

2

the hypermultiplets

v ++q+ =

m

xi=1

q+
i i(v ++)ei,

v ++ =

m

xi=1

ii(v ++)ei.

(10)

it is easy to see that functions i(v ++) are linear i(v ++) = i(hk)v ++
have u(1) charge +2, the same as the charge of v ++. substituting the hypermultiplets (3) into

, so the weights i(v ++)

k

actions (5), (6) and using eqs (9), (10) we obtain

s[ q+, q+, v ++] = z d (4)

m

xi=1

i (d++ + ii(v ++))q+
q+
i ,

s[ , , v ++] = z d (4)

m

xi=1

(d++  ii(v ++))i(d++ + ii(v ++))i.

(11)

(12)

the hypermultiplets labeled by dierent indices in (11), (12) do not mix between themselves,

therefore their classical actions are the sums of actions of non-coupled one-dimensional hy-

permultiplets. hence, holomorphic eective actions of models (11), (12) are represented as a

sum of independent one-dimensional eective actions (1) over all weights of representation

q,[v ++] = z d4xd4fq,(w ) + c.c., fq,(w ) = 

kq,
642

m

xi=1

(13)

where wi are constructed of weights i(v ++) according to (2).

thus we have obtained the eective actions of q- and -hypermultiplets in arbitrary rep-

resentation of any semisimple gauge group (13), they are expressed via weights of the repre-

sentation. it is well known that any irreducible representation is completely determined by its

highest weight  and all other weights of representation are expressed of  (see [19])

(h) = (h)  m11(h)  m22(h)  . . .  mkk(h), h  h,

(14)

where i(h) are simple roots of algebra l, m1, . . . , mk are non-negative integers. hence, we see

the eective action (13) is actually determined by highest weight .

now we are ready to write down holomorphic eective actions of q- and -hypermultiplets

in the fundamental and adjoint representations of su(n), so(n), sp(n) groups. to do this we

have to x cartan subalgebra of each group, nd all weights of corresponding representation,

and substitute these weights into (13). using the weights of representations and structure

of the cartan subalgebras given in the appendix one obtain holomorphic eective actions of

hypermultiplets on the base of eq. (13). below we give a list of corresponding holomorphic

eective potentials:

by the rule (2).

some of these results were obtained earlier in refs [10, 11, 16, 17, 18] by dierent methods.

in our approach the holomorphic eective actions are easily obtained on the base of single

method from the general expression (13).

to conclude, in the present paper we have considered the hypermultiplet models coupled to

n = 2 nonabelian gauge supereld using the harmonic superspace formalism. we obtained the

holomorphic eective actions of these models for the general case when hypermultiplets belong

to arbitrary representation of any semisimple gauge

group and gauge supereld lies in cartan subalgebra of the gauge algebra. then we applied

these results to nd the eective actions of q- and -hypermultiplets in fundamental and adjoint

representations of su(n), so(n), sp(n) groups.

appendix

we formulate a list of useful properties of considered algebras such as the structures of cartan

4

subalgebras and weights of fundamental and adjoint representations. these properties have

been used to obtain the eective potentials (15)-(20) (see the details in refs [19], [20]).

sponding weights of fundamental representation have been chosen in the form

2. adjoint representation.

in adjoint representation the weight subspaces coincide with the root subspaces in a gauge

algebra and the weights of the representation are the roots of algebra. therefore we have to x

cartan-weyl basis in each considered algebra and write down its roots.

we point out, the structure of eective potentials (16)-(20) is dened by the choice of basis

vectors given above and the coecients in eective potentials depend on the normalisation of

these vectors.
