abstract

from the topological properties of a three dimensional vector order parame-

ter, the topological current of point defects is obtained. one shows that the

charge of point defects is determined by hopf indices and brouwer degrees.

the evolution of point defects is also studied. one concludes that there exist

crucial cases of branch processes in the evolution of point defects when the

jacobian d( 

x ) = 0.

i. introduction

in recent years, an outstanding development in the theory of condensed matter is to

study the defect by topology. it has provided new insights and spectacular predictions. in

particular there has been progress on the study the defects associated with a nonconserved

n-component vector order parameter eld ~(~r, t) [1,2]. in studying such objects in physics

arise to how one can dene quantity like the density of defects. here comes the important

conjecture proposed by halperin, liu and mazenko [3,4], the density of such system has

been wrote as

corresponding author e-mail: itp2@lzu.edu.cn

 = (~)d(/x),

(1)

which is the fundamental equation for such problem.

in this paper, we will present a new topological current involved in 4-dimensional system

by use of the -mapping topological current theory, which is important in studying the topo-

logical invariant and structure of physics systems and has been used to study topological

current of magnetic monopole [5], topological string theory [6], topological characteristics

of dislocations and disclinations continuum [7], topological structure of the defects of space-

time in the early universe as well as its topological bifurcation [8,9], topological structure of

gauss-bonnet-chern theorem [10,11] and topological structure of the london equation in

superconductor [12]. it is shown that the topological charges of defects can be classied by

brower degree and hopf index of the -mapping. it must be pointed out that the existence of

this topological current is inevitable and necessary, which carries all the important topologi-

cal properties of this physical system, and includes the defect density even other conjectures

given by liu and mazenko [4]. the further research shows that there exist the crucial cases

of branch process in the evolution of the point defects when the jacobian d( 

x ) = 0. we

calculate the dierent branches of the worldlines of defects by using the implicit function

theorem. it is found that the worldlines of point defects will split or merge at the critical

points.

ii. the topological current of point defects

consider a 4-dimensional system with a nonconserved 3-component vector order param-

eter eld ~(~r, t).

in order to compose a topological current, we introduce a unit vector

eld

where

na =

,

a
||||

a = 1, 2, 3

||||2 = aa.

2

(2)

~(x) is just the vector order parameter. the topological current of this system is given by

j =

1
8 123a1a2a3 1na12na23na3.

it is clear that the topological current is identically conserved, i.e.

j = 0.

the topological charge density correspondingly will be dened as

 = j0.

(3)

(4)

(5)

so, eq. (4) is just the continuity equation of this system. considering the following formula

na =

1


a + a

1


,

we can write eq. (3) as

j =

if we dene

(

).

a1a2a3 d(

in which j 0(

) = d(

) =

and make use of the 3-dimensional laplacian greens function relation

(

1
||||

) = 43(~)

where  is the 3-dimensional laplacian operator in  space, we do obtain the  function
like current

3

j = 3(~)d(


x

).

when  = 0, we know that the density of j can be written as

 = 3(~)d(


x

).

from this expression, we nd that j  does not vanish only when ~ = 0, i.e.

a(t, x1, x2, x3) = 0,

a = 1, 2, 3.

(6)

(7)

(8)

suppose that the vector eld ~ possesses l zeroes (i.e., there exist l point defects) denoted

as zi(i = 1, ..., l ). according to the implicit function theorem [13], when the zeros points ~zi

are the regular points of ~ which requires the jacobian

d(


x

)|zi = d0(


x

)|zi 6= 0.

the solutions of eq. (8) can be generally obtained:

~x = ~zi(t)

i = 1, 2, ..., l

(9)

(10)

which represent the worldlines of l point defects moving in space. from eq. (8), it is easy

to prove that

d(


x

)|zi = d(


x

)|zi

dx
dt

.

so, the topological current (3) can be rigorously expressed as

j  = 3(~)d(


x

)

dx
dt

as we proved in ref. [9], we have

j  =

l

xi=1

ii3(~x  ~zi)

dx
dt |zi,

(11)

(12)

(13)

where the positive integer i is the hopf index and i = signd(/x)zi = 1 is brouwer
degree [5,7]. according to eq. (13), the density of topological charge can be rewritten as

4

 = j 0 =

l

xi=1

ii3(~x  ~zi).

(14)

it is clearly that the inner structure of this system is characterized by hopf indices i and

brouwer degrees i, which are topological invariants. from discussions above, we see that the

density (x) is similar to a system of l classical point-like particles with topological charge

ii moving in the 4-dimensional space-time. the topological charge ii is also called the

topological charge of the ith point defect and (x) can be regarded as the density of defects.

and , solution (10) can be regarded as the trajectory of the ith defect. from formula (14),

we obtain that the total charge of the system

q = z (x)d3x =

l

xi=1

ii.

(15)

the result (7) also has been carried out by halperin [3], and exploited by liu and

mazenko [4]: the rst ingredient is the rather obvious result

x

(~r  ~r(t)) = (~(~r, t)) | d(


x

) |

where the second factor on the right-hand side is just the jacobian of the transformation

from the variable ~ to ~r. this is combined with the less obvious result

to give

 = sgnd(/x) |~r

(~r, t) = x

(~r  ~r(t)) = (~)d(/x).

(16)

here we see that the result (16) obtained by halperin, liu and mazenko is not complete.

they did not considering the cases l

6= 1 and d(/x) = 0, i.e., l is indenite.

it is

interesting to discuss what will happen and what does it correspond to in physics when

d(/x) = 0.

iii. the bifurcation of worldlines of point defects

as being discussed before, the zeros of the smooth vector ~ (locations of defects) play

important roles in studying the evolution of point defect. in this section, we will study the

properties of the zero points, in other words, the properties of the solutions of following

equations

1(x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0

2(x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0

.

3(x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0

(17)




as we knew before, if the jacobian determinant

d(


x

)|zi = d0(


x

)|zi 6= 0

we will have the isolated solutions (10) of eq. (17). the isolated solutions are called regular

points. it is easy to see that the results in section ii is based on this condition. however,

when this condition fails, the above results will change in some way, and will lead to the

branch process of topological density and give rise to the bifurcation. we denote one of zero

points as (t, ~zi).

a. the branch process at a limit point

it is well-known that when the jacobian d( 

x )|(t,~zi) = 0, the usual implicit function

theorem is no use. but if the jacobian

d1(


x

)|(t,~zi) =

(1, 2, 3)
(t, x2, x3) |(t,~zi) 6= 0,

we can use the jacobian d1( 

x )|(t,~zi), for the purpose of using the
implicit function theorem [13]. then we have an unique solution of eqs. (17) in the neigh-

x )|(t,~zi) instead of d( 

borhood of the point (t, ~zi)

t = t(x1)

6

xi = xi(x1)

i = 2, 3.

(18)

with t = t(x1). and we call the critical points (t, ~zi) the limit points. in the present case,

it is easy to know that

i.e.

dx1
dt |(t,~zi) =

d1( 
d( 

x )|(t,~zi)
x )|(t,~zi)

= 

dt
dx1|(t,~zi) = 0.

then we have the taylor expansion of eq. (18) at the point (t, ~zi)

t = t +

therefore

t  t =

2

d2t
i )2
(dx1)2|(t,~zi)(x1  z1

(19)

(20)

which is a parabola in the x1  t plane. from eq. (20), we can obtain two worldlines of
two point defects x1
2(t), which give the branch solutions of the system (17). if
(dx1)2|(t,~zi) > 0, we have the branch solutions for t > t, otherwise, we have the branch
solutions for t > t. it is clear that these two cases are related to the origin and annihilation

1(t) and x1

d2t

of point defects. since the topological charge of point defect is identically conserved, the

topological charge of these two must be opposite at the zero point, i.e.

i1i1 = i2i2.

(21)

one of the result of eq. (19), that the velocity of point defects is innite when they are

annihilating, agrees with that obtained by bray [14] who has a scaling argument associated

with point defects nal annihilation which leads to large velocity tail. from eq. (19), we

also get a new result that the velocity of point defects is innite when they are generating,

which is gained only from the topology of the three dimensional vector order parameter.

7

for a limit point, it also requires the d1( 

x )|(t,~zi) 6= 0. as to a bifurcation point [15],
it must satisfy a more complement condition. this case will be discussed in the following

subsections in detail.

b. the branch process at a bifurcation point

in this subsection, we have the restrictions of the system (17) at the bifurcation point

(t, ~zi):




d( 

d1( 

x )|(t,~zi) = 0
x )|(t,~zi) = 0

(22)

these will lead to an important fact that the function relationship between t and x1

is not unique in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point (~zi, t). it is easy to see from

equation

dx1
dt |(t,~zi)=

d1( 
d( 

x )|(t,~zi)
x )|(t,~zi)

(23)

which under the restraint (22) directly shows that the direction of the worldlines of point

defects is indenite at the point (~zi, t). this is why the very point (~zi, t) is called a

bifurcation point of the system (17).

next, we will nd a simple way to search for the dierent directions of all branch curves

at the bifurcation point. assume that the bifurcation point (~zi, t) has been found from

eqs. (17) and (22). we know that, at the bifurcation point (~zi, t), the rank of the jacobian

matrix [ 

x ] is smaller than 3. first, we suppose the rank of the jacobian matrix [ 

x ] is 2
(the case of a more smaller rank will be discussed later). suppose that the 2  2 submatrix
j1( 

x ) is

j1(


x

) =




1
x2

2
x2

1
x3

2
x3

,




(24)

and its determinant d1( 

x ) does not vanish. the implicit function theorem says that there

exist one and only one function relation

8

xi = f i(x1, t),

i = 2, 3

(25)

we denoted the partial derivatives as

f i
1 =

f i
x1 ;

f i

f i
11 =

2f i
x1x1 ;

f i
1t =

2f i

f i
tt =

f i

xtxt

from eqs. (17) and (25) we have for a = 1, 2, 3

a = a(x1, f 2(x1, t), f 3(x1, t), t) = 0

which give

(26)

(27)

(28)

from which we can get the rst order derivatives of f i: f i

with respect to x1 and t respectively we get

(32)

the dierentiation of eq. (28) with respect to x1 gives the same expression as eq. (30). by

making use of the gaussian elimination method to eqs. (30), (30) and (31) we can nd the

second order derivatives f i

11, f i

1t and f i

tt. the above discussion does no matter to the last

9

component 3(~x, t). in order to nd the dierent values of dx1/dt at the bifurcation point

(~zi, t), let us investigate the taylor expansion of 3(~x, t) in the neighborhood of (~zi, t).

substituting eq. (25) into 3(~x, t) we have the function of two variables x1 and t

f (x1, t) = 3(x1, f 2(x1, t), f 3(x1, t), t)

which according to eq. (17) must vanish at the bifurcation point

f (z1

i , t) = 0.

from eq. (33) we have the rst order partial derivatives of f (x1, t)

using eqs. (27) and (28) the rst equation of (22) is expressed as

d(

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

which by cramers rule can be written as

d(


x

)|(~zi,t) =

f
x1 det j1(


x

)|((~zi,t) = 0

since det j1( 

x )|(~zi,t) 6= 0, the above equation gives

with the same reasons, we have

f

f

(40)

(41)

(42)

then taking notice of eqs. ( 34), (37), (38) and (42) the taylor expansion of f (x1, t) in the

neighborhood of the bifurcation point (~zi, t) can be expressed as

f (x1, t) =

1
2

a(x1  z1

i )2 + b(x1  z1

i )(t  t) +

1
2

c(t  t)2

(43)

which by eq. (33) is the expression of 3(~x, t) in the neighborhood of (~zi, t). the expression

(43) is reasonable, which shows that at the bifurcation point (~zi, t) one of eqs.

(17),

3(~x, t) = 0, is satised, i.e.

a(x1  z1

i )2 + 2b(x1  z1

i )(t  t) + c(t  t)2 = 0.

(44)

dividing eq. (44) by (t  t)2 and taking the limit t  t as well as x1  z1
we get

i respectively

in the same way we have

a(

dx1
dt

)2 + 2b

dx1
dt

+ c = 0.

c(

dt
dx1 )2 + 2b

dt
dx1 + a = 0.

(45)

(46)

where a, b and c are three constants. the solutions of eq. (45) or eq. (46) give dierent

directions of the branch curves (worldlines of point defects) at the bifurcation point. there

are four possible cases, which will show the physical meanings of the bifurcation points.

case 1 (a 6= 0): for  = 4(b2  ac) > 0 from eq. (45) we get two dierent directions

of the velocity eld of point defects

11

dx1

dt |1,2= b  b2  ac

a

,

(47)

where two worldlines of two point defects intersect with dierent directions at the bifurcation

point. this shows that two point defects encounter and then depart at the bifurcation point.
case 2 (a 6= 0): for  = 4(b2  ac) = 0 from eq. (45) we get only one direction of

the velocity eld of point defects

dx1
dt |1,2= 

b
a

.

(48)

which includes three important cases. (a) two worldlines tangentially contact, i.e. two

point defects tangentially encounter at the bifurcation point. (b) two worldlines merge into

one worldline, i.e. two point defects merge into one point defect at the bifurcation point. (c)

one worldline resolves into two worldlines, i.e. one point defect splits into two point defects

at the bifurcation point.

case 3 (a = 0, c 6= 0): for  = 4(b2  ac) = 0 from eq. (46) we have

dt

dx1 |1,2= b  b2  ac

c

= 0, 

2b
c

.

(49)

there are two important cases: (a) one worldline resolves into three worldlines, i.e. one

point defect splits into three point defects at the bifurcation point. (b) three worldlines

merge into one worldline, i.e. three point defects merge into one point defect at the bifur-

cation point.

case 4 (a = c = 0): eq. (45) and eq. (46) gives respectively

dx1
dt

= 0,

dt
dx1 = 0.

(50)

this case is obvious similar to case 3.

the above solutions reveal the evolution of the point defects. besides the encountering

of the point defects, i.e. two point defects encounter and then depart at the bifurcation

point along dierent branch curves, it also includes spliting and merging of point defects.

when a multicharged point defect moves through the bifurcation point, it may split into

12

several point defects along dierent branch curves. on the contrary, several point defects

can merge into one point defect at the bifurcation point. the identical conversation of the

topological charge shows the sum of the topological charge of nal point defect(s) must be

equal to that of the initial point defect(s) at the bifurcation point, i.e.,

xf

lf lf = xi

lili

(51)

for xed l. furthermore, from above studies, we see that the generation, annihilation and

bifurcation of point defects are not gradual changes, but start at a critical value of arguments,

i.e. a sudden change.

c. the branch process at a higher degenerated point

in above subsection, we have studied the case that the rank of the jacobian matrix [ 
x ]
of eqs. (17) is 2 = 3  1. in this subsection, we consider the case that the rank of the
jacobian matrix is 1 = 3  2. let the j2( 
x1 and suppose that det j2 6= 0. with the
same reasons of obtaining eq. (25), we can have the function relations

x ) = 1

x3 = f 3(x1, x2, t)

.

(52)

substituting relations (52) into the last two equations of (17), we have following two equa-

tions with three arguments x1, x2, t

f1(x1, x2, t) = 2(x1, x2, f 3(x1, x2, t), t) = 0

f2(x1, x2, t) = 3(x1, x2, f 3(x1, x2, t), t) = 0.

(53)




calculating the partial derivatives of the function f1 and f2 with respect to x1, x2 and t,

taking notice of eq. (52) and using six similar expressions to eqs. (37) and (38), i.e.

fj
x1 |(~zi,t)= 0,

fj
x2 |(~zi,t)= 0,

fj
t

|(~zi,t)= 0,

j = 1, 2,

(54)

we have the following forms of taylor expressions of f1 and f2 in the neighborhood of (~zi, t)

fj(x1, x2, t)  aj1(x1  z1

i )2 + aj2(x1  z1

i )(x2  z2

i ) + aj3(x1  z1
i )

13

(t  t) + aj4(x2  z2

i )2 + aj5(x2  z2

i )(t  t) + aj6(t  t)2 = 0

j = 1, 2.

(55)

in case of aj1 6= 0 and aj4 6= 0, dividing eq. (55) by (t  t)2 and taking the limit t  t,
we obtain two quadratic equations of dx1

dt and dx2

therefore we get dierent directions of the worldlines of point defects at the higher degen-

erated point bifurcation point. the number of dierent branch curves is at most four.

at the end of this section, we conclude that in our theory of point defects there exist the

crucial case of branch process [11]. besides the encountering of the point defects, i.e. two

point defects encounter and then depart at the bifurcation point along dierent worldlines,

it also includes spliting and merging of point defects. when a multicharged point defect

moves through the bifurcation point, it may split into several point defects along dierent

worldlines. on the contrary, several point defects can merge into one point defect at the

bifurcation point. since the topological charges of point defects is identically conserved (4),

the sum of the topological charge of nal point defect(s) must be equal to that of the initial

point defect(s) at the bifurcation point.

iv. conclusions

we have studied the evolution of the point defects of a three dimensional vector order

parameter by making use of the  mapping topological current theory. we conclude that

there exist crucial cases of branch processes in the evolution of the point defects. this means

that the point defects generate or annihilate at the limit points and encounter, split or merge

at the bifurcation points of the three dimensional vector order parameter, which shows that

the point defects system is unstable at these branch points. there are two restrictions of the

evolution of point defects in this paper. one restriction is the conservation of the topological

charge of the point defects during the branch process, the other restriction is the number

of dierent directions of the worldlines of point defects is at most four at the bifurcation

points. at last, we would like to point out that all the results in this paper are obtained

from the viewpoint of topology without using any particular models or hypothesis.
