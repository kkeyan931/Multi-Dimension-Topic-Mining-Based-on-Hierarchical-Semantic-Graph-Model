abstract

it is often stated in the literature concerning d = 4, 6 compact type iib ori-

entifolds that tadpole cancellation conditions i) uniquely x the gauge group

(up to wilson lines and/or moving of branes) and ii) are equivalent to gauge

anomaly cancellation. we study the relationship between tadpole and anomaly

cancellation conditions and qualify both statements. in general the tadpole

cancellation conditions imply gauge anomaly cancellation but are stronger than

the latter conditions in d = 4, n = 1 orientifolds. we also nd that tadpole

cancellation conditions in zn d = 4, 6 compact orientifolds do not completely
x the gauge group and we provide new solutions dierent from those previ-

ously reported in the literature.

1 introduction

it is a well known fact that anomaly cancellation in so(32) type i string may be

understood as a direct consequence of the cancellation of tadpoles of ramond-ramond

elds. in fact the implication runs in both directions and anomaly cancellation implies

also tadpole cancellation. this is not so surprising since in d = 10 the anomaly

cancellation constraints x almost uniquely the massless particle content of the theory.

in type i vacua in lower dimensions, like in type iib d = 4, 6 orientifolds, tadpole

cancellation constraints do also imply anomaly cancellation. an interesting question

arises regarding the extent up to which anomaly cancellation and tadpole cancellation

are still equivalent in lower dimensions. one of the purposes of this paper is to ad-

dress this question. we concentrate in the study of d = 4, n = 1 type iib compact

orientifolds, although analogous results are obtained in d = 6. we nd that tadpole

cancellation is in general a more stringent constraint than anomaly cancellation in the

case of d = 4 orientifolds. in order to show this, we rewrite the anomaly cancella-

tion conditions in terms of traces of chan-paton twist matrices acting on 9-branes

and/or 5-branes. in this way, it is shown that in general only a subset of the complete

tadpole cancellation conditions is recovered. thus, there are certain tadpole cancel-

lation constraints which are actually not required for anomaly cancellation. which

those are depends on the structure of the twist group of the orientifold and also on the
simultaneous presence or not of 9-branes and 5-branes1

this procedure allows a broad scan for solutions of tadpole cancellation conditions

in d = 4, 6 n = 1, type iib orientifolds. in particular, we nd that there are certain

d = 4 and d = 6 orientifolds which admit many more solutions than previously

reported in the literature.

the relationship between tadpole cancellation and anomaly cancellation was con-
sidered in ref.[2] 2 in the context of d = 4, n = 1 gauge theories on the world-volume of
d3-branes sitting at zn  zm singularities 3. in that reference an equivalence between
tadpole and anomaly cancellation conditions was found. those models dier from the

class we consider in several important respects. in particular they are non-compact

models (the six dimensions transverse to the d3-branes are not compactied) and in
1we are referring here to chiral d = 4 orientifolds. non-chiral ones like the z2 z2 model of ref.[1]

obviously do not get any constraint from anomaly cancellation.

2see also [3, 4, 5] for analogous results in six-dimensional orientifolds.
3n = 1 supersymmetric theories form d3 branes at orbifold singularities have been studied in

[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. the inclusion of orientifold projections has been discussed in [11, 12, 13, 14].

1

addition they only contain d3-branes.

in this paper we consider compact orientifolds and this fact makes the following

important dierence. tadpoles are sources for the rr potentials of the theory.

in

non-compact models some of the twisted rr elds can propagate on non-compact

directions and carry the rr-ux o to innity. the models are consistent without

imposing cancellation of the corresponding twisted tadpoles. in the compact models

we are to consider, the rr-ux cannot escape to innity but is trapped in the compact

space. thus additional constraints may appear.

a second dierence is that we consider the simultaneous presence of two types of

d-branes, 9-branes and 5-branes. this is equivalent by t-duality to considering both

3-branes and 7-branes in the context of [2]. however, in this reference the emphasis

is in the gauge theory on the world-volume of the d3-branes, while the d7-branes

are considered non-dynamical. this is justied since the d7-branes have more non-

compact dimensions than the d3-branes. in our compact models, however, d7 branes

wrap compact direction and yield truly four-dimensional elds. thus the cancellation

of anomalies from gauge groups living on the d7-branes lead to additional constraints,

not present in the non-compact models. the considerations in this and the preceding

paragraph explain the dierence between our conclusions and those for non-compact

models in [2].

the outline of the paper is as follows. in the next section we review some facts

about compact d = 4, n = 1 type iib orientifolds and establish the notation needed

for the remaining sections. in section 3.1 we study the compact orientifolds without
even order generators i.e., z3, z7 and z3  z3 orientifolds. in this case the models
have only d9-branes and tadpole conditions uniquely x the gauge group. however
in the z3  z3 case it is shown how tadpole cancellation conditions are stronger than
anomaly cancellation conditions. in section 3.2 we study the compact orientifolds with

even order twists. in this case both d9-branes and d5-branes are present. the z4, z8,
z8 and z12 orientifolds with standard orientifold projection are shown to be necessarily
anomalous, in agreement with the results of ref. [18] in which they were shown to have

non-vanishing tadpoles. we present other examples (the z12 orientifold) in which
tadpole conditions are explicitly shown to be stronger than anomaly cancellation ones.

new solutions for the tadpole conditions are shown for the z6 and z12 orientifolds
leading to a variety of gauge groups previously overlooked in the literature. we study

the cancellation of u(1) anomalies in section 4. we nd that cancellation of non-

abelian anomalies guarantees the cancellation of abelian anomalies. in addition it is

2

shown that in the d = 4 compact orientifold case cancellation of non-abelian anomalies

also implies the cancellation of mixed u(1)-gravitational anomalies. section 5 is left for

some nal comments and conclusions. in particular we compare our results to those

found for non-compact orientifolds and discuss the origin of the non-equivalence of

tadpole/anomaly conditions. we also briey discuss the equivalent results for d = 6,

n = 1 compact iib orientifolds.

2 d = 4, n = 1, type iib orientifolds

in this section we summarize the basic ingredients [15, 16, 17, 18] and notation needed

in the construction of d = 4, n = 1 orientifold. the reader is referred to [18] for

further details.

in a type iib orientifold, the toroidally compactied theory is divided out by the
joint action of a discrete symmetry group g1, (like zn or zn  zm ) together with
a world sheet parity operation , exchanging left and right movers.  action can be

accompanied by extra operations thus leading to generic orientifold group g1 + g2
with hh  g1 for h, h  g2

in this article we will refer to the cases g1 = g2 and g1 = zn or g1 = zn zm and
such that d = 4 n = 1 theories are obtained, when the twist  is performed on type
iib compactied on t 6/g1. the allowed orbifold groups, acting crystalographically on
t 6 leading to n = 1 unbroken supersymmetry were classied in [19]. the list, with

corresponding twist vector eigenvalues v = (v1, v2, v3) associated to the zn orbifold
twist  is given in table 1.

table 1: zn actions in d=4.

orientifolding closed type iib string introduces a klein-bottle unoriented world-

sheet. amplitudes on such a surface contain tadpole divergences. in order to eliminate

such unphysical divergences dp-branes must be generically introduced. in this way,

divergences occurring in the open string sector cancel up the closed sector ones and

produce a consistent theory. tadpole cancellation is interpreted as cancellation of

3

the charge carried by rr form potentials. for zn , with n odd, only d9-branes are
required. they ll the full space-time and six dimensional compact space. for n even,
d5k-branes, with world-volume lling space-time and the kth complex plane, may be
required. this is so whenever the orientifold group contains the element rirj, for
k 6= i, j. here ri (rj) is an order two twist of the ith (jth) complex plane.

in what follows we consider cases with only one set of ve branes. zn twists in
table 1 were organized in such a way that, for even n, the order two element r = n/2

inverts the complex planes y1 and y2 and thus the corresponding orientifolds have
d53-branes, lling space-time and compact dimension y3.

open string states are denoted by |, abi, where  refers to world-sheet degrees of
freedom while the a, b chan-paton indices are associated to the open string endpoints

lying on dp-branes and dq-branes respectively.

these chan-paton labels must be contracted with a hermitian matrix pq

ab. the
action of an element of the orientifold group on chan-paton factors is achieved by a
unitary matrix g,p such that g : pg  g,ppq1
g,q . we denote by k,p the matrix
associated to the zn orbifold twist k acting on a dp-brane.

consistency under group transformations imposes restrictions on the representa-

tions g. for instance, from 2 = 1 it follows that

,p = t

,p

(2.1)

tadpole cancellation imposes further constraints on g. since we are planning
to compare such restrictions with those coming from anomaly cancellation of gauge

theories on d5 and d9-brane congurations, we will not impose the former in what

follows, but just consider generic actions obeying the algebraic consistency conditions.

nevertheless, we will perform a denite choice of signs in (2.1), namely

,9 = t
,9
,5 = t

,5

(2.2)

for  acting on 9 and on 5-branes. the rst condition is the usual requirement of

global consistency of the ten form potential in type i theory. second equation is in

agreement with the gimon and polchinski action, analyzed in [17]. these constraints

lead to so(2n9) and usp(2n5) groups in the 99 and 55 open string sectors respectively,
where 2n9 (2n5) is the number of d9(5)-branes (an even number is required by  action
we will consider). when n9 = n5 = 16 such conditions ensure cancellation of untwisted
tadpoles. notice that consistency under the action of (k)2 = 2k and (2.2) lead to

thus, for a zn orbifold twist action, with n = 2p (n = 2p + 1) for n even (odd),

a generic matrix ,p can be written as

then (2.2) and (2.3) are satised. in what follows we will be mainly concerned with
actions without vector structure  whenever d5-branes are present 5. in those cases,

the chan-paton matrices for the orbifold twist break the symplectic factors down to

unitary groups.

for later convenience note that the trace of twist matrix above, or in general of its

k-th power k,p, reads

tr k,p =

(2.7)

where the sum starts from 0(1) for the with (without) vector structure actions. in

particular, for k = 0 we obtain t rip = p 2np

moreover, in order to compare anomaly cancellation conditions, usually given in
terms of the integers np
j , with tadpole equations, usually written in terms of above
traces, it is also useful to have the former expressed in terms of the latter. this

j = 2np, the number of dp-branes.

is easily achieved by performing a discrete fourier transformation. for instance, for

the without vector structure case, by multiplying both sides of equation (2.7) by
cos(2kvj) and by summing over k = 0, . . . , n  1 and using that tr nk,p = tr k,p,
we obtain

the spectrum associated to the 9 and 5-brane orientifold conguration is easily

obtained by working in a cartan-weyl basis (see [18]).

the gauge elds living on the world-volume of a dp-brane have associated chan-
paton factors p corresponding to the gauge group gp with g9 = so(2n9) and g5 =
sp(2n5). in cartan-weyl basis such generators are organized into charged generators
a = ea, a = 1,   , dim gp  rank gp, and cartan algebra generators i = hi,
i = 1,   , rank gp, such that

[hi, ea] = a

i ea

(2.10)

where the (rank gp)-dimensional vector with components a
the generator ea.

i is the root associated to

the matrices 1,p and its powers represent the action of the zn group on chan-
paton factors, and they correspond to elements of a discrete subgroup of the abelian

group spanned by the cartan generators. hence, we can write

1,p = e2iv ph

(2.11)

thus, this equation denes a (rank gp)-dimensional vector v p with coordinates
corresponding to the vjs dened in (2.5) above. cartan generators are represented
as tensor products of 3 pauli matrices. in such a description the massless states are
easily found. let us consider the case in which all 5-branes sit at the origin. in the pp

sector the gauge group is obtained by selecting the root vectors satisfying

while matter states correspond to charged generators with

a  v p = 0 mod z

a  v p = vi mod z

(2.12)

(2.13)

recall that root vectors for orthogonal groups are of the form (1,1, 0,   , 0)
where underlining indicates that all possible permutations must be considered. in the
symplectic case we have to include, in addition, the long roots (2, 0,   , 0).

in the 95 sector the subset of roots of g9  g5 of the form

3.1 odd order orientifolds

in this subsection we center on the study of d = 4 n = 1 zn orientifolds, with odd n.
these models are consistent without the introduction of d5-branes, so only d9-branes
are included. the only compact odd order orientifolds correspond to z3, z7 and z3z3
with vector twists given in table 1. however, let us momentarily be more general and

consider also zn orbifold actions which are not necessarily crystallographic. thus, we
focus on twist generators  with eigenvalues 1
a=1 ta = 0 mod n, and

n = 2p + 1.

the strategy to study the relation between the anomaly and tadpole cancellation

conditions will be as follows. first we compute the gauge group and massless matter for

a general such model. in this step only algebraic consistency conditions (group law) are

imposed on the chan-paton matrices. next we nd generic conditions for cancellation
of gauge anomalies 6. since for su(n) groups only fundamental n and/or antisym-

metric an representations (or their conjugates) appear, such conditions will manifest
as restriction on the group ranks in order to ensure that only anomaly-free combina-

tions are allowed. finally, these restrictions are compared with tadpole cancellation

equations obtained from type iib orientifolds.

in agreement with eq.(2.5), the generic action of the orbifold twist on 9-branes can

be encoded in the matrix

1,9 = (1,9, 1,9)

(3.1)

6notice that when one of the gauge factors is absent, the conditions of anomaly cancellation may

be less restrictive than those we consider [2]. however, this case is rather particular, and we nd it is

more insightful to consider generic cancellation of anomalies, as we do in the present paper.

notice that even if t r0,9 appears in (3.9), it is not present in these conditions,
there is no dependence on the total number of 9-branes. this was expected, given the

relation of these gauge theories to systems of d3 branes at non-compact singularities,

to be discussed below.

for the compact z3 and z7 cases these are the well known twisted tadpole cancel-
lation conditions t r1,9 = 4 and t r2 = 4 respectively [21, 22, 18] . such conditions
on the traces or, equivalently, equations (3.8), completely x the values of ujs, and
thus lead to the unique solutions found in the literature, when the number of 9-branes

is 32.

in order to interpret several results in this paper, it will be useful to relate our

models to systems of d3 branes at orientifold singularities [11, 12, 13, 14]. the basic

observation is that the gauge theory we have described in the case at hand can be re-

alized by placing d3 branes at a non-compact zn orientifold singularity [14]. this can
be understood by t-dualizing along the three compact directions, which transforms the

d9-branes into d3-branes sitting at one of the xed points, and then taking a decom-

pactication limit. thus, the conditions (3.12) ensure the cancellation of anomalies on

the d3 brane world-volume. this explains why tr 0 (which in this case is the total
number of d3 branes) is unconstrained: there is an innite family of non-anomalous

theories, parametrized by the number of d3 branes at the singularity. actually, in

9

the non-compact case, the conditions above are exactly equivalent to the tadpole can-

cellation conditions, in analogy with the result in [2]. we have just seen that in the

particular case of zn (n odd) orientifolds, compact models also have this property.

the same conclusion, however, does not follow for other types of orientifold, as we
show below. to this end, let us consider for instance orientifolds zn1  zn2, with n1,
n2 odd. as in the above models, these theories are consistent without the addition
of d5-branes. the analysis of the relation between anomaly cancellation and tadpole

cancellation conditions can be studied following the strategy used above, so we will be

more sketchy, leaving the details for specic examples. the rst step is to compute
the spectrum on the d9-brane sector for a general zn1  zn2 model, and compute its
non-abelian anomalies in terms of the ranks of the group factors. then we perform a

discrete fourier transform to rewrite them in terms of chan-paton matrices associated
to the twists 1
n (t1, t2, t3) in the orientifold group. the resulting anomaly cancellation
conditions have exactly the form (3.12) (it must be understood that the matrix  in

(3.12) will correspond to a product of powers of  and  associated to the particular
twist 1

n (t1, t2, t3), where  and  are the zn1, zn2 generators, respectively).

the fact that we obtain the same expression for zn and zn1  zn2 orientifolds
(with odd n, n1, n2) is related to the fact that the twists in a zn1  zn2 orientifold
and in zn orientifolds have the same structure (namely, no order two twist is contained
in the group).

 and  described by the eigenvalues 1

in particular the expression (3.12) holds for the compact z3  z3 orientifold with
3 (0, 1,1). it is important to
observe that the rst coecient in (3.12) vanishes when one direction is not aected

3(1,1, 0) and 1

by the twist. therefore, for the case under consideration, only one constraint corre-
sponding to the twist 2 with eigenvalues 1
3 (1, 1,2), thus aecting all three complex
directions, is found. it reads

hence, we nd that anomaly cancellation is much less restrictive, in this case, than

tadpole cancellation, which also requires [22, 23] the set of equations

t r2 = 4

(3.13)

tr  = tr  = tr  = 8

(3.14)

associated to the other twists, to be satised. imposing these additional conditions,
the spectrum of the model is completely xed. thus, even if a whole set of z3  z3
anomaly free models satisfying (3.13) can be constructed, there is, however, a unique

solution satisfying all tadpole cancellation conditions.

10

let us consider this case in more detail. twists  and  are represented by the

matrices

with  = e2i/3.

 = diag (iw0, iu1, iu2, iu3, iu4)

 = diag (iw0, iu1, iu2, iu3, 2iu4)

(3.15)

the gauge group is so(2w0)  u(u1) . . . u(u4) and the massless spectrum can be

easily computed to be

a2 + (u1, u3) + (u1, u4) + (u3, u4) + (2w0, u2)

a4 + (u1, u3) + (u1, u2) + (u2, u3) + (2w0, u4)

(3.16)

a1 + (u2, u4) + (u3, u4) + (u2, u3) + (2w0, u1)

if we only impose the anomaly cancellation condition

tr 2 = 2(w0 + u3)  u1  u2  u4 = 4

(3.17)

many anomaly-free spectra can be obtained. indeed, as discussed above, these models
can be related to systems of d3-branes at z3  z3 singularities. for these non-compact
constructions, all these models are consistent. in the non-compact case the reason why

the tadpole conditions (3.14) need not be imposed is clear [2]. those conditions corre-

spond to twists which leave one complex plane unrotated. thus the rr ux can escape

to innity through those planes and one does not need to impose the corresponding

tadpole cancellation. in the compact case this is dierent: even though those planes

are unrotated they are compact and the rr charge is trapped. thus the twisted rr

charge corresponding to those twists has to be canceled and the conditions (3.14) have

to be imposed. however, although these conditions are needed for consistency, they

are totally disconnected from the issue of gauge anomaly cancellation.

3.2 even order orientifolds

for orientifolds including even order twists, there will be in general both d9-branes

and d5-branes present. in this section we consider the construction of d = 4, n = 1

models obtained from orientifold congurations of d9 and d5-branes.

as in the previous section, we rst consider a general (not necessarily crystallo-

graphic) orbifold twist. in a rst step we compute the gauge group and massless spec-

trum of such models for an arbitrary number of 2n9 (2n5) d9(d5)-branes. generic con-
ditions for cancellation of gauge anomalies are then found. using the discrete fourier

11

transform, these restrictions are then compared with tadpole cancellation equations

obtained from type iib orientifolds. finally, explicit solutions to these equations are

discussed. in some cases new solutions, other than those reported in the literature are

found. for simplicity we concentrate on models with only one set of d5-branes, all of

them sitting at the xed point at the origin. other situations are considered through

specic examples.

let us consider arbitrary zn (n = 2p ) twists with eigenvalues given by 1

n (t1, t2, t3)

with t1 + t2 + t3 = 0 and t3 an even integer (thus t1, t2 are odd).

we concentrate on models without vector structure. thus, from eq. (2.5) we have

 = diag (in1,   , (2j1)inj ,   , (2p 1)inp )
with  = ei/n and where we have dropped the upperindex 5 (n5

j = nj).

(3.18)

a similar structure is used in the 9-brane sector just by replacing the integers njs

by ujs. these matrices correspond to the shifts

v p =

2n

(1,   1,   , 2j  1,   , 2j  1,   , 2p  1,   , 2p  1)

(3.19)

with nj(uj) entries (2j  1) for p = 5(9), with j = 1,   , p .

the resulting gauge group is

the massless states in 55 sector are

representations do appear for ta odd, i.e. a = 1, 2 for our convention above.
sector we have dened t = t1+t2

, see (2.15). the spectrum in 99-sector can be obtained

in 59

2

from eq.(3.21) by replacing ns by us.

again, it is straightforward to write down a general condition for the cancellation

of non-abelian anomalies. it reads

j+1 = nj+n are understood.
as in the odd twist case, such equivalences are automatically implemented when njs
(ujs) are expressed in terms of traces through ec.(2.8). in fact, by using such equation
above we nd that, in order to ensure the absence of gauge anomalies for the 55 group

sector we must have

(3.25)

where we have emphasized, by adding a 0 subscript, that d5-branes are located at the

origin. again  functions appear from the contribution of antisymmetric representa-
tions. notice that the sum is actually up to p  1 (and not up to p ). this is due to
the fact that, from our denition (3.18) of the twist matrix , in the case without vector

structure ,

t rp,p = 0

(3.26)

this equation for the order two twist matrix, which in this case is automatically

satised by construction, appears in [18] (eq.(2.39)) as necessary condition for the

cancellation of tadpoles

again, it will be useful to keep in mind that these gauge theories can be realized on

the world-volume of d3-branes at zn orientifold singularities. in this case, d7-branes
are also present in the conguration. in this non-compact context, it is possible to show

that the anomaly cancellation conditions (3.24) are exactly equivalent to the tadpole

cancellation conditions. in the following we show that this property is in general no

longer true in the compact models.

13

the constraints that we have just obtained may be read as a set of p equations (for
each value of j) with p  1 unknowns sin( t3k
n )ak. thus, the system is, in principle,
overdetermined and it could have no solutions at all, unless not all equations are really

independent. in fact, we will see that some models are not consistent.

recall that a similar set of equations, obtained from above simply by exchanging k,9
and k,5 would be required in order to avoid gauge anomalies in the 99 sector groups.
this 5  9 symmetry is due to the fact that all vebranes have been put at the origin,
and it is a manifestation of t (self) duality. nevertheless we will see that despite the

symmetry of anomaly equations, in some cases they allow for solutions which are not
symmetric under the exchange 5  9. the additional tadpole cancellation equation
leads to a fully t duality invariant spectrum.

the above constraints are valid for an arbitrary, not necessarily chrystalographic,

even twist action on 5 and 9-branes. in what follows we analyze the compact cases

shown in table 1. the global constraint t r0,9 = t r0,5 = 32 must be imposed in such
cases.

i) non consistent models
for orbifold groups containing a twist with eigenvalues 1

4 (1, 1,2), namely the
orbifold actions z4, z8, z8 and z12 the above equations have no solutions. in fact,
these orientifolds were found in [18] to be ill-dened. diculties stem from the presence

of a klein-bottle tadpole proportional to the volume v3 of the third compact dimension.
interestingly enough, such inconsistencies are recovered here from the point of view

of anomaly cancellation. this can be easily seen in the z4 case. in fact, (3.24) leads
2
to the incompatible equations
2 a1 = 8 for j = 2 where

2
2 a1 = 8 for j = 1 and

a1 = 2t r1,5,0 + t r1,9. the same situation repeats in the other cases.

we should emphasize that the above comments for inconsistency refer only to chan-

paton twists without vector structure.

it is in principle possible to nd consistent

d = 4, n = 1 orientifolds corresponding to these twists but with cp twists with

vector structure. indeed we have found consistent (non-chiral) examples based on z4
with vector structure.

ii) consistent models

for all other twists in table 1 it is possible to write down a general, consistent,

solution to eq. (3.24). namely

14

sin(

t3k
n

)ak = 4(1 + (1)k)[sin(

t1k
n

) + sin(

t2k
n

)]

(3.27)

with k = 1, . . . p . thus, for each twist k of order k we obtain a condition which

relates tr k,5 and tr k,9 as they show up in tadpole cancellation equations. whenever
k is such that k twist leaves the direction parallel to the d5-brane untouched, then
sin( t3k
n ) = 0) and no constraint is present for the

n ) + sin( t2k

n ) = 0 (thus also sin( t1k
corresponding tr k,9 and tr k,5.

on the other hand, since we must have a similar solution for anomaly cancellation

in 99 sector groups but with 5  9 in (3.25), we will have

[4 sin(

) sin(

t1k
n

)  1](tr k,5,0  tr k,9) = 0
for all other twists with t3k 6= 0 mod n. notice that 4 sin( t1k
n ) is, by the
lefschetz xed point theorem, nothing but the number of xed points of twist k in

n ) sin( t2k

(3.28)

t2k
n

the complex directions (y1, y2). thus, this equation implies that whenever points other
than the origin are kept xed then tr k,5,0 = tr k,9. also notice that only even values
of k could lead to non zero values for ak.

let us consider the dierent cases in more detail:

z6:

from eq.(3.27) we nd a1 = 0 and a2 = 16, namely

tr 1,9 + tr 1,5,0 = 0

tr 2,9 + 3tr 2,5,0 = 16

(3.29)

these are tadpole cancellation conditions found in [22, 18]. however, in reference [18] it

is found that tadpole cancellation at other xed points, other than the origin, imposes

an extra requirement. namely

tr 2,9 + 3tr 2,5,j = 4

(3.30)

with j = 1,   , 8 denoting the xed points of 2 in the (y1, y2) planes, other than the
origin, where 5-branes may sit. since here all branes are at the origin then tr 2,5,j = 0.
we are led to

tr 2,9 = 4

(3.31)

this is precisely the extra condition (3.28) that results when anomaly cancellation for

the 99 sector groups is required.

15

thus, we learn that for the z6 orientifold, generic absence of anomalies and of
tadpole divergences are equivalent. let us stress that to arrive at this conclusion,

analysis of tadpole cancellation at all xed points (and not only at the origin) is needed.

in fact, it is equation (3.31) which makes tadpole equations to look symmetric under

the exchange of 9 and 5-branes (all at the origin) and thus ensures cancellation of

99 sector anomalies.

it appears to us that this point is not suciently clear in the

literature. sometimes tadpole equations asymmetric between d9 and d5-branes are

written down for four- or six-dimensional orientifolds. these are misleading since, as

they stand, they would allow for 5-9 asymmetric solutions which could be anomalous.

taking into account tadpole cancellations in xed points away from the origin does in

fact impose d9-d5 symmetric solutions. this is just the right behaviour, given the

fact that putting all 5-branes at the origin is a selfdual conguration under t-duality.

let us now look for solutions of the above equations. an interesting feature is that

the rst row in (3.29) indicates the possibility of a local cancellation among 9-branes

and 5-branes rr charges that may not vanish independently. this possibility has not

been noticed in the literature, and we will exploit it here to construct new solutions

of the tadpole equations for all 5-branes at origin. the new possibilities, as we saw in

eq.(3.28), have to do with the fact that only the origin is xed under z6 twist.

in order to study the solutions it is easier to rewrite the traces in terms of njs and

ujs. hence, by using (2.7) we have

1
3

tr 1,5 = n1  n3
tr 2,5 = n1  2n2 + n3

(3.32)

and similar equations for tr k,9 in terms of ujs. replacing (3.29)-(3.31) and using
that there are 32 d5- and d9-branes we obtain

u1 = 12  n1
u2 = n2 = 4

u3 = n1

(3.33)

therefore, from (3.20), the gauge groups, depending on the free integer parameter
n1  12, are

[u(n1)  u(4)  u(12  n1)]55  [u(12  n1)  u(4)  u(n1)]99

(3.34)

16

the matter content may easily be obtained from (3.21) and (3.22) . notice that the

solution given in [22, 18] has n1 = n3 = 6 implying that tr 1,5 = tr 1,9 = 0. therefore
it corresponds to the case in which 5 and 9 brane contributions cancel independently.

z6:

absence of anomalies in the 55 sector leads to

tr 1,9  2tr 1,5,0 = 0
tr 2,9 = 8

(3.35)

which again coincide with equations for tadpole cancellation at the origin. when

the anomaly cancellation conditions from the 99 sector are included the full set of

constraints

tr 1,9 = tr 1,5 = 0
tr 2,9 = tr 2,5 = 8

(3.36)

is obtained. it is completely equivalent to cancellation of all twisted tadpoles, including

those at the other three xed points in the transverse directions.

one aspect of this model may appear puzzling. since the order three twist leaves
one complex plane unrotated, one would expect, as it happened in the z3z3 case, that
the tadpole constraint for 2,9 is not required for anomaly cancellation. it turns out
that the presence of d5-branes makes things dierent. indeed, cancellation of gauge

anomalies for 99 sector groups requires eq.(3.27) but with 9 and 5 indices exchanged

in (3.25). explicitly,

ak = 4 sin(

k
6

) sin(3k

6

)tr k,9 + tr k,5

(3.37)

and thus, in eect, no constraint on tr k,9 is found for k = 2. nevertheless tr 2,5 =
8 is still required. the condition on tr 2,9 is really obtained from the 55 sector
consistency. a further discussion on this point is presented in section 5.

unlike z6, in this case charges among 9-branes and 5-branes must cancel indepen-
dently. this is due, essentially, to the presence of extra xed points. as in the odd

orientifold cases, since now the number of conditions on the traces and the number

of unknowns are the same, the solution presented in [23, 18] (for all 5-branes at the

origin) is unique.

it is instructive to analyze, from the point of view of anomaly cancellation, the

situation when part of the 32 d5-branes live at other xed points. as an example

17

consider the case when ve branes are distributed in groups of n 5

l branes among the
four xed points l = 0, . . . , 3 of the  twist in the rst two planes. the structure of

the 55l gauge group and matter content at point l is exactly the same as that for
the origin considered above. the spectrum at each point is obtained from (3.21) and
3 ) = 16. thus

l=0(nl

2 + nl

1 + nl

the anomaly constraints eq.(3.35) must now be imposed at each point. namely

(3.22) just by replacing n  nl, with the condition p3
tr 1,9  2tr 1,5,l = 0
tr 2,9 = 8

(3.38)

for l = 0, . . . , 3.

however, constraints involving several xed points are obtained when the 99 group

is considered. the 59 sector (3.22) reads

3

[(u1, nl

1 ) + (u1, nl

2 ) + (u2, nl

3 ) + (u3, nl

3 ) + (u2, nl

1 )]

xl=0

(3.39)

and so, a sum of contributions from all xed points supporting d5-branes appears.

thus anomaly constraints will read

3

3

xl=0
xl=0

tr 1,5,l  2tr 1,9 = 0

tr 2,5,l = 8

(3.40)

(3.41)

eqs.(3.38) and (3.41) reproduce the tadpole cancellation equations for this general

case. since d5-branes are now distributed among dierent xed points we expect to

be able to achieve charge cancellation in dierent ways rather than in the unique form

found above. for instance, rst row in equations above tells us that now it could still

be possible to achieve charge cancellation among 9 and 5-branes even if they did not

vanish independently. by writing the traces in terms of group ranks (2.7) and recalling
3 = 16 we nd the following consistency

2 + nl

1 + nl

l=0 nl

that u1 + u2 + u3 = 16, p3

constraints

3

1  nl
3 = u1  6 = 2  u3

(3.42)

z12

18

in this example tadpole cancellation appears to be stronger than anomaly cancel-

lation. indeed, anomaly cancellation in the 55 sector gives

ak = tr k,9  tr k,5,0 = 0 ;
a4 = tr 4,9 + 3tr 4,5,0 = 16

k = 1, 2, 5

(3.43)

which must be supplemented with the extra, independent, constraint from the equiva-

lent equations in the 99 sector,

tr 4,9 = tr 4,5,0 = 4

(3.44)

notice, however, that there is no constraint for a3 = tr 3,9 + 2tr 3,5,0 , due to the
12 ) (for k = 3) associated to the fourth order

appearance of the vanishing factor sin( 4k
twist 1

4(1,1, 0) which leaves the third plane invariant.

thus, we expect the model will have additional tadpole conditions, not needed to

ensure anomaly cancellation. this additional constraint is the tadpole condition (2.45)

of [18]

tr 3,9 + 2tr 3,5,l = 0,

(3.45)

where l refers to the xed points of 3 in the rst and second complex coordinates. in

our specic case with all d5 branes at the origin, the condition reads

tr 3,9 = tr 3,5,0 = 0

(3.46)

these equations constrain the model beyond mere anomaly cancellation. this resem-
bles much what happened with z3  z3.

again, due to the fact that only the origin is xed under z12 there are more solutions

to the tadpole equations than those in the literature.

let us be more explicit. the generic gauge group is q6

massless spectra is given by (3.21-3.22)

i=1 u(ni) while the 55+59

a1 + a6 + (n1, n2) + (n2, n3) + (n3, n4) + (n4, n5) + (n5, n6)

a3 + a4 + (n1, n5) + (n2, n4) + (n2, n6) + (n3, n5) + (n1; n6) +

(n1, n4) + (n2, n3) + (n1, n5) + (n2, n6) + (n3, n6)
(u1; n2) + (u1; n3) + (u2; n4) + (u3; n5) + (u4; n6) + (u5; n6) + u  n

(3.47)

by rewriting the traces above in terms of the group ranks we nd that anomaly

cancellation equations (3.43) constrain such ranks to satisfy

n1  n4 = u1  u4

19

n1 + n3 = u1 + u3

n1 + n2 = u1 + u2

n2 + n5 = u2 + u5 = 4

n1 + n3 + n4 + n6 = u1 + u3 + u4 + u6 = 12

(3.48)

thus we see that all ujs may be expressed in terms of 55 integers, apart from u1,

which is a free integer parameter.

it is interesting to notice that if only eq. (3.43) are used then anomaly free (but

not tadpole-free !) models, which have an asymmetric content in the 55 and 99 sector

are possible.

for instance, a family of models obeying such constraint but not (3.46) is obtained

by choosing

n1 = n4 = n5 = 4
n2 = 0, n3 = k, n6 = 4  k
u1 = u4 = u5 = 0
u2 = 4, u3 = k + 4, u6 = 8  k

(3.49)

(3.50)

(3.51)

(3.52)

with k  4. the corresponding gauge groups are

[u(4)  u(k + 4)  u(8  k)]99  [u(k)  u(4  k)  u(4)3]55

(3.53)

these models are chiral and anomaly free, but are not symmetrical with respect to

the exchange between d9 and d5 branes, and so violate (3.46).

in fact, eq. (3.46) reads n1  n2 + n4 = u1  u2 + u4 = 4 and thus imposes uj = nj

for all j = 1, . . . , 6. with this extra condition the resulting gauge group is now

[u(n1)u(n2)u(n3)u(4+n2n1)u(4n2)u(8n2n3)]55[same]99 (3.54)
symmetric under 5  9. these are the solutions which obey all tadpole cancellation
conditions. for n1 = n3 = 3 and n2 = 2 one recovers the solution given in [18].

4 anomalous u (1)s

it is known that orientifold compactications lead to spectra which usually contain

several abelian factors with non vanishing triangle anomalies. in [14] a generalized
green-schwarz mechanism ensuring cancellation of such terms was found 7. it involves

7see [24, 20, 25] for the analogous mechanism in six dimensions.

20

rr scalars coming from the twisted closed sector of the string. in this section we would

like to indicate how u(1) anomalies actually cancel in the models we have considered

above, whenever generic cancellation of non abelian anomalies is ensured.

4.1 mixed non-abelian anomalies

for concreteness, let us consider the case of even orientifold models. the arguments

below are also valid for odd orientifolds. in this subsection we center on the mixed

anomaly of the u(1) factor in u(ni) in the dp-brane sector with su(nj) non-abelian
group in the dq-brane sector, denoted t pq
ij .

following [14] this triangle anomaly will be canceled if t pq

ij + apq

ij = 0, where apq

the gauge boson) and

c pp

k = 2 sin kv3

(4.2)

in principle, this factorization of u(1) anomalies could lead to new constraints on the

spectrum of the model, beyond those imposed by generic cancellation of non-abelian

anomalies. in the following, we show this is not the case.

sum over k in (4.1) can be performed explicitly. consider the p = q sector. by

using (3.11) and orthogonality of cosines we nd

(4.4)

where arguments of the kronecker  functions are dened mod n. it is straightforward

to check from the spectrum given in (3.21) and (3.22) that this indeed cancels the
triangle anomaly whenever i 6= j.

the i = j case is a little bit more involved due to contributions from antisymmetric

representations. recall that the contribution to the triangle anomaly from the anti-
symmetric aj (2) of su(n) is, in our normalization, 2( n2
2 ). thus, the u(1)j-su(nj)
triangle anomaly reads

21

+ (t1  t2) ] }

(4.5)

the term between curly brackets is nothing but the expression (3.23) for cancellation

of general non-abelian anomalies. since it must vanish the remaining contribution

cancels the expression (4.3) for the case i = j.

this shows that the condition of cancellation of non-abelian anomalies implies the

appropriate factorization of u(1) anomalies. it is also easy to check that cubic u(1)

anomalies are similarly canceled by the gs mechanism without the need of further

constraints.

this behaviour could have been guessed, based on our results in section 3. there

we noticed that the conditions of non-abelian anomaly cancellation are equivalent to

the tadpole cancellation conditions of a system of d3-branes at non-compact orientifold

singularities (possibly in the presence of d7 branes). in this language, the additional

tadpole conditions only arise in compact models, where the rr ux cannot escape

to innity. thus the additional conditions are not required for consistency of the d3

brane system. since the cancellation of u(1) anomalies is required for consistency

even in the non-compact case, it cannot depend on any of the additional constraints.

thus, appropriate factorization of the u(1)s must follow from the conditions already

imposed by cancellation of non-abelian anomalies, as we have shown above.

4.2 mixed gravitational anomalies

we can use a similar computation to show that the cancellation of mixed u(1)-

gravitational anomalies does not impose further constraints. this may appear puzzling

at rst sight, since gravitational anomalies are relevant only for compact models. one

could expect their cancellation would involve some (or even all) of the additional tad-

pole cancellation conditions. so let us give an intuitive argument (of partial validity)

to understand this fact before entering the detailed computation.

again, we use the realization of these gauge theories in terms of d3-branes at

orientifold singularities. certainly, in the non-compact limit gravity propagates in all

ten dimensions, not just in the four-dimensions where the gauge theory lives, and so

there is no obvious reason why the mixed u(1)-gravitational anomalies should cancel.

22

however, some of these singularities can be embedded in compact calabi-yau spaces

(not necessarily toroidal orbifolds). this does not change the spectrum of the eld

theory on the d3-branes, since they only feel local physics, but has the eect that

gravitational anomalies become relevant, and must cancel. since the mixed u(1)-

gravitational anomaly receives contributions only from elds living on the d3 branes,

it follows that gravitational anomalies must cancel for non-compact singularities if they

can be embedded in a global model. following the argument in the previous subsection,

this shows that, for these singularities, factorization of gravitational anomalies must

be automatic once cancellation of non-abelian anomalies is imposed.

obviously, this argument does not apply to general singularities, since most sin-

gularities cannot be embedded in global contexts. the explicit computation below,

however, shows the conclusion concerning the absence of new constraints is indeed true

for any singularity.

let us consider the case of even order orientifolds (odd order orientifolds can be

analyzed similarly). starting from the spectrum given in section 3.2, the mixed anomaly
t grav.

for the ith u(1) factor (in the 55 sector) can be shown to be

t grav.

the gravitational anomaly for u(1) from the 99 sector has the same structure, with the
replacement ni  ui. for future convenience, let us note that by using the condition
for the cancellation of non-abelian anomalies (3.23), we can rewrite (4.6) as

cancels (4.7).

as an explicit example of the above discussion consider the z12 orientifold. the gs
factors eq.(4.8) are agrav

eq.(3.47). for instance for the rst and second u(1) factors in the 55 sector we obtain

if non-abelian anomaly cancellation equations (3.52) are used then terms inside brack-

ets vanish and the correct contributions to be canceled by gs terms are obtained. the

other cases proceed in the same way.

5 conclusions and remarks

we have studied the relationship between cancellation of tadpoles and anomalies in

compact type iib d = 4 vacua. we have found that only a subset of the tadpole

conditions are in general needed in order to get anomaly cancellations.

it is worth discussing what characterizes the twisted tadpoles whose cancellation is

not required in order to get anomaly cancellation. in order to do that it is useful to do a

t-duality transformation along the three complex compact dimensions. now we have 3-

branes and 7-branes (with their world-volume including the rst two complex compact

planes) instead of 9-branes and 5-branes. we can now decompactify and consider the

d = 4, n = 1 eld theory living in the intersection of the 3-branes and 7-branes. now,

in this non-compact orientifold one has to impose the tadpole conditions corresponding

to a given twist only if the ux of the rr charge originating at the xed point cannot
escape to innity. for example, as we discussed in section 3, in the z3  z3 orientifold
one has to impose the tadpole condition only for the twist v = 1
3(1, 1,2), because for
twists leaving one xed complex plane like e.g., v = 1
3(1,1, 0) the rr ux can escape
to innity. in the z12 case, which is another case in which a particular tadpole equation
(3.46) is not needed to get anomaly cancellation, something similar happens. in this
case the twist is of the form v = 1
4(1,1, 0) and the rr ux can escape to innity
(in the non-compact case) through the third complex plane which is transverse to the

d7-brane worldvolume. now, coming back to the compact orientifold case, since the

massless charged spectrum from open strings is the same for both compact and non-

24

compact cases, the models are still going to be anomaly-free. thus the extra tadpole

equations needed in the compact case will not be related to anomaly cancellation.

the z6 orientifold example shows again how things go. in this case one would be
tempted to say that tadpoles associated to the twist 2v = 1/3(1, 0,1) should not be
needed for anomaly cancellation, since the rr-ux could escape through the second

complex plane. but that is not the case because the plane which is transverse to the

d7-branes is the third one, which is rotated, no ux can escape through it.

from the d = 4 eective eld theory point of view a natural question emerges.

if there are tadpole constraints which are not needed for gauge anomaly cancellation,

what is the low-energy symmetry which is guaranteed by them? we do not have a

denite answer to that question but it seems sensible to believe that some other type

of symmetries are guaranteed by them.

in particular all these models have sigma-

model u(1) symmetries as well as discrete gauge symmetries and cancellation of their

anomalies could require the extra constraints [26].

let us nally comment on the d = 6 case. in d = 6, n = 1 models, anomaly

and tadpole cancellation conditions are totally equivalent since there are no twists

with unrotated complex planes and no possibility for the rr ux to escape. indeed,

an explicit analysis along the lines we described for the d = 4 case gives rise to this

equivalence. concerning new solutions to the tadpole cancellation conditions, it is easy

to see that the z2, z3 and z4 d = 6, n = 1 models of [27, 28] have as unique solutions
the ones given in those references. however the z6 orientifold admits more solutions
than those reported there. the reason for this, as it happened in the d = 4 case is

that the z6 twist (unlike the other three cases) has only one xed point, the one at the
origin. thus the rr ux due to d9-branes can partially cancel that from d5-branes

and lead to new solutions. the general group one can obtain is the same as that in

(3.34).
