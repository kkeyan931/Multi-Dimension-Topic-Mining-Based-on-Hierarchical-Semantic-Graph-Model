abstract

we propose a new mechanism for the formation of conical singularities on
dbranes by means of recoil resulting from scattering of closed string states
propagating in the (large) transverse dimensions. by viewing the (spatial
part of the) fourdimensional world as a 3brane with large transverse di-
mensions the above mechanism can lead to supersymmetry obstruction at
the tev scale. the vacuum remains supersymmetric while the mass spec-
trum picks up a supersymmetry obstructing mass splitting. the state with
broken supersymmetry is not an equilibrium ground state, but is rather
an excited state of the dbrane which relaxes to the supersymmetric ground
state asymptotically in (cosmic) time.

the issue of supersymmetry breaking remains unresolved; while supersymmetry pro-
vides a natural explanation for the vanishing of the cosmological constant (vacuum energy)
and oers a resolution of the hierarchy problem it is not a symmetry of the lowenergy
world. softly broken supersymmetry can still control the higgs mass and resolve the hierar-
chy problem, but radiative corrections to standard model processes measured in precision
electroweak experiments at lep coupled with direct higgs and sparticle searches require
that the scale of supersymmetry breaking (i.e.
the masses of the lightest sparticles) be
no more than a few tev without requiring unnatural ne tuning of the standard model
parameters [1]. some years ago a novel scenario for generating massive sparticles while
maintaining the vanishing cosmological constant was proposed [2]. the scenario referred to
(2+1)dimensional supergravity theories and, instead of breaking supersymmetry, involved
the obstruction of supersymmetry by massive states in the spectrum of supergravity living
in a spacetime with conical singularities. in fact, as pointed out in reference [2] based on
work in reference [3], any state in (2+1) dimensions which has nonzero energy produces
a geometry which is asymptotically conical.
in such spacetimes there are no covariantly
constant spinors; given that in supersymmetry the unbroken supercharges are spinor elds
which are covariantly constant at innity, this suggests that there are no unbroken super-
symmetries in (2+1)dimensional supergravity theories. the bosefermi degeneracy in the
massive spectrum is lifted in proportion to the decit angle  of the conical geometry,

 = 2g3m

(1)

where m is the mass splitting, and g3 is the threedimensional newtons constant [3].
however, the vacuum energy (cosmological constant) remains zero, given that the vacuum
state remains supersymmetric.

an explicit realization of the above phenomenon in the context of a specic supergrav-
ity model in three spacetime dimensions has been provided in reference [4], while conical
singularities in the context of n = 1 supergravity in four spacetime dimensions have been
discussed in [5]. the presence of conical singularities on any einstein manifold x will in
general lead to a complete breaking of supersymmetry, except for special choices of the
manifold x, in which case some supersymmetries may survive. their number depends on
the number of covariantly constant spinors (or equivalently the number of killing spinors)
on the manifold x. for certain geometries a classication of the unbroken supersymmetries
is complete [6].
in the present work we shall be interested in the case where the break-
ing of supersymmetry is complete; in particular we shall be interested in fourdimensional
n = 1 supergravity models, viewed as lowenergy eld theories of some string (or dbrane)
theories.

the point of this article is to describe what is in our opinion a novel way to generate
conical singularities on the fourdimensional world by adopting the modern view [79] that
the fourdimensional spacetime we observe is actually a dbrane living in a higher(ten
or eleven)dimensional universe. only closed string states (gravitons) propagate in the
dimensions transverse to the brane while gauge and matter elds are described by open
string states ending on the brane. consistent embeddings of this idea in detailed string
models have recently been discussed in references [8, 9].

despite the fact that in such a picture the detailed dynamics of the bulk higher
dimensional spacetime is not fully known, several nontrivial predictions for the (lowenergy)

2

physics on fourdimensional spacetime can emerge [7]. in this article we shall point out yet
another prediction, that of supersymmetry obstruction at the tev scale.

we rst note an important ingredient of the closed string scattering: that of the resulting
recoil of the dbrane [1012]. this has been ignored in most discussions of the scattering
process, such as emission of closed string states into the bulk and/or absorption by the brane.
from a worldsheet viewpoint the recoil is described [10] by deformations of the pertinent
model which obey a logarithmic conformal algebra [13]. field theories described by such
algebras lie on the border between conformal eld theories and general renormalizable two
dimensional quantum eld theories. the fact that recoil of a dbrane is described not by
an ordinary conformal eld theory but by a logarithmic one is associated with the fact that
the recoil process describes a change of state in the model background, and as such is a
nonequilibrium process. this is reected [11, 12] in the logarithmic operator algebra itself.
it has been argued recently [14] that when properly taken into account the recoil may
lead to nontrivial phenomena on the brane such as stochastic uctuations in the arrival
times of photons propagating on the brane. given that such eects are considerably larger
in size than the string scale, it is evident that they are further enhanced in the picture of
reference [7] where the string scale in the bulk is of the order of a tev. in reference [14] this
has been used to place bounds on consistent string models of large extra dimensions [9].

in the present article the recoil process will be discussed in conjunction with another
phenomenon that characterizes such theories, namely supersymmetry obstruction on the
brane. our objective is to discuss the appearance and nature of the conical singularities
due to the recoil process, mentioned in references [10, 14], and then to estimate the order of
magnitude of the induced supersymmetry obstruction [2].

as discussed in references [1012] in the case of dbrane string solitons, their recoil after
interaction with a closed string (graviton) state is characterized in a worldsheet context by
a model deformed by pairs of logarithmic operators [13]:

c i

  (x i),

di

  x i(x i),

i  {0, . . . , 3}

(2)

dened on the boundary  of the string worldsheet. here x i obey neumann boundary
conditions on the string worldsheet, and denote the brane coordinates. the remaining
yi, i  {4, . . . , 9} denote the transverse directions. in the case of dparticles, examined in
references [1012], i takes the value 0 only, in which case the operators (2) act as deforma-
tions of the conformal eld theory on the worldsheet: the operator

uiz

nx id

describes the shift of the dbrane induced by the scattering, where ui is its recoil velocity,
and

yiz

nx ic

describes quantum uctuations in the initial position yi of the dparticle.
it has been
shown [12] that energymomentum is conserved during the recoil process. we also note that
ui = gspi, where pi is the momentum and gs is the string coupling, which is assumed here

3

to be weak enough to ensure that dbranes are very massive, with mass md = 1/(sgs),
where s is the string length. from these one obtains ui = sgs(k1
i ), where k1 (k2) is
the momentum of the propagating closed string state before (after) the recoil.

i + k2

in the case of dpbranes, the pertinent deformations are slightly more complicated. as

discussed in reference [10], the deformations are given by

and xi
the 0i component of the tensor couplings g

and coordinates of the dbrane as in the dparticle case above, but now there are additional
couplings g
ii, i 6= 0, describing the bending of the dbrane under the emission of a closed
string state propagating in a transverse direction, as shown schematically in fig. 1.

the correct specication of the logarithmic pair in equation (2) entails a regulating

parameter   0+, which appears inside the (t) operator:

(x i) = z d

in order to realize the logarithmic algebra between the operators c and d, one takes [10]:

2  ln[l/a]  ,

(3)

where l (a) are infrared (ultraviolet) worldsheet cutos. the recoil operators (2) are
slightly relevant, in the sense of the renormalization group for the worldsheet eld theory,
having small conformal dimensions  = 2/2. thus the model perturbed by these
operators is not conformal for  6= 0, and the theory requires liouville dressing [11, 15, 16].

the relevant twopoint functions have the following form:

2 + 2 log |z/a|2(cid:19)

(4)

which in the limit   0+ gives the logarithmic algebra [13] modulo the leading divergence
in the hddi recoil correlation function.

the identication (3) turns out to be very important for our purposes here. as discussed
in references [10,17], under worldsheet scaling transformations parameterized by variations
of the cuto

l 7 l = let



2 7 2 =

1 + 22t

,

then as a result of the logarithmic algebra (4) the operators c and d transform as

d 7 d = d + tc,
c 7 c = c

which implies a similar transformation for the couplings. in particular, the the g2
couplings are shifted as

ii bending

ii 7 (g2

ii) = g2

ii + g1

iit,

ii couplings remain invariant. from this and the fact that g2,1

while the g1
0i are interpreted
respectively as the collective coordinates and momenta of the recoiling dbrane, one observes
that the scale 2 may be interpreted as a galilean time for the (heavy) defect system.

it is important to understand the connexion of this time with the physical time as
measured by an observer on the brane. to answer this question we remark that the world
sheet renormalization group scale ln |l/a|2 may be associated with the zeromode of the
liouville eld [15, 16], which in turn is identied with the target time t on the brane, as
justied in detail in references [11, 12]. from this one immediately has the identication

2  t,

where the time t is measured in string units ts = s/c, where s is the string length. the
constant of proportionality  can be determined as follows: the liouville eld used to dress
and hence restore conformal invariance [15, 16] in the nonconformal model perturbed by
the recoil operators [11] has a kinetic term in the model of the form:

z

d2z q2()2

(5)

where  denotes a (closed string) worldsheet surface. the central charge decit q2 =
c[g]  c  is written in terms of the running central charge c[g] given by the zamolodchikov

5

cfunction which can in turn be dened by an appropriate combination of the twopoint
worldsheet correlation functions of the stress tensor for the model htti (the indices
run over worldsheet coordinates). for closed string excitations the worldsheet is assumed
to be a sphere, with euler characteristic  = 2. this implies that the worldsheet correlation
functions entering in the expression for the cfunction will have a prefactor of 1/g2
s. for the
weakly coupled string theories in which we are interested, and for which the recoil formalism
of references [10, 12] applies, the detailed analysis of reference [12] demonstrated that the
identication of the liouville mode  with the target time t leads to a consistent interpre-
tation of the central charge decit q2 in the deformed model. the recoil is described by
an eective lagrangian in target space of borninfeld type as a result of the identication:

q2

to leading orders in world-sheet perturbation theory.

the set of bending couplings g1

ii  gii, i  {0, . . . , p}, i  {p + 1, . . . , 9}, are relevant

couplings with a worldsheet renormalizationgroup function of the form

g =

gii =

2t

gii,

t  2

(6)

which implies that one may construct an exactly marginal set of couplings gii by redening

gii 

gii


(7)

the renormalized couplings g0i in [12] play the role of the physical recoil velocity of the
dbrane, while the remaining gii, i 6= 0, describe the bending of the dpbrane, p 6= 0.

by following an analysis similar to that for the dparticle case in reference [12] it can
easily be shown that the renormalized bending couplings gii are related to the sum of
momenta of the closed string states along the transverse directions k1,2

as follows:

i

gii 

gs
ms

(k1

i + k2

i ),

i  {0, . . . , p},

i  {p + 1, . . . , 9}

(8)

where ms  1
s

is the string scale (in units where  = c = 1).

in this way we nd that gii = o(1) for closed string excitations with planckian energies of
order ms/gs, in which case q2  0. for any other lowenergy state e  ms/gs q2  1/g2
s.
we now notice that from a target spacetime point of view such a kinetic term contributes
to the g00 temporal component of the metric. in order to obtain a robertsonwalker type
of targetspace universe under the above identications, it is crucial that we rescale the
liouville mode  to q before identifying it with the (observable) cosmic time tphys. in this
way, from (3), one obtains

2 = gstphys

(9)

where tphys is the physical (cosmic) time in string units ts, pertaining to a robertsonwalker
universe.

6

the identication (9) implies that the recoil/bending deformation operators giir d can

be expressed in terms of the marginal couplings gii through (reinstating the string timescale
ts)

gii 

gs
ms

(k1

gstphys(cid:19)1/2

(10)

which in turn implies that the conical singularities on the dbrane due to these deformations
will have a decit angle which will be decaying with time as t1/2
phys , as the system relaxes
towards its ground state. therefore if we view the world as a dbrane living in a higher
dimensional string (or mtheory) universe, then a scattering process whereby a closed string
state propagates in the transverse extra dimensions will excite the dbrane through recoil.
this will create a conical singularity at the time of the scattering event whose formation
can be described by deforming the worldsheet model by recoil operators. it is crucial
to identify the worldsheet renormalizationgroup scale with the target time for the mathe-
matical consistency of the logarithmic algebra [11, 12]. this identication naturally implies
a relaxation process for the recoiling brane.

during this relaxation process the presence of a conical singularity with decit angle

  gs

implies supersymmetry obstruction with mass splittings given by a formula analogous to
(1), where now g should be newtons constant on the dbrane. the latter is related to
the fourdimensional planck mass scale m (4)
p  ms/gs  1019 gev. thus the induced
supersymmetryobstructing mass splitting m would be of the form:

m  m (4)

(12)

the result (12) has to be interpreted with care. first of all one should note that asymptot-
ically in time tphys   the splitting tends to zero, implying the restoration of supersym-
metry in the spectrum. this is natural from the point of view adopted here, i.e. that the
world we live on is a 3brane in a recoiling excited state after scattering with a closed string
state. the lowenergy supersymmetry obstruction today is a result of the relaxation of the
brane.

in this scenario, at early times tphys  ts, the dbrane had a small size, of order of the
string length s. therefore the closed string states trapped on it should have uncertainties in
energies of order m (4)
p , implying that at times tphys  ts after the initial scattering event, the
recoiling dbrane would have experienced obstructed supersymmetry with mass splittings

this initial splitting diminishes as the time elapses according to

one may arrange for the present day supersymmetry obstruction to be of order a few tev
by selecting appropriately the frequency of the scattering events, i.e. the quantities tphys,
gs and ts. for instance, for a scattering event occurring at early cosmological times, e.g.
at the time of last scattering tphys  1026/c, for large string sizes ts  1027 s, as in the
scenario of reference [7], and small couplings gs  1014, as required for a consistent string
theory embedding of such scenarios in type iib closed string theories [9], one obtains from
(14) a supersymmetry obstruction scale today of order of a few tev.

in the type i open string case [8] there exist d3branes as solutions in the model, with
the restriction that only gravitational closed string states can propagate in the bulk, exactly
as required by the picture of reference [7]. in this model the string coupling gs is given by
the yangmills ne structure constant at the string scale,

gs = 4g(ms).

according to reference [14] this results in stochastic uctuations in the arrival times of
photons with energy e and travelling a distance l of

t  g

le
ms

.

astrophysical data on gamma ray bursters are sensitive [18] to t  le/mqg with mqg 
1015 gev, whence the type i model seems incompatible with a low (tev) string scale [14],
and hence also with tev scale supersymmetry obstruction by the mechanism described here.
in this article we have presented a mechanism by which supersymmetry can be obstructed
on our world at the tev scale as a result of dbrane recoil within the large extra dimension
picture of reference [7]. supersymmetry is obstructed by a planck scale mass splitting
on the brane as a result of the formation of a conical singularity. as this excited state
of the brane relaxes back to the ground state the scale of supersymmetry obstruction is
lowered. we stress that this is a nonequilibrium process, and that the relaxation we have
described diers fundamentally from the slow rolling by which a false vacuum decays to
a true vacuum. in our case supersymmetry is obstructed [2] so that the vacuum remains
supersymmetric, and hence the cosmological constant on the brane vanishes, and it is only
the matter spectrum which does not respect supersymmetry as a result of the excited state
of the brane.

as stressed above, this scenario for supersymmetry obstruction is based on the liouville
(non-critical-string) approach to dbrane recoil, which involves the identication of the
target time with the liouville mode. moreover, for the scenario to yield viable phenomeno-
logical predictions, it is essential that the extra dimensions are relatively large, compared
with the planck scale, and that the emission of closed string states from the brane into the
bulk is a very rare event. such rare emissions, although compatible with the depletion of
closed string states due to ination, are still far from being understood at a satisfactory
level of mathematical rigour in the context of the liouville-string approach to dbrane re-
coil. this would require a detailed knowledge of the udnerlying non-perturbative dbrane
dynamics, which is still lacking. nevertheless, we believe that the scenario for supersymme-
try obstruction presented here is of sucient interest to motivate further detailed studies of
such issues.
