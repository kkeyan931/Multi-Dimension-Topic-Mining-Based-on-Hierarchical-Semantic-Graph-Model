abstract

we study massless and massive hawking radiations on a two-dimensional

ads spacetime. for the massless case, the quantum stress-energy tensor of a

massless scalar eld on the ads background is calculated, and the expected

null radiation is obtained. however, for the massive case, the scattering analy-

sis is performed in order to calculate the absorption and reection coecients

which are related to statistical hawking temperature. on the contrary to the

massless case, we obtain a nonvanishing massive radiation.

there has been a great interest in a lower-dimensional gravity since it is possi-

ble to construct a consistent and renormalizable quantum gravity without encountering

some complexities of four-dimensional realistic models.

in the callan-giddings-harvey-

strominger(cghs) model [1], the asymptotically at black hole solution is obtained under

a linear dilaton background and the quantum eect of the black hole can be described by

hawking radiation [2]. in general, a thermal equilibrium state of the black hole with the

thermal bath is dened by the hartle-hawking(hh) vacuum [3,4].

from the cghs model, the two-dimensional anti-de sitter(ads2) solution can be ob-

tained by assuming a constant dilaton background [5], which is in contrasted with the original

cghs solution in that the curvature scalar of ads spacetime is constant and its asymptotic

metric is no more minkowski spacetime. this phenomenon has already appeared in the

three-dimensional low energy string theory [6], so that the asymptotically at black string

solution is obtained on the presence of the dilaton charge while the asymptotically nonat

banados-teitelboim-zanelli(btz) [7] solution is derived for the constant dilaton background.

on the other hand, in connection with the calculation of the statistical entropy of the ex-

tremal reissener-nordstrom black hole, the ads2 geometry has been intensively studied in

refs. [8,9].

on the other hand, it has been shown that the massless hawking radiation on this ads

background does not appear [5,10] whereas it is possible to radiate if the dilaton eld couples

to the massless scalar eld [11]. it is now natural to ask what happens for the massive case

on this metric background. so we would like to study whether the massive radiation on the

ads2 spacetime background is possible or not in terms of the scattering analysis, which was

given for the massless case in ref [10]. in this paper, for the massless case, the stress-energy

tensor calculation will be done on the ads2 background and the null radiation will be found,

which is essentially compatible with the result of the null radiation through the scattering

analysis [11]. in this paper we mainly study the massive scalar eld on the ads2 background

and calculate the scattering amplitudes in order to obtain the hawking temperature. we

nally obtain some unexpected result on the hawking temperature.

2

we rst study the massless radiation on the ads2 background by calculating the stress-

energy tensors of the conformal matter eld. this conrms the expected vanishing hawking

radiation. now the two-dimensional action for the conformal matter is given as

sm = 

1

2 z dx2g (f )2 ,

(1)

where f is a massless scalar eld. the eective action of the scalar eld is written as the

polyakov induced gravity action,

sef f =

r,

and equally written as a local form of

sef f = 

1

96 z dx2g[2 + 2r],

by introducing the auxiliary eld  satisfying

2 = r.

the stress-energy tensor is

where  = t  r and r(r) = r dr 1

g(r).

to derive the hartle-hawking temperature for the massless scalar eld on the two di-

mensional ads2 background, we consider the ads black hole metric given as a solution of

the cghs model with the constant dilaton background [5]

where the horizon is located at rh = m . the auxiliary eld in eq.(4) is exactly solved

on the background (8). the integration constants a, b, c will be determined by some bound-

ary conditions. by using eqs.(8) and (9), the explicit expression of the stress-energy tensors

(5) in terms of the schwarzschild coordinate is given as

(10)

(11)

(12)

now we impose the hartle-hawking boundary condition on the stress-energy tensors. the

black hole embedded in the thermal bath satises the equilibrium condition which is de-

scribed as < t > |rrh = 0 together with c = 0 [3,4,12], and then the parameters are
xed as a =  2m
and b = 0. if we make the auxiliary eld nite at the horizon, we can
choose a = 2m

. this boundary condition determines the behavior of the stress-energy





tensors which are expressed as

< t >hh = 0,
1
< t+ >hh =

482   r2

2  m! .

as expected, from the relation, th = 1

 t [1], the hartle-hawking state gives the vanishing
temperature of th = 0 for the massless case, and this fact is compatible with the scattering

analysis given in ref. [10].

let us now study the massive radiation from the ads2 black hole. unfortunately, we do

not have an exact form of the eective action unlike the massless case and the calculation

of the stress-energy tensor of the massive scalar is not straightforward, which is recently

discussed in ref. [9].

instead, we want to study the hawking radiation for the massive

scalar eld following the scattering procedure which is successful for the massless eld case

in refs. [10,11].

then the massive scalar eld equation is

(2 + m2)f (r, t) = 0,

(15)

where m is a mass parameter.

it is written as a spatial equation by using the ansatz,

f (r, t) = r(r)eit, which is given as

(r2  r2

h)2

r r(r) + 2rrr(r) +

1

(r2  r2
h)

[24 + m22(r2  r2

h)]r(r) = 0.

(16)

by use of the change of variable z = rrh
r+rh

(0 < z < 1), the eld equation (16) is written as

z(1  z)2

z r(z) + (1  z)zr(z) +" 24

4r2

h (cid:18) 1

z  1(cid:19) +

m22

1  z# r(z) = 0.

(17)

to eliminate two singularities at z = 0 and z = 1, we set r(z) = z(1  z)g(z) and then
the wave equation becomes

z(1  z)2

z g(z) + [1 + 2  (1 + 2 + 2)z]zg(z)

and  = (1  1  4m22)/2, and then get the nal form of the

z g(z) + [1 + 2  (1 + 2 + 2)z]zg(z)   ( + 2) g(z) = 0.

(19)

actually, we have two roots satisfying 2   + m22 = 0, however, we take the negative
sign because there exists massless limit( = 0). note that we assume our semiclassical

approximation is valid only for the case that the energy of our test eld is properly small,

and we need not consider the back reaction of the geometry. the curvature of the ads

geometry is proportional to 1

2 , and we assume m2 is less than 1

2 ,  is approximately m22.

the eld equation (19) can be solved as

rbulk(z) = coutz(1  z)f (,  + 2, 1 + 2, z)
+ cinz(1  z)f (,   2, 1  2, z).

(20)

this hypergeometric solution is symmetric under the exchange of   , so we may take
in the near horizon limit , the solution (20) is
the positive value of  for convenience.

ln(cid:16) rrh
r+rh(cid:17) + cinei 2

2rh

ln(cid:16) rrh
r+rh(cid:17).

(21)

in eq.(21), it is independent of  and the asymptotic form of the eld solution is remarkably

same with that of the massless scalar eld [10]. this fact is plausible in that the wave

frequency is ultraviolet shift in the near horizon limit and the mass term can be negligible

compared to the wave number in the dispersion relation. so in this region, the scalar eld

can be regard as a massless conformal eld.

next, we can nd the far region solution by using the z  1  z transformation of the

hypergeometric function [13],

f (a, b, c; z) =

(c)(c  a  b)
(c  a)(c  b)
+ (1  z)cab (c)(a + b  c)

(a)(b)

f (a, b, a + b  c + 1; 1  z)

f (c  a, c  b, c  a  b + 1; 1  z).

(22)

note that our transformed solution has no massless limit  = 0 because the hypergeometric

function of the transformed solution is not dened for  = 0. thus this solution is only valid

for the case of the massive scalar eld and it is meaningless at this stage to take the massless

limit. if r goes to innity, from eqs.(20) and (22), the far solution can be expanded as

6

(1 + 2)(2  1)

(23)

note that this asymptotic solution was derived from the exact bulk solution. at this stage,

we should carefully consider the boundary geometry of this ads black hole because it is

nontrivial in contrast to the asymptotically at black hole. the background geometry of

the usual black hole at the asymptotically far region is happened to be that of the massless

limit of the black hole geometry. so, in that case, the far region limit means the massless

limit of the black hole geometry. in our model, however, this is not the case. therefore, we

should take a boundary metric by dening m = 0 in eq.(16). then the equation of motion

at the boundary is given as

r22

r r(r) + 2rrr(r) +

1

r2 (cid:16)24 + m22r2(cid:17) r(r) = 0

(24)

by setting rh = 0 from eq.(16). this equation (24) yields the solution of a linear combination

of the bessel functions j and j,

rboundary(r) =

1

r  a1j  2

r ! + a2j 2

r !! ,

where  is dened as   1

2  . for a large r, we can rewrite this solution (25) as

rboundary(r) = b1

1
r + b2

1
r1 .

(25)

(26)

to decompose this boundary solution into ingoing and outgoing modes, we dene our coef-

cients b1 and b2 in eq.(26) in terms of new coecients bin and bout,

b1  bin + bout,
b2 

i


(2rh)12(bin  bout).

(27)

then the boundary solution can be written as

7

rboundary(r) =

r "bin 1 +

 (cid:18)2rh

r (cid:19)12! + bout 1 

i

 (cid:18)2rh

r (cid:19)12!# .

(28)

now we match eq.(23) with eq.(28) to get the relations between far coecients and bound-

ary coecients. then two relations between these coecients are obtained as

bin =

bout =

1

2 "(2rh) cout

(29)

the ingoing mode(outgoing mode) at the boundary can be represented as ingoing and out-

going modes at the bulk [14]. from the following denition of the ux,

2

i   r2  r2

2

h

we explicitly calculate the radiation ux at the boundary as

(30)

(31)

where we imposed the appropriate boundary condition that there does not exist the outgoing

mode near the black hole horizon, i.e., cout = 0 [15]. then the reection coecient is

represented by the ratio of the ingoing and the outgoing amplitude,

r = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
= (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(33)

and this formal expression can be explicitly evaluated in the small mass compared to the

given curvature scale of ads geometry, which is plausible approximation in that we have

not considered the back reaction of the geometry. the useful formulas for some expansions

of the gamma functions are summarized as follows,

(34)

where  is an eulers constant, (z) is a digamma function, and (3) is the riemann zeta

function (3) = pk=1 k3 = 1.20205  . then the reection coecient is simply given as

r =

4(rh
4(rh

2 + 2(3)2m26) + 224(1 + 4m22)  4rh2(1 + 2m22)
2 + 2(3)2m26) + 224(1 + 4m22) + 4rh2(1 + 2m22)

.

(35)

we can obtain the hawking temperature from the following relation,

< 0|n|0 > =
=

r
1  r

e

th  1

where n is a number operator [14]. the hawking temperature is simply expressed as

th = 



ln r

(36)

(37)

in terms of the reection coecient. note that we expand the reection coecient with

respect to the frequency  and the mass m, and ln r term in the denominator is proportional

to , which yields the hawking temperature

th =

rh

22 "1  2m22 1 +

22
24r2

h!# + o(m3).

(38)

it would be interesting to note that the massless limit does not recover the well-known null

temperature. as was shown in ref. [5,10] there does not exist the massless radiation on

ads2 background, and naturally the corresponding hawking temperature vanishes. for the

massless case, the transformation rule of the hypergeometric function (22) can not be used

9

because it is singular and the transformation rule for the massless case is somewhat dierent.

in this massive case, the nonvanishing result is in fact unexpected. one might think that

the massive hawking radiation does not appear since the massless radiation does not occur

on the ads background. however, as was discussed in ref. [11], even for the massless case

the hawking radiation is possible if the massless scalar eld couples to some background

elds, for example, the dilaton eld. so in the present massive case, the mass term seems

to play a role of the constant background eld.

the nal point to be mentioned is that the asymptotic behaviors for the cases of the

massless eld, the dilaton coupled massless eld, and the present massive eld. in the near

horizon, the asymptotic behaviors of the three cases are coincident, which means that the

dilaton coupled massless eld and the massive eld behave like a conformal type massless

eld. at the innite boundary, however, three cases show dierent aspects unlike those of

the near the horizon. first, for the massless eld case, the boundary solution is given as

massless (r) = aoutei 2
rboundary

r + ainei 2
r .

(39)

if r goes to the asymptotic innity, the boundary solution becomes a constant. next, for

the massless eld with the dilaton background, the boundary solution becomes

rboundary

dilaton

(r) = aout 1  i

r2
h

r2! + ain 1 + i

r2
h

r2! .

(40)

note that this solution is also constant at the boundary. for the massive eld case, the

boundary solution is given as

rboundary

massive (r) = aout

1

r  1 

i

 (cid:18)2rh

r (cid:19)12! + ain

1

r  1 +

i

 (cid:18)2rh

r (cid:19)12! ,

(41)

where it vanishes at the innity due to the eect of the eld mass. therefore the massive eld

is conned within the innite boundary. on the other hand, the key ingredient of the null

radiation for the massless case is due to the asymptotic forms of the eld solutions. for the

massless case, the boundary solution is the same with the far region solution in the ads bulk,

which means that the modes mixing does not occur, whereas both for the dilaton coupled

10

and the massive case, the boundary solution is drastically dierent of the far region solution

from the bulk so that the bulk solution can be decomposed into the ingoing and the outgoing

modes at the boundary. therefore, this fact gives the nonvanishing hawking temperature in

the latter two cases. we conclude that in two dimensions the massive hawking radiation of

ads black hole is possible since the mass term in the eld equation plays a role of a constant

background eld, which is similar to the dilaton coupled case.
