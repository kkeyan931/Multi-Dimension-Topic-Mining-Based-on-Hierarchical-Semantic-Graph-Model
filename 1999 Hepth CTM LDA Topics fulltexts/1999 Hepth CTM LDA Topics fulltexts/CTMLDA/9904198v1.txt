1 introduction

the most important advances in the knowledge of the nonperturbative aspects in string
theory have been due to the discovery and the study of dbranes and mtheory. the
rst have revealed to be essential in the construction of a consistent theory of strings and
also very important to test geometry at substringy scale. the latter has opened the
possibility to have interesting informations on the strong coupling limit of such theories.
a striking example of the new aspects discovered by considering dbranes as probes
of stringy interactions is that spacetime is a derived rather than a primary concept,
arising as the moduli space of dbrane worldvolume gauge theories. some specic
analyses [1, 2, 3], where branes are placed at orbifold singularities, show indeed such an
unexpected feature.

another important developement that has recently emerged is the possible relation
between certain gauge theories, describing worldvolume theories of large numbers of d or
mbranes, and superstring or mtheory on backgrounds of the factorised form ads  h,
with h a compact manifold [4, 5].

in at space the conjectured equivalence relation species h to be a sphere, as
adsp+2  sdp2 arises as the horizon manifold for a dp or mpbrane in ddimensions.
this is no longer true if we place the branes on singular spaces. since there is no ob-
struction to placing the branes at the singular point, the horizon h will now be dierent
from the one we had at smooth points (i.e. the sphere). this leads to the possibility of
deriving superconformal gauge theories with less than the maximal supersymmetry.

in string theory, the scft describing dbranes at orbifold singularities can be derived
by projecting out the invariant states and the potential from the at space theory [1, 2, 6].
on other kind of singularities, such as conifolds, one must nd others and indirect ways
of derivation. among many attempts regarding this kind of singularities [7, 8], the most
satisfying way seems to be the one outlined in [9]. if one can nd an orbifold, from which
a partial resolution leads to the desired singularity, the corresponding gauge theory can
be derived from the orbifold one by giving appropriate expectation values to some of the
moduli elds and studying the reduced theory. the choice is obviously related to the
way of resolving the orbifold singularity and it is controlled by the fayetilioupulos terms
(governed by the twisted string sectors).

for d3branes in type iib string theory, the relevant singularities are the gorenstein
canonical singularities in c3 and a wide class is given by those which can be described by
toric geometry2 some of which have been carefully studied in [9].

a natural generalization would be to study the fundamental branes of mtheory at

c4/ singularities. this could lead to threedimensional theories with n  8.

there are many problems connected with this programme, from the absence of a
complete classication of such gorenstein singularities, to the possibility of having singular

horizons [10]. good and interesting cases are the ones where the horizon is given by a
coset space of dimension seven. generic coset manifolds admitting an einstein metric have
been described in [11], while the sevendimensional ones have been completely classied
in [12]. these spaces can be retrieved as horizon manifolds for m2branes placed at the
singular point of a space of the form m3  c(h) where c(h) is the eightdimensional
cone over the cosetspace [13].

in this paper we deal with such singular cones when the corresponding supergravity
theory preserves n = 2 supersymmetry. the language we will use is that of toric geom-
etry. this is indeed an eective way of describing the classical dbrane moduli space as
pointed out in [1, 14] and also a very simple tool to deal with ade singularities. for an
introduction to toric geometry for physicists see [15]. a more rigorous exposition can be
found in the book by fulton [16] and recent developements are exposed in [17]. some
useful considerations about equations dening toric varieties and combinatorial aspects
can be found in [18, 19].

in the next section we are going to describe the n = 2 c(h) cones in this language,
specifying the charge matrices for their denition as a symplectic quotient. in section three
we show which are the classes of gorenstein c4/ singularities allowed by the physical
consistency requirements and show which resolutions can lead to the conifold singularities
we want to describe. the last section contains some comments on the related n = 2 eld
theories.

2 the cones over coset manifolds

elevendimensional supergravity can be spontaneously compactied through the freund
rubin mechanism to a space of the form ads4  h 7, where h 7 is one of the coset spaces
classied in [12]. the cases we want to analyse are the n = 2 ones, namely the qppp, the
m ppr and the v5,2, which are dened as the following group quotients

su(2)  su(2)  su(2)

u(1)  u(1)

,

su(3)  su(2)  u(1)

su(2)  u(1)

,

and

so(5)
so(3)

.

for the sake of simplicity, for the rst two classes of manifolds, we are going to choose a
single representative given by q111 and m 110. it is worth pointing out that all the other
m ppr manifolds can be derived from m 110 by quotienting with a suitable cyclic group [12].
since we want to use the language of toric geometry we have to give a description of
these manifolds in such a language. the starting point to make this construction is a
theorem reported in [20] which states that if s is a compact quasi-regular homogeneous
sasakianeinstein manifold, then s is a circle-bundle over a generalized ag manifold.
since our sevendimensional manifolds are sasakieinstein we can apply such a theorem.
the q111 manifold could be recovered as a circle bundle over p1  p1  p1, m 110 bering
over p2  p1 and the stiefel manifold v5,2 bering over the real grassmanian of projective
lines in the real p4.

2

the essential requirement is that these manifolds admit a toric description. we will
see that q111, m 110 and their cones can be easily described by toric geometry, but this is
not the case for the stiefel manifold. this manifold can be described [7] as the following
surface embedded in p4:

z2
i = 0.

(2.1)

5xi=1

we also know that a toric manifold can always be described by embedding equations
given by one monomial equals another monomial. since the quadric (2.1) cannot have
such a description in p4 without a change in its degree, we conclude that this is not a
toric variety.

we thus limit ourselves to the q and m cases.

2.1 toric description of q111

the rst manifold we describe is the q111, which can be found as the unit circle bundle
inside the l = op1(1)  op1(1)  op1(1) line bundle.

(p1)3 as a toric variety can be described by a fan generated by {e1, e2, e3}. from
the fan, one can simply deduce the matrix describing the combinatorics for this variety

and one can also associate six homogeneous coordinates to this space as described in [21].
in this case they are just the couples of homogeneous coordinates describing the three
projective lines.

line bundles over this space can be described in toric geometry by including a seventh

ane coordinate. the l linebundle is indeed described by the matrix

 .

(2.2)

(2.3)

since q111 is the circle bundle inside this cbundle, it can be retrieved xing the

absolute value of p, e.g. |p|2 = 1.

thus, q111 is the submanifold of the agenerated manifold described by the dterm

equations

|a1|2 + |a2|2 = |b1|2 + |b2|2 = |c1|2 + |c2|2 = 1,

(2.4)

3

and quotiented by the two u(1) actions given by the rst two rows of (2.3)

(a, b, c)  (eia, eib, e2ic),

(a, b)  (eia, eib).

(2.5a)

(2.5b)

it has therefore a description in terms of (s3  s3  s3)/(u(1)  u(1)).

at this point we can also build the invariant coordinates to obtain an explicit embed-
ding of c(q111) inside c8. these coordinates, invariant under the c action described by
(2.3), are

z0 = a1b1c1; z4 = a2b1c1;
z1 = a1b1c2; z5 = a2b1c2;
z2 = a1b2c1; z6 = a2b2c1;
z3 = a1b2c2; z7 = a2b2c2;

and a set of embedding equations is thus given by

(2.6)

(2.7)

z0z5 = z1z4,
z2z7 = z3z6,
z0z3 = z1z2,
z4z7 = z5z6.



we would like to point out here that these can be viewed as the equations dening
q111 in p7 and that they are simply the equations for the segre embedding (p1)3  p7.
c(q111) is then the ane cone over the projectively embedded variety.

in this description, rsymmetry corresponds to pcoordinate rotations. since we can
use the last row u(1) action to gaugex p = 1, choosing an appropriate gauge for the
remaining u(1)s, we can deduce the rsymmetry charges of the various coordinate elds.
this shows that not all the coordinates have the same charges and therefore some of them
must be composite states of the fundamental elds.

2.2 toric description of m 110

as we have just done for the q111 manifold, we can give an analogous description of
the m 110 manifold as the circle bundle inside the canonical line bundle l = op2(3) 
op1(2)  p2  p1.

repeating the construction of the last section, p2p1 as a toric variety can be described
by a fan generated by {e1, e2, (e1+e2), e3}. from this, one can again deduce the matrix
encoding the combinatorics for this variety and describe the linebundle l as

the m 110 manifold is the horizon described by

|u1|2 + |u2|2 + |u3|2 = 3,

|v1|2 + |v2|2 = 2,

(2.10)

and quotiented by the u(1)action

(u, v )  (e2iu, e3iv ).

(2.11)

we can see that this horizon has a description as (s5  s3)/u(1), with the (2.11) u(1)
action. this corresponds exactly to the one given in [12] for a generic m pq0, where it is
seen as a (s5  s3)/u(1) manifold with the u(1) action identifying the bundles of the
type (e2i q u, e3i p v ).

and the embedding equations in c30, which we will not specify here.

3 c4/ orbifold singularities

the essential idea behind the construction of eective eld theories for dbranes (at
singularities) is that the elds describing their degrees of freedom are related to funda-
mental strings stretched between the branes. this is indeed how the right gauge group
and superpotential is chosen.

this cannot surely happen for the fundamental objects in mtheory: the m2branes.
the picture just described is no longer valid since there are no strings in the eleven
dimensional theory.

the way to overcome this obstacle is to think of mtheory as the strongcoupling limit
of type iia string theory. if this is allowed, then one can try to nd the corresponding
tendimensional conguration and see how to describe the low energy eective eld theory
for this latter. it has been shown [22] that m2branes at orbifold singularities arise as
a particular phase in the diagram describing a more complex situation where one has to
deal with d2branes of type iia theory localized onto d6branes, localized or smeared
m2branes and various other eldtheory phases.

in particular, if one studies n2 d2branes over n6 d6branes, when n6  n2, the

eective description is that of m2branes at an an61 singularity c2/zn6.

the fact that one obtains such a singularity can be understood by the supergravity
solution representing these d2branes localized within d6brane in the decoupling limit
[23]. this solution is given by a minkowski space m (10,1) (with one direction compactied)
with zn6 identications over four dimensions. if we call  the n6th root of unity and we

5

complexify the four real dimensions on which we make the identication, the identication
we have to perform is

(z1, z2)  ( z1,  z2).

(3.1)

this kind of action means that we have a gorenstein canonical singularity only if n6 = 2
and thus we have to restrict ourselves to orbifold singularities of the form

c4

z2   .

according to what we have just said, the z2 action must be chosen to be (, , +, +) while
the  action must be of the form (a1, +, a2, a3) because this is the only action leading
to a gorenstein canonical singularity, and compatible with a consistent compactication
down to ten dimensions.

given these restrictions and limiting the analysis to cyclic groups, we have found only
two classes of gorenstein canonical singularities of the form3 c4/(z2  ) satisfying the
above requirements. these are given by

c4

z2  z2m

and

c4

z2  z2m  z2m

,

(3.2)

with m  2. the rst is chosen with an action given by g1 = (, , +, +) and g2 =
(, +, m1, ); the second with action g1 = (, , +, +), g2 = (2m1, +, , +) and
g3 = (2m1, +, +, ), with  the 2mth root of the unity.

the toric data for the c4/(z2  z2m) orbifold can be deduced by one of the recipes

3a recent paper [26] studies a singularity of the form c4

/(z2  z2  z2) with action given by
g1 = (, , +, +), g2 = (, +, , +) and g3 = (, +, +, ). but this means that one has to quotient c4
also by the composite generator g1g2g3 = (, , , ) which has exactly the form of the quotient c4
/z2.
this is known to be a terminal singularity and thus admits no calabiyau resolutions.

6

this simple matrix allows us to see that there are no interesting resolutions of this
singularity (for any m) leading to the c(q111) or c(m 110) cones. we can nd partial
resolutions giving some of the lower dimensional singularities described in [9], like the
conifold (2 = 0 or 3 = 0), the suspended pinch point (2 = 0 and 3 = 0) and the z2
orbifold singularities (2 + 3 = 0). all these imply that now c4/ is at least reduced to
c  c3/.

this reveals to be the right choice to obtain the desired conifold resolution. the cone
over the q111 manifold (2.3) can indeed be obtained by partially resolving this singularity4
keeping 2  3 = 0 and 4 = 0. we recognize in these two rows

again, we can nd many c  c3/ singularities such as the conifolds, the z2 orbifolds
and the suspended pinch points. the still missing resolution is the one leading to c(m 110).
it seems that the only way to nd such a partial resolution is to look at congurations of
m2branes at singularities which do not admit a tendimensional description.

4 some comments on the gauge theories

now that we have outlined the dterms and resolutions necessary to obtain the c(q111)
conifold from an orbifold, we would like to derive the gauge theory by resolving the

4in [24] c(q111) was obtained from the resolution of c2/z2c2/z2, but this is a reducible singularity
and thus any blowup leads also to reducible resolutions. we notice that c(q111) is irreducible since such
are its dening equations [25].

7

orbifold gauge theory. as already said, for dbranes in tendimensional string theory
the orbifold theory is derived from the theory on the smooth covering space by a suitable
projection, and the charge matrices we have used to nd the resolutions tell us which
elds have to acquire a vev.

unfortunately, in our case, the only information we can can have is about which is the
correct orbifold to partially solve, but the derivation of the eld theory has to be found
in a more indirect way.

we have to perform a double projection, the rst to quotient the smooth c4 to c4/z2
and the second to derive the c4/(z2) we are to study. the rst step is accomplished by
passing from the elevendimensional system of m2branes at a c2/z2 singularity to the
tendimensional one, involving d2branes on two d6branes. this yields automatically
the projected theory, with no need to perform the projection by hand.

depending on the  chosen, we will have to study the eld theory describing the low
energy limit of nk (where k = ||) d2branes over two d6branes. we will choose the
d2branes to lie in the x1, x2 directions, while the d6branes will be stretched in the
x1, . . . , x6 directions. once reduced to such a conguration in ten dimensions,  will act
on the x3, . . . , x8 directions with the proper action.

the coordinates transverse to the d6branes are nondynamical degrees of freedom
as seen from the d2branes point of view.
if we call indeed g3 the eective coupling
constant for the elds on the d2 and g7 that for the ones on the d6branes, these have
to be related by

g2
3 =

g2
7
v3456

,

where v3456 is the d6 volume transverse to the d2brane. now, sending v  , the
kinetic energy of these elds explodes to innity and thus they have to be treated as
classical degrees of freedom frozen at a specic value.

ij ( = 0, 1, 2) and the transverse coordinates uctuations i

on the d2branes there lives an n = 8 gauge theory, whose content is given by the
gauge eld a
ij (i = 3, . . . , 9)
sitting in the adjoint of u(nk). this is exactly the same superconformal eld theory which
lives on an m2brane placed on at space [27]. there we had a theory with eight scalars,
but it is easily seen that in three dimensions one can dualize one of these scalars to obtain
a vector eld. since these d2branes are placed onto two d6branes, supersymmetry is
broken down to n = 4 and the i
ij have to be split in those of the new vector multiplets
(a

ij, 7
these are not the only elds living on the d2branes. we also have to consider the
strings stretched among the d2 and d6branes. these carry a u(nk) color and a u(2)
avour index and, from the threedimensional point of view, they can be seen as quark

ij and 9

ij) and those of the hypermultiplets (x 34

ij , x 56

ij ).

ij, 8

elds qia and eqi a (where a  2  u(2)f l.r and a  2).

we could then write the superpotential for such a theory as it is derived from the
treelevel stringy interactions. this theory will then be the superconformal eld theory

8

describing the lowenergy limit of a system of nk m2branes placed at the c2/z2 orbifold
singularity.

we chose nk and not simply n branes, because now we want to perform the projection

needed to obtain the theory on c4/(z2  ).

at this point indeed, if we choose g   and denote its actions on c4 and on the chan
paton factors by r(g) and s(g) respectively, we can determine which are the surviving
elds for the projected theory. the surviving components [6] of the gauge eld a will be
the ones for which

and the surviving scalars must satisfy

a

ij = (s(g)as1(g))ij

i
x i

ij = ri
ij = ri

j(g)(s(g)js1(g))ij,
j(g)(s(g)x js1(g))ij.

(4.1)

(4.2)

we also have to consider the quark elds q and eq which are again to be projected

under the  action. this means that we will keep only the components invariant under

qia = (s(g)q)ia,

eqi a = (eqs1(g))i a.

(4.3)

one then has to substitute the surviving elds into the n = 4 super yangmills
theory describing the d2d6 system. we already discussed which would be the datness
conditions for the unprojected theory, we thus have to add the f atness conditions which
now arise from solving the equations deriving from the minimization of the superpotential
under its variation over the moduli elds (, x).

all these conditions together allow to derive the complete theory, while the geometric
informations of section two are not sucient to completely determine the gauge theory.
here we limit ourselves to the above considerations leaving to a future work the exact
computation of the scft lagrangian and possibly the extension of what just said to
n = 1 or n = 3 cases.

our hope is that such constructions could bring us to the experimental test of the
ads/cft correspondence through the (ads masses)/(cf t weights) relations following
the lines of [28], since the kaluza klein spectrum on such manifolds can be completely
determined and it is actually under computation.

it is a pleasure for me to thank a. arsie and b. greene for many
acknowledgements.
fruitful suggestions and, with a. ceresole, for useful comments on a preliminary version
of this paper. i would also like to thank r. dauria and s. ferrara for helpful discussions
