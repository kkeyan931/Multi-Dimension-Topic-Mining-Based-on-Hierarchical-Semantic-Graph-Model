(10) thus, nite gauge transformation u becomes linear . special feature submanifold dened (2). thus parameterization su(3) terms single real octet vector achieved (9). shown macfarlane, sudbery weisz  special unitary matrix u written exp(ia) hermitian = aa, written u = u0 + iuaa, ua = aa + bdabcbc, u0, a, b functions two su(3) invariants, aa dabcabc. choice, invariants taken constants 1 1 3 gives (9) u. relate u rotation matrix subgroup rotations eight dimensional euclidean space e8. 6 now, consider nite gauge transformation due u (9). 2 nite gauge transformation, know gauge eld = aa transforms au = 1 (u)u1 + u u1. (11) check notation factors, nd innitesimal version (11) using (7), aa = dac c, (12) be. view (1), aa gauge transformations (9) (10), also = 0, i.e., = 0. want show nite au = a, (13) aa satisfying (1). shall make use standard relations among f tensors , viz., f imdmjk + f jmdimk + f klmdijm = 0, f ijmf km = 2 3 (ikj ijk) + dikmdjm djkmdim. (14) (15) starting (9), (u)u1 = (a)a( + bb) = (a)a + i(a)bf abcc + (a)bdabcc, (16) (a)a = 0, following rst relation (2) used. also, second relation (2) gives dabc(b)c = 1 23 (a), (17) 7 (u)u1 = ( + 1 23 )(a)a + i(a)bf abcc. (18) interested transformation aa using (1) (18), satisfying (1) (u)u1 = ( + 1 23 )f abcbac + i(f apqpaq )bf abcc. (19) using (15) simplifying f apqf abc, (19) becomes (u)u1 = ( + 1 23 aa + i{ dqbadpcapbaq 2 3 c}, relations (2) used. 2 3 )f abcbac bcab c + 1 3 dqcaaq c (20) now, consider evaluation uau1 using (9). uau1 = ( + aa) ab b 2 ( + cc), ( + aa) {b + bcd cd + 1 2 = + dbcd cd}ab , 2 3 b (21) using (8). expanding using (8), uau1 = 1 2{b + bcdcd + 2 3 b + dbcdcd + a(if abcc + 2 3 ab + dabcc) + bcdca(if adee + ad + dadee) 2 3 + 2 3 aba + dbcdac(if adee + 8 2 3 ad + dadee)}ab .
