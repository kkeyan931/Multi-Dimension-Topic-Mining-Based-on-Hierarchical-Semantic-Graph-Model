abstract

the graviton exchange diagram for the correlation function of arbitrary scalar operators
is evaluated in antide sitter space, adsd+1. this enables us to complete the computation
of the 4point amplitudes of dilaton and axion elds in iib supergravity on ads5  s5.
by the ads/cft correspondence, we obtain the 4point functions of the marginal operators
tr(f 2 + . . .) and tr(f f + . . .) in n = 4, d = 4 su (n ) sym at large n, large g2
y m n.
the short distance asymptotics of the amplitudes are studied. we nd that in the direct
channel the leading power singularity agrees with the expected contribution of the stress
energy tensor in a double ope expansion. logarithmic singularities occur in the complete
4point functions at subleading orders.

1 introduction

the calculation of correlation functions is one useful way to test and explore the ads/cft corre-
spondence [1, 2, 3], which relates ddimensional conformal eld theories with compactications
of string/m theory involving adsd+1. the simplest example of the correspondence is the du-
ality between n = 4, d = 4 su(n) sym theory and type iib string theory on ads5  s5
2 . in the large n
with n units of 5form ux and compactication radius r2 =  (g2
y m n xed and large the supergravity approximation is valid. correlators of
limit with  = g2
gauge invariant local operators in the cft at large n and strong thooft coupling  are related to
supergravity amplitudes according to the prescription of [2, 3]. the 5dimensional newton con-
stant g5  r3/n 2, so that the perturbative expansion in supergravity, if ultraviolet convergent,
corresponds to the 1/n expansion in the cft.

broadly speaking, 2 and 3point functions (see e.g. [4, 5, 6]) have provided evidence that
the conjectured correspondence is correct, but 4point functions are expected to contain more
information about the non-perturbative dynamics of the cft. previous studies relevant to 4point
correlators include [7][19]. 4point correlators for contact interactions of scalars in the bulk
theory were the rst to be studied [7, 8, 9] followed by diagrams with exchanged gauge bosons
[10] and scalars [11, 12, 13]. (see also [14, 15] for a different approach). /r2 corrections are
considered in [16], and there is an extensive literature on instanton contributions, see e.g. [17].

the simplest 4point correlators that can be studied are those involving the marginal op-
erators o  tr(f 2 + . . .) and oc  tr(f f + . . .) corresponding to the dilaton and axion
supergravity elds, as rst stressed in [8]. to leading order in n, the amplitudes hooooi,
hococococi and hoocooci factorize in products of 2point functions (see figures 1a
and 3). thanks to the nonrenormalization theorem for the 2point functions [20, 4], these dis-
connected contributions do not receive corrections in powers of /r2 = 1/1/2. the next con-
tribution to the 4point amplitudes is thus a 1/n 2 effect and involves treelevel, connected super-
gravity diagrams like the ones in figure 2. the computation of hooooi, hococococi
and hoocooci was started in [9] with the evaluation of the relevant quartic and scalar ex-
change diagrams (figure 2s,u,q and figure 4). here we complete the computation by evaluating
the remaining graviton exchange diagram (figure 2t) and we initiate the analysis of the rst
realistic 4point amplitude in the ads/cft correspondence.

we also present what we believe is a crosschecked and reliable calculation of the graviton
exchange diagram between pairs of external scalars of arbitrary mass in adsd+1 for arbitrary d.
the calculation was facilitated by the recently derived covariant form of the graviton propagator

[21], but it is still very complex compared to earlier work.

one theoretical framework to analyze results on 4point functions in the operator product
expansion (ope) [11, 22]. the mere assumption of an ope is quite restrictive and imposes
constraints on the allowed form of the result. let us assume a double tchannel ope of the
schematic form

ho1(x1)o2(x2)o3(x3)o4(x4)i = xn,m

n hon(x1)om(x2)i m

(x1  x3)1+3m(x2  x4)2+4n

(1.1)

containing the contribution of various primary operators op and their descendents kop in the
intermediate state. for simplicity we have assumed that these are scalars, but vector and tensor
operators contribute in a similar way, each with a characteristic tensor structure. (for primary
operators, hopopi vanishes unless p = p).

recognizing in the supergravity 4point results a structure of the form (1.1) should allow to
determine the operator content of the theory and its ope structure in the large n, large  limit.
preliminary computations [11, 12] have indicated that the supergravity diagrams contain the
expected contributions to (1.1) of chiral primary operators and their superconformal descendents.
it is however clear that these contributions alone do not reproduce the supergravity result [9]. a
natural expectation is that appropriately dened normalordered products of chiral primaries
and descendents also contribute to the ope and form the full operator content of the theory
in this limit. this set of operators has a dual interpretation in terms of multiparticle kaluza
klein states in supergravity. massive string states are expected to decouple in this limit1. the
computation of a complete realistic 4point correlator presented here should allow to put these
ideas to test.

an interesting issue raised in [9] is the presence in the 4point supergravity amplitudes of
logarithms of the coordinate separation between two points in the limit when the points come
close. logarithmic singularities appear to be a generic feature of all the ads processes studied
so far [10, 12, 13], and we nd the same situation for the graviton exchange. the question
then is whether the logarithms cancel when the various contributions to a realistic correlator are
assembled. if not, we should ask whether the logarithms can still be incorporated in the ope
framework. here we nd that logarithmic singularities do indeed occur in the complete 4point
functions.

as pointed out by witten [23], logarithms can generically arise in the perturbative expan-
sion of a cft 4point correlator as renormalization effects like mixings and corrections to the

1grouptheoretic aspects of multiparticle and string states have been considered in [28].

dimensions of the exchanged operators. the perturbative parameter is in this case 1/n, which
is mapped by the correspondence to the gravitational coupling constant. the operators o and
oc are chiral and hence their dimensions are protected, but their opes contain (besides chiral
contributions like the stressenergy tensor) nonchiral composite operators like : oo : that
require a careful denition and can lead to renormalization effects [23]. (a somewhat different
viewpoint has been described in a very recent paper [24], see also [25]).

it is an interesting subject for future work to analyze the constraints imposed by this inter-
pretation on the allowed form of the logarithmic singularities and to assess the compatibility of
these constraints with the supergravity results.

the paper is organized as follows.
in section 2, we present the supergravity graphs that contribute to 4point functions involv-
ing o, oc, summarize our results for the amplitudes and make some remarks about their ope
interpretation.

in section 3, we describe the general setup for the calculation of the graviton exchange
amplitude. we give a few geometric identities, summarize the results for the scalar and graviton
propagators and present the integral associated with the graviton exchange graph.

in section 4 and section 5 we separately describe two independent computations of the
graviton amplitude, for  =  = d = 4 in section 4 and for general ,  and d in section
5. both computations reduce the graviton exchange amplitude to nite sums of scalar quartic
graphs (see figure 6). the two results are shown to precisely agree for  =  = d = 4.

in section 6, we develop integral representations and asymptotic series expansions for the
quartic graphs (figure 5), which are the basic building blocks of the answer. we nd asymptotic
serieses for the graviton exchange in terms of two conformally invariant variables.

finally, in the appendix we discuss some properties and mathematical identities of the quar-

tic graphs.

2 4point functions in the dilatonaxion sector

following [8], we rst discuss the dilatonaxiongraviton sector of iib supergravity, dimension-
ally reduced on the classical background solution ads5  s5 keeping only the constant modes
on s5. the relevant part of 5dimensional action is2

th 5dimensional gravitational coupling  is related to the parameters of the compactication
by 22 = 153r3
, where n is the number of units of 5form ux and r the radius of the 5sphere
(equal to the ads5 scale, see equ.(3.16) below). we will usually set the ads5 scale r  1.

2.1 witten diagrams

we wish to implement the prescription of [2, 3] to compute the cft correlators hoocooci,
hooooi, hococococi, where o  tr(f 2 + ...), oc  tr(f f + ...) are the exactly
marginal ( = 4) sym operators corresponding to the dilaton and axion elds [3]3.

let us rst consider ho(x1)oc(x2)o(x3)oc(x4)i. the leading large n contribution is
given by the disconnected diargam in figure 1a. this diagram, being the product of two 2point
functions, is proportional to n 4/(x8

13x8

24).

2the metric appearing in (2.1) is not the restriction of the original 10dimensional metric to ads5, but it is
 that gives the massless
, where  is an index along s5 and

related to it by a weyl rescaling of the metric uctuations [26, 8]. the uctuation h
graviton in ads5 is given in terms of the original h by h = h
g the background metric [26].

3the precise structure of the composite operators o and oc in terms of elementary sym elds is in principle
given by the variation of the onshell n = 4 lagrangian with respect to the marginal couplings gy m and , or by
supersymmetry transformations starting from the chiral primary trx (ix j).

the next contribution, of order n 2, comes from the diagrams in figures 1b and 2. however,
the oneloop diagrams in figure 1b, thanks to the fact that the dimensions of the chiral operators
o,oc are protected, only give a 1/n 2 correction to the overall coefcient of the amplitude in
figure 1a4. among the diagrams in figure 2, the sum s+u+q has been computed in [9].

sections 4 and 5 of the paper are devoted to evaluation of the remaining graviton exchange

diagram t.

similarly, figures 3 and 4 reproduce the relevant diagrams for hoc(x1)oc(x2)oc(x3)oc(x4)i.

the connected diagrams for ho(x1)o(x2)o(x3)o(x4)i involve only graviton exchanges.
as shown in [9] the s,t,u scalar exchange diagrams in figure 4 add up to zero. hence, to this
order,

hooooi = hococococi.

(2.2)

4this correction precisely accounts for the fact the gauge group is su (n ) rather than u (n ). note that va-
lidity of the correspondence seems to require that there are no higher loop corrections in the supergravity 2point
functions.

2.2 summary of results

it turns out that upon integration over one of the bulk points, all 4point ads processes with
external scalars, including the graviton exchange, reduce to a nite sum of scalar quartic graphs
(see figure 6). we denote quartic graphs of external conformal dimensions i with the symbol
d1324(x1, x3, x2, x4), as in figure 5 (see equation (a.1) for the precise denition and the
appendix for a discussion of properties of these functions).

the nal result for the graviton exchange graph in figure 2t as sum of quartic graphs (for

 =  = d = 4), derived in sections 4 and 5 below, is

is obtained by crosssymmetrization of (2.3).

the functions d1324 admit simple integral representations (see section 6.1) and can all
be obtained as derivatives with respect to x2
ij of a single function (see section a.3). in section 6

we now turn to discuss some physical implications of these results.

2.3 ope interpretation

let us compare the singular power terms of (2.7) with those expected form the ope (1.1). in the
direct channel limit |x13|  |x12|, |x24|  |x12| the leading terms of the variables s and t are

(2.11)

where jij = ij  2yiyj/y2 is the wellknown jacobian tensor of the conformal inversion y

(2.12)

igrav(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)sing

with subleading terms suppressed by powers of |x13|/|x12| and |x24|/|x12|. we note from (1.1)
that (2.12) describes the contribution to the ope of an operator op of dimension  = 4. we
show below that the tensorial structure agrees with the the expected contribuion of the stress
energy tensor of the boundary theory. it is worth mentioning rst that various subcontributions
to the amplitude igrav (some of the d functions in (2.3)) have leading power 1/(x6
12)
indicative of a scalar operator of dimension  = 2, which would not be expected in the graviton
exchange process. the fact that this term cancels in the full amplitude is then an important check
of the calculation.

24x4

let us consider a scalar operator o of scaledimension  in ddimensional spacetime.

the contribution of the conserved traceless stresstensor tij to the ope of o(x1)o(x3) is

which is conserved and traceless in any dimension. note that jik(y)jkj(y) = ij. we thus see
that the stress tensor contribution to the general scalar double ope is

(2.15)

this form is in perfect agreement with (2.12). further relevant information on 2 and 3point
functions of the stressenergy tensor can be found in [27].

let us now consider the logarithmic terms. we see from the sum of (2.8) and (2.10) that an
innite series of terms logarithmic in s occurs in the direct channel expansion of hoocooci.
since the serieses (2.8) and (2.10) have a rather different structure, this conclusion appears quite
robust. (in particular, it is insensitive to the relative normalization of igrav and is + iu + iq). we
plead exhaustion and excuse ourselves from carrying a similar analysis for the crossed channel
limit of hoocooci and for hooooi. the reader can nd the necessary ingredients
in section 6.2. as mentioned in the introduction, one should be able to interpret these loga-
rithmic terms as 1/n 2 renormalization effects related to the contribution of composite operators
to the ope (1.1) [23]. for example, the leading logarithmic term in the direct channel limit,
), could be related to the presence in (1.1) of the nonchiral composite opera-
(x12)16 log( x13x24
tors : oo : and : ococ :. it is an interesting topic for future research to precisely identify
the contributions of various composite operators, and the patterns of their renormalization and
mixing, in the intricate series structures (2.8), (2.10). a detailed ope intepretation of these su-
pergravity results should provide us with new nonperturbative information about the n = 4
sym theory.

throughout this paper, we shall also make use of differentiation and contraction relations be-

du u = u(2 + u)

du = g(1 + u)

(du) (d u) = u u

(du) ( u) = (1 + u) u

(du) ( u) = g  + u u .

the propagator for massless scalars, with  = d, is relevant for the graviton. when  = d is an

the graviton propagator [21] can be expressed as a superposition of 5 independent fourth
rank bitensors, of which 2 are gauge independent and 3 are gauge artifacts. the gauge terms
represent pure diffeomorphisms, and their contribution to the integrals in the exchange diagram
vanishes because the stress tensor is conserved. the physical part of the propagator involves two
scalar functions g(u) and h(u), and is given by

g (z, w) = (u  u +  u u) g(u) + g g  h(u)

(3.36)

the function g(u) is equal to the massless scalar propagator gd.

a representation of h(u) as a hypergeometric function was given in [21]. it was also ex-
pressed in terms of g(u) and its rst integral g(u), dened by g(u) = g(u) and the boundary
condition g() = 0, which is a more useful form, given by

 (d  1)h(u) = 2(1 + u)2g(u) + 2(d  2)(1 + u) g(u) .

(3.37)

again, when d is even, h(u) admits an elementary expression; in particular, when d = 4, we
have

h(u) =

3.2 structure of the graviton exchange amplitude

the graviton exchange amplitude associated with the witten diagram of figure 2t is given by

24 (w)

(3.39)

where g  is the graviton propagator (3.36). the vertex factor t 

13 (z) is given by

t 
13 (z) = dk(z, x1)dk(z, x3) + dk(z, x1)dk(z, x3)

(3.40)

g[k(z, x1)dk(z, x3) + m2k(z, x1)k(z, x3)] .

propagator equations (2  m2)k = (2  m2)k = 0.

24 (w) is obtained from (3.40) by replacing x1  x2, x3  x4,   
24 = 0 thanks to the

it is the high tensorial rank of the propagator and vertex factors that make this amplitude
more difcult than previously studied exchanges. the calculation is made tractable by splitting
the amplitude into several terms and using partial integration of derivatives. there are several
ways to organize this process, and what we have done and will present are complete calculations
by two different methods which are then compared and shown to give identical results for the
special case d =  =  = 4, i.e. axions and dilatons in the type iib theory. the two methods
are separately presented in sections 4 and 5.

4 the graviton exchange graph for  =  = d = 4

the graviton propagator involves nontrivial tensorial structures. nevertheless, it turns out that
it is possible to reduce the graviton exchange graph to the sum of purely scalar amplitudes, with
a peculiar pattern of bulktobulk and bulktoboundary scalar propagators. we describe this
reduction in section 4.1.

furthermore, upon integration over one of the two bulk variables, which we carry out in
section 4.2, each effective scalar exchange can be expressed a sum of quartic graphs with appro-
priate external dimensions. the nal answer for the graviton exchange in terms of these basic

building blocks (see figure 6) is given in equation (4.38). the quartic graphs admit asymptotic
series expansion which we describe in section 6. it is also worth mentioning at this point that
each quartic graph can be obtained by taking successive derivatives of a single basic function,
see section a.3.

4.1 reduction to scalar exchanges

we need to compute the graviton exchange amplitude (3.39) for m2 = m2 = 0. using the form
(3.36) for the graviton propagator, we have5 :

we wish to eliminate all the tensor indices and all the derivatives, so that the graviton exchange
is reduced to a sum of effective scalar graphs. with this program in mind, we observe a few
pretty identities. first:

 k(z, x1)  u   k(w, x2) =
2h k(z, x1) k+1(w, x2) k1(z, x2)  k+1(z, x1) k(w, x2) k1(w, x1)

k+1(z, x1) k+1(w, x2) + (1 + u) k(z, x1) k(w, x2)i

+2x2
12

(4.10)

it is simplest to verify this identity by the methods described in [4], where one uses conformal
transformations to go to a coordinate system where point x1 is mapped to innity and point x2
to zero. further:

k+1(z, x1) k1(w, x1) =

inserting twice (4.11) into (4.10) we get:

 k(z, x1)u + (1 + u) k(z, x1)

we now evaluate (4.64.9) one by one.

(4.13)

and inserting twice (4.12) for  = 4 we obtain 16 + 16 terms many of which are related by
a simple symmetrization. below we present the manipulations performed on the inequivalent
terms. we often suppress the coordinate labels, and give the expressions with the propagators in
the following order: (z, x1) , (z, x3) , (w, x2) , (w, x1) unless stated otherwise. referring to the

where the 3 permutations of the second integral are obtained by exchanging (x1, x2)  (x3, x4)
and x1  x3. the formula above can be simplied by explicit application of laplace operator
(3.29) and using the equations obeyed by g and h given in section 3.1. we get

(4.27)

the last two terms in this expression arise from delta functions generated by the application of
the laplace operator7. in particular the last term comes from:

z [dz dw] k4 k4 2(z, w) k4 k4
= 2z [dw] k4 k4  k4 k4 = 2z [dw] k4 k4(cid:16)16 k4 k4  32x2

k5 k5(cid:17) (4.28)

where in the last equality we have used (a.5).

4.2 reduction to quartic graphs

we rst observe the identity

z u

g = g3 + (1 + u)g ,

(4.29)

where g3 is a scalar propagator of m2 = 3, corresponding to a boundary conformal dimension
 = 3:

7the coordinate dependence of the ks is: (w, x1), (w, x3), (w, x2), (w, x4).

 (2 + 3)g3 = (z, w) .

(4.30)

17

using (4.29), we see that the complete graviton graph (4.27) involves effective scalar exchanges
of the form

1324  z [dz dw] k1

plus some quartic interactions (last line of (4.27)).

k3 (1 + u)pg5

(4.31)

we now proceed to derive a general formula to perform the z integration in (4.31), following
the methods developed in [13]. quite remarkably, upon integration over z, (4.31) reduces to a
nite sum of effective quartic graphs, see figure 6.

translating x1  0 and performing conformal inversion (see [4] for a detailed account), we

can write

i 5,p

1324 = |x31|23|x21|22|x41|24z [dw]r(w x

(4.33)

as compared to [13] we allow the bulk propagator to be multiplied by (1 + u)p (see (3.33.4)
in [13]). we now use the hypergeometric series expansion (3.33).
inserting this series into
the expression for r5,p
1,3, we can perform the z integral term by term by a standard feynman
parameterization, and resum the resulting series. we get
2(5  p + 3  1)][ 1

the graviton amplitude (3.39) is symmetric under x1  x3 and x2  x4. these symmetries are
explicit in the nal expression for igrav, indeed some of the d functions (of the form d  )
are symmetric by themselves, while asymmetric d functions appear in all the symmetric permu-
tations. it turns out that thanks to the remarkable properties of the d functions (see equ. (a.11)),
the answer can be rewritten in terms of d  s alone. introducing the conformal invariant

the graviton amplitude (3.39) is, for the case  =  = 4 that we are considering, also sym-
metric under (x1, x3)  (x2, x4). although not immediately manifest in the expression above,
this symmetry is actually present thanks to the identity (a.11) obeyed by the d functions.

5 general graviton exchange graph

we expect that the amplitudes for graviton exchange between massive scalars will be useful in
general studies of the ads/cft correspondence. as in past work [10, 13] we therefore assume
initially that d, , and  are arbitrary, constrained only by the unitarity bound ,   d/2. we
will assume integer values at the point where this step simplies the calculation, and specialize
still later to the case d =  =  = 4 to present detailed asymptotic formulas for dilatons and
axions in the type iib supergravity.

the rst step in the evaluation of the amplitude (3.39) is to split it into contributions from the
terms in h(u) and g(u) in the graviton propagator, and to split the latter into a term proportional
to the metric g in t 

13 (z) of (3.40) plus the remaining term, viz.

igrav =

1
4

agrav =

the three contributions are then given by

(ah + ag

s + ag

t ).

s = z dzgz dwg[k(1)dk(3) + m2k(1)k(3)](z) i (z, w) t  
t = 2z dzgz dwgk(1)k(3) dud u g(u) t  
ah = z dzgz dwg g  t13(z) h(u) g  t24(w)

where we use the abbreviation g  t = gt , and

24 (w)

24 (w) + (1  3)

i   gg(u)[dud u + d udu]

= 2g(u)(g  + u u) .

(5.4)

(5.5)

where (3.27) is used to obtain the second line in (5.5). the symmetrization in 1  3 in (5.3)
will be useful for later steps.

the w-integral in as

g that involves the tensor u u of (5.5) may be simplied by using

ug(u) =  g(u), integrating by parts in w and using the covariant conservation of t24,

z dwgg(u)u ut  

24 (w) = z dwg g(u) d u t  

24 (w)

20

putting together this rearrangement of the ag

s part, we have

= z dwg (1 + u) g(u) g  t24(w)

ag

s = z dzgz dwg[k(1)dk(3) + m2k(1)k(3)](z)

{2g(u) + 2(1 + u) g(u)} g  t24(w)

(5.6)

(5.7)

next, we use the propagator equations (2  m2)k(1) = (2  m2)k(3) = 0 to obtain the
following identity

[k(1)dk(3) + m2k(1)k(3)](z) =

1
2

2z{k(1)k(3)}(z)

(5.8)

substituting this identity into ag
boundary terms and using (3.29), we nd

s , integrating by parts the operator 2z, neglecting vanishing

2z{(1 + u) g(u)} = 2g(u) + 4(1 + u)2g(u) + 2d(1 + u) g(u)

(5.9)

which then gives

ag

s = z dzgz dwgk(1)k(3){2zg(u)  2g(u) + 4(1 + u)2g(u)

+2d(1 + u) g(u)} g  t24(w)

(5.10)

before simplifying the g  t24 factor in the integrand, we rst treat ag
t and ah in a similar
manner. for ah, we use again (5.8) to simplify the z-integration and to cast it in the following
form

ah = z dzgz dwg k(1)k(3){

1
2

(d  1)2zh(u)  2m2h(u)} g  t24(w)

(5.11)

to simplify ag

t , we begin with partial integration of  in the z-integral in (5.3), and split

ag

t as follows

where

t = 2ag
ag

t 1  2ag

t 2

ag

ag

t 1 = z dzgz dwg{k(1)k(3)}d[dud ug(u)] t  
t 2 = z dzgz dwgdk(1)k(3)[dud ug(u)]t  

24 (w)

24 (w) + (1  3) .

(5.12)

(5.13)

(5.14)

t 1 may be simplied by working out the tensor algebra using (3.233.27) and again

now, ag
 ug(u) =   g(u) to obtain

d[dud ug(u)] = d( . . .) + d ( . . .)  du g j(u)

j(u) = (1 + u)g(u) + (d + 1) g(u)

(5.15)

21

the terms with d and d  cancel by partial integration in (5.13) by conservation of t24 finally,

integrating by parts once more in  and using du j(u) = dr u j, we get the following

simple result for ag
t 1,

ag

t 1 = z dzgz dwg{k(1)k(3)}du j(u) g  t24(w)

= z dzgz dwgk(1)k(3){u(2 + u)j (u) + (d + 1)(1 + u)j(u)} g  t24(w)

(5.16)

it is more difcult to deal with ag

t 2 to simplify the integral representation in (5.14), it is
very convenient to set x1 = 0 in the rst term and then perform an inversion transformation of
the integral (in z and w) as explained in [4]. the symmetric step in 1  3 is done later. it is
now easy to evaluate the double covariant derivative of the inverted bulk-to-boundary propagator
0 ,
k(1) = cz

dk(1) = k(1)g + ( + 1)k(1)z2

0g0g0

(5.17)

the contribution of the rst term in (5.17) is proportional to the metric g, and may be
s . it acquires an effective scalar propagator propor-

treated by the same technique used for ag
tional to the term in {. . .} in (5.7). we thus nd for this contribution to ag

the integral of the second term in (5.17) contains the factor.

0g0g0du d u = (z0g0 + u)(z0g 0 +  u)

(5.19)

integration in w against g(u)t  

24 (w) gives rise to three types of terms

z dwg (1 + u) g(u) g  t24(w).

24 (w)

(5.20)

the second integral on the right hand side may be further simplied by using once more  ug(u) =
  g(u), integrating by parts, using conservation of t24 and being careful to taking into account
the fact that the integral is the 0 component of a vector instead of a scalar. thus there is a
non-vanishing contribution of christoffel symbols, which gives

5.1 final simplied form

we are now in a position to assemble all contributions to the graviton exchange diagram by
combining results for ah, ag

(5.27)

the relation between h(u) and g(u) was given in (3.37) and may be used to further simplify
the form of p (u). while both 2zg and 2zh have a term proportional to (z, w), the relative
coefcients of both terms are such that this -functions cancels out of the full p (u), and we are
left with

p (u) = 2g  2u(2 + u)g + 2(2  d  1)(1 + u) g(u)  m2h(u)

5.2 general integrals over interaction points

we shall use the following strategy for the calculation of the integrals over the interaction points
31; by
z and w in the reduced amplitudes of (5.245.26). first, we shift both z and w by x
31 and
translation invariance, the integrals depend only upon the new variables x  x
41  x
31. the z-integrations then only depend upon the variable w, and may be carried out
y  x
explicitly in terms of elementary functions by methods similar to the ones used in [10] and [13].
only after the z-integrals are carried out are the explicit forms of g  t24 and t24(w)00 required
and used. the remaining w-integrals may be recast as integral representations that admit simple
asymptotic expansions.

21  x

to prepare for the zintegrations, we note that p (u) in (5.24)) and (5.28) involves the in-
variant function g(u) and its rst integral g(u), and the same functions appear in (5.25,5.26).
to apply the methods of [10] and [13] we need the series expansions of g(u) and g(u) in the
variable  of (3.32). for g(u) this is just the hypergeometric series for gd(u) in (3.33) and we
obtain the series for g(u) by direct integration. these expansions are given by

g(u) =

these series expansions are uniformly convergent inside any disc || < 1. the normalization
constant may be read off from (3.34) and (3.31) for  = d, and we nd cg = 2d d cd.

there are ve independent z-integrals required to evaluate the graviton exchange amplitudes.

they are as follows,

z1(w) = z dzg k(1)k(3)g(u)

24

(5.31)

z2(w) = z dzg k(1)k(3)(1 + u)2g(u)
z3(w) = z dzg k(1)k(3)(1 + u) g(u)

it remains to evaluate the z-integrals.

5.2.1

performing the z-integrals

the z-integrations are carried out term by term on the series expansions of (5.30), and all the

in the integrals zj(w) of (5.315.35), the values taken by (a, b) are (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), ( 1
2, 1
2)
and (1, 0) for j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively. the calculation of the z-integrals is slightly involved,
but is essentially the same for each of the zj-integrals. here, we shall present in detail only the
calculation for z1, and restrict to presenting the nal results for the remaining 4 integrals.

to compute z1(w), we use the expansion of (5.30) for the function g(u) and integrate term
by term in z using the integral formula of (5.39), here with a = b = 0. assembling these
results, we notice that the factors (k + d
2 ) cancel between numerators and
denominators. also, interchanging the order of the -integration of (5.39) and the k-sum of

2) and (k + d

2 + 1

assuming that d is even and d  4 throughout, we have p > 1 and the function f;p may be

(5.41)

in view of the presence of the multiple derivative operation in front, we are free to add into the

f;p() =  p(cid:18) d

(5.42)

be carried out explicitly. the nal result is

as in the special case  =  = d = 4 already discussed in section 3, we recognize that the
general graviton exchange amplitude is a nite sum of quartic graphs. in fact, each w 
k (a, b)
is the amplitude of a 4point contact diagram evaluated in the inverted coordinates (with ap-
propriate inversion prefactors omitted). the scale dimension of the external propagators are
1 = k + 2a  b, 3 = k, 2 =  + b and 4 =  (see equ.(a.3)).
5.3 graviton exchange graph for d =  =  = 4

for  =  = d = 4, the masses of the scalars vanish m = m = 0, and the k and -sums
in the results for the z-integral functions ij truncate after just a few terms. we need the z-
integral functions zj(w), j = 1,   , 5, which may be read off from (5.45) and (5.485.52) with

the full graviton amplitude igrav is obtained by multiplying b by the appropriate kinematic
factors and symmetrizing under 1  3 (see (5.1), (5.23)).
5.4 equivalence with the result in section 3

we now make contact with the result obtained in section 4. we recall that w 
k (a, b) are just
scalar quartic graphs in the inverted coordinates (with some kinematic factors omitted), see
equ.(a.3). one can easily convert (5.69) and (5.23) into the notations section 4, and get a
sum of dfunctions. the representation of the graviton exchange graph that is obtained in
this way does not at rst appear to coincide with the result (4.38). in particular, terms of the
form x2
p (1, 0) in (5.69) and its symmetrization in
1  3. thanks to the many identities that connect the d functions (see the appendix), the

two representations of the answer are in fact exactly equal. we rst use (a.19) to eliminate the

now (4.38), (5.70) are both in terms of dfunctions of the form d  . by repeated applica-
tion of (a.9) one can convert one representation into the other. we regard this nontrivial match
as a strong check of our result.

6 asymptotic expansions

we have seen that the graviton exchange amplitude (and generically all ads 4point processes
with external scalars) can be expressed as a nite sum of quartic graphs, see (4.38), (5.575.58),
(5.70). in this section we develop asymptotic series expansions for the scalar quartic graphs
(figure 5) in terms of conformally invariant variables. this series expansions allow to analyze
in section 3 and 4 we
the supergravity results in terms of the expected double ope (1.1).
p (a, b).
have used slightly different notations for the quartic graphs, namely d1324 and w 
the connection between the two is given in (a.3). here the expansions are performed for the
w 

p (a, b) representation of the quartic graph.
in section 6.3 we assemble the series expansions of the w s that appear in the representation
(5.23,5.69) of the graviton exchange for  =  = d = 4. we concentrate on the direct channel
and display explicitly the singular terms and all the logarithmic contributions. the complete
expansions, in both direct and crossed channels, can be easily obtained from the formulas in
section 6.2.

6.1 integral representations of w 

k (a, b)

to evaluate w 
k (a, b), we follow the methods of [10] and [13]. we introduce a rst feynman
parameter  for the denominators w2 and (w  x)2 and a second feynman parameter  for the
resulting denominator and (w  y)2. the ~w and w0 integrals may then be carried out using

now the function w with b 6= 0 only enters the calculation of b00 (equ.(5.67)), and appears
there only in the form of the sum w 
k (1, 1). this particular combination may be
reexpressed in terms of w -functions with b = 0 only. this would be difcult to see from the
w-integral denition (5.53), but is manifest from the integral representation (6.3), by using the
following relation

the w-integrals w

two universal functions. to show this, we proceed as in [10] and [13], where analogous results
were obtained for the scalar and gauge exchange graphs. we begin by introducing the conformal

6.2 series expansions of w 

k (a, b)

series expansions of the functions w 
k (a, 0) may be obtained easily from the series expansions
of the universal functions ia(s, t). there are two different regions in which the expansion will
be needed :

a) the direct channel (tchannel) limit |x13|  |x12|, |x24|  |x12|, which corre-
sponds to s, t  0.
b) the two crossed channels; one (schannel) is the limit |x12|  |x13|, |x34| 
|x13|, which corresponds to s  1/2, t  1, and the other (uchannel) is
|x23|  |x34|, |x14|  |x34| in which s  1/2, t  1.

we shall now discuss each limit in turn.
(a) direct channel series expansion

the direct channel limit is given by s, t  0, and the expansions of the functions ia(s, t) are

given by

i0(s, t) =

i1(s, t) =





xk=0{ ln s ak(t) + bk(t)}sk
xk=0{ ln s ak(t) + bk(t)}sk+2

where the coefcient functions are given by

ak(t) = z 1
ak(t) = z 1

(6.15)

(6.16)

(6.17)

(6.18)

the coefcient functions admit taylor series expansions in powers of t with radius of conver-
gence 1. actually, in view of (6.7), we have the following relations between these functions

(k + 2)ak(t) = (k + 1)(2ak(t)  ak+1(t))
(k + 2)2 bk(t) = (k + 1)(k + 2)(2bk(t)  bk+1(t))  2ak(t) + ak+1(t)

(6.19)

(6.20)

from (6.13) and (6.15, 6.16), we obtain the series expansions of w 

k (0, 0) and w 

k (1, 0)

using the following differentiation formulas

sk =

s(cid:19)p

the presentation of these series expansions is slightly formal in the sense that for k   2, the
(k+ 2) function in the denominator produces a zero, while the (k+ 2) term produces
a pole, which together yield a nite result, which amounts to a pole term in s. its coefcient can
be obtained from the formula limx0 (x q)/(x q) = ()q+1(q + 1) for any nonnegative
interger q.
(b) crossed channel series expansion

the crossed channel asymptotics is given by s  1

2 and t  1, and may also be obtained
from the series expansion of the functions ia(s, t), with a = 0, 1. actually, it sufces to obtain
the expansion of i0(s, t) and thus of w 
p (0, 0) in this limit and then to compute the series
expansion of w 
p (1, 0) by using the relation (6.7). this is useful in this case, since the expansion
of i1(s, t) appears more involved than that of i0(s, t).

we start from the denition of i0(s, t) in (6.14) as a double integral and consecutively per-

form the following changes of variables  = (1 + t) and  = (1 + )1, so that

i0(s, t) = z 1

(6.25)

this form of the universal function i0(s, t) is now precisely of the form studied in [13], and the
-integral may be performed explicitly in an elementary way. we obtain, as in [13]

where

i0(s, t) = i log

where the composite variable  is dened by  = 1  (1  2s)(1   ). in the neighborhood

of s = 1
both uniformly convergent, and may be taylor expanded in powers of (2s  1) and (1  t2).
thus, i reg

non-analyticity is contained in the factor ln(1  t2) of i log

properties of d1324

we have seen that a basic building block in expressing the 4point functions is the quantity
d1324, dened by

k1(z, x1) k3(z, x3) k2(z, x2) k4(z, x4)

(a.1)

d1324(x1, x3, x2, x4) = z dd+1z

zd+1
0

where k(z, x) is

k(z, x) =  

z0

0 + (~z  ~x)2!

z2

.

(a.2)

(note the different normalization from k(z, x), equ.(3.31)). thus d1324 corresponds to a
quartic interaction between scalars of dimension i, with a simple nonderivative interaction
vertex, see figure 5. note that sometimes we suppress the explicit coordinate dependence of the
d functions. coordinate labels are always understood to be in the order (x1x3x2x4).

while the result of the computation of the graviton exchange graph gives a sum of many
different d functions, in fact all these functions are closely related to each other. we show
that one can relate d1324 to d113124 and d132+14+1 (see for example (a.9)).
further, all the d functions can be obtained from differentiating one single expression (which
can be obtained in closed form) with respect to the variables x2
ij. this is shown in section a.3.
using this latter fact we show how for example how d+1  +1 (+ symmetrizing permutations)
can be related easily to expressions of the form d   (see (a.16)). these relations are useful
to arrive at the two simplied forms of the graviton amplitude (4.38) , (5.70) given in the text
and to show their equivalence.

a.1 relation between d1324 and w 

k (a, b)

the standard integral introduced in (5.53) is just a quartic graph evaluated in the inverted frame,
with some kinematic factors omitted. the precise relation with d1324 is

w 

k (a, b) = x2k

13 x2

14 x2(+b)

12

d2ab+k, k, +b, 

(a.3)

a.2 derivative vertices

the rst thing we note is that if we have a quartic interaction with derivatives, given by a coupling

1(z) 3(z)


z 2(z)


z 1(z) g ,

(a.4)

37

then the computation of the 4point function with such an interaction can again be reduced to a
sum of terms of the form (a.1). this is done with the identity [9]

g 
z

k(z, x1)


z

thus

k(z, x2) = 12h k1(z, x1) k2(z, x2)

(a.6)

a.3 lowering and raising i

not only does the identity (a.6) allow us to remove derivatives from the quartic vertex, it is also
useful to relate various d functions to each other. let us rewrite the l.h.s. in (a.6) as

d1324 =

k1(z, x1) k3(z, x3)2z(cid:16) k2(z, x2) k4(z, x2)(cid:17)

(a.8)

putting relations (a.6,a.7, a.8) together, we nd in particular, for 1 = 3 = , 2 = 4 =
:

24d +1 +1 = 2x2

13d+1+1   +

  m(cid:17) d  

a special case is  = , which implies:

x2
24d+1+1 = x2

13d+1+1 .

iteration of (a.9) allows one to prove that more generally

(x2

24)n d+n+n = (x2

13)n d+n+n .

a.4 obtaining d1324 in closed form

by using a schwinger parameterization and performing the z integrals, one nds [30] (and ref-
erences therein):

d1324(x1, x3, x2, x4) =



where

we observe that any d1324 can be obtained by differentiating an appropriate number of
times in the variables xij the basic function

b(xij) = z qj dj(pi i  1)
kl(cid:17)2
(cid:16)pk,l klx2

.

(a.14)

b(xij) is given in closed form in [30]. from the integral representation (a.12) we immediately
nd

d1324 =

  d

d1+13+124

(a.15)

a.5 symmetrizing identities

equation (a.15) can be used to show that a sum of d functions which is symmetric under
x1  x3 and x2  x4 can always be rewritten in a basis in which each individual term shares
this symmetry, i.e. each term is of the form d  . for example:

x2
12d+1 +1  + x2

14d+1  +1 =

  d
2 

d   




x2
13d+1+1  

(a.16)

where   2+2 . let us see how to derive this identity. it follows from conformal invariance
that

d1324 = 
yi<j

(x2

i+j

 e1324(, )

(a.17)

are conformal cross ratios. from simple chain rule manipulations

where   x2

using (a.15), the last equation is tantamount to (a.16) for 1 = 3 = , 2 = 4 = .
similar arguments lead to the more complicated identity
