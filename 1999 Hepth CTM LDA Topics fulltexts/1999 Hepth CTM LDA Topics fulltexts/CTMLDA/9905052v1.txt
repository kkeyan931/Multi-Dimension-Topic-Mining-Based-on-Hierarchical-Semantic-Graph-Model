abstract

some n = 1 gauge theories, including sqed and nf = 1 sqcd, have
the property that, for arbitrary superpotentials, all stationary points of
the potential v = f + d are dat. for others, stationary points of
v are complex gauge transformations of dat congurations. as an
implication, the technique to parametrize the moduli space of super-
symmetric vacua in terms of a set of basic holomorphic g invariants can
be extended to non-supersymmetric vacua. a similar situation is found
in non-gauge theories with a compact global symmetry group.

i. introduction

one interesting feature of supersymmetric gauge theories is the existence of multi-
ple, physically inequivalent, v = 0 vacua [1]. this brings the notion of moduli space
msv of supersymmetric vacua (sv), the set of sv of a theory mod g transformations,
g the gauge group of the theory. classically, there is a well known construction of
msv [2,3]. let cn = {} be the vector space of constant matter eld congurations,
i(), i = 1, ..., s a basic set of holomorphic g invariants, d  cs the algebraic subset
of cs dened by the polynomial constraints among the basic invariants. there is
precisely one closed orbit of the complexication gc of the gauge group in each level
set i() = i
0, and there is a unique g orbit of dat points per closed gc orbit
(no dat point can be found in non-closed gc orbits). thus d is the moduli space
of dat points, and msv is the subset of d selected by the condition w = 0. for
some theories the above picture changes drastically in the quantum regime, where all
sv are lifted [1]. for others, the quantum moduli space of sv is the same as msv [4],
or a deformation of msv in its ambient vector space cs [1,5].
in the latter case,
knowledge of msv plays a crucial role in the determination of the quantum moduli
space of sv.

in this work we study non supersymmetric vacua (nsv) in the classical regime,
as a rst stage in the understanding of nsv in the quantum regime. a rst look at
the problem suggests that no much can be said about nsv, here dened to be v 6= 0
local minima of the scalar potential v . firstly, there are strong limitations on a
gauge or non-gauge supersymmetric theory to admit nsv. as an example, dimension-
ful constants are required in the superpotential w () to allow terms with dierent
powers of elds, otherwise w () would be a homogeneous function on the chiral
elds , w (x) = xdw (), and every stationary point v = 0 would be a sv, as
0 = v / = (d  1)f (+2d). secondly, for theories with nsv, there does not seem
to be any reasonable way to parametrize its moduli space mnsv. once the datness
condition is removed we may expect nsv in non-closed gc orbits. the basic holomor-
phic invariants do not separate gc orbits, they are only able to distinguish two
dierent gc orbits if they are closed. we could tackle this problem by using the
techniques developed in [6] to nd the extrema of functions which are invariant under
the action of a compact lie group g. the g orbits are the level sets of a complete
(holomorphic and non-holomorphic) basic set of g invariants j(, ), j = 1, ..., k.
the js are subject to polynomial (in)equalities that dene a semi-algebraic subset
o of r2s  cs [6]. the extrema of g invariant functions can be found by working
directly in the orbit space o [6]. however, computations are cumbersome because
a detailed knowledge of the g strata in o is required.
in this work we explore a
simpler alternative which is based on the simple structure of the scalar potential
v = f + d. note that f is the square norm of the gc covector (i.e., transforming
as  if  is in the  representation) w , whereas d is the square norm of the eld

2

a = tbk ba  lie (g), k ba the inverse killing metric in lie (g). 1 for a large
set of groups and representations this structure of v restricts all stationary points of
v (not only sv) to closed gc orbits. this fact not only simplies the search of nsv,
it also allows to construct the moduli space mv of all vacua, supersymmetric and
non-supersymmetric, as a subset of d, i.e., msv  mv  d.

in non gauge theories with a global symmetry group g the scalar potential equals
the square norm |w|2 of the gc covector w . for a large set of groups and rep-
resentations this implies that nsv are restricted to closed gc orbits, i.e., they are gc
related to (formal) dat points t  = 0 for all t  lie (g). thus, the datness
condition plays a role in the search of nsv of theories with a global symmetry g! such
n = 1 theories arise as the low energy eective actions of conning gauge theories,
and they often break supersymmetry. a well known example is the chiral theory with
one avor of matter in the four dimensional representation of su(2) [7].
the fact that nsv occur only in closed gc orbits guarantees the exact doubling
of goldstone bosons [8]. we have doubling when gc
, the little group of gc at the
c, the complexication of the little group of g at  (in
vacuum , is the same as g
, see [9]). an equivalent condition is that t  be unbroken whenever
general, g
t  lie (gc) is unbroken.2 this condition is satised if the orbit gc is closed, i.e., if
 is gc related to a dat point. to show this we can assume that  is dat, as
the gc isotropy groups of two points in a gc orbit are gc conjugated. if  is dat

) if t  lie (gc

). we should remark that the condition that gc

then t   lie (gc
be closed for nsv  is stronger than g
the organization of this paper is as follows: in section ii we introduce the notion of
bers, review the construction of msv, and state the hilbert-mumford criterion for
non-closed gc orbits; in section iii we study nsv of theories with a global symmetry.
section iv is devoted to gauge theories, and includes a subsection on abelian gauge
groups, for which a more systematic treatment is possible. the main results are
theorem i in section iii and theorems ii and iii in section iv.

ii. preliminaries

let g be a compact, connected group,  a unitary representation of g on cn.
we will consider simultaneously the cases where cn = {(1,   , n)} is the constant
chiral eld conguration space of a supersymmetric theory with global symmetry g,
or the constant matter chiral eld conguration space of an n = 1 gauge theory, g

1a transforms as an adjoint eld under g but this picture breaks after complexifying g.

being the gauge group. any g invariant holomorphic polynomial p() can be written
in terms of a basic set of invariants i(), i = 1,   , s as

p() = p( 1(), ..., s()),

(2)

where p is a polynomial cs  c function [10].
in general, the basic invariants
are constrained by polynomial equations c ( ) = 0, meaning that c ( ())  0.
the zero set d = {   cs : c ( ) = 0}  cs plays an important role in the
construction of the moduli space of supersymmetric vacua of the gauge theory with
matter content  and gauge group g. this construction is better understood if we
introduce the notion of bers. fibers are the level sets i() = i
0, i = 1,   , s of
the basic invariants, they are closed, disjoint sets. the conguration space cn = {}
is partitioned into bers, and the set of bers is parametrized by d. every ber
contains complete orbits of the complexication gc of g, possibly innitely many of
them, only one of which is closed (in the topological sense) [2]. the only closed gc
orbit in a ber f lies in the boundary of any other gc orbit in f , and can therefore
be found by taking the intersection of the closures of the gc orbits in f . let ta be a
basis of hermitian generators of g in the  representation. a g element admits the
expansion g = exp(ic ata) with real c as, whereas a gc element admits a similar
expansion with complex c as. it follows that the gc action on cn is non unitary.
consider a pure imaginary gc one dimensional subgroup g(s) = exp(st ), t a
hermitian lie (g) generator (note the absence of the i factor in the exponent) acting
on an arbitrary   cn, and dene (s)  g(s), then [3,11]

ds(cid:0)(s)(s)(cid:1) = 2(s)t (s),

equality holding only when t is a generator of the little group g of  (and so (s) =
constant). if t / lie (g), (s)(s) is a convex (positive second derivative) function
of s. convex r  r functions f (s) are easily seen to satisfy the following three prop-
erties: (i) there is at most one stationary point of f ; (ii) if s0 is a stationary point of
f , then it is a global minimum; (iii) if f   0 at some point, then lims f (s) = +.
from these properties, eqns.(3,4) and cartans decomposition gc = gt g, t a pure
imaginary maximal torus, follows that dat points 
dt d = 0 are vectors of min-
imum length in a gc orbit, and that there is at most one g orbit of such vectors in
a given gc orbit. it was found in [11] that closed gc orbits contain a unique g orbit
of dat points [11], that we will refer to as the core of the gc orbit, whereas no
dat point can be found in a non closed gc orbit. these facts allow a gauge inde-
pendent characterization of the datness condition found in wess-zumino gauge:
the supersymmetric vacua of a gauge theory with gauge group g lie on closed gc
orbits. they also allow to regard the set of bers d as the set of closed gc orbits,
or the moduli space of dat points, i.e., the set of dat congurations mod g
transformations. the relevance to supersymmetric gauge theories of the connection
between dat congurations, minimal length vectors and closed gc orbits found
in [11] was rst pointed out in [2]. the supersymmetric vacua (sv) of an n = 1 gauge

4

theory satisfy two conditions: (f) the fatness condition w = 0 and (d) the
datness condition t  = 0t  lie (g). condition (f) is gc invariant, every
point in the orbit gcf of an fat point f is fat, and, by continuity, every
point in the closure gc is fat. condition (d) imposes an additional restriction:
the sv lie on the core of closed gc orbits. however, once an fat point f is found,
we know there is a g orbit of sv in gcf , namely, the core of dat points in the
only closed gc orbit in gcf . in other words, (f) selects the bers f where the sv
live, (d) their location in f . as there is one closed gc orbit per ber, which contains
precisely one g orbit of dat points, the moduli space of sv msv (sv mod g trans-
formations), is the same as the set of bers containing w = 0 gc orbits. msv  d
can be parametrized by adding to the constraint equations c ( ) = 0 dening d the
g invariant holomorphic equations resulting from w = 0 [3]. in the special case
w = 0, msv = d, the moduli space of dat points.
in non-gauge theories with a global symmetry g, the sv satisfy only the gc invariant
fatness condition. generically, there are innitely many g orbits per gc orbit,
and so there is no clear way to parametrize the moduli space of sv in non-gauge the-
ories.
in the following sections we show that, for a large set of gauge theories, the v 6= 0
stationary points of the scalar potential v = f +d, f = |w|2, d = g2
lie all on closed gc orbits (not necessarily in their cores), there being at most one
g orbit of stationary points of v in a closed gc orbit. this leads to a parametriza-
tion of the moduli space mnsv of nsv as a subset of d, the set of closed gc orbits.
mnsv is obtained by projecting onto d the stationary point condition v = 0 and
the condition that the boson mass matrix ijv at the stationary point be positive
semidenite. this may result in non-holomorphic (in)equalities. the moduli space
of vacua is then mv = msv  mnsv  d  cs. a similar situation is found in some
non-gauge theories with a global symmetry g, their nsv are restricted to closed orbits
of the complexication gc of the global symmetry group g, i.e., they are gc related
to formal dat points. we make use of a theorem due to mumford that says that,
given a non-closed orbit gc0, the closed gc orbit lying in the boundary of gc0 can
be reached by means of a one dimensional pure imaginary subgroup of gc:
theorem [mumford] [9,10]: assume gc0 is not closed, then there is a hermitian
generator t of g such that lims exp(st )0 = c, and gcc is closed.
remark:
(t )  0  (and strictly positive for some ). this implies |c| < ||, and also
lims | exp(st )| = .
example ii.1: consider g = u(1) acting on c2,  = (u, v), u a charge 1 eld and
v a charge 1 eld. lie (g) = span(t ), t = diag(1,1). gc = gl(1, c) acting by
x  (u, v) = (xu, x1v). the set of basic invariants contains a single eld z = uv, then
d = c1. the bers uv = z0 6= 0 contain a single (therefore closed) gc orbit, with
a core of vectors of minimum length (dat points) satisfying uv = z0, |u| = |v|.
the ber z = 0 contains the closed orbit o1 = {(0, 0)} and the non-closed orbits
o2 = {(u, 0), u 6= 0},o3 = {(0, v), v 6= 0}, which do not contain vectors of minimum
length. also o1  o1  o2  o3. for points in o2 (o3), est (es(t )) is as in

if the u(1) symmetry is local, and we add a superpotential
mumfords theorem.
w (z) to this gauge theory, the sv condition 0 = w = w (z)(v, u) yields a single
holomorphic g invariant equation, namely zw (z) = 0. this equations selects the
bers containing w = 0 gc orbits. as there is a unique g orbit of dat points per
ber, the moduli space of sv of this gauge theory is msv = {z  c|zw (z) = 0}. if
the u(1) symmetry were global, every point in bers z0 satisfying w (z0) = 0 would
be a sv. as every ber contains innitely many g orbits, there is no clear way to
parametrize mnsv.
example ii.2: consider a theory with a matrix m of chiral elds and a superpotential
invariant under m  gmg1, g  su(n). the conguration space is cn 2
, g =
  1
su(n),  = adj + 1, and gc = sl(n, c). the adjoint eld is a
n 
 tr m,
and the singlet is u = tr m. the holomorphic invariants are 1 = u and i =
tr ai, i = 2,   , n, they are unconstrained and so d = cn . jordans decomposition
implies that in every gc orbit there is an element of the form (u, a), a = s +n, where
s is diagonal, n strictly upper triangular, and [s, n] = 0, these are the semisimple
and nilpotent parts of a. note that i = tr si, i > 1 then (u, s + n) and (u, s + n )
belong to the same ber. in [10], section 8.5, it is established that the gc orbit of
s+n is closed i n = 0. as there is one closed gc orbit per ber we conclude that if s
and s are semisimple and tr si = tr si, i = 2, ..., n then s = gsg1, g  sl(n, c).
as there is a nite number of gc orbits of nilpotent as ( [10], section 8.5) every ber
(u, tr ai) = (u0, i
0) contains the same (nite) number of gc orbits, a picture that
diers substantially from that of example ii.1. mumfords curve switches o the
nilpotent piece of the adjoint eld. take, e.g., n = 3, 0 = (a0, u), a0 = s + n,

were global, msv constructed above would not be a parametrization of the moduli
space of sv, as there are innitely many g orbits in each w = 0 gc orbit of type (i).

iii. non-supersymmetric vacua in theories with a global

symmetry

if w is a g invariant superpotential its gradient w transforms as a gc covector

w (g) = w (), w (g) = w ()g1.

(7)

it is useful to think of w () as a map cn  cn commuting with the g actions 
and . the vector  is assigned the covector w (), f = |w|2 measures its square
it follows from (7) that under this map the orbit gc = {g|g  gc} 
length.
cn gets mapped onto the orbit gcw ()  cn; also g  gw (), gw () being
the little group of the cn point w (), g the little group of  [9]. we exploit
the fact that eqs. (3, 4) and all the results of the previous section apply to any g
representation, in particular , where w lives. thus, if f (0) is a local minimum
of f , w (0) is a covector of minimum length in its gc orbit, then gcw () must
be closed, and w (0) satises the datness condition

(w (0))(t )(w (0)) = 0, t  lie (g) .

(8)

we prove now that, under certain assumptions, this implies that gc0 itself is closed.
to see this, dene for any 0 and hermitian t the curve (s)  est 0 and also
f (s)  [w ((s))][w ((s))] = |(w (0)) exp(st )|2. applying (3,4) to the  rep-
resentation (or just computing the second derivative of f (s)) we see that, whenever

t / lie(cid:0)gw (0)(cid:1), f (s) is a convex r  r function. if f (0) = 0, then 0 = f (0) =

w (0)(t )(w (0)), f (0) is a global minimum of f (s), and lims f = .
as a consequence gc0 must be closed.
if it were not, we could choose t as in
mumfords theorem and get to a contradiction: f (c) = lims f (s) = , where
c = lims (s) 3 we conclude that gc0 being non-closed forbids 0 from being
a stationary point of f . the only exception is when, for any t as in mumfords
if this is the case then f is non-conning, that is
lims | exp(st )0| =  while lims f (exp(st )0) = f (0) < . for 0 and t
that (t )  0 , then f (c) < f (0) except in the non-conning case (t ) = 0 ,
where f (c) = f (0).4 these observations are gathered in the following theorem:

theorem, t  lie(cid:0)gw (0)(cid:1).
as in mumfords theorem the weight decomposition w (0) =p(w (0)) is such

theorem i: assume gc0 is non-closed and c is as in mumfords theorem.
(a) f (c)  f (0), a lower energy point can be found in the closed gc orbit in the

3even if w has singularities, it is not possible that f be well dened at 0 and singular at
c. this is so because one can always write w () = w ( ()), then w = (w/ j) j .
now w/ j is constant on gc0 and the  j are polynomials, so no singularity can develop
along the bounded (s), s  0 curve.
4if this is the case, and we are only interested in the spectrum of vacuum energies, we can
use the fact that f (0) = f (c) and still restrict the search of vacua to closed gc orbits.

imaginary one dimensional subgroup exp(st ) of gc is a convex function of s, i.e.,
d2d(exp(st )0)/ds2 > 0s  r. for 0 and t as in mumfords theorem, this
implies that 0 cannot be a stationary point of the scalar potential v = f +d, as v

points of v in ccn are restricted to closed gc orbits. if also d2d(exp(st )c)/ds2 > 0
for any c  ccn in closed gc orbits and any t  (lie (g)\ lie (g)), we can show, as

in sections ii and iii, that there is at most one g orbit of stationary points of v per
closed gc orbit. the stationary point condition v (0) = 0 reads

ta(t ta + tat ) = 0.

we gather the above observations in the following theorem: (in the aim of seeking
simplicity we made some assumptions stronger than necessary).

theorem ii: restrict to the sector ccn = {  cn | d2d(exp(st ))/ds2 >

0 whenever t / lie (g)} of the conguration space cn, then:
(a) for any superpotential, every stationary point s of v = f + d lies in a closed
gc orbit, (equivalently, it is gc related to a dat conguration), satises the mod-
ied datness (mdatness) condition eq. (10), and is a global minimum of the
restriction of v to gcs. in particular, there is no local maximum of v .
(b) the moduli space of vacua mv is the subset of d  cs obtained by adding to
the constraint equations among basic invariants the non-holomorphic (in)equalities
resulting from the stationary point condition v / = 0 and the condition that the
boson mass matrix ijv at the stationary point be positive semidenite.

the proof of (b) follows again from the fact that there is at most one g orbit of
stationary points in a closed gc orbit and that d is the set of closed gc orbits. for
supersymmetric vacua the projection of v = 0 onto d reduces to the g holomorphic
invariant equations obtained from w = 0, and 2v  0 does not add any restric-
tions. mv is the union of the moduli spaces of sv and nsv, mv = msv  mnsv  d.
example iv.1: following the notation of examples ii.1 and iii.1, the d term of sqed
is d = (uuvv)2 = ||44|z|2,  = (u, v). as z is gc invariant, |z|2 is a constant along
any (s) = exp(st ) curve, whereas |(s)|4 is clearly a convex function (whenever
t / lie(cid:0)u(1)(u,v)(cid:1)), and so is d(s). alternatively, we can apply eqs (3, 4) to the
1-dimensional charge 2,2 and 0 u(1) representations u2, v2 and uv to show that
d = |u2|2 + |v2|2  2|uv|2 is the sum of two convex functions and a constant.
in
this example the conguration spacecc2 equals c2, and theorem 2 holds everywhere.
given an arbitrary w (z), v = |w |2(|u|2 + |v|2) + g2
8 (|u|2  |v|2)2. the stationary
point condition v = 0 is always satised at the origin  = 0 and at no other point
in the uv = 0 ber. for nonzero uv it is equivalent to 0 = uv /u  vv /v:

eq.(11) forces d = 0, showing that stationary points lie on closed gc orbits, as pre-
dicted. projecting (12) onto d we obtain the equations characterizing the bers con-
taining critical points, namely 0 = zw (z)(w (z) + 2zw (z)). to project ijv  0
at stationary points onto d we use the section d  z  (u = z, v = z)  c2.
when replacing u = v = z and w (z) + 2zw (z) = 0 in the equations requiring
that the eigenvalues of ijv be  0, the inequalities reduce to w  + zw  = 0.
thus mv = {z  c1|zw (z) = 0}  {z  c1|w (z) + 2zw (z) = w  + zw  =
0} = msv  mnsv. the equations dening mnsv are independent of g, this is also
the moduli space of nsv of the non-gauge theory of example iii.1.

as a rst step towards generalizing the ideas behind the previous example we

re-write the d term using the g representation  s . let  = pr r be the

decomposition of  into irreps, then

d =xr,s

using t rs

a = t r

(15)

j(r  s) being the projector of r  s onto the irrep j and ck the casimir of the
irrep k. the above equation reduces the d term to a sum of square norms of irreps of
the gauge group, eqs (3,4) hold for each one of the square norms |j(r  s)|2. if  is
free of gravitational anomalies then 0 = tr (t r
this implies that some of the coecients (cj  cr  cs) in (15) are negative.
in
example iv.1 the only such term corresponds to a gc singlet and d is readily seen to
be convex along any exp(st ) curve.
example iv.2: consider g = so(n) with a single vector eld,  s  contains a
symmetric tensor (for which c  2c is positive), and a gc singlet. in this example
again, the only negative coecient in eq. (15) accompanies a gc singlet, for any 
and t d(exp(st ))) is convex, nsv occur only in closed gc orbits, and theorem ii

a) =pjrs dim(j)(cj  cr  cs).

example iv.3: in nf avor, n color sqcd (15) contains symmetric and adjoint ten-
sors, for which c > 2cf und, some gc singlets and antisymmetric tensors, for which
c < 2cf und. in the special case nf = 1 there is no antisymmetric tensor, d(s) is
convex and theorem ii holds. for larger nf a more detailed analysis is required.
i , qj
consider, e.g, the case nf = 2, n = 3 and the conguration point 0 = (q
)
 = 0. as 0 6= 0 and (0) = 0, gc is
given by q
non-closed. eq. (15) yields d  (n  1)(|q1|4 +|q2|4 +|q1|2|q2|2 +|q
1q2|2) (n +

1q2|2). the su(3) generator t = diag(1, 1,2) is as in mumfords
theorem, and d(est 0) = d(0)e2s is convex, the exponentially decaying terms
with negative coecients in (15) get cancelled by positive coecient terms with the
same decaying rate. for other choices, like t  = diag(1, 2,3), the negative coecient
exponential terms persist but still d(s) is convex. note that among the normalized
lie (g) generators diag(1, 1,2)/6 is the one that steers 0 to zero fastest.
should be supplemented with information on the weight decomposition  =p .

as this example suggests, to determine the convexity of d(exp(st )), eq.(15)

11

as g is compact, the (t )s are rationally related, i.e., (t ) = nq, n a nonnegative
integer, q a unit charge. the problem of determining if d(s) is convex reduces to
a problem of existence of roots of the polynomial p(x)  d(s), x = exp(sq), in
the range 0  x  1. the convexity of d along mumford type curves would exclude
points in non-closed gc orbits from the set of nsv. in this case (gc non-closed and
exp(st ) as in mumfords theorem) we know that the weight vectors  are all in the
half space (t )  0, as lims exp(st ) exists. for g semisimple, no generic result
has been obtained so far regarding the convexity of d(s). the analysis is simplied
in the abelian case g = u(1)k, for which we have a fairly straightforward way to
determine wether d(s) is convex or not.

a. u (1)k gauge groups

from eq. (15), or more directly inserting  =p  in d() =pa(ta)2, ta

an orthonormal basis of lie (g), we obtain a simple expression for d in the abelian
case:

from where

||2||2(ta)(ta) =x

< ,  > ||2||2e2s((t )+(t )).

d =xa
d(exp(st )) =x
s =(x6=0

c  | 0  c  1)

(16)

(18)

(19)

in the abelian case, we also have a simple criterion to determine whether gc is closed
or not: construct the convex set

it can be shown that:
(a) 0 is outside s i gc is a non-closed orbit and () = 0,
(b) 0 is a boundary point of s i gc is a non-closed orbit and () 6= 0,
(c) 0 is an inner point of s i gc is closed.
the proof follows trivially from propositions 5.3 and 6.15 in [10].

example iv.4: in a ndimensional u(1) representation, the weights  of a point 0
in a non-closed orbit lie all to the right of 0, all coecients in (17) are non-negative,
d(s) > 0 and, for any superpotential, the stationary points of v lie all on closed
orbits. this generalizes example iv.1.

example iv.5: consider the u(1)u(1) 4-dimensional representation with orthonor-
mal generators

the weight diagram is a square centered on 0 (gure 1). the weights are orthogonal,
the matrix < ,  > in eqs. (16, 17) is diagonal, d(exp(st )) is convex for any 
and t , and theorem ii holds in the entire conguration space. vectors can be clas-
sied according to the number of nonzero weights. there are two classes of vectors
in closed orbits: (i) 4 weight vectors and (ii) two opposite weight vectors. there are
three dierent types of vectors in non-closed orbits: (iii) three weight vectors, which
satisfy () 6= 0, and (iv) two adjacent weight vectors and (v) one weight vectors,
for which () = 0, i.e., they are in the same ber as  = 0. take, e.g, case (iii),
mumfords curve (s) shuts down one weight leaving a case (ii) vector. the basic
invariants are 1 = 13 and 2 = 24, they are unconstrained, then d = c2. for
any w , mv = msv  mnsv will be a subset of d = c2.

the weight diagram is a hexagon centered on 0 (gure 2). by excluding two ad-
jacent weights we get a 4-weight vector in a non-closed orbit. take e.g 0 =
(1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0), i 6= 0, i = 1, ..., 4, the boundary of s appears in dotted lines
in gure 2. it can readily be checked that: (1) there is a unique choice of t satisfying
mumfords theorem, (2) est 0 turns o 2 and 3 and (3) d2d/ds2 may (i) change
sign, (ii) be positive, (iii) be negative, and that d(s) may even grow along this curve
depending on the values of the is. theorem ii does not apply, we cannot draw any
conclusions for this theory.

b. energy bounds in core-to-core theories

there are many examples of theories for which w () sends the core of dat
points in closed gc orbits in cn onto the core of *dat points of closed orbits in
cn. for these theories, given any point 0 in a non-closed gc orbit, the dat
points in the closed orbit in the boundary of gc0 have lower energy.

theorem iii: assume w () sends dat points onto *dat points,
[w ()]t [w ()] = 0 t  lie (g) if t  = 0 t  lie (g).
closed and d is a dat point in the boundary of gc0, then v (d) < v (0).
proof: let c be as in mumfords theorem, d a dat point in the closed orbit
gcc. as w (d) is *dat , d is a global minimum of the restriction of f to gcc,
then f (d)  f (c). as f decreases along mumfords curve f (c)  f (0). thus
f (d)  f (c)  f (0), and also 0 = d(d) < d(0), from where v (d) < v (0).

example iv.7: theories having a single basic invariant satisfy the hypothesis of
theorem iii (see example iii.4). table i lists all asymptotically free, anomaly free
representations of simple groups having a single basic invariant, they were obtained
from [12]. for all these theories v (d), gd the core of dat points in the boundary
of the non-closed orbit gc0, gives a lower bound to the energies {v ()|  gc0}
among these representations, the real ones have the property that, for any invariant
w , w ()(t )(w ())  t  (example iii.4), this implies that dat points
satisfy the mdat condition eq.(10). for a subset of the real s in table i the
tensor decomposition  s  contains only two irreps, one of which is a singlet, for
them, theorem ii holds in the entire conguration space, and, as happens for sqcd,
the stationary points of v are dat, a non generic feature among the theories
satisfying the hypothesis of theorem ii.

there are many other examples of theories for which w () sends dat points

onto *dat points. theorem iii applies for all these theories.
example iv.8 : for nf < n (nf = n) the basic sqcd holomorphic invariants are
 (and b = det q, b = det q). a straightforward calculation shows that
m j
the gradient of any avor invariant superpotential w (detm) sends dat points

v. conclusions

we proved in theorems i and ii that for a large set of theories with a compact
global symmetry g and gauge theories with gauge group g, every non-supersymmetric
vacuum is dat or gc related to a dat point. this not only simplies the search
of nsv but also leads to a parametrization of its moduli space mnsv in terms of basic
holomorphic invariants, extending the well known technique of constructing msv. we
also showed in theorem i that in generic theories with a compact global symmetry
g, if gc0 is non-closed, a lower energy point exists in the closed gc orbit in the
boundary of gc0. this is also the case for a number of gauge theories, for which
a dat point in the boundary of a non-closed orbit gc0 always has lower energy
than 0 (theorem iii). to our knowledge, these are the rst known results on moduli
spaces of non-supersymmetric vacua. they uncover an unexpected connection be-
tween non-supersymmetric vacua and the datness condition.
