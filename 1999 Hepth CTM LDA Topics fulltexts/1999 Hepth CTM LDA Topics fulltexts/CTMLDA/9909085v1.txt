in this note a lately proposed gravity dual of noncommutative yang-mills theory is

derived from the relations, recently suggested by seiberg and witten, between closed string

moduli and open string moduli. the only new input one needs is a simple form of the

running string tension as a function of energy. this derivation provides convincing evidence

that string theory integrates with the holographical principle, and demonstrates a direct

link between noncommutative yang-mills theory and holography.

september 14, 1999

by now it becomes clear that any consistent theory that unies quantum mechanics

and general relativity requires dramatically new ideas beyond what we have been familiar

with. two such ideas, the holographic principle [1] and noncommutative geometry [2],

have recently attracted increasing attention in string theory community. the holographic

principle [1], originally motivated by the area dependence of black hole entropy, asserts

that all information on a quantum theory of gravity in a volume is encoded in the boundary

surface of the volume. though this principle seems to conict with our intuition from local

quantum eld theory, string theory as a promising candidate of quantum gravity is believed

[3] to integrate with it. indeed the maldacena conjecture [4], motivated by the d-brane

models of black hole in string theory, is nothing but an embodiment [5] of the holographic

principle: there is an equivalence or correspondence between supergravity (or closed string

theory) on an anti-de sitter space, say of ve dimensions, and a supersymmetric yang-mills

gauge theory on its four-dimensional boundary.

in a parallel development, yang-mills theory on a space with noncommutative coordi-

nates [6], which we will call noncommutative yang-mills theory (ncym), has been found

to arise naturally in string theory, rst in the multi-d-brane description [7], then in matrix

theory [8,9] or string theory [10] compactications with nonvanishing antisymmetric tensor

background, and most recently in a special limit that decouples closed string contributions

from the open string description for coincident d-branes with a constant rank-2 antisym-

metric tensor b-background (see [12] and references therein). right now it is the last case

that is the focus of attention. a rather thorough discussion of the aspects of ncym from

the open string versus closed string perspectives has been given in the work of seiberg and

witten [12] which, among other things, also claries several puzzles previously encountered

in ncym, including the one raised by one of us [11]. moreover, the supposed-to-be gravity

duals of ncyms in the decoupling limit, which generalize the usual maldacena conjecture

without b-background, were also constructed [13,14].

one might think that ncym is relevant only in non-generic situations, such as the

above-mentioned decoupling limit in which the b-background is brought to innity, so it

cannot shed much light on deep issues as holography and quantum nature of spacetime.

in this letter we show that this is not true. with an observation made on a direct link

between the ncym and its gravity dual, we will try to argue for the opposite: switching

on a b-background allows one to probe the nature of holography with ncym, and will

probably lead to uncovering more, previously unsuspected links between a large-n theory

and its closed string dual.

1

one of the central observations in [12] is that the natural moduli to use in open string

theory with ends on a set of coincident d-branes in the presence of a constant b-eld are

dierent from those dened for closed strings. the eective action for the system is more
elegantly written if one uses the open string metric gij and an antisymmetric tensor ij,
and their relation to the closed string metric gij and the antisymmetric tensor eld bij is

gij = gij  ()2(bg1b)ij
ij = 2(cid:18)

g + b(cid:19)ij

1

,

a

(1)

where the subscript a indicates the antisymmetric part. our normalization of the b eld

diers from that in [12] by a factor 2. seiberg and witten noted that in the limit   0
and gij  0 (assuming bij is nondegenerate), it is possible to keep gij and ij xed
with a xed bij. the tree level eective action surviving this limit is the noncommutative
yang-mills action, with a star product of functions dened using ij:

f  g(x) = ei/2ij  x

i  y

j f (x)g(y) |y=x .

(2)

this is equivalent to the noncommutativity: xi  xj  xj  xi = iij [15].

the open string coupling constant gs, proportional to the yang-mills coupling g2

y m ,
is also dierent from the closed string coupling constant. the relation between the two is

gs = gs(cid:18)

det g

det(g + b)(cid:19)1/2

.

(3)

it is easy to see that in the double scaling limit when   0, g  0, keeping xed the

open string coupling gs (say for d3-branes), gs must be taken to zero too. thus closed
strings decouple from the open string sector described by the ncym. we will see that this

perfectly matches with the closed string dual description of the ncym.

using the conventions of [14], the ns elds in the gravity dual proposed for d3-branes

with a constant b23 are [13,14]

ds2

str = r2u2(cid:20)(dt2 + dx2

1) +

1

1 + a4u4 (dx2

2 + dx2

3)(cid:21) + r2 du2

u2 + r2d2
5,

b23 = b

e2 = g2

a4u4

1 + a4u4 ,
1 + a4u4 ,

1

(4)

2

where we have set  = 1. the constant b is the value of b23 at the boundary u = ,
and the constant g is the closed string coupling in the infrared u = 0. here r4 = 4gn ,

and the parameter a is given by

ba2 = r2.

(5)

in addition to the usual c(4) induced by the presence of d3-branes, there is also an

induced c(2) eld.

its presence is quite natural for d3-branes. recall that a constant

b23 on the branes can be replaced by a constant magnetic eld. performing s-duality

transformation, this eld becomes the electric eld e = f01. this electric eld is dened
using the dual quanta, thus it is equivalent to a c01. the u-dependent c01 is given in [14]:

c01 =

a2r2

g

u4.

(6)

it is natural to interpret the elds appearing in the gravity dual (4) as closed string
moduli. note that apart from the u2 factor, there is an additional factor 1/(1 + a4u4) in

the closed string metric on the plane (x2, x3). thus if one is to hold the geometry on the

plane (t, x1) xed, then the geometry on the plane (x2, x3) shrinks when the boundary is
approached. by the uv/ir relation [16], this means that the closed string metric shrinks to

zero in the uv limit from the open string perspective. here comes our central observation.

we identify the uv limit as the double scaling limit of [12], thus gij shrinks in the uv

limit is quite natural. in this limit,  must also approach zero. this is just right in the
ads/cft correspondence [4]. note that there is an overall factor r2u2 in (4) for the 4d

geometry along d3-branes. this redshift factor can be interpreted as the eective string

tension



ef f =

1

r2u2 .

(7)

therefore 

ef f also approaches zero in the uv limit. the manner in which it approaches
zero compared to gij agrees with the limit taken in [12]. note that here we dier from the
philosophy of [14] in which  itself is taken to zero, while we have set it to be 1.

now we are ready to derive the ns elds in the closed string dual (4) by applying

formulas (1) and (3). the way in which seiberg and witten derived these formulas is

valid if we treat strings as eective strings at a xed energy scale when loop eects are

included. thus we can taken these formulas as giving relations among the open string

moduli and the closed string moduli at a xed cut-o e = ru. bigatti and susskind

argued [17] that in the large n limit, the eective action of ncym can be obtained by

3

replacing the usual product in the eective action of n = 4 sym by the star product.

this in particular implies that there is no renormalization for the open string metric, the
yang-mills coupling constant gs and the noncommutative moduli ij. now  is replaced
by 
ef f at a xed energy scale, so the closed string moduli are renormalized. due to the

rotational symmetry on the (x2, x3) plane, we introduce ansatz

gij = f (u)ij, bij = h(u)ij.

the rst equation in (1) yields

or

ij = ij (cid:0)f + h2f 1/(r4u4)(cid:1) ,

f 2 +

h2
r4u4 = f.

the second equation in (1) leads to

2

1

r2u2 (cid:18)f 2 +

h2

r4u4(cid:19)1

h
r2u2 ij = 2

a2
r2 ij,

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

where we used the fact that ij is not renormalized and is given by (2/b)ij, and b =
r2/a2. this second equation is just

h = a2r2u4(cid:18)f 2 +

h2

r4u4(cid:19) .

(12)

combined with eq.(10) we have h = a2r2u4f , and substitute this into eq.(10) we nd

f (u) =

1

1 + a4u4 .

(13)

this is precisely what appeared in (4) which is obtained as a solution to classical equation
of motion in closed string theory. with h = a2r2u4f we nd

h(u) =

a2r2u4
1 + a4u4 = b

a4u4

1 + a4u4 ,

(14)

also agrees with (4).

substitute the above solution into (3) with the identication gs = g, the energy

dependent closed string coupling is also solved

gs = g(cid:0)det(g + 

ef f b)(cid:1)1/2

4

= g(1 + a4u4)1/2.

(15)

again, this agrees with (4). the closed string coupling becomes weaker and weaker in the

uv limit. although this uv asymptotic freedom appears in the closed string dual, it does

not mean that there is asymptotic freedom in ncym, as we have seen that the yang-mills

coupling is not renormalized in the large n limit.

having shown that the rather ad hoc looking closed string background is naturally a

solution to (1) and (3), one still has room to doubt whether this is a coincidence. to check

that our procedure is indeed a correct one, we turn to the case when both b01 are b23 are

turned on. the solution is also found in [13,14]. we use the euclidean signature for all

coordinates. in such a case, both the geometry of (t, x1) and the one of (x2, x3) shrink at

the boundary in the similar manner. let a as dened before, and a related to b01 in the

same way as a is related to b23. we need not to repeat the above steps in deriving the

metric and the b eld, since these elds are block digaonalized and so we will have the

similar results. the closed string coupling is given by, in this case

gs = g(cid:0)det(g + 

ef f b)(cid:1)1/2

= g(1 + a4u4)1/2(1 + a4u4)1/2,

(16)

where the determinant is taken of the matrix including all component. this result agrees

with the classical solution in [13,14]. other part of the closed string metric can not be re-

produced so simply. due the result of bigatti and susskind, and the unbroken r-symmetry

so(6), it must be identical to that in the ads case without b eld background.

we see that the relations among the closed string moduli and the open string moduli

contain much more than we could have imagined. with the input 

ef f , they determine
the closed string dual of ncym! we venture to conjecture that this is a quite general

fact.

it can be applied for instance to other dp-brane case with constant b eld, and

perhaps other backgrounds. also, we expect that 1/n corrections will at least renormalize

the yang-mills coupling. the relation (3) likely holds in this case, thus the closed string

coupling must be renormalized by the 1/n eects.

we now apply our procedure to dp-branes with constant b eld. switching on b23

only, the solution in this case is given in [14]. this solution is similar to (4). for the
shrinking metric, we replace 1/(1 + a4u4) by 1/(1 + (au)7p), where a is determined by
b2a7p = r7p. the overall factor (ru)2 in (4) is replaced by (ru)(7p)/2. the u-

dependent b eld is

b23 = b

(au)7p

1 + (au)7p ,

5

(17)

and the dilaton eld is

e2 = g2u(7p)(p3)/2

1

1 + (au)7p .

(18)

to obtain this solution from (1), we need to use 

ef f = (ru)(p7)/2. introduce the

same ansatz for gij and bij as before, the two equations in (1) combine to yield

h = (ar)(7p)/2u7pf.

substitute this into either equation in (1) we obtain

f =

1

1 + (au)7p .

this together with (19) results in the correct answer for the b eld.

relation (3) determines

g2
s = g2

sf.

(19)

(20)

(21)

to agree with (18) we must have g2

s = g2u(7p)(p3)/2. this just means that the open
string coupling runs in the same way as in the case when there is no b eld. this fact

certainly agrees with the result of [17] in the large n limit.

our derivation of the closed string dual from ncym is based on the idea that at the

dynamical level, namely when the quantum eects in ncym are included by renormaliza-

tion down to xed energy scale e = u, the relations among the open string moduli and

closed string moduli in view of eective strings should be the one derived at the tree level,

as done in [12]. although this idea may nd its root in some previous known facts, such

as fischler-susskind mechanism, and polyakovs introduction of liouville eld to mimic

quantum eects in qcd, we have not found a similar precise statement in the literature.

need to explain the eective string tension, namely 

to complete our derivation of the closed string dual in the d3-brane case, we still
ef f = 1/(r2u2). as we explained,
this relation is natural in the supergravity side of the original ads/cft correspondence.

we are yet to understand it directly in the gauge theory. if we measure energy with time t

in the gauge theory with metric component g00 = 1, we identify e = u. in sym without
ef f  1/e2 = 1/u2. yet we
noncommutative parameters, this is the only scale, thus 
have to attribute the coecient 1/r2 to quantum eects. back to ncym, there are two

scales, one of which is determined by , another energy scale. according to the result of
ef f = 1/(ru)2 in

[17], the large n string tension is the same as in ordinary sym, thus 

ncym too.

6

we have left out the derivation of the metric du2/u2 in the induced dimension. this
together with other parts of the metric induces an anomaly term in the special conformal

transformation. this term is computed in sym in [18] at the one loop level, providing

a satisfactory interpretation of the full ads metric. although ncym is not conformally

invariant, we expect that a similar calculation to that in [18] can be done and thus justies
du2/u2.

the fact that the geometry on (x2, x3) shrinks toward the boundary when b23 6= 0 has
been source of confusions. our scheme claries this issue. the geometry in the supergravity

dual is not to be confused with the geometry in ncym. the latter remains xed at all

energy scales, while the geometry felt by closed strings becomes degenerate in the uv

limit, as it ought to be according to [12].

there remain quite a few puzzles to be understood within our scheme. we need to

understand why and how the gkpw prescription [5] works, and why the calculation of

the force between a pair of heavy quark and anti-quark requires a dierent prescription

[14]. among other things, it can be shown that there does not exist a nontrivial geodesic

connecting two points on the boundary and separated in x2. this already indicates in-
teresting behavior of correlation functions at the two point function level. we leave these

issues for future study.

in conclusion, we have observed that the moduli in the gravity duals of ncym should

be understood as closed string moduli, and they can be reproduced from the seiberg-

witten relations (1) between open and closed string moduli, once the string tension in

these relations is understood as a running one with simple energy dependence as given in

(7). this observation not only helps clarify a few puzzles in understanding the gravity

dual of ncym but also, more importantly, demonstrates a simple and direct connection

between ncym and the holographic principle, either of which is believed to play a role in

the ultimate theoretical structure for quantum gravity. in particualr, the existence of such

a link between ncym and holography seems to indicate the fundamental signicance of

noncommutativity in space or spacetime. (for another perspective pointing to the same

direction, see [19].) to search for appropriate geometric framework for the nonperturbative

formulation of string/m theory, further exploring the connections between these two themes

should be helpful. for instance, it would be interesting to consider further deformation

of ncym, to see what it will lead to as the holographic image on boundary for a closed

string dual in bulk.
