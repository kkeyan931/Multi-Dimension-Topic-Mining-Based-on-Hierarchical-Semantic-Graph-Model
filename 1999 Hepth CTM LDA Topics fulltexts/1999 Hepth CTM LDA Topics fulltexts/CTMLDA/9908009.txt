automatically gives d(p 2) formal dierence bundles dp p pair, belonging grothendieck group coherent sheaves ambient. 0 0 0 2 v n 0 1 2 v 9 0 0 8 0 9 9 / h - p e h : v x r 1 introduction. recently major shift perspective interpretation tachyons brane-antibrane pairs {$9808141$}. long since suspected signal instabilities, one could forecast whether led inconsistency theory could instead constructive role. believed latter case, tachyons viewed simply higgs elds, whose condensation lead interesting eects. particular, lead remnants whose stability turn simply dictated topological stability condensation. interested type ii theories stable products decay. brane antibrane gauge bundles e f respectively, need something classies topological content pair. key note {$9810188$}, two bundles topologically same, annihilate leaving stable remnant: case stable pattern condensation tachyon. moreover, trivial pair added non trivial ones, disappear, giving contribution. write symbolically (e, f ) (e h, f h). since denition topological k-theory, interpret physics identifying brane-antibrane system element group (hints direction explicitly given {$9710230$}). identify physically result decay, general vacuum (as exist non-trivial elements k-theory). locus tachyon vanishes place around energy located, source lower rr elds. natural identify brane supported zero locus; viewed section e f . second point makes possible k-theory also classies lower-dimensional d-branes. let us stress classication pairs k-theory identi- cation remnant are, far, two dierent steps. note, indeed, k-theory class dene bundle : change representative, latter changes well. argue that, deal complex analytic subvarieties, identication remnant natural consequence rst step, way puts new light incorporation lower charges. be- cause case choose, instead k-theory, analytic (algebraic- geometric) version it, grothendieck group coherent sheaves , hereafter referred simply grothendieck group (as commonly meant algebraic geometry; general name simply denotes procedure get group monoid). setting, bundles subvarieties expressible - projective resolutions - formal dierences bundles ambient variety. allows us see identication brane-antibrane k-theory footing brane- antibrane lower-dimensional brane; way, becomes automatic, 1 natural. one hand, seems conrm physical analysis already done; other, allows us interpret descent relations, tachyon condensation stable d-branes, terms projective resolutions. turn, physical identication dp p d(p 2) viewed purely topological counterpart algebraic-geometric procedure. one stress dierence said already known mathematical counterpart tachyon condensation: iso- morphism k-theory submanifold ambient. isomorphism dierent groups, propose descent relation viewed natural one single group. even better, isomorphism natural, justify identication d(p 2) pair. case, contrary, treat complex analytic subvarieties choose use grothendieck groups: that, identication product tachyon condensation logical consequence existence projec- tive resolutions coherent sheaves. related issue following. one often says k-theory ambient space classies branes: so, representatives group lower-dimensional branes, also dierent classes branes dierent dimensions. rst feature demonstrated there, second would lack choose dierent boundary conditions (and thus compactications ambient space, adding points innity; instance usually one takes spheres classify branes space), example considering higher k-theory groups. groups together form ring one considers classifying branes. attitude dierent: everything group, taking, compactication, complex projective space, virtue giving us z every codimension. return later. following discussion tted case want express brane wrapped submanifold terms pair wrapped manifold; compactify latter complex projective variety. main case mind iib theory, space lling branes antibranes; case take, said, projective space p5, real dimension 10, ambient variety. examples talking following, however, chosen easier. make claim mathematical originality; examples clarify illustrate general discussion, also relies well-known mathematical facts. issues role grothendieck groups already considered {$9902116$}, dierent point view aim one take here. 2 2 coherent sheaves projective resolu- tions. key concept introduce, discussing grothendieck groups, coherent sheaf. sheaves generalize concept bre bundles manifold, viewed particular class sheaves, locally free ones. fibre bundles submanifold described precisely coherent sheaves. projective smooth variety x, case simplicity restrict, sheaves nitely generated ox -modules, thus (using, example, regularity presence ample invertible sheaf) admit nite projective free resolution, is, put exact sequence: 0 fn1 . . . f1 f0 c 0 (1) c coherent sheaf fk locally free. fibre bundles closed subvariety coherent sheaves (closed immersions proper, take coherent sheaves subvariety particular, locally free ones coherent sheaves), admit resolutions; see works examples. note conclusions untouched possible singularities subvarieties. general two denitions grothendieck groups. take z (respectively z) free abelian group generated locally free (respec- tively coherent) sheaves. k z/i, k z/i , (i ) ideal generated cases elements form f f f exact sequence 0 f f f 0. case smooth projective varieties, two denitions (the two groups isomorphic). particular immediately see every coherent sheaf expressed element k, dening sequence (1), dierence e f two locally free sheaves. simply means setting express bre bundle subvariety dierence two bre bundles variety. identication given tachyon condensation! see that, use grothendieck group instead topological k-theory, rst step described (the fact cancel bundle appears sides) implies second (tachyon condensation identication lower-dimensional branes). course shown isomorphism grothendieck groups here: point also essential, otherwise class found would depend projective resolution chose. although prove , check explicitly example end paper. 3 group k = k dierent k-theory various respects. first, course, working holomorphic subvarieties, choosing holo- morphic structures bundles involved. second, identify zero extensions instead direct sums. extensions topologi- cally trivial (direct sums), problem. group contain general contained k-theory (the non-complex bundles); gives us means understand brane-antibrane cong- urations represent lower dimensional branes wrapped holomorphic cycles. time group distinguishes objects k-theory same. still verify isomorphism grothendieck groups really consistent tachyon condensation already know. several examples, using basic tool sequence 0 f f(d) f(d)|d 0, (2) f locally free (alternatively, derive (3) tensoring). start brane wrapped holomorphic cycle bundle - is, coherent sheaf. express terms locally free sheaves (brane- antibrane) tachyon condensation see whether retrieve initial conguration. let us start case one brane, structure sheaf bundle (we think u (1)-bundle circle bundle inside it), suppose work x = pn. resolution depends whether subvariety complete intersection not; former case easy. case (real) codimension 2 reads 0 ox (y ) ox oy 0; (3) rst term ideal sheaf, think sheaf holomorphic functions zero along . get oy = ox ox (y ), tachyon section e f = ox(y ), hence simple zero (recall duality functions poles sections zeroes). exactly parallels already known construction brane-antibrane pair reproduces codimension 2 brane. already remarked bundle tachyon section dened class k-theory; instead, guessed way thinking minimal couple (e, f ). procedure, minimality concept minimal resolution coherent sheaf, well-known algebraic geometers. higher codimension. let us describe codimension higher, sticking case complex projective spaces. exploiting fact line bundles, case, classied z, write degrees. let d1, . . . , dl 4 degrees equations f1, . . . , fl dening subvariety, suppose complete intersection, 0 ox (d1 . . . dl) . . . ox(di1 di2) (4) i1,i2 ox(di) ox oy 0. origin resolution understood follows: v io(di) term generalization rst (from left) term (3) due fact one equation, may thought sheaf l-uples functions (f1h1, . . . , flhl); takes l-uple p fihi, next term left kernel, i.e. relations fi. always nd obvious relations fi fj fj fi = 0, generate term i,j o(d1 dj); case non complete intersections, number equations necessary dene variety would higher codimension, would extra terms. fact complete intersection case one may make (4) transparent form 0 lv . . . 2v v ox oy 0, also known koszul complex. note proceed step step: procedure, one already known involving k-theory thom isomorphism abs construction ({$9810188$}; see also {$9907140$} extensive description). see better correspondence, rst remember complex e0 d0 e1 d1 . . . dn1 en one may construct smaller complex (a map) ei ei, i=even i=odd 1e2, d2e2 + d(e0, e2, . . .) = (d0e0 + 3e4, . . .); moreover latter complex exact former is. apply sequence (4), pair bundles correspond cliord bundles (s+, s) associated conormal variety; example cliord multiplication (which viewed sum exterior product contraction) arises sum denition d. projective resolutions like also known, thought terms corresponding algebraic objects (rings modules) syzygies . lower charges. give concrete examples case non trivial line bundle (p 2)-brane. since projective spaces, 5 let us return moment point anticipated introduction. one would imagine, descriptions gave far identications dpd p system lower dimensional branes, that, xed ambient space, k-theory grothendieck group already provides classication branes dimensions. check choose space; even xed dimension p, still choose boundary conditions. amounts choosing type compactication. choose, usual, sphere; k-theory sphere z. means construction, itself, would confuse branes dierent dimensions: two dimensionally dierent branes realized dp p system. have, say, avoid hand, treating codimension separately imposing bundles depend transversal dimensions. that, nd given brane- antibrane system, (p 2) brane given certain couple (e, f ), anyway also topologically couple gives (p 4) brane. point could dierent choices boundary condi- tions (that is, compactication) give better result. instance, choosing complex projective space pn, k-theory grothendieck group isomorphic  r z/(t 1)n+1, (5) gives z even codimensional brane (the isomorphism k k-theory r given sending hyperplane h t). fact topological algebraic geometrical k-theory equal reasonable, since know pn jacobian. way trick that, choosing pn compactication space, allowed possible boundary conditions, distinguishing branes dierent dimensions. course way predicting allowed codimensions branes: cannot chose complex analytic setting, forcing even. return examples wanted give: non trivial line bun- dles (p 2) brane. easier extend line bundle one ambient space, whose divisor let us call d: indeed, applying (2), obtain 0 ox (d ) ox(d) o(d)|y 0; last term original bundle subvariety. note e f = ox(y ), should. x ideas, consider case conic p2, birationally equivalent p1. line bundle op1(2), extended p2 o(1) (henceforth op2); sequence reads 0 o(1) o(1) op1(2) 0. life harder consider instead bundle op1(1), extendable p2, since divisor intersects conic 6 once. circumvent diculty two ways. first, start projective resolution o, instead o. care- fully involves looking rings functions varieties, maps them; delve details, result turns 0 2o(1) 2o op1(1) 0 (we denote n 1 o(k) no(k)). check, let us another way, involves sequences already seen. write rst two sequences 0 op1(1) op1 op 0 (6) 0 o(2) 2o(1) op 0 p point p1 section line bundle op1(1) vanish. now, tensor hyperplane line bundle p2: get op1(1) = op1(2)op(1) = o(1)o(1)(o(1)2o+o(1)) = 2o2o(1) above. still another method would tensoring rst sequence (6) hyperplane line bundle p1, reexpressing o(1) 3o 3o(1)+o(2): gives illustration relation (t1)n+1 = 0 (5). result case reasonable conic deformed two hyperplanes touching point. nally want consider stacked branes, u (1)-bundles become u (r)- bundles. generalization represent u (r) cr; get way complex vector bundle rank r lower-dimensional brane. coherent sheaf sheaf o-modules, generators; resolution starts rox instead ox . right, since get stacked branes expect start stacked brane- antibrane pair. procedure works way, verify get desired subvariety look locus tachyon non invertible, rather zero. thank l. bonora, a. sen, a. zampa useful discussions advice.
