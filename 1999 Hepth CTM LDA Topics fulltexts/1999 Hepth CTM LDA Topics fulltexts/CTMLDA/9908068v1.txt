abstract

global canonical transformations to free chiral elds are constructed for dg models min-
imally coupled to scalar elds. the boundary terms for such canonical transformations
are shown to vanish in asymptotically static coordinates if there is no scalar eld.

1 introduction

here we consider a special class of 1+1 dimensional dilaton - gravity - matter models
(dgm) [1]. gravitational variables in these models are the metric tensor gij and
the scalar dilaton eld . the matter is represented by a scalar eld , which is
minimally coupled to the gravitational variables [2]. the lagrangian of these models
may be written in the form

l = g [r(g) + v ()  gijij/2] ,

(1)

where r is the scalar curvature, the subscripts denote partial derivatives (i =
i, etc.), except when used in gij. many models (describing black holes, strings,
cosmologies, etc.) can be written in the form (1). the formal exact solutions for
some classes of these models can be obtained by backlund transformations to free
elds [1]. recipes to nd canonical transformations to free eld for the exactly
integrable models were suggested in [3].

in what follows we study the model in the conformal at, light - like metric
ds2 = 4f (u, v)dudv, in which r = (log f )uv/f . then the general covariance is
lost but there exists residual covariance under reparametrization of light - cone
coordinates u = a(u), v = b(v), where a(u) and b(v) are arbitrary monotonic
coordinate functions.

2 equations of motion

the equations of motion can be derived by varying l with respect to the variables
gij, , and ,
(2)

f (i/f )i = (i)2/2 , (i = u, v) ,

1

uv + f v () = 0,

(log f )uv + f v () = 0 ,

uv = 0 .

(5)

these equations are not independent. thus, eqs.(2)-(4) imply eq.(5). a useful
corollary is the following: we only need to solve eqs.(3) and (4), then the scalar eld
can be derived from eqs.(2) while eq.(5) is automatically satised.

if the scalar eld is constant, we can nd the general solution to eqs.(2)-(4) in

terms of one free eld [1]. indeed, from the constraints (2) it follows that

f /u = b(v) , f /v = a(u) ,

where a(u) and b(v) are arbitrary (smooth) functions. thus

 = f ( ) , f = f ( )a(u)b(v) ,

  a(u) + b(v) ,

(6)

where f ( ) is an arbitrary function of the free eld  (u, v). this means that the
general dilaton gravity (coupled to abelian gauge elds) is a topological theory and
can be dimensionally reduced to a 1 + 0 dimensional theory [4], [1], [5], [6].

to obtain the exact form of the function f ( ), we dene a new function n() by
n () = v (). the function m  f ( ) + n() = uv/f (u, v) + n(), is locally
conserved, i.e. mu = 0 and mv = 0. thus, we nd

 = z [m  n()]1 d ,

(7)

and this implicitly denes the general solution in terms of the free eld  = a(u) +
b(v). if n(0) = m, f (a, b) = f ( ) = m  n(0) = 0, the function  () is innite
at  = 0, and there is a horizon at  = .
if the functions a(u) and b(v) are monotonic, the transformation from variables
(u, v) to variables (a, b) can be used. the solution is static in the coordinates (a, b)
(it depends on  = a + b only).

the general dgm (1) is not integrable. however, there exists a class of the
potentials v () for which the general solution to eqs.(2)-(4) can be found in terms
of two free elds, or equivalently, in terms of two pairs of chiral functions. in what
follows they are denoted by a(u), b(v), a(u), and b(v).

3 canonical transformations to free elds

to study quantum properties of the models, it is useful to nd a canonical trans-
formation to free elds. with this aim, we rewrite the model in the canonical form.
let us write the two-dimensional metric in the form

ds2 = e2 h2 dt2 + ( dt + dr)2i ,

(8)

where (u, v) and (u, v) play the role of the lapse function and of the shift vector,
respectively;  = (log f )/2. we denote the derivative with respect to t = u + v by
the dot, and the derivative with respect to r = u  v by the prime,

t = (u + v)/2 , r = (u  v)/2 .

(9)

when, using (8), the action (1) can be written in the hamiltonian form (see e.g. [7])

s = z d2x(cid:16)  + 

 + 

  h  p(cid:17) ,

(10)

where  = 2 ,  = 2 , and  =  are the conjugate momenta to , , and
;  and  are the lagrangian multipliers; h and p are the constraints:

h = /2 + 2(  )  e2v () + (2

 + 2)/2 ,

to get a canonical transformation to free els let us rewrite the symplectic 2-form

p =   

 +  +  .

 = z dr (   +    +   )

(11)

in the new parametrization given by the exact solution of the lagrange equations.
in the exact solution, written in terms of free elds, we will substitute the free chiral
functions by arbitrary functions and the derivatives with respect to u, v by r

b(v)  b(u, v) ,
b(v)  b(u, v) ,
v  2r ,
since 2r = u  v (this recipe was proposed in [3].).

a(u)  a(u, v) ,
a(u)  a(u, v) ,
u  2r ,

for the cghs model [2], v = g = const, the global solution can be rewritten as

 = log(4ab)/2 ,
 = 2g(ab  ab)  2a + 2b ,

 = gab + a + b ,
 =  log(a) + log(b) .

thus, we get

 = 2r dr [(log a)  a + (log b)  b] + b0

= 2r dr [(log(a/a))  a  (log(b/b))  b] + b0 ,
here b0 is the boundary term, which arises from integration by parts,

b0 = z d [   log(a/b)  2ga  b] ,

(12)

(13)

(14)

and  is dened in (12). to rewrite the constraints c  = (h  p )/2 in the simple
form [7], [8],
(15)

c  = x 

 + (  )2/4 ,

we can choose the canonical coordinate x + and momentum + in one of the fol-
lowing four forms (i = 1, ..., 4):

x +
+

i =
i = 2(a/a) ,

a ,

(a/a) ,

2a ,

a ,

log(a/a) ,

2(log(a/a)) ,

2a .

(16)

the canonical coordinate x  and momentum  can be chosen independently of
x +, +. altogether this gives 4 4 = 16 dierent canonical transformations to the
chiral coordinates and momenta

ij = z dr (x +

j  
where b0 is given by (14), i, j = 1, . . . , 4

b1 = 2r d [a  (a/a)] ,

b3 = 2r d [a   log(a/a)] ,

+
+

b2 = 0 ,
b4 = 0 ,

(17)

(18)

and 

bi are obtained from +

bi by substituting a with b and a with b.

in what follows we choose i = j = 1, x + = a, x  = b. this choice of canonical
coordinates seems natural because a and b are the global coordinate functions on the
maximally extended solution. thus, the canonical transformation is global. below
we will write the global canonical transformations for other dg models.

since the functions x  are monotonic coordinate functions, we can include x 

into the lagrange multipliers [8], [9], and the new constraints will be

c   c /x 

=  + (  )2/(4x 

) .

(19)

we can simplify the form of the boundary term by choosing a special asymptotic
behavior of the coordinate functions a and b. if we choose, up to arbitrary linear
transformations, the static form of the coordinate functions,

a = eu ,

b = ev ,

on the left and the right space-like innities, respectively, and require that there
are constant scalar elds at innities (a  0 , b  0 for r  ), we will
completely get rid of the boundary term. moreover, in this way we can get rid of
the boundary term for any dg model with constant scalar elds. indeed, for any
model ofthis kind it is easy to prove the following statement. for all the solutions
in the static parametrization (a, b) the boundary term is

b = z d [   log(a/b)] .

(20)

4 conclusions

starting from global solutions of exactly integrable models we have constructed
global canonical transformations to free chiral elds. monotonic chiral coordinate
functions of the global solution (in the conformal metric) can be chosen as new
canonical coordinates. this choice of canonical coordinates guarantees the global
character of the canonical transformation. we can rewrite the constraints as linear
functions of momenta canonically conjugate to coordinate functions. to get rid of
the boundary term in the canonical transformation we demand the static form of
the solution (with a constant scalar eld) at spatial innities.

let us compare the constructions of the canonical transformations to free chiral
elds for dierent dg models. the cghs model is the simplest integrable model.
it has only one static solution. the coordinate functions of the global solution
were chosen as canonical coordinates. we get rid of the boundary term of the
canonical transformation, if the global coordinate functions are chosen static at
spatial innities, and the scalar eld is constant.

the generalized cghs model (v = g1 + g2) has several static solutions. the
global static solution can be chosen as a vacuum and may be used in the boundary
conditions to get rid of the boundary term. to study the solutions obtained from the
periodic static solutions with horizons, we have to restrict the manifold to a cylinder.
then we may completely get rid of the boundary term by choosing periodic boundary
conditions for free chiral elds [3].

for the bi-liouville model (v = (g+eg  geg)/g) minimally coupled to one
scalar eld we can construct canonical transformations to free chiral elds and choose
the boundary conditions similarly to the cghs (for sign{g+g} = 1) or the gen-
eralized cghs (for sign{g+g} = 1) and get rid of the boundary term.

this investigation was partially supported by the russian foundation for basic
research (project 97-01-01041), and by intas (project 93-127-ext).
