abstract

radiative corrections arising from the axial coupling of charged fermions to a constant
vector b can induce a lorentz- and cpt-violating chern-simons term in the qed
action. we calculate the exact one-loop correction to this term keeping the full b
dependence, and show that in the physically interesting cases it coincides with the
lowest-order result. the eect of regularization and renormalization and the implica-
tions of the result are briey discussed.

the possible breaking of cpt and lorentz invariance due to non-conventional
physics has been recently addressed by constructing extensions of the standard model
that include tiny non-invariant renormalizable terms (see ref.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and refer-
ences therein; the possibility of dynamical lorentz symmetry breaking has been con-
sidered in ref. [6]). in particular, it is interesting to consider the qed sector of such
extensions. we shall only be concerned here with the lorentz-violating cpt-odd terms,
which for a single charged (dirac) fermion read

s cpt = z d4x(cid:20)a   b5 +

stringent experimental bounds can be put on the pure-photon cpt-violating term [7],
which is of the chern-simons form [8] (a disputed claim exists, however, for a nonzero ~k
[9, 10]). moreover, this term introduces tachyonic modes in the photon spectrum and,
for a timelike k, a vacuum instability [7, 11]. hence, both experiment and theory
suggest that k should vanish (at least in the timelike case). a natural question is then
whether a non-zero k can be induced by radiative corrections involving lorentz and
cpt-violating couplings in other sectors of the total low-energy theory. in that case,
the tight bounds on k would also constrain these sectors. in the qed extension such
corrections can only arise from the axial-vector term, with coupling b.

several authors have tried to answer this question. all calculations have been
performed to one loop and at leading order in b, and have rendered a nite result.
however, despite some early claims of denite values for the induced k [3, 12], it seems
quite clear now that the result is ambiguous [2, 13, 14, 15], i.e., depends on the details of
the high-energy theory [16]. it is our purpose here to calculate the one-loop corrections
to all orders in the coupling b and discuss the relevant issues in the light of the exact
result. after this work had been completed, we learnt that j.m. chung had carried out
the same calculation (for b2 < m2), with the same result [17].

the relevant quantity is the parity-odd part of the vacuum polarization, which

must be of the form


odd(p) = bpk(p, b, m),

(2)

where p is the external momentum and the function k is a scalar. the contribution
to the induced chern-simons term in the eective action is given by

(k) =

1
2

bk(0, b, m) ,

(3)

and must be a function of b2/m2. to one-loop, the only contributing diagram coincides
with the standard one-loop vacuum-polarization but with the usual fermion propagator
replaced by the b-exact propagator

sb(k) =

i

6 k  m  6 b5

.

(4)

we use a hermitian 5 with tr{5} = 4i and g = diag(1, 1, 1, 1).
in order to keep the full dependence on b we must rationalize the propagator. we nd

sb(k) = i

(6 k + m  6 b5)(k2  m2  b2 + [6 k, 6 b]5)

(k2  m2  b2)2 + 4(k2b2  (k  b)2)

,

(5)

which agrees with the expression given in ref. [1]. as discussed there, this propagator
has four poles that occur at real values of k0. the one-loop vacuum polarization reads

 (p) = z d4k

(2)4 tr {sb(k) sb(k  p)} .

(6)

this integral is linearly divergent, but, as we shall see, the divergent terms contributing
to 
odd cancel. eq. 5 allows us to compute the trace in the numerator, which for the
odd terms in b reduces to pf(k, p, b, m), with

f(k, p, b, m) = bf (1)

 (k, p, b, m) + kf (2)

 (k, p, b, m)

=  4inbh2m2(k2  m2  b2) + (k2 + m2 + b2)((k  p)2  m2 + b2) + 4k  b(k  p)  bi

 2kh(k2  m2 + b2)(k  p)  b + ((k  p)2  m2 + b2)k  bio .

(7)

the linearly divergent term has disappeared, leaving an integral which is just loga-
rithmically divergent by power counting. since we are only interested in k(p, b, m) for
p = 0 and, luckily, no term with bk appears, we can simplify the calculation by
setting p = 0 in f(k, p, b, m) and in the denominator of the integral. we are then left
with two integrals which only depend on b and m. the rst one is already of the form
bk1(0, b, m) . the second integral must also give a result of the form bk2(0, b, m),
and k2(0, b, m) can be calculated multiplying the integral by b and dividing by b2 (as
long as b is not lightlike). in this way, we arrive at the following expression:

k(0, b, m) = 4iz d4k

in order to calculate this integral, we go to euclidean space via a wick rotation of k0.
to calculate the resulting integral using spherical coordinates, we perform an analytic
continuation to be = (ib0,~b) and get

k(0, be , m) = 4z d4ke

where the scalar product is euclidean. one can directly see at this stage that the result
must be nite. indeed, for very large k2 the leading term in the integrand has the form

(10)

which gives a vanishing result if the integral is done symmetrically. the other terms are
power-counting nite. this also shows an ambiguity in the induced term: the integral of
the expression (10) is regularization dependent! we shall further discuss this issue later

this integral is well-behaved for large |ke|. note the appearance of the sign function.
for m 6= 0, the nal result is (going back to the minkowskian b):

 (k) =

 (k) =   3

|b2|! b ,

if b2 > m2 .

(13)

(14)

for any timelike b and for a spacelike b with |b2| < m2, eq. (13) is the relevant
one. surprisingly enough, in these cases our calculation to all orders in b gives the
same result as the one obtained in the b-linear aproximation of ref. [15]. obviously,
perturbation theory about b = 0 does not detect the dierent behaviour we have
found for b2 > m2. on the other hand, continuity in b2 implies that the lightlike case,
b2 = 0, is also given by eq. (13). in fact, dimensional analysis shows that the b-linear
aproximation is exact for vanishing b2. note also in pass that for the ne-tuned value
b2 =  16

7 m2, a vanishing (k) is obtained.

if the fermion is massless, m = 0, we nd (k) =  1

162 b for any kind of b. in
this simple case, there are at least three other possible ways of calculating the induced
term, which give the same answer:

1. a simpler b-exact propagator can obtained for m = 0:

sb(k) = i

(6 k + 6 b5)(k2 + b2  2p  b5)

(k + b)2(k  b)2

.

(15)

the calculation can then be simplied using feynman parameters and the result
(k) =  1

162 b is found for any b.

4

2. perturbatively, one can perform just a b-linear calculation, since in the massless
case the higher-order terms vanish for dimensional reasons. from eq. (14) in
ref. [15], the same (k) results. the only contribution comes from the surface
term in eq. (10) of jackiw-kosteleckys calculation.

3. a conrmation of the same result, non-perturbative in b and in the ne-structure
constant, is provided in ref. [13] (following a suggestion by d. colladay): an
anomalous chiral redenition of the fermion elds allows to get rid of the cou-
pling to b, so that the contribution (to all orders) to k(0, b, 0) comes from the
corresponding fujikawa jacobian. up to the unavoidable ambiguity (which in this
method comes from the denition of the current operator),  1
162 b is obtained
again.

an infrared regularization can spoil this result. for instance, giving the fermion a small
3
162 b in the timelike-b case. at any rate this is just
mass obviously shifts it back to
a formal discussion, since there are no massless electromagnetically-charged fermions
in nature.

we have also calculated the integral in eq. 8 directly in minkowski space, using
rst the residuos method to perform the integration on k0, and integrating on ~k af-
terwards. although the result diers by a constant, because k0 and ~k are not treated
symmetrically, the same dependence on b2 and m2 is found.

it is rather striking that the contributions to (k) of diagrams with more than
one insertion of 6 b5 vanish. we have explicitly checked that this is indeed the case at
order bb2. at this and higher orders, all integrals are nite by power-counting, and
hence unambigous. s. coleman has observed that the vanishing of these higher order
contributions can be explained by his argument with s.l. glashow in ref. [3], which can
1. consider a two-photon amplitude
be applied to nite diagrams with insertions of 6 b5
with n > 1 insertions of 6 b5. the idea is to let each of the two photons carry dierent
momenta, p and q (the insertions carry non-zero momentum then). gauge invariance
implies transversality in each of the photons. dierentiating each of the transversality
conditions with respect to the corresponding momentum, one learns that the amplitude
is o(pq). it follows that when ones goes to equal momenta, q = p, the amplitude is
o(p2). since the chern-simons term in the eective action is o(p), one concludes that
this amplitude does not contribute to (k). in ref. [3], this argument is proved to be
valid to any order in the ne-structure constant. note, however, that it does not apply
to diagrams with just one insertion, due to the presence of triangular anomalies [15].

let us discuss now how regularization and renormalization aect the result. this is
an important point because the complete s qed + s cpt theory is not nite and requires
renormalization (and, furthermore, renormalization is also relevant in a nite theory [18,
19]). the exact decomposition sb(k) = s(k)  isb(k)6 b5s(k) performed in ref. [15],
shows that the ambiguities can only come from the lowest-order piece, the rest being
nite by power counting. therefore, the ambiguity in the induced chern-simons part

can be discussed either using the linear aproximation, the one-loop exact calculation
or the path-integral approach of ref. [13]. from the observation made above, it is
clear that the result of our calculation would be changed by any regularization that
destroys the spherical symmetry (in four-dimensional euclidean space) of the high-
energy behaviour. this is the case of dimensional regularization, which breaks the (four-
dimensional) tracelessness of the combination kk  1
4  k2. the converse is not true:
even if a given regularization preserves spherical symmetry, it may invalidate the steps
we followed to arrive at eq. (9). this happens again in dimensional regularization2.
in general, dierent regularizations (or subtractions) will render dierent results, even
if they preserve gauge invariance. this is apparent in dierential renormalization,
which makes the ambiguity explicit [14] (the situation in the gauge-invariant method
of constrained dierential renormalization [25] is similar to the one in dimensional
regularization [26]).

as a matter of fact, independently of how one regulates and subtracts the divergent
integrals, one always has the freedom to add any (renormalizable) nite counterterm
that is allowed by the relevant symmetries of the theory [27]. this is also true when
the radiative corrections to that term are nite [19]. in the present case, this means
that, from the point of view of perturbative renormalization theory, the induced (k)
can have any value, for it is not protected by any symmetry [15] (except cpt and
lorentz invariance, but we just broke them). the interesting conclusion of our study is
the following: if the regulator and the subtraction rule are mass-independent, a mass-
independent result will be obtained to all orders in b in the physically-relevant cases,
as the cpt- and lorentz-violating terms coecients are much smaller than the mass
of any electromagnetically-charged fermion and eq. (13) provides the induced term in
this situation.

in ref. [2] an interesting discussion was made regarding the possible vanishing
of the induced chern-simons term due to an anomaly-cancellation mechanism in the
high-energy theory (of course, we consider now several fermion species). essentially,
the argument goes as follows. from the point of view of a more fundamental theory,
the diagrams with one6 b5 insertion (at one loop) can be viewed as the corresponding
triangular diagrams with the same photon legs and a third leg involving a coupling to an
axial vector, in the limit in which there is zero momentum transfer to the axial-vector
leg and the latter is replaced with a vacuum expectation value. the condition for the
cancellation of the anomalies ocurring in these diagrams then implies that the induced
term also cancels. this argument requires that the term induced by dierent fermions

2in the presence of chiral objects, several denitions of dimensional regularization exist. the naive
one, usually used in anomaly-free theories, takes an anticomuting 5 and is inconsistent with the usual
trace relations [20]. it is known to produce a wrong (zero) value for the triangular anomaly, which is
closely related to our problem. on the other hand, the consistent denitions of t hooft and veltman [21]
give rise to spurious anomalies that must be corrected with nite counterterms [22]. in our calculation
we have used an anticommuting 5 to invert the kinetic term and then taken usual four-dimensional
traces. finally, dimensional reduction [23] is also ambiguous (even at the one-loop level) in the presence
of chiral objects [24] . this short discussion should make clear that one must be careful when applying
dimensional regularization to this kind of calculations.

be the same. this is true if the induced term contains no mass dependence and, besides,
a universal and mass-independent renormalization prescription is adopted for all the
contributing diagrams3. our result shows that the rst requirement, which is trivial at
the b-linear order, holds to all orders in b. invoking the addler-bardeen theorem, the
argument for the vanishing of the induced term was also generalized in ref. [2] to higher
loops. again, this is only valid if no mass-dependence is introduced by higher-order
corrections. that this is the case follows from the combination of coleman-glashows
argument and addler-bardeen theorem. summarizing: in the context of ref. [2], the
cancellation of anomalies in the fundamental theory imply the vanishing of the induced
term to any order in b and in the ne-structure constant, if a mass-independent scheme
is used.

on the other hand, we have till now neglected the possible inuence of the a term
in eq. (1). in principle, corrections of order a2b and higher could appear, and they
are not necessarily smaller than the ones we have been dealing with. actually, one
can include the eect of a to all orders just by considering the corresponding a- and
b-exact propagator. this propagator is just the one in eq. (5) but with k substituted
by k  a. the vector a behaves then like an external momentum which appears in
all the propagators of the loop. since there are no derivative couplings, a shift in the
loop momentum k  k + a can completely eliminate a, so the result is not aected.
(of course, this shift is also subjected to regularization ambiguities.) as a matter of
fact, the term proportional to a can be eliminated from the action s qed + s cpt by
a eld redenition of the form  = exp(ia  x) [1]. the eect of other sectors (like
the cpt-even lorentz-violating extension of qed considered in ref. [2]) can also be
studied with these techniques, i.e., incorporating the corresponding fermion bilinears
into the exact propagator. this is beyond the scope of the present work.

let us nally stress that even if the radiative corrections to the chern-simons term
cancel for some reason, it is still possible to add a nite counterterm and get a non-zero
(k). this is a sign of the fact that we have no right to put k = 0 at tree level,
unless there is some symmetry in the high-energy theory that imposes this value. of
course, it is comparison with experiment that tells us to set k + (k) = 0 but, in the
absence of a proper symmetry, we are facing a problem of naturalness. nevertheless,
the anomaly-cancellation argument shows that this problem does not come from other
sectors of the low-energy theory, and, from a practical point of view, allows one to put
k = 0 in the tree-level action, as long as a consistent mass-independent scheme is used
in the calculations.
