abstract

we construct d = 4 type i vacua with massless content remarkably close to

that of the standard model of particle physics. they are tachyon-free non-

supersymmetric models which are obtained starting with a standard d = 4,

n = 1 compact type iib orientifold and adding the same number of dp-branes

and anti-dp-branes distributed at dierent points of the underlying orbifold.

supersymmetry-breaking is felt by the observable world either directly, by grav-

ity mediation or gauge mediation, depending on the brane conguration. we

construct several simple three generation examples with the gauge group of the

standard model or its left-right symmetric extensions. the models contain a

number of u(1) gauge groups whose anomalies are cancelled by a generalized

green-schwarz mechanism. these u(1)s are broken but may survive as global

symmetries providing for a avour structure to the models. the value of the

string scale may be lowered down to the intermediate scale (as required in the

gravity mediation case) or down to 1-100 tev for the non-susy models. thus

the present models are the rst semirealistic string vacua realizing the possibil-

ity of a low string scale. the unbalanced force between the pairs of dp- and

anti-dp-branes provides for an eect which tends to compactify some of the ex-

tra dimensions but no others. this could provide a new mechanism for radius

stabilization.

1 introduction

during the past few years a beautiful picture has emerged regarding the structure of

string theory, in which all dierent supersymmetric theories appear as dierent points

of a general moduli space. understanding this moduli space is one of the big open

questions in this theory. however, one of the few things we do know is that we do not

live in such space, since supersymmetry is not a symmetry of nature. therefore it is

mandatory to consider the structure of non-supersymmetric strings.

recently there has been some progress in understanding non supersymmetric string

models, by studying the dynamics of brane-antibrane systems [1] and other construc-

tions [2]. this study has direct phenomenological interest due to the observation that

the fundamental string scale is not necessarily of the order of the planck mass and can

be substantially lower [3, 4, 5]. in particular type i strings may have very low funda-

mental scale as long as the size of the extra dimensions is large enough. therefore we

may in principle have a nonsupersymmetric type i model with supersymmetry broken

only at the electroweak scale, something impossible to realize in the old perturbative

heterotic models.

the construction of four-dimensional models from type i theories has been the

subject of research only recently [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] , since for many years the

activity concentrated mostly on heterotic strings. standard-like models from heterotic

strings have been constructed since several years already [14, 15, 16]. despite the

remarkable similarity with the standard model of particle physics, they all suer from

dierent problems. in particular the standard questions of supersymmetry breaking

and moduli stabilisation could not be approached from a string theory point of view.

on the other hand, supersymmetric type i model building has appeared to be very

restrictive and no quasi-realistic models have emerged to date [17] . this diculty

is related to the conditions coming from the cancellation of ramond-ramond(rr)

tadpoles which are extremely restrictive.

in spite of recent interest in d-brane scenarios with a lowered string scale [18, 5, 19,

20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], the studies presented in the literature up to now have

used the d-brane techniques more as an inspiration than as an explicit tool to construct

new phenomenologically interesting string vacua. a number of phenomenological issues

have been discussed but never based on specic semirealistic string vacua with d-

branes. one of the purposes of the present article is to ll this gap and provide specic

consistent string vacua in which these issues may be addressed.

we present the rst standard-like models explicitly constructed from type i strings.

1

this is a new class of vacua based on n = 1 toroidal type iib orientifolds plus the
inclusion of branes and anti-branes, generally stuck at dierent orbifold xed points

[29]. the presence of these brane anti-brane pairs in the vacuum makes substantially

easier the construction of tadpole-free models. supersymmetry is only broken in some

subsector of the theory by the presence of anti-dp-branes which break supersymmetry.

since these anti-dp-branes may be isolated in the bulk of compact space the n = 1

sector of the theory may feel susy-breaking only in a suppressed manner. we then

have explicit string realizations of the gravity mediated scenario. in other models the

spectrum is non-supersymmetric or else feels susy-breaking by gauge mediation. our

models have three families of quarks and leptons and are remarkably simple. we will

present explicit examples with the standard model gauge group and also left-right

symmetric models as well as models of the pati-salam type.

the structure of this paper is as follows. in the next section we give an overview

of the orientifold constructions of four-dimensional chiral type i strings, including the

recent development of reference [29], where branes and anti-branes are included in

a consistent manner, cancelling all tadpoles and projecting out tachyonic states. in

section 3 we perform a general treatment of the non-supersymmetric models in the

presence of one wilson line which serves as the basis for our construction. we provide

the general massless spectrum for this class of theories and show how u(1) anomalies

are cancelled via a generalized green-schwarz mechanism along the lines of ref. [30].

in section 4.1 we present explicit examples of quasi-realistic three-generation models

where only branes are stuck at xed points whereas anti-branes live in the bulk. since

the anti-branes break supersymmetry, these are explicit examples of gravity mediated

supersymmetry breaking, which then ask for a fundamental string scale to be an in-

termediate scale [25]. other example of gravity mediated models in which both branes

and anti-branes are stuck at xed points is provided in section 4.3. section 4.2 deals

with models with branes stuck at some points and anti-branes stuck at dierent points.

there are elds in these models carrying quantum numbers of the anti-branes which

can mediate supersymmetry breaking either directly or through gauge interactions. in

this case we would need the fundamental scale to be as low as the tev scale [4, 18, 5].

in chapter 5 we study a number of generic dynamical issues in this class of models.

we show how the string scale can be lowered down to the intermediate scale (as required

in the gravity mediated models of sections 4.1 and 4.3) or below (as required in the

non-susy models of section 4.2). we discuss the presence of attractive forces between

branes and anti-branes as well as other eects which may lead to a potential for the

2

moduli [29] . we also study the general structure of yukawa couplings and show how

gauge couplings may naturally unify at the intermediate scale in some particular gravity

mediated models of the class discussed in section 4.1.

chapter 6 is left for our nal conclusions and comments. the appendices provide

for additional models which exemplify some of the issues discussed in the text.

2 type iib orientifolds in the presence of anti-dp-

branes

in this section we introduce our notation and projection rules for obtaining the massless

spectrum in d = 4 dimensions. we also comment on dierent alternatives for building

stable non-supersymmetric vacua. we mainly follow references [11] and [29].

a type iib orientifold in four dimensions is obtained when such theory, toroidally
compactied on t 6, is divided out by the joint action of world sheet parity symmetry

, exchanging left and right movers, and a discrete symmetry group g1 (like zzn or
zznzzm ), acting crystalographically on t 6. the  action can be also accompanied by
extra operations thus leading to a general orientifold group g1 + g2 with hh  g1
for h, h  g2 in what follows we mainly consider zzn twists. twist eigenvalues,
associated to complex compactied coordinates ya (a = 1, . . . , 3), are encoded into
the vector v = 1
n (1, 2, 3) where a are integers. such integers are specied by the
number of required unbroken supersymmetries on each movers sector. we choose them
to satisfy 1 + 2 + 3 = 0. a classication for the n =  case may be found in [31].
orientifolding closed type iib string introduces a klein-bottle unoriented world-sheet.

amplitudes on such a surface contain tadpole divergences. tadpoles may be generically

interpreted as unbalanced orientifold planes charges under rr form potentials. such

unphysical divergences can be eliminated by introducing dp-branes, carrying opposite

charges.

in this way, divergences occurring in the open string sector cancel up the closed

sector ones and produce a consistent theory. moreover, sets of branes and antibranes

can be consistently introduced in order to cancel rr tadpoles. even though the mod-

els are non-supersymmetric (due to the presence of the anti-d-branes), it has been

shown in [29] that models free of tachyons can be easily constructed. since, in the

orientifolds we are considering, supersymmetry is preserved in the closed string sector,

and is only broken in the open string sector by the presence of the anti-d-branes, most

of the usual techniques in supersymmetric orientifolds hold [32, 6, 7, 8, 11]. hence, we

3

focus on the open string sector. open string states are denoted by |, abipq
ab. here,
 refers to world-sheet degrees of freedom whereas a, b are chan-paton indices associ-
ated to the open string endpoints lying on dp-branes and dq-branes respectively. pq

is the chan-paton, hermitian matrix, containing the gauge group structure informa-
tion. analogously, pq (pq) is introduced for open strings ending at dp, dq-antibranes

( dp antibrane, dq-brane, etc.). we will denote these situations generically by in-

troducing capital indices p = p, p and q = q, q. the action of an element of the

orientifold group on chan-paton factors is achieved by a unitary matrix g,p such that
g : p q  g,p p q1
g,q. we denote the matrices associated to the zzn orbifold twist
k and , acting on a p-brane, as k,p and ,p respectively. consistency under group
transformations imposes restrictions on the twist matrices g,p (see for instance [11]).
a consistent choice for world sheet parity action representation, which we follow below

is

,9 = t
,9
,5 = t

,5

(2.1)

also, generic matrices for the zzn orbifold twist, with n = 2m (n = 2m + 1), can be
provided. they can be dened as

1,p = (1,p , 

1,p )

(2.2)

with  denoting complex conjugation and where  is a np  np diagonal matrix given
by

1,p = diag (   , n vj inp

j

,   , n vm inp

m

)

(2.3)

j=1 np
j

is the number of p-branes. the choice vj = j
with  = e2i/n and 2np = pm
n
with j = 0, . . . , m corresponds to an action with vector structure  (n
1,p = 1) while
vj = 2j1
1,p =
1)1. in order to compute the spectrum, it proves useful to associate a shift vector
v p , with vj coordinates, to the twist matrix 1,p . namely,

2n with j = 1, . . . , m describes an action without vector structure (n

1,p  v p = (v1, . . . , vm )

(2.4)

the models discussed below are mainly based on zz3 orientifolds. the twist matrix
and shift vector in such case are

the consistency constraint (associated to group operation (k)2 = 2k)


k,p = ,p k,p ,p

(2.6)

(2.7)

is satised with the twist matrices dened in (2.3). the requirement of tadpoles can-

cellation leads to further restrictions on twist matrices. such constraints have been

extensively discussed in the literature for supersymmetric orientifolds. it was shown

in [29] that essentially the same constraints are valid, when antibranes are present,
if tr k,p is replaced by (tr k,p  tr k,p) in the tadpole cancellation equations of the
supersymmetric case and the added number of branes and anti-branes is the same. we

refer to this point when we construct specic models.

2.1 the massless spectrum

the rules for computing the massless spectrum in an array of branes and antibranes

were derived in [29]. in the case of supersymmetric orientifolds, it was shown in ref.

[11] that computation of spectra is greatly simplied if a cartan-weyl basis is chosen.

let us recall the basic ingredients of such a construction and indicate how this is

easily generalized to uncover the description of systems containing both branes and

antibranes. in a cartan-weyl basis, chan-paton generators are organized into charged
generators a = ea, a = 1,   , dim gp  rank gp , and cartan algebra generators
i = hi, i = 1,   , rank gp , where gp is the gauge group on the p-brane. if a vector
h = (h1, . . . , hrank gp ) is dened, then

[h, ea] = aea

(2.8)

where the (rank gp )-dimensional vector a is the root vector associated to the generator
ea. matrices 1,p (and their powers) represent the action of the zzn group on chan-
paton factors, and they correspond to elements of a discrete subgroup of the abelian

group spanned by the cartan generators. thus they can be written as

1,p = e2iv ph

(2.9)

5

generically, invariance of open string massless states under the orientifold group action

in p p sectors leads to constrains on chan-paton matrices of the form

 = ,p t 1
,p
 = e2i k
n ,p  1
,p

(2.10)

(2.11)

the rst equation, imposed by  orientifold projection, performs a rst selec-
tion of allowed p weight vectors. the second one, required for invariance under
orbifold twists, further projects such vectors through the simple constraint p .v p =
k
n mod z. for instance, in 55 sectors the projections for d53-branes at xed points
are given by

(0) = ,5 (0) 1
,5
(i) = e2iva ,5 (i) 1
,5

(0) = ,5 (0)t
(i) = ,5 (i)t

1
,5
1
,5

(2.12)

with positive sign for a = 1, 2 and negative for a = 3. the projections are the same for
both bosonic and fermionic states, thus leading to n = 1 supermultiplets. the  pro-
jections, with ,5 dened in 2.6, select the sp(2n5) root vectors s = (1,1, 0 . . . 0)
and l = (2, 0 . . . 0) (and cartan generators) when the minus sign in the rst equa-
tion in (2.11) is present. if there is instead a plus sign, long root vectors are absent.
hence, (0) constraint on the left

a  v p = 0 mod z

(2.13)

selects the gauge group, a subgroup of sp(2n5) whereas matter states correspond to
charged generators with

a  v p = va mod z

(2.14)

with va = a/n, a = 1, 2, 3, the components of the vector that denes the orbifold
twist. the adequate  vectors must be used in each complex direction.

recall that in supersymmetric orientifolds with d5-branes (thus with even zzn
twists ) at xed points, tadpole equations generically require shift vectors without

vector structure and thus, long root vectors do not contribute to the massless spectrum

[11]. however, the situation is dierent when antibranes are also present. in this case

even twists with vector structure or odd twist with d5-branes and d5-antibranes

can also appear. for instance, long root vectors complete symmetric representations

of unitary groups, not present in supersymmetric cases.

similar considerations are valid when dealing with 55 sectors. exactly the same

projections apply to ns states while an extra minus sign appears for r states in the

6

 projections. in mixed sectors, pq ( pq = 59, 59, 59 etc.), with string endpoints
lying on dierent kinds of branes, the subset of roots of gp  gq of the form

p q = (wp ; wq) = (1, 0,   , 0;1, 0,   , 0)

(2.15)

must be considered. in these cases, orientifold projection maps pq into qp sector

and, thus, it imposes no restrictions on the spectrum. the relevant phases for ns and r

states in each sector, due to orbifold action, can be read from [29]. let us consider, for
instance, projections in 59 and 59 sectors. recall that ns states are labeled by |s1, s2i
so(4) spinor weight while r states correspond to |s0; s3i spinor weights (sj =  1
2 )
where s0 denes space-time chirality . gso projection demands s1 = s2 and s0 = s3
in 59 sector, whereas opposite signs are needed in 59 sector. for both, bosons and

fermions in 59 sector we must have

(95)  v (95) = 

1
2

(v1 + v2) mod z

(2.16)

with positive and negative signs corresponding to s1 = s2 =  1
respectively. for ns states in 59 sector we have,

2 and s0 = s3 =  1

2

(95)  v (95) = 

1
2

(v1  v2) mod z

(2.17)

where positive and negative signs correspond to s1 = s2 =  1
projection on r states requires

2. finally, orbifold

(95)  v (95) = 

1
2

v3 mod z

(2.18)

with plus and minus signs corresponding to s0 = s3 =  1
2 . notice that this last
condition is similar to 2.16 but there the plus sign corresponds to s0 = 1
2, i.e. positive
chirality fermions, while here it describes negative chirality ones (we are using v1 + v2 +
v3 = 0).

2.2 tachyon free non-supersymmetric models

generic models with branes and antibranes will contain tachyonic states whenever

brane-antibrane pairs of the same type coincide. more precisely, tachyons can be

present in 99 sectors or 5l5l sectors, with 5d-branes and 5d-antibranes at the same
xed point l and whenever their chan-paton twist matrices do overlap [29].

once the origin of tachyonic elds is identied dierent ways for building tachyon

free theories open up [29]. thus, models with branes of only one type (say d9-branes)

7

and antibranes of the other (5-antibrane) are automatically tachyon free. another

possibility is to consider non-overlapping chan-paton twist matrices for the coincident

branes and the antibranes. a third way is to place branes and antibranes at dierent

xed points (or have dierent wilson lines, in a t-dual description) of the internal

space. it is this last route the one we will mainly pursue in building our models so let

us further comment on it.

on the one hand such kind of models indicates an attractive possibility for breaking

supersymmetry. namely, non-supersymmetric antibrane sectors (at some xed points)

could transmit supersymmetry breaking to the supersymmetric brane sector (at dier-

ent xed points) through the exchange of bulk elds. however, the situation is more

subtle. if branes (or antibranes) are not really stuck at the xed point, they will be

able to move through the bulk as a dynamical brane. since brane-antibrane systems

develop a net attractive force between them, they will eventually come to the top of

each other and annihilate into the vacuum. thus, if brane-antibrane annihilation is

completely successful and all antibranes disappear, we will end up with a stable su-

persymmetric vacuum. in such a case, non-supersymmetric models should be viewed

as excitations of a supersymmetric vacuum. interestingly enough there are situations

in which, due to local obstructions, only partial, or not annihilation at all, is allowed.

these appear as true stable vacua with both, supersymmetric and non supersymmetric

sectors. in the following sections we will use two dierent ways for trapping branes:

i. through tadpole conditions:

whenever orientifold planes rr twisted elds charges are not vanishing, branes

must be locally introduced in order to cancel them. depending on the specic form

of twist matrices, antibranes are also needed for such a cancellation. even though

dierent congurations of branes and antibranes might be possible, antibranes cannot

completely annihilate. let us briey illustrate the idea in the zz3 orientifold example
which we further develop in next section. in this case, tadpole cancellation requires

[29]

tr ,9 + 3(tr ,5,l  tr ,5,l) = 4

(2.19)

where l = 1, . . . , 9 denotes the nine orbifold xed points in the rst two complex

planes. also the number of vebranes and antibranes must be the same. notice

that absence of antibranes implies that neither 5d-branes are present and the super-
symmetric orientifold condition [7, 8] tr ,9 = 4 is recovered. notice instead that
choosing tr ,9 6= 4 inevitably demands the presence of branes and/or antibranes at

8

all xed points 2 as mentioned, dierent arrays may be possible. in some situations

adding d5-branes (and no anti-d5-branes) at xed points may be enough to achieve

the twisted tadpole cancellation above. nevertheless, since the same number of an-

tibranes is required, they must be present in the bulk. also congurations of branes

and antibranes distributed among the xed points are possible. examples of such sit-

uations are provided in section 4. recall that, whereas in the supersymmetric case the

tadpole conditions have a unique solution, a variety of non-supersymmetric solutions

are possible.

ii. by sitting isolated branes at orientifold, but not orbifold xed points.

assume that zz3 orbifold twist generators and r orientifold action, where r is
a zz2 generator, are present in the orientifold group. this is the case for instance
of zz6 orientifold, where r is a reection in complex directions (y1, y2). this is also
realized in the t-dual version of zz3 with 3 and 7d-branes where we have the element
(1)f r1r2r3, with ri a reection in yi plane. in such a case we could place an iso-
lated antibrane at a zz2 xed point, which is not a zz3 xed orbifold point. orbifold
invariance requires other two antibranes at each of the zz3 images. this antibrane
triplet is trapped since it would need a r mirror to leave the orientifold point as dy-

namical antibrane. hence, this triplet is a non supersymmetric, bounded conguration,

of three antibranes which is stable. building up a full consistent stable non supersym-

metric orientifold model will require that branes are also stuck, otherwise they will be

attracted to the antibranes and annihilate. in fact, this appears to be the case for zz6
orientifold. in section 4.3 we provide a zz3 example with 3-branes and 3-antibranes.
in principle, the above construction could be extended to other orbifold actions like
zz3  zz3, zz7 etc.

3 type i zz3 vacua with wilson lines

the introduction of wilson lines [34] in heterotic orbifold [31] models enormously

increased the possible consistent chiral string vacua and allowed for the rst explicit

construction of quasi-realistic string models in the past decade [35], including standard-

like models with three families of quarks and leptons. the most interesting models,

from the phenomenological point of view, happened to be those built from the zz3

2in the presence of discrete wilson lines on 9-branes the dierent xed points feel dierent gauge

embeddings. in this case some of the xed points may not require the presence of 5-branes or anti-5-

branes, as we describe below.

9

orbifold. one of the reasons for this is that three generations come out very naturally

in this construction.

in this section, following [11], we will introduce the eects of wilson lines on the

zz3 type iib orientifolds including branes and anti-branes as in ref.
[29]. the zz3
orientifold without wilson lines was already presented in [29] . we will see that wil-

son lines substantially increases the versatility of the models, allowing to break the

gauge groups in the 9-brane sector and also the possibility to modulate and reduce

substantially the matter content from the 5-brane sectors.

adding one single wilson line will give us enough freedom to construct phenomeno-

logically interesting three generation models, and the spectrum is simple enough that

we can discuss the most general case explicitly.

3.1 spectrum of the models

let us consider the twist matrix 1,9 = (1,9, 
a wilson line w = ( w, w 
the most general explicit form for such matrices can be written as

1,9) as given in 2.2. we can also include
1 ) wrapping along direction e1 in the rst complex plane.

9 = diag (in0, in1, in2, in3, in4)
w = diag (in0, in1, in2, in3, 2in4)

with  = e2i/3.

the associated shifts are

where, as usual, the power on each of the entries actually means the number of times

that number appears in the vector. so each vector has dimension n0 + n1 + n2 + n3 +
n4 = 16. hence the 99 sector gauge group is

r-r tadpole cancellation requires

(3.5)

(3.6)

for k = 0, 1, 2. also the total number of branes and antibranes must be the same.

10

in the rst and second complex planes there are nine orbifold xed points which

we label as (a, i), a, i = 0, 1, 2. we can put several 5-branes or anti 5-branes at

0 + 2qj

can choose to sit 2ni
0 j 6= i anti 5-branes at the xed
points set l0 = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)}, which do not feel the action of w. here the
indices i, j = 0, 1, 2 label each of the three xed points, and the requirement i 6= j
states that we do not put branes and anti-branes at the same point. similarly, to the
xed points l1 = {(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)} feeling v + w we assign 2ni
1 5-branes and
2pj
1 anti 5-branes. finally at l2 = {(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)} feeling v  w we assign
2 5-branes and 2pj
2ni
2 anti 5-branes. we will also consider the possibility

1 + 2qj
2 + 2mi

2 + 2qj

1 + 2mi

of having 2r extra anti 5-branes not attached to any of the xed points.

therefore at the ith xed point in the set la, a = 0, 1, 2 we have:

5,i,a = diag (i2mi

following the method of the previous section we can compute the fermionic spectrum,

which is supersymmetric on the branes and non-supersymmetric on the anti-branes.

first, the 99 sector is independent of the brane/anti-brane distribution, and it is quite

analogous to what one nds in computing the untwisted sector of heterotic orbifold

models. in particular, for the zz3 orbifold, it comes in three identical copies, associated
to each of the three complex planes. this is the origin of the three families in most of
our models 3

fermions+ :

3 [(2n0, n2) + (n1, n3) + (n1, n4) + (n3, n4) + a2]

where we write in parentheses pairs of fundamentals of the corresponding u(ns) groups
and a2 is the (conjugate) antisymmetric representation of u(n2). the 59 sectors
depend on which shift vector is felt by the corresponding xed points. then, for the
set l0, the eective shift for the 59 sector is simply v9  (0mi

0). we then nd

for the xed points on the set l1, the eective shift is now (v9 + w9)  (0mi

the massless fermions fall into the following representations:

similarly for the l2 set, the eective shift is (v9w9)(0mi

to nish the supersymmetric part of the spectrum, we should write down the 55

sectors. as explained in the previous section we use here the shift vectors dened from

the 5 matrices and obtain:

in an analogous way we can also compute the nonsupersymmetric massless spec-

the chirality is opposite from that of the supersymmetric sector, and then the spec-
a and mi
trum comes from considering the eective shifts with qj

respectively. for instance, for the 59 sector, the eective shift is v9  (0pi

is actually reducible to a r(2r  1)  1 dimensional representation plus a singlet.

in the spectrum above we have not indicated the corresponding u(1) charges. the

convention is that a fundamental of u(n), n carries charge 1 (no normalized ) with
respect to u(1) in u(n) while n has charge 1. thus, for instance, (n3, ni
2) carries
charge 1 with respect to u(1) in u(n3), and 1 with respect to the u(1) groups in
u(ni
has charge 2.

it is straightforward to check that all non-abelian gauge anomalies cancel if tadpole

representation carries charge 2 while

conditions 3.10 are satised. for this we have to keep in mind that branes and anti
branes do not coexist at a given point so, for instance, if for a given i, we have ni
a 6= 0
4in the presence of certain discrete wilson lines there are no massless particles in the 59 sectors

and hence the 55 states act as sort of hidden sectors for the 99 particles. see the discussion at the

beginning of section 4.1.

this implies that qi

a = 0. also see that multiplicities coming from 95la sectors appear

with a negative sign since fermions carry opposite chirality.

from this general expressions we can consider special cases which simplify substan-

tially the spectrum. for instance in some models the tadpoles cancel for one or more of

the sets la, so there is no need of introducing 5-branes and antibranes at those points.
in those cases the coecients mi
a will vanish and also their corresponding
gauge groups and matter content. a particularly interesting case is when we set all the

a, ni

a, pj

a, qj

antibranes in the bulk, so that only 5-branes are trapped at some of the xed points
(r = 2 pi,a(ni
a)). we will see explicit examples of these cases in the following
sections.

3.2 anomalous u (1) cancellation and fi-terms

knowing the general spectrum we can see that there are several u(1) symmetries. as

usual in string theory some of these symmetries are anomalous but the anomaly is

cancelled by the standard green-schwarz mechanism. unlike the heterotic models,

type i models have the peculiarity of having several twisted ramond-ramond elds

which can participate in the anomaly cancelling mechanism, therefore allowing for the

existence of several anomalous u(1)s. in the heterotic case only one u(1) symmetry

could be anomalous since there is only one antisymmetric tensor eld to cancel it.

for example in a model with only 9-branes the coupling of the u(1) elds to the
antisymmetric ramond-ramond eld in the k-th twisted sector b
k
[30]:

is proportional to

itr (ki)bk  fu (1) = (2ni sin 2kvi) bk  fu (1)

(3.12)

where ni is the rank of the ith u(n) group and vi is the component of the corresponding
shift vector overlapping with that u(n). furthermore, supersymmetry implies that the

anomaly cancellation term induces a fayet-iliopoulos term of the form:

 di x

f

ni sin 2kvi mf

(3.13)

where the sum runs over the xed points. mf is the neveu-schwarz partner of the
ramond-ramond antisymmetric tensor eld (which together form a supersymmetric

linear multiplet in four dimensions, usually dualized to a standard chiral multiplet).

the net eect of the anomaly cancelling and fayet iliopoulos terms is to give a mass
[30, 36, 37, 38] to the anomalous gauge eld and the multiplet containing mf and b
f .
contrary to heterotic models, in type i models the anomalous u(1)s can survive at

15

low energies as global symmetries, which could have interesting phenomenologically

implications [39].

let us then identify which of the many u(1) symmetries of our models are anoma-

lous. for deniteness we will concentrate explicitly on the models with only trapped

branes (anti-branes on the bulk). first of all we notice that each of the u(1)s is in-

side a u(n) symmetry. there are four of them coming from the 9-brane sector groups
u(ns), s = 1,   , 4 and a maximum of 9 coming from the 5-branes groups u(ni
a). we

need to compute the mixed u(1)  su(ns)2, u(1)  so(2n0)2, u(1)  su(ni

u(1)  sp(mi
4+9 u(1)s and 23 columns corresponding to the nonabelian groups su(ns), so(2n0),
su(ni
ij where the super-indices ,  = 9, 5 only
label the brane origin of the groups. the matrix indices i, j label the anomaly of the

a) and sp(2mi

a) and sp(mi

ith u(1) group with the jth nonabelian group gj . looking at the spectrum we can
simplify the writing of the matrix since for a given xed point sector la the corre-
sponding u(ni
a), i = 0, 1, 2, are essentially the same. the anomaly matrix
is then an array with the rst 4 rows giving the anomalies for the u(1)s of the 9-brane
sector and the last three for the ni
2. the 11 columns would then correspond to:
the rst 4 to su(ns), the 5th to so(2n0), th next three to su(ni
a), a = 0, 1, 2 and the
last three to sp(2mi

where the dependence on the ranks of the dierent u(n) groups reects the fact that

the u(1)s are not normalized. one can check that in the more general case there are up

to 9 anomalous u(1)s and 4 non-anomalous u(1)s. the 4 anomaly free combinations

have the following general form:

where, to simplify the expressions, we have absorbed the rank in the denition of the
charges (qn1/n1  qn1 and so on). qa comes completely from the 9-brane sector
and it will be eventually identied with hypercharge in the standard-like models of

next sections. the 9 anomalous u(1)s are then:

(3.18)

the presence of at most 9 anomalous u(1)s is expected because there are only 9 xed

points in the rst two complex planes, and hence there are 9 rr twisted elds which

can participate in the generalized green-schwarz mechanism. the anomalous u(1)s

will become massive by using the 9 rr twisted eld combinations as their longitudinal

components so that they become massive vector supermultiplets. as discussed above,

fayet-iliopoulos terms depending on the twisted ns elds do also appear. let us write

the above 9 anomalous u(1) generators in the general formula

where the m(a,i), a, i = 0, 1, 2 are the twisted ns elds associated to the rst two com-
plex planes. the above are nine linear independent combinations of the nine twisted

moduli. in the eective scalar potential there will be terms coming from the d-terms

of the anomalous u(1)s which will have the general qualitative structure

vr =

2

(x

l

l |l|2 + r)2
qr

(3.21)

where l denote scalar elds with charge qr
l under u(1)r. notice that putting all charged
elds to zero and also the twisted modes (r = 0) is perfectly consistent. thus unlike

what happens in perturbative heterotic vacua [41] the fi-terms do not necessarily

trigger further gauge symmetry breaking and the anomalous u(1)s may remain as

global symmetries at low energies. on the other hand one can also obtain vr = 0 for
congurations with some non-vanishing vev for some l elds by compensating it by
appropriately choosing the r values. thus in the specic examples of section 4 we

will see how in the (55) sectors there are singlet scalars charged under the anomalous

u(1)s. they can be given non-vanishing vevs as long as we also give appropriate vevs

to some particular combinations of twisted ns elds.

let us come back now to the issue of u(1) anomaly cancellation. the anomaly

cancelling coecients have been worked out for the general class of zzn orientifold
models and found to take the form [30].

v9, v9 + w9 or v9  w9, along the entries overlapping with the corresponding group.
notice that since wilson lines are included, a sum over contributions from dierent

dierent shift vector. finally

here va = a/n, a = 1, 2, 3 specify the orbifold twist on each of the complex planes,
as introduced in the previous section. the same expressions are valid for antibrane-

antibrane sectors but an extra minus sign must be included because of opposite chi-
rality. for the zz3 case under consideration we have c 

1 = c 

2 = 33 and

cal and we nd:

(3.24)

therefore anomalies are exactly cancelled as expected. similarly we can compute the

mixed u(1) anomalies which are also cancelled by the green-schwarz mechanism.

mixed u(1)-gravitational anomalies can also be computed. we obtain from the triangle
diagrams: (0,9n2, 0, 0,3ni

where again the vi is the relevant component of each of the three dierent shifts.
this cancellation can be considered as a nontrivial consistency check for the whole

construction.

4 examples of three-generation models

as we discussed in the previous section, untwisted tadpole conditions require the same

number of 5-branes and anti-5-branes in the vacuum. we will consider two general

type of models in turn:
i) models with only 5-branes stuck at xed points and ii)
models with both 5-branes and anti-5-branes present at xed points 5. the rst class

of models lead generically to gravity mediation of susy-breaking. in this case the

natural value for the string scale is the intermediate scale. the second class of models

are explicitly non-supersymmetric. this requires lowering the string scale further, as

we discuss in section 5. we will describe these two types in turn.

a, mi

using the general formalism of section 3, it is straightforward to look for values for
ns and ni
a that give standard-like models. the groups will generically be much
larger than su(3)  su(2)  u(1), but we can look for models for which some of the
gauge sectors are hidden, in the sense that they do not have direct non-abelian couplings

with the standard model elds. it turns out to be dicult to accommodate the group

of the sm and the necessary left-handed quarks inside a (55) sector and hence we will

embed the full standard model group inside the 9-branes sector. we would not get

5there is a third logical possibility in which only anti-5-branes are stuck at the xed points and

5-branes live in the bulk. in this case one obtains non-supersymmetric models which are very similar

in their characteristics to the type ii) above. thus we will not consider this option in the remainder

of this paper.

19

the right spectrum from so(2n0) su(n2) part neither, therefore we are limited to a
subgroup of u(n1) u(n3) u(n4). furthermore, it is easy to see that the spectrum
is invariant under permutations of n1, n3 and n4, so without loss of generality we can
identify say n3 = 3, n4 = 2, n1 = 1 to give us the su(3)  su(2)  u(1) respectively
(we may have to redene fundamental and anti-fundamental representations in some

cases). plugging these values into the tadpole cancellation conditions we nd that n2
and ni

a have to satisfy:

this corresponds to two 5-branes at three xed points (l0) and four 5-branes at

could also choose a more complicated conguration such as qj

pairs in the vacuum to be dynamically preferred with respect to those with large numbers since they

contribute to the vacuum energy in a way proportional to their tension.

detail and leave the other two for the appendix. the three of them are summarized in

the tables below.

another important issue is the way hypercharge is embedded into the gauge group

of the models. hypercharge will be identied with one of the anomaly-free u(1)s in
eq.(3.16) . the simplest such embedding correspond to (b1, b2, b3, b4) = (1, 0, 1,1)
which indeed gives the appropriate hypercharge of the left-handed quarks which reside

in the (99) sectors of these models.

in this case one sees from eqs.(3.16) that the

hypercharge generator is purely embedded into the (99) sector without any mixing

from (55) sectors.

one can in principle try to identify the hypercharge generator with other combina-

tions which also give the correct hypercharge of left-handed quarks, like (b1, b2, b3, b4) =
(1, 0,2, 1). in this case eqs.(3.16) show that the hypercharge generator will mix with
the u(1)s coming from 5-branes. this means in particular that the elds in the (55)

sector will have (fractional) electric charges. the same will be true in models with

n1 = 0. in those models the (99) sector will only contain the left-handed quarks and
the u(1) generator giving correctly its hypercharge will necessarily mix with u(1)s

coming from 5-branes. in fact, elds coming from the (55) sectors will in general get

vacuum expectation values as soon as the blowing-up modes are not strictly zero (see

eq.(3.21). then only the hypercharge fully embedded in the (99) sector remains unbro-

ken and the other possibilities are not really viable since the corresponding generators

are broken. thus we will identify the physical hypercharge generator with qa in (3.16).
a similar analysis can be done if we want a left-right symmetric model su(3)c 
su(2)l  su(2)r, for which we want n3 = 3, n1 = n4 = 2. in this case, there are
two simple options: n2 = 7, n0 = 2 which in order to satisfy the tadpole equations
require at least ni
2 = 1 which means two 5-branes trapped at each of the three xed
points in l2. this is probably the simplest model and we will discuss it in detail next.
the second option requires n2 = 8, n0 = 1 which is a bit more complicated since it
requires at least ni
1 = 1, which means four 5-branes at each of the six
points in l0, l1, or substituting them by anti 5-branes in the three points in l1 and
one of the points in l0. we will not discuss this model in detail, but only present its
spectrum in the tables.

0 = mi

0 = ni

1 = mi

if we want to have larger symmetry groups, we may consider a su(4)  su(2)l 
su(2)r model of the pati-salam type. for this we then choose n3 = 4, n1 = n4 = 2.
again there are two simple solutions. one with n2 = 6, n0 = 2 requires only ni
2 = 2
which is four 5-branes at each of the three xed points l2. we will discuss this model

21

and its realization in terms of trapped branes and anti branes in the next subsection.
the second option n2 = 8, n0 = 0 is also very simple, requiring only mi
0 = 1
which is two 5-branes at each of the six xed points l0 and l1. the spectrum can
be seen in the tables below. we will write the full massless spectrum in the tables.

1 = mi

symmetries even larger than pati-salam, like a standard gut group (see the example

in the appendices) or ipped su(5) do not seem to have interesting matter content in

this class of models.

we will discuss next in some detail several standard-like models, rst the class

with only branes trapped at the xed points (gravity mediated) and then the one with

both branes and anti-branes trapped at the xed points with explicit supersymmetry
breaking. we summarize the spectrum of the three su(3)  su(2)  u(1) models,
the two su(3)  su(2)l  su(2)r models and the two pati-salam models mentioned
above in two tables, one for each class.

4.1 models with only branes stuck at xed points

in order to cancel twisted tadpoles it is enough to add 5-branes appropriately to the

xed points in the rst two complex planes of the underlying zz3 orbifold. the anti-
in
5-branes will be located generically in the bulk of the rst two complex planes.

addition one can always add an appropriate wilson line in the third complex plane

and acting only on anti-5-branes in such a way that they are decoupled both from
9-branes and 5-branes 7. in this way the anti-5-brane sector (which is the only one

which is not supersymmetric) behaves like a sort of hidden sector for the observable

sector of 9, 5-branes which is supersymmetric. supersymmetry-breaking eects in this

visible sector will be suppressed by the compactication radii providing an example of

gravity mediated susy-breaking. as we already mentioned one could worry about the

presence of attractive forces between branes and antibranes which might render this

type of conguration unstable. we postpone the discussion of these eects to chapter

5 and we limit ourselves to the construction of these models (otherwise tachyon-free

and free of rr tadpoles).

i) a three generation standard model

7this procedure is more transparent if we perform a t-duality transformation in the third complex

plane in such a way that 9-branes turn into 7-branes localized at the origin in the third complex plane.

the anti-5-branes turn into anti-3-branes. the latter decouple from 7-branes if we locate them away

from the origin.

22

let us consider the zz3 orientifold with an action of the twist on the chan-paton
factors given by n0 = 2, n1 = 1, n2 = 8, n3 = 3, n4 = 2 as mentioned above. we
choose to reorder the twist and wilson lines in order that the standard model sector

can be clearly distinguished, so we will write:

v9 = 1/3(1, 1, 1,1,1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
a quantized wilson line is added in the rst complex plane given by:

w9 = 1/3(1, 1, 1, 1, 1,1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

(4.2)

(4.3)

the gauge group from the (99) sector will be u(3)u(2)u(1)[so(4)u(8)]. now,
the 9 zz3 xed points in the rst two complex planes split into three sets of three xed
points each : (0, m), (1, m) and (1, m) with m = 0,1. the shifts corresponding to
each of these three sets are v , v + w and v  w respectively. the corresponding
value for tr ,9 are -7, -4 and -1 respectively. looking at the tadpole cancellation
conditions we see that we will be forced to add 5-branes at the xed points (0, m) with
tr ,5 = +1 and also at the xed points (1, m) with tr ,5 = 1. no 5-branes have
to be added to the points (1, m) since tadpoles cancel without them. thus the simplest

option is to locate 5-branes with twist actions given by:

(0, m)  ,5 = diag (i2, , 2)
(1, m)  ,5 = diag (, 2)

(4.4)

notice that these 5-branes are stuck at the xed points, they cannot leave the xed

points without violating the twisted tadpole conditions. let us then compute the

massless spectrum. after an analysis of the u(1)s in the model one can check that
the generator given by 8 :

y = (1/3,1/3.  1/3,1/2,1/2, 1, 0, .., 0)

(4.5)

is anomaly free and can be identied with standard weak hypercharge. one nds the

following chiral charged elds from each sector:

(99):

8notice that this denition corresponds to the qa generator of eq.(3.16) once one takes into account

the ip in sign in the twist vectors v and w for the u (2) and u (1) groups compared to the conventions

of chapter 3.

23

there are chiral multiplets transforming under the gauge group like 9 :

3(3, 2, 1/6) + 3(3, 1,2/3) + 3(1, 2, +1/2) + [3(1, 28) + 3(4, 8)]

(4.6)

these elds correspond to 3 generations of left-handed quarks and right-handed u-

quarks as well as three sets of higgs elds hu .

(59) :
from the 5-branes at the (1, m) xed points we get a u(1)3

5 gauge group. one

then nds chiral multiplets (in three copies, one per xed point) transforming like:

(1, 2,1/2)q + (1, 1, +1)q + (3, 1,1/3)q + (3, 1, 1/3)q + [(1, 8)
where the subindex q refers to the u(1)3

5 charges. these elds include three standard
lepton generations and three sets of vector-like quarks. the su(2) doublets could also

q + (4, 1)

q] (4.7)

be hd type of higgsses which have same quantum numbers as left-handed leptons.

from the 5-branes at the (0, m) xed points we get a (sp(2) u(1))3 gauge group.
one then nds chiral multiplets (in three copies, one per xed point) transforming like:

(1, 2,1/2; 2) + (1, 2, 1/2; 1)r + (3, 1, 1/3; 2) + (3, 1,1/3; 1)r +
(1, 1, +1; 1)r + (1, 1,1; 1)r + [(1, 8; 2) + (1, 8)

r + (4, 1)

r]

(4.8)

where the subindex r refers to the u(1)3

5 charges. the doublets after the semicolons
refer to the sp(2) groups. these chiral multiplets include a net number of three right-

handed d-quarks and three left-handed leptons (or hd doublets). in addition there
are three pairs of vector-like right-handed d-quarks and leptons.

(55) :
for those 5-branes sitting at xed points (1, m) there is just one singlet chiral
eld (1)2q associated to the third complex plane. for those 5-branes sitting at xed
points (0, m) there are multiplets transforming under sp(2)  u(1) like:

3(2)r + (1)2r

(4.9)

altogether this model has three standard model quark lepton generations and in

addition 6 copies of higgs-like elds (hu + hd) plus 6 vector-like sets of d-quarks and
three vector-like sets of right-handed electrons. vacuum expectation values of singlets

9properly speaking, using the general formulae of chapter 3 we would have obtained the conjugate

states to the ones we display in this chapter 4. we have preferred to list the conjugates so that one

recovers the usual conventions of the sm in which it is left-handed quarks which are colour triplets

(and not antitriplets).

24

in (55) sector can give masses to many of these extra particles. in particular, as we
will mention below, in the (55) sector of 5-branes on the xed points (1, m) there are
singlets which couple to the extra triplets in that (95) sector. if those singlets get a

vev (which may happen in a d-term at manner if we turn on a vacuum expectation

value to the relevant blowing-up elds) those triplets get heavy. the same happens

with the extra right-handed leptons in the (59) sectors corresponding to xed points

(0, m). we would be thus left with 3 standard quark-lepton generations plus 6 sets of

extra vector-like left-handed leptons and 3 sets of vector-like dr quarks. we will see in
chapter 5 that in that case gauge coupling unication takes place at the intermediate

scale precisely due to the presence of these extra elds.

let us nally mention a few aspects with regard to the u(1)s in this model. using

the results of chapter 3 it is easy to check that there are 7 anomalous u(1)s (which

then will become massive as usual). there remain 3 anomaly-free u(1)s, one of which

is the hypercharge dened above. the other two anomaly-free u(1)s, which involve a

mixture with 5-brane u(1)s, will also be spontaneously broken if the singlets in (55)

sectors get vevs, as mentioned above. thus, generically only the standard hypercharge

will remain unbroken at low energies.

ii) a three generation su(3)  su(2)l  su(2)r  u(1) model
let us consider now the zz3 orientifold with twist action on cp factors given by
n0 = 2, n1 = n4 = 2, n2 = 7, n3 = 3, again as in the previous example we choose
to write explicitly the twist and wilson lines such that the l  r model sector looks
more transparent:

v9 = 1/3(1, 1, 1,1,1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
a quantized wilson line is added in the rst complex plane given by:

(4.10)

w9 = 1/3(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

(4.11)

the gauge group from the (99) sector will be u(3)u(2)u(2)u(1)[so(4)u(7)].
now the nine xed points in the rst two complex planes split again into the same
three sets (0, m), (1, m) and (1, m) which have associated twists v , v + w and
v  w respectively. the corresponding value for tr ,9 are -4, -4 and -1. this means
that we will only need to add 5-branes at the points (1, m) verifying tr ,5 = 1.
the simplest option verifying this is adding two 5-branes at each xed point with
,5 = diag(, 2). again the 5-branes are trapped by tadpole conditions.

25

let us now compute the spectrum which in this model is particularly simple. one

can check that the u(1) generator dened by:

qbl = (2/3,2/3,2/3,1,1,1,1, 0, 0, ..., 0)

(4.12)

is anomaly free and can be identied with the standard b  l symmetry of left-
right symmetric models. one nds chiral multiplets transforming under the su(3) 
su(2)l  su(2)r  u(1)bl group:

(99):

3(3, 2, 1, 1/3) + 3(3, 1, 2,1/3) + 3(1, 2, 2, 0) + [3(1, 21) + 3(4, 7)]

(4.13)

these elds include three standard quark generations plus three sets of higgs elds.

(59) :
from the 5-branes at the (1, m) xed points we get a u(1)3

5 gauge group. one

then nds chiral multiplets (in three copies, one per xed point) transforming like:

(1, 2, 1, +1)q + (1, 1, 2,1)q + (3, 1, 1,2/3)q + (3, 1, 1, 2/3)q + [(1, 7)

q]
(4.14)
5. these multiplets include three
standard generations of leptons and in addition three vectorlike sets of color triplets.

the subindex q indicates the charge under the u(1)3

q + (4, 1)

(55) :
for those 5-branes sitting at xed points (1, m) there is just one singlet chiral

eld (1)2q associated to the third complex plane.

the massless spectrum of this model is remarkably simple. notice that, like in the

previous model the extra colored objects may get massive if the singlets in the (55)

sectors get a vev. then the massless spectrum contains just three standard generations

and three sets of higgs elds.

iii) a three generation su(4)  su(2)  su(2) model.
following similar lines we can consider the following twist action on cp factors and

quantized wilson line in the rst complex plane for the zz3 orbifold (n0 = 2, n1 =
n4 = 2, n2 = 6, n3 = 4):

v9 = 1/3 (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

(4.15)

w9 = 1/3 (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

26

the gauge group in the 99 sector is u(4)  u(2)  u(2)  so(4)  u(6). the sectors
feeling the action of v and v + w do not need the addition of 5-branes (nor anti
5-branes) since the corresponding value for tr ,9 = 4 cancels the tadpoles. on the
other hand the sector feeling v  w has tr ,9 = 2 and we need to add appropriate
combinations of 5-branes and anti 5-branes in order to satisfy tadpole cancellation. a
conguration of four 5-branes stuck at each of the three xed points (1, m) precisely
satisfy the tadpole constraint. in this case ,5 = diag(, , 2, 2) implying a 5-brane
gauge group u(2) on each of the three xed points. we can identify the rst factors
of the 9-brane gauge groups as in the pati-salam model: su(4)c  su(2)l  su(2)r.
the other factors may be considered as hidden sectors. the spectrum comes again

naturally in three families, in a self-explanatory notation:

(99):

3 [(4, 2, 1) + (4, 1, 2) + (1, 2, 2)] + 3 [(4, 6) + (1, 15)]

(4.16)

the observable part includes the complete three families of quarks and leptons, as in
the standard pati-salam model, plus three copies of su(2)l  su(2)r higgs elds.

(59):

since we have three identical copies of u(2) on each of the three xed points, we

will get three copies of:

[(4, 1, 1; 2)q + (4, 1, 1; 2)q + (1, 2, 1; 2)q + (1, 1, 2; 2)q] + [(4, 1; 2)

q + (1, 6; 2)
q]
(4.17)

where the last entry on each particle represents its transformation property under the

corresponding su(2) and the subindices the charge with respect to the u(1). notice

that again we have vector-like colored elds in this sector plus three extra doublets
of su(2)l  su(2)r. however, with the usual embedding of hypercharge into the
pati-salam model their charges are not standard.

(55):

in this sector we only get a triplet plus two singlets under each of the three u(2)
factors coming from the 5-branes. the triplet may couple to the vector-like 4 + 4 of
the 59 sector to make them massive. also most of the u(1) factors are anomalous,

their anomaly is cancelled by the green-schwarz mechanism and they do not appear

as low-energy gauge elds, only probably as remnant global symmetries, as usual in

these class of models. there is one nonanomalous u(1) surviving at low-energy. it is

q = 1/2 (1, 1, 1, 1,2,2, 2, 2, 0,   , 0)

(4.18)

27

all other groups would decouple from the observable sector, leading to a very sim-

ple string version of the pati-salam model. as in the previous models, we will need

an equal number (12) of anti 5-branes in the bulk to cancel the tadpoles, breaking

supersymmetry in a truly hidden sector.

4.2 models with both branes and antibranes stuck at xed

points

one can also construct models in which both branes and antibranes are both stuck

at (dierent) xed points. this possibility has the attractive feature that provides an

explanation to the absence of (partial) brane-antibrane annihilation without the need

to resort to other dynamical arguments. on the other hand these models are in general

non-supersymmetric already at the level of the massless spectrum. there might be in

general transitions between the previous type models and the present ones as we will

discuss below. in fact we are going to build the models now by simply replacing some

of the 5-branes by anti-5-branes in the previous models in such a way that the net total

number of 5-branes charge is zero.

i) a non-susy three generation standard model

here on the same model of the previous section we can add a dierent conguration

of branes and anti-branes. the (99) sector will be identical and we will still add two
5-branes at each of the three xed points (1, m) with ,5 = (, 2). thus, at those
xed points we will have three copies of fermions and complex scalars transforming like

(59) :

(1, 2,1/2)q + (1, 1, +1)q + (3, 1,1/3)q +(3, 1, 1/3)q + [(1, 8)
where the subindex q correspond to the u(1)5 charges. we thus have here three sets of
right-handed leptons and three sets of left-handed leptons (or hd higgs superelds).
from the (55) sector one gets one singlet supereld 12q which has couplings to the
vectorlike quarks above. thus the latter may become massive eventually if this singlet

q + (4, 1)

q] (4.19)

gets a vev.

now we will put two anti-5-branes at each of the three xed points (0, m) with
,5 = (, 2) in such a way that tadpole conditions are fullled. there will be a
5 from the anti-5-branes. from (59) sectors one gets matter elds in three copies
u(1)3

transforming like:

28

(59) :

f ermions :

scalars :

(3, 1, 1/3)r + (1, 2,1/2)r + (1, 1, +1)r + (1, 1,1)r + [(1, 8)
(3, 1, 1/3)r + (1, 2,1/2)r + [8

r] + h.c.

r + (4, 1)

r]

(4.20)

where the subindex r refers to the u(1)3

5 charges. notice that now this sector con-
tains the three right-handed d-quarks and three left-handed leptons, as well as a
set of vector-like right-handed leptons. from the (55) sector one gets a couple of
fermions transforming like 12r and one singlet scalar 12r, as well as three extra sin-
glet fermions with negative chirality (the would be gauginos of each u(1) coming from

the antibranes). the scalar 12r has in general couplings with the vector-like pair of
right-handed leptons above which then may become massive eventually.

notice that the present model is explicitly non-supersymmetric since some of the

particles do not have susy-partners. on the other hand the number of 5-branes and

anti-5-branes is the same and are all stuck at the xed points. since there are only

u(1)s coming from 5 and anti-5-branes, there will be no gauge group left from those

since they are anomalous and will become all massive in the usual way. in this sense

this model is simpler than its counterpart in section 4.1. the u(1) symmetries will

remain however as eective global symmetries giving a avour structure to the model.

ii) a non-susy su(3)  su(2)  su(2)  u(1) model
again, on model ii) of previous section we distribute 5-branes and anti-5-branes in

a dierent manner. the (99) sector will be identical but now on two of the xed points
(e.g., (1, 0) and (1, 1) ) we will add two 5-branes with ,5 = (, 2) so that tadpoles
cancel. these subsectors will be supersymmetric and we will get supermultiplets in two

copies transforming like

(1, 2, 1, +1)q + (1, 1, 2,1)q + (3, 1, 1,2/3)q + (3, 1, 1, 2/3)q + [(1, 7)

q + (4, 1)

q]
(4.21)

where the subindices denote the u(1)5 charge. thus from these two xed points we get
two lepton generations (plus vector-like triplets which may become massive through
couplings to (55) singlets). now, on the remaining xed point (1,1) we will add 4
anti-5-branes with ,5 = (i2, , 2) so that tadpoles cancel. there will be a (sp(2) 
u(1)5)3 from the anti-5-branes. from (59) sectors one gets matter elds in one copy
transforming like:

(59) :

29

f ermions

scalars

(1, 2, 1, 1; 2) + (1, 2, 1,1, ; 1)r + (1, 1, 2,1; 2)

:
+ (1, 1, 2, 1, ; 1)r + (3, 1, 1, 1/3)r + (3, 1, 1,1/3)r
+ [(1, 7; 2) + (1, 7)

r + (4, 1)

r]

[(3, 1, 1, 1/3; 2) + (3, 1, 1,1/3; 2) + (4; 2)]

:
+ [(1, 2, 1,1, ; 1)r + (1, 1, 2, 1, ; 1)r + (7)

r + h.c.]

(4.22)

here we get a third chiral generation of leptons and an extra vector-like set of leptons.

again there are also vector-like triplets which may become massive through scalars in
the (55) sector. the latter has fermions transforming like 3(2)r + 2(1)2r and scalars
3(2)r + (1)2r which indeed couple to the above vector-like triplets. it also has one
triplet of fermions of the sp(2) group as well as an extra singlet, both with negative

chirality.

notice that the spectrum of this model is supersymmetric except for one of the

lepton generations. the number of 5-branes and anti-5-branes is the same and all are

stuck at the xed points.

iii) a non-susy su(4)  su(2)  su(2) model
here on the same model of the previous section we can add a dierent conguration

of branes and anti-branes. if we want all extra branes stuck at orbifold xed points,

the simplest way of distributing the branes and anti-branes is 4 branes on one point,
say (1, 0), and two anti 5-branes at each of the other two points feeling the v  w
twist, say (1, 1), (1,1) . in those two points we have tr ,5 = diag(1, 1) implying
a group usp(2) at each of the two xed points.

the spectrum of this model is as follows. the 99 sector is identical to the one of

the previous section, including the three complete families of quarks and leptons. the

59 and 55 sectors include only one copy of the one presented in the previous section.

instead of the two other copies we have now the anti 5-brane sectors which are not

supersymmetric.

(59) :
on each xed point we will have fermions (with opposite chirality to the ones in

the other sectors) transforming as:

[(1, 2, 1; 2) + (1, 1, 2; 2)] + [(1, 6; 2)]

(4.23)

where again the last entry on each is the transformation under the corresponding sp(2).

30

the corresponding scalars will belong to the following representations:

(4, 1, 1; 2) + (4, 1, 1; 2) + (4, 1; 2)

(4.24)

in two copies, one per xed point.

(55) :
here there are only two copies of a fermion triplet one for each sp(2).

notice that all non-abelian gauge anomalies cancel in a slightly dierent manner to
the model with only 5-branes stuck. also, the (59) sector couples directly nonsuper-
symmetric matter to particles charged under the observable gauge group, therefore

serving as direct mediators of supersymmetry breaking. this is the main dierence

between the two models which otherwise are very similar phenomenologically.

4.3 a gravity mediated model with stuck branes and

antibranes

the gravity mediated models discussed above have non-stuck anti-branes somewhere

in the bulk. these antibranes will in general be attracted by the branes stuck at xed

points and the conguration might be unstable. as we discuss in chapter 5, whether

this will be the case or not depends on the complete balance of forces of the vacuum

but anyway one would like to have some example of gravity mediated model in which

all branes and antibranes are stuck. we will provide an example of this type here.

the model we are going to discuss is a zz3 orientifold with just 3-branes and anti-
3-branes which is just a slight (non-supersymmetric) modication of a supersymmetric
model presented in [12]. the orientifold operation will be (1)f r1r2r3 which re-
quires the presence of a net number of 3-branes minus anti-3-branes equal to 32 to

cancel untwisted tadpoles. now, the model contains: a) one xed point (the origin)

which is also xed under the orientifold operation b) other 26 xed points under the

zz3 twist which are not xed under the zz2 orientifold projection and c) 63 points
which are xed under the orientifold operation but are not xed under the zz3 action.
at the origin, twisted tadpole conditions require tr ,3 = 4 whereas at the other 26
zz3 xed points one has tr ,3 = 0.

we can now locate 11 3-branes at the origin with ,3 = (1, i5, 2i5). the gauge
group there will be su(5)  u(1) and there will be chiral multiplets transforming like
3(10)2 + 3(5)1, i.e., three standard su(5) generations. notice that these 11 branes
are stuck because 3-branes can only leave the origin in groups of 6 branes and those

remaining at the origin still have to obey the tadpole conditions. now we are going to

31

add 21 + 3n 3-branes and 3n anti-3-branes in such a way that all of them are trapped

at some points. in order to do that we recall that there is a simple way to trap 3-branes

(or anti-3-branes) at some points. indeed one can locate one 3-brane at one of the 63
xed points under (1)f r1r2r3. in order for this conguration to be invariant also
under zz3 we need to add one 3-brane at each of the two images of that point under
zz3. now, these three 3-branes are stuck at those orientifold points because they can
only travel in groups of 6 in the bulk. so we can locate the 21 + 3n 3-branes in some of

the 63 orientifold points available. in the same way we can locate the 3n anti-3-branes

at some other orientifold points. now all branes and anti-branes in the model will be

stuck and all tadpole conditions are met. the observable su(5) sector will only feel

the presence of the susy-breaking anti-3-branes from closed string exchange and the

eective eld theory will be that of a gravity mediated model.

notice that one can stuck anti-3-branes at orientifold xed points also in the class
of zz3 models with 7-branes and 3(3) pairs mentioned above. indeed, in this case the
orientifold operation is (1)f r3 and we can locate three anti-3-branes at the three
points with coordinates (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2) and (1/2, 1/2) in the 5-th and 6-th dimensions.

however we can only trap up to three anti-3-branes in this way whereas we would need

a minimum of 6 in the provided examples. one could perhaps nd this kind of models

in a search more systematic than the one we have made. the example provided in this

section is an existence proof of gravity mediated models with all branes and anti-branes

stuck.

5 scales and dynamics of the vacua

5.1 lowering the string scale

the type i vacua in previous sections are non-supersymmetric. the scale of susy-

breaking is thus essentially the string scale mstring. in the second class of models in
which some quark-lepton sectors are non-susy already at the level of the spectrum,
it is clear then that the string scale cannot be much higher than say ms  1  100
tev, otherwise all scalars will get masses in loops and we will have to face the usual

gauge hierarchy problem. in the rst class of models with anti-5-branes in the bulk

and hidden from 9-branes, susy-breaking is hidden from the observable world coming

from (99) and (59) sectors. thus susy-breaking will be only felt in a suppressed

manner and one would guess that there may appear susy-partner masses msb of
order msb = m 2
string/(mp lanck) as usual in hidden sector models. thus, if we want
msb not to exceed the weak scale mw so that the solution to the hierarchy problem
is not spoiled we must require:

mstring  qmw mp lanck  1011 gev

(5.1)

thus in any of the schemes here considered we need to lower the string scale well below

the planck mass, at least down to the intermediate scale.

it is by now well known that one can lower the string scale in generic type i vacua

[3, 4, 5]. in the zz3 case at hand it is more appropriate to perform a t-duality trans-
formation along the third compact complex plane and work with 7-branes instead of

9-branes and 3-, anti-3-branes instead of 5-, anti-5-branes. the orientifold operation
will be now (1)f r3, where r3 is the reection operation with respect to the third
complex plane. the world-volume of the 7-branes includes the rst two complex di-

mensions and they are located at the origin x3 = 0 in the third complex plane. as
in the case of 9-branes, one can add wilson-lines in the rst two complex planes and

one can distribute 3-branes or anti-3-branes located anywhere in compact space. the
distribution of 3(3)-branes and additions of wilson lines in the rst two complex planes
is subject to the tadpole constraints:

tr (w)k,7 + 3(tr ,3,l  tr ,3,l) = 4

(5.2)

where l labels the 9 xed points in the rst two complex planes. thus the model so

obtained has exactly the same massless spectrum and interactions as the original one.
now, if we locate the anti-3-branes at points with x3 6= 0, they will have no overlap

35

with the 7-branes and they will act as a susy-breaking hidden sector for the (77) and

(73) massless elds. this is the t-dual of the class of models considered in section 4.1.

let us consider the gauge couplings and scales in this class of orientifolds. the

planck mass mp is related to the compact scales mi, i = 1, 2, 3 and 10-dimensional
type i dilaton  by (see e.g. ref.[26]) :

mp =

22m 4
m1m2m3

s

and the gauge couplings of the gauge groups from 7-branes and 3-branes are

7 =

m 2

1 m 2
2

2m 4
s

; 3 =


2

thus, irrespective of the string scale one has:
2
7

mp =

m3

m1m2

.

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

by making m3 much smaller than m1,2  ms, one can obtain agreement with the
measured values of mp and 7.
in particular, one can set m1 = m2 = ms, which
leads to 7 = 3 = /2. one can now take the string scale at the intermediate scale
m1,2 = ms = 1010 gev by choosing m3  1 tev. in the same way, one can take
ms = m1,2 = 1 tev by taking m3 = 103 ev.

one concludes that the string scale, which in this case coincides with the susy-

breaking scale, may be arbitrarily lowered by making suciently large the third com-

pact dimension. notice that in the present scheme the rst two compact dimensions

are small, of order the string scale, whereas the third dimension is large. there may

be a possible dynamical explanation for this asymmetry in the second class of mod-

els discussed in the previous sections where branes and anti-branes are stuck at xed

points in the rst two complex compact dimensions. indeed, as emphasized in ref.[29]

, in this case one expects that the brane-anti-brane attraction will generate a potential

which will tend to shrink the compact radii r1,2. this force would not be present for
the third compact dimension which can then dynamically grow.

5.2 stability and eective potentials

another issue we need to address is the stability of these congurations. we know

that contrary to most previous considerations of brane/anti-brane systems, there are

no tachyons that could destabilize these constructions [29] . furthermore, some or all

of the branes must be trapped in the orbifold xed points in order to satisfy tadpole

36

cancellation. for instance, for the situation with only branes stuck at the xed points,

there will be the same number of anti-branes living on the bulk and one may wonder

why they do not approach the trapped branes and annihilate.

in fact the twisted

tadpole cancellation conditions in general forbid this complete annihilation process

because some residual branes or antibranes have to remain in the xed points to cancel

the tadpoles. thus the annihilation can only be partial.

in this connection it is interesting to study the possible relation between the models

of section 4.1 and those of section 4.2. one can imagine starting in a conguration with

branes stuck at the xed points and anti-branes moving freely on the bulk, like those of

section 4.1. eventually the right number of anti-branes would get attracted to the right

xed points, annihilating some of the branes at those points in a manner consistent
with tadpole cancellation. for instance in the su(3)  su(2)  su(2) model, we may
start with the conguration with three pairs of stuck 5-branes and six anti 5-branes

on the bulk. all of these anti 5-branes may go to one single xed point, annihilate

the two 5-branes there, leaving four anti 5-branes and becoming the corresponding
model of section 4.2. in the su(4)  su(2)  su(2) model however, the twelve anti
5-branes would have to go, six to one point and six to the second point in order to keep

tadpole cancellation. it is interesting to ask which brane conguration is dynamically

preferred, if any, since both seem to be connected in some way. this seems to be a

complicated dynamical question since several dynamical eects seem to be competing.

usually since branes and anti-branes carry opposite ramond-ramond charge they tend

to attract each other [29] . however, the presence of the stuck branes also induces a

repulsive interaction between them and the anti-branes, due to the total positive brane

tension, similar to the eect of a positive cosmological constant in inationary models,

for instance. this extra contribution to the vacuum energy corresponds actually to an

eective potential for the dilaton and the moduli elds. in general the exact form of

this potential is something beyond our control, since supersymmetry has been broken,

there are all sorts of radiative corrections that can contribute as well as standard non-
perturbative eects 10

in the case in which both branes and anti-branes are stuck at xed points (second

class of models in the previous sections) naively one could argue that there are com-

peting eects, some of them trying to shrink the rst two compact dimensions and

other trying to expand them, as we now explain. for the models constructed in terms

of 9 and 5-branes, the tension of the 5-branes and anti 5-branes is proportional to 1/,

10for some recent discussions of radii stabilisation in the context of brane models see refs.[42] .

37

with  the string coupling. upon compactication the tension will generate a term in
the action proportional to 1/m 2
3  where m3 is the compactication scale of the third
complex direction which the 5-brane is wrapped around. this is precisely the real

part of the so-called t3 eld of type i compactications. therefore we can see that
the brane tension induces a linear potential for one of the moduli elds. in the dual

version in terms of 7 and 3-branes, which is more appropriate to discuss a lowering of

the string scale, this term is only proportional to 1/ which is the corresponding dual

t3. recall that in the latter brane conguration, the moduli elds are given by the
following expressions [26]:

res =

ret1 =

2m 4
s

m 2

1 m 2
2
2m 4
s

m 2

2 m 2
3

; ret3 =

2


; ret2 =

2m 4
s

m 2

1 m 2
3

(5.6)

the gauge couplings are given by res for the groups on the 7-branes and ret3 for the
groups on the 3-branes. therefore perturbative corrections in the 7-branes eld theory
would go like sn whereas non-perturbative corrections would depend on es. there-

fore s seems to have the standard runaway behaviour towards large values whereas t3
has the linear contribution from the brane tension that tends to stabilize it at small
values. thus these two eects tend to drive m 2
res towards small values. on
the other hand there is in addition the contribution to the vacuum energy from the
brane/anti-brane attraction, that, as argued above, tends to drive m 2
3 to large val-
ues. thus there seems to be two competing eects in opposite directions. this could

3 = ret3

2 m 2

2 m 2

lead to two possible outcomes: i) the competing eects lead to stable minimum with

xed m1,2 and  or ii) at a given moment it could be more energetically favorable
that anti-branes pop out from the xed points to the bulk and only branes (satisfying

tadpole cancellations) remain there. this would mean a transition from the type of

models of section 4.2 to those of section 4.1. without more dynamical information it

is dicult to say which type of congurations, either with trapped anti-branes at xed

points or with antibranes away in the bulk is preferred from the eective potential

point of view.

all these considerations need further scrutiny in order to be able to extract concrete

implications about the eective dynamics of these new brane congurations. we have

the advantage over previous discussions that the models are explicit and the eective

action is in principle computable, at least in some approximation scheme. there is

no need to say that after xing the dilaton and moduli elds, we would have to be

exposed to the standard cosmological constant problem, as in any other treatment of

38

supersymmetry breaking.

5.3 yukawa couplings

this is not the place to make a detailed phenomenological analysis of yukawa cou-

plings which we leave to future work. it is however interesting to present the general

structure of yukawa couplings in this class of theories, which turn out to be quite dif-

ferent to similar heterotic orbifold models. the following renormalizable couplings are

generically present:

i) (99)(99)(99) couplings

there are superpotential couplings of the form :

99
i 99

j 99
k ,

i 6= j 6= k 6= i

(5.7)

where 99

i , i = 1, 2, 3 are charged chiral elds in the (99) sector associated to the com-
plex plane i. these type of couplings give rise for example to quark yukawa couplings
in the su(3)  su(2)l  su(2)r  u(1) models of chapter 4. these couplings are
totally analogous to the ones present for untwisted particles in perturbative heterotic
orbifolds. the couplings (55)3 have a completely analogous structure.

ii) (59)(99)(95) couplings

the worldvolume of 5-branes includes the third complex plane. thus there are

superpotential couplings of the form:

59
a 59

a 99
3

(5.8)

where a label the xed point where the 5-brane is localized. notice that only the (99)

chiral elds from the third complex plane have these couplings. in addition these cou-

plings are diagonal in the a label, i.e., there are no renormalizable couplings involving

dierent xed points. these type of couplings give rise for example to standard lepton
yukawa couplings in the su(3)  su(2)l  su(2)r  u(1) models of chapter 4.

iii) (55)(59)(95) couplings

in a similar manner there are superpotential couplings of the form

59
a 59

a 55
3,a

(5.9)

in which again a labels the xed point. only the (55) chiral elds in the third complex

plane appear in the coupling. for example, there is a coupling of this type between a
singlet (1)2q in the (55) sector and the coloured pair (3, 1, 1,2/3)q + (3, 1, 1, 2/3)q
in the same left-right symmetric model of chapter 4. in general the presence of this

39

type of couplings tends to reduce the number of extra vector-like elds in the massless

sector once scalars in the (55) sectors get vevs.

iv) (99)(59)(95) couplings
the (59) sectors are not supersymmetric so that some susy partners are missing.
again, only the (99) elds in the third complex plane have this type of couplings.

there are yukawa couplings of type:

59
a 59
59
a 59

a 99
3,a
a 99
3,a

(5.10)

in which now  denotes a scalar and  a fermion. examples of these are the lepton

yukawa couplings in the left-right symmetric model in section 4.2.

v) (55)(59)(95) couplings
in a similar manner there are yukawa couplings of the form

a 59
59
59
a 59

a 5
a 5

3,a

3,a

(5.11)

in which again a labels the xed point and () denotes a scalar(fermion). only the
(55) elds in the third complex plane appear in the coupling. for example, there is a
coupling of this type between a singlet scalar (1)2r in the (55) sector and the coloured
pair of fermions (3, 1, 1,2/3)r + (3, 1, 1, 2/3)r in the left-right symmetric model of
section 4.2.

as we mentioned above, the structure of the (55)3 couplings is analogous to that
of the (99)3 couplings. something similar happens for the couplings of type (55)3,
although, of course in this sector the spectrum is not supersymmetric. still the only

yukawa couplings which do not vanish are those involving elds in three dierent com-
plex planes. concerning the sizes of the couplings, (99)3, (59)(99)(95) and (99)(59)(95)
couplings are proportional to (res)1/2, s being the complex dilaton dened above.
(55)3, (55)3, (55)(59)(95) and (55)(59)(95) couplings are proportional to (t3)1/2 as
dened above.

it is interesting to remark that all models present a avour structure coming from

the dierent 5-brane groups. in the case in which 5 branes give only rise to u(1)s, we

have already seen how those u(1)s are broken by the green-schwarz mechanism and

eective global u(1)s eectively persist. these u(1) symmetries (and possibly larger

5-brane gauge symmetries) may play an important role in ensuring sucient proton

stability. we postpone a through analysis of this question for future work.

40

5.4 gauge coupling unication

an analysis of this question should be done on a model by model basis and such an

analysis goes beyond the scope of this paper. we would like to point out however

that in some of the models discussed above there is a tendency to get gauge coupling

unication at the intermediate scale. specically let us consider the sm orientifold of

section 4.1. notice rst that the embedding of the u(1) hypercharge does not have
the canonical normalization with g2
2 = 3/5 at the string scale. one rather has
1/g2
g2
2 = 3/11. then the one-loop renormalization group running from the string scale
ms to the weak scale mz gives for the weak angle and the qcd couplings at the weak
scale:

1/g2

sin2 w (mz) =

1

3(mz)

= 3

14(

3

6

14 (1 + 11(mz )
(mz )  1

1

(b2  3

11b1) log( ms
mz

) )

2 (b1 + b2  14

3 b3) log( ms
mz

) )

(5.12)

in order to perform the running we only have to include the particles which remain

massless below ms. in the particular models at hand that depends on whether certain
singlet elds in the (55) sectors get vevs and give masses to some vector-like particles.

we will consider the most generic case in which indeed those singlets get vevs of

order the string scale. let us assume then that, the three sets of chiral multiplets
(3, 1,1/3)q + (3, 1, 1/3)q and also the vector-like right-handed leptons from the
(0, m) xed points get a mass of order ms due to the couplings of these elds to the
singlet scalars in the (55) sectors. then below the string scale the -functions of the
su(3)  su(2)  u(1) interactions are respectively b3 = 0 , b2 = 6 and b1 = 18.
plugging this in the above renormalization group formula one obtains:

ms = 1.4  1012 gev ; sin2w (mz) = 0.239

(5.13)

where we have used 3(mz) = 0.12. taking into account that in this simple estimate we
have just made a one-loop computation and we have also assumed all light thresholds

at mz and all heavy thresholds close to ms, these are not unreasonable values, given
the uncertainties. in particular, not all elds which get masses through the vevs of (55)

scalars need to have identical masses and decouple at the same scale. for example, one

can check that if the 3 sets of right-handed vector-like leptons have masses below ms,
both the values obtained for sin2w and ms decrease accordingly.

in models like those of section 4.2 which are explicitly non supersymmetric, the

string scale must be at most of order 1-100 tev to avoid the hierarchy problem. thus

the usual eld theory logarithmic running will not be in general sucient to achieve

41

unication at such low string scale. other approaches like perhaps those of refs. [43,

44, 45, 46] (see also [19, 47, 48, 49] ) could be relevant. meanwhile one must admit

that models with only branes at xed points like the ones in section 4.1 seem to be

able to easily accommodate gauge coupling unication as long as the string scale is of

order of the intermediate scale which, as we mentioned above, is the natural one if we

have gravity mediated susy-breaking.

6 final comments and outlook

in this paper we have constructed the rst semirealistic string vacua using d-brane

techniques. we have showed that the addition of brane-antibrane pairs on otherwise

n = 1, d = 4 supersymmetric type i models is a quite versatile technique in order to

produce tachyon-free and rr tadpole-free string vacua resembling the standard model

of particle physics (or some left-right symmetric generalizations of it).

the vacua constructed are non-supersymmetric but the susy-breaking eects may

be felt in a suppressed manner in some subsectors of the theory. for example, the

sector identied with the sm may be separated in transverse compact space from the

susy-breaking anti-branes in such a way that only closed strings can transmit susy-

breaking to the observable physics world. this would correspond to a standard gravity

mediated scenario in which susy-breaking has to happen at the intermediate scale

mw mp lanck  1011 gev. these are the class of models presented in sections 4.1 and

4.3. since in this class of theories the susy-breaking scale is the string scale one would
have to identify ms with the intermediate scale also 11. we have explicitly shown how
in this class of theories one can indeed lower the string scale to these values and still

maintain consistency with the known values of planck mass and perturbative gauge

couplings. we have also shown that in some of the specic examples presented the

standard model couplings do indeed join at the intermediate scale. this comes about

because of the presence in these models of extra vector-like lepton generations or higgs

doublets.

in other constructions susy-breaking may be transmitted to the observable world

either by gauge mediation (as in the example in the appendix) or even at the tree level,

i.e., one can get some open string sectors with non-susy spectra. the latter is the

11in this setting only closed string states living in the bulk like the dilaton s and complex moduli

ti couple simultaneously to branes and antibranes. it is thus reasonable to expect that the susy-

breaking eects transmitted to the (99) and (59) observable sectors may be parametrized in terms of

vevs for the auxiliary elds of s, and ti, as propossed in refs. [50, 26].

42

case of the models presented in section 4.2. in this case the susy-breaking (and thus

the string scale) should not be above say 1-100 tev if we want to avoid the standard

hierarchy problem.

we have presented specic examples of string vacua with three generations and the

gauge group of the standard model or some of their left-right symmetric extensions but

one can construct many more along similar lines. the models constructed provide for

specic examples in which recent ideas involving a string scale well below the planck

scale may be tested. their massless spectrum is quite simple compared with analogous

perturbative heterotic models constructed in the past. thus, for example, the left-right

symmetric model of section 4.2 contains just three quark-lepton generations and three

sets of higgsses in its massless spectrum. we have concentrated on the zz3 orientifold
because three generations are easily obtained in that case but it should be possible to

construct many more examples using other orientifolds.

we have not presented a detailed phenomenological analysis of the specic mod-

els presented which we leave for future work. we have however discussed the general

structure of u(1) anomaly cancellation and yukawa couplings which are the required in-

gredients for such a phenomenological analysis. in general there are several anomalous

u(1)s whose anomalies are cancelled by the generalized green-schwarz mechanism dis-

cussed in ref. [30]. there are associated fayet-iliopoulos terms which are controlled by

the blowing-up moduli of the orbifold. generically only the standard hypercharge u(1)

remains unbroken down to low energies in the explicit sm orientifolds constructed. the

broken u(1) symmetries lead to some avour structure for the models which deserve

further analysis since they very much determine the structure of yukawa couplings and

hence questions like fermion textures and proton stability.

it is perhaps instructive to compare this class of realistic type i vacua with those

rst constructed in ref.[35] in the context of zz3 heterotic perturbative orbifolds. mod-
els like the ones we have constructed here do not have a perturbative heterotic dual

since, e.g., the gauge shifts v and wilson lines w used do not obey the standard

modular invariance constraints. however the models in refs.[35] have a number of

similarities (and also important dierences) with the ones built here. one of the sim-

ilarities is that the models constructed with both techniques have a tendency to give

rise to the presence of extra vector-like sets of leptons at low energies. however, impor-

tant aspects like the structure of yukawa couplings are totally dierent. in general the

type i constructions are much simpler in most respects: 1) only the addition of one

wilson line is required in type i whereas two wilson lines (leading to a proliferation

43

of twisted sectors and massless states) are required in the heterotic models. 2) in the

heterotic models the necessary presence of a non-vanishing (dilaton-dependent) fayet-

iliopoulos term makes also the identication of the correct perturbative vacuum quite

cumbersome, making a detailed analysis of the eective eld-theory d-at directions

necessary. in the type i case models one can put in principle the fi-terms to zero and

no complicated analysis of at directions is needed. 3) in the type i case one can lower

the string scale down to the intermediate scale and achieve gauge coupling unication.

the possibility of lowering the scale is not available in perturbative heterotic models

and this makes dicult to achieve gauge coupling unication. 4) in the type i models

here constructed susy-breaking (in a hidden sector or not) is a built-in property of

the models. in perturbative heterotic models one relies on the possible existence of

some hierarchy-generating mechanism like gaugino condensation in order to give rise

to susy-breaking.

an interesting dierence between these models and the perturbative heterotic mod-

els is the rank of the gauge group. in perturbative models, the rank cannot exceed

22 and in orbifold models at generic values of the moduli space of the six dimensional

compact space, the gauge group has rank 16. in the present models, the rank of the

group coming from the 9-branes is also 16. on the other hand, the rank of the groups
coming from the 5 and 5 branes may be very large, depending on the values of ns and
it seems to be unlimited. we may easily see this by considering the tadpole conditions

(3.10 ). if for instance the left hand side of those equations vanishes, as in the super-
symmetric case, we can have, say ni
2 = 2k with k arbitrarily large
and all equations will be satised. this seems to imply that as long as the number of

1 = 2mi

2 = 2pi

1 = qi

branes and anti branes is equal there is a lot of freedom to satisfy the tadpole condi-

tions and an arbitrary number of brane and anti branes can be added satisfying those

conditions, the corresponding rank of the gauge groups increases linearly with k and

we have no bound on this value. it was known previously that non perturbative string

vacua can have rank much larger than 22. here, we seem to have explicit models with

an unbounded rank, bringing the dierence with perturbative vacua to the extreme.

however we expect these higher rank models to be unstable and decay to the lowest

rank models, the reason being the following:
the tadpole equations with say ni
of branes that still keeps the conditions satised (ni

if in the example above we can satisfy
1 = 0. the addition of an arbitrary number
1 = 2k) is not necessary
for tadpole cancellation therefore the corresponding extra branes (and anti-branes) do

1 = 2mi

1 = mi

not need to be trapped at the xed points. we then expect that those congurations

44

will decay to the one with the minimum number of branes required by the tadpole

conditions, which are the only ones forced to be trapped at the xed points. all the

extra branes and anti-branes may annihilate each other in the bulk. recall that the

explicit models we have presented require the minimum number of branes and anti

branes.

one open question that one should study more carefully is that of the stability of

this class of vacua. as we remarked above, these models are free of tachyons both in

the bulk and on the branes. some of the branes and/or anti-branes are stuck at some

of the xed points of the underlying orbifold due to the tadpole cancellation conditions

and hence they are not free to travel to the bulk and give rise to complete brane-

antibrane annihilation. the existence of these trapped branes may lead to dynamical

eects tending to shrink some of the compact dimensions and no others as discussed

in the text.

these are rst steps in the search for realistic string vacua with the d-brane tech-

niques. much work remains to be done in this direction both from the theoretical side,

nding new classes of vacua and addressing the important dynamical issues involved in

this class of theories, as well as from the phenomenological side, studying the viability

of specic examples as well as extracting general properties which could be generic.

we hope we have convinced the readers of the interest of such a search.

7 appendix

7.1 a model with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking

the class of models with 9-branes and 5-branes discussed in chapter 3 allow also for the

construction of simple models in which the supersymmetry breaking eects originated

from anti-5-branes is transmitted to an observable world of 5-branes through loops

involving gauge interactions from the 9-branes living in the bulk. in particular, the

susy chiral multiplets in (59) sectors couple through (99) sector gauge interactions to
the non-susy (59) sector.

consider as an example the following zz3 orientifold. we take the 32 9-branes with

twist on cp factors given by:

,9 = diag(i18, i7, 2i7)

(7.1)

now, since tr ,9 = 11, tadpole cancellation conditions at each of the 9 xed points in
the rst two complex planes require:

now, we will locate 10 5-branes at each of 4 xed points with:

tr ,5  tr ,5 = 5

,5 = diag(i5, 2i5)

and at each of the remaining 5 xed points 8 anti-5-branes with

,5 = diag(i6, , 2) .

the complete gauge group is:

[u(5)4]5  [so(18)  u(7)]9  [(sp(6)  u(1))5]5

(7.2)

(7.3)

(7.4)

(7.5)

we can now identify one of the four su(5)s with the observable physical world. in

the (55) sector one has charged chiral multiplets transforming like: 2(10) + 15 under
su(5). now, from the (59) sector we will get supermultiplets transforming like (18, 1; 5)
+(1, 7; 5) under so(18)su(7)su(5). altogether the su(5) charged spectrum will
contain 2(10 + 5) + (15 + 9(5)) +7(5 + 5). this is an anomaly-free spectrum with two
standard plus one exotic su(5) generations. this spectrum is totally supersymmetric
but it will get non-susy corrections in loops coming from their couplings of so(18)
u(7) gauge bosons to the non-susy (59) sector. although this particular model is not
very realistic, it exemplies how in this type of vacua one can indeed obtain models

with gauge mediated susy breaking as advertised in the text.

46

7.2 a variant sm

one can construct many variations on the models presented in sections 4.1 and 4.2.
the su(3)  su(2)  u(1) model of 4.2 has the right-handed quarks in a non-susy
sector of the theory. this can be easily modied and e.g., one can get a variation of

the model in which only the leptons have a non-susy spectrum. let us rst start with

the model with only 5-branes at the xed points and then we will discus the model

with both branes and anti-branes at the xed points. take the zz3 orientifold with an
action of the twist on the cp factors given by :

v9 = 1/3(1, 1, 1,1,1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

a quantized wilson line is added in the rst complex plane given by:

w9 = 1/3(1, 1, 1, 1, 1,1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

(7.6)

(7.7)

the gauge group from the (99) sector will be u(3)u(2)u(1)[so(6)u(7)]. now,
the 9 zz3 xed points in the rst two complex planes split into three sets of three xed
points each : (0, m), (1, m) and (1, m) with m = 0,1. the shifts corresponding to
each of these three sets are v , v + w and v  w respectively. the corresponding
value for tr ,9 are -4, -1 and 2 respectively. looking at the tadpole cancellation
conditions we see that we will be forced to add 5-branes at the xed points (1, m) with
tr ,5 = 1 and also at the xed points (1, m) with tr ,5 = 2. no 5-branes have
to be added to the points (0, m) since tadpoles cancel without them. thus the simplest

option is to locate 5-branes with twist actions given by :

(1, m)  ,5 = diag (, 2)
(1, m)  ,5 = diag (i2, 2i2)

(7.8)

one gets the following massless spectrum:

(99):

there are chiral multiplets transforming under the gauge group like (the hyper-

charge u(1) generator is as in section 4.1):

3(3, 2, 1/6) + 3(3, 1,2/3) + 3(1, 2, +1/2) + [3(21) + 3(6, 7)]

(7.9)

these elds correspond to 3 generations of left-handed quarks and right-handed u-

quarks as well as three sets of higgs elds hu .

(59) :

47

from the 5-branes at the (1, m) xed points we get a u(1)3

5 gauge group. one then

nds chiral multiplets (in three copies, one per xed point) transforming like:

(3, 1, 1/3)q + (1, 1,1)q + (1, 2,1/2)q + (1, 2, 1/2)q + [7

q + 6

q]

(7.10)

where the subindex q refers to the u(1)3

5 charges. these elds include three generations
of right-handed d-quarks and three sets of vector-like doublets . the latter can become
massive if the singlets in the (55) sectors get a vev. from the 5-branes at the (1, m)
xed points we get a u(2)3 gauge group. one then nds chiral multiplets (in three

copies, one per xed point) transforming like:

(1, 2,1/2; 2)r + (1, 1, +1; 2)r + (3, 1, 1/3; 2)r + (3, 1,1/3; 2)r (7.11)

+ [(7; 2)r + 6

r]

where the subindex r refers to the u(1)3

5 charges. this sector includes all leptons and
additional weakly interacting particles (as well as vector-like sets of extra color triplets).
now, the (55) sector living on the (1, m) xed points contain an adjoint under the
su(2)s which can get a vev along a at direction and give a mass to the triplet anti-

triplet pairs in the corresponding (59) sector. altogether this model contains at the

massless level three standard quark-lepton generations plus three sets of vector-like

right- and left-handed extra leptons.

as we did in section 4.2, one can construct a related model with both 5- and anti-5-

branes all stuck at the xed points. the simplest possibility is to replace the 5-branes
at the (1, m) xed points by anti-5-branes. we put two anti-5-branes with ,5 = (i2).
this meets the tadpole conditions and leads to a group sp(2)3. now, the spectrum of

this model is similar to the previous one but replacing the susy spectrum in (7.12)

by the following (non-susy) one:

(59) :

f ermions :

scalars :

(1, 2,1/2; 2) + (1, 1, +1; 2) + [(7; 2)]
(3, 1, 1/3; 2) + (3, 1,1/3; 2) + [(6; 2)]

(7.12)

as in the previous situation, this sector provides for the leptons which then are the
only non-susy sector of the model. the 55 sector contains only one negative chirality
triplet for each of the sp(2) groups.

48

7.3 another variant sm

here we will just write the spectrum of the other model discussed at the beginning of
section 4 containing su(3)  su(2)  u(1). n2 = 9, n0 = 1; ni
0 = 1. the
full gauge group is

1 = mi

1 = mi

[su(3)  su(2)  u(1)]  u(1)3  [so(2)  u(9)]  sp(2)6  u(1)3

(7.13)

the hypercharge generator can be dened as in the previous models. the spectrum is

99 sector:

3 [(3, 2, 1/6) + (1, 2, 1/2) + (3, 1,2/3)] + 3 [(2, 9) + (1, 36)]

(7.14)

again this sector can incorporate the three families of left handed quarks and right

handed u-quarks together with three sets of higgs elds hu .

from the 5-branes at the points l0 we have:
5l09 sector:

3 [(3, 1, 1/3; 2) + (1, 2,1/2; 2) + (1, 9; 2)]

(7.15)

where the index after the semicolon is the sp(2) representation (one dierent for

each xed point). here we have candidate leptons and right handed d-quarks, although

they are doublets of sp(2) also. from the 5-branes at the points l1 the massless
spectrum is:

5l19 sector:

3 [(3, 1, 1/3)q + (1, 2,1/2)q + (1, 2, 1/2)q + (1, 1,1)q + (2, 1)

q + (1, 9)
q]

+3 [(3, 1,1/3; 2) + (1, 1,1; 2)] + (1, 9; 2)] (7.16)
where the subindices q are the charges with respect to each of the three u(1)s

coming from the 5-branes. here we also have candidate leptons and right handed

d-quarks.

finally, the massless spectrum of the 55 sector transform under each sp(2)  u(1)

at the l1 xed points as: 55l1 sector:

3 [(2)q + 2 (1)2q + (1)2q]

(7.17)

contrary to the previous models, it is not clear how in this model all the extra

(unwanted) triplets and doublets can get a mass, therefore this model looks at rst

49

sight less interesting phenomenologically, although a detailed study may reveal ways

of making it more realistic. a similar model can be obtained by substituting the
branes at the l1 points by four anti branes (qi
1 = 1). therefore the spectrum is the
same except for the 5l19 sector above which is changed by the nonsupersymmetric one

(with opposite chirality) in three copies:

f ermions :

scalars :

(3, 1, 1/3)r + (1, 2, 1/2)r + (1, 2,1/2)r + (1, 1, +1)r
+ [(2, 1)
(3, 1,1/3)r + (1, 1, +1)r + [(1, 9)

r + (1, 9)
r]

r] + h.c.

(7.18)

where r is the charge with respect to each of the u(1)s coming from the anti
branes. the 55l1 also replaces the 55l1 sector which consists of three fermions and six
scalars (singlets) with charge 2r. it also includes three extra singlets with negative
chirality. therefore, we may have here both leptons and right handed d-quarks in a

non-supersymmetric sector.

7.4 continuous wilson lines. models with adjoint represen-

tations

as we have stressed, in contrast to what happens in supersymmetric models, the ad-

dition of antibranes allows for several consistent twist matrices and wilson lines. in

particular continuous wilson lines can be easily included. this is an interesting pos-

sibility for model building since it can be used for reducing the gauge groups ranks

and for obtaining adjoint representations. here we show how continuous wilson lines

can be introduced in zz3 orientifold discussed in section 3. let us consider the case
n1 = n3 = n4 = n, and thus n0 + n2 = 16  n in 2.2 and rewrite the twist matrix
and discrete wilson line w in terms of 3n  3n and (16  3n)  (16  3n) matrices
as  = (diag, 2) where

and

diag = diag (in , in , 2in )

2 = diag (in0, in2)

w = diag (in , in , in ; in0, in2)

(7.19)

(7.20)

(7.21)

hence, the gauge group u(n)3  so(2n0)  u(n2) is obtained, and the massless

50

spectrum can be read from 3.12 to be 12

3[(n, n, 1; 1, 1) + (1, n, n, 1; 1, 1) + (n, 1, n; 1, 1)] +

+3[(1, 1, 1; 2n0, n2) + (1, 1, 1; 1, a2)]

(7.22)

(7.23)

which is invariant under the permutations of the u(n) gauge groups. moreover,
by giving appropriate vevs to (n, n) multiplets, u(n)3 group should break down to
the diagonal subgroup su(n)diag  u(1), leaving three adjoint representations in the
spectrum.

in particular an su(5), group with three 24 massless representations could be

obtainable. however, since antisymmetric representations of the 99 gauge group cannot

appear in crossed sectors, the model is expected to e non chiral.

such a breaking is easily achieved by considering a continuous wilson line of the

type presented in [11]. namely,

w = 


wdiag

0

0

1n0+n2




(7.24)

a 16  16 matrix, where wdiag is a 3n  3n matrix (which acts on diag), dened as

wdiag =





 a a

a  a

a a 





(7.25)

where a and  are arbitrary complex numbers and each block is a n  n matrix. it is
straightforward to check that (diagwdiag)3 = ci3n where

c = (3  3a2 + 2a3)

and also tr (diagw k

diag) = 0 k = 0, 1, 2. therefore

tr 9(w)k = 2n0  n2

(7.26)

(7.27)

for k = 0, 1, 2.

thus, we see that for a 6= 0 (and /a 6= 1,2) a can be chosen such that c = 1.
hence, we are still left with a complex continuous parameter dening a continuous

wilson line [51, 11].

12 there we must perform the replacement n4  n4, due to the term 2in4 in the twist matrix

above

51

performing the usual projections, such a continuous wilson line achieves the desired

breaking to the diagonal group by keeping three adjoints in the 99 spectrum. as

mentioned, chiral generations do not appear in this sector.

from (7.27) we see that the contribution to tadpole equation (3.6)comes only from

the non rotated piece. therefore, we have

2n0  n2 + 3(tr ,5,l  tr ,5,l) = 4

(7.28)

with n0 + n2 = 16  3v. this constraint can be satised, for instance, by placing ve
branes at each of the nine zz3 xed points, satisfying tr ,5,l = 1
3(4 + 2n0  n2) =
12 + 2n + n2 and the same number of antibranes in the bulk. other choices, with
branes and antibranes stuck a these points are also possible.

for instance, for n = 5 and choosing n2 = 1, tadpole equations are satised by
placing two ve branes with ,5,l = (i1, 2i1) (thus leading to a u(1) group at each
55li

a sector) and eighteen antibranes in the bulk.
this choice leads to (su(5) u(1))diag  u(1) gauge group with three

representations in the 99 sector. we also have 51 + 51 and 51 + 51 non chiral
combinations at each of the nine xed points, where the subindex indicates the charge

24 adjoint

with respect to the u(1)55 group at each point.
