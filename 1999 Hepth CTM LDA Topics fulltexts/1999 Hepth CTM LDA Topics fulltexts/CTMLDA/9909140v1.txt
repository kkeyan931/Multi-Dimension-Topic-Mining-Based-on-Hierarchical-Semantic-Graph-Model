we present a general construction of all correlation functions of a two-dimensional
rational conformal eld theory, for an arbitrary number of bulk and boundary elds
and arbitrary topologies. the correlators are expressed in terms of wilson graphs
in a certain three-manifold, the connecting manifold. the amplitudes constructed
this way can be shown to be modular invariant and to obey the correct factorization
rules.

two-dimensional conformal eld theory plays a fundamental role in the theory of two-
dimensional critical systems of classical statistical mechanics [1], in quasi one-dimensional con-
densed matter physics [2] and in string theory [3]. the study of defects in systems of condensed
matter physics [4], of percolation probabilities [5] and of (open) string perturbation theory
in the background of certain string solitons, the so-called d-branes [6], forces one to analyze
conformal eld theories on surfaces that may have boundaries and / or can be non-orientable.
in this letter we present a new description of correlation functions of an arbitrary number
of bulk and boundary elds on general surfaces. we also show how to compute various types
of operator product coecients from our formulas. for simplicity, in this letter we restrict
our attention to boundary conditions that preserve all bulk symmetries. moreover, we take
the modular invariant torus partition function that encodes the spectrum of bulk elds of the
theory to be given by charge conjugation. technical details and complete proofs will appear in
a separate publication.

given a chiral conformal eld theory, such as a chiral free boson, our aim is to compute
correlation functions on a two-dimensional surface x that may be non-orientable and can have
a boundary. to this end, we rst construct the so-called double x of the surface x. this
is an oriented surface, on which an orientation reversing map  of order two acts in such a
way that x is obtained as the quotient of x by . thus x is a two-fold cover of x; but this
cover is branched over the boundary points, which correspond to xed points of the map .
for example, when x is the disk d, then x is the two-sphere and  is the reection about
its equatorial plane. for x the cross-cap, i.e. the real projective plane rp2, x is again the
two-sphere, but  is now the antipodal map. finally, when x is closed and orientable, the
double x consists of two disconnected copies of x with opposite orientation, x = x(x).

quite generally, correlation functions on a surface x can be constructed from conformal
blocks on its double x [7,8]. as a rst step, one has to nd the pre-images on x of all insertion
points on x, and associate a primary eld of the chiral conformal eld theory to each of them.
since bulk points have two pre-images, for a bulk eld two chiral labels j and j  are needed,
corresponding to left and right movers. boundary elds, in contrast, carry a single label k; yet,
they should not be thought of as chiral objects.

having associated these labels to the geometric data, we can assign a vector space of confor-
mal blocks, not necessarily of dimension one, to every collection of bulk and boundary elds on
x. the correlation function is one specic element in this space. this element must obey mod-
ular invariance and factorization properties. the conformal bootstrap programme [3] allows to
determine the correlation function by imposing these properties as constraints. fortunately,
the connection between conformal eld theory in two dimensions and topological eld theory
in three dimensions supplies us with a most direct way to construct concrete elements in the
spaces of conformal blocks. we briey describe this construction for wzw models, where
chern--simons theory can be used [9, 10]. (but these methods can be generalized to arbitrary
rational conformal eld theories. for details, which are based on the axiomatization in [11], we
refer to [12].) what one must do is to nd a three-manifold mx whose boundary is x,

as well as a wilson graph w in mx that ends at the marked points on x. performing the path

of the chern--simons theory with appropriate parabolic conditions at the insertion points then
species a denite element in the space of conformal blocks.

thus to obtain a correlation function on x, we rst construct a certain three-manifold mx
with boundary x, which we call the connecting three-manifold . technically, the manifold mx
can be characterized as follows. when x does not have a boundary, then mx = ( x  [1,1])/z2,
where the group z2 acts on x by  and on the interval [1,1] by the sign ip t 7 t for
t  [1,1]. thus mx consists of pairs (x, t) with x a point on the double x and t in [1,1],
modulo the identication (x, t)  ((x), t). for xed x, the points of the form (x, t) form a
segment, the connecting interval , joining the two pre-images of a point in x. when x has
a boundary, we obtain mx from ( x  [1,1])/z2 by contracting the connecting intervals over
the boundary to single points, in such a way that mx remains a smooth manifold.

it is readily checked that the boundary of the connecting manifold mx is indeed the double
x. moreover, mx connects the two pre-images of a bulk point by an interval in such a manner
that the connecting intervals for distinct bulk points do not intersect. let us list a few examples.
for a disk, the connecting manifold is a solid three-ball, and the connecting intervals are all
perpendicular to the equatorial plane. similarly, when x is the annulus, mx is a solid torus.
for x the cross-cap, the connecting manifold mx is best characterized by the fact that when
= rp3, which coincides with the group
glueing to its boundary a solid ball, we obtain s3/z2
manifold of the lie group so(3). for closed orientable surfaces x, the bundle mx is just the
trivial bundle x  [1,1]; e.g. when x is a sphere, then mx can be visualized as consisting of
the points between two concentric spheres.

the next step is to specify a certain wilson graph in mx. the prescription, which is
illustrated in gure 1 for the case of a disk with an arbitrary number of insertions in the bulk
and on the boundary, is as follows. first, for every bulk insertion j, one joins the pre-images
of the insertion point by a wilson line running along the connecting interval. next, one inserts
one circular wilson line parallel to each component of the boundary and joins every boundary
insertion k on the respective boundary component by a short wilson line to the corresponding
circular wilson line. moreover, the circular wilson lines are required to run close to the
boundary, in the sense that none of the connecting intervals of the bulk elds passes between
the circular wilson lines and the boundary of x.

so far we have only specied the geometric information for the conformal blocks. to proceed,
we also must attach a primary label of the chiral conformal eld theory to each segment of the
wilson graph. for the bulk points, this prescription is immediate, as we are dealing with the
charge conjugation modular invariant. similarly, we are naturally provided with the labels k for
the short wilson lines that connect the boundary insertions with the circular wilson lines. in
addition, the segments of the circular wilson lines should encode the boundary conditions of the
corresponding boundary segments. recalling that those boundary conditions which preserve all
bulk symmetries can be labelled by the primary elds of the chiral conformal eld theory [13],
we attach such a primary label a to every segment of the circular wilson lines. finally, we must
consider the three-valent junctions on the circular wilson lines. for each of them we choose
an element  in the space of chiral couplings between the label k for the boundary eld and

figure 1: wilson graph for the disk correlators

the two adjacent boundary conditions a, b. the dimension of this space of couplings is given
by the fusion rules n a
kb of the chiral theory. indeed, it is known that boundary operators need
an additional degeneracy label that takes its values in the space of chiral three-point blocks.

as a matter of fact, every segment of the wilson graph should also be equipped with a
framing [9]  in other words, we should not just specify a graph, but a ribbon graph. moreover,
the boundary x of mx must be endowed with additional structure, too. a careful discussion
of these issues will be presented in [12]. as a side remark, we mention that the circular wilson
lines already come with a natural thickening to ribbons, which is obtained by connecting them
to the pre-image of the boundary of x in x. (in gure 1 this is indicated by a shading.) note
that in the case of symmetry breaking boundary conditions [14] the labels of boundary elds
and boundary conditions can be more general than in the bulk. this can be implemented in
our picture, as the corresponding part of the graph with the circular wilson line is disconnected
from the rest of the wilson graph.

using appropriate surgery on three-manifolds, we can prove that the correlation functions
obtained by our prescription possess the correct factorization (or sewing) properties and that
they are invariant under large dieomorphisms or, in more technical terms, under the relative
modular group [15]. for a detailed account of these issues we refer to [12]. here we restrict
ourselves to the analysis of a few situations of particular interest; we also show how to recover
known results for the structure constants from our formulas.

in our approach the structure constants are obtained as the coecients that appear in the
expansion of the specic element in the space of conformal blocks that represents a correlation
function in a standard basis for the conformal blocks. for two points on the boundary of a solid
three-ball such a standard basis is given by a wilson line (with trivial framing) connecting the
two points, while for three points one takes a mercedes star shaped junction of three wilson
lines. our general strategy for computing the coecients is then to glue another three-manifold
to the connecting manifold so as to obtain the partition function or, in mathematical terms,
the link invariant, for a closed three-manifold. the values of such link invariants are available
in the literature, see e.g. [9, 10, 11, 16].

our rst example is the correlator of two (bulk) elds on s2, a closed and orientable surface.
for the space of blocks to be non-zero, the two elds must be conjugate, i.e. carry labels j and
j , respectively. according to our prescription, the connecting manifold then consists of the
lling between two concentric two-spheres, and the wilson graph consists of two disjoint lines
connecting the spheres, both labelled by j; this is depicted in gure 2. the space of conformal

blocks for this situation is one-dimensional; its standard basis is displayed in gure 3. thus the
relevant three-manifold is given by the disconnected sum of two balls, each of which carries a
single wilson line. to both manifolds we glue two balls in which a wilson line labelled by j is
running. in the case of the correlation function, the resulting manifold is a three-sphere with
an unknot labelled by j, for which the value of the link invariant is s0,j. (s is the modular s-
transformation matrix of the chiral conformal eld theory, and the label 0 refers to the vacuum
primary eld.) when applied to the manifold in gure 3, the glueing procedure produces two
disjoint copies of s3, each with an unknot labelled by j; the corresponding partition function is
s2
0,j. comparing the two results we see that the two-point function on the sphere is expressed
in terms of the standard basis as

c(s2; j, j ) = s 1

0,j  b(s2; j, j )  b(s2; j, j ) .

(3)

in other words, the normalization of the bulk elds j diers from the more conventional pre-
scription in which they are canonically normalized to one by a factor of (s0,j)1/2.

figure 2: c(s2; j, j )

figure 3: b(s2; j, j )  b(s2; j, j )

next we discuss an example featuring an orientable surface with boundary; we compute the
one-point amplitude for a bulk eld j on a disk d with boundary condition a. again the space
of blocks is one-dimensional. our task is then to compare the wilson graph of gure 4 with the
standard basis that is displayed in gure 5. (in the present context, this particular conformal
block is often called an ishibashi state). we now obtain the three-sphere by glueing with a
single three-ball. when applied to the graph of gure 5, we get the unknot with label j in s3,
for which the partition function is s0,j. in the case of gure 4 we get a pair of linked wilson
lines with labels a and j in s3; the value of the link invariant for this graph is sa,j. comparison
thus shows that the correlation function is sa,j/s0,j times the standard two-point block on the
sphere,

c(da; j) = (sa,j/s0,j)  b(s2; j, j ) .

(4)

taking into account the normalization of the bulk elds as obtained in formula (3), we recover
the known result that the correlator for a canonically normalized bulk eld j on a disk with

boundary condition a is sa,j/ps0,j times the standard two-point block on the sphere. (this

relation forms the basis of the so-called boundary state formalism [13].)

as a third example, we study again a one-point correlator of a (bulk) eld j, now on the
cross-cap rp2, which does not have a boundary, but is non-orientable. the latter property
forces us to be careful with the framing. the structure constants are obtained by comparing
the correlator c(rp2; j) with the cross-cap state j. this state is dened in gure 6; it is
similar to the basis element b(s2; j, j ) of the two-point blocks on s2, but now the wilson line
in the three-ball has a non-trivial framing, and accordingly in gure 6 we have drawn a ribbon
instead of a line. a priori we could twist the line either by +, thereby obtaining some state
+
j . these two vectors dier by a factor of e2ij , with
j the conformal weight of j. salomonically, we dene the cross-cap state as

j , or by  and obtain another state 

j := eij 

j = eij +
j .

(5)

again the comparison of the correlator c(rp2; j) with the standard basis j is carried out by
glueing a three-ball with a wilson line to the ball of gure 6. in contrast to the previous cases,
however, this line is given a non-trivial framing; choosing the framing in such a way that the
twist of the cross-cap state is undone, glueing the ball to the cross-cap state yields s3 with the
unknot, with partition function z(s3; j) = s0,j.

as already mentioned, glueing the three-ball to the connecting manifold of the cross-cap
yields so(3). it is also known that so(3) can be obtained from s3 by a surgery on the unknot
with framing 2. (following how the framed graph is mapped by the surgery, one may visualize
the situation as in gure 7.) taking all framings properly into account, we obtain

expressed the result through the matrix [17] p := t 1/2st 2st 1/2. we have thereby recovered

c(rp2; j) = (p0,j/s0,j)  j

as a nal example, consider three boundary elds i, j, k on a disk. the relevant wilson
graph in the three-ball is of the type shown in gure 1, without any vertical wilson lines
along connecting intervals; it consists of a circular line (with segments labelled a, b, c) with
three short wilson lines (labelled i, j, k) attached to it. we must compare it to the standard
basis for three-point blocks on the sphere, which is a mercedes star shaped junction. this
comparison can be made by performing a single fusing operation, followed by a contraction
of the loop. for boundary elds, it is natural to dene the correlation functions as linear
forms on the degeneracy spaces for boundary operators. denoting a basis of the degeneracy
space for the boundary operator ac
i by {e[ica]}, normalized by the quantum trace condition
tr (e[ica] e[iac]) = ,, we nd that

 denotes a fusing matrix (or quantum 6j-symbol) [16, 11].

one important conclusion we can draw from our results is that the construction of correlation
functions from conformal blocks can be performed in a completely model-independent manner.
all structure constants, for any arbitrary conformal eld theory, can be expressed in terms

of purely chiral data, such as conformal weights, the modular s-matrix, fusing matrices and
the like. all specic properties of concrete models already enter at the chiral level. physical
quantities, such as the magnetization of an open spin chain or open string amplitudes in the
background of d-branes, can be expressed in terms of the correlators studied in this letter.
