abstract

in the context of the freefermionic formulation of the heterotic superstring, we construct
a three generation n = 1 supersymmetric su(4) su(2)l  su(2)r model supplemented
by an su(8) hidden gauge symmetry and ve abelian factors. the symmetry breaking to
the standard model is achieved using vacuum expectation values of a higgs pair in (4, 2r)+
(4, 2r) at a high scale. one linear combination of the abelian symmetries is anomalous
and is broken by vacuum expectation values of singlet elds along the at directions of the
superpotential. all consistent string vacua of the model are completely classied by solving
the corresponding system of f and datness equations including nonrenormalizable
terms up to sixth order. the requirement of existence of electroweak massless doublets
further restricts the phenomenologically viable vacua. the third generation fermions receive
masses from the treelevel superpotential. further, a complete calculation of all non
renormalizable fermion mass terms up to fth order shows that in certain string vacua the
hierarchy of the fermion families is naturally obtained in the model as the second and third
generation fermions earn their mass from fourth and fth order terms. along certain at
directions it is shown that the ratio of the su(4) breaking scale and the reduced planck
mass is equal to the up quark ratio mc/mt at the string scale. an additional prediction of
the model, is the existence of a u(1) symmetry carried by the elds of the hidden sector,
ensuring thus the stability of the lightest hidden state. it is proposed that the hidden states
may account for the invisible matter of the universe.

1 introduction

during the last decade, a lot of work has been devoted in the construction of eective low
energy models of elementary particles from the heterotic superstring. several old successful
n = 1 supersymmetric grand unied theories (guts) have been recovered through the
string approach [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], however only few of them were able to rederive a number
of successful predictions of their predecessors. yet, new avenues and radical ideas that were
previously not considered or only poorly explored, have now been painstakingly investigated
in the context of string derived or even string inspired eective theories. among them,
the issue of the additional u(1)symmetries which naturally appear in string models and
the systematic derivation of nonrenormalizable terms boosted our understanding of the
observed mass hierarchies and impelled people to systematically classify all possible textures
consistent with the low energy phenomenology. further, new and astonishingly simpler
mechanisms of gut symmetry breaking were introduced due to the absence of large higgs
representations, at least in the simplest kacmoody level (k = 1) string constructions.

in addition to the above good omen, some embarrassing diculties have also appeared,
such as the existence of unconned fractionally charged states  which belong to repre-
sentations not incorporated in the usual guts  and the very high unication scale. the
new representations come as a result of the breaking of the large string symmetry via the
gso projections. the appearance of such states are not necessarily an ominous warning
for a particular model, although a mechanism should be invented to make them disappear
from the light spectrum. the real major diculty however, was the generic property of the
high string scale in contrast to the usual supersymmetric guts which unify at about two
orders of magnitude below the string mass. in the weakly coupled heterotic string theory,
this problem can nd a solution in specic models, when extra matter multiplets exist to
properly modify the running of the gauge couplings, or possible intermediate symmetries
and string threshold eects [7] can help gauge couplings converge to their experimentally
determined values at low energies.

in this paper, we derive an improved version of a string model proposed in [5], based on
the observable gauge symmetry so(6)  o(4) (isomorphic to su(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r
patisalam (ps) gauge group [8]) in the context of the freefermionic formulation of the
four dimensional superstring. as shown in [4] this gauge symmetry breaks down to the
standard model without the use of the adjoint or any higher representation thus it can be
built directly at the k = 1 kacmoody level. (higher kacmoody level models are also
possible to build, however, they imply small unication scale values of sin2 w [9].)

the models based on the ps gauge symmetry have also certain phenomenological ad-
vantages. among them, is the absence of coloured gauge elds mediating proton decay.
this fact allows for the possibility of having a low su(4) breaking scale compared to that
of other guts, provided that the higgs coloured elds do not have dangerous yukawa cou-
plings with ordinary matter. possible ways to avoid fast proton decay have been discussed
also recently in the literature [10].

moreover, specic gut relations among the yukawa couplings, like the bottomtau
equality, give successful predictions at low energies, while at the same time such relations

1

reduce the number of arbitrary yukawa couplings even in the eldtheory version.

the above nice features are exhibited in the present string construction. using a variant
of the original string basis and the gso projection coecients [5], we obtain an eective
eld theory model with three generations and exactly one higgs pair to break the su(4)
su(2)r gauge symmetry. the eective low energy theory is the n = 1 supersymmetric
su(3)  su(2)  u(1) electroweak standard gauge symmetry broken to su(3)  u(1)em
by the two higgs doublet elds. we derive the complete massless spectrum of the model
and the yukawa interactions including nonrenormalizable terms up to sixth order. among
the massless states, a mirror (half)family is also obtained which acquires mass at a very
large scale. there are also singlet elds and exotic doublet representations with a sucient
number of yukawa couplings. all the observable and hidden elds appear with charges
under ve surplus u(1) factors where one linear combination of them is anomalous. the
anomalous u(1) symmetry generates a dterm contribution, which can be cancelled if
some of the singlet elds acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values (vevs). to nd the
true vacua, we solve the f and datness conditions and classify all possible solutions
involving observable elds with nonzero vevs. we analyze in detail three characteristic
cases where superpotential contributions up to sixth order suce to provide fermion mass
terms for all generations. phenomenologically interesting alternative solutions are also
proposed in the case where some of the hidden elds develop vevs too.

among the novel features of the present model is the existence of a u(1) symmetry 
carried by hidden and exotic elds  which remains unbroken. as a consequence, the lightest
hidden state is stable. these states form various potential mass terms in the superpotential
of the model. in our analysis, we show the existence of proper at directions where the
lightest state obtains a mass at an intermediate scale, leading to interesting cosmological
implications.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we give a brief description of the super-
symmetric version of the model and discuss various phenomenological features, including
the economical higgs mechanism, the mass spectrum and the renormalization group. in
particular we show how the patisalam symmetry dispenses with the use of higgs elds in
the adjoint of su(4) to break down to the standard model. in section 3, we propose the
string basis as well as the gso projections which yield the desired gauge symmetry and
the massless spectrum. in section 4 the gauge symmetry breaking of the string version
is analyzed. moreover, due to the existence of additional u(1) symmetries, the issue of
new (nonstandard) hypercharge embeddings is discussed. particular embeddings where
all fractionally charged states obtain integral charges are discussed in some detail. in sec-
tion 5 we derive the superpotential couplings and present a preliminary phenomenological
analysis to set the low energy constraints and reduce the number of phenomenologically
acceptable string vacua. in section 6 we classify all solutions of the f  and datness
equations including nonrenormalizable superpotential contributions up to sixth order. a
detailed phenomenological analysis of the promising string vacua in connection with their
low energy predictions is presented in section 7. particular attention is given in the dou-
blet higgs mass matrix, the fermion mass hierarchy and the colour triplet mass matrix.
in section 8, we present a brief discussion on the role of the hidden sector and extend

2

the solutions of string vacua including hidden eld vevs. finally, in the appendices ad
we present tables with the complete string spectrum, details about the derivation of the
higher order nonrenormalizable superpotential terms, the d and f  atness equations
with non-renormalizable contributions and the complete list of their treelevel solutions.

2 the supersymmetric su (4)  so(4) model
there is a minimal supersymmetric su(4)  o(4) model which can be considered as a
surrogate eective gut of the possible viable string versions, incorporating all the basic
features of a phenomenologically viable string model. the yukawa couplings are determined
by the patisalam (ps) gauge symmetry and possible additional u(1)family symmetries
which are usually added (as in any other gut) by phenomenological requirements, (i.e.,
fermion mass hierarchy, proton stability etc). this gut version, however, provides us
with insight in constructing the fully realistic string version. therefore, here we briey
summarize the parts of the model relevant for our analysis [4]. the gauge group is su(4)
o(4), or equivalently the ps gauge symmetry [8]

the lefthanded quarks and leptons are accommodated in the following representations,

su(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r.

l = (4, 2, 1) =   u

(3)

where  = 1, . . . , 4 is an su(4) index, a, x = 1, 2 are su(2)l,r indices, and i = 1, 2, 3 is a
family index. the higgs elds are contained in the following representations,

hx

a = (1, 2, 2) =   h+

where hd and hu are the low energy higgs superelds associated with the minimal super-
symmetric standard model (mssm). the two gut breaking higgs representations are

fermion generation multiplets transform to each other under the changes 4  4 and
2l  2r while the bidoublet higgs multiplet transforms to itself. however, the pair of

3

fourplethiggs elds does not have this property, discriminating 2l and 2r. thus, when
they develop vevs along their neutral components h, c
h,
h hi = hc
hi  mgu t

(7)
they break the su(4)  su(2)r part of the gauge group, leading to the standard model
symmetry at mgu t

hhi = hhi  mgu t ,

su(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r  su(3)c  su(2)l  u(1)y .

(8)

under the symmetry breaking in eq. (8), the bidoublet higgs eld h in eq. (4) splits into
two higgs doublets hu, hd whose neutral components subsequently develop weak scale vevs,

hhd

0i = v1,

hhu

0i = v2

(9)

with tan   v2/v1.

in addition to the higgs elds in eqs. (5),(6) the model also involves an su(4) sextet
eld d = (6, 1, 1) and four singlets 0 and i, i = 1, 2, 3. 0 is going to acquire a vev
of the order of the electroweak scale in order to realize the higgs doublet mixing, while
i will participate in an extended seesaw mechanism to obtain light majorana masses
for the lefthanded neutrinos. under the symmetry property 1,2,3  (1)  1,2,3 and
h( h)  (1)  h( h) the treelevel mass terms of the superpotential of the model read

where  = h0i  o(mw ). the last term generates the higgs mixing between the two sm
higgs doublets in order to prevent the appearance of a massless electroweak axion. the

in the basis (i, c
j , k). diagonalization of the above gives three light neutrinos with masses
of the order (mij
u /mgu t )2 as required by the low energy data, and leaves righthanded
majorana neutrinos with masses of the order mgu t . additional terms not included in
eq. (10) may be forbidden by imposing suitable discrete or continuous symmetries [11, 12]
which, in fact, mimic the role of various u(1) factors and string selection rules appearing in
realistic string models. the sextet eld d(6, 1, 1) carries colour, while after the symmetry
breaking it decomposes in a triplet/tripletbar pair with the same quantum numbers of
(10) hhd and h hd combine the uneaten
the down quarks. now, the terms in eq.
(down quarktype) colour triplet parts of h, h with those of the sextet d into acceptable
gutscale mass terms [4]. when the h elds attain their vevs at mgu t  1016 gev,
the superpotential of eq. (10) reduces to that of the mssm augmented by right-handed
neutrinos. below mgu t the part of the superpotential involving matter superelds is just

obtained from nonrenormalizable (nr) contributions to the superpotential. here, m
represents a high scale m > mgu t which may be identied either with the u(1)a breaking
scale ma or with the string scale mstring. such terms have the task of lling in the entries
of fermion mass matrices, creating textures with a hierarchical mass spectrum and mixing
eects between the fermion generations.

before we proceed to the construction of a particular string model let us examine how
a threegeneration su(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r model can be realized. as we have already
explained the fermion generations are accommodated in fl(4, 2, 1) + fr(4, 1, 2) while
the higgs elds are accommodated in fr(4, 1, 2) + fr(4, 1, 2) representations.
in the
freefermionic formulation the su(2)l  su(2)r is realized as o(4) and the 2l and 2r
representations are the two spinor representations (2) of o(4). calling n+, n, n+, n the
number of (4, 2+), (4, 2),(4, 2+) and (4, 2) representations we come to the conclusion
that one minimal three generation model is obtained for

~nmin = (n+, n, n+, n) = (3, 1, 0, 4)

where 2l is identied with 2+. a mirror minimal model can be obtained by interchanging
the two su(2)s, i.e. l  r, and identifying 2+  2r

~nmin = (n+, n, n+, n) = (1, 3, 4, 0).

5

furthermore, one can consider the existence of vectorlike states that do not aect the
net number of generations since, in principle they can obtain superheavy masses. thus a
general threegeneration su(4)su(2)lsu(2)r model corresponds to one the following
vectors

~nrs = (n+, n, n+, n) = (3 + r, 1 + s, r, 4 + s) , r, s = 0, 1, . . .

or

~nrs = (n+, n, n+, n) = (1 + s, 3 + r, 4 + s, r) , r, s = 0, 1, . . .

we can rewrite the above relations in a more compact form

n+ + n = n+ + n = 4 + p, p = 0, 1, 2, . . .
n+  n+ = n  n = 3

(15)

thus, there exist an innity of threegeneration su(4)o(4)  su(4)su(2)lsu(2)r
models each of them uniquely characterized by an integer (p) related to the dierences (15)
and a sign (). we will therefore refer to a particular model using the notation k that is
the two minimal models will be referred as 0+ and 0.

as stressed in the introduction, one severe problem that has to be resolved in a candidate
string model is the discrepancy between the unication scale as this is found when the
minimal supersymmetric spectrum is considered, and the two orders higher string scale
implied by theoretical calculations.
in previous works, it was shown that this diculty
may be overcome in several ways [13, 14]. in particular, the class of string models as that
of ref. [5] predict additional matter elds which can help the couplings merge at the high
string scale without disturbing the low energy values of sin2 w and s. perhaps the most
elegant way to achieve this, is to make the couplings run closely from the string to the
phenomenological unication scale mu  1016gev. as a rst step one may add the mirror
elds [14]

m = (4, 2, 1);

m = (4, 2, 1)

(16)

which guarantee the equality of the su(2)l and su(2)r gauge couplings gl = gr between
the two scales. according to the classication proposed to the previous paragraph, this
model is classied as 1+ or 1. the running of the su(4) coupling can be adjusted by
an additional number of extra colour sextets which are in general available in the string
versions of the present model. indeed, with three generations and denoting collectively the
number of fourplet sets with n4 the beta functions now become

b2l  b2r = 1  4n4;

b4 = 6  n6  4n4

(17)

which show that a sucient number of sextet elds may guarantee a g4 running almost
identical with that of gl,r. the string model we are proposing in the next section has
exactly one mirror pair and four sextet elds, whereas additional exotic states may also
contribute to the beta functions if they remain in the light spectrum.

the introduction of the mirror representations (16) leads to the existence of another
symmetry in the model: we observe that the whole spectrum now is completely symmetric

6

with respect to the two su(2)s in the sense that under the simultaneous change 2l  2r
and the 4  4 of su(4), it remains invariant. more precisely, under this symmetry the
representations of the model are mapped as follows
fr  fl
h, h  m , m
d, h, i  d, h, i

(18)

this symmetry persists also in the present string model, while treelevel as well as higher
order yukawa interactions are also invariant under these changes. as we will see, this
symmetry is broken by the vacuum which will be determined by the specic solutions of
the atness conditions.

after the above short description, we are ready to present the string derived model
where most of the above features appear naturally.
in addition, novel predictions will
emerge such as the appearance of exotic states with charges which are fractions of those of
ordinary quarks and leptons, a hidden world and a low energy u(1) symmetry.

3 the string model

in the four dimensional freefermionic formulation of the heterotic superstring, fermionic
degrees of freedom on the world sheet are introduced to cancel the conformal anomaly. the
rightmoving nonsupersymmetric sector in the lightcone gauge contains the two trans-
verse spacetime bosonic coordinates x  and 44 free fermions. the supersymmetric left
moving sector, in addition to the spacetime bosons x  and their fermionic superpartners
 includes also 18 real free fermions i, yi, i (i = 1, ..., 6) among which supersymmetry
is nonlinearly realized. the worldsheet supercurrent is

tf = x +xi

i yii

(19)

then, the theory is invariant under innitesimal superreparametrizations of the world
sheet as the conformal anomaly cancels separately in each sector. each worldsheet
fermion fi is allowed to pick up a phase fi(1, 1] under parallel transport around a
noncontractible loop of the worldsheet

a spin structure is then dened as a specic set of phases for all worldsheet fermions,

(21)

where r stands for real, c for complex and k + 2l = 64. for real fermions the phases f r
have to be integers while  is independent of the spacetime index .

the partition function is then dened as a sum over a set of spin structures ()

noncontractible circles of the torus and c(cid:16) 
(cid:17) a phase related to the gso projection. both
 and c(cid:16) 
(cid:17) are subject to string constraints which guarantee the consistency of the theory.
a string model in the context of free fermionic formulation of the fourdimensional
superstring is constructed by specifying a set of n basis vectors 1 (b0 = 1, b1, b2, . . . , bn1)
of the form (21) (which generate  = pi mibi) and a set of n(n1)
2 + 1 independent phases
c(cid:16) bi
bj(cid:17) . once a consistent set of basis vectors and a choice of projection coecients is

made, the gauge symmetry, the massless spectrum and the superpotential of the theory
are completely determined.
in particular, the massless states of a certain sector  =
(l; r)   are obtained by acting on the vacuum |0i with the bosonic and fermionic
mode operators. the massless states (m 2
r = 0) are found by the virassoro mass

all projections and includes the graviton, the dilaton and the twoindex antisymmetric

all worldsheet fermions appearing in the vectors of the above basis are assumed to have pe-
riodic boundary conditions. those not appearing in each vector are taken with antiperiodic
ones. we follow the standard notation used in references [3, 5]. thus, , 1...6, (y/)1...6 are
real left, (y/)1...6 are real right, and 1...5123 1...8 are complex right world sheet fermions.
in the above, 1 = b1 + b2 + b3 +  and the basis element s plays the role of the supersym-
metry generator as it includes exactly eight left movers. further, b1,2,3 elements reduce the
n = 4 supersymmetries into n = 1, while the initial o(44) symmetry of the rightmoving
sector results to an observable so(10)  so(6) gauge group at this stage. the so(10)
part corresponds to the ve 1...5 complex world sheet fermions while all chiral families at
this stage belong to the 16 representation of the so(10). vectors b4,5 reduce further the
symmetry of the left moving sector, while the introduction of the vector b6 deals with the
hidden part of the symmetry. finally, the choice of the vector  determines the nal gauge
symmetry (observable and hidden sector) of the model which is

su(4)  o(4)  u(1)4  {u(1)  su(8)}hidden.

(28)

the observable gauge group consists of the nonabelian so(6)  o(4) symmetry which
is isomorphic to the leftright patisalam symmetry [8]. there are also four u(1)i=1,...,4
factors related to 1,2,3-complex and the 24-real pair of worldsheet fermions of the right
moving sector. all the superelds of the observable sector carry nonzero charges under
these four u(1) symmetries. therefore, the latter are expected to play a very important
role in the determination of the yukawa couplings, the fermion mass textures, r-parity
violation and in general in all types of yukawa interactions of the model. we note here
that the observable elds do not carry charges under u(1).

the abelian part of the group deserves a separate treatment since this class of models
in general possess u(1) symmetries which are anomalous.
indeed, while we nd two of
the u(1) factors to be traceless tru(1)1 = tru(1) = 0, the other three are traceful, with
tru(1)2 = tru(1)3 = tru(1)4 = 24. however, the u(1) charges can be dened in such a
way that only one combination is anomalous. indeed, the linear combination

u(1)a = u(1)2 + u(1)3 + u(1)4,

(29)

has tr u (1)a = 72, while there are other three combinations orthogonal to the one above,
which are free of gauge and gravitational anomalies. these are,

u(1)1 = u(1)1
u(1)2 = u(1)2  u(1)3
u(1)2 = u(1)2 + u(1)3  2u(1)4.

(30)

the choice of the projection coecients shown in (27) has led to the desired three
generation model as well as some renements of the previously proposed theory [5] which
are phenomenologically appealing and deserve some discussion. the most important are,
the new yukawa couplings which give fermions masses, the mirror symmetry of the massless
spectrum and the number of su(4) higgs multiplets.

we start with the enumeration of representations candidates for families and su(4) 
su(2)r breaking higgs elds as they appear in appendix a. we rst note that due to
the presence of the various u(1)-factors, there is an arbitrariness in the embedding of the
electromagnetic charge operator. we will discuss this in detail in the end of this section,
however, to start with, we assume rst the simplest case where u(1)em is dened in the
standard way, (as in the original pssymmetry), i.e:

y =

1
6

t4 +

1
2

tl +

1
2

tr

(31)

where t6, tl, tr are the diagonal su(4), su(2)l and su(2)r generators respectively. then,
the massless spectrum is classied with respect to its group properties as follows:

 there are three copies of [(4, 2, 1) + (4, 1, 2)] representations, available to accommo-

date the three generations.

 there is one [(4, 1, 2) + (4, 1, 2)] pair which is interpreted as the higgs pair triggering

the su(4)  su(2)r breaking.

10

 one pair [(4, 2, 1) + (4, 2, 1)], (mirror to each other) replaces the second higgs pair
of the old string version [5]. clearly, since there are no mirror families observed in
the light spectrum, they should decouple at some high scale by forming a heavy mass
state.

 there are a large number of singlet elds with zero electric charge, while carrying
in the determination of the at
quantum numbers under the four u(1) factors.
directions of the model, their vevs have to be chosen in such a way so as to cancel the
dterm. these singlets couple to ordinary matter via superpotential terms. when
they develop vevs along certain at directions they may create a hierarchical fermion
mass spectrum through nonrenormalizable couplings.

 there are eight hidden su(8)-octet and octetbar superelds (charged under the
u(1)4  u(1)), which are also neutral under the usual charge denition. they can
also acquire nonzero vevs leading to additional mass terms for ordinary or exotic
matter elds.

 the exotic states of the model fall into two categories:
i) there are two su(4) fourplets h4 = (4, 1, 1), h4 = (4, 1, 1). after the symmetry
breaking, they result to a 3 and 3 pair with charges  1
6 respectively and two singlets
with charges  1
2.
ii) the second kind of exotic elds includes ten lefthanded doublets xil and an
equal number of righthanded ones xir with charges  1
2. the presence of exotic
particles in the massless spectrum of the theory is a generic feature of level k = 1
string constructions. such states in general, are regarded as string models achilles
heel since it is likely that they remain in the light spectrum down to the electroweak
scale. there are mainly three solutions to this problem : rst, one may choose a
suitable at direction where all of them become massive at a relatively large scale; as
a second possibility, one can properly modify the string boundary conditions on the
basis vectors, so that these states appear with nontrivial transformation properties
under a hidden nonabelian group. in this latter case the exotic states are conned at
the scale where the gauge coupling of the hidden group becomes strong [15]. clearly,
for a given number of matter representations, the higher the rank of the group, the
larger the connement scale. as a third possibility, one may consider the modication
of the charge operator (31) by the inclusion of additional u(1) factors. in the present
construction, we will discuss in some detail the last two possibilities. later, we will
give a brief account for their possible relevance on recent cosmological observations.

let us point out here that the observable spectrum of the model respects the symmetry
discussed in section 2 with respect to the simultaneous interchanges 2l  2r and 4  4.
in particular, left handed generation superelds are interchanged with right handed ones,
while there is a similar change of roles of the su(4) higgs and mirrors. we will also see in
the following sections that the treelevel and higher order yukawa interactions remain also
unaltered under the above interchanges. the above symmetry is broken however, by the
vacuum when consistent f  and datness solutions are found. we will discuss this when

11

the superpotential of the theory is presented and the corresponding atness conditions are
derived in the next sections.

4 symmetry breaking and hypercharge embedding in

the string model.

we will discuss now two related issues, the gauge symmetry breaking pattern and the
various consistent embeddings of the weak hypercharge. after dening the consistent set
of boundary conditions (26) described previously, one is left with an eective theory based
on the symmetry (28) with the following general characteristics. there is an eective
unication scale, namely the string scale mstring, where all couplings  up to threshold
corrections  attain a common value. at this point one is left with an eective n = 1

supergravity theory while the gauge group structure is of the form g = qn gn, containing

an observable and a hidden part. the two worlds are not completely decoupled. hidden
and observable elds are charged under ve abelian factors. the rst symmetry breaking
occurs when some of the singlet elds acquire vevs to cancel the dterm. depending of
the choice of the singlet vevs several (at most four) of the above u(1)s break, the natural
breaking scale ma being of the order of the dterm, i.e,

ma  q

= s t rqa

192

gstring



mp l =

3
2

gstringmp l

(32)

where t rqa = 72 is the trace of the anomalous u(1)a and mp l  4.2  1018gev is the
reduced planck mass. we note here that, if only the singlets were allowed to obtain a non
vanishing vev, at most four of the u(1)s break; no singlet is charged under the abelian
symmetry u(1) which remains unbroken at this stage. the observable part su(4) 
su(2)l  su(2)r has a rank larger than that of the mssm symmetry, which breaks
down to the smgauge group at an intermediate scale mgu t , usually some two orders of
magnitude below the string scale. the breaking occurs in the way described in section
2. the necessity of the su(4)  su(2)r symmetry breaking together with the d and
f atness conditions require at least two of the u(1) factors to break at a high scale.

there is nally the hidden su(8) part. this symmetry stays intact, as long as the 8
and 8 elds do not acquire vevs. note also that the octets are charged under u(1). in
many at directions which will be discussed subsequently, phenomenological requirements
force some of the octets to obtain vevs and the symmetry su(8)u(1) breaks to a smaller
one. now, a crucial observation (see the relevant table in the appendix a) is that all 8s
come with u(1) positive charge (+1) whilst all 8s appear with the opposite (1) charge.
it is easy to show then, that, no matter how many of the available octet elds receive a
nonzero vev, there is always a u(1) unbroken which is a linear combination of the u(1)
and one of the generators of the su(8). therefore, the hidden matter conserves a new
u(1) symmetry which stays unbroken down to low energies. its cosmological implications
will be discussed in a subsequent section.

table 1: the values of the weak mixing angle at the unication scale, for two denitions
of the weak hypercharge. in the second case, an additional u(1)-factor is assumed.

we turn now our discussion to the hypercharge embedding. as mentioned above, due
to the appearance of extra u(1)factors, the hypercharge generator is not uniquely de-
termined.
it can be any linear combination of the u(1)bl the ve available u(1)s of
the model and possible unbroken generators of the hidden gauge symmetry, provided the
minimal supersymmetric low energy particle spectrum is generated. the standard weak
hypercharge assignment  as this is dened in the original pssymmetry  does not in-
volve any of the surplus u(1) factors discussed above. it is solely determined in the usual
sense from the diagonal generators of the pssymmetry as in (31). under this denition
in addition to the representations accommodating the mssmelds, the states found in
(4, 1, 1) + (4, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 2) + (1, 2, 1) representations obtain the exotic charges dis-
cussed above, while they are rather unusual in the grand unied models.

we will discuss here in some detail another possible denition of the hypercharge oper-

ator which is obtained by including the u(1)-generator:

y  =

1

t4 +

2

tl +

1

tr 


2

q

(33)

where q is related to the u(1) charge of the particular massless state and  is the appro-
priate normalization constant. choosing for example  = 1, all extra doublets xl,r obtain
integral charges (1, 0). on the other hand, this new embedding leads to the normalization
of the hypercharge generator

k =

5 + 122

3

.

(34)

1+k .

the value of the weak mixing angle at mstring is sin2 w (mstring) = 1
its values for
the two lower s are given in table 1. for  = 0, we obtain the standard gut sin2 w
prediction but the exotic states have fractional charges, whereas for  = 1 the xl,r doublets
as well as the (4, 1, 1) and (4, 1, 1) representations, obtain charges like those of the ordinary
down quarks and leptons. it should not escape our attention that in this new hypercharge
denition y  the octet elds now appear with fractional charges 1/2. this is not however
a real problem. the coupling of the su(8) group becomes strong at a high scale, leading
to a connement (in close analogy with qcd), and forcing the octets to form bound
states with the corresponding octetbar elds. we should note here that this situation
opens up the possibility of giving vevs to these condensates at a smaller scale and create
new mass terms for the ordinary matter through their superpotential couplings. the new
hypercharge denition predicts a low value for the weak mixing angle which is essentially
the value obtained in a kacmoody level k = 2 string construction [9]. starting however,

13

from such a small initial value for sin2 w at mstring, there is no obvious way how the larger
low energy value can be obtained in this case.

let us close this section with a short comment on one more possibility of symmetry
breaking. one can give vevs directly to the exotic su(2)r-doublet elds xir.
(both
their components are charged (qem = 1/2) under the standard hypercharge assignment
(31)). the vev should be taken along the neutral direction dened by the proper linear
combination. this will essentially lead to a denition of the hypercharge as in the case of
 = 1. however, this approach has the advantage that the small initial value of sin2 w is
dened now at the su(2)r-breaking scale which can be taken to be much lower that the
string scale. this case requires a separate treatment since there are new elds entering the
atness conditions while new mass terms appear in the superpotential. moreover, exotic
doublets now look like the ordinary electron doublets while far reaching phenomenological
implications appear.

5 the superpotential of the string version.

we proceed now to the calculation of the perturbative superpotential. clearly, the number
of elds in the string version is signicantly larger than those of its surrogate gut discussed
in section 2. in fact, in the model of section 2, the construction of the superpotential was
rather easy since only gauge symmetries had to be respected. here, however, not all gauge
invariant terms are allowed; additional restrictions from worldsheet symmetries have to be
taken into account since they eliminate a large portion of the gauge invariant superpotential
terms. a short description of the calculation [16, 17] of the renormalizable as well as the
nonrenormalizable superpotential terms is given in the appendix b.

where in each terms an o(1)g/mp l multiplicative factor. higher order terms up to sixth
order have been also calculated and are presented in the appendix b.

having obtained the spectrum of the model, as well as the available superpotential
terms, we need to determine the vacuum of our theory, by making an appropriate choice
of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs elds (fourplets, bidoublets and a sucient
number of singlets) and possibly some of the hidden su(8) multiplets. all these choices
should be consistent with the d and f atness conditions. a complete account of all
possible solutions of these conditions will be given subsequently, however, not all of those
solutions are satisfactory from the phenomenological point of view. a nal conclusion
about the viability of a certain at direction however cannot be drawn before adequately
high order nrterms are taken into account. there are two main reasons for this: rst, it is
possible that a particular viable at direction at a certain order, is destroyed when higher
order nrterms are included in the calculation. second, even if a phenomenologically
promising at direction can be proven to persist at higher orders, it is possible that the new
nr superpotential terms create undesired mass terms. for example, a usual phenomenon
is that they ll in many entries in the higgs mass matrix, so it is possible that there is
no massless higgs left to break the symmetry. as a consequence, one may have further
constraints on the particular at direction by forcing some additional elds to obtain a
zero vev. this will be discussed in a subsequent section.

from the above remarks, it is evident that the right choice of the vacuum of the model is
not an easy task. in the next section our endeavor will be concentrated in the classication
of all at directions and their relevance to the low energy phenomenological expectations.
it is useful therefore, in order to pin down the few promising vacua from the hundreds
of available solutions, to summarize the basic observations which will help us to complete
this task. this will enable us to determine the right at direction and choose those singlet
(and possibly hidden) eld vevs that guarantee a successful description of the low energy
phenomenological theory.

 we start with the higgs mechanism; we rst observe that there is only one pair
of higgs elds available to break su(4) symmetry, namely the fourplet f4r and

15

in general one linear combination of the elds f1,2,3,5. thus, in order to keep f4r
massless and prevent a mass term through the treelevel coupling f4r f5r 3, we need
to impose h3i = 0.

 in addition to the three generations expected to appear at low energies, the model
predicts also the existence of one additional (4, 2, 1) representation plus its mirror
f5l = (4, 2, 1). since no mirror families appear in the low energy spectrum, we need a
mass term of the form hiifil f5l (where i some of the singlets with nonzero vevs)
to give a heavy mass to the mirror f5l. a candidate term could be 2 f5lf4l which
exists already at the treelevel. at fourth order there is also the term f5lf3lz3 z5.
thus, up to fourth order, we obtain

xi hiifil f5l = (2f4l + f3lz3 z4 +   ) f5l

(37)

where {  } stand for possible higher order nrterms involving elds that may ac-
quire vevs. clearly, if we wish to make the mirror multiplets heavy with superpo-
tential terms up to fourth order, we should demand from atness conditions either
2 6= 0, or z3 z5 6= 0. solutions with higher order nrterms are also possible as it
will be clear later.

 a number of sextet elds, di, i = 1, ..., 4 containing colour triplets as well as triplets
surviving the higgs mechanism appear also in the spectrum. in order to avoid possible
proton decay problems we need also mass terms for those coloured elds. as far as
the sextet elds are concerned, the sextet matrix at treelevel is

d1d212 + d1d412 + d2d3

12 + d3d4 12

their eigenmasses in terms of the scalar components of the singlet elds are

with

(38)

(39)

(40)

the above eigenvalues are all nonzero whenever the condition

12 12  12

12 6= 0

is fullled. therefore, a satisfactory at direction should keep the appropriate singlets
with nonzero vevs. it will be clear later that in most of the phenomenologically viable
string vacua, higher order nrcontributions will prove necessary to make all sextet
elds massive.

in forming the mass matrices for triplets, we should also take into account the fact
that there are also coloured triplets in the higgs pair (4, 1, 2) + (4, 1, 2). thus,

16

recalling in mind the sextet decomposition d4  d3
a heavy mass to dc

4 and the terms

4rd3

4 + d3

4, the term f4rf4rd4 gives

f5r f5rd2 + f2r f2rd2 + f1r f1rd1

make another 3  3 combination massive. this linear combination depends on the
choice of the elds which are going to accommodate the families and higgses. this
will be precisely determined as long as a specic at direction is chosen.

 there is a new interesting feature of this version; there are two candidate terms at

fourth order to provide masses to the second generation

f1rf1lh41 + f2rf2lh4 4

(41)

they are expected to be of the right order, provided that at least one of the singlets
1, 4 gets a nonzero vev.

after this preliminary analysis, we are ready now to explore other important aspects of
the model. in the next section we will nd all treelevel and higher order solutions to the
atness conditions which determine the consistent string vacua.

6 the solutions of the f and datness conditions

one of the main concerns in constructing eective supersymmetric models from super-
strings, is to nd the at directions along which the scalar potential vanishes. string
models in general contain several at directions which are lifted by higher order corrections
to the superpotential and supersymmetry breaking eects. the latter set also the scale of
the scalar potential. another interesting fact in string model building concerning these at
directions, is the existence of a dterm contribution [18, 19]. as has been discussed in the
previous section, there is a linear combination of the four surplus u(1) factors accompa-
nying the observable gauge group of the model, which remains anomalous. the standard
anomaly cancellation mechanism [19] results to a shift of the vacuum where several scalar
components of the singlet (and possibly hidden) superelds develop nonzero vevs. their
magnitude is determined by the solution(s) of the complete system of the f - and d-atness
constraints.

derivation of the atness constraints

the f -atness equations are easily derived from the superpotential. they are the set of
equations resulting from the dierentiation of w with respect to the elds of the massless
spectrum fi,


fiw = 0

in this paper we will mainly concentrate on an analysis of the atness conditions involving
elds only from the observable sector. for completeness, we also give in the appendix b

17

the relevant contributions to the atness conditions taking into account hidden eld vevs
as well as higher order corrections from nrterms.

on the left of the above equations we show the eld with respect to which the superpotential
is dierentiated . in equations (59,62) both su(2)l and su(2)r fourplet elds have been
included to exhibit the invariance of the equations under a straightforward generalization
of the transformations (19). indeed, it can be observed now that the f atness equations
as well as the yukawa interactions remain unaltered under the interchanges mentioned in
previous sections. in particular, when 4 and 2r are interchanged with 4 and 2l respectively,
it can be seen that the superpotential remains invariant under the following renaming of
the elds

f5, f5  f4, f4 f1, f1  f2, f2 d1, d3  d2, d4

this symmetry is also preserved by higher order yukawa terms as can be easily checked
from the terms presented in the appendix. nevertheless, the dequations are not invariant.
clearly, any solution of them denes a vacuum which does not preserve the symmetry.
in the subsequent, we make a denite choice with regard to this symmetry putting all
hfili = 0.

the datness equations for anomalous or nonanomalous u(1) factors with hidden
eld contributions are also derived in the appendix c. in the absence of nonzero hidden
eld vevs, they can be written in the following compact form

tree and higher level solutions of f  and datness constraints

a consistent phenomenological analysis of the model requires a complete knowledge
of all vacua, therefore, a systematic approach to classify all d and f at directions is
needed. when this is done, we will be able to know which elds acquire nonzero vevs in
any specic at direction2. these vevs will determine completely the masses of fermion
and scalar elds through their superpotential couplings.

in the remaining of this section we present a systematic analysis of the above constraints,
taking into account basic phenomenological requirements. this will limit considerably the
number of possible solutions. thus, for example, as already has been pointed out, it is
necessary to impose the constraint h3i = 0, in order to prevent a mass term for the
higgs eld f4r at treelevel. this, by no means ensures the existence of a consistent
solution. we postpone the complete presentation after we obtain the set of mathematically
consistent cases. in the present paper we restrict the analysis of the atness conditions in
the case where only observable elds acquire nonzero vevs. solutions with hidden eld
vevs are much more involved and may result to interesting new vacua. although a detailed
investigation of the latter will not considered here, a brief discussion of their role is given
later in this paper.

2for similar systematic analyzes in other models, see [20, 21, 22, 23].

we nd it convenient to start our analysis from the f atness conditions (44,45) which

imply four distinct cases:

1 = 1 = 0 , 4 6= 0;

(i)
(iii) 4 = 1 = 0;

(ii) 1 = 4 = 0;
(iv) 4 = 1 = 0 , 1, 4 6= 0 .

from the above cases, only (iii, iv) have consistent solutions. lets rst explain why cases
(i) and (ii) are rejected.

cases (i) and (ii)

from eqs. (55,56) we deduce 2 = 0, while 4 6= 0 in eq. (50) imposes 12 = 0. this
however leads to inconsistency with equation d4, since the left side of the equation is
negative while the right side is positive and nonzero. similarly case (ii) where 1 = 4 = 0,
is not soluble as can be easily seen from the equation (d3)+(d1). we consider the two
remaining cases (iii) and (iv)separately.

case (iii)

from eq. (50), we nd 2 = 0. further, d4atness tells us that 1 and 12 cannot be
simultaneously zero. then, combining this with conditions (54) and (55) we conclude that

12 = 0, 4 = 4 = 0, 1 6= 0, 2 = 0

(76)

while 1  12 = 0.

proceeding further, we classify all solutions in this case according to their number of free
parameters and elds with zero vevs. at the treelevel, there are 17 solutions consistent
with the f  and datness conditions. these are cases 117 of table 9 of the appendix d.
several of these at directions are lifted when higher order nrterms are included. on the
other hand, other treelevel at directions remain at when additional constraints have are
imposed on the eld vevs. there are cases where a single treelevel at direction results to
more than one distinct cases at a higher level since the solution of the constraints may be
satised for various choices of eld vevs.

when nr contributions to atness conditions up 6th order are taken into account, the
above treelevel solutions reduce to the rst thirteen cases presented in table 2. the rst
column numbers the solutions, while the last one denotes the number of free (complex)
parameters left. the ve columns in the middle show the elds with zero vevs, where for
presentation purposes abbreviations in the eld notation have been used. thus, in the
second row, the numbers 12, 12, 12, 12, denote the elds 12, 12,12, 
12, and so on.
the elds which are forced to obtain zero vevs due to higher order nrcontributions in the
yukawa potential, are included in curly brackets. thus, for example, in the fourth column
of the rst case, the symbol {2} means that h 2i has a zero vev due to the inclusion of nr
terms. further, for the same reason in the fth column we also use the notation {1},{2}
which should be translated to the conditions f1r = f2r = 0 imposed by nrterms. in
this notation, one can see the eect of nrterms in the treelevel solutions presented in
appendix d. for example, the rst solution in table 9 (in the appendix) results to the rst
two distinct cases of table 2 and so on.

note that in table 2 we present only the vanishing vevs of each particular solution.
substitution in the f  and datness conditions, results to a number of constraints char-

20

acterizing each solution. these constraints are not presented in table 2 but they have
been taken into account in the calculation of free parameters. specic examples will be
presented later in section 7. due to the existence of free parameters, each solution of table
2 can in principle generate a number of phenomenologically distinct cases. we will see
in a subsequent section how some of these free parameters are forced to obtain zero vevs
following the requirements of low energy phenomenology.

case (iv)

in a similar manner, we proceed also in this case where 1 = 4 = 0. eqs. (50), (54) lead
to two subcases depending on whether 2 is zero or not.

 (iv )a when 2 = 0, the analysis proceeds in analogy with case (iii). thus, we nd

eight solutions at the treelevel which cases 18-25 of table 9.

 (ivb) for the case 2 6= 0, a tedious analysis leads to the unique treelevel solution
(77)

2,3 = i = i = i = f3r = f5r = 0

with 2 = 4 12 12 6= 0

this is also included as case 26 in the complete list of the treelevel solutions of table 9
in appendix d. when nrcontributions are taken into account various at directions are
lifted and the total number of solutions is reduced to 4 which are shown in table 2 (cases
(14)-(17)).

having obtained all consistent solutions, let us try to apply the preliminary phenomeno-
logical discussion of the previous section. we rst point out that in eight of the cases above,
all four 12s elds in the second row have zero vevs. although nothing can be denitely
said until a complete analysis with higher nrterms is done, we consider them as less
favored since they leave all four sextet elds massless at treelevel. another two solutions
on the other hand, has all i = i = 0. again, according to our previous analysis, it
would be desirable to obtain a mass term for the second generation at fourth order where
a natural fermion mass hierarchy is obtained. such a solution should admit at least 1 6= 0
and h f1ri = 0, or 4 6= 0 and h f2ri = 0. from this point of view, the cases admitting
nonzero vevs for some of the i, i are more preferable. few of them leave only the fourplet
f1r 6= 0 to be interpreted as the second su(4)  su(2)r breaking higgs, (the other being
denitely f4r), while there are several cases with h f3ri 6= 0. moreover, since in most of
the cases h f5ri = 0, this latter eld together with f4l, are suitable to accommodate the
third generation fermions who may receive a treelevel mass term via the yukawa coupling
f5rf4lh4.

7 higgs elds and fermion mass textures

we start our phenomenological analysis of the string model with the discussion on the higgs
sector. clearly, all the consistent solutions of the at directions considered in the previous

up to sixth order. the elds appearing in the table have zero vevs. those appearing in
curly brackets {} are forced to have zero vevs form nrcontributions, while those in square

section automatically ensure the existence of one higgs pair in (4, 1, 2) + (4, 1, 2) to break
the su(4) su(2)r symmetry. our next task is the securing of a massless pair of su(2)l
higgs doublets in order to break the electroweak symmetry. it suces the existence of only
one massless higgs bidoublet (1, 2, 2), since after the rst stage of symmetry breaking two
electroweak doublets with the correct quantum numbers arise

no further contributions to the higgs matrix exist up to sixth order. we will explore the
eigenvalues of the above matrix in conjunction with the atness solutions discussed in the
previous section.
in order to have at least one zero eigenvalue, the determinant of mh
should be zero

det(mh) = (1 1  4 4)2 = 0

(80)

we notice that the determinant of the higgs matrix does not depend on the elds vevs
12, 12 and 2.

we now come to the particular at directions of table 2. we observe that 13 solutions
arising from cases (iii), (iv) have automatically 1 = 4 = 0. in the remaining 4 solutions
the additional constraint 1 = 0 has to be imposed in order to ensure the existence of at
least one massless higgs doublet. these are the cases (5,6,10,11) where the symbol [1] in
the third column is used to declare the higgs matrix constraint on the singlet vev 1.

by inspection of the datness equations (68)-(72) we infer that two pairs of bidoublets
are always massive. going to specic cases we nd that the higgs matrix in solutions (1-
13) has exactly two zero eigenvalues corresponding to the pure states h2, h4, while rest are
massive. solutions (14-16) have two massless bidoublets. these are h2 and the combination
h  4h3 + 1h4 the remaining solution (17) has only one massless bidoublet and more
particularly h2.

each one of the above cases leads to a distinct phenomenological model. it is convenient
to classify them with respect to the (4, 1, 2) multiplet available for the higgs mechanism.

 there are seven cases, namely (1,3,5,6,8,10,11), where the only available eld of this

type is f3r since, as can be seen from the table, h f(1,2,5)ri = 0.

 in one single case (7) the (4, 1, 2)higgs in general can be a linear combination of

f2r, f5r

 only three solutions admit h f1ri 6= 0. these are (9,13,17).

23

 there are three solutions where the higgs may be a linear combination of f(2,3)r

(14,15) or f(2,3,5)r, su(4) (16) multiplets.

 finally, solutions (2,4,12) admit only h f2ri 6= 0.
let us emphasize at this point that the above distinction between the solutions together
with the massless electroweak higgs eld classication, is in accordance with common phe-
nomenological characteristics. for example, solutions of the rst kind above which impose
h f3ri 6= 0, have a rather larger number of yukawa couplings available for fermion mass
generation, making them more appealing. also, from a further inspection of the superpo-
tential terms, the second class of solutions with h f5ri 6= 0 implies a mass for the hu
4 higgs
via the treelevel term h f5rif4lh4. this fact leaves only one yukawa coupling available for
the up quarks, up to fth order making these solutions less interesting. in what follows,
we will work out in some detail some representative cases from table 2.

case 1:

let us start with the rst solution in table 2. along this at direction, the following 15
elds are required to have zero vevs

12 = 12 = 12 = 2,4,5 = 4 = 1,2,4 = 3 = 3 = f1,2,5 = 0 .

(81)

among them, 2 and f5r are constrained to have zero vevs from sixth order contributions.
substituting the above condition to the full system of d and f  atness equations we
obtain a reduced system of 9 equations for the remaining elds. these are

taking into account that the total number of elds available to obtain vevs are 30 (assuming
that hidden sector elds do not develop vevs), we end to a 6 parameter solution. this is the
number of free parameters (f.p.) presented in the last column of table 2. as seen from the
above equations consistency of the solution requires a minimum number of the remaining
15 elds

f3r, f4r, 1,3, 1,2,3, 1,2,3, 1,2,4, 1,2,4, 12 6= 0

(91)

24

to be nonzero. these are 1 , 3 , f3r , f4r and at least one of 1, 2, 4. the f4r and
f3r vevs are not imposed by atness but are required in order to obtain su(4)  su(2)r
breaking. thus the higgses in this case, in the notation of section 2, are

f3r  h(4, 1, 2)

f4r  h(4, 1, 2);

(92)
to explore the hierarchy of the fermion mass spectrum, we note rst that since h f3ri 6= 0,
the treelevel yukawa coupling f3rf3lh2 cannot be used for a fermion mass term. clearly,
f3l is more appropriate for a mirror partner for f5l. therefore f5r and f4l are suitable to
accommodate a family and more particularly the heaviest one as indicated by the treelevel
superpotential term f5rf4lh4. in this case we need to impose h2i = 0, to avoid a mass
term of the form h2if4l f5l.
then, condition (85) results to two distinct cases, either h4i = 0, or h2i = 0, each of
them leading to a dierent phenomenological model. although at this level of calculation
it cannot be decided which of the two cases is appropriate, we consider the case h4i 6= 0
as more favorable since it gives a treelevel mass term to a pair of exotic states. thus we
choose to explore the case h2i = 0.

to determine further the low energy parameters, we investigate the su(4) breaking
scale constraints as well as the singlet vevs entering the mass operators. from (88),(89) it
follows that the su(4) breaking scale has a well dened upper limit, determined exclusively
from the d-term

| f3r|  s 

3

mp l

(93)

for perturbative values of gstring (93) gives a bound around the mass scale 1017gev. further,
from (87) we also conclude that |1| < |4|. up to fth order, we nd the following yukawa
couplings suitable for charged fermion masses

f5rf4lh4 +

h4i
mp l

f2rf2lh4 + h1i
mp l

f1rf1lh4

(94)

the last two terms appear at the fourth order, thus an additional mass parameter in their
denominators appears. (in the appendix b the mass parameters in the denominators are
omitted in order to simplify the notation.) these two terms are obviously hierarchically
smaller than the rst term which gives masses to the third generation; further, taking
into account the atness constraints, we infer that the second and rst generations are
accommodated in f2r, f2l and f1r, f1l respectively. from the constraints above, we are
able to choose 1  4, so that we satisfy the mass hierarchies. moreover, this implies
that f3r  4. recalling that f3r plays the role of the su(4)breaking higgs at the scale
mgu t , we nd that the topcharm relation will determine further these vevs to be of the
order

mgu t

mp l  h f3ri

mp l 

m0
c

(95)

it is worth noticing that this relation which correlates the su(4) breaking scale with that
of the scale m  mp l through the charmtop ratio at mstring, is in excellent agreement

25

with both, the atness condition (93) as well as the unication scale of the minimal uni-
cation scenario. we thus conclude that in the at direction under consideration the avor
assignments of the light standard model quarks and lepton elds are as follows

f1l : (u, d), (e, e) ;
f2l : (c, s), (, ) ;
f4l : (t, b), (,  ) ;

f1r : uc, dc, ec, c
e
f2r : cc, sc, c, c

f5r : tc, bc,  c, c


(96)

up to now, we have a rather successful picture of the fermion mass spectrum which is
also in agreement with the string constraints. the above accommodation of the fermion
generations and higgs elds leaves no arbitrariness as far as the extra vectorlike states are
concerned: these are f3l and f5l. the only mass term available at treelevel using elds
of the observable sector, is proportional to the singlet vev h2i however this is zero in the
present case. nevertheless, we observe that there are terms involving hidden elds which
may acquire nonzero vevs and give a heavy mass to the mirror particles. for example,
this can be obtained with a nonzero vev of the combination hz3 z4i 6= 0 while they are
constrained by the datness to have equal vevs |hz3i| = |h z4i| 3.

we turn now to the neutrino sector. the three terms in (94) imply also dirac masses
for the corresponding neutrinos with initial conditions at mstring being the same as those
for the upquarks. therefore a seesaw mechanism is necessary to bring them down to
experimentally acceptable scales. an available term exists already in the treelevel su-
5r with the singlet eld 3
perpotential, which couples the right handed neutrino c
via the vev hf4ri. this leads to a seesaw mechanism of the type discussed in section
2. if we wish to nd a nal solution within the observable sector eld vevs, however, a
complete account of the neutrino mass problem needs the calculation of even higher non
renormalizable terms. restricting ourselves to contributions of nrterms up to fth order,
the seesaw mechanism, in principle, can be eective for all neutrino species only when
additional hidden elds acquire vevs. in this case it is easily checked that the following
additional terms are generated

5  f c

arising from the hidden sector nonrenormalizable contributions:

a = hf4rz4 z5i, b = hf4rz4 z2i, c = hf4rz2 z4i, d = hf4rz1 z4i.

(97)

(98)

the terms (97) complete the mechanism for all three avours of neutrinos and lead to an
extended seesaw of the type (11). we note however that the inclusion of the above hidden
vevs requires a reexamination of the atness conditions.

we come now to the elds having fractional charges. since no 1/2-charge particle
has been observed, the doublet states xl,r should also receive masses at some point,
presumably higher than the electroweak scale. if we write the doublet xir = (+
i , i ),

3a similar mechanism has also been used in the ippedsu (5) case [21]

26

then a possible mass term would be of the form:

wx = hiabx a
= hi(+

irx b
jr
i j  i +
j )

(99)

where ab is the su(2) antisymmetric tensor.  can be any combination of elds acquiring
vevs resulting to an eective singlet along the neutral direction. a similar term can also
exist for the left doublets xl. terms mixing left with right doublets are also possible,
however, they lead to masses of the order of the electroweak scale and are not of interest
here. at the treelevel, in the present at direction we have the following mass terms

w 3

x = h4ix2rx5r + h2ix2rx6r + h1ix1rx6r

(100)

and similarly there are two terms for the left doublet elds. notice that we have now
made used of the nonzero vev h4i 6= 0 which, according to the atness conditions (85)
implies h2i = 0. there are still three and four pairs of right and left doublets respectively
needed to take masses at some scale well above mw . all possible terms up to fth order,
have been collected in appendix b. by an inspection of the relevant (to this at direction)
terms up to this order, it follows that few of the octet elds zi, zi of the hidden sector with
nonzero vevs, are adequate to make all of them massive. as has already been pointed
out, however, this will require a reexamination of the atness conditions [24]. all the
same, the observable singlet vevs may prove to be sucient if higher order contributions
are calculated. a similar term may also appear for the two su(4) fourplets h4 = (4, 1, 1),
h4 = (4, 1, 1).

there is nally the rather important issue concerning the triplet elds related to the
stability of the proton. recall rst from the detailed analysis in section 2 that the triplets
live only in the sextets and the fourplet higgs elds. there are two types of terms here
to render them massive. in the present case, there is only one mass term available for the
sextet elds at three level, namely 12d3d4, while the terms f 2
4rd4 oer
additional couplings with the uneaten higgs triplet of f4r. thus, up to fth order, three
triplet pairs remain light. higher order nrterms will make them massive. in particular,
an inspection of the related seventh order nonrenormalizable superpotential mass terms
shows that there are plenty of available couplings rendering all but one pair massive

4rd3 and  2

it can be checked that the only coloured eld which remained uncoupled is the triplet dc
3 of
the higgs eld h  f3r leading to a pair of massless triplets. this has to do with the fact
that elds arising from the second b3 and being charged under peculiar u(1)4 factor make
only few nonzero yukawa couplings with other elds. for the same reason, quarks and
lepton elds do not also have dangerous couplings with this triplet eld up to this order.
at higher orders, singlet elds with nonzero u(1)4 charge are expected to form nrterm
mass terms for dc

3 and its partner so that proton decay could be avoided.

27

case 7

here we have the following zero vevs

12, 12, 2,5, 4, 1,4, 3, 1,3, f1r, f3r = 0

(102)

following the steps of the analysis of the previous case we nd that atness reduces to 10
equations and thus the number of free parameters is 7. the su(4)breaking higgs elds
are f4r and a linear combination of the fourplets f2r and f5r. we now restrict to use the
case h f2ri = 0. thus, the higgses are

(103)
since h2i 6= 0, the trilinear term f5lf4l2 makes massive the extra vectorlike states. on
the other hand the terms

f4r  h(4, 1, 2); f5r  h(4, 1, 2)

(104)
mix a combination of the higgs doublet in h4 with 5 in f5l leaving massless the combination

(105)

once we have determined the electroweak higgs eigenstates we are in a position to examine
the available fermion mass terms. as previously, we will analyze yukawa couplings up to
fth order. it is natural to accommodate the third generation in the representations arising
from the sector b3; due to the existing fermion hierarchy the heavy fermions are expected
to obtain their mass through the only available treelevel term

then the lighter generations receive masses from nonrenormalizable terms,

as can be seen from the massmatrix, observable sector contributions up to seventh order
make all but one pair of the coloured triplets massive. if hidden elds also acquire vevs
then all triplets could become massive.

case 13

we briey comment now on another characteristic case of table 2, namely solution (13).
this case is distinguished by two remarkable properties which are worth mentioning:
(i) first we observe that all coloured sextets become massive at treelevel. this can be
seen from the mass formula (39) and the fact that only one of the four singlets involved in
the treelevel mass matrix is required to have a zero vev (namely h12i = 0).
(ii) second, we point out that the two lighter generations are not pure states, since they
appear to mixing appears already at treelevel. to see this, we check rst from table 2
that the solution requires h f2,3,5i = 0, thus the su(4)  su(2)r higgs elds are now f4r
and f1r. a possible mass term for the mirror states may appear now at a higher order
(unless  as previously  hidden elds obtain nonzero vevs). the fermion mass terms are
in this case

f3rf3lhh2i + f5r(cid:16)f4lhh4i + f1lh2h f1rf4rh4(cid:17)i

(109)

clearly, the righthanded elds leaving in f5r mix with both f1l and f4l. the avor
assignments are now

f1l : (u, d), (e, e) ;
f2l : (c, s), (, ) ;
f3l : (t, b), (,  ) ;

f2r : uc, dc, ec, c
e
f2r : cc, sc, c, c

f3r : tc, bc,  c, c


(110)

where primes are used to denote that there is mixing in the two lighter generations. we
should point out here that the third family remains essentially decoupled due to the peculiar
properties of the fourth u(1). only very high order nrterms are possible to mix this family
with the lighter ones. this fact of course predicts smaller mixing angles between the third
family with the rest of the fermion spectrum in consistency with the phenomenological
expectations.

8 a brief discussion on the role of the hidden sector

elds

up to now, we dealt with solutions of the atness conditions considering only nonzero vevs
for observable elds. in the phenomenological analysis of the previous section, however,

29

we have seen that couplings involving only observablesector eld vevs are not adequate
to make all exotic particles massive. there are mainly two important issues to be further
investigated before this model is confronted with the low energy physics world. first, higher
order nrterms have to be calculated in order to nd all possible contributions to the mass
matrices of fermions, triplets and other elds presented in the previous section. on the
other hand, hidden elds can also play a very important role on the determination of the
true vacuum of the model. since they carry no charge, they can also develop nonzero vevs
and contribute to the masses of the light elds through their yukawa interactions. this
fact has been clear already in the three examples used in the previous section. neutrino
masses, exotic states, and few of the triplet elds become massive only when hidden elds
are included. at the same time, in both cases, the additional terms contribute also to
the atness conditions, thus the new nonzero vevs have to be carefully chosen so that
they dene a consistent f  and dat direction. for such an investigation, one has to
modify the atness solutions, starting again from the tree level cases which are included
in appendix d. a systematic analysis of this general case is possible, however, this goes
beyond the scope of the present work [24]. for completeness, the datness conditions, in
the presence of nonzero hidden eld vevs is given in appendix c. moreover, the fatness
conditions are written with the hidden elds contributions up to fourth order in the same
appendix. higher order nrcorrections with hidden as well as observable eld vevs are
easily extracted from the terms presented in appendix b. in the following, we give a brief
account of the possible solutions the hidden elds may give to some of the unanswered
questions of the present string construction.

several constraints have to be carefully derived before some of the hidden representa-
tions acquire vevs. an important constraint arises from the demand of existence of massless
electroweak higgs doublets. although up to sixth order we have found no extra contribu-
tions to the higgs doublet matrix, such terms may well exist in higher order, in particular
when hidden elds are allowed to obtain nonzero vevs. it should be noted that due to the
existence of high vevs associated with the u(1)a breaking scale ma  101mp l securing the
existence of massless electroweak doublets is not an easy task for any superstring model.
to be more specic, assume a generic form of doublet mass term

with  representing a typical singlet eld obtaining a vev of the order hi  ma. it is easy
to see then that even a n = 14 order nrterm would in principle produce higgs masses
above the electroweak scale. of course the existence of superuous doublet elds as is the
case of the model under consideration provides the hope that even at this high order of
calculation there exist at directions that preserve at least one pair of doublets massless.
another severe constraint arises from the necessity to keep the large su(4)  su(2)r
breaking higgs eld f4r massless. up to sixth order, this can be ensured if the following
combinations of vevs are zero

3,
2 z2z4,

z3z4,
2z1 z4,

2z4 z5,
1z1 z5,

30

33 z3z4, 13 z1z4, 11 z1z5.

(111)

one might think that the above constraints demand most of the hidden elds zi, zj to
obtain zero vevs. we would like to point out however that it is possible to have a condition
of the form hzi zji = 0, while at the same time both elds may have nonzero vevs, hzii 6= 0
and h zji 6= 0. this happens whenever the elds zi and zj obtain their nonzero vevs in
orthogonal to eachother directions.
when some of the su(8) hidden elds acquire nonzero vevs, the su(8)  u(1) sym-
metry is broken to a smaller group. however, independently of the number of the hidden
states which develop nonzero vevs, there is always at least one unbroken u(1) generator
left, which is in general a linear combination of the u(1) and one of the generators of
su(8). on the other hand, we note that the maximum number of u(1) factors which may
remain unbroken in this model is two. indeed, it can be checked that the breaking of the
su(4)  su(2)r symmetry on one hand and the consistency of the atness conditions on
the other require at least the elds f4r, f1r and 12, 1 to develop nonzero vevs. these
vevs break three of the ve abelian factors.

the survival of u(1) symmetries in lower energies would imply the stability of lightest
observable and/or hidden elds being charged under these symmetries. in all at directions
which were previously analyzed, when the various singlet elds obtain their vevs, they break
four out of ve u(1) factors. thus, only the aforementioned u(1) remains at low energies
whilst, as a consequence the lightest hidden state will be stable. this fact has important
cosmological implications which we now briey discuss:

the last few years there is accumulating evidence from astronomical observations that
the universe is dominated by invisible nonbaryonic matter. according to a recent proposal
[25, 26] the dark matter of the universe which is expected to be ten times more that the
luminous one might be composed from nonthermal superheavy states produced in the
early universe provided that the following two conditions are met: i) candidate particles y
should have a lifetime longer that the age of the universe, y  1010y, and ii) they should
not reach local thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma. to avoid this constraint
while having the correct number of y to form the cold dark matter of the universe, it was
suggested that these particles are created through the interaction of the vacuum with the
gravitational eld. their mass is found to be around my  1013gev 4.

in the string vacua found in the previous sections, a number of the hidden states zi, zi
in the present string construction receive masses at scales which are of the order of the
string mass. there are few of zi, zi states however, which remain in the massless spectrum
to lower scales. it is possible that in certain string vacua the lightest hidden state has a
mass in the range my  1013gev as required in the above scenario. as an example, we
construct here the octet mass matrix for the solution 1 of table 2. in the basis z1,...,5, the
contributions up to sixth order involving only the nonzero vev observable elds give the

in this case, four out of ve hidden octet/octetbar pairs receive masses of the order of the
u(1)a breaking mass scale ma  mgu t . if hidden elds are also allowed to obtain vevs,
then, z4,5 are further mixed via the mass terms h1z1 z1i z4z5 + h3z1 z1i z5z4. there is
only one massless state (namely z3) up to this order. it is expected that higher order terms
will provide a higher order nrcontribution and make the remaining lightest hidden pair
massive at the right scale, which is of course much lower that the mass scale ma of the
other zi-elds, as required by the above cosmological scenario.

9 conclusions

in this paper, we have worked out an su(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r model derived in the
context of the four dimensional free fermionic formulation of the heterotic superstring.
choosing a set of nine vectors of boundary conditions on the worldsheet fermion phases
and appropriate gso projection coecients, we derived a threegeneration model sup-
plemented by a mirror family and just the necessary higgs representations to break the
symmetry down to the standard model. in addition to the observable gauge symmetry, the
string model possesses also ve u(1)s as well as a hidden su(8) gauge group. the model
predicts the existence of new states beyond those of the minimal supersymmetric standard
model massless spectrum. these involve a large number of neutral singlet elds, coloured
su(4)sextets, su(8)-octet hidden elds and exotic states with fractional charges under
the standard hypercharge denition.

the superpotential of the model has been derived taken into account string selection
rules. all fermion mass terms have been worked out in detail up to fth order and the
fermion and higgs mass matrix textures have been assiduously analyzed. the model is
found to possess an anomalous u(1)-symmetry implying the generation of a dterm which
is canceled by vacuum expectation values of singlet elds along d and f at directions
of the superpotential.

to work out the phenomenological implications, we have performed a detailed analysis of
all d and f  at directions including contributions of nonrenormalizable superpotential
terms up to sixth order. at treelevel, 26 solutions to the atness conditions were found
and were classied with respect to the elds which are demanded to have zero vevs in
each particular case. it was further shown that, when sixth order nrterms are included
the solutions reduce to seventeen. each solution is characterized by a the number of free
parameters which are essentially the eld vevs left undetermined by the particular solution.
particular attention has been paid in the determination of those conditions necessary to

32

ensure the existence in the massless spectrum of the su(4) breaking higgses and at least
two higgs electroweak doublets in order to break the gut and sm gauge symmetries
respectively. these conditions have been imposed as additional constraints on the consistent
d and f at directions and all phenomenologically acceptable string vacua have been
determined.

three distinct at directions, characterized by their su(4)-higgs properties are investi-
gated in detail and the predictions of the corresponding eld theory models are discussed.
a). the rst of these predicts that the mgu t /mstringratio is related to the up quark
mass ratio of the second and third generations. the choice of the gut breaking higgs
representations leaves a sucient number of yukawa couplings which produce naturally a
hierarchical fermion mass spectrum for all three generations through treelevel and fourth
order nonrenormalizable superpotential terms. further, an analysis of the superpotential
nrterms up to sixth order shows that all but one of the colour triplet elds become mas-
sive. it is worth noting that there are no dangerous proton decay operators up to this order
of calculation since the massless triplet pair does not couple to ordinary matter elds up to
the sixth order. the absence of yukawa couplings between this triplet and ordinary matter
elds may be attributed to the properties of peculiar u(1)-symmetry of the specic string
basisvector generating this particular state. it is likely however that higher order terms
may provide a heavy mass to the remaining colour triplet pair.
b). in a second case analyzed in this work, a similar hierarchical fermion mass pattern is
found, while all triplets become massive if in addition hidden elds are allowed to acquire
nonzero vevs. on the other hand, in contrast to the rst model analyzed in section 7,
here the gut scale has only an upper bound determined by the u(1)a breaking scale.
c). finally, a third eective eld theory model is analyzed where all colour sextet elds be-
come massive at the treelevel. this model has fewer yukawa couplings available for masses,
however, additional fermion mass terms may arise from higher order nonrenormalizable
terms.

a novel feature of the eective eld theory is the existence of an additional u(1)-
symmetry which survives down to low energies, and it is possessed by exotic states and the
hidden sector elds. it is argued that if the lightest of these states receives mass at some
intermediate scale, may play a role in the dark matter of the universe.

in the present paper our phenomenological explorations have been restricted mainly
with respect to the following two issues: first, while there exist various ways to dene the
electric charge operator of the model (due to the existence of surplus u(1) factors), only
the standard hypercharge embedding has been considered in the phenomenological analysis.
we believe that it is worth exploring also dierent types of embedding although one has
to face diculties mainly with low initial sin2 w values. second, the investigation of at
directions has been limited in the cases where only observable elds are allowed to obtain
nonzero vevs. certainly, the inclusion of the hidden states in the analysis will lead to a
large number of new mass terms, the breaking of the hidden symmetry and modications
of the at directions found in this work. yet, such a possibility has to be compared with
analogous investigations of higher order nrterms will may or may not prove sucient to
obtain realist low energy eective theory.

10 appendix a: the spectrum

we collect here the massless observable and hidden supereld spectrum of the model.
fermionic string models contain always an untwisted usually called neveuschwarz (ns)
sector where all worldsheet fermions are antiperiodic. in this sector, the gso projections
leave always in the massless spectrum the multiplet which contains the graviton, the dilaton
and the twoindex antisymmetric tensor. the nssector includes also the gauge bosons
and other higgs and singlet elds. twisted (r) sectors provide the generations and other
matter elds.

the states are classied in four separate tables according to their transformation prop-
erties under the various parts of the gauge symmetry. in the rst column of each table
we give the symbol of the representation as this is used in the text. in the last column
we show the relevant sector of the string basis. in all other columns we exhibit the gauge
group properties of the states. thus, table 3 contains the observable elds, which have
nontrivial transformation properties under the pssymmetry. these are obtained from
the sectors b1,2,3,4,5 and s +b4+b5. they include the three generations, the higgses and other
elds. table 4 includes the ps singlets with their charges under the four u(1) symmetries.
in table 5 we present the hidden su(8) elds with the corresponding charges under the
ve u(1)s. finally, in table 6 we collect all exotic states with fractional charges under the
standard hypercharge assignment.

11 appendix b: nonrenormalizable contributions

in the rst part of this appendix we give a brief description of the techniques used to
calculate the treelevel and higher order nrsuperpotential terms of the model. in the
second part we give a list of the nonrenormalizable superpotential terms involving mass
terms (up to th order) and f atness conditions (up to sixth order).

1) the calculation of nonrenormalizable contributions to the superpotential in the con-
text of freefermionic formulation is a straightforward but rather tedious task. the rules
for calculation of nr terms have been presented in [17] while explicit calculation for various
models have been presented in [20, 28, 29]. in general, a superpotential term involving the
chiral superelds 1, 2, . . . , n is proportional to the correlator

1 2 . . . n  dv f

1 v f

2v b

ne
3 . . . v b

where v f
 stands for the fermionic part of the vertex operator corresponding to the eld 
and v b
 for the bosonic part. the correlators can be calculated using conformal eld theory
techniques developed in [30, 32, 31]. an important subtlety is that in order to guarantee
conformal invariance the bosonic vertex operators v b
n need to be pictured changed
to the zeroth picture.

4, . . . , v b

a superpotential term vanishes if the corresponding correlator vanishes otherwise it
leads to an o(1) coupling. there are two systematic sources of zeros in the superpotential.
the rst is group invariance, the second are the internal symmetries associated with the
fermionized compactied coordinates. the former is obvious while latter has been explored
in [16] where a set of selection rules has been derived. since these selection rules help
signicantly to the reduction of candidate superpotential terms we summarize here the
basic results.

the fermions 1, 2, . . . , 6 corresponding to the compactied coordinates can be bosonized

as follows

(1  2)/2 = exp{s12}
(3  4)/2 = exp{s34}
(5  6)/2 = exp{s56}

n = 2 worldsheet superconformal symmetry implies the existence of an extra current,
which is expressed in terms of sij as follows

j(q) = q(s12 + s34 + s56)

(113)

and which is promoted to three u(1)s generated by s12, s34, s56. the relevant part of the
vertex operators has the form

number after application of the selection rules, group invariance and the nal number after
complete evaluation of the correlators for the model under consideration.

where  1
2, (1) are the ghost numbers for fermions and bosons respectively. physical states
can now separated in two types ns (untwisted) and r(twisted). each type can be further di-
vided in three categories (the three orbifold planes in the orbifold language). in the notation
of eq. (114) the three categories of nselds have charges (, , )={(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)}
while for relds (, , )={(0, 1

2, 0)} respectively.

using the terminology explained above we can derive a set of selection rules based on the
conservation of the three u(1) charges s12, s34, s56. these selection rules are presented in
table 8 for nrterms up to ninth order. the notation we use is to write in square brackets
the allowed partition of elds in each of the categories for given order n. the allowed eld
type (ns or r) appears as a subscript. as an example let us explain the allowed fth order
couplings. from the table we read [3r, 2r, 0] when the number of nselds is zero and
[2r, 2r, 1n s] when the number of nselds is one. the rst selection rule means that in
any nonvanishing coupling between twisted elds the three of them have to belong to a
common plane while the other two should both reside in one of the other planes. in the
case that one untwisted eld participates in the coupling, the twisted ones should reside in
the other two planes and there should be exactly two of them in each one. as seen from
the table, all 5th order couplings which contain more that one ns eld, vanish.

in order to see the eect of the above selection rules we present in table 7 the number of
couplings that are eliminated (for n  5) from this source in the model under consideration.
we also present the number of couplings surviving group invariance and the nal number
of nonvanishing superpotential couplings. going further to the evaluation of correlators
one nds another source of zeros. these are the ising type correlators arising due to the
existence of nontrivial leftright paired worldsheet fermions. for treelevel couplings,
the nonvanishing ising correlators are

h++i ,hi ,h+fi ,h+

fi

(115)

for higher order terms one can follow the rules of [32].

the whole problem of deriving the superpotential terms can be automated using a
computer program [33]. the selection rules are initially used to reduce the number of
candidate couplings, then group invariance is checked and nally all ising type correlators
are evaluated. the whole calculation takes a few seconds on a personal computer for n = 5
and comparable time for selected n = 6 couplings.

using this program we have calculated nonvanishing superpotential couplings.

12 appendix c: f and datness equations

the identication of the at directions in the scalar potential requires the vanishing of
the f and dterms. in section 6, the complete fatness conditions with treelevel
superpotential contributions were presented. hidden eld contributions are also easily
calculated from the superpotential (35). fourth order contributions from both hidden and
observable sectors can also be found from the superpotential terms (36) presented in the
same section. higher order terms have also been calculated and are given in appendix b.
for convenience, the contributing fth and sixth order nr superpotential terms are written
separately in the w5 and w6 pieces of the nr superpotential.

generates a constant fayet-iliopoulos contribution to the dterm of the anomalous u(1)a.
this is proportional to the trace of the anomalous charge over all elds. to preserve
supersymmetry the following datness condition should be satised,

13 appendix d: treelevel at directions.

we present here the treelevel at directions of the model. as has been explained in section
6, the solutions are classied in four distinct cases according to whether the singlet vevs
1,4, 1,4 are zero or nonzero. it was shown there that only the cases 1 = 4 = 0 ( assigned
as case (iii) in section 6) and 1 = 4 = 0 (with 1, = 4 6= 0, referred as case (iv) in the
same section) have solutions consistent with f and d atness constraints.

our analysis proceeded as follows: first we solved the constraints taking into account
contributions only from the treelevel yukawa superpotential. an exhaustive analysis shows
that at treelevel there are 17 solutions for case (iii) and 9 solutions for case (iv). these
solutions are presented in tables 9. the ve columns in the middle show the elds with
zero vevs and the last column the number of free parameters. for further details in the
notation, see explanation in section 6. higher order nrcontributions up to sixth order,
reject several of these cases, resulting to those presented in section 6.

the complete list of the treelevel solutions given in table 9 is related to atness
constraints involving elds only from the observable sector. these are easily extended to
solutions involving hidden elds by using the atness conditions of appendix c. solutions
involving hidden eld contributions of higher nr superpotential terms are more involved
and need a separate treatment.
