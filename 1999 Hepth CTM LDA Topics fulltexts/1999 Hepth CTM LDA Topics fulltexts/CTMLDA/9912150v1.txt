abstract

we carefully re-examine the issues of solving the modied bianchi identity, anomaly can-
cellations and ux quantization in the s1/z2 orbifold of m-theory using the boundary-free
upstairs formalism, avoiding several misconceptions present in earlier literature. while the

solution for the four-form g to the modied bianchi identity appears to depend on an arbitrary

parameter b, we show that requiring g to be globally well-dened, i.e. invariant under small

and large gauge and local lorentz transformations, xes b = 1. this value also is necessary

for a consistent reduction to the heterotic string in the small-radius limit. insisting on prop-

erly dening all elds on the circle, we nd that there is a previously unnoticed additional

contribution to the anomaly inow from the eleven-dimensional topological term. anomaly
cancellation then requires a quadratic relation between b and the combination 6/4 of the

gauge and gravitational coupling constants  and . this contrasts with previous beliefs that

anomaly cancellation would give a cubic equation for b. we observe that our solution for g

automatically satises integer or half-integer ux quantization for the appropriate cycles. we

also explicitly write out the anomaly cancelling terms of the heterotic string as inherited from

the m-theory approach. they dier from the usual ones by the addition of a well-dened local

counterterm.

1. introduction and summary

ever since the emergence of m-theory and its relation to the various perturbative string the-

ories, considerations of anomaly cancellation have played a crucial role.
in particular, in
reconstructing the strongly-coupled e8  e8 heterotic string from m-theory compactied on
s1/z2 [1, 2], an important ingredient was the observation that the gauge and gravitational
anomaly polynomial of the e8  e8 heterotic string can be written as a sum of two terms,
each being associated with one e8 factor, and that each of these terms separately factorises

as required by anomaly cancellation through a green-schwarz mechanism. this enables local
anomaly cancellation on each of the two ten-dimensional s1/z2 xed planes in the m-theory
picture [1, 2, 3]. the anomaly-cancelling terms in m-theory are of two types: one is a green-

schwarz termr g  x7 where g is the (modied) eld strength of the three-form c and x7

is a purely gravitational chern-simons type seven-form. the presence of this green-schwarz

term was well-known from string duality [4, 5] and as a cancelling term for the m-theory

ve-brane anomaly [5, 6]. the second contribution is anomaly inow from the topological

interaction term of eleven-dimensional supergravity [7]r c  g g. in uncompactied eleven-

dimensional m-theory both terms are gauge and local lorentz invariant and no anomaly needs
to be cancelled in this odd dimension. however, orbifold compactications like s1/z2 involve
chiral projections on the even-dimensional xed planes and then there are chiral anomalies

which need to be cancelled. on the other hand, it has been shown in [2] that closure of the
supersymmetry algebra for the s1/z2 orbifold implies a modication of the bianchi identity

dg = 0, and this is why ther g  x7 andr c  g  g terms have non-vanishing anomalous

transformations under gauge and local so(9, 1) lorentz transformations on the xed planes.

this is the basic mechanism at the origin of local anomaly cancellation.

in ref. [2], the modied bianchi identity dg 6= 0 was solved in a particular way and it was
concluded that anomaly cancellation requires a certain xed ratio 3/2 of the gauge coupling

 and the gravitational coupling . subsequent analyses [813] have in particular emphasized
that there actually is a one-parameter family of solutions g(b), b  r, to the modied bianchi

it was concluded that anomaly cancellation alone does not x the ratio 3/2 but
identity.

 of course, to any solution g(0) = dc + . . . of dg = . . . one can add a da(3) with any three-form a(3).
the point is that most of these a(3) can be reabsorbed into c. so the only relevant a(3) must be made
from the gauge and lorentz chern-simons three-form (3) on the xed planes so that essentially the only
freedom is a(3)  b(3) with one real parameter b.

relates it to a cubic polynomial in this parameter b. it was argued that this parameter and
hence 3/2 can be xed if one also takes into account the quantization of the ux of g [14].

in this paper, we carefully reanalyse the issues of solving the modied bianchi identity,
anomaly cancellation and ux quantization for the s1/z2 orbifold. we use the upstairs
formalism where one works on the boundary-free circle s1 and imposes a z2 projection on
the elds. however, contrary to most of the previous papers, we insist on dening properly
all elds on s1, i.e. elds should be periodic. this immediately rules out the use of the
step function (x11) as a primitive of a delta function (x11) on the circle. using instead a
correctly periodically dened function (x11) such that     1
2 turns out to be crucial
to obtain a consistent solution g to the modied bianchi identity. we carefully investigate

gauge and local lorentz invariance of g. it turns out that insisting on invariance under large

transformations, i.e.

insisting on having a globally well-dened g, is very powerful. it not

only implies the well-known cohomology condition [15], but it also xes the parameter b of the

with r (tr f 2
i  1

solution g to be 1, as long as there are topologically non-trivial gauge or gravity congurations
2tr r2) 6= 0. the value b = 1 also appears to be the only one which allows
a safe truncation to the perturbative heterotic string: although the zero-modes on the circle
correctly give the desired relation h = db  ym + l for all values of b, the neglected higher
modes are gauge and local lorentz invariant only if b = 1. contrary to what was generally

believed, these arguments leading to b = 1 are not a consequence of g-ux quantization. we

note that the downstairs approach automatically incorporates a correspondingly xed value of

b.

looking carefully at anomaly cancellations also yields some surprises. we do the analysis
for arbitrary parameter b. again the use of the periodic (x11) is crucial, in particular the
constant term in     1
2 plays an important role. due to this term, the relation between
b and the ratio 3/2 required by anomaly cancellation is drastically modied with respect to

previous analyses [2, 813]: the terms cubic in b cancel, and one is left with a quadratic equation
for b namely b2 = 12
(4)5 6/4. also, to obtain this equation, one has to evaluate products of the
form (x11)(x11)(x11) where (x11) is our periodic generalisation of the step function. but

of course, this product is ill-dened and should be regularised. any reasonable regularisation
yields (x11)(x11)(x11)  1
3 in the above equation
determining the parameter b from anomaly cancellations in terms of 3/2. this completely

modied, now quadratic equation will have important consequences when considering further
orbifold compactication [13], e.g. on t 4/z2, where the analysis has encountered certain

diculties.

this will be examined elsewhere [16].

we then conclude that b must be one, and hence 6 = (4)5

ically non-trivial sector of the theory where r (tr f 2
i  1
12 b2 = (4)5

12 4. indeed, in any topolog-
2 tr r2) 6= 0 we have b = 1. anomaly
cancellation then xes the ratio 6/4 = (4)5
12 . but this ratio does not depend
on whether the integral is zero or not, so that by this same equation b = 1 always (strictly
speaking: b2 = 1). it is worthwhile noticing that g diers from dc also away from the xed

planes since b 6= 0. we further note that the green-schwarz termr g x7 also automatically

ensures cancellation of the ve-brane anomalies without any need of further modication. as

a consistency check of our solution we show how the combination of the topological term and

the green-schwarz term in eleven dimensions leads to the green-schwarz term of the heterotic

string.

another subtle point is ux quantization of g. in the downstairs approach where one

considers m-theory compactied on the interval i = s1/z2, i.e.
dimensional boundary planes of the eleven-dimensional space-time, there is no modication of

in the presence of ten-

the bianchi identity dg = 0, but there is a non-trivial boundary condition on g [2] enabling

the necessary anomaly inow to cancel the one-loop anomaly on the boundary planes. this

boundary condition does not admit a free parameter like b (i.e. it is equivalent to a xed value
2tr r2)|boundary. witten concluded [14] that for any
g has to be integer or half-integer. in particular, this ensures

of b) and reads g|boundary = 2

dened only for integer ux, but it was shown in ref. [14] that in the case of half-integer ux

the three-dimensional membrane functional integral has a parity anomaly [17] which precisely

cancels the sign ambiguity due to the half-integrality of the g-ux.

in the boundary-free

upstairs approach where the bianchi identity for g is modied this same ux quantization

should appear as a consequence of our solution. we will show that this is indeed the case.
any four-cycle c4 can be written as a sum of four-cycles not involving the x11-direction and of
four-cycles of the form s1  c3 with c3 not in the x11-direction. in the rst case our solution
g to the modied bianchi identity straightforwardly yields wittens result of integer or half-

downstairs with the necessary factor of
1/2 [9]). four-cycles of the second type wrap around the circle s1. there is no analogue of

upstairs and 2

these cycles in the downstairs approach, and we cannot conclude on any quantization from the

results of [14]. indeed, for such cycles, we nd that the b dependence trivially cancels (as always

dc  1

when integrating over the circle, thanks to the modication of the step function in order to be

periodic!) and one is left with an integral a rs1c3
2pirc3ei where the sum is
over the two xed planes and ei is a combination of gauge and lorentz chern-simons three-
forms on the ith plane. this integral is closely related to the uxr h =r (db  ym + l) in

the heterotic string. the latter was discussed some time ago [18] and it was concluded (when
appropriately normalised) to be of the form n +  with n  z,   r. the same argument
holds here and we conclude that the gauge and local lorentz invariant combination a cannot
be determined further. the reason of course is that since g 6= dc one cannot use the standard
argument to obtain ux quantization. we conclude that for four-cycles not wrapping the circle
s1 we have standard integer or half-integer ux quantization, while if the four-cycle wraps the
s1 we cannot say anything interesting about the ux of g.

this paper is organised as follows. in section 2, we discuss preliminaries: conventions and
normalisations, and the correctly modied, periodically-dened step function (x11) on the

circle, as well as the above-mentioned occurrence of an extra factor of 1/3 when evaluating

integrals involving . in section 3, we carefully solve the modied bianchi identity for g

and discuss gauge and local lorentz invariance and how the global denition of g xes b. we

also comment on the relation to the perturbative heterotic string. section 4 discusses anomaly
cancellations and the quadratic relation between b and 6/4 is obtained. section 5 is devoted

to ux (non) quantization of g and in section 6 we spell out the heterotic anomaly-cancelling

terms as inherited from the present m-theory approach. we conclude in section 7 and an

appendix summarises the relevant anomaly polynomials [19, 20] needed in this paper.

2. preliminaries

2.1. conventions and normalisations

since in the next section we want to pin down various numerical coecients, normalisations

are important. our conventions are as follows.

normalisations of elds and couplings

the anomaly polynomials i12(1loop)i, x8 and i4,i are dened in the appendix. in particular
we have

i4,i =

(2.1)

for any four-cycle c4. for dierential forms, we use the standard normalisation: a p-form a(p)
is given in terms of its completely antisymmetric components as

a(p) =

1
p!

a(p)
1...p dx1  . . .  dxp =

p!

a(p)
[1...p] dx1  . . .  dxp,

(2.2)

and d = dx so that in particular f = da + a2 = 1
eld of eleven-dimensional supergravity c = 1

2 f dx  dx and for the three-form

3!c dx  dx  dx.

the normalisation of the eleven-dimensional supergravity action [7] is

962 gg(cid:21) + stop + . . .

(2.3)

where r is the curvature scalar and e the square root of the determinant of the eleven-
dimensional metric.   11 is the eleven-dimensional gravitational coupling. the so-called
topological term is of central importance for us:

stop =

122z c  g  g,

(2.4)

where g = dc + . . . omitted terms indicated by . . . involve the gravitino eld.

 our normalisation is related to the one used by horava and witten [2] by chw

similarly, the action for the ten-dimensional gauge elds is

sgauge = 

1

42z d10x g10 fabf ab + . . . ,

(2.5)

with gauge coupling constant  and f = da + a2. on the s1/z2 xed planes, g10 is the
restriction of the eleven-dimensional metric to the planes.

as usual, we use , , . . . for eleven-dimensional indices and a, b, . . . for ten-dimensional

ones.

engineering dimensions

it is often useful to have in mind the dimensions of the various quantities and couplings.
taking [mass] = 1 as usual, one has [] =  9
2 and [] = 3. with these two parameters,
a dimensionless combination is 3
2 ] = 3 and this latter combination may be used
whenever a dimensionful constant is needed. gauge and lorentz connections have dimension

2 while [ 2

one and then [r] = [f ] = 2 so that [i4,i] = 4 and [x8] = 8. we also take [c] = 0 and [g] = 1

(for forms, by [c] we really mean [c], etc. . . ).

2.2. the orbifold s1/z2

we consider the eleven-dimensional manifold as the product of a ten-dimensional manifold
m10 and a circle s1. for notational convenience, and to emphasize that the coordinate on the
circle is an angular variable (we are working in the upstairs approach), we use

  [, ]  s1 ,

(2.6)

rather than x11. this denition also means that we work in general on a circle with unit radius.

we will however reintroduce an arbitrary radius r when discussing the small-radius limit, i.e.
the perturbative heterotic limit. this will be done by assuming that   [r, r]. the z2
symmetry acts by    so that the two xed planes are copies of m10 at  = 0  1 and
 =   2. we then dene the one-forms

1 = () d ,

2 = (  ) d .

(2.7)

these one-forms are well-dened on the circle s1 by denition, i.e.

2 = (  ) d 
( + ) d. we further need zero-forms i such that di includes i. determining a primitive

6

of a -function on a circle requires however a minimum of care: a simple step function () will

not do the job since it is not periodic. it seems surprising that this simple fact was overlooked

in previous discussions of anomaly inow through the modied bianchi identity. in fact there

cannot be a function () on the circle, i.e. a periodic function () = ( + 2), such that
() = (). would it exist, one would also have
 d () =
()  () = 0. the best one can do is to dene for   [, ]

 d () =r 

1 =rs1  =r 



1() = sign()

(2.8)

it is periodic, odd under z2, and satises 1() = 1() = 0. similarly one denes 2() =
1() = 2()  1
1(  ). these functions satisfy 
 . in form
notation, these denitions can be concisely written as

2() = 2(  )  1

 and 

di = 2i

d ,

i = 1, 2.

(2.9)

later on we will need integrals of products of these i over the circle. they are elementary

and can be concisely written as

zs1

d ij = (cid:18)ij 

1

3(cid:19) ,

i, j = 1, 2,

(2.10)

where of course here and in the following ij stands for the kronecker symbol. since the i()

are odd functions with respect to the z2, one also has

zs1

d i = 0 .

(2.11)

another delicate point concerns integrals of products of one  function and two  functions,

which are z2-even distributions. it is often argued that one can replace e.g. 111 by 1 since
due to the  only the immediate vicinity of  = 0 is important, and then (1(0))2  +1.

 for the integral of a periodic function one can of course integrate over any interval of length 2. however,
since the orbifold singularities are at 0 and   , in order to avoid misinterpretations and have each
singularity exactly once, it is preferable not to integrate from  to  but to slightly shift the interval of

integration. thus, for example,r 

 d is meant to be lim0r 

 d.

7

this argument is certainly incorrect. an expression like 111 is ill-dened and has to be

regularised. one could as well say that 1(0) = 0, implying 111 = 0 and this would be

equally wrong. any sensible regularisation should preserve the one relation we want to hold,

namely (2.9), as well as z2-oddness of the i. then indeed in the vicinity of  = 0 the linear
piece / in 1 is unimportant and

(2.14)

2.3. the modified bianchi identity for g

horava and witten [2] consider the eleven-dimensional supergravity action (2.3) on the prod-
uct of m10 with the orbifold s1/z2, coupled to e8 super-yang-mills actions located on the
two m10 xed planes, at  = 0 and  = . the z2 projection breaks one half of the thirty-two

supersymmetries. preserving the sixteen remaining supersymmetries requires however a mod-

ication of the bianchi identity of the four-form eld g, involving the yang-mills curvatures.

as usual in string eective actions, anomaly cancellation in turn requires the appearance in this

modication of lorentz curvatures: this contribution cannot be derived from supersymmetry

of eective actions with up to two derivatives.

(2.15)

as already mentioned, the classical supersymmetry calculation only yields the tr f 2 term. the
tr r2 term is a higher-order eect. the factor 2/2 can be inferred by simple dimensional

analysis, since [i] = 1.

3. solution of the modied bianchi identity

3.1. a one-parameter family of solutions

we now proceed to solve the modied bianchi identity (2.15). the combination of tr f 2
i
and tr r2 that appears is usually called i4,i. our normalisations for all relevant anomaly-
related polynomials in f and r are summarised in appendix a. in particular, we have i4,i =

1

(4)2(cid:0)tr f 2
i  1

2tr r2(cid:1) and thus the bianchi identity reads

2xi
dg = (4)2 2

i  i4,i .

(3.1)

since i has support only on the ith xed plane and is a one-form  d, only the values of the
smooth four-form i4,i on this xed plane matter and only the components not including d
are relevant. for the gauge piece tr f 2
i this is automatic, but for the tr r2 piece this is a non-
trivial statement. it will prove convenient to use two-dimensional descent equations i4 = d3,
3 = d1
2 with all forms having no d component. we will use the following convention: a
tilde on a p-form a(p)

and by setting the argument  = i, i.e. equal to 0 or  depending on whether i = 1 or 2.

clearly, d takes a tilde p-form to a tilde (p + 1)-form: dea(p)
we can then replace i4,i by ei4,i which has the eect of replacing r  eri  er|=i. one has
eri = dei +ei ei with ei the correspondingly mutilated spin-connection. using this ei, one

the discussions and anomaly cancellations of this paper have nothing to do with membranes (except for
a short comment in sect. 5).

however, we will see in the next subsection that b1 = +b2 is needed as long asr ei4,i is non-vanishing.

3.2. gauge and local lorentz invariance

now we want g to be gauge and local lorentz invariant. while ei4,i
simons three-formei is not and hence c cannot be invariant either. since the variation of c

will be crucial for anomaly cancellation, care must be taken. the most general c giving an

us repeat that c is such that g = 0.

3.3. global definition of g: invariance under large transformations

so far we have considered invariance under small transformations that can be continuously

deformed to the identity. however, g must also be invariant under large gauge and large local

lorentz transformations. this will be precisely the case if g is globally well-dened. there is

a simple criterion when this is true [15]. if g is globally well-dened, i.e. dg is exact, then
dg = 0. take c5 = c4  s1 where c4 is an arbitrary
four-cycle at xed value of  or homologous to such a cycle and rewrite dg using the bianchi

for any (closed) ve-cycle c5 one hasrc5

identity (3.4). one then gets

(3.10)

the analogous cohomology condition is well-known from the heterotic string. so g will be

invariant also under large transformations precisely if this condition holds. of course, since we

do want g to be invariant we assume this condition henceforth.

however, there is one more important piece of information we can obtain from requiring
global denition of g and using stokes theorem. consider a ve-volume v which intersects
exactly one of the xed planes. for example, we may take it of the form v = i  c where
c is a four-cycle and i is the interval [1, 2] with  < 1 < 0 and 0 < 2 < . then
v = c(2)  c(1) and stokes theorem gives

zv

dg = zc(2)

g  zc(1)

g .

(3.11)

now, the integral on the l.h.s. is evaluated using the modied bianchi identity (3.4) and, due

to the -function, it collapses to an integral ofei4,1 over the four-cycle c on the xed plane. on
the other hand, the integrals on the r.h.s are evaluated using the solution (3.6) for g. only
the components gabcd contribute, i.e. only the piece b
 = 2 one has 1(2) = 1  2
1(1) = 1  1

(3.12)

the term on the r.h.s. depending on 1  2 vanishes thanks to the cohomology condition
(3.10). we are left with



zc ei4,1 = bzc ei4,1 .

(3.13)

had we chosen the ve-volume v to intersect the other xed plane we would have obtained
in

rcei4,2 = brcei4,2 , but by (3.10) this is equivalent. we see there are two possibilities.
the rst case,rcei4,1 = 0 meaning that each of the two source terms in the modied bianchi
identity individually is cohomologically trivial, so that the ei can be globally well-dened. in
this case we see that b is unconstrained. in the second casercei4,1 6= 0 meaning that each of

the two source terms individually is cohomologically non-trivial (although their sum is trivial

by (3.10)).

in this case one must take b = 1. note that b = 1 eliminates the terms in g

containing -functions so that then g becomes nite everywhere.

to summarize, with the z2 projection (3.9) on the three-index tensor, global denition

of g corresponds to the transformation (3.8) and the cohomology condition (3.10), as well as

(3.13).

3.4. the case b = 1

as just noted, b = 1 is required whenever r ei4,i

6= 0. in this case delta-function singularities
are absent from g. the case b = 1 also presents some other interesting and important features

when considering eqs. (3.6) and (3.8) from the point of view of reduction to the perturbative

heterotic string.

 above we had mentioned the possibility of introducing a b1 and a b2, one for each xed plane. going

through the same argument as was just done, one nds that there are extra terms  (b1b2)(12)r ei4,1
on the r.h.s. of (3.12). ifr ei4,1 6= 0 these terms must disappear, and hence b1 = b2  b.

13

expanding gabc,11 and cab,11 in fourier modes along s1 straightforwardly leads to

[e1 +e2]abc,

n > 0.

(3.14)

the zero mode is b-independent. since g is gauge and local lorentz invariant we see that
c(0)

ab,11 can be neither gauge nor local lorentz invariant. on the other hand, the higher modes
of cab,11 are gauge and local lorentz invariant if and only if b = 1. to make contact with

ten-dimensional heterotic strings in the eld-theory (perturbative) limit, we want to truncate

cab,11 to its zero-mode only, and this truncation is safe only if the higher modes are gauge

invariant. this again points towards b = 1.

in the next section we will show that anomaly cancellations relate b2 and 6/4, but do

not x one or the other. however, the gauge and local lorentz variation of the topological

term will have a b-dependent contribution which is a variation of a (local) counterterm and

hence does not contribute to the formal twelve-form which characterizes the anomaly. the

appearance of this term is related to the b-dependent contributions in the variation of c, and

then to the higher modes in its expansion. on the other hand, a direct calculation of the
anomaly-cancelling terms, by rst truncating c to c(0) and then calculating the resulting

ten-dimensional action leads directly to a green-schwarz term which corresponds to b = 1, the

case in which all truncated modes are gauge invariant. this will be done in sect. 6.

the conclusion then is that anomaly cancellation alone does not x b. the perturbative
heterotic limit however (the small s1 radius limit) selects b = 1 because it ensures gauge

invariance of the massive modes. this condition is essentially due to compactication on a

small space. as we have seen in the previous subsection, global considerations also impose

b = 1, provided topologically non-trivial congurations occur.

3.5. a consistency check: reduction to the heterotic string

when the circle s1 is very small the perturbative heterotic string theory must emerge. the

elds of the latter are dened (modulo possible rescalings) as the zero-modes of the fourier

expansion on the circle of the corresponding m-theory elds.

in particular, as mentioned

(3.15)

where we have introduced an arbitrary radius r of s1. integrating the abc, 11 components
of the solution (3.6) for g over the circle s1 yields

h = db +



2rxi ei .

(3.16)

as already observed in (3.14), the parameter b disappears thanks to the last term in (3.6), a
term due to the condition of s1 periodicity of the z2-odd step function i(). in the small

radius limit, the lorentz chern-simons forms contained in e1 and e2 become the same and
we can replace e1 +e2 by

(4)2 (3ym  3l) and (3.16) becomes



1

h = db 

2
2r2 (3ym  3l) .

upon reexpressing   11 in terms of the ten-dimensional gravitational coupling 10 and
rescaling the elds to ones favorite normalisations, one obtains the standard relation for the
heterotic string. in our case, 2

the gauge variation of bb can be directly obtained from its denition and the expression of

4. anomaly cancellations

the z2 orbifold projection generates a chiral spectrum and, as a consequence, a chiral gauge,

mixed and gravitational quantum anomaly in m10 which can be characterized by a formal

twelve-form. we have seen that the modication of the bianchi identity is at the origin of a

well-dened gauge and lorentz variation of the three-form eld c. this variation will in turn

produce an anomalous variation of the action. we now study the sources for this anomaly

inow and prove anomaly cancellation. in this section we still keep b as a parameter, since

from the m-theoretic point of view, the requirement b = 1 occurs in the rst place only if

r ei4,i 6= 0. even in the topological sector wherer ei4,i = 0 there are anomalies which need to
sector where r ei4,i

be cancelled. in any case we will nd that anomaly cancellation relates b2 to 6/4. in the
6= 0 and b = 1 this then xes the ratio 6/4. but this ratio should not
depend on the topological sector of the theory and this in turn will imply that b = 1 always.

4.1. anomaly inflow from stop

it is now straightforward to determine the anomaly inow due to the topological term stop:

stop = 

1

122z c  g  g .

(4.1)

since c only contains components with a d, only the components of g not containing d

can contribute, i.e. gabcd. remembering that cabc = 0, we get from (3.6) gabcd =
b

2pj j(ei4,j )abcd and hence

independent of . the purpose of introducing the tilde quantities was precisely to make

(4.7)

since the eld g is real, the parameter b is real as well and b2 is necessarily positive, as is 4

so the sign of the coecient in i (top)
is xed. this reects the fact that n = 1 ten-dimensional

12

supersymmetry is chiral and specic signs appear in the bianchi identity once the gravitino

chirality is chosen. in any case, the above sign is as required to cancel the quantum anomaly

generated by chiral fermions.

it is quite amazing that the two so dierent looking anomalies s(1)

to the same anomaly twelve-form (apart from the dierent b-dependence). however, using

top and s(2)

the descent equations, as explained in appendix a, it is not dicult to explicitly nd a local

4.2. anomaly inflow from the green-schwarz term

2tr r4  1

we still have to determine the variation of the green-schwarz term r g  x7. here arises
the question whether one should take r g  x7 or r c  x8 with x8 = dx7 and x8 =
(4)3 12(cid:0) 1
8 (tr r2)2(cid:1) (cf. eq. (a.5) in the appendix). note that x8 obeys dx8 = 0
same steps withr c  x8 as above withr c  g  g we will show below that this form does
not allow to cancel the one-loop anomalies. the correct form is r g  x7. the appropriate

and x8 = 0. both choices are equivalent if g = dc, but dier at present. going through the

normalisation of this term is known independently [4, 5], but we will rederive it from the

present anomaly cancellation. let

where  = (4)2 2

in any case, in the second term however, x8 genuinely depends on the circle
choice of c.

z c  x8 = c (b  1)zm10 xi e1
while in the rst term the -function has the eect of replacing x8 by ex8,i, in the second
= c(b  1)piei4,i  ex8,i and has the right form. its coecient however is wrong:
bi (gs,1)
coordinate  and there is no way to make it equal to ex8,i on the ith plane as needed for
anomaly cancellation. we conclude that bsgs could be suitable at best only for b = 0. but
discriminate between sgs and bsgs relies on the presence of the second term in (4.14) and this

this case is certainly ruled out as it would lead to stop = 0. note that the possibility to

term again is a consequence of enforcing periodicity of the step functions i().

4.3. cancellation of the one-loop anomaly

the sum i (top)
12 must cancel the one-loop anomaly given in the appendix, eq. (a.5).
(these expressions refer to ten-dimensional anomalies on a given xed plane and should be

12 + i (gs)

understood as involving only tilde quantities.) it is

i12(1loop) =xi (cid:16) 

3

(ei4,i )3 +ei4,i  ex8,i(cid:17) .

we get anomaly cancellation, i (top)

12 + i (gs)

12 + i12(1loop) = 0, if and only if

and

b2 =

(4)5

c = 1 .

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

while c = 1 was known previously, from cancellation of the anomaly due to a ve-brane

20

(see below), the literature contains a large amount of confusion around the equation for the

parameter b. the fact that this equation is quadratic, as we show here, instead of cubic is a

signicant change of the picture drawn by the various authors who have developed the original

proposal of horava and witten.

using eqs. (4.9), (4.12) and (4.16) we may now rewrite the total anomalous variation as

stop + sgs =

 b 10i  zm10 hei4,1 ex 1

6,2i .
6,1 +ei4,2 ex 1

(4.18)

note that the term  b is the variation of a local ten-dimensional counterterm, and this is why
it does not contribute to the twelve-form of the descent equations. we will see in section 6 that
in the small s1 radius limit corresponding to the perturbative heterotic string, this particular

form of the anomalous variation is at the origin of a local counterterm usually unexpected

from standard ten-dimensional arguments.

4.4. the five-brane anomaly

the same green-schwarz term (4.11) is also able to cancel any additional ve-brane anomaly



.

the latter is a purely gravitational anomaly of the six-dimensional chiral theory living on the

worldvolume of the ve-brane (a chiral tensor multiplet). the invariant eight-form correspond-

ing to this one-loop anomaly simply is

i 5brane
8

(1loop) = x8 ,

(4.19)

where the sign on the r.h.s actually depends on the choice of chirality



. the bianchi identity

for g is further modied by the presence of the ve-brane [6]:

dg|5brane contribution = (5)(w6)

(4.20)

where w6 denotes the ve-brane worldvolume and (w6) is a ve-form such that for any six-

i6. (a possible switch of chirality would produce a minus sign

form i6, r (w6)  i6 =rw6

 for ve-branes, there is also the normal bundle anomaly, but it can be taken care of independently [21]

and we will not consider it here.

 a ve-brane has a charge 1 which appears as a factor of the anomaly eight-form.

21

on the r.h.s. of (4.19) and (4.20).) then one sees immediately from (4.12) that there is an

additional ve-brane contribution to sgs:

sgs|5brane = 

which is the descendent of i (gs)

x 1
6 ,

(4.21)

we should still check that the new ve-brane contribution to dg does not spoil our previous

results. indeed, when solving the bianchi identity, g will have an extra piece:

g|with 5brane = g|without vebrane + ()(4)(w6)

(4.22)

where d()(4)(w6) = (5)(w6). there are many dierent ways to choose the primitive
()(4)(w6).
in particular one can always avoid to take the primitive in the -direction so
that none of the subtleties involving the i() are present. what is important is that the extra

piece in g does not depend on any elds and is thus trivially gauge and local lorentz invariant.

thus the variation c as given in (3.8) is unchanged. sgs is modied by the additional piece
(4.21) as desired. what about stop =  1
the previous anomaly cancellations, stop must not receive any extra contribution from the

122 r c  g  g ? if we do not want to spoil

ve-brane. we now proceed to show that this is indeed the case. since c is the same as

before, the only additional contribution is due to the additional piece in g. we then get an

additional piece in stop:

stop(extra) =

where we used (3.8) for c. if the ve-brane worldvolume does not extend in the -direction,
(5)(w6) contains a (  . . .)d, hence by the above choice ()(4)(w6) contains the same
(  . . .)d and the above integrand vanishes.
if the ve-brane worldvolume does extend
in the -direction, (5)(w6) and ()(4)(w6) are independent from  and then the only -

5. the issue of g-ux quantization

5.1. does flux quantization hold?

cancellation of all anomalies only required the validity of relation (4.16) between b2 and
6/4. to put it dierently, whatever the ratio 6/4 is, there is a choice of the parameter

b that cancels all anomalies. on the other hand, we have seen that if there are topologically
6= 0, one is forced to take b = 1 in
order to have a globally well-dened four-form eld g. we will now explore the consequences of

non-trivial gauge/gravity congurations such thatrc4ei4,i

this fact for the ux of g and compare with wittens result on ux quantization [14] obtained

in the downstairs approach which in a certain way also corresponds to a xed value of b.

we will evaluate the integral of g on the two dierent categories of four-cycles.

four-cycles not wrapping s1

consider a four-cycle c() not wrapping the s1 and at a xed value of   (0, ). then,
similarly to the derivation of eq. (3.9) we get

usually one mentions another contribution to this integral which would come from the dc

piece in g. but with cabc = 0 there is no such contribution here.

this looks much like wittens ux quantization [14] which was obtained in the downstairs

approach and which reads

to dier by a factor of two, they are actually the same. the point is that the gravitational
couplings 2 in the upstairs and downstairs approach dier precisely by this factor of two [9]:

downstairsrc g = (cid:0)n1  1

upstairs/2 and since  = (4)22/3 one also has downstairs = upstairs/2. of
downstairs = 2
course, in all our formulas   upstairs and one sees that eq (5.2) is exactly wittens ux
quantization. using eq. (4.16) with b = 1 one can reexpress this ux quantization with only

 or only  appearing as coecient, but this is not too illuminating.

four-cycles wrapping s1

we must also consider four-cycles of the form c = c3  s1 where c3 is some three-cycle at
xed value of . obviously, such cycles do not exist in the downstairs approach and we cannot

expect the corresponding ux to be related to wittens quantization condition. an arbitrary
four-cycle then is homologous to m1 times this four-cycle c plus m2 times any of the four-cycles
of the previous subsection. one has from eq. (3.6)

(5.3)

as always when integrating over s1, the b-dependent terms have cancelled. this integral is

closely related to the uxr h =r (dbym +l) in the heterotic string. indeed, as discussed

in section 3.5, it exactly reduces to the latter in the small radius limit. the ux of h was

discussed some time ago [18] and it was concluded (when appropriately normalised) to be of
the form n +  with n  z,   r. a similar argument holds here and we conclude that the
value of (5.3) cannot be determined further. the key dierence with wittens analysis [14] is
that since g 6= dc one cannot use the standard argument to obtain ux quantization.

we conclude that for four-cycles not wrapping the circle s1 we have the standard ux
quantization, while if the four-cycle wraps the s1 we cannot say anything interesting about

the ux of g.

5.2. a remark on the membrane action

let us rst review the standard argument [14]. in uncompactied m-theory or m-theory on

a smooth manifold one simply has g = dc. since this needs not hold globally one typically
argues thatrc g =rc+ dc(+) +rc dc() =rc3
(c(+)  c()) where c3 = c+ = c. but
since the membrane action t2rc3
c + . . . (t2 is the membrane tension) should be well-dened
modulo 2 one concludes that t2rc g = 2n with integer n. witten has argued [14] that the

24

three-dimensional membrane theory does in certain cases have a so-called parity anomaly [17]
which is a sign ambiguity eip, p  z of the fermion determinant. this implies that actually
the well-denedness of the membrane functional integral requires t2rc g = 2(n  1
2p). this
ts with the ux quantization since t2 =  2
 . in our present upstairs discussion however,
this relation for the g-ux holds (with the appropriate redenition of 2 by a factor of two
as discussed above) if c does not wrap the s1, but is replaced by (5.3) if it does. does this
mean that the membrane functional integral is no longer well-dened? of course not. first,
the above argument is spoiled since g 6= dc everywhere. second, a coupling of c to the
c without modication certainly does not lead to

membrane worldvolume c3 of the typerc3

a well-dened functional integral since we have observed that c is neither gauge nor local

lorentz invariant. obviously then there must be corrective terms to restore the invariance. it

would be interesting to explicitly construct these terms. a clue is probably provided by eq.

(5.3) which is gauge and local lorentz invariant.

6. the heterotic anomaly-cancelling terms

as a last check of our scheme, we compute in the small-radius limit the anomaly-cancelling

terms of the heterotic string. taking the zero modes along the circle amounts to identifying

x8,i is given in the appendix. as before, bab is identied with the zero mode 1
cf. eq. (3.15), and cabc = 0 as usual. using eq. (3.6) (with an obvious insertion of a factor
of 1

er1 and er2 with r as well as the seven-form x7 in m11 with its restriction ex7,1  ex7,2  ex7
to m10 (no d components) and similarly for x8 = dx7 and ex8,1  ex8,2  ex8. we recall that

at this point it is useful to switch to dierently normalised heterotic variables: the ten-

dimensional gravitational constant is 2

in eq. (3.18). it is also convenient to dene



10 = 2/(2r) and b is rescaled to the heterotic bb as
the heterotic eight-form bx8 and the seven-form

bx7 such that dbx7 = bx8:

in the last expression, the gauge and gravitational chern-simons three-forms 3,1, 3,2 and
3l and seven-form 7l are such that d3,i = tr f 2
i , i = 1, 2 and d3l = tr r2, d7l = tr r4

so that indeed bx7 veries dbx7 = bx8. note that our previous denitions ex7 and ex8 only had
gravitational contributions, while now, following the standard heterotic notation, bx7 and bx8

have both, gravitational and gauge, as well as mixed contributions. with these denitions,

the sum of the contributions (6.1) and (6.2) becomes

 to facilitate comparison with the literature, we note e.g. that the x8 used in the textbook by green,

the rst line is the standard green-schwarz counterterm of the heterotic string [20], while

10 = 3

the second term is a local counterterm specic to the form of the anomaly-cancelling term
generated by m-theory on s1/z2. of course, it is our old friend from eqs. (4.9) and (4.10),
namely 

10(cid:17) with b = 1. as already explained in sect. 3.4, the

small-radius limit automatically produces this term with a coecient corresponding to b = 1.
the extra factor of 3
part of this term, namely  1
(6.5), leaving us with a factor of + 1

2 with respect to eq. (4.10) is due to the usual choice of including only
2 of it, into the standard heterotic counterterm of the rst line of

1442rm10

2(cid:16)  3b3

2 for the second term.

2 + 1 = 3

7. conclusions

we have carefully studied the solution for g of the modied bianchi identity.

it appeared

to depend on an arbitrary parameter b. when requiring g to be globally well-dened, i.e.

invariant under small and large gauge and local lorentz transformations we have discovered

12

where r (tr f 2

that this parameter b is xed to b = 1 in all topologically non-trivial sectors of the theory
2) 6= 0. anomaly cancellation equates b2 and
4 , independently of the value of r (tr f 2
1  1
1). in those sectors where b = 1 this
1) vanishes or not,

1  1
12 . since this ratio cannot depend on whetherr (tr f 2
1  1

1) = r (tr f 2

anomaly cancellation in turn implies that b = 1 always.

4 = (4)5

(4)5
xes 6

2  1

2tr r2

2 tr r2

2 tr r2

thus anomaly cancellation and global well-denedness of g have selected exactly one

solution g to the modied bianchi identity. this is neither a consequence of ux quantization

nor has it anything to do with membrane actions. instead, we observe that for four-cycles not
wrapping s1, the ux of g indeed automatically obeys wittens ux quantization while for
cycles wrapping the s1 the ux is more general. also, in this s1/z2 orbifold for membranes
wrapping the s1 the naive membrane action is not gauge/local lorentz invariant and needs to

be modied.

27

we observed that b = 1 is also very natural when considering the reduction to the heterotic

string in the small radius limit, since it is only for b = 1 that all higher modes of the fourier

expansion on the circle can be consistently decoupled. we explicitly wrote out the anomaly

cancelling terms obtained from this reduction. they dier from what is usually taken in the

heterotic string by the addition of a well-dened local counterterm.

it is quite amazing that this simple s1/z2 orbifold of m-theory still had that many subtle
points to be revealed. now that we understand them, it is relatively straightforward to study

other more complicated orbifolds of m-theory. this will be done elsewhere [16].

appendix a

in this appendix, we give the relevant anomaly polynomials used in the paper. dierent authors

have conventions diering by factors of 2, etc. . . we use the conventions of [20], which were
also used in the nice appendix of [13]. recall that an anomaly an in n dimensions, i.e.
polynomial in+2 in n + 2 dimensions
(a twelve-form in our ten-dimensional case) which is related to an by the descent equations

s =r dnxan, is described by a unique gauge-invariant



in+2 = din+1 ,

in+1 = dan .

(a.1)

s +r dnx n, so that an  a

recall that this is so because the anomaly an itself is not uniquely dened. indeed we always
have the freedom to add an n-dimensional local counterterm to the action s: s  s =
n = an + n + dn1, with an arbitrary n1. on the
other hand, the descent equations imply that in+1 is dened up to a dn. but then in+1
is dened up to a dn = dn meaning that an is only dened up to a n and a dn1
as it should. when one applies the descent equations to dierent ways of writing the same
invariant anomaly polynomial in+2 one is naturally led to dierent anomalies an and a
n, the
two diering by the gauge variation n of a local counterterm and possibly a total derivative

dn1.

 by gauge invariant, we really mean invariant under gauge and local lorentz transformations. similarly,

the variation  designates both types of innitesimal transformations.

28

the relevant contributions to the gauge, gravitational and mixed anomalies due to the

dierent chiral elds in ten dimensions are given by the following invariant twelve-forms of the

gauge and lorentz curvatures:

(a.2)

where tr denotes as usual the trace over generators of the adjoint representation of the gauge

group: the gauge curvature two-form f has values in the adjoint representation. an additional

factor 1/2 must be included for majorana-weyl fermions, and opposite chiralities contribute

with opposite signs.

the one-loop anomaly generated by each of the s1/z2 xed planes includes an e8 gauge
(and mixed) contribution, and a gravitational contribution that is the half of what would be

expected in ten dimensions. this is because of the coupling of eleven-dimensional supergravity

to ten-dimensional elds [1]. a pragmatic way to understand this extra factor of one half is to

realise that, in the limit where the two xed planes coincide, the sum of the anomalies of the
two xed planes should reproduce the standard ten-dimensional e8  e8 anomaly. hence the
one-loop anomaly on the ith plane (i = 1, 2) for a general gauge group is

i12(1loop)i =

grav (r)(cid:17)

mixed(r, fi) + i (1/2)

gauge(fi)(cid:17) ,

(a.3)

where the overall factor of 1
2 is due to the majorana-weyl condition and the extra factor of
1
2 in the gravitational term has just been explained. the dimension of the gauge group on
the ith plane is denoted by ni. note that r is meant to be located on the ith plane. in the
following, we write ri to emphasize this fact. such an anomaly has a chance to be cancelled by

29

an appropriate green-schwarz mechanism only if this twelve-form factorises into a four-form
and an eight-form. for this to work the tr r6 term must vanish and the tr f 6 term must be
expressible entirely as a combination of tr f 4 tr f 2 and (tr f 2)3. the rst condition selects
ni = 248 while the only appropriate factorisation of tr f 6 is obtained if

tr f 6

i =

1

7200

(tr f 2

i )3,

tr f 4

i =

1
100

(tr f 2

i )2 .

(a.4)

these two conditions only hold for e8, which also has the required dimension ni = 248. the

presence of large integers in the coecients is due to the large value 30 of the quadratic dynkin

index for the adjoint representation of e8. expressions become nicer if one redenes the trace

as tr = 30 tr . one then arrives at the factorised form

i12(1loop)i =
i4,i =

x8,i =

(a.5)

one sees that each of the i12(1loop)i, i = 1, 2 is factorised. for the perturbative e8 e8
heterotic string the relevant polynomial is the sum i12(1loop)1 + i12(1loop)2. how can this
also be factorised? for the perturbative limit (weak coupling) the two xed planes coincide

and one should take the same value for r in both expressions. then the purely gravitational

x8 is the same and one gets

i12(1loop)1 + i12(1loop)2  (i4,1 + i4,2)x8 +

= (i4,1 + i4,2)hx8 +



3(cid:16)(i4,1)3 + (i4,2)3(cid:17)
3(cid:16)(i4,1)2 + (i4,2)2  i4,1i4,2(cid:17)i ,



(a.6)

which is factorised thanks to the trivial identity a3 + b3 = (a + b)(a2 + b2  ab). it is now
easy to rewrite this expression in term of traces over the representations of the product group
e8  e8 to recover the well-known expression of the anomaly for e8  e8 super yang-mills
coupled to n = 1 supergravity (heterotic string). but we do not need it here.

we have chosen the normalisation of the four-forms i4,i such that their integrals over a

four-cycle equal the integral characteristic class of the e8 bundle minus a quarter of the even

30

rst pontryagin class. more precisely, for any four-cycle c4 one has
