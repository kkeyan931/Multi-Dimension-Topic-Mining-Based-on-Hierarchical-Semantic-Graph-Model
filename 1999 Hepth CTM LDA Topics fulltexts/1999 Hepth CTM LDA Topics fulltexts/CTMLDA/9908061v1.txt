abstract.

we present a simple derivation of an upper bound on the aver-
age size of the true vacuum bubbles at the end of ination, in
models of extended ination type. the derivation uses the in-
equality that the total energy inside a given volume must be less
than its linear dimensions. the above bound is the same as that
obtained earlier, by applying the holographic principle according
to fischler-susskind prescription. such a bound leads to a lower
bound on the denisty uctuations.

holographic principle says, among other things, that the entropy in a
given volume is bounded by its surface area, measured in planck units. it is
based on the inequality

e < r

(1)

where e is the total energy inside a given volume, and r is its linear dimen-
sions. otherwise the system would lie within the schwarzschild radius, and
would collapse to form a black hole [1].

recently, fischler and susskind (fs) have a given a prescription for ap-
plying the holographic principle in cosmology [2]. applying fs prescription
during the inationary stage, we have obtained in an earlier work a lower
bound on the density uctuations [3].1 to our knowledge, this is the rst
instance where a lower bound on density uctuations has been obtained the-
oretically. in the explicit cases considered, this bound is remarkably close to
the observed value.

later, other prescriptions for applying the holographic principle in cos-
mology have been suggested [5]. however, none of them seems to lead to
a lower bound on the density uctuations. hence, the existence of such a
theoretical lower bound, important though it is, is in doubt.

in this note, we present a simple alternative derivation of this bound, us-
ing equation (1). the derivation is applicable to models of extended ination
type, where the ination is ended by the percolation of true vacuum bubbles
(and eventual reheating) [6].

in the following, we use planck units unless mentioned otherwise and,
for simplicity, omit numerical factors of order unity. let tb be the temper-
ature when the ination begins, and f  t 4
b be the false vacuum energy.
in extended ination type models, the true vacuum bubbles nucleate during
ination, expand with the speed of light, and eventually percolate the uni-
verse completely, thus ending the ination. (the bubble walls then collide
and reheat the universe to a temperature tr  tb.)

let d be the average size of the bubbles at the instant of complete perco-
lation and let   t 1
be the bubble wall thickness. (thicker bubble walls
will result in stronger bounds.) then, the energy e stored in the bubble is

e  d2 f  d2t 3

b .

1 fs prescription is said to be invalid during reheating, a non adiabatic process [4].
however, in [3], the fs prescription is applied only (soon) after the reheating, when the
entropy generation is complete.

before percolation is complete, the bubbles are expanding with the speed
of light, and are embedded in an inating universe. it seems unlikely that,
under these circumstances, the bubbles can collapse back to form black holes.
the inequality (1) may not then be applied. however, upon the completion
of percolation, the ination ends, the bubbles stop expanding, and are now
embedded in an expanding universe like ours. then, regions with sucient
amount of energy inside can collapse to form black holes. the inequality (1)
may then be applied.

applying (1) now gives the constraint

e < d  dt 3

b < 1 .

(3)

this constraint is same as that in [3], which was obtained by applying hol-
graphic principle according to fischler-susskind prescription. as explained
in [3] with explicit examples, an upper bound on d leads to (i) an upper bound
on the duration of ination; (ii) an upper bound on the ination factor; and
(iii) a lower bound on the density uctuations, 
 .

explicitly, in the case of extended ination with tb  1014gev and  
10, one gets 
o(107) (see [6, 7, 3] for details). this lower bound,

obtained theoretically, is remarkably close to the observed value  106 [8].
we conclude with two remarks. first, it is clear from the above derivation
that the violation of the bound (3) is likely to result in a copius production
of black holes. we are assuming implicitly that such is not the case. on the
other hand, it is perhaps of interest to study the consequences, cosmological
or otherwise, of such a copious black hole production. however, such a study
lies beyond the scope of the present work.

second, it is not clear if, and how, the above derivation can be extended
to models of new ination type, where the ination is ended by the inaton
rolling down the hill [9].
