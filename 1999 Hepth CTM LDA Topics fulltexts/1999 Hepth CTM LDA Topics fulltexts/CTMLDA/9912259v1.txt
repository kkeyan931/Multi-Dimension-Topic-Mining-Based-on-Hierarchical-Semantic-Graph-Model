abstract

the generalization of the black hole in three-dimensional space-
time to include an electric charge q in addition to the mass m
and the angular momentum j is given. the eld equations are
rst solved explicitly when q is small and the general form of the
eld at large distances is established. the total hairs m, j and
q are exhibited as boundary terms at innity. it is found that
the inner horizon of the rotating uncharged black hole is unstable
under the addition of a small electric charge. next it is shown
that when q = 0 the spinning black hole may be obtained from
the one with j = 0 by a lorentz boost in the   t plane. this
boost is an illegitimate coordinate transformation because it
changes the physical parameters of the solution. the extreme
black hole appears as the analog of a particle moving with the
speed of light. the same boost may be used when q 6= 0 to gen-
erate a solution with angular momentum from that with j = 0,

less transparent since in the charged case the black holes are not
obtained by identifying points in anti-de sitter space. the met-

ric is given explicitly in terms of three parameters, fm , eq and 

which are the rest mass and rest charge and the angular ve-
locity of the boost. these parameters are related to m, j and q
through the solution of an algebraic cubic equation. altogether,
even without angular momentum, the electrically charged 2+1
black hole is somewhat pathological since (i) it exists for arbi-
trarily negative values of the mass, and (ii) there is no upper
bound on the electric charge.

1 introduction

the black hole in three-dimensional spacetime [1, 2] has been the object of
considerable study [3]. however as pointed out by several authors [3], [4]
if one includes electric charge, the solution reported in the original article
[1] only applies when the angular momentum vanishes.
in this article we
analyze the case when all three hairs m, j and q are dierent from zero.
the work is organized as follows. section 2 presents the einstein-maxwell
action in hamiltonian form. the hamiltonian form is well suited for the
present analysis because it permits to identify directly the physical meaning
of the integration constants as the total charges and their conjugates. the
requirements of circular symmetry and time independence (stationarity) are
then imposed and the simplied equations applying in that case are written
down. the equations are a coupled set of rst order dierential equations.
if the electric charge is small the equations can be integrated directly. this
is done in sec. 3. a noteworthy fact is that the inner horizon of the rotating
uncharged black hole is unstable under the addition of a small electric charge.
section 4 begins by showing that when q = 0 the spinning black hole may
be obtained from the one with j = 0 by a lorentz boost in the   t plane.
this boost is an illegitimate coordinate transformation  because it changes
the physical parameters of the solution. the extreme black hole appears as
the analog of a particle moving with the speed of light. the same boost may
be used when q 6= 0 to generate a solution with angular momentum from
that with j = 0, although the geometrical meaning of the transformation
is much less transparent since in that case the black holes are not obtained
by identifying points in anti-de sitter space. the metric is given explicitly

in terms of three parameters, fm, eq and  which are the rest mass and

rest charge and the angular velocity of the boost. these parameters are
related to m, j and q through the solution of an algebraic cubic equation.
altogether, even without angular momentum, the electrically charged 2+1
black hole is somewhat pathological since (i) it exists for arbitrarily negative
values of the mass, and (ii) there is no upper bound on the electric charge1.

1 as it was observed in [5], the lack of a lower bound for the mass prevents charged

black holes from being supersymmetric.

and the magnetic density b is given by

fij = ijb .

we will use units such that the gravitational constant  = 8g, which has
dimensions of an inverse mass, is set equal to 1

is negative and is related to the cosmological length l by  = l2. this
length will be set equal to unity.

2.2 rotational symmetry and time independence

if one requires invariance under spatial rotations and time translations, the
metric may be cast in the form

ds2 = n 2(r)f 2(r)dt2 + f 2(r)dr2 + r2(d + n (r)dt)2,

this implies that the only non-vanishing component of the gravitational mo-
mentum is given by

the only non-vanishing electromagnetic strengths are

e r = q ,

b = ra .

(11)

equation (10) follows from solving the constraint g = 0, whereas e  = 0
follows from hr = 0. to arrive at (11) one uses the radial gauge ar = 0.
in terms of the remaining elds, which are only functions of r, the action
reads

3 solutions in special cases and physical

meaning of integration constants

equation (19) can be solved for b with an appropriate integration constant
which is xed by regularity and is not an independent free parameter [see
eq. (49) below]. the integration constants for f 2 and p can be expressed
in terms of the mass m and the angular momentum j. thus, together with
the electromagnetic eld, the solution is characterized by the charges m, j,
q and their conjugates n(), n () and a0() (chemical potentials in
the euclidean formulation).
the system of rst order nonlinear dierential equations (15-18) is not
straightforward to solve for f 2, p, n and n , when q 6= 0. it is therefore
useful to analyze special cases and approximations in order to gain insight
into the properties of the solution.

we rst turn our attention to the two limiting cases when the solution is
known in closed form. these are q = 0, j 6= 0, m 6= 0 (the standard 2+1
black hole) and q 6= 0, j = 0, m 6= 0 (charged black hole without angular
momentum).

3.1 j 6= 0, q = 0

if one varies the reduced action (12) one picks up a surface term [10]

(t2  t1)2[f 2()n()  2p()n ()] ,

(24)

which identies f 2() = m and p() = j/2. in order to have a black
hole for m  0 one adjusts the zero of the energy so that m is indeed the
mass. in the same manner, in order to have a static black hole for j = 0 one
takes j as the total angular momentum. similarly with the electric charge,
which is identied with the integration constant q appearing in (12) because
its variation in the action (2) multiplies a0().
given by

the function f 2 has zeros at r+ and r, the outer and inner horizons,

and coalesce if j = m (extreme case).

note that if j  0 (m xed) the root r tends to r = 0 which is
considered as a (chronological) singularity [2]. note also that when j = 0,
f 2 = 0 has only one root r = r+. thus the limit of the root r (which is
zero) is not a root of the limit of f 2. in this sense the limit is discontinuous.
this discontinuous behavior shows itself in the graph of f 2 as a function of
r. the minimum of f 2 occurs at r2
2 )2 whereas the value of f 2 at the
minimum is f 2
min = m for all j. thus when j  0 the whole branch of
f 2 to the left of the minimum disappears. we shall see similar behaviors for
j = 0, q 6= 0 and j 6= 0, q 6= 0.

min = ( j

(32)

which diverges if r  .

(33)

(34)

(35)

and the second term vanishes when r  r0.
one might call m(r0) the energy within the radius r0. it diers from
m by  1
2q2 ln r0 which may be thought of as the electrostatic energy outside
r0 up to an (innite) constant which is absorbed in m(r0). the sum (34) is
then independent of r0, nite and equal to the total mass.

thus in practice one does not bring in r0 and writes

 lim
r

(q2 ln r) = 0  .

(36)

a similar situation occurs in four spacetime dimensions. one may write

the reissner-nordstrom g00 as 1 2m (r0)
r  1
2r0
is the total mass, independent of r0, and q2
is the electrostatic energy outside
2r0
a sphere of radius r0. in this case it is not necessary to include an innite
constant in m(r0) since q2

vanishes when r0  .

the function f 2 given by (28) tends to positive innity if r  0 or if
r  . it has a minimum at r = |q|/2. the value of f 2 at the minimum is

 m +(cid:18)q

2(cid:19)2"1  ln(cid:18)q

2(cid:19)2# .

(37)

if (37) is negative there are two zeros of f 2, r+ and r.
if (37) vanishes
the two roots coincide and one has an extreme black hole. the situation is
illustrated in fig. 1.

figure 1: region in the mass-charge plane for which there are black holes. black

holes exist whenever m (cid:16) q

2(cid:17)2(cid:20)1  ln(cid:16) q

2(cid:17)2(cid:21)  0. this corresponds to the shaded

area in the diagram. extremal black holes are at the boundary between the shaded
and unshaded areas. note that if the electric charge is large enough black hole
solutions exist for arbitrarily negative values of the mass.

2(cid:17)2(cid:20)1  ln(cid:16) q

2(cid:17)2(cid:21) vanishes at q = 0, has a maximum

if 0 < m < 1 there are two branches q2  q2

. this means that if m > 1 there are always two roots

one sees that if the electric charge is large enough black hole solutions
exist even for negative values of the mass. this feature is in sharp contrast
with what happens in 3 + 1 dimensions and makes the electrically charged
2 + 1 black hole somewhat pathological.

lastly, consider the limit q  0. the situation is analogous to the limit
j  0 discussed at the end of sec. (3.1). now one has r2
and
f 2
min  m so that, again, the whole ascending branch to the left of the
minimum disappears in the limit q  0. note that r approaches zero as
r  e2m/q2.
3.3 m 6= 0, j 6= 0, q 6= 0 small

min = (cid:16) q
2(cid:17)2

one can solve equations (15)(19) perturbatively for small q. this is of
interest because the solution for small q captures the behavior at large dis-
tances for a generic q, and also because it gives insight into the properties
of horizons.

we start with expressions (20)(23) which we will denote with a subscript
zero (unperturbed) and add to them corrections of order q2. one has
b0 = 0. the equations for the perturbation then read

these equations must be integrated demanding that n(), n (), m

and j be unchanged. thus we should ask

n() = 0 , n () = 0 .

and also demand that p(r) and f 2 should vanish as r  , up to log-
arithmic terms multiplied by q2, which are not considered when identifying

10

j and m by the reasoning of section 3.2. the integration constant in (42)
is xed by a regularity requirement as discussed below.

here r+ and r are those of the unperturbed solution. note that when j = 0
(r = 0) the results go over into the exact expressions found in the previous
subsection.

the integration constant in (42) has been chosen so that the magnetic

eld referred to an orthonormal basis,

b = fr  = g1/2b =

(48)

is regular at the (outer) horizon r+. indeed, (47) is equivalent to writing

b(r) =

(49)

note that, as a consequence, b(r+) = 0.

(50)

the solution given by (43-47) is singular at r. this means that the inner
horizon of the rotating uncharged black hole is unstable under the addition
of a small electric charge.

4 exact solution with m 6= 0, j 6= 0, q 6= 0

the system of ordinary, coupled, non-linear, rst order dierential equations
(15-19) appears not to be tractable directly. however one may nd the
solution by means of an illegitimate coordinate transformation. in this case
illegitimate means a transformation that does not preserve the periodicity
of the angular variable and also changes the range of the radial variable.
as a consequence of the change in periodicity, the casimir invariants of the
symmetry group at innity are changed.

generating new solutions from old ones by means of coordinate trans-
formations which are illegitimate in some intermediate step, but lead to a
sensible answer, is a procedure that has been quite useful in general relativity
although there appears to be no general rationale behind it.

for a conical singularity in three spacetime dimensions, the idea of bring-
ing in angular momentum through an illegitimate coordinate transformation
was used in rfes.
[6, 7, 8]. in [9] the procedure was used to generate the
uncharged rotating black hole metric (with a transformation not quite the
same as the one used here), but was not carried out properly for the charged
case.

4.1 rotating solution with q = 0 revisited
in this case one knows that the black holes with j = 0 and j 6= 0 are both
obtained by identications of anti-de sitter space as discussed in [2]. there-
fore, if one forgets the identications there exists a coordinate transformation
that takes the standard form of the black hole line element with j = 0 onto
the one with j 6= 0. it ios given by

r

12

this transformation may be obtained by composing the transformations
that relate each of these black holes to the standard form of the anti-de
sitter line element and which are given by eq. (3.29) of [2]. the individual
transformations and also their composition change the functional form of
the anti-de sitter line element and therefore do not belong to the so(2, 2)
symmetry group of anti-de sitter space.

here we have denoted by (r, e,et) and (r, , t) the standard coordinates
for the non rotating and rotating cases respectively. to obtain the rotating
black hole one must demand that  be periodic with period 2 and also that
0  r2 < . as already anticipated, these requirements are incompatible
with e having period 2 and 0  r2 < . it is important to realize that the
outer horizon is the image r+ of the unique horizon that the non rotating
+ = fm . on the other hand, the inner horizon comes in
black hole has at r2
because the jacobian factor dr/dr vanishes at r = 0, whose image is r.

now, the transformation (51,52,53) has more freedom than what we need
because it takes a non-rotating black hole with a given mass onto the most
general black hole. it suces for our needs to be able to endow a given black
hole with angular momentum, much as one endows a particle with linear
momentum by means of a boost. this analogy is quite appropriate, indeed
if we write

  r
r+!2

r+
r+

= 2  1
1

= 

,

(54)

(55)

1  2

we see that (51,52) is the product of a lorentz boost and a conformal rescaling
of , t. one may set

 = 1

(56)

by rescaling the radial variable r and the parameters r and r+ by factor
, and we shall do so. therefore we will take as our rotation boost the
transformation

(57)

(58)

supplemented by the change of the radial coordinate

(59)

the reason for adopting this particular way of eliminating one of the
redundant parameters in (51,52) (rather than, say, setting r+/r+ = 1) is,
basically, that it simplies considerably the analysis for the charged case. on
less pragmatic grounds, taking (51,52) to be just a lorentz boost is appealing
because it captures distinctly the limiting nature of the extreme black hole
which appears as the analogue of a zero mass particle.

indeed, one may rewrite (54) and (55) as

r+ =

r =

r+

r+

q(1  2)
q(1  2)

.

thus we see that (r+,r) transforms as a vector under the boost and r+ =

fm 1/2 plays the role of the rest mass. the extreme black hole corresponds to
the limit 2  1, fm  0, keeping r2

the corresponding transformation formulas for the mass and the angular

+ = fm /(1  2) nite.

momentum read

m = fm (1 + 2)/(1  2),
j = 2fm/(1  2).

(60)

(61)

recall that m and j are precisely the casimir invariants associated with
the identication which produces the black hole out of anti-de sitter space [2].
it follows from (60) and (61) that each of these casimir invariants separately
changes under the boost; however, the combination m 2  j 2 = r4
+ remains
unchanged.

4.2 charged case

when q 6= 0, the black hole is not obtained through identications of points
in anti-de sitter space or in another universal space. therefore the reasoning

14

acompanying equations (51)-(53) no longer applies. nevertheless, we will
again bring in angular momentum through the rotation boost (58) supple-
mented by a change of the radial coordinate which will be a generalization of
(59) and which we will derive below. the procedure will of course produce a
solution of the eld equations since one is performing a change of coordinates.
that the solution is a charged rotating black hole will follow from verifying
that the asymptotic conditions (43-47) are met and because it will have the
appropriate horizon structure.

we start from a line element of the form,

ds2 = f 2(r)dt2 + f 2(r)dr2 + r2d 2,

and apply the boost (58) to it to obtain

ds2 = n 2f 2dt2 + f 2dr2 + r2(d + n dt)2.

the graph of r2 as a function of r2 given by (69) is shown in figure 2. one
sees that the function has two branches separated by a singularity in the form
of an innite throat at r2 = 0. the black hole space corresponds to the piece
to the right of the throat for which r2  0. in the limit q  0 the left and
right sides of the throat annihilate each other and the two branches merge on
the segmented straight line. the inner horizon of the uncharged black hole
corresponds to the intersection of the straight line and the horizontal axis,
which occurs at a negative value of r2. when the electric charge is turned
on, the throat comes in and the old inner horizon becomes thus disconnected
from the black hole space, while a new inner horizon appears in the black
hole space. this is the origin of the perturbative instability of the inner

horizon found in section 3. both the outer and inner horizons of the charged
rotating black hole come from the corresponding ones of the original charged
black hole with j = 0. they are the images under the boost of the zeros r+
r of f 2. unlike what happens in the uncharged case, the jacobian dr/dr in
(73) is dierent from zero and does not bring in new zeros of f 2.

figure 2: r2 as a function of r2. the black hole space corresponds to the piece
to the right of the throat for which r2  0.
in the limit q  0 the left and
right sides of the throat annihilate each other and the two branches merge on the
segmented straight line. the separation between the solid and the segmented line
behaves asymptotically as 2
4 ln r2. the inner horizon of the uncharged black
hole corresponds to the intersection of the straight line and the horizontal axis,
which occurs at a negative value of r2. when the electric charge is turned on, the
throat comes in and the old inner horizon becomes thus disconnected from the
black hole space, while a new inner horizon appears in the black hole space. this
is the origin of the perturbative instability of the inner horizon.

4.3 asymptotic form

we now verify that the rotating solution has the correct asymptotic form and

relate the parameters fm , eq to m , q and j, the actual mass, charge and angular

momentum of the charged rotating solution.

now, for a black hole one wants to express the metric in terms of the charges at

periodicity of  under the boost, which changes the region of integration of the
charge density.

it may seem surprising that q diers from eq. this comes from the change in the
innity (hairs). to this end, one should solve eqs. (81)(82)(83) to express fm , eq
and  as functions of m , q,and j. if one can do this, the rest mass fm (m, q, j)
and rest charge eq(m, q, j) are by construction invariants under the boost, and
generalize the fm of the case without charge, whereas (m, q, j) is the velocity

expressed in terms of the momentum.

to gain insight into this equation it is useful to consider the case q = 0 which
may be rewritten as

the solution of this equation, which satises 2 < 1, is

if the solution (86) is inserted back in the original equations eqs. (60), (61),

fm = sgnmpm 2  j 2.

we see, therefore, two points of interest. they are: (i) a real , with 2 < 1,

m 2 > j 2. (ii) even when 2 < 1 exists, the solution is not necessarily a black

when q 6= 0, one expects to face the same situation. there will be a certain
region in the space of parameters m , j and q (actually, only the two independent
combinations m

will be able to express fm and eq as functions of m , j and q and the solution will
be a black hole when fm and eq obey the additional restrictions described in figure

1. it does not seem to be possible to exhibit explicitly the necessary and sucient
condition for m , j and q to be such that the cubic equation (84) admits a unique
real solution 2 < 1. the best we have been able to do is to show by analyzing
the graph of the cubic, that a sucient, but not necessary conditions are m 2 > j 2
and m  q2
4 > 0. it is also straightforward to show that under these conditions j
