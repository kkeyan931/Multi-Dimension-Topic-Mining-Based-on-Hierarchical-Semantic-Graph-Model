abstract

we establish a direct correspondence between certain higher-rank p-form chern-simons

topological type theories in the bulk of a manifold with boundary and particular sectors

of supergravity models on the boundary, provided that certain boundary conditions are

satised. the cases we investigate include eleven-dimensional supergravity and both of the

type ii theories in ten dimensions.

introduction

superstring models and their low-energy supergravity limits are among the most complex

and exciting of physical theories, and they are also among the most promising as far as

phenomenological expectations are concerned. even though so far no concrete predictions

have been made, the intrinsic mathematical consistency and beauty of these theoretical

constructions have been attracting much attention.

in this paper we will uncover one

more rather interesting aspect of the mathematical conspiracies that make these theories

so unique. it is well known that symmetries play an important role in all physical theories.

it is a simple observation that if one is able to devise a formulation where these symmetry

properties are manifest, then previously hidden aspects of the theory can become more

transparent.

in this paper we shall demonstrate that there is a direct relation between certain un-

usual chern-simons (cs) type theories in higher-dimensional spacetimes with boundaries

and particular sectors of supergravity models on the boundary of the spacetime. in order to

make this relation explicit shall develop a certain rst-order formalism. an almost identical

approach, called the doubled-eld formalism, has been used in the past [6] to unify the

duality symmetries and gauge invariances of supergravity theories, and later on the formal-

ism has been successfully applied to obtain certain, rather general, relations among p-brane

tensions [7]. however, to prevent a confusion, we should emphasize that the approach used

in this paper is not identical to that introduced in [6]. for instance, our denitions for the

eld-strengths are dierent, and all elds in the theory are put on an equal footing, including

the dilatons. as for the general structure, it is strikingly reminiscent of the situation in an

ordinary cs-theory in a three-dimensional spacetime with boundary, where it is well known

that in the bulk the theory is topological, and all the dynamics takes place only on the

boundary, where the degrees of freedom are described by the chiral wess-zumino-witten-

novikov (wzwn) model [1]. however, now the cs-theories are replaced by some higher

p-form analogs, and instead of a wzwn-model we obtain various supergravity theories.

boundary conditions play a rather important role in the construction [25]. one needs to

impose these conditions in order for the variational principle to make sense, and to maintain

gauge invariance in the theory on a manifold with boundary. the cs-type theories we obtain

have much in common with the so-called higher-rank bf theories [911], although in our

approach these theories acquire a non-abelian generalization. even though many issues have

been left unaddressed, the results obtained may indicate that there are hidden topological

sectors in supergravity theories, or even that these theories may be described by pure

1

topological models on manifolds with boundaries. it is also conceivable that the topological

theories we describe may have applications of their own, related to some properties of

higher-dimensional manifolds without boundaries [8]. however, the fact that these models

preserve metric-independence after quantization still remains to be proved.

2 d=11 supergravity

in this section we shall consider the example of d = 11 supergravity. it is a simplest case

possible, however it already includes many characteristic features. we would like to start

with the following lagrangian in d = 12

l = 1

2 (a(4)  da(7) + a(7)  da(4)) + 1

6 a(4)  a(4)  a(4),

(2.1)

where a(4) and a(7) are four-form and seven-form gauge elds.

it is easy to see that this lagrangian changes by total derivative under the following

gauge transformations

a(4) = d(3),

a(7) = (3)  a(4) + d(6),

where (3) and (6) are arbitrary three-forms and six-forms.

in fact

l = 1

2 d(d(3)  a(7)  d(6)  a(4)).

the following brackets hold

{(1

(3)), (2

(3))} = (2

(3)  1

(3)),

{(1

(3)), (2

(6))} = 0

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

if the manifold has no boundary, the action obtained by integrating this lagrangian over

the whole spacetime is invariant with respect to these gauge transformations. in fact the

lagrangian (2.1) can be obtained by following the canonical procedure for cs-theories. let

us dene the following eld-strengths

f(5) = da(4),

f(8) = da(7) + 1

2 a(4)  a(4).

(2.5)

it can be checked that under the gauge transformations (2.2) elds (2.5) transform covari-

antly

f(5) = 0,

f(8) = (3)  f(5).

2

(2.6)

out of these eld-strengths one can construct the analog of the chern class

f(5)  f(8).

(2.7)

it is easy to see that the class (2.7) is invariant with respect to the gauge transformations

(2.2), and also that the following identity holds

f(5)  f(8) = d( 1

2 (a(4)  da(7) + a(7)  da(4)) + 1

6 a(4)  a(4)  a(4)) = dl.

(2.8)

thus everything is very reminiscent of ordinary chern-simons theory, and what we have

said so far, with the exception of gauge invariance, is valid whether we have a boundary

or not. in the presence of a boundary, things change in a rather interesting way. first of

all, it seems that the theory is no longer gauge invariant, due to the total derivative which,

upon integration, gives rise to a non-vanishing term on the boundary. however, we know

how to deal with this problem. the solution again comes from the conventional cs-theory,

where the same problem arises; one imposes some boundary conditions in order to restore

gauge invariance [25]. the trivial condition that the gauge transformations vanish on the

boundary is not interesting, since it appears to be too strong. the only other choice is to

impose the following relations

d(3) = d(6)|m12 ,

a(7) = a(4)|m12 ,

(2.9)

where the hodge  is taken with respect to the eleven-dimensional metric on the boundary.

if the relations (2.9) hold then the boundary term vanishes, and gauge invariance is restored.

it can also be checked that the variational principle is well dened in this case. normally, if

there is a boundary and the lagrangian changes by a total derivative, problems may arise

owing to the fact that the functional derivative is not well dened unless one adds some

extra terms on the boundary to cancel terms coming from the bulk. in our situation the

boundary contribution from the bulk has the form

z l = 1

2zm12

(a(4)  a(7)  a(7)  a(4)),

(2.10)

and it vanishes if boundary conditions (2.9) are satised.

this is not the end of story though. the action of twelve-dimensional theory (2.1) can

be written as

s = zm12
= zm12

1

2 a(4)  a(7) +zm12
2 a(4)  a(4) +zm12

1

3

(a(7)  da(4) + 1

6 a(4)  a(4)  a(4))

(2.11)

(a(7)  da(4) + 1

6 a(4)  a(4)  a(4)),

where in the second line we used the boundary conditions introduced in (2.9).

now, variation of the a(7)-eld (which simply plays the role of a constraint) in the

bulk gives the condition da(4) = 0, which implies that (at least locally) a(4) = da(3), and

by continuation the same must be true on the boundary. thus if one substitutes this

relation back into the lagrangian the result is a theory on the boundary whose lagrangian

is identical to the one for d = 11 supergravity (without einstein-hilbert term). there are

also some subtleties with the gauge symmetry of the theory. the generators are simply

constraints coming from the variation over the components of a(4) and a(7) gauge elds

with a time index, since these have no conjugate momenta. they are

gm((6)) =zm11

(6)  da(4),

ge((3)) =zm11

(3)  (da(7) + 1

2 a(4)  a(4)),

(2.12)

where (3) and (6) are arbitrary three-forms and six-forms, and the integration is over only

the spatial coordinates.

all states in the theory must satisfy the constraints ge| i = 0, and gm| i = 0. if there

is no boundary, the algebra of these constraints can be easily calculated using the fact that

the a(4) and a(7) elds are canonically conjugate to each other. the algebra gives rise to

the following brackets

{ge(1

(3)), ge(2

(3))} = gm(1

(3)  2

(3)),

{ge(1

(3)), gm(2

(6))} = 0.

(2.13)

however, if the spacetime has a boundary, one runs into a problem. functional derivatives

of the constraints are not well dened, and one needs to add some boundary terms to

the generators to cancel these contributions, and these extra terms will play the role of

boundary symmetries. namely one needs to add gm = rm11
ge = rm11
(modied) ge and gm generators changes, becoming {ge((3)), gm((6))} = rm11

(3)  a(7) = rm11

d(6). after we have imposed the constraints ge| i = 0, and gm| i = 0 the gauge symmetry

(3)  a(4) to ge, and also the commutator between the

(6)  a(4) to gm, and

(3) 

in the bulk therefore gives rise to the symmetry of a theory on the boundary

{ge(1

(3)), ge(2

(3))} = gm(1

(3)  2

(3)),

{ge((3)), gm((6))} =zm11

(3)  d(6).

(2.14)

a similar idea has been employed in cs-theory in d = 3, where it gave rise to certain

conformal models on the boundary with ane symmetries [35].

as a nontrivial consistency check one can verify that jacobi-identity is satised. the

only interesting one is

4

{ge(1

(3)), {ge(2

(3)), ge(3

(3))}} + {ge(3

(3)), {ge(1

(3)), ge(2

(3))}} +

{ge(2

d(1

(3)) = 0.

3 type iia-theory in d=10

now we would like to consider the case of the type iia theory in d = 10. here things are

sightly more complicated, owing to the increase in the number of elds, but main ideas stay

the same. the ten-dimensional lagrangian has the form

l10 = r1l  1

2 d  d  1
2 e

3
2

 f (2)  f(2)  1

2 e f (3)  f(3)

1

 1

2 e

2  f (4)  f(4)  1

2 da(3)  da(3)  a(2) ,

(3.1)

where f(4) = da(3)  da(2)  a(1), f(3) = da(2) and f(2) = da(1). from this, it follows that

the equations of motion for the antisymmetric tensor and scalar elds are:

d(e

1

2  f (4)) = f(4)  f(3) .

d(e f (3)) = f(2)  (e

2 f (4))  1

2 f(4)  f(4) ,

1

d(e

3

2  f (2)) = f(3)  (e

1

2  f (4)) ,

dd =  1

4 f(4)  (e

1

2  f (4))  1

2 f(3)  (e f (3))  3

4 f(2)  (e

(3.2)

3

2  f (2)) .

let us make the following redenitions

1

4 f(4) = b(4),

e

e 1

2 f(3) = b(3),

3

4 f(2) = b(2),

e

d = b(1),

(3.3)

and introduce the following new elds

b(6) = b (4),

b(7) = b (3),

b(8) = b(2),

b(9) = b (1).

(3.4)

in terms of these new elds equations (3.2) can be written as follows

h(2) = db(1) = 0,

h(3) = db(2)  3

4 b(1)  b(2) = 0,

h(4) = db(3) + 1

2 b(1)  b(3) = 0,

5

(3.5)

h(5) = db(4)  1

4 b(1)  b(4)  b(3)  b(2) = 0,

h(7) = db(6) + 1

4 b(1)  b(6) + b(4)  b(3) = 0,

h(8) = db(7)  1

2 b(1)  b(7) + b(2)  b(6) + 1

2 b(4)  b(4) = 0,

h(9) = db(8) + 3

4 b(1)  b(8) + b(3)  b(6) = 0,

h(10) = db(9) + 1

4 b(4)  b(6) + 1

2 b(3)  b(7) + 3

4 b(2)  b(8) = 0,

where we have also introduced new eld-strengths h(2), h(3), h(4), h(5), h(7), h(8), h(9), and

h(10).

at this stage we would like to emphasize that there is a one-to-one correspondence

between original equations of motion (3.2) and the system (3.5), provided that relations

(3.4) are satised. indeed, one can solve for b(1) rst (locally), and then for b(2), b(3), and

b(4), and after that, using relations (3.4) for b(6), b(7), b(8), and b(9), so eventually one

recovers the original system (3.2).

it turns out that the system (3.5) is invariant under the following gauge transformations

b(1) = d,

(3.6)

b(2) = d(1) + 3

4 (1)  b(1) + 3

4 b(2),

b(3) = d(2) + 1

2 (2)  b(1)  1

2 b(3),

b(4) = d(3) + 1

4 (3)  b(1) + (2)  b(2) + (1)  b(3) + 1

2 b(4),

b(6) = d5  1

4 5  b(1)  (3)  b(3)  (2)  b(4)  1

4 b(6),

b(7) = d(6)  1

2 (6)  b(1)  5  b(2)  (3)  b(4)  (1)  b(6) + 1

2 b(7),

b(8) = d(7)  3

4 (7)  b(1)  5  b(3)  (2)  b(6)  3

4 b(8),

b(9) = d(8)  3

4 (7)  b(2) + 1

2 (6)  b(3)  1

4 5  b(4)

 1

4 (3)  b(6)  1

2 (2)  b(7)  3

4 (1)  b(8),

where , (1), (2), (3), 5, (6), (7), and (8) are arbitrary p-forms of the appropriate degree.

this is actually an innitesimal form of the transformations, but it is good enough for our

purposes. another way to say that transformations (3.6) leave the system (3.5) invariant

is to claim that eld-strengths hi transform covariantly, namely that they transform into

each other, which can be checked by a direct calculation. now we would like to apply the

same idea as we did in d = 11 supergravity to the type iia theory. let us consider the

following lagrangian in eleven-dimensional spacetime

6

l = 1

2 (b(6)  db(4)  b(4)  db(6))  1

2 (b(3)  db(7) + b(7)  db(3))

(3.7)

+ 1

2 (b(8)  db(2)  b(2)  db(8))  1

2 (b(1)  db(9) + b(1)  db(9))

 1

4 b(6)  b(1)  b(4)  b(6)  b(3)  b(2)  1

2 b(7)  b(1)  b(3)

 3

4 b(8)  b(1)  b(2)  1

2 b(4)  b(4)  b(3).

as a nice consistency check, one can derive the following formal identity

dl = h(7)  h(5)  h(10)  h(2)  h(8)  h(4),

(3.8)

where we are using the denitions (3.5). again it is evident that the lagrangian (3.7) can

be obtained from the descent process from a thirteen-dimensional spacetime.

first of all under the gauge transformations (3.6) the lagrangian (3.7) transforms as a

total derivative; for example the  and (8) transformations give rise to the following term

l = 1

2 d(d(8)  b(1) + db(9)).

(3.9)

all other transformations produce similar results, namely it is always a sum of two terms

each of which is a wedge product of the derivative of a gauge parameter and a eld of

complementary degree.

therefore if there is no boundary in the eleven-dimensional spacetime we have gauge

invariance; otherwise it is lost. of course, we can restore gauge invariance by imposing

appropriate boundary conditions on the elds and gauge parameters. not too surprisingly,

they turn out to be the same as equations (3.4), plus corresponding conditions for the gauge-

parameters, namely d(8) = d, d(7) = d(1), and so on. also following the procedure

described in the second section, namely through integrating certain terms by parts, we get

the action in eleven-dimensional bulk plus boundary terms

(b (4)  b(4) + b (3)  b(3) + b (2)  b(2) + b (1)  b(1))

(3.10)

s =  1

2zm11

+ zm11

2 b(7)  b(1)  b(3)

 3

4 b(8)  b(1)  b(2)  1

2 b(4)  b(4)  b(3)).

now, let us evaluate the equations of motion for b(9), b(8), b(7), and b(6) in the bulk, which

imply that the rest of the elds are pure gauge (everywhere, including the boundary). after

integrating some terms by parts, we obtain a lagrangian on the boundary identical to the

7

one for the type iia theory in d = 10, where pure gauge degrees of freedom from the

bulk become dynamical. we should remark that presumably this procedure can be carried

out even at the quantum (functional integral) level, since the b(9), b(8), b(7), and b(6) elds

simply play the role of lagrange multipliers. thus the integrations over these elds produce

delta-functions which impose that the b(1), b(2), b(3), and b(4) gauge elds are at, or pure

gauge. the associated redenitions of variables may give rise to non-trivial jacobians in the

functional integral measure, and in turn may produce some dynamics for the metric on the

boundary. it is very tempting to conjecture that these jacobians will eventually produce an

einstein-hilbert curvature term on the boundary, and that the theory we are describing is

all that is needed to produce the complete supergravity action on the boundary, including

gravity. clearly these issues require a more careful investigation.

4 type iib-theory in d=10

there is no covariant lagrangian for type iib supergravity, since it includes a self-dual

5-form eld strength. however one can write down covariant equations of motion. in order

to make manifest their global sl(2, ir) symmetry, it is useful rst to assemble the dilaton

 and axion  into a 2  2 matrix:

m =  e

 e

 e

e + 2 e!

also, dene the sl(2, ir)-invariant matrix

1

 =  0

1 0! ,

and the two-component column vector of 2-form potentials

a(2) =  a1

(2)
a2

(2)! .

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

here a1

(2) is the r-r potential, and a2
tions of motion can then be written as

(2) is the ns-ns potential. the bosonic matter equa-

d(mh (3)) = h(5)   h(3) ,

now let us dene the following new elds

c 1

c 2

(9) = c 2

(1),

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

where we are also assuming that c(5) = c (5)

it turns out that in terms of these elds the system (4.4) can be written as follows

g1

(2) = dc 1

(4.8)

where we have also introduced corresponding eld-strengths gi

again we would like to emphasize that the system (4.8) is completely equivalent to the

original set of equations (4.4) provided that conditions (4.7) are satised.

one can easily check that this new system is invariant with respect to the following

gauge transformations

now one has to go through the same sequence of steps, and observe that under the symmetry

(4.9) this lagrangian changes by a total derivative, so that if there is a boundary then

gauge invariance is broken. to restore the symmetry one needs to impose some boundary

conditions, and of course, not too surprisingly, they turn out to be the same as equations

(4.7), including the self-duality constraint for 5-form eld-strength, plus the similar relations

for gauge-parameters. let us just demonstrate how this comes about for the 5-form. under

the symmetry c(5) = d(4) the action transforms as follows

s =zm11

l = 1

2zm11

d(4)  c(5)

(4.11)

now if we impose the conditions c(5) = c (5) and d(4) = d(4) then remarkably this term

vanishes, by virtue of the lorentzian metric signature. again one can easily check that the

theory lives on the boundary only, where it coincides with d = 10 type iib-theory (without

gravity, of course). in order to demonstrate this one needs to write out the action for the

lagrangian (4.10) in such a form that the bulk part does not have terms where the c i

9 and

c i

7 elds are covered by derivatives. they will therefore play the role of bulk lagrange

multipliers which impose certain constraints on the rest of the elds, plus boundary terms

with appropriate boundary conditions to have gauge invariance. after integrating out the

c i

9 and c i

7 elds in the bulk and solving constraints they impose, and integrating certain

terms by parts, one derives the type iib action together with the extra equations for c(5).
