(such congurations exist.) point, however, have, priori, reason prefer o(10) so(10) spin(10) p in(10)  lie groups lie algebra. analogy riemannian geometry appears break down. advent string theories , however, changed situation. theories severely constrained fact dictate precise global structures gauge groups. case e8 e8 heterotic theory, gauge group 2 (e8 e8) z2, denotes semi-direct product, z2 acts exchanging two e8 factors. (see, example, ref.  discussion signicance z2.) thus, gauge group disconnected, property analogous orientability must considered. however, e8 e8 simply connected, analogue spin structures here. contrast, full gauge group so(32) heterotic theory group usually denoted spin(32)/z2. unlike e8 e8 (and so(32)) group outer automorphism, {$9906059$} non-trivial disconnected version; thus, questions orientability arise here. however, spin(32)/z2 obviously simply connected, possible non-existence spin structures issue . see, then, two heterotic string theories require us consider consequences topologically non-trivial gauge groups. two theories appear, however, behave opposite ways, one gauge group disconnected simply connected identity component, connected simply connected. appearances deceptive is, course, lesson duality revolution . objective work understand role two specic kinds topological non-triviality maintaining (or obstructing) t-duality two heterotic string theories. (note that, throughout work, interpret t- duality broad sense. mapping gauge matter elds one heterotic theory called t-duality here.) two heterotic theories have, course , dierent gauge groups, groups lead, above, dierent topological complications. two lie algebras, however, much common : particular, common maximal, maximal-rank subalgebra isomorphic algebra so(16) so(16). -duality two heterotic theories established (e8 e8) z2 spin(32)/z2 congurations group broken common so(16) so(16) sub- group. problem here, pointed ref.{$9906059$}, common subgroup exist two so(16) so(16) algebras exponentiate completely dierent 3 subgroups.  z2 (e8 e8) z2  z2 spin(32)/z2, where, cases, semidirect product z2 dened exchange two local factors. notice subgroups certainly closely related original pair : lie algebra, two connected components, z2 z2 fundamental group identity component; isomorphic. however, also shown ref. {$9906059$} common double cover, crucially universal cover. - duality, therefore, established level. assumes, however, relevant gauge congurations obtained breaking (e8 e8) z2 spin(32)/z2 indeed lifted common double cover. this, again, involves gauge-theoretic analogue question existence spin structures. clearly, full understanding -duality require analysis theory gauge spinors groups. also useful concrete examples (e8 e8) z2 spin(32)/z2 congurations subgroups lift double cover : cases -duality topologically obstructed. begin general analysis problem comparing two distinct gauge theories given manifold. turn details specic groups involved string theory, giving general formulation topological aspects -duality. conclude several simple concrete examples show necessary take certain obstructions account discussing -duality topologically non-trivial space-times. 2. gauge groups common subgroups. let g1 g2 compact lie groups proper compact subgroup isomorphic h. (for present, assume isomorphisms 4 global; shall consider local case below.) -duality involves, among things, process comparing exchanging gauge matter elds associated two dierent gauge groups. entirely clear notion means global point view, however. gauge matter elds associated g1 essentially dened space-time , rather principal g1 bre bundle p1 , similarly g2. evidently make sense general speak comparing elds p1 elds p2; make sense it, must exploit common subgroup h. let us begin principal g1 bundle p1 reduces h-subbundle q. (notice condition p1, condition restrictive smaller h : extreme case h = {identity}, p1 must trivial. thus following construction satisfactory h maximal g1 g2.) now, h also subgroup g2, acts q g2 h h : (q, g2) (qh, h1g2), dene p2 = (q g2)/h. p2 admits natural action right g2, p2/g2 = , one show  p2 principal g2-bundle . thus g1-bundle reduces h dene g2 bundle natural way. let gi lie algebra gi let h algebra h. since h assumed compact, standard procedure allows us construct direct sum, gi = h bi, adgi(h), restriction h adjoint representation gi, satises adgi(h)bi = bi. therefore 1 connection form p1 1|q restriction q, setting 1|q = h1|q b11|q, 5 nd component transforms separately action adg1(h). follows  h1|q denes connection q. let p2 dened above, let h p2, q q, g2 g2. dene connection p2 2(h) = adg2 (g1 2 )h1(q); easy verify 2 well-dened p2 connection form. thus connection p1 denes connection p2. (adding tensorial b2-valued form  2 give us connections p2 h-components coinciding h-component 1) next, consider matter elds. conventionally thought cross-sections associated bundles, purposes global geometry preferable regard equivariant functions principal bundles. let f function principal g-bundle p , taking values nite-dimensional vector space v aords representation g. f satises r gf = (g1)f every g g,  f denes cross-section associated bundle dened v ; conversely, every cross-section denes function f . shall therefore refer functions p matter elds. (the reader nds unnatural may wish think traditional denitions vector elds matter multiplets terms components. denition matter elds used simply global version tradition.) let f1 matter eld bundle p1 discussed earlier, taking values v1 equivariant respect 1. restricting f1 q 1 h, obtain matter eld q taking values v1. peter-weyl theorem  implies, since groups compact, exists representation g2, 2, restricts representation h. dene matter eld f2 p2 f2(h ) = 2(g1 2 )f1(q); well-dened, since 2((h1g2)1) = 2(g1 2 )1(h) acting v1. (see also ref.  frobenius reciprocity.) thus see g1 matter elds re-interpreted g2 matter elds. 6 conclude, then, made following two observations. first, g1 g2 gauge groups, general dicult compare g2 gauge matter elds g1 gauge matter elds, elds live dierent spaces. second, however, comparisons possible g1 g2 large common subgroup h, provided g1 g2 principal bundles reduce common h-bundle. one expect kind duality work latter case. 3. gauge spinors let h connected, compact, non-simply-connected lie group, let eh non-trivial nite cover (not necessarily universal cover) h, eh nite central subgroup n eh/n = h. let eq principal eh-bundle manifold ; q = eq/n principal h-bundle . f matter eld eq, may may invariant respect n ; determined representation takes values. shall say f vectorial respect h invariant respect n , spinorial respect h otherwise. clearly f descends matter eld q vectorial. grand unication , given gauge group (usually standard group) h regarded subgroup larger group g. objective gain control kinds matter elds theory : representations h regarded restrictions g-representations accepted. course, peter- weyl theorem, h-representations restrictions g-representation, practice one requires g-representation small. addition, however, grand unied theories eect ruling h gauge spinors. representation eh descend representation h, sense said arise representation g. example, unbroken gauge group standard model  unitary group u (3), triply covered u (1) su (3). usual representations  u (3) appearing standard model obtained (small) su (5) representations, opposite true (spinorial) representations u (1) su (3) descend 7 representations u (3). inclusion matter elds dened representations kind would defeat whole point grand unication. essential understand gauge groups (heterotic) string theo- ries grand unication groups usual sense; unication string theory much subtle. consider, example, either e8 (e8 e8) z2. group maximal, maximal-rank subgroup globally isomorphic spin(16)/z2. fermionic formulation e8 theory, one sixteen left-handed fermions transforming 16 spin(16)/z2. however, representation exists 16 represen- tation spin(16), spin(16)/z2. words, elds spinorial respect spin(16)/z2. kind behaviour, cannot occur true e8 grand unied theory, vital importance string theory. importantly purposes, heterotic theories compactied tori toral orbifolds, winding modes  play crucial role t-duality fact gauge spinors respect certain groups. shall return point below. view remarks, need modify formalism preceding section allow possibility g1 g2 subgroups locally globally isomorphic. is, respective subgroups, h1 h2, isomorphic, lie algebra. exists group h nite central subgroups n1 n2, hi = h /ni. (note h subgroup either g1 g2, need simply connected.) suppose p1 principal g1 bundle admitting h1 subbundle q1. assume q1 non-trivial n1 cover q h bundle base. q2 = q/n2 well-dened h2 bundle, q2 extended usual g2 bundle p2. pair bundles reducing subbundles common gauge spinor bundle. next, let 1 connection p1, and, preceding section, let 1 = h1|q1 corresponding connection q1. pull-backs connections always dene connections, but, denotes projections : q q1, : h h1, have, 8 h h , r h 1 = ( rh)1 = r (h)1 = ad((h)) 1 = ad(h) 1, since n1 central. thus 1 indeed connection q; projects naturally connection q2, extended p2 usual. short, gauge elds freely moved, via q, one side other. matter elds, however, dierent. notice rst matter elds q1 q2 pulled back q, provides arena comparing exchanging elds. (this convenient regard matter elds equivariant functions principal bundles rather cross-sections.) however, may wish consider matter elds q pulled back either q1 q2; spinorial respect h1 h2. notice elds q vectorial respect h1 spinorial respect h2, vice versa; status given eld depend ones point view. relativity important ingredient -duality. general, elds q fall four sectors : invariant respect n1 n2, invariant respect one other, invariant respect neither. let us turn specic groups involved heterotic string theory. 4. global formulation t-duality gauge groups heterotic theories (e8 e8) z2 spin(32)/z2. subgroups locally isomorphic so(16) so(16), global picture simple. spin group spin(4m) centre form  z2 z2 = {1, k4m}, k4m covers so(4m) matrix i4m. course, so(4m) = spin(4m)/{1}, since ( k4m)2 = 1, also dene spin(4m)/{1, k4m}, diers 9 so(4m) 6= 2. group usually called spin(4m)/z2, no- tation would confusing purposes : shall call semispin(4m) instead. name motivated fact groups half-spin rep- resentations  faithful; fundamental half-spin representation semispin(4m) (22m1)-dimensional. mentioned earlier, e8 contains semispin(16), so(16) spin(16). (the adjoint e8 decomposes 248 = 128 120, 128 half-spinor semispin(16), 120 adjoint.) thus (e8 e8) z2 contains (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2. see z2 factor must included, note that, discussion t-duality torus, must break (e8 e8) z2 wilson loop; latter breaks gauge group centraliser element group. semispin(16) centraliser, e8, (1), projection 1 spin(16). since ((1), (1)) clearly invariant exchange automorphism, see centraliser element (e8e8)z2 indeed (semispin(16)semispin(16))z2. one might reasonably expect semispin(32), heterotic gauge group, contain subgroup, so(32) contains so(16) so(16). case, however. note rst spin(32) behave expected way : contains spin(16) spin(16), dot means 1 one spin(16) identied 1 other. however, upon projecting spin(32) semispin(32), obtain {$9906059$} subgroup spin(16) spin(16) = /(z2 z2), entire centre one spin(16) identied other. (we shall denote elements group b, a, b spin(16).) again, wilson- loop breaking torus wish express spin(16) spin(16) centraliser, cannot done; instead, semispin(32) centraliser k16 1 isomorphic (spin(16) spin(16)) z2, z2 acts exchanging two local spin(16) factors {$9906059$}. thus see 10 relevant subgroups (e8 e8) z2 semispin(32) locally globally isomorphic. moving on, let us note following. groups (e8 e8) z2 semispin(32) exhibit topological complications two dierent kinds : one disconnected, non-simply-connected. yet so(16) so(16) subgroups much similar. similarity, crucial t-duality, however delicately dependent dierences spin(4m) semispin(4m). one hand, e8 e8 contains non-simply-connected subgroup e8 contains semispin(16) spin(16). hand, subgroup discon- nected gauge group semispin(32) spin(32). mean following : theorem bott  states centraliser element connected, compact, simply connected lie group must connected. indeed, cen- traliser k16 1 spin(32) connected group spin(16) spin(16). sense, (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 disconnected (like (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2) semispin(32) simply connected. thus apparently opposite topo- logical complications two heterotic gauge groups unied t-duality. general fact made explicit case chl compactications  work lerche et al  show moduli space connections 2 compactication semispin(32) heterotic string two connected components (because semispin(32) simply connected), moduli space connections 2 compactication (e8 e8) z2 string ( group connected). chl compactications side correspond ex- tra components moduli spaces. general, always expect phenomena associated fact semispin(32) simply connected related way phenomena associated fact (e8 e8) z2 connected. shall return later. let us apply formalism preceding section case hand. objective construct semispin(32) bundle p1 admitting (spin(16) spin(16))z2 11 subbundle q1, q1 lifts h bundle q, turn projects (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2 bundle q2. rst objective course identify group h . simplicity, let us temporarily dispense z2 factors. since spin(16) spin(16) semispin(16) semispin(16) locally isomorphic, universal covering group, namely spin(16) spin(16). denitely good choice h , however, mathematical reasons and, importantly, physical ones. let q1 principal spin(16) spin(16) bundle admitting non-trivial z2 z2 cover q spin(16) spin(16) bundle base. q/{(1, 1), (1, 1)} spin(16) spin(16) bundle, so, spin(16) spin(16) subgroup spin(32), bundle extended spin(32) bundle. thus, take h = spin(16)spin(16), ruling semispin(32) conguration fails lift spin(32) conguration. however, known t-duality cannot work without semispin(32) gauge elds kind : berkooz et al  show dmw models {$9906059$} (e8 e8) z2 theory t-dual semispin(32) congurations. clearly necessary nd h double (rather quadruple) cover semispin(16) semispin(16) spin(16) spin(16). notice obvious group exists example, semispin(16) semispin(16) so(16) so(16) common cover spin(16) spin(16). fact fewer 22 distinct connected groups locally isomorphic spin(16) spin(16). these, however, fundamental groups isomorphic z2, namely so(16) spin(16), semispin(16) spin(16), spin(16) spin(16), certain group dened identifying 1 one spin(16) k16 another, spin(16) spin(16), dened identifying k16 one spin(16) k16 : is, spin(16) spin(16) = (spin(16) spin(16))/{(1, 1), ( k16, k16)}. dicult show none rst four candidates covers semispin(16) 12 semispin(16) spin(16) spin(16). semispin(16) semispin(16) = (spin(16) spin(16))/{(1 1), ( k16 1}, spin(16) spin(16) = (spin(16) spin(16))/{(1 1), (1) (1)}. thus, spin(16) spin(16) double-covers groups, unique (connected) physically acceptable candidate h . (as spin(16) spin(16) symmetrical be- tween two factors, dene (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 obvious way; since k16 1 (1) (1) invariant action z2, clear (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 double-covers (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2 (spin(16) spin(16)) z2.) framework global formulation -duality heterotic string theories therefore follows. begin semispin(32) bundle p1 admitting (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 subbundle q1. assume q1 non- trivial double cover q (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 bundle base. q certain matter elds, including winding modes may gauge spinors semispin(32) point view. let q2 = q/{1 1, k16 1}. q2 (semispin(16)) (semispin(16)) z2 bundle base q1, q2 may regarded subbundle (e8 e8) z2 bundle p2. matter elds q interpreted vectorial spinorial (e8 e8) z2 matter elds. crucial point matter (and gauge) elds live manifold, q, therefore makes sense speak mapping one another -duality. furthermore, since status given matter eld q (as gauge vector gauge spinor) dependent whether one takes semispin(32) (e8 e8) z2 point view, characteristic exchange winding non-winding modes easily accommodated. finally, assumption q exists, must course return, way requires p1 lift spin(32) bundle, handle dm w -like congurations. concrete examples may helpful. adjoint semispin(32) coincides so(32), decomposes so(16) so(16) 496 = (16, 16) 13 (120, 1) (1, 120), 120 adjoint so(16). tensor product (16, 16) legitimate representation spin(16) spin(16), though (16, 1) (1, 16) would be; (i16, i16) so(16) so(16) kernel (16, 16) (16, 1) (1, 16), k16 k16, corresponding element spin(16) spin(16), equals identity. matter eld f1 q taking values (16, 16) therefore gauge vector semispin(32) point view. hand, matter eld h1 q taking values half-spin representation (128, 1) (1, 128) (which legitimate representation spin(16) spin(16)) satisfy h1 r(1)(1) = h1, rg denotes action g spin(16) spin(16) q, h1 gauge spinor semispin(32); elds arise winding modes corresponding string theory compactied torus. e8 e8 side, also gauge vector h2 taking values (128, 1) (1, 128) (this legitimate representa- tion semispin(16) semispin(16)) winding mode gauge spinor f2, taking values (16, 16) (which representation spin(16) spin(16) semispin(16) semispin(16)). addition, matter elds g1, g2 sides, taking values (120, 1) (1, 120); representation spin(16) spin(16) semispin(16)semispin(16), g1 g2 gauge vectors points view. (the would true matter elds, any, taking values (128, 128).) -duality acts exchanging f1 f2, g1 g2, h1 h2, on. details need concern us : point meaningful global formulation -duality. is, elds exchanged live manifold, q, take values representations despite fact representations make sense original groups obtained wilson-loop breaking (e8 e8) z2 semispin(32). fact respective so(16) so(16) subgroups isomorphic leads ambiguity vec- tor/spinor status matter elds ambiguity proves nothing facet -duality. 14 one question remains, however : q actually exist? 5. existence gauge spin structures. -duality two heterotic theories originally formulated r9 s1, sn denotes n-sphere. manifold, every spin(16) spin(16) princi- pal bundle lifts spin(16) spin(16) bundle, every semispin(16) semispin(16) bundle. programme outlined preceding section therefore completed : every spin(16) spin(16) conguration -dual semispin(16) semispin(16) conguration r9 s1. recently, attempts made (most notably ref.) formulate -duality complicated manifolds, particularly k3. evidently, lifting problems complex cases. let p (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 bundle manifold . bration (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 p yields exact sequence  0 h 0(m, z2) h 0(p, z2) h 0((spin(16) spin(16)) z2, z2) h 1(m, z2), h i(x, z2) ith cohomology group x z2 coecients. clearly h 0((spin(16) spin(16)) z2, z2) non-trivial element; let us call j 16. fp last homomorphism exact sequence, dene x1(p ) = fp (j 16) h 1(m, z2). (and if) x1(p ) = 0, exactness sequence, h 0(p, z2) 6= 0, is, p disconnected. p reduced spin(16) spin(16) subbundle. course analogue orientability group. suppose x1(p ) = 0, that, eect, p spin(16) spin(16) bundle. bration spin(16) spin(16) p yields  another exact sequence, 0 h 1(m, z2) h 1(p, z2) h 1(spin(16) spin(16), z2) h 2(m, z2). 15 spin(16) spin(16) dened factoring spin(16) spin(16) subgroup {(1, 1), (1, 1), ( k16, k16), ( k16, k16)}. hence regard funda- mental group spin(16) spin(16), and, since isomorphic z2 z2, also h 1(spin(16) spin(16), z2). thus, denoting last homomorphism exact sequence fp , dene w2(p ) = fp (( k16, k16)) h 2(m, z2), x2(p ) = fp ((1, 1)) h 2(m, z2). (since spin(16)spin(16) outer automorphism mapping ( k16, k16) ( k16, k16), fp (( k16, k16)) gives nothing new.) following isomorphisms, notation self-explanatory. spin(16) spin(16) = (spin(16) spin(16))/{1 1, k16 k16} = (spin(16) spin(16))/{1 1, (1) (1)}. furthermore, h 1(p, z2) describes possible non-trivial double covers p . exactness sequence therefore implies w2(p ) = 0, p non- trivial double cover p spin(16) spin(16) bundle . p regarded subbundle semispin(32) bundle, latter non-trivial double cover spin(32) bundle . case one says  p vector structure. (notice problem really lift semispin(32) spin(32); projection spin(32) so(32), motivates terminology, always done.) thus w2(p ) generalised stiefel-whitney class  obstructs existence vector structures. way, x2(p ) = 0 means p another non-trivial double cover p , spin(16) spin(16) bundle . shall say case p admits exceptional structure, p /{1 1, k16 1} semispin(16) semispin(16) bundle extended e8 e8 bundle. complete global formulation heterotic -duality. begin semispin(32) bundle p1 admitting (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 subbundle q1. 16 require x2(q1) = 0. let q non-trivial double cover q1 structural group (spin(16) spin(16)) z2. q automatically non-trivial double cover certain (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2 bundle q2 = q/{1 1, k16 1}, may regarded subbundle (e8 e8) z2 bundle p2. explained preceding section, q arena exchanges dening -duality. several remarks made point. rst important condition x2(q1) = 0 not, course, always satised base manifolds . satised bundles r9 s1, since h 2(r9 s1, z2) = 0, complex manifolds certainly nd semispin(32) congurations q1 lift q. case, conguration globally well- dened e8 e8 partner : say topological obstruction t-duality. failure -duality (see ref. {$9905036$}) would pass undetected local level. notice x2 w2 take values cohomology group, one must beware possibility situation existence vector structure questionable. hand, two obstructions independent : existence vector structure way guarantees existence exceptional structure vice versa. (the existence two obstruction classes course due greater topological complexity spin(16) spin(16) compared so(32) semispin(32).) secondly, throughout assumed one begins semispin(32) bundle works towards (e8 e8) z2. however, one entitled begin (e8 e8) z2 bundle p2 admitting (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2 subbundle q2. element y1(q2) h 1(m, z2) obstructs reduction q2 semispin(16) semispin(16) bundle. assuming y1(q2) = 0 calling reduced bundle q2, ask whether q2 lifts spin(16) spin(16) bundle q; obstruction certain element y2(q2) h 2(m, z2). indeed y2(q2) = 0, 17 q exists, dene q1 = q/{1 1, (1) (1)}, spin(16) spin(16) bundle, t-duality goes through. stress w2, x2, y2 distinct standard stiefel-whitney class w2. latter would relevant study so(16) so(16) bundles lifting spin(16) spin(16) bundles; may seem directly relevant, since so(16 so(16) subgroup either heterotic gauge groups. however, w2 also governs lifting /z2 bundles spin(16) spin(16) bundles (see diagram ref. {$9906059$}) so, since /z2 contained projective special orthogonal group p so(32), latter structural group chan- paton bundles open string theory, w2 important type theory (and possibly establishing s-duality type heterotic semispin(32) theory .) notice vanishing obstructions x2 y2 suce establish t-duality. q1 q2 bundles x2(q1) = y2(q2) = 0, q1 q2 non-trivial (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 double covers, covers need same. dierent, t-duality cannot implemented. insist q1 (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 bundle x2(q2) = 0, q corresponding double cover, q/{1 1, k16 1} t-dual (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2 bundle; bundle obviously q double cover. (obviously y2(q/{1 1, k16 1}) = 0, x2 y2 related limited sense.) finally, additional complications rst cohomology group h 1(m, z2) vanish. follows second exact sequence q1 (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 bundle x2(q1) = 0, double cover q need unique: number possibilities counted |h 1(m, z2)|, order h 1(m, z2). strictly speaking, then, must label various (spin(16)spin(16)) z2 bundles q , = 1 |h 1(m, z2)|, corresponding given q1. winding modes might 18 fall topological sectors labelled i. (for toral compactications, one might interpret gauge spin structures terms boundary conditions.) problem that, general, (semispin(16) semispin(16)) z2 bundles q /{1 1, k16 1}, = 1 |h 1(m, z2)|, mutually isomorphic. would mean certain given semispin(32) conguration might t-dual one rather whole collection (e8e8)z2 congurations.

(1) (1) = 1 1, (1) (1) 6= 1 1. 20 thus {a a}, cover so(4) spin(16) spin(16), still (perhaps surprisingly) isomorphic so(4), whereas {a a}, cover spin(16) spin(16), isomorphic spin(4). take so(k3), extend usual way spin(16) spin(16) bundle. (we shall ignore disconnected version, since h 1(k3, z2) = 0 x1(q) = 0 (spin(16) spin(16)) z2 bundles k3.) is, dene q(so(k3)) = /so(4), so(4) acting left spin(16) spin(16) usual. dene semispin(32) bundle p (so(k3)) way. levi-civita connection corresponding ricci-at metric k3 regarded connection one-form so(k3), pushes forward gauge eld q(so(k3)) p (so(k3)); gauge eld strength coincide curvature form k3; short, embedded spin (actually, levi-civita) connection gauge group, semispin(32). set q(so(k3)) = /so(4). clearly q(so(k3)) spin(16)spin(16) bundle k3, extended spin(32) bundle. so(4), subgroup spin(32), contain k16 k16 = k32, fact q(so(k3))/{1, k32} = q(so(k3)). is, q(so(k3)) non-trivial double cover q(so(k3)); vector structure. w2(q(so(k3))) = 0. thus, embedding levi-civita connection semispin(32) always yields semispin(32) conguration vector structure. k3 manifold spin manifold, is, so(k3) non-trivial double cover spin(k3) spin(4) bundle k3.

(thus so(m )+l(m ) so(n)u (1) bundle ; so(m )l(m ) bundle .) clearly, spinc structures rarely unique exist, since may many choices l(m ). kahler manifolds, however, natural choice : take bundle unitary frames u (m ), set l(m ) = u (m )/su (n/2), n real dimension . enriques manifold, kahlerian, u (1) bundle inherits u (m ) connection holonomy z2. curvature therefore zero, spinc structure employed without changing local structures. hitchin manifold kahlerian, it, too, canonical choice l(m ), l(m ) connection, (even l(m ) xed, however, still usual source ambiguity dening spinc(m ), namely h 1(m, z2).) let us consider, then, bundles so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2) so(k3/(z2 z2)) + l(k3/(z2 z2)). so(4) so(2) bundles respective base manifolds. so(4) so(2) subgroup so(6), latter embeds naturally spin(16) spin(16), {a a, spin(6)}. hence dene q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2)) = /(so(4) so(2)), similarly q(so(k3/(z2 z2))) + l(k3/(z2 z2))). levi-civita con- nection form so(k3/z2), canonical connection form l(k3/z2), pull back so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2), direct sum denes  connec- tion there. connection pushes forward connection spin(16) spin(16) bundle q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2)) latters semispin(32) extension. easy see that, since so(4) so(2) covered spin(16) spin(16) subgroup isomorphic so(4) so(2), q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2)) 25 q(so(k3/(z2 z2)) + l(k3/(z2 z2))) vector structures: w2(q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2))) = 0, w2(q(so(k3/(z2 z2)) + l(k3/(z2 z2)))) = 0. now, however, let spinc(k3/z2) spinc(k3/(z2 z2)) denote spinc structures respective manifolds. q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2)) = /spin(4) spin(2) well-dened, spin(4)spin(2) cover so(4)so(2) spin(16)spin(16), similarly k3/(z2 z2).
