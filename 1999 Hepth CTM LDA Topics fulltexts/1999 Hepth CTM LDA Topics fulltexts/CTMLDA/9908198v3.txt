abstract

we consider the ads5 solution deformed by a non-constant dilaton interpo-
lating between the standard ads (uv region) and at boundary background
(ir region). we show that this dilatonic solution can be generalized to the
case of a non-at boundaries provided that the metric of the boundaries
satises the vacuum einstein eld equations.

as an example, we describe the case when the four-dimensional bound-

aries represent the kerr space-time.

the discovered recently remarkable ads/cft correspondence between
higher-dimensional classical supergravity and quantum gauge theory on the
boundary (bulk/boundary correspondence) [1] gives a new insight to the un-
derstanding of strongly coupled gauge theories. in particular, the ads5  s5
vacua of type-iib supergravity correspond to the four-dimensional super
yang mills theory on the boundary. this stimulated attempts to get descrip-
tion of running gauge coupling of yang-mills theory and qcd-connement
in frames of type-0 superstring theory [2, 3, 4].
in another approach
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9] the attempts to reproduce similar qcd-eects were based on
non-supersymmetric background solutions of type-iib string theory which
can be obtained under deformation of ads5  s5 vacuum by a non-constant
dilaton breaking the supersymmetry and conformal symmetry. exact solu-
tion of a such sort was rst given in [10] and we shall follow the notations of
this work. starting from ten-dimensional dilatonic gravity and the solution
with topology of ads5  s5 one can integrate out ve coordinates of the
sphere s5 and obtain [10, 9] eective action for ads5 background

s = z d5xg(cid:18)r

assuming that solutions for g and  depend only on coordinate y  x5, the
following ansatz for metric was proposed

where ij is the metric of minkowski background. as it was shown in [10, 9]
the solution of these equations can be given in ve dimensions by functions

f =

where 2 =  is positive. the main peculiarity of this solution is the
appearance of two boundaries corresponding to dierent limiting values of
the dilaton. this solution interpolates between conformal ads background
(weak coupling regime, y  ) and at space at singular value of dilaton
  6
the aim of this note is to pay attention to generalization of this solution
to the case of non-at four-dimensional boundaries. we shall show that any
metric of the form

2 ln y (strong coupling regime, y  0).

ds2 = gdxdx = f (y)dy2 + g(y)gikdxidxk

(7)

represents the solution of dilatonic gravity equations (2) and (3) provided
that the boundary metric gik satises the vacuum einstein equations. we
shall show that this result is valid for a d-dimensional boundary of adsd+1
as well. as an example we also consider in more details d=4 case when the
four-dimensional boundary represents the kerr geometry.

we consider d+1-dimensional metric (7) where gik is a d-dimensional
in the matrix

boundary metric, , ... = 0, 1, ...d, i, k, ... = 0, 1...d  1.
notations we have

g =   g(y)gik 0

while the contravariant form of this metric is given by

g =   g(y)1gik

where gik is contravariant form of the corresponding d-dimensional metric gik.
the expressions for the connections coecients 
 are given in appendix.

the important point is that rik represents ricci curvature of d-dimensional
board with the metric gik and the connections l
ik. similarly, the scalar
curvature is

r = g1 r +

since the d-dimensional vacuum einstein eld equations are gik = 0, one can
see that the components gik = 0 drop out of the equations (2) and (3). as a
result we come exactly to dierential equations for functions f and g given in
the paper [9] and to the expressions (5) and (6). therefore, the d-boundary
metric ik can be replaced by any metric gik satisfying the vacuum einstein
equations.

let us now consider the partial case d = 4 and the kerr metric gik. the

most convenient is to use the kerr-schild form of the kerr solution

gik = ik + 2hkikk,

where h is the harmonic scalar function

h = mr/(r2 + a2 cos2 ),

(17)

(18)

and m is the mass parameter. the vector eld ki(x) is tangent to principal
null congruence and it is determined by the 1-form

kidxi =

2
1 + y y

[du + y d + y d  y y dv],

where

angular coordinate. 2

2 is the projective

the eld ki is null in respect to minkowski metric, kikkik = 0, as well as

regarding the metric gik

kikkgik = 0.

(21)

one can build the ve dimensional eld k = (ki, 0) which will be obviously
the null eld also with respect to the full ve-dimensional metric

kkg = 0.

therefore the ve-dimensional kerr-ads metric takes the form

ds2 = f (y)dy2 + g(y)[ik + 2hkikk]dxidxk,

(22)

(23)

where the functions f (y), g(y) and h are given by (6), (5) and (18), and
vector eld ki is determined by expressions (19) and (20).

as it is known [11] the kerr solution has paid much attention as a model of
spinning particle. in the region of parameters corresponding to spinning par-
ticles the black hole horizons disappear and a region of the rotating disk-like
source is opened. the structure of this source has to possess some properties
of qcd-connement that is of an old problem. the conjectured ads/cft
correspondence gives a new look at this problem and stimulates to consider
new models, in particular, a model of source as a bag-like ads-region matched
to the standard kerr geometry out of core. the ads-bh solution of another
sort was considered in [12].
