abstract

we describe the generalization of spherical eld theory to other modal
expansion methods. the main approach remains the same, to reduce a
d-dimensional eld theory into a set of coupled one-dimensional systems.
the method we discuss here uses an expansion with respect to periodic-
box modes. we apply the method to 4 theory in two dimensions and
compute the critical coupling and critical exponents. we compare with
lattice results and predictions via universality and the two-dimensional
ising model.

1 introduction

recently spherical eld theory has been introduced as a non-perturbative method
for studying quantum eld theory [1]. the starting point of this approach is to
decompose eld congurations in a d-dimensional euclidean functional integral
as linear combinations of spherical partial waves. regarding each partial wave
as a distinct eld in a new one-dimensional system, the functional integral is
rewritten as a time-evolution equation, with radial distance serving as the pa-
rameter of time. the core idea of spherical eld theory is to reduce quantum
eld theory to a set of coupled quantum-mechanical systems. the technique
used is partial wave decomposition, but this can easily be generalized to other
modal expansions.
instead of concentric spheres and partial waves, we might
instead consider a generic smooth one-parameter family of (d  1)-dimensional

manifolds (disjoint and compact) and basis functions dened over each mani-
fold. there are clearly many possibilities and we can optimize our expansion
scheme to suit the specic problem at hand.

one important and convenient feature of spherical eld theory is that it
eliminates the need to compactify space  the spherical quantization surface
is already compact. this is useful for studying phenomena which might be in-
uenced by our choice of boundary conditions, such as topological excitations.
another interesting example arises in the process of quantization on noncom-
mutative geometries. spherical eld methods have recently been adapted to
study quantum eld theory on the noncommutative plane [2].
in many in-
stances, however, maintaining exact translational invariance is of greater value
than non-compactness or exact rotational invariance.
in that case one could
consider a system whose spatial dimensions have been compactied to form a
periodic box. the next step would be to expand eld congurations using
free modes of the box and evolve in time. we will refer to this arrangement as
periodic-mode eld theory or, more simply, periodic eld theory.1

in periodic eld theory the hamiltonian is time independent and linear mo-
mentum is exactly conserved.
in this work we describe the basic features of
periodic eld theory and use it to analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking in
euclidean two-dimensional 4 theory. we use the method of diusion monte
carlo to simulate the dynamics of the theory. the techniques discussed here
have several advantages over conventional euclidean lattice monte carlo meth-
ods. one is that periodic boundary conditions are not imposed on the time
variable, making it easier to determine the particle mass from an exponential
decay t. another is that the zero-momentum mode is regarded as a single
degree of freedom (rather than a collective mode on the lattice), which provides
a simpler description of vacuum expectation values and symmetry breaking.
other advantages arise in systems not considered here, such as the absence of
fermion doubling and extensions to minkowski space using non-stochastic com-
putational methods.

the organization of this paper is as follows. we begin with a derivation
of periodic eld theory. we then analyze two-dimensional 4 theory and its
corresponding periodic-eld hamiltonian using diusion monte carlo methods.
we compute the critical coupling at which    reection symmetry is
broken, and determine the critical exponents  and .2 we nd that our value
of the critical coupling is in agreement with recent lattice results [7], and our
values for the critical exponents are consistent with predictions via universality
and the two-dimensional ising model.

1periodic eld theory could be viewed as a hybrid of the hamiltonian and momentum-space

lattice formalisms. this combination, however, has not been discussed in the literature.

2 periodic elds

we start with free scalar eld theory in two dimensions subject to periodic
boundary conditions

(t, x  l) = (t, x + l).

(1)

in our discussion t is euclidean time, analytically continued from imaginary
minkowskian time. let j be an external source satisfying the same boundary
conditions and which vanishes as |t|  . the euclidean generating functional
in the presence of j is given by

and |0i is the ground state of h0. since h0 is the usual equal time hamiltonian,
|0i is the vacuum. h0 consists of a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators, and
it is straightforward to calculate the two-point correlation functions,

2 phase transition

the existence of a second-order phase transition in two-dimensional 4 theory
has been derived in the literature [3][4]. the phase transition is due to  devel-
oping a non-zero expectation value and the resultant spontaneous breaking of
   reection symmetry. it is generally believed that this theory belongs
to the same universality class as the two-dimensional ising model and there-
fore shares the same critical exponents.
in this section we apply periodic eld
methods to 4 theory in order to determine the critical coupling and critical
exponents  and . we have chosen  and  since these are, in our opinion,
the easiest to determine from direct computations. all other exponents can
be derived from these using well-known scaling laws. from the ising model
predictions we expect

 is the exponent associated with the inverse correlation length or, equiva-
lently, the mass of the one-particle state. we will determine the behavior of the
mass as we approach the critical point from the symmetric phase of the theory.

let |ai be any state even under reection symmetry. we consider the matrix
element

f (t) = ha| q0 exp (th) q0 |ai .

inserting energy eigenstates |ii satisfying h |ii = ei |ii, we have

f (t) = pi exp (tei)|hi| q0 |ai|2 .

(15)

(16)

since |ai and |0i are even under reection symmetry and q0 is odd, the vacuum
contribution to the sum in (16) vanishes. in the limit t  , (16) is dominated
by the contribution of the next lowest energy state, the one-particle state at
rest.3 in this limit we have

f (t)  emt,

(17)

where m is the mass. we can compute f (t) numerically using the method of
diusion monte carlo (dmc). the idea of dmc is to model the dynamics of the
imaginary-time schrodinger equation using the diusion and decay/production
of simulated particles. the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian determines
the diusion rate of the particles (usually called replicas) and the potential
energy term determines the local decay/production rate. a self-contained in-
troduction to dmc can be found in [5].

once we determine f (t) using dmc simulations we can extract m and  using
curve-tting techniques. we have calculated m as a function of  for several
dierent values of l and nmax. results from these calculations are presented
in the next section.

 is the critical exponent describing the behavior of the vacuum expectation
value.
in the symmetric phase the vacuum state is unique and invariant under
the reection transformation    (or equivalently qn  qn, for each n).
in the broken-symmetry phase the vacuum is degenerate as l  , and q0, the
in the l  
zero-momentum mode, develops a vacuum expectation value.
limit tunnelling between vacuum states is forbidden. one ground state, |0+i , is
non-zero only for values q0 > 0 and the other, |0i, is non-zero only for q0 < 0.
we will choose |0+i and |0i to be unit normalized.

let us now dene the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations,

|0si = 12 (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:12)0+(cid:11) +(cid:12)(cid:12)0(cid:11)(cid:1)
|0ai = 12 (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:12)0+(cid:11) (cid:12)(cid:12)0(cid:11)(cid:1) .

(19)

3we are assuming that this contribution does not also vanish. this is generally true, and

we can always vary |ai to make it so.

each case 
4! = 2.76 and  = 4. all quantities are measured in units where
 = 1. as can be seen, the distributions are bimodal and the maxima for both
curves occur near 0.55. we observe that the peaks are taller and narrower
for larger l. this is consistent with our intuitive picture of uctuations in the
functional integral. for a small but xed deviation in the average value of
, the net change in an extensive quantity such as the action or total energy
scales proportionally with the size of system. consequently the average size of
the uctuations must decrease with l. we can estimate the amplitude of the
uctuations, , by assuming a quadratic dependence in  about the local
minimum. the net eect of the uctuation should not scale with l, and we
conclude that6

this agrees with the free eld result in (28) and also appears to be consistent
with the peak widths plotted in figure 2.

let zmax be the location of the non-negative maximum of g(z). since g(z)

both will converge to the same value as l  . however, the zmax result is
less prone to systematic error generated by the o( 1l

above.7 we will therefore use

the rst error bounds include inaccuracies due to monte carlo statistics, higher
energy states (for the mass curves), and extrapolation. the second error bounds
represent estimates of the systematic errors due to our choice of initial state,
time step parameter, and bin sizes in the dmc simulations. for data generated
from the mass curves, the main source of error was due to extrapolation. the
extrapolation error for the vacuum expectation value data was still the most
signicant, though considerably smaller than that for the mass calculations.
this reduction is probably a result of the method used to measure the vacuum
expectation value.10 our results for the critical exponents are consistent with

methods we have analyzed two-dimensional 4 theory and computed the critical
coupling and critical exponents  and  associated with spontaneous breaking of
   reection symmetry. our value of the critical coupling is in agreement
with a recent lattice calculation, and our values for the critical exponents are
consistent with the critical exponents of the two-dimensional ising model. this
lends support to the popular belief that the two theories belong to the same
universality class.

the full set of diusion monte carlo computations used in our analysis
required about 30 hours on a 350 mhz pc processor. complete codes can
be obtained upon request from the authors. the required computational time
appears to be dominated by the number of operations required to update the
hamiltonian, which scales as n 2
max. errors can be reduced quite substantially
by using larger values of l and nmax and utilizing large-scale parallel processing.
no less important, however, is that periodic eld theory provides a simple and
ecient approach to studying non-perturbative phenomena with only modest
computer resources.
improvements are now under way to utilize fast fourier
transform methods [8] and increase the computational speed. future studies
have been planned to analyze phase transitions in other eld theory models.
