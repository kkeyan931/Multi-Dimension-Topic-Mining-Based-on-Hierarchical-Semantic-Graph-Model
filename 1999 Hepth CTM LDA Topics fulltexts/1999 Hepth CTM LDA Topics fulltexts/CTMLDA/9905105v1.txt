1 introduction

an increasing number of integrable systems with internal degrees of free-
dom have been shown to exhibit a yangian symmetry. one of the earliest
example of this is perhaps the haldane-shastry spin chain [1] and the spin
generalisation of the calogero-sutherland model investigated in [2].

in the realm of integrable systems the quantum nonlinear schrodinger
(nls) model distinguishes itself by being one of the most studied system
and its simplest version played an important role in the development of the
quantum inverse scattering method (qism). recently the authors of [3]
have considered the quantum nls model with spin 1
2 fermions and repul-
sive interaction on the line and have unraveled the presence of a yangian
symmetry y (sl(2)).

in this paper we consider the most general case of the quantum nls
model with n-components bosons or fermions and prove that the yangian
symmetry is y (sl(n)). in addition we provide an explicit realisation of the
yangian generators using the algebra of creation and annihilation operators
for scattering states that is an essential part of the qism, also known as
the zamolodchikov-faddeev (zf) algebra [4]. this approach makes it clear
that the yangian is actually a symmetry of the whole quantum integrable
hierarchy whose lowest instance is the nls model. as a by-product, we
also obtain all the solutions to the equations of motion of the quantum nls
hierarchy.

the structure of the paper is the following. in section 2 we summarize
the qism applied to the nls model. section 3 in devoted to the study
of the yangian symmetry of the nls model.
in section 4 we outline the
construction of the yangian generators, as well as the higher hamiltonians
of the nls hierarchy, in terms of creation and annihilation operators of the
zf algebra, the technical details being gathered in the appendices. next we
present a connection between the action of the yangian algebra restricted to
the subspaces of xed particle number and a class of nite w -algebras. we
conclude with possible extensions of this work.

2 the multicomponent nonlinear schrodinger

model

we shall consider the n-components quantum nonlinear schrodinger model
with bosons or fermions and repulsive coupling. we rst collect a few known
results from the quantum inverse scattering method applied to the model,
most of which can be found in [5, 6] with more details.

the hamiltonian of the nls model is

h =z dx i

x

i

x  gijij! ,

(2.1)

where the elds operators satisfy the equal time canonical commutation re-
lations

[i(x), j(y)] = j

i (x  y),

[i(x), j(y)] = [i(x), j(y)] = 0.

the conventions are that  = 1 for bosons,  = 1 for fermions and [ , ]
stands respectively for the commutator or anti-commutator. latin indices
run from 1 to n, whereas greek indices run from 1 to n + 1. repeated
indices are summed over their appropriate range.

the linear operator of the qism is


2

l(x|) = i

 + (x), with (x) = ig(cid:16)j(x)ej,n +1  j(x)en +1,j(cid:17) .
(2.2)
in this equation e is the standard (n +1)(n +1) matrix (e) = 
and  is a diagonal matrix  = in +12en +1,n +1, where in +1 is the identity
matrix.
the quantum monodromy matrix t (x, y|) is dened by the equations


x

t (x, y|) = : l(x|)t (x, y|) :,
where :
: denotes the usual normal order for the eld operators (x) and
(x). the innite volume limit is a delicate issue in the qism [6]. the
innite volume monodromy matrix t () is formally dened by

t (x, y|)|x=y = in +1,

(2.3)

t () =

lim

x,y

e(x|)t (x, y|)e(y|),

2

where e(x|) = exp(ix/2). using the implicit representation for t (x, y|),

t (x, y|) = e(x  y|) +z x

y

dx1 e(x  x1|) : (x1)t (x1, y|) :

the monodromy matrix t () can formally be computed through an iterative
procedure and is expressed as

xn=1z 

nxi=1

t () = in +1+

dnx (x1 > . . . > xn)e(2

()ixi|) : (x1) . . . (xn) :
(2.4)
the commutation relations for innite volume are encoded in the ex-



change relation

the term i0 is a consequence of the principal value regularisation adopted
when  goes to zero, according to the relation (in the sense of distributions)

  i0  i().

it will be convenient to rename some elements of the monodromy matrix
such as d() = tn +1,n +1() and bj() = tn +1,j(). further examination of
some components of (2.5) yields the following relations

d()bj() =

d()d() = d()d(),
   + ig
   + i0
bj()bk() = (  )
    ig

(2.9)

the matrix element d() serves as a generating operator-function for the
commuting integrals of motion of the nls model. this is most easily seen

by performing an asymptotic expansion for large  in the solution (2.4),
whereby one gets

n ( n  1)(cid:19)

n =z dx jj,

and h is given in (2.1). consequently, eq. (2.7) implies that these integrals
of motion are all in involution.

in the multicomponent nls model the commutation relations amongst
bj() and their adjoint have to be deduced from another type of exchange
relation (see [5] for details). moreover these operators hardly make sense as
operators on the hilbert space [6] and it is necessary to consider instead the
scattering states operators

aj() =

i
g

bj()d1(),

(2.11)

and their adjoint ak(). then the commutation relations amongst a() and
a() are nicely encoded in the form of a zamolodchikov-faddeev (zf) alge-
bra [4] as (a sort of deformed oscillator algebra):

aj()ak() = rnm

aj()ak() = am()an() rjk
aj()ak() = am() rkn

kj (  ) am()an(),
mn(  ),

jm(  ) an() + k

j (  ),

where the r-matrix given by

(2.13)

(2.15)

is the two-body scattering matrix of the n-components nls model.

the operators a() and a() play the role of creation and annihilation
operators and as such can be used to build a fock space through their action
on the vacuum. owing to (2.8) these states are simultaneous eigenstates of
the conserved quantities. actually, the set of (asymptotic scattering) states

qn
i=1 ai(i)|0i for all n is dense in the hilbert space of the nls model [6, 7].
this property will be useful later on.
the original eld operator k(x) can be recovered from the knowledge
of the scattering data. this is achieved by solving a system of quantum
gelfandlevitan equations, whose result is a quantum version of the rosales
expression [8, 9] (given here for t = 0):

(2.16)

in this subsection we shall show that the nls model contains an innite set
of conserved charges having the structure of a yangian algebra. there are
several equivalent denitions of the yangian y (sl(n)) and we present two of
them in appendix a.

the yangian symmetry of the nls model manifests itself already in the

exchange relation (2.5). indeed, denoting by et () the n  n submatrix of
t (), et () = tij()eij, and examining the appropriate components of (2.5),

one deduces the following relations

with yet another r-matrix

er(  ) et ()  et () = et ()  et () er(  )
er(  ) = (  )ejk  ekj + igin  in .

this coincides precisely with the dening relation of the yangian y (gl(n)).
the fact that the yangian algebra commutes with the hamiltonian of
the nls model is a consequence of the exchange relation as well, since one
extracts from (2.5) that

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

[etij(), d()] = 0

and the hamiltonian is just one of the conserved quantities in the asymptotic
expansion (2.10).

it is of some interest to get an explicit representation of the yangian
generators in terms of the eld operators i(x). this is achieved with the

5

help of the iterative solution (2.4) of the monodromy matrix t (), and by
looking at its asymptotic expansion for large  one nds that

etjk() = jk +

ig

 z dx k(x)j(x) +

2(cid:16)z dx k(x)j(x)

(3.4)

3 )

(3.5)

in particular this shows that in this model the formal series expansion of the
yangian generators (see a.2) is to be understood as an asymptotic expansion
for large .

the most important relations for our purpose are the commutators of
jl with the creation operators ak(). using the
exchange relation (2.5), the denition (2.11) and the symmetry property (3.3)
one nds that

the yangian generators et (n)

[etjl(), ak()] =

ig

    i0

al()etjk(),

which, upon expanding in 1/, yields

(3.6)

(3.7)

jl , ak()] = al()jk,

[et (0)
[et (1)
jl , ak()] =  al()jk + ig al()et (0)

jk .

in the next section we shall need a more convenient basis of y (sl(n)) (see
appendix a). it will also be convenient to deal with self-adjoint generators
for the yangian algebra. it turns out that these two requirements can be

fullled in a single operation. let us denote by et () the hermitian conjugate
of the n  n matrix et () obtained by transposing the matrix and taking

the adjoint of its entries (which are operators in a hilbert space), namely

its anti-hermitian part is simply

it is instructive to study the type of yangian representations that appear
in the hilbert space of the nls model. the vacuum is invariant under the
0,1 and the one-particle state ak()|0i transforms as an evaluation
representation in the fundamental representation of sl(n) [10], denoted by
v (), since

4 yangian generators and deformed oscilla-

tors

in view of formul (2.16) and (3.4), it is clear that trying to reconstruct the
yangian generators (in term of oscillators) by direct calculation is a dicult
task. instead we shall dene two operators qa
1 that have the same
commutation relations with a() as in (3.13) and (3.14). therefore their
action on the fock space spanned by the a() will coincide with that of
0,1 and, as this fock space is dense in the hilbert space of the nls model,
we shall identify these operators. all the other yangian generators are built
from these two sets of elements.

0 and qa

eqa

in order to simplify the presentation, we adopt a more compact notation
for the zf algebra. we drop the explicit mention of the indices i, j and the
momenta i, and introduce instead a new index refering to an n-dimensional
auxiliary space. more explicitly

where ei
for instance, the r-matrix (2.15) reads

1 is some basis of the n-dimensional auxiliary space labeled by 1.

a1  ai(1) ei
1,

r12  r12(1  2) =

1

1  2 + ig
8

((1  2)1  1 + igp12),

(4.1)

where p12 is the permutation operator in the auxiliary spaces. the inverse
of r12 is r21 = r21(2  1). with this notation, the zf algebra relations
read

a1a2 = r21 a2a1,
a
1a
1 r21,
a1a

2 = a
2 = a

2a
2 r12 a1 + 12.

(4.2)

we also rename the operators we are looking for as j a = qa
thus (3.13) and (3.14), and their conjugate, translate to

0 and sa = qa
1.

[j a, a
0] = a

[j a, a0] = ta

0 means that the su(n) matrix ta is acting in the auxiliary space

we rst construct the operator j a. the idea is to built it recursively in
such a way that the relations (4.3-4.4) are fullled. the expansion parameter
is not the coupling constant g but rather the number of oscillators. more
precisely, we start with the expression

j a =

()n+1

n!

xn=1

j a
(n) =

()n+1

n!

xn=1

a
1...nt a

1...nan...1,

(4.7)

where an...1 = an(n)    a2(2)a1(1) and the integration on 1, 2, . . . , n is
implied in j a. we then determine the tensors t a
1...n recursively. the details
of the calculation are relegated in appendix b, and we nd as a result that

t a
1...n =

nxj=1

n
j ta

j

with

n

j  1!.
j = ()j1  n  1

these generators verify as well

[j a, j b] = if ab

cj c.

they form the sl(n) subalgebra of y (sl(n)).

9

(4.8)

(4.9)

we then look for operators sa of a similar form

sa =

n!

xn=1

sa

(n) =

()n+1

n!

xn=1

a

1...net a

1...nan...1

(4.10)

satisfying (4.5-4.6). in this case, the procedure is simpler since sa lives in
the adjoint representation of the subalgebra generated by j a. this implies
that

sa = 

i
c2

f a

bc [sb, j c],

(4.11)

where c2 is as usual the second casimir in the adjoint representation, c2b
a =
facdf bcd. using the explicit expression (4.7) for j a and imposing that sa
satises (4.5-4.6) enables us to compute the right-hand side of (4.11) and to

determine the tensors et a

1...n.

expression is (see appendix c):

as anticipated from (4.5) the tensors depend on the momenta and their

(4.12)

therefore the expressions (4.7) and (4.10) provide a realisation of the yangian
generators in terms of the zf algebra.

a similar procedure can be applied to the integrals of motion (or higher
hamiltonians) of the nls model. the lowest hamiltonians n, p, h are ex-
plicitly known, and from (2.8), (2.10) and (2.11) we nd that

[ n, a
[p, a
[h, a

0] = a
0,
0] = 0 a
0,
0 a
0] = 2
0.

let us now dene the innite set of commuting operators in, n  0 by

in =z d1 n

1 a

1a1

which enjoy the following commutation relations

[ in, a
0 a
0] = n
0,
[ in, a0] = n
0 a0.

10

(4.13)

(4.14)

this implies that acting on a m-particles state

in a

1 . . . a

mxj=1
m|0i = (

j ) a
n

1 . . . a

m|0i

(4.15)

which is precisely the denition of the higher hamiltonians in the quantum
nls model [6]. according to (4.14) the lowest ones are obviously identied
with

n = i0,

p = i1,

h = i2.

moreover we can show that d() is a generating operator-function for
the integrals of motion, that is, it can be expressed entirely in terms of the
in operators. indeed we can prove that

d() = exp(d()),

where

and

dn = ig

nxj=0

n + 1  n + 1
(ig)nj

d() =

xn=0
j ! ij.

dn
n+1 ,

(4.16)

(4.17)

as the in commute with each other and satisfy (4.14), it is straightforward
to show that

exp(d()) a

0 exp(d()) = 1 +

ig

  0)! a

0

which is precisely the relation between d() and a
this proves the assertion (4.16).

0 as deduced from (2.8).

owing to the explicit expressions (4.7) and (4.10), it is very easy to check
that the operators in commute with j a and sa. as j a, sa generate the
yangian algebra, then obviously the in commute with the whole yangian
algebra. this is just another way of expressing the content of (3.3). it also
means that the yangian is a symmetry of all the quantum systems dened
with the help of the higher hamiltonians.

as usual, the time evolution of the quantum eld k(x) of eq. (2.16) is
given by the conjugation by the nls hamiltonian (2.1) which is nothing but
i2. according to the commutation relations (4.14), this amounts to multiply
in (2.16) the creation operators a() by ei 2t and the annihilation operators
a() by ei2t. although the expression (2.16) was originally obtained as the

11

solution to the nls equation of motion, it also provides the solution to the
higher ows of the hierarchy. simply, the tn-time evolution is now induced
by a conjugation by exp(i intn). consequently, the phases multiplying the
creation and annihilation operators are respectively ei ntn and eintn. it is
remarkable to get in such an easy way the solutions to all the equations of
motion of the hierarchy.

5 connection with nite w -algebras

it has already been shown that there is a strong connection between yangians
y (sl(n)) and nite w algebras [11]. we show in this section that the nls
hierarchy oers a natural framework to illustrate this relation.

for such a purpose, we focus on the fock space f spanned by the
ai() and detail its structure. let us recall that the p-particles subspace
fp(1, . . . , p) with xed momenta (1, . . . , p) is a tensor product of p eval-
uation representations p
i=1v (i), all in the fundamental representation of
su(n). the p-particles subspace fp is just the span over all momenta i.

on fp it is straightforward to see that the yangian generators t(n)

ij with
n  p act as zero operators. we thus have a representation of a truncated
yangian, which is known to be isomorphic, at the algebra level, to a nite
w (gl(np), n.sl(p)) algebra [12]. thus on each p-particles subspace the yan-
gian acts as a w (gl(np), n.sl(p)) algebra. this is another nice application
of nite w algebras (more examples can be found in [13] and references
therein).

let us illustrate this point on the simplest case, namely p = 2 and n = 2.
consequently, the only independent yangian generators are qa
1 and their
action on f2 is given in (3.15). let us denote their representation on f2 by
j a and sa respectively. up to an innocuous shift sa  sa  1
2p j a, the full
set of commutation relations satised by these operators is

0, qa

[j a, j b] = if ab
[j a, sb] = if ab

[sa, sb] = if ab

(5.1)

one recognizes here the relations of the w -algebra w (gl(4), 2.sl(2)).

w (gl(4), 2.sl(2)) and w (sl(4), 2.sl(2)) algebras essentially dier by one
central element. in the present context, this element is nothing but p , the

12

total momentum. thus, the transition between the two w -algebras amounts
to describe the system in its center of mass frame.

6 conclusions and outlook

(solitons) and the asymptotic scattering states qn

we deliberately imposed the restriction that the coupling constant g be pos-
itive. when g is negative, the quantum spectrum also contains bound states
i=1 ai(i)|0i are no longer
complete in the hilbert space of the nls model. our construction relies
crucially on the completeness of those states in order to identify the gener-
ators of the yangian symmetry (3.11) with the generators (4.7) and (4.10)
expressed in term of the zamolodchikov-faddeev algebra elements.

in both regions of the coupling constant, the yangian generators commute
with the scattering matrix and the yangian corresponds to a symmetry of the
scattering matrix. the nuance is that in the second situation we have only
dened the action of the yangian generators on the asymptotic scattering
states and the best we can say about the operators (4.7) and (4.10) is that
they generate an asymptotic symmetry of the nls model. extending their
denition to the full hilbert space would require the complete knowledge of
the bound states spectrum of the nls model, something not yet achieved.

from a more general point of view, when considering our construction
as solely based on the existence of a zf algebra we may conclude that it is
possible to realise a yangian algebra on the fock space generated by the zf
algebra whenever the r-matrix is of the rational type given in (2.15). for
the nls model, the s-matrix is invariant under su(n) and the symmetry
algebra turns out to be a yangian y (sl(n)). let us mention that the su(n)-
thirring model is another quantum system with such rational r-matrix, thus
providing a relativistic example of a system with yangian symmetry [14].

it would be interesting to exhibit the symmetry algebra of more general
cases where the r-matrix is not rational but is still invariant under some lie
group. as the r-matrix in the zf algebra can be interpreted as the two-body
s-matrix of integrable systems in 1+1 dimensions, this question reduces to
the problem of identifying the largest s-matrix symmetry of such integrable
systems. the study of this sort of relationship in a more general situation is
certainly interesting and we intend to return to it in a future paper.

the nls model considered in the present work is dened on the line.
usually the presence of boundaries strongly inuences the symmetry and

13

we are currently investigating this issue in the nls model on the half line.
its quantication as a quantum eld theory, as carried out in [15], reveals
the presence of a boundary exchange algebra generalizing the zf algebra,
thus tting well within the more general scheme of integrable systems with
boundaries developed in [16]. we still expect the system to possess a large
internal symmetry, possibly in the form of a twisted yangian algebra [17] and
we also expect to be able to express these symmetry generators in terms of
the boundary exchange algebra [18].

a denition of y (gl(n ))

the yangian y (gl(n)) can be dened as the free associative algebra over c
with generators 1, t(n)
k used elsewhere in
the text) quotiented by the relation [10]

ij , n  0 (not to be confused with ta

ry (  ) t()  t() = t()  t() ry (  ),

(a.1)

where we introduced the n  n matrix t() whose entries are formal series
in 

tij() = ij + h

and the r-matrix is given by

ij

t(n)
n+1

xn=0

(a.2)

(a.3)

ry (  ) = (  )eij  eji  hin  in .

the non-zero deformation parameter h can be scaled away as two yangians
with dierent non-zero deformation parameter are known to be isomorphic.

the quantum determinant

detq(t()) = xsn

sign()t1,(1)(  n + 1) . . . tn,(n )()

(a.4)

generates the innite dimensional center z, and the yangian y (gl(n)) is
isomorphic to z  y (sl(n)).

14

the coproduct in this presentation is simply

(tij()) =

nxk=1

tik()  tkj().

(a.5)

in the main text, we use the notion of an evaluation representation. in the
t(n)
ij basis, it is dened by the composition of the algebra homomorphism

tij() = ij +

eij


,

(a.6)

where eij are the generators of gl(n), with any representation of gl(n). in
particular, the yangian generators t(n)

ij with n  1 act as zero operators.

alternatively, the yangian y (sl(n)) can also be dened as the unique
homogeneous quantization of sl(n)[u] (the polynomial maps from the com-
plex plane to sl(n)) [19]. it is generated by the two sets of elements qa
0 (a
basis of sl(n)) and qa

1 subject to the following constraints

rzf xz

g(cid:17) eg s3(qp

0, qq

0, qr

1),

where ab is the killing form on sl(n) and s3(., ., .) is the totally symmetrized
product of three terms (normalized to s3(x, x, x) = x3).

the rst presentation is helpful to identify the type of algebraic struc-

ture generated by et () in (3.1). the second one is more convenient when

constructing explicitly the yangian generators, as only two sets of elements
are necessary to generate the whole yangian y (sl(n)).

b construction of j a

to construct j a, we heavily use the notation of internal spaces, which en-
codes both su(n) indices and momenta. recall also that in this notation,
rji = r1
ij . the key observation in the construction of j a is that, due to the

15

presence of ij in (4.2), the commutator of j a
0 contains two contri-
butions with dierent number of oscillators. for the simplest case of n = 1
one has

(n) with a

[j a

(1), a

0] = a

0a

1 (r01t a

1 r10  t a

1 ) a1 + a

0t a
0 .

(b.1)

1 = ta
1.

in the commutator [j a, a

comparing with (4.3), the term with no annihilation operator completely
xes t a
0], the only other term with one
annihilation operator comes from the commutator [j a
0] and we dene
t a
12 so that these two contributions cancel. repeating this procedure for
increasing number of oscillators uniquely determines the tensors t a

(2), a

1...n.

in this appendix, we adopt a dierent point of view, namely we prove

that the solution given in (4.8) is indeed correct.

for generic n, one has

[j a

(n), a

0] = a

0a

1...n(cid:16)r1

n t a

1...nrn  t a

1...n(cid:17) an...1 + a

where

(b.2)

(b.3)

(b.4)
(b.5)

here the notation t a
k  1 for k > i.

then, we simplify the expression for bn:

1...n|i represents the indices substitutions i  0 and k 

bn =

=

the simplication of cn is achieved using the sl(n) invariance of the r-
matrix, [r0k, ta

0 + ta

n

i = 0,

nxi=1

nxi=k+1

and leads to

cn =

finally, we get that

bn = (bn  cn) + cn = nr1

n1[t a

1...n1,rn1]

(b.6)

so that the commutator (b.2) reduces to

[j a

(n), a

0] = a

01...nr1

1...n,rn]an...1  na

01...n1r1
1...n1,rn1]an1...1.
therefore, adjusting properly the coecient of j a
(n) as in (4.7), we obtain a
complete cancellation of all the terms but one, yielding precisely the required
commutation relation (4.3). the proof of (4.4) is similar.
