summary

severel energy-momentum tensors of gravitational eld are considered
and compared in the lowest approximation. each of them together with
energy-momentum tensor of point-like particles satises the conservation laws
when equation of motion of particles are the same as in general relativity. it
is shown that in newtonian approximation the considered tensors dier one
from the other in the way their energy density is distributed between energy
density of interection (nonzero only at locations of particles) and energy
density of gravitational eld.

starting from lorentz invariance the lagrangians for spin-2, mass-0 eld
are constracted. they dier only by divergences. from these lagrangians
by belinfante-rosenfeld procedure the energy-momentum tensors are build.
only one of them is suitable for explaining the perihelion shift. this tensor
does not coincide with weinbergs one (directly obtainable from einstein
equation).

it is noted that phenomenological eld-theoretical approach (utilizing
only vertices and propagators) can lead to modication of theory in the
region of strong eld, where till now no observational data are available.

introduction

general relativity is a complete, elegant, and self-consistent theory. yet there
is a necessity to obtain gravity by eld-theoretical means starting from at
spacetime, see e.g.[1-5]. it is widely believed that on this way even dropping
the general covariance requirement we naturally get general relativity. it is
supposed that in the lowest nonlinear approximation this is demonstrated in
detail by thirring [2]. yet this conclusion can not be drawn from [2], see
sec.2.

in this connection and also because the gravitational collapse is consid-
ered as the greatest crisis in physics [6] the research into possible alternative

1

theories acquire especial signicance.
it is quite natural to make the rst
step and to consider the simplest processes by utilizing vertices; the graviton
propagator is known by analogy with electrodynamics.

in the lowest nonlinear approximation it is necessary to know only 3-
graviton vertex. we assume the simplest possibility: the source of graviton
is the energy-momentum tensor of two other gravitons. in higher approxi-
mations probably other vertices will be needed. along this path one can nd
out what theories are possible without assuming general covariance and a
priori restriction on vertices. an important step in this direction was made
by thirring [1-2]. we continue his investigation in the same approximation
and restrict ourselves to point-like classical particels as sources of gravitation.
mainly we are interested in the simplest system consisting of a newtonian
center and test particle moving in its eld.

in general relativity classical particles move along geodesics in rieman-
nian space. this is the incarnation of equivalence principle and it is more
reliable than specic equation determining the gravitational eld [9]. be-
sides, the equation of motion for particles are obtainable from variational
principle without any appeal to general relativity, see equation (2) on page
181 in [6]. it is easy to verify also that eq.(11) in [2], derived in this way
coincide exactly with that of general relativity. as to the equation deter-
mining gravitational eld, it is possible to think that the phenomenological
eld-theoretical approach will lead to more complicated algorithm for get-
ting the eld. an interesting possibility in this direction was pointed out by
schwinger [10], see also sec. 6.

it is reasonable to believe together with einstein that for some reason
or other the singular behaviour near the gravitational radius does not cor-
.
respond to reality, see 15 in .paiss book [11] and einstein paper [12].
at present the schwarzschild singularity is concidered as ctitious by many
researchers because the geometry is nonsingular there. see however the text
after (2.2.6) in [13] and after eq.(9.40) in [14], where they say convincingly
about physical singularity. by eld-theoretical approach it is dicult to un-
derstand why in a nite system the acceleration of a freely falling particle
becomes unlimited when it nears the horizon. such a behaviour should be
connected with the fact that according to [15] the gravitational energy in
vacuum outside the sphere of radius r goes to  for r  rg. in confor-
mity with this the energy of matter and gravitational eld inside the sphere
of radius r goes to +, in such away that total energy of spherical body

2

is equal to its mass. but if a theory predict that the absolute value of eld
energy outside sphere of radius r might be greater than total energy of a
body then the analogy with electrodynamics suggests that the concept of
external eld becomes inapplicable [16]. the belief in general relativity in
similar circumstances is based upon the concept of nonlocalazability of grav-
itational energy, see, e.g. 20.4 in [6]. what is more, general relativity does
not need as a rule the gravitational energy -momentum pseudotensor.
the situation changes drastically, when we begin to constract gravity the-
ory starting from at spacetime. here the gravitational energy-momentum
tensor appears to be necessary to describe the 3-graviton interaction. the
nonlinear correction to the motion of a test particle depends on the chosen
energy-momentum tensor. the latter is build from eld lagrangian, which
is not unique as one can add to it some divergence terms. this leads to dif-
ferent energy-momentum tensors. they can give rise to gravitational energy
densities, which may have even dierent signs. the question of sign of energy
density is of interest by itself. provided the sign turns out to be positive, one
should expect the weakening of gravitational interaction at r  rg = 2gm
in comparison with newtonian one in order that the gravitational energy
outside the sphere of radius r were much less than the mass m of the center.
the possibility of decreasing of interaction at small distances is suggested
also by the behaviour of attraction force between two bodies supported by
weils strut, see, 35 [17].
in order to understand in what way the various energy-momentum tensors
dier one from the other we consider the following tensors: thirrings [1,2],
landau-lifshitzs [16], papapetrou-weinbergs [9] and tensor obtained from
the lagrangian given in exercise 7.3 in [6]. the second and third tensors
are representatives of general relativity, the rest are build from lagrangians
of free eld of spin-2, mass-0 particles and symmetrized by the belinfante-
rosenfeld procedure, see, 1 ch.7 in [18].
in the considered approach it is suitable to subdivide the 3-graviton vertex
into three vertices in accordance with three possibilities for choosing two
gravitons out of three to form the energy-momentum tensor,- the source for
the third graviton, see sec.3. so three diagrams contribute to nonlinear
correction to the eld. in contrast with this the energy-momentum tensor,
guring in the solution of einstein equation by iteration procedure, is so
dened that the correction to eld is given simply by means of propagator,
i.e. by one diagram only, see sec.2.

3

the main result of the paper is this: starting from quadratic lagrangians

(diering by divergence terms) of spin-2, mass-0 particles, the energy-momentum
tensors are constructed by belinfante-rosenfeld procedure. it turns out that
only certain combination of these tensors is tted for correct description
of perihelion shift. this combination does not coincide with papapetrou-
weinberg tensor.

the investigation of possibilities of phenomenological approach to gravi-
tation without use of general covariance seems to us very promising. valuable
undertaking in this direction was made in [19].

2 thirrings energy-momentum tensor

throughout the paper we use

g =  + h

(1)

in sections 2, 3, 5  = diag(1,1,1,1, ); in sections 4 and 6  =
diag(1, 1, 1, 1, ). in this sec. we use thirrings notation [2]; both greek and
latin indices run from 0 to 3.
the gravitational eld is described by the symmetric tensor h, which
contains spin-2 and lower spins, see, e.g. [3]. the unnecessary spins (spin-1
and one of spin-0) are excluded by hilbert gauge :

h

,  (h

h), = 0,

h = h

,

h, 


x h.

(2)

grangian gr.

one way to obtain thirrings tensor is to start from general relativity la-
if we remove terms with second derivatives of g into
divergence terms and drop the latter, we get the function g(x) in eq.(93.1)
in [16]. retaining in it only quadratic in h terms we get

g(x) =

1

[h,h,  2h,h, + 2h

,h,  h,h,]

this is equivalent to thirrings lagrangian [2]

f 2 = 8g, g = 6.67  108cm3/g  sec2. (5)
using  instead of h is justied because then the analogy with elec-
trodynamics becomes more close:  is analogous to vector- potential a
and has the same dimensionality, mg has the dimensionality of electro-
magnetic charge. we note that the lagrangian (4) exactly corresponds to
schwingers lagrangian [10], who uses the notation  = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, )
and 2hsch

turning now to conservation laws of total energy-momentum we remind
rst how matters stand in general relativity. there the energy-momentum
t  is connected with its counterpart in special

tensor of point-like particles
relativity t  by the relation, see (33.4), (33.5) and (106.4) in [16]:
u = dx/ds,

g is determinant of g. in terms of t  the conservation laws are (see (96.1)

t

(18)

we shall see below that t  h  can be interpreted as (part of) interaction
energy-momentum tensor.

as is known the equation of motion of particles in general relativity

is contained in consevation laws. indeed from

this is equivalent to (19), because [9]

just at such movement of particles the divergence of total energy-momentum

spin part of energy-momentum tensor is conserved by itself and do not con-
tribute to conservation laws :

s

, = 0.

(29)

so from (26) and (28) it follows that the conserved tensor contains in

itself the interaction tensor [2]

int

t  = t h

.

(30)

but it is not symmetric. in order to understand the reason we have to
s
t  in detail despite the fact that it does not take
consider the properties of
part in conservation laws written in the form of eqs.(26) and (28). according
to known rules [2,18] we have

(31)

(32)

the antisymmetric part of (31) is contained only in the last term. for it we
have

the rst two terms on the right hand side symmetrize the interaction tensor,
the last two terms symmetrize the canonical one.

it is not seen directly from (6) and (31) that eld energy-momentum
tensor  in (14) is symmetric. this agrees with the fact that the proof of
symmetry utilizes the euler-lagrange equations for eld which is considered
as free [18]. we are interested in interacting eld. so using linearized einstein
equation (27) with source, we get

j,i!,i

(34)

in the last equation we use the connection between  and h, see (5).
substituting in (30)   j,   k, we see that the sum of (30) and (34) is
symmetric. this result retains if we start from another lagrangian diering
from thirrings one in (6) by divergence because the linearized equation
remains the same.

one should take into account however that the symmetric part of

s
t jk can
also contain terms of interaction type. so for the lagrangian in (6) similarly
to (34) we nd

 f jik

as a result we get for

(35)

(36)

here last but one term, added to
can be rewritten in terms of h in the form, see (9) and (11), (30),

f
t jk, makes it symmetric. the last term

t jk +

(37)

so the symmetrization of
this tensor is nonzero only where particles are present. for newtonian cen-
ters the corresponding energy density

int
t jk in (30) is reduced to its replacement by 1

1
2t 00h = 2t 00

(38)

is positive (contrary to our intuition and) contrary to
and (10), where h and  are given for newtonian centers.

int
t 00 in (30), see (12)

we note that the use of linearized einstein eq. (27) in the expression for
s
t jk leads to that eq. (29) is satised only with considered accuracy. the
presence of interaction energy-momentum tensor means the appearence of

9

such vertex: the energy-momentum tensor of matter together with one of
gravitons serves as a source for other graviton, see fig.1

thirring assumes that his tensor  (see (14), (6), (31)) is an analog of
energy-momentum tensor guring in the r.h.s. of einstein equation when
iteration procedure is used. in other words the nonlinear correction to eld
is given only by diagram (2a) in fig.2. on this fig. the short straight line
has only conditional meaning: it represents the source of gravitons, namely
the energy-momentum tensor build of two gravitons (real or virtual) shown
on fig.2 as joining the ends of this line. the graviton emerging from the
middle of straight line is emitted or absorbed by this source. on diagram
(2a) the energy-momentum tensor is build from gravitons of newtonian cen-
ter. on diagrams (2b) and (2c) one of the virtual gravitons of newtonian
center interact with energy-momentum tensor of two other gravitons. all
three diagrams on fig.2 correspond to one feynman diagram obtained by
contracting the short straight line to a point.

the contribution to nonlinear correction for eld from diagram (2a) is

easy to obtain. indeed, from (14), (6) and (15) we have

(39)

using now the eld equation in hilbert gauge with  from (16) and (39)

h = 16g,  =

(40)

we nd

h00 = 72,

were used. the obtained h satises hilbert condition. going over to h =

3ik
r2 ).

(43)

(2)
h , indicating the order of correction in powers of g, is dropped

index 2 in
for brevity.

finally from (12) and (43) we have

ds2 = g00dt2  (1  2 + 32)ikdxidxk  2 xixkdxidxk

r2

,

the transition to spherical coordinates is given by the relations

g00 = 1 + 2  42.

(44)

(45)

ikdxidxk = dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2),

xixkdxidxk

r2

= (dr)2.

the nonlinear correction 42 in g00 in (45) is of special interest for us. the
correct value necessary to explain the perihelion shift is +22 (if used in
equation for geodesic, see. [19] and sec. 6). the quantity g00 is observable
in principle by redshift [16]  = 0(g00) 1
2 . why the nonlinear correction
in (45) turns out to be negative? it will appear later on that it is caused
solely by the source (15), see eqs.
(95) and (117). the sources (8) and
(15) have dierent signs, but the corresponding elds have the same sign.
the answer is simple. the correction in (45) is only a small (and negative)
part. the larger and positive part goes for converting initially bare mass in
newtonian potential into a dressed one, see eq. (113). now the negative sign
of correction is clear: the mass of newtonian center at innitly large distance
appears as m, but at nite distance the test particle feels a greater mass and
greater attraction, because (15) is negative.

there are some technical problems on how to take into account the con-
tributions from diagrams (2b), (2c) and fig.1. to simplify the problem as
much as possible we may look only into corrections to newtonian poten-
tial. as it will appear in sec.6, it seems impossible to get the right value on
any assumption about the contributions from these diagrams for the case of
thirrings tensor.

we note here that thirring obtained from his tensor the necessary cor-

rection. yet his result is objectionable as he used illdened gauge

2 =

g2m 2

4r2

,

11

see eq. (83) in [2]. namely the source of  fall of too slowly for large r and
the integral in (112), see below, diverge for large r.

in the next two sections we shall see how energy-momentum tensors of

general relativity dier from thirrings tensor.

thirrings interaction tensor, see (37) and text below it.

eld in this approximation is given by

equation 2 = 4g and ignoring the problems connected with point-like
nature of particles, we can write (utilizing integration by parts)

(55)

the density in the integrand on the r.h.s. contains now not only the energy
density of interaction, but also the proper energy density of particles self-
eld. the density on the l.h.s.
is nonzero only at particle locations, the
density on the r.h.s.
is nonzero where the eld is nonzero. the integration
by parts deprive us the possibility to retain the previous physical meaning
of integrand.
if nevertheless we do this, then adding to (13) the energy

the consideration of newtonian approximation makes the following point
of view very enticing: the energy density of an isolated point-like particle
should be positive; hilbert gauge exclude the unnecessary spins and then pos-
itivity seems quite natural, because the presence of virtual gravitons should
not make the energy density negative. the attraction is described by inter-
action energy density and so the latter must be negative. neither thirring
tensor nor landau-lifshitz one satises this requirement. the mtw ten-
sor does. unfortunately i failed to t this idea into existing approach to
gravitation, see sec.6.

from (69) we have h(1)

with (75). as to the nonlinear correction for gik, in (73) it diers from the
one in (76) by a gauge. really, subtracting from hik in (73) the nonlinear

going back to t00 in (70), we note that this density is negative and does
not coincide with any density of other tensors. at the same time the equa-
tion of motion of particles is contained in the conservation laws of total
energy-momentum tensor. we shall check it in considered approximation.

taking into account (25) we see that the r.h.s. of (81) is zero.

now we turn to newtonian approximation. terms of interaction tensor
are contained in both   (three last terms in the r.h.s. of (79)) and in t.
from (64), (66-68), using (49), which preserve its form in the notation of this
section, we nd the following terms of interaction tensor contained in t :

thus in newtonian approximation the interaction terms in the sum of (83)
and (84) are cancelled out. the agreement with newtonian approximation
(56) is achieved in the same way as for landau-lifshitz tensor: t 00 on the
r.h.s. of (84) detaches term (62), which is equivalent (in accordance with
4g ()2. together with the rst term on the r.h.s. of (83) this
(63)) to
gives (56).
weinberg shows in detail that his energy-momentun tensor has all re-
quiered characteristics. but this tensor does not help us to nd energy-
momentum tensor of two gravitons as represented by straight line on dia-
grams of fig.2. by construction weinbergs tensor gives the gravitational
eld only via diagram (2a). the eld-theretical description tell us that test
particle is not quite passive. it does not simply follows the command move
along geodesic but itself takes part in the creation of eld in which it moves,
see fig.1 and fig.(2b, 2c). from this viewpoint one can expect that e.g. pho-
ton and graviton scatter dierently on newtonian center as only in the latter
case all three diagrams of fig.2 contribute.

it is easy to verify that total energy-momentum tensor consisting of (17) and
(92) is conserved.

(94)

for this system the mtw lagrangian (93) coincide with thirrings one.
the same is true for canonical energy-momentum tensors, see (6) and (86-
87), but spin parts are dierent.
it follows from (91) and (87) that for
newtonian centers mtw spin part contributes only to interaction tensor,
while thirrings spin part contributes also to pure eld part, see (15).

we note now that in hilbert gauge for static case (for newtonian centers)

the linearized einstein equation can be written as

(95)
see (116) below. as seen from (87) for this system t00 = 0, i.e. there is no
contribution to h00 from diagrams of fig.2.

 = 16g t,

comparing mtw and thirring tensors in newtonian approximation we
see that addition of divergence terms to lagrangian leads to the change in
subdivision of energy density between purely eld part and interaction part.

6 on schwingers explanation of perihelion

shift

schwiger gave an elementary explanation of perihelion precession [10]. his
method is of interest in many respects. the oered algorithm for calculating

20

gravitational eld is more in line with eld-theoretical method than nding
eld via dierential equation in geometrical approach.
in linear approxi-
mation both methods naturally agree. in higher approximation schwingers
gravitational eld, dened as a coecient at t  in variation of amplitude

w (t ) = z d4xt hsch

 ,

t 

, = 0,

h = 2hsch
 ,

(96)

seems does not coincide with denition of h in (1), because the nonlinear
correction to  is 1
22, but not 2, see the text below eq.(108). in the lowest
approximation

w (t ) = 4gz d4xd4xt (x)d(x  x)t (x), d = pd+(x  x),(97)

d+(x) =

i

2p0 ei(~p~xp0|t|),

(2)3 z d3p
( +   ).

p =

2

(98)

the amplitude w is related to the energy of system e by the expression

w (t ) = z dte(t).

(99)

from the total energy e schwinger singles out the interaction energy eint.
nonlinear correction to the interaction energy of slowly moving planet with
the sun is given then by

(2)

e int = gm z d3x
|~x|

t00int,

where t00int is taken in newtonian approximation

so the result is

t00int =

(100)

(101)

(102)

eq.(100) follows from eq.(4.34) in ch.2 in [10] if one assums that energy-
momentum tensor of gravitational eld is given by 1/8 of the expression (15),

21

in which  is that of (10), i.e. the potential of sun-planet system. the suns
matter energy-momentum tensor is represented by (8). it is clear that (100)
is given by contribution from diagrams (2b) and (2c).

as shown in sec.3 the energy density of gravitational eld may be cosidered

as positive. in that case the expression for
then there is also a contribution from interaction energy density

(2)
e int in (102) changes sign, but

 = 

gmm

r

[(~x) + (~x  ~r)].

(103)

using this instead of t00int in (100) and dropping the contribution from (~x)
(self-interaction is included in renormalization of suns mass) we get

(2)
e int,loc =

g2m 2m

r2

= m2.

(104)

this together with (102), taken with reversed sign, restores schwingers re-
sult. we see that in this way the explanation of perihelion shift is achieved
without the concept of negative energy density of gravitational eld.

so the nonlinear correction to the potential is taken into account by sub-

stitution

  ef f = (1 +

1
2

).

(105)

therefore the newtonian attraction is decreased by this correction. qualita-
tively this result is quite understandable: the correction term describes the
interaction of the sun with negative interaction energy and this corresponds
to repulsion. the eective potential (105) produces the acceleration

d

ef f = (1 + ) = 

gm
r2 (1 

gm

).

(106)

in general relativity the expression for acceleration of particle at rest
depends upon the chosen coordinates. in schwarzschild coordinates we have

,

rg = 2gm,

(107)

see e.g. eqs. (a 61), (a 63) in appendix in [13]. in harmonic coordinates
r = r  rg

and does not contradict (106). we note also that in this coordinates g00 is
given by (75), i.e. the newtonian potential  is substituted by (1 + ).
the dierence with (105) is caused by the fact that schwinger obtained the
correction to  for use in lagrangian method, cf. 106 in [16] and [21], not
for correcting g00. the relation is simple. let us denote by 1
2 and  the
coecients at 2 in corrections to  in g00 and in schwinger method. then
from eq. below (106.15) in [16] we have for particle at rest

l

= q1 + h00  1 +  +(cid:18)

2(cid:19) 2,

where

h00 = 1 + 2 + 2.

so  = 

2  1
2.

now we shall see what is in store for us if we use the diagram method.
first we dwell on properties of graviton propagator (98). the polarization
factor p satises the relations

tp = t 

1
2

t  t, pt  = t,

tpt  = tt 

1
2

tt = t t = tt.

(109)

the scalar factor d+(x) has the representation

d+(x) =

(110)

and possesses the property

z d d+(~x  ~x,  ) =

i

(2)2 z 



d

(~x  ~x)2   2 + i

=

4|~x  ~x|

.

(111)

for spherically symmetric body we have to deal with integrals of the kind

z d4xd+(xx)(r) =

(r) =

23

1

r z r

0

drr2(r)+z 

r
(112)

drr(r),

by the way it is seen from here that the derivative of newtonian potential
over r is determined only by the mass inside sphere of radius r. assuming
in (112) that  = c

r4 , we get

1

r z r



drr2(r) +z 

r

drr(r) = c(cid:18) 1
r 

1

2r2(cid:19) .

(113)

hence the divergent part at small r appears only in the term, which is
absorbed by mass renormalization.

so the source (13) generate the eld

h00 = 16gz d4xd+(x  x)t00(x) = 2.

(114)

the arrow shows that the divergent part is included in mass renormalization.
the r.h.s. of (114) can be obtained also from the solution of wave equation
derived from (114) by action of the operator 2 = 2   2
t2 and taking into
account that

2d+(x  x) = (x  x) , 2 1

r2 =

2
r4 .

we note also that

h = 2hsch

 = 16gz d4xd+(x  x) t(x).

(115)

(116)

first we try mtw energy-momentum tensor as a source of gravitational

eld. the canonical part of mtw tensor in hilbert gauge has the form

f
t  =

32g{h,h

h,h,

 t .

[

h,h, 

for newtonian centers this expression coincides with thirrings one, see
eq.(6). as seen from (117) in this static case t 00 = 0. so there is no
contribution to h00 from this source. as noted in sec.5 the nonlocal part of
s
t  is zero for newtonian centers. so assuming, as in the case of weinberg
tensor, that the contribution from diagrams of fig.1 and (2b), (2c) should
not be taken into account, we cannot obtain g00 necessary for explaining the

24

perihelion shift; even a combination of mtw and thirring tensors will not
help in this case.

thus we have to take into account all diagrams. as we know from general
relativity, where the vertices are known, the extracting post-newtonian cor-
rections from scattering amplitudes is a cumbersome and labour consuming
job [21, 22]. for this reason we assume here the schwinger method.

returning to thirring tensor we nd that the total correction to  from
all diagrams of fig.1-2 is zero. indeed starting from the energy density (56),
schwinger obtained the correction to  as 1
22. therefore the corresponding
contribution from spin part (15) is 42. this correction comes from diagrams
(2b) and (2c). similarly to (103), (104) we nd that the correction to  from
diagram of fig.1 is 22. finally the diagram (2a), treated according to
schwinger method, contributes 22. so we get zero instead of 1
22, necessary
for use in lagrangian method, see 106 in [16].
now it easy to see that a linear combination of mtw and thirring tensors
with weights 1
2 2. as the mtw tensor
alone is unable to explain the perihelion shift, we have to give up the tempting
disire to consider the gravitational energy density of an isolated point-like
center as positive.

4 gives the necessary correction 1

4 and 3

besides the nonlinear correction (102) there is a nonrelativistic linear cor-
rection to the sun-planet interaction energy. all nonrelativistic corrections
have the form [10]

3~p2
2m2 v +

1
2m

v 2 ,

v = m.

(118)

relativistic corrections may be treated either according to schwinger or by
using (118) together with newtonian potential energy v in relativistic equa-
tion of motion in at space, see i.g. ch.5, 1 in [20]. both methods give the
correct result. an elaborate analysis of dierent aspects of planet motion
in this approximation is given in [19]. finally we remind that three other
famous observational eects of general relativity are explained already by
linear approximation [2,10,19].

7 concluding remarks

though general covariance was not assumed, the gauge invarians is of course
retained [2,10]. for this reason the weak gravitatinal waves in at space are

25

described as in general relativity. all considered tensors give the same energy-
momentum tensor for the plane gravitational wave. there are no a priori
reasons to believe that eld-theoretical approach will give the same result
as general relativity. similar assertion was made in [21]. our investigation
shows that there is still much to be done to synthesize the geometrical and
eld-theoretical aspects of gravitations.

i wish to thank v.i.ritus, s.l.lebedev, i.v.tyutin, and m.a.vasiliev for
useful discussions. i am particularly indebted to v.ya. fainberg for remarks
contributing to improvement of the manuscript. this work was supported
