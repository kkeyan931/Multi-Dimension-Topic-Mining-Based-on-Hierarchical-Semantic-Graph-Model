abstract

the existence of intimate relation between generalized statistics and supersymmetry
is established by observation of hidden supersymmetric structure in pure parabosonic
systems. this structure is characterized generally by a nonlinear superalgebra. the
nonlinear supersymmetry of parabosonic systems may be realized, in turn, by modifying
appropriately the usual supersymmetric quantum mechanics. the relation of nonlinear
parabosonic supersymmetry to the calogero-like models with exchange interaction and
to the spin chain models with inverse-square interaction is pointed out.

1 introduction

one of the fundamental and seminal approaches in theoretical physics is a search for sym-
metries. when new symmetry is revealed, this leads not only to better understanding of a
system but sometimes gives rise to establishing unexpected and important relations between
dierent theories and lines of research.

generalized statistics rst was introduced in the form of parastatistics as an exotic pos-
sibility extending the bose and fermi statistics [1]-[4] and for the long period of time the
interest to it was rather academic. nowadays it nds applications in the physics of the
quantum hall eect and (probably) it is relevant to high temperature superconductivity [5].
supersymmetry, instead, unies bose and fermi statistics [6]-[9] and its development lead to
the construction of eld and string theories with exceptional properties [10, 11], that trans-
formed the same idea of supersymmetry in one of the cornerstones of modern theoretical
physics. though supersymmetry and generalized statistics may be unied in the form of
parasupersymmetry [12]-[15], nevertheless, by the construction, the two concepts seem to be
independent.

in this paper we establish the existence of intimate relation between generalized statistics
and supersymmetry by observation of hidden supersymmetric structure in pure parabosonic
systems. this structure is characterized generally by a nonlinear superalgebra. the nonlin-
ear supersymmetry of parabosonic systems may be realized, in turn, by modifying the usual
supersymmetric quantum mechanics. more specically, we investigate hidden supersymme-
tries of the single-mode parabosonic systems described by the hamiltonians of the simplest
quadratic in parabosonic creation-annihilation operators form and show that such simple
systems possess a reach set of n = 1 supersymmetries. depending on the order of a parabo-
son, supersymmetry is realized either linearly in the unbroken or spontaneously broken phase
[8, 9], or in the form of nonlinear symmetry [16]-[19] generalizing for the supersymmetric case
the known nonlinear symmetries of the system of harmonic bosonic oscillators with rational
ratio of frequencies [20]. the basic tool with which we analyze the hidden supersymmetries
of pure parabosonic systems is the so called r-deformed heisenberg algebra (rdha)[21]-
[25], introduced inexplicitly by wigner under generalization of the bosonic oscillator [2] that
lead subsequently to the concept of paraelds and parastatistics [1, 2, 4],[26]-[28]. due to
the rdha structure underlying parabosons, as we shall see, the systems under investiga-
tion turn out to be related to inverse-square interacting particle systems [4, 29, 30], which
are important models of many-body systems because of their exact solvability and intimate
connection to spin chain systems [31] and 2-dimensional yang-mills theories [32]. recently,
this special deformation of heisenberg algebra has found applications for the description
of 3d [33]-[36] and 2d [37] anyons, 3d supersymmetry [35] and higher-spin gauge interac-
tions [38]. it lies also in the basis of the construction of the minimally bosonized version of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics [34, 39, 40].

one of the basic ingredients of supersymmetric quantum mechanics [8, 9] is the z2-
grading operator , 2 = 1, which classies all the operators into even (bosonic, b) and odd
(fermionic, f ) subsets according to the relations [, b] = {, f} = 0. the main idea of the
minimally bosonized supersymmetric quantum mechanics is to take the reection (parity)

(1.5)

these operators together with the reection operator r form the r-deformed heisenberg
algebra,

[a, a+] = 1 + r,

(1.6)
which possesses unitary innite-dimensional representations for  > 1 and at the integer
values of the deformation parameter,  = p 1, p = 1, 2, . . ., is directly related to parabosons
of order p [2, 23, 25]. on the other hand, at  = (2p + 1) the algebra (1.6) has nite-
dimensional representations corresponding to the deformed parafermions of order 2p (see
appendix).

(1.1), (1.2) with w = x  

are supersymmetric: they are described by eqs.
2x . these
systems possess the following property: in the case  = + the spectrum of the hamiltonian
(1.7) does not depend on the value of the deformation parameter  > 1, i.e. eq. (1.7) gives
the isospectral family of supersymmetric systems being in the phase of exact supersymmetry
(e0 = 0). on the other hand, at  =  the hamiltonian (1.7) describes the set of systems in
the phase of spontaneously broken supersymmetry with the scale of supersymmetry breaking
e0 = 1 +  > 0 governed by the value of the deformation parameter  > 1.

here we rst show that at  = 1 the unbroken and spontaneously broken supersymme-
tries of the system (1.7) are the linear supersymmetries of the parabosonic systems described
by the hamiltonians of the simplest form hn = a+a and ha = aa+. then we shall nd
that at  = 2k + 1, k = 1, 2, ..., the same quadratic hamiltonians supply us with a super-
symmetry characterized by nonlinear superalgebra. the peculiarity of linear and nonlinear
supersymmetries of pure parabosonic systems, as we shall see, is encoded in the nature of
their supercharges: being realized in terms of parabosonic creation-annihilation operators
a, they are essentially nonlinear. we shall observe that at the values of deformation pa-
rameter  = 2k corresponding to the parabosons of order p = 2k + 1, the spectra of the
hamiltonians hn and ha have no supersymmetry but possess the interesting structure: they
reveal a nite number of holes in comparison with bosonic spectra ( = 0). this hole num-
ber is correlated with the parastatistics order. it will be shown that with the single-mode
supersymmetric parabosonic systems one can associate the systems of two identical fermions,
which are the simplest two-particle spin chain models with inverse-square interaction. we
shall also discuss the realization of parabosonic supersymmetries by modifying the classical
analog of usual supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

the paper is organized as follows. section 2 is devoted to investigation of the supersym-
metries of the parabosonic systems given by the normal ordered hamiltonian hn = a+a.
section 3 deals with the systems described by the hamiltonian ha = aa+. here, in partic-
ular, we nd the exotic parabosonic system with the spectrum of usual superoscillator [42]
but characterized by the nonlinear superalgebra. section 4 concerns the realization of the
parabosonic supersymmetries in the system of two identical fermions. in section 5 we show
how the nonlinear supersymmetry of pure parabosonic systems may be reproduced by appro-
priate modication of the classical analog of the usual supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
in concluding section 6 we discuss the revealed supersymmetries from the view-point of gen-
eralized deformed oscillator [43], calogero-like models with exchange interaction [4, 30, 44],
reduced parasupersymmetry, and nonlinear nite w -symmetries [19] and give some list of
open problems for further investigation. appendix contains the necessary information on
irreducible representations of rdha and on the relationship of rdha to parabosons and
parafermions.

2 the systems with hamiltonian hn = a+a

let us choose the superpotential in eqs. (1.1), (1.2) in the form

w = x 

1
2x

.

in this case the hamiltonian (1.2) can be represented as the normal ordered product

hn = a+a

(2.1)

(2.2)

of the operators (1.5) corresponding to the particular value of the deformation parameter:
 = 1. this form of the hamiltonian can also be obtained from eq. (1.7) by putting in
it  = + and  = 1. the supersymmetric hamiltonian (2.2) may be written equivalently
as hn = n + , where n is a number operator, [n, a] = a, and  = 1
2(1  r) is

4

a projector (see appendix). from here the spectrum of the normal ordered hamiltonian
(2.2) with a corresponding to the case  = 1 of algebra (1.6) can be immediately obtained:
hn|li = el|li, e0 = 0, e2l1 = e2l = 2l, l = 1, 2, . . .. so, the bosonized supersymmetric
system characterized by superpotential (2.1) is the single-mode parabosonic (of order p = 2)
system with unbroken supersymmetry.

let us take the normal form for the hamiltonian (2.2) in general case of unitary represen-
tations of rdha ( > 1) and investigate its spectrum. in terms of the number operator
we have

the even states |2li are stable eigenstates of hn: their eigenvalues do not depend on the
deformation parameter,

hn = n + .

e

2l = e=0

2l = 2l,

whereas the eigenvalues corresponding to the odd eigenstates |2l +1i are subject to the linear
shift,

e

2l+1 = e=0

2l+1 +  = 2l + 1 + .

there are two special cases given by  = 2k and  = 2k + 1 with k = 1, 2, . . .. for  = 2k
the spectrum of the system (2.2) contains k holes in comparison with the non-deformed
(bosonic) case  = 0: the rst k odd energy levels with e = 2h  1, h = 1, . . . , k, are absent
from it, whereas the rest of the spectrum is the same as for the bosonic system (see fig. 1a).
on the other hand, the odd values of the deformation parameter,  = 2k + 1, supply us
with supersymmetry. as we have seen, at k = 0 the hamiltonian (2.2) describes the system
in the phase of unbroken supersymmetry with one singlet state corresponding to e = 0
and all other states to be paired in supersymmetric doublets. for the parabosons of order
p = 2(k + 1), k = 1, 2, . . ., one gets the nonstandard supersymmetry. it is specied by the
presence of k + 1 singlet states |2li, l = 0, ..., k, with energies e2l = 0, 2, . . . , 2k, whereas
other states are paired in supersymmetric doublets with e2(lk)1 = e2l = 2l, l = k + 1, . . .
(see fig. 1b).

one notes that the case of the nonstandard n = 1 supersymmetry with several sin-
indeed, let us consider the

glet states may be treated as a reduced parasupersymmetry.
parasupersymmetric system described by the hamiltonian

h = b+b + j3 + j.

(2.3)

here b are the bosonic creation-annihilation operators and j3 is one of the su(2) generators
taken in spin-j representation, j2 = j(j + 1), with j = (k + 1)/2, k = 1, 2, . . .. the reduction
of this spin-j parasupersymmetric system by two additional linear constraints

(j3  j)|i = 0,

(j3 + j)|i = 0

with  = 1
the following relations:

2(1  r ). together with the hamiltonian and grading operator r they satisfy

q2 = 0,

{q+, q} = hn + k(r  1),

{r, q} = 0,
[hn, q] = 2kq,

[r, hn] = 0,

[r, q] = 2q, r2 = 1.

this can be understood as a central extension of the supersymmetric algebra (1.3) with the
grading operator r nontrivially included in the set of even generators. only for k = 0 the
odd generators q commute with hn and are the odd integrals of motion (supercharges).
in this case they coincide with the operators q = 1
2(q1  iq2), where q1,2 are constructed
according to (1.1) with w = x  1
2x . therefore, we arrive at the natural question: what are
the supersymmetric generators being odd integrals of motion which mutually transform the
supersymmetric doublet states and what kind of superalgebra do they form? such mutually
conjugate odd operators satisfying the relations {r, q} = 0 are
q = (a)2k+1+.

(2.6)

q+ = (a+)2k+1,

together with the hamiltonian hn they form the following nonlinear superalgebra:

q2 = 0,

{ q+, q} = hk(hn),

[hn, q] = 0,

(2.7)

where

hk(hn) = (hn  2k)(hn  2k + 2)...hn...(hn + 2k  2)(hn + 2k).

this algebra follows immediately from the relations

q+ q = hk(hn)+,

q q+ = hk(hn).

6

the singlet states |0ii  |2ii, i = 0, 1, . . . , 2k, are annihilated by the odd generators, q|0ii =
0, but only the rst state |0i0 = |0i is the zero energy ground state: hn|0i = 0. thus, in the
case  = p  1 = 2k + 1 the supersymmetry of the single-mode parabosonic system (2.2) is
characterized by the presence of k + 1 supersymmetric singlet states and for parabosons of
order p = 4, 6, . . ., unlike the case of p = 2, the corresponding superalgebra is nonlinear.

realizing the creation-annihilation parabosonic operators via eqs. (1.4), (1.5), we repre-

sent the hamiltonians hn = a+a and supercharges (2.6) in the form

(2.8)

(2.9)

with  = 2k + 1. the system given by the hamiltonian (2.8) can be treated as a 2-particle
calogero-like model with exchange interaction, where x has a sense of a relative coordinate
and r has to be understood as an exchange operator. the systems of such type were
considered by polychronakos [4, 30, 44]. therefore, at odd values of the parameter  the
class of calogero-like systems (2.8) possesses a hidden supersymmetry which at  = 1 is the
n = 1 linear supersymmetry in the unbroken phase, whereas at  = 2k + 1, k = 1, 2, ...,
the supersymmetry is characterized by the supercharges being dierential operators of order
2k + 1 satisfying nonlinear superalgebra (2.7).

3 the systems with hamiltonian ha = aa+

let us choose now the superpotential in eqs. (1.1), (1.2) in the form

w = x 

1
2x

.

in this case the hamiltonian can be represented equivalently as the antinormal product

ha = aa+

(3.1)

of the creation-annihilation operators of rdha corresponding to the case of parabosons
of order 2 ( = 1). this antinormal form may be obtained also from the supersymmetric
hamiltonian (1.7) by putting in it  = ,  = 1. the corresponding mutually conjugate
operators q = 1

2(q1  iq2) take now the form

q+ = a++, q = a

(3.2)

instead of supercharges (2.5) of the system (2.2) at  = 1. representing the hamiltonian (3.1)
in the equivalent form ha = n +1++ in terms of the number operator and projector +, we
conclude that it describes the system in the phase of spontaneously broken supersymmetry
characterized by the spectrum el = 2[l/2] + 2, l = 0, 1, . . . , where [.] is the integer part.

let us follow the same line as in the previous section and treat the creation-annihilation
operators in the hamiltonian (3.1) as the generators of rdha for the case of generalized

7

parabosons ( > 1). then, taking into account relation (a.5), one can represent the
hamiltonian as

ha = n + 1 + +.

therefore, the energy levels corresponding to the odd eigenstates |2l + 1i now are stable,
whereas the shift of the levels corresponding to the even eigenstates |2li depends on . special
cases correspond, again, to the integer values of the deformation parameter, when rdha
species parabosons. for the parabosons of odd order p =  + 1 = 2k + 1, k = 1, 2, . . ., the
spectrum is like in the non-deformed case  = 0 but with the only dierence: it contains k
holes in its lower part in comparison with the bosonic system. for odd values  = 2k + 1,
k = 1, . . ., the spectrum looks like the spectrum of usual supersymmetry (k = 1) shifted for
el = e0 = 2, or like that of the nonstandard supersymmetry (k = 2, 3, . . .).

let us consider the case of parabosons of even order p =  + 1 = 4, 6, . . ., and shift the

hamiltonian for the constant corresponding to the lowest energy level, ha  h 0
a,

a = aa+  2.
h 0

(3.3)

then, in the case p = 4 the spectrum of the system looks like the spectrum of the superoscil-
lator [42] being the system in the phase of unbroken supersymmetry with the lowest singlet
zero energy level and all other levels to be supersymmetric doublets. but what are the cor-
responding conserved (commuting with h 0
a) odd supergenerators and what superalgebra do
they form? such mutually conjugate generators for the general case  = p  1 = 2k + 1 are
given by
(3.4)

q+ = (a+)2k+1+,

q = (a)2k+1.

they satisfy the following relations:

where

q+ q = hk(h 0

a),

q q+ = hk(h 0

a)+,

hk(h 0

a) = (h 0

a  2k + 2)  (h 0

a  2k + 4) . . . h 0

a . . . (h 0

a + 2k)  (h 0

a + 2k + 2).

using them, we arrive at the following nonlinear superalgebra which characterizes the system
(3.3) at  = 2k + 1, k = 1, 2, ..., (or the system given by the hamiltonian (3.1) with the
substitution h 0

a = ha  2):

q2 = 0,

{ q+, q} = hk(h 0
a),

[h 0

a, q] = 0.

(3.5)

on the other hand, with the rst order odd generators given by eq. (3.2) the system (3.3)
can be characterized by the following central extension of the n = 1 superalgebra with the
generators q, h 0

a and r:

{q+, q} = h 0

q2 = 0,
a  kr + k + 2,

[r, h 0

{r, q} = 0,
[h 0

a, q] = 2kq,

a] = 0,
[r, q] = 2q, r2 = 1.

therefore, in the case p = 4 the system (3.3) has the usual spectrum of the system in
the phase of exact supersymmetry, but its odd conserving supergenerators form with the
hamiltonian the nonlinear superalgebra:

{ q+, q} = h 0

a(h 0

a + 2)(h 0

a + 4),

[h 0

a, q] = 0,

q2 = 0.

(3.6)

8

note that here the ground (supersymmetric vacuum) state is |vaci = |1i, and, so, it is odd,
r|1i = |1i, whereas |0i belongs to the rst excited supersymmetric doublet. therefore,
this system is not included in the minimally bosonized version of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics where the supersymmetric ground state is always even [40] and this explains
the appearance of the nonlinear superalgebra. the systems with the hamiltonian (3.3)
corresponding to p = 6, 8, . . . are characterized by the same property: their ground state is
odd: |vaci = |1i, h 0
the coordinate realization (1.4), (1.5), results in the following form for the hamiltonian
h 0
a = aa+  2 and supercharges (3.4):

a|vaci = 0.

(3.7)

(3.8)

with  = 2k + 1. therefore, among the calogero-like 2-particle systems with exchange in-
teraction given by the hamiltonian (3.7) the cases corresponding to the odd values of the
parameter  = 3, 5, 7, ... are characterized by the presence of the hidden nonlinear super-
symmetry, whereas the system given by the hamiltonian h 0
a + 2 at  = 1 possesses linear
supersymmetry (1.3) in the spontaneously broken phase. in particular, as we observed, the
calogero-like system (3.7) corresponding to  = 3 is a rather peculiar one: its spectrum coin-
cides exactly with the equidistant spectrum of usual linear superoscillator, but the associated
supercharges (3.8) satisfy in this case the nonlinear superalgebra (3.6).

4 realization of parabosons by two identical fermions

suppose that we have the system of two identical fermions such that its space motion is
conned to the line whereas their spin degrees of freedom are not restricted and are given
by the total vector spin operator with components ji = 1
2(i  1 + 1 i). then, taking into
account the pauli principle and omitting the dependence on the center of mass coordinate,
x = 1
2(x1 + x2), we describe the two-fermion system by the wave functions of the form [40]

(x) = j3

s j3

 (x) + a+(x).
here j3 = 1, 0, 1, x = x1  x2 is the relative coordinate; +1
s = |i|i and
s = 12(|+i|i +|i|+i) are symmetric spin states forming a vector triplet, jijij3
0
s = 2j3
s ,
j3j3
s = j3j3
(|+i|i  |i|+i) is antisymmetric spin-0 singlet state,
jia = 0; j3
 (x) = j3
 (x), and + is an even function, +(x) =
+(x). the physical operators are those transforming the states of the form (4.1) into the
states of the same form. if we assume, moreover, that there is a rotational j 2
3 -symmetry in
the spin space, then the algebra of physical operators may be generated by the operators

3s(a) = +()s(a), i = 0, 1 = , 3 = , is(a) = 0, where we have used
the notation  = 1
let us return to the r-deformed heisenberg algebra. in the coordinate representation an
arbitrary function (x) may be decomposed into even and odd parts, (x) = +(x)+(x),
r(x) = (x). even operators f+(x, d
dx ) map the even and odd functions into the
functions of the same parity nature, whereas odd operators f(x, d
dx ) change the parity of
functions. then, taking into account the properties of operators i and i specied above,
one can arrive at the following identication of the states and operators of rdha on the one
hand, and, on the other hand, of the states and nontrivial physical operators in the j3 = 0
sector of the system of two identical fermions:

together with the operator 3 are the analogs of the creation-annihilation operators (1.5)

{3, a} = 0, 2

3 = i,

which in the sector j3 = 0 are reduced to the relations of rdha (1.6). therefore, all
the obtained results on the supersymmetries of single-mode parabosonic systems can be
translated to the j3 = 0 sector of the system of two identical fermions. then the hamiltonian

described by the hamiltonian (4.3) reveals linear and nonlinear supersymmetries in j3 = 0

sector when the parameter  takes the values  = 1 and  = 3, 5, 7, . . ., respectively. note
that here the states with j3 = 1 always have zero energy. can we modify the hamiltonian
(4.3) in such a way that the innitely degenerated zero energy levels corresponding to j3 = 1
states would be unfrozen without changing the supersymmetric properties of j3 = 0 sector?
a natural modication of the hamiltonian (4.3) is

which acts nontrivially only in the j3 = 1 sector. moreover, this dierence is chosen in
such a way that its action on the states +1
(x) coincides with the action of
the operator h f

corresponding to all odd eigenstates (given by odd functions of x) have a multiplicity equal
to 3. the spectrum of the corresponding two-fermion system is shown in fig. 2a for the case

the energy levels corresponding to odd eigenstates of the hamiltonian (4.6) (represented by
odd functions of x) have also the multiplicity equal to 3 and its spectrum is shown in fig.
2b for the case  = 5.

thus, the supersymmetries of the single-mode parabosonic systems may be realized in
the sector j3 = 0 of the system of two identical fermions. the modied hamiltonians (4.4)
and (4.6) have the form of the hamiltonians corresponding to the simplest 2-particle case
of spin chain models with inverse-square interaction [31]. these hamiltonians unfreeze the
energy levels of the states with j3 = 1 (which for the hamiltonians (4.3) and (4.5) turn out
to be innitely degenerated states of zero energy) leading to the multiplicity equal to 4 for
higher degenerated states.

5 nonlinear supersymmetry in boson-fermion system

nonlinear supersymmetry specic to the pure parabosonic system may also be realized by
the boson-fermion system. to construct such a boson-fermion system with nonlinear super-
symmetry, it is convenient to start from the (pseudo)classical level using the ideas of ref.
[45]. so, let us consider a nonrelativistic particle of unit mass carrying the odd degrees of
freedom described by two grassmann variables a, a = 1, 2. the general lagrangian of such
a system is

l =

1
2

x2  v (x)  l(x) +

a

a,

i
2

where v (x) and l(x) are two arbitrary functions and  = i12 = +,  = 12
(1 i2).
the nontrivial poisson-dirac brackets for the system are {x, p} = 1, {a, b} = iab, and
the hamiltonian h = 1

2p2 + v (x) + l(x) generates the following equations of motion:

x = p,

p = v (x)  l(x),

 = il(x).

let us construct the oscillator-like variables
1
2

b =

(w (x)  ip)

with some function w (x). we nd that

b = iw b 

i
2

(v   w w ) 

i
2

l.

as a consequence, the odd quantities

where k is some natural number, satisfy the following equations of motion:

qk = (b)k,

(5.1)

qk = iqk (kw   l) 

i
2

k(v   w w ).

12

they will be odd integrals of motion if we choose v  = 1
2 (w 2), and put l = kw . therefore,
when the functions v (x) and l(x) are related as l(x) = kw (x), v (x) = 1
2w 2(x)+c, where
c is a real constant, then the odd integrals (5.1) are the integrals of motion additional to h
and . together with the hamiltonian

hk =

1
2

(p2 + w 2) + kw  + c

(5.2)

they form the following nonlinear superalgebra:

{q+

k , qk } = i(hk  c)k,

(5.3)
whereas  is the classical analog of the grading operator, {, qk } = {, hk} = 0. so, the
class of (pseudo)classical systems revealing nonlinear supersymmetry algebra is given by an
arbitrary function w (x):

k } = {qk , qk } = 0,

{hk, qk } = {q+

k , q+

l =

where we have put c = 0.

1

2 (cid:16) x2  w 2(x) + ikw (x)abab + ia a(cid:17) ,

(5.4)

let us consider the simplest example corresponding to the case of linear superpotential
w = x. the quantum hamiltonian of such a system is the sum of the hamiltonians of
harmonic bosonic and fermionic oscillators with the fermionic frequency being the integer
multiple of the bosonic one:

hk = hb + khf , hb = b+b, hf = f +f.

(5.5)

in the case k = 1 the system is a superoscillator [42] for which the quantum analog of
superalgebra (5.3) is given by eq. (1.3). for k = 2, 3, . . . the quantum analog of superalgebra
(5.3) for the system (5.5) takes the form similar to the nonlinear superalgebra of parabosonic
system (2.7) or (3.5):

{q+

k , qk } = h(h  1) . . . (h  k + 1).

the boson-fermion system (5.5) possessing the nonlinear supersymmetry of the type we have
revealed in the single-mode parafermionic systems is analogous to the system of bosonic
oscillators with rational ratio of frequencies, which, in turn, is characterized by the nonlinear
nite w -symmetry [20, 19].

for the superpotential w (x) dierent from the linear one the commutator of operators
b+ and b is nontrivial and in general case this leads to the quantum anomalies destroying
the classical nonlinear supersymmetry [46].

the hole structure specic for the parabosonic systems (2.2) and (3.1) at  = 2k may
also be reproduced by the simplest boson-fermion system in the obvious way: the spectrum
of the hamiltonian h = 2[b+b + (k + 1
2)f +f] reveals k holes in comparison with the
spectrum of the bosonic number operator hb = b+b.

6 discussion and outlook

to conclude, let us discuss the obtained results and indicate the problems that deserve further
attention.

13

we have found that the single-mode systems of parabosons of even order with the hamil-
tonians hn = a+a and ha = aa+ possess the usual or nonstandard supersymmetries.
these supersymmetries are characterized by the superalgebra of the form (1.3) linear in the
hamiltonian, or by the nonlinear superalgebras (2.7) or (3.5). the peculiar nature of the
revealed supersymmetries is encoded in the structure of the corresponding conserved odd op-
erators (2.6) and (3.4). they contain the projectors , which in terms of the parabosonic
creation-annihilation operators may be represented as

+ = cos2 f,  = sin2 f, f =


4{a+, a},

where we have used eqs. (a.3) and (a.4) and taken into account that  = 2k + 1. therefore,
the conserved odd supercharges are essentially nonlinear operators of a.

the r-deformed heisenberg algebra, with the help of which we have analyzed hidden
supersymmetries of the single-mode parabosonic systems, can be characterized in accordance
with eqs. (a.5), (a.4) by the relations

a+a = f (n),

aa+ = f (n + 1),

(6.1)

where f (n)  n(1)n +  sin2 n
bosonic hamiltonians hn and ha is hidden in the relation

2 . the discussed supersymmetric structure of the para-

f (2n + 1) = f (2n +  + 1),

 = 2k + 1,

k = 0, 1, . . . .

(6.2)

rdha can be treated as a particular case of the so called generalized deformed oscillator
algebra [43] given by the relations (6.1), by commutation relations characterizing the number
operator, [n, a] = a, and by the structure function f (0) = 0, f (n) > 0, n = 1, ..., being
an analytic function. therefore, it is interesting to investigate in the context of hidden
supersymmetries the general class of single-mode generalized deformed oscillator systems
whose characteristic functions have the property of degeneracy analogous to (6.2). the rst
results in this direction have been obtained recently by observation of the hidden linear and
nonlinear supersymmetries in parafermionic type systems (whose characteristic functions are
characterized by additional relation f (p + 1) = 0) [47].

we saw that the realization of the creation-annihilation parabosonic operators via eqs.
(1.4), (1.5) results in representation of the hamiltonians hn = a+a and h 0
a = aa+  2
in the form (2.8), (3.7), which may be treated as 2-particle calogero-like models with ex-
change interaction. the obtained results say that the odd values of the coupling constant
 characterize the special subclass of such calogero-like models possessing the hidden su-
persymmetries. these supersymmetries are described generally by nonlinear superalgebras.
to our knowledge, the nonlinear supersymmetries is a new feature of calogero-like systems
with exchange interaction not observed earlier. therefore, it is interesting to generalize the
systems (2.8), (3.7) for the n-particle case, n > 2, (by introducing the set of corresponding
exchange operators [30, 4]) to reveal the possible hidden nonlinear supersymmetric structure
in n-particle calogero-like models with exchange interaction. as in the 2-particle case (2.8),
(3.7), the peculiar nature of such supersymmetries has to be encoded in the bosonized struc-
ture of the supercharge operators which have to depend explicitly on exchange operators and
generally will be higher order operators in derivatives /xi (see eqs. (2.9), (3.8)).

14

we have observed that the spectrum of supersymmetric parabosonic systems character-
ized by the presence of several supersymmetric singlet states may be reproduced by the
reduced parasupersymmetry. the interesting problem is nding the classical analog for the
reduced parasupersymmetry. the corresponding classical systems may be realized with the
usage of paragrassmann variables, and the reduction conditions (2.4) will appear as the
quantum analogs of classical rst-class constraints. such a scheme of obtaining nonlinear
supersymmetries by reduction of the appropriate parasupersymmetric systems will be anal-
ogous to the poisson reduction of the kirillov poisson structure, with the help of which the
nonlinear nite w -algebras are constructed [19].

we have shown that the r-deformed heisenberg algebra and the associated supersym-
metries of the single-mode parabosonic systems are realizable in the j3 = 0 sector of the
system of two identical fermions. the correspondence is one-to-one and the crucial role is
played here by the pauli principle. on the other hand, by analogy with relations (4.2), one
can realize the operators a and r as

a =

1
2

1"x   d

dx 


2x

3!# , r = 3.

(6.3)

operators (6.3) satisfy the relations of rdha (1.6), but such a realization is reducible.
this is clear just from the observation that the operator r = (1)n 3, with n constructed
according to eq. (a.3), commutes with all the operators (6.3).
though we have seen that the nonlinear superalgebra may be reproduced via the appro-
priate modication of the classical analog of the usual supersymmetric quantum mechanics,
nevertheless the quantum systems obtained after quantization are dierent from the su-
persymmetric pure parabosonic systems. indeed, in supersymmetric quantum mechanical
systems there are independent fermionic f and bosonic b operators. proceeding from
the parabosonic operators a one can also construct the operators b and f satisfying the
(anti)commutation relations [b, b+] = 1, { f, f +} = 1, f2 = 0, but they will not be inde-
pendent: [b, f] 6= 0 (see refs. [39, 34]). one can show [46] that the parabosonic systems
with nonlinear supersymmetry may be related to the nonlinear supersymmetric quantum
mechanical analog of classical systems (5.2) in the same way as the minimally bosonized
version of supersymmetric quantum mechanics with its linear supersymmetry (1.3) is re-
lated to the usual supersymmetric quantum mechanics, i.e. via the special nonlocal unitary
transformation applied to the latter with subsequent reduction to a subspace of one of the
eigenstates of the total reection operator [40].

among the quantum systems corresponding to the modied classical analog of super-
symmetric quantum mechanics (5.4), one can nd anomaly-free subclasses of the systems
with nonlinear superpotential [46]. investigating them, we hope to establish a relationship
between nonlinear supersymmetry observed here and the known construction of the hierar-
chy of hamiltonians related by linear supersymmetry, which plays important role in some
integrable systems [9]. since the nonlinear supersymmetry of the boson-fermion system (5.5)
is a super-analog of the nonlinear symmetry of the system of bosonic oscillators with rational
ratio of frequencies [20, 19], investigation of the anomaly-free quantum systems correspond-
ing to the classical systems (5.4) with nonlinear superpotential w (x) attracts also attention
from the view-point of nonlinear nite w -symmetries.

a appendix: irreducible representations of rdha

here we give some information on rdha and its representations, which is necessary for
understanding the main text. the details and further references may be found in [25].

as a consequence of eqs. (1.6), the operators a obey the trilinear commutation relations

[{a, a+}, a] = 2a.

(a.1)

if one denes the vacuum state as a|0i = 0, r|0i = |0i, h0|0i = 1, than eq. (1.6) gives the
relation
(a.2)
for integer values of the deformation parameter  = p  1, p = 1, 2, . . ., the relation (a.2)
together with the trilinear relations (a.1) species the creation-annihilation operators of
the parabosons of order p, whereas for non-integer  > 1 (see below) the operators a
satisfying relations (1.6) may be treated as the creation-annihilation operators of generalized
parabosons [23].

aa+|0i = (1 + )|0i.

the trilinear relations (a.1) can be represented equivalently as {g, a} = 0, g =
[a, a+]  1. as a consequence, [g2, a] = 0, and one concludes that in irreducible represen-
tation g2 = const. if, moreover, g is hermitian operator, then g = r with {r, a} = 0,
r2 = 1 and   r. in other words, the trilinear relations themselves lead to rdha (1.6).
relations (a.1) mean that up to the additive constant the number operator is given by
a half of anticommutator of a+ and a. the commutator from eq. (1.6) together with the
specied above denition of vacuum state xes the additive constant and we get the number
operator

n =

1
2{a+, a} 

1
2

in its terms, the reection operator can be realized as

r = (1)n = cos n.

(1 + ).

(a.3)

(a.4)

with relations (1.6) and (a.3), the normal and antinormal products of the creation-
annihilation operators can be given in terms of the number operator as follows:

a+a = n + ,

aa+ = n + 1 + +,

(a.5)

2 (1  r) are the projector operators, 2


where  = 1
+ = +, + = 0,
+ +  = 1.
from the requirement hn|ni > 0, |ni  (a+)n|0i, n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., it follows that rdha has
unitary fock-type representations when  > 1. in this case the orthonormal eigenstates
of the number operator are given by |ni = cn(a+)n|0i, cn = ([n]!)1/2, [n]! = qn
l=1[l],

= , 2

16

[l] = l + 1
2 (1  (1)l). for integer values  = k, k = 0, 1, . . ., these representations are
equivalent to the fock representation for parabosons of the corresponding order p = k + 1.
let us turn to the schrodinger (coordinate) representation. here, in correspondence with
eq. (1.5), we have 2a = x + d
2x r. then the ground state, specied by the conditions
r0 = 0, a0 = 0, is given by the function 0(x) = |x|/2 exp(x2/2)n , where n is a
normalization constant. with the scalar product dened by

dx  

we get

1(x)2(x)dx,

(a.6)



(1, 2) = z +
(0, 0) = 2n 2z 

|x| exp(x2)dx.

0

the integral is converging (at lower limit) i  > 1, i.e.
the ground state is given by
the normalizable function only for  > 1. therefore, one concludes that in fock and
schrodinger representations singularity of   1 reveals itself in dierent ways. in fock
representation for  = 1 the state |1i has a zero norm, h1|1i = 0, whereas for  <
1 there appear the states with negative norm (in particular, h1|1i < 0). in schrodinger
representation, the ground state is not normalizable for   1 with respect to the usual
scalar product (a.6).
for the sake of completeness we note that the algebra (1.6) reveals some universality
for the special values  = (2p + 1), p = 1, 2, . . ., it has non-unitary nite-
[25, 35]:
dimensional representations characterized by the relations (a)2p+1 = 0. one can pass over
to the hermitian conjugate operators f = a, f + = ra+. they generate the parafermionic
algebra of order p = 2 (for  = 3), or supply us with the deformation of parafermions of
order p = 4, 6, . . ., which contains the internal z2-grading structure:

[[f +, f]f] = 2(2i3  1)rf,

r = (1)i3+p,

i3 =

1
2

[f +, f]  (1)

2 [f +,f ]+p.
