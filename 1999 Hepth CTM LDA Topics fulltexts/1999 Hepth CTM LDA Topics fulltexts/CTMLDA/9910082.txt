special case momentum along eective string equal added energy, i.e., one excites right moving modes, unbroken supersymmetry. momentum along string like another charge, black string remains extremal. case, one show number supersym- metric states depend coupling. entropy turns agree even 2 supersymmetry broken, e.g., excite equal amounts left right mov- ing modes {$9602043$}. even importantly, spectrum hawking radiation also agrees {$9606185$}. situation claried maldacena {$9711200$} took low energy limit decoupled excitations branes excitations strings branes. strong coupling, limit corresponded considering strings moving close horizon black p-brane. cases interest, excitation branes described conformal eld theory (cft), near horizon geometry extremal black p-brane product anti de sitter (ads) space sphere. example, case three brane, geometry ads5 5 radii curvature equal. one-brane ve-brane system, near horizon geometry ads3 3 4. since conformal eld theory well dened even strong coupling, obtain two dierent descriptions valid range parameters. lead maldacena famous ads/cft correspondence. one adds energy system, spacetime exactly ads, still approaches asymptotically. correspondence says string theory spacetimes asymptotically approach ads times sphere completely described conformal eld theory. growing evidence support remarkable conjecture {$9412184$}. explain entropy results? case three-brane, easy see eld theory side entropy might change weak strong coupling. increase coupling constant add potential energy state increase energy, number states given total energy goes down. similarly, gravity side one understand change entropy follows. near horizon geometry near extremal solution black hole ads. lower string coupling, spacetime curvature increases string units. results stringy corrections geometry, hence corrections black hole entropy. light eects, one would expect weak coupling strong coupling results related complicated way. fact related simple factor 3/4 rather mysterious still understood. contrast, one-brane ve-brane system, one 1 + 1 dimensional cft whose entropy depends central charge. computed exactly, independent coupling constant. gravity side, near horizon geometry turns product three dimensional btz black hole {$9510017$} 3 4. 3 locally space constant curvature probably receive string corrections g 0 {$9602135$}. systems entropy computed exactly without supersymmetry, including near extremal four dimensional black holes. far know, cases corresponding eld theory 1 + 1 dimensional cft near horizon geometry space constant curvature. (when unbroken supersymmetry, entropy reproduced wider class black holes, including higher order corrections bekenstein hawking entropy {$9904005$}.) light ads/cft correspondence, begin translate questions black hole physics questions eld theory. example, formation large black hole ads exotic process cft. corresponds eld theory evolution special high energy state typical (approximately thermal) state. importantly, formation evaporation small black hole ads described usual unitary evolution eld theory. 2. misconceptions come rst possible misconception, involves small black holes ads. let r+ denote horizon radius, r denote radius ads. temperature black hole ads decreases mass r+ r, increases mass r+ r. large black holes positive specic heat stable. small black holes negative specic heat one often concludes unstable evaporate. however, let us compare entropy small black hole entropy amount energy thermal gas. consider case black holes ads5 5. since magnitude curvature 5 ads5, gas radiation eectively ten dimensional. since curvature ads acts like conning box side r, gas 9r9 e 10r9, sgas (re)9/10 (2.1) small black hole ads5 uniform 5 unstable localizing 5 due gregory-laamme instability {$9601029$}. use ten dimensional black holes sbh r8 +/8 p, p, n measure large 5 implies sbh er+. let r8 n 28 (or ads5) planck units. (in ads/cft correspondence, n p (where p ten dimensional planck scale) e r7 +/8 appears group su (n ), since asking pure supergravity question, 4 dont need introduce string theory gauge theory quantities.) entropies equal implies sbh n 2r8 + r8 (re)9/10 (cid:18) n 2r7 r7 (cid:19) + 9/10 . r+ r 1 n 2/17 (2.2) (2.3) made arbitrarily small large n . words, r+/r > n 2/17, black hole entropy gas ads. evaporation would violate second law thermodynamics. happens? x temperature, small black hole high temperature simply absorb energy heat bath turns large black hole temperature stable. rather unphysical since hard connect heat bath ads, right boundary conditions black hole evaporates. one instead x total energy, consider system consisting black hole radiation. clear start energy black hole radiate small amount , sbh sg 9/10. sg + sbh > 0 increase total entropy starting radiate. consequence negative specic heat. see nal outcome, must maximize total entropy given energy. let us divide total energy part gas, part black hole: e = eg + ebh. crude approximation, assume entropy gas would absence black hole. may justied since considering small black holes. total entropy (egr)9/10 + ebh(ebh8 p)1/7 (2.4) using 8 p r8/n 2, second term becomes (e 8 bhr8/n 2)1/7. extreming keeping total energy xed yields e 7 g e 10 bh n 20 r17 (2.5) since left hand side maximum eg ebh, clearly need er > n 20/17 order stable equilibrium. (one easily check equivalent earlier condition r+/r > n 2/17.) condition satised, two extrema entropy, local maximum ebh > eg local minimum ebh < eg. er n 20/17, ratio eg/ebh small maximum entropy conguration. net result x total energy, black holes 5 evaporate slightly quickly come equilibrium hawking radiation1. similar earlier studies black hole box. simple check result following. order black hole stable equilibrium radiation, large enough evaporate radiation chance see background curvature. words, lifetime black hole must larger r. easy check stable regime, black holes satisfy condition. ignoring background curvature, lifetime small ten dimensional black hole computed de dt 10r8 + 1 r2 + (2.6) +/r8. order r since e r7 r+/r n 2/9. since n 2/9 n 2/17 large n , much smaller lower p, lifetime t0 r9 +/8 +/8 p n 2r9 bound black hole stable equilibrium. context string theory, another thing check whether size black hole remains bigger string scale s. since smallest stable black hole r+/r n 2/17, r4 gn 4 r+ larger provided gn > n 8/17. s, see similar calculation eleven dimensions shows black holes entropy gas radiation provided r+/r > (p/r)9/19 p eleven dimensional planck scale. second possible misconception concerns relation ads radius scale size cft. poincare coordinates, ads metric simply ds2 = r2 r2 (dt2 + dxidxi) + r2 r2 dr2 (2.7) since metric invariant r r, (t, xi) 1(t, xi), often assumed radial position ads reected scale size corresponding excitation eld theory. checked certainly true many cases, usually involving static congurations. particularly simple example seemed null particle moving radially ads. produces gravitational shock wave reected eld theory < > concentrated null cone {$9602051$}. expanding excitation cft correlated decreasing radial position. however, ask happens particle changes orbit inside ads. answer turns 1 rened version discussion {$9602043$}. 6 < > continues grow speed light even particle stops radius r! essentially consequence causality: < > determined asymptotic form spacetime metric, metric causally related null particle. letting z = r2/r, (2.7) becomes ds2 = r2 z2 (dt2 + dxidxi + dz2) (2.8) particle initially falling = xi = z = 0 inuence elds inside future light cone t2 xixi + z2. point boundary z = 0, = t0, xi = x0 )2 + z2. looking aected events inside past light cone (t0 t)2 (xi x0 intersection two sets, clear maximum z value particle aect asymptotic eld t0, x0 zmax = 1 2 1/2 (2.9) )2 (t0)2, i.e., one approaches occurs = t0/2 xi = x0 light cone boundary, zmax 0. means even particle, better yet, rocket ship, stops constant value z inside ads, eld continue /2. therefore, (x0 grow along light cone boundary. course changing trajectory inside produce additional gravitational waves result change expectation value stress tensor inside light cone. main lesson that, dynamical processes, size disturbance boundary always measure radial position particle interior. (for examples phenomenon, see {$9606185$}.) 3. quasinormal modes spherical black hole adsd described ds2 = f (r) dt2 + f (r)1dr2 + r2 d2 d2 f (r) 1 + r2 r2 (cid:16) r0 r (cid:17)d3 .
