soluble eld theory with a massless gauge invariant limit

it is shown that there exists a soluble four parameter model in (1+1) dimensions all of whose
propagators can be determined in terms of the corresponding known propagators of the vector
coupling theory. unlike the latter case, however, the limit of zero bare mass is nonsingular and
yields a nontrivial theory with a rigorously unbroken gauge invariance.

since quantum eld theories in (3+1) dimensions have not been amenable to exact calculation in any but the most
trivial cases, the study of the soluble eld theories in (1+1) dimensions has been one of considerable interest.
it
originated over forty years ago with thirrings observation [1] that a current-current interaction should be exactly
soluble in such a space inasmuch as the current operator must have both vanishing divergence and curl. a solution
of the model was given by johnson [2] who realized that an essential ingredient had to be a very precise denition of
the current operator. he adopted an approach in which the current is realized as an average of spacelike and timelike
limits of the product of two eld operators. such an averaging process allowed a covariant result to be obtained, but
introduced the somewhat undesirable feature of a timelike limit which does not t comfortably into a cauchy initial
value formulation.

the most general solution of the thirring model was obtained by the author [3] using an extension of schwingers
gauge invariant denition of the current j. specically, one writes, in the case of a charged fermion (x) coupled to
an external eld a(x)[4]

j(x) = lim

where the dirac matrices 0 and 1 = 5 are conveniently taken to be the unit matrix and the pauli matrix 3,
respectively, and the limit is taken from a spacelike direction. although the parameters  and  are required by
lorentz invariance to satisfy the constraint

 +  = 1,

it is desirable for symmetry reasons to retain both parameters in the general formulation. worth noting is that
 = 1( = 1) corresponds to vector (axial-vector) conservation while the choice  =  = 1
2 turns out to be equivalent
to the johnson solution.

among the most well known of the two-dimensional models is the schwinger model [5] which is simply qed for
a massless fermion. its solution nally put to rest the widely held view that gauge invariance necessarily required
a massless photon. the extension of the schwinger model to the massive vector meson case was carried out by
sommereld [6], brown [7], and the author [8] for the cases  = 1

2 ,  = 1, and arbitrary  respectively.

a model in which only a single component of the fermion eld was coupled via the current operator to a massive
vector meson was subsequently proposed and solved by the author [9]. this single component model has the same
greens functions as one which was subsequently proposed by jackiw and rajaraman [10]. the latter formulation
has been referred to as the chiral schwinger model, a somewhat unfortunate description inasmuch as the propagator
equations of motion are inconsistent with zero bare mass for the photon [11].

the nal extension of the model to date was accomplished with the proposal [12] that the model be generalized to
include arbitrary admixture of vector and axial vector couplings. this was subsequently solved [13] with the denition
(1) generalized to

j = lim

functional derivatives with respect to the external sources a and j can be used to obtain a complete solution.
worth noting is the fact that this model has four parameters two of which (namely, e and 0) appear explicitly in the
lagrangian while two more ( and r) occur only in the denition of the current operator (2).

perhaps the most striking feature of the solution is the mass spectrum of the model. in addition to a massless mode

there is a renormalization of the mass 0 which is given by

2 = 2

0

[1 + (e2/2

0)(1  r2)][1  (e2/2
1  (e2/2

0)(r2 + ),

(4)

in agreement with results obtained in refs.[1-3,5-11] for special cases of the four parameters of the model. of particular
interest is the case r2 = 1 considered in [9] and [10] for which the physical mass reduces to

2 = 2

0(cid:20)1 

e2
2

0(cid:21)1

.

this result clearly precludes one of the most interesting possible limits, namely the case 0 = 0 (i.e., a chiral theory
with gauge invariance). while the very dierent calculational approach of [10] argues for the possibility of that limit,
it concludes with the essentially equivalent result that gauge invariance is necessarily broken as a consequence of an
anomaly. in this work a new model is proposed which, like that of [13], is a four parameter one, but which allows the
chiral r2 = 1, 0 = 0 limit without either destroying gauge invariance or requiring tachyonic modes.

one begins with the lagrangian

(5)

which for g = 0 and vanishing sources a and j is recognized to be the lagrangian of a massless fermion coupled
to a scalar eld of mass 0. the equations of motion have the form

while the nonvanishing equal time commutators are

and

[0(x), (x)] = i(x  x

)

{(x), (x)} = (x  x

).

to display the close connnection between (3) and (5) the former is rewritten as lv which is then expressed in terms
of new elds  and  according to

and the fact that the exponential which appears in the denition (2) of the current operator is invariant under the
simultaneous replacements r  r1 and a  r a, one infers that

this allows lv to be rewritten as

 j(r, a) = rj(

thereby establishing a complete equivalence between the two models. specically, the vacuum-to-vacuum transition
amplitudes h01|02is,v are seen to satisfy the relationship

h01|02is,g,r(a, j ) =
h01|02iv,e=gr0, 1

r (r a , 0j ).

corresponding results for the 2n-point fermion propagators gs,g,r(x1, ...x2n; a, j ) can be written in the form

gs,g,r(x1, ...x2n; a, j )

= gv,e=gr0, 1

r (x1, ...x2n; ra , 0j ).

clearly eq.(6) allows a calculation of the nonvanishing bosonic mass in the model by letting r  1
in (4). the result is

(8)

thereby clearly displaying the nonsingularity of the 0  0 limit [14]. it should be noted that all of the usual limits
which can be taken in the model described by lv have their counterparts in the ls theory. thus, for example, a three
parameter thirring model is obtainable in the 0   limit with the more usual two parameter model emerging in
the subsequent limits r = 0 and r  , gr nite.

to illustrate how the calculation of matrix elements is to be carried out one can simply note that the current

correlation function d

s (x  x) for example is given by

d

s (x  x) = i

a(x)a (x)

lnh01|02is|a=j =0

which by (6) reduces to

this readily yields from [13] the result

d

s (p) = r2dv

(p)|1/r

e=gr0 .

d

s (p) = (g + r)(g + r) [d1(p)p p
+d2(p)pp + d3(p)(pp + pp)]

where

d1(p) =

with d(p) = 1/p2, (p) = 1/(p2 + 2), and 2 given by eq.(8).

also of considerable interest are the propagators of the elds  and . the former is obtained from the corre-

sponding result of the vector theory[13] according to

upon using the equations of motion and the commutation relations [15] in the case 0 6= 0 the  propagator is then
found to be

which readily reduces to

gs(p) =

+ ppg

s (p),

gs(p) =

(p).

thus the  propagator is seen to dier from that of the free theory merely by wave function and mass renormalizations.
since the propagators of the model are all nite in the limit of vanishing bare mass, the solution of the  = 0 case
can be obtained merely by taking this limit. in some respects this is the analogue of the schwinger model but diers in
that by eq.(8) the physical mass is zero. a further point of dierence is that in the vector theory there is consistency
only for the cases r =  = 0 (the usual schwinger model) and r  , er nite,  = 0 (the axial schwinger model). in

4

the theory presented here no restrictions need to be placed on the parameters g, r, and  and the propagators reduce
to the form

and

g

s (p) =

1  g2

 ( + r2)

(pp  p2g)d(p)

gs(p) =

[1  (g2/)(1  r2)][1 + (g2/)(1  r2)]

1  (g2/)( + r2)

d(p).

this is clearly a massless gauge theory which has the property of being invariant under the gauge transformation

where 0 is a constant[16]. the theory thus supports the broken symmetry condition[17]

h0|(x)|0i = 0,

   + 0

in stark contrast to the model considered in [9] and [10]. it should also be noted that there is no diculty in passing
to the chiral limit r2 = 1 with the particularly simple results

and

g

s (p) =

1

1  (g2/)

(pp  p2g)d(p)

gs(p) =

1

1  (g2/)

d(p).

the fermionic two point function for this massless chiral theory is readily seen from eq.(7) to be

gs,g,r(x  x; a = j = 0)

= exp{ig2

1

1  (g2/)

(1  5)2[d(x  x)  d(0)]}.

in conclusion it should be remarked that the model presented here has the advantage of being fully soluble and
contains a wealth of submodels obtainable by taking appropriate limits in the relevant parameter space. in contrast to
the case of the related vector models where the limit of vanishing bare mass and chiral currents leads to inconsistencies
and/or breaking of the gauge symmetry, no such problems are encountered in the theory presented here. this leads
one to hope that it may well prove to be a more reliable theoretical laboratory than some of the alternative soluble
two dimensional theories.

[14] equation (6) suggests that the dependence upon 0 is essentially trivial, serving only to set the mass scale. the complete

for the mass).
