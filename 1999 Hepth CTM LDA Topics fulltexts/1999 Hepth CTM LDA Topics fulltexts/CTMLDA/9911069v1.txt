abstract

the electrogravity transformation is applied to the three-dimensional ein-
stein eld equations to obtain new multi-parameter families of black hole
solutions. the banados-teitelboim-zanelli black hole is shown to be a special
case of one of these families. the causal structure, associated matter, as well
as the mechanical and thermodynamical properties of some of the solutions
are discussed.

three-dimensional (3d) gravity provides an excellent arena for learning about quantum
eects of gravity in a simplied context [1].
it helps that this theory, with a negative
cosmological constant, , has non-trivial solutions, such as the banados-teitelboim-zanelli
(btz) black hole spacetime [2], which provide important testing grounds for such studies. a
few other 3d black hole solutions have also been found by coupling matter elds to gravity
in dierent ways [3].

however, non-trivial solutions in 3d are relatively less compared to general relativity
(gr) [4]. this is due to the lack of gravitational interaction in the theory: unlike its 4d
counterpart, localized matter here cannot by itself give rise to many interesting solutions,
such as black holes. in this paper we report the nding of two multi-parameter families of
black hole solutions in 3d einstein gravity, with (and without) a negative , and in the
presence of dierent types of matter. one of these families includes the btz hole as a
particular case. we use the electrogravity transformation (egt), recently proposed in
the context of gr [58], to obtain our solutions.

the egt is dened as the interchange of active and passive electric parts of the rie-
mann curvature tensor. this exactly translates into the interchange of ricci and einstein
tensors [5]. it is a duality transformation for the vacuum eld equations since it leaves them
invariant. in this work, a pair of spacetimes will be termed as related by egt if they arise
as solutions to the equations fi(gab) = 0 and fi(rab) = 0, respectively, where fi denotes a
pre-dened set of functions. note that these spacetimes may arise as solutions to dierent
matter distributions, in general. however, their choice can be restricted by suitably specify-
ing the forms of fi and, therefore, the eld equations that they correspond to (as discussed
below). by a common abuse of nomenclature, equations related by egt and, therefore,
their respective solutions, will be termed as dual to each other. we follow the conventions
of wald [10] and employ the units, g = 1/8 and c = 1. specically, the metric signature
for 3d spacetimes is (, +, +). the convention for the totally antisymmetric levi-civita
tensor, abc, is such that, 012 = 1.
following [5], we dene the active electric part of the riemann tensor relative to a timelike
unit vector as, eac = rabcdubud, which is a purely spatial, symmetric tensor. the double-
dual of the riemann tensor in 3d, namely, rac, is dened as r a
pq,
c. it can be used to construct the following three-vector:
which is just the einstein tensor ga
pquc. the spatial projection of ga is the 3d analogue of the
ga = ga
magnetic part. it is dened as ea = gbhb
a, where hab is the spatial metric, hab = gab + uaub,
with gab being the spacetime metric and habua = 0. thus, eac and ea account for ve of
the six independent components of the riemann tensor. the remaining component is the
temporal part of ga, namely, gaua, which is the 3d analogue of the passive electric part.

the ricci tensor can be decomposed in terms of eab, gab, and their various projections

as follows:

rab = eab + (gcuc)hab + euaub  ( eaub + ebua) ,

where e is the trace of eab. on the other hand, the einstein tensor can be written as

gab = eab + ehab + (gcuc)uaub  ( eaub + ebua) .

the transformation

e  (gcuc) ,

(3)

interchanges the ricci and the einstein tensors and, therefore, eects an egt. requiring
that the spatial and temporal components of the vacuum eld equations, rab = 0, vanish
separately, gives:

 eab + (gcuc)hab = 0 ,
ea = 0 ,

and

either e = 0

or

(gcuc) = 0 .

(4a)
(4b)
(4c)

the above set of six equations is invariant under egt. flat spacetime is the unique solution
of these equations.

consider a circularly symmetric spacetime (css) with the line element:

if the eld equations,

ds2 = a(r)dt2 + b(r)dr2 + c(r)d2 .

r2

2 = 0 , r1

1 = r0

0 ,

(5)

(6)

are obeyed everywhere, then it implies that such a spacetime with c = r2 (or, alternatively,
ab = 1) has to be at (vacuum). the above eld equations are less restrictive in form than
the equation rab = 0. in fact they follow from a simple requirement on the matter energy
density,  = tabuaub, and the convergence density of a family of radial null-geodesics,
n  tabkakb, with ka being the tangent along such a geodesic; it is:

 = 0 ,

and n = 0 ,

(7)

everywhere. also the convergence density of a family of timelike geodesics is dened as
t = (tab  gabt /2)uaub.

since the egt implies rab  gab, its action on eq. (6) gives,

g2

2 = 0 , g1

1 = g0

0 .

(8)

alternatively, the above equations can be obtained by implementing the transformation
  t, n  n on the equations (7). for c = r2 (or, alternatively, ab = 1), the above
equations imply:

a = r +  = b1 ,

(9)

for r > 0. here  and  are integration constants. for  = 0 and  > 0, the above
solution is a locally at spacetime with a decit angle. it describes the spacetime region
around a massive point particle [4]. it can also describe a region of spacetime outside an
electromagnetic wave with compact support, which arises as a solution to the 3d einstein-
maxwell system [12]. on the other hand, if  < 0, then in the limit   0, the resulting
spacetime is identical to the spinless btz for very large radius of curvature (i.e.,   0).
such a spacetime describes an expanding cylinder. as we now show, eq. (9) represents a
non-vacuum spacetime.

the corresponding matter distribution is given by the stress tensor components:

t0

0 = t1

1 = /(2r) + (r)/r ,

(10)

with all other components vanishing. the rst term arises from string-dust matter (see
below), whereas the second term indicates a point source at the center of symmetry.1

in the presence of , the eld equations are:

2
l2 gab
where  = l2 < 0. thus, eqs. (6) get modied to:
1 = r0

rab = 2gab  

r2

2 = 2/l2 , r1

,

0 .

(11)

(12)

with c = r2 (or, alternatively, ab = 1), these equations yield the spinless btz spacetime [2]
as the unique css solution. its metric is given by

ds2 = abtzdt2 + a1

btzdr2 + r2d2 ,

(13)

where abtz = r2/l2  m and m, an integration constant, is a conserved charge associ-
ated with asymptotic invariance under temporal displacements. when m > 0, it can be
interpreted as the black hole mass parameter. in such a case, the above spacetime is asymp-
totically anti-de sitter (ads). setting m = 1 gives the ads spacetime itself. the above
metric can also be generalized to include rotation [2].

under egt, eqs. (12) go over to

the above set is solved (for c = r2, r > 0) by:

g2

2 = 2/l2 , g1

1 = g0

0 .

a = 2r2/l2 + r +  = b1 .

(14)

(15)

similarly, if l2 < 0 in eqs. (12), then the solution to its dual set (eqs. (14) with l2 < 0) has
the line element:

ds2 = adt2 + a1dr2 + r2d2 ,

(16)
where a = r2/l2 + r + . we have dened l2 = l2/2. the matter distribution producing
the above metric is the same as that given by eqs. (10). in the above metric one can include
rotation to obtain a four-parameter family of black hole solutions:

ds2 = arot(r)dt2 + a1

rot(r)dr2 + r2(cid:18)d 

2

j

2r2 dt(cid:19)

,

(17)

1this is an interesting deviation from 4d gravity: it is well known that the schwarzschild spacetime
can not arise as a solution to a point source, unlike here in 3d. this dierence is again due to the
absence of gravitational interaction in 3d.

4

where arot = r2/l2 + r  m + j 2/(4r2) and j is the angular momentum. also, we set
 = m. we now explicitly show that the members of the subfamily with j = 0 have the
causal structure of a black hole.
the maximal extension of the above spacetime (with j = 0) can be achieved by trans-

forming to the analogue of the kruskal double-null coordinates,

u = 
1
v =
l

where r is the equivalent of the tortoise coordinate:

r =

l2l2 + 4m

ln(cid:20)

r  rh

r + rh + l2(cid:21) .

and

(18)

(19)

above, r = rh is the location of the horizon. it is related to the parameters of the solution
by,

in terms of the kruskal double-null coordinates, the metric takes the following form:

rh = l2( +q2 + 4m/l2)/2 .

ds2 =

 dudv + r2d2 ,

(20)

(21)

which is clearly non-singular at the horizon. the singularity itself lies at r = 0. this can be
inferred from the behavior of the ricci scalar, which is
r = 6/l2  2/r .

(22)

note that for  = 0, the metric is locally ads. however, for m  0, it describes a btz
black hole. for j = 0 and 1/l = 0, the metric (17) is the same as the dual-vacuum solution
(9), with  replaced by m. the causal structure of (9) can be easily recovered following
a similar analysis as above. for  > 0 and m > 0, it is a black hole with a horizon at
r = m/ that cloaks a spacelike singularity at r = 0.

the matter that yields the line element (17) corresponds to a cloud of strings [13],

apart from the point source at the center [14]. the associated stress tensor is:

t 
string = 

/()1/2 ,

(23)

where  is the proper energy density of the cloud,  is the 2d metric on a string world-
sheet, and  is the bivector associated with this world-sheet:  = ab x
x
b . here, ab
a
is the 2d levi-civita tensor (normalized such that 01 = 10 = 1) and a = (0, 1), where
0 and 1 are a timelike and a spacelike parameter on the string world-sheet. following
ref. [13] for 3d static css, it can be showen that the only non-zero components of the
string-dust stress tensor (23) are,

5

tstring 0

0 = tstring 1

1  r1 ,

(24)

which are associated with the dual solutions.

the matter stress tensor (10) corresponding to the dual-vacuum solution (9) contains a
couple of parameters,  and . matter with  > 0 and  < 0 is associated with a black hole.
by itself, the string-dust part of this matter stress tensor violates the null energy condition
(nec), whereas the point-source term obeys it at r = 0. for  < 0 and  > 0, one nds
a naked singularity at r = 0 and a horizon similar to a cosmological horizon in de sitter
space. however, even though the string-dust part of the matter stress tensor obeys nec
here, the point-source term violates it, in conformity with cosmic censorship. for both 
and  positive, the spacetime contains a naked singularity, but no horizon. also, the nec
is violated everywhere in this case.

the non-static css (17) can also be produced with a string-dust distribution. here,
however, not only 01, but also 12 is non-zero. the corresponding stress tensor can be
cast in the form given in eq. (24), with the indices now referring to the orthonormal triads
rather than the curvature coordinates.

we now discuss some mechanical and thermodynamical aspects of the solution in eq.
(17). in keeping with btz, we choose the ground state of this solution to have the same
metric, but with m = 0 and j = 0. then, m and j are just the noether charges associated
with asymptotic invariance under killing time-displacements and rotations. they are the
mass and angular momentum of the hole, respectively. indeed, they can be identied with the
brown and york (by) quasilocal mass and angular momentum as well, when the quasilocal
surface is taken at innity [1618] and the reference spacetime is taken to be the ground
state.

the entropy of a stationary black hole in einstein gravity depends only on the horizon
geometry. in 3d it is twice the horizon circumference independent of the asymptotic behavior
of gravitational elds and the presence of matter elds [2,17]. thus, the entropy of our
solution (17), with j = 0, is 4rh. also, for such a hole the surface r = rh is a killing
horizon. the killing vector normal to this surface is  = v. thus the surface gravity, ,

is given by 2 = abab/2. at the horizon, h = q2 + 4m/l2/2. (interestingly, for

metric (9)  = /2 everywhere and, thus, is an m-independent constant in space and time.)
for a canonical ensemble of such black holes, the thermodynamic internal energy can be
identied with the by quasilocal energy inside a circular box of curvature radius r = r:

e = 2(cid:20)qr2/l2 + r  m qr2/l2 + r(cid:21) .

then the temperature on the box is

t (r) =  e

s! =

1

4vuut

2 + 4m/l2

r2/l2 + r  m

=

h

2n(r)

,

(25)

(26)

where the lapse n(r) causes the temperature to redshift with distance. the last expression
has exactly the same form as that for a btz black hole [17].

we now consider the case of self-duality for egt, i.e., rab  gab. the self-dual
solutions obey rab = gab, which implies r = 0. however, rab need not be zero everywhere,

6

otherwise it would imply a vacuum solution. a particular class of self-dual solutions, which
obey n = r0

1 = 0, is:

0  r1

ds2 = asddt2 + a1

sd dr2 + r2d2 ,

(27)

where asd = 1c1+c2/r. this describes an asymptotically at spacetime with a decit angle
when c1 6= 0. for c1 = 0, we call this solution the 3d analogue of the schwarzschild, largely
due to its asymptotic atness and due to the fact that for c2 < 0, it is the equatorial section
of the schwarzschild solution. we are not aware of any solution in 3d with these features.
the causal structure of this metric is analogous to that of schwarzschild. the c1 6= 0 metric
itself describes the equatorial section of the barriola-vilenkin global monopole solution [19].

the matter stress tensor for the self-dual solution has the form (for c1 = 0) :

t0

0 = 

c2
2r3

;

t1

1 = 

c2
2r3

;

t2

2 =

c2
r3 .

(28)

the salient feature of this stress tensor is its tracelessness. it can be shown that massless,
non-minimally coupled scalar elds are a source with such a stress tensor [20]. on demanding
that it obeys nec, one gets a naked singularity. a violation of nec allows an eternal black
hole. however, regardless of whether c2 is negative or positive, the averaged null energy
condition (anec) along radial null geodesics is always satised. since solution (27) is
associated with a fundamental eld, it presents a promising arena for studying quantum
properties of gravity coupled to matter.

the above result on self-dual solutions can be easily extended to d > 3. for example,
in d = 4, on solving r = 0 (together with n = 0), one obtains the reissner-nordstrom
solution (which of course includes the schwarzschild solution as a special case). this solution
is again the equatorial section of the vacuum solution in one higher dimension, namely, 5d.
this appears to be a general property of spherically symmetric solutions to the equation
r = 0 for d  3.
our results demonstrate new classes of black hole spacetimes in 3d. they are related
via egt to known solutions. in fact, even without involving  or a non-trivial coupling
dependent on, say, a dilaton or a brans-dicke scalar eld, it is remarkable that 3d gravity
possesses a black hole, namely, the dual to at spacetime, eq. (9). this solution is associated
with string-dust matter. this is true about some dual solutions in 4d as well (see, e.g., ref.
[8]). thus, the association of string-dust with the metrics generated via egt appears to
be quite generic, even across spacetime dimensions. these distributions in 3d are, however,
distinguishable from those in 4d by their dierent (radial) fall-o behavior.

finally, it is possible to generalize our asymptotically non-at 3d solutions further by the
inclusion of circularly symmetric electromagnetic elds and/or other matter. also, issues
related to black hole thermodynamics as well as quantum gravity in the context of these
new geometries remain interesting problems to be explored.
