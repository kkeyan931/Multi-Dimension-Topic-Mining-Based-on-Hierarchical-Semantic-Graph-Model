abstract

model in zero dimension introduced in ref. 1), 2). it is argued that the model provides a
constructive approach to t ypei superstrings and is at the same time dynamical theory
of spacetime points. three subjects are discussed : semiclassical pictures and series of

degenerate perturbative vacua associated with the worldvolume representation of the
model, the formation of extended (d) objects from the fermionic integrations via the
(non-)abelian berry phase, and the schwinger-dyson/loop equations which exhibit the
joining-splitting interactions required.

introduction

1.

in this symposium, there are several talks devoted to the recent developments of the

large n limit of gauge theories and the matrix models for string unication. we will discuss
a specic matrix model in zero dimension based on usp(2k) introduced in ref. 1), 2). ( we
will refer to zero dimensional matrix model in general as reduced matrix model.) we will

present the criteria, the logic and the construction leading to the model as well as theoretical
implications from our present understanding.

gauge elds and strings - the two notions occupying our mind- have had interesting

relationship: which of the two notions is more fundamental has shifted from one to the
other over the decades. without making our talk historical, let us begin with mentioning
that our current practise is to construct string theory from noncommuting matrix degrees of

freedom which originated from gauge elds. the major goal is to overcome the diculties
of the rst quantized superstring theory which have prevented us from predicting physical

quantities: this will include the one associated with the existence of the innitely degenerate
perturbative vacua. let us rst recall the ve consistent perturbative superstrings in ten

dimensions constructed by the end of 1984.

type iib superstrings are related to type i superstrings by the twist operation and the
addition of the open-string sectors. the rest are related by the wilson lines and the t
duality in nine dimensions and by the s duality.

the reduced model of type iib superstrings has been proposed before 3). we will focus on
the reduced model which descends from the rst quantized nonorientable type i superstrings
4): they are related to heterotic strings by s duality. the usp(2k) matrix model thus has
a phenomenological perspective accessible to us by the presence of gauge bosons, matter
fermions and other properties.

the reduced model in general lays its basis on the correspondence with the covariant
in this sense, the applicability of the

green-schwarz superstrings in the schild gauge 5).
reduced model is by no means limited to low energy phenomena although its equivalence
with the rst quantized critical superstrings has so far been eatablished at the level of classical
equations of motion on the two-dimensional worldsheet. one dimensional matrix model 6)

2

of m theory 7) has, on the other hand, obtained successes on the agreement of the spectrum
and other properties with the low energy eleven-dimensional supergravity theory.

it has been demonstrated in 1), 2) that the usp(2k) matrix model is uniquely selected by

the three requirements:

requirements :

1)having eight dynamical and eight kinematical supercharges.
2)obtained by an appropriate projection from the iib matrix model and an addition of

the degrees of freedom corresponding to open strings.

3)nonorientable.

in the next section, we summarize the criteria and the logic leading to the model 2). we
will begin with presenting the closed string sector of the model. this will include introduction

of the usp projector and its commutativity with 8 + 8 supersymmetry. we also discuss the
reduced model- green-schwarz correspondence 3). after the discussion 8) on the open string
sector, the loop variables and the chan-paton symmetry, we will present the action of the

model in its nal form.

the reduced matrix model is a constructive approach to superstring theory.

it is at

the same time dynamical theory of spacetime points, which we briey discuss in the last
subsection. in quantum mechanics, space is a dynamical variable while time is considered to

be a parameter. in (relativistic) quantum eld theory, both space and time are parameters.
in reduced model, both space and time are dynamical variables appearing as eigenvalue

distributions. this is an ideal setup for pursuing quantum gravity which regards spacetime
as a derived concept.

in the subsequent sections, we discuss three subjects which are relevant to the properties

of the usp(2k) matrix model. leaving aside the issue of lifting the degenerate perturbative
vacua and the true scaling limit of the model, the matrix model permits us to consider

a series of such vacua with d objects through its t dualized worldvolume representation.
we will discuss 2) in section three a particular series of perturbative vacua associated with
the usp(2k) matrix model and the consistency of the model with the literature, examining
properties of 4d, 5d, 6d worldvolume eld theories. in section four, we study the model by
t -dualizing in the time direction, namely, by the t -dualized quantum mechanics. the main

purpose here is to reveal the existence of branes as quantized degrees of freedom which
the degrees of freedom in the fundamental representation are responsible for. this is done

by examining properties of the fermionic integrations via the (non)-abelian berry phase
9), 10). we nd formation of extended objects such as dirac monopoles and its nonabelian
generalization.

3

the complete consideration of the model can be established by the schwinger-dyson/loop
equations 8), which are considered to be the second quantized formulation of the reduced
matrix model. we present the derivation in the nal section. these loop equations exhibit
a complete set of the joining and splitting interactions required for the nonorientable t ypei

superstrings. the study at the linearized level provides us with the virasoro conditions
and the mixed dirichlet/neumann boundary conditions acting on the closed and open loop
variables.

we will make remarks not mentioned in the original papers along the way the discussion
goes. unless it is necessary, we will suppress the usp indices in most of our discussion. more
extensive references are found in the original papers 1), 2), 8) - 10).

2. criteria and logic leading to the model

2.1. projection from iib matrix model

we begin with the closed string sector. according to the criteria mentioned in the
introduction, this sector should be obtained from the action of the iib matrix model via
the appropriate projection which we will determine in the next subsection.

2.1.1. iib matrix model

the action of the iib matrix model is

siib(vm ,  ) =

2.1.2. covariant green-schwarz superstrings in the schild gauge

in the large k limit, one can check that this action siib(vm ,  ) goes to that of the
covariant green-schwarz superstrings in the schild gauge. let us sketch how this is seen.
in the large k limit, the group su() goes to the group of area preserving dieomorphisms
(ap d) on, for example, torus. ( we ignore the issue of the worldsheet geometry to consider
and other subtleties here.) the generators are represented by two index objects l ~m, ~m =
(m1, m2)t with m1, m2 being integers. the algebra reads

the vm are expanded in l ~m and can be written as

[l ~m, l~n] = (m1n2  m2n1) l ~m+~n .

2.1.3. usp/so projector

in order to make the closed string sector nonorientable, we need a projection of u(2k)
lie algebra valued matrices, which corresponds to the twist operation  on the worldsheet.

natural structure to consider is an embedding of usp and so lie algebras into the u(2k) lie
algebra. in both cases, it is expedient to introduce the following projector:

using this projector, one can uniquely decompose u(2k) lie algebra valued matrices into the

 

1

2 (cid:16)  f 1 t f(cid:17)

(2.14)

adjoint(= symmetric) and the antisymmetric representations of the usp lie algebra or into
the adjoint(= antisymmetic) and symmetric representations of the so lie algebra. this is

schematically drawn as

we have found out in references 2), 8) that the analysis based on the planar diagrams, the
consistency with the worldvolume eld theory and the chan-paton factor of the open loop

variable all lead to the choice of the usp case. in this talk we will only include this third
discussion in subsection 2.3.

let l ~m be a generator belonging to the antisymmetric representation of usp. in this

case, lt

~m = l ~mt with ~mt  (m1, m2). we nd
m = z d2

f 1vm f = vt

(2)2 vm (1, 2) l (~) .

(2.15)

the matrix f is in fact the matrix counterpart of the twist operation . if l ~m be a generator
belonging to the symmetric(=adjoint) representation of usp, we obtain an extra minus sign
to eq. (2.15), telling us an orientifold operation.

2.1.4. reduced model of closed nonorientable superstrings

to summarize, the closed string sector of the reduced matrix model descending from the

type i superstrings must take the following form:

sclose  s0(vm, i, , i , i, , i ) = siib(bvm , f  ) .

(2.16)

6

here b is a diagonal matrix acting on the vector indices while f  is a diagonal matrix
acting on the spinor indices. each entry of these two matrices is either  or +. how these
are chosen while preserving 8 + 8 supersymmetry is the subject of the next subsection.

2.2. usp projector and supersymmetry

in order to make 8 + 8 supersymmetry and the usp projector compatible, the model
must implement a set of conditions under which the projectors b, f , and dynamical (1)
as well as kinematical (2) supersymmetry commute. this constraint of commutativity turns
out to be very stringent and essentially leads to the unique possibility. we will repeat the
discussion of 2). start with

let us write generically

(1)vm = im

(2)vm = 0
(2) = 

[vm , vn ]  m n

m (n )
vm   n

the condition hb, (1)i vm = 0 together with eq. (2.17) gives
b (cid:17)  a = 0 ,

(m )a(cid:16)(a)

f   (m )

xa=1

with index m not summed. the condition

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.22)

(2.23)

hf , (1)i (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vm bvm
f (cid:17)h(m )

b vm , (n )

b vni(cid:16) m n (cid:17)a

= 0 .

(2.24)

together with eq. (2.18) provides

(cid:16)1  (a)

the restriction at eq. (2.23) comes from the fact that eq. (2.18) is true only on shell. eq.

(2.19) does not give us anything new while hf , (2)i  = 0 with eq. (2.20) gives

a1 = a (a)

f  1 ,

(2.25)

with index a not summed.

7

in order to proceed further, we rewrite eq. (2.21) explicitly as

(m )
b  (m  m) + (m  m+)+
(a)
f   (a  a) + (a  a+)+ ,

where

m  m+ = {{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }} , m  m+ =  ,

(2.26)

(2.27)

aa+ = {{ 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 19, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32 }} , aa+ =  . (2.28)
we nd that eq. (2.22) gives

while eq. (2.24) gives

equation (2.25) gives

(cid:16)m(cid:17)a+

= (cid:16)m+(cid:17)a

= 0 ,

(cid:16) mn+(cid:17)a
(cid:16) mn(cid:17)a+

= 0

= (cid:16) m+n+(cid:17)a+

= 0 .

a = 0 .

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

as we consider the case of eight kinematical supersymmetries, the number of elements of
the sets denoted by (a) must be

(a) = 8 and (a+) = 8 .

(2.32)

eqs. (2.29) and (2.30) are regarded as the ones which determine the anticommuting
parameter , and the sets a+, a, m+ and m. in addition they must satisfy the conditions
(2.27), (2.28) and (2.32).

we search for solutions by rst trying out as an input an appropriate thirty-two compo-
nent anticommuting parameter  satisfying majorana-weyl condition. given , we see if we
can determine a+, a, m+ and m successfully.

we have tried out many cases. the case leading to our model is

 = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)t

.

(2.33)

note that 0, 1, 0 and 1 are two-component anticommuting parameters.

this is the case considered in ref. 11), 12) in the context of m theory compactication to the
lightcone heterotic strings. the spinorial parameters 0, 1, 2 and 3 in eq. (2.35) are all
real, however, and the closed string sector obtained from this choice is not regarded as a
projection from the iib matrix model.

2.3. closed and open loops and chan-paton symmetry

loop variables play a decisive role in the second quantized formulation of the theory;

they eventually act as string elds. this will be discussed in section 5. we include the
part of the discussion here to appreciate the role played by the degrees of freedom in the

(anti-)fundamental representation and the attendant chan-paton symmetry.

9

2.3.1. adding fundamentals and avor symmetry

it is well known that nonorientable closed strings by themselves are not consistent. we

need to add degrees of freedom corresponding to open strings, keeping 8 + 8 susy. let
us, therefore, consider the following hypermultiplet in the fundamental/antifundamental

representation of usp(2k):

(cid:16)qi, qi, qi, i

q(cid:17) .

(2.39)

the number of this multiplet is denoted as nf .

to make this avoursymmetry (= local gauge symmetry of strings) manifest, let us

introduce complex 2nf dimensional vectors

q  


similarly,

,

q(f )
f 1 q(f nf )

,

f = 1  nf
f = nf + 1  2nf ,

q

(2.40)
f = nf + 1  2nf .

f = nf + 1  2nf ,

 q(f nf )

f ,

f = 1  nf
(2.41)
f = nf + 1  2nf .

  


q  


we denote the f -th components of these vectors by q(f ) etc.

2.3.2. choice of variables

let us rst introduce a discretized path-ordered exponential which represents a congu-

ration of a string in momentum superspace:

u[pm
.

, .; n1, n0]  p exp(i

n1

xn=n0

(pm

n vm + n )) =


n1

yn=n0

exp(ipm

n vm  in ) ,

n and n are respectively the sources or the momentum distributions for vm and

where pm
those for  . the closed loop is then dened by

[pm
.

, .; n1, n0]  t ru[pm

.

, .; n1, n0]

.

(2.42)

to consider an open loop, let us introduce  = (, ) as bosonic sources for q(f ) and q
and  = (cid:16), (cid:17) as grassmannian ones for q(f ) and q
(f ): (cid:16)(f )(cid:17) = q(f ) + f 1q
(cid:16) (f )(cid:17) = q(f ) + f 1 q


(f ). we write these collectively as



(f ),
(f ),

(cid:16) (f )(cid:17)  (cid:16)(f )(cid:17) +(cid:16) (f )(cid:17) .

the open loop is dened by

(2.44)

where f and f  are the chan-paton indices. the open and closed loops generate all of the
observables in the theory under question.

we now turn to the question of the nonorientability of the closed and the open loops.

using vt

m = f vm f 1,  t = f  f 1, and f t = f , we readily obtain

these equations relate a string conguration to the one with its orientation and the chan-

paton factor reversed and drawn pictorially as

the minus signs in front of pm

. and . in eq. (2.45) and eq. (2.46) reect the

orientifold structure of the usp(2k) matrix model.

the overall minus sign in the last line of (2.46) is of interst: it comes from f t = f of
the usp lie algebra and implies the so(2nf ) gauge group. this is the cleanest one of the
three rationales for the choice of the usp lie algebra: we present this as a table.

11

in order to inherit the infrared stability of perturbative vacua 13), 14) of superstrings, the
model must be based on the usp as opposed to the so lie algebra and nf = 16. this latter
property also follows from the anomaly cancellation of the 6d worldvolume gauge theory 2),
which we will discuss in subsection 3.2.

2.4.1.

the action of the usp matrix model

we nally come to the action of our usp(2k) reduced matrix model. it is obtained from
the dimensional reduction of n = 2, d = 4 usp(2k) supersymmetric gauge theory with one
hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric representation and nf hypermultiplets in the fundamen-
tal representation. this makes manifest the presence of the eight dynamical supercharges.
in the n = 1 supereld notation with spacetime dependence all dropped, we have a vector
supereld v and a chiral supereld   1 which are usp lie algebra valued
0 
i
 , (2.47)

v t = f v f 1 , t = f f 1 , v  = v , with f =

and the two chiral superelds i, i = 2, 3 in the antisymmetric representation which obey

i = f if 1
t

for i = 2, 3 .

(2.48)

we can write v = v , 1 = 1, i = +i, i = 2, 3. the total action is written as

2.5. notion of spacetime points

we have seen the validity and the rationales of the usp(2k) reduced matrix model as a

constructive model descending from type i superstrings. as we will see, the model is also
dynamical theory of spacetime points.. as is mentioned at the introduction, the dynamical
degrees of freedom of spacetime points x (i)

m are embedded in the matrices. we write

vm = xm + vm ,

(2.65)

where vm are o-diagonal matrices. one can imagine integrating out the bosonic o-
diagonals and the fermions. this will give dynamics to the spacetime points. the object we
study is the eective action for the spacetime points 9), 10), 15), 16):

ln zhx (i)

mi .

(2.66)

it is sometimes instructive to study the case in which the spacetime points are assumed

to interact weakly and are widely separated.
in this case we can approximate the usp
matrices by individual su(2) blocks. we will nd below that this approximation has a

direct connection to string theory results obtained from the worldvolume gauge theories in
various dimensions.

3. matrix t dual and representation as worldvolume gauge theories

before going into the subject of this section, let us note that the classical solution of
the model which gives vanishing action is broken by z2 for six of the adjoint directions. in
fact, the commutator of   (1) + (2) with itself closes into translation only for four of the
antisymmetric matrices as is clear from eq. (2.31). this in fact means the presence of the
o3 xed surfaces. the discussions in later sections convince ourselves of the presence of d3

branes as well in the original representation. these appear in such a way that the total rr
ux of the system cancels 17).

3.1. general remarks and the series of degenerate vacua associated with the model

what we would like to put forward with the reduced matrix model is a constructive

approach to unied string theory. we presume that the lifting of perturbative vacua requires

14

genuinely nonperturbative mechanism and this can only be accomplished by nding the
proper scaling limit of the model, which is a dicult task at this moment.

as a separate theme of research, we try to establish the consistency of the usp matrix
model with string perturbation theory in the presence of d-branes (semiclassical object) via

the worldvolume representation. in particular, one can think of toroidal compactications
in various dimensions via the recipe of 18). while some nonperturbative eects can be seen
as exact results on worldvolume gauge theories, this representation leaves aside the original
goal of lifting perturbative string vacua. in fact, one naively sets k   and has no hope
of capturing the true vacuum.

the procedure of matrix toroidal compactication is well known and will not be reviewed
instead, we just tabulate the relevant properties and the correspondence with the

here.

classical counterparts. we have seen in the last section that f is a matrix counterpart
of the twist operation . the matrix t dual is nothing but a fourier transform t . we
can consider the combined transformation of these. we have observed in 2) that the sign ip
occurs provided the worldvolume gauge elds are odd under parity. these are summarized

as a table.

from matrix toroidal compactication, we nd a series of degenerate perturbative vacua

associated with the usp(2k) matrix model. in the remainder of this section, we will see the
consistency of the worldvolume representation of the usp matrix model in various dimensions

with some literature. when some of the adjoint directions get compactied and become
small, it is preferrable to t-dualize the system into these diretions. one can imagine this as
a gure:

3.2. 6d,5d,4d worldvolume representations

we now look at the t dualized form of the usp matrix model for the cases of the
6d, 5d, 4d worldvolume theories, which respectively represent typei theory in ten dimensions,
its orientifold compactication on s1/z 2 (9d string theory) and that on t 2/z 2 (8d string
theory). we will demand that all of the degenerate perturbative vacua discussed above be
infrared stable. we will nd out nf = 16 and in each case we distribute these evenly around

anomaly cancellation

nf = 61

for consistency, we have added the elds lying in the fundamental representation. they
are responsible for creating an open string sector.
in string perturbation theory, the in-
frared stability is seen through the (global) cancellation of dilaton tadpoles between disk
and rp 2 diagrams 13), 14), leading to the so(32) chan-paton factor. this survives toroidal
compactications with/without discrete projection 19).

we have found out that in the case of all six adjoint directions compactied, the infrared
stability gets translated into the consistency of the six dimensional worldvolume usp(2k)

gauge theory with matter in the antisymmetric and fundamental representations. in fact,
by acting

on  , we see that the adjoint fermions  and 1 have chirality plus while 2,3 have chirality

(6)   0 1 2 3 4 7

(3.1)

16

minus. the fermions in the fundamental representation have chirality minus. the standard
technology to compute nonabelian anomalies is provided by familys index theorem and the

descent equations. we nd that the condition for the anomaly cancellation:

tradjf 4  trasymf 4  nf trf 4
= (2k + 8)trf 4 + 3(cid:16)trf 2(cid:17)2
= (16  nf ) trf 4 = 0 ,

(cid:18)(2k  8) trf 4 + 3(cid:16)trf 2(cid:17)2(cid:19)  nf trf 4

(3.2)

where we have indicated the traces in the respective representations. the case nf = 16 is
selected by the consistency of the theory. in the case discussed in eq. (2.38), we conclude
from similar calculation that the anomaly cancellation of the worldvolume two-dimensional

gauge theory selects sixteen complex fermions.

this result is reasonable from the classical consideration of the rr ux. we know
that the ux is from o3 to nf of d3 and their mirror and is in the adjoint directions. when
all of the six adjoint directions are compactied, the ux cannot escape to innity and the
total ux had better vanish. in this way, we also get nf = 16. although we will not discuss
here, a version of anomaly inow argument is operating which relates the conservation of

the rr ux to the nonabelian anomaly.

3.2.2. space-dependent (axion-) dilaton background eld

the simplest quantity to be computed in the worldvolume representation of matrix mod-
els in general is the eective running coupling constant g2
ef f (u) obtained from the low-energy
eective action. here ~u is a vev of the scalars which labels quantum moduli space. the
g2
ef f (~u) represents the marginal scalar deformation of the original action to a type of nonlin-
ear  model. the background eld appearing through this procedure is a massless (axion-
)dilaton eld. the running coupling constant is identied as the space-dependent (axion-)
dilaton background eld. one strategy to compute g2
ef f (u) is i) to begin with comput-
ing the part of the eective action associated with the fermionic integrations, ii) to invoke
supersymmetry to nd out sef f , and iii) to take the hessian of sef f to obtain g2

ef f (u).

3.2.3. 5d

let us rst consider the widely separated case, namely, su(2) case with eight avours per
xed surface. x7 = u and x5,6,8,9 decouple. omitting the derivation, we write the result 20)

(see also 21).) the usp(2k) matrix model provides a natural generalization to this. the
answer this time depends on the k spacetime points x (i)
7 and on those of the antisymmetric
directions x (i)
5,6,8,9. we have completed the rst step of the computation 22) and the answer
appears to reect that the spacetime is curved in the x (i)

5,6,8,9 directions.

3.2.4. 4d

it has been shown that the model is able to describe 1), 2) the f theory compactication on
an elliptic bered k3 23), 24). we will not repeat the discussion here. in the widely separated
case (su(2) with four avours and u = x4 + ix7 ), the 4d worldvolume theory obtaind is
exactly sens scaling limit to f on k3 24). the space-dependent axion/dilaton background
eld is controlled by the seiberg-witten curve. the model again provides an interesting

generalization to the usp(2k) case and much remains to be worked out.

4. formation of extended objects from (non)-abelian berry phase

we now show that the model contains degrees of freedom corresponding to d-objects.

we study the eective action for the spacetime points. in particular, we study the eects
of fermionic integrations which contain the information of the rr sector to deduce the

coupling of d-objects to spacetime. this will be the eect which survives the cancellation
of the bosonic integrations against the fermionic ones. we will suppress here the nature of

time in the reduced model as dynamical variable in order to form a loop in the parameter
space (= spacetime points.) we will study the coupling in the representation of the model
as t dualized quantum mechanics via the berry phase.

4.1. path-dependent eective action

we will make the eective action dependent on the paths { (r)

labelled by the ve sets of the adjoint spacetime points x = diag(x (1)

also let y  (y 4, y 7, y 1)t. the y coordinates parametrize the su(2) group element as
well:

t  y 212 + iy   ,
from which we can make the pure gauge conguration

dt t 1 = (dy 212 + idy  )(y 212  iy  )
= i(dy  y + y 2dy  ydy 2)  .

the nal answer we have found out is

a (x ) = p(r, x 3)dt t 1 .
the prefactor p(r, x 3) is of interest and can be written as

the nonabelian connection a is in fact the bpst instanton conguration. the size of the
instanton  is not a bonade parameter of the model but is chosen to be the fth coordinate
in the ve dimensional euclidean space. for xed , the four dimensional subspace embed-
ded into the r5 is a paraboloid wrapping the singularity. an observer on this recognizes
the pointlike singularity as the bpst instanton. as  goes to zero, this paraboloid gets
degenerated into an su(2) counterpart of the dirac string connecting the origin and the

innity. note also that the prefactor is written in terms of the angle measured from the
north pole as

let us exploit the symmetry of the roots and the weights under e(i)  e(i). in general,
neither the second line nor the third one collapse to unity. observe that, due to this symme-
try, we can pair the two-dimensional vector space associated with ra (or wa
asym) and that
with ra (or wa
asym). let us symmetrize the tensor product of these two two-dimensional
vector spaces. on this, the nonabelian berry phase is reduced to the pure gauge conguration

in order to understand better the formation of the bpst instanton obtained from the non-

abelian berry phase, we will study this problem ignoring the degeneracy i.e. in the abelian

let us give this conguration we have obtained a brane interpretation rst from the six
dimensional and subsequently from the ten dimensional point of view. it should be noted
that the two coordinates which the connection a(berry) does not depend on are the angular
cooordinates 1, 1, so that x1, x2 are not quite separable from the rest of the coordinates
x3, x4, x7 in eq. (4.32). only in the asymptotic region | x

3 |2 transverse to the three dimensional space where the berry phase is obtained. in
size  | x 
this region, the magnetic ux obtained from the b(= 1)-form connection embedded in d(= 6)-
dimensional spacetime looks approximately as is discussed in 25): the ux no longer looks
coming from a poinlike object but from a d b 3(= 2) dimensionally extended object. the
magnetic monopole obeying the dirac quantization behaves approximately like a d2 brane
extending to the (1,2) directions, which are perpendicular to the orientifold surface. in fact,

the presence of this object and its quantized magnetic ux have been detected by quantum
mechanics of a point particle (electric d0 brane) obtained from the n = 1 and n = 3 particle
states of the fermionic sector in the fundamental representation. the induced interaction

is a minimal one. we conclude that the d0 represented by the rst and the third excited
states of the quantum mechanical problem given above is under the magnetic eld created
by d2. to include the four remaining coordinates (x5, x6, x8, x9) of the antisymmetric
directions, we appeal to the translational invariance which is preserved in these directions.

the simplest possibility is that they appear in the coupling through the derivatives

z a(berry) = z yi=5,6,8,9

dx idx a5689 .

(4.33)

with this assumption, the d0 brane is actually a d4 bane extended in (5, 6, 8, 9) directions
while the d2 still occupies (1, 2): the quantization condition is preserved in ten dimensions

as well.

the term x[(1); x r] comes from the variation of the action and contains terms representing
closed-open transition. for its explicit form, see the original paper 8). we present the pictures

we have checked that all three of the loop equations are expressed by the closed and open

loops  and  and their derivatives with respect to the sources introduced. for example,
1 + 1]q contained in (x[(1); x r]) in eq. (5.7)
the expression q
is represented as

in this sense, the set of loop equations we have derived is closed. it is noteworthy that all
of the terms in the above loop equations are either an innitesimal deformation of a loop or

a consequence from the two elementary local processes of loops which are illustrated in fig.
13.

it is interesting to discuss the system of loop equations we have derived in the light of
string eld theory. in addition to the lightcone superstring eld theory constructed earlier
in 26), there is now gauge invariant string eld theory for closed-open bosonic system 27).
we nd that the types of the interaction terms of our equations are in complete agree-
ment with the interaction vertices seen in 26) and the second paper of 27).
in particular,
figures 2  5, 7  9, 11  12 for the interactions of our equations are in accordance with
4 of 27). while brs invariance determines the coecients of the in-
u, v, v c
teraction vertices in 27), the (bare) coecients are already determined in our case from the
rst quantized action. this may give us insight into properties of the model which are not
revealed.

5.2. linearized loop equations and a free string

let us consider the all three loop equations eqs. (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) in the linearized
approximation, namely, ignoring the joining and splitting of the loops. let us rst introduce
a variable conjugate to pan or kan and that to n or n by

n = i

n = i

(5.14)

by acting x a
of  at point n on the loop.

n and n on a loop, we obtain respectively an operator insertion of va and that

29

now consider eq. (5.1) and eq. (5.2) for the case x r = vr

m , multiplying them by p(1)
nm
and k(1)
nm respectively. consistency requires that, for these terms, we must take into account
the term from the interactions which represents splitting of a loop with innitesimal length.
this in fact occurs when the splitting point n coincides with the point n(1)
1 at which t r is
inserted. we obtain

(5.16)

(5.17)

(5.18)

(5.19)

these equations lead to the half of the virasoro conditions 29):

0 = (p(1)2

n + x (1)2

n + (fermionic part))

h[(1)][(2)]   [(n)] [(1)]    [(l)]i ,

0 = (k(1)2

n + x (1)2

n + (fermionic part))

h[(1)][(2)]   [(n)] [(1)]    [(l)]i ,

where  implies taking a dierence between two adjacent points n and n+1. the reparametriza-
tion invariance of the wilson loops leads to the remaining half of the virasoro conditions:

0 = (p(1)m

n

x (1)

nm + (fermionic part))

h[(1)][(2)]   [(n)] [(1)]    [(l)]i ,

next, let us consider eq. (5.3), ignoring joining and splitting of the loops. again consis-
tency appears to require that we drop the cubic terms consisting of q and q in z  [(1); z]
. to write explicitly, the following expression must vanish

(5.24)

as we stated before, the lefthand sides of eqs. (5.22) and (5.23) are expressible as an
open loop with some functions of x a
acting on the loop. let us see by inspection
l(1)
1
how eqs. (5.22) and (5.23) are satised by the source functions alone. consider the following
conguration of xn and n , n = l(1)
1 :

and l(1)

1

x   0 for  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 ,
x i  0 for i = 5, 6, 8, 9
3     ,

x 4 = mf

.

(5.25)
(5.26)
(5.27)

where 3  5689. again these equations should be understood in the sense of an
insertion at the end point of the open loop.

eqs.

(5.25), (5.26), and (5.27) tell us that the open loop  [(1)] obeys the dirichlet
boundary conditions for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 directions and the neumann boundary conditions for

5, 6, 8, 9 directions.

we nd that the conguration given by eqs. (5.25), (5.26) and (5.27) solves the linearized
loop equations (5.22), (5.23). this conguration clearly tells us the existence of nf d3 branes
and their mirrors each of which is at a distance mf away from the orientifold surface in
the fourth direction. this conclusion consolidates both the semiclassical picture in section

three and the picture emerging from the fermionic integrations in section four.
