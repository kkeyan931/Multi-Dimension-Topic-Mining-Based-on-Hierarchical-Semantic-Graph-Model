abstract

closed type 0 string theories and their d-branes are introduced. the
full wess-zumino action of these d-branes is derived. the analogy with
type ii is emphasized throughout the argument.

type 0 strings and d-branes. type 0 string theory is a non-
supersymmetric, modular invariant theory of closed strings. the pres-
ence of a tachyonic state in their spectrum makes type 0 strings much
harder to analyse than the supersymmetric type ii strings. nevertheless,
type 0 and type ii strings have many features in common. in this con-
tribution this fact will be exploited to show that type 0 d-branes have
anomalous terms in their worldvolume action. the analysis is based on
ref. [1], to which we refer for a more detailed treatment and for a more
complete list of references.

in the neveu-schwarz-ramond formulation, type ii string theories are
obtained by imposing independent gso projections on the left and right
moving part. this amounts to keeping the following (left,right) sectors:

iib :
iia :

(ns+, ns+) ,
(ns+, ns+) ,

(r+, r+) ,
(r+, r) ,

(r+, ns+) ,
(r+, ns+) ,

(ns+, r+) ;
(ns+, r) ,

where for instance r is the ramond sector projected with pgso =
(1  ()f )/2, f being the world-sheet fermion number.

the type 0 string theories contain instead the following sectors:

0b :
0a :

(ns+, ns+) ,
(ns+, ns+) ,

(ns, ns) ,
(ns, ns) ,

(r+, r+) ,
(r+, r) ,

(r, r) ;
(r, r+) .

these theories do not contain bulk spacetime fermions, which would
have to come from mixed (r,ns) sectors. the inclusion of the ns-ns
sectors with odd fermion numbers means that the closed string tachyon
is not projected out. the third dierence with type ii theories is that
the r-r spectrum is doubled. for instance, in the 0b case, beside the
iib r-r potentials cp+1 contained in bispinors of the (r+,r+) sector,
there are the potentials c 
p+1 from bispinors of the (r,r) sector. note
that the bispinors containing the primed and unprimed r-r potentials
have opposite chirality. this implies a sign dierence in the poincare
duality relations among the eld strengths. thus, for instance, in type
0b there is an unconstrained ve-form eld strength, whose self-dual
(anti-self-dual) part is the unprimed (primed) eld strength.
for our purposes, convenient combinations of cp+1 and c 

p+1 are

(cp+1) =

1
2

(cp+1  c 

p+1) .

(1.1)

for p = 3 these are the electric (+) and magnetic () potentials [2]. we
will adopt this terminology also for other values of p. there turn out
to be four types of elementary d-branes for each p: an electric and
a magnetic one (i.e., charged under (cp+1)), and the corresponding
antibranes [2].

anomalous couplings. the open strings stretching between two like
branes are bosons, just like the bulk elds of type 0. however, a bound-
ary state computation shows that fermions appear from strings between
an electric and a magnetic brane [2]. thus one could wonder whether
there are chiral fermions on the intersection of an electric and a magnetic
brane. consider such an orthogonal intersection with no overall trans-
verse directions. if the dimension of the intersection is two or six, the
computation reveals that there are precisely enough fermionic degrees
of freedom on the intersection to form one chiral fermion.

in type ii string theory, the analogous computation shows that chi-
ral fermions are present on two or six dimensional intersections of two
orthogonal branes with no overall transverse directions. that observa-
tion has had far reaching consequences. namely, the presence of chiral
fermions has been shown to lead to gauge and gravitational anoma-
lies on those intersections of d-branes [3]. in a consistent theory, such

anomalies should be cancelled by anomaly inow. in the present case,
the anomaly inow is provided by the anomalous d-brane couplings in
the wess-zumino part of the d-brane action [3]. these anomalous cou-
plings have an anomalous variation localized on the intersections with
other branes.

to sketch how this anomaly inow comes about, let us focus on the
case of two type iib d5-branes (to be denoted by d5 and d5) inter-
secting on a string. the wess-zumino action on d5 contains a term of

the form rd5 c2  y4, where c2 is the r-r two-form potential and y4 a

certain four-form involving the eld strength of gauge eld on d5 and
the curvature two-forms of the tangent and normal bundles of d5. to be

precise, one should replace this term by rd5 h3  3, with y4 = d3 and

h3 the complete gauge-invariant eld strength of c2 (which generically
diers from dc2). since the gauge variation of the chern-simons form
3 is given by 3 = di2 for some two-form i2, the anomalous term on
d5 have a variation localized on the intersection with d5:

h3  3 = zd5

dh3  i2 = zd5

zd5

d  h7  i2 = zd5

d5  i2 , (1.2)
which can thus cancel the anomaly due to the chiral fermions living on
the intersection. a careful analysis of all the anomalies [3] shows that the
anomalous part of the dp-brane action is given, in terms of the formal
sum c of the various r-r forms, by

swz =

tp

 zp+1

c  e2 f +b  q a(rt )/ a(rn ) .

(1.3)

here tp/ denotes the dp-brane tension, f the gauge eld on the brane
and b the ns-ns two-form. further, rt and rn are the curvatures
of the tangent and normal bundles of the d-brane world-volume, and a
denotes the a-roof genus.

let us now return to type 0 string theory. as stated above, here chiral
fermions live on intersections of electric and magnetic type 0 d-branes.
the associated gauge and gravitational anomalies on such intersections
match the ones for type ii d-branes. to cancel them, the minimal cou-
pling of a dp-brane to a (p + 1)-form r-r potential should be extended
to the following wess-zumino action [1]:

swz =

tp

 zp+1

(c)  e2 f +b  q a(rt )/ a(rn ) .

(1.4)

the  in eq. (1.4) distinguishes between electric and magnetic branes.
note that tp/ denotes the tension of a type ii dp-brane, which can be
computed to be 2 times the type 0 dp-brane tension [2].

4

the argument that the variation of this action cancels the anomaly on
the intersection is a copy of the one described above in the type ii case,
apart from one slight subtlety. for deniteness, consider the intersection
of an electric and a magnetic d5-brane on a string. varying the elec-
tric d5-brane action (exhibiting the (c2)+ potential, or rather, its eld
strength (h3)+), one nds that the variation is localized on the inter-
section of the electric d5-brane with branes charged magnetically under
the (h3)+ eld strength. using eq. (1.1), the dierent behaviour under
poincare duality of the primed and unprimed r-r eld strengths shows
that these are precisely the branes carrying (electric) (h7) charge, i.e.
what we called the magnetic d5-branes. schematically,

zd5+

(h3)+3 = zd5+

d5i2 .
(1.5)
a completely analogous discussion goes through for the variation of the
magnetic d5-brane action.

d(h7)i2 = zd5+

d(h3)+i2 = zd5+
