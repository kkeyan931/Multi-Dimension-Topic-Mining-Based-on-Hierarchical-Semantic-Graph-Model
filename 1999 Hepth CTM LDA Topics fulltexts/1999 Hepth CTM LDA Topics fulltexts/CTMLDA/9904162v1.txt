abstract

the characteristic features of hti in the boulware, unruh and hartle-hawking states
for a conformal massless scalar eld propagating in the schwarzschild space-time are
obtained by means of eective actions deduced by the trace anomaly. the actions
are made local by the introduction of auxiliary elds and boundary conditions are
carefully imposed on them in order to select the dierent quantum states.

1 introduction

one of the most interesting aspects of quantum matter elds propagating in curved
space-time [1] is the existence of a trace anomaly discovered by capper and du [2]
in 1974 and its deep connection with hawkings black hole evaporation [3], [4], [5] .
at the classical level if the action describing the matter elds is conformally invariant
the trace t of the corresponding stress energy tensor vanishes. however, when the
elds are quantized as a result of the renormalization procedure the expectation value
of the trace hti diers from zero when space-time dimension is even. we then have
an anomaly. this anomaly depends on geometrical quantities only: it is expressed
in terms of the riemann tensor of the space-time and its contractions. furthemore
being an ultraviolet eect, the anomaly is general in the sense that its value does
not depend on the quantum state in which the expectation value is taken. in four
dimensions (4d) we have

ht 

 i  hti = 

1
(4)2 (ac 2 + be + cr)

(1.1)

where c 2  cc  is the square of the weyl tensor and e is an integrand of the
gauss-bonnet topological term

e  rr  4rr + r2

(1.2)

and a, b, c are known numerical coecients that depend on the spin of the matter
elds considered [1].
in 2d we have the much simpler form

ht 

 i  hti = gr
where as before g depends on the matter species.
the knowledge of the trace anomaly allows some information on the complete quan-
tum stress tensor expectation values hti to be extracted.
in 2d the conservation equations aht b
a i = 0 and the trace anomaly, eq. (1.3), de-
termine almost completely the stress tensor. parametrizing the 2d spacetime metric

(1.4)

(1.5)

where t(x) are arbitrary functions of their arguments which depend on the choice
of quantum state in which the expectation values are taken. they represent conserved

1

radiation which, being traceless, cannot be determined by the trace anomaly alone.
these functions are xed by boundary conditions. the above expressions for htabi can
also be obtained by rigorous canonical quantization and point splitting regularization
of the divergences [7].
in 4d the situation is much more fuzzy since the four conservations equations and
the trace anomaly eq. (1.1) are clearly insucient to determine the ten components
of hti. things improve if the background space-time on which the quantum matter
elds propagate enjoys some symmetries which reduce the number of independent
components of hti [5].
unfortunately in 4d it appears impossible (at least for the moment) to nd a nice
formula analogous to eqs. (1.5) giving hti as a function of a general metric g. such
an expression would allow us the study of the evolution of the background geometry
driven by the quantum uctuation of the matter elds propagating on it. this is the
so called backreaction, governed by the semiclassical einstein equations

g(g) = 8ht(g)i ,

(1.6)

where g is the einsteins tensor.
in principle ht(g)i can be derived from an eective action sef f (g) describing
the quantum matter elds propagating on g. although sef f (g) is unknown, the
trace anomaly hti can be used to reconstruct at least a part of it, i.e. the so called
anomaly induced eective action. san

ef f (g) is then dened as following

g

san
ef f
g

g

= hti .

by functional integration of this equation one obtains the explicit form of san
the complete eective action sef f (g) can then be written as

ef f .

sef f (g) = san

ef f (g) + sw (g) ,

(1.7)

(1.8)

where sw is a conformal invariant functional which can be regarded as an integration
constant of eq. (1.7). as expected, the exact form of sw is not known.
taking the functional derivation of san
induced stress tensor s as follows

ef f (g) with respect to g we dene the anomaly

san
ef f
g

g

= hsi

(1.9)

where of course hsi = hti. it is tempting, given our ignorance on hti, to use hsi in
the semiclassical einstein equations (1.6) to get at least a feeling on the backreaction
problem.
the basic question is: how close hsi is to hti? in other words, can we ignore
the weyl invariant part sw to get correctly at least the qualitative features of the
backreaction? it is hard to nd answers to the above questions since we do not know

2

in general ht(g)i . however, for some particular background, say g, ht(g)i
is known and hence a check of the above conjecture can be given by direct comparison
of ht(g)i and the corresponding hs(g)i.
the background g we have in mind is the schwarzschild black hole geometry

ds2 = (1  2m/r)dt2 + (1  2m/r)1dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2)

or

where

ds2 = (1  2m/r)dudv + r2d2 ,

u = t  r  2m ln|r/2m  1|,
v = t + r + 2m ln|r/2m  1|

(1.10)

(1.11)

(1.12)

and d2 is the metric for the unit two-sphere. this, because of its physical implication,
most notably hawking black hole evaporation, is one of the most studied space-time
in quantum eld theory in curved space.
detailed analytical and numerical investigations , by means of modes sum and point-
splitting regularization or by axiomatic principles, of hti in this background have
been performed [8]. we are rather condent on these results on which, we stress, our
understanding of all quantum black hole physics is based.
in the schwarzschild space-time three dierent quantum states (vacua) are dened
by expanding eld operators in suitable basis:

i) the boulware vacuum |bi [9].
this is obtained by choosing in and out modes to be positive frequency with respect
to the killing vector t of the metric (1.10). this state most closely reproduces the
familiar notion of minkowski vacuum |mi asymptotically. one nds, as r  ,
hb|t|bi  0 suciently rapidly, i.e. o(r6). unfortunately, the behaviour on
the horizon r = 2m is rather pathological, being hb|t|bi divergent there in a free
falling frame.
this state is appropriate for the description of vacuum polarization around a static
star whose radius is necessary bigger than the horizon.

ii) the unruh vacuum |ui [10].
in modes are chosen as before to be positive frequency with respect to t. this en-
sures that asymptotically in the past |ui  |mi. on the other hand, out modes are
taken to be positive frequency with respect to kruskals u = 4meu/4m , the ane
parameter along the past horizon. this mimics the late time behaviour of modes
coming out of a collapsing star as its surface approaches the horizon. by this choice
hu|t|ui is regular on the future (but not on the past) event horizon and most re-
markably asymptotically in the future hu|t|ui has the form of a ux of radiation
at the hawking temperature th = 1
this state is the most appropriate to discuss evaporation of black holes formed by

8m .

3

gravitational collapse of matter. in that case the divergence on the past horizon is
spurious.

iii) the israel-hartle-hawking state |hi [11].
this state is obtained by choosing in modes to be positive frequency with respect to
kruskals v = 4mev/4m , the ane parameter on the future horizon, whereas outgoing
modes are positive frequency with respect to u. by this choice asymptotically both
in the future and the past |hi 6= |mi.
hh|t|hi for r   describes in fact a thermal bath of radiation at the hawking
temperature th. by construction this state is regular on both the future and the past
horizon. |hi is used to describe a black hole in thermal equilibrium with a surround-
ing bath.

we summarize here, for later comparison, the analytic expression of the stress tensor
for a conformally invariant scalar eld in the three vacua dened above.
in 2d schwarzschild spacetime (neglect the angular part in eq. (1.11) ) we have [12]

in this paper, starting from the trace anomaly, we shall consider san
ef f for a mass-
less scalar eld propagating in the schwarzschild space-time. from this, by functional
derivation, we obtain the corresponding stress tensor hsi which should then be
compared with the expected results of hti given by eqs. (1.13)-(1.20).

2 polyakovs action

as a warm up exercise we start with the 2d schwarzschild space-time and a conformal
massless scalar eld propagating on it. the purpose of it is purely pedagogical. the
results will not be new, although their nonstandard derivation is new and illustrates
in a simple way our strategy, the computational techniques and the basic physical
ingredients we shall use to deal the most interesting 4d case (see next section).
the classical action for the massless eld f reads

s = z d2xqg(2)f f ,

5

(2.1)

where g(2) is the determinant of the 2d schwarzschild metric (see eqs. (1.10) and
(1.11) with angular part omitted). by canonical quantization and renormalization
the corresponding htabi can be computed in the three vacua and the results are given
in eqs. (1.13)-(1.15).
our procedure starts with the expression of the trace anomaly, which in arbitrary 2d
spacetime reads [4]

hti = (24)1r .

(2.2)

the anomaly induced eective action is obtained by functional integration of this
anomaly (see eq. (1.7) ). it is the well known polyakov action [15]

san
ef f = sp =

(2.3)

where  is the dalembertian.
this action is nonlocal, but it can be made local either by choosing a conformal gauge
or by introducing an auxiliary eld  (and keeping the gauge arbitrary). we can write

sp = 
the equation of motion for  is

1

96 z d2xg ( + 2r) .

 = r .

(2.4)

(2.5)

once this is substituted back in eq. (2.4) we reobtain the nonlocal form of eq. (2.3).
the anomaly induced stress tensor hsabi is dened as

(2.6)

(2.5) for the auxiliary eld  by assuming the 2d
(2.6) to nd

our strategy is to solve eq.
schwarzschild spacetime as background, substitute the result in eqs.
hsabi and compare with eqs. (1.13)-(1.15).
before we start the program we have to solve a basic problem, how to implement
state dependence in our hsabi. being hti state independent, san
ef f makes no apparent
reference to a particular quantum state.
note however that eq. (2.5) determines the solution for  modulo arbitrary solution
of the homogeneous equation  = 0. it is through the choice of the homogeneous
solution that the state dependence will be encoded in our framework. the homoge-
neous solution will be chosen by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on  that
reect the physical features of the states |bi, |ui and |hi.
since by eq. (2.5) we have

 =

r ,

(2.7)

1


by this procedure we impose boundary conditions on the operator 1/ characterizing
the particular quantum state we are working with.
for the 2d schwarzschild spacetime eq. (2.5) becomes

a[a] =

4m
r3

,

6

(2.8)

whose general solution we can write as

 = at  ln(1  2m/r) + a [r + 2m ln(r  2m)] + b

with


r

= (1  2m/r)1(

2m
r2 + a) ,

(2.9)

(2.10)

where a, a and b are arbitrary constants which once xed determine the solution of
the homogeneous equation.
the choice of a linear dependence in t is simple. given the structure of hsabi in terms
of  (see eq. (2.6) ), it is clear that any t dependence dierent from the linear would
imply thsabi 6= 0 , which contradicts the exact result thtabi = 0. the presence of
such a linear term allows, as we shall see, that hsrti 6= 0 which is indeed needed in
the unruh state.
inserting the solution for  in eq. (2.6) we obtain

(2.11)

now we have to x the arbitrary constants according to our choice of quantum state.

i) boulware vacuum |bi.
this state by construction reduces as r   to minkowski vacuum and there
hb|tab|bi should vanish. it is clear from the above equations that in order to fullll
the asymptotic requirement we have to impose a = a = 0 and we nd

hb|stt|bi =

hb|srr|bi = 
hb|srt|bi = 0 .

48

2m 2
r4 (1  2m/r)2 ,

we see the exact agreement of our hb|sab|bi with eqs. (1.13), namely

hb|sab|bi = hb|tab|bi .

with the above choice of integration constants the auxiliary eld  becomes

 =  ln(1  2m/r) + b

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

which vanishes for r   if we further set b = 0. note the singularity of  for
r = 2m which causes the divergence of hb|sab|bi on the horizon.

7

ii) unruh state |ui.
by assumption there is no incoming ux (i.e. hu|svv|ui = 0 as r  ) and hu|sab|ui
has to be regular on the future horizon (i.e. hu|suu|ui  0 at least as (r  2m)2,
hu|svv|ui  reg. and hu|suv|ui  (r2m) for r  2m ). the asymptotic condition
4 (cid:16)hu|stt|ui + (1  2m/r)2hu|srr|ui + 2(1  2m/r)hu|srt|ui(cid:17)  0
hu|svv|ui =
(2.15)
requires a = a. furthemore hu|suu|ui vanishes like (r  2m)2 for r  2m if
a = (4m)1. summarizing we have

2r4 # + (768m 2)1,
24r4  (768m 2)1# ,

comparison with eqs. (1.14) reveals

hu|sab|ui = hu|tab|ui .

(2.16)

(2.17)

it is quite interesting to examine the behaviour of the auxiliary eld . from eq. (2.9)
we see that the asymptotic requirement a = a yields   au as r  , whereas
the regularity condition on the horizon a = (4m)1 reveals that   v/4m + const.
as r  2m. we have therefore the nice connection:
a) for r   (we set b = 0)   u/4m  hu|sab|ui describes outgoing radiation;
b) for r  2m   v/4m +const.  hu|sab|ui describes an ingoing ux of negative
energy radiation;  and a, a, b = v, r regular on the future horizon  hu|sab|ui
regular on the future horizon.

iii) israel-hartle-hawking state |hi.
this state corresponds to thermal equilibrium and thus we demand  to be time in-
dependent, i.e. a = 0 which implies hh|srt|hi = 0. furthemore |hi is constructed
in a way that makes the stress tensor regular both on the future and past horizon,
which is achieved by requiring that as r  2m hh|suu|hi = hh|svv|hi vanish like
(r  2m)2. inspection of eqs. (2.11) reveals that we can fullll the above requirement
by demanding

a =

the state |hi

(2.20)

 = ln r +

+ b

r
2m

which is indeed regular. 1 we can make  vanishing on the horizon by choosing the
arbitrary constant b such that

b = (ln 2m + 1) ,

i.e. for the |hi state we have

 = ln r +

r
2m  (ln 2m + 1) .

(2.21)

(2.22)

note that this expression could have been derived by looking at the static solution of
the auxiliary eld equation (2.8) of the form

direct check with eqs. (1.15) reveals again the identity

hh|sab|hi = hh|tab|hi .

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

we have therefore shown in this simple 2d example the perfect agreement of our hsabi
and htabi. this is not surprising at all; it is a general feature not at all limited to the
2d schwarzschild background. it is well known that the auxiliary eld equation can
be integrated without making reference to any particular background. an arbitrary
2d spacetime

can always be parametrized as follows (conformal gauge)

ds2 = gabdxadxb

ds2 = e2dx+dx .

in that gauge the general solution of the equation for  (eq. (2.5) ) reads

1the other solution of eq. (2.18), namely a = 1/2m , makes  singular on the horizon.

 = 2 + f (x+) + g(x) ,

9

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

where f (x+) and g(x) are arbitrary functions of their arguments. inserting this in
eq. (2.6) we obtain hsabi. this has exactly the same form as htabi in eqs. (1.5) which,
as already said, can be derived by canonical quantization.
the motivation for our nonstandard derivation of the stress tensor for a conformal
scalar in 2d schwarzschild space-time was purely pedagogical2. it has shown explic-
itly how to implement state dependence in the framework of the anomaly induced
eective action by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the auxiliary eld 
(or equivalently on hsabi) which reect the physical properties of the quantum state.

3 four dimensions: reigerts action

having set the basis of our formalism we are ready to attack the physically more
interesting example: a conformal invariant scalar eld f in the 4d schwarzschild
black hole space-time. the classical action describing massless conformal invariant
scalar eld f is

s = z d4xg(cid:18)f f 

1
6

rf 2(cid:19) + svacuum ,

(3.1)

where the svacuum is necessary for the renormalizability of the theory (see [16] for the
general introduction to the renormalization in curved space-time). performing the
path integration over the scalar eld, one meets divergences and the renormalization
is necessary. the trace anomaly results from the renormalization of the vacuum action
in (3.1).

the vanishing of the classical trace has its quantum counterpart in the presence
of a trace anomaly, composed by the terms coming from the vacuum counterterms [4]

ht 

 i  hti = 

1

(4)2 (cid:16)ac 2 + be + cr(cid:17) .

(3.2)

for the free conformal invariant matter elds the three structures presented in

(3.2) are sucient, and the gr2-type counterterm does not arise. that is why

the corresponding term is absent in (3.2) 3.

the anomaly induced eective action which yields the anomaly (3.2) has been
independently derived by reigert [18] and fradkin and tseytlin [19] (see also [16,
20, 21, 22] for further applications and references about the reigerts action). the

2more detailed consideration, including critical analysis of the current literature, have been re-

ported separately in [17].

3also we notice that that there is no expression, local or nonlocal, in the eective action, which

could produce the term gr2 in the trace anomaly [18].

once the equations of motion for  and  are used, eq. (3.7) reduces to the nonlocal
form (3.3). we remark that the path integration over the auxiliary elds would give
an extra contribution to the anomaly (3.2), modifying the values of the constants
a, b, c in (3.2). here we consider the introduction of the auxiliary elds ,  as a
method of working with the nonlocalities of the expression (3.6) and hence require
the correspondence to hold only on classical level.
note that the last nonlocal term in eq. (3.6) (or equivalently the second integrand in
eq. (3.7) ) is conformally invariant and hence could be removed and included in the
weyl invariant part of the eective action sw (see eq. (1.8) ). for later use we shall

keep this term. however its coecient a/(8b) can be replaced by an arbitrary

parameter, say l1, since a change in this parameter can be reabsorbed by the weyl

11

invariant part sw (g) of sef f which is not determined by the trace anomaly.
so we shall work with the following anomaly induced eective action

the ricci tensor r or its contraction r. in our subsequent analysis the background

sum of the two terms linear in z in eq. (3.12), vanish identically.

and (d, a, b, c) are constants that specify the homogeneous solution 2
s = 0 and
hence the quantum state. the presence of a linear term in time in eq. (3.15) has the
same explanation given in section ii (see the discussion following eq. (2.10); it allows
hsrti 6= 0 but keeping thsi = 0). one can give solution for the equation of motion
for the other auxiliary eld  in the same form with obvious replacements

  48(k1 + k2)    48l1

and (d, a, b, c)  (d, a, b, c) .

substituting the solutions for the auxiliary elds in eqs. (3.12) we obtain the eective
stress tensor for the schwarzschild space-time in the form

hsi = hs()i + hs()i

separating the contribution of each individual eld to hsi. both  and  are related
to the inverse of the fourth order dierential operator 4, but they are independently

the qualitative agreement of our hb|s|bi and hb|t|bi of eqs. (1.16), (1.17) is

ii) unruh state |ui.
the unruh state |ui agrees with minkowski vacum on past null innity, i.e. no in-
coming radiation. this requires   u as r  , which implies hu|svv|ui  0 for
r  . this asymptotic behaviour of  is achieved by requiring b = 0 and d = a/2.
regularity along the future horizon requires   v and a  reg., a = v, r (see the
discussion following eq. (2.17)). this is achieved by xing e = 2dm (  v) and
a = /24m (a nite). that this is the correct choice it can be seen by direct
evaluation of hu|s|ui [25].

iii) israel-hartle-hawking state |hi.
this state is an equilibrium state regular both on the future and the past horizons.

inspection of eq. (3.18) reveals that  and r are regular both on the future and
the past horizons by imposing e = 0 and a = /24m. this leaves the parameter b
free. however, if the solution for  is obtained by an integral formula like eq. (2.23),
which sets the lower limit of integration to be r = 2m, we would obtain

as r  . the asymptotic limit of eq. (3.30) describes indeed a thermal bath as
expected (compare to eq. (1.20)). note the appearance of the factor (2  2) just as
in eq. (3.26).
putting some numbers, if we choose l1 = a
ef f to reigerts
one, we have the disappointing result (2  2) < 0 that is physically meaningless.
a similar situation was found in investigation of the anomaly induced eective action

8b which reconduces our san

15

representing 4d minimally coupled scalar elds spherically reduced to 2d at the clas-
sical level ( see [26]). for l1 = 0 (i.e. complete absorbtion of the conformally invariant
ef f in sw ) we nd that the overall coecient of eq. (3.30) is  2.2 104
part of our san
,
which is much bigger than the correct one  8 106
2m 4 . exact agreement of our result eq.
(3.30) and eq. (1.20) requires a ne tuning of the parameter , namely   6.2 101
.
for this value of  the luminosity of an evaporating black hole (see eq. (3.27)) turns
out to be l = 4.9 105
, which is roughly four times smaller than the value given in [13].

despite many nice features, there are some disappointing aspects of our hsi. the
overall coecient of hb|t|bi on the horizon is expected to be the same as the
asymptotic limit of hh|t|hi up to a minus sign (see eqs. (1.17) and (1.20) ). this
is not the case for hsi (compare eq. (3.22) and eq. (3.30) ).
unfortunately this is not all. if we go beyond the leading terms there is no agreement
of our hsi and hti. just to mention some negative aspects: hu|s 
 |ui  r3
in the limit r   while hu|t 
 |ui is expected to fall o as r4. furthemore in
the same limit the coecients in r1 and r2 of our hh|s|hi do not correspond
to redshifted thermal radiation as we have for hh|t|hi. one can guess that this
discrepancy may be removed by a careful modelling of the conformal part in (1.8)
through the introduction of other conformal structures [28], or, hopefully, by using
the results of some of the direct approximate calculations of the eective action (see,
for example, [29]).

4 conclusions

in a eld theory the knowledge of the trace anomaly allows part of the eective ac-
tion to be reconstructed; this is the so called anomaly induced eective action, i.e.
san
ef f . the basic features of this object are the nonlocality and the apparent absence
of any reference to a particular quantum state. auxiliary elds have been introduced
to make san
ef f local and boundary conditions have been imposed on them to select the
appropriate quantum states.
this procedure has been positively tested in a simple 2d example where san
ef f is the
well known polyakov action. we found exact agreement of the stress tensor calcu-
lated from this eective action (i.e. hsabi) and the one (htabi) resulting from standard
canonical quantization.
the expertise gained from the analysis of this simple 2d model has allowed us to attack
by similar methods the physically much more interesting example of 4d schwarzschild
black hole. we have been able to construct explicitly hsi for the three quantum
states relevant for the discussion of quantum matter elds in a black hole spacetime,
namely boulware state (vacuum polarization around a static star), unruh state (evap-
oration of a black hole formed by gravitational collapse) and israel-hartle-hawking
state (equilibrium of a black hole and a thermal bath).

16

by appropriate choice of the arbitrary parameter l1 of our model (or, equivalently, of
), we were able to show the qualitative agreement of our hsi and the canonically
computed hti at innity and near the horizon. unfortunately these nice features
cannot be extended beyond leading terms. this is expected since the fondamental
brick of our 4d investigation, namely san
ef f , up to a weyl invariant term coincides
with reigerts action.
it is well known [27] that this action is rather decitary if
considered as full eective action. unlike polyakovs action reigerts one is unable
even to correctly reproduce the three-point correlation function of the theory on the
at background. in view of this fact, the discrepancies found in our hsi are not
surprising at all.
what in our opinion is however remarkable is that, neverthless, our san
ef f does indeed
reproduce the expected behaviour of the stress tensor near the horizon and at innity
upon which our understanding of black hole evaporation is based.
in view of our investigation, a careful use (not a straightforward one) of hsi in the
semiclassical einstein equations to get at least a feeling of the backreaction in an
evaporating black hole can be made. we hope to come back to this point in a future
work.
