abstract. in this article i rst give an abbreviated history of
string theory and then describe the recently-conjectured eld-
string duality. this suggests a class of nonsupersymmetric gauge
theories which are conformal (cgt) to leading order of 1/n and
some of which may be conformal for nite n. these models are
very rigid since the gauge group representations of not only the
chiral fermions but also the higgs scalars are prescribed by the
construction. if the standard model becomes conformal at tev
scales the gut hierarchy is nullied, and model-building on
this basis is an interesting direction. some comments are added
about the dual relationship to gravity which is absent in the
cgt description.

1. abbreviated history of string theory

the recent development of eld string duality possesses some quality of deja
vu and yet seems the most promising development in the theory in terms
of its most optimistic prognosis that it may provide a successful connection
between string theory and the real world, and in doing so necessarily a rst
connection between gravity and the other interactions.

the initial seed of string theory was the veneziano model in 1968[1].
at the time, nite energy and superconvergence sum rules for hadron scat-
tering (the subject of my dphil thesis) posed a duality of descriptions
generally similar to the now-proposed one between a ten-dimensional su-
perstring (or 11 dimensional m theory) and a conformal gauge theory. the

hadron sum rules equated quantities of quite dierent functional depen-
dences on the mandelstam variables s and t, seemingly an impossibility
until the veneziano model showed an explicit realization.

from 1968 to 1973 the resultant dual resonance models were leading
candidates to describe the strong interactions. in 1973 they were, however,
elbowed aside by an alternative theory, quantum chromodynamics (qcd).
now the discarded theory is dual to the qcd which replaced it![2, 3]. this
is what i mean by deja vu.

the decade 1974-1984 saw a hiatus in string theory.

in 1984-85 the
first superstring revolution included a stab at nearly a theory of every-
thing, the perturbative e(8)  e(8) heterotic string[4]. but its apparent
uniqueness turned out to be illusory (as was its perturbativity), and an-
other decade 1985-95 of quiescence followed.

in 1995 came the second superstring evolution, and in 1997 the 2 1
2 -
revolution with ads/cft duality. understanding of duality between weak
and strong coupling of supersymmetric eld theories led to a corresponding
breakthrough in string theory culminating with the idea of m theory as
a more basic theory which unied all of the ve known ten-dimensional
superstings (types i, iia, iib and the o32 and e8  e8 heterotic strings)
as well as eleven-dimensional supergravity by duality transformations.

one of the most important realizations of the recent period is that
string solitons, or d branes, play a dynamical role in the theory equally
as important as do the superstrings themselves. d branes are crucial for
the eld-string duality which is our principal subject. the string duality
has also led to a better understanding of the quantum mechanics of black
holes.

our starting point here is the duality between string theory in 10 di-
mensions (or of m theory in 11 dimensions) and gauge eld theory in four
dimensions. as already mentioned, this in a real sense closes a 25-year
cycle in the history of strings.

certainly one of the major changes in string theory in the recent years
is the appreciation of the role of d branes which are topological defects on
which open strings can end. their necessity in string theory was realized
only in 1989[5] and particularly in 1995[6]. their presence follows from
considering the r  0 limit of a bosonic string compactied on a circle of
radius r. open strings, unlike the closed strings which are necessarily con-
tained in the same theory, cannot wrap around the compactied dimension
in the r  0 limit. hence for a consistent theory the open strings do not
simply end, but are attached to d branes.

these d branes have their own dynamics and play a central role in the
full non-perturbative theory. d branes have provided insight into (1) black
hole quantum mechanics; (2) large n gauge eld theory (discussed here).

in general, the term duality applies to a situation where two quite

dierent descriptions are available for the same physics.

the dierence can be very striking. for example, in 1997 maldacena[2]
proposed the duality between d = 4 su (n ) gauge eld theory (gft)
and a d = 10 superstring.
in the perturbative regime of the gft this
duality cannot hold just because the degrees of freedom are missing, but
non-perturbatively the gft contains sucient additional states at strong
coupling for the duality to be indeed possible.

take a type iib superstring (closed, chiral) in d = 10 and compactify

it on the manifold:

(ads)5  s5

(1)

here (ads)5 is a 5-dimensional anti de sitter space whose four dimensional
surface m4 is the d = 4 spacetime in which the su (n ) gft occurs. note
that the isometry group of (ads)5 is so(4, 2), the conformal group for
four dimensional spacetime. the s5 is a ve-sphere with isometry su (4)
which is the r symmetry of the resultant n = 4 supersymmetric su (n )
gft. the s5 can be regarded as a surface in a c3 three-dimensional space
in which n d3 branes are coincident.

the d branes each carry an associated u (1) gauge symmetry. this
is understandable as a correct generalization of the chan-paton factors[7]
which were once used to attach charges to the ends of open strings. n
parallel d branes with vanishing separation yield a u (n ) gauge group
where the additional n 2  n gauge bosons arise from connecting open
strings which become massless in the zero-length limit. this u (n ) turns
out to be broken to su (n ) by the brane dynamics. the resultant n = 4
susy yang-mills theory is well-known to be a very well-behaved, nite
eld theory. it is conformally invariant even for nite n with all rg 
functions (gauge, yukawa and quartic higgs) vanishing.

this perturbative niteness was proved in 1983 by mandelstam[8]. the
maldacena conjecture is primarily aimed at the n   limit with the
t hooft parameter[9] of n times the squared gauge coupling xed, and
makes no claim concerning conformality for nite n [10]. but since the
n = 4 case is known to be conformal even for nite n one is tempted to
extend the conjecture[11] to nite n cases even where all supersymmetry
is broken. in that case the standard model can be a part of a conformal
nonsupersymmetric gauge theory where the  functions become zero at
a tev scale. then the coupling constants cease to run and there is no
grand unication. this nullies the gauge hierarchy problem between the
weak scale and the gut scale, and yet it is still possible to derive the
correct electroweak mixing angle[12]. in particular there is no reason to
invoke low-energy supersymmetry either. gravity is itself non-conformal
(it necessitates the dimensionful newton constant). we shall address this
at the end of the article.

2. breaking supersymmetries.

to approach the real world one needs less supersymmetry than n = 4, in
fact the empirical data presently suggest no supersymmetry at all, n = 0.
by factoring out a discrete group (we shall assume it is an abelian
discrete group, only because that case has been most fully investigated; it is
possible that a non-abelian discrete group can work as well) and composing
the orbifold:

s5/

(2)

one may break n = 4 supersymmetry to n = 2, 1 or 0. of special interest
is the n = 0 case.

we may take  = zp which identies p points in c3.
the rule for breaking the n = 4 supersymmetry is:

  su (2) = n = 2

  su (3) = n = 1

 6 su (3) = n = 0

(3)

(4)

(5)

in fact, to specify the embedding of  = zp, we need to identify three

integers ai = (a1, a2, a3) such that the action of zp on c3 is:

c3 : (x1, x2, x3)

zp (a1 x1, a2x2, a3 x3)

with

 = exp(cid:18) 2i
p (cid:19)

(6)

(7)

the scalar multiplet is in the 6 of su (4) r symmetry and is transformed

by the zp transformation:

diag(a1, a2 , a3 , a1 , a2 , a3 )

together with the gauge transformation

diag(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  i

(8)

(9)

for the dierent su (n )i of the gauge group su (n )p.

what will be relevant are states invariant under a combination of these

two transformations, as discussed in the next subsection.

if a1 + a2 + a3 = 0

(mod p) then the matrix

a1




a2

4




a3

(10)

is in su (3) and hence n  1 is unbroken and this condition must therefore
be avoided if we want n = 0.

if we examine the 4 of su (4), we nd that the matter which is invariant
under the combination of the zp and an su (n )p gauge transformation can
be deduced similarly.

it is worth dening the spinor 4 explicitly by aq = (a1, a2, a3, a4) with
the aq, like the ai, dened only mod p. explicitly we may dene a1 =
a1 +a2, a2 = a2 +a3, a3 = a3 +a1 and a4 = (a1 +a2 +a3). in other
words, a1 = 1
2 (a1  a2 + a3), a2 = 1
2 (a1 + a2 + a3),
and a4 =  1
2 (a1 + a2 + a3). to leave no unbroken supersymmetry we must
obviously require that all aq are non-vanishing.
in terms of the ai this
condition which we shall impose is:

2 (a1 + a2  a3), a3 = 1

i=3

xi=1

(ai) 6= 0

(mod p)

(11)

the question at issue is whether the gauge theories derived in this way
are conformal for nite n. what is known is that at leading order in 1/n
the  functions vanish to all orders in perturbation theory[13]. this is
already remarkable from the eld theory point of view because without the
stimulus of the ads/cft duality it would be dicult to guess any n = 0
theory with all  functions zero to leading order in 1/n and all orders in
the gft coupling. without non-renormalization theorems this imposes an
innite number of constraints on a nite number of choices of the fermion
and scalar representations of su (n )p.

nevertheless, since n = 4 is conformal (all  functions vanish) we
can be more ambitious and ask[11] that all  functions vanish even for
nite n , at least for some xed point in coupling constant space, and use
the construction to motivate phenomenological model-building.

3. matter representations.

the zp group identies p points in c3. the n converging d branes ap-
proach all p such points giving a gauge group with p factors:

su (n )  su (n )  su (n )  ....  su (n )

(12)

the matter which survives is invariant under a product of a gauge trans-
formation and a zp transformation.

for the covering gauge group su (pn ), the transformation is:

(1, 1, ..., 1; , , ....; 2, 2, ...2; ......; p1, p1, ...p1)

(13)

5

with each entry occurring n times.

under the zp transformation for the scalar elds, the 6 of su (4), the

tranformation is

 x  (a1 , a2 , a3 )

(14)

the result can conveniently be summarized by a quiver diagram[14].
one draws p points and for each ak one draws a non-directed arrow between
all modes i and i+ak. each arrow denotes a bi-fundamental representation
such that the resultant scalar representation is:

k=3

xk=1

i=p

xi=1

(ni, niak )

(15)

if ak = 0 the bifundamental is to be reinterpreted as an adjoint represen-
tation plus a singlet representation.

for the chiral fermions one must construct the spinor 4 of su (4). the
components are the aq given above. the resultant fermion representation
follows from a dierent quiver diagram. one draws p points and connects
with a directed arrow the node i to the node i + aq. the fermion repres-
ntation is then:

q=4

i=p

(ni, ni+aq )

xq=1

xi=1

(16)

since all aq 6= 0, there are no adjoint representations for fermions. this
completes the matter representation of su (n )p.

4. two-loop - functions.

we know that if  is absent the resultant n = 4 susy su(n) gft has
g = y = h = 0 to all orders of perturbation theory.

when supersymmetries are broken one must check in more detail:

g = (1)

g + (2)

g

where

(1)
g = 

g3

(4)2 (cid:20) 11

3

c2(g) 

4
3

s2(f ) 

1
6

s2(s)(cid:21)

(17)

(18)

here the quadratic casimir is c2(g) = n . the dynkin indices are
s2(f ) = 4n and s2(s) = 6n for the fermion ( = 1/2 for weyl spinors)
and scalar representations respectively.

thus (1)

g = 0.

6

the general expression for (2)

g

has six terms. see [15]. the 1st, 3rd

and 5th of the six terms are the same in all theories, namely:

34n 2

3



40n 2

3

 2n 2 = 4n 2

(19)

in the 2nd and 4th terms there is an implicit sum over irreducible
representations. in the 6th term are yukawa couplings y4(f ) which are
included in this order because y4(f )  g2.

it is amusing to obtain an idea of how many candidates there are for

n = 0 d = 4 conformal theories following these rules.

each ai can, without loss of generality, be in the range 0  ai  (p 
1). further we may set a1  a2  a3 since permutations of the ai are
equivalent. let us dene k(p) to be the number of possible n = 0 theories
with k non-zero ai (1  k  3).

since ai = (0, 0, a3) is clearly equivalent to ai = (0, 0, p  a3) the value

of 1(p) is

1(p) = p/2

(20)

where x is the largest integer not greater than x.

for 2(p) we observe that ai = (0, a2, a3) is equivalent to ai = (0, p 
a3, p  a2). then we may derive, taking into account eq.(11), that, for p
even

2(p) = 2

 p2

xr=1

r =

p(p  2)

while, for p odd

2(p) = 2

 p2

xr=1

r + 

p

 =

4

(p  1)2

(22)

for 3(p), the counting is only slightly more intricate. there is the
equivalence of ai = (a1, a2, a3) with (p  a3, p  a2, p  a1) as well as
eq.(11) to contend with.

in particular the theory ai = (a1, p/2, p  a1) is a self-equivalent (se)
one; let the number of such theories be se(p). then it can be seen that
se(p) = p/2 for p even, and se(p) = 0 for p odd. with regard to

eq.(11), let p(p) be the number of theories with p ai = p and 2p(p) be
the number with p ai = 2p. then because of the equivalence of (a1, a2, a3)

7

with (p  a3, p  a2, p  a1), it follows that p(p) = 2p(p). the value will
be calculated below; in terms of it 3(p) is given by

3(p) =

1
2

[(p)  2p(p) + se(p)]

(23)

where (p) is the number of unrestricted (a1, a2, a3) satisfying 1  ai 
(p  1) and a1  a2  a3. its value is given by

(p) =

p1

xa3=1

it remains only to calculate p(p) given by

p(p) =

xa1=1

(cid:18)(cid:22) p  a1

2

(cid:23)  a1 + 1(cid:19)

(24)

(25)

the value of p(p) depends on the remainder when p is divided by 6. to
show one case in detail consider p = 6k where k is an integer. then

p(p) =

2k1

xa1=odd

t ot al(p) = 1(p) + 2(p) + 3(p) =

and nally for p = 6k + 3

table 1 (next page) gives values of 1(p), 2(p), 3(p), t ot al(p),

the next question is: of all these candidates for conformal n = 0
theories, how many if any are conformal? as a rst sifting we can apply
the criterion found in[11] from vanishing of the two-loop rge function,
(2)
g = 0, for the gauge coupling. the criterion is that a1 + a2 = a3. let
us denote the number of theories fullling this by alive(p).

if p is odd there is no contamination by self-equivalent possibilities and

the result is

alive =

p1

2

xr=1

(p  2r) =

1
4

(p  1)2

(p = odd)

(35)

for p even some self equivalent cases must be subtracted. the sum in
eq.(35) is 1
4 p(p  2) and the number of self-equivalent cases to remove is
p/4 with the results

alive =

(p = 4k)

alive =

(p = 4k + 2)

(36)

(37)

in the last two columns of table 1 are the values of alive(p) and

pp
p=2 alive(p).
asymptotically for large p the ratio alive(p)/t ot al(p)  3/p and
hence vanishes although alive(p) diverges; the value of the ratio is e.g.
0.28 at p = 5 and at p = 41 is 0.066. it is being studied how the two-loop
requirements (2)
h = 0 select from such theories. that result
will further indicate whether any alive(p) can survive to all orders.

y = 0 and (2)

5. directions.

we have begun ther selection process by looking at one and two loop.
at one loop we are still at leading order in n at least for g so there is
coincidence with the n = 4 case. at 2 loops we found already that only 8%

9

of a sample satisfy one criterion, the fraction remaining alive diminishing
like 3/p for large p.

checking the yukawa and higgs running for 2 loops needs more calcu-

lation of couplings and is underway.

beyond that:

 if all 2-loop tests are satised, what about 3 or more? it rapidly

becomes impractical to take the approach of direct calculation.

 there is the question of uniqueness of any surviving n = 0 cgt.

 the cgt may be inspirational in model building, to be discussed

below.

why n = 0 ?.
n = 1 is motivated by accommodation of the gauge hierarchy

mgu t /mw eak.

in a conformal gauge theory the gauge couplings cease to run and the

gut scale does not exist; this hierarchy is therefore nullied.

low-scale kaluza-klein[16] is similar to the conformality approach in

this particular regard, although the idea is quite dierent.

more philosophically, we may recall the over 50 years ago the innite
renormalization of qed was greeted with much skepticism.
if the con-
formality of even n = 4 cft had been already discovered, surely the
skepticism would have been far greater?

6. conformality and particle phenomenology.

let us itemize the following points:

 the hierarchy between the gut and weak scales is 14 orders of mag-

nitude.

 why do the two very dierent scales exist?

 how are the scales stabilized under quantum corrections?

 supersymmetry solves the second problem but not the rst.

successes of supersymmetry.

 cancellations of uv innities.

 technical naturalness of hierarchy.

 unication of gauge couplings.

 natural appearance in string theory.

puzzles about supersymmetry.

 the mu problem - why is the higgs mass at the weak scale and not

at the planck scale (hierarchy).

 breaking supersymmetry leads to too large a cosmological constant.

 is supersymmetry fundamental to string theory?

 there are solutions of string theory without supersymmetry.

supersymmetry replaced by conformality at tev scale.
the following aspects of the idea are discussed:

 the idea is possible.

 explicit examples containing standard model states.

 finiteness as a more rigid constraint than supersymmetry.

 predicts additional states for niteness/conformality.

 rich inter-family structure of yukawa couplings.

7. conformality as hierarchy solution.

the quark and lepton masses, the qcd scale and the weak scale are ex-
tremely small compared to a tev scale. they may all be put to zero sug-
gesting: add degrees of freedom to yield gft with conformal invariance
(cgt). t hoofts naturalness condition holds since zero mass increases the
symmetry.

the theory is assumed to be given by the action[17]

s = s0 +z d4xioi

(38)

where s0 is the action for the conformal theory and the oi are operators
with dimension below four which break conformal invariance softly.

the mass parameters i have mass dimension 4  i where i is the

dimension of oi at the conformal point.

let m be the scale set by the parameters i and hence the scale at
which conformal invariance is broken. then for e  m the couplings
will not run while they start running for e < m . to solve the hierarchy
problem we assume m is close to the tev scale.

8. large class of d=4 qfts - each su(4) subgroup.

there is rst the choice of n . one knows that for leading 1/n the theory
is conformal. what about nite n? one expects at least a conformal xed
point in some cases. one starts from n = 4 gft, eliminates elds and
re-identies others such that conformality results.

it is important to realize that, even without supersymmetry, boson-

fermion number equality holds, and underlies the niteness.

let   su (4) denote a discrete subgroup of su (4). consider irre-
ducible representations of . suppose there are k irreducible representa-
tions ri, with dimensions di with i = 1, ..., k. the gauge theory in question
has gauge symmetry

su (n d1)  su (n d2)  ...su (n dk)

the fermions in the theory are given as follows. consider the 4 dimensional
representation of  induced from its embedding in su (4). it may or may
not be an irreducible representation of . we consider the tensor product
of 4 with the representations ri:

4  ri = jnj

i rj

13

the chiral fermions are in bifundamental representations

(1, 1, .., ndi, 1, ..., ndj, 1, ..)

with multiplicity nj
the sense that we obtain ni
note that we can equivalently view nj
tions in the tensor product

i dened above. for i = j the above is understood in
i neutral elds of su (n di).
i as the number of trivial representa-

i adjoint elds plus ni

(4  ri  r

j )trivial = nj

i

the asymmetry between i and j is manifest in the above formula. thus

in general we have

nj
i 6= ni

j

and so the theory in question is in general a chiral theory. however if 
is a real subgroup of su (4), i.e. if 4 = 4 as far as  representations are
concerned, then we have by taking the complex conjugate:

nj
i = (4  ri  r

j )trivial = (4  r

i  rj)trivial = ni
j.

so the theory is chiral if and only if 4 is a complex representation of ,
i.e. if and only if 4 6= 4 as a representation of . if  were a real subgroup
of su (4) then nj

i = ni
j.

if  is a complex subgroup, the theory is chiral, but it is free of gauge
anomalies. to see this, note that the number of chiral fermions in the
fundamental representation of each group su (n di) plus n di times the
number of chiral fermions in the adjoint representation is given by

nj
i n dj = 4n di

xj

(where the number of adjoints is given by ni
anti-fundamentals plus n di times the number of adjoints is given by

i). similarly the number of

xj

ni

jn dj = x n dj(4rjr

i )trivial = x n dj(4r

j ri)trivial = 4n di

thus we see that the dierence of the number of chiral fermions in the
fundamental and the anti-fundamental representation is zero (note that the
adjoint representation is real and does not contribute to anomaly). thus
each gauge group is anomaly free.

in addition to fermions we also have bosons in bi-fundamental repre-
sentations. the number of bosons m j
i in the bi-fundamental representation
of su (n di)  su (n dj) is given by the number of rj representations in

14

the tensor product of the representation 6 of su (4) restricted to  with
the ri representation. note that since 6 is a real representation we have

m j

i = (6  ri  r

j )trivial = (6  r

i  rj)trivial = m i

j

in other words for each m j
sponding bi-fundamental representation.

i we have a complex scalar eld in the corre-

interactions. the interactions of the gauge elds with the matter is
xed by the gauge coupling constants for each gauge group. the inverse
coupling constant squared for the i-th group combined with the theta angle
for the i-th gauge group is

i = i +

i

4g2

where  =  + i
gauge group and || denotes the number of elements in .

4g2 is an arbitrary complex parameter independent of the

there are two other kinds of interactions: yukawa interactions and
quartic scalar eld interactions. the yukawa interactions are in 1-1 corre-
spondence with triangles in the quiver diagram with two directed fermionic
edges and one undirected scalar edge, with compatible directions of the
fermionic edges:

sy ukawa =

1
g2

xdirected triangles

dabctra

ij b

jk c

ki

where a, b, c denote a degeneracy label of the corresponding elds. dabc
are avor dependent numbers determined by clebsch-gordon coecients
as follows: a, b, c determine elements u, v, w (the corresponding trivial rep-
resentation) in 4  ri  r

k and 4  rk  r

j , 6  rj  r

i . then

dabc = u  v  w

where the product on the right-hand side corresponds to contracting the
corresponding representation indices for rms with r
ms as well as contract-
ing the (4  6  4) according to the unique su (4) trivial representation in
this tensor product.

similarly the quartic scalar interactions are in 1-1 correspondence with
the 4-sided polygons in the quiver diagram, with each edge corresponding
to an undirected line. we have

squartic =

1

g2 x4gons

f abcda

ij b

jk c

kl d

li

where again the elds correspond to lines a, b, c, d which in turn determine
an element in the tensor products of the form 6  rm  r
n. f abcd is

15

obtained by contraction of the correponding element as in the case for
yukawa coupling and also using a [, ][, ] contraction in the 6666
part of the product.

conformal theories in 4 dimensions. there follows a large list of quan-
tum eld theories in 4 dimensions, one for each discrete subgroup of su (4)
and each choice of integer n , motivated from string theory considerations
which has been proven to have vanishing beta function to leading order in
n . below we argue for the existence of at least one xed point even for
nite n (under some technical assumptions). the vanishing of the beta
function at large n can also be argued using ads/cft correspondence.

consider strong-weak duality. this duality exchanges 8g2  1/8g2
(at  = 0). this follows from their embedding in the type iib string
theory which enjoys the same symmetry. in fact, this gauge theory denes
a particular type iib string theory background and so this symmetry must
be true for the gauge theory as well. in the leading order in n the beta
function vanishes. let us assume at the next order there is a negative beta
function, i.e., that we have an asymptotically free theory. then the ow
towards the infrared increases the value of the coupling constant. similarly,
by the strong-weak duality, the ow towards the infrared at large values
of the coupling constant must decrease the value of the coupling constant.
therefore we conclude that the beta function must have at least one zero
for a nite value of g.

this argument is not rigorous for three reasons: one is that we ignored
the ow for the  angle. this can be remedied by using the fact that the
moduli space is the upper half-plane modulo sl(2, z) which gives rise to a
sphere topology and using the fact that any vector eld has a zero on the
sphere (it is impossible to comb the hair on a sphere). the second reason
is that we assumed asymptotic freedom at the rst non-vanishing order in
the large n expansion. this can in principle be checked by perturbative
techniques and at least it is not a far-fetched assumption. more serious,
however, is the assumption that there is eectively one coupling constant.
it would be interesting to see if one can relax this assumption, which is
valid at large n .

9. comments

the most exciting aspect of the conformality approach is in model building
beyond the standard model. the reason the model building is so interest-
ing is that not only the fermion but also the scalar representations are pre-
scribed by the construction. thus one may not simply add whatever higgs
scalars are required for the appropriate symmetry breaking. this rigidity is

16

actually helpful. lack of adequate space precludes including details of the
model building described in[12, 18]. clearly a simple model would encour-
age support for this approach. the simplest model using abelian orbifolds
and found in [18] is based on the gauge group su (3)7. this has less gen-
erators than the e(6) gauge group and may therefore be of considerable
interest. non-abelian orbifolds are currently under examination.

the nal issue concerns gravity. in the cgt for strong and electroweak
interactions there is no manifest gravity. one may say there is no evidence
for a graviton and that one is concerned only with observable physics. nev-
ertheless if one extrapolates to extremely high energy gravity should enter
and it is not conformally invariant because, of course, the newton constant
is dimensional. it would be attractive to understand the incorporation of
gravitation while staying in only four spacetime dimensions but this possi-
bility remains elusive. the cgt itself stands on its own without need of
the string from which its construction was inferred. but to describe grav-
ity the most promising idea seems to be to add an extra dimension and
consider (ads)5. keeping the full range of the fth coordinate leads one
back to the absence of gravity on the surface. but, as pointed out in [19],
truncating the range of the fth coordinate leads to a metric eld on the
surface and hence to a graviton.

as a nal speculation, is it possible that conformality is related to the
vanishing cosmological constant? until conformal invariance is broken the
vacuum energy is zero. it then depends on how softly conformal invariance
can be broken if a (t ev )4 contribution is to be avoided. clearly, the
breaking of conformal invariance needs to be studied, not only for this
reason, but also to allow predictions for dimensionless quantities like mass
ratios and mixing angles in the low-energy theory.
