(1) expression, (s) n-dimensional vector, a(s) matrix valued function, prime indicates dierentiation. so, two real numbers b, problem obtain (b) given (a). deal problem, make partition p = {s0, s1, . . . , sn} interval . let sk = sk sk1 k = 1, . . . , n, set = s0, b = sn. then, solving dierential equation subinterval, write approximately  (b) n yk=1 ea(sk)sky (a) p(a)y (a). (2) 2 since a(s) matrix valued, order product important. let (p ) length longest sk partition p . then, (p ) 0, get (b) = lim (p )0 p (a)y (a). (3) limit clearly valid (a). limit ordered product right hand side eq.(3) funda- mental expression denition product integral . formally dened, obvious notation, x ya ea(s)ds = lim (p )0 p (a) f (x, a). easy see f (x, a) satises dierential equation dx f (x, a) = a(x)f (x, a) f (a, a) = 1. corresponding integral equation f (x, a) = 1 +z x ds a(s)f (s, a). (4) (5) (6) clearly, f (a, a) = 1, f (x, a) unique. consider properties product integral matrices. x product integral non-singular, determinant given det x ya ea(s)ds! = er x tra(s)ds. (7) analogy additive property ordinary integrals, product integrals multiplicative property, composition rule, ea(s)ds = x yz ea(s)ds x yy yz ea(s)ds. (8) x, y, z z x. result independent choice decomposition products right hand side. derivatives respect end points given x x yy ea(s)ds = a(x) ea(s)ds, x yy x yy ea(s)ds = x yy ea(s)dsa(y). 3 (9) (10) ya one fundamental features associated connection notion parallel transport. see formulated product integral formalism, consider map p :  cnn, continuously dierentiable. p (x) indenite product integral given a(s) x p (x) = ea(s)dsp (a). (11) next, dene operation known l operation like logarithmic derivative operation non-singular functions. let prime indicates dierentiation. then, eq. (11) follows lp (x) = p (x)p 1(x), (12) . one byproducts operation (lp )(x) = a(x) l(p q)(x) = lp (x) + p (x)(lq(x))p 1(x). (13) l operation crucial ingredient establishing analog fundamental theorem calculus product integrals. map p dened above, theorem states x e(lp )(s)ds = p (x)p 1(a). (14) ya results given above, follows p solution initial value problem p (x) = (lp )(x)p (x). (15) unique solution given eq.

(16) finally, state two important properties product integrals used sequel. one similarity theorem states x x p (x) eb(s)dsp 1(a) = eds. ya ya property dierentiation respect parameter. let (17) (18) ya ya x yy p (x, y; ) = ea(s;)ds, parameter. dierentiation rule respect parameter given a(s; )p (s, y; ). (19) p (x, y; ) = z x dsp (x, s; ) 4 iii non-abelian stokes theorem provide background using product integral formalism section ii prove non-abelian stokes theorem, begin statement problem arises physical context. let n-dimensional manifold representing space-time (target space). let (connection) 1-form m. dierentiable manifold, choose local basis dx, = 1, ..., n, express terms components: a(x) = a(x) dx. take values lie-algebra, representation thereof, lie group. then, tk, k = 1, .., m, representing generators lie group, components written a(x) = ak (x) tk. preliminaries, express path ordered phase factor non- abelian gauge theories  form p indicates path ordering, c path m. path c closed, corresponding holonomy operator becomes: wab(c) = per b a. w (c) = peh a. (20) path c described terms intrinsic parameter , points x lie path c, x = x(). one write a(x())dx = a()d, a() a(x()) dx() . quantity a(), variations thereof, identify matrix valued functions product integral formalism. let us next consider loop operator. simplicity, assume trivial rst homology group integer coecients, i.e., h1(m, z) = 0. insures loop may taken boundary two dimensional surface m. explicitly, take 2-surface orientable submanifold m. convenient describe properties 2-surface terms intrinsic parameters a, = 0, 1. so, points manifold m, lie , x = x(, ). components 1-form obtained means vielbeins (by standard pull-back construction): v = x (). 5 thus, get aa = v a. curvature 2-form f connection given f = da + = 1 2 f dx dx. components f obtained means vielbeins: fab = v v b f. want express loop operator terms product integral denition specic way. achieve this, begin denition path ordered phase factor terms product integral. consider continuous map :  cnn  real interval. then, dene non-abelian phase factor given terms product integral follows: s0 per s1 a(s)ds s1 ys0 ea(s)ds. particular, anticipating identify closed path c wilson loop dened boundary 2-surface, convenient work beginning matrix valued functions a(, ). means expression path ordered phase factor depend parameter. is, let :   cnn, (21)   real intervals two surface hence m. then, dene path ordered phase factor p (, 0; ) = y0 ea1(; )d per 0 a1(; )d . (22) expression, p indicates path ordering respect , dened product integral, parameter. able describe operator closed path, similarly dene path dependent operator q(; , 0) = y0 ea0(; )d per 0 a0(; )d . (23) case, path ordering respect , parameter. prove non-abelian version stokes theorem, want make use product integration techniques express holonomy loop operator integral two dimensional surface bounded corresponding loop. terms intrinsic coordinates surface, write loop operator form w (c) = peh aada , 6 (24) where, mentioned above, = (, ) ; = (0, 1). (25) expression loop operator depends homotopy class paths closed path c belongs. can, therefore, parameterize path c convenient manner consistent homotopy class. particular, break path piece wise continuous segments along either remains constant. composition rule product integrals given eq. (8) ensures break closed loop number segments depend intermediate points closed path, used purpose. so, write closed loop operator w = w4 w3 w2 w1, (26) expression, wk, k = 1, .., 4, wilson lines = const. along w1 w3, = const. along w2 w4. emphasize expressions = const. = const. represent arbitrary curves. see advantage parameterizing closed path manner, consider exponent eq. (24) : aada = a0d + a1d. (27) along segment, one terms right hand side vanishes. = 0 = const.. recalling eqs. (22) example, along segment , (23), get segments w1 w2, respectively, w1 = y0 ea1(;0)d per 0 a1(;0)d = p (, 0; 0), (28) w2 = y0 ea0(; )d per 0 a0(; )d = q(; , 0). (29) 2-surface requires one coordinate patch cover it, connections dierent coordinate patches must related overlap region transition functions . then, decomposition given eq. (26) must suitably augmented take complication account. product integral representation path ordered phase factor composition rule product integrals given eq. (8) still make possible describe corresponding loop operator composite product integral. deniteness, conne representation given eq. (26). convenient later purposes dene two composite wilson line operators u according u(, ) = q(; , 0) p (, 0; ), (30) 7 using rst these, (; ) = p (, 0; ) q(0; , 0). similarly, w3 w4 w2 w1 = u(, ). w3 = p 1(, 0; ), w4 = q1(0; , 0). eq. (31), follows w4 w3 = 1(, ). (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) appealing eq. (8) composition product integrals, clear expression wilson loop operator independent choice point (, ). terms quantities u, closed loop operator take compact form w = 1(; )u(; ). (36) rst step proof non-abelian stokes theorem, obtain action l-derivative operator w : l w = l . (37) using denition l-operation given eq. (12), noting p (, 0; 0) independent , carrying l operations right hand side (rhs), get l w = l 1(, ) + 1(, ) t (, ). (38) simplifying expression means eqs. (12) (13), end l w = 1(, )t (, ). (39) next, prove analog eq. integral, composite loop operator dened eqs. (26) (36). (14), applies elementary product theorem 1 loop operator given eq. (36) expressed form w = y0 et 1(, )t (, )d . (40) 8 prove theorem, rst note denition l operation right hand side (rhs) equation written rhs = y0 ed . (41) noting 1 = l , use similarity theorem given eq. (17) obtain rhs = 1(; ) y0 ea0(; )d (; 0). (42) moreover, making use dening eq. (23), get rhs = 1(; ) q(; , 0) p (, 0; 0) q(; 0, 0) = 1(; ) u(; ). (43) last line clearly expression w given eq. (36). finally, want express quantity w yet another form state as: theorem 2 loop operator dened eq. (36) expressed surface integral eld strength: w = y0 0 er 1(; )f01(; )t (; )dd (44) f01 0-1 component non-abelian eld strength. prove theorem, note  = 1(, )  (, ). (45) moreover, {t 1(, ) (l (, )) (, )} = 1(, ) a1(, )t (, ). (46) follows {t 1(, )}t (, )} = 1(, )}t (, ) = 1(, )f01(, )t (, ). (47) last step follows denition eld strength terms connection given f0 1 = a0(, ) a1(, ) + . (48) 9 integrating eq. (47) respect , get 1(, )}t (, ) 1(; )f0 1(; )t (; )dd . = z 0 thus arrive surface integral representation loop operator {$9712120$}: w = y0 0 er 1(; )f0 1(; )t (; )dd . (49) (50) note expression ordering operators dened respect whereas parameter. recalling antisymmetry components eld strength, rewrite expression terms path ordered exponentials familiar physics literature: w = p e dabt 1(; )fab(; )t (; ), (51) 1 2r dab area element 2-surface. despite appearances, must remembered play dierent roles expression. iv second proof illustrate power exibility product integral formalism, give variant previous proof non-abelian stokes theorem. time proof makes essential use non-trivial relation (19) product integrals. start form w given eq. (36) take derivatives respect : w = q1(0; , 0)p 1(, 0; )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0) + +q1(0; , 0) p 1(, 0; )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0) + +q1(0; , 0)p 1(, 0; ) q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0). (52) here, made use fact p (, 0; 0) independent . applying eq. (12) w using eq. (31), get l w = w w 1 = 1(; )  (; ). (53) use eq. respect parameter : (19) evaluate derivative product integral p (, 0; ) = z 0 dp (, ; ) a1(; )p (, 0; ). (54) 10 then, simple manipulations using dening equations various terms eq. (53), get: 1(; ) p ( )p 1( )t (; ) = z 0 dt 1(; ) a1(; )t (; ). (55) using eq. (9) fact p (0, 0; ) = 1, write rest eq. (53) integral too: 1(; )t (; ) = = q1(0; , 0)q(0; , 0) = 0 p 1(, 0; )( a0(, ) + )p (, 0; ). (56) = r combining eqs. (53), (55), (56), obtain: l w = w w 1 = z 0 dt 1(, )f01(, )t (, ). (57) finally, recalling eq. (14), immediately led eq. (50) obtained previous method proof. two reasons relative simplicity proof one given previous section. one due use dierentiation respect parameter according eq. (19). due use eq. (14) composite operator w . rst proof, use theorem w assumed. justication using second proof lies composition law product integrals given eq.

(50) gauge covariant. end, recalled gauge trans- formation, components connection, i.e. gauge potentials, transform according  a(x) g(x)a(x)g1(x) g(x)g(x)1. components eld strength (curvature) transform covariantly: f(x) g(x)f(x)g1(x). these, follows  a(x)dx per b g(b)(cid:18)per b a(x)dx(cid:19) g1(a), 11 (58) (59) (60) equivalently, dinition (22) terms product integrals, easy show gauge transform quantity p (, 0; ) form g(; )g1(0; ) y0 eg(0; )a1(; )g1(0; ). (61) show gauge covariance surface representation, need know operator (, ) transforms gauge transformations. end, note wilson line q(; , 0) given eq. (23) transforms q(; , 0) = y0 ea0(; )d g(; )q(; , 0)g1(; 0). (62) then, gauge transform composite operator (, ) given eq. (31) follows immediately: (; ) = p (, 0; ) q(0; , 0) g(; )t (; )g1(0; 0). (63) results, straight forward show surface integral representation wilson loop transforms w y0 e g(0;0)(cid:16)r 0 1(; )f01(; )t (; )dt(cid:17)g1(0;0) . (64) follows composition rule (8) constant factors exponent factorize, gauge transformations surface representation transforms covariantly, i.e., w g(0; 0) y0 0 er 1(; )f01(; )t (; )dt g1(0; 0). (65) view result nontrivial conrmation proofs. vi concluding remarks provided two proofs non-abelian stokes theorem using product integral method. immediate question comes mind whether supersymmetric generalization theorem. given important developments supersymmetric gauge theories recent years, question merely academic interest. explore possibility using product integral method, necessary generalize method encompass grassmann valued operators. turns generalization indeed possible . developments subject reported forthcoming work. 12 work supported part department energy contract number doe-fgo2-84er40153. hospitality aspen center physics summer 1998 also gratefully acknowledged. also grateful dr. m. awada valuable input initial stages work. 13
