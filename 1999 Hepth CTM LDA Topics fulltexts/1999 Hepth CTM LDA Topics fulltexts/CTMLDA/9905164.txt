(12) thus need realize one element similarity classes. let us, thus, turn realization nonregular cases. need distinguish two possibilities: 1) p 6= 2, 2) p = 2. so, let us rst assume p 6= 2. claim similarity transformation nondiagonal automorphism seen equivalent diagonal one. convenient rst concentrate rank 2 automorphism h, hij = b c! . b (13) assume ni = 1. case g actually eld. now, choose b = 1 n 0 1!. then, according eq.

(15) 5 thus, need solve equation, + = 0, (16) always solutions p 6= 2. (for p = 2 equal determinant cannot vanish.) say, take = = = = 1. follows h assumed diagonal regular case. prime power, ni > 1, proof same. separate cases = 0 mod p, proof works along lines. omit details brevity. proof actually works rank h. say, h n n matrix. diagonalize hij 6= 0, 6= j, turn, using matrix non-diagonal entry bij. is, fact, similar classical diagonalization symmetric matrices similarity steps elementary algebra. conclude p 6= 2 automorphisms indeed regular thus realized results ref. . p = 2 one step proof fails. second step, assumed = 0 mod p. thus c odd, still equivalent diagonal automorphism. thus left deal cases = c = 0 mod 2. would like know equivalent eld transformation. rank(h) = 2, answer found follows. ni exactly (we assumed ni = nj; due fact ni 6= nj, diagonal automorphisms exist, seen fact elements matrix h must even.) two inequivalent nonregular automorphisms, h = 0 1 1 0! , 2 1 1 2! . (17) automorphism equivalent rst matrix, call type (i), second matrix type (ii). thus, automorphisms diagonal, except two 6 exceptional types. found running mathematica program p = 2n n = 4. subsequent found proved following two theorems: theorem (1): group rank matrices modulo pn p prime, determinant equal 1 mod p, generated following matrices, a12 i,j = i,j + i,1j,2, p 1,a i,j = i,j i,1j,1 i,aj,a + i,1j,a + i,aj,1, generators permutations, b i,j = bi,1j,1 + i,j, b = ps mod pn, = 1, 2, . . . , n 1. here, j label entries matrices. proof theorem outlined below. second theorem theorem (2): rank symmetric matrices 2n, modulo similarity transformation eq. (12), written 22 11 block diagonal form, 2 2 matrices three types mentioned above: diagonal, type (i) type (ii), eq. (17). let us sketch proof two theorems. let mn group rank matrices modulo pn. natural map: h : mn mn1, h(m) modulo pn1. according isomorphism theorems, mn1 mn/g, (18) (19) g = ker(h). g described elements mn equal unit matrix modulo pn1. thus, inductively enogh know g mn1. 7 g group 2m2 elements thus generated matrices ab ij = i,j + pn1a,ib,j, (20) a, b = 1, 2, . . . , i, j denote entries matrix ab. rest mn evidently generated permutations element a1,2. counting orders easily established indeed generators modulo g: aab, 6= b, along with, ab ij = i,j + pbi,aj,a, (21) b = 1, 2, . . . n 2, generators mn1, follows induction n, i.e., generators mn1 modulo g. thus count group elements (pn1 p)m2 = pnm2 = |mn|. finally acting permutations, enough 12 pn1 , arriving theorem (1). proof theorem (2) uses similar ltration. let n rank matrices 2n. assume theorem holds n 1, considering b n modulo 2n1, follows b equal similarity transformation one three classes, modulo 2n1. diagonal classes, need bother theorem proved earlier (it p). say, equal n = 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . mod 2n1, (22) n n addition 2n1 entries. easily eliminated similarity transformations aa,b (for entry (a, b)) b entry (b, b). type (ii) proof same. use theorem (1) establish three types distinct, since used generators. (of course still freely permute rows columns matrix, change result.) 8 it, thus, remains prove therem n = 1. use induction m. say n1,i = 1 mod 2, also ni,1 = 1 mod 2. use two elements clean rst ith rows columns above, except two elements. thus decompose matrix proof follows. amusement reader may wonder theorem (1) works rank 1 matrices, i.e., numbers = 0, 1, 2, . . . , pn 1 modulo pn, 1 modulo p. multiply pn1 + 1 enough times make 0 < < pn1 (this always possible since multiplying like adding pn1). repeat steps inductively. continue might keep multiplying pn1 + 1 higher n compensate fact working modulo higher integer. presents integer modulo pn, 1 mod p, product generators pb + 1, b = 1, 2, . . . n 1. theorem (2) follows that, need worry only, p = 2, rank two, ni = nj. now, let us turn problem realizing nonregular automorphisms, eq. (17). employ following alogarithm. first, eq.
