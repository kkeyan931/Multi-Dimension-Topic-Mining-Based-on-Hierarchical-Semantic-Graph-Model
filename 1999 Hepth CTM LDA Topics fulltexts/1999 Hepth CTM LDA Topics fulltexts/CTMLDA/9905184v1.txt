abstract

we investigate a model for a real scalar eld in bidimensional space-time,
described in terms of a positive semi-denite potential that presents no vac-
uum state. the system presents topological solutions of the bps type, with
energy density that follows a lorentzian law. these bps solutions dier from
the standard tanh-type kink, but they also support bosonic and fermionic
zero modes.

topological defects such as domain walls, strings, monopoles, can appear in models of
symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe [1]. these standard defects appear
in models where the potential presents at least two degenerate vacuum states. for instance,
domain walls require a countable set of vacuum states, in models where one breaks some
discrete symmetry, and cosmic strings and monopoles require uncountable set of vacuum
states, in models where one breaks some continuum symmetry.

despite this standard situation, however, there are other models such as the ones con-
sidered for instance in refs. [2,3], which engender interesting features. for instance, in [2]
one considers the liouville theory to oer a way of breaking spontaneously the tranlation
invariance of the spatial portion of space-time. more recently, in [3] one considers other
forms of systems dened by vacuumless potentials. in the present work we shall be mainly
concerned with the model dened by

with the potential

u() =

we consider  real and positive, and  real. the potential is positive semi-denite, presents
a maximum at  = 0 and no vacuum state. despite the absence of vacuum states, the
system is still able to support topological defects. this model was recently investigated in
[3], and also in [4], and there attention was given mainly on issues concerning gravitational
aspects of the new topological defect. in the present work, however, we shall focus attention
on exposing other features of the system, considering the 1 + 1 dimensional minkowsky
space-time: x0 = x0 = t and x1 = x1 = x. here  is dimensionless, and  has dimension
inverse of distance, dim()=1/dim(x). the eld  is dimensionless, and the system behaves
standardly in bidimensional space-time.

the equation of motion is

and for static  = (x) we get

as shown in ref. [3], this equation is solved by

(x) =

arcsinh(x)

these solutions diverge asymptotically, and their specic forms depend on  and . although
they are somehow similar to the usual tanh-type kink and antikink that appear is the 4
model, they are much more diuse than the standard tanh-type defect, and have divergent
amplitude.

to expose key features of this classical solution, let us consider the energy of static

congurations. here we have

e =

eb is the value that minimizes the energy. it can be written as eb = w , where

w = w [(x  )]  w [(x  )]

it only depends on the asymptotic values of the function

w () =


2 arctan[sinh( )]

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

the procedure here is similar to the case of coupled elds, as considered in refs. [5,6] and
in applications to condensed matter [7] and eld theory itself [8].

the function w () obeys

dw
d

=




sech( )

and the potential in (2) can be written as

u() =

1

d !2
2   dw

(10)

(11)

for static elds the energy is bounded to e = eb for eld congurations that solve the
rst-order equation

d
dx

=




sech( )

(12)

we see that solutions of this rst-order equation also solve the equation of motion. yet, we
can check explicitly that

(x) =

1


arcsinh(x)

(13)

solves the rst-order equation (12). this means that this solution is stable [6] and of the
bps [9] type [8,10]. we return to the issue of stability below, making the argument explicit.
the bps solutions present the interesting feature of allowing the energy to be written

as

eb = z 



dx!2
dx d 

=

2

2 z 



3

dx sech2( )

(14)

the energy density has the form

(x) =

1/2

x2 + 1/2

(15)

interestingly, the energy density of the bps solution obeys a lorentzian law, and accordingly
is more diuse than the standard tanh-type kink. explictly, the tanh-type kink appears when
the potential is

us() =

1
2

2(2  a2)2

(16)

here a is real and positive, and the kink solutions are (x) =  a tanh(ax). the corre-
sponding energy density reads

s(x) =

1
2

2 a2 sech4( a x)

(17)

in spite of this, however, the energy density (x) in (15) is still integrable and gives the
nite value eb =  /2. alternatively, although the classical static solution (x) diverges
asymptotically, the asymptotic values of w () are nite and give a well-dened w . this
fact can be used to expose the topological aspects of the solution. in 1 + 1 dimensions we
can introduce the topological current

j  = w ()

(18)

here we are following the rst work in ref. [7], using w () to dene the current; it makes
the conserved (topological) charge identical to the energy. this procedure of using w () is
in general more appropriate than considering the eld  itself, as it is usually done in the
case of the standard tanh-type solution. this is evident here, since the classical solution
diverges asymptotically and would make the charge (articially) ill-dened if one uses 
to dene the topological current.

to investigate classical or linear stability, or to compute the rst quantum corrections

[11,12] introduced by the bosonic eld (13) we consider

(x, t) = (x) +xn

n(x) cos(wnt)

(19)

we substitute this into the time-dependent equation of motion (3), and consider the case of
small uctuations n(x) about the classical eld (x) to get

 

where

d2

dx2 + v (x)! n(x) = w2

n n(x)

v (x) =

1/2 + 2x2
(x2 + 1/2)2

is the potential of this schrodinger-like equation.

stability of the classical solution (13) implies that wn in eq. (19) should be real. this
makes w2
n  0, and so the schrodinger-like hamiltonian that appears in eq. (20) has to be
positive semi-denite. but this is indeed the case, since we can factorize the hamiltonian in
eq. (20) in a very specic way. to show this explicitly we use the equations (10) and (12)
to write

this equation can be used to introduce the operators

d
dx

dw
d

a =

+ w

  sech( ) tanh( )

(22)

(23)

where w stands for d2w/d2. these operators obey a
h+ = a

a as the hamiltonians

+a+ and h = a

 = a, and can be used to introduce

where

h = 

d2
dx2 + v

v = w 2

  w w

we use the classical solution (13) to write these potentials in the explicit forms

v+(x) =

v(x) =

1/2

(x2 + 1/2)2
1/2 + 2x2
(x2 + 1/2)2

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

the potential v(x) is exactly v (x), the potential that appears in the schrodinger-like
equation (20). we use this result and |n >= n(x) and < n|m >= nm to write

d2
dx2 +

1/2 + 2x2

(x2 + 1/2)2! |n >
(x2 + 1/2)! 

d

where

n(x) =

(28)

(29)

this result shows that w2
it was done in general, for systems of coupled real scalar elds.

n can not be negative. this proof follows the work in ref. [6], where

the schrodinger-like equation (20) has at least one bound state, the bosonic zero mode
that is present due to translational invariance. the normalized eigenfunction 0(x) is given
by

0(x) = q(1/ )
q(x2 + 1/2)

it is not hard to see that there is no other bound state. in this case no meson can be binded
to the soliton, and only scaterring states may appear [11,12].

the lagrangian density (1) can be seen as the bosonic portion of a supersymmetric
theory, and in the extended supersymmetric model the function w = w () plays the role
of the superpotential  see for instance ref. [10]. we can introduce fermions with the usual
yukawa coupling f () . we may consider f () = g  or

f () = g

d2w
d2 = g  sech( ) tanh( )

(31)

the possibility of introducing fermions in a sypersymmetric way requires the coupling (31),
with g = 1 and majorana spinors. in the model with fermions we search for fermionic zero
modes. we consider the more general case where the spinors are dirac spinors. here the
relevant dirac equation is

i 1 d
dx

+ f ()  = 0

(32)

we use  as the upper (+) and lower () components of the dirac spinor , and the
representation i 1  3 to get



d
dx

+ f ()  = 0

(33)

for f () given by eq. (31), for instance, the fermionic zero mode depends on  and g, and
may not exist for specic values of g, as for instance for |g| = 1/2. there are fermionic zero
modes for |g| > 1/2. for g > 1/2 we get

(30)

(34)

(35)

and for g < 1/2 we get

0 = c(, g)vuut 
0 = c(, g)vuut 

1

(x2 + 1/2)!g

(cid:18)0
1(cid:19)

1

(x2 + 1/2)!g

(cid:18)1
0(cid:19)

where c(, g) is the normalization constant, which depends on both  and g. for instance,

c(, g = 1) = q1/  , and in this case the fermionic zero mode very much resembles the

bosonic zero mode (30): this reects the fact that g = 1 are the only two values of g that
allow the supersymmetric extension.
