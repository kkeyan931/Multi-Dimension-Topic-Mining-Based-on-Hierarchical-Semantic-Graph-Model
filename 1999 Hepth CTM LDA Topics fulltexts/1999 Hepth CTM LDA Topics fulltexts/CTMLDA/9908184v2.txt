s-matrix identities in ane toda field theories

abstract

we note that s-matrix/conserved charge identities in ane toda eld theories of the type
recently noted by khastgir can be put on a more systematic footing. this makes use of a result
rst found by ravanini, tateo and valleriani for theories based on the simply-laced lie algebras
(a, d and e) which we extend to the nonsimply-laced case. we also present the generalisation to
nonsimply-laced cases of the observation - for simply-laced situations - that the conserved charges
form components of the eigenvectors of the cartan matrix.

introduction

ane toda eld theory (atft) is a massive scalar eld theory in 1+1 dimensions, with a lagrangian
of the form

l =

the i, j = 1, . . . , r are the simple roots of a rank-r semi-simple lie algebra g, 0 being the ane
root. there exists an atft related to each possible (twisted or untwisted) dynkin diagram; quantum
scattering matrices (s-matrices) were rst found for the simply-laced cases [1, 2, 3], and later for
nonsimply-laced cases [4, 5]. for theories based on nonself-dual algebras, the algebras fall naturally
into dual pairs (b(1)
6 ). the s-matrix for the second
member of each pair is related to that of the rst by the strong/weak coupling duality   4
 . the
simply-laced algebras and a(2)

4 ), and (f (1)

2n1), (c(1)

n+1), (g(1)

4 , e(2)

2 , d(3)

n , a(2)

n , d(2)

2n are self-dual.

in a recent paper, khastgir [10] noted that there existed product identities on elements of these
s-matrices, all evaluated at the same rapidity, associated with sum rules for the conserved charges
of the theory. for example, he noted that in a(1)

r , (c(1)

r , a(2)

r , d(1)

r+1) and (b(1)

2r1) we had

s22() = s11()s13(),

s = q1

s q1

s + q1

s q3
s ,

(2)

where sab() is an element of the s-matrix evaluated at rapidity , and qx
s is the xth conserved charge
at spin s. the above is true for any s, with non-trivial independent conserved charges existing for s
an exponent of the lie algebra. this is a consequence of the fact - rst noted in [2] (see also [12]) -
that the coecients of a fourier series expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the s-matrix provide
solutions to the conserved-charge bootstrap. if we dene

then the linearly independent rows and columns of (k) each satisfy the conserved charge bootstrap,
and so are proportional to the unique vector qk, implying (k)
k. this does allow the possibility
that some of the matrices (k) are zero, making their relationship to the conserved charges trivial,
but we shall see later that this does not happen, at least for generic couplings.

khastgir did not give a general prescription as to how to nd such s-matrix identities, beyond
noting that some can be written down by inspecting the product-form s-matrix. we give such a
prescription, and also expand the list of identities to cases when not all the s-matrices are evaluated
at the same rapidity.

in order to nd these identities, we need to make use of an identity found by ravanini, tateo
and valleriani (rtv) [14] for simply-laced cases, and to generalise it to nonsimply-laced cases. we
establish this fundamental identity in section 2 before using it, in section 3, to generate further
s-matrix identities.

in simply-laced cases, ravanini, tateo and valleriani [14] found

for the minimal s-matrix and gave a general proof based on the geometric formulae of [6]. this
identity also holds for the full s-matrix. here, g is the incidence matrix of the dynkin diagram of
the lie algebra, h is the coxeter number, and  is the step function

there also exist integral formulae for the s-matrix, given by oota [13] and frenkel and reshetikhin
[8]; these can be used to prove rtvs formula but, since they apply to all simple lie algebras, can
also be used to generalise (4) to nonsimply-laced cases.

before we can present ootas formula, we must break o to provide a few denitions. we shall
work with the untwisted algebras here, since the s-matrices for the theories based on twisted algebras
can be found through the duality transformation. (the exceptional case a(2)
2n will be discussed at the
end of this section.) firstly, let h be the dual coxeter number, r be the maximum number of edges
connecting any two vertices of the dynkin diagram, and 0  b  2 be a function of the coupling
constant, conjectured to be [1, 2, 3, 7]

for lie algebra g. next, let the set of simple roots of the lie algebra be {i}, and dene ti = r (i,i)
where the length of the long roots is normalised to 2. finally, dene

where q(t) = exp(cid:16) (2b)t

and reshetikhin [8] is similar to this, but without the factor of (1)ab exp(cid:16)r 

this is 1 for the self-dual cases, and 2 for the nonself-dual ones, except for (g(1)
thus ti = 1 for short roots and ti = r for long roots.

exponential, shows that this factor is 1 for  real, though it is dierent from 1 if  is complex. we
shall use frenkel and reshetikhins form here.

we now propose a generalised rtv identity of the form

sij( + h + tih)sij(  h  tih) = ey

r

yl=1

gil

yn=1

sjl( + (2n  1  gil)h ),

(10)

and aim to nd y. we now need to be careful, particularly for  = 0, as in this case we can either
consider the lhs as

lim

xh+tih

lim
0

sij( + x)sij(  x)

(11)

or with the limits reversed. in the rst case (the one we would choose if we were to go on and use
this in the thermodynamic bethe ansatz approach) it simply becomes the unitarity constraint on s,
and thus is equal to 1. if we take the limits in the other order, then (as can be seen if the s-matrix
is written out in block form) the result becomes -1 if the s-matrix has a pole at h + tih. similar
situations can also arise for the rhs, and in any other case where we have a product s( + x)s(  x)
such that one term is evaluated at a pole of the s-matrix, and the other is at a zero.

following rtv, we will consider the rst case here. we found it simplest to replace h and h
in (10) by h + i and h + i, and take the limit   0 last. substituting in (9) and simplifying, we
nd

ey = lim

that when the integrand in (12) is expanded out, all the terms are of the form t(x, ) = r 

 . looking ahead to section 4 and formula (23), we can see
k eikex|k|,
with x real, which is divergent if x is positive. it is, however, implicit in ootas formulation that
any terms which are navely divergent must be analytically continued. for x negative, t(x, ) is just
another standard fourier transform, which has the result 2i arctan 
x , so, after analytic continuation,
we should set t(x, ) = 2i arctan 

(12)

x for all x.

it is helpful to split the t(x, ) terms into two sets: x  0 in the limit   0 (but non-zero
otherwise) and the rest. it is only for the rst of these that the choice of limit prescription makes a
dierence. taking the  limit rst, they are i, depending on whether x  0, for all , but, with
the limits taken the other way, we get limx0 2i arctan 
x .

if we had chosen to take the  - rather than the  - limit rst, pr

l=1[kil]qqmlj(q(k), q(k)) would
have reduced to ij[tj]q(k). each t(x, ) would then be matched by a t(x, ), so the rhs would
reduce to 1, i.e. y = 0. looking carefully at the above reasoning, we can convert this to a result
about the other limit prescription by adding 2i() to y for each term of the rst type present,
this being the dierence between its value with the  limit taken rst - which we take to be i - and
its value with the  limit taken rst.

if we take rst the term l = i then, looking at the denition (7), t(x, ) terms of the rst type are
only present if mij(q(k), q(k) is of the form q(|k|)2q(|k|)ti1+(terms in more negative powers
of q, q). expanding out equation (23), we nd m is of the form qxqy+ more negative powers for
given x, y, meaning we are searching for the presence of a block {2, ti + 1} in sij(). this is no
surprise, as this is the block responsible for the pole h + tih discussed above; this is just another
way of representing the same situation. case-by-case analysis shows this block is present i gij is
odd.

looking instead at l 6= i, we note that then [kil]qq = [gil]q which, expanding out the denition
of the bracket notation, is qgil1  qgil3  . . .  q(gil1). thus, the only way a q dependence
can enter is if gil > 1. in this case, by an argument similar to the above, we are now searching for

in this context, due to the 2i periodicity of the exponential, we need not worry about how the x  0 limit is

taken.

3

{1, ti} blocks, with ti > 1. proceeding again by case-by-case analysis, we nd that the block {1, 2} is
never present and {1, 3} is only possible in (g(1)
4 ), where it does not occur in the right element
of the s-matrix to invoke this process.

2 , d(3)

to sum up, we nd a single contribution to y for gij odd and none otherwise. this can be restated

as y = 2i()gij, showing that we have indeed found a generalisation of the rtv formula.

to complete this section, we must discuss the exceptional case a(2)

2n . being self-dual, the s-matrix
for this theory cannot be found from the above. following oota, however, we note that the necessary
prescription is to replace each reference to rh by h = h = 2n + 1, take all ta = 1, and replace the
incidence matrix by the generalised incidence matrix [11], which is obtained from the incidence
matrix of a(1)
n by replacing the last zero on the diagonal by a one. doing this, we obtain the correct
integral s-matrix, and hence a generalised rtv identity, for this case.

3 multi-linear identities

the rtv result and its generalisation allow us to perform a simple trick and generate a large number
of s-matrix identities. interchanging i and j in (10) does not change the lhs if ti = tj - the two roots
are the same length - due to the symmetry of the s-matrix, so we can equate the rhs before and after
interchanging to get

r

yl=1

gil

yn=1

sjl( + (2n  1  gil)h) =

r

gjl

yl=1

yn=1

sil( + (2n  1  gjl)h).

(13)

(note that the presence or absence of an exponential factor does not aect this, as ti = tj ensures
gij = gji.) if i and j are such that the corresponding rows of the incidence matrix consist of entries
no greater than 1, this reduces to

sil()glj =

r

yl=1

sjl()gli,

r

yl=1

(14)

and we can obtain identities for products of s-matrix elements, all evaluated at the same rapidity; the
rst example, (2), is one of this set. now, however, we also have identities in which not all rapidities
are equal.

to generalise the connection between s-matrix product identities and conserved charge sum rules

to this case, we can take logarithmic derivatives to nd that if

ya,b{i,j}

sab( + if 1

ab) = ya,b{i,j}

sab( + if 2

ab),

for some sets {i, j} and {i, j} then

xa,b{i,j}

applying this to (13) gives

where it should be noted that the sums over n and n in (13) have been absorbed by the introduction

4 other observations

in the simply-laced cases, the conserved charges can be simply characterised as components of the
eigenvectors of the cartan matrix [11]. taking the logarithmic derivative of the formula (10) and
proceeding as before allows us to generalise this to nonsimply-laced cases, as follows:

r

xl=1

[gil]q(is)ql

s = 2 cos(cid:20)s(cid:18) 2  b

2h

+

bti

2rh(cid:19)(cid:21) qi

s.

(20)

note now, however, that the ti in the cos term stops this from being a proper eigenvalue equation in
the nonsimply-laced cases. in simply-laced cases, this reduces to the known eigenvector result, since
[n]q = n for n = 0, 1 (as all entries of the incidence matrix are in these cases), and we have all ti = 1
and h = rh. rearranging, this can also be stated as

[kil]q(is)q(is)ql

s = 0.

r

xl=1

(21)

we can also nd a relation between the matrix m and the conserved charges. noting that the
s-matrix expression (9) explicitly contains the matrix m , we rst take the logarithmic derivative,
and then note that the resulting integral can be re-expressed as a contour integral over the upper
half-plane. the only poles in this expression are in the matrix m , so, before we can continue, we
must nd a formula for this. if we recall that the s-matrix can be written in a product form [7] as

sab() =

h

rh

yx=1

yy=1

{x, y}mab(x,y)

(22)

(where the {x, y} are standard building blocks, and the mab(x, y)s are integers), and compare with
ootas integral form, we can nd a formula for m as

mab(q, q) =

h

rh

xx=1

xy=1

mab(x, y)

qhxqrhy  q(hx)q(rhy)

qhqrh  qhqrh

.

(23)

this shows that the only poles present are at k = im, m being any integer, so the result is that we
can re-express the integral in the form of a fourier expansion, and thus read o a relation between
(s)
ab and m as

(s)
ab = 2 sin s  sinh sh  sinh sh  m (q(is), q(is)).

(24)

si =

of course, to nd an expression in qa
ab, where si is the ith exponent of a rank-r algebra, we could use qa

s, we need to include a scaling factor. noting thatpr

combining this with the expression for m , we get

(25)

from this, it is straightforward to see that the matrix (s)
ab is non-zero for generic b by simple case-by-
case analysis. (this is dierent from this minimal case where, as noted by klassen and melzer [11],
we can get a zero matrix for s = h
2 in simply-laced cases, even if that exponent is present.) had there
been cases where (s) was zero for some s, then taking the logarithmic derivative of an s-matrix
identity would sometimes have resulted in a trivial conserved charge identity. as it is, however, we
can always derive a non-trivial conserved charge identity from an s-matrix identity and vice versa.

5 conclusions

we have found a generalisation of the rtv identity to nonsimply-laced cases, and, from this, a way of
generating s-matrix identities of the type recently discussed by khastgir. it is still an open question

5

as to whether we have found all such identities, or merely a subset. in addition, we note that we can
always use the technique of taking logarithmic derivatives to generate corresponding identities for
the conserved charges. we have also, in equation (20), generalised the eigenvector characterisation
of the conserved charges in the atfts to the nonsimply-laced cases.

while this note was in preparation, the result (10) was also reported by fring, kor and schulz [9]
as their combined bootstrap identity (we have altered our notation to accord with theirs). they
proceeded by a geometrical argument, and went on to use this to derive the integral formula for the
s-matrix. they chose to take the  limit last, and so their bootstrap identity does not have the factor
e2igij (), but it is otherwise the same. the result that sij() contains the block {2, ti + 1} i gij
is odd, which we found case-by-case, can also be found through a more systematic framework given
by them.
