abstract

we consider n = 1 supersymmetric so(n) gauge theory with a symmetric traceless
tensor. this theory saturates t hooft matching conditions at the origin of the moduli
space. this naively suggests a conning phase, but brodie, cho, and intriligator have
conjectured that the origin of the moduli space is in a non-abelian coulomb phase.
we construct a dual description by the deconnement method, and also show that the
theory indeed has an infrared xed point for certain values of n. this result supports
their argument.

our understanding of the non-perturbative dynamics in supersymmetric (susy)
gauge theories has made remarkable progress during the past several years. in par-
ticular, n = 1 susy gauge theory has rich low energy behaviors e.g.
the runaway
superpotential (no vacuum), some kinds of conning phases, (infrared) free magnetic
phase, non-abelian coulomb phase, (infrared) free electric phases and various applica-
tions to phenomenology e.g. models of dynamical susy breaking, models of composite
quarks and leptons. in this paper, we discuss n = 1 susy so(n) gauge theory with a
symmetric traceless tensor, which is one of the theories with an ane quantum moduli
space classied by dotti and manohar [1], and its low energy behavior has been inves-
tigated by brodie, cho, and intriligator [2]. in order to make our discussion clear, we
briey review the argument of brodie, cho, and intriligator.

tree level superpotential. here u(1)r is an anomaly free global symmetry. the 1-loop
beta function coecient is b0 = 2(n  4),4 so the theory is asymptotically free for
n  5. the classical moduli space is parameterized in terms of the diagonal vacuum
expectation values (vevs) of s, which is of (n  1) complex dimensions.

at the quantum level, the superpotential of the form

therefore, c must vanish. this part of the moduli space is referred to as the higgs
branch.

ant composite operators5

(n = 2,    , n).

the so(n) model is in the conning phase at the origin. however, brodie, cho, and
intriligator have discussed that this conning picture at the origin is misleading because
of the following three arguments.

1. free electric subspaces exist and intersect at the origin. this implies that the
massless spectrum at the origin cannot simply consist of the conning moduli
on.

2. in the presence of the mass term for s, the moduli space must have another
conning branch to be consistent with witten index argument, where the non-
perturbative superpotential is generated, while no superpotential exists on the
higgs branch.

3. a nontrivial phase and branch structure must arise when the original so(n)

model is perturbed with a general tree level superpotential.

from these arguments, they concluded that the so(n) models moduli space origin is
in a non-abelian coulomb phase. if this is the case, it is natural to ask whether the
dual description exists. however, explicit dual description has not yet been found so
far. the purpose of this paper is to construct the dual description of so(n) model
and show that it has a nontrivial infrared xed point.

let us recall the deconnement method introduced by berkooz [3] in order to
construct the dual description of the so(n) gauge theory with a symmetric, traceless
tensor. this method has been applied to the theories in which a two-index tensor eld
is included, and no tree level superpotential exists. according to this method, the new
strong gauge dynamics is introduced, and the two-index tensor eld is regarded as a
composite eld (meson) by the strong gauge dynamics, namely,

xab  gfafb.

(3)

here x denotes a composite supereld, f is an elementary supereld charged under
both the original gauge group and the new strong gauge group, and g is an invariant
metric of the strong gauge group. greek letters are indices of the new strong gauge
group, while roman letters are those of the original gauge group. for instance, the
symmetric tensor, the antisymmetric tensor, the adjoint representation of su gauge
group correspond to mesons of the strong so, sp, su gauge group, respectively. the
advantage of this method is that a deconned theory has only dening representa-
tions, therefore one can use a well-known duality to derive a new duality.

we apply here this method to the symmetric traceless tensor of so(n) gauge group.
note that a symmetric tensor of so(n) is not irreducible, so there always appears a
singlet under so(n), which is a trace part of the symmetric tensor.

the matter content and symmetry of the deconned theory is given in table 2.

the tree level superpotential is

table 2: the eld content of the deconned theory

so(n + 5) gauge theory with (n + 1) avors has a branch in which the dynamically
generated superpotential vanishes [4],

wdyn = 0.

(5)

one can easily verify that the above deconned theory is reduced to the original theory
at the low energy. consider the case so(n )  so(n +5), where so(n ),so(n +5) is the
dynamical scale of so(n), so(n + 5) gauge theory, respectively. we know that
so(n + 5) gauge theory with (n + 1) avors is conning [4], and the eective elds
are mesons y2, yz, z2. as can be seen in the superpotential, yz, p, z2, s become massive
at so(n +5). after integrating them out, we see that only y2 is massless and the
superpotential vanishes. thus, the original theory is recovered6.

taking a dual of so(n) gauge theory with (n+6) avors [4], we obtain the following
theory given in table 3. here the elds in parentheses stand for the elementary so(10)

(y2) in deconned theory denotes a composite meson, (y2) in the dual denotes a gauge

symmetric tensor, so we add its mass term to the superpotential

singlet,

(10)

and integrates it out. then, the low energy eective theory becomes so(n) gauge
theory with a symmetric traceless tensor, which we would like to consider. this defor-
mation corresponds to

in the dual description. using the equation of motion for (y2)singlet

y4 + (p2)p2 + (y2)y2.

(13)

now, let us check the consistency of the duality. the t hooft anomaly matching
conditions are trivially satised since we use the deconned method which guarantees
the anomaly matching. the mapping of the gauge invariant operators which describes
the moduli space is also trivial as depicted in table 5. this mapping is consistent with
the global symmetry u(1)r.

next, we consider various at direction deformations. first, consider the direction

hy2i 6= 0, namely,

hyi =

,

(14)

y1

. . .

. . .

yn









where hyi is a (n + 5)  n matrix and yi(i = 1,    , n) are constants. to simplify
the analysis, let us suppose that y1 6= 0 and yi(i = 2,    , n) = 0. in the deconned
theory, the following symmetry breaking occur

so(n) + (n + 6)
so(n + 5) + (n + 1)

 so(n  1) + (n + 5)
 so(n + 4) + n .

,

(15)
(16)

since one component of z and p become massive from the coupling in the superpotential,
integrating them out by the equations of motion, we obtain the eective superpotential

we = y zp + z2s + m(y 2

singlet)2.

(17)

y , z and p are transformed as y (
so(n + 4). on the other hand, the corresponding direction in the dual is

along this direction, the symmetry breaking goes as follows

(18)

(19)
(20)

since one component of y becomes massive due to the coupling in the superpotential,
integrating them out, we obtain the eective superpotential

 1) under so(10) 
the elds with dash are transformed as y (
so(n + 4). the above result is consistent simply because n is replaced by n  1.
in fact, taking a dual of so(n  1) + (n + 5)
in the deconned theory, we obtain
so(n 1)so(n + 4) as the dual gauge group. we will arrive at the following theory
as in table 6. the dual superpotential is

w = (y p)z + z2s + (y 2)y 2 + (y p)y  p + (p2)p2 + m(y 2)2

singlet.

(22)

integrating the massive elds (y p), z and (y 2)singlet by using their equations of motion,
one can obtain the same superpotential as that in eq. (21).

it is straightforward to extend the above result to the more general case where the

vev of y takes the form as

y1

hyi =

(l = 1,    , n).

(23)

in this case, the symmetry breaking is

so(n) + (n + 6)
so(n + 5) + (n + 1)

 so(n  l) + (n + 6  l)
,
 so(n + 5  l) + (n + 1  l)

,

(24)
(25)

and l components of z and p become massive, so after integrating them out, we nd
the eective superpotential of the form

w = y zp + z2s + m(y 2)2

singlet.

(26)

the representations of y , z and p under so(n l)so(n +5l) are y ( ,

 so(10) + (n + 6  l)

(28)
(29)

since l components of y are massive, after integrating them out, we can nd the eective
dual superpotential of the form

we = y 2 p2s + (y 2)y 2 + (p2)p2.

(30)

this result is also consistent. one can easily show explicitly that taking a dual of
so(n  l) + (n + 6  l)
in the deconned theory, one obtains the same deformed
dual theory as seen in the above simple case.

next, we consider the other at direction deformations hpi 6= 0. in the deconned

theory, the following symmetry breaking occur:

so(n) + (n + 6)
so(n + 5) + (n + 1)

 so(n  1) + (n + 5)
 so(n + 5) + (n  1)

table 8: the deformed dual theory for hpi

this resulting theory is also consistent under the deformation along hpi 6= 0. in fact,
taking a dual of so(n  1) + (n + 5)
[4] and integrating out the massive modes,
we can easily derive the dual in table 8 and the superpotential (34).

furthermore, we can check the consistency under the mass term deformation.
adding the mass term w = 1
2 mp2 to the superpotential in the deconned theory,
and integrating out p, we can derive the eective theory: so(n) gauge theory with
(n + 5) vectors and so(n + 5) gauge theory with (n + 1) vectors and a singlet s. the
eective superpotential takes the form

we = 

1
2m (yz)2 + z2s + m(y2)2

singlet.

(35)

on the dual side, this deformation corresponds to adding the term  w = 1
2 m(p2) to
the dual superpotential. the equation of motion for (p2) forces p to develop a vev.
this leads to break so(10) to so(9), then we arrive at the following eective theories:
so(9) gauge theory with (n +5) vectors and so(n +5) gauge theory with a symmetric
tensor and 10 vectors and a singlet s, a gauge singlet meson (y2). the eective dual
superpotential becomes

) under so(9)  so(n + 5), which
where y0 stands for a eld transformed as (1,
should be identied with the eld z in the deconned theory. by rescaling the elds
appropriately, one can see that the above result is consistent.

although we have constructed the dual description for so(n) susy gauge theory
with a symmetric traceless tensor by deconnement technique, it is not so trivial to
see that the theory under consideration has a non-trivial infrared xed point at the
origin of the moduli space since the gauge groups are products. following ternings
argument [5], we would like to show explicitly that the theory has indeed the infrared
xed point.

we note that one can analyze the theory for an arbitrary ratio of the two dynamical
scales 1, 2 thanks to holomorphy [6], where 1, 2 are the scales of so(10) gauge
theory with (n + 6) avors, so(n + 5) gauge theory with a symmetric traceless tensor
and ten vector avors, respectively. furthermore, there is no phase transition when the

8

ratio is varied. there are three cases to be considered. for n < 4, so(n + 5) theory
is asymptotically non-free and so(10) theory is asymptotically free. this implies
1  2 and if we renormalize the gauge coupling of so(n + 5) theory g at the scale
1, then g(  1)  1. for 4 < n  18, so(n + 5) theory becomes asymptotic free
and the limit 1  2 corresponds to weak coupling of so(n + 5) theory. for n > 18,
so(10) becomes asymptotically non-free, which implies 1  2 and g(  1)  1.
for n = 4, since the gauge coupling g does not run, we can take an arbitrary small
coupling. in any cases, the gauge coupling g  0 as the ratio 1/2  0 or , so we
can perform the perturbative analysis for g.

let us rst consider the zero-th order case in g, i.e. so(n + 5) dynamics is turned
o. the dimensions of the gauge invariant operators have to satisfy the following
constraints to be in unitary representations of the superconformal algebra [7]:

d(y2) = 2 + 2y(g = 0)  1,
d(y p) = 2 + y(g = 0) + p(g = 0)  1,
d(y10) = 10 + 10y(g = 0)  1,
d(y p9) = 10 + 9y(g = 0) + p(g = 0)  1,
d((y2)) = 1 + (y2)(g = 0)  1,

(37)

where  is the anomalous dimension of the eld , and the bound is saturated for free
elds. we note that the rst term in the dual superpotential (13) is a product of three
gauge invariant operators. thus, these are irrelevant because they can be relevant only
if the dimensions of these gauge invariants are one, which means that these operators
are free. the elds s interacts only through the rst term which is irrelevant, so these
are free elds and their anomalous dimensions vanish. therefore the equalities (37)
cannot be saturated.

in order to obtain more relations among the anomalous dimensions, we use the

exact  function for the so(10) coupling g1 [8]

(g1) = 

g3

and at the xed point

,

(38)

0 = 18  n + (n + 5)y(g = 0) + p(g = 0).

(39)

the second and the last term in eq. (13) are relevant operators with r-charge 2 for
g = 0, so the following conditions have to be satised,

d(y4) = 4 + 4y(g = 0) = 3,

d((y2)y2) = 3 + (y2)(g = 0) + 2y(g = 0) = 3.

(40)

on the other hand, y2, p2 and s are gauge invariant operators for arbitrary g, and the
corresponding constraint for the dimensions are

d(y2) = 2 + 2y(g)  1,

9

d(p2) = 2 + 2p(g)  1,
d(s) = 2 + 2s(g)  1.

the second and the fourth inequalities of (37) and the rst one of (40) lead to

p(g = 0) > 

3
4

,

(41)

(42)

therefore one can derive the bound for n using the conditions (39), the rst inequality
of (40) and (42):

n >

.

(43)

64
5

the above result implies that so(10) theory has an infrared xed point if n is in the
range of (43). next, we would like to show that so(n + 5) theory also has an infrared
xed point.

the exact beta function for g is

(g) = 

g3

3(n + 3)  10(1  y(g))  (n + 7)(1  (y2)(g))

(44)

where we assume that y and (y2) can be expanded in g perturbatively as follows

y = 

(y2) =

n + 4

+ o(g4),

g2
82
g2
82 (n + 5) + o(g4).

(45)

(46)

if the 1-loop beta function coecient is negative but the 2-loop one is positive, then
the infrared xed point will exist [9]:

0 = (2n  8)  10y(g = 0)  (n + 7)(y2)(g = 0) < 0

 n >

,

1 = 5n + 20 + n 2 + 12n + 35  (2n 2  2n  24)

(47)

10(n + 3)y(g = 0)  (n 2 + 10n + 21)(y2)(g = 0) > 0

 3  n  14,

where 0, 1 denote 1- or 2-loop beta function coecients. taking into account the
conditions (43), (47), we nd n = 13, 14.

in summary, we have discussed a n = 1 susy so(n) gauge theory with a sym-
metric traceless tensor. this theory saturates t hooft matching conditions among
the fundamental elds and the gauge invariant composites at the origin of the mod-
uli space. this naively suggests a conning phase but brodie, cho, and intriligator
have conjectured that the origin of the moduli space is in a non-abelian coulomb
phase. if this is the case, it is natural to ask whether the dual description exists. in

10

this paper, we have constructed its dual by the deconnement technique. since this
approach leads to the product gauge groups, it is not so trivial that the theory has
a non-trivial infrared xed point. following [5], we have shown that the theory has
indeed a non-trivial xed point at the origin of the moduli space for n = 13, 14. thus,
this result supports the argument of brodie, cho, and intriligator. of course, the dual
description is not necessarily unique, we may be able to nd other dualities by further
explorations.

we hope this work will provide a useful guide to analyzing the theory where t

hooft anomaly matching appears to be coincidental.
