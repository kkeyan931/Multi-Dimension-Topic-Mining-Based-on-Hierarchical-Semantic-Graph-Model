abstract

recently we have presented in [1] an ansatz which allows us to construct skyrmion elds
from the harmonic maps of s 2 to cp n 1. in this paper we examine this construction in
detail and use it to construct, in an explicit form, new static spherically symmetric solutions
of the su (n ) skyrme models. we also discuss some properties of these solutions.

introduction

the skyrme model presents an opportunity to understand nuclear physics as a low energy
limit of quantum chromodynamics (qcd). the model was initially proposed as a theory
of strong interactions of hadrons [2], but recently, it was shown to be the low energy limit
of qcd in the large nc limit [3]. since then further work has suggested that topologically
nontrivial solutions of this model, known as skyrmions, can be identied with classical
ground states of light nuclei. however, a thorough understanding of the structure and dy-
namics of multi-skyrmion congurations is required before a more qualitative assessment
of the validity of this application of the model can be made.

the su(n) skyrme model involves elds which take values in su(n); ie are described
by su(n) valued functions of ~x and t. its static solutions correspond to eld congu-
rations describing multi-skyrmions. in this paper new solutions have been obtained for
elds whose energy density is spherically symmetric.

multi-skyrmions are stationary points (maxima or saddle points) of the static energy

functional, which is given in topological charge units by

we have, for simplicity, set the mass terms to zero. this has been done for convenience,
since the conventional mass terms introduce only small changes and, as we will see later,
aect only the prole functions. therefore, all our discussion can be easily generalised to
include such mass terms.

finiteness of the energy functional requires that u(~x) approaches a constant matrix
at spatial innity, which can be chosen to be the identity matrix by a global su(n)
transformation. so, without any loss of generality, we can impose the following boundary
condition on u: u  i as |~x|  .

since u  i as |~x|   is a mapping from s3  su(n), it can be classied by the
third homotopy group 3(su(n))  z or, equivalently, by the integer valued winding
number

which is a topological invariant. this winding number classies the solitonic sectors in
the model, and as skyrme has argued [2], b(u) may be identied with the baryon number
of the eld conguration.

up to now most of the studies involving the skyrme model have concentrated on the
su(2) version of the model and its embeddings into su(n). the simplest nontrivial
classical solution involves a single skyrmion (b = 1) and has already been discussed by
skyrme [2]. the energy density of this solution is radially symmetric and, as a result,
using the so-called hedgehog ansatz one can reduce (2) to an ordinary dierential equation,
which then has to be solved numerically. many solutions with b > 1 of the su(2) model
have also been computed numerically and, in all cases, the solutions are very symmetrical
(cf. battye et al. [4] and references therein). however, since the model is not integrable,
with few exceptions, explicit solutions (even) for spherical symmetric su(n) skyrmions
are not known.

the rst example of a non-embedded solution for a higher group was the so(3) soliton,
corresponding to a bound system of two skyrmions, which was found by balachandran
[6]. another solution, with a large su(3) strangeness content, was found by
et al.
kopeliovich et al.
[7]. however, all other known multi-skyrmion congurations seem to
be the embeddings of the solutions of the su(2) model.

recently, we have showed in [1] how to construct low energy states of the su(n)
model by using cp n 1 harmonic maps. our discussion involved only one projector. in
this paper, we extend our method to more projectors. we show that, for the su(n) model,
when we take n  1 projectors which lead to spherically symmetric energy densities, the
full equations of the model separate and the problem of nding exact solutions is reduced
to having to solve n 1 coupled nonlinear odes for n 1 prole functions. this way we
obtain a whole family of new spherical symmetric multi-baryon solutions of the su(n)
models. our solutions include the su(3) dibaryon conguration of balachandran et al.
[6] and the non-topological su(3) four baryon conguration of [1].

2 harmonic maps

[5] to su(n). this general-
in [1] we generalised the su(2) ansatz of houghton et al.
isation involved re-writing the expression of houghton et al. as a projector from s2 to
cp n 1. it gave us a new way of interpreting old results and of deriving expressions for
the low energy su(n) eld congurations which are not simple embeddings of su(2)
elds. in particular, the energy distributions exhibit very dierent symmetries from those
of the embeddings. the method also gave us a new solution of the su(3) model, which
lies in the topologically trivial sector of the model (ie it has zero baryon number) and so,
obviously, is not stable.

the method of [1] can be generalised further, to involve more projectors. in fact, we
can exploit here some ideas taken from the theory of harmonic maps of s2  cp n 1
[8, 9]; since they play an important role in our construction.

recall (cf.

[9]) that in n-dimensional space there is a natural set of projectors:

s2  cp n 1 maps, which are constructed as follows:

write each projector p as

p (v ) =

v  v 

|v |2

,

(4)

where v is a n-component complex vector of two variables  and  which locally parametrise
s2. in terms of the more familiar  and , they are given by  = tan(/2) ei. the rst
projector is obtained by taking v = f (), ie an analytic vector of ; while the other
projectors are obtained from the original v by dierentiation and gramm-schmidt or-
if we dene an operator p+ by its action on any vector v  cn [9]
thogonalisation.
as

p+v = v  v

v v
|v|2 ,

(5)

then the further vectors p k

+v can be dened by induction: p k

+v = p+(p k1

+ v).

therefore, in general, we can consider projectors pk of the form (4) corresponding to

the family of vectors v  vk = p k

+f (for f = f ()) as

pk = p (p k

+f ),

k = 0, . . . , n  1,

(6)

where, due to the orthogonality of the projectors, we have pn 1

k=0 pk = 1.

the orthogonality properties of our projectors follow from the following properties of

vectors p k

+f which hold when f is holomorphic:

(p k

+f ) p l

+f = 0,

(cid:16)p k

+f(cid:17) = p k1

+ f

k 6= l,

+f |2

+ f |2

,

+ f

  p k1

+ f |2! =

|p k1

(8)

p k

|p k1
+ f |2

.

note that, for su(n), the last projector pn 1 in the sequence corresponds to an anti-
analytic vector; (ie the components of vn 1 = p n 1
f , up to an irrelevant overall factor
which cancels in the projector, are functions of only ).

+

our new su(n) generalisation of [1] involves the introduction of n  1 projectors, ie

u = exp{ig0(p0 

i

) + ig1(p1 

)  . . . + ign 2(pn 2

)}

(9)

where gk = gk(r), for k = 0, . . . , n  2, are the prole functions and ak = eigk  1.
note that the projector pn 1 is not included in the above formula since it is the linear
combination of the others.
[our previous ansatz given in [1] corresponds to putting all
the prole functions, but the rst one, equal to zero.]

the spherically symmetric maps into cp n 1 are given by

f = (f0, f1, . . . , fn 1)t, where

fk = kqc n 1

k+1 ,

(10)

where c n 1
the modulus of the corresponding vector p k

k+1 denote the binomial coecients. furthermore, as we prove in the appendix,

+f for f of the above form is

where  depends on n and k.

(11)

3 constructing the skyrmion solutions

in this section we construct a family of exact spherical symmetric solutions of the su(n)
skyrme models. in fact, we show that for each su(n) model the skyrme eld involving
n  1 projectors leads to an exact solution involving n  1 prole functions.

us with derivatives of

so the factors (1 + ||2)4 in (20) cancel  leaving us with a sum of dierences of two
successive projectors multiplied by functions dependent only on r.

following the above argument and using the properties of rr, etc one can show that
i=1 si (1 + ||2)2(pi  pi1), where
si are functions of gk(r) and their derivatives  leaving us, once again, with a sum of
dierences of two successive projectors multiplied by functions dependent only on r.

the terms [rr, [r, rr]]  in (20), are proportional to pn 1

i=1 (pi  pi1)hi,
where hi are only functions of gk; while the commutators in (17) are equal to a sum of
projectors mutlipied by (1 + ||2)2, which cancel out in (20). in addition, r(r2rr) =

finally, the contribution of the terms (1 + ||2) r  is given by pn 1
i=0 (cid:16)pi  i
we note that, for our choice of the vectors vk, all the dependence on  and  in (20)
resides only in the projectors (the rest of it cancels out). the terms involving r(r2rr)
give us expressions involving 1
n pi while all the other terms give us expressions involving
pi  pi1. although n projectors arise in (20), the projector pn 1 can be re-expressed
in terms of the previous ones  giving n  1 factors involving the harmonic maps pi  1
n
(for i = 0, ...n  2). to satisfy (20) the coecients of such factors have to vanish leaving
us with n  1 equations for the n  1 prole functions gi. hence, if these equations have
solutions then they correspond to exact solutions of the su(n) skyrme models. notice
that (10) implies that these solutions have a covariant axial symmetry, ie any rotation by
an angle  around the z-axis is equivalent to the gauge transformation u  aua where
a = diag(1, ei, e2i, ..e(n 1)i). on the other hand, as will be shown below, the energy
density for these solution is radially symmetric.

the n  1 equations for the prole functions can be obtained either from (20)  which
is a hard task; or from the variation of the energy (1)  using (9) and integrating out 
and  variables. clearly, the two methods give the same equations.

let us stress that our procedure hinges on having n  1 prole functions and on the
very special form of our vectors vk. had we taken other vectors vk, we would have got
some  and  dependence outside the projectors; while had we taken less than n  1
prole functions and projectors we would have got too many equations for our functions.
it is only in the case of n  1 projectors that we get the right number of equations.

3.2 energy dependence on prole functions

these equations can be solved numerically by imposing the appropriate boundary condi-
tions on the prole functions. to do this we have to specialise to a particular model, ie
for specic n and diagonalise the terms involving the second derivatives. the simplest
cases: n = 2, n = 3 and n = 4 involve 1, 2 or 3 functions and will be discussed in the
next sections.

4 topological properties and symmetries

before we discuss special cases, let us rst investigate the general topological properties
of our elds.

7

the topological charge (3), which in many applications of the skyrme model is iden-

tied with the baryon number, is given by

b =

1

82 z dr dd  tr (cid:16)rr [r , r](cid:17) ,

(32)

when written in the complex coordinates.

due to (21) and (13) the terms involving gi/n in rr after taking the trace cancel and

the expression for the baryon number simplies to

b =

fi (1  cos fi)(i + 1)(n  i  1)

xi=0
(i + 1)(n  i  1) (fi  sin fi)r=
r=0 .

(33)

as gi() = 0 (required for the niteness of the energy) the only contributions to the
topological charge come from fi(0).

the n  1 equations for the prole functions and their dierences given in (31) have
many symmetries. these symmetries can be used to derive special skyrmion solutions
which involve a smaller number of prole functions and projectors.

the main symmetry of our expressions, are the independent interchanges

fk  fn k2,

for

k = 0,    , n  2.

(34)

this symmetry follows from the fact the terms dk = k(n  k)(1  cos fk1) which appear
in the energy are symmetric under the interchange: dk  dn k when fk1  fn k1.
in addition, all the other terms in the energy also exhibit this symmetry since they are
combinations of fi and their derivatives.

5 spherical skyrmions

the simplest case corresponds to the su(2) spherically symmetric skyrmion. this is the
solution which was found thirty years ago by skyrme and is usually presented in terms of
the well-known hedgehog ansatz.

5.1 su(3) skyrme model

in this case n = 3 and we have two functions: f0 and f1. the energy density e, such

that e = (6)1r er2dr, is given by

e =

( f 2

and the equations for the prole functions are

f0(cid:18)1+
f1(cid:18)1+

2r2 (1cos f1)(cid:19) +

these equations can be solved numerically when the right boundary conditions have been
imposed.

however, by letting f0 = f1 = f (ie using the symmetry) they reduce to

(37)

this equation coincides with the equation for the prole function of a single su(2)
skyrmion. here we note that as f0(0) = f1(0) = 2 the topological charge of our solution
is four. thus the energy of this conguration, which corresponds to four skyrmions is
eb=4 = 4  1.232, ie is exactly four times the energy of one skyrmion. we see that we
have a static solution corresponding to four non-interacting skyrmions, placed on top of
each other in such a way that their energy density is spherically symmetric.

in addition, there is a further symmetry which allows us to set f0 = f1 = g. in this

case the equations reduce to

# = 0.

(38)

let us note that, since f0 = g0  g1 and f1 = g1, this case corresponds to g0 = 0 and thus,
the eld (9) involves only one projector, namely p1. this solution is the topologically
trivial solution discussed in [1] and its energy is 3.861.

finally, balachandran et al. skyrmion solution can be obtained from (36) by imposing
the following boundary conditions: g0(0) = 2, g1(0) = 0 and g0() = 0, g1() = 0; its
energy is eb=2 = 2.3764.

these equations have the previously mentioned symmetry fk  fn k2 which allows us
to set f0 = f2 by keeping f1 arbitrary.

in addition, letting f0 = f1 = f2 = f the above system reduces to equation (37) and
therefore, the conguration which consists of ten skyrmions (as b = 3f0(0)+4f1(0)+3f2(0)
=
10) is eb=10 = 10  1.232, ie is exactly ten times the energy of one skyrmion. once again
we have a solution describing many skyrmions, which are non-interacting and whose
energy density is spherically symmetric.

in addition, letting f0 = f2 = g we spot that when f1 = 0, we have a solution of

the form

which corresponds to a non-topological solution, ie its baryon number is zero; however
the corresponding conguration consists of three skyrmions and three anti-skyrmions.
[recall, that the prole functions are g0 = 0 and g1 = g2, ie the eld (9) involves only one
projector of rank two  namely p1 + p2.]

in general, however, the solutions depend on more functions. we can always assume
that the functions fi go to zero at innity, so the topological charge of a solution is
determined, using (33), by the boundary value of each fi at the origin. when each of
these values is positive the solution is a mixture of skyrmions. when some fis take
positive and some fis take negative values at the origin the solution corresponds to a
mixture of skyrmions and anti-skyrmions. this is very similar to what happens in the
two-dimensional grasmannian sigma model [8].

we have solved numerically equations (40) taking all combinations, modulo the ex-
change of f0 and f2, of 0, 2 and 2 for the value of fi at the origin. the results are
summarised in the table below.

the rst ve solutions are bound states of skyrmions with energies larger than the
energies of the corresponding su(2) solutions [4]. moreover, the excitation energy of the

10

rst two solutions is very small. as mentioned above, the energy of the b = 10 solution is
exactly ten times the energy of a single skyrmion solution. these solutions are all axially
symmetric (but their energy densities are radially symmetric) and thus they are all more
symmetrical than the corresponding su(2) solutions.

the last four solutions are bound states of skyrmions and anti-skyrmions. although

their energies are very small, we know that these solutions must be unstable.

6 conclusions

in this paper we have shown how to construct radially symmetric solutions of the su(n)
skyrme models. in the general case these solutions depend on n  1 prole functions
which have to be determined numerically. in some cases we can exploit symmetries of
our expressions and reduce the number of functions. thus in the case of su(3) we can
recover the topologically trivial solution discussed in [1].

we have not discussed the derived solutions in much detail. their properties and their
relation to physics deserve further study and these topics are currently under investigation.

it is worth pointing out that there is a rather close connection between su(n) bps
monopoles and skyrmions. both monopole and skyrmion elds can be constructed in
terms of harmonic maps between riemann spheres. thus, recently, it has been shown
[10] that the monopoles elds can also be constructed using the projector ansatz.
its
generalisation to multi-projectors and the construction in [10] provide explicit examples
of spherically symmetric su(n) monopoles with various symmetry breaking patterns. in
the monopole case, the bogomolny equation is the analogue of our skyrme equation and
the monopole number corresponds to our baryon number.

appendix

in this appendix we prove equation (11) for f given by (10). this result can be proved by
induction. note that, the modulus of the n-dimensional vector f is |f |2 = (1 + ||2)n 1
and therefore, |p+f |2|f |2 = |f |2|+f |2  |f +f |2 = (n  1)(1 + ||2)n 3|f |2, therefore,
|p+f |2 = (n  1)(1 + ||2)n 3.

using (8) we get

which nally, leads to

+f |2 +

therefore if |p k

|p k+1

+ f |2 =  (1 + ||2)n 2k3,

(a.6)

where  = (n  2k  1) + 2/. to nd  we again use induction, recalling that the
coecients of the two lowest terms in the sequence are 1 and n  1, respectively. then
it is easily seen that

|p k

+f |2 = k!(n  1)(n  2)    (n  k)(1 + ||2)n 2k1,

(a.7)

in which the last term in the sequence corresponds to k = n  1.
