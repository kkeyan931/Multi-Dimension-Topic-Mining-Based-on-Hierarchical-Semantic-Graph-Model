abstract

the equivalence between the chern-simons gauge theory on a three-
dimensional manifold with boundary and the wznw model on the bound-
ary is established in a simple and general way using the brst symmetry.
our approach is based on restoring gauge invariance of the chern-simons
theory in the presence of a boundary. this gives a correspondence to the
wznw model that does not require solving any constraints, xing the
gauge or specifying boundary conditions.

in a seminal paper [1] on the 2+1 dimensional yang-mills theory with an action
consisting purely of a chern-simons term (chern-simons gauge theory), witten
showed that the chern-simons theory on a compact surface was intimately connected
with two-dimensional conformal eld theory and more precisely to wznw models
with compact groups. the connection was stated in the somewhat abstract form
that the physical hilbert spaces obtained by quantization in 2+1 dimensions can be
interpreted as the spaces of conformal blocks in 1+1 dimensions. a more concrete
connection was also suggested by considering the chern-simons theory on a manifold
with boundary. this connection was further elaborated in [3] and [2], generalizing
the connection to gauged wznw models with compact groups. although the treat-
ment in [1]-[3] for a manifold with boundary is explicit it is not entirely satisfactory
for several reasons. firstly, the action on a manifold with boundary is not gauge
invariant. a gauge transformation yields boundary terms. this implies that upon
quantization there is no symmetry that restricts possible quantum corrections. how-
ever, the fact that the gauge invariance is broken at the boundary is precisely what is
used in [2] & [3] to show that chern-simons action reduces to a chiral wznw action
in a particular partial gauge. thus, it seems that connection between the chern-
simons theory and the wznw model can only be made if gauge invariance is broken
at the boundary and for a particular partial gauge. related to this is the fact that
in making the connection to the wznw model one does not encounter the standard
chiral wznw hamiltonian, but in fact one that is zero [2]. this is a consequence
of the way the connection is made by solving the constraints. it really means that
we still have an action not suitable for quantization since it is still not gauge xed.
secondly, as there is no gauge invariance on the boundary, one may even classically
modify the chern-simons action with boundary terms. dierent boundary terms will
yield dierent boundary actions and dierent actions for the conformal eld theory.
an argument due to regge and teitelboim [4] may be invoked as a guiding principle
for possible boundary terms. for our particular example this is done in [5].

these objections to the explicit correspondence should be contrasted to the gen-
eral connection involving the hilbert space of the 2+1 dimensional theory and confor-
mal blocks mentioned above. although formulated for the case of a compact manifold
without boundary and for a compact group, it does not refer to any particular gauge
or any particular choice of boundary condition. it is natural to ask whether or not a
more explicit formulation exists, which still is general with no reference to a partic-
ular gauge or choice of boundary condition. the objective of the present work is to
provide such a formulation. we will see that the correspondence may be formulated

1

in terms of a brst symmetry. invariance with respect to the brst transforma-
tions will imply that the two theories - chern-simons and wznw - are equivalent.
particular forms of the action may then be found by dierent choices of the brst
invariant gauge xing terms.

recently, the interest in the chern-simons theory has grown substantially due
to the work of maldacena [6] on the correspondence between string theory on anti-
desitter spaces and certain conformally invariant theories associated with the bound-
ary. this correspondence was formulated as the so-called holographic principle [7].
as our work here deals with a special (and simple) case of the holographic principle it
may be of some interest that there exist a simple and elegant way to implement this
principle. however, due to the simplicity of the model with no propagating degrees
of freedom in the bulk, it is not clear that this may be of use for a more non-trivial
example.

the motivation of our work does not primarily come from ads/cft correspon-
dence in itself, but rather from our desire to understand the calculations of the en-
tropy of the 2+1 dimensional black hole presented in [8]. in particular, we wanted to
understand the problem of choice of boundary terms in connection with the btz [9]
black hole. our results in connection with this problem will be presented elsewhere
[10].

we start by briey recalling the correspondence between chern-simons theory
on a manifold with boundary and wznw models as formulated in [1]-[3]. the
chern-simons action is3

a  a  a).

(1)

the action is invariant under the gauge transformation a = d + [a, ] if  has no
boundary. if  has a boundary the variation yields a boundary term

ics = 

k

t r(da).

(2)

the invariance of the action may be achieved by requiring  = 0 on the boundary.
this is equivalent to saying that the full gauge group g is reduced to all gauge
transformations g1, that are one on the boundary. the variation of a0 yields a
constraint (i, j = 1, 2)

a = ijfaij  0, a = 1, . . . n.

(3)

3we have for convenience excluded a factor of 1/(2).

2

this constraint implies that the vector eld is pure gauge i.e. ai = iu u 1, for
some map u :   g. the gauge invariance implies that we have an equivalence
relation u  v u for any v that is one on the boundary. this implies that only the
restriction of u to the boundary is relevant. if we use ai = iu u 1, i = 1, 2, and
x the gauge partially by a0 = 0, the chern-simons action reduces to

ics = 

k

t r(u 1du u 1du u 1du )(cid:19) . (4)

here we have chosen  = d, a disc of radius r with a radial coordinate x1 = r
and an angular coordinate x2 = . we will for convenience make this choice for the
remaining part of the paper. as remarked above, the hamiltonian corresponding to
this action is easily checked to be zero. furthermore, the action corresponds to a
chiral wznw action, where the current j(z) in the conventional form of the wznw
theory here is identied with a = u u 1, as can be seen from the form of the
action (4). the dirac brackets of these currents give that the current satises an
ane lie algebras of level k [12]. if we add to the action boundary terms e.g. a
term  k
ai = iu u 1 leads to modications of (4) by boundary terms, which in turn
implies that the resulting action is not the conventional chiral wznw action. a
boundary term of this form (for a particular c ) was e.g. suggested in [8] for the
btz black hole.

as the appearance of the boundary terms involving the delta function (x1  r) may
seem surprising and is important in what follows, we will explain the calculation in
a little more detail. in computing the pb one needs to use certain delta-function

3

identities. these identities may be derived using test functions, that are usually
assumed to be zero on the boundary, then the constraint algebra may be shown to
close. the extra terms on the right hand side of eq.(6) appear if one generalizes the
delta-function identities to hold on test functions that are arbitrary on the boundary.
4 an alternative way of computing the pb is to introduce a complete set of functions
on d and then by using the pb of the modes with respect to this set, the pb can be
computed yielding the same result.

the appearance of the extra terms in eq.(7) implies that the constraints are not
rst class i.e. gauge invariance is broken by boundary terms. this is of course
connected to the fact that the action is not gauge invariant due to boundary contri-
butions. it implies that a gauge may not be xed on all of d. the breaking of gauge
invariance occurs only at the boundary. if x, x are interior points, then the extra
terms in eq.(7) are zero and the constraints are rst class. thus, we have a phase
space version of the statement above that the gauge group g reduces to g1.

in the careful computation of eq.(7) lies also the hint on how to proceed.

it
is well-known that second class constraints may be converted into rst class con-
straints by adding new degrees of freedom, whereby restoring the gauge symmetry
of the theory. this will be the strategy in the following. firstly one notices that

this hamiltonian is automatically gauge invariant even at the boundary. notice
that gauge invariance forces a modication of the chern-simons action by a unique
boundary term in the vector elds. let us pause and comment on the constraints

4the practical way of making all computations here and below is in fact to use  =

rd d2x(a(x)a(x)) for some l1 functions on d and compute {,  }. in [15] and [16] boundary

corrections for poisson brackets in general are discussed.

of the new theory. these are given by 
a  0. examining eq.(9) we see that these
constraints consist of two pieces, a bulk and a boundary part. the boundary part
enters much like a source term. for any point in the interior of d we simply have
the original constraints ijfaij  0. if we consider eld congurations ai
a that are
continuous and have continuos spatial derivatives at the boundary, then they will also
satisfy ijfaij  0 on d. in this case the constraint implies that aa2() =  2
k ja()
on d. thus, we recover the connection between wznw currents and a2 mentioned
above in the original formulation. for eld congurations that are not smooth at
the boundary this relation does not hold. it is not clear to us what the implications
of this generalization mean.

a simple counting of the degrees of freedom shows that the additional degrees of
freedom associated with the currents ja, which are n phase space degrees of freedom
at every space point on the boundary, compensates exactly that the n constraints
are transformed from second class to rst class constraints on the boundary. let us
now show in more detail that the theory dened by this hamiltonian is equivalent
to the chern-simons theory dened by the action (1) and a specic boundary term
added to it. first we impose the partial gauge aa
0  0. then hcs = h   0 so that
the resulting actions are identical. it remains to show that we can break the gauge
invariance by imposing gauge xing constraints on the boundary that eliminate the
new degrees of freedom. we consider a gauge constraint ja()(x1  r)  0. to see
that this xes the gauge at the boundary consider

{zd

(r, )
 

(11)

(r, ) = 0, from which we conclude that the gauge
equating this to zero, we nd  
is xed at the boundary apart from the zero mode part of 
a. neglecting this detail
for the moment, the gauge xing constraint eliminates the wznw current degrees
a  0 to a  0, which are second class on the
of freedom reducing the constraints 
boundary. thus we are back to the original chern-simons theory (with a specic
boundary term). let us now comment on the zero mode part. the gauge xing

of the zero mode part r dja() = 0 is not a valid gauge choice. we may notice

that in fact the zero mode part of the constraints 
a = 0 satisfy a closed algebra.
thus, we have really introduced slightly more degrees of freedom than necessary.
this may be changed by subtracting the -independent part of ja from 
a. then
the -independent part of aa
2 will play the role of the zero mode of the current. in
the following we will for simplicity not concern ourself with this subtlety and leave


a unaltered.

we have already seen that our theory reduces to the chern-simons theory for
a particular choice of partial gauge. we will now show that for another choice of
gauge we may eliminate the vector eld degrees of freedom leaving us with only the
wznw degrees of freedom, thus establishing classically the equivalence of the two
theories. imposing the gauge constraints aa
1  0, it is easily checked that this
xes the gauge both in the interior of d and at its boundary. this eliminates all
vector eld degrees of freedom (as aa
1). the dirac bracket is,
therefore, only non-zero for brackets containing the wznw degrees of freedom and,
therefore, we have found the promised reduction. possible forms for the hamiltonian
will be discussed below.

2 is conjugate to aa

0 = aa

we have established the connection between the chern-simons theory and the
chiral wznw model by imposing dierent gauges. a more fundamental way of
manifesting the equivalence is to introduce a brst charge. as the constraints are
rst class this is straightforward using the bfv formalism [13], [14]. we have

  rd d2x[ k

rd d[( k

(12)

we note that the brst charge consists of two distinct parts. in the rst line we
have a bulk part and in the second a boundary part. the ghosts ca, ba and their
momenta ba, ca satisfy the usual pb. it is easily checked that {, } = 0. a brst
invariant hamiltonian may now be constructed in the standard way

htot = {, }

for some gauge fermion . we will now discuss some possible choices of .

the rst term is precisely the sugawara hamiltonian (for an appropriate choice of
). the second term is a ghost correction at the boundary. the third term is a bulk
hamiltonian. since the degrees of freedom are completely eliminated in the bulk,
this term will not contribute to any dirac brackets. in fact, we may set this term to
zero and still have a brst invariant hamiltonian.

other choices of gauge fermions are of course possible e.g. one which makes the
0 dynamical. we will, however, not discuss this further.

lagrange multiplier eld aa
instead let us end with some concluding remarks.

we have demonstrated the classical equivalence between the chern-simons gauge
theory and the chiral wznw model. it should be emphasized that the equivalence
between the bulk and boundary theories follows without any specications of gauge
or boundary conditions.
it is the gauge invariance or more generally the brst
invariance that makes the dierent choices of hamiltonian physically equivalent.
the quantum equivalence is ensured once the nilpotency of the brst operator is
established and non-trivial brst invariant states are found. thus, for this particular
example one may state that the holographic principle is translated into a statement
about brst symmetry.

our considerations have for simplicity been for the disc, but they may easily be
generalized to other cases. then the delta function (x1  r) is replaced by a gener-

alized delta function (x  ), which is dened by r[f (x)(x  )] = r f (x).

note also that it is irrelevant where the boundary actually is i.e. we have the freedom
to move it at will. this is a freedom that follows from our formulation as it does
not rely on any particular boundary conditions. for the case of the black hole it

7

will imply that the calculation of the entropy will be (almost) independent of where
we actually put the boundary. we can choose the horizon, but just as well another
surface. we will discuss this in more detail in [10].
