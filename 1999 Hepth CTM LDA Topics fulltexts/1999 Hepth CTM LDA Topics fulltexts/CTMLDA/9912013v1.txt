abstract

for spaces which are not asymptotically anti-de sitter where the asymptotic behav-

ior is deformed by replacing the cosmological constant by a dilaton scalar potential, we

show that it is possible to have well-dened boundary stress-energy tensors and nite

euclidean actions by adding appropriate surface counterterms. we illustrate the method

by the examples of domain-wall black holes in gauged supergravities, three-dimensional

dilaton black holes and topological dilaton black holes in four dimensions. we calculate

the boundary stress-energy tensor and euclidean action of these black congurations and

discuss their thermodynamics. we nd new features of topological black hole thermody-

namics.

1 introduction

in the traditional euclidean path integration approach to black hole thermodynam-

ics [1, 2], except for the usual gibbons-hawking surface term which makes the variation

principle well dened, one has to choose a suitable reference background and make sub-

traction in order to get a nite euclidean action of black holes. however, the background

subtraction procedure makes the action of black holes depend on the choice of reference

background. furthermore sometimes one may encounter the situations in which there

are no appropriate reference backgrounds, as observed for the taub-nut-ads and taub-

bolt-ads spaces [3, 4]. on the other hand, in the quasilocal formulation of gravity [5, 6],

one can dene the so-called quasilocal stress-energy tensor and conserved charges on the

boundary of a given spacetime region. unfortunately, such quantities often diverge as the

boundary is taken to innity. a suitable background subtraction must then be made for

getting a nite result.

in the asymptotically anti-de sitter spacetimes, the above diculty has been solved

recently. the proposal is that by adding suitable surface counterterms to the gravitational

action, one can obtain a well-dened boundary stress-energy tensor and a nite euclidean

action for the black hole spacetimes [7]. a remarkable feature of this procedure is that

the boundary stress-energy tensor and euclidean action thus dened are independent of

the reference background and the results are physically unique. recently a lot of works

have been devoted to this proposal and related topics [8]-[21].
in (n + 1)-dimensional
einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant  = n(n 1)/2l2, the action can
be written as

s =

(1.1)

where the rst term is called the bulk action, and the second term is just the gibbons-
hawking surface term. here h denotes the reduced metric of a timelike boundary m
and k represents the trace of its extrinsic curvature to be dened below. in ref. [9], an

expression of surface counterterms has been given, which can cancel divergences up to

(1.2)
where r and rab are the ricci scalar and ricci tensor for the boundary metric hab. the
authors of [20] claimed that they have given the surface counterterms up to n  8. from
(1.2), one may see that the cosmological constant l plays a crucial role in this surface

counterterm method. once given the surface counterterms, one may dene a quasilocal

stress-energy tensor by

(1.3)

where the extrinsic curvature is kab =  1

decomposing the boundary metric hab in the adm form with a spacelike surface b in

m with metric ij:

(1.5)

associated with a killing vector a, where ua is a timelike unit normal to b. in this way
one can have the denition of the mass of gravitational eld as [7]

dn1xnbuaubtab.

m = zb

(1.6)

using the above prescription, balasubramanian and kraus [7] have obtained the boundary

stress tensor associated with a gravitational system in asymptotically anti-de sitter space.

via the ads/cft correspondence [22, 23, 24], the result is interpreted as the expectation

value of the stress tensor of the boundary quantum conformal eld theory. in particular,

they have found a nonvanishing ground state energy for a global ads5, and have matched
this energy with the casimir energy of the dual n =4 super yang-mills theory on r s3.
so far, however, most of these works are restricted to the asymptotically anti-de sitter

space and its asymptotically at limit. it is true that these two kinds of spacetimes are

3

much of physical interest, but there are also other interesting spacetimes which are neither

asymptotically anti-de sitter nor asymptotically at. for instance, the geometry in the

decoupling limit of the black d3-brane with ns b eld [25, 26] has been proposed as
the gravity dual of the n =4 super yang-mills theory in non-commutative spacetime. it
is thus interesting to try to extend this approach to a more general class of spacetimes.

in this paper we consider the kind of spacetimes which are not asymptotically anti-de

sitter, in which the asymptotically anti-de sitter behavior is deformed by the presence

of a dilaton potential in the bulk action. in this class of spacetimes, we nd that it is

also possible to have a well-dened boundary stress-energy tensor and a nite euclidean

action by slightly modifying the above prescription. we give a general form of the surface

counterterms necessary to cancel the divergences and provide a formula for the coecient

in terms of the asymptotic behaviors of the metrics and potential in the solution.

the organization of this paper is as follows.

in the next section we rst consider

domain-wall spacetimes in gauged supergravities which come from the sphere reduction

of dp-branes in type ii supergravities, since in this case we can have a consistency check

of our result. we will also consider a kind of charged domain-wall spacetimes. our

results can be regarded as a part of the realization of the so-called domain wall/qft

correspondence. in sec. 3 we will discuss a three-dimensional dilaton black hole, where

the btz black hole is deformed by a dilaton potential. in sec. 4 we extend this discussion

to the topological dilaton black holes in four dimensions. a brief summary is given

in sec. 5. the general formula for the surface counterterms and their coecients are

summarized in the appendix.

2 domain-wall black holes

the ads/cft correspondence asserts that there is an equivalence between the bulk super-

gravity (string/m theories) and a boundary conformal eld theory. this correspondence

nicely illustrates the holographic principle [27, 28] which is widely believed to be a feature

of any consistent theory of quantum gravity. thus the ads/cft correspondence is just

a special case of a more general correspondence between supergravity and quantum eld

theory (qft) in one lower dimensions. on the basis of the observation that the ads

4

metric in horoshperical coordinates is a special case of a domain-wall metric, boonstra,

skenderis, and townsend [29] have extended the ads/cft correspondence to the so-

called domain-wall/qft correspondence between the gauged supergravity and quantum

eld theory on domain walls. this correspondence has been discussed further in ref. [30]

in various dimensions. it is straightforward to extend this to the correspondence between

the domain-wall black holes and corresponding quantum eld theory at nite tempera-

ture. in this section we will extract the stress-energy tensor of quantum eld theory on

the domain-walls in the spirit of domain-wall/qft correspondence. we rst discuss the

case, in which the domain-wall black holes come from sphere reduction of dp-branes in

the dual frame. we will then consider the charged domain-wall black holes which come

from singular sphere reductions of eleven-dimensional supergravity and ten-dimensional

type iib supergravity.

2.1 neutral domain-wall black holes

let us consider the black dp-brane solution with magnetic charge in type ii supergrav-

ity. in the string frame, the action is

s =

(2.1)

where g10 = 864 is the gravitational constant in ten dimensions. the black dp-brane

solution is

ds2

e = gsh (3p)/4,

p) + h 1/2(f 1dr2 + r2d2

f8p = q8p,

where gs is the string coupling constant, 8p the volume form of s8p and

(2.2)

(2.3)

in the decoupling limit:   0, but keeping xed u = r/, u0 = r0/ and the t hooft
coupling constant g2

ym = gs()(p3)/2, the harmonic function tends to

ymn, with g2

h = 1 +

g2

()2u 7p = g2

ymn()2u p7,

(2.4)

where we have absorbed an unimportant coecient into gym [29]. except for the case of

p = 3, the radius of angle part of the string metric (2.2) depends on u and the metric is

singular at u = 0 even in the case of u0 = 0. to circumvent this problem, the so-called

dual frame metric has been considered in [29]:

ds2

dual = (ne)2/(p7)ds2

string.

(2.5)

in this frame, the action (2.1) becomes

s =

the decoupling limit solution in the dual frame is

f8p = (7  p)n()(7p)/28p,

e =

(2.7)

(2.8)

where f = 1  (u0/u)7p. the near-horizon dual frame metric is adsp+2  s8p for
p 6= 5 and e(1,6)  s3 for p = 5. an important feature of this frame is that the radius of
the angle part of the metric becomes a constant.

because  is eventually canceled at the end of the calculations, we set  = 1 in what

follows. in addition, by the transformation (p 6= 5)

u2 = 2(cid:16)g2

ymn(cid:17)1

u 5p,  = 2/(5  p),

the above dual frame metric can be put in a standard form

ds2

dual =

(u/)(p7)(p3)/2(p5),

f8p = (7  p)n8p.

(2.9)

(2.10)

it was found that the scale u introduced above is just the holographic energy scale of the

boundary qft. thus the dual frame was argued as the holographic frame describing

supergravity probes [29].

6

due to the fact that the radius of angle part of the metric is a constant, one may con-

sistently reduce the angle part to get an eective gauged (p + 2)-dimensional supergravity.

in the einstein frame, the resulting action is

(2.12)

in the eective gauged supergravity action, its equations of motion have the following

domain-wall black hole solutions:

(2.13)

where , and e are given in eqs. (2.7), (2.9) and (2.10), respectively, and u0 is dened
as u2

now we are interested in extracting the stress-energy tensor of quantum eld which

lives in the domain wall (2.13), according to the domain-wall/qft correspondence. we

nd that the scalar potential occurring in the action (2.11) can play the same role as a

cosmological constant does in the asymptotically anti-de sitter spaces. writing the scalar

potential v () as

v () 

n(n  1)

l2

one may introduce an eective cosmological constant 1/le dened by

according to the formulae (a.3), (a.7) and (a.9) in the appendix, by adding the following

surface counterterm to (2.11):

(2.16)

it is possible to cancel divergences in physical quantities such as stress-energy tensor and

euclidean action associated with the domain-wall black holes. note that the surface term

is similar to the rst term in (1.2) but with dierent coecient.

the surface metric ab of the spacetime, in which the boundary quantum eld lives,

can be obtained as [8]

ab = lim

(2.20)

which means that the boundary quantum eld theory lives in a at domain wall. the

stress-energy tensor of boundary quantum eld theory can be obtained as [8]

substituting (2.18) into the above formula, we nally arrive at

(2.24)

(2.25)

where t is the hawking temperature of the domain-wall black hole (2.13). for p < 5,

the free energy is negative, which implies that the system is thermodynamically stable,

while for p > 5, the free energy becomes positive. in this case, the thermal excitations are

thermodynamically unstable, and they will be suppressed in canonical ensemble. from

(2.13) it might appear that the results derived above are applicable only to p < 5. in
fact, the above results hold for p  5 as well, for we may use the coordinate u in (2.8)
instead of u in (2.13) and then the same results are obtained (the apparent singularities

for p = 5 as in eqs. (2.18) are absent in terms of u and u0). we also see from (2.22) and

(2.25) that the case of p = 5 is a bit peculiar: the free energy and the pressure of thermal

excitations on the domain wall vanish.

2.2 a consistency check

note that the domain-wall black hole solution (2.13) comes from the sphere reduction

of dp-brane solution (2.2).

it makes possible to calculate the stress-energy tensor of

boundary quantum eld theory and the free energy directly from the dp-brane solution

9

(2.2) and to compare with the results from the counterterm method. the formula to

extract the stress-energy tensor of excitations of dp-branes has been given in [8]:

(2.26)

where ni is a radial unit in the transverse subspace, while h = g is the deviation of
the (einstein frame) metric from that for at space. the labels a, b = 0, 1,   , p run over
the world-volume directions, while i, j = 1, 2,   , 9  p denote the transverse directions.
in addition, it should be reminded that the calculations in (2.26) must be done using

asymptotically cartesian coordinates.

rewriting the dp-brane solution (2.2) in the isotropic coordinates of the einstein

frame, we have

ds2

e = h (7p)/8(f dt2 + dx2

p) + h (p+1)/8r22(d2 + 2d2

where  is the radial coordinate having the relation with r as

2.3 charged domain-wall black holes

it is now clear that one can make consistent reductions of eleven-dimensional supergravity

on s4 or s7, and ten-dimensional type iib supergravity on s5. the kaluza-klein sphere

reduction results in gauged supergravities. the anti-de sitter spaces are vacuum solutions

of these gauged supergravity. more recently an evidence has been provided that some

singular limits of sphere reduction are also consistent and resulting gauged supergravities

have domain-wall vacuum solutions, instead of the ads spaces [31].

the so-called domain-wall supergravities can be consistently truncated to the following

bosonic lagrangian [31]:

s =

b2ea(cid:21) ,

(2.37)

11

where a2 = 2/p, b is a constant and f denotes the maxwell eld strength. the action
(2.37) for p = 5 comes from the reduction on s3  r of eleven-dimensional supergravity,
while p = 2 from the reduction on s3  r4 and p = 3 from the s3  r2 reduction of type
iib supergravity. but we consider an arbitrary p in what follows.

the equations of motion from the action (2.37) have domain-wall black hole solutions

where m and q represent two integration constants. choosing the surface counterterm as

its pressure vanishes identically. this is reminiscent of the case of the p = 5 neutral

we nd that the euclidean action i vanishes identically. this is again the same as the

case of p = 5 neutral domain-wall black holes. here it should be reminded that the

calculation (2.44) has been done implicitly in grand canonical ensemble, in which the

electric potential of the charge of black holes is xed at the boundary. the vanishing of
the euclidean action in grand canonical ensemble means that the gibbs free energy g = 0
for the charged domain-wall black holes.

3 three-dimensional dilaton black holes

the three-dimensional btz black hole plays an important role in understanding statistical

entropy of black holes. the degrees of freedom of the btz black hole can be accounted

for by a two-dimensional boundary conformal eld theory, which is a special case of the

ads/cft correspondence. in this section we consider a deformed btz black hole by a

dilaton eld and an exponential potential. its action is

when n = 2, the solution reduces to the btz black hole. in addition, note that the

radial coordinate r is chosen to be dimensionless and  is a length scale with dimension

of length. (this should not be confused with the inverse hawking temperature 1/t . in

this paper we do not use  for the inverse hawking temperature.)

hence we have the free energy of the solution

(3.4)

(3.5)

for 2 > n > 1, the free energy is always negative and the dilaton black hole is thermo-

dynamically stable as the btz black hole. for 1 > n > 2/3, however, the free energy

becomes positive and the dilaton black hole is thermodynamically unstable.

obviously the dilaton black hole solution (3.2) is not asymptotically anti-de sitter,

unless n = 2.

in what follows we will extract the boundary stress-energy tensor and

its quantum expectation value of the corresponding boundary quantum eld, by adding

an appropriate surface counterterm to the action (3.1). as in the previous section, the

occurrence of the dilaton potential makes possible to choose a suitable surface counterterm

as

(3.7)

(3.8)

which means that the mass of the black hole from the counterterm method is the same

as the quasilocal mass identied at the spatial innity. note that the latter is obtained

by using background subtraction method [5, 6].

the surface metric is derived as

rn habdxadxb = c2dt2 + 2d2.

(3.9)

can be calculated as in the previous examples and we get

yields a nite result

(3.12)

which gives us the same free energy as (3.5). the example of the three-dimensional dilaton

black hole shows that the surface counterterm method works well as in the case of domain-

wall black holes. we expect that this method is also applicable to other three-dimensional

black holes with a nonvanishing scalar eld.

4 topological dilaton black holes

recently it has been found that in the asymptotically anti-de sitter spaces, except for

the black holes whose horizon hypersurface has the topology of positive curvature sphere,

there are other black hole solutions with horizon hypersurfaces of zero or negative constant

curvature. the latter are called topological black holes. these topological black holes

have been studied extensively in the ads/cft correspondence (for example, see [13] and

references therein). in this section, we consider those topological black holes in dilaton

gravities. that is, as in the case of three-dimensional dilaton black holes, the negative

cosmological constant is replaced by a dilaton potential, which changes drastically the

asymptotic behavior of black hole solutions.

the action we will consider is

s =

1

16g z d4xghr  2()2 + 2e2b  e2aff i 

1

8g z d3xhk, (4.1)

where a and b are two constants. assuming the solution has the following metric:

ds2 = a(r)dt2 + a1(r)dr2 + r2(r)d2
k,

(4.2)

15

where d2
k is the line element of a two-dimensional hypersurface with constant curvature
2k. without loss of the generality, we may set k = 1, 0 and 1, respectively. when
k = 1, the hypersurface  has a positive constant curvature. this is the case of spherically

symmetric black holes. the horizon surface is of the topology of two-sphere s2. when

k = 0, the hypersurface  is a ricci at surface. in this case, we may have the two-torus
topology t 2, or its innite area limit r2, or a cylinder topology s1  r. finally when
k = 1,  is a hyperbolic hypersurface. by an appropriate identication, in this case,
one may get an arbitrary higher genus hypersurface. in the asymptotically anti-de sitter

spaces, black holes with these three horizon hypersurfaces exist. now we discuss these

so-called topological black holes in the dilaton gravity described by (4.1). because of the

dilaton potential, we will see that the topological dilaton black holes will not approach

asymptotically the anti-de sitter space. let us consider the case k = 0 rst.

4.1 k = 0 solutions

in the case of k = 0, we have the black hole solutions [34, 35]:

(4.3)

where 0 is an integration constant, q is the charge of the hole and m is the quasilocal

mass identied at spatial innity. n and  are two parameters and v is the area of the

hypersurface . in order for the solution (4.3) to have a black hole structure, it must be

satised that  > 0 and 1/4 < n < 1 [34].

for the solution (4.3), the results in the appendix tell us that the suitable surface

counterterm is

c0 = 2s 3n

ttt =

(4.5)

where c2

1 = e2b0/n(4n  1). according to the mass formula (1.6), the mass of the black

hole is

m = zr

d2xr2a1/2ttt = m,

(4.6)

where  is the determinant of the metric of the hypersurface . the mass is the same

as the quasilocal mass at the spatial innity. the surface metric, in which the boundary

quantum eld lives, is

ab = lim

r2 hab =  2c2

(4.7)

using (2.21), we then obtain the boundary stress-energy tensor of the corresponding

after a straightforward calculation using the counterterm (4.4), we are able to get a nite

(4.9)

where r+ is the horizon of the black hole, which satises the equation a(r+) = 0. the

gibbs free energy (4.9) is consistent with the denition

g = m  t s  q,

(4.10)

where t and s are the hawking temperature and entropy of black holes, and  is the

chemical potential corresponding to the charge. for the solution (4.3), we have

17

it is easy to verify that (4.10) reproduces the result (4.9). because of 1/4 < n < 1, we see

from (4.9) that the free energy is always negative for 1/2 < n < 1, but changes its sign

at n = 1/2, becoming positive for 1/4 < n < 1/2. in the latter case, the black hole is

thermodynamically unstable. note that in the einstein [36] and einstein-maxwell [37, 12]

gravities with a negative cosmological constant, the black holes with k = 0 are always

thermodynamically stable. therefore the change of asymptotic behavior of black hole

solutions may change the thermodynamic stability. it is worth pointing out here that the

sign change of the gibbs free energy does not mean the occurrence of the hawking-page

phase transition [38, 39] as in the einstein gravity, because once given a black hole, the

value n is xed and then the sign of the free energy is xed as well and will not change

due to the change of the size of black holes.

4.2

k = 1 solutions

in this case, we consider the following black hole solution [34]:

(4.12)

where we use the same notations as in the previous subsection and in particular r and

ftr are the same. to have a black hole structure, we must have 0 < n < 1/2.

for the hyperbolic black hole (4.12), we nd that the appropriate surface counterterm

is

sct =

the quasilocal stress-energy tensor then is

(4.13)

(4.14)

unfortunately, the black hole solution (4.12) has no well-dened surface metric ab in this

case and the other components of the quasilocal stress-energy tensor are not well dened,

18

either. nonetheless, as a consistency check of the surface counterterm (4.13), we may

compute the mass of the black hole using (1.6). once again, in this way, the mass of the

black hole is found to coincide with the quasilocal mass m at the spatial innity:

m = zr

d2xr2a1/2ttt = m.

(4.15)

note that due to the dierent asymptotic behavior, the so-called negative mass black

holes [36, 37, 13] do not appear in this dilaton gravity. the euclidean action of the hole

is

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

from (4.17) we see that the rst term is negative, while the second is positive. therefore

the gibbs free energy may be negative for large black holes, while positive for small black

holes, which is reminiscent of the schwarzschild-anti-de sitter black holes [38, 39], where

the free energy is also negative for large black holes and positive for small black holes.

therefore the hawking-page phase transition takes place for the hyperbolic black holes
(4.12), which occurs at g = 0, that is, at r = r+ with

r2
+ =

1  2n

n

162q2e2a0

v 22

.

(4.20)

from the free energy (4.17) and the critical point (4.20), one may see that the charge

plays a central role in the hawking-page phase transition: if q = 0, the phase transition

19

will disappear. it would be interesting to note that the hawking-page phase transition

does not appear in the hyperbolic black holes of the einstein and einstein-maxwell ads

gravities [36, 37, 13]. in addition, as a consistency check, one may reproduce the gibbs

free energy (4.17) by the denition (4.10) with the same expressions in (4.11) of black

hole entropy s and the chemical potential .

4.3

k = 1 solutions

of course, the action (4.1) has also spherically symmetric black hole solutions. three

sets of black hole solutions have been given in [40]. we consider here the rst set of the

solutions found there:

(4.22)

(4.23)

a well-dened surface metric ab requires a2 = 1, but which is excluded by the existence
of black hole solutions from (4.21). just as the case of k = 1, we cannot obtain a
well-dened stress-energy tensor of the corresponding quantum eld here. instead we can

20

calculate the mass of the black hole as before. the result is again in agreement with the

quasilocal mass m identied at the spatial innity,

m = zr

dd sin2 r2a1/2ttt = m.

(4.24)

the euclidean action of the black hole in the grand canonical ensemble is found to be

and r+ is the horizon radius satisfying the equation

it can be seen clearly from (4.25) that the free energy is negative for small black holes,

while it becomes positive for large black holes, which changes its sign at

r2
+ = (1  a2)

q2e2a0

2

.

(4.28)

thus the small black holes are thermodynamically stable and large black holes will become

thermodynamically unstable. this property is the same as that of the rn black holes in

asymptotically at spaces. as is well known, the heat capacity is positive for near-extremal

rn black holes (small r+) and becomes negative beyond a certain critical point (r+

gets larger) from extremal rn black holes. this thermodynamic behavior is completely

opposite to that of the black holes in the anti-de sitter spaces [38]. therefore although

an eective negative cosmological constant occurs here, the thermodynamic properties

are similar to those of rn black holes in asymptotically at spaces. furthermore, we can

check that the gibbs free energy (4.25) is reproduced by the denition with the black

hole entropy s and the chemical potential :

in addition, it is worth noting that because the solution (4.21) has a well-dened asymp-
totically at limit as a  0, the surface counterterm (4.22) has also a well-dened asymp-
in this limit, we again reproduce the thermodynamics of rn and
totically at limit.

5 conclusions

in the dilaton gravities with a dilaton potential, in general, the black hole solutions do not

approach asymptotically anti-de sitter spaces due to the dilaton eld, but we have found

that for such black holes, it is also possible to extract a well-dened surface stress-energy

tensor and to get nite euclidean action by adding appropriate surface counterterms to

the bulk action, in which the dilaton potential plays a similar role as the cosmological

constant does in the einstein(-maxwell) gravity. in this paper using this prescription we

studied some examples including domain-wall black holes in gauged supergravities, three-

dimensional dilaton black holes and topological dilaton black holes in four dimensions. in

these examples, this prescription works well.

using the surface counterterm method, we have also obtained boundary stress-energy

tensors and euclidean actions of domain-wall black holes. these results have been checked

to be consistent with those coming from direct calculations in the original dp-brane

congurations of type ii supergravity. for a kind of charged domain-wall black holes

in the domain-wall gauged supergravities, which result from singular limit of the sphere

reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity and ten-dimensional type iib supergravity,

we have found that the gibbs free energy and the pressure of the thermal excitations on

the domain-wall always vanish. this is the same as the situation for the d5-brane case.

we have also studied thermodynamics of these black congurations by calculating

euclidean action within this surface counterterm method. some new features have been

found in the topological dilaton black holes, which are not present in the einstein(-

maxwell) gravities with a negative cosmological constant. for example, k = 0 dilaton

black holes may be thermodynamically unstable; in the hyperbolic charged dilaton black
holes (k = 1), the hawking-page phase transition may take place; in the case of k = 1
we have a well-dened asymptotically at limit of the surface counterterm. using it, we

can reproduce the thermodynamics of schwarzschild and rn black holes.

a formula for surface counterterm

here we present our formula for the surface counterterm, which is applicable to all our

cases.

let us write our metric as

ds2 = a(r)dt2 + b(r)dr2 + c(r)dx2
p,

(a.1)

where the last term represents a p-dimensional ricci-at space, and the eective cosmo-

logical constant le is dened as

1
le

= vuut

v ()

p(p + 1)

,

(a.2)

in the einstein frame. by analogy with the surface counterterms in eq. (1.2), we introduce

the counterterm

 2z dp+1xh

c0
le

,

(a.3)

where only the relative normalization with the einstein term is written explicitly.

in

fact, we nd that appropriate choice of the coecient removes divergences from physical

quantities. the asymptotic behaviors of the metrics b, c and v govern the coecient c0,

whose formula is derived below.

let the asymptotic behaviors of the elds be

a(r) = a0r + . . . ,

b(r) = b0r + . . . ,

c(r) = c0r + . . . ,

v () = v0r + . . . .

(a.4)

it can be easily checked that in order to satisfy the einstein equations, one must have

 +  = 2.

(a.6)

where prime indicates dierentiation with respect to r. this leading behavior governs the

niteness of the physical quantities. note that thanks to the relation (a.5), the two terms

in eq. (a.6) match with each other and allows to cancel the divergences.

imposing the condition that the leading terms be absent in eq. (a.6), we obtain the

formula

c0 =

.

in fact, for the asymptotically ads space
