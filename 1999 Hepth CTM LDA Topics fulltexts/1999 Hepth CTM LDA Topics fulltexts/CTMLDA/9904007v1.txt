abstract

we consider non-perturbative six and four dimensional n = 1 space-time
supersymmetric orientifolds. some states in such compactications arise in
twisted open string sectors which lack world-sheet description in terms of
d-branes. using type i-heterotic duality we are able to obtain the massless
spectra for some of such orientifolds. the four dimensional compactica-
tion we discus in this context is an example of a chiral n = 1 supersymmetric
string vacuum which is non-perturbative in both orientifold and heterotic pic-
tures. in particular, it contains both d9- and d5-branes plus non-perturbative
twisted open string sector states as well.

i. introduction

in recent years substantial progress has been made in understanding orientifold compact-
ications. various six dimensional orientifold vacua were constructed, for instance, in [14].
generalizations of these constructions to four dimensional orientifold vacua have also been
discussed in detail in [510]. in many cases the world-sheet approach to orientifolds is ade-
quate and gives rise to consistent anomaly free vacua in six and four dimensions. however,
it was pointed out in [10] that there are cases where the perturbative orientifold description
misses certain non-perturbative sectors which are nonetheless present and must be taken
into account. in certain cases this inadequacy results in obvious inconsistencies such as lack
of tadpole and anomaly cancellation. examples of such cases were discussed in [810]. in
other cases, however, the issue is more subtle as the non-perturbative states arise in anomaly
free combinations, so that they are easier to miss.

in certain four dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric cases type i-heterotic duality enables
one to argue along the lines of [11,7,10] that the non-perturbative states become heavy
and decouple once the corresponding orbifold singularities are appropriately blown up. in
particular, these are the z3 [6,11], z7, z3  z3 and z6 [7], z2  z2  z3 [12], and (3  32)
(the latter is non-abelian) [13] orbifold cases. as was argued in [10], the same, however,
does not seem to be the case for other tadpole free orientifolds such as the z2  z6, z3  z6
and z6  z6 [8], and z12 orbifold cases. the purpose of this paper is to understand non-
perturbative states in such orientifold compactications. in particular, in some cases we are
able to obtain the massless states arising in such sectors.

the origin of non-perturbative states in orientifold compactications can already be
understood in six dimensions. thus, in the k3 orbifold examples of [3] the orientifold
projection is not , which we will use to denote that in the smooth k3 case, but rather
j , where j  maps the g twisted sector to its conjugate g1 twisted sector (assuming
g2 6= 1) [14]. geometrically this can be viewed as a permutation of two p1s associated with
each xed point of the orbifold [10]. (more precisely, these p1s correspond to the orbifold
blow-ups.) this is dierent from the orientifold projection in the smooth case where (after
blowing up) the orientifold projection does not permute the two p1s. in the case of the j 
projection the twisted open string sectors corresponding to the orientifold elements j g
are absent [15,10]. however, if the orientifold projection is , then the twisted open string
sectors corresponding to the orientifold elements g are present. in fact, these states are
non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint and are required for gravitational anomaly
cancellation in six dimensions. as we will see, in certain cases type i-heterotic duality will
allow us to understand such sectors.

in four dimensional orientifolds with n = 1 supersymmetry there are always sectors
(except in the z2  z2 model of [5] which is completely perturbative from the orientifold
viewpoint) such that there is only one p1 per xed point, so only the  orientifold projection
is allowed. this results in non-perturbative twisted open string sectors, which, as we have
already mentioned, decouple in certain cases once the appropriate blow-ups are performed.
in other cases we must include these states to obtain the complete description of a given
orientifold.

some of the non-perturbative orientifolds have perturbative heterotic duals. however,
non-perturbative orientifolds with, say, d5-branes are non-perturbative from the heterotic

2

viewpoint. in this paper we are therefore exploring some vacua in the region d in fig.1
(which has been borrowed from [13]). thus, the z
6 orbifold compactication we discuss in
section iii is an example of a four dimensional chiral n = 1 supersymmetric string vacuum
which is non-perturbative from both orientifold and heterotic points of view.

in the next section we give examples of six dimensional non-perturbative orientifolds.
these are illustrative as the gravitational anomaly cancellation requirement in six dimensions
is rather constraining which makes it easier to discuss such vacua. once we understand these
six dimensional examples, we move down to four dimensions in section iii.

ii. six dimensional examples

in this section we will give an example of a non-perturbative six dimensional orientifold
with n = 1 supersymmetry. this vacuum corresponds to the  orientifold of type iib on
the z6 orbifold limit of k3 (that is, k3 in this case is t 4/z6). alternatively, this model
can be viewed as a type i compactication on the same k3 with d5-branes. in the dual
heterotic picture these d5-branes are mapped to small instantons.

thus, consider type iib on m2 = t 4/z6 (with trivial ns-ns b-eld), where the gen-

erator g of z6( z3  z2) acts on the complex coordinates z1, z2 on t 4 as follows:

gz1 = z1 ,

gz2 = 1z2 ,

(1)

where   exp(2i/6). this theory has n = 2 supersymmetry in six dimensions.

next, we consider the  orientifold of this theory. note that, as we have already men-
tioned in the previous section, the  projection acts as in the smooth k3 case. this, in
particular, implies that we must rst blow up the orbifold singularities before orientifolding.
thus, after orientifolding the closed string sector contains only one tensor multiplet
(but no extra tensor multiplets), and 20 hypermultiplets (plus the corresponding n = 1
supergravity multiplet). here 2 of the above hypermultiplets come from the untwisted
sector, 2 more arise in the z6 twisted sectors g, g1, 10(= 2  5) hypermultiplets come from
the z3 twisted sectors g2, g2 (note that 5 linear combinations of the original 9 points xed
under the z3 action are invariant under the z2 twist), and, nally, 6 hypermultiplets come
from the z2 twisted sector g3 (note that 6 linear combinations of the original 16 points xed
under the z2 action are invariant under the z3 twist).

as to the open string sector, there are 32 d9-branes plus 32 d5-branes. this is required
by the untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions. in the following we will consider the case
where all 32 d5-branes are sitting on top of each other at one of the orientifold 5-planes
which we choose to be that at the origin of the orbifold (that is, at z1 = z2 = 0). we
can view the usual (untwisted) 99 and 55 open string sectors as the -twisted sector
of the orientifold. similarly, the 59 sector can be viewed as g3-twisted sector. these
sectors are perturbative from the orientifold point of view. that is, these sectors can be
understood in the usual world-sheet picture using the standard d-brane techniques. there
are, however, additional sectors in this model which do not possess such a simple description.
these are the g2- and g2-twisted sectors, which can be viewed as the z3 twisted 99
plus 55 sectors, as well as the g- and g1-twisted sectors, which can be viewed as the
z3 twisted 59 sector. these z3 twisted open string sectors are non-perturbative from the

3

orientifold viewpoint. nonetheless, using type i-heterotic duality we can (in this particular
example) understand these sectors and obtain the corresponding massless states.

the key observation here is the following. first, recall the z3 model of [3]. this model
is obtained as follows. consider type iib on m2 = t 4/z3 (with trivial ns-ns b-eld),
where the generator  of z3 (which is a subgroup of the above z6 orbifold group with the
identication  = g2) acts on the complex coordinates z1, z2 on t 4 as follows:

z1 = z1 ,

z2 = 1z2 ,

(2)

where   2 = exp(2i/3). next, consider the j  orientifold of this theory, where
 is the same as above (that is, it acts as in the smooth k3 case), whereas j , which
was discussed in the previous section, maps the  twisted sector to the 1 twisted sector
[14]. after orientifolding the closed string sector contains (along with the corresponding
n = 1 supergravity multiplet) 10 tensor multiplets (one usual tensor multiplet plus 9 extra
tensor multiplets) and 11 hypermultiplets. in the open string sector we have 32 d9-branes
(but no d5-branes), and the action of the orbifold group on the chan-paton charges is
given by the corresponding projective representation of z3 in terms of the 16  16 matrices1
{1, , 1}, where 1 = i16 is the 1616 identity matrix, 1 = 1
, and (up to equivalent
representations)  is given by



 = diag(i4, 1i4, i8) .

(3)

note that the above form of  is dictated by the corresponding twisted tadpole cancellation
conditions [3]. the massless spectrum of the open string sector of this model consists
of gauge vector supermultiplets of u(8)  so(16) as well as the corresponding charged
hypermultiplets transforming in the irreps (28, 1) and (8, 16) of the gauge group. note that
the above spectrum satises the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition [16]

nh  nv = 273  29nt ,

(4)

where the number of tensor multiplets nt = 10, the number of hypermultiplets nh = 167
(11 of which arise in the closed string sector, while the other 156 come from the open string
sector), and the number of vector multiplets (all of which come from the open string sector)
nv = 184.

the above model does not possess a perturbative heterotic dual as it contains extra tensor
multiplets. the reason for their appearance is that the orientifold projection was chosen as
j . on the other hand, had we chosen the orientifold projection (after the appropriate
blow-ups) to be , we would have obtained a vacuum with no extra tensor multiplets in
the closed string sector. if, however, we choose the chan-paton matrices to be the same as
above (which in the 99 sector would lead to the same massless spectrum), we would obtain
an anomalous model where the condition (4) is not satised. this signals that the naive
orientifold (that is, world-sheet) approach in this case misses some states whose existence is
dictated by the anomaly cancellation conditions.

1throughout this paper we work with 16  16 (rather than 32  32) chan-paton matrices for we
choose not to count the orientifold images of the corresponding d-branes.

4

fortunately, in the above case we can actually understand the origin of the missing
states by using type i-heterotic duality. the point is that the  orientifold of type iib
on the (appropriately blown up) orbifold t 4/z3 is the same as type i compactied on
the same space. the latter should be dual to a perturbative heterotic compactication as
we have no d5-branes in this case.
in fact, we can identify the corresponding heterotic
vacuum as being the t 4/z3 compactication with the gauge bundle dened by the orbifold
action on the spin(32)/z2 degrees of freedom given by the matrices {w1, w, w1} 
{1, , 1}. here the 16  16 w-matrices act on the spin(32)/z2 momentum states
as the corresponding rotations. (alternatively, we can describe this action in terms of the
corresponding shifts of the spin(32)/z2 momentum lattice.) the resulting heterotic model is
perturbatively well dened (that is, it satises all the corresponding consistency requirements
such as modular invariance). the untwisted sector of this model contains the n = 1
supergravity multiplet, one tensor multiplet and 2 neutral hypermultiplets (these states are
mapped to the untwisted closed string sector of the dual type i vacuum); it also contains
the gauge vector supermultiplets of u(8)  so(16) as well as the corresponding charged
hypermultiplets transforming in the irreps (28, 1) and (8, 16) of the gauge group (these
states are mapped to the untwisted open string sector of the dual type i vacuum described
above). the twisted sector of the heterotic model contains 18 hypermultiplets (neutral
under the non-abelian subgroups but fractionally2 charged under the u(1) subgroup) plus 9
additional hypermultiplets transforming in the irrep (28, 1) of u(8)  so(16) (these states
are also fractionally charged under the u(1) subgroup). the above 18 hypermultiplets
correspond to the orbifold blow-up modes, and are mapped to the twisted closed string
sector hypermultiplets on the type i side. note that the 9 twisted hypermultiplets (on the
heterotic side) charged under the su(8) subgroup have no match in the orientifold picture.
that is, these are non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint. nonetheless, they must
exist in the corresponding type i model. in fact, they are precisely the states required to
satisfy the anomaly cancellation condition (4). these states (which are charged under the 99
gauge group) can be thought of as arising in z3 twisted 99 sector. type i-heterotic duality
is then a tool which allows us to understand such states (by doing a perturbative heterotic
calculation) which do not possess a world-sheet description in the orientifold language. for
the later convenience we give the massless spectrum of the z3 model in table i.

let us now go back to the z6 model we have dened in the beginning of this section.
since the z3 model with the  orientifold projection and the choice of the gauge bundle
(3) is consistent, the z6 model should also be consistent as long as we make sure that the
corresponding z2 model is consistent. that is, we must choose the action of the z2 twist on
the chan-paton factors appropriately.

2these charges are fractional in the normalization (which is conventional in discussing the ori-
entifold models) where the fundamental of su (8) has charge +1 under the corresponding u (1)
subgroup. in the following we will omit the u (1) charges which generically are fractional in the
twisted open string sectors. in certain cases one can determine these charges using the type
i-heterotic duality (as on the heterotic side these charges can be computed in the corresponding
twisted sectors). nonetheless, we choose not to do this here as various subtleties involved in such
computations might have obscured the main point of this paper.

5

a consistent solution for the chan-paton matrices in the z2 model was given in [1,2].
thus, consider type iib on m2 = t 4/z2 (with trivial ns-ns b-eld), where the generator
r of z2 reects the complex coordinates z1, z2 on t 4: rz1,2 = z1,2. next, consider the 
orientifold of this theory. the closed string sector contains (along with the corresponding
n = 1 supergravity multiplet) one tensor multiplet and 20 hypermultiplets (4 of which come
from the untwisted sector, and the other 16 come from the z2 twisted sector). in the open
string sector we have 32 d9-branes plus 32 d5-branes. let all of the d5-branes sit on top of
each other at the orientifold 5-plane located at the origin of the orbifold. then the twisted
d9- and d5-brane chan-paton matrices 9,r and 9,r are given by

9,r = 5,r = diag(ii8, ii8) .

(5)

the massless spectrum of the open string sector consists of gauge vector supermultiplets of
u(16)99  u(16)55 as well as the corresponding charged hypermultiplets transforming in the
irreps 2  (120; 1) (99 sector), 2  (1; 120) (55 sector), (16; 16) (59 sector). this spectrum
is summarized in table i, and it can be seen to satisfy the anomaly cancellation condition
(4).

the untwisted 99, 55 and 59 sector matter content in the full z6 model is the same
as in the z6 model of [3]. in particular, the orbifold action on the chan-paton charges is
given by the corresponding twisted chan-paton matrices (which are identical for both d9-
and d5-branes in the present setup):

9, = 5, = diag(i4, 1i4, i8) ,
9,r = 5,r = diag(ii2, ii2, ii2, ii2, ii4, ii4) .

(6)
(7)

here  = g2 and r = g3 (g is the generator of the z6 orbifold group). thus, the gauge
group is [u(4)  u(4)  u(8)]99 in the 99 sector. since we have placed all the d5-branes
on top of each other at the orientifold 5-plane located at the origin, the 55 sector gauge
group [u(4)  u(4)  u(8)]55 is the same as in the 99 sector. the matter content of the
untwisted 99, 55 and 59 sectors (these are the sectors that are perturbative from the
orientifold viewpoint) is given in table i.

we are now ready to determine the twisted 99, 55 and 59 sector matter content in
the full z6 model. the twisted 99 sector states are straightforward to determine. we have
already discussed the matter arising in the twisted 99 sector in the z3 model. to obtain the
corresponding states in the z6 model we must project onto the z2 invariant states. note
that the original 9 xed points can be organized into 5 linear combinations invariant under
the z2 twist plus 4 linear combinations which pick up a minus sign under the z2 twist. thus,
after taking into account the z2 action on both the xed points and chan-paton charges,
in the twisted 99 sector we have 5 copies of hypermultiplets in the irreps (6, 1, 1)99 and
(1, 6, 1)99, and also 4 copies of hypermultiplets in the irrep (4, 4, 1)99.

the twisted 55 sector is a bit more subtle. since we have placed all of the d5-branes
at the origin (which is a xed point of both the z3 and z2 twists), it follows that we have
only one copy of hypermultiplets in irreps (6, 1, 1)55 and (1, 6, 1)55. (no hypermultiplets in
the irrep (4, 4, 1)55 appear as the origin is invariant under the z2 twist.) in particular, the
other 8 of the original 9 xed points of the z3 twist play no role in this discussion as the
twisted 55 states arise due to the local geometry near the origin.

6

finally, the twisted 59 sector contains one copy of hypermultiplets in the irreps
(4, 1, 1; 4, 1, 1)59 and (1, 4, 1; 1, 4, 1)59. the multiplicity of these states follows from consid-
erations similar to those in the 55 sector. as to the gauge charges, they are dictated by the
fact the twisted states of this type (due to their origin discussed in the previous section) can
only be charged under the part of the original gauge group (in this case so(32)) broken by
the corresponding (that is, z3) twist.

the full massless spectrum of the z6 model is summarized in table i (there we also
give the massless spectra of the z2 and z3 models). it is straightforward to check that the
anomaly cancellation condition (4) is satised in this model. note that the twisted 99 and
55 sectors no longer exhibit the naive t-duality. this is due to the fact that these sectors
do not arise via a straightforward orbifold reduction of the corresponding (so(32)) gauge
theory (with n = 2 supersymmetry in six dimensions).

thus, the z2 orbifold model of [1,2] is perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint, but
is non-perturbative in the heterotic language.
in contrast, the z3 model in table i is
perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint, but has no perturbative orientifold description.
the z6 model is non-perturbative in both orientifold and heterotic pictures. here we should
point out that the z4 case with the  projection (instead of the j  projection as in [3])
does not appear to be tractable in the above approach as the action of the z4 twist on the
chan-paton charges in this case does not correspond to a perturbative gauge bundle on the
heterotic side. thus, to understand the z4 case one would need a dierent approach.

we would like to end this section with the following comment. following [4] we could
attempt to construct similar non-perturbative orientifolds with non-trivial ns-ns b-eld
turned on. unfortunately, however, we would then loose control over the non-perturbative
(twisted) states. thus, for instance, the z3 model with a non-zero ns-ns b-eld of rank
2 does not appear to have a perturbative heterotic dual. nonetheless, in the next section
we will see that in four dimensions one can nd cases with non-zero ns-ns b-eld which
can be understood within the present approach.

iii. four dimensional examples

in this section we extend the discussion in the previous section and obtain non-

perturbative orientifolds with n = 1 supersymmetry in four dimensions.

thus, consider type iib on m3 = t 6/z

erators  and r of the z3 and z2 subgroups of z
follows:

6 (with trivial ns-ns b-eld), where the gen-
6 act on the complex coordinates on t 6 as

z3 = 1z3 ,
z1 = z1 ,
rz1 = z1 , rz2 = z2 , rz3 = z3 ,

z2 = z2 ,

(8)
(9)

where   exp(2i/3). this theory has n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions.

next, consider the  orientifold of this theory. here  acts as in the smooth calabi-yau
case. this, in particular, implies that we must rst appropriately blow up (some of) the
orbifold singularities before orientifolding.

after orientifolding the closed string sector contains the n = 1 supergravity multiplet,
the dilaton plus axion supermultiplet, and also 46 chiral supermultiplets. in particular, 4

7

of these arise in the untwisted sector, 18 come from the z3 twisted sector, and z2 and z6
sectors each contribute 12 chiral supermultiplets.

as to the open string sector, there are 32 d9-branes and 32 d5-branes. this is required
by the untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions. in the following we will focus on the case
where all 32 d5-branes (which wrap the z3 complex direction) are sitting on top of each
other at the orientifold 5-plane located at z1 = z2 = 0.

the untwisted 99, 55 and 59 sectors in this orientifold (that is, the sectors with well
dened perturbative description) have been obtained in [810]. however, in [10] it was
pointed out that there are also twisted 99, 55 and 59 sector contributions one must take
into account. this should be clear from the discussion in the previous section.
in fact,
following the approach we have used for constructing the six dimensional z6 model in the
previous section, we can also obtain the massless states in the twisted open string sectors
in the four dimensional z
6 model as well. since the discussion in the four dimensional
case parallels quite closely that for the six dimensional example, we simply summarize the
massless spectrum of the z
6 model in table ii. let us, however, mention that the multiplicity
3 in the twisted 55 and 59 sectors is due to the fact that there are 3 xed points in the z3
direction which the d5-branes wrap. on the other hand, the original 9 xed points relevant
in the discussion for the twisted 99 sector decompose into 6 linear combinations invariant
under the z2 twist plus 3 linear combinations that pick up a minus sign under the z2 twist.
as to the orbifold action on the chan-paton factors, in this case it is given by the same
chan-paton matrices (6) and (7) as in the six dimensional case.

note that the four dimensional z

6 orbifold model (with trivial ns-ns b-eld) given in
table ii is chiral. in fact, it is an example of a chiral n = 1 supersymmetric string vacuum
which is non-perturbative from both the orientifold and heterotic viewpoints. the spectrum
of this model can be seen to be free of non-abelian gauge anomalies, and their cancellation
in this case in non-trivial. in particular, the untwisted open string sectors alone produce
an anomaly free spectrum. the twisted sector contributions are also anomaly free. this
is why the naive (that is, perturbative) tadpole cancellation conditions for this orientifold
give rise to an anomaly free model. nonetheless, this does not imply that the spectrum
obtained via the orientifold techniques is complete. in fact, the non-perturbative (that is,
twisted) sector contributions are non-trivial, and must be taken into account.

before we end this section, we would like to discuss a similar model with a non-trivial
ns-ns b-eld turned on. thus, consider the above z
6 orbifold model in the presence of the
non-zero ns-ns b-eld in the z1 direction3. thus, let t 6 = t 2  t 4, where the two-torus t 2
is parametrized by the complex coordinate z1 (on which the z3 twist  acts trivially), whereas
the four-torus t 4 is parametrized by the other two complex coordinates z2, z3. turning on
the b-eld (or rank 2) corresponding to t 2 results in rank reduction in both 99 and 55 sectors
by a factor of 2 [17,4]. on the heterotic side this corresponds to turning on two wilson lines
on the two non-contractable cycles of t 2 such that they reduce the original so(32) gauge
in particular, the rst wilson line corresponding to,
symmetry down to so(16) [11,18].

3as we have already mentioned in the previous section, turning on the b-eld in the z2 and/or z3
directions would result in a loss of control over the twisted open string states as they would have
no perturbative description on the heterotic side.

8

say, the a-cycle of t 2 breaks so(32) down to so(16)  so(16). then the second wilson
line corresponding to the b-cycle of t 2 breaks so(16)  so(16) to its diagonal so(16)diag
subgroup. this can be viewed as a freely acting z2 orbifold which permutes the two so(16)
subgroups. in the so(16)diag language the z3 orbifold action on the spin(32)/z2 degrees
of freedom can then be described in terms of the 8  8 matrices {w1, w, w1}, where
w1 = i8, w = diag(i2, 1i2, i4), and w1 = w1
 . on the orientifold side we then
identify the corresponding 8  8 chan-paton matrices via {1, , 1}  {w1, w, w1}.
such an identication is in fact consistent with the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions
which, in particular, imply that we must have tr() = +2 (instead of tr() = +4 as in
the case without the b-eld) [13]. thus, we conclude that in this case the heterotic gauge
bundle is indeed perturbative, and we can therefore obtain, say, the twisted 99 sector states
via the corresponding heterotic computation.

the spectrum of the above z

6 model with the b-eld can be computed in complete
parallel with the case without the b-eld with the following straightforward modications.
first, the corresponding twisted chan-paton matrices (which we now write in the 8  8
basis) are given by:

9, = 5, = diag(i2, 1i2, i4) ,
9,r = 5,r = diag(i, i, i, i, ii2, ii2) .

(10)
(11)

the gauge group is [u(2)  u(2)  u(4)]99  [u(2)  u(2)  u(4)]55 (all the d5-branes are
sitting on top of each other at the orientifold 5-plane located at z1 = z2 = 0). the spectrum
of the open string sector can then be read o the spectrum in table ii (corresponding to the
case without the b-eld) with the obvious substitutions for the irreps of the corresponding
gauge subgroups. note, however, that the multiplicities of (both untwisted as well as twisted)
59 sector states is now 2 times that shown in table ii. this doubling of states is due to the
rank-2 b-eld, and was explained in detail in [4].

before we end this section, let us point out that the approach we have described in
the previous sections can be straightforwardly applied to study other four dimensional ori-
entifolds with twisted (that is, non-perturbative) sectors. more concretely, these are the
z2  z6, z3  z6 and z6  z6 cases whose perturbative (from the orientifold viewpoint)
massless spectra were discussed in [8]. (the z3  z6 case was also discussed in [9].) we will
not consider these models in detail in this paper but will come back to them in [19] where we
intend to discuss a more general class of type i compactications, namely, on voisin-borcea
orbifolds. note, however, that the non-perturbative sectors in the z12 model of [9] are not
tractable within the above approach as z12 contains a z4 subgroup. as we have already
mentioned in the previous section, this case requires techniques other than those employed
in this paper.

fig. 1. a schematic picture of the space of four dimensional n = 1 type i and heterotic
vacua. the region a  b corresponds to perturbative type i vacua. the region a  c corresponds
to perturbative heterotic vacua. the vacua in the region a are perturbative from both the type
i and heterotic viewpoints. the region d contains both non-perturbative type i and heterotic
vacua.

sentations. the subscript u  indicates that the corresponding (untwisted) state is perturbative
from the orientifold viewpoint. the subscript t  indicates that the corresponding (twisted)
state is non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint. the u (1) charges are not shown, and
by neutral hypermultiplets we mean that the corresponding states are not charged under the
non-abelian subgroups.

the semi-colon in the column charged chiral multiplets separates 99 and 55 representations.
the subscript u  indicates that the corresponding (untwisted) state is perturbative from the
orientifold viewpoint. the subscript t  indicates that the corresponding (twisted) state is
non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint. the u (1) charges are not shown, and by neutral
chiral multiplets we mean that the corresponding states are not charged under the non-abelian
subgroups.
