abstract

we investigate the decay of a scalar eld outside a schwarzschild anti de sitter black

hole. this is determined by computing the complex frequencies associated with quasinor-

mal modes. there are qualitative dierences from the asymptotically at case, even in

the limit of small black holes. in particular, for a given angular dependence, the decay is

always exponential - there are no power law tails at late times. in terms of the ads/cft

correspondence, a large black hole corresponds to an approximately thermal state in the

eld theory, and the decay of the scalar eld corresponds to the decay of a perturbation

of this state. thus one obtains the timescale for the approach to thermal equilibrium.

we compute these timescales for the strongly coupled eld theories in three, four, and six

dimensions which are dual to string theory in asymptotically ads spacetimes.

1. introduction

it is well known that if you perturb a black hole, the surrounding geometry will ring,

i.e., undergo damped oscillations. the frequencies and damping times of these oscillations

are entirely xed by the black hole, and are independent of the initial perturbation. these

oscillations are similar to normal modes of a closed system. however, since the eld can

fall into the black hole or radiate to innity, the modes decay and the corresponding

frequencies are complex. these oscillations are known as quasinormal modes. for black

holes in asymptotically at spacetimes, they have been studied for almost thirty years

[1,2]. the radiation associated with these modes is expected to be seen with gravitational

wave detectors in the coming decade. motivated by ination, the quasinormal modes of

black holes in de sitter space have recently been studied [3,4].

for spacetimes which asymptotically approach anti de sitter (ads) spacetime the

situation is slightly dierent. in the absence of a black hole, most elds propagating in

ads can be expanded in ordinary normal modes. the cosmological constant provides an

eective conning box, and solutions only exist with discrete (real) frequencies. however

once a black hole is present, this is no longer the case. the elds can now fall into the

black hole and decay. there should exist complex frequencies, characteristic of the black

hole, which describe the decay of perturbations outside the horizon. we will compute these

quasinormal frequencies below, for spacetimes of various dimensions.

the quasinormal frequencies of ads black holes have a direct interpretation in terms
of the dual conformal eld theory (cft) [5,6,7,8].1 according to the ads/cft corre-

spondence, a large static black hole in ads corresponds to an (approximately) thermal

state in the cft. perturbing the black hole corresponds to perturbing this thermal state,

and the decay of the perturbation describes the return to thermal equilibrium. so we

obtain a prediction for the thermalization timescale in the strongly coupled cft. it seems

dicult to compute this timescale directly in the cft. since the system will clearly not

thermalize in the free eld limit, at weak coupling, this timescale will be very long and

depend on the coupling constant. in the limit of strong coupling, it seems plausible that

the timescale will remain nonzero, and be independent of the coupling. this is because

1 the importance of these modes in ads was independently recognized in [9], but they were
not computed. they were computed in [10], but only for a conformally invariant scalar eld whose

asymptotic behavior is similar to at spacetime. the conning behavior of ads is crucial for the

ads/cft correspondence.

1

the initial state is characterized by excitations with size of order the thermal wavelength,

so causality suggests that the relaxation timescale should also be of order the thermal

wavelength.

the results we obtain are consistent with this expectation. a black hole in ads is

determined by two dimensionful parameters, the ads radius r and the black hole radius

r+. the quasinormal frequencies must be functions of these parameters. for large black
holes, r+  r, we will show that there is an additional symmetry which insures that
the frequencies can depend only on the black hole temperature t  r+/r2. however,
for smaller black holes, this is no longer the case. whereas the temperature begins to

increase as one decreases r+ below r, we nd that the (imaginary part of the) frequency
continues to decrease with r+. this is dierent from what happens for asymptotically at
black holes. an ordinary schwarzschild black hole has only one dimensionful parameter

which can be taken to be the temperature. its quasinormal frequencies must therefore be

multiples of this temperature. thus small black holes in ads do not behave like black

holes in asymptotically at spacetime. the reason is simply that the boundary conditions

at innity are changed. more physically, the late time behavior of the eld is aected by

waves bouncing o the potential at large r.

another dierence from the asymptotically at case concerns the decay at very late

times. for a schwarzschild black hole, it is known that the exponential decay associated

with the quasinormal modes eventually gives way to a power law tail [11]. this has been

shown to be associated with the scattering of the eld o the coulomb potential at large

r. as we will discuss later, for asymptotically ads black holes, this does not occur.

we will compute the quasinormal frequencies for schwarzschild-ads black holes in

the dimensions of interest for the ads/cft correspondence: four, ve, and seven. we will

consider minimally coupled scalar perturbations representing, e.g., the dilaton. this cor-

responds to a particular perturbation of the cft. for example, for ads5, it corresponds
to a perturbation of an (approximately) thermal state in super yang-mills on s3  r with
< f 2 > nonzero. in the linearized approximation we are using, the spacetime metric is

not aected by the scalar eld. so the perturbation of the thermal state does not change

the energy density, which remains uniform over the sphere. the late time decay of this

perturbation is universal in the sense that all solutions for the dilaton with the same angu-

lar dependence will decay at the same rate, which is determined by the imaginary part of

the lowest quasinormal frequency. dierent perturbations, corresponding to dierent lin-

2

earized supergravity elds, will have dierent quasinormal frequencies and hence decay at

dierent rates. although we work in the classical supergravity limit, our results would not

be aected if one includes small semiclassical corrections such as black holes in equilibrium

with their hawking radiation.

a brief outline of this paper is the following.

in the next section we review the

denition of quasinormal modes, their relation to the late time behavior of the eld, and

derive some of their properties using analytic arguments. the numerical approach we use

to compute the complex frequencies is described in section 3. in the following section we

discuss the results for both large black holes r+  r and intermediate size black holes
r+  r. in section 5 we consider the limit of small black holes r+  r. although there
is a striking similarity between some of our results and some results obtained in the study

of black hole critical phenomena [12], we will argue that this is probably just a numerical

coincidence. the conclusion contains some speculations about the cft interpretation of

the quasinormal frequencies in the regime where they do not scale with the temperature.

in the appendix, we give some more details on our numerical calculations.

2. denition of quasinormal modes and analytic arguments

since we are interested in studying ads black holes in various dimensions, we begin

with the d dimensional schwarzschild-ads metric:

ds2 = f (r) dt2 + f (r)1dr2 + r2 d2

d2

where

f (r) 

r2

r2 + 1 (cid:16) r0

we are interested in solutions to the minimally coupled scalar wave equation

if we consider modes

2 = 0

(t, r, angles) = r

2d

2 (r) y(angles) eit

(2.5)

(2.6)

where y denotes the spherical harmonics on sd2, and introduce a new radial coordinate

dr = dr/f (r), the wave equation reduces to the standard form

[2

r + 2  v (r)] = 0.

(2.7)

the potential v is positive and vanishes at the horizon, which corresponds to r = .
it diverges at r = , which corresponds to a nite value of r.

to dene quasinormal modes, let us rst consider the case of a simple schwarzschild

black hole. since the spacetime is asymptotically at, the potential now vanishes near

innity. clearly, a solution exists for each  corresponding to a wave coming in from

innity, scattering o the potential and being partly reected and partly absorbed by the

black hole. quasinormal modes are dened as solutions which are purely outgoing near
innity   ei(tr) and purely ingoing near the horizon   ei(t+r). no initial

incoming wave from innity is allowed. this will only be possible for a discrete set of

complex  called the quasinormal frequencies.

for the asymptotically ads case, the potential diverges at innity, so we must require

that  vanish there. in the absence of a black hole, r has only a nite range and solutions

exist for only a discrete set of real . however once the black hole is added, there are

again solutions with any value of . these correspond to an outgoing wave coming from

the (past) horizon, scattering o the potential and becoming an ingoing wave entering the

(future) horizon. quasinormal modes are dened to be modes with only ingoing waves

near the horizon. these again exist for only a discrete set of complex .

it should perhaps be emphasized that these modes are not the same as the ones that

have recently been computed in connection with the glueball masses [13]. there are several

dierences: first, the background for the glueball mass calculation is not the spherically

symmetric ads black hole, but an analytic continuation of the plane symmetric ads black

hole. second, because of the analytic continuation, the horizon becomes a regular origin,

and the boundary conditions there are not the analytic continuation of the ingoing wave

4

boundary condition imposed for quasinormal modes. finally, the glueball masses are real

quantities, while as we have said, the quasinormal frequencies will be complex. this makes

them more dicult to compute numerically.

one can show [14,2] that the complex quasinormal frequencies determine the fall o

of the eld at late times. the basic idea is to start by writing the solution to the wave

equation in terms of the retarded greens function and initial data on a constant t surface.

one then rewrites the greens function in terms of its fourier transform with respect to

t. the quasinormal modes arise as poles of the greens function in the complex frequency

plane, and their contributions to the solution can be extracted by closing the contour with

a large semicircle near innity.

for a black hole in asymptotically at spacetimes, price [11] showed that after the

exponential decay due to the quasinormal ringing, the eld will decay as a power law
  t(2l+3) where l is the angular quantum number. this has been seen explicitly in

numerical simulations [15]. mathematically, this is due to a cut in the greens function

along the negative imaginary frequency axis. more physically, this behavior is due to

scattering o the weak coulomb potential near innity. for the case of a black hole in

ads, the potential diverges at innity and vanishes exponentially near the horizon. ching

et. al. [14] have analyzed the late time behavior of a broad class of wave equations with

potentials. they show that there are no power law tails for a potential which vanishes

exponentially. so there will be no power law tails for black holes in ads.

for a black hole with radius much smaller than the ads radius, one might expect

an intermediate time regime where one sees power law behavior before the new boundary

conditions at innity become important. however, this would occur only if one starts

with large quasinormal modes with   1/r+ associated with a schwarzschild black hole.
we will see that the lowest modes of a schwarzschild-ads black hole are much smaller

and their exponential decay is so slow that it eliminates the intermediate time power law

behavior.

the quasinormal frequencies will in general depend on the two parameters in the
= 2ds2, and rescaling the coordinates t = t

2

problem r, r0. by rescaling the metric, bds

and r = r, the new metric again takes the form (2.1) with rescaled constants r and

r0. since the wave equation (2.5) is clearly invariant under this constant rescaling of the
metric, we can use it to set e.g. r = 1. this rescaling is possible for any metric and

physically just corresponds to a choice of units. in our case, we measure all quantities in

5

units of the ads radius. the quasinormal frequencies can still be arbitrary functions of

r0.

we now show that for large black holes, r0  r, the frequencies must be proportional
to the black hole temperature. this is a result of an independent scaling one can do in

this limit. for large black holes, the region outside the horizon of the schwarzschild-ads

metric (2.1) becomes approximately plane symmetric:

ds2 = h(r) dt2 + h(r)1dr2 + r2 dxidxi

(2.8)

(2.9)

where

h(r) 

.

r2

r2 (cid:16) r0

r (cid:17)d3

for this metric one can rescale r0 by a pure coordinate transformation: t = at, xi =
axi, r = r/a for constant a. this does not rescale the overall metric, or the ads radius
r. the horizon radius rd1
gets rescaled by r+ = r+/a. of course, under this
coordinate transformation of the metric, solutions of the wave equation are related by the
same coordinate transformation. for solutions which are independent of xi (the analog
of the l = 0 modes) we have ei(r+)t = ei(r+)t, which implies (r+)  r+. since the
hawking temperature of the metric (2.8) is also proportional to the horizon radius,

+ = r2rd3

0

t =

d  1

4

r+
r2

(2.10)

we see that the frequencies must scale with the temperature for large black holes. for
solutions proportional to eikixi
so if r2

, this scaling argument implies (ar+, aki) = a(r+, ki).
+  kiki, one can rescale so that k2 is negligibly small. the above argument then
shows that  still scales with the temperature. one can then rescale back to r+  r
to apply to large black holes.
in other words, for any ki, the quasinormal frequencies
scale with the temperature in the limit of large temperatures t 2  k2. this argument

does not apply to black holes of order the ads radius, and indeed we will nd that the

quasinormal frequencies do not scale with the temperature in this regime. but it does

conrm the expectation that the approach to thermal equilibrium in the dual eld theory

should depend only on the temperature (at least for large temperature).

since we want modes which behave like ei(t+r) near the horizon, it is convenient to

set v = t+r, and work with ingoing eddington coordinates. the metric for schwarzschild-

ads in d dimensions in ingoing eddington coordinates is

ds2 = f (r) dv2 + 2 dv dr + r2 d2

d2

(2.11)

where f is again given by (2.2). the minimally-coupled scalar wave equation (2.5) may be

reduced to an ordinary, second order, linear dierential equation in r by the separation of

variables,

(v, r, angles) = r

2d

2 (r) y(angles) eiv

(2.12)

this yields the following radial equation for (r):

where

c = l(l + d  3)

(2.15)

is the eigenvalue of the laplacian on sd2. note that v (r) is manifestly positive for d  4.

we wish to nd the complex values of  such that (2.13) has a solution with  nite

at the horizon, r = r+, and vanishing at innity. this can only be done numerically, but
some general properties can be seen analytically. for example, we now show that there

are no solutions with  pure imaginary, and 2i < f (r+).
then the equation would be real and the solutions  would be real. if there were a local

if  were pure imaginary,

extremum at some point r, then  (r) = 0 and  (r) would have the same sign as (r).

so if  were positive at r, it would have to increase as r increased. similarly, if it were

negative, it would have to decrease. in neither case, could it approach zero asymptotically.

we conclude that the solutions must monotonically approach zero. now if 2i < f (r+),
 (r+) has the same sign as (r+). so as one moves away from the horizon, the solutions
move farther away from zero and hence can never reach zero asymptotically. this analytic

argument only applies if 2i < f (r+). but we will see numerically that even without this
restriction, there are no solutions with  pure imaginary.

a more powerful result can be obtained as follows. multiplying (2.13) by  and

integrating from r+ to  yields

the rst term can be integrated by parts without picking up a surface term since f (r+) = 0
and () = 0. this yields

z 

r+

dr[f | |2 + 2i   + v ||2] = 0

(2.17)

taking the imaginary part of (2.17) yields

z 

r+

dr[   +   ] = 0

integrating the second term by parts yields

(  )z 

r+

dr   = |(r+)|2

substituting this back into (2.17) we obtain the nal result

z 

r+

dr[f | |2 + v ||2] = 

||2|(r+)|2

im

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

since f and v are both positive denite outside the horizon, this equation clearly shows

that there are no solutions with im  > 0. these would correspond to unstable modes

which grow exponentially in time. there are also no solutions with im  = 0: all solutions

must decay in time. in addition, eq. (2.20) shows that the only solution which vanishes

at the horizon is zero everywhere. since the equation is linear, we can always rescale  so

that (r+) = 1.

3. numerical approach to computing quasinormal modes

to compute the quasinormal modes, we will expand the solution in a power series

about the horizon and impose the boundary condition that the solution vanish at innity.

in order to map the entire region of interest, r+ < r < , into a nite parameter range,
we change variables to x = 1/r. in general, a power series expansion will have a radius

of convergence at least as large as the distance to the nearest pole. examining the pole

structure of (2.13) in the whole complex r plane, we nd d + 1 regular singular points,

at r = 0, r = , and at the d  1 zeros of f , one of which, r = r+ corresponds to the
horizon. at least for d = 4, 5 or 7, if we use the variable x = 1/r and expand about the

8

horizon, x+ = 1/r+, the radius of convergence will2 reach to x = 0, so that we can use
this expansion to consider the behavior of the solution as r  .

in terms of our new variable x = 1/r, (2.13) becomes

s(x)

should be viewed as a function of the horizon radius: rd3

the parameter rd3
since s, t, and u are all polynomials of degree d we may expand them about the horizon
n=0 sn (x  x+)n, and similarly for t(x) and u(x). it will be useful to
note that s0 = 2x2
+ (  i), and u0 = 0, where  is the surface gravity, which
is related to the black hole temperature (2.4) by  = 2t . also, since s0 6= 0, x = x+ is
a regular singular point of (3.1). the solution which is smooth at the horizon can thus be

+ , t0 = 2x2

0 =

.

expressed as a power series,

(x) =

xn=0

an (x  x+)n

(3.5)

substituting (3.5) into (3.1) and equating coecients of (x  x+)n for each n, we obtain
the following recursion relations3 for the an:

an = 

1
pn

n1xk=0

[k(k  1) snk + k tnk + unk] ak

(3.6)

where

pn = n(n  1) s0 + n t0 = 2x2

+n (n   i)

(3.7)

2 for d = 4 and d = 5, one can show analytically that starting at the horizon, x = x+, the
nearest pole is indeed x = 0. for d = 7 we have checked numerically that this is again the case.
3 although the standard way of writing (3.1) is to set the coecient of  to 1 which yields
simpler-looking recursion relations, the advantage of the present formulation is that since s(x),

t(x), and u(x) are polynomials, their analytic expansions will terminate after a nite number of

terms, so that each an will be given in terms of a relatively small number of terms.

9

since the leading coecient a0 is undetermined, this yields a one parameter family of
if  is pure imaginary and i = n for
solutions, as expected for a linear equation.

some integer n, then pn = 0. this implies an additional constraint on the coecients ak,
k = 0,    , n  1 which will only be satised if they vanish. since  vanishes at the horizon

when a0 = 0, (2.20) implies that  vanishes everywhere. so one can immediately see that
there are no nontrivial solutions with i/ equal to an integer.

the solutions to (2.5) in asymptotically ads spacetime are   constant and  
and   rd/2, respectively. we are

1/rd1 as r  , which translates into   r

d2

2

interested in normalizable modes, so we must select only solutions which satisfy   0 as

r   (or x  0). this means that we require (3.5) to vanish at x = 0, which is satised

only for special (discrete) values of . (for all other values of , the solution will blow

up, (0) = .) thus in order to nd the quasinormal modes, we need to nd the zeros of
n=0 an() (x+)n in the complex  plane. this is done by truncating the series after a
large number of terms and computing the partial sum as a function of . one can then nd

p

zeros of this partial sum, and check the accuracy by seeing how much the location of the

zero changes as one goes to higher partial sums. some details are given in the appendix.

4. discussion of results

the numerical procedure described above can be applied to both large black holes

(r+  r) and intermediate size black holes (r+  r). in this section we describe the
results. we set r = 1, and decompose the quasinormal frequencies into real and imaginary

parts:

 = r  ii

(4.1)

with the sign chosen in (4.1), i is positive for all quasinormal frequencies.

in table 1., we list the values of the lowest quasinormal mode frequencies for l = 0 and

selected values of r+, for the four, ve, and seven dimensional schwarzschild-ads black
holes. for large black holes, both the real and the imaginary parts of the frequency are

linear functions of r+. since the temperature of a large black hole is t = (d  1)r+/4, it
follows that they are also linear functions of t . this is clearly shown in g. 1 and g. 2,

where i and r respectively are plotted as a function of the temperature for the four,
ve, and seven dimensional cases. the dots, representing the quasinormal modes, lie on

straight lines through the origin. in g. 1, the top line corresponds to the d = 4 case, the

(4.3)

this linear scaling with the temperature is in agreement with the general argument in

section 2. according to the ads/cft correspondence,  = 1/i is the timescale for the
approach to thermal equilibrium. eq. (4.2) is one of the main results of this work.

for the intermediate size black holes, the quasinormal frequencies do not scale with

the temperature. this is clearly shown in g. 3 which plots i as a function of r+ for

a straight line i = 2.66 r+. the dashed curve represents the continuation of the curve
i = 11.16 t shown in g. 1. to smaller values of r+. (for large r+ these two curves are
identical.) it is not yet clear what the signicance of this linear relation is for the dual

cft. some speculations are given in section 6. since the quasinormal frequencies can be

computed to an accuracy much better than the size of the dots in g. 3, one can check

that the points actually lie slightly o the line. this is shown more clearly in the ve

dimensional results in g. 4. once again the dashed curve is the continuation of the curve

i = 8.63 t shown in g. 1, and the solid curve is the line i = 2.75 r+ that it approaches
asymptotically.

the real part of the quasinormal frequencies are shown in similar plots in g. 5 for

d = 4 and g. 6 for d = 5. r approximates the temperature more closely than the black
hole size, but it is clear from g. 6 that it is not diverging for small black holes.

we have so far discussed only the lowest quasinormal mode with l = 0. we have also

computed higher modes and modes with nonzero angular momentum, but the numerical

accuracy decreases as one increases the mode number n or l. so we restrict our attention

to relatively small values of n and l.

for large black holes, in both four and ve dimensions, we nd that the low lying

quasinormal modes are approximately evenly spaced in n. in particular, for r+ = 100,
i (n)  41 + 225 n and r(n)  54 + 131 n in four dimensions, whereas i (n)  73 + 201 n

increasing the angular momentum l mode has the surprising eect of increasing the

damping time scale ( i decreases), and decreasing the oscillation time scale (r increases).

l for low values of l.4 an important open question is the behavior of i as l  . it
appears to decrease with l, but the general argument in section 2 shows that it cannot

become negative.

if i continues to decrease with l, then the late time behavior of a
general perturbation will be dominated by the largest l mode. the large l behavior of

i is currently under investigation. preliminary results indicate that the frequencies stay
bounded away from zero. if this were not the case, and i approached zero fast enough,
then a general superposition of all spherical harmonics could decay at late times only as a

power law. however, even this would not be a problem for the ads/cft correspondence,

since the decomposition into spherical harmonics can be done in the boundary eld theory
as well. the statement is that, e.g., a perturbation of < f 2 > with given angular depen-
dence yl on s3 will decay exponentially with a time scale given by the imaginary part of
the lowest quasinormal mode with that value of l.

5. comments on small black holes

in this section we briey discuss the extrapolation of the quasinormal frequencies to

the small black hole regime (r+  r). our numerical approach becomes unreliable in this
regime, so we cannot compute them directly. instead, we must rely on indirect arguments.

but rst we give some motivation for exploring this question.

4 the size of the dots is not related to the accuracy of the calculation.

15

small ads black holes are not of direct interest for the ads/cft correspondence. this
is because an extended black hole of the form schwarzschild-ads cross sm is unstable

to forming a black hole localized in all directions whenever the radius of the black hole

is smaller than the radius of the sphere. this is a classical instability rst discussed by

gregory and laamme [16]. it is quite dierent from the hawking-page transition [17,18]

which applies to black holes in contact with a heat bath. in that case, when the black hole

is of order the ads radius it undergoes a transition to a thermal gas in ads. the hawking-

page transition can be avoided if we consider states of xed energy, not xed temperature.

then black holes dominate the entropy even when r+ < r and continue to do so until
r+/r is less than a negative power of n [19,20]. the situation is very similar to the old
studies of a black hole in a box. for xed total energy, the maximum entropy state consists

of most of the energy in the black hole, and a small amount in radiation. unfortunately,

the stable small black hole conguration must be a ten or eleven dimensional black hole

(by the gregory-laamme instability) and is not known explicitly.

nevertheless, there may be other applications of the quasinormal modes of small black

holes in ads. one possibility comes from the striking fact (shown in g. 3) that for d = 4,

i is proportional to r+ to high accuracy. as we will discuss below, the slope of this line,
2.66, turns out to be numerically very close to a special frequency which arises in black

hole critical phenomena rst studied by choptuik [12]. to explore this possible connection,

one needs to consider quasinormal modes of small black holes.

from the intermediate black hole results shown in the previous section, it is tempting

to speculate that as r+  0, i  0, and r  constant. since the decay of the eld is due
to absorption by the black hole, it is intuitively plausible that as the black hole becomes

arbitrarily small, the eld will no longer decay. it is even possible that the quasinormal

modes approach the usual ads modes in the limit r+  0, although this is not guarenteed
since the boundary conditions at r = r+ do not reduce to regularity at the origin as r+  0.
if they do approach the usual modes in this limit, then r must approach d  1 [21]. of
course, in the context of string theory, one cannot trust the schwarzschild-ads solution

when the curvature at the horizon becomes larger than the string scale. by taking the ads

radius r suciently large, one can certainly use this solution to describe some small black

holes, but the geometry would have to be modied before the limit r+  0 is reached.

it has been shown that the low energy absorption cross section for massless scalars

incident on a general asymptotically at spherically symmetric black hole is always equal

fig. 8: the curved line is a t to the modes of a small black hole in d = 5.
the modes approach the straight line shown at large r+.

to the area of the event horizon [22]. we can use this to estimate the imaginary part of

the lowest quasinormal mode for a small ads black hole as follows. imagine a wave with

energy of order 1/r propagating toward a black hole with r+  r. then the spacetime
around the black hole is approximately schwarzschild, and the low energy condition is

satised, so the amplitude of the reected wave r will be reduced from the amplitude
of the incident wave i, by 1  (r/i)2  rd2
+ . after a time of order the ads radius,
the reected wave will bounce o the potential at innity with no change in amplitude. it

will again encounter the black hole potential and be partly absorbed and partly reected.
repeating this process leads to a gradual decay of the eld   et with   rd2
+ .

this suggests that for small black holes, i should scale like the horizon area rd2
+ .
in the large black hole regime, on the other hand, we know that the modes should scale

linearly with r+. to check this, we consider a simple ansantz which interpolates between
these two regimes and see how well it ts the data. consider the function i (r+)) =
b+rm1
(where a corresponds to the asymptotic slope). for each m we choose b to give the best

arm
+

+

t to the intermediate black hole data, and see which m yields the lowest overall error (as
measured by 2).

in the ve dimensional case, using seven points between r+ = .4 and r+ = 1, we indeed
nd that m = 3 gives the best t: 2  9  106 for m = 3, as opposed to 2  3  102

for m = 2 and m = 4. the actual t, shown in g. 8 along with the modes and the

asymptotic line, is given by i (r+) 
clear, since there is no signicant dierence between the t with m = 2 and the t with

. in four dimensions the story is much less

+

17

m = 3. this could be due to the fact that the data for intermediate black holes have not

yet started to signicantly deviate from a straight line.

to see the possible connection with black hole critical phenomena, consider the evo-

lution of a self gravitating spherically symmetric scalar eld (in an asymptotically at 4d

spacetime). it is clear that weak waves will scatter and go o to innity, just like in at

spacetime. strong waves will collapse and form a black hole. choptuik [12] studied one

parameter families of initial data (labelled by p) which interpolated between these two ex-

tremes. in each case there is a critical solution p = p which marks the boundary between

forming a black hole or not forming one. the late time behavior of this critical solution
turns out to be universal. it has precisely one unstable mode which grows like et with

 = 2.67. this mode is responsible for the famous scaling of the black hole mass for p just
above the critical value, mbh  (p  p) where  = 1/ = .374. (for a review, see [23].)

the numerical value of  is very close to the slope, 2.66, of the line in g. 3 giving the

imaginary part of the quasinormal mode frequencies. since both numbers involve imag-

inary frequencies for spherically symmetric scalar elds in four dimensions, it is natural

to wonder if there might be a deeper connection between these two phenomena. unfor-

tunately, it appears at the moment that the agreement is just a numerical coincidence.

the rst thing one might check is whether the agreement continues in higher dimensions.

although the critical solutions for black hole formation have not been studied in ve or

seven dimensions, they have recently been calculated in six dimensions [24] with the result

 = 1/.424 = 2.36. we have redone our calculation in six dimensions and do not nd

agreement. the slope of i as a function of r+ turns out to be 2.693. another dierence
is that the exponents in black hole critical phenomena are known to be independent of

the mass of the scalar eld. we have checked that the quasinormal frequencies of large

and intermediate black holes do depend on the mass. one might expect that if there is a

connection between these two phenomena, it would apply in the limit of small ads black

holes. however, we have seen that the modes of small black holes actually deviate from

the linear relation, so the signicance of the asymptotic slope is not clear. while it is

still possible that some deeper connection exists (perhaps just in four dimensions and for

massless elds) it appears unlikely.

as an aside, we note that if one repeats the calculation of critical phenomena for

spacetimes which are asymptotically ads, the late time results will be quite dierent.

since energy cannot be lost to innity, if one forms a black hole at all, it will eventually

18

grow to absorb all the energy of the initial state.

6. conclusions

we have computed the scalar quasinormal modes of schwarzschild-ads black holes in

four, ve, and seven dimensions. these modes govern the late time decay of a minimally

coupled scalar eld, such as the dilaton. for large black holes, it is easy to see that these

modes must scale with the black hole temperature t . by the ads/cft correspondence,

this decay translates into a timescale for the approach to thermal equilbrium in the cft,

for large temperatures and perturbations dual to the dilaton. the timescale is simply

given by the imaginary part of the lowest quasinormal frequency,  = 1/i . from (4.2),
for perturbations with homogeneous expectation values (l = 0 modes) these timescales are

 = .0896/t for the three dimensional cft,  = .116/t for the four dimensional super

yang-mills theory, and  = .183/t for the six dimensional (0, 2) theory. as we mentioned

earlier, these time scales are universal in the sense that all perturbations of the dilaton

with the same angular dependence will decay at this rate. perturbations associated with

other linearized supergravity elds will decay at dierent rates, given by their quasinormal

mode frequencies.

perhaps the most surprising aspect of our analysis are the results for intermediate size

black holes. for black holes with size of order the ads radius, we nd that the quasinormal

frequencies do not continue to scale with temperature, but rather scale approximately

linearly with horizon radius. we do not fully understand the implications of this linear

relationship for the dual eld theories, but we can make the following comments. if one

considers the eld theory at constant temperature, and slowly lowers the temperature,

then one encounters the hawking-page transition [17,18]. at this point the supergravity

description changes from the euclidean black hole to a thermal gas in ads. for these low

temperatures, the relaxation time might still scale with the temperature, but it cannot

be computed by a classical supergravity calculation, and is not related to quasinormal

frequencies.

to interpret the quasinormal frequencies of intermediate size black holes, we must

consider a microcanonical description. consider all states in the cft with energy equal

to the supergravity energy. most of these states will be macroscopically indistinguishable,

in the sense that they will all have the same expectation values of the operators dual to

the supergravity elds. if the only nonzero expectation value is the stress energy tensor,

19

the states are described on the supergravity side by just the black hole. if you perturb one

of these cft states to one which is macroscopically slightly dierent, it will decay to a

typical state with a timescale set by the lowest quasinormal mode. the results in section

4 show that this decay time is determined by the size of the black hole in the supergravity

description. of course the eld theory knows about the black hole size since its entropy is

given by the black hole area. however the fact that, in this range of energy, the frequency

scales linearly with the radius is puzzling.

the fact that the quasinormal frequencies do not continue to scale with temperature

is also interesting for the following reason. for a certain range of energies, the supergravity
entropy s(e) is dominated by small (ten or eleven dimensional) black holes5 [19]. this

means that the eective temperature, dened by ds/de = 1/t , has the property that

it decreases as the energy increases, i.e. the specic heat is negative. by the ads/cft

correspondence, the same must be true in the dual cft. (this is not a problem since it

applies to only a nite range of energies.) if the quasinormal modes continued to scale with

the temperature, then this negative specic heat would have dynamical eects. instead,

we nd that the relaxation time increases monotonically with decreasing energy.

the zeros of p

as discussed in section 3, in order to nd the quasinormal modes, we need to nd
n=0 an() (x+)n in the complex  plane. we compute the quasinormal
modes using mathematica, in the following way. we search for the zeros, n , of n () 
n=0 an() (x+)n by looking for the minima of |n |2, and checking that the value at
the minimum is zero, |n (n )|2 = 0.
(in practice, there are numerical errors in the
computation, so the value at the minimum is instead  1014, or smaller.) in order to

5 as we discussed in the previous section, these black holes can be quantum mechanically

stable, since they are in equilibrium with their hawking radiation.

nd the correct minimum, we need to specify an initial guess for n . (this sometimes
poses diculties in searching for new modes, and apart from using analytical or intuitive

understanding as our guide, we are forced to resort to trial and error.) how close to the

actual minimum one is required to start depends on the parameters; for the n = 1, l = 0

mode of reasonably-sized black hole, this seldom poses any limitations.

to obtain an accurate estimate of the quasinormal frequencies , we typically need to

compute on the order of n = 100 partial sums, depending on the dimension d, the black

hole size r+, and the mode (i.e. n and l). roughly speaking, at a xed partial sum n , the
relative error in the computed quasinormal frequency grows as r+ decreases, and as l, n,
or d increases.

the task of determining the mode to the necessary accuracy is fortuitously simplied

by the fact that the convergence curve has a surprisingly simple form. in particular,

once the partial sums have converged to sucient accuracy, the variation of n is given by
an exponentially damped sine as a function of n , i.e. n   + c en/a sin(bn + d) where
a and b depend on the physical parameters such as r+, while c and d just depend on which
partial sum we start with. in fact, we can use a tting algorithm in mathematica to t

these convergence curves. an example is given in g. 9, where the dots represent re(n )
for a particular set of parameters (d = 5, r+ = 0.6, n = 1, and l = 0), and the solid curve
is the corresponding t. this simplication allows us to determine the mode with a much

higher accuracy then we would be led to expect from the spread of n . it also allows us
to conrm that the numerical errors in the computation of each n are negligible, since

21

otherwise, one would expect a more noisy distribution.

often the quickest way to obtain the quasinormal mode is to simply look for the
minimum of |n |2 near various initial guesses for the frequency, but when that method
fails, we can also adopt a more systematic approach; eliminating the possibility of occurence

of quasinormal modes in a given frequency range. this may be carried out in a more

systematic manner due to the fact that re(n ()) and im(n ()) are conjugate harmonic
functions of , which must satisfy the maximum principle. thus, if we nd that n () is
bounded inside a given region of the complex  plane, and either re(n ()) or im(n ())
remains nonzero everywhere on the boundary, then n is necessarily nonzero everywhere
inside that region. this ensures that there can be no quasinormal modes with these

frequencies. we can thus systematically search for the lowest modes by eliminating the

low frequency regions until we nd the modes.

once we nd one mode for a given set of parameters, continuity of the solution allows

us to trace the mode through the parameter space; that is, we can nd  for nearby values

of r+ and l. also, once we know the n = 1 and n = 2 modes for a xed r+ and l, the equal
spacing between the modes allows us to nd the higher n modes (provided the numerical

errors stay small).

thus, the procedure for nding (r+) is the following: we rst consider a large black
hole, where the convergence is good at a low partial sum, e.g. n = 40. for such a low

cut-o n on the partial sum, we may easily compute n (, r+, l) in full generality. we
nd the desired mode n (r+, n, l) using the method described above, and we can check
the convergence by comparing this result with that obtained for the lower partial sums.

we can now follow the mode to smaller values of r+, until the convergence becomes too
slow, and we need to compute higher partial sums. it becomes more practical at this point

to x all the parameters, and consider n as a function of  only. this has the numerical
advantage of enabling us to compute the partial sums to much higher n ; the drawback,

of course, is that now we need to recompute the whole series for each r+.
