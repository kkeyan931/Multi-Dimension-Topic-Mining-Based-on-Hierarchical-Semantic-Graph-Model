abstract
we test the renormalization of wilson operators and the mandelstam- leibbrandt gauge
in the case when the sides of the loop are parallel to the n, n vectors used in the m-l
gauge. graphs which in the feynman gauge are free of ultra-violet divergences, in the m-l
gauge show double divergences and single divergences with non-local si and ci functions.
in appendix c we briey discuss the problems of the m-l gauge for loops containing
spacelike lines.

1. introduction.

we continue the study of renormalization of wilson operators, but now in the mandelstam-
leibbrandt light-cone gauge. it was noted [1] that if the wilson loop contains a straight
light- like segment, charge renormalization does not work in a simple graph-by-graph way,
but does work when certain graphs are added together. in the m-l gauge renormalization
is even more complicated. the wilson operator is dened as

w = t rp exp(igzc

a  dx)

(1)

where c is a closed curve, p denotes operator and matrix ordering along c, and the non-
abelian gauge eld a is a matrix in some representation r of the gauge group g. we shall
show to order g4 in perturbation theory that w in the m-l gauge obeys multiplicative
renormalizability required in [1],

wr(ar; gr) = z()wb(ab; gb, )

(2)

where suces r and b denote renormalized and bare quantities and dimensional regular-
ization with d = 4   is used. the relationship between gb and gr and between ar and
ab should be the same as in ordinary perturbation theory. z() is determined from the
vacuum expectation value hw i .

hwr(gr)i = z()hwb(gb, )i.

(3)

however, the divergences of the individual graphs are not of the short distance nature
and are non-local on the curve c. they are grouped into four tensors n
n
and nn. there are no transverse divergences of the type e.g. np, pp, (we use the
decomposition of the momentum p = 1
2 np + p), as argued in appendix a.
let the amplitude be

p+ + 1

, nn

, n

n

2 n

m = ann + bnn

 + cn

n + dn

n
.

the polarization vectors should satisfy

pe = 0, qf = 0

i.e.

e = pn  p+n

, f = qn  q+n
.

(4)

(5)

then we have four identities following from gauge invariance, which the amplitude should
satisfy.
(a) mef should be the same as feynman gauge when the external momenta p

and q are on shell,

(b) meq = 0 for p on shell,
mpf = 0 for q on shell,

2

(c) mpq = 0.
(a), (b) and (c) impose the constraint on (4)

q+a + qb = 0.

(6)

(7)

a, b, c and d turn out to be local, although from the example of the self-energy graph [2],
one might have expected non-local divergences to occurr with the wilson loop. if we take
a self-energy part and try to derive an on-shell physical thing, we get zero (we take s(p),
put p2 = 0, multiply by ee where e is a polarization vector satisfying p e = 0). therefore
we cannot deduce much by arguing that physical things are gauge invariant - we get just
0 = 0. but, for the wilson loop, we do not get zero if we put p2 = q2 = 0 and multiply
by polarization vectors. so the gauge-independence argument does give some information.
as the feynman gauge non-local divergences cancel [1], (a), (b) and (c) explain why there
are no non-local divergences in the m-l wilson operator. the abelian crcr part obeys
the factorization theorem [3], [4]. therefore in this work we shall concentrate only on
the non-abelian cgcr part of the graphs, where cr and cg are the casimirs for the
representation used to dene the wilson loop and the gluons.

2. the n

n

 sector

we list the nal results for the sets of graphs grouped according to their topological
equivalence. the multiplication by the overall factor c is understood for each graph.

the graphs contributing to the a-set are shown in fig.1. there are also graphs with
p and q interchanged. we denote the frequent non-local functions which appear in all
equations by

ci(x) = ci(x)  ln x  

si(x) = si(x) +

then the ultra-violet divergent part of the graphs in fig.1 is

g1 - set

g1-set of graphs are the graphs with one 3-gluon vertex. there are two groups of

such graphs. the two graphs shown in fig.7 give

{(eipl + 1)[ci(pl) + 2 +

(18)

of course the graphs with p and q interchanged must be added. the graphs in fig.8 give

w b(g1) = (eit p+  1)(eit q+  1)(eiql  1)

{2(eipl  1) + (eipl  1)ci(pl) + i(eipl + 1)si(pl)}.

(19)

again there is a symmetric set of graphs with p and q interchanged.

g(l+r) - set

adding the symmetric graphs to fig.9, the total sum of 4 graphs is

g(l + r) = 2(eit r+ + 1){(eirl + 1)[ci(pl) + ci(ql)  ci(rl)]

5. discussion
the results for the nn, nn and nn sectors, (15),(22) and (32) satisfy the requirement
of multiplicative renormalizability (2). the eld renormalization matrix in the m-l gauge
is [6]

ab

 (x) = (1 +

11
6

c)[  cn(n

 

n  p
n  p

n)]ar

 (x)

where

= z ar

 (x)

c =

g2
82

cg

and coupling constant renormalization is

gb = (1 

11
6

c)gr.

(33)

then (2) on the right hand side contains various sorts of fourth order terms.

(a) wb to fourth order, z, z and gb to zeroth order
(b) wb to second order, z to second order
(c) wb to second, gb to second
(d) wb to second, z to second

then (b) contributes only to the abelian crcr part, while (c) and (d) should give
the counter-terms needed to cancel the uv divergences we found in (a). of course, since

10

wb to second order has two real gluons, that is two ab operators, it gets two z factors,
one depending on p and the other on q. then the operator zwb + gbwb on the right of
(2) gives for the sectors separately

(34)

the sum of (1) and (2) gives exactly the counter-terms needed to cancel (15), (22) and (32).
the complications with non-local sine and cosine divergences are caused by the choice of
the m-l gauge, not the lightlike sides of the wilson loop, as shown in appendix c.

appendix a

as an illustration of why there are no transverse components in the wilson operator, let us
take one of the characteristic integrals which appear in the graph with one 3-gluon vertex
in fig.7.

z = z dnk

(eit (pk)+  eit k+ )

2k

k2(p  k)2k+



1

(p  k)

(eikl  1)(1  ei(pk) l) = p  m

(a1)

we multiply both sides by the perpendicular momentum p, and write

2p  k = k 2  k+k  (p  k)2 + (p  k)+(p  k) + p+k + pk+

(a2)

z  p = p 2  m = z dnk
{eit p+ (eit k+  1)  (eit k+  1) + (eit p+  1)}

(p  k)2  k2 + pk+ + p+k

k2(p  k)2k+



1

(p  k)

{eipl(ei(pk)l  1) + ei(pk) l  1}

(a3)

in this form we can integrate each of the terms in (a3). k+p gives uv nite term as the
integrals of the type

i = z dnk

1

k2(p  k)2

eit k+

1

(p  k)

(ei(pk)l  1)

(a4)

contain the oscillating factor eit k+ which suppresses the possible uv divergences. let us
denote by y the contribution from kp+.

y = z dnk

p+k

k2(p  k)2k+

 {eit p+ (eit k+  1)  (eit k+  1) + (eit p+  1)}



1

(p  k)

{eipl(ei(pk)l  1) + ei(pk) l  1}

(a5)

the factor (eit p+  1) gives only uv nite term. also we can write

k

(p  k)

=

(k  p) + p

(p  k)

because both poles lie in the same half-plane with k+ regulated in the sense of mandelstam
[5]. other terms have no pole at k+ = 0. for the rst (eit k+ 1) we close the contour in the
upper half-plane and pick up a pole at k+ = k 2
(k), while for the second (eit k+ 1)
we close the contour in the lower half-plane and pick up a pole at k+ = k 2

(k).

hence there are no uv divergences in the transverse momentum p.

we explain why strict application of dimensional regularization is not possible in the case
of spacelike and timelike lines. as an example let us take the self-energy type of graph in
the triangle wilson loop with one spacelike and two lightlike sides shown in fig.20.

there are two poles in the upper-half complex k0 plane.

(a)

(b)

k2 + i = 0,

k0 = k + i

k+ + ik = 0,

 this feature of the m-l prescription was noticed already in a. andrasi, hep-th

naively, one would strictly apply the rules of dimensional regularization and set the second
integral to zero as a tadpole in the perpendicular momentum k. however, after the
introduction of polar coordinates

k3 = k cos  = kx,

d3k = k2dk(1  x2) 

2 dxz d,

z d =

2

21 
(1  
2 )

(c5)

and integration over k, the rst integral leads to an integral which is not dened for
any . therefore we have to keep  in the integrand. we can choose two ways. either
we evaluate integrals separately in terms of the spurious, ambiguous terms of the form
 

2 2 dictated by the tadpole

and sum it up with the rst integral in (c4) leading to

w1 = ieip3lp1

1x2+4ix2 is for the regular-
we notice how crucial the contribution from the tadpole 
ization of the pole at x = 1. only after the addition of the tadpole we can set  = 0 in
(c8) and evaluate the integrals in the strip 1 <  < 4. in the same way we evaluate the
second part of (c1) with

denominator. thus we obtain the result for (c1)

(c9)

this graph in the feynman gauge contains only simple single poles. hence, the funny
non-local sine and cosine divergences and the double pole are caused by the choice of the
m-l gauge, not the lightlike sides of the loop.

 let us mention that the change of variable k3 into k3 in the second part of (c1) is

not permitted as it creates the pole in k3.
