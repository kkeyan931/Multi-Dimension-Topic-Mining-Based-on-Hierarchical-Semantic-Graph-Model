abstract

the quantisation of gauge invariant systems usually proceeds through some gauge xing
procedure of one type or another. typically for most cases, such gauge xings are plagued
by gribov ambiguities, while it is only for an admissible gauge xing that the correct dy-
namical description of the system is represented, especially with regards to non perturbative
phenomena. however, any gauge xing procedure whatsoever may be avoided altogether,
by using rather a recently proposed new approach based on the projection operator onto
physical gauge invariant states only, which is necessarily free on any such issues. these
dierent aspects of gauge invariant systems are explicitely analysed within a solvable u(1)
gauge invariant quantum mechanical model related to the dimensional reduction of yang-
mills theory.

introduction

as beautiful, elegant and powerful as is the general principle of local gauge invariance, there
is also a price to be paid, especially when it comes to quantising such theories.
indeed, the
characteristic feature of systems possessing such symmetries is the presence among their de-
grees of freedom of redundant gauge variant variables required for a manifest realisation of the
gauge invariance principle, and possibly also of other symmetries such as spacetime covariance.
consequently, the actual physical conguration space of these systems is typically quite intri-
cate, whose non trivial topology is at the heart of fundamental non perturbative phenomena
responsible for the rich physics implied by these theories.

the actual physical conguration space, being parametrised by the initial degrees of free-
dom modded out by the set of local (large and small) gauge transformations, corresponds to the
set of gauge orbits in the conguration space of initial degrees of freedom. usually the quantisa-
tion of such systems implements rst some gauge xing procedure of one kind or another, which
should in principle select among the initial degrees of freedom a single representative of each
one of all the gauge orbits accessible to the system throughout its dynamical time evolution,
thereby dening an admissible gauge xing procedure. however, most gauge xing procedures
do not meet that requirement, and are then said to be plagued by a gribov ambiguity[1, 2].
in fact, two types of gribov ambiguities ought to be distinguised[3]. the rst type of gribov
problem, or local gribov problem, arises when a gauge xing procedure selects more than
one representative of the same gauge orbit, the important point being however that the total
number of these representatives must be summed by also accounting for the oriented integration
measure induced on the physical conguration space of gauge orbits by the local integration
measure on the initial conguration space[3, 4]. the second type of possible gribov problem,
or global gribov problem, arises when not all gauge orbits of the system are selected through
some gauge xing procedure[2]. clearly, an admissible gauge xing procedure is one which does
not suer neither local nor global gribov problems.

in spite of the importance of the issue, especially when it comes to non perturbative
phenomena, the global gribov problem is usually not specically considered in the literature,
though it is a possibility which often arises[2, 3]. a local gribov problem on the other hand,
arises typically when the so-called faddeev reduced phase space approach[3] for example is
developed towards the quantisation of a gauge invariant system1, even in the simplest cases[3].
the original example of a gribov problem[1] could be of this type, but when accounting for
the oriented integration measure over the space of gauge orbits, it may well be that the original
gribov example of gauge redundancy in a gauge xing procedure is not a gribov problem after
all[4]. in fact, gribovs suggestion for a resolution of local gribov problems, by restriction to the
fundamental domain of non vanishing eigenvalues of the faddeev-popov determinant within the
rst gribov horizon, has not met with the widest consensus. indeed, the point has repeatedly
been made[4, 3] that one ought rather to count the multiple intersections of the gauge slice with
the selected gauge orbits with an alternating signature determined by the oriented integration
measure over the space of gauge orbits. recently, that specic issue has been addressed again
with the same conclusion in contradistinction to gribovs suggestion, within the context of a
solvable u(1) gauge invariant quantum mechanical model inspired essentially by the dimensional
reduction of ordinary yang-mills theories to 0+1 dimensions[5].

besides the faddeev reduced phase space approach, there also exists the bfv-brst in-
variant extended phase space formulation of gauge invariant systems, which in eect also imports

1note that a non vanishing faddeev-popov determinant establishes the absence of a local gribov problem only
but not necessarily of a global one, and then only for innitesimal gauge transformations but not necessarily for
nite (small and even large) ones. thus, a non vanishing faddeev-popov determinant does not necessarily dene
an admissible gauge xing procedure in the sense considered above[3], contrary to the common usage of the word
in the literature.

1

the same issues of a gauge xing procedure and the ensuing possible gribov problems[3]. even
though these questions then arise in another disguise, nevertheless they need to be addressed
specically within that context as well, even in the simplest of examples2[3].

the issue of gribov problems thus needs to be considered on a case by case basis, not
only for each physical system being studied, but also for each gauge xing procedure which
may be contemplated for a given system. moreover, the gribov problem issue is also very
much dependent on the choice of boundary conditions which are being implemented for a given
dynamical problem[1, 2]. hence, no procedure for resolving gribov ambiguities in general, when
they appear, can be formulated.

however, such issues arise specically because of the apparent necessity of gauge xing in
gauge invariant systems. if gauge xing could be avoided altogether, no gribov problems would
arise, and the issue would no longer need to be addressed. indeed, the recent proposal[6] of the
physical projector within diracs original approach to the quantisation of constrained systems[3]
precisely achieves[7] a correct integration over the space of gauge orbits of a system, in which all
orbits are eectively included once and only once, without the necessity in no way whatsoever
of performing a gauge xing procedure of any kind. in particular when considering the time
evolution operator for gauge invariant states, the physical projector readily ensures that only
physical states contribute as intermediate states to the physical propagator, a feature which is
usually achieved only through gauge xing to a reduced phase space description or by extending
the quantum dynamics to include a ghost sector which compensates for those contributions from
gauge variant states.

the purpose of the present paper is to consider these dierent issues within the context of
the simple u(1) gauge invariant solvable model of ref.[5], by relying on a series of considerations
and results developed in refs.[3, 8, 9, 10]. the denition of the model, which is very much similar
to the general class of systems studied in ref.[9] already in terms of the physical projector, is
recalled in sect.2 together with its classical hamiltonian formulation. sect.3 then discusses its
dirac quantisation, by constructing the conguration space wave functions of the physical gauge
invariant states.
in sect.4, a specic admissible gauge xing procedure leading to a reduced
phase space description of the model is developed, thereby enabling the explicit evaluation of
the conguration space representation of the gauge invariant quantum evolution operator. sect.5
then considers the same matrix elements within the bfv-brst approach, and illustrates how
only admissible gauge xing proceduresin the sense of the word as dened abovelead to
the correct result for the gauge invariant evolution operator of physical states. all these results
are then directly contrasted against those obtained in sect.6 through the physical projector
approach simply dened within the context of the dirac quantisation of the model, thereby
readily leading again to the correct result for the physical propagator of the system to which
only physical states contribute as intermediate states. finally, sect.7 presents the conclusions
of the analysis.

2 the model and its classical hamiltonian analysis

the dynamics of the u(1) gauge invariant model of ref.[5] is dened by the lagrangian,

l =

1

2h( x + gy)2 + ( y  gx)2 + ( z  )2i  v (cid:18)qx2 + y2(cid:19) ,

or in terms of polar coordinates,

(2)

l =

2

r2(cid:16)   g(cid:17)2

+

( z  )2  v (r)

,

2note that when gribov ambiguities arise for a given gauge xing procedure, be it in the faddeev reduced
phase space approach or the bfv-brst invariant one, they need to be addressed already at the classical level[3].

2

with of course,

x = r cos 

,

y = r sin 

.

(3)

here, x(t), y(t) and z(t) are cartesian coordinates, (t) is a gauge variableessentially the time
component of a u(1) gauge connection after dimensional reduction to 0+1 dimensions, and g
is a gauge coupling constant. henceforth, we also choose to work with the harmonic potential
term,

v (r) =

2 r2

.

(4)

1
2

it should be clear that this model possesses a u(1) gauve invariance whereby the (x(t), y(t))
coordinates are rotated by some arbitrary time dependent angle (t) in the two dimensional plane
which they dene, while at the same time the variables z(t) and (t) are shifted by a quantity
proportional either to (t) or (t). hence, this invariance of the system is best expressed in the
polar parametrisation, namely,

r(t) = r(t) , (t) =  + (t) , z(t) = z(t) +

(t) , (t) = (t) +

1
g

g

(t) .

(5)

this property of the system already raises the issue of the choice of boundary conditions
to be imposed on its degrees of freedom. since later on we are interested in computing the
quantum evolution operator of the model for gauge invariant states, boundary conditions need
to be specied at two distinct moments in time ti and tf , with tf > ti. however, which of the
degrees of freedom (x, y, z; ) need to have their values specied at these values of t is a matter
of their physical status.

in fact, two distinct physical interpretations of the degrees of freedom (x, y, z) are possible,

among which two combinations are manifestly gauge invariant, namely,

while the third gauge variant combination may be chosen to be for example,

r(t)

, (t) = (t)  gz(t)

,

(t) = (t) + gz(t)

.

(6)

(7)

in particular, note how the gauge invariant combinations r and  show that the gauge orbits in
the space (x, y, z) are nothing else than helicoidal curves of constant radius r, whose symmetry
axis is parallel to the z axis, and whose slope w.r.t. the (x, y) plane is set by the coupling g.
consequently, given any conguration (r(t), (t), z(t)), a nite and unique gauge transformation
of parameter function (t) may always be found such that at all times z(t) = 0, namely
(t) = gz(t), so that also (t) = (t).

hence, one possible physical interpretation of the degrees of freedom of the system is
to consider that its actual conguration space is the entire set of such helicoidal curves thus
parametrised by the variables 0  r < + and 0   < 2, and which are in one-to-one
correspondence with the points (r, , z = 0) for all possible values of 0  r < + and 0   < 2.
this is the point of view taken in ref.[5] with regards to the nature of the conguration space
of the system. associated to the specic choice of admissible gauge xing eected through the
constraint z(t) = 0, which leaves no room for further non trivial gauge transformations, the
appropriate choice of boundary conditions is thus,

r(ti) = ri

, (ti) = i

, z(ti) = 0 ; r(tf ) = rf

, (tf ) = f

, z(tf ) = 0 ,

(8)

such that in particular (ti,f ) = i,f . note that consistency with these boundary conditions
requires the gauge transformation parameter (t) to vanish at the end points, i.e. (ti,f ) = 0.
however, this situation suggests another possibility, in which the physical interpretation of
the degrees of freedom is rather to consider that the actual conguration space of the system is

3

indeed the set of all coordinates (x, y, z) in a three dimensional euclidean space, with the two sets

that any physical quantity computed with this choice of boundary conditions will depend only on

of triplet values (cid:16)r(ti,f ), (ti,f ), z(ti,f )(cid:17) set to specic boundary values (cid:16)ri,f , i,f , zi,f(cid:17), knowing
the quantities (cid:16)ri,f , i,f = i,f gzi,f(cid:17). in this second interpretation, one decouples so to say the

gauge transformations of the system for parameter functions (t) which vanish at the endpoints
in time ti,f from those which do not (a distinction which, within this interpretation, is consistent
with the given boundary conditions), all in a continuous fashion. the latter transformations may
be used to transform the boundary conditions such that z(t) would vanish at the end points ti,f .
however, since we are solely interested in the propagator for physical states, the latter quantity
may only depend on the gauge invariant combinations ri,f and i,f of the boundary values
of trajectories. in other words, the physical propagator takes its values already only over the
actual conguration space of gauge orbits of the rst interpretation for the degrees of freedom
of the model. hence, in as far as the calculation of the physical propagator is concerned, the
action of those gauge transformations for which (ti,f ) 6= 0 is already accounted for through the
dependency on the variables i,f , rather than i,f and zi,f separately. thus given this second
point of view, gauge equivalence classes of physical trajectories are characterized by having xed
end points at t = ti,f , while all their other points (x(t), y(t), z(t)) associated to instants t distinct
from ti,f are gauge transformed into one another with arbitrary parameter functions (t) such
that (ti,f ) = 0.

except for sect.4 where the specic gauge xing z(t) = 0 is used from the outset, we shall

thus consider the following choice of boundary conditions

r(ti) = ri

, (ti) = i

, z(ti) = zi

; r(tf ) = rf

, (tf ) = f

, z(tf ) = zf

,

(9)

to which the second interpretation of the degrees of freedom (x, y, z) is associated. indeed, the
structure of the hamiltonian gauge invariance of the model then becomes much similar to that
of the parametrised relativistic scalar particle[3], so that results established in the latter case
may readily be borrowed for the calculation of the physical propagator in the present system,
and for a discussion of gribov problems in the context of its bfv-brst invariant quantisation.
let us now consider the hamiltonian formulation of the system in its polar representation.

conjugate momenta are simply,

while there appears the usual primary constraint

pr = r , p = r2h   gi , pz = z   ,

the canonical hamiltonian also reads,

p = 0 .

(10)

(11)

(12)

the consistent time evolution of the primary contraint p = 0 then requires only one more
secondary constraint

  pz + gp = 0 ,

(13)

which together with the primary constraint p = 0 forms a system of rst-class constraints,
whose poisson bracket is

equivalently[3], this whole hamiltonian formulation may simply be specied through the

{p, pz + gp} = 0 .

where 1,2(t) are lagrange multipliers for the two rst-class constraints. however, the following

lead to the rst-order lagrangian

(17)

that such a reduction of the hamiltonian formulation is consistent with the gauge in-
variances generated by the rst-class constraints p and  = pz + gp has been demonstrated
in ref.[3], thereby leading to the so-called[3] fundamental hamiltonian formulation of the
present model. indeed, the rst-class constraint p = 0 is a direct consequence of the auxilia-
ry character of the degree of freedom (t) which in fact turns out to be simply the lagrange
multiplier for the second rst-class constraint  = 0, generator of the u(1) gauge symmetry in
the hamiltonian formulation. thus, (t) is actually not a genuine dynamical degree of freedom
of the system. by using the fundamental hamiltonian formulation, this fact is made explicit,
while using the rst-order lagrangian (15) would introduce a new gauge symmetry generated
by p whose sole purpose is to lead to arbitrary time dependent shifts in the variable (t), then
articially considered as a genuine dynamical degree of freedom, while on the other hand two
more lagrange multipliers 1,2 are then introduced3.

let us note at this point that a similar discussion applies to the original lagrangian
formulation of the model in terms of its cartesian coordinate parametrisation. in that case, the
rst-order lagrangian associated to its fundamental hamiltonian formulation simply reads,

l3 = xpx + ypy + zpz

.

(18)

however, because of the nature of the u(1) gauge invariance of the system, the polar parametri-
sation is far more convenient than the cartesian one, and most of our considerations are based
on the former.

in its fundamental hamiltonian description, the model thus possesses three pairs of ca-
nonically conjugate phase space coordinates, (r, pr), (, p) and (z, pz), subject to the rst-class
constraint  = pz + gp = 0 of lagrange multiplier , and whose dynamics is generated by the
rst-class hamiltonian

(19)

in particular, the constraint  is the generator of the u(1) gauge symmetry on phase space
through the symplectic structure dened by the poisson brackets. innitesimal transformations
may be exponentiated to nite ones, given by

r = r , p

r = pr

where (t) is an arbitrary time dependent function parametrising hamiltonian u(1) gauge trans-
formations, subject to the boundary conditions (ti,f ) = 0 when either of the choices of boundary
conditions (8) or (9) applies.

3were one to view the lagrange multipliers 1,2 as genuine degrees of freedom[3], further rst-class constraints
and their associated lagrange multipliers would ensue, generating in turn new hamiltonian gauge symmetries
similar to that associated to  as just described. thus, the dynamical status of  is not dierent from that of 1,2,
and the genuine dynamical content of the model is indeed solely represented by the dynamical evolution of the
degrees of freedom (r, , z) and the constraint  = pz + gp, namely the fundamental hamiltonian formulation of
the system, a fact which applies to all gauge invariant systems[3].

5

since the gauge transformations of the lagrange multiplier  are independent of the phase
space degrees of freedom, the general notion of teichmuller space, namely the set of gauge
orbits in the space of the lagrange multipliers associated to all rst-class constraints[3], applies
in the present instance. given the boundary conditions (ti,f ) = 0, it is clear that the following
quantity,

 = z tf

ti

dt (t)

,

(21)

does dene a gauge invariant quantity in the space of lagrange multiplier functions (t). hence,
 is a coordinate parametrising the teichmuller space of the system, which in the present case
is identied with the entire real line. moreover, it should be quite clear that any gauge xing
in the space of lagrange multiplier functions (t) induces a gauge xing of the entire system
itself in its phase space formulation, since we must have (ti,f ) = 0. as a matter of fact, it may
easily be shown[3] that any admissible gauge xing in the space (t), thus associated to a single
covering of teichmuller space in which all values of  are obtained once and only once when
accounting for the oriented integration measure on teichmuller space, induces an admissible
gauge xing of the entire system itself. thus for example, a choice of gauge xing in the space
(t) such that the following set of functions is selected,

(t; ) =



tf  ti

,

(22)

where  is a free parameter taking all possible real values once and only once, automatically
induces an admissible gauge xing of the system itself. hence, for the present model, gauge
xing may be considered not only in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom (x, y, z), as
shown above through the choice z(t) = 0 for example, but it may also be eected through gauge
xing in the space of lagrange multiplier functions (t). note also how the characterization
of these dierent gauge xing procedures and the possible ensuing gribov problems is strongly
dependent on the choice of boundary conditions considered for the study of the time evolution
of system congurations.

in the polar parametrisation, the hamiltonian equations of motion are4

r = pr

,

pr =

p2
r3  2 r ;


 =

p
r2 + g ,

p = 0 ;

z = pz +  ,

pz = 0 ,

(23)

subject further to the rst-class constraint  = pz + gp = 0. note how due to the global
symmetries of the model under decoupled rotations in the (x, y) plane and translations along the
z axis, the angular momentum p and the linear momentum pz are each separately conserved
quantities through time evolution, p(t) = l and pz(t) = p. however, the gauge invariance
constraint  = 0 dening physical congurations, which generates time dependent translations
in z coupled to time dependent rotations in (x, y), brings into further relation these two conserved
quantities, such that p + gl = 0.

given the choice of boundary conditions (9), the construction of the general solution to
these equations of motion proceeds as follows. first, the values for the rotational energy5 er
and for the angular momentum l must be determined such that6,

4incidentally, both for (17) and (18), the hamiltonian reduction whereby all conjugate phase space coordinates,
pr, p and pz in the rst case, px, py and pz in the second, are solved for through the hamiltonian equations of
motion, leads back precisely to the original lagrangian formulations (1) and (2) of the model.

5the total energy e of the system is then given by e = er + p2/2.
6with our choice of harmonic potential v (r) = 2r2/2, these conditions may be solved explicitely, but the

ensuing expressions are not very informative, and are thus not given.

where the solution for r(t) is implicitely dened by the integral,

t  ti = z r(t)

.

(25)

in both this latter expression as well as in the previous one particularised to t = tf , the 1 sign
under the integral stands for the sign of the time derivative dr(t)/dt. once the values for er
and l thereby determined, the remaining phase space variables are given by,

(26)

in view of the gauge transformation of the lagrange multiplier in (20), note how the func-
tion (t) appearing in these solutions parametrises the gauge freedom, i.e. the gauge redundancy,
of the general solutions to the equations of motion of the original euler-lagrange equations asso-
ciated to the lagrangian (2). in particular, the gauge invariant combination (t) = (t) gz(t),
given by

(t) = [i  gzi] + lz t

ti

dt (cid:18) 1

r2(t)

+ g2(cid:19) ,

(27)

is indeed independent of the lagrange multiplier function (t).

however, for consistency of the construction of the solution, the choice of lagrange mul-

tiplier (t) must be such that the associated teichmuller parameter  takes the value,

 = z tf

ti

dt (t) = (zf  zi) + gl(tf  ti)

.

(28)

hence, if a gauge xing procedure is implemented such that the teichmuller parameter values
 of the lagrange multipliers (t) thereby eectively selected do not include this specic value
required by the choice of boundary conditions, the set of gauge orbits of the system retained
through gauge xing does not include the specic one which solves the equations of motion with
this choice of boundary conditions. clearly, for an admissible gauge xing, such a situation does
never arise since all possible values of  are then included once and only once. this simple remark
thus illustrates, at the classical level already, how a non admissible gauge xing procedure, thus
suering either a local or a global gribov problem, excludes from the retained congurations of
the system or includes with too large a multiplicity certain subsets which physically are perfectly
acceptable and should thus remain accessible to the system throughout its dynamical evolution
with a single multiplicity for each of its gauge orbits.

the set of teichmuller parameter values selected through the admissible gauge xing
choice z(t) = 0 will be discussed in detail in sect.4. generally, one-parameter sets of functions
(t) with their associated values for the teichmuller parameter  may be obtained through any
gauge xing procedure leading to an equation of the form[11, 12, 3]

 = f ()

,

(29)

where f () is some given function. indeed, the solution (t; f ) to this condition is determined
in terms of a single integration constant, which for later convenience we choose to be the value
taken by (t; f ) at t = tf , namely f = (tf ; f ). correspondingly, as the value of f runs
ti dt(t; f ) takes its values in a certain

from  to +, the teichmuller parameter (f ) = r tf

7

domain d[f ] and with a certain covering of that domain which both directly depend on the
function f () in (29). within this framework, an admissible gauge xing is related to a function
f () such that the domain d[f ] is the entire real line and with a covering such that all values
for  are obtained once and only once.

since the respective teichmuller spaces are identical, let us consider some of the specic
examples discussed in the case of the parametrised relativistic scalar particle in refs.[3, 12]. the
choice

f () = a + b

(30)

implies,

a(cid:19)(cid:16)1  ea(tf ti)(cid:17) 

(t; f ) = (cid:18)f +
which clearly thus denes an admissible choice of gauge xing, since as f varies from  to
+ the corresponding domain d[f ] is then indeed the entire real line with each value of 
obtained once and only once, irrespectively of the values of the arbitrary parameters a and b
dening the function f (). in particular, the simplest choice of such an admissible gauge xing
is obtained with f () = 0[11], thereby leading to the set of lagrange multiplier functions (t)
mentioned in (22) with (f ) = f (tf  ti).

a choice of a quadratic function for f () however, is associated to a non admissible gauge
xing. indeed[3], even though all real values of the teichmuller parameter are then obtained,
they are obtained twice while f runs from  to +, and with opposite orientations. hence
eectively, the actual covering of teichmuller space which is implied by such a choice for f ()
vanishes, establishing the non admissibility of such a gauge xing, which thus possesses a global
gribov problem, no gauge orbit being eectively retained. nevertheless, as the coecient of the
quadratic term in f () vanishes, the previous class of admissible gauge xings is recovered[3].

the only other example borrowed from ref.[3] we shall mention here is

f () = a3

,

a > 0 .

(32)

correspondingly, one nds

(t; f ) =

f
f (t  tf )

q1 + 2a2

, (f ) =

1

af hq1 + 2a2

f (tf  ti)  1i

.

(33)

consequently, for all non vanishing positive values of the parameter a, this choice leads to a non
admissible gauge xing of the system. indeed, as f runs from  to +, the associated domain
in teichmuller space reduces to the nite interval d[f ] = [q2(tf  ti)/a,q2(tf  ti)/a] with

a single covering. in other words, even though it does not suer a local gribov problem, this
gauge xing is non admissible since it suers a global one. nevertheless, in the the limit where
the parameter a vanishes, the admissible gauge xing implied by f () = 0 is indeed recovered.
incidentally, note that even already at the classical level, these simple examples illustrate
the general fact that the gauge invariant physics described by gauge invariant systems is not
independent of the gauge xing procedure to which they are subjected[3, 12], contrary to what
seems to be generally believed to be true. gauge invariance of physical quantities is not all there
is to gauge invariant systems; it is also imperative that the actual space of gauge orbits of the
system be properly accounted for by any description based on some gauge xing procedure. this
can only be achieved through an admissible gauge xing, even though any gauge xing procedure,
including those suering local or global gribov problems, always leads to gauge invariant results
for physical observables.

3 dirac quantisation

diracs quantisation of the model simply consists in the canonical quantisation of the previous
hamiltonian formulation of the system, with the constraint of gauge invariance  = 0 imposed
at the operatorial level in order to dene physical, i.e. gauge invariant states. for convenience,
we choose to work in the polar parametrisation (r, , z) of the degrees of freedom of the system,
which thus requires the construction of representations of the associated heisenberg algebra in
these curvilinear coordinates parametrising the three dimensional euclidean space dened by
the cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). moreover, given our intent of computing the propagator of
physical states, we shall consider from the outset the conguration space representation of the
canonical commutation relations in polar coordinates.

for this purpose, we rely on the recent classication[10] of representations of the heisen-
berg algebra in arbitrary coordinate systems set up on arbitrary manifolds.
in the present
instance, since the euclidean space (x, y, z) is simply connected, only the trivial representation
of the heisenberg algebra exists, while the dierential operator representation of the conjugate
momenta operators pr, p and pz is determined by the metric structure of this conguration
space, expressed in polar coordinates by

ds2 = dr2 + r2d2 + dz2

.

(34)

consequently[10], the conguration space wave function inner product is dened by the integra-
tion measure

z +

0

dr r z 2

0

d z +



dz

,

(35)

(36)

while the conjugate momenta operators are represented by the dierential operators,

pr : 

rr

ih
r

;

p : ih

;

pz : ihz

,

the coordinate operators r,  and z being of course represented on conguration space wave
functions through simple multiplication by the associated eigenvalues r,  and z.

this does not yet specify the choice of quantum hamiltonian for the system, in corres-
pondence with the classical rst-class hamiltonian h in (19). however, the canonical choice
corresponding to the usual scalar laplacian dierential operator, is dened by[10]

h =

(37)

which, in terms of the above representation of the conjugate momenta operators, also reads,

finally, the gauge generator operator  = pz + g p is thus also represented by

 : ih (z + g)

.

(38)

(39)

in particular, by denition, the conguration space wave functions of gauge invariant states are
annihilated by this latter dierential operator.

let us rst consider the diagonalisation of the rst-class hamiltonian h, whose set of
eigenstates thus denes a basis for the full space of quantum states of the system, of which a
specic linear subspace is that of the gauge invariant physical states annihilated by the gauge
generator . in the same manner as at the classical level, since h, p and pz are all commuting

9

operators, a common diagonalisation of all these three operators may be found, thereby also
diagonalising the gauge generator . thus, a basis for the physical states of the system is
dened by the specic subset of this diagonalising basis of states whose  eigenvalue vanishes
identically.

with these considerations in mind, the resolution of the schrodinger equation

is straightforward enough. the eigenvalue spectrum is given by

(40)

(41)

em,,p =

1
2

p2 + hh2m + || + 1i

,

with  < p < +, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . and  = 0,1,2, . . ., while the corresponding eigenstate
conguration space wave functions are

m,,p(r, , z) =< r, , z|m, , p >=
2h(cid:19)1/2 (cid:18) m!

(m + ||)!(cid:19)1/2

h(cid:19)1/2 (cid:18) 1

= (1)m (cid:18) 
where l||
m (x) are the usual laguerre polynomials, the variable u is dened by u = rp/h and
the choice of overall phase (1)m is made for later convenience. the normalisation of these
states is such that
(43)

ei eipz/h u|| eu2/2 l||

m (u2)

< m, , p|m, , p >= mm  (p  p)

(42)

.

,

in particular, a basis for the physical states of the model is provided by these wave functions

with the further restriction that their  eigenvalue vanishes, namely

p = hg

.

(44)

note that the dependency of the associated wave functions on the gauge variant variables 
and z does combine into a single phase dependency on the specic gauge invariant combination
 =   gz, namely with the following recombination of phase factors

ei eipz/h  ei(gz) = ei

,

(45)

as was indeed expected.

this explicit resolution of the quantised model may of course also be achieved through
algebraic methods[5, 9]. for that purpose, it is more appropriate to consider rst the cartesian
parametrisation of its degrees of freedom (x, y, z), and the denition of the usual creation and
annihilation operators (only the latter are recalled here),

a1 = r 

2h(cid:20)x +

i


px(cid:21)

,

a2 = r 

2h (cid:20)y +

i


py(cid:21)

.

(46)

however, rotational invariance of the model in the (x, y) plane calls for the introduction of an
helicity-like basis of creation and annihilation operators, dened by[9],

a =

1
2

[a1  ia2]

,

a
 =

1

2ha

2i
1  ia

.

(47)

in term of these quantities, the rst-class hamiltonian and the gauge generator read,

h =

1
2

p2

z + hha

+a+ + a

ai

 = pz + hgha

+a+  a

ai

.

(48)

,

10

hence, the orthonormalised helicity fock state basis, extended here to pz momentum eigenstates
and dened by

1

+(cid:17)n+ (cid:16)a

(cid:17)n

pn+! n! (cid:16)a
pz|0, p >= p|0, p > , < 0, p|0, p >= (p  p)

|0, p > ,

(49)

,

(50)

|n, p >=

and with the fock vacuum |0, p > being such that

a |0, p >= 0 ,

provides a direct diagonalisation both of the hamiltonian h and of the gauge generator . the
energy spectrum is thus

h|n, p >= en,p |n, p > , en,p =

1
2

p2 + h (n+ + n + 1)

,

(51)

while the physical state condition  = 0 leads to the restriction

p = hg (n+  n)

.

(52)

to establish complete identity with the previous results, one only needs now to deter-
mine the conguration space wave function representation of the states |n, p >. this is a
straightforward exercise using the dierential operator representations of the operators pr and
p introduced previously. one then nds[5] precisely the same wave functions as those given in
(42), with the following correspondence

< r, , z|n, p >= m,,p(r, , z)

, m = min(n+, n)

,

 = n+  n .

(53)

since the rst-class hamiltonian commutes with the gauge generator, any physical state
retains this quality under time evolution generated by the evolution operator of the system given
by the time-ordered expression

u (tf , ti) = t e

 i

ti

hr tf

dt [ h+(t) ]

,

(54)

where (t) stands for an arbitrary choice of lagrange multiplier. nevertheless, this fact does not
allow a direct evaluation of the conguration space matrix elements of the evolution operator
to which only physical states would contribute as intermediate states, since conguration space
eigenstates |r, , z > do not dene gauge invariant states. hence, it appears that in order to
evaluate the conguration space propagator of the system restricted to gauge invariant states
only, one needs rst to implement some gauge xing procedure by which the contributions from
all gauge variant variables are removed, while retaining only those of the physical states. the
calculation of this physical state propagator through gauge xing is the purpose of the next
two sections, before showing in sect.6 how the same goal may readily be reached by using the
physical projector[6] simply within diracs quantisation of the system which does not require
any gauge xing whatsoever.

4 reduced phase space quantisation

in this section, we consider faddeevs reduced phase space formulation[3] of the model given
the gauge xing condition z(t) = 0, to which the choice of boundary conditions (8) thus applies.
as was discussed previously, we know that this choice of gauge xing is admissible7. hence,
the canonical quantisation of the corresponding hamiltonian formulation should allow for the
7other reduced phase space gauge xings, such as z(t)  x(t) = 0 with  a xed postive parameter, are

discussed in ref.[5].

11

calculation of the physical propagator of the system, to which all gauge orbits of the model
contribute once and only once.

together with the rst-class generator  = pz +gp of the u(1) gauge symmetry, the gauge

xing condition

 = z = 0 ,

(55)

does dene a set of second-class constraints, whose faddeev-popov determinant does not vanish,

{, } = 1 .

(56)

in particular, the requirement that the gauge xing condition  = 0 be maintained under time
evolution generated by the total hamiltonian ht = h + , namely  = 0, implies the following
specication of the lagrange multiplier,

hence, given the fact that p(t) keeps a constant value l for solutions to the equations of motion,
the associated teichmuller parameter

 = pz = gp

.

(57)

 = z tf

ti

dt (t) = gl(tf  ti)

,

(58)

does indeed obey the constraint (28) set by the boundary conditions (8). of course, the fact
that this constraint is met is a consequence of the admissibility of the gauge xing condition
z(t) = 0.

the reduction of the system, and in particular the decoupling of the (z, pz) sector of phase

space degrees of freedom through the relations

z = 0 ,

pz = gp

,

(59)

necessitates the calculation of the dirac brackets associated to the second-class constraints (, ).
one easily nds that the dirac brackets among the remaining phase space conjugate pairs (r, pr)
and (, p) are identical to their original poisson brackets. in addition, the reduced hamiltonian
appropriate to this reduced phase space formulation of the model is given by

hred =

1
2

p2
r +

1

2 (cid:20) 1
r2 + g2(cid:21) p2

 +

2r2

.

1
2

(60)

in particular, the corresponding equations of motion,

r = pr

,

pr =

1
r3 p2

  2r

;

 = (cid:18) 1

r2 + g2(cid:19) p

,

p = 0

,

(61)

coincide with those obtained from the original equations of motion (23) in which the relations
z = 0, pz = gp and  = pz = gp are being substituted.

the canonical quantisation of this formulation of the model in polar coordinates is straight-
forward enough, since it coincides with that of the (r, ) sector in diracs quantisation. hence,
we may immediately transcribe the corresponding conguration space representations of quan-
tum operators. in particular, a basis of the quantum space of states, which are now necessarily
all gauge invariant ones, is provided by those states which diagonalise both the angular momen-
tum operator p = ih and the schrodinger operator associated to the reduced hamiltonian
above, namely,

(62)

12

the explicit resolution of this equation shows that the eigenvalue spectrum is given by

em, =

1
2

h2g22 + hh2m + || + 1i

,

(63)

with m = 0, 1, 2, . . . and  = 0,1,2, . . ., while the corresponding eigenstate conguration
space wave functions are

m,(r, ) =< r, |m,  >= (1)m (cid:18) 

h(cid:19)1/2 (cid:18) m!

(m + ||)!(cid:19)1/2

ei u|| eu2/2 l||

m (u2)

,

(64)

with the same notations as in (42) and a normalisation such that

< m, |m,  >= mm 

.

(65)

except for the normalisation factor 1/(2h)1/2 stemming from the (z, pz) sector which has been
reduced in the present approach, this energy spectrum as well as these wave functions coincide
with those established for physical states in diracs quantisation (recall that we have here z = 0
so that  =   gz = ).

the calculation of the physical propagator is now immediate. since it is dened by the

matrix elements

we explicitely have

pred(i  f ) =< rf , f|e i

h (tf ti) hred|ri, i > ,

pred(i  f ) =

+

xm=0

+

x=

< rf , f|m,  > e i

h (tf ti)em, < m, |ri, i > .

(66)

(67)

given the wave functions established above, the summation over the integer m is possible in
terms of bessel functions of the rst kind, leading nally to the following expression for the
conguration space propagator of physical states8,

where t = tf  ti. this latter result will thus serve as the point of comparison for the physical
propagator obtained through the other two quantisation approaches considered in this paper,
namely the so-called bfv-brst invariant formulation of gauge invariant systems, and the
physical projector construction of ref.[6].

5 bfv-brst quantisation

as opposed to the reduced phase space approach, the bfv-brst one[3] extends the set of
dynamical degrees of freedom in the following manner. first, the lagrange multiplier (t) is
promoted to being a dynamical variable by introducing its conjugate momentum p(t), thereby
leading now to two rst-class constraints

ga=1 = p = 0 , ga=2 =  = pz + gp = 0 .

note that we still have

{ga, gb} = 0 ,

{h, ga} = 0 ,

a, b = 1, 2

.

8had the factor exp(cid:0)ihtg22/2(cid:1) been absent from this expression, the summation over  would have been

possible as well[10], leading of course to the usual propagator for the two dimensional spherically symmetric
harmonic oscillator of angular frequency  and unit mass m = 1.

(69)

(70)

13

next, in order to compensate for these additional degrees of freedom, further dynamical
variables of opposite grassmann parity are introduced, the bfv ghosts a(t) and pa(t), (a =
1, 2), each such pair being canonically conjugate variables with graded poisson brackets

in addition, the bfv ghosts have the following properties under complex conjugation,

{a,pb} = a

b

,

a, b = 1, 2

.

(a) = a

,

(pa) = pa

,

a = 1, 2

.

(71)

(72)

within this framework, the original hamiltonian gauge invariance generated by the rst-
class constraint  = g2 is now traded for a global brst symmetry generated by the grassmann
odd brst charge qb, which for the present model is given by

qb = a ga = 1 p + 2 [pz + gp]

,

(73)

and is characterised by the nilpotency property {qb, qb} = 0 as well as being real under
complex conjugation, (qb) = qb.

similarly, the original rst-class hamiltonian h may also be extended to a brst invariant
one, hb, which in the present case is identical to h, hb = h. however, in the same way that
the time evolution of the system in diracs construction is generated by the hamiltonian h to
which an arbitrary linear combination of the rst-class constraints is added, here as well time
evolution in this extended phase space description of the system is generated by the most general
possible brst invariant hamiltonian based on hb, given by

he = hb  {, qb}

.

(74)

here,  is a priori a totally arbitrary function on the extended phase space, of grassmann odd
parity and odd under complex conjugation, while the nilpotency property of the brst charge
ensures that

{he , qb} = 0 .

(75)

given any choice for the function , the equations of motion of the system within this
in order to construct gauge invariant solutions
extended framework are easily established.
however, it is imperative to impose brst invariant boundary conditions which extend the
choice considered previously in (9). a general discussion[3] shows that the following conditions
always meet this requirement of brst invariance,

p(ti) = 0 , p1(ti) = 0 , 2(ti) = 0 ; p(tf ) = 0 , p1(tf ) = 0 , 2(tf ) = 0 ,

(76)

a fact which in the present case is explicitely conrmed by considering the brst transformations
of the extended phase space variables,

br = {r, qb} = 0 , bpr = 0 ; b = g2 , bp = 0 ; bz = 2 , bpz = 0 ;
b = 1 , bp = 0 ; b1 = 0 , bp1 = p ; b2 = 0 , bp2 =  [pz + gp] .
in the remainder of this section, we shall consider the specic choice[3]

 = f ()p1 + p2

,

(77)

(78)

where f () is an arbitrary function. the corresponding eective hamiltonian is then

he =

,

(79)

14

from which it is possible to derive the equations of motion for all the extended phase space
variables (r, pr), (, p), (z, pz), (, p) and (a,pa). among these equations, the one for the
lagrange multiplier is simply
(80)

 = f ()

.

in other words, within the bfv-brst framework, the function  provides the gauge xing
fermion function, which for the choice in (78) implies a gauge xing of the system in its space
of lagrange multiplier functions (t) precisely of the type discussed in (29), for which admissible
and non admissible examples were described.

rather than considering now the construction of the general solution to these equations of
motion at the classical level, let us turn immediately to the brst quantisation of the system.
through the redenitions

a = 1, 2

,

(ca)2 = 0 ,

(ba)2 = 0 , ca = ca , b

a = ba , a, b = 1, 2 ,

(82)

thus dening the usual so-called (b, c) ghost system whose representation theory is straightfor-
ward and well known[3]. further, the denitions of the brst and gauge xing fermion operators,
qb and , read as those at the classical level above, while the brst invariant eective quantum
hamiltonian operator he is now given by,

he = h +

i
h{ , qb} ,

(83)

where the choice of normal ordering in the p2

we are now in a position to compute the physical propagator of the system, namely the

matrix elements of the brst invariant evolution operator

ubrst(tf , ti) = e i

h t he

,

(85)

for the brst invariant external states of the quantised system which correspond to the choice
of brst invariant boundary conditions in (9) and (76). however, since the extended sectors of
variables (, p) and (a,pa) as well as the structure of the hamiltonian gauge algebras of the
present model and of the parametrised relativistic scalar particle are identical, only the outline
of the calculation will be discussed here, whose complete details are thoroughly presented in
ref.[3] for the latter system. in particular, for reasons presented in that work, the calculation of
the matrix elements we are interested in, is best performed using the path integral representation
over the bfv extended phase space. the construction of a discretized but exact expression for
that path integral proceeds in the usual fashion, by considering the (n  1)-times insertion of
the spectral decomposition of the identity operator on the space of quantum states between the
n factors appearing in the following rewriting of the evolution operator,

ubrst(tf , ti) = he i

h  hein

,

 =

=

.

(86)

using wave function representations for the position and momentum eigenstates associated to
all extended phase space operators (r, pr), (, p), (z, pz), (, p) and (a, pa), this procedure

15

leads to a discretized representation of the extended phase space path integral associated to the
relevant matrix element of the brst invariant evolution operator in conguration space (further
details are found in ref.[3]). in particular, the ghost sector is represented in terms of grassmann
odd variables, whose integration then combines with that over the lagrange multiplier sector
(, p) and may be completed exactly.

having performed the integrations over the extended sector of degrees of freedom (, p)
and (a,pa), the path integral representation of the brst invariant physical propagator reads9,

(89)

hence, in the limit n  , the extended sector of variables (, p) and (a,pa) does again
lead to the gauge xing of the system implied by the dierential equation (29) and the function
f (). in that limit, as a consequence of the brst invariance of the quantity being computed, the
integration over that sector does indeed lead to an integral over teichmuller space parametrised
by the parameter  and with the measure d/(2h), but over a domain d[f ] determined from
the dierential equation d/dt = f () and the boundary value f = (tf ) precisely in the
manner discussed in sect.2. thus, even though the quantity of interested is brst and gauge
invariant, and thus dened over teichmuller space rather than the space of lagrange multiplier
functions (t), nevertheless this gauge invariant quantity is not independent of the gauge xing
procedure[3, 12]. indeed, as the examples of sect.2 have illustrated, the domain d[f ] obtained
through the classes of gauge xings implied by the choice (29) is dependent both on the type
of function f () and on the parameters dening that function. once again, gauge invariance of
physical observables is not all there is to gauge invariant systems.

9compared to ref.[3], the only dierence is that the (r, ) sector is that of curvilinear coordinates in an
euclidean space, for which the considerations developed in ref.[10] must be applied. this is the reason for the
factor 1/rf ri in front of this expression, while the phase i stems from the inner product in the (ca, ba) ghost
sectors[3].

16

however, the integration over the radial variable r is precisely that which appears in
the path integral calculation of the propagator of the two dimensional spherically symmetric
harmonic oscillator. using the techniques developed in ref.[13], one then nally obtains

in order to reduce further this latter result and compare it to the exact expression (68)
obtained for the admissible gauge xing z(t) = 0, it should be clear that a choice for the function
f () must be made such that the corresponding gauge xing is also admissible, thereby leading
to the domain d[f ] being the entire real line. for any non admissible choice for f (), the
associated domain d[f ] would not be the entire techmuller space of the system, and the nal
result obtained for the nevertheless gauge invariant quantity p [f ]
brst (i  f ) would not represent
the correct expression (68) for the physical propagator of gauge invariant states of the model10.
thus assuming now that the function f () denes an admissible gauge xing of the sys-
tem11with the meaning dened in the introduction, it is clear that nally, the exact eval-
uation of the exact path integral representation of the brst invariant propagator leads to the
expression

in which we have used the denitions i,f = i,f  gzi,f of the gauge invariant combinations
of the boundary conditions, which indeed appear in this expression as initially expected for a
gauge invariant quantity.

quite clearly, except for the overall normalisation factor i/(2h) stemming from the quan-
tum dynamics of the extended sector of variables (, p) and (a,pa) in the bfv-brst invariant
framework, the nal result in (92) valid only for an admissible gauge xing coincides exactly with
the exact result in (68) obtained within the reduced phase space approach based on the admis-
sible gauge xing condition z(t) = 0 for the same physical propagator of the quantised model.
in particular, this conclusion provides an explicit demonstration of the well known fact that the
extended sector of lagrange multiplier and ghost degrees of freedom of opposite grassmann pa-
rities, precisely cancels out the contributions of the gauge variant states to the matrix elements
of physical observables, while only those contributions of physical states are retained.

10for example, with the choice f () = a3, the nal result for the brst invariant propagator would depend
on the parameter a dening the gauge xing condition, and only in the limit a  0 would the admissible result
be recovered. nevertheless, by construction, p [f ]
brst(i  f ) is gauge invariant whatever the value for a, since the
bfv-brst path integral is gauge invariant independently of the choice for f ().

11such as for example f () = a + b.

6 the physical projector

the previous two sections have demonstrated how through a rather involved process of gauge
xing requiring a careful analysis of the possible gribov problems which may thereby ensue, the
conguration space propagator of the physical states of the quantised system may be obtained,
but with an expression which is physically correct only for an admissible choice of gauge xing
free of any local or global gribov ambiguity. both approaches rely rst on diracs hamiltonian
formulation of constrained systems, which is then either reduced or extended before the quantum
dynamics of the system is considered.

the purpose of this section is to illustrate that all these complications may be avoided
altogether, without the necessity of any gauge xing whatsoever, by working immediately within
diracs quantisation of constrained systems and exploiting the construction of the physical pro-
jector onto gauge invariant states introduced in ref.[6]. in particular, we shall reconsider once
again the calculation of the physical propagator for the choice of boundary conditions (9), to
explicitely establish that the correct result (68) is indeed readily derived using such an approach.
this analysis only requires the results of diracs quantisation derived in sect.3.

in that section, it was shown that the spectrum of the u(1) gauge symmetry generator 

is given by

 : p + hg

,  < p < + ,  = 0,1,2, . . .

.

(93)

this spectrum being continuousdue to the non compact component of the gauge symmetry
group related to the translations in the variable z which it induces, the actual denition of
the projection operator onto physical states annihilated by the operator  requires[6] to consider
a nite eigenvalue interval [, ], with a positive quantity  taken as small as is wished. the
projection operator onto  eigenstates whose eigenvalue lies within that interval is then given
by[6]

ei  = z +



d

sin(/h)



i

h  

e

.

(94)

considering then the quantum evolution operator (54) in diracs quantisation, its projec-

tion onto contributions from physical states only is dened by

uphys(tf , ti) = lim
0

h


u (tf , ti) ei  = lim
0

h


e i

h t h ei 

,

(95)

where h is the rst-class quantum hamiltonian of the system. note that since h and  commute,
one may also write

e i

h t h ei  = ei  e i

h t ei  hei  ei 

,

(96)

in order to emphasize the fact that indeed only physical states contribute to the physical evolu-
tion operator uphys(tf , ti), both as intermediate and as external states, in the limit   0.
element12,

hence, the conguration space physical propagator is simply given by the following matrix

pproj (i  f ) =< rf , f , zf| uphys(ti, tf )|ri, i, zi > ,

(97)

whose explicit evaluation only requires the wave functions of a complete basis of all quantum
states of the systemincluding the non physical onesconstructed in (42). since this basis
diagonalises both the hamiltonian h and the generator , the calculation is rather straightfor-
ward and follows much the same lines as the one in sect.4 for the summation over the integer
m associated to the (r, ) sector of degrees of freedom. the additional contributions from the z
sector are easily included, since the projector ei  implies the constraint p + hg = 0 through a
(p + hg) function in the limit   0.
12the coherent state matrix elements of the same operator have been considered in ref.[6].

18

to explicitely illustrate how the contributions of gauge variant states as intermediate states
are indeed projected out from the physical propagator, let us consider the expression for (97)
when the complete set of eigenstate conguration space wave functions (42) is substituted for,

pproj (i  f ) =

+

xm=0

+

x=z +



dp m,,p(rf , f , zf )

h t[ 1

 e i

2 p2+h(2m+||+1)] z +



i

d e

h (p+hg) 

m,,p(ri, i, zi)

.

(98)

in this form, it is clear that the integration over the teichmuller parameter  enforces the gauge
invariance constraint through the factor 2h(p + hg). from this contribution, the numerical
factor 2h cancels precisely the factor 1/(2h) which stems from the normalisation of the wave
functions (42) in the (z, pz) sector of degrees of freedom, while the (p+hg) function implies that
only those states for which p = hg, namely physical states, are retained in the summation
over the integers m and  and the integration over the conserved momentum p. hence, the
physical projector, leading to an integration over teichmuller space, does indeed project out the
contributions of the gauge variant states of the quantised system; only physical states contribute
as intermediate states to the physical propagator, all and every single one of them contributing
with the same multiplicity of unity.

the remainder of the calculation is then identical to that which leads to the result (68)
established in the reduced phase space approach. indeed, the summation over the integers m and
 is that already performed in that case, with an identical normalisation of the wave functions
in the (r, ) sector of degrees of freedom. hence, a direct enough and exact calculation readily
provides the following nal expression for the physical propagator within the physical projector
approach,

a result which coincides exactly with those in (68) and (92) established on the basis of some
gauge xing procedure whose admissibility must be ascertained with great care, and by using
methods going beyond the simpler framework of diracs quantisation of constrained systems.

as it should, the physical projector has thus achieved the required projecting out of the
contributions of the gauge variant states to the physical propagator, independently of any gauge
xing procedure and thereby avoiding any potential gribov problem. with hindsight, the result
(99) could have been obtained straighforwardly already in sect.3 within diracs quantisation of
the system[8], by restricting by hand so to say, the summation in (98) over the intermediate
states contributing to the evolution operator (54) to the subspace of the physical states only,
namely

(100)

a relation in which the energy spectrum of gauge invariant states is also accounted for. except for
an overall normalisation factor of 1/(2h) stemming from the (z, pz) sector of degrees of freedom,
quite obviously the same result as those established above for the physical propagator is obtained.
nevertheless, for systems not as simple as the present one, such a direct restriction to physical
state contributions only is not expected to be feasable by hand in such a straightforward way
within diracs quantisation, while the physical projector which nds its rightful setting within
that very same framework, is in general the appropriate tool for that purpose which is then
achieved directly albeit often implicitely.

7 conclusions

using the simple but yet rich enough solvable u(1) gauge invariant quantum mechanical model
of ref.[5], this work has demonstrated the clear advantages of using the physical projector[6] in
the quantisation of gauge invariant systems. indeed, by its very denition, the physical projector
avoids the apparent necessity of some gauge xing procedure, which most often is at the origin
of local and global gribov problems rendering the associated gauge invariant description of a
given system physically in- or over-complete. moreover, all methods of gauge xing require
an approach going beyond the original dirac hamiltonian framework for constrained systems,
within which however, the physical projector nds its rightful setting.

as the present paper has clearly illustrated, the physical projector naturally avoids all
the complications inherent to any gauge xing procedure, both through the automatic lack of
any gribov problem and by the absence of any further developments beyond those required in
any case by diracs approach. in addition, the physical projector induces implicitely the correct
integration of all gauge orbits of a gauge invariant system[7], by eectively accounting for the
contributions to the dynamics of the systembe it classical or quantumof each one of all the
gauge orbits once and only once, the very fact which characterizes precisely what should dene
an admissible gauge xing procedure when one is being implemented.

in particular, by considering the explicit calculation of the physical propagator, it was
clearly demonstrated how the physical projector automatically enforces the fact that only gauge
invariant physical states contribute to that observable as intermediate states, the contributions
of the gauge variant states being simply projected out. within the other approaches to the
quantisation of gauge invariant systems, which all require some gauge xing procedure and are
thus potentially plagued by gribov problems, the cancellation of the gauge variant contributions
is achieved either by having only gauge invariant congurations to survive the phase space
reduction, or by having an extended sector of ghost degrees of freedom to compensate for the
contributions of gauge variant congurations.
it is only for an admissible gauge xing that
this cancellation of gauge variant contributions is correctly achieved, a feature which is directly
though implicitely realised within the physical projector approach given the very character of
the latter operator.

quite obviously, the diverse advantages of the physical projector in a gauge xing free
quantisation of gauge invariant systems are there to be explored much further for systems whose
dynamics is not as simple as that of the model used in this paper, beginning for example with
yang-mills theory in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, or topological quantum eld theories[14]. and
beyond such applications, it may hoped that this approach to the quantisation of gauge invariant
systems will provide new insights[15] into the mathematical and physical riches of the actual
gauge theories of the fundamental interactions.
