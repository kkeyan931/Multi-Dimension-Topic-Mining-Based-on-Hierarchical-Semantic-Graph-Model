abstract

we propose a new star pruduct which interpolates the berezin and moyal quantization. a

multiple of this product is shown to reduce to a path-integral quantization in the continuous time

limit. in at space the action becomes the one of free bosonic strings. relation to kontsevich

prescription is also discussed.

1 introduction

since the discovery of planck constant h, the concept of quantization has been a central

subject to study in physics during the last 100 years. the recent revival of the study

of quantization in theoretical physics and in mathematics is aimed to quantize the base

manifold, i.e., the space-time itself[1]. from the view point of physics it must be founded

in order to unify the theory of gravity into quantum (or gauge) eld theory. it seems

commonly understood that some new mathematics must be incorporated for the quanti-

zation of space-time to be established. there exist various methods of quantization which

have been developed during 20th century. in order to understand the fundamental role of

quantization in the new developement it will be useful to clarify relations among methods

of quantization.

it has been well known for some years that certain topological quantum eld the-

ories with chern-simons action can be considered within the framework of geometric

quantization[2]. the geometric quantization method[3][4][5][6] has been reformulated in

terms of path-integral method[7], from which conformal eld theories are deduced. all

these show that the geometric quantization is an important key word to understand inte-

grable quantum eld theory.

besides the study of geometric quantization in eld theory, there have been proposed

direct methods of quantization. among various deformation quantizations, the quantiza-

tion of classical phase space using moyal star product[8] is the one which has been well

studied[9],[10], but is applicable only to at phase space. berezin quantization is another

method which works in certain kahler manifolds[11][12]. the corresponding star product

is given by involution of symbols associated with physical observables.

a constructive method of geometric quantization was proposed by kontsevich[13].

it provides a systematic way to nd coecients of the expansion of the star product

in powers of a deformation parameter. subsequently this expansion was shown to be

described in terms of path-integral of certain nonlinear sigma model[14][15]. more recently

berezin quantization was generalized to work for an arbitrary kahler manifold and an

interpretation of the deformation was given in the language of feynman diagrams[16].

despite of many proposal of quantization methods, we are still far from understanding

the real meaning of quantization from both physical and mathematical point of view. in

particular relations between dierent methods are not obvious. for example all methods

should be locally equivalent to the at space quantization. the proof of this in the case

of quantization of sphere a l`a berezin was given only recently[17]. the path-integral

interpretation of the geometric quantization is quite interesting and has attracted many

authors.

it does not ll, however, the gap between the local nature of quantization

and global nature of correlation functions, in spite of desire to provide a mathematical

foundation of the path-integral quantization.

the aim of this paper is to clarify this point by introducing a new star product
f  g. we adopt the spirit of berezin quantization. at the same time we require that
it turns to the moyal bracket in a at space, and reduces directly to a poisson bracket

in classical limit. we recall the fact that only the dierence of the berezin star product
(f b g  g b f ) reproduces the poisson bracket in the small parameter limit, while the
moyal star product f m g itself does. this dierence made dicult to argue these two
methods of quantization in equal footing for a long time. therefore it is highly nontrivial

to incorporate the two requirements simultaneously.

a multiple of this new product will be shown to reduce to a path-integral quantization

2

in the continuous time limit. this explains the missing link between the naive concept of

quantization and the intuitive construction of feynman path-integral.

our star product does not show associativity in a manifest form, if it is not dened

on a at space. nevertheless we can show that it plays the role of time ordered product,

which is another important ingredient of eld theory. the product becomes manifestly

associative if we consider the path-integral representation of the product dened along

a closed loop. in a at space the action becomes one of free strings and associativity is

satised as a result of duality of old string theory. the noncommutativity in string theory

has its origin in the nature of moyal star product[18]. since our formalism of quantization

is applicable to some kahler manifolds, it generalizes the ordinary at-space string theory.

by the same reason we are able to make a correspondence of our method of quantization

to the one of kontsevich[13].

2 moyal vs berezin star products

to begin with we consider the simplest case of moyal star product:

ei(mx+np) m ei(mx+np)

:= ei(x pxp )ei(mx+np)ei(mx+np)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=x,p=p

mn)ei(mx+np)ei(mx+np)

= ei(mn

(1)

where  is a deformation parameter. notice that the right hand side admits the following

integral representation:

= z d d 

2 z dd

2

ei( )/ei[x()p( )]/ei(m +n)ei(m+n).

(2)

this information is sucient to derive an integral representation of the moyal star product

of arbitrary functions which can be expanded into fourier series.

in fact we nd the

following expression:

(f m g)(x, p) = z d d 

2 z dd

2

ei( )/ei[x()p( )]/f ( ,  )g(, ).

(3)

in order to establish the correspondence between the moyal star product and the

berezin form of quantization, let us rewrite above formulae in terms of complex variables

dened by

a = (x + ip)/2,

a = (x  ip)/2,
v = ( + i)/2,

b = (n  im)/2,
v = (  i)/2.

3

b = (n + im)/2,

(4)

then (3) is equivalent to

(f m g)(a, a) = z dvdv

2i z dudu

2i

e(vvvaav)/
e(uuuaau)/ f (u, v)g(v, u).

(5)

here we denote by f (a, a) the same function as f (x, p) but written in terms of the new

variables. we also notice that the moyal star product can be splitted into two parts:

(f st g)(a, a) := ea af (a, a)g(a, a) = z dvdv
(f ar g)(a, a) := eaa f (a, a)g(a, a) = z dudu

2i

2i

e(vvvaav+aa)/ f (a, v)g(v, a),

(6)

e(uuuaau+aa)/ f (u, a)g(a, u).

(7)

we are now going to compare (5) with berezin star product. according to berezin[11]
we introduce a supercomplete set of state vectors ek(a,a). here k(a, a) is a function

dened by an analytic continuation of the kahler potential k(a, a) of the manifold in our

concern. a multiplication law of covariant symbols is given by

(f b g)(a, a) := z d(v, v)e(v,v,a,a)/f (a, v)g(v, a),

where d(v, v) is the measure of integration and  is the calabi function dened by

(v, v, a, a) := k(v, v) + k(v, a) + k(a, v)  k(a, a).

(8)

(9)

in a at space the kahler potential is k(a, a) = aa. the b product (8) does not reduce
to the moyal star product (5) in the at space, but does to the half star product (6). in

fact the berezin star product was designed so that the  expansion of the commutator
(f b g  g b f ) yields the poisson bracket in the leading term, whereas the moyal
product (3) contains the poisson bracket in it.

3 new star product

now we would like to propose a new star product , which lls the dierence between the
moyal and berezin star products :

(f  g)(a, a) := z d(v, v)z d(u, u)

e(v,v,a,a)/
e(u,u,a,a)/ f (u, v)g(v, u).

(10)

note that this single product  reduces to the moyal star product m of (5) in the case
of at space.

it is straightforward to see associativity of the berezin star product (8):

(f b g) b h = f b (g b h).

(11)

4

in the case of our new product we have

(f  (g  h))(a, a)

= z d(v , )z d(, v )z d(v , v)z d(v, v )

f (v , v )g(v , v )h(v, v)

e(a,a,,v)/
e(a,a,v, )/

e(, ,v,v)/
e(, ,v,v)/

and

((f  g)  h)(a, a)

= z d(v , v )z d(v , v )z d(, v)z d(v, )

f (v , v )g(v , v )h(v, v)

e(v,v,, )/
e(v,v,, )/

e(v, ,a,a)/
e(,v,a,a)/

(12)

(13)

which do not show associativity in an obvious manner. if the space is at the integrations
over  and  yield dirac -functions. after some manipulation we nd that

= z dv dv 

(f m (g m h))(a, a)
2i z dv dv 
 e(vv v v)/eav va(a  v  + v   v)(a  v  + v   v).

2i z dvdv

f (v , v )g(v , v )h(v, v)

2i

and

((f m g) m h)(a, a)
= z dv dv 
2i z dv dv 
 e(v v

2i z dvdv
v v)/evaav(a  v  + v   v)(a  v  + v   v).

f (v , v )g(v , v )h(v, v)

2i

(14)

(15)

coincide with each other, hence the associativity is fullled.

in case of general kahler

manifold the  integration is not trivially done and the symmetry is not known.

4 path-integral via multiple star products

although we are not able to show the equivalence of (12) and (13) manifestly, we would

like to show, in the following, that we can dene properly the ordered multiple products,

which turn out to be state functions in path-integral representation in the continuous

time limit.

let us call the multiple product

n

abb

(a, a) := (cid:16)eab(n+1)b(n+1)a      (cid:16)eab(2) b(2)a  (cid:16)eab(1) b(1)a  eab(0) b(0)a(cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:17) ,

(16)

5

the forward product. using the denition of the product repeatedly we obtain

d((j1), x (j))d(x (j), (j1))


n +1

n +1

yj=1

e(x(j)b(j)b(j) x(j))

e((j), (j),(j1), x(j))/

e((j), (j),x(j), (j1))/


(17)

= z

n +1

yj=1


yj=0

where we put (0) := x (0), (n +1) := a.

now suppose that the sequence of the product becomes innitly large, so that j turns

to a continuous variable  . in this limit we have

ab,b(a, a) = z d(, x)d(x, ) eis/er t

0

(xbb x)d ,

where

d 
d 
and the canonical conjugate variables are dened by

d

s =

d
d

! ,

(18)

(19)

 :=

k(, )

 



k(x, )

 

,

 :=

k(, )





k(, x)



.

(20)

notice that in the expression of (18), we have put the boundary conditions (t) =
a, (t) = a.

similarly we dene the backward product

n

abb

(a, a) := (cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)eab(n+1) b(n+1)a  eab(n)b(n)a(cid:17)  eab(n 1) b(n 1)a(cid:17)      eab(0) b(0)a(cid:17) .

(21)

using (13) we obtain

d((j+1), x (j))d(x (j), (j+1))
yj=0


n +1

n

e(x(j)b(j)b(j) x(j))

e(x(j), (j+1),(j), (j))/

e((j+1), x(j),(j), (j))/


(22)

= z

n

yj=0


yj=0

where (0) = a, (n +1) = x (n +1). in the continuous time limit this is exactly the same

as the result of forward product (18), except for the boundary conditions which we must

impose (0) = a in the backward product, whereas we had put (t) = a in the forward

product.

the formulae we obtained provide us a natural interpretation of the products in terms

of path-integration. namely s is nothing but a kinetic action of path-integral quantiza-
tion. in the case of at space the integration over  and  can be performed in (18), and

6

we obtain a familiar path-integral representation of a free particle propagation:

ab,b(a, a) = z dxd x eis/er t

0

s =

5 associativity

i

2 z t

d x
d

.

(xbb x)d ,

(23)

(24)

we notice that the asymmetry between the forward multiple product ab,b(a, a) and the
one of backward multiple product ab,b(a, a) disappears if the path of integration over  is
closed to a loop and the condition (0) = (t) = a is imposed. knowing this information

we are now going to provide a star product which manifestly satises associativity.

so far we have not discussed the external source functions b(j). we can dene a gener-
ating functional by multiplying an arbitrary functional w(b, b) to abb(a, a) and integrating
over bs:

f (w; a, a) = z dbdb w(b, b)ab,b(a, a).

as an example we consider the case

w(b, b) = 

b( ) 

n +1

xj=0

b(j)(  j)
 
b( ) 


n +1

xj=0

b(j)(  j)
 ,

under the conditions (n +1) = (t) = a, (n +1) = (t) = a. we also x b(0) = b(0) =
b(n +1) = b(n +1) = 0. the substitution into (25) yields

f (b(1),    , b(n ); a, a) = za,a d(, x)d(x, ) eis/ exp
xj=1


n

(xj

where xj means the value of x( ) at  = j.

now suppose the path of integration over  is closed, that is

s =

1

i i d  

d 
d 

d
d

!

b(j)  b(j) xj)
 ,

(27)

(28)

in (27). we further assume (0) = (n +1) = a and (0) = (n +1) = a. then the result is
manifestly symmetric under the cyclic permutation of b(j)s. it is more convenient if we
multiply fourier components fj of a function fj and integrate over b(j)s, from which we
obtain

(fn o    of2 of1)(a, a)

fj(b(j), b(j))f (b(1),    , b(n ); a, a)

the rule of the ostar product is as follows:

fn o    o fr+1 o fr o    o f1 = (fn o    o fr+1) o (fr o    o f1)

(30)

where the loops of integration are dened as[19]

on the left and right hand sides, respectively. let us call this property of the ostar product

factorizability. this is the property which quarantees associativity of the product:

f o (g o h) = (f o g) o h.

(31)

kontsevich had proposed a constructive method of star product which works for arbi-

trary poisson manifold[13]. subsequently it was shown being equivalent to a path-integral

of a nonlinear sigma model[14]. we obtain a corresponding formula from (29) by restrict-

ing n = 2. generalization of our formulation to poisson manifold will be discussed

elsewhere.

6 correspondence to string models

all above discussions can be generalized to the case where several complex variables are

present. since a variable appears in a product with its canonical conjugate one, it amounts

to reinterprete the product by their inner product. if there are innitely many degrees of

freedom, they can be combined into an inner product of elds.

in order to illustrate the correspondence of our formulation to the string models dis-

cussed in early 70s[20], we concentrate our consideration to the case of at space. under

this circumstance the elds can be expanded into fourier series:

x () = x +

1
n



xn=1

x 
n ein, x () = p 

1
n



xn=1

x 

n ein.

(32)

the upper index  = 1, 2,    , d species the space time components. as we have discussed
previously the integration over x in the at space can be easily done and the canonical

8

conjugate of x () is nothing but x () itself. thus we nd



xn=0 xn

n! =

d  x()

(33)

and the action is one of the free bosonic strings:

s =

.

(34)

let us consider a compact domain d in the complex plane, whose boundary is given

by  = 0. instead of (, ) we use a complex coordinate z to specify a point on d. let
zj, j = 1, 2,    , n + 1 be n + 1 points on the boundary which are xed in this order
corresponding to  = 1, 2,    , n +1 and k
n be constant vectors associated
with 1    , n . if we substitute

which represents n-point open string correlation function with external momenta k

j s.
in these formulae we have xed three points, say z, z, z among zjs, and denoted by c

the following quantity:

c 1 :=

dzdzdz

(z  z)(z  z)(z  z)

,

(37)

so that the integrations over zjs are not over counted.
zn +1 = z0 being one of these three. since we assumed k
n +1 = 0, the dependence on
x (zn +1) = x (z0) = a is implicit. the three xed points (0, 1, ) which appear in the
kontsevich formulation are to be identied with these points.

in particular we can choose

in this paper we have shown that the path-integral formalism of quantization arizes

naturally starting from local concept of deformation quantization. the factorizability

(30) and the cyclic permutation symmetry were the properties which lead to the string

model of hadrons in 70s[21]. this fundamental nature was called duality. the moyal star

product (1) is equivalent to the product of vertices in operator formalism of strings. the

ostar product, which generalizes the moyal star product to non-at manifolds, preserves

this nature of duality.

9

the string correlation functions have been well studied and known to appear as so-

lutions to completely integrable systems, such as the hirota bilinear identity[22] or the

yang-baxter equation[23]. the duality has also relation to the pentagon equation[24].

therefore it will be interesting to see the corresponding relations satised by the correla-

tion functions dened using the new star product.
