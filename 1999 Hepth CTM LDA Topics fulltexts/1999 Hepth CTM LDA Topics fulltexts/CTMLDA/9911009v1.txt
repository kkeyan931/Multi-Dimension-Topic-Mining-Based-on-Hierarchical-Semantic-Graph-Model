the pp  00 puzzle

w. a. perkins

(perkins advanced computer systems) auburn, california

according to conventional theory, the annihilation reaction pp  00
cannot occur from a pp atomic s state. however, this reaction occurs so
readily for antiprotons stopping in liquid hydrogen, that it would require
30% p-wave annihilations. experimental results from other capture and pp
annihilation channels show that the fraction of p-wave annihilations is less
than 6% in agreement with theoretical expectations. an experimental test to
determine whether this reaction can occur from an atomic s state is suggested.
if indeed this reaction is occurring from an atomic s state, then certain neutral
vector mesons should exhibit a 00 decay mode, and this can also be tested
experimentally.

because of parity conservation and symmetry of identical bosons with respect to their
interchange, the annihilation reaction pp  00 cannot occur from a pp atomic s state.
however, experiments dating back to the early 70s have shown that the reaction occurs
readily for antiprotons stopping in liquid hydrogen. although this mode is allowed from
atomic p-state annihilations, the measurements with the crystal barrel detector of the
branching ratio for this reaction (when compared with the pp  + branching ratio)
would require 30% p-wave annihilations. experimental results from p, k p, and p
capture and other pp annihilation channels show that the fraction of p-wave annihilations is
less than 6% in agreement with theoretical expectations. thus, the experimental evidence
strongly indicates that the annihilation into 00 is occurring from an atomic s state. we
will discuss an experimental test involving x-rays in coincidence with the reaction, which
can determine whether or not this reaction is occurring predominantly from an atomic s
state and other tests involving vector meson decays. we will also consider how conventional
theory could be modied to allow this reaction to occur from an atomic s state.

the eigenvalues of parity and charge parity of a fermion-antifermion pair are given by [1],

p arity = (1)x+1,
charge parity = (1)x+s,

(1)

where x is the relative orbital angular momentum of the two particles and s is the spin of
the fermion-antifermion system. the eigenvalues of parity and charge parity of a two pion
system are given by [1],

p arity = (1)y ,
charge parity = (1)y ,

(2)

where y is the relative orbital angular momentum of the two pions. for the 00 system
there are further constraints. because of bose statistics the state of two identical pions
must be symmetric under interchange. thus, y must be even and both parity and charge

1

parity must be +1 for the 00 system. considering only low angular momentum states
(i.e., j = 0, 1), we obtain tables i-iii for initial and nal states.

thus we see that the reaction pp  00 cannot occur from an atomic s state of the pp
system.

we will briey review what happens when an antiproton or some other negatively charged
particle is slowed down in liquid hydrogen and is captured in a bohr orbit by a proton. this is
illustrated in fig. 1. typically, the incoming negatively charged particle is initially captured
in an orbit with principle quantum number n  30 and with high orbital angular momentum,
x. collisional deexcitations and radiative transitions transform the atom to lower n and x
values. the electrically neutral atom can then penetrate neighboring atoms and experience
the electric eld of the protons. this causes stark eect transitions between the degenerate
orbital angular momentum states. the rates for radiative transition and nuclear absorption
(or annihilation) from p states are small in comparison with the rate that the stark eect
populates the s state. since s-state absorption (or annihilation) can happen from high n
values, the atom is unlikely to deexcite to low n values for which p state nuclear absorption
(or annihilation) is more important.

it shows the eect of stark
transitions on dierent x states, radiative deexcitations, and levels from which nuclear absorption
or annihilation are likely.

thus, according to theory [2,3] absorption will occur predominantly from s states for 
and k . in 1960, desai [4] concluded, rough calculations indicate that for protonium also
the capture will take place predominantly from s states.

there is strong experimental evidence that s-state capture dominates in liquid h2. the

3

reactions p [5], k p [6], and p [7] have been studied. since these negatively-charged
particles decay, one can determine the nuclear absorption time by observing the fraction
which decay. the cascade times are about two orders of magnitude shorter than would be
required for radiative deexcitation. because the antiproton does not decay, such a measure-
ment is not possible. since the short cascade times for , k , and  cannot be explained
without recourse to the stark eect, the stark eect must also play a role in the pp case.

we will now look at the experimental results for pp  .

there is some direct evidence of s-state domination in pp reactions. it has been deter-
mined [8] that pp  kk < 6% p-wave with a 95% condence level. from the  decay
angular distribution, it has been determined [9,10] that pp  +0 < 5% p-wave. thus
the experimental evidence strongly supports s-state domination for pp reactions.
in liquid hydrogen the
branching ratio for pp  + is (31 1) 104 [11], while measurements of the branching
ratio for pp  00 are given in table iv.
the experimental results obtained with the crystal barrel detector are likely to be the
most accurate. as they noted in their paper [17], owning to our large detection eciency
and small background our result is least likely inuenced by undetected systematic errors.
the reliability of the result is strengthened by the internal consistency of a large set of
two-body branching ratios measured with the crystal barrel detector and their agreement
with previous determinations, especially with bubble chamber data.

one can calculate the fraction of p-wave annihilations for pp   as follows,

f raction pwave =

(pp  +)p + (pp  00)p
(pp  +)s&p + (pp  00)p

.

by assuming charge independence,

(pp  +)p = 2  (pp  00)p ,

(4)

(5)

we obtain the % p wave given in column 2 of table iv. the 55% p-wave, shown in table iv
for the crystal barrel collaboration, is obviously too high, and they decided to use another
method [17], involving the p-wave fraction for pp  + determined from a measurement
with gaseous hydrogen at ntp, giving 29% p wave for their result.

since even the 29% p-wave fraction is much too high, batty [19], trying to reduce this
value, modied the earlier calculations of reifenrother and e. klempt [20] using the borie
and leon model [21]. he tted the experimental data for pp   and pp  kk at several
target densities. without enhancement factors he obtained 27% for the p-wave fraction
at liquid hydrogen density. with enhancement of annihilations from ne structure states
over that expected from a statistical population and some adjustment of the parameters, he
could t the data (including the crystal barrel result) with a p-wave fraction of just 13%
at liquid hydrogen density. even with this heroic eort, the 13% p-wave fraction is still too
high when compared with the upper limit of 6% p-wave obtained from the results of other
pp annihilations [810].

there are two other experiments indicating anomalously large fractions of p-wave (75%)
involve antiproton annihilation at rest in liquid deuterium [22,23], although results from
a third experiment were consistent with 0% p wave [24]. again the percentage p-wave
calculation is based on charge independence and the theoretical argument that pd  n00
cannot occur from an atomic s state.
how can one explain these anomalies? since the results of experiments from all other
capture and annihilation reactions point to s-state domination, the most reasonable con-
clusion is that pp  00 is occurring from an atomic s state. this would have been the
conclusion long ago if it did not violate conventional theory.
although seven dierent groups have measured the branching ratio for pp  00,
showing the importance of this unexpectedly large branching ratio, no direct test has been
performed to determine whether the reaction could be occurring from an atomic s state.
such an experimental test can be made by setting up an initial pp atomic s state and looking
for the 00 nal state. the method is illustrated in fig. 2. as discussed earlier, in liquid
h2 the stark eect causes transitions to s states at high n-values, where annihilation occurs
more readily than deexcitation. one can decrease the eect of stark transitions by using
h2 gas at ntp, and thereby observe the deexcitation radiation.

the coincidence of l and k x-rays from protonium, shows that the atom is in the 1s
state. the energy of the k x-rays is between 9.4 kev (k) and 12.5 kev (k), while
energy of the l x-rays is between 1.7 kev and 3.1 kev. the energy of m x-rays is between
0.5 kev and 1.3 kev. thus, the x-rays from the dierent transitions tend to be separated.
the asterix collaboration has detected k x-rays in coincidence with l x-rays [25].
the experiment we are proposing is very similar, but requires the triple coincidence of l
and k x-rays from protonium and the 00 annihilation mode. the detection of such events
can prove that the annihilation reaction is occurring from an atomic s state.

as discussed above, even without this crucial experiment, there is signicant evidence
that the standard theory concerning this reaction may not be valid. we will now look at
what could be wrong with the theory. to match the initial 3s1 state of pp, the 00 system
needs a p1 state with parity = 1 and charge parity = 1 as shown on the second line of
table iii for the + system. in conventional theory, the 00 system has parity = +1
and charge parity = +1 for all states.

the big dierence in those eigenvalues between the + system and the 00 system
in conventional theory is caused by the two 0s being identical while the + and  are
not. thus, it must be possible for one 0 to exist in one internal states while the other 0
is in another internal state. this would result in the two 0s not always being identical.

x-rays. detection of triple coincidences of k and l x-rays and annihilation into 00 can prove
that the reaction occurs from an atomic s state.

assume the 0 eld is given by,

(x) = x

p

f (p) n[(p)  (p)] eipx
+ h(p)  (p)i eipxo ,

(6)

where (p) and (p) are creation operators for two dierent 0 states.

if the 0s are in dierent states, there is no requirement that the state of two 0s must
be symmetric under interchange. therefore, y can be odd for some 00 states just as for
the + system, leading to a p1 state with parity of 1.
1. consider a particular state of two 0s in the center of mass system,

next we will consider what is required for a state of two 0s to have charge parity of

 = x

k

eikr(k)(k)0,

(7)

where 0 is the vacuum state, k is the momentum of each particle, and r = r1  r2 is the
relative coordinate. applying the charge parity operator,

c = x

k

eikrc(k)c 1c(k)c 10.

(8)

if (p) and (p) were to each change into themselves under c, then this state would

be unchanged and the eigenvalue of charge parity would still be +1. we need,

for then,

c(k)c 1 = (k),
c(k)c 1 = (k),

c = x

k

eikr(k)(k)0.

but (p) and (p) commute. thus, after letting k  k we obtain,

c = x

k

eikr(k)(k)0.

applying the coordinate exchange operator pr results in,

prc = x

k

eikr(k)(k)0 = .

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

since p 1
r = pr, c = pr. the eigenvalues of pr = 1 depending upon the relative
angular momentum of the two particles. thus, the charge parity becomes the same as in the
+ case, given by eq. (2). if the 0 eld satises eqs. (6) and (9), then the annihilation
reaction,

pp (3s1)  00(p1)

7

(13)

is allowed.

according to the standard model, the pion is composed of up and down quarks,

+ = (u d),  = (u d), 0 =

1
2

(u u  d d).

(14)

although the 0 has two dierent states (i.e., u u and d d), the dierent states do not change
into each other under charge parity as required by eq. (9). thus some change to the pion
model is needed. we cannot make any suggestions in that regard other than to note that
composite states, such as g h and h g, where g and h are two dierent fermions, satisfy eq.
(9).

if the neutral pions are not identical just as the charged pions, then the branching ratio
of pp  00 from s states should be half that of pp  + by charge independence.
however, since the neutral pions have two dierent states they will only be non-identical
half the time. therefore, assuming all annihilations are from s states, the branching ratio
of pp  00 should equal 0.25  (31  104) = 7.8  104 which is roughly in agreement
with the crystal barrel collaborations result of (6.93  0.43)  104.
a referee has pointed out that some of vector mesons could decay into two 0s if they
are not identical, providing another test of this theory. as discussed above two non-identical
0s can be in a p1 state with j = 1, parity = 1, and charge parity = 1 which matches
the values for some of the vector mesons.
we considered the 00 decay mode of the (770)0, (782), (1020), and j/(1s). these
reactions are forbidden by isospin conservation, but they can proceed electromagnetically. in
estimating the branching ratios, we assumed that the 00 mode would occur at about the
same rate as the + mode, but reduced by a factor of two because the two 0s are only
non-identical half the time. however, the (770)0 has i = 1, so the reaction (770)0  +
is allowed by isospin conservation because the + system can have i = 0, 1, or 2, while
the reaction (770)0  00 is forbidden because the 00 system can only have i = 0 or 2.
occurring electromagnetically, its branching ratio would be reduced by the factor 2.

our estimated branching ratios are,

br((770)0  00) = 5  105,
br((782)  00) = 1  102,
br((1020)  00) = 4  105,
br(j/(1s)  00) = 7  105.

(15)

the only measured upper limit [26], br((1020)  00) < 4105, is just in the expected
range.
