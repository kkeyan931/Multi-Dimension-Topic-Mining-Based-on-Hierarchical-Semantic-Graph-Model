recently m. kontsevich found a combinatorial formula dening a star-product of

deformation quantization for any poisson manifold. kontsevichs formula has been rein-

terpreted physically as quantum correlation functions of a topological sigma model for open

strings as well as in the context of d-branes in at backgrounds with a neveu-schwarz b-

eld. here the corresponding kontsevichs formula for the dual of a lie algebra is derived

in terms of the formalism of d-branes on group manifolds. in particular we showed that

that formula is encoded at the two-point correlation functions of the wess-zumino-witten

eective theory with dirichlet boundary conditions. the b-eld entering in the formalism

plays an important role in this derivation.

1. introduction

d-branes are extremely interesting objects which were originally applied to realize

string dualities and to probe substringly distances (for a review, see [1]). one of the

most exciting aspects of d-brane physics is the realization and explanation of several

mathematical constructions in the language of physical processes of branes. for instance,

the adhm construction of yang-mills instantons founds a nice realization in terms of

d-brane congurations (for a review of this subject, see [2]).

integrability present in the formulation of the string theory on group manifolds, orig-

inally studied in [3], provided an excellent guide in the search of a realistic string theory.
the study of d-branes on group manifolds was rst considered by klimcik and severa
in [4] and further developed in [5,6,7] from the point of view of boundary states theory.

some results of ref. [4] will be of particular usefulness for the purposes of this paper and

they will be reviewed at the section 3. of special interest is the result of [4] that a wzw

lagrangian can be well dened for open strings propagating in a group manifold. this

eective lagrangian can be obtained from the pairing between the relative homology chain
and the relative cohomology chain, i.e. h(g/hm, z)  h (g/hm, z)  z where the
integer-valued relative homology and cohomology ensures a well dened feynman path

integral. here g is the group manifold and hm is a group submanifold of g. within this

context d-branes of various dimensionality are identied with the submanifolds h and the

open world-sheet w generated by the propagation of the open string in g can be iden-

tied with the relative homology cycles of the corresponding dimension. more recently,

it has been shown that d-branes identied with the submanifolds hm correspond to the

conjugacy classes of the relevant lie group g. thus open strings end points are permitted

to be xed in such a classes and stretched between pairs of them [8] (for a very nice recent

review on the subject, see [9]).

on the other hand very recently a renewed deal of excitation has been taken place in

deformation quantization theory [10], since the kontsevichs seminal paper [11]. in this

paper kontsevich proved by construction the existence of a star-product for any nite

dimensional poisson manifold. his construction is based on his more general statement

known as the formality conjecture. the existence of such a star-product determines the

existence of a deformation quantization for any poisson manifold. kontsevichs proof was

strongly motivated by some perturbative issues of string theory and topological gravity in

two-dimensions, such as, matrix models, the triangulation of the moduli space or riemann

surfaces and mirror symmetry [12].

1

kontsevichs star product can also be dened for the dual of a lie algebra g. the
structure of g as a vector space it is known to be isomorphic to rn, being n the number
of generators of the lie algebra g. g with the kirillov-poisson structure is a poisson
manifold and the kontsevichs star-product can be dened [11]. it is also well known that
other star-products can be dened on g for any lie algebra g. the rst of them was
obtained by gutt [13] by studying the hochschild cohomology of lie algebras. there it
was used not the kirillov-poisson structure on g but only the symplectic structure on
the cotangent bundle to the relevant lie group (for a recent progress on this subject, see

[14]). gutts star-product is naturally connected to the termed campbell-baker-hausdor

(cbh) quantization through suitable deformations of the universal enveloping algebras as

we shall review in section 2 following refs. [15,16].

the relation of kontsevichs quantization to the cbh quantization, was amply dis-

cussed in [15] (see also [16]). it was shown in these references that both the kontsevichs
and universal enveloping algebra quantization (also called u-quantization), are obtained
from the exponentiation of the kirillov-poisson structure on g, through the cbh-formula
(for a review about the cbh-formula for the discrete and continuos cases, see [17]). more-

over both quantizations are exactly the same when kontsevichs formula is restricted to

consider only symmetric-admissible graphs (with the loop-graphs being neglected [15]). in

ref. [18], such equivalence is further investigated from the point of view of the formality

conjecture. finally the study of lie bi-algebras and their quantization was initialized by

drinfeld. he conjectured that every poisson-lie group has a canonical quantization. the

proof of this conjecture was given recently by etingof and kazhdan [19]. recently a new

proof of the formality conjecture was given by tamarkin [20] involving operads and mo-

tives. the implications of this new proof in the deformation quantization theory was more

recently given by kontsevich [21].

afterwards a path integral interpretation of the kontsevichs star-product was worked

out very recently by cattaneo and felder [22].

in this paper kontsevichs formula is

extracted from the three-point correlation functions on the disc from the perturbation

theory of a bosonic topological open string theory on the target space provided with the

relevant poisson structure. formality conjecture issues were also described there in eld

theoretic grounds. further developments in this context were worked out at [23]. the

study of noncommutative gauge theories on poisson manifolds was recently discussed in

[24].

2

among various applications of d-branes of particular interest, for the purposes of this
paper, is that of the d-brane realization of the kontsevichs star-product [11]. kontsevichs

star product can be also derived from the correlation functions of open string theory in

for at backgrounds, but with non-trivial constant b-eld [25]. in this paper we pursue a

similar derivation of the kontsevichs quantization formula for the dual of a lie algebra in

eld theoretic terms. in particular we show that it can be obtained from the wess-zumino-

witten theory for open strings with dirichlet boundary conditions. to be more precise we

will show that that kontsevich star product is encoded in the eective eld theory on the

d-brane in group manifolds described in [4].

one of the main lessons of the stringly [22] and d-brane [25] descriptions of kont-

sevichs formula in that of that the deformation quantization for any poisson manifold

requires necessarily of string theory. the deformation parameter of this quantization is
precisely the string scale  (or the string coupling constant) which in the limit   0
reproduces the eld theory limit but in this limit the deformation quantization does not
exist. the deformation arising precisely when 
6= 0 is an indication that deformation
quantization is an stringly phenomenon. actually it was already suspected since the origin
of the formality conjecture where several mathematical ingredients of string theory were

present.

deformation quantization also arises in the description of the behavior of d-branes in

type iia and iib superstring theory on tori and in a background b-eld [26]. in particular,

the m(atrix)-theory compactications on tori have been seen described through a yang-

mills gauge theory (with sixteen supercharges) on the noncommutative dual tori (for a

recent review, see [27] and for some recent progress, see [28,29]). fedosov deformation

quantization can be also incorporated into this context following the lines of [30].

we start in section 2 by reviewing some basic features of the relevant star-products
of the dual lie algebra g, we will follows mainly the work of kathotia [15]. in section 3
we describe some necessary facts about the theory of d-branes on group manifolds [4]. in
section 4 we discuss the derivation of the kontsevichs formula for g from the theory of
d-branes on group manifolds. finally, section 5 contains our concluding remarks.

2. overview of the various star-products in the dual of a lie algebra

in this section we will give an overview of the star-products on the dual lie algebra
g, in particular of the kontsevichs star product and its relation with the various dierent

3

star-products arising in the literature. our aim is not to provide an extensive review of

such constructions, but to briey recall the relevant structure of these quantizations and

provide the notation, which we will need in the following sections. for a more complete

treatment see refs. [15,16,18]. we will follow mainly the notation of ref. [15].

2.1. linear poisson structure. u -quantization

2 f ij

k in the way [x i, x j] = f ij

let us rst briey review the linear poisson structures. for deniteness we are going
to consider the deformation quantization of the dual lie algebra g to the lie algebra g
associated to a compact and simple lie group g. g is provided with the canonical kirillov-
poisson structure given by the structure constants of g, f ij
k x k,
for any pair of elements x i and x j of a basis of g. the kirillov-poisson structure on g
is given by  = 1
k x ki  j. here the elements x i can be seen also as the local basis
on g. now in order to induce a star-product on the space of smooth functions c(g)
on g, it can be constructed from some induced structure by a suitable deformation of the
universal enveloping algebra u(gh) and the deformation of the symmetric tensor algebra
s(g)[[h]] of g where h is the deformation parameter. s(g)[[h]] can be identied with
the space of polynomial functions on g taking values in the innite formal series in h.
thus if  is the algebra isomorphism (given by the symmetrization of monomials through
the poincare-birkho-witt theorem) between u(gh) and s(g)[[h]], it can be induced a
star-product on c(g)[[h]] in the form p  q = 1(cid:0)(p )  (q)(cid:1), where p, q are
two elements on c(g)[[h]] and  is an associative and noncommutative product in
the universal enveloping algebra u 3. linear poisson structure of g leads naturally to two
equivalent quantizations, the uquantization and the cbh quantization. for the purposes
of this paper is enough to describe more in detail, the cbh-quantization. the star product

dened as above is equivalent to the gutts star-product dened on the cotangent bundle

to the lie group g [13]. of course they coincide with the star-product in the direction of
the kirillov-poisson , that is, p  q = 1
 j q. thus the star-product on g

 ip 



2 f ij

k x k



can generated through the cbh-formula. this is the subject of the next section.

3

in the above procedure it was used the fact that c(g )[[h]] and s(g)[[h]] are canonically

isomorphic.

4

2.2. campbell-baker-hausdor quantization

the campbell-baker-hausdor quantization is based in the cbh-formula for the

group multiplication. the product of two group elements of the form exp(x) and exp(y )
with x, y being elements of the lie algebra g is given by

exp(x)  exp(y ) = exp(h(x, y ))

(2.1)

where h(x, y ) is a series of the form

h(x, y ) = x + y +

1
2

[x, y ] +

1
12

([x, [x, y ]] + [x, y ], y ]) + . . .

(2.2)

with [x, y ] is the lie bracket in g.

now we consider a basis of g given by {x i} with i = 1, . . . , d. by using the kirillov-
poisson structure, the generators of g are also seen as coordinates in g. this permits to
establish, for any small real number t, the correspondence between the functions exp(tx)
on g and the group elements of the form exp(tx) with x  g

functions on g  group elements exp(tx) with x  g.

(2.3)

pulling-back the group multiplication to the functions via this correspondence leads to

the cbh-quantization. this correspondence will be of prime importance bellow in the

construction of the star-product through the d-brane technology in section 4. meanwhile

we will describe this correspondence with certain detail. under this correspondence the
cbh-formula induces a bi-dierential operator d : c(g)  c(g)  c(g). the
procedure to construct this operator is by constructing rst its symbol d and then nding

out its corresponding operator. consider rst the relation

exp(cid:18)h(x, y )  x  y(cid:19) = exp(cid:18) 1

2

[x, y ] +

([x, [x, y ]] + [[x, y ], y ]) + . . .(cid:19) (2.4)

coming from the group multiplication of the elements exp(x) and exp(y ). substituting
x = six i and y = tjx j in the above formula, its rhs provides a denition of the symbol

where si and ti i, j = 1, . . . , d are real valued commuting variables.

this formula tell us that the symbol d depends linearly on the variables x k with x k
being the local coordinates on g which are commuting variables too. thus in the denition
of the symbol given by eq. (2.5) there is no noncommuting variables which leads to some

ambiguities. the operator d by itself is determined as usual by the substitution of si 
 i
and tj 


 j. it is given by

d = exp(cid:18) 1

(2.7)

for the functions f = exp(sx) and g = exp(ty ) on g. thiss product determines a
deformation of the point wise multiplication in the direction of the poisson bracket .

the associativity of  is induced from the associativity of the group multiplication via

the pull-back of such a property from the cbh-formula. written explicitly eq. (2.7) looks

like

exp(six i)  exp(tjx j) = d(cid:18)x, f , (

(2.8)
where we have displayed the explicit dependence of the bi-dierential operator d on the

vector eld x, the structure constants f and the higher order derivatives.

in terms of the symbol d this last expression is given by

exp(six i)exp(tjx j) = d(cid:18)x, f , (s1, s2, . . . , sd), (t1, t2, . . . td)(cid:19)exp(six i)exp(tjx j) (2.9)

where d is given by the eq. (2.5). for future convenience we write another form of the

star-product (2.9) in the form

exp(six i)  exp(tjx j) = exp(cid:18)h(six i, tjx j)  six i  tjx j(cid:19)exp(six i)exp(tjx j)

= exp(cid:0)h(six i, tjx j)(cid:1)

(2.10)

where it is explicitly shown the realization through the cbh-formula.

or in general from eq. (2.8) the star-product is given by

exp(six i)  exp(tjx j)

where . . . denotes the rest of the terms in the expansion of the exponential given in eq.

(2.6). for further details of the properties of the cbh-quantization see [15].

2.3. kontsevichs quantization of g

now we recall the basic formulas form the kontsevichs construction of the star-

product on any poisson manifold m [11].

the kontsevichs formula is a sum over a suitable class of oriented labeled admissible
graphs gn of order n  0 (constructed from n wedges graphs). an admissible graph  is
an element of gn if it is constructed from n + 2 aerial vertices {1, 2, . . . , n} and two ground
xed vertices {l, r} with v = {1, 2, . . . , n}  {l, r} and 2n edges from the set of edges
of , e such that for each vertex vk of {1, 2, . . . , n} there are a pair of edges emanating
from vk to any other of the aerial vertices except for vk itself i.e. there are no loops. the
pair of edges emanating from each vk of the aerial vertices are labeled as e1

k and e2
k.

in [11] kontsevich found a correspondence between each graph  of gn and bi-

dierential operators in the form:

  gn  b, : c(m )  c(m )  c(m )

with m the poisson manifold. thus the kontsevich star-product is a weight function and

it is given by

where hn is the space of congurations of n numbered pairwise distinct points on h
given by the n-punctured upper half-plane h = {z  c/im(z) > 0} endowed with the
lobachevsky metric. the integral determining the weights (2.13) it was proved to be
absolutely convergent [11]. finally h
are harmonic functions on hn representing

the angles between l(p, ) and the edges e1

(2.14)

in the particular case when the poisson manifold m is identied with g, the kontse-
vichs formula has very interesting interconnections with the others deformation quantiza-
tions of g. it was shown in refs. [15,16,18] that taking the vector elds x and y from eq.
(2.4) to be located at the ground vertices l and r of the kontsevichs construction. in this

case the only possible graphs associated to the bi-dierential operators b,, are of two
types: i). loop graphs and ii). symmetric-admissible graphs. for the particular case of
nilpotent lie algebras, the loop graphs contribution is vanishing [15] and the kontsevichs

deformation quantization star-product coincides exactly with the cbh star-product eq.

(2.11). for more general lie algebras (no necessarily nilpotent) loop graphs are non-zero

but still is possible to nd a mapping providing the equivalence between the kontsevichs

and cbh star-products [15,16,18].

3. d-branes on group manifolds

in this section we describe some elementary facts about d-branes in group manifolds

which we will need in the next section. another description of d-branes in group manifolds

in the boundary state formalism would be relevant for the deformation quantization theory

[5,6,7]. however for the purposes of this paper we will follows the lines of refs. [4,9].

8

it is well known that the propagation of closed strings in a group manifold g is
described by the wzw lagrangian for the eld g :   g [3,31] satisfy the closed string
boundary conditions g(0,  ) = g(2,  )

right invariant three form on the group manifold g given by

 =

12

tr(cid:0)g1dg  g1dg  g1dg(cid:1).

(3.3)

in the eq. (3.2)eg is an extension of g to the volume b i.e. eg : b  g. such an extension

exists if 2(g = 0. finally the coupling constant k is an integer-valued constant and it is
an element of h 3(g, z). actually the three-form  on g is a integer-valued cohomology
class, i.e. an element of h 3(g, z). this implies that  is a closed form on g but  never

is the dierential of a global two-form  over g. that means that it is not possible to

dene a gobal two-form  over g.

for the case of open strings the lagrangian (3.1) is not well dened. the reason of

this is as follows: the propagation of open strings in g generates an open world-sheet

w on which it can be coupled to a global two-form  on g. for the reasons mentioned

previously such a global form cannot be dened on g. thus for open strings the rst term

of the lagrangian (3.1) is still well dened but the second one is not.

now in order to consider a d-brane conguration in g, that is, two parallel subman-

ifolds h1 and h2 of g and open strings stretched between these submanifolds [4,9]. one
can associate locally the required two-form on each submanifold hi i = 1, 2 i.e. ci on hi

for i = 1, 2, respectively. these forms satisfy

that means that the ci forms are chosen such that their exterior derivative coincides with

the restriction of the three-form  on each submanifold hi.

|hi = dci.

(3.4)

9

ambiguities of the wz-term for this d-brane conguration is given by [4]

(g) = (g) zp1

g(c1) zp2

g(c2).

(3.5)

where pi is a two-dimensional submanifold of hi for i = 1, 2 respectively and it is precisely

the two-dimensional projection to hi of the volume generated by the variation of the word-

sheet w connecting h1 and h2 in the group manifold g.

notice that this action is well dened only locally. thus the elds g are restricted to

live in the corresponding submanifold hi of g. in general hi are not necessary to be a

subgroup of g. however the case in which it coincides with the conjugacy classes of g is

quite interesting and it will be discussed in the next section in the context of deformation

quantization of adjoint and coadjoint orbits of g.

thus wzw theory for open strings with their end points on the d-branes is well

dened in terms of the triple (, c1, c2). m strings propagating in g and satisfying the

dirichlet boundary conditions on the group submanifolds hi as above is given by

ld(g) =

where z and z are the complex coordinates on the disc w . the sum in eq. (3.6) is over

the number of components of the boundary on the disc w . action (3.6) is well dened

and it is completely specied by the forms (, cm). such a pair can be interpreted as an
element of the relative cohomology chain h (g/hm, z). the world-sheet w and in general

higher-dimensional world-volumes wk of dimension k can be interpreted as k-dimensional

cycles of the relative homology chain h(g/hm, z) i.e. k-dimensional submanifolds of g

whose boundary lies in the hm d-branes. thus the relative integer homology classies

the dierent d-branes in the group manifold g. the z-valued (co)homology is necessary

in order that the feynman path integral be well dened.

thus the wzw action for an open string in the d-brane conguration is given by

lw (g) =

4 zw

d2tr(cid:18)g1zg  g1zg(cid:19)

b,

(3.7)

where b = eg(g) with g is the local two-form dened on the image of w under g, such

that  = dg.

10

if the boundary of w is empty then the term rw b is invariant under the transfor-
mation b  b + d. but if the case is such that the boundary of w is no empty then the
term rw b will transforms as

zw

b zw

b +zw h

.

(3.8)

at this step one can imitate the standard case of d-branes in type ii string theories [32]
by noting that c  b on the d-brane is a closed form, then locally we have abelian degrees
of freedom a in the boundaries of the open string attached to the d-brane and it is given

by

zw h

a.

(3.9)

thus the gauge invariance can be restored if the gauge transformation for the b-eld is
accompanied by the transformation of a in the form a  a  |h. the gauge invariant
eld strength is not f = da but the combination b = f  b. thus the eective action is

lw (g) = 

k

4 zw

d2tr(cid:18)g1zg  g1zg(cid:19) 

k

4 zw b.

(3.10)

the gauge eld in two-dimensions has no-propagating degrees of freedom and it implies
that eld strength b should be constant, b = 1
2 ijbij. thus a b-eld term can be consistly
introduced into the wzw description of open strings in group manifolds when d-brane
congurations are included. in the next section we will show that precisely this b-eld
term will plays a crucial role in the derivation of the kontsevichs star-product for the dual
lie algebra g.

in ref.

[8] it was shown that the explicit form of b can also be extracted from the
boundary condition in the closed string picture j = j where j and j are the holomorphic
and anti-holomorphic chiral currents of the wzw model [5,6,7,8] and it is given by

where ad(g) is the adjoint action of g on the lie algebra g. it is given by ad(g)x :=
dt|t=0g(exptx)g1 for all g in g.
in this picture, the d-brane is identied with the
(co)adjoint orbit (conjugacy class) of g. this result leads to a reconciliation between the

approach [4] and the boundary state description [5,6].

4. d-branes in g and the kontsevich star product on g

the aim of this section is the derivation of the kontsevichs formula of deformation
quantization for the dual of a lie algebra g. we will argue that this formula is encoded
in the theory of d-branes on group manifolds as given in refs. [4,8,9] and reviewed in the

previous section.

first of all we shall recall that the eective wzw eld theory on the d-brane in a

group manifold g is given by the eq. (3.10). for deniteness we will take a compact and
simple group manifold g whose dual lie algebra g be provided with the kirillov-poisson
structure. it is an easy matter to show that eq. (3.10) can be rewritten as

where {ta} with a = 1, . . . , dim(g) is a basis of g. it is well known from the theory of
open strings that the disc w can be transformed into the upper half-plane h with the
boundary of the disc mapped into the boundary of h located at im(z) = 0.

we will consider the correlation functions on the disc w of the operators g located in

0 and 1 in the boundary of w . these correlation functions will be dened taking only the

since the elds g are g-valued mappings it is natural to assume that the insertion

operators in 0 and 1 on the boundary of the disc are given by

(4.2) and (4.3).

we propose that the two-point correlation function for the complete action lw of

eq. (4.1) leads to the kontsevichs formula of the deformation quantization of the dual
lie algebra g of the group manifold g. this implies that the mentioned kontsevichs
formula is encoded in the theory of open strings with dirichlet boundary conditions in

group manifolds. thus we should consider the complete action lw including the b-eld

term too. coecient of the b-eld term goes as 1/k and in the large-k limit one can

consider this term as a perturbation and use the usual 1/k-perturbation theory. before

of proceeding with the 1/k-expansion we consider generically the eect of the b-eld term

in the two-point correlation functions. thus one can dene new (deformed) correlation
functions hg(1)  g(0)ib for this perturbed system in the form

hg(1)  g(0)ib =

in eq. (4.8) we have replaced w by h. the point (z, z) where the holomorphic j(z) and
anti-holomorphic j(z) chiral currents are evaluated, is an specic point of the interior of
the h-plane.

the product g(1)g(0) inside the above correlation function is the usual group product

we can now apply the cbh-formula (2.1) to the above equation and it results

g(1)  g(0) = exp(cid:0)j(cid:1)  exp(cid:0)j(cid:1).

the fact that g(0) and g(1) can be seen as smooth functions on g it does not implies that
they can be seen as functions on the disc w . they are actually operators and one has

to compute the remaining correlation functions on the disc. in order to do that one must

give the operator product expansion (ope) of the operators g with the currents j and j.

formula (4.23) reproduces exactly the konsevichs star-product eq. (2.12) dened on
the space of smooth functions on the dual lie algebra g of the group manifold g. it is
remarkable that the kontsevichs formula was obtained explicitly as a 1/k-expansion for the

large-k limit. this is a typical characteristic of a string perturbative expansion in its string

coupling constant in the correspondence between the topological sigma model for open

strings and the chern-simons eective eld theory [33]. in fact, the close relation between

chern-simons and wzw model leads us to think that a description of the kontsevichs

formula in terms of the feynman diagrams of the chern-simons theory is possible. actually

it is no surprising form the results of [22,23,25].

several comments are in order. the rst one concerns with the relation with the

boundary states description of d-branes in group manifolds [5,6,7]. from there it is known

that dirichlet boundary conditions of open strings in groups can be encoded in the algebraic

structure of the corresponding superconformal algebra. within this prescription it was

shown in [8] that for d-branes h with group structure, i.e. subgroups of g, for instance

adjoint or coadjoint orbits c of g. boundary state prescription implies that open strings

can end on this orbits c dening d-particles. from [6] if c constitutes a lagrangian
submanifold of g then t g|c = t c  n c, where t c and n c are the respective tangent
and normal bundle to c. if we have a distinguished point (the identity) it turns out to be
g = c  c at the level of lie algebras. now if we assume that the boundary components
of the disc are mapped into the real part of g i.e. are mapped to c, then the elds of
the lagrangian (4.1) will be c-valued elds and therefore the deformation quantization
(4.23) will describes the deformation quantization of the coadjoint orbits
formula eq.

c. in particular, for semi-simple lie groups g, the corresponding star-product fom the

cbh-quantization should gives the quantization described in [34].

following ref. [35] it is well known that a topological eld theory should lives in the

corresponding d-brane wrapped in the lagrangian submanifolds of g. this topological

eld theory is provided by the eective eld theory on the d-brane w given by the wzw

lagrangian for open strings or its extensions to gauged wzw-theory [6,36]. it is expected

that a deeper treatment of the brst and bv approach of wzw theory of d-branes would
be a better framework to understand the kontsevichs formula for g and its description

16

in terms of the formality conjecture in a similar way than cattaneo and felder [22] found

the kontsevichs formula from a topological non-linear sigma model for open strings by

using the bv quantization method. we leave this subject for a future investigation.

5. concluding remarks

the close relation between deformation quantization theory (and in general noncom-

mutative geometry) and the theory of d-branes has appeared in diverse ways in the lit-

erature [22,23,21,25,27]. in the present paper we found new evidence which favored this

relation. here we have explored some interplay between the d-brane theory on the group
manifold g and the kontsevichs star-product on the dual lie algebra g of the group g.
our derivation has some similarity to the derivation of the kontsevichs product on rn

by using the two-point correlation functions from the perturbative theory of open strings
in rn in a background b-eld [25]. however various dierent things are in order. in our

case the relevant theory is the eective wzw-eld theory describing d-branes living in

the group manifold g [4]. this eective eld theory is given by the pairing in relative

(co)homology class h(g/h, z). this implies the consistent existence of a background b-

eld term which is coupled to the world-sheet w . this b-eld term, as we have showed,

it generates a 1/k-expansion which can be (under some specications) identied with the
kontsevichs formula for g.

it is interesting to conclude from our results that the kontsevichs formula on g given
eq. (4.23) can be seen as a 1/k-perturbative expansion of the wzw eective eld theory

on a d-brane in g. moreover witten has showed in [33] that chern-simons perturbation

theory can been seen as a perturbative open string theory with the 1/k-expansion of

the chern-simons theory coinciding with the perturbative expansion of the string theory.

chern-simons eld theory represents the low energy eective eld theory of the string

theory with the string coupling constant given by 1/k. thus our result of getting the

kontsevichs formula as a perturbative expansion in the string coupling constant conrms

the current statement that the deformation quantization of any poisson manifold needs of

stringly concepts [22,25,21].

it is very well known that 1/k-perturbative expansions in wzw theory are related

to 1/k-perturbative expansions in the chern-simons theory. thus one can, in principle,

17

to translate our results in terms of a topological perturbative invariants of chern-simons

theory. it would be interesting to study the kontsevichs formula as given in [22] and to look

for its relation to the rozansky-witten invariants [37]. it would be interesting to explore

further interplay between the poisson-lie t-duality of the wzw theory for d-branes [4]

and the relevant algebraic relations involved in the quantization of lie bi-algebras as worked

out in [19]. also, following [25] one would trying to generalize the cbh-quantization

and its relation to kontsevichs formula to curved manifolds (riemannian phase spaces)

through the application of the boundary deformation theory [38]. it would be interesting

to compare these results to those obtained by bordemann et al [39] in the context of

fedosovs formalism.

finally, the search for a deeper interplay between the string theory tools as: conformal

eld, theory, maldacenas conjecture, d-branes and d-branes in group manifolds, moduli

spaces etc. and mathematics tools as: formality conjecture, operads, motives etc. pointed

out in [21] deserves intensive further investigation.

one of us (h. g.-c.) would like to thank prof. e. witten for hospitality at the

institute for advanced study. it is a pleasure to thank i. carrillo for useful discussions.
