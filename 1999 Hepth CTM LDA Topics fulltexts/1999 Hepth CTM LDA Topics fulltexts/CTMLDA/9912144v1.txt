abstract

the heterotic e8  e8 string compactied on an orbifold t 4/zn has gauge
group g  g with (massless) states in its twisted sectors which are charged
under both gauge group factors. in the dual m-theory on (t 4/zn )  (s1/z2)
the two group factors are separated in the eleventh direction and the g and g
gauge elds are conned to the two boundary planes, respectively. we present
a scenario which allows for a resolution of this apparent paradox and assigns
all massless matter multiplets locally to the dierent six-dimensional bound-
ary xed planes. the resolution consists of diagonal mixing between the gauge
groups which live on the connecting seven-planes (6d and the eleventh dimen-
sion) and one of the gauge group factors. we present evidence supporting this
mixing by considering gauge couplings and verify local anomaly cancellation.
we also discuss open problems which arise in the presence of u1 factors.

1. introduction

the role of m-theory for string duality is undisputed. nevertheless, we are far from

understanding this 11-dimensional theory at a fundamental level. we know that at partic-
ular points in its moduli space all known string theories are recovered. moreover, the low

energy physics is captured by 11-dimensional supergravity. compactication and duality

symmetries provide data which allow us to gain some insight into the structure of m-theory
(see e.g. refs. [1], [2], [3] for reviews).

in this paper we concentrate on 10-dimensional e8e8 heterotic string theory compact-
ied on t 4/zn orbifolds and its dual m-theory description. the e8  e8 heterotic string
is dual to m-theory on s1/z2  i. horava and witten have shown [4] that one e8 factor
lives on each of the two boundary ten-planes1 and that the corresponding gauge multiplets
are conned to it. there is no a priori m-theoretical explanation of the appearance of
the e8 gauge group on each of the two ten-planes, but they are needed for local anomaly
cancellation. thus, anomaly cancellation provides important constraints which teach us
about the structure of m-theory.

considering the proposed duality between the heterotic string on ir5,1  (t 4/zn ) and
m-theory on ir5,1  (t 4/zn )  (s1/z2) one immediately encounters the following puzzle.
suppose both ten-plane e8 groups are broken in the six-dimensional theory; let g  g 
e8e8 denote the surviving subgroup. the twisted sectors of heterotic orbifolds generally
contain massless states which are charged under both g and g. in the horavawitten
theory however, g is g and g is g, they live on dierent ten-plains and nowhere the
twain shall meet, so there does not seem to be any place where a massless state can be
simultaneously charged with respect to both g and g. indeed, how would a state residing
at one end of the eleventh dimension know about the gauge group acting on the other
side? somehow, in the eective seven-dimensional gauge theory on ir5,1  (s1/z2) gauge
quantum numbers ought to ow from one end of the x11 to the other end; the main
objective of our work is to understand how this works.

the same problem also arises in the phenomenologically more interesting examples of

orbifold compactications to four dimensions. in fact, our initial motivation was to un-
derstand how the gauge quantum numbers work in the four-dimensional orbifolds, but the

situation in six dimensions turned out to be easier. in particular, we got very useful hints

from the requirement of local anomaly cancellation, which are much stronger in d = 6

1 throughout we refer to an extended object as a plane. e.g. a ten-plane has ten space-time
dimensions.

1

than in d = 4. consequently, in this article we restrict ourselves to the discussion of the

six-dimensional theories with the intention to come back to the four-dimensional case in

the future.

in m-theory, an an1 singularity of the k3 compactication  such as a zn xed point
of an orbifold  supports an sun gauge theory on the corresponding seven-plane ir5,1 
{f.p.}  (s1/z2). the cartan sub-algebra arises from the zero modes of the three-form
potential of 11d sugra and the completion to sun is achieved by m2 branes wrapped
on a vanishing 2-cycle in the orbifold limit of the smooth k3 compactication manifold.
these seven-plane gauge groups play a vital role in our resolution of the paradoxical gg
charges of the twisted states: at one end of the eleventh dimension, say at x11 = 0, the
seven-plane sun mixes with a similar factor of g  the unbroken subgroup of the e8
living on the ten-plane boundary of the entire 11d spacetime. the mixing happens along
the six-planes where the xed seven-planes intersect the x11 = 0 ten-plane, but it has
global consequences for the resulting eective theory: the diagonal ten-plane/seven-plane
sun gauge group appears to be a subgroup of the ten-plane g, but actually reaches along
the xed seven-planes to the other end of the x11. consequently, along the six-planes
where the xed seven-planes carrying the sun intersect the second ten-plane carrying g,
we have both sun and g gauge elds at the same location in space  and hence the
twisted states living on those six-planes may have both the su diag
and the g charges in
a perfectly local fashion.

n

the bottom line is, the twisted states have local g  su 7p

charges but from the global
point of view, they have simultaneous charges under the g and the diagonal sun gauge
groups. the apparent paradox of simultaneous g and g charges is due to mis-identication
of the diagonal ten-plane/seven-plane sun as a subgroup of the ten-plane g  e8. this
mis-identication is natural in the perturbative heterotic string theory where the entire

n

eleventh dimension is invisible and everything lives in ten dimensions. in the m-theory,

one needs to be more careful.

in this article, we shall marshal three lines of evidence for the mixing of ten-plane and

seven-plane gauge groups. first, this is the only way to reconcile the massless spectra of

heterotic orbifolds with locality of the dual m-theory description. second, the heterotic

gauge couplings (which can be computed exactly in six dimensions) will show that some
sun gauge groups cannot be of purely perturbative origin but must be diagonally mixed
with several non-perturbative factors,

and the number  of the non-perturbative sun factors will always turn out to be equal
to the number of xed seven-planes in m-theory that carry sun gauge groups. finally,
each six-plane in m-theory suers from local anomalies which are sensitive to spectra of

massless particles living on the six-planes themselves, on the seven-planes, on the ten-

planes and in the eleven-dimensional bulk as well as inow and intersection anomalies due

to the m-theorys chernsimons terms. in six dimensions, it is very dicult to cancel the

local anomalies unless one has correct local spectra of all the elds  and we shall see

that the ten-plane/seven-plane gauge group mixing indeed provides for cancellation of all

the local anomalies.

the rest of this paper is organized as follows: we begin with an illustrative example of
a z2 orbifold. in section 2 we take a close look at the seven-plane and the ten-plane su2
gauge groups of this orbifold and discuss their mixing from both heterotic and m-theory
points of view. in particular, we show how the mixing explains the su2 charges of the
twisted states as well as the exact value of the su2 gauge coupling. in section 3 we conrm
our solution by verifying local anomaly cancellation. in these two sections we try to be
as explicit as possible. section 4 generalizes our approach to other zn orbifolds. the
subtleties that arise in non-prime orbifolds are treated in detail.

unfortunately, our proposed solution works for some zn orbifolds but has diculties
with others. section 5 describes two common types of complications, both associated with
broken seven-plane sun groups. in some orbifolds (discussed in section 5.1), the perturba-
tive ten-plane gauge groups dont mix with the non-perturbative seven-plane groups. as

far as the eective six-dimensional eective theory is concerned, the seven-plane groups

are completely invisible, but the local anomalies on the six-planes are not so blind. to
cancel the anomalies, we have to assume that the seven-plane gauge groups are not suns
but rather their cartan subgroups u (n1)
. alas, from the seven-dimensional point of view,
all zn xed planes are created equal and we have no idea how or why does the m-theory
decide that such xed planes carry full sun gauge groups in some orbifolds but only the
cartan u (n1)
subgroups in others. worse problems plague orbifold models where the ten-
plane and the seven-plane gauge groups do mix but the mixing involves abelian factors.

1

in section 5.2 we show that in such models local anomaly cancellation does not seem to

work and we speculate how the seven-dimensional chernsimons terms might remedy this

problem.

section 6 summarizes our results. appendices a, b and c contain some useful data

about the anomalies in six dimensions and as well as some related group theory.

2. compactication on z2

2.1. heterotic vs. m-theory point of view

consider the perturbative compactication of the e8  e8 heterotic string on the t 4/z2
orbifold limit of k3. z2 acts as (z1, z2)  (z1, z2) on the two complex coordinates of t 4.
under this transformation all four moduli of the torus are invariant and are thus also moduli
of the orbifold. there are sixteen orbifold xed points. this compactication has n = 1
supersymmetry in d = 6 (eight supercharges). we represent the discrete z2 transformation
in the e8  e8 gauge lattice via the shift vector  = ( 1
2 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
this results in the gauge group g  g = [e7  su2]  so16  e8  e8. the massless
matter in the untwisted sector consists of hyper-multiplets transforming as (56, 2; 1) and
(1, 1; 128). they only carry charges of g or g. the untwisted sector also includes the
four moduli which are gauge singlets. the massless matter in the twisted sector consists of

2 , 1

sixteen half-hyper-multiplets, one localized at each xed point, transforming as (1, 2; 16).
they carry quantum numbers under both, g and g. this is the complete massless matter
spectrum of this compactication. the rules to determine the massless states of heterotic

k3 orbifold compactications have recently been reviewed in [5]. the spectra of some of

the models considered in this paper were constructed in [6]. we note that the dierence of
the number of hyper-multiplets (nh) and of vector-multiplets (nv ) satises nhnv = 244,
as required for a consistent perturbative heterotic compactication.

we want to study this compactication within the context of the conjectured duality
between the heterotic string on k3 and m-theory on k3 (s1/z2)  k3 i. in the latter
description, the gauge elds of g  g are conned to one of the two ten-planes at the
ends of the x11 interval. we will denote them by 10p and 10p, respectively. since none
of the perturbative gauge elds live in the bulk, it is therefore not a priori clear how the
twisted matter elds, which are charged under g and g, can be accommodated in the
m-theory picture. from the six-dimensional point of view each of the sixteen xed points
of the heterotic compactication t 4/z2 is a xed six-plane. in the m-theory picture there
are sixteen seven-planes, denoted by 7p, of innite extent in six space-time directions and
of nite extent in the x11 direction, x11  i = [0, r11]. their boundaries are six-planes
which are the intersection of the 7p with the two ten-planes at x11 = 0 and x11 = r11.
it is here where the perturbative heterotic gauge groups are located, g say at x11 = 0 and
g at x11 = r11. the sixteen intersection six-planes on the e7 su2 side will be denoted
as i6 and those on the so16 side by i6. all the i6 are of course completely equivalent, as
are the i6.

4

from this geometric picture it is reasonable to expect that the 7ps do play a central role

in the resolution of the puzzle with the massless twisted heterotic states in the m-theory
context. they are the only objects which connect both sides of the x11 interval.2 on their
world-volume we have a seven-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory.

for each z2 xed point of the orbifold there is an associated harmonic two-form, the
kahler form of the s2 which has shrunk to zero size at the orbifold singularity. in m-theory
on t 4/z2 the three-form potential c of eleven-dimensional supergravity with two internal
indices and one space-time index has thus a zero mode associated with each orbifold
xed-point.
in other words, there is a u1 vector, and by supersymmetry, a complete
seven-dimensional vector-multiplet for each xed point.3 wrapping m2 branes around the
s2 gives rise to additional massless states in the limit of zero volume of the s2. taking
into account two possible orientations gives su2 as the maximal gauge group. we now
compactify further to six dimensions on s1/z2. this breaks half the supersymmetry
and each seven-dimensional vector-multiplet decomposes into a six-dimensional vector-
multiplet v7 and a hyper-multiplet h7 (the subscript reminds of their seven-dimensional
origin). if the ve-dimensional compact manifold is the direct product (t 4/z2) (s1/z2),
the vector components which arise from c are projected out. this is because c is odd
under z2 : x11  x11 [4].
intersection six-planes. there is no such restriction on the hyper-multiplet components.

in particular, the vector components must vanish on the

the analysis of this model which we present in sects. 2 and 3 as well as the analysis of

other models in sect. 4 requires some modication of the set-up such that we retain vectors

of the non-perturbative gauge group. in fact we will argue that the vector-components
of the full non-perturbative su2 survives on i6 and the hyper component on i6. this
clearly requires a departure from the direct product geometry assumed above to a twisted

product. we must admit that we do not know how this works in detail. we believe

2 our discussion is restricted to massless states. their masslessness is protected by their chirality.
there are massive states which are charged under both e7 and so16. since the n = 1 susy

algebra in d = 6 has no central charge, they are not bps and their masses are not protected against

perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. one may speculate that these states originate from

open m2 branes stretched between the two ten-planes [4]. from now on we only consider massless

states.
3 since h 2(k3) = 22, there are six additional vector-multiplets which are not attached to an
orbifold singularity. upon compactication, their components arrange themselves, together with

components of the metric, to the supergravity multiplet, a tensor multiplet and four moduli

hyper-multiplets.

that the proposed eld content on any of the planes involved, in particular on the 7p
and the i6 and i6, is correct. we give several pieces of strong evidence. rather than

being able to specify how exactly the twist acts, we can only state the eect it has on the

boundary conditions of the h7 and v7 elds. to understand what is meant here, recall
that the presence of the ten-planes, or in other words, dividing by z2, breaks half of the
supersymmetries, 8 of the 16 supercharges which would be present in m-theory on k3 are
even and 8 are odd under the z2. this entails that under the 7d  6d decomposition the
vector and the hyper components of the seven-dimensional vector-multiplet have opposite

(free vs. xed) boundary conditions at each end of the interval. the choice of the boundary

conditions on both sides will be crucial below. as we shall see, we have to impose dirichlet
boundary conditions for the su2 vector components on the i6 and neumann conditions
on the i6. this is to be compared with the u1 vectors which are not associated to orbifold
xed points (see the previous footnote). here the boundary conditions are such that the

zero mode for their hyper components are retained. the vector components are projected

out by the z2 twist. we want to stress once more that we are not able to derive these
boundary conditions from rst principles but we will present compelling arguments in

favour of them.

now that we have introduced the main ingredients of the model from the m-theory point

of view, we can give a qualitative description of how they are assembled into a picture that

is consistent with the heterotic description. this will involve the non-perturbative gauge

groups in an essential way and we will in fact establish that the su2 visible in the heterotic
description is the diagonal subgroup su het

2 = diag[su pert

2 (cid:0)su nonpert

(cid:1)16].

by looking at the heterotic spectrum of the model, it is clear that the charged states
in the untwisted sector live on the ten-planes, (56, 2; 1) on 10p and (1, 1; 128) on 10p.

the major new ingredient in the m-theory description of the model is the presence of

additional gauge groups, the non-perturbative su2s, one on each 7p, i.e. one for each
orbifold xed-point. this means that we have to reconsider the su2 charge assignments of
the elds in the twisted sector. the e7 and the so16 gauge factors are unaected by the
presence of the non-perturbative su2s. the twisted matter elds necessarily live either on
the i6 or i6 intersection planes. as they are charged under the so16, which is conned to
10p, they are located on the i6s, one half-hyper-multiplet on each. it then also follows

that we have to attribute their su2 quantum numbers to the non-perturbative su2 which
lives on the 7p which is bounded by the i6. the situation is illustrated in the gure.

su2. for this picture to be consistent, we have to impose adequate boundary conditions
for h7 and v7. the twisted matter multiplet can couple to the gauge eld only if we
impose free (neumann) boundary condition on v7 at the i6 end of the 7p. as explained
before, this implies xed boundary conditions for h7, which is thus invisible at i6. we
now have to cope with the fact that in the heterotic picture there is only one su2 gauge
factor. this will be consistent with the m-theory description if the perturbative su2 which
is conned to 10p mixes with the sixteen non-perturbative su2s such that the heterotic
su2 is the diagonal subgroup su het
the su2 vector-multiplets v7 are locked to the perturbative su2 on 10p. that is to say

and likewise for the gauginos and at all other xed points.
imposing xed boundary
conditions for v7 on 10p requires free boundary conditions for the adjoint hyper-multiplet
h7. thus the latter is visible on the i6. this is also indicated in the gure.

in the following we will substantiate this picture in two independent ways. in sect 2.2
we consider the heterotic gauge couplings and we will nd that indeed the su2 coupling

7

has both a perturbative contribution, which is due to su2|10p and a non-perturbative
contribution which we interpret to arise from the sixteen su2|7p s. in sect. 2.3 we then
show that the local anomalies on all intersection six-planes cancel.
in particular this
includes quantum contributions from either v7 or h7 and also inow contributions from
the bulk and the seven-planes. this is another check on the assignment of the elds to the
dierent planes, as summarized in the gure.

2.2. consideration of the gauge couplings

factors. v and v are dimensionless constants. for perturbative gauge groups, v = 1  it is
in fact the level of the kac-moody algebra  and v arises at one loop. for non-perturbative
gauge groups, on the other hand, v = 0 and v is xed at tree level. the coecients v and
v are related, via supersymmetry, to the coecients of the anomaly polynomial which
must factorize to allow a green-schwarz mechanism to cancel the anomaly. for further
explanation we refer to appendix b. factorizability of the anomaly polynomial imposes
the constraint

b = 6(v + v)

(2.3)

where b is the coecient of the one-loop beta-function of the d = 4 sym theory that one
obtains upon further compactication on t 2. given the matter content of the theory we
can thus compute v.

the horavawitten theory, at least when applied to compactications on a smooth k3,
relates v to the net magnetic charge k on the ten-plane on which it lives. the eld strength

compactications, i.e.
in the absence of freely oating m5 branes, n1 + n2 = 24 and
therefore k1 + k2 = 0. also, integrating the anomaly polynomial of the ten-dimensional
heterotic theory over a smooth k3 one derives v1,2 = 1
in
particular, if two group factors arise from the same e8, they should have the same v. for
the model at hand, n1 = 8 and n2 = 16. therefore, if the above analysis applied, we would
nd v = +2 for the so16 factor and v = 2 for both the e7 and the su2 factor. however,
using (2.3) and the eld content of the theory, we nd

2 k1,2 and thus v1 + v2 = 0.

b(e7) = 6  v(e7) = 2 ,
b(su2) = 90  v(su2) = 14 ,
b(so16) = 18  v(so16) = 2 .

(2.5)

we thus realize that for the orbifold compactication the horavawitten formulae work
for the e7 and the so16 coupling, but they do not give the correct su2 coupling vsu2 =
k
2 + 16 = 14. as we have argued before, the origin of the additional contribution +16 has
to do with the fact that the su2 that we actually observe is the diagonal subgroup of the
perturbative su2 and 16 non-perturbative su2s on the 7ps.

in the heterotic theory the non-perturbative gauge elds do not contribute additional
degrees of freedom but they do show up in the value for v of the gauge factor with which
they mix. the gauge coupling constant of su het

the non-perturbative contribution comes with an overall coecient one. this coecient
was xed using supersymmetry, which relates v to the anomaly polynomial which gave
vsu2 = 2 + 16. we give further supporting evidence for this interpretation, based on the
structure of the anomaly polynomial, in appendix b.

9

it is now also straightforward to check that the above discussion supports the distribution
of elds that we have put forward. 4 the non-perturbative gauge groups mix with the
perturbative su2 and thus must be locked to it on each i6 intersection plane. for it not to
produce extra massless degrees of freedom in the heterotic limit r11  0, we must impose
boundary conditions such that there are no zero modes, neither for v7 nor for h7. since, as
discussed above, they have opposite boundary conditions (free vs. xed) we must impose
for both, the vector-multiplet and the hyper-multiplet, neumann conditions on one end
of the x11 interval and dirichlet on the other.5 in particular v7 then has free boundary
conditions on i6. the situation for h7 is reversed.

we have already pointed out one dierence between the compactication of the heterotic
string on a smooth k3 and on a singular k3. in the former case we always have v = k
2
whereas this is not true in the latter case for those gauge group factors which mix with the
non-perturbative gauge groups on the xed seven-planes. another dierence between the

smooth and the singular geometry is the fact that whereas in the former case the rank of
the gauge group is reduced, this is not so in the latter. 6 the rank reduction in the smooth
case is due to the presence of a non-trivial gauge bundle with instanton numbers n1,2. on
the orbifold a zn singularity can support a singular zn instanton with instanton number
1/n, which breaks the gauge group without reducing its rank. e.g. for z2, the gauge group
is reduced to [e7  su2]/z2 or spin(16)/z2, depending on the choice of the z2  e8 [8].
for the model considered in this section the instanton number on the e7  su2 side is
eight, i.e. there is one instanton of instanton number 1/2 at each xed point. on the so16
side, we have instead one instanton of instanton number one at each xed point.

3. considerations of local anomaly cancellation

one important consistency condition that the low-energy eective eld theory has to
satisfy is anomaly freedom. this requirement is particularly powerful in six dimensions

since in addition to pure gauge anomalies there are potential gravitational and mixed

4 we should however stress that we do not have a truly m-theoretic derivation of these results.
5 note that the locking condition (2.1) is not exactly dirichlet, but has the same eect on mode
counting for the seven-dimensional elds. both, hyper and vector components, have half-integer

modes only, i.e. no zero-modes.
6 this presumes a zn symmetric torus of generic size and no e8  e8 wilson lines on t 4. in the
completely generic case of asymmetric orbifolds of a narain 4,20 compactication of the heterotic

string the resulting gauge group can have rank as high as 20 or can be lower than 16.

in the massless spectrum guarantees that this anomaly can be cancelled via the green-

schwarz mechanism.

in the m-theory description of the heterotic orbifold we have allocated all massless elds

(perturbative and non-perturbative) to the bulk (gravity and moduli) and the various types

of planes which are present. we can now consider the eld theory on any one of these

planes and since anomalies are a uv phenomenon, we need to require that they cancel

locally, i.e. on any plane separately. in the bulk and on the seven-planes this is automatic,

they are odd-dimensional. on each of the two ten-planes, away from the intersection six-

planes, there are 16 supercharges and an entire e8 gauge group. anomaly cancellation

works in exactly the same way as in the horavawitten theory. the situation on the

intersection six-planes, however, involves new features: here supersymmetry is broken

further to eight super-charges and the gauge group is broken to a subgroup. the issue of

anomaly cancellation on the six-planes has to be addressed and in fact we will nd that it

provides a non-trivial check on the scenario advocated in sect. 2.

we now turn to the evaluation of the anomaly on the intersection six-planes. it gets

contributions from two sources. (i) quantum contributions: they arise from the massless
states which are charged under the gauge group operating at the particular i6 or i6 xed

plane we are considering. fields residing in the bulk, on the ten-plane into which the

six-plane is embedded, on the seven-plane which is bounded by the six-plane and the

elds conned to the six-plane do contribute. (ii) inow and intersection contributions:

they arise from gauge variance of the 11d sugra action. there is a contribution from a

modied bianchi identity and contributions arising from chern-simons (cs) terms. we

rst discuss the quantum contributions. some basic results which we will be using are

collected in appendix a.

(1) bulk elds: gravity multiplet, self-dual tensor multiplet and four moduli hyper-

multiplets. in this work we analyze only compactications with one tensor multiplet in

the bulk, thus restricting the discussion to the perturbative heterotic string. recall that

in the horavawitten theory the gravitational anomaly is distributed evenly over the two

end-of-the-world ten-planes. by the same logic we distribute the contribution of the bulk

the rst term in the rst line is the contribution from the gravity multiplet and the tensor

multiplet whereas the second term is the contribution from the four moduli elds.

(2) ten-plane elds: these are vector and hyper multiplets from the untwisted sector.
we have to distinguish between i6 and i6 planes, as they are embedded in 10p and
10p, respectively, which carry dierent perturbative gauge groups and untwisted matter,
charged under g (for i6) and g (for i6). n = 1 supersymmetry demands that the fermions
in a vector-multiplet have opposite chirality than the fermions in a hyper-multiplet and

consequently they contribute to the anomaly with opposite sign. thus generically

with a d = 7 vector-multiplet whose reduction to d = 6 gives a vector-multiplet and an ad-
joint hyper-multiplet. with the assignment of boundary conditions as specied before, the
hyper-multiplet component contributes to the anomaly on i6 whereas the vector-multiplet
component contributes on i6. there is however one subtlety concerning the precise con-
tribution. a priori the contribution from both the vector and the hyper components is
distributed evenly over the two bounding six-planes. the local boundary conditions how-
ever determine whether they do in fact give rise to an anomaly. this is only the case if the
elds satisfy free boundary conditions. this is a manifestation of the local consistency as-
sumption: what happens at a given boundary is sensitive only to the boundary conditions
imposed there and is blind to what happens at another, distant boundary. in other words,
the fact that each multiplet, due to the chosen boundary conditions, contributes to the
anomaly only on one of the two ends does not aect the amount by which it contributes.
in summary, the contribution to the local anomaly from the 7p elds is half of that of a
su2 vector-multiplet on i6 and half of that of an an su2 adjoint hyper-multiplet on i6.
we then nd

(4) six-plane elds: these are the massless elds which are entirely conned to the i6 (i6)
planes. in the models which we investigate there are no such tensor or vector states and
the only contribution arises from hyper-multiplets which appear in the twisted sectors of
the heterotic theory. for the z2 model considered here the twisted sector contains sixteen
half-hyper-multiplets, one localized at each xed point and transforming as (1, 2; 16). it
should be assigned to the i6 side since it is charged under the gauge groups residing here,
namely (su2  so16). there are no six-plane elds on i6. note that the su2 quantum
numbers should be understood as those pertaining to the diagonal su2 group. we thus

this completes the enumeration of the quantum anomalies.

in addition to the quantum anomalies there are additional contributions which have

their origin in the gauge-variance of the classical low-energy m-theory eective action [10].
more precisely, these inow contributions arise from the cs couplings c  g  g and
c  (trr4  1
4 (trr2)2) in the eleven-dimensional bulk action. here c is the three-form
potential and g its eld strength with (magnetic) sources on the ten-planes and the six-

planes. this produces an anomaly in the gauge theory on the six-planes [10]

f10 are the gauge elds on the ten planes only, i.e. g or g and g is the magnetic charge
of the six-plane. to the best of our knowledge the coecients of these terms have not

been reliably determined. we have xed the normalizations such as to make the anomaly

cancellation work for this model. once xed we use them for all other models which we
consider. 10 below we will give independent arguments in support of the normalizations

in (3.7). the magnetic charges are easy to determine. we have found in sect. 2.2 that

the magnetic charge of the ten-planes is k1,2. in the orbifold limit the geometric and the
gauge curvatures are restricted to the orbifold singularities. hence this is also where the

magnetic charge is sitting. we thus get the following sum rule for the magnetic charges of

the six-planes

gi = k .

xi

(3.8)

the sum extends over all six-planes on a given side of the x11 interval and  = 1, 2. for
the problem at hand k1,2 = 4 and since all i6 are related by symmetry (and likewise the
i6) we nd gi6 = 1
4 and gi6 = 1
4 . we thus obtain for the inow
contributions to the anomalies on the six-planes:

note that these expressions factorize into two terms, the rst of a seven-plane origin and

the second of a ten-plane origin.

consistency of the theory requires, in the absence of tensor multiplets on the i6 and i6
planes, that the anomaly vanishes identically.11 thus, were it only for these contributions
to the local anomaly, the theory would be inconsistent. the factorization pattern of (3.10)

does suggest yet another contribution to the anomaly. indeed, we still have to take into

account the intersection anomaly [10]. it arises from the electric coupling of the 7p to c.
this gives rise to a cs term on each 7p world-volume of the form c  y4 which leads to a
contribution to the anomaly on the intersection six-planes

so far we have presented a consistent scenario for the m -theory description of the het-
erotic t 4/z2 orbifold with gauge group [e7  su2]  so16. in the remaining sections we
will generalize the analysis to other t 4/zn orbifolds.

11 in the presence of extra tensor multiplets one could invoke the gs mechanism provided the
anomaly factorizes appropriately.

15

4. examples of z3, z4 and z6 orbifolds

in this section we generalize the discussion of the two preceding sections to orbifolds
with higher order xed points. in 4.1. we recall some basic facts about t 4/zn orbifolds.
we then discuss one model for n = 3, 4, 6 each. we will stress the new issues which arise

for non-prime orbifolds, i.e. for n = 4, 6. we rst analyse the gauge couplings (sect. 4.2)

and then turn to the analysis of local anomalies (sect. 4.3) of these models. in sect. 4.4

we derive the values for the parameters  and  in (3.12). we give two independent

arguments. the rst is based on a comparison between the heterotic anomaly and the

m-theory anomaly. the second argument does not rely on anomaly considerations but
uses the duality between m-theory on k3 and heterotic theory on t 3. to help the reader
through the discussion of the various models, we have collected the data concerning their

spectra, gauge couplings and magnetic charges in three tables. they can be found in

sect. 4.2.

4.1. some facts about t 4/zn orbifolds

to ensure d = 6, n = 1 supersymmetry (eight unbroken supercharges) in t 4/zn
compactications of the heterotic string, n has to be restricted to n  {2, 3, 4, 6}. whereas
for the z2 orbifold the number of moduli is four, for the remaining cases there are only
two moduli. this follows by considering which of the (1,1) forms on the torus are invariant
under the zn twist. recall that if t 4 is parametrized by two complex coordinates z1 and
z2, the discrete zn transformation acts as z1  z1, z2  n1z2, where n = 1. the
action is such that dz1  dz2 survives, since this is the (2,0) form which we need for a
k3 compactication or the orbifold limits thereof. its presence also guarantees at least

eight unbroken supercharges. there are various ways to embed the geometrical twists as

shifts in the gauge lattice, leading to dierent spectra.

in the absence of wilson lines

there are 2 (5,12,59) dierent embeddings for z2 (z3, z4, z6) with dierent gauge groups
g g  e8  e8 and matter content [11],[12]. the number of xed points is given by the
lefshetz xed-point formula as

(1  )2(1  )2 =

(4.1)

for the other possible lattice automorphisms, n  {5, 8, 10, 12}, the xed point formula
(4.1) does not give an integer. the precise xed-point structure for n non-prime will be
discussed when we consider the z4 and z6 examples below.

much of the m-theory discussion from sect. 2 carries over verbatim to the general case.
the xed seven-planes are again denoted by 7p and they carry a non-perturbative gauge
group, g7, which for a zn xed point is (at most) sun . the intersection six-planes are
again i6 (at x11 = 0) and i6 (at x11 = r11). there is one i6, i6 pair for each orbifold
xed point. for non-prime orbifolds there are xed points of dierent orders. this leads
to new features which we will discuss in detail below. but rst we present another prime
orbifold.

4.2. analysis of the gauge couplings

z3 orbifold:

the discussion here follows very closely the discussion of the z2 orbifold in sect. 2.
we will thus be brief. since this is a prime orbifold, there is only one type of xed
points, namely nine z3 xed points. consequently there are nine seven-planes. they are
bounded by nine i6 planes and nine i6 planes. the i6 are related by symmetry and are
thus completely equivalent and likewise for the i6. two of the four moduli of the t 4 are
invariant under the z3 twist. if we choose  = 1
2 ) as
shift vector, the gauge group is gg = (e6su3)su9. in addition to the states in the
corresponding vector-multiplets, there are twist-invariant massless states which comprise
hyper-multiplets transforming as (27, 3; 1) and (1, 1; 84). as for the massless twisted matter
there is one hyper-multiplet (1, 3; 9) located at each of the nine xed points. this part of
the spectrum and other data pertaining to this model are summarized in table 4.1. below.

given the massless spectrum, it is straightforward to compute the one-loop beta-function

coecients for each group factor and from this, via (2.3), the v, c.f. (2.2). we nd

we thus learn that ve7 = k1
2 + 9.
in analogy with the z2 example we conclude that the heterotic su3 gauge factor is a
linear combination of the perturbative su3 and the nine non-perturbative su3s on the

2 with k1 = 3 and k2 = +3, but vsu3 = k1

17

3

seven-planes; i.e.
multiplets are charged under su9, they must be located on the i6 planes and they carry
quantum numbers of a non-perturbative su3. the boundary conditions of the hyper and
the vector components under the 7d  6d decomposition must be chosen such that the
vector component enjoys dirichlet boundary conditions of the type (2.1) on the e6  su3
side and neumann conditions on the su9 side; i.e. there is one su3 adjoint hyper-multiplet
on each i6 and one vector-multiplet on each i6. this allocation of elds leads to local
anomaly cancellation on the six-planes as we will demonstrate in sect. 4.3.

z4 orbifold

this is our rst example of a non-prime orbifold. it possesses two types of xed points:
four z4 xed points and 16 z2  z4 xed-points. the latter are obviously also xed under
z2 and the twelve remaining z2 xed points lie pair-wise on z4 orbits. there are thus
four z4 and six z2 xed points. all xed points of a given type are completely equivalent.
the two type we have to treat separately, though. the results of the ensuing below of a
particular z4 orbifold model are collected in table 4.2 below.

we embed the z4 twist into the gauge sector via the shift vector  = 1
 7

4 (3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0;

so6)(su8su2) = gg. the massless charged matter in the untwisted sector consists
of one hyper-multiplet transforming as (16, 4; 1, 1) and one hyper-multiplet transforming
as (1, 1; 28, 2). these states, which we denote by h0, clearly live on 10p.

since for non-prime orbifolds there are dierent types of xed-points, one has to be
careful with the allocation of the twisted matter. the z4 orbifold has three types of twisted
sectors. states in the rst and the third twisted sectors combine into particle and anti-
particle pairs and into complete hyper-multiplets, which we denote as h1. these states are
necessarily located at the z4 xed points. straightforward application of the rules reviewed
in [5] gives h1 = 4(1, 4; 8, 1). the double-twisted sector contains both particles and their
anti-particles. these states we call h2. one nds h2 = 10 1
2 (10, 1; 1, 2).
the correct assignment of these states to the various xed points is as follows. at each z2
xed point: 1

2 (10, 1; 1, 2) and at each z4 xed point: 1

2 (1, 6; 1, 2) + 6 1

2 (1, 6; 1, 2) + 1

2 (1, 6; 1, 2).

note that the states at each of the z2 xed points combine into representations of
1
so16  (e7  su2) which is the group left unbroken by the shift 2:
2 [(1, 6; 1, 2) +
(10, 1; 1, 2)](so10so6)(su8su2) = 1
2 (16; 1, 2)so16(e7su2). also, locally at the z2 xed
points, there are four moduli hyper-multiplets. in fact, the local physics at each of the
six z2 xed points of this z4 orbifold is identical to that encountered in the z2 model
discussed before. since there are six z2 seven-planes, we expect vsu2 = k2
2 + 6. we will
verify this shortly.

1

it remains to discuss the four z4 xed points with twisted massless matter (1, 4; 8, 1) +
2 (1, 6; 1, 2). each of the z4 seven-planes supports a non-perturbative su4  so6 gauge
group. this, together with the gauge quantum numbers of the twisted states, suggests
that the twisted matter lives on the i6 planes and transforms as 4 and 6 under a non-
perturbative su4, respectively. also, in complete analogy to the previous examples, this
would imply vsu4 = k1
)4]. that this is
correct can be easily veried, given that

b(su2) = 42  v(su2) = 0 + 6 .

(4.3)

we also nd k1 = k2 = 0, i.e. the 24 instantons are distributed evenly over the two sides.
it is now also clear how to distribute the seven-plane elds. a su4 adjoint hyper-multiplet
lives on each of the z4 i6 planes and a su4 vector-multiplet on each z4 i6 plane.

z6 orbifold

as in the previous examples, the data of the particular model we will discuss in this

section are collected in a table which can be found at the end of this subsection.

as z6 has two non-trivial subgroups, z2 and z3, a z6 orbifold has xed points of orders
2, 3 and 6. the lefshetz xed point theorem gives one z6 xed point which is of course
also xed under the z2 and z3 subgroups. the remaining eight z3 xed points lie on four
z6 orbits. the 15 z2 xed points not xed under z6 lie on 5 z6 orbits. a z6 orbifold thus
has one z6, four z3 and ve z2 xed points. of the four moduli of t 4, two are invariant
under the z6 twist, i.e. we have two moduli hyper-multiplets.

to proceed, we need to specify the shift vector. our choice  = 1

6 (5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0;
5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) leads to the gauge group g  g = (su6  su3  su2) su9. locally
at the z3 xed points the gauge group is that corresponding to the shift vector 2. one
nds (e6  su3) su9 and thus recovers the situation of the z3 orbifold model discussed
above. at the z2 xed points the shift 3 leads to the gauge group (e7  su2)  e8,

20

i.e.

the z2  z6 subgroup leaves the second e8 unbroken. we will discuss this z2
orbifold in some detail in sect. 5. for the present purposes it suces to state the following
facts. the untwisted matter for this z2 model is h0 = (56, 2; 1) and the twisted matter
is h1 = 16  { 1
2 (56, 1; 1) + 2(1, 2; 1)}. since the second e8 is unbroken, all 24 instantons
must sit in the rst e8, i.e. k = 12. finally, the su2 gauge-factor is purely perturbative,
i.e. it does not mix with the seven-plane gauge group.

the untwisted massless matter of the z6 orbifold consists of a single hyper-multiplet
h0 = (6, 3, 2; 1) which lives on 10p. the twisted matter states are h1 = (6, 1, 1; 9): this
hyper-multiplet is necessarily located at the z6 xed point; h2 = 4  (1, 3, 1; 9): there is
one such hyper-multiplet at each of the four z4 xed points; the states in the third-twisted
sector, h3 = 6  1
2 (20, 1, 1; 1) + 5  (6, 3, 1; 1) + 10(1, 1, 2; 1), are assigned to the dierent
xed points as follows. at each of the ve z2 xed points there is a 1
2 (56, 1) + 2(1, 2)
hyper-multiplet of e7  su2. under e7  su2  su6  su3  su2 it decomposes as
2 (20, 1, 1) + (6, 3, 1) + 2(1, 1, 2). this leaves one 1
2 (20, 1, 1; 1) half-hyper-multiplet at the
z6 xed points. to summarize, the massless twisted matter content at the z6 xed point
is (6, 1, 1; 9) + 1

1

2 (20, 1, 1; 1).

the coecients of the one-loop beta-functions and the resulting values of v are easily

found to be

b(su6) = 18  v(su6) = 1 + 1 ,
b(su3) = 36  v(su3) = 1 + 4 ,
b(su2) = 12  v(su2) = 1 ,
b(su9) = 0  v(su9) = 1 .

(4.4)

6 = diag[su pert

6  su nonpert

since the maximal non-perturbative gauge group is su6, we conclude that the value of vsu9
must be that of a perturbative su9 factor. consequently vsu9 = k2
2 and k2 = 2, k1 = +2.
from vsu6 = 2 it then follows that the non-perturbative su6 mixes with the perturbative
su6, i.e. su het
]. the fact that vsu3 = 1 + 4 is in agreement
with our expectation that four non-perturbative su3 factors located at the four z3 seven-
planes mix with the perturbative su3. as for vsu2 we would naively expect vsu2 = k1
2 + 5.
this would in fact be required if at the z2 xed points the local physics were that of the
z2 orbifold discussed in sect. 2. however, as already mentioned above, for the z2 orbifold
with gauge group (e7  su2) e8 we will nd in sect. 5 that the su2 factor is completely
perturbative, i.e. there is no mixing with the non-perturbative seven-plane gauge group.

6

it is now straightforward to give the eld content on the z6 i6 and i6 planes. on i6
with perturbative gauge group su6  su3  su2 there are no twisted matter states. they

21

are all located at i6. since they carry su6 quantum numbers, the non-perturbative su6
vector-multiplet must be free on i6 and the su6 adjoint hyper-multiplet is free on i6.

4.3. local anomaly cancellation

we will now generalize the discussion of sect. 3 to the models of the previous subsection.

in particular we will conrm the relative normalization of the two contributions in (3.7).

z3 orbifold

the discussion of the local anomalies for this model is almost identical to the one given

in sect. 3. one dierence is that now we have only two moduli multiplets. also, when

distributing bulk elds and ten-plane elds over the various six-planes we have to take into
account that we now have nine xed points. with k1 = 3 and k2 = +3, the magnetic
charges of the nine i6 and the nine i6 planes are gi6 =  1

3 and gi6 = + 1

3 , respectively.

22

it is straightforward to determine the quantum + inow contribution to the local anom-

aly on the six-planes to

(4.5)

as in our discussion in sect. 3, this anomaly can be cancelled by an intersection-anomaly
of the form (3.11), provided that we choose the parameters in y4 as  = 1

9 and  = 1.

z4 orbifold

for this model the discussion is complicated by the fact that we have two dierent types
of xed points. as we have explained before, the local physics at the z2 xed points is
identical to that of the z2 orbifold model of sects. 2 and 3. this in particular means that
anomaly cancellation on the z2 six-planes works in exactly the same way as before. when
computing the bulk and the ten-plane contribution to the anomaly on the z4 six-planes,
we must however rst subtract the contribution already accounted for on the z2 planes
and then distribute the remaining anomaly over the four z4 planes.

before illustrating this for the charged ten-plane elds, we will introduce some convenient

notation. we will denote the multiplet content of the charged ten-plane elds which
contribute to the anomaly by q10. this splits into hyper-multiplets and vector-multiplets.
taking into account the opposite chirality of the fermions in these multiplets, we write
q10 = h10  v10. the net number of states will be denoted by nq10 . let us consider the
so6so10 side. at the z2 xed six-planes, the local physics is as in the z2 model of sects.
2 and 3., i.e. the untwisted states consist of a so16 vector-multiplet and one (128)so16
hyper-multiplet. we now assume that the contribution to the anomaly of a z2 six-plane
is exactly that of such a six-plane in the z2 orbifold, i.e. that of one sixteenth of a so16
vector-multiplet and of one sixteenth of a 128 hyper-multiplet. taking into account that
there are six i6 of this type and four i6 xed under z4, we get for q10

q10 =

(16, 4) .

in the second step we have decomposed the so16 representation under so16  so6 
so10. also, nq10 = 1
4 .

23

it follows from the construction of the states in the untwisted sector that all components
of the decomposition of the (248)e8 under e8  so6  so10 have denite z4 eigenvalue,
namely e2ip where p is a e8 root and  the shift vector in the e8. one nds 248 =
(15, 1)+1 + (1, 45)+1 + (6, 10)1 + (4, 16)+i + (4, 16)i  (248). the subscripts are the z4
eigenvalues. here  denotes the z4 generator whose action on a root of e8 is specied by
8 + x2
the shift vector. introducing the function t (x) = x
32 , whose argument can be either a
complex number or an operator, we can rewrite (4.6) as

q10 = t ()(248) .

(4.7)

the justication for introducing this notation is that one can dene a function t (x) for
all zn orbifolds and this function is universal for any given n , independent of the choice
of shift vector. specically,

t (x) =

ering, pi6 t (1) = pi6 t (1) = 1 and 2pi6 re(t (e2i/n)) = 2pi6 re(t (e2i/n)) =

to be summed over.

in addition to the ten-plane elds, on any six-plane there is also the contribution from
the seven-plane elds with free boundary conditions on the six-plane, again with a relative
sign between hyper and vector multiplets. in analogy to the notation introduced above,
we will denote them as q7. the subscript denotes the seven-dimensional origin of these
states. including a factor of 1

if we dene q = q10 + q7 + q6 we can summarize the contribution of all charged matter

16 ) and 2re(t4(e2i/n)) = 1

note e.g. that for z4 planes, t (1) = 1
16 ),
where for the latter we have taken into account that a z4 orbifold has two moduli whereas
a z2 orbifold has four moduli. (4.11) holds for both the i6 and the i6 z4 planes.

(4.12)
this expression is valid for every zn six-plane of any zn orbifold, once q has been
specied.

to compute the inow contribution (3.7) we need the magnetic charge of the six-planes.
it can be determined from the sum rule (3.8). we have to distribute the total charge k
over all xed planes on a given side of the x11 interval. for prime orbifolds they are all
related by symmetry and carry the same magnetic charge. for non-prime orbifolds some
care is required. e.g. on the so10  so6 side of the z4 model, with total charge zero
(k1 = k2 = 0), there are six z2 xed planes with local gauge group so16, each with charge
4 . the four z4 xed planes must thus carry a total charge of 6  1
1
8 each. i.e.
gi6 =  3

8 and gi6 = + 3
8 .

note that there is a minimal magnetic charge any xed plane must carry. this is
in this case there are no

obtained if k = 12, which corresponds to an unbroken e8.

25

gauge instantons. it is straightforward to compute the minimal magnetic charges of the
zn = 1n2
various zn planes. they can be conveniently summarized in the formula gmin
2n .
the allowed magnetic charges are then gzn = g + m
n where the non-negative integer m
counts the number of zn instantons sitting at the xed point.

we have now provided all ingredients necessary to compute the quantum and the inow

anomaly for the z4 model. a short calculation gives

we will be very brief here. we only have to check anomaly cancellation on the z6 six-
planes. the ten-plane gauge groups are su6  su3  su2 on 10p and su9 on 10p. using

for both the i6 and the i6 planes, the quantum+inow anomaly can be cancelled via

an intersection anomaly (3.11) with  = 1 and  = t (1) = 35

26

4.4. common features

we have demonstrated in all four examples that the local anomaly on each intersection
six-plane cancels. this is to say that in the sum of quantum + inow + intersection
anomaly the coecients of trr4, (trr2)2, trr2 and of the term without dependence on the
ricci-form vanish separately. the four conditions for this to happen are:

nq = 122t (1) + t (e2i/n) + t (e2i/n) + 30g ,

(4.17)

in particular, local anomaly cancellation xed the coecients  and  in (3.12) to  = t (1)
and  = 1, respectively. there is another way to see why these values are generic, which
we will now present. it also uses anomaly arguments and it involves a direct comparison
of the heterotic and the m-theory point of views.

in the heterotic theory, anomaly cancellation is of course guaranteed by the well-
established consistency of the perturbative heterotic string. however, by realizing that
the massless elds which contribute to the heterotic anomaly on a given xed six-plane
are precisely those which, in m-theory, contribute on a i6, i6 pair which is connected by
a seven-plane, we can, by comparison, determine the coecients  and .

the boundary conditions of the seven-plane elds were chosen such that in the limit
r11  0 there are no additional massless states. this is reected in q7 +q
7 = 0. also, the
magnetic charges satisfy gi6 +gi6 = 0. we then have qnet  q+q = q10 +q
10 +q6 +q
6
and the rst condition in (4.17) gives nqnet = 244t (1) + 4 re t (e2i/n), which is correct
in the heterotic context without any reference to m-theory.

we can now compute the anomaly on a i6, i6 pair from the heterotic and from the

m-theoretic point of view. the former gives (cf. appendix b)

the seven-plane gauge groups g7 thus have the characteristic of non-perturbatively gener-
ated gauge groups. however, in the heterotic dual, which is completely perturbative, they
are not visible as additional gauge group factors. this leaves two options: (i)  6= 0 and
 is the level of the gauge group g7. this is the situation we have encountered in all four
examples considered so far. the seven-plane gauge group mixes with the ten-plane gauge
group, as e.g. in (2.7). (ii)  = 0: this case will be discussed in sect. 5.

so far we have determined the parameters  and  using anomaly arguments. however,
ultimately these parameters should come from seven-dimensional physics. in fact, we will
now give an independent derivation of the values for  and , which does not rely on any
anomaly arguments.

in m-theory on k3, the parameters  and  enter through the electric coupling of the
seven-plane to the three-form potential c of 11-dimensional supergravity via the term
c  y4, c.f.(3.12) and [10]. the eleven-dimensional origin of this term are the two cs
terms c  g g and c  (trr4 1
4 (trr2)2). however, it is easier to discuss these couplings
from the dual point of view, exploiting the duality between m-theory on k3 and the
heterotic theory on t 3 [1],[13].12

this heterotic  m-theory duality in d = 7 relates the eld strength of c, denoted by g,
to the eld strength h of the kalb-ramond eld b of the heterotic theory and vice versa:
h  g. the moduli spaces of the heterotic compactication on t 3 and of m-theory on
k3 are isomorphic. at a generic point on the narain lattice, the gauge symmetry of the
heterotic string compactied on t 3 is u (1)22 which is also the gauge group of the m-theory
at a generic point of the k3 moduli space. on the heterotic side, the bianchi identity reads

dh  trr2 +

22

xi,j=1

dij fi fj

(4.21)

where dij is a lorentzian metric with signature ((+)3, ()19) which is also the signature
of the intersection matrix of the k3 homology 2-cycles. duality now implies d(g)  dh
12 this seven-dimensional heterotic theory is of course completely dierent from the horava
witten theory we have discussed so far.

28

and thus an electric coupling  c  dh. at special points in the narain moduli space the
heterotic gauge symmetry acquires non-abelian components which contribute to dh, i.e.

(4.21) gets modied to

dh  trr2 x trf 2

i + abelian part

(4.22)

for the m-theory the gauge group enhancement happens at the orbifold points of the k3

moduli space. the additional states which comprise the non-abelian gauge multiplets are

provided by m2 branes wrapping the vanishing cycles (c.f. the discussion in sect. 1). at
the orbifold points the seven-dimensional gauge groups are su 16

from the eleven-dimensional point of view the abelian part lives in the bulk and is

completely broken after compactication to six-dimensions. it is thus of no further interest
for us. the non-abelian part, on the other hand, contributes to the local c  y4 coupling
on the seven-planes as c pi trf 2
7i. the sum is over all xed seven-planes. as far as the
c  trr2 piece of this coupling is concerned, it has to be apportioned between all seven-
planes. the apportioning happens in exactly the same manner as with the bulk anomaly
in previous sections, namely as t (1) trr2. the reason for this is the same as before. the

contribution on a zn plane depends only on n , independent of the orbifold model.

we thus nd that the relevant coupling is proportional to

c (cid:16)trr2 xi

trf 2

7i(cid:17)
7i(cid:17)= c xi (cid:16)ti(1)trr2  trf 2

(4.23)

comparing this with c pi y4i leads to the identication  = t (1) and  = 1.

we should point out that we have not been careful with the overall normalization of
the c  y4 coupling. in fact, this coupling is somewhat controversial since it is related to
the normalization of the two eleven-dimensional cs terms. nevertheless the normalization

must be universal and it can be xed by considering any orbifold model, such as the z2
model of sects. 2 and 3.13

13 if one changed the relative normalization of the two terms in (3.7) one would nd that the
second of the conditions in (4.17) will be modied ( and t (1) will no longer be proportional to

each other), in contradiction with the independent arguments given here.

5. open problems

all the orbifold models we have discussed thus far followed a common pattern from the
m-theory point of view: each zn xed seven-plane carries a non-perturbative sun gauge
theory which mixes with a perturbative gauge theory living on one of the two ten-planes.
the resulting theory contains an sun gauge group which appears to be a subgroup of the
8) but isnt actually conned to one side of the x11 interval. instead, it
g  e8 (or g  e
reaches to the other side along the xed seven-planes  and thats how the twisted states
living on the i6 intersections manage to have charges under both the sun  g and the
g gauge groups.

however, in many other orbifold models, the non-perturbative gauge groups living on
the zn xed seven-planes turn out to be proper subgroups g7  sun rather that complete
suns. furthermore, such reduced non-perturbative groups  or some of their factors 
do not mix with the perturbative gauge group factors but simply decouple from the massless
states of the six-dimensional theory.14 at present, we do not know any m-theoretical
rules governing breaking of the non-perturbative gauge groups or their mixing with the

perturbative gauge group factors. all we have are the experimental data about the non-

perturbative gauge groups implied by the quantum numbers of the twisted states in a score

of orbifold models we have studied in some detail.

we see no point in boring the reader with technical details of too many models. in-

stead, we shall simply present examples of two common problems we have seen in several
models. in the following section 5.1 we discuss models with the unbroken e
8 gauge group.
experimentally, all such models have g7 = (u1)(n1), the cartan subgroup of the sun,
and none of the non-perturbative u1 factors mixes with any perturbative gauge groups.
furthermore, the local anomaly cancellation requires the non-perturbative u1s to have
 = 0, in blatant contradiction with the seven-dimensional arguments of section 4.4.

in section 5.2 we present an example of a more complicated model where the combined
quantum, inow and intersection anomalies do not cancel out for any g7 consistent with
the twisted states quantum numbers. this problem occurs in all models with mixed

perturbative/non-perturbative abelian gauge elds, although it may aect the non-abelian

elds as well. we speculate how seven-dimensional chernsimons couplings may solve this

problem, but a thorough analysis has to be postponed to a later publication.

14 technically, the locking boundary conditions (2.1) at one side of the x11 interval are replaced
with the simple dirichlet boundary conditions anonpert

(x11 = 0) = 0.

5.1. models with an unbroken e8

to exemplify the problems that arise in this class of models, consider the best known
heterotic orbifold, namely the z2 orbifold with the standard imbedding of the spin connec-
tion into the gauge group, i.e.  = ( 1
2 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). in this model,
the rst e8 is broken down to g = e7  su2 while the second e8 remains unbroken. note
that we have already encountered such z2 xed points in the z6 orbifold in section 4, but
let us take a closer look now. the hypermultiplet spectrum and other technical details of
the standard z2 orbifold are summarized in the following table:

table 5.1: the z2 orbifold with the (e7  su2)  e8 gauge group.

note that unlike the non-standard z2 orbifold discussed in section 2, the standard z2
orbifold has v = k
2 for all gauge group factors including su2; indeed, on the e7  su2 side,
we have k = +12 and vsu2 = 6 rather than vsu2 = 6 + 16 = 22. according to eq. (2.7),
this indicates that in the standard z2 orbifold, the su2 gauge factor is purely perturbative
and does not mix with any non-perturbative factors. consequently, no massless states in
this model can be simultaneously charged under the su2 and the e8 gauge groups  and
indeed there are no such states in the standard orbifold.

the non-perturbative gauge group g7 on each of the 16 xed seven-planes must t inside
an su2 (bigger groups are not available at a1 singularities such as z2 xed points), but
because it does not mix with the perturbative su (2), we may have either g7 = su2 or
g7 = u1. the choice of g7 aects the q7 contribution to the quantum anomaly at each

31

end of the x11: given our general rule of opposite boundary conditions on opposite ends
(two avoid non-perturbative massless states in 6d) and the requirement for free vector
elds at either end to form a closed subgroup of the g7, it follows that n(q()
2 for
g7 = su (2) but n(q()
10 contributions to the
anomaly on each side are completely xed by the massless spectrum of the orbifold, and
since k = 12 implies g =  3

each end (cf. rst eq. (4.17)) requires n(q7) =  1

without going into any more details of eqs. (4.17), let us simply state that for g7 = u (1),
the entire local anomaly polynomials a on both i6 and i6 planes cancel, provided (1) all
the twisted states q6 are neutral with respect to the non-perturbative u1 and (2)  = 0 in
the intersection anomaly term, all the arguments in section 4.4 for  = 1 notwithstanding;
note however that  = 1
16 = t (1) as required by the second eq. (4.17). at present, we have
no explanation for the experimental fact of  = 0 except that its required to cancel the
anomalies locally. likewise, we have no m-theoretical explanation for the g7 = u1, only
the brute fact that this too is required to cancel the anomalies locally. the theory would
have to wait for a later publication.

in lieu of theory, we oer a summary of experimental data to show a common pattern of
invisible non-perturbative abelian gauge groups, which do not mix with any perturbative
gauge group factors and dont couple to any twisted massless states (i. e., the hypermulti-
plets living on i6 and i6 are neutral with respect to the invisible groups). in particular, in
all zn orbifolds (n = 2, 3, 4, 6) with an unbroken e8 group15 we can cancel all anomalies
locally, provided: (1) each g7(zn plane) = (u1)(n1), the cartan subgroup of the sun; (2)
none of the non-perturbative u1s mixes with any of the perturbative groups; (3) all twisted
states are neutral under all the non-perturbative u1s; and (4) all the non-perturbative u1s
have  = 0. in addition, many z4 and z6 orbifolds have a locally-unbroken e8 on the z2
or z3 xed planes  and all such xed planes carry invisible u1 or (u1)2 gauge groups,
exactly like similar xed planes in the corresponding z2 or z3 models. for example, the
z6 orbifold of section 4 has such an invisible g7 = u1 on each of its z2 xed planes.

it is easy to see that any invisible u1 gauge eld must have  = 0 for the sake of local
anomaly cancellation. indeed, an invisible seven-plane u1 has no quantum anomalies 
since all the chiral elds are neutral  and no inow anomalies  which involve only
the ten-plane groups or the visible seven-plane groups that mix with them. consequently,

15 there are ten distinct heterotic orbifolds of this type, including the standard z2 orbifold, two
dierent z3 orbifolds, two z4 orbifolds and ve z6 orbifolds.

32

any invisible u1 factor should also decouple from the intersection anomaly, which means

it must have  = 0. unfortunately, this anomaly-counting argument does not tell us how

the invisible seven-plane gauge groups dier from the visible seven-plane groups from the

seven-dimensional point of view, so the m-theoretical origins of the invisible = 0 remain

obscure.

5.2. models with perturbative u1 factors

the invisible abelian groups of the previous section are puzzling from the m-theoretical

point of view, but as far as the local anomaly cancellation is concerned, the visible abelian

groups are much more troublesome. generally, the combined quantum, inow and inter-

section anomalies in such models cancel each other globally but not locally in x11,

a(i6) + a(i6) = 0 but a(i6) 6= 0 6= a(i6).

(5.1)

in other words, the anomalies cancel locally in ten dimensions (which always works in any

perturbative heterotic orbifold) but not the eleventh dimension.

as an example of such anomaly trouble, let us consider a z4 orbifold summarized in the

table 5.2: a z4 orbifold with the (so10  su4)  (e6  su2  u1) gauge group and anomaly
troubles.

note that all data in this table are completely determined by the perturbative heterotic

string theory  except of course for the inherently non-perturbative g7 and q7. however,
the model must have g7  su2  u (1) since the gauge couplings of the perturbative su2
and u1 group factors indicates their mixing with the non-perturbative gauge elds living
on the z4 xed seven-planes. actually, the su2 factor gets non-perturbative contributions
from both z2 and z4 xed planes, hence vsu2  k
2 = 6 + 4. in the u1 case however, only
the z4 xed seven-planes are involved, but there appear to be a non-trivial mixing angle,
thus vu1 = 4  3

2 rather than simply 4.

the question at this point is whether any consistent choice of g7 and q()

7 would lead
to a local cancellation of all the anomalies on the i6 and i6 planes. the answer turns out

34

to be negative in an interesting way: the requirement of local anomaly cancellation does

have a unique solution

i6 intersection plane should form complete multiplets of the (so10  su4)pert  su n.p.
gauge group visible at i6. unfortunately, they dont  cf. the q6 row of the table 5.2 
which means the solution (5.2) to the local anomaly problems is inconsistent with group

theory. group-theoretically, the only possibilities consistent with all the quantum numbers
are g7 = su2  u1 and g7 = su2  u1  u 
1. both choices lead to non-zero net gauge,
gravitational and mixed local anomalies on both the i6 and the i6 intersection planes.

this type of local anomaly mis-cancellation is common in orbifolds with perturbative

abelian groups. generally, the quantum numbers of the twisted states in such models

require some xed seven-planes to carry abelian non-perturbative gauge elds that lock

onto the perturbative u1 elds on one side of the eleventh dimension, say at i6, but have
free boundary conditions on the other side at i6. locally on the i6 plane, there are no f 4
u1
inow or intersection anomalies (since the u1 does not lock onto the ten-plane gauge elds
on that side) but there is a non-zero quantum f 4
anomaly because there are u1 charged
u1
hyper-multiplets (twisted states) but no charged vector-multiplets (if there were charged
vector elds, the group would not be abelian). altogether, the abelian gauge anomaly f 4
u1
does not cancel locally on the i6 plane.

experimentally, in all the models we have studied, a mis-cancelled abelian gauge anom-

aly is accompanied by mis-cancelled anomalies involving other non-perturbative gauge

elds living on the same plane as well as gravity. on the other hand, all anomalies involv-

ing the un-mixed purely perturbative gauge elds do cancel out. algebraically,

a(i6) = a(i6) = p (f7, r)

(5.3)

for some quartic polynomial p in seven-dimensional gauge and gravitational curvature

two-forms f7 and r.

35

the algebraic structure (5.3) of the net local anomaly suggests that it may ultimately
cancel against a chernsimons action term in the eective theory on the xed seven-plane.
indeed, consider

action  z

7p

i7

(5.4)

where i7 is a chernsimons 7form which varies under gauge transformations by a total
derivative, i7 = di 1

(5.5)

which looks exactly like local anomalies on the i6 and i6 boundary six-planes with exactly
opposite anomaly polynomials

i8(i6) = i8(i6) = di7 .

(5.6)

therefore, if di7 = p (f7, r) (cf. eq. (5.3)) or rather di7 = p/(1923i), then all anomalies
would cancel locally.

we are currently investigating whether such chernsimons terms do actually cancel the

residual local anomalies of orbifold models with abelian gauge factors. there are (at least)
two issues that must be addressed. first, there is a question of normalization: gauge,

gravitational and mixed chernsimons terms all have quantized coecients, which may
turn out to be consistent or inconsistent with the local anomaly cancellation in various
models. the second open problem is the physical origin of the 7d chernsimons terms.

all anomalies cancel locally in models considered in sections 24 without any help from
the cs terms, so why should the cs terms appear in other models? at the moment the
cs terms still seem to pose as many new questions as they are able to answer. we hope

to be able to report some progress on this issue in the near future.

6. summary and discussion

in this paper we have investigated the correspondence between perturbative heterotic
e8  e8 orbifolds on t 4/zn , (n = 2, 3, 4, 6) and their m-theory duals. our aim was
to obtain information about the structure of m-theory orbifolds, in particular the spatial

locations of all the charged elds and the gauge groups that act upon them. our main
tools were constraints arising from local consistency of quantum numbers, from the gauge

36

coupling considerations and from the requirements of local anomaly cancellation. we have

put forward a scenario which allowed us to resolve an apparent paradox associated with

the existence of twisted massless states simultaneously charged under gauge groups which

appear to live on two dierent boundary ten-planes. the resolution relies on the mixing

of a factor (or factors) of the gauge group g living on one boundary ten-plane with the
g7 gauge groups living on the xed seven-planes r5,1  {f.p.}  s1/z2 of the orbifold.
the twisted states which live on the i6 planes where the xed seven-planes reach the
other ten-plane boundary thus have perfectly local g7  g charges. thanks to mixing,
however, the g7 charges of those states masquerade as the perturbative g charges from
the six-dimensional point of view, hence the appearance of the simultaneous g and g
charges in the heterotic perturbation theory.

considerations of the gauge couplings conrm that there is a mixing between the non-

perturbative gauge groups on the seven-planes and the perturbative gauge group on the

boundary planes. another conrmation comes from the overall 6d anomaly polynomial.

the most powerful test however is the local anomaly cancellation. here the correct al-

location of all states  in particular the hyper and vector component of the seven-plane

gauge multiplets  to the six-planes where the anomaly is required to cancel is absolutely

crucial. a consistent assignment of states was only possible after a judicious choice of

boundary conditions on the seven-plane elds which projects out the vector components

on one side and the hyper-component on the other. this also guaranteed that there are
no additional massless states in the r11  0 heterotic limit.

there are three contributions to the net local anomaly: quantum anomalies, inow

anomalies and intersection anomalies. given a correct identication of all the locally rele-

vant elds, the quantum one-loop anomalies are fairly straightforward, but the inow and

intersection anomalies involve un-settled issues of the overall normalization. in principle,

the overall normalization of the inow anomalies follows from that of the chernsimons

terms in eleven-dimensional sugra, but the derivation is rather subtle and the result is

controversial. instead, we simply calibrated the normalization by requiring local anomaly
cancellation in the z2 model (cf. section 3), then used the same normalization in all the
other models of section 4; eventually, this normalization ought to be conrmed by a direct

derivation.

likewise, the  and  parameters of the intersection anomaly (cf. eqs. (3.11)and (3.12))

should follow from the seven-dimensional chernsimons terms (which in turn follow from

the m-theory) and indeed the analysis of section 4.4 gives specic values  = t (1) and  =

1. alternatively, we can treat them as free parameters, xed by the anomaly cancellation

37

requirements of each model. according to eqs. (4.17),  = t (1) is indeed universally valid,
but the  parameter is more tricky:  = 1 works for model with g7 = sun (cf. sections 3
and 4) but models with the invisible abelian g7 = u (n1)
(cf. section 5.1) require  = 0
instead. unfortunately, we dont know yet the m-theoretic origin of the seven-plane sun
breakdown to its cartan subgroup in these models, and we dont know how this cartan

1

subgroups ends up with  = 0 either.

a worse anomaly trouble plagues models with abelian factors in their perturbative gauge

groups, cf. section 5.2. in those models, the local anomalies simply do not cancel for any

consistent choices of the seven-plane gauge elds and their boundary conditions at the two
ends of the x11. this presumably means one of the two things: either we dont know how to
correctly interpret such models in m-theory terms or else there must be additional sources

of local anomalies. for example, a chernsimons term in the seven-plane eective action

has an eect of transferring local 6d anomaly from one boundary of the seven plane to the

other boundary, thus possibly helping to cancel the local anomalies on both boundaries.

much work is needed however before we know whether this mechanism really works.

our main conclusion is that the heterotic orbifolds do have consistent m-theory du-

als with identical massless spectra and gauge couplings and locally cancelled anomalies.

unfortunately, while the duality and the local anomalies tell us what should happen on

every six-, seven- or ten-plane of the dual model, we do not understand how it happens

in m-theory. the big mystery is the dynamic origin of the boundary conditions for the

seven-plane elds. in particular, we know that each seven-plane eld always has exactly

opposite boundary conditions on the two boundaries of the 7p , but the m-theoretic reasons
for this twist remain completely obscure. another mystery why the zn-xed seven-planes
carry full sun gauge groups in some models while in other models the sun is broken to
a subgroup; in fact, we are not even sure of the mechanism of such seven-plane symmetry

breaking. we are however quite certain that the eventual resolution of these issues will

shed much new light on the basic structure of the m-theory.

we conclude this article with a few comments on m-theory duals of the four-dimensional
heterotic orbifolds. generally, such models live on ir3,1 (t 6/) (s1/z2) comprising the
11d bulk, xed seven-planes, xed ve-planes as well as their respective ten-plane, six-plane

and four-plane boundaries. the bulk, the seven-planes and their boundaries should behave

just as they do in the 6d orbifolds (modulo orbifolding of their extra compact coordinates),

its the ve-planes that radically complicate the physics. the problem with the xed ve-

planes is that they are poorly understood from the m-theory point of view. we know

that the singular ve-planes in m-theory carry superconformal theories whose excitations

38

include both massless particles and tensionless strings. generally, the superconformal
theories in ve dimensions are associated with innite-coupling gauge theories, but the m-

theory tells us nothing about the gauge group, only the global symmetries (if any) and some
gauge-invariant operators  and these data are quite insucient for the model building
purposes. also, the constraints of local anomaly cancellation on the four-plane boundaries

of the ve-planes are rather weak, simply because the anomalies in four dimensions are
much simpler than in six. consequently, although we have tentatively identied the m-

theory duals of a few 4d heterotic orbifolds, we do not have enough constraints to be
condent in our identication at the time of this writing. this work is in progress and we

hope to present some interesting results in the near future.

in section 2.2, we mentioned that in perturbative k3 compactications of the heterotic

string, the gauge couplings are related to the 6d anomaly polynomial. in this appendix,

we explain this relation.

the anomaly we are concerned with here is the overall anomaly of the 6d eective theory

rather than local anomalies on some singular six-planes. in perturbative k3 compactica-
tions, there is just one tensor eld b, hence the greenschwarz mechanism of anomaly
cancellation works only if the net anomaly happens to factorize in the form [7]:

2

3a = (trr2 x

vtrf 2

)  (trr2 x

vtrf 2

)  i4  i4 .

(b.1)

furthermore, the n = 1, d = 6 supersymmetry relates the couplings of the b tensor
elds to those of the heterotic dilaton , hence the factorization coecient v and v in
this formula also show up in the exact equations (2.2) for the gauge couplings.

the greenschwarz mechanism does not cancel the irreducible trr4 term in the anomaly
polynomial, hence anomaly-free theories with just one self-dual-tensor multiplet must have
nh  nv = 244, cf. individual multiplets anomalies listed in appendix a. consequently,
the net anomaly can be summarized as

2
3a = (trr2)2

trr2 trhv f 2 +

trhv f 4 ,

(b.2)

were the notation trhv denotes the trace taken over all hyper-multiplets minus the
trace over all vector-multiplets. the relative minus-sign follows from opposite chirali-
ties of fermions in n = 1, d = 6 hyper- and vector-multiplets. comparing the mixed
gauge/gravitational anomaly terms in eqs. (b.2) and (b.1), we see that greenschwarz

anomaly cancellation requires

trhv f 2 = x

6(v + v) trf 2
 .

(b.3)

(see appendix c for exact normalizations of various traces.) curiously, trhv f 2 also
appears in beta-function coecients of n = 2, d = 4 gauge theories (including but
not limited to toroidal compactications of the n = 1, d = 6 theories); specically,
trhv f 2 = p btrf 2
. comparing this formula to eq. (b.3), we immediately arrive at

eq. (2.3).

from the m-theory point of view, there is another interesting way to write the anomaly
polynomial as a sum of two factorized terms, each associated with the boundary at the
corresponding end of x11. for smooth k3 compactications (perturbative or otherwise)
with instanton numbers n1 + n2 = 24 (hence exactly one self-dual-tensor multiplet), we
have [15]

(b.4)

there are similar expressions for singular k3s such as orbifolds. for example, the z2
model of sect. 2 has

so16  16trf 2

su2(cid:17) .

(b.5)

we observe that one of the gauge factors, namely su2, now appears on both sides but only
non-perturbatively (v = 0, v = 16) on the so16 side. this lends support to the m-theory
description of this model that we have put forward in sect. 2. we have a non-perturbatively
generated gauge group (su2)16. each of these su2s has v = 1 and they mix with the
perturbative su2 such that only the diagonal su2 contributes in the heterotic description
of the model, i.e. only one su2 is visible. this su2 is however visible on both sides of the
x11 interval.

appendix c. some results from group theory

we collect some group theoretical results which are needed to verify anomaly cancella-
tion. the notation is such that trr is always the trace in the representation r whereas

trf 2 means pa f af a. the normalizations are such that the long roots are normalized to

length 1.
