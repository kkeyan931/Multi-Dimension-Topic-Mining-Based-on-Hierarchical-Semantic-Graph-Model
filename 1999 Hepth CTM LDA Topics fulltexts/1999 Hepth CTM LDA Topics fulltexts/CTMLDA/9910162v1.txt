abstract

we consider the quantum mechanical analog of the nonlinear sigma model. it
appears that this theory cannot be completely embedded in a more general gauge
theory. we show in this paper that it is possible to have a gauge theory that partially
embeds it.

1 introduction

the interest in embedding of systems with nonlinear constraints has been started
with the works by banerjee et al.
[1]. the general and systematic formalism for
embedding was developed by batalin, fradkin, fradkina, and tyutin (bfft) [2, 3]
where systems with second class constraints [4] are transformed into rst class ones,
i.e. they are embedded into more general (gauge) theories. this is achieved with
the aid of auxiliary variables with the general rule such that there is one pair of
canonical variables for each second class constraint to be transformed.

the bfft method is quite elegant and the obtainment of rst class constraints
is done in an iterative way. the rst correction to the constraints is linear in
the auxiliary variables, the second one is quadratic, and so on.
in the case of
systems with just linear constraints, like chiral-bosons [5], one obtains that just
linear corrections are enough to make them rst class [6, 7]. here, we mention that
the method is equivalent to express the dynamic quantities by means of shifted
coordinates [8].

however, for systems with nonlinear constraints, the iterative process may go
beyond the rst correction. this is a crucial point for the use of the method. this
is so because the rst iterative step may not give a unique solution and one does
not know a priori what should be the most convenient solution we have to choose
for the second step. there are systems where this choice is very natural and it is
feasible to carry out all the steps. we mention for example the massive yang-mills
theory [9]. however, for the nonlinear sigma-model (and cp n 1) not all solutions
of the rst step lead to a solution in the second one [10]. the same occurs from the
second to the third step, and so on, making the method not feasible to be applied.
more than that, in the case of the nonlinear sigma model one can not assure that
these higher order solutions actually exist [10]. it is important to emphasize that
this is not a problem related to the method, what may happen is that there might
be no gauge theory that completly embed the nonlinear sigma-model.

we shall address to this problem in the present paper. we try to adapt the bfft
formalism in order to look for a gauge theory that partially embeds the nonlinear
sigma-model. in order to simplify the algebraic notation, we consider the quantum-
mechanical similar model of a particle constrained to move in a n -dimensional
sphere. this system leads (like the nonlinear sigma model) to four second class
constraints. as it was showed in ref.
[10], it is not possible to transform all of
them into rst class. we shall take two constraints of the theory and use the same
choice made by banerjee et al. [1] in the rst step of the bfft method in order to
have zero poisson brackets between them. this is achieved by introducing a pair of
canonical variables. even though these constraints have zero poisson brackets, they
are not rst class, since they have nontrivial poisson brackets with the remaining
constraints. we then make an appropriate use of the method, without introducing
any new variable, to conveniently modify the two remaining constraints in order
to have zero poisson brackets with the two rst ones (even though they do not
have zero poisson bracket between themselves). we obtain a modied system with

2

four constraints where two of them are rst class. this partially embeds the initial
theory. we also study the characteristics of this new system.

our paper is organized as follows. in sec. 2 we make a short review of the bfft
method and take the opportunity to x the notation we shall use throughout the
paper. in sec. 3 we deal with the partially embedding procedure and in sec. 4 we
analyze the consistency of our results by discussing the equations of motion of both
theories. sec. 5 contains some concluding remarks.

2 brief review of the bfft formalism

let us take a system described by a hamiltonian hc in a phase-space with variables
(qi, pi) where i runs from 1 to n. it is also supposed that there exists second class
constraints only since this is the case that will be investigated. denoting them by
ta, with a = 1, . . . , m < 2n , we have

{ta, tb} = ab ,

(2.1)

where det(ab) 6= 0.

the rst objective is to transform these second-class constraints into rst-class
ones. towards this goal auxiliary variables a are introduced, one for each second
class constraint (the connection between the number of constraints and the new
variables in a one-to-one correlation is to keep the same number of the physical
degrees of freedom in the resulting extended theory), which satisfy a symplectic
algebra

{a, b} = ab ,

(2.2)

where ab is a constant quantity with det (ab) 6= 0. the rst class constraints are
now dened by

ta = ta(q, p; ) ,

and satisfy the boundary condition

ta(q, p; 0) = ta(q, p) .

(2.3)

(2.4)

a characteristic of these new constraints is that they are assumed to be strongly
involutive, i.e.

{ ta, tb} = 0 .

3

(2.5)

the solution of (2.5) can be achieved by considering an expansion of ta, as

ta =

t (n)
a

,



xn=0

(2.6)

where t (n)
requires that

a

is a term of order n in . compatibility with the boundary condition (2.4)

t (0)
a = ta .

(2.7)

the replacement of (2.6) into (2.5) leads to a set of recursive relations, one for each
coecient of n. we explicitly list the equations for n = 0, 1, 2,

{t (0)

{t (0)

a , t (0)
a , t (1)
a , t (2)

{t (0)

b }(q,p) + {t (1)
b }(q,p) + {t (1)
b }(q,p) + {t (1)
+ {t (2)
...

a , t (1)
a , t (0)
a , t (1)
a , t (2)

b }() = 0 ,
b }(q,p) + {t (1)
b }(q,p) + {t (2)
b }() + {t (3)

(2.8)

b }() = 0 , (2.9)

a , t (2)
a , t (0)
a , t (1)

b }() + {t (2)
b }(q,p) + {t (1)
b }() = 0 ,

a , t (1)
a , t (3)

b }()

(2.10)

the notations {, }(q,p) and {, }() represent the parts of the poisson bracket {, }
relative to the variables (q, p) and ().

the above equations are used iteratively to obtain the corrections t (n) (n  1).
equation (2.8) shall give t (1). with this result and (2.9), one calculates t (2), and
so on. since t (1) is linear in  we may write

t (1)
a = xab(q, p) b .

(2.11)

introducing this expression into (2.8) and using the boundary condition (2.4), as
well as (2.1) and (2.2), we get

ab + xac cd xbd = 0 .

(2.12)

we notice that this equation contains two unknowns xab and ab. usually, rst
of all ab is chosen in such a way that the new variables are unconstrained. it is
opportune to mention that it is not always possible to make such a choice [7]. in
consequence, the consistency of the method requires the introduction of other new
variables in order to transform these constraints also into rst-class. this may lead
to an endless process. however, it is important to emphasize that ab can be xed
anyway.

4

after xing ab, we pass to consider the coecients xab. they cannot be ob-
tained unambiguously since, even after xing ab, expression (2.12) leads to less
equations than variables. the choice of xs has therefore to be done in a conve-
nient way [10, 1].

a

the knowledge of xab permits us to obtain t (1)

a . if xab does not depend on
(q, p), it is easily seen that ta + t (1)
is already strongly involutive and we succeed
in obtaining ta. this is what happens for systems with linear constraints. for
nonlinear constraints, on the other hand, xab becomes variable dependent which
necessitates the analysis to be pursued beyond the rst iterative step. all the
subsequent corrections must be explicitly computed, the knowledge of t (n)
(n =
0, 1, 2, ...n) leading to the evaluation of t (n+1)
from the recursive relations. once
again the importance of choosing the proper solution for xab becomes apparent
otherwise the series of corrections cannot be put in a closed form and the expression
for the involutive constraints becomes unintelligible and uninteresting.

a

a

another point in the hamiltonian formalism is that any dynamic function a(q, p)
(for instance, the hamiltonian) has also to be properly modied in order to be
strongly involutive with the rst-class constraints ta. denoting the modied quan-
tity by a(q, p; ), we then have

{ ta, a} = 0 .

in addition, a has also to satisfy the boundary condition

a(q, p; 0) = a(q, p) .

to obtain a an expansion analogous to (2.6) is considered,

a =



xn=0

a(n) ,

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

where a(n) is also a term of order n in s. consequently, compatibility with (2.14)
requires that

a(0) = a .

the combination of (2.6), (2.13) and (2.15) gives

{t (0)
{t (0)

a , a(0)}(q,p) + {t (1)
a , a(1)}(q,p) + {t (1)
+ {t (2)
a , a(2)}(q,p) + {t (1)

a , a(1)}() = 0 ,
a , a(0)}(q,p) + {t (1)
a , a(1)}() = 0 ,
a , a(1)}(q,p) + {t (2)

{t (0)

a , a(2)}()

a , a(0)}(q,p)

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

a , a(3)}() + {t (2)
a , a(1)}() = 0 ,

a , a(2)}()

+ {t (1)
+ {t (3)
...

(2.19)

which correspond to the coecients of the powers 0, 1, 2, etc., respectively. the
expression (2.17) above gives us a(1)

a(1) =  a ab x bc {tc, a} ,

(2.20)

where ab and x ab are the inverses of ab and xab.

it was earlier seen that ta + t (1)

a was strongly involutive if the coecients xab
do not depend on (q, p). however, the same argument does not necessarily apply
in this case. usually we have to calculate other corrections to obtain the nal a.
let us discuss how this can be systematically done. the correction a(2) comes from
equation (2.18), that we conveniently rewrite as

{t (1)

a , a(2)}() =  g(1)
a ,

g(1)

a = {ta, a(1)}(q,p) + {t (1)

a , a}(q,p) + {t (2)

a , a(1)}() .

where

thus

a(2) = 

1
2

a ab x bc g(1)

c

.

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

in the same way, other terms can be obtained. the nal general expression reads

a(n+1) = 

1

n + 1

a ab x bc g(n)

c

,

(2.24)

where

g(n)

a =

n

n2

{t (nm)

a

xm=0

, a(m)}(q,p) +

{t (nm)

a

xm=0

, a(m+2)}() + {t (n+1)

a

, a(1)}() .

(2.25)

in the example we are going to discuss in the next sections, not all the second
class constraints will be transformed into rst class. for those ones we are going to
transform into rst class we shall use the procedure above. in order to assure that
these constraints are actually rst-class, they have to have zero poisson brackets

6

with the remaining ones. this can be achieved by transforming the last constraints
like the quantity a above.

3 partially embedding procedure

let us consider the motion of a particle on a n -dimensional sphere of radius 1. the
corresponding lagrangian reads

l =

1
2

qi qi +

1
2

 (qiqi  1) .

(3.1)

using the dirac constraint formalism [4] we obtain that the theory described by
(3.1) leads to the constraints

t1 = qiqi  1 ,
t2 = qipi ,
t3 = p ,
t4 =  qiqi + pipi ,

(3.2)

where pi and p are the canonical conjugate momenta of qi and  respectively. these
constraints are second class. in fact, for the antisymmetric quantities ab, given by
(2.1), we have

12 = 2 qiqi ,
14 = 4 qipi ,
24 = 2  qiqi + 2 pipi ,
34 =  qiqi .

(3.3)

the remaining ones are zero.

following what was said at the end of sec. 2, we try to convert just t1 and t2
into rst class and let t3 and t4 as second class. we then introduce a canonical
pair of coordinates 1 and 2, namely

12 = {1, 2} = 1 .

(3.4)

from the solutions of the rst step of the bfft method we make the same choice
of banerjee et al. [1]

7

t1 = t1 + t (1)
t2 = t2 + t (1)

1 = qiqi  1 + 21 ,
2 = qipi  2qiqi ,

giving

{ t1, t2} = 0 .

(3.5)

(3.6)

of course, this does not necessarily means that t1 and t2 are rst class. they also
have to have zero poisson brackets with the remaining constraints. we notice that
this is actually true for the constraint t3, but it is not for t4. we then try to modify
t4 in order to have zero poisson brackets with t1 and t2. this is achieved by taking
t4 as the quantity a of eq. (2.13). so, the general expression for the rst correction
for t4 should be

t (1)
4 =  aabx bc {tc, t4} ,

(3.7)

where the indices a, b, c = 1, 2 and just correspond to the constraints t1 and t2, and
ab and x ab are the inverse of ab and xab respectively. considering expressions
(3.4) and (3.5) we have

ab =   0 1

0 ! ,

1

then, the rst correction for t4 reads

x ab =   1

0
2
0  1

qiqi ! .

t (1)

4 = 21  2pk(cid:16) pk

qiqi

1 + qk 2(cid:17) .

(3.8)

(3.9)

using (2.21)(2.25) we calculate other corrections for t4. we list some of them
below

t (2)
4

t (3)

= (cid:16) 2pk

qiqi

1 + qk 2(cid:17)2
qjqj (cid:16) 2pk
(qjqj)2 (cid:16) 2pk

1 + qk 2(cid:17)2
1 + qk 2(cid:17)2

411

qiqi

qiqi

,

.

(3.10)

from these results, we thus may infer that the general correction t (n)
should be given by

4

, for n  2,

8

t (n)

4 = (cid:16)

21

qjqj(cid:17)n2(cid:16) 2pk

qiqi

1 + qk 2(cid:17)2

.

(3.11)

to obtain t4 we have to sum all these terms. an interesting point is that the

innite series can be cast in a closed form,

1 + qk 2(cid:17)

qiqi

21

,

qiqi

t4 =  qkqk + pkpk + 2 1  2 pk(cid:16) pk
qjqj(cid:17)n

+(cid:16) 2pk

1 + qk 2(cid:17)2 
=  qkqk + pkpk + 2(cid:16) 
1 + qk 2(cid:17)2(cid:16)1 +

+(cid:16) 2pk

xn=0(cid:16)

pkpk

qiqi

qiqi (cid:17) 1  2 pkqk 2
qjqj(cid:17)1

21

.

this constraint can be further rewritten in a simpler form as

t4 = (cid:16)1 +

21

qiqi(cid:17)1

(pk  2qk)2 + (cid:16)qiqi + 21(cid:17) .

(3.12)

(3.13)

it is just a matter of algebraic work to check that t1 and t2 are actually rst
class, whereas t3 = t3 = p and t4 are second class. this result is what we are
calling partially embedding procedure.

the next step is look for the theory which leads to these constraints. however,
before going on, it is opportune to make some comments. first, looking at the
constraint t4, we could be tempted to simplify it by avoiding the factor (1 + 21
)1,
namely,

qiqi

t4  t4 = (pk  2qk)2 + (cid:16)1 +

21

qiqi(cid:17)2

qkqk .

(3.14)

but this is not a good result because this new t4 and t2 does not have zero poisson
bracket anymore.

second, one could also be tempted to use the constraint t1 in order to simplify

t4. this would lead to

t4  t4 = qiqi (pk  2qk)2 +  .

(3.15)

this is not also a good result because t4 cannot be considered as an embedding
constraint. we notice that when 1, 2  0, t4 does not go to t4.

9

4 the partially embedding hamiltonian

the full bfft formalism gives us the general rules of constructing the embedding
hamiltonian. since now we have just part of the constraints as rst-class, these
general rules cannot be applied here. we try to circumvent this problem in the
following way. let us rst consider the initial lagrangian (3.1) that leads to the set
of second class constraints (3.2). the corresponding hamiltonian reads

hc =

1
2

pipi 

1
2

 (qiqi  1) .

(4.1)

considering the form of constraints (3.2), we may rewrite this canonical hamiltonian
as

hc =   t1 +

1
2

t4 

1
2

 .

(4.2)

it might be opportune to calculate the equations of motion from the hamiltonian
above in order to make future comparisons. these equations are obtained in terms
of the dirac brackets (where constraints are take in a strong way). so,

qi = 

pi = 

 = 

1
2
1
2
1
2

{qi, }d ,

{pi, }d ,

{, }d = 0 .

(4.3)

as one observes, the dynamics of the system is generated, in terms of the dirac
brackets, by the lagrange multiply . to calculate the dirac brackets we need the
inverse 1. the result is

1 = 


0
1
2

 2

0

 1
2 0
2
0
0
0
0
0
0
0 1 0

.




(4.4)

considering (4.3) and using the denition of the dirac brackets [4], we directly
obtain

qi = pi ,
pi =  qi .

(4.5)

the combination of the two equations above and the use of the constraint t4 give

10

qi =  ( qk qk) qi ,

(4.6)

which actually corresponds to a motion over a sphere of radius 1.

let us now consider the partially embedding case. looking at the form of the
canonical hamiltonian hc, given by (4.2), we may conclude that the modied canon-
ical hamiltonian should be

hc =   t1 +

1
2

t4 

1
2

 .

(4.7)

it is important to emphasize that (4.7) generates a consistent time evolution of each
one of the constraints ta.

the theory described by the hamiltonian above has symmetries that are gener-
ated by the rst-class constraints t1 and t2. since the embedding is partial, this
generation should be given in terms of the dirac brackets with respect the second
class constraints t3 and t4. the general expression for the gauge transformations
that leave the hamiltonian hc invariant is

{y, t}d ,

y = x=1,2

(4.8)

where y is representing any canonical coordinate of the theory and  is the pa-
rameter characteristic of the gauge transformation generates by the constraint t.
using the well-known denition of the dirac brackets, we obtain

qi = 2 qi ,
pi = 21qi  2(pi  22qi) ,
1 = 2qiqi ,
2 = 21 ,
 = 0 ,
p = 0 .

(4.9)

it is just a matter of algebraic work to check that hc is actually invariant for the
transformations above and further the corresponding lagrangian

l = pi qi + 2 1 + p

  hc + 1 t1 + 2 t2 ,

(4.10)

where the constraints t1 and t2 have to be introduced because they are not explicit
in the expression of the hamiltonian hc. the gauge invariance is then achieved if
the corresponding lagrange multipliers 1 and 2 transform as

11

1 =  1 ,

2 =  2 

2

qiqi + 21 2qiqi .

(4.11)

let us nally consider the equations of motion generated by the hc. an im-
portant point regarding the embedding procedure is that the obtained theory, even
though having more symmetries than the initial one, does not change its physics. in
other words, the theory described by the hamiltonian hc must be a particle moving
on a sphere of radius one. if the partially embedding we have developed till now
makes sense, this point has necessarily to be veried.

the general expression of the equations of motion is

y = {y, hc}d ,

(4.12)

where the dirac brackets is with respect to the constraints t3 and t4. for example,
for pk we have

pk = {pk,  t1 

1
2

}d ,

1

= (cid:16) t1 +
= 2 qk +h 

2(cid:17){pk, }d   {pk, t1}d ,
(pj  2qj)1 qji

2
qiqi

qk

qiqi + 21

.

(4.13)

since the evolution of the system is also over the constraint surface, one can strongly
take all the constraints equal to zero in the expression above. this leads to

pk  2 qk +h 

2
qiqi

(pj  2qj)1 qji qk ,

(4.14)

where  means equal after using the constraints (weakly equal) [4]. for the remain-
ing quantities, we have

qk = (2 t1 + 1)(pk  2qk)

qjqj

(qiqi + 21)2  (pk  2qk) qiqi ,

 = 0 ,
p = 0 ,

qjqj

1 = (cid:16)2 t1 + 1(cid:17)
2 = (2 t1 + 1)h

(qiqi + 21)2 (pk  2qk)qk  0 ,
(qiqi + 21)2 (pk  2qk)2  i

qjqj

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

qiqi + 21 + 2  0 .(4.19)

12

the combination of the eqs. (4.14)(4.19) leads to the same equation (4.6). it is
important to emphasize that this is achieved without any gauge condition.

5 conclusion

in this work we have considered the quantum mechanical analog of the nonlinear
sigma-model, corresponding to a particle constrained to move on a d-dimensional
sphere of unit radius. the hamiltonian treatment of this model generates four
second class constraints. from previous results, we know that it is not possible to
completely embed this theory in a more general gauge theory with the use of the
bfft algorithm. we have then considered a partial embedding procedure where
the hamiltonian and the constraints have been modied in order to abelianize
just part of the constraint algebra. we have succeeded in obtaining a consistent
hamiltonian theory with two constraints and the hamiltonian itself as rst class
quantities, and the remaining two other constraints as second class.
