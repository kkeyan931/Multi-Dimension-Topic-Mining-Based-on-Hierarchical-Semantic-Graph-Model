we discuss the dynamics of a superparticle in a superspace whose isometry is
generated by the superalgebra osp(1|4) or its centralcharge contraction. extra
coordinates of the superspace associated with tensorial central charges are shown
to describe spin degrees of freedom of the superparticle, so quantum states form
an innite tower of (half)integer helicities. a peculiar feature of the model is that
it admits bps states which preserve 3/4 of targetspace supersymmetries.

in this contribution we present results of work done on studying superpar-
ticle models whose symmetry and physical properties are dened by a super-
symmetric algebra extended by tensorial charges 1,2,3.

a motivation for this study has been to understand the physical meaning
of tensorial central charges when they are associated not with superbranes
but with relativistic (pointlike) particles.

as we shall see, in the case of superparticles tensorial central charges have
dierent physical meaning than that of superbranes. they correspond to spin
degrees of freedom of the superparticles, while it is well known that in the case
of branes tensorial charges describe the coupling of branes to tensor gauge
elds of targetspace supergravity. that is, brane tensorial charges are similar
to electric and magnetic charges of particles.

for instance, a membrane in d = 4 or d = 11 target space couples to a
threeform gauge eld amnp(x). in the membrane worldvolume action 4 this
coupling is described by the wesszumino term

scoupl = zm3

dxmdxndxpamnp(x),

(1)

where the integral is taken over the membrane worldvolume m3 of the pull
back of the gauge eld. as was shown in 5, the membrane charge associated
with this coupling is a tworank tensor of the form

z mn = zm2

dxm  dxn,

(2)

where the integral is taken over the twodimensional surface of the membrane.
using the supermembrane action 4 the authors of 5 derived the form of the
superalgebra generated by the noether charges of the supermembrane. the
supertranslation algebra thus obtained was shown to contain the contribution
of the membrane charge (2) to the r.h.s. of the anticommutator of the fermionic
supercharges

{q, q} = 2(cm)p m + (cmn)z mn,

(3)

where pm is the standard momentum (or bosonic translation) generator.

thus, the worldvolume actions for the superbranes imply that the under-
lying supersymmetry of superbranes is described by a superalgebra extended
by tensorial central charges 5,6,7.

recent analysis carried out in 8,9 has demonstrated that when super-
branes propagate in antidesitter superbackgrounds, the superalgebra of their
noether supercharges gets extended to a corresponding maximal osp super-
algebra.

for instance, for branes in d = 10 and d = 11 target superspaces with
ads geometry the noether charges generate the osp(1|32) superalgebra. in
10 it has been assumed that the underlying superalgebra of mtheory should
be even larger, namely, osp(1|64) which is the minimal simple superalgebra
which contains the supertranslation algebra of mtheory with a twoform and
a veform central charge as a subsuperalgebra.

if the osp(1|32) and osp(1|64) supergroup are related to mtheory, it
seems instructive to nd and study simple dynamical systems whose properties
would be governed by osp(1|2n) supergroups. and this has been another
motivation for our work.

to simplify consideration let us take the osp(1|4) supergroup which is the
isometry of n = 1, d = 4 superspace having the fourdimensional ads4 space

2

as a bosonic subspace (see 3 for the generic osp(1|2n) case). the osp(1|4)
superalgebra has the following form

[mab, mcd] = i(admbc + bcmad  acmbd  bdmac),

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

[mab, pc] = i(bcpa  acpb),

[pa, pb] =

i
r2 mab,

{q, q} = 2(ca) pa +

[mab, q] = 

i

q (ab)

 ,

ab =

(ab  ba),

1

r (cid:0)cab(cid:1) mab,

1
2

[pa, q] = 

i
2r

q (a)

 .

the generators mab form the so(1, 3) subalgebra (4), and mab and pa (a=0,1,2,3)
generate the so(2, 3)  sp(4) subalgebra of osp(1|4). q are four majorana
spinor generators of osp(1|4). the parameter r is the ads4 radius, and c
is a charge conjugation sp(4)invariant matrix.

the n = 1, d = 4 supertranslation algebra with tensorial central charges
(3) is a contraction of the osp(1|4) superalgebra carried out in the following
way. one rescales the so(1, 3) generators as

mab = rzab

(9)

and takes the limit r  , which corresponds to the limit where ads4 be-
comes assimptotically at. then zab and pa become abelian and commute
with q, and the anticommutator of q reduces to that in (3).

consider now a simple oscillator realization of osp(1|4). for this let us

combine pa and mab into a symmetric spintensor generator

m = 2(ca)p a + (cab)z ab

(10)

so that

[m, m] = 

4i
r

[c(m) + c(m)],

[m, q] = 

4i
r

c(q),

{q, q} = m.

(11)

if we introduce a grassmanneven spinor operator , which forms the heisen-
berg algebra

[, ] =

c,

2i
r

and a grassmannodd scalar  such that

2 =

2

,    = 0,

we can realize m and q as follows

m =

1
2

( +  ), q = .

(12)

(13)

(14)

using the commutation relations for  and  it is not hard to check that
q and m represented in this way generate the osp(1|4) superalgebra,
za  (, ) forming the fundamental representation of osp(1|4).

note that in the limit r  ,  become commuting quantities (see

(12)). then we observe that

pa = a

in which one recognizes the cartanpenrose relation implying that

pap a  0,

(15)

(16)

due to d = 4 matrix identities. we thus assume that at r   the oscilla-
tor realization of osp(1|4) may correspond to a massless d = 4 superparticle
with  playing the role of a twistorlike variable.

before contraction such a superparticle propagates in the supergroup man-
ifold osp(1|4) parametrized by coordinates xa, yab and  associated, respec-
tively, with the generators pa, mab and q.

an action for this superparticle can be constructed in a way similar to that
used for the rst time by ferber 11 for developing the supertwistor formulation
of supersymmetric eld theories.

in our case the superparticle worldline zm ( ) = (xa( ), yab( ), ( )) on
the osp(1|4) manifold is parametrized by the time variable  . to construct
the action we pick the worldline pull back of leftinvariant osp(1|4) cartan
oneforms taking values in the so(2, 3) subalgebra of osp(1|4)

(z) = dz m ( )

m (z)

(17)

and contract the spinor indices with commuting spinor variables ( ) which
are classical counterparts of the spinor operators (12) used to realize the gener-
ators (14) of osp(1|4).  become noncommutative upon solving for second
class constraints of the model and passing from poisson to dirac brackets.

4

the action we thus obtain has the twistorlike form

s = z d  zm 
m .

(18)

by construction (18) is invariant under the osp(1|4) transformations of the
coordinates zm = (xa, yab, ) and under the so(2, 3) subgroup of osp(1|4)
acting in the tangent space of the supermanifold osp(1|4). to better under-
stand the symmetry structure of the action (18) we note that the isometry of
the supergroup manifold osp(1|4) is the direct product of two supergroups
osp(1|4)l  osp(1|4)r. by using in (18) the osp(1|4)leftinvariant cartan
forms corresponding only to so(2, 3)r we break rightacting osp(1|4)r
down to so(2, 3).

to be able to analyze the action (18) one should know an explicit expression
for the cartan forms . this can be obtained by substituting an appropriate
parametrization of the osp(1|4) supergroup element g(z) into the denition
of the cartan forms

 = ig1dg  (z)m + e(z)q,

(19)

where e is a spinorial cartan form associated with the supercharge genera-
tors.

in 3 we have found a parametrization of g(z) which allowed us to ob-
tain simpler expressions for the cartan forms of osp(1|4), and generically of
osp(1|2n), than those derived in earlier papers 12,13,14. we have got

 = v

(y)v

(y)h(a)ea(x) + r(ab)ab(x) + (d) + (dvv1)i ,
(20)
(y) are so(1, 3) matrices in the spinor representation, ea(x) and
where v
ab(x) are, respectively, the vierbein and the spin connection on the bosonic
coset space ads4 = so(2,3)
2r ea(x)a is the
covariant ads4 dierential.

so(1,3) , and d = d + 1

2 ab(x)ab + 1

substituting (20) into the superparticle action (18) and making the redef-

inition of ( )

( ) = v

(y),

(21)

we rewrite the action in the following form

s = zm (cid:20)a(ea  iad) + ab(cid:18)rab +

i
2

abd + tr(dvv1ab)(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(22)

5

note that the so(1, 3) coordinates yab enter this action only through the last
term dvv1. all other terms depend on the bosonic xa and fermionic 
coordinates of the coset superspace osp(1|4)
so(1,3) whose bosonic subspace is ads4.
if in (22) we skip the terms with ab we will get the action describing

a massless superparticle propagating in the ads4 superspace 3.

on the other hand, if we take the limit r   then, as we have discussed
above, the osp(1|4) superalgebra gets contracted to the superpoincare al-
gebra with the tensorial central charge, and the osp(1|4) superparticle ac-
tion reduces to the action which describes a superparticle propagating in
n = 1, d = 4 at superspace (xa, ) extended by tensorial coordinates yab
associated now with central charge momentum generators zab (9). the super-
particle action takes the form

s = z (cid:2)a(dxa  iad) + ab(dyab + iabd)(cid:3) .

(23)

this action, which by construction obeys supersymmetry with tensorial
charges, was proposed in 1. the massless n = 1, d = 4 superparticle described
by this action possesses quite unusual features.

one of them is that the action is invariant under fermionic (so called
symmetry) transformations with three independent parameters. the 
symmetry transformations have the following form

 = i ( )
i

(i = 1, 2, 3)

xa = ia,

yab = iab,

(24)

where 
i.e. 

i are three linearly independent commuting spinors orthogonal to ,
i = 0.

remember, that standard superparticle and, in general, superbrane ac-
tions are invariant under symmetry transformations with the number of
independent parameters being half the number of the spinor coordinates of
target superspace. so in n = 1, d = 4 superspace the standard massless su-
perparticle is invariant under two independent -symmetries. as was realized
in 15, in the twistorlike formulation -symmetries can be made irreducible
and traded for n = 2 extended worldline supersymmetry with transformation
properties of  and xa being

 = 1( ) + 2( )(5),

xa = a.

(25)

one can easily observe the dierence between the transformations (24)
and (25). the latter explicitly contain , while the former involve spinors
orthogonal to .

6

the invariance of the superbrane action with respect to local fermionic
transformations implies that there exist superbrane congurations which pre-
serve the number of target space supersymmetries which is equal to or less than
the number of independent symmetries. such supersymmetric states satu-
rate the bogomolnyiprassadsommerfeld energy bound. thus in the case of
the standard superbranes the number of unbroken targetspace supersymme-
tries is not higher than 1

2 supersymmetry of the targetspace vacuum.

for instance, in the case of the standard n = 1, d = 4 massless super-
particle only two of four targetspace supersymmetries are unbroken. while
in the case of the superparticle with tensorial central charges there are bps
superparticle congurations with three targetspace supersymmetries, i.e. 3
4 of
supersymmetry remain unbroken 1.

recently the possibility of the existence of exotic bps brane congurations
preserving more than 1
2 supersymmetry has been discussed in 16. the super-
particle model based on the action (23) is an example of such congurations.
this unusual property is also characteristic of the superparticle propagat-
ing on the whole supergroup manifold osp(1|4) described by the action (22)
3. the algebraic reason for such an exotic situation is that, as we have dis-
cussed above, the osp(1|4) superalgebra and its central charge contraction is
realized in such a way that the anticommuting poisson brackets of the noether
supercharges q derived from (22) is equal to the spinor belinears

{q, q} = m =  .

(26)

the matrix  is degenerate and has the rank one. hence only one of
four supergenerators q (14) has nonzero anticommutator. to single out this
supercharge, let us introduce a basis (, 
i ) (i = 1, 2, 3) in the spinor space
such that (compare with (24))

 = 1, 

i  = 0.

than, in view of (13) and (14),

q = q =   q2 =

1
2

corresponds to one broken supersymmetry and three supercharges

qi = 

i q  {qi, qj } = {qi , q} = 0

anticommute with themselves and with q. hence, qi act trivially on bps
superparticle states and correspond to three unbroken supersymmetries.

7

another feature of the superparticle model with the tensorial charge coor-
dinates is the physical meaning of these extra variables. as the hamiltonian
analysis and the quantization of this superparticle model have shown 2, only
one of the six tensorial charge coordinates yab is independent due to a large
number of constraints. this coordinate takes discrete integer values n = 2s
and labels halfinteger and integer helicities (s = 0,  1
2 , 1, ..., ) of massless
quantum states of the superparticle in d = 4 spacetime.

let us consider this in more detail. in the weyl representation of spinors

 = (a, 

a),

 = (a, 

a), a = 1, 2;

a = 1, 2

the action (23) takes the form

s = z ha a(dxa a  iad

a + ida 

a) + ab(dyab  iada) + c.c.i ,

(27)

where

xa a = xaa a
a ,

yab = yab(ab)ab,

a b = yab(ab)

a b,

y

and a a

a

are the pauli matrices (ab)a

b = 1/2i(cid:16)aa b  bb

b  (a  b)(cid:17).

from (27) we obtain that the canonical momenta associated with d = 4

coordinates xa and tensorial charge coordinates yab are, respectively,

pa a = a a

(28)

zab = ab, z a b =  a

 b.

notice, in particular, that pa apa a  0, and, hence, the superparticle is mass-
less.

the cartanpenrose relation (28) establishes the correspondence between
a pa a and three components

three independent components of lightlike pa = a a
of a,  a. only the phase of 

a = ei( )0
a

(29)

remains undetermined.

if yab = 0, we deal with a twistor superparticle considered in 11,17, its

action being

s = z a a(dxa a  iad

a + ida 

a).

(30)

8

in addition to all symmetries of the action (27), the action (30) is invariant
under local u (1) transformations

a  ei( )a,

 a  ei( ) a.

(31)

this gauges away the phase component of a and establishes the onetoone
correspondence between the independent components of the twistor superpar-
ticle momentum pa and a.

as the quantization of the action (30) has shown 11,17, the quantum states
of the n = 1, d = 4 twistor superparticle form chiral supermultiplets of physi-
cal states with helicity 0 and 1
2 . these supermultiplets are described by chiral
superelds (xa  ia , a).

in the case of the superparticle model (27) with additional tensorial coordi-
nates yab there is no local u (1) symmetry (31). the compact phase component
of a becomes a physical momentum degree of freedom which corresponds to
a single independent component of tensorial charge momenta zab.

so the superparticle wave function in the momentum representation now

becomes

(pa, , ) = 

n=0(cid:2)einn(pa, ) + ein n(pa, )(cid:3) .

(32)

integer n is associated with an independent discrete (or quantized) component
of the central charge coordinates yab, which is the fourier image of the com-
pact phase momentum component . this resembles a dual kaluzaklein
eect when instead of a spatial direction, compactied is the corresponding
momentum coordinate of the phase space.

in the lorentzcovariant form the rstquantized wave function of the

superparticle in the momentum representation looks as follows 2

 = 

n=01...n(pm)1 ...n + 

n=01...n(pm)1 ...n ,

(33)

where  = , 2  0. each component of this series forms an irreducible
representation of the lorentz group so(1, 3) and describes a massless state
with integer or halfinteger superhelicity depending whether n is even or odd.
thus, the superparticle model with tensorial charges produces, upon quan-
tization, an innite tower of massless elds of higher spin. the structure of the
wave function which describes higherspin states is similar to that used in the
formalism developed by vasiliev (for a recent review see 18) to construct the
theory of higherspin elds. hence, the model which we have briey described
can be assumed to be a classical counterpart of the eld theory of higher spins.
to conclude, we have demonstrated that tensorial charges appearing in
extensions of supertranslation algebras may have dierent meaning than that

9

one got accustomed to in superbrane models. they may describe spinning
degrees of freedom of a dynamical system. superparticle models on supergroup
manifolds osp(1|2n) and their contractions to at superspaces with tensorial
coordinates may give rise to exotic bps congurations which preserve more
than 1

2 supersymmetry.

we have seen that the ads4 space is an intrinsic part of the construction
of the superparticle action (22) on osp(1|4), which upon the contraction de-
scribes free higherspin states. it is well known that to switch on interactions
of higherspin elds one needs the spacetime to be of ads geometry 18. so an
interesting problem to study is whether the superparticle model on osp(1|4)
may help to make a progress in constructing the theory of interacting elds of
higher spin.
