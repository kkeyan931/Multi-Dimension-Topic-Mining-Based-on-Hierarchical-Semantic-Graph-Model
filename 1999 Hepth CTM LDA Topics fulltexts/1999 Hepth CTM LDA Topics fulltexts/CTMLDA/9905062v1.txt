according to the superstring theory the low-energy elementary particle models contain
as ingredient the multiplets of chiral and antichiral superelds action of which is given in
terms of kahlerian eective potential k( , ) and chiral w () and antichiral w ( ) po-
tentials. these potentials are found in explicit and closed form within string perturbation
theory (see f.e. [1]). phenomenological aspects of such models have been studied in recent
papers [2]. in quantum theory one can expect an appearance of quantum corrections to
the potentials k( , ) and w (). as a result we face a problem of calculating eective
action in models with arbitrary functions k( , ) and w ().

manifestly supersymmetric technique for calculations of eective action in the theories
with n = 1 chiral superelds was formulated in recent refs. [3][5]. the new approaches
have been developed in refs. [6].

the remarkable features of the massless theories with n = 1 chiral superelds are
the possibilities of obtaining the chiral quantum corrections. a few years ago west [7]
pointed out that nite two-loop chiral contribution to eective action really arises in
massless wess-zumino model (see also [8, 4]).

in this paper we solve the general problem of calculating leading quantum correction
to chiral potential in massless theory with arbitrary potentials k( , ) and w (), w ( ).
since all such corrections depend only on  but not on  they form an eective potential
which can be called chiral or holomorphic eective potential unlike of kahlerian eective
potential depending both on  and . the remarkable result we obtain in this paper is
that despite the theory under consideration is non-renormalizable at arbitrary k( , ),
w (), the lower (two-loop) holomorphic correction to eective action is always nite.

1

we consider n = 1 supersymmetric eld theory with action

s[ , ] = z d8zk( , ) + (z d6zw () + h.c.)

(1)

where (z) and (z) are chiral and antichiral superelds respectively. as well known,
the real function k( , ) is called kahlerian potential and holomorphic function w ()
is called chiral potential [9]. the partial cases of the theory (1) are wess-zumino model
with k( , ) =  , w ()  3 and n = 1 supersymmetric four-dimensional sigma-
model with w () = 0. the action (1) is a most general one constructed from chiral and
antichiral superelds which does not contain the higher derivatives at component level.
therefore it is natural to call the theory (1) a general chiral supereld model. in this
letter we are going to calculate the lowest quantum corrections to chiral potential w ()
in the model under consideration.

let [, ] be eective action in the model (1). within a momentum expansion the ef-
fective action can be presented as a series in supercovariant derivatives da = (a, d, d )
in the form

[ , ] = z d8zlef f (, da, dadb; , da , dadb )+(z d6zl(c)
here lef f is called general eective lagrangian, l(c)
ef f is called chiral eective lagrangian.
both these lagrangians are the series in supercovariant derivatives of superelds and can
be written as follows

ef f ()+h.c.)+. . . (2)



lef f = kef f ( , ) + . . . = k( , ) +

here dots mean terms depending on covariant derivatives of superelds , . here
kef f ( , ) is called kahlerian eective potential, wef f () is called chiral eective po-
tential or holomorphic eective potential, k (n)
ef f is a n-th correction to kahlerian potential
and w (n)

ef f is a n-th correcton to chiral or holomorphic potential w .

here ,  are the background superelds and ,  are the quantum ones. the eective
action can be written as [ , ] = s[ , ]+[ , ], where [ , ] is a quantum correction.

here the arrows mean that the corresponding operators act on all function at the right
side, and + =  1
4d28(z1  z2) are chiral and antichiral delta
functions respectively. the signs + and  at the matrix elements of g(z1, z2) denote
that this matrix element is chiral (+) or antichiral () in corresponding argument. it is
evident the superpropagator (7) depends on background superelds , . since we are
going to obtain the quantum corrections to holomorphic potential we can put  = 0 in
eq. (8).

let us consider a general procedure of calculating the holomorphic eective potential
wef f (). the mechanism of arising the chiral corrections to eective action looks as
follows. according to non-renormalization theorem (see f.e.
[9]) all loop corrections to
eective action can be expressed in form of integral over full superspace. however, it was
pointed by west [7] that non-renormalization theorem does not forbid an existence of
the nite chiral corrections to the eective action. the matter is the theories with chiral
superelds admit the loop corrections of the form

z d8zf ()( 

d2
4

)g() = z d6zf ()g()

(9)

where f (), g() are some functions of chiral supereld . we note that eq. (9) shows
the supereld  is not a constant and if we are going to use eq. (9) we should keep all
terms with covariant derivatives in eq. (8).

it is easy to understand why the chiral corrections can arise only for massless theories.
te factor 1 in (9) can originate only from massless propagators. in massive cases the
propagators looks like (  m2)1 and the left-hand side of eq.(9) will have the following
form

z d8zf ()( 

d2

4(  m2)

)g()

(10)

instead of (9). after transformation to integral over chiral subspace and using fourier
transformation one gets

d4p
(2)4 f ()(

z

p2

p2 + m2 )g()

(11)

since we are going to obtain just potential we should consider the superelds slowly
varying in space-time. it means we take the limit p2  0. it is evident that expression
(11) vanishes at m2 6= 0, p2  0. therefore non-trivial chiral corrections can arise only
in massless theory.
to nd chiral corrections to eective action we put  = 0 in eqs. (4,5,7). therefore
here and further all derivatives of k, w and w will be taken at  = 0. under
this condition the action of quantum superelds ,  in external supereld  looks like

s[ , , ] =

k  k   !

2 + . . .

(12)

the dots here denote the terms of third, fourth and higher orders in quantum superelds.
we call the theory massless if w |=0 = 0. further we consider only massless theory.
to calculate the corrections to w () we use supergraph technique (see f.e. [9]). for
this purpose one splits the action (12) into sum of free part and vertices of interaction.
as a free part we take the action

the corresponding superpropagator is

s0 = z d8z 

g(z1, z2) = 

d2
d2
2
1
16

8(z1  z2)

(13)

and the term s[ , , ]  s0 will be treated as vertices where s[ , , ] is given by eq.
(10). our purpose is to nd rst leading contribution to wef f (). as we will show, chiral
loop contributions are began with two loops. therefore we keep in eq. (10) only the terms
of second, third and fourth orders in quantum elds.

according to (improved) supergraph technique [12] (see also [9]) it is convenient to
associate all possible d-factors in diagrams with propagators but not with vertices and
transform all contributions in the form with a single integral over grassmannian coordi-
nates. since the action (10) contains the pure chiral vertices we should use one of factors
d2 or d2 in the propagators to transform the integrals over chiral subspace into the in-
tegrals over full superspace. as a result one of propagators associated with each such a
vertex contains one factor d2 or d2 less (see [9] for details).

the possible vertices contributing to one- and two-loop corrections have the structure

2, (k   1) ,

1
k  
2
k  2 2, k 3 

w



2, w3, w4, k 2 ,

(14)

there should be also the vertices conjugate to ones (12).

to clarify which vertices actually contribute to chiral quantum corrections we carry
out a dimensional analysis of the supergraphs in one- and two-loop approximations. to
be more precise we nd full mass dimension of the supergraphs depending on number of
vertices, propagators and loop integrations in the diagram.

each propagator of the form (13) contributes 0 since dimension of d, d  is equal to

1/2, and that one of m is equal to 1.

4

each loop includes integration over momenta with contribution to dimension equal to
4. then, each contraction of a loop into a point in -space by the rule 12d2
112 = 1612
1
requires four d, d-factors. therefore total number of d-, d -factors contributing to the
dimension is reduced by 4, and hence each loop contributes 2.

each vertex proportional to w  ( w ) formally corresponds to two d2- (d2-) factors
but one of them is used to transform the contribution of the vertex to the form of an
integral over d8z. therefore each such a vertex reduces mass dimension by 1. one can
show analogously that each vertex proportional to higher derivatives of w , w reduces
mass dimension by 1.

d2

one of factors d2 associated with propagators is transformed to dalembertian oper-
ator when the expression (9) is converted to the form of an integral over chiral subspace.
hence total dimension of the supergraph is increased by 1.

therefore contribution of each diagram has the dimension equal to 2l + 1 nw

  nvc
where l is a number of loops, nw  is a number of vertices w , nvc is a number of vertices
proportional to third and higher derivatives of w , w . by denition eective potential is
an eective lagrangian in limit p2  0. therefore non-trivial correction to holomorphic
eective potential can arise only at

2l + 1  nw   nvc = 0

(15)

otherwise the contribution from diagram can either vanish or be singular in infrared
limit. we note that vertices proportional to derivatives from k( , ) do not contribute
to dimension.

after each pair d2d2 is transformed to square of internal momentum by the rule
d2d2 = 16k2 one factor d2 should rest to be converted to square of external momentum
after transformation of the expression (9) to the form of integral over chiral subspace.
therefore diagram contributes to holomorphic eective potential if and only if the number
of d2-factors is more by one than the number of d2s after transformation of all vertices
to the form of integrals over full superspace.

it is easy to see that one of two factors d2 associated with the vertex proportional
to k can be transported to external line only. since all derivatives of k and w are
considered at  = 0 the acting of d2 to the external line k leads to zero. hence vertices
proportional to k do not contribute to holomorphic eective potential.

now let us consider dierent one-loop and two-loop diagrams. in one-loop approxima-
 + nvc = 3 because of (15). however, for one-loop supergraphs vc = 0, therefore
tion nw
nw  = 3. since each of external vertices w  corresponds to d2, and number of d2-factors
must be more by one than number of d2-factors, possible diagram should contain two
vertices proportional to k  . however, straightforward constructing shows that the one-
d2
d2
loop diagram of such a type should contain a line proportional to
16 12 = 0. therefore
contribution of this supergraph is equal to zero, and one-loop correction to holomorphic
eective potential is absent at all, w (1)() = 0.

1

2

in two-loop approximation one gets the condition nw  + nvc = 5 because of (15).
since the number of purely chiral (antichiral) vertices independent of w  in two-loop
supergraphs can be equal to 0, 1 or 2, number of external vertices w  takes values from
3 to 5.

it is well known that there are two types of two-loop one-particle-irreducible diagrams

5

(see figs. 1a, 1b).

f ig.1a

f ig.1b

however, to consider contributions from diagrams of these types we must take into account
that they can include all vertices described in (14). it was mentioned already that each
vertex proportional to w  corresponds to one factor d2, and each chiral (antichiral) vertex
proportional to n ( n) corresponds to n 1 factors d2 (d2) 1. each vertex proportional
to m n corresponds to m factors d2 and n factors d2.
we note that non-trivial contribution to holomorphic eective potential from any
diagram can arise only if number of d2-factors is more by one than the number of d2-
factors.

the only green function in the theory is a propagator <   >. therefore total number
of quantum chiral superelds  corresponding to all vertices must be equal to that one of
antichiral ones .

now we turn directly to studying of supergraphs given in figs. 1a, 1b. first let
us consider diagrams of the form fig.1a. the only vertex of fourth order in quantum
superelds has the form l 4l where l is a some integer taking values from 0 to 4.
each vertex proportional to w  corresponds to two  and each one proportional to k  
corresponds to two . then, vertex proportional to k  1 corresponds to one  and one
. therefore total number of chiral quantum superelds  in vertices leading to such a
diagram is equal to l + 2nw  + nk  and that one of antichiral quantum superelds   to
4  l + 2nk   + nk , where nw  , nk  and nk    are numbers of vertices proportional
to w , k   1 and k   respectively. since numbers of quantum superelds  and 
corresponding to all vertices must be equal we conclude that l + 2nw  = 4  l + 2nk  .
 + l  2. then, let us nd number of factors d2 and d2 in such
hence nk   = nw
a diagram. the vertex proportional to l 4l corresponds to l factors d2 and 4  l
factors d2. however, if l = 0 or l = 4, number of factors d2 (respectively d2) must
be reduced by one because transformation of the expression corresponding to such a

vertex to the form of integration over total superspace by the rule r d2( d2
4 ) = r d4
(or r d2 ( d2
4 ) = r d4) requires one d2- (respectively d2-)factor. therefore the vertex
of fourth order in quantum superelds corresponds to l  nv d2-factors and 4  l  n v
d2-factors where nv and n v are numbers of purely chiral and antichiral vertices of third
and higher orders in quantum superelds (nv and n v can be equal to 0 or 1 for such a
supergraph). besides, each vertex proportional to k   corresponds to two d2-factors, and
that one proportional to w   to one d2-factor. as a result, total number of d2-factors is
equal to 2nk   + 4 l n v + nk , and that one of d2-factors  to nw  + l nv + nk .
we again note that the contribution to holomorphic eective potential can arise if and
only if total number of d2-factors is more by one than number of d2-factors. then,
nk   = nw  + l  2 (see above). therefore necessary correlation between numbers of d2-
1we note that each vertex of such types corresponds to an integral over d6z (d6 z). at the same time,
one factor d2 (d2) is associated with each eld  ( ). hence vertex n ( n) corresponds to n factors d2
(d2) but one of them is used to transform the expression to the form of an integral over d8z.

and d2-factors is satised if nw  + nv  n v = 1. however, we proved that non-trivial
holomorphic eective potential can arise if nw  is equal to 3, 4 or 5. and nv and n v can
be equal to 0 or 1 for supergraphs of such a type. therefore relation nw   nv + n v = 1
is not satised and diagrams of the type given in fig.1a do not contribute to holomorphic
eective potential.

now we turn to studying of diagrams of the type written in fig.1b. these supergraphs
contain two vertices which have the form l1 3l1 and l2 3l2 respectively. the l1, l2 are
integer, they can take values 0,1,2,3. in analogy with the previous case, it can be shown
that the total number of chiral quantum superelds  in vertices leading such a diagram
is equal to l1 + l2 + 2nw  + nk , and total number of antichiral quantum superelds
  to 4  l + 2nk   + nk . since these two numbers must be equal (see above) we
conclude that nk   = nw  + l1 + l2  3. further, number of d2-factors is equal to
2nk   +6l1l2n v +nk , and the number of d2-factors  to nw
 +l1 +l2nv +nk .
as usual, any diagram can contribute to holomorphic eective potential if number of d2-
factors is more by one than number of d2-factors. since nk   = nw  +l1+l23 non-trivial
contribution to holomorphic eective potential can arise if nw  + nv  n v = 1. this
condition is satised only if nw  = 3, nv = 0, n v = 2. therefore both vertices of
third order in quantum superelds have the form w  3, and nk   = 0. we note that
there is no any restrictions for the number of vertices proportional to k   1. the
possible supergraph satisfying these conditions includes three external vertices w  and
two antichiral vertices of the form w  3. there is the only diagram of such a form (see
fig.3).

now let us turn straightforward calculation of two-loop correction to holomorphic
eective potential. we have shown that supergraphs contributing to this potential can
contain only vertices proportional to w , w , k   1.
it means it is sucient to

that eq.

(24) reproduces the known results for wess-zumino model at w =  

we would like to emphasize that the result (24) dening holomorphic eective potential
corresponds to only massless theory. therefore, the known statement [11] about absence
of holomorphic corrections in wess-zumino model which has been obtained for massive
theory, cannot be applied in the case under consideration.

to conclude, we have solved the problem of calculating leading holomorphic correction
to supereld eective action in general chiral supereld model (1) with arbitrary potentials
k( , ) and w (). the result has the universal form (24) and it is nite independently
if the functions k( , ), w () correspond to renormalizable theory or no.
