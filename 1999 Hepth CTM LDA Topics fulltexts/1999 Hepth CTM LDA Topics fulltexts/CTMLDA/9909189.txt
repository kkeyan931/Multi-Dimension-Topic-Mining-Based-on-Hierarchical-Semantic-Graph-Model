(16) fact, use stereographic coordinates s2, use rational maps r, r : z r(z) = p (z) q(z) (17) well-known produce maps s2 s2 (here p , q polynomials) . winding number map equal degree rational map, deg(r), deg(r) = max(p, q) (18) p q degrees polynomials p q. fact, want restrict simplest maps i.e., map rn(z) = zn (n) = ((1))n or, modulus =: 1/2 phase (1), modulus phase standard hopf map (15) (s, ) (sn, n), := s2 = 4(r2 x2 3) 3 + (1 r2)2 4x2 = (1) + (2) (1) = arctan x2 x1 (2) = arctan 1 r2 2x3 . 4 (19) (20) (21) (22) hopf maps composed like (16) lead hopf index n = n2, n winding number (i.e., degree) rational map (see e.g. , hopf maps discussed). hopf curvature implies b(n) = 2ijk (t n),jn,k (1 + n)2 = n2 n1(1 + )2 (1 + n)2 b(1) , (23) b(1) b(1) standard hopf curvature (11). logarithm factor front r.h.s.

(25). hence, shown that, presence xed prescribed background magnetic eld (4), exists innite number fully three-dimensional solutions system equations (6), (7). still explain n restricted integer values, related pure gauge factor (28). problem gauge potential (29) without pure gauge term singular. explicit expressions mn, (24), gauge potential (29) may rewritten a(mn) j = aj (n 1)(1 n+1) + (n + 1)(t n) (1 + )(1 + n) ,j + (n 1),j (33) (34) chosen (33) regular everywhere ((1) (2) dened (22)). implies n integer, integer n exp(i(n 1)) (and con- sequently spinor (28)) single-valued. further, may compute resulting chernsimons density = (1) (2) ~a(mn) ~b(mn) = 64n3 n1(1 + )2 (1 + r2)3 (1 + n)2 (35) which, expressed spherical polar coordinates (r, , ) depends r, only. integrating (35) explicitly verify relation n = n2 hopf index n. succeeded integrating (35) analytically far, (35) may easily integrated r, , coordinates numerically help mathematica. integrand well behaved numerical integration reproduces integer result n = n2 without showing even small numerical deviation. technicality large n one subdivide range integration , integrand (35) becomes rather oscillatory large n. 6 3 discussion shown that, presence xed prescribed background magnetic eld (4), exists innite number fully three-dimensional solutions system equations (6), (7). further, solutions (i.e., magnetic elds) hopf curvatures hopf maps (16), (20) are, therefore, labelled corresponding hopf index n = n2, n z. background eld (4) crucial, determines inhomogeneous part non-linear dierential equation (25), and, non-linearity, inhomogeneous part (25) crucially aects nature solutions (25). dierently stated, hopf instanton solutions (24) uniquely determine background eld (4). closing, want briey discuss whether possible interpret background eld (4), beyond stating presence crucial existence solutions (16), (20). indeed, (at least) two interpretations want describe now. firstly, let us study following zero modes l = exp(i + ml/2), analogous (28), choose ml = l ln 1 + (36) (and = l = l(1) achieve non-singular gauge potential ml). follows easily (37) l = 2l+2rl (1 + r2)l (1 + i~x~) yl,l(, ) ! 0 yl,l spherical harmonics. words, l higher angular momentum zero mode (with magnetic quantum number = l + 1/2) constructed simplest zero mode (9), see . gauge eld a(l) solves dirac equation j (6) together l may computed easily, magnetic eld b(l) j = 12 + 8l (1 + r2)2 nj (38) i.e., adding one unit angular momentum l changes corresponding magnetic eld 8(1 + r2)2 ~n, precisely minus two times background magnetic eld (4). is, therefore, tempting conjecture background eld (4) somehow related half-integer intrinsic angular momentum (i.e., spin) fermion. course, observation point, mechanism generates background eld still missing. secondly, possible re-interpret background eld ~ab, (4), spin connec- tion dirac equation (6) conformally manifold torsion. generally, dirac operator spin connection reads (see e.g.  details) = aea ( + + 1 4 bc ) (39) 7 inverse vielbein ( case) usual dirac matrices, ea bc spin connection (here , einstein (i.e., space time) indices a, b, c lorentz indices). dirac equation (6) may rewritten form eq.
