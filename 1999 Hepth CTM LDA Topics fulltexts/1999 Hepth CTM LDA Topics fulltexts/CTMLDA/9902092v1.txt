abstract

m-theory suggests the study of 11-dimensional space-times compactied on some
7-manifolds. from its intimate relation to superstrings, one possible class of such
7-manifolds are those that have calabi-yau threefolds as boundary. in this article,
we construct a special class of such 7-manifolds, named as k3-thurston (k3t) 7-
manifolds. the factor from the k3 part of the deformation space of these k3t 7-
manifolds admits a kahler structure, while the factor of the deformation space from
the thurston part admits a special kahler structure. the latter rings with the nature
of the scalar manifold of a vector multiplet in an n = 2 d = 4 supersymmetric gauge
theory. remarks and examples on more general k3t 7-manifolds and issues to possible
interfaces of k3t to m-theory are also discussed.

key words: m-theory, 7-manifold, k3-bration, hyperbolic 3-manifold of nite volume, bundle-lling,
k3-thurston, deformation space, special kahler, degenerate k3, calabi-yau moduli space.

k3-thurston 7-manifolds

0. introduction and outline.

introduction.

m-theory anticipates the space-time to be 11-dimensional compactied on a 7-dimensional
space. a class of such 7-spaces that have appeared in the literature on m-theory com-
pactication are joyce manifolds ([ac1, ac2] and [joy]). many of these manifolds can
be realized as k3-brations over euclidean 3-orbifolds ([li]). a natural extension of this
from a 3-dimensional geometors point of view is to consider 7-manifolds that are k3-bred
over a hyperbolic 3-orbifolds. we call such 7-manifolds k3-thurston (k3t) 7-manifolds.
if one also allows these 7-manifolds to have calabi-yau threefolds as boundary, then one
may allow the base to be hyperbolic 3-orbifolds with z  z-cusps. they form the set of
hyperbolic 3-orbifolds of nite volume. in this article, we construct a very simple kind of
k3t 7-manifolds and study their deformation space.

to make this paper more accessible to physicists, some essential background or refer-
ences are collected in sec. 1. in sec. 2, using a k3 surface x with antisymplectic involution,
representations of a 3-manifold group 1(m 3) to z2, and the technique of bundle-lling,
we construct a class of k3t 7-manifolds that are either closed or with boundary the
t2  x. concrete examples of such are given, with base some
calabi-yau threefolds h
hyperbolic link complements in s3. we then turn to the study of the deformation space
def (k3t) of this class of k3t 7-manifolds in sec. 3. we discuss the kahler factor of
def (k3t) from the k3 part of k3t and the special kahler factor of def (k3t) from
the thurston part of k3t. remarks on general k3t 7-manifolds, some ingredients to
construct them, and some examples are given in sec. 4. finally, we discuss in sec. 5
possible interfaces from k3t to m-theory. the eld theoretical contents when m-theory
is compactied on such 7-manifolds will await future work.

1 essential mathematical background for physicists.

we collect in this section some essential mathematical background or references for the
convenience of physicists and also for the introduction of terminologies and notations.
additional necessary facts are stated in the related sections.

 k3 surfaces and their deformation space. physicists are referred to [as] for a very
nice exposition. a standard reference is [b-p-vv]. degenerations and isolated singularities
of a k3 surface are referred to [f-s], [ku]. [pe], and [p-p]. a-d-e surface singularities and
their monodromy dieomorphism are referred to [di]. see also [a-m1,a-m2], [dol], and
[sc].

 hyperbolic geometry. ([b-p], [c-f-k-p], [c-r], [m-t] and [th1-th5].) a hyperbolic
3-manifold is a riemannian 3-manifold of constant negative sectional curvature, usually
normalized to 1. up to isometry, there is a unique complete simply-connected one: the
hyperbolic 3-space h3. all other complete hyperbolic 3-manifolds are quotients of h3.
there are several analytic models for h3; two of them are particularly important to us:

(1) the upper half-space model :

h3 = c  r+ = {(z, t)| z  c, t > 0} with metric ds2 =

dz  dz + dt2

t2

.

(2) the poincare ball model :

h3 = {(x1, x2, x3)  r3|x2

1+x2

2+x2

3 < 1} with metric ds2 =

4 ( dx2
( 1  x2

1 + dx2
1  x2

2 + dx2
3 )
3 )2 .
2  x2

(cf. figure 1-2(a).)

the group isom +(h3) of orientation-preserving isometries of h3 is the same as the

mobius group psl (2, c) that acts on the ideal boundary of h3

s2
 = 

h3 = cp1 = c  {} = {(x1, x2, x3)  r3|x2

1 + x2

2 + x2

3 = 1}

by linear fractional transformations. note that psl (2, c) is isomorphic to so +(1, 3), the
identity component of the lorentz group.

all hyperbolic 3-manifolds discussed in this paper will be assumed to be orientable.

 developing map and holonomy.
([th1, th5].) given a hyperbolic 3-manifold
m 3, perhaps with boundary, then one can cover m 3 with a hyperbolic coordinate charts
(u,  : u  h3) so that all u, u  u are topologically a ball. the transition
function  =   1
: (u  u)  (u  u) then coincides with the restriction
to (u  u) of a unique element, also denoted by , in isom (h3). fix an initial
chart u0 and a point p0 in the interior of u0. let  : [0, 1]  m 3 be a path at p0 and
(u0, 0), (u1, 1)  , (un, n) be a sequence of hyperbolic charts along , i.e.   n
i=0 ui



2

and ui  ui+1 nonempty for i = 0, . . . , n  1. one can form a new sequene of hyperbolic
charts (ui,  i ), i = 0, . . . , n, by setting

 0 = 0 ,

 1 = 01  1 ,

 ,

 n = 01  12   n1,n  n ,

where i,i+1 are understood as elements in isom (h3). a key feature of (ui,  i ) is that
the new transition functions  i,i+1 have now become the identity map. thus we shall call
the sequence (ui,  i ), i = 0, . . . , n, the analytic continuation of (u0, 0) along . such
continuation depends only on the initial chart (u0, 0) and the homotopy class [] of 
relative to its end-points and we will denote the germ associated with  n by []
0 . (figure
1-1.)

figure 1-1. the analytic continuaion of hyperbolic patches along
a path  (cf. fig. 3.15 in [th5]).

fix a lifting of u0 to the universal covering gm 3 of m 3, with the lifted hyperbolic

structure, then a local isometry

dev : gm 3  h3

can be uniquely dened via analytic continuation. this map is called the developing map
of m 3. it depends only on the choice of (u0, 0) and its lifting and, hence, is unique up
to a post-composition by an isometry of h3. let  be an element of 1(m 3, p0) and  be
its representative. then the holonomy g of  is by denition the unigue g  isom (h3)
0 = g  0. let t be the deck transformation on gm 3 associated to , then
such that  
dev  t = g  dev . from this, one can deduce that the map  :  7 g is a group
homomorphism, called the holonomy homomorphism. for m 3 oriented, one has

 : 1(m 3)  psl (2; c) ,

unique up to the conjugation by an isometry of h3.

these concepts apply also to general geometric structures e.g. euclidean, spherical, or

ane structures, on a manifold.

 ideal tetrahedron. ([th1] and [th4].) an ideal tetrahedron in h3 is a 3-simplex 3
in h3 inscribed in s2
 such that all its faces are totally geodesic. these faces are by
themselves ideal triangles, as indicated in figure 1-2(a). all ideal triangles are isometric
to each other. given an edge e of an oriented ideal tetrahedron 3. suppose that e is
assigned a temporary orientation, then the two faces of 3, with the induced orientation
from that of 3, that contains e can be distinguished as right if the induced orientation
on e from that face is the same as the assigned orientation of e, or left if the induced
orientation on e from that face is the opposite of the assigned orientation of e. there is
then a unique g  isom +(h3) that sends the right face to the left face while preserving
the two end-points of e. this denes a number z(e)  c with kzk being the translation
distance of g along e and arg(z) being the angle of rotation of g. if the opposite orientation
of e is chosen, then the role of left and right for the two faces that contains e are reversed.
thus g is replaced by g1, but z(e) remains the same. the complex number z(e) is thus
called the edge invariant of 3 associated to (unoriented) e. any of these edge invariants
determines the ideal tetrahedron up to an isometry. they correspond to the cross ratio of
the four points of inscription when appropriately ordered. we shall denote 3 by (z),
where z is the edge invariant of some edge of 3, and call (z) the ideal tetrahedron of
modulus z. (figure 1-2 (a) and (b).)

figure 1-2. in (a), an ideal tetrahedron (z) of modulus z is
shown both in the poincare ball and the upper half-space model of
h3. in (b), the edge invariants associated to (z) are indicated.

the importance of understanding ideal tetrahedra rst is due to the fact proved by
thurston in [th4] that any hyperbolic 3-manifold m 3 of nite volume can be obtained
by pasting a collection of ideal tetrahedra along their faces. we shall call this an ideal
triangulation of m 3. since m 3 is assumed to be orientable, one may assume that the
moduli of these ideal tetrahedra lie in the upper half-plane h+ = {z  c| im (z) > 0}.
figure 1-3 indicates how an ideal tetrahedron in such triangulation may be embedded
in m 3.

bounds in d2  s1. then the topology of the new manifold n 3 h (d2  s1) depends

2 the construction of a class of k3t 7-manifolds.

by a k3t 7-manifold, we mean a 7-manifold that is bred over a hyperbolic 3-manifold
with generic ber a k3 surface. in this section, we construct a special class of such 7-
manifolds which are either closed or with boundary component the calabi-yau threefolds
t2  k3. some necessary facts for the construction are summarized in sec. 2.1; the
construction is given in sec. 2.2; and examples are provided in sec. 2.3.

2.1 the two ingredients: k3 surfaces with involution and hyperbolic

3-manifolds of nite volume.

some necessary facts for the construction are summarized in this subsection. readers are
referred to [bo], [g-w], [ni4], [vo] for k3 surfaces with antisymplectic involution and to
[b-p], [th1] for hyperbolic 3-manifolds of nite volume.

k3 surfaces with antisymplectic involution..

let x be a k3 surface with an involution  that acts by (1) on the holomorphic 2-form
of x. let  be the set of xed points of . then  is a disjoint union of smooth complex
curves in x that fall into one of the following three situations classied by nikulin ([ni4]):

(1)  is empty;
(2)  = c1  c1, where c1 and c1 are both elliptic curves;
(3)  = cg + e1 +  + ek. where cg is a curve of genus g and ei are rational

curves.

and these complex curves descend isomorphically to complex curves (also denoted by  )
in x/. in all cases, the quotient x/ is a smooth complex surface. the deformation space
of the complex structures of such k3 surface was discussed in [dol] and [g-w] and will be
addressed in sec. 3.2.

a quick tour on hyperbolic 3-manifolds of nite volume.

the mostows rigidity theorem says that a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold m 3 of nite
volume with a xed fundamental group is unique up to isometries. however, it turns out
to be more fruitful to think of m 3 as obtained from the canonical lling of a compact
hyperbolic 3-manifold n 3 with toroidal boundary. for example, one may take n 3 to be
the thick part

m 3
[,) = { p  m 3 | there is a ball of radius  embedded in m 3 with center at p}

of m 3 for some  small enough. while the hyperbolic structure of m 3 does not allow
deformation, the hyperbolic structure on n 3 does and the deformation space has complex

6

dimension the number of components of n 3 (if one neglects the boundary behaviors).
furthermore, when n 3 is deformed to another hyperbolic 3-manifold n 3 with boundary,
n 3 can be canonically lled and may lead to another complete hyperbolic 3-manifold
m 3 of nite volume with dierent topology. this gives a certain hierarchical structure
on the space h of complete hyperbolic 3-manifolds of nite volume. with an appropriate
topology dened on h, the volume function vol on h is continuous and nite-to-one. its
image is a countable well-ordered subset (i.e. every subset has a smallest element) in r>0.
these are results in the so-called jrgensen-thurston theory of hyperbolic 3-manifold of
nite volume. for our purpose, let us explain more detail of the canonical lling. the
deformation space of hyperbolic structures on n 3 will be addressed in sec. 3.3.

recall the upper half-space model c  r+ for h3 from sec. 1. let n 3 be a compact
hyperbolic 3-manifold with toroidal boundary. the hyperbolic structure on n 3 induces a
holonomy map

 : 1(n 3)  psl (2; c) .

let t2 be a boundary component of n 3. then (1(t)) is an abelian subgroup in
psl (2; c). thus elements in (1(t2)) must share the same set of xed points on s2
.
furthermore the number of xed points can only be either one or two.

if (1(t2)) has only one xed point on s2

, after conjugation one may assume that it
is . then (1(t2)) is a rank 2 lattice in the translation group of c. the corresponding
boundary of n 3 can be lled by the innite cusp t2  r+, geometrically modelled on the
quotient

{(z, t)| z  c, t  h}/z  z + c1, z  z + c2

where {z  z + c1, z  z + c2} is a set of generators of (1(t2)) and h depends by the
hyperbolic structure of n 3 around that boundary (figure 2-2(a)). note that this gives
an euclidean structure on the corresponding t2-boundary of n 3.

if (1(t2)) has two xed points on s2

, after conjugation one may assume that they
are 0 and . then (1(t2)) is an abelian subgroup in gl (1; c) = c. the lifted
holonomy map of |1(t2)

e : 1(t2)  gc ,

where gc is the universal covering group of c, is now discrete and injective and gives an
complex ane structure on the corresponding t2-boundary of n 3. let n be the closed
-neighborhood of the t-axis in h3 with the t-axis deleted and fn be the universal covering
of n, equipped with the lifted hyperbolic structure. then e(1(t2)) acts freely on fn
as a group of isometries. this action extends to the metric completion fn of fn. the
corresponding boundary of n 3 can then be lled by fn/e(1(t2)) for some  depending

on the hyperbolic structure of n 3 around that boundary. (figure 2-1.)

after performing the above canonical lling to every boundary of n 3, the resulting 3-
space w 3 is hyperbolic of nite volume and metrically complete. however, it may acquire
some non-manifold point or curvature defect from the second type of lling. let us next
turn to these possible singularities.

from a complete hyperbolic m 3 of nite volume at the start of the tour. assume that the
deformed n 3 is lled either by innite cusps or solid torus in case (ii) with  = 2. then
the underlying topology of m 3 is a 3-manifold obtained from n 3 by performing a dehn
lling on the boundary. such m 3 is said to be obtained from m 3 by a hyperbolic surgery.
the following fact is due to thurston ([th1], see also [b-p]):

performong a (pi, qi)-dehn surgery on the i-th cusp, where (pi, qi) is a pair of coprime
integers or the symbol  if the i-th cusp is left unsurgered. then m 3
(p1,q1; ;ph,qh) admits
a hyperbolic structure if all (pi, qi) are close to  in (z  z)  {}.
this is an important theorem that gives a hierarchical structure on th space h of hyperbolic
3-manifolds of nite volume and is good to keep in mind when considering such 3-manifolds.

2.2 the construction of k3t 7-manifolds by bundle-lling.

let m 3 be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold of nite volume, x be a k3 surface with
antisymplectic involution , and  be the set of xed points of . let  = 1(m 3) and

x :   h i = z2 be a representation. then the universal covering gm 3 of m 3 is h3
and ( , x ()) acts freely on h3  x by the diagonal action. consequently, one obtains
a k3t 7-manifold

 : m 7 = m 3 x x = (h3  x)/( , x ( ))  m 3 .

in this case,  is a k3-bundle over m 3. note that x can be regarded as an element in
h 1(m 3; z2) and vice versa. the isometry group of m 3 (in general it is trivial) acts on
h 1(m 3; z2), the quotient labels then a class of k3t 7-manifolds with ber x that are
naturally associated to m 3. thurstons work on hyperbolic 3-manifolds of nite volume
suggests a way to construct a family of k3t descendants from any such  by bundle-
lling, as we shall now explain.

the basic idea.

9

regard m 3 as a lling of some compact n 3 with toroidal boundary. the hyperbolic
structure on n 3 can be regarded as a collection of local hyperbolic charts

{  : u  h3 |   some index set i } ,

where {u |   i} is a covering of n 3. deformation of hyperbolic structures on n 3
can then be thought of as shuings of these local charts. this leads to alteration of
the transition functions {} between charts and also the corresponding representation
1(n 3) =   psl (2; c).
now choose {u |   i} to be also a local trivialization of . let (, h) be the
transition function between u  x and u  x. then, by construction, one can choose
h to be either the identity map idx or the involution  on x. when one deforms the
hyperbolic structure on n 3,  get changed but the corresponding h can be left the
same. this leads to a new bundle  topologically equivalent to |n 3. let m 3 be the
lling of the deformed n 3, following thurston. as will be explained below, the lling of
n 3 to m 3 induces a lling of |n 3 to a k3-bration  : w 7  m 3 in a way that depends
only on the hyperbolic structure on n 3 and x . by understanding these llings and how
the resulting singularities of w 7 can be resolved, one obtains a k3t 7-manifold m 7 that
descends from .

n 3. recall , e, and  from sec. 2.1.
, this boundary t2 is lled to a cusp
c = t2  r+ in m 3. let c be the corresponding cusp in m 3, then the restriction of  to
a collar of t2 in n 3 extends to |c  that is the pullback of |c via a quasi-isometry from
c to c. in this case, |c  is topologically equivalent to |c.
, then the restriction of  over a collar of t2
in n 3 extends to

has respectively

multiplicity 2. if x(1(t2)) = {idx}, then the extended  over fn/e(1(t2)) is a

trivial bration and x = x is a regular ber.

10

 case (ii ) : (1(t2)) is discrete in r>0. recall the core loop  of fn/e(1(t2)).
then the ber of  over  is xc = x/x (1). if x(1) = , then xc = x/ is an
exceptional ber of multiplicity 2. if x (1) = id, then xc = x is a regular ber.
thus, after lling |n 3 over all the boundary t2 of n 3, one obtains a at k3-bration

 : w 7  m 3 .

by construction, if one regards m 3 as embedded in m 3, then the monodromy of |m 3 is
the same as the monodromy of . this w 7 in general is not a manifold. let us now turn
to its singularities.

the singular locus of w 7 and its resolution.

let s be the singular set s of w 7, that consists of all the non-manifold points of w 7. then,
from previous discussion, s sits only over the dierence m 3m 3, which is a disjoint union
of nitely many points p and simple loops  obtained from lling the deformed hyperbolic
structure of n 3. let s0 be a component of s and ( ) be the tubular neighborhood of a
subset in w 7. we shall discuss rst the topology of (1(p)) and (1()), and then
s0 and how s0 may be resolved.
in the following discussions, t2 is the boundary component of n 3 involved. also, we
shall denote the cone over a base b by cone (b) and the 2-dimensional hyperbolic cone
with cone angle  by d2
 .

the two cases are as follows:

case (a) : over p in case (i ) above. there are two situations:
1. x (1(t2)) = {idx}. then 1(p) = x and (1(p)) = x  cone (t2). thus

s0 = 1(p) = x.

2. x (1(t2)) = hi. then 1(p) = x/. let 0  1(t2) generate the image of

 t2 such that x  (1(t2

x . then there is a double covering  : t2
trivial. let h be the nontrivial deck transformation on t2
 x)/(h, ), which is bered over 1(p) with generic ber t2
(1(p)) = (t2
and exceptional ber t2 = t2
/h of multiplicity 2 over  . consequently, (1(p))
is a cone (t2
)-bration over x/. with exceptional cone (t2)-ber of multiplicity 2

orbifold fundamental group orb

(s0), is the extension of h on t2

to cone (t2

case (b) : over  in case (ii ) above. there are three situations:
1. x (1(t2)) = {idx} : then 1() = x   and (1()) = (x  )  d2

.

| arg 1|

thus s0 is empty.

11

2. x (1) =  and x(2) = idx : then 1() = x/  . let c = fn/e(1(t2)).
then there is a double branched covering  : c  c branched over the core  of
c such that the pullback bration (|c) is trivial over c. the total space of
(|c) is c  x. let h be the nontrivial deck transformation on c associated to
. since (1()) is the total space of |c, one has (1()) = ( c  x)/(h, ),
where the action is diagonal. thus (1()) bers over 1() with generic ber

with multiplicity 2. this shows that (1()) has transverse a1-singularities along
   and that s0 =   .

. the exceptional bers lie over    and each is isometric to d2

3. x (1) = idx and x(2) =  : then 1() = x, the mapping torus of x associ-
ated to . analogous to the previous situation, there is a double covering  : c  c,
induced by a double covering s1  , such that the pullback bration (|c) is
trivial over c. the total space of (|c) is c  x. let h be the nontrivial deck
transformation on c associated to . then (1()) = ( c  x)/(h, ), where the
action is diagonal. thus (1()) is a regular beration over 1() with ber
d2

note that, for the situation x(1) = x(2) = , one can replace 2 by 2  1 and
render it situation (2) above.

and s0 is empty.

thus, if case (i) happens for some boundary of n 3, then, from case (a), w 7 can
never be a manifold. nor is there any known standard way to resolve such singularities.
on the other hand, if case (ii) happens for all the boundary components of n 3,
both case (b-1) and case (b-3) above lead only to manifold-points in w 7, while the a1-
singularities in case (b-2) can be resolved by transverse blowups along s0 =    (cf.
remark 2.2.1). after, resolving the singularities, one obtains then a k3t 7-manifolds

: m 7  m 3 .

e

when case (b-2) happens, the exceptional ber of e over a point in the corresponding  is
then x/  ( cp1), where the two components intersect along  . over the complement
of such , e is the same as .

remark 2.2.1 [hierarchy of k3t]. for a xed (x, ) and x , the space w 7 obtained by
bundle-lling is determined by the hyperbolic structure on n 3. thus the associated space
of k3t 7-manifolds also exhibit a hierarchical structure inherited from that on the space
of hyperbolic 3-manifolds of nite volume. however, notice that, when case (b-2) hap-
pens, the set of isotopy classes of identications of c with   c is parametrized by
1(gl (1; c)) = z. non-isotopic identications may lead to non-homeomorphic m 7 from
the same w 7.

2.3 examples from the link complements in s3.

in [th4], thurston showed that the interior of a compact 3-manifold m 3 is hyperbolic if
and only if m 3 is prime, homotopically atoroidal, and not homeomorphic to the quotient
(t2 i)/z2, where the z2 acts on t2 as the covering group of t2 over the klein bottle and
on the interval i = [0, 1] by the reection with respect to 1
2 . a corollary of this is that a
knot k in s3 is hyperbolic if and only if k is neither a satellite nor a torus knot ([th2]).
combined with fact 2.1.1.1 in sec. 2.1 and the construction in sec. 2.2, this shows that
there are abundant of nontrivial closed k3t 7-manifolds.

to construct nontrivial k3t 7-manifolds that have the calabi-yau threefold t2x as a
boundary component, let l be a link of k many components in s3 such that its complement
s3  l admits a complete hyperbolic structure. from the theorem of thurston mentioned
in the beginning of the previous paragraph, there are plenty of such l in s3 and their
complement provide us with basic examples of complete hyperbolic 3-manifolds of nite
volume. it is a basic fact, following the alexander duality and the universal coecient
theorem [mun], that h 1(s3l; z2) = k z2 is generated by taking the z2-reduction of the
linking number with respect to a component of l. thus there are 2k-many homomorphisms
x from 1(s3  l) to hi. from the mostows rigidity theorem, unless s3  l admits a
nontrivial group of isometries, distinct x gives rise to non-isomorphic k3-bundles

 : (s3  l) x x  m 3 = s3  l .

applying the deformation and lling in sec. 2.2 to , one generates then many other
examples of k3t 7-manifolds. by choosing x so that its restriction to the unsurgered
t2-boundary of s3  l is trivial, one then obtains many examples of nontrivial k3t
7-manifolds with boundary component t2  x.
let us now give some examples to illuminate the discussions. the detail of the hyper-
bolic structure of the knot/link complements that appear in these examples is in [th1].

example 2.3.1 [closed k3t via gure-8 knot]. let k be the gure-8 knot in s3, as
shown in figure 2-3-1.

k

then s3  k is hyperbolic and h 1(s3  k; z2) = z2. let m be the meridian and l be
the longitude of k. thurston proves that (theorem 4.7 in [th1]) every manifold obtained
by dehn surgery along gure-8 knot has a hyperbolic structure, except the six manifolds
(s3  k)(a,b) where (a, b) = (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), or (4, 1).

and

for 0, (s3  k) 0 x = (s3  k)  x and the deform-and-ll procedure applied to
(s3  k)  x only yields k3t 7-manifolds in the product form m 3  x.
for 1, if a  0 (mod 2), then either case (b-1) or case (b-3) happens and the deform-
and-ll procedure applied to (s3  k) 1 x yields directly closed k3t 7-manifolds. if
a  1 (mod 2), then case (b-2) happens and the deform-and-ll applied to (s3 k)1 x
yields k3t 7-spaces with a1-singularities. after blowups, this yields also closed k3t
7-manifolds.



example 2.3.2 [k3t with boundary t2 x via whitehead link]. let l = k1 k2
be the whitehead link in s3, as shown in figure 2-3-2. then s3  l is hyperbolic and

the elements in h 1(s3  l; z2) are

12 : mi

where 1, 2 is 0 or 1. to obtain a k3t 7-manifold with boundary t2  x, one considers
either (s3  l) 01 x with (a1, b1) =  or (s3  l) 10 x with (a2, b2) = . in the
former case, if a2  0 (mod 2), then either case (b-1) or case (b-3) happens and the
deform-and-ll procedure applied to (s3  k) 01 x yields directly a k3t 7-manifold
with boundary t2x. if a2  1 (mod 2), then case (b-2) happens and the deform-and-ll
applied to (s3  k) 01 x yields a k3t 7-space with a1-singularities. after blowups,
this yields also a k3t 7-manifold with boundary t2  x. similarly for the latter case.



example 2.3.3 [k3t hierarchy]. let k be the gure-8 knot in example 2.3.1 and l
be the whitehead link in example 2.3.2. with the same notations as in the corresponding
examples, (s3  k)(a,b) is homeomorphic to (s3  l)(a,b;1,1) ([ro]), cf. figure 2-3-3.
consequently, (s3 k)1 x is bundle-isomorphic to the bundle-lling of (s3 l)10 x

14

with the dehn surgery coecient (a, b;). any k3t 7-manifold constructed from (s3 
k) 1 x by deform-and-ll can also be constructed from (s3  l) 10 x by deform-
and-ll. thus the k3t 7-manifold (s3  k) 1 x and its associated k3t family are all
descendants of (s3  l) 10 x.

example 2.3.4 [general k3t in our class]. let l = k1    ki    kk
be a link in s3 such that s3  l is hyperbolic. examples of such links from [th1] are
illustrated in figure 2-3-4. let (mi, li) be the meridian and the longitute pair of ki and
c = [ cij ]ij = [ lk (ki, kj) ]ij be the linking matrix of l (with respect to some orientation
of l and s3, which does not enter the discussion after mod 2). then the manifold
(s3  l)(a1,b1; ;ai,bi; ;ak,bk) is hyperbolic if all a2

i are large.

1,  k(1(tj)) is trivial for j  {i1,  ih} is that vi1, , ih  c(2) vi1,, ih 6= (0,  , 0).
for such 1  k, one can choose (ai, bi) to be  for i  {i1,  ih} and some integer pair

3 the deformation space of k3t 7-manifolds.

having in mind the potential application of k3t 7-manifolds to the compactication of m-
theory, which involves 11-dimensional space-time, we study in this section the deformation
space of the k3t 7-manifolds constructed in sec. 2. if the application of k3t to m-theory
can be carried out solidly, the deformation space of k3t should be related to the scalar
elds or their moduli space in the associated eective 4-dimensional theory.

16

3.1 the deformation space of k3t 7-manifolds constructed.

recall the k3t 7-manifold

: m 7  m 3 .

e

horizontal foliation by the at connection provides a transverse hyperbolic structure with

by construction, e admits a at connection over the complement of its set of critical values.
the complex structure of x determines a complex structure on a generic ber of e. the
respect to e, determined by the hyperbolic structure of n 3  m 3. deformations of
of the ber complex structures and the tranverse hyperbolic structures of e. since these

two deformations are independent from each other, the deformation space of the k3t
7-manifolds constructed in sec. 2 exhibits thus a decomposition

the complex structures on x and the hyperbolic structures on n 3 induce deformations

def ( k3t ) = def (x, )  def (n 3)  h 1(n 3, z2) ,

where the last component h 1(n 3, z2) corresponds to the twistings by x.

it is known that def (x, ) admits a kahler structure. and, as a corollary of works
by many people, def (n 3) admits a special kahler structure.
in view of the goal that
motivates us the current work - compactication of m-theory on a k3t 7-manifold -, the
appearance of these structures is a very welcome feature.

let us now discuss these structures in more detail.

3.2 the k3 part of deformations of k3t.

the deformation space for k3 surfaces has been studied intensively by several authors. in
this section, we summarize the results that are related to the current work. readers are
referred to [as], [bo], [b-p-vv], [dol], [g-w], [ni4], [ti], and [vo] for more details.

let l be the lattice (e8)  (e8)  h  h  h of signature (3, 19) and x be a
k3 surface. then the k3 lattice h 2(x; z) with the cup product is isomorphic to l. the
choice of an isometry  : h 2(x; z)  l determines a point in p (lc), corresponding to
the complex line c(h 2,0(x; c)). this point is called the period point of the marked k3
surface (x, ) and the set of all period points for a class of marked k3 surfaces is called
the period domain of that class. it gives the deformation space of the complex structures
of the k3 surfaces in that class.

assume from now on that x admits an antisymplectic involution , then  induces an
isometry  on h 2(x; z). let m be the picard lattice h 1,1(x, r)  h 2(x; z) of x and
t = m  h 2(x; z) be the transcendental lattice. then m coincides with h 2(x; z)+,
the xed lattice of , and t coincides with h 2(x; z), the sublattice, on which  acts
by 1. fix an embedding i : m  l and identify i(m ) with m . let
dm = { c  p (t  c)|    = 0,    > 0}

and

m = { c  dm | there exists a nonzero   t such that    = 0} .

17

then ([vo]) the period domain for the marked k3 surfaces (x, ) with involution acting
on h 2(x; z) as i is given by dm  m . a point in m corresponds to a k3 surface
x with an involution  whose induced isometry  on h 2(x; z) = h 2(x; z) is dierent
from . presumably such x has a larger picard lattice than m .

let us now turn to the geometry of the deformation space. by the hodge index
theorem ([b-p-vv], [dol]), m has signature (1, t) for some t and, hence, t has signature
(2, r) = (2, 19  t). a c  dm can be identied with the oriented positive-denite
2-plane in tr spanned by (re , im ). this leads to the identication

dm = o(2, r)/so (2)  o(r) .

since o(2, r) has four components, dm has two isomorphic components.

the inner product q on t induces an o(2, r)-invariant kahler metric ds2 on dm as
follows. first q induces a symmetric 2-tensor, still denoted by q, on tc. this denes
a hermitian inner product of signature (2, r) on tc by setting hv, wi = q(v, w). let 0
be the associated kahler form. let (z1, z2, z3,  , zr+2) be the complex coordinates for
(tc,h , i) with respect to an orthonormal basis. let

and

k = log q(v, v) = log(z1z1 + z2z2  z3z3    zn+2zn+2)
 = 1 k = 1

q(v, v) 0  q(dv, v)  q(v, dv)

q(v, v)2

,

where v = (z1, , zr+2) and dv = (dz1, , dzr+2) in terms of the given coordinates. note
that  is a homogeneous 2-form on tc {0} and hence descends to a 2-form, also denoted
by , on p (tc).
it is invariant under the induced o(2, r)-action. since this action is
transitive on dm , by choosing a point in dm , one can determine the signature of the
induced hermitian metric on dm . for example, take p = [ 1 : i : 0 :  : 0 ]  dm ; then,
in terms of the local coordinates

dm around p is decribed by 1 + w2
t p dm is given by dw0 = 0. consequently,

( w0, w1,  , wr ) = ( z2
1  w2

0  w2

,    , zr+2

z1

) ,

n = 0, and the complex cotangent space

|tpdm =

rxi=1

dwi  dwi .

thus  induces a positive-denite hermitian metric ds2 on dm . this is the weil-
petersson metric on dm ([ti]). it has negative holomorphic sectional curvatures that are
bounded away from zero ([gr-s], [ti]).

the above discussion also shows that (dm , ds2) is complete as a riemannian manifold.
since m has complex codimension at least 1, we shall take dm as the deformation space
for our k3 surfaces.

18

3.3 the thurston part of deformations of k3t.

the deformation space def (m 3) of hyperbolic structures associated to a complete hyper-
bolic 3-manifold m 3 of nite volume was explored by thurston in [th1]. many details
of his method were later studied further in [n-z] and [yo1, yo2]. with the anticipation
of relating def (m 3) to some 4-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric nonlinear -model,
we shall rephrase their results in terms of the complex symplectic language. a corollary
from their work is that there is a natural special kahler structure in a neighborhood of
the complete m 3  def (m 3). the associated integrable system and seiberg-witten-like
1-form can also be constructed, following [fr1] and [d-m1]. we shall now explain this in
some details.

def (m 3) from the complex symplectic viewpoint.

(a) an isotropic embedding  of def (m 3) in (c2n, ).

recall from sec. 1 the upper half-plane h+ = {z  c| im (z) > 0} and the ideal tetra-
hedron (z) of modulus z  h+. let m 3 be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold of nite
volume and

m 3 = (z0

1)    (z0
n)

be an ideal triangulation of m 3. since the euler characteristic of m 3 is zero, the number
of edges in the triangulation is the same as the number n of the tetrahedra. deformations
of the ideal tetrahedra lead then to deformations of the hyperbolic structures on m 3.
requiring the geometric angle around each edge of the triangulation from the piecewise
hyperbolic geometry be exactly 2 leads to a system of rational constraint equations:

ny=1

(z)r

j (1  z )r

j =

ny=1

(z0

 )r

j (1  z0

 )r

j ( = e2i ) ,

j = 1 , . . . , n ,

where zi  h+ and the product in each equation is taken in the universal covering group
gc of c = (c  {0},). there are some additional constraint equations coming from
the meridian to simple closed geodesics, around which the ends of ideal tetrahedra wind.
these equations are of the same form as the constraint equations from edges. all together,
j runs from 1 to some n  n. the system of equations dene def (m 3) as an ane variety
in (h+)n  cn. this variety has a distinguished point [m 3
0 ] corresponding to the complete
m 3. it is known from [n-z] and [th1] that the complex dimension of def (m 3) around
[m 3

0 ] coincides with the number h of cusps of m 3.
let c2n = (c2n, ) be the complex vector space with complex coordinates (w1,  w2n)
i=1 dwi  dwn+i. consider the following holo-

and the complex symplectic form  = n
morphic inclusion map

where we require that im (log z)  (0, ) and im (log (1  z))  (, 0). then the image
im  of  is an embedded complex lagrangian submanifold in (c2n, 0). let r be the
matrix [ r , r ] = [ (rj) , (rj)]n2n regarded as a linear map r from c2n to cn
by
matrix multiplication, then

def (m 3) = im   1

r (0) .

we shall denote this embedding of def (m 3) in (c2n, ) by . note that  send [m 3

in this way, one realizes def (m 3) as an isotropic analytic variety in (c2n, ) and one
0 ]  def (m 3) that forms a complex h-dimensional
can choose a neighborhood u of [m 3
isotropic submanifold in (c2n, ). in the following discussion, we shall choose u topolog-
ically a complex ball.

(b) the tautological embedding  of u in h 1(m 3; c).

recall from [th1] (cf. sec. 1) that the hyperbolic structure on m 3 associated to (z1, , zn)
in def (m 3) induces a complex ane structure on m 3 and hence determines a holonomy
representation from h1(m 3; z) to the complex ane group a (1, c). the derivative of
the holonomy (i.e. ignoring the translation part of the honomomy) gives then a holonomy
map  from h1(m 3; z) to c. explicitly, given a class [] in h1(m 3; z) represented by
a simplicial edge-loop  with respect to the induced triangulation on m 3 from the ideal
triangulation of m 3,  can be expressed in terms of zs as ([n-z])

where c and c are some integers and the factors appearing in the above product are
from the moduli of the triangle vertices touching  from the right with respect to the
orientation of  and m 3 (figure 3-1). this gives an embedding of the neighborhood u
of [m 3
0 ] mapped to
the element (  1) in h 1(m 3; z). since log is a local embedding from (c, 1) to (c, 0),
one can lift the image of u in h 1(m 3; c) to h 1(m 3; c) = hom (h1(m 3; z), c) by
taking logarithm of the coecient group.

0 ] from part (a) into h 1(m 3; c) = hom (h1(m 3; z), c) with [m 3

we shall denote the latter embedding of u by . note that [m 3

0 ] is mapped to the

zero element of h 1(m 3; c).

(c)  is lagrangian.

first observe that, when tensored with c, the cup product on h 1(m 3; z) induces a com-
plex symplectic structure + on h 1(m 3; c) and the intersecting pairing on h1(m 3; z)
induces a complex symplectic structure  on h1(m 3; c). the symplectic dual between
h 1(m 3; c) and h1(m 3; c) coincides with the poincare dual between the two.

figure 3-1. the triangle vertices that contribute to the holonomy
of the induced complex ane structure along a loop  (indicated
by the thick line) on m 3 are indicated by  and the orientation
of the boundary t2 is indicated by (cid:9). (cf. fig. 3 in [n-z].)

now let []  h1(m 3; z). then [] gives rise to a linear map [] from c2n to c

dened by

[](w1,  , wn ; wn+1,  , w2n) = c1w1 +  cnwn + c1wn+1 +  cnw2n ,

where c, c are obtained as in part (b). the correspondence [] 7 [] gives a homo-
morphism from h1(m 3; z) to the dual space (c2n, ) of (c2n, ). this then induces a
homomorphism  : h1(m 3; c)  c2n. from theorem 2.2 in [n-z] and the discussion

therearound, one has

fact 3.3.1. ([n-z])  is injective and symplectic.

after taking the symplectic dual, one thus realizes h1(m 3; c) as a complex 2h-dimensional
symplectic subspace s in (c2n, ).
recall the matrix r from part (a). its row vectors span a complex subspace in c2n.
let r be its symplectic dual in c2n. then proposition 2.3 of [n-z] can be rephrased as
fact 3.3.2. ([n-z]) r is isotropic and is contained in the symplectic orthogonal comple-
ment s of s. furthermore, 1

r (0) = r  s.

one can now identify s with h 1(m 3; c) canonically since both are symplectic dual to
r (0) to s. then, by chasing the denitions

h1(m 3; c). let s be the projection from 1
of the maps involved, one has

lemma 3.3.3. s   = .
this shows that

corollary 3.3.4.  is a lagrangian embedding of u in (h 1(m 3; c), +).

the relation of all the maps and spaces involved are indicated in figure 3-2 to make

the above discussion more transparent.

tively and a, b be their symplectic dual in s  c2n. note that (b,a) forms a transverse
pair of framed lagrangian subspaces in s and one can identify s as t b = b  (a),
where t b is the holomorphic cotangent bundle of b and a is a with framing induced
from (1,  ,h).
remark 3.3.5. as maps on s, a corresponds the projection map prb from s onto b,
while b corresponds to the projection map pra from s onto a. this explains why
s = t b = b  (a).

since u is lagrangian in s = t b, the restriction to u of the complex canonical 1-form

form df = |u on b for some holomorphic function f on b. pulling back to u via prb, one

remark 3.3.7 [independence of choices of (i, i)]. in terms of the terminology in [fr1],
each (a,b)-pair provides a conjugate pair of special holomorphic coordinate systems
on u . under dierent choices of (i, i), the (u1,  , uh, v1,  , vh) transforms under
hsl(2, z)  sp (2h, z), where the i th sl(2, z) in the product acts only on (ui, vi). thus
the kahler structure u on u constructed above is independent of the choices of (i, i).
the twisted real part

(x1,  , xh, y1,  yh) = (re u1,  , re uh,re v1,  ,re vh)

of (u1,  , uh, v1,  , vh) provides a real darboux coordinate system for (u, u ). since
the transition functions among such real coordinate systems are also integral, this denes
a at torsion free symplectic connection  on u .
remark 3.3.8 [naturality of f]. ([n-z] and [yo1]) for u = (u1,  uh)  u representing a
hyperbolic 3-manifold m 3
u obtained by a dehn lling on some cusps of m 3, the value f(u)
is related to the volume vol (m 3

where i are the simple geodesic loops assiciated to the dehn-lling and length (i),
torsion (i) are the length and the torsion of i (cf. [me], [n-z], [th2], and [yo1]). this
indicates that f is a very natural holomorphic function on u .

now recall from [d-m2] and [fr1] that

denition 3.3.9 [algebraic integrable system]. an algebraic integrable system is
a holomorphic map  : y  m , where y is a complex symplectic manifold with a
holomorphic symplectic form , such that

23

(1) the ber ym = 1(m) for all m  m is a compact lagrangian submanifols,

hence an ane torus;

(2) there is a smooth family [] of cohomology classes [m]  h 1,1(ym) h 2(ym; z)

such that [m] is a positive polarization of ym.

following previous discussions and notations, the holomorphic 1-forms du1, , duh, dv1,
, dvh generate a lattice  of complex lagrangian sections in t u that are at with
respect to . let t u be the holomorphic cotangent bundle of u . from theorem 3.4 in
[fr1], y = t u/  u is an algebraic integrable system over u with  from the canonical
holomorphic 2-form on t u and  from the dual of u . since  is independent of the
choices of (i, i) that denes (ui, vi), y is canonically associated to u .

the seiberg-witten-like 1-form  on y .

recall (e.g. [don] and [d-m1]) that, for the integrable system associated to the seiberg-
witten theory of a gauge group or to a complete family of calabi-yau threefolds, there
is a natural 1-form  on the total space of the integrable system, whose periods along
the ber tori provide a conjugate pair of holomorphic coordinate systems for the special
kahler or the projective special kahler geometry on its base. something similar happens
also to the integrable system (y, , ) over u .

lemma 3.3.10 [seiberg-witten-like 1-form]. there exists a smooth 1-form  on y
such that, if (u1,  , uh) and (v1,  , vh) are a conjugate pair of holomorphic coordinate
systems on u as discussed earlier and c1, , ch, c1 ,  , ch are the 1-cycles on the ber
of y associated to du1, , duh, dv1, , dvh respectively, then  satises the following
properties:

(1) the restriction of  to the ber of y is closed and the period of  with respect to

(c1, , ch, c1 , , ch) is (u1, , uh, v1, , vh);

(2) d =  and hence rc

following smooth complex-valued function on t u

sections generated by du1, , duh, dv1, , dvh and ot be the berwise translation of
t u generated by t, then

ot df  df = t .

observe that the summand (p cidui +p ci dvi) of df is exactly the canonical holo-
morphic 1-form  on t u , which satises also ot    = t. consequently, the dierence
df   is invariant under ot and hence descends to a smooth complex-valued 1-form 
on y . that  satises both property (1) and property (2) above follows by construction.
this concludes the proof.

remark 3.3.11 [relation to some natural 1-forms supported on the cusps of m 3]. recall
from sec. 2.1 the notations and the fact that each deformed cusp c of m 3, if nite, is
geometrically the quotient fn/e(1(t2)). the group of the induced e(1(t2))-action on
h3 = c   is a subgroup of the group of mobius transformations
the ideal boundary 
that x 0 and . since d log z = dz
is invariant under the latter group, one may rst
z to fn via the projection (z, t) 7 z and the covering map, and then project the
lift dz
resulting 1-form on fn to a complex-valued smooth 1-form c on c. the discussion is
similar for c innite. the periods of these c along a canonical basis (1, 1;  ; h, h)
for h1(m 3; z) gives then a conjugate pair of holomorphic coordinates (u1, , uh) and
(v1, , vh) that appear in earlier discussions. this suggests another natural at bundle
t over u whose ber tu over u  u is the product of the toroidal components of m 3
with the complex ane structure determined by u. from the product structure, one can
lift c to tu and sum them together to form a 1-form along a ber of t . using the at
connection on t , one obtains then a smooth complex-valued 1-form  on t . by identifying
t with the quotient (u  h1(m 3; r))/h1(m 3, z) and h1(m 3; z) with , one has a
bundle isomorphism

the pullback 1-form  is then cohomologous to  constructed in lemma 3.3.10. in some
way, 1 resembles the abel-prym map in the usual seiberg-witten theory (cf. [don]).

4 remarks and examples on general k3t 7-manifolds.

in this section, we discuss two ways in which the construction in sec. 2.2 can be generalized.
this will provide us with many other classes of k3t 7-manifolds.

flat k3t 7-manifolds from general (x, aut (x)).

the construction in sec. 2.2 has an immediate generalization: one may replace the k3
surface with involution by a k3 surface x with nontrivial group of automorphisms aut (x).
here an automorphism means a dieomorphism that preserves the complex structure.

25

recall that every k3 surface is kahler. the strong torelli theorem ([b-p-vv] and
[l-p]) for k3 surfaces can be stated as: the group aut (x) of automorphisms of a k3
surface x coincides with the group of hodge isometries of h 2(x, z) that preserve the
kahler cone of x. when x is algebraic, let sx be the picard lattice of x and wx the
group on h 2(x; z) generated by the picard-lefschetz reections sd : x 7 x + (x, d)d
associated to elements d in sx with (d, d) = 2. let isom (sx) be the group of isometries
of sx. then the quotient of aut (x) by the nite normal subgroup that consists of
automorphisms whose induced map on sx are trivial contains a subgroup of nite index
that is isomorphic to a subgroup of nite index in the quotient group isom (sx)/wx
([ps-s]). these fundamental facts allow one to convert the study of aut (x) to the study
of lattices with a bilinear form and the fundamental polyhedron of the wx-action (cf.
[ni1-5]).

examples of k3 surfaces with an innite automorphism group are provided by excep-
tional k3 surfaces. these are algebraic k3 surfaces whose rank of sx equals the maximal
possible number 20. they are all realizable as an elliptic pencil with innitely many sec-
tions ([s-i]). once a section is xed as the identity section, the ber then has an abelian
group structure. the berwise translation by a section gives then an automorphism of x.
this special subgroup of aut (x) is called the mordell-weil group of x.

on the other hand, k3 surfaces with nite automorphism group have been studied
extensively by nikulin ([ni1-5]) and others. finite groups g that can act on a k3 surface
eectively and leave the holomorphic 2-form xed were completely worked out by mukai
([muk] and [ni2]). he also gave the k3 surfaces on which such g act, as in table 4-1.
in particular, exactly the following fteen groups can be realized as such automorphism
group for some k3 surface ([ni2] and its added-in-proof):

(z2)k , 0  k  4 ;
z3  z3 ; z4  z4 .

z3 ;

z4 ;

z5 ;

z6 ;

z7 ;

z8 ;

z2  z4 ;

z2  z6 ;

and the quotient orbifolds have a-singularities.

a program along this line, following the deform-and-ll procedure in sec. 2.2, involves

the study of the following pieces:

1. k3 surface x with nontrivial aut (x), how aut (x) acts on x, and the deformation

space of k3 surfaces that share isomorphic aut (x). (cf. figure 4-1.)

2. representations x of 1(m 3) into aut (x). (a computer code may be helpful here.

cf. e.g. [fo], [ga], [joh], [l-r], and [ri1].)

3. singularities on w 7 obtained from n 3 x x by the deform-and-ll procedure and

their resolutions.

4. structures on the deformation space of the resulting k3t 7-manifolds

def ( k3t ) = def (x, aut (x))  def (n 3)  hom (1(n 3), aut (x))

(cf. sec. 3.1).

to illuminate the idea.

and the cubic x3

from the action of sym 5 on cp4 by permutations of the homogeneous coordinates. let

(its complement admits

consider the representation  from 1(s3  k) to sym 5 generated by

a 7 (12345) ,

b 7 (13542)

([fo], also [ri1]; up to conjugation, this is the unique nonabelian representation from
1(s3  k) to sym 5 that sends the generators a and b to 5-cycles). thus 1(s3  k) acts
on x through . now let w 7 be the quotient ^s3  (k)x/1(s3  k), where ^s3  (k)
is the universal covering of s3(k) and the group action is diagonal. since the (1, 1)-loop
along k is sent by  to the identity in sym 5, the boundary of this 7-manifold is dieo-
morphic to x(a)  s1, where x(a) is the mapping torus x  [0, 1]/x  {0}
 x  {1}.
to see how this boundary can be lled as in sec. 2.2, notice that (a) acts on x with

(a)

four xed points of order 5:

[1 :  :  2 :  3 :  4] ,

[1 :  2 :  4 :  :  3] ,

[1 :  3 :  :  4 :  2] ,

[1 :  4 :  3 :  2 : ] ,

where  is a fth root of 1 and the quotient has 4 a4-singularities. consequently, the
action of the cyclic group z5 = h f i on d2  x generated by
f : (z, x) 7 (z , (a)(x))

has xed points only on {o}  x, which are exactly the xed points of (a) on x. by
construction, the quotient complex singular threefold has boundary x(a). to resolve the
singularity, observe that the induced linear map of f on t p(d2  x), where p is a xed
point, can be put into the diagonal form diag{; , 1} if one chooses the holomorphic

28

coordinates of x around p appropriately. hence, if one blows up d2  x at these xed
points and denotes the new complex threefold by z, then h f i acts on z freely. the
quotient z = z/h f i is smooth and bred over d2/h f i, which can be smoothened to
a smooth 2-disk again, with central ber {x  4 (cp2 cp1 cp2)}/h f i. consequently,
z  s1 lls w 7. let m 3 be the 3-manifold (s3  k)(1,1). after lled and smoothened,
the resulting m 7 is k3-bred over m 3 with exceptional ber {x  4 (cp2 cp1 cp2)}/h f i

over the core curve of the lling solid torus.



remark 4.2. any k3t (or just k3-bred) 7-manifold thus constructed admits a natural
at connection over the complement of the set of critical values of the k3-bration. also
its generic k3 bers are all biholomorphic. thus, in some sense, it is in the category of
at analytic-k3t 7-manifolds, whose precise denition will be left to the future after we
gain better feeling about k3t.

from analytic-k3t to smooth-k3t.

in contrast with the at analytic-k3t 7-manifolds so far discussed, let us give the reader
some idea about general smooth-k3t 7-manifolds before ending.

though no precise denition for a smooth-k3t 7-manifold is attempted in this paper,

it is helpful to recall the following denition in a well-understood case from [f-m2]:

denition 4.3 [smooth-elliptic bration]. a c-elliptic surface is a smooth map
 : s  c from a closed, smooth, oriented 4-manifold s to a smooth oriented 2-manifold
c such that for each point p  c there is an open disk   c of p, a complex elliptic
surface z   and a smooth orientation-preserving dieomorphism 1()  z such
that the following diagram commutes:

1()
 


= z


=  .

in other words, s is the total space of pastings of local elliptic brations z   with
smooth transition functions. in the following, we shall use the word smooth to mean
c r for some r.

for our situation, the base manifold of the k3-bration has real dimension 3; and there
is no theory of a real family of complex manifolds developed yet. so it is not clear what
wild things may arise if one follows the above denition to dene smooth-k3t 7-manifolds.
however, there are situations for which one can still have control of the degenerate ber:
e.g. one may requires that locally the bration is dieomorphic to a k3-bration of the
form  : z    [0, 1] with  restricted to each   {t} the ususal k3-bration from
a complex 1-parameter family of k3 surfaces, or of the form  : z  3 that comes

29

from the restriction to a real 3-disk of a k3-bration associated to a complex 2-parameter
family of k3 surfaces.

conned to such, there are two kinds of complex 1-parameter degenerate k3 surfaces

that have played roles in the string literature (e.g. [as] and [a-m2]):

 orbifold degenerations (a-d-e singularities): ([b-p-vv] and [di]) when a k3 sur-
face admits disjoint a-d-e chains of (2) curves, one may contract them through
a complex 1-parameter family via deformation of complex structures. the result is
then a degenerate k3 surface with a-d-e singularities. a huge class of such examples
are provided by elliptic k3 surfaces with a section. the kodairas table of singular
elliptic bers that can appear in an elliptic bration of a complex surface contains
various extended a-d-e dynkin diagrams. for a k3 surface with a section, one can
then contract the irreducible components of the singular bers that are disjoint from
the section and obtains a k3 surface with a-d-e singularities. from the work of
miranda and persson ([m-p]), one knows that, while the total number of singular
bers of an elliptic k3 surface cannot exceed the euler number 24 of a k3 surface,
there are more than a thousand of combinations of them that can truely happen.
via contraction, this provides then a big collection of degenerate k3 surfaces with
various combinations a-d-e singularities. the nature of a-d-e singularities makes
the resulting complex surface a complex orbifold.

 semistable degenerations (kulikov degenerations of type ii and iii ): ([f-s] and [ku].)
this is given by a family  : x  d2 of k3 surfaces over the unit disk d2 = {t 
c||t|  1} such that x is smooth with trivial canonical bundle, all bers xt = 1(t)
are smooth k3 for t  d2  {0}, and the central ber x0 is a reduced divisor in x
with normal crossing singularities. there are only three situations:

x0 is a smooth k3 surface.

(i)
(ii) x0 is a chain of elliptic ruled surfaces v1 +  + vn whose associated

simplicial complex of intersections is given by


v1


v2

  





vn1 vn

with rational surfaces on either end; the double curves vi  vi+1 that
appear in the intersections are all elliptic curves.

(iii) x0 is a union of rational surfaces; the double curves on each irreducible
component of x0 form a cycle of rational curves; and the associated
simplicial complex of intersections is a triangulation of s2.

(note that the simplicial complex of intersections associated to a decomposition
x0 = i vi by irreducible components is dened by assigning to each vi a vertex,
to each non-empty vi  vj an edge eij connectiog vi and vj, to each non-empty
vi  vj  vk a face with boundary eij  ejk  eki, etc.)

from mumfords semistable reduction theorem ([k-k-m-sd]), an orbifold - indeed
any - degeneration  : x  d2 of algebraic k3 surfaces can always be converted into a
semistable degeneration  : x  d2 after blowups at the degenerate ber x0 = 1(0),
a base change d2  d2 with t 7 t = tk for some positive integer k, and then blowups
again at the new central degenerate ber of x d2 d2 over d2. when this happens,
the monodromy dieomorphism  of k3 associated to  is the power  k, where  is the
monodromy dieomorphism of k3 associated to .

combined with the construction in sec. 2.2, this immediately provides us with another

big class of k3t 7-manifolds.

example 4.4 [smooth-k3t]. let ei, i = 1, , n, be a disjoint collection of a-d-e
chains of embedded 2-spheres of self-intersection 2 in a k3 surface x and i be the
associated monodromy dieomorphism supported in a small neighborhood of ei. one can
choose these neighborhoods to be disjoint from each other so that i commute with each
other. consequently, they generate an abelian subgroup h 1,  , n i in di (k3).
let l = k1    ki    kk be a hyperbolic link in s3. as in example 2.3.4,
let (mi, li) be the meridian and the longitute pair of ki, c = [ cij ]ij = [ lk (ki, kj) ]ij be
the linking matrix of l with respect to some orientation of l and s3, and the manifold
from surgery (s3  l)(a1,b1;  ;ai,bi; ;ak,bk) be hyperbolic. since h 1,  , n i is abelian, a
representation from 1(s3 l) to h 1,  , n i is determined by a representation x from
h1(s3  l; z), which is a free abelian group generated by {m1,  , mk}, to h 1,  , n i.
let

for such boundary component of s3  (l), let us investigate how the k3-bundle

 : (s3  (l)) x x  s3  (l) .

can be lled.

consider the solid torus v =  s1, where  is a compact disk in c. let m and l be a
meridian and a longitude of v respectively. a representation  from 1(v ) = h1(v ; z)
to h 1,  , n i with

( m) = f m =  k1

and

(l) = fl =

denes a at k3-bundle:

pr1 : v  x = (r2  x)/(1(v ), (1(v )))  v ,

31

where the group action on r2  x is diagonal. let pr2 : z   be a c-k3 bration
(cf. denition 4.3) with degenerate bers xij over sij in the interior of  the singular
k3 surface with ei  x pinched to a point, where i  {i|ki
6= 0} and j = 1, . . . ,|ki|,
such that the monodromy of the bration along  (with induced orientation from that
of ) is precisely f m. such bration can be easily constructed by a ber sum of the
corresponding complex 1-parameter family degenerations ij : zij  (, 0) that give each
individual isolated a-d-e singularity, as indicated in figure 4-3. since i can act on

figure 4-3. a ber sum of basic k3-brations associated to
complex 1-parameter family degenerations ij : zij  (, 0), re-
alized as the ber sum of each bration to the trivial bration
  x  . the degenerate ber of ij is shown and the occur-
rence of ber sum is indicated by grey shade.

zij as a bration c 1-automorphism and z is constructed by ber sum, i acts also on
z. together with the fact that 1,  , n commute, this implies that fl can act on z
as a bration c 1-automorphism that projects to the identity map on  under pr2 and
commutes with f m.

by taking the mapping torus zfl

of z with respect to fl, one then obtains a k3-bration

pr : zfl  v ,

whose restriction to t2 = v is equivalent to pr1 and hence can be used to bundle-ll pr1.
applying such bundle-lling to  for each boundary t2 of s3  (l) with (ai.bi) 6= , one
obtains thus a smooth-k3t 7-manifold



: m 7  (s3  l)(a1,b1;  ;ai,bi; ;ak,bk) .

this concludes the example.



32

remark 4.5 [at smooth-k3t]. similar to the analytic category, one can also consider
(x, di (k3)) for a k3 surface x and apply the construction in sec. 2.2 to obtain at
smooth-k3t 7-manifolds. a general theory of such involves in particular two issues:

(1) the structure of di (k3) and/or the mapping class group mcg (k3) of a k3

surface and

(2) representations of a 3-manifold group 1(n 3) into di (k3) or mcg (k3),

which by themselves are already very challenging. as is well-known, the mapping class
group of a compact riemann surface is nitely generated by the dehn twists along a
system of simple loops (e.g. [bi] and [h-t]); it is interesting to know if something similar
may happen for k3 surfaces.

remark 4.6 however, in the smooth category, it is not clear to us what kind of nite
dimensional deformation space can be associated to a k3t 7-manifold.

issues on applications to m-theory compactication.

k3t 7-manifolds are constructed as natural interpolating 7-manifolds among some k3-
bred calabi-yau threefolds. this is meant to reects the physical fact that m-theory
interpolates various string theories. in this section, we list some issues for further study
in order to understand the role of k3t 7-manifolds in m-theory.

 k3t and supergravity. m-theory has 11-dimensional supergravity as its low-enery
limit ([h-w1]). the eld contents of the latter [c-j-s] consist of the 11-bein ea
 (graviton),
a majorana spin- 3
2 eld  (gravitino), and a 3-form a as gauge tensor. in a local chart,
the bosonic part of the eld equations in the theory reads (cf. [fre], summation convention
for repeating indices assumed)

where gmn = ep
npq with pq = diag (1, 1,  , 1) the standard metric on the 11-
dimensional minkowskian space-time r1+10, rmn and r are the ricci and scaler curvature
of g,  the covariant derivative associated to g, h = da, and  = m1  m11 is the
standard volume-form on r1+10. the imposition of various ansatz and the requirement
of the residual supersymmetry when compactied to 4 dimensions lead to constraints on
the underlying geometry, for example, existence of killing spinors (e.g. [fre]) and many
exact solutions (e.g. [c-r-w], [d-n-p1], and [vn-w]) to the above equations. though
related to calabi-yau threefolds by taking boundary and to k3-bred joyce manifolds as
a generalization via 3-dimensional geometry, unlike either kind of manifolds, general k3t
7-manifolds do not seem to satisfy these known constraints, nor is it clear where there

33

exists a k3t 7-manifold that supports a solution to the general eld equations above.
perhaps one has to look for other possible interfaces between k3t and m.

 deformation space of k3t vs. deformation space of calabi-yau. one such
candidate interface is via deformation space. this is rooted at the fundamental theorem
on hyperbolic 3-manifolds ([ber1, ber2], [mcm], and [su]), which states roughly that, given
a hyperbolic 3-manifold m 3, the teichmuller space of complete hyperbolic structures on
m 3 is isomorphic to the teichmuller space of complex structures on its ideal boundary
m 3 by sending a hyperbolic structure on m 3 to the conformal structure it induces
on m 3. we already saw this kind of boundary-dictate-interior behavior in sec. 3,
where hyperbolic structures on n 3 is controlled by the complex ane structures on its
toroidal n 3. for analytic k3t 7-manifolds with calabi-yau boundary, this suggests a
close relation between def (k3t) and def (calabi-yau), perhaps via bration, embedding,
or limit (cf. [b-d-f-p-t-p-z] and [le]).

for the class of k3t 7-manifolds constructed in sec. 2, let (u1,  , uh) and (v1, , vh)
be the conjugate coordinates systems for u  def (m 3) in sec. 3, then an immediate map
relating def (k3t) and def (calabi-yau) is given by

def ( k3t )

(w ; u1,  , uh)


7 (cid:16) ( v1

u1

def c( (k3t) )
, w) ,  , ( vh

uh

, w)(cid:17) ,

 def (h

i=1

t2  x )

where w is the complex structure of x and def c((k3t)) is the deformation space of
the complex structures on the boundary i t2  x. details of this map and what kahler
deformations of the calabi-yau boundary are translated to on the k3t side remain to be
explored.

 k3t, dilogarithm, and cft. the appearance of hyperbolic 3-manifolds of nite
volume as a key ingredient in k3t 7-manifolds has a mysterious feature. we already
saw in sec. 3 that the deformation space of a such 3-manifold m 3 has a special kahler
structure with a prepotential f related to the volume function vol (cf. remark 3.3.8). it
turns out that vol is related to the dilogarithm function ([n-z] and [za]) dened by the
analytic continuation of the following power series

li 2(z) =

xn=1

z2
n2

on

{ z |kzk < 1}  c .

some role of this function in conformal eld theory (cft) was explored in [na] and
[n-r-t]. can one deepen their work and, from which, nd yet another way k3t and
string/m-theory may be related?

we conclude this paper with these unresolved issues for future pursuit.
