abstract

correlators of wilson loop operators with tr(f 2

 + . . .) are computed in n = 4
super-yang-mills theory using the ads/cft correspondence. the result are compared
with the leading order perturbative computations. it is found that, for circular wilson
loops, these correlators have identical functional forms in the weak and strong coupling
limits, with coecients which are dierent functions of the t hooft coupling g2n . this
non-renormalization behavior is attributed to a residual supersymmetry of the circular
wilson loop.

the conjectured duality of n = 4, d = 4 super-yang-mills theory (sym) to supergrav-
ity on ads5  s5 gives rise to the possibility of obtaining quantitative information about the
former theory in the limit of innite t hooft coupling [1, 2, 3, 4]. this is a regime which is
inaccessible to conventional perturbative eld theory methods. tests of this conjecture rely
on weak coupling calculations together with non-renormalization arguments which follow
from the large amount of supersymmetry in n = 4 sym; these arguments allow the extrap-
olation of some weak coupling results to strong coupling [5, 6, 7]. the agreement between
supergravity calculations and various non-renormalization theorems has provided nontrivial
checks of the ads/cft correspondence [4].

surprisingly, the supergravity calculations reveal agreement between the strong and weak
coupling limits of a wider class of correlation functions than would be expected from known
non-renormalization theorems [8]. the conjecture that some of these correlators are not
renormalized at all has subsequently been conrmed by explicit next-to-leading order pertur-
bative calculations [9, 10]. the non-renormalization theorems for n = 4 sym are discussed
in [8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
the purpose of the present paper is to examine the possible non-renormalization prop-
erties of correlators involving wilson loops. we shall compare the result of supergravity
calculations with the leading order of perturbation theory for the correlator of a wilson loop
with the operator tr(f 2
 + . . .) for two dierent kinds of wilson loops. we shall nd that if
the wilson loop consists of two innite anti-parallel lines, the functional form of the correla-
tors dier in the weak and strong coupling limits. on the other hand, for a circular loop we
shall see that the functional form of the correlator is identical in weak and strong coupling,
but the coecients dier. at weak coupling it is proportional to g2n, whereas at strong
coupling it is proportional to g2n . we attribute the coincidence of the functional forms
of the correlators to a residual supersymmetry of the circular wilson loop. a small circular
wilson loop can be expanded in local operators. our result then implies that the anomalous
dimensions encoded in their correlators with tr(f 2
 + . . .) are protected by supersymmetry.
however, the coecients of the correlators do seem to depend on the coupling constants in
a non-trivial way.

the wilson loop appropriate for supergravity calculations corresponds to the phase factor
aquired by an innitely heavy w-boson propagating in background gauge and scalar elds
[16, 17]:

w (c) =

1
n

tr p expic

d (ia x + i yi),

(1)

where a are u(n) gauge elds and i are six scalars elds in the adjoint representation,
yi =  x2i, and i is a point on the ve-dimensional sphere: 2 = 1. the form of the coupling
to scalars in (1) is natural from several points of view [17, 18]. in particular, this wilson loop
operator is annihilated by half of the supercharges if c is a straight line [17]. on the other
hand, closed wilson loops are generally not supersymmetric. a circular loop, however, is a
special case since it can be mapped to a straight line by a conformal transformation. the
straight line wilson loop operator commutes with half of the supersymmetry generators.
thus, circular loops are annihilated by a combination of supercharges twisted by conformal

transformations:

q = (c)q(c),

(2)

where (c) is an unitary operator implementing a conformal transformation that maps c
to a line. since conformal invariance is an exact symmetry of the n = 4 sym vacuum,
|0i = |0i and the twisted supercharges annihilate the vacuum: q|0i = 0, along with
the original supersymmetry generators q.
if the wilson loop has a dierent geometry,
generically there is no residual supersymmetry. this is the case when it has two innite
anti-parallel lines. our computation in the following illustrates a striking dierence between
these two cases.

the distinguished role of the circular loops can also be seen from the perspective of
supergravity. the classical string world sheet ending on a circular loop in ads5  s5 has
a very simple functional form [17, 20] in comparison to solutions for other wilson loops
[16, 19, 21, 17]; this is a consequence of the conformal equivalence of a circle to a line [20].

we consider the correlator

w(c, x) =  dw (c)

2g2 tr(cid:16)f 2
hw (c)i

(x) + . . .(cid:17)econn

,

(3)

where by dots we denote the scalar and the fermionic terms required to constitute the di-
mension four operator in the short multiplet of n = 4 susy. the correlator (3) determines
the uctuations of the electric eld induced by non-dynamical charges whose trajectories
form the loop c. this correlator has been discussed in the context of the ads/cft corre-
spondence in refs. [20, 22, 23]. it was calculated in the nite-temperature, conning phase
of the strongly coupled n = 4 sym [22] where the wilson loop has two innite antiparallel
lines. there, it was used to demonstrate the fact that the classical string in ads space is
projected onto an electric ux tube which is stretched between static charges and the thick-
ness of which is of order the correlation length [22]. in the conformal theory, the correlator
must fall-o as a power of the distance from the loop. however, we shall show that, in this
case, the fall-o of the correlator (3) at strong coupling is dierent from the 1/d6 behavior
of the dipole electric eld squared.

at strong coupling, correlators in the sym theory are described by classical supergravity
on ads5  s5. we choose units in which the radius of ads5 is unity. the metric on
ads5  s5 in these units is

the wilson loop on the boundary of ads5 at z = 0 creates the classical string world sheet
in the bulk; it is the surface of minimal area bounded by the loop [16, 19]. the operator
in discussion of the supersymmetry, it is convenient to consider n = 4 sym theory as a reduction of
ten-dimensional n = 1 theory. then the supercharges are the components of a ten-dimensional majorana-
weyl spinor q. the gauge potentials and the scalar elds form a ten-dimensional vector: am = (a, i).
the supercharges act on gauge potentials as [q, am ] = i
2 (m ), where m are dirac matrices and  is
the ten-dimensional majorana-weyl fermion, the reduction of which to four dimensions gives the fermionic
content of n = 4 sym theory. the supersymmetry transformation of a wilson loop produces degenerate
combination of the dirac matrices [17]:  x m m , x m = (x, iyi), since x 2 = 0. an appropriate choice of
 turns the variation of a wilson loop to zero if

x m is constant, that is, if c is a straight line.

tr(f 2
 + . . .) couples to the dilaton. so, the correlation function (3) is given by the dilaton
propogator with one end attached to the point x and the other integrated over the minimal
surface spanning the loop c [20]:

is the metric induced on the minimal surface. the surface is parametrized by coordinates

y m = (cid:16)z(), x ()(cid:17).

at weak coupling, the correlator (3) is given by the lowest-order feynman diagram:

for supersymmetry preserving circular loop we nd:

where r is the radius of the loop, r is the radial coordinate of the point ~x, and y is the
distance from ~x to the plane of the loop. this expression coincides with the result of the
strong-coupling supergravity calculation given in [20]:

wg  qg2n

r4

[(y2 + r2  r2)2 + 4r2y2]2 .

the functional form of the correlator of tr(f 2 + . . .) with the circular loop appears not to
be renormalized.

for comparison, we calculate the same correlator for a loop composed of antiparallel

innite lines. the leading-order perturbative result is

wg0 =

where l is the distance between the lines; d is the distance, in the plane of the lines, between
the point ~x and the line midway between the two lines, and y is the distance between ~x and
the plane of the lines.

an expression for the minimal surface whose boundary is the two lines is given in [16]:

where y, l, and d are as before.

this result is clearly dierent than that of the perturbative calculation. in particular,
we can consider their asymptotic behaviour when the distance to the point ~x is much larger
than the separation between the charges l. expanding (11) in l gives

g2n l3
(y2 + d2)7/2 + o(l5).

wg 

(12)

the perturbative correlator (8) is just the eld strength of electric dipole squared and is
proportional to l2 for small l:

wg0 =

g2n
642

(4d2 + y2)l2
(y2 + d2)4 + o(l4).

(13)

thus, the two correlators obey dierent power laws at large d, with wg falling o as d7
and wg0 falling o as d6. figure 1 shows the dependence of the correlator (3) at strong
and at weak coupling as a function of y at d = 0.
however, the leading singularity as the point x approaches the loop obeys the same power
law in the weak and the strong coupling limits. in both cases, the correlator behaves as 4,
where  = d  l/2 is the distance from the loop, as can be checked from eqs. (8) and (11).

the power law in the leading singularity is not renormalized, because locally any wilson
loop preserves one half of the supersymmetry. the curvature of the loop is inessential to the
leading order in  and the loop can be approximated by a straight line.

to conclude, we have calculated correlators of wilson loops with the dimension four pri-
mary operator tr(f 2 + . . .) in n = 4 sym. we have compared the perturbative expression
with the result predicted by the ads/cft correspondence at strong coupling. the corre-
lator for a circular loop, which preserves one half of the supersymmetry after a conformal
transformation, has the same functional form in both regimes, whereas the answer is com-
pletely dierent for non-supersymetric wilson loops. motivated by this result, we conjecture
that the functional form of correlators of circular wilson loops with chiral primary operators
is completely independent of the coupling.
