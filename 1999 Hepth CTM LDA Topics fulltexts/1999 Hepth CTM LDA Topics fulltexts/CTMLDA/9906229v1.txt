abstract

the concept of determinant for a linear operator in an innite-dimensional space is

addressed, by using the derivative of the operators zeta-function (following ray and singer)

and, eventually, through its zeta-function trace. a little play with operators as simple as
i (i being the identity operator) and variations thereof, shows that the presence of a non-
commutative anomaly (i.e., the fact that det (ab) 6= det a det b), is unavoidable, even for
commuting and, remarkably, also for almost constant operators. in the case of dirac-type

operators, similarly basic arguments lead to the conclusion contradicting common lore
that in spite of being det(/d + im) = det(/d  im) (as follows from the symmetry condition of
the /d-spectrum), it turns out that these determinants may not be equal to qdet(/d2 + m2),
simply because det[(/d+im)(/dim)] 6= det(/d+im) det(/dim). a proof of this fact is given,
by way of a very simple example, using operators with an harmonic-oscillator spectrum and

fullling the symmetry condition. this anomaly can be physically relevant if, in addition

to a mass term (or instead of it), a chemical potential contribution is added to the dirac

operator.

1. introduction

many fundamental calculations of quantum field theory reduce, in essence, to the

computation of the determinant of some operator. one could even venture to say that, at

one-loop order, any such theory reduces to a theory of determinants. the operators involved

are dierential ones, as the normal physicist would say. in fact, properly speaking, they

are pseudodierential operators (do), that is, in loose terms some analytic functions of
dierential operators (such as 1 + d or log(1 + d), but not! log d). this is explained in
detail in refs. [1][3].

important as the concept of determinant of a dierential or do may be for theoretical

physicists (in view of what has just been said), it is surprising that this seems not to be

a subject of study among function analysts or mathematicians in general. this statement

must be qualied: i am specically refering to determinants that involve in its denition

some kind of regularization, very much related to operators that are not traceclass. this

piece of calculus always involving regularization falls outside the scope of the standard

disciplines and even many physically oriented mathematicians know little or nothing about it.

in a sense, the subject has many things in common with that of divergent series but has not

been so groundly investigated and lacks any reference comparable to the very beautiful book

of hardy [4]. actually, from this general viewpoint, the question of regularizing innite

determinants was already addressed by weierstrass in a way that, although it has been

pursued by some theoretical physicists with success, is not without problems as a general

method since it ordinarily leads to non-local contributions that cannot be given a physical

meaning in qft. we should mention, for completion, that there are, since long ago, well

stablished theories of determinants for degenerate operators, for traceclass operators in the

hilbert space, fredholm operators, etc.

[5] but, again, these denitions of determinant do

not fulll all the needs mentioned above which arise in qft.

any high school student knows what a determinant is, in simple words, or at least how
to calculate the determinant of a 3 3 matrix (and some of them, even that of a 4 4 one).
but many one prominent mathematician will answer the question: what is your favourite

denition of determinant of a dierential operator? with: i dont have any, or: these

operators dont have determinants! an even more simple question i dare to ask the reader

(which she/he may choose to ask to some other colleague on its turn) is the following: what

is the value of the determinant of minus the identity operator in an innite dimensional

space? followed by: and that of the determinant qnn (1)n? is it actually equal to the

2

product of the separate determinants of the plus 1s and of the minus 1s?

in this contribution i will point out to specic situations, some of them having become

common lore already and other that have appeared recently in the literature, concerning the

concept of determinant in qft, and i will try to give reasonable answers to questions such

as the last ones.

2. innite series and (almost) trivial determinants

the mathematical theory of divergent series has been very fruitful in taming the innites

that have appeared in qft, from the very begining of its conception.

its role is very

essential, at least in the rst stage of the regularization/renormalization procedure. euler

and borel summation methods, and analytic continuation techniques are there commonly

used. but some diculties exist that are inherent to the theory of divergent series (see,

for instance, [4]). one of them is the well known fact that, sometimes, by using dierent

schemes, dierent results are obtained. in a well posed physical situation, the right one

can then only be choosen after experimental validation. another problem is to understand,

in physical terms, what you are doing, while performing say an analytic continuation from

one region of the complex plane to another [6]. this has prevented e.g.the zeta function

regularization procedure from getting general aceptance among common physicists.

the situation concerning innite determinants is even worse, in a sense. there is no book

on the subject to be compared, for instance, with the above mentioned one by hardy and we

see every day that dubious manipulations are being performed at the level of the eigenvalues,

that are then translated to the determinant itself and elevated sometimes to the cathegory

of standard results when not of lore theorems. the rst problem is the denition of the

determinant itself. let me quote in this respect from a recent paper by e. witten [7]: the

determinant of the dirac operator is dened roughly as

det d = yi

i,

(1)

where the innite product is regularized with (for example) zeta function or pauli-villars

regularization. the zeta function denition of the determinant

detd = exp [d

(0)] ,

(2)

is maybe the one that has more rm mathematical grounds [8]. in spite of starting from

the identity:

log det = tr log, it is known to develop the so called multiplicative anomaly:

3

the determinant of the product of two operators is not equal, in general, to the product of

the determinants (even if the operators commute!). this happens already with very simple

operators (as two one-dimensional harmonic oscillators only diering in a constant term,

laplacians plus dierent mass terms, etc.). it may look incredible, at rst sight, from the

tr log property and the additivity of the trace, but we must just take into account that the

zeta trace is no ordinary trace (for it involves regularization), namely:

trd = d(1),

(3)

so that tr(a + b) 6= tra + trb, in general. not to understand this has originated a con-
siderable amount of errors in the specialized literature falsely attributed to missfunctions

of the rigorous and elegant zeta function method!

as an example, consider the following commuting linear operators in an innite-dimensional

space, given in diagonal form by:

o1 = diag (1, 2, 3, 4, . . .),

o2 = diag (1, 1, 1, 1, . . .)  i,

and their sum

o1 + o2 = diag (2, 3, 4, 5, . . .).

the corresponding -traces are easily obtained:

1
12

tro2 = r(0) = 

1
2

,

tro1 = r(1) = 
tr(o1 + o2) = r(1)  1 = 

,

13
12

,

(4)

(5)

(6)

the last trace having been calculated according to the rules of innite series summation (see

e.g., hardy [4]). we observe that

tr(o1 + o2)  tro1  tro2 = 

1
2 6= 0.

(7)

if this happens in such simple situation, involving the identity operator, one can easily

imagine that any precaution one can take in manipulating innite sums might turn out

to be insucient. moreover, since the multiplicative anomaly as has been pointed out

before originates precisely in the failure of this addition property for the regularized trace,

we can already guess that it also can show up in very simple situations, as will now be

proven, in fact. the appearance of the multiplicative anomaly prevents, in particular, naive

4

manipulations with the eigenvalues in the determinant, as reorderings and splittings, what

a number of physicists seem not to be aware of.

for warming up, let us calculate some simple determinants with the zeta function method.

to start with, take

1 =



yn=1

n.

1(s) =



xn=1

ns = r(s),

r

(0) = 

1
2

log(2),

we have

so that

1 = exp(cid:20) 1

2

log(2)(cid:21) = 2,

a nice result. in the same way, we obtain

2 =



yn=1

n1 =

1
2

from 2(s) = r(s) as should be expected.

let us now consider the apparently more simple case:

3 =



yn=1

.

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

this poses a problem to the zeta function method, which must be modied somehow to cope

with such situation. in fact, the corresponding zeta function,

3(s) =



xn=1

s,

(13)

has no abscissa of convergence in the complex plane (since the sequence of eigenvalues is

neither increasing nor decreasing. this can be, however, naturally solved as follows: by

taking logarithms (what is inherent with the denition of the zeta function method) and

using again the rules for innite series, it is plain that the result is

log 3 = log 



xn=1

1 = 

1
2

log ,

(14)

where the factor in front of log  may be interpreted as the zeta measure of the set of

positive natural numbers, thus

3 =



yn=1

 =  1
2 .

5

(15)

this leads, in particular, to the following results:

4 =



yn=1

1 = 1 1

2 = 1,

for the determinant of the identity operator, i, and



5 =

yn=1

(1) = (1) 1

2 = i,

(16)

(17)

for the determinant of the operator i. as it seems clear that the determinant of the
identity operator should be 1, this tells us (by choice everywhere of the same determination
of the logarithm in the complex plane) that the determinant of i is i and, that of i,
the inverse of the corresponding square root of  in (15). notice that, in this way, we

are starting to build up a set of consistency rules that are reminiscent, in some manner,

of the corresponding rules for innite series [4]. more than this, by use of the logarithm,

all the ordinary rules for innite series are appliable to the series of logs of eigenvalues, in

particular, the ones concerning multiplication by a common factor (used before already), or

of splitting out a nite number of rst terms from the series (that is to say, a nite number

of rst factors from the determinant). however, the splitting of an innite number of terms

or of the whole series into two is not allowed in general. that is, again, the lesson

we have learned from the existence of the multiplicative anomaly of the determinant when

evaluated by the zeta function procedure. an additional comment is in order:

in dealing

with innite series we always take logarithms, and this introduces an ambiguity in the zeta

function denition of the determinant. this fact is well known [9, 10] and is common to

other regularization methods (as pauli-villars), under dierent disguises. it can duely be

taken care of by sticking to one and the same determination of the logarithm during the

whole calculation.

an apparent problem or virtue perhaps? of the zeta function denition of innite

determinants is posed by the following example. it turns out that the determinants





6 =

yn=1

(1)2n+1,

7 =

yn=1

(1)4n+1,

. . .

(18)

and 5 are all dierent. this originates in

11
6(1) = 2h(1, 1/2)  1 = b2(1/2)  1 = 
12
23
7(1) = 4h(1, 1/4)  1 = 2b2(1/4)  1 = 
24

,

,

. . .

(19)

6

and can be interpreted as due to the change of the zeta measure of the number of factors in

the product leading to the determinant. we could try to avoid this problem by sticking always
to the most simple characterization of the eigenvalues series (in this case 1,1,1, . . .,
any reference to n being superuous). things are, regretfully, not that simple. consider the

determinants 4, 5, and

8 =



yn=1

(1)n,

and try to make compatible the apparently obvious fact that:

8 = q45.

(20)

(21)

the determinant 8 can be obtained in three dierent ways, that yield the same result.

(i) we have, through the corresponding zeta function,



1

,

(1)s  1

xn=1

8(s) =

(1)ns =
(s) = log(1)(cid:20) 1
8 = exp[ 8

8

2s2 +

1
12

+ o(s)(cid:21) ,

(0)|reg] = (1)1/12.

(22)

(ii) on the other hand, taking logs as before, from the zeta function measure of the set of

exponents, we get



log 8 = log(1)
8 = (1)r(1) = (1)1/12.

xn=1

n = log(1)r(1),

(23)

(iii) also, we may instead choose to take derivatives, term by term, in the rst expression

for the zeta function



(1)ns,



8(s) =

xn=1
(s) = 
xn=1
8 = exp[8

8

n(1)ns log(1), 8
(0)] = (1)1/12.

(0) =  log(1)



xn=1

n =

log(1)

12

,

(24)

remarkably enough, in all three cases we obtain the same result for this determinant. let

us now try to fulll the factorization condition (21). we have:





4 =

8 =

yn=1
yn=1



5 =

1 = 11/2 = 1,
(1)n = (1)1/12 = q45 = 11/4 (1)1/4.

(1) = (1)1/2 = i,

yn=1

(25)

7

the only way to fulll this property (21) is to accept that:



yn=1

1 = 1

!!

(26)

on the contrary, if we insists (as almost everybody would agree on) that the determinant of

the identity is 1, then we must give up the property that the determinant of the alternating
series of eigenvalues 1,1, 1,1, . . . is equal to the subdeterminant product of the 1s, times
the subdeterminant product of the 1s. this is the most simple reection one could ever
have expected to obtain of the multiplicative anomaly of the determinant!

if we choose to preserve, at any price, the multiplication property of the determinant and
give sense to the strange fact that det i = 1, then we do attain compatibility in eqs. (25)
by setting:



yn=1

1 = ei,



yn=1

(1) = ei/2,





yn=1

(1)n = e3i/4,

yn=1

(1)4n = e3i, . . .

(27)

all these are compatible zeta function denitions of the determinant (they can be xed
from acceptable roots of 1 or 1 as given by the zeta function exponents) satisfying the
multiplication rule. however, it is easy to see that this process cannot go for ever (and thus

eliminate the anomaly): the following dets cannot possibly fulll the multiplicative property:







yn=1

(1)2n+1 = (1)11/12 6=

yn=1

(1)2n

yn=1

(1).

(28)

but maybe this is asking too much, as has been observed before, in which case we are still

left with the compatible (albeit really weird) choice (27).

anyhow, it is easy to check that we do not nd problems in factorizations like





yn=1

(n) =

yn=1

(1)



yn=1

n,

(29)

since



(s) = (1)sr(s),
yn=1

 (0) = 
(n) = e (0) = (1)1/2 2 =

1
2

log(2),

1
2


n,

(30)



log(1) 
yn=1
(1)

yn=1

or in the more involved one





yn=1

(1)nn =

yn=1

(1)n



yn=1

n,

(31)

8

because



(s) =

xn=1

(1)nsns = ((1)s, s),
(1)nn = e (0) = (1)1/12 2 =



yn=1

 (0) =



i
12


+ (0, 1) =

i
12 

1
2

log(2),

yn=1

(1)n

yn=1

n,

(32)

being  the polylogarithm function. the factorization of the determinants holds here again,

in the zeta function prescription, and this fact does not seem to be that immediate, in view

of the last calculation as compared with what we had before.

all the above considerations may sound rather trivial, but actually they are not, and

should be carefully taken into account before proceding with the sort of manipulations of

the eigenvalues and splittings of determinants that pervade the specialized literature.

3. the multiplicative anomaly for dirac type operators

consider the ordinary dirac equation for a massive spinor

(/d + im) = 0.

(33)

usually, the determinant of the dirac operator acting in this equation is obtained by using

the following argument (see, e.g., [11]):

det(/d + im) = det(/d  im) = hdet(/d2 + m2)i1/2

.

(34)

this comes about from the fact that the spectrum of the dirac massless operator /d has
the following property: if  belongs to the spectrum, then so does , that is immediately
obtained by use of the 5 operator. then, it turns out that the rst det in eq. (34) is a

product of pairs of the form:

( + im)( + im) = (  im)(  im) = (  im)(  im),

(35)

the last being the pairs appearing in the second det of eq.

(34). this is an algebraic

argument, but there is also the corresponding geometric one, trivial after representing the

spectral points in the complex plane. thus, the rst equality in (34) is proven, and the

second seems obvious.

however, due to the existence of the multiplicative anomaly for innite determinants
[namely, the fact that, in general, det(ab) 6= (det a) (det b)], all these formulas, obtained
by simple manipulation of the eigenvalues, must be set under suspicion and are in need of a

9

rigorous check. concerning eq. (34, the second equality cannot be taken for granted, since

it may turn out that

det[(/d + im)(/d  im)] 6= det(/d + im) det(/d  im).

(36)

we will show below that this is indeed the case, in a very simple, parallel example 

completely under control that uses as operator some square root of the harmonic oscillator.

indeed, consider the square root of the harmonic oscillator obtained by delbourgo in

ref. [12]. this example has potentially some interesting physical applications, for it is well

known that a fermion in an external constant electromagnetic eld has a similar spectrum

(landau spectrum). exactly in the same way as when going from the klein-gordon to

the dirac equation and paying the same price of doubling the number of components (e.g.,

introducing spin), delbourgo has constructed a model for which there exists a square root

of its hamiltonian, which is very close to the one for the harmonic oscillator. it is in fact

dierent from the dirac oscillator introduced by several other authors, corresponding to the
minimal substitution ~p  ~p  i~r. the main dierence lies in the introduction now of the
parity operator, q. whereas creation and destruction operators for the harmonic oscillator,
a = p  ix, are non-hermitian, the combinations d = p  iqx are hermitian and

h   (d)2 = p 2 + x 2  q = 2hosc  q.

(37)

notice that the parity term commutes with hosc. doubling the components (i are the
pauli matrices)


x
the operators d are represented by

p  i1

,

x  1x,

q  2,

d  i1


x  3x.

(38)

(39)

in the sequel, we will only consider the operator d  d+. it has for eigenfunctions and

eigenvalues, respectively,



n (x) =

iex2/2

q2n+1 (n  1)!

ihhn1(x)  hn(x)/2ni
hhn1(x)  hn(x)/2ni




,




n = 

2n, n  1,

0(x) =

ex2/2

q2




1

i

,




10

0 = 0,

(40)

where the hn(x) are hermite polinomials.

the two operators we shall consider for the calculation of the anomaly are a = d + v
and b = d v , v being a real, constant potential with |v | < 2, that goes multiplied with

the identity matrix in the two (spinorial) dimensions (omitted here). obviously, this v is to

be identied with the mass m, to make contact with the case of the dirac equation that we

had at the begining.

notice that d + v and d  v are hermitian, commuting operators. the multiplicative

anomaly is dened as

a(a, b) = log det(ab)  log det a  log det b = a

(0) + b

(0)  ab

(0).

the zeta function for the operator d reads

d(s) = xi

s
i =



xn=1

[1 + (1)s](cid:16)2n(cid:17)s

= [1 + (1)s]2s/2r(s/2),

(41)

(42)

r(s) being the usual riemann zeta function, which has a simple pole at s = 1. the zeta
function for the operators d  v is (see, for instance, [13])

dv (s) = xi

(i  v )s = d(s) +

xn=1



(v )n(n + s)

n! (s)

d(n + s).

(43)

finally, the zeta function for the operator (d + v )(d  v ) = d2  v 2 is given by:

d2v 2(s) = d(2s) +

xn=1

n! (s)



v 2n(n + s)

d(2n + 2s).

(44)

we see that the anomaly in this simple case can be obtained in terms of the derivatives of

the riemann zeta function. the important fact is that it turns out to be non-zero:

a(d + v,d  v ) = 2v 2.

(45)

we should point out that this result can be obtained from the wodzicki formula for the

anomaly, even if we are working in a non-compact manifold [13]. we thus have a very simple

example of the presence of a non-trivial anomaly for operators of degree one in a space of

dimension one (spinorial, however).

one can argue that a mass term will be absorbed by renormalization and will nally yield

no physical contribution. notice, however, that the situation is much more general than the

specic case considered here, which, however, even in its simplicity already accounts for any

kind of terms not depending on the space-time coordinates. thus v can represent aside

from a mass term im a constant magnetic eld, a nite temperature term, or a chemical

potential. anomalous contributions of this kind cannot be absorbed by renormalization (see,

e.g., [14]) and can acquire a direct physical meaning [13, 15].
