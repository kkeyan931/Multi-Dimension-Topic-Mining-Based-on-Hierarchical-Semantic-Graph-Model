abstract

in the present work we consider a time-dependent schrodinger equation for systems

invariant under the reparametrization of time. we develop the two-stage procedure

of construction such systems from a given initial ones, which is not invariant under

the time reparametrization. one of the rst-class constraints of the systems in such

description becomes the time-dependent schrodinger equation. the procedure is ap-

plicable in the supersymmetric theories as well. the n = 2 supersymmetric quantum

mechanics is coupled to world-line supergravity, and the local supersymmetric ac-

tion is constructed leading to the square root representation of the time-dependent

schrodinger equation.

i. introduction

time plays a central and peculiar role in hamiltonian quantum mechanics. in

the standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics one can describe the motion of

a system by using the canonical variables which are only functions of time. the

scalar product species a direct probability of observation at one instant of time [1].

time is the sole observable assumed to have a direct physical signicance, but it is

not a dynamical variable itself. it is an absolute parameter dierently treated from

the other coordinates, which turn out to be operators and observables in quantum

mechanics.

in the cases of non-relativistic and relativistic point particles mechanics generally

covariant systems may be obtained by promoting the time t to a dynamical variable

[18]. the idea behind this transformation is to treat symmetrically the time and

dynamical variables. this is achieved by taking the time t as a function of an

arbitrary parameter  (label time) in diracs approach [2]. the arbitrariness of the

label time  is reected in the invariance of the action under the  reparametrization.

in this work we give the two-stage procedure for constructing generally covariant

systems. using additional gauge variables we rewrite the original action of the system

in the reparametrization invariant form [2,3]. the structure of the reparametrization

transformations leads to zero hamiltonian (rst-class constraint) associated to the

original action [3,6]. at the quantum theory this constraint imposes condition on

the vector states, which becomes time-independent schrodinger equation [3,8]. after

that we consider an additional action invariant under reparametrization, which does

not change the equations of motion of the original action, but modies only the

rst-class constraint, which becomes now the time-dependent schrodinger equation

[3,5]. in the case of dierent versions of supersymmetric quantum mechanics [911]

such a procedure nds its application, when the transformations of reparametrization

2

belong to a wider group of local transformations arising from the construction of the

generally covariant systems.

in this case, the set of auxiliary gauge variables are

components of the world-line supergravity multiplet [19].

here we construct a local supersymmetric action for n = 2, d = 1 supersymmetric

quantum mechanics, in which the rst-class constraint becomes time-independent

schrodinger equation, supercharges and the fermion number operator.

it is well

known, that in the case of supersymmetric quantum mechanics there is a square

root representation for the vector states of the original hamiltonian, a state with zero

energy [911,19]. it will be shown, that there exists an additional supersymmetric

invariant action, which permits the generalization of the above local supersymmetric

quantum theory. hence, we have the square root representation of the schrodinger

operator.

the plan of this work is as follows: in section 2, applying the canonical quantiza-

tion procedure to reparametrization invariant action, we obtain the time-dependent

schrodinger equation. in section 3 the same procedure is applied to relativistic case.

the extension to supersymmetric model is performed in section 4. finally, section 5

is devoted to nal remarks.

ii. non-relativistic parametrized particle dynamics

in this section the central idea is illustrated with the aid of a simple model of

parametrized dynamics.

we start by considering the theory of a non-relativistic particle moving in the

three dimensional space with dynamical variables xi (i = 1, 2, 3) and with t denoting

the ordinary physical time parameter. the action for this simplest model may be

written as

3

s0 = z (cid:26)1

2

m x2

i (t)  v (xi)(cid:27) dt,

(2.1)

where m is the mass of the particle, xi = dxi
dt

is its velocity and v (xi) is the potential.

the action (2.1) is invariant under the global translation of time

t  t + c,

c = constant.

(2.2)

we see, that the lagrangian is non-degenerate in the sense that the relation between

momentum and velocity is one to one

pi =

l
 xi = m xi.

the hamiltonian for this model has the form

h0 =

p2
i
2m

+ v (xi).

(2.3)

(2.4)

in the action (2.1) time t is an absolute parameter, dierently treated from the other

coordinates which turn out to be operators and observables in quantum mechanics.

on the other hand, it is well known, that in non-relativistic point particle mechanics

generally covariant systems may be obtained by promoting the time t to a dynamical

variable [2,3]. the same procedure has been applied to relativistic particle case [6,7].

so, we will rewrite the action (2.1) in the parametrized form

s = z ( m x2

i ( )
2n( )

 n( )v [xi( )]) d,

(2.5)

where the dot denotes derivative with respect to the parameter  . n( ) is the so

called lapse function and relates the physical time t to the arbitrary parameter

 through dt = n( )d . this canonical variable is a pure gauge variable and it

is not dynamical. n( ) in (2.5) denes the scale on which the time is measured,

and in the gauge n( ) = 1 the time parameter  is identied as the classical

time t and (2.5) becomes (2.1). on the other hand, n( ) can be viewed as one

4

dimensional gravity eld, then the action (2.5) describes the interaction between

matter xi( ) and the gravity eld n( ) [12]. the action (2.5) is invariant under

the local conformal time transformation

  =  + a( ),

if n( ) and x( ) transform as

n( ) = (an).

xi( ) = a xi( ).

(2.6)

(2.7)

this is because  s = r d

m x2
2n  n v (xi).
i

d (a l)d is a total derivative with the lagrangian l =

varying the action (2.5) with respect to x( ) and n( ) one obtains the classi-

cal equations of motion for x( ) and the constraint, respectively. the constraint

generates the local reparametrization of x( ) and n( ).

now we consider the hamiltonian analysis of this simple constrained system. we

dene the canonical momentum pi conjugate to the dynamical variable xi as

pi =

 l
 xi

=

m
n

xi,

and the classical poisson brackets between xi and pj by

{xi, pj} = j
i .

the momentum conjugate to n( ) is

pn =

 l
 n

= 0,

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

this equation merely constrains the variable n(t) (primary constraint). the canoni-

cal hamiltonian can be calculated in the usual way, it has the form hc = n h0, and

the total hamiltonian is

ht = n h0 + un pn ,

(2.11)

5

where un is the lagrange multiplier associated to the constraint pn = 0 in (2.10)

and h0 is the hamiltonian of the system dened in (2.4). the canonical evolution of

the constraint pn is given by the poisson bracket with the total hamiltonian. thus,

we have

pn = {pn , hc + un pn } = h0 = 0,

(2.12)

leading to the secondary constraint, which by denition is of the rst-class constraint

[5]. in the quantum theory the rst-class constraint associated with the invariant

action (2.5) under the transformations of reparametrization (2.6) becomes condition

on the wave function . so that any physical state must obey the following quantum

constraint

h0(pi, xi)(xl) = 0,

(2.13)

which is nothing but the time-independent schrodinger equation.

now we have to stress, that the physical meaning of the action (2.5) is dierent

from that of the starting action (2.1). indeed the equation (2.13) leads to the zero

value of the energy of systems. to correct the situation and to get a time-dependent

schrodinger equation for the parametrized system (2.5) we will proceed as follows.

we regard the following invariant action

sr = z pt(

dt
d

( ) + n( )) d.

(2.14)

now (t, pt) is a pair of dynamic conjugated variables, pt is the momentum corre-

sponding to t. the action (2.14) is invariant under reparametrization (2.6), if

pt = a pt,

t = a t,

n =

d
d

(an),

(2.15)

since sr = r d
the action (2.5) we obtain in the rst order form the total action s = s + sr

d (aptn  apt t)d is a total derivative. so, adding the action (2.14) to

6

s = z npi xi  n h0(p, x) + pt( t  n( ))o d.

(2.16)

the action (2.16) is invariant under the local transformation (2.6), if n, x, pt and t

transform according to (2.7, 2.15).

so, we will proceed with the canonical quantization of the action (2.14-2.16).

following the rules of this procedure we have two constraints corresponding to the

canonical variables t and pt

1  pt  pt = 0,

2  ppt = 0,

(2.17)

where pt =  l

 t = pt and ppt =  l

 pt

= 0 are the momenta conjugated to t and pt,

respectively.

the constraints (2.17) are of the second class, and therefore, they can be

eliminated by the diracs procedure. dening the matrix constraint cab with

(a, b = 1, 2) as a poisson bracket we nd, that the only non-zero matrix elements

are

c1,2 = {1, 2} = 1,

c2,1 = {2, 1} = 1,

(2.18)

with their inverse matrix elements (c 1)1,2 = 1 and (c 1)2,1 = 1. the diracs

brackets {, } are dened by

{a, b} = {a, b}  {a, i}(c 1)ij{j, b}.

(2.19)

the result of this procedure leads to the non-zero diracs brackets relations

{t, pt} = 1.

(2.20)

then, the canonical hamiltonian obtained from the action s in (2.16) has the form

h c = n(pt + h0),

(2.21)

and the total hamiltonian is

7

ht = n(pt + h0) + un pn ,

(2.22)

where un is the lagrange multiplier associated to the constraint pn = 0 in (2.10),

which must be conserved in the time, i.e.

pn = {pn , ht } = (pt + h0) = 0,

(2.23)

which by denition is the rst-class constraint. so, hamiltonians equation of motion

then yields

xi = {xi, ht } =

n pi
m

,

pi = {pi, ht } = n

dv
dxi

,

n = {n, ht } = un ,

t = {t, ht } = n,

pt = {pt, ht } = 0.

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

the rst two equations (2.24) and (2.25) are the equations of motion for the physical

degrees of freedom. the action (2.16) contains one extra canonical pair (t, pt) over

(2.1), but also contains the constraint (2.23). this constraint, being the only one,

is of the rst-class. furthemore, the action (2.16) describes the same number of

independent degrees of freedom as the action in (2.1). the equation (2.26) shows that

n( ) is an arbitrary function playing the role of gauge eld of the reparametrization

symmetry. if we take the gauge condition n( ) = 1, then as it follows from (2.27),

we have t =  . on the level of the equations of motion the action sr is zero, and

inserting n = t in the action s in (2.5), we can exclude the auxiliary gauge eld

8

n( ) and obtain diracs approach for reparametrization invariant action in the case

of non-relativistic systems [2,7,8].

at the quantum level diracs brackets (2.20) must be replaced by the commutator

[t, pt] = i{t, pt} = i,

(2.29)

and the classical momentum pt by the operator pt with the representation i 

t (we

assume units in which h = c = 1). following the diracs canonical quantization

the rst-class constraints must be imposed on the wave function (x, t). so, the

constraint (2.23) may be written as

d(xl, t)

dt

i

= h0(i

d
xl

, xm)(xl, t).

(2.30)

hence, the inclusion in (2.5) of an additional reparametrization invariant action

(2.14) does not change the equations of motion (2.24, 2.25), but only the constraint

(2.13), which becomes (2.23). thus, canonical quantization procedure applied to

the parametrized theory (2.16) yields the correct equation for the wave function 

(2.30), which is just the conventional time-dependent schrodinger equation.

in the following two sections it will be shown, that the same procedure without

any diculties can be extended to the relativistic and supersymmetric cases.

iii. relativistic point particle

in this section we will consider a free relativistic particle. the action in this case

has the form

s = mz q1  x2

i (t) dt,

(3.1)

where m, t and xi (i = 1, 2, 3) are, respectively, the mass, proper time and the position

of the particle. after parametrization dt = n( )d the action (3.1) becomes

9

s = mz qn 2( )  x2

i ( ) d.

(3.2)

this action is invariant under the local time reparametrization (2.6), if n( ) and

xi( ) transform as (2.7). the canonical hamiltonian in this case has the form

hc = n h0 = n (cid:18)qp2

i + m2(cid:19) ,

(3.3)

where pi =  l
 xi

= m
n

variable xi.

xi

q1

xi
n2

is the canonical momentum conjugate to dynamical

so, we will rewrite the action (3.2) by considering (2.14) in the rst order form,

we get

s = z (cid:26)pi xi + p0( x0  n)  nqp2

i + m2(cid:27) d,

(3.4)

where we have p0  pt and x0  t. following the analogous procedure of the

proceeding section, i.e. eliminating the second-class constraints by means of diracs

brackets (2.19), we get the relativistic canonical hamiltonian

h c = n h = n (cid:18)qp2

i + m2 + p0(cid:19) ,

(3.5)

where h is the classical relativistic constraint corresponding to the action (3.4). at

the quantum level this constraint becomes condition on the wave function 

 i

d
dx0

i + m2! (x0, xi) = 0,

+qp2

(3.6)

this is the time-dependent schrodinger equation for the relativistic free massive par-

ticle.

note, that if we take the lapse function as

n( ) = e( )qp2

i + m2  p0

2

,

(3.7)

and putting it in (3.5) we have then

10

h c =

e( )

2 (cid:18)qp2

i + m2  p0(cid:19)(cid:18)qp2

i + m2 + p0(cid:19) =

e( )

2 (cid:16)p2

0(cid:17) .
i + m2  p2

(3.8)

using the relations (3.7), (2.7) and (2.15) for the n( ), pi( ) and p0( ), it is easy to

show, that e( ) transforms as

e = (ae).,

(3.9)

corresponding to the transformation of n( ) in (2.7).

so, the action (3.4) takes the form

s = z (p x  e( )  p2

2

 + m2

!) d,

(3.10)

where  = 0, 1, 2, 3. the action (3.10) describes a massive relativistic particle moving

on the four dimensional space-time. the e( ) is an einbein, which plays the role of

lagrange multiplier. variation of the action (3.10) with respect to e( ) leads to the

relativistic constraint

p2
 + m2 = 0,

(3.11)

which is nothing but the mass-shell condition. when we go over to quantum me-

chanics, the constraint (3.11) is replaced by the condition on the scalar eld 

  2

x2
0



2
x2
i

+ m2! (x0, xi) = 0,

(3.12)

which is the klein-gordon equation. hence, inclusion of an additional action invari-

ant under reparametrization leads us to the schrodinger time-dependent equation

for the wave function (x, t) in the case of relativistic particle, and at the same time

it leads to the klein-gordon equation in the case of quantum scalar eld (t, x). in

this approach it is not necessary to introduce auxiliary time in order to obtain the

schrodinger equation [7].

11

iv. n=2, d= 1 supersymmetry

in the global n = 2 supersymmetric one dimensional quantum mechanics the

simplest action has the form [10,13,14]

sn=2 = z ( x2

2

 i    2(cid:16) g
x(cid:17)2

 2

2g

x2 ) dt,

(4.1)

where the overdote denotes derivatives with respect to t. in the action (4.1) x is an

even dynamical variable, unlike , which is odd. note, that the action in (4.1) is the

supersymmetric extension of (2.1).

the corresponding supersymmetric hamiltonian is

h0 =

p2
2

+ 2(cid:16) g
x(cid:17)2

+ 2

2g
x2 ,

(4.2)

where p = x,  = i  and   = i are the momenta conjugated to x,  and ,

respectively. the diracs brackets are dened as

{, } = i,

{x, p} = 1.

(4.3)

applying the noether theorema to the n = 2 supersymmetry invariant action one

nds the corresponding conserved supercharges

s =  ip + 2

g

x! ,

s = s =  ip + 2

g

x! ,

and f , which is the generator of the u(1) rotation on 

f = .

(4.4)

(4.5)

in terms of the diracs brackets (4.3) the quantities h0, s, s and f form a closed

super-algebra

{s, s} = 2ih0,

{h0, s} = {h0, s} = 0,

{s, s} = { s, s} = 0,

(4.6)

{f, s} = is,

{f, s} = i s.

12

now, our goal will be to obtain the time-dependent schrodinger equation for the

supersymmetric case. the approach will be similar to that we have followed earlier.

diracs approach applied to the action (4.1) for the n = 2 supersymmetric mechanics

in the reparametrization invariant form requires a modication. a direct way to

construct such action is a supersymmetric extension of the action (2.5), including in

the local n = 2 supersymmetry the transformations of reparametrization (2.6). as a

consequence of this extension the new gauge elds ( ), ( ) and v ( ) in the action

will appear. these gauge elds are the superpartners of the lapse function n( ).

in order to obtain the supereld formulation of the action (4.1) the transformation

of the time reparametrization (2.6) must be extended to the n = 2 local conformal

time supersymmetry (, , ) [1518]. the transformations of the supertime (, , )

can be written as

 = il(, , ) +

dil(, , ),

  = 

dil(, , ),

2

dil(, , ),

(4.7)

with the superfunction il(, , ) dened by

il(, , ) = a( ) + i ( ) + i( ) + b( ) ,

(4.8)

where d = 

 + i 

 and d =  

   i 

 are the supercovariant derivatives of the

n = 2 global supersymmetry, a( ) is a local time reparametrization parameter, ( )

is the grassmann complex parameter of the n = 2 local conformal supersymmetry

transformations and b( ) is the parameter of the local u(1) rotations on the complex

grassmann coordinates  ( = ).

then, the supereld generalization of the actions (2.5) and (4.1), which are in-

variant under the n = 2 local conformal supersymmetry transformations (4.7), has

the form [19,20].

13

sn=2 = z (cid:26)1

(4.9)

where g() is the superpotential. the local supercovariant derivatives have the form

d = in  1

2 d and d = in  1

2 d. in the supereld action (4.9) in(, , ) is absent

in the numerator of the second term, this is related to the fact that the superjacobian

of the transformations (4.7), as well as the berea

b, is equal to one and the quantity

ddd is an invariant volume.

in order to have the component action for (4.9) we must expand the superelds

in,  and the superpotential g() in taylor series with respect to , .

in the case of the real supereld in (i.e.in  = in ) we have the following expansion

in (, , ) = n( ) + i ( ) + i( ) + v ( ) ,

(4.10)

where n( ) is the lapse function,  = n 1/2( )( ) and v ( ) = n v + . the

components n, ,  and v of the supereld in(, , ) are gauge elds of the one-

dimensional n = 2 supergravity.

the supereld (4.10) transforms as the one-dimensional vector eld under the

local supersymmetric transformations (4.7)

for the real scalar matter supereld (, , ) we have

(, , ) = x( ) + i ( ) + i( ) + f ( ) ,

(4.13)

where  = n 1/2( ) and f  = n f + 1

the transformations law for the supereld (, , ) is

(4.14)

the component f ( ) in (4.13) is an auxiliary degree of freedom (non-dynamical

formations law has the form

it is clear, that the supereld action (4.9) is invariant under the n = 2 local

conformal time supersymmetry. now, we can write the expression under the integral

(4.9) by means of certain superfunction f (in , ). then, the innitesimal small

transformations of the action (4.9) under the supereld transformations (4.11,4.14)

have the form

 sn=2 =

i

2 z {d(ildf ) + d(ildf )} ddd.

(4.16)

we can see, that the integrand is a total derivative, i.e. the action (4.9) is invariant

under the n = 2 local conformal time supersymmetry.

after integration over the grassmann complex coordinates  and  we nd the

component action, where f ( ) is an auxiliary eld, and it can be eliminated using

its equation of motion. finally, the action sn=2, in terms of the components of the

superelds in and , takes the form

the action (4.17) does not contain the kinetic terms for n, ,  and v , they are

not dynamical. this fact is reected in the primary constraints

where pn , p, p  and pv are the canonical momenta conjugated to n, ,  and v ,

respectively.

then, the canonical hamiltonian for the action sn=2 in (4.17) can be calculated

in the usual way

hc = n h0 +

f,

(4.19)

where h0, s, s and f are dened in (4.2, 4.4, 4.5). therefore, the total hamiltonian

is

ht = hc + un pn + up + u p  + uv pv .

(4.20)

the secondary constraints are rst-class constraints

h0 = 0,

s = 0,

s = 0,

f = 0,

(4.21)

which are obtained using the standard diracs procedure, i.e., the time derivatives

of the primary constraints must be vanishing for all the p, x, ,  ,  and , that

satisfy the equation of motion.

in the quantum theory the rst-class constraints (4.21) associated with the in-

variance of the action (4.17) become conditions on the wave function  = (x, , ).

the quantum constraints are

16

h0 = 0, s = s = 0, f  = 0,

(4.22)

which are obtained when we change the classical dynamical variables by their corre-

sponding operators. the rst equation in (4.22) is the schrodinger equation, a state

with zero energy. therefore, we have the time-independent schrodinger equation,

this fact is due to the invariance under the reparametrization symmetry of the action

(4.17), this problem is well-known as the problem of time [16].

so, in order to have a time-dependent schrodinger equation for the supersym-

metric quantum mechanics, we consider the generalization of the reparametrization

invariant action sr in (2.14). in the case of n = 2 local supersymmetry it has the

supereld form

sr(n=2) = z (cid:26)ip 

i

in 1(dtdip  dip dt)(cid:27) ddd.

(4.23)

the action (4.23) is determined in terms of the new superelds t and ip . the

supereld t is determined by the odd complex time ( ) and ( ), which are the

superpartners of the time t( ) and one auxiliary eld m( ). explicitly, we have

t(, , ) = t( ) + ( )   ( ) + m( ) ,

(4.24)

where ( ) = n 1/2( )( ) and m( ) = n m + i

2 (  + ). the transformation
rule for the supereld t(, , ) under the n = 2 local conformal supersymmetry

transformations (4.7) is

t = il t +

the supereld ip (, , ) has the form

ip (., ) = ( ) + ip

( ) + ip

( ) + p

t( ) ,

(4.25)

(4.26)

where p

( ) = n 1/2p( ) and p

2( p p). p and p are the odd complex
momenta, i.e. superpartners of the momentum pt. the supereld ip transforms as

t = n pt+ 1

(4.27)

it is easy to show, that the innitesimal small transformations of the action sr(n=2)

under the transformations (4.11, 4.25, 4.27) is a total derivative, then the action

sr(n=2) is invariant under the n = 2 local supersymmetric transformations (4.7).

after integration over  and  the action (4.23) may be written in its component

form. we obtain

sr(n=2) = z (pt(n  t) + i p + i p +

(4.28)

one can show that the variables  and m are auxiliary, in the sense, that they can

be eliminated from the physical variables by some unitary transformation.

so, the component action has the nal form

2

sr(n=2) = z (pt(n  t) + i p + i p +

(p  p)(cid:27) d.

(4.29)

we can see from (4.29) that the action sr(n=2) contains sr term and the additional

terms related to the n = 2 local supersymmetry transformations of the components

of the superelds t, ip and in.

varying the action (4.29) with respect to pt, p and p we obtain the relations

between n, , , t,  and , which are the generalization of (2.27)

n( ) = t +

( )( ),

(4.30)

where d =   i

2 v  and d  =  + i

2 v  are the u(1) supercovariant derivatives.

fullling the relations (4.30) the action (4.29) vanishes.

proceeding to the hamiltonization, in addition to the second-class constraints

obtained in (2.17) corresponding to the canonical variables t and pt, we have the

following constraints

18

3() = p + ip = 0,

4(p) = pp = 0,

(4.31)

5() = p + ip = 0,

6(p) = pp  = 0,

where p = lr(n=2)

 

, pp = lr(n=2)

 p

are the odd momenta conjugated to , p and

their respective complex conjugate. we dene the odd canonical poisson brackets as

{, p} = 1,

{p, pp} = 1.

(4.32)

so, the constraints (4.31) are of the second-class. dening the matrix (symmetric

for the grassmann variables) constraint cik (i, k = , p, , p) as the odd poisson

brackets, we have the following non-zero matrix elements

c,p = cp, = {3, 4} = i,

c,p  = cp , = {5, 6} = i

(4.33)

with their inverse matrix (c 1),p = i and (c 1),p  = i. using the diracs

brackets {, } dened in (2.19) we obtain, that the only non-zero matrix elements

are

{, p} = i,

{, p} = i.

so, if we take the additional term (4.28) the full action will be

s = sn=2 + sr(n=2).

(4.34)

(4.35)

then, the canonical hamiltonian for the action s will have the form

h c = n(pt + h0) 


2

(s + s) +


2

(s + s) +

v
2

(f + f ),

(4.36)

where s = (p + pt), s = (p  pt) and f = (p  p).

then the total hamiltonian may be written as

h t = h c + un pn + up + u p  + uv pv .

(4.37)

due to the conditions

19

pn = p = p  = pv = 0,

(4.38)

we now have the rst-class constraints

h = pt + h0,

q = s + s,

q = s + s,

f = f + f.

(4.39)

the constraints (4.39) form a closed superalgebra with respect to the diracs brackets

{q, q} = 2ih,

{h, q} = {h, q} = 0,

(4.40)

{f , q} = iq,

{f , q} = iq.

after quantization the diracs brackets (4.34) become anticomutator for the odd

variables

{, p} = i{, p} = 1,

{, p} = i{, p} = 1,

(4.41)

with the operator representation p =  

  . in order to obtain the
quantum expression for h, q, q and f we use the operator representation p = i d
dx

 and p =  

and ,  as {, } = 1,  = () and  = (+), where  = 1

2(1  i2) in our case

for the generators (4.41) on the quantum level, we have

h = i

t are the generators of supertranslations on the superspace with

t is the ordinary time translation operator

{s, s} = 2i


t

(4.43)

and f =  

  is the generator of the u(1) rotation on the complex grassmann
coordinates  ( = ). the algebra of the quantum generators h, s, s and f is a

 +  

closed superalgebra

20

{s, s} = 2h0,

[s, h0] = [ s, h0] = [f, h0] = 0,

(4.44)

[f, s] = s,

[f, s] = s,

s2 = s2 = 0,

the conserved quantities are h, s, s and f . we can see, that the generators h, q, q

and f satisfy the same superalgebra

{q, q} = 2h,

[q, h] = [q, h] = [f , h] = 0,

(4.45)

[f , q] = q,

[f , q] = q,

q2

 = q2

 = 0.

in the quantum theory the rst-class constraints (4.42) become conditions on the

wave function . so, we have the supersymmetric quantum constraints

h = 0, q = 0, q = 0, f  = 0.

(4.46)

we will search the wave function in the supereld form, we regard

(t, , , , ) = (t, x, , ) + i(t, x, , ) + i(t, x, , ) +

(4.47)

+(t, x, , ).

this wave function must satisfy the quantum constraints (4.46). in (4.47) ,  are

even components of the wave function, unlike , , which are odd. we take the

constraints

q = 0,

q = 0.

due to the algebra (4.45) we have

{q, q} = 2h = 0.

(4.48)

(4.49)

this is the time-dependent schrodinger equation for the supersymmetric quantum

mechanics.

the condition (4.48) leads to the following form of the wave function

21

 =  + (s) + ( s) 

( ss  s s),

then, q has the form

q = (i

{s, s}) = 0,

(4.50)

(4.51)

this is the standard time-dependent schrodinger equation

i

d(t, , )

dt

= h0(p, x, , )(t, x, , ),

(4.52)

due to the relation h0 = 1

2{s, s}. if we put in the schrodinger equation (4.52) the
dt = 0, we will have h0 = 0 and due to
the algebra (4.44) we obtain s = s = 0 and the wave function  becomes wave

condition of the stationary states given by d

function (x, , ) [10,11,19,20].

v. conclusions

without any diculties our procedure may be generalized to d-dimensional ex-

tended supersymmetry mechanics [14,21]. this is due to the fact, that the full

algebra of the transformations is closed on o-shell, and it is a n = 2 local confor-

mal supersymmetry. so, our procedure represents a direct possibility to apply the

batalin-vilkovsky formalism [2224] to supersymmetric systems.

in this work we have considered systems (including susy), which are not parame-

trized. such systems always may be done in a parametrized invariant form. for this

purpose we must include auxiliary gauge degree of freedom. hence, the constraint

system contains generator of reparametrization, which is the hamiltonian genera-

tor. its operator must annihilate the physical states, this leads to time-independet

schrodinger equation h0 = 0 for states with zero energy.

22

in order to have a time-dependent schrodinger equation, i.e. to describe the quan-

tum evolution of a system, as we shown in this work, an additional invariant action

sr may be always constructed. the additional action does not change the equation

of motions, but the constraint system, which becomes time-dependent schrodinger

equation. from our point of view, this fact is very important in those cases, when

starting systems are invariant under reparametrization of time, such systems as: gen-

eral relativity, cosmological models, string theories. these theories contain auxiliary

additional gauge degree of freedom (lapse and shift functions) [25]. such theories

have the problem which in literature is known as the problem of time [1,3]. for

instance, the wheeler-dewitt equation [26].

naturally, the question arising as a result of this work is: could we construct an

additional invariant under general covariant transformations action? if the result of

this question is positive, then the additional action will remain without any changes

the equations for the physical degree of freedom of the system, but the constraint

will be modied leading to time-dependent schrodinger equation.
