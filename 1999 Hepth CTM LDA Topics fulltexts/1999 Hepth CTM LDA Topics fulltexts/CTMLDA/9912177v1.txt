abstract

we analyze the world-volume solitons of a d3-brane probe in the background of parallel
(p, q) ve-branes. the d3-brane is embedded along the directions transverse to the ve-
branes of the background. by using the s-duality invariance of the d3-brane, we nd a rst-
order dierential equation whose solutions saturate an energy bound. the so(3) invariant
solutions of this equation are found analytically. they represent world-volume solitons which
can be interpreted as formed by parallel (q, p) strings emanating from the d3-brane world-
volume. it is shown that these congurations are 1/4 supersymmetric and provide a world-
volume realization of the hanany-witten eect.

1 introduction

the study of the solitons of the world-volume theories which describe the dynamics of branes
has provided a lot of information about the dierent aspects of brane physics and of their
interrelations [1]. an interesting aspect of these soliton solutions is that they have the
spacetime interpretation of branes ending on the world-volume. in fact, dierent supergravity
solutions, which represent spacetime congurations of intersecting branes, have been realized
as solitons on the world-volume [2, 3, 4]. these results have allowed to perform several
consistency checks of the dierent approaches to describe branes in string theory and of its
connections to yang-mills theories.

of particular interest are the world-volume solitons of brane probes which move in the su-
pergravity background created by another brane. in some of these cases the background acts
as a source for the world-volume gauge eld and, thus, induces a soliton on the world-volume
of the brane probe. the resulting conguration is a triple intersection of the background,
probe and soliton branes.

an example of this last type of systems is the baryon vertex [5], in which a d5-brane
moves in ads5  s5, which is the near-horizon geometry of a stack of parallel d3-branes. a
bps equation for the embedding of the d3-brane in ads5 s5 was proposed in ref. [6]. this
equation was analyzed in ref. [7], where it was generalized to the full geometry of the d3-
brane background. in ref. [8] the bps condition was reobtained as a saturation condition of
an energy bound. these results were generalized in ref. [9], where the system of a d(8  p)-
brane in the background of a dp-brane for p  6 was studied and the corresponding bps
condition was obtained and integrated analytically. moreover, in ref. [10] it was shown that
the bps condition obtained from the energy argument is precisely the one needed to preserve
1/4 supersymmetry. in all these systems the world-volume soliton is a spike which can be
interpreted as a bundle of fundamental strings emanating from the brane probe.

in this paper we extend the results of refs.

[6]-[10] to the case of a d3-brane probe
in the background of a stack of parallel (p, q) ve-branes (the case of a d3-brane in the
background of neveu-schwarz ve-branes was studied in ref. [11]). the (p, q) ve-brane is
a magnetically charged object under both the neveu-schwarz (ns) and ramond (r) three-
form eld strengths of the type iib supergravity, i.e. is the magnetic analogue of the (p, q)
strings studied by schwarz [12]. it can be regarded as a bound state of p ns5-branes and
q d5-branes. the complete form of this background was obtained in ref. [13] by using the
sl(2, zz ) s-duality symmetry of the type iib supergravity.

the s-duality symmetry will be very important in our approach. indeed, it is well-known
[1] that the d3-brane is invariant under this symmetry. at the level of the world-volume
action, this invariance is reected by the fact that one can convert the problem of a d3-brane
in a (p, q) ve-brane background into the problem of a d3-brane in a d5-brane background.
a bps condition for the latter was found in ref.
[9] and, thus, by inverting the s-duality
transformation, one can obtain a bps condition for the (p, q) ve-brane background. this
condition can be integrated analytically and we will show that the corresponding world-
volume soliton can be interpreted as a bundle of (q, p) strings. we will also prove that this
conguration is 1/4 supersymmetric.
in section 2 we will describe the (p, q) ve-brane

this paper is organized as follows.

background. in section 3 we will analyze the action and equations of motion of the d3-brane
probe and, in particular we will put its energy functional in a form in which the invariance
under s-duality is manifest. a bps condition minimizing the energy will be found in section
4, where we will also obtain the explicit form of the world-volume solitons. the analysis of
the supersymmetries preserved by our solution will be the subject of section 5. in this section
we will rederive the bps condition as the one to be imposed if 1/4 supersymmetry is required.
finally, in section 6 we summarize our results and discuss some possible generalizations of
our work.

2 the (p, q) ve-brane background

the massless bosonic elds of the type iib superstring theory in the nsns sector are the
graviton g, the dilaton  and an antisymmetric kalb-ramond eld b. in the rr sector
the type iib theory has an scalar , an antisymmetric tensor eld c and a four-form gauge
eld whose eld strength is a self-dual ve-form. when this ve-form eld strength is zero,
the equations of motion of the type iib supergravity [14] can be derived from an action
whose bosonic part, written in the einstein frame, is given by:

siib = z d10xg" r

e2   



1

12 h e h h  + e(cid:16) g   h(cid:17)(cid:16) g   h (cid:17)i # .

in this action h is the eld strength of the nsns b eld:

whereas g is given by:

h = db ,

g = dc .

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

the action (2.1), and the equations of motion derived from it, are invariant under an
sl(2, ir) group of transformations. this is the so-called s-duality of the type iib eec-
tive action, which is a non-perturbative symmetry of the theory. the nsns and rr gauge
elds transform as a doublet of this sl(2, ir) symmetry, whereas the dilaton and rr scalar
are mixed under s-duality. at the quantum level, only the discrete subgroup sl(2, zz ) of
sl(2, ir) survives. actually, one can generate a multiplet of solutions by acting with the
sl(2, zz ) symmetry on a particular solution. this is the method used by schwarz [12] to
construct new string-like solutions of the type iib string theory starting from the fundamen-
tal string, i.e.
from a solution electrically charged under the nsns gauge eld. one gets
in this way a series of extremal solutions labeled by two integers p and q, which are usually
referred to as (p, q) strings.

one can apply the same procedure to the magnetically charged nsns solution, which is
nothing but the ns ve-brane (ns5). this construction has been undertaken by lu and roy

2

in ref. [13] and as a result one gets an innite family of ve-branes of the type iib eective
action. each member of this family is labeled by two integers p and q, which represent,
respectively, the magnetic charges under the nsns and rr gauge elds. the (p, q) = (1, 0)
solution is the ns5-brane one starts with, the (p, q) = (0, 1) is the d5-brane and a general
(p, q) ve-brane can be regarded as an extremal bound state of p ns5-branes and q d5-
branes. since this is the type iib background we are interested in, let us describe it in detail
following ref. [13].

the metric for an stack of n parallel (p, q) ve-branes is given by:

4 ( dt2 + dx2

ds2 = h h(p,q)(r)i 1
where xi
k (i = 1,   , 5) are the coordinates along which the ve-brane is extended and we
have used spherical coordinates to parametrize the directions transverse to the ve-brane.
(d2
3 represents the metric of the unit three sphere). in the metric written above, h(p,q)(r)
is an harmonic function:

k ) + h h(p,q)(r)i

4 ( dr2 + r2 d2

(2.4)

3 ) ,

3

where the radius r(p,q) is given by:

h(p,q)(r) = 1 +

r2
(p,q)
r2

,

(2.5)

(2.6)

r2

(p,q) = n h (p,q)i

2  .

in eq. (2.6)  is the regge slope and (p,q) can be put in terms of the string coupling constant
gs and of the asymptotic value of the rr scalar 0 as follows:
s p2 + ( q + p0 )2 gs .

(p,q) = g1

(2.7)

let us recall that the string coupling constant gs is related to the asymptotic value of the
dilaton 0 = (r = ) by means of the expression:
gs = e0 .

(2.8)

the dilaton eld for the stack of (p, q) ve-branes at an arbitrary value of r is given by:

e =

p2 e0 h h(p,q)(r)i

(p,q) e0

1

2 + ( q + p0 )2 e0 h h(p,q)(r)i 1

2

,

(2.9)

whereas the rr scalar takes the form:

 =

(p,q) 0 + pq e0(cid:16)1  h(p,q)(r)(cid:17)

p2 e0 h(p,q)(r) + ( q + p0 )2 e0

.

(2.10)

in order to determine completely the solution, it remains to give the values of the nsns
and rr gauge elds. their eld strengths h and g can be written1 in terms of the volume
element 3 of the three dimensional sphere as follows:

h = 2 p n  3 ,

g = 2 q n  3 .

(2.11)

1notice that the action of type iib supergravity written in ref.

[13] diers from the one above in the
change g  g. therefore, in order to write the (p, q) ve-brane solution with our conventions, this same
change must be done in the solution of ref. [13].

3

from the values of the eld strengths displayed in eq. (2.11) it is clear that the object which
generates the metric (2.4) and the values of the dilaton and rr scalar of eqs. (2.9) and
(2.10) is magnetically charged under the nsns and rr gauge elds, i.e. extended along the
direction of the potentials of the hodge duals of h and g. moreover, the (p, q) ve-brane
solution is extremal in the sense that preserves 1/2 of the supersymmetries of the type iib
supergravity. the killing spinors corresponding to this solution will be given in section 5.

3 the d3-brane probe

let us now consider a d3-brane probe embedded along the transverse directions of the stack
of (p, q) ve-branes described in sect. 2. the action of this d3-brane probe is the sum of the
dirac-born-infeld term and the wess-zumino term:

where the expressions of sdbi and sw z in the einstein frame are given by:

s = sdbi + sw z ,

sdbi =  t3 z d4qdet ( g + e 
sw z = t3 z d4 hf  c +

2 f ) ,
f  f i .

1
2

(3.1)

(3.2)

in eq. (3.2) g is the induced world-volume metric, c is the pullback of the rr gauge eld
and f is

(3.3)

f = da  b = f  b ,

where a is a u(1) world-volume gauge eld, f is its eld strength and b is the pullback of
the kalb-ramond eld of the ns sector of the superstring. notice that in sw z the eld c
acts as a source for the world-volume electric charge, whereas the rr scalar  couples to the
instanton number density of f . the coecient t3 multiplying the two terms of the action
is the tension of the d3-brane which, in terms of the regge slope , can be written as:

t3 =

1

83 (  )2 .

(3.4)

let us parametrize the transverse three-sphere by means of three angles 1, 2 and 3, where
3   is the polar angle (0    ). the line element d2
3 in these coordinates is given by:

d2

3 = ( d)2 + ( sin  )2 [ ( d2 )2 + ( sin 2 )2 ( d1 )2 ] .

let us denote by g the determinant of the metric (3.5). it is clear that:

g = ( sin  )2 sin 2 ,

and, therefore, the volume element 3 can be written in these coordinates as:

3 = g d1  d2  d .

4

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

we shall take the angles i, together with the time variable t as world-volume coordinates
, i.e.  = ( t , 1 , 2 , 3 ). actually, we are going to consider static (i.e. time indepen-
dent) congurations of the d3-brane which correspond to a radial deformation of the probe.
accordingly, the only active scalar will be the coordinate r, which we will take to depend
only on the polar angle . these congurations are invariant under an so(3) symmetry,
which is the maximal amount of symmetry that a radial deformation can have. as was
mentioned above, the rst term in sw z in eq. (3.2) couples the world-volume gauge eld to
the rr background potential c. actually, by using the expression (3.3) of f and integrating
by parts, one can easily verify that this term of sw z couples the time component a0 of the
u(1) world-volume eld to the rr eld strength g. because of this coupling, we cannot
take a0 to vanish. in what follows we shall assume that a0 depends only on the polar angle
, which again corresponds to the maximally symmetric solution. on the other hand, the
ns eld b couples to the brane probe through f (see eq. (3.3)). moreover, it is possible to
choose a gauge in which the only non-vanishing component of b is b1 2. indeed, one can
take b as:

where b() must verify2:

b = 2p n  sin 2 b() d1  d2 ,

d
d

b() = ( sin )2 .

(3.8)

(3.9)

in what follows we shall adopt the gauge (3.8) and, accordingly, we shall assume that the
only non-vanishing components of f are f0 = f0 and f12  f12. the action s for
these congurations is:

3

s = t3 t z d3(sr4h h(p,q)(r)i
 sh h(p,q)(r)i
2 ( r2 + r  2 )  e f 2

1

12 

2 g + e f 2
0  2qn g a0 + f12 f0) ,

(3.10)

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to the polar angle  and t = r dt. let us

now dene the quantity:

 

1

t3 t

s
f0

.

(3.11)

by using the form of s given in eq. (3.10), one can nd the expression of  in terms of f0
and f12, namely:

 =

rr4h h(p,q)(r)i

1

3

2 g + e f 2

12

rh h(p,q)(r)i

2 ( r2 + r  2 )  e f 2

0

e f0 + f12 .

(3.12)

moreover, the euler-lagrange equation for a0 can be written as the following equation for
:

  = 2qn g ,

(3.13)

2the label  of the function b() represents the constant of integration of equation (3.9). the explicit

expression of b() will be given in section 4.

5

which is nothing but the gauss law constraint for the world-volume gauge eld. notice that
the right-hand side of eq. (3.13) only depends on the angles and, thus, the gauss law can be
integrated and, as a result, one can obtain  as a function of the s. similarly, by computing
the exterior derivative of f = da  b, we get the bianchi identity for f :

d f = h ,

(3.14)

which implies that f0 is independent of the angles 1 and 2 (in agreement with our as-
sumption that a0 only depends on ) and the following dierential equation for f12:

 f12 = 2pn g .

(3.15)

the similarity of eqs. (3.13) and (3.15) is manifest. it is clear that eq. (3.15) could also be
integrated and one could obtain f12 as a function of the angles . we are going to postpone
the integration of these equations until the next section. however we shall proceed as if 
and f12 were known functions and we will try to put the action in terms of them. it is clear
from eq. (3.10) that one must eliminate f0 and a0 in favor of  and f12. this can be done
by inverting the relation between  and f0. the result of this inversion is:

f0 =

rr4h h(p,q)(r)i

rh h(p,q)(r)i

3

1

2 ( r2 + r  2 )

2 g + e f 2

12 + e (   f12 )2

e (   f12 ) .

(3.16)

moreover, by using the gauss law (3.13) and integrating by parts, we can rewrite the wz
term of the action as:

sw z = t3 t z d3 (   f12 ) f0 .

(3.17)

by means of eq. (3.16), and after representing the wz term as in eq. (3.17), one can write
the total action s as:

where u is given by:

s = t u ,

u = t3 z d3qr2 + r  2 
 s[ (p,q) ]2 + h h(p,q)(r)i

1

2 (cid:16) e f 2

12 + e (   f12 )2(cid:17) .

in eq. (3.19) (p,q) denotes:

(p,q)  r2 h(p,q)(r) g .

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

it is clear from eq. (3.18) that s and u give rise to the same euler-lagrange equations. in
fact, one can regard u as the result of performing a legendre transformation to s and, thus,
u can be considered as an energy functional for the d3-brane probe in the (p, q) ve-brane
geometry. the equations of motion derived from u are simply the conditions required to
have minimal energy congurations.

6

an important point, which we shall exploit in the next section, is that u can be written
in a way which makes manifest its sl(2, ir) invariance. in order to recast u as a function
explicitly invariant under s-duality, let us dene the matrix:

2 + e2 



m = 

d = 


f12





1

e ,




.

(3.21)

(3.22)

and the vector

by inspecting eq. (3.19) and the denitions (3.21) and (3.22), one immediately veries that
u can be put as:

u = t3 z d3qr2 + r  2 s2

(p,q) + h h(p,q)(r)i

let  be an arbitrary 2  2 sl(2, ir) matrix of the form:

 = (cid:18) a b

d(cid:19) ,

c

ad  bc = 1 ,

1

2 dt m d .

(3.23)

(3.24)

where a, b, c and d are constant real numbers. it is now obvious from eq. (3.23) that u is
invariant under the following simultaneous transformation of m and d:

m   m t ,

(3.25)
notice that the matrix m encodes the information of the scalar elds of the background.
actually, this same matrix m appears when the background action (2.1) is written in an
sl(2, ir)-invariant form [1]. it is well-known that if one assembles the rr scalar  and the
dilaton  into a complex scalar  as:

d  ( 1 )t d .

(3.26)
then, the transformation law of m (see eq. (3.25)) is equivalent to a mobius bilinear trans-
formation of the complex scalar :

 =  + i e ,

 

a + b
c + d

.

(3.27)

it follows from eq.
(3.25) that the sl(2, ir) transformation of the background must be
accompanied by a transformation of d, which can be regarded as an electric-magnetic duality
rotation of the world-volume gauge elds. notice that under this symmetry the gauss law
and the bianchi identity are mixed. this connection between world-volume electric-magnetic
symmetry and s-duality of the background is well-known [15]-[20]. in the next section we
shall use it to map our problem to a system in which the d3-brane is in the background of a
d5-brane, i.e. we will reduce our problem for arbitrary values of the integers p and q to the
case in which (p, q) = (0, 1). this d5-d3 system was studied in ref. [9] and its equation of
motion was integrated exactly by means of a bps rst-order condition. in section 4 we will
be able to translate this bps condition of the d5-d3 system into a condition for the (p, q)
ve-brane case and, as a consequence, we will nd exact solutions for the embedding of the
d3-brane in the general (p, q) background.

7

4 the bps equation

in this section we will nd a rst-order (bps) dierential equation [21] whose solutions
minimize the energy functional of the d3-brane [22]. our strategy to nd this bps equation
will be the following. first of all we shall perform an s-duality transformation which converts
the background of eqs. (2.4), (2.9), (2.10) and (2.11) into a solution of iib supergravity with
line element given by eq. (2.4) in which only the dilaton  and the rr eld strength g are
non-vanishing. the problem of minimizing the energy in the dual variables has been solved
in ref.
[9]. after transforming back to our original elds, we will get the minimal energy
congurations of our system.

the form of the sl(2, ir) matrix with the properties required for our purposes is not
dicult to nd. actually, the (p, q) ve-brane background was found in ref. [13] by means
of an s-duality transformation of a solution in which only one of the two three-form eld
strengths is non-vanishing. by adapting the results of ref.
[13], it is straightforward to
conclude that the matrix  suited for our objectives has the following elements:

2 ,

a = e0 (q + p0 )h (p,q)i 1
b = (cid:16) e0 (q + p0 ) 0 + e0 p(cid:17)h (p,q)i 1
c = ph (p,q)i 1
d = qh (p,q)i 1

2 ,

2 .

2 ,

let us call m(d) to the transformed m matrix, i.e.:

m(d) =  m t .

(4.1)

(4.2)

after some algebra, one can check that, when the matrix elements of  are those displayed
in eq. (4.1), the dual matrix m(d) has the simple form:

m(d) = 


1
2

h h(p,q)(r)i

0

0

h h(p,q)(r)i 1

2

.




this matrix corresponds to the following values of the dilaton and rr scalar:

(4.3)

(4.4)

e(d)

= h h(p,q)(r)i

1

2 ,

(d) = 0 ,

which are the values of  and  for a d5-brane solution of type iib supergravity. moreover,
after the transformation, the vector d takes the form:
d(d) = (  1)t d = 


f (d)
(d)




(4.5)

12

,

8

where:

f (d)
12 = d f12 + c  ,

(d) = a  + bf12 .

in terms of the dual variables, the energy functional is simply given by:

u = t3 z d3qr2 + r  2 r2

(p,q) + (cid:16) (d)(cid:17)2

12 (cid:17)2
+ h(p,q)(r)(cid:16)f (d)

.

(4.6)

(4.7)

from eq. (4.6) and the gauss law and bianchi identity for the original variables  and
f12 (eqs. (3.13) and (3.15)), it is immediate to obtain the equation that determines the
dependence on  of f (d)

12 , namely:

 f (d)

12 = ( qc  pd ) 2 n  g .

(4.8)

by using the explicit values of the coecients d and c from eq. (4.1), one can verify that the
right-hand side of eq. (4.8) vanishes, i.e.:

 f (d)

12 = 0 .

(4.9)

eq. (4.9) is simply the bianchi identity for the dual variables. as the dual background has
vanishing nsns gauge eld, the result of eq. (4.9) was to be expected. moreover, it follows
from the analysis of ref. [9] that the d3-brane congurations which minimize the energy in
a d5 background are such that the magnetic components of the world-volume eld strength
are zero. thus, in order to solve the equations of motion derived from u, we shall adopt the
ansatz:

f (d)
12 = 0 .

(4.10)

if this condition holds, it implies from (4.6) the following relation between f12 and :

f12 = 

c
d

 = 

p
q

 ,

(4.11)

which is, in principle, valid only when q 6= 0 (we will consider the q = 0 case below). using
the relation (4.11) in eq. (4.6), we can get (d) in terms of , namely:

(d) =  h (p,q)i

q

1
2

 .

(4.12)

let us now determine  by integrating the gauss law constraint (3.13). taking eq. (3.6)
into account, one can solve eq. (3.13) as follows:

where b() satises the dierential equation (3.9). it is immediate to verify that:

 = 2q n  sin 2 b() ,

b() =

1
2

[   cos  sin    ] ,

9

(4.13)

(4.14)

is the general solution of eq. (3.9). in eq. (4.14)  is an integration constant which, for
example, determines the value of b() at  = . by plugging in eq. (4.12) the expression of
 given by (4.13), one can obtain (d) as a function of the angles. one gets:

(d) = = 2 r2

(p,q) sin 2 b() .

similarly, from eqs. (4.11) and (4.13) we can determine f12:
f12 = 2pn sin 2 b() .

(4.15)

(4.16)

it is immediate to verify that, indeed, the expression of f12 given in eq.
(4.16) solves
the bianchi identity (3.15). actually, we could have obtained f12 by direct integration
of eq. (3.15). the advantage of our present derivation based on s-duality is that it xes
uniquely the integration constant of this equation. moreover, if one chooses the gauge for b
as in eq. (3.8), i.e. with the same constant  as is in eq. (4.16), one has:

which implies that:

f12 = b12 ,

f12 = 0 .

(4.17)

(4.18)

notice that eq. (4.18) implies that the spatial components ai of the world-volume gauge
eld vanish and, therefore, only a0 is non-zero and depends on the polar angle .

let us now dene the function d(p,q)() as:

d(p,q)()  2 r2

(p,q) b() .

(4.19)

the eld strength f12 and the dual momentum (d) can be rewritten in terms of d(p,q)().

indeed, by using eq. (2.6), one arrives at:

while (d) is given by:

f12 =

p

[(p,q)]

1
2

sin 2 d(p,q)() ,

(d) = sin 2 d(p,q)() .

(4.20)

(4.21)

let us now consider the problem of nding the embeddings of the d3-brane with minimal
energy u. first of all, we can substitute in the expression of u written in eq. (4.7) the values
of f (d)
12 and (d) that we have obtained (eqs. (4.10) and (4.21)). as, by assumption, r only
depends on the polar angle , it is possible to integrate over the other two angles 1 and 2,
with the result:

u = 4 t3 z d r2 + r  2 q[ (p,q)(r, ) ]2 + [ d(p,q)() ]2 ,

where:

(p,q)(r, )  r2 h(p,q)(r) ( sin  )2 .

(4.22)

(4.23)

eq. (4.22) will be the starting point in our determination of the minimal energy congura-
tions. before proceeding further, let us point out that eq. (4.22) is also valid when q = 0,

10

i.e. when the background is purely ns. actually, although some of our intermediate equa-
tions are ill-dened when q = 0, the nal expressions for  and f12 (eqs. (4.13) and (4.16)
respectively) are perfectly well-behaved in this case, and one can readily check that they
solve the gauss law and the bianchi identity for q = 0. by substituting these q = 0 values
of  and f12 in eq. (3.19), one can easily conclude that the energy u is given by eq. (4.22)
also when q = 0. therefore, we will assume that this value is included in what follows.
the minimal energy embeddings of the d3-brane are characterized by a function r()
which satises the euler-lagrange equation of motion derived from u. this equation of
motion is a rather complicated second-order dierential equation which, in general, we will
not be able to solve. instead, we will nd a rst-order dierential equation for r() whose
solutions saturate an energy bound and, thus, also solve the euler-lagrange equation. in
order to nd this rst-order equation we follow closely refs. [8, 9]. first of all, we dene the
function f(p,q)(r, ) as follows:

f(p,q)(r, ) 

(p,q)(r, ) sin  + d(p,q)() cos 
(p,q)(r, ) cos   d(p,q)() sin 

.

(4.24)

in terms of f(p,q)(r, ) it is easy to check that the square root in u can be written as a sum
of squares. one has:

u = 4 t3 z d 

sz 2 + r2h (p,q)( r ,  ) cos   d(p,q)() sin i2h r

r  f(p,q)(r, )i2

, (4.25)

where z is given by:

z = rh (p,q)( r ,  ) cos   d(p,q)() sin ih 1 +

r
r

f(p,q)(r, )i .

from eq. (4.25) we obtain immediately that u satises the bound:

which is saturated when r() satises the following rst-order dierential equation:

u  4 t3 z d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

r
r

= f(p,q)(r, ) .

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

eq. (4.28) is the rst-order dierential equation we were looking for. it is easy to prove that
any function r() that satises (4.28) also solves the euler-lagrange equation. moreover, z
can be written as a total derivative:

z =

d

d h d(p,q)() r cos  + (cid:16) 1

3

+

r2

(p,q)

r2 (cid:17) ( r sin  )3i .

(4.29)

eq. (4.29) holds for an arbitrary function r().
in fact, in order to demonstrate it, one
only has to use the value of the derivative of d(p,q)(), which can be easily obtained from

11

its explicit expression (eq. (4.19)). the main consequence of eq. (4.29) is that only the
boundary values of r() contribute to the energy bound of eq. (4.27) and, thus, the solutions
of (4.28) certainly minimize the energy for given boundary conditions. we will refer to
eq. (4.28) as the bps condition.
in section 5 we will reobtain this condition as the one
needed for preservation of 1/4 of supersymmetry. in order to establish this connection with
supersymmetry, it is interesting to recast the bps condition as an ansatz for the electric
components f0 of the world-volume eld strength. recall that f0, as a function of  and
f12 was given in eq. (3.16). actually, by using the values of the dilaton and rr scalars in
the (p, q) ve-brane background (eqs. (2.9) and (2.10)), together with the expressions of 
and f12 (eqs. (4.13) and (4.16)), one can prove, after some calculation, that:

e(cid:16)   f12 ) = h h(p,q)(r)i 1

2

q + p0

1
2

h (p,q)i

e0 sin 2 d(p,q)() .

(4.30)

by using eq. (4.30) to determine the right-hand side of eq. (3.16), it is not dicult to nd
the following expression for f0:

f0 = 

e0

q + p0

1
2

h (p,q)i

r2 + r 2

rh (p,q)(r, )i2

+ h d(p,q)()i2

d(p,q)() .

(4.31)

moreover, if r() satises the bps condition (4.28), one can readily check that:

r2 + r 2

rh (p,q)(r, )i2

+ h d(p,q)()i2

d(p,q)() = ( r cos  ) ,

(4.32)

it is also interesting to relate f12 to r() and its derivative. this can be done by rewriting
the bps condition (4.28) as:

d(p,q)() =

(r cos )
(r sin ) (p,q)(r, ) .

(4.35)

after substituting d(p,q)(), as given in eq. (4.35), on the right-hand side of eq. (4.20), one
gets:

sin 2 (r cos )

(r sin ) (p,q)(r, ) .

(4.36)

f12 =

p

1
2

h (p,q)i

12

which implies that, when the bps condition is fullled, the electric eld f0 takes the value:

f0 = 

e0 ( r cos  ) .

(4.33)

notice that, as f0 =  a0, the time component of the world-volume gauge eld is related
to r() as:

a0() =

e0 r() cos  .

(4.34)

q + p0

h (p,q)i

q + p0

we shall demonstrate in section 5 that, in order to preserve 1/4 supersymmetry, f0 and
f12 must be related to r() as in eqs. (4.33) and (4.36). this result will clarify the nature
of our rst-order equation (4.28) .
[9], it can be
integrated exactly. in fact, by using the expression of d(p,q)() (eq. (4.19)), one can rewrite
eq. (4.28) as a total derivative:

an amazing aspect of eq. (4.28) is the fact that, as was noticed in ref.

the integration of eq. (4.37) is immediate and the result can be written as:

(r cos ) = r2

(p,q)

d

d h   
r sin  i .
  
r sin   z ,

d

r cos  = r2

(p,q)

(4.37)

(4.38)

where z is a constant of integration. notice that (4.38) determines r() in implicit form.
however, from eq. (4.38) one can easily obtain the explicit expression of r(). the result is:

r() = 

z
2 cos

2 cos  sz2

 + 4 r2

(p,q)

(4.39)

in gure 1 we have represented the d3-brane embedding for dierent values of the constants
 and z. in order to choose the signs on the right-hand side of (4.39) one has to take into
account that r() must be real and non-negative. notice that, in general, the function r()
is double-valued due to these two signs. this double-valueness can also be appreciated from
the plots of gure 1. in order to have a global description of the d3-brane world-volume by
means of a single-valued function, it is more convenient to work in a new set of variables
(z, ), related to (r, ) as follows:

z = r cos  ,

 = r sin  .

(4.40)

notice that z and  are nothing but cylindrical coordinates. clearly, z can take values on
the interval (, +), whereas 0   < . in these coordinates the embedding of the
d3-brane is determined by a single-valued function z().
the solution (4.38) of the bps dierential equation was analyzed in detail in ref. [9]. let
us review here the main results obtained in [9]. first of all, in those regions which are far
from the origin r = 0 (or    in cylindrical coordinates) the d3-brane world-volume can
be described approximately by the equation z = constant = z. thus, in these asymptotic
regions, the shape of the d3-brane world-volume is just a plane, i.e. the brane probe is not
bent by the action of the background. for some values of the integration constants the
shape of the d3-brane near the polar axis (i.e. for  = 0 or  = ) resembles that of a tube
(see gure 1). in this region, the d3-brane develops a world-volume soliton which is a spike
that connects the d3-brane probe to the r = 0 region, where the (p, q) ve-branes of the
background are located. in order to nd out what this soliton represents, let us evaluate
its energy. for this purpose it is more convenient to express the energy functional u in
cylindrical coordinates. by performing the change of variables (4.40) on the right-hand side
of eq. (4.22), one gets the remarkably simple result [9]:

u = 4 t3 z d s(cid:16) (p,q)  d(p,q)

dz

d (cid:17)2

+ (cid:16) d(p,q) + (p,q)

dz

d (cid:17)2

.

figure 1: solutions of the bps dierential equation for several values of  and z. the
coordinates (r, ) are the polar coordinates of the plane of the gure ( =  at the top).
the horizontal and vertical axis correspond, respectively, to the coordinates  and z. for
every value of , the dierent curves plotted together correspond to dierent values of the
constant z.

moreover, the bps condition in the (z, ) variables takes the form:

dz
d

= 

d(p,q)
(p,q)

.

(4.42)

notice that, when z() satises eq. (4.42), the second term under the square root on the
right-hand side of eq.
(4.41) vanishes. therefore, the energy of a bps conguration is
simply:

ubp s =  4 t3 z d h dz

d

+ (cid:16) dz

d (cid:17)1i d(p,q)

.

(4.43)

notice that the argument of the function d(p,q) in (4.43) is  =  arctan(/z). from
eq. (4.43) it is very easy to evaluate the contribution of the soliton to the energy u. indeed,
as the shape of the soliton is approximately a cylinder with  = constant, the derivative dz
d
. moreover, the
argument of the function d(p,q) is almost constant and equal to 0 or  and, therefore, d(p,q)
can be taken out of the integral. thus, for a tube at  = , the energy is given by:

is very large and, thus, one can neglect in (4.43) the term containing (cid:16) dz

d (cid:17)1

where ltube is the length of the tube dened as:

utube = 4 t3 | d(p,q)() | ltube ,

(4.44)

(4.45)

it is clear that the world-volume soliton we have found is one-dimensional, i.e. is a
string-like object. the best way to identify it is by computing its tension and comparing
the result with the strings of the type iib theory. this tension is naturally dened in the
string frame, where the metric gstring is related to the einstein metric g we have been using
as gstring = e/2 g. the world-volume action of any string has a nambu-goto term which

ltube = ztube

.

d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

dz

d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

14

contains the square root of the determinant of the induced metric. this nambu-goto term
is multiplied by a factor e/2 when one changes from the string frame to the einstein frame.
it is, thus, clear that this same factor, evaluated at innity, appears in the relation of the
string tensions in the two frames. actually, the tension in the string frame is obtained by
multiplying by g1/2
the tension evaluated in the einstein frame. taking these considerations
into account, we obtain from eq. (4.44) that the tension of our soliton in the string frame is:

s

 1
2

g

s 4 t3 | d(p,q)() | .

| d(p,q)() | =  ( 1   ) r2

(p,q) ,

the value of d(p,q) at  =  can be obtained in an straightforward way from eqs. (4.19) and
(4.14):

where, for reasons which will become clear in a moment, we have taken  in the interval
0    1. by using the value of r(p,q), as given in eq. (2.6), one gets that the tension of
the spike is:

(4.46)

(4.47)

(4.48)

(4.49)

(1  ) n tf h (p,q)

gs

i

2 .

recalling [12] that the tension of a (p, q) string is given by:

t(p,q) = vuut (p  q0)2 +

we conclude that the tension of our spike is:

q2
g2
s

tf = h (q,p)

gs

2 tf ,

(4.50)
which corresponds to a bundle constituted by (1  ) n parallel (q, p)-strings. it is now
clear that  should be quantized in units of 1/n and restricted to take values in the interval
[0, 1].

(1  ) n t(q,p) ,

the analysis we have done can also be carried out for world-volume solitons at  = 0. the
conclusion, in this case, is that the spike can be interpreted as a bundle of  n parallel (q, p)-
strings. therefore, the conguration we have found involves three branes, background, probe
and soliton, intersecting according to the array:
(p, q) ve  brane : 1 2 3 4 5

the world-volume solitons we have found provide an explicit realization of the hanany-
witten eect [23]. in order to clarify this point, let us consider, for concreteness, the  = 0
case. as can be seen from gure 1, when z  , the brane is nearly at. when z
is increased, the d3-brane gets more and more deformed near the  =  axis, and, when
z  + the bundle of (q, p)-strings is created. for  = 1 the soliton is created when
z   and the brane is not bent when z  +. notice that for  = 0, 1, the d3-brane
does not reach r = 0 and only in those two cases the d3-brane wraps completely the sphere
s3. if, on the contrary,  6= 0, 1, the r = 0 point is reached and the solution has the two
types of soliton tubes (at  = 0, ), depending on the sign of z.

15

5 supersymmetry

in this section we will show that the world-volume congurations we have found preserve 1/4
of the background supersymmetry. as is well-known [24, 25], the number of supersymmetries
preserved by a d3-brane moving in the background of a (p, q) ve-brane is the number of
independent solutions of the equation:

 (p,q) = (p,q) ,

(5.1)

where  is the matrix appearing in the -symmetry transformation of the d3-brane and (p,q)
is a killing spinor of the background. in general, the matrix  depends on the background
and on the type of brane. for a d3-brane in a type iib background,  is given by:

 =

where j (n) is the following matrix:

2 fnn j (n) ,

with 0 being:

j (n) = (1)n n

3 (i2)  0 ,

0 =

1
4!

14 14 .

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

notice that the presence of the e 
2 factors on the right-hand side of eq. (5.2) is due to the
fact that g is the induced metric in the einstein frame. moreover, in eqs. (5.2) and (5.4)
 are antisymmetrized products of the induced world-volume dirac matrices which, in
terms of the ten-dimensional constant gamma matrices m are given by:

 =  x m em

m m ,

(5.5)

where em

m is the ten-dimensional vielbein.

the innite sum appearing on the right-hand side of eq. (5.2) has, actually, only three
terms due to the antisymmetry of the index structure of this equation, and, thus,  can be
written as:

 =

16

in eq. (5.6), and in what follows, we have suppressed the tensor product symbol. for a
metric of the form (2.4), and if only the radial coordinate r is excited, the induced gamma
matrices take the form:

0 = [ h(p,q)(r) ] 1

8 0 ,

i = [ h(p,q)(r) ]

3

8 h r ei

i i + i r ri ,

(5.7)

where ei
matrix 0 can be written as:

i are the vielbeins on the sphere s3. moreover, when r only depends on 3  , the

0 = r2 h(p,q)(r) g [ r 3  rr ] 0r123 .

(5.8)

in agreement with our analysis of section 4, we shall assume from now on that the only
non-vanishing components of f are f0 and f12. if we dene:

f0 

e

[ h(p,q)(r) ]

f12 

e

r2 [ h(p,q)(r) ]

(5.9)

then, after using eqs. (5.6)-(5.8), we can write eq. (5.1) as:

0 ) (1 + f 2

q( r2 + r2  f 2
= i2h 3 ( r 0r + r0 )  f0 i h 3 12  f12 i (p,q) .

12 ) (p,q) =

(5.10)

we shall regard (5.10) as an equation whose unknowns are both the spinors (p,q) and
the world-volume eld strength f . in order to solve this equation we must know rst the
general form of the killing spinors of the (p, q) ve-brane background. these spinors can be
obtained from the supersymmetric variation of the gravitino and dilatino elds in the type
iib supergravity congurations of eqs. (2.4)-(2.11). in the coordinate system in which we
are working, and in the einstein frame, the (p,q)s can be written as follows [26]:

(p,q) =

1

[ h(p,q)(r) ]

e i

2 (p,q)(r) 2 e 3

2 3 r e 2

(5.11)

where 0 is a constant spinor of positive ten-dimensional chirality (11 0 = 0), satisfying
the condition:

0 12345 1 0 = 0 ,

(5.12)

with 12345 being the product of the -matrices along the parallel coordinates xi
k (i =
1,   , 5). we are taking the convention in which 11 = 0 12345 123 r, in agreement

17

with the array (4.51). the r-dependent angle (p,q)(r) is given by:

sin ((p,q)(r)) =

p [ h(p,q)(r) ]

h p2 h(p,q)(r) + g2

cos ((p,q)(r)) = 

gs ( q + p0)

h p2 h(p,q)(r) + g2

s ( q + p0)2i

.

2

(5.13)

notice that when (p, q) = (1, 0), (0, 1) and 0 = 0 (i.e. for the ns5- and d5-brane, re-
spectively), the angle dened by (5.13) is independent of r and, in those cases, the killing
spinors only depend on r through the power of the harmonic function in (5.11). in general,
the dependence of (p,q) on r will be given by the rst two terms on the right-hand side of
eq. (5.11) and will not be proportional to the unit matrix. as we will verify in a moment,
this fact will be crucial in our analysis. actually, by commuting the matrix appearing on
the left-hand side of eq. (5.12) with that of the right-hand side of (5.11), one can obtain the
following condition for (p,q):

0 12345 1 (p,q) = ei(p,q)(r) 2 (p,q) .

by using the fact that (p,q) has positive chirality, it is easy to prove that eq.
equivalent to:

0r (p,q) = (p,q)(r) 0123 (i2) (p,q) ,

(5.14)

(5.14) is

(5.15)

where (p,q)(r) is the following r-dependent linear combination of the pauli matrices 3 and
1:

(p,q)(r)  cos [(p,q)(r)] 3 + sin [(p,q)(r)] 1 .

(5.16)

in order to solve the supersymmetry preserving equation (5.10), we must impose some ad-
ditional constraint to the spinor (p,q). this extra condition is responsible of the fact that
our world-volume solitons preserve 1/4 supersymmetry, instead of the 1/2 supersymmetry
of the background. the extra requirement we shall demand to (p,q) is the one which follows
from the fact that we have a d3-brane placed on the (p, q) ve-brane background. this
supersymmetry condition associated to the d3-brane probe has to be imposed locally [10],
i.e. at a particular point of its world-volume. we shall choose this point to be the one with
polar coordinate 3 =  = 0. thus, we require that:

.

(5.17)

0123 (i2) (p,q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

= (p,q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

using this condition, it is a simple exercise to nd, by using eq. (5.11), the result of acting
with 0123(i2) on (p,q) at arbitrary angles:

0123 (i2) (p,q) = er (p,q) = (cos  + sin r ) (p,q) .

(5.18)

18

by using eq. (5.18) in eq. (5.15), one gets the result:

0r (p,q) = (p,q)(r) (cos  + sin r ) (p,q) ,

(5.19)
which corresponds to the supersymmetry breaking condition required to a (q, p)-string in
the radial direction at  = 0. in order to check this fact, one can verify for the ns5- and
d5-brane backgrounds that, indeed, eq. (5.19) implies that the radial spikes in these two
cases can be interpreted as a d1-brane and an antifundamental string respectively. as a
consequence of eqs. (5.18) and (5.19), one can obtain that:

0 (p,q) = (p,q)(r) ( sin  + cos r ) (p,q) ,

12 (p,q) = (i2) (p,q)(r) r (p,q) .

eqs. (5.19) and (5.20) allow us to evaluate the right-hand side of eq. (5.10). after performing
this evaluation, one gets two types of terms. first of all, one has terms which contain the
matrix r which should vanish. this condition leads to the equation:

3 (p,q)(r) ( r sin  ) f12  1 (p,q)(r) f0  i2 ( r cos  ) = 0 .

we have, in addition, terms without r, which give rise to the equation:

( r sin  ) + 1 (p,q)(r) ( r cos  )f12 + i2 f0 f12 =

(5.20)

(5.21)

(5.22)

= q( r2 + r2  f 2

0 ) (1 + f 2

12 ) .

eq. (5.21) can be used to determine f0 and f12. indeed, the left-hand side of this equation
contains terms proportional to the pauli matrix 2, together with others which are multiple
of the unit matrix. by requiring these two classes of terms to vanish independently, one gets
two equations which can be solved for f0 and f12 with the result:

f0 = cos[(p,q)(r)] ( r cos  ) ,

f12 = sin[(p,q)(r)]

( r cos  )
( r sin  ) .

(5.23)

quite remarkably, one can verify that the values of f0 and f12 given in eq. (5.23) also
satisfy eq.
(5.22) and, thus, we have succeeded to nd the world-volume eld strengths
corresponding to the d3-brane supersymmetry condition (5.17). it remains to verify that
the values we have just found are the same as those obtained in section 4 (eqs. (4.33) and
(4.36)), by means of the energy bound argument. the rst step in this verication will
consist in rewriting the values of sin[(p,q)(r)] and cos[(p,q)(r)] in terms of the dilaton eld
in the (p, q) ve-brane background. by combining eqs. (2.9) and (5.13), one arrives at:

sin[(p,q)(r)] = p e

by substituting these results on the right-hand side of eq. (5.23) and, after using the de-
nitions of f0 and f12 (eq. (5.9)), it is straightforward to check that the values of f0 and
f12 obtained from (5.23) coincide with the ones displayed in eqs. (4.33) and (4.36) (recall
that we are adopting the gauge (2.8) for the ns eld b). therefore, we conclude that the
bps conditions we have used to minimize the energy of the d3-brane probe are, indeed, the
ones needed to preserve 1/4 supersymmetry.

6 concluding remarks

in this paper we have studied the world-volume solitons of a d3-brane probe in the back-
ground of a stack of parallel (p, q) ve-branes. we have used s-duality to nd an energy
bound, whose saturation is achieved when a certain rst-order bps equation is satised.
by solving this bps equation we have determined the d3-brane embeddings in the (p, q)
ve-brane geometry. the resulting congurations of the brane probe contain spikes, which
can be interpreted as a bundle of (q, p) strings emanating from the d3-brane world-volume.
an important point in our analysis is the role played by the background which, through
its coupling to the d3-brane in the wz term of the action sw z, provides a source for
the world-volume gauge eld. for the background we studied two dierent terms in sw z
are relevant. moreover, we have veried that the congurations which saturate the energy
bound are precisely those which are 1/4 supersymmetric. this result is very important since
it provides a precise interpretation of the bps equation obtained by the energy argument.
it is clear that the ansatz we have adopted to minimize the energy is not the most
general one. we could take, for example, a radial deformation of the brane probe with less
symmetry than the so(3) invariant one we have considered here. in these new congurations
the coordinate r would depend on the three angles i and, in principle, one could apply the
methods of ref.
[10] to study them. the resulting bps equation for this case would be
more complicated although, from the results of [10], one expects to nd at least some of its
particular solutions.

it would be also very interesting to apply the methodology followed here to other back-
in particular we could apply dierent chains of dualities (including
ground and probes.
t-duality, which was not used here) to generate new world-volume solitons from the known
ones.
