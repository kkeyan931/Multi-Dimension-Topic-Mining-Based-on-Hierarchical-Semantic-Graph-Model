abstract

we propose a procedure for computing the boundary stress tensor associ-
ated with a gravitating system in asymptotically anti-de sitter space. our def-
inition is free of ambiguities encountered by previous attempts, and correctly
reproduces the masses and angular momenta of various spacetimes. via the
ads/cft correspondence, our classical result is interpretable as the expecta-
tion value of the stress tensor in a quantum conformal eld theory. we demon-
strate that the conformal anomalies in two and four dimensions are recovered.
the two dimensional stress tensor transforms with a schwarzian derivative and
the expected central charge. we also nd a nonzero ground state energy for
global ads5, and show that it exactly matches the casimir energy of the dual
n = 4 super yang-mills theory on s3  r.

1 introduction

in a generally covariant theory it is unnatural to assign a local energy-momentum
density to the gravitational eld. for instance, candidate expressions depending only
on the metric and its rst derivatives will always vanish at a given point in locally at
coordinates. instead, we can consider a so-called quasilocal stress tensor, dened

locally on the boundary of a given spacetime region. consider the gravitational action
thought of as a functional of the boundary metric . the quasilocal stress tensor
associated with a spacetime region has been dened by brown and york to be [1]:

t  =

2



sgrav


(1)

the resulting stress tensor typically diverges as the boundary is taken to innity.
however, one is always free to add a boundary term to the action without disturbing
the bulk equations of motion. to obtain a nite stress tensor, brown and york
propose a subtraction derived by embedding a boundary with the same intrinsic
metric  in some reference spacetime, such as at space. this prescription suers
from an important drawback: it is not possible to embed a boundary with an arbitrary
intrinsic metric in the reference spacetime. therefore, the brown-york procedure is
generally not well dened.

for asymptotically anti-de sitter (ads) spacetimes, there is an attractive resolu-
tion to this diculty. a duality has been proposed which equates the gravitational
action of the bulk viewed as a functional of boundary data, with the quantum eec-
tive action of a conformal eld theory (cft) dened on the ads boundary [2, 3, 4].
according to this correspondence, (1) can be interpreted as giving the expectation
value of the stress tensor in the cft:1

ht i =

2



se


.

(2)

the divergences which appear as the boundary is moved to innity are then simply
the standard ultraviolet divergences of quantum eld theory, and may be removed
by adding local counterterms to the action. these subtractions depend only on the
intrinsic geometry of the boundary and are dened once and for all, in contrast to the
ambiguous prescription involving embedding the boundary in a reference spacetime.
this interpretation of divergences was rst discussed in [4], and has been applied to
various computations in, e.g., [8, 9, 10, 11].

inspired by the proposed correspondence, we develop a new procedure for dening
the stress tensor of asymptotically locally anti-de sitter spacetimes. we renormalize
the stress-energy of gravity by adding a nite series in boundary curvature invariants
to the action. the required terms are xed essentially uniquely by requiring niteness
of the stress tensor. we then show that we correctly reproduce the masses and angular
momenta of various asymptotically ads spacetimes see, e.g., [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
for previous studies of energy in ads

1see [5, 6, 9, 7] for some interesting examples.

according to (2), our denition should also exhibit the properties of a stress ten-
sor in a quantum cft. the boundary stress tensor of ads3 is expected to transform
under dieomorphisms as a tensor plus a schwarzian derivative. we verify this trans-
formation rule, and so derive the existence of a virasoro algebra with central charge
c = 3/2g, in agreement with the result of brown and henneaux [18]. we also
demonstrate that the stress tensor acquires the correct trace anomaly t 
24r.
the candidate dual to ads5 gravity is four-dimensional n = 4 super yang-mills
theory. our procedure for computing the spacetime stress tensor (1) reproduces the
expected trace anomaly of the gauge theory. an interesting  and at rst surprising
 feature of our stress tensor is that it is generally non-vanishing even when the
bulk geometry is exactly ads. in particular, global ads5, with an s3  r boundary,
has a positive mass. in contrast, the reference spacetime approach, by construction,
gives pure ads a vanishing mass. our result is beautifully explained via the proposed
duality with a boundary cft. the dual super yang-mills theory on a sphere has a
casimir energy that precisely matches our computed spacetime mass.

 =  c

we conclude by discussing prospects for dening an analogous quasilocal stress

tensor in asymptotically at spacetimes.

2 dening the stress tensor

brown and yorks denition of the quasilocal stress tensor is motivated by hamilton-
jacobi theory [1]. the energy of a point particle is the variation of the action with
respect to time: e = s/t. in gravity, lengths are measured by the metric, so
time is naturally replaced by the boundary metric , yielding a full stress tensor
t :

t  =

(3)

here s = sgrav() is the gravitational action viewed as a functional of . of
course, this is also the standard formula for the stress tensor of a eld theory with
action s dened on a surface with metric .

the gravitational action with cosmological constant  = d(d  1)/22 is:

the second term is required for a well dened variational principle (see, e.g., [19]),
and sct is the counterterm action that we will add in order to obtain a nite stress
tensor.  is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary, and is dened below.
consider foliating the d + 1 dimensional spacetime m by a series of d dimensional
timelike surfaces homeomorphic to the boundary m. we let x be coordinates span-

3

ning a given timelike surface, and let r be the remaining coordinate. it is convenient
to write the spacetime metric in an adm-like decomposition [19]:

ds2 = n 2dr2 + (dx + n dr)(dx + n dr).

(5)

here  is a function of all the coordinates, including r. we will refer to the surface
at xed r as the boundary mr to the interior region mr. the metric on mr is
 evaluated at the boundary value of r. in ads, the boundary metric acquires an
innite weyl factor as we take r to innity. so we will more properly think of the
ads boundary as a conformal class of boundaries (see, e.g., [4]).

to compute the quasilocal stress tensor for the region mr we need to know the
variation of the gravitational action with respect to the boundary metric .2
in
general, varying the action produces a bulk term proportional to the equations of
motion plus a boundary term. since we will always consider solutions to the equations
of motion, only the boundary term contributes:

where n is the outward pointing normal vector to the boundary mr. the quasilocal
stress tensor is thus

(9)

sct must be chosen to cancel divergences that arise as mr tends to the ads boundary
m.
in this limit we expect to reproduce standard computations of the mass of
asymptotically ads spacetimes [12, 15, 13, 16, 17]. brown and york propose to
embed mr in a pure ads background and to let sct be the action of the resulting
spacetime region. a similar reference spacetime approach is taken by the authors
of [15, 16, 17]. however, as noted by all these authors, it is not always possible to nd
such an embedding, and so the prescription is not generally well-dened. a reference
spacetime is also implicitly present in the treatment of abbott and deser [12] which

constructs a noether current for uctuations around pure ads. finally, ashtekar and
magnon [13] exploit the conformal structure of asymptotically ads spaces to directly
compute nite conserved charges. it would be interesting to understand the relation
of our work to their approach.

we propose an alternative procedure: take sct to be a local functional of the
intrinsic geometry of the boundary, chosen to cancel the mr  m divergences in
(9). here we set sct = rmr lct, and state our results for ads3, ads4, and ads5:

as we will see, the terms appearing in sct are xed essentially uniquely by requiring
cancellation of divergences. the number of counterterms required grows with the
dimension of ads space. in general, we are also free to add terms of higher mass
dimension to the counterterm action for adsd+1. but when d is odd, dimensional
analysis shows that these terms make no contribution to t  as the boundary is
taken to innity. for d even there is one potential ambiguity which we will explain
and exorcise in later sections. the addition of sct does not aect the bulk equations
of motion or the gibbons-hawking black hole entropy calculations because the new
terms are intrinsic invariants of the boundary.

after adding the counterterms (10), the stress tensor (9) has a well dened limit
as mr  m.
(more precisely, dimensional analysis determines the scaling of
the stress tensor with the diverging weyl factor of the boundary metric. however,
observables like mass and angular momentum will be r independent.) to assign a
mass to an asymptotically ads geometry, choose a spacelike surface  in m with
metric ab, and write the boundary metric in adm form:

dxdx = n 2

 dt2 + ab(dxa + n a

dt)(dxb + n b

dt).

(11)

then let u be the timelike unit normal to . u denes the local ow of time in
m. if  is a killing vector generating an isometry of the boundary geometry, there
should be an associated conserved charge. following brown and york [1], this charge
is:

(12)

dd1x (u t )

q = z

5

the conserved charge associated with time translation is then the mass of spacetime.
alternatively, we can dene a proper energy density

to convert to mass, multiply by the lapse n appearing in (11) and integrate:

 = uut.

dd1x n .

m = z

(13)

(14)

this denition of mass coincides with the conserved quantity in (12) when the timelike
killing vector is  = n u. similarly, we can dene a momentum

where

dd1x ja,

pa = z

ja = abut a.

(15)

(16)

when a is an angular direction, pa is the corresponding angular momentum.

although we have only written the gravitational action in (4), our formulae are
equally valid in the presence of matter. in particular, (14) and (15) give the total
mass and momentum of the entire matter plus gravity system.

3 ads3

we begin with the relatively simple case of ads3. we will show that our prescription
correctly computes the mass and angular momentum of btz black holes, and repro-
duces the transformation law and conformal anomaly of the stress tensor in the dual
cft.

the poincare patch of ads3 can be written as:3

ds2 =

2
r2 dr2 +

r2
2 (dt2 + dx2).

(17)

a boundary at xed r is conformal to r1,1: tt = xx = r2/2. the normal vector
to surfaces of constant r is

3see, e.g., [21] for the embedding of the poincare patch in global ads3.

neglecting sct, one would obtain divergent results for physical observables such as
the mass

m = z dxgxx n utut ttt = z dx ttt  r2  .

(20)

so ttt must be independent of r for large r in order for the spacetime to have a nite
mass density.

sct is dened essentially uniquely by the requirement that it be a local, covariant
function of the intrinsic geometry of the boundary. it is readily shown that the only

such term that can cancel the divergence in (20) is sct = (1/)r . this then

yields t = 0, which is clearly free of divergences. in general, we could have added
further higher dimensional counterterms such as r and r2. dimensional analysis
shows that terms higher than r vanish too rapidly at innity to contribute to the
stress tensor. the potential contribution from the metric variation of r is g,
the einstein tensor, which vanishes identically in two dimensions. so the minimal
counterterm in (10) completely denes the ads3 stress tensor.

since the stress tensor is now fully specied, it must reproduce the mass and
angular momentum of a known solution. to check this, we study spacetimes of the
form:

ds2 =

2
r2 dr2 +

r2
2 (dt2 + dx2) + gm n dxm dxn .

inserting these into (23) with x   and r dx  r 2

m = m and p = j in agreement with conventional techniques. when m = 1/8g
and j = 0, the btz metric reproduces global ads3, while the m = 0, j = 0 black
hole looks like poincare ads3 (17) with an identication of the boundary. it may
seem surprising that global ads3 apparently diers in mass from the poincare patch.
the dierence arises because the time directions of these coordinates do not agree,
giving rise to dierent denitions of energy.

(26)

3.1 conformal symmetry of ads3

brown and henneaux [18] have shown that gravity in asymptotically ads3 spacetime
is a conformal eld theory with central charge c = 3/2g. both as a check of our
approach, and because our covariant method will oer an alternative to the hamilto-
nian formalism adopted in [18] and the chern-simons methods of [22], we would like
to reproduce this result.4

in light of the ads/cft correspondence, we can think of the conformal symmetry
group as arising from a 1+1 dimensional non-gravitational quantum eld theory living
(loosely speaking) on the boundary of ads3. on a plane with metric ds2 = dx+dx,
dieomorphisms of the form

x+  x+  +(x+),

x  x  (x)

transform the stress tensor as:

t++  t++ + (2++ t++ + + +t++) 
t  t + (2 t +  t)

(27)

(28)

the terms in parenthesis are just the classical tensor transformation rules, while the
last term is a quantum eect. let us briey recall the origin of the latter. although
(27) is classically a symmetry of the cft, it is quantum mechanically anomalous
since we must specify a renormalization scale . to obtain a symmetry under (27),
 must also be rescaled to have the same measured value in the new coordinates
as in the original coordinates. equivalently, the metric should be weyl rescaled to
preserve the form ds2 = dx+dx. such a rescaling of lengths acts non-trivially in
the quantum theory and produces the extra terms in (28).

4related work has been done by hyun et.al. [9]

8

we will focus on obtaining the nal terms in (28) by starting from ads3 in the

form

ds2 =

2
r2 dr2  r2dx+dx,

(29)

for which t = 0. we think of the dual cft as living on the surface ds2 =
r2dx+dx with r eventually taken to innity. now consider the dieomorphism
(27). as above, this is not a symmetry since it introduces a weyl factor into the
boundary metric. to obtain a symmetry one must leave the asymptotic form of the
metric invariant, and the precise conditions for doing so have been given by brown
and henneaux [18]:

r2

g+ =

r2 + o(

g++ = o(1),

g+r = o(

g = o(1),

the dieomorphisms which respect these conditions are:

(31)

for large r, the corrections to the x transformations are subleading, and we recover

(34)

thus we have veried the result of brown and henneaux [18].

in the cft the full transformation law arose from doing a renormalization group
rescaling of , while on the gravity side it arose from a dieomorphism which rescaled
the radial position of the boundary. this ts very nicely with the general feature of
the ads/cft correspondence that scale size in the cft is dual to the radial position
in ads. according to [23], r species an eective uv cuto in the cft; by rescaling

9

r before taking it to innity we are changing the way in which the cuto is removed
 but this is just the denition of a renormalization group transformation.

we restricted attention to the dieomorphism (31) because we were interested in
symmetries which preserved the form of the boundary metric. more general dieo-
morphisms may be studied, but these will modify the form of the cft and so are
not symmetries.

3.2 conformal anomaly for ads3

the stress tensor of a 1 + 1 dimensional cft has a trace anomaly

t 
 = 

c

24

r

(35)

we will now verify that our quasilocal stress tensor has a trace of precisely this form.
the mechanism for obtaining a conformal anomaly from the ads/cft correspon-
dence was outlined by witten [4] and studied in detail by henningson and skenderis
[8]. our approach is somewhat dierent from that of [8].

taking the trace of the ads3 stress tensor appearing in (10) we nd

t 
 = 

1

8g

( + 2/).

(36)

(36) gives the trace in terms of the extrinsic curvature; to compare with (35) we need
to express the result in terms of the intrinsic curvature of the boundary.

since (36) is manifestly covariant, we may compute the right hand side in any

convenient coordinate system. we write

ds2 =

2
r2 dr2 + dxdx

the extrinsic curvature in these coordinates is

 = 
so in this coordinate system (36) becomes

show [24] that only even powers appear and that the leading term goes as r2 . so we
write

(40)

there are additional higher powers of 1/r as well as logarithmic terms [24], but these
will not be needed. we now have

solving einsteins equations perturbatively gives [8]

trh((0))1(2)i =

where r is the curvature of the metric . finally, inserting this into (41) and taking
r to innity we obtain

the only dierence between the ads4 and ads3 stress tensor derivations is the need
for an extra term in sct to cancel divergences. again, start with ads4 in poincare
form:

ds2 =

it is easy to show that the mass is still given by (45) in the limit r  , after
replacing d2x by sin  d d. we nd that the counterterm introduced above correctly
removes the r2 divergence in t, but there remains a r0 behaviour (leading to a

divergent mass which can be cancelled by adding r r/2 to sct. altogether, this

gives the counterterm action written in (10). we are free to add higher dimensional
objects like r2 to sct, but they vanish too quickly at the ads4 boundary to contribute
to the stress tensor. in total, the stress tensor for the metric (47) is:

4.1 conformal anomaly for ads4

direct computation shows that the stress tensor for ads4 is traceless. there is also
a general argument that the trace vanishes for any even dimensional ads, which we
give instead.

the stress tensor for adsd+1 has length dimension d. since for large r the weyl
factor multiplying the boundary metric is proportional to r2, it must be the case that

t 
 

1
rd .

working in coordinates like (37), the trace has the structure

t 
  rr + (curvature invariants of ).

now,  has an expansion in even powers of r [24]:

 = r2

r2n .



xn=0

12

(52)

(53)

(54)

using this in (53), and the fact that scalar curvature invariants always involve even
powers of the metric, we nd that only even powers of r can appear in the trace.
comparing with (52), shows that the stress tensor must vanish for odd d.

this result is expected from the ads/cft correspondence, since even dimensional
ads bulk theories are dual to odd dimensional cfts, which have a vanishing trace
anomaly.

5 ads5

the ads5 counterterms are derived in parallel with ads4, so we can be brief. the
expression for the spacetime mass is now:

m = z d3xgxx n utut ttt = z d3x

r2
2 ttt.

(55)

a nite mass density therefore requires ttt  r2 for large r. upon evaluating the
stress tensor in poincare and global coordinates and imposing niteness, we arrive at
the counterterms written in (10). by dimensional analysis, the only possible higher
dimensional terms in sct that could make a nite contribution to the stress tensor
are the squares of the riemann tensor, the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar of the
boundary metric. we will discuss these potential ambiguities in sec. 5.1.

we now check our denition against the known mass of particular solutions. con-

pure global ads5 when r0 = 0. it seems unusual from the gravitational point of view
to have a mass for a solution that is a natural vacuum, but we will show that this is
precisely correct from the perspective of the ads/cft correspondence.

casimir energy5

string theory on ads5  s5 is expected to be dual to four dimensional n = 4,
su(n) super yang-mills [2]. we use the conversion formula to gauge theory variables:

then, setting r0 = 0, the mass of global ads5 is:

the yang-mills dual of ads5 is dened on the global ads5 boundary with topology
s3  r. a quantum eld theory on suc a manifold can have a nonvanishing vacuum
energy  the casimir eect. in the free eld limit, the casimir energy on s3  r is:6

where n0 is the number of real scalars, n1/2 is the number of weyl fermions, n1 is
the number of gauge bosons, and r is the radius of s3. for su(n), n = 4 super
yang-mills n0 = 6(n 2  1), n1/2 = 4(n 2  1) and n1 = n 2  1 giving:

ecasimir =

5we thank gary horowitz for pointing out the relevance of the cft casimir energy to our result,

and fo discussing his related work with hirosi ooguri.

6noting that s 3  r is the einstein static universe, we can adopt the results of [25].

14

to compare with (63), remember that m is measured with respect to coordinate time
while the casimir energy is dened with respect to proper boundary time. converting

to coordinate time by multiplying by gtt = r/ gives the casimir mass:

mcasimir =

3(n 2  1)

16

.

(66)

in the large n limit we nd precise agreement with the gravitational mass (63) of
global ads5.

in related work, horowitz and myers [17] compared the mass of an analytically
continued non-extremal d3-brane solution to the corresponding free-eld casimir
energy in the gauge theory, and found agreement up to an overall factor of 3/4.
they argued that the mathematical origin of the discrepancy was the same as for
a 3/4 factor relating the gravitational entropy of the system to a free eld entropy
computation in the cft dual. in both cases, the gravitational result is valid at strong
gauge coupling and, apparently, the extrapolation from the free limit of the gauge
theory involves a factor of 3/4.

in our case, however, the coecients match precisely. in general, gravity calcu-
lations may not be extrapolated to the weakly coupled gauge theory, because large
string theoretic corrections can deform the bulk geometry in this regime. this is the
origin of the 3/4 factor discussed above. in our case, pure ads5 is protected from
stringy corrections because all tensors which might modify einsteins equation actu-
ally vanish when evaluated in this background [26]. this is why the casimir energy
in the weakly coupled, large n yang-mills exactly matches the gravitational mass of
spacetime.

the ads5 conformal anomaly computation is a more laborious version of the ads3
result in sec. 3.2. the trace of the ads5 stress tensor in (10) is

t

(3 + 12/  r/2).

this result for the trace agrees with the work of henningson and skenderis [8]. these
authors also show that upon using (62), precise agreement is obtained with the con-
formal anomaly of n = 4 super yang-mills.

an ambiguity

the minimal ads5 counterterm action in (10) can be augmented by the addition of
terms quadratic in the riemann tensor, ricci tensor and ricci scalar of the boundary
metric.7 a convenient basis for this ambiguity is provided by:

sct = 3zmr

d4xha e + b cc  + c r2i .

(73)

the rst term is the euler invariant e = rr  4rr + r2 and vanishes
under variation, so we can omit it without loss of generality. c  is the weyl tensor.
varying sct with respect to the boundary metric produces an ambiguity in the stress
tensor:

t =   3

16g! (b h b

 + c h c

).

(74)

the tensors h b and h c are computed in [25]; their trace gives a contribution to the
anomaly

t 

  r.

(75)

for general boundary metrics there is therefore a two parameter set of possible stress
tensors, whose anomalies have varying coecients for r. exactly the same ambi-
guity is present in the denition of the renormalized stress tensor of the dual eld

7higher dimensional invariants give a vanishing contribution to the stress tensor at the ads

boundary.

theory on the curved boundary [25]. our gravitational result can only be matched
to eld theory computations after the ambiguous parameters are matched. for con-
formally at boundaries the tensor h b
 vanishes leaving a one parameter ambiguity,
which is fully specied by the coecient of r in the anomaly. so we learn from (72)
that gravitational energies computed with the minimal counterterm action sct = 0
should be compared with a eld theory regularization which produces a vanishing
r anomaly coecient. precisely this was done in the above comparison of casimir
energies for global ads5. the boundary s3  r is conformally at, and we have
checked that the eld theory computation that produces (64) yields no r term
in the anomaly. this explains the agreement between the gravity and eld theory
results, despite the apparent ambiguity in choosing sct

6 discussion

we have formulated a stress tensor which gives a well-dened meaning to the notions
of energy and momentum in ads. through the ads/cft correspondence, we have
also found results for the expectation value of the stress tensor in the dual cft. our
proposal exhibits the desired features of a stress tensor, both from the gravitational
and cft points of view.

the procedure we have followed for dening the stress tensor is a particular exam-
ple of the ideas developed in [27]. there it was shown how to associate the asymptotic
behavior of each bulk eld with the expectation value of a cft operator. the rela-
tion studied here between the gravitational eld and the stress tensor is an example
of this correspondence.

it would be desirable to formulate an analogous stress tensor in asymptotically
at spacetimes. it is not immediately clear how to dene counterterms, since there
is no longer a dimensionful parameter like  allowing one to form a dimensionless
counterterm action. on the other hand, at spacetime is recovered from ads by
taking   , so we might expect that applying this limit to our formulae would
yield the appropriate stress tensor. however, the situation is complicated by the fact
that we must keep r nite while applying the limit, taking r   afterwards. the
stress tensor at nite r should be interpreted in a cft with an ultraviolet cuto [23].
this implies that the limits   , r   can be understood in renormalization
group terms [28].
