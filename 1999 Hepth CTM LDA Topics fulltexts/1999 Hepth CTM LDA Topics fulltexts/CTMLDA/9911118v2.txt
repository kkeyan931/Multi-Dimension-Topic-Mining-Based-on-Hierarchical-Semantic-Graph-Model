abstract

in this paper we lay the foundations of causal quantum gravity, i.e. of a
quantum theory of self-interacting symmetric massless rank-2 tensor gauge
elds, the gravitons, on at space-time, in the framework of causal per-
turbation theory. the causal inductive construction of the s-matrix for
quantum gravity leads to a very satisfactory treatment of the ultraviolet
problem. here we concentrate on some main fundamental issues that con-
cern the quantization of the gravitational interactions: the quantization of
the free graviton eld, the role of the fermionic ghost vector elds in pre-
serving perturbative gauge invariance, the construction of the fock space
for the graviton and the consequent characterization of the subspace for
the physical graviton states. this last point is necessary, together with
perturbative gauge invariance, in order to prove unitarity of the s-matrix
restricted to the physical subspace.

introduction

the central aspect of this work is the understanding of some fundamental prob-
lems that arise in the quantization process of a rank-2 tensor eld and in the
perturbative construction of the scattering matrix for the corresponding quan-
tum eld theory: quantum gravity (qg), by which we mean a quantum eld
theory of self-interacting massless rank-2 symmetric tensor gauge elds on at
minkowski background metric.

a review of such a broad subject, with all the implications that it involves,
cannot be the theme of a short introduction, we therefore refer to much more
complete works: [1], [2].

one of the possible derivation of einsteins theory of gravitation is the eld-
theoretic, non-geometrical route which essentially identies massless spin-2 elds
with carriers of the gravitational interaction. numerous papers discuss this
approach: [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7] and references therein.

for the implementation of this approach on a quantum level, namely the
implementation of quantum gravity as a poincare covariant local quantum eld
theory with a considerable gauge arbitrariness, two methods will be used: the
epsteinglaser inductive construction of the s-matrix perturbation series [8]
and the concept of perturbative quantum operator gauge invariance, borrowed
from the case of non-abelian gauge theories [9].

the rst method provides an elegant and ecacious way of dealing with the
ultraviolet problem of quantum gravity taking causality as cornerstone in the
construction of the s-matrix. although in this paper we will not concentrate
on this aspect (loop calculations will be the subject of a forthcoming work), a
short introduction to the causal epsteinglaser method is given.

the second method formulates perturbative gauge invariance by means of a
gauge charge q which requires the introduction of the ghost-graviton coupling
and allows us to construct explicitely the fock space of physical graviton states.
this is a very important issue because a rank-2 tensor eld has more independent
degrees of freedom than a massless spin-2 particle. in addition, we are able to
prove perturbative unitarity of the s-matrix on the physical subspace.

a dierent formulation of the graviton quantization can be found in [10],
whereas results obtained in causal quantum gravity by the author are reviewed
in [11].

the paper is organized as follow: in the next section we briey introduce the
causal method in s-matrix perturbation theory, in sec. 3 we derive from classical
general relativity the inputs that are needed for the causal construction of the
s-matrix for qg, only in this section we resort to classical general relativity.
in sec. 4 we introduce the concept of perturbative quantum operator gauge
invariance. in sec. 5 we discuss classical and quantized tensor elds and give an
explicit representation for the latter which enables us to construct the graviton
fock space f. the explicit construction of the physical subspace fphys  f
is carried out in sec. 6 after quantization of the ghost and anti-ghost elds.

3

the analysis of the krein conjugation on f, in sec. 7, entails pseudo-unitarity
instead of unitarity. but unitarity can be restored, in sec. 8, between graviton
states under poincare transformations and in sec. 9 for the s-matrix, although
for its restriction on the physical subspace.

we use the unit convention:  = c = 1, greek indices , , . . . run from 0 to

3, whereas latin indices i, j, . . . run from 1 to 3.

2 s-matrix causal perturbation theory

since in this paper the causal method [8] is not used in its full strength, but it
serves only as a motivation and starting point for further investigations, we give
only a concise review of the causal approach to qft, for a detailed exposition,
see [12], [13].

we consider the s-matrix, being a formal power series in the coupling con-
stant, as a sum of smeared operator-valued distributions of the following form:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

1

n!z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn) g(x1)  . . .  g(xn) ,

(2.1)

where g is a schwartz test function (g  s(r4)) which switches adiabatically
the interaction and provides a natural infrared cuto in the long-range part of
the interaction.

the s-matrix maps the asymptotically incoming free elds on the outgoing
ones and it is possible to express it by means of free elds. interacting quantum
elds are not used in the causal approach.

the n-point operator-valued distribution tn is a well-dened renormalized
time-ordered product expressed in terms of wick monomials of free elds. tn
is constructed inductively from the rst order t1(x), which corresponds to the
usual interaction lagrangian in terms of free elds, and from the lower orders
tj, j = 2, . . . , n  1 by means of poincare covariance and causality.
causality, if correctly incorporated, leads directly to the renormalized per-
turbation series for the s-matrix which is ultraviolet (uv) nite and cuto-free
in every order.

the construction of tn requires some care:

if it were simply given by the

usual time-ordering

tn(x1, . . . , xn) = t{t1(x1) . . . t1(xn)}

= xn

(x0

(1)  x0

(2)) . . . (x0

(n1)  x0

(n)) 

(2.2)

 t1(x(1)) . . . t1(x(n)) ,

then uv-divergences would appear.

for the causal inductive construction, the equations of motion of the free
quantum elds are needed together with their commutation rules expressed by

4

the causal jordan-pauli distribution dm(x) = d(+)
mass m.

m (x) + d()

m (x) for a eld with

then, an auxiliary distribution dn(x1, . . . , xn) is constructed with the help
of t1, . . . , tn1 by carrying out all the possible contractions between eld opera-
tors appearing in t1, . . . , tn1 using wicks lemma, so that dn has the following
form

dn(x1, . . . , xn) = r

n(x1, . . . , xn)  a

n(x1, . . . , xn)

=xk

:ok(x1, . . . , xn) : d[k]

n (x1  xn, . . . , xn1  xn) ,

(2.3)

where :ok(x1, . . . , xn) : represents a normally ordered product of free eld oper-
ators and d[k]
n (x1  xn, . . . , xn1  xn) is a c-number distribution that contains
well-dened products of positive and negative frequency parts of dm(xj  xn)
with j = 1, . . . , n  1. because of translation invariance, d[k]
n depends only on
relative coordinates with respect to xn; eq. (2.3) contains tree, loop and vacuum
contributions.

the most important property of dn is causality:

supp(cid:0)dn(x1, . . . , xn)(cid:1)  +

n1(xn)  

n1(xn) ,

(2.4)

where


n1(xn) = {(x1, . . . , xn)  r4n | xj  (xn + v ), j = 1, . . . , n  1} .

(2.5)

only the numerical distributions are responsible for the support properties. in
order to obtain tn(x1, . . . , xn) we have to split correctly the dn-distribution
into a retarded part, rn, and an advanced part, an, with

supp(cid:0)rn(x1, . . . , xn)(cid:1)  +

n1(xn)

and supp(cid:0)an(x1, . . . , xn)(cid:1)  

n1(xn) .

this operation aects only the numerical distributions d[k]
critical point for the splitting lies in the coincidence point

n and obviously the

+
n1(xn)  

n1(xn) = n = {x1 = x2 = . . . = xn} .

(2.6)

the correct treatment of this point constitutes the key to control the uv-
behaviour of the n-point distribution. indeed, the origin of the uv-divergences
lies in products of feynman propagators with coincident arguments in loop
graphs, because time-ordering cannot be done simply by multiplying (singu-
lar) distributions by discontinuous -distributions, as in eq. (2.2), a procedure
which is usually ill-dened, but if it is carefully done by rst multiplying with a
c-function and then performing the limit to step function, then the expression
for tn remains well-dened and nite.

the measure of the behaviour of the numerical distribution d[k]

n near this

point is encoded in the number (d[k]

n ) called singular order.

5

the splitting of the numerical distribution d[k]
n must therefore be accom-
plished according to the correct singular order (d[k]
2 ), otherwise uv-divergences
would appear. if  < 0, then the splitting is trivial and agrees with the standard
time-ordering and we recover the feynman rules. on the other side, if   0,
then the splitting is non-trivial and non-unique. for a general retarded part we
obtain:

d[k]
n (x1  xn, . . . , xn1  xn)  r[k]

n (x1  xn, . . . , xn1  xn) +

+

(dn)

x|a|=0

ca,[k] da (4(n1))(x1  xn, . . . , xn1  xn) ,

(2.7)

where a special retarded part r[k]
obtained in momentum space from d[k]

n , the so-called central splitting solution, is

n by means of a dispersion integral:

r[k]
n (p) =

i

2z 



dt

d[k]
n (tp)

(t  i0)+1 (1  t + i0)

,

p = (p1, . . . , pn1), pj  v + .

(2.8)

eq. (2.7) contains a local ambiguity in the normalization: the ca,[k]s are unde-
termined nite normalization constants, which multiply terms with local sup-
port. this freedom in the normalization has to be restricted by further physical
conditions, e.g. lorentz covariance, pseudo-unitarity (see sec. 9), existence of
the adiabatic limit g  1 and gauge invariance (see sec. 4.2).

finally, tn is given by

tn(x1, . . . , xn) + nn(x1, . . . , xn) = rn(x1, . . . , xn)  r

n(x1, . . . , xn)

:ok(x1, . . . , xn) : t[k]

n (x1  xn, . . . , xn1  xn) +

=xk
:ok(x1, . . . , xn) : n 
x|a|=0

+xk

ca,[k] da (4(n1))(x1  xn, . . . , xn1  xn)o ,

(2.9)

in which we articially separate local from non-local contributions for later use.
most of the s-matrix properties are indeed translated into conditions that
the tns and the nns must satisfy, for example gauge invariance and unitarity.
the advantages of the causal scheme are that it leads directly to a renor-
malized perturbative expansion for the s-matrix without using a cuto.
it
makes possible, to a given order in the coupling constant, to compute uv nite
amplitudes for all processes and it does not rely on the lagrangian approach
with interacting quantum elds.

6

3 from general relativity to quantum gravity

the causal inductive construction of the n-point operator valued distributions
tn that appear in the expansion of the s-matrix can be accomplished provided
some basic assumptions about the free elds and their couplings are made.
for qg in the causal framework, we need the equation of motion of the free
graviton eld in a xed gauge, the commutation rule between two graviton elds
at dierent space-time points and the rst order graviton coupling.

3.1 classical general relativity in lagrangian form

since we are interested in a quantum theory of einsteins general relativity, we
start by considering the hilberteinstein lagrangian density (without cosmo-
logical constant)

lhe = 2

2

gr ,

with the notation:

r = r

g (g, + g,  g,) ,



 

  



 ,

r = g r ,

(3.1)

(3.2)

and 2 = 32g, where g is the newtons constant. the variation of the source-
free hilberteinstein action

ahe = 2

2 z d4xg r ,

(3.3)

with respect to the metric tensor g leads to the vacuum einstein eld equations

g := r 

1
2

g r = 0 .

we rewrite lhe in term of the goldberg variable
g := g g ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

and, disregarding divergence terms that can be integrated away, we obtain

lhe =

1

22(cid:20)+g gg

2

g gg  2g 

 

(cid:21) g

, g
, ,

(3.6)

where  = diag(1,1,1,1) is the at space-time metric tensor.
through the expansion of the goldberg variable

after having dened the symmetric tensor eld h (x), the graviton eld,

g (x) =  +  h (x) ,

(3.7)

7

in the at geometry, we insert (3.7) into (3.6) and obtain a non-terminating
expansion of the hilberteinstein lagrangian density

lhe =



xj=0

j l(j)
he ,

(3.8)

where l(j)

he represents an interaction involving j + 2 gravitons.

3.2 linearized free theory

for convenience of notation, the trace of the graviton eld is written as h =
h
 and all lorentz indices are written as superscripts whereas the derivatives
are written as subscripts. all indices occurring twice are contracted by the
minkowski metric  = diag(1,1,1,1).

he is quadratic in the eld h (x):

(3.9)

from which, by means of the eulerlagrange variations with respect to h

we obtain the free equation of motion for h :

(3.10)

(3.11)

where r

l is the linearized, i.e. up to order , ricci tensor.

the equation of motion (3.11) and the free lagrangian (3.9) are invariant

under the gauge transformation

,   f 
if the vector eld f  satises the wave equation 2f  = 0.

h  h = h + f 

, + f 

, ,

(3.12)

the classical gauge transformation (3.12) corresponds to the linearized gen-
eral covariance of g (x): under a general coordinate transformation of the form
x = x(x), the metric tensor transforms according to

g (x) =

x
x

x
x g

(x) .

(3.13)

expanding g (x) =  +   (x) and considering a coordinate transformation
of the form x = x + f , we nd that terms in eq. (3.13) that are linear in
the elds  and f  are related by the transformation

   =  + f 

, + f 
, .

(3.14)

8

2  

since the tensor elds  and h are connected in rst approximation by
h =  + 1
, the gauge transformation (3.14) becomes the one of
eq. (3.12), therefore the latter is the formulation of general covariance for the
lorentz tensor eld h (x), a property that was already recognized in [14] and
discussed in a more general context in [15]. from eq. (3.13) it follows also
h(x) = 

h(x) under a lorentz transformation   l
+.

the gauge condition relative to the gauge transformation (3.12) is the hilbert



gauge condition

because it remains invariant under (3.12):

h (x), = 0 ,

(3.15)

, = 0  h
h

, = h

, + 2f 

+ f 

= 0 .

(3.16)

by imposing the gauge condition (3.15) on (3.11), we arrive at the free wave
equation

(cid:3)h (x) = 0 ,

(3.17)

for the massless graviton eld.

(3.21)

3.3 quantization of gravity

we consider now the graviton eld h (x) as a free quantum eld which satises
the wave equation (3.17) and quantize it by imposing the following lorentz
covariant commutation rule:

(cid:2)h(x), h (y)(cid:3) = i b d0(x  y) ,

9

(3.22)

with

b :=

1

2(cid:16) +    (cid:17) ,

(3.23)

(3.24)

and d0(x) is the mass-zero jordanpauli causal distribution:

d0(x) =

1
2

(x2) sgn(x0) =

i

(2)3z d4p (p2) sgn(p0) ei px .

the explicit free eld representation for the graviton eld h in (3.22) will be
given in sec. 5.3.

obviously, the ten components of h contain more than the true physical
degrees of freedom of a massless spin-2 eld (see sec. 6), this additional freedom
could be suppressed by a gauge condition h
, = 0 and a trace condition h =
0. as in gauge theories these condition are disregarded at the beginning and
considered later as conditions on the physical states.

in the causal approach the commutation rule (3.22) is xed by choosing as
operator gauge transformation that of (3.12) and by dening the gauge charge
q (see sec. 4), but it is independent from the choice of the expansion variable
in eq. (3.7).

alternatively, the form of the b-tensor (3.23) can be traced back to the

addition of the gauge xing term [16], [17]:

lgf = 2(cid:0) g(cid:1)(cid:0)g(cid:1) = h

, h
,

(3.25)

to the free lagrangian lhe; this extension is necessary for the total lagrangian
to be invertible (disregarding some divergences):

l(0)
he + lgf =

h

, h

, 

1
4

h,h, =

1
2

h

, bh

, = 

1
2

h b 2h ,

(3.26)

so that we obtain the feynman propagator

h|t(cid:8)h(x)h (y)(cid:9)|i = i b df

(2)4z d4p 1

p2 + i0

df

0 (x) =

0 (x  y) ,

ei px ,

(3.27)

where |i is the free fock vacuum.
the quantization of the gravitational eld in the path-integral framework
was carried out in [18], whereas the feynman rules for the s-matrix were already
given in [19].

on the other side, the feynman propagator in (3.27) can be derived by
means of the commutation rule (3.22), if we compute the time-ordered product
of the contraction between two eld operators: since the contraction is dened
as

c(cid:8)h(x)h (y)(cid:9) :=(cid:2)h(x)(), h (y)(+)(cid:3) ,

10

(3.28)

where h (x)() are the absorption and emission part of the free quantum eld,
respectively, we obtain

tnc(cid:8)h(x)h (y)(cid:9)o = (x0  y0)(cid:2)h(x)(), h (y)(+)(cid:3) +
+(y0  x0)(cid:2)h (y)(), h(x)(+)(cid:3)
= i b(cid:0)(x0  y0) d(+)
0 (y  x)(cid:1)
0 (x  y) + (y0  x0) d(+)
0 (x  y)(cid:1) = i b df
= i b(cid:0)dret
0 (x  y)  d()
0 (x  y) .

(3.29)

the commutation rule (3.22) leads also to the correct equal-time canonical
commutation relation between the eld and its canonical conjugate momentum
with respect to the gauge xed lagrangian dened by

 (t, x) =

(cid:0)l(0)

he + lgf(cid:1)

 h

= h (t, x) 

1
2

 h(t, x) ,

(3.30)

so that we have

(cid:2)h(t, x),  (t, y)(cid:3) = +

i

2(cid:8)



 + 



(cid:9) (3)(x  y) = +i l

 (3)(x  y) ,
(3.31)

which agrees with the fundamental poisson brackets derived in [20] and [21] and
where l is the unity for rank-4 tensors.

3.4 first order graviton interaction

since the perturbative expansion for the s-matrix (2.1) is in powers of the
coupling constant , we consider the normally ordered product

+ 2 : h(x)h (x),h(x), : + : h(x)h(x),h(x), :

1
2

: h(x)h(x),h(x), :

(3.32)

t h
1 (x) = i  :l(1)

he(x) :



= i

2(cid:8)+ : h(x)h(x),h(x), : 
 2 : h(x)h(x),h(x), :(cid:9) ,

as the cubic interaction among gravitons or rst order graviton interaction. we
will omit the double dots of the normal ordering and the space-time dependence,
if the meaning is clear.

after quantization, eq. (3.22), the coupling (3.32), completed by a suitable
ghost-graviton coupling term (see sec. 4.2), can be used in perturbation theory
to calculate quantum correction to classical general relativity.

two serious problems arise in this procedure. the rst one is the non-
renormalizability of quantum gravity due to presence of two derivatives on the
graviton elds in (3.32) whose origin lies in the dimensionality of the coupling
[] = mass1. the second one is the non-polynomial character of
constant:

11

lhe, eq. (3.8), which reects itself into a proliferation of couplings, i.e. into
an increasing polynomial degree in the interaction structure.
the rst drawback, non-renormalizability, can be in some manner cured by
means of the inductive causal construction of the tns, eq. (2.9), which makes
it possible to nd nite and cuto-free quantum corrections for any process de-
scribable in the s-matrix framework, although the solution is not quite clear
with regard to physical predictability because of the increasing number of nite
normalization terms in the distribution splitting (2.7) in each order of pertur-
bation theory.

with regard to the second issues, we could try to generalize the preliminary
result of [22] and the more recent result of [24], which suggest that the concept
of perturbative quantum operator gauge invariance (see sec. 4) may be able to
explain the higher polynomial couplings on a quantum level.

4 perturbative quantum operator gauge invariance

4.1 innitesimal asymptotic gauge transformations

the classical gauge transformation (3.12) can be implemented at the quantum
level as follows

(x) = ei  qh(x)ei  q
h

= h(x)  i (cid:2)q, h(x)(cid:3) 

2 (cid:2)q,(cid:2)q, h(x)(cid:3)(cid:3) +  ,

2

with the lorentz invariant and time-independent gauge charge

(4.1)

q := zx0=const

,

(4.2)

|

=j 0(x)

{z

}

where the gauge current is conserved, x
j (x) = 0, if 2u(x) = 0. the main
feature of the gauge charge q lies in the fact that the graviton eld appears here
in the hilbert gauge condition (3.15).

in order to get a nilpotent (q2 = 0) gauge charge, we have to quantize
the vector eld u(x), the ghost eld, with its partner u (x), the anti-ghost
eld (with 2u(x) = 0, too), as free fermionic vector elds through the anti-
commutator

(cid:8)u(x), u (y)(cid:9) = i  d0(x  y) ,

(4.3)

whereas all other anti-commutators vanish. the gauge charge q denes an
innitesimal gauge variation by

dqa := qa  (1)ng(a)aq ,

(4.4)

12

where ng(a) is the number of ghost elds minus the number of anti-ghost elds
in the wick monomial a. the operator dq obeys also the leibniz rule

dq(ab) = (dqa)b + (1)ng(a)adqb ,

(4.5)

for arbitrary operators a and b.

the innitesimal operator gauge variations of the fundamental asymptotic

free quantum elds read:

dqh(x), =(cid:2)q, h(x),(cid:3) = i bu(x), = 0 ,

dqh(x) =(cid:2)q, h(x)(cid:3) = i bu(x), ,
dq u(x) =(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = i h (x), .

dqu(x) =(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = 0 ,

(4.6)

the b-tensor appearing in the quantization rule (3.22) is consequently necessary
for the operator gauge transformation of h(x) to correspond to the classical
one, eq. (3.12), after having chosen the gauge charge q.

4.2 perturbative gauge invariance and ghost coupling

the asymptotic free elds are used in order to construct the time-ordered
renormalized products tn, eq. (2.9), in the adiabatically switched s-matrix,
eq. (2.1). therefore, gauge invariance of the s-matrix can be directly formu-
lated as conditions on the tns. formally, we have s-matrix gauge invariance
if

lim

g1(cid:0)s(g)  s(g)(cid:1) = lim

g1

then this condition becomes

(i  [q, s(g)] + higher commutators) = 0 .

(4.7)

lim

g1(cid:2)q, s(g)(cid:3) = 0 .

(4.8)

since the existence of the adiabatic limit in massless theories is problematic,
we use the perturbative version of the above equation. inserting in (4.8) the
perturbative expansion of s(g), we see that the perturbative gauge condition
for the tns:

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) = divergence in the sense of vector analysis ,

(4.9)

implies s-matrix gauge invariance, because divergences do not contribute in the
adiabatic limit due to partial integration and gauss theorem.

qg we nd that dqt h

already for n = 1 the above requirement is not at all trivial, because for
1 (x) 6= divergence. this requires the introduction of

13

an interaction between gravitons and ghosts. we choose this rst order ghost
coupling as in [25], [26] to be

t u

1 = i (cid:0)+ : u(x),h (x),u(x) :  : u(x),h(x)u(x), :
 : u(x),h(x)u (x), : + : u(x),h (x)u(x), :(cid:1) ,

so that the sum of (3.32) with (4.10) preserves perturbative gauge invariance to
rst order as shown in [22]:

(4.10)

dq(cid:0)t h

1 (x) + t u

 t 

1 (x)(cid:1) =: x

1/1(x) = sum of divergences .

(4.11)

one form of t 
1/1(x), the so-called q-vertex, was derived in [22]. the ghost
couplings in causal quantum gravity are analyzed in great detail in [23]. the
fermionic quantization of the ghost elds is not only necessary for having a
nilpotent q, but also for perturbative gauge invariance to be fullled.

the ghost elds, usually called faddeev-popov ghosts [18], are introduced
in the causal construction as a consequence of perturbative gauge invariance for
n = 1 in eq. (4.9). in the path-integral framework, the ghost elds appear as a
consequence of the quantization after gauge xing, but it was already noticed by
feynman [4] that without ghost elds a unitarity breakdown occurs in second
order at the loop level.

although the condition dqt1(x) = divergence seems to be rather easy to
full, it has two important consequences. first of all, it rules out the possibility
of a renormalizable theory of quantum gravity [24], because for a renormalizable
interaction t1(x), i.e. without the two derivatives acting on the elds1, rst
order perturbative gauge invariance entails only the trivial solution t1(x) = 0.
the other interesting consequence pointed out in [24] is that the requirement
dqt1(x) = divergence, where t1(x) is the most general ansatz for the graviton
coupling and the most general ansatz for the ghost coupling, selects a small
,
number of possible theories and the hilberteinstein graviton coupling t he
, eq. (4.10),
eq. (3.32), supplemented by the kugoojima ghost coupling t ko
lies among them, moreover all other couplings can be transformed in such a way
that the most general coupling has the form

1

1

t1(x) = t he

1

(x) + t ko

1

(x) + divergence couplings + dq(uhh + uuu) .

(4.12)

the last term represents the so-called coboundary terms which, together with
divergence terms, seem not to play any physical role.

the denition of the q-vertex from eq. (4.11) allows us to give a precise
prescription on how the right side of eq. (4.9) has to be inductively constructed.
we dene the concept of perturbative quantum operator gauge invariance by
the equation

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) =

n

xl=1


x
l

t 
n/l(x1, . . . , xl, . . . , xn) .

(4.13)

1with only one derivative it is impossible to form a lorentz scalar interaction term

14

here t 
n/l is the time-ordered renormalized product, obtained according to the
inductive causal scheme, with a q-vertex at xl, while all other n 1 vertices are
ordinary t1-vertices.
analysis of the condition (4.13) shows that perturbative gauge invariance can
be spoiled by local terms, i.e. terms proportional to :o(x1, . . . , xn) : (4n4)(x1
xn, . . . , xn1  xn), which appear as a consequence of distribution splitting on
both sides of eq. (4.13) in the tree graph sector.
if it is possible to absorb these local terms by suitable local normalization
n/l in such a way that the equation

terms (see eq. (2.9)) nn of tn and n 

n/l of t 

dq(cid:16)tn + nn(cid:17)(x1, . . . , xn) =

n

xl=1


x

l (cid:16)t 

n/l + n 

n/l(cid:17)(x1, . . . , xl, . . . , xn) (4.14)

holds true, then we call the theory gauge invariant to n-th order.

the analysis of perturbative gauge invariance for n = 2 was carried out
in [22], with the result that the n2(x1, x2)-terms, necessary in order for (4.14)
to hold, are local normalization terms of tree graphs with singular order   0
which agree exactly with the quartic expression in the expansion (3.8) of the
hilberteinstein lagrangian:

n2(x1, x2) = i 2 :l(2)

he(x1) : (4)(x1  x2) .

(4.15)

in this way perturbative gauge invariance generates the four-graviton coupling
and the proliferation of couplings can be understood on a quantum level.

such a property was already observed in yangmills theories [9], [27]: start-
ing with an interaction among three gauge elds, perturbative gauge invariance
to second order generates automatically the four gauge elds coupling and the
requirement of perturbative gauge invariance seems to be strong enough to select
the correct yangmills interaction among all the possible ones.

4.3 finite gauge transformations

the innitesimal gauge transformations (4.6) correspond to the nite gauge
transformations (4.1) generated by q. if we work out the latter we nd

h

 (x) = h (x)   bu(x), + 2 q h (x) q ,

(x) = u(x) +  h (x), + 2 i  u(x) q + i 2 h (x), q .
u

(4.16)

u

(x) = u(x)(cid:0)1 + 2 i q(cid:1) ,

these equations and the corresponding innitesimal version (4.6) have some
resemblance with the brst transformations for the gravitational eld. in fact,
they can be obtained by restricting the latter to their linearized versions.

as we saw in sec. 4.2, the lowest order graviton self-coupling alone is not
gauge invariant. this is the reason why ghost couplings must be introduced.

15

this is in contrast to brst theories of gravity [25], [26], where the gravitational
lagrangian, on the one hand, and the sum of the ghost interaction and the gauge
xing term, on the other hand are separately brst invariant.

5 quantization of the graviton field in fock space

5.1 classical tensor fields

h(x) under the proper lorentz group l

the classical tensor eld h(x), because of its transformation law h
) =


+, transforms as a symmetrized
tensor product of two spinor representations d(1/2,1/2). the product of two
such spinor representations can be decomposed into irreducible representations
as follows



 (x

d(1/2,1/2)  d(1/2,1/2) = d(1,1)  d(1,0)  d(0,1)  d(0,0) .

(5.1)

the rst representation d(1,1) is nine-dimensional and given by symmetric trace-
less tensors. the second one d(1,0) is three-dimensional and given by anti-self-
dual tensors, while the third one d(0,1) is also three-dimensional given by anti-
symmetric self-dual tensors. the last one d(0,0) is the trivial one-dimensional
representation given by scalar elds. the dimensions add up correctly to 44 =
16.
the classical symmetric tensor eld h has arbitrary trace, therefore has
9 + 1 = 10 independent components [6] and transforms as the symmetrization of
eq. (5.1), namely d(1,1)d(0,0). on the other hand, a pure massless spin-2 eld
has 2 2 + 1 = 5 independent components, so that 5 subsidiary conditions must
be imposed [14], [28]. those can be chosen in the following lorentz covariant
way:

h(x), = 0

and h

 = 0 .

(5.2)

the implementation of these equations on a quantum level will be the subject of
sec. 6. the construction of the graviton eld in the framework of the bargmann-
wigner theory is presented in [29], [30] and [31].

5.2 the quantum fields h  and  and their quantization

let us now consider a quantized graviton eld. eq. (5.1) suggests us the fol-
lowing lorentz covariant decomposition of h(x), according to d(1,1)  d(0,0),
into

h(x) = h (x) +

1
4

 (x) ,

(5.3)

where h (x) represents a traceless symmetric tensor eld dened as h (x) :=
h(x) h(x)/4 with h 
 = 0 (9 independent components) and (x) a scalar
eld with h

 = .

16

unlike the quantization proposed in [10], where the scalar component (x)
is considered as a true ghost-like degree of freedom like the ghost elds u(x)
and u(x), we consider this scalar component (x), necessary for the lorentz
covariant quantization given in (3.22), as a graviton component which turns out
to be unphysical, see sec. 6.

from eq. (3.22) we obtain the following commutation relations:

(cid:2)(x), (y)(cid:3) = 4 i d0(x  y) ,

(cid:2)h (x), h  (y)(cid:3) = i t d0(x  y) ,

(cid:2)h (x), (y)(cid:3) = 0 ,
2(cid:0) +   

1

1
2

(cid:1) .

with

t :=

with these new elds , the gauge transformation (3.12) becomes

h (x)  h

(x) = h (x) +  tu(x), ,

(x)  



(x) = (x)  2  u(x), .

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

the hilbert condition now reads h (x), + (x),/4 = 0 and the rst operator
gauge transformation in (4.6) now becomes

only the linear combination h (x), + (x),/4 has zero operator gauge vari-

and dq(x) = +i u(x), .

(5.7)

dqh (x) = i tu(x),
ation: dq(cid:0)h (x), + (x),/4(cid:1) = 0.

5.3 free field representations for h  and 

the lorentz covariant quantizations (5.4) have to be veried by constructing
explicit free eld representations.

about free graviton eld representation, there exists in the literature, among
various proposals, a mainstream approach which is based on the guptableuler
method of indenite metric fock spaces [32], [33] and [34]. but we choose to
avoid the use of indenite metric and realize all operators on a positive denite
fock space f which, however, later on will be given a krein structure, see
sec. 7.1.
to be consistent with the lorentz covariance of the commutation rules in
eq. (5.4), some components of the h-eld and the -eld must then be skew-
hermitian in contrast to others which are hermitian.

we quantize provisionally all eld components as being independent ones
and choose for h (x) and (x) the following non-lorentz covariant free eld

17

representations

h (x) = (2)3/2z

d3k

(x) = (2)3/2z

p2(k)(cid:16)a(k)ei kx + a(k)e+i kx(cid:17) ,

p2(k)(cid:16)a(k)ei kx  a(k)e+i kx(cid:17) ,

d3k

with (k) = |k|. the absorption/creation operators satisfy the commutation
relations

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

(cid:2)a(k), a (p)(cid:3) =  t (3)(k  p)

= t (3)(k  p) ,

(cid:2)a(k), a(p)(cid:3) = 4 (3)(k  p) .

since we work in a xed lorentz system, the indices of a and of t lose
their lorentz character and label only a particular component of the t-tensor or
of the operator a.

the factor  has the eect of changing the sign of a(k) in the 0i-
components, i = 1, 2, 3: h 0i  (a0i  a0i) and analogously for the -eld:
  (a  a). therefore these eld components are skew-adjoint:

h 0i

= h 0i

and  =  ,

(5.11)

so that the commutation rules (5.4) are consistent with the free eld deni-
tions (5.8) and (5.9).

this is not a serious drawback because it will turn out (see sec. 6) that these
components, which spoil self-adjointness, are unphysical and their expectation
values between physical states vanish.

the advantage of choosing the wrong sign and breaking self-adjointness as
well as explicit lorentz covariance lies in the fact that the commutation rules
for the 0i-components

(cid:2)a0i(k), a0j (p)(cid:3) = t 0i0j (3)(k  p) =

1
2

ij (3)(k  p) ,

(5.12)

and for the scalar eld in eq. (5.10) have a positive right side.

the t -tensor has the following values:

t(,)

(00, 00)

(00, ii)

(0i, 0i)

3/4

1/4

1/2

(ii, ii)
3/4

(ii, jj)
-1/4

(ij, ij)

otherwise

1/2

0

with i, j = 1, 2, 3; i 6= j. from this table we see that the t -tensor is neither
diagonal: t = 0 for () 6= (), nor positive denite: t > 0, , , , ,
although it is positive for the diagonal terms: t > 0 for () = 00, 0i, ii, ij.
moreover, until now we have not been making use of the fact that h 
 = 0,
which certainly has implications on the a-operators.

18

in order to remedy these defects, we dene new absorption operators:

a00 =

a11 =

a22 =

a33 =

1
2
1
2
1
2
1
2

(+a11 + a22 + a33) ,

(a11 + a22 + a33) ,
(+a11  a22 + a33) ,
(+a11 + a22  a33) ;

(5.13)

and analogously for the creation operators. then we obtain the commutation
relations

(cid:2)aii(k), ajj(p)(cid:3) = ij (3)(k  p) ,

(5.14)

which have also positive right side.

note that the operators a00 and a00 do not appear here because this operator
 = 0: from the denitions (5.13)

pair is superuous due to the trace condition h 
we get

ajj = a00 .

3

xj=1

(5.15)

the equations (5.13) can be solved for the aii-operators:

a11 = a00  a11 ,

a22 = a00  a22 ,

a33 = a00  a33 .

(5.16)

this means that the a-operators are not the fundamental ones and must be
replaced by the aiis in the construction of the fock space.

5.4 fock space construction

we quantize the h -graviton and the scalar graviton  as 10 independent
scalar elds. with the following denitions for the absorption operators

b0i(k) := a0i(k) ,
bii(k) := aii(k) ,

bij(k) := aij(k) ,
b00(k) := a(k)/2 ;

(5.17)

(5.18)

and analogous ones for the creation operators, we can recast the commutation
rules (5.10), (5.12) and (5.14) in the form

with

(cid:2)b(k), b (p)(cid:3) = l (3)(k  p) ,

the l-tensor is diagonal and always positive

l =

1

2(cid:0) +  (cid:1) .

let us consider the multi-particle hilbert space hn00,n01,... ,n23,n33 with n00
b00-particles, n01 b01-particles, . . . , n23 b23-particles and n33 b33-particles,
then the graviton fock space is dened by

f :=



mn00,n01,... ,n23,n33=0

hn00,n01,... ,n23,n33 .

(5.21)

one-graviton states can be described by true lorentz tensor potentials, or wave-
functions, (x). for simplicity we do not write explicitly the time-dependence
which is of the form exp(i (k) t). then one-graviton states are linear combina-
tions of the form

|i = b()|i =z d3k

3

x,=0

(k) b(k) |i ,

|i (cid:16)h1,0,... ,0    h0,0,... ,0,1(cid:17) ,

where |i is the free fock vacuum.

the scalar product h|i is evaluated by means of eq. (5.19)

h|i =

3

x,=0z d3k (k) (k) =: (, )e

and the norm obtained from this scalar product is positive denite. the sub-
script e informs us that the sum is a euclidean one and not a minkowski
one.

generalization to n-graviton states is straightforward

according to the general theory [35], if the graviton eld h has to be a poincare
invariant operator-valued distribution (see sec. 8), it cannot be a pure spin-2

21

eld, therefore we cannot have a local theory involving only physical gravitons.
states corresponding to spin-1 and spin-0 must also be present in the fock space
and auxiliary conditions like eq. (5.2) must be imposed to single out the physical
states [32], [33] and [34].

the fock space for the graviton previously constructed is large: we had to

quantize the ten independent components of the h -eld and of the -eld.

since the true physical states of a spin-2 massless particle are represented
by only two 2-helicity states, we have to reduce the number of independent
components from ten to two. this reduction implies a selection of a subspace
fphys, the physical subspace, in f that contains only these physical particle
states.
this task is accomplished with the help of the gauge charge q, eq. (4.2),

and we can specify the physical subspace through the denition

fphys := ker(cid:16)(cid:8)q, q(cid:9)(cid:17) .

(6.1)

the motivation for such a denition of fphys resides in the fact that the operator
(cid:8)q, q(cid:9) has the form of a sum of particle number operators which counts the
unphysical degrees of freedom, therefore the kernel of(cid:8)q, q(cid:9) does not contain

them.

6.1 ghost fields quantization

before embarking in the calculation of (cid:8)q, q(cid:9), we need also to quantize the

ghost and anti-ghost vector elds.

they satisfy the lorentz covariant anti-commutation rule (4.3) and we as-
sume that creation/absorption operators satisfy the anti-commutation relations

(cid:8)c(p), c (k)(cid:9) =  (3)(p  k) ,
(cid:8)b(p), b (k)(cid:9) =  (3)(p  k) ,

whereas all other anti-commutators vanish.

(6.2)

as usual in the framework of second quantization for fermionic particles.

the fock space for the ghost elds fg can be constructed starting with (6.2)
the ghost free eld representations are then

d3p

u(x) = (2)3/2z
u(x) = (2)3/2z

d3p

p2(p)(cid:16) + b(p)ei px  c (p)ei px(cid:17) ,
p2(p)(cid:16)  c (p)ei px   b(p)ei px(cid:17) .

(6.3)

other issues about the ghost elds will be discussed in sec. 7.2.

6.2 the physical subspace fphys
we must be careful and discriminate between the true lorentz indices of k
and the labelling indices of the operators a, c and b . these latter will be
always written as superscript.

a = 0.

for this purpose let us choose a reference frame in which k = (, 0, 0, )
is parallel to the third axis, because obviously the unphysical graviton modes
depend on k, and substitute the as by the aiis, eq. (5.13), so that the

6.3 hamilton operators

we compute the generators of the time evolutions for the elds h (x) and
(x), respectively. these free quantum elds satisfy the heisenberg equations
of motion

i h (x) =(cid:2)hh, h (x)(cid:3) , i (x) =(cid:2)h, (x)(cid:3) .

the hamilton operators are easily found by (5.10) and read:

if we restrict these operators to the physical subspace fphys and, in addition,
choose the special reference frame as in sec. 6, we nd that the integrand of
(cid:0)hh + h(cid:1) reads

this expression can be recast with (6.20) into

which conrms that graviton states in fphys have only two independent compo-

6.4 one-graviton states in fphys
as in sec. 5.4, we identify one-graviton states |i with lorentz tensor potentials
(x) through eq. (5.22). for a state |i  fphys the constraints

00 = 0 ,

ii = 0 , 0i = 0 , ij

are satised. these eight conditions imply that  has the same form as the
classical polarization tensor (6.16) with only two degrees of freedom.

7 krein structure and pseudo-unitarity

the drawback of the eld representations (5.8) and (5.9) is that they do not
have a unitary implementation of poincare invariance. in order to remedy this
defect, we introduce a new conjugation on the fock space with respect to which
the theory is unitary.

26

7.1 poincare invariance and krein structure in the graviton

sector

here we follow the ideas and methods used in [12] for the photon eld case, by
extending them to the more involved case of a rank-2 tensor eld. considering
the elds smeared out with real schwartz test functions

h(f ) =z d4x f (x)h  (x) , (g) =z d4x g(x)(x) ;

then the poincare transformations of the test functions



f

(x



) =  

  

 f(1(x  a)) ,





g

(x

) = g(1(x  a)) ,

are lifted into fock space by the denitions

(7.1)

(7.2)

u(a, ) h(f ) u(a, )1 = h(f



u(a, ) (g) u(a, )1 = (g

) =z d4x f(x)(cid:0)1(cid:1)



(cid:0)1(cid:1)

) =z d4x g(x) (x + a) .

 h (x + a) ,

(7.3)

(7.4)

these lead to the transformation laws for the eld operators:

u(a, ) h  (x)u(a, )1 =(cid:0)1(cid:1)

u(a, ) (x) u(a, )1 = (x + a) .

(cid:0)1(cid:1)

 h (x + a) ,

the problem is that the above representation u(a, ) is not unitary, because of
the non-self-adjointness of h 0i(x) and of (x).

nevertheless, we can introduce another conjugation, k, in fock space such
that u(a, ) is pseudo-unitary, i.e. unitary with respect to the k-conjugation:

u(a, )k = u(a, )1 .

(7.5)

the new conjugation k, which denes the so-called krein structure on f, acts
on the eld operators as

(cid:0)h (x)(cid:1)k = h h (x)



h ,

(cid:0)(x)(cid:1)k =  (x)  ,

where h and  are the krein operators for the h-sector and -sector, respec-
tively:

(7.6)

h =

3

oi=1
(1)n0i ,

 = (1)n ;

(7.7)

with the particle number operators for the 0i-modes of the h-graviton and for
the scalar graviton 

n0i = 2z d3k a0i(k)a0i(k) , n =

1

4z d3k a(k)a(k) ;

(7.8)

27

which turned out to be unphysical, see sec. 6. this k-conjugation shares all the
properties of the -adjoint and the elds h (x) and (x) become self-conjugate
with respect to the k-conjugation:

(cid:0)h (x)(cid:1)k = h (x) ,

(cid:0)(x)(cid:1)k = (x) ;

because the skew-adjointness with respect to the -adjoint is compensated by
anti-commuting with h and  respectively: eq. (7.6) for the absorption oper-
ators implies

(7.9)

(7.10)

(7.11)

a(p)k =  a(p)  = a(p) ,


a0i(p)k = h a0i(p)

h = a0i(p) ,

from which the k-self-conjugacy of the elds is evident:

h (x) = (2)3/2z
(x) = (2)3/2z

d3k

d3k

p2(k)(cid:16)a(k)ei kx + a(k)ke+i kx(cid:17) ,
p2(k)(cid:16)a(k)ei kx + a(k)ke+i kx(cid:17) .

from the physical point of view, the k-conjugation is indistinguishable from
the -adjoint, because matrix elements between physical states are the same.
for |i,|i  fphys we have
h|(cid:0)h (cid:1)k|i = h|h h  
because the number of unphysical 0i-gravitons, i = 1, 2, 3, is zero for states in
fphys. the same holds for . therefore the lack of self-adjointness in h (x)
and in (x) does not cause any problem.

h|i = hh |h  

|h i = h|h  

|i ,

(7.12)

7.2 krein structure in the ghost sector

we extend the -adjoint to the k-conjugation also in the ghost sector. the
fully investigation of the fermionic ghost vector elds is not carried out here, we
note only that micro-causality, eq. (4.3), is not broken, because of the unusual
mixture of creation and absorption operators in the ghost free eld representa-
tions (6.3). the ghost elds have non-causal anti-commutation relations with
their adjoints so that they do not full the assumptions of the spin-statistic
theorem and therefore they are allowed to escape its consequences [36].

for later use (sec. 9), we now require the ghost eld u(x) to be k-self-

conjugate and the anti-ghost eld u(x) to be k-skew-conjugate:

(cid:0)u(x)(cid:1)k = u(x) ,

(cid:0)u(x)(cid:1)k = u(x) .

(7.13)

28

these requirements imply that there must exist a krein operator g acting on
the ghost fock space so that we have for the creation and absorption operators

(cid:0)b(p)(cid:1)k = g b(p) g =((cid:0)b0(p)(cid:1)k = g b0(p) g = c0(p) ,
(cid:0)bi(p)(cid:1)k = g bi(p) g = +ci(p) ,
(cid:0)c(p)(cid:1)k = g c(p) g =((cid:0)c0(p)(cid:1)k = g c0(p) g = b0(p) ,
(cid:0)ci(p)(cid:1)k = g ci(p) g = +bi(p) .

again, it is the unusual mixture of b and c operators in (6.3) that makes (7.13)
and (7.14) possible.

(7.14)

d3p

elds the more symmetric form

extending the -adjoint to the k-conjugation we obtain also for the ghost
u(x) = (2)3/2z
u(x) = (2)3/2z

p2(p)(cid:16) + b(p)ei px + b(p)kei px(cid:17) ,
p2(p)(cid:16)  c (p)ei px + c (p)kei px(cid:17) .

the construction of g, which performs the transformations (7.13) requires more
work. let us dene the following conserved currents

(7.15)

d3p

j
n (x) := i : u(x)

j
u (x) := i : u(x)



x u(x) :  ,

x u(x) :  ,


j
g(x) := i : u(x)

j
u (x) := i : u(x)



x u(x) :  ,


x u(x) :  .

(7.16)

from these currents we compute the conserved ghost charges by inserting the
free eld representations (6.3) and using the anti-commutation relations (6.2):

(7.21)

which implements the heisenberg time evolutions of the ghost and anti-ghost
elds

the charges in (7.20) and the gauge charge q satisfy

qk = q , qk

g = qg , n k

g = ng , k

(x) =(cid:2)hg, u(x)(cid:3) .
g = g .

g = g , k

finally, the krein operator g that implements (7.14) is given by

(7.22)

(7.23)

(7.24)

g = exp(cid:16)i



2(cid:0)ng  g(cid:1)(cid:17) .

the motivation for this result can be traced back to the algebraic analysis of
ghost elds within non-abelian gauge theories in [36]. the proof that the krein
operator given in (7.24) produces the desired relations (7.14) is just a simple
consistency check by means of the baker-hausdor formula and of the commu-
tators of the ghost charges ng and g with b and c.

8 gauge transformation and poincare invariance

the representation of poincare transformations for fock space operators by
means of the pseudo-unitary u(a, ) cannot be the correct implementation of
physical relativistic invariance, that is of the fact that physical predictions have
to be independent from the choice of reference frames which are moving uni-
formly to each other.

a poincare transformation must give rise to a unitary mapping between
physical states in fphys. this unitary mapping is realized if we take advantage
of the gauge freedom still present in the theory.
we analyze this issue for the case of one-graviton states, the generalization
to many-graviton states is straightforward although very cumbersome. first we
need some technical preparation.

30

8.1 one-graviton states and hilbert-einstein subspace fhe
although the fock space for gravitons is constructed with the help of the b-
operators, sec. 5.4, for the purpose of this section it is convenient to use the
a-operators and the a-operator of eq. (5.10) in order to describe one-graviton
states.

since the as are not independent, because of a
on the lorentz tensor potential  has to be imposed.

 = 0, another constraint

we consider one-graviton states (skipping the time dependence) of the form

|i =(cid:0)a() + a(f )(cid:1)|i
=z d3k(cid:16) 3
x,=0

 (k) a (k) +

1
4

f (k) a(k)(cid:17) |i ,

(8.1)

and represent it through the identication between a fock space vector, on the
one hand, and a traceless symmetric tensor potential together with a scalar
potential, on the other hand:

|i  h(1) (  (x) with (x) = 0 , 2 (x) = 0

and f (x) with 2f (x) = 0 .

the scalar product in the scalar sector is

and in the tensor sector reads

(f, g)scal :=z d3p f (p)g(p) ,
iz d3xh (x)t (x) (cid:0)t (x)(cid:1) (x)i .

(8.2)

(8.3)

(8.4)

with the fourier representation of the tensor potential

(, )e :=

3

x,=0
 (t, x) = (2)3/2z

the scalar product becomes

 (p) ei((p) tpx) ,

(8.5)

d3p

p2(p)

(, )e =

3

x,=0z d3p  (p)  (p) ;

(8.6)

this formula already appeared in eq. (5.23). the sum over  and  in (8.4) is
not a minkowski scalar product, but it can be written in a lorentz covariant
way as a surface integral

(, )e =

that can be taken over an arbitrary smooth space-like surface as a consequence
of gauss theorem and of the wave equation for the tensor potentials.

the fock space scalar product between one-graviton states |i and |i, char-
acterized by { (x), f (x)} and { (x), g(x)}, respectively, can be computed
by means of eq. (5.10):
h|i =z d3kz d3p(cid:18) 3

f (k)g(p)(cid:19) (3)(k  p) .

(k) t  (p) +

(8.8)

(8.9)

a one-graviton state |i  fphys certainly satises

a0(p)|i = a

k (p)|i = a (p)|i = a(p)|i = 0 ,

(8.10)

because of eq. (6.11). therefore the potentials { (x), f (x)} are constrained
as follows

00 = 0i =

3

xi=1

ii = ij

,j = f = 0 .

(8.11)

these nine conditions reduce the number of independent components of  (x)
and f (x) from eleven to two.

although (8.11) depends on the reference frame, fphys is independent of such
a choice, because one can show that the identication fphys = ker q/ran q is
equivalent to eq. (6.1) and independent of a reference frame [37].
in addition to the physical subspace fphys, we introduce the hilberteinstein

subspace fhe of states which satisfy the hilbert-einstein gauge condition

obviously, states in fphys are automatically in fhe.

8.2 poincare invariance and gauge projection

the aim of this section is to show that for |i and |i in fphys, the scalar product
h|i remains invariant under a poincare transformation x  x = x + a in
p 
+, provided that the tensor potentials undergo a gauge transformation along a
bre of gauge equivalent states, whereas the scalar potentials remain unaected.

for physical states, h|i can be written as a minkowski scalar product

h|i =

x,=0z d3k  (k)  (k) =z d3k  (k)  (k) =: (, )m (8.14)

because  and  have vanishing 0i-components.

under a poincare transformation (7.2), the states |i and |i are rotated
out of fphys, this means that the tensor potentials acquire non-vanishing 0-
components, whereas

nevertheless, (, )m remains invariant, because the minkowski product now

now, we would like to transform the expression for the poincare transformed

and vanishes because the scalar product between two solutions of the wave

since now 0 = 0 = 0,  = 0, . . . , 3, we arrive at

(8.21)

with | i and | i in fphys. eq. (8.21) contains the desired unitary mapping in
fphys:

h | i = h u| ui = h| u u|i = h|i ,

(8.22)

with u = u1. therefore the pseudo-unitary fock space implementation of
poincare transformations cooperates with a gauge projection to give a unitary
transformation u in fphys.

9 unitarity

unitarity is the root of the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics
and of s-matrix theory. in quantum gravity, as in non-abelian gauge theories,
unitarity is a very important property, which one has to prove, because the
fock space f contains a lot of unphysical states (ghost states and additional
polarization states of the h-graviton and of the -graviton).
nevertheless, there exist a physical subspace fphys, eq. (6.1), with a positive
denite scalar product, eq. (8.9), such that the s-matrix restricted to fphys is
unitary, whereas unitarity does not hold on the entire fock space f.
in this section we arrange the proof of unitarity for non-abelian gauge the-
ories [37], [38] to the quantum gravity case.

9.1 s-matrix unitarity on fphys
the total krein operator  = h    g denes the k-conjugation acting as
(9.1)

ok =  o  ,

on the fock space operator o. using (7.9) and (7.13), we nd that the rst
order interaction t h+u
(x), eq. (3.32) and eq. (4.10), is skew-conjugate with
respect to the k-conjugation:

1

1

(cid:0)t h+u

(x)(cid:1)k = t h+u

1

(x) = t h+u

1

(x) ,

(9.2)

where t1(x) is the rst term in the expansion of the inverse s-matrix (see below),
and is poincare invariant:

u(a, ) t h+u

1

(x) u(a, )1 = t h+u

1

(x + a) ,

(9.3)

where u(a, ) is pseudo-unitary, eq. (7.5).

by induction, these properties hold for the n-point operator valued distri-

butions tn:

tn(x1, . . . , xn)k = tn(x1, . . . , xn) ,

u(a, ) tn(x1, . . . , xn) u(a, )1 = tn(x1 + a, . . . , xn + a) ,

(9.4)

where tn is the n-point distribution belonging to s(g)1, the inverse s-matrix

s(g)1 = 1 +



xn=1

1

n!z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn) g(x1)  . . .  g(xn) .

(9.5)

in the inductive construction of the tns, these properties can get lost in the pro-
cess of distribution splitting only, eq. (2.7), but if the normalization constants
ca are chosen in a suitable way, pseudo-unitarity and poincare invariance go
over from the rst order (9.2) and (9.3) to higher orders (9.4), [12].

the rst equation in (9.4) is the perturbative version of s-matrix pseudo-

unitarity (with a real test function g):

s(g)k = s(g)1 .

(9.6)

unitarity of s(g) is changed into pseudo-unitarity because of the unphysical
degrees of freedom present in the theory and because of the fact that the elds
h 0i and  are not hermitian. only after the elimination of these two obstacles,
by means of projecting onto fphys, we are able to show unitarity on the physical
subspace, by which we mean the heuristic equation

lim

g1hpphys s(g) pphysihpphys s(g) pphysi = pphys ,

(9.7)

35

where pphys stands for the projection operator onto fphys. perturbatively,
eq. (9.7) goes over into

t p
n (x) = pphys tn(x) pphys + sum of divergences ,

(9.8)

n (x) is the n-point distribution of the s-matrix

where x = {x1, . . . , xn} and t p
inverted on fphys:
(cid:0)pphys s(g) pphys(cid:1)1 = pphys +



xn=1

1

n!z d4x1 . . . d4xn t p

n (x1, . . . , xn) 
 g(x1)  . . .  g(xn) .

(9.9)

the divergences appearing on the right side of (9.8) do not contribute in the
adiabatic limit g  1. our aim is to prove eq. (9.8). according to the theory of
the inductive construction of the s-matrix [12], t p
n (x) is given by the following
sum over subsets of x

t p
n (x) =

n

(1)r xperm. of r
xr=1

partition of x

pphys tn1(x1) pphys . . . pphys tnr (xr) pphys .

using perturbative gauge invariance to the n-th order, eq. (4.13)

we can get rid of all the internal physical projections (see sec. 9.2) so that

(cid:2)q, tn(x)(cid:3) = sum of divergences ,

(9.10)

(9.11)

t p
n (x) =

n

(1)r xperm. of r
xr=1

partition of x

pphystn1(x1) . . . tnr (xr) pphys + divergences

= pphys tn(x) pphys + divergences ,

(9.12)

because of the formula for the inductive construction of tn(x) [12]. by means
of pseudo-unitarity, t k

n (x) = tn(x), we arrive at

t p
n (x) = pphys t k

n (x) pphys + divergences .

since on fphys the k-conjugation agrees with the -adjoint, we obtain

t p
n (x) = pphys t 

n(x) pphys + divergences ,

(9.13)

(9.14)

which is the desired form of perturbative unitarity on the physical subspace.

roughly speaking, we have shown that (cid:0)pphys s(g) pphys(cid:1)1, constructed by
n s, agrees with (cid:0)pphys s(g) pphys(cid:1), obtained by means of the

means of the t p
t 
ns, up to divergence terms that do not contribute in the adiabatic limit.

9.2 fock space decomposition and gauge charge

the most dicult step is the elimination of the internal projections on fphys in
eq. (9.10). in order to accomplish this step, we take advantage of the relation
between gauge charge q and decomposition of the fock space f, [38]. since
q and q are unbounded operators (the unboundedness is due not only to
the presence of emission and absorption operators but also to the presence of
(p) = |p| in the expressions for q and q in momentum space, eq. (6.5)), we
have the direct decomposition of the fock space f in the form:

f = ran q  ker q = ran q  ker q ,

(9.15)
where the over-lining denote closure. since q2 = 0, ran q  ran q, therefore
(9.16)

f = ran q  ran q (cid:16)(ker q)  (ker q)(cid:17) .

the range of q and q certainly consists of unphysical states only, because q and
q only contain emission operators for these unphysical states (absorption oper-
ators also appear, but since these latter are always paired with the corresponding
creation operators, the resulting state is always unphysical). therefore, since

(cid:16)(ker q)  (ker q)(cid:17) = ker(cid:16)(cid:8)q, q(cid:9)(cid:17) = fphys ,

we nd the direct orthogonal decomposition

1 = pq + pq + pphys ,

(9.17)

(9.18)

where pq and pq are the projectors onto ran q and onto ran q, respectively.
with k := {q, q} positive self-adjoint on f 
with k 1pphys = 0 and k k 1 = pq + pq so that

phys, there exists k 1 on f 

phys

1 = k k 1 + pphys = pphys + q q k 1 + q q k 1 .

(9.19)

if x1 and x2 are two disjoint sets of points, then

pphys tn1(x1) tn2(x2) pphys = pphys tn1(x1)hpphys + q q k 1 +
+ q q k 1i tn2(x2) pphys =

= pphys tn1(x1) pphys tn2(x2) pphys +

(9.20)

+ pphys tn1(x1) q q k 1 tn2(x2) pphys +
+ pphys tn1(x1) q q k 1 tn2(x2) pphys .

since pphys q = 0, the second term becomes

pphys tn1(x1) q q k 1 tn2(x2) pphys =

= pphys (cid:2)tn1(x1), q(cid:3)
}

{z

divergence

|

q k 1 tn2(x2) pphys = divergence .

(9.21)

37

analogously, since [k 1, q] = 0, the third term becomes

pphys tn1(x1) q q k 1 tn2(x2) pphys =
= pphys tn1(x1) q k 1 q tn2(x2) pphys =

= pphys tn1(x1) q k 1 (cid:2)q, tn2(x2)(cid:3)
}

{z

therefore we obtain the relation

divergence

|

pphys = divergence .

(9.22)

pphys tn1(x1) tn2 (x2) pphys = pphys tn1(x1) pphys tn2(x2) pphys + divergences .
(9.23)

the above relation can be generalized to the case of r nr-point distributions tnr
and used to eliminate the internal physical projectors from eq. (9.10).
