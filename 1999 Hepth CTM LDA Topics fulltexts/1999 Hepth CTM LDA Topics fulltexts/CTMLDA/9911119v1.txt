abstract

non-bps dyon solutions to d3-brane actions are constructed when one or
more scalar elds describing transverse uctuations of the brane, are consid-
ered. the picture emerging from such non-bps congurations is analysed, in
particular the response of the d-brane-string system to small perturbations.

i. introduction

solutions to dirac-born-infeld (dbi) theory have recently drawn much attention in con-
nection to the dynamics of dp-branes [1]- [15]. indeed, the dbi action for p + 1 dimensional
gauge elds and a number of scalars describing transverse uctuations of the brane allow
static bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld (bps) and non-bps congurations, which can be
interpreted in terms of branes and strings attached to them.

although many (static) properties related to intersecting branes come from supersym-
metry and bps arguments, specic dynamical features depend strongly on the non-linearity
of the dbi action. in particular, those related to the eective boundary conditions imposed
to strings attached to branes must be investigated using the full dbi action. moreover,
non-bps congurations might be useful for the study of certain non-perturbative aspects of
eld theories that describe the low energy dynamics of branes [16].

bps and non-bps (throat) purely electric solutions to dbi theory were constructed
in [3]- [4]. also the propagation of a perturbation normal to both the string and the 3-
brane action was investigated in [3] for a bps background. the results obtained show that
the picture of a string attached to the brane with dirichlet boundary conditions emerges
naturally from dbi dynamics. in [8]- [9] perturbations polarized along the brane in a bps
background were studied and it was shown that neumann boundary conditions are realized
in this case.

other purely electric non-bps solutions to dbi action for the world volume gauge eld
and scalar elds were constructed in [6] where also magnetically charged bps solutions were
discussed. a detailed study of bps dyonic solutions was presented later in [10].

in this paper we concentrate in the case of d3-branes and explicitly construct non-
bps dyon solutions when the u(1) gauge eld couples to one or more scalar elds. we then
analyse the solutions in connection with the geometry of the bending of the brane due to the
tension of a (n, m)-string [17]- [18] carrying both electric and magnetic charges . studying
the energy of these non-bps congurations, we compare the results with those obtained
in the purely electric bps and non-bps cases [3]- [10]. we also study small excitations,
transverse both to the brane and to the string, in order to test whether the response of
the non-bps solution is consistent with the interpretation in which the brane-string system
described corresponds to the appropriate (dirichlet) boundary condition.

the plan of the paper is as follows: in section ii we construct the non-bps solutions, with
both electric and magnetic charges, to the dbi model for an abelian gauge eld in the world
volume, coupled to one scalar. we discuss the properties of the solutions and compare them
to other solutions already described in the literature. we also compute the renormalized
energy and interpret the dyonic non-bps solution in terms of strings attached to d3-branes.
then, in section iii, we consider small perturbations to the non-bps background, normal
to the brane and to the string, in order to test the resulting boundary conditions. finally,
we summarize and discuss our results in section iv.

ii. solutions of the dirac-born-infeld action

the d3-brane action in the static gauge takes the form

s = t3z d4xqdet( + t 1f + x ax a)

(1)

where  is minkowski metric in 3 + 1 dimensions, diag() = (1, 1, 1, 1), f is the world
volume electromagnetic gauge eld strength, x a are scalar elds (a = 4, 5, . . . , 9) which
describe transverse uctuations of the brane and

t3 =

1

2gs

t 2 , t =

1

(2)

with gs the string coupling constant. this action can be obtained by dimensional reduction
of a born-infeld action in 10 dimensional at space-time (xm , m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9), assuming
that the elds depend only on the rst 1 + 3 coordinates x and that the extra components
a4, a5 . . . a9 of the gauge eld represent the scalar elds. we shall consider rst the case in
which there is just one excited scalar eld, x a = a9x. in this case eq.(1) takes the form

s = t3z d4x(cid:18)(1 + xx)(cid:18)1 +

now, since we are interested in bion solutions [3]- [4] carrying both electric qe and mag-
netic qm charges, this necessarily implies that ~e and ~b have delta function sources (c.f. [19]
where dyon congurations with an extended magnetic source are constructed). for the case
x = 0 one easily nds such a solution to (4) in the form

this solution can be obtained from the purely electric born-infeld one by a duality rotation
[20].

following [4]- [6] , we construct the general solution by performing a boost (in 10 dimen-

sional space) in the x9 direction leading to

and a is related to the square of the boost velocity. the electric and magnetic elds associated
with (9) take the form

note that since the boost is in the x9 direction, it does not aect the transverse xi , i =
1, 2, . . . , 8 directions. moreover, since we are considering static solutions, a in (9) is not
aected and the magnetic eld remains unchanged by the boost.

these solutions generalize all known (one source) solutions already discussed in the dbi-
brane context, either the bps or non-bps ones. setting qm = 0 we recover, for a < 1, the
electric bions, for a > 1, the electric throat/catenoid solutions and, for a = 1, the electric
bps solution [3]- [6]. the new solutions we have found generalize these electric bions and
throats to dyonic ones.

concerning the magnetic eld ~b, it is important to note that its value is a independent
and has the usual dirac monopole functional form corresponding to a quantized magnetic
charge. indeed, the magnetic induction ~h is given by

~h

r (cid:18) ~b +(cid:16) ~b  ~x(cid:17) ~x

the electric and magnetic charges of the solutions were adjusted so that

dsiei = qe ,

zs

dsibi = qm

zs

it is useful to dene the scalar eld charge qs in the form
dsiix = a qe

qs  t zs

in terms of charges, r0 in (10) takes the form

r

(12)

0 = (4t )2(cid:16)q2

e + q2

s(cid:17)
m  q2
m + q2

from (9) one can see that, in the range q2

e , the scalar takes essentially the
form depicted in fig. 1. qualitatively, its behavior is similar to the purely electric solution
found in [6] except that the existence of a non-zero magnetic charge lowers the height of the
cusp.

s  q2

for q2

s > q2

e + q2

m the scalar takes the form of the solution depicted in fig. 2 which can be
viewed as two asymptotically at branes (in fact, a brane-antibrane pair) joined by a throat
of radius rt. these branes are separated a distance  = 2|x(rt)| which corresponds to the
dierence between the two asymptotic values of x(r). the radius of the throat is given by

note that increasing the magnetic charge makes the throat slimmer and  larger.

note that r0 = 0 implies that the boost parameter a = 1 + q2
e > 1. in particular, for
qm = 0 the boost is a light-cone one. in fact, qm = 0 corresponds to  = 0 and then (9)
reduces to the electric bps solution discussed in [3]- [4]. the choice  = /2 (qe = 0)
corresponds to the magnetic bps solution discussed in [4]. for arbitrary  our bps solution
coincides with that analysed in [10].

let us now compute the static energy for the non-bps congurations described earlier
and relate it to the bending of branes. we consider the case in which there is only one
d3-brane and rst compute the energy stored in the world volume of the brane for the
conguration (9)-(11) with r4

since the bps limit is reached when r0 = 0, we see that ewv diverges precisely at the point
which should correspond to the lower bound for the energy. in order to avoid this problem,
one can normalize the energy with respect to the bogomolnyi value. to this end we dene

e = ewv  esub = ewv

(23)

clearly, e = 0 in the bps case (r0 = 0). in general, 0  e <  and then the bps
conguration gives the lower bound for the energy. we show in fig. 3 the energy as given

5

by (23) as a function of the scalar charge. at xed electric charge, one can see that, as the
magnetic charge grows, the bogomolnyi bound is attained for larger scalar charge.

the subtraction performed in (23) can be interpreted as follows. using eq.(9), ewv, as

given by eq.(22), can be written as

ewv =

t

6gs

|qs| (cid:16)2(q2

e + q2

m) + q2

s(cid:17) |x(0)|

concerning the subtracted term, it takes the form

esub =

t

2gsqq2

e + q2

m |x(0)|

(24)

(25)

the connection between the dyon electric eld and fundamental strings leads to the quan-
tization of the electric ux [3] so that qe = 2gsn. for the magnetic charge, we write
qm = 2m. then, esub can be rewritten in the form

esub = tsn2 +

1
g2
s

m2|x(0)|

the renormalized energy e as dened in (23) can then be written as

e = ewv  t(n,m)z |x(0)|
= ewv + t(n,m)z 

|x(0)|

0

dx

dx  t(n,m)z

where

t(n,m) = tsn2 +

1
g2
s

m2

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

formula (28) makes clear the rationale of the subtraction: the second term in the r.h.s.
of (28) represents the energy of a semi-innite string (with tension t(n,m)) extending from
the cusp of the spike to innity. the third term subtracts the innite energy of a string
extending from 0 (from a at brane) to innity. we are then computing the energy of a brane
pulled by a string with respect to the energy of a non-interacting conguration brane+string
(which turns to be a bps solution).

we represent in gure 4 a sequence of growing spikes as the scalar charge increases up

to the point it attains its bps value qbp s

s

.

one can also compute the static energy stored in the worldvolume for the throat solution
t = r2
(r2

0 > 0). one gets

where t(n,m) is dened by eq.(29). then, the nite energy e in (32) corresponds to the dier-
ence between the throat solution and a non-interacting conguration brane-string-antibrane.
we shall now briey describe non-bps solutions of the dbi action when two scalar
elds are present. starting from action (1) with x 8 = x and x 9 = y , the corresponding

it is interesting to note that eqs.(40) exhibit an invariance under transformations which
correspond to a duality rotation for the electric and magnetic elds and a related so(2)
rotation for the scalar elds. indeed, the transformation

(41)

other solutions of eq.(39) are those that correpond to  = 1/2, which can be obtained

by an so(2) rotation of (20) in the (x 8, x 9) plane.

iii. dynamics and boundary conditions

we shall now analyse the response of the theory to small uctuation around the static

non-bps dyon solutions that we have found above, in the spirit of ref. [3].

we take as a background the non-bps spike solution (9) and study the propagation of
a s-wave perturbation , polarized in a direction perpendicular to the brane and to x 9, say
x 8. starting from action (1), one obtains the linearized uctuation equation around the
static solution

the relation between  and x, given by (47) depends on r0 and hence only coincides with
the bps answer for r0 = 0. another important dierence with the bps case concerns the
one dimensional domain in which potential (50) is dened: being our solution a non-bps
one,  extends from a nite (negative) (0) to +, since the cusp for this solution has a
nite height x(0). now, from x 9 = x(0) to innity (i.e., in the -interval (, (0)))
the disturbance just acts on the free scalar action of the semi-innite string attached to the
brane. then, in this region, one has, instead of (49),

d2 ()
d2 = ()



(51)

we can then consider eq.(49) in the whole one dimensional domain by dening

9

vef f () = ( 0

if  <  < (0)
v () if (0) <  < 

(52)

potential (52), corresponding to a non-bps disturbed conguration, is more involved
than the bps one, which was originally studied in the   0 limit using delta function and
square barrier approximations [3], [8]. we shall take this second way and approximate the
potential by a rectangular potential, adjusting its height and width so that the integral of
v and the integral of v coincide. we then dene

s = z qv ()d , u = z v ()d

(53)

one can see, by an appropriate change of variables that neither s nor u depend on . in
terms of these quantities, one nds for the reection and transmission amplitudes

r =

exp (is2/u)
1 + (2is/u)coths
cosechs! r

t = i 2s

u

(54)

eq. (54) shows that one has complete reection with a phase-shift approaching  in the low-
energy limit (  0). computing numerically s and u one can also see that the non-bps
reection coecient |r(r0)| is slightly larger than the bps one, |r(r0)| > |r(0)|.
we thus conclude from the analysis above that a transverse disturbance on the string
attached to the non-bps brane, reects in agreement with the expected result for dirichlet
boundary conditions: the reection amplitude r goes to 1 in the low-energy (  0)
limit. in the opposite limit (  ) the potential vanishes so that the system passes from
perfectly reecting to perfectly transparent at a scale that, for the dyon background that
we studied corresponds to 8  5 + r4
m). the emerging picture is then in
agreement with the d3-brane acting as a boundary for open strings.

iv. summary and discussion

in summary we have constructed dyonic non-bps solutions to the dirac-born-infeld
action for a u(1) gauge eld in the world volume coupled to one or two scalars and analysed
them in the context of brane dynamics. although our solutions also include those bps
ones already discussed in the literature, we have concentrated on the non-bps sector to test
whether this characteristic aects the picture of strings attached to branes. one important
quantity in the analysis of the non-bps solutions is the value of the scalar charge qs which
can be written in terms of the electric and magnetic charge as

q2
s = q2

e + q2

m  (4t )2r4

0

(55)

0 > 0 our solutions correspond to a brane with a spike while for r4

for r4
0 < 0 one has
a brane-antibrane solution with a throat. the subtracted (renormalized) energy of these
non-bps dyon solutions can be arranged in a way that naturally leads to this picture of a
s (m and n being the number

brane pulled by a string with a tension t(n,m) = tqn2 + m2/g2

10

of magnetic and electric ux units of the solution). as shown graphically in fig.4, as the
scalar charge increases towards its bps value qbp s
is
exceeded, the solution becomes a pair of brane-antibrane joined by a throat. solutions with
two scalars can be constructed following analogous steps and also be interpreted in terms of
spikes extending in the combined direction of the two scalars.

, the spike grows and then, once qbp s

finally we have studied the eect of small disturbances transverse both the string and
the non-bps brane showing through a scattering analysis that the results corresponds to
the expected dirichlet boundary conditions. in particular, the reection amplitude for the
non-bps background is slighty larger than the result for the bps case and tends to 1 in
the low-energy limit.
