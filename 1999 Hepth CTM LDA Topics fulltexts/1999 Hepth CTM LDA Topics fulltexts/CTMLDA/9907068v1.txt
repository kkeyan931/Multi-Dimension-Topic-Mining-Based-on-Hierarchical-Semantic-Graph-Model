abstract

we study the lund-regge equation that governs the motion of strings in a constant

background antisymmetric tensor eld by using the duality between the lund-regge equation

and the complex sine-gordon equation. similar to the cases of vortex lament congurations

in uid dynamics, we nd various exact solitonic string congurations which are the analogue

of the kelvin wave, the hasimoto soliton and the smoke ring. in particular, using the duality

relation, we obtain a completely new type of conguration which corresponds to the breather

of the complex sine-gordon equation.

1 introduction

there has been some studies on the dynamics of a string coupled to an antisymmetric tensor

eld. such a coupling was rst introduced by kalb and ramond in the context of string

theory [1].

it also appears in the study of the relativistic motion of vortex strings in a

superuid by lund and regge [2], where the antisymmetric tensor eld induces the magnus

force acting on the vortex string by uniform uid density. in particular, lund and regge

has shown that the dynamical equation for vortex strings can be dualized to the complex

sine-gordon equation [2], and they have also found a soliton solution of the complex sine-

gordon equation. more recently, using a simple ansatz, zee found the smoke ring solution of

the lund-regge equation [3]. however, despite the dualization of the lund-regge equation

to the complex sine-gordon equation, which is exactly integrable with many known exact

solutions, nothing much is known about the exact solutions of the lund-regge equation

itself.

in the context of uid dynamics, we encounter vortex laments in an incompressible

inviscid uid [4]. the relevant dynamics of vortex laments is described in terms of variables

x(, ), which represent the vortex position where  measures the length of the vortex

lament. when we neglect both vortex mass and long range interaction, and also introduce

a short-distance cuto, the dimensionless form of the dynamical equation for the vortex

x(, ) becomes the da rios-betchov equation [5]:

x = x  x

(1)

where the dot denotes / and the prime denotes /. various exact solutons of the da

rios-betchov equation are known and their stability properties have been analyzed. among

many solutions, the kelvin wave, a helical conguration of vortex lament, and the smoke

ring solutions arise as simple cases. another interesting solution is the solitary kink wave

which propagates along a straight vortex lament line. this was rst found by hasimoto [6]

by mapping the da rios-betchov equation into the nonlinear schrodinger (nls) equation

and nding soliton solutions of the nls equation. the stability of the kelvin wave has been

also studied [7]. there are also more recent studies of this equation [8].

in the case of the lund-regge equation, the smoke ring solution found by zee suggests

that other types of solitonic solutions might exist as well. moreover, the duality between

the lund-regge and the complex sine-gordon equations implies that exact solutions, e.g.

2

solitons [2], of the complex sine-gordon equation have counterparts in the vortex system.

so far, however, explicit expressions of these solutions have not been known despite of the

dualization of the lund-regge equation to the integrable complex sine-gordon equation.

this is mainly due to the fact that the duality relation between two equations obtained by

lund and regge is incomplete. that is, their dualization is only one-directional: it allows

us to express the variables of the complex sine-gordon equation in terms of those of the

lund-regge equation but not vice versa. recently, the reverse direction has been found by

utilizing the associated linear equation of the complex sine-gordon equation, in addition

with an abstract generalization of the lund-regge equation using group theory [9].

in this paper, we analyze the lund-regge model using its dualization to the complex

sine-gordon model. the duality between these two models is explained in detail in terms

of the su(2)/u(1)-gauged wess-zumino-novikov-witten (wznw) model with a potential

term. this allows us to understand symmetries of the lund-regge model from dierent

perspectives. by making use of exact solutions of the complex sine-gordon equation, we

nd various vortex-type congurations of the lund-regge equation similar to vortex lament

congurations in uid dynamics such as the kelvin wave, the smoke ring, and the hasimoto

soliton. in particular, we obtain the breather-type vortex solution by dualizing the breather

solution of the complex sine-gordon equation.

the plan of this paper is as follows. in sec. 2, we review the lund-regge model and its

relation to the complex sine-gordon model. in sec. 3, we explain about the wess-zumino-

novikov-witten sigma model formulation of the complex sine-gordon model, and derive

exact solutions of the complex sine-gordon equation using the backlund transformation.

in sec. 4, we dualize these solutions to the congurations of vortex strings. we obtain

the smoke ring, kelvin wave, hasimoto soliton, and the breather. we conclude with some

remarks in sec. 5.

2 the lund-regge model

the dynamics of a charged particle in an external electromagnetic eld is determined by

a lorentz force acting on a particle. from the view point of a particle lagrangian, this is

done by coupling the vector gauge potential of electromagnetism to a charged particle in a

gauge invariant way. in the case of string dynamics in an external eld, the antisymmetric

tensor eld b plays the role of a gauge connection for string and the corresponding eld

3

strength (h = db) induces the magnus force acting on string. in physical applications, the

antisymmetric tensor eld is not a fundamental physical variable such as the vector gauge

potential but appears as an eective description of external elds. for example, the vortex

string in an idealized superconductor in zero temperature is described by a maxwell-higgs

system with a uniform external electric charge density [10]. in this case, the magnus force is

generated by the electric charge of the higgs eld which neutralizes the background charge.

in the following, we will not concern about any specic physical applications. instead, we

regard the antisymmetric tensor eld simply as an external eld appearing in the context of

a string theory.

the lagrangian for the string coupled to an antisymmetric tensor eld is given by

lstring = 


2

x x + bx x ,

(2)

where (, ) is the string world-sheet coordinates and  = , ;  = 0, 1, 2, 3. the string

tension is given by . here, we only consider the closed string or the innite size string
without any ends. this lagrangian is invariant under the conformal transformation    
f(  ) where f are arbitrary functions. the conformal symmetry results in a constraint
as the vanishing of the two dimensional energy-momentum tensor,

x  x + x x 

 = 0,

x x 

 = 0.

(3)

on the other hand, the classical equation for the string coming from the variation on x  is

2

x  = h xx,

(4)

where h  b+b+b is the gauge invariant eld strength of b. the magnus
force acting on the string is a stringy generalization of the lorentz force, and appears in the

literature in many disguise. in particular, lund and regge have shown that the relativistic

motion of vortices in a uniform static eld h is described precisely in this way; in a lorentz
frame in which x 0 =  , the system is governed by the gauge xed equation of motion,

(2
  2

)x i + cijk x jx k = 0,

i = 1, 2, 3

where hijk = cijk, and also by the quadratic constraints:

( x i)2 + (x i)2 = 1,

(x i)( x i) = 0.

4

(5)

(6)

here, x i(,  ); i = 1, 2, 3 are the vortex coordinates and ,  are local coordinates on the

string world-sheet. in the no-coupling limit (c = 0), this equation describes the transverse

modes of the 4-dimensional nambu-goto string in the orthonormal gauge. the critical step

leading to the integration of the vortex equation (5) and (6) is to interpret the equation as

the gauss-codazzi integrability condition for the embedding of a surface, i.e. the embedding
of the string world-sheet projected down to the x 0 =  hypersurface into the 3-dimensional
euclidean space, x 0 =  . the induced metric on the projected world-sheet is given by

ds2 = ( ~x)2d2 + 2( ~x   ~x)dd + ( ~x)2d 2,

or

ds2 = cos2 d2 + sin2 d 2,

(7)

(8)

by parameterizing ( ~x)2 = cos2 , ( ~x)2 = sin2  according to eq. (6). the unit tangent
vectors, ~n1 and ~n2, spanning the plane tangent to the surface, and the unit normal vector
~n3 consisting a moving frame are given by

~n1 =

1
| ~x|

 ~x,

~n2 =

 ~x,

~n3 =

1
| ~x|

1

| ~x   ~x|

 ~x   ~x.

(9)

the vectors ( ~ni; i = 1, 2, 3), given coordinates u1, u2 on the surface, satisfy the equation of
gauss and weingarten (with a = 1, 2):

 ~na
ub

= c
ab

~nc + lab ~n3,

 ~n3
ua

= gablbc ~nc,

(10)

where c

ab are the christoel symbols and the lab are the components of the extrinsic curva-
ture tensor. they are a set of overdetermined linear equations and the consistency of which

requires the gauss-codazzi equation:

rabcd = laclbd  ladlbc, lab;c = lac;b,

(11)

where the semicolon denotes covariant dierentiation on the surface and rabcd are the com-

ponents of its riemann tensor. from eq. (11), it follows that there exists a eld  such

that

l12 = cot 


u2

,

1
2

(l11 + l22) = cot 


u1

.

(12)

z = (   )/2 and make the
we introduce the light-cone coordinates z = ( +  )/2,
coordinate transformation: z  z/, z  z, under which the gauss-codazzi equation is

5

invariant due to its lorentz invariance. in this case, the gauss-weingarten equation in the

spin-1/2 representation becomes the linear equation of the inverse scattering [11]:

 = (u0 + u1),

 = (v0 + 1v1),

where

u0 + u1 = (cid:18) ic/4 + i cos 2/2 sin2 
4 (cid:18)c cos 2/  2 / sin2 
v0 + 1v1 = 

 + i cot 

c sin 2/

i

 + i cot 
c sin 2/

ic/4  i cos 2/2 sin2 (cid:19) ,
c cos 2/ + 2 / sin2 (cid:19) .

the integrability condition of the overdetermined linear equation in eq. 13),

[ + u0 + u1,  + v0 + 1v1] = 0,

then becomes the complex sine-gordon equation:

c2
2

sin 2 +

  
(cot2  ) + (cot2  ) = 0.

  = 0,

cos 
sin3 

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

this reduces to the well-known sine-gordon equation when  = 0.

3 the complex sine-gordon model

since its rst introduction by lund and regge as explained in the previous section, and
also independently by pohlmeyer [12] in the context of the reduced nonlinear sigma model1,

the complex sine-gordon model has been studied extensively. there exists a lagrangian of

the complex sine-gordon equation (29) in terms of  and  which however is singular at

specic values of . this singularity problem has been resolved beautifully by identifying

the complex sine-gordon model with the integrably deformed su(2)/u(1)-coset conformal

model [17]. the relevant action in general is given by a g/h-gauged wznw action plus a

potential term which accounts for an integrable deformation as follows [18];

i = iw zn w (g, a, a)  ip (g, t, t )

1eq. (5) can be shown to be dual to the nonlinear sigma model [13], which itself is also
integrable [14, 15, 16]. the vortex motion can be studied along this line. however, one
has to impose the constraint (6) later on, which is quite a nontrivial task. in fact, this
is why the gauged wznw model is an appropriate framework where the constraints are
taken care of through the u (1)-gauging

(17)

6

where iw zw (g, a, a) is the usual gauged wznw action for the g/h-coset conformal eld
theory [19] with a map g : m  g of a lie group g dened on two-dimensional minkowski
space m and gauge connections a and a which gauge the anormaly free subgroup h  g.
the deformation potential term is given in terms of t and t ,

ip (g, t, t ) =



2 z tr(gt g1 t ),

(18)

where  is a mass parameter and t and t belong belong to the center of the subalgebra
h  g, i.e. [t, h] = [ t, h] = 0. the gauged coset action iw zn w (g, a, a) is characterized by
the classical equation of motion,

g(iw zn w +ip ) =

1

2 z tr ([  + a,  +g1g +g1ag]+[ t, g1 t g ] )g1g = 0, (19)

and the constraint equation resulting from the variation of i with respect to a, a

ai =

 ai =

1

2 z tr((  gg1 + g ag1  a )a) = 0,
2 z tr(( g1g + g1ag  a ) a) = 0 .

1

or,

(  gg1 + g ag1  a )h = 0,

( g1g + g1ag  a)h = 0,

(20)

(21)

where the subscript h species the projection to the subalgebra h. it can be readily checked

that these constraint equations, when combined with eq. (19), imply the atness of the
connection a and a, i.e.

fz z = [  + a ,  + a ] = 0 .

(22)

this atness condition together with the vector gauge invariance of the action i allow us to
set a = a = 0 so that the constraint equation simplies to

(g1g)h = 0, ( gg1)h = 0.

using the identity,

(g1 t g) + [ g1g , g1 t g ] = 0,

the equation of motion can be written as a zero curvature condition

[  + g1g + t ,  +

g1 t g ] = 0 ,

1


7

(23)

(24)

(25)

where  is an arbitrary spectral parameter. in turn, this zero curvature condition can be

understood as the integrability condition of the linear system

( + u) = 0 ,

(  + v ) = 0,

(26)

where u  u0 + u1 = g1g + t and v  1

v1 = 1

g1 t g.

now we restrict to the complex sine-gordon case where the coset g/h is su(2)/u(1).

for g  su(2) element, we parametrize g by
i1  uuei

g = (cid:18)

u

i1  uuei

u

(cid:19) ,

(27)

and take pauli matrices i as generators of g. also, we assume that t =  t = i3. then,
the gauge constraint (23) can be written as

0 =

0 =

uu  uu
4(1  uu) 
u u  u u
4(1  uu) 

i
2
i
2

,

,

(28)

which may be used to bring eq. (25) into a more conventional form of the complex sine-

gordon equation,

 u +

 u +

uu u
1  uu + 4u(1  uu) = 0,
uu u
1  uu + 4u(1  uu) = 0.

(29)

by writing u = cos  exp(i), one can readily see that this equation indeed agrees with eq.

(16). the zero curvature condition in eq. (15) also agrees with eq. (25) up to u(1)-vector

gauge transformation. since the complex sine-gordon equation and the vortex equation are
both invariant under the vector gauge transformation, we adhere to the gauge, a = a = 0

for simplicity for the rest of the paper.

having formulated the complex sine-gordon equation as the integrability condition of the

linear equation, we may obtain the backlund transformation of the complex sine-gordon

equation which generates a new solution from a given solution as follows; if (f, f ) is a

solution of the linear equation such that

( + f 1f + t )f = 0 ,

(  +

f 1 t f )f = 0,

g1g  f 1f  q|| [ g13f , 3 ] = 0,
 (g13f ) +q|| g13g q|| f 13f = 0.

(31)

(32)

(33)

a new set of solution (g, g) is given by

with an arbitrary parameter , provided that g and f satisfy the backlund transformation,

specically, we will be concerned about the following four distinct types of solutions of

the complex sine-gordon equation, which we dualize later to the vortex solutions. first,

we consider the trivial vacuum case. for  < 0 which we assume below without loss of

generality, the vacuum solution is given by

case a:

f = 1, u = 1,

 = f = (cid:18) eiz+iz/

0

0

eiziz/(cid:19) .

(34)

note that  can be of any value so that the vacuum has an unbroken u(1)-symmetry.

a less trivial solution can be obtained if we make an assumption of the constant magni-

tude of u, i.e. |u| = ,
case b:

u =  exp i(2  1)(z 
 = 2(z +

z


),

z


)! , 0   < 1,

(35)

where  and  are arbitrary constants. the linear function f will be found later when we

consider the corresponding vortex solution.

in order to obtain the one soliton solution, we need to apply the backlund transformation

to the vacuum solution (case a) and impose the gauge constraint. for  < 0 and f = 1,

the components of eq.(33) reduce to

u + 2q(1  uu) = 0,
u 
(1  uu) = 0,

2



(36)

and their complex conjugates. these equations may be readily integrated to yield the 1-

soliton solution,

case c:

u =  cos  tanh(cid:18)2q cos (z 
 = 2q sin (z +

z


),

z


)(cid:19)  i sin ,

(37)

9

where cos  and sin  (   < ) are constants of integration and

z = 

1
8

( + ), z = 


8

(  ).

(38)

note that this soliton solution reduces to the famous sine-gordon kink solution when  = 0.
when  6= 0, the above soliton becomes nontopological and carries an extra conserved u(1)-
charge [20, 21]. in particular, if  = /2, it simply reduces to the vacuum solution. thus,

the 1-soliton in eq. (37) interpolates between the topological kink and the vacuum solution.

two-soliton solution and the breather solution can be obtained by the following nonlin-

ear superposition rule; let g1 and g2 be a pair of one soliton solutions obtained through the

backlund transformation applied to the trivial solution f = 1, with parameters of trans-

formation 1 and 2 respectively. then, by taking a successive application of the backlund

transformation to each one-solitons but with parameters reversed, i.e. 2 and 1, and requir-

ing the commutability of each processes we obtain a nonlinearly superposed solution g3 such

that

g3 = 3(2g1  1g2)g1

0 3(1g1

1  2g1

2 )1.

(39)

this superposed solution in general describes the scattering of two solitons. for example,
it describes a soliton-soliton scattering if 1 = 1/2, and a soliton-antisoliton scattering
if 1 = 1/2 for real 1 and 2. if we assume 1 and 2 to be unit complex numbers such
that 1 = 1/2 =  with || = 1, we obtain a breather solution of the complex sine-gordon
equation [21]. here, for simplicity, we consider only the breather of the sine-gordon equation

which arises as a special case of breathers of the complex sine-gordon equation by considering

the superposition of topological solitons. in our notation, if we denote

gi = exp(i2i);

i = 1, 2, 3,

(40)

where 1 = 2 tan1 exp(2(z z/)), 2 = 2 tan1 exp(2(z + z/)), the breather

solution is given by

case d:

u = cos 3,  =


2

,

3 = tan1

(2  1/2) sin(1  2)
(2 + 1/2) cos(1  2)  2

.

(41)

in the next section, vortex conguration corresponding to these solutions will be constructed.

10

4 dualization and vortex solutions

in sec. 2, the vortex model of lund and regge has been dualized to the the complex sine-

gordon model by writing the complex sine-gordon variables in terms of vortex coordinate

variables and showing that the vortex equation implies the complex sine-gordon equation.

the reverse direction, i.e. writing the vortex variables in terms of the complex sine-gordon

variables, was not known in the original work by lund and regge, and has been completed

only recently [9]. this can be stated easily in terms of the associated linear equations in eq.

(26) as follows; let (z, z, ) be a solution of the linear equation of the complex sine-gordon

model. then, the matrix f dened by

f  1




 = 1 
t

; (t  ln )

results in the vortex coordinate through

f  

3

xi=1

ixii,

(42)

(43)

up to some normalization constant . in order to prove that these xi indeed satisfy the

vortex equation as well as the constraint equation, we rst compute that

f = 11 

t

 + 1 
t

() = 1 u

t

 = 1u1.

(44)

in a similar way, we nd that f = 1

1v1. this shows that the constraint equation is

automatically satised,

tr(f )2 = 22(x)2 = 222, tr( f )2 = 22( x)2 = 

2
2 ,

up to some rescaling to be determined later. since

u
t
v
t
we note that the compatibility condition:  f = f requires that

f = (1 u
 f = (1 v

, v ]  
, u]  

u
t
v
t

) = 1([

) = 1([

t

t

),

),

v  u + [u, v ] = [ + u ,  + v ] = 0.

(45)

(46)

(47)

this is just the zero curvature equation (25) which holds when the complex sine-gordon

equation is satised. thus, one can nd such a matrix f for any given solution of the

11

complex sine-gordon equation. in particular, the rst order term in  in the zero curvature
expression yields  u1 = 0. using this fact in eq. (46), it is easy to verify that

f = 1[u1, v1] = [f , f ].

in terms of the component as in eq. (43), this reduces precisely to the vortex equation

2
 xi  2

xi  ijk xjxk = 0,

when we rescale world-sheet coordinates and x the constant  in the following way;

z

.

more explicitly, xi are given by

xi =

4i


fi(cid:16)z = 

1
8

( + ), z = 


8

(  )(cid:17).

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

thus, the vortex coordinate xi can be obtained explicitly by solving the associate linear

equation of the complex sine-gordon equation, thereby completing the dualization procedure.

besides the duality between the equations, the dualization of the two models in terms of

an integrably deformed gauged wznw action provides dualities between the global prop-

erties, e.g.

symmetries of the model. since the vortex model in our case is relativistic,

it possesses world-sheet lorentz invariance, and also a discrete symmetry under the inter-
change    . this obviously contrasts with the usual case of vortex equation in uid
dynamics in eq. (1) where the discrete symmetry is absent. in the context of the deformed

wznw action, the discrete symmetry corresponds to the parity symmetry under the action
g  g, z  z where  is a generator which anti-commutes with 3.

another important symmetry comes from the symmetry of the linear equation in eq.
(26) under the action (, z, z)  (, z, z) () for any arbitrary matrix function ().
this induces the rotational and the translational transformation of vortex coordinates such

that

f  ()1f () +  ()1 d ()

d

.

(52)

the local u(1)-gauge symmetry of the deformed gauged wznw action does not contribute

to the vortex model. under the u(1)-gauge transformation, f as dened in eq. (42) is gauge
invariant. thus, in the following, we x the gauge via the gauge constraint: (g1g)h =
( gg1)h = 0 and compute vortex solutions by dualizing solutions (cases a-d in sec. 3) of

the complex sine-gordon equation.

12

4.1 case a: straight line

calculating f using f in eq. (34), we have f = i3(z  z/). thus, eq. (51) gives
rise to x1 = x2 = 0, x3 = , which describes a straight line. this straight line can be
mapped to any other line through the symmetry action in eq. (52).

4.2 case b: kelvin wave and smoke ring

the smoke ring solution in uid dynamics has the form,

x = (a( ) cos(c), a( ) sin(c), b( )) .

(53)

note that when a( ) is a constant, this arises as a special case of a kelvin wave in uid

dynamics of the form,

x = (a cos(k   ), a sin(k   ), b) ,

(54)

if we interchange  and  using the discrete symmetry and x k = 0.

now, we show that the vortex solution corresponding to case b has the form of a kelvin

wave. first, in order to solve for  with the solution u and  in eq. (35), we dene a new
variable   1

0  where

0 = (cid:18) exp( i

its motion during 7 <  < 7 moving along the z-axis. fig. 1-(c) shows smoke rings at
 = 0, 10, ..., 40, 50. it shows that the surface swept out by a smoke ring is a cylinder. the

straight line of case a is thus a limiting case where the ring shrinks to a point.

4.3 case c: soliton

one of the well-known vortex congurations is the solitary kink wave which propagates along

a straight vortex lament line. this was rst found by hasimoto [6] using the duality be-

tween the da rios-betchov equation and the nonlinear schrodinger equation. this hasimoto

soliton, which was obtained by dualizing the nls soliton, has the form,

x = asech(   ) (cos(   ), sin(   ), 0) + (0, 0, b  a tanh(   )) .

(65)

in the present case of the lund-regge model, a similar conguration can be found also by

dualizing the soliton of the complex sine-gordon equation as given in case c. in order to

do so, we rst compute  by using the backlund transformation in eq. (31) applied to the

vacuum (f = 1) so that

which has the same form with the hasimoto soliton in uid dynamics.

4.4 breather vortex

the breather solution of the sine-gordon equation is presumably the most well-known con-

guration in soliton theories as a stable localized solution except solitons. our dualization

procedure suggests that we can also have a counterpart of a breather in vortex dynamics.

as far as we know, such a conguration is not known in vortex dynamics literatures. in

order to construct the solution explicitly, we use the bt in eq. (31) to nd  of the linear

equation (26),

where y = z  z
 . this gives a breather vortex solution after using the relation in
eq. (51). figure 3 describes breather vortex congurations and the embedded surface. fig.

3-(a) shows an open-string type breather vortex with  = 0. fig. 3-(b) a breather vortex

conguration with  = 0, and fig. 3-(c) shows an embedded surface. note that fig. 3-(a)

shows a cusp at  = 0. however, this does not cause any physical singularity which may be

seen by checking the derivatives of vortex coordinates with respect to  at  = 0. explicit

calculation shows that they behave regularly at  = 0. in fact, this cusp-like behavior arises

since we have restricted to the breather of the sine-gordon equation which arises as a special

case of breather solutions of the complex sine-gordon equation.

instead of proving this

in terms of detailed solutions, here we only content that breather solutions obtained from
solitons with  6= 0 do not possess this cusp-like behavior. besides, we may expect that this

new type vortex conguration is stable since it arises from dualizing a breather solution of

the complex sine-gordon equation which is stable. however, this has to yet to be seen.

5 discussion

in this paper, we have found various vortex congurations of the lund-regge model by

making use of the duality between the lund-regge equation and the complex sine-gordon

equation. we have shown that these vortices have analogous counterparts in the vortex

system of uid dynamics. in fact, these correspondence arise from the fact that the usual

uid vortex equation is a nonrelativistic limit of the lund-regge equation. this may be

also seen in their dualized versions, i.e. the nonlinear schrodinger equation which dualizes

the vortex equation in uid dynamics also arises as a nonrelativistic limit of the sine-gordon

equation, which itself is a special case of the complex sine-gordon equation. the exact

correspondence of these equations will be considered elsewhere.

another important problem would be the quantization of the system.

in view of the

string formulation of the system by lund and regge, the quantization of the present case

would be a stringy generalization of the landau levels of a charged particle moving on

a uniform magnetic eld. the magnetic ux vortex in the maxwell higgs system with a

uniform magnetic eld, for exampe, can be quantized consistently. it would be interesting

to know whether the duality between the lund-regge model and the complex sine-gordon

model persists at the quantum level.
