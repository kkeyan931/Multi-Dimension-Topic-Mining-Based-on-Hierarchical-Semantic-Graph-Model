abstract. su (n ) yang-mills integrals form a new class of matrix models which,
in their maximally supersymmetric version, are relevant to recent non-perturbative
denitions of 10-dimensional iib superstring theory and 11-dimensional m-theory. we
demonstrate how monte carlo methods may be used to establish important properties
of these models. in particular we consider the partition functions as well as the matrix
eigenvalue distributions. for the latter we derive a number of new exact results for
su (2). we also report preliminary computations of wilson loops.

yang-mills integrals

1. motivation

2

recently there has been considerable interest in dimensionally reduced yang-mills
theories as a means to obtain non-perturbative information on superstring theory and
m-theory. the possible relevance of these systems to quantum gravity appeared in [1]
through the light cone quantization of the 11-dimensional supermembrane. it was argued
in [1] that 10-dimensional su(n) super yang-mills theory reduced to one dimension 
i.e. matrix quantum mechanics  correctly quantizes the supermembrane in the large n
limit. the very same system, rst studied (without reference to applications to quantum
gravity) in [2], has recently been interpreted as a non-perturbative attempt at m-theory
[3]. unfortunately, on the technical side, very little is known about this model: it is
suspected [1], [3] that a novel, intricate large n limit is required, but only few concrete
results are available. this motivates the study of a simpler system: the complete
reduction of yang-mills theory to 0 + 0 dimensions. in addition, the reduction of the
ten-dimensional susy gauge theory path integral to a matrix integral has been at the
heart of an alternative proposal to directly dene non-perturbative iib string theory [4].
more generally we may study the complete reduction of d-dimensional su(n) yang-
mills theory. then the path integral of the eld theory simplies to an integral over
the groups lie algebra, with a at measure: a yang-mills integral. denoting the gauge
potential by x a

 and their superpartners by a

 we obtain

the a priori allowed dimensions for the reduced supersymmetric gauge theory are
d = 3, 4, 6, 10 corresponding to n = 2, 4, 8, 16 real supersymmetries. for the bosonic,
i.e. the non-supersymmetric case n = 0, we omit the grassmann variables a
 , and may
study all dimensions d  2.

there are numerous further reasons for being interested in the integrals eq.(1):
 the susy integrals are crucial for the computation of the witten index of the above
mentioned quantum mechanical gauge theories, as they contribute to the so-called bulk
part of the index [5] (cf also [6] for an earlier calculation).

 in the maximally supersymmetric case, the system describes to leading order the

statistical distribution of a system of n d-instantons (or 1-branes).

 the n = 16 integral appears in very recent work developing a multi-instanton
calculus for the n = 4, d = 4 su() conformal gauge theory [7], and again in the
large n limit of sp(n) and so(n) n = 4 susy gauge theory [8].

 finally we can regard the integrals eq.(1) as a version of the eguchi-kawai reduced
gauge theory. the original work [9] focused on a lattice formulation and employed
unitary matrices, while the above integrals use the hermitean gauge connections x a
 .

yang-mills integrals

this is similar to [10]; however, we apply neither gauge xing nor quenching prescriptions
to the above integrals. the interesting question is whether the models eq.(1) encode
universal information on the full gauge eld theory as n  .
the integrals of eq.(1) appear to be singular due to the valleys of the action,
i.e. the directions in the conguration space of the x a
 where all d matrices commute.
recent work has however proven this intuition wrong: yang-mills integrals do exist in
many interesting cases.

2. partition functions: convergence properties and some exact results

indeed, the rigorous results of [5] (see also [6]) show that for the gauge group su(2) the
susy integrals converge in dimensions d = 4, 6, 10. the calculations are easily repeated
for the bosonic case [11], and the convergence condition d  5 is found. unfortunately,
no rigorous methods exist to date for higher rank gauge groups n  3.

in [11], [12],[13] we developed methods to numerically test convergence of singular
multidimensional integrals. the idea is to perform a metropolis random walk weighted
by the integrand, and to merely measure the autocorrelation function of subsequent
congurations. in this approach, a unit autocorrelation function signals the presence of
a nonintegrable singularity.

as an illustration we plot in fig.1 the autocorrelation function of the su(2) bosonic

integrals.

fig. 1 autocorrelation functions versus monte carlo time for the su(2) bosonic integral
with, from the left, d = 3, 4, 5.

we are clearly able to reproduce the convergence condition d  5: for d = 5
the congurations decorrelate well and the whole integration space is properly sampled.
(one observes increasingly improved decorrelation for d = 6, 7, . . ., not shown in fig.1.)
in contrast for d = 3 the system gets quickly trapped in a singular conguration: the
markov chain gets lost in a valley, and the integral is divergent. d = 4 shows marginal
divergence, which agrees with the exact analytical results.

yang-mills integrals

applying the same method to higher

rank bosonic models, and to the
supersymmetric models, we are able to map out the convergence conditions for the
yang-mills integrals. they read

d = 4, 6, 10

and

d = 3

d = 4

in particular the d = 3 susy integral is divergent (see [11],[12],[13] for a more detailed
discussion of this point).

it would be nice to have a rigorous mathematical proof of the conditions (3). some
understanding may be gained by considering one-loop perturbative estimates of the
integrals eq.(1). one has for the supersymmetric case [14]

d,n  z

where the xi

 are the diagonal components of the matrices x a

powercounting for large separations (xi  xj)2 yields precisely eq.(3). however,
it
should be stressed that this does not prove the convergence conditions, since one has
to worry about congurations where some separations are small, so that the one-loop
approximation becomes invalid.

in the supersymmetric case the value for the integrals is believed to be known:

the n = 16 expression was conjectured by green and gutperle [16] based on a
calculation of the d-instanton eective action of the superstring. a derivation of the
terms to the right of the curly bracket in eq.(6), based on cohomological deformation
techniques, was given in [17]. this calculation has still an important loophole (see
comments in [13]). however, the formula eq.(6) was numerically checked by monte
carlo techniques in [11],[12] up to n  5.

for the bosonic case no exact value of the partition function is known except for

su(2) [11], where the result reads

it would be exciting to nd the generalization of this result to higher rank gauge
groups  this is after all the zero-mode contribution to the yang-mills partition
function on a d-dimensional torus.

3. eigenvalue densities: asymptotics and the exact su(2) densities

let us shift attention from the partition functions to the correlation functions of the
models. the simplest correlators are su(n) invariant one-matrix correlators:
the
moments htr x k
di of one matrix, say the d-th: xd. these are directly related to
the distribution of eigenvalues of the matrix: if the eigenvalues of xd are 1, . . . , n ,
the eigenvalue density is dened for all n as

() = h

1
n

n

xi=1

(  i)i.

the non-zero moments of () are then given by

(8)

(9)

d 1

d e = z 



d() 2k

in an ordinary wigner type matrix model all moments exist. yang-mills integrals are
more intricate. analytical calculations have only been performed for su(2), and we
in the d = 4 susy integral all moments are
found the following surprising results.
innite, even though the integral itself exists, as argued above.
in the d = 6 susy
integral the rst two moments are nite and one nds

htr x 2

did=6 =

did=6 =

(10)

while all higher moments diverge. for the d = 10 susy integral we have exactly twelve
nite moments which are

it would be interesting to nd a geometrical or combinatorial interpretation for these
numbers. which densities give rise to this convergence behavior? for su(2) we can go
farther and nd the exact densities:

now we see that the above niteness properties of the moments result from a rather
curious powerlike behavior of the densities at large values of . we have for

d = 4

d = 6

d = 10

(14)

this power-like behavior is very dierent from wigner type systems where the fall-o at
innity is at least exponential. for the d-dimensional bosonic models the density can
be worked out as well albeit less explicitly than in eqs.(12), and one nds the asymptotic
behavior d()  3d.

moving on to higher values of n, we are unable to analytically calculate the
eigenvalue densities with presently known techniques. we can, however, nd numerically
exact densities using monte carlo methods. in fig.2 we illustrate this by plotting the
n = 2, 3, 4 d = 4 susy half-densities (we only plot the   0 part since the densities are
symmetric functions). in the su(2) case the exact expression of eq.(12) and the monte
carlo data cannot be separated on the scale of the gure.

now we would like to know how the su(2) result eq.(14) generalizes to other values
of n. it is impossible to extract the asymptotics from histograms such as fig.2, since the
tails comprise only a small number of samples. instead, we can go back to the markov-
chain technique of the last section and measure the niteness of the moments eq.(9)
for various values of n. we nd that for the susy integrals the qualitative behavior of
the su(2) case persists: in the d = 4, 6, 10 integrals only the rst, respectively, 0, 2, 12
moments are nite. we thus conclude, in view of eq.(9), that the asymptotic behavior
eq.(14) is valid for all n. this is very dierent from wigner type random matrix models,
where as n increases, the density condenses onto a compact interval. at the sharply
dened (at n = ) edge of the interval wigner distributions show universal behavior.
we have argued that in susy yang-mills matrix models no such edge exists, indicating
that the large n physics of these models is indeed very dierent.

let us furthermore compare supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric yang-mills
integrals. how does the asymptotic behavior of the density eq.(14) change in the absence
of susy? we have already mentioned above that for su(2) this behavior is powerlike as
well. actually we can guess a general formula by looking once more at the eective one-
loop estimate of eq.(5). for one-matrix correlators the most dangerous conguration
stems from pulling away one coordinate xi
d from a bulk conguration of all other d  1
coordinates. powercounting leads to the guess

d()  2n (d2)+3d5

where

n >

(15)

d
d  2

the same procedure applied to the susy estimate eq.(4) reproduces eq.(14). we then
veried the validity of eq.(15) by the same monte carlo random walk procedure as
above, measuring the niteness of moments. we thus notice a marked dierence to the
susy situation: in the bosonic case all moments exist as n   for all d  3.
in
particular we expect the eigenvalue distribution to condense onto a compact support,
much like for wigner type models.

4. wilson loops: preliminary results

a further natural set of correlation functions of yang-mills matrix integrals are wilson
loops. due to the eguchi-kawai mechanism [9],[10], one naively expects them to
correspond at n =  to wilson loops in the unreduced gauge eld theory.
in the
proposal of [4] for a non-perturbative denition of the iib superstring, they have been
interpreted as string creation operators [18].

despite the dimensional reduction of the eld theory to zero dimensions we are still
able to dene an innite set of independent wilson loops dependent on an arbitrary
contour c in d-dimensional euclidean space:

w(c) = h

dyxi

(16)

1

n p tr eihc

yang-mills integrals

8

due to the non-commutative nature of the connections x and the path-ordering p,
this is a non-trivial functional of the contour c despite the fact that the x are spacially
in the special case of a rectangular contour with lengths l and t in the
constant.
(y1, yd) plane this simplies to

w(l, t ) = h

1
n

tr eilx1eit xd eilx1eit xdi

(17)

we would like to understand how the loops w behave as a function of n and as a
functional of the shape of the contours, in particular whether planar loops satisfy an
area-law. we would also like to see whether there are any telltale dierences between
the supersymmmetric and the bosonic loops.

in the previous sections we have shown how a number of exact results may be
derived for the simplest gauge group su(2). we have not been able to analytically
calculate a wilson loop for an yang-mills integral even for su(2). on the other hand
it is possible to obtain high precision numerical results for low values of n. in fig.3a
we plot the wilson loop for a square (l = t ) in the case of susy d = 4 as a function of
l for various values of n.

bottom) (b) square, regular 16-gon and 64-gon enclosed in circle of radius r with n = 4.

the behavior for small area is easy to understand. indeed, for an arbitrary planar
loop enclosing a small area of size a, it is straightforward to show, using stokes theorem,
that w(c) = 1 + 1

2n a2htr[x1, x2]2i + o(x 6). this immediately gives

and agrees to high precision with the numerical data. a very curious feature of fig.3a
is that the loops tend to a constant for large area. the existence of this constant can be
demonstrated analytically. it should be considered a nite n artifact for the following
reasons: (a) the constant decreases with n, as seen in fig.3a. (b) the constant depends

w(c) =

in various ways on the shape of the contour. we checked that by distorting the rectangle
to a slightly irregular quadrangle the constant drops to zero for all n as the size increases.
in fig3.b we show various regular polygons approximating a circle of radius r: as we
increase the number of edges the constant goes to zero for large r.

it is clear from the mentioned features of the wilson loops that there is an area
law neither for very small nor very large areas. an intermediate region in which an area
law holds might still be present. we checked, by going to rather larger n, that this is
not the case for the bosonic models. there has been an interesting suggestion [19] that
such an intermediate region may exist for the d = 4 supersymmetric model.

5. conclusions and outlook

we showed how numerical markov chain methods can be used to verify non-perturbative
convergence conditions for yang-mills integrals with and without supersymmetry. the
same methods may be applied to establish the convergence properties of correlation
functions. applying the technique to invariant correlators of a single matrix, we are
able to accurately predict the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalue density of yang-
mills matrix models. the results demonstrate an unusual powerlaw behavior which, in
the supersymmetric cases, persists for large n. this indicates that the large n limit
of these new matrix models might indeed be very dierent from the one of the old
wigner type models. we also demonstrated that monte carlo methods are capable to
rather accurately compute various quantities relevant to these models such as partition
functions, correlation functions, spectral distributions and wilson loops. as opposed
to yang-mills quantum mechanics [2],[1],[3] we are confronted to a system which allows
some non-perturbative analysis, at least for nite n.

yang-mills integrals are thus an ideal

laboratory for exploring new large n
techniques. powerful analytical methods will have to be developed if we are to verify or,
maybe more importantly, if we are to bring to good use the ideas presented in [1],[3],[4].
