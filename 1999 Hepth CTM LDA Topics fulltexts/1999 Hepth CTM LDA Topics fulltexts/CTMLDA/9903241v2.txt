abstract

we consider the inclusion of brane charges in ads5 superalgebras that contain the
maximal central extension of the super-poincare algebra on ads5. for theories with
n supersymmetries on the boundary, the maximal extension is osp(1/8n, r), which

contains the group sp(8n, r)  u(2n, 2n)  su(2, 2)  u(n) as extension of the
conformal group. an intermediate extension to u(2n, 2n/1) is also discussed,
as well as the inclusion of brane charges in ads7 and ads4 superalgebras. bps
conditions in the presence of brane charges are studied in some details.

1 introduction

it is well known that the classication of superalgebras, containing the anti-de sitter i.e.

conformal superalgebra has a barrier at dimension d = 7 [1]. this result is based on the
assumption that the bosonic subalgebra of the superalgebra is the direct product of the

conformal algebra o(d  1, 2) with an internal symmetry group g. this classication can be
viewed, essentially, as an extension of the haag-lopuszanski-sohnius theorem [2] for d > 4.

on the other hand, in dynamical theories with extended objects, it is already known that
the super-poincare algebras do include, in any dimension, central charges [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] which

at rst sight violate the above assumption.

it is then natural to consider the same generalization when such charges of rank p are
introduced in the ads superalgebra rather than in its poincare counterpart. such extension

has been studied in the literature with the goal of constructing an eleven-dimensional theory in
ads space [8, 9], or a conformal theory in ten dimensions [6].

the result of these investigations is that the conformal extension of the d = 10 n = 1

poincare superalgebra is osp(1/32, r), in which sp(32, r)  o(10, 2).

in the present paper, we consider a similar extension in the context of ads5 supergravity. the
dierence here is that ads5 superalgebras already exist. in the absence of p-brane charge, they
correspond to the usual superconformal algebras u(2, 2/n), which occur in the classication
of haag, lopuszanski and sohnius (hls) [2]. we consider here the ads5 superalgebra in the
presence of ads p-branes, and we show that, for any n-extended supergravity, such algebra

is osp(1/8n), with the conformal group o(4, 2)  su(2, 2) embedded as follows in the real
symplectic group sp(8n, r) [10]:

sp(8n, r)  u(2n, 2n)  su(2, 2)  u(n).

(1)

extensions of conformal superalgebras in d = 5 have been considered also in ref. [11], where
worldsheet superalgebras for d5-branes in an ads5 background were proposed. ref. [11] shows,
among other things, that, in the presence of p-brane charges, the world-sheet superconformal
group of a d3-brane in ads5, u(2, 2/4), is extended to osp(1/32).

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we consider the standard superalgebras in
the 5-d minkowski space, m5, and in ads5, and view them as the starting blocks for further
investigations. in section 3 we consider the osp(1/8n) algebras as algebras in ads5 in the
presence of ads p-branes. in section 4 we give a general, algebraic analysis of the bps condition
in ads5, and, in particular, we study the pattern of r-parity breaking induced by bps p-branes.
in section 5 we present an extension of the analysis performed in sections 3 and 4 to ads7.
section 6 contains a brief description of an additional intermediate conformal extension of

1

the 5-d super-poincare algebra, a comment on the uniqueness of such extensions, and a brief
analysis of ads4 superalgebras and their 1/2 bps brane congurations.

2 maximal central extensions of poincare superalge-

bras

the maximal central extension of the poincare superalgebra with n spinorial components of the
supersymmetry charges gives an algebra with n(n+ 1)/2 bosonic central charges 3, including the
space-time translations. examples of such extensions are the n = 1 superalgebra in d = 11
dimensions, in the presence of two- and ve-brane charges, and the iia and iib algebras in ten

dimensions, in the presence of ns and r brane charges [3, 4, 5, 6].

when the space-time dimension is suciently low, the maximal central extensions include

also bps domain walls and bps instantons, as it becomes obvious if one regards such algebras
obtained by dimensional reduction. it is relevant to this paper to recall the central extensions

in dimensions d = 4, 5, because they will play an important role when the analogous ve-
dimensional superalgebra will be considered in ads5, and m4 will be interpreted as its boundary.
the n-extended poincare superalgebra in d = 5, with maximal central extension, has a

usp(2n) r-symmetry [12], and it reads

{qa

 , qb

 } = (c)pab + (c)z o [ab]



+ cz [ab] + (c)z (ab)



,

(2)

where z o [ab]

abz o [ab]



= 0) and z (ab)



, z [ab] are in the antisymmetric of usp(2n) (z o [ab]



is also symplectic-traceless:

is in the adjoint of usp(2n).

the standard hls [2] algebra is obtained by setting z o [ab]



= z (ab)

 = 0. these charges

come from strings and membranes.

3 anti-de sitter and conformal superalgebras

the anti-de sitter superalgebra is a modication of the poincare superalgebra given in eq. (2),
where p, m span the algebra of o(4, 2), and generators of u(n) are included.

this is the ads5 superalgebra u(2, 2/n). this superalgebra can be formally obtained by

decomposing usp(2n)  su(n)  u(1) in the former algebra:

{qa

 , qb } = (c)pa

b + (c)ma

b + (c)z o a

 b + (c)z o a

 b + cu a
b ,

{qa

 , qb

 } = (c)z [ab]

 + cz [ab] + (c)z (ab)



,

c.c., ,  = 0, .., 4.

(3)

(4)

3more precisely, they are bosonic central charges of the supertranslation algebra, which is a subalgebra of the

super-poincare algebra.

setting to zero all bosonic generators except p, m and u a
b , and promoting them to the (non-
commutative) generators of the su(2, 2)  u(n) lie algebra, with the fermionic generators in
the (4, n) + (4, n) representation, the algebra becomes

{qa

b + (c)m + cu a
b ,

 , qb } = (c)pa

 } = {qa , qb } = 0.

(6)

this is the standard ads5 superalgebra considered in the literature. if realized on the four-
dimensional boundary, it corresponds to the hls superconformal algebra in d = 4, which is

the conformal extension of the poincare superalgebra without central charges.

let us now consider whether an ads5 superalgebra exists with non-vanishing z generators.

the z should correspond somehow to brane charges in ads5.

the ads5 extension of the poincare superalgebra with charges given in eqs. (3,4) is imme-
diate. namely, the z generators in eqs. (3,4) complete the superalgebra osp(1/8n, r). the
su(2, 2)  u(n) generators are embedded as follows in sp(8n, r):

sp(8n, r)  u(2n, 2n)  su(2, 2)  u(n).

(7)

as it is well known [9], the sp(8n, r) algebra has a three-grading with respect to the dilation

generator, r in the decomposition su(2, 2)  sl(2, c)  r. here, sl(2, c) is the lorentz
group of the boundary of ads5. indeed,

lsp(8n ) = l1 + l0 + l1,

(8)

where l1 contains p and all (dimension-1) central charges of the 4-d super-poincare algebra.
l1 contains k and all (dimension 1) special-conformal central charges, while

l0 = sl(4n, r)  r

(9)

is the lie algebra which contains, among others, the generators of the lorentz group on ads5,
and u(n) [10]:

sl(4n, r)  sl(2n, c)  u(1)  sl(2, c)  su(n)  u(1).

(10)

the osp(1/8n) superalgebra has a 5-grading [9, 13, 14], in which the l1 subalgebras, in
the symmetric representation of sl(4n), are completed with the 8n-dimensional fundamental
representation of sp(8n, r), which splits under sl(2, c)  su(n)  u(1) as:

8n  (1/2, 0, n)1/2 + (0, 1/2, n)1/2 + (0, 1/2, n)1/2 + (1/2, 0, n)1/2.

(11)

this splitting corresponds to writing the ads5 spinor qa
the spinor charges (qa

 ), and q a as ( q  a, s a).
 , q  a), together with l1, form the maximal central extension of the

 as (qa

 , sa

super-poincare algebra in d = 4, as found in ref. [7]. the (s a, sa
 ), together with l1, form
an isomorphic algebra, with the substitution p  k and z  zs. the generators in l0
appear in the mixed anti-commutators {q, s}, as it follows from the general structure of the

grading:

as

dim p + = dim c  = 8n 2 + 2n,

dim l0 = 16n 2.

(13)

(15)

note that in the usual conformal extension of the non-centrally extended sp, that we call p0,

lu (2,2/n ) = sp +

(16)

where dim p +

0 = dim c 

0 = 4, dim l0

0 = 15 + n 2.

4 bps states in ads5 and r-symmetry breaking

states that preserve some of the supersymmetries of the d = 4 n-extended super-poincare
algebra sp + can be point-like or extended. these states preserve only subgroups of the r-
symmetry u(n), and their breaking pattern can be analyzed in pure algebraic terms. this
analysis agrees with previous studies of branes in ads5 [11, 15] in all known cases, but also
predicts general patterns of r-symmetry breaking. it should be emphasized that our analysis is
purely in terms of poincare multiplets, and that we do not know whether all breaking patterns

we nd here are eectively realized in the ads/cft correspondence [16, 17, 18, 15].

the identication of brane charges with the central charges of the super-poincare algebra in

eq. (2) is well established in at space. the corresponding identication of brane charges with

4

some bosonic genrators of osp(1/8n) should hold in ads5 [11, 15]. this correspondence was
established explicitly in [11] for a brane charge appearing in the world-volume superalgebra of
a d5-brane in ads5.

let us consider, in particular, the case n = 4, and let us start our analysis with point-like
states (monopoles and dyons). they are associated with a scalar central charge, that we called
z [ab]. it can always be put in the form

z [ab] =   1

2 ! ,

(17)

with  the 2  2 antisymmetric matrix. when 1 = 2 we have a 1/2 bps state, and the
r-symmetry su(4) is broken to usp(4)  o(5). when 1 6= 2 one has 1/4 bps states, and
su(4)  usp(2)  usp(2)  o(3)  o(3).

string bps states are charged under the vector charge z a

along one of the coordinate axis. the only nonzero component of z a
brought to the standard form:

 b. let us consider a string oriented
1 b that can be

 b is, say z a

(18)

by looking at the su(4)  o(6) subgroup left invariant by this matrix one can easily nd all
possible r-symmetry breaking patterns. specically, 1/2 bps states have 1 = 2 = 3; this
means that the r-symmetry is broken to su(2)  su(2)  u(1), or

o(6)  o(4)  o(2).

1/4 bps states have 1 = 2, 3 6= 1. the r-symmetry breaking is in this case

o(6)  su(2)  u(1)2.

when 1 = 2 = 3 the string preserves 3/8 of the original supersymmetries, while

o(6)  su(3)  u(1).

(19)

(20)

(21)

finally, for generic i, one nds a 1/8 bps state preserving only a u(1)3 subgroup of the
r-symmetry.

finally, 2-branes are sources for the antisymmetric-tensor charge z (ab)



, belonging to the

symmetric representation of su(4). by choosing a 2-brane conguration oriented along two
coordinate axis, the only nonzero charge is, say, z (ab)
. it can be brought into the standard

form [19]

z (ab)

12 =

, i  0.

(22)

in this case, 1/2 bps states correspond to all i = , and the r-symmetry breaking pattern is

su(4)  o(4) = o(3)  o(3).

(23)

1/4 bps states arise in two cases. first, when 1 = 2, 3 = 4 6= 1. the residual r-symmetry
is, in this case

su(4)  o(2)  o(2).

(24)

in the second case, 1 = 2, 3 6= 4 and neither 3 nor 4 equal 1. the r-symmetry breaks
as

if 1 = 2 = 3 6= 4, we have 3/8 bps states with r-symmetry

su(4)  o(2).

su(4)  o(3).

(25)

(26)

finally, if all i are dierent, we have 1/8 bps states, which completely break r-symmetry.

the 1/2 bps states on the boundary can be thought of as singletons since they have

multiplicity 2n (n = 4 in our case), if regarded as n-extended 4-d poincare multiplets.

we call s-singleton the usual singleton associated to a massless particle on the boundary,

while we call p-singleton a state associated to a p-brane on the boundary. thus, photons are
s-singletons, monopoles or dyons are 0-singletons etc. bps states propagating in the bulk are
bound states of p-singletons, since they have multiplicity 22n .

to summarize, a p-singleton breaks the original o(6) r-symmetry to o(5  p)  o(p + 1),

while the s-singleton corresponds to p = 1 in this formula.

5 extension to ads7 superalgebras

the analysis performed in the previous two sections can be extended to the ads7 case, based on
the conformal algebra o(8)  o(6, 2). this case is related to the conjectured duality [20, 16]
between m-theory on ads7 and superconformal eld theories in 6-d.

here, maximal or reduced supersymmetry correspond to the osp(8/2n) superalgebras,

with n = 2, 1, respectively.

the contraction of these algebras gives the non-maximally centrally extended supertransla-

tion algebra in d = 7.

6

the maximal central extension of the supertranslation algebra, on the other hand, reads

{qa

 , qb

 } = (c)pab + (c)mab + (c)z o [ab]



+

+(c)z o [ab]

 + cu (ab) + (c)z (ab)
 ,

a, b = 1, .., 4, ,  = 1, .., 8, , .. = 0, .., 6.

(27)

its extension, containing the ads7 isometry algebra o(6, 2), and the r-symmetry algebra
usp(2n), is the superalgebra osp(1/16n), with n = 2, 1 respectively. the o(8) algebra
appears in the decomposition 4

sp(16n, r)  usp(2n)  o(8).

(28)

the osp(1/16n) superalgebra can be written in a manifestly o(6, 2)-invariant form as

follows:

{qa

 , qb

 }+ = (c)+

mab + (c)+
,  = 1, .., 8, .. = 0, .., 7.

z o [ab]

 + (c)+

z + (ab)

 + c +

u (ab),

(29)

and

the subindex + denotes the 8-d chiral projection, and z + (ab)



is self-dual.

this superalgebra reduces to osp(8/2n) by setting to zero the generators z o [ab]



z + (ab)



.

notice that for n = 2, the embedding (28) of o(8) in sp(32, r) is not unique. indeed,it
diers from the embedding obtained by dimensional reduction of osp(1/32), interpreted as
ads11 superalgebra [6]. in this case, the superalgebra reads

{q, q} = (m n c)lm n + (m n p qrsc)t +

m n p qrs,

.. = 1, .., 32, m.. = 0, .., 11,

(30)

where q is a 12-d majorana-weyl spinor and t +
m n p qrs is self-dual. by splitting the index m =
, i ( = 0, .., 7, i = 1, .., 4) it is easy to see that the above superalgebra contains two subalgebras
osp(1/16)l,r, where q splits as 32 = 16l + 16r. the bosonic part of the superalgebra breaks
as

sp(32, r)  so(10, 2)  so(4)  so(6, 2),

(31)

4this embedding is obtained by writing the symplectic metric as 16n = 2n  i8. then, the generators of
sp(16n, r) of factorized form a = a  i8 or a = i2n  b, with a, b 2n  2n and 8  8 matrices, respectively,
form manifestly a subgroup. here in is the n  n identity matrix and n is the canonical n  n symplectic
metric. the symplectic condition on the sp(16n, r) generators is at  = a. the reality condition can be
written in dierent forms. by choosing a = a, the subgroup of factorized matrices is sp(2n, r)  so(8).
by choosing instead a = a, with  = 2n  8, the subgroup is u sp(2n )  o(8) since a obeys the
constraints a = a, 2n at 2n = a, that dene the u sp(2n ) algebra, while b is antisymmetric, bt = b, and
quaternionic, 8b8 = b. the latter constraints dene the generators of o(4, q)  o(8)

7

where so(4) = so(3)l  so(3)r, and so(6, 2) = o(8)l + o(8)r. the 528 generators
of sp(32, r) are in this case arranged as two copies of sp(16, r), and 256 additional gen-
erators, zi, zij (.. = 0, .., 7, i, j = 1, .., 4). these new generators are elements of the
coset sp(32, r)/sp(16, r)l  sp(16, r)r. they are contained in the mixed anticommutators
{16l, 16r}.

the spinor charges decompose as follows as representations of so(6, 2)  so(4):

32 = (8l, 2) + (8r, 2);

(32)

as representations of o(8)l  o(3)l  o(8)r  o(3)r  sp(16, r)l  sp(16, r)r  sp(32, r),
the spinor charges decompose instead as:

32 = (8l, 2l, 1, 1) + (1, 1, 8r, 2r).

(33)

if one drops the above 256 generators one nds two copies of the osp(1/16) superalgebra. by
further truncation one gets osp(8/2)l  osp(8/2)r. therefore, the two embeddings only
coincide when the generators are restricted to a (1, 0) superconformal extension.

the superalgebra in eq. (29), interpreted on ads7, gives a conformal extension of the

maximally centrally extended supertranslation algebra of type (2, 0) and (1, 0), respectively.

for n = 2, this is the osp(1/32, r) algebra given in eqs (27, 29), now written in 6-d

the subindex + is the chiral projector in 6-d and z + (ab)

this boundary algebra can be done using the methods explained in section 4. in particular,
looking at the super-poincare algebra, we nd the following patterns of r-symmetry breaking:
strings are 1/2 bps carrying a nonzero z o [ab] charge. with an appropriate choice of basis it
can be cast in the form

z o [ab] =

this matrix breaks usp(4)  o(5)  usp(2)  usp(2)  o(4).

three-branes carry a nonzero z (ab) charge. it can be reduced to the following form:

z (ab) =   1

2 ! ,

8

(35)

(36)

where  is the 2  2 identity matrix. when 1 = 2, the corresponding state is 1/2 bps, and
the r-symmetry breaks as follows: usp(4)  o(5)  o(3)  o(2). when 1 6= 2, the state is
1/4 bps, and the usp(4) r-symmetry breaks to o(2)  o(2). particles and membranes have

the same r-symmetry breaking pattern as three-branes and strings. these results agree with
the explicit analysis performed in refs. [21, 22]

6 other algebras and uniqueness of the extension

let us conclude with a few additional remarks.

first, let us point out that here is a superalgebra that is intermediate between that in

eqs. (3,4) and that in eqs. (5,6). this is the u(2n, 2n/1) superalgebra.
setting to zero the right-hand side of eq. (4), but keeping all terms in the r.h.s. of eq. (3).

it is obtained by

all these algebras can be written in a manifestly o(4, 2)-invariant notation using the follow-

ing decompostition, where a and s denote symmetrization and antisymmetrization, respectively
(,  = 0, ..5):

[(4, n)  (4, n)]s = [6, (n  n)a] + [10, (n  n)s],

(4, n)  (4, n ) = (1, 1) + (15, 1) + (15, n 2  1) + (1, n 2  1),

{qa, qb} = (c)ma

 + (c)+t + (ab)



,

c.c.

b + ct a

b + (c)t o a

 b.

(37)

here + is the 6-d chiral projection and t + (ab)
is self-dual. the space-time conformal spinors
are identied here with the (4, 4) of su(2, 2). the u(2n, 2n/1) superalgebra is obtained by
setting {qa, qb} = 0, while the u(2, 2/n) superalgebra is obtained by setting {qa, qb} = 0
and t o a



 b = 0.

we must also point out that ads5 algebras with brane charges clearly violate the coleman-
mandula theorem [23]. this should imply that they cannot be realized as symmetries of a local

world-sheet theory. in spite of this, the brane charges studied in ref. [11] are topological charges
appearing in the (local) born-infeld action of the d-brane. the meaning of this result is not

yet clear to us.

let us comment now on the uniqueness of ads5 extensions of the super-poincare algebra
with central charges. for n-extended supersymmetry, osp(1/8n) is the unique extension of
the super-poincare algebra in eq. (2) with the following properties: a) all right-hand sides of
the fermionic anticommutators are nonzero, and form a simple lie algebra; b) it contains the

group o(4, 2)  u(n); c) it has the same number of fermionic charges as the superconformal
algebra u(2, 2/n). this follows from the classication of all superalgebras based on simple

lie algebras given in ref. [24]. likewise, the intermediate algebra u(2n, 2n/1) is the unique

9

superconformal extension of algebra (2) where all chiral poincare anticommutators are set to

zero. for n = 1 one can say more. in that case, indeed, it was shown in ref. [25] that only
two extensions of the super-poincare algebra exist. one, in which all central charges are set to

zero, is the usual u(2, 2/1); the other is, necessarily, osp(1/8). notice that in this case the
intemediate algebra is also u(2, 2, /1). in this case sp + is just the n = 1 supertranslational
algebra considered in [26, 27], while [10]

l0 = r  so(3, 3),

(38)

since sl(4, r)  so(3, 3). the standard lorentz transformations and u(1) r-symmetry cor-
respond to the subgroup so(3, 1)  so(2)  so(3, 3).

conformal extensions exist also in lower dimensions. in ads4, osp(n/4, r) can be enlarged

to osp(1/4n, r). here the embedding of the o(3, 2)  sp(4, r) isometry of ads4 is

sp(4n, r)  o(n)  sp(4, r),

(39)

similarly to the discussion in footnote 4.

the 3-grading structure is

l = sp + + l0 + sc ,
l0 = r  sl(2n, r)  r  sl(2, r)  o(n).

(40)

here sl(2, r)  o(2, 1) is the 3-d lorentz group, and sp + is the maximal central extension
of the 3-d supertranslation algebra in ref. [7].

now, let us discuss 1/2 bps states for n = 8. these bps brane congurations were
discussed in [28]. for this purpose, it is convenient to write the sp + algebra using a triality
change of basis, where q i is a chiral spinor representation of so(8):

{q i, q j} = (c)pij + (c)[abcd]

ij

 [abcd] + c[ab]
z +

ij z[ab],

,  = 1, 2,

i, j = 1, .., 8, a, b = 1, ., 8.

(41)

z +
 [abcd] is o(8) self-dual. for zero-branes, z[ab] can be brought to a normal form by an so(8)
rotation. 1/2 bps states correspond to 3 vanishing eigenvalues of z[ab], that break the o(8)
r-symmetry as

o(8)  o(6)  o(2).

(42)

for strings, the matrix [abcd]
 [abcd] is a singlet
under o(4)  o(4)  o(8). these breaking patterns seem to agree with the explicit analysis of

z +
 [abcd] saturates the 1/2 bps bound when z +

ij

ref. [28].

finally, let us comment about other symplectic extensions. an interesting embedding, cor-
responding to a d5/d3 brane system, is osp(8n, r)  o(4)  usp(2n), where o(4) 
o(2, 1)  o(3). this is an extension of the osp(4/2n) superalgebra, and it was considered in
ref. [11].

the analysis performed in this paper was made without enlarging the fermionic sector of the

superalgebra. if one doubles the spinor charges, instead, other extensions such as osp(2/32, r),
osp(1/32, r)l  osp(1/32, r)r, or osp(1/64, r) are possible. the two latter algebras, have
been proposed recently as minimal superalgebras for describing an ads11 version of m-theory [8,
9], or to unify space-time symmetries in extra dimensions [29].
