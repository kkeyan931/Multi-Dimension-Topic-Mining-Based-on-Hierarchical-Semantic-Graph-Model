perturbative analysis on infrared aspects

of noncommutative qed on r4

theory division, kek, tsukuba, ibaraki 305-0801, japan

m. hayakawa 

december 18, 1999

abstract

here we examine the noncommutative counterpart of qed, which is called as noncom-
mutative qed. the theory is obtained by examining the consistent minimal coupling to
noncommutative u(1) gauge eld. the -product admits the coupling of the matter with
only three varieties of charges, i.e., 0, +1 and 1. ultraviolet divergence can be absorbed
into the rescaling of the elds and the parameters at least at one loop level. to examine
the infrared aspect of the theory the anomalous magnetic dipole moment is calculated. the
dependence on the direction of photon momentum reects the lorentz symmetry violation
of the system. the explicit calculation of the nite part of the photon vacuum polarization
shows the infrared singularity like ln(q  c t c  q) (c  is a noncommutative parameter.)
which also exists in noncommutative yang-mills theory. it is associated with the ultraviolet
behavior of the theory. we also consider the extension to chiral gauge theory in the present
context, but the requirement of anomaly cancellation allows only noncommutative qed.

introduction

noncommutative yang-mills (ncym) theory attracts ones interest after it emerged in the
bps solution of matrix theory [2, 3], and is realized as the eective theory around one of the
perturbative vacua of superstring theory with constant b background [4]. prior to such recent
development noncommutative geometry and the construction of eld theory on it has been de-
veloped [5]. although the noncommutative geometry appearing in the context of perturbative
superstring theory does not seem to have connection with quantum gravity, the general non-
commutative geometry may accommodate the essential ingredients of quantum geometry (which
we do not know at present) by its new machinery. assuming the latter fact we are naturally
inclined to investigate the quantum mechanical aspect of the theory dened on the noncom-
mutative geometry in order to argue whether it really reects the microscopic structure of our
world. but the rst thing to do is to analyze the simplest toy model and know that the theory is
well dened even in the ultraviolet region. it is the most important subject to nd out how the

infrared physics is aected, and whether it provides more desirable foundation for constructing
the concrete model.
ncym theory is widely discussed as it appears in string theory. the realization of such a theory
on the set of the ordinal functions modies the product of two functions in terms of stared
(mentioned hereafter as *-) product. here we consider how the matter eld couples to yang-
mills eld in such a manner that the theory respects this rule of product as well as the gauge
symmetry. the simplest candidate would be a noncommutative counterpart of qed, in which
electron with a denite charge is present. as will be shown in sec. 2 inclusion of matters does
not have so many varieties. in spite of the base manifold considered here being topologically
trivial, charge is limited to three varieties; 0, 1 and 1, the precise meaning of which is dened
in sec. 2. this is stronger requirement than the charge quantization on compact manifold such
as torus. we expect that there would be hilbert space realization for the theory with the elds
of charge  1 on noncommutative geometry and a mapping rule to the function space on the
usual coordinates as was found in ncym theory. thus we call the elds with charge +1 as
electron and the theory including such a object and photon as noncommutative qed (nc-
qed) in this paper. note that the massive scalar elds receive quadratic divergence which leads
us to lose control of ultraviolet (uv) divergence unless supersymmetry forbids its appearance.
contrarily the usual fermion mass receives only logarithmic divergence in four-dimensional qed
or qcd. nonlocal generalization of the interactions is then expected not to drastically modify
the divergent structure as experienced in ncym system, which also needs further clarication.
thus here the system involving fermions with charges 1 is examined primarily.
although ncym system is related to ordinary yang-mills system by rather complex map [6],
there would be nontrivial quantum mechanical dynamics in ncym without maximal supersym-
metry. one aspect of ncym theory has been argued to describe the large n ordinary yang-mills
theory with a xed thooft coupling constant in the high momentum region [7, 8]. it relies on
analysis of diagrams and the pattern of momentum-dependent phase factors appearing in it.
more direct connection through the correlators of the gauge invariant operators is welcome in
spite of curious nature of general wilson loop operators in noncommutative yang-mills theory
[8, 9, 10]. but it is beyond our present scope.
in order to access to the infrared side, the rst thing we can do is to investigate the perturbative
aspects. the perturbative analysis on uv structure of ncym theory has been done in ref.
[11, 12]. the infrared side on ncym as well as nc-qed is our primary concern. naive con-
tinuation of asymptotically free nature [11] indicates the existence of such a dynamical scale as
qcd at which the coupling constant diverges while naive commutative limit reduces to abelian
gauge theory. the renormalization refers to the structures much higher than noncommutative
energy scale. thus the commutative limit of the renormalized quantum theory do not reduce it
to its commutative counterpart even in the low momentum region. we would like to begin in
this paper with seeking the dynamics which could not be reached in local eld theory, by rst
examining a simple model, nc-qed.
the paper is organized as follows: sec. 2 is concerned with construction of classical action
involving the matter elds and showing that the allowed choice is quite limited.
in sec. 3
noncommutative qed theory is quantized and the anomalous magnetic dipole moment is cal-
culated to see whether the radiative eect from noncommutative extension appears in the nite
quantities. there the infrared behavior is further investigated by observing the nite part of the
vacuum polarization of photon. the potentially appearing 1/q2-singularity cancels among the
diagrams, but the logarithmic infrared singularity is found, which also exists in ncym theory.

2

such a structure in the infrared side is connected to the uv side. the extension to the chiral
gauge theory is also examined in sec.4, but it is found that there is no chiral gauge theory. sec.
5 is devoted to the discussion and conclusion of the present paper.

2 noncommutative qed

pure noncommutative u(1) yang-mills action

sy m = z ddx (cid:18)

4g2(cid:19) f  f  ,

(1)

(space-time dimension d is set equal to four in nal.) is nothing but the one obtained from the
ordinary su(n) yang-mills action by replacing the matrix multiplication to the star (hereafter
referred as -)product

a  b(x)  e

1

,

(2)

2i c  ()

 ()

 a(x + ) b(x + )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12),0

with an antisymmetric matrix c  which characterizes noncommutativity of space-time by mod-
ifying the algebra of functions. even in u(1) case a couples to itself since the eld strength
f of a has the nonlinear term

f = a   a  i[a, a ]m ,

where [a, b]m denotes moyal bracket:

[a, b]m = a  b  b  a .

(3)

(4)

the -product obeys the associative law which is also satised by the matrix algebra so that
the manipulation in this case resembles the one experienced in the calculus of matrix. thus it
is quite simple to see the action (1) is invariant under

a(x)  a(x) = u (x)  a(x)  u 1(x) + iu (x)  u 1(x) ,

(5)

where u (x) = (ei(x)) is dened by an innite series expansion of multiple -product of scalar
function (x). u 1(x) = (ei(x)) is similarly dened and plays the role of the inverse of u (x).
here and hereafter we assume that the elds decrease so promptly at innity that the space-time
integral of a moyal bracket (which corresponds to the trace of the commutator in the matrix
language) vanishes.
the coupling of electron to gauge eld in noncommutative u(1) yang-mills theory receives
a severe restriction. the gauge transformation (5) for the gauge eld shows that the simple
candidate of the interaction (x)  a(x) or a(x)   implies that  and  must transform as

(x)  (x) = u (x)  (x) ,

(x)  (x) = (x)  u (x)1 ,

(6)

respectively in order for each product with gauge eld to transform in the same way as the
original eld. the covariant derivative

d =   ia  , d  =   + i   a ,

(7)

3

also transforms covariantly in the same way as the original objects. since the commutative limit
leads to the elds with +1 charge and 1 charge respectively in ordinary qed, so we call the
eld  in the above a eld with +1 charge and referred hereafter as electron (opposite to the
usual convention). then the action

smatter = z ddx(cid:0)   id  m   (cid:1) ,

(8)

is invariant under local u(1) symmetry since  1 behaves in the same manner as . the eld with
charge +1(1) in noncommutative case would correspond to (anti-)fundamental representation
in ordinary nonabelian gauge theory. it is also reminiscent of such features that noncommuta-
tive gauge theory carries the internal degrees of freedom by imbedding them into the space-time
geometry itself. this is the reverse process of the reduction of the space-time degrees of freedom
into the internal ones in the large n gauge theory [13]. when we pursue this correspondence
further, we are inclined to guess that the higher-rank representation of su(n) gauge theory may
convert into some matter elds in noncommutative gauge theory. it would be the counterpart
of the elds of integral multiple of unit charge from the view point of noncommutative gener-
alization of u(1) gauge theory. actually the adjoint representation corresponds to a eld (x)
with zero charge in total but transforming in the by-product form

(x)  (x) = u (x)  (x)  u 1(x) .

(9)

its covariant derivative is given by moyal bracket. however we cannot nd the counterpart
of the second-rank antisymmetric representation, etc, of su(n) gauge theory. the -product
admits only the elds with charge 0, +1 or 1. as a by-product the vacuum expectation value
of wilson loop operator for a rectangular loop becomes associated with the ground state energy
acting between two sources of charges, +1 and 1, as usual.

3 perturbative aspects in infrared side

we are interested in the quantum mechanical aspect of the theory dened by the sum of (1)

and (8)

sncqed = z ddx (cid:18)

4g2 f  f  +   id  m   (cid:19) .

(10)

here we consider the theory on minkowski space with nonzero c 23 but vanishing c 01 in the
canonical basis of antisymmetric matrix c  for the later purpose of calculating the anomalous
magnetic dipole moment.
perturbation theory begins with rescaling a  ga and gauge xing. brst quantization as
in ordinary qcd theory leads the gauge xing and faddeev-popov (fp) terms

sgf = z ddx(cid:18)

quantization is dened by perturbative expansion due to feynman rule as was done for ncym
theory in ref. [11], but now derive from the actions (10) and (11)

1 to compute the form factor of the on-shell electron coupling to photon we consider a theory in minkowski

space. thus  = 0.

the extra ultraviolet divergent contributions arise in addition to those already appearing in
ncym theory. as we concentrate on reporting on the infrared phenomena in this short article,
we postpone to describe the detail about ultraviolet divergence at one-loop level in the future
extended volume [14], and state the results only in brief: all the one loop ultraviolet divergence
can be subtracted by the local counterterms with maintaining the equalities among various z
factors (wave function renormalization constant, etc.) required from gauge invariance. the 
function becomes for nf number of copies of electron elds

a contribution 22
3 is due to the structure similar to nonabelian dynamics, su(2) yang-mills
theory [11]. however the matter contribution is that found in ordinary qed theory with unit
charge, not that of the quarks belonging to the fundamental representation of su(2) gauge the-
ory (in which 2
in this analysis there is an important feature that should be kept in mind for the analysis of
infrared aspect of the theory. only planar diagrams can have overall divergence. noncommu-
tativity of the theory manifests itself in the form of a momentum-dependent phase associated
with the vertex in feynman rule. planar diagram is a portion of the contributions which has
a denite phase factor, but it only depends on the external momenta, not on any loop momenta.
once loop momentum enters in the phase factor, the suppression factor which depend on the
external momentum through c  is always induced. this is the same feature already shared by
ncym theory [15, 7, 8]. the explicit two-loop computation similar to ref. [16] in 4 theory is
welcome to reveal further detail structure of the present theory.
to observe an infrared aspects of the theory, the leading correction to magnetic dipole coupling
is estimated. the extraction of dipole coupling in the  a vertex function yields

where x = (q2)(cid:8)(+ + )2m2 + +(q2)(cid:9). since k1(x)  1

x for x  0 we can take q2 and
q2 2 to zero without confronting with any singularities. thus, for q2 = 0 and q2 = 0, h(1, p, q) is
equal to h(0, p, q). therefore the leading correction to the magnetic dipole moment is the same
for ordinary qed and nc-qed. but the non-zero photon momentum in the direction transverse
to (2, 3) plane is allowed. eq. (13) shows that the strength of magnetic dipole coupling is aected
for such a photon in general.
we examine the infrared behavior of the renormalized vertex functions, especially the vacuum
polarization for photon. as the analysis is lacking even for ncym theory 3, the common
contributions, the fp-ghost loop, gauge boson loop are examined here. taking feynman gauge
for simplicity, they can be written in terms of schwinger parameterization [19]

if the integral in eq. (17) were evaluated with q2 set equal to zero. the logarithmic infrared

4 chiral gauge theory

until now all the fermions are assumed to be dirac fermions.

it is naturally tempted to
pursue the extension to chiral gauge theory. the classical analysis given in sec. 2 is irrelevant
to the chiral property of fermion. thus weyl fermions can have the charge +1 or 1. the
right-handed fermion with +1 charge is easily seen to be replaced by its cp conjugate (the left-
handed) fermion also in the present context. the chiral gauge theory simply implies that the
number of the left-handed fermions with +1 charge is not equal to one with 1. the question is
whether such a theory can circumvents a triangle loop anomaly to dene a consistent quantum

4 d. bigatti and l. susskind has argued this structure of singularities [7].

theory or not.
it is easy to see the triangle loop diagram is planar. once we remind the correspondence between
the current theory to ordinary nonabelian gauge system in which the external momentum plays
the role of color in yang-mills theory, the remained integral is evaluated completely in the same
manner as encountered in ordinary nonabelian gauge theory involving the fundamental and/or
anti-fundamental weyl fermions. from this observation, the number of the left-handed fermions
with 1 charge has to match with the number of fermions with +1 in the system 5. such a
theory is vector-like, i.e., noncommutative qed considered until the previous sections.

5 conclusion

in this paper we attempt to nd the noncommutative analogue of qed and argue the per-
turbative aspects of its infrared dynamics. the anomalous magnetic dipole moment does not
change at leading order for the photon moving in the direction along which noncommutativity is
irrelevant. however the form factor seems to indicate the possible observation of lorentz invari-
ance so(1,3) by controlling the direction of photon although the conventional environment of
measurement averages over the direction of photon. in order to discuss quantum aspects of the
theory, it would be the best to calculate and investigate the radiatively corrected cross sections
for the electron-positron annihilation, mller scattering, compton, or photon-photon scattering
processes with explicitly specied helicities of the external states.
for the preparation of this analysis, the nite part of vacuum polarization of the photon is
calculated to study more about the low momentum behavior. the absence of 1/q2 is connected
with the absence of quadratic uv divergence.
in more detail the magnitude of the infrared
singularity is the same as that of logarithmic uv divergence.
the requirement of anomalous diagrams being cancelled in total is too strong for chiral gauge
theory to exist in the present context. it is an interesting and important subject to pursue the
possibility to relax this requirement.

note added

during preparation of the paper, we nd a preprint [18] reported a few days ago, which dis-
cussed the subject partly overlapping with the present paper. the result here coincides with
that obtained there.

5 we require that the triangular loop contribution cancels with each other for all momentum conguration.
but it might be too strong requirement for noncommutative su(n) gauge theory due to non-factorizability of
color and phase factors, as suggested by y. kitazawa.
