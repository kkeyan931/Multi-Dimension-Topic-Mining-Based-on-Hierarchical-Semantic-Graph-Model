dierent models of eld theories in two dimensions can be described by the action t rr f .

in the presence of a curved background, we construct a local supersymmetrylike transformations

under which the action is invariant. furthermore, by analysing the cohomology of the theory

we show the absence of anomalies. also the ultraviolet as well as the infrared niteness of the

1 introduction

two dimensional elds models [1] play an important role in physics as well as in mathe-

matics. for instance, conformal eld theories and sigma models lead to the development

of string theory. on the other hand, by studying low dimensional theories one can gain

experience which could help to tackle more complicated problems already present in the

4dimensional world.

2d physics has some interesting features, like for instance the action describing the yang

mills model with vanishing coupling constant and the action of the jackiwteitelboim

model for 2d gravity have the same form, namely t rr f . the same action is obtained

by compactifying the chernsimons model [2] on a circle. this was studied by many

authors [3], [4] and [5]. in this work we will generalize the analysis of [5] to be valid in a

curved spacetime. the main ingredient of our analysis is the use of the landau gauge

where local supersymmetrylike transformations are manifest [6], [7]. another interesting

property of the landau gauge is the existence of the ghost equation [9] which is very

helpful for the analysis. our strategy is to follow an algebraic way [8] and show the sta-

bility of the theory. furthermore, the calculation of possible counterterms is carried out

essentially by using cohomology techniques [10], [11], [12]. the advantage in using the

framework of algebraic renormalization is that one does not need to specify a subtrac-

tion scheme like for instance the bphz or the dimensional regularization schemes. on

the other hand, such a scheme should exist, a fact which will allow us to use the above

mentioned algebraic renormalization. this fact limited our quantum analysis to be valid

only in curved, topologically trivial, and asymptotically at manifolds.

this work is organized as follows: in section 2 we present the classical analysis of the two

dimensional model considered in a curved spacetime. we begin by describing the classi-

cal theory, and we show that local susylike transformations do exist. this section is also

devoted to the discussion of the infrared regularization of the ghostantighost propagator

and its implications. then, we generalize the local susylike transformations of the model

and we show that the corresponding ward identity is linearly broken.

next, in section 3, we construct the most general counterterm which is, in turn, forbidden

by the ghost equation. therefore no deformations are allowed and the theory is nite.

in section 4, the 2d theory is proved to be anomaly free. this last result allows us to

extend the classical analysis to all orders of perturbation theory. hence the niteness

of the two dimensional model, dened on a curved manifold, is proven at all orders of

perturbation theory.

2

2 the model and its infrared regularization

we devote this section to the classical analysis and the infrared regularization of the 2d
theory, considered on a two dimensional curved manifold m, in the landau gauge.
the most important feature of such a eld model is that it is topological [17] and possesses
the following invariant action, which is metric2 independent:

inv =

1

2 zm

d2xf a

 a,

(1)

where  is a second rank antisymmetric tensor3 density of weight 1, and the eld strength
f a

 is given by:

f a
 = aa

   aa

 + f abcab

ac
.

(2)

here f abc denotes the structure constants of the gauge group, which is supposed to be a
compact lie group and all the elds belong to its adjoint representation. aa
 is the gauge

eld.

now, we briey review some connections of the action (1) with dierent two dimensional

theories.

(i) first, following [4], we consider the action

s = zm

d2x(cid:16) 

2

aa  i

 af a

(cid:17),

(3)

where  plays the role of the coupling constant. after integrating over the eld a in the

partition function

and using the gaussian integral identity

z = z dadaa

es,

z +



dx

exp(

2

x2  ixy) = exp(

y2
22 ),

(4)

(5)

one can easily see that the action (3) gives rise to the same partition function as the
2d yangmills action. moreover, for vanishing coupling constant   0 the action (3)
reduces to

2here are our conventions: we denote the spacetime metric by g , its inverse by g and its deter-
minant by g. the scalar density g has weight +1, whereas the volume element density d2x has weight
-1, which means that the invariant volume element dv = gd2x has vanishing weight, then transforms
as a scalar under dieomorphisms.

3for the levicivita density  we choose 12 = 1. furthermore, we have  = g1gg,

where  has weight +1 and  has weight -1.

(6)

hence, in the limit where (  0) the 2d yangmills action and (6) lead to the same
partition function z.
(ii) second we consider the 3d topological chernsimons theory

c.s = 

1

2 z d3x(aa

aa

 +

3

f abcaa

ab

ac

),

(7)

where the indices ,  and  are the 3d spacetime indices. now if we compactify the

chern simons model (7) on a circle, we get a two dimensional theory described exactly
by an action of the same form as (1) where the eld a is nothing but the third component
of the 3d gauge eld aa

 in the compactied direction.

(iii) the third possibility we mention is the relation of (1) to 2d gravity. here we follow

chamseddine and wyler [3] where the following action was proposed as a model for 2d

gravity

in this case

g =

(9)

a, b and c take the values (0, 1, 2) and the generators  a of the group so(1, 2) give

rise to the following algebra

[ a,  b] = abc  c.

(10)

to explicitly see the connection between a 2d gravity model and the action (8) one let
the gauge eld ea
 = .

 decompose in the zweibein eld ea

 and the spin connection e2

after some computations (for details, see [3]) one gets from (8) the action

 stands for the cosmological constant. at this level one recognizes that beginning with

eb

(8) one could derive the jackiwteitelboim model for 2d gravity, given by (11).

above, we have seen some connections between dierent eld models and their relation to

the action (1), which seems to be the meeting point of dierent 2d theories. motivated

by these facts, from now on, we will concentrate on the analysis of the action (1), which

is invariant under the gauge symmetry

 = (a + f abcab

gaa
ga = f abcbc,

c)  (d)a,

(12)

where a is the gauge parameter. to x this gauge freedom we choose a landautype

gauge such that the gauge xing part of the action, in which the metric describing the

4

manifold appears explicitly, writes down as

gf = szm

d2x(cid:16)gg caaa
(cid:17) .

the gauge xed action (inv + gf ) is invariant under the brs [15] symmetry:

saa
 = (dc)a,
sa = f abccbc,
sca = 1
2 f abccbcc,
sca = ba,
s2 = 0.

sba = 0,

(13)

(14)

ca denotes the faddeev-popov ghost eld of ghost number +1, ca is the antighost eld
of ghost number -1 and ba is the lagrange multiplier of ghost number 0 enforcing the

landau gauge condition.

as for the other topological gauge eld models [13],[24], [7], [26], the metric g is only

present in the gauge xing part of the action which is nothing else but an exact brs

variation. this fact implies that, here, one can also extend the brs symmetry [19] by

letting the operator s acting on the background metric as:

sg = g

sg = 0.

(15)

thus the metric is just a gauge parameter, of which the physical observables are indepen-

dent. clearly, g is a symmetric tensor of ghost number one.
in addition to the brs symmetry, the gauge xed action (inv + gf ) is also invariant

under a local supersymmetrylike transformations (called superdieomorphisms in [13],
[24], [7]) and whose parameter we denote by , which has ghost number +2.

()a =  ggca,
()ca = aa
,
()ca = 0,
()ba = lca,
()g = lg,
()g = 0,

(16)

where l denotes the lie derivative. when we anticommute the brs operator s with ()
we get the onshell algebra

ns, ()o = l + equations of motion.

5

(17)

on the other hand, in the context of perturbation theory, the model has an infrared
problem. indeed, in the at spacetime limit the propagator hcacai is logarithmic divergent
in the infrared limit. to regularize hcacai one has to introduce a mass m [5] such that

hcacai =

1

k2 + m2

.

(18)

as remarked by the authors of [5], the physical observables are dened in the limit of

vanishing mass. however, as long as m is not zero, the physical quantities may depend on

it. a similar situation was already analyzed in the literature, where it was conjectured [21]

and then shown [20] that (in the context of a 2d nonlinear sigma model) local observables

are well dened in the vanishing mass limit. for topological eld theories, however, we

have nonlocal observables.

in the spirit of [21], the authors of [5] have extended the

conjecture of elitzur [21] to include nonlocal observables, too.

in this paper we will not worry about such questions but concentrate our eort in proving

the perturbative niteness of the model. thus, in our case (in the curved spacetime)
we also introduce a mass term m2 which would regularize the propagator hcacai. then of
course the action gets modied4 by adding the integrated local polynomial m

(19)

(20)

the external sources 1 and 2 are scalars and  
4 are contravariant vector densities
of weight one. by just looking at the transformations (20) we observe that the brs
operator s is still nilpotent s2 = 0 and then m is by construction brs invariant.
another important remark is that the metric g does still appear in the action only
through the brs exact term (gf + m). thus the physical observables still do not

3 and  

depend on g, in turn this fact enables us to maintain the brs transformation of the

in order to write down the slavnov identity we couple the nonlinear brs transforma-

hence, the total action takes the form:

where,

(26)

(27)

at this level we see that the ward identity of the local susylike symmetry is linearly bro-

ken. this is not the case for the topological yang-mills model [24], the three dimensional

bf model [7], and the chern-simons model [13] considered in a curved manifold, where

one had to do with a hard breaking.

(28)

the letter f stands for all the elds describing the model under investigation, whereas

lie derivative. furthermore, the action  obeys three constraints:

(i) the gauge condition

(31)

(

to obtain the ghost equation, one has simply to integrate over the spacetime the quantity

ca ) and then use the gauge condition (29).
we end this section by displaying the algebraic structure of the model. first, consider an
arbitrary local functional  depending on the elds (aa
, a, ca, ca, ba, a, la, a, g,
g, 1, 2,  

4 ), one can derive the following nonlinear algebra

3 ,  

s(w d

()) + w d
nw d
(),w d
()  ()) + w s
nw d
(),w s
nw s
(),w s

ss() = 0,
()s() = 0,
()o  = w d
()s() = w d
()o  = w s
( )o  = 0.

s(w s

([,]),

(),
([,]),

(32)

second, if the functional  obeys the slavnov identity as well as the two ward identities

for dieomorphisms and local susylike symmetry, then we get the linear oshell algebra

{ss,s} = 0,
()o = 0,
nss,w d
()o = w d
nw d
(),w d
()o = w d
ns,w s
()o = w s
nw s
(),w d
( )o = 0.
nw s
(),w s
here, we have used the following notation

(),
([,]),

([,]),

[, ] =  + ,
[, ] =   .

(33)

(34)

where [ , ] stands for the graded lie bracket. furthermore, for reasons which will be clear
in the next section, we have attributed ghost number one to , the vector parameter of

the dieomorphism transformations.

9

we conclude this section by remarking that the mass m, used to regularize the infrared

divergent propagator, as in (18) could destroy the algebraic structure (17) of the model at

the o-shell level (33). to maintain this structure, in the presence of a curved background,
the price to pay was the introduction of four new external sources [5] 1, 2,  
3 and  
4 ,
which appear in the action through the metric dependent and brsexact expression m.

3 cohomology analysis

in this section we will look for all possible quantum corrections for the model. indeed,

the construction of the most general counterterm can be done as follows, rst we add a
perturbation  to the total action  such that the perturbed action  =  +  fullls

the slavnov identity (23), and the two ward identities (26), (28) as well as the identities

(29), (30) and (31). therefore  must obey the constraints:

(39)

(40)

 is an integrated local polynomial of dimension, weight and ghost number zero. from

equation (35) we immediately see that  does not depend on the lagrange multiplier
eld ba. on the other hand, from (36) we deduce that the integrated polynomial  can
depend on the elds a, ca and la only through the combinations

a = a + gg ca   
4 ca,
la = la  g2ca.

concerning the three equations (38)  (40), we put them in a single equation

such that the operator  is of the form

 = 0

 = s + w d

() + w s

() +zm

(41)

(42)

.

(43)

an easy check is to show its nilpotency,

2 = 0,

(44)

so that (42) is a cohomology problem possessing two possible solutions.
indeed, (42)
possesses solutions of the form  =  . these are called trivial solutions because the
nilpotency of  immediately implies that any expression of the form   is automatically
a solution of (42). in what follows we will call cohomology of  the space of all solutions

of (42) modulo trivial solutions.

the rst step in solving the cohomology problem (42) is to introduce a ltering operator
n and assigne to each eld (including  and ) homogeneity degree 1.

+zm
the operator n induces a decomposition of 

n = zm

as well as a decomposition of 

 = 0 + 1 + ... + n ,

n,

 = xn0

(45)

(46)

(47)

where the index n refers to the corresponding homogeneity degree. the operator 0 in
(46) has the property that it does not increase the homogeneity degree when it acts on a

eld polynomial. on the other hand, due to the nilpotency of  we also have

and more generally

2
0 = {0, 1} = 0,

k

xi=0

iki = 0;

k  n.

an obvious identity which follows from (46) and  = 0 reads as

0 = 0,

(48)

(49)

(50)

due to the nilpotency of 0 (48), the above equation (50) denes a new cohomology prob-
lem. an interesting result is the following theorem6

6 an immediate corollary of the theorem is as follows: if the cohomology of 0 is empty (trivial), then

that of  is also empty.

11

theorem:

the cohomology of the operator  is isomorphic to a subspace of the cohomology of the

operator 0.
more concretely, for the 2d model under investigation, we have

2  adxdx ,

(51)

(52)

and d is the exterior derivative d = dx.
one can easily see from (51) that the following couples of elds (g, g), (1, 2), ( 
3 ,  
4 )
and (,) appear in 0doublets, and then are not present in the cohomology [11].
now, let us solve 0 = 0. the local integrated polynomial  can be written as

where p

q is a polynomial of ghost number p and form degree q. by letting the operator

(53)

0 acting on (53) and taking into account (50) we get, after using stocks theorem

2 + d1

1 = 0

(54)

now, by applying once again 0 on equation (54) and using the algebraic poincare lemma7
[11] and the facts that 2

0 = 0 and {0, d} = 0 we get the descent equations

00
01

2 + d1
1 + d2
02

1 = 0,
0 = 0,
0 = 0.

it is clear that the solution8 of the last equation in (55) is

(56)

0 =

7roughly speaking, the algebraic poincare lemma states that, in the space of forms depending on

the elds and their derivatives, the cohomology of the exterior derivative d is trivial. for the exact

formulation and proof of the lemma see [11].

8where  = at a and c = cat a. t r is the trace dened by t r(t at b) = ab and t a are the generators

of the gauge group.

12

where n,m are constant coecients. the condition that the solution of (42) must be

invariant under the whole operator  implies that n,m = 0 unless m = 0. in this case we
dene n,0  n. in turn, 2

0 takes the form

2

0 =

(57)

for n = 0, of course, one has 2

(1, ..., 4) and (1,n, ..., 6,n) are constant coecients and the functions fi with (1  i  5)
are given by



fi() =

i,nt rn.

(60)

on the other hand, the trivial counterterm (59) would depend on the transformation
parameters  and  which are present in  (43). the requirement that (59) must be

independent of this two transformation parameters reduces the trivial counterterm to the

13

simpler form

d2x (aa + laca  aaa
),

(61)

  = sz m
 s ,

with  a constant. so, the possible deformation of the total action (21) is of the general

form

 = c + s .

(62)

in constructing the counterterm (62) we took into account all the constraints (35)(40)

except the ghost equation (37). in fact, the expression (62) violates (37) unless all the

constant coecients appearing in (62) vanish. therefore the action (21) admits no defor-

mations and all the quantities present at the classical level remain the same and receive no

corrections. furthermore, if the constraints hold at the quantum level and the symmetries

are not broken, then the complete absence of deformations would imply the absence of

quantum corrections. in this case the theory is said to be nite.

4 anomaly analysis

the last point to be discussed is the possibility of extending the above analysis to all

orders of perturbation theory. this fact is only allowed when anomalies are absent .

the three conditions (35), (36) and (37) can be proven to be renormalizable at all orders

of perturbation theory by using the arguments of [8] and [9]. concerning the slavnov

identity and the two ward identities for dieomorphisms and local susylike symmetry, if

there is an anomaly, then for the generating functional of vertex functions  =  + o(h)

we must have

due to the nilpotency of  we get a new cohomology problem

 = a.

a = 0,

where a is an integrated local polynomial of form degree 2 and ghost number 1.

now, using the same strategy as explained in the previous section, we get the following

set of descent equations

01
02

2 + d2
1 + d3
03

1 = 0,
0 = 0,
0 = 0.

the last equation in (66) is solved by

3

0 =







xn=0

xm=0

xr=0

n,m,rt r(ncmcrc).

(67)

this will yield an expression of a which is not invariant under the whole operator , i .e.
a 6= 0 unless n,m,r = 0 for all nonvanishing values of n, m, and r. this particularly
means that we are left with the single term 3

0 = f abccacbcc, which leads to

1
2 = f abc(acbcc + aaabcc).

(68)

a quick verication shows that 1

2 is invariant under the whole operator . hence, the

possible anomaly candidate solving (64) takes the form

a = zm

f abc(acbcc + aaabcc),

(69)

where  stands for a constant coecient. but this anomaly candidate violates the ghost

equation (37), a fact which imposes the restriction  = 0. the nal result is as follows:

the brs symmetry, the dieomorphisms and the local susylike symmetry are anomaly

free, then valid at the quantum level. therefore, the 2d model is anomaly free and

ultraviolet as well as infrared nite at all orders of perturbation theory. however, as

already mentioned in the introduction, our proof of the niteness is only valid in the case

of a topologically trivial and asymptotically at manifolds.
