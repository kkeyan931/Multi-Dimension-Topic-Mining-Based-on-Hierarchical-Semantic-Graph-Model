done section 10. also shown individual classifying algebra automorphism type g depends automorphism g, specic orbifold subalgebra a, i.e. group g containing g. afterwards, section 11, turn detailed study dependence classify- ing algebra chosen torus partition function, leads concept t-duality boundary conditions. first show dierence automorphism char- acterizing torus partition function automorphism type boundary condition observable, discuss aspects t-duality among (families of) boundary conditions xed choice torus partition function. emphasize t-duality boundary con- ditions one-to-one map, general. section 12 establish action orbifold group g space boundary conditions, implies certain homogeneity among boundary conditions xed g-orbit . finally introduce section 13 concept universal classifying algebra, governs conformally invariant boundary conditions time, discuss possibility obtain algebra suitable projective limit. sections 14 15 turn attention specic class boundary conditions refer involutary, namely orbifold group z2. rst address general features then, section 15, analyze several classes examples particular interest. afterwards, section 16 provide several classes examples complicated orbifold groups, instance untwisted stabilizer subgroups occur proper subgroups full stabilizers. finally, pertinent formulae  needed sequel collected appendix a. 7 action orbifold group a-modules elements g orbifold group g automorphisms chiral algebra a. sequel deal various subgroups g properties. rst observe every automorphism g implemented physical a-modules h maps (7.1) : h hg , g () g obey g-twisted intertwining property g = g(y ) g , (7.2) 3 maps g dened property scalar multiple. (for concrete realization maps wzw theories, see {$9905038$}.) general, implementation () g maps given space h a-module hg, thereby organizing primary elds a-theory orbits, much like simple current group g = g organizes  a-primaries orbits. every a-primary associate stabilizer := {g g| g = } , (7.3) subgroup g whose elements constitute endomorphisms h h. stabilizers a-primaries g-orbit identical (in general case non-abelian g, conjugate subgroups); vacuum maximal stabilizer, = g. also, a-modules g-orbit isomorphic a-modules. endomorphisms g g provide us action h is, general, projective, hence determines two- cocycle e or, precisely (in agreement fact maps g dened normalization), cohomology class e. denote u subgroup corresponds regular elements associated twisted group algebra ces, i.e. u := {g | e(g, g) =e(g, g) g s} . (7.4) scalar factors denition implementers g chosen way maps g g u provide us honest representation u h. follows a-modules h decomposed h = mju vj h,j , (7.5) spaces vj projective s-modules spaces h,j a-modules. make mild technical assumption modules vj h,j irreducible; holds true known examples, rigorously proven vacuum  well  a-modules, including twisted sectors. case vacuum, multiplicities appear decomposition; thus action g genuine u = = g. since construction g leaves subalgebra xed, maps g ordinary intertwiners a; hence decomposition (7.5) act solely degeneracy space vj. moreover, general properties twisted group algebras (compare appendix b ), spaces vj dimensionp|s|/|u|, basis twisted group algebra ces chosen way every g u implemented diagonal matrix acting vj. result (7.5) compared similar decomposition (3.9) arises simple current point view, i.e. h h = mjg/s v hj . (7.6) spaces v projective s-modules, corresponding cocycle f s, spaces hj a-modules; assumption, latter modules irreducible (this assumption indeed satised cases know of). simple current theory  shows 4 decomposition (7.6) isomorphic a-modules appear precisely consequence xed point resolution; therefore multiplicity hj decomposition given |u|. hand, seen above, elements orbifold group g stabilizer relate isomorphic a-modules. thus identify groups u g/s. make manifest, dualize exact sequence 0 u g complete exact sequence 0 g = g u 0 . (7.7) conversely, decomposition a-module h appear |u| many irreducible a- modules. simple current language, number irreducibles length orbit, hence dualize 0 u g complete 0 g = g u 0 . (7.8) consequence, cardinalities respective subgroups g g related |s| |u| = |g| = |g| = |s| |u| , (7.9) hence particular dimensions degeneracy spaces decompositions (7.5) (7.6) coincide: (dimv )2 = |s| /|u| = |s| /|u| = (dim vj)2 . abbreviate dimensions := dimv = dim vj . (7.10) (7.11) also manifest relationship groups g/u. first realize implementation g whole g-orbit provides us two-cocycle g values u(1) whose restriction coincides e; denote cocycle symbol e. given cocycle, commutator cocycle e, dened e(g, g) := e(g, g)/e(g, g) (7.12) g, g g, constitutes  bi-homomorphism g g alternating sense e(g, g) = e(g, g). let us characterize every js element hj g property (7.13) e(hj, g) = j(g) g g ; group element hj exists because, owing exactness sequence (7.8), every js j(g) = 1 g u, (7.13) characterizes hj uniquely element u. furthermore, consequence character property e rst argument, g g, tells us hjhj = hjj modulo u. follows mapping e(hjj, g) = e(hjhj, g) j hj u 5 (7.14) (7.15) constitutes isomorphism g/u. worth noting isomorphism logically independent isomorphism g/s u exists according sequence (7.8). result obvious dual analogue. work recall appendix  commutator cocycle f f, dened f(j, l) =f(j, l)/f(l, j) j, ls, possesses natural extension. f alternating bi-homomorphism s, extension bi-homomorphism g s; imposing alternating property extended bi-homomorphism g g, still denoted f. character property f second argument, associate every g element kg k() g stipulating g f(kg, l) = g(l) lg , (7.16) determines kg uniquely elements u. character property f rst argument implies (7.17) f(kgg, l) = f(kgkg, l) , kgkg = kgg modulo u. thus map g kg u (7.18) g/u isomorphism. later reference also mention another isomorphism similar (7.18). namely, consider character g rather character g g. requirement (7.19) f( kg, l) = g(l) ls determines kg uniquely modulo u, g kg u (7.20) isomorphism elements identity u (and hence regarded restrictions elements s) s/u. furthermore, combining prescriptions learn restrictions relevant bi-homomorphisms stabilizer groups closely related. indeed, denoting g restriction given element g s, g, g kg, kg s. e(g, g) = kg(g) = g( kg) = f( kg, kg) (7.21) 8 automorphism types demonstrated  reection coecients r (,); , i.e. operator product coecients expansion (5.4)a bulk eld approaching boundary, equal one- dimensional irreducible representations r classifying algebra c( a), evaluated basis element (,) c( a). thus given (see formula (5.48)) r (,); = r( (,)) = s(,),/ , . (8.1) 6 moreover, follows sum rule (5.22)a fact c( a) semisimple, reection coecients even provide inequivalent irreducible c( a)-representations. isomorphism classes irreducible c( a)-representations one-to-one correspondence conformally invariant boundary conditions preserve orbifold subalgebra = ag chiral algebra a. section discuss implications basic result. let us associate boundary condition  collection monodromy charges qj(), jg, . monodromy charges depend choice represen- tative g-orbit , via prescription g(j) := exp(2iqj()) (8.2) jg, furnish character (8.3) simple current group. (this g-character confused , character subgroup u g.) group g = (g) naturally identied orbifold group, g g, hence quantity g regarded element g. proceed, observe simple current symmetry g g established formula (5.16), sj(,), = g(j) s(,), r( j(,)) = sj(,), , = g(j) s(,), , = g(j) r( (,)) (8.4) (8.5) every simple current jg. reection coecients constitute main ingredient relation boundary blocks b(,) (dened formula (4.23)a) boundary states b. using notation introduced (8.2), precise relationship, established formula (6.4), reads b = 1 ms g r (,); h  b(,) . (8.6) thus observation (8.5) tells us boundary blocks b(,) primary elds a- theory lie one g-orbit contribute boundary states b xed relative phase, determined element g orbifold group. put dierently, presence boundary condition  reection bulk eld boundary twisted action group element g g. observation suggests that, terminology , orbifold group element g provides us automorphism type 2 boundary condition . establish indeed case, insert expression (8.1) reection coecients explicit 2 corresponding term  gluing automorphism. information contained boundary condition goes beyond automorphism type referred chan--paton type . thinking analogy general analysis modular invariant partition functions torus, may seem suggestive take fusion rule automorphism g starting point description automorphism 7 values one-point correlators boundary vacuum elds   arrive b = 1 ms g s(,), b(,) . formula (8.6), (8.7) next split summation untwisted summation g-orbits one within orbits, summation one u one s/u. end choose (once all) arbitrarily set {} representatives set g-orbits set {} representatives classes s/u; precisely, symbol refer chosen representative orbit , chosen representative class s/u restricts u, i.e. satises |u= . (8.7) becomes b = m = m 1 mu 1 mu sj(,), mjg/u s(,), mjg/u g g bj(,) g(j) bj(,) . (8.8) second line used simple current relation (8.4), well fact identity matrix element s(,), vanishes g(j)6= 1 ju. latter observation shows boundary blocks b(,) contribute boundary state b character g equal one whole untwisted stabilizer u g, turn implies g g actually element g, i.e. g . (8.9) thus character g function g factorizes character g/u; according sequence (7.7), latter group identied s. see later, result perfectly natural. concentrate j-summation xed values . proceed, need tools. first, turns useful introduce every g every j g endomorphism (8.10) og,j := d1/2 xls/u g(l)ojl v , endomorphisms dened (4.11)a. inserting formula type . however, several dierent automorphism types may give rise one permutation g. instance, case wzw theories, automorphisms underlying nite-dimensional compact simple lie algebra g provide us automorphism type g, whenever automorphism g inner, associated map g identity. another example given inner automorphisms rational free boson theories whose xed point algebras correspond boson theory compactied integral multiple original radius; discussed subsection 16.1. 8 interchanging order summations, maps og,j also written form og,j = d2 xls/u = xls/u j(l) r (l) xls/u j(l) r (l) l, kg = j( kg) r ( kg) , g(l) f(l, l) (8.11) kg dened formula (7.19), g given g = g . (because g s, character g identity u s, required (7.19). also recall kg dened elements u; result (8.11) og,j independent choice representative.) |s help formula (8.11) one checks og,jl = g(l) og,j ls , (8.12) og,j og,j = f( kg, kg) ogg,j = e(g, g) ogg,j (8.13) g, g s, i.e. endomorphisms og,j g furnish projective representation stabilizer (in last equality used identity (7.21)). let us also see extent results depend choice representative . representative form |u = id; thus upon choosing dierent representative endomorphisms og,j get replaced og,j = ( kg) og,j . (8.14) hand, two-cocycle characterizes relevant representation depend choice. indeed, consequence kgg = kg kg modulo u maps og,j satisfy (8.15) next also choose set {j} representatives classes g/s write, every (8.16) og,j og,j = ( kg kg) og,jog,j = f( kg, kg) ogg,j . g s, g(j) (og,j id ) pj , g () g := mjg/s og,j dened (8.10) p projector a-module h isotypical component type h. owing identity (8.12), g fact independent choice representatives j (whereas og,j depend choice), (8.13) follows (8.17) g, g s. let us also note specializing a-vacuum sector, u = = g, simply kg = 1 hence og,j = id jg, () g(j)pj. g g = f( kg, kg) gg g =ljg 9 results hand, address j-summation appears formula (8.8). inserting denition (4.23)a boundary blocks b, nd mjg/u g(j) bj(,) = mjg/s = n d2 g(l) b(j,jl) g(j) mls/u mjg/s ( mls/u g(j) mls/u jl(l) r (l) id ) bj , g(l) (8.18) : v v + l-summation, becomes c non-degenerate linear form dened (4.21). performing mjg/u g(j) bj(,) = n mjg/s g(j) (j( kg) r ( kg) id ) bj = n b(g) (8.19) b(g) := b (g id ) . (8.20) b = b(1) (4.25), used via identity (4.17)a written form boundary blocks a-theory, given expression b b = n 1 = d1/2 b(j,) = n 1 mjg/s ms mjg/s ( xls/u mjg/s mls/u ol id ) bj = mjg/s b(j,l) (8.21) bj . point worth realizing twisted intertwining property (7.2) g formulated independently subalgebra a, hence g depends automorphism g itself, particular orbifold group g containing g considering. result (8.20), independence choice g holds quantities b(g) , too. inserting result (8.19) formula (8.8), nally see b = m 1 g nmu s(,), b(g) . (8.22) thus, summary, boundary state b entirely constructed information contained boundary blocks b together action carry character g g. see, implies g indeed constitutes automorphism type boundary condition . also seen boundary blocks b(,) contribute boundary state b stabilizer contains g (which, incidentally, shows factorization character g/u rather natural property elements s). regarded selection rule possible boundary blocks show boundary state; concrete form selection rule completely determined automorphism type boundary condition. 10 derivation also demonstrates case interest one associate automorphism chiral algebra every boundary condition. comes result analysis put assumption. contrast, subalgebra preserved boundary condition orbifold subalgebra ag, boundary condition need necessarily possess automorphism type. indeed, see section 16.3, conformally invariant boundary conditions z2-orbifold free boson, compactied rational radius squared, posses automorphism type. 9 twisted blocks twisted ward identities discussion automorphism types introduced, every primary label  a-theory every element g orbifold group stabilizes , map g (8.16) well linear form b(g) = b (gid ) (8.20) tensor product a-module h h+. refer latter linear forms g-twisted boundary blocks. demonstrated previous section, every boundary state b linear combination twisted boundary blocks b(g) twist g lies s. still remains established notation maps g intro- duced (8.16) agreement use notation section 7, i.e. maps satisfy g-twisted intertwining property (7.2). address issue, need information representation r subspaces decomposition (7.6) a-module h h irreducible a-modules. complete description action vertex operator algebra obtained simple current extension yet available, known results naturally suggest following structure. a-module v hj h element yj(z) (vj; z) vj hj h represented rj ( yj) . r(yj) = r (j) mjg/s (9.1) j dened j = jj (8.16)), rj ( yj) map hj hj properties j representative class g/s (see formula j . proceed use commutation r (j) r ( kg)= f(j, kg) r ( kg) r (j) = g(j) r ( kg) r (j) (id rj ( yj)) mjg/s (r (j) id ) .

(for theories free bosons, description terms (g g)/g established .) 12 10 classifying algebra c(g) automorphism type g 10.1 individual classifying algebras xed automorphism type restrict attention collection boundary conditions possess xed automorphism type g. according results section 8 corresponding boundary states written linear combinations twisted boundary blocks (8.20) xed g. suggests study analogous elements classifying algebra; accordingly introduce every g linear combination := |u| (g) |g| xjg/u g(j) j(,) (10.1) basis elements classifying algebra c( a), (which satises  ) representatives introduced paragraph formula (8.8). proceed, also note relation xjg/u g(j) sj(,), = (|g|/|u|) g,g s(,), (10.2) follows every g help simple current symmetry (8.4). (when g s, according remarks (8.8) expression vanishes.) using verlinde-like formula expresses structure constants c( a) terms diagonalizing matrix s, result (10.2) allows us compute product two elements c( a) form (10.1) (g) (g) = g,gx n(g) , (g) (10.3) (10.4) 4 n(g) , n(g) , ( a) := x g=g s(,), s( , ), s( ),( ,)1 . , means elements (g) g span subalgebra, even ideal classifying algebra c( a). call ideal c( a) individual classifying algebra automorphism type g denote c(g)( a). also, construction (g) linearly independent, hence furnish basis c(g)( a), i.e. every xed g g (10.5) clearly, c(g)( a) semisimple; one-dimensional irreducible representations obtained restriction c(g)( a) one-dimensional irreducible representations r c( a) satisfy g = g. g g span c( a). namely, associated every g-orbit  a-primaries moreover, following counting argument shows together elements (g) c(g)( a) = spanc{(g) | g} . 4 note expression dened g . 13 |u| many a-primaries , gives rise |s| many basis elements (g) . hand, g-orbit contains |g|/|s| many a-primaries, leading |s| many basis elements (,) c( a). help identities (7.9) among sizes various subgroups thus follows x |s| = x |s| . (10.6) qg ()=0 consequence indeed algebras c, distinguished bases related (10.1) isomorphism c( a) =mgg c(g)( a) . (10.7) decomposition may regarded expressing fact situation interest every boundary condition automorphism type. put dierently, algebra c( a) provides unied description boundary conditions |g| dierent automorphism types correspond elements g. special case trivial automorphism type, g = 1, use result  s(,), = s, g = 1 see ideal c(1)( a) nothing fusion rule algebra a-theory, recover known results  boundary conditions break bulk symmetries. also noticed precise form structure constants ideals c(g)( a) depend choice representatives (except g = 1, independence choice follows consequence simple current relation (8.4)). is, however, perfectly ne, twisted boundary block depends choice representatives well, fact manner cancel overall dependence physically meaningful quantities like one-point correlators bulk elds disk. independence c(g) orbifold group 10.2 remarkable feature formula (10.4) structure constants c(g)( a) automorphism type g enters restricting range summation. suggests individual classifying algebra automorphism type g fact depend specic orbifold subalgebra a, i.e. group g contains automorphism g, rather g alone. show indeed case, actually statement already applies relevant entries diagonalizing matrix s. recall section 8 (see remarks formula (8.21)) similar statement applies twisted boundary blocks b(g) . combined present result, according formula (8.22) independence property blocks b(g) , chiral quantities, extends (non- chiral) boundary states b. prove independence c(g)( a) choice orbifold group g containing g, convenient study orbifold respect cyclic group g := <g> = z|g| 14 (10.8) generated g. rst note diagonalizing matrix total classifying algebra c(a) boundary conditions preserving = a<g> given expression (5.9)a contains contributions involving various matrices sj (though special cyclic case formula simplies). however, expression structure constants c(g)(a) entries s(,), appear g s, entries turn indeed, since g generates <g>, latter property means particularly simple. stabilizer maximal, = g; duality relation u = g/s implies =u = 1. similarly, g = g monodromy charges respect extension denominator |g|, cannot xed point simple current g, implies also =u = 1. thus deal full g-orbits only; particular simple current summation formula reduces term j = 1: s, = |s |g| ||s ||u ||u | s, = |g| s, . (10.9) proceed, note algebra = a<g> obtained = ag simple current extension subgroup g := {jg | g(j) = 1} (10.10) simple current group g = g.

(10.14) furthermore, g = g simple current relation (8.4) implies entries identical one g-orbit. may therefore equate expression (10.14) average s. simple current relation matrices sj amounts restriction summation u , s(,), = |g||g | |s||u||s ||u | xju u (j) sj , (j) = |g|r|s ||u | |s||u| s, .
