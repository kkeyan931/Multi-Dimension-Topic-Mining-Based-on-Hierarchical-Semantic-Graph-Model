1 introduction

the strong t hooft-coupling limit of certain non-conformal supersymmetric quantum

eld theories associated with coincident non-conformal branes has a description in terms

of supergravity theory [1]. this description involves gauged supergravities admitting

domain-wall vacua [2]. the minkowski vacuum of the gauge theory at a given scale is a

horosphere of a supergravity dilaton domain wall, i.e. a hypersurface in the holographic

frame anti-de sitter (ads) metric on which the dilaton is constant [2]. the position of

the horosphere and the value of the dilaton is directly related to the energy scale of the

gauge theory. the domain wall solution itself therefore corresponds in the gauge theory

to renormalization-group (rg) ow from one scale to another. the cases considered in

[2], and similar lower-dimensional cases [3], are all ones for which the dilaton potential is a

simple exponential. in such cases there is no maximally-supersymmetric ads vacuum but

there is a 1/2 supersymmetric linear-dilaton vacuum which can be interpreted as a domain

wall. another type of domain wall, interpolating between ads vacua with dierent radii

of curvature, has been extensively studied in the context of d=4 supergravity [4, 5], and

similar solutions have recently been found for d=5 supergravity theories [6, 7, 8, 9]. these

domain walls correspond to rg ow from one superconformal eld theory to another.
other examples of rg ows of d = 4,n = 4 sym theory that have a description in terms
of d=5 supergravity can be found in [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. more recently, the rg ow

associated with domain walls has been used in the context of brane world scenarios to

explain the origin of mass hierarchies and as a possible explanation for the smallness of

the cosmological constant [16, 17, 18].

given these new applications of domain wall spacetimes, it would be helpful to have

a model-independent analysis of the possibilities in which basic physical requirements

are the only input. since matter elds other than scalars play no role in domain wall

solutions, the general framework is gravity coupled to a scalar eld theory in d spacetime
dimensions. the scalar elds will take values in some target space m and the model
is characterized by the metric on m, which determines the scalar kinetic terms, and a
function v on m, which determines the scalar potential. the target space metric must be
positive denite for vacuum stability. intuition from non-gravitational eld theory might

1

lead one to suppose that vacuum stability also requires that v be positive but in gauged

supergravity theories v is typically unbounded from below, and the supersymmetric

ads vacua are either maxima or saddle points of v [19]. the perturbative stability of

these ads vacua is guaranteed by the fact that the eigenvalues of the scalar mass matrix

satisfy the breitenlohner-freedman bound [20] or its d-dimensional generalization [21].

non-perturbative stability has also been established in many cases by an extension of

the spinorial proof of the positive energy theorem [22] to asymptotically ads spacetimes

[23, 24]. this method was used in [25, 26] to determine the restrictions on v that arise

from the requirement that there exist a stable ads vacuum, whether supersymmetric or

not. the results imply the perturbative stability bounds of [20, 21] but go well beyond

them by providing information about the potential away from its critical points.

this information is particularly useful if one supposes that there is only a single scalar
eld , which we shall call the dilaton. in this case m = r so the target space metric
is dieomorphic to a constant and v becomes a function of a single real variable. the

general model discussed above reduces to one with lagrangian density

l = q det g(cid:20) 1

2

r 

1
2

()2  v ()(cid:21)

(1)

where g is the d-dimensional spacetime metric with mostly plus signature. the result

of [26] is that vacuum stability requires v to take the form

v = 2(d  2)h(d  2)(w)2  (d  1)w2i

(2)

where w() is any function admitting at least one critical point and the prime indicates

dierentiation with respect to . we shall call w() the superpotential. the restriction

to a single scalar eld might appear severe but there are many supergravity theories

of interest for which there is only one scalar or for which it is natural to consider the

truncation to a single scalar. for example, in all eective supergravity theories associated

to string theory there is a natural truncation in which only the dilaton survives; hence

our choice of terminology. there are also some cases in which the potential depends

only on the dilaton even though this is not the only scalar eld. in many such cases the
potential is given by the above formula with log w   even though this superpotential
has no critical point. this suggests that the formula (2) is valid under conditions less

2

restrictive than those used in its derivation. notice also that a potential of the form (2)

for the multi-scalar case still guarantees gravitational stability [26] although the converse

is not necessarily true, i.e. in the multi-scalar case there may be more general potentials

than (2) compatible with gravitational stability. in particular, the potential of a subset

of the scalars of the d=5 supergravity used in recent studies [8, 9, 13] is of the form (2).

the potential (2) has a form that is typical in supergravity theories, hence the choice of

terminology superpotential for w, even though supersymmetry is not an ingredient in

its derivation.

in this paper we will investigate general properties of domain wall solutions in the

theory with lagrangian (1) with v given by (2). our interest in domain wall spacetimes

stems from their connection to the rg ow of the dual eld theories. such models are

characterized by their superpotential w. let us rst note that

v  = 4(d  2) [(d  2)w  (d  1)w] w

(3)

so that v has critical points at critical points of w, and at points for which w = d1

d2w.
in the context of supergravity theories the critical points of w yield stable ads vacua.

the other critical points of v yield non-supersymmetric (but usually ads) vacua which

may or may not be stable. recall that the positivity of the energy, and hence stability,

is established subject to prescribed boundary conditions at innity, so the fact that v

as given in (2) was derived by requiring the existence of a stable ads vacuum does not

imply that all of its ads vacua are stable; each such vacuum requires its own boundary

conditions.

in addition to ads vacua there will usually be domain wall solutions. these solutions

are possible, and may even be supersymmetric, regardless of whether v has critical points.

if v does have critical points then some of these domain wall solutions will interpolate

between the corresponding ads vacuum and some other solution, possibly another ads

vacuum. it is convenient to distinguish between two types of domain wall, the bps ones

and the non-bps ones. in the supergravity context the bps walls are supersymmetric,

and they interpolate between supersymmetric vacua. domain walls that interpolate

between a supersymmetric vacuum and a non-supersymmetric one, or between two non-

supersymmetric vacua, are necessarily non-bps. our focus will be on bps domain walls,

3

but we shall rst consider the general case.

2 domain walls and the c-function

we begin by making the domain-wall ansatz

ds2 = e2a(r)ds2(cid:16)e(1,d2)(cid:17) + dr2

(4)

with dilaton eld (r). let us introduce a new radial coordinate u = ea. the domain-

wall spacetime then takes the form

ds2 = u 2ds2(cid:16)e(1,d2)(cid:17) +

1

(ra)2

du 2
u 2 .

(5)

at critical points of v the dilaton is constant, as is (ra), and the geometry becomes

anti-de sitter with a cosmological constant  equal to the value of v at the critical point;
 =  1
2(d  1)(d  2)(ra)2. in the dual eld theory this corresponds to a conformal
xed point of the rg ow. the variable u is identied with the renormalization-group
scale; u =  corresponds to long distances in the bulk, so uv in the dual eld theory,
and u = 0 to short distances in the bulk, so ir in the dual eld theory. the rg ow of

the coupling constant(s) of the eld theory is encoded in the u dependence of the scalar

eld(s). at a xed point the scalar eld is constant, and the corresponding -function

vanishes.

the einstein-dilaton equations for the metric (4) reduce to

(d  2)(d  1)(ra)2  (r)2 + 2v () = 0
2(d  2)2
2
r  + (d  1)rar  v () = 0

r a + (d  1)(d  2)(ra)2 + (r)2 + 2v () = 0

(6)

(7)

(8)

where the prime again indicates dierentiation with respect to . not all three equations

are independent, however. for instance, one can obtain (7), upon dierentiation of (6)

and using (6) and (8). these equations imply

2
r a = 

1

d  2

(r)2.

4

(9)

in [6, 8] the function

c(u) = c0/ [ra(r)]d2

(10)

was proposed as a c-function, where c0 is a constant related to the universal coecient
appearing in the holographic weyl anomaly [27] (for odd d). by denition, a c-function

is a positive function of the coupling constant(s) that is non-increasing along the rg ow

from the uv to the ir. we can easily establish monotonicity:

u


u c = (d  2)c

1

(ra)2 2

ra!2
r a = c  r

 0,

(11)

where we have used (9). thus, as we move from the uv at u =  towards the ir at
u = 0, c is non-increasing. more generally, it was shown in [8] that the function c(u) is
monotonic as a consequence of a weaker energy condition on the bulk matter.

3 bps domain walls

the equations (7)-(8) are the euler-lagrange equations for the functional

e[a, ] =

1

2 z 



dr e(d1)ah(r)2  (d  1)(d  2)(ra)2 + 2vi .

(12)

the integrand is minus the eective lagrangian obtained by substitution of the domain

wall ansatz into the lagrangian (1), and the functional e is simply related to expressions

for the energy obtained by other means1.

the functional (12) can be rewritten, `a la bogomolnyi, as

e =

1

2 z 

dr e(d1)an[r  2(d  2)w]2  (d  1)(d  2)[ra  2w]2o

 2(d  2)[e(d1)aw]


.

(13)

it follows that e is extremised by solutions of the following pair of rst-order equations:

ra = 2w()
r = 2(d  2)w() .

(14)

1for example, use of the eld equations allows e to be expressed as a surface integral of the second

fundamental form, which was shown in [28] to be proportional to the energy.

5

it is straightforward to verify that solutions of these equations indeed solve the second-

order equations (6)-(8). we shall call solutions of these equations bps domain walls.

another way to arrive at the rst-order equations (14) is to note that the energy

bound established in [26] is saturated by eld congurations for which the equations

(dm + wm) = 0 ,

[mm  2(d  2)w]  = 0 ,

(15)

admit solutions for a non-zero spinor , which we shall call a killing spinor. such eld con-

gurations automatically solve the second-order einstein-dilaton equations. substitution

of the domain wall ansatz into the equations (15) leads immediately to the equations (14).
the killing spinor is  = ea/20 with 0 a constant spinor satisfying r0 = 0. in the
context of supergravity, the domain walls admitting killing spinors are supersymmetric.

4 examples

we now consider two examples involving the n = 1, d = 7 supergravity [29] and the

n = 2, d = 6 f (4) supergravity [30]. the d=7 theory is obtained by compactication of

d=11 supergravity on s4 [31], and it is associated with the near-horizon limit of the m5

brane with an orbifold projection on the transverse sphere [32, 33, 34]. the d=6 theory

is obtained by a warped s4-compactication of massive iia supergravity [35], and it is

associated with the near-horizon limit of the d4-d8 system [36, 37]. in both cases there

is a single scalar eld , and we may discuss them simultaneously. the potential is given

by (2) with

w() =

(16)

here g is the coupling constant of the gauge group and m is a topological mass parame-
ter. the potential has two critical points: at w = 0 and at w = d1
d2w. the two critical

points are

d2 =
e

m

d  5

,

d2 =

d  5,

(17)

only the rst (w = 0) critical point is supersymmetric.

domain-wall solutions of these supergravity theories, preserving 1/2 supersymmetry,

6

were found in [38]. in terms of a new radial parameter , they take the form

ds2 = e

2b

d3 ds2(e(1,d2)) + e2bd2,

 =

d  2
(d  4)

log  ,

(18)

where

eb = 2(d  4)d  2 w() .

(19)

there is an apparent singularity at the critical point w = 0 but this is only a coordinate

singularity, as one can verify by choosing u = e

b

d3 as a new radial variable. the metric

then becomes

ds2 = u 2ds2(e(1,d2)) +  d  3

eb!2 du 2
u 2 ,

which is non-singular when w = 0. the relation

(cid:20)w 

d  3
d  2

w(cid:21)w=0

= 0

(20)

(21)

is required in order for the domain wall solution to become the supersymmetric ads

solution as the critical point is approached. this relation turns out to be satised. in
the new radial coordinate the critical point is at u = , so it corresponds to a uv xed
point of the dual eld theory.

we conclude with an example of a superpotential admitting a bps domain wall but

which is not the superpotential of any known supergravity theory (at least not for general

d). a class of solutions of equations (14) is obtained by rst considering these equations

for complex , w(), a(r), and then imposing reality conditions2. as an example we

consider the case the superpotential w() is equal to the weierstrass elliptic function,

w() = (; g2, g3). the dilaton  is then the uniformizing variable of the elliptic curve

associated to the weierstrass function. let us recall some standard facts about the

weiersrass function, (; g2, g3). it satises the dierential equation,

2 = 43  g2  g3.

(22)

it follows that the superpotential has three critical points. the value of the superpotential

at the critical points is given by the three roots, e1, e2, e3, of the cubic polynomial in the

solutions of d=5 supergravity.

right hand side of (22). the critical points occur at  = 1,  = 1 + 2,  = 2, where

1 and 2 are the half periods of .

one can easily integrate equations (14). the result is

where r0 and a0 are integration constants, which we set to zero so that the critical points
occur for r = , and u = 0 or u = .

when g2, g3 are real one can impose reality conditions on the solution. there are two

cases to consider. when the discriminant  = g3

3 is positive, one may choose
primitive periods such that 1 is real and 2 is imaginary. in this case all three roots ei

2  27g2

(e1 > e2 > e3, e1 > 0, e3 < 0) are real. the (real) superpotential has one critical point

at  = 1 (the other two critical points occur for complex values of the dilaton). when

 < 0, one may choose 1, 2 to be complex conjugate of each other. the roots e1 and

e3 are complex conjugates and e2 is real. the (real) superpotential has one critical point

at  = 1 + 2. when two of the roots coincide, or what is the same, one of the periods

becomes innite, the weierstrass function reduces to an elementary function.
