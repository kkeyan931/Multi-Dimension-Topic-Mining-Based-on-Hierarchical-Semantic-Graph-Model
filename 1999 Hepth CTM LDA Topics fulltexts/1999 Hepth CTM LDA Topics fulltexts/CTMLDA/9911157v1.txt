abstract

the fischler-susskind entropy bound has been studied in (2+1)-dimensional uni-

verses with negative cosmological constant. as in all contracting universes, that bound

is not satised. furthermore, we found that the fischler-susskind bound is not compat-

ible with a generalized second law of thermodynamics in (2+1)-dimensional cosmology,

neither the classical nor the quantum version. on the other hand, the hubble entropy

bound has been constructed in (2+1)-dimensional cosmology and it is shown compatible

with the generalized second law of thermodynamics.

motivated by the well-known result in black hole theory that the total entropy of mat-

ter inside a black hole cannot exceed the bekenstein-hawking entropy, a conceptual change

in our thinking about gravity has recently been put forward by the so called holographic

principle [1,2]. according to this principle, all the degrees of freedom inside a volume is

expressed on its boundary, implying that the entropy of a system cannot be larger than

its boundary area. a specic generalization of the holographic principle to cosmology was

realized by fischler and susskind (fs) [3]. a remarkable point of their proposal is that the

holographic principle is valid for at or open universes with the equation of state satisfying
the condition 0  p  . however, for closed universes the principle is violated. the prob-
lem becomes even more serious if one investigates the universe with a negative cosmological

constant [4].

in that case the holographic principle fails, independently of whether the

universe is closed, open or at. various dierent modications of the fs version of the holo-

graphic principle have been raised recently, such as replacing the holographic principle by

the generalized second law of thermodynamics [5,4], using the cosmological apparent horizon

instead of the particle horizon in the formulation of holographic principle [6], changing the

denition of degrees of freedom [7] etc. a very recent result claimed that the holographic

principle in a closed universe can be obeyed if the universe contains strange negative pres-

sure matter [8]. the study of the cosmic holography has also been extended to pre-big-bang

string cosmological models [9]. all these studies have concentrated on (3+1)-dimensional

(4d) cosmology.

in our previous work, we have considered the investigations on cosmic holography in

(2+1)-dimensional (3d) cosmological models [10]. analogously to the 4d counterpart, the

holographic principle is satised in all 3d at and open universes, but breaks down for

3d closed universes. attempts to uphold the holographic principle by introducing negative

pressure matter as well as matter with very unconventional high pressure failed, because

they cannot accomodate any classical description after the big bang.

it is of interest to

generalize our discussions to 3d universes with a negative cosmological constant. there has

been many successful applications of the holographic principle for 3d pure anti-de sitter

(ads) space from string theory [11-14]. thus we have the motivation to investigate whether

the holographic principle holds in 3d ads cosmology.

recently a generalized second law (gsl) of thermodynamics in 4d cosmologies has

been put forward [15], and its relation to the hubble entropy bound (he) suggested by

2

veneziano [16] has also been discussed. further study of the gsl in 4d string cosmology

has been addressed as well [17]. the second purpose of the present paper is to consider

their discussions in 3d cosmological models. by establishing the gsl in 3d universes, and

studying its relation to fs entropy bound, we nd that the fs bound is not compatible

with neither the classical nor the quantum mechanical version of gsl. since the second law

of thermodynamics is more fundamental, the incompatible result between fs bound and

gsl gives us additional reason to look for a reformulation of the cosmological holographic

principle.

the conict result between the fs bound and the gsl can be attributed to the fact

that the fs bound is too strong and a weaker entropy bound in cosmology is called for.

in 4d universes it was claimed that the he bound, which is looser than the fs bound, is

sucient to avoid any problem with entropy produced at reheating after ination [16]. a

generalization of these studies to 3d universes is appealing and will be carried out in this

paper. we are going to dene the he bound and discuss its relation with the fs bound

and the bekenstein entropy (be) bound in 3d cosmological models. the relation between

he bound and gsl will also be addressed and the compatible result will be reached. these

results support the argument that the he bound may be a candidate to replace the fs

bound and describe the cosmic holography.

cosmological solutions in (2+1)-dimensional einstein gravity have been proposed in

[18,19]. in terms of the (2+1)-dimensional robertson-walker line element

ds2 = dt2  a2(t)(

1  kr2 + r2d2),

the einstein eld equations become

when the material content is a perfect uid with equation of state

where  is a constant, we derive the relation

p = (  1),

a2 = const = 0a2
0 .

(7)

where m0 = 0a2
0 . for  = 1, the universe is dust-lled and always expands regardless
of the value of k. however, for 1 <   2, the solutions of (7) are closed, open or at
cosmological models according to whether k is 1,1, or 0, respectively. the case  = 3/2
corresponds to the radiation-dominated universe.

it is of interest to investigate the holographic principle in a universe with negative vacuum

energy. a universe with negative cosmological constant is contracting, independently of the

value of k. for simplicity, we just consider the at universe (k = 0) with general equation of
state (1 <   2). the vacuum energy density is negative,  < 0, so that in the expanding
universe  =    =

0a2
0
a2  , and the friedmann equation can be expressed as

a2 =

2gm0
a22  a2.

the scale factor can be calculated and has the form

a(t) = (2gm0/)1/(2){sin[t]}1/.

(8)

(9)

as in the case discussed in [4,10], we nd that a vanishes at a = (2gm0/)1/(2), and

after that point a becomes negative and the universe collapses. this happens within a nite

time after the beginning of the expansion. one can nd the value of lh at the turning

point:

lh (turning) =

1

21/2 b((  1)/2, 1/2)

(10)

where b(p, q) is the euler beta function. it is worth noting that the particle horizon here

has the same dependence on  as that in 4d case [4]. putting these formulas together, we

get at the turning point

s
a  1/1/2.

(11)

considering   2, for small value of  (usually believed to be smaller than 10122), the
entropy over area bound is satised at the turning point. now we can consider what happens

2a0

near the nal stage of collapse, where the universe shrinks to the planck scale. by symmetry,
lh(turning)  1/21/2 [4] at this time. the scale factor at the planck
lh 
time t = 1 is a(t = 1) = (2gm0/)1/2{sin[]}1/. the ratio is s/a  1/21/2. hence

a(turning)

4

for small , the ratio is much bigger than unity for the universe with general equation of state
1 <   2. we nd that prior to the point of maximal expansion, the holographic constraints
hold. however once after the point where the ratio exceeds unity the holographic bound

cannot be further maintained. this result is in agreement with that in (3+1)-dimensions.

for comparison, we can easily see that in the general d-dimensional case, eq.(4) gets

d
dt

d
dt

(ad1) + p

(ad1) = 0, which in view of the equation of state (5) has
modied to
a solution   a(d1). going through calculations, we learn that eq(11) has the same
form, leading above to similar conclusions. from this point however, we rather stay in

2+1-dimensions where we are able to draw further conclusions.

as pointed out in [4], the problem can not be expected to be cured by replacing particle

horizon by the apparent horizon proposed in [6], because at the turning point a = 0, and

eq.(16) from ref.[6] diverges, that is,

4

3a2(t) a(t)  .

(12)

therefore the new holographic principle is violated even earlier.

we cannot naively expect the bound to be saved by considering the universe with the

unusual negative pressure matter analoguous to the 4d closed universe case [8], because as

we see from (8), after the big bang the universe cannot have sucient expansion for  < 1,

therefore the classical description is not valid.

it is appealing to establish the gsl in 3d universes and study the relation between

the gsl and the fs bound. using the idea proposed in [16], the denition of the total

entropy of a domain in 3d universes containing more than one cosmological horizons is

given by s = nh sh, where nh is a number of cosmological horizons within a given comoving
volume divided by a volume of a single horizon nh = a(t)2/|h(t)|2; sh is the entropy
within a given horizon. the classical gsl requires that the cosmological evolution must
obey ds  0, which corresponds to

nh tsh + tnh sh  0

(13)

adopting the idea used in the gsl for black hole, we consider that there could be

many sources and types of entropy, and the total entropy is the sum of their contributions.
supposing a single type of entropy is dominant, sh = |h|, where  indicates the type of

5

the entropy source, therefore s = (a|h|)2|h|, and eq(13) can be rewritten as

2h + (2 + )

h
h  0.

let us reexpress eqs.(2-4) in the forms,

k
a2

h 2 = 2g 
h = 2g(p + ) +
 + 2h(p + ) = 0

k
a2

(14)

(15)

and substitute them into (14). we nd that the relations for equations of state determined

by the gsl are

f or h > 0,

f or h < 0.

(16)

(17)

in the last terms of eqs(16,17), a2 corresponds to the energy of the whole universe, so
e = a2  k, thus the last terms in eqs. (16,17) can be neglected.

employing the rst law of thermodynamics, t ds = de + p dv = ( + p )dv + v d, the

temperature can be obtained by t 1 = (

s
e

)v =

s


, where e = v, s = sv , therefore

t =

1

g(2 + )|h|

(18)

to ensure that singularities are avoided for the expressions of the total entropy s, ts

and the temperature t when a at space limit of vanishing h is taken into account, the
reasonable physical range of  should lie within the region 1    0.

let us now consider that the dominant contribution to the entropy of the universe is given

by the geometric entropy sg whose source is the existence of a cosmological horizon [20,21].

this is a speculative notion introduced in [15]. let us herewith suppose that a component

of entropy arises from geometry. we are thus in a position to discuss the relation between

the gsl and the fs entropy bound. for a system with a cosmological horizon, sh

g is given

by

g = |h|1g1
sh
n ,

(19)

which corresponds to  = 1. substituting this value of  into eqs.(16,17), equations of
state corresponding to adiabatic evolution with dominant sg are obtained. for the expanding

6

universe h > 0, and gsl requires p  , which is in agreement with the results obtained
in [10] for the fs bound. however for negative h, which corresponding to the contracting
universe, gsl requires p/  (1,). this range corresponds to  > 2 in eq.(5), which is
ruled out in any 3d contracting universes in fs bound discussions. therefore, for the 3d

contracting universes the fs bound is not compatible with the gsl.

whether adding a missing quantum entropy term and developing the quantum mechan-

ical version of the gsl can help us arriving at the compatibility between the fs bound and

the gsl for contracting 3d universes is still not clear. using the denition for the quantum
entropy in 4d cases [15], dsquan. = dnh , where  is a chemical potential, always taken
to be positive, nh = (ah)2, we obtain

ds = dsclass. + dsquan.

= dnh sh + nhdsh  dnh

(20)

where sh is the classical entropy within a cosmological horizon and sh = |h| if the classical
entropy is dominated by a single source. the quantum modied gsl can be expressed as

(2h + 2

h
h

)nh (sh  ) + 

h
h

nh sh  0.

(21)

considering that geometric entropy still dominates the classical entropy,  = 1, we learn
from (21) that

for the contracting universe, h < 0.

(22)

if   sh, it returns to the classical case and leads to

p

p

are comparable to classical eects,   sh ,
say   sh ,
fs bound, because

p


> 1 or 1 <

which are all unacceptable by the fs bound in all contracting universes. therefore the

quantum consideration still cannot lead to the compatibility between the fs bound and the

gsl.

since we believed that the second law of thermodynamics is a fundamental principle in

physics, such an incompatible result gives us additional motivation to seek for the reformu-

lation of the cosmic holographic principle. one may attribute the incompatibility to the

7

argument that fs bound is too strong, a looser cosmic entropy bound is called for to solve

this conict with gsl. a possible way was suggested by veneziano for 4d cosmology [16]

by replacing the fs bound by the he bound. based upon the argument that a black hole

larger than h 1 cannot form, generalizing to 3d cases we nd the largest entropy in a region
corresponding to have just one black hole per hubble volume h 2 is that s  m 2
p|h|,
where mp = g1/2

n , and the he bound in 3d universes can be dened as

recalling the denitions for the be bound and the fs bound, in 3d they can be expressed

sh  m 2

p|h|1  she

(23)

as

sbe  el/h  m dp/h  d2
sf s  dp/h  dp/l2

p

p  dp/h  h 2d2

p  dp/l2

p

(24)

(25)

where dp is the particle horizon, lp 
by h 1, and consider that when applied to non-inationary cosmology, they are about the

h  mp. we substitute the particle horizon dp

same [22]. thus in 3d cases we can reproduce the relation among dierent entropy bounds

rst obtained in 4d cases [16],

she = s1/2

f s s1/2

be

(26)

it is easy to see that the he bound is much looser than the fs bound.

the most attractive point now is to study whether the he bound is compatible with

gsl in 3d cosmological models. assuming a single dominant entropy form, sh = (|h|
mp
bound (23) can be written as

),

p|h|1
considering the reasonable physical region of , we need

)  m 2

(|h|
mp

|h|  mp  m 1/+1

p

.

(27)

(28)

from the he bound, we learn that |h| has a maximum value, therefore in order not to
violate this bound we need for expanding universe h > 0, the evolution of the 3d universe
undergoes decelerated expansion, say h > 0, h < 0. gsl allows such an evolution. since
in the physical region 1    0, eq(14) reads

2h + (2 + )

> 2h +

h
h  0

h
h

8

(29)

for h < 0, it leads directly to a requirement for the equation of state, that is,   p . this
is quite natural and thus the entropy bound is valid without violation of gsl.

for a contracting universe with h < 0, to satisfy the entropy bound, we need the universe
to experience decelerated contraction, namely h > 0. this requirement is obviously not

compatible with gsl, because eqs(14)and (29) tell us that

2|h|2   h

(30)

which is false for h > 0.

luckily this conict between he bound and gsl can be resolved by considering the

quantum modied gsl (21). for contracting 3d universes, h < 0, and eq(21) can be

rewritten as

2|h|2nh (sh  )   h[2nh sh  2nh + nh sh ].

(31)

neglecting the quantum eect,   sh, eq(31) boils down to (30) for  = 1. however if
we consider that the quantum eect is strong, namely sh   < 0, we can rewrite eq(31)
as

for decelerated contraction h > 0, eq(32) certainly holds. thus considering the quantum

eect, the conict between he bound and gsl can be overcome.

in summary we have found that analogously to 3d closed universes, fs bound in 3d

cosmological models with negative cosmological constant breaks down regardless of the value

of k. unlike the 4d closed universe [8], here the negative pressure matter cannot be used to

save the fs bound. establishing the gsl in 3d cosmologies, we have shown that the state

equations required are not consistent with those needed by fs bound, which shows that fs

bound and gsl are not compatible. furthermore we have shown that the conict cannot

be resolved by taking account of the quantum modied version of gsl, which has not been

addressed in 4d cases. considering that the gsl is a fundamental principle in physics,

we have further motivations to rethink the expression of cosmic holography. extending

dierent cosmic entropy bounds to 3d cosmology, we have reproduced the relation between

he bound, be bound and fs bound rst obtained in 4d cases [16]. compared to fs bound,

he bound is looser, and compatible with gsl. this result agrees with that claimed in 4d

cosmology [15] and supports the argument that he bound is a candidate for describing

9

it is of interest to consider generalization of our discussions on the

relation between gsl and cosmic entropy bound to higher dimensional spacetimes.
