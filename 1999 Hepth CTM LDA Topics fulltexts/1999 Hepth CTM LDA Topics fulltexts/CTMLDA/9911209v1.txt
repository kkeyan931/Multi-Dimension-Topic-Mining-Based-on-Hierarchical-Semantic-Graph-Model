abstract

we nd monopole solutions for a spontaneously broken su (2)-higgs
system coupled to gravity in asymptotically anti-de siter space. we
present new analytic and numerical results discussing, in particular, how
the gravitational instability of self-gravitating monopoles depends on the
value of the cosmological constant.

1 introduction

gravitating monopole solutions to gauge theories have attracted many investi-
gations in the last 25 years [1]-[15]. in particular, the existence of self-gravitating
monopoles in spontaneously broken non-abelian gauge theories, their proper-
ties, relation with black hole solutions and their relevance in cosmology have
been thoroughly discussed. most of these investigations correspond to asymp-
totically at space-time but there have been recently several studies for the case
in which the cosmological constant  is non-vanishing [16]-[18]. in particular,
we have discussed in [18] the existence of gravitating monopole solutions in the
case in which space-time is asymptotically anti-de sitter (ads), which in our
conventions corresponds to  < 0. regular (monopole and dyon) and singular
(black hole) solutions have been found in this case and the properties of the
magnetically charged solutions for vanishing newton constant g were analysed.
it is the purpose of the present work to complete the investigation initiated
in [18] studying in detail the monopole solution in asymptotically ads space
both for vanishing and nite g, analytically and numerically. the plan of the
paper is the following: we present in section ii the model, the spherically sym-
metric ansatz and the appropriate boundary conditions leading to gravitating

monopoles and dyons. then, in section iii, we discuss, analytically, some rele-
vant properties of the magnetically charged solution and then describe in detail
the numerical results both for g = 0 and g 6= 0. we summarize and discuss
our results in section iv.

2 the model

we consider the action for su (2) yang-mills-higgs theory coupled to gravity in
asymptotically anti-de-sitter space. the action is dened as

with

where g is the newton constant, e the gauge coupling and  is the cosmological

the most general static spherically symmetric form for the metric in 3 spatial
dimensions together with the thooft-polyakov-julia-zee ansatz for the gauge
and higgs elds in the usual vector notation reads

g = (x) a(x)2 d2t + (x)1 d2r + r2 d22
~a = dt e h0 j(x) er  d (1  k(x)) e + d (1  k(x)) sin  e
~h = h0 h(x) er

(11)

where we have introduced the dimensionless coordinate x  e h0 r and h0 sets
the mass scale ([h0] = m1).

using this ansatz, the equations of motion take the form

the boundary conditions

ansatz (11) will lead to well behaved solutions for the matter elds if, at x = 0,
one imposes

 h(x)/x and j(x)/x are regular;
 1  k(x) and k(x) go to zero.
 (x)  1
on the other hand we want the system to go asymptotically to anti-de sitter
space which corresponds to the solution of the einstein equations with  < 0 in
absence of matter (see next section); for this to happen we must impose that
the matter energy-momentum tensor vanishes at spatial innity. from eq.(10)
one can see that the appropriate conditions for x   are

a(x)  1
k(x)  o(x1 )
h(x)  h + o(x12 )
j(x)  j + o(x3 )

(19)

with i > 0, i = 1, 2, 3.

note that, being the equations for a and  rst order, we impose just one

condition for each one.

3 the system in ads space

we shall rst consider the case in which the newton constant g vanishes, so
that the gravitational equations decouple from the matter and then analyse the
full g 6= 0 problem.
in the former case we have already studied in [18] the
classical equations of motion analytically, showing that monopoles could exist
in asymptotically anti-de sitter spaces and discussed its main properties. we
present in the next subsection the numerical evidence that this solutions do
exist, thus completing the analysis in [18]. then, we extend our study to the
g 6= 0 case and again present both analytical and numerical analysis showing
the existence of monopole solutions provided g is smaller than a critical value
gc.

the g = 0 case

taking the 0h0

2  0 limit, one easily nds for the metric the solution

a(x) = 1
(x) = 1 + 0 x2

(20)

which is nothing but the vacuum solution of the einstein equations with a cosmo-
logical constant (assumed negative), and corresponds to a neutral schwarzschild
black hole in ads space. concerning the integration constant a, it is related to
the mass of the black hole and will be put to zero in what follows, in agreement
with the condition imposed on  at x = 0. this metric, in turn, acts as a (ads)
background with radius r0,

r0 =p3/

for the yang-mills-higgs system.

for simplicity we study eqs.(16) in the bps limit which corresponds to

/e2 = 0 with h0 xed.

the total amount of matter m associated to the solution of (22) is dened

it is not dicult to see from these expression that the boundary conditions
imposed through eqs.(19) are precisely those required for niteness of m .

as stated above, analytical arguments showing the possibility of monopole
solutions were presented in [18]. to begin with, let us note that is possible to
perform a power series expansion for large x and calculate the coecients in the
expansion recursively. one can consistently propose an expansion of the form

k(x) =

k+1

x+1 (cid:18)1

x2+4 + . . .(cid:19)

(26)

and, after insertion in eqs.(22), one can determine the coecients k, h and j
recursively. for positive integer  one has

k =

k+1

( + 2) (2 + 3)

(27)

similar expressions can be obtained for  a positive semi-integer.

when such an expansion are assumed, non-trivial solutions exist if and only

if

h 2


= ( + 1)0 ,

 =

1
2

, 1,

, 2, . . .

(28)

if one relaxes a power behavior like in (26), then one again gets a relation
like (28) but with  a real number, the leading exponent in the asymptotic
expansion of k(x). it is important to note that, having ads space a natural
scale r0, the system trades the in principle arbitrary h0 dimensionfull parameter

for the ads radius r0 =p3/ which now sets the scale,

| ~h()|2 = ( + 1)0h2

0 = ( + 1)(ero)1

(29)

then, using (28) for  real and a given  is equivalent to consider an integer 
(for example with  = 1) provided r0 (i.e. ) is changed accordingly.

to obtain a detailed prole of the monopole solution, we solved numeri-
cally the dierential equations. for simplicity we considered the j = 0 case
corresponding to a purely magnetic solution. the equations of motion read

((x)k(x)) = k(x)(cid:18) k(x)2  1

x2
(x2(x)h(x)) = 2 h(x) k(x)2

+ h(x)2(cid:19)

(x) = 1 + 0x2

(30)

(31)
(32)

we employed a relaxation method for boundary value problems [19]. such
method determines the solution by starting with an initial guess and improv-
ing it iteratively. the natural initial guess was the exact prassad-sommereld
solution [20] (which corresponds to 0 = 0). we have found regular monopole
solutions for any value of the cosmological constant . we present in figure 1

6

the solution prole for dierent values of . a distinctive feature of solutions
for  6= 0 compared with the at-space prasad-sommereld solution concerns
the asymptotic behavior of the elds.
indeed, when  6= 0, the higgs eld
approaches its v.e.v. faster than in the prasad-sommereld (ps) case,

h(x)  h +

c6=0

, x  1

h p s(x)  h

x

, x  1

(33)

(34)

as a result of this change of the asymptotic behavior, one can see that the radius
rc of the monopole core decreases. indeed, as can bee seen in fig.1, when 0
(the cosmological constant) grows, rc becomes smaller as the magnetic eld
concentrates near the origin.

we have also computed numerically the monopole mass which can be written

as

m =

4
e2

1
r0

f0(/e2)

(35)

where, extending the usual at space notation, we have introduced the dimen-
sionless function f0(/e2). in the present case, the cosmological constant pro-
vides a natural scale and this has been exploited in (35). this formula can be
written in units of the mass scale h0 as

4
e
where e is a dimensionless function of 0,

m
h0

=

e

e = 0f0(/e2)

(36)

(37)

we present in figure 2 a plot for e as a function of 0 where one can see

that lim00 0f0(0) = 1 which is the correct result for prasad-sommereld

monopoles in at space.

the g 6= 0 case

in order to study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to eqs.(13) we have
taken as independent metric functions a(x) and (x) = a(x)(x). moreover,
identifying h0 = (er0)1 (0 = 1), the equations to study become, in the bps
limit,

a(x) (x (x)) = (1 + 3 x2) a(x)2  0h0
x (x)2 a(x) = 0h0

(38)

where, in the rst one, we have combined eqs.(12) and (13).

we consider for simplicity the purely magnetic case, j = 0, and propose a

power series expansion of the form

(39)

again, coecients can be determined recursively. the leading coecients in
the expansions for k and h coincide with those already presented for 0 = 0
(eq.(26)). we then just quote the corresponding ones for the metric functions
(for  a positive integer)

(x) = 1 + x2 +

2 ,1(cid:19)

we see that function a is completely determined, to all orders, in terms of h and
k coecients. as an example, and from the numerical results described below,
one nds for  = 1 and 0 = 0.1 that 1 = 0.24, k2 = 0.73, h3 = 0.32 and
then a6 = 0.87.
concerning the asymptotic expansion for  corresponds to a reissner-nord-
strom metric (with cosmological constant), with the free parameter 1 related
to the gravitatory mass and the coecient of the 1/x2 term, which arises for
charged solutions, precisely corresponding to the qm = 1 magnetic solution we
are considering. as seen from afar, and for an appropriate set of parameters,
the metric can be identied with that of a magnetically charged black hole as
that described in [18],[21]. concerning the expansion for k, it has one free
coecient (k+1), while for the expansion for h two coecients remain free
(h and h3).

in order to get the detailed prole of the solutions, we have again to solve
numerically the equations of motion. for simplicity, we have considered the
bps limit, /e2 = 0. employing the same relaxation method as for the g = 0
case we have found a self-gravitating monopole solution satisfying the boundary
conditions previously discussed. solutions are similar to those corresponding to

8

asymptotically at space [6]-[12]. in particular, we have found a maximum value
for the gravitational interaction strength 0 such that above c
0 the solution
ceases to exist. this eect, already encountered in asymptotically at space, can
be understood noting that as 0 increases from 0 to its critical value, the ratio
m = mass/radius for the monopole solution also increases until it becomes
gravitationally unstable. now, as the cosmological constant || increases, the
radius of the monopole decreases (the behavior for 0 6= 0 is analogous to that
depicted in fig.1 for 0 = 0) while the mass of the monopole increases (the
behavior for 0 6= 0 is analogous to that in fig.2) so that m is a monotonically
growing function of  or, what is the same, of 0. this explains why the
critical value c
0(0) for 0 > 0, is smaller than the asymptotically at one,
c
0(0) < c
0(0): the critical value mc at which the solution collapses is reached
before, in the  domain, for 0 > 0 than for 0 = 0. as an example, for  = 0
and 0 = 1 the critical 0-value is c
0(1) = 1.374 to be compared with the
asymptotically at space value c

0(0) = 5.549.

concerning the solution for the metric, as can be seen in fig. 3, /(1 + 0x2)
has a minimum which decreases as the strength of the gravitation interaction
grows and tends to zero as 0  c
0. a similar behavior can be seen to occur for
a(x) which has also a minimum at the origin which tends to zero as 0  c
0.
as in the case of asymptotically at space, a develops a step-like behavior which
becomes more and more sharp as c
0 is approached. the position of the center
of the step function can be used to determine the corresponding value of the
horizon, which for ads spaces results from the solution of a quartic algebraic
equation. [21],[18]

4 discussion

in this work we have studied in detail the monopole and dyon solutions to
yang-mills-higgs theory coupled to gravity for asymptotically anti-de sitter
space presented in ref.[18]. we have rst considered the case in which the
newton constant 0 vanishes so that the einstein equations decouple leading
to a schwarzschild black hole in ads space. this metric acts as a background
for dyon solutions which were studied in detail making both an analytical and a
numerical analysis. a distinctive feature of ads solutions in this case is that the
monopole radius is smaller than that corresponding to the  = 0 case. apart
from this property, qualitatively, the higgs eld and magnetic eld behavior
is very similar to that corresponding to the t hooft-polyakov solution. more
interesting is the behavior of solutions where gravity is eectively coupled to
the matter elds. in rst place, as it happens in asymptotically at space, a
critical value for the newton constant exists above which no regular monopole
or dyon solution can be found. this eect was explained in asymptotically at
spaces [4]-[15] by noting that as 0 grows the mass of the monopole grows and
its radius decreases so that it nally becomes gravitationally unstable. now,
the presence of a cosmological constant enhances this eect and for this reason,
the critical value we nd, c

0() is smaller than the asymptotically at one.
