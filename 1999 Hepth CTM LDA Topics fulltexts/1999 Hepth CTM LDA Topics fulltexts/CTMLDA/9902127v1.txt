abstract

the eld-theoretical description of quantum uctuations on the
background of a tunneling eld  is revisited in the case of a functional
schrodinger approach. we apply this method in the case when quan-
tum uctuations are coupled to the  eld through a mass-squared
term, which is time-dependent since we include the dynamics of  .
the resulting mode functions of the uctuation eld, which determine
the quantum state after tunneling, display a ,previously unseen, reso-
nance eect when their mode number is comparable to the curvature
scale of the bubble. a detailed analysis of the relation between the
excitations of the eld about the true vacuum (interpreted as particle
creation) and the phase shift coming from tunneling is presented.

introduction.

false vacuum decay through barrier penetration has been studied extensively
by a number of authors [1-10]. however there is a lot to be understood yet
about tunneling phenomena, especially if one considers its importance as
related to the very early universe. tunneling is often related to the existence
of a potential barrier ,but while in quantum mechanics (qm) that barrier is
in real space, in quantum eld theory (qft) one has penetration from one
eld conguration to another.
in qft the eect of a tunneling potential
can even be produced through the spatial gradient of the eld. thus the
potential barriers in (qm) and (qf t ) have a dierent nature.

it is well known that tunneling in qft is a large uctuation or instability
of vacuum, a classically forbidden process where energies are not eigenstates
of the hamiltonian due to barrier penetration. since particle creation is
another phenomena related to vacuum uctuation [11-18] it is of interest
to probe tunneling via studying the relation between particle creation and
tunneling.

the tunneling amplitude depends strongly on h since it is the exponen-
tial of the negative euclidean action divided by h, while particle creation
is insensitive to it. for more details see [7,9]. thus, the question we ask
here is: what is the relation between tunneling and particle creation in the
dynamic background of the bubble that forms in false vacuum decay? we
will consider the functional schrodinger equation for a quantum eld  in a
tilted quartic potential v () (g. 1). the eld is split into a classical part, 
(hereafter the tunneling eld) undergoing phase transition from false to true
vacuum, and the uctuation eld,  around , giving rise to particle creation
through coupling to  with a mass-squared term, m2().the classical eld
 is dened as usual to be the one that extremizes the action. in this case,
assuming an wkb ansatz for the wavefunctional, (section 2 reviews this for-
malism), is constistent with the denition of , since the expectation value
for the lowest order wkb type solution recovers the classical solution  in
the appropriate limit. however generally this statement would not be true
particularly in the cases when there are more than one degree of freedom and
the wkb branches are not decohered. the multidimensional tunneling in
wkb formalism was initially developed by banks, bender and wu [5] and
later revisited and improved by t. vachaspati and a. vilenkin [6,7] as well
as the kyoto group [hamazaki et al 8,9].

2

the reason for using this method is twofold:

- it allows us to relate the dominant escape path,dep [22], of  to the the
usual formalism of particle creation [11,12], i.e.
relate the uctuations 
around the dep of the -eld to the particles produced as the result of tun-
neling.
- while the approach is similar to qm (i.e.
solving a schrodinger equa-
tion) there is a clear relation with the second quantization picture (shown
rigorously by [2,3,7,8]).

the method follows closely [7,9] and we review the formalism in sect.
2. the ansatz of the wavefunctional is assumed to be a superposition of
gaussian packets centered around the classical vacuum outside the barrier
and around the dep under the barrier. one then solves the functional
schrodinger equation for the -eld and the uctuation -eld on the back-
ground of , with the appropriate boundary conditions at the inner turn-
ing point. the wavefunctional that describes the quantum state of the two
elds,i.e. that gives the amplitude for the elds to be in conguration ,
, is a 1-parameter family of solutions (the parameter can be thought of
as a time-coordinate) and is analytically continued from under the barrier
through the turning point, to the region of the true vacuum. the solution for
the uctuation eld is given in section 3. when the solution is analytically
continued, one ends up with a squeezed state of mixed positive and negative
frequencies. the coecient of the negative frequency component than allows
one to determine the particle creation number in each mode.

we nd an interesting new feature for the uctuations, namely resonance,
by taking into account the dynamic of the background eld . a discussion
of the results and open issues to be tackled in the future is given in section
4.

all along we have assumed the o(4)-symmetry and the thin wall approx-
imation. in the appropriate limit our result recovers those obtained by the
kyoto group [8,9].

2. review of the functional schrodinger formalism

the application of this formalism in connection with vacuum tunneling in
qft was initially developed by banks, bender and wu [5] and later on
revisited and improved by [2,3,7,8,9]. we consider a scalar eld in minkowski

fig.1 the potential for false vacuum decay via tunneling
we want to study the uctuation eld around the dominant escape path
(i.e. around the tunneling eld ). thus we split the eld into the classi-
cal/tunneling eld  and uctuations around , denoted by , i.e.  =
 +  .

under the barrier,  interpolates between the 2 vacuum states by taking
the dominant escape path. the solution for the -eld in the case of potential
v () is studied by many authors through the use of instantons in the dilute
gas approximation under the barrier, or by means of wkb and loop expan-
sion methods outside the barrier.it has been shown that both perturbation
methods (dilute gas of instantons inside and 1-loop approximation outside
the barrier) match consistently at the turning point,only when the continuous
symmetries of the problem (in our case o(4)) are the same under the barrier
and outside, where one is nding solutions around   . outside) [2,3].
this matching procedure can be quite complicated if one breaks dierent
subgroups of the continuous symmetries inside and outside the barrier.

as noted earlier, we split the elds in 2 parts: , the classical eld
( where s
|= = 0) and ,the uctuation eld. the false vacuum is
located at    a 
8a3 + o(2), where v ()  0 + o(2). the true
vacuum is located at +  a 
8a3 + o(2) ,where v (+)   + o(2)
. then the lagrangian for the ( + )-elds becomes
()2  v ()(cid:27) +
2n()2  m2()2o = l + l (2.1)
where m2() = 2v
2 and (  m2()) = 0 we have ignored higher
order terms in the potential that would have contributions of order 3
and higher. this is a consistency requirement for matching the two
dierent perturbation methods at the turning point. when we solve
the functional schrodinger equation, the solution for the -eld under
the barrier will contain terms up to (h2) coming from the zeros in
det1/2 |   + v ()|, where
s0 is the action of the bounce in 4-dim. these zeros are related to
the 4 translational symmetries of the problem, and it has been shown
(see coleman [19]) in the dilute gas approximation that each symmetry
brings a (h1/2) factor, so counting zeros in k is equivalent to counting
powers in the coupling constants. further, gervais, vegas, sakita,
[2,3] have shown that for the problem at hand, expansion around the
vacuum states, outside the barrier, which in our case corresponds to +,
matched (analytically continued) with the solution under the barrier
is in complete agreement with the multi-instanton (dilute gas approx.)
approach [1]. thus we can keep terms up to 2 in the lagrangian and
ignore higher order terms.

we work with the functional schrodinger equation and use the results
of vachaspati and vilenkin [7] for the background eld .

use the following coordinate system ([9])



rm =  sinh

where rm, tm are the minkowski radius and time. the minkowski line
element written in the new coordinates is: ds2 = d2 + 2[d2 +
sinh2 d2r]. in the euclidean region, under the barrier, the coordinates
are:

e  i

variable s of the previous section 2.2.

(2.4) boundary condition and particle creation in functional

schrodinger and 2nd quantization picture.
the eld  interpolates under the barrier between the 2 values, , +,
and  > e > 0, 2
e = x2 +  2. we want  to reach false vac-
uum when e  ,   , and the uctuation eld  to die
out there (i.e.
at e   the eld is in the false vacuum ()
ground state), i.e.   eikx+ where  <  < 0, or equivalently
  ee for e  . the in and out frequency is dened as usual
by +/ = [k2 + m2(+/)]1/2.the eld reaches the turning point at
 = t = 0 and from then on has damped oscillations around the true
vacuum + outside the barrier, i.e.

at

e =  = 0( = t = 0),   + (where 0 < t < ).

when t  ,

(   eikxi+t

.

therefore we analytically continue the solution for  at the turning
point e =  = 0, and compare it with what should have been a
positive frequency wave in minkowski region around   +, i.e. with
(2.2)

  eikx+t

in general the analytically continued solution diers from (2.2) in that
it contains a mixing of positive and negative frequency. this is to

7

be expected since the analytically continued solution from under the
barrier contains the dynamics of the -eld interpolating between 2
values and thus the phase change is reected and carried over when one
continues that solution outside, in minkowski region. these excitations
are interpreted as particle creation.

in the second quantization picture, the existence of a mass-squared
term that is time()-dependent would produce the phenomena of
particle production. thus  is in a time-dep. background of  and
it has been shown by [7,9] that both, functional shrodinger and 2nd
quantization are equivalent methods in the calculation of particle cre-
ation.

3. solution for the fluctuation field (, , )

in the euclidean region,the equation for the uctuation eld1, which is de-
rived from the hamiltonian in section 2.2 is

(3.1)

sinh2 (cid:16)sinh2 (cid:17) + 2
in the minkowski region the operator is bl2 = 1
sinh2  .
also in the euclidean region p takes discrete values from 0 to  while in the
minkowski region the spectrum becomes continuous [21]. we can write

(3.2)

e has eigenfunctions fpm such that

and

(e ) = a tanh[(e  r)]

as shown in section (2.2) equation (3.3) is a schrodinger equation of a par-
e  m2(e ).thus the

the regions of interests are region ii, and h. we nd the solutions in
those regions and match them. however, we included regions iii and i
as separate, in order to indicate that the potential is nearly constant there.
these latter regions were thus used to check the right asymptotic behaviour
of the solutions found in the regions of interest.the turning points are:

we will nd the exact solutions in the 4 regions and match them and their
rst derivatives at the turning point. note that if p  (nr)2 for large
values of n, then the v0 dened above or the originial potential, to a very
good accuracy, simply becomes v0 =  p
-term dominates the
tanh2  and thus the distinction between the rst three regions dissapears.
in this case our result recovers that of the kyoto group [to within a prefactor]
[1,9] as it should since they take the mass term, m[] in the equation 3.4 for
the potential, to be a constant. for suciently small values of p, one has
p  (r)2,in which case the e dependence of m2(e)-term should not be
ignored since it produces interesting eects. the solutions for the 4-regions

the reason we choose u(b,z) is because around the turning points {x1, x2}
they reduce to airy functions i.e. have the right behavior and are solutions
there too. (if we were to use w kb we would have airy functions by approx-
imating v0 with a straight line around the turning points.) the asymptotic

(time-depend. mass) while others have considered a constant mass-term or a
step-function, and this dynamics of m2() revealed an interesting phenomena,
resonant particle production.

almost constant mass term studied previously by kyoto group [8] and we
have studied the case 0  p  2r2  n2, (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .) when the time-
dependence of mass is important and cannot be neglected anywhere, i.e.
when the curvature of the bubble becomes important.

the most interesting feature that comes from taking into account the
time-dependence of the mass-term, i.e. the curvature of the bubble (back-
ground) is that for momentum p comparable to the curvature scale of the
bubble - r we get a strong enhancement of particle production, a res-
in this case, p  n22r2, the exponential factor becomes
onance eect.
in this
approximately zero and np 
case the very high momentum (p  (r)2, see gure 3.3) all the sinusoidal
functions become hyperbolic (the argument becomes imaginary) and the par-
ticle production rate dies out very fast as expected.

1) thus, for momentum less than the scale of the bubble np is very

small due to the factor e4r.

2) for large momentum (p  nr) one gets again a very small np
suppressed by the factor e2p. in this case there is only one region:
v0 = p

e  42 and np  e2p, as previously found [8].

3) only for momentum comparable to the scale of the bubble (p  nr),
(n takes only a few integer values) one gets a resonant particle produc-
tion. formula (3.19) contains cases (1) and (2) as limiting cases and
those have been previously studied by kyoto [8,9]. our results agree
with theirs within a prefactor.

the result is that particle production is suppressed in the thin wall
case with the exception of those modes that can resonate with the
bubble, and those modes are not suppressed but enhanced (not shown
previously), i.e. modes with phase p  n  3 = n  2r can see
an almost transparent barrier. if the barrier was time-dependent i.e.
r = r(t) one would expect intuitively a larger range of modes to
resonate with the barrier. this has to be investigated yet, (using for
e.g.
[10] model) (n is an integer. only a few values of np give a
strong resonance, because of the suppression term e2p22 competing
with the resonance eect when p is large. see (gure 3.2, gure 3.3).

4. discussion.

if we did not distinguish between uctuation and classical elds, uctuations
are the ones that contribute to the phase shift of the wave functional and give
rise to particle production at the same time. particle production is calculated
in real time, after the analytic continuation of dep outside. thus it is the
total phase shift coming from tunneling/dep that gives rise to particle
production. further, on support of the above, notice that the parameter s
plays the role of time. under the barrier s < 0, outside s2 > 0 where

z d3xh[(x, s)] = h(s) =

s2 + u(s),( s2 = x2 +  2

ms > 0

also, in a qm picture s is an operator, the coordinate of the particle
in the potential u(s) thus the kinetic energy-( s2) is negative under the
barrier. it has been shown that letting s run from s  , to s  0 under
the barrier is equivalent to summing up over all instantons in the dilute
gas approximation. but instantons are paths in conguration space. thus
time-evolution of the eld (i.e. let s run from  to 0) is equivalent to
the trajectory over the ensemble of paths in conguration space. (think of
it as phase space). the changing of sign of s2 from s < 0 to s2 > 0 would
correspond to an inection point in this trajectory. that is also the turning
point from under the barrier to outside. taking this statistical point of view
one would go from euclidean to lorentz region at the inection point. in
general s = s(t) is a complicated function of time, thus te  it does not
always give the analytical continuation from dep to real time, i.e.
is not
crucial for tunneling, but if one can reduce the problem to a few degrees of
freedom (s-in our case) going from negative kinetic energy of these degrees
from s2 < 0 to s > 0 is inevitable in the case
to positive kinetic i.e.
of tunneling, i.e.
its intrinsic to this process. the reason is because this
parameter is dened in terms of the hamiltonian and the eld is not an
eigenstate of the hamiltonian in the case of tunneling . outside the barrier
s2 > 0 and the time-evolution for 0 < s <  gives the in-out states.
in this approach one considers instantaneous tunneling in real time, i.e. at
s = 0 (in real time parameter), the eld hops from the false vacuum to the
other side of the barrier (true vacuum) and at s   settles in the true
vacuum (l out>-state). the solution at the turning point s = 0 which is the
endpoint of dep is analytically continued thus the phase shift from dep .
so, particle production comes from the phase shift and the l in-out> states
are obtained from the analytic continuation of the dep in lorentz region,
i.e. in terms of s-parameter. the in-out states are the evolution of dep
when s  , 0.
then one could study real tunneling through particle production meth-
ods. knowing particle production and the l out>-state one has all the infor-
mation about the phase shift/i.e. tunneling, and evoluting the lout>-state
back in time-s one can obtain the dep by analytically continuing at the
inection point (turning point where s2 goes through zero).

particle production calculated in our case, when the mass is time-dependent,

i.e. dynamic background of the bubble, exhibits a strong resonance eect
with the bubble for those modes that are comparable to the curvature scale

17

of the bubble (i.e.
for p  n3 or p  nr, n = 1, 2, 3 . . . 10 . . .). when
the modes have a high momentum they are exponentially suppressed by a
factor exp[2p]. this feature of exponential suppression by exp[2p]
or exp[4r] has been previsouly found by [8,9] when they considered m2-
term to be a step function or a constant in each region respectively. in these
last 2 limiting cases mp has a thermal behavior as previously discussed by
[8,9]. see gure 3.2, 3.3.

one interesting case, currently under investigation, is when the barrier
itself is time-dependent. from naive arguments we would expect a larger
range of modes to resonate with the bubble (as argued by butiker and lan-
duer). however we may nd a nontrivial answer, dierent from the above,
once that calculation is done.

the modes of the -eld, if one considers those as the environment, will
have an eect on the -tunneling eld (considered as the system). that can
be found through calculating the noise and dissipation kernels in the case
when the o(4) symmetry is broken i.e. when we have more than one degree
of freedom for , thus bringing correlation of the w kb branches under the
barrier. we hope to reveal these results within the next year.
