the kaluza-klein spectrum of n =2, d=4 supergravity compactied on ads2s2 is found
and shown to consist of two innite towers of su (1, 1|2) representations. in addition to pure
gauge modes living on the boundary of ads which are familiar from higher dimensional cases,
in two dimensions there are modes (e.g. massive gravitons) which enjoy no gauge symmetry yet
nevertheless have no on-shell degrees of freedom in the bulk. we discuss these two-dimensional
subtleties in detail.

1 introduction

following the conjecture of maldacena [1, 2, 3] relating supergravity (or string theory) on adsd
to a (d1)-dimensional conformal eld theory (see [4] for a review) there has been a revival of
interest in supergravity compactications on anti-de sitter spaces. the kaluza-klein spectrum of
these compactications should be identical to the spectrum of chiral primary operators in the dual
conformal eld theory. recent papers have considered supergravity compactications on ads3s3
[5, 6], ads3s2 [7, 8], and ads2s3 [9]. we complete the square by considering n =2, d=4
supergravity on ads2s2.
interest in ads2s2 stems from the fact that it is the near-horizon
geometry of the extreme reissner-nordstrom black hole in four dimensions [10], and because a
precise elucidation of the nature of the dual 0 + 1 dimensional conformal eld theory (i.e. quantum
mechanics) living on the boundary of ads2 is lacking. for relevant work in this direction, see
[11, 10, 12].

compactication of supergravity to two dimensions presents diculties not present in higher-
dimensional cases. one is that the equation of motion for the two-dimensional graviton h cannot
be diagonalized because it involves some scalar elds which cannot be eliminated. however, far from
being a problem, this is to be expected in two dimensionsconformal invariance in two dimensions
prevents the denition of the einstein frame. this presents no obstacle to determining the mass
spectrum, since although these scalar elds act as sources for the two-dimensional tensor eld h
they do not aect its mass.

under dimensional reduction on ads times spheres one obtains innite towers of kaluza-klein
modes with on-shell degrees of freedom in the bulk, and in addition one typically nds a small
number of pure gauge modes which live only on the boundary of ads. these include the doubleton
multiplet of su(2, 2|4) in the case of ads5 [13] and the singleton multiplet of osp(4|8) in the case
of ads4 [14]. these modes arise from elds which can be gauged away everywhere in the bulk using
residual gauge transformations (we discuss these in detail in section 3.1). in compactication to two
dimensions one encounters a third type of eld: those which have no on-shell degrees of freedom in
the bulk not because of any gauge invariance but simply because their equations of motion impose
suciently many constraints to eliminate the eld completely. in two dimensions, massive gravitons
and gravitini fall into this category. a massive graviton, for example, enjoys no gauge invariance
and has 1
2(d+1)(d2) degrees of freedom on-shell in d dimensions. by a careful analysis of the
equations of motion for these massive gravitons in ads2 we will show that they do not give rise to
independent degrees of freedom.

in section 2 we discuss the ads2s2 solution of n =2, d=4 pure supergravity.

in section 3
we determine the spectrum of bosonic kaluza-klein uctuations around the ads2s2 background.
section 3.1 contains a detailed discussion of the residual gauge transformations in ads2s2. the
results of section 3 are fairly simple but great care is taken to address in detail the subtleties
mentioned above. section 4 addresses the fermionic kaluza-klein uctuations. finally, in section 5
we arrange the kaluza-klein modes into representations of the supergroup su(1, 1|2).

2 the ads2s2 supergravity solution

2.1 lagrangian
the gravity multiplet of n =2, d=4 supergravity contains the spin-2 graviton gm n , a complex
spin- 3
2 gravitino m , and a spin-1 graviphoton am . our notational conventions are summarized in
appendix a. the lagrangian is [15]

l = g(cid:20)r

f 2

2

m m n pn p 

i
4

m (f m n  i5 f m n )n(cid:21) + l4,

(2.1)

where l4 contains terms quartic in m which will not be relevant for our analysis since we are only
interested in uctuations around a classical background with m = 0.1 the action is invariant
under n =2 supersymmetry transformations, whose action on the gravitino eld is

m = 2(cid:20)m +

i
8

fn p n p m +   (cid:21) ,

(2.2)

where  is a complex spinor parameter and the dots represent terms bilinear in m which we will
not need. we will make extensive use of the operator

dm  m +

i
8

fn p n p m .

(2.3)

2.2 freund-rubin ansatz

the bosonic equations of motion arising from (2.1) in a background with m = 0 are the familiar
einstein-maxwell equations

rm n  1

2 rgm n = 1

2(cid:0)fm p fn
m f m n = 0.

p  1

4 gm n f 2(cid:1) ,

(2.4a)

(2.4b)

it follows from the trace of einsteins equation that r = 0. we take the freund-rubin ansatz [16]

f = 0 = fm,

fmn = 2mn,

(2.5)

assuming a product space, the einstein equations then give

rm = 0,

r = g ,

rmn = gmn,

(2.6)

which is consistent with the ansatz, and gives the desired ads2s2 topology, with unit radii.

1in particular, we do not explore the consistency of a truncation to the massless sector of the two-dimensional

theory on ads2.

3

2.3 supersymmetry
the ads2s2 solution preserves the maximal amount of supersymmetry. the supersymmetry
variation of the bosonic elds involves only m , and consequently vanish automatically in the
ads2s2 background m = 0. the supersymmetry variation m is given by (2.2) and vanishes
in the ads2s2 background for killing spinors  satisfying

the killing spinors may be written down exactly [17, 18], but we will be content to note that the
integrability conditions

dm  =(cid:2)m  1

2 m(cid:3)  = 0.

(2.7)

(2.8a)

(2.8b)

0 = [d, d] =(cid:2) 1
0 = [dm, dn] =(cid:2) 1

4 gr + 1
4 gpqrpq  1

2(cid:3) ,
2(cid:3) mn

are consistent with (2.6), implying the existence of the maximal number of solutions for , namely
eight (four complex components).

3 bosonic kaluza-klein spectrum

in this section we calculate the spectrum of bosonic uctuations around the ads2  s2 back-
ground (2.5) and (2.6). we write the uctuations as

gm n = hm n ,

am = am

and expand the elds in spherical harmonics y(lm) on s2, which satisfy

(y  mm). the conventionally dened y(lm) also satisfy the useful identity

yy(lm)(y) = l(l + 1)y(lm)(y),

mny(1m) = gmny(1m).

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

we use parentheses to distinguish the so(3) quantum numbers lm from s2 indices. the kaluza-
klein modes will carry su(2) representation labels (lm) and in particular the bosonic modes will
fall into (2l + 1)-tuplets of so(3) with charge l. since the rank of so(3) is one, all higher tensor
harmonics can be expressed in terms of the scalars y(lm). in particular, the space of vector spherical
harmonics is spanned by2

my(lm),

mnny(lm),

l  1,

(3.4)

where we remark for later use that for l=1, k m
and c m
on equation (3.3). the space of symmetric traceless tensor spherical harmonics is spanned by

(m)=mnny(1m) are the 3 of killing vectors on s2
(m)=my(1m) are the 3 of conformal killing vectors on s2. the proof of this assertion relies

{mn}y(lm),

{mn}ppy(lm),

l  2.

(3.5)

2we have not normalized these basis vectors since we only use their orthogonality. however, the interested reader

will nd the normalization, and additional details, in [19].

before proceeding, it is necessary to consider carefully the process of xing the dieomorphism
and u(1) gauge invariance of the action to eliminate unphysical gauge degrees of freedom. we will
see that it is possible to x the de donder gauge

and the lorentz gauge

mh{mn} =0,

mhm = 0

mam = 0,

(3.6)

(3.7)

but we will nd that there are residual gauge transformations preserving (3.6) and (3.7), whose
behaviour will be important below.

3.1 gauge transformations and gauge xing

the transformations of hm n and am under a dieomorphism m (x, y) and gauge transformation
(x, y) are

hm n = m n + n m ,

am = m  + n fn m + m (n an ).

(3.8)

we consider rst just dieomorphisms, parametrized by m (x, y). to x the de donder gauge

we need m to satisfy

mh{mn} + (y + 1)n = 0,

mhm + y + mm = 0.

(3.9)

thus, we choose

n = (y + 1)1mh{mn},

 = 1

y (mhm + mm).

(3.10)

we remark that there is no problem inverting the required dierential operators on s2the expan-
sion of h{mn} in terms of symmetric traceless tensor spherical harmonics (3.5) begins at l = 2 while
the only zero modes of y + 1 are the l = 1 vector spherical harmonics (3.4), and similarly the
expansion of hm begins at l = 1 while the only zero mode of y is y(00).

to see if additional gauge-xing is possible, it is convenient to expand the dieomorphism pa-

rameter m (x, y) in spherical harmonics:

(x, y) = (lm)



(x)y(lm)(y),

m(x, y) =  (lm)(x)my(lm)(y) + (lm)(x)mnny(lm)(y),

(3.11)

where on the right-hand side the repeated (lm) index implies the summation

a(lm)y(lm) 



l

xl=0

xm=l

a(lm)y(lm).

maintaining the gauge (3.6) requires

m(m + m) = 0

and

m(mn + nm  gmnpp) = (y + 1)n = 0.

5

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

the latter implies that only (1m)(x) and  (1m)(x) are non-zero. plugging this into the former, we
nd that (00)

is arbitrary while (1m)



therefore, we nd that the de donder gauge (3.6) is maintained by residual gauge transforma-

 =  (1m).

n(x, y) =

xm=1(cid:2) (1m)(x)ny(1m)(y) + (1m)(x)nppy(1m)(y)(cid:3) .

(3.15a)

(3.15b)

the residual gauge parameters constitute a 1 and two 3s of so(3). the 1 correspondes to ordinary
two-dimensional dieomorphisms (00)
in ads2, and the two 3s correspond to the three yang-mills
symmetries (1m) and three conformal dieomorphisms  (1m). we will consider the residual gauge
transformations further in section 3.3.



having explored dieomorphisms to our satisfaction, we now need to nd (x, y) so that the

lorentz gauge (3.7) is achieved. this is obviously accomplished via

(x, y) = 1

y mam.

(3.16)

again there is no problem inverting the laplacian. the residual gauge transformations are those
for which y = 0, i.e., (x, y) = (x). these provide the usual two dimensional gauge invariance,
as discussed further in section 3.3.

in this subsection we veried that it is possible to x the de donder (3.6) and lorentz (3.7)
gauges, and we have found that there are a nite set of residual gauge transformations preserv-
ing these gauge choices. these residual gauge transformations dier from the gauge transforma-
tions (3.10) and (3.16) used to x de donder and lorentz gauges in an essential way. finding
the latter gauge transformations involved inverting dierential operators on s2, which we showed
was always possible to do, whereas xing the residual gauge degrees of freedom involves inverting
dierential operators on ads2, a process which is not completely well-dened because of ambiguity
in the choice of 1
related to a choice of boundary conditions at the edge of ads2. the residual
x
gauge transformations may be used to eliminate the bulk degrees of freedom associated with a given
eld, but they do not eliminate boundary degrees of freedom associated with that mode. that is,
the elds can be gauged away everywhere except on the boundary of ads2. the modes killed by
imposing the de donder and lorentz gauges, on the other hand, have no residual degrees of freedom
on the boundary and can be ignored completely.

3.2 spherical harmonic expansion

we expand the bosonic elds as

 (x)y(lm)(y),

h(x, y) = h (lm)
hm(x, y) = b(lm)
h{mn}(x, y) = (lm)(x){mn}y(lm)(y) + (lm)(x){mn}ppy(lm),
hm

(x)mnny(lm)(y) + b(lm)

(x)my(lm)(y),

m(x, y) = (lm)(x)y(lm)(y),





(3.17a)

(3.17b)

(3.17c)

(3.17d)

6

a(x, y) = b(lm)
am(x, y) = b(lm)(x)mnny(lm)(y) + b(lm)(x)my(lm)(y).

(x)y(lm)(y),



(3.17e)

(3.17f)

imposing the de donder (3.6) and lorentz (3.7) gauges to x local dieomorphism and u(1) gauge
invariance eliminates b, , , and b, leaving

 (x)y(lm)(y),

(x)mnny(lm)(y),

h(x, y) = h (lm)
hm(x, y) = b(lm)


h{mn}(x, y) = 0,
hm

m(x, y) = (lm)(x)y(lm)(y),
a(x, y) = b(lm)
(x)y(lm)(y),
am(x, y) = b(lm)(x)mnny(lm)(y).



we note for later use that we can set

b(00) = 0,

b(00)

 = 0

since the corresponding vector spherical harmonic vanishes at l=0.

3.3 residual gauge transformations

(3.18a)

(3.18b)

(3.18c)

(3.18d)

(3.18e)

(3.18f)

(3.19)

recalling equation (3.15), we now consider separately the action of each of these residual gauge
transformations.

under an ordinary dieomorphism (00)

 we have

h =

1
4

((00)

 + (00)



),

(3.20)

which is indeed the action of a usual two-dimensional dieomorphism. in particular, upon compar-
ison with the expansion of h in (3.17), we nd

h (00)

 = (00)

 +  (00)



.

(3.21)

thus (00)



provides gauge invariance for h (00)

 , which we will nd to be the massless ads2 graviton.

the action of (1m) is

hn =

1

xm=1

(1m)nppy(1m),

which upon comparison with the expansion of hn in (3.17) gives

b(1m)

 = (1m).

(3.22)

(3.23)

thus (1m) provides gauge invariance for the so(3) triplet of vectors b(1m)
be massless.



, which we will nd to

the action of  (1m) on hm n takes the form

hn

 (1m)y(1m),

xm=1
n = 4
xm=1
 (1m)y(1m),

1

h = 2

(3.24a)

(3.24b)

which amounts to

(1m) = 4 (1m),

h (1m)

 = 2  (1m).

(3.25)

we can use these conformal dieomorphisms to set some linear combination of h (1m)
to zero.

 and (1m)

also, the residual gauge transformation (x), left undened by equation (3.10), gives

for the vector eld b(00)



, which we will also nd to be massless.

b(00)

 = (x)

(3.26)

(3.28e)

each term in brackets must vanish separately (for each (lm)) due to the orthogonality of the various
spherical harmonics. however, not all of the equations are in eect for l=0 and l=1. for example,
in (3.28c), {mn}y(lm) vanishes for l<2 so we only get the condition h (lm)
=0 for l2. for this
reason it is worthwhile to consider the l=0 and l=1 levels separately from l2. first, however, we
present a brief but useful diversion regarding massive gravitons.

3.5 a note on massive gravitons in ads2

consider a symmetric traceless tensor k in two dimensions which is also transverse, i.e.

in two dimensions, these assumptions are sucient to prove that

k = 0.

(  r)k = 0,

(3.29)

(3.30)

where r is the two-dimensional ricci scalar, with r = 2 for ads2. now suppose that k is to
satisfy the equation of motion for a graviton of mass m2 in ads [20]
( + 2  m2)k  2(k) = 0.

(3.31)

the second term vanishes by virtue of (3.29), and the remaining equation is consistent with (3.30)
only if m2 = 0. we conclude that a symmetric traceless tensor eld k in ads2 which satises (3.29)
can only satisfy (3.31) if m2 = 0. if m2 6= 0, the only solution is k = 0. we will use this analysis
in the following sections to eliminate the massive graviton from the kaluza-klein spectrum.

3.6 the l = 0 level
recalling (3.19), we only have to worry about the elds h (00)
equations, coming from the brackets multiplying y(00) in (3.28a), (3.28c), and (3.28d):

 , (00), and b(00)



. there are only three

2(h (00)

 + (00))

 + (h (00)

   b(00)

.



9

  (00)),

(3.32a)

(3.32b)

(3.32c)

the second equation gives a scalar with mass m2 = 2, while the third equation may be written as

f = 0,

f = b(00)

   b(00)



,

(3.33)

(the shift of the laplacian by 1 comes from the curvature of s2) so b(00)
is a massless vector, which
has the appropriate gauge invariance as a result of (3.26). in two dimensions a massless vector has
no propagating degrees of freedom on shell, but there are boundary degrees of freedom which we
will tabulate below.

it remains to analyze the third equation in (3.32). there is no constraint on the trace of h (00)

so we will consider the trace part and the traceless part separately. first consider turning on a
uctuation with (00) = 0 and h (00)

 = hg. the equation of motion for such a mode is



(  2)h = 0,

(3.34)

which seems to give a scalar eld h with mass m2 = 2. however, one can use the residual dieo-
morphism invariance (3.21) to gauge h to zero everywhere except on the boundary. therefore h is
not a propagating degree of freedom in the bulk but is present on the boundary.

now consider the traceless part of h (00)

 . the equation of motion for a uctuation h (00)

 with

h (00)

 = 0 is then

( + 2)h (00)

  2(h (00)

) = (00)  2g(00).

(3.35)

as discussed in the introduction, the scalar eld (00) cannot be eliminated from this equation.
nevertheless, the source terms on the right-hand side of (3.35) do not aect the mass of h (00)
 .
for (00) = 0, (3.35) is precisely the equation of motion for a massless graviton (3.31), and indeed
h (00)
 has the correct ads2 dieomorphism invariance to be the massless graviton as a consequence
of (3.21). because of this gauge invariance, h (00)
can be eliminated in the bulk, and the massless

graviton has only a boundary degree of freedom.

to summarize: at the l = 0 level we nd one bulk degree of freedom, a scalar with m2 = 2, and

three pure gauge modes: a scalar with m2 = 2, a massless vector, and a massless graviton.

3.7 the l = 1 level

at the l = 1 level there are seven equations, coming from all of the brackets in (3.28a)(3.28e)
except for the rst two in (3.28c). from (3.28c) and (3.28e) we nd

0 = 1

2 h (1m)
0 = h (1m)

  1
4(  4)(1m)  2b(1m),
  (1m)  (  2)b(1m),

which combine to yield

(  6)((1m)  2b(1m)) = 0,

(3.36a)

(3.36b)

(3.37)

so that (1m)  2b(1m) is a scalar with m2 = 6. since we can use the residual conformal dieomor-
phisms (3.25) to gauge-x (1m) to zero, there is no other scalar at this level. since the conformal
dieomorphisms eliminate only bulk degrees of freedom, there is an extra boundary degree of free-
dom associated to an l = 1 scalar. however, because the eld equation for this excitation is

10

missing, we cannot determine its mass (although in section 5 we will use group theory to argue
that it must have m2 = 0). the missing equation of motion and the use of the residual conformal
dieomorphisms is discussed by [13] in the context of ads5  s5, where the boundary degrees of
freedom in that case turn out to be the six scalars of the su(2, 2|4) doubleton.
 is not an indepedent degree of freedom since it can be
algebraically eliminated. furthermore, one also nds from (3.28a) and (3.28b)

the equations (3.36) show that h (1m)

h (1m)

  2(h (1m)

) = (h (1m)
 + 1
0 =  1

2(h (1m)

 + (1m)) + 2g(h (1m)
2 (1m)) + 1

2h (1m)

 + b(1m).

  (1m) + 2b(1m)),

(3.38a)

(3.38b)

the second of these equations gives two rst order constraints on h (1m)
, enabling one to solve for
the remaining two components. thus h (1m)
has no on-shell degrees of freedom in the bulk, as we
expect for gravitons in two dimensions. to be more precise, consider a traceless uctuation of h (1m)
.
the linear dierential equations (3.38b) will have a specic solution involving b(1m) and (1m), as
well as a homogeneous solution h (1m)







{} satisfying

 h (1m)

{} = 0.

(3.39)

{} must vanish, implying that
{} has no independent degrees of freedom but is completely determined in terms of b(1m) and

but the analysis of section 3.5 (with m2=l(l+1)=2) shows that h (1m)
h (1m)
(1m) through the specic solution to (3.38b).

finally, from (3.28b), (3.28d), and (3.28e) we have the three equations

2(  3)b(1m)

  1

0 = 1
0 = 4b(1m)

2 b(1m)

  b(1m)
   b(1m)





 + (  1)b(1m)
0 = 2b(1m)
we can use the gauge invariance (3.23) of b(1m)
b(1m)

to set b(1m)
 = 0 as well. the remaining two equations decouple to give

  b(1m)







.

= 0, which we see then sets

,

,

(3.40a)

(3.40b)

(3.40c)

(  5)(b(1m)

 + b(1m)



) = 0,

( + 1)(2b(1m)

  b(1m)



) = 0,

(3.41)

which are the equations of motion for vectors of mass m2 = 6 and m2 = 0, respectively. the massless
vector has the proper gauge invariance as a result of (3.23).

we have exhausted the content of all seven equations. to summarize, at the l = 1 level we nd
two bulk degrees of freedom, one scalar and one vector each with m2 = 6, and boundary degrees
of freedom corresponding to a scalar whose mass we could not determine and one massless vector.
each of these modes is a 3 of so(3).

3.8 l  2
for l  2 we immediately observe from (3.28c) that h (lm)
that b(lm)

 = 0. the two equations involving only the vectors b(lm)

 = 0 = b(lm)




and b(lm)

, and hence, from (3.28e),
come from (3.28b)



11

and (3.28d) and now read

( + 1) b(lm)


b(lm)

2l(l + 1)

2

l(l + 1)(cid:19) b(lm)
 !


b(lm)

(3.42)

diagonalizing this mass matrix leads to two innite towers of massive vector elds with on-shell
masses m2 =  + 1 (where the shift comes from a curvature term in the maxwell equations) given
by

m2 =(cid:26) l(l  1)

(l + 1)(l + 2)

,

l  2.

(3.43)

the two equations involving only the scalars (lm) and b(lm) coming from (3.28c) and (3.28e) are

(cid:18)(lm)

b(lm)(cid:19) =(cid:18)l(l + 1) + 2 4l(l + 1)

l(l + 1) (cid:19)(cid:18)(lm)
b(lm)(cid:19) ,

1

and hence we have two towers of massive scalars with masses (m2 = )

m2 =(cid:26) l(l  1)

(l + 1)(l + 2)

,

l  2.

we have exhausted the content of all but two equations. from (3.28a) and (3.28b) we have

(  (l + 2)(l  1))h (lm)

) = (lm) + 2g((lm) + l(l + 1)b(lm)),

  2(h (lm)

 + b(lm) = 0.

(3.44)

(3.45)

(3.46a)

(3.46b)

we now mimick the analysis following (3.38a) and (3.38b) to conclude that h (lm)
degrees of freedom.



has no on-shell

3.9 summary

we separate the bosonic spectrum into the physical (propagating) degrees of freedom in the bulk
and those which live only on the boundary. the bulk modes are

scalar
scalar m2 = (l + 1)(l + 2)
vector
vector m2 = (l + 1)(l + 2)

m2 = l(l  1)
m2 = l(l  1)

l  2
l  0
l  2
l  1

(3.47)

where each eld represents one on-shell bosonic degree of freedom. the modes which live only on
the boundary are

m2 = ?
m2 = 2

scalar

vector m2 = l(l  1) = 0

(3.48)

12

the rst scalar has no associated eld equation so it is impossible to determine its mass. (in section 5
we will use group theory to argue that the mass of this scalar is m2 = 0.) all of the entries in this
table represent pure gauge modes, i.e.
the corresponding eld can be gauged away everywhere
except on the boundary of ads2 using the residual gauge invariances disussed in section 3.1.

the tables (3.47) and (3.48) are not very useful. for one thing, the distinction between scalars
and vectors makes no sense in two dimensions, where each one has one on-shell degree or freedom.
secondly, the m2 column doesnt really make sense in ads2 on-shell, m2 is the quadratic casimir
of the poincare group, which is the isometry group of at space but not of ads2. instead of m2,
we should label our bosonic modes by their quantum numbers (h, q) under the sl(2, r)  su(2)
isometry group of ads2s2.
for bosonic elds in ads2, the conformal weight h is related to the mass (as conventially
dened) by the well-known formula [4]

h = 1

2(1  1 + 4m2),

(3.49)

where one takes the larger root. the su(2) charge q is simply the l of the associated spherical
harmonic y(lm). using these rules we nd that the sl(2, r)  su(2) quantum numbers of the bulk
modes are

and those of the boundary modes are

(2, 0),

2(k, k)k2,

2(k + 1, k  1)k2,

(?, 1),

(2, 0),

(1, 1),

2(1, 0).

in section 5 we argue that the rst mode must be (1, 1).

4 fermionic kaluza-klein spectrum

in this section we calculate the spectrum of fermionic uctuations around the ads2s2 background
m =0. the lagrangian (2.1) gives the following equation of motion for m in a background with
m =0,

m n pn p + i

2 (f m n  i5 f m n )n = 0.

in the ads2s2 background given by (2.5) and (2.6) this equation takes the simple form

m n p dn p = 0,

(4.1)

(4.2)

with dn given by (2.7). we decompose the four-dimensional gravitino m (x, y) into (x, y) =
(x)(y) and m(x, y) = (x)m(y), where (x) and (x) are spacetime gravitini and spinors
and (y) and m(y) are internal (s2) spinors and vector-spinors. the equation of motion (4.2)
couples the spacetime gravitini and spinor degrees of freedom, but they can be decoupled by imposing
the condition

m m = 0

13

(4.3)

to gauge-x local supersymmetry. using the equation of motion (4.2), one nds that the condi-
tion (4.3) also implies that

using the conditions (4.3) and (4.4), the decoupled equations of motion for  and  read

dm m = m m = 0.

(   )   =   (mm),
()  m =   (nnm  mnn).

4.1 spinor harmonics on s2

(4.4)

(4.5a)
(4.5b)

it will be convenient to expand the fermionic elds in terms of eigenspinors of the dirac operator
mm on s2. we denote the eigenspinors of this operator by (lm)(y), where l is now a half-
integer, l = 1

2 , . . . , and m ranges as as usual from l to +l in unit steps. these spinors satisfy

2 , 3

and hence

mm(lm)(y) = (l + 1

2)(lm)(y),

note that ( 1

2 ,m) are the 2 of killing spinors on s2 satisfying

y(lm)(y) =(cid:2)l(l + 1) + 1

4(cid:3) (lm)(y).

and indeed the (lm)s may be constructed from y(lm) and ( 1

2 ,m) [13].

2 ,m) = 0,

dm( 1

2 ,m) =(cid:2)m  1

2 m(cid:3) ( 1

4.2 spinors

the spectrum of spacetime spinors (x) is found by diagonalizing the mass operator

on s2. a complete basis of vector-spinors m on s2 is provided by

m (1/2)

mn  gmnpp  mn

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

m(lm),

m(lm),

m(lm),

m(lm).

(4.10)

however, this basis includes modes of the form m = dm (for some ), which are spurious since
they can be gauged away using the gauge symmetry (2.2). using the denitions of dm and m (1/2)
mn ,
one can show that

if one now decomposes m into [21]

dmm (1/2)

mn n = nndmm.

m = m + dm,

dmm = 0,

(4.11)

(4.12)

14

then (4.11) imples that this decomposition is maintained by the spin- 1
2 mass operator. therefore, the
eigenspace of this operator naturally decomposes into the space of spurious states with dmm 6= 0
and the space of physical states which obey

dmm = 0.

(4.13)

viewing dm as an operator from the four-dimensional space of vector-spinors spanned by (4.10)
(at xed l and m) to the two-dimensional space of spinors spanned by (lm) and (lm), it is clear
that dm has (at least) a two-dimensional kernel. one can check that the kernel is exactly two-
dimensional and that a basis of the physical states satisfying dmm = 0 is provided by the two
vector-spinors

am
(lm) =  [m  lm] (lm),
(lm) = [m + (l + 1)m] (lm),
bm

l  3
2 ,
l  1
2 ,
where the restriction on l for am arises from noting that am
2 ,m) = dm( 1

2)bm(lm)(cid:19) .

(4.15)

let us summarize sl(2, r)  su(2) content of these spinors. for each eigenvector-spinor m of
mn with eigenvalue  there will be an ads2 spinor  satisfying (4.5b)

m (1/2)

 = .

(4.16)

the mass of  is therefore just m = . the conformal weight h of a spinor eld  is given by
h = |m| + 1
2.[4] finally recall that the gravitino m is complex, so the spinor  is allowed to be
complex as well, and therefore represents 2 fermionic degrees of freedom on-shell. we therefore nd
from (4.15) the following towers of spinors:

2h(l + 1, l)l 3

2  (l + 1, l)l 1

2i = 2( 3

2 , 1

2 )  4(k + 1

2 , k  1

2)k2.

(4.17)

finally we need to discuss the presence of fermionic boundary degrees of freedom. although we
have not carefully analysed the residual gauge transformations for the fermions, we can identify the
aected states by looking for vanishing equations of motion. vanishing equations of motion signal the
presence of states which are subject to a residual gauge symmetry [22]. we saw this for the bosons at
the l=1 level with regard to the residual bosonic gauge transformations of section 3.3. the vanishing
of am
(lm) in (4.15) implies through (4.5) that the equation of motion for the associated spacetime
spinor  vanishes. we identify this  as a boundary degree of freedom with sl(2, r)  su(2)
content

2( 3

2 , 1

2 ),

(4.18)

(again,  counts twice because it is complex). in section (5) we will see that (4.18) falls into an
su(1, 1|2) multiplet with the l=1 scalars whose equation of motion vanishes.

15

4.3 gravitini

in two dimensions, gravitini (massless or massive) have no on-shell degrees of freedom. the story
is similar to that of the gravitonin the massless case, the gauge symmetry (i.e. supersymmetry)
eliminates the states, while in the massive case the equation of motion implies additional constraints
which eliminate the states.

the general theory of kaluza-klein compactication [23] shows that massless gravitini are in
one-to-one correspondence with killing spinors on the internal manifold, which in this case form a
2 of su(2).

taking  = ( 1

2 ,m) in (4.5) gives

with  = 1. the relation between the mass and conformal weight for a spin- 3

2 eld is [4]

      = 0

(4.19)

1
2

.

h = |m| +
however, the denition of the mass m for a spin- 3
2 to use in this equation has some convention-
dependence. a careful analysis [24] 3 shows that the eld equation (4.19) implies that the m in (4.20)
should be m =   1. indeed, with this denition of mass, gauge symmetry (i.e., supersymmetry)
is restored at m = 0. to see this, consider a supersymmetry variation  =   where  is a
killing spinor on ads2. using   = 1
2  , one easily checks that (4.19) is invariant only when
m =   1 = 0.
su(2) content

the massless gravitino, which has only boundary degrees of freedom, therefore has sl(2, r) 

(4.20)

( 1
2 , 1

2 ).

(4.21)

5 su (1, 1|2) composition of the spectrum
in this section we show how the kaluza-klein modes fall into representations of su(1, 1|2), whose
bosonic part is the product of the su(1, 1) = sl(2, r) isometry of ads2 and the su(2) isometry
of s2.

the unitary irreducible representations of su(1, 1|2) are well known [27] (see [6, 4] for a modern
review and applications). the short multiplets are labelled by a half-integer k (k > 0) and have the
sl(2, r)  su(2) content [4]

k  (k, k)  2(k + 1

2 , k  1

2)  (k + 1, k  1).

(5.1)

the multiplet includes four states (which are sl(2, r) primaries), except in the case k = 1
the last state is missing,

2 where

1

2 = ( 1

2 , 1

2 )  2(1, 0).

(5.2)

3massless rarita-schwinger elds were previously considered, in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, in

ref. [25, 26].

16

there are no singleton representations [6].

we now assemble the su(1, 1|2) multiplets from (3.50), (3.51), (4.18) and (4.17), and (4.21).
from the massless graviton, l = 0 vector and gravitino we form a single 1
2 of su(1, 1|2). these elds
are just the restriction to the lowest s2 harmonic of the original elds (gm n , m , am ). they are
pure gauge modes in two dimensions. from the innite towers of scalars, vectors, and spinors we
have two towers 2(k)k2 of modes with physical degrees of freedom in the bulk of ads2. finally we
see that the scalar mode with undetermined h in (3.51) must be (1, 1) in order to t the remaining
modes into su(1, 1|2) representations. assembling the remaining modes gives 2(1). one of these
1s contains elds whose equations of motion were found to vanish, signaling the presence of residual
gauge symmetries which eliminate the bulk degrees of freedom of these modes. the other 1 contains
a bulk scalar, a complex bulk spinor, and a triplet of massless vector elds transforming in the 3 of
su(2). because we only linearized the equations, we could not see the nonabelian gauge symmetry
presumably possessed by these vectors.

6 conclusion and discussion

we have determined the kaluza-klein spectrum of n =2, d=4 supergravity on ads2s2. the
su(1, 1|2) composition of the spectrum is 1
2  2(k)zk1. furthermore we have categorized the
modes according to whether they have on-shell degrees of freedom in the bulk of ads2 or whether,
because of residual gauge transformations, they may be gauged away everywhere in the bulk of
ads2 and hence only represent boundary degrees of freedom.

in two dimensions one also encounters modes without any gauge symmetry yet which have no
on-shell degrees of freedom in the bulk, such as gravitons and gravitini. we showed explicitly
that the equations of motion for the massive gravitons implied that they have no independent
degrees of freedom. our analysis for the gravitini was less careful, but the result must follow by
supersymmetry.
it is conceivable that one could resurrect these modes (or any other modes one
fancies) on the boundary by adding suitable boundary terms to the supergravity action. however
they are not required, and indeed our su(1, 1|2) analysis has not found any modes lacking.
as this work was near completion we learned of similar investigations by j. lee and s. lee [29].

a conventions

we use the mostly positive metric signature, m n = diag(1, +1, +1, +1). upper case latin indices
m, n, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3 run over ads2s2, lower case latin indices m, n = 2, 3 are internal indices and
run over s2, and greek indices ,  = 0, 1 denote ads2 spacetime indices. we use x for coordinates
on ads2 and ym for coordinates on s2. the levi-civita symbol  is a true tensor, with 0123 = g,
and f m n = 1
2 m n p qfp q. curly braces around a pair of indices indicate symmetrization with the
trace removed, i.e.

h{mn} =

1
2

(hmn + hnm  gmnhp

p).

(a.1)

let  and m respectively satisfy the algebras {, } = 2g and {m, n} = 2gmn. multiple
indices denote antisymmetrization with unit weight, e.g. mn = 1
2(mn  nm). the chirality
operator on s2 is given by  =  i
2 mnmn. a representation of the four-dimensional dirac algebra
{m , n} = 2gm n is then furnished by  =  and m = 12m. in the text we will frequently
omit the tensor product symbol and write simply  =  and m = m. the four-dimensional
chirality operator is 5 =  i

2    (omitting the tensor product symbol).
