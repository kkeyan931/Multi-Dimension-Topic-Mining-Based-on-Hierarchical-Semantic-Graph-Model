abstract

we summarize recent results on the construction of lax pairs with spectral parameter
for the twisted and untwisted elliptic calogero-moser systems associated with arbitrary
simple lie algebras, their scaling limits to toda systems, and their role in seiberg-witten
theory. we extend part of this work by presenting a new parametrization for the spectral
curves for elliptic spin calogero-moser systems associated with sl(n ).

i. introduction

calogero-moser systems are hamiltonian systems with an amazingly rich structure.
recently, another remarkable property of these systems has been brought to light, namely
their intimate connection with exact solutions of supersymmetric gauge theories.

the n = 2 supersymmetric su (n ) gauge theory with a hypermultiplet in the ad-
joint representation was the rst gauge theory to be linked with elliptic calogero-moser
systems. in their 1995 work, based on several consistency checks, donagi and witten [1]
had proposed that the seiberg-witten spectral curves for the low-energy exact solution of
this theory were given by the spectral curves of a su (n ) hitchin system. subsequently,
martinec [2] and krichever in unpublished work recognized the su (n ) hitchin spectral
curves as identical to the spectral curves for elliptic su (n ) calogero-moser systems. that
the su (n ) elliptic calogero-moser curves do provide the seiberg-witten solution of the
su (n ) gauge theory with matter in the adjoint representation was established by the
authors in [3]. in particular, it was shown in [3] that the resulting prepotential has the
correct logarithmic singularities predicted by eld theoretic perturbative calculations, and
that it satises a renormalization group equation which determines explicitly instanton
contributions to any order.

the major problem in seiberg-witten theory is to determine the spectral curves,
and hence the integrable models, corresponding to an arbitrary asymptotically free or
conformally invariant n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge algebra g, and
matter hypermultiplets in a representation r of g. for reviews, see e.g. [4][5,6,7]. it has
been known now for a long time, thanks to the work of olshanetsky and perelomov [8][9],
that calogero-moser systems can be dened for any simple lie algebra*. olshanetsky
and perelomov also showed that the calogero-moser systems for classical lie algebras
were integrable, although the existence of a spectral curve (or lax pair with spectral
parameter) as well as the case of exceptional lie algebras remained open. thus several
immediate questions were:

 does the elliptic calogero-moser system for general lie algebra g admit a lax pair

with spectral parameter?

 does it correspond to the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge algebra

g and a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation?

 can this correspondence be veried in the limiting cases when the mass m of the
hypermultiplet tends to 0 and the gauge theory acquires an n = 4 supersymmetry and

* other models associated to lie algebras include the toda systems, of which more will
be said below, and the ruijsenaars-schneider systems, whose role in gauge theories is still
obscure.

2

becomes exact, and in the limit m  , when the hypermultiplet decouples and the
theory reduces to pure n = 2 yang-mills?

the answers to these questions turn out to be the following [10,11,12].

 the elliptic calogero-moser systems dened by an arbitrary simple lie algebra g
do admit lax pairs with spectral parameters. (in the case of e8, we need to assume the
existence of a cocycle)[10].

 the correspondence between elliptic g calogero-moser systems and n = 2 super-
symmetric g gauge theories with matter in the adjoint representation is only correct when
the lie algebra g is simply-laced. when g not simply-laced, we require new integrable
models, namely the twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems introduced in [10,12].

 the new twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems also admit a lax pair with spectral

parameter, except possibly in the case g = g2 [10].

 in the scaling limit m = m q 1

2   , m xed, the twisted (respectively untwisted)
elliptic g calogero-moser systems tend to the toda system for (g(1)) (respectively g(1))
for  = 1
g are the coxeter and the dual coxeter

numbers of g [11].

(respectively  = 1

). here hg and h

the main purpose of this paper is to review some of these developments. although
the case of the adjoint representation for arbitrary gauge algebras has now been solved, the
correspondence between gauge theories and integrable models is still far from complete.
in particular, one can wonder about the eventual role, if any, of other generalizations of
elliptic calogero-moser systems such as the ruijsenaars-schneider systems [13,14] or the
spin calogero-moser systems [15]. such questions require a better understanding of the
spectral curves of these systems, and particularly of their parametrizations. thus we have
taken this opportunity to describe also a new parametrization for the spectral curves of spin
calogero-moser systems. this new parametrization is suggestive of the order parameters
for the su (n ) gauge theory, and may be valuable in future developments.

ii. twisted and untwisted calogero-moser systems

the su (n ) elliptic calogero-moser system

the basic system in this paper is the elliptic calogero-moser system dened by the

hamiltonian

h(x, p) =

xi=1

p2
i

m2xi6=j

(xi  xj)

(2.1)

here m is a mass parameter, and (z) is the weierstrass -function, dened on a torus
c/(21z + 22z). as usual, we denote by  = 2/1 the moduli of the torus, and set

q = e2i . the well-known trigonometric and rational limits with respective potentials

(xi  xj)2

arise in the limits 1 = i, 2   and 1, 2  . all these systems have been shown
to be completely integrable in the sense of liouville, i.e. they all admit a complete set of
integrals of motion which are in involution [16,17].

our considerations require however a notion of integrability which is in some sense
more stringent, namely a lax pair l(z), m (z) with spectral parameter z. such a lax pair
was obtained by krichever [18] in 1980. he showed that the hamiltonian system (2.1)
is equivalent to the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m (z)], with l(z) and m (z) given by the
following n  n matrices

lij(z) =piij  m(1  ij)(xi  xj, z)

mij(z) =mijxk6=i

the function (x, z) is dened by

(xi  xk)  m(1  ij)(xi  xj, z).

(2.2)

(x, z) =

(z  x)
(z)(x)

ex(z),

(2.3)

where (z), (z) are the usual weierstrass  and  functions on the torus c/(21z+22z).
the function (x, z) satises the key functional equation

(x, z)(y, z)  (y, z)(x, z) = ((x)  (y))(x + y, z).

(2.4)

it is well-known that functional equations of this form are required for the hamilton
equations of motion to be equivalent to the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m (z)] with a
lax pair of the form (2.2). often, solutions had been obtained under additional parity
assumptions in x (and y), which prevent the existence of a spectral parameter. the solution
(x, z) with spectral parameter z is obtained by dropping such parity assumptions for
general z. it is a relatively recent result of braden and buchstaber [19] that, conversely,
the functional equation (2.4) essentially determines (x, z).

calogero-moser systems dened by lie algebras

as olshanetsky and perelomov [8,9] realized very early on, the hamiltonian system
(2.1) is only one example of a whole series of hamiltonian systems associated with each

4

simple lie algebra. more precisely, given any simple lie algebra g, olshanetsky and
perelomov [8] introduced the system with hamiltonian

h(x, p) =

1
2

r

xi=1

p2
i 

1

2 xr(g)

m2

||(  x),

(2.5)

where r is the rank of g, and r(g) denotes the set of roots of g. the m|| are mass
parameters. to preserve the invariance of the hamiltonian (2.5) under the weyl group,
the parameters m|| depend only on the length of || of the root , and not on the root 
itself. in the case of an1 = su (n ), it is common practice to use n pairs of dynamical
variables (xi, pi), since the roots of an1 lie conveniently on a hyperplane in cn . the
dynamics of the system are unaected if we shift all xi by a constant, and the number of
degrees of freedom is eectively n 1 = r. now the roots of su (n ) are given by  = eiej ,
1  i, j  n , i 6= j. thus we recognize the original elliptic calogero-moser system as the
special case of (2.5) corresponding to an1. as in the original case, the elliptic systems
(2.5) admit rational and trigonometric limits. olshanetsky and perelomov succeeded in
constructing a lax pair for all these systems in the case of classical lie algebras, albeit
without spectral parameter.

twisted calogero-moser systems dened by lie algebras

it turns out that the hamiltonian systems (2.5) are not the only natural extensions
of the basic elliptic calogero-moser system. a subtlety arises for simple lie algebras g
which are not simply-laced, i.e., algebras which admit roots of uneven length. this is the
case for the algebras bn, cn, g2, and f4 in cartans classication. for these algebras, the
following twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems were introduced by the authors in [10,11]

h twisted

g

=

1
2

r

xi=1

p2
i 

1

2 xr(g)

m2

||()(  x).

(2.6)

here the function () depends only on the length of the root . if g is simply-laced, we
set () = 1 identically. otherwise, for g non simply-laced, we set () = 1 when  is a
long root, () = 2 when  is a short root and g is one of the algebras bn, cn, or f4, and
() = 3 when  is a short root and g = g2. the twisted weierstrass function  (z) is
dened by

 (z) =

(z + 2a




),

(2.7)

where a is any of the half-periods 1, 2, or 1 + 2. thus the twisted and untwisted
calogero-moser systems coincide for g simply laced. the original motivation for twisted
calogero-moser systems was based on their scaling limits (which will be discussed in the

1

x=0

5

next section) [10,11]. another motivation based on the symmetries of dynkin diagrams
was proposed subsequently by bordner, sasaki, and takasaki [20].

iii. scaling limits of calogero-moser systems

results of inozemtsev for an

for the standard elliptic calogero-moser systems corresponding to an1, inozemtsev

[21,22] has shown in the 1980s that in the scaling limit

m = m q 1

q  0

xi = xi  22

, 1  i  n

(3.1)

(3.2)

where m is kept xed, the elliptic an1 calogero-moser hamiltonian tends to the following
hamiltonian

exi+1xi + ex1xn(cid:1)

(3.3)

the roots ei  ei+1, 1  i  n  1, and en  e1 can be recognized as the simple roots of
the ane algebra a(1)
n1. (for basic facts on ane algebras, we refer to [23]). thus (3.3)
can be recognized as the hamiltonian of the toda system dened by a(1)

n1.

scaling limits based on the coxeter number

the key feature of the above scaling limit is the collapse of the sum over the entire
root lattice of an1 in the calogero-moser hamiltonian to the sum over only simple roots
in the toda hamiltonian for the kac-moody algebra a(1)
n1. our task is to extend this
mechanism to general lie algebras. for this, we consider the following generalization of
the preceding scaling limit

2 ,

m = m q 1
x = x  22,

(3.4)

(3.5)

here x = (xi), x = (xi) and  are r-dimensional vectors. the vector x is the dynamical
variable of the calogero-moser system. the parameters  and  depend on the algebra
g and are yet to be chosen. as for m and x, they have the same interpretation as
earlier, namely as respectively the mass parameter and the dynamical variables of the
limiting system. setting 1 = i, the contribution of each root  to the calogero-moser
potential can be expressed as

m2(  x) =

1
2

m 2



xn=

e22

ch(  x  2n2)  1

(3.6)

it suces to consider positive roots . we shall also assume that 0       1. the
contributions of the n = 0 and n = 1 summands in (3.6) are proportional to e22( )
and e22(1+ ) respectively. thus the existence of a nite scaling limit requires that

       1  .

(3.7)

let i, 1  i  r be a basis of simple roots for g. if we want all simple roots i to survive
in the limit, we must require that

i   = 1, 1  i  r.

(3.8)

this condition characterizes the vector  as the level vector. next, the second condition
in (3.7) can be rewritten as {1 + max (  )}  1. but

hg = 1 + max (  )

(3.9)

is precisely the coxeter number of g, and we must have   1
, the
hg
contributions of all the roots except for the simple roots of g tend to 0. on the other hand,
when  = 1
, the highest root 0 realizing the maximum over  in (3.9) survives. since
hg
0 is the additional simple root for the ane lie algebra g(1), we arrive in this way at
the following theorem, which was proved in [11]

. thus when  < 1
hg

theorem 1. under the limit (3.4-3.5), with  = 1
, and  given by the level vector, the
hg
hamiltonian of the elliptic calogero-moser system for the simple lie algebra g tends to
the hamiltonian of the toda system for the ane lie algebra g(1).

scaling limit based on the dual coxeter number

if the seiberg-witten spectral curve of the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with
a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation is to be realized as the spectral curve for a
calogero-moser system, the parameter m in the calogero-moser system should correspond
to the mass of the hypermultiplet. in the gauge theory, the dependence of the coupling
constant on the mass m is given by

 =

m = m q

2h
g

(3.10)

where h
g is the quadratic casimir of the lie algebra g. this shows that the correct
physical limit, expressing the decoupling of the hypermultiplet as it becomes innitely
massive, is given by (3.4), but with  = 1
. to establish a closer parallel with our preceding
h
g
discussion, we recall that the quadratic casimir h
g coincides with the dual coxeter number
of g, dened by

h
g = 1 + max (  ),

for simply laced lie algebras g (ade algebras), we have hg = h

g , and the preceding
scaling limits apply. however, for non simply-laced algebras (bn, cn, g2, f4), we have
hg > h
g , and our earlier considerations show that the untwisted elliptic calogero-moser
hamiltonians do not tend to a nite limit under (3.10), q  0, m is kept xed. this is
why the twisted hamiltonian systems (2.6) have to be introduced. the twisting produces
precisely to an improvement in the asymptotic behavior of the potential which allows a
nite, non-trivial limit. more precisely, we can write

m2 (x) =

c

(3.12)

where c = 2. setting x = x  22, we obtain the following asymptotics

m2 (x) = cm 2(cid:26) e22()x + e22(1)+x ,

e22()x,

if  is long;
if  is short.

(3.13)

this leads to the following theorem [11]

g , with  the weyl vector and
theorem 2. under the limit x = x + 22
q  0, the hamiltonian of the twisted elliptic calogero-moser system for the simple lie
algebra g tends to the hamiltonian of the toda system for the ane lie algebra (g(1)).

this suggests that the twisted calogero-moser system is the integrable model solving
the n=2 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge algebra g since, in view of the work of
martinec and warner [24], it is the toda system for (g(1)) which solves the corresponding
pure yang-mills theory.

so far we have discussed only the scaling limits of the hamiltonians. however, similar
arguments show that the lax pairs constructed below also have nite, non-trivial scaling
limits whenever this is the case for the hamiltonians. the spectral parameter z should
scale as ez = zq
2 , with z xed. the parameter z can be identied with the loop group
parameter for the resulting ane toda system.

iv. lax pairs for calogero-moser systems

the general ansatz

let the rank of g be n, and d be its dimension. let  be a representation of g of
dimension n , of weights i , 1  i  n . let ui  cn be the weights of the fundamental
representation of gl(n, c). project orthogonally the ui s onto the i s as

sui = i + ui , i  vj .

(4.1)

8

it is easily veried that s2 is the second dynkin index. then

ij = i  j

(4.2)

is a weight of    associated to the root ui  uj of gl(n, c). the lax pairs for both
untwisted and twisted calogero-moser systems will be of the form

l = p + x, m = d + x,

(4.3)

where the matrices p, x, d, and y are given by

cij ij (ij , z)eij ,

x = xi6=j

y = xi6=j

cij 

ij (ij , z)eij

(4.4)

and by

p = p  h, d = d  (h  h) + .

(4.5)

here h is in a cartan subalgebra hg for g, h is in the cartan-killing orthogonal comple-
ment of hg inside a cartan subalgebra h for gl(n, c), and  is in the centralizer of hg
in gl(n, c). the functions ij (x, z) and the coecients cij are yet to be determined.
we begin by stating the necessary and sucient conditions for the pair l(z), m (z) of
(4.1) to be a lax pair for the (twisted or untwisted) calogero-moser systems. for this, it
is convenient to introduce the following notation

ij = ij (ij  x)

ij = ij (ij  x, z)

j i(ij  x, z)  ij (ij  x, z)

j i(ij  x, z).

(4.6)

then the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m (z)] implies the calogero-moser system if and only
if the following three identities are satised

xi6=j

cij cj i 

ij ij = s2 xr(g)

(4.7)

(4.8)

ij ckj kj

cik ik kj

(4.9)

 xk6=i,j

the following theorem was established in [10]:

9

theorem 3. a representation , functions ij , and coecients cij with a spectral
parameter z satisfying (4.7-4.9) can be found for all twisted and untwisted elliptic calogero-
moser systems associated with a simple lie algebra g, except possibly in the case of twisted
g2. in the case of e8, we have to assume the existence of a 1 cocycle.

lax pairs for untwisted calogero-moser systems

we now describe some important features of the lax pairs we obtain in this manner.

 in the case of the untwisted calogero-moser systems, we can choose ij (x, z) =

(x, z), ij (x) = (x) for all g.

  = 0 for all g, except for e8.

 for an, the lax pair (2.2-2.3) corresponds to the choice of the fundamental repre-
sentation for . a dierent lax pair can be found by taking  to be the antisymmetric
representation.

 for the bcn system, the lax pair is obtained by imbedding bn in gl(n, c) with
n = 2n + 1. when z = a (half-period), the lax pair obtained this way reduces to the
lax pair obtained by olshanetsky and perelomov [8,9].

 for the bn and dn systems, additional lax pairs with spectral parameter can be

found by taking  to be the spinor representation.

 for g2, a rst lax pair with spectral parameter can be obtained by the above
construction with  chosen to be the 7 of g2. a second lax pair with spectral parameter
can be obtained by restricting the 8 of b3 to the 7  1 of g2.

 for f4, a lax pair can be obtained by taking  to be the 26  1 of f4, viewed as

the restriction of the 27 of e6 to its f4 subalgebra.

 for e6,  is the 27 representation.

 for e7,  is the 56 representation.

 for e8, a lax pair with spectral parameter can be constructed with  given by the

248 representation, if coecients cij = 1 exist with the following cocycle conditions

c(,   )c(  , ) =c(,  + )c( + , )

when    =    = 1,    = 0

c(, )c(  , ) =c(,   )

when    =    = 1,    = 0

c(, )c(,   ) =  c(  , )

when    = 1.

(4.10)

10

the matrix  in the lax pair is then the 8  8 matrix given by

m2

b=1

ab = xa=1
 xa=1
aa = xa=1

b=1

2 (cid:0)c(a, )c(, b) + c(a, a  )c(a  , b)(cid:1)(  x)

m2

2 (cid:0)c(a, )c(, b) + c(a, a  )c(a  , b)(cid:1)(  x)

m2(  x) + 2m2(a  x),

(4.11)

where a, 1  a  8, is a maximal set of 8 mutually orthogonal roots.

we note that recently lax pairs of root type have been considered [20,25] which
correspond, in the above ansatz (4.3-5), to  equal to the adjoint representation of g and
the coecients cij vanishing for i or j associated with zero weights. this construction
yields another lax pair for the case e8. spectral curves for certain gauge theories with
matter in the adjoint representation have also been proposed in [26] and [27], based on
branes and m-theory.

lax pairs for twisted calogero-moser systems

recall that the twisted and untwisted calogero-moser systems dier only for non-
simply laced lie algebras, namely bn, cn, g2 and f4. these are the only algebras we
discuss in this paragraph. the construction (4.3-4.9) gives then lax pairs for all of them,
with the possible exception of twisted g2. unlike the case of untwisted lie algebras
however, the functions ij have to be chosen with care, and dier for each algebra. more
specically,

 for bn, the lax pair is of dimension n = 2n, admits two independent couplings m1

and m2, and

ij (x, z) =(cid:26) (x, z),

2( 1

2 x, z),

if i  j 6= 0, n
if i  j = n

.

here a new function 2(x, z) is dened by

2(

1
2

x, z) =

( 1

2 x, z)( 1

2 x + 1, z)

(1, z)

(4.12)

(4.13)

 for cn, the lax pair is of dimension n = 2n + 2, admits one independent coupling

m2, and

where ij are given by

ij (x, z) = 2(x + ij , z),

ij =( 0,

2,
2,

if i 6= j = 1, 2,    , 2n + 1;
if 1  i  2n, j = 2n + 2;
if 1  j  2n, i = 2n + 2.

(4.14)

11

 for f4, the lax pair is of dimension n = 24, two independent couplings m1 and

m2,

(x, z) =


(x, z),
1(x, z),
2( 1
2 x, z),

if    = 0;
if    = 1
2 ;
if    = 1.

(4.15)

where the function 1(x, z) is dened by

1(x, z) = (x, z)  ei(z)+1z(x + 1, z)

(4.16)

here it is more convenient to label the entries of the lax pair directly by the weights
 = i and  = j instead of i and j.

 for g2, candidate lax pairs can be dened in the 6 and 8 representations of g2,
but it is still unknown whether elliptic functions ij (x, z) exist which satisfy the required
identities.

v. calogero-moser and spin calogero-moser

spectral curves

a lax pair l(z), m (z) with spectral parameter gives rise to a spectral curve  dened

by

 = {(k, z); r(k, z)  det(ki  l(z)) = 0}

(5.1)

since the matrix l(z) is expressed in terms of the dynamical variables of the calogero-
moser system, the family of spectral curves  can be parametrized by constants of motion of
the system. however, to make contact with supersymmetric gauge theories, it is important
to nd parametrizations of the spectral curves in terms of the order parameters of the gauge
theory. this problem was solved for the an1 calogero-moser systems in [3]. here we
extend the solution given there to the more general class of sl(n, c) spin calogero-moser
systems.

the sl(n, c) spin calogero-moser system introduced by krichever et al. [15] is the

system with hamiltonian

the terms ai = (ai), bi = (bi) are respectively l-dimensional vectors and l-dimensional
covectors, and b
i aj is their scalar product. the system (5.2) admits a lax pair l(z), m (z)
which is a generalization of (2.2). in particular, l(z) is given by

krichever et al. have shown that the corresponding family of spectral curves  is a n l 
2 l(l  1)-dimensional family of riemann surfaces of genus g = n l + 1  1
1
2 l(l + 1). the
dening equation r(k, z) = 0 can be expressed in the form

r(k, z) = kn +

ri(z)ki

n1

xi=0

where ri(z), 0  i  n  1, is an elliptic function with a pole of order n  i. since elliptic
functions can be expanded linearly in terms of (z) and (z), the family of spectral curves
 can be parametrized by the coecients of ri(z) in such an expansion. the number of
these coecients exceeds n l  1
[15] show that
the correct number of parameters can be obtained by imposing linear constraints on the
coecients.

2 l(l  1) however, and krichever et al.

we present now a dierent parametrization of the spectral curves of the spin calogero-
moser systems, motivated by the order parameters of n = 2 supersymmetric su (n ) gauge
theories. as in [3], we introduce the functions hn(z) by

hn(z) =

| )

z 1( z
n
21
1( z
21

| )

, n  n.

and set

f (k, z) = r(k + mh1(z), z).

theorem 4. the function f (k, z) can be expressed as

f (k, z) =

l

xp=1

p1
z

(cid:0)

1( 1

k )| )

(z  m

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

hp(k)(cid:1)

where hp(k) is a polynomial in k of degree n  p + 1, for 1  p  l.

the polynomial h1(k) is monic because r(k, z) and f (k, z) are. as for the polynomials
hp(k) with p > 1, their terms of order k0 do not contribute in (5.7) and may be taken
to be 0. thus we note that the total number of parameters for the l monic polynomials
2 l(l  1), which is indeed the dimension of the family

p=1(n  p + 1) = ln  1

of spectral curves  for the sl(n, c) spin calogero-moser system.

hp(k) is pl

13

proof of theorem 4. it is easily seen from the transformation properties of h1(z) that the
transformation properties for f (k, z) are

f (k, z + 21) =f (k, z)

f (k, z + 22) =f (k  m, z),  = 

i
1

(5.8)

furthermore, the function f (k, z) has poles at z = 0, with the residue a polynomial in
k of degree n  p at a pole of order p. now the functions hn(z) satisfy the monodromy
conditions

hn(z + 21) =h(z)

hn(z + 22) =

n

xp=0(cid:18) n

p(cid:19) nphp(z).

it follows that the monodromies for their derivatives are

s
zhn(z + 21) =s

zh(z)
n

s
zhn(z + 22) =

xp=1(cid:18) n

p(cid:19) nps

zhp(z).

(5.9)

(5.10)

(the p = 0 term in the second identity does not contribute since h0(z) = 1.) note also
that zh1(z) = 2

1(z) is doubly periodic. thus we may set

| ) = 42

z log 1( z
21

f (k, z) =

l

np+1

xp=1

xn=0

qp,np+1n(k)p1

z

hn(z).

(5.11)

next, we translate the monodromy transformations for f (k, z) in terms of the polynomials
qp,np+1n(k). we may write

n

f (k, z) =

f (k, z + 22) =

hn(z)qp,np+1n(k)

n

np+1

p1

xn=1

but the functions hn(z), 0  n  n , and p1
independent. thus we may equate coecients and obtain for q1,ns(k) the relation

hn(z), 1  n  n , 2  p  l, are linearly

z

q1,ns =

n

xn=0(cid:18) n

s(cid:19) nsq1,nn(k)

changing n  s  p and n  n  n, this can be rewritten as

q1,p(k  m) =

n

xn=0(cid:18) n  n

p  n (cid:19) pnq1,n(k)

(5.13)

(5.14)

this is a relation of the form studied in [5],(3.9). we recall briey the argument: the
equation (5.14) is equivalent to the equation h(t + , k + m) = h(t, k) where h(t, k) =
p=0 tnpq1,p(k) is the generating function. since h(t, k) is a polynomial in both t and k,
this means that h(t, k) = h(0, k  tm) depends only on k  tm. setting h1(k) = h(0, k),
it follows easily that

pn

q1,nn(k) =

(m)n

n!

h (n)

(k).

(5.15)

(5.16)

next, we solve for the higher order terms qp,np+1s(k). they satisfy

qp,np+1s(k  m) =

np+1

xn=1 (cid:18) n

s(cid:19) nsqp,np+1n(k)

this is again a relation of the form (5.14), with n replaced by n  p + 1. thus there is
again a polynomial hp(k), of degree n  p + 1 so that

qp,np+1(k) =

(m)s

s!

h (s)

p (k).

substituting in (5.11), and noting that

1( 1

=



xn=0

hn(z)

(5.17)

(5.18)

we obtain the desired expression (5.7).

evidently, the coecients of the polynomials hp(k) (or equivalently, their zeroes) are
integrals of motion of the spin calogero-moser system. it would be valuable to express
them directly in terms of the dynamical variables (pi, xi) of the system. for the su (n )
calogero-moser system, this problem was solved in [28].

finally, we would like to note also that in the simpler case of the su (n ) calogero-
moser system, an alternative derivation of the parametrization in [3] is now available [29].
it would be interesting to explore also generalizations of this new derivation.
