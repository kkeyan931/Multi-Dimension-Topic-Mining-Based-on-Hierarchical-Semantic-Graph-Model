abstract

in this paper, we give the general crossing relation for boundary re-
ection matrix r() ,which is the extension of the work given by ghoshal
and zamolodchikov .we also use the rst non-trivial extended crossing
relation to determine the scaler factor of r() which is the rational di-
agonal solution to the boundary yang-baxter equation in the case of l=2
and n=3.

introduction

much work has recently been done in integrable quantum eld theory and lattice

statistical mechanics on models with a boundary , where the integrability is

guaranteed by the boundary yang-baxter equation ( bybe ) . an exact solution

to such a eld theory could provide a better undstanding of boundary-related

phenomena in statistical systems near criticality[1]. in statistical mechanics,the

emphasis has been on deriving solutions of bybe and calculation of various

surface critical phenomena, both at and away from criticality[8,9].

an important character of an integrable eld theory is its factorizable scat-

tering matrix (s-matrix). in the bulk theory , the factorizable s-matrix is

completely determined in terms of the two-particle s-matrix ,which should sat-

isfy the yang-baxter equation(ybe), in addtion to the standard equations of

unitarity and crossing relation[2,3] . the general crossing relation was given

by y.h. quano[6] .these equations have much restrictive power, determining

the s-matrix up to the so-called cdd ambiguity .recently, much important

progress in the boundary integrable model is that ghoshal and zamolodchikov

gave the approprite anolog of the crossing relation for boundary reection ma-

trix (r-matrix) in the ref.[3].together with bybe and unitarity for boundary

r-matrix,the above equations have exactly the same restrictive power as the

corresponding bulk  system ,i.e. they allow one to pin down the facterizable

boundary r-matrix up to the cdd factors . this crossing relation also play

a very important role in solving boundary integrable spin chain (e.g boundary

xxz model [4] and boudary xyz model[5]). however, it was known that the

crossing relation gave by ghoshal and zamolodchikov is only the special case

(n=2) of the general one.
crossing relation for boundary r-matrix (i.e for any a(1)

n case)

in this paper, we will give the general version of

2

2 the general boundary crossing relation

for an integrable boundary massive eld theory, the scattering theory is purely

elastic and the corresponding scattering matrix is factorizable. besides the bulk

scattering processes (which is described by two-particle s-matrix s()),there

exist a process which represents the particles reecting with the boundary.this

process is described by boundary r-matrix r() .the factorization of scattering

in the boundary case is equivalent to validity of ybe and bybe

ybe :

s12(1  2)s13(1  3)s23(2  3)

= s23(2  3)s13(1  3)s12(1  2)

,

bybe : s12(1  2)r1(1)s21(1 + 2)r2(2)

= r2(2)s12(1 + 2)r1(1)s21(1  2)

,

(1)

(2)

where s() is the same one as in the bulk case and boundary r-matrix should

satisfy the requirements of unitary

r()r() = 1

.

(3)

as the usual conventions,smn() signies the matrix on v  v...  v acting

on the m-th and n-th component and as identity on the other ones, and rk()

signies the matrix on tensor space acting on th k-th component and as identity

on the other ones.

2.1 the general boundary crossing relation

we only consider the solution to ybe which has the following property

s(w) = p ()

2  (something)

,

(4)

where w is so-called crossing parameter (it is usally rescaling as i ) ,and p ()

2

is the completely antisymmetric project operator in v 2. in fact, in addition

to rational and elliptic solution to ybe having properties ( 4) ,there exist a

3

series trigonometric solution to ybe (which is the trigonometrical limit of zn

belavin solution ) carrying with property ( 4).

due to the property ( 4),one can construct the completely antisymmetric

fusion procedure for r-matrix[10,11,12].first, we give some notation about fusion.

let v = c n ( 2 n) and v  be the dual space of v .then we have a homorphism

c :

ce

i =

c :

v   n1(v ) and

i1...in1
i

ei1  ...  ein1

,

1

p(n  1)!

where e

i is the base of dual space v  and i1....in1

i

is the n-th order completely

antisymmetric tensor. through the fusion procedure for r-matrix ,one can

obtain

theorem 2.1 for any integral l (l  n) , dene

r(l)() :

v l  v l by

r(l)() = rl( + lw)sl1,l(2 + (2l  1)w)...r1( + w)

then image of r(l)()|(l)(v ) is also in (l)(v ) .furthermore,we can dene

r() :

v   v 

by

r() = c 1p ()

n1rn( + (n  1)w)sn1,n(2 + (2n  3)w)

.....r2( + w)p ()

n1c

.

(5)

[proof :]

from ybe and the properties ( 4), it is easy to see the following properties

s12(w)s13(2w)...s1l((l  1)w)s23(w)....sl1,l(w)

= p ()

l  m ,

sl,l1(w)sl,l2(2w)...sl1((l  1)w)sl1,l2(w)....s21(w)

= p ()

l  m 

,

4

(6)

(7)

where p ()

l

is completely antisymmetric project operator in v l and m, m  

end(v l) .using the ybe and bybe, one have

[s12(w)s13(2w)...s1l((l  1)w)s23(w)....sl1,l(w)] 

r1( + w)s21(2 + 3w)...sl1(2 + (l + 1)w)r2( + 2w)

...rl( + lw)

= r(l)()[sl,l1(w)sl,l2(2w)...sl1((l  1)w)sl1,l2(w)

....s21(w)]

.

thanks to properties (6) and (7), this means that

p ()
l r(l)()p ()

l = r(l)()p ()

l

(8)

(9)

,

so it ensure us that im(r(l)())|(l) (v )  (l)(v ) .
we are now in a position to mention the crossing relation for generic n .because

the crossing relation of boundary r-matrix is mainly considered,let us assume

that our r() has already enjoyed in the unitarity :r()r() = 1 , and s()

enjoyed in unitarity and crossing symmetry[6]

s12()s21() = 1

,

[sv,v 

where

()]jl

ik = s(  nw)kj

li

,

(10)

sv,v 

() = (1  c 1)(1  p ()

n1)s1n( + (n  1)w)....s12( + w)

(1  p ()

n1)(1  c)

.

using the denition of r() ,the unitarity of s() and r() ,one can nd

r() with the following inversion relation

r()r(  nw) = 1

.

(11)

theorem 2.2 r() which is obtained through fusion of r() can also be

directly expressed into

[r()]k

j = d()[sv,v (2 + nw)]lj

kl [r(  nw)]l

l

,

(12)

5

where d() is a scaler factor (actually it is the quantum determinator of r()

)

[proof:]

owing to the fact that dim(n(v ) is equal to 1 and theorem 2.1 ,one have

[r()]k

m[sv,v 

xm,l,l

(2)]jm

ll [r()]l

l = d()jk

,

where d() is a scaler factor which depends on r() and s() .using the

inversion relation (11) and the crossing symmetry of s() (10), one can obtain

[r()]k

j = d()[sv,v (2 + nw)]lj

kl [r(  nw)]l

l

.

(12a)

due to (12),one can reduce d() to 1 through rescaling the boundary matrix

r() .therefore,one can determine the scaler factor of r() using the following

relation

[r()]k

j = [sv,v (2 + nw)]lj

kl [r(  nw)]l

l

.

this relation can be considered as the generalization crossing relation for generic

n.when one considers v  ,circumstances slightly change between n=2 and n > 2

case . speaking in terms of young tableau , v =  ,the fundamental repre-

sentation sln, while v  corresponds to vertical n-1 s ,the space of antisym-

metric tensors in v n1 .thus v and v  can be identied even at the level of

young tableau if and only if n=2 .for n > 2 , more complex procedure than

(5) is needed and (12a) is non-trivial extension of crossing relation for n > 2 .

however,when n is equal to 2 ,the restricted condition for scaler factor of r()

become the same as that given by ghoshal and zamolodchikov.we have checked

it for the rational ,trigonometric and elliptical type solution to bybe.

hence,in order to determine the exact boundary reecting matrix ,one can

impose the following condition on r() (bybe,unitarity,crossing relation)

bybe : s12(1  2)r1(1)s21(1 + 2)r2(2)

= r2(2)s12(1 + 2)r1(1)s21(1  2)

,

(13)

unitarity

r()r() = 1

,

crossing relation :

[r()]k

j = [sv,v (2 + nw)]lj

kl [r(  nw)]l

l

(14)

.(15)

the above condition can only reduce the scaler factor up to some cdd factor

() which should also be generalized as satisfying follow requirement

()() = 1 ,

n

yl=1

( + lw) = 1

.

(16)

when n=2 ,the above requirement return the usual one.moreover,this ambiguity

can be canceled by some dynamical requirement[2,3].

2.2 an example

to determine the exact boundary reecting matrix r() ,the following proce-

dure are usually taken : rst,one obtain the solution to (13) upon to some scaler

factor;then, the unitarity (14) and crossing relation (15) are used to determine

the scaler factor.in this subsection, we obtain the rational diagonal solution to

bybe for generic n. then without losing the generality, the rst nontrivial

extension of crossing relation are applied to determine the scaler factor for n=3.

here,we consider the rational solution to ybe with unitarity and crossing

relation satised,which is given as follows

s() = a()1 + b()p

= k()(



 + w

1 +

w

 + w

p )

,

where p is the permutation operator in v 2:

p (ei  ej) = ej  ei

and scaler factor k() is equal to

k() = 

( 
( 

nw )( 
nw )( 

nw + 1
nw + 1

nw )
nw )

.

the bybe leads to the following functional equations

a(1 + 2)b(1  2)rk

j (1)rl

i(2) + a(1  2)b(1 + 2)ri

i (1)rl

i (2)k

j

+b(1 + 2)b(1  2)ri

j (1)rl

i (2)k

i

= a(1 + 2)b(1  2)rl

i(1)rk

j (2) + a(1  2)b(1 + 2)rk

i (1)ri

j (2)l

i

+b(1 + 2)b(1  2)rl

i (1)ri

j (2)k

i

.

in the diagonal case ,i.e rj

i () = ri()j

i , the above equations become

a(1 + 2)b(1  2)[rj(1)ri(2)  ri(1)rj (2)]

= a(1  2)b(1 + 2)[rj(1)rj(2)  ri(1)ri(2)]

.

(17)

the solution to (17) is

r() = (cid:26) r()

,
r() 

+ ,

i  n  l

if
otherwise

(17a)

this diagonal solution has two parameters :l  n and   c ,which has the

same structure as the diagonal solution for trigonometric solution given by de

vega[7] .

only for simplicity but without losing the generality,we only consider the

crossing relation of this solution (17a) for l=2 and n=3,namely,r() is equal to

1

1

r()



+


 .

using the fusion for r() ,one can get

r() =

r( + w)r( + 2w)k(2 + 3w)(    2w)( + w)

( + 2w)( +  + w)

1

1




++w
2w




.

on the other hand,from the crossing relation (15), one should obtain

r() =

r(  3w)k(2 + 3w)( + 3w)(    2w)

( + 2w)(    3w)

1

1




++w
2w

.

so, unitarity and crossing relation (14) and (15) lead to the requirements for

the scaler factor r()

r()r() = 1

,

r( + w)r( + 2w)r( + 3w) =

( +  + w)( + 3w)
(    3w)( + w)

.

solving the above equations,one can obtain the scaler factor r() upon to

cdd ambiguity,

r() = 

( 
( 
3w + 1
3w + 1

3w )( +
3w + 1
3 )
3w )( 
3w + 1
3 )
3 )( 
3w )
3 )( +
3w )



( 
( 

 ()

,

(21)

where () is a cdd factor which satises equations

()() = 1

,

( + w)( + 2w)( + 3w) = 1

.

(22)

the equations (22) which cdd factors should be satised is the generalized

version of n=2 case .
