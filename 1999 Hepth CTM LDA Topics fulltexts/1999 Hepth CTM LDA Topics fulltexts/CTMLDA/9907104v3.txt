abstract

we construct the georgi-glashow lagrangian for gauge group suq(n).
breaking this symmetry spontaneously gives q-dependent masses of gauge
eld and vacuum manifold. it turned out that the vacuum manifold is param-
eterized by the non-commutative quantities. we showed that the monopole
solutions exist in this model, which is indicated by the presence of the bps
states.

introduction

the notion of the lie group has been generalized by drinfeld[1], jimbo[2],
and woronowicz[3]. their generalized lie group, i.e., noncommutative and
non-cocommutative hopf algebra, is now known as the quantum group un-
der an enthusiastic study by lot of mathematicians and physicists. several
authors have attempted to quantize or q-deform the lorentz group[4].

on the other hand, the georgi-glashow model, which is a simple theory
in 3+1 dimensional, has been studied by many authors such as t hooft-
polyakov[5] and julia-zee[6] . this model has a solitonic solution, called
monopole, in the higgs vacuum[5, 6].

the purpose of this paper is to generalize the georgi-glashow model for
the case of quantum group, and to show that there exists a solitonic solution
in general case. we shall be concerned only quantum group suq(n) with
the simplest example of quantum group, suq(2), since it reduces to su(2)
for q = 1. we construct the georgi-glashow lagrangian (also with -term),
and then we dene the variation of lagrangian. we nd that the equation of
motion, besides elds, depends on the quantities which are independent of the
representation of the gauge group and a noncommutative factor. breaking
the gauge symmetry spontaneously gives q-dependent masses of gauge and
vacuum manifold. vacuum manifold is parameterized by the gauge invariant
quantity, which is similar to seiberg-witten theory[10] (an excellent review
on this subject is given by alvarez-gaume-hassan[7]), and for this model, in
which the gauge group is quantum group, the parameter of vacuum manifold
is noncommutative. we also derive the eld strength corresponding to the
unbroken subgroup and the q-dependent bps bound mass.

the basis of theory presented here are the notion of the dierential calcu-
lus on suq(2) which was developed by woronowicz[3] and the suq(2) yang-
mills theory which was constructed by hirayama[8].

this paper is organized as follows. first we review the suq(2) theory in
section ii, this review section is taken almost verbatim from hirayama[8]. in
section iii we present the suq(n) georgi-glashow theory. the discussion of
bps states and the vacuum manifold of the model is presented in section iv.
section v is devoted for conclusion and outlook.

ii. the suq(2) and yang-mills theory

a. suq(2) transformation

we briey review the suq(2) theory which was developed by woronow-

icz[3]. the fundamental representation of suq(2) is given by

 (cid:19) ,
w =(cid:18)  q



where , , , are operators satisfying certain algebras[8].

(2.1)

we denote r as polynomial rings which are generated by i, , , ,and
and mn (b) as a set of n  n matrices whose entries belong to the set
b. let r be the set of the representations of r whose operators act on a
hilbert space h[3]. we dene the product of w1and w2 as[3]

w1w2 =(cid:18) 2  1  q

2  1 + 

2  
2  1 q (
2  

2  1

1 + 2  
1)
1  q2  

1 (cid:19)  m2 (r  r) ,

(2.2)
which acts on h  h and it is closely related to the coproduct dened on
r. the -operation is the complex conjugate for complex numbers. the
-product of operators r or r is dened by

(a1  a2  ...  an) (b1  b2  ...  bn) = a1b1  a2b2  ...  anbn.
(2.3)
we denote the set of wm  wm1  ...  w1 as cm and it has inverse c 1
m .

b. group theoretic representation of w

in this subsection we review the group-theoretic representation of suq (2)
which was studied by woronowicz[3]. it turned out that the representation
theory of suq (2) is quite similar to that of su (2) . the matrix w  mn (r)is
said to be the representation of w if it satises[3]

 (wij) = (w  w )ij 

nxk=1

wik  wkj

3

; i, j = 1, 2, ..., n ,

(2.4)

where  is the coproduct which is dened as

 (w) (cid:18)  ()  (q)

 ()  () (cid:19) = w  w,

(2.5)

we dene the set c n

m by

(2.6)
where wi  mn (r) , i = 1, 2, ..., m are the canonical representations of
wi  m2 (r) , i = 1, 2, ..., m , respectively.

c n
m = {wm  wm1  ...  w1} ,

c.

3d calculus of suq (2)

the dierential calculus of suq (2) is discussed in woronowicz[3], in which
coordinates are non-commutative operators. the 3d calculus which was
studied by woronowicz[3], is not only left-covariant but also has simple struc-
ture and mysteriously works well even for the higher order dierential calculi.
here we briey recapitulate the 3d calculus of woronowicz.

the linear functionals 0, 1, 2, f0, f1, f2, e on r are dened by

0 (w)  (cid:18) 0 () 0 (q)
1 (w) = (cid:18) 1

0 ()
0

0

0 0 (cid:19) ,
0 () (cid:19) =(cid:18) 0 1
q 0 (cid:19) , k (i) = 0,
q2 (cid:19) , fk (i) = 1,

0 q2 (cid:19) , 2 (w) =(cid:18) 0
q (cid:19) , f1 (w) =(cid:18) q2
0 1 (cid:19) , e (i) = 1,

k = 0, 1, 2 .

0

f0 (w) = f2 (w) =(cid:18) q1 0
e (w) =(cid:18) 1 0

0

0

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

the convolution product of a linear functional x on r, and a  r, is

dened by

x  a =xi

x (a

i) a

i  r

4

(2.10)

where a
is dened by

i and a

i are given by  (a) =pi a

i a

i . the dierential operator d

da =

(k  a) k,

a  r,

(2.11)

2xk=0

where k, k = 0, 1, 2, are the bases of the space of dierential 1-forms. the
higher order dierential calculus can be dened to maintain the property

the hermitian k (w ) of k (w )  mn (c) is given by

d2 = 0.

(2.12)

k (w ) =

2xj=0

tkjj (w ) ,

(2.13)

where t11 = 1, t02 = 1

q , and t20 = q.

d. local suq (2)

let x = (x0, x1, x2, x3) be coordinates of the four dimensional minkowski
spacetime and  (x) ,  (x) ,  (x) ,  (x)  r be the x-dependent represen-
tations of , , ,   r respectively, as operators acting on the hilbert
space h introduced in 2.1. to discuss the eld theory of suq (2), it is in-
evitable to consider the functions of x,  (x) ,  (x) ,  (x) ,  (x) and their
derivatives with respect to x. we denote the set of functions of the form
g [x]  g (x,  (x) ,  (x) ,  (x) ,  (x)) by rx. the functional x x on rx
should be introduced so that x x (w (x)) = x (w), e.g.,

x
k (w (x)) = k (w) , f x

k (w (x)) = fk (w) , ex (w (x)) = e (w) ,

where w (x) is dened by

 (x) (cid:19) ,
w (x) =(cid:18)  (x) q (x)

 (x)

5

k = 0, 1, 2 ,
(2.14)

(2.15)

and w, k, fk, and e are those dened hitherto. recalling (2.11), the dier-
ential operator dx should be dened to act on g [x] as

2xk=0

dxg [x] =

(x

k  g [x]) x

k + (g [x]) dx,

(2.16)

where x
k ,k = 0, 1, 2 are the analogue of the previous k and g [x] is
the conventional partial derivative of g [x] with respect to the explicit x-
dependence of g [x]. a consistent set of rules is derived from the result of
woronowicz[3] by supposing that x
k,dx and

k and dxg [x] decompose as x

(dg [x]) dx respectively, and assuming that {dx, dx} = (cid:2)dx, x

[dx, a] = 0, a  rx, ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3. we call the above procedure as the
z-procedure[8]. the z-procedure leads us to the following denition of the
partial derivative dg [x] of g [x]  rx,

k,(cid:3) =

dg [x] =

2xk=0

(x

k  g [x]) x

k, + g [x] .

(2.17)

e. the suq(2) yang-mills theory

in this subsection, we briey review the suq(2) yang-mills theory con-
structed by hirayama[8]. we suppose that the components of the gauge eld,
ak,(x) , i = 0, 1, 2,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. we postulate that

a,i(x)w (x) = w (x)fi()a,i(x),

a,i(x)a,j(x) = cjia,j(x)a,i(x),

a

i,(x) =

tjiaj,(x),

2xk=0

where t02 = q, t20 = q1, and t11 = 1.
throughout this subsection we denote

n(x)  w

in (2.21), g is the gauge coupling constant,

(2.23)

and k(w1) is equal to x

the transformation law of f w

(f w

= (w (x)  im)(in  f w
= f w w

 (x))(w 1(x)  im)

(2.29)

the lagrangian density of the local suq(2) invariant eld theory should
be independent of the choice of w (x), the dimensionality n and the integer
m.

we begin with dening sw

kl by

sw
kl = tr(n k(w )(n )2l(w ), w  c n

1 , k, l = 0, 1, 2,

where n is given by n = (n )1. if we dene kn by

(2.30)

(2.31)

kn = 

q

20(cid:1)1
8(cid:0)sw

, w  c n

then the product kn sw

is independent of w . then the gauge invariant

lw
gg(x) = kn tr(n  (w )f w, (w ) (w )f w

  (w ) ) ,

(2.32)

where

 (w ) = (wm(x)  ...  w2(x)  n i)w 1(x) .

(2.33)

iii. the suq(n) georgi-glashow theory

a. gauge field and scalar field

we introduce the gauge eld and the scalar eld which are elds that
present in the georgi-glashow model. we consider the components of gauge

8

elds and scalar elds are ak,(x) and i(x),where i = 0, 1, ..., n2  2, and
 = 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively.
if i, i = 0, 1, ..., n2  2 are elds, then we generalize the hirayamas

postulate to

i(x)w (x) = w (x)fi()i(x),

i(x)j(x) = cjij(x)i(x).

from the equation (2.22), we generalize the vector eld ak,(x) to

a(x) =

a,k(x) k(w1),

n22xk=0

and its transformation are given by

aw
 (x) = w (x)(im1  a(x))w 1(x) 

1
ig

(dw (x))w 1(x),

(3.4)

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

and for the scalar eld (x)

(x) =

n22xk=0

k(x) k(w1),

w (x) = w (x)(im1  (x))w 1(x).

the additional property of the gauge eld is

tji aj,(x) ,

a

i,(x) =

and for the generator is

k (w1) =

n22xk=0

n22xj=0

9

tkj j (w1) .

(3.8)

if we transform aw

 (x) to (aw

 (x))w  and w (x) to (w (x))w  , then we

get

(aw

 (x))w 

= (w (x)  im)(in  aw

 (x))(w 1(x)  im)

(3.9)

1
ig



(dw



(x))w

1(x)  im,

(w (x))w 



= (w

(x)  im)(in  w (x))(w 1(x)  im).

(3.10)

thus we have

(aw

 (x))w 

= aw w



(x),

(w (x))w 

= w w (x),

(3.11)

(3.12)

which have the same form as the equation (2.25).

for the scalar part, the transformation law of w

 w is also given by

 w (x))w 

(w

= (w (x)  im)(in  w
= ((x))w w .

 w (x))(w 1(x)  im) (3.13)

b. the construction of georgi-glashow lagrangian

a similar reason from the previous section can be applied that the la-
grangian density of the local suq(n) invariant eld theory should be inde-
pendent of the choice of w (x), the dimensionality n and the integer m.

we begin with dening sw

kl by

sw
kl = tr(n k(w )(n )2l(w ), w  c n
1 ,

k, l = 0, 1, ..., n2  2

(3.14)

where n is given by n = (n )1. if we dene kn by

10

kn = 

then the product kn sw
kl

q

8(cid:0)sw
ij(cid:1)1

, w  c n
1 ,
is independent of w .

i, j = 0, 1, ..., n2  2

we now dene the  -quantities of any function f w (x) by

(f w (x)) =  (w )f w (x) (w ),

where

 (w ) = (wm(x)  ...  w2(x)  n i)w 1(x),

and f w (x) is function f (x) and transform with respect to the gauge trans-
formation w (x)  c n
m .
if we transform the  -quantities of any function
f w (x) by the gauge transformation w (x)  c n

n , then its transform to

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

(cid:0)f w (x)(cid:1)

(cid:16)f w w (x)(cid:17)

then we construct the georgi-glashow lagrangian by

=  (w   w )f w w (x) (w   w ).

(3.18)

lw

gg(x) = kn tr(cid:0)n(cid:0)

(f w

 ) (cid:0)f w,(cid:1)

+(w

where

(w

 w (x)), = ( (w )w
=  (w )(w

 w (x) (w ))
 w (x)) (w )

(3.19)

))

(3.20)

as we expect, the pseudoscalar quantity is also gauge invariant, i.e.,

kn tr(cid:16)n (f w

 ) (ef w,)(cid:17) ,

2 f w

 and  is the levi-civita symbol for 3+1 di-

(3.21)

where ef w, = 1

then according to witten[9], we can construct georgi-glashow model

with an additional term

))

c. equation of motion

before we derive the equation of motion from lagrangian (3.19) and
(3.22), rst we must dene the variation of the lagrangian. given any func-
tion of i and di, where i is a eld with i = 0, 1, ..., n22, then variation
of l(i, di) is dened by

l(i, di) =xi (cid:18)i

l
i

+  (di)

l

 (di)(cid:19) = 0,

(3.23)

where 
i
spectively. from the above denition we get the equation of motion

(di) are the usual partial derivative of i and di, re-

and



l

i  d(cid:18) l

 (di)(cid:19) = 0.

(3.24)

we can write the equation (3.19) in component elds

2xk,l=0

l +xj

tjk()

j()l + (cid:2), (cid:3)k(cid:2), (cid:3)l! .

(3.25)

from equation (3.23), we can dene the energy-momentum tensor as

12

t xl

l (cid:17)
nx(i)=1(cid:16)d(i)

l

(cid:16)d(i)

l (cid:17)   l , (i) = 1, 2, ...n,

(3.26)

where index (i) are numbers of elds and  = diag(1, 1, 1, 1) is the metric
tensor. then by equation (3.24), we get the equation of motion for the
lagrangian (3.25)

we called the equation (3.30) as the bianchi constraint.

in the case of classical lie group, the bianchi identity, ef  = 0, where

 =  + iga, and the bianchi constraint, equation (3.30), coincides.
but in the case of quantum group they are dierent, because the bianchi
identity comes from the geometry while the bianchi constraint comes from
the variation of lagrangian. the relation between them is not clear until
now.

we see from equations (3.25) until (3.30), there are always appear quanti-
ties kn sw
kl which are always independent of the choice of the representation
of the gauge group and a noncommutative factor clk. we will see later that
both quantities are also appear in the parameter of the vacuum manifold,
i.e. u2, in the eld strength corresponding with unbroken subgroups, and in
the bps bound mass.

iv. bps states and vacuum manifold of the model

a. vacuum manifold of the model

in this section we begin to nd the vacuum conguration in this the-
ory. we start with the energy-momentum tensor of the model which can be
derived from lagrangian (3.25), that is (without the -term)

then we dene a norm denoted byk k, i.e., k k : fnc  r, where fnc

is a noncommutative eld and r is a real eld , such that

and it vanishes only if

ktk  0,

f 
a = 0,  = 0,

v () = 0.

14

(4.2)

(4.3)

the rst equation in (4.3) implies that in the vacuum, f 
a

is pure gauge
and the last two equations dene the higgs vacuum. the structure of the
space of vacua is determined by

v () =xk,l

kn sw

kl (cid:2), (cid:3)k(cid:2), (cid:3)l = 0.

(4.4)

therefore, the higgs vacuum is dened by(cid:2), (cid:3) = 0, which implies that 

takes values in the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group suq(n). we denote
by uq(1)n1 a subgroup of suq(n), which is generated by elements of the
cartan subalgebra of the gauge group suq(n). it is clear that uq(1)n1 is
the unbroken subgroup of suq(n) which keeps the higgs vacuum invariant.
there the georgi-glashow model has a family of vacuum states. vacuum
manifold, which is formed by the potential (4.4), parameterized by gauge
invariant quantities. for this model, we have the gauge invariant quantity
parameterizing the space of vacua, that is

which is similar to seiberg-witten theory [10]. for suq(2) gauge group, the
parameter un in (4.5) is

) ,

(4.5)

un = kn tr(n(cid:0)(cid:2)w(cid:3)(cid:1)n
u2 = kn tr(n(cid:0)(cid:2)w(cid:3)(cid:1)2

) .

as we mention above, if we write the above equations in their components,
then quantities kn skl appears in the parameter of the vacuum manifold.
then, up to a gauge transformation , we can take  = a1, so the parameter
u2 in (4.6) becomes

(4.6)

(4.7)

u2 =

8(cid:0)1 + q2(cid:1) a2  u,

where a  cnc and cnc is the noncommutative complex eld.

in this subsection, we derive the solution of the second equation in (4.3),
then nd the eld strength corresponding to the unbroken part of the gauge
group, i.e., uq(1)n1.

let (v)

i denote the eld i in a higgs vacuum. it then satises the equa-

tions

(cid:2)(v), (v)(cid:3) = 0,
d(v) + ig(cid:2)a, (v)(cid:3) = 0.

we nd that the solution of the second equation in (4.9) is

in this subsection, we derive the bogomolnyi bound[14] on the mass of
dyon in terms of its electric and magnetic charge, which are sources for the
equation (4.18). we dene the electric and magnetic charge as

a = 1, 2, 3,

respectively, where x is a manifold and x is the boundary of x. from

equation (4.18) and the bianchi identity, ef  = 0, the electric and mag-

netic charge can be written as

q =xk,l

we see that there exist u transformation such that(cid:0)sw(cid:1)t = sw u, where t

we propose that there exists  > 0 such that the above equation becomes

and it turns out that  = kukq=1 kckq=1 because the model will reduce to the
su(2) case when n = 2 and q = 1[5,6,7,11,12].

v. conclusion and outlook

in this paper, we have constructed the suq(n) georgi-glashow model
(also with -term). the equation of motion, besides the elds, depends on
quantities kn sw
kl which are independent of the representation of the gauge
group and a noncommutative factor clk. in the case of classical lie group,
the bianchi identity and the bianchi constraint, equation (3.30), coincides.
but in the case of quantum group they are dierent, because the bianchi
identity comes from the geometry while the bianchi constraint comes from
the variation of lagrangian. the relation between them is not clear until now.
we break the gauge symmetry spontaneously and this gives rise to the masses
of gauge eld which depend on q and a, where a is the vacuum parameter.
the vacuum manifold is parameterized by the gauge invariant quantity which
depends on a scalar eld . we get the eld strength corresponding to the
unbroken subgroup, uq(1)n1, and the q-dependent bps bound mass.

for further work, we extend the problem to the supersymmetric case,

especially the seiberg-witten theory[13].
