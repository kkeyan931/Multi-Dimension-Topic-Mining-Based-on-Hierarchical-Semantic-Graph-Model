abstract

marchesini showed that the fokkerplanck hamiltonian for yang-mills the-
ories is the loop operator. jevicki and rodrigues showed that the fokker
planck hamiltonian of some matrix models concides with temporal gauge
non-critical string eld theory hamiltonians constructed by ishibashi and
kawai (and their collaborators). thus the loop operator for yangmills the-
ory is the temporal gauge hamiltonian for a noncritical string eld theory, in
accord with polyakovs conjecture. the consistency condition of the string
interpretation is the zigzag symmetry emphasized by polyakov. several as-
pects of the noncritical string theory are considered, relating the string eld
theory hamiltonian to the worldsheet description.

mandelstam [1] realized the importance of gauge invariant loop observables in yangmills
theory. see also [2]. the fact that a string interpretation for yangmills theories is natural
is particularly transparent in the loop equation derived by guerra and collaborators [3],
and rediscovered in [4]. this schwingerdyson equation governs the dynamics of gauge
invariant wilson loops in yangmills theory. there are simple geometric interpretations for
the various terms that appear in terms of string propagation and interactions, with the string
joining interaction suppressed by a factor of 1/n 2 relative to the string splitting interaction
in a normalization natural for the large n limit.

the loop equation governing wilson loop expectation values in gauge theories can be
written as the expectation value of the action of an operator, the loop operator, acting on
wilson lines. it is a fundamental observation due to marchesini [5] that the loop operator
concides with the fokkerplanck hamiltonian that appears in the stochastic quantization
[6] of the gauge theory. as such, the loop operator plays a central role in gauge theories but
its signicance in, for example, a string eld theory equivalent to a yangmills theory has
not been elucidated. the contribution of this paper is to point out that the loop operator
is precisely the temporal gauge string eld theory hamiltonian. i show that the consistency
condition for this identication is polyakovs zigzag symmetry. i explain how the peculiar
asymmetry between joining and splitting vertices can be accounted for in a worldsheet de-
scription, and i explain how recent conjectures on yangmills theories and their dimensional
reductions [79] are related to the explicit identication given here.

the explicit connection given in this paper between string theories and gauge theories
should be compared to the eorts that have gone into attempted constructions of worldsheet
descriptions of rstquantized string propagation in supergravity backgrounds [12] believed
to be dual to gauge theories. the conceptual simplicity of the string eld theory hamiltonian

1

is striking because in no other instance in string theory is a string eld theory simpler or easier
to construct than the rstquantized string theory. the identication of this hamiltonian
can be used to deduce properties of a worldsheet rstquantized description, as i shall
show below. it is plausible that the rstquantized description will capture only part of the
physics incorporated in the exact string eld theory hamiltonian, just as an expansion in
feynman diagrams misses nonperturbative physics.

concretely, the string eld theory that arises from the yangmills theory is a noncritical
string theory. the spacetime dimension in which the string propagate is therefore one
more than the sum of the number of adjoint scalars and the number of gauge potential
components. thus, e.g.
for the d = 4 maximally supersymmetric yangmills theory, the
spacetime dimension of the noncritical string theory is 11, which diers from the nave
interpretation of the maldacena conjecture [8]. however the present construction precisely
agrees with the conjectured qcd string in polyakovs approach [7] which has been argued
on physical grounds to be a noncritical string living in ve dimensions. since the innite
n maldacena conjecture is supported by several precise comparisons with iib supergravity
in ten dimensions, it is important to explain how a noncritical string theory can maintain
this agreement. i explain this below by recalling the dierence between noncritical string
measures and critical string measures following [10,11]. furthermore, comparing to the
calculation of dorey, hollowood, khoze, mattis and vandoren [13], it is interesting to observe
that at nite n the instanton calculation does not localize on s5 but rather seems to involve
an 11dimensional space [14]. (the connection to the noncritical string given in a previous
version of this paper was not mentioned in [14].)

the loop operator is easiest understood in the lattice theory since a precise interpretation
requires a cutothis cuto is not necessarily the same as the cuto used in dening the
quantum gauge theory [15]. dene the loop function for a u(n) gauge theory on a d
dimensional lattice

where c is a closed contour on the lattice, and u(c) is the path ordered product of link
variables along this contour u1(x1)u2(x2) . . . un(xn). dene an electric eld operator ap-
propriate for a d + 1dimensional theory [5]:

where ,  = 1, . . . d, and a = 1, . . . n 2, with trt at b = n/2. for any lattice action, s(u),

while h is not hermitian, by a similarity transformation we can make it hermitian.

there are simple geometric interpretations for the terms that appear in h, which are

clearer when we write

the rst term, which is independent of the lattice action, includes terms that correspond to
the splitting and joining of strings, with the latter term suppressed relative to the former by
a factor of n 2. the equilibrium condition for the stochastic eld theory correlation function
turns out to be the loop equation [5]:

< hw (c) >= 0.

(5)

independently, jevicki and sakita [16] showed that the large n saddle point equation of
yangmills theory formulated as a collective eld theory is equivalent to the loop equation,
as well.

the asymmetry in the powers of n for joining and splitting interactions is a clue for the
string eld theory interpretation since in temporal gauge one does nd such an asymmetry
between string splitting and string joining vertices [17]. this reassignment of powers of n
is consistent with the usual topological loop counting of string diagrams. the sdependent
term has operators corresponding to the motion in the space of loops, and tadpole opera-
tors that annihilate loops. thinking of s as dening the background conguration of the
space of loops, the propagation and annihilation of loops is background dependent, but the
interactions of loops are background independent. notice that the t hooft coupling g2
ymn
appears only in this term. this is essentially another realization of an idea of horowitz,
lykken, rohm and strominger [18] regarding string eld theory. in the large n limit there
are no terms that can join strings. thus in the large n limit, h acts as a derivation on
products qi w (ci).
in a beautiful set of papers, ishibashi, kawai, and collaborators [17,19,20] have con-
structed non-critical string eld theories in temporal gauge. as an example, consider their
string eld theory hamiltonian for the c = 0 model:

hik = z 

0

dl1dl2

l1

l2l1+l2(l1 + l2) + z 

0

dl(l)l + o(g2)

where l annihilates a string of length l, and hl, 

li = (l  l). the term of o(g2) is

g2 z 

0

dl1dl2

l1+l2l2l1l1l2

(7)

and describes the merging of strings.  annihilates unmarked loops and  creates marked
loops. the string joining and string splitting terms have dierent powers of g, just as there
are dierent powers of n 1 in the loop joining and splitting terms in the loop operator. this
hamiltonian was rst written down for the c = 1 model by das and jevicki [21] and it was
pointed out subsequently by moore, seiberg and staudacher [22] that it applied as well to
c < 1 models with changes in the tadpole term.

a connected amplitude with b boundaries and h handles comes with a factor g2h2+2b,
which is not the usual topological combination. (i have corrected a small error in [20] here.)
this can be traced to the fact that the disk amplitude is non-zero and has a factor g0
in this formalism. normalizing connected amplitudes with respect to the conventionally
normalized disk amplitudes gives the usual euler characteristic power g(22hb). in the
temporal gauge interpretation, the tadpole term is o(1), just as for large n yangmills
theory the normalized expectation value is o(1). one could rescale  and  while preserving

3

the commutation relation to make the joining and the splitting terms of the same order in g,
but this would change the normalization of the tadpole term as well, making the expectation
value of a wilson loop o(n), appropriate for a string disk amplitude. this is not, however,
natural from the point of view of the gauge theory, so i will give below another geometric
interpretation of the powers of g.

jevicki and rodrigues [23] showed that the hamiltonian hik (including the o(g2) term)
arises naturally as the doublescaling limit [24] of the k = 2 matrix model fokkerplanck
hamiltonian. thus one has a direct map from matrix models to noncritical string eld
theories in the temporal gauge, via the fokkerplanck hamiltonian.

crucial to the string interpretation of the fokkerplanck hamiltonian is a consistency
check, equivalent to dieomorphism invariance on the string worldsheet [20,23]. in the case
of the loop operator, it is a generalization of the derivation given in [20](sect. 3) that the
consistency of the string interpretation is equivalent to the zigzag symmetry of wilson loops,
particularly emphasized by polyakov [7]. the key point to note here is that two wilson loops
li, i = 1, 2 (which are the strings in this formalism) may join either by an innitesimal loop
attaching to l1 leading to contact with l2 or vice versa. for the string interpretation,
dieomorphism invariance on the worldsheet implies that the dierence between these two
amplitudes should vanish. subtracting the amplitudes for the two processes, we encounter
amplitudes involving insertions of innitesimal backtracking loops, which are trivial if and
only if the zigzag symmetry holds.

in connection with the zigzag symmetry, a recent investigation of the loop equation
[9] in the ades/cft correspondence [25] has found that the agreement between gauge
theory expectations and critical string expectations is regularization dependent. recalling
the analysis of polyakov [7] and klebanov, kogan and polyakov [11] suggests then that the
zigzag symmetry requires the noncritical liouville dimension to be taken into account.

thus we reach the main conclusion of this paper: the loop operator of yangmills theory
is the temporal gauge string eld theory hamiltonian of a noncritical string theory, provided
that the zigzag symmetry is maintained.

this observation suggests that the appropriate place to look for a worldsheet description
of the yangmills string is temporal gauge [19]. this gauge is quite dierent from conformal
gauge so much of the usual intuition for rstquantized string theory requires revision. for
example, in lightcone string eld theory, for example, string splitting and joining interac-
tion vertices are given by mirror image worldsheets, with curvature singularities precisely at
the joining/splitting point. these curvature singularities are integrable and precisely lead
to the expected power of g for both string joining and splitting vertices, since the spacetime
dilaton  couples to r (2)r. the incoming and outgoing strings lie on curves with vanishing
geodesic curvature in lightcone string eld theory. in temporal gauge, as mentioned above,
the splitting and joining interactions come with dierent powers of g. since the euler char-
acteristic of the pants diagram is e = 1, how can this be? a simple resolution of this
puzzle is to note that only the worldsheet bulk curvature couples to the dilaton, whereas
the euler characteristic is a sum of two terms

z (2)r + xboundaries

ici

 = 2e

(8)

according to gauss and bonnet [26], with  the geodesic curvature of the boundary compo-
nents. there is a time asymmetry in the denition of temporal gauge, so we can sensibly

4

distinguish between incoming and outgoing strings. let h  = 2k for standard outgo-
ing/incoming loops respectively, then for the joining vertex we have

1

2 z (2)r = 2 = e(pants)  k+  2k

and for the splitting vertex we have

1

2 z (2)r = 0 = e(pants)  2k+  k .

we nd then

k+ = k = 1.

(9)

(10)

(11)

this is precisely as it must be since in the standard gluing of worldsheet diagrams in string
eld theory, the geodesic curvatures of boundaries being identied must cancel for construct-
ing smooth surfaces. as an independent check this predicts that the tadpole diagram (a disk)
will have one incoming string giving a contribution k = +1 to the euler characteristic and
therefore have vanishing integrated bulk curvature,

e(disk)  k = +1  1 = 0 =

1

2 z (2)r

(12)

implying that the tadpole will be o(1), which is exactly correct. as another consistency
check, the euler characteristic of the cylinder is zero,thus incoming and outgoing boundaries
must have boundary geodesic curvature that diers only in sign since the propagation term
in the loop operator has no factors of n and therefore corresponds to a vanishing bulk
contribution. the fact that there is nonvanishing geodesic curvature associated with the
boundaries in this gauge is related to the fact that the wilson loops are normalized with
factors of 1/n.

the discussion trivially extends to dimensionally reduced and/or supersymmetric [27]

gauge theories, with a(x(s))dx/ds replaced by i(x(s))pn vi(s  sn) in the pathordered

exponential for dimensionally reduced directions. this is of interest in light of the conjec-
tures of banks, fischler, shenker and susskind [28], and maldacena [8], though it needs to
emphasized again that these conjectures are associated with critical string theories.

in polyakovs attempts at constructing string theories equivalent to yangmills theory, on
the other hand, the strings that appear are noncritical strings [7]. as such, the identication
which has been proposed in this paper is exactly in line with his work, especially noting the
zigzag symmetrys role in a string interpretation.

the string eld theory that i have identied in this paper is gaugexed. this is related
to the fact that we have worked entirely in terms of gaugeinvariant operations on gauge
invariant wilson loops. recollect that residual spacetime gauge transformations in critical
string theory appear as conformal transformations on the worldsheet in conformal gauge.

since i have given here a construction of a noncritical string theory from yangmills
theory that is dierent from the standard conjectures [9], i must explain how the numer-
ous agreements supporting the standard conjectures that appear at string treelevel come
about. this is easily done: what is the dierence between a critical string amplitude and
a noncritical string amplitude? the functional measure for a critical string amplitude has

5

an integration over the conformal mode and a division by the volume of the group of con-
formal transformations, vol(conf). these cancel for correlation functions of onshell vertex
operators, and do not cancel if we consider oshell amplitudes [10]. even for oshell
amplitudes, on the sphere, there are no moduli and vol(conf) is a amplitude independent
constant. on higher genus surfaces, vol(conf) depends on the moduli and cannot be factored
out. for noncritical strings, there is still an integration over the conformal mode, but no
corresponding division by vol(conf). thus, if we are interested in tree amplitudes, we can
extract critical string tree amplitudes from a subset of the noncritical string tree amplitudes.
(recall that string tree amplitudes do not suce to reconstruct string loop amplitudes [29].)
this subset corresponds to onshell string states that have no dependence on the conformal
mode. from the fokkerplanck perspective, it is natural to focus on correlations

lim
d

h0| exp(dh)y w (ci)|0i

(13)

where d is the fokkerplanck time (the liouville dimension coordinate), here identied with
the worldsheet time coordinate, of wilson loops ci that satisfy the equilibrium condition

[h, w (ci)] = 0 for each i.

(14)

it seems clear that correlations of observables satisfying the equilibrium condition will cor-
respond to amplitudes with truncated external leg propagators, natural for onshell vertex
operators in critical string theory. however, the precise relation between these two sets of
objects remains to be computed.

lastly, i mention that supporting evidence for my identication comes from a very re-
cent preprint by lidsey [30].
in this work it is shown that the critical iib supergravity
backgrounds can be embedded in elevendimensional ricciat spaces,
including back-
grounds with nontrivial ramondramond elds. this is precisely in accord with the
abovementioned relation between critical strings and noncritical strings at tree level, see
especially klebanov, kogan and polyakov [11].
