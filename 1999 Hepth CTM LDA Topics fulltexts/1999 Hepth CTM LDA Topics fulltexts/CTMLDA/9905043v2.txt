we calculate one-loop 2-point tachyon amplitudes in unoriented open-closed string eld
theory, and determine all the coupling constants of the interaction vertices in the theory. it is
shown that the planar, nonplanar and nonorientable amplitudes are all reproduced correctly,
and nontrivial consistencies between the determined coupling constants are observed. the
necessity for the gauge group to be so(213=8192) is also reconrmed.

introduction

in previous two papers, 1), 2) which we refer to as i and ii, we constructed a string
eld theory (sft) for an unoriented open-closed string mixed system and proved the
brs/gauge invariance of the action at the tree level: namely, we have classied the
terms in the brs transform of the action into two categories, tree terms and loop
terms and have shown that all the tree terms indeed cancel themselves. and for
the other loop terms, we have identied which anomalous one-loop diagrams they
are expected to cancel.

it was left for a future work to show that those loop diagrams are indeed anoma-
lous and the loop terms really cancel them. however, the task to show this brs
invariance for general one-loop diagrams is technically rather hard and we have not
yet completed it. here in this paper, we address ourselves to an easier problem to
compute the one-loop 2-point (open-string) tachyon amplitudes in our sft. these
one-loop amplitudes already suer from a brs anomaly and so the present calcula-
tion gives partially an armative answer to the above expected cancellation between
the loop terms and the one-loop anomaly. moreover with this computation we shall
conrm that the one-loop tachyon amplitudes are correctly reproduced in our sft
and can determine all the remaining coupling constants left undetermined in the
previous work; in particular, we show that the gauge group must be so(213=8192).
the action of the present system, containing seven interaction terms, is given by

where x4, x, xc, x, xu and x are coupling constants (relative to the open 3-string
coupling constant g). for notation and conventions, we follow our previous papers
i and ii. the open and closed string elds are denoted by |i and |i, respectively,
both of which are grassmann odd. the multiple products of string elds are denoted
for brevity as |in21  |in  |i2 |i1. the brs charges qb with tilde here,
introduced in i, are given by the usual brs charges qb plus counterterms for the
zero intercept proportional to the squared string length parameter 2:

the ghost zero-modes for the closed string are dened by c+
c0  c0, and b+
the string elds are always accompanied by the unoriented projection opera-
tor , which is given by using the twist operator  in the form  = (1 + )/2,
where  for the open string case means also taking transposition of the matrix
index. the closed string is further accompanied by the projection operator p 
r 2
0 (d/2) exp i(l0  l0), projecting out the l0  l0 = 0 modes, and the corre-
sponding anti-ghost zero-mode factor b0 = (b0  b0)/2.

vertex u and open-string self-intersection vertex v are relevant in this paper and
have the following form: 2)

the vertices here denoted by lower case letters are those constructed by the procedure
of leclair, peskin and preitschopf (lpp). 3) the br (r = 1, 2) are anti-ghost factors
4), 5), 6) corresponding to the moduli r representing the two interaction points in the
intersection vertex v. those lpp vertices generally have the structure

(1.4)

where rhpr| is the fock bra vacuum of string r with momentum eigenvalue pr and the
exponent e() is a quadratic form of string oscillators with neumann coecients
determined by the way of gluing the participating strings. a point to be noted
here is that since the gluing way depends on the set of the string lengths r and,
in our  = p+ hikko type theory, 7) the string length r is identied with the +

component of string momentum p

closed string, the exponent function e() has a nontrivial dependence on rs. note

p in eq. (1.4) is quite nontrivial.

in the previous papers, we have shown that the theory is brs (and hence gauge)

invariant at tree level if the coupling constants satisfy the relations

(1.5)

(1.6)
(1.7)
(1.8)

where the sign of x has been changed from the previous papers i and ii since we
change the sign convention for the v vertex in this paper by the reason as will be
made clear in 5. these relations (1.5)  (1.8) leave only two parameters free, e.g.,
xu and n, or xu and x. we shall determine all the three parameters xu, x and n,
thus giving a nontrivial consistency check of the theory.
the rest of this paper is organized as follows. first in 2, we show which di-
agrams contribute to the on-shell tachyon 2-point amplitude at one-loop level by
using feynman rule in the present sft. to evaluate the amplitudes of those dia-
grams explicitly we need to conformally map those diagrams into the torus plane and
to compute the conformal eld theory (cft) correlation functions on the torus. we
present in 3 such conformal mapping for each diagram explicitly, and calculate in 4
the jacobians for the changes of moduli parameters associated with the mappings.
in 5 we rst give some discussions on the generalized gluing and resmoothing the-
orem (ggrt) 3), 8) to x the normalizations of cft correlation functions on the
torus, and then evaluate the necessary correlation functions explicitly. gathering
those results in 3 - 5, we nally evaluate the tachyon amplitude explicitly in 6,
where the coupling constants xu and x and n of the gauge group so(n) are also
determined. finally in 7, we conclude and present some discussions on the relations
between the brs anomaly in the present sft and the lorentz invariance anomaly
in the light-cone gauge sft. 9), 10), 11)

for the variables and functions appearing in the one-loop amplitudes, we use the
same notations as much as possible as those in chapter 8 of the textbook by green,
schwarz and witten (gsw). 12) we cite in appendix some modular transformation
relations between such one-loop functions which will be used in the text.

this product of projection operators yields four terms,  (d) (f ) = ( 1 + (d) +
(f ) + (d)(f ) )/4, and accordingly the glued vertex h v (1, 2; 1, 2)| contains four
dierent congurations as drawn in fig. 1, which we call planar (p), nonorientable
(or mobius) (m1 and m2) and nonplanar (np) diagrams, respectively. to those the
following four lpp vertices correspond:

h v (1,2; 1,2)| =

(2.5)

where the factor n in front of hvp| has come from the inner endpoint loop carrying
chan-paton index in the planar diagram.

we take the external open string states to be on-shell tachyon states

|ir = |0(kr)i r =hc(wr) eikrx(r)(wr)iwr=0 |0ir

(cid:16)k2
r = 2(cid:17) .

(2.6)

then, the one-loop eective action (2.1) with eq. (2.5) substituted, yields the fol-
lowing one-loop 2-point tachyon amplitudes

{ap + am1 + am2 + anp } k1+k2
) note that the factor il is multiplied to the l-loop level eective action in the present
feynman rule where the factors i1 and i are omitted from the propagators and the vertices,
respectively.

here we note two points. first, the rhs is generally multiplied by a factor

r

dwr(cid:19) k2
yr=1,2(cid:18) du

2 1

u=zr

(2.9)

which is associated with the conformal mapping of the operators c(wr)eikrx(wr)
from the unit disk wr to the torus u plane and zr = u(wr=0) are the positions of
punctures on the torus representing the external strings. but here the factor (2.9) is
1 since the conformal weights (k2
r /2) 1 are zero for the on-shell tachyons. secondly,
this eq. (2.8) determines the cft correlation functions on the rhs including their
signs and weights. this constitutes the content of ggrt; 8), 13) namely, the loop
level lpp vertex hvj| with j = p, no (m1 and m2), np are already dened above
3| by eq. (2.4) with (2.5). so
as glued vertices of the two tree level lpp vertices hvo
these torus correlation functions are already xed including their coecients. we
defer the explicit evaluation of these correlation functions until 5.
here we rst consider the nonplanar diagram np, for which the two intermediate
strings are both twisted. the amplitude anp corresponding to this diagram alone
does not give the full nonplanar amplitude correctly. indeed, this can easily be seen
if we redraw the diagram np in the form as depicted in the diagram (a) in fig. 2. so
it can cover only the 1 > 0 part of the full nonplanar amplitude, and the remaining

and the following glued lpp vertex has been dened:

hvu u (1, 1)| = hu(1, ac)| hu(2, bc)| e(l0+ l0)1ei1(l0 l0) |rc(ac, bc)i . (2.12)

again the amplitude is evaluated by referring to the cft on the torus:

hvu u (1, 1)| b0b0 |0(k2)i 2 |0(k1)i 1 =d b0b0 c(z2)eik2x(z2)c(z1)eik1x(z1)eu u
the amplitudes anp in eq. (2.7) and au u in eq. (2.10) should smoothly connect
with each other at 1 = 0 to reproduce the correct nonplanar amplitude, and this
condition will determine the coupling constant xu, as we shall obtain later.

(2.13)

.

next consider the two nonorientable diagrams, m1 and m2 terms in fig. 1. these
two diagrams alone do not give the full nonorientable amplitude, again. indeed, the
two diagrams do not connect with each other at the moduli 1 = 0, so that another
diagram should exist which interconnects these two congurations at 1 = 0. such a
diagram is just given by the tree diagram drawn in fig. 3 which is obtained by using
the v vertex. clearly the conguration of this diagram coincides at 2 = 1 (and
1 = f ) with that of the m1 diagram at 1 = 0, and at 1 = 0 (and 2 = f )
with that of the m2 diagram at 1 = 0. the amplitude av of this diagram is
proportional to x, and so the smooth connection condition for these amplitudes

.

(2.14)

finally, we note that the planar diagram in fig. 1 as 1  0 and the above
diagram of v vertex as 1  2  0, both have singularities owing to the closed
tachyon and dilaton vanishing into vacuum. as is shown in fig. 4, this is almost
the same situation as what we have encountered in the disk and rp 2 amplitudes for
closed tachyon 2-point function in the previous paper i. the former planar ampli-
tude is proportional to ng2 and the latter v amplitude to x. the condition for
the dilaton contributions to cancel between the two amplitudes will determine n of
so(n), as we shall explicitly see later.

3. conformal mapping of  plane to torus

in order to calculate these amplitudes in eqs. (2.7), (2.10) and (2.14), we need
conformal mapping of the usual unit disk |wr|  1 of participating string r to the
torus for each case. the string world sheets of the light-cone type diagrams like

8

t. asakawa, t. kugo and t. takahashi

figs. 1, 2 etc, are called  plane, on which the complex coordinate  =  + i is
identied with  = rr + ir (r: a real constant) in each string r strip (rer  0),
where r = r + ir is the image of the unit disk |wr|  1 of string r by a simple
(conformal) mapping r = ln wr. therefore we have only to know the conformal
mapping of the  plane to the torus for each case.

the conformal mapping of the  plane to the torus u plane with periods 1 and
 is generically given by the following (generalized) mandelstam mapping: 15), 12), 16)

(u) = xr=1,2

r ln 1(u  zr| ) + au

(3.1)

where i(| ) (i = 1, , 4) are jacobi  functions with periods 1 and  . this 
satises a quasi-periodicity

(u + m + n)  (u) = 2im xr=1,2

rzr + a(m + n).

(3.2)

the derivative d/du is truly a doubly periodic function, or elliptic function, 17)
which is analytic except for the poles at u = zr (r = 1, 2):

d
du

= xr=1,2

rg1(u  zr| ) + a,

where gi is the logarithmic derivative of the jacobi  function:
i(| )

,

gi(| ) 

i(| )
i(| )

i(| ) 

.



(3.3)

(3.4)

zr corresponds to the image of the external string r at r =  (wr = 0). two
interaction points z(i)
0

(i = 1, 2) are given by the zeros of this function:

d
du

(z(i)

0 ) = 0  xr=1,2

rg1(z(i)

0  zr| ) + a = 0.

by a general property of elliptic functions, 17) a sum rule holds:

z1 + z2 = z(1)

0 + z(2)

0

(mod periods 1 and  )

(3.5)

(3.6)

we now examine the conformal mappings for the cases of planar, nonorientable,
nonplanar, v and u u diagrams, separately, and will nd relations which determine
the torus moduli  , the parameter a and interaction points z(i)
in terms of the string
0
length and the moduli parameters of the  plane.

3.1. planar diagram (p)

the mapping for the planar diagram case is drawn in fig. 5. in this case the
period  is purely imaginary and denoted by  , and the mapping of this fig. 5 is given
by the above mandelstam mapping (3.1) with  replaced by  . the interaction points
(i)
in the u plane. by using the shift invariance on

fig. 5. conformal mapping of planar diagram  plane to a torus u plane. in the  plane, the edge
curve a-b of string e is identied with the curve a-b of string f , which are mapped to the
bottom and top lines a-b and a-b on the u plane, respectively.

the torus plane and the sum rule (3.6), we can parametrize the positions of strings
(punctures) and interaction points by two real parameters x and y as

z1 = (cid:16) 1
z2 = (cid:16) 1

(3.7)

by the help of the periodicity (3.2), we can determine the parameters a and
0 and then

0 , for instance, we have u = z(i)

x as follows. first, taking u + 1 = z(i)
(u + 1) = (i)
, so that

0 and (u) = (i)0
(u + 1)  (u) = a = (i)

0  (i)0 = 2if  a = 2if .

(3.8)

next, note that the bottom line imu = 0 and the top line imu = || with 0  reu 
1/2, are mapped to the wavy curves a-b and a-b of strings e and f on the  plane
in fig. 5. therefore we have

the eq. (3.5) determining the interaction points, or y, now reads

g2( (x + y)| ) + g2( (x  y)| ) = 2i

which is identical with the extremum condition 1/y = 0 of 1 in eq. (3.10).

the curve a-b is identied with the curve a-b, whose images in the u plane are also shown.

3.2. nonorientable diagrams (m1 and m2)

the mapping of the nonorientable diagram m1 to torus is drawn in fig. 6. in
this case the fundamental region of the torus is given as indicated in the same gure
fig. 6, and so the period  is now given by  + 1/2. accordingly, the mapping of
this fig. 6 is given by the above mandelstam mapping (3.1) with  =  + 1/2. we
can parametrize the positions of strings (punctures) and interaction points by the
same equations as eq. (3.7) in this case also.

similarly to the previous planar case, the periodicity (3.2) determines the pa-

rameters a and x; from the period 1 we have the same relation as before,

a = 2if .

(3.12)

noting that two points separated by  + 1/2, e.g., the points a and a, on the u plane
correspond to those separated by 1  2 + if on the  plane as seen in fig. 6,
and using the period  + 1

2 of (u), we obtain

1  2 + if = = (u + ( + 1

2 ))  (u) = 2i1(z1  z2) + a( + 1

mapping (3.1) with  =  . however, the strings (punctures) and interaction points
are placed dierently from the planar case as shown in fig. 7. so we parametrize
their positions by real parameters x and y as

in the explicit computation of the amplitudes below, we will need to make change
of the variables from the moduli parameters on the  plane to the torus moduli

the diagrams.

(4.6)

in the present case of tachyon amplitude, we shall see below that the amplitudes
for p, no (m1 and m2) and np diagrams contain delta function factor (1  2)
(which is always the case when the external string states have no excitations of n
modes (see 7)). then, as seen in eqs. (3.9), (3.13) and (3.18) in those cases of p,
no (m1 and m2) and np diagrams, 1 = 2 means

a = 2if = 4i1x ,

(4.7)

the same expression as eqs. (3.23) and (3.29) for the v and u u amplitude cases.
thus, for all amplitude cases, we have

 2i

(z1  z2)



= 4ix =

a
1

,

(4.8)

which together with eq.(3.5) implies that the part enclosed by a curly bracket in
eq. (4.6) vanishes. consequently we obtain

5. cft correlation functions on the torus

5.1. correlation functions and ggrt

to compute the cft correlation functions on the torus, we further map the
u plane to the  = 2iu plane such that the  =  + i plane becomes of the
usual open string strip with im (=) = 0 and  being the open string boundaries
and, therefore, the usual fourier expansion () =pn nen can be used there for

the string coordinate and ghost elds  = x, b and c. then, the cft correlation
functions can be calculated by the following formulas:
for the cases of p and np
diagrams with period  ,

(5.1)

2

and for the no (m1 and m2) cases with period  + 1
2 ,

= (2i)prdr trh()nfp+1 w(l0c/24) yr or(2iur)i,
dyr or(ur)e
= (2i)prdr trh()nfp+1w(l0c/24)yr or(2iur)i, (5.2)
dyr or(ur)e + 1
where w  e2i , nfp is the ghost number operator (whose explicit expression is
given shortly), c is the central charge of the system, and  is the (open string) twist
operator,  : u  u + 1
2 (    i). here we have assumed that the operators
or are primary elds with conformal weights dr, as being always the case in our
computations below.
as noted before, these formulas are not mere denitions of the torus cft cor-
relation functions but the result of the ggrt 13) for the cases of p, np and no
diagrams. actually, once the period is specied, the functional form of the torus
correlation function is unique but the overall normalization factor is not. ggrt
determines those normalization factors also.

for the remaining u u and v cases, these formula does not give the correct
normalization factor. first consider the u u diagram case, in which the hvu u| vertex
is given in eq. (2.12) by contracting two tree level u vertices by closed reector
|rc(ac, bc)i. in view of the u plane in fig. 9 in which the vertical lines represent the
intermediate closed string, we note that the direction of the time evolution on the u
plane is not vertical but horizontal in the u u diagram case. so the trace operation
should be taken in the horizontal direction in this u u diagram case, and the correct
mapping from the u plane to  plane should be  = 2u(i/ )+const. such that the
image of the vertical line reu = const., 0  imu  || (=  /i) has the correct width
2 in  = im. using this mapping and denoting 1/   , the correct formula in
this u u case reads

= (2i )prdr trh()nfp+1 q2(l0c/24)yr or(2i ur)i,
dyr or(ur)eu u,
where q  ei , and tr means that no trace is taken over the momentum; the trace
tr0[] in the zero mode sector of x is simply hk1/2|  |k1/2i where k1 is the
momentum of the external string 1. we emphasize again that the dierence between

(5.3)

18

t. asakawa, t. kugo and t. takahashi

the cft correlation functions (5.1) and (5.3) computed vertically and horizontally,
respectively, in fact appears only in their numerical coecients and their function
forms are exactly the same.

for completeness, we present here the proof for this formula (5.3). it can be
proven by using the ggrt for the case of open-string loop diagram. 13) the closed
string ac can be treated essentially as a product of two open strings a and a,
corresponding to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic pieces. this identication
is, however, slightly violated in the zero-mode sector of x, since there exists only a
single zero-mode x (or p) common to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts.
to make the identication exact, we can extend the zero mode sector such that both
the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors have their own zero modes p and p,
and identify the original state |p1i to be |p, pi with p + p = p1 and p  p = 0. then,
taking account of dp dp = d(p + p) d((p  p)/2), we can identify the closed reector
|rc(ac, bc)i as

(5.4)

|rc(ac, bc)i = (2)dd(cid:16) pa  p a

2

(cid:17)|ro(a, b)i(cid:12)(cid:12)ro( a, b)(cid:11)

and the vertex hu(1, ac)| , for instance, becomes to have momentum conservation
factor d(pa + pa + k1) instead of d(pa + k1). with this device, we now apply the
ggrt 8), 13) for the open string case to the present u u vertex contracted by the
closed string reector: with 1  1 + i1,
hvu u (1, 1)|
= hu(1, ac)| hu(2, bc)| el01e l0 1 |rc(ac, bc)i
= hu( a, 1, a)| el01 hu(b, 2, b)| e l0 1(2)dd(cid:16) pa  p a
= hu( a, 1, a)| el01 hu(b, 2, b)| |ro(a, b)i e l0 1(2)dd(cid:16)p a +
= hv( a, 1, 2, b)| e l0 1(2)dd(cid:16)p a +
2(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)ro( a, b)(cid:11) ,
where we have used the momentum conservation hu( a, 1, a)| (pa + p a + k1) =

tities are now of open-string, we can apply the loop level ggrt proven in ref. 13)

note that the bra and ket zero-mode states here correspond to the open strings of
anti-holomorphic parts b and a, respectively. therefore this expression corresponds

one-loop tachyon amplitude

19

to the cutting of the torus on the u plane as indicated by bold line in fig. 9, and
also shows that the time evolution direction is horizontal as claimed above.

finally, consider the v case. actually we have not given a precise denition of
the hv| vertex in the preceding papers i and ii, since it refers to cft on the torus.
nevertheless, we have used in i the ggrt that the two glued vertices

hv1(1, 4c; 0, ,  )|  hu(1, 2c)| hv(3c, 4c; 0)| e (l+ l)ei(l l) |rc(2c, 3c)i ,
(5.7)
hv2(1, 4c; 1, 2,  )|  hv(1, 2; 1, 2)| hu(3, 4c)| e l |ro(2, 3)i ,

become identical at  = 0. since hv| and hu| are already dened, this identity xes
the normalization of the hv| vertex. the minus sign in the expression of hv2| here
is because the contraction was taken by |ro(3, 2)i = |ro(2, 3)i in i. however, the
contraction by |ro(2, 3)i is more natural in the sign from the ggrt view point,
so we here require that hv1(1, 4c; 0, ,  )| = hv2(1, 4c; 1, 2,  )| holds at  = 0 by
changing the sign convention of the hv| vertex and hence of the coupling constant
xu from i and ii. in order for this identity to hold, the hv| vertex should be dened
indeed the rst
by referring to the horizontal computation as in the u u case.
glued vertex hv1| is given by contraction using the closed string reector |rc(2c, 3c)i
which contains the delta function constraining the intermediate state momentum as
in eq. (5.4). to perform horizontal calculation, we note that the vertical period
 + 1/2 is equivalent to the horizontal period

which corresponds to taking the torus fundamental region to be the region enclosed
by the dotted bold line in fig. 8, and the fundamental region on the u plane is
mapped to -plane by  = 2iu/2 + const. = i u + const. such that the image
of the vertical line reu = y, || /2  imu  3|| /2 has the correct width 2 in
 = im. using this mapping, the correct formula for dening the v vertex is:

where q  ei , and h0|  |0i means that the expectation value is taken with mo-
if we have adopted the vertical
mentum 0 state in the zero mode sector of x.
denition (5.2) for this case also, the weight would be dierent by an intriguing

let us now evaluate the ghost and x parts, separately.

5.2. ghost part

as is seen in eqs. (2.8), (2.13) and (2.14), the correlation functions we need in

this paper have the following form as their ghost parts:

(5.11)

first consider the planar and nonplanar diagram cases with period  , to which
the formula (5.1) applies. substituting into it the expansion of the ghost elds on
the  = 2iu plane

c() =xn

cnen,

b() =xn

bnen,

(5.12)

we evaluate the ghost correlation function as follows:)

nfp = c0b0 +xn1
0 = xn1

(5.14)

the trace tr can be calculated mode by mode, tr = tr0 qn=1 trn. noting, in
particular, the zero-mode part trace formula tr0[()nfp b0c0] =  tr0[()nfpc0b0] =
1 and tr0[()nfp 1] = tr0[()nfp c0] = tr0[()nfp b0] = 0, as explained in ref. 13),
we obtain

are rearranged in the order of time in the rst equation here.

next we consider the nonorientable diagram case with period  + 1/2, to which

and its eect can simply be taken into account by making replacements w  w

5.2.3. u u

thirdly we consider the u u diagram case, to which the formula (5.3) applies.
comparing this formula with the previous one (5.1) for p and np cases, we imme-
diately see that we obtain the desired result in this case by making replacements
w  q2, u   u and (2i)2  (2i )2 (for the conformal factor) in the above
rst result (5.16):

hb(u1)b(u2)c(z2)c(z1)i

= 2i 2h q

12 f (q2)i2ng1( (u1  z1)| )  g1( (u1  z2)| )
g1( (u2  z1)| ) + g1( (u2  z2)| )o.

(5.19)

but, the functions f and g1 have simple transformation properties under the jacobi
imaginary transformation   1/ =  :

h w

24 f (w)i2

= ih q

12 f (q2)i2

,

g1( u| ) =

g1(u| )  2iu.

(5.20)

) note that the fock vacuum |1i  c1 |0i is even under the twist ,  |1i = + |1i, so sl(2; c)

vacuum |0i is odd.

22

t. asakawa, t. kugo and t. takahashi

owing to these, the present correlation function (5.19) in fact turns out to equal the
previous one (5.16) up to an overall factor i:

h b(u1) b(u2) c(z2) c(z1)i = i h b(u1) b(u2) c(z2) c(z1)i .

(5.21)

this reects the modular invariance of the theory, but note that the factor i dierence
remains here contrary to the vacuum energy.
5.2.4. v

final is the v diagram case, to which the formula (5.9) applies. comparison
of this formula with eq. (5.2) for no case shows that the result in this case can be
obtained by making replacements w  q1/2, u  ( /2)u and (2i)2  (i )2 in
the above result (5.18) for no case:

hb(u1)b(u2)c(z2)c(z1)i 
= 2i(cid:18)

(5.24)

5.3. x part

5.3.1. covariant case

in our sft, manifest lorentz covariance is lost by the choice  = (2)p+. how-
ever, the violation occurs only in the zero mode p sector and all the other parts
still retains the manifest covariance. so we rst calculate the x correlation function
in the manifest covariant case, and later will clarify where and how the covariant
result is modied.

what we need calculate is the 2-point x correlation function:

deik2x(z2)eik1x(z1)e
24 ) : eik2x(2) : : eik1x(1) :i ,
where use has been made of the formula (5.1) and r = 2izr (r = 1, 2). on the
 plane, the coordinate elds x  are expanded as

(5.32)

where (, w) is the function dened in eq. (8.a.10) in gsw: 12)

5.3.2. p, np and no cases

let us see where and what modications are necessary in our case of p, np and

no diagrams.

first we should note that, in these cases of p, np and no diagrams, the loop
momentum p in the zero-mode trace calculation tr0[], eq. (5.28), equals the minus
of the momentum of the intermediate open string f , i.e., p = pf ,) and so 2p+ is
just the string length f of the string f . since the conformal mappings to the torus
for those cases depend on f , the f dependence appears everywhere not only in
the zero-momentum trace part, so that the integration over f cannot be performed
in the zero-momentum trace part alone.

) the minus sign is understandable if we note that the contours c and c  giving the zero modes

(dw/2i)x(w) of string f and p = ihc  (d/2i)x() on the  plane, have opposite

directions by the mapping w    u  .

pf = ihc

24

t. asakawa, t. kugo and t. takahashi

the zero-mode part of the trace tr[w(lx

where in going to the last line we have used p|pi = p|pi and exp(ikx)|pi = |p + ki,
and further hp|p + k1 + k2i = (2)dd(k1 + k2) and k2
2 = k1  k2. taking
account of the above remark for the p, np and no diagram cases, we here insert
1 =r df (f + 2p+) and keep ther df integration undone. then

(5.36)

if the f dependence appeared only in this zero-mode sector, then the f integration
of the delta function would trivially give 1 and the expression (5.35) just reproduced
the covariant case answer (5.29), as it should be. therefore, the zero-mode trace in
our case is given by

(5.37)

secondly, note that the open string coordinate x(r) on the original  plane is
usually an abbreviation for the real coordinate (x(r) + x(r))/2, and is, therefore,
mapped to the coordinate (x(r) + x(r))/2 on the nal  = 2iu plane, which
coincides with x(r) if r lies on the real axis. this was actually the case in the p
and no diagram cases both for r = 1 and 2. in the np diagram case, however, 2
does not lie on the real axis, so that we should make a replacement

this change amounts to making a replacement 2  2  i only in the zero mode
part in the above calculation, and hence the replacement of (, w) by

(5.40)

the  function factor in eq. (5.37) is also modied by this shift 2  2  i. but,
thanks to this change, 1  2 = 2i(z1  z2) becomes 4i x in coincidence with
the p and no cases. (compare eqs. (3.7) and (3.16).) therefore, the  function
factor in eq. (5.37) can be rewritten uniformly in the three cases, p, no and np,
into

(cid:16)f 

1  2
ln w

1(cid:17)  (cid:18) 1  2

ln w (cid:19) = ( ln w)(1  2),

(5.41)

where use has been made of ln w = 2i < 0 and eqs. (3.9), (3.13) and (3.18).

finally, for the case of no diagram where the period is  + 1/2, we should
include the twist operator . since n1 = ()nn, the whole eect is simply
to make a replacement w  w in the non-zero mode sector in eq. (5.31); that is,

the relation (a.5),

the correlation function for v case is also calculated similarly to the u u case.
by the formula (5.9) for this case, the zero-mode part trace tr0[] is the expectation

in going to the last expressions, the explicit forms (5.45) for fs and eqs. (5.19)
and (5.18) for gs, are used together with the on-shell condition k1  k2 = 2 and
relations w = e2i , 12 = e4i x.

6.2. full nonplanar amplitude and u u diagram

the nonplanar amplitude anp in eq. (6.7) gives a correct nonplanar on-shell
tachyon amplitude 12) if it covers the full integration region 0   /i <  and 0 
2x(= )  1. however, the diagram in fig. 7 does not cover the full region. the
integration over x is all right since eq. (3.18) with 1  2 = 0 implies 2x = f /1
which indeed runs over 0  2x  1 as f runs from 0 to 1. but eq. (3.19) implies
that, as 1 runs from 0 to ,  /i runs from a certain value 0(x)/i(> 0) to , where
0(x) is the root for  of the eq. (3.19) with 1 = 0. so it is necessary to cover the
missing region 0   /i  0(x)/i.
gram contribution (2.10), which we now evaluate explicitly.

as was announced already in 2, this missing region is covered by the u u dia-
the ghost part of the cft correlation function (2.13) is calculated in quite the

same way as in eq. (6.1) by using eq. (5.21) together with (5.16):

in eq. (4.17), which reads d1d1 = i1r1d dx by using r dened in eq. (6.4).
putting these altogether, the u u amplitude (2.10) turns out to be

(6.11)

then the full nonplanar amplitude is reproduced in this sft. the reason of opposite
sign is as follows. originally, the variable 1 runs from 0 to 21 and 1 from 0 to
, which are mapped into the present variables x and  by the relations (3.30) and
(3.31). from those relation we nd the integration region correspondence

namely a minus sign appears since the increasing direction of 1 is opposite to
that of  /i, contrary to the previous np case. this could have been inferred from
the diagrams in fig. 2, and indeed the relations (3.31) and (3.19) between 1 and
 for u u and np cases, respectively, have just opposite signs. thus, with the
u in eq. (6.11), we obtain the correct nonplanar amplitude anp
coupling strength x2
in eq. (6.7) with the full integration region r 0 d( /i)r 1/2
in fig. 12 (a), we
present a schematic view to show how the two diagrams np and uu cover the full
moduli region 0   /i < , 0  x  1/2.
6.3. full nonorientable amplitude and v diagram

in the same way, the amplitude ano in eq. (6.7) to which contribute the two
nonorientable diagrams m1 and m2, does not yet cover the full region of the moduli,
0   /i < , 0  x  1. as explained in 2, the contributions of m1 and
m2 diagrams have a gap in the moduli space and the v diagram just gives the
contribution lling the gap.
the ghost part of the cft correlation function in the v amplitude (2.14) is
calculated in a similar way to the preceding two cases (6.1) and (6.8). noting that

this again correctly gives the same form as the nonorientable amplitude ano in
eq. (6.7).
in this case the moduli integration directions are the same as is seen
shortly, therefore, the full nonorientable amplitude is reproduced in our sft if their
coecients are the same with the same sign:

this integration region corresponds just tor 1
d( /i), where the boundary
value 0(x) is given by the root for  of eq. (3.26) with  = 21x for x  1/2 and
 = 21(1  x) for x  1/2. more explicitly, from eq. (3.26), we see that y = 0
corresponds to  = 21x and y = 1/2 to  = 21(1 x), so that the boundary
value 0(x) is determined by eq. (3.27) with y = 0 and 1/2:

(6.17)

the former equation for x  1/2 just coincides with eq. (3.15) with y = 0 for nonori-
entable m1 case, where y = 0 for m1 case corresponds to the 1 = 0 boundary as is
seen in eq. (3.14). thus m1 diagram covers the moduli regionr 1/2
dxr 0(x)/i d( /i),
1/2 dxr 0(x)/i d( /i) (although we
and, similarly, the m2 diagram covers the region r 1
have not written the mapping explicitly for the latter case).
in fig. 12 (b), it is
shown how the full moduli region 0   /i < , 0  x  1 is covered by these three
diagrams.

6.4. singularities of planar and v amplitudes

the planar amplitude ap in eq. (6.7) and the v amplitude (6.15) both have
a singularity coming from the conguration drawn in fig. 4. these singularities
should cancel each other between these two amplitudes in order for the theory to be
consistent.

to analyze the singularity, we rst rewrite the planar amplitude ap in eq. (6.7)

in terms of the variables (q, ) in place of (w, x):

(cid:26) q = ei = ei/

12 = 2x

 (cid:26) w = e2i

12 = e4i x = e2i12

.

33

in the nal equation we have made the integration region explicit.

next we rewrite the v amplitude (6.15), or more precisely the full nonorientable
amplitude av +ano = av+no, into a similar form using the same variables (q, ).
the integrand is rewritten as

12

n (12, w) =(cid:18)4

where again the integration region has been made explicit. note that 12 = 2x runs
over the range [0,2] in this full nonorientable amplitude so that 12 runs over the
same range [0,1] as the previous 12 in the p case.

now we can compare the two amplitudes (6.21) and (6.25). the singularities

occur at q2 = 0, around which the integrand function is expanded as

[f (q2)]24[f (, q2)]2 = sin h1 + 4(cos 2 + 5)q2 + o(q4)i .

(6.26)

since this is integrated with the measure dq/q3, the rst and the second terms of
this expansion yield singularities corresponding to the (closed) tachyon and dilaton,
respectively. noting that the argument q2 is replaced by q2 for the av+no case,
the latter dilaton singularity can be cancelled between ap and av+no if

at this point we recall the relation (1.6), x = nx2

u = 4ix, derived in i. this
u = 4ix. but, here in the above, we have

t. asakawa, t. kugo and t. takahashi

determined all of n, x2
u and x by computing the loop amplitudes. substituting the
above results (6.11), (6.16) and (6.27), we see that this equality is actually satised.
this gives a rather nontrivial consistency check for the present theory.

there remains, however, a stronger singularity due to tachyon contribution which

under the condition (6.27) adds up between ap and av+no:

where x2
u = i(2)25 is used and the singular endpoint of the q integration has been
cut o by the time length 1   on the -plane, which corresponds to the cuto
q  (81 sin )1 by the mapping relations (3.10) and (3.11).
[for q  1, we
have y = 1/4 + o(q2) from eq. (3.11), and 1/21 = 4q sin  from eq. (3.10).] on
the other hand, as in the case of closed tachyon amplitude considered in i, we still
have another contribution to this amplitude, coming from the counterterm which was
introduced as a renormalization of the zero intercept. the counterterm is contained
in qo

b + og22c0, and so contributes to the open tachyon amplitude as

b = qo

where the value (1.5) for o = c/2 has been substituted. unfortunately, this con-
tribution seems not to cancel the divergence in eq. (6.28) since the coecients dier
by a factor 4/3. however, we should note that the problem is very subtle since
they are divergent quantities; indeed, the value for o = c/2 used in eq. (6.29)
was determined in i considering the cancellation of similar divergences in the case of
closed string tachyon amplitude. so the identication of the cuto parameters  on
the  plane in both terms may not be suitable since the present  plane of the open
tachyon amplitude has boundaries while that of the previous closed tachyon ampli-
tude does not. it is also unclear whether there is no other suitable cuto procedure
with which exact cancellation can be realized. at the moment, unfortunately, we
cannot show that the divergence due to the presence of tachyon is cancelled by the
renormalization of the zero intercept term og22c0, although there is still a chance
of cancellation since eqs. (6.28) and (6.29) have opposite signs in any case.

7. conclusion and discussions

we have shown that the (open) tachyon one-loop 2-point amplitudes are cor-
rectly reproduced in our sft by choosing the coupling constants suitably. all the
coupling constants of the seven interaction vertices have now been determined. some
relations among the coupling constants which are found in the previous two papers
and this paper, turn out to be mutually consistent.

nevertheless the presence of tachyon is a problem in our sft, as is always the
case in bosonic string theories. the (closed) tachyon vanishing into vacuum causes
divergences in various amplitudes. as we have seen at the end of the last section, it
is not clear that even the on-shell amplitudes can be made nite at loop levels by the
renormalization of the zero-intercept term proportional to 2 in qb. moreover, o
the mass-shell, the amplitudes even at the tree level cannot be made nite by such
simple counterterms. indeed, in the closed tachyon 2-point amplitude considered in i,
the cancellation condition of the divergences between the disk (d) and real projective
plane (rp) amplitudes becomes dierent o the mass-shell, where the conformal

factors (qr dzr/dwr)k2/81 become contributing and the imbalance of them between
the d and rp amplitude cases yield the terms proportional to k2  8 and (k2  8)2
at o(q) and o(q2). since the tachyon singularity is as singular asr dq/q3, even such
small dierences of o(q) and o(q2) lead to divergences, proportional to operators
l + l and (l + l)2.

in our computations of one-loop tachyon 2-point amplitudes in this paper, we
had the delta function factor (1  2), with which factor the string diagrams such
as in fig. 1 reduced to the same diagrams as those appearing in the light-cone gauge
sft. 22), 14) so the discussions became almost the same as in the light-cone gauge
sft. for instance, the nonplanar diagram (a) in fig. 2 did not cover the whole
moduli region of the nonplanar one-loop amplitude and required the existence of the
u u diagram (b) in fig. 2, hence explaining the reason of existence of the open-closed
transition vertex u . 14) actually, in the light-cone gauge sft, the former nonplanar
diagram (a) is anomalous from the viewpoint of lorentz-invariance and the anomaly
is cancelled by the diagram (b) at  = 0. this was shown by saito and tanii 9), 10)
and kikkawa and sawada. 11)

in the light-cone gauge sft, there is a universal time (light-cone time) in which
the interactions are local and the time lengths are the same along whichever the
paths on the diagram they are measured. namely, the diagrams in the light-cone
gauge sft are always stretched tight, and there appear no diagrams with propagators
which are slack or propagating backward in the time. the presence of such universal
time was essential in the proof of physical equivalence of the light-cone gauge sft
to the covariant polyakov formulation (hence of the modular and lorentz invariance
of the light-cone gauge sft). 23)

the ultimate reason why the diagrams become tight in the light-cone gauge
string (or particle) eld theory resides in the fact that the vertices there have no
dependence on p , the  components of momenta other than in momentum con-
servation  function: suppose, for instance, that two vertices are connected by two
propagators 1 and 2 simultaneously, thus making a loop. the two propagators can
be represented as

1

r + m 2 =z 

0

p2

dtr e(p2

r+m 2)tr =z 

0

dtr e[2p+

r p

r (p

2

r+m 2)]tr ,

(7.1)

using proper times tr for each string (or particle) r = 1, 2 with m 2 being squared
mass (operator). the momenta pr can be represented as p1 = l and p2 = kl by using
the loop momentum l and a certain external momentum k. then, if the two vertices

36

t. asakawa, t. kugo and t. takahashi

have no dependence on the  components of momenta, i.e., are independent of l
in this case, the l dependence appears only in the propagators and we can perform
the l integration of the loop integral r ddl/(2)d as follows, writing 2p+
z dl
e1lt1e2(kl)t2 = e2kt2(1t1  2t2) = ek2(1  2).

r = r:

(7.2)

namely, the equality of the light-cone times r = rtr resulted for r = 1 and 2. the
same thing happens for any more complicated diagrams and the diagrams become
stretched tight.

in our  = p+ hikko type sft, 7) on the other hand, the vertices has the
dependence on p  and, therefore, there generally appear slack diagrams. as was
explained in some detail in the appendix b of ref. 7), if all the external string states
contain no excitations of n modes, the p  dependent part of the vertices plays no
role and can be discarded, and then only tight diagrams as in the light-cone gauge
case can contribute to the process. this was actually the case in our computation
of the tachyon amplitudes in this paper since the tachyon has no excitation of 
n
modes at all.

if we consider more general external states, however, all the slack diagrams, and
even those with propagators propagating backward in the light-cone time, become
contributing. this is the case, in particular, when we try to prove the brs invari-
ance of the eective action  [, ] possessing general external string elds , .
therefore the brs invariance proof at loop level would look rather dierent from
the computations in the present paper. consider, for instance, the one-loop eec-
tive action 1-loop[ ] quadratic in open-string eld  in eq. (2.1) which contains the
planar diagram contribution

 planar
1-loop [ ] = i

g2

4 z 

0

d1d2 nhvp(1,2)| b1b2|i2|i1,

(7.3)

this term generally corresponds to slack planar diagram in fig. 1 with 1 6= 2.
now act the brs operator on the two external elds r. then, as being a general
property, 6) brs operator acts as an dierential operator on the moduli parameters,
1 and 2 in this case, and obtain two surface terms withr d1 hvp(1,2=0)| b1 and
r d2 hvp(1=0,2)| b2. the former term, for instance, corresponds to the diagram in

which the second propagator is collapsed. which contribution does this term cancel
with?

generically, the loop-level action is brs invariant if the (tree level) action s is.
this should be the case also here. in fact, consider the tree diagrams drawn in fig. 14
and recall that the brs invariance was realized among those three diagrams; 24), 14)
the brs transformation of the diagrams (a) and (c) leaves the surface terms of the
moduli  and  at  = 0 and  = 0, respectively. but the brs transform of the
diagram (b) with quartic interaction v o
4 , yields the surface terms of the moduli 0
at 0 = 0 and  |4|. these are the same congurations as the above two surface
terms of the diagrams (a) at  = 0 and (c) at  = 0 and cancel them.
this cancellation mechanism should also work when these tree diagrams are
lifted to loop diagrams. indeed, if the strings 3 and 4 have the same length, i.e.,

3 = |4|, we can connect the strings 3 and 4 and make one-loop diagrams (a) and
(b) drawn in fig. 15. in this case of 3 = |4|, the diagram (c) disappears. note
that the diagram (a) in fig. 15 is nothing but the slack planar diagram, and that
the diagram at 2 = 0 is just the surface term which we have been discussing in the
above. as is now clear from the above tree level arguments, it is cancelled by the
diagram (b) in fig. 15 at 0 = 0 which is left as a surface term when the diagram
(b) is brs transformed. (a surface term at another endpoint 0 =  |4| would
probably not contribute since it gives a disconnected diagram.) the diagram (b)
gives another surface term at  = 0, but it is as yet not clear whether it vanishes by
itself or not.

finally, we consider two tree diagrams in fig. 16, the sum of which is clearly
brs invariant since the surface terms at  = 0 from those two are the same and
cancel. if strings 3 and 4 have the same length, 3 = |4|, we can again connect
the strings 3 and 4 and obtain one-loop diagrams (a) and (b) drawn in fig. 17. the
resultant diagram (a) is nothing but the nonplanar diagram, generally slack 1 6= 2.
for generic external states, both diagrams (a) and (b) contribute and their surface
terms at 2 = 0 are the same and cancel with each other. so generically the brs
invariance holds with these two diagrams alone. however, if the external states r
contain no n modes, then the delta function factor (1  2) appears and only the
tight diagrams can contribute. this implies that the diagram (b) which contains
backward propagation (i.e., 1 = 4t1 < 0) does not contribute from the start, and
thus the counterterm which can cancel the surface term at 1 = 2 = 0 of diagram
(a) becomes missing. this is an anomaly of the brs invariance in our sft. as
demonstrated in the present paper, the desired counterterm is supplied by the u u
diagram (b) in fig. 2. we suspect that the brs anomalies in our sft occur this
way only when the external states r contain no n modes. if so, then the relevant

diagrams are always tight ones as in the light-cone gauge sft and the anomalies
