(p). however, unlike schwinger model, imposing transversality cs(p) determine a, longitudinal part vanish value a: p cs(p) = 1 (cid:0)p(a 1) + p(cid:1) . (8) course another face two-dimensional chiral anomaly  owing anomalous nonconservation chiral current, quantized chiral schwinger model gauge invariant. nevertheless, possesses physical spectrum > 1, radiatively induced photon mass m: m2 = e2 a2 1 . (9) thus radiative corrections nite undetermined, physical setting model found (perhaps description edge states quantum hall eect), value xed experiment. finally note 6= 0, formal property chiral schwinger model abandoned: owing two-dimensional identity 5 = , gauge eld enters (6) combination (g + )a, con-  4 second example: triangle graphs 6 4 second example: triangle graphs second example nite undetermined radiative corrections even older recall massless, fermionic triangle-loop graphs four dimensions vector, vector, axial vector vertices: (p, q). (the incoming vector mo- menta p q, outgoing axial vector momentum p +q .) three fermion propagators determine triangle, feynman graphs (supercially) linearly divergent (even though eventual evaluation, relying lorentz-invariant calculation, yields nite answer). however, owing linear divergence, shifting integration momentum closed loop changes value integral, essential ambiguity (p, q): evaluation integral produces preferred form, plus undetermined contribution proportional (p q): (p, q) (p, q) + ia(p q) .

(20) several important features expression. two integrals (supercially) linearly divergent. however, divergences cancel two terms taken together traces evaluated. consequence, momentum-routing ambiguity summed integrand. integration momentum shifted amount integrands, value integral change, even though shifting separately dif- ferent amounts two integrands changes value integral surface term. follows dierent momentum routings entire integrand (20) leave value b unchanged, produce si- multaneous shift integration variable amount two integrands. therefore, unique value attached b (p). b (p) lowest order b, replacing gb(k) next evaluate is(k)6 b5s(k). gives (p) = trz d4k b (p) b(p), (2)4ns(k)s(k + p)5s(k + p) + s(k) 5s(k)s(k + p)o .
