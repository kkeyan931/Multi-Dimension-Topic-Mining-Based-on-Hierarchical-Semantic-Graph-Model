abstract

we derive the superconformal transformation properties of the supercurrent for n = 1 su-
persymmetric qed in four dimensions within the supereld formalism. superconformal ward
identities for green functions involving insertions of the supercurrent are conveniently derived by
coupling the supercurrent to the appropriate prepotential of a classical curved superspace back-
ground, and by combining superdieomorphisms and super weyl transformations. we determine
all superconformal anomalies of sqed on curved superspace within an all-order perturbative
approach and derive a local callan-symanzik equation. particular importance is given to the
issue of gauge invariance.

1 introduction

conformal symmetry and superconformal symmetry in particular have attracted much
attention within four-dimensional quantum eld theory for a long period of time as well
as very recently. one of the numerous interesting aspects of conformal symmetry is its
interplay with renormalisation. for quantised eld theories, conformal symmetry is broken
by anomalies in general. the exact determination of these conformal anomalies provides
detailed information about the renormalisation behaviour of a given quantum eld theory.
in particular it is of interest to study the superconformal transformation properties of the
supercurrent, an axial vector supereld from which all currents of the superconformal
group may be obtained by means of a moment construction. the exact knowledge of this
transformation behaviour is expected to be of relevance for instance for a potential proof
of the zamolochikov c theorem in four dimensions. in this context it is essential to study
gauge theories, since for several examples of n = 1 supersymmetric non-abelian gauge
theories it has been shown that the coecient of the topological euler density is larger
in the uv than in the ir limit, in agreement with the conjectured extension of the c
theorem [1].

here we consider eld theories away from xed points, where anomalies involving the
dynamical elds may be present.
in a recent series of papers [2, 3, 4] we have deter-
mined the superconformal transformation behaviour of the supercurrent for the massless
wess-zumino model. for deriving superconformal ward identities for correlation func-
tions involving the supercurrent we have coupled the supercurrent to the appropriate
prepotential of a classical curved superspace background. on curved superspace, super-
conformal transformations are given by the combination of superdieomorphisms and
super weyl transformations. for theories with a conserved energy-momentum tensor,
superdieomorphisms are anomaly-free, such that the breakdown of conformal symme-
try upon quantisation is entirely determined by the anomalies of weyl symmetry. these
manifest themselves in anomalous contributions to the weyl symmetry ward identity.
in [2] we have determined all dynamical anomalies in this ward identity. since all dy-
namical anomalies are given by terms which involve the usual ,  functions as their
coecients, it may be interpreted as a local callan-symanzik (cs) equation. the inte-
gral of this equation agrees with the well-known global cs equation. furthermore there
are purely geometrical superconformal anomalies which involve only the external classical
supergravity elds [3]. these lead to purely local contributions to ward identities for
green functions with multiple insertions of the supercurrent. such ward identities have
been discussed in [4], paying careful attention to the renormalisation behaviour of green
functions with multiple insertions of composite operators. all these results are valid in a
perturbative approach to all orders in .

in the present paper we extend this analysis to the more involved case of n = 1
supersymmetric qed with massless matter and massive vector elds. superconformal
ward identities are again derived by considering a classical curved space background4.

2

however in this case the compatibility of superconformal transformations and of gauge
transformations has to be ensured. for renormalisation we use the bphz approach, and
we follow the procedure developed in [6, 7] for abelian gauge theories on at space, i.e. for
the superconformal transformations properties of green functions without insertions of
the supercurrent.

for dening a covariant gauge eld propagator, we x the gauge explicitly, such that
gauge invariance is broken. the local callan-symanzik equation and the conformal trans-
formation properties of the supercurrent may then be derived in close analogy to the
wess-zumino model. since the gauge xing terms are not conformally invariant, they
contribute to the nal results. however we are able to show that these terms are unphysi-
cal in the sense that they do not contribute when acting on states in the physical hilbert
space. as far as the superconformal transformation of the supercurrent is concerned, we
show that some of the gauge non-invariant terms cancel with the superconformal trans-
formations of the physical states themselves.

this supersymmetric renormalisation scheme appears to be well-suited for deriving the
transformation properties of composite operators to all orders in , and extends in a
natural way to the classical curved space background. a dierent approach to studying
supersymmetric composite operators which keeps gauge invariance manifest has been
discussed in [8] on at space. this has also been applied to anomalies at the one-loop
level.

this paper is organised as follows. we begin by discussing the superconformal and
gauge transformation properties of the dynamical and the background elds in section 2.
using these results we discuss the superconformal and gauge transformation properties
of sqed on curved superspace in section 3. in particular we derive a local cs equation
which characterises all dynamical superconformal anomalies in terms of the usual  and
 functions. with the help of this equation we derive the superconformal transformation
properties of the supercurrent on at space. in section 4 we address the issue of gauge
invariance. section 5 contains some concluding remarks.

2 symmetry transformations of the elds

2.1 superconformal transformations

we consider curved superspace in an approach to supergravity characterised by an axial
vector supereld h,

h = h aa

(2.1)

4to lowest order in the supergravity prepotentials, the geometrical method for deriving such ward

identities has been discussed in [5].

and a chiral compensator   exp(j) satisfying

d  = 0 ,

d  = 0 ,

where

da  (a, d, d )

(2.2)

(2.3)

are the well known partial and at space supersymmetry derivatives respectively, which
span the tangent space5. this approach to supergravity is presented in [2], [3], [4]. further
details may be found in the textbooks [9], [10]. this applies also to the denition the
supercovariant derivatives, denoted by

da  (da, d, d ) ,

(2.4)

which are the covariant derivatives associated to the group of superdieomorphisms on
curved superspace and which depend on h. moreover it should be noted that throughout
this paper we use the curved space chiral representation which is analogous to the at
space chiral representation in which all elds  are replaced by  = eia a . complex
conjugation of  in the chiral representation yields  in the antichiral representation. on
curved space, the chiral representation expression for the conjugate of  is given by e2ih .
this is of particular importance for the gauge supereld.

the superdieomorphisms are given by a complex supereld  and its conjugate ,

 = aa + d +   d  + m +   m   ,
 = aa + d +   d  + m +   m   ,

(2.5)

where  is in the chiral and  in the antichiral representation, and m, m are the gene-
rators of innitesimal lorentz transformations. covariance constraints imply that the
dieomorphism components may be written as

  = i d  ,  = 1

d2 ,   = e2ih   ,  = e2ih  ,

(2.6)

in terms of an unconstrained supereld , with corresponding expressions for . the
dieomorphism transformation properties of the supergravity prepotentials are given by

for the real axial vector prepotential h and by

e2ih  ee2ih e  ,

c = aa + d

for the chiral compensator, both in the chiral representation.

(2.7)

(2.8)

5in our conventions the metric has diagonal elements (+1,1,1,1).the covariant derivatives satisfy

{d, d } = 2ia

 a.

the super weyl transformations are given by superelds ,  which satisfy d  = 0,

d = 0. for the weyl transformation properties of the prepotentials we have

h  h,

  e,

  e .

(2.9)

it is crucial to note that h is weyl invariant. superconformal transformations satisfy the
additional relations

 =   d  = d   ,

 =  1

12

d2d .

(2.10)

for the dynamical elds of supersymmetric qed we have two chiral matter elds

a+, a and their chiral partners, which under parity transform as

their dieomorphism and weyl transformation properties are given by

p a+ = a ,

pa = a+ .

the spinorial components 

a  ea , a  ea .

 of a+, a form a dirac spinor

d = +

 

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

such that a theory involving a+, a describes the coupling of a dirac particle to the
electromagnetic eld. the appropriate gauge supereld  is dimensionless and real. under
dieomorphisms

  e .

(2.14)

since its canonical dimension is zero,  is weyl invariant in the classical case discussed
here.

it should be noted that in the chiral representation used above, the reality condition

on  reads

 = e2ih  .

(2.15)

in order to avoid such h dependent constraint on , it is more convenient to use the real
representation in which

 = eih ,

(2.16)

such that  = . by explicit calculation we nd that in the real representation, to lowest
order in h, the gauge eld has the dieomorphism transformation property

  e(1/2(a+ a)a+d+   d ) .

(2.17)

5

2.2 gauge transformations

the gauge transformations of the matter elds are given by

a+(z) = ig(z)a+(z) ,

a(z) = +ig(z)a(z) ,

d  = 0 ,

(2.18)

with g the charge and  chiral. for the gauge eld we have

again it is not convenient to consider such h dependent gauge transformation. therefore
we use the gauge at representation of [10],

  = i(cid:0)eih   eih (cid:1) .

(2.19)

 =(cid:18)cosh(ih) +

sinh(ih)

ih

2 h  [d, d ](cid:19)

for which

 is real,  =

.

  = i(cid:0)  (cid:1) .

(2.20)

(2.21)

moreover the supergravity elds are gauge invariant. the innitesimal forms for all
eld transformations discussed may be found in appendix a.1. these are relevant for
deriving ward identities.

3 transformation properties of the supercurrent

our aim is to derive superconformal ward identities for green functions involving in-
sertions of the supercurrent for supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics (sqed). for
renormalisation we use the bphz approach [11], in which integrands whose integrals are
potentially divergent are expanded into power series in external momenta. then terms of
this series are subtracted such that the integrals over the remaining terms are well-dened
nite expressions.

we determine the dynamical anomalies present in the weyl symmetry ward identity
to all orders in perturbation theory. the purely geometrical anomalies depending on the
classical background supergravity elds only are the same as discussed in [3], save for the
coecients which are model dependent.

the transformation properties of the supercurrent va are obtained by virtue of the
action principle, according to which the variation of the vertex functional with respect to
the external eld ha yields an insertion of the supercurrent,

[va]   = 8


h a  .

6

(3.1)

as shown in [2, 4], superconformal ward identities are conveniently obtained by combining
superdieomorphism and super weyl transformations on curved superspace. the dieo-
morphism invariance of sqed is preserved by the renormalisation scheme to all orders
in perturbation theory, which ensures energy-momentum conservation. the anomalies of
superconformal symmetry are thus given by the anomalies of super weyl symmetry.

the use of the eld  as dened implicitly in (2.20) is vital for ensuring that - discarding
gauge xing terms - va as given by (3.1) is gauge invariant. furthermore the use of 
ensures that at the classical level where no anomalies are present, va is a conformally
covariant, i.e. quasi-primary eld. this is due to the fact that the ward operator

 ( ) as in appendix a.2 and with 

with w
contribution to rst order in h.

conf satisfying (2.10) has no h dependent

3.1 sqed on curved superspace

we discuss the quantised theory within perturbation theory to all orders in . a basis of
dieomorphism invariant eld monomials involving the chiral matter superelds a+, a,
as well as the real abelian gauge supereld eld , is given by

i =z d6z 3f f ,
ig =z d8z e 1(cid:0) a+ega+ + aega(cid:1) ,
im =z d8z e 12 ,

igf =z d8z e 1( d2 + r)(d2 + r) ,
i =z d6z 3ra+a ,
im =z d6z 3a+a ,

(3.3)

where f = ( d2+r)d is the eld strength, with r the chiral supersymmetric curvature
scalar. e 1 is the general curved superspace integration measure and 3, the cube of the
chiral compensator, is the integration measure for chiral subspace. ( d2 + r) and (d2 + r)
are chiral and anti-chiral projection operators respectively. furthermore there is also a
basis for local chiral eld monomials leading to (3.3) upon integration, which is given by

l = 3f f ,

lgf = 3( d2 + r)(cid:0)( d2 + r)(d2 + r)(cid:1) , l
lg = 3( d2 + r)(cid:0) a+ega+ + aega(cid:1) ,

l = 3ra+a ,
lm = 3( d2 + r)2 ,

gf = 3( d2 + r)(cid:0)(d2 + r)( d2 + r)(cid:1) ,
 = 3( d2 + r)(cid:0) a+ a(cid:1) ,

lm = 3a+a .

4 m(s  1)(im + im) + 1

16dm 2im  1

128 igf .

(3.5)

here the coecients z, zg,  and dm 2 are power series in . i and ig are the curved

superspace generalisations of the usual terms contributing to sqed on at space. i
describes the coupling of the curved space background to the matter elds. the factor
(s  1) in front of the matter eld mass terms is an auxiliary parameter participating in
the subtractions, which is necessary for consistent renormalisation of massless theories, as
described below. it may be set to s = 1 at the very end of the renormalisation procedure.

we also include a mass term dm 2im for the gauge eld. this ensures in particular that

there is no infrared problem. finally for a consistent perturbative approach which requires
a well-dened covariant gauge eld propagator, we x the gauge by including the gauge
xing term igf with  the gauge parameter. therefore the gauge ward identity has the
form

w()(a, ) = i 3( d2 + r)n 1

128 r(d2 + r)  1

(3.7)

we derive a local callan-symanzik equation in close analogy to the procedure followed for
the wess-zumino model in [2]. according to the discussion of the weyl transformation
properties of both dynamical and geometrical elds in section 2, the local chiral weyl
symmetry ward operator is given by

w()(a, j) =


j  a+


a+  a



a

(3.8)

where j is given by   exp(j) with  the chiral compensator. applying this operator
to the vertex functional  as given by (3.5) we obtain

where the square brackets denote an insertion of local composite operators, and lm , lm ,

8

we see that in addition to the mass terms, the matter-background coupling and the gauge
xing terms are not weyl invariant. for exploring the consequences of this ward identity
further, we use appropriate zimmermann identities [12, 7]. these identities express hard
insertions in terms of the corresponding soft insertion plus a basis of hard local eld
monomials with the appropriate symmetries and quantum numbers. here the relevant
identities are, using the basis (3.4),

in . by integrating the identity (3.14) over chiral superspace, it may be shown that
t = 0.

in order to eliminate the symmetry breaking terms l of matter-background coupling

type from the ward identity (3.9), we impose r invariance

w r = 0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=1

.

(3.16)

here the r symmetry ward operator is obtained from the superconformal ward operator
combining dieomorphisms and weyl transformations, by using

 (r) = i 2r ,

(r) = 2

3 ir ,

(3.17)

for the parameter  of local superconformal transformations (2.10), as appropriate for
r symmetry transformations. this gives

the imposition of r invariance implies

 ,

(3.20)

which xes the coupling  uniquely as a function of the coupling g and thus amounts to
a reduction of couplings [13].

the ward identity (3.9) leads to a callan-symanzik (cs) equation since from dimen-

sional analysis we have

e = iw de ,

w d = z d6z w() + z d6 z w() ,

(3.21)

c = 1

where  stands for all mass parameters of the theory. thus using the zimmermann

this hard symmetry breaking term may be simplied using the zimmermann identity

(3.36)

when reducing to at space, the gauge xing term on the r.h.s. vanishes when acting on
states of the physical hilbert space, as was shown in [6, 7]. this is essentially due to its
reduced subtraction degree. thus the physical degrees of freedom in sqed on at space

11

are gauge parameter independent. here it is straightforward to extend this argument to
green functions involving an insertion of the supercurrent by making use of (3.1) and
varying (3.36) with respect to the superpotential h , which gives, when restricting to
at superspace,

  the gauge non-invariant part of the supercurrent. each of the terms on the
r.h.s. have been shown to be unphysical on at space, as discussed in [7]. thus when acting
on states of the physical hilbert space, the supercurrent insertion is gauge parameter
independent.

3.4 local callan-symanzik equation

just as for the wess-zumino model [2], we derive a local cs equation, i.e. we express
the anomalies present in the local chiral weyl symmetry ward identity (3.9) in such a
way that upon integration and combination with the corresponding antichiral equation we
recover the global cs equation (3.22). for this purpose we introduce the chiral eective

for the coupling . in (3.43), w
(3.42), which is chiral, characterises all dynamical anomalies of superconformal symmetry.
the global cs equation (3.22) is recovered by integrating (3.42) and adding the complex
conjugate, where, as far as the gauge xing terms are concerned, the agreement is due to
(3.36). from the local cs equation (3.42) we see that the breakdown of superconformal
invariance manifests itself in anomalous dimensions for the elds and in an insertion of
le with the usual  function as coecient. moreover the mass terms break conformal
symmetry as expected. in (3.42) we may now set s = 1. furthermore there are gauge
xing terms breaking superconformal symmetry. however these do not contribute when
acting on states of the physical hilbert space, as is discussed in section 4 below.

3.5 transformation properties of the supercurrent

by combining the local callan-symanzik equation (3.42) with the local ward identity ex-
pressing dieomorphism invariance, we obtain the superconformal transformation proper-
ties of the supercurrent. in agreement with the discussion of section 2 and using the local
ward operators listed in appendix a.2 and in (3.43), we have, restricting the transforma-
tion parameters  and  to be of the superconformal form (2.10),

z d8z (cid:0)w()

 + 1

12 dw(,)(cid:1)  + c.c. =z d6z [s()]   + c.c. ,

(3.45)

where s() stands for the r.h.s. of the local cs equation (3.42). from this superconformal
ward identity we obtain the superconformal transformation properties of the supercur-
rent insertion by varying (3.45) with respect to h  and subsequently restricting to at
superspace, which yields

a 

w (a,)(conf )[v (z)]  

= [v (z)]

and where w(a)
are obtained from the at space restriction of the combined dieomorphism and weyl
operators. moreover the classical superconformal transformation of the supercurrent is
given by

v (cid:1) +(cid:0)(cid:8)d, d (cid:9) d

(cid:1)v  + d(cid:0) d2v (cid:1) + c.c. .

for the classical theory without gauge xing, the supercurrent v  is conformally co-
variant, i.e. a quasi-primary eld. furthermore in (3.46), for any insertion [s] the curly
brackets denote

(3.48)

{v (z)  s(z)}    8



h  (z)

[s(z)]   = [v (z)]  [s(z)]   + 8(cid:20) s(z)

h  (z)(cid:21)   .

(3.49)

finally the last term on the r.h.s. of (3.46) is due to the h dependence of  as given
by (2.20), which leads to an anomalous conformal transformation of  in the quantised
theory. this reects the fact that after quantisation, the gauge eld  is no longer quasi-
primary.

4 gauge invariance

the superconformal transformation of the supercurrent as given by (3.46) contains terms
involving the gauge xing and thus is seemingly not gauge invariant. however this is only
apparent. in this section we show that when acting on elements |pi of the hilbert space
of physical states, with innitesimal superconformal transformation |pi, then

 (hp|v |pi) = hp| (v ) |pi + hp|v |pi + hp|v |pi

(4.1)

is gauge invariant.  is the superconformal transformation corresponding to a 
w (a,)()
acting on [v (z)]   in (3.46). for showing gauge invariance we note that the physical
states satisfy

(d2)()|pi = ( d2)()|pi = 0 ,

hp|(d2)(+) = hp|( d2)(+) = 0 ,

(4.2)

14

where (), (+) stand for contributions involving annihilation or creation operators, re-
spectively. requiring the conditions (4.2) to be invariant under an anomalous weyl trans-
formation with weight , in agreement with (3.43), we have

0 = (hp| d2|pi) = (1  1
0 = (hp|d2|pi) = (1  1
furthermore using (4.2) we have

2 )hp| d2()|pi + hp| d2|pi + hp| d2|pi ,
2 )hp| d2()|pi + hp|d2|pi + hp|d2|pi .

hp| d2()|pi = hp|(2 d  d )|pi .

(4.3)

(4.4)

using these relations we nd for the gauge non-invariant part v g
dened in (3.38), when acting on the transformation of the physical states |pi,

  of the supercurrent

hp|v g

 |pi + hp|v g

 |pi = (1  1

2 ) hp| (t  + c.c.) |pi ,

(4.5)

with
t   1

24(cid:0)[d, d ] d2(dd)   d d d2(dd) + d d d2(dd)(cid:1) .

(4.6)

furthermore by explicit calculation we nd for the contribution of the gauge xing terms
to hp|v |pi in (4.1) as given by (3.46)

hp|v |gf|pi   1

16hp|



h  (z)(cid:16)z d6z (z)(cid:16)(l

2 (lgf + l

gf )(cid:17) + c.c.(cid:17)|pi

(4.7)

= (1  1

2 )hp|(t  + c.c.)|pi ,

with t  as in (4.6). therefore the contributions of (4.5) and (4.7) to (4.1) cancel each
other,

hp|v |gf|pi + hp|v g

 |pi + hp|v g

 |pi = 0 .

(4.8)

thus the conformal transformation of the gauge xing contribution to the supercurrent
is compensated by the conformal transformation of the physical states. furthermore we
show that the remaining contributions to (3.46) vanish between physical states. using
the results of [7] we have
hp|v g

(4.9)

 |pi  hp|(cid:0)(cid:0)  3

2 ( + )(cid:1) v g

for the contribution of the gauge xing term to the classical superconformal transformation
of the supercurrent. furthermore the gauge eld contact terms in (3.46) may be shown
to be gauge invariant by making use of the zimmermann identity (3.13) once more. since
for superconformal transformations a = a, we have for the last term in (3.46)

 (cid:1)|pi = 0

(cid:0)d d   d d(cid:1) 



= d (cid:18)d 



(cid:19)  d(cid:18) d  



(cid:19) .

(4.10)

15

the gauge xing terms contributing to this expression are given by





=  1

2   .
without chiral projection, the zimmermann identity (3.13) reads

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)gf
2   =(cid:2)d2 d2 +  d2d2(cid:3)0
(cid:2)d2 d2 +  d2d2(cid:3)2

128(cid:2)d2 d2 +  d2d2(cid:3)2

0  

+(cid:2)rg( a+ega+ + aega) + r(a+a + a+ a)(cid:3)2

on at space. thus the gauge xing terms contributing to (4.11) are not subtracted and
therefore vanish between physical states by virtue of (4.2). the remaining terms in (4.12)
are gauge invariant. - this completes our proof that (4.1) with v  given by (3.46) is
gauge invariant for physical states.

(4.11)

(4.12)
2  

similarly we may show that the local cs equation (3.42) is gauge invariant when sand-
wiched between physical states. for this we generalise (4.2) to curved superspace. the
operators d2, d2 are solutions of the at space chiral equations of motion

(4.13)
with a  d2, a  d2, such that d2, d2 are free elds. the curved space
generalisation of (4.13) is obtained by varying the action

16 d2 d2 a  m2 a = 0 ,

d2d2a  m2a = 0 ,

given in the chiral representation. this action consists of the gauge xing and mass terms
as well as of an additional term coupling the gauge eld to the supergravity background.
for

(4.14)

(4.15)

a  (d2 + r)

we obtain

1

a  ( d2 + r) ,
16( d2 + r)(cid:0)( d2 + r) a + ( d2 + r)a(cid:1)
16(d2 + r)(cid:0)(d2 + r)a + (d2 + r) a(cid:1)

1

4( d2 + r)(ra + r a)  m2a = 0 ,
+ 1

(4.16)
with m = m, which is the equation of motion for chiral elds with minimal coupling
to supergravity,  = 1
4 for  as in (3.5). thus (4.15) is a solution of the free chiral equation
of motion on curved superspace, such that the physical hilbert space is given by

4(d2 + r)(ra + r a)  m2 a = 0 ,
+ 1

(( d2 + r))()|pi = ((d2 + r))()|pi = 0 ,
hp|(( d2 + r))(+) = hp|((d2 + r))(+) = 0 ,

(4.17)

16

in analogy to (4.2). using this it is immediately obvious that the local cs equation (3.42)
is gauge invariant between physical states. - the last term in (4.14) has not been taken
into account in the discussion of the local cs equation in section 3.4. however using
(4.17) these terms may be easily seen to vanish between physical states.

5 conclusion

from (3.46) it is straightforward to obtain the superconformal transformation properties
for connected green functions with an insertion of the supercurrent. we nd

hv (z) xi =z d6z (z)hggle(z)  v (z) xi + c.c. + soft terms ,

where

x = a(z1) . . . a(zn) a(zn+1) . . . a(zm) .

(5.1)

(5.2)

since the connected green functions are dened according to the gell-mann-low formula,
the discussion of section 4 applies and (5.1) is gauge invariant. the superconformal
transformation  is dened by

 hv (z) xi = hv (z) xi

+

+

nxk=1
mxk=1

hv (z) a(z1) . . . a(zk) . . . a(zn) a(z

1) . . . a(z

m)i

hv (z) a(z1) . . . a(zn) a(z

1) . . .  a(z

k) . . . a(z

m)i ,

with v (z) the classical conformal transformation given by (3.48), and

(5.3)

(5.4)

a = (  (1 + a) ) a ,

 a =(cid:0)  (1 + a) (cid:1) a .

we consider matter elds only in (5.2) for simplicity. for gauge elds  there are addi-
tional terms arising from the last term in (3.46).

in this paper we have determined a suitable eld structure for discussing both conformal
transformations and gauge invariance, from which we have obtained ward operators which
ensure conformal covariance of the supercurrent. our result (5.1) states that there is a
gauge invariant expression for the superconformal transformation properties of green
functions with a supercurrent insertion which is well-dened to all orders in perturbation
theory, including the soft mass breaking terms. discarding these we see that hv   xi
is conformally invariant when the  function vanishes (which for sqed considered here
applies just to the free theory). for superconformal theories as relevant to rg xed

17

points, correlation functions involving the supercurrent have been constructed explicitly
in [14] using the symmetry constraints.

so far we have considered one insertion of the supercurrent only. ward identities
involving green functions with multiple insertions of the supercurrent, hv (z1) v (z2)
    v (zn)  xi, may in principle be obtained by varying (3.46) an appropriate number
of times with respect to the supergravity prepotential h. however in this case the proof
of gauge invariance in analogy to the calculation performed in section 4 gets very tedious
since higher orders in h have to be considered explicitly. in this case a brs approach
seems more appropriate, which applies of course also to a possible generalisation to non-
abelian gauge theories6.

as a nal remark we discuss the consequences of r invariance. we write the r sym-

metry operator dened in (3.18) in the form

w r  iz d4x w .

(5.5)

for the subsequent discussion, it is important to remember that w contains both dieo-
morphisms and weyl transformations. r invariance implies

w r = 0  w = total divergence .

calculating w as given by (5.5) we nd, when restricting to at space,

hava  xi = ih(d2s  d2 s)  xi +xj

f r(z  zj)hx i ,

(5.6)

(5.7)

where s is the weyl symmetry breaking term given by (3.9). evaluating this term with
the help of the zimmermann identities (3.11), (3.12) we nd

ih(d2s  d2 s)  xi = 8i a(cid:0)2a + i(d d)a(cid:1)hb  xi ,

va is the supercurrent of sqed as given by (3.1) with the action (3.5). b arises from
the gauge eld term d2f f  d2 f  f . the zimmermann coecients ug, u, u
, u, vg,
v are related to the  and  functions by virtue of (3.24), (3.25) and (3.30). the terms
involving f r(z  zj) in (5.7) are contact terms arising from varying w as given by (5.5)
with respect to the matter elds in order to obtain x as in (5.2). it is a specic feature

(5.11)

18

of the weyl anomalies present in sqed with massless matter elds that they may be
written as total divergences in the r symmetry ward identity. this is due to the fact
that they are of the form s = d2b.

as follows from the discussion of [7], the supercurrent va in (5.7) as given by (3.1) has

the component decomposition

va(z) = ra(x)  i(qa (x)  1

 4( )b(tab(x)  1

) + i ( qa

c(x) + 1

3 (ab) 

qb )



(5.12)

with the r current, the supersymmetry currents qa, qa  and the energy momentum
tensor tab. furthermore we may dene a current

  = v  + 4[d, d ]b ,
v b

with b as in (5.9), whose divergence is anomaly-free,

hav b

a  xi =xj

f r(z  zj)hx i .

(5.13)

(5.14)

this is referred to as changing from so-called s to b breaking in [7] (see also [2]). the
current (5.13) has the component decomposition

a (z) = ra(x) + q a(x) +   q 
v b

a(x) + ( )btab(x) + . . . .

(5.15)

we note that v b
a

is not gauge invariant since b is not gauge invariant.

finally we discuss a current whose divergence agrees with the chiral anomaly. the

current

v 
  = v  + k  ,
k  = 4[d, d ]b5

=  1

3[d, d ](cid:16)(2ug + 1

(5.18)

which coincides with v b

   4[d, d ]b, satises the ward identity
6 i u h(d2f f  d2 f  f )  xi
a  xi =  1
+xj

f r(z  zj)hx i .

v 
a is gauge invariant except for the soft mass term. its signicance arises from the fact
that the coecient u of its anomaly has no corrections beyond one loop [16]. this
same coecient appears in the anomaly of the so-called konishi current [17], which is

19

the current associated with r symmetry on at space without coupling to supergravity,
where the chiral local r symmetry ward operator is given by

w5  a+



a+

+ a



a

.

(5.19)

therefore the current v 
a as given by (5.16) satises an adler-bardeen theorem in the sense
that its gauge anomaly has no quantum corrections beyond one loop. it has to be noted
however that the higher  components of v 
a neither correspond to the supersymmetry
currents nor to the energy-momentum tensor.

(5.18) shows that although the chiral anomaly and the superconformal trace anomaly
as expressed by the divergence of the supercurrent are related, the trace anomaly and
thus the  functions may acquire higher order corrections while the chiral anomaly is
one-loop. this issue is discussed from a dierent point of view in [18]. the discussion
here shows how the geometrical structure of the supergravity background relates the two
anomalies. eectively the konishi anomaly appears as a term breaking weyl invariance,
whereas the supercurrent is present in the dieomorphism ward identity since it is coupled
to the prepotential h  . thus in the superconformal ward identity which relates weyl
symmetry and dieomorphisms both currents are present.
