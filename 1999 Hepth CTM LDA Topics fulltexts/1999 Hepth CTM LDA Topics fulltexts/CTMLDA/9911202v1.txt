abstract a string background, which is in some precise sense universal (i.e.,

incorporating all orders in the feynman diagram expansion), is proposed to represent

pure gauge theories. s-duality at the level of the string metric is considered as well as the

vacuum expectation values of t hooft and wilson loops in semiclassical approximation.

vacuum congurations for the closed bosonic string are determined by the sigma model

beta function equations [9], [10] . these are the equations that ensure world sheet confor-

mal invariance. at tree level in string perturbation theory these equations, for vanishing

tachyon expectation value, are given by:

r   = 0
2 + ()2 = c

(1)

(2)

with  the dilaton eld and the constant c being determined by the target space-time

dimension as follows:

c =

26  d

(3)

the renormalization group approach to the string representation of gauge theories [4],

[5],[3] is based on:

i) identifying the string coupling constant with the yang mills coupling:

g = e


2

(4)

ii) identifying one space-time coordinate with the renormalization group variable ,

and

iii) looking for vacuum solution to equations (1)(2) and to the renormalization group

equation:

for  the yang mills beta function.

in this letter we will present a critical ,i.e c = 0, universal solution to equations

(1),(2),(6) for (g) a generic formal power series of g of the type:

before going into a brief discussion on the physical meaning of this string metric let us

prove that metric (7) with d = 21 and a dilaton eld given be () is in fact solution to

equations (1) and (2) for c = 0.

the proof of our previous statement follows directly from the expression for the ricci

tensor for the universal metric

(where a  e2 and b  e22). the most illustrative condition comes, however, from
the beta function of the dilaton, = 2 + ()2, which can be easily shown to be equal
to e2(2  d/2)).

it is important to notice that the metric (7) is solution of the sigma model beta function

equations only if d = 21 with the other ve coordinates having the meaning of the four

dimensional space-time coordinates and the renormalization group scale. moreover the

universal metric is solution independently of the sign of the beta function i.e both for

asymptotically or infrared free theories. the dierence between them is related to the

meaning of the singularity of the metric. actually, the metric (7) has a naked singularity

at e = 0 corresponding - depending on the sign of the beta function- to the conning scale

or the landau pole. in both cases the geometrization of the physics beyond the singularity

should be related with non analytic extensions of the metric. moreover the curvature of

the universal metric diverges either in the ultraviolet or in the infrared depending on the

sign of the gauge beta function (positive in the former case, and negative in the latter).

at the level of the metric the s-duality transformation can be implemented as:

  

(9)

hence we can dene the s-dual metric by performing the transformation (9) on the uni-

versal metric. from a physical point of view this s dual metric should correspond to the

2

same gauge theory but described in terms of t hoofts loop variables [15].

it would be convenient for future discussion to dene the universal metric as the ve

dimensional piece of the metric (7) and to consider this metric as solution to the sigma

model beta function equations with c = 0. an important property of this ve dimensional

metric is that it is conformally at. introducing new coordinates x = 2x and z2 = e

the ve dimensional metric becomes:

with a dilaton eld

ds2 = 4z2(d~x

2

d + dz2)

(z) = lnz2

dierent imput yang mills beta functions correspond to changes of variables

z  z()

(10)

(11)

(12)

with  the renormalization group coordiante.

it is worth noticing the dierence between metric (10) and the ads metric in ve

dimensions

ds2 = z2(d~x2

d + dz2)

(13)

these two conformally at metrics are special in the following sense.

in the ads case

the ricci tensor which is determined in terms of the conformal factor becomes exactly

equal to a cosmological constant term. in the case (10) the ricci tensor becomes exactly

equal to  for  the logarithm of the conformal factor in (10). we feel these two
metrics are the natural candidates to describe gauge theories with vanishing [16],[19],[14]

and non vanishing beta functions respectively2 . notice that in our framework ,based on

the closed bosonic string, the case of vanishing beta function is a bit special. namely

in this case the only solution is at minkowski in 26 critical dimensions. in other words

2 an important dierence between ads metric and metric (10) is the existence of a singularity for the

metric (10) in contrast with the horizon in the ads case.

3

for c = 0 and constant dilaton the equations (1) and 2 do not determine in any natural

way the dimension of the space-time in contrast to the case where the beta function does

not vanish, where four dimensional space-time is singled out. moreover we should expect,

from physical grounds based in wilson loop computations [17] ,[20], that the conformally

invariant situation, , corresponding to vanishing beta function will determine string metrics

that are invariant under appropiated conformal rescalings of the coordinates, which is not

the case for at minkowski metric ( as opposed to ads5, which enjoys the conformal group,

so(2, 4), as its isometry group). in this sense please notice that the universal metric (10)

is not invariant under rescalings of the coordinates, which is only natural owing to our non

trivial dilaton background 3.

the predictive power of the renormalization group approach to the string description

of pure gauge theories should be contained in those dynamical aspects of the gauge theory

that we can describe in terms of what it is properly speaking the string output of our

construction, namely the string space-time metric. the rst prediction in this sense is

related with the so called zamolodchikovs c-theorem. it was proved in reference [21], for

two dimensional quantum eld theories, the existence of a c-function ,roughly counting

the number of degrees of freedom, that monotonically decreases along the renormalization

group ow. in reference [4] ( see also [8],[12],[2],[18],[13]) it was suggested, in the holo-

graphic scheme, a generalization of this theorem to four dimensional quantum eld theories

admiting a ve dimensional gravitational description. the idea is of course to relate the

function c with some geometrical property of the string metric and to use the sigma model

beta function equations to derive the desired behavior for c. the most natural candidate

3 the problem with the string representation of pure gauge theories with vanbishing beta function i.e

with pure maxwell theory of free photons, could be probably be related to a similar problem appearing in

the ads approach, concerning the physical interpretation of the near horizon geometry of just one d-brane

(cf. ([6]). in heuristic physical terms the problem has its origin in trying to represent in terms of gravity

a purely linear theory [19]

for c is the inverse of the expansion parameter  for a congruence of null geodesics. in

terms of the gauge beta function we get for the universal metric the following behavior of

with fu () a universal function independent of beta given by

(14)

(15)

as it is clear from (14) the sign of variation of  depends on the sign of the beta function

and therefore we nd that the c-function dened in terms of  behaves in opposite way for

the theory and its s dual.

a typical test of any string description of gauge theories is the representation of vacuum

expectation values for the wilson loop as sums over random surfaces with xed boundary

determined by the loop. in the semiclassical approximation this vacuum expectation value

is given by the surface that minimize the nambu-goto action. this action depends on the

induced string metric and on the particular value of the string tension as follows

s =

(16)

since we are identifying the string coupling constant with the four dimensional yang mills

coupling we should use in (16) the running  determined by the soft dilaton theorem

relation [1]

(17)

where a(k; p1, p2, ...pn) is the amplitude for a soft dilaton insertion of momentum k and

n external gluon vertex operators with momentum (p1, p2, ...pn). for d = 4 in (17) we get

that the running string  behaves in precisely the opposite way to the running coupling

5

constant 4 . this produces automatically the area law for negative beta function

v (l)  l

(18)

for the static potential in the approximation of innite massive quarks. what happens if

we perform now the same computation in the s dual metric?. in this case we must change

the sign of  in metric (7) and we get , after introducing in the nambu-goto action the

eective  5 a static potential of type

v (l)  l5

(19)

i.e a non conning behavior for the expectation value of the t hooft loop, as it should be

expected from s duality [15]. 6

to conclude just a comment on possible string corrections to the sigma model beta

function equations. we know that tadpoles beyond tree level will in general modify the

form of the background string metric by a fishler-susskind [11] type of mechanism. the

dierence between it and the rga stems precisely from the interpretation of the renormal-

ization group scale as a spacetime coordinate. this in particular implies that the eect of

tadpoles is absorbed in the dilaton dependence on this coordinate; but we have shown that

this dependence can be always integrated in the universal metric. the problem of tachyon

stability of the string metric worked out in this letter is analyzed in a dierent paper see

ref [7].

4 this behavior implies in particular that the four dimensional formal newton constant dened, in the

usual way, as g is invariant under dilatations.

5 notice that independently of the sign the soft dilaton theorem ensures that  and the yang mills

coupling scale in opposite way in the renormalization group

6 notice that for constant  i.e without using the soft dilaton theorem renormalization we get for

negative beta function a static potential of type v (l)  l3 and for the s dual metric v (l)  l3.
