abstract

the complete proof of a theorem announced in [1] on the consistent
interactions for (non-chiral) exterior form gauge elds is given. the
theorem can be easily generalized to the analysis of anomalies.
its
proof amounts to computing the local brst cohomology h 0(s|d) in
the space of local n-forms depending on the elds, the ghosts, the
antields and their derivatives.

1 introduction

geometric attempts to generalize the yang-mills construction to p-form gauge
elds with p > 1 have led to no-go results that indicate that this goal cannot
be achieved while maintaining spacetime locality [2, 3, 4].

in fact, self-interactions of p-form gauge elds are so constrained that
one can completely list them, even if one drops any a priori geometric in-
terpretation of the p-forms as connections for extended objects. this task
was explicitly performed in [1], where the following question was analyzed.
consider the free action,

i = z dnxxa

(

h a

1...pa +1h a1...pa+1),

(1.1)

for a system of (non-chiral) exterior form gauge elds ba
here, the h as are the eld strengths or curvatures,

1...pa

of degree  2.

h a =

1...pa

(1.2)

(1.3)

we assume throughout that the spacetime dimension satises the condition
n > pa + 1 for each a so that all the pa-forms have local degrees of freedom.
the action (1.1) is invariant under the abelian gauge transformations,

ba  ba + da,

(1.4)

where a are arbitrary pa  1 forms. the equations of motion, obtained by
varying the elds ba

, are given by,

1...pa

h a1...pa = 0  dh

a

= 0,

(1.5)

where h

a

is the dual of h a1...pa .

the question addressed in [1] was: what are the consistent (local) inter-
actions that can be added to the free action (1.1)? interaction terms are said
to be consistent if their preserve the number (but not necessarily the form)
of the independent gauge symmetries.

1

of course, one can always add to (1.1) gauge-invariant interaction terms

constructed out of the curvature components and their derivatives,

z f (h (k)

1...pk +1,  h (k)

1...pk +1,    , 1...q h (k)

1...pk +1)dnx.

(1.6)

being strictly gauge-invariant, these terms actually do not deform the gauge
symmetries. one may, however, also search for interaction terms that deform
not only the action, but also the gauge transformations. these turn out to
be extremely scarce, as the following theorem indicates:

theorem 1.1 besides the obvious gauge-invariant interactions, the only
consistent interaction vertices that can be added to (1.1) have the noether
form,

v = x(a)

g(a)v(a)

where the g(a) are the coupling constants and the v(a) read

v(a) = z j(t)  b(t).

(1.7)

(1.8)

here, j(t) are gauge-invariant conserved (n  pt)-forms, dj(t)  0, and there-
fore, are exhausted by the exterior polynomials in the curvature forms h (k)
and their duals h (k) [5].

because j(t) must have exactly form-degree n  pt, so that the form degree
of the integrand of (1.8) matches the spacetime dimension n, there may be
no vertex of the type (1.7) for given spacetime dimension and form-degrees
of the exterior form gauge elds. for example, a set of 2-form gauge elds
admits gauge symmetry-deforming non-trivial interactions only in n = 4
dimensions [6] and these are of the freedman-townsend type [7]. other
examples of vertices of the form (1.8) involving p-form gauge elds of dierent
form degrees are provided by the chapline-manton interactions [8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13]. the analysis of [1] also enabled one to exhibit new symmetry-
deforming interactions, but again only in special dimensions (see also [14];
these interactions have been further analysed in [15, 16]).

in (1.8), the j(t) are exterior polynomials in h (k) and h (k) with coecients
that can involve dx. if one imposes lorentz invariance, bare dxs cannot
appear. note also that if (n  1)-forms are included, an innite number of

2

couplings (1.8) may in general be constructed since arbitrary powers of the
duals (which are zero forms) can appear.

the vertices (1.7) have a number of remarkable properties:

1. first, while the strictly gauge-invariant vertices may involve derivatives
of the individual components h (k)
1...pk +1 of the curvatures, the vertices
(1.8) are very special: they can be expressed as polynomials in the ex-
terior product (exterior polynomials) in the (undierentiated) forms
b(k), h (k) and h (k). this is not an extra requirement. rather, this
property follows directly from the demand that (1.7) denes a consis-
tent interaction.

2. if the vertices (1.7) do not involve the duals h (k), one recovers the fa-
miliar chern-simons terms [17]. these are o-shell gauge-invariant up
to a total derivative and so, do not deform the gauge transformations.
vertices (1.7) involving the duals are only on-shell gauge-invariant up to
a total derivative. these vertices do deform the gauge transformations.

3. although the vertices (1.7) deform the gauge symmetries when they
involve the duals h (k), they do not modify the algebra of the gauge
transformations (to the rst order in the coupling constants considered
here) because they are linear in the p-form potentials. this is in sharp
contrast with the yang-mills construction, which yields a vertex of the
form h a  bb  bc. there is thus no room for an analog of the yang-
mills vertex for exterior forms of degree  2. how the result is amended
in the presence of 1-forms will be discussed at the end.

4. the fact that the gauge transformations remain abelian to rst-order
in the coupling constant is not in contradiction with [18]. indeed, we
focus here only on symmetries of the equations of motion that are also
symmetries of the action. furthermore, the non-abelian structure un-
covered in [18] concerns symmetries associated with non-trivial global
features of the spacetime manifold, which are rigid symmetries [19].

the above theorem was stated and discussed in [1] but a complete demon-
stration of it was not given. the purpose of this paper is to ll this gap. as
we shall see, the proof has an interest in itself since it illustrates various
cohomologies arising in local eld theory.

3

we conclude this introduction by observing that the interaction vertices
are in general not duality-invariant, in the sense that an interaction vertex
that is available in one version of the theory may not be so in the dual version
where some of the p-form potentials are traded for dual (n  p  2)-form
potentials.

2 consistent interactions and local brst co-

homology

our approach to the problem of constructing consistent interaction vertices
for a gauge theory is based on the brst symmetry. as shown in [20, 21],
the question boils down to computing the local brst cohomological group
at ghost number zero in the algebra of local n-forms depending on the elds,
the ghosts, the antields and their derivatives. these groups are denoted by
h 0(s|d). the cocycle condition reads,

sa + db = 0,

(2.1)

where a (respectively b) is a local n-form (respectively (n  1)-form) of ghost
number zero (respectively one). trivial solutions of (2.1) are of the form,

a = sm + dn

(2.2)

where m (respectively n) is a local n-form (respectively, (n1)-form) of ghost
number 1 (respectively 0). one often refers to (2.1) as the wess-zumino
consistency condition [22].

if a is a solution of (2.1), its antield-independent part denes a consistent
interaction; and conversely, given a consistent interaction, one can complete
it it by antield-dependent terms to get a brst cocycle (2.1). as explained
in [20, 21], it is necessary to include the antields in the analysis of the
cohomology in order to cover symmetry-deforming interactions.

in the case at hand, the gauge symmetries are reducible and the following

set of antields is required [23, 24],

b a1...pa , b a1...pa1, . . . , b a1 , b a.

(2.3)

the grassmann parity and the antighost number of the antields b a1...pa
associated with the elds ba
are equal to 1. the grassmann parity and

1...pa

4

the antighost number of the other antields is determined according to the
following rule. as one moves from one term to the next one to its right in
(2.3), the grassmann parity changes and the antighost number increases by
one unit. therefore the parity and the antighost number of a given antield
b a1...paj are respectively j + 1 modulo 2 and j + 1.

reducibility also imposes the following set of ghosts,

c a
1...pa1, . . . , c a

1...paj

, . . . , c a.

(2.4)

these ghosts carry a degree called the pure ghost number. the pure ghost
number of c a
1...pa 1 and its grassmann parity are equal to 1. as one moves
from one term to the next one to its right in (2.4), the grassmann parity
changes and the ghost number increases by one unit up to pa.

we denote by p the algebra of spacetime forms with coecients that are

polynomials in the elds, antields, ghosts and their derivatives.

the action of s in p is the sum of two parts, namely, the koszul-tate

dierential  and the longitudinal exterior derivative :

where we have,

s =  + ,

in the above equations, c a

furthermore, we have systematically denoted (as above) the duals by an over-
line to avoid confusion with the *-notation of the antields. the actions of 
and  on the individual components of the antields (2.3), ghosts (2.4) and
their derivatives are easily read o from the above formulas (recalling that
(dx) = (dx) = 0, [, ] = 0, [, ] = 0).

3 general procedure for working out brst

cohomology

in order to prove the theorem, we shall solve the brst cocycle condition
by proceeding as in the yang-mills case [25, 26]. to that end, one expands
the cocycles and the cocycle condition according to the antighost number.
thus, if a is a brst cocycle (modulo d), then its various components in the
expansion,

a = a0 + a1 + a2 +    + ak, antigh(ai) = i,

(3.1)

must fulll the chain of equations,

a0 + a1 + db0 = 0,

...

ak1 + ak + dbk1 = 0,
ak + dbk = 0.

(3.2)

(3.3)
(3.4)

the last equation in this chain no longer involves the dierential  and can
be easily solved. the idea, then, is to start the resolution of the cocycle
condition from ak and to work ones way up until one reaches a0, which is the
quantity of physical interest. [recall that a0 denes a consistent deformation
of the lagrangian. and conversely, if a0 is a consistent deformation of the
lagrangian, then one may complete it by terms of positive antighost number,
as in (3.1), so as to construct a brst cocycle a. furthermore, trivial brst
cocycles (in the cohomological sense) correspond to trivial deformations (i.e.,
deformations that can be absorbed through redenitions of the eld variables)
[20, 21]. the reconstruction of the cocycle a from a0 stops at some antield
number k because a0 is polynomial in the derivatives (see the argument in
[26] section 3).

6

before doing this, we shall introduce some useful notations and give a few

solutions.

in the analysis of the brst cohomology, it turns out that two combina-
tions of the elds and antields play a central role. the rst one combines
the eld strengths and the duals of the antields and is denoted h a,

h a = h

a +

pa+1

xj=1

b

a
j .

(3.5)

the second one combines the pa-forms and their associated ghosts and is
denoted ba,

ba = ba + c a

1 + . . . + c a
pa.

(3.6)

it is easy to see that both h a and ba have a denite grassmann parity
respectively given by n  pa + 1 and pa modulo 2. on the other hand,
exterior products of h a or ba (including the h a and ba themselves) are not
homogeneous in form degree and ghost number. to isolate a component of a
given form degree k and ghost number g, we enclose the product in brackets
[. . .]k,g. the component in [a]k,g which has denite antighost number l is
denoted [a]k,g

.

since products of ba very frequently appear in the rest of the analysis,

l

we introduce the following notations,

qa1...am = ba1 . . . bam and qa1...am

k,g

= [ ba1 . . . bam]k
g .

(3.7)

we shall not write explicitly the wedge product from now on (dx0dx1 can
clearly only mean dx0  dx1).

we also dene the three mixed operators:  =  + d,  =  + d and

s = s + d.

using those denitions we have the following relations:

 h a = 0,  ba = 0, h a = 0
 h a = 0,
h a = 0
s h a = 0,
sh a = 0.

 ba = h a,
s ba = h a,

(3.8)
(3.9)
(3.10)

eq.  ba = h a is known in the literature as the horizontality condition
[13].

7

it is easy to construct solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition

out of the variables h a, h a, ba. for example, in ghost number zero,

an,0 = [pb(h a, h a) bb]n,0,

(3.11)

is a solution of (2.1). this can be seen by applying s to pb(h a, h a) bb.
one gets s(pb bb) = ()p pb(s bb) = ()p pbh b and thus, s[pb bb]n,0 +
d[pb bb]n1,1 = [s(pb bb)]n,1 = [pbh b]n,1 = 0 (no ghost occurs in pbh b). we
shall prove in this article the remarquable property that all antield depen-
dent solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition in ghost number
0 are in fact of the form (3.11) (modulo antield independent terms). ac-
cording to the discussion at the beginning of section 2, this is equivalent to
a)bb is of
proving theorem 1.1 since an,0
the required form.

0 = [pb(h a, h a) bb]n,0

0 = pb(h a, h

4 some useful lemmas

in order to construct the general solution of the (mod d) brst cocycle
condition along the lines indicated in the previous section, we shall need a
few lemmas.

lemma 4.1 let ak be a solution of ak + dbk = 0, with non-vanishing
k is an-
antighost number k. then one has ak = a
nihilated by , a

k + mk + dnk where a

k = 0.

proof: the proof proceeds as in the yang-mills case: one analyses the de-
scent equation associated with ak + dbk = 0. in [27] we have listed all the
non-trivial descents without taking into account the antields. however the
results are unchanged even if one includes the antields since their contri-
butions to non-trivial descents can always be absorbed by trivial terms (the
proof of this statement is identical to the one in the yang-mills case [26]).
therefore, if ak involves the antields, the descent associated with it is nec-
essarily trivial so that one can nd a dierent representative a
k in the same
class of h(|d) as ak which is annihilated by . 

8

lemma 4.2 the general solution of ak = 0 is given by,

ak = xi

p i
k i + ck,

(4.1)

pa and the p i

where the i are polynomials in the undierentiated last ghosts of ghosts
c a
k are spacetime n-forms with coecients that are polynomials
in the eld strengths, their derivatives, the antields and their derivatives
(these variables will be denoted  in the sequel).

proof: the proof of this lemma is quite standard. one redenes the variables
into three sets obeying respectively xi = 0, y = z, z = 0. the
variables y and z form contractible pairs and the cohomology is then
generated by the (independent) variables xi. in our case, the xi are given by
dx, the elds strengths components, the antields and their derivatives as
well as the last (undierentiated) ghosts of ghosts. a complete proof of the
lemma in the absence of antields can be found in [27]. here we simply note
that the antields are automatically part of the xi variables since they are
all -closed and do not appear in the  variations. 

using the conventions (3.7) and dropping the trivial term, we can write
qa1...am
,

the cocycle (4.1) as, ak = pm p a1...am
with l = pm pam.
lemma 4.3 let  be an antield independent -cocycle that takes the form

0,l

k

[ ba1 . . . bam]0,l = pm p a1...am

k

 = r1(h ar , c ar
par

)r2(h bs, c bs
pbs

), pbs > par ,

(4.2)

where r1 (respectively r2) is an exterior polynomial in the curvature form
h ar (respectively h bs) and the last ghost of ghost c ar
(respectively c bs
)
par
pbs
such that pbs > par . assume that r1 contains no constant term and is trivial
in h(|d),

r1 = u1 + dv1.

(4.3)

then,  is also trivial in h(|d).

proof: this result was proved in [27]. since r1 is trivial, it is the obstruction
to the lift of a -cocycle 1 through the descent equations of h(|d). because
of the condition pbs > par ,  then also appears as the obstruction to the lift
of the -cocycle 1r2 indicating that  is trivial in h(|d). 

9

the theorem applies in particular when r1 is an arbitrary polynomial of

degree > 0 in the curvatures h ar .

lemma 4.4 let a be a cochain with form-degree p and ghost number g,
a  [a]p,g, and let a = a0 + . . . + ak be its expansion according to the antighost
number, ai = [a]p,g
. assume that the last term ak takes the form ak =
k  where p is an exterior polynomial in h and h and where  
[p ]q,k
pq,k+g is an exterior polynomial in h and c a
pa which is trivial in h(|d),
(h, c) = m + dn. then one can redene ak away by adding s-exact terms
modulo d to a,

i

a = su + dv + terms of antighost number < k.

(4.4)

+ . . . + [p ]q,k

0

proof: one has p ( h, h) = [p ]qk,0

k + . . . + [p ]n,n+qk
and s p = 0. one has also by assumption,   pq,k+g = mpq,k+g1 +
dmpq1,k+g with mpq,k+g1  m and mpq1,k+g  n. if we dene mi,j (i <
p  q  1) through the descent equation mpq1,k+g + dmpq2,k+g+1 = 0, . . .
and m = mpq,k+g1+mpq1,k+g+mpq2,k+g+1+. . .+m0,k+g+pq1, one gets,
pq,k+g =  m  dmpq,k+g1 = s m  dmpq,k+g1. thus, s((1)p p m) =
ak  p dmpq,k+g1. if we project this equation on the form degree p of ak,
one nds the equation,

nq+k

sup,g1 + dup1,g = ak  [p ]q1,k+1

k1

dmpq,k+g1,

(4.5)

where we have set up,g1  [(1)p p m]p,g1 and up1,g  [(1)p p m]p1,g.
thus,

ak = sup,g1 + dup1,g + terms of antighost number < k,

(4.6)

which is the desired result. 

5 proof of theorem

we now have all the necessary tools required to solve the wess-zumino con-
sistency condition (2.1). consider rst the case where the expansion of a
(which has total ghost number 0) reduces to a0 (no antields). then, a  a0
fullls a0 + db0 = 0. this equation was investigated in detail in [27], where

10

it was shown that it has only two types of solutions: those for which one can
assume that b0 = 0, which are the strictly gauge-invariant terms; and those
for which no redenition yields b0 = 0 (semi-invariant terms), which are
exhausted by the chern-simons terms. both types of solutions preserve the
form of the gauge symmetries and are in agreement with the theorem; we
can thus turn to the case where a involves the antields, k 6= 0.

by lemma 4.1, one can assume that the last term ak in the expansion of a
is annihilated by . indeed, the (allowed) redenition a  asmk dnk (see
lemma 4.1) enables one to do so. then, the next to last equation in the chain
(3.2) implies dbk1, i.e., by the algebraic poincare lemma, bk1 + dck1 = 0
for some ck1 (the cohomology of d is trivial in form-degree n  1).

now, two cases must be considered: either k > 1, in which case lemma
4.1 implies again that one can assume bk1 = 0 through redenitions. or
k = 1, in which case bk1  b0 does not involve the antields and may lead
to a non trivial descent. this second possibility arises only if h() does not
vanish in pureghost number one since ak  a1 must be a non-trivial element
of h k() or else can be eliminated through a redenition. in the absence of 1-
forms, h 1() vanishes (lemma 4.2), so we can assume k > 1. the case k = 1
will be discussed in section 6 where we allow for the presence of 1-forms.

if k > 1, one can expand the elements ak and bk1 according to lemma

4.2,

ak = x p i

k i, bk1 = x qi

k1i

(5.1)

(-trivial terms can be eliminated). the next to last equation in the chain
(3.2) then implies

which indicates that p i

k is a cocycle of the cohomology h(|d).

p i

k + dqi

k1 = 0,

(5.2)

this cohomology, which is related to the so-called invariant characteristic
cohomology, was completely worked out in [5]. it was shown that all its rep-
resentatives can be written as the [ ]n,k component of an exterior polynomial
in h a and h a,

k = [p i(h a, h a)]n,k,
p i

(k > 1).

(5.3)

it is because of this property that antield dependent solutions of the wess-
zumino consistency condition, which belong a priori to the algebra generated
by all the variables and their individual, successive derivatives, turn out to
be expressible in terms of the forms h a, h a and ba only.

11

relation (5.3) implies that the term ak of highest antighost number in

the expansion of a is up to trivial terms of the form,

ak = [p i(h a, h a)]n,ki,

(5.4)

where the pureghost number of the i must be equal to k in order to obtain
a brst cocycle in ghost number 0.

the question is now: can we construct from the known higher-order com-
ponent ak the components aj of lower antighost numbers in order to obtain
a solution of the wess-zumino consistency condition?

as we have seen in section 3 this is always possible when the i are linear
in the ghosts of ghosts and the resulting brst cocyle is then given by (3.11).
we are now going to show that when the i in ak are at least quadratic in
the ghosts of ghosts then one encounters an obstruction in the construction
of the corresponding solution of the wess-zumino consistency condition.

to proceed we exhibit explicitly in ak the ba which correspond to the
1 . the form
2 . thus we write

forms of lowest degree occuring in ak and denote them by bai
degree in question is called p. the other ba are denoted bbj
ak as,

ak = [pa1...arb1...bs]n,k[ ba1

(5.5)
of course, k > p (ak is at least quadratic in the b). in fact, k > p + 1 since
there is no 1-form in the problem.

a direct calculation then shows that the equations aj + aj+1 + dbj = 0

determining ak1, ak2, . . . have a solution up to akp. these solutions are,

akj = [pa1...arb1...bs]nj,k+j[ ba1

1 . . . bar

for 0  j  p.

(5.6)

unless ak is trivial (i.e., can be removed by the addition of exact terms to a),
there is however an obstruction in the construction of akp1. to discuss this
obstruction, one needs to know the ambiguity in the akj (0  j  p). one
easilly veries that it is given by akj  akj + m0 + m1 + . . . + mj1 where
m0 satises m0 = 0, m1 satises m1 + n1 + db1 = 0, n1 = 0, m2 satises
m2 + n2 + db2 = 0, n2 + l2 + dc2 = 0, l2 = 0, etc. however, none
of these ambiguities except m0 in akp can play a role in the construction
of a non-trivial solution. to see this, we note that ,  and d conserve the

12

polynomial degree of the variables of any given sector2. we can therefore
work at xed polynomial degree in the variables of all the dierent p-forms.
since n1, l2, etc. are -closed terms which can be lifted at least once, they
have the generic form r[h, h]q where q has to contain a ghost of ghost of
degree pa < p. because we work at xed polynomial degree, the presence of
such terms imply that pa1...arb1...bs has to depend on h a (a dependence on
h a is not possible since by assumption k > p). however, ak is then of the
form described in lemma 4.4 and can be eliminated from a by the addition
of trivial terms and the redenition of the terms of antighost numbers < k.
therefore we may now assume that ak does not contain h a and that the
only ambiguity in the denitions of the akj is m0 in akp.

since k > p, we have to substitute akp in the equation akp1 + akp +

dbkp1 = 0. we then get,

by acting with  on the above equation we obtain db
kp1 +
kp1 is a  mod d cocycle. because we

have excluded 1-forms from the discussion, k  p  1 > 0 so that we may

kp1 is strictly annihilated by . accordingly, db

since  and d both increase the number of derivatives of the . let us
rst note that pa1...arb1...bs cannot depend on h c
1 because in that case we
would have k  p  1  0 which contradicts our assumption that there
is no 1-form (indeed, the component of form-degree n of a polynomial in
h a and h a which depends on h c
1 has maximum antighost number p + 1).
therefore, pa1...ar b1...bs will satisfy (5.11) only if it is of the form, pa1...arb1...bs =
rca1...arb1...bsh c
1 with rca1...arb1...bs symmetric in c  a1 (resp. antisymmetric)
if h1 is anticommuting (resp. commuting). however, using lemma 4.4 we
conclude once more that in that case ak can be absorbed by the addition of
trivial terms and a redenition of the components of lower antighost number
of a. this ends our proof of the statement that for a system of p-forms with
p  2 all the antield dependent solutions of the wess-zumino consistency
conditions in ghost number 0 are of the form (3.11).

6 presence of 1-forms

if 1-forms are present in the system of p-forms considered, the solutions in
theorem 1.1 are still valid. however, new solutions of the wess-zumino
consistency condition appear, so the list is no longer exhaustive.

the rst set of new solutions, related to the noether conserved currents
of the theory, arise because h 1() no longer vanishes. although the term
bk1  b0 which appears in (5.1) may lead to a non-trivial descent, one can
show that (5.2) still holds [26, 28] so that p i  p a has to be an element of
1 (|d). this cohomology is isomorphic to the set a of non-trivial global
h n
symmetries of the theory. the corresponding solutions of the wess-zumino
consistency condition can then be written as,

a = ka

1 ),

(jba

1 + ac a

(6.1)

where the j are the noether currents corresponding to the a and sat-
isfy a + dj = 0. the dimension of this set of solutions is innite since
one can construct innitely many conserved currents j [5]. this feature is
characteristic of free lagrangians. although these solutions dene consistent
interactions to rst order in the deformation parameter, it is expected that
most of them are obstructed at the second order. furthermore, they are
severely constrained by lorentz invariance.

the second set of new solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition
arise because the condition k  p  1 > 0 under (5.9) may no longer hold.
indeed, if p = 1 and k = 2 then we have k  p  1 = 0. as above, the
term b
0 appearing in (5.9) may now lead to a non-trivial descent in
h(|d). according to the analysis of [27], equation (5.11) is then replaced
by,

kp1  b





()p r[pa1...arb1...bs(h a, h a)]n2

1 + va2...arb1...bs(h a) = 0.
the only solution of the above equation for p i is p i  kabc h a
1 with kabc
completely antisymmetric [26, 28]. the corresponding brst cocyles are
given by,

0 h a1

(6.2)

they give rise to the famous yang-mills vertex since a0 = kabch

in particular, the above discussion conrms that is not possible to con-
struct a lagrangian with coloured p-forms (p > 1) since vertices of the form
a0  hba (where a is a 1-form potential) do not exist. this fact is well
appreciated in the litterature.

7 comments and conclusions

in this paper we have provided the complete proof of the theorem given
in [1] on the consistent deformations of non-chiral free p-forms. the same
techniques can be used to study solutions of the wess-zumino consistency
condition at other ghost numbers (e.g., candidate anomalies) [28]. for in-
stance, one can show that if all the exterior gauge elds have form degree
 3, theorem 1.1 is also valid for candidate anomalies (the gauge potential
being replaced by the corresponding ghosts of pure ghost number 1).

the same methods have also been extended recently to cover chiral p-

forms [29].
