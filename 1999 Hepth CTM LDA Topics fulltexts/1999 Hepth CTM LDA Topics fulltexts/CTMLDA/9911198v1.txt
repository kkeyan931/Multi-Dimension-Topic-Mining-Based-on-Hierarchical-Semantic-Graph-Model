abstract. the eective hamiltonian introduced many years ago by bloch and gener-
alized later by wilson, appears to be the ideal starting point for hamiltonian perturba-
tion theory in quantum eld theory. the present contribution derives the blochwilson
hamiltonian from a generalization of the gell-mannlow theorem, thereby enabling a
diagrammatic analysis of hamiltonian perturbation theory in this approach.

the presently available techniques for calculations in quantum eld theory re-
ect the dominance of scattering processes for the experimental exploration of the
physics of elementary particles. the single most important technique is beyond
doubt lagrangian perturbation theory, the explicit covariance of which has his-
torically played an important role in the implementation of the renormalization
program. this in turn was the crucial ingredient for converting the formal expres-
sions of lagrangian perturbation theory into predictions for measurable quantities.
on the other hand, the identication of physical states dened as eigenstates of the
hamiltonian and the hilbert space they span, becomes a complicated task in this
approach, which is exemplied by the serious problems arising in the solution of the
bethesalpeter equation. in short, lagrangian perturbation theory is primarily a
theory of processes as opposed to a theory of states.

this contribution is concerned with the development of a theory of states, estab-
lishing ecient techniques for hamiltonian perturbation theory. apart from the
possibility of gaining a new perspective on the foundations of quantum eld theory,
this approach appears to be natural for the description of hadronic structure and of
bound state phenomena in general. in a very general setting, consider the problem
of solving the schrodinger equation

h|i = e|i

for the state |i. the hamiltonian is supposed to be decomposable into a free
and an interacting part, h = h0 + hi, where the eigenstates of h0 are explicitly
known and span the full hilbert space (or fock space) f , which we picture as a
direct sum of free nparticle subspaces (n  0). the eigenstates of h are expected
to be representable as (innite) linear combinations of the eigenstates of h0, hence
the schrodinger equation (1) can be written in a fock space basis, where in gen-
eral an innite number of nparticle subspaces are involved. the problem in this
generality is obviously too dicult to be solved in practice.

restricting attention momentarily to the vacuum state, the gell-mannlow the-
orem [1] states that the free (fock space) vacuum evolves dynamically into the
physical vacuum as h0 turns adiabatically into h. explicit expressions can then
be given for the physical vacuum state and its energy in terms of the free nparticle
states and their energies in the form of a perturbative series. it is natural to ask
whether it is possible to generalize the theorem to the case where the perturbative
vacuum is replaced by a linear subspace  of f consisting of eigenspaces of h0, i.e.
h0  , the simplest nontrivial example being the free twoparticle subspace
of f . when the interaction hi is switched on adiabatically, one may expect that
 evolves into the suspace of interacting physical twoparticle states, where now
dierent eigenstates of h0 are allowed to mix during the adiabatic process. if this
expectation comes true, the determination of the physical twoparticle states may
be reduced to a problem within the free twoparticle subspace, thus dramatically
reducing the number of degrees of freedom to be considered and converting the
problem into a (at least numerically) solvable one.

couched into mathematical jargon, what one is looking for is a map ubw from
 to a direct sum of eigenspaces of h, i.e. hubw   ubw , where ubw is
expected to be related to the adiabatic evolution operator. one would then hope
that ubw induces a similarity transformation, so that the problem of diagonalizing
h in ubw  is equivalent to diagonalizing hbw := u 1
bw hubw :   , which in
the example above is equivalent to a relativistic twoparticle schrodinger equation.
the simplest (but not unique) choice for u 1
bw : ubw    is the orthogonal
projector p to ,3 hence we will look for an operator ubw in  with

p ubw = p = 1 .

(2)

eq. (2) implies in turn the injectivity of ubw , hence also ubw p = 1 in ubw .
together with hubw   ubw  one then has that

(1  ubw p )hubw = 0 in  .

(3)

eqs. (2) and (3) together in fact characterize ubw :
(3) implies hubw  =
ubw (p hubw )  ubw . consequently, h|ubw  is diagonalizable, and by (2)
it is a similarity transform of hbw .

3) that the choice of p for the similarity transformation is not unreasonably simple is suggested
by phenomenology: even in the highly nonperturbative situation of lowenergy qcd the physical
hadrons can be associated with a specic content of constituent quarks (and thus with an element
of the free two or threeparticle subspace).

remarkably, eqs. (2) and (3) also determine ubw uniquely, at least within the

perturbative regime. to see this, rewrite (3) as

hiubw  ubw p hiubw = ubw p h0ubw  h0ubw

= ubw h0  h0ubw ,

(4)

where i have used p h0ubw = h0p ubw = h0. now consider the matrix element of
(4) between hu| and |ki, where |ki   and |ui   (the orthogonal complement
of  in f ) are eigenstates of h0 with eigenvalues ek and eu, respectively,

hu|hiubw  ubw p hiubw |ki = (ek  eu)hu|ubw |ki .

(5)

it then follows that

ubw = p + (1  p )ubw p

= p +z
= p +z

(6)

where i have taken k and u to label the eigenstates of h0 in  and , respectively.
eq. (6) can be solved iteratively to obtain ubw as a power series in hi. it should be
emphasized, however, that the individual terms in the series are not guaranteed to
give convergent expressions (let alone the series as a whole). this depends, among
other things, on the choice of .

eqs. (2) and (3) have been used for the characterization of ubw before, rst by
bloch [2] in the context of degenerate quantum mechanical perturbation theory,
and later by wilson [3] for the formulation of a nonperturbative renormalization
group in minkowski space.
in practical applications, one will calculate ubw to
a certain order in the iterative expansion of (6) and solve the schrodinger equa-
tion for the corresponding hamiltonian hbw = p hubw . its solution yields an
approximation to the eigenvalues of h|ubw  (the eigenvalues are invariant under
similarity transformations) and also to the eigenstates via |i = ubw |i where |i
are the eigenstates of hbw . the solutions will in general also include bound states
(e.g., if  is the free twoparticle subspace), in contrast to lagrangian perturba-
tion theory. the reason for this dierence is that although in the present formalism
hbw is determined perturbatively, the corresponding schrodinger equation can be
solved exactly (at least to arbitrary precision with numerical methods). this is
somewhat analogous to the bethesalpeter equation, but avoids the conceptual
problems associated with the latter. in this context, it is worth mentioning that
the normalizability of the free twoparticle component |i = p |i gives a natural
criterium for the boundedness of the state |i, although the latter may not be
normalizable in the hilbert space sense.

the formulation presented so far has two important shortcomings: rst, the
terms in the perturbative series following from (6) are not welldened in the case

of vanishing energy denominators, and a consistent prescription is at least not
obvious from (3) or (6). second, it is not a priori clear how to translate the terms
in the perturbative series into diagrams. a diagrammatic formulation, however,
is expected to be at least helpful, if not imperative, for the investigation of such
important properties as renormalizability and lorentz and gauge invariance at nite
orders of the expansion, as well as for practical applications of the formalism.

in search of an alternative characterization of ubw , i will now return to the idea
of the adiabatic evolution. consider the adiabatic evolution operator from t = 
to t = 0,

u = t exp iz 0
z 0

(i)n

n!



=



xn=0

dt e|t|hi(t)

dt1   z 0



dtn e(|t1|+...+|tn|) t [hi(t1)    hi(tn)] ,

(7)



where

hi(t) = eih0thi eih0t

(8)

is the usual expression in the interaction picture and t stands for the decreasing
time ordering operator. then the following theorem holds:

generalized gell-mannlow theorem. with the notations introduced before,
suppose that the operator ubw := lim0 u(p up )1 exists in . then it has the
properties p ubw = p and (1  ubw p )hubw = 0 in .

remarks. we thus have an explicit expression for ubw in terms of the adiabatic
evolution operator. given that p up is always formally invertible as a power series
in hi, the implications of the theorem rest on the existence of the limit   0 of
u(p up )1, which in turn depends on the choice of .

proof. the property p ubw = p follows directly from the denition of ubw .
the rst part of the proof of (1ubw p )hubw = 0 is identical to the original gell-
mannlow proof [1] and will not be reproduced here. it establishes by manipulation
of the series (7) for u that (before taking the limit   0)

hu = uh0 + ig


g

u ,

(9)

where hi is assumed to be proportional to some coupling constant g.

now choose any |i  . eq. (9) implies

hu(p up )1|i = uh0(p up )1|i + i g


g

u! (p up )1|i .

(10)

it follows that

hu(p up )1|i  ig



g (cid:16)u(p up )1(cid:17) |i

= uh0(p up )1|i + iu(p up )1 p g

= u(p up )1p hu(p up )1|i ,


g

u! (p up )1|i

(11)

(12)

where in going from (11) to (12) eq. (10) has been used again, multiplied by
u(p up )1p from the left, and p has been inserted to the left of h0, which
is possible due to h0  . taking the limit   0, we have hubw |i =
ubw p hubw |i, which proves the theorem. in taking the limit, the existence of the
gderivative of ubw in  has been assumed. incidentally, this assumption implies
that the expression u(g /g)(p up )1|i is in general divergent in the limit  
0, since hu(p up )1|i cannot be expected to be equal to uh0(p up )1|i in
this limit [1].

the theorem corroborates the expectation detailed at the beginning of this con-
tribution. more importantly, the adiabatic formulation also has the benet of xing
an iprescription for the energy denominators appearing in the series generated
by (6). performing the time integrations in u(p up )1 yields explicitly to second
order in hi

ubw = z

where the limit   0 is understood. the same expression without the i
prescription follows from iterating (6).

the second important advantage of the formulation in terms of u is the ready
translation into diagrams. the diagrams associated with the perturbative expan-
sion of hbw turn out to be similar to goldstone or timeordered diagrams, but
unlike the latter they do not combine into a set of feynman diagrams. this is
essentially due to the fact that the matrix elements of the eective hamiltonian
hk|hubw |ki in general do not vanish if the energies ek and ek are dierent.
