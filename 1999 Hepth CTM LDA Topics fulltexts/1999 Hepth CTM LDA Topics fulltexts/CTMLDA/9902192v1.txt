we consider here xxz spin chain perturbed by the op-
erator x (in transverse eld) which is a lattice regular-
ization of the sine-gordon model. this can be shown using
conformal perturbation theory. we calculated mass ratios
of particles which lie in a discrete part of the spectrum and
obtained results in accord with the dhn formula and in dis-
agreement with recent calculations in literature based on nu-
merical bethe ansatz and innite momentum frame methods.
we also analysed a short distance behavior of this states (uv
or conformal limit). our result for conformal dimension of
the second breather state is dierent from the conjecture in
[klassen and melzer, int. j. mod. phys. a 8, 4131 (1993)]
and is consistent whith this paper for other states.

i. introduction

the sine-gordon (sgm) and massive thirring (mtm)
models in two dimensions belong to a group of the most
studied qfts and are certainly the best understood non-
trivial massive eld theories. a large number of dierent
techniques have been successfully tested on these models
and they led us to a number of interesting results, includ-
ing the famous duality relation between them [13].

regarding a mass spectrum, we can classify all meth-
ods in basicaly three groups: (a) the semi-classical dhn
method [4], (b) factorized scattering theory [5] and (c)
methods based on bethe ansatz, which can be further
subdivided in continuum ones [6,7] and in discrete ones
[8,9] (some lattice regularizations were used). results of
all methods were the same; beside soliton and antisoli-
ton (fermion and antifermion in mtm language) there
are bound states (breathers) and their masses are given
by:

mn = 2m sin

n2

2(8  2)

, n = 1, 2, . . . <

8
2  1 (1.1)

where m is the soliton mass and  is the coupling con-
stant in sgm (see (2.1)). because of the colemans the-
orem of equivalence between the sgm and the mtm in
soliton number (charge) zero sector (proved using per-
turbative expansion in mass), the same spectrum should
be valid for the mtm. using standard conventions (as in
[1]), a connection (duality relation) between  and the
mtm coupling constant g0 (in the schwinger normaliza-
tion) is given by:

1 +

g0


=

4
2

however, recently appeared claims [1012] that mass
spectrum of the mtm is dierent than (1.1) and that
there is only one breather in the whole interval g0 > 0
(for negative values of g0 fermion and antifermion repel
each other and there are no bound states, like in (1.1)).
in [10], using the innite momentum frame technique and
working only in q q sector of the fock space (neglecting
qq q q and higher fermion components), authors obtained
the mass of the (only) breather:

m = 2m cos 

(1.2)

where the parameter 0   < /2 is obtained by solving
equation:

tan 

2  

=

g

 (cid:20)1 +

1

cos2 (cid:16)1 

g

4(cid:17)(cid:21)

and g is the mtm coupling constant in johnsons nor-
malization which is connected to that in schwingers nor-
malization by:

g0 =

2g
2  g



afterwards, in [11] authors reexamined an analysis of
[6], but contrary to [6] they numericaly solved bethe
ansatz equations for a nite space extension and a nite
number of quasi-particles, and after that made an ex-
trapolation to innity. their analysis conrmed results
of [10]; they found only one breather, with the mass in
good agreement with (1.2).

in this paper we propose ourselves to calculate certain
properties of the sgm like mass ratios and scaling dimen-
sions of operators creating particle states. using the con-
formal perturbation theory [13,14] it can be shown that
xxz spin chain with an even number of sites and peri-
odic boundary conditions in a transverse magnetic eld
(x perturbation) is spin chain regularization of the sgm
(see appendix b in [14]). we numericaly diagonalize the
spin chain hamiltonian up to 16 sites and extrapolate re-
sults to innite lenght continuum limit using the bst ex-
trapolation algorithm [15,16]. the same method was pre-
viously applied to conformal unitary models perturbed
by some relevant (usually termal) operator [1719]. in
this way we can obtain estimates of mass ratios with-
out further assumptions, particularly those criticized in
[1012].

results of our analysis are as follows. for a whole range

of the coupling constants we can cover (0 <   2) our

results agree with the dhn formula (1.1) and disagree
with (1.2), i.e. results of [10,11]. of course, we couldnt
say anything about breathers higher then third because
they lie in a continuum part of the spectrum (mn > 2m1
for n  3). we should also say that precision in this
method is far from that achieved by, e.g. bethe ansatz
methods, so we cant claim that dhn formula is exact.
finaly, as a by product, we studied uv limit of par-
ticle states. it agrees with that conjectured in [14] for
(anti)soliton and rst breather. however, for the second
breather we obtain the same scaling dimension as for the
rst, contrary to [14].

ii. the sgm as a massive perturbation

so that its scaling dimension and (lorentz) spin are:

+

m22

n2

+ (nr)2 =

2r(cid:17)2
dm,n = m,n + m,n =(cid:16) m
sm,n = m,n  m,n = mn
it is understood that vm,n are normalized so that
hvm,n(z, z)vm,n(0, 0)i = m,mm,mz2m,n z2 m,n
because of v 
m,n = vm,n, we can dene hermitian com-
binations

(vm,n + vm,n)

(vm,n  vm,n)

of the gaussian model

which will be usefull later.

the sgm is a 1 + 1 dimensional eld theory of a pseu-

doscalar eld , dened classically by the lagrangian:

lsg =

1
2

 +  cos()

(2.1)

here  is a mass scale (with mass dimension depending
on a regularization scheme),  is a dimensionless coupling
(which does not renormalize) and one identies eld con-
gurations that dier by a period 2/ of the potential
(because we want to have ordinary qft with a unique
vacuum).

in [14] it was shown that sgm can be viewed as a
perturbed cft when second term in (2.1) is treated as
a (massive) perturbation. well now repeat here relevant
results of their analyses.

an unperturbed theory  = 0 (approached in uv
limit) is the free massless compactied pseudoskalar cft
(known as gaussian model).
it is conventional to use

  , so that the radius of compactication r, de-
ned by equivalence    + 2r is connected to  with

(2.2)




r =

solution of the equation of motion in euclidean space,
 (z, z) = 0, is

(z, z) =

( + )

1
2

the gaussian model is a cft with central charge c = 1
and an operator algebra generated by the primary elds
vm,n

vm,n = : ei m

,

in [14] it is argued that an uv limit of the sgm is

generated by

lb = {vm,n|m, n  z}

(2.5)

we suppose that hilbert space of the full (perturbed)
theory is isomorphic to that of the unperturbed theory.
from (2.2) and (2.3) follows that a (properly normalized)
perturbing operator in the sgm (2.1) is

cos() = v (+)
1,0

(2.6)

which means that  has mass dimension y = 2d1,0 = 2
2
4 . from the condition of relevancy of the perturbation,
i.e. y > 0, we obtain colemans bound 2 < 8. also,
from (2.5) and (2.6) we can see that sgm has u(1)z2
z2 internal symmetry group. the u (1) acts as shift on
, i.e. vm,n  einvm,n, while z2 and z2 are generated
by r : (, )  (, ) (i.e. vm,n  vm,n) and r :
(, )  (, ) (i.e. vm,n  vm,n), respectively.
to conclude this section, consider the sgm dened
on a cilinder with innite time dimension and space ex-
tension equal to l. there are three independent con-
stants with which we can express all quantities in the
theory, ,  and l with mass dimensions d = 0,
d = 2  d1,0 = 2  2/(4) and dl = 1. it is use-
full to dene dimensionless scaling parameter 

  ld = l2 2

4

(2.7)

and use ,  and  as a set of independent parameters.
now, from ordinary dimensional analysis follows that any
quantity x in the theory, with mass dimension dx , can
be written as

x = 

dx
d gx(, ) = 

dx

2

2
4 gx (, )

(2.8)

where gx is the scaling function connected to x. we see
that all dimensionless quantities depend only on  and
. especially, we have for masses of particles:

2

mi(, , ) = (2 2

4 )1

gi(, )

(2.9)

now, there are two interesting limits. the rst one is the
innite lenght limit, l  , which is equal to   
(see (2.7)). we are interested here in mass ratios:

ri() = lim


mi+1(, , )
m1(, , )

= lim


gi+1(, )
g1(, )

the second interesting limit is the uv limit given by
l  0 (  0). basic assumption of conformal pertur-
bation theory is that the perturbed qft should aproach
smoothly to cft in uv limit. it means that if we write
(2.8) in the form:

x = xcf t (, l) + 

dx
d hx (, )

(2.10)

where xcf t is the value for x in conformal point
( = 0), than a taylor expansion for dx /dhx (, )
around  = 0 will have nite radius of convergence and
hx (, 0) = 0. specially, for the mass gaps we have well-
known formula:

(mi)cf t =

2
l

di

where di is the scaling dimension of the operator which
creates that state from the vacuum. now from (2.9),
(2.10) and (2.7) follows:

mi(, , ) =

2
l

di +

d h2di 1
4 )1(cid:20)2di(2 2

4 )1

(2.11)

+ hi(, )(cid:21)

= (2 2

now, what are scaling dimensions of zero-momentum
one-particle states in sgm, i.e. of soliton, antisoliton and
breathers? in table i we show values conjectured in [14].
in sec. v well show that we obtain a dierent result for
the second breather.

iii. spin chain regularization of the

sgm

it was proposed (appendix b in [14] ) that xxz spin
chain with periodic boundary conditions in a transverse
magnetic eld dened by the hamiltonian:

n

nx

n+1 + y

ny

n+1 + z

nz

n+1 + hx

h = 

xn=1(cid:0)x

n(cid:1)

(3.1)

~n +1  ~1

where a are pauli matrices, n is an even integer, 1 
 < 1 (we use the usual parametrization  =  cos ,
0   < ), is a spin chain regularization of the sgm.

3

the argument has two steps; rst one must show that
unperturbed theories are equivalent, i.e. that (3.1) with
h = 0 is a spin chain regularization of lb cft (2.5), and
second that in the unperturbed theory (h = 0) perturba-
tion operator x

n is a lattice regularization of v (+)

1,0 (x).

for a rst step one must take h = 0 in (3.1), i.e. to

consider periodic xxz spin chain

n

hxxz = 

xn=1(cid:0)x

nx

n+1 + y

ny

n+1 + z

nz

n+1(cid:1)

~n +1  ~1
hxxz commutes with sz = 1/2pn
n. we denote
eigenvalues of sz by q. q is integer (half-odd integer)
when n is even (odd) and n/2  q  n/2. hxxz is
also translation-invariant where translations by one site
are generated by:

n=1 z

(3.2)

t =



n 1

yn=1

1
2

(~n  ~n+1 + 1)

(3.3)

and we dene (lattice) momentum operator by t =
exp(ip ). from (3.3) follows that t n = 1, so eigen-
values pk of the lattice momentum p are given by:

pk =

2
n

k,

k = 0, 1, . . . , n  1

(3.4)

obviously, pk are dened mod 2.

now, in [20] it has been shown that energy-momentum
spectrum of the periodic xxz chain in charge sector q
has following asimptotic form for large n :

where   z, n, n  n0, central charge c = 1, q, 
{0, 1}, and conformal dimensions n

given by

2(cid:20) q

(3.6)
where compactication radius is r = [2(1  /)]1/2.
from (3.5) and (3.6) we can infer that continuum limit
of hxxz dened by:

h cont

(3.7a)

(3.7b)

(a is lattice constant and l = n a is kept xed) denes
c = 1 cft, and in fact contains lb of the gaussian

model as we shall see. in (3.7b)  is an operator which
project states having nonuniversal macroscopic momen-
tum equal to  (see [22]). we shall comment more on
this at the end of this section.  is a normalization factor
and e is (c-number) nonuniversal bulk energy density.
nonuniversal quantities are subtracted in qft limit.

let us see how one can obtain lb and lf from h cont

xxz.

first, from (3.6) and it is obvious that

(cid:0)0

q,, 0

q,(cid:1) =(cid:0)q,, q,(cid:1)

where m,n and m,n are conformal dimensions (2.4) of
the vertex operator vm,n in gaussian model. comparing
(3.6) with (2.5), it is obvious that q must be integer, so
n must be even, and

lb(cid:18)r =h2(cid:16)1 



(cid:17)i 1

2(cid:19)  h cont

xxz ()

(3.8)

so, in (3.8) is given the rst half of equivalence be-
tween (3.1) and the sgm, that unperturbed cfts are
equivalent. now one must show the second part, that
operator x
1,0 (x) (x = na) in
the gaussian model. in [23] it was shown (in the leading
order in the lattice constant a) that:

n is lattice counterpart of v (+)

n  ad1,0v1,0(x) = a


2
4 v1,0(x)

where x = na. the constant of proportionality in (3.9)
is in fact known [24,25] but well not need it here. so,
from (3.9) we see that:

n  v (+)
x

1,0 (x)

x = na

(3.10)

in the leading order. that nally completes the argument
[14] that hamiltonian (3.1) is a spin chain regularization
of the sgm where connection between coupling constants
is


r

 =

=p2(  )

(3.11)

let us made a comment on internal symmetries of con-
tinuum and lattice models. as we emphasized in the last
section sgm posesses z2  z2  u (1) symmetry and is
integrable. but spin chain (3.1) is only symmetric on z2
generated by charge conjugation operator c:

c =

x
n

n

yn=1

and in fact is believed to be non-integrable. that spin
chain representation of a qft has less symmetries is not
something new [17].

now, what are the relations between dimensionfull pa-
rameters (l, , ) in the (continuum) sgm and param-
eters (n , h) in (lattice) (3.1). from (3.7a) and (3.8)
follows

4

(3.9)

from (2.9), (3.12), (3.14) and (3.15) we can see that:

hsgm (l) =

1


lim

n
a=l/n

h
a

so, if we denote by mi mass gaps in the spin chain, we
have:

mi(l) =

1


lim

n
a=l/n

mi
a

also, from (3.10) we have:

h  lim

a0

ad = lim
a0

a2 2

4

(3.12)

(3.13)

where factor of proportionality is nite. of course, we
have l = n a and  xed. we can see from (3.13) that
h  0 because d > 0. we can now express scaling
parameter  using lattice constants:

 = ld  lim

n

l, finite

hn d

(3.14)

constant of proportionality is not important for us be-
cause we are interested here only in l   (  )
and l  0 (  0) limits. if we dene now

  hn d = hn 2 2

4 = hn

3

2 + 

2

(3.15)

mi = h(2 2

4 )1 gi(, )

(3.16)

where  is connected to  by (3.11). strictly speaking,
scaling law (3.15) should be exactly valid only in the
continuum limit n  , a  0 and h  0 where l =
2
4 2 are kept xed. for nite n (3.15)
n a and   ha
is only aproximate and we expect that scaling is worser
for n smaller.

* * *

to keep our promise, we shall now comment subtrac-
tion of nonuniversal momentum  mentioned in the
part of the text following eq. (3.7b), which doesnt sound
very natural (maybe too statistical). a more natural
explanation is based on the fact that sgm is equivalent
to (3.1) when number of lattice sites n is even. lets
suppose that lattice is staggered, i.e. that (in continuum
limit terms) real space translations are given by trans-
lations by even number of sites, and translation by one
site is some internal state transformation [26]. a conse-
quence is that t 2 is the real lattice translation opera-
tor, so 2p is the real momentum which is also dened
mod2. but, now we must multiply (3.5b) by 2, so how
can we obtain the same conformal dimensions  and .
an explanation is that the continuum spatial extension
of the system is now l = an/2, so we must put n/2 in
place of n in (3.5a). in (3.5b) it just compensates factor
2, and in (3.5a) we already needed scaling factor  which
should be now halved.

iv. mass spectrum

now we are ready to calculate particle mass-ratios in
sgm l   limit using connection with spin chain
(3.1). first we must numericaly calculate mass gaps of
spin chain for nite n and h. then we must make con-
tinuum limit, i.e. take n   keeping l = n a and 
xed (obviously a  0 and from (3.15) h  0). finally
we should make l  , i.e.    (see (3.14)) limit.
in practice, it is preferable to do following [1719]; rst
take n   with h xed and afterwords extrapolate
to h  0. a dierence is that in latter case one does
   before h  0. this limits are performed using
bst extrapolation method [15,16].
we numericaly diagonalized hamiltonian (3.1) for up
to 16 sites using lanczos algorithm. but before doing nu-
merics, one should maximally exploite symmetries. the
hamiltonian (3.1) commutes with translation operator
t (given by (3.3)) and with charge conjugation opera-
tor c. so, we can break hamiltonian (3.1) in blocks,
each marked with eigenvalues of the operators p = i ln t
and c which can be pk = 2i
n k mod 2, (see (3.4)) and
c = 1 (because c2 = 1). we are interested in mass
ratios, so we only need zero-momentum sector. but, be-
cause true space translations are generated by t 2 (or
because we must subtract nonuniversal macroscopic mo-
mentum , if you like it more) zero-momentum sector
is a union of p = 0 and p =  sectors. so we must
diagonalize four blocks which we will denote by 0+, 0,
+ and .

we considered a number of values of coupling 1 
 < 1 (or 2   > 0, see (3.11)). starting from
 = 1 spectrum contains ve clearly isolated states:
vacuum and second breather in 0+, rst breather in
0, soliton in  and antisoliton in +. all other lev-
els form continuum,
i.e. they densely ll the re-
gion between  2  (mass of rst breather) and some
emax. soliton and antisoliton energies are not degen-
erate which is a consequence of breaking z2 symmetry
on the spin chain. exactly at  = 1 we have [27]
mb1 = ms < ma < mb2. as we increase  ms, ma and
mb2 monotonicaly increase (relative to mb1) where ms
and ma increase faster than mb2 and at   0.1 dis-
appear into the continuum (i.e. ms,a > 2 mb1 ), while
mb2 asimptoticaly aproach 2 mb1. this was a crude pic-
ture visible already from row data before extrapolation
n   and h  0, and it is expected from the dhn
formula (1.1). observe that the exact degeneracy of soli-
ton and rst breather masses at  = 1 is present in
(1.1).
1-3 we present numerical resuls for the
scaled gaps (scaling functions of mass gaps) ga, a 
{s, a, b1, b2} at  = 0.9,0.6,0.1. this is of
course check of the scaling relation (3.16). bst ex-
trapolations n   (with xed h) of scaled gaps for
h = 0.8, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2 are given in tables ii-iv. as ex-
pected convergence is better for higher .

in figs.

to make an extrapolation h  0 one should obtain
results for smaller h, at least h = 0.1. from figs. 1-3 one
can see that for that one should diagonalize hamiltonian
with n  26, which is too demanding even for most
powerfull machines today.

finally, (partialy) extrapolated mass ratios

ra(, h) = lim

are given in tables v-ix together with the predictions
from dhn formula (1.1) and fujita et al. formula (1.2).
one can see that our results conrm dhn and reject
fujita et al.

v. uv (conformal) limit of particle

states

lets now turn our attention to the opposite uv limit
of our results for the spin chain (3.1). we saw in sec.
ii that it is obtained when ()  0. using (3.12) and
(3.15) in the continuum result (2.11) we obtain that the
scaling relation for mass gaps of spin chain should have
form

ma(, , h) = h

2

3+ h2da  2

3+ + ha(, )i

where we must now include proper normalization factor
 for the spin chain hamiltonian. because it doesnt
depend on h we can take it from unperturbed xxz spin
chain (3.2), where it is well known

 =

 sin 



before we plot reduced scaling functions ha(, ) we
must know scaling dimension da of the corresponding
state. on the other hand, we can choose da and see
does it gives the right behaviour of ha(, ) when   0
(which is the same as for ha mentioned below (2.10)).
in table i we have presented scaling dimensions of
zero-momentum particle states of sgm as conjectured
in [14]. but our numerical results clearly indicate that
rst and second breather (b2 and b2) have exactly the
same scaling dimensions. in figs. 4-6 we show numeric
results for reduced scaling functions, where we used for
scaling dimensions values from table x.

we can see in figs. 4-6 that nite size eects are
stronger for  closer to 1 (where they are in fact loga-
ritmic because of the appearance of marginal operators),
which is expected from [28].

vi. conclusion

in this paper we use the xxz spin chain in transverse
eld as a lattice regularization of the sine-gordon model

5

proposed in [14]. this equivalence can be understood
e.g. from conformal perturbation theory. one of our goals
was to calculate by numerical analysis masses in the sine-
gordon theory. this is now of interest because recent cal-
culations based on numerical treatment of bethe ansatz
[11] and innite momentum frame technique [10] are in
disagreement with previous approaches used in literature
[47]. our results are in agreement with dhn formula
contrary to previously mentioned papers. we stress that
methods used in this paper are independent of previous
approaches to sgm (which were criticized in [1012]).
we also analyse conformal limit and nd conformal di-
mensions of various states. we nd that the conformal
dimension of second breather state disagrees with the
conjecture by [14]. our calculations for dimensions of
other states agree with those in [14].

[26] in fact, exactly that happens when one connects mtm

to xyz spin chain [9].

[27] we employ an obvious notation for mass gaps; ms for
soliton, ma for antisoliton and mbn for n-th breather
where n = 1, 2.
