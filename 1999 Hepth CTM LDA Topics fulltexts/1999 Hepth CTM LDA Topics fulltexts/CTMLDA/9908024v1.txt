abstract

we compute the leading-order back-reaction to dilaton-driven ination, due
to graviton, dilaton and gauge-boson production. the one-loop eect turns
out to be non-vanishing (unlike the case for pure de-sitter and for power-law
ination), to be of relative order 2
h 2(t), and to have the correct sign for
p
favouring the exit to a frw phase.

1 introduction

in recent years, pre-big bang (pbb) cosmology [1] has established itself as a logically

consistent alternative to standard slow-roll ination [2]. while the ultimate verdict
on which, if either, of these two versions of cosmology will survive is left to future

experiments, at the theoretical level each one has its own advantages and shortcom-
ings.

the trade-o follows from the fundamental physical dierence between the two
in slow-roll ination the evolution is from larger to smaller curvatures,

scenarios:

while in dilaton-driven pbb ination the opposite is true. thus, while in the former
case planckian/string-scale curvatures are naturally reached at the very beginning,

pushing the problem of initial conditions into the full quantum-gravity domain (see
e.g. [3]), in the latter that problem can be tackled within a perfectly known (albeit

non-linear) set of equations (see e.g. [4]). on the other hand, since large curvatures
naturally occur at the end of dilaton-driven ination1, the exit problem becomes
harder to analyse than in the conventional scenario.

it is generally believed that the exit problem of string cosmology [5], i.e. achieving

a smooth, non-singular transition from inationary to frw-type string cosmology so-
lutions, should be solved by a combination of two kinds of eects, corresponding to

two dierent classes of corrections to the low-energy, tree-level eective action. while
higher-derivative corrections should be able to bound the growth of curvature [6] (or

to allow a reinterpretation of the lowest-order curvature singularity), loop corrections
[7], accounting for the back-reaction on the geometry from particle production, should
stop the growth of the coupling (of the dilaton) when a certain critical-energy con-

dition [8] is reached. recent proposals of cosmological entropy bounds [9] appear to
support [10] these ideas.

unfortunately, present techniques are still inadequate for giving a convincing an-

swer to the question of whether any one of these desired eects does actually take
place. the question of fully non-perturbative higher-derivative corrections amounts

1a phenomenologically interesting consequence of this dierence is that, in slow-roll ination,
planck/string-scale physics is screened from observation by the subsequent long inationary era;
in the pbb scenario, it is in principle accessible to observation.

to nding an exact (2d) conformal eld theory. however, since supersymmetry is
spontaneously broken in the case of cosmology, chances to get such a cft in closed

form are slim.

similarly, understanding the full eect of back-reaction would require knowledge

of the full one-loop eective action up to four derivatives. in spite of brilliant work
by vilkovisky and collaborators [11] on this problem, these are still early times for

applying the results so far obtained to our problem. thus our aim here will be
more modest: we will try to understand in which direction does the back-reaction

from particle production work in pbb cosmology while it is still a small eect. no
attempt will be therefore be made to achieve (a fortiori to describe) a complete exit.

we thus took an easier road, recently opened by iliopoulos et al.

[12] and by
abramo and woodard [13], [14]. their method was already checked, whenever pos-

sible, against the more intuitive approach of abramo, brandenberger and mukhanov
[15]. apart from our use of a dierent gauge, known to be more appropriate in string

cosmology, our work can be seen as a straightforward application of that method in
the context of string cosmology. as a check of gauge invariance, we will also reproduce

some results of [13], [14].

another (apparently strong) limitation of our work is that we consider loop cor-

rections to solutions of the low-energy eective action, i.e. we do not include higher-
derivative terms in the latter. since the back-reaction eect turns out to be of the

same order as a four-derivative term, it may look suspicious to neglect such terms
in the tree-level action while keeping them in the correction. there is, however, a

limit in which such an approximation is justied:
it is a large-n limit, where n is
the number of species of the produced particles. the one-loop back-reaction is of
relative order g2n2
sr and thus dominates over a tree-level higher-derivative correc-
sr) at suciently large2 g2n. finally, it can also be shown that higher-loop
tion o(2
eects on the metric, the dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor (axion) are paramet-
rically smaller at large g2n and small g2, justifying the one-loop approximation. this
observation makes it all the more urgent to devote further eort to a non-perturbative

understanding of one-loop back-reaction in cosmology.

2n is indeed a large number for a typical string theory gauge group, say e8  e8.

2

the paper is organized as follows: after recalling (sections 2 and 3) the form
of the lowest-order pbb background whose modication we wish to compute, and

the general idea of the method, we will introduce (section 4) our gauge choice and
then go, in section 5, to the heart of the calculation of the back-reaction, rst from

gravi-dilaton production, and then from gauge-bosons production. in section 6, after
expressing the nal result in a convenient form, we will argue that the back-reaction is
of the expected order of magnitude and that, at leading order at least, it modies the

original background in the right direction to help with the exit problem. finally, an
explicit check of the gauge independence of our results is presented in an appendix.

2 pbb backgrounds and fluctuations

in units in which 16g = h = c = 1 the normalized four-dimensional gravi-dilaton

eective action in the einstein frame reads:

s = z d4xg(cid:20)r 

1
2

()2(cid:21) .

(2.1)

even within this minimal set of moduli (corresponding to having frozen the axion
as well as internal dimensions), the gravi-dilaton system oers several interesting

cosmological solutions, including, of course, the simplest ones, which describe spatially
at, homogeneous and isotropic universes. in the comoving (cosmic)-time frame the
line element takes the form

ds2 = dt2

0 + a2

0(t0) d~x  d~x ,

(2.2)

where t0 represents comoving time (we shall often use the sux 0 to denote tree-level
quantities). in the discussion of quantum uctuations it is often convenient to go over
to the so-called conformal frame, in which the metric (2.2) becomes

ds2 = 2()(cid:16)d2 + d~x  d~x(cid:17) .

we recall that comoving and conformal times are related by dt0 = d .
conformal frame a typical pbb-type solution appears as follows:

(2.3)

in the

 =   

 i!1/2

,

0 = 

3 ln () ,

 i <  < 0 ,

(2.4)

3

where, by identifying the (arbitrary) constant  i with the beginning of dilaton-driven
ination (ddi), we have normalized  to 1 at that moment. it is convenient to dene,
as usual, h() = / = 1/2 , which is related to the physical hubble parameter h
by

h0 =

a0
a0

=


2 = hi3 =

1
3t0

,

t0 < 0 ,

(2.5)

where hi = 1/2 i refers to the initial value of the physical hubble parameter. note
that, at initial time  = i, the physical hubble parameter is given by  since i = 1.
we remind the reader that the above background corresponds to ddi in the string

frame, with a string-frame scale factor blowing up like (ts)1/3 when the comoving
string time ts approaches 0 from negative values (ts  0). in the einstein frame,
this is seen as a contraction (gravitational collapse, see [4]). what remains frame-
independent is the fact that curvature grows in time, rather than decreases as in

power-law ination. this is why the results of [14] cannot be directly used in our
context.

let us now dene the uctuations around the classical backgrounds by:

g = 2 ( + ) ,

 = 0 +  .

(2.6)

our goal here is to compute the back-reaction on the above homogeneous backgrounds
(2.4) (i.e.  and ) due to quantum uctuations at leading order. following [13],
[14], we will thus parametrize the correction to the solution (2.4) by

hi = a() + c()tt

hi = d() ,

(2.7)

where t  (1, 0, 0, 0) is a time-like vector and  =  + tt  diag (0, 1, 1, 1) .
in the next section we shall recall the method of refs. [12], [13], [14] for computing

a, c and d. here we just conclude by recalling that a, c and d have no physical
meaning separately. for instance, if a and d are given in terms of c by

a = h0

0

d =

()z

then all three can be gauged away by the redenition of time,    + 1

2 1r  c.

d(c)()

d(c)() ,

(2.8)

3 the procedure

since our background is of the power-law (though not of the power-ination) type,

we shall closely follow here the procedure described in [14] for computing a, c, d.
we will then stress at which point the two procedures start to diverge. in [14] the
authors rst compute some amputated one-point functions denoted by ,  and  (see

below), and then attach external leg propagators in order to reconstruct the desired
functions a, c, d. let us describe the procedure in a dierent, perhaps simpler, way.
if, generically, we wish to compute a uctuation i over a generic background 0i,

then the relevant one-point function is given by the obvious functional integral

hi(x)i = r deis[0+]i(x)
r deis[0+]

.

(3.1)

if the action is expanded only up to the quadratic order in , the one-point functions
if, however, the action is expanded up to cubic order, s[0 +
are trivially zero.
] = s[0]+ sij
3 [0]ijk (the summation convention is adopted
everywhere), and sijk
3 [0] is treated perturbatively, then there is a non-trivial one-
loop correction to the one-point functions (see fig. 1). this is the familiar story
of vacuum-shifting tadpoles in quantum eld theory. analytically the result can be

2 [0]ij + sijk

expressed as follows:

hi(x)i = r deis[0]+isij

2 [0]ij isjkn

3

r deis[0]+isij

[0]i(x)jkn + ...
2 [0]ij

.

(3.2)

the calculation of the diagrams in fig. 1 can be performed in two steps. first, we

then the full one-point functions are obtained by attaching the appropriate external
lines. formula (3.2) gives

hi(x)i = z d4zhi(x)j(z)ihk(z)n(z)i[isjkn

3

] ,

(3.3)

where (dropping indices hereafter), h(x)(z)i is the standard feynman propagator
for the quadratic action s2[0]2  , i.e.

(x)h(x)(z)i = i4(x  z) .

finally, one can express the one-point function as:

h(x)i = 1(x)h(x)(x)i[s3] .

(3.4)

(3.5)

it turns out that the coincident limit propagator h(x)(x)i is a function of time, x0,
only. therefore, if one can invert the kinetic operator in the zero-momentum limit,

then (3.5) provides our nal expression for the one-point function. for the purpose
of the rst step it is convenient to distinguish three kinds of amputated one-point
functions, ,  and , dened respectively in figs. 2, 3 and 4.

as an illustration of the use of (3.5), we present here the calculation of the one-
point function a in the covariant gauge introduced in [12]. note, from (2.7), that a is
nothing but the amplitude h11i, which can be expanded from the general denition
(3.3) and fig. 1, in terms of the amputated one-point functions ,  and  as:

a  h11i   + h11itt   + h11i   .

(3.6)

as in (3.5), the external line propagators can be replaced by the inverse of the kinetic
operators in the zero-momentum limit.
in the covariant gauge of iliopoulos et al.
the lagrangian can be diagonalized by transforming the variables into suitable linear

combinations. the propagators of the original variables can be read o from those
of the diagonalized variables by applying the inverse transformation. for a standard
power-law-ination background,   ts with s > 1, one easily nds

h11itt =
h11i = (cid:18)4 +

s + 1

(3.7)

h11i = 

ia +

ic

s
s + 1
s

ia +

ic

s + 1

s

6

where ia and ic are particular propagators of the diagonalizing variables. they
can be replaced by the inverses of the corresponding kinetic operators in the zero-
momentum limit, 1/da and 1/dc. with this replacement, when (3.7) is plugged
back into the expression for the one-point function a in (3.6), we immediately reach

the desired expression for a:

a =

# . (3.8)

this equation is the same as was given in [14]. the above outline shows how simply
the relevant formulae can be obtained once the general result (3.5) has been derived.
in the iliopoulos et al. gauge, which does need ghosts, there are three dierent types

of loops, shown in figs. 2, 3, and 4, where the dotted line describes the graviton, the
dashed line the ghost, and the solid line the dilaton.

figure 3: the -type amputated one-point function

let us now briey compare this approach to the one of ref. [15], whose authors

have used a more intuitive method by computing the energy-momentum tensor of the
quantum uctuations and their back-reaction over the original backgrounds directly.

the quantum uctuations are obtained by solving the linear order perturbation equa-
tions and the constraints. in our approach, as in [13], one uses instead the constraints

and the gauge-xing conditions to obtain the feynman propagators entering the loops.

in [15] the back-reaction was computed through systematic corrections of einsteins
equations, the rst non-vanishing correction being quadratic in the planck length p ,
the small expansion parameter characterizing quantum uctuations to leading order.
the counterpart to this in our approach is that the same parameter, 2
p , controls the
loop expansion in quantum gravity. incidentally, this last observation neatly solves an
apparent paradox: classical gravitational waves always carry positive energy while, as
we shall see, the back-reaction from the quantum production of gravitational waves

from the vacuum turns out to have, at least in some cases, negative energy. the
point is that, in the case of the amplication of vacuum uctuations, there is no pa-

rameter allowing a separation of real-graviton production from other virtual one-loop
eects whose sign is undetermined. this a-priori non-determination of the sign of the

back-reaction is self-evident in the eective action approach [11].

we will follow the same procedure as outlined above in a dierent gauge where

physical variables are more explicit. the usefulness of this gauge was rst pointed
out in [16] and its signicance has been explored in detail in [17], in the context of
linear order perturbations to pbb backgrounds. in the next section we summarize

results in the o-diagonal gauge relevant for the background (2.4). in the appendix
we will comment on the gauge dependence of the results by comparing them to those

obtained in other gauges, e.g. in the covariant gauge of [12].

as explained in the previous section, in order to analyse the perturbations we need

to expand (2.1) to quadratic and cubic orders in the uctuations. we nd:

(4.3)

where hij represents the (transverse and traceless) tensor part with hii = 0 and
ihij = 0. the trace  is given by  = 2 + 6  22e, where 2  ii. the
action (2.1), when expanded up to quadratic order in the variables (4.3), shows that
b and  behave like lagrange multipliers, giving rise to the following constraints (a
prime refers to /):

(4.4)

making use of the rst constraint in (4.4), it is possible to diagonalize the quadratic
part of the action in our background as

s2 =

(4.5)

where v and ij are the canonical variables, given in terms of the original elds as

v = ( 

0
h

) = ( + 23) ,

ij = hij .

(4.6)

owing to two local gauge symmetries that preserve the form (4.3), two out of the four
functions can be xed through two independent gauge choices. the o-diagonal gauge

corresponds to choosing  = e = 0, which simplies the rst canonical variable to
v = . the rest of the variables become related to this canonical variable in simple
ways because of other relations following from the constraints (4.4),  = 3/2 and
2b = 3/2.

the process of obtaining the propagator for the canonical variables is simplied by
dragging the scale factor, , from the canonical variables to the quadratic dierential
operator. in the o-diagonal gauge this amounts to

s2 =

1

2 z d4x(cid:20) +

the dierential operator , in the zero-momentum limit, is easily inverted:

(4.7)

(4.8)

as has been advertised in [14]. this choice of the inverse operator also enforces the
boundary conditions

1

0 f (i) = (1

0 f )(i) = 0,

(4.9)

a property we require for the corrections a, c and d.

from the quadratic action (4.7) it is easy to read out the feynman propagators

for the physical modes

h(x)(y)i = i1(x, y)
hhij(x)hkl(y)i = 2tijklhi1(x, y)i ,

(4.10)

where tijkl is an appropriately normalized tensor enforcing the transverse and trace-
less conditions on gravitons,
i.e. itijkl = jtijkl = ktijkl = ltijkl = 0 and
tiikl = tijkk = 0. for our purpose we are interested in computing the propagator

10

1(x, y) in the coincident limit x  y. to do this we go to the fourier-transformed
variables

(x) = z

d3k
(2)3 k()eikx ,

hij(x) = z

d3k
(2)3 hkij()eikx ,

(4.11)

where both the mode functions k and hkij can be obtained by solving the dierential
equations fk() = 0. the solutions can be expressed in terms of hankel functions
of the second kind. notice that, v =  being the canonical variable, one should

normalize its modes in the far past,   , as 1/q|k|. by the large-argument

limit of the hankel function, this completely xes the modes:

fk() =

1
2

h (1)

0 (|k|) .

(4.12)

consequently the propagator in the coincident-point limit takes the form

(4.13)

here we have replaced the transverse, traceless tijkl tensor by its fourier transform.
the integral in (4.13) is in general divergent in the ultraviolet. it should be kept in

mind, however, that the present approach should be complemented by a momentum
cuto as a result of the ultraviolet sickness of gravity. we set the cuto, at any given
time, at kmax  |h|, which corresponds to a wavelength of the order of the hubble
radius. this is also the scale at which the mode functions switch from free plane waves

to frozen out modes. for modes larger than this wavelength the bosonic contribution
dominates its fermionic counterpart (we assume some underlying supersymmetry) as
a result of bose-condensation. this is the eect we are after. for shorter-wavelength

modes new degrees of freedom should appear, which would ultimately provide better
ultraviolet behaviour, as in superstring theory. we also impose an infrared cuto
coming from a nite duration of dilaton-driven ination, kmin  |hi|, corresponding
to the maximal hubble radius. in conclusion we restrict momenta in all loops to be in

11

the range: |hi|  k  |h| = |hi|/2. at this upper-momentum/short-wavelength
cuto, |h|  1/||, i.e. our cuto corresponds to |k|  1. note that, in the
o-diagonal gauge, as a result of the constraints, all elds can be expressed in terms
of . thus only one type of amputated loops, the -type, eectively arises on the

right-hand side of (3.5).

5 computation of the one-point functions

in the rst two subsections we shall compute the amputated one-point functions due
to graviton, dilaton, and gauge-boson loops. in the last subsection the external zero-

momentum propagators will be glued in to reconstruct the full one-point functions.

5.1 graviton and dilaton loops

to get the three-point vertices we use our expansion of the action (4.1) to cubic order
in the uctuations, s3. the results are summarized in tables 1 and 2, showing all
the relevant three-point vertices. in table 3 we list all the coincident loops appearing
in  and their respective contributions to the loop integrals (x = |k|). there is
another way of doing the same computation, which involves, in general, four types of

amputated loops in the o-diagonal gauge (fig. 5).

figure 5: all possible types of amputated one-point functions in the o-diagonal gauge.
here the line represents all possible coincident propagators.

the rst type of loops, having hij in the external leg, turn out to be zero, since the
loop (see both tables 1 and 2), in the coincident limit, always picks up a factor of ij,
which gives vanishing contributions because of the tracelessness of hij. the second
type of loops, having 0i in the external leg, also gives vanishing contributions, but
for a dierent reason. note that 0i = ib can be integrated by parts to act on

12

the loop. the loops, however, being functions only of time in the coincident limit
(4.13) give zero when hit by a space derivative. thus only the third and fourth types

of loops survive in the o-diagonal gauge, the -type and -type loops as dened in
figs. 3 and 4.

another important feature of the o-diagonal gauge is the absence of the faddeev
popov ghosts. this can be readily seen from the gauge transformations of the gauge-

xing functions  and e. their gauge transformations have been given in [18]:

   + h(x) ,

e  e  (x) ,

(5.1)

where  and  are the two gauge parameters associated with the coordinate trans-
formations:      and xi  xi  i. clearly, the faddeevpopov determinant
is eld-independent and hence the ghosts are decoupled, unlike what happens in the

covariant gauge of [12].

as an example, we present a sample calculation, say the three-point vertex #5
of table 2. for illustrative purposes, it is easier to make use of the constraints at

the beginning (in contrast, in the computer code its more convenient to impose the
constraints later). as we have argued, this does not make a dierence, which is at

the same time an important consistency check for our method. making use of the
constraints in the o-diagonal gauge presented in the previous section, the tr(),

14

present in the vertex #5, can be replaced by the scalar uctuation . as we said, in
this case there is only one type of amputated loop e, that can be read o from the
vertex #5:

e =

3
4

[2hi + 4hihi + 2hi + 2hiii] .

(5.2)

now, one should look at table 3, where various propagators have been listed in this
gauge and pick up the leading-order terms from (5.2) as we approach the limit,  
0. recall that 2  ||, and hence all the terms in (5.2) are of the same order, 1/4.

5.2 gauge-boson loops

let us now study the back-reaction produced by gauge elds to the background (2.4).
there are two distinct types of gauge elds appearing in the low-energy string eective

action  the ns-type and the r-type. the ns-type couple to all the fundamental
moduli while the r-type couple only to the metric. let us rst concentrate on the
ns-type gauge bosons. in the canonical frame the action is:

sem =

1

4 z d4xegggff ,

(5.3)

which supplements the gravitondilaton action (2.1) in the presence of the ns-type
elds. since the gauge-boson action (5.3) is already quadratic in the gauge elds,

these decouple, to linear order, from other uctuations. also, interactions stemming
from a possible non-abelian gauge structure can be ignored. we shall work in the
coulomb gauge where the temporal component of the gauge eld is zero and the
spatial components satisfy iai = 0. going over to a canonical gauge-eld variable,
the action can be written in the form

sem

2 =

1

2 z d4xii ,

 = 2

 + 2  e0/2(e0/2) ,

(5.4)

where the canonical eld is given by i = e0/2ai. fourier expanding as before, the
mode functions satisfy the homogeneous equation

i = z

d3k
(2)3 ki()eikx , i = 0 , kiki = 0 ,

(5.5)

15

the solution of which can be written down [19] in terms of the hankel functions of
the second kind. following the same normalization arguments as presented before,

the coulomb-gauge feynman propagator for the canonical elds can be expressed in
the form

1

d3k
(2)3

hi(x)j(y)i = z
(ky0)i eik(xy) (5.6)
where the index  = (3  1)/2. the cubic vertices have been listed in table 4 and

 (kx0)ihh (1)

4(cid:16)ij 

kikj

k2 (cid:17)hh (1)

the coincident loops are presented in table 5.

for the r-type gauge bosons, the coupling to the dilaton being absent in the eec-
tive action (5.3), the mode functions satisfy the free wave equations: ki + k2ki = 0.
clearly, these modes are not parametrically amplied; and hence their contributions

to the back-reaction are negligible.

the relevant diagrams for gauge bosons are the same as in fig. 5 except that here
the solid line represents the gauge loop. notice, from table 4, that all the three-point

vertices are quadratic in the gauge elds and at the linear order there is no coupling
between the gauge elds and the gravitational perturbations. among the loops, see
again fig. 5, the ones that have hij and 0i as external legs are zero for the same
reason as presented before. the rest of the diagrams are of the  or  type. as an
example, let us take the vertex #6 of table 4. it contributes to e as

e =

1
2

exp(0)[haiaii + hkaikaii] .

(5.7)

3, which cancels the
the exponential factor is common to all the vertices and is  ||
inverse factor in the second coincident-limit propagator, as can be seen from table
5. it requires some more eort to see that this is also happening for the rst entry
of table 5, but again, even for gauge bosons, the leading eect in the amputated
one-point functions is  1/4.

5.3 adding external propagators

following (3.5) we have rst computed the amputated one-point functions in the
o-diagonal gauge. as it turned out, after summing over all the vertices in tables
1 and 2, the leading-order terms, as   0, have the time dependence 1/4. we
now attach the external line, i.e. the inverse of the zero-momentum kinetic operator,
0. from (4.8) we note that our amputated quantities have to go through a double
-integral and multiplication by 2. thus the leading-order time dependence of
the one-point functions is simply 1/3. going through the procedure more carefully,
we see that, apart for some numerical factors (which are dierent for dierent one-

point functions), the leading-order contribution to all one-point functions is of order
1/hi3. this result suggests that, in the context of pbb cosmology, the dominant
modes are those near the upper momentum cut-o k  1. as we have already
argued, contributions from modes beyond this cut-o, |k|  1, have to be combined
with those from other elds, e.g. from fermions. the resulting combined eect will be

typical of a short-distance renormalization of the bare parameters of the lagrangian,
which should be mild in a supersymmetric theory. apart from this, the physical

17

eect from short distances should be parametrically smaller than the eect we have
computed. considering (2.4), (2.5), and the formula hi = 1/2i, the contribution we
have found can be simply expressed, in our units, as:

(a, c, d) 

1
hi3 

h 2
i
6  h 2
0 .

(5.8)

what about the ratio between the three one-point functions in the o-diagonal

gauge? our answer turns out to be simply:
c = 3d ,

a = 0 ,

d = 1

0 e .

(5.9)

we should point out that, while (5.9) appears to parametrize only certain forms of
metric uctuations, other contributions, such as h0ii or hiji, i 6= j, have been
shown to be exactly zero. also, the vanishing of  easily follows from the property
hii = 0 and from the coincident-point limit of the loop (4.13).

to reach (5.9) one could follow another path, which parallels more closely [13] and
[14]. one can take into account all types of loops corresponding to all the variables

appearing in the uctuations (2.6) and use the constraints at the end. as a matter
of fact, this also provides a good consistency check of the method. here again, from
very general considerations (cf. the three-point vertices in tables 1, 2 and 4), loops
with 0i and hij as external legs vanish, and only -type and the -type amputated
functions survive. thus the results (5.9) follow in a dierent way:

a = 0 ,

c = 3d ,

d = 1

0 (cid:16) + 3(cid:17) ,

(5.10)

where (5.10) is identical to (5.9) since the constraints provide the relation e =
 + 3.

we are now ready to discuss the physical implications of our results for the pbb

scenario.

6 discussion

the physical eects due to back-reaction are best analysed, in a pbb context, by
going over to the string frame. in order to prepare for that, let us write down the

18

nal outcome of our calculation in the o-diagonal gauge as

hds2i = 2[(1  c)d2 + d~x  d~x ] = dt2 + a2(t)d~x  d~x
hi = 0 + d ,

(6.1)

where c and d are as given explicitly in (5.10). since we limit ourselves to times for
which c  1, the new comoving time t is related to the background comoving time
by

dt  (cid:18)1 

1
2

c(cid:19) d = (cid:18)1 

1
2

c(cid:19) dt0 .

(6.2)

expressing the dilaton and the hubble parameter h associated with the scale factor
a in the new comoving time, and after using the relation (5.9) between c and d we

nd

2

3 hln(t) 
hi  
d
dthln ai 

h =

3di

1

3t h1 + 3di .

(6.3)

in order to go over to the string frame, we introduce the corresponding comoving time
dts = exp(hi/2)dt and the scale factor as = exp(hi/2)a. after a straightforward
calculation the resulting string-frame hubble parameter and dilaton can be written

as

hs =

d
dtshln asi  

73  3
d# ,
hi  (3 + 1)hln(ts)  (23  3)di .

3ts "1 +

2

(6.4)

it turns out that, in the einstein frame, d(t) is a positive number times the square
of the hubble parameter. for the minimal gravi-dilaton system, we nd:

d(t) = 0.0047h 2

0 (t) .

(6.5)

although the coecient of h 2
h = c = 1), plancks time is given by t2
dimensionless) correction to the tree-level background is:

0 looks small, we have to recall that, in our units (16g =
p = 1/16. in other words, the (relative,

d = 0.24 t2

p h 2
0 ,

19

(6.6)

i.e. does not contain any particularly small number.

when one goes to the string frame, in which the string length s is a constant, the
same result as (6.6) for d follows, provided one interprets tp as the eective, time-
dependent, planck time tp = se/2 and h0 is expressed in terms of the string-frame
 (now the dot refers to derivative w.r.t. cosmic string
hubble parameter and of
time) by the standard relation h0 = hs  /2.

when the ns-gauge-boson loops are included the numbers in (6.5) change but the

conclusions do not. the contribution of a single gauge boson to d turns out to be

d = 0.00016h 2

0 = 0.008 t2

p h 2
0 ,

(6.7)

i.e. of the same sign but about 30 times smaller than that of the gravi-dilaton system
(6.5). the result (6.7) should be multiplied by the number of ns gauge bosons, which,

in typical superstring theories, could be in the range of hundreds.

in both cases the one-loop correction adds to the rate of ination and to the rate

of growth of the dilaton. at rst sight, this seems to go against an eventual exit from
ination. however, what is crucial for the exit is not so much the absolute rates of

growth but rather the relative rate of dilaton and scale-factor growth.

to be more precise, let us compute directly the eect of back-reaction on the
string-frame quantity , where  =   3 ln as is the duality-invariant shifted dilaton
and, as before, the dot refers to the time derivative in the string frame. from eq.
(6.4) we easily compute:

 = 

1

ts "1 

9  33

2

d# .

(6.8)

the positive sign of d is forcing  to decrease (relative to the tree-level value) as the
result of a competition between a growing dilaton and a growing hubble parameter in
the string frame. it is thus obvious that the ratio /hs will change from its tree-level
value of 3 towards smaller values. as shown in fig. 6, this is precisely as required
by a graceful exit [5], i.e. the phase-space trajectory in the -h plane should turn
anticlockwise. incidentally, this is also what the hubble entropy bound of [9] requires
[10].

another way the eect (6.8) can be understood is by computing the eective
energy and pressure densities produced by the quantum uctuations and by check-

figure 6: the phase diagram of pbb cosmology. the curve shows the direction in
which the back-reaction we computed is modifying the lowest order solution (straight
line) helping an eventual ow from ddi to a frw-phase.

ing whether the condition s + ps < 0 is obeyed, where s and ps are the en-
ergy and pressure densities in the quantum uctuations. let us study this rst
in the einstein frame. for an additional ideal uid of energy-momentum tensor
t 
 = diag(, p, p, p) added to the dilaton the energy density and pressure den-
sity appear in the einsteinfriedmann equations as

 = 6h 2

2 , p = 4 h + 6h 2 +

2 .

(6.9)

when both  and p vanish, we recover, of course, the tree-level solutions. inserting
instead the corrected metric and dilaton backgrounds, we easily obtain:

 = 

4
3

d
t2 ,

p = 0 .

(6.10)

since d is positive, see (6.5) and (6.6), the energy density is negative in the einstein

frame. the value p = 0 is special to the background (2.4). we have checked that, for
other power-law backgrounds (e.g. for radiation-like solutions) p does not vanish.

21

to translate these results to the string frame, we note that the corresponding

energy and pressure densities are given by

s + 2
es = e = 3h 2
eps = ep = 2 hs  3h 2

s  2hs   2 + 2 ,

(6.11)

so that, again, s < 0 and ps = 0. hence, the condition s + ps < 0 is clearly
met, see fig. 6.

we conclude that, from all points of view, the computed back-reaction goes in the
right direction to favour a change to the frw branch and to avoid violation of the
entropy bounds.

appendix

here we compare our results with similar calculations done in other gauges, such as
the iliopoulos et al. gauge, which has been extensively used in the recent literature to

compute back-reaction to chaotic [13] and power-law ination [14]. specically, in the
latter case, the authors found no strong eect (i.e. growing with time) at one loop.
it might not be so clear to the reader why the one-loop eect is so dominant in pbb

ination, which is also essentially power law. to clarify the situation it is important
to recall the basic distinction between pbb and standard power-law ination.
in
the pbb case the hubble parameter grows with time, as t  0, and as a result
higher frequency modes leave the horizon at higher values of the hubble parameter,

see fig. 7. the loop integrals are thus dominated by the latest value of the hubble
parameter, in contrast with the case of standard power law, where they are dominated

by its initial value. it is also important to keep in mind the two dierent time limits:
in the case of standard power law, the limit is t  , whereas, in pbb it is, t  0.
this makes a crucial dierence when deciding which are the dominant or subdominant

eects.

as a check of gauge invariance, we feel it is worthwhile to redo the standard
power-law calculation in the o-diagonal gauge. it will provide a direct check of the

results obtained in the gauge used in [14], as well as help to better understand the
dierences between the two cases in the same gauge. let us recall some of the basic

note that for the special value s = 1/3, corresponding to the pbb case, the potential
vanishes. to proceed as before, in the o-diagonal gauge, we have to rst nd the

quadratic constraints through which the metric perturbations become related to the
canonical variable . one nds

(6.14)

the rest of the analysis is almost the same as before, except one should take into
account the extra three-point vertices coming from the potential (6.13). using the

23

constraints and the gauge choice, the one-point functions turn out to have the follow-
ing forms

a = 0 , c =

(6.15)

where  and  represent the same amputated diagrams as before. after summing over
the vertices, it turns out that the leading eect in the one-point functions is of the
form3 d  ln t0. if we proceed, as in the case of pbb, to study the contribution of c
and d to  and honeloop, we nd that the leading logarithms disappear, irrespective
of the numerical factor in front of ln t0. the reason for the cancellation is twofold:
rstly, the relation (6.15) between c and d insures that the changes in  and h
are proportional. secondly, it is easy to show that for c  ln t0 the change in h is
subleading since ct/c  (1/ ln t)  0.

finally let us briey point out another technical dierence between the pbb and

the standard power-law cases. in the pbb case the constraints relating  and b to 
have signs opposite to those in (6.14) implying that c and d have the same sign, see
(5.9). this is why their eects on  and honeloop add up, in contrast to the case of
standard power law, where they compete with each other. furthermore, the leading
behaviour is no longer logarithmic, explaining why a large eect survives only in the

pbb case.
