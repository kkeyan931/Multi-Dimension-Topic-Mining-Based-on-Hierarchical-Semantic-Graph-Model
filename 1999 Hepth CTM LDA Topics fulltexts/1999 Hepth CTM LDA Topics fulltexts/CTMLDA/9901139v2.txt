abstract

we demonstrate that any scale-invariant mechanics of one variable exhibits
not only 0+1 conformal symmetry, but also the symmetries of a full virasoro
algebra. we discuss the implications for the ads/cft correspondence.

i. introduction

recently, there has been much interest in the conjectured correspondence between theo-
ries of gravity in anti-de sitter background and conformal eld theories living on the bound-
ary of ads [1] [2] [3]. a particularly interesting example of this is the ads2/cf t1 corre-
spondence [4] [5] [6].
in particular, strominger [4] pointed out that quantum gravity on
ads2 must be a conformal theory on a strip, which exhibits the symmetries of the virasoro
algebra. this suggests that perhaps the boundary conformal theory also exhibits the sym-
metries of the full virasoro algebra despite the fact that, naively, the boundary theory is
quantum mechanics. this suggestion is lent credence by a recent proposal of gibbons and
townsend [7], who suggest that the boundary theory for ads2 is given by a calogero model
of quantum mechanics. this model is a limit of a more general calogero model, which was
shown to exhibit the symmetries of a virasoro algebra [8].

in fact the so(1, 2) isometry group of ads2, which forms the 0+1 conformal group, is
given by the charge-free subalgebra of the virasoro algebra generated by l1, l0 and l1. a
conformal mechanics describing the dynamics of a particle in the background of a reisnner-
nordstrom black hole was given in [9]. motivated by [4], we consider the system given in
[9] to determine if one can nd generators of the full virasoro algebra. not only do we nd
generators of the full algebra, but we also nd (somewhat surprisingly) that given any scale-
invariant hamiltonian of one dynamical variable, one can classically nd generators of the
full virasoro algebra (the global subalgebra of which generates 0+1 conformal symmetry).

ii. finding the generators

one can write the 0+1 dimensional conformal algebra in the following manner

[d, h] = h

[d, k] = k

[h, k] = 2d

(1)

where h is the hamiltonian, d is the generator of dilatations, and k is the generator of the
special conformal symmetry. by making the identication

l0 = d

l1 = h

l1 = k

we see that the l0, l1 and l1 satisfy the virasoro algebra

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n + a(m)m+n.

in [9], we nd

d =

1
2

pr

h =

p2
2f

k = 

1
2

f r2

f =

1
2

m[r1 + (

rp

2mm

)2 + 1].

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

we take m = 1 and take the non-relativistic massive limit, which corresponds to f  1
(this means that we must scale the r and p by appropriate powers of the mass, giving p

1

weight 1
we can rewrite part of the envisioned virasoro algebra as

2 and giving r weight  1

2 ). we now see if we can extend the algebra. in this case,

[l1, ln] = (n + 1)ln1 = p

[ln, l1] = (n  1)ln+1 = r

ln
r

ln
p

(6)

(7)

where we evaluate the algebra classically (ie. using poisson brackets) . using these two
relations, we nd

ln =

r2

n  2

2ln1
rp

+

(n + 1)r

p

ln1.

(8)

given that we have l0 = 1

2 rp, we can use this recursive relation to see that we must have

ln = 


2

r1+np1n.

now, we must check that these ls satisfy the virasoro algebra.

[lm, ln] = 

= 

1
4
1
4

[r1+mp1m, r1+np1n]

([(1 + m)(1  n)  (1  m)(1 + n)]r1+n+mp1(n+m))

= (m  n)ln+m

(9)

(10)

we thus conrm that we in fact have the generators of the full virasoro algebra. one
should also note that the ls we have found do not seem to obey the usual relationship
l

n = ln.

iii. the general case: scale-invariant hamiltonians

we now consider the most general scale invariant hamiltonian we can write, given that

p has dimension 1

2 and r has dimension  1

2

h =

p2

2f (u)

(11)

where f is an arbitrary function of u = rp. motivated by our previous calculation and the
results of [9], we make the following ansatz,

ln = 


2

r1+np1nf n.

(12)

we use the convention [r, p] = 1

2

note that this reduces to the case in [9] and to the free particle case described above in the
appropriate limits. again, we must check that the full virasoro algebra is satised.

[lm, ln] = 

1
4

[r1+mp1mf m, r1+np1nf n]

= (m  n)lm+n 

1
4

[r2+n+mp2(n+m)f n+m1 f
u

][(1 + m)n

 (1  m)n + (1  n)m  (1 + n)m]
= (m  n)lm+n

(13)

this shows that given any scale invariant hamiltonian of one variable, one can construct
(classically) not only the generators of 0+1 dimensional conformal symmetry, but also the
generators of the full virasoro algebra.

iv. the relativistic limit

we will now consider the massless relativistic limit. in this case, we do not scale r and p
by powers of a mass. thus, r has weight 1 and p has weight 1. we may rewrite this case
in terms of our previous analysis by making the following change of variables

r = r2

p =

l
 r

= p

r
r

=

p
2r

(14)

where we see, as expected, that r has weight -1 and p has weight 1 note that rp = r p
now choose

2 . if we

f (rp) = rp f(r p)

then we nd

ln = 


2

r1+np1nf n = 


2

r1+2np f n = r1+n p f n.

(15)

(16)

let us set f = 1. we see that l1 = p is then related to the relativistic hamiltonian
h = p in the expected manner . the charge-free subgroup provides a representation of the
0+1 conformal group as well [10].

one reason why we consider the relativisitic limit here is because it can easily be linked
to the the representation of the virasoro algebra in terms of dieomorphisms of a circle.
from that point of view, one may write the generators of the algebra as

ln = en 


.

(17)

we may instead consider the hamiltonian h = |p|. this may be achieved this by setting f = 1
for positive p and f = 1 for negative p. note that there are technical issues associated with the
singular behavior at p = 0.

3

consider then the transformation

r = e

ln = en 


= r1+n 
r

= r1+n p.

(18)

note, however, that the condition that r be real amounts to the constraint that either  = c
or  =  + c where c is purely imaginary. in some sense, we can think of the virasoro
algebra (in the relativistic free particle limit, at least) as arising from the dieomorphisms
of a circle, analytically continued to a real line.

v. computing the central charge

the analysis of the previous section also provides insight into the quantization of the
virasoro algebra. the transition  
 r  p is essentially the quantization of the system.
the transformation of the previous section then seems to give us an ordering for the quantum
generators. in particular, we make the ansatz

as a quantum operator. we then examine the full quantum algebra, and nd

ln = r1+n p

[ln, lm] = [r1+n p, r1+m p]

= r1+n[p, r1+m p]  [r1+n, r1+m p]p
= r1+n[p, r1+m]p  r1+m[r1+n, p]p
= (n  m)r1+n+m p = (n  m)ln+m.

(19)

(20)

in the case of the free relativistic particle, we have exhibited generators which satisfy the
full quantum virasoro algebra with no central charge.

vi. multiplets of states

one might expect to be able to nd the states organized into highest weight represen-
tations of the virasoro algebra. in fact, this is somewhat dicult. in 1+1 conformal eld
theory, l0 is the hamiltonian and is bounded from below. since all of the other ls will
shift the eigenvalue of l0, one nds that the eigenstate of l0 corresponding to its minimum
eigenvalue must be annihilated by the half of the ls which are lowering operators. it is
upon this eigenstate that one builds multiplets of the algebra. in our case, however, l0 is
the generator of dilatations, and its eigenvalues are not bounded. instead, the hamiltonian
is given (up to constant factors) by l1. in order to nd an equivalent construction, we
must nd linear combinations of the ls such that

[h,xn

anln] = c xn

anln.

(21)

these operators will then be the raising and lowering operators of the representation. using
the commutation relations, one can easily see that the raising and lowering operators will
be of the form

4

ekrp.

(22)

one could see this just as well by remembering that since h = p, the raising and lowering
operators are just operators which shift the momentum. the only state which is annihilated
by these operators is the zero momentum state. but since it is annihilated by all of these
operators, one cannot build the multiplet upon it. in that sense, there is no highest weight
representation.

vii. hermiticity and global time

we have noted that, for the constructions provided in the previous sections, one does
not have the condition l
n = ln. this seems unusual given that, in some cases, the scale-
invariant mechanics actually describes the motion of a particle in the background of ads2.
the lns of the bulk are the fourier modes of the bulk stress-energy tensor, and as such
must obey the hermiticity condition. one might ask why the same does not appear to be
true for the particle. the answer is related to the choice of time.

both the free non-relativistic particle and free relativistic particle are limits of the hamil-
tonian found in [9]. that hamiltonian was derived from the born-infeld action for the radial
excitations of a particle in the background of ads2 s2 given in poincare coordinates. these
coordinates do not cover the entire anti-de sitter space. one can write these coordinates in
such a way that the space they cover is a half-plane which is conformally at.

ds2 =

1
u2 (dt2 + du2)

u > 0

(23)

if one thinks of these coordinates as parametizing the upper half of the complex plane,
then time translation is the same as translation along the real axis. since the lns generate
transformations of the upper half-plane, one can see that l1 is the generator of translation
along the real axis. therefore, it is reasonable to associate the hamiltonian with l1. one
then easily sees that one can identify l1,0,1 with h,d and k in such a way that the virasoro
algebra and 0+1 conformal algebra both close.

but this is not the usual situation with which we are familiar from 1+1 conformal eld
in that case, we generally nd that the hamiltonian is given by l0, and that
theory.
l
in order to nd similar relations, one must choose the time coordinate such
that time translation is generated by l0. global time coordinates  are well suited for this
purpose. these coordinates may be written as

n = ln.

ds2 = (1 + a2r2)dt2 + (1 + a2r2)1dr2.

after the transformation

and a wick rotation, one nds the metric

tan() = ar

 = eat

(24)

(25)

we will actually parameterize cads2, the covering space of ads2.

5

ds2 =

1

a22cos2()

(d2 + 2d2)




2

<  <

.

(26)

it is clear that time translation now corresponds to scaling of the half-plane, which is gen-
erated by l0.

let us now write the action of a particle in an anti-de sitter space background given in

global time coordinates.

l = mq(1 + a2r2)  (1 + a2r2)1 r2

the hamiltonian associated with this action is

h = (1 + a2r2)

1

2 (m2 + p2 + a2r2p2)

1

2 .

(27)

(28)

in the large radius, relativisitic limit the hamiltonian reduces to h = p (as one would
expect for a relativisitic particle in nearly at space). following the logic used above, we set
l0 = h = p.

we must now attempt to nd the generators of the rest of the virasoro algebra. note
that we should not expect l1,0,1 to be expressed in terms of h, d and k (which is the
formulation appropriate to poincare coordinates). if l0 = h, there is no way to write l1 or
l1 in terms of h, k or d such that they close under the virasoro algebra. but one quickly
sees that in order for [lm, l0] = mlm to hold (classically), lm must be of the form

we make the ansatz

lm = gm(p)emr.

lm = emrp

(29)

(30)

and can readily verify that this choice satises the classical virasoro algebra under poisson
brackets. we also note that l
n = ln (classically). this is exactly what we hoped to nd
in order to match our intuition from 1+1 cft.

the next question is whether or not the above system can be quantized. consider the

ansatz

where lm is now a quantum operator. it is clear that l

m = lm. one also sees that

lm = e m

2 rpe m
2 r

[ln, lm] = e n
+ e n

2 r[p, e m
2 rpe m

2 r[e n

2 r]pe m

2 r + e n
2 r + e m

2 re m
2 r[e n

2 re n
2 r, p]e m
n

e n

2 r]e n
2 rp[p, e m

2 rpe n
2 r, p]e m

2 r +

= (n  m)ln+m +

2 r[p, e m

2 r]e n

2 re m

2 re n

2 r[e m

2 r, p]e n
2 r

= (n  m)ln+m.

(31)

(32)

therefore we can conclude that for the free relativistic particle in global time, the virasoro
algebra satises hermiticity and has no central charge.

one may also consider the limit of small ads radius and small m. in that case, we nd

6

take the ansatz

l0 = h = pr2.

lm = pr2e

m

r .

(33)

(34)

again, we can verify that the virasoro algebra does indeed close under poisson brackets. to
quantize this system, we make the ansatz

lm = e

m

2r rpre

m

2r

(35)

as a quantum operator. we then nd that the quantum virasoro algebra closes with no
central charge.

viii. conclusion

it is interesting to note that the ads/cf t correspondence served only as a motivational
tool in the above derivation. the conformal mechanics described above need not be related
to a theory on anti-de sitter space. it is worthwhile to further investigate the relationship
between conformal mechanics and gravity theories on ads2 [11] [12].

additionally, the arguments given above only apply to the mechanics of a single variable.
it would be interesting to conjecture that any conformal mechanics of any arbitrary number
of degrees of freedom contains the symmetries of the virasoro algebra. if true, this would
more closely cement the relationship found in [4] between conformal quantum mechanics
and 1+1 conformal eld theory.

finally, it would very interesting to completely understand the quantization of these
conformal mechanics models. more concretely, one would like to know if there is a way to
determine the central charge and normal-ordering conventions for arbitary scale-invariant
hamiltonians. thus far, all of the systems which we have been able to quantize could be
thought of as describing a limit of a particle in the background of ads2. since the bulk
theory is a two-dimensional quantum gravity theory, the central charge of the bulk virasoro
algebra should vanish (when all ghosts are included). one might speculate that this is the
reason why the central charge of the quantum mechanics has vanished in all cases we have
found. one would like to know if a non-vanishing central charge could perhaps be found for
quantized systems which did not represent a particle in the background of ads2.
