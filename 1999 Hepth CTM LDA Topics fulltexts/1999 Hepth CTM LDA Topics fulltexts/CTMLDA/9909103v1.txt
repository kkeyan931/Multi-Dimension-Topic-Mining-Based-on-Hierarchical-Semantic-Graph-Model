abstract

we derive the analogue of the vanishing of the cosmological constant in 3+1

dimensions, t 0

0 = 0, in terms of an integral over components of the energy-

momentum tensor of a 4 + 1 dimensional universe with parallel three-branes.

the basic ingredients are the existence of a static solution of the einstein equa-

tions, and the compactness of the 5th dimension. the corresponding constraint

is applied to a general action of scalar elds with arbitrary potentials in the

bulk and on the branes. the equations of motion are solved in a linearized

approximation in the 5th dimension, whereupon they require the search for

extrema of an eective potential, which depends nonlinearly on the action

in the bulk and on the branes. the previous constraint then turns into the

vanishing of this eective potential at the extremum.

1 introduction

one of the great puzzles of fundamental physics is the smallness of the cosmolo-

gical constant compared to particle physics scales. from the einstein equations one

nds that the cosmological constant can be interpreted as the expectation value of the

energy moment tensor t (which can be chosen to be proportional to the minkowski

metric , given the observed homogeneity and isotropy of the universe). from the

observed values of the hubble parameter (or the time derivative of the robertson-

walker scale factor), which is tiny compared to particle physics scales, one nds that,

in order to describe our present universe, one has to require

t j

i =(cid:16)t 0

0 (cid:17)  j

,

i

t 0
0 = 0

(in 3 + 1 dimensions)

(1.1a)

(1.1b)

to extreme accuracy. here i, j = 1, 2, 3 denote the 3 spatial components. in classical

eld theory the expectation values of t have to be constructed from the action

and the vacuum solutions of the elds, in quantum eld theory one has to consider

the quantum eective action (or to use quantum mechanical expectation values).

whereas the rst constraint (1.1a) is easy to satisfy, provided only scalar elds have

(homogeneous) vacuum expectation values, the second constraint (1.1b) requires the

vanishing of the scalar potential at the minimum, which corresponds to the puzzle

mentioned above.

motivated, to a large extent, by the m-theory scenario of the strongly coupled
e8  e8 heterotic string [1,2], the cosmology of a universe with three-branes in extra
dimensions has recently been the subject of many investigations [36]. within m-

theory one nds that, below the scale of calabi-yau compactication, our universe

is eectively ve dimensional [1,2,79]. observable and hidden matter lives on three-

branes (3 + 1 dimensional space-times), whereas gravity, moduli elds and elds

originating from a 3-form in 11 dimensions live in the 4 + 1 dimensional bulk, whose

5th dimension is compact.

in the present paper we will derive the analogue of the constraints (1.1), which

are required for a quasi-static universe, for a brane-world. the next section 2 is kept

2

very general: we will just assume that our universe consists of parallel three-branes

in a 4 + 1 dimensional bulk, and allow for an arbitrary dependence of the elds in the

bulk (and hence of the energy momentum tensor) and the components of the metric

on the extra compact 5th dimension. the requirement of a static lorentz invariant

(in 3 + 1 dimensions) solution of the einstein equations then leads to a new constraint

on the energy-momentum tensor in the vacuum, which diers from the constraints

(1.1).

in section 3 we will be somewhat more specic and consider the scenario with 2

three-branes at a distance , and vacuum congurations of scalar elds with arbi-

trary non-linear sigma model metric and potentials in the bulk and on the branes. in

order to solve the equations of motion we resort to a small  limit (specied below),

which allows to expand the elds in powers of the 5th dimension (up to singularities

on the branes). then we are able to turn the constraint on the energy-momentum

tensor in the vacuum into a constraint on the action, which is derived in section 3.

in sections 2 and 3 we check our formulas agains various published scenarios of

static universes. however, our resulting constraint on the energy-momentum tensor

is very general and applies to all particle physics phenomena as, e.g., scenarios for

supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation on a hidden brane.

finally, a brief summary is given in section 4.

2 constraint on the energy-momentum tensor

throughout this paper we consider a (4+1) dimensional universe with coordinates

indexed by (0, 1, 2, 3, 5). the zeroth component corresponds to the time, and the

5th coordinate x5 will often be denoted by y. parallel three-branes will be located at

xed values of y which we denote by by(n), where n indexes the dierent branes. we

are interested in static vacuum congurations of elds and the metric which respect

(3 + 1) dimensional lorentz invariance, hence the elds and the metric can only

depend on the 5th coordinate y. for the ve-dimensional metric we can then choose

ds2 = a2(y)(cid:16)dx2

0 + dxi dxj ij(cid:17) + b2(y) dy2

.

(2.1)

below it will be convenient to write the independent components of the metric as

3

a(y) = e(y)

,

b(y) = e(y)

.

(2.2)

the energy-momentum tensor can be chosen to be diagonal, with non-vanishing

components

below we will decompose the matter action into a part living in the (4+1) dimensional

bulk, and a part living on the n three-branes at by(n). consequently t 0

decomposed into bulk and brane parts, whereas t 5

(2.4a)

t 5

.

(2.4b)

now we consider the einstein equations of a (4 + 1) dimensional universe.

in

the more general non-static case these have been derived by binetruy, deayet and

langlois [4]; in the static case they simplify to (using the notation (2.2))

e(cid:16) + 22  (cid:17) =

2
3

e t 0

,

e 2 =

e t 5

.

(2.5a)

(2.5b)

here primes denote derivatives with respect to y, and  denotes the ve dimen-

sional gravitational constant. the (i, j) components of the einstein equations do not

provide any independent informations. now, from the dierence of eqs. (2.5a) and

(2.5b) one obtains

e(cid:16) + 2  (cid:17) =

2

e(cid:18)t 0

(2.6)

which can be written as

2
3

e+(cid:18)t 0
0 

1
2

t 5

5 (cid:19) .

(2.7)

at this point the compactness of the 5th dimension becomes crucial. we assume

that y is conned into a nite interval i, or, alternatively, that all physical elds as

(y) and (y) are periodic, (y + i) = (y) and (y + i) = (y). consequently the

integral dy over the interval i of the left hand-side of (2.7) vanishes; note that this

argument holds also in the presence of branes, on which the second y-derivatives of

 or  can be singular. returning to the notation a and b instead of  and , and

omitting constant factors, one derives from eq. (2.7)

zi

dy a(y) b(y)(cid:16)2t 0

0  t 5

5 (cid:17) = 0

.

(2.8)

although a topological argument has been used in order to derive eq. (2.8), it

does not represent a general topological constraint: it represents instead a necessary

condition for the existence of a static solution of the einstein equations, i.e. a (practi-

cally) vanishing hubble constant. in this sense eq. (2.8) replaces the four dimensional

constraint (1.1b), the vanishing of the cosmological constant.

if one decomposes the energy-momentum tensor into its bulk and brane parts as

in eqs. (2.4), eq. (2.8) becomes

zi

dy a(y)(b(y) (cid:16)2t (bulk) 0

0  t (bulk) 5

5 (cid:17) + 2xn

(cid:16)y by(n)(cid:17) t (brane n) 0

0 ) = 0 .

(2.9)

trivially, in the absence of a matter action in the bulk and for a single three-brane,

eq. (2.9) collapses to the constraint (1.1b).

next, we would like to express the general constraint (2.8) or (2.9) in terms of

an action involving matter in the bulk and on the branes. since the only possible

lorentz invariant vacuum congurations are y-dependent scalar elds i(y) (up to

duality transformations to 3-forms in 5 dimensions), we will restrict ourselves to

a general non-linear sigma model action (neglecting higher derivatives) with sigma
model metric gij() and arbitrary potentials in the bulk and on the branes. (actually,
in the presence of gauge elds in the bulk, we could also have wilson lines along the

compact 5th dimension. they do, however, not contribute to the energy-momentum

5

tensor).

taking already into account that, in the vacuum, all derivatives of the elds i

except with respect to y vanish, the general action in the bulk and on the branes

reads (using the metric (2.1))

s() = z d5x a4(y)nb(y)(cid:16)gij() yi yj + v (bulk)()(cid:17)

+xn

(cid:16)y by(n)(cid:17) v (brane n)()o .

the (0, 0) and (5, 5) components of the energy-momentum tensor can easily be derived

from eq. (2.10) and inserted into eqs. (2.8) or (2.9). these constraints then become

(2.10)

(2.11)

zi

dy a(y)n3b1(y) gij() yi yj + b(y)v (bulk)()

+2xn

(cid:16)y  by(n)(cid:17) v (brane n)()o = 0

where the elds i(y) (as well as a(y), b(y)) are solutions of the equations of motion.

in the form of eq. (2.11), the general condition for a static universe can be com-

pared to the constraints in more specic scenarios as the non-conventional cosmology

from a brane universe by binetruy, deayet and langlois [4], and the generation of

hierarchies by randall and sundrum [5]. in both cases no scalar elds i exist, i.e. the

rst term in (2.11) vanishes, and the potentials are just constants (with v (bulk) = 0

in [4]). inserting the solution for a(y) (and b(y) = 1) of [5] into (2.11), and using
v (brane 2) = v (brane 1), one obtains indeed the same constraint on the vacuum ener-
gies in the bulk and on the branes as in [5]. likewise, for v (bulk) = 0 only the last term

survives in (2.11), and the resulting constraint agrees with eq. (46) in [4]. (notably, a

static universe had not been assumed in [4] in order to obtain this constraint; there it

follows generally from the solution for a(y) in the presence of 2 three-branes without

an energy-momentum tensor in the bulk).

whereas our previous results (2.8), (2.9) and (2.11) are very general, their practical

application at least in the presence of matter in the bulk is complicated by the fact

that it requires the knowledge of the vacuum solutions for a(y), b(y) and i(y). in

the (3 + 1) dimensional case, the analogous constraint (1.1b) implies the well-known

condition of a vanishing scalar potential at its minimum. likewise, we would like to

6

translate our previous results into a condition on the action (2.10). in the case of 2

three-branes which are suciently close to each other, we are able to derive such a

condition in the next chapter.

3 2 close three-branes

motivated by the compactication of m-theory from 11 to 5 dimensions on a

calabi-yau manifold xcy [1,2,79], we will now consider a 5th dimension with the
geometry of an orbifold s1/z2. we choose y in the interval y  [, ] with the
endpoints being identied. two three-branes are located at by(1) = 0 and by(2) = ,
and the z2 orbifold symmetry acts as y  y.

in this scenario the h1,1 moduli of xcy appear in 5 dimensions as scalar elds i

with non-trivial potentials both in the bulk and on the branes [79]. notably, these
potentials are proportional to coecients i, which are given by integrals of t r r r
over corresponding four-cycles ci in xcy [8]. in general we have

i   with

  o(cid:16)m 4

gu t /m 3

11(cid:17)

,

(3.1)

where m 6

gu t is the inverse size of xcy , and m11 the scale of the eleven-dimensional
in terms of  the potentials of the moduli i are of the

gravitational coupling.

respective orders [8]

v (brane 1)(i) = v (brane 2)(i) = o()

,

v (bulk)(i) = o(2)

.

(3.2a)

(3.2b)

comparing dierent terms in the equations of motion for the elds i(y) (see below)

one then nds that an expansion of i(y) in powers of y converges for

  1

.

(3.3)

a phenomenological motivation for the inequality (3.3) within the m theory sce-

nario can be derived from the relation obtained in [2] between the gauge couplings on

the hidden and observable branes, respectively. given a small value of gu t , (3.3)

7

follows from requiring a small gauge coupling of the e8 gauge symmetry on the hid-

den brane at the scale m11, such that gaugino condensation occurs only at a scale

much below m11 and a susy breaking scale far below mp lanck is generated [7]. on the

other hand, the inequality (3.3) is certainly not strong given the measured value of

newtons constant and the preferred values of gu t and mgu t [2,7].

independently from this possible (and possibly doubtful) phenomenological moti-

vation we will now show how, to lowest non-trivial order in , the constraint derived

in section 2 turns into a constraint on the action. to this end we expand the elds i
and the components of the metric in powers of y (only |y| appears, once one requires
continuity across the second brane, or the elds to be even under the z2 orbifold

symmetry):

0 + i

i(y) = i

1|y| + o(2)
a(y) = a0(cid:16)1 +  a1|y| + o(2)(cid:17)
b(y) = 1 +  b1|y| + o(2)

.

(3.4a)

(3.4b)

(3.4c)

in (3.4c) we have used the freedom in the denition of y such that b(0) = 1. below

we will need the second y derivatives of i(y) and a(y), which are singular on the

branes:

i

(y) = 2 i

1 ((y)  (y  ))

a(y) = 2 a0 a1 ((y)  (y  ))

,

.

(3.5a)

(3.5b)

next we consider the equations of motion of the elds i, as derived from the general

action (2.10):

b(y) gik yi!

(cid:16)y by(n)(cid:17) v (brane n)

,k = 0 .

(3.6)

whereas the terms in the bulk of o(2) in (3.6) determine the terms in i(y) of
quadratic and higher order in y neglected in (3.4a), the singular terms on the branes
of o() including contributions from the second derivatives (3.5a) of i determine
the coecients i

1. using

v (brane 1) = v (brane 2)  v (br)

and (3.5a), the singular terms in (3.6) give

i

1 =

1
4 gik(0) v (br)(0),k

(3.7)

(3.8)

with gikgkj = i
j. (here, as well as in the case of eq. (3.10) below, eq. (3.7) is
required for the consistency of the ansatz (3.4)). hence we have yi  o(), and
the rst two terms in eq. (2.11) are both of o(2). given the orbifold geometry and
eq. (3.7), the last term in eq. (2.11) reads

2a(0) v (br)((0))  2a() v (br) (())

.

(3.9)

in order to evaluate a() to o() we need a1 in eq. (3.4b). as in the case of i
1,
this coecient is obtained from the singular part of the corresponding equation of

motion, i.e. the einstein equation (2.5a) with t 0

0 as in eq. (2.4a). to leading order

in  one nds from (2.5a)

a1 = 

2
6

v (br)(0)

.

(3.10)

finally we can use, in the last term in (3.9),

v (br)(()) = v (br)((0)) +  i

1 v (br)((0)),i + o(3)

= v (br)(0) +

v (br)(0),k gki(0) v (br)(0),i + o(3).(3.11)
terms of o() cancel in (3.9) and hence in eq. (2.11), and the terms of o(2) in eq.
(2.11) read altogether

(3.13)

given the previous approximations, terms of relative order  have been neglected

in eq. (3.13).

it remains to determine the constant modes i

0 from the scalar equations of motion
(3.6). to this end we multiply eq. (3.6) with a4(y) (which brings it back to its original

form) and integrate over the compact interval i, whereupon the second term in (3.6)

vanishes. thus eq. (3.6) turns into

now we treat eq. (3.14) as the constraint (2.11) before, i.e. we insert the ansatze

the equations of motion of the constant modes i

dimensional cosmological constant, i.e. the left hand-sides of eqs. (2.8), (2.9), (2.11)

or (3.13), are required to vanish. however, we recall again that eqs. (3.13) and (3.15)

have been derived using the linearized solutions (3.4) in the bulk, and are subject to
corrections of o(). (within this approximation it is amusing to note that the rst
two terms in (3.13) and (3.15) show some formal similarity to the scalar potential

in supergravity in d = 4, once v (br) is identied with the superpotential, although

10

no reference to supersymmetry has ever been made in its derivation. we have no

explanation for this fact at present).

finally we will apply our results to the sigma model action of the universal calabi-

yau modulus, using the formulation in [8] (the corresponding eld has been called v

there, but we will denote it by ). an exact static solution to the einstein equations

and the  equations of motion has been obtained in [8], but of course our approximate

equations (3.13) and (3.15) should also apply. indeed, in our notation the action of

the single scalar eld  is described by

(g())1 = 422

,

v (br)() = 

2
2

v (bulk)() =

622

(3.16)

and one nds that the left hand-side of eq. (3.13), and hence the parenthesis in eq.

(3.15), vanish identically in 0. this results agrees with the presence of arbitrary

integration constants in the solution of [8], some combination of which has been xed

by our convention b(0) = 1.

4 summary and conclusions

in the present paper we have derived the analogue of the vanishing of the cos-

mological constant in 3 + 1 dimensions, t 0

0 = 0, in terms of the energy-momentum
tensor in the vacuum of a 4 + 1 dimensional brane-universe. the corresponding

general constraint takes the form of eqs. (2.8) or (2.9), and its application requires

as in the 3 + 1 dimensional case the knowledge of the solutions of the equations of

motion. in the case of a general action of scalar elds with arbitrary potentials in

the bulk and on the branes, these solutions cannot be obtained explicitly. they can

still be constructed, however, in the linearized approximation, where only a linear

dependence of the elds and the metric in the 5th coordinate y is taken into account.

this ansatz can be motivated in the m-theory scenario, where the scalar elds in

4+1 dimensions arise as moduli of the calabi-yau space: first, one obtains the mirror

symmetry (3.7) among the potentials on the two three-branes, which is required for

the consistency of this ansatz, and second, the potentials involve dimensionful para-
meters i  , which allow to dene a consistent dimensionless expansion parameter
.

11

within this approximation we have found that the equations of motion of the cons-

tant modes i

0 of the scalar elds in the bulk correspond to the search for extrema
of an eective potential, which has to be constructed in terms of the potentials

on the branes, and the potential and the non-linear sigma model metric in the bulk.

the necessary condition for a static 4 + 1 dimensional brane-universe then becomes

the condition of a vanishing eective potential at the extremum, in analogy to the

3 + 1 dimensional case. clearly we expect to nd more consequences of our general

constraint derived in section 2, beyond the linearized approximation.
