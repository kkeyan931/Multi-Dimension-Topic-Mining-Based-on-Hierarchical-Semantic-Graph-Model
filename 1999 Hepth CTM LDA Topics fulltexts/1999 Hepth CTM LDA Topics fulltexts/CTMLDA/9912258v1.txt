1 introduction

several kinds of matrix model have been proposed[1, 2, 3, 4] to study the nonperturbative
aspects of string theory or m theory. these proposals are based on the developments of d-
branes. they have been shown to play a fundamental role in nonperturbative string theory[5,
6]. notable point is that supersymmetric gauge theory can be obtained on their world-volume
as their low energy eective theory. the idea of matrix models is that supersymmetric gauge
theory can describe string or m theory.

iib matrix model is one of these proposals[2].

it is a large n reduced model[7] of
ten-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills theory. it is postulated that it gives the con-
structive denition of type iib superstring theory. it is crucial that this model has n = 2
supersymmetry because it guarantees the existence of gravitons.
recently, noncommutative yang-mills theory has been studied in many situations. it rst
appeared within the framework of toroidal compactication of matrix theory[8]. the world
volume theory on d-branes with ns-ns two-form background is described by noncommuta-
tive yang-mills theory[9]. it was shown[10] that in matrix model picture noncommutative
yang-mills theory is equivalent to twisted reduced model[11]. in iib matrix model, twisted
reduced model is obtained as expanding the model around noncommutative backgrounds. a
noncommutative background is a d-brane-like background which is a solution of equation of
motion and preserves a part of supersymmetry. it is well known that gauge theory is realized
in the world-volume of d-branes as their low energy eective theory. in iib matrix model,
gauge theory is realized as twisted reduced model. the remarkable point is that there is a
relation between the coordinate space and the momentum space. further researches about
noncommutative yang-mills were done in [12] using the property of twisted reduced model.
the behaviors of wilson loop operators in the large momentum scale region and the small
momentum scale region are studied. in small momentum scale region wilson loops are the
ones in ordinary gauge theory while in large momentum scale region wilson loops become
open string like objects. it was pointed out that there was a crossover at noncommutative
scale.

in this paper, we study iib matrix model with d1-d5 backgrounds. the d1-d5 back-
ground is an interesting conguration since it is used by strominger and vafa[13] in order
to study the microscopic interpretation of the black hole entropy. it is further studied by
maldacena[14] as ads/cf t correspondence. the organization of this paper is as follows. in
section 2, we review the relation between noncommutative yang-mills and iib matrix model.
noncommutative yang-mills is equivalent to twisted reduced model. twisted reduced model
is dened by the expansion around a d-brane-like background in iib matrix model. in sec-
tion 3, we consider d1-d5 backgrounds. for their description, we divide matrices into four
parts. the upper left part and the lower right part represent d1-branes and d5-branes re-
spectively. the remaining parts represent the interactions of them. in string theory picture,
o-diagonal parts represent the states appearing as open strings connecting d1-branes and
d5-branes. we examine the spectrum of this matrix model. the spectrum of open strings
connecting d1-branes and d5-branes in string theory is discussed in [9]. comparison with
string theory results is mentioned. we also consider another description of d1-branes as

2

local excitations of gauge theory on the world-volume of d5-branes. this description gives
the description of d1-branes bounded to d5-branes. the counting of the zero modes is also
discussed.
in section 4, we mention the relation to supergravity solutions. the relation
between supergravity and gauge theory is formulated as ads/cf t correspondence[14]. b-
eld background eect changes the behaviors of gauge theory, while supergravity solutions
are also changed[15, 16].
interactions in very far region from branes, at spacetime, are
described by the cluster property in matrix model. in near horizon region (so called ads
region) gauge theory description can be used. we consider ads3  s3  m 4 background in
matrix model. ads5  s5 background is investigated in [10, 12]. section 5 is devoted to
conclusions and discussions.

2 noncommutative yang-mills in iib matrix model

in this section, we review iib matrix model[2, 17] and its relation to noncommutative

yang-mills which is equal to twisted reduced model[10, 12].

iib matrix model is dened by the following action

s = 

1

g2 t r(cid:18)1

[a, a] [a, a] +

 [a, ](cid:19) .

(1)

here  is a ten dimensional majorana-weyl spinor eld, and a and  are n  n hermitian
matrices. this model is the large n reduced model of ten-dimensional n =1 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory. this is based on the observation that a large n gauge theory is equivalent
to its reduced model[7]. this model has the following symmetries:

and

and translation symmetry:

(1) =

i

[a, a] 

(1)a = i,

(2) = 
(2)a = 0,

a = c1.

(2)

(3)

(4)
(5)

(6)

if we interpret the eigenvalues of a as the space-time coordinates, we can regard the above
symmetry as n = 2 supersymmetry. we take a linear combination of (1) and (2) as

(1) = (1) + (2)
(2) = i(cid:16)(1)  (2)(cid:17) ,





we can obtain n = 2 supersymmetry algebra:
(i)
 (cid:17)  = 0,

(j)
  (j)

(cid:16)(i)

(7)

(j)
  (j)
the equation of motion of (1) with  = 0 is

(cid:16)(i)





(i)
 (cid:17) a = 2iij

[a, [a, a]] = 0.

(8)

(9)

the solution in which [a, a] = c-number is an interesting solution because it is a bps
background. that is, half of the supersymmetry is preserved in this background. this
corresponds to a d-brane background.

we expand the theory around the following classical solution,

[p, p] = ib,

(10)

where b is anti-symmetric tensor and c-number. this is a solution of (9) and is a bps
background. we assume the rank of b to be d and dene its inverse c  in d dimensional
subspace. p satisfy the canonical commutation relations and span the d dimensional phase
space. the volume of the phase space is vp = n(2) d/2detb.

we expand a = p + a and fourier-decompose a and  as

a(k) exp(ic k p),

(k) exp(ic k p).

(11)

(12)

a = xk
 = xk

exp(ic k p) is the eigenstate of p = [p,] with eigenvalue k. the hermiticity requires
that a(k) = a(k) and (k) = (k). let  be the extension of each p. the volume
of one quantum in this phase space is  d/n =  d where  is the spacing of the quanta, say,
noncommutative scale. b , which is the component of b, is related to  as b = 2/2.
 = /n2/ d = /n1/ d. the range of k is restricted as
k is quantized in the unit of kmin
n1/ d/2  k  n1/ d/2.

consider the map from a matrix to a function as

under this map, we obtain the following map,

a  a(x) = xk

a(k) exp(ikx).

ab  a(x)  b(x),

where  is the star product dened as follows,

a(x)  b(x)  exp  ic

! a(x + )b(x + ) |==0 .

t r over matrices can be mapped on the integration over functions as

(16)

using these rules, the adjoint operator of p + a is mapped to the covariant derivative:

[p + a, o] 

1
i

o(x) + a(x)  o(x)  o(x)  a(x)  [d, o(x)] .

(17)

noncommutative yang-mills action can be obtained by applying the above rules. al-
though we have discussed the momentum space, the coordinate space is also embedded in
the matrices of twisted reduced model through the relation x = c  p. this relation
says that the coordinate space is related to the momentum space. this relation reminds us
t-duality.

3 the gauge theory of d1-d5 system in iib matrix

model

following the rules of the previous section, we consider iib matrix model with d1-d5
backgrounds. we use the coordinate space description instead of the dual momentum space.
d1-d5-brane solutions are constructed by preparing the following matrices[2, 18, 19],

x0 =

x1 =

where [q, p] = i, [q, p] = i, [q, p] = i. d1-brane and d5-brane are constituted of nd1(= n1)
quanta of the volume l2
n c respectively, where
t l1 = nd1l2
ln c = 2/ is the noncommutative length
scale.

n c and nd5(= n1n2n3) quanta of the volume l6

n c and t l1l2l3l4l5 = nd5l6

n c.

x satisfy the commutation relation such as

[x, x] = ic  ,
n c = (2/)2. in iib matrix model, the d-brane is
where c 01 = c 23 = c 45 = 2/b = l2
interpreted as not pure one but one with non-vanishing gauge eld strength b[20]. they

(19)

5

are equivalent to the branes in the presence of a constant ns-ns two-form background b
3.

we expand the model around the classical background, acl

 , and the uctuation is denoted

by x,

a = acl

 + x.

(20)

we align a d1-brane along the 0, 1 directions and a d5-brane along the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 direc-
tions:

 =   x 0
=   0 0
=   u 0
x =   a c

0 x! ( = 0, 1)
0 x! ( = 2, 3, 4, 5)
0 0! ( = 6, 7, 8, 9)
b! .

acl

c

(21)

(22)

these acl
 satisfy the equation of motion (9). the upper left part and the lower right
part of matrices represent a d1-brane and a d5-brane respectively. the remaining parts of
matrices represent the interactions of them. u are the positions of d1-branes in the 6,7,8,9
directions. we will use the indices ,  as the indices running over the direction parallel to
the branes and a, b as the indices over the direction transverse to the branes. we replace a
and b with c a(x) and c b(x) in our correspondence (13), where a(x) and b(x) can
be interpreted as gauge elds. we also replace aa, bb and c with (1/b)aa(x), (1/b)bb(x)
and (1/b)c(x).

we can consider multiple branes by replacing x  x  1q1 or x  1q5. q1 and q5 are
the number of d1-branes and d5-branes respectively. we call this system d1-d5 system.
this system is described by two-dimensional4 supersymmetric u(q1)  u(q5) gauge theory
in low energy limit. a are q1  q1 hermitian matrices and transform as adjoints of u(q1).
b are q5  q5 hermitian matrices and transform as adjoints of u(q5). c are q1  q5
matrices and transform as the product of the fundamental representation of u(q1) and the
anti-fundamental representation of u(q5). c are the complex conjugate of c. a, c and
c are two-dimensional elds while b are six-dimensional elds.

we examine the condition whether this background is supersymmetric:

(1) =

i
2

[a, a] 

3this is the conguration considered in [9]
4 to describe the compact space, we impose the following condition for the matrices,

a + 2r =  a



(,  = 2, 3, 4, 5)

where  are unitary matrices and r are compactication radii.  dont commute for the noncommutative
torus [8].

(2) = .

(23)

we nd that the following conditions are needed for this conguration to be supersymmetric:

c 0101 = ,

2345 = .

(24)

therefore one fourth of the supersymmetry are preserved in this conguration. this theory
has n = (4, 4) supersymmetry in two dimensions.
part action with c = 0 can be easily calculated and become

we now consider twisted reduced model action with the d1-d5 backgrounds. the bosonic

where d is the covariant derivative constructed by the gauge elds a( = 0, 1) while d
is the covariant derivative constructed by the gauge elds b( = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). tr is taken
over the color indices.  means that products are not usual ones but the ones dened by
(15). we have just considered the situation that d1-branes are overlapping and also that
d5-branes are overlapping. by replacing left upper part of acl
2  1q1 (i = color
index) which is the positions of d1-branes in the x2 direction, we can obtain the case that
d1-branes are separated in x2 direction. this makes a eld massive. other cases can be
done in the same way.

we next consider c and c elds. it corresponds to the states appearing in (1, 5) and
(5, 1) string5 in string theory picture. we ignore the interaction terms. after the gauge

where 1 = 12(c2 + ic3), 2 = 12(c2 ic3), 3 = 12(c4 + ic5) and 4 = 12(c4 ic5). u 2 is the
distance between d1-branes and d5-branes. these mass terms mean that a eld appearing
in the string connecting two branes has a mass proportional to the distance between two
branes in string picture. we can say that only 2 and 4 can be massless scalar at the ground
state (m = 0 or n = 0) and u 2 = 0 while 1,3 and c( 6= 2, 3, 4, 5) are always massive
because of the zero point energy. only four real degrees of freedom are massless degrees of
freedom.

we next examine the fermionic part. we divide matrices into four parts in the same way

as the bosonic part. fermionic background is set to zero.

where  = , and  = 0, 1,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  = 2, 3, 4, 5, and  = 6, 7, 8, 9. we
consider the massless conditions for 3 and 3. mass terms are given by the fourth and
fth terms of (29). therefore the massless conditions for 3 and 3 are  x3 = 0 and
 x3 = 0 and u = 0. we rewrite  x = 0 as

(2 + i3)(cid:16)x2  ix3(cid:17) + (2  i3)(cid:16)x2 + ix3(cid:17)

+ (4 + i5)(cid:16)x4  ix5(cid:17) + (4  i5)(cid:16)x4 + ix5(cid:17) = 0.

from the commutation relation (19), we can make annihilation-creation operators:

a23  s b
a23  s b

2 (cid:16)x3  ix2(cid:17)

(31)

(32)

ha23, a23i = 1.

annihilation-creation operators for x4 and x5 also can be made in the same way. so the
following conditions are needed for 3 and 3 to be massless:

a23|30i = 0
a45|30i = 0
(2 + i3)|a2330i = 0
(4 + i5)|a4530i = 0.

(33)

last two conditions say that one fourth of 3 components survive.
in other words, the
massless mode of 3 fermion has eight components. we have seen that massless mode of c
has real four degrees of freedom. both c and 3 transform as the product of the fundamental
of u(q1) and anti-fundamental of u(q5), i.e. these are super-partners. since the massless
physical degrees of freedom of 3 are four, they are same with the massless degrees of freedom
of c.

we compare these results with string theory results. o-diagonal elements of matrices
correspond to (1, 5) or (5, 1) string. superstring theory is usually formulated in the ramond-
neveu-schwarz formalism, while matrix model is formulated in the green-schwarz formalism.
we examine the spectrum of (1, 5)-string in the presence of b eld by the ramond-neveu-
schwarz formalism. in the r sector, the zero point energy is zero, because world-sheet bosons
and world-sheet fermions have the same moding. the massless spectrum is not aected by
a b eld. there are four periodic world-sheet fermions in the nn and dd directions (0,1
directions are not counted ). so, there are four zero modes. these zero modes generate
24/2 = 4 ground states. after imposing the gso projection, two of the four ground states
survive. there are also the contribution from (5, 1) string. therefore there appear four
massless modes, which correspond to the massless modes of 2 and 4, from the r sector.
in the ns sector, the massless spectrum is aected by the b eld. the zero point energy
has the dependence of the value of the b eld. the spectrum is discussed in [9] about
the case of the d0-d4 system. same discussions are applied to the d1-d5 system. for
large b23 and b45, a d5-brane is regarded as to be constituted of innitely d1-branes or
anti-d-branes. according to [9], the spectrums are dierent in these cases. (from the open
string stretching between d-string and anti-d-string, tachyon state appears. so this system
is unstable and not supersymmetric.) the case which is considered in this paper is the
former case in which this system is supersymmetric. in this case, total four massless modes,
which correspond to the massless modes of 3, appear from the ns sector after imposing

9

the gso projection. from these facts, we conclude that the number of massless modes for
the o-diagonal elements in matrix model matches the number of massless modes for (1,5)
and (5,1) string.

we now consider the description of d1-branes embedded in d5-branes. we are interested
in d1-d5 bound states because these states are associated with the dynamics of the black
hole[13].
it can be shown that the instantons of u(q5) gauge theory on the d5-branes
carry r-r two-form charge and d1-branes considered in the previous part of this section
correspond to the zero size limit of the instantons. therefore q1 d1-branes embedded in
d5-brane are constructed as q1 instantons in u(q5) gauge theory[21, 22]. we now look at
the chern-simon coupling in d5-brane action:

trz6

c2  f2  f2

where c2 is the r-r two form eld and f2 is the gauge eld strength.
in this coupling,
f  f plays the role of d1-brane charge. in general, lower-dimensional d-branes embedded
in higher-dimensional d-branes are expressed as the magnetic ux on higher-dimensional
d-branes[23].

we consider u(q5) gauge theory on d5-branes with a self-dual gauge eld strength on

t 4 in matrix model.

the size of the right lower part of matrices are 2  2. the size of the left upper part of
matrices are (q5  2)  (q5  2). the equation of motion in iib matrix model is given by
(9). after the replacements from matrices to functions, the equation of motion of this gauge
theory become

h d,h d, dii = 0

(,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

(36)

we analyze the situation that only gauge elds b(2)
 have nontrivial classical solutions. in
other words, we embed an (anti-)instanton into su(2) part (right lower part). the instanton
solution 6 can be constructed as follows,



f (2)

f (2)

f (2)

(37)

6 instantons on non-commutative r4 space are constructed in [24].

10

where ,  = 2, 3, 4, 5 and ,  = 0, 1.  means the dual tensor on t 4. the star product which
is dened in (15) is used in these equations. f (2) is the gauge eld strength constructed by
the gauge eld b(2). self-dual and anti-self-dual congurations are referred to instantons and
anti-instantons respectively. in d-brane picture, the winding number of instanton represents
the d1-brane charge. therefore to express q1 d1-branes on d5-branes, we set the following
condition:

q1 =

82 trzt 4

f (2)  f (2).

(38)

also, d5-branes carry d3-branes charge. therefore we also need the following condition to
obtain pure d1-d5 bound states, i.e. no d3-branes:

in these congurations, supersymmetry transformations (2) and (4) are given as follows:

be supersymmetric:

2345 = .

we study the zero mode.

it is known that the second chern number is equal to the
dierence in the number of the chiral fermion zero modes whose chiralities are positive and
negative (the index theorem). the dierence of the chiral fermions is given by v q1[25],
where v is the dynkin index depending on the representation and q1 is dened in (38).
we expect that chiral fermions appear from the o-diagonal parts and the right lower part.
these parts transform as the fundamental and adjoints of su(2) respectively. in these cases,
v is 1 and 4 respectively. therefore q1q5 chiral fermion zero modes appear from the index
theorem. from the condition (33), the zero mode of 3 satises 234530 = 30. this
implies that 30 has negative chirality as a so(4) (the rotation of x2, x3, x4, x5) weyl spinor.
we notice that this chirality is opposite to the spinor which satisfy the condition of unbroken
supersymmetry (see (41)). the reason is that these zero modes are goldstone modes. the
degrees of freedom of these zero modes is associated with the dynamics of the black hole
entropy[13].

in this section, we would like to study the supergravity solution in iib matrix model. the
relevant supergravity solution to matrix model is supergravity solution with b eld since
the d-brane in matrix model is not pure one but one with b background. the alignment
of d1-branes and d5-branes is same with the previous section. x2, x3, x4, x5, directions
are compactied on a torus t 4. this gives black string solution if q1 and q5 are large.
we will work out in euclidean space. the supergravity solution of d1-d5 system with the
b elds which have non-zero components along all the directions parallel to the branes
can be obtained likewise as in [26, 16]. the procedure is as follows. we apply t-duality
transformation in the x1 direction in a usual d1-d5 system. this gives d0-d4 bound states.
then we rotate the (x0, x1)-plane with a rotation angle . now we consider making the t-
duality transformation in the x1 (this is a rotated coordinate) direction. this gives the mixed
boundary condition in the x0, x1 directions. in this t-duality transformation, b01 = tan  is
induced along the x0, x1 directions. by applying the same procedure in the x2, x3 and x4,
x5 directions, we obtain the following solution7:

we consider the region which is very far from branes, that is, r is very large. the
spacetime become the at space-time. we can ignore the b eect (i.e. noncommutativity)
in this region. in such a region, the interactions are described as the interactions between
diagonal blocks using the cluster property[2, 10] in matrix model. we consider the instanton
and (anti-)instanton pair, each is in d5-brane, and the situation that their distance is very

far. instanton conguration in d5-brane is discussed at the last part in the previous section.
we embed d1-d5 bound states in the left upper part of matrices and the other d1-d5 bound
states in the left upper part of matrices. the exchange of gravitons, dilatons and axions can
be seen similar to d3-d(1) case[10]. the interaction potential between instantons vanish
because this system is bps saturated. on the other hand, graviton exchange can be seen in
the instanton and anti-instanton case[10].

it is conjectured by maldacena[14] that two-dimensional cft describing the higgs branch
of d1-d5 system on m 4 is dual to iib string on ads3  s3  m 4.
in the spirit of this
relation, supergravity solution dual to noncommutative yang-mills is studied by maldacena
and russo[16], hashimoto and itzhaki[15]. solution dual to two-dimensional gauge theory
on d1-d5-branes with b eld is obtained by taking the near horizon limit in the solution

where g = gb(r1/r5)2 is the string coupling in the ir region. from the perspective of
gauge theory, radial coordinate u is interpreted as energy scale. in the ir region, this metric
represents ads3  s3  m 4. the string coupling constant depends on the energy scale. the
string coupling decrease as the energy scale grows. this is the same behavior with one in
ads5  s5 which behaves like the twisted reduced model [10]. the behavior of the dilaton is

theory is two-dimensional [27].

in iib matrix model, curved spacetime is thought to be given by assuming the following

eigenvalue distribution[28],

h(x)i  ge(x),

in only ads3 part. this is invariant under u  1/a2u as expected. this eigenvalue
distribution has a peak at u = 1/a while ordinary ads has a peak at u =  (i.e. boundary).

5 discussions

in this paper, we have considered d1-d5 system in iib matrix model. using the equiva-
lence between twisted reduced model and noncommutative yang-mills, we studied the two-
dimensional gauge theory on d1-d5 system. twisted reduced model is obtained by the
expansion around the noncommutative background. d1-d5 background is supersymmetric
and one fourth of the supersymmetry survive. we discussed the spectrum of the elds, es-
pecially the elds which appear in the o-diagonal parts of matrices. they correspond to
the state which appear in (1, 5) or (5, 1) open string. we showed that only four degrees of
freedom can be massless modes. this fact coincides with string theory result. d1-branes
embedded in d5-branes are expressed as nontrivial solutions, instantons, in six-dimensional
gauge theory on d5-branes. we also considered the zero modes of the instanton cong-
uration. the topological charge of the instanton is related to the existence of the chiral
fermion zero modes by the index theorem. it was shown that there were q1q5 so(4) weyl
fermions as the zero modes. these degrees of freedom play an important role in the black
hole physics. we also considered the anti-instanton solution which is interpreted as and an
anti-d1-brane embedded in a d5-brane. the anti-d1-brane background is constructed by
replacing x1 with -x1 in (21). we can understand that anti-d1-brane and d5-brane system is
unstable because this system is not supersymmetric. we can check it as follows. we obtain
c 01301 = 122 instead of the rst condition in (24). it is impossible to nd the spinors
which satisfy this condition. however, an anti-d1-brane can dissolve in a d5-brane and it
is described as anti-instanton in the gauge theory on d5-brane. we have shown that this
anti-instanton solution is supersymmetric, so this system can be stable as the bound state.
in section 4, we discussed the supergravity solution which is dual to the gauge theory
of the d1-d5 system in matrix model.
in [10], d-instantons were constructed as local
excitations of gauge theory on d3-branes. it was also shown that d-instantons couple to
gravity by considering the interactions between diagonal blocks. in this paper, we considered
d1-brane solutions as local excitations of gauge theory on d5-branes. in matrix model, d1-
brane is expressed by innitely many d-instantons. therefore the interactions between
d1-branes and (anti-)d1-branes can be viewed as the interactions between innitely many
d-instantons and (anti-)d-instantons.
