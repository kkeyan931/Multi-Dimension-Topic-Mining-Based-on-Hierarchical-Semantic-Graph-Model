abstract

the su(2) collective coordinates quantization of the born-infeld
skyrmions lagrangean is performed. the obtainment of the classi-
cal hamiltonian from this special lagrangean is made by using an ap-
proximate way: it is derived from the expansion of this non-polynomial
lagrangean up to second-order variable in the collective coordinates,
using for this some causality arguments. because this system presents
constraints, we use the dirac hamiltonian method and the faddeev-
jackiw lagrangean approach to quantize this model.

until this moment, the skyrme model[1] is the eective eld theory for

baryons and their interactions. these hadronic particles are described from

soliton solutions in the non-linear sigma model. in this lagrangean, normally,

it is necessary to add the skyrme term to stabilize the soliton solutions. the

physical spectrum is obtained by performing the collective coordinates quan-

tization. then, using the nucleon and the delta masses as input parameters,

we get the principal phenomenological results[2].

in principle, the skyrme term is arbitrary, having no concrete reason to

x this particular choice[3]. its importance resides in the fact that, maybe,

it is the most simple possible quartic derivative term that we need to put in
the static hamiltonian to obtain the soliton solution1. however, it is possible

to get round this ambiguity by adopting a non-conventional lagrangean also

based in a non-linear sigma model, given by

l = f z d3r t r huu +i

3

2 ,

(1)

where f is the pion decay constant and u is an su(2) matrix. this model

was proposed by deser, du and isham[5], based on the ideas of born-infeld

electrodynamics[6]. applying derrick theorem in the static hamiltonian (de-

rived from the lagrangean (1) ) we observe the existence of soliton solution.

the purpose of this paper is to apply both dirac hamiltonian method[7]

and the faddeev-jackiw lagrangean procedure[11] to obtain the commuta-

tors between the canonical operators in which will dene the quantum struc-

ture of the born-infeld skyrmions system[8]. we will observe that when we

keep the non-causality sector of the soliton solution inuencing the physical

values as minimum as possible, the commutators obtained are the same of

1 according to derrick scale theorem[4].

the skyrme model.

the dynamic system will be given by performing the su(2) collective
semi-classical expansion[2]. substituting u(r, t) by a(t)u(r)a+(t) in (1),

where a is an su(2) matrix, we obtain

l = f z d3r hm  i t r(0a0a1)i

2 .

(2)

in the last equation, m and i are some functional of the chiral angle f (r),
with the topological boundary conditions, f (0) =  and f () = 0. here,
we use the hedgehog ansatz for u, i.e., u = exp(i  rf (r)). the su(2)
matrix a can be written as a = a0 + ia   , with the constraint

i=3

xi=0

aiai = 1.

the lagrangean (2) can be written as a function of the ai as

l = f z d3r [m  i ai ai]

3

2 .

from the eq. (4) we can obtain the conjugate momentum given by

i =

l
 ai

= 3f ai z d3ri [m  i ak ak]

2 .

(3)

(4)

(5)

the algebraic expression for the hamiltonian is obtained by applying the
legendre transformation, h = i ai  l . however, due to the momentum
formula given in eq. (5), maybe it is not possible to write the conjugate

hamiltonian in terms of i and ai for the lagrangean of the born-infeld

skyrmions. an alternative procedure is to expand the original lagrangean

(4) in collective coordinates variables. thus, considering the binomial ex-

pansion variable

i
m ai ai , the lagrangean sum is given by

j.a.neto, w.oliveira and e.r.oliveira, operatorial quantization of. . .

in this step we would like to give a physical argument that permits the use

of this procedure. this model is not relativistic invariant. thus, we hope that

only soliton velocity much smaller than speed of light can reproduce, with

a good accordance, the experimental physical results. from the relation[9],

a+0a = i/2pk=3
k=1 kk, where k is the uniform soliton angular velocity,
it is possible to show that t r[0a0a+] = 2 ai ai = 2/2. if we want that
the soliton rotates with velocity smaller than c, then r  1, leading to
ai ai = 2
4  1, and consequently ai ai  1 for all space2. thus, these results

explain our procedure.

the hamiltonian is obtained by using the legendre transformation

h = i ai  l

= m + a( ai ai)  3b( ai ai)2 + . . . .

(11)

2in the context of semi-classical expansion, it is expected that the product of

ai ai by
m given by the euler-lagrange equation, does not modify sensitively this

the expression i
result.

j.a.neto, w.oliveira and e.r.oliveira, operatorial quantization of. . .

obtaining the momentum, i = l
(6), writing the the la-
 ai
grangean as, l = i ai  h, and comparing with the expansion of the la-
grangean (6), it is possible to derive the expression of the hamiltonian (11)

, from eq.

as

h = m +  ii +  (ii)2 + . . . ,

(12)

being  = 1
16a4 ( a and b are dened in eqs.(8) and (9) respec-
tively). we will truncate the expression (12) in the second order variable3 ,

4a ,  = b

and we will use this approximate hamiltonian to perform the quantization.

in order to apply the dirac hamiltonian method, we need to look for

secondary constraints, in which can be calculate by constructing the following

hamiltonian

ht = h + 11

= m +  ii +  (ii)2 + 1(aiai  1),

(13)

where 1 is the lagrangean multiplier. imposing that the primary constraint

(3) must be conserved in time, we have

1 = {1, ht} = 0,

(14)

where 1 = aiai1  0 is the primary constraint. the consistency condition
over the constraint (3) leads to

3 due to the equation(5) together with the fact that ai ai  1 , we expect that terms
like (ii)3 or higher order degree do not alter our conclusion about the commutators of
the quantum born-infeld skyrmions.

j.a.neto, w.oliveira and e.r.oliveira, operatorial quantization of. . .

1 = {1, ht} = {aiai  1, m + jj + (jj)2}
= (4 + 8jj)aii.

(15)

as the quantity inside the parenthesis, formula (15), can not be a negative

value, then we get the secondary constraint

aii = 0, 2 = aii  0.

(16)

if one goes on and imposing the consistency condition over (16), we observe

that no new constraints are obtained via this iterative procedure. the theory

has then the constraints

1 = aiai  1  0,
2 = aii  0,

(17)

(18)

which are second class ones. to implement the dirac brackets we need to

calculate the matrix elements of their poisson brackets, read as

c = {, }

= 2 aiai, ,  = 1, 2,

with 12 = 12 = 1. using the dirac bracket

{a, b} = {a, b}  {a, }c 1

{, b},

we obtain

{ai, aj} = 0,
{ai, j} = ij  aiaj,
{i, j} = aji  aij.

(22)

(23)

(24)

by means of the well known canonical quantization rule { , }  i [ , ], we
get the commutators

[ai, aj] = 0,

[ai, j] = i (ij  aiaj) ,
[i, j] = i (aji  aij) .

(25)

(26)

(27)

these results show that the quantum mechanics commutators of the born-

infeld skyrmions, when we expand its lagrangean until to the second order

in collective coordinates, are equal to the skyrme model[10].

to implement the faddeev-jackiw quantization procedure[12], let us con-

sider the rst-order lagrangean

where the potential v is

l = i ai  v,

v = m + ii + (ii)2 + (aiai  1),

(28)

(29)

with the sympletic enlarged variables given by j = (aj, j, ). to obtain the

poisson brackets, we need to determine the sympletic tensor, dened by

fij =

aj
i 

ai
j .

(30)

j.a.neto, w.oliveira and e.r.oliveira, operatorial quantization of. . .

ai are functions of the sympletic variable  . from the lagrangean(28), we

identify the coecients

aai = i,

ai = 0,

a = 0,

(31)

the sympletic tensor is calculate using the denition (30) with the coecients

above leading to the matrix f

(32)

where the elements of rows and columns follow the order: ai, i, . the

matrix above is obviously singular. thus, the system has constraints in

the faddeev-jackiw formalism. the eigenvector corresponding to the zero

eigenvalue is

v =

the primary constraint is obtained from

(1) = vi

v
ai

= aiai  1  0,

(33)

(34)

where the potential v is given by eq. (29). taking the time derivative of

this constraint and introducing the result into the previous lagrangean by
means of a lagrange multiplier , we get a new lagrangean l(1)

j.a.neto, w.oliveira and e.r.oliveira, operatorial quantization of. . .

where

l(1) = (i + ai) ai  v (1),

v (1) = m + ii + (ii)2.

j.a.neto, w.oliveira and e.r.oliveira, operatorial quantization of. . .  10

here we must mention that the primary and secondary constraints, eqs(34)

and (40), respectively, derived by the faddeev-jackiw procedure are the same

obtained by the dirac formalism. taking the time derivative of this constraint

and introducing the result into the lagrangean (35) by means of a lagrange
multiplier , we get a new lagrangean l(2)

l(2) = (i + ai + i) ai + ai i  v (2),

(41)

where v (2) = v (1). the new sympletic enlarged variables are j = (aj, j,

, ). the new coecients are

a(2)

ai = i + ai + i,

a(2)

i = ai,

a(2)

 = 0,

a(2)

 = 0.

and the matrix f (2) read as

f (2) =




0 ij ai i

(42)

where rows and columns follow the order: ai, i, . the matrix f (2) is not

singular. then we can identify it as the sympletic tensor of the constrained
theory. the inverse of f (2) will give us the dirac brackets of the physical

elds and can be obtained in a straightforward calculation. the resulting

inverse matrix is

from the matrix (f (2))1 we identify the nonvanishing brackets

{ai, aj} = 0,
{ai, j} = ij  aiaj,
{i, j} = aji  aij.

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

then, by means of the well known canonical quantization rule { , } 
i [ , ], we obtain the commutators

[ai, aj] = 0,

[ai, j] = i (ij  aiaj) ,
[i, j] = i (aji  aij) .

(47)

(48)

(49)

we observe that the brackets above, derived by faddeev-jackiw lagrangean

procedure, are the same obtained by using the dirac hamiltonian theory.

finalizing, when we treat the born-infeld skyrmions lagrangean, approx-

imating it by a nite second-order sum in the rotational modes variables, we

veried that its quantum structure, given by the commutators, are the same

obtained in the conventional skyrme model quantization. the expansion of

the non-polynomial born-infeld lagrangean in terms of dynamic variables is

possible if we pay attention to the problem of breaking the relativistic invari-

ance in the collective coordinates expansion. the non-causal soliton solution

j.a.neto, w.oliveira and e.r.oliveira, operatorial quantization of. . .  12

contributions to the physical parameters are not relevant if the chiral angle
f(r) satised the relation, f (r)  0, in the limit, r  , together with the
fact that we impose the soliton angular velocity small, i.e.,   1. thus,
taking the angular soliton solution, , as an expansion parameter, and main-

taining the non-causal soliton sector contributions as minimum as possible,

we conclude that the quantum commutators of the born-infeld skyrmions

move towards to the conventional skyrme ones.
