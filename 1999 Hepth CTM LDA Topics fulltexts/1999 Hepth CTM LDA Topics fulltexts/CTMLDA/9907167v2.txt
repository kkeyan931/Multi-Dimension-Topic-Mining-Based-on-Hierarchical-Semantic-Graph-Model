abstract

recently d. buchholz and r. verch have proposed a method for im-
plementing in algebraic quantum eld theory ideas from renormaliza-
tion group analysis of short-distance (high energy) behavior by passing
to certain scaling limit theories. buchholz and verch distinguish be-
tween dierent types of theories where the limit is unique, degenerate,
or classical, and the method allows in principle to extract the ultra-
particle content of a given model, i.e. to identify particles (like quarks
and gluons) that are not visible at nite distances due to connement.
it is therefore of great importance for the physical interpretation of
the theory. the method has been illustrated in a simple model in with
some rather surprising results.

this paper will focus on the question how the short distance be-
havior of models dened by euclidean means is reected in the cor-
responding behavior of their minkowski counterparts. more speci-
cally, we shall prove that if a euclidean theory has some short distance
limit, then it is possible to pass from this limit theory to a theory
on minkowski space, which is a short distance limit of the minkowski
space theory corresponding to the original euclidean theory.

1 introduction

in the past three decades several approaches have been developed that
incorporate the physical principles of quantum eld theory (qfth) in
a mathematically rigorous fashion. among these rigorous approaches
the framework of algebraic quantum eld theory is probably the most
highly developed.
its basic objects are algebras of observables, in-
dexed by domains of space-time where the observables can be mea-
sured. hence the interpretation of the basic structure is rather clear-
cut. many deep, model independent results have been obtained within
this framework, which has also proved well adapted to the construction
and analysis of models in two dimensional conformal eld theory.

on the other hand, models of quantum elds based on concrete
lagrangians are usually constructed by means of euclidean functional
integrals [16]. from the constructive point of view these methods have
many advantages, for the basic algebraic structure is commutative and
powerful tools from classical statistical mechanics can be applied. the
passage from such objects in euclidean space to algebraic quantum
eld theory on minkowski space time is mathematically a highly non-
trivial operation, however, and it is by no means clear in general how
properties of the former are reected in latter. hence the physical
interpretation is much less obvious than in algebraic quantum eld
theory. when the euclidean theory has only been proved to exist in
a bounded euclidean domain, as is the case for the four dimensional
yang-mills model constructed by magnen, rivasseau and seneor [19],
the passage itself is an important unsolved problem.

recently d. buchholz and r. verch have proposed a method for im-
plementing in algebraic quantum eld theory ideas from renormaliza-
tion group analysis of short-distance (high energy) behavior by passing
to certain scaling limit theories [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4]. buchholz and verch
distinguish between dierent types of theories where the limit is unique,
degenerate, or classical, and the method allows in principle to extract
the ultraparticle content of a given model, i.e. to identify particles
(like quarks and gluons) that are not visible at nite distances due to
connement. it is therefore of great importance for the physical in-
terpretation of the theory. the method has been illustrated in a simple
model in [5] with some rather surprising results.

this paper will focus on the question how the short distance be-
havior of models dened by euclidean means is reected in the corre-
sponding behavior of their minkowski counterparts. more specically,
we shall prove that if a euclidean theory has some short distance limit,
then it is possible to pass from this limit theory to a theory on mi-
nowski space, which is a short distance limit of the minkowski space
theory corresponding to the original euclidean theory.

the present status of algebraic euclidean eld theory.
the techniques of euclidean eld theory (efth) [16] have proved to
be very powerful for the construction of interacting quantum eld the-
ory models and often superior to the method of canonical quantiza-
tion in minkowski space. for instance, existence of the 4
3 model as
a wightman quantum eld theory has been established by using eu-
clidean methods [11, 25, 20] combined with the osterwalder-schrader
reconstruction theorem [21]. within a hamiltonian framework essen-
tially only the proof of the positivity of the energy has been carried out.
also in cases where a direct minkowski space construction is possible,
as in the p ()2 and yukawa2 models, euclidean techniques may sim-
plify things considerably, e.g. in in the proof of of poincare covariance
or discussions of phase transitions and symmetry breaking. in these
constructions the key objects are usually the euclidean greens func-
tions, or schwinger distributions, sn that are represented as moments
of a measure d on a space of distributions s(rd)

sn(x1,    , xn) = z d() (x1)    (xn).

methods from statistical mechanics like renormalization group analysis
[14] and cluster expansions [3] can be applied in order to perform the
continuum and the innite volume limits of lattice regularized mod-
els. but the construction of schwinger distributions is not enough,
the problem of linking them to physics in minkowski space has to be
addressed.

the osterwalder-schrader reconstruction theorems [21] connect the
schwinger distributions of an euclidean eld theory with the wightman
distributions of a quantum eld theory on minkowski space. power-
ful as these theorems are, there are several reasons why they can not
be considered as the nal answer to the problem of linking euclidean
and minkowski space theories. for one thing, the conditions of the
equivalence theorem (theorem e  r in [21]) are extremely hard to
verify, while the convenient sucient conditions for the passage from
schwinger distributions to wightman distributions (theorem e(or
e) r in [21]) are most probably too restrictive in general. sec-
ondly, and this is a more important point than the rst for the present
discussion, the results in [21] do not allow one to conclude that a lo-
cal net of observable algebras in the sense of algebraic quantum eld
theory can be obtained from the schwinger distributions. in fact, the
question when a wightman quantum eld gives rise to such a net is
quite a delicate one, see [1] for a review. useful sucient conditions are
known, however [16, 10]. in the models with point elds constructed
so far these conditions are fullled, but it appears very unlikely that
they will be so in general.

the third point is that schwinger distributions, which are euclidean

3

expectation values of point elds, may not be adequate in gauge the-
ories and one should rather consider expectation values of extended
objects localized around loops or even strings extending to innity.
an osterwalder-schrader-type reconstruction scheme which can be ap-
plied to correlation functions of loops and strings was established by
e. seiler [24] and j. frohlich, k. osterwalder and e. seiler [13]. lo-
cal commutativity of the reconstructed observables remained an open
problem in this work, however.

a c*-algebraic version of the reconstruction theorems in [21, 10,
16], which to a certain extent generalizes the previous considerations
in [13, 24] and solves the locality problem, has been worked out in
[22]. the starting point of this analysis is a net b of c*-algebras,
indexed by regions in euclidean space, and acted upon by an action 
of the euclidean group by automorphisms of e. the third ingredient is
a continuous euclidean invariant and reexion positive [16] functional
 on b. it is shown in [22] that for a given euclidean eld (b, , )
a haag-kastler net a on minkowski space, a covariant action of the
poincare group by automorphisms  on a as well as a vacuum state 
on a can directly be reconstructed from (b, , ). the main advantage
of the c*-algebraic framework, is that one only deals with bounded
operators from the outset. this is also important for the proof of
locality for the constructed haag-kastler net. finally, we mention that
there are indications that a c*-algebraic point of view also enlarges the
variety of constructible euclidean eld theory models [23].

scaling algebras and renormalization group. a general ap-
proach for the analysis of the high energy properties of a given quantum
eld theory model has been developed by d. buchholz and r. verch
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4]. the starting point of their analysis is a quantum eld
theory formulated within the c*-algberaic approach as it has been in-
troduced by r. haag and d. kastler [17, 18]. we briey recall here
the mathematical description of this framework.

a p

+-covariant haag-kastler net is an inclusion preserving pre-
scription which assigns to each double cone o = v+ + x  v + y a
unital c*-subalgebra a(o)  a of a c*-algebra a. 1 the self-adjoint
elements within a local algebra a(o) correspond to observables which
can be measured within the spacetime region o. the poincare group
p
+ acts covariantly on the net o 7 a(o), i.e. there is a group ho-
momorphism  from the poincare group into the automorphism group
of a, such that ga(o) = a(go) for each poincare transformation
g. the concept of locality is encoded by the property that, if o, o1
are two spacelike separated regions, then the operators in a(o) com-

1here v = {x|x2 > 0, x0 > 0} is the forward (backward) light cone in minkowski

space.

4

mute with those in a(o1), i.e. two measurements which are performed
in spacelike separated regions are commensurable. we write for the
corresponding p

+-covariant haag-kastler net (a, ).

one selection criterion for physical states, which is related to a sta-
bility requirement, is the so called spectrum condition. a state , ehich
is subject to this condition, is called a positive energy state, character-
ized by the property that there exists a unitary strongly continuous
representation u of the poincare group on the gns hilbert space of
, implementing the automorphisms g in the gns representation of
, such that the spectrum of the generator of the translation group
x 7 u (x) is contained in the closed forward light cone v+. a partic-
ular class of positive energy states are the vacuum states, which also
have the property to be poincare invariant,   g = . this reects
the fact that within a vacuum there is no matter conguration which
can distinguish a certain region in spacetime.

a triple (a, , ), where (a, ) is a haag-kastler net and  is a

positive energy state is called a quantum eld.

the concept of scaling algebra allows to express some basic ideas of
renormalization group analysis within the algebraic framework. for a
positive number  > 0 one builds a new haag-kastler net o 7 a(o)
by dening the scaled algebra of a domain o by a(o) := a(o) and
putting (,g) := g1 for a poincare transformation g. thus one
keeps minkowski space xed and one interprets the properties of the
given theory at small scales (high energy behavior) in terms of the
modied theories o 7 a(o).

the scaling algebra a is the c*-algebra which is generated by a
certain class of bounded functions a : r+  a (see [5] and related
work). the functions in a are regarded as orbits under the action of
the renormalization group transformations which identify operators at
scale 1 with operators at scale . this requires a particular scaling
behavior in conguration space, namely an operator a  a is localized
in o if for each   r+ the operator a() is localized in the scaled
region o. on the other hand, a condition for the scaling behavior in
momentum space is needed in order to x plancks constant . formu-
lated in terms of the scaling algebra, the correct scaling in momentum
space can be archieved by requiering that the continuety property

lim
g1

sup
r+

ka()  g1 a()k = 0

is fullled for each a  a. in other words, the group homomorphism
 from the poincare group into the automorphism group of a, which
is given by

(ga)()

:= g1 a()

is strongly continuous.

5

each physical state  (in particular a vacuum state) of the underly-
ing theory o 7 a(o) can be lifted to a physical state  on the scaling
algebra by the prescription

h, ai

:= h, a(1)i .

hence the state  evaluates the renormalization group orbit a at scale
 = 1.

the group of scaling transformations  acts by automorphism on

the scaling algebra in a natural fashion

(a)(1)

:= a(1) ,

leading to a net of states

{ =   |0 < }

which has, according to the weak-compactness of the set of states of a
c*-algebra, weak limit points  for   0 (the symbol  labels such a
limit point). it has been proven in [8, 5] that all weak limit points 
are vacuum states and for each of them one obtains a quantum eld
(a , , ), where the algebra a is dened by

a

:= a/1

 (0)

where  is the gns representation of . the group homomorphism
 is the lifting of  to a, which exists, since the ideal 1
 (0) is
poincare invariant. these quantum elds are called scaling limits of
the quantum eld (a, , ) and they describe the high energy behavior
of the underlying theory. d. buchholz and r. verch distinguish three
cases in order to classify the scaling limits:

(1) all scaling limit theories are equivalent, i.e. the scaling limit is

unique.

(2) all scaling limit theories are just multiples of the identity, i.e.

one obtains a classical scaling limit.

(3) neither case (1) nor case (2) are valid, i.e. the scaling limit is

degenerate.

taking scaling limits and passing form efth to qfth.
for or a given euclidean eld (b, , ) the short-distance behavior can
be obtained by rst passing by means of the construction procedure
[22], which we are going to explain in section 2 in more detail, to the
corresponding quantum eld theory model (a, , ) and in a second
step applying the analysis of d. buchholz and r. verch [8, 5] in order to

get the scaling limit theories (a, , ). we illustrate this procedure
digramatically in the following way:

the two step procedure, described above, is rather cumbersome and
it is advantageous to be able to study the scaling limit theories directly
on the euclidean level. more precisely, one wishes to build from a eu-
clidean eld (b, , ) the euclidean scaling limit theory (b , 
) rst
and then, in a second step, one constructs the corresponding minkowski
quantum eld theory model which we denote by (a, , ), without
underlining the the symbols.

2 from euclidean eld theory to quantum
eld theory

within this section we briey discuss the ideas and strategies which
have been developed in [22]. the starting point in the framework of
algebraic euclidean eld theory is an isotonous net

u 7 b(u )  b

of c*-algebras, indexed by the set k d of bounded convex regions u
in rd, on which the euclidean group e(d) acts covariantly by automor-
phisms, i.e. there exists a group homomorphism  from the euclidean
group e(d) into the automorphism group of b such that

gb(u ) = b(gu )

for each u  k d and for each g  e(d). in order to implement the
concept of locality within the euclidean framework, we assume that
two operators commute if they are localized in disjoint regions, i.e. if
u1  u2 = , then

[b(u1), b(u2)] = {0} .

a further ingredient for building quantum eld theory models from
euclidean data are reexion positive euclidean invariant regular states.
these states fulll the following conditions:

euclidean invariance: for each euclidean transformation h 
e(d):   h = .

reexion positivity: let e  sd1 be a euclidean time direction,
then we denote by b(e) the c*-algebra generated by operators which
are localized in the half space r+e + e, where e is the hyperplane,
orthogonal to e. a state  is reexion positive if the sesquilinear form

b(e)  b(e)  b1  b2 7 h, je(b1)b2i

(1)

is positive semidenite. here je is the antilinear involution

je(b) = e(b)

with e : x 7 2ex + x.

regularity: for each b1, b2, b3  b the map

h 7 h, b1h(b2)b3i

is continuous.

8

remarks.

(1) without loss of generality, we may assume that the gns repre-
sentation  of  is faithful. otherwise, we simply replace the
algebra b by the quotient b/1
 (0). note that the automor-
phism h can be lifted to an automorphism on b/1
 (0) since 
euclidean invariant.

(2) we claim here, that regularity is automatically fullled for  if the

group homomorphism  is strongly continuous, i.e. limg1 kg(b)
bk = 0 for each b  b.

we showed in [22] how to construct from a given euclidean eld
in
a quantum eld theory in a particular vacuum representation.
order to point out the relation between the euclidean eld (b, , )
and the minkowskian world, we briey describe the construction of
a hilbert space h on which the physical observables are represented,
the construction of a unitary strongly continuous representation of the
poincare group on h, as well as the haag-kastler net of local algebras.

step 1: by dividing the null-space of the positive semidenite sesquilin-
ear form, introduced by equation 1, and by taking the closure, we ob-
tain a hilbert space h. the corresponding canonical projection onto
the quotient is denoted by

 : b(e) 7 h

and we write  := [1]. a unitary strongly continuous representation
of the poincare group u on h can be constructed, which works es-
sentially analogous to the procedure which has been presented in [13]
(compare also [24, 22]). the vector  is invariant under the action
of u . moreover, the spectrum of the the generator of the translations
x 7 u (x) is contained in the closed forward light cone v+.

step 2: the construction of a poincare covariant haag-kastler net
of bounded operators on h can be performed analogously as it has been
carried out in [22]. we identify bounded operators on h by making
use of the following proposition:

proposition 2.1 : for each s  r+ and for each b  b(e, s), there
exists a bounded operator s(b)  b(h) with

which is uniquely determined by the relation

ks(b)k  kbk

s(b)[b1] = [bse(b1)]

for each b1  b(e).

9

proof. the result follows by an application of the proof of [16, the-
orem 10.5.5]. (cid:3)

if we assume that  is strongly continuous, we expect, however,
that all operators in b, which are localized in the time-slice e, are
multiples of the identity. but time-slice operators may be found in an
appropriate extension of the euclidean eld (b, , ).

extension of euclidean nets. we call an euclidean eld ( b, , )
an extension of (b, , ) if b(u )  b(u ) holds true for each bounded
and convex set u  rd, and h|b = h, |b = , for each euclidean
transformation h.

indeed, there is a natural extension ( b, , ) of the euclidean eld
(b, , ): let (k, , e) be the gns triple of . we introduce a topology
on b by semi norms

kbk

:= k (b)k

with   k. we denote by b the closure of b within this topology and
b is a w*-algebra, isomorphic to the von neumann algebra  (b).2
obviously, the homomorphism  can be extended to a homomorphism
 form e(d) into the automorphism group of b and  can be extended
to a reexion positive euclidean invariant regular state  on b.

for a subset v of the hyperplane e we introduce the algebra b(v )

of time zero operators which is given by the intersection

b(v )

:= \sr+

b([0, s)e  v ) .

a hilbert space h can be constructed from the extended euclidean
eld ( b, , ) by step 1 and it is isomorphic to h. hence we may
identify both spaces in the subsequent, i.e. h = h. analogously to
the analysis, carried out in [22], we get:

proposition 2.2 : there exists a *-representation  of the time-zero
algebra b(e) on h. which is uniquely determined by the relation

(b)[b1] = [bb1]

for each b1  b(e).

2 for a algebra m  b(h), we write m for the commutatnt of m, i.e. the algebra of

operators in b(h) commuting with those in m.

10

for a double cone o, we dene a(o) to be the c*-algebra of oper-

ators on h which is generated by all operators

[22]:

+-covariant quantum eld.

3 on the short-distance analysis of eld

we briey review the concept of scaling algebras which has been in-
vented by d. buchholz and r. verch [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

taking scaling limits.
elegant manner, we introduce here the notion limit functional.

in order to label the scaling limits, in a

let fb(r+) be c*-algebra of all bounded functions on r+ and
the closed two-sided ideal f0(r+) in fb(r+) which is generated by
functions f  fb(r+) with lim0 f () = 0. then we build the
quotient c*-algebra

c(r+) = fb(r+)/f0(r+) ,

the corona algebra. writing sp[c] for the spectrum of an abelian c*-
algebra c, the corona algebra c(r+) can by interpreted as the algebra
of functions which are supported on sp[c(r+)] = sp[fb(r+)]\sp[f0(r+)].
we claim here that sp[f0(r+)] is not homoeomorphic to r+ since
f0(r+) contains also functions which are discontinuous on r+. the
set of states s[c(r+)] on c(r+) are called limit functionals and can
be identied with the set of states s[fb(r+)] on fb(r+) which an-
nihilate the ideal f0(r+). the reason why the states on c(r+)
are called limit functionals becomes clear by looking at a function
f  fb(r+) for which f0 = lim0 f () exists. namely, for each func-
tional   s[c(r+)] the expectation value h, f i = f0 coincides with
the limit of f for   0 since  vanishes on f  f01  f0(r+). a limit

a measure on the compact hausdor space sp[fb(r+)] and we write

scaling limits for the euclidean elds. the scaling algebras
are given as follows: let fb(r+, b) be the c*-algebra of bounded b-
valued functions on r+ then the prescription which is given according
to

:= h1 b()

for each euclidean transformation h, yields an action  of the euclidean
group by automorphisms on fb(r+, b). in order to select the admis-
sible orbits of renormalization group transformations in fb(r+, b),
we consider the c*-subalgebra b in fb(r+, b) on which  is strongly
continuous. in particular, for each bounded convex set u we denote by
b(u ) the c*-subalgebra in b which is generated by elements b  b
with b()  b(u ). this denition implies that  is covariant, i.e.

in other words, the pair (b, ) is a
euclidean net of c*-algebras.

then we obtain from the reexion positivity of  that

since b()  b(e) is localized in the half space r+e + e for each .

been used by d. buchholz and r. verch. we make some more detailed
comments on this fact in appendix a.

quantum elds, constructed from the euclidean scaling
limits. according to proposition 3.1 the triple (b, ,

clidean eld. we recall here the procedure of step 1 and step 2, given
in the previous section, in order to x our notations.

sentation u of the poincare group on h by [13], with invariant vector
 = [1].

step 2: as already mentioned, the strong continuity of the group
homomorphism  might cause the problem that all operators in b
which are localized in the time-slice e are multiples of the iden-
tity. thus we wish to nd an extension ( b, , 
) of the euclidean
net (b, , 
) such that non trivial time slice operators may be found
in there.

as we are going to show in appendix d (lemma b.1), there indeed
exists an extension ( b, , 
) with the
following property: let j be the ideal which is annihilated by the
. then the algebra b/j is the extension of
gns representation of 
b/j which can be obatained by the completion procedure in step 2
of the previeous section. in particular, the algebra b is independent
of the limit functional .





due to proposition 2.1, for an operators b  b(e, s), localized near

the time-slice e, a bounded operator (s,)(b) on h is given by

(s,)(b) [b1]

:= [b

b1]

se

and by proposition 2.2, for a time slice operator b0  b(e), a
bounded operator  (b0) on h is dened by

 (b0)[b1]

:= [b0b1]

.

thus we can build a haag-kastler net: for a double cone o, we dene
a(o) to be the c*-subalgebra in b(h ) which is generated by all
operators

 [f, b] = z dg f (g) u(g)(b)u (g)

with b  b(v ), f  c 
transformation g in the support of f . the prescription

+), such that gv  o for each poincare

0 (p

o 7 a(o)

is an isotonous net of c*-algebras and by putting (,g) := ad(u(g)),
for each g  p
+, and  := h , ()i we obtain the quantum eld
(a, , ).

scaling limits for the constructed haag-kastler net. the
scaling algebra a can be expressed in terms of the time-zero algebras
b(v ) of the extended net, introduced in previous paragraph. each
operator b can be identied with a map b : r+  b(e) (lemma
b.2) which assigns to each scaling parameter a time slice operator in
b(e). the scaling algebra a is generated by all functions

[f, b] :  7 [f, b]() := z dg f (g) u(g)(b())u(g)

0 (p

where f  c 
+) is a smooth function on the poincare group with
compact support and b  b(e) is a time slice operator. here, u is
the scaled representation of the poincare group on h, which is dened
according to u(g) := u (  g  1) for each poincare transformation
g.

as also described in the introduction, a group homomorphism 
from the poincare group into the automorphism group of the scaling
algebra a, acting covariantly on the net o 7 a(o), is simply dened
according to

(ga)()

:= g1 a()

for each a  a.

of course, we have to ensure that the algebra a contains renormal-
ization group orbits with the correct scaling property in conguration
space as well as in momentum space:

proposition 3.2 : the group homomorphism  is strongly continu-
ous on a:

lim
g1

ka  gak = 0

for each a  a.

proof. we rst check the continuety for all generators [f, b], where
f  c 
+) is a smooth function on the poincare group with compact

0 (p

15

support and b  b(e) is a time slice operator:

lim
g1

k[f, b]  g[f, b]k

= lim
g1

= lim
g1

k[f, b]  [f  g1, b]k

k[f  f  g1, b]k

 sup
r+

kb()k lim

g1z dg |f (g)  f (g1g)|

= 0 .

now let a1, a2 be two operators with limg1 kajgaj k = 0 for j = 1, 2
then we obtain

lim
g1

ka1a2  g(a1a2)k

 ka1k lim
g1

ka2  g(a2)k + ka2k lim
g1

ka1  g(a1)k

= 0

which implies that strong continuety is valid for all nite linear combi-
nations of products of generators. for each operator a  a and for each
 > 0 we can nd a nite linear combination of products of generators
a such that ka  ak < /2. thus we get

lim
g1

ka  g(a)k  2ka  ak + lim
g1

ka  g(a)k

< 

and hence limg1 ka  g(a)k = 0 for all a  a. (cid:3)

for a given limit functional  we build the scaling limit (a, ,  )
of the quantum eld (a, , ) in the following manner: a vacuum state
 is given according to the prescription

h, ai

:= z d() h, a()i

for each a  a. let j be the two sided ideal in a which is annihilated
by the gns representation of . we build the quotient c*-algebra

a

:= a/j

16

and we denote by q the corresponding canonical projection onto the
quotient. the group homomorphism  can be lifted to a group homo-
morphism  from the poincare group into the automorphism group
of a by

(,g)  q = q  g

for each poincare trnsformation g. as a consequence the assignment

o 7 a(o)

:= q(a(o))

together with the group homomorphism  is a poincare covariant
haag-kastler net.

the main result. we are now prepared to show that the subse-
quent two step procedures applied to a given euclidean eld (b, , ),
lead to equivalent results.

(1) for a given limit functional   s[c(r+)] we rst build the
) and then the corresponding quantum

euclidean eld (b, , 
eld theory model (a, , ).



(2) on the other hand, we rst build the quantum eld theory model
(a, , ) and then we construct the scaling limit (a,  , ) with
respect to a limit point   s[c(r+)].

theorem 3.3 : for each limit functional   s[c(r+)], the quantum
elds (a, , ) and (a, , ) are equivalent.

the complete proof of theorem 3.3 is given in the appendix d and

we only describe the main idea of it here.

sketch of the proof:
in the rst step, a poincare covariant rep-
resentation  of the scaling algebra a on a hilbert space h is con-
structed and it can be shown that  is equivalent to the gns repre-
sentation of the scaling limit state . in the second step, an isometry
u from the hilbert space h to h is constructed such that

u [f, b]u

 = ([f, b])

(3)

holds true for each smooth function with compact support f on the
poincare group and for each time zero operator b in the extended
scaling algebra b(e). note, that the operator [f, b] is contained in
the c*-algebra a, corresponding to procedure (1), whereas ([f, b])
can be identied with an operator in the c*-algebra a corresponding
to procedure (2). as a consequence the map

 : a 7 u au


17

yields an isomorphism of the algebras a and a which respects the
net structure,  (a(o)) = a(o) for each double cone o. moreover,
 intertwines the automorphisms  and , i.e.    =   , and
maps the vacuum state  to , i.e.    = .

the crucial point in order to prove equation (3) is to establish
the fact that u intertwines the corresponding representations of the
poincare group. more precisely, the hilbert space h (respectively
h), carry a strongly continuous unitary representation u (respec-
tively u ) of the poincare group and one has to show that

uu(g)u

 = u  (g)

holds true for each poincare transformation g. this intertwiner prop-
erty can be veried as follows: let b be the generator of a poincare
transformation. then there is a dense subspace d  h such that for
each pair 1, 2 the functions

f : z 7 h1, u (exp(zb))2i

f : z 7 hu

 1, u(exp(zb))u

2i

are holomorphic within a strip r + ii, where i is some connected open
subset in r. within the pure imaginary points, both functions can be
expressed explicitly in terms of euclidean correlation functions within
the scaling limit state 

and one nds that



f (i ) = f (i )

is valid for each   i. hence one concludes f = f and the interwiner
property follows since d is dense in h.

4 concluding remarks

we have proven that the quantum eld theories, which can be recon-
structed from euclidean scaling limit theories, are scaling limit theories
of the quantum eld theory which can be reconstructed from the un-
derlying euclidean eld theory.

this fact leads us into a comfortable position which can be also
motivated by the consideration of euclidean eld theories with cutos.
usually, to a regularized euclidean model the construction scheme [22]
cannot even by applied. on the other hand, the euclidean counterpart
of the analysis by d. buchholz and r. verch [8, 5] can be formulated
for euclidean eld theory models in the c*-setting as we have discussed
during this paper. the procedure, given in section 3, is quite general
and it still makes sense also for regularized euclidean models with a
infra-red and an ultra-violet cuto.

18

we expect that scaling limit theories of euclidean eld theories
within a nite volume are essentially independent of the volume cut-
o. we propose to regard a nite volume euclidean eld theory in d
dimensions as a eld theory on the scaled d-sphere rsd  rd+1, where
r is the volume cuto. the corresponding euclidean net b carries a
covariant action of the d + 1-dimensional rotation group o(d + 1) and
the functional  is invariant under this action. for a point x0  rsd,
the stabilizer subgroup of x0 in o(d + 1) is isomorphic to o(d).
if
the scaling limit procedure is performed at x0, the invariance under
the stabilizer subgroup should remain as a o(d) invariance within the
scaling limit. the translation invariance should then enter from the
fact that  is invariant under the full group o(d + 1). note, that r is
replaced by r = 1r for the scaled theory. hence one expects that
the scaling limit theories are models within an innite volume.

keeping in mind that the minkowskian analogue of the euclidean
d-sphere rsd  rd+1 is the de sitter space, it should be possible, by
exploring the analytic structure of de sitter space, to construct from
a given euclidean eld theory (b, , ) on the sphere rsd a quantum
eld theory (a, , ) in de sitter space. according to the consider-
ations of h. j. borchers and d. buchholz [2] we conjecture that the
reconstructed state  fullls the so called geodesic kms condition, i.e.
for any geodesic observer the state  looks like an equilibrium state.

a remarks on limit functionals

as a tool for taking scaling limits we have used the limit functional
on the corona algbera c(r+) = fb(r+)/f0(r+). more general, we
replace r+ by any partially ordered directed set , and we consider the
c*-algebra fb() of all bounded functions on  and the closed two-
sided ideal f0() in fb() which is generated by functions f  fb()
with lim f () = 0. the states   s[c()] on the quotient c*-
algebra

c() = fb()/f0()

are called the limit functionals with respect to .

let v be a locally convex linear space whose topology is induced
by a family of semi norms p  p. a function w :   v  from the
partially ordered set  to the dual space v  is called bounded if there
exists a semi norm p  p and a constant k > 0 such that

|hw(), vi|  k p(v)

sup


holds true for each v  v . for each limit functional   s[c()] we
obtain a linear functional w on v by the prescription

hw, vi

:= z d() hw(), vi .

the functional w is well dened since for each v  v the function
[ 7 hw(), vi] is contained in fb(). in particular, w fullls for
each v  v the estimate

|hw, vi|  k p(v)

and w is a continuous functional on v .

as a special case, let v be a banach space with norm k  k and let
k  k be the dual norm on v . for each bounded function w :   v ,
we create new elements in v  in two dierent ways:

(1) according to the banach-alaoglu theorem, the set {w(),   }
is precompact and there exists a partially ordered directed set j
and a subnet  : j   such that

hw, vi

:= lim
jj

hw((j)), vi

for each v  v .

(2) we also can choose a limit functional   s[c()] and build the

linear functional w  v  as described above.

20

choosing the state w, via a subnet  : j  , is essentially the

same as choosing a limit functional   s[c()]. more precisely:

proposition a.1 : for each subnet  : j   for which the weak*-
limit w = w  limjj w((j)) exists in v , there exists a limit func-
tional   s[c()] such that

w = w

.

proof. the subnet  : j   induces a *-homomorphism  : fb() 
fb(j) by f = f  . one observes that for each state   s[c(j)]
on the corona algebra of j, the state  =    yields a state on c().
namely, let f  f0() then lim f () = 0 and thus limjj f ((j)) =
0 for each subnet  : j  . hence f0()  f0(j) and the state
 =    annihilates f0() which implies   s[c()]. since for each
v  v the function [j 7 hw((j))  w, vi] is contained in f0(j) we
conclude

hw, vi = z d(j) hw((j)), vi

= z d(  )() hw(), vi

= hw, vi

which implies the proposition. (cid:3)

b notes on scaling limits of euclidean elds

in order to construct from the euclidean data (b, , 
) a quantum
eld theory model, we discuss now an appropriate extension of the
scaling algebra b.



let (k, , e) be the gns triple of . according to the euclidean
invariance of , there exists a strongly continuous representation v of
the euclidean group on k which is uniquely determined by

v (h) (b)e =  (hb)e

for each b  b and for each euclidean transformation h. let ko be the
linear space, spanned by bounded functions  : r+  k of the form





= z dh f (h) v(h)0



where 0 : r+  k is any bounded function and v(h) = v (h1)
is the scaled representation. we introduce a locally convex topology

21

on ko which is induced by semi norms k  k, where  is a state on
fb(r+):

kk2


:= z d() h

, 





i .

the closure of ko with respect to this topology is denoted by k. the
prescription

[ (b)]

:=  (b())



yields a faithful representation of the scaling algebra on k by bounded
operators  (b).

we also introduce semi norms on b, namely for a state  on fb(r+)

and for a vector  we introduce the semi norm k  k(,) by

kbk(,) = k (b)k

and the closure of b within this topology is denoted by b. note that
the group homomorphism  can be extended to a group homomor-
phism  form the euclidean group into the automorphism group of
b.

for each state  on fb(r+) there is a hilbert space k and a linear

map p : k  k which is uniquely determined by

hp[

1

], p[

]i = z d() h

2

, 

2,

i .

1,

we also use, which is sometimes convenient, the suggestive notation

p[] = z 

d() 

.



lemma b.1 : for each state  on fb(r+) the following statements
are valid:

(1) there exists a strongly continuous unitary representation v  on

k of the euclidean group.

(2) there exists a *-representation   on k of the extended scaling

algebra b and a vector e  k such that

h



, bi = he,  (b)e i

is valid for each b  b.

(3) for each h  e(d) and for each b  b the identity

 (

h

b) = v (h) (b)v (h)

holds true.

22

proof. we dene the representation v  of the euclidean group by

v (h)p[] = z 

d() v(h) 



for each h  e(d) and for each   k. for each b  b and for each
  k the map b 7  (b) is continuous as a linear function form b
to k since for each  we have

k (b)k = kbk(,)

and  can uniquely be extended to representation  of b on k. now
we dene the representation   by

 (b)p[]

:= p[ (b)]

for each b  b and for each   k.

(1) we rst show that v  is indeed a strongly continuous represen-

tation of the euclidean group. the vectors of 

of the form







= z 

d() z dh f (h) v(h)0



,

where 0 : r+  k is any bounded function, span a dense
subspace in k. we compute

v (h)



= z 
= z 

which yields

d() z dh f (h) v(hh)0
d() z dh f (h1h) v(h)0





kv (h)



 

k  z dh |f (h1h)  f (h)| sup

r+



k0


k

and we conclude that

lim
h1

kv (h)

 





k = 0

holds true for all 
(1) follows.



in a dense subspace of k and the statement

(2) the hilbert space k contains a distinguished vector e

e = z 

d() e

23

which is invariant under the representation v . this vector yields
a state 

on the extended scaling algebra b by



h



, bi

:= he,  (b)ei

for b  b. according to the construction of k we easily observe
that 

is an extension of 

:





he,  (b)e i = z d() he,  (b())ei

= z d() h, b()i

= h

, bi



for each b  b which implies (2).

(3) statement (3) can easily be vered, from the denition of the

representations   and v .

(cid:3)

the extended state 

is euclidean invariant, reexion positive, and
regular. in particular, the regularity follows from the fact that v  is a
strongly continuous representation of the euclidean group. hence the
triple ( b, , 

) is a euclidean eld which extends (b, , 

).







lemma b.2 : the time zero algebra b(e) can be identied with the
c*-algebra generated by bounded functions b :  7 b()  b(v )
mapping each   r+ into the algebra b(v ) for some convex and
bounded region v  e.

proof. for each   r+ the representation   is a representation of
b on k since we have for each b  b

 (b)p[] =  (b())

.



we have assumed that  is a faithful representation and we may dene
for each time zero operator b  b(v ), v  e, the operator

b()

:=  1( (b))

which is contained in b. according to the localizing property of b we
conclude

b()  \sr+

b([0, s)e  v ) = b(v ) .

24

since the w*-algebra b is closed in the strong operator topology, for
a given function b :  7 b()  b(v ) there is a net of operators
(bj)jj in b, converging in b, such that

lim
jj

kbj  bk(,) = lim
jj

k (bj ()  b())

k = 0



for each   k, pointwise in   r+. (cid:3)

c notes on scaling limits of quantum elds
constructed form euclidean data

let ho be the linear space, spanned by bounded functions  : r+  h
of the form





= z dg f (g) u(g)0



where 0 : r+  h is any bounded function and u(g) = u (g1)
is the scaled representation. we introduce a locally convex topology
on ho which is induced by semi norms k  k, where  is a state on
fb(r+):

kk2


:= z d() h

, 





i .

the closure of ho with respect to this topology is denoted by h. the
prescription

[(a)]

:= a()



yields a faithful representation  of the scaling algebra a on h by
bounded operators.

as in the euclidean case, for each state  on fb(r+) there is a
hilbert space h and a linear map q : h  h which is uniquely
determined by

hq[

1

], q[

]i = z d() h

2

, 

i

2,

1,

and we also write

q[] = z 

d() 

.



analogously to lemma b.1 in the euclidean case, we obtain for
each state  on fb(r+) a strongly continuous representation u  of the

25

poincare group as well as a representation  of the scaling algebra a
on h such that

(ga) = u (g)(a)u (g)

where  and u  are given by

(a)q[] = z 
u (g)q[] = z 

d() a()



d() u(g) 

.



we are now prepared to formulate a lemma which turns out to
be very useful for our subsequent analysis and which relates the rep-
resentation  to the gns triple (h ,  ,  ) of the scaling limit
:

lemma c.1 : for each limit functional  there exists an isometry

v : h  h

which intertwines the gns representation  of the scaling limit 
and the representation of  on the scaling algebra:

v  (a) = (a)v

for each a  a.

proof. an isometry

v : h  h

is given by the prescription

v [ (a) ] = (a)

where  is the equivalence class in h of the function  :  7  =
[1]. indeed we have

kv [ (a) ]k2 = h(a),  (a)i

= z d() h, a()a()i
= h , a()a()i

and v is a well dened isometry which intertwines the representations
 and  . (cid:3)

26

d the proof of theorem 3.3

construction of an intertwining isometry. we have shown
in the previous paragraph that the hilbert space h carries a faith-
ful representation of the scaling algebra a. on the other hand, the
hilbert space h carries a faithful representation of the algebra a
which is constructed from the scaling limit (b, , 
) of the euclidean
eld (b, , ). within this paragraph we construct an isometry from
h to h. it turns out that this particular isometry induces an algebra
isomorphism between a and a.



for each s  r+ and for each b  b(s, e) and for each time zero
operator b0  b(e) we dene bounded operators (s,)(b) and (b0)
on h according to

(s,)(b)q [] = z 
(b0)q [] = z 

d() s(b())



d() (b0())



for each   h.

lemma d.1 : there exists an isometry

u : h  h

such that for each s  r+ and for each b  b(s, e) and for each time
zero operator b0  b(e) the identities

u(s,)(b) = (s,)(b)u

u (b0) = (b0)u

are valid.

proof. we dene the operator u by according to

u [b]

:= [b]

where [b]  h is dened by

[b]()

:= [b()]

27

and [b] is the corresponding equivalence class in h . indeed, u is
a well dened isometry, since we have

ku[b]k2

:= h[b], [b]i

= z d() h, je(b())b()i

= h



, je(b)bi

= k[b]k2 .

we compute for each s  r+, for each b  b(s, e) and for each b1 
b(e):

u (s,)(b)[b1] = u [b

b1]

se

= [b

b1]

se

= (s,)(b)[b1]

= (s,)(b)u[b1]

.

the identity

u (b0) = (b0)u

follows from a similar computation which implies the lemma. (cid:3)

lemma d.2 : the isometry u intertwines the representations u
and u : for each poincare transformation g the identity

uu(g) = u (g)u

holds true.

proof. let e1 be a euclidean direction, perpendicular to e. and let
(e,e1) be the one-parameter group of automorphisms which are given
by the rotations in the e, e1 plane. let (e, r), r > 0, be the open cone
which is invariant under the stabilizer subgroup of e and which has
opening angle /2  r with r  (0, /2).

28

according to [13], for each  , with | |  r, there exist self adjoint

operators

v(e,e1)( ) : [b((e, r))]  h

v(e,e1 ,)( ) : [b((e, r))]  h

which are given by

v(e,e1)( )[b]

:= [(e,e1, )b]

v(e,e1 ,)( ) [b]

:= [

b]

.

(e,e1 , )

we identify the hyperplane e with a space like hyperplane in minkowski
space and e with the corresponding timelike direction. let b(e,e1) and
b(e,e1,) be the (anti-selfadjoint) generators of the lorentz boosts in
e, e1 direction within the representation u and u respectively. then
the identities

v(e,e1)( ) = exp(i b(e,e1))

v(e,e1,)( ) = exp(i b(e,e1 ,))

are valid. for operators b0  b(e) and b1  b((e, r)), we introduce
complex functions by

f [e,e1|b0,b1]



(z)

:= h[b0()], exp(zb(e,e1))[b1()]i

f [e,e1|b0,b1]



(z)

:= h[b0], exp(zb(e,e1,))[b1]i .

according to the analysis, carried out in [13, 22], the functions f [e,e1|b0,b1]
 > 0, and f [e,e1|b0,b1]

are holomorphic in the open strip r + i(r, r).
furthermore, let he and he, be the positive generators (hamilton
operators) of the semi group of contractions ve and v(e,) respectively,
given by





,

ve( )[b]

:= [ eb]

v(e,)( ) [b]

:= [

b]

 e

for each  > 0 and for each b  b(e) and for each b  b(e). for
b0, b1  b(e) we introduce again complex functions

f [e|b0,b1]



(z)

:= h[b0()], exp(zhe)[b1()]i

f [e|b0,b1]


(z)

:= h[b0], exp(zh(e,))[b1]i .

29

which are holomorphic in the upper half plane r + ir+.

the lemma follows mainly from the subsequent statements, which

are proven in the next section appendix e:

sublemma d.3 : for each limit functional   s[c(r+)], for each
b0  b(e), and for each b1  b((e, r)):

(1) the prescription

f [e,e1|b0,b1]



: z

7 z d() f [e,e1|b0,b1]



(z)

yields a well dened function which is holomorphic in the strip
r + i(r, r).

(2) the prescription

f [e|b0,b1]



: z

7 z d() f [e|b0,b1]



(z)

yields a well dened function which is holomorphic in the upper
half plane r + ir+.

sublemma d.4 : for each limit functional   s[c(r+)], for each
b0  b(e), and for each b1  b((e, r)) the identities

f [e,e1|b0,b1]



= f [e,e1|b0,b1]



f [e|b0,b1]



= f [e|b0,b1]



holds true.

let e1  e and let g be the lorentz transformation such that

u (g) = exp(tb(e,e1)) .

according to sublemma d.4 we compute

h[b0], u

u (g)[b1]i = f [e,e1|b0,b1]



(t)

= f [e,e1|b0,b1]



(t)

= h[b0], u(g)[b1]i

and since [b(e)] is dense in h , we conclude that

u (g)[b1] = uu(g)[b1]

30

which implies

uu(g) = u (g)u

for each lorentz boost g. analogously we conclude for the time like
translations in e direction

h[b0], u

u (te)[b1]i = f [e|b0,b1]



(t)

= f [e|b0,b1]



(t)

= h[b0], u(te)[b1]i

and thus

for each t  r.

uu(te) = u (te)u

now, let g be an element of the stabilizer subgroup of the hyper-

plane e, then we compute for each b  b(e):

uu(g)[b] = u[

b]

g

=  [

b]

g

= u (g) [b]

.

therefore the identity

uu(g) = u (g)u

is valid for each poncare transformation g which completes the proof.
(cid:3)

proof of theorem 3.3. by lemma c.1 the quantum eld (a, , )
may be identied with the scaling algebra (a, ) in the vacuum repre-
sentation .

recall, that the scaling algebra a can be introduced in terms of the
time-zero algebras b(v ), where v is a bounded and convex region in
the time slice e. for a double cone o, the local scaling algebra a(o)
is generated by all functions

[f, b] :  7 z dg f (g) u(g)(b())u(g)

31

0 (p

where f  c 
+) is a smooth function on the poincare group with
compact support such that gv  o for each g in the support of f and
b  b(v ). applying the representation  to [f, b] yields

 [f, b]

:= ([f, b]) = z dg f (g) u (g)(b)u  (g) .

on the other hand, for a double cone o, the local algebra a(o)
of the quantum eld (a, , ) which can be constructed from the
euclidean eld (b, , 

), is generated by operators of the form



 [f, b] = z dg f (g) u(g)(b)u (g)

with a time-zero operator b  b(v ) and a smooth function f 
0 (p
c 

+), such that gv  o for each g in the support of f .

according to the intertwining properties of the isometry u we

conclude form lemma d.1 and from lemma d.2 that the identity

u(cid:20)z dg f (g) u(g)(s,)(b)u (g)(cid:21)u
= z dg f (g) uu(g)(s,)(b)u (g)u
= z dg f (g) u (g)(s,)(b)u (g)





is valid for each s  r+. this implies

u[f, b]u

 =  [f, b]

for each smooth function f  c 
b  b(e). therefore, we get

0 (p

+) and for each time-zero operator

u a(o)u


:= (a(o)) = a(o)

and the map

 : a  a

; a 7 u au


yields an isomorphism of the quantum elds (a, , ) and (a, , )
since

is valid according to lemma d.2 and

   =   

 =   

holds true, which is a consequence of the fact that u = , where
 is the equivalence class in h of the constant function  7 . (cid:3)

e remarks on holomorphic functions

the statements of sublemma d.3 and sublemma d.4 can directly be
obtained form some general statement on holomorphic functions, which
we discuss in the subsequent.

lemma e.1 : let i  r be an open connected subset and let f 
o(r + ii),   r+, be a family of functions which are holomorphic in
r + ii. if there exists a constant k > 0 such that the bound

|f(z)|  k

holds true for each   r+ and for each z  r + ii, then for each
limit functional   s[c(r+)] there exists a function f  o(r + ii),
holomorphic in r+ii, which is uniquely determined by the prescription

f(z) = z d() f(z) .

proof. the lemma is nothing else but montels theorem expressed in
terms of limit functionals. according to our assumption the family of
holomorphic functions f  o(r + ii),   r+, is uniformly bounded
by a constant k, i.e.

|f(z)|  k

for each   r+ and for each z  r + ii. let r > 0 and let dr(z)
be the closed disc in c with radius r and center z. for z  r + ii we
choose r > 0 with dr(z)  r + ii. for z1, z2  dr(z) we immediately
get the estimate

|f(z1)  f(z2)| = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(z) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

uniformly in . this implies, since  is a positive functional,

z z2

z1

dzf 

 |z1  z2|4r1k

|f(z1)  f(z2)|  |z1  z2|4r1k

for each z1, z2  dr(z). now, the function

f : z

7 z d() f(z)

is integrable with respect to the natural measure on the circle dr(z)
since it is continuous in r + ii (in particular uniformly continuous in
dr(z) for each z  r + ii). on the other hand, the function

fdr (z) :  7 zdr(z)

dz f(z)

33

is uniformly bounded in , i.e. fdr (z) is contained in fb(r+), and
hence fdr (z) is measurable with respect to . thus fubinis theorem
can be applied which states that the integration over dr(z) and the
integration with respect to the measure  can be exchanged. this gives

zdr (z)

dz f(z) = zdr (z)

dzz d() f(z)

= z d() zdr (z)

dz f(z)

= 0

which implies that f is holomorphic in z. (cid:3)

proof of sublemma d.3.
that the functions

in order to prove sublemma d.3 we show

f [e,e1|b0,b1]



(z) = h[b0()], exp(zb(e,e1))[b1()]i

f [e|b0,b1]


(z) = h[b0], exp(zhe)[b1]i

are uniformly bounded. since the operators exp(zb(e,e1)) and exp(zhe)
are unitary for real z and since the norm of the vector [b]  h,
b  b(e), is bounded by the operator norm kbk we conclude the esti-
mate

|f [e,e1|b0,b1]



(z)|  kb0k kb1k

|f [e|b0,b1]



(z)|  kb0k kb1k

for each z in the corresponding region of holomorphy and for each
  r+. thus lemma e.1 can be applied, which proves sublemma
d.3. (cid:3)

a further well known fact concerning holomorphic function is the

following:

lemma e.2 : f, f  o(r + ii), be two functions which are holomor-
phic in r + ii, where i is connected. if f and f coincide within the
imaginary points ii, then f = f .

proof of sublemma d.4. for each b1  b((e, r)), the functions
f [e,e1|b0,b1]
are holomorphic in the open strip r +

and f [e,e1|b0,b1]





34

i(r, r) and one easily computes for each   (r, r)

f [e,e1|b0,b1]



(i ) = z d() h[b0()], exp(i b(e,e1))[b1()]i

= z d() h[b0()], [
= z d() h, je(b0())

b1()]i

(e,e1, )

b1()]i

(e,e1, )

= h, je(b0)

b1i

(e,e1, )

= h[b0], exp(i b(e,e1 ,))[b1]i]i

= f [e,e1|b0,b1]



(i )

which implies that f [e,e1|b0,b1]
nary points and by lemma e.2 it follows that f [e,e1|b0,b1]
analogously one proves that f [e|b0,b1]

coincide in the imagi-
= f [e,e1|b0,b1]
holds true also. (cid:3)

and f [e,e1|b0,b1]

= f [e|b0,b1]
