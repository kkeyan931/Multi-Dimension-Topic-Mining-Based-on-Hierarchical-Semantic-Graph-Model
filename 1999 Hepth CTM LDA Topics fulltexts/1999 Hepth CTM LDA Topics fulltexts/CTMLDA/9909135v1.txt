abstract

we introduce a new class of gauge eld theories in any complex dimension, based
on algebra-valued (p, q)-forms on complex n-manifolds. these theories are holomor-
phic analogs of the well-known chern-simons and bf topological theories dened on
real manifolds. we introduce actions for dierent special holomorphic bf theories on
complex, kahler and calabi-yau manifolds and describe a procedure for constructing
solutions to their equations of motion. candidate observables, topological invariants
and relations to integrable models are briey discussed.

introduction

topological eld theories [1, 2] were intensively studied, developed and generalized over the last
ten years (see e.g. [3, 4] and references therein). among these theories some of the most interesting
are non-abelian chern-simons gauge theories [2]. the chern-simons (cs) action functional is

scs = zx

tr (ada +

2
3

a  a  a),

(1.1)

where x is an oriented smooth 3-manifold, a is a connection 1-form on a principal g-bundle p
over x, and g is a lie group. the euler-lagrange equations for the action (1.1) are

fa = 0,

(1.2)

where fa = da + a  a is the curvature of a connection a. thus, non-abelian cs theories give
a eld-theoretic description of at connections on g-bundles over 3-dimensional manifolds x, and
expectation values of quantum observables for these theories are topological invariants of x [2, 3, 4].

other interesting topological eld theories associated with at connections are so-called bf
theories [5, 6] generalizing abelian models introduced in [7]. these theories can also be considered
as a generalization of chern-simons theories to arbitrary dimensions. the classical action for a
non-abelian bf theory has the following form:

sbf = zx

tr (b  fa),

(1.3)

where x is an oriented smooth n-manifold, fa is the curvature of a connection 1-form a on a
principal g-bundle p over x, and b is an (n  2)-form with values in the adjoint bundle adp =
p g g. we consider a semisimple lie group g and denote by g its lie algebra. the variation of the
action (1.3) w.r.t. b gives eqs.(1.2), and the variation of the action w.r.t. a gives the equations

dab = 0,

(1.4)

where da = d + ada is the covariant dierential on p . thus, bf theories describe at connections
a on bundles p over n-manifolds x and adp -valued da-closed (n  2)-forms b.

an interesting class of (topological) gauge models was introduced by considering the classical
limit of the string eld theory for open n = 2 topological strings on a calabi-yau 3-fold [8, 9]. the
corresponding action [8] is given by

shcsw = zz

  tr (a0,1 a0,1 +

2
3

a0,1  a0,1  a0,1),

(1.5a)

where  is a nowhere vanishing holomorphic (3, 0)-form on a calabi-yau 3-fold z, and a0,1 is the
(0, 1)-component of a connection 1-form a on a principal g-bundle p over z. the eld equations
following from the chern-simons-witten (csw) action (1.5a) are

f 0,2
a = a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 = 0,

(1.5b)

where  is the (0, 1)-part of the exterior derivative d =  + , and f 0,2
a is the (0, 2)-part of the
curvature fa of a g-bundle p with a complex structure group g. recently holomorphic csw

2

theories (1.5) were discussed [10, 11] in the frames of the program on extending the results of
casson, floer and jones to calabi-yau (cy) threefolds.

our discussion can be summarized in the following diagram:

cs theories on
real 3-manifolds





(1.6)

holomorphic csw theories
on calabi-yau 3-manifolds

the arrows mean that one theory is a generalization of another one. notice that holomorphic
csw theories (1.5) are dened only in three complex dimensions by analogy with the fact that cs
theories (1.1) with the action linear in derivatives are dened only in three real dimensions. at the
same time, it is desirable to have a eld theory description of at (0, 1)-connections a0,1 (holomor-
phic structures) in arbitrary dimensions. the purpose of our paper is to introduce holomorphic
bf theories generalizing both topological bf theories (1.3) and holomorphic csw theories (1.5)
to complex n-manifolds and describing holomorphic structures on bundles in any complex dimen-
sion. we also introduce three special holomorphic bf theories and describe, in particular, stable
holomorphic bundles. so, our goal in this paper is to extend the diagram (1.6) to the diagram

which includes holomorphic analogs not only of chern-simons but also of bf theories.

the plan of this paper is as follows. in sect.2 we introduce holomorphic bf theories, discuss
their gauge symmetries and moduli spaces. in sect.3 we describe a procedure of nding solutions
to holomorphic bf theories and argue that these models are completely solvable. in sect.4 three
special holomorphic bf theories on kahler, calabi-yau and bered complex manifolds are intro-
duced. in particular, we introduce an action describing hermitian-yang-mills connections on stable
holomorphic bundles and discuss relations between special holomorphic bf theories and integrable
models in real dimensions d  4. in sect.5 observables for proposed models and their relations to
topological invariants are briey discussed. in sect.6 we list some open problems.

2 holomorphic bf theories

2.1 non-abelian models

let z be a complex n-manifold, g a (complex) semisimple lie group, g its lie algebra, p a principal
g-bundle over z and a0,1 a (0, 1)-component of a connection 1-form a on p . components a0,1
of connections a will be called (0, 1)-connections. the curvature fa of a connection a splits into
components,

fa = f 2,0

a + f 1,1

a + f 0,2
a ,

and the (0, 2)-component of the curvature tensor is

f 0,2
a = a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1,

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

where  is the (0, 1)-part of the exterior derivative d =  + . we also split da = d + a = a + a.
let us consider the bundle of groups intp = p gg (g acts on itself by internal automorphisms:
h 7 ghg1, h, g  g) associated with p . we dene the innite-dimensional group of gauge
transformations as the group g = (z, intp ) of global smooth sections of the bundle intp . we
also consider the adjoint bundle adp = p g g of lie algebras and denote by

p,q(z, adp )

(2.2a)

the space of smooth (p, q)-forms on z with values in the bundle adp , p, q, ... = 1, ..., n = dimcz.

for simplicity we shall consider bundles p that are equivalent to the trivial one as smooth
bundles (i.e. topologically trivial), p  z  g. therefore, we have intp  z  g, adp  z  g,
and adp -valued (p, q)-forms may be considered as g-valued (p, q)-forms on z. the space of such
forms we shall denote by

p,q(z, g).

(2.2b)

generalization to the case of topologically nontrivial bundles is straightforward and not dicult.
a of the curvature tensor of a connection 1-form on p

let us consider the (0, 2)-component f 0,2

and a g-valued (n, n  2)-form b on z. we introduce the action

shbf = zz

tr (b  f 0,2

a ),

(2.3)

and models with such actions will be called holomorphic bf theories. the eld equations obtained
from the action (2.3) are

a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 = 0,

b + a0,1  b  b  a0,1 = 0.

(2.4a)

(2.4b)

solutions a0,1 of eqs.(2.4a) will be called at (0, 1)-connections on p . notice that eqs.(2.4a)
coincide with the compatibility conditions 2
a = 0 of eqs.(2.4b). so, holomorphic bf theories
describe at (0, 1)-connections on p which correspond to holomorphic structures on the bundle
p  z.

by expanding a0,1 and b in generators {j i} of the group g, one can rewrite eqs.(2.4) in the

form

ai +

1
2

jkaj  ak = 0,
f i

4

(2.5a)

where a0,1 = aiji, b = biji, and f i
notice that eqs.(2.5b) can be rewritten in the form

jk are structure constants of the group g, i, j, ... = 1, ..., dimcg.

bi + f i

jkaj  bk = 0,

(2.5b)

ab = 0,

where a =  + ada0,1.

the gauge group g acts on a (0, 1)-connection a0,1 on p and on a eld b  n,n2(z, g) by

the formulas

a0,1 7 adg1a0,1 = g1a0,1g + g1 g,

b 7 adg1b = g1bg,

(2.6a)

(2.6b)

where g  g. the action (2.3) is invariant under the transformations (2.6) and under the following
cohomological symmetry transformation:

b 7 b + a,

(2.7)

where   n,n3(z, g). by virtue of this invariance, a is a trivial (pure gauge) solution of
eqs.(2.4b) for any   n,n3(z, g), and solutions b and b + a of eqs.(2.4b) are considered as
equivalent.

we denote by n the space of solutions to eqs.(2.4a) and by m the set of orbits of the gauge

group g in the set n ,

let  be a projection

m = n /g.

 : n  m.

(2.8a)

(2.8b)

by denition, n is the space of at (0, 1)-connections (holomorphic structures) on the bundle p ,
and m is the moduli space of at (0, 1)-connections. put another way, the moduli space m of
holomorphic structures on p is the space of gauge inequivalent solutions to eqs.(2.4a).

equations (2.4b) are linear in b. for any xed at (0, 1)-connection a0,1 the space ba of

nontrivial solutions to eqs.(2.4b) is the (n, n  2)th dolbeault cohomology group

ba = h n,n2

a;p (z) :=

{b  n,n2(z, g) : ab = 0}
{b = a,   n,n3(z, g)}

,

(2.9)

which is dened to be the space of equivalence classes of a-closed g-valued (n, n  2)-forms on z,
modulo a-exact g-valued (n, n  2)-forms. so, the space of nontrivial solutions to eqs.(2.4b) forms
the vector space ba depending on a solution a0,1 of eqs.(2.4a). therefore the space of solutions
to eqs.(2.4) forms a vector bundle t  n , the base space of which is the space n of solutions to
eqs.(2.4a), and bers of the bundle t at the points a0,1  n are the vector spaces h n,n2
a;p (z) = ba
of nontrivial solutions to eqs.(2.4b).

recall that the gauge group g acts on solutions (a0,1, b) of eqs.(2.4) by formulas (2.6). there-
fore, identifying points (a0,1, b)  t and (g1a0,1g + g1 g, g1bg)  t for any g  g, we obtain
the moduli space

m = t /g

5

(2.10)

of solutions to eqs.(2.4). the space m is a vector bundle over the moduli space m of at (0, 1)-
connections. if we denote by [a0,1] the gauge equivalence class of a at (0, 1)-connection a0,1, then
the ber of this bundle at the point [a0,1]  m will be isomorphic to the dolbeault cohomology
group h n,n2
a;p (z). thus, non-abelian holomorphic bf theories give a eld-theoretic description of
holomorphic structures on bundles p  z and of the twisted dolbeault complex on z.

2.2 abelian models

in the abelian case, instead of a g-valued (0, 1)-connection on a bundle over a complex manifold z
one can take any (p, q  1)-form ap,q1  p,q1(z) and introduce the action

shab = zz

bnp,nq  ap,q1,

(2.11)

where bnp,nq  np,nq(z), i.e. bnp,nq is a c-valued (n  p, n  q)-form on z. equations of
motion following from (2.11) are

ap,q1 = 0,
bnp,nq = 0.

(2.12a)

(2.12b)

the action (2.11) and eqs.(2.12) are invariant under the following symmetry transformations:

ap,q1 7 ap,q1 + p,q2,

bnp,nq 7 bnp,nq + np,nq1,

(2.13a)

(2.13b)

where r,s  r,s(z). therefore the moduli space of solutions to eqs.(2.12) is a vector space

mhab = h p,q1



(z)  h np,nq



(z),

(2.14)

where h r,s
with a eld-theoretic description of the standard dolbeault complex on z.

 (z) is the (r, s)th dolbeault cohomology group of z. so, the action (2.11) provides us

3 solvability of holomorphic bf theories

in this section we describe a procedure for constructing solutions to eld equations (2.4) of holo-
morphic bf theories and argue that they are completely solvable.

3.1 from a0,1 to 

equations (2.4a) are equations on globally dened g-valued (0, 1)-forms a0,1 on a complex manifold
z. let us x a covering u = {u,   i} of z. then a (0, 1)-form a0,1 can be restricted to us,
and for any u we obtain the equations

a() + a()  a() = 0

(3.1a)

on a() := a0,1|u. on nonempty intersections u  u of charts the compatibility conditions

a() = a()

6

(3.1b)

must be satised since a0,1 = {a()} is globally dened. so, we have a collection of eqs.(3.1) on a
collection {a()} of g-valued (0, 1)-forms on z.

for eqs.(3.1a) on an open set u one can write out a general solution

a() = ( )1
 ,

(3.2)

where  is a smooth g-valued function on u. substituting (3.2) into the compatibility conditions
(3.1b), we obtain dierential equations

on a collection  = {} of g-valued functions. one should emphasize that these equations are
dened on the union of open sets u  u,

( )1

 = ( )1


(3.3)

u (1) = [,i

u  u,

(3.4)

where the summation is carried out in all ,   i for which u  u 6= .

recall that for elements g = {g} of the gauge group g, the equalities g = g take place on

u  u 6= . the group g acts on  = {} by the formula

g  g :  7 g = g1 = {g1

 }.

(3.5)

it follows from (3.5) that solutions  = {} of eqs.(3.3) leads to nontrivial solutions of eqs.(3.1)
only if  6=  on u  u 6= .

3.2 from  to a0,1

denote by x the space of solutions to eqs.(3.3) and dene a map

0 : x  n

given by the formula

0() = ( )1 = {( )1

 },

(3.6a)

(3.6b)

where  = {}  x. recall that we denote by n the space of solutions to eqs.(2.4a).

it is not dicult to see that for any {}  x we have {h1

 }  x if hs are holomorphic

g-valued functions on u,

h = 0.

(3.7)
 }  x are mapped by 0 into the same at (0,1)-connection a0,1 =
moreover, such {}, {h1
{a()} = { 1
 }. we denote by h the set of all collections h = {h} of holomorphic locally
dened g-valued functions. the set h is a group under the pointwise multiplication: h = {h}
for h = {h},  = {}  h. so, it follows from (3.6) that the space n of at (0, 1)-connections
can be identied with the space of orbits of the group h in the space x of solutions to eqs.(3.3),

n  h\x.

(3.8)

remember that the moduli space m of at (0, 1)-connections is the quotient space (2.8a) of
n by the equivalence relation induced by the action of the gauge group g. comparing (2.8) and
(3.8), we obtain a bijection

m  h\x/g.

7

(3.9)

recall that the groups h and g act on x by the formulas

h  h :  7 h1 = {h1

 },

g  g :  7 g1 = {g1

 },

(3.10a)

(3.10b)

where h = {h}  h, g = {g}  g,  = {}  x. finally, comparing (2.8b) and (3.6a), we obtain
a (composite) map

  0 : x

0
 n  m

(3.11)

of x onto m.

3.3 from  to b

now let us consider eqs.(2.4b) on globally dened g-valued (n, n  2)-forms b on z. restricting
a0,1 and b in eqs.(2.4b) to open sets us, we obtain the equations

b() + a()  b()  b()  a() = 0,

b() = b() on u  u 6= ,

(3.12a)

(3.12b)

for a collection b = {b()} of elds b(), ,   i. it is not dicult to verify that for a xed a()
from (3.2) any solution of eqs.(3.12a) has the form

b() = b()

0 1
 ,

where b()

0

is an arbitrary solution of the equations

b()

0 = 0.

(3.13)

(3.14a)

the compatibility conditions (3.12b) for b = {b()} lead to the following compatibility conditions
for b0 = {b()

0 }:

b()
0 = fb()

0 f 1
 ,

(3.14b)

where f := 1
fs are holomorphic matrices on u  u.

 , and  = {} satises eqs.(3.3). from (3.3) it is not dicult to derive that

to sum up, one can easily construct solutions

b = b01 = {b()

0 1

 } = {b()}

(3.15)

of eqs.(2.4b) if one knows solutions of eqs.(3.3) and eqs.(3.14). moreover, the solution space of
eqs.(3.14) is the standard dolbeault cohomology group

h n,n2

; p

(z) =

{ -closed ad p -valued (n, n  2)-forms on z}
{ -exact ad p -valued (n, n  2)-forms on z}

,

(3.16)

where p and ad p = p g g are holomorphic bundles dened by the transition functions {f} =
{1

 }. that is why we shall concentrate on describing solutions of eqs.(2.4a) and eqs.(3.3).

8

3.4 from 1-cocycles to the moduli space of holomorphic structures

we consider the space x of solutions to eqs.(3.3). taking any  = {}  x, for each nonempty
intersection u  u of charts we introduce matrices f := 1
  dened on u  u. from (3.3)
one can easily derive that fs are holomorphic g-valued functions on u  us. it is not dicult
to verify that restrictions of these matrices to any nonempty intersection u  u  u satisfy the
functional equations

f|f|f| = 1,

(3.17a)

where f| means the restriction of f to an open set u  u  u.

let us now consider a free collection f = {f} of holomorphic matrices f on u  u 6= 
and suppose that {f} satises functional equations (3.17a). recall that solutions of eqs.(3.17a)
are called 1-cocycles. denote by f the subset of those solutions f = {f} to eqs.(3.17a), for which
there exist a collection  = {} of smooth g-valued functions  on u such that

using equations f = 0, one can easily show that these {} will satisfy eqs.(3.3), i.e.  =
{}  x.

f = 1

 .

(3.17b)

we dene a map

 : x  f

given for any  = {}  x by the formula

({}) = {1

 } = f.

(3.18a)

(3.18b)

it is easy to see that if g = {g} is an element of the gauge group g, then  = {}  x and
g1 = {g1
 }
of eqs.(3.17). therefore the space f of solutions to functional eqs.(3.17) can be identied with
the space of orbits of the group g in the set x,

 }  x are projected by the map (3.18) into the same solution f = () = {1

f  x/g.

(3.19)

remember that on the space x we have an action not only of the group g but also of the
group h introduced in sect.3.2. the action (3.10a) induces the following action of h on matrices
f = 1

 :

h  h : f 7 f = hfh1
 .

(3.20)

recall that a collection f = {f} of holomorphic matrices satisfying eqs.(3.17a) is called a 1-
cocycle, and the 1-cocycle f = { f} from (3.20) is considered as (holomorphically) equivalent to
the 1-cocycle f = {f}. by introducing the quotient space

h\f  h\x/g

(3.21)

of equivalence classes of 1-cocycles satisfying eqs.(3.17), we obtain the moduli space h\f of solu-
tions to functional equations (3.17).

comparing formulas (2.8a), (3.9) and (3.21), we obtain bijections

m  n /g  h\x/g  h\f,

(3.22)

9

where m is the moduli space of holomorphic structures on a bundle p  z. let us denote by p a
canonical projection

combining (3.18) and (3.23), we obtain a composite map

p : f  m.

p   : x



 f

p

 m

of x onto m (cf.(3.11)).

(3.23)

(3.24)

3.5 commutative diagram of maps and solvability

comparing all the maps of solution spaces described above, we obtain the following commutative
diagram:

x

0   

n

f

   p

m

(3.25)

here x is the solution space of dierential equations (3.3), n is the space of at (0, 1)-connections,
f is the solution space of functional equations (3.17), and m is the moduli space of at (0, 1)-
connections on g-bundles p  z.

recall that eqs.(2.4a) are dened on a manifold

eqs.(3.3) are dened on the subset

u (0)  z = [i

u,

u (1) = [,i

u  u

of z, and eqs.(3.17) are dened on the subset

u (2) = [,,i

u  u  u

(3.26a)

(3.26b)

(3.26c)

of a manifold z. of course, the summation in (3.26b) and (3.26c) is carried out over , , ... for
which u  u 6=  and u  u  u 6= . our main statement is that for nding at (0, 1)-
connections (and their moduli) one may solve either eqs.(2.4a) on u (0) or eqs.(3.3) on u (1) or
eqs.(3.17) on u (2).

complete solvability of holomorphic bf theories follows from the well-known results of defor-
mation theory [12]. suppose we have found a at (0, 1)-connection a0,1 = {a()}  n , a collection
 = {}  x such that a() =  1
 }  f. then if
we take an arbitrary holomorphic 1-cocycle f = { f} such that matrices f are suciently close

 and a 1-cocycle f = {f} = {1

10

(in some norm) to matrices f, then there will exist a collection  = { } of smooth g-valued
functions  on u such that

(3.27)

f = 1


.

in other words, small enough deformations do not change the topological trivializability of holo-
morphic bundles.

it is not dicult to verify that  = { } from (3.27) satises eqs.(3.3) and therefore a0,1 :=
0( ) =   1 satises eqs.(2.4a). thus, for a given at (0, 1)-connection a0,1  n , one can
obtain any at (0, 1)-connection a0,1  n from an open neighborhood of a0,1 in n . the described
procedure

a0,1 7  7 f 7 f 7  7 a0,1

(3.28)
of constructing at connections can be repeated by using a0,1 as a new seed solution of eqs.(2.4a)
and choosing a holomorphic 1-cocycle { f} suciently close to { f}. then splitting { f} by
formulas (3.27), one can nd   x, a0,1  n and b  b a. with the help of this dressing
procedure one can obtain any solution of eqs.(2.4).

4 special holomorphic bf theories

4.1 hermitian-yang-mills connections and stable bundles

let z be a kahler n-manifold with a kahler form , and gr be a subgroup of the unitary group
u (l) such that (gr)c = gr  c = g, l  2. we consider a (trivial) principal gr-bundle pr over z
and the (0, 1)-component a0,1 of a unitary connection 1-form a = a1,0 + a0,1 on pr.

recall that any unitary connection a on pr denes a holomorphic structure on a g-bundle p
over z if the (0, 1)-component a0,1 of a is at, i.e. satises eqs.(2.4a). connections a are called
hermitian-yang-mills connections, if their curvature fa satises the following equations [13, 14]:

where

f 0,2
a = 0,

n1  f 1,1

a = 0,

f 0,2
a = a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1,

(4.1a)

(4.1b)

(4.2a)

f 1,1
a = a0,1 + a1,0 + a1,0  a0,1 + a0,1  a1,0.

(4.2b)
hermitian-yang-mills connections correspond to stable holomorphic structures a on a bundle [13,
14], but this is in some sense most of them since the moduli space of stable holomorphic structures
is a dense subset in the moduli space of all holomorphic structures on a bundle.

notice that eqs.(4.1) can be rewritten in the form

f 0,2
a = 0,

f 1,1

a = 0,

(4.3a)

(4.3b)

where  is an algebraic trace operator which measures the component of a (1, 1)-form parallel to
 [13]. in local coordinates {za} on z, eqs.(4.3) have the form

fab = 0,

11

(4.4a)

(4.4b)
where g = {gab} is a riemannian metric compatible with the complex structure on z. equa-
tions (4.3) appear in superstring theory from the condition of preserving at least one unbroken
supersymmetry in four dimensions after compactication of d = 10 superstrings on calabi-yau
3-folds [15].

gabfab = 0,

the study of eqs.(4.1) or equivalent eqs.(4.3) is of interest because of their importance in
algebraic geometry and superstring theory. we introduce an action that leads to equations of
motion containing eqs.(4.1). namely, consider the action

shym = shbf + sf = zz

tr (b  f 0,2

a  n1  f 1,1
a ),

(4.5)

where  is a smooth g-valued function on z and  is a constant parameter. the action (4.5) is a
one-parameter deformation of the action shbf for holomorphic bf theories introduced in sect.2.1.
let us emphasize that the action shym depends on a kahler form  on z.

the eld equations following from the action (4.5) are

f 0,2
a = 0,

n1  f 1,1

a = 0,

b + a0,1  b  b  a0,1 = (n1) + n1  [a1,0, ],

(n1) + n1  [a0,1, ] = 0,

(4.6a)

(4.6b)

(4.6c)

where [, ] is the standard commutator in the lie algebra g. we see that eqs.(4.6a) coincide with
eqs.(4.1) and therefore a = a1,0 + a0,1 is a hermitian-yang-mills connection. it is obvious that if
 = 0 then eqs.(4.6) coincide with eqs.(2.4) of a holomorphic bf theory.

4.2 holomorphic bf theories on calabi-yau manifolds

let now z be a calabi-yau n-fold. this means that besides a complex structure, on z there exist
a kahler 2-form , a ricci-at kahler metric g and a nowhere vanishing holomorphic (n, 0)-form
. the (n, 0)-form  can be taken to be covariantly constant w.r.t. the levi-civita connection.
we consider a (trivial) principal g-bundle p over z and the (0, 1)-component a0,1 of a connection
1-form a on p .

for bundles p over calabi-yau (cy) n-folds z one can consider holomorphic bf theories with
the action (2.3) which does not depend on kahler structures, metrics and holomorphic (n, 0)-forms
on z. but the existence on z of a nowhere degenerate holomorphic (n, 0)-form  permits one to
introduce one more class of models which will be called holomorphic bf theories. their action
has the form

shbf = zz

  tr (b  f 0,2

a ),

(4.7)

where b is a g-valued (0, n  2)-form on z, and f 0,2
a = a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 is the (0, 2)-component
of the curvature tensor of a connection a on p . the action (4.7) leads to the equations of motion

  f 0,2

a = 0,

  ( b + a0,1  b  (1)nb  a0,1) = 0

which are equivalent to the equations

a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 = 0,

12

(4.8)

(4.9a)

b + a0,1  b  (1)nb  a0,1 = 0.

(4.9b)

in abridged notation, eqs.(4.9b) can be rewritten as ab = 0.

from eqs.(4.9) we see that holomorphic bf theories describe holomorphic structures on bun-
dles p  z and a-closed forms b  0,n2(z, g). constructing solutions to eqs.(4.9a) was
described in detail in sect.3. as to eqs.(4.9b), their solutions have the form (3.13)-(3.15), where as
b0 one should take a -closed g-valued (0, n  2)-form on z instead of a -closed g-valued (n, n  2)-
form. therefore for any xed at (0, 1)-connection a0,1 on p the space of nontrivial solutions to
eqs.(4.9b) is the (0, n  2)th dolbeault cohomology group

h 0,n2

a;p :=

{b  0,n2(z, g) : ab = 0}
{b = a,   0,n3(z, g)}

.

(4.10)

so, the action (4.7) provides us with a eld-theoretic description of the dolbeault complex coupled
to a at (0, 1)-connection on the adjoint bundle adp .

4.3 special hbf theories on twistor spaces of self-dual 4-manifolds

let us consider a riemannian real 4-manifold m with self-dual weyl tensor (a self-dual manifold)
and the bundle  : z  m of complex structures on m (the twistor space of m ) with cp 1 as a
typical ber [16, 17]. the twistor space z of a self-dual 4-manifold m is a complex 3-manifold [17]
which is the total space of a ber bundle over m associated with the bundle of orthonormal frames
on m . for details see e.g. [18].

it is well known that yang-mills instantons on m can be described in terms of holomorphic
bundles over the twistor space z of m . namely, there is a one-to-one correspondence between self-
dual bundles (bundles with self-dual connections) over m and holomorphic bundles p over z that
are holomorphically trivial on any projective line cp 1
x  z parametrized by x  m [19, 20, 17, 21].
the condition of holomorphic trivializability of the bundle p after the restriction of p to every
projective line in z is equivalent to the equality to zero of the restriction of the (0, 1)-component
a0,1 of a connection a on p to submanifolds cp 1
x  z, x  m (see [22] for discussions). such
connections on p can be described in terms of holomorphic bf theories on z by adding a term to
the action (2.3). in this way we obtain a model which describes the instanton moduli space and
diers from the donaldson-witten model.

consider the twistor space z of a self-dual real 4-manifold m . by denition, z is a complex
bered 3-manifold with the canonical projection  : z  m . the typical ber cp 1 has the su (2)-
invariant complex structure j (see [23] for more details), and the vertical distribution v = ker 
inherits this complex structure. a restriction of v to each ber cp 1
x , x  m , is the tangent bundle
to that ber. the levi-civita connection on the riemannian manifold m generates the splitting
of the tangent bundle t (z) into a direct sum

t (z) = v  h

(4.11)

of the vertical v and horizontal h distributions. using the complex structures on cp 1 and z, one
can split the complexied tangent bundle of z into a direct sum

t c(z) = t 1,0  t 0,1 = (v 1,0  h1,0)  (v 0,1  h0,1)

(4.12)

13

of subbundles of type (1, 0) and (0, 1). analogously one can split the complexied cotangent bundle
of z into a direct sum of subbundles t1,0 and t0,1. so we have the (integrable) distribution v 0,1 of
(0, 1)-vector elds.

let e3,3 be a g-valued (3, 3)-form on z, and v 0,1 be an arbitrary antiholomorphic vector eld
from the distribution v 0,1. denote by {ea}, {ea}, {a} and {a} local frames for the bundles t 1,0,
t 0,1, t1,0 and t0,1, respectively. then locally

e3,3 = ea1...a3a1  ...  a3,

v 0,1 = v aea,

where a1, a1, ... = 1, 2, 3. let us consider the contraction

v 0,1

(4.14a)

of v 0,1 with e3,3, which is a g-valued (3, 2)-form on z.

in the local frames, v 0,1

we also introduce a g-valued function

to the action (2.3) of a holomorphic bf theory we add the term

where  = const. the action

shbf + svae = zz

tr [b3,1  f 0,2

leads to the following eld equations:

a0,1 + a0,1  a0,1 = 0,

b3,1 + a0,1  b3,1  b3,1  a0,1 = v 0,1

(4.14b)

(4.14c)

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18a)

(4.18b)

equations (4.18a) on the twistor space z of a self-dual 4-manifold m are equivalent to the self-dual
yang-mills (sdym) equations on m , which was discussed in detail in [22, 23]. equations (4.18b)
describe some elds interacting with external self-dual gauge elds on m . it is obvious that in the
limit   0, eqs.(4.18) are reduced to eqs.(2.4) of holomorphic bf theories on z.

14

4.4 conformal eld theories related to special hbf theories

it is well known that chern-simons theories on 3d real manifolds x are reduced to 2d conformal
eld theories (cft) if one supposed that a 3-manifold x has the form of a trivial bundle   r
(or   s1), where  is a 2-manifold [2, 24, 25].
it is reasonably to expect that holomorphic
analogs of chern-simons and bf theories dened on a 3d complex manifold z (six real dimensions)
can be reduced to 4d cfts if one supposes that z is a bundle over a real 4-manifold m with
two-dimensional bers. one important example of a conformal eld theory in four dimensions is
provided by the sdym model. in sect.4.3 we have described the reduction of holomorphic bf
models on z to sdym models on self-dual 4-manifolds m . for discussions of reductions to other
4d cfts see [22].

notice that hermitian-yang-mills connections (see sect.4.1) on bundles p over complex 2-
dimensional kahler manifolds are self-dual connections since eqs.(4.6a) for n = 2 coincide with the
sdym equations. thus, both the action (4.5) with n = 2 and the action (4.17) describe sdym
models on 4-manifolds. in the simplest case of the at 4-space, we obtain sdym models on r4.
it is well known that almost all integrable equations in 1  d  3 dimensions (korteweg-de vries,
nonlinear schrodinger, boussinesq and many others) can be obtained by reductions of the sdym
equations on r4 (see [26, 27, 28, 29, 30] and references therein). thus, special holomorphic bf
theories are connected with 4d cfts and integrable models in 1  d  4 dimensions.

5 observables and topological invariants

to introduce observables and topological invariants for holomorphic bf and bf theories we use
results on holomorphic analogs of chern-simons theories dened on calabi-yau 3-folds [8, 9, 10, 11].
first, for an action s coinciding with (2.3), (2.11) or (4.7), one can write down the partition

function

zk = za/g

da0,1 exp(iks),

(5.1)

where k  z, and the path integral is evaluated over the space a/g of gauge inequivalent (0, 1)-
connections a0,1 on a bundle p  z.

second, using the semiclassical approximation, one can give the partition function interpretation

of the ray-singer holomorphic torsion [31] of the holomorphic bundle (adp, a).

third, one can introduce an analog of wilson loops for abelian (0, 1)-connections a0,1 on a line
bundle l  z [11]. for this one should x complex curves ci  z (e.g. tori), holomorphic 1-forms
i on the cis and dene

t (ci) = exp(ikzci

i  a0,1)

(5.2)

as an element of the jacobian of l paired against i and exponentiated. then we can consider the
path integral

za/g

da0,1 exp(iks)

t (ci)

yi=1

(5.3)

m

and try to prove that it is an invariant of the complex structure of a manifold z.

finally, for abelian holomorphic bf theories with the action (2.11) one can introduce the
dolbeault currents [32] and dene the linking number of complex submanifolds of a manifold z
using pairing h p,q

(z)  c of the dolbeault cohomology groups.

 (z)  h np,nq



15

we have written down a number of formally metric independent path integrals for hbf and
hbf theories. it is reasonably to expect that they are invariants of a complex manifold z, but to
prove this is not an easy task. a lot of work need to be done.

6 conclusion

in this paper we have introduced new classes of gauge eld theories which are natural holomorphic
analogs of bf topological theories. these new models give a eld-theoretic description of holomor-
phic structures on bundles over complex, kahler and calabi-yau n-manifolds. in particular, for
stable holomorphic bundles we obtain lagrangian description of hermitian-yang-mills connections.
such connections are often used in superstring theory in description of compactied congurations
with unbroken supersymmetry in four dimensions [15].

there are many open problems that have to be considered. in particular, it is necessary to
analyze the ghost structure of the introduced theories, to perform brst gauge xing and to write
down quantum actions. supersymmetrization of holomorphic bf theories may be of interest. the
problem of nding nontrivial observables and their metric independence should be more carefully
analyzed. much work remains to be done.
