abstract

we propose a method to derive the low-energy efective action of qcd assuming that

the long-distance properties of strong interactions can be described by a string theory.

we bypass the usual problems related to the existence of the tachyon and absence of

the adequate adler zero by using a sigma model approach where excitations above the

correct (chirally non-invariant) qcd vacuum are included. two-dimensional conformal
invariance then implies the vanishing of the o(p4) eective lagrangian coecients. we

discuss ways to go beyond this limit.

introduction

there are many theoretical and empirical reasons that make us believe that it should be

possible to describe qcd in terms of a string theory[1], at least in some kinematical regime.

the more commonly cited arguments are the dominance of planar diagrams in the large n

limit[2] lling in a surface (interpreted as the world-sheet of a string), the expansion in

terms of surfaces built out of plaquettes in strong-coupling lattice qcd[3], and the success of

regge phenomenology[4], which can ultimately be understood in terms of string theory ideas

(although, as we will discuss a little bit later, the actual regge theory that corresponds to

qcd cannot be derived, at present, from any known string theory).

to these we could add two more reasons. one is the appeareance in string theory of

the universal (at least at long distances) luscher term[5]. the static interquark potential

provided by the string v (r) = r + c gets modied by quantum uctuations by a coulomb-

like piece /12r, a term which come very handy when tting the string interquark potential

to heavy quark spectra. finally, and in a completely dierent context, namely that of deep
inelastic scattering, the evolution of the parton distribution down to low values of q2 (around
(2 gev)2) leads[6] to a low x behaviour for the structure functions of the form x1.17, while
regge theory predicts x1, in striking good agreement.

thus, that there is a string description of qcd is almost evident. which is the appropriate

string theory for qcd, however? to answer this question one should rst ask oneself which

is the kinematical regime where the string picture would be applicable. it is manifestly hard

to reconcile the string picture and high energy processes, such as deep inelastic scattering,

where the point-like structure of quarks and gluons is apparent. while it is quite conceivable

that non-abelian gauge theories could one day be understood in terms of a given string theory

(cf. the interesting recent developments about the ads/cft relationship[7]), it is also quite

obvious that this will never be the natural language to understand high-energy processes. we

should probably be less ambitious and satisfy ourselves with an eective description.

not surprisingly, a lot of candidates have been put forward as possible candidates of

the qcd string, ranging from the original nambu-goto string[8] to the supersymmetric

string[9] and from the rigid string[10] to the ve-dimensional string with manifest zig-zag

symmetry[11]. most, if not all, of the candidates are believed to be understood as eective

theories, valid only up to some characteristic momentum transfer kmax, and at the (string)
tree level, lest the inconsistencies of string theory away from the critical dimensions show up.

we subscribe this point of view and think of strings as eective theories and not worry at all

about their mathematical consistency as fundamental objects.

2

it is surprising that even with this limited scope all known string theories are inconsistent

and cannot provide a description of low energy qcd, even for k  kmax. to see how this
comes about let us remember the original veneziano amplitude[12]. after decorating it with
the appropriate chan-paton[13] factors1 it is supposed to describe the scattering amplitude

of four pions

a(ab  cd)  tr(t at bt ct d)a(s, t) + non cyclic permutations,

a(s, t) =

((s))((t))
((s)  (t))

,

(1)

(2)

where (s) = (0) + s is the regge trajectory. the inverse string tension  is to be

determined latter. in the nambu-goto string, from which this amplitude is deduced, (0) =

1.

in the above expression we immediately recognize that there are poles in the s-channel

whenever s = n  (0). thus a tachyon is present for n = 0.

supersymmetric strings. in the neveu-schwarz (bosonic) sector (0) = 1

the supersymmetric string[9] does not really fare any better. there are two sectors in
2 and there exist a
(scalar/pseudoscalar) tachyon too. in regge parlance the spectrum in this sector is described
by the pion trajectory (s) = (0) + s, corresponding to negative g-parity, and by the
rho trajectory, corresponding to positive g-parity, (s) = (s) + 1
2 . usually one performs
the gso projection[14], projecting out the tachyon. however one may choose not to do so

and compute the four-tachyon amplitude, supposed to describe pion-pion scattering, which

is mediated by the exchange of particles in the -trajectory. the corresponding amplitude is

or

a(s, t) =

(1  (s))(1  (t))

(1  (s)  (t))

,

a(s, t) =

(s)(t)
(s  t  1)

.

(3)

(4)

this is the lovelace-shapiro amplitude, which contains no tachyonic poles. could it be a

candidate to describe pion scattering? the answer is no. it does not have the appropriate

adler zero, i.e. the property that at s = t = 0 the amplitude vanishes.

a x[15] to this problem is to replace by hand (s) by (s). the amplitude becomes

a(s, t) =

( 1

2  s)( 1
(s  t)

2  t)

.

(5)

1due to diculties with unitarity only orthogonal groups can be introduced in this way, but since there

are other inconsistencies one should not worry too much at this point.

3

with poles in the s-channel when s = n + 1
2 it has no tachyons and the rst pole is identied
with the  particle, thus xing . furthermore, the previous amplitude has the right adler

zero. based on this amplitude polyakov and vereshagin[16] have derived the rst coecients

of the eective chiral lagrangian and have found that

l1 =

1
2

l2,

l2 =

f 2

8m2


ln 2,

l3 = 2l2.

(6)

numerically they turn out to be quite acceptable values2, but unfortunately there is no way

to justify the apparently arbitrary change in the intercept.

an attempt to solve the diculties associated to the presence of the tachyon is the for-

mulation of the rigid string[10], where four derivative interactions contained in the second

fundamental form modify the string behaviour at short distances. classically at least, the

regge trajectories are modied[17], making it conceivable that the tachyon is avoided. un-

fortunately, the classical trajectories are no more straight lines, something with ample phe-

nomenological support and thus a highly desirable property to preserve. while the spectrum

of the rigid string has not been determined at the quantum level (the theory is not exactly

solvable), it seems unlikely at this point that it provides a satisfactory solution by itself, even

though it may be part of the solution, as we will later see.

for a long time it has been thought that the ultimate reason for the presence of a tachyon

in the spectrum lies in a wrong choice of the vacuum[18]. since the choice of the vertex

operator, v (k) =: exp ikx :, is based on the lorentz properties alone, it is the same both

for scalar and pseudoscalars and, accordingly, both scalars and pseudoscalars have tachyonic

poles in the s-channel on account of parity conservation. the situation is thus parallel to
the one in multicomponent 4 when perturbing around  = 0 gives negatives values for
all components of m2.

it is natural to assume that the amplitudes obtained through the

use of the canonical vertex operators correspond to (unphysical) amplitudes for excitations

perturbed around the wrong vacuum.

these ideas are certainly not new, but how could one obtain the amplitudes for excitations

around the physically correct vacuum? we propose to use two ingredients to try and give a

partial answer to this question.

the rst one is to identify the proper physical degrees of freedom.

in this case, the

relevant degrees of freedom are the ones emerging after the spontaneous breaking of chiral

symmetry. in the physical vacuum of qcd there is a clear distinction between scalars (sigma

particle) and pseudoscalars (pions). the pseudoscalars can be collected in a unitary matrix

2the rst relation, l1 = l2/2, is a consequence of the large n (planar) limit.

4

u (x) which under chiral tranformations belonging to su (3)l  su (3)r transforms as

u (x)  u (x) = lu (x)r

(7)

u (x) is nothing but a bunch of couplings involving the variables x, from the string point of

view.

nobody knows how to write a vertex operator for string excitations above a non-trivial

vacuum, such as the one existing in qcd. a possible way out is provided by our second

ingredient, namely conformal invariance. we propose to use a sigma model technique and

request the vanishing of the corresponding beta functional for the couplings u (x). from these

we shall eventually derive the appropriate long distance eective action of qcd.

conformal invariance amounts to demanding that the theory is independent of the specic

conformal factor chosen to describe the two-dimensional world sheet. while this is a desirable

property of fundamental strings, it need not be necessarily so (if we look at the qcd string

with a magnifying glass we shall eventually see quarks and gluons, not the string itself!),

so we should rather demand conformal covariance. let us assume for the time being that

conformal invariance is approximately true, however, and we shall later briey mention how

to move away from this zeroth order approximation.

2 the model

in order to obtain the long distance qcd eective action from the qcd string we follow the

strategy used[19] to derive einstein equations from string theory, namely, the non-linear 

model approach.

we couple, in a chiral invariant manner, the matrix in avour space u (x), containing the

meson elds, to the string degrees of freedom while preserving general covariance in the two

dimensional coordinates and conformal invariance under local scale transformations of the

two-dimensional metric tensor.

the equations of motion for the u eld will be obtained from the condition that the

quantum theory must be conformally invariant, i.e. the  functional for the u (x) couplings

must vanish.

since the string variable x does not contain any avor dependence, we have to invent a

way to couple it to the background u variable. we introduce two fermion families living on

the boundary of the string sheet. they carry avor indices. the action for the fermions is

1

2 z

d ( lu

r




 l


u r) + h.c.,

(8)

5

where  is the coordinate along the (open) string boundary. physically the labels r and

l remind us that these one dimensional grassmann variables represent massless quarks of

a given chirality moving along the ends of the string, and coupled to the external source

u (x). under su (3)l  su (3)r they transform as left- and right-handed elds do. the above

lagrangian is not unique, but it appears to be the simplest one with the desired properties.
moreover, in order to simplify the calculations, we treat the couplings u and u + as

independent. the constraint

u u + = 1

(9)

will be imposed after nding the equations of motion for an arbitrary matrix u . the reason is

simply that we do not know of an easy way to nd the beta function for constrained coupling

constants.

it is easy to see that this action is invariant under general coordinate transformations of

the two dimensional world sheet by writing it as follows

1

2 z

d

dx
d

( lu

r
x + . . . =

1

2 z

dx( lu

r
x + . . . ,

(10)

where dx
d

is the tangent vector to the boundary of the two dimensional surface of the string

and the fermions are treated as scalars under general coordinate transformations. the fermion

action is automatically conformally invariant, because it does not contain the two dimensional

world sheet metric tensor since it can be written as a line integral.

notice that u (x) has support only on the boundary of the string. the above boundary

action has to be supplemented with the usual bulk action for the string in the conformal

gauge. namely

1

 z dd axax.

(11)

unless otherwise indicated we take  = 1.

3 one loop

now we expand u (x( )) around a constant background x0 and look for the potentially di-
vergent one particle irreducible diagrams (opi). we classify them according to the number

of loops.

the appropriate feynman rules for the bosonic and fermionic propagators are

hxa( )xb( )i = abf (   )

(12)

6

hl( ) r( )i = u (x0)1(   )  d0(   )

(13)

here f is the feynman propagator for the string coordinate x. the vertices obtained after

the expansion of u (x) around x0 lead to the following feynman rule for a vertex with n
external x elds

vn = 

1
n!

1,2,...nu (x0)

(14)

to renormalize the propagator we have, at this order, the diagrams shown in gure 1.

these are the only one loop graphs with two fermion legs and zero string legs. the calculation

is straightforward and we immediately get for the divergent part of the propagator



1
2

u 1(

1
2

u  u u 1u )u 1(   )

(15)

where dimensional regularization has been used. the  pole comes from the singular part of
f (0) which also contains the factor e. thus conformal invariance will be broken at the
one loop level unless

1
2

u  u u 1u = 0

(16)

these are the equations of motion of the u eld. later we will supplement them with the

unitarity constraint. the fermion propagator can be made nite by using minimal subtraction

and redening accordingly

u (x0)1  u (x0)1 + (2)u (x0)1.

with (2)u 1 given by

(2)u 1 =

1
2

u 1(

1
2

u  u u 1u )u 1.

(17)

(18)

next we turn to the vertices with one x- and two x-elds. the relevant diagrams are

shown in gures 2 and 3, respectively. a direct calculation, and the use of

u = u u 1u,

shows that the counterterm needed to cancel the divergent part for the former is just

(2)v1 = u  ,

while the conterterm of the latter is

(2)v2 = 

1
2

 u  .

7

(19)

(20)

(21)

these expressions will be needed for the two loop calculation.

the vanishing of the beta functional for u (x) can be obtained as the euler-lagrange

variation of a given action s. the true action will however be

s = s + z dnx tr((x)(u (x)u +(x)  1))

it is easy to see that the variation of s produces the equations of motion

u u +  u u + = 0,

(22)

(23)

which are the ones derived from the chiral lagrangian at lowest order (see appendix).

thus we have succeded in deriving a long-distance eective action for qcd with all the

required properties, at least at this order.

4 two loops

in order to compute the two-loop corrections to the fermion propagator in eq.12 one has to

consider rst the diagrams in gure 4. the total result amounts to



1
2

d0(   )2

f (0)t

where t is given by

t =

1
4

o1  o2  o3  o

3 + 2o4 + o5  2o6  2o7 + 2o8 + 2o
8

and the oi operators are dened as

o1 = 2u u 1
o2 =  u u 1 u u 1
o3 = u u 1u u 1
3 = u u 1u u 1
o

o4 = u u 1u u 1 u u 1
o5 = u u 1u u 1u u 1
o6 = u u 1u u 1u u 1u u 1
o7 = u u 1u u 1 u u 1u u 1
o8 =  u u 1u u 1 u u 1
8 = u u 1u u 1 u u 1
o

8

(24)

(25)

(26)

notice the appeareance of four derivatives in the above expressions. the two-loop calculation
is the relevant one for the o(p4) terms of the chiral lagrangian.

in addition we have also the contribution coming from the counterterm diagrams i, ii

and iii appearing in gure 5

d0(   )

1
2

f (0)(di + dii + diii )

(27)

where

di =

1

o5  o7

dii =

(o3 + o

3) + 2o4  2o6 + o8 + o

1
4

o1 

1
2

(o3 + o

3)  o2 + o8 + o

8  o7 +

1
2

o5

thus the counterterm contribution is also proportional to the t operator.

finally, the complete two loop divergent part of the fermion propagator is

1
82 d0(   )t

(28)

(29)

so that no simple  pole appears. the two-loop fermion propagator is made nite with the

help of the counterterm

(4)u 1 = 

1
82 u 1t

(30)

the absence of simple poles at the two loop level implies in minimal subtraction that the

two loop contribution to the beta functional is zero. thus there is no net contribution to the
equation of motion at order ( 1
 factor.) therefore

 )2. (notice that f actually contais a 1

the requirement of conformal invariance implies l1 = l2 = l3 = 0.

5 discussion

is it possible to understand the vanishing of the o(p4) coecients? here we provide a

tentative argument.

one must rst realize that the matrix u (x) is dimensionless and thus cannot solely depend
on x, some dimensional quantity is required. let us call this quantity v (of course, v = f,
but we do not need to know this at his point). then the full action we have written (eqs. (8)

plus (11)) is trivially invariant under the following set of transformations

x  etx,

v  etv,

  e2t,

(31)

9

one may say that this is not really an invariance since we change both elds (which are

integrated over) and couplings (which are not). in fact if this were the full story this would
imply nothing for l1, l2 and l3 since, on dimensional grounds and counting powers of ,
they must be of the form li  v2.

however,

it turns out that conformal invariance would imply that the invariance is
stronger, since the change in  can be absorbed by the shift     2t/ once the theory is

regulated by continuing it away from 2 dimensions. conformal invariance would guarantee

independence of the conformal factor and thus the real invariance of the theory would be

x  etx,

v  etv.

(32)

this would imply l1 = l2 = l3 = 0, in fact all higher order coecients appear to vanish
for exactly the same reasons if this argument holds. in fact, the argument is only tentative,

since the theory is after all not conformally invariant in all sectors since we are away from

the critical dimension.

in real qcd the o(p4) coecients are known to be of order 103. it appears thus that

assuming conformal invariance of the string is not such a bad approximation. after all in

massless qcd the breakdown of scale invariance is only logarithmic, at least in perturbation

theory. (of course the smallness of the li can be understood on other grounds, but these

have nothing to do with the string.)

this suggests that to obtain non-zero values for l1, l2 and l3 one must denitely use
a string action which manifestly breaks conformal invariance. the simplest possibility is to

include the extrinsic curvature term. li would then be proportional to the rigidity coecient.

a detailed analysis of this is now under way.

appendix

at long distances qcd is described by the chiral lagrangian. this is an eective lagrangian

organized in powers of momenta (see e.g. [20] for a general discussion)

where

le = l(2) + l(4) + . . .

l(2) =

f 2

4

tru u ,

(33)

(34)

l(4) = l1(tr(u u ))2 + l2tr(u u )tr(u  u ) + l3tr(u  u u  u ). (35)

the matrix u = exp i aa/2f collects the goldstone bosons associated to the su (3)l 
su (3)r  su (3)v breaking.

the experimental values for these low-energy constants are (at the m scale): l1 =
(0.65  0.28)  103, l2 = (1.90  0.26)  103 and l3 = (3.06  0.92)  103. they
are, generally speaking, well accounted for by either the chiral quark model or vector meson

saturation (the latter, incidentally, explains the good agreement with the lovelace-shapiro

amplitude predictions).
