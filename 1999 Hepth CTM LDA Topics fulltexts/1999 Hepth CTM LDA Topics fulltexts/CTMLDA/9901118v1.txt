abstract

space-time n = 2 and n = 4 superconformal algebras can be built using world-sheet free elds
or, equivalently, free eld representations of osp(1|2) and sl(2|1), respectively. a prescription for the
calculation of space-time correlators is given. as applications we compute one and two-point correlation
functions of virasoro (supervirasoro) generators. we also present a possible scenario for taking into
account of ns vebranes in the framework of our construction for the description of superstring on
ads3. it is nothing but a simplied version of greens world-sheets for world-sheets.

(i) the newest, and perhaps most interesting, of the dualities of string theory is the one conjectured by
maldacena, which relates the large n expansion of gauge theories (conformal eld theories) in d dimensions
to string theory on the product of d + 1-dimensional anti-de sitter (ads) space with a compact manifold
[1].

(i) in fact, the ads/cft correspondence is an example of the t hooft holographic principle according

to which a quantum theory with gravity must be described by a boundary theory [2, 3].

(ii) the greens idea is that the two-dimensional world-sheet underlying the dynamics of string theory
may itself emerge as the embedding space of a two-dimensional string theory which has a more primitive
structure [4].

(iii) in general, a supersymmetry algebra contains central charges that couple to topological quantum

numbers of solitons [5]. in the stringy context these charges are carried by p-branes.

each of these ideas has its own attractive features, so it serves as a subject for numerous investigations.
in particular, the possible relation of string theory on ads3 to conformal eld theory has been a subject
of much interest; see [6, 8-13] for discussions motivated by recent developments, and additional references.
it is amusing, however, that all these ideas can be found as elements of a construction which is superstring
theory on ads3.
it is clear that applying the ideas together should help us with understanding such
construction, so it will be the purpose of this paper.

world-sheet description of superstring theory on ads3 has been initiated by giveon, kutasov and
seiberg [6] who started with the bosonic part of the world-sheet lagrangian or, what is equivalent, with
the g x x  term of the corresponding  model1

approach to the sl(2) wess-zumino-witten model [7].

algebra. the n = 1 superconformal algebra on the world-sheet is achieved by introducing free fermions
that are lower components of superelds. they also succeeded in nding the global n = 4 superconformal
algebra for the neveu-schwarz (ns) sector in space-time.

in spite of certain progress in understanding string propagation on ads3 the description of giveon
and co-workers is subjected to some drawbacks. one of them is that space-time n = 4 algebra (boundary
algebra) is not realized in a manifestly supersymmetric way. moreover, the use of the standard procedure for
building fermionic vertices by [14] does not allow one to explicitly write down all the fermionic generators
of the algebra. recently ito proposed a simple remedy2 to improve the situation. he based on the
wakimoto free eld representations of some ane lie superalgebras [8]. his construction provides the
n = 1, 2, 4 superconformal algebras in space-time through the world-sheet osp(1|2), sl(2|1), sl(2|2) ane
superalgebras, respectively 3.
however, the construction discussed in [6, 8] remains inconsistent because, while the holographic prin-
ciple says that string theory on ads3 is described by a boundary theory, the boundary n = 4 algebra
is built in terms of all ads3 coordinates rather than the boundary ones only; improving this will be the
rst goal of the present paper. moreover, the realization of the number of ns5-branes as the level of the
world-sheet sl(2) algebra does not look attractive too. the point is that it does not allow one to interpret
the central charge of the boundary algebra in a purely topological way (from the world-sheet point of view).
so, this will be our second goal. at the present time it is not known whether these goals may be achieved.
so we are bound to learn something if we succeed.

the outline of the paper is as follows. in section 2 we describe a formal construction for lifting bosonized
ane lie algebras on the world-sheet into two-dimensional space-time. we will not only reproduce the
known results, but nd rather amusing relations between n = 2, 4 superconformal algebras and ane
lie superalgebras osp(1|2), sl(2|1). in particular, such 2d space-time may be considered as the boundary
of ads3. section 3 will present some applications to string on ads3. we give a prescription for the
calculation of space-time correlators and possible mechanism for taking into account ns5-branes in a purely
topological way. section 4 will present the conclusions and directions for future work. in the appendices
we give technical details which are relevant for the explicit construction of the ane lie superalgebras in
space-time and computation of some correlators.

2 superconformal algebras in space-time

in particular, the latter may be the boundary of ads3.

we now turn to the problem of the correspondence between symmetries on the world-sheet and two-
dimensional space-time.
in this case one can
consider a construction by starting with the euclidean version of ads3 whose coordinates are (, , )
and restricting the analysis to the problem of building superconformal algebras in space-time which is the
boundary of ads3 with coordinates (, ) (see subsection 3.1.4 for details). thanks to the underlying
world-sheet structure such construction may be called the stringy representation of ane superalgebras.
however, before we give examples, it might be useful to present some mathematical background.

let p0 be a point on the world-sheet which is a riemann surface and (u0, z) be a coordinate patch
such that p0  u0 and z = 0 for p0. let p be a point on another two-dimensional manifold (space-time)
and (u, ) be a proper coordinate patch. let there is a map  : u0  u, i.e. the local embedding of
integers p which
the world-sheet into space-time. it is useful to classify such maps by their degrees, i.e.

2due to its manifest space-time supersymmetry it looks like an analog of the green-schwarz formulation of superstring for

the problem at hand, so it seems reasonable to pay more attention to this analogy in future research.

3note that the relations between ane and superconformal algebras osp(1|2)  n = 1, sl(2|1)  n = 2, sl(2|2)  n = 4

are also known from the drinfeld-sokolov reduction, which is an entirely dierent topic.

where the contour c0 surrounds 0. thanks to the local construction c0 is contractible on the world-sheet.
in the quantum case p is

z = 1.

the normalization is xed by setting p = 1 for (z) = z i.e., hc0

interpreted as the topological charge4.

2.1 the virasoro case

as a warmup, let us consider the virasoro algebra in space-time and, as by-product, reproduce the result
of [6]. the most obvious way to do this is the following. consider a dierential operator realization of the
virasoro algebra. by substitutions

  (z)

,

  (z)

,

where (z), (z) are now the quantum elds, we get the quantum algebra. this is the standard machinery
for building the wakimoto free eld representation within 2d conformal eld theories.

it is well known that the dierential operator realization for the centerless virasoro algebra is given by

we then take the virasoro generators to be (normal ordering is implied here and below)

ln = n+1

, n  z .

ln = ic0

dz  n+1(z)

.

(2.2)

(2.3)

using the standard techniques (see, e.g., [14]) together with the operator product (op) expansion

(z1)(z2) = 1

+ o(1) we nd5

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +

c
12

(n3  n)n+m,0

,

(2.4)

where the cental charge is c = 12p.

now, let us assume that there is one more free eld on the world-sheet. let it be a scalar eld  whose
op expansion is (z1)(z2) =  ln z12 + o(1). the most obvious generalization of what we have just done
is

ln = ic0

dz  n+1 + f (n)n(z)

.

(2.5)

a simple algebra shows that such dened lns obey (2.4) only for f (n) = (n + 1)f0 with f0 = const. this
improved construction gives the central charge c = 12(1 + f 2

0 )p.

on the other hand, the set of the free elds we used is exactly what one needs to build the wakimoto
free eld representation of the sl(2) algebra. we refer to appendix a for more details. with  and  as
in (a.6) and normal ordering implied in (2.5), the formula for ln is modied to

ln = ic0

(n + 1))n+1j + 2

it is easy to see that the result found in [6] is recovered by inserting f0 =  1

4in the stringy context p is interpreted as the number of innitely stretched fundamental strings at the boundary of ads3

[6]. we will see in section 3 that there is also another interpretation.

5[ln, c] can be shown to be zero.

2.2 the n = 2 case

the generalization of the above construction is obtained simply by adding fermionic coordinates, which
makes the space-time supersymmetry manifest. in the simplest case that we will consider we add a fermionic
coordinate  that geometrically turns space-time into a superspace. in general one would expect the n = 1
superconformal structure for this case. happily, this is not the whole story.
it is easy to see that the

done either by analytic continuation or by bosonization. we will return to this point later in section 3.

algebra starting from the following dierential operators (subset of (2.7))

(2.11)

the analysis proceeds as in above and leads to the n = 1 superconformal algebra with an arbitrary central
charge. for a special case we recover the result by ito [8].

2.3 the n = 4 case

having the n = 2 superconformal algebra, we now wish to realize the n = 4 superconformal algebra in a
similar way. first, by adding two fermionic coordinates , , we turn space-time into a n = 2 superspace.
the rst order fermionic dierential operators which can be constructed out of (, , ) are

i.e., we have two more operators than it is necessary for n = 4. since we are interested in n = 4, we
omit a general analysis of what we can build from this set of operators. as to the dierential operator
realization of the centerless n = 4 superconformal algebra, it is given by

in contrast to the previous examples, the set of the free elds used to build the n = 4 superconformal
algebra is not exactly what we need to construct the wakimoto free elds representation of the sl(2|1)
algebra (see appendix a for details). indeed, the scalar elds dont appear. nevertheless from (a.18) it

finally, let us discuss a relation with the result of ito [8]. to do this we must recall a dierential

operator realization of the centerless n = 2 superconformal algebra. this time it is given by

(2.16)

the analysis proceeds as above and leads to the n = 2 superconformal algebra with an arbitrary central
charge. for a special case we recover the result by ito [8]. moreover, having the n = 2 superconformal
algebra, we can also get the n = 1 algebra as it has been done in the previous subsection.

3 detailed examination of space-time symmetries

after our rather formal discussion of the construction of space-time symmetries and their relation to the
ane lie superalgebras, let us now look more specically at their relation to string theory. the simplest
example to consider is the bosonic part of strings on ads3, i.e. the virasoro algebra in space-time. this
will be the subject of subsection 3.1. later in subsection 3.2 we will generalize our analysis to include
fermions and concentrate on the properties of the n = 4 superconformal algebra in space-time.

6

3.1 the virasoro case

3.1.1 reparametrization invariant vertex operators or more? in general, the string vertex operators creating
physical states are the primary conformal elds. moreover, the reparametrization (conformal) invariance
of the theory dictates that the vertices have dimension one in both z and z so that their integral over dzdz
is invariant (see e.g., [14]). we now wish to apply this to vertex operators (2.6). with the aid of eq.(a.5),
it can be shown that

(cid:16)1 + 2

f0
+

(n + 1)(cid:17)n+1j + 2

f0
+

(n + 1)nj 0(z)

is the primary conformal eld of dimension one only for f0 =  1
giveon and co-workers [6].

2 +. it is exactly what was found by

one of the novelties that appears due to two-dimensional space-time is that it is possible to give another

interpretation. dening the virasoro generators on the world-sheet by the standard way

ln = ic0

dz zn+1(cid:16) 

1
2

 

1
+

2(cid:17)(z)

the stringy denition of the vertex operator (2.6) can be represented by

[ln, lm] = 0 ,

(3.1)

i.e. there are two copies of the virasoro algebra living on the world-sheet and in space-time, respectively and
these algebras commute. one of the reasons why this formulation sounds interesting is that the world-sheet
and space-time appear on the equal footing, independently of which two-dimensional space (world-sheet or
space-time) is primary.

writing down the stringy vertex operator requires that the scalar eld  has a non-zero background
charge, i.e. its central charge obeys c 6= 1. otherwise the integrand is not a primary world-sheet conformal
eld of dimension one. indeed, what happened is the anomaly cancelation between  and . so it is
clear that the construction fails for c = 1. in order to understand what to do, there is a useful piece of
background information we should review. first, let us recall that the su(2) ane lie algebra at the level
k = 1 admits the following representation

j 0(z) =

i
2

(z)

,

j(z) = ei2(z)

.

we then take the space-time su(2) generators to be [6]

t a

n = ic0

dz nj a(z)

.

(3.2)

(3.3)

they obey the commutation relations of su(2) with k = p. so there is a symmetry enhancement in space-
time induced by a proper enhancement on the world-sheet at c = 1. however, the main moral of this story
is that the central charge of ane algebras may have a topological origin! it seems interesting to develop
such approach to ane algebras elsewhere.

3.1.2 bosonization or conformal transformation in space-time. the construction of section 2 has one
drawback: it requires rational powers of the free eld (z) to describe the superconformal algebra sectors
other than the neveu-schwarz sector. though examples of fractional calculus for the (, ) system are
known in the literature (see, e.g., [16] and references therein), it is more advantageous to use the bosoniza-
tion procedure [14]. the reason for this is that a special value for space-time dimension, i.e. d = 2,
allows us to give a geometric interpretation of bosonization. the point of view we propose is the following.
for a given (z) which classically denes the embedding of the world-sheet into the space-time, we can
take (z) = ei1(z)2(z) that is nothing but a conformal transformation to the cylindrical coordinates for

7

space-time. on the other hand, within the quantized  system such representation of (z) is called as
bosonization. thus, we can interpret the bosonization procedure as the quantum version of the conformal
transformation to the cylindrical coordinates in space-time.

at this point, it only remains to illustrate the use of the cylindrical coordinates in the problem at hand.

the general recipe of [14] tells us to set

(z) = ei1(z)2(z)

,

(z) = i1 ei1(z)+2(z)

,

(3.4)

where 1, 2 are the scalar elds with proper background charges and two-point functions normalized as
hi(z1)j(z2)i = ij ln z12.

combining all this, virasoro generators (2.5) turn out to be

ln = ic0

dz en(i12)(cid:16)(n + 1)2 + in1 + f (n)(cid:17)(z)

.

(3.5)

a simple check shows that ln obey (2.4) with f (n) = (n + 1)f0, f0 = const and c = 12(1 + f 2
result of subsection 2.1 is recovered.

0 )p, i.e. the

as regards the operator responsible for the topological charge (2.1), it is given by

p = ic0

dz i1  2(z)

.

(3.6)

an important remark is that p commutes with (z) and (z), i.e. with all the  and  oscillators. in fact,
this operator is equal to qb, so the number p is called the bose-sea level of the representation of the
(, ) algebra [17].
3.1.3 sample calculations of space-time correlators. let us now move towards the world-sheet formula-
tion of perturbative string theory. in general, physical theory is called string theory if it is formulated by
an underlying world-sheet structure. what is best understood presently is the perturbative string theory
in ten-dimensional minkowski space. in this case, the space-time scattering amplitudes in the momentum
representation are given by the functional integral over all two-dimensional matter elds together with all
the geometries of a two-dimensional surface with insertions of the appropriate vertex operators. it seems
natural from the universality principle to follow the same ansatz. then it immediately comes to mind to
dene space-time correlators in the problem in hand. a possible way to do this is7

and conformal dimensions, respectively. we dene the measures of the path integrals so as to have the
two-point functions h(z1)(z2)i =  ln z12, h(z1)(z2)iq = ( z1
before we give examples of computations, we rst want to make one important remark. the point is
that the left-hand side of ansatz (3.7) is a correlator of a proper 2d conformal (superconformal) theory
while a similar ansatz for string theory on ten-dimensional minkowski space gives scattering amplitudes of
physical states. thus what is proposed is the stringy representation for conformal blocks of 2d conformal
eld theories.

in order to see how the ansatz (3.7) works we will focus on the correlators of ln. these are, of course,
rather simple. nevertheless, they contain some technical subtleties. in fact, modulo integrations over zi

7we restrict ourselves to the spherical topology, i.e. tree-level amplitudes. moreover, we drop other matter elds as well

as the ghosts.

the right-hand side is a correlator of the free elds involved in the wakimoto representation of the sl(2)
wess-zumino-witten model. at present there are many ways to compute such correlators [18]. the most
famous ones are the so-called feigin-fuchs and dotsenko-fateev representations. since we do not know any
conjugate representation of ln given by (2.5) with f0 =  1
2 +, it is natural to make use of the feigin-fuchs
representation. for such representation one has a trivial balance of charges for the free elds

# = #

, #i = 0

.

(3.8)

ni (z)  ei(z). the price for this simple balance is an additional number of screening
here i is given by v hi
operators that makes integral representation of conformal blocks more involved than it may be in the
dotsenko-fateev representation with a charge asymmetry due to background charges. thus, we have the
one-point function

h ln ist = ic0

(3.9)

here p means the bose-sea level of the representation of the (, ) algebra. now the balance of charges
gives n = 0 and the leading term in , i.e. 0. thus, the correlator becomes

h ln ist = n,0ic0

dz(cid:28) (z)(cid:29)

.

p

the correlator h ip is zero because of the normal ordering of  8. as a result, we have

h ln ist = 0 .

(3.10)

(3.11)

this means that a vacuum associated to a space-time conformal theory looks like the standard sl(2)
invariant one.

next, let us go on to look at the two-point function

in above we also set + = p2(k  2).

now we come to the analysis of the integrals. obviously, the result depends on p:
(i) for p = 0, the integral over z2 is equal to zero because the corresponding contour may be contracted

to a point. as a result, the correlator vanishes.

(ii) for p > 0 and n > 0, the contour c2 with z1 xed can be deformed as shown in fig.2, so the

integral is given by the residue of the integrand. as a result, we have

thus the central charge is given by c = 6kp, which is in agreement with the result of section 2.

figure 2: deformation of the contour c2.

for p > 0 and n < 0, the integral over z2 equals zero because the contour c2 may be contracted to a

point, so the correlator vanishes.

(iii) for p < 0, the analysis proceeds as in the above. indeed, this is the same as (ii) with   1.
there are two main conclusions:
(a) the proposed ansatz (3.7) together with the corresponding normal ordering prescription reproduces
the standard sl(2) invariant vacuum of space-time conformal eld theory, namely ln|0ist = 0 for n  1.
moreover, it also provides the conjugate vacuum by (iii) with sth0|ln = 0 for n  1. eigenvalues of the
topological charge p have to be restricted to the fundamental region p  0.
(b) there are no corrections to the central charge due to the perturbation term sint. however, it is
expected that this term is relevant for the structure of space-time conformal theory. one example how it
can be realized is known. we mean the deformation of the chiral algebra (w) of 2d gravity coupled to
c  1 matter [19]. recall that such deformation appears due to the expansion over the cosmological term
in the liouville action which is nothing but the screening operator for the virasoro algebra. so, the only
dierence between these cases is the symmetry algebra on the world-sheet: virasoro for 2d gravity and
sl(2) in the case of interest.

it is a straightforward matter of working out the multi-point functions hqi lniist and then deriving the

ward identities. in fact, the latter requires repeating the procedure of 2.

let us conclude this subsection with a remark.
the computations of section 2 are based on zero bose-sea level for the (, ) system. on the other
hand, we have used a non-zero level in this section. so the problem is to see what happens if we use a

10

non-zero level for the computations of section 2, i.e. we should check that the virasoro generators given
by (2.5) are correct. as in section 2, a simple algebra shows that such dened ln obey the virasoro
commutation relations only for f (n) = (n + 1)f0 with f0 = const. thus the denition of ln does not
depend on the bose-sea level of the (, ) system. alternatively, this can be understood as follows. by
using bosonization of the (, ) system, we represent the q-vacuum via the vertex operator at z = 0. it
is well known that a vertex operator sitting at the origin does not aect the commutators of operators
dened via contour integrals surrounding 0.

3.1.4    limit. according to the maldacena conjecture [1], string theory on ads3 times a compact
space is dual to a cft whose world-sheet is the boundary of ads3. first let us clarify what the boundary
is. starting with the metric on ads3

9

ds2 =

l2
r2 (dr2 + dd)

,

(3.17)

the boundary consists of a copy of r2 at r  0, which in the (, , ) coordinates corresponds to   +,
together with a single point at r  , or   . thus, in this representation, the boundary of ads3
is obtained by adding a point at innity to r2, which is nothing but a sphere s2.
one basic question we should ask is how to implement the boundary conditions in the path integral
(3.7). to answer this question, let us recall that the cft/ads correspondence is holographic in sense of
[2, 3]. this means that a quantum theory with gravity must be describable by a boundary theory. it seems
natural therefore to require that stringy vertex operators are independent of . as it is shown in section
2 we cannot dene the generators of virasoro and n = 2 algebras in a -independent way but we can
do so in the case of n = 4 when  drops out.10 thus the holographic principle is in harmony with the
maldacena conjecture that one should get exactly n = 4 on the boundary!

3.1.5 central charge multiplication. given the virasoro algebra with central charge c, it is a simple
thing to build the algebra with a central charge divisible by c, i.e. c = pc, where p is a positive integer.
the actual relation is

then we can write ln in terms of , ,  as

ln =

cp

24(cid:16)1

p2(cid:17)n,0

.

(3.18)

(3.19)

this mechanism actually has the following interesting interpretation. what we had before was a map
: u0  u, i.e. a local embedding of the world-sheet into space-time. now let us dene a covering map
of u on cp1 namely, : u  u(a patch of cp1). if the covering map takes the form  =  p, then
eq.(3.18) is nothing but the consequence of the transformation law of the stress-energy tensor under the
analytic change of coordinates (see [20]). so we can rewrite ln as

ln =

1

p ic0

dz  n+ 1

p  + f (np)n(z) +

cp

24(cid:16)1 

1

p2(cid:17)n,0

.

(3.20)

thus from the geometrical point of view the mechanism gives a short sequence of maps

u0  u  u

that is nothing but a particular case of the greens proposal world-sheets for world-sheets! of course we
can immediately generalize the above mechanism for superalgebras. we will do this in the next subsection.

9we use the euclidean version with radius l.
10we do not know any dierent -independent representation for stringy vertex operators that has been discussed in the

literature on this subject [6, 8-13].

3.2 superalgebras

3.2.1 more sample calculations of space-time correlators. first we want to see the world-sheet conformal
invariance of vertices (2.13). it immediately follows from the fact that their integrands have dimension one
in z. in other words, dening the virasoro generators on the world-sheet as

ln = ic0

dz zn+1(cid:16) +  +    + . . .(cid:17)(z)

,

where the dots mean extra contributions from  and , we simply get that ln commutes with the generators
(2.13). thus we have the stringy representation for the space-time n = 4 superconformal algebra.
now let us give some examples of calculations of space-time correlators. in doing so, for simplicity of
exposition we restrict ourselves to the spherical topology and omit elds other than those used to dene
the n = 4 generators (2.13). note that according to our discussion of the    limit and holographic
principle in subsection 3.1.4,  must be omitted. now ansatz (3.7) is replaced by

ist = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(3.21)

here s0 is the sum of the standard actions for the rst order systems. [d d]p means that the (, ) system
has the bose-sea level p. as regards ni, hi and ji, they are space-time laurent modes, conformal
dimensions and su(2)-spins, respectively. the measures in the path integrals are dened to have the
two-point functions h(z1)(z2)iq = ( z1
, where q is the bose-sea
level. of course, the free action s0 may be perturbed as it was done earlier. one basic question we should
now ask is what sint is. a possible solution is to take the screening operators of sl(2|1) as the perturbation.
fortunately, what saves the day is that the explicit form of sint is irrelevant for what follows.
we will now carry out computations for the n = 4 superalgebra using the above ansatz. let us again

in subsection 3.1.3. so, the string vertices dened in this way lead to the standard ns vacuum of the
space-time cft.

r ist = 0 ,

(3.23)

next, let us go on to look at some two-point functions.
the rst example is h lnlm ist. by using the balance (3.22) and integrating over the free elds, we can

write it as

h lnlm ist = (n2  1) n+m,0

to analyze the integrals we proceed as in subsection 3.1.3. for p > 0 , n > 0 the result is

h lnlm ist =

p
2

(n3  n) n+m,0

,

(3.25)

that gives the central charge c = 6p.

at this point it is natural to make a double check of the above result for c. for this purpose, let us

compute h t 0

n t 0

m ist. all computations proceed as before and result in

n n+m,0

(3.26)

n t 0

h t 0

m ist =

where n, p are positive integers. so, c is again equal to 6p. if instead of h t 0
is h g+

r gs ist, then a simple algebra shows that for p > 0 , r > 1

2

n t 0

m ist the two-point function

h g+
i.e. c = 6p, which is the expected result.

r gs ist = 2p(r2

(3.27)

it is straightforward to nd other two-point functions as well as n-point ones.
3.2.2 the n = 4 case, revisited. up to now our discussion of the n = 4 superconformal algebra has
been somewhat incomplete since the set of the free elds used to build generators (2.13) is not exactly what
one needs to construct the wakimoto free eld representation of the sl(2|1) algebra. so we can say that
the underlying world-sheet algebra may be dierent. let us now ll this gap in our discussion. in doing
so, we need to note just one point: for the particular set of the free elds that we are discussing here, we
can dene the following representation of the ane lie superalgebra sl(2|1) at the level k = 1 11

j +(z) =  (z) ,

j(z) = (z) ,

j 0(z) =

j+(z) =

j +(z) =

j (z) =

(3.28)

after this is done, the generators of n = 4 are immediately written as

dz nj 3 +

n1(j  + j+) (z)

dz nj a (z)

ln = ic0
r = 2iic0

(3.29)

thus sl(2|1) is indeed the underlying world-sheet algebra.
izations of the construction (3.3).

to complete the story, perhaps we should point out that (3.29) can be regarded as one of the general-

3.2.3 ns vebranes. according to the ads/cft correspondence, a cft whose world-sheet is the
boundary of ads3 corresponds to the ir limit of the dynamics of parallel q1 d1-branes and q5 d5-branes
that is mapped under s-duality into q1 fundamental strings and q5 ns5-branes. the central charge of
this boundary cft is given by 6q1q5. one consequence of the construction of strings on ads3 is that
p measures the number of fundamental strings, i.e. p = q1. as to q5, it is identied with the level
of the world-sheet algebra sl(2) [6]. the latter does not seem natural from either the world-sheets for
world-sheets standpoint or from the topological origin of central charges, so it is reasonable to ask how
the situation can be improved. actually, as we have noted at the end of subsection 3.1, there is a nice
way to do this. the intuitive idea is that c  cp. so, if c = 6p then c = 6pp and p is expected to be the
number of ns5-branes. it is easy to see that the c and c generators of the n = 4 superconformal algebra
are related by

ln =

4 conclusions and remarks

first let us say a few words about the results.

in this work we have considered the possible application of postulates (i)-(iii), as these are formulated in
1, to superstring theory on ads3. starting with a formal construction which lifts bosonized ane lie su-
peralgebras on an arbitrary world-sheet to two-dimensional space-time we found rather amusing relations
between space-time n = 2, 4 superconformal algebras and world-sheet superalgebras osp(1|2), sl(2|1).
next following the postulates, we applied this construction to superstring propagation on ads3. we suc-
ceeded in describing the boundary n = 4 algebra in terms of the boundary coordinates only, as postulate
(i) requires, and in interpreting the central charge of this algebra in both primitive and topological ways,
as postulates (ii)-(iii) require. we have also given a prescription for the calculation of space-time correlators.
as an example, we computed the central charge via two-point functions.

let us conclude by mentioning a few open problems together with interesting features of our discussion

of string on ads3.

(i) obviously, the most important open problem is to nd the spectrum of the theory by solving the
corresponding brst problem and establish unitarity 12. unfortunately, it is unknown in general how to do
this. most of the approaches have so far been based on the world-sheet sl(2, r) symmetry algebra and its
wakimoto representation. this may cause new problems because sl(2, r) has no unitary representations
[21]13.

(ii) from the mathematical point of view stringy representations of superconformal algebras are inter-
esting in their own setting. these are not presented in the literature, so further work is needed to develop
both the theory of such representations and their applications to conformal eld theory.

(iii) it is interesting to note that n = 4 is special because it provides the example where both the
holographic principle and unitarity14 are simultaneously present. moreover, postulates (ii)-(iii) can be
tted in with this case. all that provides one more evidence that the ads/cft correspondence should
make sense.

(iv) in our discussion of the world-sheets for world-sheets in section 3 a short sequence of maps
u0  u  u requires one functional integration while the original procedure assumes one integration
12in fact, we know what answer should be namely, the unitary representations of n = 4. so the problem is to give their

stringy representation.

13note that it is possible to catch unitarity by modifying the wakimoto representation as it was done by bars [22].
14at least, the central charge turns out to correspond to the unitary representations.

14

per map. so, it seems more natural to call it the simplied world-sheets for world-sheets rather than the
greens worlds-sheets for world-sheets.

(v) the construction of the stringy representations of superalgebras or, strings on ads3 as a special case,
is strongly reminiscent of the non-critical string theory in sense that both of them have two-dimensional
space-time. however, the dierence is in how the corresponding embedding of the world-sheet is imple-
mented. in the rst case it is done by the rst order systems that is natural from both the geometrical
point of view and as regards the manifest supersymmetry in space-time. as to the second, it is realized
by the scalar elds. nevertheless, these constructions should have relations. some similarities have been
noticed in [23, 24]. however more work is needed to determine a precise relation.

a some ane lie superalgebras and their free eld representations

in this appendix we will briey recall basic facts on some ane lie superalgebras and their free eld
representations. all superalgebras have sl(2, r) as a subalgebra that makes them dierent from what can
usually be found in the literature (see, e.g., [15] and references therein).

a.1 the sl(2, r) case

as a preparation for the discussion of superalgebras in later subsections, let us begin with the ane lie
algebra sl(2).
in the case of sl(2, r) the algebra consists of 3 bosonic currents required to obey the
following operator product expansions

where k is the level, g00 = 1, g+ = g+ = 2, f 0+
it is well-known that the wakimoto free eld representation is described in terms of one free boson 
coupled to a background charge and a rst order bosonic (, ) system of weight (1, 0). the two-point
functions of the free elds are normalized as

0 = 2; a, b, c = 0, +,.

+ = f0

h(z1)(z2)i =  ln z12

h(z1)(z2)i =

the currents are given by

j 0(z) =  +

j +(z) = 2 + + + k(z)

,

with + = p2(k  2).

one can use the sugawara construction, namely

t (z) =

k  2

gabj aj b(z)

,

to determine the virasoro algebra with the central charge c = 3k
k2.

moreover, with the aid of eq.(a.3), t (z) can be written as

t (z) =

finally, let us note that we can write some free elds in terms of the currents

(z) = j(z)

(a.5)

(a.6)

a.2 the osp(1|2) case
the simplest ane superalgebra osp(1|2) is obtained from the algebra sl(2) by incorporating fermionic
currents j(z). thus the op expansions (a.1) are extended to

j a(z1)j b(z2) =

j a(z1)j(z2) =

this time the wakimoto free eld representation is described in terms of one free boson  coupled to
a background charge and a pair of rst order systems (, ) and (, ) of weights (1, 0). the two-point

incorporating fermionic currents j  as well as one bosonic current j 3. we take the dening op expansions

the wakimoto free eld representation is described in terms of a pair of free bosons (, ) without

the purpose of this appendix is to compute the correlator hn(z1)n(z2)iq. there are a variety of ways
to do this. in general the technique of [16] allows us to compute the correlator for any complex n within
the (, ) system with qb = 0. of course, it can be generalized to nonzero qb. however, it seems more
natural to make use of bosonization in this case. if we begin with the bosonization recipe (3.4), then n
will be simply

n(z) = en(i12)(z)

.

on the other hand, for the q-vacuum, the corresponding vertex operator is given by

vq(z) = eia1+b2(z)

, with q = a + b

.

(b.1)

(b.2)

we again use the feigin-fuchs representation where the background charges are taken into account via
screening operators. in general, this technique is rather involved to be used in string theory because it
leads to integral representations of correlators but for the problem at hand it works perfectly (one needs
no screening operators). the correlator is written as

h n(z1)n(z2)iq = h v p ()en(i12)(z1)en(i1+2)(z2)vp(0)i

,

where v p means the conjugate vacuum. a simple algebra gives

h n(z1)n(z2)iq = (cid:16) z2

z1(cid:17)nq

.

(b.3)

(b.4)

to convince the reader, let us give an alternative derivation.

it follows from the denition of the
q-vacuum that hn(z1)n(z2)iq = ( z2
)nqhn(z1)n(z2)i0. the last correlator is an analytic function of
z1 (z2) in the entire complex plane, so it is constant. to nd this constant, note that n(z1)n(z1)  1.
thus we recover the result (b.4).
