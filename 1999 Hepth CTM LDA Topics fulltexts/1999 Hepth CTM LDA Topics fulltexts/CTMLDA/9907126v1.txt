abstract

using the ads/cft correspondence and the eikonal approximation, we evaluate

the elastic parton-parton scattering amplitude at large n and strong coupling g2n in

n=4 sym. we obtain a scattering amplitude with a regge behavior that unitarizes at

large s. for partons with masses m in the range s > m > t, we suggest that our

results may be of relevance to qcd in four dimensions.

elastic quark-quark and gluon-gluon scattering at large s and xed t per-

tains to the domain of non-perturbative qcd. theoretical procedures based on resumming

large classes of perturbative contributions have been proposed [1, 2], partially accounting

for the reggeized form of the scattering amplitude and the phenomenological success of

pomeron/odderon exchange models [2] (and references therein). in an inspiring approach,

nachtmann [3] and others [4, 5] suggested to use non-perturbative techniques for the elas-

tic scattering amplitude.

in the eikonal approximation and to leading order in t/s the

quark-quark amplitude at large s was reduced to a correlation function of two light-like

wilson-lines. the latter was assessed in the stochastic vacuum model [3].

recently, maldacena [6] has made the remarkable conjecture that the large n behav-

ior of some gauge theories may be related to the behavior of string theory in a non-trivial

geometry. this conjecture, made more precise by gubser, klebanov and polyakov [7] and by

witten [8] and extended to non-supersymmetric case by witten [9], provides an interesting

and nonperturbative avenue (via ads/cft correspondence) for studying gauge theories at

large n and strong coupling g2n . in particular the heavy quark potential was found to be

coulombic for supersymmetric theories and linear for non-supersymmetric theories [8, 13].

in this letter we suggest to use the ads/cft approach to analyze the elastic parton-

parton scattering amplitude in the eikonal approximation for n = 4 sym. in section 2 we

briey discuss the salient features of the parton-parton reduced elastic amplitude at large
s. the scattering amplitude in eikonal approximation is reduced to the fourier transform
in section 3 we use the ads/cft
of the connected part of correlators of wilson lines.

approach to calculate the correlator. following [10, 11], we propose that it is given by

the minimum (regularized) area of world sheet whose boundary is the trajectories in the

boundary and give a simple variational method that allows for a closed-form expression for

the minimal area in the presence of a nite proper time cuto. in section 4 we suggest that

for partons with masses s > m > t, the present results may be applicable to qcd

in four dimensions at large n and strong coupling g2n . in section 5 we summarize and

conclude.

2. first consider the quark propagator in an external non-abelian gauge eld. in

the rst quantized theory, the propagator from x to y in euclidean space reads

s(x, y; a) = dx|

(2)

where pc,s are orderings over color and spin matrices, and  = [, ]/2. the rst

exponent in the path integral is an arbitrary wilson line in the fundamental representation

of su(n)c, and the second exponent is a string of innitesimal thomas-precessions along

the wilson line. the integration is over all paths with x(0) = x and x(t ) = y. notice that
from the proper time integral, the dominant contributions come from t  1/m. heavy
quarks travel shorter in proper time than light quarks and the mass gives an eective cuto

of the proper time range. this observation will be important below.

a quark with large momentum p travels on a straight line with 4-velocity x = v = p/m
(for m 6= 0) and v2 = 1. throughout, we will distinguish between the 4-velocity v and the
instantaneous velocity v = dx/dt = p/e  1. for a straight trajectory, the 4-acceleration
x = a = 0 and the spin factor drops. this is the eikonal approximation for s in which

an ordinary quark transmutes to a scalar quark. the present argument applies to any

charged particle in a background gluon eld, irrespective of its spin or helicity. the only

amendments are: for antiquarks the 4-velocity v is reversed in the wilson line, while for

gluons the wilson lines are in the adjoint representation. with this in mind, quark-quark

scattering can be also extended to quark-antiquark, gluon-gluon or scalar-scalar scattering.
we note that for quark-antiquark scattering the elastic amplitude dominates at large s
since the annihilation part is down by pt/s.

generically, we will refer to elastic parton-parton scattering as

qa(p1) + qb(p2)  qc(k1) + qd(k2)

(3)

with s = (p1 + p2)2, t = (p1  k1)2, s + t + u = 4m2. we denote by ab and cd respectively,
the incoming and outgoing color and spin of the quarks (polarization for gluons). using the
eikonal form (1) and lsz reduction, the scattering amplitude t may be reduced to [3, 4, 5]

tab,cd(s, t)  2isz d2b eiqbd (w1(b)  1)ac (w2(0)  1)bde

where

w1,2(z) = pcexp(cid:18)igz +

cm frame p1  (e, e, 0), p2  (e,e, 0), q = p1  k1  (0, 0, q) and s  4e2. the

3

averaging in (4) is over the gauge congurations using the qcd action. the total cross

section for s >> t > 0 follows from (4) in the form  = im t /s < ln2s, where the last

inequality is just the froissart bound.

the amplitude (4) allows for two gauge-invariant decompositions (repeated indices

are summed over)

t1 = tab,ab

t2 = tab,ba

(6)

assuming that the gluon-gauge elds are periodic at the end-points. this can be achieved
strongly by requiring periodicity on the hypersurface of constant proper time  or weakly
by identifying the end-points, e.g. xa = (,, b) = xb = (+, +, b). these condi-
tions introduce a natural compactication of m4. for gluon-gluon scattering the lines are

doubled in color space (i.e., adjoint representation) and several gauge-invariant contractions
are possible. for quark-quark scattering the singlet exchange in t-channel is 0+ (pomeron)

while for quark-antiquark it is 0 (odderon) as the two dier by charge conjugation.

3.

in the eikonal approximation the parton-parton scattering amplitude is related

to an appropriate correlator of two light-like wilson lines. the typical duration in proper
time of these light-like lines is t  1/m as we noted above. we now suggest to analyze
the gauge-invariant correlators using the ads/cft [6, 8] approach for n=4 sym. this
correlator in large n and strong coupling g2n regime can be obtained from the minimal

surface in the ve-dimensional ads space, [6, 11, 8] tracing the light-like wilson lines at its

boundaries as shown in fig. 1. the classical action for a string world-sheet is

s =

where r = (2g2

y m is the radius of the ads space. the ads space
has a boundary in minkowski space m4 at z = 0. the boundary condition on the string

world-sheet is given by the two time-like trajectories

x = v t = v, y = 0, z = 0; and x = v t, y = b, z = 0

(9)

with v = v/ and t is the real time. the minimal surface associated to (7-9) leads to a set

of coupled partial dierential equations, which we have not yet managed to solve exactly.

instead, we provide a variational estimate as we now explain.

first, we divide the string world-sheet by constant time slices, each containing a string

connected to two boundary points. then we minimize the string length and integrate over

it to get an approximate minimal area. specically, we choose an orthogonal coordinate
system on the world-sheet, and dene the area a through s = r2

be the length of the string ending on the two receding quarks at the boundary with

separation l(t). l(t) depends on t only through l(t)(= l( )), so that l(t) and l( ) represent

the same quantity. first, we minimize this length and then form the area by adding up

the areas of strips between the hyper-planes of time t and t + dt. the height of the strip at

the boundary is dt1  v 2 = d where  is the proper time at the boundary. the height of
strip at the central point of the string is given by dtq1  z0(t)2 where z0(t) is the maximum

value of z at the time slice t. therefore by the trapezoidal rule,

where l(t) = b2 + 4v2 2, with v = v t is the separation between the two time-like

identical to the problem of nding a static q q potential [10, 11]. the result for a properly

regularized length is

where  is an infrared regulator (t = 1/). #1 equation (18) is our main result. it is

important to realize that had we used time instead of proper time, the outcome would have

been independent of s. the proper time description and its ensuing cuto is pressed upon

us by both the underlying string dynamics and the eikonal representation following from

(1-2). since the elastic amplitude involves typically momenta of order t, we expect the
impact parameter in (18) to be b  1/t. as a result, the crossing singularity of the two

wilson loops at b = 0 is dynamically regulated.

this result is remarkable. the amplitude is nonperturbative in g2n and it is dierent from
the bfkl result [1, 2] especially in the presence of 1/s in the exponent. also, it shows
that the elastic parton-parton scattering amplitude in n=4 sym with a nite proper time
cuto t  1/m reggeizes and unitarizes at large s. one should notice that in large s limit,
the exponent has a nite piece since /v = 1/v  1. however, this piece is imaginary
in high energy as indicated in eq.(20), which assures the unitarity. the regge intercept

is (s). the appearance of the mass m is the natural infrared cuto in the problem. for

quarks and gluons, it is simply their constituent mass.

the regge behavior signals the occurrence of log s-dependence in the elastic ampli-

tude, a behavior usually expected in asymptotically free and non-conformal gauge theories.

how could this property be present for n=4 sym with conformal symmetry? in fact the

appearance of the string picture in the n=4 sym was a much appreciated surprise in mal-

dacenas result [6]. in our case, the regge behavior follows from the the stringy behavior

of n=4 sym in the large n limit. also, conformal symmetry is upset in the presence of a

nite proper time cuto t  1/m. the receding partons with momenta s denes a range

in rapidity space of the order of ln s. powers of ln s count the number of gluons exchanged

in the t-channel. since (20) can be written as power series of ln s, it contains terms of

innite number of gluon exchange. a similar observation was also made by verlinde and

verlinde [4] in the process of mapping high-energy scattering onto a conformally symmetric

two-dimensional sigma model.

4. we now suggest that for intermediate quark masses m such that s > m > t

the result (??) maybe of relevance to qcd in four dimensions. indeed, the gauge-invariant
forms t1,2 suggest a compactication of m4 in the time-direction (weak-form). on the
surface of constant t the gluons (gluinos) satisfy periodic (antiperiodic) boundary condi-
tions. for nite t these conditions discriminate between particles and their supersymmetric
partners. for xed but large t  1/m (arbitrarily small m), we expect the breaking of
supersymmetry to be small, and it can be treated by a small perturbation from the ads

metric, possibly in the form of a light black-hole in the ads space. to the leading order

the calculation can be done with the ads metric. and this is result of the previous section.

for nite t , similar calculations can be done by changing the background metric from the

8

ads to the a ads black-hole:

ds2 = r2f dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dw2 + (1/f )dz2

z2

.

(22)

with f = 1(z)4. in our case, the scale  will be interpreted as a proper-time cuto instead
of temperature. by choosing periodic boundary conditions for the gluons, and antiperiodic
boundary conditions for the gluinos, the latters acquire masses of order 1/t  m   > t

and decouple from t-channel exchange. if we assess the length l( ) in the presence of the

black hole as a function of the separation l( ), the outcome is more like a screened coulomb

potential [14, 12]. from (16), we note that the logarithmic contribution is coming from a

large separation l(t) or large t ( ) for nite impact parameter b. however, for very small
impact parameter b << s/m2, we get log dependence from both large and small time
regions. since we are integrating over 0 < b < , which of course contains the small b
region, we still get the logs dependence for very small impact parameters. therefore we

expect that the regge behavior survives under susy breaking and the main feature of our

result should also hold for the real qcd. more detailed analysis will be given elsewhere.

finally, the present arguments also show that at large n and strong g2n , the cross

sections for quark-quark and quark-antiquark scattering are the same. the gluon-gluon
scattering amplitude could be calculated similarly with the substitution n  n 2, due to
the adjoint representation of the gluon.

5. we have presented arguments for evaluating the elastic parton-parton scattering
amplitude at large n and strong g2n in n=4 sym. although the latter is conformally

invariant in m4 the appearance of the string picture and the necessity to regulate the
elastic contribution by a nite proper time t  1/m has led to a regge-like behavior that
unitarizes at large s. the result cannot be arrived at by perturbation theory. the nature
of the result depends sensitively on the string character of the underlying description and

hence not applicable to abelian-like theories such as qed.

our main result follows from a physically motivated variational estimate of the min-

imal surface in the ads space. the exact form of the extremal surface is too involved to

be written down analytically. although an exact result would of course be ideal, we do not

expect our estimate of the parton-parton cross section to change appreciably. indeed, the

dominant contributions arise from scattering with large impact parameter b  1/t, for

which our approximation for the extremal surface should be legitimate. for a large impact

9

parameter b, the extremal surface is smoothly twisted and eikonal approximation is also

good.

we have suggested that for partons with masses m in the range s < m < t, the

present results may be applicable to qcd at large n and strong g2n . another and perhaps

complementary way to see this is to note that large n qcd reduces to a master eld de-

scription [16]. the latter may be regarded as the starting point in maldacena [6] conjecture

leading to the ads metric. from a dierent point of view, verlinde and verlinde [4] have

shown that at large s the elastic amplitudes in qcd follows from a conformally symmetric

two-dimensional sigma model, where the conformal symmetry is precisely broken when the

light-like quark lines are regulated in the time-like directions. could it be that in large n

the eective action derived by verlinde and verlinde [4] map onto an ads type action?
