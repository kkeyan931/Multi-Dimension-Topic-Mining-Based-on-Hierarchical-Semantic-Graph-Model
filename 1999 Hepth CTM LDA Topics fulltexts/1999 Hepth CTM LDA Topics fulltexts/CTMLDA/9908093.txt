however, coarse-graining (averaging) content (say mat- ter distribution) commute averaging geometry, mainly due nonlinearity curvature tensor (see example  references therein detailed discussion issue). worse still, coarse-graining neither two quantities would general commute coarse-graining caustics. example, single bh given mass produce innite number caustics; clear cut-o mass lens general

light surfaces taken end caustics. put forward modied proposal drastically simplies structure light surfaces. so, note important distinguish carefully pb, boundary past 2surface b starts b converging null geodesics, light sheet ls suggested bousso. former subset latter; boundary pb ends rst self-intersections null sheets orthogonal b, usually non-local intersections, whereas light sheet ends caustics, local self-intersections. region self-intersections complex connectivity occurs. therefore makes sense separate part light surface part boundary past b. shall call inner light sheet (ils) refer rest ls, i.e. part null surface b also null boundary past b, outer light sheet (ols). ils encodes detailed information strong lensing occurs null surface, bounds region self-intersection caustics. number topology components depends lensing objects hence reects degree strong density inhomogeneity. however, weak inhomogeneities cause strong lensing encoded ils. thus inner light sheet produces enormous complexity light sheets proposed bousso. additionally, continuing null surface beyond rst self-intersections caustics actually result multiple coverings part interior b null surfaces, turned themselves. thus including part results excess area counted, much complex projection data onto null boundary necessary setting holographic principle. purpose, necessary include data outer light surface ols; data ils redundant, already counted ols. therefore propose modied version boussos proposal thus: proposal: let four-dimensional spacetime satises einsteins equations dominant

measured direction away b, non-positive everywhere, ending boundary past b. let total entropy contained l. a/4. hypersurface l properties outer light surface ols. important feature modied proposal cuts ils, together caustics fractal boundaries arising them, therefore much simpler light sheet structure. also covers regions interior b once. therefore suggest that, case realistic inhomogeneous cosmologies, better surface choose holographic principle associated entropy conjecture. 5.1 nature light sheets modied proposal begin let us note modied covariant entropy conjecture proposed leaves

structure light surface. despite this, number dicult points still remain. firstly, even though caustics removed formulation, non-continuity generators boundary past b still remain self-intersections, make ols surface non-dierentiable there. however simple smoothing regions outer surface self-intersections deal adequately cases, area smoothed surface arbitrarily close real surface. smoothing cannot done, new eects may occur careful analysis required. secondly, since caustics locally determined, end points ls boussos proposal denable locally - least principle. proposal relies determi- nation null

6 conclusion taken closer look applications holography principle cosmology particular proposal recently put forward bousso. argued real inhomogeneous universe, light surfaces dened way order satisfy
