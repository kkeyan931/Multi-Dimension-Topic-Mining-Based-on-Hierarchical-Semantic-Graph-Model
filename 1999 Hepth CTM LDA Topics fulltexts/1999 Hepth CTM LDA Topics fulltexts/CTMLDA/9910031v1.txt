abstract

we suggest that orbifold eld theories which are obtained from

non-commutative n = 4 sym are nite. in particular, non-supersymmetric
orbifold truncations might be nite even at nite values of nc.

1 introduction

recently non-commutative yang-mills theory [1] attracted a lot of attention,
mainly due to discoveries of new connections to string theory[2, 3, 4]. in a
recent paper[5], it was suggested that the divergences of the non-commutative
yang-mills theory are dictated by the large nc limit of the theory. namely,
that divergences occur only in planar diagrams (the observation that the
planar commutative and non-commutative theories are the same up to phases
in the green functions, was already made in[6]. a careful analysis of the
divergences was carried out in ref.[7]).

another direction of research is the study of orbifold eld theories - mo-
tivated by the ads/cft correspondence [8]. it was conjectured by kachru
and silverstein [9] that orbifolds of ads5  s 5 which act on the s 5 part de-
ne a large nc nite theory, even when the r-symmetry is completely broken
and the theory is not supersymmetric. this conjecture was later proven using
both eld theory [10] and string theory [11] techniques.

in this note we would like to consider non-commutative yang-mills theo-
ries which are obtained by an orbifold truncation of n = 4 sym. we suggest
that these theories are nite, namely that there are no divergent feynman
diagrams, even when the theory under consideration is non-supersymmetric
and the number of colors is nite.

2 orbifold eld theories

orbifold eld theories are obtained by a certain truncation of a supersym-
metric yang-mills theory. let us consider the special case of n = 4 . the
truncation procedure is as follows: consider a discrete subgroup  of the
n = 4 r-symmetry group su(4). for each element of the orbifold group, a
representation  inside su(||nc) should be specied. each eld  transform
as   r, where r is a representation matrix inside the r-symmetry
group. the truncation is achieved by keeping invariant elds. the resulting
theory has a reduced amount of supersymmetry, or no supersymmetry at all.
it was conjectured[9], based on the ads/cft conjecture, that the truncated
large nc theories are nite as the parent n = 4 theory. later it was proved
[10] that the planar diagrams of the truncated theory and parent theories are
identical. in particular it means that the perturbative beta function of the

1

large nc daughter theory is zero and that the theory is nite.

in the cases of n = 2 truncations, there is only one-loop (perturbative)
contribution to the beta function. its vanishing indicates the perturbative
niteness of the daughter theory at nite nc as well.

in n = 1 truncations the situation is more subtle. indeed, the theory is
nite at nite values of nc, but the niteness is due to leigh-strassler type
of arguments[12]. in that case one should consider the su(nc) version of the
theory (and not the u(nc) theory which is obtained from the string theory
orbifold), since the u(1) beta function is always positive at the origin. in
addition 1
n 2

shifts of the yukawa couplings are needed[13].

c

in the non-supersymmetric case there are no known examples of nite
theories at nite nc, though attempts in this direction using orbolds were
recently made[14]. as we shall see, due to non-commutativity such examples
can be found.

3 perturbative behavior of non-commutative

yang-mills theories

recently, several authors[7, 5] analyzed the renormalization behavior of non-
commutative yang-mills theories (for an earlier discussion see[6]. related
works are [15, 16]). we briey review their analysis. the feynman rules of
the commutative and non-commutative theories in momentum space are very
similar. in fact the only dierence is that each vertex of the non-commutative
theory acquires a phase, exp iijki  kj (the moyal phase), with respect to
the vertex of ordinary commutative theory[6]. for planar diagrams, this
phase cancels at internal loops and the only remnant is an overall phase.
therefore the planar commutative and non-commutative theories are similar,
in accordance with recent ndings[17, 18, 19].

another claim[5, 7] is that the oscillations of the moyal phases at high mo-
mentum would regulate non-planar diagrams, namely that uv divergences
of non-planar diagrams would disappear. there are two exceptional cases in
which non-planar diagrams will still diverge[7]: (i). when the non-planar di-
agrams consist of planar sub-diagrams which might diverge. (ii). for specic
values of momentum (a zero measure set) the moyal phase can be zero. the
later type of innities should disappear in the non-compact limit[5]. if true,

it means that truly divergences in the non-commutative theory occur only in
planar graphs.

4 finiteness of non-commutative orbifold eld

theories

let us now consider an orbifold truncation of non-commutative n = 4 sym.
these theories can be dened perturbatively by a set of feynman rules.
the natural denition would be to attach to each vertex the corresponding
moyal phase[6]. according to ref.[5], the only potential divergences are the
ones which arise in planar diagrams. non-planar diagrams are expected to
be nite (up to exceptions which were mentioned in the previous section).
moreover, according to the analysis of [10], the planar diagrams of an orbifold
theory can be evaluated by using the corresponding diagrams of the parent
non-commutative n = 4 . these diagrams are nite since they dier from the
commutative n = 4 only by an overall phase. in this way sub-divergences of
non-planar diagrams will also be canceled. we therefore conclude that any
orbifold truncation of non-commutative non-compact n = 4 sym is nite.
in particular, it means that we might have a rich class of non-supersymmetric
gauge theories which are nite, even at nite nc (in contrast to ordinary non-
supersymmetric orbifold eld theories, where the two loop beta function is
generically non-zero). note that though these theories might be nite, they
are certainly not conformal.

examples of non-susy orbifold gauge theories are given in refs.[9, 20]. it
might be interesting to understand how the niteness of these theories arise
from string theory orbifolds.
