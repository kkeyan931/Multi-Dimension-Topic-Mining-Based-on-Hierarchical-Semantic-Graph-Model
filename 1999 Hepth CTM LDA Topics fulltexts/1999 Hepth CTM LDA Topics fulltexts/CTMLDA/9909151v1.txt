a discrete eld formalism exposes the physical meaning and origins of gauge elds,
their symmetries and singularities. they represent a lack of a stricter eld-source co-
herence.

pacs numbers: 03.50.de

we want to discuss here the physical meaning and the origins of gauge eld symmetries and singularities.

it is well known that gauge freedom seems to be a consequence of the eld anti-symmetry but what

makes anti-symmetric all fundamental interaction elds? in general relativity the potential, but not

the eld is described by a symmetric tensor. in this work we discuss the physical interpretation of a

discrete point-like eld introduced through a new integral transform of the potential eld in order to

show that its gauge symmetry and singularity are consequences of causality and lorentz invariance and

that they reect a loss of eld-source coherence. the discrete elds are proposed to be associated to

the eld quanta as they are their closest description possible in a classical theory. with discrete elds

eld theory loses its ubiquitous problems with innities.

causality: local and extended

any given pair of events on minkowski spacetime denes a four-vector x. if this x is connected to

the propagation of a free physical object (a signal, a particle, a eld, etc) it is constrained to satisfy

 2 = x2,

(1)

where  is a real-valued parameter. we use the metric  = diag(1, 1, 1, 1). so, (1) just expresses

that x cannot be spacelike. a physical object does not propagate over a spacelike x. this is local

causality. geometrically it is the denition of a three-dimensional double cone; x is the four-vector

separation between a generic event x  (~x, t) and the cone vertex. this conic hypersurface, in eld

theory, is the free-eld support: a free eld cannot be inside nor outside but only on the cone. the

cone-aperture angle  is given by tan  = |~x|/|t|, c = 1, or equivalently,  2 = (t)2(1  tan2 ). a

supported by capes/coplag-es

1

change of the supporting cone corresponds to a change of speed of propagation and is an indication of

interaction. special relativity restricts  to the range 0    /4, which corresponds to a restriction

on  : 0  | |  |t|. the lightcone ( = /4, or | | = 0) and the t-axis in the object rest-frame

( = 0, or | | = |t|) are the extremal cases. we want to work however with a more restrictive

constraint:

 + f.x = 0,

(2)

where f is dened by f  = dx/d , a constant four-vector tangent to the cone; it is timelike (f 2 = 1)

if  6= 0, or lightlike (f 2 = 0 in the limit) if  = 0.

the equation (2) denes a hyperplane tangent to the cone (1). together, (1) and (2) dene a cone

generator f , tangent to f . a xed four-vector f  at a point represents a bre in the spacetime, a

straight line tangent to f , the f -generator of the local cone (1).

extended causality is the imposition of both (1) and (2) to the propagation of any point-like physical

object. geometrically, it is a requirement that the object remains on the cone generator f .

the lightcone is the support for the propagation of a massless eld; the eld itself and its theory are

dened over the lightcone. with extended causality we have to consider not the lightcone but its

generators and to dene a eld with support on a generic bre f , a (1 + 1)-manifold embedded on a

(3 + 1)-minkowski spacetime. it is a discrete eld af (x,  ) which is related to the standard continuous

eld a(x,  ) through an integral transform to be introduced later. as a consequence of the causality

constraint (2), the elds must be explicit functions of x and of , where  , is a supposedly known

function of x, a solution of (1):  = 0 p(x)2. we have from (2) that

f = 


x .

(3)

for a massless eld, as it propagates without a change on its proper time,  = 0,  is actually the

instantaneous proper-time of its source at the event of its emission. well-known examples of this are

the li`enard-wiechert solutions [37], discussed in this context in [1].

causality and dynamics

the constraint (2) has a very important dynamical content as we discuss now. for a massless eld

emitted by a point charge on a worldline z( ), parameterized by its proper-time  ,  = 0 and

x = x  z( ). the restriction (2) is then reduced to f.(x  z( )) = 0 and this implies that the event

x, where the eld is being observed, and the charge retarded position z( ) must belong to a same null

line f . it is not necessary to explicitly distinguish a generic  from a  at a retarded position, as the

2

situations considered in this note always refer to the last one. more information can be extracted from

this constraint as f.(x  z)(cid:12)(cid:12)f = 0 implies, with (3), on
f.v(cid:12)(cid:12)f = 1,

(4)

where v = dz/d . this relation may be seen as a covariant normalization to 1 of the time component

of f in the source rest-frame at its retarded time, f 4(cid:12)(cid:12) f

with a = dv /d we get from (4) the following most important relationship

~v =0

= | ~f |(cid:12)(cid:12) f

~v =0

= 1. with a further derivation and

a.f(cid:12)(cid:12)f = 0,

(5)

between the direction f along which the signal is emitted (absorbed) and the instantaneous change in

the charge state of motion at the retarded (advanced) time. (5) is a causal constraint on the propagation

of any eld, regardless its tensorial nature, which we did not specify yet. it implies that a4 = (~a. ~f /f4)(cid:12)(cid:12)f ,
whereas a.v  0 leads to a4 = (~a.~v /v4)(cid:12)(cid:12)f , and so we have that in the charge instantaneous rest frame
at the emission time ~a and ~f are orthogonal vectors, ~a. ~f(cid:12)(cid:12) f

= 0.

~v =0

field equations

(1) implies that  is a function of x whereas (2) implies on (3). then the derivatives of af (x,  ), allowed

by the constraint (2), are the directional derivatives along f, which with the use of (3) we write as

a(x,  )(cid:12)(cid:12)f = (


x +


x




)a(x,  )(cid:12)(cid:12)f = (cid:0)


x  f



(cid:1)af  af .

with  replacing  for taking care of the constraint (2), the propertime  can be treated as a fth

independent coordinate. we adopt this geometrical approach. the eld equation for a massless discrete

eld is

  af (x,  ) = j(x,  ),

(6)

or, explicitly (  2f )af = j, as f 2 = 0. j is its source. the f -wave equation (6) can be solved
by an f-greens function, af (x, x) = r d4ydy gf (x  y, x  y) j(y), where the sub-indices specify
the respective events x and y, and gf (x  y, x  y) being a solution of  gf (x  y, x  y) =

4(x  y)(x  y) := 5(x  y). this equation has [2]:

gf (x,  ) =

1
2

(b f .x)(b )( + f.x) =

1
2

(bf 4t)(b )( + f.x),

(7)

as a solution, where b = 1, and (x) is the heaviside function, (x  0) = 1 and (x < 0) = 0. gf (x,  )

does not depend on ~xt, where the subscript t stands for transversity with respect to ~f : ~f .~xt = 0. this

3

justies this approach of working with discrete eld; its propagation does not depend on ~xt, or more

explicitly, on the parts of spacetime that are not in f . two distinct elds emitted by two neighbouring

point-sources do not see each other; each one of them can be treated as an independent single entity. it

implies also, as it will be shown later, that the energy-momentum content of af is everywhere conserved.

this strongly suggests seeing af as the fundamental eld, a classical description of the quanta of the

eld a.

for f  = ( ~f , f 4), f is dened by f  = ( ~f , f 4); f and f are two opposing generators of a same

lightcone; they are associated, respectively, to the b = +1 and to the b = 1 solutions and, therefore,

to the processes of creation and annihilation of a discrete eld af . (b f .x) = (bt). for b = +1 or

t > 0, gf (x,  ) describes a point signal emitted by the charge at ret = 0, and that has propagated to x

along the bre f, of the future lightcone of z(ret); for b = 1 or t < 0, gf (x,  ) describes a point signal

that is propagating along the bre f of the future lightcone of x towards the point z(adv) where it will

be absorbed (annihilated) by the charge. observe the dierences from the standard interpretation of

the li`enard-wiechert solutions with local causality. there is no advanced, causality violating solution

here. j is the source of the f solution and a sink for the f solution. these two solutions correspond to

creation and annihilation of af . gf and its properties will be discussed in more details in [2].

discrete elds

in a generic way an extended source is a set, continuous or discrete, of point sources and, according to

(7), each one of them may generate its independent af eld. but the essence of this discrete formalism is

that elds and sources are discrete, point-like; this might be taken as an extra assumption but actually

any extended object, as far as our technology can tell, is made of point-like objects. the proton

structure is a good illustration of what we mean; it is an extended object but actually made of points:

quarks and gluons. the image of a continuous extended object is just a macroscopic approximation, an

average output of our senses or measuring apparatus. thus let us now apply this f formalism to the

eld generated by a point scalar charge. just for the sake of simplicity we will x a and af as vector

elds like the four-vector potential in maxwell theory, but we will take eq. (6) as our departure point

for studying the eld, assuming that we dont know anything else about it.

with  being treated as an independent fth parameter, a denition of a four-vector current must

carry an additional constraint expressing the causal relationship between two events y and z. its four-

vector current is given by j (y, y = z) = ev (z)3(~y  ~z)(ty  tz), where z(z), is the electron

worldline parameterized by its proper-time z. in this denition of j, y has to be equal to z as a

consequence of the dirac deltas and of (1). for b = +1, that is, for the eld emitted by j we have

4

af (x, x) = 2er d5ygf (x  y)v (y)3(~x  ~y)(tx  ty), where the factor 2 accounts for a change of

normalization as we are now excluding the annihilated af (the future lightcone). then,

af (x, x) = ev (z)(tx  tz)(x  z)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=x+f.(xz).

(8)

to the standard continuous eld a(x,  ) one can add arbitrary solution from its homogeneous equation;

this is compatible with its gauge freedom and it may indeed be necessary for attending some specic

boundary conditions. for af this is not so; it describes interactions between point objects for which

boundary conditions have no meaning. this is not possible for af because the solution to its homo-

geneous equation is just ( + f.x), which is trivial in the sense that ( + f.x)  0. besides it is a

distribution, in contradistinction to (8) which is a nite point-like eld; so it cannot be used to redene

af . this constant solution should not be added to (5) in anyway because it would articially intro-

duce innities where there is none and could destroy the theory consistency. so, the eld af is given,

essentially, by the charge times its four-velocity at its retarded time. for a massless eld x = z and

f.(x  z) = 0. (t) and ( ) do not contribute to af , except at x = z( ), as a further consequence

of the eld constraints [2]. thus for  = 0 and t > 0 we write just  a

therefore af is a divergenceless eld,

f = (ev )(cid:12)(cid:12)f = efa(cid:12)(cid:12)f .

.af = 0,

(9)

as a direct consequence of (5). this is a very important point and deserves further elaboration. there

is a causal link, a coherence, between af and its source that leads necessarily to (9). this link does

not depend on the eld tensorial nature. the extended causality constraint, i.e. the explicit constraints

on a causal propagation of a point object, whichever be it, leads to the constraint (5) between its

direction of propagation f and the change in the state of motion of its source (sink) at the emission

(absorption) time. for the same reason .j = 0. we have charge conservation regardless the maxwell

tensor antisymmetry which supposedly we still dont know. therefore charge conservation is also a

consequence of (extended) causality and not of gauge symmetry, which we do not have yet.

af of (8) is just an expression of the charge state of motion at the emission time. state of motion

is a relative or frame dependent concept and this suits well with af being a potential; the proper eld,

the force carrier, is then associated to the charge acceleration, an absolute concept. we have started

from eq. (6) assuming that we dont know anything about the eld except that it is massless and must

somehow be associated to the gradient of af and, therefore, to the components of a second-rank (in

the case of af being a vector eld) tensor f 

f  a

acceleration of its source at its emission time and f . therefore, ff could in principle be a scalar or

f = ef a(cid:12)(cid:12)f , dened by two four-vectors, the

5

either a symmetric or an antisymmetric tensor. but a and f are not independent as they are constrained

by (5), which besides excluding the scalar component requires that ~a. ~f = 0, in the charge instantaneous

rest-frame and this, as we show now, excludes the symmetric component.

in other words, ff is a

function not of a but of at:

ff(cid:12)(cid:12)~v =0  ef at(cid:12)(cid:12)f = ef (a  f

~a. ~f
f 2
4

)(cid:12)(cid:12)f ,

(10)

as at := a  f ~a. ~f
f 2
the electron instantaneous acceleration; af is a transversal eld. but f f ~a. ~f
f 2

.

4

in this particular frame the direction of propagation of af is perpendicular to

is not lorentz covariant

4

(neither at) and there should be no privileged frame; so it should not appear in the ff denition.

lorentz covariance requires an anti-symmetric f f

 := e(fa  fa)(cid:12)(cid:12)f . thus,

f f
 := af

  af
.

(11)

that ff must be an antisymmetric tensor is a direct consequence of lorentz covariance and of (5); it

cannot be proved in a context of local causality.

observe that initially with just the eld equation (6) we had no ground to talk about gauge freedom but

even now after knowing that af is just a potential and that the physical eld ff must be antisymmetric

there is still no gauge freedom, not even a residual one. af , despite the antisymmetry of ff , is deter-

mined by the state of motion of its source. the link between af and the state of motion of its source

(a single point charge) does not allow any non-trivial gauge freedom. extended causality incorporates

into the background geometry the constraints that, in an explicitly covariant way, eliminate the eld

spurious degrees of freedom.

having ff we can get its energy-momentum tensor. after (11) and (9) it is given by 

f =

f 
f f 

f   

4 f 

f f f

 = e2f f a2|f and satises 

f = 0. the energy-momentum con-

tent of af is everywhere conserved; f is nite and represents a point object changelessly propagating

along f : a classical photon. all that we have used, besides the wave equation (6), is causality and

lorentz covariance. therefore we conclude that causality and lorentz covariance leads to, lets say,

maxwells theory on a bre f  with a xed lorentz gauge.

from discrete to continuous elds

now we discuss the connection between this maxwells theory on f  and the maxwells theory, between

the eld ff and the f that we measure in a laboratory. we can say, guratively, that the lightcone

is the union of all its generators. in a similar way the standard continuous eld a(x,  ) represents the

6

collection of all a(x,  )f from all possible bres f. in such a picture af is the intersection of a(x,  )

with the bre f :

a(x,  )f = a(x,  )(cid:12)(cid:12)f ,

(12)

it is the restriction of a(x,  ) to f. it represents an element of a(x,  ), the part of it contained in the

bre f : a point propagating along f. the converse of (12) is given by

a(x,  ) =

1

2 z d4f (f 2)a(x,  )f ,

(13)

where d4f = df4 | ~f |2 d| ~f | d2f and (f 2)  1/(2| ~f|) {(f 4  | ~f |) + (f 4 + | ~f |)}. for the emitted
(f 4 = | ~f |) eld in the source instantaneous rest frame at the emission time (f 4 = 1) the equation (13)

can be written as

a(x,  ) =

1

4 z d2f a(x,  )f ,

(14)

where the integral represents the sum over all directions of ~f on a lightcone. 4, we see, is a normalization
factor and (14) is a particular case of a(x,  ) = (rf

d2f a(x,  )f )/(rf

d2f ). (operationally f is

dened by the asperture of our measuring apparatus.) on the other hand an integration over the

f degrees of freedom in (6) and (11) with the use of (14) reproduces, respectively, the usual wave

equation and the maxwell eld of the standard formalism, as r d2f f  af (x) = 0 because af (x)

is an even function of f . observe that the missing 4 in (6) re-appears in (14). for the potential (8)

and the greens function (7) this integration produces respectively the li`enard-wiechert solution and

its standard greens function, g(x,  ) = 1/r (bt)(r  bt). retrieving the li`enard-wiechert solutions

could hardly be a surprise as we are summing up elds that satisfy the lorentz gauge. a remarkable

point is that af and gf have no singularity in contradistinction to their continuous counterparts. this

is a consequence of their distinct supports; a straight line and a lightcone, respectively. so, contrary

to an old lore, the coulomb (and also the schwarszchild, see [8]) singularity is not a consequence of a

point-like source but just a reex of the lightcone vertex [9]. the eld singularity appears with (13),

the integration over the lightcone.

another remarkable point is the surging of gauge symmetry in the continuous eld; even the li`enard-

wiechert solution, the transform of (8), acquires a residual gauge freedom. in g, a and f all information

implicit with each f is lost with the f -integration. a generic solution a is only indirectly linked to the

state of motion of its sources; it can have many sources at once, even a continuous one or no source at all

(solutions from homogeneous equation). in other words, with the f -integration the eld af becomes a,

7

loses the strict constraint (5) of extended causality and acquires gauge freedom. the coherence between

af and its source at its emission time (expressed through f as a one-to-one link between a eld-event

and a source-event) is lost. with a(x) the bre f is replaced by the lightcone and a point-charge event

is linked to an innity of eld events. this is saying again that the innity in a is introduced with (14).

in this sense a(x) represents more a kind of averaging (smearing) than a union of af

s. this explains

the violation of causality in the li`enard-wiechert advanced solution and the causality problems with

the lorentz-dirac equation. solutions with other (non-covariant) gauges just aggravates this loss.

this work has thrown some light on the meaning and origin of gauge elds, their symmetries and

singularities. details and extended discussions on the physical interpretation, on the connections to

classical and quantum physics and to experimental data are left for a coming work [2]. there are of

course many other questions still to be answered; a classical scheme cannot give the complete answer.

it is necessary now to distinguish what is just a consequence of the simple description adopted for the

eld sources from what requires a real quantum treatment. how far can we go with such a classical

scheme or where a legitimate quantum input must necessarily be added?
