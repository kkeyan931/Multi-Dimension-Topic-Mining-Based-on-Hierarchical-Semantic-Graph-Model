abstract

we couple n copies of n = (2, 0) scalar multiplets to a gauged n = (2, 0) supergravity in
2 + 1 dimensions which admits ads3 as a vacuum. the scalar elds are charged under the
gauged r-symmetry group u (1) and parametrize certain kahler manifolds with compact or non-
compact isometries. the radii of these manifolds are quantized in the compact case, but arbitrary
otherwise.
in the compact case, we nd half-supersymmetry preserving and asymptotically
minkowskian black string solutions. for a particular value of the scalar manifold radius, the
solution coincides with that of horne and horowitz found in the context of a string theory
in 2 + 1 dimensions.
in the non-compact case, we nd half-supersymmetry preserving and
asymptotically ads3 string solutions which have naked singularities. we also obtain two distinct
ads3 supergravities coupled to n copies of n = (1, 0) scalar multiplets either by the truncation
of the (2, 0) model or by a direct construction.

1 introduction

important advances have been made in our understanding of m -theory in ads space over the
last few years [1, 2, 3].
in particular, evidence has been accumulated for a remarkable rela-
tion between certain gauged supergravities which admit ads space as vacua and appropriate
conformal eld theories dened on the boundaries of these ads spaces. an especially manage-
able example of this phenomenon arises in the context of ads3/cf t2 correspondence. while
interesting work has been done on the cft aspects of this problem, a great deal remains to
be done on the supergravity side. with this motivation in mind, and in view of their relative
simplicity, in this paper we study the structure of matter coupledads3 supergravity theories
with n = (2, 0) and n = (1, 0) supersymmetry and their string solutions.
since the ads3 group is reducible, namely, so(2, 2)  so(2, 1)i  so(2, 1)ii , the supersym-
metry parameters could come in p copies of so(2, 1)i and q copies of so(2, 1)ii , thus de-
scribing (p, q) supersymmetry. the pure ads3 supergravity with (p, q) supersymmetry was
constructed long ago and it is a chern-simons gauge theory based on the ads3 supergroup
osp(p|1)  osp(q|1) [4]. later, the coupling of the n = (2, 0) case to n copies of scalar mul-
tiplets which parametrize a kahler manifold was constructed [5]. in this model, the scalars are
neutral under the r-symmetry group u (1). supersymmetric solutions of this model have been
studied and in particular, it has been shown [5] that the pure ads3 supergravity sector of the
theory admits the btz black hole [6] as a supersymmetric solution. the model has features
unlike the familiar gauged supergravity theories.
in fact, a higher dimensional origin of the
model, whether it is eld theoretic one or string/m-theoretic, is apparently not known.

there must exist, however, a class of (matter coupled) ads3 supergravity theories which describe
various ads3 compactications of string/m-theories. in particular, the ads3s3k3 compact-
ication of type iib string has been a subject of number of studies recently [9, 10, 11]. the full
spectrum of this compactication is known, and the massless sector is expected to be described
by a matter coupled n = (4, 4), ads3 supergravity with the gauge group so(3)l  so(3)r.
there exist other supersymmetric compactications of supergravities in diverse dimensions down
to ads3, and in all these cases, we expect to nd the gauged versions of the matter coupled
poincare supergravities in 2 + 1 dimensions constructed long ago by marcus and schwarz [12],
with the matter sector consisting of scalar multiplets with an underlying so(8, n)/so(n)so(8)
(for certain values of n implied by string theory) or e8/so(16) structure, and their lower su-
persymmetric truncations.

ultimately we would like to construct all the ads supergravities mentioned above in a unied
framework, and to study their connection with the boundary conformal eld theories. in this
paper we take the rst step in this direction. in particular, we construct an n = (2, 0), ads3
supergravity coupled to n-complex dimensional kahler manifold, and its n = (1, 0) truncation.
this paper is devoted to understanding of the supergravity aspects of these models and their
string solitons. we expect that there exist compactications of string/m-theory giving rise to
the supergravity theories studied here as their low energy limits.

as mentioned above there already exists a matter coupled n = (2, 0) ads3 supergravity con-
structed sometime ago by izguierdo and townsend [5]. however, this model diers from ours in

1

a signicant way, namely its scalar elds are neutral with respect to the r-symmetry group u (1)
unlike in our model. consequently, the model of [5] does not have a potential while our model
leads to a rather elaborate potential. in fact, some of the properties exhibited by our model are
quite similar to those which arise in gauged n = 1 supergravity coupled to a restricted kind
of kahler sigma model in d = 4 [7]. for example, the sigma model manifold arising can be
either compact or non-compact. the gravitational coupling constant, the radius of ads3 and the
radius of the sigma model manifold are not related to each other by supersymmetry, unlike the
gauged supergravities with higher supersymmetries. moreover, the radius of the sigma model
manifold, when compact, is quantized in units of the gravitational coupling constant.

we also obtain a n = (1, 0) supersymmetric version of the results mentioned above by a consis-
tent truncation of the n = (2, 0) model. we show that there exists a one parameter extension
of this n = (1, 0) theory for the coupling of single scalar multiplet.

in this paper we also present string solutions of our models which preserve half supersymmetry,
both for compact and non-compact sigma models. interestingly enough, for the compact case
there is a particular value of the radius such that the solution reduces to that of horne and
horowitz [8] found in the context of low energy limit of a string theory in 2 + 1 dimensions.
the solutions exhibit an event horizon and are asymptotically minkowskian for the compact
sigma model. the solutions for the non-compact sigma model, on the other hand, have naked
singularities and are asymptotically ads3.

the plan of this paper is as follows. in sec. 2, we describe the n = (2, 0) ads3 supergravity
coupled to an n-complex dimensional kahler sigma model. in sec. 3, we specialize to the case of
n = 1, namely cp 1 and ch 1. the black string solutions and their properties will be discussed
in sec. 4. the n = (1, 0) supersymmetric matter coupled ads3 supergravity is presented in
sec. 5. our results and a number of open problems raised by them are discussed in sec. 6.

2 n=(2,0) ads3 supergravity coupled to n scalar multiplets

a, two majorana gravitini
the n = (2, 0) ads3 supergravity multiplet consists of a graviton e
 (with the so(2) spinor index suppressed) and an so(2) gauge eld a. the n copies of the
n = (2, 0) scalar multiplet, on the other hand, consists of 2n real scalar elds ( = 1, ..., 2n)
and 2n majorana fermions r (r = 1, ..., n and the so(2) spinor indices are suppressed).
for simplicity, we will take the sigma model manifold m to be a coset space of the form g/h 
so(2) where g can be compact or non-compact and hso(2) is the maximal compact subgroup
of g, where so(2) is the r-symmetry group. for concreteness, we shall consider

m+ =

so(n + 2)

so(n)  so(2)

,

m =

so(n, 2)

so(n)  so(2)

(2.1)

our results can be readily translated to the case of g/h  u (1) with g = su (n + 1) of su (n, 1)
and h = su (n).

the metric ij = diag(+ + ... + ).
the so(2) gauged pull-back of the maurer-cartan form on m can be decomposed into the

the anti-hermitian so(2) generator tij occurring in this denition is realized in terms of an

in coupling m to supergravity, we will also need the introduction of the boosted matrix

ijskr = (l1tijl)kr .

we have set the gravitational coupling constant  equal to one, but it can easily be introduced
by dimensional analysis. the constant a is the characteristic curvature of m (e.g. 2a is the
inverse radius in the case of m+ = s2) and the constant m is the ads3 cosmological constant.

1our conventions are as follows: ab = ( + +),  = i0, c and  c are symmetric, the so(2) charge
is symmetric and {i, j } = 2ij . a convenient representation is 1 = 1,

conjugation matrix is unity, i
2 = 3. we dene 3 = 12. note that (3)2 = 1.

4

the u (1) gauge coupling constant has been absorbed into the denition of a. we emphasize
that, unlike in a typical anti de sitter supergravity coupled to matter, here the constants , a, m
are not related to each other for non-compact scalar manifolds, while a will be quantized in
terms of  in the compact case, as we shall see later.

(2.10)

the coecients in front of the composite connection q has been determined by supersymmetry.

having dened the above covariant derivative, we can now see more clearly why the c- and
s-functions arise in the model. firstly, the supersymmetric variation of the gravitino kinetic
term involves the commutator

[d, d] = 1

4 rabab

2a2 (cid:16)ijp ir

 p jr

 + f c(cid:17) 3 .

(2.11)

this is where we see rst the occurrence of the function c. the c-dependent term arising
here is cancelled by the variation of the chern-simons term. the rest of the noether procedure
eventually involves the dierentiation of the function c which leads to the function sir, and its
dierentiation leads to the function c rs.

it is straightforward to adapt all the formulae given above in terms of n complex scalars
( = 1, ..., n) and n dirac spinors r and a dirac gravitino , with the dreibein ea
 and
vector eld a, of course, remaining real. typical sigma model manifolds arising in this way
are the compact cp n and non-compact ch n, if we are only concerned about the local aspects
of the symmetries involved. insisting that the model is globally well dened, some restrictions
will arise on the scalar manifold geometry, as was shown long ago by witten and bagger in the
context of n = 1 supersymmetric models coupled to supergravity in d = 4. these restrictions
typically occur when the scalar manifold is compact. indeed, as in [7], here too the compact
scalar manifold turns out to be a hodge manifold, which is a certain type of kahler manifold.
an important consequence of this is that the radius of the scalar manifold gets quantized in
units of the planck length. this phenomenon is explained in detail in [7] and therefore will not
be repeated here. however, we shall get back to the specics of the quantization condition in the
next section where we consider the black string solutions of the model when the scalar manifold
is in eect taken to be s2. in the case of h 2 the quantization condition does not arise.

let us consider various limits of this model. firstly, by rescaling a  a2a and the matter
scalar elds such that p ir
 and then sending the inverse sigma model radius a  0 such
that c  1, sir  0, one obtains n = (2, 0), ads3 supergravity with cosmological constant

  ap ir

5

2m2 coupled to an r2n sigma model. the pure n = (2, 0), ads3 supergravity [4] can then
be obtained by setting all the matter elds equal to zero. to obtain the poincare limit of the
theory [12, 13, 14] , on the other hand, we start with the lagrangian (2.8), rescale a  ma
and then let m  0. once the poincare limit is taken, the supergravity elds can further be
decoupled by setting the gravitini equal to zero and taking the metric to be at minkowskian.
this yields an n = (2, 0) supersymmetric sigma model. a rigid ads3 supersymmetric limit
does not seem to be possible in this model.

3 the cases of s2 and h 2

the variables of the model presented above can easily be complexied so that the scalar manifold
becomes generically cp n = su (n + 1)/su (n)  u (1) or ch n = su (n, 1)/su (n)  u (1). in
search of a string solution, it is convenient to set equal to zero all but one of the n-complex scalar
elds in such a way that the model is consistently truncated to an s2 = su (2)/u (1) or h 2 =
su (1, 1)/u (1) sigma model coupled to the ads3 supergravity with n = (2, 0) supersymmetry.
the r2 geometry can easily be accounted for as the innite radius limit of h 2.

the coset representative l for s2 and h 2 can be parametrized as

l =

the key relations (2.6) take the form

c =  (p

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

the functions c and s are computed from the denitions (2.5), which, for the cases at hand,
are

l1t3l = 1

2 (s1  is2)(t1 + it2) + ct3 ,

(3.4)

where the generators of su (2) and su (1, 1) algebras are

6

[t1, t2] = t3,

[t2, t3] = t1 ,

[t3, t1] = t2 .

(3.5)

representing (t1, t2, t3) by (i1, i2,i3)/2 for su (2) and (1,2, i3)/2 for su (1, 1), we
obtain from (3.4)

c =

similarly, the nonlinear covariant derivative p and the so(2) connection q are computed

(3.9)

in describing the sigma model manifolds, we have used a particular coordinate system. we
have to ensure that this description makes sense globally.
in fact, the coordinates  are the
stereographic projection of s2 or h 2 onto the complex plane. in the case of h 2 this is a globally
well dened coordinate system to cover the manifold. but in the case of s2, as is well known,
one needs two patches in order to avoid the singularities at the north and south poles. following
the standard procedure, we cover the upper hemisphere with coordinate  and the lower one by
1/. we must then check that the action is well dened in the overlap region. to achieve this,
we also need to transform the gauge eld as a  a. under the combined transformation

the quantities c, s, p and q transform as

 (cid:19) s ,
 (cid:19) p ,

(3.10)

(3.11)

for these transformations to leave the action invariant, we must also transform the fermionic
elds. noting that these terms are given by

to be single valued, we need to impose, a la witten and bagger [7], the quantization condition

before presenting the black string solutions,it is worthwhile to note that the theory admits
various maximally symmetric vacua. for the case of s2,the potential (4.2) has minimum at  = 0
corresponding to a supersymmetric ads3 vacuum, a valley of minima at  = ei corresponding
to a supersymmetric 2 + 1 dimensional minkowski vacuum and two valleys of maxima at  =

(1/1)1/2ei, where  = a/2a2 + 1, corresponding to non-supersymmetric de sitter vacua.
here  is an arbitrary real scalar eld. for the case of h 2, we have the following extrema: (i)
for a  1/2, there is a maximum at  = 0 which is a supersymmetric ads3 vacuum, (ii)
for 1/2 < a2 < 1, there are two valleys of minima at  = ( + 1/    1)1/2ei where
 = a/2a2  1 which are non-supersymmetric ads3 vacua, (iii) for a2  1 there is a minimum
at  = 0 which is a supersymmetric ads3 vacuum. the case (ii) similar in nature to a situation
encountered in nding the extrema of the gauged d = 7 supergravity theory [15].

let us now consider the following ansatz for the metric

where a, b are functions of the transverse coordinate r only. next, we set

ds2 = e2a(dt2 + dx2) + e2bdr2 ,

 = || , a = 0 ,  = 0 ,

 = 0 .

then, the supersymmetry condition  = 0 implies that

eb = 4ma2c ,

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

where the prime indicates dierentiation with respect to r, provided that we also impose the
condition

1 =  ,

(4.12)

which means that we are seeking half-supersymmetry preserving solution. the choice of minus
sign is merely for convenience.

the supersymmetry conditions 0 = 0 and 2 = 0 are satised provided that

the remaining condition 1 = 0 determines the r-dependence of the spinor  to be

a = 2mc 2eb .

 = s1/4a2

(1  1)0 ,

(4.13)

(4.14)

where 0 is an arbitrary constant spinor. next, we use (4.13) in (4.11), and solve for a in terms
of :

10

ea = (cid:18) 2

1 + 2(cid:19)



2a2

,

(4.15)

where we have set a multiplicative integration constant equal to 2 for convenience. thus, the
metric takes the form

ds2 = (cid:18) 2

1 + 2(cid:19)/a2

(dt2 + dx2) +

1

1  2!2
16m2a4   1 + 2

(cid:19)2
(cid:18) 

dr2

(4.16)

it is straightforward to verify that all the eld equations are satised by this metric and the
ansatz (4.9).

the fact that  is not determined by the equations of motion is a consequence of having free-
dom in reparametrizing the radial coordinate r. indeed, the function  can be determined by
performing a -dependent r-coordinate transformation. a convenient such transformation is

1  2(r)!2
r  r = m   1 + 2(r)

,

(4.17)

where m is an integration constant. we next analyze the compact and non-compact cases
separately.

4.1 the case of h 2 ( = 1)
the inversion of (4.17) yields the r-dependence of 

 =  r  m

r + m!1/2

.

(4.18)

where the tilde on r has been dropped for notational convenience.
in obtaining this result,
we have chosen the positive root in (4.17). the negative root gives an expression for  which
diverges at r = m . note that r  m implies   0 in accordance with the fact that  is the
stereographic coordinate of h 2.

the transformation (4.17) turns the metric (4.16) into

ds2 = (cid:18) r

m  1(cid:19)

1
2a2

(dt2 + dx2) +

1

64m2a4r2 (cid:18) r

m  1(cid:19)2

dr2.

(4.19)

this metric has no horizons and there is a naked singularity. to see this, we rst let r  r + m
and then dene a new radial coordinate u = m/r. the metric then takes the form

11

ds2 = (u)

1

2a2 (dt2 + dx2) +

1

64m2a4(u + 1)2 du2.

(4.20)

the asymptotic geometry near u =  is ads3. the metric has a singularity at u = 0, while
it is regular at other points. the fact that u = 0 is a genuine singularity can be seen from the
curvature scalar associated with this metric, given by

r =

8m2(u + 1)

u2

h8a2  3(u + 1)i ,

(4.21)

which clearly diverges for u = 0. the implications of this naked singularity for the cosmic
censorship conjecture remains to be investigated.

finally, we nd that the ads energy per unit length for the string metric (4.20) vanishes.
actually, the commutator of two n = (2, 0) supersymmetry transformations can be shown to
vanish at radial innity, but one cannot deduce from this alone that the ads energy vanishes.
this is due to the fact that the result is a combination of the true lorentz rotations and
translations in ads3. a more convenient method to pin down the ads energy for the case at
hand is due to hawking and horowitz [16], and applying this method, we indeed nd the result
stated above, namely the vanishing of the ads energy for our solution.

4.2 the case of s2 ( = 1)

the inversion of (4.17) for the upper hemisphere s2

+ yields

+ =  r  m

r + m!1/2

for the lower hemisphere s2

 we obtain

 =  r + m

r  m!1/2

.

.

(4.22)

(4.23)

note that r  m in both cases, in accordance with the fact that  are the stereographic
coordinates of s2 such that 0  +  1 and 1   < . in fact, + and  constitute a well
dened map from spacetime into s2.

with the scalar eld specied as in (4.22) or (4.23), the metric (4.16) becomes

note that for this case 1/a2 is quantized to be an integer. this metric is asymptotically
minkowskian. moreover, there is a horizon at r = m , and the near horizon geometry is ads3.
the hawking temperature of this black string can be readily shown to be vanishing. thus, we
expect this solution to be quantum mechanically stable.

the curvature scalar associated with the metric (4.24) is

r =

(4.25)

which is regular at r = m . this formula also shows that there is a singularity at r = 0. however,
for some values of the parameter a the singularity cannot be reached by the observers outside
the horizon. to investigate this point, let us consider the geodesic equation. let  be tangent
to an anely parametrized geodesic, and let us dene the conserved quantities associated with
the two translations on the string worldsheet as e =   /t, p =   /x. then the geodesic
equation associated with the metric (4.24) takes the form

(4.26)

where the dot denotes derivative with respect to an ane parameter,  = 0 for null geodesics
and  = 1 for timelike geodesics. for  = 1, the geodesics can not reach the horizon.
indeed, there is a turning point corresponding to the vanishing of the right hand side of (4.26).
for  = 0, a simple analysis of (4.26) near the horizon shows that when 1/2a2 is an even integer
the region r < m is accessible, but not accessible when 1/2a2 is an odd or half integer. for
the former case, we need to extend the denition of  to the region r < m . however, einstein
equations imply that c 2 = m/r and thus c > 1 for r < m . on the other hand, we see from
its denition that c 2  1 for any value of . therefore, we can not extend the solution to the
region r < m when 1/2a2 is an even integer.

to summarize, we have physically well dened black string solutions for

1
a2 = 1, 2, 3 mod 4 .

(4.27)

in these cases the timelike or null geodesics can not penetrate the horizon located at r = m ,
and the eld  need not be extended to the region r < m .

for a2 = 1/2, the metric (4.24) coincides with the metric found by horne and horowitz [8]
obtained from a dierent starting point, namely low energy limit of a string theory in 2 + 1
dimensions described by the lagrangian

e1l = e(cid:18)r +    1

12 hh  +

8

k(cid:19) ,

(4.28)

where h = db and k is a constant. in einstein frame, this lagrangian takes the form

13

e1l = r    1

2 e4h 2 + 8

k e2 .

(4.29)

the metric (4.16) is a solution for this theory, with the dilaton given by  = ln (rpk/2 ). what

we have shown here is that not only this metric is a solution of two rather dierent theories but
it is also supersymmetric. we note that the string theory which should generate our matter
coupled n = (2, 0) ads3 supergravity model remains to be determined.
finally, we note that the mass per unit length for our general string solutions in the s2 sigma
model case can be conveniently deduced from the algebra of supercharges, since these solutions
are asymptotically minkowskian. a standard procedure which makes use of the nester two-form
(see, for example, [17, 18]) yields the result

[q1, q2] = lim
r

012

g

1(cid:16)d2 + m2c 2(cid:17) 2

= 1(cid:16)0p0 + 2p2(cid:17) 2 ,

(4.30)

where p0 = p2 = 8m2a2m , and 0, 1, 2 refer to the time, radial and x-directions, respectively,
in coordinate basis (012 = 1, in our conventions). thus, the string has mass and momentum
per unit length 8m2a2m . we refer the reader to [19] for a study of various aspects of this
phenomenon.

5 the n = (1, 0) ads3 truncation

the n = (2, 0) model described in the previous sections admits a truncation to n = (1, 0)
supersymmetric ads3 supergravity coupled to n scalar multiplets. it is straightforward to check
that the following truncation is consistent:

a = 0 ,

p 1r

 = 0 ,

(5.1)

(1  2) = 0 ,

(1  2)r = 0 ,

(1  2) = 0 .

the condition p 1r
convenient way to realize this condition is to parametrize l as follows

 = 0 amounts to setting n of the original 2n scalar elds equal to zero. a

c rs = 0 ,

s2r = 0 ,

performing the truncation procedure described above, we are left with the n = (1, 0) ads3
supergravity multiplet consisting of a dreibein and a single majorana gravitino, and n copies of
n = (1, 0) scalar multiplets each one of which contain a real scalar and a majorana spinor. the

the index i now labels the n + 1 dimensional representation of so(n + 1) or so(n, 1), and the
matrices (li , li
r) together form an element of these groups. the latter can be represented by
(5.2) with the (n + 1)st row and column deleted.

clearly the black string solution of the n = (2, 0) model described in section 4 is also a solution
of the n = (1, 0) model given here.

the c- and s-functions dened in (2.6) arose as a consequence of the commutator (2.11). it
is noteworthy that these functions still arise in the n = (1, 0) model despite the fact that the
commutator (2.11) no longer occurs. indeed, as far as supersymmetry is concerned, all that
is required of the c and s-functions is that they obey the relations (5.5). this suggests the
possibility of a more general solution for them. to see this, let us consider the case of so(1, 1)
scalar manifold. in that case the c- and s-functions take the simple form

where we have dened  = sinh . the bosonic lagrangian then becomes

c = cosh  ,

s = sinh  ,

e1l = 1

where

a more general solution of the dening relation (5.5) is

v = 2m2cosh2 (cid:16)2a2sinh2   cosh2 (cid:17) .

c = a1e + a2e ,

s = a1e + a2e ,

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

(5.12)

where a1, a2 are arbitrary real constants. these functions dene a family of n = (1, 0) ads3
coupled to a single scalar multiplet, with potential

v () = 4m2a2(cid:20)(cid:0)a1e + a2e(cid:1)4 

16

2a2 (cid:16)a2

2e2(cid:17)2(cid:21) .

(5.13)

in fact, a1/a2 is the only independent parameter, due to the freedom in rescaling the parameter
m. for a1/a2 = 1, one obtains the n = (1, 0) truncation of the n = (2, 0) model discussed
above.

6 conclusions

we have constructed the coupling of n-complex dimensional kahler sigma models of certain
type to the ads3 supergravity with n = (2, 0) supersymmetry and we have obtained the black
string solutions of this model. we have also obtained the n = (1, 0) truncation of our model,
which still admits a potential as well as the solutions of the n = (2, 0) model discussed here.

our models generically depend on two parameters which characterize the sizes of the ads3
and the sigma model manifold, respectively.moreover, the geometry of the sigma models can be
compact or non-compact. the properties of the string solutions presented here depend on the
geometry of the sigma model. in the compact case, we have found asymptotically minkowskian
black string solutions, while in the non-compact case we have found asymptotically ads3 string
solutions with naked singularities. in the former case, our solution is found to coincide with
that of horne and horowitz [8] for a particular radius of the compact sigma model manifold.

a previously constructed [5] coupling of a kahler sigma model to n = (2, 0), ads3 supergravity
diers from our model signicantly in that the scalar elds of that model are neutral under the
r-symmetry group u (1). one consequence of having assigned a u (1) charge to the scalar elds
is the emergence of a potential, which plays a signicant role in the determination of our black
string solutions.

as for the classical solutions of our model, it is natural to seek supersymmetric black holes.
indeed, we have searched for solutions of the form ds2 = e2adt2 + e2bdr2 + r2d2. setting
the scalar eld equal to zero reduces the equations of motion to those of pure anti de sitter
supergravity which is known to have the btz black hole solution [5]. however, if we insist on
non-vanishing scalar elds, then the supersymmetry condition, together with the eld equations,
leads to a solution which upon coordinate transformations can be brought to the string solution
of the form (4.24).

it would be interesting to nd a solution in which the maxwell eld plays a role. in this context,
we note that the einsteins equation rule out nonvanishing gauge elds if we take all the elds
to be only r-dependent. presumably, therefore, one should allow x dependence as well.

a natural extension of our model would be the introduction of higher than n = (2, 0) super-
symmetry. an interesting case to consider is the matter coupled n = (4, 4), ads3 supergravity
model which arises from the compactication of the d = 6, n = (2, 0) supergravity coupled to
n tensor multiplets, which has its origin in the k3 compactication of type iib string.

the question of how the models we have presented in this paper can be obtained from any
compactication of m-theory or, for that matter, any higher dimensional supergravity theory
remains open. the exact form of the cft dual of our model formulated on the boundary of
ads3 also remains to be found.

17

finally, we note that the model constructed in this paper does not involve any two-form poten-
tials. these potentials would not describe propagating degrees of freedom but they might be
useful in producing the low energy supergravity theory in the bulk in a form which is more ap-
propriate in the string theory or the boundary cft context. in the models we have constructed
here, it is natural to introduce (n + 2) two-form potentials which form an so(n, 2) vector. the
form of the scalar potential in the action is then expected to change, but elimination of the two-
form potential from the action through its equations of motion should yield the scalar potential
of the model presented here.
