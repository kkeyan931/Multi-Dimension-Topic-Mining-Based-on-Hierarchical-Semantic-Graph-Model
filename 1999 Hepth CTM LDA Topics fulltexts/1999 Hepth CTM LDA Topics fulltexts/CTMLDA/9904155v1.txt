abstract

we discuss the possibility of the extension of the duality between
the webs of heterotic string and the type iia string to calabi-yau
3-folds with another k3 ber by comparing the dual polyhedron of
calabi-yau 3-folds given by candelas, perevalov and rajesh.

1 introduction

some calabi-yau manifolds with base, cip1(1, s) and ber,
k3= cip3(u1, u2, u3, u4)[d] are represented in hypersurface in weighted pro-
jective 4-space, cip4.

cy3 = cip4(u1, su1, (s + 1)u2, (s + 1)u3, (s + 1)u4))[(s + 1)d],

(1)

i=1 ui.

with d = p4
the type iia string on cy3-folds which have k3 ber and t2 ber with
at least one section is dual to the heterotic string on k3  t2 pointed out
in [1, 2]. much research has been explored on cy3-folds with s = 1 and
u1=1 cases and f0 based case [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7]. s = 1 and u1=1 cases
are given by the extremal transitions or by the conifold transitions from f0
based cy3-folds [5, 6, 7].

thus, cy3-folds which have been studied are constructed by using dual
polyhedra. some of them may relate to the hypersurface representations of
eq. (1) with s  2. however, identications between them have some ambi-
guities and are complicated [9, 10, 11, 12]. therefore, the relation between
these results and the duality between the type iia on cy3-folds with s  2
to hetro on k3  t2 is not clear yet. there have been three types of web
sequences of hetro-type iia duality from the terminal cy3-fold in a series
[4, 5, 6].

(iii) may be the subset of (i), though the properties of dual polyhedron
are slightly dierent 1. (i) means the modied (i) with extra tensor multi-
plets.

1 the dierence between dual polyhedron of (i) and (iii) is as follows [5, 6, 7]. the
dual polyhedra of case (i) have the modied dual polyhedra of k3 ber. for the case
(iii) in a series, the dual polyhedron of k3 ber is not modied. the highest point in the
additional points is represented by the weights of the k3 ber of the terminal a series in
this base. one point such as (0, , , ) is also represented by the part of the weight of the
terminal k3 ber. the following element in sl(4,z) can transform these polyhedra into
the dual polyhedron given by the ref. of [6].

the puzzles which we would like to consider are as follows:

i: why (iii) and (iv) have the same hodge numbers for a series ? do (iv)
satisfy the duality ? though k3 bers of cy3-folds in (iv) are dierent from
those in (iii), is there any gauge enhancement for (iv) ?

ii: is it possible to obtain the conifold transition of (iii) in b or c series
which satisfy the duality ? about this question, candelas et al. already gave
the method to construct dual polyhedron[6, 7]. they pointed out that their
hodge numbers are obtained by shrinking of tensor multiplets [7].

iii: is it possible to obtain the conifold transition of (iv) in b or c series

which satisfy the duality ?

iv: do the hodge numbers of (iii) in b or c series coincide with those

of (iv)?

v: are there any hypersurface represented cy3-folds with s  2 from

n0  4 which satisfy the duality ?

in section 2, we investigate prob. i. we also discuss prob. iii by using

the results of of [4] and [7] in section 3.

4similarly to a, for b and c, the modications may follow

b-chain : k1 + m1 = k0
c-chain : k1 + m1a + m1b = k0
which we will discuss in this article.

1 + m0

1 = 12, k2 + m2 = 12  nt ,

1 + m0

1a + m0

1b = 12, k2 + m2a + m2b = 12  nt ,

5 29 is the dual coxetor number of e8 - one [4, 7]. the subtraction of one means the
freedom of xing the place where a tensor multiplet is created. the dual coxetor number
of e7 -one = 17 works for b-chain case when a tensor multiplet is created and that of e6
-one =11 for the c-chain case [4, 7].

6in d=4 and n=2 case, these tensor multiplets become vector multiplets.

2 the duality in k3 bered calabi-yau 3-fold

we treat the extension from a-chain n0 = 2 terminal case. cy3 =
cip4(1, s, (s + 1)(1, 4, 6))[12(s + 1)] with k3 = cip3(1, 1, 4, 6)[12] ber have
the same hodge numbers as those examples given by [6, 8]. to see the
reason why they coincide, we compare dual polyhedron of cy 3-folds. they
are not sl(4,z) equivalent. we represent them in the base by which one
of vertices of dual polyhedron in the bottom denotes the part of its weight
(s, s  1, 4(s + 1), 6(s +
for the hypersurface representation.
1)) in this case. the base manifold under the elliptic bration is f2 for
s = 1 case. fi denotes hirzebruch surface. the dual polyhedron of fi has
three vertices : {~v1, ~v2, ~v1  i~v2}. an example of integral points of the dual
polyhedron of fi is given by {~v1 = (1, 0), (0, 1), ~v2 = (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, i)}.
the hodge numbers and the dualities with n0 = 0 case are derived by
investigating the extremal transition of the dual polyhedron of f0 based cy3-
fold in [6]. f0 based cy3-fold and f2 based cy3-fold are not topologically
equivalent but in the cip1 large limit, superpotential behave similarly [1].

it is

by using dual polyhedra, we can nd a brations and base manifolds in
some cases [5, 7, 11, 12]. the upper sux in  denotes the dimension of the
lattice of a polyhedron. {(x1, x2, x3, x4)}  4 forms the dual polyhedron of
cy3-fold. {(x1, x2)}  2  4 represents the dual polyhedron of the base
under the elliptic bration of cy3-folds. in this paper, they are the blown

dual polyhedron of k3 ber of cy3-fold. {(x3, x4)} |x1=x2=0  2  4
are the dual polyhedron of common elliptic ber of cy3-folds and k3ber.
however, this is not a sucient condition of having elliptic bration. the
result of brations in cy3-folds is given in table 1.

in s  2 case, the additional integral points to f2 are {(i, i  1) with
2  i  s, (1, 1)} within the base. thus, s  2 case, the base manifolds
remain blown up f2 since s+1
s  2. we can see the hodge number of the
base under the elliptic bration and nt from dual polyhedron, nt + 1 =
h1,1(f2 blown up) = d1  2d0 = s + 2 (s  2), where d0 and d1 denote each
dimension of 0-dim. cones and 1-dim. cones [13]. nt coincides with case (iii)
[7] . on the other side, k3 brations of case (iii) with n0 = 0 change so that

we conjecture that blown up f2 based cy3-folds from a series of n0 = 2
case also can be deformed to those of candelas et al. from n0 = 0 case by
using a non-polynomial freedom. s=i,nt =i  nt =i, where  denotes
dual polyhedron of case (iv) and  denotes those of case (iii) [6].

the cy3-fold with s = 1 is the terminal case of a-chains with n0 = 2 in
the duality web [4]. if duality exists, then their hodge numbers must satisfy
the following conditions which comes from d=6 and d=4 theories as the
anomaly cancellation [1, 5, 6].

this duality between hetro and type iia is summarized in the table 4, which

for cy3-folds side, g1 and g2 symmetries may be due to the extra quo-
tient singularities rather than that of k3 ber in table 2. the quotient
singularity in k3 ber, cip3(1, 1, 4, 6)[12] is only z2 symmetry.

3 discussion and conclusion

in this article, we have studied the property of cy3-folds with s  2 case
from a series. for the puzzle iii, the conclusion is that the hypersurface
representations with s  2 cases from b series and c series in n0 = 2 satisfy
the duality of terminal b and c series with extra tensor multiplets 7. for
example, b and c series in s=2, their hodge numbers can be interpreted as
those with shrinking of two instantons from n0 = 2 case as the ref. of [7].
s  3 cases are also explained by shrinking nt instantons from the terminal
case with the same g2 symmetry.

h1,1 = h0

: h2,1 = 17h1,1, c series : h2,1 = 11h1,1.

(7)

this situation is quite similar to that of a series. they are interpreted as
the dualities obtained by unhiggsing of u(1) and u(1)2 from (iv) in a series.
we compared some superpotentials of type iib side in case (iii) and those
in case (iv) and examined the possibility to derive the terminal gauge sym-

7 for b and c sequences, the modication of eq.

(7) is necessary. the change in
the hodge numbers, h2,1 according to the change of the terminal group is not only the
dierence of dim. g2 [4, 7]. thus we compare the hodge numbers of cy3-folds which
have the same terminal gauge symmetry.

table 6: the duality of (i) about terminal cy3-folds in b series

metry by the method of [15]. for example of case (iv), cy3-fold is f2 based
and k3=cip3(1,1,4,6)[12] bered with s = 3, nt = 3 and a2
terminal
gauge symmetry. there are two ways of the parameter expansion near the
singularities of k3 ber to get singularities of cy3-fold, that is, a2  a2,
which agree with a2 in type iia side8. we will give dual polyhedra of case
(iv) in the next paper to report about superpotentials more precisely.

for puzzle iv, candelas et al. are seemed to construct b and c version
of (iii) and derived the hodge numbers already, though they do not write
them explicitely [7]. according to the description, hodge numbers of them
are the same as table 5 and table 7.

for the puzzle v, we examine k3 berd cy3-folds whose s=1 case is the

terminal case in the a-chains with n0 = 4. their k3 ber is
k3=cip3(1,2,6,9)[18]. the dual polyhedron of s = 2 case has following
additional points (-2, -6,-18, -27), (-1,-3,-10,-15) and (-1, -3,-9,-14), which
imply nt =1. h1,1 |s=2 h0
