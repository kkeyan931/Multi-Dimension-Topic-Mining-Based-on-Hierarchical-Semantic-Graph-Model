abstract

a recent study shows that hawking radiation of the massless scalar eld

does not appear on the two-dimensional ads2 black hole background. we

study this issue by investigating absorption and reection coecients under

dilaton coupling with the matter eld. if the scalar eld does not couple to

the dilaton, then it is fully absorbed into the black hole without any outgoing

mode. on the other hand, once it couples to the dilaton eld, the outgoing

mode of the massless scalar eld exists and the nontrivial hawking radiation

is obtained. finally, we comment on this dilaton dependence of hawking

radiation in connection with a three-dimensional black hole.

recently, there has been great interests in anti-de sitter (ads) spacetimes in connection

with various aspects of ads black hole physics, for example, in the calculation of black

hole entropies [1] in terms of lower-dimensional ads gravity theories, the three-dimensional

banados-teitelboim-zanelli(btz) black hole [2] and ads2 black holes [3].

on the other hand, greybody factor [4,5] of the massless scalar eld on this btz back-

ground has been studied by birmingham, sachs, and sen(bss) [6] and they obtained the

absorption cross section related to the hawking radiation [7] by carefully considering the

matching procedure between the bulk and the ads boundary. in two-dimensional case, it

has been shown that the absorption coecient is one and there are no reection modes [8],

which means that there does not exist any massless radiation on this two-dimensional ads

black hole background. this fact seems to be consistent with the argument in ref. [9] since

expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor around the two-dimensional ads black

hole is zero.

in this paper, we would like to study this issue whether the hawking radiation appears

on the two-dimensional ads black hole background or not in terms of the scattering analysis

of the massless scalar eld as a test eld. we shall assume that the classical metric-dilaton

background and then the scalar wave equation will be solved on this background for two

cases depending on the dilaton coupling. for the rst case, the free scalar eld equation is

solved, and by carefully matching this solution with the boundary solution we obtain the

expected null radiation. once the boundary condition that the outgoing modes are absent is

imposed at the horizon, there are no more outgoing modes at the bulk and the boundary. on

the other hand, for the second case of the minimal coupling with the dilaton background ,

which is just jackiw-teitelboim (jt) model [10], the scalar eld equation is exactly solved in

the bulk and the boundary. by imposing appropriate boundary conditions, we obtain at last

the nontrivial hawking radiation. in this latter case, the vanishing limit of the dilaton eld

does not exist in this calculational method, and the two cases are distinct in the scattering

analysis.

let us now assume the following metric-dilaton background as

ds2 =  m +

where the metric (1) describes ads black hole with the horizon rh = m  which is asymp-
totically ads2 spacetime, and its curvature is constant, r =  2
hawking temperature as

2 . one can assert the

th =

rh
22

,

(3)

which may be given by the conventional procedure to avoid the conical singularity of the

metric in euclidean formalism. at rst glance, this temperature, however, does not seem to

depend on the dilaton eld. the purpose of the present paper in some sense is to study the

dilaton dependence of the black hole temperature in terms of the scattering analysis.

we are now going to study the scattering amplitudes of a test eld on the ads black hole

background in order to calculate the hawking radiation and temperature from the dynamical

process. let us now consider the following scalar eld f obeying

f + f = 0.

(4)

for  = 0, the matter eld does not couple to the metric, whereas it couples explicitly

with the dilaton eld for  = 1 1. here, we consider only two cases in order to compare

the behavior of scattering of scalar eld on the ads black hole background, and study the

dilaton dependence of hawking radiation. in fact, for the case of  = 0 corresponding to the

constant dilaton background, the ads2 model [9] has been constructed by using the callan-

giddings-harvey-strominger (cghs) model [12]2. for the other case of  = 1, it has been

well appreciated as a two-dimensional ads gravity [1517]. let us study hawking radiation

(5)

hereafter, let us treat two cases separately since they are drastically dierent.

for the rst case of  = 0, we shall calculate the scattering amplitude of massless

scalar eld on the ads black hole background, and then infer the hawking radiation and

temperature. by performing change of the variable as z = rrh
r+rh

(0  z  1), the equation

of motion eq. (5) can be simply written in the form of

z(1  z)2

z r(0)(z) + (1  z)zr(0)(z) +

24
4r2

(

z  1)r(0)(z) = 0.

(6)

by dening r(0)(z) = zg(z), the wave equation is given as

z g(z) + (1  z)(2 + 1)zg(z) +" 1

z(1  z)2
and the nonsingular solution is nally obtained with 2 =  24

note that this is an exact solution dened over the bulk. further, in the far region, it is also

simply written as

r .

(9)

at this stage, we should carefully consider the boundary of this ads black hole because it

has nontrivial background geometry in contrast to the asymptotically at black hole. the

background geometry of the usual black hole at the asymptotically far region is happened

to be that of the massless limit of the black hole geometry. so, in that case, the far region

limit means the massless limit of the black hole geometry, however, in our model this is not

the case. therefore, we take the boundary metric by dening m = 0 in eq. (1). then the

equation of motion at the boundary is given by

r22

r r(0)(r) + 2rrr(0)(r) +

r(0)(r) = 0,

and its solution is easily obtained as

(r) = ainei 2

(10)

(11)

it is interesting to note that the asymptotic solution eq. (9) is compatible with the boundary

solution eq. (11) if we identify cin = ain and cout = aout.

by using the expression of the ux expressed as

f() =

(12)

we can straightforwardly dene the absorption coecient (a) and reection coecient (r)

as

a = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(13)

where f in

()(r = rh;) and f out

() (r = rh ;) are ingoing and outgoing uxes at the horizon
and boundary, respectively. at the horizon, we impose the boundary condition as cout = 0

[18], then the outgoing mode does not appear at the bulk and the boundary. therefore, the

reection coecient is zero, r = 0 3. by the use of the following relation which relates the

reection coecient and hawking thermal radiation [18],

< 0|n|0 >=

we can assume the vanishing hawking temperature,

th = 0

(14)

(15)

for the nite mode of the scalar eld,  > 0 since r = 0. this fact is compatible with

the result of ref. [9] where the hawking radiation has been studied in terms of the energy-

momentum tensor of massless scalar eld. therefore, for  = 0 case, there is no reection

3even though one chooses the other boundary condition as aout = 0 in ref. [18], in this case also

the reection coecient is zero as it should be.

mode in ads2 black hole background and there does not exist massless radiation in our

scattering analysis.

let us now study the second case of  = 1 with the dilaton coupling of eq. (4). in
this case, we perform a change of variable to solve the eld equation exactly as z = r2r2

h

r2

(0  z  1). so the spatial(radial) equation of motion (5) is given by

z(1  z)2

z r(1)(z) + (1  z)zr(1)(z) +

24
4r2
hz

r(1)(z) = 0,

(16)

and it is rewritten as

z(1  z)2

z g(z) + (1 + 2)(1  z)zg(z) +" 1

z  2 +

24
4r2

h !  2# g(z) = 0,

where r(1)(z) = zg(z). the equation of motion (17) becomes

z(1  z)2

z g(z) + (1 + 2)(1  z)zg(z)  2g(z) = 0

(17)

(18)

after choosing the constant  as 2 =  24
, and the standard solution is given by the linear
combination of two hypergeometric functions f (a, b, c; z) and z1cf (a+1c, b+1c, 2c; z)
where

4r2

h

a = , b = , c = 1 + 2.

then, the bulk solution can be neatly written as

r(1)(r) = zcinf (,, 1  2; z) + zcoutf (, , 1 + 2; z).

(19)

(20)

note that it is symmetric under interchange of the sign of , and we simply take the plus

sign of .

in the near horizon limit (z  0), the solution is reduced to

(21)

on the other hand, the large-r behavior of the bulk solution (20) follows from the z  1 z
transformation law for the hypergeometric functions [19]:

f (a, b, a + b + m; z) =

(m)(a + b + m)

(23)

as was emphasized for the case of  = 0, at the boundary (z = 1), we have to solve the

wave equation in order to match their coecients with those of eq. (23). so the boundary

wave equation

r22

r r(1)(r) + 3rrr(1)(r) +

(27)

where a and b are arbitrary constants. we can rewrite this solution in terms of the ingoing

(28)

(34)

which is interestingly coincident with the statistical hawking temperature eq. (3).

note that we had an ambiguity in the boundary solution eq. (29) in ads2 spacetime

[6], and the hawking temperature may not be uniquely determined. this phenomenon

has already appeared in dening the surface gravity in the ads black hole. there is no

preferred normalization of timelike killing vector in the asymptotic region and the surface

gravity depends upon this normalization [20]. so we may not obtain the usual expression

of the hawking temperature in our calculation too. however, in our boundary solution, we

xed this ambiguity and the well-known expression of the hawking temperature eq. (3) is

obtained.

4as for the second kind of boundary conguration, we can choose aout = 0 as in [18]. so, after

performing matching procedure, we can calculate the ratio of coecients between ingoing and

we have shown that the nontrivial dilaton coupling for the second case of  = 1 plays

an important role in the hawking radiation process on the two-dimensional ads black hole,

which is contrasted with the rst case of  = 0. this fact can be traced back and the

origin may be found from the three-dimensional btz black hole. let us consider the three-

dimensional model as

s =

1

2 z d3xg(cid:20)r +

2

2(cid:21) 

1

4 z d3xg(f )2

(35)

which yields a well-known btz black hole solution for f = 0 [2]. the absorption coecient

and cross section of the scalar eld f around the btz black hole background have been

calculated by bss in ref. [6]. therefore if we take s1 compactication along the angular axis

as (ds)2

(3) = (cid:16)g

(2) + e2aa(cid:17) dxdx +2e2adxdx3 +e2dx3

2 where ,  = 0, 1, and x3

is angular coordinate in three dimensions, the two-dimensional ads black hole conguration

of eqs. (1) and (2) are obtained for the vanishing kaluza-klein charge [3]. in this s-wave

reduction, the equation of motion of the massless eld around this ads2 black hole becomes

exactly eq. (4) only for  = 1. therefore, the nonvanishing hawking radiation in our model

is due to the dilaton related to the transverse radius of the three dimensions.

on the other hand, the triviality of hawking radiation for  = 0 is apparently due

to the fact that the test eld does not see the dilaton. in this case, there may exist an-

other explanation for this triviality of hawking radiation. the constant m in eq. (1) in

the constant dilaton background can not be interpreted as a black hole mass as far as we
take the background metric as ds2 =  r2
to the derivative of the dilaton eld. to make this explicit, the quasilocal mass for the

r2 dr2 since the adm mass is proportional

2 dt2 + 2

asymptotically nonat solution is given by q = qm + r2

2 (r) where q is a conserved

charge along the timelike killing vector  and (r) is a local energy density dened by

l2 re  0(r) [21]. the background energy is chosen as 0(r) =  2r

(r) = 2qm + r2
2 to
be satised with the condition of (r) = 0 for m = 0. then the adm mass for the larger
is given by exactly q(r  ) = m
for  = 1, while it becomes zero for the constant
dilaton background case of  = 0. therefore, in two dimensions, the nontrivial ads black



10

hole solution seems to be accompanied with the nontrivial dilaton solution. this implies

that for the case of  = 0, the parameter m in the metric eq. (1) may be removed by

using some coordinate transformations, which is in fact given by y = 2lem
where
y describes our vacuum geometry (m = 0) of ds2 =  4l2
(y+y)2 dy+dy in the conformal
coordinate while  = t  r does the metric eq. (1). the tortoise coordinate r is dened
r+rh(cid:17). therefore, one can think that the two-dimensional ads
by r = r

black hole and vacuum in some sense belong to the equivalent class if the dilaton is not

involved where the global dierence between them is rigorously studied very recently in ref.

[22]. (note that for the dilaton coupled case of  = 1, the above coordinate transformation

is also possible, however, the dilaton eld in the new coordinate contains the information of

the ads black hole.) therefore the parameter m turns out to be a coordinate artifact for

 = 0, and it seems to be meaningless to interpret it as a black hole mass in our calculation.
