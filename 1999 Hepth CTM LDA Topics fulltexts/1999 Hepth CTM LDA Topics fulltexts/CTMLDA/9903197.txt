(in general, description good lfft.) however becomes rapidly dicult include higher fock states. diculty leads idea eective hamiltonians {$9708054$} include eects higher fock states. problem approach eective hamiltonians obtained perturbatively. particular, considered include innitely many fock states. (2) previous paper  theta vacuum massive schwinger model, shown vacuum polarization eects important low-energy physics. therefore natural consider eects calculations meson states even absence theta. another important point previous work vacuum polarization approximately represented intermediate meson states obtained (two-body) bound state equation. order make idea concrete possible, consider massive schwinger model example. next section, review perturbative tamm-danco trans- formation  apply massive schwinger model. sec. 3, obtain self- consistent rpa bound state equation. sec. 4, numerically solve equation. nal section devoted conclusion discussions. ii. perturbative tamm-dancoff transformation order make bound state calculation tractable, necessary make hamil- tonian diagonal particle number space. previous paper , eliminate particle-number-changing interactions perturbatively similarity transformation. al- though originally proposed resolve sector-dependent counterterm problem lf tamm-danco approximation , also useful massive schwinger model, ultraviolet divergence occurs. consider hamiltonian h form, h = h0 + w + gv (2.1) 2 (h0)mn = mmn. interaction w change particle number v does. parameters g organize perturbation theory. put = g = 1 end. eliminate particle-number-changing interaction perturbatively following similarity transformation, hef f = eirheir (2.2) hef f required diagonal particle number. operator r expanded power series g , second order g, obtain following eective hamiltonian, r = gr1 + g2r2 + gt1 + . hef f = h + g2h, 1 1 (h)mn = 2 xk (cid:18) k + 1 n k(cid:19) vmkvkn. (2.3) (2.4) (2.5) although eective hamiltonian rather simple, however gets complicated beyond second-order perturbation theory. furthermore, perturbative construc- tion enough control non-perturbative dynamics. example, know treat non-perturbative divergences occur diagonalization, except resummation use running coupling constant. case massive schwinger model, however, ultraviolet divergences and, seen next section, generalize interactions (at least partially) include non-perturbative eects. massive schwinger model, eective interactions h q q sector may diagrammatically represented fig. 1. iii. self-consistent rpa bound state equation massive schwinger model among eective interactions, particularly interested coulomb inter- action vacuum polarization included. ref. , showed vacuum polarization eects important low-energy physics. therefore natural include eect (i.e., charge shielding) bound state calculations. note approximation essentially equivalent so-called random phase approximation (rpa) many-body problems. here, however, bit further. ref. , re- place vacuum polarization approximate complete set meson states. simple calculation gives following replacement, (2)e2klkl(k + l k l) (2)e2klkl(k + l k l) (k k)2 xn |gv (n)|2 e2 2 1 + 1 1 1 (k k)2 (k k)2 1 m2 + 2 (ll)2 n 3 + 1 m2 kk + 2 (kk)2 n (3.1) , 1 gv (n) = r 1 0 dxn(x) n(x) wave function n-th meson mass n.

(3.4) 1. screening factor depends momentum transfer (x y) individual momenta fermion antifermion. x-dependent terms scale simple way. makes analysis equation complicated. 2. equation (3.2) self-consistent one, solve iteratively next section. important note that, although started two-body bound state equation (3.4), bound state equation (3.2) contains eects innitely many fock states self-consistency. 3. although equation (3.2) self-consistent one, usual hartree-fock approximation wave function specic state included. equation requires information meson states. usual rpa ei- ther, perturbative vacuum polarization diagrams (rings) summed self-consistency required. 4. 0 < < 1. course physically means electric charge screened due vacuum polarization. eective charge reduces momentum dependent way. 5. screening factor included usual coulomb term also so-called self-induced inertia term, z 1 0 dy 1 (x y)2!

(3.6) since screening factor positive, eigenvalue 2 must positive. include screening factor self-induced inertia term, would positivity 2. 6. zero-momentum-transfer limit (x y) 0, screening factor becomes mo- mentum independent, i.e., s({n},{n}, m, x, y) (1 +xn |gv (n)|2 n )1 2 . (3.7) factor pn |gv (n)|2/2 n one encountered ref. . 7. wave function (x) hooft-bergkno equation (3.4) denite meaning two-body amplitude respect free fermion antifermion. wave function (x) equation (3.2) clear meaning contains contribution higher fock states. roughly speaking, however, could considered two-body amplitude respect dressed (constituent) fermion antifermion. iv. numerical solution section, numerically solve bound state equation (3.2). unfortunately, however, unable nd useful set basis functions  enable us calculate hamiltonian matrix elements analytically. instead, use naive discretization equation. claim numerical results present section accurate. rather emphasize equation gives reasonably small correction corresponding solution hooft-bergkno equation therefore equation could starting point improvements. method extremely simple. discretize range x, , n + 1 pieces, impose boundary condition wave function, (0) = (1) = 0. thus equation becomes n n matrix eigenvalue equation. rst solve 1, use result calculate screening factor next calculation. way, iteratively solve equation solution becomes self-consistent. calculations done n = 2000. stop iteration dierence subsequent wavefunctions becomes less = 1.0 1012, z 1 0 dx|new(x) old(x)|2 < . (4.1) typical number iterations 4. general, convergence slower smaller fermion masses. 5 first compare results without vacuum polarization. fig. 3 shows meson mass calculated iteratively new bound state equation deviates one obtained hooft-bergkno equation. see systematic improvement, almost independent ne equations discretized. small fermion masses < 0.2, singular behavior wavefunction edges, even result without vacuum polarization depends n, therefore results trusted. see fig. 4 copmarison result obtained basis function method  accurate small fermion masses. however emphasize modication due vacuum polarization ruin spectrum leads reasonable correction. trivial modication essentially nonlinear depends eigenvalues well eigenstates. this, together valence dominance lf massive schwinger model , gives consistent picture modication vacuum polarization correctly reects (small) eects higher fock states. next compare wavefunctions. seen fig. 5, meson wavefunction new equation less singular edges (x 0 x 1). emphasized earlier , apparently sum geometrical series calculations without vacuum polarization. regularization. summing geometrical series, numerically found state whose wavefunction odd x 1 x becomes lightest one fermion mass small. seems 1 1 2 xn |gv (n)|2 1 n + (xy)2m2 2 xy + 1 n + (xy)2m2 2 (1x)(1y) (4.2) becomes small 0. unable give positive interpretation lightest state wavefunction odd x 1 x, thus think artefact. fact, odd lightest state occurs < 0.1, results trusted because, remarked earlier, discretization cannot represent correct endpoint behavior wave function, important correct spectrum. emphasized new bound state equation contains information meson states. however dominated lowest meson state eectively reduces much simpler one. namely, numerically nd sum screening factor (3.3) strongly dominated rst term. fact reduces cpu time considerably. table i, compare reduced calculation full one. v. summary discussions paper, developed self-consistent rpa new eective hamiltonian method lfft. method applied massive schwinger model generalization hooft-bergkno equation obtained, eectively includes contributions innitely many fock states. numerically solved found modication, i.e., inclusion vacuum polarization, leads reasonable small corrections. hope new bound state equation becomes starting point elaborate approximations. following, would like discuss several aspects new bound state equation. 6 shown rst-oder coecient m1 expansion meson mass squared terms fermion mass, 2(m) = 1 + m1m + m2m2 + , (5.1) cannot improved even variational space systematically extended . later, dalley suggested endpoint behavior wave function may change eects higher fock states correctly. (it assumed endpoint behavior solely determined two-body sector .) coecient closely related endpoint behavior, hoped so-called 2% discrepancy disappear correct endpoint behavior taken account. since new bound state equation contains eects higher fock states, natural ask dalleys suggestion correct quantitatively. small fermion masses, looks legitimate approximate screening factor following way, s({n},{n}, m, x, y) (1 + |gv (1)|2 2 1 )1 , (5.2) 1 = meson mass gv (1) = r 1 becomes 0 dx(x), bound state equation 2(x) = m2 x(1 x) (x) +z 1 0 dx(x) + sz 1 0 dy ((x) (y)) (x y)2 . estimate coecient m1 using ansatz (5.3) (5.4) (x) = x(1 x), 2(1 + o(m)), nd m1 = 2/6 = 2.56510 compared = 1 value hooft-bergkno equation, 2/3 = 3.62760 correct value, 2e = 3.56125. although considerably small, important shifts value hooft-bergkno equation. conceivable approximation employed naive elaborate calculation would give much better value. fact, approximation (the limit (5.2)) legitimate, nite m, however tiny, term fermion mass negligible x < 1/m2. present, unable extract useful information endpoint behavior subtlety. numerical results previous section may suggest eects higher fock states would solve 2% discrepancy, though present numerical method crude correctly calculate meson mass small fermion mass region. although included eects vacuum polarization eective interaction, similarity transformation point view, kind eective interactions. ensure invariance eigenvalues (meson masses) addition eective interactions, necessary transformation unitary. is, add interactions fig. 1 too. paper, assumed eects interactions small. cheat: self-energy diagram vacuum polarization infrared divergent. presumably, infrared divergences cancel calculation meson spectrum. (some authors also assumed cancellation .) however 7 unable pin point cancellation occurs. note cancellation infrared divergences would dierent scattering processes. qed, example, positronium neutral particle nite size, cannot couple soft photons, play important role cancellation infrared divergences scattering processes. finally, give comments outlook. 1. course interesting extend present formulation realistic four-dimensional models. working direction. 2. interesting note new equation self-consistent one spontaneous-symmetry-breaking point view. hope similar setting would leads useful framework vacuum problem lfft. 3. vacuum polarization inside meson also important presence theta. solves several puzzles concerning theta. work progress. acknowledgments author would like thank t. heinzl discussions early stage investigation. grateful y. yamamoto, m. taniguchi, k. inoue discussions, especially ir property, o. abe discussion 2% discrepancy work, y. r. shimizu, s.-i. ohtsubo, k. itakura, discussions mainly many-body techniques. also grateful m. burkardt comments discussions case theta. 8
