abstract

we present unique solutions of the seiberg-witten monopole equations
in which the u (1) curvature is covariantly constant, the monopole weyl
spinor consists of a single constant component, and the 4-manifold is a
product of two riemann surfaces of genuses p1 and p2. there are p1  1
magnetic vortices on one surface and p2 1 electric ones on the other, with
p1 + p2  2 (p1 = p2 = 1 being excluded). when p1 = p2, the electromag-
netic elds are self-dual and one also has a solution of the coupled euclidean
einstein-maxwell-dirac equations, with the monopole condensate serving
as cosmological constant. the metric is decomposable and the electromag-
netic elds are covariantly constant as in the bertotti-robinson solution.
the einstein metric can also be derived from a kahler potential satisfying
the monge-amp`ere equations.

1. introduction:

four-dimensional manifolds of euclidean signature are of interest in physics

for semiclassical treatments of vacuum tunnelling and for their contributions to

the path integral of quantum gravity. in such a physical context, one might start

by trying to solve einsteins equations in the presence of some chosen set of matter

sources, together with eld equations (adapted to the background metric) for the

matter elds. in mathematics, on the other hand, four dimensions are unique in

hosting innitely many manifolds that are homeomorphic but not dieomorphic

to each other. the most ecient approach for classifying such manifolds involves

the seiberg-witten monopole equations (swme)[1]

[, ] .

(2)

in (1) and (2) a is the u(1) connection and f +

 is the self-dual part of f =

a a; the covariant dirac operator also involves the spin connection of the
4-manifold m4. for a pedagogical review of the swme, we refer the reader to
[2]. the equations stem from an n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory which

is rst twisted into a topological quantum eld theory (tqft) [3] and then

has its gauge symmetry broken down spontaneously from su(2) to u(1). for

the particular choice of higgs vacuum used in the swme, the classical monopole

solutions, represented by the weyl spinor , become massless, which is why a

2

mass term is absent in (1).

in the mathematical study of 4-manifolds, the focus is usually on global ques-

tions (e.g. topological invariants, the moduli space of a class of solutions etc.)

rather than explicit local solutions of the swme. however, it is instructive to

derive from the swme, in actual local form, a solution whose global properties

are known. another reason for searching for local solutions is the possibility that

some of these may represent congurations of physical signicance, which may

then indicate new connections between the topology of 4-manifolds and physics.

in particular, it is important to note that there are two swme equations for three

elds; the fact that the metric is not constrained by a third equation is of course

consistent with the topological nature of the sw system. if one were to consider

a physical equation for the metric, the obvious candidate would of course be

einsteins eld equations in the presence of a maxwell and a dirac (or, rather,

weyl) eld. to make the system completely physical, maxwells equations would

also have to be added, resulting in an overdetermined system because of (2).

lebrun [4] has in fact recently considered manifolds simultaneously obeying the

swme and einsteins equations with a cosmological term without the energy-

momentum tensors of the maxwell and dirac elds on the rhs; we will see in a

specic example below how and when this can be justied.

remarkably, a set of solutions to this overconstrained system exist as reported

briey in [5]. one of the purposes of the present paper is to exhibit their deriva-

3

tion in detail; but we start with our more general swme solutions of which the

physical ones are a special subset: the 4-manifold m4 is a product of two rie-
mann surfaces p1 and p2, where the genuses p1 and p2 must satisfy p1 + p2  2,
excluding p1 = p2 = 1. the weyl spinor  consists of a single constant compo-

nent 1 or 2, which may be interpreted as a monopole condensate. it is worth

remarking that in the closely related physical seiberg-witten theory [6] based

on an untwisted n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in at minkowski

space, precisely such a condensate leads to quark connement, while a gluino

condensate, possibly dual to the monopole one, is considered in [3]. physically,

p1  1 (p2  1) is the number of magnetic (electric) vortices in p1 (p2).

interestingly, it is the most symmetric special case (with self-dual electro-

magnetic elds) of the above swme solutions that solves the coupled einstein-

maxwell-dirac equations, with the condensate now serving as the cosmological

constant. the solution is reminiscent of the bertotti-robinson one [7], [8] in

that the metric is decomposable and the electromagnetic elds are covariantly

constant. however, the euclidean signature and the spinor (not the cosmological

constant, which is present in [7]) are new features. the presence of the spinor

in particular provides a counterexample to the folk-theorem that one need not

seek solutions of the coupled einstein-maxwell-dirac equations since the dirac

eld supposedly becomes negligible in the classical limit where the eld equations

apply.

4

the plan of the paper is as follows. in section 2, we describe the ansatz for the

swme, which are then reduced to a pair of liouville equations. in section 3, we

discuss the behavior of the ansatz under gauge transformations. the solutions,

which are expressed in terms of fuchsian functions, are classied and presented in

section 4. we compute the topological numbers of the solutions in section 5, and

using these, prove their uniqueness by showing that the virtual dimension of the

moduli space of solutions is zero. in section 6, we show that the special self-dual

swme solution is the only one which also satises the einstein-maxwell-dirac

equations. in section 7, the kahler form of the metric and the monge-amp`ere

equation satised by the kahler potential are given. section 8 ends the paper

with concluding remarks.

2. an ansatz based on m(1)

:

a central tool in seiberg-witten theory of 4-manifolds is the weitzenbock for-

mula obtained by squaring 6da in (1); together with (2), it can be shown to imply
that 4-manifolds with everywhere non-negative scalar curvatures cannot admit

non-singular solutions. integrating the same formula, witten derived vanishing

theorems showing that the solutions for non-negative curvature are not only

singular, but also non-square integrable. thus we expect that at least one of the

two riemann surfaces will have genus p  2; if one surface is the two-sphere, the
curvature of the higher genus surface must be suciently large and negative to

make the overall scalar curvature negative. this expectation will be explicitly

5

veried by the computation that follows.

we start with the conformally at basis 1-forms

ei = edxi,  = (x1, x2), i = 1, 2; ej = edxj,  = (x3, x4), j = 3, 4

(3)

2

and m(2)

for m(1)
u(1) connection

2 , respectively. we also choose the similarly decomposable

a = (a1(x1, x2), a2(x1, x2), a3(x3, x4), a4(x3, x4)),

(4)

while the spinor t = (1, 2, 0, 0) is initially assumed to depend on all four

coordinates. the cartan structure equations yield the spin-connection 1-forms

12 = 2 dx1  1 dx2, 34 = 4 dx3  3 dx4

with all other components vanishing. of the curvature 2-forms

the only non-zero ones then are

(7)

and

r3
4 = (33 + 44) dx3  dx4 = [(33 + 44)]e2 e3  e4.

(8)

we dene the curved-index -matrices via

 = ae
a ,

(9)

where e

a eb

 = a

b . hence

e1 = e1, e2 = e2, e3 = e3, e4 = e4.

(10)

we use the at space -matrices

1 = 1  1 =   0 1
3 = 1  3 =   0 3
5  4123 =   1

the explicit form of the dirac equation thus becomes

6da  ae

a ( + ia +

 [b, c]) = 0,

while (2) reduces to the three equations

2f +

12 = 1a2  2a1 + (3a4  4a3)e2() = e2(|1|2  |2|2),

12 + 21 = i( 21  12) = 0

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

since f13 = f24 = f23 = f14 = 0. in component form, (12) reads

(16)

equation (14) shows we must set either 1 or 2 equal to zero. let us start with

2 = 0. then (13) becomes

(1a2  2a1)e2 + (3a4  4a3)e2) = |1|2.

(17)

7

now, the rst term in (17) is a function of (x1, x2) and the second of (x3, x4).

the simplest choice for the rhs compatible with this splitting is

1 = (x1, x2) + i(x3, x4),

where  and  are real functions. putting (18) in (15) and (16) then gives

or

and hence

[ia3  a4 + (

a3 =

2

4 , a4 =

1

3 ,

(3 + i4) = 0.

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

now since  is real by (18), (21) does not mean  is a holomorphic function; in

fact, it can only be a real constant. using (20), we then have

f34 =

1
2

(33 + 44).

a similar analysis of (16) gives

a1 = 

1
2

4 , a2 =

1

3 ,

(1 + i2) = 0,

f12 =

1
2

(11 + 22).

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

thus  is also a real constant. putting these back in (17), we nd

e2(11 + 22) + e2(33 + 44) = 2(2 +  2),

(26)

8

or, comparing with (7) and (8),

r = 2r12

12 + 2r34

34 = 2(2 +  2) = 2|1|2.

(27)

we thus see that the ricci curvature r of the manifold m4 is a negative constant
and non-singular solutions are allowed. we can satisfy (26) and (27) by setting

e2(11 + 22) = 2||2 = 2r12

12

e2(11 + 22) = 2(|1|2  ||2) = 2r34
34,

(28)

(29)

where we have introduced another constant ||. the options for m(1)
are now related to the values of || and |1| in the following way:

2 and m(2)

2

(i) both manifolds have constant negative curvature if |1| > || 6= 0.
(ii) m(1)
(iii) m(2)
(iv) m(1)

2 has zero and m(2)
2 has zero and m(1)
2 has constant negative and m(2)

2 has negative curvature if || = 0.
2 has negative curvature if || = |1|.

2 has constant positive curvature if

|1| < ||.

at this point, it is advantageous to go over to the two pairs of dimensionless

coordinates (x, y)  2||(x1, x2) and (s, t)  2(|1|2  ||2)1/2(x3, x4) and

then to dene their complex combinations

z1  x + iy,

z2  s + it.

one can now rewrite (28) and (29) as the pair of liouville equations

411 = e2,

9

(30)

(31)

422 = e2 (|1|

>

< ||).

(32)

cases (i) and (iv) are represented by equation (31) combined with the upper and

lower sign versions of (32), respectively. for case (ii) we have the pair of equations

11 = 0,

422 = e2,

while case (iii) is described by the pair

411 = e2,

22 = 0.

3. gauge invariance of the ansatz:

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

before considering explicit parametrizations of m(1)

2 and m(2)

2 based on so-

lutions of (31)  (36), let us investigate the eect of the u(1) transformation

1  exp(i(x, y, s, t))1

(37)

on (15), (16), (17). the transformation (37) is admitted by the rhs of (17), hence

one may wonder whether it leads to new and independent solutions through (19),

(20) and (23). the answer is that it does not; the transformation

a  a  

accompanying (37) is forced to have the special form

 = (x, y) + (s, t)

10

(38)

(39)

by the swme; hence the special form of a in equation (4) of the ansatz is

preserved. this can be shown most easily by using the complex combinations

s + it = 22, as + iat = 2a2, etc. after setting 2 = 0 and applying (37),

equations (15) and (16) become

(22 + 2 + 2ia2 + 2i2)1 = 0

and

(21 + 1 + 2ia1 + 2i1)1 = 0.

recalling that 1 =  + i and ,  are both real constants, it follows that

and

i2 = ia2 

1

2

i1 = ia1

1,

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

which can only hold if  has the form (39) (recall that since  is real, we cannot

add a function holomorphic in z1 and z2 to it). this is of course because a1 =

a1(z1, z1),  = (z1, z1) and a2 = a2(z2, z2),  = (z2, z2). thus the ansatz is

only compatible with gauge transformations of the form (39), which corresponds

to having separate u(1) bers over each of the two-manifolds. interestingly, (42)

and (43) partly realize the original version of h. weyls eichinvarianz [9], which

was meant to x the form of the electromagnetic coupling by demanding that eld

equations transform covariantly under local conformal transformations.

11

4. solutions of the form p1  p2 :
4.1 cases (ii) and (iii): these are described by the equations (33)(36). both

represent the same solution with one at surface and one surface of constant

negative curvature; they can be transformed ino each other by   , z1  z2.
it will thus suce to consider, say, only (33) and (34), which we now do.

we may start by taking  as the real part of an analytic function (z1). the

resulting metric for m(1)

2

is then of the form

ds2(m(1)

2 ) = exp((z1) + (z1))dz1dz1

(44)

which can be attened by going over to the coordinate z1(z1) = r exp (z1)dz1.
m(1)
function, tesellating the z1 plane into parallelograms.

can then be turned into a at torus by choosing z1(z1) as an inverse elliptic

2

a similar procedure can be eected on the one-sheeted constant negative

curvature hyperboloid stereographically projected onto the complex g2(z2) plane

via liouvilles [10] solution to (34), which reads

 =

1
2

ln

4| dg2
dz2|2

(1  g2g2)2

(45)

at this point, g(z2) is an arbitrary analytic function. we have therefore the

familiar kleinian metric for m(2)
2 :

ds2(m(1)

2 ) = e2 dz2 dz2 =

dg2dg2

(1  g2g2)2

(46)

12

one can of course also put the metric into the poincare form

ds2(m(2)

2 ) =

df2df2
(imf2)2

(47)

via g2(z2) = (f2i)

(f2+i) which maps the interior of the circle |g2(z2)|2 = 1 to the
upper-half f -plane c+. if one now chooses f2(z2) as the fuchsian function used

in uniformizing an algebraic function whose riemann surface has genus p2 [11], c+

gets tesellated into 4p2-gons with geodesic edges and the manifold m(2)
the riemann surface p2 of genus p2 when the edges are identied in the standard

2 becomes

way described in, say, [12]. for explicit parametrizations of fuchsian functions

we refer the reader to [13].

to summarize, the 4-manifolds for cases (ii) and (iii) are of the form (1 
t 2)  p, p  2. setting the rst two components of a which are pure gauge
equal to zero, the solution for case (ii) becomes

a =

in order to obtain the corresponding formulae for case (iii) we simply switch the

4.2 case (i):

13

the pair of liouville equations (31) and (32) (with the upper sign on the

rhs) correspond to the 4-manifold p1  p2 (p1, p2  2), where the scalar
curvature of the riemann surfaces are 2||2 and 2(|1|2  ||2), respectively.

(62)

in spite of the apparent similarity between the solutions of this section and the

previous one, there is one very important dierence: since m(2)
not a fuchsian function; in fact it can only be

2 = s2, g2(z2) is

g2(z2) =

az2 + b
cz2 + d

,

(63)

which represents the most general one-to-one mappings of s2 to itself. finally,

it is easy to show that the solutions in all the cases are entirely invariant under

transformations of the form

gi =

gi + 
gi + 

,   +,

i = 1, 2,

(64)

where the upper (lower) sign applies in the negative (positive) curvature cases.

by this we mean that not only curvatures but even the connection 1-forms ab

and a remain unchanged. thus the case (i) is invariant under su(1, 1)su(1, 1),
where both g1(z1) and g2(z2) are subjected to (64). the cases (ii)(iii) and (iv)

have invariance groups su(1, 1) and su(1, 1)  su(2), respectively. when one
passes from the klein form (40) to the poincare form (41) of the hyperboloid

15

metric, (64) (upper sign) is replaced by

fi =

afi + b
cfi + d

, ab  cd = 1,

(65)

where a, b, c, d are all real numbers. this is of course sl(2, r) rather than

su(1, 1). the sl(2, z) subgroup of sl(2, r) shues 4p-gons of the tesellation

amongst themselves; invariance under this integer subgroup ensures that one has

the same solution in each domain.

5. topological numbers and the uniqueness of the solution:

for a 4-dimensional manifold m4, the signature  is given by [14]

(m4) = 

1

242 zm4

ra
b  rb
a.

(66)

for the solutions considered here, the only non-vanishing components of ra

bcd are

r1

212 and r3

434; hence  trivially vanishes in all the cases (i)(iv).

the euler characteristic is most easily computed from the kunneth formula

(m4) = (m(1)

2 )(m(2)

2 ) = (2  2p1)(2  2p2).

finally, we must evaluate

c2
1 =

1

(2)2 zm4

f 2,

where, as in (56) and (62), we can write

f = 

1
2

(r1

2 + r3
4)

and then use (67) and the gauss-bonnet theorem to obtain

c2
1 =

1
2

(m4).

16

(67)

(68)

(69)

(70)

then, using the notation and conventions of [1], the virtual dimension w of the

moduli space dened by

w = 

(2 + 3)

4

+ c2

1 = 0

(71)

is seen to vanish. thus the solutions of the type p1  p2 are unique up to u(1)
transformations in the bundle and conformal changes of the metrics.

6. a self-dual solution of the einstein-maxwell-dirac equations:

the similarities between the solutions of the swme considered so far and

the bertotti-robinson solution (covariantly constant electromagnetic elds on a

product of two two-manifolds) suggest that some of the eld congurations found

so far may satisfy the einstein-maxwell-dirac eld equations

gr = (t(e.m.) + t(dirac)) + g,

f 
; = j

el. =  ,

f

mag. =  5.

(72)

(73)

(74)

the dirac equation, already satised by our solutions, (1) completes the system

of coupled equations our three interacting elds have to obey. using a weyl

spinor in euclidean signature (which is why the usual s are replaced by s)

immediately gives

and

  =  5 = 0

t(dirac) =

i
2

[d   (d)] = 0

17

(75)

(76)

because the  are block o-diagonal while the covariant derivative is block di-

agonal. taking the trace of both sides of (72) yields

or, using (27),

r = 4,

 = |1|2
2

= constant,

(77)

(78)

showing that the masless monopole condensate provides a cosmological constant.

now we know that f is covariantly constant for all our swme solutions,

i.e.,

df = d f = 0

and that these are consistent with (73), (74) and (75); we however must still

satisfy the by now considerably simplied einstein eld equations

r 

1
2

gr = t(e.m.) + g.

this is most easily accomplished by imposing

f = f =

1
2

f 

which can be seen to hold when

||2 =

1
2||2

(80)

(81)

(82)

by going back to (22), (25), (28) and (29). this means not only f but the whole

solution is self-dual in the sense that the manifolds m(1)

2 and m(2)

2 are identical!

furthermore, explicit calculation, both analytical and by using reduce, shows

that none of our other swme solutions obeys (72) - (74).

7. kahler structure and relation to the monge-amp`ere equations:

in the complex coordinates za(a = 1, 2) the metric gab of m4 can be obtained

from the kahler potential

u =  +  =

1
2

ln

g

1g

1g

2g

2

(1  g1g1)2(1  g2g2)2

through the kahler form

k =

i
2

gabdza  dzb =

i
2

u.

(83)

(84)

now it is known [14] that if a kahler potential u satises the monge-amp`ere

equations

( u )  ( u ) = exp 2 u dz1  dz1  dz2  dz2,

(85)

then the metric for u dened via (84) solves einsteins equations with cosmolog-

ical constant ; in particular, the weyl tensor is self-dual. the metric in (84)

can be related to (85) by choosing

u =

1
2

(2u  3 ln 2).

(86)

note that  is dimensionless in the dimensionless coordinates used in (83-86); it

can of course always be scaled back together with the coordinates to the value

 = |1|2
2

in (78). the liouville equations (31) and (32) then guarantee (85).

19

the weyl tensor is self-dual in the trivial sense that all its components vanish.

8. concluding remarks:

one might wonder what would have happened had we chosen the other com-

ponent of the weyl spinor to vanish in (15) and (16). going through the formulae,

it is not dicult to see that complex variables are replaced by their conjugates,

leading to a sign change in the electromagnetic potential, while the metric re-

mains unchanged. recalling that two components of the weyl spinor correspond

to particles and antiparticles, we see that the new solution is just the charge

conjugate of the original one. we now have an antimonopole condensate and the

sense of the vortices is reversed.

it is worth emphasizing here some surprisingly general facts about weyl

spinors and u(1) connections on a 4-manifold of euclidean signature. as noted

in section 6, (75) and (76) automatically hold. if, in addition, one imposes self-

duality on the f, einsteins equations are immediately reduced to the dening

equation for an einstein space and, although not explicitly stated by lebrun, this

is what allows one to consider einstein spaces in a sw setting without having to

take maxwells equations and matter tensors into account. since there is nothing

else available, the sw equations then force an identication of the cosmologi-

cal constant with the monopole condensate. the physical picture is astonishing,

at least to the author, in that weyl spinors and self-dual u(1) gauge elds can

seemingly live on an einstein manifold of euclidean signature without having

20

any other eect on the metric whatsoever! interestingly, this also saturates the

lhs of (2) by forcing the curvature to be purely self-dual.
