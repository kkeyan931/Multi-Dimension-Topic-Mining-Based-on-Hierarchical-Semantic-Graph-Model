abstract

we study the perturbation expansion of the free energy of n = 4 supersymmetric
su (n ) yang-mills at nite temperature in powers of t hoofts coupling g2n in the
large n limit. infrared divergences are controlled by constructing a hierarchy of two 3
dimensional eective eld theories. this procedure is applied to the calculation of the
free energy to order (g2n )3/2, but it can be extended to higher order corrections.

in recent years some light has been shed on understanding the relation between string
theory and gauge theories [1]. a particularly interesting system is n coincident, parallel
d3-branes. this system realizes n = 4 supersymmetric u(n) yang-mills in its world vol-
ume (4 dimensions). in the large n limit, the 3-brane system becomes a black brane whose
bekenstein-hawking entropy can be obtained by considering ramond-ramond charged 3-
brane classical solutions [2]. it is therefore interesting to compare the 3-brane thermodynam-
ics with that of n = 4 supersymmetric u(n) yang-mills. the free energy density of n = 4
supersymmetric u(n) yang-mills in the ideal gas approximation is fideal = 2n 2t 4/6. on
the other hand, the free energy of a black 3-brane was found to be [2] fbh = (3/4)  fideal.
maldacenas conjecture [3] helps to understand the relative factor 3/4 between fideal and
fbh. the conjecture relates type iib superstrings on ads5  s5 to n = 4 supersymmetric
su(n) yang-mills in 4 dimensions and allows to compute the next-to-leading order correc-
tion to fbh in the strong coupling limit [4],

where  = g2n is the t hooft coupling. f ()  f /fideal should be interpreted as a function
whose strong coupling limit is f () = 3/4, while the weak limit is f (0) = 1. it has been
suggested that f () is a monotonic function that interpolates between the strong and the
weak coupling limits [1, 4].

we will explore the weak coupling limit of n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills
(sym for short) in 4 dimensions at nite temperature (3 space dimensions). in the present
note, we will carry out the calculation of f () up to order 3/2 by using the eective eld
theory approach at nite temperature [5, 6]. related work can be found in [7] and [8, 9], where
the terms of order  and 3/2 have also been computed, respectively, but using approaches
dierent from ours.

feynman rules at nite t are the same as those at t = 0 except that loops involve innite
sums over fourier modes [10]. the thermodynamic properties of n = 4 supersymmetric
su(n) yang-mills in 4 dimensions, in thermal equilibrium are described by the free energy
density f = t log z/v , where z is the partition function and v is the 3d volume of the
system, which is taken to innity in the thermodynamic limit. the partition function can
be written as a path integral over the elds of the lagrangian l that describes sym. fields
are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, the gauge coupling is g. an expansion
for t log z/v in powers of the coupling constant g can be obtained by summing up the
vacuum feynman diagrams that contribute at a given order in g.
the infrared (ir) behavior of eld theories at nite t however prevents us from computing
the free energy density in the form just described. there are two sources of ir divergences.
first, some elds that are massless at t = 0, become massive at t 6= 0 with a mass of
order gt . diagrams with self-energy insertions have ir divergences that do not cancel order
by order in the coupling constant. a second source of ir divergences, which is specic to
non-abelian gauge theories, has to do with the gauge eld self-interaction terms.

the eective eld theory approach allows to remove systematically the ir divergences
associated to thermal mass insertions. also, ir divergences related with the gauge eld
self-coupling terms are isolated and interpreted as a source of non-perturbative eects [11].

in the eective eld theory approach for gauge theories, a hierarchy of two eective eld
theories in 3 dimensions which only contain static modes are constructed. since, in addition,
these eective eld theories do not contain fermionic elds, they are very convenient for
non-perturbative studies on the lattice [5].3

if non-static modes are integrated out in the partition function z, we can write

z =z da0(x)dai(x)di(x) er d3xle ,

(2)

where le is an eective lagrangian compatible with the internal symmetries of l. le
describes a 3 dimensional eective eld theory [17]. le is made out of an electrostatic eld
a0(x), a magnetostatic gauge eld ai(x), and 6 scalars i(x), where i = 1, . . . , 6. these
elds can be identied, up to eld redenitions, with the static modes of their 4 dimensional
counterparts. note that fermion elds have been integrated out completely because they do
not have a static mode. we can write le = fe +lesym, where fe is a constant that cannot
be ignored when computing the free energy. lesym contains the remaining terms and has
the form

j is the magnetostatic eld strength with gauge coupling

out of a0(x), ai(x), and i(x) that contribute only at order higher than 3/2. lesym
contains non-renormalizable interaction terms. we call the eective theory constructed by
integrating out non-static modes electrostatic sym (esym). the free energy can be written
as f = t (fe  log zesym/v ), where

zesym =z da0(x)dai(x)di(x) er d3x lesym .

we can go a step further by integrating out a0(x), and i(x) in (4). we obtain

3several theories at nite temperature have been studied perturbatively and non-perturbatively using the
eective eld theory approach. the 4-theory is studied in [6], qcd in [12, 11], qed in [13], and scalar
qed in [14]. the electroweak phase transition has been studied in the standard model [5, 15] and in some
of the minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model [16].

where

we may think of using (7) to compute the free energy density of sym. we need to
determine fe, the eective parameters of lesym, fm , and the eective parameters of lmsym.
the term fe and the eective parameters of lesym may be determined by computing the
same physical quantities in both the full theory (sym) and in the eective eld theory
described by le (esym) and comparing the result. at rst sight this procedure may seem
useless if we consider that to compute physical quantities in the full theory we have to remove
the ir divergences. it is like having to face the very same problem we wanted to solve at the
beginning. however, to compare results, it is actually enough to compute them in a region
where we know that both theories describe the same physics.

as mentioned above, self-energy insertions of order gt in the full theory give rise to ir
divergences. if we introduce an ir momentum cuto e, we will obtain physical quantities
as expansions in powers of gt /e. the expansion diverges when e goes to zero. however,
if we demand e  gt , the expansion makes sense. of course, the result depends on e and
one cannot get rid of it unless an innite number of diagrams are summed up. in the eective
theory, the thermal masses (me and ms) are also of order gt (we will explicitly see it below).
therefore, an ir momentum cuto e  gt is equivalent to treating the mass terms in
le as interaction terms. by computing physical quantities in this way and comparing the
results, we are able to determine the parameters of the eective theory (esym) as functions
of t , g, and e  gt .
once we have determined the parameters of esym by matching, we can use esym as an
ordinary eld theory. in general, when computing diagrams using esym, we will encounter
ultraviolet (uv) divergences. these uv divergences can be regulated by introducing a uv
momentum cuto . moreover, esym is not fully free of ir divergences.
in order to
regulate the ir divergences originated by the gauge boson self-interaction terms in esym,
we have to introduce an ir momentum cuto m . analogously to what happened to the
full theory with ir cuto e, we can make sense of the perturbative expansion of esym
only if m  g2t [10, 18]. note that the uv cuto of esym has to satisfy   m . since
e  gt and m  g2t , we can think of e as e  t and m as m  gt . therefore,
we can take e as the ultraviolet cuto of esym:  = e. the e dependence of the
parameters is canceled by the e dependence of the loop integrals in esym.

we see from (6) that msym is a pure gauge theory in 3 dimensions. it is a conning
theory that cannot be studied perturbatively. its feynman diagrams only contain gauge eld
self-interaction terms and one should expect the same ir problems that we have already
pointed out for the full theory and esym. however, if we introduce an ir momentum cuto

3

m  g2t , we can still use a diagrammatic expansion to determine the eective parameters
of msym by matching physical quantities with esym. of course, although we may be
able to determine the eective parameters of msym,  log zmsym/v in (7) has still to be
calculated non-perturbatively.

we write x     to denote that the physical quantity x has been computed using
the ir cutos e or m . an expression of this type for x is suitable for matching but it
should not be confused with a correct perturbative expansion (which should have the ir
divergences removed). the perturbative expansions performed with ir cutos are called
strict perturbation expansions.

so far, we have used momentum cutos to learn how to organize the perturbative ex-
pansion of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills at nite t . however, it turns out to be more
convenient to use a regulator that automatically gets rid of power divergences. such a reg-
ulator is dimensional regularization. we therefore consider the full theory in (3  2) + 1
dimensions. since, in the present note, we are interested in computing the free energy den-
sity of n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills to order 3/2, we limit ourselves to the
eective parameters and corrections that contribute to such an order.
the strict perturbation expansions in the full theory can be greatly simplied if we
consider that n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills in 4 dimensions (sym4) can be obtained by
dimensional reduction of n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills in 10 dimensions [19]. physical
quantities in sym4 can be obtained perturbatively by using sym10 feynman rules while
loop integrals are performed in 4 dimensions (sym104) [8]. in this formulation, the 10d
a ( = 0, 1, 2, 3) can be identied, up to scale redenitions, with the 4d gauge eld a. the
remaining ai+3 (i = 1, . . . , 6) are identied with the 6 scalars i of n = 4 supersymmetric
yang-mills in 4d. while leading order contributions to the strict perturbation expansions in
the full theory can be easily computed using either sym4 or sym104, higher than leading
order contributions are much less arduous in sym104.

the gauge coupling constant of esym, ge, can be read o from the lagrangian of the

full theory. by substituting a0(x,  )  t a0(x) in the lagrangian of sym4 and comparing
r 
0 dlsym with lesym, we nd out, to leading order in g2,

e = g2t .
g2

(9)

in qcd, the gauge invariant electric screening mass is given by the pole location of
the  =  = 0 component of the complete gluon propagator [20]. we will use a sim-
ilar denition in sym. using sym104, the inverse gauge eld propagator has the form
ab [k2 + (0, k)]. in order to compute the static masses in lesym, it is convenient to de-
ne el(k2) and sc(k2) such that 00(0, k)  el(k2) and i+3,j+3(0, k)  ij sc(k2) (i, j =
1, . . . , 6), respectively. calculations are performed in feynman gauge.
the electrostatic mass me is determined by computing the electric screening mass in
the full theory and matching it with the result obtained in esym. the electric screening in
sym is the solution to the equation

k2 + el(k2) = 0

at k2 = m2
el .

note that (10) gives rise to a double expansion in powers of g (or equivalently, in number of
loops) and in powers of m2
el  g2t 2. in the calculation of the free energy to order 3/2, it is
enough to compute el at one-loop order. then, the expression for the electric screening mass
el  (1)
to leading order in g2 is m2
el (0) is given by the graphs
shown in fig. 1(a). these diagrams give rise to sum-integrals that can easily be evaluated
by using standard methods [10]. we nd that, in the full theory, the strict perturbation

in esym, the electric screening mass mel gives the location of the pole in the propagator

at k2 = m2

(12)

similarly to (10), (12) also gives rise to a double expansion in number of loops and in
powers of m2
el  g2t 2. the strict perturbation expansion of me is obtained as an expansion
involving feynman diagrams evaluated at zero external momentum. since me, ms, and
ge are treated as perturbation parameters, there is no energy scale in the dimensionally
regularized integrals and they all vanish. the solution to the equation (12) for the screening
mass is therefore trivial: m2
e. comparing this result with (11), we nd that, to
leading order in g2

e = 2 cag2t 2 .

the calculation of the scalar static mass ms is similar to the calculation of me. we
dene a scalar screening mass msc which satises k2 + sc(k2) = 0 at k2 = m2
sc in the full
theory and an equation analogous to (12) in the eective theory. after comparing the result
in sym with the result in esym, we nd that, to leading order in g2

(14)

the eective parameter fe is evaluated by matching the calculation of the free energy
density in the full theory and in the eective theory. the leading order contribution to the

5

free energy density in the full theory is given by a familiar result from blackbody radiation
f (1)  2t 4/90 (b + 7f /8), where b (f ) is the number of bosonic (fermionic) degrees
of freedom of the theory. in the case of n = 4 sym4, b = f = 8da, where da is the
dimension of the adjoint representation of su(n): da = n 2  1. alternatively, f (1) may
be obtained by computing the one-loop vacuum diagrams of sym4 using sym104. the
next-to-leading order contribution to the free energy density is given by the 2-loop feynman
diagrams shown in fig. 1(b) using sym104. the evaluation of these diagrams involves
elementary sum-integrals that can easily be evaluated by standard methods [10]. adding
the 2-loop order contribution to f (1), we obtain that the strict perturbation expansion of
the free energy density in the full theory is

f

(15)

in esym the eective parameters me, ms, and ge are treated as perturbation param-
eters. then, as there is no scale in the dimensionally regularized integrals, they all vanish.
the strict perturbation expansion of the free energy density is therefore trivial: f  t fe.
comparing this result with (15), fe to order g2 is

fe =

(16)

as a check we have also computed the eective parameters of esym me, ms, and fe using
sym4 instead of sym104 and found the same results given in eqs. (13), (14), and (16).
to determine fm , we have to compute the strict perturbation expansion of  log zesym/v
and compare it with that of fm  log zmsym/v . computing the one-loop vacuum diagrams
of esym, we nd  log zesym/v  da/(12) (m3
s). the eective parameters
of lmsym are treated as perturbation parameters. feynman diagrams give rise to integrals
which have no scale dependence. therefore, using dimensional regularization all the con-
tributions to  log zmsym/v vanish. we have fm  log zmsym/v  fm . comparing this
result with  logzesym/v , we obtain fm :

the gauge coupling constant gm can be read o from the lagrangian of esym lesym. to

the free energy of n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills is given by (7). the term
 log zmsym/v is non-perturbative. it is easy to nd out at which order non-perturbative
corrections become relevant. the only quantity with dimensions in lmsym is g2
m (neglecting
lmsym whose contribution is subleading). since  logzmsym/v has dimension 3 in units of
energy, its lowest order contribution to the free energy is therefore of order g6
m = (g2t )3. we
conclude that the non-perturbative corrections generated by logzmsym/v only contribute
to the free energy of sym at order 3 or higher.
using (7), the free energy of n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills in 4 dimensions

(18)

this result is in agreement with previously reported calculations. in ref. [7], the free
energy was evaluated to order . in [8] and [9], the term of order 3/2 has been computed
by regulating the ir divergences of sym4 by adding and subtracting out thermal masses to
the lagrangian. vazquez-mozo [8] used sym104 to compute the rst two terms in (18).

since the term of order 3/2 in (18) is positive, it seems that our result does not favor a
monotonically decreasing function interpolating between the weak and strong coupling limits.
however, such a behavior may be an eect of the zero convergence radius of the weak-coupling
expansion (18). it has been suggested [21] that there could be a phase transition in  at
large n. even though perturbative calculations cannot settle the debate on this matter, it
may be possible to nd an indication of a phase transition by using pade approximants. an
analysis of (18) using pade approximants has been carried out in [9]. there, an indication
has been found of a smooth interpolation between the weak and strong coupling regimes.

the eective eld theory approach provides a systematic way to compute perturbative
contributions to the free energy of sym while taking advantage of dimensional reduction
(sym104) to determine the eective parameters of esym. this is a major simplication for
computing f () to order less than 3 [23]. starting at order 3, there are non-perturbative
contributions as well as perturbative contributions. non-perturbative eects are described
by msym, a pure gauge theory in 3 dimensions. as we have already pointed out, the
eective eld theory approach gives rise to eective eld theories in 3 dimensions, without
fermions, that are suitable for non-perturbative studies on the lattice. lattice simulations
of the eective eld theories could therefore be used to explore the non-perturbative sector
of n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills.
