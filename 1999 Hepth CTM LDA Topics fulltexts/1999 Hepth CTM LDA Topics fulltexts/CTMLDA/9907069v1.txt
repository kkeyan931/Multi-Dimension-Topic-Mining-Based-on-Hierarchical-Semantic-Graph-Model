abstract

we generalize the lund-regge model for vortex string dynamics in 4-dimensional

minkowski space to the arbitrary n-dimensional case. the n-dimensional vortex equa-

tion is identied with a nonabelian sine-gordon equation and its integrability is proven

by nding the associated linear equations of the inverse scattering. an explicit expres-

sion of vortex coordinates in terms of the variables of the nonabelian sine-gordon sys-

tem is derived. in particular, we obtain the n-dimensional vortex soliton solution of the

hasimoto-type from the one soliton solution of the nonabelian sine-gordon equation.

the relativistic motion of vortex strings in a superuid was rst modeled by lund and

regge in 1976 [1]. among many vortex models, their model is distinguished in that it is

an exactly integrable model and it becomes the nambu string model in the no-coupling

limit. in the context of string theory, the nonvanishing coupling term also received an

interpretation as describing the interaction of a string with background antisymmetric

tensor elds [2]. lund and regge has proven the integrability of the model by recognizing

the vortex equation as the integrability equation of gauss and codazzi3 [1, 3]. they

have identied the vortex equation with the complex sine-gordon equation [5] and found

the associated linear equations of the inverse scattering. since then, the complex sine-

gordon theory has been studied intensively [6]-[10], with applications to nonlinear optics

[11]. extensions to more general cases of the nonabelian sine-gordon theories have been

also made by associating them with symmetric spaces [12] and their properties were

investigated in detail [13, 14].

however, the vortex model by lund and regge is dened only in the 3+1-dimensional

minkowski space and the higher-dimensional model which generalizes the n+1-dimensional

nambu string model is not known. even in the 3+1-dimensional case, the identication

of the vortex equation with the complex sine-gordon equation is not complete. the

variables of the complex sine-gordon equation has been given in terms of the vortex

string coordinates, but the expression of the vortex string coordinates in terms of the

complex sine-gordon variables is not known. since exact solutions, e.g.

solitons and

breathers, have been constructed only in the context of the complex sine-gordon equa-

tion, the explicit correspondence to the vortex string coordinates is critical in obtaining

exact solutions of the vortex equation systematically using the inverse scattering method.

in this letter, we resolve these two problems. we rst present an n+1-dimensional

generalization of the vortex equation which reduces to the nambu string in the no-coupling

limit. we identify the n+1-dimensional vortex equation with the nonabelian sine-gordon

equation and prove the integrability by nding the associated linear equations of the

inverse scattering. in doing so, we obtain an expression of vortex coordinates in terms

of the variables of the nonabelian sine-gordon system. using this relation, we obtain

explicitly an n-dimensional hasimoto-type vortex soliton from the one soliton solution of

3many integrable equations arise from the study of the surface embedding problem in
dierential geometry which provides a clear geometrical meaning to integrable equations.
for the modern formulation of surface embedding problem, see for example in [4].

2

the nonabelian sine-gordon equation.

we begin with a review of the vortex model by lund and regge. the relativistic

motion of vortices in a uniform static eld is governed by the equation of motion (in a

lorentz frame in which x 0 =  ):

(2

  2

)x i + cijk x jx k = 0, ; i = 1, 2, 3

and also by the quadratic constraints:

( x i)2 + (x i)2 = 1,

(x i)( x i) = 0.

(1)

(2)

here, x (,  );  = 0, 1, 2, 3 are the vortex coordinates and ,  are local coordinates

on the string world-sheet. in the no-coupling limit (c = 0), this equation describes the

transverse modes of the 4-dimensional nambu-goto string in the orthonormal gauge. the

critical step leading to the integration of of the vortex equation (1) and (2) was to interpret

the equation as the gauss-codazzi integrability condition for the embedding of a surface,

i.e. the embedding of the string world-sheet projected down to the x 0 =  hypersurface

into the 3-dimensional euclidean space, x 0 =  . the induced metric on the projected

world-sheet is given by

ds2 = ( ~x)2d2 + 2( ~x   ~x)dd + ( ~x)2d 2,

or

ds2 = cos2d2 + sin2d 2

(3)

(4)

by parameterizing ( ~x)2 = cos2, ( ~x)2 = sin2 according to eq. (2) . the unit
tangent vectors, ~n1 and ~n2, spanning the plane tangent to the surface, and the unit
normal vector ~n3 consisting a moving frame are given by

~n1 =

1

| ~x|

 ~x,

~n2 =

1

| ~x|

 ~x,

~n3 =

1

| ~x   ~x|

 ~x   ~x.

(5)

the vectors ( ~ni; i = 1, 2, 3), given coordinates u1, u2 on the surface, satisfy the equation
of gauss and weingarten:

 ~ni
uk

= l
ik

~nl + lik ~n3,

 ~n3
uk

= gijlkj ~ni,

(6)

3

where l

ik are the christoel symbols and the lij are the components of the extrinsic
curvature tensor. they are a set of overdetermined linear equations and the consistency

of which requires the gauss-codazzi equation:

rijkl = likljl  lilljk, lij;k = lik;j,

(7)

where the semicolon denotes covariant dierentiation on the surface and rijkl are the

components of its riemann tensor. from eq. (7), it follows that there exists a eld 

such that

l12 = cot


u2

,

1
2

(l11 + l22) = cot


u1

.

(8)

we introduce the light-cone coordinates z = ( +  )/2,

z = (   )/2 and make the

coordinate transformation: z  z/, z  z under which the gauss-codazzi equation

is invariant due to its lorentz invariance. in this case, the gauss-weingarten equation in

the spin-1/2 representation changes into the linear equation of the inverse scattering [3]:

 = (u0 + u1),

 = (v0 + 1v1),

(9)

where

u0 + u1 = (cid:18) ic/4 + icos2/2sin2
4 (cid:18) ccos2/  2 /sin2

 + icot

csin2/

v0 + 1v1 = 

i

 + icot

ic/4  icos2/2sin2(cid:19)
ccos2/ + 2 /sin2(cid:19) .

csin2/

the integrability equation:

[ + u0 + u1,  + v0 + 1v1] = 0,

then becomes the complex sine-gordon equation:

  

c2
2

sin2 +

cos
sin3

  = 0

(cot2 ) + (cot2 ) = 0.

this reduces to the well-known sine-gordon equation when  = 0.

(10)

(11)

(12)

even though the vortex equation as in eqs.

(1) and (2) has been identied with

the complex sine-gordon equation as in eq. (12), the explicit correspondence between

variables of each equations is not well understood. in particular, it is not known how to

4

write the vortex coordinates x i from the variables of the complex sine-gordon system.

in order to resolve this problem, and also to extend the vortex equation to the higher-

dimensional case, we rst consider the linear equation in eq. (9) and assume that matrices

u0, u1 and v0, v1 are valued in a certain lie algebra g but otherwise arbitrary. dene

f  1(z, z, )




(z, z, ).

then, using eq. (9), we have

f = 1u1,

f =

1


1v1.

also, using eqs. (9) and (11), we obtain

 f = 1[u1, v1] = [ f, f ].

(13)

(14)

(15)

let f = p x it i (i = 1, ..., n = dimg) where t i are generators of the lie algebra g

normalized by tr t it j = 2ij and  is some constant. then, eq. (15) becomes

 x i = f ijk x jx k,

(16)

where f ijk are structure constants of the lie algebra g. note that for g  so(3) this

becomes precisely the vortex equation in eq. (1). the constraints as in eq. (2), after the

coordinate transformation z  z/, z  z, are equivalent to the condition:

tr (f )2 = 2tr (u1)2 = 222, tr ( f )2 =

1
2 tr (v1)2 =

1
2 22.

(17)

thus, we dene the n-dimensional generalization of the vortex equation in terms of eqs.

(15)-(17). this equation is integrable in the sense that it arises from the linear equation

(9) of the inverse scattering.

in order to better understand the model dened by eq.

(9) and the constraint in eq. (17), we rst solve the constraint by xing u1 and v1.

by a gauge transformation, we can always set u1 = t for some constant element t  g

satisfying tr t 2 = 22. the remaining constraint, tr (v1)2 = 22, may be solved for
v1 = g1 t g for some constant element t satisfying tr t 2 = 22 and an arbitrary group
variable g(z, z). the zero curvature condition in eq. (11) should hold for any , that is,

each coecients of the polynomial in  should vanish. thus, the coecients of the  and

the 1 terms give rise to respectively

[ + u0, g1 t g] = 0 and [  + v0, t ] = 0,

(18)

5

which we solve for u0 = g1g + g1ag and v0 = a for some elds a and a satisfying
the relation [a, t ] = 0 and [ a, t ] = 0. finally, the zeroth-order term results in

[ + g1g + g1ag,  + a] + [t, g1 t g] = 0.

(19)

[9]. we
this is precisely the nonabelian sine-gordon equation introduced in the ref.
emphasize that, at this stage, a and a are regarded only as background elds which
commute with arbitrary constant elements t and t respectively. further specications

of these variables and their physical meanings are given below. as for the eld theory

formulation, one can readily check that the nonabelian sine-gordon equation (19) arises

from the gauged wess-zumino-novikov-witten action plus a potential term:

s = sw zn w (g) + sgauge  spot

(20)

sw zn w (g) =

tr (g1dg  g1dg  g1dg) ,

4 z
2 z tr(a gg1 + ag1g + ag ag1  a a) ,
2 z dzdztr(g t g1t ),

sgauge =

spot =

1

where sw zn w (g) is the usual wess-zumino-novikov-witten action.

the nonabelian sine-gordon model in eq. (19) associated with a lie algebra g is

rather general for the practical purpose of obtaining exact solutions. thus, we make
further restrictions by specifying t and t as follows; we assume that t and t belong to

the cartan subalgebra of g and the subalgebra h  g is the common centralizer of t and
t , i.e. h = {h  g : [t, h] = 0, [ t , h] = 0}. we also assume a and a to be valued in h

so that the gauged wess-zumino-novikov-witten action, sw zn w (g) + sgauge, becomes
the g/h-wznw action for the coset conformal eld theory [15]. note that the potential

term spot is invariant under the h-group action so that the whole action s possesses the
group h-vector gauge invariance if we treat a and a as gauge connections. moreover,
we could further restrict the model by treating a and a as lagrangian multipliers which

give rise to the constraint equations,

(  gg1 + g ag1  a )h = 0,

( g1g + g1ag  a)h = 0.

(21)

here, the subscript h denotes the projection to the subalgebra h. this restricted non-

abelian sine-gordon model corresponding to the coset g/h has been named as the sym-

metric space sine-gordon(sssg) model for the type-ii symmetric spaces [12]. it has been

6

also shown that the eld strength of a, a vanishes, i.e. fz z = [ + a,  + a]. thus, we
may x the vector gauge invariance by taking a = a = 0. note that the vortex string

coordinates in eq. (13) are also invariant under the vector gauge transformation:   h

for an element h(z, z)  h. this means that the vortex solution x i can be obtained from
the solution of the gauge xed (a = a = 0) sssg equation:

and the constraints,

 (g1g) + [t, g1 t g] = 0,

(g1g)h = 0,

( gg1)h = 0.

(22)

(23)

other types of symmetries of the vortex and the sssg models are also interconnected.

for example, the symmetry of the sssg equation under the parity transformation: g 
z  z, for p a constant element which anti-commutes with t and t , induces

p g,

a symmetry of the vortex equation under the exchange(   ) of string world-sheet
coordinates. on the other hand, the transformation: (, z, z)  (, z, z) () for a
unitary element (), which leaves the linear equation (9) invariant, induces the rotational

and the translational transformation a vortex such that

f  ()1f () +  ()1 d ()
d

.

(24)

if () is not unitary, e.g. () = f () for some function f (), the trace of f changes.

thus we can always set the trace to zero by choosing an appropriate f ().

next, we derive a vortex solution from the one soliton solution of the sssg equation.

instead of applying the method of inverse scattering, we adopt the following backlund

transformation to derive the one soliton solution; let (f, f ) is a solution of the linear

equation (9). then, (g, g) is another solution provided that

and

g =



  ib(cid:16)1 +

ib


g1f(cid:17)f

g1g  f 1f  ib[g1f, t ] = 0

ib (g1f ) + g1 t g  f 1 t f = 0,

(25)

(26)

where b is a parameter of the backlund transformation. for simplicity, we take a trivial

solution for (f, f ) such that

f = 1, f = exp(t z  1 t z).

(27)

7

one can easily see that this corresponds to the straight vortex line ff = t z + 1 t z.
in order to solve eq. (26) with the trivial solution in eq. (27), we use the fact that g1g

is anti-hermitian so that [g  g1, t ] = 0 due to eq. (26). this may be solved in terms

of a hermitian projection matrix p satisfying p 2 = p, p  = p by

g = 2cosp  ei.

(28)

where  is some constant parameter. the linear equation now changes into

(1  p )(  ibeit )p = 0,

(1  p )(ibei   t )p = 0.

(29)

if we consider only the 1-dimensional projection, we may write

pij = sis
j /

sks
k

n

xk=1

so that eq. (29) becomes

(  ibeit )~s = 0,

(ibei   t )~s = 0.

this can be integrated immediately to yield

si =

[exp(ibeit z  iei t z/b)]ikuk,

n

xk=1

where ui are constants of integration. finally, using

g = f ()(cid:16)1 +

ib


(2cosp  ei)(cid:17)exp(t z  1 t z)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

where f () is chosen to make f traceless, we obtain the n-dimensional vortex soliton

solution of the hasimoto-type [16]:

2ibcos

f =

2bsin  2  b2hexp(t z + 1 t z)p exp(t z  1 t z)  1/2i  t z + 1 t z,

(34)

where p is dened by eqs. (30) and (32).

now, we restrict to the case of lund and regge by taking g  so(3) and t i = i

where i are pauli matrices. c and  as in eqs. (1) and (16) are related by c = 4i.
choosing t and t by t =  t = ic3/4 and also with an appropriate parametrization
of an su(2) element g, one can readily see that the sssg equation becomes the complex

8

sine-gordon equation in eq. (12). the vortex coordinates x i in eq. (1) are given by the

components of f with the following scaling;

xi = 

4i
c

fi(cid:16)z =

1
2

( +  ), z =


2

(   )(cid:17).

then, the vortex soliton in eq. (34) becomes

x1 = rsech cos,

x2 = rsech sin,

x3 = r tanh  + ,

where

(37)

in this paper, we have extended the vortex equation by lund and regge to the n-

dimensional case and proved its integrability by mapping the vortex equation into the

nonabelian sine-gordon equation dened in association with a lie algebra g of dimen-

sion n. through the identication, we have obtained explicit correspondence between

vortex coordinates and the variables of the nonabelian sine-gordon system, and also the

hasimoto-type one soliton solution for the vortex equation. other explicit solutions can

be also found through this correspondence with interesting physical implications. this

will appear elsewhere [17].
