abstract

motivated by the universe as a brane idea, we investigate the
motion of a (d2)-brane (or domain wall) that couples to bulk matter.
usually one would expect the spacetime outside such a wall to be
time dependent however we show that in certain cases it can be static,
with consistency of the israel equations yielding relationships between
the bulk metric and matter that can be used as ansatze to solve the
einstein equations. as a concrete model we study a domain wall
coupled to a bulk dilaton with liouville potentials for the dilaton
both in the bulk and on the wall. the bulk solutions we nd are all
singular. some have black hole or cosmological horizons, beyond which
our solutions describe domain walls moving in time dependent bulks.
a signicant period of world volume ination occurs if the potential
on the wall is not too steep; in some cases the bulk also inates (with
the wall comoving) while in others the wall moves relative to a non-
inating bulk. we apply our method to obtain cosmological solutions
of horava-witten theory compactied on a calabi-yau space.

1 introduction

a domain wall in a d-dimensional spacetime is an extended object with d2
spatial dimensions which partitions the spacetime into dierent domains. in
cosmology, the dierent domains might correspond to dierent vacua of some
higgs eld. we will use the term domain wall loosely to refer to any
(d  2)-brane moving in d dimensions.
when the gravitational back-reaction of a domain wall is included, the
global causal structure of the resulting spacetime is usually modied. in the
simplest models, one considers domain walls which do not couple to any bulk
elds with the domain wall world volume governed by a nambu-goto action

sdw = z 

dd1xh

(1.1)

where  is a parameter which corresponds to the tension or energy density of
the wall,  denotes the world volume swept out by the wall and h denotes the
determinant of the world volume metric. more precisely, the stress-energy
tensor tm n of the domain wall takes the simple form

tm n = (x)diag(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0),

(1.2)

where x is the direction transverse to the wall. this stress-energy tensor
is a distributional source for the einstein equations: the metric is at most
c 0 as we move across such a thin wall of energy density. one approach
to understanding the gravitational eld of such an object is to divide the
spacetime into smooth domains, where each domain is bounded by a domain
wall. if we vary the metric to obtain the equations of motion then we obtain
the well-known israel matching conditions [1]:

{km n  khm n} = 8ghm n ,

(1.3)

where hm n is the induced metric on the domain wall, km n its extrinsic
curvature and k = hm n km n . the extrinsic curvature is typically discon-
tinuous across a domain wall; the curly brackets denote summation over each
side of the wall1. we present a careful derivation of the israel conditions from
the einstein-hilbert action in section 2.

1our convention is that the normal to domain wall points into the bulk on both sides,

so we take a sum over the sides of the wall rather than a dierence.

2

the israel conditions are often used to study the motion of a domain
wall in a static bulk spacetime. they are satised by seeking totally umbilic
(km n  hm n ) surfaces in the bulk, slicing along such a surface and then
gluing to another such bulk. for example, domain walls between domains
corresponding to dierent vacua of a higgs eld can be obtained by taking
the bulk spacetime to be at [2, 3, 4] or false vacuum decay can be studied by
taking the two bulk portions to have diering cosmological constants [2, 5].
one can have a domain wall enclosing a bubble of true vacuum in a sea of
false vacuum. the israel conditions reduce to two equations, one giving the
velocity of the domain wall and the other its acceleration. consistency of
these equations follows from the bulk einstein equations.

if the domain wall action is of the nambu-goto form considered above
then the energy density on the wall is xed so there can be no transfer of
energy between the bulk matter and the wall. however it is possible to
consider more general situations in which matter is localised to the wall
and energy can ow on or o the wall. in this case, the right hand side of
equation 1.3 is replaced by the energy-momentum tensor of the wall matter.
for simple static bulk solutions the israel conditions reduce to two equations,
one relating the velocity of the wall to its energy density and the other relating
its acceleration to its energy density and pressure. there is also an equation
of state for the matter on the wall. thus there are three equations for three
quantities (position, energy density and pressure) so one would expect a
solution to exist without further restrictions on the bulk spacetime.

this changes if the domain wall couples to matter in the bulk. for ex-
ample, in string theory a brane or domain wall will usually be coupled to
a dilaton  - a bulk scalar eld which measures the scale or deformation
properties of some internal manifold. the simple nambu-goto form for the
world volume action is replaced by an action of the form

sdw = z 

dd1xh v (),

(1.4)

where v is some potential depending on the value of the dilaton on the wall.
if the domain wall moves through regions of varying dilaton then energy will
ow on or o the wall. if one attempts to nd solutions for the domain wall
motion as before then one encounters a problem. once again there are three
equations for three quantities but now the energy density and pressure on
the wall are specied by its position in the bulk. hence there is no guarantee
that a solution will exist for the motion of the wall in a static bulk spacetime:

3

in general the motion of the domain wall will make the bulk time dependent.
studying dynamics in this model is hard because the bulk metric will depend
on two parameters (time and distance from the wall) so the einstein equations
become more dicult to solve.

in this paper we investigate the circumstances under which it is possible
for a domain wall coupled to bulk matter to move in a static bulk. starting
from a static ansatz for the bulk metric we nd in section 4 that consistency
of the israel equations requires that the bulk metric and matter be related
in a certain way. this can be used to nd solutions of the bulk einstein
equations. we concentrate on the example of a bulk dilaton with liouville
potentials in the bulk and on the domain wall. this model can be motivated
by massive supergravity theories and p-brane world volume actions. domain
walls in such models have been extensively studied for static bulk spacetimes
[6, 7] (see [8] for a review), especially in the supersymmetric case [6, 9].
however all of these solutions assume a constant dilaton on the domain wall
whereas in our solutions the dilaton evolves in time on the wall.

our bulk solutions are described in section 5. all are singular but in some
cases the singularity is hidden behind a horizon. some have cosmological
horizons beyond which the metric becomes time dependent. the motion of
the domain wall can be followed across the horizon so some of our solutions
describe the evolution of a domain wall in a cosmological background.

there has been recent interest in cosmological models in which our uni-
verse is viewed as a brane moving in a higher dimensional spacetime, possibly
with a very low fundamental planck scale and consequently large extra di-
mensions [10]. a topic of particular interest in this scenario is how ination
occurs on the brane. in [11] it was concluded that for a viable model the
bulk must be non-static during ination. however in this model ination was
assumed to be driven by a scalar eld restricted to the brane world volume
and the possibility of the energy density on the brane coming from a bulk
eld was not discussed. in [12] it was described how ination can occur if
one of a stack of branes is displaced from the others. in the case of a stack of
d-branes, the energy density that drives world volume ination arises from
the energy of open strings stretched between the branes. this energy can
be viewed as coming from the non-zero expectation value of a world volume
higgs eld.
ination was discussed in [13] where the bulk spacetime was
assumed to be non-static but the gravitational back reaction of the domain
wall was treated in an approximate manner that didnt correspond to a wall

4

localized in the extra dimensions. in [14] solutions were given for localized
domain walls with ination driven by matter living on the wall. our model
can be used to study ination driven by energy density on the domain wall
coming from a bulk eld, taking full account of the gravitational back reac-
tion of the wall.

we nd in section 6 that power law ination can occur on the domain
wall provided that the potential on the world volume is not too steep. in
some cases ination occurs because the domain wall is comoving with an
inationary bulk while in others it occurs because the domain wall moves
relative to the bulk.

in section 7 we show that for some values of the parameters our model can
be obtained by dimensional reduction of a nambu-goto domain wall moving
in a bulk spacetime with a cosmological constant. the world volumes of
these domain walls undergo exponential ination, which gives the power law
ination described above in the dimensionally reduced theory.

cosmological solutions of horava-witten theory, the strongly coupled
limit of the e8  e8 heterotic superstring theory, have been recently dis-
cussed in [15, 16, 17]. the orbifold xed planes in this theory can be viewed
as domain walls so our method is well suited to nding new solutions. we
discuss these in section 8.

in section 9 we discuss our conclusions and speculate on possible gener-
alisations and applications of our work to cosmology and the dynamics of
branes in string theory.

2 the israel matching conditions

this section consists of a simple derivation of the israel conditions [1] for
matching the metric across a domain wall. the reader familiar with this
derivation is advised to skip to the next section.

let m be a d dimensional manifold containing a domain wall , which
splits m into two parts, m. we demand that the metric be continuous
everywhere and that the derivatives of the metric be continuous everywhere
except on . we shall denote the two sides of  as .

5

varying the einstein-hilbert action in m gives2

seh =

1

2 z

dd1xhgm n np (m gn p  p gm n ),

(2.1)

where nm is the unit normal pointing into m and the induced metric on
 is given by the tangential components of the projection tensor hm n =
gm n  nm nn . note that the quantity in brackets vanishes when contracted
with nm nn np so we can replace gm n by hm n to get

seh =

1

2 zm

dd1xhhm n np (m gn p  p gm n ).

(2.2)

this expression contains a normal derivative of the metric variation, which
we are allowing to be discontinuous across , so the contributions from the
two bulk regions will not necessarily cancel. therefore it is necessary to
include a gibbons-hawking boundary term [18] to cancel this term. on each
side of the domain wall we include a contribution to the action

sgh = z

dd1xhk,

(2.3)

where k is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of  i.e. k = hm n km n ,
km n = hp

m hq

we now have to compute the variation of this new term. this is slightly
complicated by the fact that nm depends on the metric because it is nor-
malised to unit length. when the metric is varied, the change in nm is

np nq.

nm =

1
2

nm np nqgp q.

(2.4)

the variation in k is

k = k m n gm n hm n np (m gn p 
and the variation of the gibbons-hawking term is

(2.6)

2we use units in which 8g = 1, a positive signature metric and a curvature convention

for which de sitter space has a positive ricci scalar.

note that k contains a term 1
2hm n npp gm n , which cancels the corre-
sponding normal derivative in the variation of the einstein-hilbert action.
the total variation is

hm n npm gn p  k m n gm n +
khm n gm n(cid:21) .

(2.7)

to proceed further we need the following simple result for a vector eld

x m tangential to 
m x m = hm nm xn + nm nnm xn = m x m  x m nnn xm ,
(2.8)
where  is the covariant derivative associated with the induced metric on
. using this and the denition of km n gives

hm n npm gn p = m (hm n np gn p )  gn pm (hm n np )

= m (hm n np gn p ) + knm nn gm n  k m n gm n .

(2.9)

finally this can be substituted into 2.7 and the total derivative term inte-
grated away to give

seh + sgh =

dd1x

2 z

h(cid:16)k m n + khm n(cid:17) gm n .

(2.10)

note that km n can be discontinuous across  so the contributions from 
need not cancel.

if the domain wall has action

then its variation is

sdw = z

dd1xhldw

sdw = z

dd1xhtm n gm n ,

(2.11)

(2.12)

where we have used the fact that tm n  2h
is tangential to the domain
wall. the variation of the total action s = seh + sgh + sdw gives the israel
conditions

sdw
hm n

{km n  khm n} = tm n ,

(2.13)

7

m tm n = nhn m rm p npo
= nhn m tm p npo ,

where t m n is the bulk energy momentum tensor and we have made use of
the bulk einstein equation. this equation describes conservation of energy
when it moves from the bulk to the boundary or vice versa.

(2.14)

(2.15)

(3.1)

(3.2)

where the curly brackets denote summation over both sides of .

the stress energy tensor tm n on the domain wall is not necessarily con-
served because energy can ow between the domain wall and the bulk. this
can be seen by taking the divergence of the israel equations:

m tm n = n m k m n  hm n m ko .

the right hand side can be evaluated using codaccis equation [19], giving

3 the equations of motion

the example that we shall be focussing on is einstein gravity with a scalar
eld (dilaton) in the bulk and a domain wall that couples to the bulk dilaton.
the action is

where

s = zm

sdw = z

dd1xh({k} + v ()).

note that we have absorbed the gibbons-hawking terms into the domain
wall action. once again, curly brackets denote summation over both sides of
the wall. the bulk einstein equation is

rm n = m n  +

varying the scalar eld gives

(3.4)

which yields the equation of motion

2 =

with a boundary condition at the domain wall

{n.} =

.

this ensures that the energy conservation equation 2.15 is satised.

we also need the israel equations, which can be written

{km n} = 

1

d  2

v ()hm n .

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

4 domain wall motion in a static background

we shall seek solutions in which the bulk spacetime is symmetric under
reection in the domain wall, hence the extrinsic curvatures on each side of
the wall are the same and the israel equations become

km n = 

1

2(d  2)

v ()hm n .

(4.1)

in general there is no reason to assume that a moving domain wall will give
rise to a static bulk spacetime. however it is sometimes possible that this
can occur. consider a bulk metric

ds2 = a(r)dt2 + b(r)dr2 + r(r)2d2
k,

(4.2)

where d2
k is the line element on a d  2 dimensional space of constant
curvature with metric gmn and ricci tensor rmn = k(d  3)gmn with k 
{1, 0, 1}. we shall also include a dilaton (r).
let the position of the domain wall be r = r(t) with the above metric
valid on the r < r(t) parts of surfaces of constant t and its reection valid
on the r > r(t) parts. the unit normal pointing into r < r(t) is

nm =

ab
a  b r2

9

( r,1, 0, . . . , 0)

(4.3)

where r = dr

dt . the proper velocity of the domain wall is

um =

(1, r, 0, . . . , 0).

(4.4)

1

a  b r2
m hq

the extrinsic curvature is km n = hp
np nq where hm n = gm n  nm nn .
we shall compute it in the basis given by um , nm , e(1)
where the
e(i)
m are an orthonormal basis for the d  2 dimensional spatial sections. in
this basis, the ij components of the extrinsic curvature are

m , . . . , e(d2)

kij =

(4.5)

where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to r. the k00 component
can be calculated as described in [20]. orthogonality of um and nm gives

k00 = km n um un = um unm nn = nn umm un = nm am ,

(4.6)

where am is the proper acceleration of the wall. note um am = 0 so am =
anm for some a. hence k00 =  a. to compute a we can exploit the
existence of a timelike killing vector k = 
t. let  denote proper time along
the wall. then

(km um ) = um unm kn + km am = km am = km nm a,

where we have used killings equation. putting these results together gives

this equation has to hold at every point visited by the domain wall. thus
unless the domain wall remains at xed r (i.e.
r  0) then it has to hold
over a range of r and can therefore be integrated, giving

r = c v ()ab,

(4.11)

where c is a constant.

we can now turn to the boundary condition on the dilaton. equation 3.6

can be simplied using equation 4.9 and reection symmetry to give

(4.12)

which, if the wall visits a range of r, can be solved (in principle) to yield 
as a function of r without specifying the bulk potential.

hence demanding that the domain wall be non-static in a static bulk
gives conditions relating the bulk metric and dilaton. in the next section we
shall use these conditions as ansatze to solve the bulk einstein equations.

5 the bulk metric

it is convenient to adopt the gauge a(r) = b(r)1 = u(r) for the metric.
the eld equations are then

the ansatze 4.11 and 4.12 can be employed to seek solutions of these equa-
tions. they ensure that equation 5.1 is satised. to proceed further it is
necessary to specify the domain wall potential. we shall specialise to the
case of a liouville potential:

v () = v0e.

v0 > 0, m > 0

v0 > 0, m < 0

v0 < 0, m > 0

v0 < 0, m < 0

figure 1: u(r) for the type i solutions. dotted lines indicate alternative
behaviour.

equations 4.11 and 4.12 can be solved simultaneously to give

log r,

(5.7)
where  is a constant of integration. (a second constant of integration can
be set to zero by shifting the range of r.)

2(d2)+1 ,

to make further progress it is necessary to specify the bulk potential. we

shall assume that this is also of liouville type:

v () = v0e.

(5.8)

then equation 5.3 can be solved for u(r). substituting into equations 5.2 and
5.4 yields constraints on the parameters. there are three types of solutions.

type i solutions have  =  = 0, so the potential becomes a cosmological
constant. the solution has constant dilaton  = 0. after rescaling t and
changing variable from r to r, the metric can be written

ds2 = u(r)dt2 + u(r)1dr2 + r2d2
k,

(5.9)

with

u(r) = k  2mr(d3) 

2v0

(d  1)(d  2)

r2,

(5.10)

where m is a constant. if m = 0 then this is simply the metric of de sitter,
minkowski or anti-de sitter spacetime according to the sign of v0. u(r) is
sketched in gure 1 for m 6= 0. it is easy to read o the horizon structure of
the solutions from these diagrams.

12

when v0 > 0, m < 0 there are two possibilities. if k = +1 and

"

2v0

(d  2)(d  3)#d3

[(d  1)m]2 < 1

(5.11)

(this corresponds to the dotted line in the rst graph of gure 1) then the
solution is simply schwarzschild-de sitter, which has black hole and cosmo-
logical horizons give by the two zeros of u(r). if k 6= +1 or equation 5.11
is not satised (corresponding to the solid line) then the solution is nowhere
static (r is a time coordinate) and there is a cosmological singularity at
r = 0. at late times the metric approaches that of de sitter space.

if v0 > 0, m < 0 then there is a timelike naked singularity at r = 0.
there is also a cosmological horizon (with geometry determined by k) beyond
which the metric is asymptotically de sitter.

for v0 < 0, m > 0, there is a singularity at r = 0 surrounded by an
event horizon beyond which the metric is asymptotically anti-de sitter. if
k = +1 this is the schwarzschild-anti de sitter solution. if k = 0 or k = 1
then it describes a topological black hole with a at or hyperbolic event
horizon. this can be made compact by making identications however this
would also make the spatial sections of the domain wall compact.
when v0 < 0, m < 0, there are two possibilities. if k = 1 and

"

2|v0|

(d  2)(d  3)#d3

[(d  1)|m|]2 < 1

(5.12)

(corresponding to the dotted line in the nal graph of gure 1) then the
metric describes a topological black hole in an asymptotically anti-de sitter
space, while if k 6= 1 or equation 5.12 is not satised then it describes a
timelike naked singularity in an asymptotically anti-de sitter space.

the function u(r) is sketched in gure 2. these solutions (and their charged
generalizations) were derived for d = 4 in [21] using the ansatz r  rn . the
solutions with m = 0 for arbitrary d were derived in [9]. note that when
 = /2, the theory becomes scale invariant in the sense that a constant
scale transformation gm n  2gm n ,     2
 log  simply multiplies the
action by a constant: s  d2s. this means that the equations of motion
are invariant under such a transformation.
all of the type ii solutions are singular at r = 0. for some the singularity
is timelike and for others it is spacelike. there is at most one horizon, which
is like a black hole horizon for some solutions and like a cosmological horizon
for others. the asymptotic (large r) behaviour of the solutions depends on
the value of b2.

 =

14

if b2 < d  1 then the asymptotic behaviour of the metric is determined
by the sign of v0. if v0 > 0 then r is a time coordinate. by rescaling t and
the at spatial sections and changing variable r  t (r), the metric can be
written as a frw universe with at spatial sections:

ds2  dt 2 + t

2

b2 dx2,

(5.18)

which is inating if b2 < 1. if v0 < 0 then r is a spatial coordinate. by
rescaling the other coordinates and changing variable r  (r), one can put
the metric into the form

ds2  d2 + 

2

b2 (dt2 + dx2),

(5.19)

which resembles the metric on anti-de sitter space written in horospherical
coordinates. note that when m > 0 these solutions have a black hole type
horizon and can be interpreted as black (d 2) brane solutions, generalizing
some of the supersymmetric solutions given in [9].
when b2 > d  1 the asymptotic behaviour of the metric is determined
by m. if m > 0 then r is a time coordinate and the metric has anisotropic
spatial sections and resembles a kasner solution

b2+d1 dx2,

(5.20)

where we have performed a transformation r  t (r) and rescaled the other
coordinates. the t dimension expands faster than the other three but none
of the spatial dimensions inate. if m < 0 then r is a spatial coordinate and
t a time coordinate and the metric is the same as above with the signs of the
rst two terms changed. when v0 < 0 (still with m < 0), the metric has a
black hole type horizon and hence can be interpreted as a topological black
hole with the curious property that the mass m determines the asymptotic
structure.

we have obtained solutions to the bulk eld equations with non-trivial
dilaton by restricting  to take one of two values determined by . for each
value of  there are two solutions, one with k = 0 and the other with k = 1.

6 analysis of domain wall motion

the trajectory of the domain wall is determined by the israel equation 4.9.
for the gauge used in the previous section, this reduces to

r
r

=

v ()

2(d  2)r(cid:16) dr
d(cid:17)2

,

+ u

(6.1)

where  is proper time on the domain wall world volume. there are two
subtleties that we have to deal with before studying solutions of this equation.
the rst is that the solutions of the previous section all have r > 0, so
the above equation appears to rule out the possibility of v < 0. however
reversing the direction of the normal to the domain wall reverses the sign on
the right hand side. equivalently, if v < 0 then the bulk solutions derived
above are valid on the r > r(t) parts of the surfaces of constant t rather
than the r < r(t) parts. the geometrical interpretation of this is that if one
approaches a domain wall along its normal then the spatial sections grow if
the wall has positive energy density but decrease if it has negative energy
density.

the second subtlety arises when u < 0. if horizons are present then u is
positive in some (static) region but can be negative in other regions. these
can be dealt with in the standard way by introducing eddington-finkelstein
coordinates [19]. the analysis of section 4 can be repeated in these coordi-
nates, reproducing equations 6.1 and 4.11, which demonstrates their validity
when the domain wall crosses a horizon. if u is negative everywhere then r
becomes the time coordinate and it is convenient to reverse the direction of

17

the normal so that the bulk solution is valid on the t < t(r) parts of surfaces
of constant r. equations 6.1 and 4.11 then become valid in this case too.

equation 6.1 can be written

1

d !2
2   dr

+ f (r) = 0

(6.2)

where  is proper time on the domain wall i.e. the induced metric on the
domain wall is

ds2 = d 2 + r( )2d2
k.

(6.3)

this is the metric of a frw universe. equation 6.2 determines the evolution
of the scale factor r( ) and is simply the equation for a particle of unit mass
and zero energy rolling in a potential f (r). the potential f (r) is given by

f (r) =

v 2r2.

(6.4)

clearly solutions only exist when f (r)  0. this is automatic if u < 0
i.e. if r is a time coordinate. inationary solutions are of particular interest.
ination on the domain wall is dened by d2r
dr < 0.
in the next subsections we shall compute f (r) for the solutions found in

d 2 > 0, which occurs when df

there are several cases for which these solutions have been extensively stud-
ied. consider rst the case m = 0. t he bulk spacetime is simply de sitter,
minkowski or anti-de sitter space depending on the sign of v0. the position
of the domain wall is given by solving equation 6.2. for  > 0, r increases
exponentially, corresponding to a de sitter solution on the domain wall world
volume. when v0 > 0, the total bulk spacetime is given by matching the bulk

behaviour.

solution for r < r( ) to a copy of itself across the domain wall at r = r( ).
when v0 < 0, the r > r( ) part of the bulk is matched to a copy of itself
across the domain wall. an example is the vilenkin-ipser-sikivie domain
wall [2, 3, 4], which has minkowski space in the bulk and spherical spatial
sections. for v0 > 0 the solution corresponds to gluing the (at) interior of a
de sitter hyperboloid embedded in minkowski space to a copy of itself while
for v0 < 0 the exterior of the hyperboloid must be used.

if  < 0 then a non-trivial solution only exists for the case of open spatial
sections. the domain wall can expand to a maximum value of r and then
recollapse to r = 0. the world volume and bulk solutions are both anti-de
sitter.

when  = 0 the domain wall vacuum energy exactly cancels the eect of
the (negative) bulk cosmological constant (as far as the motion of the wall
is concerned) and the world volume metric is at. note that f  0 requires
k = 0 or k = 1. in these cases the domain wall is simply a horosphere of
the bulk anti-de sitter space.

when m 6= 0 there is a singularity at r = 0. if the domain wall has
v0 > 0) then the relevant part of the bulk
positive energy density (i.e.
spacetime is r < r( ), which contains the singularity.
if it has negative
energy density then the relevant part is r > r( ), which is non-singular
unless the wall reaches r = 0.

from any solution for the domain wall motion one can generate another
by time reversal. in what follows we shall only discuss one member of each
pair of time reversal related solutions.

f (r) is plotted in gure 4. the qualitative behaviour of the wall is easily
read o from this gure. the four graphs correspond to the following cases.
case i )  > 0, m < 0. there are two possibilities. the rst (given by

from a white hole or cosmological singularity and expands to innity.

if k 6= +1 or equation 6.7 is not satised then the domain wall emerges
case ii )  > 0, m < 0. the bulk has a timelike naked singularity. the
domain wall collapses from innity but is stopped by the repulsive singularity.
it then re-expands to innity.

case iii )  < 0, m > 0. the bulk solution is anti-de sitter space with
a black hole or topological black hole. the domain wall expands out of the
white hole region and the negative cosmological constant overwhelms the
energy density of the domain wall, causing it to recollapse into the black
hole.

case iv )  < 0, m < 0, k = 1 and

d  3#

(d1)

|m|2 < 1,

(6.8)

the domain wall starts at a nite distance from a naked singularity, which
repels it, causing it to accelerate away. this expansion is halted by the
bulk (negative) cosmological constant and recollapse occurs. the cycle then
repeats. thus the world volume of the domain wall describes an open universe
that undergoes a brief period of ination.

note that the cases with  > 0 all expand to innity. this expansion is
accelerating so the world volume undergoes ination. it is easy to see that
the world volume solution approaches de sitter space at late times.

the cases k = 0,1 with v0 < 0 have been studied recently by mann
[23], who was interested in pair creation of charged black holes with arbitrary
event horizon topology. his bulk congurations are slightly more general than
our type i solutions because he allows for a single u(1) charge in the bulk.
he studied the equations of motion for a domain wall in these backgrounds
because he was using the domain wall mechanism [24] to pair create the black
holes.

and expands forever. the singularity may be a timelike naked singularity,
a cosmological singularity or a white hole type singularity hidden behind an
event horizon.

solutions describe a domain wall collapsing from innity to a minimum size
(where f (r) = 0) and then re-expanding to innity. the collapse is halted
by a repulsive timelike naked singularity in the bulk at r = 0.

white hole type singularity and collapsing into a black hole type singularity.

it is interesting to ask how the solutions that expand forever behave at
late times. if b2 < d  1 then the domain wall can only expand forever if
 > 0. the scale factor at late times behaves as 
b2 , which is inationary
if b2 < 1. when v0 > 0 this is the same behaviour as the scale factor of
the d  1 dimensional spatial sections of the bulk (see equation 5.18) so the
domain wall is simply comoving with these spatial sections. if v0 < 0 then
the bulk metric is static and the expansion is driven by the energy density
of the domain wall. in the coordinates of equation 5.19, the position of the
b2 . when b2 < 1, t approaches
domain wall is given by  =  and t =
a constant at late proper time while if b2 > 1 then t becomes large at late
proper time.

when b2 > d  1, the large r behaviour of both the domain wall and
the bulk is given by the sign of m. if m < 0 then the domain wall cannot
b2+d1 .
expand indenitely. if m > 0 then at late times, r is proportional to 
comparing this with the behaviour of the bulk (equation 5.20) we see that
the domain wall once again sits at a xed position relative to the expanding
bulk spatial sections and the bulk expands fastest in the direction transverse
to the domain wall.

2

there are two solutions which give a nite period of ination. these are
the  > 0, m < 0, 1 < b2 < d  1 solution and the  < 0, m > 0, b2 >
d  1 solution. in both of these the domain wall collapses from innity, gets
repelled by a timelike naked singularity and then expands. ination occurs
when the expansion starts. in both cases the scale factor increases by a factor
of

which is cosmologically negligible unless b2 is exponentially close to 1. note
that this expression is independent of m, a consequence of scale invariance.

this is sketched in gure 6. the behaviour can be divided into ve classes.
class i ) f (r) is negative everywhere. in these solutions the domain wall
expands out of a cosmological singularity, timelike naked singularity or white
hole singularity and expands forever.

class ii ) f (r) is negative for small r and positive for large r. the
domain wall either expands out of a timelike naked singularity and recollapses
into the same singularity, or it expands out of a white hole singularity and
collapses into a black hole singularity.

class iii ) f (r) is positive for small r and negative for large r. the
domain wall collapses from innity to a nite size and then re-expands to

23

innity. in most cases the collapse is halted by a timelike naked singularity.
the exception is if b2 > 1, v0 < 0 and m is positive but less than a calculable
upper bound (corresponding to the solid line in the relevant graph of gure
6). then the turning point occurs outside the horizon of a spherical black
hole.

1

class iv ) f (r) is positive for a nite range of r. this only occurs when
d1 < b2 < 1, v0 < 0 and m is negative but greater than a calculable lower
bound (corresponding to the solid line in the relevant graph of gure 6). the
domain wall is repelled by a naked timelike singularity, inates for a brief
period, decelerates to a halt, recollapses and then repeats this cycle. the
world volume describes an open bouncing universe.

the solutions which expand to innity exhibit late time behaviour of two
dierent types. when b2 < 1 and v0 > 0, the rst term in f is dominant at
late times. this term can be thought of as the term arising from the bulk
curvature. all of these solutions have spherical spatial sections and at late
times the scale factor grows linearly with proper time

.

(6.13)

if we compare this with the asymptotic behaviour of the bulk metric, given
by equation 5.24, it is clear that the domain wall is simply comoving with
the bulk i.e.
it lies at xed t. recall that the topology of the bulk spatial
sections is cylindrical. the domain wall remains at a xed position on the
axis of this cylinder as it expands. note that ination occurs in the bulk in
the direction transverse to the domain wall.

the second type of behaviour occurs for b2 > 1, when the domain wall en-
ergy density becomes dominant at late times. these solutions undergo power
law ination on the world volume with the scale factor growing proportion-
ally to  b2. when v0 > 0, the coordinates of the domain wall with respect
to the bulk spacetime (give by equation 5.24) are t   b2 and t   b21, so
the wall moves relative to the bulk spatial sections. when v0 < 0, the bulk
spacetime is given by equation 5.25 and the position of the domain wall by
   b2 and t   b21.

it is also possible to have world volume ination when b2 < 1. both of
the solutions with 1
d1 < b2 < 1 and m < 0 have nite period of ination
caused by the repulsive eect of a timelike singularity. in the v0 < 0 case,

24

the amount of ination is negligible. in the v0 > 0 case, a signicant amount
of ination only occurs if the dimensionless quantity

|m|v (0)
v (0)2

(6.14)

is exponentially large, corresponding to a very strong singularity or very
small boundary potential.

if b2 < 1

d1, v0 > 0 and m < 0 then an innite amount of ination is
possible. however this ination dies out, with the expansion approaching
constant velocity at late times. a signicant period of rapid ination would
require exponential tuning as above.

7 dimensional reduction

liouville potentials typically arise from dimensional reduction. to see which
couplings can arise in this manner, consider a model in d + n dimensions
with action

s =

8 g z dd+n xg(

r  v0) +

1

2 z

dd+n1xqh({ k} + v0), (7.1)

where bars denote (d + n)-dimensional quantities. the domain wall has a
simple nambu-goto action with tension v0. we can dimensionally reduce
this using the ansatz

ds2 = e2a(x)gm n (x)dxm dxn + e2b(x)gmn(y)dymdym,

(7.2)

where gm n and gmn are the metrics on d-dimensional spacetime and a n-
dimensional internal einstein space respectively and b(x) =  (d2)
n a(x) (to
obtain the reduced action in the einstein frame). the bulk action reduces to

and (x) = 2a(x)/1. we have chosen units so that 8g = 1, where g is
the d dimensional newton constant. note that if we dene the parameters
bi = 1

2id  2 as in section 5 then we have b1 = 1/b2.

if the normal to the domain wall points only in directions corresponding

to the d-dimensional space then the domain wall action reduces to

sdw = z dd1xh (k +

n.) + v0e! ,

(7.5)

2

2 =

where  = 1
2(d2) . the total derivative in the bulk action cancels the
normal derivative in the domain wall action. the bulk action has a sum of
liouville potentials. the boundary action has a single liouville potential. if
either rn = 0 or v0 = 0 then the model reduces to the one we have considered
in previous sections and admits solutions of type ii or type iii respectively.
this implies that some of our type ii (with b2 < 1) and type iii solutions
(with b2 > 1) can be oxidized to higher dimensional models in which the do-
main wall and bulk actions are much simpler. oxidation of a type ii solution
yields a type i solution in (d + n) dimensions with a non-vanishing bulk cos-
mological constant and spatial sections that are products of d-dimensional
at space with a n-dimensional ricci at space. oxidation of a type iii so-
lution yields a type i solution with vanishing bulk cosmological constant and
spatial sections that are products of a d-dimensional sphere (hyperboloid)
with a positively (negatively) curved n-dimensional einstein space.

in terms of the higher dimensional theory, the components of the einstein
equations on the internal space give rise to the scalar equation of motion of
the reduced theory. the components of the israel conditions on the internal
space give equation 3.6, describing the jump in the scalar eld at the domain
wall.

note that the scale transformations of the type ii solutions obtained by
dimensional reduction leave the (d+n) dimensional metric invariant provided
one assumes that the metric on the (ricci at) internal space scales in a
suitable way. this symmetry arises as a result of the dimensional reduction
ansatz. (the cosmological constant and domain wall tension break the scale
invariance of the higher dimensional action.)

the results of this section suggest that it would be possible to generalize
our method to deal with a bulk potential consisting of a sum of liouville
potentials with parameters b = 1
d2 and 1/b. in fact it is straightforward
to show that for a liouville potential on the wall, this is the most general

26

bulk potential for which our method will work3. the bulk solutions in this
case all have k = 1. the k = +1 solutions were constructed in [22].

8 horava-witten cosmology

an interesting scenario for which our method can be used to nd solutions is
that of strongly coupled e8e8 heterotic string theory, which has been iden-
tied by horava and witten with m-theory compactied on a s1/z2 orbifold
with e8 gauge elds living on each orbifold xed plane [25, 26]. this can be
compactied to ve dimensions on a calabi-yau space [27]. matching the
predicted values for the four dimensional gravitational and gut couplings
leads one to the conclusion that the orbifold is an order of magnitude larger
than the calabi-yau space [27, 28]. our universe is identied with one of the
orbifold xed planes. the other xed plane describes a shadow universe
that interacts with our own only via bulk elds.

lukas et al have shown that this ve dimensional theory admits a su-
persymmetric solution describing a pair of domain walls (the orbifold xed
planes) [29]. simple cosmological solutions have also been found by separat-
ing variables in the bulk spacetime [16, 17]. we can apply the methods of
the previous sections to nd further solutions.

the model of lukas et al has  = 

2 = 2, v0 = a2

6 and v0 = 2a,

where a is a constant related to the number of units of four-form ux on
the internal calabi-yau space, and the two sign choices refer to domain
walls of negative and positive energy density, which we shall call m1 and
m2 respectively. note that this theory cannot be obtained by dimensional
reduction of a theory with a cosmological constant. the theory is scale
invariant, so a type ii (k = 0) solution exists. the bulk solution is described
by

3actually there is a special limiting case, namely 2 = 1/(d  2) (i.e. b2 = 1), for

which the bulk potential takes the form (v0 + v1)e 2d2 .

27

the eective potential for the domain walls simplies considerably:

f (r) = mr8,

(8.4)

from which we see that m  0 is necessary for domain wall solutions to
exist in this bulk. if m = 0 then f  0 and the domain walls can be put
anywhere and will remain static. the bulk solution has a timelike naked
singularity at r = 0. the spatial sections must decrease towards m1 and
increase towards m2 so if the former is at r = r1 > 0 then we must put the
latter at r = r2 > r1. the bulk spacetime that is left after imposing reection
symmetry in each domain wall is r1 < r < r2, which is non-singular. this
solution is simply the supersymmetric domain wall solution of lukas et al.

when m > 0 there is a timelike naked singularity at r = 0 and a

(8.5)

where the i are constants. the scale factors on each domain wall grow
very slowly with the velocity approaching zero at late times. there are two
choices of sign for each domain wall, leading to a total of four solutions. in
an obvious notation these can be classied as followed:

(++) solution. the + sign occurs for both walls so they are both moving
outwards. we need 1 < 2 for m1 to occur at the smaller value of r. this
domain wall becomes singular at a nite proper time in its past. at late
times the separation between the two domain walls tends to zero as  4
5 .
the () solutions is simply the time reversed version of this.
(+) solution. m1 has r decreasing and m2 has r increasing. they
must have been coincident at some time in the past then moved apart with
one falling into the singularity. the (+) solution is the time reverse of this,
which has m1 emerging from the singularity then colliding with m2 which is
moving towards the singularity.

since the distance between the universe and the shadow universe gives
the string coupling, (+) solutions describe the pair creation of a universe-
shadow universe pair from a region of very weak string coupling. likewise,
the (+) solutions describe the annihilation of such a pair. it is unclear how
we can assign a rate, or probability, for such processes.

28

9 conclusions

if a domain wall couples to a bulk matter eld then one would expect the
bulk spacetime to be time dependent. we have investigated the conditions
under which it is possible to have such a domain wall moving in a static bulk
spacetime with a dilaton. for the case of liouville potentials in the bulk
and on the wall we have found that if the bulk and boundary exponents are
related in a certain ways then solutions can be found.

the bulk solutions we have found are all singular and have at most one
horizon of black hole or cosmological type. moving across such a horizon
takes one to a non-static region. this allowed us to study dilatonic domain
walls moving in a time dependent bulk. the behaviour of the domain walls
is qualitatively similar to the constant dilaton solutions (type i) in certain
respects i.e. they can fall into the singularity or expand forever. however
in other respects our solutions are dierent. for example, all of the type i
solutions that expand to innity undergo ination whereas we have found
new solutions that decelerate to a constant velocity at innity.

there has been recent interest in cosmological models in which our uni-
verse is viewed as a brane moving in a higher dimensional spacetime [10]. in
light of this, we have concentrated on the issue of ination on the domain
wall world volume. if the domain wall inates then it must either move in the
bulk or the bulk must be inating too. most recent work has concentrated
on the latter possibility. we have solutions describing both cases. we believe
that our model is of interest because the inaton couples to the domain wall
but is not restricted to its world volume. for the type ii solutions, power
law ination occurs when b2 < 1 and for the type iii solutions when b2 > 1.
in the former case the bulk is also inating (if v0 > 0) while in the latter
it is not. the critical value for ination in both cases can be expressed as
2 < 1
d2, so it appears that it is the domain wall coupling rather than the
bulk coupling that dictates whether ination occurs. (note that the critical
value for ination in the bulk is 2 < 4
d2.) these inationary solutions are
similar to the vilenkin-ipser-sikivie domain wall [2, 3, 4] (which undergoes
exponential ination) in the respect that ination occurs because the domain
wall energy dominates bulk eects. however, in our solutions the energy den-
sity of the domain wall tends to zero at late times but ination continues.
(a similar eect occurs in bulk ination from an exponential potential.)

we have shown that dimensional reduction of a theory consisting of ein-

29

stein gravity with a cosmological constant and domain walls with nambu-
goto type actions gives a theory of the type we have considered in this paper.
interestingly the dimensionally reduced theories always have 2 < 1
d2, so
domain wall ination arises naturally from dimensional reduction. this is
presumably because the domain wall spacetime in the higher dimensional
theory is inating. however exponential ination in the higher dimensional
theory becomes power law ination in the reduced theory.

our method can be used to nd new cosmological solutions of horava-
witten theory. these solutions do not appear very phenomenologically in-
teresting.
in order to obtain ination in this model it seems necessary to
include matter restricted to the world volume of the domain walls [14].

we would like to nish by mentioning possible generalizations and ap-
plications of our work. it would be interesting to see if our method could
be extended to nd solutions with dierent potentials in the bulk or on the
boundary. an obvious generalization would be to investigate further the
domain wall motion when the bulk dilaton potential is a sum of liouville
potentials with parameters b and 1/b, as obtained from dimensional reduc-
tion of type i solutions. other possible generalizations could include putting
charge in the bulk (such solutions were described in [21, 22]) or including
matter elds restricted to the domain wall world volume.

another obvious way of generalizing our work would be to relax the as-
sumption of reection symmetry in the domain wall. one could also allow
the bulk potential to vary discontinuously across the wall, as studied for the
case of a cosmological constant in [2, 5]. such a scenario arises in type iia
string theory when d8 branes are considered. romans [30] found a mas-
sive generalization of the type iia supergravity theory. his theory contains
a liouville type potential with an arbitrary (positive) coecient. this was
reformulated in [31] in terms of a ten form eld strength of a nine form poten-
tial that the d8 branes of type iia string theory couple to. the expectation
value of this ten form jumps across a d8-brane. this can be viewed as a
jump in the coecient of a bulk liouville potential. our method might be
useful in obtaining solutions describing dynamic d8 branes in this theory.

the main question concerning our solutions is whether they are stable. in
other words, if the domain wall is perturbed then will the perturbation remain
small or will it grow and change the bulk metric, for example converting a
static metric to a time-dependent one? if they are stable then it would be
interesting to examine how perturbations behave in this model, especially as
