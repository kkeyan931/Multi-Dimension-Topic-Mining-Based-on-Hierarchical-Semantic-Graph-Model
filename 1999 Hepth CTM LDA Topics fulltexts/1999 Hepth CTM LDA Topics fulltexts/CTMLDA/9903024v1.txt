low-energy eective action

abstract: we consider n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory formulated in terms
of n = 2 superelds in harmonic superspace. using the background eld method we
dene manifestly gauge invariant and n = 2 supersymmetric eective action depending
on n = 2 strength superelds and develop a general procedure for its calculation in one-
loop approximation. explicit form for this eective action is found for the case of su(2)
gauge group broken down to u(1).

maximally extended n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory attracts much
attention due to remarkable properties on quantum level and profound links with modern
string/brane activity.
it is natural to expect that an eective action describing many
aspects of quantum theory, such as symmetry breaking, low- and high-energy behaviour,
anomalies and so on, also must possess the many remarkable features in n = 4 sym.
unfortunately, the eective action of n = 4 sym was studied unsuciently so far and
ones know little both about its general structure and about its form in dierent approxi-
mations.

one of the main obstacles to investigate the eective action in n = 4 sym is absence
of adequate quantum formulation such a theory. in our opinion, an ecient technique
of carring out the calculations of eective action in n = 4 sym preserving n = 4
supersymmetry manifestly is still undeveloped. the best we have at present is treatment
of n = 4 sym as n = 2 sym coupled to a specic (hypermultiplet) matter and use the
methods of n = 2 supersymmetric quantum eld theory.

recently dine and seiberg [1] has shown that part of low-energy eective action of
n = 4 sym depending only on n = 2 supereld strengths w and w can be found exactly
up to numerical factor on the base of restrictions imposed by n = 4 supersymmetry. to
be more precise, it was shown that low-energy eective action [w, w ] for n = 4 su(2)
theory is expressed in terms of non-holomorphic eective potential h(w, w ) as follows

[w, w ] = z d4xd8h(w, w )

(1)

where

h(w, w ) = c log

w 2
2 log

w 2
2

(2)

with some numerical coecient c and some scale . the eective action (1) with h(w, w )
(2) is -independent. the explicit calculation of the coecient c have been given in refs
[7, 8]. the generalizations for arbitrary su(n) groups were considered in refs [9, 10]. the
present paper is a brief overview of the approach to calculation of low-energy eective
action in n = 4 sym developed in refs [8, 9].

we consider n = 4 sym formulated in terms of n = 2 superelds in harmonic
superspace [2]. such an approach is still the only one operating with unconstrained n = 2
superelds and explicitly realizing su(2)r-symmetry of n = 2 poincare superalgebra.
manifestly n = 2 supersymmetric calculation of low-energy (holomorphic) eective action
in harmonic superspace was given in refs [3, 4, 6].

from point of view of n = 2 supersymmetry, the n = 4 sym theory describes coupling
of n = 2 vector multiplet to the hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation. in harmonic
superspace approach, the vector multiplet is realized by an unconstrained analytic gauge
supereld v ++ [2] and hypermultiplet can be realized either by real unconstrained analytic
supereld  (-hypermultiplet) or by a complex unconstrained analytic supereld q+ (q-
hypermultiplet) [2]. in the -hypermultiplet realization, the action of n = 4 sym theory
reads

s[v ++, ] =

1

2g2 z d4xd8trw 2 

1

2g2 z d (4)tr++++

in the q-hypermultiplet representation, the n = 4 sym theory is given by the action

s[v ++, q+, q+] =

1

1

2g2 z d4xd4trw 2 
q+i = ijq+

2g2 z d (4)trq+i++qi
j = (q+, q+)

q+
i = (q+, q+) ,

both models (3,4) are manifestly n = 2 supersymmetric. however, they possess the two
extra hidden supersymmetries [2] and, as a result, ones get n = 4 supersymmetric theories
with n = 4 sym content. of course, the theories (3,4) are classically equivalent. our
purpose is to describe a calculation of low-energy eective action for the above theories.
the rst step of calculation is background eld quantization of the model under con-
sideration allowing to preserve manifest gauge invariance and n = 2 supersymmetry.
background eld formulation for n = 2 supersymmetric eld theories in harmonic su-
perspace was developed in ref [4] (see also [5, 6]). within this formulation, the one-loop
eective action (1)[w, w ] for the theories (3,4) looks like

(1)[w, w ] =

tr(2,2)log


2 

i
2

tr(4,0)log


2

i

(5)


2 is the analytic dalambertian introduced in ref [4] and the formal denition of

where
the tr(2,2)log


2 and tr(4,0)log


2 are given in ref [8].

the second step is convenient path integral representation of the eective action
(1)[w, w ] for special background. the low-energy eective action (1) depends only on
w w , therefore it is sucient to choose the background gauge supereld on shell

d(id j)

 w = 0

(6)

where d i
action (5) can represented in the form

 are the standard n = 2 supercovariant derivatives. in this case the eective

exp(i(1)[w, w ]) = r dg++ expn i
r dg++ expn i

2 trr d (4)g++ 
2 g++o
2trr d (4)g++g++o

where analytic integration supereld g++ is constrained by

++g++ = 0

(7)

(8)

the result (7) is quite general and preserve manifestly all symmetries of the theory.

the third step is transformation of the path integral (7) to ones over unconstrained n =
1 superelds [8]. this transformation can be treated as some replacement of integration
variables under the path integral. we introduce also the n = 1 projections of w :  = w |,
2iw = d 2
 |i=2.
as a result, ones obtain

 w |. the details of such a projection are given in ref [8]. here d 2

  d i

exp(i(1)) = z d v dv exp(cid:26) i

2 z d8ztr v v (cid:27)

 = dada  ew d + e w  d  + e2||2

(9)

here da, d, d  are the n = 1 supercovariant derivatives and (1) depends on , w, ,
w , v and v are unconstrained n = 1 complex scalar superelds.

the nal step is calculation of (1) (9) in low-energy limit. we consider the background
gauge supereld corresponding to the unbroken u(1) subgroup of su(2) group in the
coulomb branch. in this case the eective action (1) depending on , , w, w  can be
written as follows

(1) = z d8zw w w  w  4h(, )

2 2 + . . .

(10)

(11)

(12)

to calculate 4h(, )/2 2 we use n = 1 supereld proper-time technique introducing
schwinger kernel for the operator  (9) (see the details of supereld proper-time technique
in ref [11]).



(1) = i

ds
s

ei(e2||2i)s z d8zu(z, z|s)

z

0

where for constant w and w ones obtain

u(z, z|s) =

i

(4is)2 eis(ew de w  d )4(  )e

)2

(xx
4is

it leads to

(13)
one can easily nd a general solution of this equation and restore the function h(w, w ).

4h(, )/2 2 = (4 )2

we nally get

h(w, w ) =

1

4(4)2 log

w 2
2 log

w 2
2

(14)

thus the coecient c in (2) is equal to 1/(4(4)2). all details of the calculations can be
found in ref [8].

to conclude, we have formulated a general procedure of calculating the low-energy

eective action depending on n = 2 strength superelds for n = 4 sym theories.
