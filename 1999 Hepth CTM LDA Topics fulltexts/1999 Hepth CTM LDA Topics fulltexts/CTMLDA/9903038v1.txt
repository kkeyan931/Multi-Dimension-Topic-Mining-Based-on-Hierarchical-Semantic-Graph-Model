abstract

we construct sugra solutions of brane congurations of inter-
secting dp and ns branes. these solutions are semi-localized in the
sense that one of the intersecting branes is smeared along the world
volume of the other, while the second is localized. we examine the
gauge theory that lives on the localized brane, and the various descrip-
tions possible via t and s dualities, and m-theory. we also comment
on possible solutions to fully localized intersections.

1 introduction

the sugra description of intersecting p-branes was considered by many
authors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. in all these works intersecting branes were
smeared in their relative transverse directions. the sugra solution was
characterized by two harmonic functions of the overall transverse coordinates.
intersection rules have been derived in more than one way to ensure stability,
and some unbroken super-symmetry [7, 5]. the metric, dilaton, rr forms
and the ns-ns 2-form are given by a superposition rule [6]. we specialize to
the case where a dp-brane intersects an ns brane over p-1 dimensions.

where hp and h5 are the dp and ns brane harmonic functions for p  4,
x0..p1 and xp..5 are the coordinates shared by both branes and the coordinates
that belong to the ns brane but not to the dp-brane respectively. the
rr form ux is quantized, and corresponds to the number of dp-branes.
we generalize this construction and allow hp and h5 to depend on relative
transverse coordinates as well. the new functions should obey a curved space
laplace equation [6, 9, 21], which in the einstein frame is:

ghi = 0

(2)

note that the functions will not depend on coordinates in the directions
shared by both branes (i.e. 0..p-1). the resulting solution describes a local-
ized intersection of two branes. finding such a solution involves solving the
system of coupled nonlinear dierential equations, (2). solutions of brane
intersections in m-theory also obey a similar superposition rule.

sugra solutions of various brane constructions are of interest due to the
ads/cft duality. intersecting brane congurations were found to be power-
ful tools in analyzing supersymmetric gauge dynamics in various dimensions
[12, 13].
in [15, 16] various brane solutions with 16 supersymmetries and
their eld theory duals where discussed. by nding sugra solutions for in-
tersecting brane congurations one can make statements about eld theories
with less supersymmetries. the near horizon behavior of such solutions may

1

give us a sugra dual of the corresponding eld theory. however, if the
solution is that of a smeared intersection then the eld theory data (gauge
couplings, energy scale) is not apparent.

in this paper we shall nd semi-localized solutions, that is solutions in
which one of the harmonic functions depends only on the overall transverse
coordinates and the other depends on relative transverse coordinates as well.
we shall comment on the eld theory duals that these solutions describe.
we also discuss a possible way of getting solutions for fully localized inter-
sections. some of the solutions that will be presented here have also been
obtained by dimensional reduction from 11 to 10 dimensions in the presence
of singularities [9, 10, 11].

while nishing this work two related papers by d. youm hep-th/9902208,
and a. fayyazuddin, d. smith hep-th/9902210, that contain overlapping
results appeared in the electronic archive.

2 semi-localized ns branes

we start with solutions of dp  ns intersections where the ns brane is
smeared along the 6 direction, and has its world volume along (12345). we
shall think of this conguration as the continuum limit of a periodic array
of ns branes along 6, making h5 independent of x6, see g.(1).
in order
that the total number of ns branes be nite, we shall compactify x6, and
probe this conguration only at distances larger that the compactication
radius. we denote by v the coordinates that belong to the ns but not to the
dp-brane, which is extended in (12..p-1,6).

2.1 ns  d4
we start with an intersection of an ns and d4. the harmonic function
describing n5 smeared ns branes satises 789h5 = 0. this is trivially
solved by 1 + q5/r, where r2 = x2
9 (we consider only spherical
symmetric solution for reasons explained below). we shall work in the near
horizon limit h5 = q5/r. thus the curved space laplace equation for the
harmonic function describing the n4 d4-branes, h4 is
5 789ih4(v, r) = 0

figure 1: a smeared ns-brane as the continuum limit of a periodic array

other dp-brane congurations are similar.

by dening u = 2q5r, the above equation becomes a sum of two radial
laplace operators in at space

hv1v(vv) + u2u(u2u)ih4(v, u) = 0
eq.(4) can be further simplied by dening w2 = v2 + u2.

hw5w(w5w) + w2()ih4(w, ) = 0

(4)

(5)

where tan  = u/v, and () is the angular part of the laplace operator. a
solution with no  dependence is h4 = 1 + q4/w4 which in the near horizon
limit, q4  w4, gives according to eq.(1) the following sugra solution

the eld theory described by this conguration should be an n = 2, four di-
mensional n5
i=1su(n4) supersymmetric gauge theory with n5 hyper-multiplets
in the bi-fundamental representation, (ni, ni+1), where i = n5+1 is identied
with i = 1, since x6 is compact. this eld theory is conformal (nf = 2nc for

3

each of the gauge groups in the product), as is obvious from the sugra so-
lution, which contains an ads part. we consider solutions that depend only
on r, v because we wish to preserve the so(3)r  so(2)v isometry, which ac-
cording to the ads/cft duality should be identied with the r-symmetry
of the gauge theory.

we now want to write the sugra solution in terms of eld theory vari-

ables, namely the energy scale and gy m .

q4  g2

y m n42

q5  n51/2

(7)

since the eld theory is 3+1 dimensional, gy m is dimensionless. we also
note that there seem to be two energy scales in the solution, r = r/ and
v = v/. however, because v and r do not enter symmetrically in the
denition of w, we cannot at the same time keep r and v xed when taking
  0. we will work only with the combination of the two, w = w/ and
sin . note, however, that w = v2 + 4q5r does not have the interpretation
of the length of a stretched open string.

the 10 dimensional geometric description is only valid when the string
coupling gs = e, and the curvature of the ads part in string units are small.
thus as in [16], we can deduce the energies at which we can use this dual
description. in this case the dilaton and curvature are only functions of sin ,
which means that the geometric description is valid for: e  1 and r  1.

when sin   0 we have two options. one is to elevate this solution to
m-theory. we get a conguration of two m5 branes, one of which is smeared
over the (6,10) directions, and localized in 789, and the other localized in
all its transverse directions (45,789). this solution is described by the same
harmonic functions as before, since the harmonic superposition rule (m5 
m5) in 11 dimensions gives the same laplace equation as the 10 dimensional
one.

this description does not give anything new, since the curvature still diverges
when sin   0.
we can also go to the t-dual conguration. by making a t duality in the
6 direction we get n4 d3 branes smeared in the 6 direction and localized on
a singular compact space, x. the new metric and dilaton are derived from
the original ones using t-duality rules [14].

where ds2
x turns out to be a zn5 orbifold of s5, where the orbifold acts on
the s3 (6789) part of eq.(6). the connection between the ns brane and
an 1 singularities, which are described by this metric, and the eld content
of this theory were discussed in [17, 18, 19, 20].
in the t-dual picture it
is possible to generalize the solution to a near extremal brane in the usual
way by g00  g00f (w) and gww  gwwf 1(w). one can now t-dualize back
to the original conguration and obtain the solution for the near extremal
brane intersection. this conguration is not expected to be stable. one
should note that the radial coordinate w does not have the interpretation of
distance from the d3 in transverse space as in maldacenas original solution
[15], since w2 = v2 + 4q5r.

2.2 ns  d3
the next conguration we shall consider is an intersection of n3 localized
d3 branes with n5 ns branes smeared over the 6 direction. the sugra
solution can be derived in much the same way as in the previous case. we
know the near horizon behavior of h5 = q5/r and thus the equation for h3
is:

h345 + h 1

5 789ih3(v, r) = 0

(11)
again we substitute u = 2q5r, look for solutions that depend only on
u, v in order to keep the so(3)r  so(3)v isometry that will correspond
to an r-symmetry, and write eq.(11) as a 7 dimensional at space laplace
operator.

hw6w(w6w) + w2()ih3(w, ) = 0

(12)

5

the solution that has no  dependence is h3 = 1 + q3/w5/2 and we shall
work in the near horizon limit. the sugra solution follows, as before, from
eq.(1) :

note that, unlike the ns  d4 solution, this metric does not describe a
product space with an ads part, thus the corresponding eld theory will not
be conformal.

the eld theory described by this conguration should be a n5

i=1su(n3)
gauge theory in d=2+1 dimensions with 8 super-symmetries and n5 hyper-
multiplets in the (ni, ni+1) representations. the eld theory description is
valid where g2
y m n3. the 10 dimensional
geometric dual is valid when the string coupling, as well as, the 10 dimen-
sional curvature in string units, are small. to see that we rst write the
solution in terms of the eld theory variables, w = w/ and n3, n5.

when the string coupling becomes large we can go to the s-dual description.
the resulting sugra solution is just h 1/2
times the original, and the
dilaton is just .

we can also t-dualize along the 6 direction thus getting n3 d2 branes
smeared over 6, and localized on a singularity. the resulting sugra so-

x is a zn5 orbifold of s6. as in the d4 case, the zn5 orbifold acts
where now ds2
only on the s3 (6789) part of the transverse space. this solutions resembles
the solution found in [16] for d2 branes in at space, where the original d6
is now orbifolded, and w is not the naive distance from the d2 brane. again
we can generalize to a near extremal solution and t-dualize back to get the
near extremal solution of the intersection.

2.3 ns  d2
the next conguration we shall discuss is the intersection of n2 localized d2
branes with n5 ns branes. h5 is the same as in the two previous cases, thus
the equation for h2 is:

hw7w(w7w) + w2()ih2(w, ) = 0

(18)

the solution with no  dependence is h2 = 1 + q2/w6, thus getting the
following sugra solution:

the eld theory is a 1+1 dimensional n5

tion theory when w  gy mn2. we can express q2, q5 in terms of eld

theory variables as

thus the geometric description will be valid when

(21)

the solution can be elevated to m-theory, where we nd an intersection of a

the same harmonic functions

(23)

the t-dual solution resembles the solution found for a d1 brane in at space
[16], with the original d7 orbifolded.

2.4 ns  d1
the last conguration that we describe in this section has no apparent eld
theory dual. a d1-brane along the 6 direction intersecting a smeared ns
brane is described by the function h1(v, r) that obeys:
5 789ih1(v, r) = 0

h12345 + h 1

(24)

using similar techniques as in the previous cases, we change variables to w, 
and get the following equation:

hw8w(w8w) + w2()ih1(w, ) = 0

(25)

a solution with no  dependence is:

ds2 =

as in the case of a d3  ns, we can map this solution to its s-dual by
multiplying the metric by h 1/2
and taking   . we can also t-dualized
to get a d0 smeared in the 1 direction and localized on an orbifold singularity.
in [16] it was speculated that the solution of n d0 is dual to super-symmetric
quantum mechanics.

5

3 semi-localized dp branes

we now turn to congurations in which the dp brane is smeared in the
world volume of the ns brane. we shall nd an explicit solution for d1 
ns. solutions for dp-branes up to p=4 will follow by t duality.
in the following construction the ns brane spans (12345), and is com-
pletely localized in (6789). the d1 (6) is localized in (789), but is smeared
in (12345). thus the harmonic function of the d1 brane does not depend
on x12345 and should obey 789h1 = 0. this gives h1 = 1 + q1/r. in the
near horizon limit we neglect the 1 in h1. thus h5 satises a curved space
laplace equation:

by dening u = 2q1r we get:

h6 + h 1

1 789ih5(x, r) = 0

6 + u3u(u3u)ih5(x, u) = 0
h2

eq.(28) can be written using w2 = x2

6 + u2 and tan  = u/x6.

hw4w(w4w) + w2()ih5(w, ) = 0

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

we shall concentrate on solutions that have no  dependence, h5 = 1 +
q5/w3. this solution can be generalized to:

h5 = 1 +

n5

xi=1

i

((x  xi)2 + 4q1r)3/2

the full sugra solution is according to eq.(1) :

it can be seen that the procedure will be the same for all other dp branes
up to p=4. this is equivalent to t-dualizing along (12345). the eect of
this duality is just gii  1/gii. the case of an ns localized within a d6
brane was considered from another point of view in [9, 11]. it is also related
by t-duality to the solutions shown here. since in these solution the ns-
brane is localized, we expect the corresponding eld theory to live on the
ns-brane. this eld theory will have a rr background from the dp-branes,
and 8 supersymmetries. we shall not explore such eld theories here.

4 fully localized solutions

in this section we shall display some solutions corresponding to fully local-
ized intersections of ns and dp branes. these solutions cannot be written
in terms of elementary functions. the problem is basically the same as
with semi localized intersections. the branes should be described by two
functions, hp, h5, that depend on relative, as well as, overall transverse di-
rections. we shall start with the d4  ns conguration. the derivations
for other congurations will follow along the same lines.
the system of equations one should solve in order to get a solution of a

localized intersection is (from eq.(1)):

hh545 + h46 + 789ihi(v, x6, r) = 0
in the semi localized case one of the equations was triv-
where i = 4, 5.
ially solved by taking hi = 1 + qi/r, and smearing in directions relatively
transverse to that brane.

(32)

if we assume that both functions have a q/r dependence then we can
dene hi = (1/r)hi. this choice of r dependence cannot be considered
general, but as we shall see it simplies the equations in a way that enables
us to nd some solutions. the new equation is:

hh545 + h46ihi(v, x6) = 0

(33)

we now choose one of the functions to solve the equation in a trivial way.
for example we may choose h4 = ln v, where, as before, v2 = x2
5. this
brings the equation for h5 to the form:

4 + x2

hh5v + ln v6ih5(v, x6) = 0

(34)

10

this equation can be solved by separation of variables h5(v, x6) = f1(v)f2(x6):

d2f1
dv2 +

1
v

df1
dv  c ln v = 0
d2f2
2 = 0
dx2
6

+ cf 2

where c is some constant. the rst of these equations gives:

f1(v) =

c
4

v2(ln v  1) + a + b ln v

where a, b are constants. the second equation give an elliptic integral

x6 = z

df2(x6)
3 f 3

2 (x6) + d

q 2c

(35)

(36)

(37)

in a similar way we can choose h5 = x6, thus the 6 part of eq.(33) is solved
trivially, leaving the equation for h4 to be

hx645 + h46ih4(v, x6) = 0

(38)

this equation can also be solved by separation of variables, h4 = g1(v)g2(x6).

d2g1
dv2 +

1
v

1 = 0

dg1
dv  cg2
d2g2
dx2
6

+ cx6 = 0

(39)

the second equation has a simple solution, g2(x) =  c
the equation for g1(v) is not solved in terms of simple analytic functions.

6 + ax6 + b, while

6 x3

we can now go on to congurations with p=3,2,1. for example in the

p=3 case we may choose h3 = 1/v, thus the equation for h5 is

hh5345 + v16ih5(v, x6) = 0

(40)

in all cases after the separation of variables the equation for f2(x6) will be
the same.

it is not clear to us at the present time what is the eld theory which is
dual to these kind of solutions. however, solutions of fully localized brane
intersections are essential if one wants to address eld theory problems with
arbitrary gauge couplings and matter contents.

5 summary and discussion

we have displayed solutions of semi-localized intersecting ns and dp-branes.
given the metrics of these intersections, one can learn about the eld theory
duals to these congurations by calculating wilson loops. for example, the
case of the d4  ns will be conformal since it factors into an ads5  x 5.
note that as long as the ads part exists the wilson loop calculation will be
the same, regardless of the nature of x 5. the same is also true for the rest
of the congurations, that the nature of the eld theory is determined by
the part in the metric corresponding to the brane world volume coordinates,
while the number of supersymmetries and matter content are determined by
the nature of x. the solutions for dp-branes intersecting ns branes were
shown to be dual to d(p-1)-branes on singular backgrounds.

similar solutions for dp-branes intersecting dp-branes can be found using
it is, however, not clear what eld theories a

the techniques shown here.
general intersection describes.
