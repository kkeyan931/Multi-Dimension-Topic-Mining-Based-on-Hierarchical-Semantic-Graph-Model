abstract

duality between n=1 supersymmetric gauge theories(seibergs duality)
is geometrized, in the framework of ads/cft correspondences. it is shown
that seibergs duality corresponds to monodromy of wrapped d5 branes on
the homology cycles of a generalized conifold where d3 branes are located.
the celebrated nc = nf  nc, nf = nf rule is reproduced and a braid group
structure in a sequence of dualities, is found.

recently, there has been great progress in our understanding of the be-
havior of four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, in the strong cou-
pling regime. in particular, maldacena[1] conjectured that n=4 supersym-
metric gauge theory (conformal eld theory) in four dimensions, is dual to
type iib string theory on a product of ve dimensional anti-de sitter(ads5)
space and ve dimensional sphere(s 5). (ads/cft correspondence). sub-
sequently, klebanov and witten[2] generalized ads/cft correspondence
to a supersymmetric gauge theory with less supersymmetry, i. e. n=1 .
there they showed that a certain n=1 supersymmetric gauge theory, which
arises as a eld theory of parallel threebranes near a conifold singularity
of a six dimensional calabi-yau space y6 corresponds to type iib string
theory on ads5  x5, with x5 being a ve dimensional einstein manifold,
(su(2) su(2))/u(1). (see also ref.[3]) gubser et al.[4] and lopez[5] gener-
alized this correspondences to a class of more general conifolds y6 classied
according to simply-laced lie algebras of ade type, which is a cone over
x5 obtained by blowing up an orbifold singularity of s 5/, with  being
diescrete group classied according to the same type of the simply-laced lie
algebra. these correspondences suggest that the strong coupling behavior
of n=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions are encoded in
geometry of corresponding conifold singularity. there are dualities between
n=1 supersymmetric gauge theories(seibergs dualities)[6] where the dynam-
ics in the strong coupling regime are responsible. therefore, it is tempting
to conjecture that seibergs duality can be geometrized to an operation on
the conifold singularity by means of ads/cft correspondences. this is the
problem which we address in this paper. we will nd that seibergs duality
corresponds to a geometrical operation on the conifold which is a monodromy
of homology 2-cycles of the conifold called picard-lefschetz monodromy. if
there are d5 branes wrapped on homology 2-cycles, in addition to a stack of
d3 branes, we will have a non-trivial seibergs duality and obtain the cele-
brated rule, nc = nf  nc, nf = nf . moreover, we will nd a braid group
structure in a sequence of seibergs dualities by virtue of this geometrization.
following references [4],[5],we review n=1 supersymmetric eld theories
which arise from d3 branes on generalized conifold of ade-type. consider n
d3 branes located at an orbifold singularity c2/ c, where  is a discrete
subgroup of su(2) classied by simply-laced lie algebra ade. the eective
eld theory on d3 branes is a four-dimensional n=2 supersymmetric gauge
theory with a product gauge group, qk
i=0 su(nni), where, k is the rank
of the lie algebra corresponding to the discrete group , and ni = dimri

2

with ri being the i-th representation of .
in the corresponding simply-
laced lie algebra, ni is identical to dynkin label of the node of extended
dynkin diagram. the matters which arise are aij copies of hypermultiplets
in the bi-fundamental represenations, (nin, njn) where aij comes from the
decomposition c2  ri = jcaijrj. the orbifold c2/ can be represented as
an algebraic variety, by a hypersurface dened by the equation f = 0 in c3
parametrized by three complex numbers x,y and z.

f = xk+1 + y2 + z2,
f = xk1 + xy2 + z2,
f = x4 + y3 + z2,
f = x3y + y3 + z2,
f = x5 + y3 + z2.

the equation f = 0 is invariant under the c action, x  x, y  y, z 
z where,  = 1,  = k+1
2 , in ak case,for instance, since f scales
as hf, withh = k + 1, under this action.

2 ,  = k+1

an n=1 supersymmetric theory is obtained if the orbifold singularity is
resolved to become a non-compact calabi- yau manifold y with a conifold-
like singularity. the orbifold singularity is deformed by parameters ts, which
is then bered on a complex plane parametrized by . the dening equation
of this generalized conifold is then given by;

f(, x, y, z) = hf(

x
 ,

y
 ; t) + z2 = 0.

for instance, the holomorphic function f for  = ak is;

f(, x, y, z) = xk+1 + 2t2xk1 + ... + ktkx + y2 + z2

let us nd the eective eld theory on the branes located at this generalized
conifold. the t-dual brane conguration pictures[7],[8],[9] are more conve-
nient for this purpose. let n d3 branes (world-volume in 0123 directions) be
located at the orbifold singularity of ale space (ak-type, for simplicity)with
coordinates 6789. perform t-duality along 6ith direction, corresponding to
the u(1) isometry of the ale space.[7] then we obtain type ii a string with

3

k+1 ns 5 branes (world-volume in 012345 directions). d3 branes are trans-
formed into d4 branes (01236).the eective eld theory on the d4 branes,
is n=2 supersymmetric gauge theory with the gauge group su(n)k+1. if,
n d3 branes are located at a generalized conifold,[8],[9] instead of ale[7],
we obtain, k+1 ns 5 branes rotated in the complex surface spanned by,
x = x8 + ix9 and  = x4 + ix5. in this case, scalar elds in adjoint repre-
sentations of su(n)k+1 become massive and supersymmetry is broken from
n=2 to n=1. the spacing of i-th and (i+1)-th ns 5 branes in 6-th direction,
is related to the coupling constant gi of the i-th factor su(n)i of the product
gauge group, by;

x6(nsi+1)  x6(nsi)

gs

=

1
g2
i

(9)

where gs is the string coupling constant. the spacing in 7-th direction, on
the other hand, is related to the coecient of fayet-iliopoulos(fi) term i of
the i-th gauge factor through,

x7(nsi+1)  x7(nsi) = i.

(10)

seibergs duality with respect to the i-th gauge group factor of the product
group corresponds to an interchange of i-th and (i+1)-th ns 5 branes by the
following procedure.[8],[10],[11] the i-th and the (i+1)-th ns 5 branes come
close together in 6-th direction until x6(nsi+1)  x6(nsi) reaches a small
real value . in the eld theory side, the coupling costant gi becomes larger
and larger until 1
. then the fi term i turns on in order to avoid
g2
passing through the innite coupling constant point gi = . then gi and i
vary as;

reaches 
gs

i

gs
g2
i

+ ii = eit.

(11)

where, t runs from 0 to 1. at t=1, fi term is turned o and the order
of two ns5 branes are interchanged in 6-th direction, since 6-th and 7-th
coordinates of ns5 branes change as;

[x6(nsi+1)  x6(nsi)] + i[x7(nsi+1)  x7(nsi)] = eit.

(12)

finally the separation of ns5 branes becomes larger and larger until the
gauge coupling constant comes back to the original value.

now let us come back to the original picture,

type ii b string
with n d3 branes at the conifold, by t-duality transformation. then,

i.e.

4

x6(nsi+1)x6(nsi) and x7(nsi+1)x7(nsi) are real and imaginary part of
complexied kahler class[k] of homology 2-cycles of the conifold. we nd that
the procedure corresponding to seibergs duality; two ns5 branes come clos
together, being interchanged, and go away, is a geometrical operation on the
singularity of the conifold, which is called picard-lefschetz monodromy.

picard-lefschetz monodromy of a singularity is dened as follows. see the
book by arnold et al.[12] for detail. this monodromy plays also a crucial role
in two-dimensional conformal eld theory[13]. consider generalized conifold
of ak-type dened by the equation;

f(, x, y, z) = 0

(13)

the level manifold of level   c, is dened by the equation, f(, x, y, z) =

. the critical points of the holomorphic function f is dened by,

f
x

= 0,

f
y

= 0,

f
z

= 0.

(14)

this is a k-th order algebraic equation which has k solutions; x = xi(i =
1, 2, ..., k), y = 0, z = 0. the values of the holomorphic function f at critical
points x = xi, are called critical values i(i = 1, ..., k). for example, for
 = ak

k+1

i =

y

j=1

(xi  j).

(15)

if the level value  starts from a non-critical value 0, goes around one of
the critical values i and comes back to the the original value 0, the level
manifold comes back to the original one but the homology cycles (vanishing
cycles) are reshued. the holomorphic function f is expanded around the
critical values;

then, i-th vanishing cycle i is[12]

f = i + w2

1 + w2

2 + w2
3.

(16)

(17)

where,   i is the complexied kahler class and s 2 is a unit two-sphere.

i = q  is 2,

s 2 = {(w1, w2, w3) |

3

x

j=1

5

w2
j = 1, imwj = 0}

(18)

the picard-lefschetz monodromy is the operation where the level value 
goes around a critical value i.

  i = 2e2it, f orsmall, t  [0, 1].

(19)

this implies that

since   i is the complex kahler class [k] of the i-th vanishing cycle.

q  i = eit

q  i = [k].

(20)

(21)

the change of complex kahler class [k] under the picard-lefschetz monodromy
is the same as that under the interchange of the i-th and (i+1)-th ns 5branes
in the t-dual picture, which corresponds to seibergs duality. thus we nd
that seibergs duality corresponds to picard-lefschetz monodromy of van-
ishing cycles of the corresponding conifold.

the gauge theory arising from n d3 branes at generalized conifold is
self-dual under the seibergs duality transformation. this implies that the
number of colors of the dual theory are the same as those of the original
theory. a non-trivial seibergs duality where the dual gauge group is dierent
from the original one is realized when d5 branes are wrapped on the vanishing
cycles (homology cycles) of the conifold. the wrapped d5 brane[14] has d3
brane charge which is the same as the wrapping number. therefore, if a
d5 brane is wrapped on th i-th vanishing cycle i, with wrapping number
mi, the eective d3 brane number is changed from n to n + mi. then the
i-th gauge group factor is changed from su(n)i to su(n + mi)i. under
the picard-lefschetz monodromy transformation, the vanishing cycles are
reshued, and wrapping numbers of d5 branes are changed accordingly. in
the eld theory side, this implies that the numberof colors is changed under
seibergs duality transformation.

let us consider a simple example; the generalized conifold of a3 type.
n d3 branes on this conifold give n=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with
the gauge group g = su(n)0  su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n)3. each gauge
group factor corresponds to the node of extended dynkin diagram of the lie
algebra a3. the generalized conifold of a3 type has three vanishing cycles
(homology 2-cycles) 1, 2 and 3, corresponding to su(n)1, su(n)2 and
su(n)3. if d5 branes wrap around 1, 2 and 3, with wrapping numbers
m1, m2 and m3, the gauge group is,

g = su(n)0  su(n + m1)1  su(n + m2)2  su(n + m3)3

(22)

6

there are three picard-lefschetz monodromy transformations h1, h2 and h3.
the transformation rules of vanishing cycles i, (i = 1, 2, 3) under hi, (i =
1, 2, 3) are calculated by use of picard-lefschetz formula[12].

hi(a) = a + (a  i)i

(23)

where intersections of two vanishing cycles i and j are represented by the
intersection matrix sij = i  j = aij where aij is the cartan matrix of
a3. hence,

sij =




2
1
1 2
0

0

1 2




the action of hi(i = 1, 2, 3) on j(j = 1, 2, 3) can be represented by the

monodromy matrix dened by the relation;

hi(j) = (hi)jkk

(24)

then,

h1 =

h2 =

h3 =

now seibergs duality transformation performed on i-th gauge group fac-
tor su(n + mi)i corresponds to i-th picard-lefschetz monodromy trans-
formation, represented by i-th monodromy matrix hi. by this matrix, the
vanishing cycles are transformed as;

then the wrapping numbers of d5 branes are changed accordingly;



j = (hi)jkk.

mjj  mj

j = mj(hi)jkk = m 

kk

7

(25)

(26)

hence;

m 

k = mj(hi)jk

(27)

if seibergs duality transformation is performed on the gauge group factor

su(n + m1)1, the corresponding monodromy matrix is h1. hence,

m 

2 = mj(h1)j2 = m2, m 

3 = mj(h1)j3 = m3.

(28)

1 = mj(h1)j1 = m2  m1, m 
and the dual group turns out to be;
g = su(n)0  su(n + m2  m1)1  su(n + m2)2  su(n + m3)3. (29)
under this duality transformation, coupling constant of the gauge group
factor with the sux 1, becomes large, wich should then be regaded as the
color group. therefore, the numbers of colors and avors of the original theory
are, nc = n + m1 and nf = 2n + m2, respectively,and those of the dual
theory are nc = n + m  2  m1 and nf = 2n + m2, respectively.

note that the rule, nc = nf  nc, nf = nf is satised in this example.
seibergs dual on group factor with the suces 2 and 3 can be taken in

the same fashion, and the above rule is satised also in these cases.

a general expression for the dual gauge theory can now be written. let
the n=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with the gauge group g = su(n)0 
su(n1n + m1)1  ...  su(nkn + mk)k be the eld theory which arises
from n d3 branes on the conifold given by a below up of c2/  c, with 
being a discrete subgroup corresponding to a rank k simply-laced lie algebra,
with dynkin labels ni, and d5 branes wrap around i-th(i=1,...,k) homology 2-
cycles with wrapping numbermi. the matters arise as hypermultiplets in the
bi-fundamental representations (nin + mi, njn + mj), if i-th and j-th gauge
group factors are adjacent in the the sense that the nodes are connected by
spokes in the corresponding extended dynkin diagram. then the dual theory
is determined as follows. the intersection matrix of homology 2-cycles of the
conifold is;

sij = i  j = aij

(30)

where aij is the cartan matrix of the lie algebra. then the i-th mon-

odromy matrix hi can be calculated by picard-lefschetz theorem;

hi(a) = a + (a  i)i.

(31)

8

now if we perform seibergs duality transformation on i-th gauge group
factor, the homology 2-cycles i are transformed by i-th monodromy matrix
hi. then the dual gauge group g is,

g = su(n)0  su(n1n + m 

1)1  ...  su(nkn + m 

k)k

(32)

where
m 

 = m(hi), and(hi) :  component of i-th monodromy matrix.
the dual matters arise as hypermutiplets in the bi-fundamental representa-
tions (nin + m 
j) if i-th and j-th gauge group factors are adjacent
in the sense that the nodes are connected by spokes in the corresponding
extended dynkin diagram.

i, njn + m 

the geometrization of seibergs duality given above provides us with a
deep insight in properties of the duality. we nd a new structure in a se-
quence of seibergs dualities, i.e. the braid group structure. it is known
in mathematics[12] and conrmed easily in simple examples, that the mon-
odromy matrices hi satisfy the following relations;

hi+1hihi+1 = hihi+1hi

hihj = hjhi

for

| i  j | 2

(33)

(34)

(35)

this is the algebra of braid group with k strands. this fact combined
with the relation between seibergs duality and picard-lefschetz monodromy,
shows that a sequence of seibergs dualities taken on the gauge group factors
of the product group must have the same braid group structure. in partic-
ular, we nd from the relation of the braid algebra that successive seibergs
duality transformations performed on an adjacent gauge group factors do
not commute, whereas those on non-adjacent group factors commute. for
example, let the gauge group of the original theory be;

su(n)0  su(n + m1)1  su(n + m2)2  su(n + m3)3.

(36)

from the braid algebra, it follows that the seibergs duality performed on
the group factor su(n + m1)1 rst and then on su(n + m2)2, and the
seibergs duality performed in the reversed order, i.e. on the gauge group
factor su(n + m2)2 rst and then on su(n + m1)1, give dierent theories.
because, in the former case, the resulting group is

9

su(n)0  su(n + m 

1)1  su(n + m 

2)2  su(n + m 
3)3

with,

whereas in the latter case, the resulting group is,

m 

i = mk(h1)kj(h2)ji

m 

i = mk(h2)kj(h1)ji.

(37)

(38)

(39)

the resulting groups are dierent in two cases since h1h2 6= h2h1
however, if we perform seibergs duality transformation three times suc-

cesively, in the distinct two ways given below, we reach the same theory.

1. perform seibergs duality on su(n + m1)1 rst, then on su(n + m2)2

and nally on su(n + m1)1.

2. perform seibergs duality on su(n + m2)2 rst, then on su(n + m1)1

and nally on su(n + m2)2.

this fact follows from the relation,

h1h2h1 = h2h1h2

(40)

in conclusion, we have geometrized dualities between n=1 supersym-
metric gauge theories in four dimensions (seibergs duality), by means of
ads/cft correspondence. it turned out that seibergs duality can be in-
terpreted as a geometrical operation on the conifold, called picard-lefschetz
monodromy. the homology 2-cycles of the conifold are transformed by this
monodromy operation. if d5 branes wrap around these 2-cycles, and have
d3 brane charges corresponding to the wrapping numbers, the eective d3
brane numbers are changed, by the monodromy transformation. in the eld
theory side, this implies that the number of colors changes upon seibergs du-
ality transformation and it turned out that the rule nc = nf  nc, nf = nf
is satised. furthermore, we obtained a general expression for the dual gauge
group, when seibergs duality is taken on one of the gauge group factor of
the product gauge group of the n=1 supersymmetric gauge theory arising
from the eld theory on d3 branes on generalized conifold singularity of
ade type. moreover, we found a braid group structure in a sequence of
seibergs dualities taken on the gauge group factors of the product gauge
group, by virtue of the geometrization of seibergs duality in the framework
of ads/cft correspondences.
