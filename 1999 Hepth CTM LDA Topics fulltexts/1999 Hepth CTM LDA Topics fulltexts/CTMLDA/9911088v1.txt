abstract

we compute the leading order perturbative correction to the static potential
in n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. we show that the perturbative
expansion contains infrared logarithms which, when resummed, become log-
arithms of the coupling constant. the resulting correction goes in the right
direction to match the strong coupling behavior obtained from the ads/cft
correspondence. we nd that the strong coupling extrapolation of the sum of

ladder diagrams goes as pg2n , as in the supergravity approach.

yang-mills theory with n = 4 supersymmetry in four dimensions is an extremely
interesting quantum eld theory. it is a conformal eld theory for any value of its
coupling constant and is conjectured to have a montonen-olive strong-weak coupling
duality. it is now believed to have an additional, exact duality to type iib superstring
theory on an ads5  s 5 background. this duality, which is known as the ads/cft
correspondence [1, 2, 3, 4], is an explicit realization of the long anticipated but elusive
mapping between gauge theory and string theory [5]. in this duality, the weak cou-
pling, classical limit of string theory corresponds to the large n limit of gauge theory.
classical string theory in its low energy, weak curvature limit is accurately described
by classical iib supergravity. this corresponds to the large n, large t hooft coupling
(denoted   g2n) limit of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. this gives
a new, computationally tractable scheme for extracting the large  limit of certain
correlators in n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory.

it is dicult to check the results of these computations since the only other
quantitative approach to yang-mills theory is its perturbative expansion in small
g2. an important exception is correlation functions which are protected from gain-
ing quantum corrections by non-renormalization theorems. the agreement between
supergravity calculations of these correlators and weak coupling results is a powerful
consistency check of the ads/cft correspondence [4]. in fact, some surprising new
non-renormalization conjectures were found in this way [6, 7].

however, the ads/cft correspondence predicts a generically non-trivial depen-
dence of various quantities on the coupling constant. the sum over planar diagrams
which emerges in the large n limit of yang-mills theory has a nite radius of con-
vergence [8]. this suggests that the dependence of various quantities on the coupling
constant is smooth near  = 0. furthermore, since evidence from matrix models
suggests that the singularity in the sum of planar graphs usually occurs for negative
 [9], one might extrapolate this smooth behavior to the strong coupling limit, so that
some quantities have a smooth interpolation between  = 0 and  = . an example
is the free energy of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory at nite temperature
which, because of conformal invariance, has the form

f/v = f (g2, n)2n 2t 4/6.

in the large n limit f is a function of the t hooft coupling , which, to agree with
perturbative computation, must go to 1 at small  and, to agree with the ads/cft
correspondence, must go to 3/4 as  goes to innity [10]. smoothness of this function
implies that its perturbative expansion has alternating signs and that corrections to

2

the supergravity result are positive. explicit calculations conrmed that this is indeed
the case: for large  [11]

and, for small  [12],

f =

the latter expression contains the slight surprise that the nal term is non-analytic
in small . this non-analyticity comes from infrared divergences that occur at nite
temperature.

it is interesting to ask whether infrared divergences lead to non-analyticity in
other quantities. if we take the duality to the iib superstring seriously, this would
imply something about the strong curvature limit of tree level string theory. local
operators and extensive variables such as the free energy in yang-mills theory are
related to the low-energy supergravity degrees of freedom in string theory. an object
which couples more directly to stringy degrees of freedom is the wilson loop. the
loop operator which is a source for classical strings is [13]

w (c) =

it contains a coupling to the six scalar elds i of the n = 4 supermultiplet (with
i, i = 1, . . . , 6 a point on the 5-sphere, 2
i = 1) as well as the familiar dependence
on the yang-mills eld. it is related to the holonomy of the wavefunction of a heavy
particle with the quantum numbers of a w-boson.

the simplest quantity which can be extracted from the wilson loop is the inter-
action potential between static w-bosons. for this, we consider a rectangular loop
of length t and width l and the limit

v (l) =  lim

conformal symmetry of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory implies that

v (l) =

and, in the large n limit, the eective coulomb charge  is a function of the t hooft
coupling .

the exchange of scalar bosons mediates an attractive force which is equal to that
due to gauge elds, so that, at weak coupling, the potential is twice as large as

3

that in pure yang-mills theory. at large , the ads/cft correspondence predicts a
square-root dependence of the coulomb charge [13], so that

if () is a smooth function, we expect that perturbative corrections should decrease
the weak coupling value of the coulomb charge. in this letter, we shall check this
assertion by computing the correction to () to the next order in . similar com-
putations for non-supersymmetric yang-mills theory have been done in [14, 15].

constants of the su(n) lie algebra (we use the normalization of generators tr t at b =
ab/2). the a are four-component majorana fermion elds transforming as a four
dimensional representation of the so(6) r-symmetry group. we use feynman gauge
where the gluon propagator is d(x) = g2/42x2, and consider the contribution
of all planar diagrams to the wilson loop to order g4. we have found that individual
diagrams contain ultraviolet divergences, which cancel when all diagrams to order
g4n 2 are summed. nevertheless, the sum of all one-loop contributions to the wilson
loop expectation value does not yield a well-dened correction to the potential. the
planar ladder diagram contains an extra logarithm of t /l:

this logarithmic term threatens to ruin perturbation theory as well as the denition
of static potential (2). a similar behavior (beginning at order g6) has been observed
for wilson loops in ordinary yang-mills theory. according to [15] the logarithm is
due to an infrared divergence coming from soft gluons traveling along the wilson loop
for a long period of (euclidean) time t  t . diagrams with more soft gluons will
have a higher degree of divergence so it is necessary to take all orders into account.
it was argued in [15] that the eect of the soft gluon resummation is to cut o the

divergent integral over t at t  1/. prototypically, an integral like r dt/t is replaced

4

by r (dt/t) exp(t). the perturbative expansion of the latter produces successively

worse infrared divergences, but resummation of perturbation series makes the result
nite and replaces ln(t /l) by ln(1/).

the consistent resummation prescription which removes the infrared divergences
in the static potential is to sum up all (planar) ladder diagrams. the sum of ladder
diagrams can be obtained from a bethe-salpeter equation, which in diagrammatic
form is

the static potential is extracted from (s, t ) as v (l) =  limt
t ln (t, t ). we
note here that, generally, the sum of ladder diagrams will not produce a gauge invari-
ant result. however, the few leading terms (the two terms in (9)) are independent of
the choice of gauge.

and the boundary conditions (0, t ) = 1 = (s, 0). this equation is separable in the
variables x = (s  t )/l and y = (s + t )/l. the laplace transform of  can be
expressed in terms of eigenfunctions of the schrodinger equation

the asymptotic behavior of (x, y) at large y is determined by the rightmost singu-
larity of its laplace transform in the complex p plane. the right hand side of (8)
has poles at the eigenvalues of the schrodinger equation. the pole with the largest

5

real component is associated with the ground state energy. consequently, the sum
of ladder diagrams grows exponentially: (0, y)  exp(0y/2) = exp(0t /l). thus,
the coulomb charge is given by the ground state eigenvalue () = 0().

it is straightforward to nd () in both the large and small  limits.

if  is
small, it is necessary to rescale x by , so that (z) = (z/). in that case, the limit
of (7) is

(z)

(z)(z) =

using the lowest eigenvalue of the delta-function potential, we reproduce the leading
behavior, () = /4 +    . a straightforward perturbative computation produces
the next order,

including the logarithm. there is also a (smaller) term of order 2 which, to this
order, has a gauge dependent coecient. in any case, infrared divergences make it
impossible to compute the term of order 2 in perturbation theory.

even though the result is not independent of the choice of gauge, it is interesting
to study the large  behavior of the potential arising in the innite sum of ladder
diagrams. if  is large, the potential in (7) can be expanded in x about x = 0. the
wavefunction in the quadratic approximation is a gaussian

(x)  e

x2/4,

(10)

whose ground state energy is 2 = /2 +    . this approximation is consistent; the
expectation value of corrections to the quadratic approximation for the ground state
energy is of higher order in 1/. this yields the strong coupling behavior

() =


  1 + o(1/),

(11)

which reproduces the same power of the coupling constant as in the the ads/cft
computation in (4), but has the wrong coecient. the source of the discrepancy
in the coecient is clear: the ladder diagrams do not contain all of the important
contributions at strong coupling.

the main result of this letter is the one-loop correction to the static potential (9).
it is satisfying to see that this correction goes in the right direction to match the
prediction of the ads/cft correspondence.
(the sub-leading corrections on the
supergravity side have been studied in [16].) we also found that the  dependence

6

of the eective coulomb charge predicted by the ads/cft correspondence arises in
the resummed perturbation theory and that 1/ is a natural expansion parameter
at strong coupling, just as in the supergravity approach. these results are in good
agreement with the ads/cft correspondence.

the infrared divergences due to soft gauge and scalar bosons in the static potential
appear to be stronger in n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory than in qcd.
these divergences make the coulomb potential non-analytic at weak coupling and
lead to the breakdown of perturbation theory beyond second order. this behavior is
similar to what happens at nite temperature, but the infrared divergences are milder
in the case of the static potential and have a dierent physical origin.
