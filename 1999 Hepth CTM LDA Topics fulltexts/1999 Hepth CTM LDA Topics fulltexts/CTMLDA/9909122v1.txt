abstract

we analyze the structure of singularities, mordell-weil lattices and torsions of
a rational elliptic surface using string junctions in the background of 12 7-branes.
the classication of the mordell-weil lattices due to oguiso-shioda is reproduced
in terms of the junction lattice. in this analysis an important role played by the
global structure of the surface is observed. it is then found that the torsions in the
mordell-weil group are generated by the fraction of loop junctions which represent

the imaginary roots of the loop algebra be9. from the structure of the mordell-weil

lattice we nd 7-brane congurations which support non-bps junctions carrying
conserved abelian charges.

1 introduction

in our previous paper [1], and in a related work [2], elliptic curves have been constructed

for the 7-brane congurations on which the ane lie algebras ben (1  n  8) and been

(n = 0, 1) are realized. upon deriving these curves from a rational elliptic surface s,

we recognize that the brane picture is very ecient to deal with the geometry of s. in

this construction, however, we have only probed the local geometry of s with the aid of

the 7-brane technology. our purpose in this paper is to show that 7-branes and string

junctions stretched among them precisely capture the global structure of a rational elliptic

surface.

to explain what kind of global structures we will discuss, let us start with briey

reviewing the heterotic string/f-theory duality. duality between f-theory on an elliptic
k3 surface sf and the heterotic string theory on a two-torus t 2 has been the source of

inspiring various duality relations in lower dimensions [3, 4, 5]. in the type iib picture,

singularities of sf are described in terms of coalescing 7-branes which are in general
mutually non-local. the sub-lattice 18,2 of the 22-dimensional homology lattice 19,3 of

1

k3 is spanned by junctions stretched among 7-branes [6]. when the size of t 2 is very

large, sf can be viewed as consisting of two rational elliptic surfaces s1, s2, each of which

may be associated to one of the heterotic e8  e8 gauge groups [7]. more precisely, in

this regime, s1 and s2 intersect along an elliptic curve e whose complex structure is
identied as that of t 2 on the heterotic side. while keeping e xed, then, deformations

of the complex structure of si are dual to deformations of the corresponding e8 bundle
on t 2 [7, 8].

the gauge symmetry in the heterotic string is now understood in terms of shrinking

two-cycles in si, or equivalently coalescing 7-branes, on the f-theory side. as found in

[9, 10], while the resulting singularity xes the root lattice, and hence the gauge symmetry

algebra, the torsion part of the mordell-weil group plays a crucial role to determine the

gauge group. the mordell-weil group, as will be described in more detail in the text, is an

abelian group generated by rational sections of the elliptic bration, and decomposed into

its free part and its torsion part. when the torsion part is non-trivial the corresponding

gauge group acquires non-trivial 1, and thus there appears non-simply-connected gauge

groups [10].

thus it is seen that the mordell-weil group reects a global structure of a rational

elliptic surface. furthermore it is known that the mordell-weil group equipped with a

natural bilinear pairing possesses the lattice structure which is referred to as the mordell-

weil lattice [11]. the classication of the mordell-weil lattice of a rational elliptic surface

has already been completed, thanks to oguiso-shioda [12].

in this paper, describing the singularity structures of a rational elliptic surface s in

terms of 12 7-branes with trivial total monodromy, we will show that the junction lattices

on the 7-brane backgrounds precisely produce all the mordell-weil lattices of s as listed in

[12]. especially the torsion elements are found to be identied as the fraction of global

loop junctions which, on the other hand, are related to the imaginary roots of e-type

ane lie algebras.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we introduce some elementary arith-

metic of elliptic curves and the notion of the mordell-weil group of s using several explicit

examples of s presented as elliptic curves. in section 3, after a short review of 7-branes

and junctions, we determine the brane congurations which describe the structure of

2

the mordell-weil lattice given in [12]. in this calculation we recognize a non-trivial role

played by the global structure of the surface. in section 4, the charge integrality condi-

tion is re-considered to obtain the weight lattice and torsions from string junctions. in

particular, torsions are expressed as fractional loop junctions. finally we discuss possibly

stable non-bps states in f-theory on k3 on the basis of the structure of the mordell-weil

lattice.

2 preliminaries

2.1 mordell-weil group

consider an elliptic curve e dened over q

y2 = 4x3  g2x  g3,

g2, g3  q.

(2.1)

any cubic in p2 can be transformed into this canonical form. a point p = (x, y) on e is

called rational point if x, y  q, the totality of which is denoted as e(q). determination

of the structure of e(q) is a deep arithmetic problem. the fundamental fact is that e(q)

has a structure of an abelian group, known as the mordell-weil group [13].

in order to see the group law explicitly, let us recall that a point p = (x, y) on e is

parametrized by the weierstrass -function as x = (t), y = (t). the addition formulae

for  read

(s + t) = (s)  (t) +

1

(s + t) = (s)  (t) +

(s)  (t) !2
4 (s)  (t)
4  (s)  (t)
(s)  (t) !3

1

,

+ 3

(s)(t)  (t)(s)

(s)  (t)

. (2.2)

it is obvious that, given pi = (xi, yi) = ((ti), (ti))  e(q) with i = 1, 2, the sum
p3 = p1 + p2 dened by p3 = (x3, y3) = ((t1 + t2), (t1 + t2)) is also in e(q). the
special point at innity o = (, ) is regarded as the unit of this addition. the inverse

of p = (x, y) is given by p = (x, y).

when the curve e is expressed as a complex torus e = c/(z +  z), the addition is

nothing but the usual sum of complex numbers ti  e . note that if t1 + t2 + t3 = 0 in

3

e then

(t1) (t1) 1
(t2) (t2) 1
(t3) (t3) 1

det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= 0.

(2.3)

this means that three distinct points pi  e satisfy p1 + p2 + p3 = 0 if and only if they

are on the same line. this geometric rule of the addition, classically known to fermat

and euler, is applicable for any cubic which is not necessarily in the canonical form (2.1).

mordells theorem says that the group e(q) is nitely generated,

e(q)  zr  e(q)tor,

(2.4)

where the torsion part e(q)tor is generated by (at most two) generators p  e(q) such

that mp = o for some m  z>0 (see [10] and references therein).

2.2 elliptic surfaces

what we have described in the previous subsection can be readily generalized for other

eld k than q. the relevant case for our analysis in this paper is that k is a eld of

rational functions of one variable, namely k = c(z) = { a(z)/b(z) | a(z), b(z) polynomials

in z}. then the curve

y2 = x3 + f (z)x + g(z),

(2.5)

where f (z), g(z)  k, represents an elliptic surface s over p1 which is a family of elliptic
curves e = { (x, y) } parametrized by z  p1. every elliptic surface over p1 with section
can be recast in this form. at the point z on p1 where the discriminant  = 4f (z)3 +
27g(z)2 vanishes, the ber becomes singular. possible singular bers were classied by

kodaira, according to which the blowing-up diagram of each singularity is represented by

the dynkin diagram of a, d and e type [14]. in the iib brane picture, the singularities

correspond to the coinciding 7-branes [3].

now, a point p in the mordell-weil group e(k) is a solution p = (x(z), y(z)) of (2.5)

such that x(z), y(z)  k. in view of the elliptic surface s, a point p  e(k) is a rational

section of the elliptic bration. applying the addition formulae (2.2) berwise, we see

that e(k) has a structure of an abelian group.

4

in the following let us take several examples of elliptic surfaces and compute rational

sections to show the abelian group property explicitly. we note in passing that deter-

mining sections of elliptic surfaces is essential when one constructs the seiberg-witten

dierential in n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with matters [15, 16, 17]. in each

example below, no.  refers to the entry  of table 2 which will appear in section 3.

i = 1, 2, 3,

(2.19)

(2.20)

where ai are determined through (x  a1)(x  a2)(x  a3) = x3 + ux + v. these six sections
pi correspond to the six fundamental weights of the a2 algebra 1, (2  1) and

(2). by addition formulae (2.2), one can generate a section pl,m corresponding to
a weight  = l1 + m2 for each (l, m)  z2. thus we see that e(k)  z2 as an
abstract group, but it has a more detailed structure as a lattice e(k) = a
2. here a
lattice is introduced as a free abelian group l = zr with a symmetric bilinear form

( , ) : l  l  z. the equality e(k) = a

2 means the isomorphism as a lattice. the
bilinear form on e(k) is dened by the height pairing which can be explicitly evaluated

in terms of an intersection pairing on an elliptic surface s, see next section.

finally it is mentioned that, extending the computation in [17], we have shown that

the seiberg-witten dierential for the curve (2.18) can be constructed so that it has the

poles with residues located on sections (3.6). the details may appear elsewhere.

3 mordell-weil lattice vs. junction lattice

3.1 mordell-weil lattice

let us start with recapitulating what we have discussed in the previous section, then we

introduce the notion of the mordell-weil lattice, following [11]. we take an elliptic curve

e dened over a eld k

y2 = x3 + f x + g,

f, g  k.

(3.1)

a point p = (x, y)  k 2 on the curve e is called k-rational point. let e(k) denote

a set of all the k-rational points plus the point at innity o = (, ). for given

(3.2)

(3.3)

with respect to this addition law, e(k) has a structure of abelian group, called the

mordell-weil group. the point at innity o  e(k) is the unit of this addition.

in this paper we are mainly concerned with the case of k = c(z) (the eld of rational
functions on z). then (3.1) is naturally considered as an elliptic surface s over p1, for

which the points p = (x(z), y(z))  e(k) represent the rational sections of this bration.

the kodaira classication of singular bers is presented in table 1. we denote by t the

lattice corresponding to the singular bers.

there exists a deep relation between the singularities t and the sections e(k), re-

ecting the global structure of the elliptic surface s. the essential idea in studying such

relation is to equip e(k) with the lattice structure which can be described in terms of

intersections on s.

the lattice structure, or the height pairing ( , ) of the mordell-weil group e(k)

was introduced by shioda using the intersection pairing [11]. the mordell-weil group

equipped with the height pairing is called the mordell-weil lattice. in theorem 8.1 [11],

the height pairing (p, q) for sections p, q  e(k) is explicitly calculated as follows:

(p, q) = p  o + q  o  p  q + (os) xv

contrv(p, q),

8

(p, p ) = 2(os) + 2p  o xv

contrv(p ),

(3.4)

where p  q denotes the intersection pairing, (os) is the arithmetic genus of s (= 1 for

rational elliptic surfaces) and contrv is the local contribution from each singular point v

contrv(p, q) =

if i = 0 or j = 0,

0,
(c 1
v )ij, otherwise

(3.5)

and contrv(p ) = contrv(p, p ). here cv is the cartan matrix (of nite type) corresponding

to the singularity at v and the indices i, j label the components of the singular bers with

which p or q intersects. the component intersecting with the zero section o is specied

by i = 0.

where deg (z) = dl,m = l2 + lm + m2, deg (z) = 1
deg (z) = 2

3 ] and
3 ] for l  m (mod 3) [ resp. otherwise ]. for this
section pl,m, the second formula in (3.4) can be checked since we evaluate (pl,m, pl,m) =
(l1 + m2)2 = 2

3dl,m, contrz=(pl,m) = 0 [ resp. 4

noting that the structure of the mordell-weil lattice e(k) is essentially determined

by the singularity lattice t , oguiso-shioda classied the mordell-weil lattice e(k) of a

rational elliptic surface [12]. this will be described in detail in section 3.3. our task is

now to gure out how the mordell-weil lattice e(k) and the singularity lattice t are

related to each other in terms of the junctions on rational elliptic surfaces.

3.2 brane congurations and junction lattice

we concentrate on a rational elliptic surface s dened by (3.1) where f = f (z) and

g = g(z) are some polynomials in z, and deg f  4, deg g  6 with  6= constant.

 in the homogeneous coordinates (x : y : z), the curve and sections are rewritten as zy 2 =
x 3 + f (z)xz 2 + g(z)z 3, p = (x : y : z) = (, , 3). hence, the intersection of p with zero-section
o = (0 : 1 : 0) is given by deg (z).

 in case of more general elliptic surfaces, elliptic k3 for instance, the junction lattice will contain

transcendental cycles also.

9

generically there exist 12 singular points zi where (zi) = 0. each singular ber at

z = zi has a local monodromy k[pi,qi] labeled by pi, qi  z. here the monodromy matrix

takes the form

k[p,q] =(cid:18) 1 + pq p2

1  pq(cid:19) ,

q2

(3.7)

corresponding to a vanishing cycle p + q with ,  being homology cycles of a ber

torus. physically a singular point is interpreted as the position of a 7-brane x[p,q] on

which a (p, q)-string with a boundary homologous to p + q can end [3]. among var-

ious (p, q) 7-branes x[p,q] it is convenient to express the representative ones as x[1,0] =

a, x[1,1] = b, x[1,1] = c. the kodaira singularities can be then described as a coales-

cence of collapsible sub-congurations of 7-branes, see table 1 [19, 20].

to specify a brane conguration, we place the 12 branes, say, on the real axis of the

z-plane and draw downwards the branch cuts emanating from the branes. thus, for a

brane conguration

we have the total monodromy

x[p1,q1]x[p2,q2]    x[p12,q12],

k = k[p12,q12]    k[p2,q2]k[p1,q1]

(3.8)

(3.9)

which should be trivial, i.e. k = 1, to describe a rational elliptic surface s. a standard

realization of such a brane conguration is [6]

be9 = a8bcbc.

(3.10)

a topological conguration of strings (or string junctions) associated to the branes

can be parameterized as

j =

12xi=1

qisi

or

j = (q1, q2, . . . , q12),

(3.11)

where si stands for the outgoing (pi, qi)-string starting at x[pi,qi] and qi is the net number
of outgoing (pi, qi)-strings. by denition the charges qi must be integral and are called

the invariant charges [19]. the total (p, q) charges of a string junction are

(p, q) =

12xi=1

qi(pi, qi).

figure 1: a string junction.

a junction represents a closed two-cycle in s if and only if its total charges vanish.

a (p, q)-junction j is in general decomposed into two pieces j1, j2 as depicted in figure

1. if j is a singlet with respect to the symmetry realized on the branes, then j1 = 0.

the charge z0 = (r, s) of the tadpole loop j2 is determined by charge conservation at the

trivalent vertex. when the tadpole loop goes around the an, dn and en branes of table

1, the loop charges (r, s), invariant charges qi and outgoing charges (p, q) are related as

follows:

an :

r,s = s(s1 +    + sn+1),

(p, q) = ((n + 1)s, 0),

dn :

r,s = s(s1 +    + sn)  (r  (n  1)s)sn+1  (r  (n  3)s)sn+2,

(p, q) = (2r + (n  4)s, 2s),

(3.13)

(3.14)

en :

r,s = s(s1 +    + sn1)  (r  (n  2)s)sn+1  (r  (n  4)s)(sn+1 + sn+2),

(p, q) = (3r + (2n  9)s, r + (n  6)s).

(3.15)

it should be remembered that if one employs a dierent 7-brane conguration from the

ones given in table 1 to describe the ade singularities, the assignment of the (r, s) charges

will also change.

the junctions form a lattice which is endowed with a symmetric intersection pairing

dened by [19]

(si, si) = 1,

(si, sj) = (sj, si) =

1

for i < j.

(3.16)

be isomorphic to the corresponding root lattice [19]. in these cases, the root junctions

represent the bps strings responsible for the symmetry enhancement.

for be9 the junction lattice forms an indenite lattice with signature (2+, 10). under

the condition that the total (p, q) charges (3.12) vanish, this lattice reduces to the semi-

denite one isomorphic to

z1  z2  (e8).

(3.17)

here 1 and 2 are the null junctions. a choice of basis is

1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1),

2 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 5, 3, 1).

(3.18)

the 1, 2 junctions are expressed as loops of (1, 0), (0, 1) strings, respectively, surround-

ing the be9 branes (3.10) counterclockwise, see figure 2. these null junctions represent
two imaginary roots of the loop algebra be9 [6] and will play a crucial role in our study of

torsions in section 4.

3.3 mordell-weil lattice from junctions

a rational elliptic surface s is a special kind of 9 points blown-up of p2 and b2 =
dim h2(s) = 10. h2(s) is a unimodular lorentzian lattice with signature (1+, 9). let

o and f be a class of zero section and generic ber. their intersections are o  o = 1,

o  f = 1 and f  f = 0. the orthogonal complement of ho, f i in h2(s) is isomorphic

to e8.

some elements of h2(s) appear as components of singular bers. they generate the

root lattice corresponding to the singularity type. let t  e8 be the lattice generated by

12

the components of singular bers. theorem 10.3 in [11] states that the structure of the

mordell-weil group of the rational elliptic surface s is described as

e(k)  l  (t /t ),

(3.19)

where l is the dual of l = t  (in e8) and t  = t  q  e8. from (3.19) the torsion
subgroup e(k)tor of e(k) is read o as e(k)tor  t /t , and hence e(k)/e(k)tor  l.

according to this theorem, the computation of e(k) is reduced to the embedding of lattice

t in e8.

in [12] all the possible structures of t and e(k) are classied. they are listed in

table 2 where r = rank e(k). in the last column for e(k), hki denotes a rank one

lattice z x with (x, x) = k and

to understand this result of [12] in terms of junctions, we have to solve the following

two problems:

(1) find the collapsible sub-congurations of 7-branes which support the singularity lattice

t as the junction lattice.

(2) compute the lattice l using string junctions on the 7-brane backgrounds.

the problem (1) is solved by nding a suitable rearrangement of the be9 congurations

(3.10) with the use of the brane move [21, 20]

 e(k) = a

1  h1/6i for no.32 and (z/2z)2 for no.70 in [12] should read e(k) = (23) and z/4z,

respectively.

thereby the total charges are kept invariant. moreover, what is important is that the

brane moves preserve the junction lattice. that is, under the unimodular transformation

(3.23) we can prove the relation

j = j2.

(3.25)

to this end, let us rewrite j2 as

 j2 =xi

qi qi,

qi = qi xk<i

(zk  zi)qk.

(3.26)

then, invariance of j2 follows from the transformation formulae for qj given by

i = qi+1,

(3.27)

now we nd brane congurations for every t as shown in table 2 where the branes

put in the parenthesis are the mutually coinciding ones corresponding to the singular

bers. we note that the an branes are used to represent the an singularity with n =

0, 1, 2, though one may use hn as well without changing the structure of e(k). all the

brane moves. this means that the lattice t in table 2 can be realized as a sub-lattice of

congurations in table 2 can be obtained from the be9 conguration (3.10) by suitable
the junction lattice on be9, hence t  e8.

example. (no.63)
the move from a8bcbc to a9x[2,1]x[1,2]c is given as follows:

a8bcbc = a8bc2x[3,1] = a7bx[0,1]c2x[3,1] = a7ba2x[0,1]x[3,1]

= a9x[3,1]x[0,1]x[3,1] = a8x[2,1]cx[4,1]a

= a8x[2,1]x[1,2]ca = a9x[2,1]x[1,2]c.

(3.28)

it is also possible to nd corresponding curves. some of them have already been given

in section 2, from which it is clear how to identify a curve with an entry of table 2. let

curves correspond to nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 15, 25, 44 and 45, respectively. the massless

us enumerate more examples based on [18, 1, 2]. the massive ben (n = 8, ..., 1) and bee1
ben (n = 8, ..., 3, 1) and bee0 curves correspond to nos. 62, 65, 69, 72, 67, 66, 70 and 63,

respectively. the seiberg-witten curves for n = 2 su(2) theory with various avor

symmetries [15] can be identied with no.64 (nf = 0), no.46 (nf = 1), nos. 26, 48, 71

(nf = 2), nos. 16, 30, 50, 52, 72 (nf = 3) and nos. 9, 18, 32, 34, 54, 57, 73 (nf = 4). in

each case, the number of independent mass parameters is given by r = rank e(k). for

the extremal cases r = 0, the curves and sections were explicitly obtained earlier in [22].

17

when we consider curves in view of table 2 there is a point to notice. as remarked

above, one can use either an or hn branes to describe the an singular bers with

n = 0, 1, 2. this does not change the structure of e(k), whereas it does change the

explicit form of corresponding elliptic curves, and hence we are led to dierent physical

interpretation. to clarify the point, let us examine the case of e(k) = e8, e

7, e

6 . the

7-branes are rewritten as

(a9n )an 1bcbc = (a9n )x[n6,1]an 1bc2

(3.29)

for n = 8, 7, 6. since the conguration (a9n )x[n6,1] is equivalent to (a9n )c up to
sl(2, z) conjugation, further coalescence can occur

(a9n )x[n6,1]  (a9n x[n6,1]) = hn1,

(3.30)

which also yields t = a8n . although the singularity structure of t is identical, it is

shown in [1] that the limit (3.30) gives rise to the compactication of 5d n = 1 en

theories down to 4d n = 2 en theories for n = 8, 7, 6. thus the structure of e(k)

seems not sensitive enough to distinguish these two theories.

in solving the problem (2), we recognize that the global structure of the surface s plays

a relevant role in determining the lattice l. this point is now illuminated by working out

several examples.

3.3.1 case of cartan type

let us rst consider the case no.7 using the brane conguration (a2)3a2bcbc. ac-

cordingly, we put si = ai (1  i  8), s9 = b1, s10 = c1, s11 = b2 and s12 = c2, where a, b

and c denote outgoing (1, 0)-, (1, 1)- and (1, 1)-strings attached to a, b and c branes,

respectively. (notice that the assignment of sj may be dierent from this for other cases

depending on the brane conguration.) choose the root junctions generating the lattice

t = a1

3 as

1 = s1  s2,

2 = s3  s4,

3 = s5  s6.

(3.31)

these junctions are supported by the collapsible branes a1a2, a3a4 and a5a6, re-

spectively, and there remain 6 branes a2bcbc of be9. from table 2 we see that the

18

corresponding mordell-weil lattice is e(k) = l = d
1. these lattices are canon-
ically realized on the 7-branes a4bc and a2. thus one needs apparently 8 branes,

4  a

which is more than the remaining ones. this puzzle, however, can be resolved if we con-

sider junctions containing strings which encircle the branes supporting t . to do so, we

note that the general form of junctions which are orthogonal to t with (p, q) = (0, 0) is

parameterized as

j = q1(s1 + s2) + q3(s3 + s4) + q5(s5 + s6)

(2q1 + 2q3 + 2q5 + q8 + 2q10 + 2q12)s7 + q8s8

+(q10  q11 + q12)s9 + q10s10 + q11s11 + q12s12.

(3.32)

thus these junctions span the 7-dimensional lattice. this junction lattice has elements

along the null junctions (3.18) and the remaining ones form a lattice of rank 5, which is

expected to be isomorphic to the lattice d4  a1. in fact one can nd the generators of

l = d4  a1 as

j1 = s7 + s8  s9  s10,

j2 = s9 + s11,

j3 = s5 + s6  s9  s10,

j4 = s3 + s4  s9  s10,

j5 = s7  s8,

(3.33)

where ji with 1  i  4 are for d4 and j5 is for a1. some of the strings in these

junctions are ending on the 7-branes which support the lattice t generated by (3.31). it

is observed, however, that they take the form of tadpole loops of (3.13) locally around each

of the collapsible branes a1a2, a3a4 and a5a6 (see figure 3), and hence the generators

(3.33) are in fact orthogonal to t . it should be noted that any junction orthogonal to the

lattice t in table 2 is of the form of (3.13)(3.15) locally around the coinciding an, dn

and en branes which describe the singular bers.

in a similar manner we construct the basis junctions of l for the other cases of cartan

type intersections. the results are presented in tables 37 where c(g) denotes the cartan

matrix of the lie algebra g and the self-intersection (times (1)) of the i-th junction is

given by the (i, i) element of the intersection matrix in the third column.

3.3.2 case of non-cartan type

in table 2 there exists a class of e(k) which are characterized by the intersection matrices

of non-cartan type (3.20). it is intriguing that we can indeed derive these intersection

matrices from the junctions. some examples are given as follows:

example. (no.12)
we have the 7-branes (a3)(a2)2abcbc. the junctions orthogonal to t = a2  a2
1
are

j1 = s4 + s5 + 2s8 + s10  2s11  3s12,

j2 = s6 + s7  s11  s12,

j3 = s10  s12,

j4 = s4 + s5  s11  s12.

these consist of the basis junctions of l. the intersection matrix turns out to be

 (ji, jj) =

further computations enable us to write down the basis junctions and their inter-

sections for all the cases of non-cartan type (3.20). the results are shown in tables

47.

finally, for the case of rank e(k) = 1 (nos. 4361), the lattice l is one dimensional

and we have determined its generator. the result is presented in table 7. thus, we have

completed the construction of the lattice l listed in table 2 in terms of string junctions,

producing the classication tables 37.

4 weight lattice and torsions

4.1 weak integrality of invariant charges

the mordell-weil group e(k) consists of the free part e(k)/e(k)tor and the torsion

part e(k)tor. according to theorem 9.2 in [11] the former should be isomorphic to the
weight lattice l of l = t  in e8.

we rst would like to discuss the property of l in view of junctions. naively, the

weight junctions i can be obtained as the dual to the basis junctions ji, i.e. i =
(c 1)ijjj, where c is the intersection matrix. though the invariant charges qi of these

dual basis junctions i are in general not integer, we can remedy this partially by adding

null junctions.

(4.3)

these examples show that some of the charges qi still remain fractional. however, the

fractionality is restricted by certain condition which we call weak integrality. in general, a

junction orthogonal to the lattice t can be represented by using tadpole junctions (j2 in

figure 1) that go around the collapsed branes and do not touch them directly. accordingly,

for each of the collapsed branes, say (x[pi,qi]    x[pj,qj]), we require the integrality not for
individual charges qk (i  k  j), but for their total (p, q) charges. namely

(p, q) = qi(pi, qi) +    + qj(pj, qj)  z2.

(4.4)

we call this condition weak integrality.

we now wish to point out that the junctions orthogonal to t subject to this weak

integrality condition form the full mordell-weil lattice e(k) rather than the lattice l

(called the narrow mordell-weil lattice in [11, 12]). to see this, we have rst checked that

the torsion free part of e(k) is the dual lattice l of l by explicitly constructing the

dual basis in terms of string junctions. the dual basis junctions have been worked out

for all the cases nos. 161. they indeed satisfy the weak integrality condition.

4.2 torsions as fractional null junctions

let us next consider the torsion part e(k)tor. by denition, a section p  e(k) is

a torsion if and only if mp = o for some m  z>0. then its height pairing vanishes

(p, q) = 0 for any q  e(k) since m(p, q) = (o, q) = 0. hence p corresponds to a

null junction. we know there are two independent null junctions 1, 2. by virtue of the

hanany-witten eect, these null junctions can be transformed to the canonical form with

integer charges qi, see (3.18) for instance. we call such null junctions strongly integral

ones. as we remarked above, a fractional junction which is integral only in weak sense

is also allowed for e(k). it is then shown that the weakly integral null junctions, which

we refer to as fractional loop junctions, are identied as the torsions (modulo strongly

integral null junctions). our idea is explained by presenting some examples explicitly.

example. (no.73)
the brane conguration consists of two collapsed branes (a4bc)(a4bc). each of them

supports one of the d4 components in t = d4  d4. the junctions orthogonal to t

become null junctions of the form

j = q1(s1 + s2 + s3 + s4)  (2q1 + q12)s5  q12s6

q1(s7 + s8 + s9 + s10) + (2q1 + q12)s11 + q12s12.

(4.5)

thus the (p, q) charges exchanged between the two d4 components are p = 2(q1  q12)

and q = 2(q1 + q12). the integrality condition on (p, q) requires 2q1  2q12  0. hence
we obtain the (z/2z)2 torsion. the generators of the torsion junctions are

the result for the torsion group we have obtained from the junction consideration is in

agreement with that in [12].

5 discussion

in this paper, we have systematically studied the structure of singularities, mordell-weil

lattices and torsions of a rational elliptic surface by making use of the 7-brane-junction

technology. our results are in nice agreement with oguiso-shiodas main theorem in [12].

consequently we found explicit correspondence between sections and junctions, which is

summarized in table 8.

though we have restricted ourselves to the case of rational elliptic surfaces, gener-

alization to other elliptic surfaces is clear and stated as follows: for a general elliptic

surface p : s  c over a curve c, the lattice of strongly integral tadpole junctions can
be identied with the cohomology group h 1(c, r1pz) whose h 1,1 part is isomorphic to

the narrow mordell-weil group of s. (for a rational elliptic surface, all the elements in
h 1(c, r1pz) belong to its h 1,1 part, however, it is not so in general.) since the sheaf
r1pz is a local system whose ber at x  c is h 1(p1(x), z) = z  z, the coho-
mology h 1(c, r1pz) can be evaluated by using group cohomology associated with the

monodromy representation  : 1(c  {singularity})  sl(2, z). the 7-brane-junction
technology may oer an ecient way to calculate this cohomology h 1(c, r1pz) and

intersections on it.

one may apply our results to gain a physical understanding of torsion groups which

play an important role to determine the gauge group rather than the gauge algebra [10].

since the structure of mordell-weil lattices is related to the wilson lines on the heterotic

side under f-theory/heterotic duality, it will be interesting to think of the issue from the

heterotic string point of view.

another application is found when we consider stable non-bps states in f-theory. it

has recently been recognized that, in string theory, there exist solitonic states which are

stable but not bps [24]. these states are the lightest ones which carry certain conserved

 we thank m. saito for pointing out this interpretation. see [23].

charges, i.e. there exist no other bps or non-bps states of lower mass having the same

charges. thus their stability is ensured by charge conservation.

in [2] the analysis of

stable non-bps states in f-theory on k3 was initiated. as we will see now, the structure

of the mordell-weil lattice determines the 7-brane congurations supporting non-bps

junctions which could be candidates for stable non-bps states in a region of the moduli

space of f-theory on k3.

let us consider the region of the moduli space where 24 7-branes for an elliptic k3

are split into two be9 [6]. this corresponds to the so-called stable degeneration of k3
[7, 8]. two be9 brane congurations are properly isolated from each other in the sense of
[2]. thus we may focus on string junctions stretched on a single be9 to analyze non-bps

states. the bps junctions jbp s have to obey the holomorphy condition which is stated
bp s  2 [25, 26]. thus junctions j with j2 < 2 are non-bps. inspecting table 7
as j2
we rst observe that the basis junctions of one-dimensional l, except for the case l = a1,

are all non-bps. as for the higher rank e(k), we also have non-bps basis junctions in

nos. 12, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 2933, 3638, 40 and 41. we note that the cases no.45 (bee1),
no.46 (d1) and no.25 (ee2) have already appeared in [2]. each non-bps basis junction,

which we denote as ju(1), generates the u(1) symmetry associated to the one-dimensional

lattice. it is clear that any junction can be written as

j = j + n ju(1),

(5.1)

where n  z and j stands for the orthogonal components of j with respect to the u(1)
direction. then the self-intersection is obtained as j2 = j2 + n2 j2
u(1). since j2  0 and

31

j2
u(1) < 2 we have j2 < 2 for any n 6= 0. therefore the junctions with non-vanishing
component along ju(1) represent non-bps states. among these non-bps states there

could be stable states against decay. identifying such stable states requires the detailed

dynamical analysis which is beyond the scope of this paper.
