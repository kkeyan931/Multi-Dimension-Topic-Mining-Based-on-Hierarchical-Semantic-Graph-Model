abstract

a superspace formulation is proposed for the osp(1, 2)covariant lagrangian quanti-
zation of general massive gauge theories. the superalgebra osp(1, 2) is considered as
subalgebra of the superalgebra sl(1, 2)  osp(2, 2) which may be considered as the
algebra of generators of the conformal group in a superspace with two anticommut-
ing coordinates. the massdependent (anti)brst symmetries of proper solutions
of the quantum master equations in the osp(1,2)covariant formalism are realized
in that superspace as invariance under translations combined with massdependent
special conformal transformations. the sp(2) symmetry  in particular the ghost
number conservation  and the new ghost number conservation are realized in the
superspace as invariance under symplectic rotations and dilatations, respectively.
the new ghost number conservation is generally broken by the choice of a gauge.
the transformations of the gauge elds and the full set of necessarily required
(anti)ghost and auxiliary elds under the superalgebra sl(1, 2) are determined both
for irreducible and rststage reducible theories with closed gauge algebra.

1 introduction

after the realization that the eective lagrangian of nonabelian gauge theories is in-

variant with respect to becchi-rouet-storatyutin (brst) [1] as well as antibrst

transformations [2], it has been recognized that this invariance can be used as a funda-

mental principle in the construction of covariantly quantized gauge theories (for a modern

introduction see [3]). in particular, a supereld formulation of quantized pure yangmills

theories by bonora and tonin provides a convenient framework for describing the ex-

tended brst symmetries [4].

in this framework the extended brst symmetries are

realized as translations in a superspace along additional anticommuting coordinates (for

a more recent approach, we refer to [5] and references therein).

a sp(2)covariant supereld description of lagrangian quantization of general gauge

theories, which is applicable irrespective of whether the theories are irreducible or re-

ducible and whether the gauge algebra is closed or open, has been given in ref.

[6]. a

corresponding supereld formulation of the quantization procedure in the hamiltonian

approach for theories with rstclass constraints has been given in ref. [7].

recently, the sp(2)quantization of batalin, lavrov and tyutin(blt) has been ex-

tended to a formalism which is based on the orthosymplectic superalgebra osp(1, 2) [8]

and which can be applied to massive gauge theories. this is achieved by incorporating

into the extended brst transformations mdependent terms in such a way that the m

extended (anti)brst symmetry of the quantum action wm is preserved. in that approach

wm is required to satisfy the generalized quantum master equations of mextended brst

symmetry and, in addition, of sp(2) symmetry,

1

mwm = ihawm  a exp{wm} = 0,
2(wm, wm)a + v a
2 {wm, wm} + vwm = ihwm   exp{wm} = 0,

respectively, whose generating (second order) dierential operators

a

m  a + (i/h)v a
m,
   + (i/h)v,

(a = 1, 2),

( = 0, 1),

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

(1.4)

form a superalgebra isomorphic to osp(1, 2) (the denitions of the (anti)brackets and the
operators a

m and  are given below).

the incorporation of mass terms into the action wm is necessary at least intermedi-

ately in the renormalization scheme of bogoliubov, parasiuk, hepp, zimmermann and

lowenstein(bphzl)[9]. an essential ingredient to deal with massless theories in that

2

scheme consists in the introduction of a regularizing mass m = (s  1)m for any massless

eld and performing ultraviolet as well as infrared subtractions thereby avoiding spuri-

ous infrared singularities in the limit s  1. by using such an infrared regularization 

without violating the extended brst symmetries  the osp(1, 2)superalgebra appears

necessarily.

moreover, the bphzl renormalization scheme is probably the mathematical best

founded one in order to formulate the quantum master equations on the level of algebraic

renormalization theory and to properly compute higherloop anomalies [10]. the reason

is the following: the only quantity that remains undened in the above mentioned ap-

proaches of quantizing general gauge theories is the righthand side of the quantum master

equations (that problem already occurs in the batalinvilkovisky(bv) eldantield for-

malism). at the classical level, the extended brst invariance in the osp(1, 2)approach
is expressed by the classical master equations 1

msm = 0, where sm is the
lowest order approximation in h of wm. on the quantum level, formal manipulations

2(sm, sm)a + v a

modify the classical master equations into eq. (1.1). when applied to the local functional

wm the operation awm leads to the illdened expression (0). welldened expres-
sions for the regularized operators a are proposed at oneloop level in [11] within the

context of pauli-villars regularization and at higher order in [12] for nonlocal regular-

ization. however, by means of the bphzl renormalization scheme, which bypasses any

ultraviolet regularizations, the righthand side of the quantum master equations can be

dened by using zimmermannss normal products to any order of perturbation theory

[10].

the purpose of the present paper is to reveal the geometrical content of the osp(1, 2)

covariant lagrangian quantization which amounts to understand the geometrical meaning

of the mdependent part of the extended brst transformations. for that reason the

theory will be described in terms of super(anti)elds. our approach is based on the idea

to consider osp(1, 2) as subsuperalgebra of the superalgebra sl(1, 2). the latter algebra,

being isomorphic to osp(2, 2), contains four bosonic generators v and v , which form the
lie algebra sl(2)  u(1), and four (nilpotent) fermionic generators v a

. the even
part of osp(1, 2) is the algebra sl(2) generating the special linear transformations, but due

+ and v a

to their isomorphism to the algebra sp(2) we will speak about symplectic transformations.

the eigenvalues of the generators v for  = 0 dene the ghost numbers, whereas the

eigenvalues of the generator v dene what in ref. [13] was called the new ghost number.

the generators v a

) = 1, respectively.

+ and v a

 have opposite new ghost numbers, ngh(v a

3

but, introducing a mass m which formally will be attributed also by a new ghost number,

ngh(m) = 1, they can be combined into two fermionic generators v a

the superalgebra osp(1, 2). for m 6= 0 these generators v a

m = v a

 of
m are neither nilpotent nor do

2 m2v a

+ + 1

they anticommutate among themselves.

the key observation that allows for a geometric interpretation of the superalgebra

sl(1, 2) is due to baulieu, siegel and zwiebach [14] which in a quite dierent context of

mations in a 2dimensional superspace. hence, the generators v a

string theory gave a description of sl(1, 2) as the algebra generating conformal transfor-
, v ab = ()abv
and v of the superalgebra sl(1, 2), with ()ab generating the fundamental representation

+, v a

of sl(2), may be considered as generators of translations ip a, special conformal transfor-

mations ik a, symplectic rotations im ab and dilatations id, respectively, in superspace.

this leads immediatly to a natural geometric formulation of the osp(1, 2) quantiza-

tion procedure:

in a superspace description the invariance of wm under mextended

brst transformations, generated by v a

, corresponds to translations
combined with mdependent special conformal transformations, and its invariance un-

m = v a

2 m2v a

+ + 1

der sp(2)transformations, generated by v, corresponds to symplectic rotations. fur-
thermore, solutions sm of the classical master equations 1

msm = 0 and
{sm, sm} + vsm = 0 with vanishing new ghost number, ngh(sm) = 0, correspond to

2(sm, sm)a + v a

solutions in the superspace being invariant under dilatations, generated by v .

the paper is organized as follows. in sect. 2 we shortly review some basic denitions

and properties of lstage reducible gauge theories and we introduce the corresponding

conguration space of elds and antields. furthermore, the (anti)commutation relations

of the superalgebra sl(1, 2) are dened and an explicit realization in terms of linear dif-

ferential operators acting on the antields are given. in sect. 3 the superalgebra sl(1, 2)

is realized as algebra of the conformal group in superspace where the usual spacetime

is extended by two extra anticommuting coordinates a. moreover, we give a superspace

representation of the algebra sl(1, 2) acting linearly on the super(anti)elds. in sect. 4

the osp(1, 2)covariant supereld quantization rules for general gauge theories are formu-

lated. besides, it is shown that proper solutions of the classical master equations can be

constructed being invariant under osp(1, 2)  u(1), where the additional u(1) symmetry is

related to the new ghost number conservation; however, this symmetry is broken by choos-

ing a gauge. sect. 5 is devoted to study the (in)dependence of general greens functions

on the choice of the gauge. in the osp(1, 2) approach it is proven that mass terms gener-

ally destroy gauge independence; however, this gauge dependence disappears in the limit

4

m = 0. in sect. 6 we construct osp(1, 2)  u(1) symmetric proper solutions of the classical

master equations. moreover, the problem of how to determine the transformations of the

gauge elds and the full set of the necessary (anti)ghost and auxiliary elds under the

superalgebra sl(1, 2) is solved both for irreducible and rststage reducible theories with

closed algebra.

throughout this paper we have used the condensed notation introduced by dewitt [15]

and conventions adopted in ref. [8]; if not specied otherwise, derivatives with respect to
the superantields a() and the superspace coordinates a are the (usual) left ones and
that with respect to the superelds a() are right ones. left derivatives with respect

to a() and right derivatives with respect to a are labelled by the subscript l and

r, respectively; for example, l/a() (r/a) denotes the left(right) derivative with
respect to the superelds a() (the superspace coordinates a).

2 realization of sl(1, 2) in terms of antields

(a) general gauge theories

before going into the main subject of this section let us shortly introduce the basic de-

nitions of general gauge theories and the corresponding conguration space of elds and

antields:

a set of gauge (as well as matter) elds ai with grassmann parities (ai) = i will be

considered whose classical action scl(a) is invariant under the gauge transformations

ai = ri

00,

0 = 1, . . . , n0,

scl,iri

0 = 0;

(2.1)

here, 0 are the parameters of these transformations and ri
having grassmann parity (0) = 0 and (ri
x,j = x/aj.

0(a) are the gauge generators
0) = i + 0, respectively; by denition

for general gauge theories the algebra of generators has the form [13]:

ri

0,jrj

0  (1)0 0 ri

0,jrj

0 = ri

0f 0

00  m ij

00scl,j,

(2.2)

where f 0

00(a) are the elddependent structure functions and the matrix m ij

00(a) is
graded antisymmetric with respect to (ij) and (00). the gauge algebra is said to be
closed if m ij
00 = 0, otherwise it is called open. moreover, eq. (2.2) denes a lie algebra
if the algebra is closed and the f 0

00 do not depend on ai.

if the set of generators ri

[16]. on the other hand, if the generators ri

0 are linearly independent then the theory is called irreducible
0 are not independent, i.e., if onshell certain

5

relations exist among them, then, according to the following characterization, the theory

under consideration is called lstage reducible [17]:
there exists a chain of elddependent onshell zeromodes z s1

s

(a),

ri

0z 0
s1 z s1

z s2

1 = scl,jk ji
1,

s = scl,jk js2

s

k ij

1 = (1)ij k ji
1,

,

s = 1, . . . , ns, s = 2, . . . , l,

where the stage l of reducibility is dened by the lowest value s for which the matrix
z l1
(z s1

s1 with
) = s1 + s. in the following, if not stated otherwise, we assume s to take on

(a) is no longer degenerated. the z s1

are the onshell zero modes for z s2

l

s

s

the values s = 0, . . . , l, thereby including also the case of irreducible theories.

the whole space of elds a and antields a, 

aa, a together with their grassmann

parities (modulo 2) is characterized by the following sets [13, 8]

a = (ai, bs|a1as, c s|a0as, s = 0, . . . l),
a = ( ai, bs|a1as, cs|a0as, s = 0, . . . l),

aa = (a

sa|a1as, c 

sa|a0as, s = 0, . . . l),

ia, b

(a)  a = (i, s + s, s + s + 1)
( a) = a,

(

aa) = a + 1,

a = (di, es|a1as, fs|a0as, s = 0, . . . l),

(a) = a,

respectively. here, the pyramids of auxiliary elds bs|a1as and (anti)ghosts c s|a0as

are sp(2)tensors of rank s and s + 1, respectively, being completely symmetric with re-

spect to the internal sp(2)indices ai = 1, 2, (i = 0, 1, . . . , s); similarly for the antields
a, 
aa and sources a. the independent index a = 1, 2 which counts the two compo-
nents of a sp(2)spinor will be called external. the totally symmetrized sp(2)tensors

are irreducible and have maximal sp(2)spin. raising and lowering of sp(2)indices is

obtained by the invariant tensor

ab = (cid:18) 0

1 0(cid:19) ,

accb = a
b .

(b) the superalgebra sl(1,2)

the main goal of this section is to determine the action of the generators of the superal-
gebra sl(1, 2) on the antields a, 

aa and a. let us now introduce that algebra.

the even part of sl(1, 2)  sl(2, 1) is the lie algebra sl(2)  u(1). we denote by

v, ( = 0, ) the (real) generators of sl(2) and by v the generator of u(1). the
odd part of sl(1, 2) contains two (nilpotent) sl(2)spinors, v a
2 and weyl
 are dened through their

) = 1, respectively. spin and weyl weight of v a

, with spin 1

weight (v a

6

behaviour under the action of the generators v and v , respectively. 2

the (anti)commutation relations of the superalgebra sl(1, 2) are [18]:

[v, v] = 0,

[v, v] = 



 v,

[v, v a

[v, v a

+] = v a

+() a
+] = v b

{v a

{v a

[v, v a

[v, v a

] = v a
,
] = v b
} = ()abv  abv,

() a
b ,

{v a

(2.3)

where the sp(2)indices are raised or lowered according to

()ab = ac() b

c = ()a

() b

a = ()b

a,

ccb = ac()cddb,
()ab = ()ba.

the matrices ( = 0, ) generate the (real) lie algebra sl(2) being isomorphic to sp(2):

() c

a () b

2() b
a ,

() b

a = g() b
a ,

(2.4)

c = gb
g = 


a + 1
1 0 0
0 0 2
0 2 0


 ,

gg = 
 ,

where  is the totally antisymmetric tensor, 0+ = 1. for the generators  we may
choose the representation (0) b
2 (1  i2), with  ( = 1, 2, 3)

a = 3 and () b

a =  1

being the pauli matrices.

let us now rewrite the sl(1, 2)algebra in two equivalent forms, both of which being

of physical relevance in the following. first, introducing another basis v ab of the sl(2)

generators, namely

v ab = ()abv,

(2.5)

and making use of the equalities

()ab() c

d = c{ab}
d ,



 ()ab()cd = {c{a()b}d},


where the curly brackets { } indicate symmetrization of indices, the (anti)commutation

relations of sl(1, 2) read

[v, v ab] = 0,

[v ab, v cd] = {c{av b}d},

{v a

+, v b

+} = 0,

[v, v a

+] = v a
+,
+] = c{av b}
+ ,

[v ab, v c

{v a

, v b

} = 0,

[v, v a

] = v a
,
] = c{av b}
 ,
} = v ab  abv.

[v ab, v c

{v a

+, v b

(2.6)

2 identifying v  id with d being the generator of dilatations in superspace, as will be done in
sect. 3, the weyl weight coincides with the superspace scale dimension of the corresponding quantity. of
course, the latter should not be confuced with the scale dimension of any quantity in ordinary spacetime.

7

in that form the superalgebra sl(1, 2) may be given a geometric interpretation as the

algebra of the conformal group in a 2dimensional superspace having two anticommuting

coordinates (see sect. 3 below).

secondly, we remark that within the eldantield formalism not the entire sl(1, 2)

superalgebra will be of physical relevance, since not any of their generators dene sym-

metry operations of the quantum action  only some combinations of them forming a

orthosymplectic superalgebra osp(1, 2) generate symmetries (see sect. 4 below). there-

fore, with respect to this let us notice the isomorphism between sl(1, 2) and osp(2, 2) by

introducing the following two combinations of v a

+ and v a
,

oa

+  v a

+ + 1

2 v a
,

oa

  v a

+  1

2v a
.

then for the (anti)commutation relations of the superalgebra osp(2, 2) we obtain

[v, v] = 0,

[v, v] =

[v, oa

+) as well as (v, oa

here, (v, oa
as well as (v, oa

) obey two dierent osp(1, 2)superalgebras with (v, oa
)
+) forming an irreducible tensor of these algebras, respectively, either of
+ and oa


them transforming according to the same representation. notice, that both oa

are neither nilpotent nor do they anticommute among themselves.

(c) representation of sl(1,2) on the antields

now, let us give an explicit linear realization of the generators of the superalgebra (2.3)
by their action on the antields a, 
the elds a will be given in sect. 4).

(for a componentwise notation see appendix a). in eqs. (2.7), (2.8) we introduced two

a are arbitrary diagonal matrices whose entries ( a), in
general, may be any (real) numbers. by denition, cf. eq. (2.8), ( a) is the (up to
now arbitrary) weyl weight of the antields . (this arbitrariness may be traced back to

fact that these representations of sl(1, 2) are not completely reducible, cf. [18]). taking
advantage of that freedom we may x ( a) by relating it to the weyl weight (a) of
the elds a  which is uniquely determined by means of the quantum master equations

at the lowest order of h (see sect. 4 and 6 below)  according to

3 the requirement (2.10) ensures that (proper) solutions sm of the mextended classical master
equations can be constructed having vanishing weyl weight, (sm) = 0. later on, we identify the weyl
weight of the (anti)elds with the new ghost number introduced in ref. [13].

9

from their entries one may read o the weyl weight (a) of the elds a, namely

(a) = (0, s + 2, s + 1),

(2.12)

and, throught eq. (2.10), the weyl weights of the antields a, 

aa and a,

( a) = (a)  2,

(

aa) = (a)  1,

(a) = (a).

(2.13)

in order to prove that the transformations (2.7) and (2.8) obey the sl(1, 2)superalgebra

one needs the basic properties (2.4) of the matrices  and the following two equalities:

3 superspace representations of the algebra sl(1, 2)

this section is devoted to a geometric interpretation of the superalgebra sl(1, 2) as given

by eqs. (2.6). this opens the possibility to formulate the quantization of general gauge

theories in terms of super(anti)elds over a 2dimensional superspace.

(a) representations of sl(1,2) in superspace

in ref.

[14] it was pointed out that the generators of the (real) algebra osp(1, 1|2) 

sl(1, 2) acquire a clear geometric meaning if they are interpreted as generators of trans-

formations in superspace. this is obtained by redening the generators of sl(1, 2) as

follows:

v a
+  ip a,

v a
  ik a,

v ab  im ab,

v  id.

(3.1)

then, the (anti)commutation relations resulting from (2.6) can be interpreted as algebra

of the conformal group in two anticommuting dimensions with metric tensor ab:

[d, m ab] = 0,

[d, p a] = ip a,

[d, k a] = ik a,

[m ab, m cd] = i{c{am b}d},

[m ab, p c] = ic{ap b},

[m ab, k c] = ic{ak b},

(3.2)

{p a, p b} = 0,

{k a, k b} = 0,

{p a, k b} = i(abd  m ab),

with p a, k a, m ab and d being the generators of translations, special conformal transfor-

mations, (symplectic) rotations and dilatations, respectively. the superspace which we

10

encounter here is obtained by extending the usual spacetime to include two extra anti-

commuting coordinates a. raising and lowering of sp(2)indices are dened by the rules

a = abb and a = abb; the square of a and the derivative with respect to it are dened
by 2  1

2abba and 2/2  1

2ab2/ba.

the representation of the algebra (3.2) in that superspace is given by

p a = i


a

,

k a = 2i2 
a
m ab = i(cid:16)a 

b

 b(ab  iab),
+ b 

a(cid:17) + ab,

d = ia

 i,


a

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

where ab and  constitute the basis of some nitedimensional representation of the

algebra of the little group, i.e., the stabilizer subgroup of that conformal group,

obviously, the corresponding representation of the algebra (2.6) is obtained by a change

of the sl(2)generators analogous to (2.5), ab = i()ab, with  being related to

(3.10)

(3.11)

now, having revealed the geometrical content of the generators of sl(1, 2) we are able to

formulate the transformations (2.7) and (2.8) in superspace. let a(), (a())  a,
be a set of superelds with the restriction a()|=0 = a. it admits the following general

expansion in terms of component elds,

a() = a + aaa  a2,



a()

=


a 2  a


aa 



a

(3.12)

(remember that, according to the general convention, derivatives with respect to the elds
are dened as acting from the right). with each supereld a() a superantield a()
is associated having the same grassmann parity, ( a()) = a,

a() = a  a

=

 b()
 a()

= a

b2(  ),

with

2(  )  (  )2.

then, by the help of a() the sl(1, 2)-transformations (2.7) and (2.8) may be written in
the following compact form:

(3.18)

some care has to be taken in order to get the correct signs in these equations. first,

in order to attain that the transformations laws (3.14)(3.17) are compatible with the

superalgebra (2.6) it is necessary to take into account an extra minus sign on the right

hand side of (3.16) and (3.17) (cf. eqs. (3.10), (3.11)). since the matrices  generate

an irreducible representation of the symplectic group, by virtue of (3.7),  must be a

number which, by denition, agrees with the weyl weight of the superantields (observe

() = 1 in accordance with eqs. (2.13)). secondly, let us emphasize that the minus sign

on the righthand side of the rst relation (3.18) is crucial: a further transformation in
(3.16) does not act on the numerical matrices  but directly on a(); this reverses the
factors on the righthand side against those on the left one and the minus sign is therefore

necessary to retain the multiplication law of the conformal group.

furthermore, let us give also a superspace representation of sl(1, 2) in terms of a().

(3.28) and (3.29) indeed satisfy the sl(1, 2)superalgebra (3.23).

4 quantum master equations

the superspace representation of sl(1, 2) obtained in the previous section enables one

to attack the problem of supereld quantization of general gauge theories. a supereld

in
version for the sp(2)covariant lagrangian quantization was proposed in ref.
that approach the quantum action w (a(), a()) is required to be invariant under the
(anti)brst transformations which, in superspace, are realized as translations along the

[6].

coordinates a.

in order to proceed further in the development of that formalism one may attempt to

include also special conformal transformations, symplectic rotations and dilatations by im-

posing additional symmetry requirements. such an extension is possible, but only for one

of the two osp(1, 2)subalgebras of osp(2, 2)  sl(1, 2). indeed, for a supereld description

of the osp(1, 2)covariant quantization procedure introduced in ref.

[8] one needs both

translations as well as special conformal transformations and symplectic rotations.

in

that approach the translations are combined with the special conformal transformations

by means of a mass parameter m leading to mdependent (anti)brst transformations.

the invariance under symplectic transformations ensures the ghost number conservation
of the corresponding quantum action wm(a(), a()). in addition, the dilatations may

14

be used to ensure the new ghost number conservation of wm(a(), a()) at the lowest
order of h.

(a) sp(2)covariant supereld quantization

to begin with, we shortly review the sp(2)covariant supereld quantization [6]. let us

introduce the antisymplectic dierential operators

a = a + (i/h)v a,

v a  v a
+,

(4.1)

with the translations v a

+ given by eq. (3.19) and the nilpotent (secondorder) dierential

operators a given by

a = z d2

2l

2a()

a



 a()

= (1)a l
a




aa

.

(4.2)

let us remark, that this denition of a by projecting out from l/a() only the rst

component agrees with the initial denition in ref. [13] but diers from that in ref. [6]. in

our opinion the denition (4.2) seems to be much better adapted to the present aim than

that of ref. [6] since a change of the denition of a, like in the triplectic quantization

[19], requires also a change of the denition of v a  but then the geometric meaning of
v a would be lost. the operators a, a and v a possess the important properties of

nilpotency and (relative) anticommutativity,

{ a, b} = 0  {a, b} = 0,

{v a, v b} = 0,

{a, v b} = 0.

the basic object of the supereld quantization is the quantum action w (a(), a()),

which is required to be a solution of the quantum master equation

a exp{(i/h)w } = 0



1

2(w, w )a + v aw = ihaw,

(4.3)

where the superantibrackets (f, g)a are dened by

(f, g)a = (1)az d2n 2f

2a()

a

g

 a()

 (1)((f )+1)((g)+1)(f  g)o.

(4.4)

the solution of (4.3) is sought of as a power series in plancks constant h,

w = s +



xn=1

hnwn.

furthermore, two requirements  the nondegeneracy of s and the correctness of the clas-

sical limit  have to be imposed. the rst one is translated into the requirement that s

should be a proper solution of the classical master equation, i.e., the hessian of second

15

derivatives of s should be of maximal rank at the stationary points, and the second one

means that s should satisfy the usual boundary condition, namely that s coincides with

the classical action scl(a) if all the antields are put equal to zero.

to remove the gauge degeneracy of the action s, one introduces the operator

u (f ) = exp{(h/i) t (f )} with

t (f ) = 1

2ab{ b, [ a, f ]},

f = f (a()) being an arbitrary bosonic gauge xing functional. then, the gauge xed
quantum action wext(a(), a()), dened by

exp{(i/h)wext} = u(f ) exp{(i/h)w },

(4.5)

is also a solution of the quantum master equations (4.3).

(b) osp(1,2)covariant supereld quantization

let us now give the supereld description of the osp(1, 2)covariant quantization [8]. in

that approach the antisymplectic dierential operators (4.1) are replaced by

a

m = a + (i/h)v a
m,

v a
m  v a

+ + 1

as long as m 6= 0 the operators a

among themselves; instead, together with the operators  they generate a superalgebra
isomorphic to osp(1, 2):

[v, v] =

exp{(i/h)wm,ext} = um(f ) exp{(i/h)wm},

(4.12)

where the operator um(f ) has to be choosen as [8]

um(f ) = exp{(h/i) tm(f )} with

tm(f ) = 1

2ab{ b

m, [ a

m, f ]} + (i/h)2m2f,

f = f (a()) being the gauge xing functional. with these denitions one establishes

the following two relations:

[ a

m, tm(f )] = 1

[ , tm(f )] = 1

restricting f (a()) to be a sp(2)scalar by imposing the condition [ , f ]wm = 0
m, um(f )] and [ , um(f )], if
it can be veried (see ref. [8]) that the commutators [ a
applied on exp{(i/h)wm}, vanish on the subspace of admissible actions wm. these action

are determined by the condition

z d2 2n wm

 a()

+ a()o = 0



wm
a

= a,

(4.13)

i.e., depending only linearly on a. this condition ensures that the gauge xed quantum

action wm,ext also satises the quantum master equations (4.9) and (4.10). then, by
virtue of (4.13), the restriction [ , f ]wm = 0 becomes

[ , f ]wm = 0

b + vwm = 0,

(4.14)

since the matrices are traceless.

the equations (4.14) for  = 0 express the ghost number conservation of the action

s

s

gh(a) = (cid:16)0,
xr=1
gh( a) = gh(a),

(1)ar ,

(1)ar(cid:17),
xr=0
aa) = gh(a) + (1)a,

where

gh(

ar = 1, 2,

gh(a) = gh(a).

(c) new ghost number conservation

in ref. [13] also a socalled new ghost number was ascribed to all elds and antields of

the solutions of the classical master equations in the following way:

ngh( a) = ngh(a)  2,

ngh(

aa) = ngh(a)  1,

ngh(a) = ngh(a).

ngh(a) = (0, s + 2, s + 1),

according to these denitions we also have ngh(a) = 1. in comparison with eqs. (2.12)

and (2.13) it follows that the new ghost number agrees with the weyl weight of the elds

and antields, i.e.,

ngh(a) = (a),
ngh( a) = ( a),

ngh(aa) = (aa),

ngh(a) = (a),

ngh(

aa) = (

aa),

ngh(a) = (a).

in order to clarify how in our approach both numbers are related to each other let us

introduce the following dierential operator

m =  + (i/h)vm,

vm  v + m


m

,

(4.15)

with the dilatations v given by eq. (3.22) and the (secondorder) dierential operator

 dened by

 = (1)a+1z d2 2a

m and  form an exten-
the new operator m together with the generating operators a
sion of the osp(1, 2)superalgebra being isomorphic to osp(1, 2)  u(1) where, in addition

18

to the (anti)commutation relations (4.8), the following relations hold true:

[vm, vm] = 0,

[vm, v] = 0,

[vm, v a

m] = v a
m,

[ m, m] = 0,
[ m, ] = 0,
[ m, a

m] = (i/h) a
m.

(4.16)

let us assume now that solutions wm of the quantum master equations (4.10) and

(4.11) can be constructed which also satisfy the following equation:

m exp{(i/h)wm} = 0



1
2{wm, wm} + vmwm = ihmwm

b = a

(4.18)

with the following abbreviation

{f, g} = z d2n2

2f

g

2a()

 b()

notice, that {f, g} does not dene a new superbracket since a

b(a) is a
diagonal matrix. taking into account the restriction (4.13) the additional master equation

(4.17), at the lowest order of h, simplies according to

z d2 2 2sm

2a()

b()a

b + vmsm = 0.

(4.19)

obviously, the matrix b

(4.9) and (4.10) at the lowest order of h, together with eq. (4.19). the matrix b

a is uniquely determined by solving the quantum master equations
a , which
enters in vm, is xed by the requirement (2.10). equation (4.19) expresses the conservation

of the new ghost number of sm in the case m 6= 0, i.e., ngh(sm) = 0. thereby, we have

formally ascribed also a new ghost number resp. weyl weight to the mass parameter m,

namely, according to the denition of vm, ngh(m) = 1 resp. (m) = 1. this already has
been used in the denition of v a

m, eq. (4.6).

let us emphasize that the equation (4.17) is quite formal since its righthand side, for

the same reasons as explained in the introduction, is not well dened. since, generally,

the new ghost number is conserved only in the classical limit, we restricted ourselves

in (4.19) to the lowest order approximation. in order to express the new ghost number

conservation to higher orders  which is, of course, only possible as long as the dilatation

invariance in superspace is not broken by radiative corrections  this requires a sensitive

denition of the expression mwm on the righthand side of eq. (4.17).

in order to

obtain a corresponding local quantum operator equation, which is valid to all orders in

perturbation theory, one can use the method described in ref. [10].

19

independently, by introducing a gauge the gaugexed quantum action (4.12) breaks

the new ghost number conservation. namely, because of

[m, tm(f )] = 1

m, [m, f ] + 2f ]} + (i/h)2m2([m, f ] + 2f ),

2 ab{ b

m, [ a

the action (4.12) is only a solution of (4.19) i

[m, f ]wm = 2f

=

z d2 2

2f

2a()

b()a

b + vmf = 2f,

where the second equation follows from the rst one by taking into account the condition

(4.13). on the other hand, the expression on the lefthand side (modulo the signum of

f ), can never be negative, since f depends only on a which has positive weyl weight,

sgn(f )nz d2 2

2f

2a()

b()a

b + vmfo  0.

this proves that the new ghost number conservation is broken through gauge xing.

5 generating functionals and gauge (in)dependence

next, we turn to the question of gauge (in)dependence of the generating functionals of

greens functions [13, 8].

(a) sp(2)covariant approach

in discussing this question it is convenient to study rst the symmetry properties of the

vacuum functional z(0) dened as

z(0) = z da() d a() ( a()) exp{(i/h)(wext + sx)}.

here, ( a()) is a density having the form of a functional,
( a()) = (cid:18)z d2 a()(cid:19),

and sx is given by

sx = z d2 a()a().

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

the term sx can be cast into the (anti)brstinvariant form

sx = 1

2ab(cid:16)v b(v ax  xu a) + (v ax  xu a)u b(cid:17),

x  z d2 2 a()a(),

with v a  v a

+, whose action on a() and a() are dened in eqs. (3.19)
and (3.24), respectively, satisfying {v a, v b} = 0 and {u a, u b} = 0. let us combine the

+ and u a  u a

action of v a and u a on an arbitrary functional y according to

lay  v ay  (1)(y )y u a,

{la, lb} = 0,

20

then the operators la are nilpotent and anticommuting.

inserting into expression (5.1) the relation (4.5) and integrating by parts this gives

z(0) = z da() d a()( a()) exp{(i/h)(w + sx + sf )}

(5.4)

with the following expression for sf :

sf = z d2n f

a()

2a()

2 + 1

2abz d2 

a()

2f

a

a()b( )

b()
 b o.

(5.5)

this may be cast also into the (anti)brst invariant form

sf = 1

2abf u bu a.

then, by virtue of lasx = 0 and lasf = 0, it can be checked that the integrand of the

vacuum functional (5.4) is invariant under the following global (anti)brst transforma-

tions (thereby, one has to make use of eq. (4.7)):

a() = a()u aa,

 a() = av a a() + a(w, a())a,

(5.6)

where a, (a) = 1, is a sp(2)doublet of constant anticommuting parameters. here,
we have taken into account that the density ( a()) = (a) is invariant under the
transformations (5.6). these transformations realize the (anti)brst symmetry in the

supereld approach to quantum gauge theory.

the invariance of z(0) under the transformations (5.6) permits to study the question

whether z(0) is independent on the choice of the gauge. indeed, let us change the gauge

xing functional f  f + f . then, the gaugexing term sf changes according to

sf  sf +f = sf + sf ,

sf = 1

2 ab(f )u bu a.

(5.7)

now, we perform in the vacuum functional (5.4) the transformations (5.6) and choose the

parameters a as follows,

a = (i/h) 1

2ab(f )u b.

thereby we induce the factor exp(au a) in the integration measure. combining its ex-

ponent with sf leads to

sf  sf + (h/i)au a = sf  1

2ab(f )u bu a = sf  sf .

by comparison with (5.7) this proves that the vacuum functional and, therefore, also the

smatrix is independent on the choice of the gauge.

21

(b) osp(1,2)covariant approach

in this approach the vacuum functional zm(0), which depends on the additional mass

parameter m, is dened as

zm(0) = z da() d a()( a()) exp{(i/h)(wm,ext + sm,x)},

with

sm,x = sx + m2z d2 2 a()a

bb(),

where sx again is given by eq. (5.3). the term sm,x can be rewritten as

(5.8)

(5.9)

sm,x = 1

m) + (v a

respectively; the action of (v a

, v) and (u a
(3.20)(3.22) and (3.25)(3.27), respectively.

, u) on a() and a() are dened by eqs.

inserting into the expression (5.8) the relation (4.12) and integrating by parts this

yields

with

zm(0) = z da() d a() ( a()) exp{(i/h)(wm + sm,x + sm,f )},

(5.11)

sm,f = sf  1

b ,

{la

m, lb

m} = m2()abl.

by using this algebra, after tedious but straightforward computations, one veries the

following relations:

lc

m( 1

2ablb

mla

m + m2) = 1

2m2()c

dld

ml,

[l, 1

2ablb

mla

m + m2] = 0.

therefore, it holds la

msm,x = 0 and lsm,f = 0, since x and f are sp(2)invariant.
because wm exhibits the same dependence as sm,x, eqs.
(4.13), (5.3) and (5.9),
wm + sm,x is independent on a and, hence, the integration over a with the density
( a()) = (a) yields a constant factor which is equal to one.

we assert now that the integrand in (5.11) is invariant under the following global

transformations (thereby, one has to make use of the eqs. (4.9) and (4.10), respectively):

a() = a()u a

ma,

a() = a()u,

 a() = av a
a() + a(wm, a())a
 a() = v a() + {wm, a()},

m

(5.12)

(5.13)

where a, (a) = 1, and , () = 0, are constant anticommuting resp. commut-
ing parameters. notice, that in the present case ( a()) is not invariant under the
transformations (5.12). the transformations (5.12) and (5.13) realize the mextended

(anti)brst and sp(2)symmetry, respectively.

next, we study the question whether the mass dependent terms in zm(0) violate the

independence on the choice of the gauge. proceeding as in the previous case, by changing

the gaugexing functional f  f + f the gaugexing term changes according to

sm,f  sm,f +f = sm,f + sm,f ,

sm,f = 1

2ab(f )u b

mu a

m + m2f.

(5.14)

now, carring out in (5.11) the transformations (5.12), we choose

a = (i/h) 1

2 ab(f )u b
m,

which leads to

sm,f  sm,f + (h/i)au a

m = sm,f  1

2ab(f )u b

mu a

m = sm,f  sm,f + m2f.

by comparison with (5.14) we observe that the mass term m2f violates the independence

of zm(0) on the choice of the gauge. one may try to compensate this undesired term
m2f by means of an additional change of variables using the transformations (5.13).

but this change should not destroy the form of the action arrived at the previous stage.

however, such additional changes of variables lead to a berezinian which is equal to one

because  are traceless. thus, the unwanted term could never be compensated.

6 irreducible and rststage reducible massive theo-

ries with closed algebra

in the preceeding sections we gave a general framework of quantizing massive general

gauge theories by introducing on the space of superelds and superantields a set of

dierential operators which obey the superalgebra sl(1, 2). thereby, we extended our

previous work [8] on osp(1, 2)covariant quantization where we already considered the

case of irreducible and rststage reducible gauge theories with closed algebra. in order

to illustrate our present approach let us study how the construction of these theories is

extended now. (thereby we also simplify some of our former calculations.)

(a) generic form of the dependence on the antields

our aim here is to construct a proper solution sm of the classical master equations

2(sm, sm)a + v a

msm = 0,

2 {sm, sm} + vsm = 0,

1
2 {sm, sm} + vmsm = 0,

(6.1)

which are obtained from the quantum master equations (4.9), (4.10) and (4.17) at the

lowest order approximation of h. let us rewrite more explicit the brackets in eqs. (6.1)

using their denitions, eqs. (4.4), (4.11) and (4.18),

the symmetry properties (6.2) of sm may be expressed also by the following equations:

sa
msm = 0

dsm = 0,

dmsm = 0,

(6.3)

with sa

m  sa

+ + 1

2m2sa

 and dm  d + m/m, where the operators sa

() a

{sa

(6.4)

indeed, let us restrict our considerations to solutions sm being linear with respect to

the antields. let us remark that proper solutions of the classical master equations for

theories with closed gauge algebra and vanishing new ghost number depends only linearly

on the antields [16]. such solutions can be written in the form [8]

sm = scl + ( 1

2absb

msa

m + m2)x,

(6.5)

where x is assumed to be a sp(2)scalar (in fact the only one we are able to build up

linear in the antields) and, in accordance with the requirement (2.10), to have weyl
weight (x) = ( a) + (a) = 2,

x = aa

with

dx = 0,

dmx = 2x.

(6.6)

then, by making use of the osp(1, 2)  u(1)superalgebra of these symmetry operators,

[dm, dm] = 0,

[dm, d] = 0,

[d, d] = 



 d,

[d, sa

m] = sb

m() a
b ,

one establishes the following relations:

[dm, sa

{sa

m, sb

m] = sa
m,
m} = m2()abd,

m( 1

d( 1

dm( 1

2m2()c
2absb
msa
msa
2absb

md,

dsd
m + m2)d,
m + m2)(dm + 2).

from these relations, by virtue of (6.6), it follows that the ansatz (6.5) for sm really obeys

the symmetry requirements (6.3). thereby, it has to be taken into account that for the
classical action scl(a) it holds sa

mscl(a) = 0 as well as dscl(a) = 0 and dmscl(a) = 0.

in order to convince ourselves that the equations (6.3) can be cast into the form (6.2)

let us decompose sa

m, d and dm into a component acting on the elds and another one

acting on the antields as follows:

sa

m = (cid:0)sa

ma(cid:1)

l
a + v a
m,

d = (cid:0)da(cid:1)

l
a + v,

dm = (cid:0)dma(cid:1)

l
a + vm.

(6.7)

25

the assumptions (6.6) are satised if the action of d and dm on a is dened as

da = b() a
b

and

dma = ba
b.

then from (6.5) one gets for sm the expression

sm = scl + (a + 1

2m2b

a

b)a  (sa

ma)

aa + a( 1

2absb

msa

m + m2)a

with b

a  2b

a = b

a . now, performing in (6.3) the replacements sa

aa,
b it is easily seen that both symmetry
requirements, eqs. (6.2) and (6.3), are equivalent to each other. thus, we are left with

b and dma = sm/ba

da = sm/b() a

ma = rsm/

the exercise to determine the action of the sl(1, 2)superalgebra (6.4) on the components

of the elds a. thereby, we restrict ourselves to the cases of irreducible and rststage

reducible theories with closed gauge algebra.

(b) explicit realization of sl(1,2) on the elds: irreducible gauge theories
for irreducible theories with a closed algebra, because of m ij

00 = 0, the algebra of the

generators, eq. (2.2), reduces to

ri

0,jrj

0  ri

0,jrj

0 = ri

0f 0

00,

(6.8)

where for the sake of simplicity we assume throughout this and the succeeding subsection
that the ai are bosonic elds. this algebra denes the structure tensors f 0

00. in general,
the restrictions imposed by the jacobi identity lead to additional equations with new

structure tensors. but in the simple case under consideration it leads only to the following
relation among the tensors f 0

00 and the generators ri

0:

00f 0
f 0

00  ri

0f 0

00,i + cyclic perm(0, 0, 0) = 0.

(6.9)

in order to construct the proper solution sm = scl + ( 1

m + m2)x, eq. (6.5), for
x one has to choose x = aiai + b0b0 + cac 0a. the sl(1, 2)transformations of the
antields ai, b0 and c0a already has been given (see appendix a). the corresponding
nonlinear realization of the sl(1, 2) in terms of the elds ai, b0 and c 0a reads

and (4) dilatations:

dai = 0,

dc 0b = c 0b,

db0 = 2b0.

(6.11)

(6.12)

(6.13)

by making use of eqs. (6.8) and (6.9) it is a simple exercise to prove that the transfor-

mations (6.10)(6.13) actually obey the sl(1, 2)superalgebra (6.4). let us remark that

the nonlinearity of the translations, eqs. (6.10), is due to the fact that the components

aa and a of the supereld a() have been eliminated from the theory by integrating

them out in eq. (5.11).

(c) explicit realization of sl(1,2) on the elds: firststage reducible gauge theories

now let us consider rststage reducible theories. in that case, due to the condition of

rststage reducibility,

ri

0z 0

1 = 0,

(6.14)

there are independent zeromodes z 0

1 of the generators ri

0. their presence does not

modify the gauge algebra

ri

0,jrj

0  ri

0,jrj

0 = ri

0f 0

00,

(6.15)

but it inuences the solutions of the jacobi identity which appears from the relation

rj

0(cid:0)f 0

00f 0

00  ri

0f 0

00,i + cyclic perm(0, 0, 0)(cid:1) = 0.

(6.16)

27

in addition, new equations and structure tensors occure. one of these gauge structure

relations is the reducibility condition (6.14) itself. in order to derive the others we proceed

as follows:

first, let us cast the jacobi identity (6.16) into a more practical form. owing to (6.14)

the expression in parenthesis must be proportional to the zeromodes z 0
1,

00f 0
f 0

00  ri

0f 0

00,i + cyclic perm(0, 0, 0) = 3z 0

1h 1

000,

(6.17)

000(a) are new structure tensors being totally antisymmetric with respect to

where h 1
the indices 0, 0, 0 and depending, in general, on the gauge elds ai.

next, we derive an expression for the combination z 0

1,jrj

0. multiplying (6.15) by z 0

1

and using the relation ri

0,jz 0

1 = ri

0z 0

1,j, which follows from (6.14), we obtain

ri

0(z 0

1,jrj

0 + f 0

00z 0

1) = 0.

again, this may be solved by introducing additional structure tensors g1

01(a)

1,jrj
z 0

0 + f 0

00z 0

1 = z 0

1 g1

01,

(6.18)

thus dening a new structure equation for rststage reducible theories. multiplying this
equation by z 0

1 and taking into account (6.14),

f 0
00z 0

1z 0

1 = z 0

1 z 0

1 g1

01,

we obtain the useful equality

z 0

1 g1

01 = z 0

1 g1

01.

(6.19)

moreover, we are able to establish two further gauge structure relations for the rst

stage reducible case showing that h 1

000 and g1

01 are not independent of each other.

the rst one reads

01g1
(cid:0)g1

01 + ri

0g1

01,i + antisym(0  0)(cid:1) + g1

01f 0

00 + 3z 0

1 h 1

000 = 0.

(6.20)

in order to verify this relation we multiply the jacobi identity (6.17) with z 0
of ri

1 = 0 this yields

0z 0

1 . by virtue

(f 0

00z 0

after replacing all terms of the form f 0

00,iz 0

(6.21)

this equation, since the algebra (6.15) is closed,

z 0

leads immediately to the gauge structure relation (6.20).

the second gauge structure relation, which can also be derived by means of the jacobi

identity, is given by

(6.22)

where the lefthand side is a totally antisymmetric expression with respect to (0, 0, 0, 0).

in order to prove that this relation is satised we consider the following identity:

(cid:8)(cid:0)(z 0

1 h 1

000)f 0
1 h 1

00 + cyclic perm(0, 0, 0)(cid:1)

1h 1

0(z 0

+ 2ri

000)(cid:9) + antisym(cid:0)0  (0, 0, 0)(cid:1)  0,

which can be veried by a direct calculation replacing the terms z 0

1 h 1

000 by the help

of the jacobi identity (6.17). taking into account (6.18) one obtains the equation

z 0

1(cid:8)(cid:0)h 1

000f 0
0h 1

00 + cyclic perm(0, 0, 0)(cid:1)
000,i  2g1

10h 1

+ 2ri

000(cid:9) + antisym(cid:0)0  (0, 0, 0)(cid:1) = 0.

29

after factoring out the zeromodes z 0

1 and using the identity

000f 0
(cid:0)h 1
 2(cid:0)h 1

00 + cyclic perm(0, 0, 0)(cid:1) + antisym(cid:0)0  (0, 0, 0)(cid:1)
000f 0

00  h 1

000f 0

00 + cyclic perm(0, 0, 0)(cid:1),

this equation acquires the form (6.22). the relations (6.13)(6.22) are the key equations

in order to derive the sl(1, 2)transformations of the elds for the rststage reducible

case.

in order to construct the proper solution sm = scl + ( 1

m + m2)x in that case
one has to choose x = aiai + b0b0 + b1ab1a + c0ac 0a + c1abc 1ab. a realization
of the sl(1, 2)transformations of the antields ai, b0, b1a, c0a and c1ab already has

(6.25)

(6.26)

by making use of eqs. (6.13)(6.22) after somewhat involved and tedious algebraic mani-

pulations it can be proven that the transformations (6.23)(6.26) really obey the sl(1, 2)

superalgebra (6.4). for some details of this work we refer to ref. [8] where similar calcu-

lations were performed for the osp(1, 2)superalgebra.

continuing in the same way, analogous considerations can be made for higher stage

reducible theories. but then, more and more new gauge structure tensors with increasing

numbers of indices and additional gauge structure relations appear which makes a study

of these theories quite complicated.

7 concluding remarks

in this paper we have revealed the geometrical content of the osp(1, 2)covariant la-

grangian quantization of general massive gauge theories. a natural geometric formulation

of that quantization procedure is obtained by considering osp(1, 2) as subsuperalgebra of

sl(1, 2), which is considered as the algebra of generators of conformal transformations in

two anticommuting dimensions. it is shown that proper solutions of the classical master

equations can be constructed being invariant under osp(1, 2)  u(1). the mdependent

extended brst symmetry is realized in superspace as translations combined with m

dependent special conformal transformations. the sl(2)  u(1) symmetry is realized in

31

superspace as symplectic rotations and dilatations, respectively. by the choice of a gauge

the sl(2)  u(1) symmetry is broken down to sl(2)  sp(2). in principle, by formal ma-

nipulations it is also possible to construct proper solutions of the corresponding quantum

master equations. however, in doing so a serious problem is to provide a sensible de-

nition of the various operators of the quantum master equations, which do not make

sense when applied to local functionals. in this paper we have not adressed such problems

and related questions as the use of explicit regularizations and renormalizations schemes

and the discussion of the role of anomalies.
