abstract

the d-brane spectra in the type iib string theory compact-
ied on adsp+2  s 8p are computed using the k-theory ap-

proach. the results signal the existence of the mirror-symmetry-

analogue for d-branes, analogous to that rised in the context of

derived categories.

keywords: d-branes, string duality, superstring vacua.

1 introduction

d-branes play a signicant role in superstrings and superconfor-

mal eld theories. two of the most outstanding developments

in this direction have been achieved:

1. the generalized ads/cft correspondence [1], which relates

the superconformal eld theory on dp-branes placed at the orb-

ifold singularity and the type iib string theory compactied on
adsp+2  h 8p ;

2. the k-theory approach to d-brane charges [2, 3, 4], which

identies d-brane charges with elements of grothendieck k-

groups [5, 6, 7] of horizon manifolds.

in the present paper we use k-theory to compute the d-

brane spectra in the type iib string theory compactied on
adsp+2  s 8p.

2 d-brane spectra

let us consider the bre bundle

s 8p  b9p



b9p/s 8p

1

the k-groups characterizing this bundle are related by the exact

hexagon [7]

fk(b9p/s 8p)  fk(b9p)




fk(ss 8p)



fk(s 8p)





fk(sb9p)  fk(s(b9p/s 8p))

where  is the coboundary homomorphism. this hexagon is

the counterpart of the generalized ads/cft correspondence (cf.

[3]).

since

fk(b9p) = fk(sb9p) = 0 ,

the hexagon splits into the exact sequences

0  fk(ss 8p)  fk(b9p/s 8p)  0

0  fk(s 8p)  fk(s(b9p/s 8p))  0

(1)

(2)

the sequences (1) and (2) are related by t-duality.

the group fk(ss 8p) from (1) reproduces the d-brane spec-

which signals the existence of the mirror-symmetry-analogue for

branes, analogous to that rised in the context of derived cate-

gories [4].

3 vacuum manifold

using standard denitions [7], we obtain

fk(ss 8p) = 9p(bu ) ,

3

fk(s 8p) = 8p(bu ) ,

where bu is the inductive limit of the manifold

u (2n )/u (n )  u (n )

(3)

the vacuum manifold (3) has the following interpretation in

terms of d-branes [9]. when 2n coinciding branes are separated

to form two parallel stacks of n coinciding branes, their gauge

symmetry u (2n ) is spontaneously broken to u (n )  u (n ).

this situation generically allows for the existence of topological

solitons.
