abstract

in this paper we apply a variant of heisenbergs quantization method for
strongly interacting, non-linear elds, to solutions of the classical yang-mills
eld equations which have bad asymptotic behavior. after quantization we
nd that the bad features (i.e. divergent elds and energy densities) of these
solutions are moderated. from these results we argue that in general the
n-point greens functions for yang-mills theories can have non-perturbative
pieces which can not be represented as the sum of feynman diagrams. a
formalism for dealing with these non-feynman pieces via nonassociative eld
operators is suggested. these methods may also nd some application in
dealing with high-tc superconductors.

i. introduction

the quantization of strongly coupled, nonlinear elds is a dicult and still open prob-
lem. the success of qed and the standard model of electroweak interactions is largely due
to the small size of the coupling constants, which allows for the perturbative expansion of
physical quantities in terms of a power series in the coupling constants. this feynman dia-
grammatic technique is the standard method for dealing with weakly coupled theories. for
strongly interacting eld theories such as quantum chromodynamics (qcd) this procedure
can not be applied in energy regimes where the coupling constant is large. the theoretical
demonstration of connement and the determination of the mass spectrum of light mesons
and baryons are two examples where the perturbative techniques of quantum eld theory
are not good tools. these low energy qcd phenomenon must be dealt with as completely
nonperturbative, quantum eects.

a mathematical way of stating this basic diculty in qcd is that one needs some
nonperturbative method for calculating the n-point green functions of the theory. usually
these problems in strongly coupled eld theories are dealt with using numerical simulations,
but the computing power of modern computers does not yet permit, in general, the same kind
of precise comparison between theory and experiment as is found in qed or the electroweak
theory. even if the state of the art in lattice gauge theory calculations increases to the same
level of precision, it would still be desirable to have approximate, analytical methods for
investigating these non-perturbative aspects of qcd or any strongly coupled eld theory.
here we apply a nonperturbative method for calculating the n-point greens functions of a
theory which was originally proposed in the 50s by heisenberg (see refs. [1], [2] and [3]) to
deal with the strongly coupled, non-linear dirac equation. in this method one writes down
an innite system of equations which connects together all the n-point greens functions of
the theory. then by introducing some physically reasonable approximations one reduces this
innite system of equations into a nite system. here we apply this quantization procedure
to several classical solutions in su(2) and su(3) gauge theories. although these classical
solutions possess some interesting properties they also have bad features which are eliminated
or reduced after the heisenberg quantization is applied.

ii. classical singular solutions in su(2) and su(3) gauge

theories

in this section we examine several classical solutions for su(2) and su(3) yang-mills
gauge theories. these solutions all have similar, qualitative asymptotic behavior: one part
of the classical gauge potential diverges as a power law and another part oscillates strongly.
in this section we follow the notation and conventions of ref. [4].

eqs.
t = f () was a conning,
power law potential and a2
z = v() was a strongly oscillating potential . depending on the
relationship between the initial conditions v(0) and f (0) the energy density near  = 0 was
either a hollow (i.e. an energy density less than the asymptotic value) or a hump (i.e. an
energy density greater than the asymptotic value). on account of this and the cylindrical
symmetry of this solution we called this the string solution.

b. su(3) bunker solution

next we considered the following su(3) ansatz for the gauge elds [5] [6] [7] :

a0 =

i =(cid:16)a

here a are the gell - mann matrices; a = 1, 2, . . . , 8 is a color index; the latin indices
i, j, k, l = 1, 2, 3 are space indices; i2 = 1; r, ,  are spherically coordinates. substituting
eqs. (6) into the yang - mills equations (2) gives the following system of equations for
f (r), v(r), w(r) and (r)

r2f  = f 3  f + 7f v2 + 2vw  f (cid:16)w2 + 2(cid:17) ,
r2v = v3  v + 7vf 2 + 2f w  v(cid:16)w2 + 2(cid:17) ,
r2w = 6w(cid:16)f 2 + v2(cid:17)  12f v,
r2 = 2(cid:16)f 2 + v2(cid:17)  4f vw.

(7a)

(7b)

(7c)

(7d)

this set of equations is dicult to solve even numerically so we investigated simplied cases.

first we examined the f =  = 0 case, under which eqs. (7) became

r2v = v3  v  vw2,
r2w = 6wv2.

(8a)
(8b)

in the asymptotic limit r   the form of the solution to eqs. (8) approaches a form
similar to the string solution:

v  a sin (x + 0) ,
w  "x +
  1
3a2 = (  1).

cos (2x + 20)

x

# ,

(9a)

(9b)

(9c)

where x = r/r0 is a dimensionless radius and r0, 0, and a are constants. a numerical
investigation of eqs.
(8) was done in ref. [4]. since v(r) was strongly oscillating this
resulted in the space part of the gauge eld of eq. (6b) being strongly oscillating. the
ansatz function w(r) increased as some power of x as x  , which indicated a classically
conning potential.
the magnetic and electric elds associated with this solution can be found from aa

 the color index is a = 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 and for h a

for ea
 a = 2, 5, 7. the
asymptotic behavior of h a
 is dominated by the strongly oscillating function
v(r). later we will show that the quantum corrections to this solution tend to smooth out
these strongly oscillating elds. from eqs. (10) and the asymptotic form (9) the radial
components of the magnetic and electric have the following asymptotic behavior

the radial electric eld falls o slower than 1/r2 (since  > 1) indicating the presence of a
conning potential. the 1/r2 fall o of h a
r indicates that this solution carries a magnetic
charge. this was also true for the solutions discussed in refs. [5] [7].

this solution of the classical su(3) eld equations exhibits elds which lead to a classical
conning behavior, and which have similarities with certain phenomenological potential
models of connement. the most signicant draw back of these solutions is that they have
innite eld energy. in the case of the bunker solution one nds that the asymptotic form
of the energy density goes as

(12)

as  > 1 this energy density will yield an innite eld energy when integrated over all space.
this can be compared with the nite eld energy monopole and dyon solution [8]. however
it has been demonstrated [9] that the nite energy monopole solutions can not trap a test
particle while the innite energy solutions can.

c. the classical f,  6= 0 case

finally we examine the v = w = 0 case:

r2f  = f 3  f  f 2,
r2 = 2f 2

(13a)
(13b)

these equations have well known, nonsingular monopole solutions, but these monopole
solutions require special boundary conditions.
if one does not impose special conditions
then a more general solution is

f  a sin (x + 0) ,
  "x +

a2 = (  1).

(14a)

(14b)

(14c)

which is the same as the asymptotic form of the bunker solution, and thus shares its bad
long distance behavior. a numerical investigation of the solutions to eq. (13) also indicates
a similarity to the bunker solution. the magnetic and electric elds associated with
this solution are also similar to those of the bunker solution.

here the color indices a = 2, 5, 7 indicate that this is really an su(2) gauge potential embed-
ded within su(3). we now review the heisenberg quantization method in order to apply it
to these three solutions.

iii. heisenberg quantization of strongly interacting fields

heisenbergs basic idea is that the n-point greens functions can be found from some
innite set of coupled dierential equations, which are derived from the eld equations for
the eld operators. as an example we show how this method of quantization works for a
spinor eld with a nonlinear self interaction [1] [2] [3]. the basic equation for the spinor
eld is :



(x)  l2[ (x)((x) (x))] = 0

(16)

where  are dirac matrices; (x), (x) are the operators of the spinor eld and its adjoint
respectively; [ ( )] = ( ) or 5(5 ) or ( ) or 5(5 ). the con-
stant l has units of length, and sets the scale for the strength of the interaction. heisenberg
emphasized that the 2-point greens function, g2(x2, x1), in this theory diers strongly from
the propagator in a linear theory in its behavior on the light cone : in the nonlinear theory
g2(x2, x1) oscillates strongly on the light cone in contrast to the propagator of the linear
theory which has a -like singularity. heisenberg dened  functions

 (x1x2...|y1y2...) = h0|t [ (x1) (x2)...(y1)(y2)...]|i

(17)

where t is the time ordering operator; |i is a state for the system described by eq. (16).
eq. (17) establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the system state, |i, and the set
of functions  . this state can be dened using the innite function set of eq. (17). using
equation (16) and (17) we obtain the following innite system of equations for the  s

l2
(r)


x
(r)

 (x1...xn|y1...yn) = [ (x1...xnxr|y1...ynyr)] +
(xr  y1) (x1...xr1xr+1...xn|y2...yr1yr+1...yn) +
(xr  y2) (x1...xr1xr+1...xn|y1y2...yr1yr+1...yn) + ...

(18)

eq. (18) represents one of an innite set of coupled equations which relate various orders
(given by the index n) of the  functions to one another. to make some head way to-
ward solving this innite set of equations heisenberg employed the tamm-danko method
whereby he only considered  functions up to a certain order. this eectively turned the
innite set of coupled equations into a nite set of coupled equations.

heisenberg used the procedure sketched above to study the dirac equation with a nonlin-
ear coupling. here we apply this procedure to nonlinear, bosonic eld theories such as qcd
in the low energy limit. in particular by applying this method to the innite energy, solutions
just discussed, and making certain assumptions analogous to the tamm-danko cut-o, the
unphysical asymptotic behavior of these classical yang-mills solutions is smoothed out.
it is also possible that this quantization method could be applied to the recently proposed
[10] strongly interacting phonon theory of high-tc superconductors.

iv. quantization of singular classical solutions

before applying the above quantization method we make the following simplifying as-

sumptions :

6

1. the degrees of freedom relevant for studying the singular solutions (both classically
and quantum mechanically) are given entirely by the two ansatz functions f, v for
eqs. (4) or, v, w for eqs. (8) or f,  for eqs. (13). no other degrees of freedom arise
through the quantization process.

2. from eqs. (5), (9) and (14) one function is a smoothly varying function for large x,
while another function is strongly oscillating. we take the smoothly varying function
to be an almost classical degree of freedom while the oscillating function is treated as
a fully quantum mechanical degree of freedom. naively one might think that in this
way only the behavior of second function would change while rst function stayed the
same. however since both functions are interrelated due to the nonlinear nature of
the eld equations we nd that both functions are modied.

a. pedagogical example : weak anharmonic oscillator

as a pedagogical example we repeat some details of heisenbergs quantization method
as applied to the weak anharmonic oscillator [1]. this section is also intended as a reference
for when we apply this same procedure to the various classical yang-mills solutions. the
hamiltonian equations for the operators of the weak anharmonic oscillator are

q =

,

p
m
= 2

p
m

0 q  q3

(19a)

(19b)

here q and p are the operators of the canonical conjugate variables for the anharmonic
oscillator. the  functions are

 (k|n  k)eit = h0|t q(t1)q(t2)    q(tk)p(tk+1)p(tk+2)    p(tn)|i|t1=t2==tn=t

(20)

the hamiltonian operator equations yield the following system:

k
m

 (k  1|l + 1)  m2

i (k|l) =
ml (k + 3|l  1) + mh2 l(l  1)(l  2)

0l (k + 1|l  1) 
 (k + 1|l  3)

4

to a rst approximation this reduces to :

1
m
 (0|1) = 2

i (1|0) =
i
m

 (0|1),
0 (1|0)   (3|0)

this is not a closed system, but by making the following approximation:

 (3|0) =

h

0

 (1|0),

(21)

(22a)

(22b)

(23)

one can solve eqs. (22) to obtain:

 = 0 1 +

3
4

h

0! .

(24)

which coincides with the quantum mechanical solution as an expansion of order  : 1,0 =
(e1  e0)/h

b. the quantized su(2) gauge string

to apply heisenbergs quantization scheme to the yang-mills system of eq.

replace the ansatz functions by operators f (), v() as in [11]:

(4) we

f  +

v +

f 
x
v
x

= f v2

= v f 2

(25a)

(25b)

the primes denote derivatives with respect to the dimensionless radius x. taking into account
assumption (2) we let f  f become just a classical function again, and replace v2 in eq.
(25a) by its expectation value

f  +

v +

f 
x
v
x

= fhv2i
= vf 2

(26a)

(26b)

now if we took the expectation value of eq. (26b) and ignored the coupling to f on the
right hand side we would have an equation for determining hvi = h|v|i. however the two
nonlinear terms on the right hand side of eqs. (26a - 26b) show that a new object, hv2i
enters the picture so that eqs. (26a - 26b) are not closed. to obtain an equation for hv2i
we act on v2(x) with the operator (cid:16) d2

dx(cid:17) giving

dx2 + 1

x

d

(v2) +

(v2) = 2v2f 2 + 2(v)2

1
x

(27)

(28)

taking the expectation value of this equation gives the desired equation for hv2i

hv2i +

1
xhv2i = 2hv2if 2 + 2h(v)2i

again this equation is not closed due to the h(v)2i term. we could again try to nd an
equation for h(v)2i by the same procedure we employed for hv2i. this equation would
also not be closed. continuing in this way we would nd an innite set of equations. in
order to have some hope of handling this problem we need to make some approximation
to cut this process o. for the anharmonic oscillator heisenberg solved this by assuming
i  0 for large m or n. we try
p(t)p(t)    p(t)
that  (xx   x

two dierent approximations for the h(v)2i term and show that both yield similar large x
behavior that xes the innite eld energy problem of the classical solution. first we assume
that h(v)2i  hv2i. since h(v)2i is positive denite one picks the  sign so that the right
hand side of this assumption is also positive denite. under this assumption the equations
become

hv2i +(cid:18) 1

x  2(cid:19)hv2i = 2hv2if 2

f  +

1
x

f  = fhv2i

the approximate solution of eqs. (29a - 29b) is of the form

hv2i  v2

exp(x)

x

f  f + f0

exp(x)

x

where

f02 = fv2

2  2 = 2f 2



the second relationship can be written (using the rst relationship) as

 = f f +

v2
0

2f0!

(29a)

(29b)

(30a)

(30b)

(31)

(32)

although hv2i  +hv2i leads to unphysical exponentially growing solutions, the assumption
hv2i  hv2i leads to exponentially decaying solutions. thus under this latter assumption
we nd that the quantum mechanical treatment of this nonlinear system modies the bad
features of the classical solution. the asymptotic behavior of v goes from being strongly
oscillating (see eq.
(5b)) to decaying exponentially, while the asymptotic behavior of f
goes from being linearly increasing (see eq. (5a)) to also decaying exponentially. in some
intermediate region the two solutions should match up with one another. if the asymptotic
form for these ansatz functions are used in the energy density, e, of eq. (5c) we nd that
the eld energy is now nite. to calculate e we would replace the classical terms v2, f 2v2
by the appropriate quantum operator and take the expectation value. the hv2i term would
be handled according to the assumption we used for closing the equations.

c. quantized bunker solution

although the classical behavior of bunker solution is interesting due to its similarity
with certain phenomenological conning potentials, the innite eld energy discussed at the
end of section ii b strongly argues against the physical importance of this solution. one
possible escape from this conclusion is if quantum eects weakened or removed this bad long
distance behavior.

again in eq. (8) we replace the ansatz functions by operators w(x), v(x) [12]:

9

x2v = v3  v  v w2
x2 w = 6 wv2

(33a)
(33b)

here the prime denotes derivatives with respect to the dimensionless radius x. taking into
account assumption (2) we let w  w become just a classical function again, and replace v2
in eq. (33b) by its expectation value to arrive at

x2v = v3  v  vw2
x2w = 6whv2i

(34a)
(34b)

if we took the expectation value of eq. (34a) we would almost have a closed system of
dierential equations relating w and hvi. the hv2i term from eq. (34b) and the hv3i term
from eq. (34a) prevent the equations from being closed. applying the operation x22/x2
to the operator v2 and using eq. (34a) yields

x2(v2) = 2v2(v2  1  w2) + 2x2(v)2

(35)

if we took the expectation of the above equation with respect to uctuations in the ansatz
function operator v2, and combined this with eq. (34b) we would almost have a closed
system for determining w and v2 except for the h(v)2i term on the right hand side of
eq. (35). continuing in this way one could obtain an innite set of equations for various
powers of the ansatz function operator (i.e. vn). as in the previous section we make some
assumption that eectively cuts o the system of equations at some nite order. we assume
that the mean square of the  component of the magnetic eld h = v is small 1

d( h)2e =(cid:28)(cid:16) h d he(cid:17)2(cid:29) = d h 2

e d he2

 0

that implies

d h 2
e  d he2

or

d(v)2e  (hvi)2

(36)

(37)

then by taking the expectation of eq. (35) we arrive at a closed system of equations from
eqs. (34a) (34b) (35)

x2hv2i = 2hv2i2  2hv2iw2  2hv2i + 2x2(hvi)2

x2w = 6whv2i
x2hvi = hvi3  hvi  w2hvi

(38a)
(38b)
(38c)

here we have further assumed that hv4i  hv2i2 and hv3i  hvi3. note that the present
situation is slightly more complex than the quantization of the string solution of the previous
section since now we have three coupled equations rather than two. it is straightforward to
show that in the limit x   the closed system given by eqs. (38a) - (38c) is solved by

1in other words the uctuations of the h component of the magnetic eld are weak.

(39a)

(39b)

(39c)

eqs. (39a) - (39c) provide information about the behavior of the classical ansatz function
w, and the quantum ansatz function, v, via hvi and hv2i. the main point is that after
applying the heisenberg-like quantization procedure to the classical singular solution, the
innite increase of the ansatz function w, has changed to an acceptable asymptotic behavior
(i.e. one that leads to a nite eld energy). by replacing v2, w, (v)2 in eq.
(12) with
hv2i, w, (hvi)2  from eqs.
(39a) - (39c)  we nd that the eld energy density of the
quantized bunker solution takes the form

1
r6

e 

(40)

in the limit in which quantum uctuations become important (i.e. for non-abelian theories
which exhibit asymptotic freedom this means in the low energy or r   range) the energy
density goes from the form given in eq. (12) to that given in eq. (40). this gives a nite
eld energy. in the high energy or short distance regime we assume that the elds approach
the classical conguration of ref. [4] due to asymptotic freedom. this classical conguration
is well behaved at r = 0, but has an innite eld energy due to its divergence as r  .

d. the quantized f,  6= 0 case

finally, we employ the above quantization technique to the singular solutions of eqs.
(13) for the v = w = 0 case. again we replace the ansatz functions by operators f (x), (x)

x2 f  = f 3  f  f 2
x2  = 2  f 2

(41a)
(41b)

using assumptions similar to the previous sections we have the following equations for the
quantum function f , and the classical function :

x2 f  = f 3  f  fh2i
x2 = 2hf 2i

(42a)
(42b)

using the same assumptions (including the assumption about the weak uctuation) and
procedure as in the previous sub-section we can turn eqs. (42a) into a closed system of
equations for the expectation values of various powers of the ansatz function operators

x2h f 2i = 2h f 2i2  2h f 2i2  2h f 2i + 2x2(h fi)2
x2 = 2h f 2i
x2h fi = h fi3  h fi  2h fi

v. operator quantization for strongly interacting fields

in the previous sections we saw that strongly nonlinear elds (e.g.

non-abelian
gauge elds) can have nonlocal objects (the classical su(2) ux tube solution and the
su(2),su(3)bunker solutions) which have good long distance behavior after an appli-
cation of the heisenberg quantization procedure. this result is markedly dierent from the
situation for linear quantum eld theories with no or small self-interaction. in these cases
the quantum elds can not form static eld congurations such as monopoles, ux tubes,
or bunker solutions discussed above. in general one needs strongly interacting, nonlinear
theories in order for such objects to exist.

all of this may be an indication that the n-point greens functions in non-abelian
gauge theories can have some pieces which are not simply the sum of feynman
diagrams. physically, this would imply that some physical processes in non-abelian gauge
theories can not be explained solely in terms of the perturbative uctuations of eld quanta.
heisenberg may have had this situation in mind when he indicated [1] that the divergence
behavior in a theory with strong interactions will dier from that found in a perturbatively,
renormalizable theory like quantum electrodynamics. in this section we want to rst present
some formal and then some heuristic arguments which support this idea of non-perturbative,
non-feynman contributions to the greens functions.

a. quantum eld theory with nonassociative eld operators

in this sub-section we consider eld operators which are nonassociative. there are two
reasons for doing this. first, in the heisenberg quantization scheme one problem (which was
dealt with by an approximate tamm-danko cuto) was the appearance of an innite system
of dierential equations with interrelated greens functions. nonassociative eld operators
can lead to a quantum theory where the greens functions are functionally independent
of one another, which would help this problem. second, a nonassociative quantum theory
can lead to amplitudes and processes which cannot be represented simply in a feynman
diagrammatic way by the exchange of virtual quanta. this supports the general picture
given in the introduction to this section.
in the following we will use the notations and
conventions of ref. [13].

12

in the standard, noncommutative quantum eld theories it is impossible to dene an
n-point greens function that is not some polylinear combination of propagators and inter-
action vertices. this general feature of the greens functions is altered if the eld operators
are nonassociative. if one considers the time-ordering of a product of n eld operators then
the time-ordering will result in a shifting of the positions of the individual eld operators.
in a noncommutative theory the shifting in the positions of the eld operators usually leads
to the appearance of a commutator. the time-ordering can also lead to a change in the
ordering of the brackets which group eld operators together. in a nonassociative theory
such a change in the ordering of the brackets leads to the appearance of an associator, just
as in a noncommutative algebra the displacement of an operator to the left or right gives
rise to a commutator. a good feature of nonassociative quantum eld theories is that one
can obtain n-point greens functions that are independent of each other.

we denote the product of n eld operators in which the brackets are arranged in accor-

dance with some rule p by mn(p ). for example,

m3(p ) = (cid:16)( x y) z(cid:17),

(46)

where x = (x) is the eld operator at the point x; in this case, the rule p is that all
opening brackets are at the extreme left hand position.

we call this ordering of the brackets for any number of operators, ( i.e. with all opening
brackets in the extreme left hand position) the normal position ordering of the brackets, and
denote it by colons

: mn(p ) :=  (cid:18)  (cid:16) 1( 2   (cid:19) n!,

(47)

on the left there are n opening brackets in succession.

next, we consider a nonassociative quantum eld theory with the following axioms.
1. two monomials mn(p1) and mn(p2) that dier only in the placement rule of the
brackets dier from each other by a numerical function a(x1, x2, . . . , xn; p1, p2), which we
call the n-point associator:

mn(p1)  mn(p2) = a(x1, x2, . . . , xn; p1, p2).

(48)

2. the action of the product of two monomials on the quantum state vector |vi is dened

as follows:

(cid:16)mn(p1)mk(p2)(cid:17)|vi = mn(p1)(cid:16)mk(p2)|vi(cid:17),
hv|(cid:16)mn(p1)mk(p2)(cid:17) =(cid:16)hv|mn(p1)(cid:17)mk(p2).

3. we have the usual commutation rules

[ x, y] = g(x, y),

(49a)

(49b)

(50)

where g(x, y) is the 2-point greens function (propagator) which diers from the propagator
of a linear theory.

as an example of this formalism we examine the following simplied model, in which the

action of any eld operator on the vacuum state annihilates it

13

now the 3-point associator is given by

x|vaci = hvac| x = 0.

( x y) z = x( y z) + a(x, y, z).

(51)

(52)

using the rules introduced above for the action of the eld operators on the vacuum state,
we nd that a(x, y, z) = 0. there are two 4-point associators given by

(cid:16)( x y) z(cid:17) u = ( x y)( z u) + a1(x, y|z, u),
x(cid:16) y( z u)(cid:17) = ( x y)( z u) + a2(x, y|z, u),

(53a)

(53b)

acting on each of eqs.(53a) from the right and left with the vacuum state and using the con-
dition (51), the 4-point associators a1,2 can be expressed in terms of the vacuum expectation
value of the monomial ( x y)( z u):

a1,2(x, y|z, u) = a(x, y|z, u) = hvac|( x y)( z u)|vaci.

(54)

x  y, z  u (x, y, z and u are 4-vectors). using the commutation properties
of the operators, the property of the vacuum state, and taking the points to be pairwise
spacelike (x  y, z  u) we can establish the following symmetry properties of the
4-point associator:

a(x, y|z, u) = a(y, x|z, u) = a(x, y|u, z).

the greens function can now be dened as

t (mn(p )) = mn(p ) + g(x1, x2, . . . , xn; p ),

(55)

(56)

where t denotes the ordinary time ordering of the operators in the monomial mn(p ), and
also normal ordering of the brackets in the monomial mn(p ). thus each n-point greens
function can be expressed in terms of a polylinear combination of n-point associators (m  n)
and propagators.

b. heuristic argument for non-feynman contributions to the greens functions

in carrying out our approximate application of heisenbergs quantization method to
certain classical, singular solutions, we examined only two degrees of freedom (f and v, v
and w or f and ). in each of these pairs one function was taken as a quantum degree of
freedom and the other remained a classical degree of freedom. to investigate this method
further one could drop this assumption by treating both functions as quantum degrees of
freedom. in this section we look at a broader issue of how to include the other frozen degrees
of freedom. in other words the quantization process might lead to more degrees of freedom
beyond the original classical degrees (e.g. f and v).

our main assumption in addressing this question is that for any n-point greens function,
for strongly interacting, nonlinear elds, there is a non-perturbative piece which can be

14

treated by the heisenberg quantization method 2. in the classical region these degrees of
freedom region can be associated with classical (possibly singular) eld congurations. the
others degrees of freedom are then handled using ordinary perturbative methods (i.e. using
feynman diagram techniques).

physically, this means that in a theory with strongly interacting elds one has:

1. nonlocal static objects, formed by those quantum degrees of freedom which are con-

nected with (possibly singular) solutions of the classical eld equations.

2. the quanta which uctuate around these nonlocal objects.

in terms of qcd this implies that there are degrees of freedom which play a dominate
role in the feynman path integral to a rst approximation. these degrees of freedom are
connected with classical (possibly singular) solutions of the yang-mills eld equations. this
is somewhat similar to the saddle-point method of evaluating the feynman path integral.
however, in the saddle-point calculation one approximates the path integral via the value
of the action evaluated at a particular solution

z des[]  es[0]

(57)

here  is a eld degree of freedom (in our case it is the non-abelian potential aa
), and 0 is
a classical, nonsingular solution of the eld equations. for singular, classical solutions this
approximation is not valid. instead one can as a rst approximation take

z des[]  z dcles[cl]

(58)

here cl represents the ansatz functions used in the classical eld equation. for the ansatz
functions of eq. (7) (f, v, w, ) the integration would become dcl  df dvdwd. this
leads to the following expression for the path integral

are the classical solutions in terms of the ansatz functions, and (aa

here (aa
)
are the
perturbative, quantum deviations from the classical solution. the rst integral is calculated
by some nonperturbative method (lattice gauge calculation, heisenberg method etc.). the
second path integral can be handled by ordinary perturbative methods (feynman diagrams).
at this point one can ask how renormalization ts in with the above development where
the greens functions contain a non-perturbative piece. in the standard perturbative treat-
ment of a quantum eld theory one must introduce a renormalization prescription. the
physical basis for this can to some extent be traced to the point-like nature of the quanta
and interaction vertices. mathematically the divergences come from momentum integrals
over closed loops which have propagators (which are distributions in linear eld theories)
raised to some power.
in the developments of the previous sections, where the n-point

15

greens functions have a non-perturbative part due to the non-linear nature of the quan-
tized elds, it is no longer necessarily true that the greens functions need to be distributions.
a generalization of the standard feynman diagram technique would represent any complete
n-point greens functions as the sum of two pieces : one the standard, perturbatively calcu-
lated eld uctuations, and the other would be the non-feynman part (possibly related to
nonsingular or weakly singular classical solutions). a similar situation arises in superstring
theory where the building blocks for the scattering diagrams are nonlocal strings. in both
the present case and in the case of string theory the divergences of the quantum theory are
eliminated or decreased 3.

vi. discussion and conclusions

the basic idea proposed here is that quantum eld theories with strongly non-
linear elds can have the non-feynman pieces. also the classical, possibly singular
solutions can play an important role in the corresponding quantum eld theory. after
quantization these classical solutions can lead to nonlocal objects with good long distance
behavior. these quantized nonlocal object are connected with the nonperturbative part of
the greens functions, and they are not the result of the perturbative quantum uctuations
of the eld.

this approach to the quantization of non-abelian eld theories is very similar to the
attempts to quantize gravity on the basis of the wheeler-de wit equation. in the present
case there is an important distinction : the operator of canonical momentum is not simply
related to the derivative of a canonical coordinate (i.e. p 6= 
 q where q is a eld operator).
this follows from the fact that the propagator has an unusual behavior on the light cone.
reversing the analogy between the non-abelian eld equations and the wheeler-de wit
equation one could postulate that the wheeler-de wit equation may be more complicated
than is normally written, since the momentum operator in gravity is also not simply the
ordinary derivative with respect to some corresponding eld variable.

in sections iv c and iv d we found two spherically symmetric nonlocal objects with good
asymptotic behavior after quantization. it may be possible to forge a connection between
these solutions and the qcd picture for the dressingof valence quarks by gluons and
quark-antiquark pairs. the authors of ref. [14] write: one views dressing as surrounding
the charged particle with a cloud of gauge elds. we . . . see that, . . . this cloud spreads out
over the whole space, resulting in a highly nonlocal structure. this is not unexpected in
qed, but in qcd we will see that there is a nonperturbative obstruction to the construction
of this dressing. the heisenberg quantization method that we have outlined might provide
a nonperturbative description of the above dressing procedure. if this is correct then our
results give structures which are dressed with gluons but not with quark-antiquark pairs

3a related question would be to investigate whether there is a classical, nonlinear eld theory
which after quantization resulted in n-point greens functions with non-perturbative pieces that
had a structure similar to p-branes. if so then one might consider string theory as a quantum eld
theory arising from some nonlinear (possible nonlocal) eld theory !

since we did not consider quark fermion elds in this work.

a. connection with the maximal abelian gauge model

the quantization method of non-abelian gauge elds given in this work shares some
common features with the abelian projection (ap) model of gluodynamics proposed by
t hooft in ref. [15]. the basic idea of the ap model is that in a non-abelian gauge
theory such as qcd there are special degrees of freedom which play an essential role in
connement. these degrees of freedom are connected with monopoles which appear in the
maximal abelian subgroup, h, of the full non-abelian group g. in the ap model the initial
su(3) eld equations are rewritten as an abelian gauge theory with magnetic monopoles
and some matter elds. roughly speaking, the ap method implies that the o-diagonal
gauge elds are excluded from consideration. more precisely one integrates over all the
o-diagonal (g/h) gauge elds, leaving only the abelian degrees of freedom [16].

su(3) gauge theory has monopole solutions, which at large distances look like u(1)
the solution exhibits 1/r2 behavior asymptotically). thus af-
abelian monopoles (i.e.
ter quantization these abelian monopole solutions should play a more important role in
comparison with the quantized solutions examined in sections iv c and iv d since these
quantized solutions have a faster fall o. this is in agreement with the ap model.

b. connection with high-tc superconductivity

the quantum theory of solids can be taken as a quantum eld theory on some lattice.
thus one could ask if the above formalism has an application to condensed matter systems.
for example can the quantized, classical solutions discussed above play a role in condensed
matter ? in ref. [17] it was shown that a ux tube solution can appear in superconductors
in the mixed state. in [10] a model of cooper pairing was proposed in which the phonons ex-
changed between cooper electrons are conned in a ux tube similar to the chromoelectric
ux tubes which are thought to occur between quarks and anti-quarks in qcd.

one possible application of such a model [18] might be as a mechanism to explain the
cooper pairing in high-tc superconductors. one could postulate that the lagrangian for
high-tc materials had a strong, nonlinear potential term. this could result in a classi-
cal, cylindrical solution (either singular or nonsingular), which after quantization via the
heisenberg-like method could give rise to a phonon ux tube that stretched between two
cooper electrons, binding them to much higher temperatures than in ordinary bcs super-
conductors.
