abstract

in this paper we further elaborate on the notion of fractional exclu-
sion statistics, as introduced by haldane, in two-dimensional confor-
mal eld theory, and its connection to the universal chiral partition
function as dened by mccoy and collaborators. we will argue that
in general, besides the pseudo-particles introduced recently by gu-
ruswamy and schoutens, one needs additional null quasi-particles
to account for the null-states in the quasi-particle fock space. we
illustrate this in several examples of wzw-models.

1. introduction

elementary excitations in low dimensional quantum many-body systems may exhibit

fractional statistics generalizing the usual bose and fermi statistics. in such cases the

single particle states available to an excitation may depend on the entire particle content of

the multi-particle state. to handle such systems haldane [1] introduced a particular form

of, so-called, fractional exclusion statistics where the statistical interactions are encoded

into a matrix gab. the thermodynamics of an ideal gas of particles satisfying haldanes

fractional exclusion statistics was subsequently worked out in a series of papers [2,3].

fractional exclusion statistics arises naturally in quasi-particle descriptions of two-

dimensional conformal field theories (cfts). here quasi-particles correspond to inter-

twiners (chiral vertex operators or cvos) between the various representations of the

chiral algebra and the (chiral) spectrum is constructed by repeated application of the

modes of a preferred set of cvos on the vacuum. inspired by [4,5], such a basis was rst

basis in particular illuminates the appearance of fundamental spinons in spin-s integrable

constructed for the (csl2)k1 wzw models [6,7] in terms of a j = 1/2 spinon eld. this
spin chains whose eective cft is an (csl2)k=2s wzw model [8].

the virtue of the quasi-particle approach to cft is that there is a simple method, de-

veloped in [9], to compute the thermodynamical properties of the quasi-particles and expose

their fractional exclusion statistics. this method involves truncating the quasi-particle

basis in momentum space and nding recursion relations for the associated nitized chiral

characters. from the recursion relations one immediately derives the (total) single-level

grand partition function tot for the quasi-particles and hence their statistical properties.

a large number of examples were subsequently worked out [914]. particularly interesting

applications of this approach include the study of the fractional exclusion statistics of the

edge quasi-particle excitations over abelian quantum hall states [13].

in many cases, including (csl2)k=1 wzw models [1,9] and zk parafermions [12,14],

it was discovered that the exclusion statistics of these cft quasi-particles is indeed of

the type introduced by haldane. all these examples involved quasi-particles with abelian

braid statistics, corresponding in the cft to intertwiners (cvos) with a unique fusion

path. the corresponding statistics is referred to as abelian exclusion statistics. at the

same time it was obvious that quasi-particles with non-abelian exclusion statistics, corre-

 1 

sponding to non-abelian braid group representations, do not satisfy exclusion statistics of

the type originally envisaged in [1,2]. recently, however, it was realized [15] that these

cases could be incorporated into haldanes scheme as well by allowing for pseudo-particles,

i.e., particles that do not carry any bare mass or energy. in particular, the non-abelian

exclusion statistics of (csl2)k>1 spinons (for k = 2, 3, 4) and generalized fermions in mini-

mal models mk+2 of cft (for k = 1, 2, 3) was shown to agree with the pseudo-particle
generalization of haldane statistics [15].

in a parallel development much progress has been made in the last few years in

the analytic calculation of the character formulas directly from a statistical mechanics

approach. these works generally involve the classication of all the eigenvalues of the

transfer matrix and the computation of their nite-size corrections. this was rst carried

out by the stony brook group by solving the bethe-ansatz type equations [16], and was

followed by the work of [17,18] which deals directly with the functional relations for the

eigenvalues. typically these calculations lead to the so-called fermionic (or quasi-particle)

type expressions for the characters of the representations of the chiral algebra. one can

again identify the quasi-particles in these fermionic characters, and they seem to be related

to the particle spectrum appearing in certain integrable perturbations of the underlying

cft [19,20].

based on the many known examples (see, e.g., [2028,7] and references therein), mc-

coy et al. (see, in particular, [29]) conjectured that all cft characters can be written in

the so-called universal chiral partition function (ucpf) form, which can be interpreted

as the grand partition function for a system of chiral particles with fugacities, and whose

single particle momenta satisfy certain fermionic counting rules. actually, it was noted a

few years earlier by the stony brook group [30] that such counting rules are very similiar

to haldanes exclusion statistics. the relation of exclusion statistics to models solvable

by the thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) was also noticed by bernard and wu [31].

thus it became natural to conjecture that the quasi-particles underlying the ucpf satisfy

haldane exclusion statistics with a statistical interaction matrix gab given by the bilinear

form matrix entering the ucpf. this was successfully demonstrated in a number of cases

corresponding to abelian exclusion statistics [32,13,12,29,14], but it was realized [14], and

conrmed for (csl2)k>1 spinons and generalized fermions in [15], that the most general form

of the ucpf involves quasi-particles with non-abelian exclusion statistics.

 2 

in this paper we will further elaborate on exclusion statistics in cft, and the connec-

tion with the ucpf. in particular, in sections 2 and 3, we will show that both lead to the

same eective central charge. furthermore, in section 4, we will argue that, in general,

to write characters of wzw models in ucpf form one needs to introduce, besides the

pseudo-particles, yet another kind of quasi-particles. these particles are composites of the

basic quasi-particles and account for the null-states in the quasi-particle fock spaces [33].

we will refer to these as null-particles. they can contribute to the ucpf either with

strictly positive or with alternating signs. we will incorporate these null-particles in hal-

danes scheme from the outset. in section 5 we discuss various examples, corresponding

to both abelian and non-abelian exclusion statistics. we compare the exclusion statistics

dened by the interaction matrix gab in the ucpf with the results obtained from the

recursion relation approach and nd complete agreement in all cases. we end with some

conclusions.

2. exclusion statistics with pseudo- and null-particles

exclusion statistics, as introduced by haldane [1] (and generalized to the multi-
component case in [3]1), is based on the idea that the number of accessible states d(a,k)
for a particle of species a and momentum k depends on the occupation number n(a,k) of

all other particles though a statistical interaction matrix g(a,k)(b,k) by

d(a,k) =  x(b,k)

g(a,k)(b,k) n(b,k) .

(2.1)

it follows that the total number of states w ({n(a,k)}), at xed occupation numbers
{n(a,k)} is given by

w ({n(a,k)}) = y(a,k)(cid:18) d0

(a,k) + n(a,k)  1 p(b,k) g(a,k)(b,k)n(b,k)

n(a,k)

(cid:19) ,

(2.2)

where d0

(a,k) is the total number of states available to particles of species a with momentum
k when there are no particles in the system. thus a gas of particles satisfying the above

1 for a dierent approach to exclusion statistics with internal degrees of freedom, see

[34].

 3 

exclusion statistics would have a grand canonical partition function given by

z = x{n(a,k)}

y(a,k)
(a)n(a,k) w ({n(a,k)}) expx(a,k)

n(a,k)(a  0

a(k))/kbt , (2.3)

where 0

a(k) and a are, respectively, the bare energy and chemical potential of the particle
of species a. in the sequel we shall specialize to the case of a one-dimensional ideal gas

where the particle interaction is localized in momentum space and encoded in a nite

matrix gab, i.e.,

g(a,k)(b,k) = k,k gab .

(2.4)

we have allowed for particles that contribute to the partition function (2.3) with alternat-
ing signs, i.e. a = 1, as opposed to the real particles with a = 1. we will see that they
occur naturally in the quasi-particle description of certain conformal eld theories.2 we
also partition the full set of particle species s into a set of physical particles sph, and a
set of pseudo-particles sps. the pseudo-particles do not carry any bare mass or energy
(i.e. 0
a(k) = 0), but have the unique role of exchanging internal degrees of freedom (color)
between the physical particles. in tba literature they arise in models with non-diagonal

scattering (see, for example, [3538]). pseudo-particles were recently introduced in hal-

danes framework in [15]. it also seems that they have been anticipated in [3] where the

case of one physical particle and several pseudo-particles was referred to as a hierarchical

basis.

in the thermodynamic limit where the system size m   with nite xed temper-
ature t > 0, a saddle point approach to the partition function (2.3) yields the following

most probable 1-particle distribution function [2]

(2.5)

and za = a exp((a0

the dressed energy for species a. one could proceed further, generalizing the computation

nary part to the chemical potential.

in [29], by using na to calculate the internal energy per unit length. alternatively, we

could work with the expression for the free energy obtained in [2,3]

of course well-known from related tba equations, cf. [38,39,36,40,34]) and leads to3

pseudo-particles induces subtraction terms in the eective central charge (2.12).

3. exclusion statistics in conformal eld theory

suppose we have a two-dimensional conformal eld theory with chiral algebra a, a

set of a-modules vi, labeled by some index set i  i, and intertwiners (cvos)

where i denotes the conformal dimension of vi and a = 1, . . . , dim vj. the number of
intertwiners i  j  i is given by the fusion rules nij
conformal eld theory the (chiral) spectrum is constructed by repeated application of the
modes of a preferred set of cvos on the vacuum |0i, i.e., a set of quasi-particle states of

(3.2)

where (k) = ik  ik1, constitute a basis of the a-module vi. this basis is overcom-
plete unless we put restrictions on the mode sequences (n1, . . . , nn ). these restrictions

are obtained both from the braiding and fusion relations satised by the intertwiners (3.1)

as well as by possible null-states in the fock space of intertwiners and may depend on the

fusion path (0, i1, i2, . . . , in ).

it has been observed in a variety of approaches  tba approaches, integrable spin

chains and also in the context of conformal eld theory  that the degrees of freedom con-

tained in (3.2) can be separated into physical excitations and pseudo-particle excitations.

loosely speaking, the physical excitations correspond to excitations over some reference

fusion path, while the pseudo-particles create excited fusion paths. while this separa-

tion might, strictly speaking, not hold in the conformal eld theory, it may hold in some

crystal limit (cf. [41]) which is sucient as far as the discussion of the partition function

is concerned. thus, if the quasi-particles in a conformal eld theory are described by hal-

dane exclusion statistics, we need to distinguish two kinds of particles: pseudo-particles

with vanishing bare energy and physical particles with an innite range of energy levels

separated by integers, i.e., we have the dispersion relation (2.8).

let us consider the partition function chi(y; q), i.e., the character of the a-module vi.
if we assume that the quasi-particle interaction is purely statistical according to (2.1), and

 6 

that a of (2.6) can be interpreted as the single quasi-particle grand partition function,
the character will have the following approximate form in the thermodynamic limit4

chi(y; q)  yas ps

a(yaqa ) yas phyl0

a(yaqa+l) .

(3.3)

of course the expression (3.3) is not meant to be exact but only valid, in general, in the

thermodynamic limit. we have chosen to write it in a discrete form, rather than in an

integral form like (2.9), to emphasize the discrete energy spectrum of the cft. also, the

product over a and l will be subject to restrictions depending on the sector i. cases where

the cft characters (or sums thereof) do admit exact factorizations of the form (3.3) have

recently been studied in [42].

the character chi(y; q) may be expanded as a power series in q

chi(y; q) = xn0

an (y) qn ,

(3.4)

it is well-known, of course, that modular transformations relate the asymptotic be-
haviour of an (y), for n  0, to the specic heat (2.10). for deniteness, let us see how
this works out using (3.3). asymptotically, we may approximate

an (y) =

in the last step, we have omitted all terms that do not contribute to the leading n be-

(3.7)

4 the modular parameter q is related to the quantum spin chain quantities by q =

exp(2v/m kbt ), thus m   (at xed t > 0) corresponds to q  1.

 7 

from (3.6) we can identify ce (y) with the eective central charge of the partition function

(3.3) as shown in, e.g., [43,44]. note that (2.11) and (3.7) indeed imply that we can also

identify ce (y) with the c computed in the previous section.

for future use, note that if all the chemical potentials a, for a  sph, are given in

terms of a single chemical potential  as a = a, then we may write (3.7) as

(3.8)

(3.9)

the central charge c = ce + min of the conformal eld theory follows from (2.12)

and (2.13) in the limit of vanishing chemical potentials, i.e. ya = a, where we need to
take those solutions to (2.13) that satisfy 0  a, a  1 for a = 1 and 1  a, a  0
for a = 1. for the latter case, the imaginary part of the corresponding dilogarithm is
precisely canceled by the logarithm term in (2.12). indeed, for x < 0,

log(1  x) = l(cid:18) 1

(3.10)

an interesting development over the last few years has been the derivation of quasi-

particle type character formulas for the modules of chiral algebras (see, e.g., [2028,7]).

this work has led to the conjecture that all conformal eld theory characters can be written

in the so-called universal chiral partition function (ucpf) form (see, in particular, [29])

where g is an n  n matrix and a and u are certain n-vectors. both a and u as well
as the restrictions on the summations over the quasi-particle numbers ma will in general

depend on the sector i, while g will be independent of i. furthermore, we have dened

(3.12)

it has been conjectured by various groups (see, in particular, [29]) that the quasi-particles

underlying (3.11) satisfy haldane exclusion statistics with statistical interaction matrix

 8 

given by the same matrix g as the one entering (3.11). we will refer to this conjecture as

the ucpf-exclusion statistics conjecture.

a convincing piece of evidence in support of this conjecture is that the asymptotics
of the character (3.11) (in the thermodynamic limit q  1) is given by exactly the same
formulas (2.12) and (2.13) where a = 0 for ua =  (physical particles), while a = 1 for
ua <  (pseudo-particles). the asymptotic form of the character (3.11) for ya = 1 was
derived in [44] (see also [45,43,46]). the present result is a straightforward generalization

of these derivations.

to prove the conjecture beyond the comparison of thermodynamics requires an exact

computation of the partition function starting from rst principles, i.e., eqn. (2.1), as has

been done for g-ons [32]. alternatively, it has been argued that the analytic continuation
of (2.12) to the covering space of c\{0, 1} contains information about all the excitations in
the spectrum. this idea has been successfully applied to some minimal models of conformal

eld theory [17], (generalized) parafermions [47], (csln)k=1 wzw models [48] and (csl2)k1

wzw models [49] and might be put on a more rigorous footing.

exclusion statistics in conformal eld theory can be studied by a method based on

recursion relations for truncated characters [9]. truncated characters p (i)
l (y; q) are dened
by taking the partition function of those states (3.2) where all the modes satisfy ni+(i) 
l. thus, for large l, we will have (cf. (3.3))

p (i)

l (y; q)  yas ps

a(ya) yas ph y0ll

a(yaql) ,

(3.13)

where the products are subject to certain restrictions depending on the sector a. thus

p (i)
l+1(y; q)/p (i)

l (y; q)  yas ph

a(yaql) ,

as l   .

(3.14)

more generally, if some of the physical particles a  sph are composites of a more funda-
mental particles, then their modes will be cut o at al and we nd

p (i)
l+1(y; q)/p (i)

l (y; q)  yas ph

a(yaql)a = tot(yaql) ,

(3.15)

where tot is dened in (3.9). therefore, from recursion relations for the truncated charac-
ters p (i)

l (y; q) in the large l limit, one derives algebraic equations for the total 1-particle

 9 

partitions functions tot(y), which can be compared to the tot(y) arising from a solution

of (2.6), with a statistical interaction matrix as suggested by the ucpf formula (3.11).

this procedure was carried out, and agreement was found, in several cases including g-ons

(the one-component case of (3.11)) [32,29] and several multi-component cases [9,13,12,14].
all these cases involve only physical particles (ua = ), i.e., correspond to intertwiners
with a unique fusion path, and the corresponding statistics was therefore called abelian

exclusion statistics. from (2.6) it is clear that the absence of pseudo-particles always leads
to small x expansions of the form a(x) = 1 + xa + o(x2). in [10,14] it was observed,
however, that generally we have expansions of the form a(x) = 1 + axa + o(x2), where
a is the largest eigenvalue of the fusion matrix of the quasi-particle a [14]. the exclu-
sion statistics corresponding to the more general case, a 6= 1, was named non-abelian
exclusion statistics. it was recently recognized that non-abelian exclusion statistics can

be accounted for in the haldane approach by incorporating pseudo-particles [15]. the

ucpf-exclusion statistics conjecture was subsequently conrmed in various non-abelian

cases, namely (csl2)k>1 wzw-models and generalized fermions in minimal models of cft

[15].

the main purpose of the remainder of this paper is to verify the ucpf-exclusion

statistics conjecture in various other, rather non-trivial, wzw-examples (both abelian and

non-abelian) for which ucpf characters have been found recently [33]. in all examples

we nd complete agreement, thus supporting the conjecture above. to nd agreement,

however, we have had to slightly extend the denition of the ucpf form to account for

certain null-particles, as remarked before.

4. towards the ucpf for wzw models

the following questions naturally arise. given a conformal eld theory, how does one

identify a set of quasi-particles in terms of which the characters take the ucpf form,

and how is the statistical interaction matrix g determined in terms of the conformal eld

theory data (chiral algebra, modules, fusion rules, conformal dimensions, etc.)? in this

section we will give a partial answer for wzw models.

thus far, only isolated cases of ucpf characters for ane lie algebras were known.

these included (csl2)k=1 [5,6], (csl2)k>1 [7] and (csln)k=1 [28,50].5 recently an algorithm

5 in principle one can get quasi-particle ane lie algebra characters by taking limits of

 10 

was given which, in principle, can be used to obtain ane lie algebra characters in ucpf

form for any ane lie algebrabg and at arbitrary level [33]. here we will briey explain

the idea, we refer to [33] for the technical details. in the next section we discuss some

examples, examine the exclusion statistics, and make a comparison to the results of [14].

let g be a simple nite dimensional lie algebra of rank , let {i}

i=1 be the set of
fundamental weights and l(i) the corresponding nite dimensional irreducible represen-
tations. as our set of quasi-particles we take the intertwiners6

a(cid:18) i

 (cid:19) (z) ,

a = 1, . . . , dim l(i) ,

(4.1)

(given by  and ) at level-k, as determined by the fusion rules ni

corresponding to all fundamental representations l(i) and between all possiblebg modules
csl3 we take intertwiners transforming in both the 3 as well as the 3 representation of sl3.

next, we need to decouple the pseudo-particle excitations, representing the excited fusion

. for example, for

paths with respect to a reference fusion path, from the physical excitations. the sums over



pseudo-particle excitations are well known from rsos and spin chain models and yield, up
to a factor, level-k restricted modied hall-littlewood polynomials m (k)

 (y; q) (or kostka-
foulkes polynomials in the case of sln) for which, in some cases, ucpf expressions are

known (see, e.g., [51,44,46,52] for y = 1). on the other hand, the physical excitations

would yield a (fock space) contribution to the character given by

where mi is the total number of intertwiners in l(i) and we have specialized to the case

where all particles in l(i) have the same fugacity yi. the bilinear form matrix b is given,
in the case of simply laced lie algebras, by the inverse cartan matrix a1

ij = (i, j)

the w-algebra minimal model characters (i.e., coset characters) of, e.g., [44]. these will
however involve an innite number of pseudo-particles and are not of the type considered
here.

6 while in some level-1 cases it is possible to give the character in a ucpf form using
less quasi-particles than the ones discussed here, these formulas do not seem to generalize
to level k > 1 just by the inclusion of additional pseudo-particles. we refer to section 5.6
for an example.

of g and arises from the mutual locality of the basic vertex operators exp(ii  ). for
non-simply laced lie algebra these vertex operators have to be corrected by fermionic
2|i|2 and the conformal dimension i =
operators to account for the dierence between 1
(i, i + 2)/(h + 1) of vi at level k = 1  the corresponding b easily follows from [53].
combining these two ingredients gives the required result for, e.g., (csl2)k1 (see section

5.1). unfortunately, in general this is not the whole story as we have not yet incorporated

the possible null-states in the physical quasi-particle fock space. it turns out, as discussed

in [33], that these can be accounted for in ucpf form by interpreting the fock space

modulo null-states as the coordinate ring of an anized projective variety and applying
standard techniques from algebraic geometry. besides deforming the exponent 1

 (y; q) and m(y; q) are, respectively, the

the procedure leading to (4.4) is not unique, however, and various equivalent ucpfs
with dierent null quasi-particle contents may be given (see the examples in section 5).7

the equality between the characters with the various null-state subtractions is based

on the successive application of the following two identities (see, e.g., [50] for an elementary

proof)

(q)m (q)n

which are, in a sense, inverses of each other. both identities are specializations of the
q-chu-vandermonde identity for the basic hypergeometric q-series 21 (see, e.g., [56]).8
both are intimately related to, and in fact constitute a proof of, the ve-term identity for

rogers dilogarithm

l(x) + l(y) = l(xy) + l(cid:18) x(1  y)

(4.7)

indeed, by comparing ce (y) for the asymptotics of two characters related by a single

application of either (4.5) or (4.6) one discovers (4.7). denoting the solutions of (2.13) for

the corresponding variables on the left hand side of (4.5) and (4.6) by (1, 2) and on the
right hand side by (

(4.9)

with the use of (2.12) and (3.10) both lead to (4.7). the fact that the characters of the

various null-particle formulations always seem to be related by either (4.5) or (4.6) can be

taken as further evidence for the conjecture that, loosely speaking, dilogarithm identities

are always accessible by means of the ve-term identity (goncharovs conjecture, see

[46]).

having obtained the wzw characters in a ucpf form we can read o the statistical

interaction matrix g and verify whether the alleged exclusion statistics dened by (2.6)

indeed agrees with the exclusion statistics derived by the recursion method in [14]. we will

carry out this procedure in several non-trivial examples (section 5) and nd agreement in

all cases.

in [14] one of the authors and k. schoutens conjectured that the recursion relations

for the truncated characters p (i)

l (q) of the level-1 wzw models were, in all cases, solved

8 we are grateful to ole warnaar for pointing this out to us.

(upto an overall q-factor ) by modied hall-littlewood polynomials m(l,i)(q), with ar-
gument q  q1, and  a function of both i and l. thus, these modied hall-littlewood
polynomials have to approach the wzw characters chi(q) in the limit l  . this
observation leads to the conclusion that, asymptotically, m(l,i)(q) is given by an expres-

sion like (3.13). extrapolating this reasoning a bit further, using the fact that m(q), for

 = m11 + . . . + m, is precisely the tba-limit of the partition function of an inte-

grable spin chain with mi spins in the minimal uq(bg) anization wi of the fundamental

representation l(i) whose elementary excitations are precisely the quasi-particles (4.1)

[57], we are led to the conjecture that, asymptotically,

m(q)  qn()

yi=1

miyli=1

i(qli ) ,

(4.10)

where n () is such that m(q) = const + o(q) and the i are expressed in terms of the
a according to the fusion rules, i.e., according to which composites of the quasi-particles

a(cid:18) i

 (cid:19) (z) make up the sectors j. for sln we would have, more explicitly,

a (x)!bij
where bij is the inverse cartan matrix of sln and e(j)

i(x) = yj  ya e(j)

a

,

(4.11)

are the solutions (j)

a

to (2.6)

for the physical particles corresponding to (4.1) dressed with the s for the composite

null-particles which contain that particle. explicit formulas for i will be given in the

examples of section 5. note however that the modied hall-littlewood polynomial is a

q-deformation of the character of the tensor product of mi-fold copies of wi . thus, a

consistency check on the assertion (4.10) is that

i(1) = dim wi .

(4.12)

we will verify this in the examples. in fact, the analogous statement seems to be true in

the fact that limits of modied hall-littlewood (or kostka-foulkes) polynomials lead

higher level cases as well as suggested by the (csl2)k example in section 5.1.
to wzw characters for (csln)k was rst conjectured in [46] and subsequently proven, in

special cases, in [58,52].

5. examples

5.1. csl2, level-k

the (non-abelian) exclusion statistics for the case (csl2)k has been extensively discussed

in [59,11,14,15], where it was shown, among other things, that the solutions to the equation

(2.6) indeed agree with the expressions obtained from the recursion approach (at least for

small k). here we suce by making a few additional remarks.

at level-k there are k + 1 integrable highest weight modules of csl2 labeled by (twice)
the sl2 spin, 2j = 0, 1, . . . , k + 1. the character of (csl2)k1 can be written as [7,41,60]
(cid:21)

where ak is the cartan matrix of ak = slk+1, and (uj)a = a,2j. the restrictions are such
that all entries in the q-binomials are integers. this character is obviously of the ucpf

form (3.11) with

where the entries of g correspond to the summation variables {m+, m, m2, . . . , mk} in

(2.6) agrees with the one found by the recursion method [11,14]. also note that from (5.3)

it follows that the expression

(5.5)

at x = 1 is given by  = k + 1, which is consistent with the interpretation of the quasi-

particles as the excitations of an su (2) spin chain with 2s = k.

5.2. csl3, level-1

the ane lie algebra csl3, at level-k = 1, has three integrable representations corre-

sponding to the singlet 1, the vector 3 = l(1) and the conjugate vector 3 = l(2) of
sl3. as discussed in section 2, for the quasi-particles we take the intertwiners a(z) and
a(z) transforming in, respectively, the 3 and 3 representations. since at level k = 1 the

fusion path is unique, there will be no pseudo-particles. however, the quasi-particle fock

natural way of incorporating this null-eld is by introducing one null-particle with  = 1.

space will contain null-states as a consequence of the null-eldpa : a(z)a(z) :. the most

(5.9)

as remarked in section 2, the fugacity of the null particle is given in terms of that of
its constituents as y1y2. the central charge (2.12) works out correctly, as c = 2, with

to compare the exclusion statistics based on the statistical interaction matrix (5.8)

with the results of [9,14] we have to solve (2.6) with

{a} = {1, 2, 3 | 1, 2, 3 | } ,
{za} = {x, x, x|x2, x2, x2|  x3} .

in accordance with the results of [9,14].

the ane lie algebra csl4 at level k = 1 has four integrable highest weight modules,

corresponding to the singlet 1, the vector l(1) = 4, the rank-2 anti-symmetric tensor

as explained in section 4, once the results for the level k = 1 ucpf characters are known,

one can immediately obtain the level k > 1 characters by correcting for the level-k pseudo-

particles as in (4.3).

resentations, corresponding to the singlet 1, the vector v = 5 = l(1) and the spinor

the ane lie algebra cso5, at level k = 1, has three integrable highest weight rep-
s = 4 = l(2) of so5. the ucpf form of the (cso5)1 characters is obtained by combining

the results of [55,14,33]. in [55] the character was given in terms of (restricted) so5 kostka

polynomials and a recipe was given to compute the restricted kostka polynomial. explicit

expressions for the restricted kostka polynomial (corresponding to the pseudo-particle part

 20 

of the character) were given in [14] while in [33] the ucpf form of the physical particles

was found. the nal result requires one pseudo-particle, physical particles transforming in

the 5 and 4 of so5 and one null-particle (corresponding to the composite of two 5 particles).

the characters are given by (3.11) with

while there are also some restrictions on the summation over the mas (see [14]). note that

this case corresponds to order k = 2 non-abelian exclusion statistics in the sense of [15] as

far as the coupling of the pseudo-particle to the physical spinor-particles are concerned.

the physical vector-particles have a unique fusion rule and therefore do not couple to the

pseudo-particle.

in addition, from (5.27), we obtain that the expressions for

at x = 1 are given by, respectively, 1 = 5 and 2 = 4. again this is in complete agreement

with (4.12). the results in this section might prove to be useful with regards to certain

quasi-particle excitations (non-abelian electrons) in so(5) superspin regimes for strongly

correlated electrons on a two-leg ladder [61].

the ucpf and corresponding exclusion statistics for higher level cso5 modules can be

worked out using the results of [55].

5.6. csln, level-1, revisited

for (csln)k=1 it is also possible to give a description purely in terms of quasi-particles

(spinons) a transforming in the n-dimensional vector representation n. in this case the

it can be brought in the ucpf form by shifting the summation variables ma  ma + m
(for y 6= 1). then,

the corresponding equations (2.6) with {a} = {1, . . . , n|}, and {za} = {x, . . . , x|xn}
have the solution

so that indeed

(5.34)

tot = (1 . . . n)n = (1 + x + . . . + xn1)n .

(5.35)

it is also possible to write (5.32) in terms of a non-alternating sum by repeated appli-
cation of (4.6) and (4.5). besides the n spinons this requires n 2 additional null-particles

for sln. here give the result for csl3 (see [33] for the origin of this formula and the general-

and again conrming

(5.39)

in contrast to the ucpf formulas in section 4.2 and 4.3, it does not appear that the

formula (5.32) has a straightforward generalization to levels k > 1.

6. conclusions

in this work we have to tried to reconcile haldanes notion of exclusion statistics [1]

with the stony brook groups proposal of a universal chiral partition function form for

all (chiral) characters of two-dimensional conformal eld theories [29]. we have seen that

besides the pseudo-particles of [15], in general, this requires yet another kind of particles,

so-called null-particles. in support of the conjectured relation between haldane statistics

and the ucpf, we have shown that an ideal gas of physical, pseudo- and null-particles, with

linear dispersion relations, in the thermodynamic limit exhibits the same eective central

charge as the ucpf. it would of course be most desirable to extend this comparison to

the dierent sectors of the ucpf and gain an understanding of the restrictions that enter

the sum.

the ucpf was put forward to structuralize the form of the characters of cft. by

indicating how the characters of ane lie algebras may be written in the ucpf form by

introducing null-particles we have obtained further support for the alleged universality

of the ucpf.

to demonstrate this method we have discussed various examples of ucpfs for wzw-

models and the associated exclusion statistics and found agreement with previous results,

computed by the recursion method [9,14], in all cases.
