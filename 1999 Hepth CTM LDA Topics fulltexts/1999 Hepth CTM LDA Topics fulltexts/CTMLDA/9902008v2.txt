abstract

local conserved charges in principal chiral models in 1+1 dimensions are investigated.

there is a classically conserved local charge for each totally symmetric invariant

tensor of the underlying group. these local charges are shown to be in involution

with the non-local yangian charges. the poisson bracket algebra of the local charges

is then studied. for each classical algebra, an innite set of local charges with spins

equal to the exponents modulo the coxeter number is constructed, and it is shown

that these commute with one another. brief comments are made on the evidence for,

and implications of, survival of these charges in the quantum theory.

1 introduction

integrable lagrangian eld theories in 1+1 dimensions exhibit various kinds of higher-spin
conserved quantities which constrain their quantum behaviour, forcing their s-matrices

to factorize and allowing them to be determined exactly in many instances. such exotic
symmetries can usually be traced to underlying mathematical structures which incorporate
lie algebras in some way. beyond these broad similarities, however, one encounters many

examples with profound physical and mathematical dierences. one of the most important
distinctions is between conserved charges which are integrals of local functions of the elds,

and those which instead involve non-local functions of the elds.

local charges have been studied extensively in ane toda theories (atfts) for which

the dening lie algebra data are just a set of simple roots (plus the lowest root). each
atft possesses innitely many commuting local charges with spins equal to the exponents

of the lie algebra modulo its coxeter number h [1]:

a = su(+1)

b = so(2+1)

c = sp(2)

d = so(2)

1, 2, 3, . . . , 

1, 3, 5, . . . , 21
1, 3, 5, . . . , 21

1, 3, 5, . . . , 23 , 1

h = +1

h = 2

h = 2
h = 22

(1.1)

their local nature means that these charges are additive on asymptotic, multi-particle
states, and the fact that they commute means that single-particle states may be chosen

to be simultaneous eigenstates of them. their existence places strong constraints on the
possible three-point couplings, and their relationship with the underlying lie algebra in the

theory is crucial in ensuring that there is a consistent solution of the bootstrap equations
(see [2] and e.g. [3]) as was made clear in the elegant construction of dorey [4].

non-local charges have proved very important in understanding the classical and quan-
tum integrability of certain non-linear sigma-models [5, 6], amongst which are the princi-
pal chiral models (pcms) with target space some compact lie group. they also occur in

atfts with imaginary coupling, in connection with the soliton solutions in these theories.
in marked distinction to local charges, non-local charges are not additive on multi-particle

states and they can have either indenite or non-integral spin. the non-local charges gen-
erate a quantum group structure which underpins the factorizability of the s-matrix by

naturally providing solutions of the yang-baxter equation (see e.g. [7]). the quantum
group is a yangian [8] in the case of pcms, whereas it is a quantized ane algebra for

1

imaginary coupling atfts [9].

there are some very important physical dierences between the types of models we have

just mentioned.
in atfts the coupling constant is small at low energies, so that per-
turbation theory and semi-classical techniques can be used to determine the spectrum of
particles (including solitons for the imaginary coupling theories). one-loop calculations

conrm that mass ratios of particles are unchanged for the simply-laced algebras, while
they vary with the coupling constant for the nonsimply-laced cases (see e.g. [3, 2]). in com-

plete contrast, any sigma-model with a compact target manifoldin particular a pcmis
strongly-coupled in the infra-red, so that information about the quantum theory is much

harder to extract from the lagrangian. in fact the classical lagrangians for these theories
are scale-invariant, and masses arise through a complicated quantum-mechanical eect at
strong coupling.

despite the disparate properties of these eld theories and the very dierent roles played
by the local and non-local charges within them, it turns out that they still have much in

common at the quantum level, and in particular the patterns of masses and three-point
couplings coincide in a rather remarkable way. the mass ratios which emerge for pcms

(from their exact s-matrices [10, 11, 12]) are actually identical to those of the atfts [3, 2]
if one considers theories based on the same, simply-laced lie algebra. for nonsimply-laced

algebras there is a more subtle connection, in which the pcm mass ratios coincide with
those of tree-level atfts based on twisted ane algebras.

the three-point couplings in atfts are given by doreys rule, while the three-point

couplings in pcms arise as s-matrix fusions contained in the tensor product rule for rep-
resentations of the yangian (the analogue of the clebsch-gordan rule for lie algebras).

there is no reason to suppose a priori that these should be related, and yet it has recently
been proved [13] that the quantum group fusion rule for fundamental representations (de-

rived from the non-local charge algebra) and doreys rule (derived from local charges) are
one and the same. since the proof consists of a complicated case-by-case analysis, however,

it remains something of a mystery why this is so.

our aim in this paper is to study in detail the properties of certain local conserved charges
in the principal chiral models. their existence has been known for some time [14, 15], but

they have been somewhat neglected in pcms in favour of the non-local charges discussed
above. an obvious possibility is that the pcm local charges can oer a more transparent

explanation for the striking common features of pcms and atfts. another motivation

2

is that the detailed study of this particular model in which the local and non-local charges
co-exist may oer some insights into the way in which these entities are related in general.

the majority of the papersections 2, 3 and 4elucidates the classical properties of the
local charges appearing in pcms. there exists a conserved local charge for each invariant
tensor or casimir of the underlying lie algebra, and we shall prove that these always

commute with the non-local yangian charges. we then investigate in detail the poisson
bracket algebra of the local charges with one another. our main result is to nd for each

pcm an innite family of local charges which commute classically and which have spins
equal to the exponents (1.1) modulo the coxeter number, precisely as for the atfts.

because of the diculties inherent in quantizing the pcm, there is only a limited amount
which can be said about the quantum behaviour of these charges, which we summarize in
section 5. we can, nevertheless, examine the implications of their survival at the quantum

level, and we nd complete compatibility with the known multiplet structures and exact
s-matrices [10, 12].

2 the classical principal chiral model

2.1 the lagrangian, symmetries and currents

the principal chiral model (pcm) is dened by the lagrangian


2

l =

tr(cid:16)g1g(cid:17)

(2.1)

where the eld g(x) takes values in some compact lie group g and  is a dimensionless
coupling which may be set to any convenient value in the classical theory, without loss of
generality. there is a global continuous symmetry

with corresponding conserved currents

gl  gr :

g 7 ul g u 1

r

jl
 =  g g1,

jr
 =  g1g

(2.2)

(2.3)

which take values in the lie algebra g of g. the equations of motion following from (2.1)
correspond to the conservation of these currents:

j(x, t) = 0 .

3

(2.4)

they also obey

j  j 

1


[j, j] = 0

(2.5)

identically, as a consequence of their denitions in terms of the eld g. here and elsewhere
we will adopt the convention that any equation written for a current j without a label
holds true for both l and r currents. it is signicant that the last condition above can be

interpreted as a zero-curvature condition for a connection with covariant derivative

x = x 

1


[j, x]

(2.6)

acting on any x in g. here we view 1j as a two-dimensional gauge eld, its denition
in terms of g implying that it is pure-gauge. the two conditions (2.4, 2.5) capture the
entire algebraic structure of the pcm.

we shall restrict attention to the classical groups g = su(), so(), sp() (with  even
in the last case) with the eld g(x) in the dening representation. the corresponding lie
algebra g then consists of  complex matrices x which obey

su() :

so() :

sp() :

x  = x, tr(x) = 0
x t = x
x  = x,
x  = x, x t = jxj 1

(2.7)

where j is some chosen symplectic structure. in each case we introduce a basis of anti-
hermitian generators ta for g with real structure constants f abc and normalizations given
by

[ta, tb] = f abctc ,

tr(tatb) = ab .

(2.8)

(lie algebra indices will always be taken from the beginning of the alphabet.) for any
x  g we write

(2.9)

x = tax a

x a = tr(tax) .

spacetime symmetries will also play an important role in what follows. the classical

pcm lagrangian is conformally-invariant, and as a result the energy momentum tensor

t = 

1

2 (cid:18) tr(jj) 

1
2

tr(jj)(cid:19)

(2.10)

is not only conserved and symmetric but also traceless. we shall use standard orthonormal
coordinates x0 = t and x1 = x in two dimensions, as well as light-cone coordinates and
their derivatives dened by

x =

1
2

(t  x) ,

 = t  x .

4

the equations (2.4, 2.5) can then be written

j+ = +j = 

1
2

[j+, j] ,

whilst the energy-momentum tensor takes the familiar form

with

t = 

1
2

tr(jj) ,

t+ = t+ = 0 ,

t++ = +t = 0 .

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

in addition to the continuous symmetries comprising gl and gr, there are also important

discrete symmetries of the principal chiral model. for any pcm there is a symmetry

 : g 7 g1



jl  jr

(2.14)

which exchanges gl and gr and which we shall therefore refer to as g-parity. (in the
pcm eective eld theory description of strong interactions in four dimensions, the phys-
ical parity operator is our g-parity together with spatial reection.) additional discrete
symmetries arise as outer automorphisms of g acting on the the eld g. thus we have

 : g 7 g



jl 7 (jl) = (jl)t ,

jr 7 (jr) = (jr)t ,

(2.15)

which exchanges complex-conjugate representations. this realizes the outer automorphism
of g = su(). the map is trivial (up to conjugation) if g has only real (or pseudo-real)

representations. for g = so(2) we also have

 : g 7 mgm 1



jl 7 mjlm 1 ,

jr 7 mjrm 1 ,

where m is a xed matrix with determinant 1. this is the outer automorphism which
exchanges the inequivalent spinor representations. the maps  and  coincide (up to
conjugation) for g = so(2) when  is odd.

2.2 canonical formalism

the canonical poisson brackets for the theory are

nja
0 (x), jb
nja
0 (x), jb
nja
1 (x), jb

0(y)o = f abc jc
1(y)o = f abc jc
1(y)o = 0

0(x) (xy)
1(x) (xy) +  ab (xy)

5

(2.16)

at equal time. these expressions hold for either of the currents jl or jr separately, while
the algebra of jl with jr involves only (xy) terms in the brackets of space- with time-
components [16] (we shall not need them here) in keeping with the direct product structure
of gl  gr. for light-cone current components these brackets become

nja
(x), jb
nja
+(x), jb

(y)o = f abc( 3
2jc
2 jc
(x) ) (xy)  2 ab (xy)
(x)  1
(y)o = 1
2f abc( jc
+(x) + jc
(x) ) (xy)

(2.17)

they imply that the energy momentum tensor satises the classical, centre-less virasoro
algebra

{t(x), t(y)} = 2( t(x) + t(y) ) (xy) .

(2.18)

there are a number of ways to derive the expressions (2.16). one approach [16] has the
advantage of dealing directly with the currents rather than with the underlying eld g:
we can select j1 as the only independent dynamical variable, since we can regard j0 as a
function of it which is determined through the relation (2.5). the price to be paid is the
introduction of an operator 1
1 which is non-local in space and whose denition assumes
suitable boundary conditions for the currents at spatial innity. this enables us to write
j0 = 1

1 (0j1) and so write the lagrangian as (we set  = 1 here for simplicity)

l = 

tr(j2

0  j2

1) = 

1
2

1
2

trh (1

1i
1 0j1)2  j2

the momentum conjugate to j1 is dened in the usual way: 1 = l/(0j1) = 2
1 0j1
and we deduce that j0 = 11. (this requires the property 1
1 (b) up
to terms which vanish on integrating over space, so again the adoption of suitable boundary
conditions on the elds is crucial.) the expressions (2.16) can now be recovered from the
standard equal-time poisson brackets for j1 and 1 after a short calculation. a lengthier
but more routine derivation which avoids the use of the operator 1
can be found in an
appendix.

3 classical conserved charges

3.1 non-local charges

there exist innitely many conserved, lie algebra-valued, non-local charges in the pcm,
which generate a yangian y (g) [18]. in fact there are two copies of this structure, con-
structed either from jl
 , and so the model has a charge algebra yl(g)  yr(g). (it

 or jr

6

can be checked that yl and yr commute.) a full set of non-local charges q(n)a with
n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , can be generated from the obvious local charge

q(0)a = z 



ja
0 dx

and the rst non-local charge

q(1)a = z 



ja
1 dx

2

f abcz 



jb

0(x)z x



(3.1)

(3.2)

jc
0(y) dy dx .

this set can also be dened by a power series expansion of the transfer matrix in its spectral

parameter, or equivalently they can be constructed by the following iterative procedure [6].

suppose we have lie algebra-valued currents j(r)

 dened for r = 0, 1, . . . , n which are

conserved:

j(r)

+ + +j(r)

 = 0  j(r)

 = (r)

(3.3)

for some scalar lie algebra-valued functions (r), and that these currents are related to one
another by

j(r+1)


= (r) = (r)  1[j, (r)] .

(3.4)

taking r = n denes a new current, j(n+1)



j(n+1)

+

+ +j(n+1)



which is conserved because
= (+ + +)(n)
= (+ + +)(n)
= +j(n)
 + j(n)
= [+,](n1)
= 0

+

for n  1. thus, starting from j(0)
0(x)z x
j(1)a

(x) = ja

we can dene an innite set of currents which are non-local functions of the original elds

for n > 0; their conserved charges are q(n)a = r j(n)a
we obtain nm, q(0)ao = nm, q(1)ao = 0. (the second of these equations is modied in

classically, the non-local charges are lorentz scalars: applying the boost operator m

the quantum theory, howeversee below.) because the charges are non-local they will not
generally be additive on products of states. their action is given by the coproduct:

dx.

0

(cid:16)q(0)a(cid:17) = q(0)a  1 + 1  q(0)a
and (cid:16)q(1)a(cid:17) = q(1)a  1 + 1  q(1)a +

1
2

7

f abcq(0)b  q(0)c

,

(3.5)

which we see is non-trivial in the second case. as well as the usual interpretation in the
quantum theory, these equations may also be interpreted classically as giving the values of
the charges on widely-separated, localized eld congurations [5].

3.2 local charges

in any conformally-invariant theory, the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor
(2.13) immediately implies a series of higher-spin conservation laws:

(t n

++) = +(t n

) = 0 .

(3.6)

but the pcm has more basic conservation laws which depend on the detailed form of
the equations of motion of the currents rather than on conformal invariance alone. the

simplest examples are

tr(jm

+ ) = +tr(jm

 ) = 0

(3.7)

which follow easily from (2.11). more generally, we may consider any rank-m, totally
symmetric, invariant tensor da1a2...am associated with a casimir operator

cm = da1a2...amta1ta2 . . . tam

where

[cm, tb] = 0



dc(a1a2...am1fam)bc = 0

(3.8)

(3.9)

(and as usual (. . .) denotes symmetrization of the enclosed indices). it is then easy to check

that invariance of d ensures the conservation equations

( da1a2...amja1

 ja2

 . . . jam

 ) = 0 .

the corresponding conserved charges will be denoted

qs = z 



da1a2...am ja1

 (x)ja2

 (x) . . . jam

 (x) dx

(3.10)

(3.11)

and labelled by their spin s = m1 (the poisson bracket with the boost generator m is
{m, qs} = sqs). we shall refer to charges qs with s > 0 as having positive/negative
chirality.

invariance of the d-tensor implies that the same local conservation laws are obtained
using either of the currents jl or jr, so there is just a single copy of these local charges,
unlike the two-fold l and r copies of the non-local charges. also in contrast to the non-local

8

charges, we note that any local charge must be additive on multi-particle states, which we
can also express by saying that such a charge has a trivial co-product: (qs) = qs1+1qs.
the currents in (3.6) correspond to even-rank invariant tensors constructed from kro-

necker deltas:

da1a2...a2n1a2n = (a1a2a3a4. . . a2n1a2n)

while those in (3.7) correspond to

da1a2...am = str(ta1ta2. . . tam)

(3.12)

(3.13)

with str denoting the trace of a completely symmetrized product of matrices. for su()
this tensor is non-vanishing for each integer m, but for so() or sp() it is non-zero only

when m is even. it is useful to introduce the notation

jm = tr(jm
+ )

(3.14)

for the corresponding currents. notice that j2 is proportional to the energy-momentum
tensor t++, so that the currents in (3.6) can also be written (j2)n.

there are innitely many invariant tensors da1...am for each algebra g, but there are only
rank(g) independent or primitive d-tensors and casimirs (see e.g. [19]) with degrees equal
to the exponents of g plus one. all other invariant tensors can be expressed as polynomials
in these and the structure constants fabc. the choice of these rank(g) primitive tensors is
not unique, the ambiguity being the addition of polynomials in tensors of lower rank. the
symmetrized traces in (3.13) are a particular choice for all the primitive d-tensors of the

classical algebras, with one exception. this exception is the pfaan invariant in so(2),
which has rank  and can be written

da1...a = i1j1...ij(ta1)i1j1 . . . (ta)ij .

(3.15)

this tensor cannot be expressed as a trace in the dening representation, although it is
related to a trace in the spinor representation. we denote the corresponding current by

p = i1j1...ij(j+)i1j1 . . . (j+)ij .

(3.16)

finally, we should mention that there are innitely many more conserved currents in
the pcm which arise as dierential polynomials in those already discussed. for exam-

ple, (cid:16)tr(jp

+tr(jq

+)(cid:17) = 0 follows immediately from (3.7). we shall not be directly

9

3.3 commutation of local with non-local charges

we will now show that all local charges of the general type (3.11) commute with the
non-local charges generated by q(0)a and q(1)a. this means showing that

{ qs, q(0)b } = { qs, q(1)b } = 0 .

(3.17)

the vanishing of the rst bracket follows immediately from invariance of the d-tensor used
to dene qs; this says simply that the charge qs is a singlet under the lie algebra. the
calculation of the second bracket is more delicate, and involves a cancellation between
contributions originating from ultralocal and non-ultralocal terms.

consider the expression (3.2) for q(1)b, which involves two terms. the bracket of qs with

the rst (local) term is

{ qs,z dy jb

1(y) } = da1a2...amz z dx dy { ja1

+ (x) . . . jam

+ (x), jb

1(y) }
(x)jd

= m da1a2...am1cf bcdz dx ja1

+ (x) . . . jam1

+

1 (x) .

(3.18)

we have used the fact that da1...am is totally symmetric and also the boundary conditions
j  0 as x   which imply that there is no contribution from  terms in the current
poisson bracket. to deal with the second (non-local) term in (3.2) we must handle carefully
the limits of the spatial integration: we take these to be l and only afterwards let l  .
we must calculate

{ qs ,z l

4 classical algebra of local charges

in this section we discuss in detail the classical poisson bracket algebra of local charges
qs of the type (3.11). in calculating these from (2.17) one nds that the terms involving
(xy) (i.e. the ultra-local terms) always vanish by invariance of the d-tensors, leaving
just the contributions from the (xy) terms. it is clear from (2.17) that these too are
absent if we are considering charges of opposite chirality, so that

for charges of the same chirality, however, the result is generally non-zero:

{qs, qr} = 0 ,

r, s > 0.

{qs, qr} = (const)z 



dx dca1...asdcb1...br ja1

+ . . . jas

+ x(jb1

+ . . . jbr

+ ) .

(4.1)

(4.2)

note that the expression on the right is antisymmetric in s and r, by integration by parts.

before proceeding we must pause to prove our assertion that the ultra-local terms do not
contribute to (4.1) and (4.2). in (4.1) the ultra-local terms produce an integrand which is

a combination of

da1...asa db1...brb ja1

+ . . . jas

+ jb1

 . . . jbr

 f abcjc



with all elds at the same spacetime argument. these expressions vanish by invariance
(3.9) of one or other of the d-tensors involved. in (4.2) the ultra-local terms contribute

integrands

da1...asa db1...brb ja1

+ . . . jas

+ jb1

+ . . . jbr

+ f abcjc

 .

the expression with jc
+ vanishes by invariance of either tensor, while the expression with
jc
 can be rearranged using invariance of the second tensor to yield a result proportional
to

da1...asa db1...brb ja1

+ . . . jas

+ jb1

+ . . . jbr

 f abcjc
+

11

and this vanishes by invariance of the rst tensor. this justies our assertions.

our aim is to nd invariant tensors and conserved currents for which the expression
(4.2) vanishes, so that the charges commute. in the special case r = 1 and dbc = bc, the
integrand in (4.2) is clearly a total derivative and hence the poisson bracket is zero. this
simply means that all the local charges (3.11) commute with energy and momentum: they

are invariant under translations in space and time. it is also easy to see that the integrand
in (4.2) can be written as a total derivative if both currents are of the form (3.6). this is

a feature of any classically conformally-invariant theory whose energy-momentum tensor
obeys the virasoro algebra (2.18).
it is a simple consequence of this that the charges

r (t++)ndx all commute. finding more interesting sets of commuting charges with s, r > 1

in the pcm is rather more involved, as we shall see.

4.1 algebra of charges for currents jm

the natural currents to consider rst are jm dened by (3.14), in which case (4.2) can be
written

+) .

(4.3)

to simplify this we will use the completeness condition x = ta tr(tax), which is valid
for any x in the lie algebra g. this can be applied directly to the integrand in (4.3) if
we know that a given power jr
+ lives in g for any j+ in g. whenever this is true, the
completeness condition implies that the integrand is proportional to xtr(jr+s
+ ) and hence
the charges commute.

+ or js

this argument applies to the orthogonal and symplectic algebras so() and sp(), so

that in these pcms the charges r jmdx always commute. to elaborate on this, consider

the orthogonal case. if x is in so() it is a real anti-symmetric matrix, and if r is odd,
x r will also be real and anti-symmetric, and hence also in so(). this implies rstly that
jr+1 is zero unless r is odd, and secondly that under these circumstances we can apply the
completeness condition to write the integrand in (4.3) as a total derivative, proportional to
x(jr+s). for the symplectic algebras it is easy to see that that if x satises the dening
conditions (2.7) then so does x r if r is odd, so the argument works in precisely the same
way.

although we are concerned in this paper with pcms based on simple, compact classical

groups, it is worth mentioning in passing the non-simple case g = u(). if x is in u(),

12

then so is x r if r is odd, or ix r if r is even. either way, the argument applies in just

the same way and the charges r js+1dx commute.5 for g = su() the situation is more

in this case the completeness condition holds only for traceless

complicated, however.

matrices x and this property is of course spoiled by taking powers. we can still use the
completeness condition, but we must do so in a less direct way. since the generators tc in
(4.3) are traceless, we can rst replace jr

then apply the completeness condition to nd

(4.4)

this is certainly non-zero in general, and so for su() the charges r jm dx do not com-
mute. notice that the non-vanishing bracket is nevertheless a conserved quantity that we
recognize, namely a dierential polynomial in the currents jm.

4.2 commuting charges for the su() model

it is natural to ask whether we can nd more complicated functions of the quantities jm
which will yield commuting charges for the su() theory. to investigate this we need to

know the exact form of their poisson brackets. it is convenient to set  = 1/2, which we
assume henceforth. from (2.16), and making appropriate use of the completeness condition

as above, we nd:

mn
 jm1(x) jn1(x) (xy)
mn
 jm1(x) j 
n1(x) (xy)

(4.5)

{jm(x),jn(y)} = mnjm+n2(x) (xy) +
m+n2(x) (xy) +

mn(n1)
n+m2 j 



we can use these results to search systematically for conserved currents ks+1(jm) of ho-
mogeneous spin which will give commuting charges. after some laborious calculations we
nd the following expressions for the rst few values of the spin:

k2 = j2
k3 = j3
k4 = j4 
k5 = j5 
k6 = j6

(4.6)

5the same argument also applies to the case g = gl() [21], although this is perhaps of less direct

physical interest since the algebra is non-compact.

13

these are the unique combinations (up to overall constants) for which the corresponding
charges commute.

we can extrapolate from these examples to a general formula. to construct a charge
of spin s we must dene a current of spin s+1.
in the lie algebra su() there is (up
to an overall constant) a unique polynomial in the currents j2,j3, . . . ,j,j+1 which is
homogeneous of spin +1 and which vanishes; we write this

a+1( j2,j3, . . . ,j,j+1 ) = 0

in su() .

from this we dene a current of spin s+1 for g = su(), by the formula

ks+1( jm ) = as+1( sjm )

where

 =

h

.

(4.7)

(4.8)

it is easily checked that (4.8) reproduces the rst ve examples listed in (4.6) for any value

of .

we will prove below that the charges r ks+1 dx always commute. another important

fact about the formula (4.8) is that when s =  the current vanishes, by construction. in
fact this also happens whenever s is a multiple of , which we shall also prove below. thus,

we claim that the formula denes a series of currents whose charges can have spin s equal
to any integer which is non-zero mod h = . to prove these claims, we need to develop

some technology.

following [17] we consider the generating functions a(x, ) and f (x, ) dened by

which implies

a(x, ) = exp f (x, ) = det(1  j+(x))

f (x, ) = tr log(1  j+(x)) = 

r
r jr(x) .



xr=2

(4.9)

(4.10)

observe that a(x, ) is a polynomial in  of degree , with the coecient of the highest
power being (1)det(j+). on substituting the series expansion for f (x, ) into (4.9), we
obtain non-trivial identities satised by the jm as the coecients of r must vanish for
r >  (for details, see e.g. [20]). in particular, the polynomial a+1 introduced above is
the coecient of +1. our denition (4.8) can now be re-written

ks+1 = a(x, )s/h (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s+1 = exp

s

f (x, ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s+1 = exp

if s/h is not an integer, however, then a(x, )s/h will be
current ks+1 then vanishes.
a power series in  with innitely many terms, each with a non-vanishing coecient in

general. this shows that the conserved currents and their charges exist precisely when the
spin s is non-zero mod h = .

finally we are in a position to prove that the charges we have dened commute. this
is done by rst calculating the poisson brackets for the generating functions and then

extracting the desired charges as the coecients of particular terms:

{qs, qr} = z dxz dy {a(x, )s/h, a(y, )r/h} (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s+1 r+1 .

in the equations that follow, we will suppress the arguments of elds only when there is

(4.12)

no possible ambiguity.

from (4.5) it can be shown (after some eort) that

{f (x, ), f (y, )} = 22" f (x, )f (x, )

to nd the brackets of charges of spins s and r we must extract the terms of degree s+1

in  and r+1 in  from this expression. provided one is restricting to just these powers,
this means that in the formula above we can replace   s and   r. the result is

{qs, qr} = z dxz dy {a(x, )p, a(y, )q} (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s+1r+1

the integrand indeed vanishes when p = s/h and q = r/h, implying that the charges
commute as claimed.

4.3 more commuting charges for so() and sp()

a similar approach allows us to construct more general sets of commuting charges for
pcms based on other classical lie groups. for the orthogonal and symplectic algebras the
poisson brackets of the currents jm are somewhat simpler (we again set  = 1/2):

{jm(x),jn(y)} = mnjm+n2(x) (xy) 

mn(n1)
m+n2 j 

m+n2(x) (xy)

(4.16)

using these we can again search systematically for polynomials ks+1(jm) which produce
commuting charges, at least for some low-lying values of the spin. this reveals a family

of currents similar to (4.6), except this time there is a single free parameter  which is
allowed to take an arbitrary value. the rst few examples are:

k2 = j2
k4 = j4 
k6 = j6 
k8 = j8

(4.17)

the polynomials appearing above actually coincide with those of the same degree in (4.6)
if one replaces   1/, and if one also takes into account the fact that jm is non-zero for

16

the orthogonal and symplectic algebras only if m is even. this immediately suggests the
analogous general denition

ks+1( jm ) = as+1( sjm )

(4.18)

once again, it can be shown that the resulting charges r ks+1 dx always commute, this

time for any value of the parameter . notice that this new one-parameter family of
currents interpolates the two simplest families we found previously for the orthogonal and
symplectic algebras. when   0 we have k2m  j2m and in the limit    we have
(with a suitable rescaling) k2m  (j2)m.

to prove that these new currents give commuting charges we again use generating func-
tions. since jm is now non-zero only for m even, it is convenient to introduce two modied
generating functions

where

and

b(x, ) = exp g(x, )

b(x, ) = a(x,) = det(1

and to express the poisson brackets in terms of these. the general denition of the currents

for the orthogonal and symplectic algebras can then be written

and we wish to show that

ks+1 = b(x, )s |(s+1)/2

{qs, qr} = z dxz dy {b(x, )s, b(y, )r} |(s+1)/2 (r+1)/2

vanishes.

4.4 the pfaan charge and its generalizations

we have shown that any pcm based on a classical algebra has innitely many commuting
local charges constructed from combinations of invariant tensors of type (3.13). moreover,

these charges come in sequences, each associated with an exponent of the algebra, or a
primitive invariant tensor, and with the spins in each sequence equal to this exponent

modulo the coxeter number, h. but there is one primitive invariant tensor which is not of
the type (3.13) and which has therefore been absent from our discussion so farthis is the

pfaan (3.15) with its associated current (3.16). it is natural to expect that our results
can be extended so as to include this last invariant; we now show how this can be done.

7 as with the su() case, the corresponding formula in [17], eqn. (4.22), seems to contain a misprint; it

is not antisymmetric under the interchange x  y and   .

18

we rst investigate the behaviour of the pfaan charge in so(2), with current p, with
respect to the other local charges which we have constructed for this algebra, with currents
given in (4.22). the relevant poisson brackets are:

{p(x),j2m(y)} = mp(x) j2m2 (xy)  m
{p(x),j2(y)} = 2 p(x) (xy)  2p 
a derivation of these is described in an appendix. by calculating the brackets directly,

2m2(x) (xy)

(m 6= 2)
(4.28)

2m1
2m2 p(x) j 

(x) (xy) .

we nd that for the rst few examples listed in (4.17), the charges r kmdx commute with
the pfaan charge r pdx provided we choose  = 1/h, where h = 22 is the coxeter

number of so(2). by considering the bracket of the pfaan current with the generating
function b(x, ), this can be extended to a proof of commutation of the pfaan charge

with all the charges r kmdx dened by (4.17). we omit the details, however, in favour of

a more complete treatment from an alternative point of view, as follows.

we are concerned not just with the pfaan current but also with nding generalizations
p+ah for all integers a  0 (where the subscript denotes the spin, as usual). in other words,
we expect it to be just the rst member of a sequence of conserved quantities whose spins

repeat modulo the coxeter number. it is far from clear a priori how these generalizations
should be dened, but the answer is, rather remarkably, already contained in the generating

functions we have been considering. we have shown how to use the generating functions
to dene the currents km as coecients in an expansion in ascending powers of . it turns
out that the pfaan and its generalizations naturally emerge from a similar expansion in
descending powers of . the formula is then exactly the one already given in (4.22) but

with  = 1/h:

p+ah = b(x, )(a+1/2)|a(1)+/2

a = 0, 1, 2, . . .

.

(4.29)

the choice  = 1/h is made so that we recover the pfaan current when a = 0.

to illustrate how this works it is best to consider the simplest possible example: g =

so(6) with  = 3 and h = 4 in the discussion above. now

b(x, ) = exp g(x, ) = det(1 

j+) = 1 + q2 + 2q4 + 3p 2

3

where for convenience we have dened

q2 = 

1
2 j2

and

q4 =

4

( j4

2j 2

2 ) .

and then expand the bracket to any desired order using the binomial theorem. this gives
the following results (up to overall constants) for the rst few generalizations of the pfaan

charge:

p11 = p3 q2

(4.33)

since so(6) = su(4) we can compare these results with the non-trivial odd-spin currents

predicted by (4.11). taking due account of normalizations arising from the inequivalence
of the dening representations, we nd exact agreement (details are given in an appendix).

returning now to the general case, we re-iterate the important point that our denitions
of the currents km and pm are both given by the equation (4.22), but with the understand-
ing that the expansions are carried out in ascending and descending powers respectively.
our proof that (4.22) led to commuting charges did not involve any explicit expansion
in the parameter ; the information about the power of  to be extracted was used only
to replace the homogeneous dierential operators  and  by appropriate integers.
consequently, our arguments apply equally well if one or both of the charges considered

is of pfaan type. thus they ensure that the sets r kmdx and r pmdx all commute with

one another when  = 1/h.

finally, it is natural to ask whether new charges could be constructed for the other
classical series a, b and c by considering expansions in descending powers in a similar
way. if we expand a(x, )s/h in descending powers, it is not dicult to see that there is a
term of order s+1 only if the degree of a(x, ) as a polynomial in  exceeds the coxeter
number h. for the algebras a, b and c the degree of a(x, ) is less than or equal to the
coxeter number, so that no non-trivial charges can be dened in this way. the special
feature of d in this respect is that a(x, ) is of degree 2 which exceeds h = 22, so the
construction of charges through an expansion in descending powers works only in this case.

5 comments on the quantum pcm

it would be very interesting to know whether the classical charges we have discussed are
still conserved in the quantum theory, and whether or not the classical poisson brackets

we have shown to vanish receive corrections when they are elevated to quantum commu-
tators. unfortunately the subtle relationship between the classical pcm lagrangian and
its corresponding quantum theory makes these questions extremely dicult to tackle. in

this section we give a brief summary of some relevant facts about the quantum pcm and
explain how these t together with our classical results.

the non-local charges are conserved in the quantum theory. their behaviour has been
studied [8, 5] using a point-splitting regularization of q(1)a and they were found to obey
a quantum version of the classical yangian symmetry yl(g)  yr(g). an important novel
feature is that the poisson bracket of the lorentz boost generator with q(1), which vanishes
classically, develops a term at order h2. this is essential to the construction of the quantum
s-matrices, which would otherwise be trivial. point-splitting regularization would be a
very much more complicated procedure for the local charges, since they involve products

of many currents taken at a single point. another approach which is likely to be rather
cumbersome would be to regularize the model on a lattice. to our knowledge, neither of

these approaches has been developed to study the quantum behaviour of the local charges.
in the absence of a tractable explicit quantization procedure, the only information comes
from less direct arguments.8

5.1 goldschmidt-witten anomaly counting

in the method of goldschmidt and witten [14, 22] (see also [15]) one considers all possible
quantum anomaly terms which might spoil a classical conservation equation j = 0.
the form of this equation reects the classical conformal invariance of the theory. one

cannot expect it to survive unscathed in the quantum theory, where conformal invariance
is broken, but if the right-hand side gets a quantum correction which can be written as

a derivative, then we will still have a conserved quantity, albeit of a modied form. the
argument is reminiscent of zamolodchikovs approach [23] to perturbed conformal eld

8 although the calculations have not been carried out, it would be surprising if the vanishing commu-
tators between the non-local and local charges received quantum modications, since it is dicult to see
how the known s-matrices could be consistent if the local charges did not commute with the yangian.

21

theory, though it pre-dates it.

to be more precise, suppose we have linearly-independent conservation equations of
the form ji = 0 with i = 1, . . . , n which have a certain prescribed behaviour under all
global symmetries of the theory. the only quantum modications which can appear on the
right-hand side are operators with the same mass dimension and the same behaviour under
continuous and discrete symmetries. let ai with i = 1, . . . , p, be a linearly-independent set
of such operators. we can also enumerate the linearly-independent total-derivative terms
bi with i = 1, . . . , q, which again have the same behaviour under all symmetries.9 since
each of the bs is expressible as a combination of as, we have q  p. now if n  p + q > 0,
then there are at least this many combinations of the classical conservation equations
which survive in the quantum theory, because this is the number of linearly-independent
combinations for which the right-hand side is guaranteed to be a spacetime divergence.

goldschmidt and witten wrote down lists of as and bs for conserved quantities in the
pcms as functions of the eld g. we have found it much more convenient to use the lie
algebra-valued currents j, particularly in settling the all-important question of which as
and bs are independent. we shall use only the l currents for deniteness, dropping the

label l henceforth. it is important to keep careful track of the behaviour of these currents
and their derivatives under the discrete symmetries of the pcm. from (2.14) we see that
under g-parity  : j+ 7 g1j+g and j++  +j+ 7 g1 j++ g, but the situation is
more complicated for higher derivatives. to overcome this we introduce quantities

(5.3)

note that for so(2) all the currents are even under  except for the spin- pfaan current,

which is odd.

9 in deciding which as are independent, we are free to use the classical equations of motion, because
any quantum modications appearing in the heisenberg equations will correspond to operators with the
correct dimensions and invariance properties to ensure that they will already occur in our list. similarly,
in counting the bs, as explained in [14].

22

the rst example of a conserved current is j2 = tr(j2

+), the energy-momentum tensor,
which we certainly expect to survive quantization.
indeed, there is only one possible
anomaly a1 =tr(jj++), only one derivative b1 = +tr(jj+), and in fact a1 = b1.
this modication of the original conservation law reects the non-vanishing of the trace
of the energy-momentum tensor quantum mechanically, corresponding to the breaking of
conformal symmetry. the next example is j3 = tr(j3
+), which is non-trivial only for
su(). this current is odd under both  and . here again there is one anomaly, a1 =
tr(j++{j, j+}), and one derivative b1 = +tr(jj2
+), with a1 = b1; the conservation
again survives quantization.

the case of currents with spin 4 is the most interesting. there are two classical conserved
+))2. these are even under each of the discrete

2 = (tr(j2

currents, j4 = tr(j4

b1 = +tr(jj+++)

b2 = +(cid:16)tr(jj+)tr(j2

b3 = +tr(jj3
+)

b4 = tr(j2

++)

(note that another apparent possibility among the bs, tr(j+j+++), is not allowed; it is
not independent of b3.) all other possibilities are disallowed: for su() these terms are
odd under , while for other groups the traces vanish. thus in all cases we have p = 5,
q = 4 but the number of classical currents is n = 2. we conclude that there is at least one
linear combination of tr(j4

+))2 which will survive quantization.10

+) and (tr(j2

there is only one other instance in which the counting arguments are known to ensure
a quantum conservation law. it was shown in [14] that conservation of the pfaan current

in so(2) always generalizes to the quantum theory; we shall not reproduce the details
here. for all other currents which we have investigated the goldschmidt-witten method

10 we have reached the same conclusions as [14] regarding the existence of spin-3 and spin-4 currents.
in comparing our lists of anomalies and derivatives with theirs, however, we should point out some dis-
crepancies. there seem to be misprints and/or errors in eqns. (19) and (23) of [14]: the terms a4 in (19)
and a2 in (23) do not have the correct behaviour under discrete symmetries. furthermore, the terms b1
and b2 in eqn. (24) of [14] are not independent, since they can be related using the equations of motion.
any obvious modication of the term a2 in eqn. (23) to give it the correct symmetry can similarly be
related to a1, conrming our counting above of one anomaly and one derivative for the spin-3 current,
rather than two of each, as claimed in [14]. this underscores our opinion that it is clearest to work with
quantities valued in the lie algebra  i.e. currents j rather than the eld g.

is inconclusive.11 we should emphasize however that these counting criteria, although
sometimes sucient to show quantum conservation, are never necessary. the fact that
the counting fails should certainly not be interpreted as meaning that there is no quantum

version of a given classical conservation law, but rather that these simple arguments are
insucient to settle the issue either way. moreover, we have seen that the arguments

guarantee the existence of at least one higher-spin conserved charge in each pcm, which
is believed to be sucient for integrability and factorization of the s-matrix [30].

note also that the counting arguments, when successful, give no information about
which combinations of the classical currents might survive. from our earlier work on the
classical poisson brackets of these charges, we have found for the a and d series that there
were unique preferred sets of charges which all commute with one another. it is natural
to anticipate that these are the combinations which generalize to the quantum theory.
for the b and c series, however, such charges are not unique and we have no means of
discriminating amongst the possibilities.

5.2 s-matrices, particle multiplets and discrete symmetries

in the exact s-matrix approach to the pcms, the particle states are assumed to lie in
representations (v, v ) of the global symmetry group gl  gr [12, 10]. the representation
v of g always contains an irreducible component vi which is one of the fundamental
representations (associated to a node i of the dynkin diagram) of g. for the a and c
series the representations are exactly v = vi, but for the b and d algebras v may be
reducible in general.
it is actually more natural to regard v as acted on by the entire
yangian y (g), with (v, v ) a representation of yl  yr; then v is precisely one of the
fundamental representations of the yangian y (g) [10, 25, 26]. based on this assignment of
representations, the full s-matrices have been determined for the a and c pcms, while
for the b and d models the scattering amongst the vector and spinor particles has been
found (as well as some amplitudes involving second-rank tensor particlesin principle all

other amplitudes are determined by the bootstrap procedure, but these have not been
calculated).

the action of charge conjugation on yl  yr representations is  : (v, w ) 7 ( v , w ),

11 for spin-5 currents in the su () pcm which are odd under  and  we nd n = 2, p = 8 and q = 6.
for spin-6 currents which are even under  and  we nd n = 5, p = 25, q = 18, for su (), and n = 4,
p = 23, q = 17 for so() or sp().

24

while the eect of g-parity is to exchange gl and gr, so that  : (v, w ) 7 (w, v ). both
discrete symmetries map a particle multiplet (v, v ) to itself if v = v . but if v 6= v then
an implication of either symmetry is that mass-degenerate yangian representations (v, v )
and ( v , v ) must appear together in the spectrum, as proposed in [10].

we have shown that the local charges commute with the yangian classically. we will

now assume that the same holds in the quantum theory, so that each local charge takes
a constant value on a particle multiplet (v, v ). we want to show how this is compatible
with the assignment of representations and the eects of the discrete symmetries. recall
in particular that g-parity leaves invariant, or commutes with, a local charge whose spin s
is an odd integer, but reverses the value of, or anticommutes with, a local charge for which
s is an even integer.

the algebras b, c and d2 have only real representations, v = v . a related fact is that
the exponents are always odd integers, and so the associated local charges commute with
g-parity. this is certainly consistent with the representation content v  v , which is the
simplest kind of multiplet whose states can be g-parity singlets.

for the algebras a and d2+1, however, there is always one exponent which is an even
integer, and hence at least one local charge q which anti-commutes with g-parity. the
only way to have a simultaneous eigenstate of q and  is for the eigenvalue of q to vanish,

and so on particle multiplets of the form (v, v ) we must have q = 0. conversely, yangian
representations on which q 6= 0 must appear in g-parity pairs. the fact that the algebra
has an even exponent is linked to the occurrence of complex representations, v 6= v , and
the multiplets (v, v ) and ( v , v ) can indeed be organized into g-parity doublets provided
they are eigenspaces of q with opposite eigenvalues. precisely the same phenomenon occurs

in atfts, where it is the even-spin charges which enable states to be distinguished from
their mass-degenerate conjugates [2].

to complete the discussion, we consider the special case d = so(2) and the additional
discrete symmetry  which exchanges the spinor representations s. the representations
s are real for  even and complex for  odd. for  even the pfaan charge commutes with
, but anti-commutes with . the particle multiplets are (s+, s+) and (s, s) which
are eigenstates of , but these representations are exchanged by , so its eigenstates lie in
(s+, s+)  (s, s). for  odd, the pfaan charge anti-commutes with both  and .
now the particle multiplets are (s+, s) and (s, s+), and the eigenstates of both  and
 lie in (s+, s)  (s, s+).

25

5.3 doreys rule

the occurrence in ane toda theories (atfts) of local conserved charges with spins equal

to the exponents of the underlying lie algebra modulo the coxeter number leads to the
elegant rule for particle fusings discovered by dorey [4]. in atfts these particle fusings

appear both in the tree-level three-point couplings (which can be found easily from the clas-
sical lagrangian) and also in the exact s-matrices. for pcms the corresponding three-point

fusings are dened solely by the s-matrices with their yangian symmetry. nevertheless, it
has been proved [13], by exploiting the technology of yangian representations in a highly
non-trivial fashion, that doreys rule applies to pcm particle fusings too.

we have constructed a set of local conserved charges in each classical pcm with exactly
the same patterns of spins as those appearing in atfts. we are not at present able to prove

that these all survive quantization (though some certainly do), but this fact would provide
a very natural explanation of the validity of doreys rule for pcm s-matrices, at least

for the simply-laced algebras. for the non-simply-laced cases there are some additional
subtleties, which we now briey discuss.

and d(2)

the non-simply-laced atfts appear in dual pairs, typically involving an untwisted and
a twisted algebra. let us consider the example of the pair of algebras c(1)
+1. the

charges have spins equal to the exponents of c, but their values depend on the coupling
constant: in the weak-coupling limit they have the c(1)
tree-level values, while in the strong-

coupling limit they are associated in a similar way with d(2)
+1. doreys construction does
not allow for a coupling constant dependence in the values of the local charges, and gives
the tree-level couplings either for c, the set of which we shall call d(c), or (when suitably
generalized [27]) for d(2)
+1). it is then the intersection of the two
sets, d(c)  d(c)  d(d(2)
+1), which gives the correct fusings for the bootstrap principle
applied to the quantum atft s-matrices.

+1, which we shall call d(d(2)

the c pcm s-matrices [28] also have d(c) fusings. but in the quantum pcm there is
no coupling constant dependence: the classical coupling is replaced by the overall quantum
mass-scale (dimensional transmutation). the c pcm mass ratios are actually those of the
tree-level d(2)
+1 atft, whilst the values of the other conserved charges must similarly be
xed, with no coupling-dependence. the outstanding issue is whether it is the values taken
by these local charges which are sucient to restrict the pcm fusings to d(c) (rather
than, say, d(d(2)

+1)), or whether some more subtle restriction is taking place.

26

6 summary and conclusions

we have carried out a rather thorough investigation of local charges in principal chiral
models. we have shown that any local charge constructed from a symmetric invariant

tensor commutes with the non-local yangian charges. we have studied the algebra of
these local charges amongst themselves and found that for each classical algebra there is a
commuting family with spins equal to the exponents modulo the coxeter number. these

are dened by the universal formula for the currents

ks+1 = a(x, )s (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s+1

where

a(x, ) = det(1  j+)

(6.1)

and  = 1/h (or more generally for the b and c series,  can be arbitrary). this formula
also denes a current associated with the pfaan invariant for the d algebras, as well
as generalizations of this current, provided we consider an expansion in descending rather
than ascending powers of .

the existence of innitely many conserved charges in involution is a pre-requisite for
the classical integrability of any eld theory. it is worth emphasizing that the brackets

(2.16) do not apparently allow such a construction via the r-matrix formalism of classical
inverse scattering.12 we have shown explicitly how the poisson brackets (2.16) can lead
to innite sets of charges in involution, irrespective of the applicability of the classical
r-matrix formalism.

let us now turn to some broader questions surrounding the co-existence of local and non-

local charges in integrable eld theories, and how these can lead to common conclusions
via very dierent chains of argument. it is worth emphasizing that this happens at the

most fundamental level. the celebrated results which constrain the structure of the s-
matrix in two [30] (and four [31]) dimensions make use of the local character of conserved

quantities in an essential way. such arguments cannot be applied to non-local charges, and
yet these still lead to factorized s-matrices through their quasitriangular hopf algebra (or

quantum group) structure. in the pcms, the local charges appear to oer a more natural
explanation of why the fusings follow doreys rule than is currently available from yangian

12the quantum current algebra is a dierent matter: in the quantization method developed by faddeev
and reshetikhin [29] for instance there is a manifestly lorentz-covariant quantum current algebra derived
from a spin model, with spin-scale s. the classical limit h  0 and the continuum limit s   do not
commute. if taken in one order, the result is (2.16), but if the order of the limits is reversed, one nds
a dierent set of classical poisson brackets without non-ultralocal terms, which could lead to charges in
involution via an r-matrix.

27

representations. it would be interesting to investigate other integrable models with such
results in mind, and to determine whether features usually associated with the many exotic
properties of non-local charges might also be explained by the existence of local charges,

perhaps more simply.

it is also natural to seek some general, model-independent way of relating local and

non-local conserved quantities. the yangian y (g) has a trivial centre [32], so it seems
that we cannot hope to construct local charges which commute as casimirs in y (g) by

taking polynomials or series in the yangian charges. another avenue would be to consider
the transfer matrix which generates the non-local charges, but it is far from clear to us

how our local charges might emerge from this (see also e.g. [33, 34]). from yet another
point of view, there are hints of a connection of the type we seek in recent work of frenkel
and reshetikhin on deformed w -algebras ([35] and references therein).

finally we mention that many of the features we have identied in this paper also appear
in the supersymmetric principal chiral model, which we shall deal with in a forthcoming

paper (some preliminary results are reported in [36]).

7 appendix: an alternative derivation of poisson brackets

the pcm can be regarded as a special case of a general -model with lagrangian

l =

1
2

gij() i j

where i are coordinates on some target manifold with metric gij(). the momenta con-
jugate to the elds i are

i =

l
 i

= gij() j

28

with the standard non-vanishing equal-time pbs

{ i(x), j(y) } = i

j (x  y) .

we may now consider a current of the form

j a
 = ea

i i

where ea

i () are vielbeins on the target manifold satisfying

ea

i ea

j = gij

(whether these currents are actually conserved or not is irrelevant for the arguments here.)
in terms of the canonical coordinates i and i we have

0 = ea
j a

i gijj

1 = ea
j a

i  i .

the pb algebra of these currents can now be calculated routinely, although the general
result requires some eort and is not particularly illuminating.

important simplication occurs for the special case of a group manifold, with currents

dened by the vielbeins

where

er a

i = tr(tag1ig) ,

el a
i = tr(taigg1)

er
i = g1ig ,

el

i = igg1

are the left-invariant and right-invariant forms on the group respectively (so our labels

l and r signify the symmetries under which the vielbeins transform). to simplify the
current algebra calculations it is necessary to use only the properties

[iej] = e[iej]

(the maurer-cartan relations) which are easily veried from the denitions above. the

poisson brackets (2.16) then follow.

8 appendix: computing poisson brackets in so(2) pcm

the following method applies to any of the local conserved charges in the so(2) pcm,
including the pfaan and its generalizations.

29

at each point in space, j+(x) is a real 22 antisymmetric matrix. let its skew eigen-

values be i, so that there exists an orthogonal u and block diagonal d with

uj+u 1 = d =



xi=1

imi = diag(cid:18)(cid:18) 0
1

1

0 (cid:19) . . .(cid:18) 0




0 (cid:19)(cid:19) .

the block diagonal matrices {mi} form a basis for the cartan subalgebra so(2). . .so(2)
of so(2), and are clearly normalized so that tr(mimj) = 2ij.

any function of the current j+(x) which is invariant under the adjoint action of the lie

algebra must depend only on the eigenvalues i. for example, we have

j2n = tr(j2n

+ ) = 2(1)n

2n
i



xi=1

and

p = 1 . . .  .

to compute the poisson bracket of two invariants p (j+(x)) and q(j+(y)) it therefore
suces to know the poisson brackets between the eigenvalues. there are potential compli-
cations from the fact that the orthogonal matrix u needed to diagonalize the current j+(x)
is itself a complicated function of this current. however, this turns out to be irrelevant to
the computation of the poisson brackets, as we now show.

from (2.17) (with  = 1/2) and the arguments of section 4, we know that the only

contribution to the poisson bracket is

{p (j+(x)), q(j+(y))} =

p (x)
ja
+(x)

q(y)
ja
+(y)

(x  y).

since p depends on j+ only through its eigenvalues we can write

p (x)
ja
+(x)

= xi

p (x)
i(x)

i(ja
ja

+(x))
+(x)

(and similarly for q) and from the denition of i given above we nd

i(ja

but the second term involving the commutator vanishes by antisymmetry of the matrix
uu 1 (this belongs to the lie algebra so(2)) in conjunction with the block-diagonal
ja
structure of d. using the completeness condition for the generators {ta} of so(2), we
obtain the simple result

{p (j+(x)), q(j+(y))} =

p (x)
i(x)

q(y)
i(y)

(x  y).

this allows an easy derivation of equations such as (4.28). in fact, all the poisson bracket
calculations for the so(2) pcm can be performed in this way if the formulas involving the
generating functions are re-expressed in terms of eigenvalues. this provides an important

independent check on our calculations using generating functions.

9 appendix: comparing currents in su (4) and so(6) pcms

the denition (4.11) is in this case

from which we obtain non-trivial, odd-spin currents:

with a standard choice of normalization, the relationships between invariants in the four-

on substituting into the expressions for the conserved currents written above we nd
agreement with (4.33) up to overall constants.
