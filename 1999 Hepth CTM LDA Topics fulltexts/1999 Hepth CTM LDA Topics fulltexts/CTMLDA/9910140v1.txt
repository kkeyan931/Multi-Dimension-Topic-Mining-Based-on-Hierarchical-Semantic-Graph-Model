1. introduction

decoherence - the phenomenon whereby a quantum system initially in
a pure state evolves into a improper mixture due to interaction with its
environment[1] - has been studied extensively, using both toy models[2] and
more complex models representing real physical situations[3]. sources of
decoherence such as scattering[4, 5] and quantum gravity[6, 7] and both
internal[8, 9] and external[10, 11] environment are taken into consideration.
omnes[12] recently presented a general theory of the eect of decoherence
that includes both the harmonic model of caldeira-legett [10] and the ex-
ternal environment considered by joos and zeh[11] and is related to the
quantum state[13] diusion model.

decoherence is especially interesting as it promise to solve the old problem
of how to derive the classical behaviour of macroscopic bodies from quan-
tum principles. in fact, in the case of a macroscopic body, decoherence is
believed to suppress the o-diagonal elements of the spatial reduced matrix
of the centre of mass, irrespective of initial conditions. this is equivalent
to establishing a superselection rule for the position of macroscopic bodies
and to saying that we cannot experience spatial macrosuperpositions. we
can thus explain why we do not encounter states of this kind when looking
at everyday objects. to derive such a result it is not necessary to consider
an external environment. in fact, a system of many particles like a macro-
scopic body may be considered as consisting formally of a collective system
described by the collective coordinates, and the system described by its mi-
croscopic coordinates, which can act as an (internal) environment if the two
formal systems are coupled. this coupling may be either guaranteed by
some constraints or caused by an external potential. of course in the case
of an isolated macroscopic body, the hamiltonian consist of the sum of two
separate hamiltonians relative to the centre of mass and internal variables
respectively, there is no coupling between them and so decoherence of the
collective variable is not possible. however, we wish to signal a possible case
of decoherence, with suppression of correlations in the total momentum, for
a system of particles even if isolated, provided that we consider relativistic
corrections to the non-relativistic hamiltonian. it would pointed out that de-

2

coherence of isolated systems has been discussed before in various contexts:
halliwell[8] investigated the variables that will generally become eectively
classical as the local densities (of number of particles, momentum, energy),
calzetta and hu[14] the decoherence of histories of certain correlation func-
tions in a eld theory. we should also mention that the diagonalization in the
square of momentum basis has been argued for a system of (non-relativistic)
particles interacting with the linearized gravitational eld[15].

it is know that in classical electrodynamic a system of interacting par-
ticles may be approximately described to terms of second order in 1/c by
a hamiltonian depending only on their positions and velocities, since the
radiation comes in with the terms of order 1/c3. the same may be said
for particles subject to gravitational interaction[16]. in this approximation
the total momentum of the system is no longer independent, but is coupled
to the internal degrees of freedom. so, if we adopt the above mentioned
hamiltonian (after due symmetrization) as the hamiltonian operator within
non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we may expect to have decoherence for
the collective variable tracing over the microscopic ones. this may occurs
even if the particles are not interacting, thanks to the relativistic correction
to their kinetic energy. the coupling we are talking about commute with
the non-relativistic free hamiltonian of the centre of mass (c.m.). as we
learned from studies of wide-open quantum systems[17], the diagonalization
is to be expected in the basis of any dynamical operator commuting with the
coupling terms and so your candidate to be a preferred basis is that of total
momentum. the importance of an interaction commuting with the preferred
basis was already stressed by zurek[18].

since the aim of this note is merely to briey signal such a possibility, we
will consider for the sake of simplicity a system of n free spinless particles
of equal mass m in one dimension, a one dimensional ideal gas in fact. we
stress that we intend to work within the non-relativistic quantum mechanics
and consider the correction to the kinetic energy and its consequences as a
relativistic eect.

the model certainly is not realistic but we intend to oer the result as a
further case of decoherence with not usual features. not usual because the
system is isolated and also because in our case the reduced statistical oper-
ator diagonalizes on the basis of the total momentum, which thus acquires
the status of preferred basis. we believe all this is interesting in itself. we
do like to stress that the calculations will be carried out without recourse to

3

any master equation but by following the schroedinger evolution of a pure
state. with the kinetic operator used, the galilean invariance is destroyed,
so we have to specify the reference frame we are referring to. a galilean
transformation corresponds to a translation of momenta. for the approxi-
mation we are using to make any sense, the reference frames to take into
consideration are obviously the ones (if they exist) for which the absolute
value of momentum for each particle is not signicantly likely to be of the
order of or greater than mc. this requisite can be expressed by applying
i i  m2c2 for every i. it will certainly be satised if the
i i  m2c2 also is. to establish a denite
reference frame, we will adopt the one in which, for a given wave function,
the last mentioned expression gives the lowest value. it will be the reference
frame in which the mean value of total momentum is zero. even selecting
the optimal reference frame, however, the validity of our approximation is
not automatically guaranteed and our result will be only signicant if the

ergy

the free hamiltonian which we will consider for quasi-relativistic particles

is:

.

using the momentum basis and with (p1, p2, . . . , pn) indicating the initial
state, we have the state at time t as follows:

|(t)i = eit/h[pn

i=1(

.

the i are not independent, since they must satisfy the relation pn
ative momenta. the last relative momentum is expressed as n = pn1

we now change the variables: pi = p/n+i, where p is the total momentum.
i=1 i = 0.
we will consider as independent variables p together with the rst n  1 rel-
i=1 i.
the jacobian determinant of the transformation is equal to 1. we will write
the integration volume element for the new variables as dv = dp ds, where

4

ds = d1 d2    dn1. using the new variables and taking into account the

i=1 i = 0 the expression above now becomes:

where (p, 1, 2, . . . , n) indicates (p/n + 1, p/n + 2, . . . , p/n + n) note

the projection hp |(t)i of the state vector at time t on an eigenstate |p i

by tracing h(t)|p ihp |(t)i upon the relative momenta i.e. integrating over
ds we get the reduced density matrix element on the total momentum basis:

where w = 3(p 2  p 2)/(4hn2m3c2) and z = (p   p )/(2hnm3c2). the
diagonal matrix elements are constant of motion, but when p  6= p  the in-
tegral in the previous expression may cancel out with time, in which case the
o-diagonal elements are cancelled out, meaning that we have decoherence.

3. evaluation of the reduced density matrix el-
ements

in order to understand the time behaviour of the matrix elements we are
interested in is thus necessary to evaluate the integral ip p . to take into
i=1 i we multiply the integrand by the delta
i=1 kidk and

i=1 i) using its fourier representation (1/2)r eipn

function (pn

consider n too as a independent integration variable. writing

g(p , p ; 1, . . . , n) = (p , 1, 2, . . . , n) (p , 1, 2, . . . , n)

5

and h(i) = w2

i + z3

i our integral becomes

ip p  = (1/2)r dkr eik1+ith(1)d1r eik2+ith(2)d2 . . .

r eikn+ith(n)dn g(p , p ; 1, 2, . . . , n)

.

let us start with the integration on n. we are interested in the behaviour
of the o diagonal matrix elements at large time, so we shall use asymptotic
expansions methods to evaluate the result. more precisely, we will look
at the method of stationary phase[19]. according to which, when t is a
large quantity, the major contribution to the value of the integral arises
from the immediate vicinity of the end points and from the vicinity of those
point at which h(n) is stationary, i.e. its rst derivative h(n) is equal
to zero.
in the rst approximation the contribution of stationary points
is more important. if we suppose that the function representing the intial
state is square integrable and thus going to zero at innity, we can disregard
the end points contribution at all. since only the neighbourhood matters,
asymptotic evaluation consists of replacing h(n) near any stationary point

n)2. by the same argument, the factor of
n as h(
eith(n) in the integrand, assuming it is a continuous function, is replaced by
its value at 
n and the integration is safely extended from  to +. we
will replace g(p , p ; 1, . . . , n) by g(p , p ; 1, . . . , 
n), but maintain the
dependence on n of eikn, since it belongs to the fourier representation of
the delta function, a non-continuous and singular function indeed. we have
two stationary points at n = 0 and n = 2w/(3z) = (p  + p )/2 these
two values are indicated as 1 and 2 respectively. the corresponding values
of the second derivative are h(1) = 2w and h(2) = 2w. using the
procedure illustrated above, we obtains:

n) + (1/2)h(

n)(n  

g(p , p ; 1, 2, . . . , 1)[2i/th(1)]1/2eith(1)+ik1ik2/(2th(1)) +
g(p , p ; 1, 2, . . . , 2)[2i/th(2)]1/2eith(2)+ik2ik2/(2th(2))

.

integrating now on n1 the two terms of the expression above we obtain the
sum of four terms, which are again doubled after the next integration and so
on. lastly the asymptotic expression of ip p  become

in the multiple sum, each of i1, i2, . . . , in assumes the value 1 or 2, correspond-

2n[p 

i1i2...in |(p , i1, . . . , in)||(p , i1, . . . , in)|]/p

where p is the number of terms which contribute with non zero value to the
sum. we used the denition of g(p , p ; 1, 2, . . . , n) already given and the
fact that p is equal or less than the 2n possible combinations of the indexes
ij.

at this point we will compare the o-diagonal matrix elements with the
diagonal ones. since the last are constant of motion, we do not expect it
would change the result, but to obtain a dimensionless expression. to this
end we need to establish a further bound. looking at the denition of the
reduced matrix elements we may state that

|p p | = ip p = z (p, 1, . . . , n)(p, 1, . . . , n) ds

is evidently greater or equal to the result of the integration over a nite
volume as the integrand is a positive quantity. let mc  i  mc be a
nite integration interval for each variable. recalling that only n  1 of them

are independent, as n = pn1

j=1 j:

|p p |  (2mc)n1 |(p, u1, u2 . . .)|2

7

where u1, u2 . . . denotes an internal point of the hypercube chosen as in-
tegration domain. we recall that the function |(p, u1, u2 . . .)| is assumed
as bounded everywhere. comparing now the o-diagonal elements to the
diagonal ones we will consider, to be democratic, the ratio of |p p  | to
(|p p  ||p p  |)1/2. using the inequalities already found:

|p p  |/|(p p  ||p p  |)1/2  2a|t/ |(n1)/2

the constant a denotes the quantity:

3|p 2p 2| is a characteristic time scale of the process such that when
t   the absolute values of the o diagonal elements are vanishing.
it
would be pointed out that actually we have decoherence in the basis of (non-
relativistic) kinetic energy e = p 2
2m of the c.m.. introducing e as a more
appropriate variable the decoherence time is better written as  = 2hm
3m |e e | .
it is inversely proportional to the dierence |e  e| and also decreases with
increasing total mass m as one may expect intuitively. with |e  e| of
the order of a few ev and with, say, ten particles, the characteristic time is
very small, about 1016sec.

as we anticipated and contrary to our initial prediction, the result we
have just found shows that the reduced density matrix diagonalizes on the

basis of bp 2 and not on that of total momentum bp . that is, they are the

matrix elements for which |p | 6= |p |, which we found go to zero as time
increases. but our expression for the asymptotic behaviour is not valid if
p  = p . in such a case, in fact, the function h() depends only on 3,
we have only a stationary point of the second order and the asymptotic
evaluation of our integral has to be worked out separately. to this end,
the integration interval in i is split into (0, ) and (, 0) and each of
the two integrals is integrated by parts a number of times, dierentiating
g(p , p ; 1, 2, . . . , n) and integrating the remaining factor of the integrand.
taking only the dominant term into account, asymptotically we have:

asymptotic estimate of the other half of the o-diagonal matrix elements for
which p  < p  is immediately obtained since |p p  | = |p p  | by hermiticity.
ai() for large and positive values of  tends exponentially to zero.
it is
also going to zero for  which tends towards , but now the behaviour
is like ||1/4. however, for a sucient number of particles (ve or more)
[ai()]n is integrable. summing up, |p p  |/(|p p  ||p p  |)1/2, if the number
of particle is as indicated, also tends asymptotically to zero when p  = p 
and we have a complete diagonalization on bp basis.

these ndings are strongly dependent on the assumption that the system
of particles is isolated. it presumes a not very realistic situation since from
physical viewpoint it is hard to exclude external inuences, and even under
the slight perturbation the time behaviour we obtained for the reduced matrix
elements would not persist. so, even if we intended to present our ndings
strictly as a mathematical result, a brief discussion about the persistence of
the present decoherence eect in the case of external perturbations imposes.
we will discuss this point in comparison with the case of a free non-relativistic
particle.

the time dependence in the momentum basis of a non-relativistic free

particle density matrix elements is simply:

(k) (k) eit (k2k2)

2mh

where (k) is the initial state. under a time average the expression above,
compared to the diagonal elements, which are constants of motion, becomes:

kk
kk 1/2

(k) (k)
|(k)||(k)|

t z t

eit/f ree dt

with, denoting as tk the kinetic energy, a decoherence time f ree =
|tk tk | .
since the integral gives a limited oscillating term the asymptotic behaviour

h

9

for the correlations of two dierent eigenstates of kinetic energie is as the
inverse power of time, namely as (t/f ree)1. let now consider a constant
perturbation given as a generic function of the energy f (t ), which commutes
with the free hamiltonian, and denes tk = tk  .

taking the time average requires to substitute the former integral with

the new expression:

1

t z t

0

dt e it

h [+f (tk )f (tk )].

for each value of  for which the argument of the exponential is zero the
integral gives just one. then for each k there are so many values of k as
the zeroes of the function f (tk)  f (tk  ) for which the averaged matrix
elements do not go to zero with increasing time. in the case of decoherence
we considered the role of a free particle is played by the centre of mass.
adding any constant perturbation f (tp ) to the hamiltonian of our isolated
system will not disturb at all the asymptotic behaviour of any reduced matrix
element.
in fact we merely have a change of their phases, whereas their
absolute values are left unchanged. this is a rather articial consideration,
since the sought disturbance is not very realistic. however this example may
deserve to show that our case of decoherence is persistent under disturbances
which only touches the matrix elements phases.

coming back to the case of the free non-relativistic particle, we now con-
sider a perturbation due to a constant force, adding to the free hamiltonian
the term h  = xf , which may be written as xmc/l. choosing the acting
force as the weight force, the quantity l is about 3  107sec.

it is easy to see that the wave function of the free falling particle evolves

with time in momentum basis as:

(k + mct/l) e

 i

2mh (k2t+k mc
l

t2+ m2c2
3 2
l

t3)

with the same initial condition as before. the above expression means that
in addition to the phase variation with time of each plane wave component,
the wave packet moves in momentum space at the rate of mc/l per sec.
this entails that, for a square integrable wave function, (k + mct/l) goes
in the long run to zero for any xed value of k and hence any density matrix
element with xed indexes do the same. for a wave packet with initial spread
k equal to some fractions of mc it will happen after a time of the order of

10

year. so we may disregard this kind of time dependence for the rst minutes.
within this approximation the time average of the normalized density matrix
elements gives:

(k) (k)

for z < 1 the fresnel integrals are increasing functions of the argument, and
both of them goes to the constant value 1/2 in the limit of large z. in conclu-
sion in the case of non-relativistic particle subjected to weight force we have
still decoherence with a 1/t asymptotic behaviour. the decoherence time
however is now the greater quantity m instead of f ree. we also examined
our system of free quasi-relativistic particles, in the case |p | 6= |p |, under
the perturbation of the weight force applied to the c.m.. we encountered
again three characteristic time scales, one of which is the already dened
 . at time t   but shorter than the analogue of m and in the worse
situation the o-diagonal density matrix elements dier from zero. we have
still decoherence, but with a greater decoherence time, the analogous of m.
however the time behaviour for the decays of correlations is now as 1/tn1.
we may conclude that the decoherence mechanism we presented here is
as robust or a little more robust to perturbations than the non-relativistic
free particle case, i. e. not very robust.

11

qh2

for the sake of completeness, we will also consider the case of relativis-
tic particles, using the so-called relativistic schroedinger equation. this
equation has been used in various situations, for example to study the sta-
bility of matter constituted of xed nuclei and electrons and the collapse of
stars of self-gravitating bosons or fermions[20]. it is obtained replacing in
the usual schroedinger equation the kinetic energy of a particle with its full
relativistic expression. let us suppose that there is a lorentz frame such that
i ip  |p/n| for a set r of values of p , the average value in question being
calculated by means of the above mentioned function (p, 1, 2, . . . , n). in
these conditions we can use a procedure similar to the previous one to calcu-
late the time behaviour of the o-diagonal reduced density matrix elements
whose indexes p , p  refer to eigenvalues of the total impulse belonging to

the set r. in fact, the kinetic energy qm2c4 + (p/n + i)2 of each particle i

can be developed with good approximation in power of i retaining the terms
up to 3
i . repeating, mutatis mutanda, the previous steps we once again nd
that the o-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix compared to
diagonal ones decrease asymptotically with time, as follows:

|p p  |/(|p p  ||p p  |)1/2  2c |t/r|(n1)/2

.

the constant c is:

denoting as 1, 2 the two new stationary points. the decoherence time is
now

he3e3

r =

nm 4c8|e  e|(e2 + ee + e2)

where e2 = m 2c4 + p 2c2. for e  e  10mc2, |e  e|  1ev and
considering about ten particles, we obtain r  1013sec. all of this applies,
we remind, if both |p | and |p | belong to r. as before, the result is that the

reduced matrix diagonalizes on the basis of bp 2. but here too our expression

for the asymptotic behaviour is not valid if |p | = |p |. in that case we have
a double stationary point, the evaluation of the o diagonal reduced matrix
elements has to be worked out separately with the result that asymptotically
|p p  | depends on time as |t|(n1)/3.

4. concluding remarks

using non-relativistic quantum mechanics, and within a reference frame
in which the system is on average at rest (i.e. its average total momentum is
zero), we have shown that a one-dimensional system of a sucient number
of free quasi-relativistic particles, even if isolated, may decohere on the basis
of the total momentum if we considers correction to kinetic energy to terms
of second order in 1/c. in other words, we have established, under the con-
ditions stated above, a superselection rule for the total momentum. for the
sake of completeness, we obtained similar results using the full relativistic
expression for the kinetic operator for those lorentz frames in which the rel-
ative momenta are much smaller than p/n, where p is the total momentum.
the decoherence we are talking about was obtained tracing upon the rela-
tive momenta. our choice of that coarse-graining seems natural if we want
to look at the system as a whole. the higher the number of particles, the
faster the decoherence, meaning that it becomes more eective in the macro-
scopic limit. what we found in the case of relativistic corrections within a
non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework may reasonably suggest that
isolated systems of charged or gravitational interacting particles, for which
the approximate hamiltonian we mentioned is adopted, present decoherence
on the basis of total momentum if we look at the system as a whole and
ignore the internal degrees of freedom. systems of this sort might include
atoms with many electrons, for instance. true, the hamiltonian in ques-
tion is not only approximated but also ignores spin, so it may be considered
semi-classic. the presumed eect is interesting anyway. if the number of
particles is very big, such that the system may be considered macroscopic,
it cannot be supposed to be isolated, due to the extraordinary density of
its energy levels and to the action of surrounding objects, even if this tends
towards zero. also we learned that our decoherence mechanism is not bery
robust to perturbations and so other non relativistic interaction terms will
cause a more eective and dierent phenomenologically decoherence of the
c.m. variables. the action of the external environment will certainly prevail,
so that the reduced density matrix for the collective variable of our system
will diagonalize on the basis of the position, as shown in many examples[11].
but a mesoscopic object, with a very small number of components, may
probably be considered isolated, if only for a short period of time. in which

13

case we get the following situation: macroscopic bodies appear in a localized
state, while particles made up of a small number of components would ap-
pear in well dened states of the total momentum. further, while not being
realistic, the model we have discussed for fully relativistic particles can be
applied to the case of multiple production in the two bodies collision at high
energy. as it is well known, the secondary particles produced in these exper-
iments have a transverse momentum pt, which is negligible compared with
the momentum parallel to the collision axis (pl), and in fact, one-dimensional
variables have been introduced already to describe the process[21]. a very
popular phenomenological model considers the secondaries in the nal state
as non-interacting particles grouped in clusters having a classical statistical
distribution in the longitudinal momentum or rapidity[22]. let us think of a
cluster in terms of our model (adapted for the purpose) and consider the rel-
ative momenta of the secondaries emitted from it to have values  pt, which
is much less (outside the central zone) than the total momentum of the sys-
tem. then we must conclude that the reduced density matrix of clusters
rapidly diagonalizes on the basis of their total momentum. which justies
their description in terms of classical statistical distribution.
