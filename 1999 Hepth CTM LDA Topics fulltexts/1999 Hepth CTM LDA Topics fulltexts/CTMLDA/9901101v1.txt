abstract

we show that type 0b theory has a classical ads5  s5 solution and argue that
it is stable at the string-theory level for small enough radius. the dual 4-d conformal
eld theory is the infrared limit of the theory on n electric d3-branes coincident with
n magnetic d3-branes. we explicitly construct this su (n )  su (n ) gauge theory with
global so(6) symmetry and verify that the one-loop term in the beta function vanishes
exactly, while the two-loop term vanishes in the large n limit. we nd that this theory
is related by a certain projection to the maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory
suggesting its large n conformal invariance to all orders in perturbation theory.

1. introduction

in recent papers [1,2,3] non-supersymmetric large n gauge theories dual to certain
backgrounds of the type 0 string theory [4] were studied. this work was inspired by the

recently discovered relations between type ii strings and superconformal gauge theories
on n coincident d3-branes [5,6,7,8,9], and, in particular, by polyakovs suggestion [10]
(building on his earlier work [11]) that the type 0 string theory in dimensions d  10 is a
natural setting for extending this duality to non-supersymmetric gauge theories.

the type 0 string [4] has world sheet supersymmetry but no space-time supersymme-
try. in both type 0a and type 0b theory the fermions are completely projected out of the
spectrum. the massless bosonic elds are as in the corresponding type ii theory (a or

b), but with the doubled set of ramond-ramond (r-r) elds. the spectrum of type 0
theory also contains a tachyon, but, as suggested in [10,1], its presence does not spoil the
application to large n gauge theories. in fact, the tachyon background provides a natu-
ral mechanism for breaking the conformal invariance and introducing the renormalization
group ow [1,2,3].

in [1] the 3 + 1 dimensional su (n ) theory coupled to 6 adjoint massless scalars
was constructed as the low-energy description of n coincident electric d3-branes. the

conjectured dual type 0b background thus carries n units of electric 5-form ux. the set
of equations for a background with a 5-form ux follows from the following action:

(1.1)

(1.2)

in [1,2,3] it was shown that, if the tachyonr-r eld coupling function f (t ) has a mini-
mum, then there exists an asymptotically free type 0 background with the tachyon approx-
imately localized near the minimum. the tachyon background induces a radial variation
of the dilaton  which has the physical interpretation of renormalization group ow. the
einstein metric is approximately ads5  s5, while the eective gauge coupling evolves
logarithmically with the scale [2,3]. in [2,3] the infrared behavior of the background was
also considered. it turns out that there is a xed point at innite coupling which, just like
the xed point at zero coupling, is characterized by the ads5  s5 einstein frame metric

1

[3]. we argued that there is a renormalization group trajectory extending all the way from
the zero coupling xed point in the uv to the innite coupling xed point in the ir.

in this paper we instead consider a background of type 0 theory which has exact

conformal invariance: in fact, a line of xed points. the existence of such a background

was pointed out already in [1]: it is the near-horizon region of the self-dual 3-brane of type
0b theory which, just as in the type iib case [12], turns out to be ads5  s5. in the type
iib case the dual gauge theory is n = 4 sym [7] but in the type 0b case it is dierent,
and its investigation is the main purpose of this paper.

the self-dual 3-brane is constructed by stacking equal numbers n of coincident electric

and magnetic 3-branes. we will show that the non-supersymmetric theory on this stack is
the su (n )su (n ) gauge theory coupled to 6 adjoint scalars of the rst su (n ), 6 adjoint
scalars of the second su (n ), and fermions in the bifundamental representations  4 weyl

fermions in the (n, n) and 4 weyl fermions in the (n, n). we will argue that this theory
is conformal in the large n limit. since it has the maximal global so(6) invariance, it does
not belong to a class of n = 0 large n orbifold cfts recently discussed in [13,14,15].
in section 2 we consider the classical equations for a dyonic type 0b 3-brane and nd
that for equal electric and magnetic charges there is an ads5s5 near-horizon solution. in
section 3 we discuss the dual eld theory and show that the 1-loop beta function vanishes

exactly, while the 2-loop correction vanishes in the large n limit. we further argue that all
higher order terms vanish in the large n limit because the eld theory can be interpreted
as a z2 projection of the n = 4 u (2n ) sym theory by (1)f combined with a z2 gauge
group twist. in section 4 we discuss the analogy between this projection and a similar
(1)f projection which connects the type ii and type 0 string theories compactied on a
circle [4,16,17,18].

2. the ads5  s5 background of type 0b theory

lets us parametrize the 10-d string-frame and einstein-frame metric as in [1] ( =

0, 1, 2, 3 are the 4-d indices)

ds2 = e

in terms of these variables the eective action describing radial evolution of the elds

corresponding to (1.1) becomes [1]

s = z d(cid:20) 1

2 2  52 + 1

(2.3)

here  = 1, and , ,  and t are functions of . for the case of the electric 5-form
background, it was shown in [1] that h(t ) = q2f 1(t ), where f (t ) is the tachyon5-
form coupling function (1.2) and q is the electric charge. generalizing to the presence of
magnetic 5-form charge p is straightforward, and we nd that

h(t ) = p 2f (t ) + q2f 1(t ) .

(2.4)

as in the familiar dilaton-vector coupling case, the potential that originates from the
f (t )f5f5 term in the full d = 10 action is invariant under the electro-magnetic duality
p  q, f  f 1.

the function h(t ) has an extremum at t = t0 such that f (t0) = q/p (we assume
that f (t ), q, p are non-negative). for q = p ( n ) we thus get f (t0) = 1 which has
a solution t0 = 0 (cf. (1.2)). then the tachyon equation is solved by t = 0, the dilaton
equation is solved by  = 0, and the equations for ,  are solved by the usual ads5  s5
background (note that h(0) = 2q2 for p = q)

 = ln(2q) + ln  ,

 = ln 2 + 1

2 ln  .

(2.5)

this is the near-horizon (2qe0  1) limit of the full 3-brane metric. after the change
of variables  = u4, the ads5  s5 metric is

an important issue is that of stability of the ads5  s5 background. considering
small perturbations of this background in the t -direction1 we learn that they are no
longer tachyonic for suciently small qe0 . indeed, the leading quadratic terms in the
uctuation of t near t0 = 0 in the potential u become:

u2 =

(2qe0)1/2 + f 2(0)(cid:21)t 2 + o(t 3) .

(2.7)

1 the perturbations of the scalar t near t = 0 do not mix with the dilaton-graviton perturba-
5 is zero in the self-dual 3-brane case. in general, the mixing

tions since the background value of f 2
of t and the r-r potential c4 uctuations is already eectively accounted for in u (see [19] for

a discussion of stability of a similar dilaton-vector system in 4 dimensions).

3

the condition of stability is thus

16f 2(0) > (2qe0)1/2 ,

(2.8)

which is satised for small enough qe0  n gs since f (0) = 1.

the stability is related to the fact that the t = 0 solution is an attractor: a generic
solution with t = t (0) at  = 0 evolves to the t = 0 solution at large . this is easy to
see explicitly, e.g., by approximating f (t ) by et which is equal to f2(t ) = 1 + t + 1
2 t 2 at
small t . then h(t ) = 2q2 cosh t which indeed gives a positive shift of the coecient of
the t 2 term in the potential. let us note in passing that the choice f (t ) = et , which is
in agreement with the perturbation-theory result f2(t ) of [1] at small t may have more
general signicance. it is a natural denition of the r-r  tachyon coupling consistent with

the expected electricmagnetic 5-form duality of the type 0b theory. in fact, consideration

of the d-brane action couplings in [1] implies that the sign of the tachyon tadpole should

be changed when changing from the electric to the magnetic 3-brane. thus, if we require
that under the 5-form duality t  t , then the r-r  tachyon coupling is xed to be
et f5f5. it is not completely clear, however, whether the massless eld/tachyon eective
action has to be symmetric under the duality.

a stability criterion similar to (2.8) was already found in [1] where it was noted that it
is opposite to the condition of validity of the gravity (leading order in ) approximation.
indeed, based on (2.8) one may hope that the theory is stable for qe0 < o(1), but here
the curvature of the background is of order 1 in string units and it is not clear a priori

whether the eective gravity approximation can be trusted in the rst place. we would like
to argue, though, that it indeed can be trusted due to the special nature of the ads5  s5
solution.

as we explained in [1], the tree-level eective action of the type 0b theory coincides

with that of the type iib theory on the subsector of bosonic elds of the type iib theory.
since the present self-dual solution has t = 0 and f5 = f5 (i.e. the non-vanishing elds
belong to the spectrum of type iib theory), we are in a position to argue that our solution
is exact to all orders in  just as it is in type iib theory [20]. the stability condition is
also expected to hold (at least qualitatively) since the higher-order in  corrections to the
t 2 term in the eective action are likely to involve powers of the weyl tensor, f 2
5 and the
ricci scalar which all vanish in the ads5  s5 background. if one accepts this argument,
then one is led to the conclusion that the dual eld theory which lives on the stack of
d3-branes is a stable large n cft as long as the t hooft coupling n g2
ym is not very

4

large: less than a number of order 102.2 in the next section we present a weak-coupling
analysis that provides some support for this conclusion.

we conclude that while the at space vacuum is unstable in type 0 string theory,
the ads5  s5 with self-dual 5-form ux should be a stable background for suciently
small radius. the r-r charge may thus lead to a novel mechanism of tachyon stabilization

as proposed in [1]. our conclusions are independent of the details of the tachyon  r-r
coupling function f (t ): any function such that f (0) = 1 and f (0) = 1 leads to the stable
ads5  s5 background. these properties of f (t ) are obviously satised by (1.2), and
therefore our conclusions are robust.

3. analysis of the field theory

the gso projections for open strings connecting the d-branes of type 0 theory were
considered in [22,1].3 in considering parallel like-charged d-branes we nd the same bosonic
spectrum as in the corresponding type ii theory, but the fermions are excluded. thus, for
n parallel electric d3-branes we get the u (n ) gauge theory coupled to 6 adjoint scalars

[1]. exactly the same theory is found in the case of n parallel magnetic d3-branes. now

we would like to stack n parallel electric and n parallel magnetic d3-branes. the new and

somewhat surprising feature is that an open string connecting an electric and a magnetic

d3-brane is actually a fermion [22]. it is clear that these fermions will transform in the
bifundamental representations of the u (n )  u (n ). it is remarkable that, although type
0 theory has no fermions in the bulk, they are present on the dyonic d3-brane.

it follows already from the perturbative analysis that a composite self-dual type 0b

d3-brane consisting of an electric d3-brane coincident with a magnetic d3-brane has a
number of special properties. from the results of [1] one nds that the tachyon tadpole

2 more precisely, the stability condition for a scalar eld with mass m 2 in ads5 space-time with
radius r is [21]: m 2  4r2, i.e. in the present case m 2  8(2qe0 )1/2. here the eective
mass parameter (measured in string frame,  = 1) is m 2 = 2 + 32f 2(0)(2qe0 )1/2, so the
stability condition is actually 4 + 16f 2(0)  (2qe0 )1/2. this does not, of course, qualitatively
change the above condition (2.8). note that once one is allowed to consider the ads5 radius to
be of order of , one in principle does not need the f (t ) coupling to achieve stability of the
string tachyon in ads5  s 5 background. but the coupling function f (t ) is non-trivial in type 0b
theory, and since f (0) = 1 [1], its contribution to the above condition is considerable. explicitly,
we get 1
coupling: g2

ymn , and thus the following stability condition on the t hooft

2 qe0 = 4gsn 2 = g2

ymn < 100.

3 open string descendants of type 0b theory were constructed by orientifold projection in [23].

has an opposite sign for the magnetic d3-brane compared to the electric one; therefore
the tadpole cancels on the self-dual d3-brane.4 also, if one uses the annulus calculations
to nd the net potential between two such parallel branes by adding up the potentials

between constituents, ones nds that it vanishes exactly by the abstruse identity. thus,

the self-dual d3-branes behave very much like bps states even though the type 0 theory

has no supersymmetry.

the fermionic nature of the strings connecting an electric and a magnetic d3-brane

is crucial for this cancellation. the normalization of the fermions in the annulus dia-

gram connecting an electric and a magnetic d3-brane is the same as between two self-dual
d3-branes of type iib theory. in that case the eective eld theory is the n = 4 super-
symmetric u (2) broken to u (1) u (1). each adjoint of u (2) produces elds with charges
(1, 1) and (1, 1) under the u (1)  u (1). since there are 4 adjoint weyl fermions in the
n = 4 supermultiplet, we nd 4 bifundamental fermions of each type. generalization to
n > 1 is straightforward: the eld theory on n electric and n magnetic d3-branes of type
0b theory contains 4 weyl fermions in the (n, n) of u (n )  u (n ) and 4 weyl fermions
in the (n, n).

the theory with the eld content derived above is quite special. first, it has equal
numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, 16n 2, and thus no induced one-loop
cosmological constant or quartic divergence. one also nds that the two coecients in the

(one-loop) gravitational trace anomaly are equal, i.e. there is a single central charge as
in the n = 4 sym theory. as we explain below, the theory is actually a supersymmetry
breaking projection of the n = 4 sym theory.

we assume as usual that the u (1) factors decouple in the infrared and consider the
su (n )su (n ) theory with the eld content derived above. based on our conjecture that
this eld theory is dual to the ads5s5 background, we expect that it is conformal. indeed,
4 indeed, the resulting self-dual d3-brane action is then decoupled from the tachyon and from
the second r-r potential c4 with anti-selfdual f5 [1], and so is essentially the same as in type iib.

in general, the bi part of the action isr d4x(1+ 1
where q = q = 1 for the electric, q = q = 1 for the magnetic and q = 2, q = 0 for the self-dual
d3-brane. the coecient of the tachyon tadpole was found in [1], and then on reparametrization
4 q qt +o(t 2)
invariance (and t -duality) grounds one expects that the tachyon function k(t ) = 1+ 1

multiplies the p det(g + f ) in the bi action. we have checked this by directly computing the

coecient of the t ff  term from the corresponding disc diagram. this calculation was in-
dependently carried out in the recent paper [24] where also the coecient of the t 2 term in k(t )
was found to be 1
32 in the electric (q = q = 1) case. this result suggests that the exact expression

for this function in the electric case is k(t ) = e

it is not hard to show that the one-loop beta function cancels. the one-loop coecient b1
in a gauge theory with group g coupled to scalars transforming in a representation s and

(2-component) weyl fermions transforming in a representation f is

(3.1)

where t2 is the dynkin index of the representation, tr(tatb) = t2ab. for the adjoint
representation of su (n ) t2 = c2(g) = n, while for the fundamental representation t2 =
1/2. as far as each su (n ) is concerned, we have 6 adjoint scalars and 8n fundamental

weyl fermions. it follows from (3.1) that the 1-loop beta function vanishes for each of the

two gauge couplings. in fact, we will set the two gauge couplings equal.

the two-loop gauge coupling beta function coecient is [25,26]

here c2(r) is the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir operator c2 = tata in a representa-
tion r, i.e. d(r)c2(r) = d(g)t2(r), where d(r) and d(g) are the dimensions of the rep-
resentation and the group. for the fundamental representation of su (n ) c2(f ) = n 21
2n .
y4 is the contribution of the yukawa couplings [26],

y4 =

where yi is the matrix determining the yukawa terms in the lagrangian, yi x i + h.c.,
where  = i2,  is the full set of 2-component fermions and x is the set of scalars. we
are assuming that, as in the n = 4 sym theory, the yukawa couplings are equal to the
gauge coupling constant.

the sums in (3.2) are over irreducible representations. since the gauge group here is

not simple and the fermions are not singlets in both of the groups (and thus intertwine the

renormalizations of the two gauge couplings), there is an important subtlety. in general,
for a product group with couplings g1 and g2 one should make make the replacement [26]:

(3.4)

this may be compared with the 2-loop coecient in the n = 4 sym theory [25,27], where
the yukawa contribution is important for the cancellation, b2 = 24n 2 + y4 = 0.

to compute y4 in our case let us specify the structure of the interaction terms in the
action more explicitly. we shall assume that, like the n = 4 sym theory, our theory
has a global su (4) symmetry. the fermions  = (, ) in the representations (n, n)
and (n, n) each transform as the 4 of su (4) (and their hermitian conjugates as the
4), while the adjoint scalars x = (x, x ) each transform as the 6 of su (4). then the
couplings of the fermions to the su (n )  su (n ) gauge eld (a, a) are, symbolically,
a( + ) and a( + ), while the yukawa couplings are x abab + h.c.
and x abab + h.c., where a, b = 1, 2, 3, 4. the value of the yukawa contribution y4
then turns out to be5

y4 = 24  2  2n 

d(f )
d(g)

[c2(f )]2 = 96c2(f )t2(f ) = 24(n 2  1) .

(3.5)

as a result, the leading o(n 2) term in (3.4) cancels out and we have b2 = 16.6 thus,
the theory is 2-loop nite in the large n limit.

in fact, we believe that the non-supersymmetric u (n )u (n ) theory we are consider-
ing can obtained from the n = 4 supersymmetric u (2n ) sym theory by twisting it with
(1)f in a very similar way to how the orbifold z2 theory is obtained [29]. the arguments
of [15] may then explain why this theory is conformal in the planar limit.

in the orbifold case the z2 reverses the sign of four of the scalar elds x and also of
their fermionic partners. if we think of the n = 4 multiplet as an n = 2 vector multiplet
plus a hypermultiplet, the z2 reverses the sign of the hypermultiplet elds. now, break up
the 2n  2n matrices into four n  n blocks. on the diagonal blocks we keep the elds
invariant under the z2, i.e. the vector multiplets. on the o-diagonal blocks we keep the
non-invariant elds, i.e. the hypermultiplets. this produces the n = 2 supersymmetric
u (n ) u (n ) theory coupled to two bifundamental hypermultiplets [29]. in eect, we are
keeping the elds invariant under the change of sign of the hypermultiplet accompanied by
the u (2n ) gauge group transformation i which is the conjugation by (cid:18) i
0 i (cid:19), where
i is the n  n unit matrix.

0

5 the su (4) part of the yukawa matrix y is the same as in the n = 4 sym, a
c b

c, and
the trace of its square is again 24. note that all the yukawa couplings (involving both sets of the

d b
d  a

scalar elds) contribute to the renormalization of each of the gauge coupling. another factor of 2

is related to the o-diagonal structure of the yukawa matrix.

6 this is similar to what happens in the orbifold eld theories of [13,14,15] as discussed

explicitly at the 2-loop level in [28].

8

in our case we take the z2 action to be i(1)f , i.e. the u (2n ) gauge transformation
is accompanied by the change of sign of all the fermionic elds. now on the diagonal blocks
we keep the invariant elds: the gauge eld and the 6 scalars. on the o-diagonal blocks
we keep the 4 weyl fermions. this gives the u (n )  u (n ) theory with 6 scalar adjoints
of each u (n ), and 8 bifundamental weyl fermions. the meaning of the i transformation
c d (cid:19) is that it projects out the states corresponding to open strings
(cid:18) a b
c d(cid:19)  (cid:18) a b
connecting n electric and n magnetic branes; combining it with (1)f then allows back
the fermionic connecting strings.

4. discussion

one fascinating application of the ads/cft correspondence is towards the classi-
cation of 4-dimensional conformal gauge theories. for example,
interesting large n
cfts with less than maximal supersymmetry are found in the type iib setting when
the s5 is replaced by orbifolds of s5 [13,14] or by other einstein manifolds [30]. certain
non-supersymmetric large n cfts whose eld theoretic formulation is less transparent
were studied in [31]. in this paper we propose another route towards constructing non-
supersymmetric large n cfts: by looking for dual backgrounds of the type 0b theory.
the simplest, and most symmetric, background is ads5s5. here we have found the dual
gauge theory which implements the corresponding so(2, 4)  so(6) symmetry. just like
most non-supersymmetric orbifold cfts [13,14,28], this theory appears to be conformal
only in the large n t hooft limit. if n is kept nite then the 2-loop beta function does
not cancel exactly.

we have shown that our cft may be obtained by a i  (1)f projection of the n = 4
sym theory. the (1)f projection is related to the general fact that the type 0 theory is a
(1)f orbifold (f is the full space-time fermion number) of the type ii theory [4,16,17,18].
indeed, the space-time fermions, which are the non-invariant states, are projected out.
thus, it is not too surprising that the self-dual 3-brane of type 0b theory is related by a
similar projection to the self-dual 3-brane of type iib theory. as we have seen, the full z2
action on the stack of d3-branes includes also the gauge transformation i.

we have argued that the ads5s5 background, which exists only for a non-vanishing
r-r ux, is stable when its radius is of order the string scale or smaller. this suggests
that the type 0 theory is not just a formal twisting of type ii theory but, in fact, ts
naturally into the ads/cft duality. indeed, there is a general relation between type ii
and type 0 theories which may have new implications in the presence of a (large) number
of d-branes or r-r ux. as was pointed out in [17,18], compactifying type ii theory

9

on a 9-circle and applying the (1)f projection in combination with (1)2ir9p9 (p9 is
momentum operator) gives a theory which interpolates between the type iib theory at
r9   and the type 0b theory at r9  0. equivalently, considering type ii theory
at nite temperature, i.e. compactifying the euclidean time direction with antiperiodic
boundary conditions for space-time fermions, one concludes [16] that the type 0 theory is

the high temperature limit of the type ii theory. of course, in at space one expects a
hagedorn phase transition to take place at the temperature of order the string scale, so

that the high-temperature limit is formal. it may be interesting, however, to reexamine
the issue of the phase transition for backgrounds with r-r ux.

the relation between the type 0 theory and the thermal type ii theory suggests a
connection between the type 0 scenario for constructing non-supersymmetric gauge theory
and the temperature induced supersymmetry breaking proposed by witten [32]. however,

in [32] the temperature was taken to be much lower than the string scale while in the
type 0 setting it is much higher. nevertheless, there are some similarities between the two

approaches which may be pursued further.
