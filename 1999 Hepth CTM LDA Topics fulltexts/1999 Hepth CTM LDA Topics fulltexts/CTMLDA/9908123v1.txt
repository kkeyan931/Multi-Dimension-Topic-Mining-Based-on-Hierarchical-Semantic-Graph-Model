abstract

features of screening and connement are reviewed in two-dimensional quan-

tum electrodynamics (qed2). our discussion is carried out using the gauge-

invariant but path-dependent variables formalism. this alternative and useful

approach exploits the rich structure of the electromagnetic cloud or dressing

around static fermions in a straightforward and simple way.

i. introduction

it is well known that one of the long standing problems in physics is understanding con-

nement of quarks and gluons from rst principles. the reason is that infrared divergences

and gauge dependence make bound-state equations very dicult to approximate. in this

paper we want to address the issue of gauge dependence within the connement problem.

our purpose is to present a formalism in which everything is expressed in terms of physical

(gauge invariant) quantities from the start. as a bonus, the usual qualitative picture of

connement, in terms of an electric ux tube linking quarks [1,2], emerges naturally in this

formalism.

as a rst step we will consider two dimensional gauge theories, which can be regarded as

a theoretical laboratory for studying four-dimensional gauge theories. of particular interest

are non-perturbative issues such as connement and spectrum of models, which can be

settled in these theories. of these, the schwinger model [3] has probably enjoyed the greatest

popularity due to several features that it possesses. for instance, the spectrum contains a

massive mode, the charge is screened and connement is satisfactorily addressed. we also

draw attention to the fact that the transition from screening to connement of probe charges

is possible only for nonvanishing spinor mass [4,5].

on the other hand, in recent times a description in terms of gauge-invariant but path-

dependent eld variables in abelian gauge theories, and the intimately related question

of gauge xing, has been developed [6,7]. in particular, it was shown how the gauge xing

procedure corresponds, in this formalism, to a path choice. therefore this represents a path-

dependent but physical qed where a consistent quantization directly in the path space is

carried out.

incidentally, it is of interest to notice that the physical electron is not the

lagrangian fermion, which is neither gauge-invariant nor associated with an electric eld.

instead, the physical electron is the lagrangian fermion together with a non-local cloud (or

dressing) of gauge elds [8]. this remark opens up the way to a stimulating discussion of

how the electromagnetic cloud is distributed around fermions.

within this framework the aim of the present paper is to reexamine some aspects about

screening and connement in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics from the viewpoint

of the gauge-invariant formalism. this oers a natural setting for such studies, because it

involves the use of strings to carry electric ux. moreover, we obtain computational rules

that have clear as well as simple interpretation, in contrast to the standard wilson loop

procedure where subtleties related to the correct calculation must be considered [9,10]. in

sec. ii we present gauge-invariant expressions which will form the basis of our subsequent

considerations. sec. iii constitutes the central part of our work. specically, we calculate

the interaction energy between external probe sources, paying due attention to the structure

of the elds that surround the charges. here we will focus our attention on the transition

2

from screening to connement.

ii. gauge-invariant variables

let us start our analysis with a brief presentation of the gauge-invariant variables for-

malism [6,7]. for this purpose, we introduce the vector gauge-invariant eld

a(y) = a(y) +  zcy

dza(z)! ,

(1)

where the path integral is to be evaluated along some contour cy connecting  and y. here

a is the usual electromagnetic potential and, in principle, it is taken in an arbitrary gauge.

the point we wish to emphasize, however, is that a(y) is invariant with respect to gauge
transformations

a(y)  a(y) + (y).

(2)

thus a, while no longer gauge-dependent, now becomes path-dependent. we now choose
the contour as the spacelike straight line z1 = 1 + (y  )1, where  (0    1) is the
parameter describing the contour and 1 is an arbitrary (xed) reference point. without

loss of generality, we can choose 1 = 0. this path choice may be made more explicit by

splitting eq.(1) in the form

a short calculation yields

a1(x) = a1(x)  1

a0(x) = a0(x)  0

1

z0

1

z0

dx1a1(x1),

dx1a1(x1),

a1(x0, x1) = 0,

a0(x0, x1) =

1

z0

dx1e1(x1),

3

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

where e1 is the one-dimensional electric eld. the above expressions coincide with the

poincare gauge conditions [6].

we now turn our attention to the fermion eld. in this formalism the charged matter

eld together with the electromagnetic cloud (dressing) which surrounds it, or what is the

same the physical electron, is given by [6,8],

(y) = exp iezcy

dza(z)! (y).

following our path choice, expression ( 7) may be rewritten as

(y) = exp(cid:18)iez y



dz1a1(z)(cid:19) (y).

(7)

(8)

it is worthwhile remarking at this point that the breaking of the gauge invariance of the

elds in the standard formalism is transformed into breaking of the translational invariance

in the path-dependent formalism. the way of solving this problem is letting the reference

point 1 go to innity.

before we proceed further, we wish to show that this approach yields interesting results

by calculating a gauge-invariant photon propagator. from the expression for the physical

elds (1) it can be shown that the gauge-invariant propagator is given by

d(x, y) = d(x, y) +



x z 

x

dzd(z, y) +

dwd(x, w)+

y



y z 
dzz 

y

+



xy z 

x

dwd(z, w).

(9)

d(x, y) on the right-hand side (rhs) of eq.(9) is the photon propagator taken in an

arbitrary gauge. implementation of the poincare gauge amounts to using the contour z1 =
1 + (y )1 and z1 = 1 + (x )1. we can choose, for example, d(x, y) in the temporal
gauge, that is,

d(x, y) = g1g1(x1  y1)(cid:18)1

2|x0  y0| + b(x0  y0)  a(cid:19) ,

(10)

where, as it is well known, the residual gauge invariance manifests itself in the presence of

the constants a and b. this is a peculiarity of the temporal gauge, which does not x the

gauge uniquely. then, from eq.(9), we nd that

4

d(x, y) = g0g0

1
2

(x0  y0)(cid:16)|x1  y1|  |x1  1|  |y1  1|(cid:17) .

(11)

thus one avoids the unphysical features associated with the gauge-dependent formulation.

nevertheless, as it should be expected, the above propagator breaks the translational invari-

ance. the solution to this problem is letting 1 go to innity. however, we do not intend to

address these problems here. a fuller account on gauge invariant greens functions will be

provided elsewhere [11].

this concludes our brief introduction to gauge invariant variables and gauge conditions.

iii. interaction energy in qed2

as already mentioned, our immediate objective is to calculate the interaction energy

between external probe sources in the schwinger model. to do this, we will exploit the rich

structure of the electromagnetic cloud or dressing around static fermions.

we shall begin by considering the bosonized form of the schwinger model [12]:

1
4

f 2

 +

1
2

()() 

l = 
where j 0 is the external current, p = e

and  refers to the  vacuum.

2

e
2

 f  + +mx (cos (2 + )  1)  a0j 0,

(12)

exp(e) with e the euler-mascheroni constant,

3
2

a. massless case

our purpose is to compute the interaction energy in the m = 0 case. the rst step in

this direction is to carry out the integration over  in (12). this allows us to write the

eective lagrangian

l = 

1
4

f  1 +

e2


1

2! f   a0j 0.

(13)

it is worthwhile sketching at this point the canonical quantization of this theory from the

hamiltonian analysis point of view. the canonical momenta are  = (cid:16)1 + e2



with the only nonvanishing canonical poisson brackets being

1

 2(cid:17) f 0

5

{a(t, x), (t, y)} = 

(x  y).

since 0 vanishes we have the usual primary constraint 0 = 0 , and 1 = (cid:16)1 + e2



therefore the canonical hamiltonian is

(14)

1

 2(cid:17) f 10 .

(15)

hc = z dx


1
2

1 1 +

e2


1

2!1

1 + 11a0 + a0j 0
.

requiring the primary constraint 0 = 0 to be preserved in time yields the following sec-

ondary constraint

1(x) = 11  j 0.

(16)

it is straightforward to check that there are no more constraints in the theory and that both

constraints are rst class. the hamiltonian that generates translations in time is given by

h = hc +z dx (c0(x)0(x) + c1(x)1(x)),

(17)

where c0(x) and c1(x) are arbitrary functions. furthermore, since 0 = 0 always, and

a0 (x) = [a0(x), h] = c0(x) , we discard a0(x) and 0(x) . therefore the hamiltonian

reduces to

h = z dx

where c(x) = c1(x)  a0(x).



1
2

1 1 +

e2


1

2!1

1 + c(x)(cid:16)11  j 0(cid:17)


,

(18)

according to the usual procedure we introduce a supplementary condition on the vector

potential such that the full set of constraints becomes second class, so we write

2(x) = z 1

0

dx1a1(x) = 0,

(19)

where, as in the previous section,  is the parameter describing a spacelike straight line of

integration. it immediately follows that the fundamental dirac brackets read

na1(x), a1(y)o

= 0 = n1(x), 1(x)o

,

na1(x), 1(y)o

= (1)(x  y)  x

1 z 1

0

dx1(1)(x  y).

6

(20)

(21)

it is important to realize that expression (8) represents charged particles together with an

associated proper electric eld. to see how this arises let | ei be an eigenvector of the
electric eld operator e1(x), with eigenvalue 1(x) :

e1(x) | ei = 1(x) | ei.

next we will consider the state (y) | ei. by means of eq. (22) we have that

e1(x)(y) | ei = (y)e1(x) | ei + [e1(x), (y)] | ei.

from our above hamiltonian analysis, eq. (23) may be rewritten as

e1(x)(y) | ei = 

1(x) + q 1 +

e2


1
2

x!1

z 1

0

dy1(1)(y1  x1)

 (y) | ei.

(22)

(23)

(24)

hence we see that the operator (y) is the dressing operator of the creation of an electron

together with an associated proper electric eld. notice that the integral in eq.(24) is

nonvanishing only on the contour of integration. as a result, we have a static electric eld

on a line.

at this point we should mention that if we consider a modied form for the electromag-

netic cloud in the poincare gauge eq.(8), which is equivalent to the coulomb gauge [6], that

is,

(y) = exp(cid:18)iqz y

0

dzkal

k (z)(cid:19) (y),

(25)

where al

1 refers to the longitudinal part of a1, we would obtain that the eld  dresses the

charge  with the electric eld :

e1(x)(y) | ei = (cid:18)1(x) +

e e


q
2

|x1y1|(cid:19) (y) | ei.

(26)

in order to calculate the energy between external static charges, we take a fermion

localized at y

1 and an antifermion at y1, both dressed according to eq.(8), and compute the
expectation value of the qed2 hamiltonian in the physical state | i, which we will denote
by hhi. from our above hamiltonian structure, we have that

7

hhi = h|z dx1


1
2

1 1 +

e2


1

2!1

1
|i .

(27)

as mentioned before, the fermions are taken to be static, thus we can substitute 2 by -2
1

in eq.(27). in that case we write

hhi = h|z dx1


1
2

1 1 

e2


1
2

1!1

1
 |i .

(28)

as has been established by dirac [8], the physical states |i correspond to the gauge invariant
ones. in this way, the state corresponding to two opposite charges at dierent points can

be made gauge invariant by including a dressing as in eq.(8), which keeps the entire state

gauge invariant. in other words,

| i | (y)(y)i = (y) exp iqz y

y

dz1a1(z)! (y) |0i ,

(29)

where |0i is the physical vacuum state.

we are now ready to calculate hhi . using our formalism, we can show that

e1(x) |i = (y)(y)e1(x) |0i + q 1 

e2


1
2

1!1

z y

y

dz1(x1  z1) |i .

(30)

inserting this into eq. (28), the energy in the presence of the static charges will be given by

hhi = hhi0 +

q2
2


e (cid:16)1  e e



|yy|(cid:17) ,

(31)

where hhio = h0| h |0i . since the potential is given by the term of the energy which
depends on the separation of the two fermions, from the expression (31) we obtain

v =

q2
2


e (cid:16)1  e e



|yy|(cid:17) .

(32)

thus we have demonstrated that the potential between fermions can be directly obtained

once the structure of the photonic clouds around static fermions is known.

in this case

expression (32) is the expected screening contribution to the potential. physically this means

that the initial string was broken and all the charges are screened. in other terms, as a result

of the interaction with massless fermions the original coulomb potential ( proportional to

8

the distance ) is screened. this feature is similar to that expected for qcd strings in the

adjoint representation.

before we conclude this subsection, it is important to notice that with the path choice

stated in eq.(25) (modied poincare gauge), and from the previous canonical formalism, we

can write a scalar potential

ao(t, x) = z 1

0

dx1el

1 (t, x) = z 1

0

dx1 1 

e2


1
2

1!1

x

x
1

(j 0(x))
2
x

,

(33)

where the superscript l refers to the longitudinal part and j 0 is the external source. ac-

cordingly, the potential for a pair of static pointlike opposite charges located at y and y ,
that is, j 0(t, x) = q{(x  y)  (x  y)}, is given by

v = q (a0(y)  a0(y)) =

q2
2

|yy|(cid:17) .

(34)


e (cid:16)1  e e



it is gratifying to notice here the simplicity and directness of this derivation, which is man-

ifestly gauge-invariant.

b. massive case

we now proceed to consider the massive case. for this purpose we have to carry out the

integration over  in (12). but since this expression is non-polynomial in , we expand the

eective lagrangian in terms of f . thus it follows that

l = 

1
4

f 2
 

e2
4

f

1

2 + 4m

f   a0j 0,

(35)

where we have taken  = 0. if we now look at the limit of slowly varying elds, we nd that

l = 

1
4

f  1 +

e2

42m! f   a0j 0.

(36)

as in the previous subsection, our objective will be to calculate the potential energy for this

theory. however, as we now know, this calculation is facilitated by using the expression:

a0(t, x) = z 1

0

dx1el

1 (t, x).

9

(37)

thus we obtain

a0(t, x) =  1 +

e2

42m!1

z 1

0

dx1 x

1 (j 0(x))

2
x

.

(38)

for j 0(t, x) = q((x  a)) expression (38) then becomes

a0(t, x) =

q

2  1 +

e2

42m!1

|x  a|.

(39)

by means of expression (39) we evaluate the interaction energy for a pair of static pointlike

opposite charges at y and y, as

v = q (a0(y)  a0(y)) =

q2

2  1 +

e2

42m!1

|y  y|.

considering the limit m  e, we get

v =

q2
e2 22m|y  y|.

(40)

(41)

this can be recognized as the standard result for the interaction potential [4], which is also

just the connement contribution to the potential. this derivation tells us that one can in

fact interpolate between screening and connement as soon as the dynamical fermions have

a nonvanishing mass. it is therefore of interest to reexamine the transition between these

limits. to see how this arises in this formalism, we start with eq.(35). using the fact that
the elds are taken to be static, which means substituting 2 by 2

1 , we get

l = 

1
4

f 2

 +

e2
4

f

1

2
1  4m

f   a0j 0.

(42)

thus, in the present approach, the scalar potential (37) may be written as

a0(t, x) = z 1

0

dx1x

1  

j 0(x)
2

x  2!  4mz 1

dx1 x

1 (j 0(x))
(2  2)x2

where 2  e2

 + 4m. for j 0(t, x) = q((x  a)) eq.(43) reduces to
2
 a.

2 (cid:19)(cid:16)1  ea(cid:17) +

2 
1 

2 (cid:18)1 +

a0(t, x) =

q

q

,

(43)

(44)

expression (44) immediately shows that the potential for two opposite charges located at y

and y is given by

10

v =

4m

2 (cid:19)(cid:16)1  e|yy|(cid:17) +

q2

2 
1 

e2


2
|y  y|.

it is straightforward to check that in the limit m = 0, expression (45) reduces to (34).

(45)

until now we have taken the vacuum angle  as zero. we now want to consider the

nonvanishing  contribution to the potential that would follow from this formalism. with

this in mind, we start by writing

l = 

1
4

f f  

e2
4

f

1

2 + 4m

f  + em

1

2 + 4m

 f   a0j 0.

(46)

since we are dealing with static fermions, we can substitute 2 by 2
write

1 . in that case we

l = 

1
4

f  1 

e2


1

1  4m! f   em

2

1

2
1  4m

  a0j 0.

(47)

but since the rst term on the right-hand side (rhs) of eq.

(47) gave as a result the

potential given in eq. (42), we only need to consider the second,  dependent, term. using

(37), we may write the expression for the scalar potential in the form

0(t, x) = z 1
a

0

dx12em(cid:16)2

1  2(cid:17)1

,

(48)

where 2  e2

 + 4m. if we now look at the limit of slowly varying elds, we nd that

0(t, x) = z 1
a

0

d

2em

2

x1 = 

e

2 
1 

e2


2
 x1.

(49)

hence we see that the potential for two opposite charges ( for q = e ) at y and y is given by

v  = 

e2

2 
1 

e2


2




|y  y|.

(50)

it is also, up to the  
in the limit of slowly varying elds, the inclusion of the  term would reduce the potential

 factor, just the coulomb potential. from this expression we see that,

to

v =

 1 



! |y  y|.

(51)

an immediate consequence of this is that for  =  the connement term vanishes [5].
