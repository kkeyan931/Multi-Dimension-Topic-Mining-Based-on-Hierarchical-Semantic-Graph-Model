abstract

it is shown that noncommutative geometry is a nonperturbative
regulator which can manifestly preserve a space supersymmetry and
a supergauge symmetry while keeping only nite number of degrees
of freedom in the theory. the simplest n = 1 case of the u (1) super-
gauge theory on the sphere is worked out in detail.

1 introduction

there is a widespread belief that it is unlikely having any regulated form of
the theory with the supersymmetry besides string theory [1]. nevertheless,
we wish to show here, though only in the simplest possible case of the super-
symmetric schwinger model in two dimensions, that there exists a regulator
reconciling the supersymmetry with the short distance cut-o. moreover,
this regulator has two advantages with respect to strings. first of all, it
is genuinely nonperturbative and, secondly, it is more economic because it
requires only nite number of degrees of freedom in game.

the mathematical structure which is behind this regulator is noncommu-
tative geometry. it is a discipline largely developed by a. connes [2] and
besides applications in the physics of the standard model it is expected to
have an important impact on a general structure of quantum eld theory [3].
it was actually from the nocommutative rather than from the supersymmet-
ric side where the motivation for this work came from. one could witness in
the last few years a lot of activity [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] concerning model
building on the so-called fuzzy sphere. the latter concept was probably in-
vented by berezin [12], but the idea to use it for regularization of scalar eld
theories was independently advocated rstly in [13] and [14].

we should perhaps mention, in order to avoid a misunderstanding, that
all quoted references do not study the fuzzy sphere as such but rather eld
theories on it. in the same spirit, we may say that people working on quan-
tum inverse scattering method in two dimensions have not been studying
the two dimensional minkowski space but the immensely rich world of two-
dimensional eld theoretical models living on it. so a question why to devote
so much time for studying the fuzzy sphere is not well posed; oned better
ask: which theories one can formulate on it?

there is an encouraging experience so far that all interesting eld the-
oretical structures can be formulated on the fuzzy sphere. we mean here
theories including fermions [4, 9, 7, 11, 10], gauge elds [8, 9, 7, 11], topo-
logically nontrivial eld congurations [5, 10] and even those incorporating
superscalar elds like supersymmetric nonlinear -models [4]. a next step
to undertake is to formulate supersymmetric gauge theories. we shall do it
in this paper.

the construction of supersymmetric gauge theories is distinguished in
comparison with the previously studied models in several aspects. first

1

of all, there is more structure to reconcile with the fuzziness of the space;
besides the supersymmetry, there is the supergauge symmetry and a need to
build up a complex of superdierential forms on the noncommutative sphere.
secondly, the structure appears very rigid; while in the nonsupersymmetric
context one usually might advocate several nonequivalent constructions, in
the supersymmetric context there seems to be a little room for ambiguities.
thirdly, but not less importantly, it is quite a technical task to study the
supergauge theories. a eld content of these theories is rich and much work
is needed for disentangling good theories from pathological ones by imposing
suitable constraints on the superelds.

as it is well-known [15], the language of dierential forms is the most
natural one for building up the supersymmetric gauge theories. however, the
eld strength obtained by applying the coboundary of the supersymmetric
complex on the gauge eld (a 1-form) cannot be arbitrary but must be,
in general, constrained in a way compatible with supersymmetry. without
those constraints, the incovenience would be much stronger than just an
abundance of additional propagating elds in the theory. one risks rather
the violation of the spin-statistics theorem, presence of terms containing four
bosonic derivatives and similar serious pathologies.

unfortunately, the understanding that the constraints are indispensable
is not sucient for nding them. hitherto there was not found a method
which would lead to an algorithmic identication of the constraints yielding
a good supersymmetric theory. one therefore has to combine an intuition
and a lot of calculation to work out the content of the theory for a given
set of guessed constraints. as we have alluded already above , in our case
additional complications enter the story. indeed, we need to work always with
global description of all involved structures in order to ensure a possibility of
a noncommutative generalization (non-commutative geometry does not know
local charts). thus, we have to nd a suitable globally dened dierential
complex and a set of constraints which would give a good theory.

the guiding principle for seeking the complex which would underlie super-
symmetric gauge theories on the sphere seems clear. one should covariantize
the superderivatives present in an matter action possessing a global sym-
metry to be gauged. if we take the standard superscalar matter [4], those
superderivatives turn out to be a generators of certain superalgebra which
is not osp(2, 1) as one may have expected. what happens is that, though
the resulting supersymmetric theory does turn out to have the osp(2, 1) su-

2

persymmetry , one needs an osp(2, 2) covariant structure to uncover it. the
reason of this can be seen already in the standard case of the at space
(super-poincare) supersymmetry where one has to add to the generators of
supersymmetry (q, q) algebra also the so-called supersymmetric covariant
derivatives (d, d). in the at case the derivatives (d, d) are detached from
the superalgebra (they anticommute with the q-generators) and it is of little
usefulness to remark that the qs and ds form together a n = 2 super-
algebra. however, when we move from the at space to the sphere, it can
be seen ([4]) that the supersymmetric covariant derivatives added to the su-
peralgebra osp(2, 1) entail even an introduction of another bosonic generator
which completes the structure to that of the osp(2, 2) superalgebra. thus
the supersymmetric covariant derivatives are not detached from the super-
symmetry algebra and it is natural and, in fact, inevitable to consider the
bigger structure which involve them.

in what follows, we shall rst introduce an algebra of superfunctions on
the supersphere following [8] and then a dierential complex which will un-
derlie the notion of the supergauge eld. since the theory of representations
of osp(2, 2) is not so notoriously known as that of su(2) we shall review its
basic elements. in section 3, we rst describe the construction of the super-
symmetric schwinger model on the ordinary sphere in a way which is most
probably also original. then we shall give an invariant description of the
complex of the dierential superforms. this invariant description wil not
only render quite transparent the logic of the construction but it will prove
technically ecient in formulating the supersymmetric schwinger model on
the noncommutative sphere.
in fact, formulae which would appear in the
noninvariant formulation in the noncommutative case would be exceedingly
cumbersome. we shal nish with a brief outlook.

2 a dierential complex on the supersphere

2.1 superfunctions on the supersphere

consider the algebra of functions on the complex c 2,1 superplane, i.e. algebra
generated by bosonic variables , ,  = 1, 2 and by fermionic ones a, a.
the algebra is equipped with the graded involution

() = ,

, ( ) = ,

, a = a,

, a = a,

(1)

3

satisfying the following properties

(ab) = (1)abba,

(a) = (1)aa,

(2)

and with the super-poisson bracket

{f, g} = f  g   f g + (1)f +1[af ag + af ag].

(3)

we can now apply the (super)symplectic reduction with respect to a moment
map  + aa  1. the result is a smaller algebra a, that by denition
consists of all functions f with the property

{f, ii + aa  1} = 0.

(4)

moreover, two functions obeying (4) are considered to be equivalent if they
dier just by a product of (  + aa  1) with some other such function.
the smaller algebra a (the reason for using of the subscript  will become
clear soon) is referred to as the algebra of superfunctions on the supersphere
[8]. it is sometimes more convenient to work with a dierent parametrization
of a, using rather the following coordinates

z =

1
2 ,

z =

1
2 ,

b =

a
2 ,

b =

a
2 .

(5)

the poisson bracket (3) then becomes

{f, g} = (1 + zz)(1 + zz + bb)(zf zg  zf zg)

+(1 + zz)bz((1)f zf bg  bf zg) + (1 + zz)bz(bf zg  (1)f zf bg)
(6)

+ (1)(f +1)(1 + zz  bbzz)(bf bg + bf bg).

a natural berezin integral on a can be written as

i[f ] = 

1

42 z d 1  d1  d 2  d2  da  da ( ii + aa  1)f.

it can be rewritten as

i[f ]  

i

2 z dz  dz  db  db

1 + zz + bb

f.

(7)

(8)

(note i[1] = 1.)

now we are ready to quantize the innitely dimensional algebra a with
the goal of obtaining its (noncommutative) nite dimensional deformation.
the quantization was actually performed in [4] using the representation the-
ory of osp(2, 2) superalgebra. here we adopt a dierent procedure, namely
the quantum symplectic reduction (or, in other words, quantization with con-
straints). we start with the well-known quantization of the complex plane
c 2,1. the generators , , a, a become creation and annihilation operators
on the fock space whose commutation relations are given by the standard
replacement

{., .} 

[., .].

(9)

1
h

here h is a real parameter (we have absorbed the imaginary unit into the
denition of the poisson bracket) referred to as the planck constant. ex-
plicitely

[, ] = h,

[a, a]+ = h

(10)

and all remaining graded commutators vanish. the fock space is built up as
usual, applying the creation operators , a on the vacuum |0i, which is in
turn annihilated by the annihilation operators , a. we use here the same
symbols for the classical and quantum quantities with a hope that it will be
always clear from the context which usage we have in mind.

now we perform the quantum symplectic reduction with the moment
map (  + aa). first we restrict the hilbert space only to the vectors 
satisfying the constraint

(  + aa  1) = 0.

hence operators f acting on this restricted space which full

[ f , (  + aa  1)] = 0

(11)

(12)

form our deformed version of a.

the spectrum of the operator (  + aa  1) in the fock space is given
by a sequence nh  1, where ns are integers. in order to full (11) for a
non-vanishing , we observe that the inverse planck constant 1/h must be an
integer n. the constraint (xy) then selects only s living in the eigenspace
hn of the operator (  + aa  1) with the eigenvalue 0. this subspace of

5

the fock space has the dimension 2n +1 and the algebra an of operators(i.e.
supermatrices) f acting on it is (2n + 1)2-dimensional.

when n   (the dimension (2n + 1)2 then also diverges) we have
the planck constant approaching 0 and the algebras an tend to the classical
limit a [4].

the hilbert space hn is naturally graded. the even subspace hen is cre-
ated from the fock vacuum by applying only the bosonic creation operators:

( 1)n1( 2)n2|0i, n1 + n2 = n,

(13)

while the odd one hon by applying both bosonic and fermionic creation
operators:

( 1)n1( 2)n2a|0i, n1 + n2 = n  1.

(14)

at the level of supercomplex plane c 2,1, it is the textbook fact from quan-
tum mechanics that the integral r d ddada (this is the liouville integral
over the superphase space) is replaced under the quantization procedure by
the supertrace in the fock space. (the supertrace is the trace over the in-
dices of the zero-fermion states minus the trace over the one-fermion states).
the  function of the operator (  + aa  1) just restrict the supertrace
to the trace over the indices of hen minus the trace over the indices of hon .
hence an integration in an is given by the formula

i[ f ]  str[ f ],

f  an .

(15)

the graded involution  in the noncommutative algebra an is dened exactly
as in (1).

2.2 osp(2, 1) and osp(2, 2) superalgebras and their rep-

resentations

the osp(2, 2) superalgebra has a convenient basis of even generators r,r3,
and the odd ones v, d, satisfying the following (anti)commutation rela-
tions (see also [16, 4]):

[r3, r] = r,

[r+, r] = 2r3,

[d, v]+ = 0,

[d, v]+ = 

[ri, ] = 0;

(22)

[r3, d] = 

d,

[r, d] = 0,

[r, d] = d;

[, v] = d,

[, d] = v.

here and it what follows the commutators are denoted as [., .] but the anti-
commutators have a subscript [., .]+. we reserve the notation {., .} for poisson
brackets and their noncommutative generalizations (see section 3.2.). if we
take a poisson bracket of two odd elements of a we write {., .}+.

the superalgebra osp(2, 1) is a subsuperalgebra of osp(2, 2) generated
by ri, v. the irreducible representations of osp(2, 1) are classied by one
parameter, which may be a positive integer or a positive half-integer j and
is referred to as the superspin [16]. every irreducible j-representation is of
course a (reducible) representation of the su(2)-subalgebra of osp(2, 1). its
decomposition into the irreducible components from the su(2) point of view
is given by

josp(2,1) = jsu(2)  (j 

)su(2),

(23)

1
2

where jsu(2) means obviously the standard su(2) spin. the only exception
from the rule (23) is a trivial superspin zero representation.

the classication of irreducible representations of osp(2, 2) is more in-
volved [16]. there exist two types of them: the typical and the non-typical
ones. the former are characterized by the property that they are reducible
from the point of view of the osp(2, 1) superalgebra, while the latter are ir-
reducible. the typical representation is characterized by one positive integer
or half-integer josp(2,2)  1 called the osp(2, 2) superspin and by an arbi-
trary complex number  6= 2j which is related to  and may be called a
-spin. the typical representations considered in this paper will have always
the -spin equal to zero. they are 8josp(2,2) dimensional and they have the
following osp(2, 1) content

josp(2,2) = josp(2,1)  (j  1/2)osp(2,1),

(24)

7

hence the following su(2) content

josp(2,2) = jsu(2)  (j  1/2)su(2)  (j  1/2)su(2)  (j  1)su(2).

(25)

the lie superalgebra osp(2, 2) is naturally represented on the (graded)
commutative associative superalgebra a and also on its noncommutative
deformations an . in the commutative case, this representation can be called
hamiltonian since it is generated via the super-poisson bracket (3) by the
following charges

r+ = 12,

r = 21,

r3 =

1
2

( 11  22)  = aa + 1

(26)

2v+ = 1a+a2,

2v = 2aa1,

2d+ = a2 1a,

2d =  2aa1.
(27)

this means that, for instance, v+ acts on an (even) element f  a as

v+f = {v+, f }

(28)

and so on for every generator of osp(2, 2).

in the non-commutative case, the representation of osp(2, 2) is dened by
the same charges (26) and (27) but now thought as the operators acting on
hn via scaled (graded) commutators; for instance, for even f ,

v+f = n[v+, f ],

f  an .

(29)

the explicit form of the supermatrices ri, v, d and  was given in [4] (eqs.
(83)-(91)).

both the commutative algebra a and its noncommutative deformations
an are completely reducible with respect of the osp(2, 2) action described
above. their decompositions into irreducible components involve only the
typical representations and they are given explicitely as follows [4]

an = n

j=0j, a = 

j=0j,

(30)

where j stands for the osp(2, 2) superspin and j = 0 means the trivial rep-
resentation. the representation space of the latter consists of the constant
elements of a and of the constant multiples of the unit supermatrix in the
case of an .

8

the description of the typical multiplet in a or in an with the osp(2, 2)
superspin equal to 1 is easy. in both cases, the commutative and the non-
commutative one, the representation space of this superspin 1 representation
is spanned by the charges ri, , v, d which are considered as the elements of
a and an , respectively. evidently, the osp(2, 2)-superspin 1 representation
coincides with the adjoint representation and its dimension is 8. this fact has
an interesting consequence, namely that the an valued charges provide also
the osp(2, 2) representation with the representation space being hn . this
representation can be showed to be the non  typical irreducible represen-
tation of osp(2, 2) and, as such, it is also the irreducible representation of
osp(2, 1). its osp(2, 1) superspin is given by n/2.

2.3 seeking the complex

we could shortly dene the dierential complex on the supersphere and then
construct the supergauge theories based on it, but before doing that it is
perhaps desirable to indicate the way how this complex was invented. with-
out those indications, the interested reader could check that the construction
gives correct results but possibly he would not be convinced that it is some-
how unique.

suppose therefore that we want to construct supergauge theories with the
underlying superalgebra being osp(2, 1). a natural way to do it consists in
trying to covariantize the derivatives which appear in the action of charged
scalar supereld (we are in two dimension). this action was constructed in
[4] and is explicitly given by

s = i[d+d  dd+ + (1/4)],

(31)

where   a is a complex scalar supereld on the sphere, i is the integral
over a dened in (7) and the derivatives d,  were dened via the poisson
bracket (see (29)). if we add those derivatives to the osp(2, 1) superalgebra
(which acts by means of ri, v) we obtain the osp(2, 2) superalgebra. as
was explained in [4], the using of sole osp(2, 1) generators was insucient for
constructing a theory respecting the spin-statistics theorem.

it seems that our supergauge eld multiplet is composed of three super-
elds a, w which one has to add respectively to three derivatives d,  in
order to covariantize them. the action (31) would then become

s = i[(d+  a+)(d + a)  (d  a)(d+ + a+)

9

+ (1/4)(  w )( + w )].

(32)

however, we shall encounter a big trouble in trying to nd a osp(2, 1) in-
variant eld strength corresponding to gauge multiplet a, w . it seems that
this eld strenght should be given by an expression that contains only the
rst derivatives d,  of the multiplet a, w , for example something like:

f = d+a  da+ + (1/4)w.

(33)

f dened in this way seems to be nice, since it is indeed osp(2, 1) invariant
(for consistency, the multiplet a, w has to transform under the osp(2, 1)
action in the same way as the derivatives d,  which are transformed ac-
cording to (16),(17), (21) and (22)). however, the strength so dened is not
gauge invariant if we impose the evident gauge transformation rule

a  a + id, w  w + i,

(34)

where  is a real scalar supereld.

lets continue our search and suppose that the needed eld strength is not
a osp(2, 1) singlet but it is some multiplet with a higher osp(2, 1) superspin.
however, it is not dicult to show, that no such multiplet exist which would
be linear in the derivatives d,  and would respect the gauge transformation
(34). the same no go theorem can be proved if we add into the game the
derivatives ri, v acting on a, w .

let us therefore add to the superspin 1/2 multiplet a, w a superspin
1 multiplet of superelds ci, b whose gauge transformations are dened as
follows

ci  ci + iri, b  b + iv.

(35)

now it turns out that it exists an osp(2, 1) covariant multiplet of gauge
invariant eld strengths that is linear in the derivatives ri, v, d,  and
in the superelds ci, b, a, w . however, the trouble reappears: rstly, it
seems to be unnatural to have an abundance of new gauge superelds in game
which even do not interact with the matter eld and which enter only the pure
gauge eld sector of the lagrangian. secondly, and even more importantly,
even if we accept that abundance of elds , any polynomial osp(2, 1) invariant
lagrangian built up of that eld strenght leads to a pathological theory
(higher derivatives, violation of spin-statistics etc.).

10

it turns out, however, that even this diculty can be circumvented by
imposing suitable constraints on the supergauge eld multiplet a, w, ci, b
which would eliminate the unwanted superelds. this strategy is, of course,
standard in the superworld but not necessarilly easy. the subtlety consists
in ensuring that dierential constraints in the superspace do not generate
dierential constraints in the bosonic variables on the elds which remain in
the lagrangian. at the same time one has to ensure that the constraints
are compatible with the osp(2, 1) supersymmetry and the supergauge trans-
formations (34) and (35). all these conditions are quite stringent and the
fact that a solution exists even in the noncommutative case indicates the
naturaleness of the compatibility of noncommutative geometry and super-
symmetry.

for seeking the good constraints, we adopt a natural assumption that
the constraints are linear both in the derivatives ri, v, d,  and in the
superelds ci, b, a, w . the condition of the compatibility with the gauge
transformations (34) and (35) selects 32 constraints of that type which fall
into six osp(2, 1) supermultiplets. one of these multiplet has the superspin
1/2, three of them the superspin 1 and two of them the superspin 3/2. the
superspin 1/2 multiplet is nothing but the eld strength mentioned above.
it reads

f = (b  vw  2ra + 2dc  2r3a  2dc3 + 2a;

(36)

f = 4v+a  4va+ + 4db+  4d+b + 2w.

(37)

a tedious (though straightforward) inspection shows that the only viable

constraint is given by the following superspin 1 multiplet, i.e.:

 4d+a+ + c = 0, c3  2da+  2d+a = 0;

b + dw  a = 0.

(38)

(39)

the explicite formulas for the eld strength and the correct constraint will
reappear in the following subsection in terms of the structures of the dif-
ferential complex alluded in the introduction.
it should be clear that the
structure of complex that we are going to construct is implied by our pre-
vious discussion. in other words, we grasp and formalize our search of the
supersymmetric eld strength and the supersymmetric constraints in terms
of that complex.

11

2.4 the complex

we shall describe the dierential complex over the supersphere by working
with the commutative and noncommutative case at the same time. in fact,
whenever we shall consider the commutator in the algebra of an we shall
have in mind the commutator multiplied by n (for n nite) and the poisson
bracket (3) for n = .

we denote the complex by n and we dene it as follows

n = 3

j=0(n )j.

(40)

as usual, the elements of (n )j will be called the j-forms. the spaces (n )j
have the following structure

(n )0 = (n )3 = an ;

(n )1 = (n )2 = 8

i=1(an )i,

(41)

(42)

where (an )i = an for every value of the index i.

generically, we shall denote by small (capital) greek characters the 0-
forms (3-forms) and by capital (small) latin characters the 1-forms (2-forms).
then the associative product  is given by the rules

   = ,   (a, w, ci, b) = (a, w, ci, b);

  (a, w, ci, b) = (a, w, ci, b),    = ;

the multiplication of forms by the scalars from the right is dened as in (43)
and (44) but with  standing from the right. the product of a two form with
a one-form is given as in (46) but with reversed order of the small and the
capital characters. finally, all other products are dened to be zero.

it is important to notice, that a, b are understood as odd elements of
an while ci, w are even (we did not indicate it in (42) in order to avoid too
cumbersome notation). the same is true for a, b and ci, w respectively. 
and  are even . of course, these facts play an important role in checking
that the product (43)-(46) is associative and, in case of n = , also graded
commutative.

the coboundary operator  is given by the rules

(47)

(a, w, ci, b) =

for n nite or via the poisson brackets (3) for n innite.

one easily checks that the coboundary  is nilpotent

2 = 0

and that the  does verify the graded leibniz rule

(  ) =    + (1)  

(51)

(52)

in both commutative (innite n) and noncommutative (nite n) cases.

now we shall give the action of the osp(2, 1) superalgebra on the complex
n . the osp(2, 1) action on the 0-forms is given basically in terms of the odd

13

generators v. the action of the bosonic generators ri can be then derived
in terms of the anticommutators (19) of the odd transformations. on the
0-forms (and 3-forms), we have the following action:

 = (+v+ + v)  (v ).

(53)

here  are constant grassmann parameters and  stands for an innitesimal
variation. the parameters  behave with respect to the graded involution
as follows


+ = ,


 = +.

(54)

note that this is the choice of a real form of osp(2, 1) with respect to the
graded involution and it is dictated by the fact that a 1-form (a, w, ci, b)
must full the following reality conditions

a

+ = a, a

 = b+;

 = a+, b

+ = b, b

c 

+ = c, c 

 = c+, c 

3 = c3, w  = w,

(55)

(56)

in order to yield the correct degrees of freedom of a (super)gauge eld.

the action on the 1-forms (and also on the 2-forms) is given as follows

(a, w, ci, b) =

((v )a+ 

1

w, (v )a +

1

(57)

it can be easily checked that the coboundary  is osp(2, 1) invariant, i.e.

 = ,   n .

(58)

in fact, eq.(58) becomes evident when we introduce the invariant description
of the complex in section 3.2 because the coboundary  will be given in terms
of invariant operators of osp(2, 1). another important property of  is that
it veries the leibniz rule in the complex n , in other words

(1  2) = (1)  2 + 1  (2).

(59)

14

this property enables us to construct the osp(2, 1) invariants. for example,
the product of a 1-form with a 2-form, given by the formula (46), is the
osp(2, 1) scalar. note, however, that the expressions

a+a  aa+ +

and

c+c +

cc+ + c 2

3 + b+b  bb+,

(60)

(61)

are separately osp(2, 1) invariant.

the last things we shall need are the hodge triangle  and the theory of
integration on n . the hodge triangle converts an i-form in to (3  i)-form;
it is dened simply as the identity map between 0 and 3, and 1 and 2,
respectively. the integral i will be dened only on the 3-forms and will be
given by (15) for n nite and by (7) for n innite.

3 field theories

3.1 the commutative case

let us consider rst the pure gauge theories in the commutative case. the
gauge eld will be a 1-form v  n subject to the following constraint

f  v = (., ., ., 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

(62)

in words, the rst three components of the coboundary v are unconstrained
but the remaining ve have to vanish. the reader might have noticed that
under the action of the subalgebra osp(2, 1) a generic 1-form (2-form) decom-
poses into two multiplets. the rst three components form a multiplet with
the osp(2, 1)-superspin 1/2 and the remaining ve with superspin 1. since
the coboundary  commutes with the action  of osp(2, 1), it is evident that
our constraint (62), does respect the osp(2, 1) supersymmetry.

the gauge symmetry of the constraint (62) is also obvious due to the
nilpotency of .
it remains to see whether the constraint involves some
unwanted space derivatives. fortunately, it is not the case. indeed, looking
at (48) it is immediately evident that the constraint is resolved with respect
to the additional superelds c, c3, b:

c = da, c3 = 2da+ + 2d+a, b = dw + a.

(63)

15

if the eld v satises the constraint (62) then the three nonzero components
of the eld strength v will be second order expressions in the derivatives
ri, v, d,  acting on the superspin 1/2 multiplet a, w . this may seem
awkward, since a langrangian quadratic in the eld strength will contain
terms with four derivatives.
it turns out, however, that working out the
action in components of the superelds a, w will give a non-pathological
action. the same phenomenon takes place in the standard (super-poincare)
supersymmetric electrodynamics in two dimensional at space [17] where
the kinetic term of the gauge eld also contains expressions quartic in the
supersymmetric covariant derivatives nevertheless the action in components
is the standard second-order one.

let us write a pure gauge eld action on the commutative supersphere

as follows

s(v ) = i[v  v + v  v ],

v  n .

(64)

where  and  are real parameters and the components of v = (a, w, ci, b)
are supposed to satisfy the reality conditions (55) and (56). it is evident that
the action is gauge invariant with respect to the transformation

v  v + i,

(65)

where  is a 0-form. of course, v is to satisfy the constraint (62), hence the
components ci, b are given by (63). having in mind this, we can evaluate
the coboundary of v :

v = (f+, f, f, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

(66)

where

f = (2 + 2)a  (d + v)w  12dda  12d2

a;

f = 2w + 4(d+d  dd+)w + 4(v+  d+)a  4(v  d)a+. (67)

before giving a noncommutative version of the action (64), let us write

its content in a more familiar parametrization. set

a+ =

1
2

(az a)+

1
2

d+k, a = 

(za+ a)+

1
2

1
2

dk, w = b aba+k,
(68)

16

where d,  were dened in (26) and (27). the components f, f then be-
come

f+ = 

3
2

n[ dda + z dd a + b(d a + da) + d2 a + z d2a]

+ 2d+n( da + d a)  4d+k + 2nd+ ddk  2(d + z d)k;

(69)

f =

3
2

n[z dda  dd a + b(d a + da) + zd2 a  d2a]

+ 2dn( da + d a)  4dk + 2nd ddk  2( d  zd)k;
f = 3n[b( dd a)  b( dda)  2(d a + da) + bd2 a + b d2a]

(70)

2n( da + d a) + 2n ddk + 4(b d + bd)k  4k.

(71)
here n = 1+ zz +bb and the operators d, d are the standard supersymmetric
covariant derivatives in two dimensions, i.e.

d = b + bz,

d = b + bz.

(72)

it is perhaps worth giving formulae that express the derivatives ri, , d, v
in terms of the derivatives d, d and q, q, where

q = b  bz,

q = b  bz.

here they are:

d+ =

1
2

(d  z d), d = 

( d + zd);

1
2

v+ =

1
2

(q + z q),

v =

( q  zq);

1
2

 = bb  bb, r3 = zz  zz +

1
2

bb 

1
2

bb;

r+ = z  z2z  zbb, r = z + z2z + zbb.

(73)

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

using the formulae (46),(68) and (69) -(71), we obtain the action (64) in
terms of a, a, k. the explicit formula is somewhat cumbersome and we do
not list it here since it is pathological! the trouble is caused by the supereld
k that is contained in the action in the form ( ddk)2. this gives the bosonic
derivatives of fourth order. fortunately, there is a manifestly supersymmetric

17

and gauge invariant way for getting rid of the unwanted eld k. indeed, a
constraint

k = 0

(78)

simply does the job. having in mind the noncommutative generalization,
it is desirable to formulate this additional constraint in terms of the elds
a, w . it reads

d+a  da+ +

w = 0.

(79)

1
4

it is not dicult to verify the gauge symmetry (78) or (79) and the osp(2, 1)
supersymmetry of (79).

after imposing the additional constraint (79), the action (64) becomes

s =

1

2i z dzdzdbdb{ d(n)d(n) + n2},

where

 = da + d a, n = 1 + zz + bb

(80)

(81)

and the parameters ,  are linear combinations of , .

it is instructive to see how the osp(2, 1) superinvariance is realized in this

parametrization of the gauge eld multiplet. we have

a = (+v+ + v)a +

 a = (+v+ + v) a 

1
2

ba;

+b a

1
2

and therefore

or, equivalently,

 = (+v+ + v) +

(b  +b),

1
2

(n) = (+v+ + v)(n).

(82)

(83)

(84)

(85)

from the last formula (85), the osp(2, 1) supersymmetry of the action (80)
immediately follows. the gauge symmetry a  a + id, a  a + i d is
also evident.

we are now ready to cast the action (80) in components. set

ia =  + bv +

1
2

b

(w + iu)
1 + zz

+ bb(



1 + zz

 z);

(86)

18

i a =  

1
2

b

(w  iu)
1 + zz

+ bv + bb(



1 + zz

 z ).

(87)

here u, w are real, v and v mutually complex conjugate and  = ,   = .
we calculate

in( da + d a) = iu + b  b + bb[(1 + zz)(zv  z v) +

iu

1 + zz

].

(88)

thus the elds ,  and w have dropped out.

it turns out that an avoiding a mutual coupling of the elds u and v in
the action requires setting  = 2 in the action (80). thus we respect this
most natural choice and write naly

s =



2i z dzdz{(1 + zz)2(zv  z v)2 + zuzu +

u2

(1 + zz)2

+ z + z  + 4



(1 + zz)

}.

(89)

note that the action (89) diers from that of the standard free super-
symmetric electrodynamics in the at euclidean space [17] by the presence
of the mass term for the dynamical elds u and , . the reader may say
that it is not surprising that theories on dierent manifolds have dierent
actions. note, however, that the matter action (32), rewritten in terms of
the superelds a, a and a complex matter supereld , is exactly of the
same form as that of the matter sector of supersymmetric schwinger model
in the at two-dimensional space [17]:

smatter =

1

2i z dzdzdbdb[( d  a)(d + a) + ( d + a)(d  a)]. (90)

of course, this coincidence (due to superconformal invariance of the massless
superscalar matter in two dimensions) is only formal because, in spite of the
same form of the action, the superelds belong to dierent algebras! the
matter supereld  is an element of the algebra of the superfunctions on the
supersphere while in the at case it would be an element of the algebra of
superfunctions on the at euclidean superspace.

19

3.2 an invariant description of the complex

the complex constructed in section 2.4 looks somewhat cumbersome and we
may wonder whether it exists its description which would be more elegant
and natural. it turns out, that the answer to this question is positive; in
fact, we shall present the complex in a way which does not need to choose a
basis in the superalgebra osp(2, 2) or a basis in the space of 1-forms. the in-
variant picture is entirely based on standard structures of super-lie algebras
and it is not only more esthetic but also it is ecient for technical purposes.
indeed, the noncommutative generalization of the commutative theories of
the previous subsection requires adding a quadratic term in the denition
of the eld strength and cubic and quartic terms in the action functional of
the eld theory. consulting the formula (45) the reader may easily convince
himself that working with the product of forms in the previous non-invariant
description would be very messy. however, the invariant picture will enable
us readily to formulate the constraint (62) and even to solve it explicitely!
what is even more remarkable in the story that the complex can be con-
structed for a much general class of lie super-algebras than just osp(2, 2).
here are the details:

denition 1: a super-poisson algebra a = a0  a1 is a z2-graded associa-
tive algebra over the eld of complex numbers c equipped with the structure
of a super-lie algebra with an even (super-poisson) bracket {., .} compatible
with the associative multiplication m : a  a  a; i.e.

{x, y z} = {x, y }z + (1)xy y {x, z}.

(91)

moreover, it is required that a possess an even unit element e such that
ex = xe = x and {e, x} = 0 for all x  a . finally, a is equipped with a
linear superstrace str : a  c, in particular str(e) = 1. the supertrace is
supposed to vanish for poisson brackets: str{x, y } = 0; x, y  a and also
for odd elements: str(a1) = 0.

let us take as an example of a the algebra a of the superfunctions on
the supersphere with the super-poisson bracket given by (3) or (6) and the
supertrace given by the integral (7). another example is the noncommutative
algebra of (2n + 1)  (2n + 1)-supermatrices , denoted as an in section 2.1.
this algebra denes the fuzzy supersphere [4] and it is the noncommutative

20

deformation (or berezin quantization) of the algebra a with the value of
the planck constant h = 1/n.
it should be therefore no surprise that
the lie bracket in an is not just the ordinary commutator inherited from
the associative multiplication in an but the commutator multiplied by n
(playing role of the inverse planck constant):

{x, y } = nm(x  y )  nm(y  x) = n[x, y ], x, y  an .

(92)

the denition of the bracket with this normalization is crucial for verify-
ing normalization of all formulae in this paper, in particular the important
constrain (113). note that we denote the super-lie bracket in an by the
same symbol as in a. the reason is that the former gives the latter in the
commutative limit n  . finally, the supertrace str in an is nothing
but the standard supertrace over (2n + 1)  (2n + 1)-supermatrices. it is
evident from (13) and (14), that str is correctly normalized, which means
that the str of the unit supermatrix is equal to 1.

denition 2: we say that (a, g) is a supersymmetric double over a super-
poisson algebra a, if g = g0  g1 is a super-lie subalgebra of a (but not
necessarilly the associative subalgebra of a!) and a bilinear form str  m
restricted to g is non-degenerate.
in this case the bilinear form str  m
determines an element c g  g  g called a quadratic casimir element of the
double (a, g).

now we construct a canonical complex (a, g) over the double (a, g) as

follows

where

(a, g) = 3

i=0i(a, g),

(93)

0(a, g) = 3(a, g) = (ap )0  e  (ap )0,

1(a, g) = 2(a, g) = (g0  (ap )0)  (g1  (ap )1).

(94)

here the notation ap means that one does not consider the algebra a over
the eld c but one replaces c by a graded commutative algebra p . the
subscript 0 in (ap )0 (1 in (ap )1) then means that one considers only a
subspace of ap which consists of all elements of ap even (odd) with respect
to the sum of gradings of a and of p .

21

note: considering the algebra a over p instead over the eld of complex
numbers c is not an useless complication, but it is dictated by the eld
theoretical applications. for instance, any element f (z, z, b, b)  a can be
expanded in the taylor series in b, b. the term proportional to b is of the
form (z, z)b. but (z, z), being a fermion, is not a c-valued function ! it
should be grassmann-valued which means that it should be valued in odd
part p1 of some z2-graded commutative algebra p . all this is the standard
supersymmetric story so we do not give more details here.

in order (a, g) be a complex we need to introduce a coboundary op-
erator g : i(a, g)  i+1(a, g) such that (g)2 = 0 and an associative
product g : i(a, g)  j(a, g)  i+j(a, g) compatible with g. by the
compatibility we mean, of course, the leibniz rule

g(x ig y j) = gx ig y j +(1)ix ig gy j, x i  i(a, g), y j  j(a, g).
(95)
in order to give a simple description of g and g, we note that a  a
naturally acts on itself in one of four ways: mm,mad,adm and adad;
e.g.for x, y  a we have

xmad(y )  (1)y (1)x(2)

x (1)y (1)  {x (2), y (2)},

(96)

where x = x (1)  x (2) and y = y (1)  y (2). now we dene g as follows,

gx 0 = c g

madx 0;

gx 1 = c g

adadx 1 +

1
2

dgx 1;

gx 2 = adx 2  {x 2(1), x 2(2)};

gx 3 = 0,

(97)

(98)

(99)

(100)

where x i  i(a, g) and dg is a dynkin number which can be dened by
the relation

str(xy ) =

str(adxady ).

(101)

1
dg

22

here str is the superstrace over supermatrices in adjoint representation of
the lie superalgerba g. the multiplication g is given by the following table

x i g y j

y 0

y 1

x 0
x 1
x2
x 3

m  m
ad  m

m  m
m  m

(102)

for example,

or

x 1 g y 1 = x 1

adm(y 1),

x 1 g y 2 = (1)y (1)x(2)

x 1(2)y 2(2)str(x 1(1)y 2(1)).

(103)

(104)

denition 3: we say that (a, g, h) is a supersymmetric triple, if it exists
a subspace h of a such that
1) h is a super-lie subalgebra of g;
2) (a, h) is the supersymmetric double with the casimir element c h 
h  h, coboundary h and product h;
3) an element c  c g  c h fulls m(c)  ce;
4) ad(h  h)  h, where h is an orthogonal complement of h in g
with respect to str  m.

now we construct a canonical complex (a, g, h) over the triple (a, g, h)

as follows

where

(a, g, h) = 3

i=0i(a, g, h),

(105)

0(a, g, h) = 3(a, g, h) = (ap )0  e  (ap )0,

1(a, g, h) = 2(a, g, h) = (g0  (ap )0)  (g1  (ap )1).

(106)

we dene the exterior derivative  on (a, g, h) as follows,

x 0 = gx 0,

x 2 = gx 2,

x 3 = gx 3;

(107)

where x i  i(a, g, h) and x 1
g  a into h  a.

x 1 = gx 1  hx 1
h,

(108)
h means the orthogonal projection of x 1 from

23

a product  in (a, g, h) is dened by the same table as the product g

in (a, g), except of the multiplication of 1-forms where we have

x 1  y 1 = x 1 g y 1  x 1

h h y 1
h.

(109)

it is straightforward exercise to check that the product  and the coboundary
 verify the leibniz rule.

3.3 noncommutative supersymmetric electrodynamics

suppose that the super-poisson algebra a is such that its lie bracket {., .}
is derived from its associative multiplication i.e., as an n-multiple of its
commutator like in (92). then a noncommutative pure supersymmetric elec-
trodynamics over a is a theory of 1-forms in the triple complex (a, g, h)
dened by an action

s =

1
g2 str[  f  f + (v  v +

2
3

v  v  v )],

(110)

where

f  v + v  v

(111)

is the eld strength of v , , two real parameters (cf. (64)), g a coupling
constant and the hodge triangle  is the identity map between 1(a, g, h)
and 2(a, g, h). moreover, v is considered to be a real 1-form v  = v
subject to two constraints

(v + v  v )h = 0

(112)

and

c  vh + vh  c +

1
n

 vh  vh = 0.

(113)

here vh means the orthogonal projection of v to h and c is viewed as a
2-form. the graded star  on the complex is dened by means of the graded
star  on the algebra a. for example,

(x 1) = (x 1(1))  (x 1(2)), x 1  1(a, g, h).

(114)

the action s and both constraints are invariant with respect to

24

1) gauge transformations

v  uv u 1  (u)u 1, u 1 = u ;

(115)

2) h-supersymmetry1, where h  h acts on (a, g, h) as follows

h(x 0,3) = ad(h  x 0,3);

h(x 1,2) = (e  h)madx 1,2 + (h  e)admx 1,2.

(116)

(117)

the constraint (v + v  v )h = 0 can be solved explicitely, thanks to the
assumption (4) in the denition of the supersymmetric triple (a, g, h) (the
assumption (3) is needed for the gauge invariance of the constraint (113)).
the solution reads

vh =

2

dh  dg

(cadadvh + vh  vh).

(118)

thus we insert vh from (118) into (110) and we obtain a theory containing
only 1-forms vh.

an interaction with matter can also be expressed in terms of the complex

(a, g, h). let  be a complex 0-form, then

smatter = str[((g  h + vh))  (g  h + vh)].

(119)

if we add smatter to s in (110) we obtain the h-supersymmetric schwinger
model over the poisson algebra a.

for the commutative resp. noncommutative fuzzy supersphere (a = a
resp. a = an ) and the superalgebras h = osp(2, 1) and g = osp(2, 2),
the complex (a, g, h) is isomorphic to the complex  resp. n of the
section 2.4. we present few formulae connecting the two presentations of
the same complex. first of all the algebras g and h are generated by the
hamiltonians (26) and (27) in both commutative and noncommutative cases.
in what follows, the parameter n will stand for either a nite integer (the
noncommutative case) or  (the commutative one). thus

vh = +2d  a+  2d+  a 

1
2

  w  (a+, a, w, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0); (120)

1we mean here the real form of h-superalgebra which respects the reality of the 1-form

v ; cf. (54).

25

f = +2d  f+  2d+  f 

1
2

  f  (f+, f, f, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);

(121)

c = +2d  d+  2d+  d 

  ;

dg =

4

1 + 1/n

,

dh =

1
2
6

.

1 + 1/n

(122)

(123)

note also that c  = c and the condition v 
h = vh does indeed reproduce
the reality conditions (55) and (56). it is trivial to check that the conditions
3) and 4) of the denition 3 are indeed fullled. for this, one uses the
relations (26)-(27), (122) and (16) -(22).

the main message of this paper is that the schwinger model formulated
in this section for nite n becomes in the limit n   the standard commu-
tative supersymmetric theory of section 3.1. in particular, the actions (110)
and (119) become (64) and (90) respectively and the constraints (112) and
(113) become (62) and (79) in this limit. moreover, the gauge transformation
(115) becomes the gauge transformation (34) and (35) and the supersymme-
try transformations (116) and (117) become the transformations (53) and
(57).
it is in this sense that we consider the theory for nite n as the
nonperturbative regularization of the standard commutative theory.

note the presence of the expressions like v + v  v in our theory which
are characteristic for non-abelian gauge theories. they appear because of
the noncommutativity of the fuzzy sphere, but in the commutative limit the
terms like v  v disappear and we are left with the abelian theory. in fact,
the coboundary  commute only with one parametric subgroup of the gauge
group, consisting of the elements of the form u = exp (i)e where e is the unit
element of a. this is another sign that we deal with the noncommutative
deformation of an u(1) gauge theory. the reader might appreciate also the
economy of using the invariant formulation for writing the action functionals.
in fact, the already cumbersome formulae of section 3.1, which are written
in the noninvariant language, would be even much more cumbersome in the
noncommutative case due to the presence of the v  v terms.

4 conclusions and outlook

we have constructed the supersymmetric schwinger model on the noncom-
mutative sphere. the theory possess only nite number of degrees of freedom

nevertheless it is manifestly supersymmetric and supergauge invariant. the
basic structural ingredient of the construction of the model is the complex
(a, g, h) for g = osp(2, 2) and h = osp(2, 1). it is remarkable that the
complex can be constructed for large class of superalgebras hence we expect
that supergauge theories could be in a similar fashion constructed for higher
dimensional projective spaces. it is also not dicult to suggest a generaliza-
tion to more general gauge groups than u(1), however, due to the amount of
work necessary for doing it we prefer to postpone it for a later publication.
note nally that 1-forms in (a, g) can be interpreted as 1-cochains in
the lie superalgebra cohomology but 1-forms in (a, g, h) are not relative
cochains modulo h. this suggests that it may exists an interesting variant
of the lie superalgebra cohomology of g with respect to h.
