abstract

thermodynamics of d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills theory is studied with
particular attention on perturbative expansion at weak t hooft coupling regime and inter-
polation to strong coupling regime thereof. non-ideal gas eect to free-energy is calculated
and found that leading- and next-to-leading-order corrections contribute with relative opposite
signs. pade approximant method is adopted to improve xed-order, perturbative series and is
found to decrease free-energy monotonically as t hooft coupling parameter is increased. this
may be regarded as an indication of smooth interpolation of thermodynamics between weak
and strong t hooft coupling regimes, as suggested by maldacenas ads/cft correspondence.

introduction

maldacenas proposal [1] relates large n limit of the d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric su(n)
yang-mills theory to type iib superstring theory on ads5  s5. according to the correspon-
dence, parameters of yang-mills and string theories are related each other as:

g2
ym = 2gst ,

g2
ymn =

1
2

r4
2 ,

where r is the curvature radii of both ads5 and s5, and gst and  are string coupling parameter
and string slope parameter, respectively. exploration of the proposed duality over the entire
parameter space (g2
ym, n) is seemingly a formidable, if not impossible, task. however, the
above relation already implies that physics of super yang-mills theory in the strong t hooft
coupling limit, 2  g2
ymn  , is directly accessible from systematic expansion in the zero-
slope limit, (/r2)  0, of type iib string theory, viz. gauged ads5 supergravity. indeed,
all the checkpoints regarding the duality examined so far have been exclusively in this limit.
it is therefore of interest to explore, for various physical quantities, the maldacenas proposal
beyond the leading order in strong t hooft coupling in super yang-mills theory and in (/r2) in
gauged ads5 supergravity. of particular interest is whether the physical quantity is an analytic
function over the entire parameter space. if so, it would be interpolating smoothly between
weak and strong coupling regimes. in this paper, as an example of such physical quantities, we

would like to investigate thermodynamic free-energy density f (n, ), with particular attention
to the issue of interpolation between weak and strong t hooft coupling regimes. the issue is
particularly relevant, as, based on certain assumptions on analyticity and convergence of the

perturbative series, it has been claimed that such a smooth interpolation is not possible [2].

in the strong t hooft coupling limit, the free-energy density has been calculated in [3],

including leading-order correction. their calculation goes as follows. according to the malda-
cenas proposal extended to nite temperature, super yang-mills theory at high temperature
t is described, in large n and strong t hooft coupling limit, by a schwarzschild ads5 black
hole [4] at hawking temperature t . the metric of the black hole is given by

ds2 =

u2

r2 (cid:16)f (u)dt2 + dx2

||(cid:17) +

r2

u2 (cid:16)f 1(u)dr2 + u2d2
5(cid:17) ,

(1)

where, expressed in terms of yang-mills paramters, the schwarzschild factor f (u) is given by

f (u) =  1 

u4
0

u4! ,

u0 = 2t .

as shown in [3], the metric eq.(1) turns out to be a solution of gauged ads5 supergravity equa-
tions of motion not only at leading-order (einstein-hilbert action) but also including o(3)

1

string correction terms. the free-energy density f is then obtained from the euclidean super-
gravity action of the black hole times hawking temperature t . the result is

f (n, t ) = h()(cid:18)

h() = (cid:20) 3

and hence indicates that the free-energy density is diminished by a factor h()  3/4 compared
to the free-energy of ideal gas of n = 4 super yang-mills theory, 2/6  n 2t 4. branch-cut
of the free-energy density at  =  is a genuine prediction for the strong coupling limit,
along with the heavy quark potential, both at zero [5, 6] and nite temperatures [7, 8, 9], and

anomalous dimensions of long supermultiplets [10, 11].

were it interpolating smoothly over the entire t hooft coupling parameter space, the func-
tion h() in eq.(2) is expected to make monotonic cross-over between h(  0)  1 and
h(  )  3/4. to examine whether this is the case, in this paper, we calculate the
free-energy density of the super yang-mills theory in xed-order perturbative expansion and
examine its behavior as  is increased. according to our calculation, the leading-order o(2)
correction indeed makes h() decreasing, but the next-order, non-analytic o(3) correction
contributes with (relative) opposite sign. the result up to this order then seems not to exhibit
anticipated monotonically interpolating behavior, but it may have to do with truncation of the

perturbation expansion to lower order terms. in an attempt to improve the xed-order pertur-
bation theory and (partially) resum higher-order terms, we have employed pade approximant
method. our result shows that, once pade-improved, the function h() indeed becomes mono-

tonically decreasing as it is extrapolated to larger values of the t hooft coupling parameter.
interestingly enough, the (relative) opposite sign of the o(3) correction turns out precisely
the origin of the monotonically decreasing behavior after the pade approximant is made.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we present perturbative calculation of

the free-energy density of d = 4, n = 4 super yang-mills theory up to o(3).
in section
3, we improve the xed-order perturbative result of section 2 by pade approximant method

and nd smooth interpolation plausible.
in section 4, we conclude with brief discussion on
interpolation of free-energy density between d = 2, n = 4 supersymmetric su(n1)  su(n5)
yang-mills theory and type iib supersring theory on ads3. preliminary results of the present
paper has been announced by one of the authors (sjr) in [12]. since then, while our paper
is being prepared, two independent works dealing with aspects of the calculation in section 2
up to o(2) [13] and o(3) [14] have been reported. wherever overlapping, our results are in
complete agreement with theirs.

2 perturbative calculation of free-energy

in this section, we will be computing free-energy of four-dimensional super yang-mills theory
with n = 4 supersymmetry and gauge group g = su(n) up to o(g3
ym) in large-n limit.
throughout the computation, we will adopt feynman gauge and use dimensional regularization
for ultraviolet divergences. in component elds, the n = 4 super yang-mills theory consists of
a gauge boson, four majorana fermions and three complex scalars in the adjoint representation

of the gauge group g.

resented by wiggly lines, ghosts by dotted lines, fermions by solid lines, and scalars by dashed
lines.

at leading order, o(g0

ym), the free energy density f1 is simply that of the non-interacting
massless degrees of freedom and is obtained from one-loop feynman diagrams, as shown in
fig.1 for gauge bosons, ghosts, gaugino and three adjoint fermions, and three adjoint scalars,

respectively. evaluating each diagram explicitly, one obtains

comparison with eq.(3) shows that the perturbative expansion is indeed in powers of the t
hooft coupling parameter 2  g2
ymca. note that, at zero temperature, b0 = f0 and b = f
and hence bosonic and fermionic contributions in eqs.(3), (5) are cancelled out, manifesting the

supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorem for the vacuum energy. for g = su(n), where
dg = n 2  1 and ca = n, the results eqs.(3), (5) are in agreement with [13, 14].

in the xed-order perturbative expansion, the next order would be of o(g4

ym), coming from
three-loop feynman diagrams. however, as is well-known, (a subset of) these diagrams are
aicted with severe infrared divergences associated with the exchange of electrostatic gauge

bosons and scalars. physically, these infrared divergences are screened by debye plasma screen-
ing. the screening of gauge bosons and scalars can be taken into account by a resummation

of so-called ring diagrams to all orders [15, 16]. the innite-order resummation is the ori-
ym)3/2. an ecient way to calculate
gin of the non-analytic contribution starting at order (g2
the non-analytic term is to reorganize the xed-order, perturbative expansion by rewriting the
lagrangian as [17]

and to treat the second term as perturbative interactions. here, mel is the electric thermal mass
for the gauge boson given by the one-loop self-energy  at zero momentum 3, m 2
00(0),
and mel is the thermal mass for scalars calculated from m2
elab = ab(0). self-energy diagrams
in fig. 3 can be evaluated straightforwardly in the zero-momentum limit, much as was done in
computation of eq. (4). the result is

elab = ab

rather than presenting details of straightforward but tedious calculation, , we briey discuss

3a nonzero thermal mass is generated for a0, but not for ai. this stems from the fact that, after dimensional

how o (g3

the rst term is the well-known, black-body radiation eect of the massless scalar particles.
its exerts a positive radiation pressure and hence a negative contribution to the free-energy.

the second term is the eect of nonzero mass; it contributes positively to the free energy, as
expected on physical ground. the third term, which gives rise to a negative correction, may be
understood as representing the bosonic nature of the particle 4. its contribution is of o(m3),
thus cannot be obtained in a naive perturbative expansion in powers of m2. if one interprets
the mass m as the thermal mass due to the debye plasma screening, eq.(6), then eq.(7) may
be understood as an expansion with respect to the coupling (g2

simply because the thermal mass mel is dened in such a way that it precisely reproduces the
resummed g3
ym order contributions
from individual two-loop diagrams fig. 2, they are all cancelled out by the corresponding mass

therefore, on general ground, the o(g3

ym) contribution due to debye plasma screening
contributes negatively to the free-energy (viz. positive contribution to the radiation pressure),
independent of the details of the theory under consideration and can be read from eq.(7) once
the thermal masses are calculated. incidentally, extra terms of order g2
ym in eq.(7) are also
cancelled out by the mass counterterms given in fig. 4, and have no net contribution, as should

be so for consistency of the perturbative expansion.

the next order correction to eq.(9) will be of order g4
ym and can be calculated by considering
three-loop diagrams. moreover, a full account of the debye screening at three loop order would
produce terms of order g2
ym. these contributions can be evaluated by utilizing
methods developed in refs. [17], [18]. on the other hand, extending perturbative evaluation
of the free-energy density to even higher orders breaks down beginning at order g6
ym. this is
mainly due to another source of infrared problems associated with exchange of magnetostatic
gluons. screening of the magnetostatic gluons cannot be achieved by resummation of the

ym and g5

ym ln g2

perturbative diagrams and, as the eect is inherently nonperturbative, can only be treated
using a reliable method such as lattice simulation [16]. as the new infrared divergence appears
beginning at order g6
ymt .
rather than dwelling on estimates of these eects further, one might like to explore implica-

ym, by scaling analysis, the magnetic screening mass scale is of order g2

tion of the result eq.(9) to the behavior of the perturbative free-energy as the t hooft coupling
parameter  becomes large. in particular, one would like to study if the free-energy at weak
coupling regime eq.(9) may possibly be interpolated monotonically to that at strong coupling
regime eq.(2) obtained via ads5 supergravity. on a rst look, as  is increased, the positive
sign of g3
ym term seems to indicate that the result eq.(9) at weak coupling regime behaves
against any smooth interpolation to strong coupling regime. however, it might well have to
do with the nature of the xed-order perturbation theory, which truncates physical quantities

to nite-order polynomials and induce uctuating behavior. certainly, if possible at all, one
needs to improve the perturbative result eq.(9) before any denite conclusion is drawn.

replacement of the xed-order perturbation series by pade approximant [19] may be con-
sidered as a simple tool of gaining an idea on how the series would behave as the coupling
parameter is increased. indeed, the pade approximant of qcd and other eld theories, which
has been applied already to high-energy processes [20] quite successfully 6, seems to improve
convergence of the perturbative free-energy in the right direction [21]. we will thus apply the
pades approximant to the perturbative free-energy density of the n = 4 super yang-mills
theory and examine whether the approach lead to monotonic interpolation between weak and

strong coupling regimes.

let us write eq. (9) as

r() 

f (, t )

f ( = 0, t )

= 1 + f22 + f33 +    ,

(10)

where, from eq.(9), f2 = 3/22 and f3 = (3 + 2)/3, respectively. note that, as it stands,
r() exhibits a minimum at  = (2f2/3f3), viz. g2
ymn  0.5. the general form of the pade

(11)

the coecients cn and dl are functions of xed-order coecients f1, f2,  . as the two coef-
cients f1 and f2 are determined, it is possible to construct two distinct pade approximants,
which reproduce eq.(10) up to order of 3:

we have plotted the two pade approximants in fig. 5 and have made comparison with
the perturbative result. note that, thanks to the fact that f3 is positive, both forms of the

9

pade approximant show monotonically decreasing behavior as the t hooft coupling parameter
becomes strong. this is to be contrasted with the behavior of the xed-order perturbative
result, in which the strong coupling behavior is dominated by the f3g3
ym term. hence, within
the simple pade-improvement of the perturbation series, we have obtained a behavior consistent
with the strong coupling expansion drawn from the ads5 supergravity analysis and hence with
smooth interpolation between weak and strong coupling regimes.

although the pade approximant would not be able to draw any denite conclusion regarding

the strong coupling behavior, at least one can say that the positive contribution of the f3g3
ym
term to the free-energy density is not as disastrous as it may appear for a smooth interpolation
over the t hooft coupling parameter space. explicit calculation of higher-order g4
and g5

ym might be helpful in drawing more denitive conclusion on this issue.

4 remark on d1+d5 and ads3 black hole free-energy

finally, we would like to bring up an issue regarding another interesting conguration exhibit-
ing ads/cft correspondence: a bound-state of n1 d1-branes and n5 d5-branes. eective
description of the conguration is controlled by t hooft coupling parameters, g2
ymn5.
at strong coupling limit, the bound-state of extremal d1-d5 brane is described by type
iib string on ads3  s3  t 4. an important observation of [3] was that the geometry is not
modied even if the d1-d5 branes become non-extremal. this is because of the fact that the

ymn1 , g2

strong coupling expansion (viz.
in inverse powers of the two t hooft coupling parameters)
is expressed in power-series of weyl curvatures and that the weyl curvature vanishes for a
product of ads3 and s3 for equal radii of curvature. this implies that the free-energy density
of the schwarzschild ads3 black hole (btz black hole) is given, to all orders in strong coupling
expansion, by

f = n1n5t 2 ,
viz. independent of the t hooft coupling parameters.

(14)

at weak coupling limit, the d1-d5 brane conguration is described by d = 2 n = 4
supersymmetric yang-mills theory with gauge group su(n1)  su(n5) and bi-fundamental
matters [22]. higgs-branch of the theory is described by four goldstone bosons living on
an eectively n1n5 times bigger spatial volume. thus, thermodynamic free-energy may be
calculated in terms of sigma model of the four goldstone bosons. at leading order in derivative

expansion, the free-energy density ought to be given by

f = 4 (cid:18)


4

t 2(cid:19)  n1n5 +    ,

(15)

where the ellipses denote corrections from higher-order interaction terms of the sigma model.

10

the leading-order term in eq.(15) matches with the exact result of eq.(14), so if the free-
energy density were to interpolate monotonically between weak and strong coupling regimes, the

free-energy density eq.(15) should be also an exact result of perturbative expansion in powers of
t hooft coupling parameters. this implies that, in thermodynamics of d = 2 super yang-mills
theory, there exists a curious non-renormalization theorem (not related to supersymmetry). we
suspect this may have to do with subtle noncommutativity between t hooft limit, n1, n5 
, and thermodynamic innite volume limit, v  , in two dimensional gauge theories.
whether this is indeed the case would serve as an interesting checkpoint to the generality of
the anticipated interpolation. work along this direction is in progress and will be reported
