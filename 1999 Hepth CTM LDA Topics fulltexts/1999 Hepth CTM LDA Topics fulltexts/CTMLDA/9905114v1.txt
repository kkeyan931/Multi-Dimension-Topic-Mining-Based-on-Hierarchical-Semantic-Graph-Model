abstract

the shannon sampling theorem is generalized for signals with arbitrarily
varying bandwidth and non-equally spaced sampling. the sampling kernel is
expressed explicitly in terms of the bandwidth. it is shown that such signals are
equivalent to elds on certain spaces with an ultraviolet cuto. this includes a
type of short-distance structure which has been discussed for space-time at the
planck scale in the context of string theory and quantum gravity.

the shannon sampling theorem describes a useful property of signals whos frequency
spectrum is bounded. the theorem asserts that in order to record a signal with band-
width max it is sucient to measure the signal at discrete and equidistant points in
time, tn, with spacing s = tn+1  tn = 1/2max, where n runs through all integers.
the shannon sampling formula then allows the reconstruction of the signal (t) at all
times t from its sampled values (tn):

(t) = xn

sin [2 max (t  tn)]

2 max (t  tn)

(tn)

(1)

the lattice of sampling times {tn} can be chosen arbitrarily from the one-parameter
family {tn()} of all those sampling lattices which have the required spacing s, namely
tn() =  + n/2max.
the ability to recover a continuous curve from its values at discrete sampling points
has found applications ranging from pure mathematics, where it may e.g. be used to
derive series expansions of functions, to the experimental sciences and engineering,
where it is used, e.g., in digital-analog conversion. various generalizations of the sam-
pling theorem have been worked out and standard references are, e.g., [1]. for recent
work see, e.g., [2, 3, 4] and references therein.

in the present paper, the aim is to improve sampling eciency by using time-varying
sampling rates to sample classes of signals with a time-varying bandwidth.
in the
literature, several methods of non-equally spaced sampling are known, in particular,
gaussian and lagrangian interpolation, interlaced sampling, or kramers, papoulis
or paley-wieners sampling theorems, see, e.g., [1, 2]. these, however, are either
specialized or do not provide a direct handle on the time-varying bandwidth. the
sampling theorem which we develop here allows the use of arbitrarily varying sampling
rates to sample signals with a corresponding directly specied time-varying bandwidth.
the present work arose, unexpectedly, from investigations into the possible short-
distance structures of space-time at the planck scale, see e.g.
indeed, one
of the main ndings of the present paper is that classes of signals with time-varying
bandwidth are mathematically equivalent to elds on ultraviolet-regular spaces of the
type fuzzy-a in terms of the classication presented in [6].

[5, 6].

the generalized sampling theorem

we begin by noting that there are consistency conditions which restrict the choice of
bandwidth curve max(t). intuitively, this is because the bandwidth max(t), by posing
a limit on how much signals can vary around time t, also poses a limit on how much
the bandwidth max(t) itself can vary around time t. more precisely, we will nd that
|d/dt max(t)| < 4 max(t)2.
indeed, the bandwidth and its derivative at a certain
discrete set of times, n, already determine the bandwidth curve max(t) for all t:

in order to specify a class of signals we rst choose data {tn} to dene the bandwidth
curve max(t) at the discrete set of times n = (tn + tn+1)/2, i.e. at the center of each
lattice interval, as the inverse of the spacing:

max(n) =

1

2 (tn+1  tn)

(2)

secondly, we also specify the bandwidths derivative, dmax/dt(n), at the times n.
to this end, a natural parametrization will be in terms of variables {t

n}, as:

d
dt

(3)

max(n) =  4 max(n)2 (t

n+1  t
n)
(t
n+1 + t
n)
due to consistency constraints, the choice of data {tn} and {t
n}, i.e. the choice of
max(t) and d/dt max(t) at the discrete times n = (tn + tn+1)/2 already determines
the bandwidth curve max(t) for all t.
the main result of the present paper is the theorem that signals of the class with
bandwidth max(t) can be recovered for all t from their values sampled at the times
{tn} through the sampling formula

(t) = xn

g(t, tn) (tn)

(4)

2

with the sampling kernel g(t, tn):

g(t, tn) = (1)z(t,tn) t

n

t  tn  xm

t
m

(t  tm)2!1/2

(5)

here, (1)z(t,tn) provides a sign factor such that g(t, tn) is dierentiable in t, namely,
z(t, tn) is the number of sampling points ti in the interval [t, tn] if t < tn or the number
of ti in the interval [tn, t] if tn < t, and z = 0 if tn = t.
the same class of signals can be sampled also on any other lattice, say {tn}, for which
kr,s = (g( tr, ts))r,s is invertible. the sampling formula then reads:

(t) = xn,m

g(t, tn) k 1

n,m (tm)

(6)

the conditions on the choice of the data {tn} and {t
all n, and |tn|   for n  + and/or for n  , and

n} are tn+1 > tn, and t

n > 0 for

t

(7)

reducing the sampling problem to a problem in functional analysis
let us reconsider the class of signals with constant bandwidth max, dened as con-
sisting of all signals (t) whos fourier transform (w) is strictly bandlimited, i.e. for
which there is a 0() < max so that () = 0 for all || > 0() (and whos derivative
d/d () is square integrable).
we observe that, if (t) obeys the bandlimit, so does t(t). this is because the
fourier transform of the multiplication operator t : t (t) = t(t) is the dierentiation
operator, whos action changes the support of the spectrum only innitesimally. based
on this observation it is possible to dene the same class of bandlimited signals without
referring to the signals fourier transform, namely as the representation of the operator
t on the space of functions for which the scalar product

h1|2i := xn

1(tn()) 2(tn())

(8)

is independent of . here, {tn()} is the family of sampling lattices with spacing s, as
dened above. choosing the spacing s of the sampling lattices {tn()} is equivalent to
choosing the bandwidth max, through max = 1/2s. clearly, multiplying a signal (t)
with the time variable, (t)  t(t), always aects the bandwidth of the signal only
innitesimally, independently of the chosen bandwidth. this fact can be used for the
denition of time-varying bandwidths:

we dene a class of signals with time-varying bandwidth as the representation
of the multiplication operator t on the space of functions (t) for which the scalar
product eq.8 is independent of , with respect to a family {tn()} of lattices with

3

time-varying spacings. we will nd that for all admissible {tn()} the lattice spacing
is a well-dened function of time, s(t), and this will allow us to dene the band-width
curve as max(t) := 1/2s(t). our denition coincides with the usual characterization
of the band-width as the width of the fourier spectrum whenever the usual character-
ization is applicable, i.e. whenever the bandwidth is locally approximately constant.
technically, the -independence of the scalar product implies the existence of isome-
tries, g, between the l2-hilbert spaces over each of the lattices of the family {tn()}.
thus, our denition characterizes a class of signals as the set of (t) which obey the
equations

(tm()) = xn
tm() (tm()) = xn

g(tm(), tn()) (tn()),

g(tm(), tn()) tn() (tn())

(9)

(10)

for all , . eqs.9,10 also determine g, which is the sampling kernel: for all t which
occur in the family of lattices, eq.9 expresses the signal (t) in terms of its values
(tn()), sampled at (any choice of) sampling lattice {tn()}.
however, consistency conditions on the possible time-dependence of the bandwidth are
to be expected and indeed, not for all choices of families of lattices {tn()} do eqs.9,10
possess solutions g and . we will nd that each admissible family of sampling lattices
{tn()} will already be determined by giving one sampling lattice, say {tn} = {tn(0)},
and its derivative {t
n} are the input data to the
sampling theorem above.
to see the underlying mathematical structure, consider the operator t in the closure
of its complexied domain dt , the hilbert space h = dt .

n} = {d/d tn()|=0}. the {tn},{t

t , on its domain dt is clearly a symmetric operator, i.e.

h|t|i  ir for all
|i  dt . however, t is not self-adjoint, not even on any invariant subspace, i.e.
t is simple symmetric. assume, e.g., some signal t0(t)  dt is eigenvector to the
eigenvalue t0, i.e. that t t0(t) = tt0(t) = t0t0(t). then t0(t) = 0 for all t 6= t0.
thus, t0(t) vanishes on all but one lattice. the scalar product can be evaluated,
equivalently, on each lattice, thus t0(t) = 0 for all t. clearly, the adjoint, t , has one
(up to phase) nondegenerate and normalized eigenvector |ti  h for each t.
this reduces the sampling problem to the study of simple symmetric operators whos
self-adjoint extensions have purely discrete, nondegenerate spectra and thus deciency
indices (1, 1). since t is simple symmetric with equal deciency indices we are indeed
describing an example of a fuzzy-a geometry in the terminology of [6].

the indices (1, 1) imply that there exists a u(1)- family of self-adjoint extensions
t () of t , yielding a family of eigenbases {|tn()i}. using that the identity in the
hilbert space can be resolved in each of these eigenbases, the sampling theorem now
becomes the insertion of a resolution of the identity into the scalar product (t) = ht|i
(11)

ht|i = xn

ht|tn()i htn()|i

4

with the sampling kernel being g(t, tn()) = ht|tn()i.
all admissible families of lattices {tn()} will be found parametrizable such that the
tn() are dierentiable, strictly monotonically increasing functions of , obeying, say,
tn( + 2) = tn+1(), and, while each lattice may be semibounded, each family covers
all of ir. the strict monotonicity of the tn() implies that, for a given family {tn()},
there is exactly one lattice interval centered around each point t. let us denote the
length of this interval by s(t). through s(t), we dene the time-varying bandwidth as
max(t) := 1/2s(t). vice versa, given max(t), the family {tn()} can be reconstructed,
up to trivial reparametrization of . eq.3 and the bound |d/dt max(t)| < 4 max(t)2
follow from ds(t)/dt = ds/d (dt/d)1.
we remark that we here obtain one-parameter resolutions of the identity in terms of
an overcomplete and continuously parametrized set of normalizable vectors,

1 =

1

2 z 2

0

dxn |tn()ihtn()| =

1

2 z dt

d
dt |tiht|

while coherent states and wavelets, see e.g. [8], are typically characterized, analogously,
by two-parameter resolutions of the identity.

proof of the sampling theorem
our strategy is to dene a self-adjoint operator t (0) with the lattice {tn} as its spec-
trum, then to use the data {t
n} to specify a simple symmetric restriction t of t (0),
and nally to construct its u(1)- family of self-adjoint extensions t (). the scalar
product of their eigenvectors yields the desired sampling kernel g(t, tn).
to this end, consider the self-adjoint operator

on its domain dt (0), and its unitary cayley transform

t (0) := xn

tn |tnihtn|

u(0) = xn

tn  i
tn + i |tn ihtn|

(12)

(13)

which is dened on the entire hilbert space h = dt (0). we restrict u(0) to a simple
isometric operator s = u(0)|hc|v+i by taking from its domain one dimension spanned
by a normalized vector |v+i  h. the inverse cayley transform then yields a simple
symmetric operator t on dt

dt = n|i  dt (0) | hv+| ((t (0) + i)|i) = 0o

(14)

i the so-dened dt is dense and contains no eigenvectors. in the {|tni}-basis, the
condition hv+| ((t (0) + i)|i) = 0 reads pnhv+|tni(tn + i)htn|i = 0. thus, for dt
to be dense, |v+i must be chosen such that pn |hv+|tni (tn + i)|2 is divergent, since

5

otherwise all of dt would be orthogonal to a vector in h. the condition that there
are no eigenvectors in dt implies that |v+i must be chosen such that hv+|tni 6= 0 for
all n. the second deciency space is of course spanned by |vi = u(0)|v+i. now
a u(1)-family of self-adjoint extensions t () of t is obtained as the inverse cayley
transforms of the unitary extensions u() of s:

u() = (cid:16)1  |vihv| + ei|vihv|(cid:17) u(0)

(15)

the choice of a spectrum {tn} = {tn(0)} and a deciency vector |v+i thus determines
a family of self-adjoints t () and unitaries u() with their eigenbases {|tn()i} (up to
phases). the tn() are strictly monotonic since each eigenvalue of t  is nondegenerate
and no eigenvector can be in the domain of two self-adjoint extensions.

the aim is to calculate the sampling kernel, i.e. the scalar products of the eigenvec-
tors of the unitary and self-adjoint extensions. to this end, let |tr()i be a normalized
eigenvector of the operators u() and t (). then:

tr()  i
tr() + i htn|tr()i = htn| (u()|tr()i)

= htn|(cid:16)(cid:16)1 + (ei  1)|vihv|(cid:17) u(0)|tr()i(cid:17)
tn  i
tn + i htn|tr()i + (ei  1)htn|vihv+|tr()i

=

htn|tr()i =

fn n(tr())
tr()  tn

(16)

tr() + i

2i

thus,

where we dened

n(tr()) :=

(ei  1) hv+|tr()i
and fn := (tn + i) htn|vi. note that also fn = (tn  i)htn|v+i.
we require the sampling kernel to be real, i.e. ht|tn()i  ir. to this end, we rst use
the freedom of phase of the eigenvectors |ti so that n(t)  ir for all t, which leaves a
residual phase freedom of 1. further, we must also require that all fn  ir, which is
a restriction on the possible choices of deciency vectors |v+i. the remaining freedom
in the phases of the eigenvectors we can use such that all fn  0.
the constraints on the choice of |v+i are therefore in one-to-one correspondence to
the following constraints on the choice of coecients fn: all fn > 0,

(18)

clearly, such fn only exist if |tn|   for n   and/or for n  , reecting
the functional analytical fact that only semibounded or fully unbounded symmetric

operators can have nonzero deciency indices.
we calculate n(tr()):

1 = xn htr()|tni htn|tr()i = xn

thus, for all t in the family {tr()} there holds

conclusions
as a simple illustration, let us see how the shannon sampling formula arises as a
special case. the class of signals with constant bandwidth max is characterized by
the family of lattices {tn()} with tn() =  + n/2max. we choose to sample on the
lattice {tn} = {tn(0)}, whos derivative {t
n = 1. thus, eq.5 yields the sampling
formula:

since this equation must coincide with the shannon formula, eq.1, we can conclude
that

which provides an example of a series expansion deduced with the new method. note

it is clear that the scope for practical applications of the new sampling theorem can
be widened, within the methods described here, to include the insertion of accumu-
lation points and pieces of continuous spectra into sampling lattices.
it remains to
address, however, important issues such as the generalization of convergence improve-
ment through over-sampling.

further, we showed that signals with varying bandwidth are equivalent to elds on
fuzzy-a type spaces with a spatially varying ultraviolet cuto. this implies that the
present results can provide detailed information on certain candidates for the structure
of space-time at the planck scale, see [6]. these include, in particular, the stringy
uncertainty relations which have been widely discussed in the context of string theory
and quantum gravity, see e.g.[7]. a detailed study on this correspondence is in progress.
