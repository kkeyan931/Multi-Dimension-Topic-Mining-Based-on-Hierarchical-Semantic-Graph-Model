abstract

we formulate the soliton equations on the lattice in terms of the reduced
moyal algebra which includes one parameter. the vanishing limit of the
parameter leads to the continuous soliton equations.

it is well-known that the soliton equations are expressed as a zero-curvature
equation emerging as a compatibility condition of the scattering problem
equation and the time evolution equation in the inverse scattering problem.
the potentials are sl(n, c) valued. many of the familiar soliton equations
fall into n = 2 case. in this letter we shall consider a formulation of soliton
equation by using the moyal algebra[1] which is identical to su(n) algebra for
some value of parameter in it[2, 3, 4]. in order to realize this, we replace the
commutation relation in the zero-curvature equation by the moyal algebra,
which introduces two new variables into the equations. we assume that the
potentials are expanded by powers of ep where the variable p is one of the
newly introduced variables. specication of the expansion determines the
type of soliton equation. substituting the potentials into the zero-curvature
equation, we obtain various soliton equations. taking out coecients at each
order of power of ep in the zero-curvature equation, we obtain soliton equa-
tions on the lattice, one of which is the well-known toda lattice equation. in
general, the equations thus obtained include one parameter originating from
the moyal algebra. it is interesting to note that the parameter of the moyal
bracket has a physical meaning in the soliton equation as spacing between
particles on the lattice[5]. we then naturally obtain the continuous corre-
spondence of the discrete soliton equations by taking the vanishing limit of
the parameter.

we rst recapitulate the notations of the moyal algebra following strachan[6].

dene the star product by

f  g = exp"ij 

xi



 xj#f (x)g(x)|x=x,

and the brackets by

{f, g} =

f  g  f



,

(1)

(2)

where x = (x0, x1) and x = (x0, x1). here the  bracket is the moyal
bracket. we also introduce dx operator by

dxf  g =

df
dx

g  f

dg
dx

.

(3)

the dx is the hirota operator. so far we have not yet assumed any x
dependence of the functions in the moyal algebra. here we assume that

2

the functions are the product of a function of x and the power of ep. it is
interesting to note that the star product for those functions are related to
the hirota operator;

[epf (x)]  [ep f (x)] = e2p exp(dx)f  f .

(4)

in more general cases with other ep dependences, we have

[empf (x)]  [enpg(x)]

= exp{(m + n)p}"{exp(n

d
dx

)f (x)}{exp(m

d
dx

)g(x)}#

= exp{(m + n)p}f (x + n)g(x  m),

(5)

where m and n are integers. the brackets are explicitly obtained as

{empf, enpg}
1


exp{(m + n)p}"f (x + n)g(x  m)  g(x + m)f (x  n)#. (6)

=

we can naturally obtain the    limit of the brackets;

lim
0

df
dx

g  m

dg
dx

f ) exp{(m + n)p},

(7)

(8)

{empf, enpg} = 2(n

lim
0

{empf, enpg}+ = 2f g.

we shall next consider the soliton equation. of the various formulations
of soliton theory, we consider the inverse scattering method where the soliton
equation is obtained as a compatibility condition of the scattering problem
equation and time evolution equation. the soliton equation has a geometrical
meaning as the zero-curvature equation:

a
x 

a
x + [a, a] = 0,

(9)

where the potentials a = a(x0, x1)( = 0, 1) are sl(n, c) valued elds
and include a spectral parameter in the soliton theory. the expansion of
potentials in terms of the spectral parameter implies the equations at each
order of the parameter which leads to various soliton equations.

3

we shall discuss the moyal version of the above equation. our discus-
sion is based on the fact that the moyal algebra and the su(n) algebra are
identical by some assumption on the parameter in the moyal algebra[2, 3, 4].
this means that we might replace the commutation relation by the moyal
algebra. the equation reads

a
x 

a
x + {a, a} = 0.

(10)

in general, the replacement of the commutation relation by the moyal bracket
introduces two new variables, say, x and p and so transfers the original equa-
tion to the 2 dimensional higher equation in compensation of the loss of
matrix. here we assume that the functions constituting the above equa-
tion (10) are written as the product of function of induced variable x and a
function of another induced variable p as

a0(x0, x1; x, p) = xk
a1(x0, x1; x, p) = xl

ekpak(x0, x1; x),

elpbl(x0, x1; x).

(11)

(12)

here k and l run over positive and/or non-positive integers of which the
choice determines the soliton equation. the specication of the range of k
and l together with the coecients leads to various soliton equations. the
expansions are to be compared with the inverse scattering method where the
potentials are expanded in terms of spectral parameter. here ep plays the
role of spectral parameter. the zero-curvature equation (10) implies a set of
equations taken out at each order of power of ep. therefore, in the transition
to the moyal version of soliton equation, we do not add two dimensions but
one dimension to the original equation.

in our previous paper[5], we obtained the algebra composed of brackets
between operators which are the exponentiation of the operators satisfying
conformal algebra. the brackets are found to be identical to those derived
from the moyal algebra by the reduction assuming that functions of x and p
are expanded by e0 and ep. the restriction of functions to those ep depen-
dences implies the limitation on the potentials that they should take value
only on the cartan and simple algebra. in the following examples (i) and (ii)
fall into this case. but we can allow for other ep dependences. the example
could be found in (iii).

we shall put an ansatz that a = a(r; x, p) or a = a(t; x, p) where
x0 = 0 and x1 = r just to identify our examples with the well-known equa-
tions. this leads to either

or

da0

= {a0, a1},

= {a1, a0},

respectively. we shall consider several examples below.

(i)toda lattice equation

assume that

a1(t; x, p) = b(t; x) +

a0(t; x, p) =

1
2

the equation (14) implies

1

a(t; x)(ep + ep),

a(t; x)(ep + ep).

b(t; x) =

d
dt
a(t; x)ep = {aep, be0}.

{aep, aep},

d

by using (6), these are

d

b(t; x) =

2"a2(t; x + )  a2(t; x  )#,
"b(t; x + )  b(t; x  )#a(t; x).

a(t; x) =

these equations lead to

d2
dt2

(t; x) =

1

2"e(t;x+2)  2e(t;x) + 2e(t;x2)#,

where

(t; x) = 2 log a(t; x).

when we impose the condition x = n, (n  z) on the above equation, we
nd that the equation is to be regarded as toda lattice equation except at
end points where the equations are dierent from the equation. this shows
an important aspect of the moyal version of soliton equation. the toda
lattice equation can be written in terms of the cartan matrix which reects
the algebra we choose. the toda lattice equation for nite size of particles
corresponds to the choice of nite dimensional algebra an. the present
type of equation is either the toda lattice equation with innite number of
particles or that on the link. mathematically these are derived assuming a
or the kac-moody algebra denoted by an,1, respectively. on the other hand,
it is known that the   0 limit in the moyal algebra leads to the poisson
bracket. in identifying the moyal algebra with su(n) algebra one sets the
relation   1
n , which means that nite  corresponds to nite n i.e.nite
number of particles. this shows that the moyal version of soliton equation
derives the soliton equation with periodic boundary condition of which the
algebraic specication is an,1. we can take   0 limit of eqs.(17) and (18)
by using eq.(7);


t

b(t; x) = 

a(t; x)ep = 2a

(23)

(24)

we thus obtain the continuous counterpart of the toda lattice equation quite
naturally:

2
t2

2

(t; x) = 4

e(t;x).

(25)

(ii)bogomolny equation[7, 8, 9]

we assume that

a0(r; x, p) = e0(r) +

a1(r; x, p) =

1
2

the eq.(13) implies[6]

1
2

(epf (r; x) + epf (r; x)),

(epf (r; x)  epf (r; x)).

(28)

ep df

= {e0, epf },

= {e0, epf }.

equivalently, these are written as

d(r; x)

=

1

2"|f (x + )|2  |f (x  )|2#,
"(r; x + )  (r; x  )#,
"(r; x + )  (r; x  )#.

these lead to
d2
dr2

where

(r; x) = 

1
2 [e(r;x+2)  2e(r;x) + 2e(r;x2)],

(r; x) =  log |f (r; x)|2.

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

by taking   0 limit in the moyal brackets, we can rewrite the eqs.(28)-
(30) by using the derivative operators instead of the dierences. we thus
obtain the continuous limit of the bogomolny equation[5, 10, 11] as

2
r2

(r; x) = 4

2
x2

e(r;x),

(36)

which can be interpreted as su() bogomolny equation.

(iii)km equation

this example is the case where the expansion of potentials include e2p terms
besides ep terms, which means that these expansion does not have an algebra
counterpart taking value only on the cartan sub algebra and simple roots in
contrast with the previous examples. assuming that

a1(t; x) = a(t; x)(ep + ep),

(37)

a0(t; x) = "  {a(t; x)ep, a(t; x)ep}+ + {a(t; x)ep, a(t; x)ep}+#,(38)

7

we obtain from (14)

d
dt

a(t; x)ep = {aep, {aep, aep}+},

or

d
dt

a(t; x) = 

2

"a2(t; x + 2)  a2(t; x  2)#a(t; x).

this can be written as

d
dt

u(t; x) =

4

"eu(t;x+2)  eu(t;x2)#,

where

u(t; x) = 2 log a(t; x).

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

this is the equation discussed by kac and van maerbeke(km)[12]. we can
also obtain the continuous limit;


t

u(t; x) = 16


x

eu(t;x).

(43)

in this letter we showed the formulation of soliton equations in terms of
the moyal algebra and exemplied it by well-known equations. the speci-
cation how the potentials are expanded in terms of ep leads to the various
soliton equations on one-dimensional link lattice of which the algebraic speci-
cation is an,1. we found that, in the present formulation the role of ep is the
spectral parameter in the soliton equation in the inverse scattering method,
and the parameter  in the moyal algebra has a physical meaning of spacing
on the lattice. in km equation we have an anti-commutation bracket expres-
sion for one of the potentials, which might be related to the super-symmetric
formulation of the moyal version of zero-curvature equation. we shall leave
this for the following work.

the author would like to express his gratitude to prof.s.saito for discussion.
