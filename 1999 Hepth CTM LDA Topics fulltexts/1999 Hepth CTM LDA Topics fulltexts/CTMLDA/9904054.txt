however, seven special lines radiating p1 also pass second blown-up point. (to dp8 manifold, eight blow-up points must general position, three ever line.) shown figure 3. let us consider one seven lines, say one passes p2. transform line dp8 splits two curves c = c1 + c2 (5.4) rst component c1 projects back line p2. second component corresponds curve wrapping blown p1 p2 analog p2. specically, classes two curves  = l e1 e2,  = e2 using results appendix {$9901009$}, see   =   = 1 (5.5) (5.6) follows curves exceptional classes dp8 cannot deformed within base. hence, new moduli moving base appear curve splits. form (5.5), see that, curve splits, c1 remains line p2 topologically still sphere, c2 wraps blown p1 and, so, also topologically sphere. furthermore, intersection number   = 1 19 (5.7) figure 4: splitting single sphere pair spheres implies two spheres intersect one point. happened single sphere c pinched pair spheres shown figure 4. summary, moduli space curves c base, homology class = l e1, have,  l e1 genus moduli space p1 7 pts. 0 (l e1 ei) + (ei) 0 + 0 single pt. (5.8) second line = 2, . . . , 8. next step nd, given curve c, many curves w full calabi yau space project onto c. furthermore, w must homology class l e1. let us start curve c generic point moduli

2. denition, surface elliptic bration c which, means bration p1. general, surface number singular bers. equal intersection number discriminant curve , gives position singular bers b, base curve c. recall  = 12kb. using results summarized appendix {$9901009$}, since base dp8 surface intersection numbers depend homology classes,   = 12 (3l e1 e8) (l e1) = 24 (5.10) thus see that, generically, sc elliptic bration p1 24 singular bers. implies {$9603142$} sc k3 surface (5.11) curve c zero section bration. further, projection gives us map actual curve w image c base. projection wraps c once, so, since c 20 singular, map invertible w must also section sc. question simplies asking: moduli space sections sc class l e1? answer question, start identifying algebraic classes sc. know least two classes inherited calabiyau threefold: class zero section c, write dc, class elliptic ber, fc . specically, inclusion map dc fc map corresponding classes x ic : sc x ic dc =  = l e1 ic fc = f ic map classes ic : h2(sc, z) h2(x, z) (5.12) (5.13) (5.14) relevant generic classes x. however, may additional classes sc map class x map ic kernel. say, two curves homologous x may homologous sc. however, note generic k3 surface would algebraic classes since h2,0 6= 0 (see discussion section 3.2). given case elliptically bered k3 section least two algebraic classes, choice complex structure sc cannot completely general. however, generically, reason believe algebraic classes. particular choices complex structure additional classes may appear but, since considering generic properties moduli space, ignore possibility. now, require w , like c, also class l e1 full calabiyau space. immediately implies, given map (5.13), w also class dc zero section c sc. furthermore, calculate self-intersection number class within sc. done follows. recall riemannhurwitz formula {$9603142$} applied curve c states 2g 2 = deg kc (5.15) g genus kc cohomology class canonical bundle c. adjunction formula {$9603142$} gives deg kc = (ksc + dc ) dc (5.16) ksc canonical class k3 surface sc. using fact canonical class k3 surface zero, ksc = 0, c sphere g = 0, follows (5.15) (5.16) dc dc = 2 21 (5.17) implies section cannot deformed within surface sc. conclusion, see is, generically, moduli space curves w project onto c. rather, curve sc class l e1 section c itself. see that, generically, curve w move base x cannot deformed ber direction. recall vebrane wrapped w also modulus describing position s1/z2, well axionic modulus. together, discussed previous section, form p1 moduli space. thus, conclude moduli space associated generic curve (5.8) locally simply mgeneric = (cid:0)p1 7 pts.(cid:1) p1 (5.18) discussed above, since axion twisted, globally, extends p1 bundle p1. physically, single vebrane wrapping irreducible curve calabiyau threefold, lies entirely within base b. curve deformed base, gives rst factor moduli space, cannot deformed ber direction. also move orbifold interval dierent values axionic modulus, gives second factor (5.18). since curve genus zero, vector elds low-energy theory. thus far discussed generic part moduli space. full moduli space form m(l e1) = (cid:0)p1 7 pts.(cid:1) p1 mnon-generic (5.19) additional piece mnon-generic describes moduli space special 7 points curve c splits two components. analyze part moduli space, must consider component separately, use procedure used above. fact image c splits, means original curve w must also split x w = w1 + w2 (5.20) c1 projection onto base w1 c2 projection w2. let us consider case line p2 also intersects p2. homology classes w1 w2 must split  = l e1 e2  = e2 (5.21) note one might imagine adding nf  nf , still leaving total  unchanged correct projection onto base. however, (3.6), see one class would eective so, since w1 w2 must correspond physical vebrane, splitting allowed. start w1, nd curves x project onto c1 homology class l e1 e2, begin, above, surface sc1 = 1(c1) c1. calculating 22 number singular bers, nd  = 12 (3l e1 e8) (l e1 e2) = 12 (5.22) since c1 sphere, elliptic bration p1 12 singular bers, implies {$9603142$} sc1 dp9 surface (5.23) similarly, consider  = e2,  = 12 (3l e1 e8) e2 = 12 (5.24) since curve c2 also sphere, follows elliptic bration p1 12 singular bers, hence also sc2 dp9 surface (5.25) thus, considering degeneration k3 surface sc, 24 singular bers, pair dp9 surfaces sc1 sc2, 12 singular bers. given dp9 surface, say sc1, guaranteed, k3 surface, least two algebraic classes, section class dc1 ber class fc1. however, dp9 case interesting case k3 surface since always additional algebraic classes. dp9 surface, h2,0 = 0. consequently, discussed section 3.2, whatever complex structure one chooses, classes h2(dp9, z) algebraic. thus, one nds algebraic classes dp9 form 10-dimensional lattice. since two distinguished classes calabiyau threefold (namely l e1 ber class f ), implies distinct classes sc1 must map class x. say, curves homologous sc1 homologous one considers full threefold x. full analysis extra classes sc1 considered section 6.3. particular case, turn that, w1 class c1 full calabiyau threefold, must also class within sc1. thus, interested moduli space section class dc1 sc1. now, recall (see, instance, appendix {$9901009$}) = fd. analogous calculation (5.17), using canonical class dp9 simply ksc1 fact dc1 fd = 1 since c1 section, dc1 dc1 = 1 (5.26) means curve c1 cannot deformed within sc1. thus, k3 case, possible w1 section c1 itself. 23 identical calculation goes component w2. furthermore, analysis six exceptional points moduli space. given curve split two components points, two separate moduli describing position component s1/z2 well two moduli describing axionic degree freedom component. follows 7(p1 p1) = p1 p1 p1 p1. nd, then, full moduli space mnon-generic = 7(cid:0)p1 p1 a(cid:1) (5.27) branched structure, m(l e1) = (cid:0)p1 7 pts.(cid:1) p1 7(cid:0)p1 p1 a(cid:1) (5.28) where, globally,

generically, expect additional multiplets low-energy theory points. might expect also component moduli space curve w split all, is, single vebrane class l e1 + f . analyze second possibility simply follow analysis given above, rst consider moduli space image c w base nd moduli space curves project given curve c. since projection f onto base zero, image  base = l e1, above. thus many results previous discussion carry situation. moduli space c given (5.8). generic point moduli space sc = 1(c) k3 surface, seven special points c splits, surface two components c dp9 surface. consider rst generic point moduli space, w section k3 surface, must class l e1 + f . many sections there? turns generic k3 none. see follows. adjunction, since genus c zero, showed equation (5.17) class sc satises dc dc = 2. identical calculation applies section, since sections genus zero. thus, particular, c c = 2 (5.33) c, mean class w sc. however, map classes (5.13), clear c = dc + fc . since dc class zero

discussed above, space component dp9 surface and, unlike k3 case, many algebraic classes dp9 zero section ber. specically, suppose separate pure ber component w consider point c splits c1 + c2  = l e1

furthermore, one show none sections intersect base calabiyau manifold. thus, since, case considering, w2 lies solely base, nd w1 w2 never overlap. relative positions within calabiyau threefold shown

giving moduli space p1 p1 (5.36) furthermore, since sections dp9 topologically spheres, vector multiplets part moduli space. noted above, vebranes cannot overlap. hence, possibility additional
