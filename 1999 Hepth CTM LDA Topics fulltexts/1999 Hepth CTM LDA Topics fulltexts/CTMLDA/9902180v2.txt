abstract

we discuss the sigma model on the p sl(n|n) supergroup manifold. we demonstrate
that this theory is exactly conformal. the chiral algebra of this model is given by some

extension of the virasoro algebra, similar to the w algebra of zamolodchikov. we also

show that all group invariant correlation functions are coupling constant independent and

can be computed in the free theory. the non invariant correlation functions are highly

nontrivial and coupling dependent. at the end we compare two and three-point correlation
functions of the p sl(1, 1|2) sigma model with the correlation functions in the boundary
theory of ads3  s3 and nd a qualitative agreement.

1. introduction

in this paper we discuss two-dimensional nonlinear sigma models on the supergroup
manifolds p sl(n|n). the interest in these models is motivated by the recent discoveries in
the string theory. it was long suspected by polyakov and others (see, for example [1] and

references therein) that gauge theory can be described by some version of string theory.

the rst concrete example of this was recently suggested in [2]. the strings propagate in
the ads-type supergravity background. the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory lives
on the boundary of the ads space and provides boundary conditions for the bulk gravity

theory. the supergravity describes the large coupling limit of the gauge theory (literally
speaking g2n =  limit). the 1/n corrections can be identied with string loops. the
string theory appears to be critical with constant dilaton which implies that the boundary

theory is conformal.

the immediate problem is to understand string theory in the ads-type backgrounds.

unfortunately, the nsr formalism does not seem to be suitable for the description of rr

backgrounds. the appearance of the rr vertex operators introduces an arbitrary number

of cuts ruining the nsr worldsheet. one can dene/compute the scattering amplitudes of

several rr vertex operators but it is unclear how to describe a condensate or a background

of rr elds. the gs formalism seems to be more appropriate for that. this reminds us of

the sigma model with the target space being the supermanifold. therefore, one can suggest
that the p su (1, 1|2), or more generally the p sl(n|n) = sl(n|n)/u (1) sigma models
indeed, the appearance of the worldsheet
would naturally appear in this description.

scalars/target space fermions is the genuine feature of the gs-type actions. on the other

hand the second order fermionic kinetic term indicates the possible relation to rr ux. in
fact, there are suggestions for a gs formulation of string theory based on the p sl(n|n)
cosets [411]. unfortunately, it is unclear how to quantize this string theory. the above

provides more than enough motivation to study these sigma models.

to be a bit more precise, one can say that p su (1, 1|2) sigma model is related to
string theory propagating in ads3  s3  m 4 background. the nsr formulation of string
theory propagating on this background was given in [3]. the classical formulation of gs
superstring was discussed in [46]. the p su (1, 1|2) sigma model is not a string theory
yet but it is going to be an important ingredient in the construction. such string theory

was recently proposed in [12].

similarly, the sigma model on a p su (2, 2|4) is related to the string theory on the
ads5  s5 background. the latter can be regarded as the bosonic part (body) of a
quotient superspace of a supergroup by the subgroup

t =

p su (2, 2|4)

so(4, 1)  so(5)

(1.1)

the so(4, 1)  so(5) action is an isometry without xed points. notice, that there is
no gko construction and therefore it is not obvious that the quotient (1.1) leads to the
conformal theory. however the subgroup so(4, 1)  so(5) turns out to be very special
and one can show that the sigma model on a quotient space is one loop nite. moreover,

we expect that sigma model on the quotient space is exactly conformal in all oders in

perturbation theory. the classical formulation of gs string theory based on this quotient
was discussed in [7], [811]. we believe that understanding the p su (2, 2|4) sigma model
may shed some light on how the string theory on ads5  s5 background can be quantized.
it is clear, even without making any calculations, that the p sl(n|n) sigma models are
quite remarkable. the dual coxeter number cv vanishes for these groups and therefore

the one loop beta function, which is proportional to cv , is also zero. hence, one may
suspect that these theories are exactly conformal. moreover, the supermanifold p sl(n|n)
is in a sense a calabi-yau supermanifold (see [13]). namely, the ricci tensor is identically
equal to zero rij  cv gij. the ricci atness implies that the theory is one loop nite.
in [13] the niteness of the theory was ensured by n = 2 supersymmetry, in our case
the theory is conformal without worldsheet supersymmetry. the idea of thinking about
p sl(n|n) as a calabi-yau manifold could be very fruitful for possible future applications.
for example, one may try to construct new examples of supermanifolds that lead to exactly
conformal eld theories by tensoring several p sl(n|n) models and then taking a quotient
by certain subgroups. very little is known about sigma models on supermanifolds and

potential applications are enormous.

in this paper we study the sigma model on a supergroup p sl(n|n) in perturbation
theory (large volume expansion). clearly, there is no choice of real structure on the group

for which the metric is positive denite. nevertheless, we assume that the theory can

be well dened. for most part of the text our discussion is going to be purely algebraic

such that it does not require a choice of the real structure on the group. we specify
the signature at the very end when we discuss the relation to ads3  s3. we prove
that the theory is exactly conformal to all orders in perturbation theory for any values of

2

the coupling constant. we also prove that the correlation functions of the group invariant

combinations of operators are given by the gaussian integration and the interaction vertices

do not contribute to these calculations. this observation does not make the theory trivial.

there are plenty of correlation functions that have a non-trivial dependence on the sigma

model coupling. these are the correlation functions that are not invariant under the group

action. the spectrum of conformal primary elds is classied by the representations of the
left/right multiplication symmetry group  v(l,r). we will describe a certain class of
operators (analogous to vertex operators of string theory) corresponding to representations
(l, r) such that all casimir operators c(n) have the same eigenvalues for both of them
(c(n)
). we conjecture that conformal dimensions of these operators are equal to
l
 =  = 2c(2)/2, where  is the sigma model coupling constant and c(2) is the eigenvalue
of quadratic casimir. these operators are very similar to the momentum modes of c = 1
system on a circle. we also nd that p sl(n|n) sigma model has a chiral algebra which
is an extension of the virasoro algebra (similar to w-algebras of zamolodchikov). very

little is known about such w-algebras and it could be a very promising direction for future

studies.

in section 3 we study our sigma model in perturbation

properties of p sl(n|n) group.
theory and show that it is exactly conformal using the background method. then we
analyze the possible quantum corrections to the equation tzz = 0 and show that they
vanish. we also present some examples of correlation functions involving currents.
in

section 4 we present some non-perturbative arguments based on localization. in section 5
we describe the chiral algebra of the p sl(n|n) sigma model. we believe that the presence
of this algebra should be important for solving the theory. finally, in the last section we
discuss physical operators and try to make contact with the string theory on ads3  s3.
while this paper was in a nal stage of preparation we received a paper [12], that

partially overlaps ours.

2. principal chiral field

the p sl(n|n) principal chiral eld is a two-dimensional non-linear sigma model with
the elds g(x) taking values in a supergroup p sl(n|n). the action for the principal chiral
model is

s[g] =

(2.1)

1

42 z str(cid:0)|g1dg|2(cid:1)d2x .

3

it is invariant with respect to both left and right multiplications g(x)  ulg(x)u 1
corresponding conserved currents are

r , the

jr = g1dg , jl = dgg1 .

(2.2)

in its turn, the left current is invariant under the right multiplication symmetry, while the

right current is invariant under the left multiplication. under the left (right) multiplication
the left (right) current transforms by conjugation jl,r  ul(r)jl(r)u 1
l(r). the presence
of this symmetry (especially its fermionic part) makes it dicult to dene a theory.

let us remind the reader what happens in the case of conventional bosonic sigma

models. as usual, correlation functions are normalized by the partition function

hyi

oii = r [dg]qoies
r [dg]es

.

(2.3)

the integral runs over the space of maps from our worldsheet (say, the sphere) into the

group manifold. the symmetry groups gl/gr act on this space by left/right multiplica-

tions. therefore one can try to factorize the path integral into the integral over the space

of orbits and a nite dimensional integration along the orbit. in the case of correlation

functions invariant under either gl or gr action, integration along the corresponding

orbit introduces a multiplicative factor (the volume of the group), which cancels in the

numerator and denominator. for non-invariant quantities the group integration projects

on the invariant subspace.

one way to compute correlation functions is to use perturbation theory. to build a

perturbation theory one is forced to x the false vacuum to expand around. for example,

one can impose the condition that at innity the eld g(x) approaches some xed element

g0. this choice clearly breaks the left/right multiplication symmetry. again, in the case

of correlation functions invariant under either gl or gr action, the remaining integral

over g0 can be thought of as an integral along the orbit of a symmetry action and hence

gives the same volume factor which cancels. the quantum eld around g0 is a goldstone

boson of this broken symmetry and therefore massless. consequently, we run into infrared

problems. to cure those one can add a small mass term, or the potential around g0, or

work in the nite volume. however, the above correlation functions are perturbatively well

dened, i.e., ir nite [14] [15] and therefore one may trust the perturbative calculations.

still, one has to be careful making conclusions based on them. the perturbation theory

4

does not feel the global properties of the group as it is built as an expansion around a

particular point.

it is instructive to consider a simple example of a free scalar eld theory. the theory
is invariant with respect to a constant shift x  x + c (zero mode). the correlation
function of the vertex operators requires an ir cuto m

heikx(z1)...eikx(zn)i = m(p ki)2/2y|zi  zj|kikj .

(2.4)

this correlation function is invariant under the symmetry x  x + c only if p ki = 0

(otherwise it gets multiplied by a phase). invariant correlation functions are independent

on the ir cuto, while non-invariant correlation functions vanish.

trying to repeat the above steps in the case of a supergroup we nd that the naive

integration along the orbit produces zero  the volume of the supergroup. however we

still want to dene correlation functions by normalizing them by the partition function

as in (2.3). formally, the numerator and denominator vanish as the consequence of the

zero group volume, but we can take a sensible limit to dene the ratio. first we need to

break the left/right multiplication symmetry, say by the same condition that at innity

the group element g(x) approaches some xed element g0. the uctuations around the

false vacuum g0 are massless bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. the latter

give zero (due to fermionic zero modes) while the massless bosons give rise to the infrared

problems. again, adding a small mass term or the potential around g0 xes both problems

and allows one to dene the correlation function as the limit of the ratio when the mass/ir

cut-o is sent to zero. in fact this is exactly what is computed in perturbation theory for

the conventional principal chiral model.

the gl or gr invariant correlation functions are again ir nite and therefore this

procedure provides a consistent way of making sense out of (2.3). the situation with

non-invariant quantities is far from being well understood. in the bosonic case the group

integration eectively projects on the group invariant subsector. in the case of a super-

group, there is no well dened projection operator and one has to be very careful (some

examples of these computations will be discussed later).

2.1. introduction to gl(n|n), sl(n|n) and p sl(n|n) groups.

the groups gl(n|n), sl(n|n) and p sl(n|n) are closely related to each other. the
supergroup gl(n|n) consists of real (n|n) supermatrices with non-zero superdeterminant.
sl(n|n) is a subgroup of gl(n|n)  simply matrices with superdeterminant equal to
1.
it has a normal u (1) subgroup  matrices, that are multiples of the identity. the
p sl(n|n) is a factor of sl(n|n) by that subgroup. unfortunately, p sl(n|n) does not
have a representation in m at(n|n). this u (1)  sl(n|n) that one has to factor out to get
the p sl(n|n) group appears as an additional gauge symmetry in the sl(n|n) principal
chiral eld. this suggests a way to think about p sl(n|n) principal chiral eld as a gauge
invariant subsector of the sl(n|n) sigma model.

we start with properties of the above groups or, rather, their lie superalgebras. the
superalgebra gl(n|n) has a non-degenerate metric given by gij = str(titj ), where ti are
the generators of gl(n|n) in the fundamental representation. we choose the generators of
gl(n|n) as follows: rst (2n)22 generators span a subspace of supertraceless and traceless
2n  2n matrices and we denote them as ta. the remaining generators are the identity
matrix i, and matrix j, j = diag(1, . . . , 1, 1, . . . ,1). also note, that tas together with
the identity generate sl(n|n), i.e. their commutators close without j.

generators ta get projected on generators of psl(n|n) algebra and we keep the same
notations for them. the tas do not generate psl(n|n), as an identity appears among
commutators of ta. however, if we ignore the identity part of the commutators

[ta, tb] = f c

ab tc + dabi

(2.5)

we would obtain the structure constants of psl(n|n), and the jacobi identity is satised as
one can easily check. ignoring means subtracting identity to make the result traceless.

note that the trace and supertrace operations are related to each other str(x) = t r(xj).

in our basis the gl(n|n) metric looks like:

gab

0




0

0

2n

2n

0


 .

the metric gab is an invariant metric on psl(n|n).

6

2.2. comments on gl(n|n) principal chiral model

the group gl(n|n) is not semi-simple and it has a family of invariant metrics g()

ij =
str(titj) + str(ti)str(tj). this metric is non-degenerate for any value of . a simple
calculation shows that at one loop a new term is generated

s =

1

()2 z str(cid:0)|g1dg|2(cid:1) + ()z |str(g1dg)|2 ,

(2.6)

which eectively introduces the cut-o dependence of the metrics g()
ab .

to get the sl(n|n) principal chiral model one just needs to restrict g to lie in sl(n|n)
subgroup. there are two related issues (i) the sl(n|n) invariant metric is degenerate and
(ii) the sl(n|n) principal chiral action has u (1) gauge symmetry. the appearance of this
gauge invariance is quite remarkable and happens only for sl(n|n). it acts as g  eg.
under this symmetry the current gets shifted j  j + d, but the action is still invariant
because e is proportional to the identity matrix. restricting oneself to a gauge invariant
sector is the equivalent of making a quotient p sl(n|n) = sl(n|n)/u (1). at the same time
the problem (i) also disappears, the p sl(n|n) has an invariant non-degenerate metric.

the gl(n|n) lie algebra has a decomposition gl(n|n) = f  b0  f+, where f are
the subspaces of the lower and upper triangular odd matrices and b0 = gl(n)  gl(n),
the even part of the gl(n|n). every element qij  f is nilpotent and [f, f+]  b0.
the gl(n|n) contains many operators that may play a role of the brst operator. as we
already explained, the left/right multiplication symmetry is broken by the choice of the
vacuum (for simplicity we choose g0 = i). still our model is invariant with respect to
conjugations. as we will see, the gl(n|n) is essentially a topological sigma model. for
example, consider operator[16]

q =

i=n

xi=1

qn+i j .

the action of this operator corresponds to conjugation by the matrix

0

(cid:18) 1
1 1(cid:19)

(2.7)

(2.8)

this operator is clearly nilpotent, but what is more important, the gl(n|n) sigma model
action is q-exact! indeed, if we represent the current j as 2  2 block matrix 1

j = (cid:18) a 
 b(cid:19)

1 it does not matter whether we choose the left or the right current. their transformation

properties dier by sign.

7

then the transformation properties are

a =  ,

b = 
 = (a  b) .

 = 0 ,

(2.9)

now it is easy to see that the action (2.1) is q-exact

t r(aa)  t r(bb) + 2t r() = [q, t r((a + b)]

(2.10)

similarly, the induced term in (2.6) is also q-exact. as the result, the computations of

group invariant correlation functions reduces to a classical problem.

the brst operator introduced in (2.7) turns out to be very useful. for example,

using the q-cohomology technique one can prove the following theorem:

if any casimir

operator has a non-zero eigenvalue on an irreducible representation , then the super

dimension of this representation is zero.

the proof goes as follows: consider the universal enveloping algebra u(g) (we would
be interested in the case when g = gl(n|n), sl(n|n) or psl(n|n)). the action of q on g
can be lifted to an action on u(g). now, using the poincare-birkhof-witt theorem one
identies u(g) with s(g) = i=
i=0 si(g), where si(g) are symmetric powers of g. this
identication is (i) an isomorphism of g-modules and (ii) the space of invariants of s(g)
is mapped on the center in u(g) (casimirs). now consider the action of q on s(g). it is
clear that q : si(g)  si(g) and one can dene cohomology h (q, si(g). now, it can be
shown that

for sl(n|n) the cohomology is non-zero only in degrees n = 0, 1 and is spanned by constants
and q. for psl(n|n) the cohomology is non-zero in degrees n = 0, 1, 2 and the quadratic
casimir spans the cohomology in degree n = 2.

as a result all casimir operators are q-commutators c(n) = [q, x (n)] for n > 2.

the super dimension of any irreducible representation can be written as

sdim() = str(i) =

1
c(n) str([q, x (n)]) = 0 ,

(2.12)

where c(n) in the eigenvalue of the n th casimir. now, for psl(n|n) the quadratic casimir
is not q-exact, but its square is! therefore, we can slightly modify our arguments in (2.12)
by replacing c(2) by its square.

this brst-like symmetry can be used to compute some correlation functions for
p sl(n|n) models using the localization technique. we will discuss this issue in one of the
next sections.

3. principal chiral eld as a conformal theory

3.1. background eld method and conformal invariance.

the simple way to show conformal invariance of the p sl(n|n) principal chiral model
is based on the background eld method [17]. in this method the symmetries of the theory

impose strong constraints on the form of the renormalized action, which is very useful. we

nd that our theory is conformal to all orders in perturbation theory.

first of all, the renormalization of the general non-linear sigma model was studied

extensively and the renormalization group ow for it was interpreted as the ow in the

space of metrics on the target manifold. in other words the shape and size of the manifold

changes with the ow [18]. the same topic was also studied using the background eld

method [19] [20]. the main technical diculty for the general case is the necessity to

expand the action in terms of linear elds, e.g. the riemann normal coordinates. in

the case of the group manifold as a target space the expansion simplies dramatically and

terms of any order can be written explicitly. this will allow us to analyze all orders in

perturbation theory.

in the background eld method we parameterize the quantum eld g(x) as g(x)g0(x)
where g0(x) is the classical background and the eld g(x) describes quantum uctuations.
the linear eld for the quantum uctuation is dened by g(x) = ea(x) where  is

inserted just to have a convenient normalization later. a(x) is an element of the lie

algebra and transforms as a tangent vector at the point g0(x). in terms of these elds the
(right) current of the model becomes

  g1g = g1
j g

0 g0 + g1

0 ja

 g0 = j 0

 + g1

0 ja

 g0 ,

(3.1)

where we denoted the background current by j 0 and the current corresponding to quantum
uctuations as ja

 = eaea. the action is then

s[g] = s[ea] + s[g0] +

1

22 z str(cid:0)ja

 (g0)g1
0 (cid:1)

the current ja written in terms of a has the following expansion:

  eaea =
ja



xn=1

n
n!

[..[[a, a], a] . . . a] =

= a +

2
2

[a, a] +

3
3!

[[a, a], a] + . . .

9

(3.2)

(3.3)

we will need the polynomial expansion of (3.2) in terms of a:

l(ea) =

1
2



xn=1

(2n2)
(2n)!

str(cid:0)[..[[a, a], a] . . . a]a(cid:1) =

=

1

4(cid:0)str(aa) +

2
12

str([[a, a], a]a) + . . .(cid:1)

(3.4)

putting it all together we nd that our lagrangian for the quantum eld a(x) in

the background g0(x) contains the following terms: an a-independent part which is the
lagrangian for the background eld itself, free-eld kinetic energy str(aa) and the
interaction terms of two kinds. first, the interaction terms which involve the background

current and single derivative of a and second, the terms that appear in the expansion (3.4),

which contain two derivatives of a. an important point to notice is that all interaction
vertices are built from structure constants of psl(n|n). schematically, each interaction
vertex can be represented as a tree diagram, shown in fig. 1. these diagrams describe the

color structure of the interaction vertices. each three-vertex in the picture represents
a psl(n|n) structure constant fabc and the dashed lines correspond to the contraction of
indices with the psl(n|n) invariant metric gab but no propagator insertion.

fig.1 typical interaction vertices

to compute eective action for the background eld g0(x), one has to evaluate all 1pi

diagrams with external background lines only. the typical diagram is represented in fig.

2. to nd the beta function we have to renormalize uv divergent diagrams. there are of

course ir divergent diagrams, but we assume that they have been regularized as discussed

before, say, by including a small mass term. notice that the structure of interaction

vertices is such that the background current appears in vertices with a single derivative of a.

therefore, by power counting, all primitively divergent diagrams contain no more than two

external lines of the background eld. those diagrams with no background external lines

at all will lead to renormalization of the action for the quantum eld a. the resulting wave

function/vertex renormalization for it would not aect our conclusions because there are

no external a-lines. by choosing the renormalization scheme that preserves the symmetry

10

of the problem, one also ensures that the group structure of renormalized vertices does not

change.

fig.2: example of a diagram with two external background lines

now we will demonstrate that the diagrams with one or two background external lines

are identically equal to zero, even before one computes the momentum integral. all these

diagrams vanish because of the group factors. consider rst the diagrams with a single

external background line. as we mentioned, we represented the interaction vertices as tree

diagrams constructed from three-vertices (structure constants). let us take the 3-vertex

where the external line enters and pull it out of the diagram (see fig. 3a). the rest of

the diagram can be represented as a blob with two external lines. its group structure is

given by a second rank invariant tensor. there is only one such tensor  the metric and

its contraction with the structure constants vanishes.

next let us consider the diagrams with two external background lines and do the

same trick. let us pull out the 3-vertex where the external line enters. the rest of the

diagram is now a blob with three external lines, one of them is the background eld line

and the other two are contracted with the structure constants (see fig. 3b). this blob
is also an invariant tensor. luckily enough, psl(n|n) has only one invariant rank 3 tensor
 structure constants. this can be proved as follows: all rank 3 invariant tensors come
from the gl(n|n). for gl(n|n) there are 6 invariant rank 3 tensors but only one survives
the reduction to psl(n|n). as a result, the whole contraction is proportional to the metric
bc = cv gad. however, that number vanishes for the
times the dual coxeter number fabcfd
psl(n|n) groups 2!

2 there is another group for which dual coxeter number vanishes  osp(2n + 2|2n).

it is

possible that the osp(2n + 2|2) sigma model is also conformal

11

what we just showed is that there are no divergent diagrams for the eective action

and therefore the coupling  is not renormalized to all orders in perturbation theory. hence
the psl(n|n) principal chiral model is perturbatively conformal.

3.2. perturbation theory.

in this section we present an analysis of the perturbation theory for the p sl(n|n)
principal chiral model. we nd that some correlation functions can be computed exactly

to all orders in perturbation theory, in an analogy to the calculations in the background

eld method. we will also prove conformal invariance in a dierent way.

the very denition of the model requires breaking of the gl  gr invariance in order
to get rid of the fermionic zero modes. we choose a false vacuum g(x) = g0 and,
if working in an innite volume, add a small potential term making g0 a true ground
state. this is exactly what is necessary to build a perturbation theory. the action in the

background of the g0 vacuum is given by (3.2) plus the potential term that we choose
as m2str(a2)

spert[a; g0] = s[ea] 

1

4 z d2 m2str(a2) =

=

1

4 z d2 str(aa  m2a2) + sint

(3.5)

although this action explicitly breaks glgr symmetry it is still invariant under the sub-
group which leaves g0 invariant. this remaining symmetry acts on a simply by conjuga-
tion a  h1ah and on g(x) by g(x)  hg(x)g1
0 h1g0. we will explore consequences
of this symmetry later on.

once again, the most important thing to notice about (3.5) is that all the interaction
vertices in sint are built from the structure constants of psl(n|n) in exactly the same
fashion as we found in the background eld method (see fig. 1). in particular, all vertices

have the group structure of tensors invariant under the remaining symmetry, i.e., tensors
invariant under the conjugation by the elements of the lie algebra of psl(n|n).

now suppose we want to compute a correlation function which is manifestly invariant
under the left and right multiplication symmetry gl  gr. as explained, we expect to
trust the answer computed in the broken symmetry phase and we also know that in per-
turbation theory the result is ir-nite. invariance under gl  gr symmetry implies that
the correlation functions are invariant under the symmetry remaining in the perturbation

theory  the conjugation of a. it means that in every order in a the expression inside the

12

correlation function can be written as a product of as and their derivatives with all their

group indices contracted with an invariant tensor:

h()aa1(x1)()aa2(x2) . . . ()aan(xn) da1a2...ani

here da1a2...an is an invariant n-tensor. then the group structure of any feynman diagram
contributing to such a correlation function, even before the momentum integration, can be
represented as follows. it is a collection of invariant tensors of psl(n|n), one coming from
the above expression and others from sint, and all their indices are contracted with the
help of the inverse metric on psl(n|n). most importantly, any subdiagram is then also an
invariant tensor. the rank of this tensor is given by the number of legs connecting it to

the rest of the diagram.

this allows us to do the same trick as before. consider any interaction vertex inside

a given feynman graph. take any three-vertex in it and pull it out. (see fig. 4) the rest

of the diagram is an invariant tensor with three indices. there is only one such tensor for
psl(n|n) - structure constants. the pairwise contraction of all indices of two three-tensors
is proportional to the dual coxeter number f abcfabc = cv a
a = 0. thus all the diagrams
without external lines and with at least one interaction vertex vanish. the remaining

diagrams represent the calculation made in the free theory, sint = 0. moreover, the as

are eectively commuting variables in such calculations since commutators introduce more

of the structure constants in the graph and their contributions vanish.

fig. 4

it may also happen that the invariant tensor da1a2...an entering the correlation function

would itself contain fabc. such correlation functions all vanish, by the same reasoning.

let us illustrate the preceding discussion with some examples. consider gl and
gr invariant bilinears built from the (right) currents: str(jzjz) and str(jzjz). we
can compute expectation values of strings of such operators. the currents themselves

are complicated expressions in terms of a, given in (3.3). fortunately, all the terms but

one contain commutators. therefore the invariant tensors appearing in the correlation

functions with those terms all contain structure constants. thus the only contributing

13

terms are coming from a and a. the calculation reduces to computing expectation
values of strings of str(aa) and str(a a) in the free theory with commuting as.
for example:

hstr(jz(z, z) jz(z, z)) str(jz(0, 0) jz(0, 0))i = 

analogously we nd

44
z4

(3.6)

hstr(jz(z, z) jz(z, z)) str(jz(0, 0) jz(0, 0))i = 0
24
|z|4

hstr(jz(z, z) jz(z, z)) str(jz(0, 0) jz(0, 0))i = 

given these correlation functions we can present another proof that our theory is
conformal at the quantum level. the classical theory is conformal and therefore the z  z
component of the stress-energy tensor is equal to zero. quantum mechanically, there could

an anomaly. however the symmetries of the problem restrict its possible form [21]. it can

only be that tz z = str(jzjz), where  is a constant, possibly dependent on the scale.
now we want to show that  = 0. following zamolodchikov [22] we introduce functions

g(zz) and h(zz) (see also [23])

g(zz) = 4z3 zhtzz(z, z)tz z(0)i
h(zz) = 16z2 z2htz z(z, z)tz z(0)i

(3.7)

the conservation of stress-energy tensor and rotational invariance imply that

4 g  4g + h  2h = 0 ,

where dot denotes the derivative with respect to r2 = zz. now, taking into account that
22 str(jzjz) we conclude that h  2h = 3224 = 0. this means that tz z
tzz =  1
is actually zero quantum mechanically in perturbation theory. notice, that we never used

any information about whether the theory is unitary or not.

as a result we nd that our theory is conformal. it also follows from (3.6) that the

central charge is equal to (2) for both left and right virasoro algebras, indeed

ht (z)t (w)i =

1

(z  w)4 .

(3.8)

finally, we can extend our results on correlation functions that can be computed

exactly. suppose that we want to compute a correlation function which is invariant only

14

under one of the gl or gr and is an invariant tensor under the action of the other. it
turns out that if this tensor is of the rank two, we can still do computations as in the free

theory. there are no invariant tensors of rank one. the only rank-two tensor is the metric,

so the correlation function is proportional to it. to nd the coecient of proportionality
we can contract those two indices with the inverse metric, which gives c times gabgab = 2.
the correlation function thus becomes invariant and can be computed in the free theory

just as before.

3.3. some examples of perturbative calculations

the psl(n|n) is a conformal theory and therefore all elds can be decomposed into
it
represenations of the virasoro algebra. the current j is an interesting example.
satises the equation of motion j  = 0 and is not holomorphic. on the other hand one
can suggest that the current component jz (or jz) is a (1, 0) (or (0, 1)) conformal primary
eld. notice that the theory in question is not unitary and therefore the zero norm states
(such as jz) do not decouple. the currents are invariant with respect to either left or right
multiplication symmetry and therefore one can analyze multipoint correlation functions of

left (or right) currents using perturbation theory. for example, the two point correlation

function of currents is known exactly

hja(x)jb(y)i =

2gab
(x  y)2

(3.9)

as was explained before, all loop diagrams (in other words, diagrams with interaction

vertices) that may contribute to this calculation have two external lines and therefore

vanish identically. the 3-point correlation function is almost uniquely xed by conformal

invariance

hja(x)jb(y)jc(z)i =

3
2

4fabc

(x  y)(x  z)(y  z)

,

(3.10)

modulo the scale coecient that we claim is exactly equal to 34/2. let us present the

arguments that this is an exact answer. consider the feynman diagram that contributes to

(3.10). it contains three-vertices coming both from the expansion of the currents (3.3) and

from the interaction vertices. diagrams containing only one three-vertex come from the

second term in the current and give (3.10). we claim that any feynman diagram containing

two or more three-vertices vanishes. to show this let us pull out the three-vertex where

the external line enters. the rest of the diagram is a blob with four external lines (see

fig. 5). the group structure of this blob is a rank 4 invariant tensor. let us contract

15

any of its two indices. the resulting graph contains a three-vertex inside and vanishes by

our previous arguments. therefore the blob is a traceless rank 4 tensor. there are only

ve independent rank 4 invariant tensors: gabgcd and two other tensors with indices being
rfbdr. only three combinations of those are
permuted (three in total) and fab
rfbdr and gabgcd + gacgbd + gadgbc. luckily, for all of the traceless
traceless: fab
tensors the contraction of any two indices with the structure constant fabc produces zero.
this explains why (3.10) is exact.

the higher point correlation functions are nontrivial and have complicated  depen-

dence. for example on the general grounds one can conclude that

hja1 (z1)ja2 (z2)ja3 (z3)ja4 (z4)i = 4i<j(zi  zj )2/3xk

t(k)
a1...a4fk(x)gk(x),

where t(k) are possible tensor structures and x is an anharmonic ratio. this correlation
function is clearly not holomorphic. notice, that 4 is just a normalization factor. the

functions fk(x), gk(x) also have a non-trivial dependence on .

3.4. comments on the wzw term

in the previous sections we proved a remarkable statement  the principal chiral
eld for psl(n|n) is a conformal theory. there is another well known way to associate a
conformal eld theory with any group (allowing a non-degenerate invariant second rank

tensor)  wzw theory [24] [25]. the action for wzw theory is just a combination of

principal chiral action and a wzw term. the theory is conformal (and possesses the
ane symmetry algebra) when the coecient in front of the principal chiral action 1
2
coincides with the coecient k in front of the wzw term. if these coecients are dierent

the theory ows, or in other words it is not conformal.

for psl(n|n) group the story is dierent. the theory is conformal for any values of k

and 

swzw[g] =

1

42 z str(cid:0)|g1dg|2(cid:1) + kwzw[g] .

(3.11)

16

the proof of this statement is almost identical to the one we just gave for psl(n|n) principal
chiral eld. it is enough to say that all vertices introduced by wzw term have the group

structure which can be described by the similar tree-like diagrams (see fig. 1).

as a result we have a two parameter family of conformal eld theories, parameterized
by two charges k and . for compact groups (or for groups having non-trivial h 3) the

coecient k is quantized, then it is natural to think about parameter  as an exactly
marginal perturbation. at point k = 1/2 the global left/right multiplication symmetry

is enhanced and the theory is invariant under the left/right current algebra. as we see,

the theory still possesses a huge chiral algebra for any value of , which is an extension of

virasoro algebra.

let us see what is the physical meaning of the coecient k in front of the wzw
term and the radius of sigma model r = 1
 in the ads3  s3 applications. the simple
way to realize ads3  s3 geometry is to consider conguration of q ns 5-branes and p
fundamental strings [26]. this conguration can be described by wzw model (see for
example [3]) with 1

2 = kw zw = q. now, performing the s-duality transformation, one
can map this conguration on (qa, qc) 5-branes and (pa, pc) strings (the second integer

indicates the number of d-objects). then the radius of ads, measured in einstein frame,
remains invariant under the s-duality transformation. as a result we end up with 1/2 =

r2 = p(qa)2 + (qc)2g2, where g is the string coupling constant and qc counts the number

of d 5-branes. the coecient in front of the wzw term counts the ns 5-brane charge and
is equal to qa. it was noticed in [12] that for 1/2 < qa the theory becomes ill dened.

4. comments on localization

in this section we give some non-perturbative arguments about p sl(n|n) principal
chiral model. it will add strength to the perturbative calculations of the previous section.

recall that the symmetry groups of our model, gl and gr, are actually supergroups

and as such posses a number of fermionic generators. those generators act without xed
points and because of that we have to break the gl  gr symmetry and dene the model
as a limit of the theory with a unique vacuum, g0. the symmetry that remains in that
latter theory is the diagonal subgroup of glgr. it acts by conjugation (we chose g0 = 1
for simplicity)

g(x)  u g(x)u 1,
17

u  p sl(n|n)

(4.1)

now, p sl(n|n) has 2n2 fermionic generators which can be considered as brst charges.
we split them into two subgroups mentioned earlier, f+ and f

f+ = (cid:18) 1 +
1 (cid:19)

0

f = (cid:18) 1

 1(cid:19)

0

where  are fermionic n  n matrices. both f+ and f are abelian subgroups of
p sl(n|n).

the glgr invariant correlation functions are at the same time brst invariant and
one can localize the path integral to the arbitrarily small neighborhood of a set xed by

the brst action [27]. in our case the generators of the f can all be considered as brst

charges and the only point xed by them is the vacuum state g(x) = 1. thus to evaluate
the path integral in the broken symmetry phase with gl  gr invariant observables
it is sucient to restrict ourselves to the innitesimal neighborhood of the vacuum, i.e.

the gaussian approximation is exact. this conrms what we found earlier by analyzing

perturbation theory. namely, in computing gl and gr invariant correlation functions we
can set sint to zero. in the case of correlation functions invariant only under a subgroup
of gl  gr it is possible to localize the path integral on a bigger set.

the above arguments can also be made in the case of gl(n|m) principal chiral models.
however, it doesnt make those theories conformal. an important ingredient for doing
exact computations in perturbation theory is missing. in the p sl(n|n) case any invariant
diagram containing the three-vertex vanishes, even if the vertex comes not from the action
but from the expansion of the operators. in the case of gl(n|m) this is no longer true
and although the calculations can be made in the free theory, the innite number of terms

arising, for instance, from the expansion of j would all contribute.

5. chiral algebra

as we just demonstrated, the p sl(n|n) principal chiral model is a conformal eld
theory. the central charge is equal to c = 2 and is independent on . as we will see, the
parameter  is very similar to the radius parameter in the free theory on a circle.

it turns out that the chiral algebra of the theory is not just virasoro algebra, but much

bigger. classically, any chiral model contains an innite set of holomorphic currents. to be

more precise, for every invariant symmetric tensor ta1...an one can construct a holomorphic
current

w[t] =

1
n!

ta1a2...anj a1 j a2 ...j an

(5.1)

18

it is irrelevant whether we use the left or the right current in the denition of w[t]. the

equation of motion

j  = zjz + zjz = 0 ,

being combined with the atness condition

yields the relation

zjz  zjz + [jz, jz] = 0

zjz +

1
2

[jz, jz] = 0

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

it is easy to see that the commutator in the last equation does not contribute to zw[t]

and as a result, w[t] turns out to be holomorphic at the classical level (see for example

[21]). for an arbitrary group g the holomorphicity of the currents w[t] is destroyed by
quantum corrections. however, the case of p sl(n|n) group is very remarkable and we
believe that the currents wn remain holomorphic.

the construction of totally symmetric invariant tensors is given in the appendix. here
we just show one example. consider sl(n|n) invariant tensor corresponding to normalized
trace dn(x1, x2, ...xn) = (1/n!)str(x1x2...xn). under u (1) transformation g  eg it
transforms as follows: dn(...) = (1/n)pi dn1(...). given this, it is easy to see that

for every n one can construct an invariant tensor of degree 2n

t2n 

1
2

d2

n +x(1)idnidi

(5.5)

each psl(n|n) invariant tensor tn gives rise to a holomorphic current w[t] that remains
holomorphic even at the quantum level. one can check this by analyzing the perturbation

theory (we checked the rst few non-trivial orders in perturbation theory). the eld w[t]

is a conformal primary eld of dimension  = rank(t) if tensor t is traceless. this can be

always achieved by subtracting the traces.

the elds {w[t]} generate the chiral algebra of the theory. the rst eld is the stress
energy tensor t = w2, the next ones are w[t6] and w[t8]  t 4/480. for psl(2|2), all other
elds w[t] are in a sense dependent. this dependence is non-polynomial. for example

w[t8]t 2 

2
5

w 2

[t6] 

1

720

t 6 + ... = 0 ,

19

where the dots represent possible quantum corrections. this chiral algebra is an example

of a w -algebra. the ope of w[t6] with itself has the following structure

w[t6](z)w[t6](w) =

c8
66

(z  w)4 [w[t8]] +

c66

(z  w)8 [u ] .

(5.6)

the brackets [x] denote the conformal block of operator x. the eld u is given by a

combination of square of stress energy tensor and its second derivative. in general, for
psl(n|n) theory there are (n  2) independent operators. the algebra generated by these
currents is quite complicated and it would be nice to have some explicit description of this

algebra. for example, it is plausible that this chiral algebra can be obtained by hamiltonian
reduction from psl(n|n) ane algebra. this representation, being constructed, should be
very helpful for representation theory.

6. physical operators and kac representations

6.1. sigma model operators

let us describe operators that appear in the quantization of the p sl(n|n) sigma
model. all elds can be classied by representations of the symmetry group gl  gr,
or in other words, by a pair of weights (l, r) 3. let us denote by v(l,r) a primary
eld of the chiral algebra. observe that all the w[t] can be constructed either from the left
current jl, or from the right current jr. therefore, in order to avoid the contradiction, we

have to assume that the weights (l, r) are not arbitrary but such that all the casimir

operators have the same eigenvalues for both l and r representations.

in this paper we discuss only highest/lowest weight representations. for generic weight

 the kac representation (see denition in the appendix) is irreducible, but for certain

weights  it turns out to be reducible (atypical). the resulting irreducible representation

turns out to be smaller and we call it a short representation. these representations will

play in important role in the ads/cf t duality. they correspond to chiral multiplets in

the boundary theory.

one can easily construct operators corresponding to the weights (,  = ) (both
left and right representations are the same) of p sl(n|n). for our group every lie algebra
3 although not all the representations are of the highest weight type, we would not have the

need for those in our discussion.

20

representation gives rise to the group representation. let t a be the generators of the lie
algebra in the representation  and let aa be the corresponding coordinates on the lie
algebra. then we propose v(,) = eaat a
classically, this eld has zero dimension, but it acquires an anomalous dimension. in the
leading order it is equal to  =  = 2c/2, where c is the eigenvalue of the quadratic
casimir. we conjecture that this expression for the dimension is exact to all orders in .

as a candidate for the conformal primary eld.

let us discuss the correlation functions of these operators. we rst consider two-

point correlation function of a group invariant combination. in order to construct a group

invariant combination of two representations 1, 2, one needs to have a way of pairing two
representations (contracting indices) 4. for two irreducible representations this pairing
exists only if 1 = 
j . then the pairing is just the
supertrace of the product of two matrices. as we know, an invariant two point correlation

2 and in this case (v(,))k

j = (v 1

(,))k

function can be easily computed to all orders in perturbation theory

hstr(v(,)(z)v(,)(w))i =

sdim()
|z  w|22c

(6.1)

unfortunately, this result is not too exciting. the superdimension is equal to zero unless

c = 0. therefore, this correlation function diers from zero only for short representations.
one may try to consider correlation functions of non-invariant operators, for example
v(,)(z)  v(,)(w) (no supertrace). this correlation function is invariant under the
right multiplication and so can be computed around any g0 vacuum. on general grounds
one expects the answer to be of the form

h(v(,))i

k(z)(v(,))k

j (w)i =

n i
j

|z  w|22c

.

(6.2)

to compute the normalization factor n one may project on invariant subsector by taking

a trace. as a result one gets n sdim() = sdim(). therefore it implies that n = 1, if
sdim() 6= 0. in the case when sdim() = 0 we can not justify that n = 1 using this kind
of argument. still, perturbation theory predicts that n = 1.
the correlation function of matrix elements (hv(,))i

ji can not be com-
puted in perturbation theory. however, from the transformation properties of the correla-

k(v(,))k

tion function we expect that

jl
j(w)i = i
k(1)
4 in other words, one has to choose elements in hom(1, 

k(z)(v(,))l

h(v(,))i

2) and hom(

1, 2).

k2

f (z, w)

(6.3)

21

where k is the parity of the vector k in the representation . to compute f (z, w), one can
just evaluate the trace over indices k, l producing a simple relation sdim()f (z, w) = 1/|z
w|2c. for short representations sdim() 6= 0 and at the same time c = 0 (see section
2.2) and we obtain f (z, w) = 1/sdim(). for generic representations these arguments fail

and we do not know how to compute correlation functions of matrix elements.

in fact, we can also discuss the multipoint correlation functions of group invariant

combination of operators. these correlation functions can be computed to all orders in

perturbation theory. again, to dene the three point correlation functions, one needs

clebsch-gordan coecients in order to contract indices. saying it dierently, one has

to x two invariant tensors  and  5. when the choice of  and  is unique, they

are necessarily proportional to clebsch-gordan coecients (as in the case of the classical

groups). this choice xes the gauge invariant combination. now, going through the similar

computations one nds that

h  (cid:0)v(1,1)(z)v(2,2)(w)v(3,3)(x)(cid:1)i =
|z  w|12|z  x|13|w  x|23

h, i

=

,

(6.4)

where 12 = 22(c1 + c2  c3), 13 = 22(c1 + c3  c2), 23 = 22(c2 + c3  c1), cj
is the eigenvalue of the casimir operator on representation j and h, i = pijk ijkijk.
unfortunately, h, i vanishes unless all ci = 0. the group invariant three point correlation
function is not zero only for short representations and in this case it computes pairing h, i.
this pairing is the analog of the square of clebsch-gordan coecients pijk |cijk
|2 for

classical groups.

similar to the two point correlation functions, one can try to dene a three point

correlation function for the individual matrix elements. we can compute these correlation

functions (i) only for short representations and (ii) under the assumption that invariant

tensors  and  are unique (modulo scaling), and in this case they generalize the notion of

clebsh-gordan coecients. observe that two and three point correlation functions turn

out to be coupling independent for short representations.

5 in other words,   hom(1  2, 

3) and   hom(

1  

2, 3) are non-zero if represen-

tation 3 appears in decomposition 1  2.

6.2. strings on ads3  s3 and p su (1, 1|2)

in this section we want to make contact with some physical models, in particular with
strings propagating on ads-type backgrounds. our arguments that p sl(n|n) principal
chiral model is conformal were purely algebraic and independent of the choice of the real
structure of the group. now, to relate our discussion to strings on ads3  s3 we have to
consider p su (1, 1|2) principal chiral eld. similarly, strings propagating on ads5  s5
are related to the coset (1.1) of p su (2, 2|4) principal chiral model.

let us concentrate on the p su (1, 1|2) case. our sigma model is non-unitary and
therefore there is no state operator correspondence. still both states and operators can
be classied by the representations of the symmetry group p su (1, 1|2)l  p su (1, 1|2)r.
each individual weight l, r is nothing else but a pair of su(2) and su(1, 1) weights
l = (, )l and r = (, )r (the weight of su(2) is twice the spin and is always positive
integer   z+). to conform with the physics literature,  denotes the highest weight of
the su(2) while  is the lowest weight, in the sense that it has the lowest eigenvalue of l0.

we have to consider both nite and innite dimensional representations of the sym-

metry group. see for example the discussion of the spectrum of the string theory on
ads3  s3 in [28]. not all of the innite-dimensional representations are highest weight
representations, but we will not have the need for those. the unitary innite-dimensional
representations correspond to normalizable modes in p su (1, 1|2) and non-unitary ones to
non-normalizable. representation ((, ), (, )) is unitary if both s are positive. also

note that for a given representation the sum of the left and right quadratic casimirs is the
eigenvalue of the laplacian on the corresponding modes in p su (1, 1|2).

the generic representation (, ) of psu(1, 1|2) is irreducible. but when  =  or
 = ( + 2) the representation turns out to be reducible 6. in this case the irreducible

representations are smaller (one can nd the discussion of reducible nite dimensional

representations for psl(2, 2) in the appendix).

in the physical language these are the

short representations, similar to those that appear in the description of bps states. for

the future let us denote the unitary short representations with the following weights as
[, ]  ((,  + 2)l, (,  + 2)r).

6 the kac representation is constructed as a product v su(2)



v su(1,1)



c(1, 2, 3, 4), where

v su(1,1)



is a nite or innite dimensional l.w.s module corresponding to weight .

23

the sigma model operators v(,) would enter into the construction of string vertex
operators. for both  and  short representations their quadratic casimirs vanish. we

can write it as

(  ( + 2)  ( + 2))v(,) = 0 ,

(6.5)

where  is the laplacian operator on ads3. this is nothing else but the supergravity mass
shell condition. in other words, operators v(,) correspond to the massless excitations
around the supergravity background. as it was explained in [29], the only representations

arising in supergravity have left and right weights corresponding to the short representa-
tions and their {su(2)l, su(2)r} weights are {, }, {  1, } or {  2, }, where the
smaller weight is positive. this restriction comes from the fact that the supergravity sec-

tor contains elds of spin two at most. larger dierences would correspond to the higher

spin elds. in particular, the short representations with equal su(2) weights correspond

to the modes of massless scalars in supergravity. the weights ((,  + 2), (,  + 2)) labels
normalizable modes, while ((, ), (, )) labels non-normalizable modes which lie in
the highest/lowest weight representations. clearly, the spectrum of the stringy modes is

much more complicated.

the conformal eld theory on the boundary of ads3 possesses left and right n = 4
superconformal algebras. those have left and right p su (1, 1|2)s as nite subalgebras. in-
deed, one can easily identify them: j 3, j  and l0, l1 generate su(2)su(1, 1) subalgebra
and ga
1/2 are the fermionic generators. the chiral multiplets of the boundary
cft then correspond to the short representations of p su (1, 1|2)l  p su (1, 1|2)r. the
two and three-point correlation functions of chiral operators in the boundary theory were

1/2 and ga

computed in [30] [31] and they are given by the coupling-independent (in the appropriate

normalization) expressions proportional to clebsch-gordan coecients. as we found, the

two and three-point worldsheet correlation functions of the vertex operators corresponding

to short representations (, ) are also independent of the coupling and uniquely deter-

mined by the group structure.

to compute correlation functions of boundary cft in ads supergravity, one has to

nd the solution of sugra equations of motion which approaches given boundary values

at innity [32]. consider a massless scalar eld in supergravity. for its kaluza-klein

harmonic lying in the representation with su(2) weight , the apparent mass in ads3
is m2 = ( + 2). for such a scalar the solution approaching a (x) on the boundary

was found in [32]. remarkably, this solution is exactly the lowest weight state in the

24

representation of the ads3 isometry group su (1, 1)l  su (1, 1)r with both weights equal
to  = 1 +1 + m2 =  + 2 [33]. thus it is actually a state of the lowest su (1, 1) weights
in the short representation of the p su (1, 1|2)l  p su (1, 1|2)r which we earlier denoted
[, ]. therefore we can identify the vertex operator representing the same state in v[,] as
the one which corresponds to the insertion of the boundary operator at the origin. let us
call this operator v[,](z, z|0) where z is the world-sheet coordinate and 0 is, in a sense, a
boundary coordinate. we suppress the indices labelling the states inside the v[,] module.
to shift the above operator from the origin, we can, of course, act on it with su(1, 1)

lowering operators l1 and l1 and thus dene

v[,](z, z|x, x) = x xn

n!

xm
m!

[l1, [ l1, v[,](z, z)]] ,

(6.6)

where (z, z) are worldsheet coordinates and (x, x) are now boundary coordinates. notice,

that one can equally well generalize these formulas in the case of dierent left and right

short representations.

clearly the general string amplitudes are given by complicated expressions that involve

ghost elds and worldsheet integrations over positions of vertex operators, but two- and

three- scattering amplitudes are given by simple minded expressions  no ghost elds

and, thanks to worldsheet sl(2, c), no integrations. therefore we can completely neglect

the worldsheet dependence of the correlation functions assuming that our operators are
inserted say at 0 and 1 for propagator and at 0, 1 and  for the three point scattering.
now we can write two- and three-point correlation functions for our vertex operators.

we nd that the dependence on the boundary coordinates produces exactly right scaling

behavior

hv[,](0|x, x)v[,](|y, y)i =

hv[,](0|x, x)v[,](1|y, y)v[,](|u, u)i =



|x  y|2(+2)

t

|x  y|xy|x  u|xu|y  u|yu

(6.7)

,

where xy = (++2), xu = (++2), yu = (++2) 7. the coecients t
are coupling independent (!) and can be computed in terms of clebsh-gordan coecients.

strictly, we can not make computations in the case of innite dimensional representation.

still, morally speaking this answer is very similar to that presented at the end of the

previous section. both answers are coupling constant independent and are expressed in

terms of clebsh-gordan coecients (compare (6.7) and [31]).

7 tensors  and t have suppressed indices that label the states inside representations

25

7. discussion

we believe that by now we have convinced the reader that p sl(n|n) sigma model is
quite remarkable. it gives rise to a conformal eld theory. this conformal eld theory is

non-trivial, but it contains a certain subsector corresponding to short representations that

is easy to analyze. these are short (atypical) representations that correspond to chiral

primary elds in the boundary theory. the long representations are dicult to analyze

and they give rise to stringy modes (in the corresponding string theory). in a sense, the

subsector of short representations is reminiscent to the ground ring of c = 1 model. the

chiral algebra of this sigma model is not just a virasoro algebra but its extension similar

to w algebras. we believe that the study of the representations of this chiral algebra will

be an important ingredient in the solution of the theory.

it follows from our presentation that all group invariant correlation functions are

coupling constant independent, including the higher genus calculations. for example, the

one loop partition function is coupling independent and after eliminating the contribution
of zero modes is equal to z  = 2(q) (this is just a contribution of fermionic (b, c) system).

this partition function does not say much about the spectrum of the theory. it is clear

that various twisted version of one loop partition function would contain more information

about the spectrum. this question is currently under investigation.

apparently there is another innite series of supergroups that have a chance of being
conformal  the osp(2n + 2|2n) groups. this group contains so(2n + 2)  sp(2n) as
a bosonic subgroup. the dual coxeter number vanishes for these groups and therefore

the one loop beta function is zero. we believe that this group has unique rank 3 totally

antisymmetric tensor, which would imply that the theory is exactly conformal. it will be

very interesting to analyze this series.

one can try to go even further. the p sl(n|n) principal chiral model is a generaliza-
tion of the g g sigma model to a case of a very special supergroup. it may be promising
to generalize o(n ) sigma models in a similar way. we only note that the action for such

model looks similar to the action found in [12].

as we already mentioned in the introduction, the p sl(n|n) group manifold is in a
sense a calabi-yau manifold. one of the directions for future work could be the construc-

tion of other supermanifolds that give rise to conformal eld theories. for example, various

quotients over special subgroups also yield the conformal eld theories[34].

there is another observation which is somewhat beyond the scope of this paper but

nevertheless is quite interesting. consider a four dimensional gauge theory based on a

26

supergroup p sl(n|n). in other words, there is no supersymmetry in four dimensions, but
there are two kinds of vector particles  the usual bosonic as well as fermionic. it is a four

dimensional non-unitary theory. it is possible that certain version of this theory might

appear in the description of the system that contains both d-branes and anti d-branes.

now, according to the arguments presented in this paper, this theory is going to be exactly

conformal! there is not much dierence in group structure between two dimensional and

four dimensional feynman diagrams. therefore, we can repeat all the steps of our proof

in the case of this four dimensional theory. still, it is unclear whether one can make sense

out of this theory.

it is a challenge to understand the p sl(n|n) sigma models and we hope to return to

this subject in the future.

8. appendix. representations of psl(n|n)

the simple lie superalgebra psl(n|n) (or a(n 1|n 1) in kacs notation [35]) stands
out among other superalgebras of the a(m|n) series in many ways and is relatively less
studied. here we will discuss some of its features.

first of all, psl(n|n) it is not a subalgebra of the matrix superalgebra gl(n|n) unlike
all other algebras of the a series. indeed, the traceless subalgebra sl(n|n) of gl(n|n) is
not simple since it has a non-trivial center z = c  i generated by the identity matrix
i  sl(n|n). the quotient superalgebra psl(n|n) = sl(n|n)/z is simple for n > 1.

the projection

p : sl(n|n)  psl(n|n)

(8.1)

cannot be split (i.e. psl(n|n) cannot be embedded into sl(n|n) as a subalgebra) and there-
fore sl(n|n) is a non-trivial central extension of the algebra psl(n|n). this is the only series
of basic classical lie superalgebras admitting a non-trivial central extension (the only other

examples being the series of strange superalgebras q(n) and hamiltonian superalgebras
h(n)). this phenomenon places psl(n|n) in one class with the virasoro or current lie
algebras and shows that not every irreducible representation of the matrix superalgebra
sl(n|n) factors through the projection (8.1) and gives a representation of psl(n|n), but only
those with vanishing central charge (the eigenvalue of i).

another peculiarity of psl(n|n) is that it has rank 2n 2 (the dimension of the cartan

subalgebra) and 2n  1 simple roots (i.e. its simple roots are linearly dependent).

before discussing representations of psl(n|n) let us x some notation. since psl(n|n)
does not have a natural matrix representation we will be working with it in terms of sl(n|n)
or gl(n|n) generators keeping in mind that two matrices from sl(n|n) whose dierence is
a scalar multiple of i represent the same element of psl(n|n). the cartan subalgebra hs
of sl(n|n) has dimension 2n  1 and is spanned by elements

hi = eii  ei+1,i+1,
hn = enn + en+1,n+1,

1  i  n  1, and n + 1  i  2n  1 , and

(8.2)

where eij is the elementary matrix whose only non-zero entry is 1 on the intersection of the
1  i  2n generate the cartan subalgebra

i-th row and the j-th column. elements eii
hg of gl(n|n).

28

the remaining part of the root decomposition is the same for both sl(n|n) and gl(n|n)

and is given by the following root vectors and the corresponding roots:

eij ,

en+i,n+j ,

ei,m+j ,

em+i,j ,

i  j,
i  j,
i  j,
i  j,

(8.3)

i, j = 1, . . . , n, where i, i  h 
g are functionals on hg such that i(x) = xi and i(x) =
xn+i for x = diag(x1, . . . , x2n)  hg. the roots i  j and i  j are odd (which means
that the corresponding root vector is odd), the remaining ones are even. the so-called

distinguished system of simple roots is chosen as follows:

i = i  i+1,
n = n  1,
n+i = i  i+1,

1  i  n  1 ,

1  i  n  1 .

(8.4)

with this choice of simple roots, the 2n2 n positive roots of sl(n|n) are eij for i < j,
en+i,n+j for i < j, and ei,m+j. in the distinguished system there is only one odd simple

root n.

there are two dierent ways to represent sl(n|n) weights (i.e. ,elements of h 

coordinates both of which have some advantages. first, we can express   h 
of the basis (8.4)

s ) in
s in terms

2n1

 = [a1, a2, . . . , a2n1] =

aii, where ai = (hi) .

xi=1
s is a quotient of h 

on the other hand, since h 

g by the element

0 =

n

xi=1

i 

n

xi=1

i ,

we can represent  in terms of i and i as

 = (1, . . . , n; 1, . . . , n) =

n

xi=1

ii +

n

xi=1

ii ,

29

(8.5)

(8.6)

keeping in mind that the strings  = (1, . . . , n; 1, . . . , n) and  +  = (1 + 1, . . . , n +
1; 1  1, . . . , n  1) represent the same element in h 
s . the relation between the two
coordinate systems is given by

(1, . . . , n; 1, . . . , n) = [1  2, . . . , n1  n, n + 1, 1  2, . . . , n1  n]. (8.7)

the dual space h  of the cartan subalgebra h of psl(n|n) is a codimension one subspace
of h 
s that consists of linear functionals on hs vanishing on the vector i  sl(n|n). the

equation

i = h1 + 2h2 + 3h3 + . . . nhn  (n  1)hn1  . . .  2h2n2  h2n1,

shows that [a1, a2, . . . , a2n1] belongs to h  if and only if

1 + 22 + . . . + nn + (n  1)n1 + . . . + 22n2 + 2n1 = 0 .

(8.8)

and, therefore,

an = 

n1

xi=1

1

n(cid:0)

iai 

n1

xi=1

(n  i)an+i(cid:1) .

in the (, ) form, the equation (8.8) looks simpler

(i + i) = 0.

xi

the equation (8.8) implies in particular that the simple roots (8.4) of psl(n|n) are not

linearly independent.

since psl(n|n) is a quotient of sl(n|n), every representation of psl(n|n) is automatically
a representation of sl(n|n). the relationship between representations of sl(n|n) and gl(n|n)
is slightly dierent because sl(n|n) is only a subalgebra and not a quotient of gl(n|n)
(which is the case with gl(m|n) for m 6= n). therefore, every representation of gl(n|n) is
a representation of sl(n|n), but the converse is not true in general. however, since every
nite-dimensional irreducible representation of sl(n|n) is a highest weight representation
v, it is determined by a weight   h 
s (which can be considered as a one-dimensional
representation of the cartan subalgebra hs). but every weight   h 
s can be extended
(not uniquely) to a weight   h 
g and thus the action of sl(n|n) on v can be extended
to a gl(n|n)-action. this allows us to work with irreducible representations of psl(n|n) in

30

terms of sl(n|n) or gl(n|n) representations. in particular, every irreducible representation
of psl(n|n) lifts to an irreducible representation of gl(n|n).

let us recall kacs construction of representations of sl(n|n) (which works with some
modications also for other basic classical lie superalgebras). denote l = sl(n|n) and let
l = l1  l0  l1, where

l0 = sl(n)  c  sl(n)

(8.9)

is the even subalgebra of l and l1 the subalgerbras corresponding to upper- and lower-
triangular odd matrices in sl(n|n). pick a representation of the subalgebra l0 and extend
it to a representation of the subalgebra k = l0  l1 by setting l1v = 0. the kac
representation

v = indl

k v = u(l) u(k) v

(8.10)

corresponding to v (also called the kac or induced module) as a vector space is isomorphic

to the tensor product

v ^ l1,

where v l1 is the grassman algebra of the vector space l1.

if we start with an irreducible representation v = v of the even subalgebra (8.9)

corresponding to a a weight vector

 = [a1, a2, . . . , an1, c, b1, b2, . . . , bn1]  h 
s ,

(8.11)

where [a1, a2, . . . , an1] and [b1, b2, . . . , bn1] are dominant sl(n) weights (i.e. all ai and bj
are non-negative integers), then the kac module v () = v has dimension

2n2 y1ijn1

(cid:0)(ai + 1) + . . . + (aj + 1)(cid:1)(cid:0)(bi + 1) + . . . + (bj + 1)(cid:1)

(j  i + 1)2

.

for a generic (typical) weight  the representation v () is irreducible, otherwise it has

a unique maximal invariant subspace u and the quotient representation m () = v ()/u is
irreducible. all irreducible representations of sl(n|n) can be obtained by this construction.
if the kac representation (8.10) is reducible, the weight  is called atypical. this happens

exactly when

ai + ai+1 + . . . + an  an+1  . . .  an+j1 + i  j  n + 1 = 0

(8.12)

31

for some 1  i, j  n. this condition means that at least one of the inner products

vanishes, where ij = i  j a positive odd root and

h + |iji

 = [1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 1, . . . , 1] =

1
2

(2n  1, 2n  3, . . . ,2n + 1)

(8.13)

is the half-sum of the positive roots.

in terms of the gl(n|n) coordinates (8.6) the condition (8.12) can be rewritten as

i + j + n  i  j + 1 = 0 .

(8.14)

for example, the kac representation v () of sl(2|2) with  = [a, c, b],
atypical if c is equal to one of the following

a, b  z+ is

0, a  1, b + 1, b  a.

(8.15)

now when does a highest weight representation of sl(n|n) descend to a representation of
psl(n|n) via projection (8.1) ? this happens when the weight  belongs to the subspace
of h  given by the constraint (8.8). this gives the following equation for the component

c of the weight (8.11)

c = 

n1

xk=1

1

n(cid:0)

kak 

n1

xk=1

kbnk+1(cid:1) .

(8.16)

therefore, irreducible representations of psl(n|n) are determined by a pair of sl(n) weights
 = [a1, . . . , an1] and  = [b1, . . . , bn1].

this shows another feature of psl(n|n) that distinguishes it from other algebras of the
a type (and from most of other simple lie superalgebras)  its irreducible representations
depend on 2n 2 integer parameters and do not have continuous parameters. (irreducible
representations of sl(m|n) with m 6= n can be deformed, because there are no restrictions
on the coordinate c of the highest weight.)

in the psl(2|2) case for example, we have from (8.16) that c = (ba)

2

condition (8.15) now becomes just a = b. the kac module v is reducible when  =
[a, 0, a]. let us denote the corresponding irreducible representation by ma. if a 6= 0, 1 the
structure of the module v is very simple, namely

and the atypicality

ma  ka  v ,

32

(8.17)

where v/ka = ma and ka/ma = ma+1  ma1.

for psl(3|3) there are six dierent types of atypicality some of which can happen

simultaneously:

a1 + 2a2  2a4  a5 = 0,
a1 + a2  a4 + a5 = 0,
2a1 + a2 + 2a4 + a5 + 2 = 0,

9. appendix. casimir operators of psl(n|n)

the algebra of casimirs  the center of the universal enveloping algebra  for any lie

superalgebra l with an invariant inner product is isomorphic to the algebra of invariant

polynomial functions on l. for classical matrix lie superalgebras this algebra i(l) of

invariants is well studied (see, e.g.

[36]). an analog of the classical chevalleys theorem

describes i(l) in terms of restrictions of the invariant polynomials to the cartan subalgebra
h of l. for l = sl(n|n) for example, i(l) is generated by polynomials tn where tk(x) =
str(x k) for x  sl(n|n)
k = 2, 3, . . . . only the rst 2n 1 functions tk are algebraically
independent, the rest being rational functions of the rst 2n  1 ones. however, when
n  , all tk become algebraically independent.

the case of psl(n|n) is more interesting and dicult. since every invariant polynomial
on psl(n|n) is also an invariant polynomial on sl(n|n), the algebra of casimirs for psl(n|n)
is a subalgebra a of b = c[t1, t2, . . . , tk, . . .] that consists of all polynomials in t1, t2, . . .
that can be pushed to a well-dened function on psl(n|n), i.e.

a = {f  b|f (x + ki) = f (x),

for any x  sl(n|n) , k  c} .

(9.1)

this is a rather strong condition and a priori it is not even clear whether any non-constant

function with this properties should exist.

it turns out, however, that the algebra a of casimirs for psl(n|n) is quite large and

has a rich and interesting structure.

first, it is easy to check that the quadratic polynomial t2 belongs to a. it corresponds

to the invariant inner product on psl(n|n).

to construct new casimirs of higher order let us consider the following formal power

series in innitely many variables s1, s2, . . .:

f (x; s1, s2, . . .) = str(es1x )str(es2x ) . . . .

(9.2)

if only nitely many, say the rst p, of the variables s1, s2, . . . are non-zero and pp

0 , then, obviously,

k=1 sk =

f (x; s1, s2, . . .) = f (x + ki; s1, s2, . . .).

therefore, the coecient c(a1, a2, . . . , ap1) of f at sa1
s1, s2, . . . , sp1 belongs to the algebra of casimirs a.

p1 after expanding f in

for example,

c(2p) = 2d2d2p2  2d3d2p3 + . . . + (1)pd2
p ,

(9.3)

where we set dk = tk/k! so that str(esix) = pk2 sk

i dk, since t0 = stri = 0 and t1 =
strx = 0. analogously we have invariants with more terms in the products, for example

c(p, 2q) = x0ip x0j2q

(1)p+2qijcp+2qij

pi

didjdp+2qij

and, in particular,

c(3, 6) = 3d2

2d5 + 3d2d3d4  d3
3 .

here is the simplest example of an invariant involving products of four tis that does not
belong to the subalgebra generated by c(2p) and c(p, 2q):

c(3, 4, 8) = 252d3

2d9 + 252d2

+ 68d2d3d4d6  30d2d3d2

2d3d8  98d2
5  d2d2

2d4d7 + 30d2
4d5 + 3d3

2d5d6  77d2d2

3d7
3d4d5 + d3d3
4 .

3d6  3d2

(9.4)

it can be proved that the whole algebra of casimirs is generated by t2 and the invari-

ants

c(a1, a2, . . . , am1, 2am) with 3  a1 < a2 < . . . < am1  am .
the leading in the lexicographical order of this invariant is da1 da2 . . . dam1 d2

am.

(9.5)

for psl(2|2) we have t2k+1 = 0, and therefore, all invariant polynomials have even
degrees. in this case, the invariants t2 and c(6) are algebraically independent, while all the
other are rational functions of these two. for example,

t2
2c(8) =

t4
2c(10) =

2
5
3

c(6)2 +

c(6)3 +

t6
2 ,

(9.6)

for n  2 only 2n 2 of the invariants (9.5) are algebraically independent, but for n  
they become algebraically independent, and a a free algebra with innitely many genera-

tors.
