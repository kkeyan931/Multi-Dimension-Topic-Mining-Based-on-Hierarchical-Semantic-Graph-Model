abstract

we develop a theory of non-relativistic bosons in two spatial dimensions with

a weak short range attractive interaction.

in the limit as the range of the

interaction becomes small, there is an ultra-violet divergence in the problem.

we devise a scheme to remove this divergence and produce a completely nite

formulation of the theory. this involves reformulating the dynamics in terms

of a new operator whose eigenvalues give the logarithm of the energy levels.

then, a mean eld theory is developed which allows us to describe the limit

of a large number of bosons. the ground state is a new kind of condensate

(soliton) of bosons that breaks translation invariance spontaneously. the

ground state energy is negative and its magnitude grows exponentially with

the number of particles, rather than like a power law as for conventional many

body systems.

there is a well-known theory of bose gases in one dimensional space with

a delta-function interaction [1,2]. however the two-dimensional bose system

with attractive delta-function interactions is logarithmically divergent even

in the case of two bodies [3,4,6,7]. the hamiltonian of the theory is scale

invariant so that the ground state energy is either zero or negative innity;

in the case of attractive interactions it is negative innity. the two-body

problem has been intensely studied even beyond perturbation theory and it

is now understood how this divergence can be removed by a renormalization.

recently we extended this analysis to the case of the three body problem;

while not exactly solvable, the problem can be reformulated in a nite form

without using perturbation theory [7].

in this paper (for a more detailed discussion see ref. [8]) we will describe

a non-perturbative, fully renormalized formalism for the corresponding non-

relativistic eld theory; i.e., the case of an arbitrary number of bosons. we will

then develop a mean eld theory to obtain the ground state of the system.

the results are striking: the ground state is a new kind of condensate (or

soliton, a bound state of a large number of particles) of bosons, which breaks

translation invariance spontaneously. moreover, the binding energy grows

exponentially with the number of particles.

of course, such a study of the binding of bosons is only possible because

we now have a non-perturbative renormalization method for this theory. this

bosonic eld theory is asymptotically free (i.e., the running coupling constant

decreases logarithmically with energy) and hence provides a good testing for

our new ideas of renormalization [8]. these ideas apply also to other asymp-

totically free theories such as the two-dimensional non-abelian thirring model

[9] and perhaps, even to four dimensional gauge theories such as quantum

chromodynamics.

we begin with the naive hamiltonian of the system of bosons with an

attractive self-interaction of zero range [2]:

here, (x) is a complex scalar eld in two dimensional space satisfying the

usual canonical commutation relations; (p) = r eipx (x)dx is its fourier

in the units we are using,  has dimensions of (length)1 and

transform.

h has dimensions of (length)2; it follows that the coupling constant g is

dimensionless. this means that the lowest eigenvalue of h (in a sector with

xed number of particles ) is either zero or innite. if g > 0, corresponding to

an attractive potential, it is known that the ground state energy is  even
in the case of two particles [6].

following the standard ideas of eld theory, we must regularize the prob-

lem by, for example, introducing a cut-o in the momentum; also, the coupling

constant must be made a function of the cut-o in such a way that the ground

state energy is nite. this is not always possible; for example the analogous

problem in three dimensions requires an innite number of coupling constants

to be adjusted this way. when it is possible to remove all the divergences, by

making a nite number of coupling constants depend on the cut-o, we say

that the theory is renormalizable. we will show that our bosonic eld theory

in two dimensions is renormalizable. moreover, we will produce a completely

nite reformulation of the theory without the use of perturbation methods.

this allows us to ask questions about the bound states of the system, even

the bound state of a large number of particles. a more detailed account of the

methods used is in ref. [8].

the regularized hamiltonian is, in momentum space,

here  is a cut-o function that is equal to one near the origin in momentum

space and vanishes rapidly at innity. for example we could choose

(p) = (|p| < ).

we will see that this cut-o in the relative momentum is sucient to regularize

the theory.

the solution of a quantum mechanical system is equivalent to determining

the resolvent (greens function) of its hamiltonian. thus we would have an

exact renormalization of our theory if we can construct the resolvent (h 
e)1 in the limit as   . our key result is that such a formula for the
resolvent can be obtained,

we will give below explicit formulas for the operators b and w . this gives

an indirect construction of the hamiltonian of the renormalized theory as the
operator for which r(e) = [h  e]1. we cannot get an explicit formula for
the hamiltonian itself; instead we express its resolvent in terms of the resolvent

of an explicitly known operator, w . the dynamical information about the

system is thus encoded in the integral operator w (the principal operator);

it plays as important a role in our theory as the hamiltonian does in usual

physical theories. once we reformulate the theory this way, the standard

approximation methods of quantum theory can be applied to the principal

operator. later on we will in fact apply mean eld methods to get the ground

state energy of the many body system.

the operators h0, b, w involve no dimensional parameters; the only

parameter in the theory is . for example the bound state energy levels of

the system are given by the eigenvalues wa of w :

4

ea = 2e2wa.

(7)

once we determine one eigenvalue, it xes  and then all other eigenvalues
are determined. for example, 2 is the ground state energy of the two-
body system; once we know that the ground state of the n-body system for

any n is determined. the original dimensionless coupling constant has been

traded for the dimensional constant  in the process of renormalization: this

is dimensional transmutation [10].

in order to get the above formula for the resolvent, we have to overcome

some technical diculties. the coupling constant appears in h multiplica-

tively, which makes it dicult to perform a renormalization except, of course,

in perturbation theory. we will introduce some auxilliary variables that will

help us to rewrite the the theory in such a way that coupling constant ap-

pears additively rather multiplicatively. this is key to our method for exact

renormalization. dene creation-annihilation operators (p), (p) satisfying

the product (not commutation relations)

(p) (p) = (2)2(p  p),

(p) (p) = 0 = (p) (p).

(8)

in addition, these operators commute with the bosonic elds. these rela-

tions are the q  0 limit of the q-oscillators studied by many authors (e.g.,
[11]). these relations have an obvious representation on c  l2(r2): there
is an empty state |0 > and states containing one auxilliary particle such as
r v(p) (p) dp
(2)2 |0 >. since the product of the creation operators vanish,
there can no more than one such particle in any state: far more restrictive

than the pauli exclusion principle for fermions. we dont have to attach a

physical signicance to these new auxilliary particles: they can be viewed as

a mathematical device that simplies the analysis. 1

1 however there are examples (quarks or ghosts) of such auxilliary variables that are important

physically as well. we propose that the auxilliary particles created by our operators ,  be called

angels.

on the combined hilbert space b of bosons and the auxilliary particles
(b = b  b  l2(r2), where b) is the usual bosonic fock space), we dene
the operator:

h 

 = h00 +z [dp1dp2dp3](p1  p2)

(p1)(p2)(p3)(2)d(p1 + p2  p3) + h.c.(cid:21) +

1.

here,0, 1 are the projection operators to the subspaces containing zero or

one auxilliary particle respectively:

0 = z [dp](p)(p), 1 = z [dp](p)(p).

we are interested in getting a formula for the resolvent of the hamiltonian

h. we will nd it convenient to think in terms of the auxilliary hamiltonian

h 

 and and the related operator r
let us split the operators into 2 2 blocks according to auxilliary particle

two dierent ways of writing the elements of the inverse matrix will be useful

(the proof is elementary):

hd  ba1bi1

=  = a1 + a1b[d  ba1b]1ba1,

=  = d1 + d1b[a  bd1b]1bd1,

 ba1 =  = d1b.

using the left hand side of the formula for  we can see that

the point of this formula is that it expresses the resolvent of the hamil-

tonian in terms of that of the free theory and the operator (e). moreover,

the coupling constant appears additively in ; we will be able to separate

the divergence in  and remove it by choosing g() to be an appropriate

function of . then the limiting operator (e) = lim (e) will exist.

the roots of the equation (e)|s >= 0 will give the energy levels. thus we
will obtain a completely nite reformulation of the problem: what we have

called elsewhere a transnite formulation. it is important that no where in

this argument we will use perturbation theory.

in more detail, we can use the canonical commutation relations to normal

order the operators in . this will give

by analytic continuation.

this proves the formula (6) for the resolvent.

thus the eigenvalues of the operator w will determine the energy levels.

in fact,

w| >= w| >, e = 2e2w.

(26)

the problem is completely well-posed in terms of the operator w ; it is a re-

placement for the hamiltonian of the theory. in fact there are many subtleties

in the denition of the hamiltonian itself (e.g., domain self-adjointness), all

of which can be avoided by working with w . we call this remarkable new

operator that embodies the dynamics of the system the principal operator.

roughly speaking it represents the logarithm of energy.

now that we have a nite formulation of the theory, we can look for

analogues of all the approximation methods of quantum theory. in particular,

we can look for a mean eld theory. the idea is to use a variational principle

to estimate the lowest eigenvalue of w in the sector with n bosons. now

w acts in the hilbert space of n bosons and one auxilliary particle. the

variational ansatz corresponding to mean eld theory is the one where all the

bosons are in the state u and the angel is in the state v:

|u, v >= z dp1  dpndp

(2)2n+2 u(p1) u(pn)v(p)(p1) (pn)(p)|0 > .

(27)

the expectation value of w in this state becomes (for large n) the principal

function

u =

this u is to be minimized subject to the normalization conditions

(28)

(29)

z |u(p)|2[dp] =z |v(p)|2[dp] = 1.

(30)

if we keep just the leading terms as n  ,

u = n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r v(p1 + p2)u(p1)u(p2)[dp1dp2](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(31)

the functional f1(u) (which is independent of n) can also determined as above,

but it takes a bit more work. thus we have the approximate variatonal

principle for the ground state energy of a system of n bosons:

en = 2 e

2

.

also, c1 is a constant; it is not necessary to determine it for the leading

behavior in the large n limit of energy. we can eliminate v rather easily to

get an equivalent form (written in terms of the position space wavefunction

u(x) = r u(p)eipx dp

(2)2 )):

all the variables in our problem are dimensionless. the minimization of

log i[u] gives the partial dierential equation

where,

r |u|2d2x

,

 = r |u|2d2x
r |u|4d2x

this nonlinear schrodinger equation has been shown to have solutions in

have at least circular symmetry; we get a sort of nonlinear bessels equation:

(38)

with u(x) = rv(r) and r = |x|. it is easy to solve this equation numerically;

we plot the result in the gure. the value of  we get is about 12. the

solution of course breaks translation invariance spontaneously but not rotation

invariance. it is in fact a soliton in the sense of eld theory.

it follows that the ground state energy (binding energy) grows exponen-

tially with the number of particles:

en = 2e



6 n+.

(39)

here, 2 is the binding energy of the two boson system; the dots denote
terms of lower order in the number of bosons. at zero temperature, essentially

all the avaliable particles will fall into this bound state. that is the sense in

which this state is a condensate.

the wavefunction was determined above in terms of a dimensionless po-

sition variable. by putting back the factor |e| we scaled out, we see that
the size of the condensate behaves like |en| 1

2  1e 

12 n; it shrinks with

increasing number of particles. although the results above are asymptotic for

large n, we expect (by analogy with mean eld theory in atomic physics) that

they will hold true even for moderate values of n of about 3 or more.

11

it may be possible to observe such a condensation in cold optical traps

of dilute bose gases, if we can trap the atoms close to some surface [13].

even without a conning potential in the plane of the surface, the atoms will

form a self-trapped bound state. it may be possible to tune the attractive

force between atoms using feshbach resonances [14]. then, even with an

exponentially small size for the condensate, the atoms can be far apart and

the approximation of zero range will be valid. whether large particle numbers

in the condensate can be achieved is not clear yet, however. there might also

be a realization in terms of vortices in superconductors which are on the

boundary between type i and type ii [8].

in the case of the three dimensional attractive bose gas, even after the

above renormalization the energy is not bounded below [8]; our methods fail.

in fact there are indications ( both theoretical and experimental) that in this

case, the system is truly unstable [15,16].
