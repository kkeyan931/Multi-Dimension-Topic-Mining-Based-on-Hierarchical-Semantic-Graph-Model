abstract

we obtain various solutions for d = 4 dipoles and their bound states whose u(1)
elds originate from various form elds in the eective string theories. we oxidize
such dipole solutions to d = 10 to obtain delocalized supergravity solutions for the
brane/anti-brane pairs and their bound states. we speculate on generalized harmonic
superposition rules for supergravity solutions for (intersecting) brane/anti-brane pairs.

1 introduction

due to the recent development in string dualities, our understanding of string theories
has greatly advanced.
initially, the duality relations between dierent string theo-
ries are established by relating the eective supergravity actions (namely the massless
string vibration modes) of string theories through eld redenitions. such duality re-
lations are further extended to the (massive) bps states. the bps states are useful
in establishing and proving the duality relations because of their stability and the ab-
sence of quantum corrections due to the supersymmetry preserved by such states. so,
their properties can be safely extrapolated from weak string coupling to strong string
coupling, thereby allowing test of non-perturbative string dualities, i.e. s-dualities and
u-dualities, and the study of non-perturbative aspects of string theories.

if string dualities are correct, one should be able to establish duality relations beyond
the massless and the bps states. the pioneering work [1] by sen rst established the
duality relations among non-bps states. in perturbative spectrum of a string theory,
there are some stable (due to their being the lightest and therefore unable to decay
to other states) non-bps states , i.e. there are no particular relations between their
masses and their charges, with some conserved quantum numbers. since such states
do not preserve supersymmetry, they receive quantum corrections. nonetheless, due to
their stability such states should be present also in the strong coupling region as non-
perturbative states. the stable non-bps perturbative string states considered in ref.
[1] are the lightest massive perturbative states in the so(32) heterotic string belonging
to the spinor representation of so(32). these states are not bps since the theory that
such states belong to does not have the central charge.
if the duality between the
so(32) heterotic string and the type i theory [2, 3, 4, 5] is correct, then there should
exist the corresponding stable non-bps states with the same quantum numbers within
the non-perturbative spectrum of the type i string theory. such stable non-bps state
with the same quantum numbers in the type i string theory can be identied [6] as a
tachyonic kink solution on the d-string/anti-d-string pair. such solution is shown [7]
to be stable and behave as a d-particle. generally, d-brane/anti-d-brane systems are
useful for studying non-perturbative aspects of string theories beyond the bps regime.
therefore, it is interesting to construct supergravity solutions for brane/anti-brane

pairs. the rst brane/anti-brane pair solution that was constructed is the d6-brane/anti-
d6-brane pair solution in ref.
[8]. sen constructed such solution by embedding the
magnetic kaluza-klein (kk) dipole solutions of ref. [9] into d = 11 supergravity and
then compactifying on s1. such solution is a static and stable conguration because
a net attractive force between the brane and the anti-brane due to the gravitational
and the electromagnetic interactions is cancelled by the repulsive force between the
brane and the anti-brane induced by the external magnetic eld. for supergravity

solutions for the other brane/anti-brane systems, it seems to be a challenging problem
at this moment to construct them. unlike the brane solutions, which can be straight-
forwardly constructed by the solution generating transformations, which induce brane
charges on a charge neutral solution, currently there is not available systematic method
to construct solutions for general brane/anti-brane pairs. even the generalization of
the bonnor-transformation [10], which was used to construct dipole solutions from the
d = 4 kerr solution, and the method used in ref. [9], which constructs the magnetic
kk dipole solution through an euclidean rotation of the d = 4 kerr solution and the
addition of another time coordinate followed by the dimensional reduction, to the case
of general brane/anti-brane systems seems to be not plausible.

in this paper, we shall construct supergravity solutions for various brane/anti-brane
systems and their bound states by embedding d = 4 dipole solutions in einstein-
maxwell-dilaton system into string theories. (refs. [11, 12, 13] also study the related
issues.) although such d = 10 supergravity solutions have only three localized (overall)
transverse coordinates (because these are uplifted from d = 4 solutions), these might
enable one to gain insight on the structure of the complete supergravity solutions or
perhaps to guess the general ansatz for the complete solutions. so, in this paper, we
present a large number of such supergravity solutions for the purpose of revealing the
general patterns for the structure of the solutions. the paper is organized as follows.
in section 2, we summarize general dipole solutions in the einstein-maxwell-dilaton
system and then we construct dyonic dipole solution in the einstein-maxwell-dilaton-
axion system by applying the sl(2, r) transformation to the dipole solution in the
einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory with the dilaton coupling  = 1. in section 3, we dis-
cuss (consistently) truncated string eective action, into which the dipole solutions in
the d = 4 einstein-maxwell-dilaton system are to be embedded, and the symmetries
of such action to be used to generate other d = 4 dipole solutions in the eective string
theory. in section 4, we present various d = 4 fundamental dipole solutions charged
with respect to u(1) elds originated from various form elds in string theories and
then we uplift such solutions to d = 10 to obtain delocalized supergravity solutions
for various brane/anti-brane systems.
in section 5, we construct solutions for non-
marginal bound states of fundamental d = 4 dipoles of section 4 by applying the
transformations in section 3, and then uplift them to d = 10 to obtain the delocalized
supergravity solutions for the non-marginal bound states of brane/anti-brane systems.
in section 6, we construct delocalized supergravity solutions for the marginal bound
states of brane/anti-brane systems with the equal dipole moments by embedding the
d = 4 dipole solutions in the einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory with the dilaton cou-
plings  = 1, 1/3, 0. we learn that such restricted class of supergravity solutions
still satisfy the rules similar to the harmonic superposition rules of the (delocalized
intersecting) brane solutions.

2 dipoles in einstein-maxwell-dilaton system

the gravity solution for the dipole in d = 4 was rst constructed within the einstein-
maxwell system in ref. [10] by applying the bonnor-transformation to the complexied
kerr solution. later, the magnetic dipole solution in the ve-dimensional kk theory
was constructed in ref. [9] through an euclidean rotation of the kerr solution followed
by the addition of a new time coordinate and the dimensional reduction. in this section,
we summarize the d = 4 dipole solutions that generalize these dipole solutions.

we consider the dipole solutions in the following general einstein-maxwell-dilaton

system in d = 4:

s =

where  is the d = 4 dilaton and  is the dilaton coupling parameter to the u(1)
eld strength f . the cases  = 0,3 respectively correspond to the einstein-maxwell
in particular,
system and the d = 5 kk theory considered in refs.
in the case where  = 3, 1, 1/3, 0, this action can be embedded as the eective
supergravity action for string theories [14], thereby allowing the study of the solutions
to the equations of motions for such action within the context of string theory.

[10] and [9].

the  = 0 and  = 3 cases respectively correspond to the dipole solutions constructed
in ref. [10] and ref. [9].

the solution (2) describes a pair of dilatonic 0-brane [17] and anti-0-brane separated
by the distance 2a. the endpoints of such dipole are located at (r, ) = (r+, 0) and
(r+, ), where r+ = m +m2 + a2. generally, the solution (2) has a singularity at r =
r+ due to the conical decit along the line r = r+. furthermore, the horizon of the each
hole at one end point of the dipole is deformed due to the eld created by the other hole
on the other end. therefore, in the near-region of the endpoints of the dipole, the metric
(2) takes the form of the deformed near-horizon metric of the 0-brane (or anti-0-brane)
due to the conical singularity. nevertheless, the solution (2) can still be interpreted
as pair of 0-brane and anti-0-brane kept separated by struts or strings [15, 11]. in the
case of the magnetic kk dipole solution of ref. [9], the conical singularity at r = r+ is
removed by identifying points under a combined spatial translation (along the internal
coordinate direction) and rotation.
in fact, such transformation on the minkowski
spacetime (in cylindrical coordinates) leads to the space with an innitely long straight
magnetic ux tube after the dimensional reduction and the proper denition of new
angular coordinate [18, 19, 20]. this is the kk generalization of the melvins magnetic
universe [21] and is also constructed previously in ref.
[22]. this fact was properly
observed in ref. [7]. the resulting solution near the endpoints of the dipole approaches
the near-horizon solutions for the monopole and the anti-monopole. in this case, it is
the net repulsive force due to the external magnetic eld that keeps the monopole
and the anti-monopole pair apart. another way 2 to introduce a uniform magnetic
eld into a solution is through the ehlers-harrison transformation [23]. the ehlers-
harrison transformation was generalized to the einstein-maxwell-dilaton system (1) in
ref. [18]. in ref. [13], this generalized ehlers-harrison transformation was applied to
the dilatonic dipole solution (2) to construct the solution for the dilatonic 0-brane/anti-
0-brane pair in the external magnetic eld. there, it is shown that with the proper
strength of external magnetic eld the singularity of (2) at r = r+ disappears and
the metric near the end points (r, ) = (r+, ) and (r+, 0) respectively approaches the
near-horizon metrics of the dilatonic 0-brane and anti-0-brane.

in the  = 1 case, one can generalize the above dipole solution in the einstein-
maxwell-dilaton system to the dyonic dipole solution in the einstein-maxwell-dilaton-
axion system. the action (1) with  = 1 is a special case of the following action for

this dyonic dipole solution is also constructed in ref. [11] with the dierent parametriza-

3 symmetries of eective string theories

in this section, we discuss the symmetries of the eective string theories for the purpose
of xing notations for solutions. for special values of the dilaton coupling , the action
(1) for the einstein-maxwell-dilaton system can be embedded as the eective theory
of string theories. thereby, one can study a general dipole solution (2) with (3) and
its duality related solutions within the framework of string theories. the following
eective supergravity action for the massless ns-ns sector is common to the heterotic,
type-iia and type-iib string theories:

s =

1
22

10 z dx10q g e

(cid:20)r g + m m  

1
2  3!

hm n p h m n p(cid:21) ,

(12)

where  is the d = 10 dilaton and hm n p is the eld strength of the ns-ns 2-form
potential bm n .

if one assumes the kk ansatz for the metric of the form ( gm n ) = diag(g,  mn)
(,  = 0, 1, ..., 5; m, n = 6, ..., 9) and let bn = 0 = b mn, then the eective action (12)

6

is compactied to the following d = 6 action:

s =

1
22

6 z dx6g e(cid:20)rg +

2  3!

h h  (cid:21) ,

(13)

where  =  is the d = 6 dilaton and h  is the eld strength of the ns-ns 2-form
potential b = b. note, such dimensional reduction is a consistent truncation of
the d = 10 superstring eective action.

we further compactify the d = 6 action (13) down to d = 4 by using the following

ansatze for the elds:

 gmn am

g = (cid:18) eg + am
b = (cid:18) b + 1

where the indices run as ,  = 0, ..., 3 and m, n = 4, 5, and e  e/det gmn = e+

is the d = 4 dilaton. we parametrize the scalars gmn and bmn in the following way:

(14)

(15)

(16)

(18)

gmn = e(cid:18) e2 + c2 c
1 (cid:19) ,

c

bmn = bmn,

and we hodge-dualize the eld strength h to dene the d = 4 axion a:

a = geggg h .

in terms of the real scalars dened above, we further dene the following complex
scalars:
s = s1 + is2  a + ie, t = t1 + it2  b + ie, u = u1 + iu2  c + ie, (17)
where s is the dilaton-axion eld, and t and u are respectively the kahler struc-
ture and the complex structure of t 2 and can be expressed as the following sl(2, r)
matrices:

the value  = q(4  n)/n = 3, 1, 1/3, 0. the dipole solution with  = q(4  n)/n
is therefore interpreted as the bound state of n fundamental dipoles with the dilaton

the type-iib theory to the dipole solutions carrying the dipole moments of the u(1)
elds originated from the ns-ns 2-form eld to obtain the dipole solutions carrying
the dipole moments of the u(1) elds originated from the rr 2-form eld. the bosonic

the sl(2, r) symmetry of the eective action is manifest in the einstein-frame (with

to compactify the string-frame action (23) down to d = 6, similarly to the previous
case, we use the simplied eld ansatz where (spacetime and internal space) mixing
components of elds are zero and only internal space components of the rr 4-form
potential d are non-zero. however, unlike the previous case, we take the kk ansatz
for the d = 10 metric gm n to be ( gm n ) = (g, e g mn). the resulting d = 6 action

4 fundamental dipole solutions

in this section, we write down fundamental dipole solutions, which we dene as
dipole solutions with either electric or magnetic component of only one u(1) gauge
eld non-zero. in this case, the corresponding d = 4 string eective action (19) can be
transformed to the form (1) with the dilaton coupling  = 3 through eld redenition.
so, the einstein-frame metric g is given by (2) with  = 3, which can also be check
by applying the various z2 subset duality transformations to say kk dipole solutions:

gdxdx = s r2  2mr  a2 cos2

r2  2mr  a2 + d2#

(31)

in the following, we show the explicit expressions for the other elds for various cases
of fundamental dipoles.

the case where only the magnetic component of the kk u(1) gauge eld a3

 = a5

is non-zero corresponds to the d = 5 kk magnetic dipole solution constructed in
ref.
[9]. in terms of the eective string theory eld parametrization, the solution is
rewritten as follows:

(32)

when a3
terms of the elds of the eective string theory as

 = a5

 is electric, the corresponding solution (2) and (3) can be rewritten in

 =  =  =

t = a5

(33)

with the real scalars having the opposite signs to the magnetic case. this is the kk
electric dipole solution, which is the electric-magnetic dual to the solution in ref. [9].
the remaining kk dipole solutions whose kk u(1) elds come from the other circle

10

are obtained by applying the z2 subset of the sl(2, r)u transformation (20) to the
above solutions (32) and (33). note that the z2 subset of sl(2, r)u maps the kk
[winding] u(1) eld of one circle to the kk [winding] u(1) eld of the other circle, while
changing the sign of the real scalar  of the complex structure u. so, the remaining
kk dipole solutions are

the z2 subset of the sl(2, r)t transformation (20) maps the kk electric [magnetic]
u(1) eld of one circle to the winding electric [magnetic] u(1) eld of the other circle
and vice versa, while changing the sign of the real scalar  of the kahler structure t .
by applying this z2 transformation to the above kk dipole solutions, one obtains the
winding dipole (or h dipole) solutions. the magnetic h dipole solutions are

these h dipole solutions can also be obtained by applying the z2 subset of the s-
duality transformation (21), which maps the kk electric [magnetic] eld of one circle
to the h magnetic [electric] eld of the same circle and vice versa and changes the sign
of the real scalar  of the dilaton-axion eld s, to the kk dipole solutions.

the parametrization of scalars of the above fundamental ns-ns dipole solutions
in terms of the internal metric gmn is achieved by using eq. (14), namely (gmn) =
diag(e, e). and of course the d = 4 dilaton is .

from the expressions for the d = 4 dilaton  in the above ns-ns fundamental dipole
 = eg for all the electric ns-

solutions, one can see that the string-frame metric gstr
ns fundamental dipole solutions has the following form:

gstr

 dxdx =   r2  2mr  a2 cos2 
+(r2  2mr  a2 cos2 )"
+(r2  2mr  a2) sin2 d2,

r2  a2 cos2 

! dt2
r2  2mr  a2 + d2#

dr2

(40)

and for all the magnetic ns-ns fundamental dipole solutions the string-frame metric
is given by:

gstr

 dxdx = dt2 + (r2  a2 cos2 )"

+

r2  a2 cos2 

r2  2mr  a2 cos2 

dr2

r2  2mr  a2 + d2#
(r2  2mr  a2) sin2 d2.

(41)

the z2 subset of the sl(2, r) s-duality transformation (26) of the type-iib theory
interchanges the ns-ns 2-form potential b(1)
m n = bm n and the rr 2-form potential
b(2)
m n . so, by applying this z2 transformation to the h dipole solutions, one obtains
the dipole solutions charged with respect to the u(1) eld ba
3+a, originated from
the rr 2-form potential b(2)
m n , which we name as d dipoles. note that in the h dipole
solutions in eqs. (36)  (39) the scalar g is zero, i.e. g mn =  mn. under the sl(2, r)
transformation (26) to these h dipole solutions, the scalar g is induced in such a way
that the combination g = g  /4 is invariant. such z2 transformed solutions have
the same einstein-frame metric as the ns-ns fundamental dipole solutions in the
2 ln det gij and the internal metric gij  g3+i,3+j
above, but the d = 4 dilaton    1
(i, j = 1, ..., 6) dier. the solutions are

einstein- and string-frame metrics have the same form.

4.1 higher-dimensional embeddings

by uplifting the fundamental dipole solutions constructed in the above to d = 10, one
can obtain the supergravity solutions for brane/anti-brane pairs in d = 10. although
for such solutions some of the transverse directions are delocalized, one may be able to
learn about the complete solutions from such delocalized solutions. of course, one can
compactify such delocalized transverse directions of the solutions for the brane/anti-
brane pairs and their bound states presented in this subsection and the following section
to obtain completely localized solutions in d < 10.

5 non-marginal bound states of fundamental dipoles

by applying the sl(2, r) transformations in section 3 to the fundamental dipole so-
lutions presented in section 4, one can construct the supergravity solutions for non-
marginal bound states of fundamental dipoles.

first, we consider the non-marginal bound states of the (electric or magnetic) kk
and h dipoles whose u(1) elds are associated with dierent circles. the einstein-
frame metric g is given by eq. (31), and the string-frame metric gstr
 is given by

16

(40) for the electric case and eq.

eq.
(41) for the magnetic case. we apply the
sl(2, r)t transformation (20) to the fundamental electric kk dipole solution (33) to
construct the supergravity solution for the non-marginal bound state of the electric

kk and electric h dipoles. we use t = (cid:18) cos   sin 

cos  (cid:19) as the so(2)  sl(2, r)t

transformation matrix. the resulting solution has the following form:

elec of this solution are

m = m = q(m cos )2 + (m sin )2,

pkk
elec = ma cos ,

pwind
elec = ma sin .

(56)

the expressions for the adm mass and the dipole moments for the remaining cases in
the following have the similar forms as eq. (56). so, we shall not write down them for
the remaining cases. in the case when the u(1) elds are magnetic, the solutions are
as follows:

the solutions for the case when the kk [winding] u(1) eld comes from the 4-th [5-th]
coordinate are obtained by just applying the z2  sl(2, r)u transformation to the
above solutions. the resulting solutions have the opposite sign for , and a5
 and b4
respectively replaced by a4

 and b5.

similarly, one can apply the so(2)  sl(2, r)u transformation (20) (with the same
transformation matrix as above) to the fundamental electric [magnetic] kk or h dipole

17

solution to construct the supergravity solution for the non-marginal bound state of two
fundamental electric [magnetic] kk or h dipoles charged with respect to two kk or
winding u(1) elds of dierent circles. for such case, the real scalar  undergoes the
sl(2, r)u transformation and therefore the real part c of the complex structure u is
induced. so, the internal metric gmn becomes non-diagonal (cf. eq.(15)). similarly
as above, the einstein-frame metric g is given by eq. (31), and the string-frame
metric gstr
 is given by eq. (40) for the electric case and eq. (41) for the magnetic case.
the solutions have the form similar to the above. but we write down the solutions for
the completeness. for the non-marginal bound state of two electric kk dipoles, the
solution is given by

the non-marginal bound states of two electric (or magnetic) h dipoles are related to
these congurations through the z2  sl(2, r)t transformation. so, the correspond-
ing solution is given by eq. (58) or (59) with the opposite sign for  and with a4
 and
 respectively replaced by a2
a3
by applying the sl(2, r)s transformation (21) to the fundamental dipole solutions,
one can construct supergravity solutions for the non-marginal bound states of the
electric [magnetic] kk dipole and the magnetic [electric] h dipole whose u(1) elds

 = b5 and a1

the resulting solutions have the opposite sign for . the einstein-frame metric for all
the above cases is given by eq. (31). but since the d = 4 dilaton  has undergone
the sl(2, r)s transformation, the string-frame metric now depends on the so(2)

6 marginal bound states

so far we considered the case of non-marginal bound states of the brane/anti-brane
pairs, in which the harmonic functions of the constituent brane/anti-brane pairs are
related through the so(2) rotation angle  to the modied harmonic function h in
eq. (45) and the overall transverse part of the metric has the form similar to that for
the fundamental brane/anti-brane pair solutions.
in order to gain further insight
on more general structure of intersecting brane/anti-brane pair solutions, one has to
study the case of marginal bound states of brane/anti-brane pairs. such solutions can
be indirectly constructed by uplifting the multicharged dipole solutions in d < 10
eective string theories to d = 10. however, at this stage the construction of such
solutions seems to be a dicult task 3. nonetheless, taking advantage of the fact that
the general dilatonic dipole solution (2) with the special values of the dilaton coupling

 = q(4  n)/n can be interpreted as the solution for the marginal bound state of
n  4 fundamental dipoles in d = 4 string theory with the equal dipole moments,
one can infer the more general cases with non-equal dipole moments from the resulting
uplifted d = 10 solutions for marginal bound states of the brane/anti-brane pairs with
the equal brane dipole moments.

we consider the (consistently) truncated d = 4 eective string action given in eq.
(22). when only n  4 of the eld strengths f i are non-zero and the same, the action
(22) can be transform to the action (1) for the einstein-maxwell-dilaton system with
 = q(4  n)/n. we consider the following cases:

  = 1 case: f 2 = f 3 6= 0 and a1

 = 0. in this case, the real scalars are
 = 0 =  and  6= 0. to bring the resulting action (22) to the form (1) with
 = 1, we dene the dilaton  and the u(1) eld strength f in (1) as

 = a4

 = /2,

f = 2f 2 = 2f 3.

(87)

so, in terms of the elds in the action (22), the dipole solution is given by

when uplifted to d = 10, the solution (100) becomes the following supergravity

one can construct other supergravity solutions for the marginal bound states of the
brane/anti-brane pairs by choosing dierent combinations of non-zero u(1) elds, by
using duality transformations in section 3 or through oxidation to d = 11 followed by
the reduction on s1, just as we did in the previous section. just as in the non-marginal

30

bound state cases studied in the previous section, such solutions will have the form
similar to the supergravity solutions for the delocalized intersecting branes except that
the harmonic functions are modied to h = r2
2mra2 cos2  and the metric components
r2
in the overall transverse space are modied as

a2 cos2 

dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2)

(r2  2mr  a2 cos2 )n

(r2  2mr + m2 sin2   a2 cos2 )n1 "
+(r2  2mr  a2) sin2 d2,



dr2

r2  2mr  a2 + d2#

(104)

for the case when there are n  4 constituents in the marginal bound states of
brane/anti-brane pairs. note, such supergravity solutions correspond to the restricted
congurations which have only three localized overall transverse directions and where
all the dipole moments of the constituent brane/anti-brane pairs are equal.

as we have seen explicitly from the brane/anti-brane pair (bound state) solutions
in the previous sections and this section, the supergravity solutions for the delocal-
ized brane/anti-brane pairs and their bound states (with equal dipole moments for
the case of the marginal bound states) still satisfy the rules similar to the harmonic
function superposition rules [31] of the (delocalized intersecting) brane solutions. one
can summarize the harmonic superposition rules for such solutions as follows:

 the solutions are still expressed in terms of the modied harmonic functions,
each of which is associated with each constituent brane/anti-brane pair. in the
case of the 3-dimensional (overall) transverse space or with only 3 directions of
the (overall) transverse space localized, the modied harmonic function is given
by

h =

r2  a2 cos2 

r2  2mr  a2 cos2 

.

(105)

for the non-marginal bound states of two brane/anti-brane pairs with the (over-
all) transverse space with 3 localized directions, the modied harmonic functions
are

h1 =

h2 =

r2  a2 cos2 

r2  2mr cos2   a2 cos2 
r2  2mr cos2   a2 cos2 

r2  2mr  a2 cos2 

,

,

(106)

where cos2  in the modied harmonic functions can be replaced by sin2 .

 the spacetime metric is constructed in terms of the modied harmonic functions
similarly as the (delocalized intersecting) brane solutions. namely, the overall
worldvolume and the relative transverse components of the metric is given by

31

the at metric times overall factors expressed in terms of the products of the
modied harmonic functions with the appropriate powers (same as the case
of the brane solutions). however, for the (overall) transverse components of
the metric, although the overall factor is expressed in terms of the products of
modied harmonic functions with the same powers as in the case of the brane
solutions, the (overall) transverse space is no longer (conformally) at. namely,
the term (dy)2 in (overall) transverse part (with the coordinates y) of the metric is
replaced by a curved metric. in the case of the 3-dimensional (overall) transverse
space or the (overall) transverse space with only 3 localized directions, the at
metric (dy)2 is replaced in the manner described in eq. (104). for the case of the
non-marginal bound states of two brane/anti-brane pairs, the at metric (dy)2
is replaced as in eq. (104) with n = 1.

 the dilaton is expressed as product of the modied harmonic functions with the

same powers as the (delocalized intersecting) brane solution cases.

this harmonic function superposition rules can be straightforwardly generalized to
the case where there is an external magnetic eld that provides the repulsive force
necessary in the force balance between brane and anti-brane. this can be done by
using the solution constructed in ref.
[13] in place of the solution (2) that we have
used so far in this paper.
in this case, the generalized harmonic function (105) is
modied to

,

(107)

where

h =

r2  a2 cos2 

a

a  r2  2mr  a2 cos2  + 4bmr sin2 

+b2 sin2 h(r2  a2)2 + a2(r2  2mr  a2) sin2 i .

(108)
here, b = 2m/(m + a + m2 + a2)2 is the external magnetic eld, which is tuned in
such a way that the conical singularity at r = r+ disappears. note, when the external
magnetic eld b is zero, a = r2  2mr  a2 cos2 , leading to the previous case with
no external magnetic eld. and the (overall) transverse space is modied as

dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2)

an

(r2  2mr + m2 sin2   a2 cos2 )n1 "
+(r2  2mr  a2) sin2 d2,



dr2

r2  2mr  a2 + d2#

(109)

for the case when there are n  4 constituents (with the equal dipole moments) in the
marginal bound states of brane/anti-brane pairs.

32

we speculate that even for the full solutions for the (bound states of) brane/anti-
brane pairs these harmonic superposition rules will hold, with the appropriate modied
harmonic functions and (overall) transverse components of the metric.
