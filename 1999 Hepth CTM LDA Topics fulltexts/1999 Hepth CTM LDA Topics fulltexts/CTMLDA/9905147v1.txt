we employ a heat kernel expansion to derive an eec-
tive action that describes four dimensional su(2) yang-mills
theory in the infrared limit. our result supports the pro-
posal that at large distances the theory is approximated by
the dynamics of knotted string-like uxtubes which appear as
solitons in the eective theory.

connement remains an important unsolved problem
in four dimensional yang-mills theory, even though sev-
eral approaches have been developed for explaining it [1].
from the present point of view an interesting one is the
construction of string variables that describe the theory
at large distances [2].
in [3] an explicit string-like de-
composition of four dimensional su(2) gauge eld has
been introduced. wilsonian renormalization group argu-
ments suggest that in these variables the infrared su(2)
yang-mills theory is in the universality class of

s(n) = z d4x (cid:20)(n)2 +

1

e2 (n  n   n)2 (cid:21) (1)

where n is a three component unit vector. the action (1)
supports string-like knotted solitons [4], [5], which sug-
gests that at large distances su(2) yang-mills theory de-
scribes the dynamics of knotted uxtubes. the rst term
in (1) is relevant in the infrared limit, and it is uniquely
dened. the second term is marginal, and it stabilizes
the solitons. even though lorentz invariance permits ad-
ditional marginal contributions, the second term in (1) is
special in the sense that time derivatives appear at most
bilinearly. this ensures that (1) admits a hamiltonian
interpretation and as such it is unique.

in this letter we present a rst-principles heat-kernel
derivation of (1). we start from the su(2) yang-mills
lagrangian

ly m =

1
4g2 t rf 2



(2)

where we decompose the gauge eld as [3]

aa

 = cna + abcnbnc + na + abcnbnc

(3)

1

with c a vector eld and  =  + i a complex scalar.
together they form an abelian higgs multiplet, covariant
under u(1) gauge transformations in the direction na of
the lie algebra su(2). we show that if one integrates
over this multiplet in the path integral, the ensuing ef-
fective action for the unit vector n is in the universality
class of (1). indeed, if we substitute (3) to (2), we get

ly m =

1
4g2 ( [g  h (1  ||2)]2

+ [(v + ih)(d)d + h.c ] )

(4)

where we have dened the u(1) covariant derivative
d =  + ic, and we have dened g =
c  c , and h = n  n   n, and v =
(n)2  n   n. in particular, h 2
 is bilinear in
v ,

h 2

 =

1
3

(v)2  v v

if we then average (4) over (c, ) with < ||2 
 >  we get the lagrangian in (1). further-
more, if we average (4) over n with < h >= 0 and
dene < v >= m2 and set < h 2
 >=  we get the
abelian higgs model

s =

1

4g2 z d4x(cid:8)g2

 + m2|d|2 + (||2  1)2 (cid:9) (5)

these wilsonian arguments [3] are suggestive, but leave
a number of important issues unexplained. for example,
(2) is (classically) scale invariant but (1) is not, and these
arguments fail to explain how the mass scale appears.
for a justication of (1) a rst principles computation is
needed. for this we redene c  gc and   g and
re-write (4) as

ly m =

here it is obvious that the combination v is the natural
order parameter in the eective action that follows when
we integrate over (c, ). furthermore, since the ground
state is both rotation and translation invariant, we con-
clude that the free energy i.e. eective potential can only
depend on the constant part of the trace of v (x). this
prompts us to redene

v (x)  v (x) + m2

(7)

where m is a constant with the dimensions of a mass.
the eective action then admits a derivative expansion
in powers of v (x) around v = m2 and the leading
term in this expansion, the eective potential, depends
only on the rotation and translation invariant m2.

we note that the second term in (1) already appears
in (6) as the second term in its r.h.s.
in order to jus-
tify (1) it is then sucient to show that the rst term in
(1) is induced when we integrate over (c, ). we also
note that the second term in (6) is reminiscent of a higgs
mechanism, see also (5). this suggests the shift   +a
with a some a priori arbitrary complex parameter, the
v.e.v. of the complex scalar . consequently we intro-
duce the parameter 2 = ( 1
g  g|a|2)2 which measures
the deviation of |a| from 1/g, the value of the complex
scalar || for which the second term on the r.h.s. of (6)
vanishes.

we eliminate the u(1) gauge invariance from the
abelian higgs multiplet by selecting the gauge xing term

lgf =

1

2 (cid:18) m 2(v c) + m 2g

(a  a) (cid:19)2

(8)

this is a variant of the conventional r-gauge in sponta-
neously broken gauge theories, with m an arbitrary mass
scale which we need to introduce since in our units the
eld  is dimensionless. the corresponding ghost action
is

lghost =  (m 2 1
g

v  + m 2g|a|2) 

(9)

the integration measure over (c, ) is determined as
follows: we recall that geometrically a4, the space of
all four dimensional yang-mills connections aa
, is an
innite dimensional euclidean space with cartesian at
metric which we write as

ds2  g(a, a) = z d4xd4y 

(x)

ab (x  y)daa

(x)dab

[da]  q daa

similarly, the naive path integral measure over a4 is
an innite dimensional analog of the cartesian measure
(x). geometrically the decomposition (3)
denes an embedding of a surface in a4, and integration
over (c, ) is with respect to the measure that is induced
by this embedding. in order to determine this induced
measure we rst dene n = (cos  sin , sin  sin , cos ).
the natural intrinsic measure for the components in (3)
is then [dc][sin d][d][d][d]. but since (3) is also a
parametrization of a surface which is embedded in a4, in
2 factor
addition we need to account for a jacobian |g|
that emerges from the embedding. this we determine as
follows: we rst evaluate the variation of (3) w.r.t.

2 factor by evaluating the
and then infer the jacobian |g|
determinant of the metric that we read from the corre-
sponding line element ds2. we interpret the result as an
additional contribution to our lagrangian. in a deriva-
tive expansion in powers of v this gives us the con-

tribution lmeasure = ln(cid:2)v2

(x)(cid:3) + . . . where we have

ignored terms that do not contribute at the level of the
gaussian approximation. the lagrangian that we use in
our computation of the eective action is then

lef f = ly m + lgf + lghost + lmeasure

we compute the path integral over the elds (c, , , )
using standard heat kernel expansion. details of the com-
putation are straightforward but somewhat tedious, and
we have used maple to perform symbolic manipulations.
after combining the various functional determinants that
emerge from the gaussian integrations we conclude that
to leading order in a gradient expansion in v the eec-
tive action is

introduce in order to regulate the momentum integral.

we note that the result is manifestly u(1) gauge invariant
i.e. it is independent of the parameters m 2 and  in (9),
as it should.

the evaluation of the momentum integral in (10) is

straightforward. we describe the nal result as

where l(0)(m), l(2)(v) and l(4)(v) are of zeroth, rst
and second order in powers of v , in a derivative expan-
sion. these contributions can all be presented using the
function

and its derivatives, where u = ( m
rameter. we note that the function f (u) is non-negative
and monotonically increasing, with f (u  0) = o(u)
and f (u  ) = o (ln(u)).

for the zeroth order contribution l(0)(m) we have the

following u dependence,

l(0) =

this is the vacuum (casimir) energy in the gaussian

approximation.
multiplying the (uniform) vacuum energy density. the
ground state values of the various parameters in the back-
ground of a constant n can be determined by minimizing
(11). this suggests that we set u = 0 so that (11) van-
ishes. however, we note that for a fully reliable minimiza-
tion one needs to account for certain additional terms. in
particular one needs to include the full ghost contribution
that comes from xing the full su(2) gauge invariance.
for this we need to understand how (3) emerges from the
conventional gauge xing procedure, which is beyond the
scope of the present letter.

the rst-order contribution l(2)(v) yields in the lead-

ing order our desired rst term in (1),

l(2)(u) =

the derivative of f (u) is monotonically decreasing, with
f (0) = 1
in particular, when

2 and f (u  )  0.

u = 0 and the casimir energy (11) vanishes, the coef-
cient in (12) remains non-zero. indeed, since f (u) is
non-vanishing and positive, the coecient in (12) is al-
ways positive and its minimum value occurs for a non-
vanishing value of u. this suggests that in order to locate
the ground state in the background of a nontrivial n we
should select u 6= 0. this means that m 6= 0 and it scales
nontrivially in . but for our present purposes the exact
determination of the ground state value of u, or the scal-
ing of m in  is inessential. here it is sucient to note
that for all u (12) is positive and non-vanishing. this
means we have a mass gap and the rst term in (1) is
present, irrespectively of the exact value of u.

since (12) is infrared relevant and the second, infrared
marginal term in (1) appears in (6), we may already at
this point conclude that (1) is indeed an eective action
that approximates the infrared limit of the su(2) yang-
mills theory. but for completeness we also evaluate the
gaussian correction to the coecient of the second term
in (1). at this point it becomes apparent that there is
certain latitude in the denition of the coecient multi-
plying h 2
 : the natural order parameter for the eec-
tive action is v , and h is but a particular bilinear
combination of this order parameter. there are also var-
ious additional bilinear combinations of v that can be
present, and here we select a particular basis of such bi-
linears that allows us to write the leading contribution
as

for the second derivative we have f (0) =  and
f (u  )  0. depending on the relative value of
parameters, the coecient of h 2
 is typically negative
when u < u0 < 1 and positive when u0 < u < 1 for some
u0 > 0, while the coecient of the second term in (13)
is negative. since the energy density should be positive

in conclusion, we have studied the large distance
structure of four dimensional su(2) yang-mills theory.
by employing a heat-kernel expansion of the eective ac-
tion we have shown that the lagrangian (1) indeed fol-
lows from the decomposition (3) of the gauge eld. our
result supports the proposal made in [3], that at large
distances su(2) yang-mills theory becomes an eective
string theory, where the strings appear as solitons that
are stabilized against shrinkage by their nontrivial, knot-
ted topology. we have also veried that this interpreta-
tion is consistent with the familiar instanton -vacuum
structure of su(2) yang-mills theory.

this yields restrictions on the possible values of the pa-
rameters, and suggests that we should set u > u0. we
note that this resembles the situation in [6]. in analogy
we then conclude that the negative value of the energy
density (13) for some range of parameters is an indica-
tion that higher order terms in the derivative expansion
become important. indeed, one can show that the full
energy density is necessarily positive for all values of the
parameters.

the two terms that are present in (13) are both local
and lorentz-invariant. both are also marginal in the in-
frared, but since the second term in (13) has a fourth or-
der contribution from time derivatives it does not admit a
canonical hamiltonian interpretation. consequently (1)
is unique in the sense that it admits a lorentz invari-
ant hamiltonian interpretation.
in particular we may
view (1) as a hamiltonian that represents the universal-
ity class of infrared su(2) yang-mills theory. but we
have also found that there is some latitude in the de-
nition of the coecient multiplying h 2
 . in modelling
the dynamical details of large distance su(2) yang-mills
theory, it is then necessary to include additional infrared
marginal terms. we note that this is parallel to the sit-
uation in the skyrme model, where one should account
for all three terms with four derivatives.

finally, we verify that (1) together with its knotted
string-like solitons is indeed consistent with certain famil-
iar aspects of non-perturbative yang-mills theory. for
this we remind that in the temporal a0 = 0 gauge yang-
mills instantons interpolate between asymptotic t = 
vacua, classied by 3(s3)  z homotopy classes. the
dierence in the t =  homotopy classes coincides with
the second chern character of the interpolating instan-
ton conguration. for consistency, this picture should
be reected in the topological properties of the knotted
solitons: if we substitute the decomposition (3) in the
three dimensional chern-simons action that counts the
t =  homotopy classes, we nd that for a at a0 = 0
connection the chern-simons action yields the hopf in-
variant of the conguration n,

3(a) = ijkt r{aijak +

2
3

aiajak} =

1
4

ijkcihjk

with hij = jcj  jci = n  in  j n. consequently
there is a relationship between the a0 = 0 instanton
structure of yang-mills theory and the (self-)linking num-
ber of knotted solitons in the eective infrared theory.
in particular, instantons can be viewed as congurations
that interpolate between dierent knotted vacuum con-
gurations in n. we suggest that this relationship is addi-
tional evidence supporting the consistency of the present
interpretation of the infrared structure of su(2) yang-
mills theory.
