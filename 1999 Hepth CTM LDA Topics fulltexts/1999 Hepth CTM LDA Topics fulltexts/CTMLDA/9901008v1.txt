abstract

we study explicit solutions for orientifolds of matrix theory compactied on non-
commutative torus. as quotients of torus, cylinder, klein bottle and mobius strip
are applicable as orientifolds. we calculate the solutions using connes, douglas and
schwarzs projective module solution, and investigate twisted gauge bundle on quo-
tient spaces as well. they are yang-mills theory on noncommutative torus with proper
boundary conditions which dene the geometry of the dual space.

1 introduction

according to the matrix theory conjecture [1][2], discrete lightcone quantization (dlcq) of
m-theory is described by the maximally supersymmetric gauge u(n) quantum mechanics,

where n is the lightlike momentum, or the number of d particles when interpreted as eective
dynamics of d0 branes.

toroidal compactication of m-theory using matrix theory formulation can be performed

by considering d0 brane dynamics on the covering space and imposing periodicity on the
variables [3].
it is shown to lead to yang-mills gauge theory on dual torus [3], when we
consider td with d < 4. additional moduli from winding mode of extended objects in m-
theory should be taken into account when we consider compactication on tori with higher
dimensionalities [4]. also the supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory on t2 is modied
when the three form potential of eleven dimensional supergravity is turned on along the

lightlike direction. it is described by sym theory on noncommutative torus [5, 6]. noncom-
mutative torus t2
 has additional sl(2,z) symmetry, which corresponds to the t-duality
in general it is in mathematical language morita equvalence of
in the dlcq direction.

noncommutative tori [7] which governs the duality of matrix theory compactications with
nonvanishing expectation value of ns-ns two form potential. when compactied on td
the complete duality group is found to be so(d, d|z) [8]. the noncommutative torus td
is dened by d  d two-form , which transforms in adjoint representation with respect

to so(d, d|z). the rank of the gauge group and the magnetic ux numbers together com-
prise spinor representation, which means that under this duality ym theories with dierent

rank of the gauge group are related. various related topics such as d brane dynamics and
noncommutative geometry, morita equvalence of noncommutative tori and the duality sym-
metry of matrix theory action and the bps spectrum are studied further by various authors

[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].

in this paper we study orientifolds of matrix theory compactication. as the simplest but

still very illuminating examples, which are important on their own, we consider orientifolds
of ym on noncommutative t2
. matrix theory compactication on nonorientable surfaces
had been studied in [24] [25] before the noncommutative geometry nature was noted. after
that it was noted that when we introduce the concept of noncommutativity, the dual space
may not be determined uniquely [9]. when we mod out the torus to make cylinder, we can

have the dual space either cylinder of klein bottle. in the same way both cylinder and klein
bottle can be assigned as the dual space of klein bottle. dual space of mobius strip is always

again the same. this kind of ambiguity is rather generic with m-theory and matrix theory
[26, 27][28, 29, 30]. we have to resort to physical arguments to decide which is the right one.

1

we may have to introduce properly chosen twisted sector to cancel the anomaly. for example
we know that matrix theory on cylinder is sym on cylinder with properly chosen twisted
sector elds on the boundary. those correspond to the e8 gauge eld sector introduced on
the end of the world when we consider m-theory compactied on s1/z2. similarly the dual
of klein bottle cant be cylindrical, since it is generically anomalous without twisted sector

elds freedom which m-theory compactication lacks.

in this paper we aim to solve the orientifold compactication equations, rst using the

projective module solution presented in [5], and then we construct twisted gauge bundle on
noncommutative torus and klein bottle.

2 compactication of matrix theory

the procedure of compactication in matrix theory is straightforward. it is the philosophy

of the matrix theory, or d-brane dynamics, that the positions of the d-branes are encoded in
the matrices as the eigenvalues. to realize periodicity we demand the following conditions.

we consider compactication on two-torus in this paper.

x1 + 2r1 = u1x1u 1
1 ,
x2 + 2r2 = u2x2u 1
2 .

(1)

that is, we identify x + 2r with x itself, up to a certain similarity transformation.

there are 8 other directions in matrix theory but they are intact with above similaraty
transformations. so we have as well

x1 = u2x1u 1
2 ,
x2 = u1x2u 1
1 ,
xa = uixau 1

,

i

i = 1, 2, a = 3, ...10.

it is obvious that with matrices of nite size one cant satisfy above conditions. the original

solution [3] was based on the assumption that the translation operators commute

[u1, u2] = 0.

the standard solution is taking ui as the generators of the algebra of the functions on dual
torus t2,

ui = e2irixi.

the particular solutions to eq.(1) are partial derivatives, and general solutions should be
covariant derivatives

x1 = i1 + a1(u1, u2),

2

x2 = i2 + a2(u1, u2).

(2)

looking at ui, we can see that dual space with size ri = 1/ri is created. while x1, x2
become the covariant derivatives on the dual torus, other components become scalar elds
on the dual torus.

in general we can consider the case when the translation operators ui do not commute

each other, but rather satisfy

u1u2 = e2iu2u1.

(3)

the physical meaning of the parameter  was rst studied in [5].

it is the integral of

the three-form potential of eleven dimensional supergravity on a three-cycle including the
lightlike direction,

interpreted as functions on torus again, eq.(3) denes a quantum plane algebra,

 = rz c12dx1dx2dx,

then this gives ym theory on noncommutative torus, on which the multiplication is dened

[1, 2] = 2i.

3 cds projective module solution

we start by reviewing the compactication solution for e2i 6= 1, presented by connes,
douglas and schwarz (cds) in [5]. after we x ui, the general solution has the form of
xi = xi + ai, where xi are particular solutions and ai are operators commuting with ui.
we consider operators on the space of functions on zq  r, where zq = z/qz. we dene
ui as operators acting on function f (s, k) where s  r, k  zq and transforming them as

u1f (s, k) = e2isf (s, k  p),
u2f (s, k) = e2ik/qf (s + 1, k).

they satisfy

and we set  = p/q  . we dene the operators xi as follows

u1u2 = e2i+2ip/qu2u1,

x1f (s, k) = i
x2f (s, k) =  sf (s, k),

,

f
s

(5)

(6)

(7)

and nd they are in fact particular solution, with r1 =  and r2 = 
commutator is

2 . we note their

[ x1, x2] =

2i


r1r2.

(8)

later we will interprete the solution as gauge bundle on the dual space of compactication,
and above particular solution is one with constant curvature.

now we are looking for two independent operators which commutes with both u1, u2,

which will be generators for the gauge eld.

z1f (s, k) = e2is/qf (s, k  1),
z2f (s, k) = eikf (s + , k),

with  = 1

q ,  =  2a

q where ap + bq = 1 and a, b  z. they satisfy

with

z1z2 = e2i

z2z1,

 =

a + b
p  q

.

(9)

(10)

(11)

thus the homogeneous solution of compactied directions ai, and xa for uncompactied
directions are thought to be elds on the dual noncommutative torus with parameter .
above discussion constitutes rough sketch of morita equivalence; u(q) theory on t is
identical to u(1) theory on t, where  and  are related by sl(2,z) transformation (11).
for u(1) theory the two generators z1, z2 will be interpreted as

z m

1 z n

2  ei(m1+n2+mn),

where i are coordinates of the dual noncommutative torus, satisfying

and the general solution of the compactication condition is

[1, 2] = 2i.

x1 = x1 +x cmnzmn,

4 orientifolds of cds solution

4.1 cylinder

(17)

(18)

(19)

in addition to the toroidal compactication condition (1), we impose one more condition to

make it orientifold on cylinder,

mx1m1 = x t
mx2m1 = +x t
1 .

1 + 2r1,

this is matrix theory realization of the involution giving rise to cylinder from torus,

(1, 2)  (2  1, 2).

considering successive transformations we can nd consistency condition, following [9].

u1u2 = e2iu2u1,
1 m = 1mu 1
u 
1 ,
u 
2 m = 2mu2,

mm = 1.

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

all new parameters introduced here are complex numbers with unit magnitude. it is obvious
that 2 can be scaled away by redening u2. it turns out that to have consistent conditions
we can just choose from 1 = 1, = 1. it was found that 1 = 1 corresponds to the case
that the dual space is cylinder, while when  = 1 we have klein bottle instead [9].  seems

to select the gauge group on the boundary, when the dual space is cylinder. we will study
this further in the following sections on quantum bundle.

5

now that we found the solutions for u1, u2 as operators on function over a real number and
zq, our next task here is to nd m. eq.(25) means that when  = 1, m is antisymmetric.
we know that antisymmetric matrices of odd dimensionality cant be unitary. and eq.(23)
amounts to nding unitary transformation between u1 and u t
1 , when 1 = 1. but it turns
out that this cant be done when m is antisymmetric. so we have solutions for only three

cases.

lets begin with the case of (1, ) = (1, 1). the solution is

under which

which means

mf (s, k) = f (s, k),

mz1m1 = z t
1 ,
mz2m1 = z 
2 ,

m(zmn)m1 = (zm,n)t .

(26)

(27)

(28)

so if we identify the operators z1, z2 as generators of u(1) bundle on the noncommutative
torus, functions which are invariant under the projection condition should satisfy

a1(1, 2) = a1(1, 2)

a2(1, 2) = +a2(1, 2)

(29)

so the dual space is cylindrical, as expected.

now turn to the case of (1, ) = (1, 1). looking at eq.(23) and taking determinant,

we can show that q should be even. and since p is prime to q, it is odd. the solution is

and under that

mf (s, k) = (1)kf (s, k).

mz1m1 = z t
1 ,
mz2m1 = z 
2 .

so on the dual noncommutative two torus we have the following conditions,

a1(1, 2) = a1(1 + , 2  2),

a2(1, 2) = +a2(1 + , 2  2).

so we have klein bottle.

6

(30)

(31)

(32)

last solution for (1, 1). again q is even, while p odd. the solution is

and

mf (s, k) = (1)kf (s, 1  k),

mz1m1 = z t
1 ,
mz2m1 = e2i a
q z 
2 .

(33)

(34)

so on the dual noncommutative two torus we have the following conditions,

a1(1, 2) = a1(1 + , 2q/a  2),

a2(1, 2) = +a2(1 + , 2q/a  2).

(35)

2 here
above boundary conditions give klein bottle as well. or the coecient in front of z 
may be thought to be irrelevant, because we can ignore it by redening z2. the convenient
fundamental region of the half-torus could be dierent, but the topology is intact.

4.2 klein bottle

now we consider orientifolding on a klein bottle.

mx1m1 = x t
mx2m1 = +x t

1 + 2r1,

2 + r2,

(36)

which are matrix theory realization of the following involution making klein bottle from
torus,

(1, 2)  (2  1,  + 2).

(37)

now we do the same as we did for the case of cylinder. the consistency consideration gives

u1u2 = e2iu2u1,
1 m = 1mu 1
u 
1 ,
u 
2 m = 2mu2,

mm = u2.

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

this time both 2,  can be absorbed into u2, so irrelevant. and consistency consideration
gives us 2
1 = e2i. a solution can be found only if q is odd, with 1 = (1)pei, 2 =  = 1.

mf (s, k) = (1)ke

ik

q f (s + 1/2, k),

(42)

7

this transforms the basis

mz1m1 = z t
1 ,
mz2m1 = z 
2 .

(43)

it is evident that we have klein bottle for the dual space. this is a rather surprising result,
since for u(1) theory on noncommutative torus, the orientifold projection apparently could
give cylindrical or klein bottle topology for the dual space [9]. but when we actually try to

nd the solution, we have only one case, which gives ym theory on klein bottle.

4.3 mobius strip

the involution we have to realize in terms of matrices is

the orientifold condition is

the consistency condition gives

(1, 2)  (2, 1).

mx1m1 =

mx2m1 =

r1
r2
r2
r1

x t
2 ,

x t
1 .

u1u2 = e2iu2u1,

u 

1 m = 1mu2,

u 

2 m = 2mu2,

mm = 1.

we can nd one solution which is fourier transformation operator on all the variables,

mf (s, k) = z dt

q

xl=1

e2istiklf (t, l)

with 1 = 2 =  = 1, which gives

mz1m1 = z 
2 ,
mz2m1 = z 
1 .

it is straightforward to check that the general should satisfy

a1(1, 2) = a2(2, 1),

a2(1, 2) = a2(2, 1),

which denes dual mobius strip through boundary condition.

5 twisted quantum bundle on t2

in this section we review the construction of twisted quantum u(q) bundle on noncommuta-

tive torus with constant abelian curvature. this is studied rst in [14] and generalized later
in [19]. quantum torus t2

 is dened in terms of two noncommuting coordinates, i.e.

[1, 2] = 2i.

using gauge invariance, any connection with constant curvature can be written as

with eld strength

d1 = 1 + if 2, d2 = 2 + if 1,

f  i[d1, d2] = 2(f + f 2).

(53)

(54)

the connections satisfy the periodic boundary condition up to unitary transition functions
i.

di(1 + 2, 2) = 1(2)di(1, 2)1
di(1, 2 + 2) = 2(1)di(1, 2)1

1 (2),
2 (1).

the solutions for i can be found easily,

where

1 = eip 2u,
2 = eip 1v,

p =

2f

1 + 2f

,

(55)

(56)

(57)

and u, v are q-dimensional t hooft matrices satisfying

uv = v u,

with  = e2ip/q. in this paper we choose uij = iij and vij = i,j+1. without loss of
generality we assume q, p are relatively prime.

due to the requirement of consistency the transition functions i must satisfy the cocycle

condition

1(2 + 2)2(1) = 2(1 + 2)1(2).

this imposes the following conditions

 = 1  q2,

p
q
q = 1 + 2f.

9

(58)

(59)

now we can nd the adjoint section of this quantum bundle, which satisfy (55)

z1 = eiq1/qv b,
z2 = eiq2/qu b,

(60)

where a, b are integers and satisfy aq  bp = 1. z1, z2 generate the algebra of sections on
the adjoint bundle. they satisfy

with

z1z2 = e2i

z2z1,

 =

a() + b
p() + q

.

(61)

the general solution of u(q) quantum bundle on noncommutative torus t2
as

 can be written

where

with

ai(1, 2) = xijz

cmnjmn(1, 2),

jmn(1, 2) = eimn

z m

1 (1)z n
= jmneiq(m1+n2)/q,

2 (2),

jmn = eimnb/qv bmu bn.

(62)

(63)

(64)

the duality of ym on noncommutative torus comes from the fact that jmn can be treated
as u(1) bundle on t2
 as well as u(q) bundle on t. note that jmn generate u(q). it
is obvious that  and  are related by sl(2,z). actually it is proved [8] that in general
the duality group is so(d, d) on d-dimensional noncommutative torus. to be correct what
 are morita equivalent when  and 
was shown is that two noncommutative tori td
belong to the same orbit of the group so(d, d|z), and equivalence of action functionals [7]
and bps spectrum of ym theories on morita equivalent tori are proved [14, 20, 23]. for two

 and td

dimensional case so(2,2)=sl(2,z)  sl(2,z), where one is the ordinary symmetry for two
dimensional torus, and the other is t-duality along the lightlike direction. in the following

two sections we will study the orientifolding of this quantum twisted bundle on cylinder and
klein bottle respectively.

6 twisted quantum bundle on cylinder

the twisted boundary condition should be

dt

dt

1 (1, 2) = md1(1, 2)m1,
2 (1, 2) = +md2(1, 2)m1,

(65)

10

we can introduce coordinate dependence into m, but it turns out it that does not give us
any genuine physical dierence. now m is a unitary matrix and acts only on the gauge

group part, and it is straightforward to check that the constant curvature connection (53)
satises above conditions with chosen sign convention, which is consistent with our previous
result (29).

here we must consider additional consistency conditions which is similar to the cocycle

condition. first we act the orientifold condition twice and get

m m =  1,

which means m is either symmetric or antisymmetric.

mingled with i, we also get

m 1(2)m1 = ei1 
m 1
2 (1)m1 = ei2 

1(2),

2(1),

(66)

(67)

where i are arbitrary phases. coordinate dependence is trivially satised, and the gauge
part is essentially the same with the solutions we found before for orientifolding of cds
projective module solution.

as symmetric one, we have

m =

1





1

1

.





  

1

then the adjoint section we found before transforms as

mz1(1, 2)m1 = z t
mz2(1, 2)m1 = z 1t

2

1 (1, 2),

(1, 2).

thus we nd the solution after orientifolding as

ai(1, 2) = xm,nz

cm,n(cid:16)jm,n + (1)ijm,n(cid:17) .

it is important to check what happens on the boundary of the cylinder, i.e. 2 = 0.

ai(1, 0) = xm,nz

cmn(cid:16)jm,n + (1)ijm,n(cid:17) eiqm1/q.

(68)

(69)

(70)

(71)

it is known that jm,n  jm,n generate so(q) [28]. a1 is in adjoint and a2 is in symmetric
tensor representation.

11

next two choices apply only when q is even. first we have

m =

1





1

  

1

1

.





then we have

mz1(1, 2)m1 = (1)bz t
mz2(1, 2)m1 = z 1t

2

(1, 2).

1 (1, 2),

(72)

(73)

since q is even, b is always odd, which is obvious from aq  bp = 1. thus we have the general

solution as following.

di(1, 2) = xm,nz

cm,n(cid:16)jm,n + (1)i(1)mjm,n(cid:17) .

on the boundary

di(1, 0) = xm,nz

cmn(cid:16)jm,n + (1)i(1)mjm,n(cid:17) eiqm1/q.

within our choice of u, v this subset corresponds to so(q) [28].

finally we have to try the case when m is antisymmetric,

m =





1

1

  

1

1

.





mum1 = e2ip/qu 1,

mv m1 = v 1.

since we have

we get

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

mz1(1, 2)m1 = (1)bz t
mz2(1, 2)m1 = e2ibp/qz 1t

2

1 (1, 2),

(1, 2).

(78)

and we again make use of the fact that b is odd, and bp = aq  1 to get the general solution

ai(1, 2) = xm,nz

cmn(cid:16)jmn + (1)i(1)me2in/qjm,n(cid:17) .

(79)

12

on the boundary

ai(1, 0) = xm,nz

cmn(cid:16)jmn + (1)i(1)me2in/qjm,n(cid:17) eiqm1/q.

(80)

and with our choice we have usp(q) on the boundary [28].

to sum up twisted u(q) bundle on cylinder can have so(q) or usp(q) on the boundary

according to the solutions.

7 twisted quantum bundle on klein bottle

we consider

dt

dt

1 (1 + , 2) = m(1, 2)d1(1, 2)m1(1, 2),
2 (1 + , 2) = +m(1, 2)d2(1, 2)m1(1, 2).

(81)

we have to consider the consistency condition. as the rst one we act m twice on di and
identify with 2. then we have

with

m(1, 2) = eip 2/2mkb,

m

kbmkb = u.

(82)

(83)

where u is the gauge part of 2. again successive transformations with i and m, we get

m 1(2)m1 = ei1 
2 (1)m1 = ei2 
m 1

1(2),

2(1 + ),

(84)

where i are arbitrary phases. when q is odd we can easily nd the solution to (83). it is
done as follows. u, v are related by unitary transformation, so assume kuk 1 = v , then
we can easily check mkb = k t v
2 k satises (83). it turns out that when q is even one
cant nd any solution, which is consistent with the fact that with the conventional choice
of u, v the determinant of u is 1 when q is even, while from the left hand side it should
be always positive. our choice in this paper is u = u t and v t = v 1 so the solution for
m is found to be

q+1

mkb =

,

(85)

q1

13

where  = 

q+1

2 . then we have

mkbum1
mkbv m1

kb = u 1,
kb = v 1.

(86)

and after some calculation the transformation for zi are simplied as

m(1, 2)z1(1, 2)m1(1, 2) = z t
m(1, 2)z2(1, 2)m1(1, 2) = z 1t

2

1 (1 + , 2),

(1 + , 2).

(87)

thus the general solution should be written as

ai(1, 2) = xm,nz

cmn(cid:16)jmn + (1)i(1)mjm,n(cid:17) .

(88)

8 discussions

in this paper we studied aspects of orientifolds matrix theory orientifolds on noncommutative

torus. it was important to note that matrix compactications can allow ambiguity in the
determination of dual space, but in fact concrete solution may not exist in some cases. for

example when compactied on klein bottle, u(1) theory on klein bottle can be related to
u(q) with odd q only. now it will be very interesting to study higher dimensional cases
following the procedure presented here, for example ale spaces c2/zn. we expect to be
able to interpolate the topology of dual space again, but when we actually nd out the

solution some might be excluded as was the case with lower dimensional examples studied
here. we also suggest the study of bps spectrum for matrix theory on s1  s1/z2 [31], with
noncommutativity, should be meaningfull and worth further research.
