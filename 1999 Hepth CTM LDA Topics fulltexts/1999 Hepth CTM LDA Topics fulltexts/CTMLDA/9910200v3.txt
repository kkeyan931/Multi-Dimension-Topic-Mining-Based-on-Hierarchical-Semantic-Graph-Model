abstract

we give a very simple proof that the renormalization of the chern-simons coupling
in the wilsonian eective action is exhausted at one-loop. our proof can apply to ar-

bitrary 2+1-dimensional abelian as well as nonabelian gauge theories without a bare
chern-simons coupling, including any non-renormalizable interactions and non-minimal
couplings. our proof reveals that small (but not large) gauge invariance is enough to

ensure the absence of higher order corrections.

1 introduction

various powerful tools have been developed recently in understanding the dynamics of
supersymmetric gauge theories (for a review, see [1]). holomorphy is one of such tools, and

seiberg [2] used it to greatly simplify the original proof of the non-renormalization theorem
[3] and succeeded to nd the exact vacuum structures of various supersymmetric models.
although holomorphy is inherent in supersymmetric theories, some of the techniques

developed in supersymmetric theories seem to be applied to non-supersymmetric ones.
nevertheless, very few are known about examples of such applications. the purpose of this

letter is to present an example that techniques developed in supersymmetric theories are
applied to non-supersymmetric ones to obtain (perturbative or non-perturbative) exact

results.

we consider a general (non-supersymmetric) gauge theory in 2+1-dimensions and give

a new simple proof that the renormalization of the chern-simons coupling is exhausted
at one-loop by using techniques developed in supersymmetric theories. our proof makes
it clear why the one-loop correction to the chern-simons coupling is so special. most of

our results have already been known but some of them are new.

gauge theories in 2 + 1-dimensions have a special feature to allow a chern-simons

term [4] (for a review, see [5])

z d3x lcs = z d3x  tr(cid:18)aa +

2
3

aaa(cid:19) .

(1)

this term can be generated in one-loop order of perturbation theory [4, 6, 7, 8] but the

two-loop correction is shown to vanish [9, 10]. for abelian theories, there are no further
corrections at higher loops [11, 12, 13]. it is widely believed that this is true even for
nonabelian theories, although no rigorous proof has been given. this expectation is based

on the topological nature of the chern-simons term. in nonabelian theories, this term
is not invariant under large gauge transformations, and consequently its coecient must

be quantized to obtain consistent quantum theories. if there were further corrections at
higher loops, they would necessarily spoil the quantized nature of the coupling. another

circumstantial evidence of the non-renormalization is that the -function of the chern-
simons coupling vanishes in all orders of perturbation theory [14, 15], although this does

not mean that there are no nite corrections to it.

the above topological reasoning to the non-renormalization of the chern-simons cou-
pling is, however, somewhat mysterious because in perturbation theory we would not a

priori expect to know anything about non-perturbative large gauge transformations
and because the argument cannot apply to abelian theories. our proof given in the next

section can apply to both abelian and nonabelian theories and relies only on gauge in-
variance under small gauge transformations. furthermore, our proof can apply to a wider

1

class of gauge theories than those discussed by coleman and hill [12]. the authors proved
the non-renormalization theorem of the chern-simons coupling in a class of minimally
coupled gauge theories, in which gauge interactions are introduced by replacing spacetime

derivatives by covariant ones, though their proof can allow non-renormalizable interac-
tions. gauge theories we consider are more general and are not restricted to minimally

coupled ones.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, some background of recent devel-

opments in supersymmetric theories is explained and then a very simple proof of the
non-renormalization theorem is given. in section 3, several remarks are made.

2 a proof

we consider a general 2 + 1-dimensional gauge theory involving scalar elds i, spinor
elds a and the gauge eld a. the general gauge-invariant action we start with is of
the form

s = z d3x(

1
4g2 trff  

i (cid:16)dd + m2

i(cid:17) i +a (id/  ma) a +g(a, , )) , (2)

where g is a general gauge-invariant function of a, i and a.3 we here assume that
there is no bare chern-simons coupling. a generalization to the theory with a non-

vanishing bare chern-simons coupling will be discussed in the next section.

it should be emphasized that we take the normalization that the gauge coupling g does
not appear in the covariant derivative d, i.e. d    ia. it is known that in super-
symmetric gauge theories this normalization of the gauge coupling preserves holomorphy
and is crucial to prove the one-loop exactness of the gauge coupling renormalization [16],

as stressed in ref.[17]. this normalization of the gauge coupling turns out to be crucial
also in our proof of the one-loop exactness of the chern-simons coupling renormalization,

as we will see below.

we shall give a proof of the non-renormalization theorem of the chern-simons cou-

pling in terms of the wilsonian eective action (for a review, see [18]), which is identical to
the 1pi eective action when there are no interacting massless particles. in supersymmet-

ric theories, it is crucial to distinguish two eective actions, as pointed out by shifman
and vainshtein [16]. when interacting massless particles are present, the 1pi eective
action suers from infrared ambiguities and might suer from holomorphic anomalies,

which would lead to the violation of non-renormalization theorems [19, 20, 21, 22]. these
are absent in the wilsonian eective action. interestingly, a similar situation happens in

our problem. it has been reported, in refs.[14, 23, 24, 25], that non-vanishing radiative

3 we assume that g contains no quadratic terms in the elds.

2

corrections to the chern-simons coupling will appear in higher loops when massless par-
ticles are present. these higher order corrections are caused by infrared singularities. to
avoid such infrared problems, it should be understood that our proof is applied to the

chern-simons coupling dened in the wilsonian eective action. another advantage of
the use of the wilsonian eective action is that non-renormalizable terms in the action

(2) can be managed because high-momentum modes beyond a cuto are not included in
the functional integration. the momentum cuto, however, gets into trouble with gauge

invariance [26]. this subject is beyond the scope of this letter and we assume that the
cuto respects gauge invariance in the wilsonian eective action.

our proof of the non-renormalization of the chern-simons term is an application of the
works by dine [27] and weinberg [28], in which a simple proof of the non-renormalization
[29] of the fayet-iliopoulos u(1)d-term [30] has been given in general supersymmetric

gauge theories. the key technical tool used in their proof is the seiberg trick [2] of
regarding coupling parameters as the scalar components of external superelds. following

the approach by dine and weinberg, we regard all the couplings in the action (2) as the
external scalar elds.4 suppose that the chern-simons term (1) is generated in the
wilsonian eective action. then, the induced chern-simons coupling  would depend on
the gauge coupling and other couplings appearing as coecients of interaction terms in g.

however, if we regard the couplings as the scalar elds, the expression (1) is not gauge-
invariant even under small gauge transformations unless  is a constant, i.e. independent
of all coupling parameters. the graphs independent of all couplings are just the one-loop

ones generated from the action without g in eq.(2).

3 remarks

we have presented a very simple (rather trivial) proof of the non-renormalization theorem
of the chern-simons coupling in 2 + 1-dimensional gauge theories without a bare chern-

simons coupling. most of the results given in this letter have already been known but
some of them are new: for abelian theories, our proof can apply to a wider class of gauge-
invariant theories than those considered by coleman-hill [12], in which gauge interactions

have been restricted to the minimal coupling. for nonabelian theories, our results are
new and our proof has revealed that only small gauge invariance is enough to ensure the

absence of higher order corrections. we do not need to require large gauge invariance at
all.

we have started with general gauge theories without a bare chern-simons coupling.

4 precisely speaking, we regard the gauge coupling and all coecients of interaction terms in g as the

external scalar elds. the mass parameters remain to be constants.

3

when a bare chern-simons term is present, our proof could not apply to this case. this is
because the chern-simons term (1) would not be gauge-invariant if the bare chern-simons
coupling is regarded as a scalar eld. for abelian theories, this problem can be remedied

by still keeping it a constant and by absorbing it into the gauge eld propagator. this
does not, however, work for nonabelian theories because the nonabelian chern-simons

term includes an interaction term. although we do not know whether our proof can be
generalized to this case, it may not be unreasonable to expect that a similar proof could

work for yang-mills-chern-simons gauge theories because no higher order corrections to
the chern-simons coupling have been proved for pure nonabelian chern-simons gauge

theories [31, 32, 33].

as mentioned in section 2, it is crucial, in our proof, to take the convention that the
gauge coupling does not appear in the covariant derivative. one might expect that the

proof given in the previous section could hold in other conventions of the gauge coupling,
for example, the canonical normalization, in which a in eq.(2) may be replaced by ga.
this is not, however, the case because in the canonical normalization the gauge kinetic
term would break gauge invariance if we think of the gauge coupling as a scalar eld.
furthermore, the rescaling of the eld, a  ga, will cause another problem that the
functional measure may not be invariant under the rescaling and a chern-simons term

could be generated from the integration measure [17]. it would be of interest to clarify
the relation between dierent conventions of the gauge coupling.

it may be instructive to make a comment that our proof tells us that the chern-

simons term (1) can be generated at most at one-loop but does not forbid the appearance
of would be chern-simons terms in the eective action [34, 35, 36]. for example, a
term fd, which is manifestly gauge-invariant and may be generated at higher
loops, may reduce to a chern-simons term after replacing  by its expectation value

<  > in the higgs phase.

the nal remark is as follows: in the previous section, we have insisted that the in-
duced chern-simons coupling must be independent of all coupling parameters. this will

be true even non-perturbatively as long as gauge symmetry is preserved in the wilsonian
eective action. we have then concluded, from this fact, that the radiative corrections

to the chern-simons coupling come from only the one-loop diagrams generated from the
action with g = 0 in eq.(2). this conclusion is true as long as the couplings are treated

perturbatively but is this true even non-perturbatively? at the moment, we have no def-
inite answer to this question. this is because the requirement of gauge invariance would

not forbid the induced chern-simons coupling, for example, to be a function of /|| for
some coupling parameter , since /|| looks like a constant as long as  is restricted
to be positive (or negative). in fact, such dependence is known to appear at one-loop for

4

 = the fermion masses and the bare chern-simons coupling. since the mass parameters
are incorporated into the propagators and are not treated perturbatively, this may sug-
gest that a locally-constant function of the couplings, which does not contradict gauge

invariance, could appear non-perturbatively. it would be of great interest to generalize
the perturbative non-renormalization theorem to non-perturbative one.
