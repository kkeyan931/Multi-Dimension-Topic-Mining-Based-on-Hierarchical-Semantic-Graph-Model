abstract

we review the method of constructing dipole and string loop solutions from
the higher-dimensional (euclidean) kerr black hole. we analyse the results
in various dimensions, nding solutions earlier given in the literature. then
we construct a new heterotic dipole with non-trivial dilaton and gauge elds.
this can, in turn, be describes as a brane/anti-brane pair which interpolates
between the kk-dipole and the h-dipole. finally an argument is presented
on the tachyonic instability by analysing the string uctuations on the dipole
background.

1. introduction

brane/anti-brane pairs have recently played very important role in our
understanding of stable non-bps states in string theory [1]. as a classical
vacuum, brane/anti-brane pair leads to unstable conguration. first of all,
they attract each other as they are oppositely charged. moreover, when the
separation between them is of the order of the string length, there appears
tachyon in the conguration [2]. however, it has been argued in the recent
past that, in certain cases, this tachyon leads the system to a stable xed
point in the renormalisation group sense [3].

since the classical force between brane/anti-brane system never vanishes,
search for a conguration describing the pair as a classical solution looses its
meaning. however, if we introduce a non-zero background electromagnetic
eld which triggers repulsion between brane and the anti-brane in such a
way that it cancels the attractive force between them, then one would expect
to nd a classical conguration describing the pair in equilibrium3. in [4],
such a solution was constructed in string theory and various instabilities
were analysed. it has been argued that the kaluza-klein (kk) dipole of 5-
dimensional gravity [5] has the property of describing brane/anti-brane pair
when we add required at directions4. an asymptotic magnetic eld appears
naturally which, in turn, keeps the system in equilibrium. to our knowledge,
this is the only classical conguration known for the brane/anti-brane system
till now.

before we go into the detail of our analysis of brane/anti-brane pair let
us rst summarise what we do in this letter. in section 2.1, we review, in
brief, the d = 5 dipole following [4]. this dipole is constructed by starting
with euclidean kerr metric and adding a time direction. the dipole con-
guration is made out of monopole, anti-monopole pair. while lifted up in
eleven dimensions, it describes a dirichlet six and anti-six brane pair upon
dimensional reduction over the taub-nut direction. in section 2.2, we ana-
lyse the situation in higher dimentions 5. following [8] closely , we argue that
similar construction in d = 6 gives an oriented string loop. the opposite

3it may not be a stable equilibrium though. instabilities due to the tachyon is expected

to be absent if the distance between the pair is large enough.

4on the other hand, some of the dipole like solutions with magnetic ux tubes have
directly been constructed in [6, 7]. however, most of them do not have kk interpretation.
5 this corrects a crucial interpretational error that was made in an earlier version of

this paper.

points on the loop behaves as monopole or anti-monopole if we look close
enough. we discuss this in a very explicit manner. we further use these
results in section 2.3 to excite gauge eld along the world-sheet direction of
the string loop. noticing the importance of brane/anti-brane congurations
in understanding the physics of non-bps states, in section 3, we construct
a very general ve-dimensional dipole which can be embedded in heterotic
string theory. this solution is characterized by an angular parameter. this
parameter allows the solution to interpolate between the usual kk dipole
and the h-dipole. we also, as before, analyse the system critically to isolate
each of the constituents of the dipole system.
in the last section, we try
to understand if these brane/anti-brane congurations (in the presence of
background electromagnetic eld) can be realised as stable string or super-
string background at least when the distance between constituents is large.
unfortunately, we nd that they likely lead to unstable string backgrounds.
a string or superstring propagating in these background contains tachyon in
their spectrum.

2. dipoles and loops

we start with the (d  1)-dimensional kerr metric [9]:

ds2

(d1) = 

r2 + a2cos2  2mr6d

r2 + a2cos2

d 2 

4mr6dasin2
r2 + a2cos2

d d

(1)

sin2

+

r2 + a2cos2h(r2 + a2)(r2 + a2cos2) + 2mr6da2sin2i d2
r2 + a2  2mr6d + d2i + r2cos2 dd5.

+ (r2 + a2cos2)h

dr2

note that this metric has horizon(s) when

r2 + a2  2mr6d = 0.

(2)

for d  6, there is a critical value of a beyond which the horizon does not
exists. however, in case of d > 6, for any a and m, there exists one horizon.

we then perform an euclidean rotation

  ix,

a  ia,

3

(3)

and add a new time direction t. the solution thus obtained has the following
form:

ds2 = dt2 + (r2  a2cos2)(

dr2


+ d2) +  sin2 h d2

+h1 (dx  ad)2 + r2cos2 dd5,

where the gauge eld a and the functions h are given by:
2mr6da sin2

r2  a2 cos2 
 + a2 sin2 

,

h =

a =

 + a2sin2

,

and

 = r2  a2  2mr6d,

(4)

(5)

(6)

since the solutions (1) and (4) are time independent, the above construc-
tion is guaranteed to give a solution of the einstein equations and can be
embedded in any theory containing gravity.

2.1. brane/anti-brane pair

in d = 5, (4) corresponds to monopole/anti-monopole pair as has been
discussed in [4]. this can be seen explicitly by looking at the metric on
 = 0. at  = 0, and  = 0, the above metric reduces to an anti-monopole
conguration, and, on the other hand, at  = 0 and  = , we get a monopole
conguration. notice that, in order to avoid singularities, the coordinates
appearing in (4) have to lie within certain period. for d = 5, they are given
by

m + m 2 + a2  r  , ,

4m(m + m 2 + a2)

m 2 + a2

0  x 
ax

,

(7)

0   

2m(m + m 2 + a2)  2.

the non-trivial periodicity of  shows, in fact, the existence of an external
magnetic eld, causing a repulsive magnetic force which cancels the attractive
electric and gravitational forces and keeps the monopole and anti-monopole
in equilibrium [4]. the distance between the pair can be calculated easily by
integrating the metric along . for large a, the distance turns out to be 2a.
this associates a physical meaning to the parameter a.

4

the above conguration can be lifted up to d = 10 or d = 11 in a straight
forward way by adding extra at directions. upon dimensional reduction over
x, the eleven dimensional metric reduces to a dirichlet six/anti-six brane pair
in type iia string theory. since under t -duality along x, the constituent
monopole goes to an h-monopole, we expect for d = 5, the t -dual metric
that follows from (4) will describe an h-dipole.

2.2. oriented string loop6

one might wonder as to what happens if we generalize the dipole con-
guration of the sub-section 2.1 for higher dimensions without just adding
at directions. in other words, analysing eqn. (4) for d  5 in the same
line as above. in that case, one gets a loop of kk-brane [8] rather than a
monopole/anti-monopole. in this sub-section, we discuss the conguration
in some detail for d = 6. we will see that indeed for d = 6, eqn. (4) is
nothing but a kk-string loop lying along the transverse direction d.
in
the last sub-section, we will use this result to excite gauge elds along the
world-sheet direction of the loop.

as mentioned above, we start with eqn. (4) for d = 6. the metric in six

dimensions takes the form:

ds2 = dt2 + (r2  a2cos2)(

+ d2) +  sin2 h d2

dr2


+h1 (dx  ad)2 + r2cos2 d2.

where

 = r2  a2  2m ,

a =

2masin2
 + a2sin2

.

to avoid the conical singularity at r = a2 + 2m, one must have

0  x 

4m

a2 + 2m

,

0   

ax
2m  2 .

(8)

(9)

(10)

notice that in the limit of large a, the radius in the x direction depends on
the ratio m
a . this is unlike the dipoles in d = 5, where the radius along x at
large a is independent of a [4]. due to this twisted boundary condition (10)

6we thank r. emparan for pointing out a misinterpretation of this result in the previous

version of this paper.

5

on , there is an asymptotic magnetic eld [8]. if we use  =  ax/2m as
independent coordinate, the magnetic eld is given by b = a/2m. 7
to have further insights of the conguration, we will now analyse the
metric at  = 0,  when  vanishes. from the structure it is clear that
the zero of  occurs at r = r0 = a2 + 2m. to analyse the metric near
r = r0,  = 0, we dene coordinates8

a2 + 2m sin2 =  (1  cos),
2(r  r0) =  (1 + cos),

(11)

(12)

and look at the limit

a  ,

  0,

r  r0

m  0,

(13)
with a sin2 xed and rr0 nite. in this limit, the metric takes the following
form
ds2 = dt2 + d 2 + h 1(cid:16)dx  ad(cid:17)2

+h(cid:16)d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2(cid:17) (14)

with

h = 1 +

m


a = m(1  cos )

m =

m

a2 + 2m

(15)

in (14),  = a2 + 2m with period 0    2a2 + 2m . thus we

see that near r = r0,  = 0, there is a six-dimensional kk anti-monopole
structure, a string-like object with world-sheet coordinates (t, ). similarly,
one can analyse at r = r0,  = . this gives a metric of a monopole
conguration which has the same metric as (14) with a change of sign in the
gauge eld.

however, we must notice that the -direction is an isometry direction
with period 2r0. hence the limit (13) is true for every value of  and what
we are seeing is actually an oriented string loop along  (see figure 1). the
(anti)-monopole structure (14) in the limit (13) is just a limit artifact, the
dierent signs of the gauge elds at  = 0 and  =  is due to the opposite
orientation of the loop.

7a dierent choice of coordinate will however change the magnetic eld, see [8].
8this coordinate system turns out to be the analogous one that was used in [4] for the

ve-dimensional dipole.

2.3. exciting gauge eld on the loop

in general, a d-dimensional kerr black hole is characterized by [ d1
2 ]
angular momentum parameters [9], where the square brackets indicate the
integer part. in order to obtain a string loop conguration with more then
one non-trivial gauge eld, we need to start with the general d-dimensional
kerr metric. we illustrate this by starting with the kerr metric in ve
dimensions with two non-zero angular momenta proportional to a1 and a2
[9]. we then follow the same procedure as described in (3). the resulting
metric has the form:

ds2 = dt2 + (r2  a2

(17)

the general analysis of this metric is very complicated and it is not clear
what the interpretation of the above solution is. we will restrict ourselves
to the case a1  a2. in this case, the metric structure simplies and can be
analysed in a straight forward manner. however, in doing so, we will miss
out important physics which appear at order o(a2) or higher.

in the limit a1  a2, (16) reduces to the following simple form:

ds2 = dt2 + (r2  a2

a =

1  2m and

2ma2cos2
1sin2
 + a2

,

a =

2ma1sin2
 + a2
2cos2

.

in the limit (13), the metric reduces to

ds2 = dt2 + d 2 + h(d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2)

(19)

(20)

2a2 m (1  cos) d d + h 1(dx  ad  a d )2

with the expression for the gauge elds given by:

a = m(1  cos),

a  =

m a2


.

(21)

here the parameters r0, m have the same form as before with a replaced
by a1 and a2 = a2/qa2
1 + 2m . comparing with (14) and (15), we see that

8

the above metric describes a string loop with gauge eld a excited on the
world-sheet direction .

in exactly similar manner, we can study the limit a2  a1. in this case,
the poles change the position, now located at  = /2 and , 3/2 and the
gauge elds interchange their roles.

3. heterotic dipole

a more general dipole solution can be found, starting from the general
rotating charged black hole solution of d = 4 heterotic string theory. such
a solution with one u(1) gauge eld v (all other u(1) vectors, moduli and
vectors coming from compactication set equal to zero) was given in [10].
the metric is characterized by three parameters, namely m, a and , where
 parametrizes an o(1, 1) t -duality rotation between the kerr-solution and
the heterotic charged rotating black hole. after an euclidean rotation

  ix,

a  ia,

  i,

(22)

and adding a new time direction t, we get the following solution of d = 5
heterotic string theory (in the string frame, following the notation of [11]):

ds2 = dt2 + (r2  a2cos2)(

note that for  = 0 we recover the ve-dimensional dipole (4), and for  = ,
the solution takes the form of a s0/antis0-brane (h-dipole) which is t -
dual to (4). the dipole nature of the interpolating solution can be easily
seen from the asymptotic behaviour of the vector elds a()
x. the
total dipole moment of the solution is 2ma, to which the above gauge elds
contribute with a factor cos2 
2 respectively . furthermore, to
avoid singularities associated with the above metric, one must have

(25)

note that for  = 0 we nd the periodicity of the previous case (7), but
howeverwe do not understand the limit   , where the period of x goes to
zero. as before, due to the non-trivial periodicity of , we see an appearance
of background magnetic eld. in the near pole limit (13), the solution (23)
is of the form

the geodesic distance among the constituents of the dipole can be calcu-
lated from the metric by integrating along . for large a, the distance turns
out to be 2a in the string-frame.

4. tachyonic instability

all the solutions that are discused in (4) can be embedded obviously in
any string or superstring theories since they are the solutions of einstein gra-
vity. as a consequence, they can be considered as various string backgrounds.
a natural question thus is to ask if these backgrounds are stable. first thing
in this direction will be to check if string/superstring propagating in these
backgrounds contain tachyons in their uctuation spectrum. the aim of this
section is to carry out an analysis of this issue. in general, string uctuations
in a non-trivial background is hard to analyse. this is because one needs
to have a description of the background in terms of world-sheet conformal
eld theory (cft). the dipole backgrounds that we have discussed earlier
have very complicated eld congurations. however, at very large radial
distance the the structure simplies. fortunately for us, in this regime, the
two dimensional cft is known and has been analysed in the literature [12].
we will thus make use of his results.

as an illustrative example, we will work with the solution (4) for d = 5.

the solution can be read o from (4). various parameters are
r0 = m + m 2 + a2.

 = r2  2mr  a2,

(28)

here as before r0 corresponds to the zero of . for our present purpose, we
will also need the periods of x and . their ranges are

4m(m + m 2 + a2)

m 2 + a2

0  x 

,

0   

2a

m 2 + a2

.

(29)

in order to proceed, we rst notice that for r  , the metric reduces to

ds2 = dt2 + d2 + dz2 + 2d2 + dx 2.

(30)

here we have dened  = rsin, z = rcos. thus the metric is at. however,
due to nontrivial periods of various coordinates (29), there is an asymptotic
magnetic eld b given by

b =

a

2m(m + m 2 + a2)

.

(31)

upon reduction over x, we would thus get four dimensional melvin solution
(see [13] for detail).

11

fortunately, melvin background is one of the very few backgrounds where
string world-sheet has a description in terms of cft [12]9. if we denote the
1
radius of x by r (which follows from (29)), then for integer
br , one has
an orbifold cft. the non-trivial part of the cft is a zn orbifold of 2-
dimensional plane times a circle, where n is related to the magnetic eld
of the melvin solution. however, it is known that this cft description for
string or superstring, contains tachyon in the spectrum and the mass formula
is given by m2 = 4 + 4
n [14]. from this observation, we thus conclude
that the dipole solution for d = 5 at large radial distance leeds to unstable
string or superstring background due to the presence of tachyon.
