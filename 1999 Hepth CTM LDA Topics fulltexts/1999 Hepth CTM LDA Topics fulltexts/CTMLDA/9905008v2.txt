this paper was originally designated as comment to the paper by r. jackiw and v. alan
kostelecky1. we provide an example of the fermionic system, the superuid 3he-a, in which the
cp t -odd chern-simons terms in the eective action are unambiguously induced by chiral fermions.
in this system the lorentz and gauge invariances both are violated at high energy, but the behavior
of the system beyond the cut-o is known. this allows us to construct the cp t - odd action, which
combines the conventional 3+1 chern-simons term and the mixed axial-gravitational chern-simons
term discussed in ref.2. the inuence of chern-simons term on the dynamics of the eective gauge
eld has been experimentally observed in rotating 3he-a.

recently the problem of the radiatively induced cp t -
odd chern- simons term in 3+1 quantum eld theory has
been addressed in a number of papers3,1,47. the chern-
simons (cs) term lcs = 1
2 kefa in the 3+1
electromagnetic action, where k is a constant 4-vector,
is induced by the cp t - and lorentz- violating axial-
vector term b5 in the dirac lagrangian for massive
fermions. in the limit of small and large b compared with
mass m of dirac fermions, it was found that

k =

k =

however it has been concluded that the existence of cs
term depends on the choice of regularization procedure
 a renormalization ambiguity. this means that the
result for k depends on physics beyond the cut-o.

the above cp t -odd term can result not only from
the violation of the cp t symmetry in the vacuum. the
nonzero density of the chiral fermions violates the cp t
invariance and thus can also lead to the chern-simons
term, with b0 determined by the chemical potential 
and temperature t of the fermionic system810.

here we provide an example of the fermionic system,
in which such chern-simons term is unambiguously in-
duced by fermions. in this system the lorentz and gauge
invariances both are violated at high energy, but the be-
havior of the system beyond the cut-o is known. this
allows the calculation of cs term in dierent physical
situations. the inuence of this cs term on the dynam-
ics of the eective gauge eld has been experimentally
observed.

this is the superuid 3he-a, where in the low-energy
corner there are two species of fermionic quasiparticles:
left-handed and right-handed weyl fermions11. quasi-
particles interact with the order parameter, the unit l-
vector of the orbital momentum of cooper pairs, in the
same manner as chiral relativistic fermions interact with

1

the vector potential of the u (1) gauge eld: a  pfl,
where pf is the fermi momentum. the electric charges
 the charges of the left and right quasiparticles with re-
spect to this eective gauge eld  are er = el = 1.
the normal component of superuid 3he-a consists of
the thermal fermions, whose density is determined by t
and by the velocity vn  vs of the ow of the normal
component with respect to the superuid vacuum. the
velocity of the counterow in the direction of l is equiva-
lent to the chemical potentials for left and right fermions
in relativistic system:

r = l = pfl  (vn  vs) .

(3)

as in the relativistic theories, the state of the system
of chiral quasiparticles with nonzero counterow velocity
(an analogue of chemical potential) violates lorentz in-
variance and cp t symmetry and induces the cp t - odd
chern-simons term. this term can be written in gen-
eral form, which is valid both for the relativistic systems
including that found in ref.8,9 and for 3he-a11:

here sums over l and r mean summation over all the
left-handed and right-handed fermionic species respec-
tively; el and er are charges of left and right fermions
with respect to u (1) eld (say, hypercharge eld in the
standard model).

translation of eq.(4) to the 3he-a language gives

p3
f

22 (cid:16)l0  (vs  vn)(cid:17)(cid:16)l  (~  l)(cid:17) .

(5)

here l0 is the direction of the order parameter l in the
homogeneous ground state; vn  vs is the uniform coun-
terow of the fermionic quasiparticles with respect to the
superuid vacuum; and l = l l0 is the deviation of the
order parameter from its ground state direction.

since for chiral fermions the chemical potential plays
the part of the parameter b0 in the fermionic lagrangian,
the connection between k0 and b0 is k0 = b0/22 in 3he-
a. though it agrees with the result obtained in rela-
tivistic system with nonzero chemical potential for chiral
fermions8, it does not coincide with eq.(2) obtained in
the massless limit m/b0  0.

the instability of the electromagnetic vacuum due to
the 3+1 chern- simons term has been discussed by car-
oll, field and jackiw12, andrianov and soldati13, and
joyce and shaposhnikov10.
in the case of the nonzero
density of right electrons (r 6= 0) this instability leads
to the conversion of the density of the right electrons to
the hypermagnetic eld. this eect was used in the sce-
nario for nucleation of the primordial magnetic eld10. in
3he-a this phenomenon is represented by the well known
helical instability of the counterow, which is triggered
by the term in eq.(5)14. the conversion of the coun-
terow of the normal component (an analogue of r in
the joyce-shaposhnikov scenario) to the inhomogeneous
l-eld with   l 6= 0 (an analogue of hypermagnetic
eld) due to this instability has been observed in rotat-
ing 3he-a15,11.

recently another type of the chern-simons term has
been found for both systems, 3he-a and chiral rela-
tivistic fermions with nonzero  or/and t . this is the
mixed axial-gravitational cs term, which contains both
the gauge eld and the gravimagnetic eld2:

bg = ~  g , g  g0i .

here g0i is the element of the metric in the reference
frame of the heat bath (in superuids it is the element
of the eective metric in the frame, in which the normal
component is at rest). if the heat bath of chiral fermions
is rotating in minkowski space, the gravimagnetic eld
is expressed in terms of rotation velocity :

bg =   g = 2


c2 .

(7)

here c is the material parameter, which is the speed of
light in relativistic system, and the initial slope in the
energy spectrum of fermionic quasiparticles propagating
in the plane transverse to the l-vector in 3he-a11. the
material parameters do not enter eq.(6) explicitly: they
enter only through the metric. that is why the same
equation eq.(6) can be applied to dierent fermionic sys-
tems, including those with varying speed of light. in rel-
ativistic system this equation describes the macroscopic
parity violating eect: rotation of the heat bath (or of
the black hole) produces the ux of the chiral fermions
along the rotation axis16.

comparison of the eqs.(6) and (4) suggests that the
two cp t -odd terms can be united if one uses the larmor
theorem and introduces the combined elds:

al(r) = el(r)a +

1
2

l(r)g , bl(r) =   al(r) . (8)

then the general form of the chern-simons cp t -odd
term is

note that in the standard model the nullication of
the cp t -odd term in eq.(9) occurs if the gyromag-
netic ratio e/ is the same for all fermions. this hap-
pens because of the anomaly cancellation. for the cp t -
odd term induced by the vacuum fermions, the anomaly
cancellation was discussed in refs.7,3. in 3he-a the gy-
romagnetic ratio is the same for two fermionic species,
el/l = er/r, but the cs terms survive, since there
is no anomaly cancellation in this system.

in 3he-a there are also subtle points related to gauge
invariance of the cs term, as discussed by coleman and
glashow17, and to the reference frame. they are deter-
mined by physical situations.

(i) the reference frame for superuid velocity vs is the
heat bath frame  the frame of the normal component
moving with velocity vn. at t = 0 this frame disappears:
thermal fermions are frozen out. to avoid uncertainty in
determination of the counterow velocity vs  vn, and
thus of the chemical potential of the chiral fermions, the
limit t  0 must be taken after all other limits.

(ii) the leading terms in the low-energy eective action
for the electrodynamics of 3he-a are gauge invariant,
because the main contributions to the eective action
are induced by the low-energy fermions, which are rela-
tivistic and obey the gauge invariant lagrangian. the
eq.(9) is an example of such gauge invariant term in the
low-energy action. it is gauge invariant if the b0 param-
eter (or r) is constant, i.e. if the background counter-
ow and l0 eld are homogeneous. the inhomogeneous
corrections, which correspond to the inhomogeneous b0,
violate the gauge invariance. this is natural, since these
corrections are determined by the higher energy fermions,
which do not obey the gauge invariance from the very be-
ginning. this is in agreement with the conclusion made
in ref.1, that for existence of the cs term the weak con-
dition  the gauge invariance at zero 4-momentum  is
required.
