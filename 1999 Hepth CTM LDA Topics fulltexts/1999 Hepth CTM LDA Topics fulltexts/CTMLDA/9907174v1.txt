abstract

we discuss a formalism for solving (2 + 1) ads gravity on riemann surfaces. in the
torus case the equations of motion are solved by two functions f and g, solutions of
two independent o(2, 1) sigma models, which are distinct because their rst integrals
contain a dierent time dependent phase factor. we then show that with the gauge
choice k = /tg(2t) the same couple of rst integrals indeed solves exactly the
einstein equations for every riemann surface. the x a = x a(x) polydromic map-
ping which extends the standard immersion of a constant curvature three-dimensional
surface in a at four-dimensional space to the case of external point sources or topol-
ogy, is calculable with a simple algebraic formula in terms only of the two sigma model
solutions f and g. a trivial time translation of this formalism allows us to introduce
a new method which is suitable to study the scattering of black holes in (2 + 1) ads
gravity.

1 introduction

in this article we extend a previous study of (2 + 1) gravity on riemann surface to the case
of cosmological constant [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7]. the absence of gravitational radiation intro-
duces an important simplication to the dynamics since it allows to choose an instantaneous
gauge for the propagation of the gravitational eld, and we can forget the problem of the
delay due to the speed limitation of signals.

the classical gravitational dynamics reduces to a renormalization of the matter sources,
and in particular the two-body interacting problem can be solved as the two particles move
following the geodesics around an eective source, whose invariant mass is computable with
the wilson loop of the spin connection around the two particles [7].

the case of the cosmological constant addition is useful not only at a classical level, where
it sheds light on black-hole scattering, but also at a quantum level because it teaches us how
to quantize the gravitational eld when it doesnt carry bulk degrees of freedom [4]. it seems
that although non-renormalizable 2 + 1 gravity can be understood at the quantum level by
virtue of its integrability, of being a topological theory, whose dynamics is to introduce a
braiding of a two-dimensional boundary theory, which can be related to a conformal eld
theory or some integrable deformation of it.

at a quantum level we expect that the gravitational degrees of freedom have lower di-
mension and live on the boundary of the bulk. several articles have recently emphasized the
importance of the holography in eld theory, as the property that allows to reconstruct the
eld in the bulk starting from the knowledge of the eld at the boundary. in 2 + 1 gravity
the holography property seems particularly easy to show.

our main aim will be investigate how to reduce classical ads gravity to a two dimensional
eld theory. let us remember rapidly the main results obtained in this direction. at a
classical level particle dynamics has already been solved in the gauge k = 0 [8] since this gauge
makes possible to reduce the interacting problem to a choice of conformal mappings, dened
by the monodromy conditions, related to the particles constant of motion. exact results
have been found in the two-body case [8], and an interesting connection with painleve vi
for the three body case [8, 10]. furthermore in order to treat topological degrees of freedom
we followed moncrief choice of a time slicing ( k constant but not zero )[11]. the resulting
equations of motions can be simplied by choosing a conformal gauge for the spatial metric.
it has been recognized that the eld dynamics for riemann surfaces can be reduced to a
sine-gordon theory, at least for the conformal factor of the spatial metric, and a rst-order
formalism based on a rst-integral of a o(2, 1) sigma model can be built.
in this rst-
order formalism we have built out of the solution f of the o(2, 1) sigma model a coordinate

1

transformation x a = x a(x) from a minkowskian coordinate system to the physical one.
each spatial slice is equivalent to a riemann surface, which we represent with branch cuts
on the complex plane. the corresponding metric is singular at the branch points, which
move as particle singularities. the motion of the branch points in the x a coordinates is
free and determined by the poincare holonomies, dening the coupling of riemann surface
to gravity. by solving the mapping f , we can nd the dynamics of the branch points and of
the moduli of the riemann surface in the physical coordinate system [12].

at a level of the cosmological constant we are going to show that it is possible to avoid
further complications, and the rst-order formalism can be easily generalized to a couple
of rst-integrals of two o(2, 1) sigma-models, distinct only by a phase factor in the source.
as a rst consequence we can generalize the classical mathematical theorem regarding the
immersion of a riemann surface with genus g > 1 in the poincare disk to the immersion of
ads gravity on riemann surfaces into the direct product of two poincare disks. then the
mathematical formalism which has been successfully applied to the (2 + 1)-gravity case can
be generalized without problem to the ads case.

a simple time translation of the gauge choice produces the gauge condition suited to
study the scattering of two particles and, a case more interesting, the scattering of black
holes. as an outcome of our work we give at disposition an useful reference-point for the
study of this non-perturbative classical problem of general relativity, apart from the fact
that conformal gauge choice, which is peculiar to all our work, can be done only in the (
connected ) region outside the horizons.

these are, from our point of view, the more appropriate gauge choices in which to look
for a solution for the riemann surfaces coupled to ads gravity and the black hole scattering.
while for the former ones we give the explicit solution in some cases, for the second problem
we postpone to a future work the detailed study.

at a classical level, for example the torus, we recover that its modulus describes a circular
motion in teichmuller space, while for certain riemann surfaces dened by the condition
f = g the solutions to the two sigma models become analytic and the moduli of the riemann
surfaces are static, i.e. they do not have any temporal dependence. only with a non-analytic
solution of the two o(2, 1) sigma models it is possible to introduce a non trivial dynamics.

at a quantum level since all these theories have a nite number of degrees of freedom
we expect a reduction of quantum eld theory to a problem of quantum mechanics. for
example we can quantize the lagrangian of the modulus of the torus, introducing a canonical
momentum to  , and writing down a schrodinger equation acting on the hilbert space of
square integrable functions of  [12]. this reduced quantization is analogous to the particle

2

case [4], where one can integrate out the eld into an eective action for the particle degrees
of freedom. this reduced quantization is an useful short-cut of the full second-quantized
problem, i.e. in which one ask himself how to treat topology-changing amplitudes or creation
and annihilation processes for particles [1].

maybe a new treatment of three dimensional gravity resembling two dimensional quantum
eld theory can handle these problems. in this sense the idea of t hooft of quantizing gravity
directly in the singular cordinate system seems particularly fruitful, because all the classical
results have this common characteristic. moreover there is in conformal eld theory the
example of kniznik with his idea to associate the elds of a conformal eld theory to the
sheets of a riemann surfaces. a further investigation in this direction is tempting.

2 york time gauge in the second order formalism

we shall adopt in the following the adm formalism, since all our result take the assumption
that space-time can be globally decomposed as (t)  r, where (t) is a set of space-like
surfaces [13, 14]. a particularly meaningful parameterization for the metric revealing the
physically relevant degrees of freedom turns out to be this one:

ds2 = 2dt2  e2|dz  dt|2,

(2.1)

where we have chosen conformal coordinates for the spatial metric. this choice of variable,
the lapse function  and the shift functions , is particularly useful when we discuss how to
solve the eulero-lagrange equations of motion.

the adm decomposition can be performed at the level of the einstein-hilbert action by
splitting it into a spatial part, intrinsic to the surfaces (t), and an extrinsic part, coming
from the embedding , as follows

s = 
1

2z p|g| r(3) d3x + z p|g|d3x =
2z p|g| (cid:2)r(2) + (t rk)2  t r(k 2)(cid:3) d3x + z p|g|d3x,

the extrinsic curvature tensor kij , or second fundamental form of the surface (t), is
i with respect to the spatial part of the metric:

(2.2)

(2.3)

our aim is to simplify at the maximum level the adm scheme applied to (2 + 1) ads
gravity on riemann surfaces . to achieve such simplication a preliminary step is choosing
the conformal coordinates for the spatial metric, which is general if we allow to represent a
riemann surface on a complex plane with branch points ( four branch points for a torus,
2g + 2 for an hyperelliptic surface of genus g, and so on ). this means that the metric has
a singular particle-like behaviour on such branch points, which however must satisfy some

integrability condition, such as a nite area a(t) =r dzdze2 on each spatial slice.

the lagrangian for (2 + 1)-gravity, restricted to a spatial metric in conformal gauge, is

dened by:

l = 2 + e2k 2 
e2
k = 
2

gijkij =

1
2

e2
 |z|

2

 e2

[z(e2) + z(e2) + 0e2].

a simplifying feature appears in the equation of motion for , which reads

zn + e2zk = 0, n =

e2
2

z.

(2.4)

(2.5)

from this equation it is clear that the function n is analytic whenever k = 0 or k = k(t)

is a time-dependent constant. in the following we will show that a convenient choice is



tg(2t)  zn = 0.

k =

therefore our gauge choice is dened by the conditions

gzz = gzz = 0

k =



tg(2t)

,

(2.6)

(2.7)

and thus corresponds to a conformal gauge, with york time gijk ij = 2
the above conditions are enough to eliminate time derivatives from the lagrangian and
to give an instantaneous propagation of the metric, as it appears from the eulero-lagrange
equations for  and :

tg(2t)

.



2 + 4nne2 = (k2(t) + )e2

zn(z) = 0

2  8nn e2 = 2(k2 + )e2 + 20k(t)e2 = 2(k2(t) + )(  2)e2.

(2.8)

to write the last line we have used the property

that works only if

0k(t) = (k2(t) + ),

k(t) =



tg(2t)

or

k(t) = 



cotg(2t)

.

(2.9)

(2.10)

it turns out hat the rst choice is useful to describe the solutions for riemann surfaces,
while the second one is useful to write down solutions for scattering of particles and black
holes.

these equations are dicult to solve directly. however, we will show that in the rst-
order formalism it naturally appears a quite simple structure, related to a couple of o(2, 1)
-models, which automatically solves them.

although not explicit, the appearance of singularities in the metric produce extra 
function sources, localized on the branch points, in the equations of motion (2.8). the t de-
pendence of the riemann surface moduli is therefore provided by the covariant conservation
of the underlying energy-momentum tensor, which in turn implies the geodesic equations
for the branch point singularities.

some solutions in the rst-order formalism

the rst-order formalism gives a direct language for relating holonomies to the physical
metric [15, 16]. for example, in [8] we have proposed a non-perturbative solution for the
metric and the motion of n interacting spinless particles in (2 + 1) gravity, based on a
harmonic mapping x a = x a(t, z, z) from a regular coordinate system to minkowskian
multivalued coordinates.

analogously to what we found for the gauge k = 0, we are going to solve the gauge
condition which corresponds to the solution of the torus coupled to ads (2 + 1)-gravity ,
given by

k = k(t) =



tg(2t)

gzz = 0.

(3.1)

the introduction of the cosmological constant makes useless searching for a simplication
of the equations of motion in the dreibein formalism [17], while it is fruiful to start from

5

the typical construction of space-times with constant curvature [18], that are obtained as an
embedding in a four-dimensional at metric with signature (++):

ds2 = dx adx bab

x axa =

1


.

(3.2)

this formalism can also be considered a rst-order formalism, dening a new dreibein

ea

 = x a, in which the lorentz index depends on four coordinates.

an intrinsic local frame of the four-dimensional space-time is given by these four four-

vectors x a, zx a, zx a and v a, which is dened as

v a = 2ie2abcdxbzxczxd

(3.3)

orthogonal to the rst three ones, and dened to have norm equal to unity. instead zx a and
zx a are two null vectors having a non-vanishing scalar product between them. the gauge
choice made in the second order formalism corresponds to the following set of equations for
the relative immersion x a:

zzx a =


2

e2x a +

k(t)

2

e2v a

2
z x a = 2zzx a + n(z)v a
zv a = 2e2n(z)zx a + k(t)zx a.

(3.4)

we are going to introduce non trivial topology by allowing multivaluedness of x a. in
fact the simplest denition of a genus g riemann surface coupled to ads gravity is the
quotient of the hyperboloid immersed in the (2 + 2) at space-time by a nite set of elements
of the so(2, 2) monodromy group, i.e. we identify all the points that can be reached with
isometries (ui, vi, i = 1, .., g) of the at metric ds2 = dx 2

4 satisfying

0 + dx 2

i = 1.

(3.5)

this means that circling many times around the cycles (ai, bi, i = 1, ...g) of the riemann
surface, the image of a point in the regular coordinate system by the x a mapping is a
lattice of points in the hyperboloid immersed in a at four-dimensional space-time. the
identication of this lattice with a point produces a riemann surface as spatial slice.

for the torus case, eq. (3.5) becomes uv = v u and it is solved by an abelian subgroup
z  z of the so(2, 2) monodromy group, which can be taken as a boost along both the
x0, x3 direction and in the x1, x2 direction. the torus coupled to (2 + 1) ads gravity is
dened by the following holonomy transformations:

6

u :

x 0  ch1x 0 + sh1x 3
x 3  ch1x 3 + sh1x 0
x 1  ch2x 1 + sh2x 2
x 2  ch2x 2 + sh2x 1

v :

x 0  ch1x 0 + sh1x 3
x 3  ch1x 3 + sh1x 0
x 1  ch2x 1 + sh2x 2
x 2  ch2x 2 + sh2x 1

and the at coordinates satisfy the usual quadratic relation

(x 0)2 + (x 1)2  (x 2)2  (x 3)2 =

1


.

(3.6)

(3.7)

based on the solution to the monodromies of the torus we have an algebraic equation

more than the standard condition of embedding:

which is given by

(3.8)

(3.9)

this condition can be interpreted as orthogonality condition between x a and v a :

x a = (x 0, x 1, x 2, x 3)

v a = htg(t)x 0, cotg(t)x 1, cotg(t)x 2,tg(t)x 3i .

(3.10)

if we apply many times from a generic point (x 0, x 1, x 2, x 3) the transformations (u, v )
connected to the cycles (a, b) of the torus, we obtain a lattice of points which belong to the
surface:

x 2
0  x 2

3 =

1  c 2


x 2
1  x 2

2 =

c


.

(3.11)

at a given c such a surface describes again a torus, and the space-time evolution is
simply obtained by allowing a time-dependent constant c = c(t), which in the york time
gauge is

c(t) = sin(t).

(3.13)

the lattice of points on the hyperboloid (3.8) becomes a plane lattice in the (u, y ) coordinates
, which is analogous to a static torus. the rescaling t-dependent factor in front of u and y
is necessary to keep the spatial metric in conformal gauge:

the set of holonomy transformations (3.6) become the following ones which are pure

[1sin(t) + i2cos(t)]
[1sin(t) + i2cos(t)].

the solution to them can be represented as a standard abelian integral on a z-plane with

two branch cuts

w(z, t)

w2(z, t) = r(t)z(z  1)(z  (t)),

(3.16)

where the position of the third singularity (t) is time-dependent, in order to allow that the
translation monodromies are time-dependent (3.15).

therefore, the solution for the torus is given by the composition of the mapping (3.13)

with the abelian integral mapping (3.16).

the holonomies (3.6) tell us that the motion of the branch points is apparently almost
free in the x a coordinates, as they move as geodesics of the hyperboloid (3.7). let us recall

8

that a generic geodesic motion of it is parametrized by the following equation:

x a =

ca
0 ca0 = 1

0 cos(t) + ca
(ca
1 ca1 = m ca
ca

1 sin(t))
0 ca1 = 0

(3.17)

where m is equal to 1, 0,1 respectively for a timelike, null or spacelike geodesic.

taking for example the particle in 0 at rest, the resulting values for the constants ca

i , i =

1, 2 are the following:

ca
0 (1) = (cosh(

(3.18)

in the z-coordinates, only the motion of the third singularity (t) is necessary up to a suitable
rescalings of the z-coordinate, while the other two can remain at rest.

it is straightforward to derive the equations of motion for the modulus of the torus and

for the area, which take the usual form [7],[12]:

 (t) =

1sin(t) + i2cos(t)
1sin(t) + i2cos(t)

a(t) = z dzdz e2 = |

sin(2t)

2

(12  21)|.
(3.19)

the motion of the modulus is essentially a consequence of the free motion in at coordi-
nates of the branch points. it has also to satisfy another consistency condition [12], namely
that the motion of the moduli must be geodesic with respect to the natural metric of the
moduli space, the weil-petersson metric, which in the case of the torus is equivalent to the
poincare metric of the upper half  -plane:

ds2

 =

d d
(im )2 .

(3.20)

the form (3.19) of the solution for the modulus is consistent since it describes a circular

arc in the moduli space, which is a geodesic of the poincare metric.

the corresponding dreibein ea

 = x a is given by ( a = ( 0,1, x, y )) :

(3.25)

so we have found that in the torus case both f and g are real and n is related to the
quadratic holomorphic dierential. in general, we can guess that n(z, t) is a known source
for eq. (3.25), being a combination of the quadratic holomorphic dierentials of the riemann
surface.

the function tanh can also be expected since it diagonalizes the monodromy conditions

for f around the cycles ci = (a, b) of the torus:

bi = sinh

i = 1, 2.

(3.26)

the linear dependence of its argument from the abelian integrals represents the change of
sign f  f around each branch point.

since f and g are real in the case of the torus and their image are contained inside the
unit disk, they map a real variable inside the real diameter d = [1, 1]. since f and g are
polydrome, they can be restricted to cover a segment of d. circling many times around
each cycle of the torus, image f and image g give a tessellation of the diameter.

this particular feature of the torus should be valid in general. for every riemann surface
the image of the maps f and g can be restricted to a polygon inside the corresponding unit
disk. circling many times around each cycle of the riemann surfaces we should obtain
a tessellation of the two unit disks, instead of their diameters, as a consequence of the
nonabelian relation (3.5) which replaces the abelian one uv = v u for the torus.

another interesting case is the -mapping for static riemann surfaces, which is the case

f = g, t = 2t, where the -mapping reduces to :

1

x a =

hcos(2t), sin(2t)nii
v a = hsin(2t), cos(2t)nii ,
1  f f(cid:19) .
ni = (cid:18) 1 + f f

1  f f

1  f f

2f

2f

,

,

(3.27)

a similar mapping has been discussed in [19]. the particular relation (3.27) between at
x a-coordinates and f realizes explicitly the isomorphism between the subgroup so(2, 1)
of so(2, 2) and su(1, 1), and the mobius transformations of f correspond to the so(2, 1)
holonomies for the x a coordinates.

we easily recognize that the at coordinates satisfy the constraint:

(x 1)2  x zx z =

sin2(2t)



.

(3.28)

the same surface can be obtain starting from a generic point x a

0 and applying all the
so(2, 1) movements related to the cycles (ai, bi). hence this time foliation is natural since
it is induced by the holonomies.

the x = x(x) mapping (3.27) produces the hyperbolic metric on the disk:

from which we can read  = 2,  = 0 and e2 = 4 sin2t

which solve eq. (2.8).

ds2 = 4dt2  4

the conformal mapping f (z) still has to be determined. firstly, we remember that every
genus g riemann surfaces is determined by a fundamental group 1() generated by the 2g
holonomies ( ui, vi) satisfying the relation (3.5). let us denote with h the unit disk with
its metric of negative constant curvature. the group su(1, 1) acts on it, maintaining its
metric. consider a subgroup of it   su(1, 1), isomorphic to 1(), the quotient h/ is a
riemann surface of genus g, with the same constant curvature metric of the unit disk h.

therefore, we can think that the image of the conformal mapping f gives a tessellation
of the unit disk on which the holonomy acts as su(1, 1) and we can restrict the fundamental
region of imf to be inside a closed geodesic 4g-gon of the unit disk with hyperbolic metric,
where the conformal mapping becomes one to one.

for pure so(2, 1) holonomies, the equations of motion for the branch points are simply

trivial timelike geodesic of the constraint x axa = 1
 .

since the x a = x a(x) mapping in eq.

(3.27) has also a trivial time dependence,
we conclude that there is no evolution in the z-coordinate for the branch points. as a
consequence, there is no time evolution for the moduli [12], and the only time dependence
comes from the overall scale factor sin2t in eq. (3.29). we can suppose that the branch
points i have xed positions on the real axis. then to nd the gauss map f it is helpful this
theorem of complex analysis: given a simple and closed geodesic polygon  of the poincare
metric in the upper half w-plane, whose sides are circular arcs making angles 1, 2, ...,
n, at the vertices a1, a2, ..., an where 0  j  2, then there exist real numbers 1, 2, ...n,
1, 2, ...n such that

the points j correspond to the vertices aj. a simple conformal mapping relates the
upper w-plane endowed with the poincare metric to the f -unit disk with the hyperbolic
metric.

let us remark that in order to obtain the tessellation property of the unit disk, the angles
i must be chosen as (1  1/ni), with ni positive integers. such a mapping problem has
been investigated in connection to fuchsian groups and functions. in fact, to each geodesic
polygon of the f -unit disk, whose angles in the vertices have the measure (1  1/ni), with
ni positive integers, it is connected a discrete group of movements  and an analytic function
z(f ) dened in the f -unit disk, which is invariant under the  action on the f variable.

bkf + ak(cid:19) = z(f )

z(x a) = z((k)a

k.

(3.33)

the  group of su(1,1) mobius transformations on the disk is called fuchsian group.
the function z(f ) is a fuchsian function with respect to the group . instead the inverse
f = f (z) is polydrome, and it can be restricted to map the z-plane into the geodesic polygon.
therefore we conclude that our conformal mapping is the inverse of such fuchsian function
z(f ). examples of them can be built from the poincare series, having a simple covariant
transformation under the fuchsian group, from which we can obtain a fuchsian function,
invariant under the action of the fuchsian group.

4 general solution for the immersion equation

the example of the torus can teach us a lot of information for the general case. we are
going to discuss that we have already found the more general equations that constrain the
dynamics of every riemann surface.

let us introduce a set of notations to be more comprehensible. in general the o(2, 2)

cuts can be decomposed as products of su(1, 1) cuts as

  x t x z

x

t !   a1 b1

b1 a1 !  x t x z

(h1 u a + hu a)

(h w a + h1w a) =

(4.4)

where we dene the following vectorial functions of f and g, which have not real components:

but the vectors x a and v a
0 have real components, being coordinates. this global vector
covariance can be useful in characterizing the scalar product of these vectors and their
derivatives in terms of the invariants under the global so(2,2) monodromy group.

as an example we can list the following identities :

w  w = u  u = 1/2
w  zw =

w  u = (w  u )1

we also introduce the denition of the various invariants that will be useful in the fol-

(4.6)

and analogously for g.

now let ask ourself the following question: can v a

0 be identied with the vector v a
which appears in the immersion equations (3.4) ? the answer is negative and positive at
the same time, negative if we decide to work with general unconstrained elds, positive in
practice, since if we look for a simple gauge xed solution then it is possible to make such
identication. let us work out the dierence:

14

v a = (v a

0 + zx a + zx a)

(4.7)

in which the coecients  and  are derived in such a way to satisfy the properties of

v a:

 = 2e2v a

0  zx a =

e2[zln(h)  h g + h f ]

(4.8)

moreover, it will useful in the following to compute the derivative of this vector zv a
can be again parametrized in terms of the basis of the 4 four-vectors

0 , that

zv a

0 = 0x a + 1v a + 2zx a + 3zx a

(4.9)

where

coming from :

(4.13)

inserting the general parametrization (4.3) in the rst series of identities (4.12) we get

the following constraints:

on the other hand the explicit computation of these scalar product based on their de-

putting all the information together we nally obtain the following fundamental relations:

(4.17)

it seems not possible to think that these equations satisfy with only one more relation all the
immersion identities, but in reality it is like this, and the purpose of computing the second
series of identities is to show that eqs. (4.17) are completely self-consistent.

if one choose the case f = g these equations reduce to the following ones

(4.18)

this case is a little misleading, since in the point of view of the present article it only
corresponds to n(z) = 0 and if = ig = 0, in the nal simplied gauge choice. however one
can recover from it another result, stated in reference [22], valid for a dierent gauge choice
k = 0, where such simplication is not possible.

let us compute the following scalar products

(4.27)

finally the torus case and the static riemann surface case have in common the following
simple solution of all these constraints, namely that t = t (t) and  = 0, and by consequence

that 0 = 1 = 0 , 2 = k e 3 = 2e2n(z), and moreover that en = n,ek = k.

5 the gauge  = 0

in 2 + 1 gravity the gauge conditions k = 0 and gzz = 0 were enough to x completely the
elds. here the same remark cannot be applied. the reason for this strange behaviour of
ads gravity lies in the fact that are no natural boundary conditions on the elds at innity,
therefore we have more freedom to x the gauge.

19

we are going to choose the boundary conditions in such a way that the equations of
motion can be expressed by the simplest choice. it is not dicult to nd such a gauge. in
fact, we can be inspired by the simplest solutions that we have at disposition, the solutions
for the torus and for the static riemann surfaces, which have in common the auxiliary
condition  = 0. if we take seriously such a condition in general, for every riemann surface,
we obtain a drastic simplication in the expression for the equations of motion, practically
the simplest one that we have could written obeying all the physical requirements we have
discussed so far:

if eit = igeit =

n(z)
2sint

hf = hg = 0.

(5.1)


tg(t ) .

moreover it is true that 0 = 1 = 0, ek = k, en = n and t = 2t, k =

we know that an analitic solution of the monodromy conditions for f and g is pratically
impossible for particles, because it gives rise to many problems, for example the fact that
the horizon dened by the condition |f| = 1 doesnt match in generally with the condition
|g| = 1, which is a quite important constraint, to know where the spatial slice of the universe
ends, or the problem how to give motion to the particles, since for an analitic solution the
geodesic equations are undened ( see [21] for an analysis of such problems ). for reasons of
symmetry with the particle case we believe that analogous problems would also appear for
riemann surfaces.

this is the simplest equation for a non-analytic solution to the monodromies, analogous
to what we have discussed for the torus, a couple of rst integrals of two o(2, 1) sigma
models.

moreover both the rst set of equations (4.12) coming from the embedding equations (3.4)
that the second one (4.21) are solved if we add to the system of conditions (5.1) another
fundamental equation:

e2f = e2g =



4sin2t

e2.

(5.2)

in this way, the static equation of sine-gordon type for  is solved automatically as in

the case of the torus, and moreover the following integral condition holds:

zs 2 = 4zs

df  df

1  |f|2 = 4zs

dg  dg
1  |g|2 .

(5.3)

20

6 a corollary: scattering of black holes

as a corollary for these set of simplifyed equations we can consider the scattering of back
holes [20], in which the gauge choice can be taken again as the condition  = 0 with the only
change that t  t + 
2 .

one of the problems that were bothering me about building a solution for the scattering
of black holes, was the fact the gauge choice conformal gzz = 0 cannot be necessarily global
but it can be extended only until the region external to the horizons, where the time is well
dened and distinct from a spatial coordinate. therefore there is not only the spatial end of
the universe, but also two internal horizons on which the condition |f| = |g| = 1 must hold.
necessarily we have to impose that the locus of points dened by the rst condition
|f| = 1 coincides with the locus of points dened by the second condition |g| = 1. but this
requirement of physical consistency is already inside the equation of consistency of the gauge
 = 0:

f = g,

(6.1)

because whenever the rst condition holds implies that e2f is divergent as 1/(1  |f|2),
and this equation (6.1) automatically requires that there is an analogous divergency of e2g
as 1/(1|g|2). therefore the set of equations proposed (5.1) and (5.2) is complete and must
contain the physically consistent solution for the scattering of black holes. there are no
extra conditions to be added since these are already contained in the equation (6.1).

we can suggest how to solve the monodromy conditions directly, by requiring that our
unknown f is analytic with respect to an intermediate variable w ( this partial analyticity
tell us how to makes sense to the word cut in a non-analytic setting ),

f = f (w(z, z, t),

f (w) = w(z, z, t)c1

f (a, b, c; w(z, z, t))

f (a  c + 1, b  c + 1, 2  c : w(z, z, t))

,

(6.2)

which is single-valued with respect to the physical complex variable z, but it is also a non triv-
ial reparametrization of it. a quite non trivial constraint on the choice for the reparametriza-
tion w(z, z, t) comes from the requirement that the whole solution satises the o(2, 1) sigma
model.

in this way the problem of dening the geodesic equations for the particles or the black
holes is reduced to nd the time-dependent part of this reparametrization, which at the end
is responsible for their motion. instead the monodromy conditions are already satised at
all orders by a careful choice of the coecients for the hypergeometric function. we will

21

show in a forecoming paper what type of solution is obtained, by doing perturbation with
respect to the parameter  [23].

7 discussion

we have shown here that the rst-order formalism, that has allowed us to solve the n-
body problem, can be extended to the case of riemann surfaces in (2 + 1) gravity with
cosmological constant.

we have found how to recover from the solution of two o(2, 1) -model a general solution
of all einstein equations. the solution is also characterized by an analytic function n(z)
which is the component kzz of the extrinsic curvature tensor. the two solutions of the o(2, 1)
sigma model map the z-complex plane with branch cuts into a direct product of unit disks
with hyperbolic metric. the holonomies of f and g are elements of su(1, 1)  su(1, 1) and
isometries of the corresponging hyperbolic metric. therefore we can delimitate imf  img
into a direct product of geodesic polygons inside the two unit disk. this property is not
generally true for the analogous mappings f and g of the n-particle, since in that case there
is a boundary to the spatial slice of the universe, ad the limit |f| = 1 and |g| = 1 are reached.
in the case of the scattering of black holes these limit are reached not only to represent the
spatial innity but also their horizons.
instead the peculiar signal of topology should be
that these mappings produce a tessellation of the two unit disks, a property which is not
true for the particle case. the line dened by |f| = 1 is not reached by the riemann surface
solutions.

we have given explicit solutions for the mapping functions f and g for the torus and
for all riemann surfaces having so(2, 1) holonomies. it turns out that in both cases the
inverse mapping z = z(f ) is a single-valued function, i.e. an automorphic function. the
n(z) function for the torus is related to the quadratic holomorphic dierential, a property
that is probably true for all riemann surfaces.

we have found that the so(2, 2) holonomies have a quite simple particle interpretation.
they determine the evolution for the branch points, which move as timelike geodesic of the
(3.8) hyperboloid in the embedding at four-dimensional space-time.

the moduli trajectories, which have to be geodesic of the metric of teichmuller space,

should be a consequence of the geodesic trajectories of the branch points.

the next step would be to nd a quantization scheme which takes into account this

classical reduction of three dimensional gravity in two-dimensional eld theories.

a appendix - first-order formalism in the limit   0

we would like to clarify how the second-order equations are solved by the simplied choice
of the rst-order solution. let us notice rstly that the conformal factor can be written in
two equivalent ways:

e2 =

n(z).

(a.1)

the equation for the conformal factor  is solved because it can be written as:

2 = 4

(1  f f )

zf zf  zfzf

2

zgzg  zgzg

= 4

.

(a.2)

(1  gg)2

in this way it is pratically identical to the equation of motion that we solved for the torus
case in (2 + 1)gravity ( see appendix of ref. [11] ). the only dierence of this case is that
the same mechanism of solution is repeated twice, once for the function f and the other time
for the function g.

analogously the equation for is solved by looking at the denition of the eld  in terms

of rst-order quantities:

zz = zzv a  0x a + zv a  0zx a + zv a  0zx a + v a  zzx a.

(a.3)

by rearranging the embedding equations (3.4) we can nd the following properties:

zzv a = (cid:18)2nn e2 +
e2 + 0(cid:18)k(t)

v a  0zzx a =
zv a  0zx a = k(t)zx a  0zx a.
