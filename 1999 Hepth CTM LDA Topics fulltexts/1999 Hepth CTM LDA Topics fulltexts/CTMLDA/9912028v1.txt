abstract

we present what we believe is the minimal three-family ads/cf t model

compactied on a nonabelian orbifold s5/(q  z3). nontrivial irreps of the

discrete nonabelian group q  z3 are identied with the 4 of su (4) r sym-

metry to break all supersymmetries, and the scalar content of the model is

sucient to break the gauge symmetry to the standard model. according to

the conformality hypothesis the progenitor su (4)3  su (2)12 theory becomes

conformally invariant at an infra-red xed point of the renormalization group.

the concept of duality has always proven to be one of the most useful tools in advancing

theoretical physics, beginning with the duality between x and p in classical and quantum

mechanics. further examples include wave-particle duality which is closely related to x-p

duality, the duality between e and b in maxwells equations, the instanton solutions of self-

dual yang-mills equations, the kramers-wannier duality between low and high temperature

in a condensed-matter phase transition, and dual resonance models which were the precursor

to string theory. more recently there is the duality between weak and strong coupling eld

theories and then between all the dierent superstring theories that has led to a revolution in

our understanding of strings. most recently, and equally profound, is the ads/cft duality

which is the subject of the present article. this ads/cft duality is between string theory

compactied on anti-de-sitter space and conformal field theory.

until very recently, the possibility of testing string theory seemed at best remote. the

advent of ads/cf t s and large-scale string compactication suggest this point of view may

be too pessimistic, since both could lead to  100t ev evidence for strings. with this

thought in mind, we are encouraged to build ads/cf t models with realistic fermionic

structure, and reduce to the standard model below  1t ev .

using ads/cft duality, one arrives at a class of gauge eld theories of special recent

interest. the simplest compactication of a ten-dimensional superstring on a product of an

ads space with a ve-dimensional spherical manifold leads to an n = 4 su(n) supersym-

metric gauge theory, well known to be conformally invariant [1]. by replacing the manifold

s5 by an orbifold s5/ one arrives at less supersymmetries corresponding to n = 2, 1 or 0

depending [2] on whether   su(2), su(3), or 6 su(3) respectively, where  is in all

cases a subgroup of su(4)  so(6) the isometry of the s5 manifold.

it was conjectured in [3] that such su(n) gauge theories are conformal in the n  

limit. in [4] it was conjectured that at least a subset of the resultant nonsupersymmetric

n = 0 theories are conformal even for nite n. some rst steps to check this idea were

made in [5]. model-building based on abelian  was studied further in [68], arriving in [8]

at an su(3)7 model based on  = z7 which has three families of chiral fermions, a correct

2

value for sin2 and a conformal scale  10 tev.

the case of non-abelian orbifolds bases on non-abelian  has not previously been studied,

partially due to the fact that it is apparently somewhat more mathematically sophisticated.

however, we shall show here that it can be handled equally as systematically as the abelian

case and leads to richer structures and interesting results.

we consider all non-abelian discrete groups of order g < 32. these are described in detail

in [9,10]. there are exactly 45 such non-abelian groups. because the gauge group arrived

at by this construction [6] is isu(ndi) where di are the dimensions of the irreducible

representations of , one can expect to arrive at models such as the pati-salam su(4) 

su(2)  su(2) type [11] by choosing n = 2 and combining two singlets and a doublet in

the 4 of su(4). indeed we shall show that such an accommodation of the standard model

is possible by using a non-abelian .

the procedures for building a model within such a conformality approach are: (1) choose

; (2) choose a proper embedding   su(4) by assigning the components of the 4 of su(4)

to irreps of , while at the same time ensuring that the 6 of su(4) is real; (3) choose n, in

the gauge group isu(ndi). (4) analyse the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

in the present study we shall choose n = 2 and aim at the gauge group su(4)su(2)

su(2). to obtain chiral fermions, it is necessary [6] that the 4 of su(4) be complex 4 6= 4.

actually this condition is not quite sucient to ensure chirality in the present case because

of the pseudoreality of su(2). we must ensure that the 4 is not just pseudoreal.

this last condition means that many of our 45 candidates for  do not lead to chiral

fermions. for example,  = q2n  su(2) has irreps of appropriate dimensionalities for our

purpose but it will not sustain chiral fermions under su(4)  su(2)  su(2) because these

irreps are all, like su(2), pseudoreal.1 applying the rule that 4 must be neither real nor

pseudoreal leaves a total of only 19 possible non-abelian discrete groups of order g  31.

1note that were we using n  3 then a pseudoreal 4 would give chiral fermions.

3

the smallest group which avoids pseudoreality has order g = 16 but gives only two families.

the technical details of our systematic search will be postponed to a future publication.

here we shall present only the simplest interesting non-abelian case which has g = 24 and

gives three chiral families in a pati-salam-type model [11].

before proceeding to the details of the specic g = 24 case, it is worth reminding the

reader that the conformal field theory (cft) that it exemplies should be free of all diver-

gences, even logarithmic ones, if the conformality conjecture is correct, and be completely

nite. further the theory is originating from a superstring theory in a higher-dimension

(ten) and contains gravity [1214] by compactication of the higher-dimensional graviton

already contained in that superstring theory. in the cft as we derive it, gravity is absent

because we have not kept these graviton modes - of course, their inuence on high-energy

physics experiments is generally completely negligible unless the compactication scale is

large [15]; here we shall neglect the eects of gravity.

to motivate our model it is instructive to comment on the choice of  and on the choice

of embedding.

if we embed only four singlets of  in the 4 of su(4) then this has the eect of abelianizing

 and the gauge group obtained in the chiral sector of the theory is su(n)q. these cases

can be interesting but have already been studied [6,7]. thus, we require at least one irrep

of  to have di  2 in the embedding.

the only  of order g  31 with a 4 is z5 z4 and this embedding leads to a non-chiral

theory. this leaves only embeddings with two singlets and a doublet, a triplet and a singlet

or two doublets.

the third of these choices leads to richer structures for low order . concentrating on

them shows that of the chiral models possible, those from groups of low order result in an

insucient number (below three) of chiral families.

the rst group that can lead to exactly three families occurs at order g = 24 and is

 = z3  q where q( q4) is the group of unit quarternions which is the smallest dicyclic

group q2n.

4

there are several potential models due to the dierent choices for the 4 of su(4) but

only the case 4 = (1, 1, 2) leads to three families so let us describe this in some detail:

since q  z3 is a direct product group, we can write the irreps as ri  a where ri is

a q irrep and a is a z3 irrep. we write q irreps as 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 while the irreps of z3

are all singlets which we call , 2, 3 = 1. thus q  z3 has veteen irreps in all and the

gauge group will be of pati-salam type for n = 2.

if we wish to break all supersymmetry, the 4 may not contain the trivial singlet of .

due to permutational symmetry among the singlets it is suciently general to choose 4 =

(1a1, 1a2, 2a3) with a1 6= 0.

to x the ai we note that the scalar sector of the theory which is generated by the

6 of su(4) can be used as a constraint since the 6 is required to be real. this leads to

a1 + a2 = 2a3(mod 3). up to permutations in the chiral fermion sector the most general

choice is a1 = a3 = +1 and a2 = 0. hence our choice of embedding is

4 = (1, 1



, 2)

6 = (1



, 2, 22, 1

with

which is real as required.

we are now in a position to summarize the particle content of the theory. the fermions

where the ri are all the irreps of  = q  z3. this is:

which is easily checked to be real.

the gauge group su(4)3 su(2)12 with chiral fermions of eq.(4) and scalars of eq.(6) is

expected to acquire confromal invariance at an infra-red xed point of the renormalization

group, as discussed in [4].

to begin our examination of the symmetry breaking we rst observe that if we break

the three su(4)s to the totally diagonal su(4), then chirality in the fermionic sector is

lost. to avoid this we break su1(4) completely and then break su(4)  su2(4) to its

diagonal subgroup sud(4). the rst of these steps can be achieved with vevs of the form

[(41, 2bk) + h.c.] where we are free to choose b, but k must be 1 or 2 since there are no

(41, 2bk=0) scalars. the second step requires an

sud(4) singlet vev from (4,42) and/or (4, 42). once we make a choice for b (we

take b = 4), the remaining chiral fermions are, in an intuitive notation:

a=1 h(2a , 1, 4d) + (1, 2a1, 4d)i

p3

which has the same content as as a three family pati-salam model, though with a separate

sul(2)  sur(2) per family.

to further reduce the symmetry we must arrange to break to a single sul(2) and a

single sur(2). this is achieved by modifying step one where su1(4) was broken. consider

6

the block diagonal decomposition of su1(4) into su1l(2)  su1r(2). the representations

(2a, 41) and (2a1, 41) then decompose as

(2a, 41)  (2a, 2, 1) + (2a, 1, 2) and (2a1, 41)  (2a1, , 2, 1) + (2a1, 1, 2). now

if we give v ev s of equal magnitude to the (2a, , 2, 1), a = 1, 2, 3, and equal magnitude

v ev s to the (2a1, 1, 2) a = 1, 2, 3, we break su1l(2) 

3

qa=1

su(2a) to a single sul(2)

and we break su1r(2) 

3

qa=1

su(2a) to a single sur(2). finally, v ev s for (24, 2, 1) and

(24, 1, 2) as well as (241, 2, 1) and (241, 1, 2) insures that both su(24) and su(241)

are broken and that only three families remain chiral. the nal set of chiral fermions is then

3[(2, 1, 4) + (1, 2, 4)] with gauge symmetry sul(2)  sur(2)  sud(4).

to achieve the nal reduction to the standard model, an adjoint vev from (4,42)

and/or (4,42) is used to break sud(4) to the su(3)  u(1), and a right handed doublet

is used to break sur(2).

while this completes our analysis of symmetry breaking, it is worthwhile noting the

degree of constraint imposed on the symmetry and particle content of a model as the number

of irreps nr of the discrete group  associated with the choice of orbifold changes. the

number of guage groups grows linearly in nr, the number of scalar irreps grows roughly

quadratically with nr, and the chiral fermion content is highly  dependent. if we require

the minimal  that is large enough for the model generated to contain the fermions of the

standard model and have sucient scalars to break the symmetry to that of the standard

model, then  = q  z3 appears to be that minimal choice [16].

although a decade ago the chances of testing string theory seemed at best remote, recent

progress has given us hope that such tests may indeed be possible in ads/cfts. the madel

provided here demonstrates the standard model can be accomodated in these theories and

suggests the possibility of a rich spectrum of new physics just around the tev corner.
