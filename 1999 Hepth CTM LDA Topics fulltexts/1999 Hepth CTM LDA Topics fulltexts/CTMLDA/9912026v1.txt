abstract

we present a systematic study of one, two and three point functions of vector, axial-
vector, scalar and pseudoscalar densities constructed in a free fermion model. the diver-
gent content of the amplitudes are left in the form of (external momenta independent)
4-d integrals for which an appropriate regulating function is only implicitly assumed,
and the integrals are not evaluated at any step of the calculation. the ambiguities and
symmetries violations, in all cases, are shown to be associated with coecients involv-
ing three relations between divergent integrals of the same degree of divergence. setting
these coecients to zero is mandatory, e.g., for preserving gauge symmetry in qed. the
implications for the ambiguities and symmetry violations are investigated. the results
emerging from this alternative approach allow us to conclude that the traditional method
used to establish the triangular anomalies could be questionable.

1 introduction

quantum field theory is nowadays our main tool for the investigation of the elementary
particle interactions. this is also due to the fact that it allows us to study the con-
sequences of symmetries assumed relevant, our fundamental working hypothesis. since
this is seldom possible in an exact way, perturbative techniques become most relevant.
unfortunately this type of solution is plagued with mathematical problems coming from
divergent integrals. we are therefore forced to have recourse of auxiliary techniques based
on regularization schemes in order to extract the physical content of calculated amplitudes.
regularization schemes invariably modify the amplitudes, as dictated by feynman rules,
and consequently provide an interpretation for the mathematical indenitions in the prob-
lem. frequently the nal results become regularization-scheme dependent and may not
reect the full dynamical content of the underlying theory.
in this context one of the
main issues is the question of ambiguities associated with arbitrary momentum routing
in loops and that of symmetry relations [1]. many of these fundamental questions have
been adequately solved after the construction of dimensional regularization [2]. there is
however one important issue which, due to the mathematical limitation of the technique,
could not be handled, namely the pseudoamplitudes. perhaps this is the reason why even
nowadays the treatment given to such amplitudes have recourse of methods completely
discarded in all cases where d.r. applies. we refer specically to the problem of triangle
anomalies, which has been discussed in the pioneer work of gerstein and jackiw [1]. they
proposed that surface terms, which are in turn equivalent to admit an intrinsic ambigu-
ity of the divergent amplitudes, are responsible for the existence of symmetry violations
in several of such amplitudes. this point of view is completely discarded for all other
cases since it represents the violation of the most basic symmetry principle present in the
original theory, which is the space-time homogeneity (translational invariance). despite
of this, even in modern text books [3], anomalies are presented as associated with such
ambiguities. on the other hand anomalies are shown to emerge even in theories destituted
of divergences and predicted by general arguments in qft. it seems to have no doubt
about their existence. therefore it is reasonable to believe that it must be possible to
establish their existence without having to appeal to ambiguities, even when divergent
amplitudes are involved.

this work is devoted to question the origin of anomalies as they are usually presented
in the literature and providing a universal point of view to treat divergencies in the

2

sense that all amplitudes are handled by the same prescription. for this purpose we
appeal to a technique to manipulate and calculate divergent integrals which has recently
been proposed [4] and successfully applied to the problem of ambiguities in the context
of the gauged njl model [5], [6] solving those crucial question raised in the literature
[7]. this method so far has proved to be an adequate tool to treat all questions related
with divergencies from the renormalization of standard theories like qed [8], [9] and
for the calculation of renormalization group coecients [10].
in this context we turn
in the present work to perhaps the historically most relevant question that involves the
association between the violation of symmetry relations and ambiguities. the advantage
of the method adopted here is that it allows an immediate connection with other current
approaches.
in particular we can use the consistent results obtained by d.r. where it
applies as element of the analysis for the search of an universal interpretation.
it is
most desirable to obtain the anomalies in a natural way within a context which treats all
anomalous and nonanomalous amplitudes according to the same scheme. this is better
done in two steps. first (as in the present work) one must check wether the current way
as followed in ref.[1] for calculating e.g. the famous axial anomaly remains appropriate
when used to investigate other symmetry relations. in other words, anomalies must also
emerge in a treatment designed to consistently handle all other amplitudes, i.e., where
ambiguities are necessary absent. we show as a consequence of a thorough analysis that
d.r. and the prescription of ref.[1] are conicting, i.e., cannot be mapped by a universal
interpretation. an important result of thus analysis is that when we demand complete
mapping of the present results (in 4-d) with those of d.r. we obtain a set of conditions
which are not compatible with any symmetry violation even in the anomalous cases. this
indicates that the adopted procedure which makes use only of two point functions is not
completely consistent. in view of the present results we conclude that nal and decisive
statements about three point function symmetry relations can only be made after an
explicit calculation of these amplitudes. this is the second step. it is possible to show that
anomalies emerge in a natural way with the correct value [11] without having to admit
ambiguities and within an interpretation which is universal in a sense that consistent
results are obtained for all amplitudes in the same way [4].

as discussed before we consider the free fermion model of ref.[1] discarding however
internal symmetries, which are irrelevant for our purposes.
in section 2 we dene the
model, notation and relevant ward identities. in section 3 we briey establish the oper-
ational strategy for the manipulation and calculation of divergent amplitudes. in section

3

4 a study of ambiguities is presented in one and two point functions calculated explicitly
with arbitrary momentum routing. we also explicitate the ambiguous terms of the three
point functions. in section 5 we reproduce (from our results) those of ref.[1]. in section 6
we discuss ward identities. the nal remarks are contained in section 7.

2 denitions, notation and current algebra results

for the model

we start introducing the notation to be used and dening the quantities we will be
concerned with for the rest of the work. we closely follow ref.[1] with which we compare
our results.

let us consider a spin 1/2, mass m free fermion model. there will be therefore a
massive eld which obeys diracs equation and with which we can construct currents
ji(x) dened by

ji(x) = (x)i(x),

where i are the dirac matrices responsible for the transformation of currents:

i = [s(x); p (x); v(x); a(x)] = [1; 5; ; i5]

(1)

(2)

characterizing the scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector and axial densities. an important property
in this model is the value of the four divergencies

v(x) = 0
a(x) = 2mp (x),

(3)




and their commutation relations at equal times. with the above denitions and the
fermionic propagator

isf (p) =

i

p/  m

,

(4)

it is possible to construct n-point functions, which we dene in the same way as in ref.[1]
as follows

 one point functions:

t i(k1, m) = z

d4k

(2)4 t r(i

1

[(k/ + k/1)  m]) ,

(5)

4

 two point functions:

t ij(k1, m; k2, m) = z

d4k

(2)4 t r(i

1

[(k/ + k/1)  m]

j

1

[(k/ + k/2)  m])

(6)

 three point functions:

t lij(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m) =
1

d4k

(2)4 t r(l

z

[(k/ + k/3)  m]

i

1

[(k/ + k/1)  m]

j

1

[(k/ + k/2)  m]) ,

(7)

and so on. here the k1, k2 and k3 represent the arbitrary choice for the internal
momenta of the loop. energy momentum conservation only requires these quantities
must be related with the external momenta, e.g., in the three point functions we
have: k3  k1 = p, k1  k2 = p and k3  k2 = q.

in our notation the vertex to the left is assumed to be connected with the initial
state with external momentum q and the vertex operator l. the other two vertices
correspond to nal states with external momenta p and p and the vertex operators i
e j respectively. besides the upper indices are associated (see gure), in the order they
appear, with the respective lorentz indices in the same order, whenever is the case. as
an example if l = ; i = i5 and j = 5 we have

t v ap



(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m).

(8)

this notation emphasizes the masses and momenta carried by the internal lines and
characterizes each diagram completely. in particular this means that in the case we have
one particle in the initial state and two on the nal one, symmetrization in the nal
states will be required. for example for the process s  v v we dene the corresponding
amplitude as

t sv v



= t sv v



(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m) + t sv v



(l1, m; l2, m; l3, m)

(9)

the rst term represents the direct channel and the second the crossed channel.

there are integral representations for the functions dened above with the fourier

transform of the currents

< j1(q)j2(q) > z eipxd4x < 0|t (j1(x)j2(0)|0 >

(10)

in the case of two point functions and

< j1(p)j2(p)j3(q) > z eipxeipyd4xd4y < 0|t (j1(x)j2(y)j3(0))|0 >

(11)

for the three point functions. with these elements and the standard methods of cur-
rent algebra [3], [11] one can establish relations among the n-point functions, i.e., ward
identities. for the simple model in question such symmetry relations are reduced to the
conservation of the vector current and the well known proportionality of the divergent
of the axial current and the pseudoscalar one. it is important to remark that such rela-
tions are exact and should be satised despite the divergent character of up to n-point
functions.

this brief discussion summarizes the dilemma one has to face when calculating diver-
gent amplitudes: to maitain their properties after the calculation. it is our purpose to
investigate under which conditions it is possible to evaluate these amplitudes and to get
consistent results in what concerns ambiguities and symmetry relations.

3 proposed strategy to manipulate divergent inte-

grals

for the following calculations we will handle divergent amplitudes without explicit use of
a specic regulating function. however to assume an implicit regulator in the integrands
satisfying some properties;

such that the connection limit exists, i.e.,

z d4kf (k)  z d4kf (k)g(k2)

lim



g(k2) = 1,

(47)

(48)

and, consequently, nite contributions can be integrated without restrictions. on general
grounds the regulating function should be even in k, and assuming an implicit regulating
function and performing the dirac traces we identify the set of divergent integrals to
be dealt with. next we manipulate each integral by using identities at the level of the
integrand such that all the dependence on external momenta must be contained by the
nite terms. for the present model all the divergent content of the amplitudes will be
restricted to two integrals which we dene as

and

(2)4

(k2  m2)

iquad(m2) = z
ilog(m2) = z

d4k
(2)4

1

(k2  m2)2 .

(49)

(50)

at the end the results obtained will not be committed to any specic regularization
scheme. the current reported results with well known schemes can easily be obtained

9

from our expressions. the main advantage in using the new precept is that we will be
able to realize which are the conditions to be satised by any regularization prescription
in order to avoid ambiguities and undesirable symmetry violations.

4 ambiguities

the integral representation, eq.(6), for two point functions indicates, by power counting,
that it is quadratically divergent. also, eq.(7) indicates that the three point functions
are linearly divergent. in ref.[1] the adopted point of view is that, even after the nite
content of the integrals are extracted, they remain ambiguous quantities. the reason
for this is that the energy-momentum conservation relations do not uniquely specify the
internal momenta in the loop.
it is possible to make dierent choices for the internal
momentum label. such choices can only be equivalent if shifts in the integration variable
is allowed, which is not the case for linearly and quadratically divergent integrals [1], [3].
following we explicitly evaluate the up to three point greens functions in detail in order
to illustrate our strategy for the manipulation and calculation of the divergent objects.
special attention will be paid for the question of ambiguities showing how they can be
systematically eliminated in the present calculation.

4.1 one point functions

we start by considering the one point vector amplitude t v
 . according to the standard
procedure this function contains one fermionic propagator and the vertex operator i =
. it is dened as

t v

 = z

d4k

(2)4 t r(

1

(k/ + k/1)  m) ,

after the trace is taken we get

t v

 = 4(z

d4k
(2)4

k

(k + k1)2  m2 + k1z

d4k
(2)4

1

(k + k1)2  m2) .

(51)

(52)

from the above equation we see that we get two divergent integrals, one of cubic
and the other of quadratic divergences. following our strategy we admit the presence
of a implicit regulator as discussed before. in order to indicate its presence we use the
subscript  in the integral and proceed to the necessary manipulations of the integrand.

with we odd integrals vanishing. the two last integrals are nite and can therefore be
integrated without restrictions cancelling each other. the remaining divergent integrals,
easily identied in eq.(53), are left in integral form. for the quadratically divergent
integral, performing the same kind of algebraic manipulations at the level of the integrand
results

the above procedure clearly states our strategy for handling the feynmam diagrams.
as we anticipated, we make use only of algebraic manipulations at the integrand level
and the irrestrict integration of nite contributions. in these the subscript  has been
removed since in the connection limit the integrals can be performed without restrictions.
let us now treat the remaining one point functions within the same calculational

scheme. let us take following scalar function

t s = z

(2)4 t r(1

(k/ + k/1)  m)

which, after diracs trace yields

t s = 4mz

(59)

(60)

the quadratically divergent integral has already been discussed in the previous exam-

ple and can be written as

t s = 4mniquad(m2) + k1k1o .

(61)

in the above result we verify that the amplitude t s is expressed in terms of two
divergent objects, iquad(m2) and , the latter again related to the arbitrary momentum
label k1. for the moment we only comment that the two calculated amplitudes are
potentially ambiguous due to the presence of such terms in the nal expression.

it is a simple matter to check that the other one point functions identically t a

 and

t p vanish due the properties of the trace of the corresponding dirac matrices.

4.2 two point functions

let us calculate the two point functions within the same scheme. we start by considering
the simplest of the two point functions with two scalar vertices. using feynman rules
with two propagators and appropriate vertices we write

t ss = z

d4k

(2)4 t r(1

(k/ + k/1)  m

(k/ + k/2)  m) ,

(62)

where k1 and k2 stand for the arbitrary shifts in the internal momentum routing, as before,
and will systematically locate ambiguities, wherever the case may be. taking diracs trace

12

we have

t ss = 2(z

priate manipulations to cast it into the form

the next two point function to be considered is relevant in electrodynamics, since it
is related to the polarization tensor. we therefore expect it to be unambiguous and to
have its ward identities satised. it is the vector-vector amplitude given by

4.3 three point functions

we now come to the three point functions. in order not to overload the text we limit our-
selves in writing only explicitly terms indicating the presence of ambiguities. a relatively
simple case which illustrates what we mean is the following

in the above expression we note that only the rst two terms are potentially am-
biguous. the remaining ones are either logarithmically divergent or nite, both with
unambiguous coecients. of course it is possible to solve all integrals and obtain an
analytical expression for t v ss
. but, for our immediate purposes it is enough to write it
in the form



t v ss


= 2(k2 + k3)[] + nat,

(83)

where nat stands for nonambiguous terms. having this in mind we simply list the other
three point functions in the same manner.

with only one lorentz index we have

t v p p



= 2(k2 + k3)[] + nat,

t sap



= 2i(k1 + k3)[] + nat

on the other hand

and

t aaa

 = 2i(k1 + k2)() + nat

t av v
 = 2i(k1 + k2)() + nat

(84)

(85)

(86)

(87)

which presents ambiguous terms which are identical to those found in t aaa
the more complex ones

the remaining three point functions are all unambiguous although divergent, therefore

are left out of the discussions.

let us now establish contact between our results and those obtained by gerstein and

jackiw showing that it is a simple matter to go from our formalism over to theirs.

5 ambiguities in gerstein and jackiw model

let us now understand how the results obtained in the previous section include those of
ref.[1] as a special case. we show that starting from our expressions we can obtain the
results in tables i and ii for the ambiguities in the two and three point functions as dened
by those authors in section iii of ref.[1]. we start with our results for the amplitude t v s
given by eq.(73) as



t v s
 = 4m(k1 + k2)[].

(90)

in the present notation the ambiguity has been introduced via the arbitrary momenta
k1 and k2, by calculating the amplitudes with internal momenta in the loop: k + k1 and
k + k2 in the two propagators in question, as dened in eq.(6). in ref.[1] the arbitrariness

18

is represented by the momentum s, such that the propagators have momenta k + s and
k + s + p which establish the equivalence relation

in this way the ambiguous part of the amplitude can be cast in the form

k1 = s
k2 = s + p




t v s

 = 4m(2s)(z

4kk

(k2  m2)3 z

d4k
(2)4

g

(k2  m2)2)

(91)

where we have used denitions in eq.(58) . taking now the limit in a symmetric way
in the rst integral, i.e., using the relation

and taking k2  k2  m2 + m2 in this integral we get

lim

(96)

(97)

the functions t v v

 and t aa

 have the same ambiguous part given by

t v v

 |ap = 4k1k2 [  g  g  g] ,

(98)

where  is dened in eq.(56). in this case it is necessary to use the relation

in order to obtain (after some algebra)

t v v
 |ap = t aa

 |ap =

2i2
3(2)4 {s(s + p) + gs  (s + p) + s(s + p)} .

(100)

(101)

(102)

in the case of the three point functions, in order to obtain the results of ref.[1] it
is necessary to take the su(3) indices into account in the calculation of the amplitudes,
since they play an important role in the construction of currents. the gell-mann matrices
introduce symmetry factors such as relative global signs between the direct and crossed
channel, which are not present in our nonabelian model. however this does not introduce
any inconsistency in the two formulations, as we will see.

the arbitrariness in the label for the internal momenta of the loop is introduced by

taking

s = ap + bp

(103)

where a and b are real numbers. the ambiguity is than found by means of calculating the
dierence between two representations for the three point functions: with and without
the arbitrary label s dened above. in this sense we see that it can be interpreted as a
surface term, which would disappear were shifts in the integration variable are allowed.

following this prescription, the ambiguous part of t sap



previously found in the form

t sap



|ap = 2i(k1 + k3)

for the direct channel (without su(3) factors) may be written as

t sap



|ap =

22
(2)4 (ap + bp)

which, after the inclusion of the crossed channel and the pertinent factors yield

t sap



|ap =

22
(2)4 (a  b)(p  p).

20

(104)

(105)

(106)

in a completely analogous way we get

t v ss



|ap = t v p p



|ap =

i22
(2)4 (a  b)(p  p),

t aaa



|ap = t av v



|ap =

22
(2)4 (b  a)(p  p),

(107)

(108)

and nally

t v v v



|ap = t v aa



|ap =

2i2
3(2)4 (b  a) {g(p  p) + g(p  p) + g(p  q)}

(109)

6 ward identities

we next proceed to the verication of the identities given by eqs.(12)-(46) using the free
fermion model. those relations were obtained formally by contracting the lorentz index
of the vertex with the respective external momentum. there are two ways to arrive at
the nal result: rstly, one calculates the greens functions with lower number of points
as those in the function one is investigating. secondly, one can explicitly evaluate the
greens function in question and afterwards contracting the results with the appropriate
external momentum. we will analyze both possibilities for the two point functions and
only the rst one for the three point functions. for this purpose we perform, as before,
only algebraic operations in order to express the four-divergencies in the form of ward
identities.

6.1 one point functions

the rst ward identity to which we refer in section 2 is t v
 . it is a simple matter to check
that in order to obtain eq.(12) we should require (from eq.(55)) the following conditions
to be satised

 = 0
 = 0
 = 0.

(110)

since all terms of t v

 in eq.(55) are ambiguous, requiring relations eqs.(110) rendering
the amplitude as unambiguous and preserving symmetry. as will be shown in what




21

follows it is necessary and sucient to save all other amplitudes from ambiguities and
symmetry violations. there is of course the immediate question for the possibility of an
existing regularization scheme which turns eqs.(110) possible. the answer is positive and
some possibilities are given in ref.[12].

6.2 two point functions

we now study the ward identities for the two point functions. let us, initially, consider
the contraction of t v s

 with the external momentum (k1  k2)

(k1  k2)t v s

 = z

d4k

(2)4 t r(1

1

[k/ + k/1  m]

(k/1  k/2)

1

[k/ + k/2  m]) .

before calculating the trace we use the following identity

(k/1  k/2) = [k/ + k/1  m]  [k/ + k/2  m],

(111)

(112)

so that

(k1  k2)t v s

 = z

d4k

(2)4 t r(1

1

[k/ + k/2  m]) z

d4k

(2)4 t r(1

1

[k/ + k/1  m]) .

(113)

comparing now with eq.(59) we identify two scalar one point greens functions. it is
clear that the vector current will only be conserved if there is no dependence on k1 and
k2 in the one point functions. however, using the result in eq.(61) for t s we get

(k1  k2)t v s

 = 4m(k2k2  k1k1)[].

(114)

apparently, in what concerns possible choices for the k1 and k2 values there is no way the
relation (k1  k2)t v s

 = 0 to be satised.

we can, on the other hand, also check the validity of the identity by the contraction

of (k1  k2) with the expression obtained for t v s

 , eq.(73):

(k1  k2)t v s

 = 4m(k1  k2)(k1 + k2)[].

(115)

in any case the identity can only be satised provided  = 0, which renders t s
zero, as one can check from eq.(61) e eq.(73). let us now study the
 , dened in eq.(71). firstly we do the following

unambiguous and t v s
case of axial-pseudoscalar amplitude t ap



(k1  k2)t ap

 = z

d4k

(2)4 t r(5

1

[k/ + k/2  m]

i(k/1  k/2)5

1

[k/ + k/1  m]) ,

(116)

22

and introduce the identity

(k/1  k/2)5 = [k/ + k/1  m]5 + 5[k/ + k/2  m] + 2m5

(117)

in the interior of the trace, which leads us to

(k1  k2)t ap



= 2mit p p  iz
(2)4 t r(1

iz

d4k

d4k

(2)4 t r(1
[k/ + k/2  m]) .

1

1

[k/ + k/1  m])

(118)

again we see that the verication of the ward identity will crucially depend on values
assumed by the scalar one point function. now it is required that the sum of both do
not depend on k1 and k2. substituting the results previously obtained for the one point
function we obtain

(k1  k2)t ap

 = 2mit p p  2min4iquad(m2) + 2[k1k1 + k2k2]o .

had we, on the other hand, taken eq.(71) and contracting it with (k1  k2), we would

(119)

have gotten

(k1  k2)t ap

 = 4mi(k1  k2)2([ilog(m2)]   i

(4)2! z0(m2, m2, (k1  k2)2; m2)) ,

from which we could get

(k1  k2)t ap



= 2min4[iquad(m2)] + 2(k1  k2)2[ilog(m2)]

   i

(4)2! (k1  k2)22z0(m2, m2, (k1  k2)2; m2)

2(k1k1 + k2k2)}

(120)

(121)

2min4[iquad(m2)] + 2(k1k1 + k2k2)o

this results agrees with eq.(101) provided we identify, in the rst term, in curly brack-
ets, the expression for t p p , as we can see from eq.(70). the ward identity in eq.(16),
apparently, will be violated by ambiguous contributions.

let us next take the amplitude t av

 which has two lorentz indices and has two ward
identities connected to it, one for the vector index and other for the axial one. for the
vector current we have

(k1  k2)t av

d4k

(2)4 t r(i5
 = z
(2)4 t r(i5
z

[k/ + k/2  m])
[k/ + k/1  m]) ,

d4k

1

1

(122)

23

where we immediately identify the one point axial functions which vanish identically and
therefore (k1  k2)t av

 = 0. doing the same for the axial current we have

(k1  k2)t av

 = 2mi[t p v



] z

d4k

(2)4 t r(i5

1

[k/ + k/2  m])

z

d4k

(2)4 t r(i5

1

[k/ + k/1  m]) ,

so that

(k1  k2)t av

 = 2mi[t p v



].

(123)

(124)

yields the expected result for the ward identity in eq.(17). however the amplitude t p v
is identically zero given dirac trace properties, which immediatly implies with t av
 = 0.
checking now with eq.(74) we see that the result obtained for the identity using explicit
expression for the amplitude and then eecting the contraction forces that  = 0. only
in this case consistency is restored. if we take the four-divergence directly from eq.(74) it
is easy see that (k1  k2)t av

 = 0 and (k1  k2)t av

 = 0.



the case of the amplitude t v v


is analogous. if we rst perform the contraction

(k1  k2)t v v

1

d4k

(2)4 t r(
 = z
(2)4 t r(
z

[k/ + k/2  m])
[k/ + k/1  m]) ,

d4k

1

(125)

we again see that the result will depend on the one point function. substituting now for
their expressions we get

(k1  k2)t v v

 = 4(()k2

k1k1k1

k2

1k1 + k1k1k1) .

(126)

the conservation of the vector current demands, therefore that the r.h.s. be identically
null, which cannot be obtained by any choice of k1 and k2. it is easy to check that the

24

same result would have been obtained if we had taken the four divergence directly on the
nal result for t v v
 , eq.(82), since the unambiguous term of the latter is gauge invariant.
this shows that in order to satisfy the ward identities relative to the t v v
 amplitude we
need to require the same conditions as for the one point function, eq.(92).

last we turn to t aa

this allows us to relate them to the amplitudes t ap
with the external momentum. thus, upon contracting with (k1  k2) we get

 . associated to this greens function we have two axial currents.
and t p p by successive contractions



(k1  k2)t aa

(127)

(128)

therefore it is veried that the conditions under which the ward identities are satised
are the same as the previous ones. in order to obtain the identity from eq.(20) it is enough
to contract, once more, with the index .

6.3 three point functions

we next turn to the question of the verication of ward identities related to the three
point functions. we will use only the rst way, i.e., by relating the contracted functions
with two-point functions, following gerstein and jackiw [1].

let us consider the identity for the amplitude t v ss



(k3  k2)t v ss



= z

d4k

(2)4 t r(1

1

[k/ + k/1  m]

1

1

[k/ + k/2  m]

(k/3  k/2)

1

[k/ + k/3  m])

(129)

25

which can be written in the form

(k3  k2)t v ss



d4k

(2)4 t r(1
= z
(2)4 t r(1
z

d4k

1

1

1

[k/ + k/2  m])
[k/ + k/3  m]) ,

1

1

[k/ + k/1  m]

1

[k/ + k/1  m]

(130)

where one can identify the scalar two-point function i.e.,

(k3  k2)t v ss



(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m) = t ss(k1, m; k2, m)  t ss(k1, m; k3, m).

(131)

looking at eq.(69) we verify that the amplitude t ss possesses unambiguous terms, i.e.,
terms which depends on dierences (k1  k2)2 and (k1  k3)2 which are the external
momenta p2 and p2 respectively. explicitly the dierence in eq.(13) can be put into the
form

(k3  k2)t v ss



(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m) =

2((4m2  p2)"ilog(m2)   i
 (4m2  p2)"ilog(m2)   i

(4)2! z0(m2, m2, p2; m2)#
(4)2! z0(m2, m2, p2; m2)#)

+2(k2k2  k3k3).

(132)

now we need to include the crossed channel. redening adequately the momenta of the
external lines and operating in a analogous way we nally arrive at

(l3  l2)t v ss



(l1, m; l2, m; l3, m) =

2((4m2  p2)"ilog(m2)   i
 (4m2  p2)"ilog(m2)   i

(4)2! z0(m2, m2, p2; m2)#
(4)2! z0(m2, m2, p2; m2)#)

+2(l2l2  l3l3).

(133)

the sum of the contributions of the two channels yield the following expression for the
searched ward identity

qt v ss



= 2(k2k2  k3k3) + 2(l2l2  l3l3).

(134)

this result shows that the conservation of the vector current depends in this case on the
dierence . this condition has already been found previously.

26

for the amplitude t v p p



we nd

qt v p p



= 2(k3k3  k2k2) + 2(l3l3  l2l2).

(135)

still with one lorentz index we have the process a  sp for which we write

(k3  k2)t asp



= z

d4k

(2)4 t r(1

1

[k/ + k/1  m]

5

1

[k/ + k/2  m]

i(k/3  k/2)

1

[k/ + k/3  m]) .

(136)

again, making use of the identity

(k/2  k/3)5 = 5[k/ + k/3  m] + [k/ + k/2  m]5 + 2m5,

(137)

with which we can verify on the r.h.s. the two point functions t p p and t ss, besides
t p sp . substituting the results for them with inclusion of the crossed channel, we have

qt asp



= 2mi[t p sp ]  2(k3k3  k2k2)  2(l3l3  l2l2),

(138)

where the identity violating term is again associated with ambiguities.

the cases with two lorentz indices are now in order. making use of the two point

functions t v s

 , for t sv v

 we get for the two associated ward identities

and

pt sv v



= 4m(k3  k1) + 4m(l3  l1)

= 4m(p + p),

t sv v
p



= 4m(k1  k2) + 4m(l1  l2)

= 4m(p + p).

(139)

(140)

in this results it is important to note an unambiguous character for the violation term.
this means that the identity depends on the value of  and this is not associated with
ambiguities here.

for the s  aa process, which has two related axial currents we get

pt saa



= 2mi[t sp a



]  4m(k1 + k3)  4m(l1 + l3)

(141)

and

t saa
p



= 2mi[t sap



]  4m(k1 + k2)  4m(l1 + l2),

(142)

27

which are violated by  with ambiguous coecients.

let us now look at the process v  ap .

identity is expressed in terms of the two point functions t ap
upon inclusion of the crossed channel we promptly obtain

in the case of the vector current, the
 which are unambiguous.

qt v ap



= 0.

(143)

on the other hand, the identity related to the axial current yields

pt v ap



= 2mi[t v p p



]  4m(k2 + k3)  4m(l2 + l3).

(144)

we are now left with the amplitudes with three lorentz indices. in the case of t v v v


the identities are expressed in terms of the two point functions t v v

 and we obtain

qt v v v



pt v v v



= 4 [k1(k2  k3) + l1(l2  l3)] [  g  g  g] ,

= 4 [k2(k1  k3) + l3(l2  l1)] [  g  g  g]

all three are totally ambiguous and expressed in terms of  and .

in the case of the t v aa



amplitude we have analogous results: for the vector current

we nd

qt v aa



= 4 [k1(k2  k3) + l1(l2  l3)] [  g  g  g]

(153)

and for the axial currents

let us now consider the amplitude t av v

associated to the index . contracting with the corresponding external momentum, after
substituting the two point functions t av

+4 [(l3l1 + l1l2) + (l1l3 + l2l1)] .

(156)

in the same way for the vector currents we arrive at

pt av v



= 4 [k2(k1  k3) + k2(k1  k3)]

4 [l3(l1  l2) + l3(l1  l2)]

(158)

we nally repeat the procedure for the three ward identities associated to t aaa

this case, the contraction with the external momenta give rise to the two point functions
t av

7 final analysis

we have established the ward identities, for fermions with spin 1/2 and equal masses
to be satised by one, two and three point functions. we next explicitly calculated the
one and two point functions and the ambiguous terms for the three point functions. the
corresponding amplitudes, whose supercial degree of divergence, are cubic, quadratic or
linear are shown to be potentially ambiguous. the ward identities which relate these
amplitudes could then be violated.

in order to perform the calculations we followed a simple strategy concerning the
divergencies; instead of adopting a specic regularization we simply have used general

30

properties of an eventual regulating function whose momentum dependence should be
even and a connection limit should exist. therefore, in our results, are still contained
those results corresponding to specic regularizations as we have shown. the conditions
under which all the ambiguities can be avoided involve, in 4-d, the following objects:

the divergent part of the nal results are expressed in terms of the three above rela-
tions plus ilog(m2) and iquad(m2). in d.r. this objects can be obtained simultaneously as
zero.

in the present context, the analysis of the results, regarding the ambiguities and
symmetry relations, resulted rather transparent, once we look all conditions through the
three forms above. concerning this two aspects we can state what follows:

 ambiguities

in all amplitudes the dependence upon arbitrary choice of internal momenta of
loops appear simply as coecients for the dierences between divergent integrals,
eqs.(162)-(164). given this fact the conclusion is immediate: all the ambiguities
will be eliminated if they are simultaneously zero. howeverit is not surprising that
ambiguities can be eliminated if shifts were allowed i.e., provided we ignore the
corresponding surface terms. conversely, from this point of view, this conclusion can
be looked upon as 4-d conditions to be satised by any regularization prescription
which should have the consistency of d.r. whenever it applies [12]. however this is
not the whole story.

 ward identities

in our investigations we have found several examples in which ambiguities and
symmetry violations are intimately connected and have the same origin. however

31

there were also several instances in which ward identities could be violated by
unambiguous terms with the same structure of the relations eqs.(162)-(164). this
is the case, for example, of t v v
 where the dierence  appears with an
unambiguous coecient. also the three point functions t sv v
involve the
dierence  as condition for the fulllment of the w.i. the dierence  would
also appears as an unambiguous contribution for the four point function t v v v v
as
can be easily checked.

we could then invert the analysis starting precisely by these amplitudes and extracting
the conclusion that, independently of ambiguities, the objects ,  and  should
be obtained as zero. we would then, a posteriori, verify that these conditions eliminate
all sources of ambiguities.

at this point we reach an important and rather surprising result: following the stra-
tegy of gerstein and jackiw in ref.[1] to study w.i., which has been used historically
to establish violations of symmetry relations, we found a set of conditions which allow
all the w.i. to be satised. in this context the possibility of making use of ambiguities
for any purpose is automatically eliminated. by imposing these referred conditions, the
corresponding results of d.r. can be immediately mapped whenever it applies. those
corresponding gerstein and jackiw results, as we have shown in section 5, can be equally
obtained from our results but not with the same interpretation for the objects  , 
and .

the situation is now the following: to establish or justify the existence of the anomaly
phenomena, in the context of perturbative calculations, we need use a specic prescription
to evaluate some divergent integrals. the traditional one, based on surface terms, could
be used, in principle, to treat all the amplitudes for any theories but is discarded where
the d.r. can be applied and accepted only for the treatment of pseudo-amplitudes where
the d.r. cannot be used due its natural limitation. the two treatments lead to results
that cannot be mapped one into another for places where both are applied.

if we are looking for an universal way to treat all divergent amplitudes in qft, the

above situation in unacceptable.

we arrive at two deeply dierent options: rst if we adopt the interpretation corre-
sponding the surface terms point of view we can get a picture for triangular anomalies
that correspond to the one of the gerstein an jackiw, but, in consequence, we will plague
all physical amplitudes with ambiguities and we loose the translational invariance, the
main of the basics space-time symmetries, second if we adopt the d.r. interpretation for

32

the objects ,  and  we have all symmetry relations satised, including those
considered as anomalous.

this statement is an immediate consequence of our strategy in looking for perturbative
calculations involving divergent amplitudes; the consistency conditions makes immaterial
an eventual choice for the value of undened quantities, because in all places of ocur-
rence they are multiplied by dierences between divergent integrals of the same degree of
divergence, that are identically zero.

once we have concluded that there is no chance of consistency in calculations involving
divergent integrals without the imposition of consistent conditions, a crucial question
emerges: the combination of our treatment given to the divergent integral plus the strategy
of gerstein and jackiw to verify ward identities in three point functions leads to the
conclusion that there are no anomalies in triangular diagrams? the answer is no. the
conclusion of our investigation, which at this point became transparent, is that this kind
of analysis is not consistent, because we can nd conditions that produce exactly the
opposite conclusion of initial intentions.

what is then the correct procedure to discuss this problem? our expectative resides
on the explicitly calculations for the three point functions. the correct violation values
for symmetry relations (anomalies) need to emerge in a natural way, free of ambiguities
related to the arbitrary choice of internal labels. this is actually the essential point of the
sutherland paradox that states the impossibility to obtain simultaneously the three ward
identities and the correct value in zero external momenta. in a calculation where one of
these ingredients is absent we cannot extract conclusions about the anomaly phenomena.
work along these lines is presently under way and the preliminary results are in perfect
agreement with the above arguments.
