in models inspired by non-commutative geometry, patterns of gauge symmetry breaking
are analyzed, and su (5) models are found to favor a vacuum preserving su (3)c su (2)w 
u (1)y naturally. a setup for a more realistic model is presented, and a possibility of d-brane
interpretation is discussed.

1.

introduction

there have been many attempts to study the origin of higgs mechanism. among
them a method using an idea of non-commutative geometry (ncg) 1) was pro-
posed 2), where it was shown that the weinberg-salam model can be reconstructed
naturally from its viewpoint. the point of this formulation is to extend the denition
of (gauge) connection so as to be applicable to some non-commutative space, where
the higgs elds are supplied as a connection of that discrete space. an intriguing
feature is that the higgs elds naturally develop non-zero vacuum expectation values
(vevs) and break the gauge symmetry.

the methods of ncg presented by connes et al. was purely mathematical,
therefore it is of great interest to use their systematic approach in various systems
of physics. g. konisi et al. 3) proposed a simplied framework for computing higgs
potential and yukawa interaction terms, derived from gauge kinematics on a cer-
tain disconnected submanifold (this base space is called m4  zn , where m4 is the
minkowski space-time). some phenomenological models have been constructed along
this line. 3), 4), 5) this framework gives a clear understanding of the higgs elds as
connection elds, and possesses fewer free parameters compared to ncg. actually,
in usual ncg, the direction of the gauge symmetry breaking can be put by hand.

in this paper, utilizing the fact that the method proposed in ref. 3) has fewer
parameters, we analyze the breaking patterns of gauge symmetries in some models.
after featuring the breaking patterns of a few models, we show that a simple su (5)
model with an adjoint higgs eld prefers a vacuum which preserves the standard
model gauge group, su (3)c  su (2)w  u (1)y . then it is shown to be possible
to obtain also the electro-weak symmetry breaking under an assumption for the
coecients of the higgs potential.
in the nal section we discuss a possibility to
regard the minkowski spaces separated with each other as d-branes.

according to ref. 3), the potential for the higgs elds associated with the trans-

lation in the directions in the discrete space is given as

v =

1

4xp xk,h

p,kh tr(cid:16)fkh(x, p)f kh(x, p)(cid:17) ,

(2.1)

where k and h denote the directions of the translation in zn , and p is an element
of zn . a real constant p,kh is a normalization parameter. the eld strengths are
dened by use of higgs elds h as

fkh(x, p)  h(x, p, p+k+h)  h(x, p, p+k)h(x, p+k, p+k+h) .

(2.2)

the simplest example is the case with a discrete space z2. we can assign gauge
symmetries on each element of z2, and generally they are su (n ) and su (m ) (n 
m ). then, the only one higgs eld h a
in the (n, m) representation appears and
i
forms the following potential

the index k (k1) means the translation from n to m (m to n ). when the
constants n and m are positive, the vacuum minimizing this potential preserves a
gauge symmetry su (nm )  u (1)m 1.

fig. 1. the adjoint higgs eld is realized as a connection on discrete space.

in some cases, it is eective to identify some of the vector spaces v (acted by the
gauge rotation) on the elements of the discrete space, in order to obtain phenomeno-
logical models. for a study, let us identify the two in the previous setup (therefore
take n equal to m ). the higgs eld  is then in the adjoint representation, and
the higgs potential follows as

v =

(cid:16)n  2 tr 2 + tr 4(cid:17) .

(2.4)

referring to the result of ref. 6), the vacuum of the potential (2.4) breaks the gauge
symmetry su (n ) down to su (n  n)  su (n)  u (1), where n is the greatest
integer not larger than n/2.

3. su (5) model

a fascinating feature of the su (n ) model (2.4) is that in the case n = 5 we
obtain the standard model gauge symmetry, su (3)  su (2)  u (1). the gauge
group su (5) is one of the candidates for grand unication, and the adjoint higgs 
is just the one needed for the symmetry breaking in the su (5) gut.

in the usual minimal su (5) gut, one introduces a ve dimensional higgs eld h
in order to acquire the electro-weak symmetry breaking, as well as . in the context
of ref. 3), this matter content is supplied by adopting a space-time m4  z3, which
is visually shown in fig. 2. vector spaces are assigned as follows: v (c5) on m (1)
4 ,
and v (r1) on m (3)
v (c5) on m (2)
4 . we have assumed that the vector spaces on
4
m (1)
and m (2)
are the same as before. hence the ve dimensional higgs elds h
which connect two m4s as m (1)

are the same.

here the indices h, k, l denote the directions of the translation (see fig. 3). note
that we have two scale parameters dl and dk, the distance between two minkowski
spaces (another parameter dh is equal to dk because of the identication). since
the higgs elds in the denition (2.2) are dimensionless, we shall associate them

 though fermions and their interaction terms can be introduced as in ref. 7), we shall con-

centrate on the higgs potential in this paper.

 the gauge elds on m (1)

are also the same. the gauge eld on m (3)

appear, since we put a real vector space on it. thus the gauge group is only the su (5).

with the length of the translation: eh(x, p, p+k)  h(x, p, p+k)/dk. moreover, the
higgs potential should have dimension four, hence we put a naive assumption for
the normalization parameter p,kh = ap,kh/(d2
h), where ap,kh is a dimensionless
parameter expected to be of order 1. so as to get the hierarchical structure of the
vevs of the higgs elds, we assume   d2

v1 = 2b1(cid:16)5  2 tr(2) + tr(4)(cid:17) , v2 = 2(b2 + b3)(h h  2h h + h 2h) ,
v3 = b4(cid:16)tr(2)  2h h + (h h)2(cid:17) + (b5 + b6)(1  h h)2 + 4b5 .

 the potential (3.2) is dierent from the one obtained in ref. 4). the latter was given through

(3.3)

another conguration of vector spaces on m4  z3:

v =

though the authors of ref. 4) introduced ve arbitrary parameters a, , e, let us associate these
with the distances between the minkowski spaces plausibly, in order to give an appropriate dimension

therefore, this model has no realistic vacuum if the coecients of the potential is put in the way
above.

here we have used relations for the coecients coming from the identication:

a1,l1l = a2,ll1  b1 ,
a3,kl = a3,h1l1  b3 ,
a1,hh1 = a2,k1k  b5 ,

a1,l1k1 = a2,lh  b2 ,
a1,hk = a2,k1h1  b4 ,
a3,h1h = a3,kk1  b6 .

(3.4)

as for the adjoint higgs, the (tr 2)2 term which would be phenomenologically
acceptable does not appear in the potentail. this is characteristic in our model due
to the structure of the eld strength (3.1).

to investigate this potential, it is useful to write the vev of h explicitly as
(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5), and put hi = diag(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5). this is possible with the use
of the su (5) rotation. when solving the stationary condition for v, the constraint
tr  = 0 should be taken into account. thus we add to the above v a term p pi,
where  is a lagrange multiplier. then, the necessary conditions for minimizing the
potential v are,
|hj|2 + (b5 +b6)(cid:21) = 0
v
hi

= 0  (b2 +b3)(1  p2

the pattern of the symmetry breaking of our interest is required to have a hierarchal

structure. thus we add a constraint e  eh, or in other words,

o(pi)  o(hi) .

the vacuum should satisfy the equations (3.5)(3.8).

(3.8)

a natural values of the coecients are b1 = b2 = b3 = b4 = b5 = b6 = 1. but adopting
these values, it turns out that the potential v is minimized at hhi = 0, hence
unfortunately, the electro-weak breaking does not occur. this is mainly because of
the hierarchical structure of the potential (3.2). the global structure is given by the
part v1 (this leads us to the gut breaking), and the next order term v2 determines
the breaking pattern for h. as seen from the form of the potential (3.3), v2 is
bilinear in h and therefore gives hhi = 0 (or if the coecient in front of h h is
negative, it gives a large hhi together with v3, and the hypothesis of the hierarchy
for vevs is violated).
therefore, instead, let us assume a relation b2 + b3 = 0. then putting b1 = b4 =
b5 = b6 = 1 for simplicity, a straightforward calculation shows that the whole potential
v is minimized at

hi =

diag(2,2,2, 3, 3) ,

in this way, we obtain a hierarchical structure of the gauge symmetry breaking of a
su (5) gut, su (5)  su (3)c  su (2)w  u (1)y  su (3)c  u (1)em.

4. discussion

in this paper, we have studied the patterns of the gauge symmetry breaking in
models constructed along the proposal of ref. 3). applying the proposal to a simple
su (5) model with an adjoint higgs eld, the obtained breaking pattern is found
to be very preferable phenomenologically, su (5)  su (3)c  su (2)w  u (1)y.
then this model has been extended so as to include a ve dimensional higgs eld
for electro-weak symmetry breaking. this is available by adding another minkowski
space, and under the assumption for the coecients of the potential, the vacuum
breaks the gauge symmetry down to su (3)cu (1)em with a hierarchical structure.
though the connection higgs formalism seems to be a nice idea to realize and
explain the higgs mechanism, it suers a problem of renormalizability. actually,
this formalism brings about coupling reduction, and in general it is impossible to
renormalize the obtained higgs potential. one way to get rid of this diculty is to
regard the couplings in the higgs potential as a one at a certain energy scale, i.e.
renormalization point. 9) but then, what this energy scale represents? a possible
story 10) is to think of the minkowski spaces separated with each other as d-branes,
and the energy scale as the string scale. in string phenomenology, the appearance
of d-branes have exploited new methods for model construction, where our four
dimensional space-time is realized as a worldvolume of the d-brane. 11)

if we regard three parallel minkowski spaces as d-branes, then the identication
taken in this paper and many other models in ncg becomes very natural. the
situation of fig. 3 can be translated into a conguration of string theory as follows:
consider coincident 5 d3-branes (blobs in fig. 3) and a parallel orbifold singular
surface (gray line) located apart from those d3-branes. the gauge group on the
d-branes is su (5). (a gauge group so(10) is obtained when the location of the
orbifold singular surface coincides with the one of d3-branes.) the higgs eld 
can be regarded as a sort of wilson line, 13) since it is a translational operator. the
path generating a non-trivial wilson line is the same as a conguration of a dirichlet
open string in a twisted sector. a scale of this system is the distance dl/2 between
the d-branes and the orbifold singularity. another minkowski space m (3)
(a circle)
is a single d-brane on the orbifold singular surface. the scale for symmetry breaking
is determined by the distance between d-branes.

4

although on the above points d-branes provide a natural interpretation of the
conguration of this paper, d-branes are in themselves supersymmetric objects. in
the context of ref. 3) and ncg, it is dicult to incorporate n = 1 supersym-
metry. 14) therefore relations between the string theory and ncg should be more
claried (see a related discussion in ref. 15)) for understanding of the gauge symme-

 minimal su (5) guts in the context of ncg 7), 8) are completely dierent from ours.
 we have not considered radiative corrections in this paper.
 similar situation can be found in ref. 12) in string theory side.
