abstract

in this note we construct a new class of superconformal eld theo-
ries as mass deformed n = 4 super yang-mills theories. we will argue
that these theories correspond to the xed points which were recently
found [1] studying the deformations of the dual iib string theory on
ads5  s 5.

1 introduction

the investigation of superconformal eld theories has already a long history.
one appealing feature of superconformal models is that they often exhibit a
strong-weak coupling duality symmetry (s-duality). in a remarkable recent
development it became clear that in a large class of superconformal eld the-
ories a new type of duality symmetry arises, namely they can be equivalently
described by supergravity in anti-de-sitter (ads) spaces [2]. in particular,
there is a correspondence between four-dimensional superconformal eld the-
ories and supergravity on ads5  m 5, where m 5 is a certain ve-dimensional
einstein space. in the simplest case, m 5 is given by s 5, and the correspond-
ing superconformal eld theory is just n = 4 super yang-mills with su(n)
gauge symmetry. this is nothing else as the superconformal theory which
lives on the world volume of n parallel d3 branes. another well studied ex-
ample for m 5 is the coset space t 1,1 which leads to a n = 1 superconformal
gauge theory, which is the celebrated superconformal theory of d3 branes
probing a conifold singularity [3].

the prescription [4, 5, 6, 7] of the holographic map allows for several non-
trivial checks of the conjectured ads/cft correspondence. for example, the
central charge of the conformal eld theory is inversely proportional to the
volume of m 5. this check works very nicely for the correspondence between
the coset space t 1,1 and the superconformal eld theory from d3 branes at
the conifold singularity. recently, deformations of the usual iib string theory
on ads5  s 5 has been studied [8, 9, 1] by analyzing critical points of n = 8
gauged supergravity.
in [1] a new xed point was found, leaving n = 2
unbroken in the bulk (corresponding to n = 1 on the brane). the infor-
mation about this xed point that has been extracted from the supergravity
description are the global symmetries and the ratio of the central charges of
the undeformed uv theory and the interacting ir theory: cir/cu v = 27/32.
the aim of this letter is to show that this new xed point corresponds to
a particular mass deformation of the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory. we
will show that our new xed point eld theories obtained by mass deforming
the n = 4 theory indeed reproduce the global symmetry as well as the ratio
cir/cu v from the supergravity side.

in section 2 we will rst briey review the method [10] of deforming
a supersymmetric eld theory with a marginal operator to obtain a new
class of superconformal models. then we recall the existence of a family of
n = 1 superconformal theories as mass deformed n = 2 theories. deforming

2

the nite n = 2 su(n) theory with 2n avors by a mass for the adjoint
chiral multiplet leaves an n = 1 theory with a quartic superpotential. by
the method of [10] it can be established that this quartic superpotential
is a marginal deformation of the ir physics. the superconformal theory
along the xed line parametrized by the marginal operator is precisely the
superconformal theory of n d3 branes probing a conifold.

then we will argue that the same arguments will basically establish that
deforming the n = 4 susy gauge theory by a mass term to one of the adjoint
chiral multiplets will lead to a one parameter family of n = 1 superconformal
theories. they can be expressed as n = 1 theories with two massless adjoints
a and b deformed by a quartic superpotential w  (ab)2. this has to be
contrasted with the mass deformation of the n = 4 theories by a mass for
a full hypermultiplet studied e.g. in [11]. while latter one leaves an n = 2
theory, our deformation leaves only n = 1 unbroken.

in section 3 we will turn to the dual supergravity description provided
by the supersymmetric xed point found in [1] from the deformation of the
ads5  s 5 supergravity. while the eld theory considerations presented up
to this point are actually valid for an arbitrary gauge group, only the su(n)
theories will be realized on d3 branes probes in iib4.

2 the new conformal theories

let us rst briey recall the construction of [10] to establish the existence
of a family of new n = 1 superconformal theories by mass deforming a
given superconformal theory. the mass deformation causes a ow from the
original theory in the uv to the deformed theory in the ir. specically,
start with a theory at a xed point with a marginal operator provided by
the superpotential

w = gx,

and add the following mass term to the superpotential

wmass = mx 2.

4allowing for orientifolds, the so and sp examples are also accessible.

via its equation of motion the heavy eld can be integrated out, and one
obtains the new, non-renormalizable superpotential

wnew = 

g2
2m

()2.

(3)

as shown in [10] this is again a marginal operator.

2.1 the ow from nite n = 2 theories to supercon-

formal n = 1 theories

in this section be briey recall how this method establishes the existence and
s-duality of a family of n = 1 superconformal theories as mass deformed
nite n = 2 theories. in the simplest case the n = 2 theory is su(n) gauge
theory with n fundamental hypermultiplets, whose -function is zero.
in
n = 1 language the superpotential has the form

w = gq qx,

(4)

where x is an adjoint scalar multiplet and the 2n fundamental elds q and q
originate from the hypermultiplets. now giving mass to x via wmass = mx 2
breaks the supersymmetry to n = 1 with, after integrating out x, the
marginal operator

wnew = h(q q)2,

h =

g2
2m

.

(5)

as discussed in [10] there is a second way to ow to the curve parametrized
by this operator. they consider supersymmetric quantum chromesodynamics
(sqcmd), that is su(n) gauge theory with 2n avors, a singlet meson eld
n and:

w = nq q +

m0
2

n 2.

again there is the marginal operator5 (q q)2, since gauge  (n  nq)  
and hence vanishing of the  functions only imposes one constraint on the

5keeping track of the index structure the second term in the superpotential should
similarly the (q q)2 operator will read
s ). here and in the rest of the paper we will use the

g , translates directly into a n = 1 s-duality, h 

one interesting point is that the s-duality of the nite n = 2 theory,
g 
h , on the xed
line parametrized by h. the special point where this operator is turned
o corresponds to n = 1 with no superpotential. in sqcmd this can be
achieved at m0 = , in n = 2 by g = 0. at this point the global symmetry
is enhanced. in sqcmd there is another special point with this enhanced
symmetry, m0 = 0. here we have seibergs dual su(n) with 2n avors and
w = nq q. in the n = 2 language this corresponds to the free magnetic
theory at g = . therefore the n = 2 s-duality means from the n = 1
point of view that the theory is selfdual under seiberg duality.

this type of n = 1 gauge theory with gauge group su(n)  su(n),
bifundamental chiral matter elds and with quartic superpotential precisely
appears as the superconformal theory living on n d3 branes probing a coni-
fold, respectively as the dual supergravity on ads5  t 1,1 (t 1,1 = (su(2) 
su(2))/u(1)). in a t-dual brane picture [13] `a la hanany-witten [14], the
mass deformations corresponds to the rotation of one of the two ns branes
by a certain angle. on the other hand, the ow from n = 2 to n = 1 cor-
responds in the supergravity context to deforming the n = 2 orbifold space
s 5/z2 by a blow up to the coset space t 1,1.

2.2 the ow from n = 4 theories to superconformal

n = 1 theories

by the same reasoning as in the nite n = 2 case we can also study the
n = 4 theory. this is really just a special case of a nite n = 2 theory. the
matter content is just one adjoint hypermultiplet. so the analysis from above
applies to this case as well. this has however some interesting implications.
so let us spell out this result that is implicit in the analysis of [10].

from the n = 1 point of view, the n = 4 theory provides us three adjoint
chiral elds a, b and x. the superpotential is just the cubic expression
w = gf abcaabbxc. now we add the mass term for the chiral eld x. as a
result we get that any n = 1 theory with two adjoint matter elds a and b
allows for a marginal deformation by adding the quartic superpotential

w =

g2
2m

f abcf decaabbadbe.

not all values of this marginal coupling are distinct. there exists an s-duality
inherited from the n = 4 theory, mapping strong coupling to weak coupling.
looking at the special point where the quartic superpotential is turned o,
we nd the interesting conclusion that all n = 1 theories with 2 adjoints are
selfdual under seiberg duality in the sense that electric and magnetic theory
have the same gauge group, but the magnetic theory has in addition a cubic
superpotential coupling to some singlet meson elds.
let us add a few comments about this model:

(i) the self-duality under seiberg duality is not in apparent conict with the
models with two adjoints discussed by [15] where always an ade-type of
superpotential is present.

(ii) as is in the previous case we can reach the marginal operator eq.(6) also
from a sqcmd with four singlet meson elds coupled to the two adjoint
elds a and b.

(iii) this deformation is not the same as the deformation of the n = 4 theory
by a mass term for a full hypermultiplet as e.g. studied in [11]. latter one
leaves an n = 2 susy unbroken and mass deformation is given by one
complex parameter. in our case it is just one real mass parameter.

(iv) as in the previous case of deforming n = 2 models there will be again
a description in terms of deformed brane congurations, now in terms of
a brane box.
in contrast to the realization of the mass deformed n = 4
theory on the interval studied by [12] where one gives a complex mass to a
hypermultiplet leaving n = 2 unbroken, the brane box naturally give the
possibility to incorporate a real mass for a chiral multiplet (breaking down
to n = 1) by a very similar mechanism. a more detailed description of this
duality will be given in [16].

3 the dual supergravity description

following the ideas of [2] one would expect these conformal eld theories to
have a dual supergravity description. since the eld theory arises as a mass
deformation of n = 4 sym, the dual supergravity description should be a
deformation of the usual iib string theory on ads5  s 5. in [8, 9, 1] such
deformations where studied by analyzing critical points of n = 8 gauged
supergravity. in [1] a new xed point was found, leaving n = 2 unbroken

6

in the bulk (corresponding to n = 1 on the brane). we will argue that
this deformation indeed corresponds to the dual of the superconformal eld
theories we were studying in this paper.

as a rst piece of evidence for our identication of the conformal n = 1
theory obtained by mass deforming the n = 4 theory with the sugra
solution of [1] let us compare the global symmetries. according to [1] the
subgroup of so(5) unbroken by the solution is su(2)  u(1). the su(2)
in the eld theory rotates the 2 adjoints into each other. the abab super
potential is invariant. the u(1) is the u(1)r symmetry of the n = 1 theory
under which a and b both have charge 1/2.

a more quantitative test is to compare the ratio of the central charges c
of the undeformed uv and the deformed ir theory. the uv central charge
will be given just by the free eld contributions. the central charge of the ir
conformal theory can be calculated from the anomaly of the r-charge, since
they sit in the same supermultiplet. this calculation can be found in great
detail e.g. in [7].

on the supergravity side the ratio can be calculated by comparing the
volume of the undeformed sugra solution with that of the deformed. the
prediction is 27/32. let us show that this value is reproduced by our proposed
dual eld theory.

as in [7] we calculate the central charge c and the axial charge a comput-
ing the correlators among the energy momentum tensor t and the r-current
r:

 < t t r >  a  c

and, with the same proportionality factor,

 < rrr >  5a  3c.

(8)

first consider the uv theory. the uv theory is the unbroken n = 4
theory. it has c = 1/4  (n 2
 1). to see this use the above relations. we
c
have (n 2
 1) matter fermions with
c
r = 1/3 (the superpotential has to have r = 2, so the scalars have r = 2/3
and the fermions r = 1/3).

in the ir we see the mass deformed n = 1 theory, so w = abx + x 2

produces w = (ab)2, and we are left with (n 2

(13)

(14)

comparing with above we nd cir/cu v = 27/32 as predicted by super-
gravity! it would be interesting to compare also the chiral spectrum of the
superconformal eld theory with the spectrum of the scalar laplacian of the
deformed s 5 manifold.

note that the numerical value 27/32 is precisely the same as the one
obtained in the related setup of the conifold as viewed as a mass deformation
of the z2 orbifold [7, 12]. this lead [1] to the speculation that these two
theories are indeed related. here we see that they are quite distinct. the

8

reason for the matching of the numerical values is just due to the mechanism
by which we deform: a nite theory with a cubic superpotential (the only
choice in a nite theory) is deformed by a mass term, giving rise to quartic
superpotential while killing 1/3 of the elds. the superpotential uniquely
xes the r-charge which in turn determines the central charge.

having identied the deformation of [1] leading to an n = 1 superconfor-
mal eld theory in the dual language, one might hope that we can understand
the deformations leading to the n = 0 theories in a similar spirit.
