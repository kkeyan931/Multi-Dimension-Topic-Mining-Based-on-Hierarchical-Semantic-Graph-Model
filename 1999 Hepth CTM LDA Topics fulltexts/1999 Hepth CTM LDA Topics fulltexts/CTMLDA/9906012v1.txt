abstract

we consider d3 branes at orbifolded conifold singularities which are not quotient
singularities. we use toric geometry and gauged linear sigma model to study the moduli
space of the gauge theories on the d3 branes. we nd that topologically distinct phases
are related by a op transition. it is also shown that an orbifold singularity can occur
in some phases if we give expectation values to some of the chiral elds.

1 introduction

last years have witnessed great insights into understanding of supersymmetric gauge
theory and supergravity theory. we now found that these are complementary descrip-
tions of a single theory on solitonic brane solutions of m theory and string theory. con-
gurations containing ns vebranes and d branes in string theory are tools for studying
supersymmetric gauge eld theory in various dimensions with dierent supersymmetries
(see [5] for a complete set of references up to february 1998).

on the other hand, maldacenas conjecture proposes that m or string theory on the
adspsk, with n units of supergravity k-form eld through sk is dual to a p1 specic
conformal eld on the boundary of the adsp space [6] (see [7] for an extensive review
and a complete set of references). the initial proposal gave conformal eld theories with
maximal supersymmetry, n = 4 in four dimensions. this was obtained by studying d3-
branes in at space. an immediate generalization to d3-branes at orbifold singularities
breaks more supersymmetry [8, 9].

another important class is obtained by studying d3-branes at non-orbifold singular-
ities like conifold singularity. the conifold singularity has been analyzed in [22] where
an infrared theory on the worldvolume of d3 branes was proposed. other results for the
case of non-orbifold singularities and their connection to eld theories in three and four
dimensions have been obtained in [1, 2, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].

in [1, 2], the authors have exploited the fact that the conifold singularity is dual to
a system of perpendicular ns5 vebranes intersecting over a 3+1 dimensional world-
volume. their result was generalized in [29, 30] for more general conifolds. a duality
between d3 branes on these general conifolds and congurations of ns and d4 branes
was proposed together with relation between dierent resolutions of the singularity and
displacements of ns branes. in [30], a mirror symmetry was proposed between orbifolded
conifolds and generalized conifolds.

in the present paper we consider branes at orbifolded conifolds ckl which is an orb-
ifold of the three dimensional conifold xy  uv = 0 by a discrete group zk  zl. we
show that the higgs branch of the moduli space of the gauge theory is the resolved or
(partially) resolved conifold singularity, depending on the values of the fi parameters as
holomorphic quotients. the moduli spaces for n = 2 theories has been interpreted in
terms of symplectic quotients in a linear sigma model approach in [10], and in terms of
holomorphic quotients in the mathematical approach in [11]. in [17], the latter approach
has been extended to n = 1 theories utilizing some ideas from [11, 18]. we also use
toric geometry to study in detail the correspondence between d3 branes at orbifolded
conifolds and brane congurations obtained after t-dualities (for details on toric geom-

1

etry see [11]). in [12, 13, 14], d-branes on various other singularities have been studied
in the lines of [17]. the paper of [29] dealt with generalized conifolds gkl : xy = ukvl.

this content of this paper is as follows: in section 2 we give a toric description of the
quotient singularity of the three dimensional conifold. in section 3 we review relevant
eld theory and brane congurations. we argue why brane box model is more suitable
for orbifolded conifolds.
in section 4 we derive toric data for the simplest orbifolded
conifold c2,2. in section 5 we derive toric data for the orbifolded conifold c2,3. in section
6 we describe dierent phases of the vacuum moduli space.

2 toric geometry of orbifolded conifolds

in this section, we will briey review toric singularity and its physical realization by the
moduli space of the d-brane world-volume gauge theory on it via gauged linear sigma
models to x notations and terminologies. for detailed review, we refer to [17]. a toric
variety is a space which contains algebraic torus (c)d as an open dense subset. for
example, a projective space pd = (cd+1  {0})/c is a toric variety because it contains
(c)d = (c)d+1/c  (cd+1  {0})/c. as in the case of the projective space, we will
express our toric varieties as a quotient space (this can be thought of as a holomorphic
quotient in the sense of the geometric invariant theory [19] or as a symplectic reduction
as in gauged linear sigma model. in our cases, these two will be the same [20].):

v = (cq  f)//(c)qd

(2.1)

where q, f and the action of (c)qd on c q are determined by a combinatorial data .
now we give a description of the combinatorial data  for gorenstein canonical singu-
larity (i.e. a singularity with a trivial canonical class, k). consider vectors v1, . . . , vq
in a lattice n = zd  nr = n  r = rd in general position. we introduce the corre-
sponding homogeneous coordinates xi for of cq  f in the holomorphic quotients. in
gauged linear sigma model, these correspond to matter multiplets. there will be (q  d)
independent relations

q

x

i=1

q(a)

i vi = 0,

a = 1, . . . , q  d.

(2.2)

here q(a)s correspond to the charges of the matter elds under u(1)qd which is the
maximal compact subgroup of (c)qd. the d-term equations will be

q

x

i=1

q(a)

i

|xi|2 = ra,

a = 1, . . . , q  d.

(2.3)

in the holomorphic quotient, the charge matrix whose column vectors consist of q(a)
determines the action of (c)qd on cq. here the action can be carried out as written
or in two steps, an (r+)qd action and a u(1)qd action if kahler. the quotient will
depend on the gauge xing determined by the (r+)qd action i.e. the moment map.
in the holomorphic approach, this corresponds to dierent spaces f which give rise
to (partial) resolutions of the original space v. in toric diagram, this corresponds to
dierent triangulations of a convex cone in rd determined by {v1, . . . , vq}. the collection
of these combinatorial data is denoted by  called a fan. the quotient space v will
have gorenstein canonical singularity if there exists   zd such that   vi = 1 for all
i [21]. thus vis will lie on the hyperplane with normal  at a distance 1/kk from the
origin in rd. this imposes the following condition on the charge vectors q(a):

q

x

i=1

q(a)

i = 0,

a = 1, . . . , q  d

(2.4)

to put our discussions in the language of the gauged linear sigma model, recall that
i=1 dzi dzi. the
cq is a symplectic manifold with the standard symplectic form  = i pq
maximal compact subgroup g := u(1)qd of (c)qd acts covariantly on a symplectic
manifold (cq, ) by symplectomorphisms. the innitesimal action will give rise to a
moment map  : cq  g by poisson brackets.
in coordinates, the components of
 : cq  rqd are given by

q

a =

x

i=1

q(a)

i

|xi|2  ra

(2.5)

where ra are undetermined additive constants. the symplectic reduction is then dened
as

v (r)  1(0)/g.

the structure of v (r) will depend on r. it follows from (2.5) that every (c)qd-orbit in
cq will contribute at most one point to v (r) (or one g-orbit to 1(0)). the value of r
will determine the contributing orbits. for a xed r, the set of (c)qd-orbits which do
not contribute is precisely f. the quotient space v (r) carries a symplectic form r by
reducing . the symplectic reduction carries a natural complex structure, in which the
reduced symplectic form becomes a kahler form.

(2.6)

(2.7)

now we will consider quotient singularities of the conifold (i.e. orbifolded conifold).

the conifold is a three dimensional hypersurface singularity in c4 dened by:

c :

xy  uv = 0.

the conifold can be realized as a holomorphic quotient of c4 by the c action given by
[10, 22]

(a1, a2, b1, b2) 7 (a1, a2, 1b1, 1b2)

for   c.

(2.8)

3

thus the charge matrix is the transpose of q = (1, 1,1,1) and  =  will be a
convex polyhedral cone in n

 = z3 where



r = r3 generated by v1, v2, v3, v4  n

v1 = (1, 0, 0),

v2 = (0, 1, 0),

v3 = (0, 0, 1),

v4 = (1, 1,1).

(2.9)

the isomorphism between the conifold c and the holomorphic quotient is given by

x = a1b1,

y = a2b2,

u = a1b2,

v = a2b1.

(2.10)

we take a further quotient of the conifold c by a discrete group zk  zl. here zk acts
on ai, bj by

(a1, a2, b1, b2) 7 (e2i/ka1, a2, e2i/kb1, b2),

and zl acts by

(a1, a2, b1, b2) 7 (e2i/la1, a2, b1, e2i/lb2).

thus they will act on the conifold c by

and

(x, y, u, v) 7 (x, y, e2i/ku, e2i/kv)

(x, y, u, v) 7 (e2i/lx, e2i/ly, u, v).

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

its quotient is called the hyper-quotient of the conifold or the orbifolded conifold and
denoted by ckl. to put the actions (2.10), (2.11) and (2.12) on an equal footing, consider
the over-lattice n:

n = n



+

1
k

(v3  v1) +

1
l

(v4  v1).

(2.15)

now the lattice points   n of  in n is generated by (k + 1)(l + 1) lattice points as a
semigroup (these lattice points will be referred as a toric diagram.). the charge matrix
q will be (k + 1)(l + 1) by (k + 1)(l + 1)  3. the discrete group zk  zl = n/n
will act on the conifold c4//u(1) and its quotient will be the symplectic reduction
c(k+1)(l+1)//u(1)(k+1)(l+1)3 with the moment map associated with the charge matrix
q. the new toric diagram for ckl will also lie on the plane at a distance 1/3 from the
origin with a normal vector (1, 1, 1) and we draw a toric diagram on the plane for c57:
the action (2.13), (2.14) of zk  zl on the conifold c can be lifted to an action on c4
whose coordinates are x, y, u, v. the ring of invariants will be c[xl, yl, xy, uk, vk, uv] and
the orbifolded conifold ckl will be dened by the ideal (xy  uv)c[xl, yl, xy, uk, vk, uv].
thus after renaming variables, the dening equation for the orbifolded conifold will be



ckl : xy = zl,

uv = zk.

3 branes at the singularities and gauge theory

we now put branes to probe the geometric background space. consider a system of
m d3 branes sitting at the orbifolded conifold ckl in the transversal direction. in the
spirit of [9], the corresponding gauge eld theory on the world-volume of d3 has been
obtained in [1] by investigating the action of the discrete group on the eld theory of
the conifold developed in [22].

the discrete group zk  zl acts on the elds ai, bi of the conifold theory as in (2.11)
and (2.12). by starting with a conifold theory with a group su(klm)  su(klm), we
obtain via the projection induced by the actions the following n = 1 supersymmetric
generically chiral gauge theory for a specic choice for the chan-paton matrices:

as explained in [1]. the superpotential is obtained by substituting the surviving elds
into the conifold superpotential:

(a1)i+1,j+1;i,j(b1)i,j;i+1,j(a2)i+1,j;i+1,j(b2)i+1,j;i+1,j+1

moreover, by giving a vev to all the elds (a2)i,j;i1,j1, we obtain an qi,j su(m)i,j
gauge theory with surviving chiral multiplets (a1)i,j;i1,j1, (b1)i,j;i,j+1, (b2)i,j;i,j+1. the
superpotential for these elds will be

w = x

i,j

(a1)i,j;i1,j1(b1)i1,j1;i1,j(b2)i1,j;i,j

(3.19)

this eld theory is that appearing on d3 branes on an orbifold c3/zk  zl.

(a1)i,j;i1,j1(b1)i1,j1;i,j1(b2)i,j1;i,j

we now discuss how to arrive from the congurations with d3 branes at conifold
singularities to congurations with d4 or d5 branes together with both types of ns
branes. from (2.16), we see that the orbifolded conifold can be viewed as a c  c
bration over the z plane. in other words, for generic values of z, the pairs of variables
(x, y) and (u, v) describe c  c. because we have c  c bration over the z plane,
we have two dierent kind u(1) orbits, one in each c ber. so we can perform one t-
duality or two t-dualities along each of these orbits. if we make one t-duality we obtain
a conguration with k ns branes on a circle and all the conguration is at a zl singularity.
as rst explained in [4] and developed in [1], this is a chiral theory. because we still have
a singularity which cannot be controlled by removing ns branes, it is more advantageous
to do both t-dualities in order to use all the geometrical information. by making these,
we arrive to brane box congurations with two compact direction, containing d5 branes
together with both types of ns branes. so by using the geometry, we study the kahler
deformation of the orbifolded conifold with brane boxes. as explained in [30], in order
to account the number of kahler structure parameters necessary to completely solve the
singularity, we need to modify the intersections of the ns branes by so-called diamonds.
by closing the diamonds we turn o the b eld and by rotating the diamonds on a plane
perpendicular on the d5 brane we resolve the singularity to c3/zk  zl.

(4.20)

(4.21)

because the t-dual theory contains ns branes which are perpendicular, the adjoint
elds become massive and they are integrated out, leaving only quadratic terms in the
superpotential. for simplicity we denote the 16 elds by:

a11 = (a1)22;11, a12 = (a1)21;12, a13 = (a1)12;21, a14 = (a1)11;22,

a21 = (a2)11;11, a22 = (a2)12;12, a23 = (a2)21;21, a24 = (a2)22;22,

b11 = (b1)11;12, b12 = (b1)12;11, b13 = (b1)21;22, b14 = (b1)22;21,

b21 = (b2)11;21, b22 = (b2)12;22, b23 = (b2)21;11, b24 = (b2)22;12.

the d term equations are:

|a14|2 + |a21|2  |b12|2  |b23|2 = 1
|a13|2 + |a22|2  |b11|2  |b24|2 = 2
|a12|2 + |a23|2  |b14|2  |b21|2 = 3
|a11|2 + |a24|2  |b13|2  |b22|2 = 4
|b21|2 + |b11|2  |a11|2  |a21|2 = 5
|b22|2 + |b12|2  |a12|2  |a22|2 = 6
|b23|2 + |b13|2  |a13|2  |a23|2 = 7
|b24|2 + |b14|2  |a14|2  |a24|2 = 8

where the fi parameters satisfy the constraint

the superpotential is

there are 16 f-term constraints derived from this superpotential, not all of them in-
dependent. as opposed to other eld theories considered previously in the literature,
our case involves chiral elds so the f term equations will give equality between two
products of three elds as for example the one obtained after taking the derivative with
a11 : b11a22b22 = b21a23b13 and the rest of 15 equations are similar. after solving the
independent f-term equations, we arrive at 10 independent elds, the rest of 6 elds be-
ing expressed in terms of these. we chose a24, a13, a14, b12, b13, b14, b21, b22, b23, b24
as the independent variables. the solution for the f-term equations is:

we now proceed to obtain the vacuum moduli space in the usual way, i.e. by imposing
the f-term constraints and the d-term constraints in the form of symplectic quotients
as the gauged linear sigma model. if we impose only f-term constraints, we can identify
the moduli, denoted by mf , of the 16 elds as a cone m+ in m = z10 by expressing
them in terms of 10 independent elds. to construct this as a symplectic quotient, we
consider the dual cone n+ in n = hom (m, z). it turns out that the dual cone n+ is
generated by 24 lattice points. thus we have a map

t : z24  n,

(4.27)

which is shown in the figure 2.

the transpose of the kernel of t is then a 14  24 charge matrix q which is shown

figure 3. thus we have an exact sequence:

0  z14

tq z24

t n  0.

(4.28)

from this sequence, one can see that the moduli space mf can be expressed as a
holomorphic quotient of c24 by (c)14 whose action is specied by q (or a symplectic
quotient by u(1)14.) via the map induced by t . to incooperate the d-term constraints,

figure 4: the 10  24 matrix u

we need to see how the action of (c)10 on the toric variety mf is represented in these
terms. since the action of (c)10 on the open subset (c)10  mf must be the obvious
multiplication, the action of (c)10 on c24 is specied the transpose of a 10 24 matrix
u such that

t tu = idk.

(4.29)

u is shown in the figure 4.

the d-term equations are represented by a matrix v in the figure 5. we ignored
the charges on the dependent elds because they are already encoded in q. thus on
c24, the d-term constraints are represented by the charge matrix v u. finally the full
set of charges is given by a 21  24 charge matrix q (figure 6.) by concatenating q
and v u. the cokernel of its transpose gives toric data for our vacuum moduli space,
denoted by m. after eliminating redundant variables, it is give in the form of a map

in this case we start with a system of d branes sitting the orbifold conifold singularity

by putting on the m d3 branes on c23, we obtain the eld theory with the gauge group:

the matter content for the theory with the gauge group (5.35) is similar to the one
encountered for the previous orbifolded conifold but we have 24 elds now instead of 16
as before. for simplicity we denote the 24 elds by:

a11 = (a1)22;11, a12 = (a1)21;12, a13 = (a1)32;21, a14 = (a1)31;22

a15 = (a1)12;31, a16 = (a1)11;32, a21 = (a2)11;11, a22 = (a2)12;12

a23 = (a2)21;21, a24 = (a2)22;22, a25 = (a2)31;31, a26 = (a2)32;32

b11 = (b1)11;12, b12 = (b1)12;11, b13 = (b1)21;22, b14 = (b1)22;21

b15 = (b1)31;32, b16 = (b1)32:31, b21 = (b2)11;21, b22 = (b2)12;22

b23 = (b2)21;31, b24 = (b2)22;32, b25 = (b2)31;11, b26 = (b2)32;12

w = a11b11a22b22 + a12b12a21b21 + a13b13a24b24 + a14b14a23b23 +
+a15b15a26b26 + a16b16a25b25  a11b21a23b13  a12b22a24b14
a13b23a25b15  a14b24a26b16  a15b25a21b11  a16b26a22b12

(5.37)

there are 24 f-term constraints derived from this superpotential, not all of them in-
dependent and by solving them we arrive at 14 independent elds, the rest of 10 elds
being expressed in terms of these. we choose

a16, a26, b11, b12, b13, b14, b15, b16, b21, b22, b23, b24, b25, b26

(5.38)

as the independent elds.

the d term equations are:

(5.39)

|a16|2 + |a21|2  |b12|2  |b25|2 = 1
|a15|2 + |a22|2  |b11|2  |b26|2 = 2
|a12|2 + |a23|2  |b14|2  |b21|2 = 3
|a11|2 + |a24|2  |b13|2  |b22|2 = 4
|a14|2 + |a26|2  |b16|2  |b23|2 = 5
|a13|2 + |a25|2  |b15|2  |b24|2 = 6
|b21|2 + |b11|2  |a11|2  |a21|2 = 7
|b22|2 + |b12|2  |a12|2  |a22|2 = 8
|b23|2 + |b13|2  |a13|2  |a23|2 = 9
|b24|2 + |b14|2  |a14|2  |a24|2 = 10
|b25|2 + |b15|2  |a15|2  |a25|2 = 11

(5.40)

we want to implement the same procedure as in the previous z2  z3 orbifolded
conifold c22. as before, we can identify the moduli space mf of 24 elds under the
f-term constraints as a cone m+ in m = z14. the dual cone n+ is generated by 80
lattice points represented by t . thus m can be expressed as a symplectic quotient
c80//u(1)66 whose action is specied by q. this can be expressed as the following
exact sequence:

t n  0.

figure 8: z3  z2 hyper quotient of the conifold

by further imposing 11 d-term equations from (5.40), we obtain a three dimensional
toric variety c80//u(1)77. because of huge sizes of the matrices involved, we only
write the nal toric data. one can compute these matrices easily using a software like
mathematica. the toric data will consists of the following 12 vectors:

v1 = (0, 0, 1),
v5 = (1, 2, 0),
v9 = (1, 3,1), v10 = (0, 2,1), v11 = (1, 1,1), v12 = (2, 4,1).

v4 = (3,3, 1),
v8 = (2,1, 0),

v3 = (2,2, 1),
v7 = (1, 0, 0),

v2 = (1,1, 1),
v6 = (0, 1, 0),

(5.42)

we draw them in figure 8 . this is exactly the toric data for the z3  z2 orbifolded
conifold c32.

6 partial resolutions

in order to see the (partial) resolution of the singularities in the formalism used above,
we need to turn on the fayet-iliopoulos terms. this will correspond to a triangulation
of the convex cone in toric geometry and moving the center of the moment map in
symplectic reduction.

before starting the actual discussion, we make some observations about the general
in [29] it was considered the case of generalized conifolds of type xy = ukvk
cases.
and their resolutions. their partial resolutions are conifold singularities, pinch point
singularities and orbifold singularities and are obtained for dierent values of the fi
parameters. in the t dual picture, d3 branes at xy = ukvk singularities transform into
k ns branes, k ns branes on circle together with d4 branes having the circle as one of
the worldvolume coordinates. partial resolutions of the singularity are obtained in the
t-dual picture by moving one ns brane in the x7 direction (in eld theory this means
to give expectation values to one eld thus breaking the product of two gauge groups
to a diagonal one). this smoothen the singularity to xy = uk1vk. by removing a ns

15

brane, the singularity is smoothen to xy = ukvk1. in [29], the starting point was d3
at xy = u2v2 singularity whose t dual contains 2 ns and 2 ns branes. by removing
the two ns branes one arrives at the conifold singularity, by removing one ns and one
ns one arrives at the conifold and by removing either one ns or one ns the pinch
point singularity is obtained. this of course means that we resolve the initial worse
singularity to a smoother one. by removing ns branes we have complete control on
the spacetime singularity.

in the case of orbifolded conifolds we need to use brane box models obtained by
making two t-dualities. in this case, the resolutions are obtained either by moving ns
and ns branes with respect to each other or by opening diamonds at the intersections
of the ns and ns branes.

the discussion is similar for both types of zk  zl orbifolded conifolds discussed in
this paper. let us consider the z2  z2 orbifolded conifold case. from (4.32), we have
a moment map m : c9  r6:

m =





2|p3|2  2|p4|2  |p6|2 + |p8|2  21  2  4  5 + 7
|p3|2  |p4|2  |p6|2 + |p7|2  1 + 7
|p3|2  2|p4|2 + |p5|2  1 + 3 + 6 + 7
|p0|2  2|p3|2 + |p6|2 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 6
|p2|2  2|p4|2 + |p6|2 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7
|p1|2  |p3|2  |p4|2 + |p6|2 + 2 + 6





(6.43)

where pi are homogeneous coordinates of c9. then the m is the symplectic reduction
1
m (0)/u(1)6. from the conditions of (4.33), fayet-iliopoulos parameters of the resulting
u(1)6 gauged linear sigma model satisfy inequalities

 21  2  4  5 + 7 < 0,
1 + 7 < 0,
1 + 3 + 6 + 7 < 0,
1 + 2 + 5 + 6 < 0,
2 + 3 + 6 + 7 < 0.

(6.44)

but the condition (4.33) does not determine the sign of the last coordinate 2 + 6 of the
center of the moment map m. notice that the last coordinate of the moment map m
which is opped as the sign of 2 + 6 changes. when 2 + 6 > 0, it is parameterized by
the homogeneous coordinates p3 and p4. when 2 + 6 < 0, it is parameterized by the
homogeneous coordinates p1 and p6. these two phases are topologically dierent. thus
the d-brane vacuum moduli space m does have topologically distinct phases which are

figure 9: a op transition between dierent phases

related by a op transition. this phenomenon has been observed for orbifold singularities
[12, 13]. we can see this op in the toric diagram which is shown in figure 9 .

for special values of i, there are several singularity types. of course, we get the orb-
ifolded conifold c22 when all  are zero. but the singularity becomes partially resolved,
when elds get expectation values in terms of the fi parameters. one of the most inter-
esting case is when we give expectation values to the elds a2i, i = 1,   , 4. this region
corresponds to 5 + 1 = 6 + 2 = 7 + 3 = 8 + 4. hence the last three coordinates
of the center of the moment map m are zeros. thus one can see that the lower left
half triangle of the toric diagram will not be triangulated. so we will have an orbifold
singularity c3/z2  z3 for generic values of i under these circumstances (figure 10).
the conguration of d3 branes at this singularity is t-dual to a 2  2 brane box with
trivial identication of the unit cell. in the language of [30], giving expectation values
to the elds a2i, i.e. going to a baryonic branch, means to rotate the diamonds which
lie at the intersections of the ns and ns branes. one can have similar discussions for
the z2  z3 orbifolded conifold.

7 conclusions

in this paper we have study the correspondence between brane congurations and brane
at singularities for the case of orbifolded conifolds of type ckl. we have used the toric
geometry (and wittens gauged linear sigma model) to identify the higgs moduli space
of the eld theory living on the brane with the orbifolded conifold singularity. we have
shown that the higgs moduli space does have phases related by a op transition and
topology change can occur.
