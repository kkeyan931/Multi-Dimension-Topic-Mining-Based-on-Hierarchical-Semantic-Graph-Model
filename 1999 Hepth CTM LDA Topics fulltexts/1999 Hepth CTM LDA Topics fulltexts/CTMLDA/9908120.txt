(2.3) + regarded creation annihilation operators, introduce ground states annihilated two states related |i = 0. |+i = +|i. rya=1 (2.4) (2.5) anti-commutation relations (2.3) regarded cliord algebra m. therefore, hilbert space made quantizing fermion zero modes maps space spinor elds m. since complex manifold, spinor eld simply represented form values k 1/2, k canonical line bundle m. consider general state fermionic space aq a1 |+i, (2.6) regarded (0, q)-form values k 1/2. precisely speaking, forms take values k 1/2 also line bundle w, since |+i regarded (0, 0)-form values w. determine line bundle w let us consider canonical quantization yang-mills chern-simons theory. momentum conjugate aa given = 1 g2 f 0i k 4 ijaa j . writing formally = i/aa , 1 g2 f 0i = daa , daa = aa + k 4 ijaa j (2.7) (2.8) (2.9) connection line bundle w. connection form k j means line bundle lk, l basic line bundle. supercharges theory 4 ijaa 3 written terms connection q+ = q = 1 g2zt 2 g2zt 2 1 trf0z =zt 2 trf0z+ =zt 2 tr tr+ daz daz , . (2.10) (2.11) therefore, supercharges q+ q identied operators, decomposition dirac operator acting spinors valued w = lk. since two operators obey { , } = h, 2 = ( )2 = 0, (2.12) h hamiltonian, space supersymmetric ground states given cohomology n1mi=0 h i(cid:0)m, w k 1/2(cid:1) . g = su(n), cpn1. basic line bundle l = o(1) canonical bundle k = ln. therefore, cohomology groups rewritten (2.13) (2.14) (2.15) use w = lk. thus, supersymmetric index n1mi=0 n1xi=0 h i(cid:0)cpn1, lkn/2(cid:1) , (1)i dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, lkn/2(cid:1) . 0 0<i<n1 =1(k) = cohomology groups computed serre  dimensions follows 0 0 i=n1, r>n dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, lr(cid:1) = (cid:1) binomial coecient means dimension vector space (cid:1) i=0, r0 (cid:0) n+r1 degree r homogeneous polynomials n homogeneous coordinates cpn1. using formula obtain supersymmetric index n=1 yang-mills chern-simons (cid:0) n+r1 r i=0, r<0 (2.16) , r theory, =1(k) = 0 |k|<n/2 (cid:16) k+n/21 kn/2 (cid:17) |k|n/2 4 , (2.17) case k n/2 use serre duality h n1(cpn1, lr) h 0(cpn1, lnr) r n. (2.18) extend computation index case n=2, 3 supersymmetric yang-mills chern-simons theory three-dimensions. first, note n=2 vector multiplet consists one spin 1 vector boson a, two spin 1/2 spinors 1, 2 one spin 0 real adjoint scalar x. since adjoint scalar mass kg2, coulomb branch theory completely lifted. therefore, presence adjoint scalar aect index. so, computation index modied two gluino elds =2(k) = = n1xi=0 n1xi=0 (1)i dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, w k 1/2 k 1/2(cid:1) (1)i dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, lkn(cid:1) . (2.19) similarly, n=3 theory, massive vector multiplet contains one spin 1 vector boson a, three spin 1/2 spinors 1, 2, 3, three spin 0 real adjoint scalars x1, x2, x3 one spin -1/2 spinor . case, also coulomb branch moduli. gluino elds contain one opposite spin eld, contribution one spin 1/2 elds canceled spin -1/2 eld . =3(k) = = n1xi=0 n1xi=0 (1)i dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, w k 3/2 k 1/2(cid:1) (1)i dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, lkn(cid:1) (2.20) therefore, index n=3 theory coincides n=2 one. obtain index n=2, 3 theories serres formula. =2,3(k) =( 0 (cid:0) k1 kn(cid:1) =(cid:0) k1 n1(cid:1) kn 0<k<n . (2.21) k 0 also compute index using serre duality, non-zero valued n, eld theoretical meaning duality understood present. so, assume k positive integer following. discuss relation index brane conguration following section. 5 3 s-rule type iib branes section, explain s-rule branes string theory. s-rule phenomenological rule brane dynamics, rst proposed hanany witten {$9611230$}, needed order make supersymmetric congurations. example, ns5- brane d5-brane, completely twisted conguration space, supersymmetrically connected one d3-brane. use rule nd exact correspondence brane conguration supersymmetric vacua eld theories. explanations rule given various point view refs. . map d3-brane ns5-brane d5- brane m2-brane two m5-branes u-duality, obtain following rule m-theory: conguration two completely twisted m5-brane connected one m2-brane supersymmetric. obtain supersymmetric brane congurations keeping srule various string theory m-theoretical rule string duality. con- sider generalization s-rule d3-branes two dierent type (p, q)5-brane.
