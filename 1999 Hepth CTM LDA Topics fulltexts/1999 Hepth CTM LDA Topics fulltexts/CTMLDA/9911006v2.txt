recently a class of gauged o(3) sigma models in three dimensions have been studied

[15] where a u(1) subgroup of the o(3) symmetry of the model was gauged by coupling

the sigma model elds with a gauge eld through the corresponding u(1) current. this is

dierent from the minimal coupling via the topological current discussed previously [6]. the

motivation behind the new gauged o(3) sigma models was to break the scale invariance of

the self - dual solutions of the usual o(3) sigma model [7]. initially the gauge eld dynamics

was assumed to be dictated by the maxwell term [1]. later the extension of the model with

the chern - simons coupling was investigated [2]. a particular form of self - interaction was

required to be included in these models in order to saturate the bogomolnyi bounds [8]. the

form of the assumed self - interaction potential is of crucial importance. the minima of the

potential determine the vaccum structure of the theory. the solutions change remarkably

when the vaccum structure exhibits spontaneous breaking of the symmetry of the gauge

group. thus it was demonstrated that the observed degeneracy of the solutions of [1,2] is

lifted when potentials with symmetry breaking minima were incorporated [4,5].

a generalisation of the models [1,2] was proposed in [3] where an adjustable real param-

eter v was introduced in the expression of the self - interaction potential. detailed solutions

of the model with the c - s coupling were provided. the parameter v interpolates between

the symmetric and symmetry breaking phases. the inclusion of such adjustable potential in

the corresponding maxwell coupled model was conjectured, but not fully explored. in this

letter we show that this generalisation indeed leads to certain important consequences. the

most interesting outcome is a kind of critical phenomenon where a new self - dual soliton

mode emerges when the parameter v decreases below v = 1.

it will be useful to start with a brief review of the nonlinear o(3) sigma model [7]. the

lagrangian of the model is given by,

l =

1
2

  

(1)

here  is a triplet of scalar elds constituting a vector in the internal space with unit norm

a = na  , (a = 1, 2, 3)

(2)

2

   = aa = 1

(3)

the vectors na constitute a basis of unit orthogonal vectors in the internal space. we work

in the minkowskian space - time with the metric tensor diagonal, g = (1, 1, 1).

the nite energy solutions of the model (1) satises the boundary condition

lima = a
(0)

(4)

at physiacal innity. the condition (4) corresponds to one point compactication of the

physical innity. the physical space r2 becomes topologically equivalent to s2 due to this

compactication. the static nite energy solutions of the model are then maps from this

sphere to the internal sphere. such solutions are classied by the homotopy [9]

we can construct a current

2(s2) = z

k =

1
8

  (   )

which is conserved irrespective of the equation of motion. the corresponding charge

t = z d2xk0
=

1

8 z d2xij  (i  j )

(5)

(6)

(7)

gives the winding number of the mapping (5) [10].

in the class of gauged models of our interest here a u(1) subgroup of the rotation sym-

metry of the model (1) is gauged. we chose this to be the so(2) [u(1)] subgroup of rotations

about the 3 - axis in the internal space. the lagrangian of our model is given by

l =

1
2

d  d

f f  + u()

d is the covariant derivative given by

d =  + an3

(8)

(9)

the so(2) (u(1)) subgroup is gauged by the vector potential a whose dynamics is dictated

by the maxwell term. here f are the electromagnetic eld tensor,

f = a   a

(10)

u() is the self - interaction potential required for saturating the self - dual limits. we chose

u() = 

1
2

(v  3)2

(11)

where v is a real parameter. substituting v = 0 we get back the model of [5] whereas v = 1

gives the model of [1].

we observe that the minima of the potential arise when ,

3 = v

which is equivalent to the condition

2
1 + 2

2 = 1  v2

on account of the constraint (3). the values of v must be restricted to

|v|  1

(12)

(13)

(14)

the condition (13) denotes a latitudinal circle (i.e. circle with xed latitude) on the unit

sphere in the internal space. by varying v from -1 to +1 we span the sphere from the south

pole to the north pole. it is clear that the nite energy solutions of the model must satisfy

(13) at physical innity. for v 6= 1 this boundary condition corresponds to the spontaneous

breaking of the symmetry of the gauge group and in the limit

|v|  1

(15)

the asymmetric phase changes to the symmetric phase. we call the potential (11) interpo-

lating in this sense. in the asymmetric phase the soliton solutions are classied according

to the homotopy

4

1(s1) = z

(16)

instead of (5).

in the symmetric phase, however, this new topology disappears and the

solitons are classied according to (5) as in the usual sigma model (1).

in the following

we will observe a remarkable fallout of this change of topology. the fundamental solitonic

mode n = 1 (n being the vorticity) ceases to exist in the symmetric phase. the modes

corresponding to n = 2 onwards still persist but the magnetic ux associated with them

ceases to remain quantised.

in the asymmetric phase the vorticity is the winding number i.e. the number of times by

which the innite physical circle winds over the latitudinal circle (13). associated with this

is a uniqe mapping of the internal sphere where the degree of mapping is usually fractional.

by inspection [1] we construct a current

k =

1
8

[  d  d  f (v  3)]

(17)

generalising the topological current (6). the current (17) is manifestly gauge invariant and

diers from (6) by the curl of a vector eld [1]. the conservation principle

k  = 0

(18)

thus automatically follows from the conservation of (6). the corresponding conserved charge

is

t = z d2xk0

(19)

using (17) and (19) we can write

t = z d2x[

1
8

ij  (i  j )] 

1

4 zboundary

(v  3)ard

(20)

where r, are polar coordinates in the physical space and a = e  a. using the boundary

condition (12) we nd that t is equal to the degree of the mapping of the internal sphere.

note that this situation is dierent from [3] where the topological charge usually diers from

5

the degree of the mapping. in this context it is interesting to observe that the current (17)

is not unique because we can always add an arbitrary multiple of

1
8

f 

(21)

with it without aecting its conservation. we chose (17) because it generates proper topo-

logical charge.

the euler - lagrange equations of the system (8) is derived subject to the constraint (3)

by the lagrange multiplier technique

d(d) = [d(d)  ] + n3(v  3) + (v  3)3

f  = j

where

using (22) we get

j = n3  j and j =   d

dj = (v  3)(n3  )3

from (23) we nd,for static congurations

2a0 = a0(1  2
3)

from the last equation it is evident that we can chose

a0 = 0

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

as a consequence we nd that the excitations of the model are electrically neutral.

we now construct the energy functional from the symmetric energy - momentum tensor.

the energy

e =

2 z d2x(cid:20)d0  d0  di  di + (v  3)2  2(f

. for static conguration and the choice a0 = 0, e becomes

e =

1

2 z d2x[(di)  (di) + f 2

12 + (v  3)2]

(29)

several observations about the nite energy solutions can be made at this stage from (29).

by dening

we get

 = 1 + i2

di  di = |(i + iai)|2 + (i3)2

the boundary condition (13) dictates that

  (1  v2)

1

2 ein

at innity. from (29) we observe that for nite energy congurations we require

a = e

n
r

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

on the boundary. this scenario is exactly identical with the observations of [5] and leads to

the quantisation of the magnetic ux

 = z bd2x = zboundary

ard = 2n

(34)

the basic mechanism leading to this quantisation remains operative so far as v is less than

1. at v = 1, however, the gauge eld a becomes arbitrary on the boundary except for the

requirement that the magnetic eld b should vanish on the boundary. we will presently show

that not all the vortices present in the broaken phase survives this demand. specically, the

n = 1 vortex becomes inadmissible.

now the search for the self - dual conditions proceed in the usual way. we rearrange the

energy functional as

e =

1

2 z d2x[

1
2

(di  ij  dj)2 + (f 12  (v  3))2]  4t

(35)

7

equation (35) gives the bogomolnyi conditions

di  ij  dj = 0

f12  (v  3) = 0

(36)

(37)

which minimize the energy functional in a particular topological sector, the upper sign

corresponds to +ve and the lower sign corresponds to -ve value of the topological charge.

we will now turn towards the analysis of the self - dual equations using the rotationally

symmetric ansatz [11]

1(r, ) = sin g(r) cos n

2(r, ) = sin g(r) sin n

3(r, ) = cos g(r)
na(r)

a(r, ) = e

r

from (12) we observe that we require the boundary condition

g(r)  cos1 v as r  

and equation (33) dictates that

a(r)  1 as r  

(38)

(39)

(40)

remember that equation (33) was obtained so as the solutions have nite energy. again for

the elds to be well dened at the origin we require

g(r)  0 or  and a(r)  0 as r  0

substituting the ansatz(38) into (36) and (37) we nd that

n(a + 1)

sin g,

g(r) = 

a(r) = 

r

r
n

(v  cos g)

8

(41)

(42)

(43)

where the upper sign holds for +ve t and the lower sign corresponds to -ve t.equations

(42) and (43) are not exactly integrable. however, the following analysis of the boundary

value problem dened by (42) and (43) with (39) to (41) in the line of [1] reveals general

nature of the admissible solutions.

using the ansatz (38) we can explicitly compute the topological charge t by performing

the integration in (19).the result is

t = 

n
2

[cos g()  cos g(0)] 

1
2

[v  cos g()]

(44)

the second term of (44) vanishes due to the boundary condition (39). also, when g(0) = 0,

and, when g(0) = ,

t =

n
2

(1  v)

t = 

n
2

(1 + v)

(45)

(46)

it is evident that t is in general fractional. due to (20) it is equal to the degree of mapping

of the internal sphere. this can also be checked explicitly.

from the above analysis we nd that g(0) = 0 corresponds to +ve t and g(0) = 

corresponds to -ve t. we shall restrict our attention on negetive t mainly for comparision

with [1]. the boundary value problem of interest is then

g(r) = 

r

a(r) = 

r
n

with

n(a + 1)

sin g

(v  cos g)

g(0) = , a(0) = 0

f () = cos1 v, a() = 0

(47)

(48)

(49)

in addition we require a(r)  0 as r  . looking at (47), (48) and (49), the last condition

appears to be a consistency condition.

9

the behaviour of the functions near r = 0 can be easily derived as in [1]

g(r)   + arn

a(r)  

r2
2n

(1 + v)

(50)

(51)

here a is an arbitrary constant which xes the values of g and a at innity. there is a

critical value of a, a = acrit for which the boundary conditions are satised [5]. if the value

of a is larger than acrit the conditions at innity are overshooted, whereas, if the value is

smaller than the critical value g(r) vanishes asymptotically after reaching a maximum. the

situation is comparable with similar ndings elsewhere [12].

we are specically concerned about the limit v  1 because of our interest in the

transition from asymmetric to symmetric vaccum. first observe that according to (42) and

(43) cos g cannot exceed v in the nite region because in that event a(r) becomes increasing

function and g(r) overshoots the boundary value. a(r) is then always -ve, so that a(r) is a

decreasing function. let a() = . repeating the analysis of [1] we can prove that

 1    0

also, in the limit v  1 g is small and the equation (47) simplies to

which gives on integration,

g(r) = 

n(a + 1)

r

g

g(r)  crn(+1)

(52)

(53)

(54)

with c being a positive constant. note that  = -1 is admissible in the limit v  1 as long

as (v - 1) is nonzero. this is because g() is then small but nonzero and the boundary

condition on g can be adjusted by c. however, if we put v = 1 then we require g to vanish

on the boundary. this requirement dictates that

 > 1

10

(55)

on the boundary. now expanding the equation (43) we get

a(r) = 

r
2n

(g2  g()2)

so far as g() is small but dierent from zero, the limit

g  g()

is sucient to ensure the condition on a(r). but when g() = 0 we have

thus a can only converge if

i.e.

a(r) = 

c 2
2n

2n( + 1)  1 > 1

(56)

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

clearly n = 1 is not permissible. the mode n = 1 is quenched when v becomes equal to

1. again, in this limit  is arbitrary. so the magnetic ux associated with the surviving

modes is no longer quantised. thus we arrive at our principal result that in the model (8)

with the interpolating potential (11), the soliton mode with vorticity 1 is generated when

the parameter v decreases below the critical value v = 1. along with this, the magnetic ux

associated with the modes present in the v = 1 phase become quantised.

we have considered a gauged o(3) sigma model with the gauge eld dynamics determined

by the maxwell term. an interpolating potential was included as in [3]. this potential

depends on a free parameter, the variation of which eects transition from the symmetric

to asymmetric phase. we have discussed the transition of the associated topology of the

soliton solutions and demonstrated that a new soliton mode emerges when the parameter

decreases below a critical value. this conclusion follows from an analysis of the self - dual

equations at the critical point (i.e. at the transition point). the self - dual equations are,

11

however, not exactly solvable. but they can be studied numerically to trace out the growth

of the generated mode in detail. such analysis may also be interesting from the point of

view of application, particularly in condensed matter physics.
