abstract

we consider the open superstring ending on a d-brane in the presence of a constant
ns-ns b eld, using the green-schwarz formalism. quantizing in the light-cone gauge,
we nd that the anti-commutation relations for the fermionic variables of superspace
remain unmodied. we also derive the unbroken supersymmetry algebra living on the
d-brane. this establishes how the moyal product is extended in a superspace formula-
tion of non-commutative eld theories. the supereld formulation of non-commutative
supersymmetric eld theories is briey considered.

1 introduction

during the last years, there has been remarkable progress in understanding the dynamics
of supersymmetric gauge theories and string theory. in fact, both elds have beneted
from each other, in elaborate and beautiful ways. recently, a new connection between
them has arisen: string theory backgrounds with a constant ns-ns b eld correspond,
in the sen-seiberg limit [3], to non-commutative gauge theories [1, 2]. the dynamics of
these theories appears up to now quite mysterious, in particular at distances comparable to
the non-commutativity scale. looking back to the examples of ordinary supersymmetric
gauge theories, it seems quite possible that supersymmetry will provide strong constraints
on the dynamics of these non-commutative eld theories.

therefore, it seems worthwhile to analyze how supersymmetry is realized in these
theories. to this end, we would like to work in a context where supersymmetry is as man-
ifest as possible. for certain numbers of spacetime dimensions and supersymmetries, one
can construct a superspace and supereld formalism for ordinary supersymmetric eld
theories.
it is very likely that a similar construction is available for non-commutative
supersymmetric eld theories, where some additional fermionic variables promote a given
manifold to a supermanifold. but then, as a mathematical question in the context of
non-commutative geometry, one could imagine dierent consistent deformations of the
fermionic anti-commutation rules. for example, a possible deformation of the multiplica-
tion between fermionic coordinates of superspace could be

f ()  g() = e

 f ()g()|=,

where  is symmetric. an explicit deformation of n = 1 superspace in two dimensions
has been considered in [4]. quantum group [5] like deformations may also be envisaged.
to nd out what happens in string theory is one of the purposes of this letter.

in previous papers [6, 7, 8, 9], the quantization of an open string ending on a d-brane
with a constant ns-ns b-eld background was carried out in the rns formulation.
the result was that the spacetime coordinates on the world-volume of the d-brane were
non-commutative.
in this paper we analyze the same situation, but with the string
formulated in the green-schwarz [10] language1. we will take advantage of the manifest
spacetime supersymmetry in this formalism to obtain the anti-commutation relations for
the grassmanian variables  of superspace, in a situation where the bosonic coordinates
x do not commute. the result is that the fermionic coordinates are undeformed, and have
the same anti-commutation rules on the brane. also, we will derive the supersymmetry
algebra living on the d-brane and verify that its structure is not modied. hence, if
we want to work with superelds evaluated on at superspace, their non-commutative

variables  of superspace.

the paper is organized as follows. we start in section 2, reviewing the construction of
the green-schwarz (gs) superstring action in a general type ii supergravity background;
after that, we deal with the case of interest: a at background with a constant ns-ns
b eld, where the d-brane boundary conditions are established and solved. in section 3
we carry out the light-cone quantization of the gs superstring; we compute the unbro-
ken supersymmetry algebra living on the world-volume of the d-brane, nding the same
structure as in the ordinary (commutative) theories; we also show how the appearance of
the moyal product can be understood from the oscillator quantization method. finally,
in section 4 we introduce the notions of superspace and superelds in non-commutative
geometry. the wz model is discussed as an illustrative example, and we observe that the
perturbative non-renormalization theorem for the f-term is still valid.

2 d-branes in the covariant green-schwarz

formalism

2.1 green-schwarz superstring in a general type ii background

the rst thing we need to know is how the gs superstring couples to the b-eld. in this
subsection we review the construction of [13], which ensures a -invariant action.

let us start by setting up some conventions. the ten dimensional n = 2 superspace
is a supermanifold of dimension (10|32). since we will rst present the gs superstring
propagating in a general type ii supergravity background, we denote by z m = (x , m)
its local coordinates and by a = (a, ) its target space tangent indices. underlining an
index indicates that it is 10 dimensional 2. the super-vielbeins are denoted by em
a. the
fermionic variables  are spacetime spinors and consist of two majorana-weyl spinors.
in type iia superspace, these spinors carry opposite chiralities, which can be combined
into a single 32 component majorana spinor; while in type iib they are of the same
chirality. we will use the fermionic index  for both cases.
in type iia, it is a 32
dimensional spinor index, while in type iib it is understood to be a composite index of
a majorana spinor index (32 dimensional) and an so(2) doublet index acted on by the

2we are following basically the notation and conventions of [14] for the super-embedding, except that,
in order to simplify the notation, we will not distinguish whether a fermionic index is 10 dimensional or
(p + 1)-dimensional (for a dp-brane) and so we will not underline the fermionic indices. this is sucient
for our purposes, as we will not need to split the 10-dimensional -matrices into those appropriate for
the (p + 1)-dimensional submanifold. all the -matrices in this paper are the ten dimensional ones

pauli matrices. chiral projection operators should be inserted in appropriate places to
reduce the majorana indices to majorana-weyl ones.

the covariant -symmetric action for the n = 2 superstring in a supergravity back-

ground takes the form [13]

i =

(2)

where gij is the metric of the world-sheet, 01 = 1, ab = diag(, +, ..., +) is the 10d
minkowski spacetime metric and the pull-back super-vielbeins are

what is relevant for us is the second term in (2), the pull-back of the 2-form supereld

a, ei

).

(3)

b =

ebeabab ,

(4)

which is the (local) potential of the closed super 3-form h = db of type ii supergravity.
since we will consider world-sheets with boundaries, properly there are also the vector
superelds a with supersymmetric couplings to the string [14]. but in order to simplify
the discussion, and without any loss of generality for the case of constant b-eld, we
conne to the gauge where a is zero.

the action (2) is invariant under the -symmetry:

z a = 0 ,
z  = 1

with the denitions z a := z m em

(6)

note that 11 acts on the 32-component majorana index, while 3 acts on the so(2)
doublet index of the two 16-component majorana-weyl spinors of type iib.

the constraints which follow by demanding -symmetry invariance of (2) correspond
to the ones of the 10d n = 2 supergravity multiplet [15]. there are the constraints on
the torsion super two-form,

and  is a spinor supereld [16] proportional to the dilaton supereld of the supergravity
background, ie.   d.

2.2 constant b-eld in flat spacetime

we are interested in type ii backgrounds with at 10 dimensional minkowski spacetime
and a constant b-eld. in this case, the dilaton is constant and  = 0. with no distinction
between curved and tangent indices, the torsion constraints (7) are satised by the at
space pull-back,

ei

(10)

equally, the 3-form constraints (8) are solved by the super 2-form bab with the non-zero
components

b = constant ,
b = i(q) + ib() ,
b = ()((q))  b()() .

(11)

substituting the expressions (10) and (11) into the action (2), we nd

i =

where we have introduced the more common notation (ei
a (a = 1, 2) the two majorana-weyl spinors of type ii. we have also used in the above
that 11 = 1 for 1 (+1 for 2) in iia and 3 = 1 for 1 (-1 for 2) in iib. since (10) and
(11) satisfy the constraints (7) and (8), the action (12) is guaranteed to be -symmetric.

 ) i

thus, we see that for a constant b-eld, the only eect on the action is the addition
of the last term in (12), the usual bosonic coupling to the target space. a coupling to the
fermionic spacetime variables a would arise only if b were not closed. the couplings to
boundary elds can be discussed using the d-brane vertex operators.

2.3 d-brane boundary conditions

we split the 10d indices  = 0, 1,   , 9, into  = 0, 1,   , p for the directions longitudinal
to the dp-brane world-volume 3 and  = p + 1,   , 9 for its transverse directions. the
components b along the direction of the brane are non-zero in the chosen gauge a = 0.
the remaining components, b , are set to zero by a gauge transformation. since b is
constant, the equations of motion take the same form as in the case with zero b-eld,

i  j  1
2gijgklk  l = 0 ,

where p

for the boundary terms, however, the b eld matters. in the world-sheet conformal
gauge, with coordinates i = {, }, the variation of the action (12) requires the following
boundary contributions to be zero:

x(cid:16)

  i1 1 + i2 2(cid:17) + x x b

+i x (11  22) + (11 2 2  22 1 1)|=0, = 0. (14)
the x terms and the  terms must vanish independently. since x  =   x  6= 0,
the vanishing of all the x terms requires the following boundary conditions ( = 0, ):

 + i(aa)



= 0,
 = 0,
1( +  )1 + 2(   )2 = 0 .

 x 
x  +  x b

 = p + 1, ..., 9 ,
 = 0, ..., p ,

(15)
(16)
(17)

we will comment on the last condition later. using (15) and (16), the  terms reduce to
( = 0, )

ix (11 + 22) + i x [(1  b) 22  (1 + b) 11]

+22 2 2  11 1 1.

(18)

this can be made to vanish if we relate the two majorana-weyl spinors at the ends of
the open string, by imposing

3for convenience in the light-cone gauge, in section 3 we will take the 9-direction to be always longi-

tudinal to the d-brane.

and

in particular, since 11 = +1 for 2 (-1 for 1) in iia and 3 = +1 for 2 (-1 for 1) in
iib, we have

(24)

in both iia and iib. the relations (19), (22) and (24) guarantee that the rst line of (18)
vanishes. the second line also vanishes by using (24) twice.

observe that with the boundary condition (19), the action (12) is now invariant under

the spacetime supersymmetry transformations,

x  = iaa,
a = a

only when the constant spinors a are related by

2 = b1 .

(25)

(26)

one can easily verify that 2
b = 1, and therefore the previous equation completely de-
termines one majorana-weyl spinor in terms of the other. it only leaves 16 independent
supersymmetry transformations linearly realized on the d-brane. these are exactly the
ones found in [17], where the matrix b appeared in the -symmetry transformations for
the supersymmetric born-infeld action of a dp-brane, in a background where the gauge
invariant combination f = da  b was non vanishing 4. here we derived the same con-
dition from the open string. we also note that, for the particular case of the d3-brane,
2 = i sign(pf(b))1 when b  . the additional factor of i we have, as compared to
[2], is due to the minkowskian metric.

4with the slight dierence that our b is their if due to our normalization of the b-eld.

7

one can also check that the boundary conditions are compatible with the supersym-

metry (25), (26). supersymmetric variation of (15) gives

x 

= ia

a = 0

(27)

using (22); while that of (16) gives

(x  +  x b

( +  )1,

(28)
where we have used 2 = b1 which follows from (19) and the equations of motion
(13). hence, the boundary conditions are supersymmetric if we also impose

) = 2i1(b/(1  b))

this, together with (17), gives

( +  )1 = 0,

 = 0, .

(   )2 = 0,

 = 0, .

(29)

(30)

equations (29),(30) are nothing but part of the equations of motion in light-cone gauge
and thus imposing these boundary conditions is consistent with light-cone gauge xing.

3 light-cone gauge

the covariant quantization of the green-schwarz superstring encounters serious obstacles.
on the other hand, the quantization in light-cone gauge is as straightforward as in the
rns formalism, with the advantage that spacetime supersymmetry is manifest.

taking the directions 0 and 9 to be along the d-brane 5, the light-cone gauge is dened

by

(31)
(32)
where x  12(x 0  x 9) and   12 (0  9). observe that (32) is compatible with
the boundary condition (19), assuming that b0 = b9 = 0.

3.2 unbroken supersymmetry

in this subsection, we will give a more explicit analysis of the unbroken supersymmetry
living on the brane when b 6= 0. we will rst identify the unbroken supercharges and
then derive their supersymmetry algebra from the commutation relations (49)-(53).

to preserve light-cone gauge conditions (31) and (32) under the supersymmetry trans-
formations (25), we have to perform a compensating -symmetry transformation. in order
to present concrete formulae, we consider the case of type iib and denote the supersym-
metry parameters (with the convention that both have negative chirality, a = 11a)
by

with h being light-cone gauge hamiltonian (48). this shows that while the linear com-
bination (62) of unbroken supersymmetry depends on the b-eld, the form of the super-
symmetry algebra is not deformed by the b-eld. we will also discuss the consequences
of this in section 4.

and shows that (67) implies (68) and (69). the zero modes of (67) in the ramond sector
form the usual cliord algebra acting on the ground state and represent the unbroken
supersymmetry on the d-brane.

conclusions are obtained if one uses conformal eld theory methods. as was derived in
[18], the world-sheet propagator for the bosonic elds x acquires a crucial new logarithmic
term in the presence of a constant b-eld. in the sen-seiberg limit, it is

hxi( )xj(0)i = i
which by the radial ordering prescription, gives

ij

sign( ),

[xi( ), xj( )] = t (cid:16)xi( +)xj( )  xi( )xj( +)(cid:17) = iij.

(73)

the leading ope for normal ordered (i.e. nite) bosonic open string vertex operators was
shown [8, 2] to become the moyal product.

on the other hand, since the fermion propagators satisfy rst order dierential equa-
it is true that their boundary

tions, they do not carry any logarithmic branch cut.
conditions modify their ope; for instance, in type iib:

(a)a( )(a)b() 
(1)a( )(2)b() 

, a = 1, 2 (not summed) ,

ab
  
n ab
.
  

however, there is no modication of their anti-commutators,

{(a)a, (b)b} = t (cid:16)(a)a( +)(b)b( ) + (a)a( )(b)b( +)(cid:17) = 0

which agrees with (52).

let us remark on how the moyal phases come out in the oscillators quantization
method. consider the zero momentum fock-space ground state of the open bosonic

13

string, |0, 0i. the tachyon state |0, ki is obtained by the insertion in the far past of the
tachyon vertex operator, located at the world-sheet boundary (take for instance  = 0)

explicitly, the state is

v0(k;  ) =: eikx(0, ) : .

|0, ki = lim
+i

ei v0(k;  )|0, 0i.

since v0(k,  ) is normal ordered, (78) is just

|0, ki = eikx0|0, 0i.

observe that (79) satises the intuitive property that in the absence of a b eld,

|0, k1 + k2i = ei(k1+k2)x0|0, 0i = eik1x0|0, k2i = eik2x0|0, k1i.

(77)

(78)

(80)

but when there is a constant background b 6= 0, the state (79) with momentum k will
no longer satisfy the last three equalities in (80). instead, the moyal phase appears due
to (50)

lim

+i
where k1  k2 := 1
interaction vertices. for example, for the three tachyon vertex

ei v0(k2,  )|0, k1i = eik2x0eik1x0|0, 0i = eik1k2|0, k1 + k2i,
2ijk1,ik2,j. this explains the appearance of the moyal phases in

h0, k1|v0(k2, 0)|0, k3i = h0, k1|eik2k3|0, k2 + k3i = eik2k3(k1 + k2 + k3).

4 discussion: superspace and superelds

we have derived that for the non-commutative supersymmetric quantum eld theories ob-
tained from string theory, the fermionic variables  continue to anti-commute. motivated
by this, we introduce the non-commutative supereld, (x, ), to be a local function

(x, ) = (x) + (x) +   

(83)

obviously, it continues to have a nite taylor expansion in . the moyal product for
superelds evaluated on the supermanifold completely ignores the fermionic coordinates,
i.e.,

i(x, )  j (x, ) = e

iij

= i(x)  j (x) + (cid:16)i(x)  j (x) + i(x)  j (x)(cid:17) +    (85)

in order to be concrete, let us focus on the case of 4d n = 1 supersymmetry 9. it
has supercharges {q, q } and the supersymmetry algebra can be obtained by a conve-
nient truncation of the 10d n = 1 supersymmetry algebra (64) 10 the realization of the
supercharges as rst order dierential operators on the superspace {x, , } is the same
as in the ordinary spacetime case. the same is true for the supersymmetric covariant
derivatives, {d, d }. supersymmetry transformations are generated by the usual shifts
of the superspace variables:

   + 
x  x + i   i  ,

(86)
(87)

and the same sort of supersymmetric eld transformations are obtained. the only mod-
ication comes from replacing the ordinary commutative product by the moyal product
for any product of x-dependent quantities.

superelds can be introduced as eld representations of the supersymmetry algebra.
for example, chiral superelds satisfy d  = 0. supersymmetric invariant actions are
constructed in the same way, as integrals in superspace of some x-dependent supereld
expression. the most general lagrangian that can be built from scalar chiral superelds
takes the form

l = z d2d2 k(, ) +z d2 w() + h.c.

(88)

we will still refer to k(, ) as the kahler potential, simply because we still have the
symmetry
(89)

k(, )  k(, ) + f () + f ().

it is easy to show that the auxillary elds are nonpropagating and can be eliminated to
give a supersymmetric action in terms of on-shell states only. this apparently diers from
the situation in some higher derviative actions, e.g. in n = 2 sym with nonholomorphic
corrections, where the auxillary elds can become propagating. 11

observe that, for chiral superelds, one still has the powerful notion of a holomor-
phic superpotential w(), which only requires a chiral -integral to be included in the
lagrangian. also, one can formulate feynman super-graphs for (88). all the quadratic
divergences are cancelled out manifestly. it is easy to show that any perturbative quan-
tum corrections to the eective action will be an integral over the whole superspace.
then, modulo the usual subtleties arising from massless elds, the perturbative non-
renormalization of the f-term still holds for non-commutative supersymmetric eld the-

9we follow the conventions of [19].

ories. 12 it has been argued in [22] that noncommutative wess-zumino model is renor-
malizable.

obviously, the most interesting case is non-commutative supersymmetric yang-mills,
where the ward identities of the non-commutative gauge symmetry and its sensitive
embedding in a consistent superstring theory suggests that it is a well dened quantum
theory. but we leave this issue for future studies.

in this letter, we have shown that the manifestly supersymmetric formulation of the
non-commutative supersymmetric eld theories, obtained from string theory in at space-
time and constant b-eld backgrounds, shares a large number of the features in common
with the ordinary supersymmetric eld theories. the notion and construction of super-
space and supereld is the same, without additional deformation of the fermionic variables
. in more general string backgrounds, one may get a more non-trivial moyal product
for the fermionic coordinates of the relevant superspace. it would be interesting to know
which are the admissible moyal products for a given supermanifold and whether and
how they arise in string theory.

manifest supersymmetric formulations have proven to provide useful and powerful
concepts, such as holomorphy and non-renormalization theorems, for analyzing dierent
quantum aspects of the supersymmetric eld theories. it is quite reasonable that a man-
ifestly supersymmetric treatment of non-commutative supersymmetric eld theories will
also shed light on the dynamics of these theories.

12see [20, 21] for a recent discussion of ir eects in non-commutative eld theories. a 1/pp singularity
in the two point function (arising from the 1 loop non-planar diagram) was found in the non-commutative
theory. in particular, it was shown that a light mode is generated whose mass depends on the coupling
of the theory [20]. they also show that no new pole is generated in the supersymmetric case. this can
also be veried easily by doing a simple feynman super-graph calculation.
