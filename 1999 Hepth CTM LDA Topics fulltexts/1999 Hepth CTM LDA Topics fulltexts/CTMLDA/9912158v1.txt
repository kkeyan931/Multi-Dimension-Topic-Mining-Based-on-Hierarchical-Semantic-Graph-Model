abstract

using the cutting and sewing procedure we show how to get feynman diagrams,

up to two-loop order, of 4-theory with an internal su (n ) symmetry group, start-

ing from tachyon amplitudes of the open bosonic string theory. in a properly dened

eld theory limit, we easily identify the corners of the string moduli space repro-

ducing the correctly normalized eld theory amplitudes expressed in the schwinger

parametrization.

1 introduction

much interest has been devoted to the relation between string theory and eld theory

over the last years. it is well-known that any string theory reduces to an eective eld
theory in the so-called zero-slope limit where the inverse string tension   0. the
latter is a physical dimensional parameter acting as an ultraviolet cuto in the integrals

over loop momenta and so makes multiloop amplitudes free from ultraviolet divergences.

this is a basic reason why a string theory can provide a consistent quantum theory of

gravity, unied with non-abelian gauge theories.

furthermore, string theory also manages to organize scattering amplitudes in a very

compact form, which makes much easier to calculate non-abelian gauge theory amplitudes

by starting from a string theory and performing the zero-slope limit, rather than using

traditional eld theory techniques. we would like here to add that the expression of string

amplitudes is known explicitly, including also the measure of integration on moduli space,

in the case of the bosonic open string for an arbitrary perturbative order [1].

these are the features of string theory that have led some authors to use it as an
ecient tool to compute gluon amplitudes in yang-mills theory [2]  [6] or in quantum
gravity, where the improvement over traditional techniques was even more spectacular [7],

and light has been shed on the perturbative relations between gravity and gauge theory

[8]. we would like to add that these string-methods have also inspired some authors in

developing very interesting techniques based on the world-line path-integrals [9].

the general procedure on which the derivation of eld theory amplitudes from string

amplitudes is based consists in starting, for example in the case of yang-mills amplitudes,

from a given multiloop gluon string amplitude and in singling out dierent regions of the

moduli space that, in the low-energy limit, reproduce dierent eld theory diagrams.

this program has been carried out at one-loop [10] [11] and, at this order, the ve-gluon

amplitude has been obtained for the rst time [12].

some attempts have been performed for extending to the two-loop case this proce-

dure [11] [13] [14] which while, on the one hand, does not present many diculties in

1

computing yang-mills vacuum diagrams, on the other hand becomes dicult to handle

when treating amplitudes with external states, because of their complicated structure.

in order to avoid the computational diculties associated with this kind of multiloop

yang-mills amplitudes, which are inessential for the understanding of the eld theory

limit, one can consider amplitudes involving scalar particles.

in fact, dierently from

what happens in gauge theories, in string theory there is not a big conceptual dierence

between gluon and scalar diagrams. therefore one can get from scalar amplitudes, with

much less computational cost, the whole information about the corners of the moduli

space reproducing the known eld theoretical results: these regions are exactly the ones

giving the correct eld theory diagrams also in the case of gluon amplitudes.

the scalar particles one is referring are, of course, the tachyons of the bosonic string

theory. so one can consider a slightly dierent zero-slope limit of the bosonic string in
which only the lowest tachyonic state, with a mass satisfying m2 = 1/ is kept. in the
case of tree and one-loop diagrams, this procedure is equivalent to take the zero-slope

limit of an old pre-string dual model characterized by an arbitrary value of the intercept

of the regge trajectory. it was recognized the inconsistency of this model, but the eld

theory limit of tree and one-loop diagrams of this pre-string dual model was shown to

lead to the feynman diagrams of 3 theory [15].

in a previous paper [11], it has been explicitly shown that by performing the zero-

slope limit as above explained, one correctly reproduces the feynman diagrams of 3

theory, up to two-loop order. in this way it has been provided an algorithm generalizable

to yang-mills theory in order to obtain all diagrams containing the three-gluon vertices.

this paper is the natural development of the program carried out in ref.

[11], its

aim being to extend the conceptual scheme pursued in it, to two-loop amplitudes con-

taining four-gluon vertices, whose very complicated structure, when external particles

are involved, has not allowed to get meaningful results up to now. this means that,

exploiting the above mentioned analogy between scalar and gluon amplitudes, one could

start from string amplitudes involving tachyons, perform on them the eld theory limit

in which their mass is xed and correctly identify the corners associated to the dierent

2

eld theory diagrams of 4 theory. as observed in ref. [11], this analysis may be a bit

lengthy, since there are many corners of the string moduli space that contribute to the

same eld theory diagrams. but one can pursue an alternative and equivalent method,

the sewing and cutting procedure, that also leads to the correct identication of eld

theory diagrams and that has been successfully applied to get two-loop 3 amplitudes in

[11]. this is indeed the technique we use in this paper. we would like here to observe

that, until now, four-vertices have been obtained as nite remainders of tachyon exchange

[13] [16] and that one of the main peculiarities of our technique is that the identication

of the right corner in the moduli space is independent on any handling tachyon exchange.

hence it is reasonable to think that the sewing and cutting procedure is easily extendible

to consistent string theories.

finally, another interesting motivation to analyze the eld theory limit of scalar am-

plitudes is understanding the analogous limit in a string theory with a non-zero b-eld.

this limit yields non-commutative eld theories and provides a hope that it would be

possible to cure quantum eld theory divergences [17] [18].

the paper is organised as follows.

in sect. 2 we present the operator formalism that we use for computing multiloop

scalar amplitudes in the bosonic open string theory. we consider scalar particles having

an internal su(n) symmetry group and perform a large n limit of the relative amplitudes

so that only planar diagrams are taken into account.

in sect. 3 we dene the sewing and cutting procedure applying it to the four-tachyon

tree amplitude. we dene a proper eld theory limit where cubic and quartic interactions

are reproduced.

in sect. 4 we check the validity of this procedure by deriving from the two- and four-

tachyon amplitudes at one-loop, respectively, the tadpole and the candy diagram of 4

theory.

in sect. 5 the sunset and the double-candy diagrams are computed. each eld-theory

diagram is obtained with its own right overall normalization.

with e(h)(zi, zj) being the prime form, ( = 1,   , h) the abelian dierentials and

riemann surface of genus h on which the amplitude is dened, can be explicitly written

in the schottky parametrization of the surface itself, and their expressions can be found

for example in ref.

[19]. the measure [dm]m

where k are the multipliers,  and  the xed points of the generators of the schottky

group and dvabc is the projective invariant volume element:

dvabc =

dadbdc

(a  b)(a  c)(b  c)

,

with a, b, c being any three of the m koba-nielsen variables zi, or of the 2h xed points

of the generators of the schottky group, which can be xed at will; nally, the primed

product over  denotes the product over the primary classes of elements of the schottky

group [19]. furthermore, like in any planar open string amplitude, the koba-nielsen

variables must be cyclically ordered along one of the boundaries of the world-sheet, for

example according to:

and the ordering of koba-nielsen variables automatically prescribes the one of color

z1  z2      zm

(2.6)

indices.

the presence in (2.1) of terms involving the quantity v i (0) originates from the m-

point h-loop vertex vm ;h of the operator formalism [1]. this can be regarded as a gener-

ating functional for scattering amplitudes among arbitrary states, at all orders in pertur-
bation theory. in fact, by saturating the operator vm ;h with m states |1 >, . . . ,|m >,
one obtains the corresponding amplitude:

a(h)(1,   , m ) = vm ;h|1 > . . .|m > .

(2.7)

the explicit expression of vm ;h for planar diagrams of the open string depends on m

real koba-nielsen variables zi through m projective transformations vi(z), which dene

local coordinate systems vanishing around each zi, i.e. such that:

vi(0) = zi .

(2.8)

when vm ;h is saturated with m physical string states satisfying the mass-shell con-

dition, the corresponding amplitude does not depend on the vis. such a dependence

remains for o-shell string amplitudes and for these it is therefore necessary to make a

5

choice of the projective transformations vis [6] [11]. it has been shown that a princi-

ple guiding such a choice is the requirement of projective invariance of o-shell string

amplitudes [20].

let us denote by |p > a state representing a tachyon with momentum p. it is created

by the vertex operator

v (z) = nt : ei2px(z) :

(2.9)

where colons denote the standard normal ordering on the modes of the open string coor-
dinate x(z) and nt is a normalization factor [11]:

nt = 2gs(2)

then the tachyon state is

(3.2)

where z1, z2 and z4 have been respectively xed at +, 1 and 0.

in the limit   0 the amplitude in eq. (3.2) yields the tree level feynman diagrams
of scalar eld theories: dierent regions in moduli space lead to dierent eld theory

diagrams. in fact, according to the corner of moduli space where the low-energy limit is

performed, one can recover, for instance, 3- or 4-scalar diagrams.

in order to understand which regions in moduli space lead to the dierent eld the-

ory diagrams, one can use the so-called sewing and cutting procedure. this consists in

starting from a string diagram and in cutting it in three-point vertices; next we x the
legs of each three-point vertex at +, 1 and 0. then we reconnect the diagram by
inserting between two three-point vertices a suitable propagator acting as a well specied

projective transformation. this is chosen in such a way that its xed points are just the

koba-nielsen variables of the two legs that have to be sewn. the geometric role of the

propagator is to identify the local coordinate systems dened around the punctures to

be sewn.

for illustrating in a simple case how this technique works, we show how the four-point

tree diagrams of 3-theory can be generated. the starting point is the four-tachyon tree

7

string diagram. this can be obtained by sewing two three-point vertices as shown in fig.

(2). we sew the leg corresponding to the point 0 in the vertex at the left hand in fig.
(2a) to the leg corresponding to the point + in the one at the right hand through a
propagator corresponding to the projective transformation

s(z) = az

(3.3)

which has 0 and + as xed points and the parameter a, with 0  a  1, as multiplier.
performing the sewing means, in this procedure, to transform only the punctures of the

three-point vertex at the right hand in fig. (2a) through (3.3), hence the puncture z3 = 1

transforms into s(1) = a while the other two punctures remain unchanged.

in general, after the sewing has been performed, the koba-nielsen variables become

functions of the parameter a appearing in the projective transformation (3.3).

it is

possible to give a simple geometric interpretation to this parameter, if a correspondence is

established between the projective transformation in eq. (3.3) and the string propagator,

written in terms of the operator e (l01). the latter indeed propagates an open string

through imaginary time  and creates a strip of length  . in fact the change of variable

z = e allows the string propagator to be written as

and to establish the following relation between  and a:

 = loga.

(3.5)

the multiplier a results to be therefore related to the length of the strip connecting

two three-vertices.

on the other hand, since we want to reproduce 3-theory diagrams we have to consider

a low-energy limit of string amplitudes in which only tachyons propagate as intermediate

states. this is achieved observing from (3.4) that the only surviving contribution in the
limit   0 with   kept xed is the one coming from the level n = 0, i.e.
tachyons with xed mass given by m2 =  1
 . it is obvious that this also corresponds to
the limit    and hence, from (3.5), to a  0. from these considerations it seems
natural to introduce the variable x =   in terms of which the string propagator (3.4),

from

reproduces, in the above mentioned limit, the scalar propagator

with x being interpreted as the schwinger proper time.

from a geometrical point of view, one can imagine that the the strip connecting the

two three-vertices, in this eld theory limit, becomes very long and thin, so that only

the lightest states propagate.

let us now rewrite the amplitude (3.2) in terms of the schwinger parameter x or,

equivalently, in terms of the multiplier a:

(1  z)2p2p3z2p3p4 = b [2p2  p3 + 1, 2p3  p4 + 1]

(3.12)

obtained by the sewing and cutting procedure as it is shown in fig. (3).

having 1 and + as xed points and which transforms the puncture z3 = 0 of the upper

3.2 tree scalar 4-diagrams from string amplitudes

the starting point is also in this case the amplitude (3.1) that, from (2.1), can be ex-
pressed also in terms of the green functions g(0)(zi, zj), dened on the world-sheet in the
following way:

g(0)(zi, zj) = log (zi  zj)

11

(3.16)

our aim is now to consider a suitable limit of the string four-tachyon amplitude which

can reproduce the diagram corresponding to the tree four-point vertex of 4-theory. with

reference again to the fig. (2), this diagram has to correspond to a limit in which the

length of the tube connecting the two three-vertices composing the string diagram goes
to zero in the limit   0, i.e.

 =

x


= loga  0

this corresponds to the limit a  1, and hence z  1 or, equivalently, z3  z2.

in this limit the green function g(0)(z2, z3) is divergent. we regularize it by introduc-

ing a cut-o  on the world-sheet so that

lim

we consider therefore the amplitude a(0)

we would like now to stress that if we want to reproduce diagrams of scalar eld

amplitudes.

in fact this condition is fullled if small values of the multiplier k are

considered:

indeed this parameter plays exactly the same role as the multiplier a in

the tree level amplitudes. therefore an expansion in powers of k is performed keeping

figure 7: sewing for the candy diagram

the diagram relative to this amplitude can be obtained by means of the sewing

procedure illustrated in fig. 7.

the four-particle vertices of the candy diagram can be generated by the corner of the
moduli space where the koba-nielsen variables z1  z2 and z3  z4. this is performed
by considering the limit in which the multipliers bi (i = 1, 2)  1. we stress here that,
in this limit, the green functions g(z1, z2) and g(z3, z4) result to be divergent and we
regularize them by introducing a cut-o  on the world-sheet so that bi = 1  . in this
limit the length of the strips connecting the three-vertices become very short and in this

way the four-particle vertices of the diagram in consideration are generated. furthermore,

in order to select in the loop only the lightest states, we also take the limit in which the
multiplier a  0, and, after having performed both the limits, we send the cut-o to
zero in all the regular expressions.

from these geometrical considerations that shed light on the dierent roles played

by the multipliers a-like and b-like, we select the following corner of the moduli space

reproducing the candy diagram of 4-theory:

a  0

bi = 1    1

(4.7)

let us now evaluate the amplitude (4.6) in the corner (4.7).

the rst step consists in rewriting, in this region of the moduli space, the measure

16

and the integration region in the amplitude (4.6).

the ordering of the koba-nielsen variables determines the integration regions of the

multipliers a and bi in terms of which the whole amplitude is expressed, after the sewing.

more precisely, in the limits (4.7), one gets:

d z2

z2 z z2

z3 z z3

(4.8)

for this diagram, the proper times associated to the single propagators in the loop,

are identied with the schwinger parameters

t1 =  log k/a

t2 =  log a

(4.9)

where k has to be understood as the proper time of the whole loop.

the green functions dened in (4.3), in this limit, simplify as follows:

2g(z1, z2) = 2 log  ,
2g(z3, z4) = 2 log  ,
2g(z1, z3) = 2g(z1, z4) = 2g(z2, z3) = 2g(z2, z4) ,
2g(z1, z3) =  log a 

.

( log a)2
 log k

(4.10)

in particular the green function 2g(z1, z3), when written in terms of the schwinger

parameters, becomes

2g(z1, z3) = t2 

2

t2

t1 + t2

.

by expressing the full amplitude in terms of t1 and t2 one gets:

once again we have the right result in eld theory by using the matching condition

5 two-loop 4-diagrams from string amplitudes

5.1 sunset-diagram

in this subsection we study the eld theory limit of the two-tachyon two-loop amplitude.

it is obtained through the general expression (2.1) considered for m = h = 2:

a(2)

2 (p1, p2) = n 2t r [a1a2] c2n 2

where the two-loop expressions for v 

i (0) are given by [11]:

zi  b(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

with a and b depending on the position of zi and being the two xed points on the left

and on the right hand of zi.

for this amplitude we would like to select the regions of moduli space that, in the

eld theory limit, reproduce the scalar diagrams of 4 theory, in particular in this section

we consider the sunset-diagram, depicted in fig. (8).

figure 8: sunset diagram

also in this case, the rst step consists in making a limit that could select the tachyon

particles in the internal string loop. this is achieved considering the amplitude in the

limit of small multipliers k and keeping the most divergent contribution.

in this limit the various expressions appearing in the amplitude take a very simple

form. in particular, the green functions become [11]

18

g(2)(zi, zj) = log(zi  zj) +

with

log2 ti j log k2 + log2 ui j log k1  2 log ti j log ui j log s

(5.4)

the measure, once used the projective invariance to x z1 = 1, 2 = + and 2 = 0,

becomes:

where the period matrix , in the limit of small multipliers, is given by:

(5.5)

(5.6)

det(i ) =

1

42 hlog k1 log k2  log2 si .

the second step consists in selecting the regions of moduli that, in the eld theory

limit, reproduce the sunset-diagram of 4 scalar theory. we cut the two-loop string

diagram in all possible three-vertices, as shown in fig.
(5.14). again, by using the
projective invariance, we x the legs of the all three vertices at +, 1, 0 and we sew
them using suitable projective transformation having as xed points the values of the

legs we are sewing.

in the case we are here considering we only need the following transformation

s(z) = a z

and

s(z) = bi z

with i = 1, 2.

at the end of this procedure we reach the conguration depicted in fig. (9b), i.e.:

z1 = 1

z2 = ab1b2

2 = +

figure 9: sewing for the sunset diagram

from (5.7) we see that the limits to take into account for having the quartic vertices
of the sunset, are the ones in which z2  1 and z1  1. they are simply realized
considering a conguration in which the bis are close to 1, which, in our regularization
scheme, means to introduce a cut-o on the world sheet, such that bi = 1  .

furthermore, in order to select scalars in the other sewn legs, we also perform the

limit a  0.

in this corner of moduli space we have the following ordering:

2 = +  z1 = 1 > 1  1 > z2  2 = 0.

and let us now evaluate the amplitude in this corner.

the green function g(z1, z2), dened in (5.3), takes the following form:

g(z1 , z2)  2

(5.9)

(5.10)

in our eld theory limit we integrate a-like variables on the lower boundary of the

integration region and b-like variables in the whole integration region of the multipliers,

i.e. [0, 1], as already done in the tree level case.

the schwinger parameters of the eld theory diagram are related, as explained in the

previous sections, to the proper times of the propagators used in the sewing. in this case

we get:



t1 = 

log a

ti = 



log

k1
a

(5.11)

with i = 2, 3. expressing the whole amplitudes in terms of these parameters, we rewrite

the exponential involving the green function as:

qv 

1 (0)v 

and the measure

(5.13)

in the expression of the measure it appears an explicit dependence on the cut-o ,

that disappears in our regularization scheme. finally, by inserting these expressions in

the amplitude (5.1) and writing explicitly the values of the normalization constants we

get:

this expression, once the matching condition (3.21) is used, is coincident, including

the overall factor, with the corresponding one obtained in eld theory starting from the

action (3.20).

figure 10: double-candy

in this subsection we show how to get the double-candy diagram of 4 theory, fig.

(10), starting from the two-loop four-tachyon amplitude in bosonic string theory.

the starting point is again the master formula (2.1) with m = 4 and h = 2:

qv 

i (0) v

(5.15)

where the expressions for v 

i (0) are given by (5.2).

as in the case of the sunset-diagram, we expand the previous amplitude for small

values of the multipliers k keeping the most divergent contribution that is the one

corresponding to the tachyon state and again the green functions reduce to the form

given in (5.3).

the measure, once used the projective invariance to x z4 = 1, 2 = + and 2 = 0,

becomes:

(1  1)2 [det (i )]d/2

(5.16)

where the period matrix  in the limit of small multipliers is given by eq. (5.6).

22

let us now identify the corner of the moduli space that, in the eld theory limit,

reproduces the two-loop candy diagram, according to our procedure.

in fig. (11) it

is shown the nal conguration that we reach applying the sewing procedure with the

following projective transformations:

si = bi z

s1 = a1 z

s2 = a2 z

(5.17)

with i = 1, 2, 3.

once the sewing procedure is completed, the koba-nielsen variables and the moduli

of the surface, are expressed in terms of the multiplier of the transformations. for the

sewing conguration shown in fig.

(5.1) we get the following correspondence among

multipliers, koba-nielsen variables and moduli:

2 = 

2 = 0

1 = b1b2a1

1 = (1  a2)a1b1

z1 = a1b1

z2 = [1  a2(1  b3)] a1b1

z4 = 1

z3 = b1

(5.18)

again, if we want to obtain the four-particle vertices peculiar of the two-loop candy

diagram, we have to take in consideration the corner of the koba-nielsen variables char-
acterized by z1  z2, z3  z4 and by the modulo 1  1. this conguration is achieved
considering the limits in which bi  1 and introducing the suitable regularizators, when
necessary.

furthermore, considering also the limit ai  0, we select scalar particles in the other

internal legs.

the corner of moduli space reproducing the 4 scalar diagram illustrated in fig. 5.1

is

ai  0

bi = 1   .

(5.19)

let us now evaluate the amplitude (5.15) in this corner.

23

the green functions (5.3) in the limit (5.19) take the simple form:





















g (z1, z3) = 
g (z1, z4) = 
( log a2)2
1
 log k1 
g(z1, z3) =

g (z1, z2)

g (z2, z3) =

as regards the integration region, we observe that the sewing procedure determines an

ordering of the koba-nielsen variables and of the xed points. in the case in consideration

here we get in fact the following ordering:

2 = +  z4 = 1  z3 = b1  z1 = a1b1  1 = b2 a1b1  2 = 0

and

z1  z2 = [1  a2(1  b3)] a1b1 > 1 = (1  a2)a1b1 .

in the eld theory limit (5.19) we integrate the multipliers b-like between 0 and 1

and the multipliers a-like, between 0 and  being , a positive innitesimal quantity.

where a sum over inequivalent permutations of the external particles has been done

analogously as in the one-loop candy-diagram case.

now using the matching condition (3.21), we get the same result, including the overall

factor, as the one obtained in eld theory.

in conclusion, we have used the sewing and cutting procedure in order to show how

4-theory diagrams can be reproduced from string amplitudes, up to two loop-order.

the whole information so obtained can be in principle extendible to yang-mills diagrams

involving quartic interactions.
