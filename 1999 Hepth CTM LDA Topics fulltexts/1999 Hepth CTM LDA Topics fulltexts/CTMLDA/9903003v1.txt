abstract: we discuss the eld theory limit of dp-branes. in this limit, the black dp-
brane solution approaches a solution which is conformal to adsp+2  s8p. we argue that
the frame in which the conformal factor is equal to one, the dual frame, is a holographic
frame. the radial coordinate of adsp+2 provides a uv/ir connection as in the case of the
d3 brane. the gravitational description involves gauged supergravities, typically with
non-compact gauged groups. the near-horizon dp-brane solution becomes a domain-wall
solution of the latter.

holography[1] states that a gravitational system in d + 1-dimensions should have a
description in terms of a d-dimensional (boundary) eld theory. in addition, the boundary
theory should not contain more than one degree of freedom per planck area. the ads/cft
duality[2, 3, 4] provides an example of such holographic connection[4, 5]. for instance,
anti-de sitter supergravity in ve dimensions has a description in terms of (strongly
coupled) n = 4 su(n) sym theory in four dimensions. this duality was inferred by
looking at two descriptions of the d3 brane: one as a black d3 brane and another as a
hypersurface where strings can end. taking the eld theory limit, i.e. the limit in which
the bulk gravity decouples, one nds that the worldvolume theory is equivalent to strings
propagating in the near-horizon limit of the black d3 brane which is ads5  s5. when
curvatures are small the ym coupling constant is strong and we obtain that anti-de sitter
supergravity is equivalent to strongly coupled sym theory.

it is natural to consider the same limit for the other branes as well. the dierence
between the d3 brane and the other branes is that the worldvolume theory of the latter is
not conformal. therefore, the dual supergravity cannot be anti-de sitter supergravity. by
holography we expect that when the ym coupling constant becomes large a gravitational
description in one dimension higher takes over. indeed we will see that this is the case[6]:
the gravity description is in terms of certain gauged supergravities in p + 2 dimensions,
typically with non-compact gauge groups, which possess supersymmetric domain-wall
vacua. these domain-wall vacua are spacetimes conformal to adsp+2 (for p = 5 we get
e(1,6) instead).

let us consider the eld theory limit [2, 7] of d-branes. we want to consider a limit
in which the bulk gravity decouples and we left with a decoupled worldvolume theory.
to decouple closed string loop eects we send gs  0. to suppress higher dimension
operators we go to low energies,   0. this implies that the gravitational coupling

constant, i.e. newtons constant gn  4g2
s , is also sent to zero, and therefore gravity
decouples (there are subtleties with the decoupling limit in the case of d6 branes that we
do not discuss here). we want to take the limit in such way that there is still a non-trivial
worldvolume theory. since the worldvolume dynamics are due to open strings, we keep
the masses of stretched strings, u = r/, xed as we go to low energies. in addition, we
keep g2
y m  gs(p3)/2 is the ym coupling constant. we choose to
include a factor of n because the open string coupling includes a factor of n (since strings
can end in any of the n dp-branes). in addition, it is g2
y m n that appears naturally in
the gravitational description. to summarize, we consider the limit

y m n xed, where g2

gs  0,

  0,

u =

r
 = xed,

g2
y m n = xed

(1)

this means that gsn  0 for p < 3, gsn=xed for p=3 and gsn   for p > 3.
the solution that describes a black dp-brane, in the string frame, is given by

st = h 1/2ds2(e(p,1)) + h 1/2ds2(e(9p))]

ds2
e = gsh (3p)/4,
f8p = g1
s  dh,

where  is the hodge dual of e(9p) and h = 1 + gsn(/r)(7p).

in the limit (1) the harmonic function tends to

h = 1 +

by holography we expect that in this limit the geometry would factorize into a (8  p)
compact manifold times a solution of p + 2-dimensional supergravity. inserting (3) into
(2), however, we nd that this is not the case. moreover, the resulting solution is singular.
a closer look at the solution reveals that it is conformal to adsp+2  s8p[8, 6] (except
for p = 5 in which case one gets e(1,6)  s3). therefore, the problems mentioned above
are due to improper choice of frame. the frame in which the solution becomes exactly
adsp+2  s8p is the so-called dual-frame. this is dened[9] as the frame in which the
dual eld strength f8p couples to the dilaton the same way as the metric. this means
that the dual metric is related to the string metric as

in this frame the relevant part of the action is

the metric is that of adsp+2  s8p.
the dual frame may be considered as a holographic frame since it is in this frame
that the black dp-brane solution immediately leads, in the decoupling limit, to a p + 2
gravitational description. furthermore, as we now show the area of each horosphere (i.e. a
hypersurface of constant u) in planck units is equal to the entropy of the non-extremal dp-
brane at temperature u. let us compactify the spatial coordinates of a given horosphere
u on a p torus of side l. then the area of a horosphere in planck units is equal (up to
numerical factors) to

s 

a
gn  uplpn 2(ne) = n 2lp(g2

y m n)(p3)/(5p)u(9p)/(5p)

(8)

this is exactly the entropy of non-extremal dp-branes at temperature t = u[10]. in other
words, the position of the horosphere is the uv cut-o of the worldvolume theory. the
fact that the relation u2 = u 5p/g2
y m n provides a holographic energy/distance relation
for the non-conformal cases was rst derived in [11] (generalizing the analysis of [5] for the
d3 brane). here we see that the dual frame formulation provides a uniform treatment.

the eective coupling of the eld theory is given by the dimensionless combination of
the yang-mills coupling constant g2
y m with the energy scale of the problem. therefore,
for the theory living on a horosphere it is equal to g2
y m nup3. this can be
rewritten in terms of dual-frame variables in a quite suggestive way. from (4) we see that
d = (ne)2/(p7).
d  l2
the string length as measured in the dual frame is equal to 
let us also dene the dual ym-coupling constant to be equal to (gd
d)(p3)/2.

where ud is the energy u of the d-brane probe in dual-frame units, i.e. ud = u(ld/ls)
(notice that ud 6= u).
in the dual frame, strings move in a background of constant curvature of order 1/.
however, the string tension is now variable, td  1/
d. worldsheet perturbation theory
is valid when the string tension times the curvature radius (squared) is large. this leads
to the condition g2
y m nu p3 >> 1. for the gauge theory description to be valid we need
the eective coupling to be small. this implies [g2
y m nu](5p) << 1. these conditions
are the same as in [11], so their analysis carries over. string perturbation theory is valid
when the dilaton is small. this is always true in the large n limit, except near u = 0 for
p < 3 and p = 6 or u =  for p = 4.
since the solution (7) factorizes one can immediately infer the existence of a lower-
dimensional gauged supergravity. the bosonic part of the action can be easily obtained
by reducing over the s8p. the fermionic part can also be obtained in this manner. it
is easier, however, to use the symmetries of the conguration in order to identify the
lower-dimensional gauged supergravity. here we briey summarize the results, referring
to [6] for a case-by-case discussion. for p = 0, 1 we either nd a known supergravity
or our analysis implies the existence of certain gauged supergravity (in d = 2, 3 there
is no classication of gauged supergravities). in the case the brane is related to one of
the conformal branes (i.e. d3, m2, m5) by dimensional reduction (as for instance for
d2) one obtains a gauged supergravity of the type studied in [12]. the gauge group is
a contraction of the gauge group of the supergravity that corresponds to the conformal
brane. the d6 brane yields the d = 8 gauged supergravity of [13].
in all cases, the
near-horizon dp-brane solution becomes one of the domain-wall solutions studied in [14].

we nish with a brief discussion of the eld theory limit of d-instantons[15]. this case
is of particular interest because the corresponding 0-dimensional gauge theory has been
conjectured to give a non-perturbative denition of type iib superstrings [16]. we nd
that in the eld theory limit the string frame metric of d-intantons becomes at, but for
nite n the solution preserves only 1/2 of maximal supersymmetry. in the n   limit
with g2
y m n nite, however, one obtains iib strings in at space with vanishing string
coupling constant. this is in agreement with [16].
