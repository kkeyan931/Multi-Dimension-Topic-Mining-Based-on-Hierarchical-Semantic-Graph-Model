1 introduction

superconformal algebras have been studied for a long time in physical literature. the importance
is above all due to the fact that the superconformal algebra describes the underling symmetries of
superstring theory. a superconformal algebra is a simple lie superalgebra (over ic) spanned by
modes of a nite family of local elds, which contains the virasoro and some other odd , even ones,
such that the coecients of the operator product expansions are linear combinations of elds in the
family and their derivatives. this innite-dimensional algebra possesses a very rich mathematical
structure with vast applications on dierent branches in physics and mathematics. nevertheless,
only until recent years, some rigorously systematic study of conformal superalgebras from the
mathematical point of view has been worked out by groups of mathematicians and physicists, and
profound mathematical structures have been found to further enhance our understanding of the
original physical content (see, for instance [8, 13, 20] and references therein). however, despite the
many theories of conformal algebras, the n=2 conformal theory has a peculiar nature which denes
a class of its own, other than due to its applicable physical contents of the theory (see [4, 5, 6]
references therein), also the mathematical reason on the intimate relation of special features of the
n=2 superalgebra with kahler geometry which has been a main core in the analytical study of
projective algebraic manifolds. hence it would be expected that one of the important aspects of
n=2 conformal theory will be on the geometrical understanding of complex manifolds, especially
the application on their topological invariants. a notable example would be the elliptic genus of
c1 = 0 manifolds, (see for instance [14, 21] and references therein), which amounts to the so called
gepner-model construction of the rational conformal theory [9]. as the mathematical structure
of elliptic genus has now been well understood by works of the hirzebruch school [11, 12], it is
expected that a rigorous treatment of this topological invariant in terms of the n=2 conformal
theory would be appeared as, or in a further complete form than, the one given in [18]. however,
due to the length of presentation and also the nature of the contents, in this paper we shall only
discuss the representation-theoretical aspect of the n=2 conformal algebra and leave its application
on topology of manifolds as a separate problem, which will be treated in another work [19]. in
this note, we shall study both the quantitative and qualitative properties of character functions
of the rational n=2 conformal theory. the unitary n= 2 superconformal characters have been
analyzed by several groups of physicists [1, 3, 15, 16, 17]. while working on characters, they
are usually regarded as the formal laurent series; however a proper theta-form expression of the
character is expected for the discussion of symmetries among the characters. by incorporating the
characteristic of theta functions into the twisted currents of the algebra, we obtain a theta function
(with characteristic) presentation of the characters of unitary irreducible highest weight modules
(hwm) of n=2 conformal algebra for dierent sectors, (see theorem 1 of the content). these
explicit forms of characters in terms of the theta function, which seem to be unknown before to
the best of the authors knowledge, do provide a convenient formulation for discussing the global
functional properties through the classical elliptic function theory. deceptively simple as it may
appear, this is an crucial observation since it implies that in this form, the symmetries between
characters of the rational n=2 conformal theory for a xed central charge are clearly revealed and
the later applications are expected to achieve in the study of the geometry of manifolds.

the paper is organized as follows.

in sect. 2, we give a brief introduction of the elliptic,
modular functional properties of the heisenberg and modular transformations. we also summarize
a few known facts about the jacobi-form like nature of theta functions (with characteristic) in
the elliptic function theory.
in sect. 3, we rst summarize some basic facts about the n=2
conformal algebra and the discrete series of unitary irreducible hwm with the central charge
c < 3. then we derive the theta form representation of characters of these hwm for all dierent

2

sectors, which enables us to further pursue their qualitative functional properties, instead of using
only the laurent series expression. in sect. 4, we study the symmetries among these characters of
hwm in the discrete series with a xed central element. with the elliptic and modular properties,
the characters constitute an irreducible representation of a central extension of some jacobi-group,
which composes of a nite heisenberg group and a certain modular group. we consider this part as
one of the most delicate aspects of this paper. for this reason we describe, as precisely as possible,
the procedure of constructing the irreducible decomposition of heisenberg group with a certain
explicit basis, by which a matrix realization of modular transformations is given and the modular
action on the irreducible heisenberg-submodules is clearly shown. the detailed description will be
stated in theorem 2 of the paper. finally, as it is known ( cf., for instance [10] and references
therein, ) that superconformal algebras have a certain geometrical superspace realization in which
generators are presented as super-vector elds (i.e., derivations) of super-spacetime. a such kind
of geometrization for the usual virasoro algebra has been a well-known process, by which the
symmetry content of the algebra is better revealed. hence in the last section as an appendix, we in
particular recall and describe a detailed account of a geometrical realization of the n=2 conformal
algebra as 1-dimensional vector elds with 2 supersymmetric extensions. this geometrical setting
might oer a means of realizing the superconformal symmetry, which has been the focus of the
present work.

convention . in this paper, ir, ic will denote the eld of real, complex numbers respectively,
and ih the upper half plane {  ic | im > 0}; ir = ir  {0}, ic = ic  {0}. by a representation
of a group g on a (complex) vector space v , we shall always mean a linear right-action of g on v ,

r : v  g  v ,

(v, g) 7 v  g := r(v, g) .

a r-eigenvector with the eigen-character  is an element v  v satisfying the relation:

v  g = (g)v , g  g .

2 elliptic and modular functional properties

denote o( ic  ih) the vector space of holomorphic functions of ic  ih. in this section, we shall
give a brief review on some basic elliptic and modular functional properties of ic ih, which will be
needed for our later discussions. here the ellipticity and modularity we refer to are the following
standard actions of ir2, sl2(ir) on ic  ih respectively,

ir2  ( ic  ih)  ic  ih ,
sl2(ir)  ( ic  ih)  ic  ih,

(v, (z,  )) 7 (z + v1 + v2,  ), v = (v1, v2) ,
c +d ) , m =  a b
(m, (z,  )) 7 (

c +d , a +b

z

c d ! .

for the convenience of notations, in this section the letters, v1, v2, will always denote the coordinates
of a vector v in ir2; a, b, c, d are the entries of a matrix m of sl2(ir). denote ir2  sl2(ir)
the semi-product of ir2 and sl2(ir) where the conjugation of m  sl2(ir) on v  ir2 is given by
m1  v  m = vm (the matrix product). the above expressions give rise to a geometrical action
of ir2  sl2(ir) on ic  ih. one would like to lift this geometrical action to one on o( ic  ih). the
elliptic part is as follows. let (ir2, <, >) be the skew-symmetric form, < v, v >:= v1v2  v2v1 for
lg(d) = ic1  ir2 is the heisenberg
v, v  ir2, and denote ic1 = {  ic | || = 1}. for d  ir,
group (of index d) with the group law,

(, v)  (, v) = (e2d1v2v1 , v + v) ,

for ,   ic1 , v, v  ir2 .

3

we shall regard ic1, ir2 as the subsets of lg(d) by the following identication of elements,

ic1   := (, 0)  lg(d) ,

ir2  v := (1, v)  lg(d) .

then lg(d) is generated by elements of ir2 with the relations,

v  v = e2d1<v,v>v  v = e2d1v2v1(v + v)  lg(d) ,

for v, v  ir2.

as a character of lg(d) is always trivial on its center, the character-group of lg(d) is parametrized
by the additive group ir2, of which an element r corresponds the character r of lg(d) with r(v) :=

e2d1<v,r> for v  ir2  lg(d). we shall denote (d) the subgroup of lg(d) generated by integral

elements in ir2. when d is an integer, (d) is the abelian lattice group zz2, which will be denoted
by  in what follows. associated to an element  of the upper half-plane ih, there is a lg(d)-
representation t ( ; d) on the space of entire functions of ic,

t (= t ( ; d)) : o( ic)  lg(d)  o( ic) ,

(, (, v)) 7 |t(,v) := (|tv) ,

where (|tv)(z) := ed1(v2

following relations hold,

1  +2v1(z+v2))(z + v1 + v2) for v  ir2, z  ic.

in particular, the

(|t(v1,0))(z) = ed1(v2

t(v1,v2) = t(v1,0)t(0,v2) ,
(|t(0,v2))(z) = (z + v2) .
for r  ir2, the multiplication of the character r on t gives rise to a lg(d)-representation t r(=
t r( ; d)) on o( ic),

1  +2v1z)(z + v1 ) ,

v )(z) = e21d<v,r>(|tv)(z) = ed1(v2

(|t r
 = ttr, t r is equivalent to t via the intertwining operator tr. for d  ir, r  ir2 and

1 +2v1(z+v2)+2<v,r>)(z + v1 + v2) .

by trt r
  o( ic  ih), we shall denote

|t r(= |t r(d)) := (,  )|t r( ; d)  o( ic  ih) .

(1)

the usual theta function theory is referred to the case d = 1. recall the theta function (z,  ) is
an element in o( ic  ih) with the innite product representation

(z,  ) =

(1 + 2qn 1

2 cos 2z + q2n1)(1  qn) , q = e21 ,

yn=1

im( )  0 ,

while the theta function with characteristics r = (a, b)  ir2 is dened by 2

r(z,  ) := e1(a2 +2a(z+b))(z + a + b,  ),

(z,  )  ic  ih .

for a xed  , (z,  ) ( or r(z,  ) ) is the only -invariant entire function on ic, up to a constant
multiple, for the action t (1) ( t r(1) resp.) . in fact, one has the following expression of the theta
functions,

(z,  ) = (1|pm= t(m,0)(1))(z,  )
r(z,  ) = ((1|t r

r (1))|pm= t r

=pm= ei(m2 +2mz) ,

(m,0)(1))(z,  ) =pm= e1((m+a)2 +2(m+a)(z+b)) ,

2here we write the theta function (a,b) instead of [

] in usual literature.

, r(z,  ) =

r(z,  )
( )3  o( ic  ih) ,

where ( ) (= q1/24qn=1(1  qn)) is the dedekind eta function. the following relation holds,

(a,b)(z,  ) = e1(a2 +2a(z+))(z + a + b,  ),

(z,  )  ic  ih .

corresponding to jacobi theta function 1(z,  ) (:= ( 1

2 , 1

2 )(z,  )), we have the jacobi-form

1(z,  ) := ( 1

2 , 1

2 )(z,  ) .

it is known that the asymptotic expansion of 1(z,  ) near z = 0 is given by

we have the quasi-periodicity and zero relations for (a,b)(z,  ),

1(z,  ) = 2z + o(z2)

as z  0 .

(a,b)(z + 1,  ) = e2ia(a,b)(z,  ), (a,b)(z + ,  ) = e1( +2(z+b))(a,b)(z,  ),

one has

(a+1,b)(z,  ) = (a,b)(z,  ) , (a,b+1)(z,  ) = e21a(a,b)(z,  ) ,
(a,b)(z,  ) = e21a(1a,1b)(z,  ) ,
(a+a,b+b)(z,  ) = e1(a2 +2a(z+b+b))(a,b)(z + a + b,  ) .

by lifting of the geometrical modular action, we have a sl2(ir)-representation on o( ic  ih) for
each pair (w, d) with w  1

the relation of the elliptic and modular actions on o( ic  ih) is given by the following lemma.
lemma 1. for (w, d)  1
relation holds for m  sl2(ir), v, v  ir2 with v = vm , and for   o( ic  ih):

2 zz  ir, we denote t r = t r(d),  = (w, d). then the following

ed1(v1v2+2<v,r>)(|m )|t r

v = ed1(v1v2+2<v,r>)(|t r

v)|m .

proof. by the denition of t r, one needs only to consider the case r = 0. note that v1 =
v1a + v2c, v2 = v1b + v2d. by computation, one has the following relations:
(c + d)w((|tv )|m )(z,  ) = ed1 cz2+2v1
(c + d)w((|m )|tv)(z,  ) = ed1( cz2+2v1

the conclusion of the above lemma has indicated that one can not lift the geometric action of
ir2  sl2(ir) of ic ih directly to one of o( ic ih). however, the formulas (1),(5) do give rise to a

the group lg(d)

 sl2(ir) of lg(d) and sl2(ir). here in
 sl2(ir), the conjugate relation of m  sl2(ir) on v  ir2  lg(d) is dened by
(6)

m  v  m1 = ed1(v1v2v1v2+2<vv,r>)v(= ed1((v12a)(v2+2b)(v12a)(v2+2b))v) ,

where v = (v1, v2) is the (matrix-product) element vm1. note that lg(d)
 sl2(ir) is a central
extension of ir2  sl2(ir) with its center contained in lg(d). hence we have obtained the following
result:

for the rest of this section, we shall only consider the case d  zz, in which situation one will
see that the representation (7) does descend to a certain arithmetic subgroup of ir2  sl2(ir).
denote  the full modular group,  = sl2(zz). the subgroup j :=    of ir2  sl2(ir) is
called the jacobi group. in general, the jacobi group associated to a subgroup  of  is dened
by j :=   . it is easy to see that the following elements generates j,
0 1 ! , s =  0

u = (1, 0), v = (0, 1)  zz2 , t =  1 1

1 0 !  .

in fact, j is characterized as the group generated by four elements u, v, t, s, with the relations,

uv = vu ,
t1ut = u + v , t1vt = v , s1us = v , s1vs = u1 .

s2t = ts2 ,

s4 = 1 ,

one can easily see that a character  of j is always trivial on the subgroup , hence determined
by the values of (t), (s). besides the full modular group , the modular groups we shall also
concern in this paper are the following one for q = (q1, q2)  iq2,

q := {m   | qm  q  } (= {m   | e21<vmv,q> = 1  v  }) .

note that q depends only on the class of q in iq2/. the modular group ( 1
, t2, which was denoted by  in [18].

2 ) is generated by s

2 , 1

proposition 2. associated to an element r of iq2, we denote q = ( 1

(|m (w, d))|t r

vm (d) = (|t r

v (d))|m (w, d) ,

  o( ic  ih) .

proof. since the sign (1)(m+1)(n+1) in unchanged under the action of  for (m, n)  , the above
equality holds when r = ( 1
2 ). then it follows the result for an arbitrary r by the denition of q.

remark. applying the same argument in the proof of the above proposition to the representation
(7) for d  iq, one obtains a (d)

 q-module structure of o( ic  ih). 2

r

for simplicity, we shall write |v, |m instead of |t r
v (d), |m (w, d) in the case d  zz if no
confusion could arise. by proposition 2, one obtains an jq -representation on o( ic  ih), called
the weight w and index d

in this section, we shall derive the theta-form expression of characters of n=2 superconformal
algebra representations. first we recall the some well-known facts on the algebra.

[lm, gp ] = ( m

we shall not distinguish the central element c with its eigenvalues. for convenience, we shall use
the bold letter c to denote one-third of the central element,

a highest weight module (hwm) is a sca-module generated by a highest vector, i.e., an eigenvector
of sca0 and annihilated by sca+. the letters h, q will denote the l0, j0-eigenvalues of the highest
0 -eigenvalues. then h a = h + aq +
vector respectively; similarly the letters h a, qa for la

for 0 < c < 1, all the unitary irreducible hwm of sca are labelled by three integers k, m, l with
the relations, |m|  l  k , l  m (mod 2), where c, h, q are given by

c = k

l,m (z,  ) are elements in o( ic ih) with the following

(14)

proof. by the innite product formula of (z,  ), the factors (z,  ), l,m(z,  ) in the formula of
ns(z,  ) have the following expressions:

(z,  ) = q

l,m(z,  ) =

.

k ,0)(z, k )

hence we obtain the expression of nsl,m(z,  ). by the last relation of (4), it follows the expression
of ch(a,b)

l,m (z,  ). the zeros of the denominator in the expression of ch(a,b)

l,m (z,  ) are given by

z  (i + a) +

1
2  b , (j + a) +

1
2  b

(mod. zzk + zz) .

by 0 < i  j < k, there is no common solution for the above two equations. hence the poles of
ch(a,b)
l,m (z,  ) are all simple; so are the zeros of (a,b)(z,  ) in the numerator of the expression. then
one can easily see that ch(a,b)

l,m (z,  )  o( ic  ih). 2

one obtains the following relations of ramon characters, which was used in the study of topological
elliptic genus [6, 18]

10

corollary 1.5

rl,m(z,  ) = erl,m(z,  ) ,
rl,m(z,  ) = ec1(2z+1)rl,m(z    1,  ) ,
rl,m(z,  ) = ec1( +2z+1)rl,m(z    1,  ) ,
rl,m(0,  ) =( (1)ql,m+ c
erl,m(0,  ) =( (1)ql,m+ c

if m = l, i.e. chiral,
otherwise .

if m = l, i.e. antichiral ,
otherwise,

erl,m(z,  ) = rl,m(z,  ),
erl,m(z,  ) = ec1( +2z+1)erl,m(z +  + 1,  ) ,
erl,m(z,  ) = ec1(2z+1)erl,m(z +  + 1,  ) ,

for characters of other sectors, by (3) (4) and theorem 1, one has the following result.

corollary 2. the following relations hold for characters of hwms for a xed central element c:
e21ql,mch(a,b)

l,m (z,  ) = e2c1ach(a,b)

l,m2(z,  ) = ec1( +2(z+b))ch(a,b)

l,m (z+1,  ) , ch(a,b)

l,m (z+,  ) .

for the qualitative study of characters, it is more convenient to extend the domain of (l, m) to the
following larger one:

lc := {(l, m)  zz2 | 0  l  k  2, l  m (mod 2)} ( {(i, j)  (
for (l, m)  lc, one denes hl,m, ql,m, ch(a,b)

(15). the chirality now becomes,

l,m (z,  ) etc. by the same expressions in (12) (13), (14),

r : lc  lc ,

(l, m) 7 (k  2  l, m + k) ( (i, j) 7 (j, i)  (0, k) ).

denote bc be the space of < r >-orbits , vc the hilbert space with bc as an orthonormal basis,

bc = lc/ < r > ,

a fundamental region for bc consists of those (l, m) with |m|  l, i.e., the index set of hwm.
5 in the paper [18], the signs in the formula of er on pp. 373 were inaccurate in order to keep the statement of
proposition 4 there to be valid. the correct one should be er(z,  ) = n s(z 
then lemma 4 in [18] holds for r of this present paper, instead of er.

m

note that the characters and chirality thus dened are invariant under the automorphism r, i.e.,
depending only on the class of (l, m) in bc, which will be denoted by [l, m]. we denote

ch(a,b)



(z,  ) := ch(a,b)

l,m (z,  )

for  = [l, m]  bc ,

similar for ns(z,  ), r(z,  ),er(z,  ). we introduce the following automophisms of lc,

f0 : (l, m) 7 (l, m  2)
n0 : (l, m) 7 (l,m)

( (i, j) 7 (i + 1, j + 1) ) ,
( (i, j) 7 (j,i) ) .

by f0r = rf0, n0r = r1n0, the maps f0, n0 induce the one-one correspondences of bc, hence the
linear automorphisms f, n of the vector space vc with the order k, 2 respectively,

f : vc  vc ,
n : vc  vc ,

[l, m]  bc
[l, m]  bc

7 [l, m  2]  bc ,
7 [l,m]  bc .

(16)

the linear transformations f, n are called the spectral ow, the charge conjugation of vc respectively.
by corollary 1 of theorem 1, one has the following relations of ramon characters:
rn()(z,  ) = er(z,  ),
r(z,  ) = ec1(2z+1)rn()(z    1,  ),
rn()(z,  ) = ec1( +2z+1)r(z    1,  ),
by corollary 2 of theorem 1, we have the following relations of ch(a,b)
the elliptic property of characters will be discussed in the next section,
ec1( +2(z+b))ch(a,b)

ern()(z,  ) = r(z,  ),
er(z,  ) = ec1( +2z+1)ern()(z +  + 1,  ) ,
ern()(z,  ) = ec1(2z+1)er(z +  + 1,  ) .

(17)
(z,  ) for   bc, by which

(z + 1,  ) = e21qch(a,b)

f() (z,  ) , e2c1ach(a,b)

(z + ,  ) = ch(a,b)









(z,  ) ,

12

(18)

in particular, for the neveu-schwarz and ramon characters one has

ec1( +2z)ns(z + ,  ) = nsf()(z,  ) , ns(z + 1,  ) = e21qns(z,  ) ,
ec1( +2z+1)r(z + ,  ) = rf()(z,  ),

ec1r(z + 1,  ) = e21qr(z,  ) ,

ec1( +2z1)er(z + ,  ) = erf()(z,  ) ,

ec1er(z + 1,  ) = e21qer(z,  ) .

4 ellipticity and modularity of superconformal algebra repre-

(19)

sentations

in this section, we are going to discuss the symmetry properties among the unitary irreducible
hwms with a xed central element c = k2
for sca-modules. first we describe some notions
k
which will facilitate the later presentation signicantly. for a positive integer n , a vector v in icn
will be identied with a sequence of complex numbers, (vm)mzz, with vm = vm+n . the standard
basis of icn are denoted by |n >, n  zz with |n >= |m > if n  m (mod n ). denote vn , un
and u

n (  ic) as the linear automorphisms of icn dened by

vn|n >= n|n > ,
un|n >= |n + 1 > ,
n|n >=( |n + 1 > if n  0 (mod n ),
u

|n + 1 > otherwise.

here  is a primitive n -th root of unity, which we will specify later.



for a given r = (a, b), with the identication of the basis element  of vc and the character
ch(a,b)
(z,  ), the relation (18) gives rise to a (c)-representation on vc which describes the elliptic
properties of the hwms. this (c)-representation is trivial on the subgroup k of (c) which is
generated by (k, 0) and (0, k), hence it descends to a representation of the nite quotient group,
(c) := (c)/k,

for easier description of the above representation, we dene a pair of integers n, m associated to
the central element c = k2
k ,

vc  (c)  vc .

(20)

(n, m )(= (n (c), m (c)) =( (k, k1
2 )
( k
2 , k  1)

for odd k,
for even k.

denote p = (1, 0), q = (0, 1), the generators of (c), and they satisfy the weyl commutation
relation:

pq = 1qp ,

 := e21c = e

41

k

(21)

note that  is a primitive n -th root of unity. it is known that the irreducible unitary representations
of (c) are parametrized by elements (1, 2) in the (real) 2-torus ic1  ic1, where (1, 2) represents
the n -dimensional (c)-module icn
(1,2) is

2 un . note that icn

(1,2) with q 7 

1 vn , p 7 

equivalent to the representation with q 7

1 vn , p 7 u2
n .

bc =

[ k2

g=0 bc, , bc, := {[l, m]  bc | l = } .

dene vc, = bc, ic. as (c)-modules, vc is the direct sum of vc,s, each of which is k-
2 . for odd k, by (18) the (c)-representation vc, is irreducible,
dimensional except dim.vc, k2
and equivalent to icn
(1,1) for all . for even k, the irreducible decomposition of the (c)-module
vc, is given by

for the matrix realization of elliptic and modular transformations, we shall make the identication
of vector spaces, icm  icn = vc, through a canonical correspondence of the basis elements. for
odd k, the identication is made by the following relations for 0   < m, n  zz,

| > |n >=( [,2n]
[, k  2n]

for even ,
for odd .

(22)

for even k, with icm = ,=1 icm, and the standard base of icm, denoted by | >, for
0   < m,, the identication of icm  icn and vc is given by

= 1
| >1,1 |n >

for 0   < m1,1,
for 0   < m1,1,
for 0   < m1,1,
for 0   < m1,1.

(23)

note that by ( k2

2 , m + k), one has the following identities,
for  = m1,1  1 k
for  = m1,1  1 k

as an example, the identication (23 ) for k = 4 is given by

|0 >1,1 |0 >= 1
|0 >1,1 |0 >= 1
|0 >1,1 |0 >= [1, 1],

by (18), one obtains the following results.

proposition 3. with the identication (22), (23) of vc = icm  icn , the (c)-representation (20)
on characters ch(a,b)

(z,  ) has the following matrix form:

(i) for odd k, q 7 id  v1
(ii) for even k, one has the (c)-decomposition icm  icn = ,=1( icm,  icn ) with the

n , p 7 id  un .

for the discussion of the modular properties of the characters ch(a,b)

together with the elliptic action (20), the relations among characters ch(a,b)
nite dimensional representation of a group (c)

property of the subgroup k of (c),

(z,  ), the modular group is

(z,  )s give rise to a
 q through (7) for r = (a, b), d = c, w = 0. here

in particular, q is the full modular group  for the ramon characters r or er; ( 1

neveu-schwarz characters ns. in this paper, we shall only consider these two special cases, partly
due to the easy description of generators of these modular groups , but also its suciency for the
future study on topological applications of manifolds. we denote

we now describe the t, s-transforms on ramon and neveu-schwarz characters.

proof. the t-relation of r,er follows from (15) (9). by (10) for (a, b) = ( 1

2 ) and the t-relation
of ramon characters, one obtains the t2-relation of ns. the s-transform of ns was known in
literature ,( e.g., formula (28a) of [17]), which we adopt here. then, by (10), we have the relation,

2 ) in the above equality, one obtains the expression of the s-

with the identication of the basis element  of vc with the character ns or r,er, by (20),
by using proposition 4 and the remark of proposition 2, there exists a canonical jacobi-group
representation on vc for the neveu-schwarz or ramon sector,

with vc = icm icn through (22) (23), the matrix presentation of the above actions on the part (c)
is described by proposition 3. as any modular transformation sends a (c)-irreducible subspace
onto another one, we shall be able to obtain a matrix form of a modular transformation as a tensor
product of one from the icm -factor, (),, and another one from the icn -factor, (nn)n,n. by
proposition 4, t-transformation is a diagonal matrix; while the s-transform of a vector will be a
linear combination of all the basis elements. the explicit forms are given in the following theorem,
where the matrix indices , , n, n are non-negative integers less than the dimensions of vector
spaces involved in the expression,.

6 appendix: geometrical realization of n=2 conformal algebra

the geometrical representation of generators of virasoro algebra in terms of vector elds on ic has
been well-known in literature, so is the n=1 conformal algebras generators as derivations of ic with
one grassmann variable , (see for instance [2]). the super-vector eld expressions of n-extended
conformal algebra for a general n have been treated in a similar way, and its various forms could be
found in literature [10]. in this section, we are going to present a detailed geometrical realization
of the n= 2 conformal algebra so that one could have a better understanding of the symmetries
represented by this algebra. we start with an alternative denition of the n=2 conformal algebra,
whose formulation works also for an arbitrary value n,
[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n + c
[lm, gj
[lm, jn] = njm+n ,
{gj
where j, k = 1, 2, and j,k are antisymmetric with 1,2 = 1. the denition of sca in sect. 3 is
equivalent to the above one by the relations,

12 (m3  m)m+n,0 ,

p] = ( m
m+p ,
q} = 2j,klp+q + 1j,k(p  q)jp+q + c

it is easy to see that the correspondence,

dimensional lie-superalgebra g invariant under the above automorphism, the even part ge and odd

here the standard basis elements e, f, h of sl2 with [h, e] = 2e, [h, f ] = 2f, [e, f ] = h, are expressed
by

the representation of the even algebra ge on the odd space go decomposes into two copies of the
canonical 2-dimensional representation of sl2:

e = l1 , h = 2l0 , f = l1 .

in conformal eld theory, the operators f, h
, j0 are called the momentum, dilation,
special-conformal, supersymmetry, s-supersymmetry, and so(2)-charge generators. let ic1,2 be
the one dimensional superspace with the coordinate, t  ic, and the two-component grassmann
variable,  = (1, 2). the sca with c = 0 can be represented by the following super-vector elds
on ic1,2,

under the conformal transformation,

(t, ) 7 (t1,t1) ,  = (1, 2) ,

one has the relations,



t 7 t2 

t

+ tk 

k ,


j 7 t


j ,

which give rise to the automorphism (24) of sca. let ip1,2 be the one-dimensional projective
superspace, which is the union of two ane spaces u0, u with the super-coordinates:

(t, )  ic1,2  u0 ,

(t, )  ic1,2  u .

the intersection, u0  u, consists of elements with t 6= 0, or t 6= 0, with the coordinate transfor-
mation

(t, ) = (t1,t1)  ic1,2 .

we shall denote vect(m ) the space of super-vector elds of a super-manifold m . then through
(25), one can regard ln, gj

p, jn as elements in vect(u0  u), and we have

ln

(n  1),

(p  1

(p  1
jm (m  0)  vect(u)
2 ),

hence

g =< ln, jm, gj

p > ic vect(ip1,2) .

now one can clearly see the analogy of above description of n=2 conformal algebra with the usual
virasoro interpretation of vector elds on 1-dimensional projective space ip1.
