abstract

we show that it is possible to construct supersymmetric three-generation models

of standard model gauge group in the framework of non-simply-connected ellipti-

cally bered calabi-yau, without section but with a bi-section. the brations on

a cover calabi-yau, where the model has 6 generations of su (5) and the bundle

is given via the spectral cover description, use a dierent description of the ellip-

tic curve which leads to more than one global section. we present two examples:

one cover calabi-yau is a bre product of rational elliptic surfaces dp9 with con-
ventional chiral matter; another example is an elliptic bration over a hirzebruch

surface, where the bundles turn on a further parameter, related to singularities of

the bration and the branching of the spectral cover, to get chiral matter.

1 introduction

eorts to get a (supersymmetric) phenomenological spectrum from the e8  e8 het-
erotic string on a calabi-yau z started with embedding the spin connection in the gauge

connection which gave an unbroken e6 (times a hidden e8 which couples only gravi-
tationally). this procedure was combined in a second step with a further breaking of

the gauge group by turning on wilson lines using a non-trivial 1(z). the simplest
constructions of calabi-yau spaces, as hypersurfaces in toric varieties will always have

a trivial fundamental group. however one can still produce  = g by dividing z by a

freely acting group g, provided such an operation on z exists. this then led at the same

time to a reduction of the often high number of generations (being equal to (z)/2) by

the order of g.

this approach was generalised [1] to the case of embedding instead of the tangent

bundle an su(n) bundle for n = 4 or 5, leading to unbroken so(10) resp. su(5) of

even greater phenomenological interest then e6. this subject was revived when, as a
consequence of the investigation of heterotic/f -theory duality, the bundle construction

was made much more explicit for the case of elliptically bered calabi-yau  : z  b

[2]. this extended ansatz showed among other things to have a much greater exibility in

providing one with three-generation models (of the corresponding unbroken gut group)

[3].

there remains to go to the standard model gauge group in this framework4. for the

following bases one can show that the elliptic brations, we will discuss, are smooth: the

hirzebruch surfaces fm, m = 0, 1, 2, the del pezzo surfaces dpk with k = 0, ...6, the
rational elliptic surface dp9 and 10 additional examples from the list of classied [4] toric
varieties, which correspond to two dimensional reexive polyhedra. however none5 of

them has non-trivial 1(z).

the purpose of this note is to show that the elliptic framework is nevertheless capable

of providing one with a three generation model of standard model gauge group by giving
just a typical example how to proceed. namely6 we will look for an elliptically bered

calabi-yau z which has besides the usually assumed section of its elliptic bration a

4three generation models with standard model gauge group were constructed in orbifold and free

fermion models before but these are, in contrast to our models, dened only at isolated points in moduli

space.

5the enriques surface as base b has 1(b) = z2 leading to a non-trivial 1(z) but, as pointed out

by e. witten, does not lead to a three generation model (cf. [17]).

6following a suggestion of e. witten

2

second section (a construction which we will call b model in contrast to the usual form,

here called a model); this will lead to a free involution on z which after modding it out

provides you with a smooth calabi-yau where one now has the possibility of turning on

wilson lines which break su(5) to the standard model gauge group. thereby we will

have achieved our goal when we specify on z an su(5) bundle that leads to 6 generations

and fullls some further requirements of the spectral cover construction. a variant of

this procedure would be to consider a bration with two z2 operations (d model) and
to break so(10) to the standard model gauge group times u(1)bl; we will comment
on this possibility7 too.

in section 2 the spaces along with their cohomological data are introduced. in section

3 the spectral cover construction of bundles is recalled and the necessary adjustments

for our base calabi-yau as well as some consistency conditions are spelled out; nally,

there are given some examples of 6 generation models (above) for b = f1 or dp9. in
section 4 the question of modding these spaces/bundles is treated; for f0, f2 and dp9 we
succeed in writing down a free involution. up to this point we have valid examples over

dp9 only. in section 5 we point to a method to get from the changed structure of the
underlying calabi-yau a new class of bundles, which though is not capable of producing

chiral matter. finally in section 6 we turn on a further possible parameter (an option

already existent in the a model), related to singularities of the bration respectively to

the branching of the spectral cover, to generate chiral matter; here we succeed for b = f0
or f2 in giving 6 generation models.

2 the spaces

2.1 change of bre type

as it will be our goal to mod not just the calabi-yau spaces but also the geometric data

describing the bundle (and this transformation of bundle data into geometric data uses in

an essential way the elliptic bration structure) we will search only for operations which

preserve the bration structure, i.e.    =    where the  is an action on the base. this

has the consequence that our brations will have n sections for n = |g|.

to have this extra structure, which allows for free zn actions on the elliptically bered
calabi-yau we will use a dierent elliptic curve than the usually taken p1,2,3(6), which

7 we will have not use for a symmetry breaking pattern for e6 as in this case one needs at least a

z7 [5] which we do not get in our approach.

we will be interested in a global version of these descriptions over a complex surface
b so that our calabi-yau z can be described by a generalized weierstrass equation in
a p2 bundle w over b (note that in the case of the b-model the bre p2 is actually
a weighted p2,1,1 with y being a section of o(2)).

tab. 2 generic brations with a, b, c, d bre types

here we indicated also the number of cohomological inequivalent sections s.

it is

obtained by counting the solutions of the equation at the locus of the section z = 0,

taking into account the equivalence relations in the (weighted) projective spaces. e.g.
for the b-ber we get at z = 0 the equation y2 = x4, which has naively 8 solutions which

lie however only in two equivalence classes in p(2, 1, 1): [y, x] = [1, 1] and [1, 1] etc. .

note that always one of the s sections is the zero section, while the others have rank 1

in the mordell-weil group, i.e. they generate innitely many sections. for special points

in the moduli space we can bring them to torsion points of nite order s, see below.

furthermore we indicated the number of complex structure deformations d if we con-
sider an elliptically bered k3, with p1 base. then a, b, c, . . . are polynomials of order

4

2i in the p1 variables. the number of the parameters in the polynomials minus the 3 pa-
rameters of the sl(2, c) reparametrisations of the p1, minus one for the overall scaling

of all variables gives the number of independent complex structure deformations. e.g.

for the b-bre k3 we have d = 5 + 7 + 9  3  1 = 17 etc. the picard-group of the k3
is generated by the s-sections plus the base. i.e.  = s + 1 and in particular  + d = 20.

the construction of free zn actions on z will be closely connected with shift symme-
tries, which are free at least on the generic bre. the existence of the shift symmetry
implies that the n sections are at order n points ( 1
n-periods), which are xed under the
monodromy; this in turn means specialization of the complex parameters8. the follow-

ing table shows for each of the models two consecutive specializations and their ensuing

monodromy enhancements [10].

tab. 3 properties of specializations of the b, c, d-type bres

the possible degenerations of the associated weierstrass forms employing the kodaira

classication tables of singular bres are also analysed [10]. i.e. the group is 1(k) ((k))
for k = 9  j the number of the model related to ej (,i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4 for the a, b, c, d
model; cf. the euler number later). the relation to the ej classication becomes appar-
ent, if we blow up (down) a (1) curve in the base. in this case we create (or shrink) an ej
8the spaces then turn out to be singular; so this is only a rudimentary version of what we are actually

going to do.

j = 8, . . . 5 del pezzo surface [13, 8], which can be geometrically described by p3,2,1,1(6),
p2,1,1,1(4), p 3(3) and p 4(2, 2). the local singularities which have the same structure,
were analysed in [14]. we assume that elliptic brations related to ej for j < 5 with
9  j sections exist, but it is known that the associated singularities mentioned above

can not be described as complete intersections. the further specializations in the table,

as well as forms of the a-bre, which have additional sections, are singular and it is not

known whether an extremal transition leads to new bre types.

2.2 our procedure

our main goal will be to give a free zn action on z. one does not nd free operations
on the base b. therefore the operation over the x-locus in the base must be free in the

bre. but this means that it is a shift by an n-torsion point. to force the existence of

this shift we have to use actually a bration where such a shift exists globally (even if

only on a sublocus of moduli space). so clearly the rst idea in choosing the a, b, c, d

models is to use the bre shift and to enhance it to an operation in the total calabi-yau

by combining it with an operation in the base. this will be necessary for two reasons:

rst at the singular bers the pure bre operation ceases to be free, and secondly to

use just the bre operation would us restrict to the rst specialisation locus given in the
table which is singular9. for example in the b model the involution (y, x)  (y, x) in

the coordinates (which for b = 0 is identical to the shift provided by the second section,

which is then an involution) does not necessarily restrict us to the b = 0 locus when

combined with a base operation. in other words the involution (y, x)  (y, x) does

not exist on the bre per se, but can exist, when combined with a base involution, on

a subspace (not as restrictive as the locus b = 0; actually only some monomials within

the coecient functions a, b, c are then forbidden) of the moduli space where the generic

member is still smooth. note that even away from b = 0 the coordinate involution maps

still the two sections on another.

in general the full action, being given by these actions on the bre accompanied by

suitable group actions on the basis, have, besides the requirement of not restricting us to

a non-smooth model above by the condition of their denedness, also then to fulll the

further conditions to provide free group actions, which leave the holomorphic three-form

invariant, as will be discussed further in section 4.

9the unspecialised, generic form of the b, c, d brations are smooth for the bases fm for m = 0, 1, 2

and dpk for k = 0, 1, 2, 9 and then ten additional toric polyhedra described in [4].

6

2.3 transitions

finally we discuss the relation between the a, b, c, d smooth weierstrass calabi-yau

three folds. if we force a second section for the a-type weierstrass bration z it takes
the general form y2 = 4(x + f )(x2  f x  g), where f, g are sections of l2, l4. from

g2 = 16  22/3(f 2 + g),

g3 = 64f g,  = (g  2f 2)2(f 2 + 4g)

wee see using kodairas classications of singular bers that it acquires an a1 ber
over a divisor b in the class [b
a1] = 4kb = 4c1 and the calculational framework
[2] needs modications. the smooth a-bre weierstrass model had euler number
1(b) and if we resolve the singularities over the divisor b we get
an extremal transition10 from z to a model z, whose change in the euler number

rz c3(z) = 60rb c2
[9] is given by  = cox(g)rank(g)rb c1(b). by the adjunction formula we calculate
 = 2rb c1(b) = 24rb c2

1(b). this model is up
to birational transformations the elliptic bration with b-bre type over the same base,

1(b), which yields r z c3( z) = 36rb c2

whose euler number depends on the base cohomology in precisely this way [9]. similarly
forcing three sections produces an a2 singularity over [b] = 3kb [10], and the extremal
1(b), the c-
bre type. finally forcing four sections leads by a slightly more complicated transition

transition leads with  = 6rb c1(b) = 36rb c2

1(b) to r z c3( z) = 24rb c2

to the d-bration.

2.4 the cohomology of the spaces

the dierent bration structures leads in the following way to the cohomological data

of z (we give, as an example, a consideration of the b-model, cf. for the a-model [2];

unspecied chern classes will always refer to the base b).

as noted z, x, y can be thought of as homogeneous coordinates on w respectively
globally as sections of line bundles o(1), o(1)  l and o(1)2  l2 whose rst chern

classes are given by r, r + c1, 2r + 2c1 with c1(o(1)) = r. the cohomology ring of w is
generated by r with the relation r(r+c1)(2r+2c1) = 0 expressing the fact that z, x, y have
no common zeros. since the b-model is dened by the vanishing of a section of o(1)4l4,

which is a line bundle over w with rst chern class 4(r + c1), the restriction from w to
z is eected by multiplying by this chern class, so that c(w ) = (1 + 4r + 4c1)c(z). one
can then simplify r(r + c1)(2r + 2c1) = 0 to r(r + c1) = 0 in the cohomology ring of z

10take type iia on the same calabi-yau space, then we get physical interpretation of the transition.

(2.1)

using r2 = rc1 and taking into account that the divisor (z = 0) of the section z of the
line bundle o(1) of class r shows that r = 1 + 2 (as z = 0 implies y2 = x4, leading to
(x, y) = (i, 1) and (i, 1)) we nd11

the computations for the c and d model can be done the same way and one nds for
i=1 i, so that
one has r =  for the b, c, d models in contrast to the r = 3 of the a model (note

the cohomological data of z (if one denes the sum of the sections  = pk

that the simplication relation is r(r + c1) = 0 in the b, c, d models in contrast to the
r(r + 3c1) = 0 in the a model, the only case where a section occurs with a multiplicity
(namely 3) in r); so in all cases the adjunction relations 2

should)

2.5 examples

2.5.1 over hirzebruch bases

let us consider as an example the b-type bration over b = f0. as on reads o
from the table of weight given above, a, b, c are sections of line bundles corresponding
to polynomials of bi-degree (4, 4), (6, 6) and (8, 8) over f0 = p1  p1, which yields
h2,1 = 52 + 72 + 92  3  3  1 = 148, where the subtraction comes from the two sl(2, c)
automorphism on the two p1 and the rescaling. of the (1, 1)-forms two come from base

and two from the two sections. over f2 our calabi-yau is the p1,1,2,4,8(16) just as in the
a bre case one had the p1,1,2,8,12(24).

2.5.2 over rational elliptic bases

let us consider as an example, which becomes important later in section (4.2), the case

b = dp9. let us rst recall that we denote by dp9 the rational elliptic surface being given
by the projective plane p 2
x,y,z blown up in the nine intersection points of two cubics. the
later will be denoted by c, c . this representation sc(x, y, z) + tc (x, y, z) = 0 (with

s, t coordinates on p 1) of dp9 = h p 2

8 points (the ninth is determined as they have to add up to zero in the group law) on

of freedom and the rescaling comes from pgl(3, c). alternatively one can count the

monomials as 10  2  8  3  1 = 8. from this surface one can build the calabi-yau

product structure in case the base is a dp9: the fact that the coecient functions f and
g are sections of a line bundle l of class c1(dp9) = f (here f denotes the elliptic bre of
dp9) means that they are linear in the base p 1 and independent of the bre direction (so
having polar divisor f ). note further that these calabi-yau spaces z when restricted to
the base p 1 (of the base (i.e. horizontal) dp9) have again the structure of a (vertical) dp9,
with correspondingly changed elliptic bre type. this is the well known representation
dp9 = 1
2 k3: if b would be one-dimensional one would get a k3 for c1(l) = c1(p 1) = 2
which would double the degrees of the coecient functions. so changing from k3 to
1
2k3 means in the b model to consider y2 + x4 + a2(s, t)x2z2 + b3(s, t)xz3 + c4(s, t)z4 = 0.

note that although the k3 in the a, b, c model have because of the added sections a

decreasing number of deformations, one has nevertheless by going to the rational elliptic

surfaces, i.e. the corresponding 1
2k3, always the 8 deformations as one easily convinces
oneself in dividing the mentioned degrees by two (for example 3 + 4 + 5  3  1 = 8
in the b model); i.e. one always has for them the same characteristics h1,1 = 10 =

mentioned c  modelh p

the base p 1 where both the elliptic bres of the two dp9 bre factors degenerate are
generically disjoint).

3 the bundles

3.1 the spectral cover description

let us recall the idea of the spectral cover description of an su(n) bundle v : one

considers the bundle rst over an elliptic bre and then pastes together these descriptions

using global data in the base b. now over an elliptic bre e an su(n) bundle v over

z (assumed to be brewise semistable) decomposes as a direct sum of line bundles of

degree zero; this is described as a set of n points which sums to zero. if you now let this

vary over the base b this will give you a hypersurface c  z which is a ramied n-fold

cover of b. if one denotes the cohomology class in z of the base surface b (embedded
by the zero-section 1) by   h 2(z) one nds that the globalization datum suitable to
encode the information about v is given by a class   h 1,1(b) with12

c = n + 

(3.4)

the idea is then to trade in the su(n) bundle v over z, which is in a sense essentially

a datum over b, for a line bundle l over the n-fold (ramied) cover c of b: one has

v = p(p

cl  p)

(3.5)

with p : z b c  z and pc : z b c  c the projections and p the global version of
the poincare line bundle over e  e (actually one uses a symmetrized version of this),

i.e. the universal bundle which realizes the second e in the product as the moduli space

of degree zero line bundles over the rst factor.

12c is given as a locus w = 0 with w a section of o()n  m with a line bundle m of class .

10

a second parameter in the description of v is given by a half-integral number  which

occurs because one gets from the condition c1(v ) = (c1(l) + c1(c)c1
  ker  : h 1,1(c)  h 1,1(b) one has

(3.7)

as n1|c   + nc1 is the only generally given class which projects to zero. as we are
in a dierent set-up than [2] one has actually a further possibility which is described in

section 5.

considering the chiral matter content one nds then as the number of net generations

one has, in order to get all the relevant fermions, in the case of an su(5) bundle - unlike
the case of an su(3) or su(4) bundle - to consider also the 2v = 10 to get the 5 part
of the fermions 10  5; but the 10 and the 5 will come in the same number of families
by anomaly considerations.

3.3 the cohomology of the bundles

note that in order to apply the formalism of [2], to compute the generation number

of v and to make the checks on the eectiveness of the ve-brane class below we have

to take into account that we are now working in calabi-yau spaces with a dierent

representation of the elliptic bre e. this changes the cohomological data of z itself (as

11

described above) but could also change the expression for c2(v ) and c3(v ) if you look at
grothendieck-riemann-roch

(ec1(l)t d(c)) = ch(v )t d(b)

(3.10)

which shows an inuence in c2(v ) of the change of c2(z) relative to the a model: as
c2(z) occurs in the chern classes c1(c) = (n1 + ) and c2(c) = c2(z) + c2
1(c) of the
spectral cover (note that the whole spectral cover construction always uses only the zero

section 1) one gets the following. the new term to consider is the push-down (from c
to b) of  (coming from c2(z) in c2(c); the complete term there is a 12
k c1 inside c2(z),
times 1
12 because of t d(c)); this can also be understood as the push-down from z to b
i=1 i; this is
pushed down to nc1 + k, so the whole term inside c2(z) goes to 1
k c1 + 12)c1.
the second summand here is especially important as it gives13 the rst term (which, as

i=1 i = (nc1 + )1 + pk

of c which is (n1 + )pk

i=2 i = nc11 + pk
12(n 12

we see, remains unchanged compared to the a model as k cancels out) in the nal result
for c2(v ) = 1 +  (where   h 4(b), pulled back to z.

now let us give the second chern class for v (one has (2) = 2n((  nc1)):

c2(v ) =

3.4 the parabolic approach

of course this is no accident that the bundle does not see the changed bre. one has

a second approach to describe bundles and compute their chern classes [2],[18]. in the

parabolic approach one starts with an unstable bundle on a single elliptic curve e. for

this one xes a point p on e with the associated rank 1 line bundle o(p) = w1. rank
k line bundles wk are then inductively constructed via the unique non-split extension
0  o  wk+1  wk  0. if one writes the dual of wk as w 
k then the unique (up
13by doing the grr for  : c  b we actually compute only c2(v )|1 ; so the term c1 in the
expression for the restriction comes because of 1|1 = c1|1 (from adjunction) from a term 1 in

the total expression for c2(v ). this, and the further statement that in the cases with changed elliptic

bre the element which restricts to 1 does not involve the other i (say in the combination ), can be

checked from the corresponding grr formula for p : z b c  z (this is described in [3]); there one
sees that the corresponding term comes from the poincare bundle, which involves only 1.

bundle v  which ts then into the exact sequence 0  w

nk  v   wk  0.

k  w 

to get a global version of this construction on replaces the wk by their global versions,
i.e. replace o(p) by o(1). the global versions of wk are inductively constructed by an
exact sequence 0  ln1  wk  wk1  0. using the fact that one can globally twist
line bundles m and m on b, one nds
by additional data coming from the base, i.e.

the unstable su(n) bundle

v = wk  m  w 

nk  m

(3.12)

with wk = lk1

b=0 lb and m, m are constrained so that v has
trivial determinant. note that the specication of the twisting line bundle m corresponds

nk = lnk1

a=0 la, w 

to the specication of  in the spectral cover approach (cf.[2], [18]). since the topology

of v is invariant under deformations one computes chern classes simply of v using

nk1

c(v ) =

ya=0

(1 + c1(la) + c1(m))

yb=0

(1 + c1(lb) + c1(m))

(3.13)

which is independent of the bre type (a, b, c, d).

3.5 bundle moduli and index theorems

let us also point out that the z2 equivariant index i = ne no of [2], counting the bundle
moduli which are even respectively odd under the  -involution, does not change under

exchanging the elliptic bre of z. recall that i can be interpreted as giving essentially

the holomorphic euler characteristic of the spectral surface [19] which is

3.6 restrictions on the bundle parameters

after these introductory remarks we proceed to the actual construction of the examples.

this will be done in two steps: rst we specify the vector bundle (above) over z and then

13

we make explicit the involution. for this let us recapitulate what are the requirements:

we are searching an su(5) resp. so(10) bundle v with 6 resp. 12 net-generations on

a calabi-yau admitting a freely acting z2 which respects the holomorphic three-form.
the conditions concerning the calabi-yau z will be treated in the next section. the

conditions concerning the bundle v amount to the following.

3.6.1 restriction on 

from

c1(l) = n(

1
2

+ ) + (

1
2

 ) + (

1
2

+ n)c1

(3.16)

one sees that the easiest (and the only general) way to fulll the requirement of integral-
ity14 for c1(l) is to require  to be strictly half-integral for n odd resp. to be strictly
integral and   c1 mod 2 for n even. more exotic possibilities involve  = 1
2n for n odd
and   0 mod n [18] or for example  = 1

4 for n = 4 and  = 2c1 mod 4.

combined with the searched for generation number obvious restrictions result on the

possible  (for example  = 1/2, 3/2 where one has then to construct on the calabi-

yau above (before the modding) a model with (  5c1) = 12 or 4 in the su(5)
case).

3.6.2 the upper bound on 

the essential restrictions on v come from bounds on the  class. the upper bound comes

from the anomaly cancellation condition c2(z) = c2(v1)+c2(v2)+w (we have here v2 = 0)
giving the eectiveness restriction c2(v )  c2(z) on the ve-brane class w = wb + af f ;
clearly here a second eectiveness condition is emerging for af :
it has to be (integral
and) non-negative15. now remember that in the nal result for c2(v ) = 1 +  (where
  h 4(b), pulled back to z) the number k of the model (1, 2, 3, 4 for a, b, c, d)

cancelled out leaving the a model result unchanged. on the other hand note that we
have a corresponding decomposition c2(z) = 12
1)). this is the term
responsible for the upper bound 1  12
k c1 (which is thus much sharper
than in the a model) from the eectiveness restriction on the ve-brane class.

k c1, i.e.   12

k c1 + (c2 + ( 12

k  1)c2

14note that these conditions assure the integrality of c2(v ) too.
15in the case of a hirzebruch surface fk with k  3 it is sucient to have non-negativity of af  wbc1

(cf. [17])

14

3.6.3 the lower bound on 

this is a bound on how much instanton number has to be turned on to generate/ll

out a certain su(n) bundle, or speaking in terms of the unbroken gauge group g (the

commutator of su(n) in e8) a condition to have no greater unbroken gauge group than
a certain g.

let us recall the situation in six dimensions. there the easiest duality set-up is given

by the duality of the heterotic string on k3 with instanton numbers (12  m, 12 + m)

(and no ve-branes) with f -theory on the hirzebruch surface fm [13]. the gauge group
there is described by the singularities of the bration and a perturbative heterotic gauge

group corresponds to a certain degeneration over the zero-section c0 (of self-intersection
m): for example to get an su(3) one needs a certain a2 degeneration over c0 available
rst for m = 3; in general this means that the discriminant divisor  = 12c1(fm) has a
component (g)c0 where (g) is the vanishing order of the discriminant (equivalently
the euler number of the ane resolution tree of the singularity), giving also the relation
m  24
12(g) for the realization over a fm to have no singularity worse than g. the last
relation follows (cf. [20]) from the fact that after taking the c0 component with its full
multiplicity (g) out of  the resulting  =   (g)c0 has transversal intersection
with c0 and so   c0  0, leading with c1(fm) = 2c0 + (2 + m)f to the mentioned
result.

so the instanton number 12  m to give a g gauge group has to be 12  m  12 
24
12(g) = (6  12
12(g) )c1(b1) with b1 the common p 1 base of the heterotic k3 resp. the
fm. from this it was conjectured in [20] that a similar bound could in four dimensions
look like the generalizations of both sides of the six-dimensional bound, i.e. in view of the

fact that the (12m, 12+m) structure generalizes in four dimensions to 1 = 6c1 t, 2 =
6c1 + t (for this cf. the anomaly cancellation condition c2(v1) + c2(v2) + af f = c2(z) and
its component 1 + 2 = 12c1 concerning the classes not pull-backed from h 4(b) for
the case of an a model with wb = 0)

1  (6 

12

12  (g)

)c1

(3.17)

7 c1 resp.   18

so nally one has to fulll the lower bound   30

5 c1 in the case of an
su(5) resp. so(10) unbroken gauge group (the coecients come from the expression
6  12
12 in [20] with  the vanishing order 5 resp. 7 of the discriminant). as our breaking
scheme involves one resp. two z2s (and so the b resp. d model) for unbroken su(5)
resp. so(10) we see that, in view of the upper bound   3c1 in the d model case, we
are left with the possibility of breaking su(5) via the b model.

15

3.7 restricting attention to v1

when giving in the following subsection our examples we will restrict attention to the

visible sector, i.e. to the 1 sector in the bundle embedding (v1, v2)  e8  e8, and will
neglect the hidden 2 sector concerning v2. this is justied up to the occurrence of the
compensating ve-brane class in

c2(v1) + c2(v2) + w = c2(z)

(3.18)

which connects the two sectors. as we will consider a b type model of z we will

have c2(z) = 6c11 + 6c12. now the decomposition (suitable pull-backs understood)
(iih 2(b))  h 4(b) leads for the parts not coming from h 4(b) to

11 + 2j + wb = 6c11 + 6c12

(3.19)

where j = 1 or 2 according to whether we choose to build v2 using the same section 1 as
for v1 or the other one, i.e. 2 (the spectral cover construction uses in its essential parts
just the possible globalization of a point p on an elliptic ber curve, relative to which

degree zero line bundles are transmuted into divisors q  p for another point q; there

is no geometric distinction which forces one of the sections to be called the zero-section

with respect to the group law).

b + w (2)

so we have actually two possible strategies for saturating on the lhs of the last
equation the 6c12 of the rhs: either we put it in a w (2)
b  or we choose j = 2 and
2 = 6c1. so let us now also introduce the decomposition wb = w (1)
b by which
we mean w (2)
b = 6c12 for j = 1 (actually we will then not even turn on at all a second
bundle, i.e. 2 = 0, 2 = 0, as the lower bound leaves no space for this) respectively
w (2)
b = 0 for j = 2 in which latter case also 2 = 6c1 is understood. we do so just for the
sake of simplicity; of course one can easily elaborate a more general scheme for v2 lying
between the extreme cases j = 1 (i.e. no bundle constructed over 2 and further even
2 = 0, 2 = 0) together with a maximal w (2)
b = 6c12 on the one hand or j = 2 and a
maximal 2 = 6c1 and no w (2)
b . this would repeat just the treatment of the 1 sector
apart from the fact that now both these sectors are not disentangled because there is
still the h 4(b) part of the anomaly equation giving the number of ve-branes wrapping

by choosing n2 = 3 or 5 and 2 = 6c1, 2 = 1/2.

f are easily accomplished

so the upshot is we have now reduced the discussion to the (1) sector and shall omit
b = 6c12 (and 2 = 0, 2 = 0) or an

below the (1) index, it being understood that a w (2)
2 = 6c1 runs in the second sector.

3.8 examples

so one has to nd an  in the strip 30
resp. (  5c1) = 4 (for  =  3
f0, f1, f2 and the dpks) where af = c2 + 10c2
 =  3

1  20 for
2 the dp9; of course one can work in that case

2 resp. af = c2 + 10c2

2 getting 6 net-generations).

(2) brations over p 1

now let us specify the su(5) bundle over z. recall that the hirzebruch surfaces
fm are p 1
(1) possessing a section of self-intersection m and have
c1(fm) = (2, 2 + m) in a basis (for the eective cone) (b, f ) with b2 = n and f the ber.
the data which specify our bundle over f1 are now given by

 = +

3
2

,  = (11, 15)

note that besides leading to a net-number of 6 generations these data fulll the series

of further conditions mentioned above with w = (1, 3) + 64 f . this is (in the given set-

up) the only solution on a hirzebruch surface fr, r = 0, 1, 2. over the del pezzo surfaces
dpk there are many more possibilities (here of course the example over f1 reoccurs; we
are using the basis (l, (ei)i=1...k) where for example c1 = (3, 1k); keep in mind that the
j=1 eij
16of course one could imagine a more general procedure which demands these conditions only for the

classes l  ei and l  ei  ej when n  2, 2l p5

total af as only this has an absolute meaning

bounds on ). note that the ve-brane class w = wb + af f is given by wb = 6c1  
and af = 93  9k for  =  1
2 . besides a long list
of 6 generation models which can be given for the del pezzo surfaces (which we will not

j=1 eij  p5
2 resp. af = 93  9k  20 for  =  3

list as we will have no suitable involution on z) one also nds examples on dp9 (with
af = 12 for  = 1

4 free zn symmetries

4.1 modding the spaces

here we construct elliptically bered calabi-yau threefolds z with sections, which admit

an action  of an discrete group g, such that the following requirements are met:

 a.) z is smooth,

 b.) the action is free, i.e. the xpoint set is empty,

 c.) the action leaves the holomorphic (3, 0)-form invariant.

we call z  = z/g, let pr denote the projection. note that z  is again an elliptic bration
(of b type elliptic bre) over a base b. to get a zn action we will start with the elliptic
bration with n sections and use the algebraic zn action from sect. 2, together with an
in general non-free order n action on the base. more precisely what happens is this (let

us put n = 2, the case of our main example). as we consider an involution  compatible

with the bration we have an involution  already dened on b alone with    =   
(note that b = b/g). the group action  maps both sections onto each other, their
image downstairs in z  will be an irreducible surface  (still isomorphic to b). is this 
a section in z  ? now, from pr  prf = 2   f where f denotes the bre downstairs
(lying over a generic point b in the base b of z ), one learns that it is actually only a

bi-section because the left hand side is evaluated as 4 = 2 + 2 as each of the two sections

i, i = 1, 2, in the preimage of  intersects each of the two bers in z above (lying over

18

the preimages of b in b) twice. so in general after the modding n sections become one
n-section. one looses therefore at least n  1 independent divisor classes in h 1,1.

in the following we will describe more closely the modding process: rst in section

(4.1) for a hirzebruch basis; here we nd free involutions for f0 and f2, so they will not
lead to 3 generations on z  as a corresponding 6 generation model on z was found in

the last section only over f1; then in section (4.2) we nd a free involution for the case
b2 = dp9, for which examples of 6 net generations were found at the end of the last
section.

4.1.1 toric descriptions

in the following we will describe calabi-yau spaces z dened as hypersurfaces in toric

ambient spaces, with the three ber types a, b, c. as we mentioned in the introduction,

the 15 2-d toric reexive polyhedra b from [4] lead to smooth brations for all bre
types. the four dimensional polyhedra, which dene the calabi-yau threefold following
[15], are given by the convex hull of the points {[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [b, (i)])}, where
the b runs over the points in b and (1) = (2, 3), (2) = (1, 2) and (3) = (1, 1) for
the a, b, c ber types. by the formulas derived in section 2.4, we can express the

cohomological information of z entirely in terms of the base cohomology.

c3(z) = 2hc1(b)2

where the lefthand side is integrated over z and the righthand side over b. je is as
cohomology element supported on the elliptic bre, its dual homology element is the

base, while the ji are as cohomology elements supported on curves in b, while the
homology element is the dual curve in b and the ber over it.

in order to see whether requirements a.)-c.) are met we give a coordinate description of

z, which turns out to be a straightforward generalization of the notion of a homogeneous

polynomial in a projective space. we shall proceed in an example and consider as bases

fn n = 0, 1, 2. the polyhedron b contains the points [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, n], [0, 0]
and hence  is given by the convex hull of points i i = 0, . . . 7 in r4 equipped with the
standard z-basis for a lattice

the sri. still this is a formidable task in general, but for 3-d calabi-yau manifolds it

is equivalent to reexivity of  [15]. this fact has been used to check that the brations

over bases from [4] are indeed smooth and will be used to show that the member of the

family admitting the g-action is smooth. using the description of the cohomology by

[15] we get h1,1 = 4(1) in all cases and h2,1 = 148(0) for f0 and f1 and 148(1) for f2.

group, which is not xed by this choice is the automorphism group of the base and

an overall scaling. then the discriminant of (4.27) is suciently simple to be analysed
directly19

 = (9a4c + 36ab2c  72a2c2 + 144c3  a3b3  3b4).

(4.28)

starting from (4.27) we may count the h2,1 forms by enumerating perturbations modulo
the remaining automorphism. e.g. for f0 a, b, c are sections of line bundles corresponding
to polynomials of bi-degree (4, 4), (6, 6) and (8, 8) over f0 = p1  p1, which yields
h2,1 = 52 + 72 + 92  3  3  1 = 148 (cf. section (2.5.1)).

in order that the holomorphic three-form is not projected out the total action of the

zn on the cotangent space of z must be a subgroup of su(3). the condition is easily
xidxkdxldxm

checked on the explicit expression of the holomorphic three-form   qi6=k,l,m,p
from which we see that phase actions xi  wixi with n = 1 and p wi = 0 mod n leave

 invariant. hence z2 acting on the calabi-yau z by

xp p

(s, t, u, v, z, x, y)  (s, t, u, v, x, y, z)

(4.29)

is an action with property c). to nd the x point set we must take into account the sri
and the c actions. if n is even then (0, t, u, 0, 0, 0, z) is a xed stratum in the ambient

space, the sri enforces z 6= 0, t 6= 0 and u 6= 0 and (4.26) restricted to the stratum is
empty (z4u8t4(2n) = 0 in contradiction with the sri) on z. similarly the other xed
strata on which the action (4.29) can be undone by the c-actions have no intersection
with p = 0. on the other hand if n is odd then by the c actions (s, 0, u, v, x, 0, z) turn

out to be the xed stratum, which intersects z in particular for n = 1 in a f ix = 16
curve.

hence to have a.) we shall restrict ourselves to the x point free actions on f0 and f2
and consider transversality of the specialized polynomial which admits the z2 involution.
we may check transversality by showing that the polyhedron, which corresponds to the
invariant monomials is again reexive. the invariant polyhedron  is constructed as
in [16] by considering a sublattice  of index 1

by constructing (f0), (f2) we see that they are indeed reexive polyhedra and the
cohomology of the associated calabi-yau space is  = 144, h1,1 = 3 and h2,1 = 75,
with one non-generic complex structure modulus for the (f2) case20. again in the
f0 case it is simpler to count in (4.27) the invariant monomials in a, b, c, which yields
13+24+41. note that each sl(2, c) is broken by (4.29) to the diagonal rescaling. hence

h2,1 = 78  3 = 75. the change in (1, 1) forms from 4 to 3 is due to the fact that the 2
sections become a 2-section, as explained above. note also that (4.28) remains generic
since enough terms in (a, b, c) survive the projection, hence z and so z  is smooth. i.e.

for these cases all requirements a.)-c.) are fullled.

similarly we can obtain a free z3 action on the c-ber over p2.

if we introduce

coordinates (s, t, r) for the base and (x, y, z) for the bre as before, then the action

(r, s, t, z, x, y)  (3r, 2

3s, t, 2

3x, 3y, z)

(4.31)

is a free z3 which changes the hodge numbers from  = 216, h2,1 = 112, h1,1 = 4(2) to
 = 72, h2,1 = 38 and h1,1 = 2.

an afterthought

let us remark about some related points in constructing free involutions.

in two

dimensions analogue there is a famous construction which is somewhat analogous, the

free enriques involution (killing the holomorphic two-from) on (certain) k3 . this gives
as quotient again a surface elliptically bered over p1 of the same hodge numbers as dp9
but has generically 10 deformations and two multiple bers (so in particular does not

have a section; if one performs logarithmic transformations on them one connects to the

dp9 surface), whose dierence constitutes the canonical class which is two-torsion (after
all, it vanishes above), a second marked dierence to dp9.

note that if we take in our construction of b bered calabi-yau (which are also k3
brations) just the k3 bre part (i.e. neglect the overall base p1 and the part of the

involution operating there) this leads to a k3 cover of an enriques (the well-dendness

of the operation restricts one then in the deformation space of the k3 where the b type

bration is kept manifest to a nine-dimensional space).

note further that if one would take just the calabi-yau (t 2k3enr)/z2 and considered
it as k3 bered over the rst factor21 then one gets a calabi-yau with a fundamental

group including z2 but this model has no section (although the generic k3 bre has a
20in accordance with the x point formula new = (f ix)/n +n f ix, we nd for (f1):  = 168,

h1,1 = 4 and h2,1 = 88(9), i.e. nine non-generic complex structure moduli.

21if one bres over the second factor [17] one encounters diculties with the eectiveness restrictions

as the enriques base then has a torsion canonical class

22

section, over four points in the base one has the enriques as bre which has no section

but only a bi-section); as one would here have above an n = 2 situation one has there

no chiral matter.

4.1.2 an example over dp9

as the brations over f0 and f2 did not give rise to 6 net generation models within
the relevant bounds, as discussed in section 3, let us consider the b model bration
over dp9, i.e. the calabi-yau space z = dp b
9 p 1 dp9 (the rst bre factor indicates
the vertical dp9, the second one the horizontal base). we will choose for the base the
dp b
too. we want to supplement the involution (y, x)  (y, x) in the bre by a
9

second involution coming from the base. for this we combine (but see next footnote)
the action (s, t)  (s, t) in the base p1 with the hyperelliptic involution in the bre of

the horizontal base dp9.

so let (x, y, z) be the coordinates of the ber of the vertical dp9, (s, t) the coordinates
of the common base p1 and (x, y, z) the coordinates of the ber of the horizontal p1.

let us recall the coordinate form

y2 + x4 + a2(s, t)x2z2 + b3(s, t)xz3 + c4(s, t)z4 = 0

(4.32)

of the vertical dp b
9 , with r = (c[x, y, z, s, t]  sri)/(c)2) where sri is generated
by x = y = z = 0, s = t = 0 and l(1) = (1, 2, 1, 0, 0), l(2) = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1), shows that

monomials within a, b, c are invariant under the action; i.e. we are not forced to a singular

locus like b = 0.

this is easily enhanced to a bre product structure, which is given by the following

complete intersection (we choose b = dp b
9 )

y2 + x4 + a2(s, t)x2z2 + b3(s, t)xz3 + c4(s, t)z4 = 0

y2 + x4 + a2(s, t)x2z2 + b3(s, t)xz3 + c4(s, t)z4 = 0

(4.33)

the c-actions are specied by

l(1) = (1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

l(2) = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1)

l(3) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1)

(4.34)

then we consider the action

(x, y, z, s, t, x, y, z)  (x, y, z, s, t, x, y, z),

(4.35)

23

i.e. as before we supplement the involution in the bre by a second involution acting

on the base dp9. clearly this operation leaves the holomorphic (3, 0) form invariant as
(1)4 = +1.

coordinates
(x, y, z, s, t, x, y, x). we start by distinguishing between two cases, which are neces-

look for possible x loci by searching strata in the

sarily to have xed strata, namely either s 6= 0 and t = 0 or s = 0 and t 6= 0. in the rst
case the largest possible xed strata are either (x, 0, z, s, 0, 0, 0, z) or (x, 0, z, s, 0, x, 0, 0),
which both do not intersect (4.33) as the second equation forces either (z = 0 or s = 0)
or x = 0 all in the sri and therefore excluded. in the second case the largest possible
strata are either (x, 0, 0, 0, t, x, 0, z) or (0, 0, z, 0, t, x, 0, z), which for similar reasons as

above do not intersect with the rst equation in (4.33). if we look for the rst case only
in the vertical bre then we see here 4 xpoints over one tip22 of p1 at t = 0. likewise

for the second case, if we look only in the horizontal bre, we see here 4 xpoints over the
other tip of p1 s = 0. the fact that, on the other hand, at t = 0 (s = 0) in the p1 the ac-
tion in the horizontal (vertical) bre is the shift (y, x)  (y, x) ((y, x)  (y, x))

is a more conceptual way to see that the total action is actually free.

the number of deformations which is h2,1(z) = 2(3 + 4 + 5)  3  1  1 = 19 on the
covering drops by the modding to h2,1(z ) = 2(2 + 2 + 3)1 1 1 = 11. likewise by the
lefschetz xpoint formula one nds for the number of surviving (1, 1)-forms n+
1,1 = 11
22note here a special property of our construction of dp9 in a nontrivial (weighted) p2 bundle as

opposed to the usual h p

hyperelliptic involution with 4 xed points. in that sense our involution are not just a naive combination
of the p1 involution and the hyperelliptic involution.

check using eq. (4.28) that the invariant monomials, just counted, are generic enough to

keep the space smooth. so, as the euler number remains zero, we mod from a (19, 19)
calabi-yau z to an (11, 11) calabi-yau z . note that again our conditions a.)-c.) are

fullled.

4.2 modding the bundles

in the old case of using the tangent bundle, obviously the bundle was carried along when

just modding out the space: one knows then that the bundle above on the calabi-yau
z is a pullback of the tangent bundle downstairs of the modded calabi-yau z  and

it follows, in the case of modding by an involution  (the case of interest here for us),

that the euler number relevant for the net generation number (= euler/2) is accordingly

reduced, i.e. rz t (z) = 2rz  t (z ). to mod the bundle in the more general case one

has just to assume that one really starts from a bundle on z  where one later breaks
the gauge group by turning on wilson lines using 1(z ) = z2. on the other hand to
compute the generation number one has to work upstairs as z  does not have a section

but only a bi-section (left over from the two sections of z as discussed above) and so one
can not use the spectral cover method, as developed so far, directly on z : remember

that the crucial translation from bundle data to geometrical data occurred when a bundle

(decomposing brewise into a sum of line bundles) is described brewise by a collection

of points, for which a choice of reference point p (the zero in the group law) has to be

made (to represent a degree zero line bundle by the divisor qi  p); one then needed,
for this collection of points to t together to the branched n-fold covering c of b, the

existence of a global reference point, i.e. a section. so we will actually lift back the bundle
v  we have downstairs on z  (whose generation number we want to compute as 3) to a

bundle v on z which should then, because of rz v = 2rz  v , have 6 generations (and is

then moddable by construction).

now, how can one be sure when one constructed a bundle above with 6 generations
that it actually was such a pull-back from z  ? clearly for this v should be  invariant.
for this let us make the following consideration23. first, when one just has a bundle on z,

where z is a b type elliptically bered calabi-yau, one can v translate into geometrical

data in two ways: namely one can analyze v with respect to both global reference points

23note that we consider bration compatible involutions, which are thus already dened on the base

b alone and map a ber over a base point to another bre.

25

(i.e. sections) giving the alternative descriptions ci = ni + i for i = 1 and 2. but as
it is both times actually the same bundle all invariants associated with v , such as the

chern classes, must coincide. this will be the case if both s and s coincide (this is

just a sucient condition).

now, secondly, let us assume that we are actually analyzing a bundle v on z which
is a pull-back from a bundle v  on z . again we can analyze v relative to 1. but
now we have to make explicit the condition of -invariance, i.e. (as the spectral cover of
v with respect to the 2 would be24 c1) we have to move c1 by  (of course, as the
geometrical information encoded in a spectral cover as c1 is dened only relative to the
global reference point 1, one has for the correct interpretation of (c1) to read it relative
to (1) = 2) and get a spectral cover (c1) over 2 of class [(c1)] = n2 + (1); so,
from what was said in the preconsideration and as we require now v = v , one nds

the -invariance condition fullled for (1) = 1 (and c1(b2) should be x, too; similar
considerations pertain to ; again we are presenting sucient conditions, but note that
in our case (b = f0 or f2) the  operation induced on h 1,1(b) will be trivial anyway).

now, in the two actual examples over f0 and f2, where we could mod the calabi-
yau, one has a basis of h 1,1(b) consisting in the classes b and f , the base (of negative

self-intersection, say) and the bre class. now, in dolbeault cohomology the relevant

representatives of the top (1, 1) form of these two p1 are given in local coordinates by,
say, dzdz; but these classes are invariant under the phase rotations (actually (1)s) on

the p1. so that condition does not represent a restriction.

note that this could be a true restriction. for example, in case of a dp9 base, the
involution in the base (which can be non-free) could have, say, 8 or 4 x points if we

combine the (s, t)  (s, t) operation in the base p1 with the hyperelliptic involution
or our coordinate involution (in the case of dp b
9 ). by lefschetz we see that, say, 8 =
2 + n+  n with n the 1 eigenclasses of the induced  operation on h 1,1(b); from
n+ + n = 10 one gets that n = 2 resp. 4 classes for the 4 xed point case are actually
projected out. by contrast in our cases of hirzebruch bases, where our involution not

only respects the elliptic bration of the calabi-yau but also the internal p1 bration of
the base, our operation there again factorizes into operations (like (s, t)  (s, t)) of

both the p1s, so that from the two individual xed points on each of them one gets four
overall xed points in b and so, of course obvious anyway, from lefschetz in that case

that n = 0, i.e. no real restriction results.

24the transport by  of line bundles over an elliptic bre, which is a map between p ic0s, is, when the

p ic0s are again identied with the elliptic bre, again the map 

26

5 genuine b type bundles

up to now the inuence of the choice of a b type elliptic bered base calabi-yau z

had a rather restricted impact on the general set-up. essentially the inuence of this

alteration was restricted to the change in c2(z) which had its consequences for the upper
bound of  and a possibility to build the other bundle over 2. but there is an even
more interesting twist in the story which we have not mentioned before as we wanted

to keep the dierent steps of complication of the building of bundles disentangled as far

as possible. the new freedom we are now speaking about stems from the fact that we

have more divisors in the game and so a greater chance to build up a line bundle on

the spectral cover. remember that in the push-forward construction of v from l the

class of l was constrained by the requirement c1(v ) = 0; this determined c1(l) up to a
class in ker  : h 1,1(c)  h 1,1(b) killed by the push-forward25. in the a model one
has two obviuos sources of divisors, consisting of either pull-backs from b or the section

(restricted to c); then the combination in ker  was  = (n   + nc1). now, with a
second section, a new option arises:

 = (1 + c1  2)

(5.36)

one has    = 0, 2 = 2c1 and nds for the most general combination of  +  to
be used in building up l that  should be integral with  restrictions unchanged. the

inuence in cohomological data is (here a major computation is to be carried out which

for the a bre is outlined in the appendix of [3])

where the generation number is unchanged because rz c3(v ) = 0 as both i are sections

leading after integration over the bre to an integral over b times (1  1). of course that

 doesnt contribute is not an accident: the matter computation, described in [3] too,

shows that the matter is localized on the curve a = c  1  1(b); as v |1(b) = l the
computation of h0(z, v ) h1(z, v ) is reduced to h1(a, l|a k 1/2
a ) =
c1(l|a) = deg |a =   1 = 1 = (  nc1) where in the last equality the
intersection number was evaluated in b = 1(b) instead of c. but the corresponding
consideration for  shows that is doesnt contribute as   1 = 0.

a ) h0(a, l|a k 1/2

so regrettably, as we must still search for 6 generations with the pure  formula, this

somewhat impotent generalization, which is not capable of generating chiral matter by

25we neglect here the continuous moduli from h 1,0(c)

27

itself, allows us not, even when combined with the ordinary  class, to nd 6 generation

models over a hirzebruch surface where we can mod.

6 a further bundle parameter

as the two requirements in our search, 6 net generations and a moddable calabi-yau,

have lead us so far to mutually exclusive examples (f1 and dpk respectively f0 and f2),
we have still to broaden our arsenal of constructions. for this we will put the burden on

the generation number search and will use a second method to get chiral matter besides

turning on .

recall that in section (3.1) we explained the idea of the spectral cover construction to

trade in the su(n) bundle v over z for a line bundle l over a n-fold branched covering

c of b: one had

v = p(p

cl  p)

(6.38)

with p : z b c  z and p the (global) poincare line bundle over z  z (restricted to
z b c). we remarked there that the trade occurs essentially over b, i.e. on a surface
level, which referred to the fact that we got the line bundle l over z b c, which is
needed for the construction v = p(l  p), as a pull-back from a line bundle l over c.

actually the construction is naturally slightly generalized leading to a dependence on
a further parameter26 [3] when one takes into account the full capability of constructing

line bundles l over the three-fold z b c: z b c will have a set s of isolated singularities
(generically ordinary double points) when in the base the discriminant referring to the

z-direction meets the branch locus referring to the c direction. i.e. they are lying over
points in the base b where the branch divisor r = kc  kb of  : c  b, resp. its
image in b r = n(2 (n1)c1), meets the discriminant 12c1 (cf. the case of an elliptic
k3 over p1) of  : z  b. their number is (as detected in b) |s| = 12c1n(2(n1)c1).
one has a resolution  : y  z b c of the isolated singularities with e the exceptional
divisor. each of its |s| components is a divisor d = p1  p1 of triple self-intersection
d3 = (1, 1)2 = +2.

the resolution y  z b c leads to the possibility to formulate the whole con-
struction on y and twist there by the line bundle corresponding to a multiple l  z

of the exceptional divisor e. so one arrives at the description v = pl where

26a possibility already mentioned in [21]

28

l = p

cl  p  oy (le).

including this twist one gets for the generations in to-

tal

|s|

note that the additional contribution coming from c1(oy (le)) is even componentwise
integral as for example (for l  0) l(l1)(2l1)

i=1 i2.

= pl1

now what concerns the application in our search for 6 generation models over f0 or f2,
fate wants it that numerically it is still not possible to reach the number 6, essentially

because |s| = 12c1n(2  (n  1)c1) = 120c1(  2c1) turns out to be a somewhat
unpleasant large number which is unsuitable to be tuned to 6 even with the combined
eort of the (  5c1) term (  1

2 + z!).

but there is actually an easy way out. the exceptional divisor e decomposes into |s|

components and we are not forced to buy its eect in the total collection. i.e., we do not

have just a second discrete parameter l besides , but this l is actually a vector (li)is
of |s| components of integral numbers! the only thing we could be forced to is to take

an g-orbit (where g is the freely acting group by which nally we want to mod out; its

operates on the set s of singularities) to secure moddability.

but as in our case g is just z2, generated by the involution , this forces us at most to
turn on two individual li in parallel. when we take their common value to be 2 (so that
l(l1)(2l1)
= 1) their contribution in the generation number is only 1  2 = 2. but now it

6

is easy, by turning on enough lis, to reach 6.

g.c. thanks e. witten for pointing out the possibility of a construction similar to the

one considered here.
