abstract

complete constraint analysis and choice of gauge conditions consistent with
equations of motion is done for non-abelian chern-simons eld interacting with n-
component complex scalar eld.dirac-schwinger condition is satised by the reduced
phase-space hamiltonian density with respect to the dirac bracket.

pacs number(s): 0.350.kk, 11.10.ef

in an earlier work [1] it was shown that for abelian chern-simons eld interacting with
complex scalar eld,gauge conditions consistent with equations of motion can be chosen.
it was shown that the choice of gauge conditions crucially determines the transformation
properties in the reduced phase-space and invariance under lorentz transformations, par-
ticularly under boosts.invariance under boosts cannot be demonstrated unless the gauge
conditions are consistent with the equations of motion.

in the present paper we summarize our results for a similar demonstration for the non-
abelian chern-simons term. this system has been discussed by several authors [2, 3] but,
as far as we know proper gauge conditions have not been chosen for this system. we show
that in this case too gauge conditions can be chosen which are consistent with equations of
motion, even though there is no closed form for the reduced phase-space dirac brackets.
the dirac-schwinger conditions are satised, at least formally.this ensures relativistic
invariance.

lagrangian density for non-abelian chern-simons eld coupled to n-component scalar

eld is of the form

l = [d][d] +

sentation of the lie group su(n).here

gives a secondary constraint a

to choose gauge conditions for the two rst class constraints a

there is no closed form solution, but it can be solved iteratively as a formal series [4]

thus a

condition.

using a

1 and a

2 we can form dirac brackets. next we can do the same with a and

a and put them strongly equal to zero

therefore

  aa  gijac

0 = 0

these can solved as

therefore

  aa = 0

and aa

which can be solved for ba formally just as aa

0 was solved.
reduced phase-space hamiltonian density is of the form

dirac-schwinger equal time condition in reduced phase-space is

{00(x), 00(y)} = k(~x  ~y)[0k(x) + 0k(y)]

the transformation for elds can be done through the generators

p k = z d2x0k

m  = z d2x[x0  x0]

we therefore see that gauge conditions compatible with equations of motion can be

chosen for non-abelian case also giving qualitatively similar results to the abelian case.
