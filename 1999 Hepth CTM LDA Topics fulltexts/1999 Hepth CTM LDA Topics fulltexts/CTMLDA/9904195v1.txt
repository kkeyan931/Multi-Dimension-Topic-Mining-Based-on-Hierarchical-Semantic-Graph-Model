the well-known d-dimensional feynman integrals were shown, by halliday and ricotta, to be
capable of undergoing analytic continuation into the domain of negative values for the dimension
of space-time. furthermore, this could be identied with grassmannian integration in positive di-
mensions. from this possibility follows the concept of negative dimensional integration for loop
integrals in eld theories. using this technique, we evaluate three two-loop three-point scalar inte-
grals, with ve and six massless propagators, with specic external kinematic congurations (two
legs on-shell), and four three-loop two-point scalar integrals. these results are given for arbitrary
exponents of propagators and dimension, in euclidean space, and the particular cases compared to
results published in the literature.

i. introduction.

the study of quantum eld theories in the perturbative regime can sometimes become a very challenging and
arduous issue to deal with, especially when one needs to go on calculating multi-loop feynman integrals. there are
several techniques that have been developed and rened in the course of time, but usually the calculations are rather
involved and analytic results are dicult to obtain. depending on the approach one uses to tackle the problem, the
obstacles to surmount can be more or less demanding. for example, if one uses the standard feynman parametrization,
the integral over momentum space is straightforward  in the sense that nowadays one can easily nt them out even
tabulated in textbooks on quantum eld theories  but the resulting parametric integrals that are left over become
quite complicated and cumbersome to tackle, especially with increasing number of internal momenta in the loops. of
course, if one is clever enough, he/she may be able to overcome some of these hurdles and even perform really hard
calculations [1,2].

there are, of course, other techniques which have been considered in the literature, e.g., integration by parts and
gegenbauer polynomial method in conguration space [9]; the mellin-barnes representation for massive propagators
[10] to cite just a few of them [11], each one of those with its own strengths and weaknesses.

on the other hand, there is this novel technique known as negative dimensional integration method (ndim),
rst devised by halliday and ricotta [3]. it has as its starting point the principle of analytic continuation, it has the
remarkable property of being equivalent to grassmannian integration in (positive) d-dimensional space [4], it requires
only the integration of gaussian-like integrals and solving of linear algebraic equations and is suitable to deal with
massless [5] or massive [6] diagrams in on- and o-shell regimes [7] and even to carry out light-cone gauge integrals,
with added troublesome gauge-dependent poles [8].

our aim in this work is to demonstrate the simplicity of ndim calculating some scalar three-point integrals, with
ve and six massless propagators, at two-loop level and some two-point three-loop integrals also in the massless case.
the outline for our work is as follows:
in section ii we present a detailed calculation of a two-loop integral in the
ndim approach; in section iii we write down the results for the remaining two- and three-loop scalar integrals, while
in section iv we give our concluding remarks about this work.

ii. two-loop three-point vertex with six massless propagators.

this computation is performed following just a few simple steps [5]. fist of all, let us consider the gaussian-like

integral,

where the arguments in the exponential function of the integrand correspond to propagators in the diagram of fig.1,
with k2 = t2 = 0 satisfying the on-shell condition. for the sake of compactness, we dene

 =  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  + .

the parameters (, , , , , ) are quite general and arbitrary except that their real parts must be positive to make
sure we have well-dened objects over the whole integration region.

expanding the exponential in the second line of (1) in taylor series and using the multinomial expansion for the

argument of the exponential, we obtain,

f = d



x{x,y,z=0}

(p2)x(x  d/2)!abcdef

x1!    x4!y1!    y9!z1!z2!

xd/2,y+z,

(2)

where we have a fteen-fold sum, with x = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 and we dene,

a = x1 + x2 + x4 + y1 + y2 + y3 ,
b = x1 + x3 + y1 + y4 + y5 + y8 + z2 ,
c = x2 + x3 + y2 + y4 + y6 + y9 ,
d = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + y5 + y6 + y7 ,
e = y8 + y9 + z1 ,
f = x4 + y3 + y7 + z1 + z2 .

(3)

on the other hand, taking the taylor expansion of the exponential that is under the integration sign in (1), we

have,

f =



xi,j,l,m,n,s=0

(1)i+j+l+m+n+s

i!j!l!m!n!s!

n dim ,

where s 1

n dim is the relevant integral in negative d, dened by

s 1

n dim = z ddq ddr(q2)i(r2)j (q  r)2l(q + p)2m(q  k)2n(q  r  k)2s.

(4)

(5)

now comparing both expressions for the original integral f we are led to the conclusion that, in order to have

equality between these two expressions, the factor s 1

n dim must be given by the multiple series,

s 1

n dim = p1

d),

and for convenience we use the denition  = i + j + l + m + n + s + d. the system we must solve has, therefore,
fteen unknowns (the indices x, y, z) and only seven equations  six of which comes from comparing the exponents
of (, ,   ) and one from the multinomial expansion, namely, y + z = x  d/2. so, such a system can only be
solved in terms of some of these unknowns, and we conclude, from the combinatorics, that there are c 15
7 = 6435
systems (7  7) of linear algebraic equations, i.e., there are 6435 dierent ways of choosing these unknowns. of
this grand total possible solutions, 4113 yield trivial solutions and for this reason present no interest at all. yet, the
remaining 2322 solutions are quite a big number! fortunately, not all the remnant non-vanishing solutions need to
be considered in order to solve the feynman integral. in fact, only linearly independent series will be needed. in
our massless case and where there is only one non-vanishing external momentum, the argument of such series is unit.
since ndim provides, in general, hypergeometric series (see, for example ref. [8] where we have double and triple
series of such), we obtain in this case pfq(   |1), and from the theory of generalized hypergeometric functions [13,14],
a linear combination of linearly independent series of this type has up to p series.

consider then, the solution where the indices y2, y3, y4, y5, y7, y8, y9, z2 are left undetermined. solving this system

we get,

2

x1 = l + m + n  s + y2 + y3 + y4  y5  y8 + z2 ,
x2 = i + l + n + d/2  y2  y9 + y5 + y7 + z2 ,
x3 = j + l + s + d/2  y4  z2 ,
x4 = n + s  y3  y7 + y8 + y9  z2 ,
y1 = m  n  d/2  y2  y3  y4  z2 ,
y6 =  + m  y5  y7 ,
z1 = n  y8  y9 ,

(7)

which substituted in (6) yields an eight-fold summation. seven of these can be rewritten in terms of gamma functions.
the procedure is as follows: firstly, the factorials must be converted into gamma functions and these into pochhammer
symbols, dened by,

(n|k)  (n)k =

(n + k)

(n)

.

secondly, use the properties,

(n|j + k) = (n + j|k)(n|j),

(n|  k) =

(1)k

(1  n|k)

,

(8)

(9)

which follow from the denition above. then, it is possible to rewrite some series in terms of gaussian hypergeometric
functions, which can, in general, be summed when its argument is unit [12].

2f1(a, b; c|1) =

(c)(c  a  b)
(c  a)(c  b)

.

(10)

exception for this occurs when the parameters are such that c  a  b = 0.

therefore, if we rearrange these series conveniently, we can sum them, and applying this procedure for the series
dened by indices y4, y3, y2, y8, y9, y7, y5, they all can be summed out. the last series, dened by index z2, however
cannot be summed in this fashion since it is a 3f2 function, which is summable only when it is of saalschutzian type
[13], and this is not our present case.

many of the gamma functions that appear in this process simplify among themselves and in the end, what remains
are fourteen gamma functions distributed in a fraction, i.e., seven in the numerator and seven in the denominator
multiplying the z2 series. this is the result in the negative dimension region and positive exponents (i, j, l, m, n, s),
see (4). now we must be able to bring this result back, that is, analytically continue it, to our real physical world,
that of positive d. this is carried out very easily: group the gamma functions in convenient pochhammer symbols
and use the second property (9).

considering now the

solution where x1, x2, x3, y1, y5, y6, y9, z2 are

left undetermined, we get another
3f2(a, b, c; e, f |z) function. let us recall that such functions have three singular points, namely (0, 1, ). here,
we are interested in solutions in the vicinity of z = 1. no/rlund [15] proved that when the dierence between e and f
is an integer, some of the series concide or are without meaning. this is precisely our case. this means that our nal
result for the feynman integral shall exhibit only two linearly independent generalized hypergeometric functions of
the type 3f2, instead of the usual three. we get, as a result, then

n dim = d(p2){a 3f2(a1, b1, c1; e1, f1|1) + b 3f2(a
s 1

1|1)}

1, b

1, c

1; e

1, f 

where

and

a  (m|)( + d/2|  2  d/2)(j|j + l + s + d/2)(l|j + l + s + d/2)

 (i  j  l  s  d/2|i)(j + l + s + d|  j  l  s  d/2 + m + n),

(11)

(12)

b  (i|)(m|)( + d/2|  2  d/2)

 (j|  l  s  d/2)(j + l + s + d|  j  d/2)(l  s|j + l + s + d/2),

(13)

where the set of parameters are dened as (a1, b1, c1; e1, f1) = (s, m + n + d/2, j  l  s  d/2; i  j  l  s 
d/2, 1  j  s  d/2), and (a
1) = (, l, j  l  s  d/2; l  s, 1 + i  ). note that (e1  f1) is

1, f 

1; e

an integer. observe also that, in the special case where all the exponents are equal to minus one, the hypergeometric
function 3f2 reduces to 2f1, which can be summed again, using (10). so, for this special case of negative unity
exponents, the nal result is expressed in terms of gamma functions only.

let us point out here that our nal result agrees with that given by davydychev and osland [11], i.e., meaning
that equation (27) in ref. [1] disagrees with ours. the dierence is in the 9(4) factor in [1] which should correctly be
read 9(2). this gives the correct result for i = j = l = m = n = s = 1 and d = 4  2.

iii. results for some two and three-loop massless scalar integrals.

the scalar integrals for the remaining diagrams (fig.2-7) are, in negative d, given by (number superscripts 2-7

label the corresponding diagrams):

s 2

n dim = z ddq ddr (r2)i(q2)j (p + r)2l(q + k)2m(p + r  q)2n,

s 3

n dim = z ddq ddr (r2)i(q2)j(k  q  r)2l(k  r)2m(r + p)2n,

s 4

n dim = z ddq ddr ddk (r2)i(k2)j(q2)l(p  q  r)2m(r  k)2n,

s 5

n dim = z ddq ddr ddk (q2)i(k2)j (r2)l(p  r)2m(r  q)2n(p  r  k)2s,

s 6

n dim = z ddq ddr ddk (r2)i(k2)j (q2)l(r + k)2m(p  k  r)2n(r + k  q)2s,

and

s 7

n dim = z ddk ddq ddr (q2)i(k2)j (p  k  r)2l(k  q)2m(p  k)2n(r2)s.

all these can be evaluated in a similar way following the steps of the previous section. for this reason we quote

here only the nal results, after continuation to positive dimension and negative exponents of propagators:

n dim = d(k2){c 3f2(a2, b2, c2; e2, f2|1) + d 3f2(a

(22)

with the set of parameters dened by (a2, b2, c2; e2, f2) = (m, i+d/2, jmnd/2; i+d/2, 1mnd/2)
and (a
2) = (j, , j  m  n  d/2; 1 + l  , j  m) and  =   s. note that here also we have a
linear combination of two 3f2 hypergeometric functions, since (e2  f2) is an integer and no/rlunds theorem applies.

note that this result contains a special case (for m = 0) calculated numerically in [16]. our result, on the other
hand, was analytically obtained and is more general, since the exponents of propagators are arbitrary (cf. results in
the second reference in [5]).

iv. conclusion.

although ndim is not a regularization method, it shares all the concepts of dimensional regularization since it is
based on the principle of analytic continuation in the dimension of space-time. in this work we showed that with an
adequate technique such as ndim it is possible to calculate some two- and three-loop feynman integrals with relative
easiness and without much elaborate machinery, just the performance of some gaussian-type integrals plus resolution
of systems of linear algebraic equations. of course, in view of the great number of systems of linear algebraic equations
that are involved, we need the help of computer facilities, but the task is simple, which a pc can handle properly.

the results we obtained can be used to study on-shell form factors in massless qcd at the two-loop level. moreover,
to illustrate how ndim works beyond two-loops, we also performed some calculations of scalar three-loop, two-point
integrals with arbitrary exponents for propagators and dimension, in euclidean space.
