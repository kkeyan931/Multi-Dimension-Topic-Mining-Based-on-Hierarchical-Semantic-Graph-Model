we study the quantum mechanical model obtained as a dimensional reduction of
n = 1 super yang-mills theory to a periodic light cone time. after mapping the theory
to a cohomological eld theory, the partition function (with periodic boundary conditions)
regularized by a massive term appears to be equal to the partition function of the twisted
matrix oscillator. we show that this partition function perturbed by the operator of the
holonomy around the time circle is a tau function of toda hierarchy. we solve the model
in the large n limit and study the universal properties of the solution in the scaling limit
of vanishing perturbation. we nd in this limit a phase transition of gross-witten type.

1. introduction

the supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theories have rich physical content and their
quantitative analysis is in general as dicult as in the usual, nonsupersymmetric, gauge
theories. however they often contain, unlike the purely bosonic ym theories, specic
sectors, which can be analysed exactly and where the supersymmetry leads to a nilpotent
(topological) symmetry [1]. the dimensionally reduced versions of the sym theory even
allow various massive deformations conserving this symmetry.

in refs.

[2] and [3] this symmetry (in the zero dimensional reductions of sym) was
applied for the calculation of the (bulk part of the) witten index for ensembles of n 0-
branes in 4, 6 and 10 dimensions, justifying the conjectures related to the existence of
bound states of zero-branes [4]. in [5] the method was applied to study certain correlators
of bps states or, in other words, of perturbations of the original reduced sym theories,
which preserve part of the supersymmetry. in the case of the zero dimensional reduction
of n = 1 sym theory, the large n limit was studied exactly using the method of [6] or by
the corresponding integrability properties allowing to write an explicit (kp) dierential
equation for the partition function. one of the unexpected results was that, in the large
n limit, the physical quantities exhibit an essential singularity at  = 0, where  is the
coupling of the massive perturbation. the large n limit of the dimensionally reduced sym
theories is also interesting because it may reveal part of the structure of the nonreduced
theories, due to the eguchi-kawai mechanism.

in this paper we study the one dimensional reduction of the n = 1 su (n ) pure yang-
mills theory. unlike the well known and widely used 1d reduction to the usual physical
time [6], [7], or [8], we will retain the time along the light cone direction compactied
on a circle of radius . only this reduction allows the direct use of wittens localization
principle [1]1. in order to get rid of the zero modes of the bosonic elds we will deform
the theory by a massive perturbation corresponding to the o(2) twisting of the boundary
conditions on the time circle with respect to a subgroup of the euclidean symmetry o(4).
the sym theory reduced in this way appears to be identical to the compactied hermitian
matrix oscillator with su (n )-twisted boundary conditions. the twisting angles are related
to a global mode of the (time-like) gauge eld. this model can be further reduced to that
of a unitary (already time-independent) twist matrix. we nd that the model is integrable
in the sense that its partition function is a tau-function of toda hierarchy, i.e. it obeys a
chain of nonlinear toda equations.

the model can be solved exactly and rather explicitly in the large n limit. the
solution of the corresponding saddle point equation and its physical consequences in the
limit of vanishing perturbation represent the main result of this paper. the solution is
parametrized in terms of elliptic functions. the analysis of the solution as a function of
the two parameters  and , where  is the compactication length,  is the strength of
the massive perturbation, and  is the twist coupling reveals the following phenomena:
1. in the double limit   0,   0 the free energy is universal (under certain deformations)
function of the ratio /.
in the limit of vanishing massive perturbation (  0), the observables exhibit an
2.

essential singularity  exp(cid:0) const
 (cid:1).

1 our argument follows essentially the construction proposed in [9,10], which allows to lift by
one the dimension of the spacetime without loosing the supersymmetry. technically speaking, our

procedure of dimensional reduction replaces the euclidean spacetime by a point and at the same

time introduces the time dimension  . the latter might be interpreted as a lightlike dimension

of the original spacetime, but we do not know to what extent this interpretation is justied.

3. the analytical continuation of the model at the point  = i (inverted oscillator)
shows the scaling of the c = 1 compactied noncritical string theory. this value of the
compactication length  corresponds to the kosterlitz-thouless critical point (see ap-
pendix c).

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we describe the reduction of the
partition function of the one-dimensionally reduced n = 1 sym4 theory to that of the
reduced twisted matrix oscillator, by the use of the supersymmetry and the localization
theorem. we then reduce the conguration space of the model to the set of the eigenvalues
of the unitary twist matrix. in section 3 we nd that the partition function of our model is a
 function of the toda integrable hierarchy and write the dierential equations satised by
the partition grand canonical function. in section 4 we give an exact solution of the saddle
point equation for the large n limit of the model in terms of elliptic parametrization; the
calculations are presented in appendix a. in section 5 we study the limit of small massive
perturbation. we nd an universal expression for the free energy in presence of a source
for the wilson loops, in the scaling limit   0 and   0. we analyse the properties
of the solution, especially in the small compactication radius limit and near the curve of
the gross-witten type transitions. section 6 is devoted to conclusions. in appendix c
we give the solution of the analytic continuation of our model to imaginary time  = i,
which is the kosterlitz-thouless point for the corresponding c = 1 noncritical string.

2. denition of the model and its reduction to one-dimensional matrix quan-
tum mechanics

in this section we will show that the dimensionally reduced n = 1 super yang-
mills theory with gauge group su (n ) can be mapped to one-dimensional matrix quantum
mechanics. the dimensional reduction consists in replacing the 4-dimensional (euclidean)
space-time by a single lightlike time.

let us rst give the generalization of the argument of [5] to the case of one dimension.
we start with the the n = 1 su (n ) sym4 containing 4 bosonic matrix elds a ( =
0, 1, 2, 3), and 4 real fermionic elds  ( = 1, . . . , 4). after performing a wick rotation
x0 = ix4, the action of the euclidean theory can be written as

s =z d4xtr(cid:18)

f 2

t (4 + ~  ~)(cid:19) ,

(2.1)

where  = i + a is the covariant derivative and the gamma-matrices are represented
as direct products of pauli matrices: i = i  i (i = 1, 2, 3). the gauge group su (n )
acts to all elds in the adjoint representation. let us assume that all elds depend only on
the time-like coordinate

 = x3  ix4,

(2.2)

which parametrizes a circle with radius . the resulting model is a matrix quantum
mechanics containing four bosonic and four fermionic matrix variables.

we will evaluate the functional integral for this one-dimensional matrix model by
mapping it to a cohomological eld theory, which will allow to apply wittens localization
argument [11]. let us redene the elds as

(2.3)

then the action (2.1) can be written as a brst exact form. the brst transformation q
acts on the complex of elds  = {xa, , , h; a, , } (where h = i[x1, x2] is considered
as an auxilliary eld ) as

qxa = a,
q  = ,

qa = [i + , x]
q = [i + , ]

(a = 1, 2)

q = h,

qh = [i + , ]

q = 0.

the square q2 of this transformation represents the time gauge transformation generated
by ,  = [i + ,
]. hence q is nilpotent on the gauge-invariant quantities. the ghost
number of the elds is 2 for , 1 for  and , 0 for xa and h, +1 for a, and +2 for .

(2.6)

(where the integration measure is normalized by the volume of the gauge group g) can be
therefore evaluated using the wittens localization argument [11]. namely, the integral is
saturated by the brst critical points q = 0. more strictly, we have to integrate over
a continuous critical manifold, because of the zero modes of , , . the zero modes are
elliminated by adding, following [11], a q-exact term to the action (2.5) by changing the
action to s + s, with

we can also discard from the very beginning, the term 1
be integrated out by setting h = t  + [x1, x2] in (2.5). the advantage of introducing
the perturbation (2.7) is that for t 6= 0, the elds , , and  can be integrated out.
however, the perturbed integral does not coinside in general with the original one because
of the new xed points owing in from the innity  when one perturbes to t 6= 0

[11]. the correct statement is that there exists a class of brst-invariant operators whose

does not depend on the coupling t. indeed, taking the derivative in t and integrating by
parts, we nd zero, since the integrand vanishes at innity due to the factor e. therefore
we can take the limit t  , after which the integral (2.10) gets localized near the zeros
of h, , , . (in particular, the partition function does not depend on the gauge coupling
g.) now we can calculate the partition function (2.6) understood as the average of the
identity operator. since  has ghost number +2, due to the ghost number conservation

zn (, g)  h1i = hei.

(2.11)

the above argument has been applied recently by f. sugino [12] in order to calculate the
partition function of the four-dimensional n = 1 sym reduced to a two-dimensional torus,
with periodic boundary conditions for all elds. our case is slightly more subtle, because
of the zero modes of the elds xa. these zero modes will be elliminated, as in [3] and
later in [5], namely by deforming the brst operator in the denition of the action (2.5).
let us rst notice that after the redenition of the elds the theory is still invariant under
the o(2) rotations in the directions orthogonal to the light cone:

x1 + ix2  ei (x1 + ix2) , 1 + i2  ei (1 + i2) .

this allows to construct another brst operator, which squares to a linear combination
of a gauge transformation and an o(2) rotation. the twisted brst charge q acts as

qx = ,
q  = ,

q = [i + , x] + ix,
q = [i + , ]

q = h,

qh = [i + , ]

q = 0.

(2.12)

the modication of the supercharge is equivalent to changing the action (2.5) and the
operator (2.8) as

2 (x 2

1 + x 2

2 ) + 12(cid:1) ,

(2.14)

and the s can then be integrated out. finally, the integration over x2 gives the partition
function of the matrix oscillator (with the coordinate x1  x) in presence of the one-
dimensional gauge eld ( )

depends on  and  only through the product . we will absorb  in ,

(2.16)

remembering that the perturbation is lifted in the limit   0.
the functional integral over the eld  can be written, after xing a gauge   = 0, as
an integral over the unitary matrix2 representing holonomy factor dened by (2.9), namely
 = ei normalized by the volume of u (n ). the holonomy factor enters the functional
integral over x as the twisted boundary condition:

x() = +x(0).

(2.17)

the integral over x can be performed exactly, and the integral over the unitary matrix 
reduces to an integral over its eigenvalues ei1 , ..., ein (which are dened up to a permu-
tation, hence a combinatorial factor 1/n !). the partition function is therefore given by

2 it is assumed that the integration contour for the eigenvalues of  is chosen along the real

axis. in this case  should be taken anti-hermitian, see the the discussion in [11].

3 this happens to be exactly the partition function of the one-dimensional gas studied by
michel gaudin in 1966 [13]; it was extensively used in [14] to study the compactied 1+1 dimen-

sional string theory via matrix quantum mechanics; in relation to the actual sym theory this

formula was communicated to us by n. nekrasov.

where the ()f -factor is included in order to impose the periodic boundary conditions on
the fermionic elds, and the trace is twisted by an o(2) rotation eij in the (12) plane.
the twisting of the brst charge q  q does not change locally the functional integral,
but it does change the boundary conditions for the elds.
now we are at the most subtle point of the reduction procedure, which deserves to
be discussed in more detail. considering the elds  and  as two independent elds
imply that the integration over them is understood as contour integration. the twisting
separates the poles and zeroes of the integrand and allows to evaluate the integral by the
residue theorem, in complete similarity with the calculation of [3] for the zero dimensional
model. since the integrand does not depend on the variable

 =

1 + ... + n

n

,

the contour integral with respect to this variable would give zero. in fact, the integration
with respect to this variable should be excluded because this is one of the normalizable
zero modes of the original elds and the measure d should contain a product of delta
functions of the bosonic and fermionic zero modes. in particular, the normalized zero mode
of  is

(0) =

1

n  z 

0

d tr( ) =pn  .

for a more detailed discussion see [15]. therefore the measure in (2.18) contains a delta
function ((0))  (1 + ... + n ), which suppresses the contour integration with respect
to . the integral over s is normalized by the volume of the residual global gauge group.
the introduction of the delta function should respect this normalization. thus we have to
insert

2() = 2n (1 + ... + n ).

now we can integrate, after representing the integrand as a determinant using the cauchy
identity, by using the residues theorem. the integral is equal to the sum of the identical
contributions of the (n  1)! cyclic permutations in the expansion of the determinant

to reproduce also the numerical coecient, in accordance with the conjecture made in [16].
in the limit   0, the -integral is saturated by the integration in the vicinity of the
n central elements of su (n ) which are parametrized by the element of the su(n ) lie
algebra [17]. after performing carefully the limit, one nds (see e.g. [15])

duces the result of [3]:

n (g) is the partition function of the completely reduced theory, and one repro-

z (0)
n (g) = fn g 1

2 (n 21) 1
n 2 .

(2.21)

(the numerical factor fn depends on the way the integration measure is normalized. in
the normalization used in [3] this factor is equal to one, but this is not the most natural
choice from the point of view of applications to the d-brane physics.) in the particular
case of the su (2) theory the results was obtaind by the direct calculation of the integrals
[18].

let us note that our partition function only formally coincides with that of the twisted
matrix oscillator and, at least for nite n , there is an ambiguity related to the prescription
for the contour integration. wittens localization procedure leads to an integral over the
lie algebra and logically the integration with respect to s should be taken along the whole
real axis. with this denition, only (n  1)! terms in the expansion of the determinant
will contribute to it. on the other hand, had we integrate in interval [0, 2], this would
correspond to contour integration with respect to the eigenvalues of the lie group element
{tk = eik}n
k=1, where the contours circle the origin. in this case we would get contributions
from all n ! terms in the expansion of the cauchy determinant. the result would be given,
instead of (2.20), by (see, for example, ref. [14])

zn () =

en 2/2

(1  e)(1  e2)...(1  en)

.

(2.22)

unlike (2.20), the   0 limit of this formula does not match the result of [3].
which of the two formulas (2.20) or (2.22) is correct? clearly the dierence between
them is due to a dierent treatment of the boundary conditions for the eld  in the formula
(2.15). result considered then at hermitean oscillators). a happy resolution of this paradox
would be that from the point of view of the application of wittens localisation principle
both formulas seem to be possible but the result depends on the boundary conditions and
the contours of integration for the eld (t) in the original action (2.5). however we feel
that the question is rather subtle and more study is needed to clarify it. for example we
cannot be sure that the supersymmetry of the original model isnt violated in one of two
cases. on the other hand, the local brst symmetry used for the calculations is certainly
intact.

now let us consider a slightly more ambitious problem, namely to calculate the gen-
erating functional of a set of brst invariant operators made out of the gauge eld .
as mentioned before, such operators can be constructed as traces of the holonomy  in
dierent representations, or, equivalently, as polynomials of the moments tr()k. we will
add to the action the simplest possible source term

tr(+ + ).

(2.23)

repeating the arguments, which led to (2.18), we nd for the generating functional the
following integral representation

zn (, ) =

1

n !i

dk
2

n

yk=1

en cos k yi6=j

2 (i  j)]

sin[ 1
2 (i  j + i)]

sin[ 1

(2.24)

where i = i. if one follows the recipe of [3], the integration should be considered as
a contour integration along the real axis, where the n integration variables are subjected

7

to the constraint 1 + ... + n = 0. then the result should be analytic as a function
of , which can therefore be given complex values.
it is plausible that in the large n
limit, which we are interested in, if the perturbation is suciently strong, the choice of the
contours should be not important. the equivalence between the reduces sym theory and
the twisted matrix oscillator should takes place only in this limit.

it would be very interesting to understand what is the meaning, in terms of the original
supersymmetric theory (2.1), of the deformation that leads to the partition function (2.23).
the reduction from 4 to 1 dimension of the original theory turns three of the compo-
nents of the gauge eld into higgs elds (x1, x2 and ). this makes the direct calculation
of the partition function (which is related to the bulk part of the witten index) more
delicate, because of the absence of mass gap. by introducing the deformations (2.7), (2.8)
and (2.13) we add an additional higgs potential, thus breaking part of the supersymmetry.
the eect of the source term, which we added to obtain the partition function (2.23), de-
pends substantially on the way we have perturbed the theory. indeed, it has positive ghost
charge, and its eect would be zero, if the perturbation (2.13) of ghost charge 2 were not
there to compensate it. this is also true in the completely reduced theory, discussed in
ref. [5].

3. the partition function as a tau-function of the toda hierarchy

here we will show that our partition function with a source term tr(+ + ) is a
tau-function of discrete toda chain. let us rewrite the partition function of the model
eq.(2.24) in the following form:

zn (, t) =

1

n !i

dzj
2

n

yj=1

eu(zj )

2(z)

qk,m(e/2zm  e/2zk)

(3.1)

where zk = eik , u (z) = pn6=0 tnzn, and (z) is the van-der-monde determinant of zs.
in our case t1 = t1 = n  and tn = 0 for n 6= 1, but most of the following conclusions
are true for a general u (z).

let us now introduce the grand canonical partition function with the charge l:

l[t, ] =



xn=1

en elnzn (, t)

(3.2)

due to the cauchy identity the last equation can be rewritten in terms of a functional
fredholm determinant:

l[t, ] =



xn=1

where the operator k is dened as

( kf )(z) =i dz

2

2 [u(z)+u(z  )]

e

e/2z  e/2z f (z).

8

it is convenient to modify slightly the denition of the tau-function:

l[t, ] = l[t, ] exp(xn>0

ntntn),

where we introduced new couplings tn by:

u (z) = xn6=0

zntn(en/2  en/2)

so that the old couplings are expressed through the new ones as:

we also note that

tn = tn(en/2  en/2).

l[t, ] = 0[t,   l]   [t,   l].

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

using, for example, the general construction of the paper [19] for our particular tau-
function we conclude that it is a particular case of the tau-function of toda hierarchy. it
satises the toda chain equations. namely let us introduce a new function

and the notations

el =

l1
l

=

 [t,   (l  1)]

 [t,   l]

ix = 2t1 = (e/2  e/2)1t1.

the rst equation of the toda hierarchy can be written as





x+

x

l +

1

2(cid:0)ell+1  el1l(cid:1) = 0

(3.8)

(3.9)

due to the symmetry    of the measure our tau-function depends only on the

variable x = x+x. the corresponding reduced equation is:



l +

1
x



l +

1

2(cid:0)ell+1  el1l(cid:1) = 0,

where the derivatives are taken with respect to x.
for the function l = l  l+1 = log l1l+1

the toda equation reads:

the tau-function, as well as l(0) and l(0), can be determined for x = 0 using the
methods of [14] (for x = 0 the tau-function is the grand canonical partition function of the
matrix oscillator in the singlet representation of the u (n ) group, which is the same as the

9

partition function of n fermionic oscillators) and it can serve as a boundary condition for
the toda chain equation. for example, one nds from (2.22)

el(0) =

1 + e(l3/2)
1 + e(l1/2) .

(3.12)

let us also note that l(x) is analytic in x2 at the origin, which gives the second initial
condition xl|x=0 = 0.

this is the simplest correlation function htr+tri of the holonomy wilson loop in
the large n limit of the initial partition function (2.24) or (3.1) can be studied in
terms of a special scaling limit of these toda equations (since   n in the legendre trans-
form from canonical to microcanonical partition function), similar to the kp-hierarchy
approach of a simpler zero-dimensional model of paper [5]. we leave this study to a future
publication.

4. saddle point equations in the large n limit

in this section we will investigate the large n limit, which is the most interesting from
the point of view of applications. since the potential  cos  is symmetric, we assume that
the saddle-point spectral density

5. scaling limit

5.1. the resolvent in the scaling limit

let us recall that the parameter  is the product of the physical time and the twisting
parameter . therefore the twisting is removed in the limit   0. if   0 with  xed,
we reproduce the zero-dimensional case considered in [5]. in this section we will consider
a nontrivial limit where both  and  go to zero so that the ratio / remains nite. in
this limit, all observables depend only on the ratio /, and this is why we call it the
scaling limit. note that in the thermodynamical limit n  , the two limits   0 and
  0 will not commute.
4 ) and, neglecting
the exponentially small terms, we get

in the scaling limit we have im >> 1, k  ln 4

5.2. the free energy in the scaling limit

we have

(z) = ey +

xk=1

 (k) e(2k+1)y.

f 

(, ) =



8 sinh2 
2

[ (1)  1].

(5.5)

the coecient  (1) is evaluated in the scaling limit   0 in appendix a. this allows us
to write an explicit expression for the free energy in the limit   0:

f 

(/) =



(4v  sin 4v ),



4

= sin 2v  2v cos 2v .

(5.6)




this expression for the free energy is universal in a certain sense:
potential (2.23) to a more general one:

if one deforms the



tnn,

(5.7)

tr

xn=

then the scaling limit of the free energy will have the same form (5.6), where  will be
substituted by some function of the couplings (g1, g2,   ). the universal form of the free
energy can only change if we tune the couplings gn to some multicritical point.
the corrections to the eq. (5.6) are of two kinds: power-like corrections and exponen-

tially small terms of the type

q = e4v /.

2 (cid:17)1/3

in the limit    we have q = exp(cid:16) 244
. these terms are of course invisible com-
pared with the power-like corrections but they imply the existence of essential singularity
in the   0.
if we return to the original notations in terms of , and  we conclude from (5.6) that
f (, , ) = f (/()). hence the principal  n 2 correction to the free energy tends to
zero in the limit   0 (when we recover the original unperturbed reduced sym theory).
on the other hand, as we will see below from (5.6), there is no regular expansion in powers
of  in the weak coupling phase which signies that there is an essential singularity at the
origin of this coupling and, correspondingly, in the moduli space of our theory.

5.3. the gross-witten phase transition and the strong coupling phase

the matrix integral we are considering has qualitatively the same phase structure as
the u () gauge theory on a two-dimensional sphere. the weak coupling phase considered
above, describes the range of couplings  > c where

c =

1  e



(5.8)

is determined by from the condition a = , i.e. that the two endpoints of the cut meet on
the unit circle. (eq. (5.8) follows from (5.3) with v = /2; the length of the cut as a
function of  is given in appendix a.) the singularity near this critical point is as usual
of third order.

the strong coupling solution is obtained by expanding the spectral density and the

kernel in a fourier series

it is therefore clear that only the c0 term of the expansion of the spectral density has

to be retained. one nds

in the scaling limit   0 we obtain: f

weak coupling phase  > c the same values of rst two derivatives of the free energy at
the critical point. this means that we have, as usually, the 3-rd order gross-witten phase
transition. note that in the limit    our model reduces indeed to the one-plaquette
model originally studied by gross and witten [20].

5.4. reduction to the zero-dimensional theory:  << 

in this limit the theory appears to be the zero-dimensional reduction of cn = 1 sym

we nd from (5.6) the following expansions in half-length of the cut a = 2v :

the rst term of this expansion matches the asymptotics of big  obtained in [5] for the
integral (5.11) in the large n limit. the next terms are not supposed to match with
[5] since we already used the scaling limit expression of the free energy with the nite
compactication radius .

6. conclusions

let us outline the main results of the paper:

1. we consider a topological sector of the one-dimensionally reduced n = 1 sy m4 theory
on the light-cone time circle with a a special massive perturbation. using wittens non-
abelian localisation principle [11], we represented the partition function with periodic b.c.
in terms of a solvable matrix quantum mechanics (twisted matrix oscillator).
2. we nd the integrability properties of this model relating it to the toda hierarchy. the
generating functional as a function of its parameters satises the toda chain equation.
3. in the large n limit we nd the exact solution of the model: the generating functional is
parametrized in terms of elliptic functions. we nd the gross-witten type phase transition
and identify its location. the strong coupling solution is also found.
4. an interesting model corresponds to the analytical continuation   i (inverted
matrix oscillator) being known to have the properties of the c = 1 non-critical strings.
5. in the scaling limit of vanishing perturbation we nd a simple universal (with respect
to certain deformations of parameters of the generating functional) expression for the free
energy and wilson loop correlators along the light-cone circle. its strong compactication
limit restores similar results for the completely reduced n = 1 sy m4 considered in [5].
1. we need further understanding of the space time symmetries of the model and of the
correlators corresponding to our generating functional.
2. the representations similar to the eq.(2.24) for the sy m4 can be found also for the
sy m6 and sy m10 reduced to the light-cone time circle: we just have to take the cor-
responding eigenvalue integrals for the partition functions in the paper [5]and substitute
there the rational functions by trigonometric ones. unfortunately, we cannot apply the
powerful methods used here to those models: we dont know any relation of them to the
integrable hierarchies and we cannot solve exactly the large n saddle point equation. on
the other hand, it seems to be possible to investigate this saddle point equation in the
scaling limit similar to tha used in the present paper.

some remaining problems:

another interesting question is whether two prescriptions for the contour integration
with respect to the eigenvalues of  coincide for the innite n in some part of the phase
space of parameters  and . it is clear that they give dierent answers in the strong

15

coupling phase  < c() (since they are already dierent for  = 0). as for the weak
coupling phase  > c() of our large n solution (which is not even analytical at  = 0), it
is possible that the saddle point approximation does not distinguish between two dierent
prescriptions of integration over (t) (contour integration over the cartan subalgebra, on
the one hand, and integration over s in the nite interval [0, 2], on the other hand).
this hypothesis is to be veried. a weaker version of it could be the coincidence of two
prescriptions in the scaling limit (eq. (5.6)).

a map of the half strip 0 < rez < , imz > 0 with a cut [ i
2  + a], to the upper half
plane im > 0 (fig. 1). the inverse map z = z() is given by the schwarz-christoel

as is shown in the two rst coloumns of table 1.
the values of  at the special points of the map are determined as functions of  and
 by the assymptotics of (z) at innity. the expansion of the function (4.5) at z  
contains only odd powers of eiz.
if we approach innity as z =  + iy, y  , the
asymptotics of (z) is

appendix c. inverted oscillator: the point  = i

an interesting analytical continuation of our model corresponds to the imaginary
values of the generator of o(2) symmetry of the original supersymmetric model. if we
renormalise  to one it is equivalent to the change   i in (2.24). the corresponding
saddle point equation reads:

2 sin u =z a

adu(u)(cid:18)2 cot

u  u

2  cot

u  u + 

2

 cot

u  u

(cid:19)

(c.1)

according to the arguments and results of the paper [14] the inverted twisted matrix
oscillator describes the compactied c = 1 string, or, in other words, the compactied
bosonic eld coupled to the 2d quantum gravity. so at least the critical regime of c = 1
string with the typical inverse logarithmic dependence of the physical quantities on the
cosmological coupling should show up at some point. let us demonstrate it in the case
which we can solve explicitly, namely for  = i. the equation (c.1) in this case looks as:


2

sin u =z a
a du

(u)

sin(u  u)

.

(c.2)

the spectral density is

(u) =

k = sin a.

(c.3)

consider the limit when the eigenvalues occupy almost the whole interval [, ] allowed
by the periodicity: a  , k2  1. in terms of k we have the following assymptotics:

e  1 +

1
2

k2 log(4/k)

k  log(4/k)
by the use of (c.4)and (c.5)we obtain from (c.3):

k2

for   c = .

for the simplest physical quantity: the derivative of the free energy we obtain:

f

a

du(u) cos u =

(c.4)

(c.5)

(c.6)

(c.7)

from where we obtain the scaling asymptotics typical for the c = 1 noncritical string
discovered in [23]:

(  c)2
| log(  c)|

(c.8)

the considered case  = i of the c = 1 matrix model corresponds to the kosterlitz-
thouless phase transition point. it would be interesting to study the vicinity of this point
by generalizing our solution to all imaginary .
