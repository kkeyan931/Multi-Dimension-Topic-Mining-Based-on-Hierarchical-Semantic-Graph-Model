(several concepts crucial light-like formulation recognized earlier ref. {$9905177$}.) generalizing simple example shown fig. 1b, easy see fact every 2-dimensional surface, regardless shape size, bounds exactly four null hypersurfaces. may contructed following past- future-directed orthogonal lightrays leaving surface either side. four selected entropy bound? far light-rays followed? 3.2. go inside fs {$9905177$} considered spherical areas proposed past-directed ingoing null hypersurface used. resulting entropy bound works well large regions diers conservative approach taken refs. {$9905177$} aimed establish range validity bekenstein bound certain cosmological solutions. formalism able resolve interesting question special case (see sec. 5). k surface mean surface xed time, i.e., 2-dimensional spatial submanifold. mean history surface (which would 2 + 1-dimensional). holographic principle general backgrounds 4 time space v 1 v2 (a) (b) (c) (d1) (d2) (d3) figure 1.  spatial volume v enclosed surface depends time slicing (a). thus original formulation holographic principle covariant. however, 2d boundary four 2+1d light-like hypersurfaces (b). covariantly generated past- future-directed light-rays going either side a. e.g., normal spherical surface given two cones two skirts (b). penrose diagram, spheres represented points, associated null hypersurfaces show 4 legs x (c). null hypersurfaces decreasing cross-sectional area, two cones (b), called light-sheets. entropy passing cannot exceed a/4 (covariant entropy bound). light-sheets normal (d1), trapped (d2), anti-trapped (d3) gravity weak, (b), light-sheet spherical surfaces shown. directions agree intuitive notion inside (d1). surfaces black hole interior, future-directed hypersurfaces collapse (d2). near big bang, cosmological expansion means area decreases past-directed hypersurfaces (d3). closed frw universes, bekenstein bound could applied. collapsing space-times, however, fs bound valid . root diculty lies ambiguity concept inside curved, dynamic space-times. closed surface asyptotically space, denition seems obvious: inside side innity not. space closed? example, side inside equatorial surface (an 2) three-sphere? propose dierent denition unambiguous, local, covariant. inside cross-sectional area decreases. consider two-sphere space (fig. 2a). let us pretend know side inside. make experiment nd out. measure area surface. now, move every point surface xed innitesimal distance along surface-orthogonal rays (radial rays case), one particular side. increases area, outside. area holographic principle general backgrounds decreased, gone inside.

corresponding argument relies assumptions taken denition presented fig. 3. time space l v figure 3. covariant bound implies bekenstein bound. consider closed surface a. expect bekenstein bound hold encloses spatial region v limited self-gravity. allows us make two assumptions. 1. possesses future-directed light-sheet l going side dened v (otherwise, v would contain trapped anti-trapped surfaces, implies strong gravity). 2. light- sheet l boundary a, i.e., closes center enclosed region (otherwise, space-time would end within light-crossing time, implies strong gravity). causality second law, entropy spatial region v (or more) must pass light-sheet; second assumption holes escape. therefore, s(v ) s(l). covariant bound, s(l) a/4. thus obtain bekenstein bound, s(v ) a/4. bound available (see sec. 1). given covariant bound, hand, necessity holographic interpretation much obvious. holographic principle general backgrounds 8 bekensteins limited self-gravity condition. immediate application, able settle controversial question received much attention {$9905177$}: cosmological solutions, largest surface bekensteins bound reliably applied? various types horizons suggested counter-examples found. established bekenstein bound holds surface permits complete, future-directed, ingoing light-sheet. singles apparent horizon, usually separates normal anti-trapped region. nevertheless, claim bekenstein bound holds apparent horizon {$9905177$} always valid {$9905177$}, since completeness condition must also satised {$9905177$}. yields precise formulation bekenstein bound special case, covariant entropy bound general. already stressed applies also open surfaces. moreover, valid strongly gravitating regions entropy bounds previously available (or even hoped for). illustration claim, let us test bound surfaces deep inside black hole. 5.2. trapped surfaces new type entropy bound one set worst-case scenario one considers horizon surface small black hole moment time. possesses future-directed light-sheet l coincide horizon long additional matter falls in. far outside black hole, may set highly enthropic shell arbitrary mass. order avoid angular caustics {$9905177$}, would terminate parts light-sheet, assume exact spherical symmetry. entropy carried radial modes arbitrarily large. shell allowed collapse around small black hole. reaches light-sheet, conguration already deep inside much larger black hole shell mass, conventional entropy bound applies. one might expect violation bound, since shell necessarily squeeze radius small black hole reach singularity center. dicult verify, however, light-sheet l ends entropy excess a/4 passes though {$9905177$}. shell entropy exceeds a/4, light-sheet reach r = 0 shell does. bound saturated, exceeded. thus see trapped surfaces, covariant formalism implies genuinely new entropy bounds, could anticipated original formulation. 5.3. closed universe particularly instructive verify covariant bound closed, matter-dominated frw universe, fs bound {$9905177$} could applied. consider small two- sphere near turn-around time (fig. 4a). fs bound would consider entropy light-cone traverses large part 3 space (fig. 4b). would almost entire entropy universe would exceed arbitrarily small area two-sphere. covariant bound, hand, considers entropy light- sheets directed towards smaller part (the polar cap). entropy vanishes holographic principle general backgrounds 9 two-sphere area goes zero {$9905177$}. illustrates power decreasing area rule. s3 s.p. ) 0 = ( future singularity ) = ( s2 n.p. e l p h u e l p h r n light-sheets fs (a) past singularity (b) (c) figure 4. closed frw universe. small two-sphere divides s3 spacelike sections two parts (a). covariant bound select small part, indicated normal wedges (see fig. 1d) near poles penrose diagram (b). slicing space-time stack light-cones, shown thin lines (c), information holographically projected towards tips wedges, onto embedded screen hypersurface (bold line). 5.4. questions proof details additional tests found ref. {$9905177$}. physical counterexample covariant entropy bound known (see appendix). conjecture proven? contrast bekenstein bound, covariant bound remains valid unstable systems, example interior black hole. precludes attempt derive purely second law. quite conversely, covariant bound formulated imply generalized second law {$9905177$}. fmw {$9905177$} able derive covariant bound either one two sets physically reasonable hypotheses entropy ux. eect, proof rules huge class conceivable counterexamples. hypothetical nature fmw axioms phenomenological description entropy, however, fmw proof mean one consider covariant bound follow strictly currently established laws physics {$9905177$}. view evidence suggest covariant holographic principle regarded fundamental. 6. boundary? world really hologram {$9409089$}? light-sheet formalism taught us associate entropy arbitrary 2d surfaces located anywhere spacetime. call space-time hologram, would like know whether, how, information (in entire, global 3+1-dimensional space-time) stored surfaces. example, anti-de sitter world known hologram . mean one-parameter family spatial surfaces (in case, holographic principle general backgrounds 10 two-sphere spatial innity, times time), bulk information stored density exceeding one bit per planck area. surfaces called screens spacetime. analogous screens found space-times? trick slice 3+1 space-time one parameter family 2+1 null hypersurfaces h( ). null hypersurface h( ), locate 2d spatial surface amax( ) maximum area. unless lies space-time boundary, surface divides h( ) two parts. cross-sectional area decreases directions away amax( ) construction. thus entropy entire hypersurface h( ) cannot exceed amax( )/2. words, physics h( ) described data stored amax( ) density exceeding 1 bit per planck area. repeating construction values parameter , one obtains one parameter family 2d screens, amax( ). forms 2+1 hypersurface a, embedded bulk space-time entire space-time information stored holographically. example, fig. 4c shows construction holographic screen hypersurface closed, matter-dominated frw universe. examples found ref. {$9906022$}. note depend choice slicing, always connected. minkowski space, one nds either one two null innities play role global screen. global de sitter, one must use past future innity; however, observable part de sitter encoded event horizon, forms null hypersurface nite area. 7. dreams holographic theory stunning success ads/cft duality {$9711200$} led speculations non- perturbative denition quantum gravity would involve theories holographic screens space-times well. hypotheses vague, however, general denition holographic screens available. particular, completely unclear holography could compatible space-times boundary, closed frw universe. shown embedded holographic screens exist space- time, construct them. result lends strong support holographic hypothesis. hope use search fully general, manifestly holographic unied theory. indeed, structure screens cosmological solutions provides interesting constraints general formulation holographic theories. generically, screen area (and thus number degrees freedom manifestly holographic theory dened screens) time-dependent. moreover, causal character screen hypersurface change repeatedly euclidean lorentzian. pathologies appear exclude possibility formulating well-dened, conventional theory screens. moreover, generalizing screen theory approach `a la ads one would encounter basic drawback screen must put hand, example constraining oneself asymptotically ads spaces. ideally, holographic principle general backgrounds 11 geometric features come theory. background-independent holographic theory likely require radical approach. suspect quantum gravity pre-geometric theory containing sector classical general relativity constructed. recovery local physics likely highly non-trivial, gleaned example ads/cft duality. one would need build geometry pre-geometric set degrees freedom way covariant holographic principle manifestly satised. would fundamental origin principle. appendix add comments generality covariant entropy bound. also discuss energy conditions respond recent criticism. classical gravity. covariant entropy bound applies physical solutions classical general relativity. constitutes enormous generalization compared previous formulations entropy bounds . obviously mean assume h exactly zero. rather, term classical refers space-times quantum gravitational eects negligible. holds known solutions, particular cosmology scales larger planck scale, ordinary thermodynamic systems, black holes time-scales less evaporation time. covariant entropy bound (and bekenstein bound, applicable) provides simple, yet highly non-trivial powerful relation area entropy space-times. renders nugatory observation lowe {$9906022$} bound, a/4gh, diverges h 0. quantum semi-classical gravity. holographic principle may hold key non-perturbative formulation string theory quantum gravity. mean expect remain useful strong quantum regime, approximation classical geometry need exist. indeed, concept area might become meaningless. argued above, fundamental role holographic principle would recovery classical relativity suitable sector pre-geometric unied theory. semi-classical gravity, however, ought place holographic principle. indeed, unaware semi-classical counter- examples covariant entropy bound. however, situation subtle classical gravity. easy construct apparent problems, turn stem limitations semi-classical description, holographic principle. consider, example, sphere outside black hole horizon. surface possesses future-directed light-sheet crosses horizon sweeps entire interior black hole. much entropy light-sheet? naively, might count rst bekenstein-hawking entropy horizon (a/4, saturates bound). addition, might count ordinary thermodynamic entropy matter formed black hole passes interior part holographic principle general backgrounds 12 light-sheet. would lead violation. breakdown holographic principle, however, naive interpretation semi-classical picture. overcounted. horizon entropy represents potential information content system observer outside black hole. matter entropy represents actual information observer falling in. viewpoints complementary, operationally meaningless take global stance count entropies. resolving lowes objection. lowe {$9906022$} argued covariant entropy bound {$9905177$} fails semi-classical black hole thermal equilibrium surrounding heatbath. considers surface black hole horizon, possesses future-directed outgoing light-sheet l. two assumptions made set-up {$9906022$}. 1) l coincide black hole horizon forever. 2) conguration stable thus eternal. second assumption, innite amount entropy crosses black hole horizon. rst assumption, entropy crosses light-sheet l nite area a. thus, would seem, bound violated. black holes negative specic heat, however, conguration fact unstable {$9905177$}. black hole decays runaway process accretion evaporation. invalidates lowes second assumption thus conclusion. static approximation used ref. {$9906022$} breaks completely within time order black hole evaporation time-scale, 3. time, bound satised, since black hole entropy, a/4, gets exchanged evaporation time.
