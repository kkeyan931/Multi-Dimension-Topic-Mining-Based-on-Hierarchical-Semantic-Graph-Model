(3) emergence non-zero entropy due following reason. one see dilaton eld (2) diverges horizon (r = 0). implies quantities related horizon receive large quantum correction, thus non-zero entropy could appear {$9603060$}. 2.2 d-brane description low energy eective theory d4-d4 intersection 3-dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric gauge thoery. gauge group u(q1)u(q2). three hyper- multiplets: one adjoint representation u(q1), one adjoint representation u(q2), one bi-fundamental representation u(q1)u(q2). d0-branes described bps monopoles, way d0-branes described instantons preserve half supersymmetries d4-d0 system {$9512077$}. simplest case, q1 = q2 = 1, adjoint hypermultiplets decouple dynamics resulting eective theory n = 4 supersymmetric qed charged hypermultiplet. bosonic part lagrangian sboson = z d3x (4) diq = iq iaiq, di q = q + iai q (i, j = 0, 1, 2, = 1, 2, 3), real scalars vector multiplet q, q complex scalars hypermultiplet. introduced fi-parameter . since ground states d4-d4- d0 system marginal bound states, may dicult investigate semiclassical argument. therefore deformed theory make states truly 3 bound states. expect deformation change drastically properties monopoles. similar arguments done {$9601029$}. eective theory (4) static monopole solutions known nielsen-olesen vortex {$9601029$}. solution breaks 4 supersymmetries, thus one-monopole solution 4(= 22) ground states. entropy d4-d4-d0 system obtaind counting ground states n monopoles. assume d4(d4)-branes separated other. number ground states equal number distributing n d0-branes among 2q1q2 bosonic states 2q1q2 fermionic states. easily calculated resulting entropy sstat = 2s 1 6 (2q1q2 + 1 2 2q1q2)n = 1 2 2qq1q2n (5) agrees (3) numerical factor. 3. generalized vortex consider q1, q2 1 case. again, simplicity, assume d4(d4)-branes separated other. corresponds gauge theory language turning vev adjoint hypermultiplet scalars, therefore gauge group u(q1)u(q2) broken u(1)q1 u(1)q2. seen q1 = q2 = 1 case, bps monopoles described gauge elds bi-fundamental hypermultiplet scalars. relevant part eective theory action therefore follows, g2 2 (d(1) n )2 g2|f (1) n |2) q1 q2 1 4g2 = z d3x, xn=1 + q1 q2 f (1) nij f (1)ij n g2 2 f (2) mijf (2)ij (d(2) )2 g2|f (2) |2) (i, j = 0, 1, 2) where, diqnm = iqnm + i(a(1) ni a(2) mi)qnm d(1) n = d(2) = + q2 q1 xm=1 xn=1 (|qnm|2 |qmn|2 ) (|qnm|2 |qmn|2 ) 4 (6) (7) 2 f (1) n = = +2 f (2) q2 q1 xm=1 xn=1 qnm qmn qmnqnm. ni a(2) a(1) fi-parameter introduced reason before. mi gauge elds cartan subalgebra u(q1) u(q2). first consider vacuum. suppose positive. vanishinig potential leads vacuum conguration. |qnm| = , qmn = 0 (8) monopole solutions must satisfy conditions spatial innity. investigate static bps monopole solutions preserve half supersymmetries. staic energy system f (1) nf (1) n + q1 e = z d2x, g2 2 (d(1) n )2) + q2 ( xm=1 1 4g2 f (2) mf (2) + g2 2 (d(2) )2) (, = 1, 2) set qmn = 0 everywhere. rewritten follows, q1 n )2 + q2 q1 1 2 f (1) n g2d(1) 1 e = z d2x xm=1 xn=1 xm=1z d2x(f (1) xn=1 n f (2) m) 1 2 + q1 q2 q2 xm=1 1 2g2 ( 1 2 f (2) )2 g2d(2) (9) (10) used dqnm 0 spatial innity. thus energy bounded below. bps equations then, n = 0 f (1) n g2d(1) g2d(2) 1 2 1 f (2) = 0 2 dqnm idqnm = 0. (11) equations generalization well-known nielsen-olesen vortex equations {$9601029$}. one verify solutions (11) preserve half supersymmetries, choose signs n m. 5 3.1 simplest case: q1 = 2, q2 = 1 consider simplest case two d4-branes d4-brane, thus two intersections. following, take lower sign (11), corresponds investigating positive-charge monopole solutions. bps equations following. f (1) 1,12 = g2(|q11|2 + ) f (1) 2,12 = g2(|q21|2 + ) f (2) 1,12 = g2(|q11|2 + |q21|2 2) (1q11 + i(a(1) 1,1 a(2) (1q21 + i(a(1) 2,1 a(2) redene elds follows. 1,1)q11) i(2q11 + i(a(1) 1,1)q21) i(2q21 + i(a(1) 1,2 a(2) 2,2 a(2) 1,2)q11) = 0 1,2)q21) = 0 1, a(2) = a(1) 1,, f = 1a2 2a1, q = q11, 1, 2, a(2) = a(1) f = 1 a2 2 a1 q = q21 suitable rescaling, obtain f = 2|q|2 |q|2 + 3 f = |q|2 2|q|2 + 3 (1q + ia1q) i(2q + ia2q) = 0 (1 q + a1 q) i(2 q + a2 q) = 0 original gauge elds determined use condition 1,12 + f (1) f (1) 2,12 + f (2) 1,12 = 0. (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) first discuss topological properties solutions. boundary conditions innity (|q| 1, dq 0) lead magnetic charge q ei, . 1 2 z d2xf = 1 2 (( = 2) ( = 0)). (23) (24) single-valuedness q, rhs (24) integer n. similar result holds q, magnetic charge another integer n. energy solution e = 1 2 (n + n) 6 (25) shows solution stable due topological property. next consider radially symmetric solutions magnetic charge n n. suppose following ansatz. q = f (r)ein, = x q = f (r)ein, = x a(r) n r2 n r2 a(r) (26) (27) (r, ) polar coordinates. reduces (18)(21) ordinary dierential equa- tions. r r df dr f dr = n(1 a)f, = n(1 a) f , n r n r da dr da dr = 2f 2 f 2 + 3 = f 2 2 f 2 + 3 boundary conditions f, f 1, a, 1 (r ). (28) (29) (30) argue global property solutions. natural expect positive-charge monopole solutions f, f 0, f = n dr etc. means a, monotonically increasing functions. (30), see a, 1. integrating (28) use boundary value f , obtain da r log f (r) = z r 1 n(1 a()) (31) rhs always negative, indicating 0 f 1. especially, since a(0) < 1 rhs must diverge r = 0. means f (0) = 0. similar argument leads a(0) < 1, f (0) = 0. solution exist around r = 0. useful dene h(r) = n(1 a(r)) etc. solution f (r) = crn + o(rn+1) f (r) = crn + o(rn+1) h(r) = n h(r) = n 3 2 3 2 r2 + o(r2(m+1)) r2 + o(r2(m+1)), (32) (33) (34) (35) = max(n, n). c, c non-zero constants. assuming solutions exist globally, one calculate dimension moduli space mn,n monopole solutions charges (n, n). ordinary index calculation, obtain (36) dimrmn,n = 2(n + n) 7 interpreted follows. remember system considered brane conguration two intersections. therefore solutions charges (n, n) correspond conguration n d0-branes one intersection, n d0-branes another intersection. moduli correspond positions d0-branes intersection. expect arguments extended q1 3, q2 = 1 case. 3.2 q1 = q2 case consider general case: q1 = q2 = q. properties solutions similar previous case. single-valuedness qnm, magnetic charges quantized, 1 2 z d2xfnm = lnm z fnm = f (1) n,12 f (2) m,12. (37) (38) (39) (40) one easily see lnms independent. obey lnm + ln+1,m+1 = ln+1,m + ln,m+1. simplest charge distributions satisfy (39) are, q = 2, l11 l21 l12 l22 ! = 1 0 1 0 ! , 1 1 0 0 ! etc. d0-brane interpretation solutions (40) follows. consider original non-abelian theory. number d0-branes n given n = 1 2 z d2x(trf (1) 12 trf (2) 12 ), (41) 12 + trf (2) (trf (1) number d0-branes given 12 = 0 bps solutions). thus abelian theory discussed n = = = f (1) n,12 q xm=1 f (2) m,12) q q 1 1 2 z d2x( xn=1 2 z d2x xn=1 xn=1 lnn. q fnn (42) distributions (40) corresponds n = 1. general solutions obtained superpositions simple solutions, exist solution 8 n. therefore bps monopole solutions interpreted d0-branes intersections. 4. discussions constructed eective thoery d4-d4 intersections d4(d4)-branes separated other, studied properties bps monopole solutions theory. solutions allow us interpret d0- branes intersections. q1 = 2, q2 = 1 case, evidence existence monopole solutions, moduli correspond positions d0-branes intersections. general cases, argued may exist monopoles corresponding number d0-branes. contrast case previous paper {$9909091$}, derivation entropy counting ground states bps monopoles less straightforward present context. seen q1 = q2 = 2 case, unit solutions (40). hard interpret d0-brane particular intersection. means number states contribute entropy might less expected. think missing states recovered, moduli space unit solution (40) larger one obtained q1 = q2 = 1 case, solutions larger number ground states one might think. thus think description discussed paper intermediate step toward construction quantum mechanics black hole. consider non-abelian theory, quantum number labels bps states number d0-branes. solutions included moduli space cannot counted individually. possible, principle, construct quantum mechanics black hole -model whose target space moduli space bps monopole solutions. microstates contribute entropy obtained ground states, corresponds cohomology elements moduli space. moreover dynamics -model describe physics near-extremal black hole. acknowledgment would like thank h.itoyama, k.murakami, t.yokono valuable discussions. 9
