abstract

we derive an energy bound for a baryonic d5-brane probe in the ads5 
s5 background near the horizon of n d3-branes. congurations saturat-
ing the bound are shown to be 1/4 supersymmetric s5-wrapped d5-branes
with n singularities at arbitrary positions. previous results for n coin-
cident singularities are recovered as a special case. we derive a similar
energy bound for a baryonic m5-brane probe in the background of n
m5-branes. congurations saturating the bound are again 1/4 supersym-
metric and, in the ads7  s4 near-horizon limit, provide a worldvolume
realization of the baryon string vertex of the (2,0)-supersymmetric six-
dimensional conformal eld theory on coincident m5-branes. for the full
m5-background we nd a worldvolume realization of the hannany-witten
eect in m-theory.

1 introduction

many aspects of the physics of intersecting branes of m-theory or superstring theory
can be understood in terms of the worldvolume eld theory of a probe (or test)
brane in the supergravity background of other branes. one attractive feature of this
approach is that many such supergravity backgrounds have non-singular horizons near
which they are asymptotic to kaluza-klein vacua with an anti-de sitter (ads) factor
[1]; this allows one to make contact with the physics of supersymmetric conformal
eld theories (cft) via the ads/cft correspondence [2]. a nice example is provided
by a closed d5-brane surrounding n d3-branes (such that the d3-branes thread
the d5-branes). the hannany-witten (hw) eect [3] implies that each of the n
d3-branes must be connected to the d5-brane by a (fundamental) iib string. it
follows that the d5-brane cannot contract to a point but must instead contract to
some lowest energy conguration involving the d3-branes and n iib strings. in the
limit of large n this conguration can be investigated by replacing the d3-branes by
the corresponding supergravity background. as the d5-brane is allowed to contract
(quasi-statically) it enters the near-horizon region of the background for which the
geometry is ads5  s5. at this point the d5-brane is wrapped on the s5 factor and
the n strings emanating from it can be considering as having their endpoints on the
ads5 boundary. this conguration was interpreted in [4, 5] as a baryon-vertex of
n = 4 d = 4 super-yang-mills (sym) theory.
although the above description of the baryon vertex involves iib strings in ad-
dition to a d5-brane, it is also possible to view it as a single d5-brane carrying n
units of born-infeld (bi) charge [6, 7]. the simplest such congurations, which might
reasonably be called baryonic branes, are specied by giving the radial position of a
d5-brane in ads5 as a function of the 5 angular coordinates of the 5-sphere. because
of the bi charge this function must have n singularities on s5 (counting multiplicities)
which are interpreted as the n iib strings. the symmetry group of this conguration
is the subgroup of the so(6) isometry group of s5 that leaves invariant the position
of the singularities. for generic positions of the n singularities this group is trivial
but it can be as large as so(5) if we suppose that all n singularities are at a single
point on s5 (or distributed between two antipodal points). in this case, the function
on s5 describing radial deformations reduces to a function of a single angular vari-
able. the condition for such a conguration to (partially) preserve supersymmetry
was found in [6]. an explicit solution of this condition was found in [7] where it
was also pointed out that the fraction of the bulk supersymmetry preserved is 1/4.
it was subsequently shown that this solution saturates an energy bound and hence
minimises the energy for a xed value of a topological charge [8].

one purpose of this paper is to generalize the results of [6, 7, 8] by relaxing the
condition of so(5)-invariance. we rst generalize the energy bound of [8] to allow for
arbitrary positions of the n singularities of the radial function on the 5-sphere. we
then show that the conditions required for the saturation of this bound are precisely
those for preservation of 1/4 supersymmetry, thereby generalizing the supersymmetry
condition of [6]. our method makes use of the -symmetry transformations of the

1

d5-brane [9]. as for any super-brane action in any background compatible with -
symmetry, the -symmetry transformations involve a matrix , characteristic of the
background and type of brane. the number of supersymmetries preserved by the
combined background/brane system is the number of linearly-independent solutions
of

 = 

(1.1)

where  is an arbitrary linear combination of killing spinors of the background [10].
in all previous applications of this formula it has been found possible to replace 
by a constrained but constant spinor , but this turns out not to be possible for the
cases considered here.

another purpose of this paper is to generalize the results for the baryonic d5-
brane to the baryonic m5-brane. to see what this entails, we recall that the hw
eect has an m-theory analogue [3]. this eect implies that a closed m5-brane with
one direction parallel to n other m5-branes, and otherwise lying on a 4-sphere at
xed radius from them, must be connected to each of the enclosed m5-branes by an
m2-brane, with one dimension of the m2-brane in the common direction of all m5-
branes. let us replace the n m5-branes by a supergravity m5-brane and consider
the remaining one as a probe. near the horizon of the supergravity m5-brane the
geometry is that of ads7  s4 and if the probe is allowed to contract it will end up as
an m5-brane wrapped on the 4-sphere. this m5-brane is the baryon string vertex
of the (2,0) conformal eld theory on the ads7 boundary [5, 11]. it is connected to
the ads7 boundary by n m2-branes; from the ads7 perspective these n m2-branes
appear to meet in a string-like junction at some point in the ads7 interior.

here we will show that it is posible to view this conguration of m5-brane and n
m2-branes as a single m5-brane carrying n units of the charge associated with the
self-dual closed worldvolume 3-form. by analogy with the d5-brane case, we will call
this a baryonic m5-brane. a baryonic m5-brane wraps the 4-sphere of ads7  s4
with n singular points; these points are singularities of the function specifying the
radial position of each point of the m5-brane. we derive an energy bound satised
by such congurations and show that the congurations that saturate it preserve
1/4 of the bulk supersymmetry. the generic supersymmetric baryonic m5-brane has
n-singularies at arbitrary points on the 4-sphere. by taking all n singularities to
be at the same point we are able to restrict our attention to congurations invariant
under the so(4) subgroup of the so(5) isometry group of the 4-sphere. these are
specied by a radial function of a single angular coordinate. the requirement of 1/4
supersymmetry then reduces to a dierential equation for this radial function which
turns out to be the same as one recently found, and solved, for a baryonic d4-brane
in a d4-brane background [12, 13].

we shall begin with an analysis of the baryonic d5-brane in the background of
n d3-branes and then carry out a similar analysis for the baryonic m5-brane in the
background of n m5-branes. the connection with baryon vertices involves a replace-
ment of these backgrounds by their near-horizon limits but our methods are general
and apply both to the full backgrounds and their near-horizon limits. the physics

2

of the full background case is, however, rather dierent as one cannot expect to nd
a static d5-brane wrapped around n d3-branes at an arbitrary distance from them.
one instead nds partially-wrapped congurations that provide a worldvolume real-
ization of the hw eect [7]. these results have since been extended to all dp-branes
[13]. because our analysis of supersymmetry applies to the full backgrounds we are
able to establish the partial supersymmetry of these d-brane congurations.

in the m5-brane case neither the near-horizon nor the full m5-brane background
has been previously considered. our results for the near-horizon case are as summa-
rized above. in the full background we again cannot expect to nd static s4-wrapped
solutions but we can, and do, nd partially-wrapped m5-branes that still preserve
1/4 supersymmetry. these results provide us with a detailed worldvolume description
of the hw eect in m-theory.

2 baryonic d5-brane

the d3-brane solution of iib supergravity has all elds vanishing except the dilaton,
which is constant, and the 10-metric and self-dual 5-form eld strength g(5). for n
coincident d3-branes at the origin, these take the form

ds2

(10) = u 1/2 ds2(e(1,3)) + u 1/2hdr2 + r2d2
5i
g(5) = 4r4h(5) + 5i

(2.1)

(2.2)

where d2
and 5 its hodge dual. the function u is

5 is the so(6)-invariant metric on the unit 5-sphere, 5 is its volume 5-form

4

u = a +(cid:18)r
r (cid:19)

(cid:16)r4 = 4gsn()2(cid:17)

(2.3)

where gs is the string coupling constant and  the inverse iib string tension. we set
a = 1 for the full d3-brane solution and a = 0 for its near-horizon limit.

we now put a probe d5-brane of unit tension into this background such that
it wraps the 5-sphere. let  = (t, i) be the worldvolume coordinates, so that i
(i = 1, . . . , 5) are coordinates for the worldspace 5-sphere. the bosonic part of the
d5-brane action is

s = zrs5

d6(cid:20)q det (h + f )  v  g(5)(cid:21)

(2.4)

where h is the induced worldvolume metric and f = dv is the born-infeld u(1) eld
strength. because of the coupling of v to the background 5-form eld strength g(5),
the d5-brane must carry bi electric charge [4]. it follows that we cannot take f to
vanish but we can assume vanishing magnetic charge, in which case f0i are the only
non-zero components of f . following [6, 7, 8], we shall now proceed as if we were
seeking a worldvolume soliton on the d5-brane, represented by a (radial) deformation

3

of the d5-brane in the direction separating it from the backgound d3-branes. such
a conguration can be represented by the array

d3 : 1 2 3
d5 :
f 1 :

4 5 6 7 8

background

soliton.

9

(2.5)

the 9-direction is the radial one.

in order to analyze this conguration we choose angular coordinates i (i =
1, . . . , 5) on the 5-sphere at radius r. we then x the worldvolume dieomorphisms
by choice of the static gauge

x 0 = t , i = i .

(2.6)

it now follows from the hamiltonian formulation of the super d-brane in a general
background [14] that the hamiltonian density for static congurations is given by

h2 = u  1

2 h ei ejgij + det gi

where g is the induced worldspace metric and ei is a covariantized electric eld
density related to f0i by

(det g) f0i = q det(h + f ) ejgij .

i ei = 4 r4qdet g

for the background/probe conguration considered here, and in the static gauge, the
gauss law constraint is

where gij is the so(6)-invariant metric on the unit 5-sphere. the source term, due
to the non-vanishing 5-form eld strength of the d3-brane background, conrms the
statement made above that the d5-brane carries a non-zero electric charge.

since we are considering only radial deformations of the d5-brane we may set

x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0 ,

(2.10)

which leaves the radial function r as the only active scalar. the worldvolume metric
for static congurations is now

2.1 energy bound

we now proceed to derive an energy bound for baryonic d5-branes. we shall do this,
following [15], by expressing h2 as a sum of squares. this can be done in more than
one way and one gets a meaningful bound on the energy only if the quantity by which
h is bounded is independent of the quantities neglected in arriving at the bound. this
will be the case if h is bounded by the integrand of a topological charge, and this
requirement serves to resolve ambiguities. the result we obtain by this method will
be conrmed in the next subsection by an analysis of supersymmetry.

we begin by rewriting the energy density (2.7) as
h2 = r2 ei ej gij + ( eiir)2 + (ur4)2r2 det g + (ur4)2 det g gijirjr ,

(2.16)

this expression is manifestly so(6) invariant but minimal energy congurations can
be at most so(5) invariant. we shall later wish to exploit this fact, so we write the
5-sphere metric as

ds2 = d2 + sin2  d2
4

(2.17)

where d2
coordinates . we may now rewrite (2.16) as

4 is the so(5) invariant metric on the 4-sphere, which we take to have

h2 = 2

5(cid:16)r2 + (r)2 + grr(cid:17) +(cid:16) er(cid:17)2
+2 er er +(cid:16) er(cid:17)2

+ r2 e eg

+(cid:16) er(cid:17)2

(2.18)

where the primes indicate derivatives with respect to . note that g are the 
components of the inverse s5 metric gij.

we can further rewrite (2.18) as

h2 = z 2

5 +h5 (r cos )  eii (r sin )i2

where ||2 indicates contraction with g, and

+ |5gr  r e|2

(2.19)

z5 = 5 (r sin ) + eii (r cos ) .
(2.20)
5 where ~z5 has components
using the gauss law (2.9), one can show that z5 = iz i
r5
5 = e r cos  +qdet g sin  a
+ r r4!
z 
5
5 = e r cos  .
z

(2.21)

from (2.19), and the fact that z5 is a divergence, we deduce the bound

with equality when

e = 5

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

gr (r sin )

e =

(r sin )  (r cos ) 

when combined with the gauss law (2.9), these conditions imply a second-order pde
for r, the solutions of which correspond to baryonic d5-branes of minimal energy.

our rst-order equations (2.23) and (2.24) have been obtained for an arbitrary
value of the coecient a. as we are mostly interested in describing the baryonic
vertex in the near-horizon region of the background, we shall take a = 0 in the
remainder of this subsection (for an analysis of the a = 1 case see refs. [7, 13]). from
the bound (2.22) we deduce the bounds

h  z d5|z5|  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z d5z5(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(2.25)

on the total energy h. the integration region is the 5-sphere with some number of
singular points removed. the rst inequality is saturated under the conditions just
obtained. the second inequality will be saturated too if z5 does not change sign
within the integration region; for the moment we shall pass over this point, but if
the second inequality is saturated then the total energy equals the 4-form dual of ~z5
integrated over the 4-boundary of the d5-brane. in other words

h = lim

0xk zbk

d~s  ~z

(2.26)

where bk is a 4-ball of radius  with the kth singular point as its centre. the kth
term in the sum can be viewed as the energy of the iib string(s) attached to the kth
singular point.

to make contact with previous work we now specialize to so(5) invariant cong-

urations. in this case e = 0 and

e = qdet g(4) e()

(2.27)

where e is a function only of . similarly, r is now a function only of . it will also
be convenient to set

(2.28)
since  = r4 sin4  is also a function only of . for such so(5)-invariant congura-
tions the rst bps condition (2.23) is trivially satised while (2.24) reduces to

5 = qdet g(4) 

r
r

=

 sin  + e cos 
 cos   e sin 

.

6

(2.29)

this equation coincides with the bps equation found previously for so(5)-invariant
congurations [6, 7, 8]. for these congurations the gauss law (2.9) becomes the
ordinary rst order dierential equation

the solution of which is given by [7]

e = 4 r4 sin4  ,

e =

1
2

r4h 3 (  ) + 3 sin  cos  + 2 sin3  cos  i

(2.30)

(2.31)

where  is an integration constant. as pointed out in [7], the symmetry of the problem
allows us to restrict  to lie in the interval [0, 1].

we now return to consider whether the second inequality of (2.25) is saturated
when the rst one is. we shall restrict our discussion of this point to the so(5)-
invariant case, for which we can write

z5 = qdet g(4) z() .

(2.32)

where z is a function only of . using (2.29) we see that

z = r

( cos   e sin )2 + ( sin  + e cos )2

( cos   e sin )

,

(2.33)

the sign of which is determined by the sign of the denominator. it follows that z
will not change sign as long as it has no singularities within the integration region
  [0, ] (except, possibly, at the endpoints  = 0, ). now
r4 sin  ()

(2.34)

 cos   e sin  =

3
2

where

()      sin  cos  .

(2.35)
we see from (2.34) that the denominator of the expression (2.33) for z vanishes
at the endpoints  = 0,  but is otherwise positive provided that () is positive. for
  [0, 1] this condition is satised only for  = 0. in this case (2.31) becomes

e =

1
2

r4h3 (sin  cos   ) + 2 sin3  cos  i

(2.36)

using this result for e() in (2.29) we nd a rst order equation for r() for which
the solution is [7]

1
3

r = r0(cid:18)6
5(cid:19)

(cosec )(  sin  cos )

1
3

(2.37)

where r0 is the value of r at  = 0.
it was shown in [7] that this conguration
corresponds to n fundamental strings attached to the d5-brane at the point  = ,

7

where r() diverges. one may verify that this is a solution of the second order
equation

" sin4 

r sin  + r cos #
r cos   r sin 

= 4 sin4  ,

(2.38)

found by combining (2.30) with (2.29).

the solutions of the rst-order equation (2.29) for  6= 0 have been obtained in
[7]. in these solutions the range of values of  for which the solution makes sense
does not coincide with the interval [0, ] and, therefore, the d5-brane does not wrap
completely the 5-sphere and does not capture completely the ve-form ux. this is
consistent with the fact that these solutions have spikes whose tensions correspond
to a number of strings less than n. actually, for non-vanishing  the d5 reaches the
point r = 0 and thus the solutions of the bps equation in this case have tubular
spikes which run away from r = 0 while part of the d5-brane reaches the horizon.
it is interesting to point out that, in order to study baryonic multiquark states with
k < n quarks in n =4 d=4 super yang-mills theory, the authors of [16] considered
congurations in which there are k strings emanating from the d5-brane that end on
r =  while the remaining n  k strings reach r = 0. it is tempting to think that
these congurations could be related to the  6= 0 solutions of the bps equation.

2.2 supersymmetry

we will now show that congurations saturating the bound (2.22) preserve 1/4 of
the bulk supersymmetry. our starting point is the equation (1.1). the matrix 
is given in [9] as a (nite) expansion in powers of the bi eld strength. because we
assume a purely electric eld strength, this expansion terminates at linear order and
the resulting matrix is

 =

1
6!

1

q det(h + f )

1...6 [1...61 + 15 f123...6(i2)] ,

(2.39)

where f0i are the only non-vanishing components of the born-infeld 2-form. the
matrices  are antisymmetrized products of the (reducible) induced worldvolume
gamma matrices

 = x mem

mm

(2.40)

where m are the constant d=10 dirac matrices and em
in the static gauge and for static congurations with x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0 we have

m is the spacetime vielbein.

0 = u  1/40
i = u 1/4 ri + u 1/4 irr .

here we have introduced the matrix

i = ei

ii

8

(2.41)

(2.42)

where ei

i is the s5 funfbein. thus

the killing spinors of the d3-brane background take the form

{i, j} = 2gij .

 = u  1
8 

(2.43)

(2.44)

where  is a covariantly constant spinor on e(1,3)  e6 subject to a 1/2 supersym-
metry breaking condition imposed by the background, which we discuss below. the
supersymmetry preservation condition (1.1) is thus reduced to

 =  .

(2.45)

although  is constant in cartesian coordinates on e(1,3)  e6, it is not constant in the
polar coordinates for e6 that we are using here. in polar coordinates a covariantly
constant spinor is independent of the radial variable and hence covariantly constant
on s5. covariantly constant spinors on sn were constructed explicitly in [17] for
a parameterisation in which the (diagonal) metric is found by iteration of ds2
n =
d2
n1. the result can expressed in terms of the n angles i = (, ) and
the antisymmetrixed products of pairs of the constant d=10 dirac matrices matrices
i = (, ). for n = 5 we have, with the understanding that 5  ,

n + sin2 nds2

where 0 is a constant spinor subject to

0123( i 2)0 = 0 ,

(2.46)

(2.47)

which is the 1/2 supersymmetry breaking condition associated with the d3-brane
background. there are additional killing spinors in the near-horizon limit but the
corresponding background supersymmetries are not preserved by the baryonic d5-
brane probe and can therefore be ignored.

using the expression (2.39) for  we nd, after some simplication, that the

supersymmetry preservation condition (2.45) reduces to

u qdet [r2gij + irjr  f0if0j]  =
[ur5det g 01  ur3det g f0jirijr(i2)
+ ur4det g i(cid:16)f0i(i2) + ir0r1(cid:17) ] 

where i = gijj and

we shall seek solutions of this equation for 0 satisfying the constraints

 = 45678 .

010 = 0 ,

(2.48)

(2.49)

(2.50)

which is expected from the local preservation of 1/2 supersymmetry by the d5-brane,
and

0r 30 = 0 ,

(2.51)

which is the condition associated with a iib string in the radial direction. these
relations imply

0r 3  = h cos   sin  ri 
0  1  = h cos   sin  ri 

other useful conditions that also follow are:

i  (i2)  =  ri 
i  0r 1  = ri er 
 r (i2)  =  

(2.52)

(2.53)

using the relations (2.52), (2.53), one can rewrite the right hand side of (2.48) as

5(cid:20) (r sin ) + r ((r cos )  f0) + r (r cos   f0)
r (rf0  rf0 + rr sin )(cid:21) .

r (rf0  rf0) + 

+ 1

1

requiring the coecients of r and r in (2.54) to vanish, we obtain

f0i = i (r cos )

(2.54)

(2.55)

which can be interpreted as the bps equation for a worldvolume bion. it is straight-
forward to check that when (2.55) is satised the coecients of  and  vanish
identically, so (2.48) is satised as a consequence of (2.55) provided that

u qdet [r2gij + irjr  f0if0j] = 5(r sin ) .

(2.56)

it can be veried that this is identically satised when f0i is given by (2.55). we
have thus shown that (2.55) is sucient for preservation of 1/4 supersymmetry. we
believe that it is also necessary; certainly, it is not dicult to check that there is no
conguration preserving more than 1/4 supersymmetry.

we have now found the condition on r and f0i required for preservation of super-

symmetry. inserting (2.56) into (2.13) and contracting with gikkr we get

eiir =

5

(r sin ) gijirj(r cos )

(2.57)

which, when inserted back into (2.13), allows us to nd the following relation between
r and ei:

one can check that (2.58) is equivalent to the two bps equations (2.23) and (2.24).
we conclude that congurations satisfying the latter two equations, which include
the so(5) invariant congurations found previously, preserve 1/4 supersymmetry.

3 baryonic m5-brane

we start from the m5-brane solution of d=11 supergravity. the metric and 4-form
eld strength f(4) = dc (3) are

(3.3)

we will put a probe m5-brane in this background and look for solutions for which
the m5-brane wraps around the s4 factor. we shall start from the lorentz covariant
m5-brane action [18]; a useful review is [19] to which we refer for details of this
formalism and references to related work. we use the conventions of [20], with minor
modications. the action is constructed from the induced worldvolume metric h and
a 2-form worldvolume potential a with modied 3-form eld strength

h = da  c (3) .

(3.4)

here, c (3) should be understood as the pullback of the 3-form potential of the back-
ground; we will use the same symbol for a spacetime form and its pullback since it
will be clear which is meant from the context. thus, the bianchi identity for h can
be written as

dh = f(4) .

(3.5)

there is an additional eld in the lorentz covariant action, the pst scalar, but it
can be removed by a gauge transformation at the cost of breaking manifest lorentz
covariance.

let  = (t, i) be the m5-brane worldvolume coordinates, and dene the worldspace

tensor

where g is the induced worldspace metric. let

h = hihj h ij

(3.7)

this is not a worldvolume tensor but it is derived from a tensor by choice of the
temporal gauge for the pst eld. in the same gauge, and for unit m5-brane tension,
the m5-brane action is

s = z d6 (cid:26)q det(h + h) + v p hp 0(cid:27) +

and c (6) is the (pullback of) the 6-form potential dual to c (3) (dened in backgrounds
that satisfy the d=11 supergravity eld equations).

notice that in the given background, the bianchi identity (3.5) becomes

dh = 3 r34 .

(3.10)

as in the d5-brane case we shall nd that this will require innite radial deformations
carrying m2-brane charge, analogous to the self-dual string solitons on the m5-brane
[21]. pursuing this analogy, we may think of the entire conguration as one involving
three branes, background, probe, and soliton, intersecting according to the array

(3.11)

the symbol  is read as ten. the tenth direction is the radial direction.

the probe m5-brane has bosonic worldvolume elds x 0, x a (a = 1, 2, 3, 4), x 5, r
and i where i (i = 1, . . . , 4) are now four angles parametrising s4, and a three-form
eld strength h. let i = (, i) be the worldspace coordinates with i parameter-
ising the 4-sphere. we shall choose the static gauge

x 0 = t

x 5 =  ,

i = i

(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) ,

(3.12)

appropriate to an m5-brane wrapped on a 4-sphere at a (variable) radius in the
5-space transverse to the background m5-brane. we also set

x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = x 4 = 0 .

(3.13)

in other words, we assume that r is the only active scalar. we also assume that
5r = 0, so that r is a function on the 4-sphere, with isolated singularities. for static
congurations we now have

h =

(3.15)

the metric g is now the so(4)-invariant metric on the unit 3-sphere.

for the background we are considering, c (3)

5ij vanishes, so we may assume that

h5ij = 0 .

(3.16)

this means that the worldspace vector density v i vanishes and that the only non-
vanishing components of h ij are

3.1 energy bound

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

we shall now derive an energy bound for baryonic m5-branes. it follows from the
hamiltonian formulation of the super m5-brane in a general background [20], that
the energy density h of a static conguration, in the background we consider and
subject to the restrictions discussed above, is such that

h2 = u  2

3 hdet g + ijgiji

(3.21)

where gij is given by (3.15). this expression is invariant under the so(5) isometry
group of the 4-sphere, but minimum energy congurations can be at most so(4)
invariant. we shall later wish to exploit this possibility so we write the 4-sphere
metric as

(3.22)
3 is the so(4)-invariant metric on the unit 3-sphere. let  ( = 1, 2, 3)

where d2
parametrize the 3-sphere, so that i = (, ). we may now rewrite (3.21) as

and ||2 indicates contraction with the  components of the four sphere metric gij, and
g are the  components of the inverse 4-sphere metric gij.

because h is, by assumption, independent of the worldspace coordinate  we may
interpret its integral over the remaining worldspace coordinates, parameterising s4,
as the tension t of a string with string coordinate . it then follows from the bound
(3.28) that

t  z d4|z4|  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z d4z4(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(3.31)

the rst inequality is saturated by solutions of (3.32). the second inequality will be
saturated too provided that z4 does not change sign in the integration region. if this
is the case then the tension t can be expressed as a surface integral over a sum of n
3-spheres surrounding the n singular points on the 4-sphere. each such surface term
can be considered to be the energy/charge of an m2-brane attached to the 4-sphere
at that point.

by combining the bps conditions (3.29) and (3.30) with the bianchi identity
(3.19) we deduce that the energy density is minimised when the radial function r is
a solution of the second order equation

in the remainder of this subsection we shall restrict ourselves to the near-horizon
a = 0 geometry. to simplify the task of nding explicit solutions of equations (3.29)
and (3.30) in this case, we will restrict our attention to an so(4)-invariant ansatz for
which the radial function depends only on . in this case only the  component of
i is non-zero, and

where () is a function only of , and g(3) is the so(4)-invariant metric on the unit
3-sphere. the bianchi identity (3.10) now reduces to

 = qdet g(3) ()

this has the solution

 = 3 r3 sin3  .

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

(3.36)

() =  r3 hcos (cid:16)sin2  + 2(cid:17) + 2(2  1)i .

where  is an integration constant which, as in the d5-brane case, can be restricted
to lie in the interval [0, 1].

it will be convenient to set

4 = qdet g(3) ()

since  = r3 sin3  is a function only of . for so(4)-invariant m5-brane congura-
tions the rst bps equation (3.29) is trivially satised while (3.30) reduces to

r
r

=

 sin    cos 
 cos  +  sin 

.

we may also set

z4 = qdet g(3) z

where z is now a function only of . using (3.37) we nd that
( sin    cos )2 + ( cos  +  sin )2

( cos  +  sin )

z = r

(3.37)

(3.38)

.

(3.39)

thus z has a denite sign provided that the denominator does not vanish. as

 cos  +  sin  = 2r3 sin  [1 + cos   2] ,

(3.40)

the denominator of (3.39) has a denite sign for   [0, ] if  = 0. in this case the
solution of the rst-order dierential equation (3.37) can be easily shown to be:

r = r0sec


2

(3.41)

where r0 is rthe value of r() at  = 0. this solution was previously found in [12]
in the context of a d4-brane probe in the d4-brane background geometry.
it is

15

straightforward to verify that the function given in (3.41) solves the second-order
ode obtained from (3.32) by setting a = 0 and restricting r to depend only on ,
namely:

" sin3 

r sin  + r cos #
r cos   r sin 

= 3 sin3  .

(3.42)

the function (3.41) represents a m5-brane wrapped on the s4 with a spike at the
point  = , where r() diverges. this spike resembles a tube extended along the
axis  = . from our previous results it is a simple exercise to compute the value of
the tension t for the conguration represented by (3.41). indeed, if we recall that
z4 is a total derivative, the integral of h over the four-sphere can be immediately
evaluated. the energy per unit surface of the spike obtained from this calculation is:

where v(3) = 22 is the volume of the unit three sphere, tm 5 is the tension of the
m5-brane which, up to now, was considered to be one and which is given by:

tm 5 v(3) |  (  )| ,

(3.43)

tm 5 =

1

(2)5 l6
p

,

(3.44)

and  (  ) can be extracted from (3.35) when  = 0. an elementary calculation
shows that:

where

tm 5 v(3) |  (  )| = n tm 2 ,

tm 2 =

1

(2)2 l3
p

(3.45)

(3.46)

is the tension of the m2-brane. this clearly shows that the tube at  =  can be
interpreted as a bundle of n m2-branes emanating from the m5-brane. the relation
of our conguration of m5-branes and m2-branes with a conguration of d4-branes
and iia fundamental strings is easily understood if we reduce the array (3.11) along
the 5-direction.

as in the d5-brane case, we could have considered congurations with  6= 0.
the corresponding solutions of the bps equation can be extracted from those found
in [12] for the d4-brane in the near-horizon region of the d4-brane geometry. these
congurations of the m5-brane do not wrap completely the s4 and, actually, they
reach the horizon r = 0, in complete analogy with what happens in the d5-brane
case. similarly, one can evaluate the energy per unit surface of the spikes of the  6= 0
solutions and show that their energy per unit surface corresponds to a bundle on k
m2-branes with k < n.

3.2 full m5 background

we are now going to study the embedding of the probe m5-brane in the full m5-brane
metric, which corresponds to taking a = 1 in the harmonic function u of equation

16

(3.3). as in the near-horizon case, we shall restrict ourselves to the analysis of the
so(4)-invariant embeddings. actually, as was shown in [7], it is more convenient to
work in a new set of variables (z, ), related to (r, ) as follows:

z = r cos  ,

 = r sin  .

(3.47)

it is clear from (3.47) that z can take values in the interval (, +) whereas
0   < . in these new coordinates the m5-brane embedding is determined by a
function z(). by using the relation between the (z, ) and (r, ) coordinates, it is
not dicult to relate z() and its derivative to r() and r() = dr/d. after a short
calculation one gets:

dz
d

=

r sin   cos  r 
r cos  + sin  r  .

(3.48)

by using (3.48) one can convert the bps condition (3.30) into a rst-order dierential
equation for z(). let us dene with this purpose the function (, z) as follows:

(, z) = 3 (cid:16) 1 +

r3

[ 2 + z2]

3

2 (cid:17)

it is easy to show that (3.30) is equivalent to:

dz
d

=

(cid:16) arctan (/z)(cid:17)

(, z)

(3.49)

(3.50)

where  is the same function as in equation (3.35) and its argument in (3.50) is
obtained after inverting the relation (3.47) between both coordinate systems.

the condition (3.50) can also be obtained by studying the energy of the m5-brane
in the new variables. let us dene, as in equation (3.31), the tension t as the energy
density integrated over the four worldspace coordinates i (i = 1,   , 4). it is not
dicult to change variables in this integral and express the result as the following
integral over :

t = v(3) z ds( 

dz
d

+  )2 + ( 

dz
d   )2

(3.51)

in this equation, and in what follows,  depends on  and z() as in (3.50). the
right-hand side of equation (3.51) contains a remarkably simple sum of squares. this
simplicity is a reection of how convenient are the new coordinates (z, ) for this
a = 1 case, a fact that shall be conrmed below. notice that the second term in
(3.51) vanishes precisely when the bps condition (3.50) holds. clearly, if we dene:

we obtain the following bounds:

x  

dz
d

+ 

t  v(3) z d| x |  v(3)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z d x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

17

(3.52)

(3.53)

obviously, the rst bound in (3.53) is saturated when the bps condition (3.50) holds.
we will show below that the second inequality is also saturated if equation (3.50) is
satised. moreover, it is easy to prove that x is a total derivative with respect to ,
namely:

x =

d

d h z + (cid:16) 1

4

+

r3

[ 2 + z2] 3

2 (cid:17) 4i .

(3.54)

it is important to stress the fact that equation (3.54) follows from the explicit form
of  given in (3.35) and, thus, is valid for any function z(). actually, the derivative
of  with respect to  for an arbitrary function z() is given by:

d
d

=

3r33
[ 2 + z2]

5
2

( 

dz
d  z ) .

(3.55)

using (3.55) to evaluate the right-hand side of (3.54), one easily veries that the
result is the function dened in equation (3.52). moreover, the value of x when the
bps condition is satised is given by:

xbp s = h dz

d

+ (cid:16)dz

d(cid:17)1i  .

(3.56)

as   0, the sign of dz/d for any z() satisfying (3.50) is the same as the sign of
. therefore, it follows that
(3.57)

xbp s  0

which implies, as was previously claimed, that the second inequality in (3.53) is
saturated if the rst one is saturated too.

the bps equation (3.50) is the same that appears in the study of a d4-brane
it

its analytical solution was found in [13].

probe in the full d4-brane geometry.
turns out that z() can be represented implicitly by the equation

z = z +

r3

2 h

z

2 + z2

+ 1  2 i

(3.58)

where z is a constant of integration.
it can be veried that the function z()
represented in (3.58) satises the second-order dierential equation (3.32), required
to minimise the energy.

the analytical solution (3.58) has been analyzed in detail in [13]. it was found in
[13] that, for regions close to the horizon, the embedding represented by the function
z() coincides with the solutions found for a = 0. however, for the asymptotic region
  , the behaviour of both types of solutions is completely dierent.
indeed,
it follows from (3.49) and (3.50) that for    and z xed (which corresponds
to   /2), dz/d decreases as 3, which implies that z constant as   ,
i.e. the asymptotic shape of the brane is just a plane. this constant asymptotic
value of z is precisely the integration constant z, as can be veried directly from
(3.58). notice that this is very natural from the physical point of view since our

18

metric is asymptotically at and one expects the minimal energy conguration of a
tense object in a at metric to be such that the object is not bent at all.

under certain conditions our solution (3.58) contains a tubular region which
has one of its ends near the horizon and can locally be described by the equation
 =constant. since |dz/d| is then large, these portions of the brane are not located
in the asymptotic region    in which, as we argued above, dz/d  0. these
tubes therefore spread out and approach the plane z = z as one moves away from
the near-horizon region. detailed study [13] shows that for large |z| the transition
between these two regimes is very fast. notice that these spikes, which have innite
length in the near-horizon approximation, have actually a nite length (of the order
of |z|) in the full geometry. in this sense one can say that the full metric regularizes
the singularities of the near-horizon description. moreover, it can be veried that
the energy of the tubes per unit surface equals that expected for a bundle of m2-
branes. from this analysis we get a picture of the hw eect in m-theory in which
m5-branes are connected by m2-branes which, from the worldvolume point of view,
can be regarded as wormholes connecting the test m5 brane to the horizon of the
metric created by the background m5-branes.

3.3 supersymmetry

we will now show that congurations saturating the bound (3.28) preserve 1/4 of the
bulk supersymmetry. our starting point is again (1.1). the explicit form of  for
the m5-brane can be found in [19]. omitting some terms which are manifestly zero
for the congurations we consider, and passing to the temporal gauge for the pst
scalar, we have

q det(h + h)  =

1
2

 det h 0 ij h ij 

1
5!

u 1/60i1...i5i1...i5 .

(3.59)

again ij  are antisymmetrized products of the (reducible) worldvolume gamma
matrices i = ix mem
mm, where m are the constant d=11 dirac matrices and
m is the spacetime elfbein. in the static gauge and for static congurations with
em
x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = x 4 = 0 we have

0 = u  1/30
i = u 1/3 ri + u 1/3ir .

in this expression we have introduced the matrix

where ei

i is the s4 vierbein. thus

i = ei

ii

{i, j} = 2gij .

for the m5-brane background, the killing spinors take the form

 = u  1

12 

19

(3.60)

(3.61)

(3.62)

(3.63)

where  is covariantly constant on e(1,5) e5 subject to a 1/2 supersymmetry breaking
condition imposed by the background, which we discuss below. the condition for
preservation of supersymmetry (1.1) is thus reduced to

in polar coordinates for e5, with 4  , we have

 =  .

 = e

y=1

e 

2 +1 0

,

where 0 is a constant spinor satisfying

67890 = 0 .

(3.64)

(3.65)

(3.66)

there are again additional killing spinors in the near-horizon limit (a = 0) but these
play no role in our analysis for the same reason as in the d5-brane case.
the supersymmetry condition (3.64) gives

u 1/3qdet (gij + kikj) = h40  iir05
i(cid:16)ir05 + u r3 det g gijjr0(cid:17)i 

ki =

det g

gijj

 = 56789 .

where

and

to solve this equation we will impose the conditions

00 = 0 ,

050 = 0 .

(3.67)

(3.68)

(3.69)

(3.70)

which are the conditions expected for an m5-brane with an m2-brane ending on it.
one can then deduce the following identities :

0 = (cos    sin )
05 = (cos    sin ) .

(3.71)
(3.72)

the matrix multiplying  on the right hand side of (3.67) can be written as

4 (r sin )  ii (r cos ) + h4 (r cos ) + ii (r sin )i
+(cid:16)4gr cos  + r cos (cid:17) + (cid:16)4gr sin  + r sin (cid:17)

requiring the coecient of  to vanish, we nd that

 = 4

gr

r

20

(3.73)

(3.74)

requiring the coecient of  to vanish and using (3.74) we then nd that

(r sin ) = 4"(r cos ) 

grr sin 

r

#

(3.75)

notice that (3.74) and (3.75) are entirely equivalent to the equations saturating the
energy bound (3.29) and (3.30). it is straightforward to check that when (3.74) is sat-
ised, the coecient of  vanishes identically, so (3.73) is satised as a consequence
of (3.74) and (3.75) provided that

u 1/3qdet (gij + kikj) =

4 r2

(r sin )  1 +

gijirjr

r2

! .

since

one can use (3.68) to rewrite the left hand side of (3.76) as

det (gij + kikj) = (det g)(cid:16)1 + gijkikj(cid:17)

u 1/3 det g + u 1/3(cid:20)r2ij gij +(cid:16)iir(cid:17)2(cid:21)

(3.76)

(3.77)

(3.78)

which can be veried to satisfy (3.76) when (3.74) and (3.75) are satised. we have
thus shown that equations (3.74) and (3.75) are sucient for preservation of 1/4
supersymmetry.
