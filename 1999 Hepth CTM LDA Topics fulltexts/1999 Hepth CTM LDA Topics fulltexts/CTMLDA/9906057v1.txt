abstract

we examine a class of gauge theories obtained by projecting out certain
elds from an n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory. these theories
are non-supersymmetric and in the large n limit are conformal. recently
it was proposed that the hierarchy problem could be solved by embedding
the standard model in a theory of this kind with nite n. in order to check
this claim one must nd the conformal points of the theory. to do this we
calculate the one-loop  functions for the yukawa and quartic scalar cou-
plings. we nd that with the  functions set to zero the one-loop quadratic
divergences are not canceled at sub-leading order in n; thus the hierarchy
is not stabilized unless n is of the order 1028 or larger. we also nd that
at sub-leading orders in n renormalization induces new interactions, which
were not present in the original lagrangian.

1 introduction

the study of conformal symmetry has a long history in particle physics. re-
cently it has attracted renewed interest due to the work of maldacena [1] on
the correspondence between string theory on anti-de sitter backgrounds and
four dimensional conformal eld theories, and further work on the orbifold
projections of these theories [2-11]. an interesting result of this work [2-5] is
that non-supersymmetric gauge theories obtained by orbifolding an n = 4
susy su(n) gauge theory are conformal in the large n limit. although
conformal theories are seemingly quite esoteric, the idea of using static or
slowly running couplings to generate a large hierarchy of scales has cropped
up many times in particle phenomenology. attempts to use approximate
conformal symmetry in phenomenology have included such diverse topics as:
electroweak symmetry breaking (walking technicolor) [12, 13, 14], the hunt
for light composite scalars [13, 15, 16] (including the search for a goldstone
boson of spontaneously broken scale invariance [15]), dynamical supersym-
metry breaking [18], and the cosmological constant problem [19]. most re-
cently frampton and vafa [10, 11] have conjectured that orbifold theories are
conformal at nite n, and further proposed that embedding the standard
model in an orbifold theory can solve the naturalness problem of the elec-
troweak scale (stabilizing the large hierarchy of scales without ne-tuning).
this sudden appearance of such a simple solution to a long standing problem
is quite surprising, so it seems worthwhile to discuss the underlying ideas of
this scenario in some detail.

it has been previously noted [20] that conformal symmetry can remove
the quadratic divergences that are responsible for destabilizing the hierarchy
between the weak scale and a more fundamental scale like the planck scale.
in a conformal theory we must insist on regulators (like dimensional regu-
larization) that respect conformal invariance or include counterterms that
maintain the symmetry. with such a regularization quadratic divergences
are impossible (since there is no cuto scale on which they could depend).
such a resolution of the naturalness problem is of course only valid if the the-
ory is exactly conformal (i.e. physics is the same at any length scale). in the
real world we know that physics is not conformal below the weak scale, and
we expect that the fundamental theory of gravity will not be scale invariant

the relation between scale invariance and conformal invariance is discussed in ref. [17].

1

since gravity has an intrinsic scale associated with it. thus the best we can
hope for phenomenologically is a theory that is approximately scale invariant
in some energy range. that is we can only have an eective conformal theory
that is valid above some infrared cuto (which must be above the weak scale)
and below some ultraviolet (uv) cuto m (which must be at or below the
planck scale). from the perspective of the fundamental theory there is some
non-conformal physics above (or near) the scale m (e.g. heavy particles or
massive string modes) which we can integrate out of the theory. studying the
sensitivity of the eective theory to the cuto m is equivalent to studying
sensitivity of the low-energy physics to the details of the very high-energy
physics. if we believe that there is a new fundamental scale of physics be-
yond the weak scale then in a natural theory we would like to see that the
weak scale is not quadratically sensitive to changes in the high scale. the
two known solutions to the naturalness problem are to either lower the uv
cuto of the eective theory to the weak scale (e.g. technicolor, large extra
dimensions) or to arrange cancelations of the quadratic divergences order-by-
order in perturbation theory (e.g. supersymmetry). one might expect that
an eective conformal theory would fall into the latter category, however
the vanishing of  functions does not imply the cancellation of quadratic
divergences, they are independent [20]. to see that they are independent
one need only consider supersymmetric theories where quadratic divergences
cancel independently of the values of  functions.

in this paper we consider a class of n = 4 orbifold theories [10, 11] at
one loop. we explicitly calculate the  functions, solve for the couplings
by imposing that the  functions vanish, and calculate the quadratic diver-
gences. we nd that the quadratic divergences do not cancel for nite n.
we also discuss new interactions that are induced by renormalization group
(rg) running, and remark on some open questions.

2 the orbifold theories

in this section we review the construction of n = 4 orbifold theories, and
present the matter content and lagrangian for the particular models that we
will be considering in this paper.

one starts with an n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory. the eld
content of this theory is (all elds are in the adjoint representation): gauge

2

bosons a, which are singlets of the su(4)r global symmetry, four copies
of (two-component) weyl fermions i, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, which transform as the
fundamental 4 under the su(4)r, and six copies of (real) scalars ij which
transform as the antisymmetric tensor 6 of su(4)r.
in the procedure of
orbifolding (discussed in detail in refs. [2-10]) one chooses a discrete subgroup
 of the su(4)r symmetry of order ||, and also embeds this subgroup into
the gauge group (chosen here to be su(n||)) as n copies of its regular
representation (for a very clear explanation of this embedding see ref. [8]).
orbifolding then means projecting out all elds from the theory which are not
invariant under the action of the discrete group . if  is a generic subgroup
of su(4)r, then one obtains a non-supersymmetric theory. if  is embedded
in an su(3) subgroup of su(4)r then one obtains an n = 1 supersymmetric
theory, while if  is embedded in an su(2) subgroup of su(4)r one obtains
an n = 2 supersymmetric theory. for a compilation of results on discrete
subgroups of su(3) and su(4) see refs. [21] and [22]. we are interested only
in the non-supersymmetric theories, in which case  must be a subgroup of
su(4). in order to simplify the analysis of the  functions, we restrict our
attention in this paper to the case when  is abelian,  = zk. in this case
we start with an su(nk) gauge group, and after orbifolding we obtain an
su(n)k theory.

2i

let us denote the k-th root of unity e

k by . an embedding of zk
into su(4)r is specied by the transformation properties of the fundamental
representation: 4  diag (k1, k2, k3, k4) 4. this embedding is an su(4)
subgroup if k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = 0 mod k (in order to insure that the de-
terminant is one), moreover k1, k2, k3, k4 6= 0 mod k so that we obtain a
non-supersymmetric theory. in order to simplify our calculations, we will as-
sume in this paper that no two kis are equal, and also that ki +kj 6= 0 mod k.
with the assumption that ki + kj 6= 0 mod k one can avoid the presence of
adjoint scalars, and thus all fermions and scalars will be in bifundamental
representations. the assumption that no two kis are equal implies that there
is only a single eld with given gauge quantum numbers. this is probably the
simplest and most symmetric orbifold theory that one can consider. how-
ever, we believe that the conclusions we draw from these particular orbifolds
could be generalized to more complicated embeddings.

with this choice of embedding of the discrete group we get the following

eld content for our orbifold theory:

3

- gauge bosons a for every gauge group su(n),
- (two-component) fermions (m, m + ki)  m

m+i which transform as
fundamentals under the m-th su(n) factor in the su(n)k product and as
antifundamental under m + ki (m is arbitrary, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and m + i is a
short hand for m + ki),

- complex scalars (m, m + li)  m

m+i which transform as fundamentals
under the m-th group and as antifundamentals under m + li (m is arbitrary,
li = ki + k4 and i = 1, 2, 3). note that for the scalars a dierent shorthand
is employed, m + i represents m + ki + k4.

the lagrangian of orbifold theories is obtained from the original la-
grangian by retaining only terms containing elds invariant under the dis-
crete symmetry. we give the n = 4 lagrangian in the appendix. the
yukawa couplings in the orbifold theory are given by
p p

m+im+i

(2.1)

ly ukawa = y xm,i<j(cid:16)m

m + h.c.(cid:17) ,

where in the above sum m + i is again a shorthand for m + ki, and p =
m + ki + kj. note that, unlike in the supersymmetric theory, there is no
factor of 2 appearing in this coupling. the quartic scalar couplings are
given by

where we have used the shorthand notation m + i = m + li = m + ki + k4
in n = 1 language, the 1, 3, and 4 couplings are
in the above sums.
descendants of the d-terms, while the 2 coupling is a descendant of the
superpotential term, and 5 receives contributions from both terms. in our
normalization 5 is twice the superpotential coupling minus the d-term cou-
pling. the lagrangian obtained by orbifolding the n = 4 theory corresponds
to degenerate values of couplings: y 2 = 1 = 2 = 3 = 4 = 5 = g2,

4

where g is the gauge coupling. however, as we will see below, for these values
of the couplings the  functions do not vanish. therefore, if the theory is
indeed conformal for nite n, one has to assume that there will be a dierent
set of couplings for which all the  functions vanish. however, for generic
values of the quartic scalar couplings the potential is unbounded from below,
while when all couplings are identical the potential is positive denite (as
guaranteed by the supersymmetry of the theory it was projected from). we
will assume that the ratios of the couplings are suciently close to one at
the zeros of the  functions so that the potential is bounded. we will see
later that this is true in the large n limit.

3 the renormalization group equations

to calculate the one-loop  functions we rely heavily on the work of machacek
and vaughn [23] who summarized one-loop results and derived two-loop 
functions for a general eld theory. we rst calculated the n = 4 susy 
functions for the gauge, yukawa and quartic couplings despite the fact that
they are related by supersymmetry. in order for this calculation to be useful
for the non-supersymmetric orbifold theories one has to refrain from using
the supereld formalism and instead deal separately with component scalar,
fermion, and gauge boson elds. there is a term by term correspondence
between the n = 4 theory and the orbifolded theory in the large n limit [5].
the fact that all the  functions vanish when susy relations are imposed
between the various couplings provides strong cross checks on the calculation.
at one-loop the gauge  function vanishes identically [10], so at one-loop
the gauge coupling is a free parameter. the general one-loop  function for
the yukawa couplings is [23]:

(4)2a

y =

1

2 (f )y a + y ay2(f )i + 2y by ay b

2 hy 
+y b tr y by a  3g2

m{c m

2 (f ), y a}

where y a

ij is the yukawa coupling of scalar a to fermions i and j,

y2(f ) = y ay a ,

(3.1)

(3.2)

and c m
2 (f ) is the quadratic casimir of the fermion elds transforming under
the m-th gauge group. thus the rst term in eq. (3.1) represents scalar

5

loop corrections to the fermion legs, the second term 1pi corrections from
the yukawa interactions themselves, the third term fermion loop corrections
to the scalar leg, and the last term represents gauge loop corrections to the
fermion legs.

the yukawa  function can be derived by projecting the n = 4 result
graph by graph (see the appendix). the only changes are that ||n is
replaced by n and the fermions are in bifundamental representations rather
than the adjoint. thus we nd:

so y vanishes when

y = y  gs1

n 2 .

(3.3)

(3.4)

note that this result is independent of the values of the quartic scalar cou-
plings.

in the notation of machacek and vaughn [23] the  function for a quartic

scalar coupling at one-loop is given by

(4)2 = 2  4h + 3a + y  3s,

(3.5)

where 2 corresponds to the 1pi contribution from the quartic interactions
themselves and should not be confused with a mass scale, h corresponds
to the fermion box graphs, a to the two gauge boson exchange graphs, y
to the yukawa leg corrections, and nally s corresponds to the gauge leg
corrections. the contributions to 2, h, and y can be found by simply
projecting the n = 4 results (see the appendix). the contributions to
s can be found by noting that the scalars are bifundamentals rather than
adjoints. the gauge boson exchange term, a, can be calculated by a simple
manipulation of the gauge generators, which is explained in the appendix.

finding the general solution for the simultaneous zeroes of the  func-

solutions for the couplings that reduce in the large n limit to the n = 4
susy xed point, i.e. i  g2. at order 1/n 4 there are two such solutions
which are given by:

we should note that the zeroes of the  functions are not true xed points.
this is because we have not included all possible quartic couplings allowed
by gauge invariance, we have only included the quartic couplings that arise
from the projection from the n = 4 theory. examples of operators that do
not appear in the tree-level lagrangian of these orbifold theories include

m
m+im+i

m m

m+im+i

and m

(3.13)

such gauge invariant operators are induced, for example, by two gauge boson
exchange diagrams. in the non-supersymmetric theory there is no symmetry
or non-renormalization theorem that prevents these operators from appearing
via rg evolution. a full calculation would require considering all possible
quartic interactions, and nding the simultaneous zeroes of all  functions.
however, if the xed point values of some of these new couplings are non-
zero then, as we will see, we loose the special large n behavior of the pure
projected theory.

we will proceed as follows: we assume that the eective conformal
theory is embedded in a more fundamental theory at a scale m (e.g. some
set of particles of mass m are integrated out of the theory at this scale), we
assume that the theory has been arranged such that the  functions for y
and i vanish, and that at this particular renormalization scale, m, all other
quartic couplings vanish. we can then compute the proper 1pi contribution
to the mass of any particular scalar. we will only keep the quadratically
divergent piece.

the quadratic divergence is given by

m2

 = "n(21  3 + 24 + 25) + 3

1
p2 .
(3.14)
plugging in our solutions for the zeroes of the  functions we have (to lowest
non-vanishing order in n) for both cases:

n 2  1

(3.15)

note that, as expected, the terms linear in n canceled. thus we see that
there is a technically unnatural hierarchy in this set of theories.
in order
to keep the scalars light a mass counterterm must be tuned, order by order,
to cancel quadratic divergences. alternatively, n has to be taken extremely
large. for m = mweak  1 tev, m = mp l  1018 gev, g2
30 we nd that
one would need n  1028.
we now briey comment on the possible eects of including other quartic
operators like those displayed in eq. (3.13). there is a contribution to 2 of
(3.5) of order n 2(new)2, the contribution to a is of order g4 (see appendix).
thus the form of the  function is:

where we have taken the coupling new
to have the same sign and normaliza-
tion as 1. in the above formula, dk is an integer, depending on how many
gauge groups the scalar elds share (see appendix). thus we expect new
to be of order g2/n at a xed point. the contribution of the graphs aris-
ing from these operators to the quadratic divergence is of order n 2, so the
contribution to m2
 is of order g2n. thus the inclusion of these additional
operators seems to make the naturalness problem much worse. it may be
possible to cancel the quadratic divergence order by order, but a priori there
seems to be no reason for such a cancellation to occur at a xed point of the
theory.

using the methods presented above one can also calculate the two-loop
gauge  function. the two-loop piece of the gauge  function in a general
gauge theory is given by [23]:

(3.17)

where c2(g) is the casimir of the adjoint, c2(f )s2(f ) is the sum over (two-
component) fermions of the casimir times the dynkin index in the given
representation, c2(s)s2(s) is the same for complex scalars, while y4(f ) is
the contribution of the yukawa couplings dened by
try ay atatb = y4(f )ab,

(3.18)

9

where y a are the yukawa coupling matrices for the scalar eld a, and ta are
the gauge generators in the representation of the fermion elds.

for the orbifold theory considered above these expressions are given by

c2(g) = n,
c2(f )s2(f ) = 4(n 2  1),
c2(g)s2(f ) = 4n 2,
c2(s)s2(s) = 3(n 2  1),
c2(g)s2(s) = 3n 2,
y4(f ) = 24n 2y 2.

(3.19)

note that eq. (3.17) is independent of the quartic scalar couplings. at the
one-loop xed point of the yukawa coupling, which is also independent of the
values of the quartic scalar couplings, y 2 = n 21
n 2 g2. using this value we nd
that the leading order terms in n cancel, and the sub-leading pieces give

(2)
g =

4g5
(4)4 > 0,

(3.20)

thus the theory is not asymptotically free. if the theory is indeed conformal,
then the xed point would necessarily be a uv xed point.
in order to
check whether the theory is conformal or not, one would need to study the
three-loop gauge  function. if the three-loop term turns out to be negative
and of o(n 2), then there will be a perturbative uv xed point, since the
xed point will be g2 = o(1/n 2) and higher loop corrections to the gauge 
function can be neglected. for any other case there cannot be a perturbative
xed point. for example if the three-loop term is o(n), then any putative
xed point can only be seen by summing all planar diagrams. such a xed
point could exist independent of the sign of the three-loop term.

if this theory turns out to be conformal with a perturbative xed point,
then this could provide an interesting example of a theory with a non-trivial
uv xed point. such a theory could then serve as a counter example to the
conjecture presented in ref. [25].

4 conclusions

in this paper we have considered a particular class of non-supersymmetric
orbifold theories obtained from nite n = 4 theories. our calculations are

10

summarized by equations (3.3), (3.6)(3.10) and (3.15). we calculated the
one-loop  functions and found the simultaneous zeroes that approach the
susy xed point in the large n limit. at one-loop the theory possesses
quadratic divergences in sub-leading orders in n and therefore cannot stabi-
lize the weak scale without n being unreasonably large.

rg running also generates new operators (quartic scalar couplings) which
are not present in the tree-level orbifold lagrangian. these new couplings
will shift the xed point values of the original operators, and also contribute
to the quadratic divergences themselves.
it is possible, but unlikely, that
with these new couplings all quadratic divergences vanish. the diculty in
canceling the quadratic divergences stems from the fact that the contributions
of the new operators to the quadratic divergence is more important in the
1/n expansion than the divergences we have discussed here. we think that
a cancellation is unlikely to occur, but the importance of the problem merits
further investigation which would involve the renormalization of the full set
of operators allowed by symmetries.

appendix a n = 4  functions
n = 4 supersymmetric theories are nite, therefore the  function vanishes
to all orders in perturbation theory. in terms of component elds the n = 4
lagrangian has three dierent kinds of couplings: gauge, yukawa, and quartic

11

scalar. even though these couplings are related by n = 4 supersymmetry
it is useful to calculate their  functions separately. in the orbifold theories
dierent couplings are not related by supersymmetry, yet n = 4 results are
helpful in the calculation of the non-supersymmetric  functions.
the n = 4 theory can be thought of as an n = 1 theory with three
adjoint chiral superelds and a superpotential for these elds. when the

where a, . . . , e = 1, . . . , n 21 are the adjoint gauge indices, while i, . . . , m =
1, 2, 3 are su(3) avor indices. the su(n) structure constant is denoted by
f abc,  is the (two-component) gaugino, i are the (two-component) adjoint
fermions, and i are the three complex adjoint scalars. meanwhile g is the
gauge coupling and y is the coupling of the superpotential term for the chiral
superelds. the above lagrangian is n = 4 supersymmetric for y = g. in
order to easily identify the origin of dierent terms in the calculation it is
instructive to keep y explicit in the lagrangian.

the one-loop (as well as two-loop)  functions are known for a general
eld theory [23]. in order to use the formulae given in ref. [23] one needs to
calculate certain group theoretic factors. this calculation can be conveniently
carried out using the method of cvitanovic [24], in which one draws a separate
group theory diagram for every feynman diagram. evaluating these group
theory diagrams will then amount to calculating the group theory coecients
needed for the general formulas of the  functions of [23]. since all elds are
in the adjoint representation every yukawa coupling carries a factor f abc while
every quartic scalar coupling carries a factor f abcf ade. in order to obtain the
group theory diagrams one replaces every factor of if abc with a cubic vertex
(see fig. 1). the diagram obtained this way does not have to coincide with
the actual form of the feynman diagram that one is evaluating.

and the quartic scalar couplings of the n = 4 theory.

using the lagrangian (a.1) and the above rules of calculating the group
theory factors one can obtain the various  functions for the n = 4 theory.
the one-loop  function for the gauge coupling is given by

s2(s)),

(a.2)

where c2(g) is the casimir of the adjoint, s2(f ) is the dynkin index of the
(two-component) fermions, and s2(s) is the dynkin index for the complex
scalars. for the n = 4 theory c2(g) = n, s2(f ) = 4n, s2(s) = 3n, and
thus g = 0.
the one-loop  function for the yukawa coupling y a in a general gauge

theory is given by the formula

(4)2a

y =

2 (f )y a + y ay2(f )) + y by ay b + y btry by a

in the case of the n = 4 theory we evaluate the  function of the vertex
2gf abcc
i. in the projected orbifold theory all yukawa couplings are
equal due to the zk symmetry of the theory, thus we can use any of the
n = 4 vertices to obtain the projected result. for this coupling the dierent
terms in the above  function are:

the sum of these terms adds up to zero independently of the value of y ,
which can be understood in the following way: for y 6= g we have an n =
1 supersymmetric theory with three adjoint fermions and a non-vanishing
superpotential. since we have chosen the  function of the yukawa coupling
involving the gaugino, therefore the yukawa  function has to be proportional
to the gauge  function for any value of y . the one-loop  function of the
gauge coupling is independent of y therefore the cancellation has to happen
for a generic value of y . this provides an independent check of our result.

finally we calculate the one loop  functions for the quartic scalar cou-

plings. the general formula for an arbitrary gauge theory is given by

(4)2quartic = 2 + 3a  4h + y  3s.

(a.5)

we calculate two dierent combinations of quartic  functions in the n =

the contributions to which are given in fig. 3. combining these results
according to eq. (a.5) one nds that these  functions indeed vanish for the
n = 4 theory. cancellation of various terms occurs after decomposing the
gluon box diagrams [24] in a complete basis of group theory tensors using
the results given in fig. 4.

in order to project the n = 4 theory down to the orbifolded theory it is
convenient to make use of large n double-line notation, since all our elds
are bifundamentals. to do this we need two su(n) identities:

if abc = 2tr (t at bt c  t ct bt a) ,

and

basis to the double index basis we need to rescale

figure 4: the diagrammatic representation of the su(n) group theory iden-

do indeed vanish. the rst line gives the decomposition of the gluon box
diagram in terms of a complete set of tensors, the second line is the jacobi
identity, while the third line is an identity relating dierent combinations of
the d and f tensors. a single unconnected line corresponds to a
b . these
results are taken from [24].

using these identities and representing i
obtain the large n results given in fig. 5.

at tree-level the eect of orbifolding is similar to taking the above large
n limit, the only dierence is that dierent oriented lines can correspond
to dierent gauge groups. the appropriate combination of gauge groups for
each vertex can be read o from the projected lagrangian (2.2). once we
have the tree-level vertices we can simply calculate all the diagrams relevant
to the  functions. additionally we can apply the projection rules to the
n = 4 diagrams involving quartic or yukawa couplings, however sub-leading
terms in n can be generated in loops, and these terms must be kept. this
procedure provides a check on the calculation.

the double line notation is also convenient for gauge diagrams, however
1/n terms are already present in the gauge boson propagator so a little more

calculation of the proper correction to the quartic coupling from two gauge
boson exchange. for simplicity, we consider the case of two dierent scalar
elds that share one gauge group. the calculation proceeds by using the
identity (a.7) and is depicted in fig. (6).
