abstract

we consider the maldacena conjecture applied to the near horizon geometry of a d1-
brane in the supergravity approximation and consider the possibility of testing the
conjecture against the boundary eld theory calculation using dlcq. we propose the
two point function of the stress energy tensor as a convenient quantity that may be
computed on both sides of the correspondence. on the supergravity side, we may invoke
the methods of gubser, klebanov, polyakov, and witten. on the eld theory side, we
derive an explicit expression for the two point function in terms of data that may be
extracted from a dlcq calculation at a given harmonic resolution. this gives rise to a
well dened numerical algorithm for computing the two point function, which we test in
the context of free fermions and the t hooft model. for the supersymmetric yang-mills
theory with 16 supercharges that arises in the maldacena conjecture, the algorithm
is perfectly well dened, although the size of the numerical computation grows too
fast to admit any detailed analysis at present, and our results are only preliminary.
we are, however, able to present more detailed results on the supersymmetric dlcq
computation of the stress energy tensor correlators for two dimensional yang mills
theories with (1,1) and (2,2) supersymmetries.

1 introduction

there has been a great deal of excitement during this past year following the realization
that certain eld theories admit concrete realizations as a string theory on a particular
background [1]. by now many examples of this type of correspondence for eld theories
in various dimensions with various eld contents have been reported in the literature (for
a comprehensive review and list of references, see [2]). however, attempts to apply these
correspondences to study the details of these theories have only met with limited success so
far. the problem stems from the fact that our understanding of both sides of the correspon-
dence is limited. on the eld theory side, most of what we know comes from perturbation
theory where we assume that the coupling is weak. on the string theory side, most of
what we know comes from the supergravity approximation where the curvature is small.
there are no known situations where both approximations are simultaneously valid. at the
present time, comparisons between the dual gauge/string theories have been restricted to
either qualitative issues or quantities constrained by symmetry. any improvement in our
understanding of eld theories beyond perturbation theory or string theories beyond the
supergravity approximation is therefore a welcome development.

in this note we raise the supersymmetric discrete light cone quantization (sdlcq) of
eld theories [3, 4, 5] to the challenge of providing quantitative data which can be compared
against the supergravity approximation on the string theory side of the correspondence. we
will work in two space-time dimensions where the sdlcq approach provides a natural non-
perturbative solution to the theory. in general, attempts to improve the eld theory side
beyond perturbation theory seem like a promising approach in two space-time dimensions
where a great deal is already known about eld theories beyond perturbation theory.

we will study the eld theory/string theory correspondence motivated by considering
the near-horizon decoupling limit of a d1-brane in type iib string theory [6]. the gauge
theory corresponding to this theory is the yang-mills theory in two dimensions with 16
supercharges.
its sdlcq formulation was recently reported in [7]. this is probably the
simplest known example of a eld theory/string theory correspondence involving a eld
theory in two dimensions with a concrete lagrangian formulation.

a convenient quantity that can be computed on both sides of the correspondence is the
correlation function of gauge invariant operators [8, 9]. we will focus on two point functions
of the stress-energy tensor. this turns out to be a very convenient quantity to compute for
many reasons that we will explain along the way. some aspects of this as it pertains to a
consideration of black hole entropy was recently discussed in [10]. there are other physical
quantities often reported in the literature. in the dlcq literature, the spectrum of hadrons

is often reported. this would be ne for theories in a conning phase. however, we expect
the sym in two dimension to ow to a non-trivial conformal xed point in the infra-red
[6, 11]. the spectrum of states will therefore form a continuum and will be cumbersome to
handle. on the string theory side, entropy density [12] and the quark anti-quark potential
[12, 13, 14] are frequently reported. the denition of entropy density requires that we
place the eld theory in a space-like box which seems incommensurate with the discretized
light cone. similarly, a static quark anti-quark conguration does not t very well inside a
discretized light-cone geometry. the correlation function of point-like operators do not suer
from these problems. we should mention that there exists interesting work on computing
the qcd string tension [15, 16] directly in the eld theory. these authors nd that the qcd
string tension vanishes in the supersymmetric theories which is consistent with the power
law quark anti-quark potential found on the supergravity side.

2 correlation functions from supergravity

let us begin by reviewing the computation of the correlation function of stress energy tensors
on the string theory side using the supergravity approximation. the computation is essen-
tially a generalization of [8, 9]. the main conclusion on the supergravity side was reported
recently in [10] but we will elaborate further on the details. the near horizon geometry of a
d1-brane in string frame takes the form

in order to compute the two point function, we need to know the action for the diagonal
uctuations around this background to the quadratic order. what we need is an analogue
of [17] for this background which unfortunately is not currently available in the literature.
fortunately, some diagonal uctuating degrees of freedom can be identied by following the
early work on black hole absorption cross-sections [18, 19]. in particular, we can show that
the uctuations parameterized according to

ds2 = (cid:16)1 + f (x0, u) + g(x0, u)(cid:17) g00(dx0)2 +(cid:16)1 + 5f (x0, u) + g(x0, u)(cid:17) g11(dx1)2

by direct substitution into the equations of motion in 10 dimensions. we have assumed
without loss of generality that these uctuation vary only along the x0 direction of the world
volume coordinates like a plane wave eikx0. the elds f (u) and g(u) are scalars when the
d1-brane is viewed as a black hole in 9 dimensions; in fact there are the minimal and the
xed scalars in this black hole geometry. in 10 dimensions, however, we see that they are
really part of the gravitational uctuation. we expect therefore that they are associated
with the stress-energy tensor in the operator eld correspondence of [8, 9]. in the case of
the correspondence between n = 4 sym and ads5  s5, superconformal invariance allowed
the identication of operators and elds in short multiplets [20]. for the d1-brane, we do
not have superconformal invariance and this technique is not applicable. in fact, we expect
all elds of the theory consistent with the symmetry of a given operator to mix. the large
distance behavior should then be dominated by the contribution with the longest range. the
eld f (k0, u) appears to be the one with the longest range since it is the lightest eld.

the equation (3) for f (u) can be solved explicitly in terms of the bessels function

f (u) = u 3k3/2(q163g2

y m n u 2k).

(4)

by thinking of f (u) in direct analogy with the minimally coupled scalar as was done in
[8, 9], we can compute the ux factor

up to a numerical coecient of order one which we have suppressed. we see that the leading

this result passes the following important consistency test. the sym in 2 dimensions with
16 supercharges have conformal xed points in both uv and ir with central charges of
order n 2 and n, respectively. therefore, we expect the two point function of stress energy
tensors to scale like n 2/x4 and n/x4 in the deep uv and ir, respectively. according to the

analysis of [6], we expect to deviate from these conformal behavior and cross over to a regime
where supergravity calculation can be trusted. the cross over occurs at x = 1/gy mn and
x = n/gy m . at these points, the n scaling of (6) and the conformal result match in the
sense of the correspondence principle [21].

3 correlation functions from dlcq

the challenge then is to attempt to reproduce the scaling relation (6), x the numerical
coecient, and determine the detail of the cross-over behavior using sdlcq. ever since
the original proposal [22], the question of equivalence between quantizing on a light-cone
and on a space-like slice have been discussed extensively. this question is especially critical
whenever a massless particle or a zero-mode in the quantization is present. it is generally
believed that the massless theories can be described on the light-cone as long as we take
m  0 as a limit. the issue of zero mode have been examined by many authors. some
recent accounts can be found in [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. generally speaking, supersymmetry
seems to save sdlcq from complicated zero-mode issues. we will not contribute much to
these discussions. instead, we will formulate the computation of the correlation function of
stress energy tensor in naive dlcq. to check that these results are sensible, we will rst do
the computation for the free fermions and the t hooft model. extension to sym with 16
supercharges will be essentially straightforward, except for one caveat. in order to actually
evaluate the correlation functions, we must resort to numerical analysis at the last stage of
the computation. for the sym with 16 supercharges, this problem grows too big too fast
to be practical on desk top computer where the current calculations were performed. we
can only provide an algorithm, which, when executed on an much more powerful computer,
should reproduce (6). nonetheless, the fact that we can dene a concrete algorithm seems to
be a progress in the right direction. one potential pit-fall is the fact that the computation
may not show any sign of convergence. if this is the case, or if it converges to a result at
odds with (6), we must go back and re-examine the issue of equivalence of forms and the
issue of zero modes.

the technique of dlcq is reviewed by many authors [5, 28] so we will be brief here. the
basic idea of light-cone quantization is to parameterize the space using light cone coordinates
x+ and x and to quantize the theory making x+ play the role of time. in the discrete light
cone approach, we require the momentum p = p+ along the x direction to take on discrete
values in units of p+/k where p+ is the conserved total momentum of the system and k is an
integer commonly referred to as the harmonic resolution. one can think of this discretization
as a consequence of compactifying the x coordinate on a circle with a period 2l = 2k/p+.

4

the advantage of discretizing the light cone is the fact that the dimension of the hilbert space
becomes nite. therefore, the hamiltonian is a nite dimensional matrix and its dynamics
can be solved explicitly. in sdlcq one makes the dlcq approximation to the supercharges
and these discrete representations satisfy the supersymmetry algebra. therefore sdlcq
enjoys the improved renormalization properties of supersymmetric theories. of course, to
recover the continuum result, we must send k to innity and as luck would have it, we nd
that sdlcq usually converges faster than the naive dlcq. of course, in the process, the
size of the matrices will grow, making the computation harder and harder.

let us now return to the problem at hand. we would like to compute a general expression

of the form

f (x, x+) = ho(x, x+)o(0, 0)i .

(7)

in dlcq, where we x the total momentum in the x direction, it is more natural to
compute its fourier transform

1
2lho(p, x+)o(p, 0)i .
this can naturally be expressed in a spectrally decomposed form

f (p, x+) =

f (p, x+) = xi

3.1 free dirac fermions

let us rst consider evaluating this expression for the stress-energy tensor in the theory of
free dirac fermions as a simple example. the lagrangian for this theory is

l = i /   m 

(10)

where for concreteness, we take 0 = 2, 1 = i1 and we take  = 21/4( 
the spinor components, the lagrangian takes the form

 ). in terms of

l = i+ + i 

im
2

(  ) .

(11)

since we treat x+ as time and since  does not have any derivatives with respect to x+ in the
lagrangian, it can be eliminated from the equation of motion, leaving a lagrangian which
depends only on :

(12)

l = i+ + i

we can therefore express the canonical momentum and energy as

p = z dx i
p+ = z dx

(13)

in dlcq, we compactify x to have period 2l. we can then expand  and  in modes

(14)

operators b(n) and d(n) with positive and negative n are interpreted as a destruction and
creation operators, respectively.
in a theory with only fermions, it is customary to take
anti-periodic boundary condition in order to avoid zero-mode issues. therefore, n will take
on half-integer values2. they satisfy the anticommutation relation

{b(n), b(m)} = {d(n), d(m)} = n,m .

(15)

now we are ready to evaluate (9) in dlcq. as a simple and convenient choice, we take

o(k) =

1

2 z dx (i  i()) e ik

l x

.

(16)

which is the fourier transform of the local expression for p with the total derivative con-
tribution adjusted to make this operator hermitian. therefore, this should be thought of as
the t ++ component of the stress energy tensor. for reasons that will become clear as we go
on, this turns out to be one of the simplest things to compute. when acted on the vacuum,
this operator creates a state

t ++(k)|0i =



l   k

2  n! b(k + n)d(n)|0i .

since the fermions in this theory are free, the plane wave states

|ni = b(k + n)d(n)|0i

(17)

(18)

constitute an eigenstate. the spectrum can easily be determined by commuting these oper-
ators:

which is simply the discretized version of the spectrum of a two body continuum. all that
we have to do now is calculate eigenstates of the actual theory we are interested in and

2in sdlcq one must use periodic boundary condition for all the elds to preserve the supersymmetry.

to assemble these pieces into (9), but we can do a little more to make the result more
presentable. the point is that since (9) is expressed in mixed momentum/position space
notation in minkowski space, the answer is inherently a complex quantity that is cumbersome
to display. for the computation of two point function, however, we can go to position space
by fourier transforming with respect to the l variable. after fourier transforming, it is
straight forward to euclideanize and display the two point function as a purely real function
without loosing any information. to see how this works, let us write (9) in the form

f (p, x+) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(20)

the quantity inside the absolute value sign is designed to be independent of l. now, to
recover the position space form of the correlation function, we inverse fourier transform
with respect to p = k/l.

the integral over l can be done explicitly and gives

l

f (x, x+) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
f (x, x+) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

has explicit dependence on the harmonic resolution parameter k, but all dependence on

t hooft model

let us now turn to a slightly more interesting problem of computing the correlation function
of t ++ in t hoofts model of two dimensional qcd [29] in the large n limit. this theory
has two characteristic scales, one determined by the mass of the quarks and the other by
the strength of the gauge coupling g2
y m n. to a large extent, this is a solvable model. the
spectrum and the wave function of the hadrons are encoded in a one parameter integral
equation that can be handled in many ways. a thorough analysis of this model including
the discussion of asymptotic behavior of certain correlation functions can be found in [30].
this is clearly a very mature subject.

applying dlcq to the t hooft model is tantamount to placing t hoofts integral equa-
tion for the meson spectrum on a lattice. the lattice is in the light-cone momentum space,
which is precisely what is expected when the light-cone is compactied on a circle. the
dlcq of the t hooft model was analyzed in detail by [31, 32].

our goal here is to show that the computation of (9) is straight forward and that it
generates sensible answers. in fact, nothing could be simpler. the t hooft model is nothing
more than a gauged version of the free fermion model. the lagrangian for this theory is
simply

l = 

f 2 + i d/   m  .

(26)

we choose the light cone gauge a+ = 0 which is customary. one then nds that the a
component of the gauge eld is non-dynamical and can be eliminated using the equation
of motion, just like the  component of the spinor in the free fermion model. expressing
everything in terms of the only dynamical eld in this theory which is , one nds the
canonical energy and momentum operators to take the form

p = z dx i

where j = . all that changed in comparison to the free fermion model is the addition of
a current exchange term in the light-cone hamiltonian. therefore, all we have to do here is
to perform the identical computation specied by (23), but using the modied hamiltonian,
and letting m 2
n and |ni be the spectrum and the wavefunction of the n-th meson state in the
spectrum. since in dlcq we are always working with a nite dimensional representation of
the hamiltonian dynamics, a small change in the form of the hamiltonian matrix causes no
particular diculty. let us discuss the result of such a computation. we will consider the
case when g2

can be computed reliably for large k and is in agreement with the results reported in [29]
(see gure 1.a). since the state (17) created by operator (16) is odd under parity n  k  n,
only parity odd states contribute in the spectral decomposition. for r  1/gy mn, we
expect the correlation function to behave just like the free fermion. the lightest meson in
the parity odd sector has a mass of order gy mn . due to the presence of this mass-gap,
for r  1/gy mn, we expect to see an exponential damping of the correlation function.

this is precisely the behavior we seem to be nding. in gure 1.b, we illustrate the result
of computing (23) by rst constructing the mass matrix m 2 symbolically, then evaluating
the spectrum and the eigenfunctions numerically and assembling the pieces. we have chosen

to set gy mqn/ = 101 and m = 101. we have tried harmonic resolutions k = 5, k = 10,

k = 50, and k = 100. remarkably, the computation at a low harmonic resolution k seems
not to be so far o from the result found using larger values of k. the correlation function
appears to have more or less converged by the time we reach k = 100. we have also included
a plot for g2

y m n = 0 with the same mass for comparison.

one of the reasons why the convergence is relatively rapid is the fact that the matrix
element h0|t ++(k)|ni in (23) is not sensitive to the structure of the t hooft wave function
at the boundaries. to see this more clearly, recall that in the continuum limit, we expect
the eigenfunctions |ni to behave as x near x = 0 where  is determined by

whose leading correction for a > 1 is dominated by the terms of order 1/n. for a less than
one, however, the leading correction is controlled by terms of order ( 1
n)a. in computing the
form factor for t ++(k), we were fortunate to have only encountered an integral whose end
point behavior went as x1+. had we instead chosen to compute two point function of a
scalar operators like  or 5, we would have considered states

which gives rise to a pole near x = 0 and x = 1 in the continuum limit. therefore, the
matrix element in the continuum limit behaves near x = 0 as x. to control the error in
this case, we must take

which grows exponentially with respect to 1. we would have had to work much harder if
we had sent m/gy mn to zero. luckily, this is not the case for with the t ++ operator.

3.3 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with 16 supercharges

finally, let us turn to the problem of computing the two point function of the t ++ operator
for the sym with 16 supercharges. just as in the t hooft model, adopting light-cone
coordinates and choosing the light-cone gauge will eliminate the gauge boson and half of
the fermion degrees of freedom. the most signicant change comes from the fact that
the elds in this theory are in the adjoint rather than the fundamental representations
and the theory is supersymmetric. this does not cause any fundamental problem in the
dlcq formulation of these theories.
indeed, the sdlcq formulation of this [7] as well
as many other related models with adjoint elds have been studied in the literature. the
main diculty comes from the fact that in supersymmetric theories low mass states such as

10

tr[b(n1)b(n2)b(k + n1 + n2)]|0i with an arbitrary number of excited quanta, or bits,
appear in the spectrum. this means that for a given harmonic resolution k, the dimension
of the hilbert space grows like exp(k), which is roughly the number of ways to partition k
into sums of integers.

the fact that the size of the problem grows very fast is somewhat discouraging from a
numerical perspective. nevertheless, it is interesting to note that dlcq provides a well
dened algorithm for computing a physical quantity like the two point function of t ++ that
can be compared with the prediction from supergravity. in the following, we will show that
this can be computed for the sym theory by a straight forward application of (23), just as
we saw in the case of the t hooft model.

the authors of [7] have shown that the momentum operator p + is given by

p + = z dxtrh(xi)2 + iuui .

(34)

the local hermitian form of this operator is given by

t ++(x) = tr(cid:20)(x i)2 +

1
2

(iuu  i(u)u)(cid:21) ,

i = 1 . . . 8,  = 1 . . . 8

(35)

where x and u are the physical adjoint scalars and fermions respectively, following the
notation of [7]. when discretized, these operators have the mode expansion

x i

i,j =

xn=1hb

ij(n)einx/l + ai

ij(n)einx/l + b

ji(n)einx/li

ji(n)einx/li .

(36)

in terms of these mode operators, we nd

t ++(k)|0i =

xn=1"qn(k  n)aij(k + n)aji(n) + k

2  n! bij(k + n)bji(n)# |0i.

(37)
therefore, (l/)h0|t ++(k)|ni is independent of l and can be substituted directly into (23)
to give an explicit expression for the two point function.

we see immediately that (37) has the correct small r behavior, for in that limit, (37)

asymptotes to (assuming nb = nf )

computing this quantity beyond the small r asymptotics, however, represents a formidable
technical challenge. the authors of [7] were able to construct the mass matrix explicitly and
compute the spectrum for k = 2, k = 3, and k = 4. even for these modest values of the
harmonic resolution, the dimension of the hilbert space was as big as 256, 1632, and 29056
respectively (the symmetries of the theory can be used to reduce the size of the calculation
somewhat). in gure 2, we display results that parallel those obtained for the t hooft model
earlier (gure 1) with the currently available values of k, except for the fact that we display
the correlation function multiplied by a factor of 42r4/n 2(2nb + nf ), so that it now asymp-
totes to 1 (or 0 in the logarithmic scale) in the k   limit. in this way any deviation from
the asymptotic behavior 1/r4 is made more transparent. note that with the values of the
harmonic resolution k obtained at present, the spectrum in gure 2.a is far from resembling
a dense continuum near m = 0. clearly, we must probe much higher values of k before we
can sensibly compare our eld theory results with the prediction from supergravity.

3.4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with less than 16 super-

charges

the computation of the correlator for the stress energy tensor in the (8,8) model is limited by
our inability to carry out the computation for large enough harmonic resolution. it is the (8,8)
model which we are ultimately interested in solving in order to compare against the prediction
of maldacenas conjecture in the supergravity limit. nevertheless, the computation of the
correlation function can just as well be applied to models with less supersymmetry. we will
conclude by reporting the results of such a computation.

12

first, let us consider the theory with supercharges (1,1). this theory is argued not to
exhibit dynamical supersymmetry breaking in [33, 34]. we can also provide a physicists
proof that supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken for this theory by adopting the argu-
ment of witten for the 2+1 dimensional sym with chern-simons interaction [35]. in [35],
the index of 2+1 dimensional sym with gauge group su(n) and 2 supercharges on r  t 2
was computed and was found to be non-vanishing for chern-simons coupling k3 > n/2. if
the period l of one of the circles in t 2 is suciently small, this theory is approximately
the 2-dimensional sym with (1,1) supersymmetry with gauge coupling g2
3/l and bf
coupling k2 = k3l [36]. imagine approaching this theory by taking l  0 keeping g2 and
k3 xed. in this limit, k2  0 in the units of g2 so the limiting theory is that of pure sym
with (1,1) supersymmetry and a vanishing bf coupling. choosing dierent values of k3 cor-
responds to a dierent choice in the path of approach to this limit. if we chose k3 > n/2, we
are guaranteed to have a non-zero index for nite l. this means that there will be a state
with zero mass in the l  0 limit also, indicating that supersymmetry is not spontaneously
broken in this limit. on the other hand, the index is not a well dened quantity in the l  0
limit, as a dierent choice of k3 will lead to a dierent value of the index in the l  0 limit.
in fact, the index can be made arbitrarily large by taking k3 to be also arbitrarily large.
this suggests that there are innitely many states forming a continuum near m = 0. the
index is therefore an ill dened quantity, akin to counting the number of exactly zero energy
states on a periodic box as one takes the volume to innity.

2 = g2

this theory is also believed not to be conning [15, 16] and is therefore expected to

exhibit non-trivial infra-red dynamics.

the sdlcq of the 1+1 dimensional model with (1,1) supersymmetry was solved in
[37, 38], and we apply these results directly in order to compute (23). for simplicity, we
work to leading order in the large n expansion. the spectrum of this theory for various
values of k, and the subsequent computation of (23) is illustrated in gure 3.a.

the spectrum of this theory at nite k, illustrated in gure 3.a, consists of 2k 2 exactly
massless states3, accompanied by large numbers of massive states separated by a gap. the
gap appears to be closing in the limit of large k however. we have tried extrapolating the
mass of the lightest massive state as a function of 1/k by performing a least square t to a line
and a parabola, giving the extrapolated value of m 2/g2
y m n = 0.6,
suggesting indeed that at large k, the gap is closed. this is consistent with the expectation
that the spectrum is that of a continuum starting at m = 0 discussed earlier, although one
must be careful when the order of large n and large k limits are exchanged. at nite n, we
expect the degeneracy of 2k  2 exactly massless states to be broken, giving rise to precisely

y m n = 1.7 and m 2/g2

3i.e. k  1 massless bosons, and their superpartners.

in the computation of the correlation function illustrated in gure 3.b, we nd a curious
feature that it asymptotes to the inverse power law c/r4 for large r. this behavior comes

we have computed this quantity as a function of 1/k and extrapolated to 1/k  0 by tting

from these massless states persists in the large k limit.

let us now turn to the model with (2,2) supersymmetry. the sdlcq version of this
model was solved in [39]. the result of this computation can be applied to (23). the result
is summarized in gure 5. this model appears to exhibit the onset of a gapless continuum
of states more rapidly than the (1,1) model as the harmonic resolution k is increased. just
as we found in the (1,1) model, this theory contains exactly massless states in the spectrum.
these massless states appear to couple to t ++|0i only for k even, and the overlap appears
to be decreasing as k is increased. we believe that this model is likely to exhibit a power
law behavior c/r for  > 4 for the t ++ correlator for r  gy mn in the large n limit.

unfortunately, the existing numerical data do not permit the reliable computation of the
exponent .

4 conclusion

in this article, we have provided a prescription for computing the correlation function of the
stress energy tensor t ++ in the sdlcq formalism, which may be readily compared with
predictions provided by a supergravity analysis following the conjecture of maldacena. such
a comparison requires non-perturbative methods on the eld theory side, and the sdlcq
approach appears at rst sight to be particularly well suited to this task. unfortunately,
at the present time, high enough resolution calculation have not been made to evaluate ex-
pression (23) accurately enough in the case of sym with 16 supercharges to reproduce (6).
signicant progress is expected however when these calculation are moved from desk top

15

computers to a supercomputer. ultimately the main obstacle will be that the number of
allowed states in the sdlcq wavefunctions grows exponentially with the resolution. never-
theless, a concrete well dened algorithm is a great starting point for further investigations,
and additional insight may be gained by studying models with less supersymmetry, as we
have done here.

thus, the answer to the question posed in the title is a qualied yes. equation (23) may
be compared against (6) using sdlcq, and unless other computational approaches such as
the lattice technique catches up, the sdlcq approach remains the most viable option.
