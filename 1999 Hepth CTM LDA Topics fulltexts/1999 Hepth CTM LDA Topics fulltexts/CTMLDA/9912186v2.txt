we construct a class of solutions to the einsteins equations for dimensions greater than or equal
to six. these solutions are characterized by a non-trivial warp factor and possess a non-compact
extra dimension. we study in detail a simple model in six dimensions containing two four branes.
one of each branes four spatial directions is compactied. the hierarchy problem is resolved by
the enormous dierence between the warp factors at the positions of the two branes, with the
standard model elds living on the brane with small warp factor. both branes can have positive
tensions. their positions, and the size of the compact dimension are determined in terms of the
fundamental parameters of the theory by a combination of two independent and comparable eects
an anisotropic contribution to the stress tensor of each brane from quantum elds living on it and a
contribution to the stress tensor from a bulk scalar eld. one overall ne tuning of the parameters
of the theory is required that for the cosmological constant.

i. introduction

the work of arkani-hamed, dimopoulos and dvali (add) [1] and of randall and sundrum (rs) [2] has stimulated
interest in explaining the observed weakness of gravity (the hierarchy problem) using extra dimensions. the add
solution requires the new dimensions to have nite but large volume, which introduces a new hierarchy between the
volume of the compact dimension and the fundamental scale of the theory1. rs proposed instead ve dimensional
spacetime with curvature comparable to the fundamental scale, and showed that a massless graviton can be localized
to a 3+1 dimensional hypersurface known as the planck brane. in their setup the extra dimension may be taken
innitely large, and four dimensional general relativity still agrees to high precision with long distance experimental
measurement. the weakness of observed gravity is explained provided the standard model elds are localized to a 3+1
dimensional tev brane, where the graviton wave function is small. due to the exponential fall-o of the graviton
wave function away from the planck brane, the distance between the tev brane and the planck brane does not need
to be large in units of the fundamental scale. randall and lykken (rl) [5] have shown that an innite fth dimension
is experimentally quite consistent with such a resolution of the hierarchy problem.

in such a picture, it is necessary to introduce dynamics which determines the location of the tev brane relative to
the planck brane. if this interbrane distance is not xed, it becomes a massless modulus which leads to unnacceptable
cosmology [6] and experimental consequences. goldberger and wise showed that adding a scalar eld which propagates
in the bulk and has a source on the branes is sucient to x this distance [7]. several other suggestions have been
made for bulk dynamics to x the extra dimensional conguration [8].

in this paper we rst construct a class of solutions to the einsteins equations for dimensions greater than or equal
to six. these solutions are characterized by a non-trivial warp factor and possess a non-compact extra dimension.
we then study in detail a simple model in six dimensions containing two four branes that employs a metric of this
form to address the hierarchy problem. one of each branes four spatial directions is compactied on a circle of small
radius. the hierarchy problem is resolved as in the rs and rl models by the enormous dierence in the warp factors
at the positions of the two branes, with the standard model elds living on the brane with small warp factor.

in this model the positions of the branes, and hence the magnitude of the hierarchy, are determined by the combi-
nation of two independent eects. the rst is an anisotropic contribution to the stress tensor of each brane arising
from the quantum eects of elds localised to it. the second is a contribution to the stress tensor from a scalar bulk
eld as in the model of goldberger and wise. these eects are naturally comparable in size and together can yield a
suciently large value of the brane spacing to solve the hierarchy problem without ne tuning of parameters.

1for examples of theories which naturally have nite but exponentially large volume for the additional dimensions see ref. [3].
for earlier work on large extra dimensions and/or a low quantum gravity scale see refs. [4].

the reason for the rst eect is that the theory contains a compact dimension, in addition to the noncompact
dimension r. the size of the compact dimension is in general an r dependent function, which is determined from the
einsteins equations. we argue that in general the component of the brane tension in the compact dimension will
depend on its size, due to the quantum eects of elds localized to the brane. then a consistent solution to einsteins
equations will x each brane location at a particular value of r. however in this model this eect by itself does not
give rise to a large hierarchy without ne tuning. nevertheless when combined with the eect of a bulk scalar eld
on the geometry it is possible to realise a large hierarchy without ne tuning of parameters.

both branes in the theory can have positive tensions and the solution is free of singularities where general relativity
might break down. one overall ne tuning of the parameters in the theory is required to adjust the four dimensional
cosmological constant to zero.

ii. the ansatz, equations of motion and solutions

we begin by looking for solutions to the einstein equations in d dimensions, where d is greater than or equal
to six, in the presence of a constant background bulk cosmological constant. we assume all sources other than the
bulk cosmological constant are restricted to subspaces of lower dimension. hence our approach will be to rst solve
the equations of motion in the bulk to obtain solutions with a number of constants of integration that can then be
adjusted to nd solutions for various boundary conditions.

the action in the bulk is

s =z ddx

g(2m d2

 r  b) .

(1)

we label a general coordinate by xm where m runs from 0 to (d-1). we restrict our search to metrics of the simple

form

ds2 = f (z)dxdx + s(z)dy2 + dz2

(2)

where  and  run from 0 to d-3. the remaining two coordinates are labelled by y and z. here the warp factors f
and s are assumed to be functions only of z.

the einsteins equations in the bulk take the form

this has the form of a rst order dierential equation for f 

f . this dierential equation is straightforward to solve,
and we can then obtain f itself by performing a simple integration. we then use the result obtained for f in eqn. (6)
and the problem of determining s also then reduces to performing a simple integral. the results are

here f0, s0 and c are constants to be determined by boundary conditions. in the limits of vanishing c and innite
c we recover the usual anti desitter (ads) metric. it is easy to see that in fact for any values of these constants the
warp factors f and s change very rapidly as function of z. in particular there are always values of z where they are
changing exponentially quickly. this suggests that these metrics are good candidates for a solution to the hierarchy
problem.

it is possible to use the class of metrics above to nd solutions to the einstein equations for various source congu-
rations and geometries2. in the next section we exhibit a potential solution to the hierarchy problem based on these
metrics.

iii. the model

a. the metric

in this section we limit our interest to a solution where the fth dimension y is compact and corresponds to an angle
in the higher dimensional space. we relabel y by  in this section and hereafter to emphasize its angular character.
the angle  runs from zero to 2. we allow the coordinate z to be non-compact and run from zero to innity.
it
corresponds to a radius in the higher dimensional space. we relabel it by r to emphasize its radial character.

the geometry of our model consists of two four branes localized in the higher dimensional space at dierent values
of r. their positions are specied by the equations r = a and r = b where a < b. they can therefore be thought of
as being similar to the surfaces of two innitely long concentric cylinders in the higher dimensional space, with the
regular four dimensions parallel to the common axis of the cylinders, the fth dimension going around the surface but
perpendicular to the axis, and the sixth dimension being the radius. (this intuitive picture does not account for the
fact that the space is curved.) the standard model elds are localized to the brane at r = a. the hierarchy problem
will be resolved by the enormous dierence between the values of the warp factor at r = a and r = b.

because the coordinate  is compact the four brane appears as a three brane at suciently long length scales.
the branes divide the space into three distinct sections; 0 < r < a , a < r < b, and r > b. in general there is no
reason for the bulk cosmological constants in these three sections to be the same since the branes may be separating
dierent phases of the theory. in what follows we will assume that they are dierent and will associate the three
regions with three dierent values of ; 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

the solutions of the einstein equations in the three regions will be of the form of equations (9) and (10) but with
dierent values of the constants f0, s0 and c. we will give these constants an additional subscript i, where i runs
from 1 to 3, in order to dierentiate them in the three dierent regions.

now the constant c1 is xed to be -1 by the requirement that the solution be non-singular at the origin. this
requirement also xes the value of s01 to be (216/5/(252)). to see that this choice does indeed smooth out the
singularity at the origin we rst examine the behavior of the the functions f (r) and s(r) as r tends to 0,

we then go to the cartesian coordinate system which is smooth at the origin.

f (r) = const + o(r2)
s(r) = r2 + o(r4) .

x = r cos 
y  = r sin  .

(11)
(12)

(13)
(14)

2note that these solutions are coordinate transformations of the bulk solutions found in ref. [9].

3

it is straightforward to verify that in this coordinate system the components of the metric and their rst and second

derivatives (which go into the ricci tensor) are smooth at the origin, showing that there is no singularity there.

the requirement that the metric be bounded at innity determines that the space outside r = b be ads. this
corresponds to setting c3 to innity while keeping the products c3f03 and c3s03 nite. we relabel these products by
f3 and s3 respectively.

we are now in a position to write down the forms of the solutions in the three regions. for r < a,

f = f01e1r[1 + e 5

2 1r]

4
5

s = s01e1r[1 + e 5

2 1r]

6

5 [1  e 5

2 1r]2 .

for b > r > a,

for r > b,

f = f02e2r[1  c2e 5

2 2r]

4
5

s = s02e2r[1  c2e 5

2 2r]

6

5 [1 + c2e 5

2 2r]2

f = f3e3r ,

s = s3e3r .

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

the constant f01 is determined by normalizing the warp factor f to 1 at the position of the visible brane. the
constant s01 was determined earlier. all the other constants above as well as the positions of the branes a and b must
be determined by matching across the branes.

we now write down the action for the branes.

sb =z dxmp g((r  a)[lm1  1] + (r  b))[lm2  2]) .

(21)

here g is the determinant of the metric tensor in the ve dimensional subspace, 1 and 2 are the cosmological

constants on the two branes, and lm1 and lm2 are the lagrangians of matter elds localized to the branes.

the stress tensor for each brane has the form

tab = t 

ab+ < t m

ab >

(22)

where t  is the contribution from the cosmological constant and < t m > the expectation value of the stress tensor
of the matter elds living on the brane. we will be working in the semi-classical limit, treating gravity completely
classically but accounting for the quantum eects of matter localized to the branes.

assuming the matter on the brane is in its ground state, tab is constrained by four dimensional lorentz invariance

to be of the form

where 2 and 2 are constants associated with each brane that we require to be positive. the form of t  is more
constrained since it is proportional to gab, which would imply that 2 = 2 if the only contribution to t came from
the cosmological constant on the brane. thus the deviation of t from the gab form is due entirely to the contribution
from the matter lagrangian. in a subsequent section we will show that the contribution to the stress tensor from the
zero point energies of elds living on the brane lead to  6= . in general  and  will depend on the geometrical
factors a, b and c2 due to the quantum contribution to the stress tensor from matter localized on the brane.
now the einstein equations for the upper 5 by 5 block of the ricci tensor get modied in the presence of the branes

(24)

since we already have the solution in the bulk we can get the complete solution by matching across the branes.
the metric tensor is continuous across the branes but its derivatives are not. the above equation xes the jump
discontinuity in the derivatives across the boundary.

looking at the above equations we have three parameters c2, a and b which have to satisfy four independent
equations. hence a ne tuning is necessary. this is the ne tuning necessary to set the eective four dimensional
cosmological constant to zero. once this ne tuning has been made it is straightforward to nd solutions to the above
equations without singularities where all parameters are of order one in terms of the fundamental scale m. however
since we want to generate a hierarchy we want 2b = o(40)  1. from now on we will assume that b is the only large
parameter in the problem and that it is therefore responsible for generating the hierarchy. subtracting eqn. (31) from
eqn. (32) we see that

(33)

note that from the denition of  it is clear that if  = , then  = . but the dierence between  and  arises
from the vacuum energy of quantum elds localized to the brane (the casimir eect), which vanishes in the limit of
large proper radius for the compact dimension. as will be discussed in a subsequent section the casimir eect is nite
and regulator independent in the limit that the cuto is taken to innity. then by dimensional considerations if the
elds on the brane are massless the right hand side must be of order [2s(b)] 5
2 since the proper size of the compact
dimension is the only scale in the problem. then the equation above becomes

5

f (c2, b, 2)

f (c2, b, 2) = const[e 5

2 2b(1  c2e 5

2 2b)3(1 + c2e 5

2 2b)5] ,

(34)

where the constant above is of order one in units of the fundamental scale. while we see that both sides of this
equation are the same order of magnitude even for large b we also see that b only appears in the combination e 5
2 2b.
it is this combination which is determined in terms of the various tensions. hence although the brane spacing is xed,
a large value for 2b is only possible through a ne tuning of parameters which is over and above the ne tuning
necessary to set the four dimensional cosmological constant to zero. in the next section we shall show that by adding

5

a scalar eld in the bulk `a la goldberger and wise [7] the matching conditions at the branes can be made more
sensitive to b and the hierarchy can be made natural3.

equating the various components of the metric across the boundary xes the values of the coecients f02, s02,
f3, and s3. once again there are four equations but there are now four unknowns so there is no further ne tuning
required.

fig 1. plot of warp factor of compact dimension (circumference of circles) versus r (vertical axis), illustrating why we
call this the space needle metric. the apparent singularity at the top, where r = 0, is a coordinate singularity only.

this completes the determination of the metric in the absence of any bulk matter. the warp factor for the fth
dimension is plotted in gure 1 for a choice of parameters for which there is a large hierarchy. the warp factor for the
usual 3+1 dimensions is qualitatively similar, except near r = 0 where it goes to a constant. we call this the space
needle metric for reasons which are obvious from the picture.

b. model with bulk scalar fields

in this section we show that when the model of the previous section is modied by the inclusion of bulk scalar

elds, the hierarchy can be made natural.

the action for the scalar eld

(m m   m22) +p gf ()(r  a) +p gh()(r  b) .

here m is the mass of the scalar eld in the bulk. we will be interested in the limit m2  2, since this is where
we naturally obtain a large hierarchy. the scalar eld sources f () and h() are in general arbitrary functions. for
simplicity we will take

3note that the necessary ne tuning of the planck 4-brane tension might also be natural if the 4-brane is an approximate
bps state of a nearly supersymmetric theory. thus supersymmetry of the bulk action might provide an alternative solution to
the hierarchy problem.

6

f () = 1
h() = 2 .

(36)
(37)

the coupled equations for the gravity-matter system are dicult to solve. we shall address the problem by a
successive approximation method. we will rst solve for the gravitational eld in the absence of the scalar eld,
assuming that the contribution to the stress tensor of this eld is small. we will then solve for the scalar eld in this
geometry, and compute the stress tensor t of the scalar eld. we then can substitute this solution back into the
einstein equations to determine the correction to the geometry induced by the stress tensor of the scalar eld4. if we
6, can be carried out to higher orders but the lowest
wish, this procedure, which is essentially an expansion in t/m
order will be sucient to to x the brane spacing, which we expect will receive only small corrections at higher orders.

for simplicity we will take as a starting metric

r < a

f0 = 1
f0 = eaer
f0 = eae2ber

a < r < b

r > b ,

s0 = r2
r < a
s0 = a2eaer
s0 = a2eae2ber

a < r < b

r > b .

(39)
(40)

(41)
(42)
(43)

this corresponds to a solution for the special case with no bulk cosmological constant for r < a but the same
cosmological constant everywhere outside, and c2 = 0. this metric is at in the neighborhood of the origin and
pure ads outside a. this is a special case, with 1 and c2 set to zero, of the more general class of metrics we have
considered in section iiia. non-zero c2 will be treated perturbatively in what follows and we will also indicate how
to include 1 perturbatively. hence the only loss of generality arising from this starting metric is that we can only
extend our conclusions to the more general class of metrics of the previous section when c2 and 1 are suciently
small that a perturbative approach is valid.

we rst solve for the scalar eld in this background metric. the equation of motion is

here the requirement that the metric die away at innity has been imposed. this completes the determination of
bulk corrections to the metric. the nal step is to match across the branes thereby determining the brane positions
and the undetermined constant d.

the conditions on the continuity of the metric across the brane are straightforward to satisfy because of the
additional constants of integration that will be obtained on integrating the expressions for  and . once f has been
normalized to one on the visible brane and the requirement of smoothness has been met at r = 0 all these additional
constants will have been xed.

we now focus our attention on the jump conditions on the derivatives. at the inner brane we have

these are four independent equations for the three unknowns a, b and d. just as in the previous section, the
metric and brane locations are completely determined with one overall ne tuning needed to nd a poincare invariant
solution.

first consider the situation without the scalar eld, i.e. t = 0. this is the same case which was considered in the
previous section. in general, as we found, the metric beween the branes need not be pure ads even without a scalar
eld. the tensions of the branes must be netuned to set d to zero. we are allowing these brane tensions (which are
related to 2 and 2 in the above equations) to deviate from those ne tuned values by small amounts. here small
merely means that perturbation theory is valid. then it is straightforward to verify that the equations (74) to (77)
are simply linearized versions of equations (29) to (32) with 1 = 0 and the parameter d is proportional to c2. hence
even in the absence of the scalar eld the metric between the branes is not of the ads form, and our conclusions once
the scalar eld is introduced will be valid for this more general class of metrics. setting t in the above formulas to a

9

constant non zero value for r < a corresponds to allowing non zero 1. although it is straightforward to accomodate
non zero 1 perturbatively in this framework, for simplicity we shall keep 1 = 0 in what follows below, and t will
be related only to t and will not include any piece from a cosmological constant.

we now return to the general case with a scalar eld. we are interested in a solution with all parameters of order
one in units of the fundamental scale but we allow m2/2 to be somewhat less than one in order to obtain a hierarchy.
rather than give the exact solution we will give the more informative order of magnitude results. for dimensional
considerations any parameter of order one in units of the fundamental scale will be denoted by the appropriate power
of .

the matching conditions at the inner brane, eqs. (74) and (75), determine a and d as functions of b. provided
m2b/ is less than or of order one, a and d are of order one in units of the fundamental scale. the dependence of d
on b is

d = o() + o(m2b) .

(78)

this result will turn out to be crucial for the solution of the hierarchy problem.

both the equations at the outer brane are sensitive to b and a only through exponentially small terms. this is
because the value of  and its derivatives is exponentially insensitive to b and a in this region, which manifests itself
in the forms of  and  close to the outer brane. this is similar to the insensitivity to b of equations (31) and (32).
one might therefore worry that just as in the previous case an exponentially precise ne tuning will be necessary
to get a hierarchy. however the netuning in the previous case was related to the fact that near the planck-brane
the metric was very nearly pure ads, which is a homogenous space, and the compact dimension was exponentially
large, so that the location of the planck brane had very little eect on the matching conditions at either brane. in
the present case with a light bulk scalar the value of the scalar at the tev brane depends more sensitively on b. to
determine b, add equations (76) and (77) to obtain

5
2

de 5

2 b = (2)2  (2)2 .

(79)

this is the analogue of equation (33) in the previous section. recall that (2)2  (2)2 arises from the vacuum
2 b. then this equation, together with equation

energy of quantum elds localised on the brane and is of order e 5
(78) which relates d to b, determines b as

b = o(cid:16) 

m2(cid:17) .

(80)

clearly m need not be much smaller than  to get a sizable hierarchy. the dierence of equations (76) and (77),
which we have not yet used, becomes the condition that the eective four dimensional cosmological constant is zero,
which is the usual netuning5.

one limitation of the above approach is that the inner brane necessarily has negative tension along the non compact
directions. this is a consequence of the choice of a starting metric with zero 1 and c2 and the fact that deviations
from this metric can only be perturbative. the nonzero 1 case is not simple but there is a limit in which it is
tractable  that in which (1a)2 is perturbatively less than one, even though 1 is not small. in this limit, neglecting
higher order terms in (1r)2 we nd

(82)

we can substitute for this in equation (44) and nd that to the order shown the solution (45) is unchanged. now
1a > 2 the inner brane can have positive tension and it is straightforward to verify that all the other conclusions

if 2
above go through as before.

5work is in progress to see whether this netuning can be made more natural though supersymmetry of the bulk action when

the planck brane is approximately bps.

10

to determine the eective four dimensional planck scale we concentrate on the higher dimensional einstein action.

when the two extra dimensions are integrated out this will contain the usual four dimensional einstein action.

expanding g =  + h and integrating out the two extra dimensions we see that

and consequently

2m 4

 z drfs = m 2

(83)

(84)

(85)

rather than do this integral exactly we will be satised with an estimate. the dominant contribution to the integral
comes from the region close to the outer brane where the integrand is very large and the forms of f and s are very
nearly simple exponentials. for the purposes of the estimate we set 3 = 2 = a1 = m = .

m 2

(86)

this large exponent is responsible for the hierarchy between the planck scale and the weak scale.
next we analyze the spectrum of linearized tensor uctuations to see if it is consistent with the results of gravitational
experiments. we neglect the eect of the scalar eld in what follows since we do not expect it to qualitatively aect
our results because its contribution to the energy density is small.

expanding

and substituting this into the lagrangian we get the following equation for the uctuation h in the bulk.

fth direction.

the boundary conditions that h has to satisfy are h(0) = 0 at the origin and

(89)

clearly h = f is a solution of this equation with m = 0 by comparison with eqns. (5) and (6). this is the massless
graviton. there is a continuum of other solutions for all positive m2, as can be seen from the asymptotic behavior of
the equation. however to extract these solutions is not easy, because of the complicated forms of f and s. however
since we are only interested in order of magnitude estimates we can simplify the problem by considering instead a
simpler problem that retains the physics we are interested in. consider the metric

r < a

f = 1
f = eaer
f = eae2ber

a < r < b

r > b

s = r2
r < a
s = a2eaer
s = a2eae2ber

r > b .

this corresponds to a solution for the case with no cosmological constant for r < a but the same cosmological
constant everywhere outside. this metric is at in the neighborhood of the origin, ads outside a. it clearly has a
form very similar to the metric we are interested in for r  a, although unlike our case, the positions of the branes
are not xed and one has negative tension. in what follows we will assume the main features of the excitations we
are interested in are common to both metrics and proceed.

we get an equation for g as a function of q which has the form of an eigenvalue equation for m2 with unit density

proportional so we can conveniently choose the constant so that g = h in this region. also q and q3 as dened dier
at most by an additive constant. hence for the continuum modes we merely have to normalize the solution for h for
r > b with respect to q3.

we are now in a position to determine the corrections to gravity from the kaluza klein excitations of the graviton.

(117)

from this it is clear that deviations from newtonian gravity are highly suppressed at long distances.
we now explain why we expect this model to have the same physical implications as the model we started out with.
essentially for r  a the general solution of both models will have similar form. the only dierence will be in the
magnitudes of the coecients a2 and b2. although these coecients are determined by matching in the interior their
order of magnitude follows from simple dimensional considerations. this then implies that a3 and b3 and hence the
normalization of the modes can be xed by dimensional considerations. hence the two theories will give the same
order of magnitude estimate for the the corrections to newtonian gravity.

because of the isometry of the compact dimension this theory contains a massless gravi-photona kaluza-klein
u (1) gauge boson. however no light or massless elds will carry non-trivial u(1) charge since they have no momentum
in the compact dimension. we expect that other than the modes we have already discussed, the remaining spectrum
of gravitational excitations will be massive.

a more comprehensive study of the phenomenological implications of this model is left for future work.

d. stress energy tensor for a field localized to a brane

in this section we consider the form of the stress energy tensor for a eld localized to a brane having the metric
gab = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1) but in which the fth dimension is compact and has proper size a. we show that in the
ground state the stress tensor does indeed have the form given in eqn. (23). for simplicity we limit ourselves to the
case of a free scalar eld.

the lagrangian has the form

we are interested in the expectation value of the stress tensor in the ground state.

since the usual three space dimensions are innite the sums over momenta in these three directions can be replaced
by integrals. however since the fth dimension  is compact the momenta in this direction remain discrete, k5 = n/a

these integrals are innite and must be regulated in order to yield sensible physical results. we will use a pauli-
villars regulator, adding massive elds with appropriate statistics until all the divergences have been removed. (we
could get similar results in a theory with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.) we simplify to the special case where
the boson eld is massless. then all the divergences can be removed by adding three elds with opposite statistics
having masses m ,m and 2m and two elds with the same statistics which both have mass 3m . here m is assumed
to be some kind of cut o for the theory.

performing the integrals and adding the contributions from the various elds we get the nite but regulator depen-

this (1/a)5 result for the dierence could have been anticipated. since the only counterterm allowed by general
covariance is the cosmological constant which contributes equally to both t n
5 , the dierence between these
two must be nite and regulator independent in the limit that the cuto is taken to innity. for a massless eld, a
is the only available dimensionful parameter. this result is just a higher dimensional form of the casimir force.

iv. conclusions

we have constructed a set of solutions to einsteins equations in six or more dimensions, and exhibited a six
dimensional set up, the space needle, with two concentric positive tension 4-branes, which each have one compact
dimension. gravity is mostly localized to the outer brane while we assume the standard model lives on the inner
brane, explaining the apparent weakness of gravity in our world. there are no massless moduli associated with either
the size of the compact dimension or the brane locations. this provides an explicit demonstration that the gauge
hierarchy problem can be solved in six dimensions, without supersymmetry, and with negligible corrections to gravity
at distances longer than an inverse tev. gravitational eects do become strong at energies of order a tev. we leave
discussion of gravitational collider phenomenology of new noncompact dimensions for future work.

we do not address the important issue of how to obtain chiral fermions on the standard model brane. ordinary
dimensional reduction by compactifying the fth dimension on a circle always results in a non-chiral theory. one
simple alternate possibility is to have the standard model live on a 3-brane at the center of space. then it is only
necessary to have one 4-branethe planck brane. the metric is simply the a  0 limit of the space needle metric.
alternatively, it may be possible to generalize our mechanism to additional dimensions with some compactication
which does allow a chiral eective theory on the tev brane.

we also do not address the cosmological constant problem. the eective four dimensional cosmological constant
depends on a complicated function of the bulk and brane parameters, and may be netuned to zero or to a small
acceptable value.
