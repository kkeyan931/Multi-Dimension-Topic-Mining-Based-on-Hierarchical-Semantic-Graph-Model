abstract

in this paper we study the n = 1 supersymmetric eld theories realized on the world-
volume of type iib d3-branes sitting at orientifolds of non-orbifold singularities

(conifold and generalizations). several chiral models belong to this family of theories.

these eld theories have a t-dual realization in terms of type iia congurations

of relatively rotated ns vebranes, d4-branes and orientifold six-planes, with a
compact x6 direction, along which the d4-branes have nite extent. we compute

the spectrum on the d3-branes directly in the type iib picture and match the

resulting eld theories with those obtained in the type iia setup, thus providing

a non-trivial check of this t-duality. since the usual techniques to compute the

spectrum of the model and check the cancellation of tadpoles, cannot be applied

to the case orientifolds of non-orbifold singularities, we use a dierent approach,
and construct the models by partially blowing-up orientifolds of c3/(z2  z2) and
c3/(z2  z3) orbifolds.

1 introduction

the recent developments in the study of supersymmetric eld theories by embedding

them into string theory has proted from the interplay of dierent approaches. the

most relevant ones for our purposes in this paper are the realization in terms of d-

branes in the presence of ns-branes (and possibly other higher-dimensional d-branes)

[1, 2, 3, 4], and in terms of d-branes probes at spacetime singularities [5, 6]. these two

broad classes of constructions are related by t-dualities [7, 8, 9, 10], which transform

the ns-vebranes into geometric singularities [11]. this type of mapping allows to

answer dierent questions in the dierent pictures. thus, the brane congurations of

ns-branes and d-branes are very intuitive and allow to easily classify large classes of

models and their corresponding eld theories. on the other hand, the picture of branes

at singularities contains only perturbative objects and is better suited for some explicit

computations of perturbative eects in the corresponding eld theory, for instance

anomaly cancellation conditions and one-loop beta functions [12, 13]. also, the large

n limit of the eld theory can be studied in term of a dual supergravity (or superstring)

background by means of the ads/cft correspondence [14].

in this paper we are going to consider type iia congurations of ns-vebranes (with
world-volume along the directions 012345), ns-branes (along 012389), with d4-branes
(along 01236) suspended between them, and in the presence of d6-branes and o6-

planes (both along 0123457). these constructions realize a variety of four-dimensional
n = 1 supersymmetric gauge eld theories on the d4-brane world-volume. congu-
rations of this type, but without orientifold planes, were rst introduced in [2]. the

introductions of orientifold planes was discussed in [15, 16, 17] (see also [18, 19]).

we will be interested in congurations where the direction x6, along which the d4-

branes are suspended between the ns vebranes, is compactied on a circle. our basic

aim is to understand the resulting congurations after performing a t-duality along

this direction. there are basically two motivations for this. the rst is that the iib

t-dual picture provides an interesting insight into several non-trivial brane dynamics

eects that occur on the type iia side, and which are related to chiral symmetries

and chiral matter in the gauge eld theory. these include the appearance of chiral
symmetries and chiral avours when a half-d6 brane ends on a ns-brane [20], the
appearance of chiral matter due to the change of sign of the o6-plane charge when

it crosses a ns-brane [15, 16, 17]. the type iib realization of these eects has been

studied in [21] (some had been previously observed in [22]) in the simpler case where

1

ns-branes are absent 1. this paper can be regarded as an extension of these result to

more general models.

the second and maybe more interesting motivation is that the t-dual congurations

involve orientifolds of non-orbifold singularities. this can be seen as follows. type iia
congurations of k ns-branes, k ns-branes and d4-branes, without orientifold planes,
but with compact direction x6, transform under t-duality into a set of d3-branes
probing the non-orbifold singularity xy = zkwk [9] (see also [10] for the particular case
k = k = 1). therefore, it is reasonable to expect the iia models with o6-planes

to correspond to suitable orientifolds of these non-orbifold spaces. in this paper we

would like to construct such orientifolds directly on the iib side and compare the

resulting eld theories on the d3-brane probes with those obtained in the iia setup.

unfortunately, this problem is rather dicult, since the usual techniques to compute

the eld theory spectrum and check the cancellation of twisted rr tadpoles (and ensure

the consistency of the string theory congurations) do not apply, since the world-sheet

description of these models is not a free conformal eld theory. on the other hand, this

means that the type iia congurations can provide, through the t-duality, interesting

information about the possible consistent orientifolds of non-orbifold spaces. in this

paper, however, we will construct the iib models directly and use the results as new

support for the t-duality proposal.

the procedure we use is based in the observation in [23] that one can construct

non-orbifold singularities as partial resolutions of orbifold singularities. the eect of

the blow-ups appears in the d3-brane eld theory as specic higgs breakings which

can be identied in a precise manner. the eective eld theory along the higgs branch

gives the eld theory of the d3-branes at the non-orbifold singularity. we apply this

idea in the presence of an additional orientifold projection; that is, we study partial res-

olutions of orientifolds of orbifold singularities to construct orientifolds of non-orbifold

singularities. due to the complexity of the method (concretely, the identication of

the higgsing associated to a specic blow-up) we will mainly discuss the simplest ex-

amples with at most three ns vebranes. some comments about more general cases

are mentioned at the end.

as mentioned above, the singularity realization of these eld theories provides a

simple description of several exotic phenomena in the iia side. this point was already

stressed in the simplest context of [21], so we will not insist on it here. another inter-

esting observation suggested by our constructions is that the chiral theories obtained
1notice that our models have n = 1 supersymmetry before the orientifold projection, whereas [21]

considered n = 1 orientifolds of n = 2 models.

2

in the iia framework (and other related n = 1 models) are continuously connected to
other chiral theories obtained by orientifolding orbifold singularities. the relation is

the process of blowing-up of the singularity probed by the d3-branes, or equivalently

the higgs breaking in the eld theory. we nd this picture quite reassuring, and sat-

isfactory, since it suggests a unied description for all chiral gauge theories which can

be embedded in string theory.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review the eld theories arising
from type iia congurations with ns-branes, ns-branes and d4-branes, with the

direction 6 compact, but without orientifold planes. we also review the t-duality

with sets of d3-branes at non-orbifold singularities. as a preparation for analogous

computations in the orientifolded case, we review the construction in [23] of the eld
theories on d3-branes at the conifold (xy = zw) and suspended pinch point (xy = zw2)
singularities, by blowing up the c3/(z2  z2) orbifold singularity. the techniques of
toric geometry required for these computations have been conned to section 2.2.1, so

that it can be (hopefully) safely avoided by readers not interested in them.

in section 3 we turn to the type iia congurations including o6-planes. as ex-
plained above, we center on the simplest examples, with one ns-brane and one ns-
brane (which t-dualize to orientifolds of the conifold), or one ns-brane and two ns-

branes (which t-dualize to orientifolds of the suspended pinch point).

the type iib orientifolds of the suspended pinch point, xy = zw2, are the subject

of section 4. they can be obtained as partial resolutions of suitable orientifolds of
c3/(z2  z2). these are constructed in section 4.1, where we also check explicitly
the cancellation of tadpoles.
in section 4.2 we discuss the blow-ups which provide
the orientifolds of xy = zw2, and the associated eld theory higgsings. the resulting

eld theories match nicely those obtained from the type iia constructions. we also

comment on some interesting results obtained upon continuing blowing-up.

in section 5 we discuss orientifolds of the conifold. these cannot be obtained by
resolving orientifolds of c3/(z2  z2), since the orientifold projection eliminates the
required blow-up mode. however, they can be constructed by resolving orientifolds
of c3/(z2  z3) . we describe the highlights of the computations involved, and
describe the results. the eld theories obtained after the higgsing again reproduce

those obtained from the iia side.

finally, in section 6 we make several remarks concerning the generalization of our
results to arbitrary singularities xy = zkwk (t-duals of models with k ns-branes and
k ns-branes, and end with some nal comments.

2 rotated branes and non-orbifold singularities

we start with a brief review of some simple iia brane congurations, and their iib

t-dual version as d3-branes at singularities, before the introduction of orientifold pro-

jections.

2.1 n = 1 elliptic models
there is a natural way to break the n = 2 supersymmetry of the elliptic models
considered in [24] to n = 1, namely to use ns-vebranes whose world-volumes are
relatively rotated.
in this paper we will consider only vebranes with worldvolume
along 012345 (denoted ns-branes) and along 012389 (denoted ns-branes). thus we

restrict to vebranes which are either parallel or orthogonal, even when more general

angles are allowed. this type of congurations was rst considered in [2] (see [3] for
further references) in models with non-compact x6. we will be interested in models
with x6 compact, which were discussed in [9, 25]. we will refer to them as n = 1
elliptic models.

k ns-branes and l ns-branes, we obtain a gauge groupqk+l
u(1), ignored in the following), and bifundamental chiral multiplets pk+l

it is straightforward to read o the resulting n = 1 eld theories. for a model with
i=1 su(ni) (times a decoupled
i+1) +
i+1) ]. we also get a massless adjoint whenever two adjacent vebranes are parallel,
( i,
which parametrizes a coulomb branch in which d4-branes slide along the ns-branes.

i=1 [ ( i,

when two adjacent vebranes are orthogonal, there is quartic superpotential for the

bifundamental elds living at the ends of the interval (see [9] for more details).

in [9] (and in [10] in a particular case) it was argued that a t-duality along x6 maps
this conguration to a system of d3-branes at a non-orbifold singularity2 xy = zlwk.

the result follows from the t-duality between a ns vebrane and a taub-nut space

xy = v [11]. in the general case, the singularity requires additional data to specify
the eld theory completely. in particular, the dierent orderings of ns and ns branes
in x6 corresponds to a specic choice of b-elds in the collapsed two-cycles in the

singularity. this subtlety will not arise in the particular models we study.

the main examples we will consider are depicted in gure 1. the rst conguration,
gure 1a, contains one ns brane and one ns brane. it realizes a eld theory with the

after t-dualizing along x6 this conguration maps to a set of d3 branes at a conifold

branes at the conifold singularity, on the basis of strong evidence from the ads/cft

correspondence.

(2.4)

after t-duality, this conguration transforms into a set of d3 branes at the so-called
suspended pinch point (spp) singularity, xy = zw2. this t-duality is supported by

5

the fact that independent arguments [23] (to be reviewed in the following section) imply

that the above eld theory is indeed realized on d3-branes at the spp singularity.

it is rather dicult to study d3-branes at non-orbifold singularities, the reason

being that they are not described by free world-sheet conformal eld theories. from

this point of view it is fortunate that for toric singularities there exists a systematic

(though involved) approach, based on [6] and developed in [23], that allows to compute

the spectrum and interactions of the d3-brane eld theory. therefore, before entering

the study of the orientifold models, which are more complicated, it will be convenient

to review the description of the conifold and spp models using these techniques.

2.2 non-orbifold singularities from orbifold singularities

the main observation is that the non-orbifold singularities of interest, the conifold
xy = zw and the spp xy = zw2, can be constructed as partial resolutions of the
c3/(z2  z2) orbifold singularity. the latter is obtained upon modding out the c3
parametrized by (z1, z2, z3) by the group generated by

 :

 :

(z1, z2, z3)  (z1, z2,z3)
(z1, z2, z3)  (z1,z2,z3)

(2.5)

dening invariant variables, x = z2

3, w = z1z2z3, the space can be

1, y = z2

2, z = z2

describe as the hypersurface

xyz = w2

(2.6)

in c4. this space can be blown-up once by introducing a ip1 parametrized by w = w/z
(in the coordinate patch z 6= 0). the remaining singularity has the form

xy = zw 2

(2.7)

which is a suspended pinch point singularity. there are two inequivalent ways of per-

forming a further blow-up. the rst possibility is to introduce a ip1 parametrized e.g.
by x = x/w. the remaining singularity is the conifold xy = zw. the second possi-
bility is to introduce a ip1 parametrized e.g. by y = y/z. the remaining singularity is
xy = w2, the c2/z2  c orbifold. for any of these two possibilities further blow-ups
yield a completely smooth space.

our aim in this section is to construct the eld theory of d3-branes at these non-
orbifold singularities by starting with the well-known system of d3-branes at c3/(z2
z2) and following the eect of the above blow-ups in the eld theory.

6

the eld theory of a set of d3-branes at a c3/(z2  z2) singularity can be easily
constructed following [6]. we mod out a system of d3 branes in at space by the action

(2.5), embedded on the d3-brane chan-paton factors through the matrices

,3 = diag (1n1, 1n2,1n3,1n4)

(2.11)

we would like to interpret the eect of the blow-ups in this eld theory. it is well-

known [5, 6] that blow-up modes couple to the eld theory as fayet-iliopoulos (fi)

terms, which trigger a higgs breaking of the gauge group when turned on (when the

disappearance of the u(1)s is taken into account, these modes correspond to baryonic

expectation values). the framework to compute the precise mapping between the

resolutions of the singularity and the higgsing in the eld theory has been provided in
[6], and analyzed in [34] in the case of the z2  z2 orbifold. it is based on regarding
the threefold singularity as the moduli space of the d3-brane eld theory, and on

computing this moduli space as a function of the fayet-iliopoulos terms. below we
review this computation for the relevant resolutions of the c3/(z2  z2) orbifold.
readers interested in the result rather than in its detailed derivation are adviced to

skip the discussion until subsection ii.

3we momentarily maintain the u (1) factors in the gauge group.

7

2.2.1 construction of the moduli space

in what follows we concentrate on the u(1)4 gauge theory of one d3-brane probe, and

construct its moduli space as a function of the corresponding fi coecients i. it is
clear that the twelve elds xij, yij, zij (collectively denoted ra, a = 1, . . . , 12 in what
follows) cannot acquire arbitrary independent vevs. rather, the f-term equations allow

to express them in terms of the vevs of just six elds, for instance x13, x24, y21, y34,
z14, z32 (subsequently denoted by ra, a = 1, . . . , 6). these relations can be written

ra =

thus, we have x31 = x24z32/z14 (as required from the equation of motion for y43),
x42 = x13z32/z14, and so on.

we would like to nd a set of variables p, whose vevs are not restricted by any
f-term equations, and such that the variables ra can be expressed as products of ps

in a way consistent with the relations (2.12). namely, we look for relations ra = q pta

such that in the resulting equation

y43 = p1p4p5

; z41 = p4p7p8

(2.16)

however, this parametrization has redundancies, since dierent assignments of vevs for
the p may lead to the same vevs for the ra (and consequently for the ra). to eliminate
this redundancy we must mod out by a set of c actions on the ps such that they leave
the ras invariant. if we denote by qn the weight of p under the nth c transformation,

the invariance of ra is ensured if p taqn = 0, that is t qt = 0 in matrix notation.

equivalently (see [35] for further details about the equivalence of the holomorphic
and symplectic versions of this quotient), this can be described as introducing a set
of u(1) gauge symmetries (with zero fi terms) for the ps with charge assignments
qn, such that the ra are gauge invariant composite operators (so they parametrize the
directions which are d-at with respect to these u(1) symmetries). a possible matrix
q is given by

this provides a symplectic quotient description of the f-at direction of our original
theory (2.10). at this point we should recall that the vevs for the ras in the original
theory were also constrained by d-atness conditions. these constraints can be im-
posed at the level of the p if we can nd an assignment of charges qi for p, such
that it reproduces the charge via of ra under the u(1)i, i = 1, 2, 3 in (2.10)

which are related as xyz = w2. from their expression in terms of the original elds

(2.10), given in parentheses, we note that these variables indeed span the moduli space,

regarded as the space of gauge invariant operators of the eld theory (2.10) modulo

the equations of motion.

we are now ready to consider the partial resolutions that arise when we consider

non-vanishing fi terms. we will not perform an exhaustive exploration of the parame-

ter space, but rather present one example of each possible blow-up. this will illustrate

the type of argument we will need for our future purposes.

i) let us consider a single blow-up of this space. this can be done by turning on
one fi term, so we consider 1  0, 2 = 3 = 0. a solution to the d-term equations
for the charge matrix (2.20) is provided by |p6|2 = |p7|2 = |p9|2 = 1. these vevs break
three of the u(1) gauge symmetries. the elds p6, p7, p9 disappear, and the remaining
elds p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p8 can still take vevs which are constrained only by the d-terms

the toric diagram, shown in gure 2b, is known to describe the suspended pinch point

singularity. we can see this directly, by noticing that, modulo constant coecients,

the variables (2.22) read

x = p1p2

2p3p8 , y = p1p3p4p2

5 , z = p4p8 , w = p1p2p3p4p5p8

(2.24)

however, there exists a new variable w = p2p2p3p5, invariant under all the surviving
u(1)s. notice that w = wz, so w parametrizes a blown-up ip1. in terms of the basic
invariants x, y, z, w, the blown-up space is described by xy = zw2.

before continuing with further blow-ups, we would like to identify the above vev in

terms of the original elds (2.10). recalling the relations (2.16), we see that a vev for

p6, p7, p9 corresponds to a vev for the eld z14.

ii) let us perform a further blow up, by allowing a non-vanishing 3. thus we
consider 1  0, 3  0, 2 = 0. the d-term equations are solved by |p3|2 = |p5|2 = 3,
|p6|2 = 1 + 3, |p7|2 = |p9|2 = 1. the remaining elds p1, p2, p4, p8 have the following
charge matrix and toric data

(2.25)

the toric diagram is shown in gure 2c, and corresponds to the conifold singularity.

this can be seen from the invariant variables (2.24), which after the higgsing read

x = p1p2

2p8 , y = p1p4 , z = p4p8 , w = p1p2

(2.26)

there is a new invariant, x = p2p8, such that x = xw. the remaining singularity is
xy = zw, a conifold. using (2.16) we see that the blow-up from c3/(z2  z2) to the
conifold corresponds to a vev for the elds z14, y34.

iii) for completeness, let us also discuss the blow-up of the spp to the z2 orbifold
singularity. in order to do that, we consider 1  0, 2  0, 3  0, 3 + 2 = 0. the
constraints are solved by the vevs |p6|2 = |p7|2 = 1  2, |p8|2 = 2, |p9|2 = 1. the

(2.27)

the toric diagram is depicted in gure 2d. the blown-up space corresponds to c2/z2
c, as can be seen by looking at the invariant variables (2.24), which now read

x = p1p2

2p3 , y = p1p3p2

5 , z = p4 , w = p1p2p3p5

(2.28)

5 = y/z. the remaining singularity is xy = w2.
the new invariant is y = p1p3p2
finally, let us mention that the blow-up from c3/(z2  z2) to the z2 orbifold can be
seen from (2.16) to correspond to vevs for z14, z32.

this concludes our review of the toric description of c3/(z2  z2) and its blow-
ups, so we turn to the construction of the eld theories obtained after following the

higgs branches we have just mentioned.

in what follows we go back to the case of

more general ranks for the gauge groups in (2.10), and moreover take into account

the freezing of the u(1) factors. thus the higgs breakings are interpreted as baryonic

branches.

2.2.2 back to the eld theories

now we are in good shape to interpret the blowing-ups of c3/(z2  z2) from the
eld theory viewpoint. this allows us to construct the eld theories at non-orbifold

singularities.

i) let us construct the eld theory of d3-branes at the spp singularity xy = zw2.
as determined above, it is obtained from (2.10) by turning on a suitable blow-up
mode, which corresponds to giving a diagonal vev to z14. this at direction exists

12

i n1 = n4 (subsequently denoted by n) and implies the breaking to the diagonal
subgroup su(n)1  su(n)4  su(n)(14). the eld z14 is swallowed by the higgs
mechanism, and the superpotential (2.11) makes the elds x31, y43, x42, y21 massive.
the surviving light elds are

su (n)(14) su (n2) su (n3)

y12
x24
z23
z32
y34
x13
z41

adj.

(2.29)

integrating out the massive elds using their equations of motion, we obtain the

superpotential

w = tr (x24y12z23z32  z32z23y34z13 + x13y34z41  x24z41y12)
this eld theory agrees with (2.3), (2.4) by an obvious relabeling of elds.

(2.30)

ii) the spp singularity can be further blown-up to a conifold. this allows to
construct the eld theory of d3-branes at the conifold by taking a baryonic branch
from the theory above. as studied before, the suitable higgsing is achieved by giving
a diagonal vev to y34. this vev is possible when n = n3, and triggers the breaking of
su(n)(14)  su(n)3  su(n)(134). the eld y34 is swallowed, and x13, z41 become
massive. the remaining light elds are

su (n)(134) su (n2)

y12, z32
x24, z23

integrating out the massive elds, the superpotential is

w = tr (y12z23z32x24  y12x24z32z23)

(2.31)

(2.32)

this eld theory agrees with (2.1), (2.2). notice that the higgsing we have just dis-

cussed has a nice interpretation in the iia picture, where it corresponds to removing
one ns brane from the conguration in gure 1b to recover gure 1a.

iii) for completeness, we also discuss the eld theory interpretation of the blow-up
of the spp to the z2 orbifold. as discussed above, it corresponds to higgsing the eld
theory (2.29), (2.30) with a diagonal vev for z32. this is possible when n2 = n3 (denoted

13

by m in what follows), and triggers the breaking su(m)2su(m)3  su(m)(23). the
eld z32 disappears, but no eld becomes massive. the surviving light elds are

su (n)(14) su (m)(23)

y12, x13
x24, y34

z41
z23

adj.

adj.

(2.33)

and their superpotential is

w = tr (x13y34z41  x24z41y12 + y12z23x24  y34x13z23)

(2.34)

which agrees with the eld theory of d3-branes at a z2 singularity [5]. this higgs

breaking can be interpreted in the iia side as the removal of the ns-brane from the

conguration shown in gure 1b.

3 introduction of orientifold planes in the iia side

in this section we start the study of orientifolded models by describing the dierent iia
brane congurations that can be obtained introducing o6-planes or o6-planes in the
n = 1 elliptic models described in section 1. the type iia construction of more general
models is straightforward [9, 25]. however, the computation of the corresponding type

iib t-duals would be extremely involved, so we restrict to the simplest examples.

3.1 models with one ns-brane and two ns-branes

let us rst consider the iia conguration with one ns-brane and two ns-branes. the
dierent brane congurations that arise when we introduce o6-planes (along 0123789)
are shown in figure 3. the two ns-branes are necessarily related to each other by the
orientifold projection, while the ns-brane is mapped to itself and is therefore stuck at
one of the o6-planes. as usual, dierent eld theories arise from the dierent choices
of the o6-plane charges. the matter content and interactions are obtained using the
rules in [36, 17]. for instance, the conguration with two negatively charged o6-planes
gives the following eld theory content

there is a superpotential given by

w = a0q q  qqa1 a1

(3.2)

the eld theory for the remaining cases is obtained by obvious replacements of

antisymmetric representations by symmetric ones, and/or symplectic gauge factors by

orthogonal factors. all these theories are non-chiral.

another possibility is to introduce o6-planes, as illustrated in gure 4. as before,
the two ns-branes are mapped to each other under the orientifold projection, while
the ns-brane is invariant. however, in this case the ns-brane divides the o6-plane in
two halves, which must have dierent rr charge [37]. the model requires eight half
d6-brane to conserve rr charge, and yields a chiral spectrum. we refer to this sector
as the fork conguration[15, 16, 17]. there are two possible eld theories, which dier
in the choice of orientifold charge. the eld theory corresponding to the conguration
with one fork and one o6  has the following gauge group and matter content

along 89 (but not 7).

the eld theory for the conguration with the o6 +-plane has a similar structure.

3.2 models with one ns-brane and one ns-brane

let us turn to the iia congurations with one ns-brane and one ns-brane. in this
case the most obvious possibility is that each vebrane is mapped to itself, so each is
stuck at one orientifold plane. the theories obtained by introducing o6-planes and
o6-planes are equivalent, and for concreteness we discuss the conguration with o6-
planes, depicted in gure 5. one of the o6-planes is split in halves by the ns-brane, so
the conguration contains one fork. there are two eld theories, depending on the sign
of the o6-plane intersected by the ns-brane. choosing for instance the conguration
in gure 5b, the resulting eld theory is

a less obvious conguration is possible, in which we consider ns-vebranes rotated
450 in the 45-89 plane. in such case, an o6-plane can map the vebranes to one
another, so they must be located at z2 symmetric positions in x6 (note that the

conguration with o6-planes provides an equivalent model). we will not consider this

case in the present paper.

in it. the only point to keep in mind is that a ns-brane does not split an o6-plane in two

halves.

4 t-dual models i: orientifolds of xy = zw2

our aim in the rest of the paper is to construct the type iib t-duals of these con-

gurations. they are expected to be given by suitable orientifolds of the singularities
xy = zw2 and xy = zw. however, it is not obvious how to check this directly. even

though the t-duality allows to guess the action of the orientifold projection on these

spaces, the usual techniques to compute the spectrum and to check the cancellation of

tadpoles are not valid for non-orbifold spaces. in this section we show how these di-

culties can be overcome, using an indirect approach based on the techniques reviewed

in section 2.2.

more concretely, we will construct congurations of d3-branes at orientifolds of
c3/(z2  z2), and perform partial resolutions of the singular geometry to obtain
orientifolds of the spp and conifold singularities. as in section 2.2, these blow-ups

correspond to baryonic branches in the d3-brane eld theory. since the orientifold

models are obtained by imposing z2 identications on the elds in the orbifold the-

ory, any baryonic branch in the orientifold can be regarded as inherited from baryonic

branches in the orbifold model. hence the the map between blow-up modes and bary-

onic higgsings we found in section 2.2 will be useful for our analysis. the reverse

implication, though, does not work, and certain blow-ups in the orbifold case may be

absent, frozen, in the orientifold models. we will nd an example of this in section 5.

4.1 some orientifolds of c3/(z2  z2)
in this section we construct several orientifolds of c3/(z2  z2), explicitly checking
their consistency (algebraic consistency and cancellation of tadpoles), and computing

17

the eld theories arising on d3-brane probes. the list below is not intended to be

a complete classication of such models. rather, it provides us with a rich enough

starting point for recovering, upon blowing-up, the eld theories obtained in section

3.1 from the iia perspective. since the computations of orientifold spectra are rather

standard, we leave most of the details out of the discussion, and merely describe the

models. cancellation of tadpoles is discussed in more detail in appendix a. we consider

four dierent models, referred to as a1, a2, b and c.

models a

we consider the following structure for the orientifold group

(1 +  +  + )(1 + )

(4.1)

where  = (1)flr1r2r3. we also take the d3-brane chan-paton matrices

,3 = diag (i1n1, i1n2,i1n2,i1n1)
,3 = diag (i1n1,i1n2, i1n2,i1n1)

or ,3 =

(4.2)









where the choice of  denes the choice of so or sp projection on the d3-branes.
we refer to these models as a1 and a2, respectively. the spectra obtained from

the orientifold projections are provided below, in eqs. (4.9), (4.10). as discussed in

appendix a, this model is consistent without the addition of d7-branes.

model b

further models can be obtained by changing the orientifold group. let us consider

(1 +  +  + )(1 + )

(4.3)

where  : (z1, z2, z3)  (iz1,iz2, z3), that is 2 = . a suitable chan-paton embed-
ding is dened by

,3 = diag (i1n1, i1n2,i1n2,i1n1)
,3 = diag (i1n1,i1n2, i1n2,i1n1)

,3 =

1n2

1n2

in1

(4.4)





in this case, the matrix ,3 is rather unique, and we obtain only one eld theory. its
spectrum is given below, in eqs. (4.9), (4.10). as shown in appendix, this models does

not require d7-branes for consistency.

18

model c

our last model is constructed using the orientifold group

(1 +  +  + )(1 + )

(4.5)

where  : (z1, z2, z3)  (iz1, z2,iz3), that is 2 = ). our choice of chan-paton
matrices is

,3 = diag (i1n1, i1n2,i1n2,i1n1)
,3 = diag (i1n1,i1n2, i1n2,i1n1)

this model contain non-vanishing klein bottle tadpoles. as shown in appendix a they

can be cancelled by introducing a set of d73 branes with chan-paton factors:

the model c has additional elds coming from the 3-73 sector. for the minimal choice
of chan-paton matrices satisfying (4.8), m2 = m3 = 8, m1 = m4 = 0, we have eight
elds t a

of su(n2). the global so(8)2 global symmetry acting on these avours is realized on
the world-volume of the corresponding d7-branes. the model c is the only chiral one.

1 in the anti-fundamental of su(n1) and eight elds u a

comparing the spectra above with the orbifold spectrum (2.10), we see the eect
of the orientifold projection is to identify the groups su(n1)  su(n4) (in such a way

the models a1, a2, b, c dier in the introduction of dierent signs in this identica-

tions. these are particularly important, since they determine the symmetry of the two-

index tensor representations (4.10). however, the relation above contains the relevant

information for many purposes. for instance, the basic structure of the superpoten-

tial in the orientifold models is obtained from (2.11) upon imposing the identication

above.

in the following section we study the dierent resolutions of these orientifolds. since

the computations are familiar from the orbifold case, we discuss the details only for

the most interesting case, the chiral theory, model c. its superpotential is

w = tr [ x t

21 + z14uu + z23t t ] (4.12)

for future convenience, we also list in the following table the action of the orientifold
projection on c3/(z2  z2), when described as xyz = w2 in terms of the invariant
variables x = z2

(4.13)

we end this section with a toric comment. using (2.16), the relations (4.11) show

that the orientifold action can be implemented at the level of the ps of section 2.2.1
as the z2 identication

p1  p3

(4.14)

in fact, the relation above does not encode the dierences between the models a, b,

c. this could be easily accomplished by using matrix-valued elds p, but we will not

20

need this renement. for future convenience, we note that, given the action of the

orientifold on the gauge groups of the orbifold theory (see comment preceding (4.11)),
it also imposes the following relation 6 on the fi terms of section 2.2.1

1 = 4 , 2 = 3

(4.15)

i=1 i is the fi for the last u(1)4.

where 4 = p3
4.2 orientifolds of xy = zw2

in this section we perform a single blow-up in the orientifolds of c3/(z2  z2) con-
structed in the previous section, in order to reproduce orientifolds of the suspended
pinch point singularity, xy = zw2. we show that d3-brane probing the dierent ori-

entifolds of this singularity realize the dierent eld theories constructed in section 3.1
from the type iia viewpoint, as orientifolded n = 1 elliptic models. as in [21], these
constructions illustrate how several exotic brane dynamics eects on the iia side have

a quite standard realization in the type iib t-dual setup.

the rst observation is that, in order to obtain orientifolds of the spp variety, the

required blow-up must correspond to a vev for one of the elds zij, rather than to the
elds xij or yij. this follows from the fact that a vev for one of the latter elds in the
orientifold model can be thought to arise from a vev for two elds, related by (4.11), in

the orbifold theory. the analysis in section 2.2.1 shows that the associated blow-ups
resolve c3/(z2  z2) to the z2 orbifold. orientifolds of xy = xw2 are therefore only
obtained by following baryonic branches associated to the elds zij, invariant under
(4.11). let us discuss the models obtained starting with the chiral c3/(z2  z2)
orientifold, model c.

consider giving a vev to the symmetric representation z14. from our experience in
section 2.2, we know this corresponds to blowing-up by introducing a ip1 parametrized
by w = w/z, so the resulting space is an orientifold of xy = zw2. for readers

acquainted with the toric derivation, this is shown exactly as in section 2.2.1: a vev

for z14 corresponds to vevs for p6, p7, p9, a possibility which is consistent with the
symmetry (4.14). this vevs are forced in the region of fi space given by 1  0,
2 = 3 = 0, which is consistent with (4.15). the variables invariant under the unbroken
symmetries are as in (2.24), x = p1p2
5, z = p4p8, w = p1p2p3p5 =
w/z, satisfying the relation above.

2p3p8, y = p1p3p4p2

6the relation below can also be obtained by imposing the conditions that (4.14) is a symmetry of

the charge matrix q (2.20).

21

the nal model is an orientifold of type iib string theory on xy = zw2 by
(1)flr, with r a geometric z2 transformation inherited from the action (4.13)
of the orientifold on c3/(z2  z2). we have

r :

x  x , y  y , z  z , w  w.

(4.16)

this orientifold preserves n = 1 supersymmetry on the d3-branes.

let us consider the eect of this blow-up in the eld theory. the vev for z14 forces
the breaking su(n1)  so(n1). the eld z14 is swallowed in the process, and the
superpotential (4.12) makes x31, y21 and u a massive. the remaining light elds are

this eld theory agrees with that arising from the iia conguration in gure 4a.

indeed this is supported by some information from the t-duality argument. the t-
duality between a iia models with two ns-branes and one ns-brane to the singularity
xy = zw2 maps the coordinates 45, 89 to w, z. therefore, the orientifold symmetry
imposed by the o6-planes (reecting 89, but not 45) t-dualizes to z  z, w  w,
indeed contained in (4.16).

there is another inequivalent higgsing that can be performed in the model c, given

by a vev for one of the antisymmetric representations, say z41. geometrically, this
corresponds again to a blow-up w = w/z, leading again to an orientifold of xy = zw2
by (1)flr, with r as above (4.16). the derivation of this result is dierent, though.
in the language of section 2.2.1, the blow up induced by the vev for z41 correspond to
vevs for p4, p7, p8 (consistent with (4.14)). this is achieved in the region of fi terms
1  0, 2 = 3 = 0 (consistent with (4.15)). the invariant variables (2.22) become
x = p1p2
5p6, z = p6p9, and w = p1p2p3p5p6p9, and the new invariant is
w = p1p2p3p5 = w/z. they satisfy the relation above.

2p3p9, y = p1p3p2

given this underlying dierence, the eld theory on the d3-branes along this bary-
onic branch diers from (4.17). the group su(n1) breaks to usp(n1), z41 is swallowed,

(4.20)

the spectrum suggests the model provides the t-dual of the iia brane conguration

in gure 4b. in fact, the orientifold action on the iia picture agrees, via t-duality,

with the action on the iib side. however the spectrum (4.19) has additional states

as compared with (3.3), concretely eight chiral avours of usp(n1). the precise iia
conguration to which this model t-dualizes must contain eight (whole) d6-branes
between the ns-branes. notice how the coupling between these avours and the

adjoint of usp(n1) in (4.20) is indeed present in the iia picture.

there are two important lessons to learn from this example. the rst is that our

method has a small caveat. even though it yields completely consistent orientifolds of

non-orbifold spaces, there is no guarantee that it yields the simplest model for a given
orientifold action. in the case above, the iia picture does not require these d6-branes

for consistency, and so suggests that the iib d7-branes responsible for the appearance

of the avours u are not required in the orientifold of the spp singularity. however,

we know they were actually required for consistency of our starting point, the model

c. the resolution of the puzzle is that in the process of connecting the orientifold of
c3/(z2  z2) to the orientifold of the spp some tadpoles become non-dangerous, the
corresponding rr-ux now being able to escape to innity along the innitely blown-

up ip1. in what follows we will always remove this type of additional states whenever
they appear.

the second lesson is that in some circumstances one d7-brane in the iib side can
map to one whole d6-brane, as in the model above. notice that the eight d6-branes
in the iia picture suer the projection by the whole o6 -plane, and so have a so(8)

symmetry, in agreement with the iib picture.

since the two models constructed, (4.17) and (4.19), are geometrically the same, but
provide dierent eld theories on the probes, we learn that the orientifold (1)flr,

23

with r given by (4.16), allows for two dierent projections (so and sp) on the d3-
branes.

the analysis we have performed can be applied analogously to the remaining z2z2
orientifolds, models a1, a2 and b. the orientifolds of xy = zw2 obtained by the
blowing-up procedure reproduce all the eld theories proposed in section 3.1, which
arise for type iia congurations with two ns-branes and one ns-brane. moreover,
the geometric action of the orientifold projection agrees with the expectations from
directly t-dualizing the orientifold action on the iia models. the results for the
dierent orientifolds are shown in the following table.

further blow-ups

in this section we would like to make some comments on further blow-ups. as

explained above, baryonic branches associated to elds x or y arise from two blow-

ups in the orbifold theory, which become mapped to each other in the orientifolding

process. these can be studied using the toric methods we have described, but their net
eect is to introduce a variable y = y/w2 (or x = x/w2). hence, this type of blow-

up leads to orientifolds of smooth spaces, concretely taub-nut spaces. the precise

24

action of the orientifold on the geometry can be computed as in the examples above.

these blow-ups have a simple interpretation in terms of the t-dual iia picture, they
correspond to the removal of the two parallel ns-branes from the conguration.

the resulting eld theories are not uninteresting. after the higgsing, the iia
congurations in gures 3b, 3c realize the n = 4 usp(n) and so(n) gauge theories,
respectively, as constructed in [38]. in the type iib picture, the transverse space to
the d3-branes, given by the taub-nut xy = z times a complex plane parametrized
by w, is modded out by the orientifold action (1)flr, with r acting as

x  x , y  y

, z  z , w  w

(4.21)

the model in gure 3a (resp. g. 3d) realizes an n = 2 so(n) (resp. usp(n))
gauge theories with one symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) hypermultiplet. the usp(n)

theory, with four additional hypermultiplet avours, has appeared in several papers

[39, 38]. in the t-dual iib picture, the geometric action of the orientifold is

x  x , y  y

, z  z , w  w

(4.22)

the congurations in gure 4 contain a fork even after the higgsing. the models are
however non-chiral, and actually exhibit an enhanced n = 2 supersymmetry. after the
higgsing, the model in gure 4b (resp. gure 4a) realizes a usp(n) (so(n)) theory

with one antisymmetric (symmetric) and four fundamental hypermultiplets.

in the

type iib picture the corresponding orientifold action is

x  x , y  y

, z  z , w  w

(4.23)

the n = 2 models above illustrate examples of eld theories which can be realized in
two dierent iia brane constructions. our analysis shows that their type iib version
also correspond to dierent orientifold projections 7.

a dierent pattern is obtained if we explore blow-ups of the orientifolds of xy = zw 2

associated with vevs for the elds zij. from the type iib perspective, we can use the
techniques of section 2.2.1 to show that the resulting models are always orientifolds of

the z2 orbifold. this can be also understood in the iia setup, since these blow-ups
are realized as the removal along x7 of the only ns-brane in the conguration, leaving
the two parallel ns-branes untouched.

thus, our techniques allow to recover (in a somewhat complicated fashion) some
orientifolds of the c2/z2 orbifold, which can actually be directly constructed, as in [40]

7we thank j. erlich and a. naqvi for raising this question, and for useful discussions on this point.

25

for n = 2 orientifolds, or as in [21] for n = 1 orientifolds. this provides a non-trivial
consistency check for our procedure, by comparing the orientifold actions derived from

the blowing-up technique with the orientifold actions used in the direct construction

of the model. we nd agreement in all the models considered.

let us briey discuss this point in the orientifold of xy = zw2 by (1)flr, with
in this case

r given in (4.16), with the projection leading to the spectrum (4.17).
there are two interesting blow-ups which can be performed. let us rst consider the

baryonic branch corresponding to a vev for z23. it can be seen to correspond to the
blow-up x = x/z, so the resulting space is an orientifold of xy = w 2 by (1)fl
times the action

x  x

, y  y , w  w

, z  z

(4.24)

from the eld theory point of view, the vev for z23 yields a nal (non asymptotically
free) n = 2 theory with gauge group so(n1)  so(n2) with one bifundamental hy-
permultiplet. this eld theory can be directly constructed (in analogy with models

in [40]) on the world-volume of d3-branes at an orientifold obtained by modding out
c3by z2 +3z2. here 3 = (1)flr3 and recall that r3 ips the sign of z3, and that
the generator  of z2 ips the sign of z1, z2. the action of the orientifolding element
3 on the invariant variables x = z2
2, w = z1, z2, z = z3 (satisfying xy = w2) is
exactly (4.24), in agreement with the result from the blowing-up procedure.

1, y = z2

a dierent blow-up would have been achieved if we had given a vev to z32. this
choice can be seen to correspond to the blow-up y = y/z, so the nal orientifold mods
xy = w2 by (1)fl times the action

x  x , y  y , w  w

, z  z

(4.25)

from the eld theory point of view, the vev for z32 give a nal n = 2 theory with group
so(n1)  usp(n2) and one bifundamental and four fundamental
2 hypermultiplets.
this theory can be directly constructed (as in [40]), by modding out d3-branes in at
space by the orientifold group z2 + 3z2, with  : (z1, z2)  (iz1,iz2). the action
of the orientifold element 3z2 on the invariant variables is exactly (4.25). these two
examples illustrate how the indirect construction of orientifolds using the blowing-up

procedure agrees with the direct construction, when the latter is available.

these two blow-ups are interesting for a dierent reason.

in the t-dual brane

picture (gure 4a, they correspond to two dierent deformations of the fork, corre-
sponding to moving the ns-brane towards positive x7 (leaving two positively charged
o6-planes in the conguration) or towards negative x7 (leaving two oppositely charged

26

o6-planes). in the type iib picture these two blow-ups dier by a op transition, as
we show below. this was in fact expected, since the distance in x7 between the ns-
and ns-branes in the iia conguration is mapped to the kahler size of the ip1 in the
iib picture.

we can use the techniques in section 2.2.1 to show that the two blow-ups above
dier by a op transition. the rst one corresponds to the region in fi space 1  0,
3 + 2 = 0, 2  0. notice this choice of fi is consistent with (4.15), so the blow-up
indeed exists in the orientifold model. the d-term equations for the charge matrix
q (2.20) are solved by |p4|2 = 2, |p6|2 = 1, |p7|2 = |p9|2 = 1 + 2 (note that these
vevs are invariant under (4.14)). using (2.16), we see these vevs imply the blow-up is

associated with a vev for z14, z23 in the eld theory. the second blow-up discussed
above corresponds to the region 1  0, 3 + 2 = 0, 2  0. the d-term equations for
the p are satised by the vevs |p6|2 = |p7|2 = 1  2, |p8|2 = 2, |p9|2 = 1, which
imply the blow-up corresponds to vev for z14, z32 in the eld theory. as claimed above,
the only dierence between both resolutions is the change of sign for 2, which signals
a op transition, as studied in [34, 41].

5 t-dual models ii: orientifolds of the conifold

in principle one could try to obtain orientifolds of the conifold by performing blow-
ups in the orientifolds of c3/(z2  z2) constructed in section 4.1. however, after
exhaustive exploration whose details we spare here it is possible to show that this is

not possible. this is due to the constraints (4.15) on the blow-up parameters i, which
forbid precisely this type of resolution. this has a simple explanation using the relation

between the geometric blow-up and the baryonic higgsing in the eld theory. recall
that, before orientifolding, the blow-up of c3/(z2  z2) to the conifold corresponds
to a vev to exactly two elds arising from dierent complex planes (for instance, z14,
y34, as in section 2.2). clearly this type of vev is not invariant under the orientifold
symmetry (4.11), which does not relate elds from dierent complex planes. therefore,

the associated geometric blow-up mode is frozen in the orientifold model. a particular

consequence of this general argument is the fact, encountered in the previous section,

that the orientifolds of the spp singularity cannot be resolved to orientifolds of the

conifold (instead, further blow-ups yield orientifolds of the z2 orbifold).

this problem is rather particular to using c3/(z2  z2) as starting point. in this
section we show the orientifolds of the conifold are in fact recovered as partial blow-ups
of orientifolds of the c3/(z2  z3) orbifold.

27

5.1 the c3/(z2  z3) orbifold and its blow-up to the conifold

let us rst discuss the model before the orientifold projection. the action of the
z2  z3 on c3 that we are considering is actually equivalent to that generated by the
order six element

the moduli space of this theory can be constructed explicitly following the technique

in section 2.2.1. since it does not introduce new conceptual ingredients, we provide
the basic data in the appendix b. following the same arguments as in the z2  z2
case, they can be used to reproduce the geometric results mentioned in our arguments

below.

since the process of blowing up to the conifold is somewhat involved, we proceed
in two steps. first consider the geometric resolution associated to a vev for z63,
z41 (so we are assuming n6 = n3, n1 = n4). from the geometric point of view, it
corresponds to resolving the c3/(z2  z3) orbifold to the singularity xy = zw3, as
shown in appendix b. from the eld theory point of view, the gauge group is broken
to su(n1)  su(n2)  su(n3)  su(n5), and the elds z63, z41 are swallowed. the
superpotential couplings give masses to the elds x12, x34, x56, y24, y35, and a linear
8in contrast with the z2  z2 models, in this case the issue of the u (1) factors is more subtle,
since some of them have non-zero triangle anomalies. these anomalies are, however, cancelled by a

gs mechanism, as shown in [13]. a similar comment applies to the orientifold models below.

where y is the linear combination of y46, y13 which remains massless. the superpo-

the fact that this eld theory appears on the world-volume of d3-branes at the singu-
larity xy = zw3 is also supported by the t-duality mentioned in section 1.1 [9]. the
conguration is mapped to a type iia model containing three ns-branes and one ns-

brane, with d4-branes suspended among them. this conguration, which shown in

gure 6a, allows to easily read o the eld theory and interactions above. the picture

is also helpful since it suggest that the eld theory of the conifold is recovered upon

giving vevs to e.g. x45, x23, since this corresponds to removing two ns-branes from
the picture, recovering gure 1. the eld theory analysis is straightforward, and we
obtain a gauge group su(n1)  su(n2), with the multiplets z52, y transforming in
the ( , ), and the multiplets z25, x61 in the ( , ). the superpotential is

w = tr [z52z25y x61  z52x61y z25]

(5.4)

this eld theory agrees with (2.1) and (2.31). it is also a simple matter to nd the

geometric counterpart of this higgs branch, and nd that it corresponds to blowing up
xy = zw3 to the conifold singularity (see appendix b).

5.2 orientifolds of the conifold

for the antisymmetric ,3 the spectrum and interactions are analogous, and can be
obtained by replacing the antisymmetric representations in (5.6) by symmetric repre-

sentations. we will not discuss the details of this case, and mainly treat the case listed

above. also, since we are interested in baryonic higgs branches which exist only for

n1 = n2 = n3 = n, from now on we assume equal ranks for all gauge factors.

the orientifold above contains non-vanishing tadpoles which must be cancelled.

notice that the inconsistency arising from these tadpoles is manifest since the eld

theory has non-abelian gauge anomalies. the simplest possibility to cancel the tadpoles

(in the case of equal nis)is to add a set of d72-branes with chan-paton matrices

,72 = diag (i14,i14)

;

,72 =  

14

(5.7)

the symmetry of the matrix ,72 is determined by that of ,3. states in the 3-72
sector provide chiral antifundamental multiplets t a
1 , a = 1, . . . , 4 for su(n)1, and chiral
fundamentals t a
3 , a = 1, . . . , 4 for su(n)3. this additional matter precisely cancels the
eld theory anomalies. these elds couple to the 33 sector through the superpotential

w = t a

1 y13t a

(5.8)

for completeness, let us mention that for antisymmetric ,3, tadpoles (and anoma-

lies) are cancelled by introducing d71-branes with chan-paton factors

,71 = diag (14,14)

;

,71 =   14

14!

(5.9)

this gives rise to four chiral fundamental avours for su(n1) and four anti-fundamental
avours for su(n3). they couple to the symmetric representations x61 and x34.

in the following we would like to describe the blow-up to the orientifold of the

conifold. in order to interpret geometrically the higgsing involved, it will be useful to

list here the action of the orientifold symmetry on the elds (5.2) of the orbifold theory

the action on the orbifold space, when described as xy2z3 = w6, is

x  x , y  y , z  z , w  w

(5.10)

(5.11)

finally, it is important for the geometric computations to recall the constraints imposed

on the blow-up parameters i, which appear as fi terms or vevs for baryonic operators

31

in the eld theory

1 = 6 , 2 = 5 , 3 = 4.

(5.12)

let us turn to describing the blowing-up process. consider a vev for the eld z41.
its geometric interpretation is straightforward by regarding it as giving identical vevs

to the elds z41, z63 in the orbifold theory, a process which we studied above. this
shows that this blow-up will resolve the orientifold of c3/(z2  z3) to an orientifold
of xy = zw3. following the action (5.11) through the blowing-up up process, the nal
orientifold acts on xy = zw3 as

x  x , y  y , z  z , w  w

(5.13)

from the eld theory point of view, the eect of the higgsing triggered by this resolution
is to break the gauge group to su(n)1  su(n)2. the elds x12, y24, x34 and the
antisymmetric part of y13 become massive. the remaining light elds are

(5.15)

this eld theory is realized by a type iia conguration shown in gure 6b. it can be
obtained by introducing o6-planes in gure 6a. using the antisymmetric version of

,3, one can recover the iia conguration in gure 6c in complete analogy.

before proceeding any further, we would like to comment on an interesting point,

concerning the origin of the eight fundamental avours in the nal eld theory. recall
they arise from the eight half d6-branes in the iia side. on the type iib model cor-

responding to symmetric ,3, however, these avour arise from just four d72 branes.
the matrices (5.7) dene four d72-branes and their mirror images, leading to a su(4)
gauge symmetry (global symmetry of the superpotential (5.8)). this seems not to agree

32

with previous statements identifying one whole iib d7-brane with one half iia d6-

brane [22, 21]. also, this structure of iib d7-branes is rather dierent with the one we

had proposed in section 4 as the t-dual of the fork conguration. however, a careful

analysis of the geometry of the blow-up shows there is no contradiction. concretely,
the d72-branes in the initial model span the direction x in xy2z3 = w6. as shown
in the appendix b, the blowing-up process implies the introduction of a new variable
x related to x by x = x2z, which is a one-to-two map. consequently each of the
original d7-branes wraps twice the coordinate x, and we end up with eight d7-branes
spanning the direction x of the space xy = zw3. this description is readily seen to

agree with similar geometric realizations of the fork conguration in section 4. this

interpretation is also supported by the fact that for the choice of antisymmetric ,3,
the initial model already contains eight d71-branes. however, since they do not span
the direction x, they do not suer this doubling process, and provide the right number
of t-dual half d6-branes. a related interesting feature of this blowing-up process is
the accidental enhancement of the d7-brane gauge symmetry from su(4) (or so(4)2

in the case of antisymmetric ,3) to so(8). it would be nice to gain some additional
insight into this issue.

the nal blow-up to the orientifold of the conifold corresponds to giving a vev to

x23. notice that it has a natural interpretation in the iia picture, as the removal of
in our geometric description, the
two (z2 related) ns-branes, to recover gure 5b.

eect of such vev is equivalent to the eect of an identical vev for the elds x23 and
x45 in the orbifold model (notice they are related by (5.10). our analysis above implies
that this resolves the orientifold of xy = zw3 to an orientifold of xy = zw. the precise

geometric action on this last space is given by

x  x , y  y , z  z , w  w

(5.16)

from the eld theory point of view, the higgsing implied by the vev above breaks the

gauge group to a single su(n) factor, with the following matter content

x61 :

z52 :

y13 :

z25 :

; t a :

a = 1, . . . , 8

with superpotential

w = tr [x61y13z52z25 ] + y13t t

(5.17)

(5.18)

this indeed reproduces the eld theory (3.5), arising from the iia brane congura-

tion in gure 5b. the alternative projection on d3-branes reproduces the eld theory

33

realized by the conguration in gure 5a. finally, let us mention that the geomet-

ric action (5.16) is also in agreement with expectations from directly t-dualizing the

orientifold action on the iia side.

alternative blow-ups
clearly, many other blow-ups of the initial orientifold of c3/(z2 z3) are possible,
and performing an exhaustive exploration is outside the point of this paper. suce it

to say that in all cases we have found results consistent with our proposals in previous
sections. for instance, the orientifold of xy = zw3 constructed above (with spectrum

(5.14)) can be blown up an orientifold of the spp. more concretely, there are two

inequivalent ways to perform such a blow-up, diering by a op transition. the result-
ing models correspond to introducing a new ip1 parametrized by either y = y/w or
x = x/w. the two resulting models correspond to modding out the space xy = zw2
by (1)fl times the geometric actions

x  x , y  y , z  z , w  w

(5.19)

these blow-ups correspond to vevs for x61 (for upper signs) or y13 (for lower signs).
it is straightforward to obtain the eld theories after the higgsing. in fact, notice that

this higgsings correspond to removing the ns-brane stuck at the fork in gure 6b.

the resulting brane congurations are, respectively, given in gures 3d and 3c (up to

an irrelevant relabeling of primed and unprimed objects), so the spectrum of the nal

theories can be read o from them. the geometric action (5.19) is in perfect agreement

with the t-duality with these iia congurations, as can be checked using the actions

we had proposed in section 4.2.

a dierent possibility is to blow-up the orientifold of c3/(z2  z3) to an n = 1
orientifold of c3/z3. the direct construction of the latter in [21] provides a new

non-trivial check of our procedure. again, we nd agreement between the orientifolds

arising after the blow-up, the spectra resulting after the corresponding higgsing, and

the t-dual iia brane congurations.

6 final comments

here we would like to make some comments on the more general case of type iia
brane congurations with k ns-branes, k ns-branes, d4-branes and o6-planes. the

possible models can be easily classied in several families, depending on the parity of
the numbers k, k, and the location of the ns vebranes with respect to the o6-planes.

34

within each family, there are dierent eld theories depending on the ordering of the
ns- and ns-branes in the direction 6.

the type iib t-dual congurations correspond to a set of d3-branes sitting at
an orientifold of xy = zkwk, with orientifold action (1)fl times a geometric z2
symmetry. it is a simple matter to propose suitable z2 geometric actions corresponding

to the dierent type iia models. the results are shown in table 1. the geometric

action of the iib orientifold on z, w follows easily by t-dualizing the action of the

iia orientifold on 89, 45 respectively. the action on x, y can be determined from

other requirements (the action must be a symmetry of the singularity, the holomorphic

3-form must be odd under it), and consistency with known results (the orientifolds of

the conifold and suspended pinch point studied in this paper, as well as the limiting

cases where the singularity is actually an orbifold of at space. thus, when k = 0
the t-duals proposed in the table agree with those found in [40], while for k = 0 the

t-duals agree with those proposed in [21]).

the geometric actions in table 1, however, do not completely dene the iib ori-

entifold. in fact, we see that dierent type iia congurations may correspond to the

same geometric action. as we know from our experience, some of the orientifolds allow

for two possible projections (so and sp) on the d3-branes chan-paton factors. this

is not a priori obvious from the type iib side unless one has a more explicit denition

of the orientifold. our procedure of blowing up orientifolds of orbifolds to obtain ori-

entifolds of non-orbifold singularities precisely amounts to such a denition, and this

allowed us to claim the existence of these two projections in some models of section

4.2. in the general case, t-duality predicts the existence of such choice in the orien-

tifolds marked with an asterisk in table 1. this choice should distinguish the t-dual

iib orientifolds of the two iia congurations shown in the second column.

another subtle point concerning the precise denition of the iib orientifold is the

action on the closed string modes localized at the singularity (the analogs of the twisted

modes in the orbifold case).

in particular, some non-orbifold singularities seem to

have the analog of z2 twisted sectors, in that the orientifold maps these modes to

themselves. in the orientifolds of orbifold singularities it is known that there are two

possible projections for these sectors [44]. the orientifold of non-orbifold spaces at

hand show a similar feature. this choice should distinguish the iib orientifolds with

identical geometric action, but whose claimed t-dual iia congurations dier by the
location of vebranes with respect to the o6 planes.

let us mention some further evidence supporting the existence of the mentioned

choices in the denition of these orientifolds. in order to do that, notice that any iia

table 1: the rst column of the table shows the type iib orientifolds t-dual to the type iia

brane congurations shown in the second. the objects in the iia side are listed as ordered
in the coordinates x6. objects enclosed in parentheses are located at the same x6 position.
ns( ) denotes a ns- or a ns-brane. notice that we have not allowed for congurations with

coincident vebranes, since their eld theory interpretation is unclear.

conguration in table 1 without ns-branes stuck at the o6-planes can be deformed
by rotating the ns-branes in 45-89 in a way consistent with the orientifold projection.
such models can be thus rotated to models with only ns-branes, d4-branes and o6
branes, and no ns-branes. the t-duals of these models are d3-branes at n = 1
orientifolds of c2/zk+k orbifolds [21].
in fact, the whole rotation process can be
followed in the type iib t-dual picture: for generic rotation angles, the t-dual is given

36

by an orientifold of xy = zkqk/2
i=1 (z  iw)(z + iw), which interpolates between the
space xy = zkwk (for i = ) and the orbifold xy = zk+k (for i = 0). these
orientifolds of c2/zn orbifolds have been constructed in [21], where it was shown

that the dierent choices in the denition of the iib orientifold action reproduce the

dierent possible iia congurations. table 1 suggests that this feature is preserved
along the deformation from the orbifold space to xy = zkwk.

analogously, models without ns-branes stuck at o6-planes can be rotated to mod-
els without ns-branes. the t-duals of these models are the n = 2 orientifolds of
c2/zn constructed in [40]. the only models which cannot be rotated to more familiar
congurations are those with stuck ns- and ns-branes, i.e. the case of odd k, k.

there is a last comment we would like to make concerning this process of brane

rotation. given that it allows to relate orientifolds of these non-orbifold spaces to

well-known orientifolds of orbifold spaces, it might be possible to use it to provide a

precise denition, and a computational tool to analyze the former. this would allow

the analysis of large families of such iib orientifolds with little eort. in fact this is the

situation suggested by the t-duality with iia congurations: many properties of the

rotated model are related to properties of the unrotated one. however, from the iib

perspective there are several diculties in carrying out this proposal. for instance, it is

not clear how the eect of the deformation of the orbifold appears in the eld theory of

the d3-brane probes. the naive proposal is that some adjoint matter becomes massive

and should be integrating out, leaving an eective theory corresponding to the eld

theory of d3-branes in the deformed space. however reasonable this may seem, in
most cases this procedure does not give the correct answer 9. thus, until a better

understanding of the eld theory manifestation of such deformations is achieved, the

rotation procedure cannot be claimed to be a good tool to analyze the non-orbifold

spaces.

we hope the examples we have worked out illustrate the basic features of the t-
duality for iia congurations with ns- and ns-branes. we also expect these results

to nd applications in other contexts, like for instance the construction of orientifolds

of compact calabi-yau varieties. clearly many directions remain to be explored.

9this is true even without orientifold projections, the simplest example being the deformation of
the c2/z3 orbifold to xy = zw2. the procedure of integrating out the massive adjoints gives the
right matter content, but an incorrect superpotential. this fact has been known to i. klebanov and

e. lopez for some time, and we are grateful to them for discussion on this point.

a appendix: tadpole calculation of z2  z2 orien-

tifold

consider the orientifold projection

(1 +  +  + )(1 + )

(a.1)

with the convention of (4.5). this is the orientifold action of models b and c. in

order to obtain the convention of the model b adopted in the main text, we have to

replace  by  and interchange  with  in the following formulae. we can calculate
the tadpole starting from the compact t 6/(z2  z2) orientifold and then taking the
non-compact limit. in this limit, we can ignore the untwisted tadpole and the twisted

1

sector tadpole inversely proportional to one of the volume factors of the three tori.
4 sin2(2bi) factor in the non-compact limit if an orientifold action
typically we acquire
is non-trivial on the ith torus, zi  e2ibizi. this comes from the momentum modes
along the ith torus, which become continuous in the innite volume limit[45]. one
subtlety of z2  z2 is that this factor can diverge if corresponding orientifold action
acts trivially on the ith plane. this means that the twisted tadpole of our interest is
proportional to the volume vi of the ith torus, diverging in the non-compact limit. such
tadpoles should vanish in a consistent conguration. in general, one must consider only

the twisted tadpoles proportional to vi and tadpoles independent of any vi. hence,
in the z2  z2 case, we should consider the tadpoles proportional to v1, v2 and v3,
and the tadpoles of order 1 with no volume dependence. we turn to each case in the

following.

i) tadpole proportional to v2
this comes from the subset of the orientifold action

(1 + )(1 + )

(a.2)

if we ignore the untwisted tadpole from the cylinder amplitude of d71, d73-branes.
however we should keep all the klein-bottle and mobius amplitude since all of them

have the same volume dependence v2. the amplitude is calculated in the usual manner
following[45] and the result is

kb :

64  64 ()
64  64 ()

,7it

,7i)  16tr (1

,7i)

c :

(tr ,71  tr ,73)2.

(a.3)

39

on each column of the klein bottle amplitude, the rst 64 comes from the untwisted

sector and the second 64 comes from the -twisted sector. for model c, we choose

+ sign for the twisted sector contribution. in order to have factorization, one must

require

tr (1

,7it

,7i) = tr (1

,7it

,7i) = tr ,7i

with + sign for d71 branes and  sign for d73. thus we have

 tr ,71 + tr ,73 + 16 = 0.

(a.4)

(a.5)

for model b, we choose the  sign for the twisted sector contribution in the klein
bottle amplitude and use

tr (1

,7it

,7i) = tr (1

,7it

,7i)

(a.6)

with i = 1, 3 to make mobius amplitude vanishing. the only remaining piece is the

cylinder amplitude, whose cancellation imposes

 tr ,71 + tr ,73 = 0.

(a.7)

now we turn to the other tadpoles. the following analysis holds true both for

model b and model c.

ii) tadpoles proportional to v1
only cylinder amplitude contributes and we have

tr ,72  tr ,73 = 0.

iii) tadpoles proportional to v3
only cylinder amplitude of d71, d72 contributes. we have

tr ,71  tr ,72 = 0.

iv) tadpoles of order 1

(a.8)

(a.9)

only the klein bottle and mobius amplitudes contribute. for klein bottle, we
evaluate the  and  twisted amplitudes with insertions of , , , .
if the action of a twist acting along with  is denoted zi  e2ibizi, the amplitude
for the  twisted sector is proportional to sin 2b2 sin 2b3. since sin 2b2 = 0 for
all the orientifold action to be considered in c3/(z2  z2), klein-bottle amplitude
vanishes for  twisted sector. for  twisted sector the amplitude is proportional to

sin 2b1 sin 2b2, and vanishes for the same reason.

for the mobius amplitude, we evaluate ,  for d71, d73 branes and , 

for d72 branes. if we t-dualize along z1, z2 plane for d73, along z2, z3 plane for d71

40

and t-dualize along z1, z3 planes for d72, we end up with ,  for d3-branes.
denoting by  the twist zi  e2ivizi that accompanies  in these amplitudes, the
mobius amplitude  for d3 brane is proportional to

y sign(2vi) cos vi

(a.10)

in order to obtain the answer for d71, d73, we put back the zero mode (continuos
momemtum mode) contribution in the z1, z2 planes and z2, z3 planes, respectively.
the amplitude is proportional to

with i = 1, 3. the amplitude vanishes if

tr (1

,7i) = tr (1

,7it

,7i) i = 1, 3.

similarly, we obtain for d72 branes

tr (1

,72t

,72) = tr (1

,72t

,72).

(a.11)

(a.12)

(a.13)

the tadpole cancellation conditions for models b and c are collected in expression

(a.18) for convenience of the reader.

for model a, the only twisted tadpoles generated by the klein bottle amplitude

are inversely proportional to one of the volume factor vi or, proportional to vi but with
vanishing coecient. this comes from the fermionic zero mode factor sin 2b1 sin 2b2
for  twisted sector and similar factors for the others. the mobius amplitude also
vanishes, as we presently explain. if we consider d73 branes, we should evaluate ,
, . this is proportional to

(y sign(sin 2vi)) sin v1 sin v2 cos v3

(a.14)

where vi denes the twist acting along with . using the twists appearing in the model,
these amplitudes all vanish. similar reason holds for d71- and d72-branes.

finally, the cylinder amplitudes give the condition

(a.15)

tr ,71  tr ,72 = 0
tr ,72  tr ,73 = 0
tr ,73  tr ,71 = 0

41

to summarize, for model a,b, and c we obtain the following conditions

tr ,71  tr ,72 = 0
(abc)
tr ,72  tr ,73 = 0 (abc)
tr ,73  tr ,71 = 0 (ab)
tr ,73  tr ,71 = 16 (c)

model a and b, the above conditions can be satised without introducing any d7

branes while for model c we can introduce only d73 branes to satisfy the constraints
using the chan-paton matrices appearing (4.7). certainly there are various other

solutions. however, they are dierent from this minimal solution by non-chiral matter

contents.

figure 7: the toric data for the moduli space of the eld theory for d3-branes at the z2z3
singularity.

some interesting blow-ups of this singularity are mentioned in the main text, and

we provide here some details of the computations involved. using equation (b.1), we

see the blow-up associated to a vev for the elds z63, z41 is obtained when the elds
p2, p5, p6, p12, p13, p14, p16 are non-zero. this is achieved in the region of fi space
dened by1 = 4  0, 2 = 5 = 0, 3  0, since the d-terms from the matrix (b.2)
require

|p2|2 = |p6|2 = |p14|2 = 3  1,
the basic invariants under the surviving u(1) symmetries are

|p5|2 = |p16|2 = 3,

|p12|2 = |p13|2 = 1. (b.5)

w = p1p3p4p7p8p10p11p15

(b.6)

comparing with the original invariants (b.3), the blow-up implies the redenition
x = x 2z, w = wz. the remaining singularity is therefore xy = zw3.

an interesting further blow-up is achieved by vevs for the elds x45, x23. using
(b.1) this implies that we only keep p7, p9, p11, p17 as dynamical, while all other
variables get non-zero vev. this vevs can be achieved in the region of fi space dened
by 5 = 1  4, 3  2  0, 4  1  0. the d-term equations associated to

the charge matrix (b.2) are satised for

|p1|2 = |p4|2 = 1 + 4
|p2|2 = |p14|2 = 1  2  3
|p3|2 = |p8|2 = 1 + 2 + 4
|p5|2 = 2  3
|p6|2 = 4  3
the variables (b.6) become

|p10|2 = |p15|2 = 2
|p12|2 = 1
|p13|2 = 4
|p16|2 = 3

x = p7p9 , y = p2

the new invariant is y = p11p17 = y/w2. the remaining singularity is the conifold
xy = zw.

c appendix: tadpoles for the z2  z3 orientifold
as mentioned in the main text, the c3/(z2 z3) orbifold is actually isomorphic to the
z6 orbifold generated by the action on c3 given by zi  e2ivizi with v = (1, 2,3)/6.
the non-compact orientifold studied in section 5.2 belongs to a large family of models,

introduced in [46], whose tadpoles can be computed in a quite general fashion. so let us

consider a general zn orbifold, with n even, and generator dened by v = (1, 2, 3)/n,
with 1, 3 odd and 1 + 2 + 3 = 0. we mod out this space by the orientifold action
 = (1)flr1r2r3. we also choose the chan-paton matrices ,3 (,72) to have nj
(mj) eigenvalues ei(2j1)/n , and ,71 (,73) to have wj (rj) eigenvalues e2ij/n . the
orientifold symmetry imposes nj = nj+1, mj = mj+1, wj = wj, rj = rj.

the gauge group on the d3-branes is qn/2

obtained from the orbifold spectrum

i=1 su(ni). the matter multiplets can be

let us turn to the tadpole computation, which can be obtained from the appendix in

[43]. to simplify the notation, we dene s = sin kv, c = cos kv, s = sin 2kv.
here we will be more sketchy than in appendix a, for instance the volume dependences

are not explicit, though they can be extracted from the appropriate sin kv factors.

with the upper (lower) sign for the so (sp) projection on the d3-branes. we also have

tr n ,3 = 1 , tr n ,72 = 1 , tr n ,71 = 1 , tr n ,73 = 1

using these properties, and after some algebra, the tadpoles can be recast as

with the upper (lower) sign for antisymmetric (symmetric) ,3.

=1 2 sin kvtr k,7+

32k,0 mod 2(sin kv1 sin kv2 sin kv3 + cos kv1 sin kv2 cos kv3) = 0(c.10)
10this follows from the results in [47] for d9- and d5i-branes by a t-dualtiy along the three internal

complex planes.

46

for all k 6= 0. it is a simple exercise to express the chan-paton traces in terms of the
integers ni, mi, wi, ri and show that these conditions are exactly equivalent to the
cancellation of gauge anomalies in the four-dimensional eld theory on the d3-branes,

described above.

for the particular case of v = (1, 2,3)/6, the constraints read
tr ,71 + 3 + tr ,72  2tr ,73  23tr ,3 = 0
tr 2,71 + tr 2,72  8 = 0
tr 3,71 + tr 3,73 = 0
tr 4,71  tr 4,72  8 = 0
tr 5,71  3 + tr 5,72  2tr 5,73 + 23tr 5,3 = 0

which are satised by the models in section 5.2.
