we study the unitary supermultiplets of the n = 4 d = 7 anti-de sitter (ads7) superalgebra
osp(8|4) , with the even subalgebra so(6, 2)  u sp(4), which is the symmetry superalgebra of
m-theory on ads7  s4. we give a complete classication of the positive energy doubleton and
massless supermultiplets of osp(8|4). the ultra-short doubleton supermultiplets do not have a
poincare limit in ads7 and correspond to superconformal eld theories on the boundary of ads7
which can be identied with d = 6 minkowski space. we show that the six dimensional poincare
mass operator m2 = pp  vanishes identically for the doubleton representations. by going from the
compact u (4) basis of so(8) = so(6, 2) to the noncompact basis su (4)d ( d = 6 lorentz group
times dilatations) one can associate the positive (conformal) energy representations of so(8) with
conformal elds transforming covariantly under the lorentz group in d = 6. the oscillator method
used for the construction of the unitary supermultiplets of osp(8|4) can be given a dynamical
realization in terms of chiral super-twistor elds.

1 introduction

recently, a great deal of work has been done on ads/cft (anti-de sitter/conformal eld theory)
dualities in various dimensions. the current interest in ads/cft dualities was sparked by the
conjecture of maldacena [1] relating the large n limits of certain conformal eld theories in d di-
mensions to m-theory/string theory compactied to d+1-dimensional ads spacetimes. maldacenas
conjecture was based on earlier work on properties of the physics of n dp-branes in the near horizon
limit [2] and the much earlier work on 10-d iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5 and 11-d
supergravity compactied on ads7  s4 and ads4  s7[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. maldacenas conjecture
was formulated in a more precise manner in [10, 11]. the relation between maldacenas conjecture
and the dynamics of the singleton and doubleton elds that live on the boundary of ads spacetimes
was reviewed in [12, 13] and its relation to the spectra of maximal supergravities in eleven and ten
dimensions in [13, 14]. for a recent review of ads/cft dualities and an extensive list of references
on the subject see [15].

the best studied example of this ads/cft duality is the duality between the large n limit of
the conformally invariant n = 4 su (n ) super yang-mills theory in d = 4 and type iib superstring
theory on ads5 s5. the n = 4 yang-mills supermultiplet is simply the unique cpt self-conjugate
doubleton supermultiplet of the symmetry superalgebra su (2, 2|4) of type iib superstring over
ads5  s5 [4, 16]. doubleton supermultiplets do not have a smooth poincare limit in d = 5
and correspond to superconformal eld theories on the boundary of ads5, which can be identied
with the four dimensional minkowski space. the su (2, 2|4) algebra acts as the n =4 extended
superconformal algebra on the boundary of ads5. a complete list of doubleton and massless ( in
ads7 sense) supermultiplets of su (2, 2|4) was given in [16, 17]. the cpt self-conjugate massless
supermultiplet of su (2, 2|4) is the massless graviton supermultiplet in d = 5. this massless multiplet
sits at the bottom of an innite tower of massive short supermultiplets of su (2, 2|4) corresponding
to the kaluza-klein spectrum of iib supergravity over s5 [4]. the oscillator construction yields
not only the short multiplets but the massless and massive intermediate and long multiplets as well
[4, 17, 18] .

m-theory compactied on the four sphere s4 is similarly believed to be dual to (2,0) supercon-
formal eld theory in six dimensions ( in a certain limit). the symmetry superalgebra of m-theory
compactied to ads7 over s4 is osp(8|4) [6, 8]. the general method for the oscillator construc-
tion of unitary supermultiplets of osp(8|4)was given in [8] with emphasis on short supermultiplets
that appear in the kaluza-klein compactication of 11 dimensional supergravity theory. the entire
kaluza-klein spectrum of the eleven dimensional supergravity over ads7  s4 can be obtained by
a simple tensoring procedure from the cpt self-conjugate doubleton supermultiplet [8]. this 
cpt self-conjugate doubleton supermultiplet is simply the (2, 0) superconformal multiplet of the
dual eld theory in six dimensions. the ads7/cf t6 duality has been studied from various points
of view more recently [19].

in this paper, we shall give a complete study of the doubleton and massless ( in ads7 sense)
supermultiplets of osp(8|4) which we believe are relevant to the understanding of the full spectrum
of m-theory over ads7  s4. our results extend those of [16, 17] on ads5/cf t4 dualities to
ads7/cf t6 dualities and their relation to the unitary supermultiplets of osp(8|4). in particular,
in section 2, we review the oscillator construction of the positive energy uirs of so(6, 2) and
show how to go from the compact (su (4)  u (1)) basis to the noncompact su (4)  d basis.
considered as the d = 6 conformal group, the su (4)  d subgroup of so(6, 2) can be identied
with d = 6 lorentz transformations times dilatations. we show that doubleton representations of
so(6, 2) are all massless in d = 6. furthermore we show that the uirs of the lowest weight type
constructed by the oscillator method are equivalent to unitary representations of the conformal

1

group induced by a nite dimensional representation of the lorentz group su (4) with a denite
conformal dimension. remarkably, the compact su (4) labelling and the non-compact su (4)
labelling of the uirs coincide. furthermore, the conformal dimension, l, which is given by the
eigenvalues of the dilatation operator, is simply e, where e is the (conformal) energy. thus, the
positive energy uirs with energy e can be identied with d = 6 conformal elds with conformal
dimension l = e.
in section 3, we review the superoscillator construction of the superalgebra
osp(8|4). in section 4, we give a complete list of the doubleton supermultiplets of osp(8|4)which
correspond to massless conformal supermultiplets in d = 6. in section 5, we give a complete list
of massless supermultiplets of osp(8|4)considered as the seven dimensional ads supergroup. the
short massless supermultiplets have spin range 2 in the d = 4 sense, the long massless supermultiplets
have spin range 4 and the intermediate massless supermultiplets have spin ranges between 2 and 4.
we conclude with a discussion of our results as they relate to ads/cft dualities.

2 compact (su (4)  u (1)) versus non-compact (su (4)  d) bases
for the positive energy unitary representations of the group
so(8) = so(6, 2)

the seven dimensional ads group so(8) = so(6, 2) (with the covering group spin(8) = spin(6, 2))
is isomorphic to the six dimensional conformal group (its covering group).4 as the conformal group
in d=6, so(8) is generated by the lorentz group (so(5, 1) with the covering group su (4)) gen-
erators m, the six translation generators p, the dilatation generator d and the generators of
special conformal transformations k (, , . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). the commutation relations of these
generators are

[m , m] = i(m  m  m + m)

[p, m] = i(p  p)
[k, m] = i(k  k)
[d, m ] = [p, p ] = [k, k] = 0
[k, d] = ik

[p, d] = ip;
[p, k ] = 2i( d  m )

(2 - 1)

with  = diag(+, , , , , ). the rotation subgroup so(5) ( or its covering group u sp(4))

is generated by mij with i, j = 1, 2, .., 5.

(p  k), m7 =

2

(p + k), m67 = d,

(2 - 2)

the commutation relations of the d = 6 conformal algebra can be written as

[mab, mcd] = i(bcmad  acmbd  bdmac + admbc),

(2 - 3)

where 66 = 77 = 1 and a, b, .. = 0, 1, ..., 7.

considered as the isometry group of seven dimensional anti-de sitter space, the generators of
so(8) have a dierent physical interpretation. in particular, the rotation group becomes so(6),
with the covering group su (4), generated by mmn (m, n, . . . = 1, 2, .., 6). the generator e  m07
becomes the ads energy generating translations along the timelike killing vector eld of ads7,

4below we shall sometimes denote the covering group by the same symbol as the group itself. unless otherwise

specied we shall however always be dealing with the covering groups in question.

2

and the non-compact generators m0m, mm7 correspond to boosts and spacelike translations in
ads7.

there are two dierent subgroups of the d = 6 conformal group so(6, 2) which play an important
role in the classication of its physically relevant representations. first is the maximal compact
subgroup su (4)u (1)e generated by mmn and e  m07 with the u (1)e generator e = 1
2 (p0 +k0)
being simply the conformal hamiltonian. denoting the lie algebra of su (4)  u (1)e as l0, the
conformal algebra g = so(6, 2) has a three graded decomposition with respect to l0:

g = l+  l0  l,

(2 - 4)

where

[l0, l]  l
[l+, l]  l0
[l+, l+] = 0 = [l, l]
[e, l] = l,

[e, l0] = 0.

(2 - 5)

the general construction of the positive energy unitary representations of so(8) uses the
realization of its generators as bilinears of an arbitrary number p (generations or colors) of pairs
of bosonic annihilation (ai, bi) and creation operators (ai, bi) transforming in the fundamental
representation of su (4) and its conjugate , respectively:[20, 21, 8]

m i
j = ai  aj + bj  bi,
aij = ai  bj  aj  bi,
aij = ai  bj  aj  bi

(2 - 6)

where ai bj =pp

ai(k), bi(k) = bi(k) satisfy the commutation relations:

k=1 ai(k)bj(k) etc.. the bosonic annihilation and creation operators ai(k) =

[ai(k), aj(l)] = j

i kl,

[bi(k), bj (l)] = j

i kl

(2 - 7)

with i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 and k, l = 1, . . . , p . m i

j are the generators of the maximal compact
subgroup u (4). hermitian linear combinations of the aij and aij are the non-compact generators
of so(6, 2). [20, 8]

physically relevant representations of the conformal group are unitary irreducible representations
(uirs) of the lowest weight type in which the spectrum of the conformal hamiltonian (resp. the
ads energy), e, is bounded from below. the natural basis for constructing them is the compact
basis in which the lowest weight (positive energy) property becomes manifest. the lowest weight
uirs of so(6, 2) can then be constructed in a simple way by using the oscillator realization of the
generators given above. each lowest weight uir is uniquely determined by the quantum numbers
of a lowest weight vector, |i, provided that |i transforms irreducibly under su (4)  u (1)e and
is also annihilated by all the elements of l[8].

on the other hand, in d = 6 conformal eld theory, one would like to work with elds that
transform covariantly under the lorentz group, su (4), and the dilatations 5.
in d = 4, the
standard way to construct these elds is via the method of induced representations [23, 17].
in
this method, a representation (typically nite dimensional) of the stability group, h, of x = 0
(where x is the coordinate four vector) induces a representation of the conformal group so(4, 2).
when so(6, 2) acts in the standard way on the (conformal compactication of) 6d minkowski

5 note that the conformal group so(6,2) has a three graded structure with respect to the subgroup su (4)  d

just as it has with respect to its maximal compact subgroup su (4)  u (1) [22]

3

spacetime, the stability group, h, of the coordinate six-vector x = 0 becomes the semi-direct
product (su (4)  d)  k6. furthermore, k6 represents the abelian subgroup generated by the
special conformal generators, k. the lie algebra of h consists of the generators, m , of the
lorentz group, su (4), the dilatation operator, d, and the generators of the special conformal
transformations, k. in our case the d=6 conformal group, g = so(6, 2), will be realized on elds
that live on the coset space, g/h. these elds are labelled by their transformation properties under
the lorentz group, su (4)), their conformal dimension, l, and certain matrices, . in particular,
these matrices, , are related to their behavior under special conformal transformations, k, as in
d = 4 [23, 17].

to establish a dictionary between the compact and non-ompact viewpoints, we shall now re-
formulate the construction of positive energy representations of so(6, 2) [8] in terms of twistorial
operators. the twistorial operators we introduce will involve eight dimensional bosonic spinors.
this is analogous to the twistorial construction in the case of the d = 4 conformal group [17] a
dynamical realization of the twistorial construction of the representations of su (2, 2|4) was given in
[18, 24]. to this end, let  be the 6d gamma matrices ({, } = 2 ) with 7 = i012    5.

generate an eight dimensional (non-unitary) spinor representation of the conformal algebra,
so(6, 2). we shall refer to this representation as the left-handed spinor representation. the
right handed spinor representation is obtained by dening 7 with the opposite sign (i.e. 7 =
+i012    5). unless otherwise specied we shall work with the left-handed spinor representa-
tion below. for our gamma matrices we choose

0 = 3  i2  i2
1 = 1  2  i2
2 = i1  1  2
3 = i1  3  2
4 = i2  i2  2
5 = i2  2  1
7 = i2  2  3

(2 - 8)

where 1, 2 and 3 are the pauli matrices.

we now regroup these bosonic oscillators into left-handed spinorial operators, (k), which we

dene as

4

(k) :=

a1(k)
a2(k)
a3(k)
a4(k)
b1(k)
b2(k)
b3(k)
b4(k),









so that

(k)  (k)0

= (cid:16)a1(k), a2(k), a3(k), a4(k), b1(k), b2(k), b3(k), b4(k)(cid:17) .

consider now the bilinears of these twistorial operators involving the 8  8 matrices (mab) :

(mab) :=

p

xk=1

(k)(mab)(k).

one nds that they satisfy the commutation relations of so(6, 2)

(2 - 10)

(2 - 11)

(2 - 12)

(cid:2) (mab), (mcd)(cid:3) =  [(mab), (mcd)] .

and yield an innite dimensional unitary representation in the fock space of the oscillators ai(k)

and bi(k) .

we have the following relations between the generators realized as bilinears of twistorial opera-

tors and the bilnears given in terms of u (4) covariant oscillators:

1 + m 2

2 + m 3

0 = m 1

2 = a14 + a32 + a14 + a32
03 = a12 + a43 + a21 + a34

04 = i (cid:16)a21 + a43 + a21 + a43(cid:17)

05 = i(cid:16)a41 + a32 + a41 + a32(cid:17)
5 = i (cid:16)a41 + a32 + a14 + a23(cid:17)
07 = i(cid:16)a13 + a42 + a13 + a42(cid:17)
7 = i (cid:16)a13 + a42 + a31 + a24(cid:17) .

(2 - 13)

as stated above, the positive energy uirs of so(6, 2) are easily obtained by constructing an
irreducible representation |i (lowest weight vector) of su (4)  u (1)e in the fock space of the
oscillators that is annihilated by all the operators aij of l subspace:

aij|i = 0.

(2 - 14)

acting repeatedly with the di-creation operators aij of l+ on |i, one generates the basis of
a positive energy uir of the group so(8). to give concrete examples of lowest weight vectors,
consider the case p = 1 (doubletons). in this case the possible lowest weight vectors are of the
form:

|0i

ai1|0i = |

i

ai1ai2|0i = |

i

...

ai1ai2    ain|0i = |

z

n

  

}|

{i.

a(ibj)|0i = |

i

(2 - 15)

(2 - 16)

or of the form

this shows that the possible lowest weight vectors |i of the doubleton uirs of so(8) trans-

form in the symmetric tensor representations of su (4).

the positive energy uirs of so(8) can be identied with conformal elds in d = 6 with
positive conformal energy and a denite conformal dimension transforming covariantly under the
six dimensional lorentz group. to establish this connection we need to nd a mapping from the
su (4)- and d-covariant basis to the compact u (4) basis. for this we dene the following set
of generators jmn (m,n, . . . = 1, . . ., 6) of another compact su (4) basis in terms of the su (4)
generators, m = {mij, mi0} (i,j, . . . = 1, . . ., 5),

jij := mij,
ji6 := imi0 = j6i.

(2 - 17)

the two su (4)s generated by jmn and mmn have as a common subgroup the rotation group

u sp(4) in d = 6. consider now the operator

it has the following important property

u := e

(m06+im67).

jmnu = u (mmn + l),
du = u (ie + l),
ku = u (l),

(2 - 18)

(2 - 19)

where l stands for certain linear combinations of di-annihilation operators aij. specically,

for jmnu = u (mmn + l) we nd,

acting with u on a lowest weight vector |i corresponds to a (complex) rotation in the corre-

sponding representation space of so(8):

u |i = e

(m06+im67)|i.

(2 - 23)

since l|i = 0, it then follows from (2 - 19) that (0) := u |i is an irreducible representation
of the little group h with conformal dimension 6 l = e and trivially represented special conformal
transformations k (i.e.  = 0). acting with eixp on (0) then translates the eld in minkowski
space:

(x) = eixp  (0) = eixpu |i

(2 - 24)

and generates a (group theoretically equivalent) induced representation of so(8) . we should
note that the state (x) can be thought of as a coherent state labelled by  and the coordinate
x.

6in our conventions, l has dimension of length (or inverse mass).

7

since the bosonic oscillators, in terms of which we realized the generators, transform in the
spinor representation of so(8), the oscillator construction can be given a dynamical realization as
was done for su (2, 2) [18, 24].

we recall that the doubleton representations of so(8) correspond to taking a single pair (p = 1)
of bosonic oscillators and they do not have a smooth poincare limit in d = 7. let us now show that
they correspond to massless elds in d = 6 with mass dened in the usual poincare sense,

the translation generators p have the following realization in terms of the oscillators:

m2 = pp .

(2 - 26)

substituting in the above expressions for p one nds after some lengthy calculation the mass
operator m2 vanishes identically for p = 1. thus all the doubleton irreps of so(8) are massless
in d = 6. for p 6= 1 the mass operator is non-vanishing and the lowest weight vectors of so(8)
are in general not eigenstates of the mass operator. hence they correspond to massive conformal
elds in d = 6. we should stress that this is in complete parallel to the situation in d = 4 where
the doubleton representations of so(4, 2) are all massless [25, 17].

3 oscillator construction of the uirs of osp(8|4)

in this section, we give the commutation relations of osp(8|4)
in a non-compact as well as a
compact basis. bearing in mind that it was shown above how to go from the compact basis to a
noncompact basis for the uirs of so(6, 2), we then present a realization of the osp(8|4) gener-
ators in the compact basis in terms of superoscillators. for further details , we refer the reader to
[8, 26].

the symmetry group of m-theory on ads7  s4 is the supergroup osp(8|4)with the even subgroup
so(8)  u sp(4), where u sp(4) is isomorphic to so(5), the isometry group of the four sphere.
osp(8|4) can be interpreted as the n =4 extended ads superalgebra in d = 7 or as the (2, 0)
extended conformal superalgebra in d = 6. because of triality property of the representations
of so(8) and hence of the nite dimensional representations of so(6, 2) there exist three dierent
forms of the superalgebra osp(8|4) , according to whether the supersymmetry generators transform
in the vector, left-handed or right-handed spinor representation of so(6, 2). the anti-symmetric
tensor of any one of these three representations transform like the adjoint representation of so(6, 2).
for m-theory on ads7  s4 the relevant form is the one in which the supersymmetry generators
transform in the left-handed spinor representation of so(6, 2), such that it decomposes as (4 + 4)
under the compact subgroup su (4). denoting the supersymmetry generators of osp(8|4) as q i
we can write their anticommutators as [27]

nq i , q jo = 

2(cid:16)ij m   + c  uij(cid:17) .

1

(3 - 27)

where i, j, .. = 1, .., 4 and ,  = 1, ...8 . uij = uj i are the u sp(4) generators and ij =
j i is the symplectic invariant tensor. the tensor c   is the charge conjugation matrix in (6, 2)
dimensions and is symmetric [27]. furthermore , m   are related to the so(6, 2) generators mab
given in the previous section as follows:

the generators of u sp(4) satisfy:

m   =

1

8(cid:16)ab(cid:17) 

mab

(3 - 28)

[uij , ukl] = i(kul)j + j(kul)i

(3 - 29)

the commutation relations of so(6, 2) and u sp(4) with the supersymmetry generators are then of
the form[27]

[mab, q i ] =(cid:16)(m ab)(cid:17) 



q i ,

[uij , qk ] = k(iqj).

(3 - 30)

(3 - 31)

the superalgebra osp(8|4)has a three graded decomposition with respect to its compact sub-

superalgebra u (4|2)

where

g = l+  l0  l,

(3 - 32)

[l0, l]  l
[l+, l]  l0
[l+, l+] = 0 = [l, l].

9

(3 - 33)

(3 - 34)

here l0 represents the generators of u (4|2).
generalizing the (purely bosonic) oscillator construction for so(8) in section 2, the lie super-
algebra osp(8|4)can be realized in terms of bilinear combinations of bosonic and fermionic annihi-
lation and creation operators a(k) (a(k) = 
m (k)) which trans-
form covariantly and contravariantly, respectively, under the u (4|2) subsupergroup of osp(8|4)

a(k)) and m (k) (m (k) = 

a(k) =  ai(k)
b(l) =  bj(l)

(k) ! ,
(l) ! ,

a(k) =  ai(k)
b(l) =  bj(l)

na(k), b(l)i = {a(k), b(l)] = {a(k), b(l)] = 0,

a klk, l = 1, . . . , p

where { , ] represents an anti-commutator among any two fermionic oscillators and a commu-
tator otherwise. moreover, annihilation and creation operators are labelled by lower and upper
indices, respectively. the generators of osp(8|4)are given in terms of the above superoscillators
schematically as

aab = a  b  a  b = aij  a  qi
aab = a
m a

ab = b  a  b  a = aij  a  qi
j  m 

b = a  b + (1)(dega)(degb)b  a = m i

  qi

  q

i

(3 - 38)

where the boldfaced s and s indicate that we are taking an arbitrary number p of generations
of superoscillators and the dot represents the summation over the internal index k = 1, . . . , p (i.e.
a  m  p

k=1a(k)m (k)).

the even subgroup so(8)  u sp(4) is generated by the di-bosonic and di-fermionic generators.
in particular, one recovers the so(8) generators of section 2 in terms of the bosonic oscillators in
their su (4)  u (1)e basis:

aij = ai  bj  aj  bi,
aij = ai  bj  aj  bi,
m i
j = ai  aj + bj  bi,

(3 - 40)

10

here, nb = ai  ai + bi  bi is the bosonic number operator and e (which corresponds to the ads
energy) is the generator of u (1)e.

similarly, the u sp(4) generators in their su (2)  u (1) basis are expressed in terms of the

fermionic oscillators  and :

a =       
a =

(3 - 42)

3.2 unitary supermultiplets of osp(8|4)

to construct a basis for a lowest weight uir of osp(8|4), one starts from a set of states, collectively
denoted by |i, in the fock space of the oscillators a, b, ,  that transforms irreducibly under
u (4|2) and that is annihilated by all the generators aab  (aij  a  qi) of l

by acting on |i repeatedly with l+, one then generates an innite set of states that form a uir
of osp(8|4)

aab|i = 0.

(3 - 44)

|i, l+1|i, l+1l+1|i, . . .

(3 - 45)

the irreducibility of the resulting representation of osp(8|4)follows from the irreducibility of
|i under u (4|2). because of the property 3 - 44, |i as a whole will be referred to as the lowest
weight vector (lwv) of the corresponding uir of osp(8|4).

in the restriction to the subspace involving purely bosonic oscillators, the above construction
reduces to the subalgebra so(8) and its positive energy uirs as described in section 2. similarly,
when restricted to the subspace involving purely fermionic oscillators, one gets the compact internal
symmetry group u sp(4) (3 - 41), and the above construction yields the representations of u sp(4)
in its su (2) basis.

accordingly, a lowest weight uir of osp(8|4)decomposes into a direct sum of nitely many
positive energy uirs of so(8) transforming in certain representations of the internal symmetry
group u sp(4). thus, each positive energy uir of osp(8|4)corresponds to a supermultiplet of
elds living in ads7 or on its boundary. interpreted as a uir of the n =2 conformal superalgebra

11

in d=6, each lowest weight uir of osp(8|4)corresponds to a supermultiplet of massless or massive
elds.

we now briey describe the form in which our results are presented. consider an osp(8|4) lwv
(|i) which transforms in an irrep of u (4|2). |i can be decomposed into its irreducible components
under the even subgroup u (4)  u (2). this is most simply done by decomposing the supertableaux
of |i into the young tableaux of u (4)  u (2) using the results of [28]. these u (4)  u (2) irreps
correspond to lwvs of uirs of so(8)  u sp(4). in the tables given in subsequent sections, such
lwvs will be marked by an asterisk adjacent to their corresponding u (4)u (2) young tableaux. the
additional lwvs of so(8)  u sp(4) are obtained by acting on the lwv |i with the supersymmetry
generators qi repeatedly. these lwvs are listed in the tables without an asterisk. furthermore, the
tables below have been written in ascending order. that is, immediately following each lwv with
an asterisk are its descendant lwvs i.e, those lwvs obtained by acting on it with supersymmetry
generators. furthermore the su (4)d and su (4)d transformation properties of the lwvs of so(8)
are indicated by their dynkin labels . as explained above, the su (4)d labels coincide with the
su (4)d labels.

4 the doubleton supermultiplets of osp(8|4)

by choosing one pair of super oscillators ( and ) in the oscillator realization of osp(8|4)(i.e.
for p = 1), one obtains the so-called doubleton supermultiplets. these supermultiplets contain
only doubleton representations of so(8), i.e. they correspond to multiplets of elds living on the
boundary of ads7 without a 7d poincare limit. equivalently, they can be characterized as multi-
plets of massless elds in 6d minkowski space that form a uir of the n = 2 superconformal algebra
osp(8|4).

the doubleton supermultiplet of osp(8|4) , which is dened by the lowest weight vector,
|i = |0i, is the (2,0) conformal supermultiplet and is the analog of the n = 4 super yang-mills
multiplet in d = 6 [8]. the content of the (2,0) supermultiplet is given in table 1.

5 the massless supermultiplets

the doubleton supermultiplets described in the last section are fundamental in the sense that
all other lowest weight uirs of osp(8|4)occur in the tensor product of two or more doubleton
supermultiplets.
instead of trying to identify these irreducible submultiplets in the (in general
reducible, but not fully reducible) tensor products, one simply increases the number p of oscillator
generations so that the tensoring becomes implicit while the irreducibility stays manifest.

13

the simplest class, corresponding to p = 2, contains the supermultiplets that are known to be
massless in the 7d ads sense. we will therefore label all supermultiplets that are obtained by
taking p = 2 in the oscillator construction despite some problems with the invariant denition of
the notion of mass in ads spacetimes [16].

we will now give a complete list of the allowed osp(8|4)lowest weight vectors |i for p =2.
the condition l|0i leaves the following possibilities:

 |i = |0i. this lwv gives rise n =4 graviton supermultiplet in ads7 and occurs in the tensor

product of two cpt self-conjugate doubleton supermultiplets.

 a1(1)a2 (1)|0i = |      i. alternatively, one could use the states a1(2)a2 (2)|0i,

b1(1)b2 (1)|0i, b1(2)b2 (2)|0i, (a1(1)b1)(2)|0i, or (a1(2)b1)(1)|0i.

a1(2)a2 (2)    a2j (2)|0i, b1 (1)b2 (1) . . . b2j (1)|0i, b1 (2)b2 (2) . . . b2j (2)|0i,
(a1(1)a2 (1)    ar (1)br+1(2)br+2 (2)    b2j )(2)|0i,
or (a1(2)a2 (2)    ar (2)br+1 (1)br+2(1)    b2j )(1)|0i.
increasing j leads to multiplets with higher and higher spins and ads energies.

in addition to these purely (super)symmetrized lwvs, one can also anti-(super)symmetrize pairs

of superoscillators, since p =2. the condition l|0i leaves the following possibilities:

 |i = [a1(1)b1](2) . . . [a2j (1)b2j ](2)a2j+1 (1) . . . a2j+n(1)|0i

6 discussion and conclusions

we saw in section [4] that there exist innitely many doubleton supermultiplets of osp(8|4). the
cpt-self-conjugate irreducible doubleton supermultiplet appears as gauge modes in the kaluza-
klein spectrum of 11-d sugra over s4 and decouples from the spectrum. it is the supermultiplet
of the (2,0) superconformal theory in d=6 which is believed to be dual to m-theory over ads7  s4.
this is in complete parallel to the duality between the large n limit of n =4 supersymmetric su (n )
yang-mills theory and the iib superstring theory over ads5s5. the other non-cpt self-conjugate
doubleton supermultiplets of osp(8|4)correspond to the doubleton supermultiplets of su (2, 2|4)
in the case of su (2, 2|4), it was conjectured [17] that these
with non-zero central charge [17].
non-cpt self-conjugate doubleton supermultiplets are related to (p, q) superstrings [29]. hence,
we expect the non-cpt self-conjugate doubleton supermultiplets of osp(8|4)to be related to the
sector of m-theory that is dual to (p, q) superstrings.

since the  are bosonic spinors one can give a dynamical realization of the oscillator construction
of the uirs of osp(8|4) in the language of six dimensional twistors as was suggested for the d = 4
conformal group in [17] and explicitly realized in [18, 24]. based on results in [18, 24], we expect that
such a dynamical (twistorial) realization of the oscillator construction of the uirs of osp(8|4)to
correspond to some extreme limit of m-theory over ads7  s4.

in section [5] we gave a complete list of massless supermultiplets of osp(8|4)considered as
n =4 supersymmetry algebra in ads7. the cpt self-conjugate massless supermultiplet is simply
the graviton supermultiplet. the other massless supermultiplets have spin range between 2 and 4.
one can easily extend the above construction to build all the positive energy massive supermul-
tiplets of osp(8|4)by taking p > 2. the short massive supermultiplets of spin range 2 (vacuum
supermultiplets) correspond to the massive kaluza-klein spectrum of 11-d sugra over s4 [8].

we should stress that there are three dierent forms of the superalgebra osp(8|4) related via
triality. the form considered in this paper as well as in [8] satises the standard spin and statistics
connection and is the one relevant for the sector of m-theory over ads7  s4 containing the 11
dimensional supergravity. it is an open question whether or not the other forms of osp(8|4)with
exotic spin and statistics connection are relevant to m-theory. one would have naively expected the
form of osp(8|4)
in which the supersymmetry generators transform in the right-handed spinor
representation of so(6, 2) to satisfy the usual spin and statistics connection. however, since the
right handed spinor representation decomposes as (1+6+1) under su (4) subgroup it is evident that
the supersymmetry generators in this case can not satisfy the usual spin and statistics connection.
