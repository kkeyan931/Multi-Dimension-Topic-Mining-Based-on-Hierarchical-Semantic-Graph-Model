1 introduction

supermembranes [1] were proposed as a consistent quantum-mechanical exten-
sion of 11-dimensional supergravity [2], inspired by the way in which string theory
denes a quantum-mechanical extension of 10-dimensional supergravity theories.
although there are similarities in the theoretical description of superstrings and
supermembranes, there are also a number of features that are distinctly dif-
ferent. an elementary superstring can be formulated as a eld theory on the
2-dimensional worldsheet swept out by the string in minkowski space. this eld
theory is free and describes an innite number of states with a discrete equidis-
tant mass spectrum with steps measured by 1/, the fundamental mass scale
of string theory. likewise the supermembrane theory can be formulated as a
eld theory on a 3-dimensional world volume. but unlike the previous case, this
theory is not a free but an interacting theory of a complicated structure. fur-
thermore the mass spectrum of the supermembrane is continuous, rather than
discrete [3]. this is not a generic feature of quantized extended objects, but cru-
cially rests on the presence of supersymmetry. at an early stage the question was
raised whether, in view of haags theorem, the supermembrane should not be
regarded as a second- rather than a rst-quantized theory, with a unitarily non-
implementable evolution matrix [4]. as it turns out, both issues are resolved in
the context of a more recent perspective in which the continuity of the spectrum is
seen as arising from multi-membrane states. the theory, set up initially to dene
a rst-quantized supermembrane, captures also the presence of multi-membrane
states as described in a second-quantized theory. again this feature strongly
hinges on supersymmetry: for the generic theory there is not reason why states
of several interacting membranes should give rise to a continuous mass spectrum.

the continuity of the supermembrane spectrum is due to the fact that, quantum-

mechanically, the supermembrane can develop stringlike zero-area spikes which
do not contribute to the mass. consequently a membrane can be pinched into
two or more membranes connected by these stringlike congurations of arbitrary
length, which become indistinguishable from the multi-membrane state obtained
by suppressing the connecting strings. in this way, not only are single- and multi-
membrane states indistinguishable, but so are certain states of dierent topology
and states with and without winding (so that topology changes will correspond
to smooth transitions in the moduli space that parametrizes these states). thus
the rst-quantized theory of spherical supermembranes ultimately describes also
membranes of nontrivial topology, multi-membrane states and (if the target space
has compact coordinates) supermembranes with winding.

in 11 spacetime dimensions the supermembrane can consistently couple to a
superspace background that satises a number of constraints which are equiva-
lent to the supergravity equations of motion. the supermembrane action can also
exist in 4, 5 and 7 spacetime dimensions, in the same way as the green-schwarz
superstring [5] is classically consistent in 3, 4, 6 and 10 dimensions. in the context

1

of string theory it was natural to expect that the massless states of the superme-
mbrane would correspond to those of 11-dimensional supergravity. however, in
the presence of a continuous mass spectrum [3] the possible existence of massless
states is dicult to prove or disprove [4, 6, 7]. the unability to make sense of
the mass spectrum and the fact that 11-dimensional supergravity seemed to have
no place in string theory, formed an obstacle for further development of the the-
ory. more recently, however, interest in supermembranes was rekindled by the
realization that 11-dimensional supergravity does have its role to play as the long-
distance approximation to m-theory [8, 9, 10, 11]. m-theory is the conjectured
framework for unifying all ve superstring theories and 11-dimensional super-
gravity. it turns out that supermembranes, m-theory and super-matrix-models
are all intricately related.

an important observation was that it is possible to regularize the superme-
mbrane in terms of a super matrix model based on some nite group, such as
u(n). in the limit of innite n one then recovers the supermembrane [4]. these
supersymmetric matrix models were constructed long ago [12] and can be ob-
tained from supersymmetric yang-mills theories in the zero-volume limit. more
recently it was realized that these models describe the short-distance behaviour
of n dirichlet particles [13]. the continuity of the spectrum is then understood
directly in terms of the spectrum of n-particle states. a bold conjecture was
that these super matrix models capture the degrees of freedom of m-theory [14].
in the large-n limit, where one considers the states with an innite number of
particles, the supermembranes should then re-emerge. furthermore there is ev-
idence meanwhile that the supermembrane has massless states [15], which will
presumably correspond to the states of 11-dimensional supergravity, although
proper asymptotic states do not exist. the evidence is based on the matrix
model regularization of the supermembrane for low values of n. for xed value
of n the existence of such states was foreseen on the basis of identifying the
kaluza-klein states of m-theory compactied on s1 with the dirichlet particles
and their bound states in type-iia string theory.

from this viewpoint it is natural to consider the supermembrane in curved
backgrounds associated with 11-dimensional supergravity. such backgrounds con-
sist of a nontrivial metric, a three-index gauge eld and a gravitino eld. this
provides us with an action that transforms as a scalar under the combined (local)
supersymmetry transformations of the background elds and the supermembrane
embedding coordinates. here it is important to realize that the supersymmetry
transformations of the embedding coordinates will themselves depend on the
background. when the background is supersymmetric, then the action will be
supersymmetric as well.
in the light-cone formulation this model will lead to
models invariant under area-preserving dieomorphisms, which in certain situa-
tions can be approximated by matrix models in curved backgrounds. the area-
preserving dieomorphisms are then replaced by a nite group, such as u(n), but
target-space dieomorphisms are no longer manifestly realized. matrix models

2

in curved space have already been studied in [16]. recently toroidal compact-
ications of matrix theory were considered in which the three-form gauge eld
of 11-dimensional gravity plays a crucial role [17]. these compactications ex-
hibit interesting features in which the noncommutative torus appears as a new
solution to compactied matrix theory. we should also point out that classical
supermembrane solutions in nontrivial backgrounds have been discussed before,
see, e.g. [18]. in view of the relation between near-horizon geometries and con-
formal eld theories [19] interesting classes of backgrounds are the ones where
the target space factorizes locally into the product of an ads space and some
compact space.

in this lecture we review many of these topics starting from the supermem-
brane point of view. we should stress that there remain many open questions and
problems, both for supermembranes and for super matrix models. for instance,
the large-n behaviour is still poorly understood as are features related to matrix
models and membranes in nontrivial backgrounds. but the most intriguing ques-
tions concern the precise role that these theories play in m-theory, the theory
that encompasses all known perturbative string theories. for other reviews, we
refer to [20]; a number of related topics was also discussed in the workshop and
can be found in this volume.

2 supermembranes

fundamental supermembranes can be described in terms of actions of the green-
schwarz type, possibly in a nontrivial but restricted (super)spacetime background
[1]. such actions exist for supersymmetric p-branes, where p = 0, 1, . . . , d  1
denes the spatial dimension of the brane. thus for p = 0 we have a superparticle,
for p = 1 a superstring, for p = 2 a supermembrane, and so on. the dimension of
spacetime in which the superbrane can live is very restricted. these restrictions
arise from the fact that the action contains a wess-zumino-witten term, whose
supersymmetry depends sensitively on the spacetime dimension. if the coecient
of this term takes a particular value then the action possesses an additional
fermionic gauge symmetry, the so-called -symmetry. this symmetry is necessary
to ensure the matching of (physical) bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.
in the following we restrict ourselves to supermembranes (i.e., p = 2) in 11
dimensions.

the 11-dimensional supermembrane [1] is written in terms of superspace em-
bedding coordinates z m () = (x (), ()), which are functions of the three
world-volume coordinates  i (i = 0, 1, 2). it couples to the superspace geome-
a and the
try of 11-dimensional supergravity, encoded by the supervielbein em

a is the pull-back of the supervielbein to the mem-

brane worldvolume. here the induced metric equals gij = r
j rs, with rs
being the constant lorentz-invariant metric. this action is invariant under local
fermionic  transformations alluded to above, given that certain constraints on
the background elds hold, which are equivalent to the equations of motion of
11-dimensional supergravity [1].

(2)

the gamma matrices are denoted by r; gamma matrices with more than one
index denote antisymmetrized products of gamma matrices with unit weight. in
at superspace the supermembrane lagrangian, written in components, reads (in
the notation and conventions of [4]),

l = qg(x, )  ijk kh 1

i ji ,

(3)

the target space can have compact dimensions which permit winding membrane
states [21]. in at superspace the induced metric,

gij = (ix  + i)(jx  + j)  ,

(4)

is supersymmetric. therefore the rst term in (3) is trivially invariant under
spacetime supersymmetry,

x  =  ,

 =  .

(5)

in 4, 5, 7, or 11 spacetime dimensions the second term in the action proportional
to ijk is also supersymmetric (up to a total divergence) and the full action is
invariant under -symmetry.

in the case of the open supermembrane, -symmetry imposes boundary con-
ditions on the elds [22, 23]. they must ensure that the following integral over
the boundary of the membrane world volume vanishes,

zm h 1

1our notation and conventions are as follows. tangent-space indices are a = (r, a), whereas
curved indices are denoted by m = (, ). here r,  refer to commuting and a,  to anticom-
muting coordinates. moreover we take 012 = 012 = 1.

4

this can be achieved by having a membrane d-p-brane at the boundary with
p = 1, 5, or 9, which is dened in terms of (p + 1) neumann and (10  p)
dirichlet boundary conditions for the x , together with corresponding boundary
conditions on the fermionic coordinates. more explicitly, we dene projection
operators

p = 1

2(cid:16)1  p+1 p+2    10(cid:17) ,

(7)

(8)

and impose the dirichlet boundary conditions

k x m| = 0 ,
p| = 0 ,

m = p + 1, . . . , 10 ,

where  and k dene the world-volume derivatives perpendicular or tangen-
tial to the surface swept out by the membrane boundary in the target space.
note that the fermionic boundary condition implies that pk = 0. further-
more, it implies that spacetime supersymmetry is reduced to only 16 supercharges
associated with spinor parameters p+, which is chiral with respect to the (p+1)-
dimensional world volume of the d-p-brane at the boundary. with respect to this
reduced supersymmetry, the superspace coordinates decompose into two parts,
one corresponding to (x m ,p) and the other corresponding to (x m,p+) where
m = 0, 1, . . . , p. while for the ve-brane these superspaces exhibit a somewhat
balanced decomposition in terms of an equal number of bosonic and fermionic co-
ordinates, the situation for p = 1, 9 shows heterotic features in that one space has
an excess of fermionic and the other an excess of bosonic coordinates. moreover,
we note that supersymmetry may be further broken, e.g. by choosing dierent
dirichlet conditions on nonconnected segments of the supermembrane boundary.
the dirichlet boundary conditions can be supplemented by the following neu-

mann boundary conditions,

 x m| = 0
p+| = 0 .

m = 0, 1, . . . , p ,

(9)

these do not lead to a further breakdown of the rigid spacetime symmetries.

we now continue and follow the light-cone quantization described in [4] for a
closed membrane without winding. in the light-cone gauge the light-cone coor-
dinate x + = (x 1 + x 0)/2 is linearly identied with to the world-volume time
denoted by  and the fermionic coordinates are subject to the gauge condition
+  = 0. the momentum p is time independent and proportional to the center-
of-mass (cm) value p +
whose spacesheet integral is normalized to unity. hence we have

0 = (p)0 times some density qw() of the spacesheet,

p +

0 = z d2 p +().

5

(10)

the cm momentum p 

0 is equal to minus the hamiltonian and takes the form

0 z d2 w(cid:20) p a pa

2 w

+ 1

4{ x a, x b }2  p +

0

 a { x a,  }(cid:21) . (11)

here the integral runs over the spatial components of the world volume denoted
by 1 and 2, while p a() (a = 2, . . . , 9) are the momenta conjugate to the
transverse coordinates x a. furthermore we made use of the poisson bracket
{a, b} dened by

{a(), b()} =

rs ra() sb().

(12)

qw()

note that the coordinate x  = (x 1  x 0)/2 itself does not appear in the

hamiltonian (11). it is dened via

0 rx  = 
p +

p  rx
w  p +

0

r ,

(13)

and implies that the right-hand side of (13) must be closed; without winding in
x , it must be exact. this constraint is important later on.

the other cm coordinates and momenta are

p0 = z d2 p ,

x0 = z d2qw() x() ,

0 = z d2qw() () .

(14)

in the light-cone gauge we are left with the transverse coordinates x and cor-
responding momenta p, which transform as vectors under the so(9) group of
transverse rotations. only sixteen fermionic components  remain, which trans-
form as so(9) spinors. furthermore we have the cm momentum p +
0 and the
center-of-mass coordinate x 

0 (the remaining modes in x  are dependent).

the supermembrane hamiltonian (11) can be decomposed as follows,

h =

p 2
0
2p +
0

+ m2
2p +
0

.

(15)

because the hamiltonian is equal to p 
0 , m is the supermembrane mass op-
erator, which does not depend on any of the cm coordinates or momenta. the
explicit expression for m2 is

m2 = z d2 qw()(cid:20) [p2()]

w()

+ 1

2(cid:16){x a, x b}(cid:17)2

 2p +

0

a{x a, }(cid:21) ,

(16)

where [p2] indicates that the contribution of the cm momentum p0 is sup-
pressed.

the structure of the hamiltonian (15) shows that the wave functions for the
supermembrane now factorize into a wave function of the cm modes and a wave

6

function of the supersymmetric quantum-mechanical system that describes the
other modes. for the latter the mass operator plays the role of the hamilto-
nian of a supersymmetric model in quantum mechanics. the aspects related to
supersymmetry will be discussed in the next section.

in the light-cone gauge there is still a residual invariance associated with area-
preserving dieomorphisms of the membrane spacesheet. these are dened by
transformations

with

r  r + r() ,
r(qw() r() ) = 0.

(17)

(18)

it is convenient to rewrite this condition in terms of dual spacesheet vectors by

qw() r() = rs s() .

(19)

in the language of dierential forms the condition (18) then implies that r cor-
responds to a closed one-form. the trivial solutions are the exact forms, in
components,

r = r() ,

(20)

for any globally dened function (). the nontrivial solutions are the closed
forms which are not exact. on a riemann surface of genus g there are precisely 2g
linearly independent non-exact closed forms, whose integrals along the homology
cycles are normalized to unity. in components we write

r = () r ,

 = 1, . . . , 2g .

(21)

the presence of the closed but non-exact forms is crucial for describing the
winding of the embedding coordinates. more precisely, while the momenta p()
and the fermionic coordinates () remain single valued on the spacesheet, the
embedding coordinates, written as one-forms with components rx() and rx (),
are decomposed into closed one-forms. their non-exact contributions are multi-
plied by an integer times the length of the compact direction.

3 gauge theory of area-preserving dieomor-

phisms

it turns out that the light-cone formulation of the supermembrane can be de-
scribed as a gauge theory of area-preserving dieomorphisms. under these dif-
feomorphisms the elds x a, x  and  transform according to

x a =

rs
w

r sx a ,

x  =

rs
w

7

r sx  ,

a =

rs
w

r s ,

(22)

where the time-dependent reparametrization r consists of closed exact and non-
exact parts. the commutator of two innitesimal area-preserving dieomor-
phisms is determined by the product rule

(3)

r = r  st
w

s (1)
(2)

t ! ,

(23)

r

are closed vectors. because (3)

where both (1,2)
is exact, the exact vectors thus
generate an invariant subgroup of the area-preserving dieomorphisms. as we
shall discuss in the next section this subgroup can be approximated by su(n)
in the large-n limit, at least for closed membranes. for open membranes the
boundary conditions on the elds (8) lead to a smaller group, such as so(n).
accordingly there is a gauge eld r, which is therefore closed as well and trans-
forming as

r

r = 0r + r(cid:18) st
w

s t(cid:19) .

(24)

corresponding covariant derivatives are

d0x a = 0x a 

rs
w

r sx a ,

d0 = 0 

rs
w

r s ,

(25)

and likewise for d0x .

the action corresponding to the following lagrangian density is then gauge

invariant under the transformations (22) and (24),
2 (d0x)2 +   d0  1
+(p +

0 wh 1

l = p +

0 )1   a {x a, } + d0x i ,

4 (p +

0 )2 {x a, x b}2

(26)

where we draw attention to the last term proportional to x , which can be
dropped in the absence of winding. moreover, we note that for open supermem-
branes, (26) is invariant under the transformations (22) and (24) only if k = 0
holds on the boundary. this condition denes a subgroup of the group of area-
preserving transformations, which is consistent with the dirichlet conditions (8).
observe that here k and  refer to the spacesheet derivatives tangential and
perpendicular to the membrane boundary2.

the action corresponding to (26) is also invariant under the supersymmetry

transformations

x a = 2  a  ,
 = 1
r = 2 (p +

0 )1  r .

2 + (d0x a a + )  + 1

4 (p +

0 )1 {x a, x b} + ab ,

(27)

2consistency of the neumann boundary conditions (9) with the area-preserving dieomor-
phisms (22) further imposes k = 0 on the boundary, where indices are raised according to
(19).

8

the supersymmetry variation of x  is not relevant and may be set to zero. for
open membranes one nds that the boundary conditions k = 0 and  = p+ 
must be fullled in order for (27) to be a symmetry of the action. in that case
the theory takes the form of a gauge theory coupled to matter. the pure gauge
theory is associated with the dirichlet and the matter with the neumann (bosonic
and fermionic) coordinates.

in the case of a membrane d-9-brane one now sees that the degrees of free-
dom on the end-of-the world 9-brane precisely match those of 10-dimensional
heterotic strings. on the boundary we are left with eight propagating bosons x m
(with m = 2, . . . , 9), as x 10 is constant on the boundary due to (8), paired with
the 8-dimensional chiral spinors  (subject to + = p = 0), i.e., the scenario
of horava-witten [11].
the full equivalence with the membrane hamiltonian is now established by
choosing the r = 0 gauge and passing to the hamiltonian formalism. the eld
equations for r then lead to the membrane constraint (13) (up to exact contri-
butions), partially dening x . moreover the hamiltonian corresponding to the
gauge theory lagrangian of (26) is nothing but the light-cone supermembrane
hamiltonian (11). observe that in the above gauge theoretical construction the
space-sheet metric wrs enters only through its density w and hence vanishing
or singular metric components do not pose problems.

we are now in a position to study the full 11-dimensional supersymmetry
algebra of the winding supermembrane. for this we decompose the supersymme-
try charge q associated with the transformations (27), into two 16-component
spinors,

q = q+ + q, where q = 1

2   q ,

to obtain

q+ = z d2(cid:16) 2 p a a + w { x a, x b } ab(cid:17)  ,

q = 2 p +

0 z d2 w  .

(28)

(29)

in the presence of winding the supersymmetry algebra takes the form [21]

( q+

 , q+

 )db = 2 (+) h  2 (a +) z d2 w { x a, x  } ,
 )db = (a + ) p a
 )db = 2 () p +
0 ,

2 (ab +) z d2 w { x a, x b } ,

0  1

 , q
 , q

( q+

( q

(30)

where use has been made of the dirac brackets of the phase-space variables and
the dening equation (13) for rx .

the new feature of this supersymmetry algebra is the emergence of the central
charges in the rst two anticommutators, which are generated through the wind-
ing contributions. they represent topological quantities obtained by integrating

9

the winding densities

and

za() = rs rx a sx 

zab() = rs rx a sx b

(31)

(32)

over the space-sheet. it is gratifying to observe the manifest lorentz invariance of
(30). here we should point out that, in adopting the light-cone gauge, we assumed
that there was no winding for the coordinate x +.
in [24] the corresponding
algebra for the matrix regularization was studied. the result coincides with
ours in the large-n limit, in which an additional longitudinal ve-brane charge
vanishes, provided that one identies the longitudinal two-brane charge with the
central charge in the rst line of (30). this identication requires the denition of
x  in the matrix regularization, a topic that we return to in the next section. the
form of the algebra is another indication of the consistency of the supermembrane-
supergravity system.

until now we discussed the general case of a at target space with possible
winding states. to make the identication with the matrix models more explicit,
let us again ignore the winding and split o the center-of-mass (cm) variables as
in the previous section. as discussed there the structure of the hamiltonian (15)
shows that the wave functions for the supermembrane now factorize into a trivial
wave function pertaining to the cm modes and a wave function of the supersym-
metric quantum-mechanical system that describes the other (interacting) modes.
for the latter the mass operator plays the role of the hamiltonian. when the
mass operator vanishes on the state, then the 32 supercharges act exclusively on
the cm coordinates and generate a massless supermultiplet of eleven-dimensional
supersymmetry. in case there is no other degeneracy beyond that caused by su-
persymmetry, the resulting supermultiplet is the one of supergravity, describing
the graviton, the antisymmetric tensor and the gravitino. in terms of the so(9)
helicity representations, it consists of 44  84 bosonic and 128 fermionic states.
for an explicit construction of these states, see [25]. when the mass operator
does not vanish on the states, we are dealing with huge supermultiplets consisting
of multiples of 215 + 215 states.

4 the matrix approximation

one may expand the supermembrane coordinates and momenta on the spacesheet
in a complete set of functions ya with a = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,. it is convenient to
choose y0 = 1. furthermore we choose a basis of the closed one-forms, consisting
of the exact ones, rya, and a set of closed nonexact forms denoted by ()r.
completeness of the ya implies the following decompositions,

{ya, yb} = fab

c yc ,

10

rs
w
rs
w

()r sya = fa

b yb ,

()r ()s = f

a ya ,

(33)

so that the constants f ab
a represent the structure constants of
the innite-dimensional group of area-preserving dieomorphisms. lowering of
indices can be done with the help of the invariant metric

b and f

c, fa

ab = z d2qw() ya() yb() .

(34)

there is no need to introduce a metric for the  indices. observe that we have
00 = 1. furthermore it is convenient to choose the functions ya with a  1 such
that 0a = 0. completeness implies

ab ya() yb() =

1

qw()

(2)(, ) .

(35)

after lowering of upper indices, the structure constants are dened as follows
[26, 21],

fabc = z d2 rs rya() syb() yc() ,
fbc = z d2 rs () r() syb() yc() ,
fc = z d2 rs () r() () s() yc() .

(36)

note that we have fab0 = fb0 = 0.

using the above basis one may write down the following mode expansions for

the phase-space variables of the supermembrane,

xa rya() ,

x () r() +xa
rx() = x
p() = xa qw() pa ya() ,
() = xa

a ya() ,

(37)

introducing winding modes for the transverse coordinates x. a similar expansion
exists for x .

other tensors are needed, for instance, to write down the lorentz algebra

generators [26]. an obvious tensor is given by

dabc = z d2qw() ya() yb() yc() ,

(38)

11

which is symmetric in all three indices and satises dab0 = ab. another tensor,
whose denition is more subtle, arises when expressing x  in terms of the other
coordinates and momenta. we recall that x  is restricted by (13), which implies
the following gauss-type constraint,

a = fbc

ahpb  xc + p +

0

bci + fb

a pb  x  0 .

(39)

the coordinate x  receives contributions proportional to ya(), which can be
parametrized by (a 6= 0)

in addition x  has cm and winding modes. observe that the tensors ca
bc
and ca
b are ambiguous, as (40) is only dened up to the constraints (39). the
symmetric component of ca
cb =
2dabc. note that ca
b0 = 0. there are many other identities between the
various tensors which can be derived by using completeness. some examples are
[26],

bc is, however, xed and given by ca

the rst identity is just the jacobi identity for the structure constants of the
group of area-preserving dieomorphisms and the second expresses the fact that
dabc is a group-invariant tensor.

it is possible to replace the group of the area-preserving dieomorphisms by a
nite group, so that (16) denes the hamiltonian of a supersymmetric quantum-
mechanical system based on a nite number of degrees of freedom [27]. in a suit-
able limit to the innite-dimensional group we thus recover the supermembrane.
this observation enables one to regularize the supermembrane in a supersym-
metric way by considering a limiting procedure based on a sequence of groups
whose limit yields the area-preserving dieomorphisms. for membranes of cer-
tain topology it is known how to approximate a (sub)group of the area-preserving
dieomorphisms as a particular n   limit of su(n). to be precise, it can
be shown that the structure constants of su(n) tend to those of the invariant
subgroup of the dieomorphisms generated by the exact vectors, up to correc-
tions of order 1/n 2. the structure of the corresponding truncations are shown in
fig. 1 for a spherical and a toroidal membrane. while some of the identities (41)
remain valid at nite n, others receive corrections of order 1/n 2. furthermore,
the tensors ca
b are intrinsically undened at nite n. therefore, the
expression for x  is ambiguous for the matrix model and lorentz invariance
holds only in the large-n limit [26, 28]. we should add that the matrix regular-
ization works also for the case of open supermembranes. in that case one deals
with certain subgroups of su(n). we refer to [23] for further details.

{ya, yb} = fab
ab = r d2 w yayb  ab = tr (tatb)
r d2 w {ya, yb} = 0  tr ([ta, tb]) = 0

we should stress that the nature of the large-n limit itself is subtle and is
connected to the membrane topology. as long as n is nite, no distinction can
be made with regard to the topology and clearly the generators of u(n) as found
for dierent topologies are related by a simple similarity transformation. in this
way one may establish a mapping between functions on the sphere decomposed
into a nite number of spherical harmonics with l < n and functions on the torus
decomposed into a nite number of fourier modes belonging to some fundamental
lattice (see fig. 1). but in fact there are inequivalent n   limits. this is in
line with the fact that there exists no mapping between dierentiable functions
on the sphere and the torus in general, in view of their dierent topological
structure (cf. the discussion in appendix b of [26]). but when taking the trace
the precise nature of the large-n limit seems less relevant. however, at this point,
the dieomorphisms associated with the harmonic vectors remain problematic;
as it turns out they cannot be incorporated for nite n, at least not at the
level of the lie algebra. this was shown in [26], where it was established that
the nite-n approximation to the structure constants fbc violates the jacobi
identities for a toroidal membrane. therefore it seems impossible to present a
matrix model regularization of the supermembrane with winding contributions.
there exists a standard prescription for dealing with matrix models with winding
[29], however, which is therefore conceptually dierent. the consequences of this

13

dierence are not well understood. the prescription amounts to adopting the
gauge group [u(n)]m , for winding in one dimension, which in the limit m  
leads to supersymmetric yang-mills theories in 1 + 1 dimensions [29]. hence,
in this way it is possible to extract extra dimensions from a suitably chosen
innite-dimensional gauge group. this approach can obviously be generalized to
a hypertorus.

5 supersymmetric matrix models and their en-

ergy spectrum

the models that one obtains by a truncation of the gauge group of area-preserving
dieomorphisms to a nite group belong to a class of models proposed long ago
as extended models of supersymmetric quantum mechanics with more than four
supersymmetries [12]. these theories can also be obtained from a supersymmetric
gauge theory in the zero-volume limit. they are based on the hamiltonian,

h =

1
g

trh 1

2 p2  1

4[x a, x b]2 + 1

2 g ta[x a, ]i ,

(43)

and depend on a number of d-dimensional coordinates x = (x 1, . . . , x d), cor-
responding momenta p, as well as real spinorial anticommuting coordinates ,
all taking values in the matrix representation of some lie algebra. the phase
space is restricted to the subspace invariant under the corresponding (compact)
lie group and is therefore subject to gauss-type constraints. these constraints
coincide with the ones discussed in the previous section. the spatial dimension
d and the corresponding spinor dimension are restricted. the models exist for
d = 2, 3, 5, or 9 dimensions; the (real) spinor dimension equals 2, 4, 8, or 16,
respectively. naturally this is also the number of independent supercharges.

just as for the supermembrane we restrict ourselves to the highest-dimensional
case. in that case the model contains 16 supercharges, denoted by q+. however,
additional charges can be obtained when the gauge group has abelian factors by
including the zero modes of the fermion eld belonging to the abelian supermul-
tiplet (the supercharge of the abelian supermultiplet is already contained in the
16 supercharges, in order that one obtains the total hamiltonian from the anti-
commutator of these supercharges). the extra charges will be denoted by q.
assuming one abelian component associated with the matrix trace, we thus have
32 supercharges dened by

q+ = trh(p aa + 1

2 i[x a, x b]ab) i ,

q = g tr [  ] .

(44)

the q+ generate the familiar supersymmetry algebra (in the group-invariant
subspace),

(45)

it is possible, though subtle, to also evaluate the central charges of the supersym-
metry algebra for the matrix models [24], which at large n tend to the winding
charges exhibited in (30).

as explained in the previous section the supermembrane in the light-cone for-
mulation is described by a quantum-mechanical model of the type above with an
innite-dimensional gauge group corresponding to the area-preserving dieomor-
phisms of the membrane spacesheet [4] and a coupling constant g given by the
total light-cone momentum (p)0. the fact that nite truncations of the gauge
group are possible allows one to study supermembranes in a convenient regular-
ization. the connection with the supermembrane shows that the manifest so(9)
symmetry, which from the viewpoint of the supermembrane is simply the exact
transverse rotational invariance of the lightcone formulation, extends to the full
11-dimensional lorentz group in the limit of an appropriate innite-dimensional
gauge group [26, 28].

classical zero-energy congurations require all commutators to vanish,

[x a, x b] = 0 .

(46)

dividing out the gauge group implies that zero-energy congurations are parame-
trized by r9n /sn . the zero-energy valleys characterized by (46) extend all the
way to innity where they become increasingly narrow. their existence raises
questions about the nature of the spectrum of the hamiltonian (43).
in the
bosonic versions of these models the wave function cannot freely extend to innity,
because at large distances it becomes more and more squeezed in the valley. by
the uncertainty principle, this gives rise to kinetic-energy contributions which
increase monotonically along the valley. another way to understand this eect
is by noting that oscillations perpendicular to the valleys give rise to a zero-
point energy, which induces an eective potential barrier that connes the wave
function. this connement causes the spectrum to be discrete. however, for the
supersymmetric models dened by (43) the situation is dierent. supersymmetry
can cause a cancellation of the transverse zero-point energy. then the wave
function is no longer conned, indicating that the supersymmetric models have
a continuous spectrum. the latter was rigourously proven for the gauge group
su(n) [3].

whether or not the hamiltonian (43) allows normalizable or localizable zero-
energy states, superimposed on the continuous spectrum, is a subtle question.
early discussion on the existence of such zero-energy states can be found in [4, 6];
more recent discussions can be found in [7, 15]. according to [15] such states do
indeed exist in d = 9. we should emphasize that there is an important dierence
between states whose energy is exactly equal to zero and states of positive energy.
the supersymmetry algebra implies that zero-energy states are annihilated by the
supercharges. hence, they are supersinglets. the positive-energy states, on the
other hand, must constitute full supermultiplets. so they are multiplets consisting

15

of multiples of 128 + 128 bosonic + fermionic states (for d = 9). however, the
presence of the extra suspersymmetry charge causes a further degeneration by
128 + 128 states, so that one obtains zero-energy multiplets of 256 states or
positive-energy multiplets comprising (multiples of) 65536 states.

for the supermembrane, the classical zero-mass congurations correspond
to zero-area stringlike congurations of arbitrary length, characterized by the
condition that

{x a(), x b()} = 0 .

(47)

as the supermembrane mass is described by a hamiltonian of the type (43),
the mass spectrum of the supermembrane is continuous for the same reasons
as given above. for a supermembrane moving in a target space with compact
dimensions, winding may raise the mass of the membrane state. this is so because
winding in more than one direction gives rise to a nonzero central charge in the
supersymmetry algebra, which sets a lower limit on the membrane mass. this fact
should not be interpreted as an indication that the spectrum becomes discrete.
the possible continuity of the spectrum hinges on the two features mentioned
above. first the system should possess continuous valleys of classically degenerate
states. qualitatively one recognizes immediately that this feature is not directly
aected by winding. a classical membrane with winding can still have stringlike
congurations of arbitrary length, without increasing its area. hence the classical
instability persists. the second feature is supersymmetry. without winding it
is clear that the valley congurations are supersymmetric, so that one concludes
that the spectrum is continuous. with winding the latter aspect is more subtle.
however, we note that, when the winding density is concentrated in one part
of the spacesheet, then valleys can emerge elsewhere corresponding to stringlike
congurations with supersymmetry. hence, as a space-sheet local eld theory,
supersymmetry can be broken in one region where the winding is concentrated
and unbroken in another. in the latter region stringlike congurations can form,
which, at least semiclassically, will not be suppressed by quantum corrections [21].
however, in this case we can only describe the generic features of the spectrum.
these arguments do not preclude the existence of mass gaps. because massless
states exist for the d = 9 matrix models, we should expect them to exist for
the supermembrane. in a at target space these massless states will constitute
massless supermultiplets in 11 spacetime dimensions and will presumably coincide
with supermultiplet of states of 11-dimensional supergravity.

the continuous mass spectrum of the supermembrane forms an obstacle in
interpretating the membrane states as elementary particles, in analogy to what is
done in string theory. instead the continuity of the spectrum should be viewed as
a result of the fact that supermembrane states do not really exist as asymptotic
states. as we discussed already in section 1 the membrane collapses into stringlike
congurations and the resulting states are to be interpreted as multi-membrane
states which possess a continuous mass spectrum. qualitatively, the situation for

16

the matrix models (43) based on a nite number of degrees of freedom, is the
same as for the supermembrane. among the zero-energy states there are those
where the matrices take a block-diagonal form, which can be regarded as a direct
product of states belonging to lower-rank matrix models [14]. the fact that the
moduli space of ground states, whose nature is protected by supersymmetry at
the quantum-mechanical level, is isomorphic to r9n /sn , is already indicative of
a corresponding description in terms of an n-particle fock space.

the nite-n matrix models have an independent interpretation in string the-
ory. strings can end on certain defects by means of dirichlet boundary condi-
tions. these defects are called d-branes (for further references, see [30]). they
can have a p-dimensional spatial extension and carry ramond-ramond charges
[31]. d-branes play an important role in the nonperturbative behaviour of string
theory. the models of this section are relevant for d0-branes (dirichlet parti-
cles). the eective short-distance description for d-branes can be derived from
simple arguments [13]. as the strings must be attached to the p-dimensional
branes, we are dealing with open strings whose endpoints are attached to a p-
dimensional subspace. at short distances, the interactions caused by these open
strings are determined by the massless states of the open string, which constitute
the ten-dimensional yang-mills supermultiplet, propagating in a reduced (p + 1)-
dimensional spacetime. because the endpoints of open strings carry chan-paton
factors the eective short-distance behaviour of n d-branes can be described in
terms of a u(n) ten-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory reduced to the
(p+1)-dimensional world volume of the d-brane. the u(1) subgroup is associated
with the center-of-mass motion of the n d-branes.

in the type-iia superstring one has dirichlet particles moving in a 9-dimensional

space. as the world volume of the particles is one-dimensional (p = 0), the short-
distance interactions between these particle is thus described by the model of
section 1 with gauge group u(n) and d = 9. the continuous spectrum without
gap is natural here, as it is known that, for static d-branes, the ramond-ramond
repulsion cancels against the gravitational and dilaton attraction, a similar phe-
nomenon as for bps monopoles. with this gauge group the coordinates can be
described in terms of n n hermitean matrices. the valley congurations corre-
spond to the situation where all these matrices can be diagonalized simultanously.
the eigenvalues then dene the positions of n d-particles in the 9-dimensional
space. as soon as one or several of these particles approach each other then the
[u(1)]n symmetry that is left invariant in the valley, will be enhanced to a non-
abelian subgroup of u(n). clearly there are more degrees of freedom than those
corresponding to the d-particles, which are associated with the strings stretching
between the d-particles. as we alluded to above the model naturally incorporates
congurations corresponding to widely separated clusters of d-particles, each of
which can be described by a supersymmetric quantum-mechanics model based
on the product of a number of u(k) subgroups forming a maximal commuting
subgroup of u(n). when all the d-particles move further apart this corresponds

17

to congurations deeper and deeper into the potential valleys. these d-particles
thus dene an independent perspective on the models introduced in this section,
which can be used to study their dynamics. we refer to [32] for work along these
lines.

the study of d-branes was further motivated by a conjecture according to
which the degrees of freedom of m-theory are fully captured by the u(n) super-
matrix models in the n   limit [14]. the elusive m-theory is dened as the
strong-coupling limit of type-iia string theory and is supposed to capture all the
relevant degrees of freedom of all known string theories, both at the perturbative
and the nonperturbative level [9, 10].
in this description the various string-
string dualities are fully incorporated. at large distances m-theory is described
by 11-dimensional supergravity. a direct relation between supermembranes and
type-iia string theory was emphasized in [9], based on the relation between ex-
tremal black holes in 10-dimensional supergravity [33] and the kaluza-klein states
of 11-dimensional supergravity in an s1 compactication. in this compactica-
tion the kaluza-klein photon coincides with the ramond-ramond vector eld
of type-iia string theory. therefore kaluza-klein states are bps states whose
ramond-ramond charge is proportional to their mass. hence they have the
same characteristics as the dirichlet particles. from this correspondence with
the kaluza-klein spectrum one may infer that the corresponding matrix models
must possess zero-energy bound states, whose existence was indeed established
in [15]. furthermore, the eective interaction between innitely many dirichlet
particles must lead to a theory that is identical to that of an elementary superme-
mbrane. there are alternative compactications of m-theory which make contact
with other string theories. supermembranes have been used to provide evidence
for the duality of m-theory on r10  s1/z2 and 10-dimensional e8  e8 heterotic
strings [11]. finally let us mention the so-called double-dimensional reduction of
membranes, which is a truncation that leads to fundamental strings [34]. whether
this truncation remains relevant in the context of the full supermembrane theory
is an open question.

6 membranes and matrix models in curved space

so far we considered supermembranes moving in a at target superspace. their
description follows from substituting the at superspace expressions (2) into the
supermembrane action (1). however, these expressions can also be evaluated for
nontrivial backgrounds, such as those induced by a nontrivial target-space metric,
a target-space tensor eld and a target-space gravitino eld, corresponding to the
elds of (on-shell) 11-dimensional supergravity. this background can in principle
be cast into superspace form by a procedure known as gauge completion [35].
for 11-dimensional supergravity, the rst steps of this procedure were carried
out long ago [36] and recently the results were determined to second order in the

18

fermionic coordinates  [37].

to elucidate the generic eects of nontrivial backgrounds for membrane the-
ories, let us conne ourselves for the moment to the purely bosonic theory and
present the light-cone formulation of the membrane in a background consisting
of the metric g and the tensor gauge eld c. in the subsequent sections we
will include the fermionic coordinates. the lagrangian density for the bosonic
membrane follows directly from (1),

l = g  1

6 ijkix  jx  kx  c ,

(48)

where gij = ix  jx  .
in the light-cone formulation, the coordinates are
decomposed in the usual fashion as (x +, x , x a) with a = 1 . . . 9. furthermore
we use the dieomorphisms in the target space to bring the metric in a convenient
form [39],

g = ga = 0 .

(49)

just as for a at target space, we identify the time coordinate of the target space
with the world-volume time, by imposing the condition x + =  . moreover we
denote the spacesheet coordinates of the membrane by r, r = 1, 2. following
the same steps as for the membrane in at space [4], one arrives at a hamiltonian
formulation of the theory in terms of coordinates and momenta. these phase-
space variables are subject to a constraint, which takes the same form as for the
membrane theory in at space, namely,

r = pa rx a + p rx   0 .

(50)

of course, the denition of the momenta in terms of the coordinates and their
derivatives does involve the background elds, but at the end all explicit depen-
dence on the background cancels out in the phase-space constraints.

the total hamiltonian now follows straightforwardly and is equal to

h = z d2(cid:26) g+

p  c(cid:20) 1
p  c

2 g+

p  c

ga+(cid:17)2

4(rs rx a sx b)2(cid:21)

(51)

where we have included the lagrange multipliers cr coupling to the constraints
(50). observe that transverse indices are contracted with the metric gab or its
inverse. furthermore we have made use of the folowing denitions,

ca = rsrx sx b cab + 1
2 rsrx asx b cab ,
c = 1
c+ = rsrx sx a c+a .

2rsrx bsx c cabc ,

(52)

the gauge choice x + =  still allows for  -dependent reparametrizations
of the world-space coordinates r, which in turn induce transformations on the

19

lagrange multiplier cr through the hamilton equations of motion. in addition
there remains the freedom of performing tensor gauge transformations of the
target-space three-form c. in order to rewrite (51) in terms of a gauge theory
of area-preserving dieomorphisms it is desirable to obtain a hamiltonian which is
polynomial in momenta and coordinates. for this the dynamics of pc needs
to become trivial, i.e.  (p c) = 0, allowing us to set it equal to some space-
sheet density qw(). the residual invariance group is then constituted by the
area-preserving dieomorphisms that leave w invariant. the  -independence
of p  c can be achieved by rstly assuming that the background elds are
x -independent. secondly one uses the tensor gauge transformations to set cab
equal to a constant antisymmetric matrix. one then has

 (p  c)  rhrssx a c+a + (p  c) cri .

(53)

we now choose a gauge such that the right-hand side of this equation vanishes.
in that case the total hamiltonian takes the following form,

h = z d2(cid:26) g+

4(rs rx a sx b)2(cid:21)

(54)

where p  c  w and cab constant.

at this point one can impose further gauge choices and set g+ = 1 and
c+a = 0. taking also cab = 0 the corresponding hamiltonian can be cast in
lagrangian form in terms of a gauge theory of area-preserving dieomorphisms
[40],

2 (d0x a)2 + d0x a(cid:16) 1

2c+ab{x a, x b} ,

2g++ + 1

(55)

where the covariant derivatives were introduced in section 3. for convenience
we have set (p)0 = 1. in the case of compact dimensions, it may not always
be possible to set c+a and cab to zero, although they can be restricted to
constants. one can then follow the same procedure as above. as alluded to
in the rst reference of [17], the lagrangian then depends explicitly on x , a
feature that was already exhibited earlier for the winding membrane (cf. (26).
however, in the case at hand, the constraint makes the resulting expression for x 
extremely nontrivial. this is clearly an issue that deserves more study. recently
the antisymmetric constant matrix cab was conjectured to play a role for the
matrix model compactication on a noncommutative torus [17].
it should be
interesting to see what the role is of (54) in this context.

20

with a reformulation of the membrane in background elds as a gauge the-
ory of area-preserving dieomorphisms at ones disposal, one may consider its
regularization through a matrix model by truncating the mode expansion for co-
ordinates and momenta along the lines explained in section 4. this leads to a
replacement of poisson brackets by commutators, integrals by traces and prod-
ucts of commuting elds by symmetrized products of the corresponding matri-
ces. at that point the original target-space covariance is aected, as the matrix
reparametrizations in terms of symmetrized products of matrices do not possess
a consistent multiplication structure; this is just one of the underlying diculties
in the construction of matrix models in curved space [16]. finally, one may now
study interactions between membranes by considering the behaviour of a test
membrane in a background eld induced by another membrane [41].

7 supergravity in 11 dimensions

before moving to the more general superspace backgrounds associated with su-
pergravity in 11 spacetime dimensions, we give a brief summary of this theory in
r,
order to establish our conventions. the theory is based on an elfbein eld e
a majorana gravitino eld  and a 3-rank antisymmetric gauge eld c. its
lagrangian3 can be written as follows [2],

the lagrangian (56) is derived in the context of the so-called 1.5-order
formalism, in which the spin connection is dened as a dependent eld determined
by its (algebraic) equation of motion, whereas its supersymmetry variation in the
action is treated as if it were an independent eld [42]. furthermore we note the
presence of a chern-simons-like term f  f  c in the lagrangian. under tensor
gauge transformations,
(61)

the corresponding action is thus only invariant up to surface terms.

when the third equation of (62) and (63) receive contributions from certain source
terms on the right-hand side, then the corresponding charges can be associated
with the ux-integral of h1...7 and f1234 over the boundary of an 8- or a
5-dimensional spatial volume, respectively. this volume is transverse to a p = 2
and p = 5 brane conguration, and the corresponding charges are 2- and 5-rank
lorentz tensors. for solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity that contribute to
these charges, see e.g. [44, 45, 46, 9].

it is straightforward to evaluate the supersymmetry algebra on these elds.
the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations yields a general-coordi-
nate transformation, a supersymmetry transformation, a local lorentz transfor-
mation, and a gauge transformation associated with the tensor gauge eld,

ity in 11 spacetime dimensions, we briey introduce the method for constructing
superspace backgrounds in terms of these component elds. at the end of this
section we present the superspace quantities of interest to second order in the
anticommuting coordinates  [37]. the superspace geometry with coordinates
z m = (x, ) is encoded in the supervielbein em
a and a spin-connection eld
ab. in what follows we will not pay much attention to the spin-connection,
m
which is not an independent eld. furthermore we have an antisymmetric tensor
gauge eld bm n p , subject to tensor gauge transformations,

bm n p = 3 [m n p ] .

(67)

unless stated otherwise the derivatives with respect to  are always left deriva-
tives.

under superspace dieomorphisms corresponding to z m  z m + m (z), the

super-vielbein and tensor gauge eld transform as

the superspace that we are dealing with is not unrestricted but is subject
to certain constraints and gauge conditions. furthermore, we will not describe
an o-shell situation as all superelds will be expressed entirely in terms of the
r,
three component elds of on-shell 11-dimensional supergravity, the elfbein e

23

the antisymmetric tensor gauge eld c and the gravitino eld . as a re-
sult of these restrictions the residual symmetry transformations are conned to
11-dimensional dieomorphisms with parameters (x), local lorentz transfor-
mations with parameters rs(x), tensor-gauge transformations with parameters
(x) and local supersymmetry transformations with parameters (x). to de-
rive how the superelds are parametrized in terms of the component elds it is
necessary to also determine the form of the superspace transformation parame-
ters, m , rs and m n , that generate the supersymmetry transformations. here
it is important to realize that we are dealing with a gauge-xed situation. for
that reason the superspace parameters depend on both the x-dependent com-
ponent parameters dened above as well as on the component elds. this has
two consequences. first of all, local supersymmetry transformations reside in the
superspace dieomorphisms, the lorentz transformations and the tensor gauge
transformations, as m , rs and m n are all expected to contain -dependent
terms. thus, when considering supersymmetry variations of the various elds,
one must in principle include each of the three possible superspace transforma-
tions. secondly, when considering the supersymmetry algebra, it is crucial to also
take into account the variations of the component elds on which the parameters
m , rs and m n will depend.

the method of casting component results into superspace has a long history
and is sometimes called gauge completion. for results in 4 spacetime dimensions
we refer the reader to [35], while results in 11 dimensions in low orders of  were
presented in [36, 37](see also [38]). here we will follow [37] where results were
obtained to second order in . there are two, somewhat complimentary, ways to
obtain information on the embedding of component elds in superspace geometry.
one is to consider the algebra of the supersymmetry transformations as generated
by the superspace transformations and to adjust it to the supersymmetry algebra
of the component elds. this determines the superspace transformation param-
eters. the other is to compare the transformation rules for the superelds with
the known transformations of the component elds. this leads to a parametriza-
tion of both the superelds and the transformation parameters in terms of the
component elds and parameters. the evaluation proceeds order-by-order in the
-coordinates, but at each level one encounters ambiguities which can be xed by
suitable higher-order coordinate redenitions and gauge choices. the rst step
in this iterative procedure is the identication at zeroth-order in  of some of the
component elds and transformation parameters with corresponding components
of the supereld quantities. the underlying assumption is that this identica-
tion can always be implemented by choosing an appropriate gauge. an obvious

24

identication is given by [47, 48, 35, 36],

r(x,  = 0) = e
a(x,  = 0) = 

r(x) ,
e
a(x) ,
e
b(x,  = 0) = c(x) ,

(x,  = 0) = (x) ,
(x,  = 0) = (x) ,
rs(x,  = 0) = rs(x) ,
(x,  = 0) = (x) .

(71)

as was explained above, the component supersymmetry transformations with
parameters (x) are generated by a linear combination of a superspace dieomor-
phism, a local lorentz and a tensor gauge transformation; their corresponding
parameters will be denoted by m (), rs() and m n (), respectively. given
the embedding of the component elds into the superelds, application of these
specic superspace transformations should produce the very same transformation
rules that were dened directly at the component level in the previous section.
the structure of the commutator algebra of unrestricted innitesimal superspace
transformations is obvious. two dieomorphisms yield another dieomorphism,
two lorentz transformations yield another lorentz transformation, according to
the lorentz group structure, while two tensor transformations commute. on the
other hand, a dieomorphism and a local lorentz transformation yield another
lorentz transformation, and a dieomorphism and a tensor gauge transformation
yield another gauge transformation. all other combinations commute.

for further details we refer to [37] and we proceed directly to the results. for

then we turn to some of the transformation parameters. the supersym-
metry transformations consistent with the elds specied above, are generated
by superspace dieomorphisms, local lorentz transformations and tensor gauge
transformations. the corresponding parameters are as follows. the superspace
dieomorphisms are expressed by

() =        + o(3) ,

9 the supermembrane in a nontrivial background

the initial supermembrane action (1) is manifestly covariant under independent
superspace dieomorphisms, tangent-space lorentz transformations and tensor
gauge transformations. for the specic superspace elds associated with 11-
dimensional on-shell supergravity that we presented in the previous section, this
is no longer true and one has to restrict oneself to the superspace transforma-
tions corresponding to the component supersymmetry, general-coordinate, local
lorentz and tensor gauge transformations. when writing (1) in components, uti-
lizing the expressions found in the previous sections, one thus obtains an action
that is covariant under the restricted superspace dieomorphisms (74) acting on
the superspace coordinates z m = (x , ) (including the spacetime arguments
of the background elds) combined with usual transformations on the component

26

elds (we return to this point shortly). note that the result does not constitute
an invariance. rather it implies that actions corresponding to two dierent sets
of background elds that are equivalent by a component gauge transformation,
are the same modulo a reparametrization of the supermembrane embedding co-
ordinates. in order to be precise let us briey turn to an example and consider
the action of a particle moving in a curved spacetime background with metric
g,

(78)

s[x , g(x)] = mz dt qg(x(t)) x (t) x (t) .
this action, which is obviously invariant under world-line dieomorphisms, satis-
es s[x  , g
(x )] = s[x , g(x)], where x   and x  are related by a target-
space general coordinate transformation which also governs the relation between
g
 and g. of course, when considering a background that is invariant under
(a subset of the) general coordinate transformations (so that g = g), then the
action will be invariant under the corresponding change of the coordinates. this
is the situation that we will address in the next section, where we take a specic
background metric with certain isometries. in that context the relevant target
space for (78) is an anti-de-sitter (adsd) space, which has isometries that con-
stitute the group so(d  1, 2), where d is the spacetime dimension. then (78)
describes a one-dimensional eld theory with an so(d1, 2) invariance group. in
the particular case of d = 2 this invariance can be re-interpreted as a conformal
invariance for a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system.4

using the previous results one may now write down the complete action of the
supermembrane coupled to background elds up to order 2. direct substitution
leads to the following result for the supervielbein pull-back,

r

i = ix (cid:16)e

(79)

consequently the induced metric is known up to terms of order 3. furthermore
the pull-back of the tensor eld equals

4this situation arises generically for any p-brane moving in a target space that is locally the
product of adsp+2 and some compact space. the conformal interpretation was emphasized in
[49]

3ijkix  jx h4  k    2  k  i + o(3) ,

(80)

where we have introduced the abbreviation dx  = ijk ix  jx  kx  for the
world-volume form. observe that we included also the terms of higher-order
-terms that were determined in previous sections and listed in (73). the rst
formula of (79) and (80) now determine the supermembrane action (1) up to
order 3.

as an illustration of what we stated at the beginning of this section, one may
consider the eect of the superspace dieomorphisms (74) on a
i . we only need
the variations to rst order in , so that we substitute x   x  +  and
   +      into (79). for r
i this induces a variation which can be
rewritten as

r

(81)

i = ix he

r + 2 ri  rs() s

i + o(2) .
the rst term on the right-hand side represents the change of r
i under the super-
symmetry variations (58) of the background elds. the second term represents a
lorentz transformation whose parameter is given by (75). for the induced met-
ric, given by gij = r
j rs, the lorentz transformation drops out, so that the
eect of the coordinate change of (x , ) is the same as when performing a su-
persymmetry transformation of the background elds. this implies that the rst
term in the supermembrane action (1) has indeed the required transformation
behaviour.

i s

a similar result holds for the variation of a

i under the coordinate change as
well as for the pull-back of the tensor eld. again we refrain from giving further
details, but refer instead to [37].

while the above results were guaranteed to hold on the basis of the procedure
followed in the previous section, the -invariance of the action is an independent
issue. the -symmetry transformations are dened in the unrestricted super-
space and will be given below. in principle, it should be possible to derive the
transformation rules in the gauge-xed superspace situation that we are working
with. however, it is not necessary to do so, because we are only interested in
establishing the invariance of the action. both the original and the gauge-xed
action should be -symmetric, so that we can just use the original superspace
dieomorphisms corresponding to -symmetry and substitute them in the gauge-
xed action. these -transformations take the form of superspace coordinate
changes dened by [1]

z m em

r = 0 ,

a = (1  )a

where a() is a local fermionic parameter and the matrix  is dened by

(84)

therefore the matrix (1  ) in (82) is a projection operator. as a consequence,
this allows one to gauge away half of the  degrees of freedom. with these
denitions one can prove that the action is invariant under local -symmetry
in the appropriate order in , up to a world-volume surface term which is a
generalization of (6). at this level in  there are as yet no constraints on the
background. these constraints will be required in higher orders of  and will
take the form of the supergravity eld equations. again we refer to [37] for
details.

10 near-horizon geometries

in the previous section we discussed the determination of superspace quantities,
i.e. the superspace vielbein and the tensor gauge eld, in terms of the elds of 11-
dimensional on-shell supergravity. the corresponding expressions are obtained
by iteration order-by-order in  coordinates, but except for the leading terms
it is hard to proceed with this program. nevertheless these results enable one
to write down the 11-dimensional supermembrane action coupled to a nontrivial
supergravity component-eld background to second order in , so that one can
start a study of the supermembrane degrees of freedom in the corresponding
background geometries. in analogy to the bosonic case discussed in section 6, the
light-cone supermembrane turns out to be equivalent to a gauge theory of area-
preserving dieomorphisms coupled to background elds, modulo corresponding
assumptions on the background geometry. this u() gauge theory may then
in turn be regularized by a supersymmetric u(n) quantum-mechanical model in
curved backgrounds with a certain degree of supersymmetry. whether or not
this will shed some light on the problem of formulating matrix models in curved
spacetime is at present still an open question, as we have already been alluding
to in section 6.

however, in specic backgrounds with a certain amount of symmetry, it is
possible to obtain results to all orders in . interesting candidates for such back-
grounds are the membrane [44] and the ve-brane solution [45] of 11-dimensional
supergravity, as well as solutions corresponding to the product of anti-de-sitter
spacetimes with compact manifolds [18]. coupling to the latter solutions, which
appear near the horizon of black d-branes [33], seem especially appealing in
view of the recent results on a connection between large-n superconformal eld
theories and supergravity on a product of ads space with a compact manifold
[19]. the target-space geometry induced by the p-branes interpolates between
adsp+2  b near the horizon, where b denotes some compact manifold (usually

29

a sphere), and at (p + 1)-dimensional minkowski space times a cone with base
b.

this program has been carried out recently for the type-iib superstring and
the d3-brane in a iib-supergravity background of this type [56, 57, 59].
in
the context of 11-dimensional supergravity the ads4  s7 and ads7  s4 back-
grounds stand out as they leave 32 supersymmetries invariant [50, 51]. these
backgrounds are associated with the near-horizon geometries corresponding to
two- and ve-brane congurations and thus to possible conformal eld theories
in 3 and 6 spacetime dimensions with 16 supersymmetries, whose exact nature
is not yet completely known. in this section we consider the supermembrane in
these two backgrounds [52]. as the corresponding spaces are local products of
homogeneous spaces, their geometric information can be extracted from appropri-
ate coset representatives leading to standard invariant one-forms corresponding
to the vielbeine and spin-connections. the approach of [52] diers from that
of [53], which is also discussed at this conference; in the latter one constructs
the geometric information exploiting simultaneously the kappa symmetry of the
supermembrane action, while in [52] the geometric information is determined
independently from the supermembrane action. the results for the geometry
coincide with those of [54].

as is well known, the compactications of the theory to ads4s7 and ads7
s4 are induced by the antisymmetric 4-rank eld strength of m-theory. these
two compactications are thus governed by the freund-rubin eld f , dened by
(in pauli-kallen convention, so that we can leave the precise signature of the
spacetime open),

f = 6f e  ,

(85)

with e the vierbein determinant. when f is purely imaginary we are dealing with
an ads4s7 background while for real f we have an ads7s4 background. the
nonvanishing curvature components corresponding to the 4- and 7-dimensional
subspaces are equal to

r = 4f 2(g g  g g) ,
r  = f 2(g g   g g ) .

(86)

here , , ,  and , , ,  are 4- and 7-dimensional world indices, respec-
tively. we also use m4,7 for the inverse radii of the two subspaces, dened by
|f|2 = m7
2. the killing-spinor equations associated with the 32 super-
symmetries in this background take the form

2 = 1

4m4

(cid:16)d  f 5  1(cid:17) = (cid:16)d + 1

2f 1  

(cid:17) = 0 ,

(87)

where we make use of the familiar decomposition of the (hermitean) gamma ma-
trices  and 
, appropriate to the product space of a 4- and a 7-dimensional

30

subspace (see [52]). here d and d denote the covariant derivatives contain-
ing the spin-connection elds corresponding to so(3,1) or so(4) and so(7) or
so(6,1), respectively.

the algebra of isometries of the ads4  s7 and ads7  s4 backgrounds is
given by osp(8|4; r) and osp(6, 2|4). their bosonic subalgebra consists of so(8)
sp(4)  so(8) so(3, 2) and so(6, 2) usp(4)  so(6, 2) so(5), respectively. the
spinors transform in the (8, 4) of this algebra. observe that the spinors transform
in a chiral representation of so(8) or so(5).

one may decompose the generators of osp(8|4) or osp(6, 2|4) in terms of irre-
ducible representations of the bosonic so(7)  so(3, 1) and so(6, 1)  so(4) sub-
algebras. in that way one obtains the bosonic (even) generators pr, mrs, which
generate so(3, 2) or so(5), and pr, mrs, which generate so(8) or so(6, 2). all
the bosonic generators are taken antihermitean (in the pauli-kallen sense). the
fermionic (odd) generators qaa are majorana spinors, where we denote the spino-
rial tangent-space indices by a, b, . . . and a, b, . . . for 4- or 7-dimensional indices.
the commutation relations between even generators are

[pr, ps] = 4f 2mrs ,
[pr, mst] = rs pt  rt ps ,
[mrs, mtu] = ru mst + st mru

[pr, ps] = f 2mrs ,
[pr, mst] = rs pt  rt ps ,

[mrs, mtu] = ru mst + st mru

rt msu  su mrt ,

rt msu  su mrt .
(88)

the odd-even commutators are given by

[pr, qaa] = f (r5)a
[mrs, qaa] =  1
2(rs)a

b qba ,

b qba ,

[pr, qaa] =  1
[mrs, qaa] =  1

2f (
2(

r)a

rs)a

b qab ,
b qab .

(89)

finally, we have the odd-odd anti-commutators,

{qaa, qbb} = (5c)ab(cid:16)2(

rc )ab p r

 f (

rsc )ab m rs(cid:17)

c 

ab(cid:16)2(rc)ab p r + 2f (rs5c)ab m rs(cid:17).

(90)

all other (anti)commutators vanish. the normalizations of the above algebra
were determined by comparison with the supersymmetry algebra in the conven-
tions of [37] in the appropriate backgrounds.

however, one can return to 11-dimensional notation and drop the distinction
between 4- and 7-dimensional indices so that the equations obtain a more com-
pact form. in that case the above (anti)commutation relations that involve the
supercharges can be concisely written as,

[pr, q] = q tr
stuvfstuv ,
{q, q} = 2r p r + 1

[mrs, q] = 1
2

q rs ,

144hrstuvwftuvw + 24 tuf rstuimrs ,

(91)

31

where the tensor t is was dened in (59). note, however, that the above formulae
are only applicable in the background where the eld strength takes the form
given in (85). in what follows, we will only make use of (91).

11 coset-space representatives of ads4  s7 and

ads7  s4

both backgrounds that we consider correspond to homogenous spaces and can
thus be formulated as coset spaces [55]. in the case at hand these (reductive) coset
spaces g/h are osp(8|4; r)/so(7)so(3, 1) and osp(6, 2|4)/so(6, 1)so(4).
to each element of the coset g/h one associates an element of g, which we denote
by l(z). here z a stands for the coset-space coordinates xr, a (or, alternatively,
xr, yr and aa). the coset representative l transforms from the left under
constant g-transformations corresponding to the isometry group of the coset
space and from the right under local h-transformations: l  l = g l h1.
ned through5

the vielbein and the torsion-free h-connection one-forms, e and , are de-

where

dl + l  = l e ,

the integrability of (92) leads to the maurer-cartan equations,

(94)

where we suppressed the spinor indices on the anticommuting component ea.
the rst equation in a fermion-free background reproduces (86) upon using the
commutation relations (88).

now the question is how to determine the vielbeine and connections to all
orders in  for the spaces of interest. first, observe that the choice of the coset
representative amounts to a gauge choice that xes the parametrization of the
coset space. we will not insist on an explicit parametrization of the bosonic part
of the space.
it turns out to be advantageous to factorize l(z) into a group
element of the bosonic part of g corresponding to the bosonic coset space, whose
parametrization we leave unspecied, and a fermion factor. hence one may write

l(z) = (x) l() ,

(95)
5a one-form v stands for v  dz ava and an exterior derivative acts according to dv 

dz b  dz a avb. fermionic derivatives are thus always left-derivatives.

with l() = exp[ q ] .

32

there exists a convenient trick [56, 57, 58] according to which one rst rescales
the odd coordinates according to   t , where t is an auxiliary parameter that
we will put to unity at the end. taking the derivative with respect to t of (92)
then leads to a rst-order dierential equation for e and  (in 11-dimensional
notation),

e   = d q + (e  ) q  q (e  )

(96)

after expanding e and  on the right-hand side in terms of the generators and
using the (anti)commutation relations (91) we nd the coupled rst-order linear
dierential equations,

this information can now be substituted into the rst part of the super-
membrane action (1). by similar techniques one can also determine the wess-
zumino-witten part of the action by rst considering the most general ansatz
for a four-form invariant under tangent-space transformations. using the lowest-
order expansions of the vielbeine (101) and comparing with [37] shows that only
two terms can be present. their relative coecient is xed by requiring that
the four-form is closed, something that can be veried by making use of the
maurer-cartan equations (94). the result takes the form

f(4) =

1

4!her  es  et  eufrstu  12 e  rse  er  esi .

(102)

to establish this result we also needed the well-known quartic-spinor identity in 11
dimensions. the overall factor in (102) is xed by comparing to the normalization
of the results given in [37].

because f(4) is closed, it can be written locally as f(4) = db. the general
solution for b can be found by again exploiting the one-forms with rescaled 
coordinates according to   t  and deriving a dierential equation. using the
lowest order result for b this equation can be solved and yields

b = 1

6 er  es  et crst z 1

0

dt  rse  er  es ,

(103)

where the vielbein components contain the rescaled s. this answer immediately
reproduces the at-space result upon substitution of frstu = rs = 0.

in order to obtain the supermembrane action one substitutes the above ex-
pressions in the action (1). the resulting action is then invariant under local
fermionic -transformations [1] as well as under the superspace isometries corre-
sponding to osp(8|4) or osp(6, 2|4).
we have already emphasized that the choice of the coset representative amounts
to adopting a certain gauge choice in superspace. the choice that was made in
[52] connects directly to the generic 11-dimensional superspace results, written
in a wess-zumino-type gauge, in which there is no distinction between spinorial
world and tangent-space indices. in specic backgrounds, such as the ones dis-
cussed here, gauge choices are possible which allow further simplications. for
this we refer to [57] and other contributions to this volume.

the results of this section provide a strong independent check of the low-
order  results obtained by gauge completion for general backgrounds [37, 36]. a
great amount of clarity was gained by expressing our results in 11-dimensional
language, so that both the ads4s7 and the ads7s4 solution could be covered
in one go. note that in both these backgrounds the gravitino vanishes.
we have no reasons to expect that the 11-dimensional form of our results will
coincide with the expressions for a generic 11-dimensional superspace (with the
gravitino set to zero) at arbitrary orders in .

12 concluding remarks

in this lecture i discussed supermembranes in a variety of situations. closed
supermembranes can live in at spaces, or in superspaces corresponding to su-
pergravity in 11 spacetime dimensions. when the target space has compact di-
mensions there is the possibility of winding. furthermore open supermembranes
exist, though with rather restrictive boundary conditions. in many cases the su-
permembrane theory can be regularized, resulting in a super matrix model based
on a nite number of degrees of freedom. these are the very same models that
describe the short-distance dynamics of d0-branes. a fascinating feature that
these models share is that their hilbert space contains both single-particle and
multi-particle states. for the supermembrane the same feature is present with
respect to states with and without winding.

yet many questions are still open, as was already stressed in the introduction.
for instance, the nature of the supermembrane spectrum is hard to understand.
one could be tempted and conjecture that the supermembrane mass spectrum
(in at space) corresponds simply to the single- and multiple-particle states of
supergravity! at this moment i have no idea how to test the correctness of such
a conjecture. another open issue concerns the large-n limit of the super matrix
models.

on the more technical side it is gratifying that explicit constructions of su-
permembranes in certain nontrivial backgrounds are now possible. the complete
m-theory two-brane action in ads4s7 and ads7s4 to all orders in  represents
a further step in the program of nding the complete anti-de-sitter background
actions for the superstring [56, 57] and the m2-, d3- [59] and m5-branes initiated
for the bosonic part in [49]. furthermore, by studying the interaction between
a test membrane in the background of an m2- or an m5-brane, one may hope
to learn more about the interactions between branes. some of these issues have
already been considered recently [41].

the material of this lecture is by no means complete. for instance, we did not
dicuss matrix strings, nor did we review the matrix-model calculations pertaining
to supergraviton scattering. some of these issues are discussed by other speakers
at this workshop.

acknowledgements: much of the material reported in this lecture resulted from
work done in collaborations with jens hoppe, martin luscher, uli marquard,
hermann nicolai, kasper peeters, jan plefka and alex sevrin during the past
ten years. i thank them for pleasant and stimulating interactions. i also thank
tom banks, jan de boer, michael douglas, michael green, bernard julia, renata
kallosh, hirosi ooguri, matthias staudacher, kelly stelle and paul townsend for
valuable comments and discussions during the past few years.
