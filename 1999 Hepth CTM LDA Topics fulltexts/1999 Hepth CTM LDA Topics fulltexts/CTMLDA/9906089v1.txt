abstract.

we show that the requirements of renormalizability and
physical consistency imposed on perturbative interactions of massive vectorme-
sons x the interactions essentially uniquely i.e. the physical particle content
together with renormalizability determines the theory. in particular physical
consistency requires the presence of at least one additional (scalar) degree of
freedom which was not part of the originally required physical particle content.
in its simplest realization (probably the only one) this is a scalar eld as envis-
aged by higgs but without the higgs condensate. the result agrees precisely
with the usual quantization of a classical gauge theory by means of the higgs
mechanism. hence the principles of local quantum physics via bohrs corre-
spondence explain the gauge principle as a selection principle among the many
(semi)classical coupling possibilities. the statement that the renormalization
and consistency requirements of spin=1 qft lead to the gauge theory struc-
ture may be viewed as the inverse of t hoofts famous renormalizability proof
in (quantized) gauge theories. we also comment on an alternative ghostfree
formulation which avoids eld coordinates alltogether and is analogous to a
perturbative version of the d=1+1 formfactor program.

introduction

in the development of understanding of the renormalization aspects for spin=1 inter-
actions, the classical concepts of gauge and bre bundles have played a crucial role.
without the closely related higgs mechanism it would be hard to imagine, how in the

stage of qft at the end of the 60ies, the incorporation of the electro-weak interaction
into the framework of renormalizable eld theory could have been achieved. in the
present article we will demonstrate that, although the higgs mechanism via higgs
condensates within the setting of gauge theories is an ecient mnemotechnical de-
vice for the rapid construction of the physical result, it has no direct intrinsic physical
content. contrary to a widespread opinion within the physicists community, there is
no gauge principle in the physical sense or an intrinsic physical meaning for higgs
condensates.

we will show this by constructing the same physical results for interacting mas-
sive vectormesons in a quite dierent way which does not rely on the above concepts.
in our approach based on the well-known real-time causal formulation of perturba-
tive qft, the renormalizability is the basic input requirement and the uniqueness
and its gauge appearance in terms of (quasi)classical approximations are the results;
with other words we would phrase the famous t hooft statement that gauge struc-
ture implies renormalizability the other way around. since quantum theory is more
fundamental than classical, this brings interacting vectormesons into harmony with
bohrs correspondence principle:
it is the quantum theory which tells the classical
which possibility among many couplings involving vectors and lower spin elds) it
has to follow, namely the gauge invariant one.

we would not have gained much, and a cynic might claim that we have replaced
one mystery (the gauge mystery) by another one (the renormalization mystery), but
fortunately, we have some slightly more tangible results to oer. our method brings
into the open the long looming suspicion that the appearance of additional physical
degrees of freedom (the alias higgs particle but without vacuum condensates) is a
necessity, following from perturbative consistency up to second order (no claim outside
of perturbation theory is made!)1. in addition it suggests strongly that the physics of
zero mass theory should be approached from massive vectormesons, the latter being
conceptually (but not analytically) simpler. so as it happens often in physics, the
new aspect does not so much lie in the physical results as such, but rather in the
novel way in which they are obtained and in the interpretation associated with this
derivation.

ever since theories in which vectormesons or higher spin particles became phys-
ically relevant in the late 50ies, there were two points of views to deal with such
problem: to start from the wigner particle picture and stay close to particles and
scattering theory, or to quantize classical gauge eld theory (canonically or by func-
tional integrals) and to make contact with (infra)particles at a later stage. in fact

1unfortunately this is not a structural theorem as e.g. the goldstone theorem or the well-known
necessary appearance of particle creation in scattering processes which have a nontrivial elastic part
in d=3+1, but only a perturbative model dependent statement.

sakurai, who introduced the term yang-mills theory [33], and who wanted to use
quantized classical eld theory for the description of massive vectormesons in strong
interactions, encountered diculties to reconcile the two points of view. in most of
his contributions he therefore took a phenomenological non-geometric point of view.
this was particularly advisable since, as a result of some criticism of pauli, the use
of the yang-mills model for the description of massive vectormesons was cast into
question.

the discovery of the electro-weak theory and the renormalization of yang-mills
theories [24] led to a drastic change of that picture. whereas the rst point of
view, which tried to make the gauge principle for vectormesons pragmatically more
palatable, found some protagonists (lewellyn-smith [30], bell [4], cornwall et al.[10])
mainly in the early days of gauge theories, the gauge or yang-mills point of view
enjoyed general popularity and became the predominant one, irrespective of whether
it could be derived from a more particle dominated on-shell approach or not.

the main reason in favor of the gauge point of view was not only its success in
describing problems of quantum matter coupled to external electromagnetic elds as
well as its esthetical mathematical appeal (which contributed largely to the acquire-
ment of sophisticated knowledge which especially the younger generation of physicists
have about bre-bundles and to some degree also to the popularity it enjoys in math-
ematical circles), but rather the way in which, with some hindsight, it led physicists,
like a guardian angel, into the allegedly safe harbor of renormalizable perturbation
theories. it is probably not exaggerating to say that without its lead, veltman and
t hooft would not have been able to nd the appropriate path into the problem of
spin=1 renormalizability which culminated in t hoofts famous demonstration.

this created, at least for some physicist, the, as we will show in this paper,
somewhat misleading impression that in addition to causality and spectral properties
the general framework of qft needs another principle, namely the gauge principle, for
dealing with interactions. this way of thinking led eventually to the higgs mechanism
for the generation of vectormeson masses from spontaneously broken gauge invariance
through fattening via eating goldstone bosons.

in this paper we propose a more intrinsic alternative framework which produces
the same physical (gauge invariant) results without relying on the guardian angle of
gauge theory but instead solely on the principles of (local quantum physics) (lqp).
it uses a simplied free form of the brs formalism [3] for a cohomological extension of
the wigner representation theory as a mathematically less formal operator substitute
for the faddeev-popov formal arguments [21] on functional representations. this is
motivated by renormalizability within the framework of causal perturbation (for all
practical purposes equivalent to the lagrangian approach); our contention is that
with this proviso renormalizability of interacting massive vectormesons uniquely xes
the theory (including the necessity of containing additional higgs-like matter content)

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

in such a way that its (semi)classical and zero mass limit explains the quantum
origin of the classical gauge concept. we put the word explain in quotation mark,
because it basically reduces it to another not fully understood concept namely renor-
malizability, with which we only feel more comfortable because it occurs on the more
fundamental level of local quantum physics where there is still a future chance for
a more profound understanding. it still possesses unsatisfactory (since nonintrinsic)
formal unphysical features (ghosts) in intermediate steps. a throughout physical
formulation requires to leave the framework of feynmans perturbation in favor of a
more on-shell formalism similar to that of (kramers-kronig) dispersion theory and is
not yet available (section 5)

our approach of course does not contradict the gauge approach if, together with
the higgs mechanism, one considers the gauge formalism as a mnemotechnical rule
which facilitates the construction of that unique (xed by the observable particle
content) massive selnteracting mesons within the renormalizable class (which would
have been unique even without the rule). if the spin=1 theory is xed already by
renormalizability, it does not harm to add an additional computational rule which (at
least for a majority of physicist) allows to speed up the calculation of the physical ob-
jects and creates additional condence by making the relation with classical maxwell
theories more manifest. the gauge point of view becomes potentially harmful only
if one takes it literally as a statement of intrinsic physical meaning and thus substi-
tutes principles of local quantum physics by esthetical requirements from the theory
of bre bundles. we do not negate the crucial historical role which gauge theory via
functional integrals and faddeev-poppov determinants played in the formulation of
renormalization theory for spin=1 objects. however as mentioned already, today we
know how to reformulate this directly as a cohomological extension of the spin=1
wigner particle theory in order to lower the formal operator dimension of free elds
from their physical value 2 to the formal value 1 without loosing their pointlike na-
ture. as will be seen, this allows an alternative formulation for interacting massive
vectormesons.

most physicist have anyhow tacitly accepted the fact that there is only one renor-
malizable coupling of massive vectormesons and that consistency in second order
requires the presence of other physical degrees of freedom. the present treatment
puts this into evidence by dismissing the gauge principle as well as the higgs mech-
anism as superuous in favor of shifting more to the renormalizability principle
since one uses the latter anyhow for the lower spins. the only truly intrinsic property
of the massive case is the schwinger charge screening as converted into a rigorous
theorem by swieca. we prefer to talk about charge liberation in the massless limit
(taking the massive spin=1 theory as a reference) instead of charge screening of the
massive theory (with the charged massless theory as a reference).

in more recent times a similar point of view has been taken up by aste, scharf and

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

5

one of the authors (m.d.) [2]. we feel however that their free perturbative operator
gauge invariance, which is a pure quantum formulation of gauge invariance, is not
really going suciently to the physical heart of the matter in pure massive theories.
we will give preference to a perturbative approach of higher spin interactions using
only the principles within local quantum physics. according to our viewpoint the
above mentioned methods should be taken for what they are: technical shortcuts
which allow to retain the standard perturbative formalism, but not as additions to the
physical principles of local quantum physics. this may be somewhat surprising since
the use of common sense of classical eld theory would suggest that the number of
possibilities of admissable polynomial couplings should increase with spin and internal
multiplicities. this indeed applies up to spin=1/2, but beyond these low spins, the
consistency requirements together with renormalizability takes over and works the
other way around; namely to lower the number of possibilities; and for s>1 we do not
even know if there are any renormalizable theories in the sense of this paper2 .

to the extend that the reader considers those requirements on classical theories
which follow from the more fundamental quantum eld theory (imposing renormal-
izable perturbation) as more basic than those imposed by dierential geometry, the
gauge principle of classical theory is explained in terms of massive vectormeson
renormalizability in qft3. in the following we collect the arguments underlying this
viewpoint. for pedagogical purpose and for reasons of brevity we exemplify our points
in a particular class of theories which are the simplest about which both points of
views can be expected to be applicable, namely selnteracting models of massive
vectormesons.

we want to stress that various aspects of this viewpoint are not new. as was
already mentioned schwinger, in a little noticed paper and some more extensive
published lecture notes [40] thought about a massive phase in qed through the
mechanism of charge screening but without (higgs) vacuum condensates. in order to
make his nonperturbative ideas of (maxwellian interaction= renormalizable) massive
vectormesons more palatable, he invented the 2-dim. schwinger model4. indeed as we
know nowadays, the charge screening mechanism is intrinsic [45], whereas the higgs-
condensate mechanism is a mnemotechnical device going with a certain calculational
approach which easily adapt to our often classical brains, but there is nothing

2in a recent paper scharf and wellmann [46] have shown that there exists no renormalizable

theory for s=2 which satises (the free) perturbative (operator) gauge invariance.

3the minimal electromagnetic substitution law is a physical principle for external electromagnetic
elds and has, outside of canonical quantization, no direct consequence for s=1 massive particle
quantum elds.

4in fact in the lowenstein-swieca treatment of this model there is a chiral condensate (coming
from the -degeneracy), but after the dust has settled, the physical content is described in terms of
a massive free eld only.

physically intrinsic in those condensates, they rather depend totally depend on the
use of the standard prescription. as already mentioned in more recent times a direct
presentation of the massive case within the causal perturbation method without the
spontaneous symmetry terminology has been given by the university of zurich group
[2] (dutsch, scharf and aste). we should mention that the point of view advocated
here (but perhaps not the detailed facts) is probably known to some people within
the community of lqp. it also has been mentioned in the setting of schwingers work
and of general quantum eld theory by one of the authors (b. s) [35]. some aspects
of it appeared in the work of grigore [22].

our presentation is organized as follows. in section 2 we review the causal ap-
proach for massive vectormesons and its simplication as a result of the existence of
a natural fock reference space supplied by scattering theory. our presentation uses a
simplied quadratic brs formalism. as a justication for the introduction of ghost
elds we then describe the apparent clash between renormalizability and the operator
dimension dima = 2 of the free vectormeson operators in the usual causal setting
and its resolution via cohomological extension i.e. the ghost stu (section 3). in the
fourth section we show that the consistency requirements of spin=1 interactions are
so strong that a list of the lowest dimension interpolating physical elds (the ones
which we want to describe in our model as observable particles) not only xes the
form of these elds in terms of the auxiliary classical unphysical elds (which may
be introduced already on the level of wigner representation theory), but it also deter-
mines the form of the interaction density including the necessity of the perturbative
presence of a physical degree of freedom, the alias higgs particle, but now without
its vacuum condensate. the argument is interesting in two aspects. on the one hand
it shows that the particle content via the associated interpolating elds limits the
possibilities of interaction for spin=1 particles much more severely than that of lower
spin particles. secondly it demonstrates the inconsistency of perturbation theory
within the lqp setting without the appearance of an additional physical quantum
object, which by minimality assumption is a scalar particle and agrees with the one
described by the higgs eld.

in the fth section we observe that general structural theorems of qft in theories
with asymptotic completeness assure the existence of lsz-type power series in terms
of the physical fock space operators which in the previous brs-like description were
composites involving unphysical elds (ghosts). however we do not know an iterative
law for the perturbative representation of the coecient functions which parallels the
standard iteration which uses time ordering or retarded products (for the elds). the
general lsz-like identication of coecient functions of local elds involves multiple
commutators of the local eld [39] with the incoming free eld (generalized form-
factors). this scenario still holds, but its specialization to perturbation theory of
physical vectormesons does not lead to the standard o-shell feynman rules in terms

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

7

of the physical incoming elds. the reason for this complication, which prevents
the interchange of computations with the descend to the physical elds, is that the
wick-basis used for writing the latter in terms of linear combinations of composites
(including ghosts) is not a natural basis for the physical elds (i.e. the elds which
commute with the brs charge q).

section 6 contains some remark of where one has to look for, if one wants to have a
ghostfree formulation. in view of the fact that the previous sections have made clear
that ghosts behave in some sense like catalyzers5 in chemistry, this is not an academic
problem but really goes to the root of understanding of renormalizability for higher
spin where the standard causal approach breaks down. we are led to believe that such
an approach must bypass the transition operator s(g) and be on-shell i.e. directly
deal with the on-shell s-matrix and multiparticle formfactors of physical elds. since
such a radical new formulation goes by far beyond the more modest goals set in this
paper, we propose to take up these problems in a future publication.

recently there has been an approach to understand the local observable *-algebras
of nonabelian gauge theories without emphasizing the particle content, which in the
lpq framework is anyhow part of the separate (in the algebraic approach) more dif-
cult representation theory associated with states on the algebra [12]. this approach
was specially aimed at the zero mass theories with infrared problems, because the
method does not require the existence of an adiabatic limit. in that case one cannot
use the scattering theory of the physical particles and the brs operators cannot be
written as bilinear operators in free elds but they receive interacting contributions
in every order. therefore one has to face the more dicult problem of a changing po-
sition of the physical cohomology space inside the extendend space depending on the
perturbative order. whereas in the present case the conceptual (but not necessarily
analytical) simplicity of the massive case (existence of reference fock space dened by
scattering theory) plays an important role and the emphasis lies more on the particle
side, the other approach relies on the dichotomy of algebras and states and the fact
that the local nets of observable algebras do not require the understanding of di-
cult infrared problems; they are rather part of the dicult extraction of the particles
characteristics from the local observable algebras. the present approach is in some
sense inverse in that one starts with the observable particle content and grafts it on
the existing brs-extended framework of causal pertubations. the zero mass limit in
our approach is conceptually complicated because it leads to charge liberation (the
opposite of the schwinger-swieca charge screening) and the decoupling of the phys-
ical consistency (higgs) degree of freedom. those physical matter elds which will

5first one introduces them in order to lower the operator dimension of w to four by decreasing
the dimension of the vectorpotential (+ghosts) from two to one, and then in the cohomological
descend the physical operator dimensions increase again while the ghosts are getting eliminated.

be charged in that limit cannot maintain their pointlike localization, rather it has
to be semiinnite spacelike (mandelstam string-like). the linkage of these various
phenomena generates the hope that by controlling those o-shell infrared problems
which are necessary to implement this picture, one may actually get an insight into
this (even in perturbation theory) notoriously dicult localization structure.

since we only consider the present formalism as transitory on our way towards a
completely ghostfree formulation, we did not try to invest much time in polishing our
sometimes very messy pedestrian calculations.

2. consistent perturbative construction of the s-matrix for

massive gauge fields

the aim of this section is to construct the stuckelberg-bogoliubov-shirkov transition
functional s(g), which is the generating functional for the time-ordered products of
wick polynomials. as most functional quantities this object is not directly observable
but it gives rise to fundamental physical observables as the s-matrix, formfactors
and correlation functions of observable elds. the notation should not be misread as
the s-matrix by which we always mean the scattering operator computed with the
lsz or haag-ruelle scattering theory. our model is that of selnteracting massive
vectormesons. our procedure is related to the one of scharf, aste and the rst author
[2], but similarly to a previous discussion by the other author [36] and to grigore [22]
as well as older articles as lewellyn-smith [30], we simply rely on physical consistency
within the framework of local quantum physics and do not require such technical tools
as operator gauge invariance although they tend to simplify calculations.

using the stuckelberg-bogoliubov-shirkov-epstein-glaser method [6] [19] we make

the following perturbative ansatz for s(g)

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

in

n!z d4x1...d4xn tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn)gj1(x1)...gjn(xn),

g = (gj)g

j=0,

(1)

gj  s(r4), which is a formal power series in g. the unknown tj1...jn are operator
valued distributions 6. they are constructed inductively by means of the following
requirements (strongly inuenced by the general wightman-framework [44]):

(a) specication of the model in rst order : the rst order expressions are
the main input of the construction. they specify the model and must be local:
[tj(x), tk(y)] = 0 for (x  y)2 < 0. we assume that t0(x)  w0(x)  w (x) is the
physically relevant interaction density in fock space (i.e. a poincare covariant scalar
composite described by a wick polynomial). tj  wj, j = 1, ..., g are auxiliary
6for questions concerning domains we refer to [19]. for all operators which appear in sections 2
and 3 there exists a common dense invariant domain d and we restrict all operators to this subspace.

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

interactions. the interaction wj is switched by the space-time dependent coupling
constant gj  s(r4). the physically relevant s-matrix is obtained in the adiabatic
limit: g0  const., gj  0, j = 1, ..., g.
(b) permutation symmetry: due to the ansatz (1) we may require permutation
symmetry

tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) = tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn),

  sn.

(2)

(c) causality:

s(g(1) + g(2)) = s(g(1))s(g(2))

if

j supp g(1)

j  (j supp g(2)

j + v) = .
(3)

this requirement is equivalent to (see the appendix of [18]) 7

tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) = tj1...jl(x1, ..., xl)tjl+1...jn(xl+1, ..., xn)

(4)

if

{x1, ..., xl}  ({xl+1, ..., xn} + v) = .

this means that tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) is a (well-dened) time ordered product of wj1(x1),
..., wjn(xn). hence we use the notation

tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) = t (wj1(x1)...wjn(xn))

(5)

due to the induction with respect to the order n, the tj1...jn are uniquely xed by
causality up to the total diagonal n = {(x1, ..., xn)|x1 = x2 = ... = xn}. the
extension of the tj1...jn to the total diagonal is nonunique.
it is restricted by the
following normalization conditions:

(d) poincare covariance;
(e) unitarity: s(g)1 = s(g) for g = (g0, 0, ..., 0), g0 real valued;
(f) scaling degree: the degree of the singularity at the diagonal, measured in
terms of steinmann scaling degree [42][8]8, may not be increased by the extension.
this ensures renormalizability by power counting if the scaling degree (or mass di-
mension) of all wj is  4. this degree is a tool which is related to weinbergs power
counting.

7the non-trivial part of this equivalence is that in the n-th order expression of (3) only special

testfunctions appear, whereas (4) holds on s(r4n).
8we adopt here the notion scaling degree to operator valued distributions by using the strong
operator topology. note that the scaling degree of a wick monomial agrees with its mass dimension.

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

10

additional normalization conditions must be imposed, if one wants to maintain
further symmetries or relations 9, e.g. discrete symmetries (p,c,t), operator gauge
invariance (29-30) or the eld equations of the interacting elds ((n4) in [12]), which
can be obtained from the functional s(g) (1) by bogoliubovs formula (see sect.4).

the existence of the adiabatic limit restricts the extension additionally: for pure
massive theories epstein and glaser [20] proved that, with correct mass and wave
function (re)normalization the adiabatic limit of the functional s(g) exists in the
strong operator sense and it is this limit which we call s-matrix. more precisely
setting g(x) := (g0(x), 0, ...0) the limit

sn  lim
0

sn(g)

(6)

exists   d, where g0  s(r4), g := g0(0) > 0 is the coupling constant and sn(g)
(sn resp.) denotes the n-th order of the functional s(g) (s-matrix resp.). it follows
that the s-matrix is unitary as an operator valued formal power series in fock space

[20]: s =pn sn, sn  gn, ss = 1 = ss on d.

due to this fact we solely consider models in which all elds are massive. in order
that it makes physically sense to consider the s-matrix, we assume that there are no
unstable physical particles as e.g. the w- and z-bosons in the electroweak theory.

in gauge theories the crucial problem is the elimination of the unphysical degrees
of freedom. in the s-matrix framework this problem turns into the requirement that
the s-matrix induces a well-dened unitary operator on the space of physical states
(this is discussed in detail below). we will see that this condition is very restrictive:
it determines the possible interactions to a large extent.

let us rst consider the free incoming elds. we quantize the free gauge elds

where m is the pauli-jordan distribution to the mass m. the representation of this
*-algebra requires an indenite inner product space. we, therefore, work in a krein
fock space f . we denote the scalar product by (., .) and a+ is the adjoint of a
w.r.t. (., .). let j be the krein operator: j 2 = 1, j + = j. then the indenite inner
product < ., . > is dened by

but (h) does not imply the other statements if q 6 =0.

(s00) = (s00)1,

s+(s) + s0(s0) + s(s+) = 0.

(e) ss = 1 = ss and sker q  ker q (i.e. (s+) = 0 = (s0)).
(f) ss = 1 = ss and [q, s]|ker q = 0.

to show that (h) does not imply the other statements for q 6 =0 ( ran q 6 =0 
ran q+ 6 =0), we give two examples for s which satisfy (h) but not (d):
- the condition (h) is invariant under an exchange of q and q+. therefore, there
exists a solution s of (h) which maps ker q+ in ker q+ (and/or ran q+ in ran q+),

perturbative condition which implies [q, s] = 0, namely the

in references [2] physical consistency of the s-matrix is satised by requiring a

free perturbative operator gauge invariance 10: let w  t0 be the inter-

action lagrangian. then there exists w 

1 with

[q, w (x)] = i w 

1 (x)

(29)

and the time ordered products of w and w

[q, t (w (x1)...w (xn))] = i

xl=1

 t (w (x1)...w

(30)

let us assume that (30) holds true to all orders  (n  1). due to the causal
factorization (4) the requirement (30) is then satised away from the total diagonal,
i.e. on s(r4n\n). hence, (30) is an additional normalization condition for t (w...w )
and t (w...w 
1 ...w ). but it is a highly non-trivial task to prove that there exists an
extension to the diagonal which satises (30) and the other normalization conditions
(d), (e) and (f).

in contrast to [q, s] = 0 or [q, s]|ker q = 0, the q-divergence condition (29-30)
makes sense also in models in which the adiabatic limit does not exist, e.g. in mass-
less nonabelian gauge theories. for massless su(n)-yang-mills theories it has been
proved that the q-divergence condition (29-30) (more precisely the corresponding

10the reason for this name stems from the fact that q is the generator of the brst-transformation
of the free incoming elds. for the present purpose we will simply refer to it as the q-divergence
condition for time-ordered products since it has nothing to do with the classical notion of gauge
invariance in the dierential geometric setting of bre bundles, but secures that the true s-matrix
is physical. roughly speaking it is the o shell version of physicality of the on-shell s-matrix.

c-number identities which imply (29-30)) can be satised to all orders [14],[15], and
that these c-number identities imply the usual slavnov-taylor identities [16]. in ad-
dition, (29-30) determines to a large extent the possible structure of the model (see
below). we emphasize that this is a pure quantum formulation of gauge invariance,
without reference to classical physics.

in the present case of pure massive gauge theories (or more generally in gauge
theories in which the strong adiabatic limit (6) of the transition functional s(g) exists)
we proceed in an alternative way. we do not require the q-divergence condition (29-
30) as a new physical principle, instead we simply require physical consistency of the
s-matrix, which means

[q, s]|ker q = 0

(31)

by lemma 1. this is a weaker condition than (29-30). but we will see that it
determines the theory to the same extent. our procedure is similar to grigore [22].11
first we construct the operator q (10) which denes the physical states. for
massless gauge theories the procedure is well-known [29], [13]. the nilpotency of q
gives reason to introduce an anticommuting pair of ghost elds ua, ua for each gauge
eld aa. then we dene12

 a

a(x) 0ua(x)

(32)

turning to massive gauge elds aa (7) we give the ghost elds the same masses

{ua(x), ub(y)} = 0,

{ua(x), ub(y)} = iabma(x  y),

ua = ua,

ua = ua

(33)

11however, there are two mistakes in these papers. it is overlooked that the trilinear terms in
w(0) vanish in the adiabatic limit due to energy-momentum conservation and, hence, in rst order
the condition (31) yields no information about the trilinear terms in w(0) (see appendix a).

by using the terminology introduced below the second mistake can be described as follows: the
higgs eld(s) is/are treated as scalar partner(s) (with arbitrary mass mh  0) of the massless gauge
eld(s), which does/do not appear in q and, hence, is/are physical. by chance this works for the
electroweak theory (there is one massless gauge eld and one higgs eld is needed). but e.g.
in
the present case of pure massive gauge theories, there would be no higgs eld and such a model is
physically inconsistent (31) to second order. this mistake is not made in [2].

12the convergence of this integral (and also of the corresponding expression (36) in the massive

theory) can be shown by using a method of requardt [32],[12].

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

if we insert the massive aa and ua elds into the formula (32) for q the nilpotency
is lost

naive = {qnaive, qnaive} =z d3x z d3y [a

(34)

a(x), a

to restore the nilpotency we proceed as follows: to each gauge eld aa we consider
a scalar eld a with the same mass ma

((cid:3) + m2

a)a = 0,

[a(x), b(y)] = iabma(x  y), a = a

(35)

then, due to [a

a + maa,  a

b (y) + mbb] = 0, the gauge charge

is nilpotent and symmetrical. later we shall see that an additional scalar eld h
with arbitrary mass mh  0 is needed

( a

((cid:3) + m2

h)h = 0,

[h(x), h(y)] = imh (x  y), h = h

(37)

the notation h is reminiscent of the higgs eld, but one with no vacuum conden-
sate (leaving aside the academic point of whether higgs idea would allow for our
terminology): < |h(x)| >= 0, where  denotes the vacuum of the free elds. for
the representation of aa (7), ua, ua (33), a (35) and h (37) in a krein fock space f
and especially the denition of j we refer to [27]13. from the commutation relations

[q, a

a] = iua,

[q, a] = imaua,

{q, ua} = 0,

{q, ua} = i(a

a + maa),

[q, h] = 0

(38)

we conclude that hphys (14) is the linear span of the set of states b1....bl|0 >, l  n0
(|0 > f is the vaccuum), where b1, ...., bl are transversal gauge boson elds (three
polarizations) or h-elds. using this explicit result the positivity assumption (13)
can be veried [27]. we emphasize that h is physical, in contrast to the elds a,
which are sometimes called scalar ghosts. the latter correspond to the stuckelberg
elds.

we are now looking for the possible interactions w  w0 which satisfy the fol-

lowing requirements:

13in [27] it was not realized that the higgs eld is needed and, hence, it is missing there. the

h-eld is represented similarly to the other scalar elds a (with j = 1 in the h-fock space).

(a) w is a wick polynomial in the free incoming elds. each monomial in w has

at least three factors,

l, j  r

(39)

where d
l , kj are restricted by (a)-(e). taking additionally consistency (31) to orders
n  2 into account, it seems that this freedom can be maintained, due to the following
result. it is shown in [17] that the q-divergence condition (30) (which implies (31))
can be satised to all orders (by choosing suitable normalizations) for any (, ),
if the generalized (free perturbative operator) gauge invariance 14 holds true for
(, ) = (0, 0). moreover, under this assumption, one can prove

p0t (w (,)(x1)...w (,)(xn))p0 = p0t (w (0,0)(x1)...w (0,0)(xn))p0 + divergences

(40)

(see [17]) and, hence, the physical s-matrix s00 is independent from (, ).

14the generalized (free perturbative operator) gauge invariance is the following statement. to a

by denition. similarly to (30), the second equation is a normalization condition on the time
ordered products. a proof that it can be satised to all orders is still missing in any nonabelian
model. nevertheless we strongly presume that this statement holds true for all models which are
brst-invariant, especially for the pure massive su (2)-model studied below.

now we make the most general ansatz for w (up to divergence and coboundary

terms ) which satises (a)-(e)

(41)

where fabc, f 1
abc, dabc, eabc, habc, jabc, kab, lab, pab, qab, ra, s  r are arbitrary constants
(which are introduced without any knowledge about a gauge group). from now on we
specialize to the simplest non-trivial model: we consider three selnteracting massive
gauge elds: ma > 0, a = 1, 2, 3 15.

our aim is to determined the parameters in w (41) and the tree normalization
terms (see (49) below) by the consistency condition (31). the hope is that one can
conclude from

0 = [q, sn]|ker q =

in

n!z dx1...dxn [q, t (w (x1)...w (xn))]|ker q

(42)

that [q, t (w (x1)...w (xn))] must be a sum of divergences of local operators and that
then one can follow the calculations in [2].

but there is a diculty at rst order, which is explained in detail in appendix
a. the adiabatic limit of the trilinear terms in w vanishes (except possibly the h-
couplings) due to energy-momentum conservation and in agreement with the fact
that for stable particles there are no s-matrix elements with three particle legs; the
lowest tree contributions involve  4 legs. hence, we get no information about these
terms from [q, s1]|ker q = 0. for the quadrilinear terms w (4) in w the procedure
works (see also appendix a): we obtain that [q, w (4)] must be the divergence of a
wick polynomial. in [22] it is shown that this implies w (4) = 0 except for a term
: h 4 :. but the latter term will be excluded by consistency (31) to second order.
(the well-known : h 4 :-coupling is of second order in g, it appears in the framework
of causal perturbation theory as a tree normalization term of t (w (x1)w (x2)), see
below.)

to determined the parameters in the trilinear terms w (3) of w (41) we compute
the tree diagrams in t (w (3)(x1)w (3)(x2)) (which depend on these parameters) and

15the resulting model is usually called su (2) higgs-kibble model.

it is obtained from the
electroweak theory, which is studied in detail in [2], by setting the weinberg angle w = 0 and
omitting the photon eld, which decouples in this case.

require

z d4x1 d4x2 [q, t (w (3)(x1)w (3)(x2))|tree]|ker q = 0.

19

(43)

we only give a heuristic description of the calculation (a rigorous formulation is still
missing):

 for the terms with x1 6= x2 the t -product factorizes, e.g. for x1 6 x2 + v  we

have

[q, t (w (3)(x1)w (3)(x2))|tree] = [q, w (3)(x1)]w (3)(x2)|tree + w (3)(x1)[q, w (3)(x2))]|tree.
(44)

this makes it plausible that the cancellation of these terms yields the same restrictions
as the q-divergence condition to rst order (29): [q, w (3)] = i w (3) 
for some wick
monomial w (3) 

.16 in this way we obtain

and some relations for kab, lab, pab and qab [2]. there results no restriction on s. one
easily veries that these values of the parameters are not only necessary for (29), they
are also sucient. by absorbing a constant factor in g we obtain

fabc = abc.

(46)

the latter are the structure constants of su(2). so the gauge group structure is not
put in, it comes out as a consequence of physical consistency and the ansatz (41) for
w . for more complicated models (i.e. more than three gauge elds) this conclusion
is impossible at this stage, because one does not know that the fabcs satisfy the jacobi
identity. but then the latter is obtained in the next step (see below). so far it is
possible that all couplings involving the h-eld vanish, i.e. the higgs eld is not yet
needed.

 but the cancellation of the terms with x1 = x2 in (43) cannot be achieved

without h-couplings. this condition yields important results:17

16it is obvious that the q-divergence condition to rst order implies the cancellation of the terms

17these results agree precisely with the ones derived from the q-divergence condition (for second

these tree normalization terms (49) correspond to the quadrilinear terms of order g2
(g denotes the coupling constant) in the interaction lagrangian of the conventional
theory, they have the same inuence on the perturbation series of the s-matrix. the
cancellation of the terms x1 = x2 in (43) xes the possible tree normalization terms
(i.e. the constants c in (49)) uniquely (in terms of s), except for 20

18stora [43] found (for an arbitrary number of massless selnteracting gauge elds) that the q-
divergence condition to rst order implies that the coupling parameters are totally antisymmetric
and that the q-divergence condition for second order tree diagrams yields the jacobi identity.

19the general extension which is poincare covariant (d) and does not increase the scaling degree

(f) reads: f (x1  x2) + cg(x1  x2), c  c arbitrary.
20for the expert we mention that tree normalization terms with b1, ..., b4 exclusively scalar elds
(e.g. nh 4 ) are required. in contrast to the other tree normalization terms (i.e. the tree normalization
terms with gauge eld factors) they violate the normalization condition (n3) in [12] (or (43) in [19]).
but this is no harm.

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

21

so w and the tree diagram normalizations to second order are completely deter-
mined (up to the sign , which is conventional) and these terms agree precisely with
the interaction lagrangian obtained by the higgs mechanism. the higgs potential
is not put in here, it is derived from physical consistency. spontaneous symmetry
breaking plays no role in this approach, because we start with the massive free in-
coming elds. a proof that physical consistency can be satised to all orders (by
choosing suitable normalizations) is missing up to now, but we are convinced that
this holds true.

3. renormalizability and ghosts

the formulation of massive selnteracting vectormesons of the previous section will
now serve as a point of departure for a more fundamental conceptual discussion.
similar to weinberg (weinbergs old work on feynman rules for higher spin) we start
with wigners theory of particle representations; in our case because we want to avoid
any parallelism to (quasi)classical systems (quantization) and (for reasons which will
become gradually clear to the reader) develop local quantum physics from an intrin-
sic point of view as much as possible.
in particular we would like to understand
the curious phenomenon that, contrary to the classical situation, the possibilities
of perturbative renormalizable qft are the more restrictive, the higher the spin.
whereas the classical theory is in need of an additional selection principle (the gauge
principle in case of zero mass), local quantum physics for spin 1 is more restric-
tive: the particle content and renormalizability x the vectormeson theory (where the
possible triviality for spin> 1 is a special case). it is this result red backward into
(quasi)classical eld theory, which, in the spirit of bohrs correspondence principle
gives a fundamental physical support for the classical gauge selection principle (which
then gives the strong link with the mathematical-esthetical appeal to bre bundles).
as a side result we will learn that the massive theory fulls the schwinger-swieca
[40] [45] screening mechanism, and that (similar to the gauge interpretation in terms
of a higgs eld) the theory has more physical degrees of freedom than the massive
vectormesons from which we started in zeroth order, namely consistent perturbation
theory requires the introduction of a scalar h-eld (the higgs eld without higgs
condensate21) of the previous section.

it is well-known that the step from the wigner representation theory of parti-
cles (positive energy irreducible representations of the poincare group with nite

which intertwine the wigner representation matrices d(s)(r(, p)) with matrices of
the covariant lorentz group representation d[n+,n]()

d[n+,n]()u(p) = u(p)d(s)(r(, p))

(53)

where for convenience we have collected the (2s + 1) u(n+,n)(p) mixed (un)dotted
(2n+ +1)(2n+1) component u-spinors into a rectangular (2n++1)(2n+1)(2s+1)
matrix u(p) and similar for the vs.
let us rst note that the covariantized inner product in the one-particle wigner
space for s  1 contains necessarily rst or higher powers of momenta. associated
with this is the fact that the intertwiners u, v have a dimension  1 which immedi-
ately translates into an operator dimension of the eld dim  2. since interaction
densities w0  w are at least trilinear in free elds and since the smallest possible op-
erator dimension is 1 (for scalar elds), it is impossible to satisfy the renormalizability
condition dimw  4 within the stuckelberg-bogoliubov-epstein-glaser operator ap-
proach. inspired by the idea of a cohomological representation of the physical space
and the physical observables in the previous section one looks for a cohomological
extension of the wigner space for massive vectormesons in order that the associ-
ated two-point function (or propagation kernel) has a milder (renormalizable) high
momentum behavior. the results of the previous section also suggest the simplest
possibility to achieve that, namely to use three additional indenite metric scalar
wave functions (where on the wigner level the statistics is yet undetermined).
more precisely we form an extended hilbert space hext by the multicomponent wave
functions (a, , , ) dened on the mass shell. hext has in addition to a positiv
denite inner product another one which does not have this property and correponds
to the krein structure of the previous section. the latter is relevant in order to have
at least some pseudo-unitary lorentz covariance and a denition of modular localized
subspaces. on hext we dene a brs-like operator by

22the letter u, which was used in the previous section for a ghost eld, means here an intertwiner.
the ghost elds in the wigner one-particle space will be denoted by (, , ). the corresponding
fock space elds are the elds (u, u, ) of the previous section.

the so dened sw -operation denes a dierential space since the denition easily
leads to s2
w = 0. one then uses this sw in order to write the following cohomological

i.e. we obtain the l2-closure of the space of transversal vector wave functions which
in terms of the associated elds (52) had the high dimension dima = 2 which was re-
sponsible for the lack of renormalizable interactions within the original (nonextended)
formulation. (the transversality condition does not lower the dimension of the vector
wave functions or the corresponding elds.) on the other hand the extended hilbert
space has no transversality condition and obeys the classical assignment of dimen-
sions (i.e. dima = 1 in hext). this is due to the fact that ghost contributions damp
the high momentum behavior of the associated two-point function.23

the extension has however an inuence on the modular localization theory in
wigner space where the latter is (via the ccr/car functor) the preempted locality
in fock space. for example the wedge (rindler or bisognano-wichmann) localized
subspace involves instead of the simple complex-conjugation in addition the krein
operator  i.e. one has for the action of the pre-tomita operator24

(s)(p) = ()(p).

(56)

where  is the multi-component wave function involving the ghosts in addition to the
vectorpotential. the standard modular localization theory can be found in [35] and

23in the lagrangean framework there is an alternative method to lower the dimension of the gauge
eld a from 2 to 1. in contrast to massless gauge elds, the proca eld (l =  1
2 m2a2, f  
a  a) has a well-dened propagator without introducing a gauge xing term, but it has
dimension dima = 2. stuckelbergs trick is to add a gauge xing term l1 =  1
2 (  a)2,  > 0
(this misleading terminology is chosen because because l1 has the same form as the gauge xing
lagrangean in the massless case), which damps the high momentum behavior of the propagator
such that dima = 1. in this stuckelberg formalism, the necessity to introduce ghosts shows up in
the fact that without ghosts it is impossible to dene a stable physical subspace or factor space.
for  = 1 (feynman gauge) (7) one obtains the same free gauge elds as in the quantization of the
cohomological extension of the wigner one-particle space. we prefer the latter method, because we
do not want to rely on a lagrangean framework, instead we want to be close to the particle picture.
24the pre-tomita operator s has nothing to do with the above nilpotent operators sw (54) (in

4 f 2 + 1

the one particle wigner space) or s (57) in fock space.

24

the adaptation to the present extended pseudo-modular case will be treated in a
separate paper. the physical wigner subspace (more precisely it is a cohomologically
dened factorspace) is precisely characterized by the validity of the correct modular
localization associated with the tomita theory. although our ghost extension of the
(m,s=1) wigner representation is not uniquely xed (we chose a minimal extension)
we believe that any other cohomological extension which also lowers the dima = 2
down to its classical value dima = 1 will contain the minimal and possible additional
pieces which do not change the physical content25.

the next step from particles to elds is the answer to the question of what is
the action of sw on the multiparticle tensor space [11]. from the usual fock space
formalism we are used to the following action of derivations  on tensor products

(1  2) = 1  2 + 1  2

it is easy to see that the tensorproduct action of sw must include a grading in order
to maintain the nilpotency

s(1  2) = s1  2 + 1()degree 1  s2,

(57)

where s denotes the fock space version of sw .26 so, two of the three scalar ghost elds
(u, u, )27, which are companions of each massive vector meson eld, are required to
be graded fermionic elds and the third one must be bosonic.

in this way we obtain the fock space formalism of the previous section with [q,]
being the implementation of s in fock space. whereas the ghost formalism can be
pursued back into the wigner one-particle theory, the necessity to choose trilinear
couplings at rst order in g with coecients fullling group theoretical symmetry, as
well as the necessity of enlargement of the vectormeson setup by additional physical
degrees of freedom (whose simplest and perhaps only realization are the scalar h-
elds) only shows up as a consistency requirement above the zeroth order.

4. determination by field content

in the second section the physical consistency was formulated in terms of the s-
matrix (31). we are now looking for a corresponding condition on the interacting
physical elds. general elds (including composites) are dened in terms of the

25the geometrical faddeev-poppov method can also be considered as a minimal extension of
the functional measure. it owes its unique appearance more to geometric than quantum physical
reasoning.

26from the context it should be clear whether we mean by the letter s the present nilpotent fock

space operator s or the spin.

27we recall that (u, u, ) are the fock space elds of the previous section and correspond to

where a1, ..., an, a are wick polynomials, i c  {1, ..., n} \ i and t denotes the
antichronological product. the corresponding generating functional is s(g)1. the
antichronological products can be obtained uniquely from the time ordered products
by the usual inversion of a formal power series

retarded support with respect to the distinguished coordinate x.

in a pure massive theory the strong adiabatic limit of the interacting elds exists as
a formal power series in g := g0(0):

wj int(x; g0 w ), where

g0 (x)  g0(x),   d,

because this holds true for s(g) (6) [20].

a -symmetrical interacting eld in the adiabatic limit (i.e. int(x)  int(x; w ) =
lim0 int(x; g0 w ), int = int) is called physical (or an observable) if it induces a
well-dened operator on the factor space hphys (22). this holds true i

(the nontrivial part of this statement is that (65) implies int(f ) ran q  ran q.
however, using the notations of sect. 2, the condition (65) is equivalent to int(f )+ =

coecients ck are also involved: ckak = ckak). however, these three requirements
also restrict the normalization of the higher orders of 
a int. it is easy to
see that these additional normalization conditions can be fullled (e.g. by antisym-
metrization in (, ) of an arbitrary poincare covariant extension) and we assume
that the normalizations are always done in such a way.

by denition we may assume vdabc = vdacb.

we require that the interaction density w satises the properties (a)-(f) listed
in section 2, especially dimw  4 which ensures renormalizability. additionally we
assume that w contains no quadrilinear terms. most probably this assumption is
not necessary, i.e. the other requirements (including the physicality (66)) exclude the
quadrilinear terms. but this still needs to be checked and will be left open here.

we now replace the requirement (66) by

[q,f 

a int(x; w )] = 0.

(69)

this may be justied in the following way29. since we are working in the adiabatic
limit our q (36) (constructed in terms of incoming free elds) agrees with the kugo-
ojima operator qint [29], [12] which implements the brst-transformation of the
28by denition the map   int ( a wick monomial) is linear with c-functions as coecients

interacting elds. hence [q,f 
a int(x; w )] is again a local operator. but by the reeh-
schlieder theorem [31] such an operator is zero if it vanishes on the vacuum, which is
an element of the kernel of q. thus the requirements (66) and (69) are equivalent.30

the main (completely new) result of this section is that the physicality (69) xes
the parameters tdab, ..., zda in the ansatz (67) and the interaction w (including the
tree normalization terms to second order (49)) up to the same non-uniqueness as in
section 2, namely the addition of divergence- and coboundary couplings to w (39).
especially we will see that an additional physical degree of freedom is required: the
higgs eld h is needed in the interaction w as well as in the eld f 
d int.

we verify this statement in appendix b by explicit calculation of the tree diagrams
to lowest orders. we do this only for the simplest non-trivial model, namely three
selnteracting massive gauge elds (ma > 0, a = 1, 2, 3) as in section 2. we make
the same ansatz for w as in section 2 , but without the quadrilinear terms. up to
divergence- and coboundary couplings (39) this is the most general trilinear ansatz
which fullls the requirements (a)-(e) of section 2.
the parameters in the ansatz for w and f 
- for w we obtain precisely the same expression as in section 2,
- we have computed the parameters in fint (which are formal power series) up to

d int (67) are determined by inserting
these expressions into the physicality requirement (69). here we only state the results:

to get a better understanding of the latter result we identify these physical elds

(77)

finally some more remarks on the validity of the schwinger-swieca screening
property are in order. since the physical eld strength is an operator in hilbert space
(positive denite metric) which fullls a maxwell type equation and since the particle
spectrum has an isolated mass hyperboloid for the vectormeson, the theorem of swieca
[45] is applicable and hence the charge dened in terms of the large surface integral
over the physical eld strength vanishes. this charge srceening is more interesting if
additional spinor matter is present.

5. renormalizability for s 1 without ghosts?

we have seen that the cohomological representation achieves the magic trick of res-
cuing renormalizability, whereas the naive application of the standard causal pertur-
bation theory based on interactions w in terms of local wick polynomials in physical

31to avoid problems of dening products of interacting elds (this can be done by means of (58))

and the brst-transformation thereof, we only consider classical elds here.

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

30

(wigner) eld coordinates (i.e.
the naive implementation of weinbergs program
of deriving feynman rules from wigners particle theory for higher spin particles),
fails on the count of renormalizability. the trick which rescues the situation, em-
ploys ghosts in intermediate steps, but it does so in a way unaccustomed in basic
physics which is reminiscent of a catalyzer in chemistry. this is to say a physical
problem of perturbativly coupled massive spin =1 free elds interactions, which a
priori has nothing to do with ghosts, had to be cohomologically extended, because
that was apparently the only way to reconcile the standard perturbative machinery
(of deformation of free theories by w s) with the short distance renormalizability
requirement. but at the end, after the cohomological descend, one obtains local
physical vectormeson elds and a physical s-matrix (both renormalizable) within a
physical fock space of massive spin one particles, together with new physical degrees
of freedom. this is certainly a result which totally conceals the intermediate presence
of ghosts. although the nal result agrees formally with (the gauge invariant part
of) renormalized gauge theory, the underlying physical idea and the words used to
describe it are quite dierent. instead of the higgs mechanism, which generates the
s=1 mass through an additionally introduced (by hand) scalar eld with nonvanish-
ing vacuum expectation value, and which has no visible intrinsic (gauge-invariant)
meaning, the vectormeson mass in the present approach is directly linked with the
afore-mentioned schwinger-swieca screening mechanism. the latter, together with
the renormalizability requirement, demands the presence of additional degrees of free-
dom which we realized as scalar particles and identied with the higgs eld without
its vacuum condensate.

although we have neither demonstrated uniqueness of the ghosts nor of the new
physical degree of freedom, we believe, that as already mentioned in the third sec-
tion, our minimal solution is unique in the sense that any other solution involving
higher spin ghost and induced physical objects always contains our minimal solution
(plus possible additional couplings with coupling parameters which may be set to
zero). although the (interacting) physical elds have the same locality and spectral
properties as in a renormalizable s<1 coupling, the operator dimension of the low-
est dimensional eld which interpolates the s=0 and s=1 particles do not have the
usual form of logarithmic corrections on the canonical (free eld) dimensions. rather
they involve higher wick-polynomials up to operator dimension 4. this is the conse-
quence of the fact that the cohomological descend has rendered the standard formulas
in terms of r-products, which were responsible for the canonical dimension + loga-
rithmic corrections, invalid (as a result of the necessity of constructing q-invariant
linear combinations). this rearrangement of the original wick-basis of all elds in
favor of a physical basis (for which the wick-basis becomes unnatural) is the cause
of this problem of mismatch which leads to complicated formulas for the q-invariant
physical basis in terms of the original wick-basis. whereas symmetries of the the-

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

31

ory under quite general conditions can be naturally worked into the renormalization
scheme (so that the renormalized expression in terms of wick-products maintains
its classical appearance), this is apparently not possible for the physical subalgebra.
the reason is that the cohomological descend is a procedure somewhat removed from
(quasi)classical computations. it also indicates that even though the nal physical
degrees of freedom are local and can be described in terms of covariant pointlike
elds, the formalism deviates in some way from the standard local behavior. on a
very formal level (ignoring regularisations of line integrals) we could in fact also have
obtained the lowering of the operator dimension dima from two to one without any
cohomological extension by allowing nonpointlike and noncovariant vectorpotentials
which are interpolating the same particles as the covariant ones. although on-shell
objects as the s-matrix of the nal qft are unaected, as long as those elds remain
almost local in the sense of [23], it is not known how to deal with such objects in a
causal approach based on interaction polynomials w and transition operators s(g).
since the quantization arguments in favor of a gauge theoretical formulation are
usually based on the massless case, let us look at arguments pointing towards non-
pointlike vectorpotentials for (m = 0, h = 1) (m is the mass and h denotes the
helicity) i.e. photons. it is interesting to note that the local quantum theory of free
photons does indeed not allow the introduction of any local covariant vector potential,
thus amplifying the suspicion that spin one interacting theory are somehow less
local than a renormalizable lower spin theory. in order to see this, it is helpful to
briey revisit wigners analysis of semiinteger helicity zero mass irreducible positive
energy representations and their relation to covariant elds where this phenomenon
is visible even before renormalization.

for zero mass the problem with vectorpotentials comes from the noncompact
structure of the little group (stability group) of a lightlike vector say pr = (1, 0, 0, 1),
which is the twofold covering of the euclidean group e(2) (and is denoted by e(2)).
whereas the rotation has the interpretation as a helicity rotation (rotation around the
third axis), the translations are lorentz-transformations which tilt the t-z wedge,
leaving its upper light like vector unchanged. as far as the two transversal coordi-
nates are concerned they behave like 2-parametric galilei velocity transformations
(i.e. light cone translations without the energy positivity property) with the two
longitudinal light cone translations playing the role of the hamiltonian resp.

central mass in the quantum mechanical representation theory of the galilei group.

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

32

of this noncompact group is somewhat more complicated than that of su(2). but
it is obvious that the representations fall into two classes; the neutrino- photon
class with u((, 0)) = 1 i.e. trivial representation of the euclidean translations, and
the remaining faithful continuous spin (innite dimensional) representations with
u((, 0)) 6= 1. a more detailed analysis shows that the latter lacks the strong local-
ization requirements which one must impose on those positive energy representations
which are used for the description of particles.32 hence the wigner theory does not
allow to describe photon operators in terms of covariant vector elds. on the other
hand a covariant eld strength f has the following intertwiner representation in
terms of the wigner annihilation/creation operators for circular polarized photons

 (k) are the polarization vectors which are obtained by application of the fol-

(0,1, i, 0) (which
are  (1, 0, 0, 1)): a rotation of the z-axis into the momentum direction ~n  ~k
 (xed
uniquely by the standard prescription in terms of two euler angles) and a subsequent
lorentz-boost along this direction which transforms (1, ~n) into k = (1, ~n). it is these
vectors that do not behave covariant under those lorentz-transformations which in-
volve the above little group translations but rather produce an ane transformation

(g() is the minkowski space representation of the euclidean translations by (1, 2))
whereas under x-y rotations the e() picks up the standard wigner phase factor. the
polarization vectors do not behave as 4-vectors since they are not invariant under the
euclidean translations in e(2), as one would have expected for a (nonexisting!) bona
de intertwiner from the (0, h = 1) wigner representation to the d[ 1
2 ] covariant
representation. rather the intertwiner only has l-covariance up to additive gauge
transformations i.e. up to ane longitudinal terms. for general lorentz transforma-
tions this ane law reads:

e(1k) + kh(, k)

(82)

32for the nonfaithful representation (m = 0, h = semiinteger) (u ((, 0)) 6= 1) one nds that the

innite set of intertwiners in (52) is restricted to u(n+,n) with n = n+  h [47].

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

33

this peculiar manifestation of the (0, h = 1) little group e(2) is the cause for the
appearance of the local gauge issue in local quantum physics. unfortunately this
quantum origin is somewhat hidden in the quantization approach, where it remains
invisible behind the geometrical interpretation in terms of bre bundles. in terms of
the potential in the physical fock space we have

u()a(x)u() = 1

 a(x) + h

(83)

where h is a concrete operator involving the a#
 and e from (80). formally the string-
like localized vectorpotential (with localization chosen in the spacelike n-direction)
may be written as a line integral over the eld strength

a(x)   a(x) = f(x)
nf y n  a = 0
a =

1
n  

(84)

where the regularization needed in order to make mathematical sense out of these
stringlike objects and related technical problems will not be discussed in this quali-
tative presentation.

comparing with the massive case, one notes that the problematic aspects of the
use of vectorpotentials in the local description of s=1 show up already in the quan-
tum aspects of free wigner photons before the renormalization procedure. what is
in common to both cases is the fact that no existing formulation of renormalized
perturbation theory is capable to treat dima = 1 nonlocal vectorpotentials in the
framework of wick-polynomials w, both cases can be dealt with in terms of the same
remedy namely cohomological extension by ghosts within a brs-like formalism. as a
result of the availability of arguments based on scattering theory the brs formalism
can be simplied in the massive case whereas in the massless theory one must use
the full brs-formalism which suers contribution from interactions.

in order to get rid of the ghost-catalyzers in favor of a ghostfree formulation,
one has to go signicantly outside the present perturbative framework. a hint where
to look comes from the observation that the ghosts have been introduced to lower
the operator dimension of a from two to one, while still maintaining the (formal)
locality and the covariance of the operators. this is clearly an o-shell short distance
argument. so this observation suggests to look for an on-shell formulation. on-shell
quantities are the true s-matrix and formfactors of physical operators a between
multiparticle scattering states:

s

|p1, ...pniout = |p1, ...pniin
out hp1...pm| a|p1, ...pniin

(85)

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

34

note that we dened the formfactors in such a way that the matrix elements of
s are equal to the formfactor of the identity operator. so the rst question is: can
one compute the perturbative expansion of s while staying on-shell all the time. the
causal approach used before does not fulll this requirement, since the bogoliubov
transition operator s(g) is o shell (in the sense of this paper) and only approaches
the mass shell in the asymptotic limit33.
in fact it is not possible to formulate
causality which involves products of elds directly on-shell, its indirect formulation
goes through the notoriously elusive crossing symmetry together with some inexorably
linked subtle analytic continuation properties. so the question can be reformulated
as: does unitarity, crossing symmetry and a lowest order (tree-structure) input for s
allow an on-shell iterative approach ala epstein and glaser?

by an on-shell construction of s we mean its direct construction without the
(analytically simpler but conceptually more complicated way) detour through s(g)
with g o-shell. up to one loop order such construction already exists in the literature
and was recently used for calculations in thermal qft [7]. by contour deformation of
the standard one loop integral one obtains a manifestly crossing-symmetric sum over
(forward and backward) mass shell integrations. in this way the one-loop integration
will be reduced to mass shell integrations (one of the loop particles is on its mass
shell) over tree diagrams which have been closed at two ends. such representations
were used in particular in d=1+1 [5]34, and the techniques probably date back to the
60ies [26]. note that the basic input are the tree diagrams and not, as in the causal
approach, the interaction vertices (which for the trilinear case generically vanish on-
shell). therefore the one-loop approximation of s for vectormesons will not need
ghosts whereas the o-shell s(g) does. unfortunately the authors only express their
belief in a generalization to multi-loops [48] but indicated no proof. we hope to
return to this important point in the near future.

believing for a moment that the answer is positive, the next question is: can we
compute the perturbation expansion of formfactors for a known perturbative expan-
sion of s ? at this point this program would merge and become a special application
of a much broader construction of a kind of perturbation theory of local algebras

33the dierence between on- and o-shell looks quite innocuous in momentum space, however
the spacetime aspects could be dierent.
in order to illustrate this point, just look at the mas-
sive thirring model. the s(g) resp. the eld correlation functions show the full eld theoretic
vacuum- and one-particle polarization structure (virtual particle structure) whereas the s-matrix
and the closely related pfg wedge generators are quantum mechanical i.e. obey particle number
conservation.

34the main motivation of that paper was to point out that in d=1+1 all one-loop integrals can
be described in terms of one universal master function times the tree expression.
in this way
the factorization property of the tree approximation in theories without real particle creation was
shown to remain stable in passing to the one-loop terms. there is no such master representation for
d  2 + 1.

which avoids the use of individual elds. such an approach has been recently formu-
lated by one of the present authors (b. s.) [37][34] but up to date it only has been
applied to the special case of d=1+1 factorizing models. its main new ingredients
are modular theory and the existence of polarization free one-particle generators
of wedge algebras (pfgs). these pfgs are operators which are wedge-localized
and whose one time application to the vacuum vector creates a clean one particle
state, without those particle/antiparticle polarization clouds which are inexorably
associated with smaller than wedge localizations at least in the presence of interac-
tions. these pfgs are so to say the best compromise between particles and elds
because the (von neumann) algebras generated by them contain on the one hand
no annihilators of the vacuum (which is a typical property of elds restricted to re-
gions which permit a nontrivial spacelike complement), and on the other hand they
have the mentioned pfg property (related to the fact that a wedge is transformed
into itself by an appropriate lorentz-boost). their correlation functions are uniquely
xed in terms of products of nonoverlapping s-matrices and their thermal kms-
property which expresses their modular wedge localization [38] is equivalent to the
crossing symmetry of the s-matrix. their mixed correlation functions with one ad-
ditional operator a  a(w ) are closely related to the above generalized formfactors.
for the mentioned case of a d=1+1 factorizing s-matrix, the fouriertransforms of
the pfgs turned out to coalesce with the zamolodchikov-faddeev operators, whch
shows that pfgs are too noncommutative in order to be visible in a quantization or
euclidean approach. in this case one can go beyond perturbation theory and obtain
the conceptual basis [37][34] as well as a computational formalism for the karowski-
weisz-smirnov [28][41]bootstrap-formfactor programm.

it should be clear that such a perturbative modular construction program for non-
factorizing higher dimensional theories, if feasible, would not need any ghosts. this
is so since their only role was to allow the incorporation of vectormesons into the
standard renormalization approach based on the o-shell time-ordered (or retarded)
vacuum expectations, i.e.
they are short-distance behavior-improving objects (by
lowering the operator dimension of the interaction density). a perturbative approach
based on modular localization and pfgs however does not use such concepts at all. in
fact the wedge localized pfgs and their correlation functions have a kind of natural
cuto as a result of their extremely large localization and their only role is to create
the wedge algebras. in this context the formfactors are not associated with individual
operators in this algebra, but rather one is dealing with spaces of formfactors formed
by all elements in that algebra sandwiched between in and out vectors. instead of
the short distance behavior of special (lagrangian) eld coordinates, the existence
problem of models now depends on the nontriviality of double cone algebras obtained
via intersecting wedge algebras [37][34] [38]. even if there would be already suciently
many concrete results in this new approach, it would be advisable to put this into

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

36

a separate paper because the very concepts and methods will be very dierent from
those used in this paper.

6. future perspectives

the history of gauge theory and its connection with higher spin renormalizable qft
is one of the most revealing and fascinating in the development of concepts in qft.
contrary to a widespread opinion, we believe that this is still an unnished story
with possible future surprises in store.

the usefulness of the role of the gauge principle as a selection principle in the
classical setting is beyond any controversy. this is even strengthened if we move
to the realm of the semiclassical setting for quantum matter coupled to external
elds (minimal electromagnetic-coupling), in fact it is only this setting which has
the most direct relation to the dierential geometric concepts of bre bundles. the
full qft involving perturbatively interacting massive vectormesons however does not
need such a principle if one demands (as one does for any other theory) renormal-
izability. to the contrary, the spin one situation has a very rigid connection of the
assumed observable particle content with the admissable interaction, as we saw in
section 4. in some way this explains the (quasi)classical gauge principle in the bohr
correspondence limit. we also argued that the occurrence of additional physical de-
grees of freedom in interactions is a consequence of the required renormalizability
of spin=1 situations. the simplest and (under reasonable assumptions) perhaps the
only perturbative consistent possibility is a scalar particle: the ubiquitous higgs, but
now stripped of its vacuum expectation hallmark and delegated to its consisteny role
in the perturbative version of the schwinger-swieca screening. again we expect that
this important consistency feature will come out much more clearly in a ghostfree
approach.

it is interesting to look back and ask if and where this alternative viewpoint
on massive vectormesons has occurred before. naturally in all approaches leaning
heavily on quantization and dierential geometry, one does not nd it. this includes
the famous yang-mills paper and presumably also its older predecessor, a 1938/39
conference report by oscar klein (which, as a consequence of the second world war,
did not lead to a theoretical discussion on vectormesons).
in fact the mentioned
particle physics criticism by pauli, concerning the limitation to zero mass and the
ensuing infrared problems, was well taken and it was only through the incorporation
of the higgs mechanism into standard model that weinberg and salam were able
to make that theory work and to overcome paulis criticism. within a gauge-based
approach this was also the only way to accomplish this.

however already before the contribution of higgs there were attempts to counter-
act paulis gauge dictum against massive vectormesons by slightly dierent ideas. as
already mentioned, one was schwingers screening mechanism.

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

37

the point of view which we have been favoring (at the end of section 4) is inverse
to schwingers. instead of screening the zero mass situation via the schwinger-higgs
mechanism, we would like to start from the conceptually simpler massive theory and
talk about liberation of charges. the advantage would be that the necessary decou-
pling of the physical (the higgs analogue) degree of freedom, which was required by
perturbative renormalization in that limit, will be inexorably linked with the emer-
gence of the infraparticle aspects (including their semiinnite stringlike localization)
of the liberated charge carriers.

question about the possible nonintrinsic nature of the higgs mechanism are ac-
tually quite old but remained dormant for a long time, probably as a result of the
unexpected enduring success of the standard model. but sometimes people did worry
about it. for example p. w. anderson [1] investigated an interesting physical anal-
ogy to the plasmon problem and made the following comment about the mechanism
behind massive photons: how, then, if we were conned to a plasma as we are to the
vacuum and could only measure renormalized quantities, might we try to determine
whether, before turning on the eects of electromagnetic interaction, a (the vector-
potential) had been a massless gauge eld and...
. as far as we can see this is not
possible. but even the well-known elitzurs theorem can be interpreted as pointing
into this direction.

it is perhaps not even the signicant phenomenological success of the standard
model which chained most physicist to the interpretation of the vectormeson mass in
terms of the higgs mechanism within gauge theory , but rather the desire to subjugate
all physics to the (classical) elegance of dierential geometry than to open up some
new and dicult conceptual problems about real time local quantum physics.

our viewpoint suggests that it may be physically very fruitful to look for a ghost-
free formulation in form of a on-shell perturbation theory of the s-matrix and the
closely related wedge algebra by using some features of tomitas modular theory as
adapted to the wedge situation. this would be the safest and most systematic way to
decide whether there exist other higher spin s>1 theories which lead to renormalizable
physical theories (outside the standard power counting for the operator dimension of
the interaction polynomial w ) without knowing any cohomological trick. it may be
also the safest way to understand whether perturbative consistency arguments re-
quiring the presence of more physical degree of freedoms (the true story behind the
higgs particle) are part of a bigger story.

if we succeed to direct some of the attention, which has been given during the
last 25 years to geometric/mathematical aspects back towards the the many open
and interesting conceptual local quantum problems, the time it took for writing this
paper was well spent.

7. appendix a: the s-matrix to first order
first we prove the following statement (which is of general interest):

lemma 2: let v (x) be an arbitrary wick polynomial with derivatives (i.e. an
arbitrary element of the borchers class of the free elds which are present) and let
all free elds be massive. then the relation

lim

0z d4x v (x)g(x) = 0,

(g  d(r4),

g(0) = 1)

(86)

implies that there exists another wick polynomial (with derivatives) w 

1 such that

v = w 

1 + v0.

(87)

thereby v0 is the sum of all wick monomials c : a1 aj1(x)...an ajn(x) : (c =const.,
aj is a free eld with mass mj) in v for which the masses mj1, ..., mjn are such that
the solution for (k1, ..., kn)  r4n of

k1 + ... + kn = 0 ^ k2

l = m2

jl l = 1, ..., n

(88)

contains no non-empty open subset of the manifold k2

l = m2

jl l = 1, ..., n.

a simple example for a term in v0 is : (x)3 :, where ((cid:3) + m2) = 0, m > 0.
proof:35 to simplify the notations we assume that the free elds are bosonic
scalars, the generalization to other types of free elds is obvious. global factors 2
are omitted in the whole proof. we write v in the form

v (x) =xn xj1,...,jn

pj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) : aj1(x1)...ajn(xn) : |x1=...=xn=x,

(89)

where the sum over n is nite, the ajs are free elds and pj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) is a
polynomial in the partial derivatives xl
 , 1  l  n. obviously we may replace
pj1...jn(x1 , ..., xn) by

pj1...jn(x1 , ..., xn) =

1

n! xsn

pj(1)...j(n)(x(1), ..., x(n))

(90)

in (89). in terms of annihilation and creation operators the free elds read

al(y) =z d4p (p2  m2

l ) al(p)eipy,

al(p) := [(p0)al(~p) + (p0)b+

l (~p)]

proof of lemma 2 (including appendix b)) in [9].

more precisely k0
l < 0 for l = s + 1, ..., t. if r1, ..., rt are such
that the corresponding term belongs to (v  v0), then the condition (93) restricts the
polynomial pr1...rt in the following way. we make a taylor expansion with respect to
k = (k1 + ... + kt) at k = 0:
pr1...rt(ik1, ..., ikt) = pr1...rt(ik1, ..., ikt1,i(k1 + ...kt1)) + ik q
where q
appear in (v  v0)) that pr1...rt(ik1, ..., ikt1,i(k1 + ... + kt1)) vanishes if k0

(the sign of k0
l obeys the above prescription). buchholz and fredenhagen proved in ap-
pendix b) of [9] 37 that this implies that there exist other polynomials p (l)(k1, ..., kt1)
(l = 1, ..., t) (for simplicity we omit the indices r1, ..., rt) such that

r1...rt is also a polynomial. from (93) we conclude (for all (r1, ..., rt) which
l =

36usually there are several possibilities to contract the creation and annihilation operators. all

give the same contribution due to the permutation symmetry of pr1...rt (90).

37this proof is non-elementary, it relies on results of the theory of polynomial rings. the proof
is given for vanishing masses. it is quite obvious that the statement holds also in the massive case,
but we have not worked out a proof.

(we set q

r1...rt := 0 if (r1, ..., rt) belongs to v0) which is the assertion (87). (cid:3)

physical consistency (31) to rst order means

lim

0z d4x g(x)[q, w (x)]|ker q = 0.

(97)

by an obvious modication of the above lemma we conclude from this condition that
there exists a wick polynomial w 

1 such that

[q, w (x)]|ker q = (iw 

1 (x) + [q, w(0)(x)])|ker q,

(98)

where w(0) is that part of w which satises the kinematical equations (88) for a
discrete set of momenta only, similarly to v0 in the lemma. (for a free eld  note
that [q, (x)] satises the same eld equation as  and hence has the same mass.)
since ([q, w (x)]  iw 
1 (x)  [q, w(0)(x)]) is a local operator, we can apply the
reeh-schlieder theorem and obtain that the latter expression vanishes everywhere
(cf. (69)), i.e. we may omit the restriction to ker q on both sides in (98). in addition
w must satisfy the requirements (a)-(e) listed in section 2.

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

41

quadrilinear terms in w (x) (i.e. terms : aaaa :, : aauu :, : uuuu :, :
 :, : aa :, : uu :, : h 2 :, : aah 2 :, : uuh 2 :, : h 4 :) belong
to (w  w(0)), hence they must satisfy the q-divergence condition to rst order
(29). the only solution is : h 4 : [22], but such a term will be excluded by physical
consistency (31) to second order.
a trilinear term in w (x) (with masses m1, m2 and m3) does not belong to w(0)

i there exists a permutation   s3 such that

m(3) > m(1) + m(2).

(99)

but physical consistency to higher orders will require m1 = m2 = m3 =: m apart
from the h-couplings (mh > 0 will not be restricted; see sect. 2). neglecting this
exception we conclude

s(3)
1 = lim

0z d4x g(x)w (3)(x) = 0

(100)

and [q, s(3)
1 ] = 0 (31) is trivially satised. (the upper index (3) refers to the trilinear
terms.) to get restrictions on w (3) we must consider physical consistency (31) to
orders n  2, especially for second order tree diagrams.
8. appendix b: determination of the parameters in w and fint by

requiring [q,fint(x; w )] = 0

the calculation is lengthy, hence we concentrate on the essential points. we de-
termind the parameters in the ansatz for w (41) and fint (67) by inserting these
expressions into the physicality requirement (69) to lowest perturbative orders. once
a parameter is xed, its value will be used in the following calculations without men-
tioning it.

- to zeroth order the condition is trivially fullled due to38

- to rst order the equation

[q, f 

d ] = 0.

[q,f (1)

d (x)] + iz dx1 [q, r(w (x1); fd(x))] = 0

(101)

(102)

38if we would not have made the assumption c(0)
k = 0 (i), we would nd here that most of the
zeroth order coecients must vanish. it would remain f  (0)
a h 2 :
only. x(0) and z(0) are then forced to vanish by higher orders of (69). but this complicates the
calculation a lot and the assumption c(0)

k = 0 is reasonable. so we do not do this eort here.

be written in the form

where c is an arbitrary constant. the terms  (x0 x0
x1), ret(x  x1), ret(x  x1), where ret is the retarded fundamental solution
of the klein gordon equation, supp ret  v +. the term  c(x  x1) is due to
the non-uniqueness of the extension of t (w (x1); f 
d (x)) to the diagonal x1 = x2.
this is similar to the tree normalization terms (49). the tensor fbcd which is the
same as in the ansatz for w 39 is antisymmetrized according to the normalization
condition f 
d int (iv). now let 1, 2 be arbitrary free elds and y1, y2 
r4, (yj  x)2 < 0 (j = 1, 2). by commuting (102) with 1(y1) and 2(y2) we obtain

d int = f 
0 =z dx1 [[[q, [fd(x), w (x1)]], 1(y1)], 2(y2)](x0  x0

(104)

1).

we conclude that for x1  (x + v ) \ {x} the expression [q, [fd(x), w (x1)]] must be
a divergence of a local operator with respect to x1,40 i.e. there must exist a two-point
distribution r

1d(x1, x) with

(x0  x0

1)[q, [fd(x), w (x1)]] = x1

 r

1d(x1, x) + (x  x1)pd(x),

(105)

where pd(x) is a wick polynomial (with constant coecients) in free elds (possibly
with derivative). in contrast to the adiabatic limit of w (86) there is no kinematical
restriction (in the sense of (88)) here, because one of the free eld operators in w (x1)
is contracted with f (x) and, hence, the corresponding momentum must not be on-
shell. we have not worked out a general proof (in the style of appendix a) of the
step from (104) to (105). but the explicit calculations show that this conclusion is
correct.41 inserting (105) and (103) into (102) it results

[q,f  (1)

d

d (x)  c

(fbcd  fcbd)[q, : a

(106)

39we use here an additional normalization condition, namely that the term  c(x  x1) :
the term in (x0 
aa : has the same colour tensor as the corresponding non-local term (i.e.
x0
1)[f (x), w (x1)] with the same external legs).
40note that every operator valued distribution g(x1, ..., xn), (xj  r4) can be written as diver-
 r dy d...(x1  y)g(y, x2, ..., xn), where d...

gence of a non-local operator, e.g. g(x1, ..., xn) = x1
is a fundamental solution of the wave equation.

41this remark concerns also the analogous (more complicated) steps from (110) to (113) and from

(129) to (130) in second and third order.

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

43

which means that the local terms42 must satisfy the condition (102) separately.
later when we shall know more about w (which determines pd by (105)), we will
compute most of the coecients in f (1)
(67) and the normalization constant c from
(106). inserting (101) into (105) we nd that w must fulll

nomial) (29). but the higher orders of the physicality requirement (69) yield more
information about w .

where we have inserted (60), (61) and the causal factorization (4) of the time-ordered
products due to x 6 {x1, x2} + v . similarly to the step from (104) to (105) we
conclude that [q, r(w (x1)w (x2); fd(x))|tree] must be a sum of divergences (with

where divy means some divergence of a local operator with respect to y. next we
specialize to the subregion x0
2, where t (w (x1)w (x2)) factorizes. by means of
again (107) we see that w must satisfy
[[fd(x), w (x1)], [q, w (x2)]]|tree = divx1 + divx2 for x1, x2  (x + v ) \ {x}, x0

1 > x0

1 > x0
2.
(114)

inserting the ansatz for w into this condition one nds that (114) yields the same
restrictions on the parameters in w as the q-divergence condition to rst order (29):

[q, w ] = divergence of a wick polynomial.

(115)

in other words we obtain the same results for the parameters in w as in (45), espe-
cially fabc = abc. we recall that these values of the parameters are not only necessary
for (115), they are also sucient. hence (107) is also fullled. by inserting (115) into
(113) we nd the condition

[fd(x), [q, t (w (x1)w (x2))|tree]] = divx1 + (x1  x2)

for x1, x2  (x + v ) \ {x}.
(116)

this is a necessary but not sucient condition for [q, t (w (x1)w (x2))|tree] = divx1 +
(x1  x2). to get the full information of this latter condition we need to go to third
order.
- however, rst we return to the local terms to rst order (106), because we
shall need the validity of this equation. we explicitly calculate the terms on the l.h.s.
of (105), transform them into divergence form (as far as possible) and obtain44

p 
d = bcd[f 

b uc  a

b  uc + a

b uc].

(117)

44by the experience of [2] we know that all contributions to pd come from the contraction of fd(x)

with a(x1) in the rst term of w (x1) (41).

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

inserting this into (106) we nd that (106) is fullled i the normalization

is chosen and the rst order coecients in f 

d int take the values

(119)

x(1) and z(1) are still arbitrary. note that (107), (118) and (119) are not only necessary
for (102), together they are also sucient.

- we now consider the condition (69) to third order, i.e. the analogous equation
to (102), (108). by commuting this equation with arbitrary free elds 1(y1), 2(y2),
3(y3), 4(y4), (yl  x)2 < 0 l, we obtain

0 =

only tree diagrams of the following types contribute (we use the same notations as
in (109)): in the rst term

8 (x2  x3) : b9(x1)b10(x2)b11(x3)b12(x3) : +...

(123)

where the dots mean terms obtained by cyclic permutations.
in the rst term in
(120) we take (60) and the causal factorization basing on x 6 ({x2, x3} + v ) into
account. by means of (115) it results

i2

2!z dx2dx3 [[[[{[[q,f (1)(x)], t (w (x2)w (x3))]  w (x2)[[q,f (1)(x)], w (x3)]

w (x3)[[q,f (1)(x)], w (x2)]}|tree, 1(y1)]..., 4(y4)]. (124)

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

46

additionally we have used that due to (121) only the disconnected diagram of t (w (x2)
w (x3)) contributes, hence [...[f (1)(x), [q, t (w (x2)w (x3))]]..., 4(y4)] = divx2 +divx3
by (115).
in the second term in (120) the situation is more complicated. the diagrams of
the type (123) obey the causal factorization basing on x 6 ({x1, x2, x3} + v ). but
for the diagrams of the type (122) we only know x 6 ({x2, x3} + v ) (or promul-
gated congurations). to x the position of the third vertex we consider two smooth
functions h1, h2 with

1 = h1(y) + h2(y) y  x + v ,

x  supp h1,
(yl  z)2 < 0 z  supp h1, l = 1, 2, 3, 4.

h1  d(r4),

supp h2  x + v + = ,

(125)

with that the second term in (120) can be written in the form

i3

3!z dx1dx2dx3 (h1(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3) + h2(x1)h1(x2)h2(x3) + h2(x1)h2(x2)h1(x3)
+h2(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3))[...[q, r(w (x1)...; f (x))|tree]..., 4(y4)].

(126)

in the terms with a factor h1(xl) the diagrams of the type (122) contribute only, and
we may insert the causal factorization due to {x, xl}  ({xj, xk} + v ) =  (where
{l, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}). so the contribution of (h1(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3)+h2(x1)h1(x2)h2(x3)+
h2(x1)h2(x2)h1(x3)) in (126) reads
2!z dx1dx2dx3 h1(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3)[...{[[q, r(w (x1); f (x))], t (w (x2)w (x3))]
w (x2)[[q, r(w (x1); f (x))], w (x3)]

(127)

i3

where we have used [q, t (w (x2)w (x3))] = divx2 + divx3, which holds true here for
the same reason as in (124). >from (102) and (103) we know

[q,f (1)(x)] + iz dx1 h1(x1)[q, r(w (x1); f (x))]

= iz dx1 h2(x1)[q, r(w (x1); f (x))] = iz dx1 h2(x1)x1

 [f (x), w 

1 (x1)],(128)

where we have used [q, w ] =  w 
(120). by means of (128) we obtain

1 (115). we now insert (127), (126) and (124) into

0 =

where x2(...) and x3(...) are obtained from x1(...) by cyclic permutation. the next
step is analogous to the step from (104) to (105), but more complicated because one
has to care about the cancellation of the boundary terms. taking the freedom in
the choice of h2 into account, (129) is equivalent to the existence of a local operator
r
3(x1; x2, x3; x) with
[q, r(w (x1)w (x2)w (x3); f (x))]|tree = x1

3(x1; x2, x3; x) + cyclic permutations,
(130)

 r

x1, x2, x3  (x + v ) \ {x},

because the contribution from e.g. x1(...) in (129) is equal to

i3



3!z dx1dx2dx3 ( h2)(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3)[...r

3(x1; x2, x3; x)..., 4(y4)].

(131)

let us explain this latter statement. first note that due to (62) and (125) there is
only a contribution in (131) for x1, x2, x3  (x + v ) \ {x}  x1 6 ({x2, x3} + v ).
in this region we have

r(w (x1)w (x2)w (x3); f (x)) = [[f (x), w (x1)], t (w (x2)w (x3))]
w (x2)[[f (x), w (x1)], w (x3)]
w (x3)[[f (x), w (x1)], w (x2)]

(132)

due to causal factorization. now we take into account that (in this region) x1
3(x1;
x2, x3; x) comes from the [q, w (x1)]-terms in [q, r(w w w ; f )] (where r(w w w ; f )
is given by (132)). however, by replacing w (x1) by  w 
1 (x1) in (132) we obtain
exactly the x1(...)-term in (129).

 r

by means of causal factorization and (101), (115), (116) the condition (130) can

be written in the form

{[f (x), [q, t (w (x1)w (x2)w (x3))]] + [q, t (w (x2)w (x3))][w (x1), f (x)]
+[q, t (w (x1)w (x2))][w (x3), f (x)] + [q, t (w (x1)w (x3))][w (x2), f (x)]}|tree
(133)
for x1, x2, x3  (x+ v )\{x}. next we specialize to the subregion x1 6 ({x2, x3}+ v ).
again by causal factorization and (116) we nd that t (w (x2)w (x3)) must fulll

= divx1 + cyclic permutations

[[f (x), w (x1)], [q, t (w (x2)w (x3))]]|tree = divx1 + divx2 + divx3

(134)
for x1, x2, x3  (x+ v )\{x}  x1 6 ({x2, x3}+ v ). inserting the explicit expression
for w (with the values of the parameters obtained so far) one sees that this condition
is equivalent to

[q, t (w (x2)w (x3))|tree] = divx2 + (x2  x3).

(135)

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

48

as we mentioned in section 2 the latter requirement is satised i the masses agree
m  m1 = m2 = m3 (47), the parameters of the h-coupling take the values (48)45
and if the normalization constants in the tree normalization terms (49) are suitably
chosen (up to  (50) they are uniquely xed by (135)). so far there remain two free
parameters in w and t (w w )|tree: s (41) (cf. (48)) and  (50). in section 2 they
have been determined by

[q, t (w (x1)w (x2)w (x3))|tree] = divx1 + cyclic permutations.

(136)

by inserting (135) into (133) we nd the weaker requirement

[f (x), [q, t (w (x1)w (x2)w (x3))|tree]] = divx1 + cyclic permutations

(137)
for x1, x2, x3  (x + v ) \ {x}. but the latter condition does not determined s and
. one needs to consider the physicality condition (69) to fourth order. there the
values (51) for s and  are obtained, as can be seen by an analogous procedure. so we
obtain exactly the same results for the parameters in w and the tree normalizations
in t (w w ) as in section 2. we recall that they agree completely with the interaction
lagrangian obtained by the higgs mechanism.

- now we have explained how to handle the essential diculties which appear in
the determination of the parameters in w (41) and in fint (67) by the physicality
(69). we do not give further details. instead we give a heuristic summary and the
remaining results. to n-th order the requirement (69) reads

0 = [q,f (n)

d (x)] +

n

xl=1

il

l!z dx1...dxl [q, r(w (x1)...w (xl);f (nl)

d

(x))]

(138)

d  fd.

where f (0)
(i) in the non-local terms (xj 6= x for at least one j) we can apply the causal
factorization (4) of the time-ordered products. then the non-local terms in (138)
cancel due to

[q, t (w (x1)...w (xk))] = sum of divergences of local operators,

1  k  n,

(139)

and the physicality (138) to lower orders < n (see e.g. (128-129)). we have seen that
for the tree diagrams to lowest orders the condition (139) is not only sucient for the
cancellation, it is also necessary. but the lowest orders tree diagrams of (139) x the
parameters in w and t (w w )|tree, as was shown in [2].
for the cancellation of the non-local terms in (138) it is not important which
kind of physical elds we require to exist, the properties (i)-(vi) of fint (67) are
45in the following calculations the undetermined sign  in (48) is chosen to be  = 1.

massive vectormesons and gauge theory

essentially not needed. hence we conjecture that already the existence of any non-
trivial observable xes the interaction.

(ii) the cancellation of the remaining terms in (138), which are local (i.e. their
support is the total diagonal xj = x, j), requires a suitable normalization of the
time-ordered products t (w (x1)...w (xl);f (nl)
(x)) (see e.g. (118)) and a suitable
choice of the parameters in f (nl)
in this way the latter
parameters are uniquely determined (at least to lowest orders).

(140)

the very last equation results from the terms  g2 : f (x)u(x)h 2(x) :. in this case
the cancellation is of a special kind as explained below. the other equations are
obtained analogously to (106), (119). they come from bilinear and trilinear terms.
x(1), x(2) and z(2) are still arbitrary.

to third order the terms  g3 : f (x)u(x)(x)(x) :, ( g3 : f (x)u(x)h 2(x) :

summing up (119), (140) and (141) we obtain the result (70). but we have not
checked that the cancellation of the local terms in (138) can be achieved for loop
diagrams and for tree diagrams to higher orders. for the tree diagrams with more
than three external legs (e.g. the very last equation in (140) and the terms considered
in (141)) there is no contribution from f (n)
in (138) due to our ansatz (67). hence
the parameters in f (nl)
, l  1 are available only (besides normalization constants).
however, most of the latter parameters have already been xed (or restricted) by (138)
to lower orders. (for example to achieve the cancellation of the terms considered in
(141), it is important that x(1) (z(2) resp.) has not been xed previously.) so we
have shown the existence of observables f 
d int, d = 1, 2, 3, only partially. but there
is a strong hint that this holds true for all terms to all orders from the identication
(given in the main text) of our physical elds f 
d int (70) as gauge invariant elds in
the framework of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the su(2) gauge symmetry.
46mainly parameters in f (n)

are determined; most of the parameters in f (nl)

have already been xed in earlier steps of the induction.
