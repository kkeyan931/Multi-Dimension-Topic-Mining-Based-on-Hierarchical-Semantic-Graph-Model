abstract

we consider the ordinary and noncommutative dirac-born-infeld theories within the open string
-model. first, we propose a renormalization scheme, hybrid point splitting regularization, that leads
directly to the seiberg-witten description including the two-form . we also show how such a form
appears within the standard renormalization scheme just by some freedom in changing variables.
second, we propose a wilson factor which has the noncommutative gauge invariance on the classical
level and then compute the -model partition function within one of the known renormalization
scheme that preserves the noncommutative gauge invariance. as a result, we nd the noncommutative
yang-mills action.

introduction

the open string -model was a hot topic in the eighties as it provided a basic tool to derive the low
energy eective action (dirac-born-infeld action) that is nonperturbative in  [1, 2, 3] 1. later it was
also realized that it is useful for d-brane physics [5]. recently, it has been pointed out by seiberg
and witten that a special renormalization scheme, a point splitting regularization, results in a rather
peculiar situation where the space-time (brane) coordinates do not commute (see [6] and refs. therein).
the purpose of this paper is to further develop ideas about the appearance of noncommutative geometry
by the open string -models.

our conventions and some features of the quantization of open strings ending on d-branes that are

relevant to our discussion are the following:

1. the -model action is given by

s =

bji x ix j + ai(x) x i(cid:17) +  ,

(1.1)

where d means the string world-sheet (disk or half plane) whose boundary is d. gij, bij,  are the
constant metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton elds, respectively. we also included in (1.1) the
abelian background gauge eld ai(x). x i map the world-sheet to the brane and i, j = 1, . . . , p + 1.
the world-sheet indices are denoted by a, b.

at this point, let us make a couple of remarks. first, we keep the explicit dependence on the
constant dilaton eld because it plays an important role in what follows. second, for a constant b eld
bijabax ibx j is a total derivative, so we write this term as a boundary interaction.

2. a natural object to compute within the path integral is the -model partition function

z[, g, b, a, ] =z dx es

,

(1.2)

that results in the open string low energy eective action (born-infeld action) as well as the d-brane
action (dirac-born-infeld action) (for a review and refs., see, [4, 5]).

to compute the partition function (1.2) one rst integrates over the internal points of the disc to
reduce the integral to the boundary and next splits the integration variable x i in the constant and
the non-constant part as x i( ) = xi + i( ). as a result, one gets the innite set of the vertices
f, f, 2f etc 2. next the perturbation theory in  is used to compute the leading terms of z. the
derivative-independent part of the partition function proves to be the dirac-born-infeld action namely,

z[, g, b, a, ] = sdbi + o(f ) = ez [dx]pdet(g + 2(f + b)) + o(f )

,

(1.3)

where fij = iaj  jai and [dx] = dp+1x

(2)p+1 . the above result is based on the use of one of the
standard renormalization schemes like pauli-villars or -function which was originally used by fradkin
and tseytlin [1].

it is natural to ask, whether dierent renormalization schemes used to compute the path integral lead
to the same answer. it was understood in the eighties that the ambiguity in the structure of z related
to the choice of a renormalization scheme should be a particular case of the eld redenition ambiguity
present in the eective action reconstructed from the s-matrix. in other words, only structures in z
that are invariant under the eld redenition are relevant.

3. seiberg and witten pointed out that in the framework of the point splitting regularization
scheme the leading terms of the perturbation theory are summed into the noncommutative version of
the dirac-born-infeld action namely,

z[ , g, , a, ] = sdbi +  = e z [dx]qdet(g + 2 f ) + . . .
where fij = i aj  j ai  i ai  aj + i aj  ai. here the -product is dened by

,

(1.4)

zj f (x + y)g(x + z)|y=z=0
it is well-known that such a product is noncommutative but associative.

f (x)  g(x) = e

i

2 ij 
yi



.

(1.5)

as we mentioned above, the dierent renormalization schemes are equivalent, so using a change of

variables one has to get

sdbi = sdbi + total derivative terms + o(f )

.

in the case of interest the change of variables found by seiberg and witten is given by [6]

g = (g  2b)g1(g + 2b)
 =  +

ln det(cid:16)g(g + 2b)1(cid:17) ,

1
2

,

 = (2)2(g + 2b)1b(g  2b)1
f = f + f f  (a)f + o(2)

.

,

2for the sake of simplicity, we use the matrix notations here and below.

(1.6)

(1.7)

note that the last relation is simplied in the case of a constant eld f . explicitly,

f = (1 + f )1f .

(1.8)

moreover, it was also conjectured in [6] that the use of a suitable regularization that interpolates

between the both mentioned above results in

z[, g, , a, ] = sdbi +  = ez [dx]pdet(g + 2(f + )) + . . .

where  is some two-form. in this case the relations (1.7) are modied to

,

seiberg-witten conjecture via -model

the aim of this section is to show how the seiberg-witten conjecture (1.9) may be simply derived
within the -model approach. first, we start from the point splitting renormalization scheme. then we
propose how to modify it to get the desired result. second, we start with the -function renormalization
scheme and use the change of variables (-model couplings) to get (1.9). in the both cases  naturally
appears due to freedom in choosing new variables.

2.1 hybrid point splitting regularization

following the ideas sketched in the introduction, we split the integration variable x i and moreover
include the b  term into the kinetic term that is usual for the problem at hand [2, 6]. so we have for
the partition function (1.2)

z[, g, b, a, ] = ez [dx] h esint i

,

h . . . i =z d es0 . . .

d a(x + ) 

,

,

(2.1)

s0 =

1

2zd

d d  t n 1

, sint = izd

where n = g1 ln(   )2 + i

2 (   ). the matrices g,  are given by eq. (1.7).

expanding the interaction part in a and doing the fourier transform, the partition function is

z[, g, b, a, ] = ez [dx]



xn=0

n!z z dnz z dp+1kn eixa(k1) . . . a(kn) h

n

yj=1

eikj (j ) ig,  ,
(2.2)

where  = k1 +  + kn.
from now let us stick to the point splitting regularization. we are aware of the problem to dene
what is meant by the point splitted path integral for the partition function. instead of giving a general
answer, we dene for our purpose a hybrid point splitting regularization. as used in [6] the point splitting
regularization is not dened per se, but only in connection with a partial summation of perturbation
theory that includes b  term into the kinetic term. this results in an additive part i
2 (   ) in the
corresponding propagator. everywhere the propagator ends on vertices which contain a  -derivative,
part of the regularization is to drop the  term. we use this rule throughout, also for possible operator
expressions inside functional determinants. but we insist that the determinants for the remaining

3

expressions are treated within the standard renormalization scheme like pauli-villars or -function. as
a consequence we get a generalization of the corresponding formula in [6]

eikj (j ) ig, 0

,

(2.3)

where  =   0. as to j, it is the quotient of functional determinants. we have to care of it because
it is relevant for what follows. it is evident that there exists freedom in choosing the new parameter 0.
it turns out that exactly such freedom is responsible for the two-form . let us go on to see that this
is indeed the case. undoing the fourier transform we arrive at 3

an important point we should stress here is that the above redenition of  automatically leads to

a proper redenition of the kinetic term. this time we have

s0 =

(2.5)

with the new matrices for the metric and antisymmetric eld, given by the corresponding inversion of
the relations (1.7)

g =(cid:16)g1 

1

(2)2 0g0(cid:17)1

,  = 

1

(2)2

g0g .

(2.6)

a simple algebra shows that the such dened , g,  obey the seiberg-witten relation (1.10).

since our regularization prescription allows us to treat the functional determinants along the lines

of [1] we nd for j

1
2

det ng,0!
j =  det ng,

det(g + 2)!
=  det(g + 2b)

2

.

(2.7)

the latter may be absorbed by the corresponding redenition of the dilatonic eld (string coupling
constant). thus we get the last relation in (1.10).

let us now dene the wilson factor as

p  exp(cid:16)iz a(x + ) (cid:17) =



xn=0

in

n!z z dn e

i

2 pi>j ij (nm)

n

yj=1

a(xj + j) (j)|x1=...xn=x

.

(2.8)

it is clear that this factor is equal to the usual path ordering p applied to the exponential in the sense
of the -product.

finally, the partition function becomes

z[, g, , a, ] = ez [dx]z d es0 p  exp(cid:16)izd

d a(x + ) (cid:17) .

(2.9)

3we change our notations due to specializing the renormalization scheme. so, a denotes the gauge variable in this

scheme etc.

4

let us now specialise the gauge eld to

ai(x) =

1
2

fjix j

,

(2.10)

with a constant matrix f . then the related noncommutative eld strength is simply given by f = ff f .

for the gauge eld (2.10) the wilson factor (2.8) turns out to be

p  exp(cid:16) i

2zd

d (x + )tf (cid:17) = exp(cid:16) i

2zd

d (x + )tf (cid:17) .

(2.11)

now we just have the functional integral treated in [1] and nd

z[, g, , a, ] = sdbi = ez [dx]pdet(g + 2(f + ))

.

(2.12)

with this formula we have nished an explicit calculation proving that the partition function for a
constant eld strength within the hybrid point splitting renormalization scheme is given by the dirac-
born-infeld action referring to the noncommutative gauge eld. this has been argued for in [6] by
referring to the analogy of the involved structures compared to the commutative case.

2.2

-function regularization

as we have mentioned in the introduction, the dierent renormalization schemes used to compute the
path integral (1.2) lead to the same result after a proper change of the variables (-model couplings) is
done. in fact, such a change of the couplings is nothing but the resummation of the perturbation theory
in . after this is understood, it immediately comes to mind to realize a resummation by changing the
path integral variables. a possible way to do this is to take a new variable as a function of . let us
now show how it works. specialising to the -function renormalization scheme [1], we dene the path
integral measure in the same way as it was done in [7]. so we have

z[, g, b, a, ] = ez [dx]pdet g h esint i

,

s0 =

d d  tgn 1

h . . . i =z d es0 . . .

d t(b + f )  + o(f )

,

,

(2.13)

1

2zd

, sint = izd

above we have rescaled x i as x i  2x i. n is the boundary value of the neumann function.

now let us change the variable i as i = (g1)i 4. in fact, the measure is dened in such a way

that the eect is only due to the action s. the latter becomes

s0 =

2zd

d d  tgn 1

, sint = izd

(2)2

d t(cid:0)

gg + tg1f g1(cid:1) + o(f ) ,

(2.14)

where g = tg1,  = (2)21bt1.
it is evident that as far as  depends on  we automatically get a resummation of the perturbation
theory because the vertices (-model couplings) are redened 5. it is also clear which role the dilaton
eld  has to play. it is responsible for the cancellation of the poles in  within the perturbation theory
i.e., the -dependence of z always looks like z  () p+1

2 (cid:16)1 + o()(cid:17). note that  is an arbitrary

4in fact, it is nothing but gl(p + 1) transforms whose matrices depend on .
5note that  = g + 2b recovers the seiberg-witten relations (1.7).

5

function in g, b, . moreover b plays a key role as it is responsible for -dependence of  because
g is dimensionless. one can also consider  as a function in g, , . in this case the change of the
variables is given by i = (t1g)i.

in general, it is not clear how to exactly compute the partition function. the best what we can do is
to nd the leading terms within the perturbation expansion as it was done in [1, 8, 9]. for our purposes
the one-loop approximation is also sucient. so the problem is reduced to nding the corresponding
determinant. it is straightforward to write down a solution of the problem [1]

sdbi = ez [dx]pdet g rdet(1 

1

2

g + 21f t1g )

.

(2.15)

in doing transformations with the determinant the important thing one should keep in mind is that
the resummation of the perturbation theory assumes that the partition function depends on  as
z  () p+1
with some matrices a and b. so it is clear that we should get rid of the 1
assumes

2 (cid:16)1 + o()(cid:17). as to the determinant, we postulate that it is given by pdet(a + 2b)

 -term. the latter argument

sdbi = epdet(g + 2b) z [dx] rdet(1 + (1 

above we have used that det(g  1
moreover we bring 1 to a form

2 gg) = det(g + 2b).

g)121f t1g )

.

(2.16)

where  is a new matrix that depends on g, , . this results in

1 = (g1 

1

2

) ,

(2.17)

sdbi = epdet(g + 2b) z [dx] rdet(1 + 2f t(g1 +

1

2

))

.

(2.18)

our postulate for the determinant yields the following -dependence of t(g1 + 1

2 )

t(g1 +

1

2

) =

1
2  + ()

,

(2.19)

where () is regular in the limit   0.
substituting (2.19) into (2.18) we nd

sdbi = ez [dx] pdet(1 + f )pdet(1 + 2(1 + f )1f )

above we have also dened a new dilatonic eld as

.

(2.20)

 =  +

1
2

ln

det 1

det(g + 2b)

.

(2.21)

furthermore due to our postulate for the determinant we can represent 1() as 1() =
 + 2 with some -independent matrices  and . so the eq. (2.20) is rewritten in the following
form

sdbi = ez [dx] pdet(1 + f )pdet( + 2( + (1 + f )1f ) )

.

(2.22)

6

let us now see what the matrices , ,  are. to do so, it is worth to remark that ij = gij is a
trivial transform in a sense that it does not lead to any resummation of the perturbation theory. so
we can consider it as a unity in a space of all transforms. it is reasonable to normalize transforms with
respect of this unity by requiring that  has the following asymptotic behaviour j
i + o() as
  0. on the other hand, it also seems reasonable because j
i is the only -independent tensor with
such an index structure we have. then it immediately follows from (2.19) that  = . this allows to
dene a new eld strength f as f = (1 + f )1f that of course coincides with the seiberg-witten
denition (1.8). however, the point is that we have not used the fact that two theories should be in the
same class of equivalence as gauge theories. as a result, the dirac-born-infeld action is rewritten as

i = j

sdbi = ez [dx] pdet(1 + f )pdet( + 2( + f) )

.

(2.23)

furthermore it is clear from the general covariance of the partition function that  must be treated as
a metric g. as to , it coincides with  from eq.(1.9). of course, (2.17), (2.19), (2.21) are equivalent
to the relations (1.10).

finally, we get

sdbi = ez [dx] pdet(1 + f )pdet(g + 2( + f) )

.

(2.24)

what we actually need is only the last factor of the integrand to get the equivalence (1.6). to x
this problem, one subtle point we should remind is that dierent formulations coincide up to derivative
terms. it also assumes that we can integrate by parts that of course makes no sense for constant eld
strengths. in fact, we have to consider slowly varying eld strengths. as a consequence, the relation
between f and f becomes more involved [6]. in the leading order of  it is given by

f = f  f f  (a)f + o(2) = f0  (a)f + o(2)
it is easy to see that in this order the actions (1.9) and (2.24) coincide namely,

.

(2.25)

z [dx](cid:18)pdet(1 + f )pdet(g + 2( + f0) ) pdet(g + 2( + f0  (a)f ) )(cid:19) = 0 .

unfortunately calculations become more and more involved as far as we consider higher order terms.

to conclude, let us comment on the background independence of the action sdbi. since the action
sdbi is explicitly invariant the expression (2.24) we nd in above is also invariant. next what we drop
is total derivative terms, so the action sdbi is invariant at least in the leading order in  modulo total
derivatives.

3 alternative way

in fact, there are two ways in getting the noncommutative yang-mills theory with the -product struc-
ture within the -model. the rst one a la seiberg-witten is to start from the wilson factor that has
the ordinary gauge invariance on the classical level and then get the noncommutative gauge invariance
on the quantum level just by using a proper renormalization scheme. the second way we propose, based
on our experience with the hybrid renormalization scheme, is to start from the wilson factor that has

7

the noncommutative gauge invariance on the classical level and use a regularization that maintains it
on the quantum level 6. so our aim in this section is to show how to realize this proposal.

let us dene the wilson factor as

w [c] = p  exp(cid:16)izc

d a x(cid:17) =



xn=0

inz z dn h(12) . . . h(n1n)a x(1)    a x(n)

,

(3.1)

where the -product is dened with respect to a translational mode of x. such a factor coincides with the
one dened in (2.8). this is clear just by substituting the expansion of unity 1 = h(12) . . . h(n1n) +
(all perms.) 7 and changing the variables  in such a way to get the ordering 1 > 2 >  > n.
note that the denition is nothing but a slightly modied version of the non-abelian wilson factor. of
course, it is simply to t the non-abelian case into the above denition just by allowing the gauge eld
to be a n  n hermitian matrix and taking a trace. explicitly,

w [c] = t rp  exp(cid:16)izc

d a x(cid:17) .

(3.2)

an important point we should stress here is that the wilson factor as it is dened in (3.1) or (3.2)
is almost invariant 8 under the gauge transformation of the noncommutative yang-mills theory namely,
ai = iiai+iai. the latter is clear from an analogy with the non-abelian yang-mills theory
where the gauge invariant expression is given by a trace of p expr a x. of course, this is easy to see by
directly doing the gauge transforms. fortunately for us, what saves the day is that we are interested in
the partition function. indeed, as we saw splitting the integration variable x i automatically provides
the integral over the zero mode (translational mode) xi. this is exactly what we need because in the
noncommutative case the integral does the same job as the trace in the non-abelian case, i.e. it provides

the cyclic property r dp+1x f (x)  g(x) = r dp+1x g(x)  f (x) that is crucial for the gauge invariance.

thus the partition function is gauge invariant.

to be more precise, the partition function is given by

z[a] =z dx es0 p  exp(cid:16)izc

d ai x i(cid:17) , s0 =

1

4 zd

d2z gijax iax j

.

(3.3)

to see that this partition function indeed leads to the noncommutative yang-mills theory it is
instructive to compute its asymptotic behaviour as   0. the main point is that we have to be
careful to preserve the noncommutative gauge invariance. it turns out that the renormalization scheme
based on the -function or some of its modication does this job [1, 8]. the computations are analogous
to the ordinary non-abelian case [9]. as a result, we nd

z[a] =z [dx]det g(cid:16)1 +

1
4

(2)2fij  fklgikgjl + o( 5

2 )(cid:17) ,

(3.4)

with fij = iaj  jai  iai  aj + iaj  ai.
that appears is t r.

it is straightforward to generalize these computations for the non-abelian case. the only new thing

finally, let us briey show how to incorporate susy within the above formalism. for simplicity, let
us consider the nsr formalism. in other words, we add a set of the fermionic elds i whose metric also

6 some similar motivations are provided by the quantization of open strings in a constant b eld background where

the deformation parameter  is explicitly related with zero modes (see, e.g., [10] and refs. therein).

7h means the heaviside step function.
8it becomes gauge invariant after the integration over the translational mode of x.

8

is g. following [8], it is simply to suggest what the wilson factor should be. moreover, the formalism
developed in this paper allows to use the super-space notations. thus, the wilson factor is given by

w[c] = p  exp(cid:16)izc

d adx(cid:17) =



xn=0

inz . . .z d nh( 12) . . . h( n1n) adx( 1)    adx( n) ,

(3.5)

where we use the super-space notations namely, d = d d, h( nm) = h(nm) + nm(nm), xi =
x i + i, d =   . as in the bosonic case the noncommutative multiplication law is dened in
terms of the translational modes of x i.
it is a simple matter to check that the expression (3.5) is almost gauge invariant as well as to compute
the partition function in the leading order in . the result is again given by the noncommutative yang-
mills action (see eq.(3.4)). it is also straightforward to t the non-abelian case into the above denition
just by doing in the same way way as we did in the bosonic case.

4 concluding comments

motivated by our experience with the -model, we would like to propose an exactly gauge invariant
version of the wilson factor within the noncommutative yang-mills theory,

w[c] =

1

v z dp+1xdet g t rp  exp(cid:16)izc

d a x(cid:17) ,

with v =z dp+1xdet g .

some discussions of the wilson factors and dirac-born-infeld action that have some interference

with what we described in above are due to [11].
