abstract generators for the discrete u-duality groups of toroidally compactied
m-theory in d  4 are presented and used to determine the d = 3
u-duality group. this contribution summarizes the results of [1].

1.

introduction and summary

the study of nonperturbative duality symmetries in the last years
has dramatically changed our understanding of string theory. u-duality,
introduced in [2], is one of these symmetries. it was conjectured to be
generated by the target-space duality of td (see [4] for a review) and the
modular group of the torus including the eleventh m-theory direction
[5]. this denition was adopted in the algebraic approach to u-duality
reviewed in [3].

using instead the original conjecture of [2] that takes the hidden sym-
metries of low energy supergravity as a starting point, generators of dis-
crete u-duality in four dimensions may be determined directly. groups
in higher dimensions can be found by embeddings, and a method to
determine the d = 3 u-duality is presented. applied to a toy model
corresponding to a truncation of m-theory, the method is seen to give a
signicantly dierent result than for the full theory.

u-duality in four dimensions

compactifying eleven dimensional supergravity, the low energy limit
of m-theory, on t7 yields 70 scalars arising from the d = 11 3-form
potential and the moduli of the torus. they may be joint in a eld
v (4)  e7(+7)/su (8) [7], a representation matrix in the fundamental
56 representation. furthermore, 28 u (1) gauge elds arise from the

1

d = 11 potential and metric. these elds and their magnetic duals can
be arranged to 28 dimensional vectors g and h, ,  = 0 . . . 3.

the equations of motion of the theory are invariant under classical

e7(+7) duality and local su (8) transformations, acting as

f  1f, v (4)  h v (4),   e7(+7), h  su (8)

where f t = (g, h)t. dening charges z = h f, the dsz quanti-
zation condition breaks e7(+7) to a discrete subgroup inducing integer
shifts on the charge lattice. this group is the u-duality group and
was proposed to extend to a nonperturbative quantum symmetry of m-
theory.

to make u-duality transformations manageable in d = 4, the 56
representation needs to be addressed. this can be done by an embedding
into e8(+8) using freudenthals realization of exceptional lie algebras [8].
the e8(+8) generators are given by ei
i, j = 1 . . . 9, corresponding to
sl9, and eijk, e 
ijk. their commutators are given in [1]. dening the
basis

i, j = 2 . . . 8, the adjoint action of the e7(+7) subalgebra on x s exactly
spans the 56 representation as dened in [7]. the basis (1.1) can there-
fore be used to study u-duality transformations on f and v (4), as well
as its subgroups t-duality and s-duality.

what are the generators of e7(+7)(z)? using the fact that the 56
representation of e7(+7) is the unique minimal representation of e7(+7),
it may be proven using the birkho decomposition of lie groups that
the subgroup of e7(+7) inducing integer shifts on the lattice dened by
s is generated by fundamental unipotents1, that is, the action of the
discrete subgroup is spanned by exponentiating the chevalley generators
for all positive and negative roots. from these, t and s generators may
be built parallel to sl(2, z), the latter carrying a representation of the
weyl group modulo z2. this together with the basis s yields contact to
the algebraic approach to m-theory, and it may be shown that the two
approaches are equivalent.

since the notion of the above generators is representation indepen-
dent, the discrete u-duality groups of higher dimensional theories follow
directly from truncating the dynkin diagram. their representations are
minimal and can be read o from s.

1see [9], where this group is dened in a more general context as homeomorphism of the
group ring over z to z.

2.1

u-duality in three dimensions

the d = 3 theory is known to have classical e8(+8) symmetry. as only
scalars remain in the theory, the notion of electric charge seems ill dened
and the meaning of a duality symmetry seems unclear. therefore, in
order to dene u-duality in d = 3, a method proposed in [2] parallel to
[6] may be extended to m-theory. by compactifying m-theory on the
torus, we can choose eight dierent ways how to compactify rst to four
dimensions. this results in eight e7(+7)(z)s acting dierently on m-
theory elds. by reducing the theory further to three dimensions, these
groups are merged together to form the three dimensional duality group.

the reduction to d = 3 yields a scalar coset matrix of the form

v (3) = v (4) exp (cid:16) 1

8

x

i=1

hi(cid:17) exp (cid:16)y  s(cid:17) exp (cid:16)f e1

9(cid:17).

(1.2)

v (4) is identical to v (4), but now in the 248 adjoint representation of
e8(+8). y obeys  = gz,   = hz, y = (, )t, ,  = 0 . . . 2
and therefore carries the d = 4 charges, where z is the compact fourth
direction.  and f are the d = 3 dilaton and dualized kk eld strength
respectively, and hi represents the sl9 cartan subalgebra.

a   e7(+7)  e8(+8) transformation acts on v (4) and y exactly as
discussed in the last section. it therefore represents the d = 4 u-duality
in d = 3. completing a circle around vortex solutions in d = 3 may be
seen to correspond to an e7(+7)(z) action on the elds, parallel to [6].
the dierent compactications yield 8 dierent coset matrices in d =
3. using explicitly the connection to m-theory elds, it can be seen that
they are related by

v (3)
#n = (pns1

n)1 hn v (3)

#1 pns1

n

where hn is a local transformation restoring upper triangular paramete-
rization, s1
n corresponds to a weyl reection and pn corresponds to a
charge conjugation in d = 4. denoting the d = 4 u-duality generators
of the nth compactication by , the total d = 3 u-duality is given by
joining all generators

pns1

n  (pns1

n)1

for all n. this can be seen to yield the whole e8(+8)(z) dened by ex-
ponentiating all chevalley generators. the intersection of two dierent
d = 4 u-dualities is seen to be e6(+6)(z) as expected. this determines
u-duality in d = 3.

2.2

g2(+2) as toy model

the described method to generate d = 3 u-duality can also be ap-
plied to ve dimensional simple supergravity as toy model, which upon
reduction to three dimensions exhibits a g2(+2) global symmetry [10].
it is known that this theory closely resembles d = 11 supergravity in
many respects and corresponds to a direct truncation. the analogue of
u-duality in d = 4 is sl(2, z), acting in the spin 3/2 representation.

here, the joint u-duality u (z) in d = 3 is strictly smaller than
g2(+2)(z) dened by exponentiating the chevalley generators for all
roots. all generators of u (z) correspond to short roots of g2(+2)(z).
that the groups do not agree is therefore connected to the fact that
g2(+2) is not simply laced. since no string compactication described
by this no-moduli supergravity at low energies is known, one cannot
determine which group is the correct u-duality group until such a
description has been found.
