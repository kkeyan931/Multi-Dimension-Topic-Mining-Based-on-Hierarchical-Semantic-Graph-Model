we here consider a generalization of the klein-gordon scalar wave equation which involves a
single arbitrary function. the quantization may be viewed as allowing h to be a function of the
momentum or wave vector rather than a constant. the generalized theory is most easily viewed
in the wave vector space analog of the lagrangian. we need no reference to spacetime.
in the
generalized theory the de broglie relation between wave vector and momentum is generalized, as
are the canonical commutation relations and the uncertainty principle. the generalized uncertainty
principle obtained is the same as has been derived from string theory, or by a general consideration
of gravitational eects during the quantum measurement process. the propagator of the scalar eld
is also generalized, and an illustrative example is given in which it factors into the usual propagator
times a propagator form factor.

early in the history of quantum mechanics de broglie [1] suggested that a wave might be associated with a particle

such as an electron, and that the wave vector ~k be related to the momentum ~p by

i. introduction

or, in terms of the wavelength,

~k =

~p
h

,

 =

2h
|~p|

.

(1.1)

(1.2)

this ad hoc suggestion is widely considered as an important step leading to the schroedinger equation and nonrela-
tivistic quantum mechanics.

in this work we study a generalization of this relation. the generalization may be viewed as allowing h to be a
function of the momentum or the wave vector, or more precisely as a function of the square of the four-momentum
or wave vector; that is we take h  hg(p2) or equivalently h  hf (k2). in this paper we study this in the context
of a generalized klein-gordon or scalar wave equation, which we study in both spacetime, where it may have an
arbitrarily large number of derivatives, and also in wave vector space, where it contains the arbitrary function f (k2).
we emphasize that the analysis is particularly simple and logically complete in wave vector space, and that spacetime
need not be considered at all.

the generalized de broglie relation leads to a modied canonical commutation relation between position and mo-
mentum, and that in turn leads to a generalized uncertainty principle, or gup. the gup is the same as that obtained
in string theory by veneziano and other authors [2]; it has also been obtained from a very general consideration of
gravitational eects in the quantum measurement process [3]. since we obtain the gup here without reference to
gravity we may speculate that there is some connection between the generalized de broglie relation and gravity, or
that gravity is somehow generated by intrinsic quantum eects [4].

lastly we very briey consider interaction of the scalar eld with a given external scalar eld in the context of
wave vector space. of course the propagator of the scalar eld is generalized, and with one illustrative choice of the
function f (k2), we show that the generalized propagator is equal to the usual propagator times a propagator form
factor. the form factor has the form of the propagator of a virtual particle of planck mass.

some time ago snyder [5] considered the idea of a quantized or discretized spacetime. his ideas are equivalent
to our modied de broglie relation, but his motivation was dierent from ours. recently, from a somewhat dierent
perspective, some of our results have been derived by kempf and collaborators [6]. in particular, they obtain our
results regarding commutators and uncertainty relations and construct a theory that is regular in the ultraviolet. our
philosophy and approach in the present work is dierent than theirs, and we treat interactions dierently.

ii. the scalar wave equation in spacetime

we rst recall briey some simple properties of the scalar wave equation in spacetime. throughout we use units in

which c = 1 but take pains to retain h explicitly. the lagrangian density for a noninteracting or free scalar eld is

l = h2(x)

,(x),   m2(x)(x) , (x), 

(x)
x ,

(2.1)

where  is the lorentz metric with signature (1,-1,-1,-1), and the scalar eld and its conjugate are treated as
independent variables. from this the euler-lagrange equations are

and similarly for the conjugate. as a solution we seek a plane wave of the form

h2(x), , + m2(x) = 0 ,

(x) = 0eik x

.

(2.2)

(2.3)

here the wave vector k is a set of four real parameters. substitution of this into the wave equation (2.2) shows it is
a solution if

h2(kk  )  h2k2 = m2

(2.4)

special relativity tells us that the four-momentum squared of a particle is equal to its mass squared, p2 = m2.
comparing this with (2.4) we naturally assume the wave vector is related to the momentum by k = p/h , which
we refer to as the de broglie relation. this is not the most general solution, as we will discuss in section iv. in
particular the de broglie relation implies the usual relation between the wavelength  = 2/|~k| and the magnitude of
the three-momentum p = |~p|

 =

2h

p

.

(2.5)

since the wave vector may be identied with the derivative operator i/x this gives the standard operator expression
for momentum in a position representation, and the standard commutation relation

p = ih


x ,

[x, p] = ih .

(2.6)

in a section iv we will modify and generalize the equations in this section.

iii. the scalar wave equation in wave vector space

it is interesting to express the action principle for elds in the space of wave vectors, without reference to spacetime.
this is an elementary exercise in fourier transforms, but the physical viewpoint is dierent, and may allow more
exibility and insight when seeking modications of present theories. we use the scalar eld to illustrate this. the
action is dened as the integral of the lagrangian in spacetime,

s =z d4xl[(x), (x),] ,

2

(3.1)

where the integral may be taken over all space, and time from an initial time, ti, to a nal time, tf . (dependence of
the lagrangian on the conjugate eld is implicit.) in particular we may take ti   and tf   so the integral is
over all spacetime. if we fourier transform the eld in spacetime (x) to wave vector space (k) by

(x) =z

d4k
(2)4

(k)eikx ,

then the action may be expressed in terms of an analog of the lagrangian in wave vector space,

s =z

d4k
(2)4 k[ (k), k (k)] , k[ (k), k (k)]  h2[k (k)][k (k)]  m2 (k) (k) .

(3.2)

(3.3)

to obtain the appropriate dynamical equations in wave vector space we extremize the action with respect to
variations of the elds. this can be done in two equivalent ways. in the rst way we take the elds, (k) and (k),
and the product of the wave vector and the elds,k (k) and k (k), as independent variables; this may appear
somewhat articial, but it is the analog of treating the eld (x) and its derivatives (x), as independent variables
in spacetime, and is useful for formal manipulations. extremizing in this way we obtain

s =z

d4k

(2)4 "  k

 (k)

 (k) +

k

(k (k))

(k (k))! +  k

 (k)

 (k) +

k

(k (k))

(k (k))!# = 0 .

(3.4)

since the variations of the elds are arbitrary, and since (k (k)) = k (k), this leads to an analog of the euler-
lagrange equations

k
 (k)

+

k

(k (k))

k = 0 ,

(3.5)

and similarly for the conjugate.

alternatively, in the second way, we treat the elds as the independent variables, however they occur in k, and

obtain

s =z

d4k

(2)4 "(cid:18) k

 (k)(cid:19)t

 (k) +(cid:18) k

 (k)(cid:19)t

 (k)# = 0 ,

where the subscript t denotes a total derivative. thus the anolog of the euler-lagrange equations is

(cid:18) k
 (k)(cid:19)t

= 0 ,

(3.6)

(3.7)

and similarly for the conjugate. this is obviously the same as (3.5). for the scalar lagrangian (3.3) we vary the
action with respect to the conjugate eld and obtain explicitly

the solution to this may be expressed as

(cid:18) k
 (k)(cid:19)t

= (h2k2  m2) (k) = 0 ,

(k) = 2(cid:18)k0 q~k2 + m2/h2(cid:19) +(~k) + 2(cid:18)k0 +q~k2 + m2/h2(cid:19) (~k) ,

(3.8)

(3.9)

where the + and  are arbitrary functions of the three-vector momentum. this corresponds to a superposition of
plane wave solutions of the form (2.3).

we may consider the variational principle in wave vector space, in terms of the function k, as the fundamental basis
of the theory, and thereby make no explicit reference to spacetime. this may have some conceptual or philosophical
merit in that experiments in particle physics are generally scattering experiments and are more directly related to
the momenta of particles rather than their position. it may also be possible that such a viewpoint might allow easier
generalizations of the theory, as we will discuss in the next section.

iv. a generalization of the theory

it has long been a supposed fact of life that the dierential equations of physics are rst or second order. this is
well born out by experience in that classical mechanics, classical electromagnetism, general relativity, nonrelativitstic
quantum mechanics, relativistic quantum mechanics, and all the equations of the standard model of particles are at
most of second order. but it may well be that we also have developed an unjustied bias in favor of second order
equations due to mathematical convenience. as such it is particularly interesting to consider higher order equations
with all their inherent dangers and diculties with boundary conditions. motivated thereby, we consider the following
generalization of the scalar wave equation [7],

h2( 2  al2

p 4 + . . .)(x) + m2(x) = 0 ,  2  

 2

xx ,  4   2 2 , etc.

(4.1)

here lp is a characteristic distance, presumably of the order of the planck distance, and a is a dimensionless parameter
of order 1, with either sign. the series represents any reasonable function with a power series expansion. this equation
does not t easily into the action formalism in spacetime since it may be of innite order in derivatives. if the series
is innite this equation is, in a sense, nonlocal.

we can easily nd plane wave solutions of the form (2.3). these are solutions if

 h2k2(1 + al2

pk2 + . . .) + m2  h2k2f 2(k2) + m2 = 0 .

as before we note that special relativity tells us that p2 = m2, so that

h2k2f 2(k2) = p2 .

(4.2)

(4.3)

since f 2(k2) is a scalar and the wave vector and the momentum are four-vectors the quotient theorem tell us that
they are related by a second rank tensor,

p = t

k .

(4.4)

substitution of this into (4.3) shows that the tensor t
or

 must be a scalar multiple of an element of the lorentz group,

t

 = hf (k2)

 , 

 

 =  .

(4.5)

the simplest choice for 
we accordingly assume, in direct analogy with the assumption in section ii, a generalized de broglie relation

, and the only one that does not depend on some intrisic parameter, is the identity 
 .

this implies in particular that the wavelength of the particle is given by

p = hf (k2)k .

 =

2h

p

f (k2) .

(4.6)

(4.7)

such a modication may not be easy to test experimentally since the wavelengths of particles in scattering experiments
are not generally observed, and at suciently high energies may not even be observable in principle.

it is amusing to note that the above generalization of the theory may be viewed as allowing plancks constant to
become a function of the wave vector squared, or equivalently the mass of the associated free particle. it is for this
reason that we retain it explicitly as a bookkeeping tool in all equations.

our consideration of the generalized scalar wave equation is not dicult, but is slightly cumbersome in the spacetime
lagrangian formalism. it amounts to making the substitution h  hf ( 2).
in wave vector space however it is
extremely simple and natural. we may view the generalization as multiplying the wave vector by f (k2) or equivalently
as allowing plancks constant to be a scalar function via h  hf (k2); in either view we substitue hk  hkf (k2), so
the function k in (3.3) is modied to

the wave equation is then

k = (k)[h2f 2(k2)k2  m2] (k) .

[h2f 2(k2)k2  m2] (k) = 0 ,

4

(4.8)

(4.9)

and the solution is

(k) = 2(cid:18)k0 q~k2 + m2/h2f 2(cid:19) +(~k) + 2(cid:18)k0 +q~k2 + m2/h2f 2(cid:19) (~k) ,

(4.10)

which is the obvious generalization of (3.9).

one might expect that the generalized de broglie relation (4.6) would lead to a change in the dispersion relation
for the velocity of a massive free particle. it can however be easily seen that this is not the case. from (4.3) with
p2 = m2 we have

the group or particle velocity is then given by

h2f 2(k2)k2 = m2  k2 = (k0)2  ~k2 = constant .

which is independent of the function f (k2).

vg =

dk0
d|~k|

=

|~k|
k0 =

|~p|
p0 ,

(4.11)

(4.12)

v. generalized commutation relation

the generalized de broglie relation (4.6) leads to a modication of the canonical position-momentum commutation
relation of quantum mechanics. this may be obtained as follows. the commutation relation between the position and
wave vector operators is evident, since the wave vector k may be expressed as the derivative i/x in the position
representation, and thus

alternatively, in the wave vector representation, the position operator may be expressed as x = i/k. then the
commutator of x and p can be written as

[x, k] = i
 .

(5.1)

[x, p] = [i


k

, p] = i

p
k

.

we may calculate the indicated derivatives from (4.6) and obtain

[x, p] = ih [f 

 + 2f kk]

f  

df
dk2 .

to obtain this entirely in terms of momentum we dene g(p2)  f (k2), and use (4.3) and (4.6) to get

[x, p] = ih(cid:20)g

 +

2gpp

1  2gp2/g(cid:21) ,

g

as an explicit example suppose that to lowest order

f = 1 + al2

then the commutation relation takes the simple form, to lowest order,

[x, p] = ih(cid:20)

(5.2)

(5.5)

(5.6)

where mp  h/lp.

we note parenthetically that the above results may also be obtained directly in the position representation by using

and assuming a power series representation for f , but the derivation is somewhat more tedious than the above.

p = ihf ( 2)

vi. the generalized uncertainty principle

the commutation relation obtained in the previous section leads immediately to a generalization of the heisenberg
uncertainty principle, variously called the extended uncertainty principle, or the gravitational uncertainty principle,
or the generalized uncertainty principle (gup). we recall that the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics gives
the product of the variances of two observables (or hermitian operators) a and b in terms of their commutator,

(a)2(b)2 

1
4

|h[a, b]i|2 .

(6.1)

the variances are for a series of measurements of the observables and the expectation value is for whatever state is
being measured. we apply this to the position and momentum operators in the x direction and use the approximate
relation (v) from the preceding section, with  =  = 1, to obtain

xp 

h

2 (cid:18)1 +

am2
m2
p



2a
m2
p

xi(cid:19) .

(6.2)

consider now an ordinary particle such as an electron with m  mp at rest, with momentum expectation equal to
zero. if it is subjected to a position measurement localizing its position to a very small region its momentum spread
will be very large. then, since

p2

x = hp2

xi

equation (6.2) becomes

(6.3)

(6.4)

this is precisely the gup, as usually obtained in string theory [2] or by consideration of gravitational eects in
a quantum measurement process [3]. moreover, for agreement with the usual gup as discussed below, we choose
a  1.

vii. speculation on gravity

the gup is a well-known result of string theory [2], and is related to the interesting physical notions of duality and
a minimum length [8]. it can be obtained in considerable generality using only basic concepts of quantum mechanics
and gravity as is done in references [3] and [9]. a very brief derivation using dimensional arguments may be made as
follows: consider a photon being used to measure the position of an electron, as in the classic discussion of heisenberg
[10]. in addition to the usual quantum mechanical position uncertainty, x  h/p, there must be an uncertainty
due to the gravitational eld of the photon. the extra uncertainty should accordingly be linear in the gravitational
constant g and in the energy or momentum of the photon. moreover, the momentum of the photon should be of the
order the uncertainty in the electron momentum, so the extra term should be proportional to gp. thus the gup
must be, on dimensional grounds,

x 

h
p

+ l2
p

p
h

.

(7.1)

this is in qualitative agreement with (6.4).

in the derivation of the gup in section vi we made no mention of gravity, but have obtained the result form
the generalized de broglie relation and the consequent commutation relation. we are led to speculate that the
generalization may in some way generate gravity. in this view gravity may not be a fundamental force, but instead, it
may be generated by quantum eects. this is not unreasonable physically: general relativistic gravity is characterized
by its breaking of translational invariance in spacetime, and in a similar way a nonconstant function f (k2) breaks the
translational invariance of the action in wave vector space.

a suggestion that is similar in spirit was made long ago by sakharov [4], who speculated that gravity may not be
fundamental, but induced by the residual eects of fundamental quantum elds on the vacuum, with the lagrangian
playing the role an elastic stress. such a view of gravity has the merit of providing some understanding of why gravity
is so weak. in the sakharov view gravity is weak because the planck scale provides an energy momentum cuto that
is very large. in the present view gravity is weak because the relation between momentum and wave number diers
from linear only for very large momenta.

6

viii. interactions

although the main parts of this paper deal with a free scalar eld, it should be emphasized that interactions are
easily accomadated in the context of wave vector space. as a simple example of this we consider an interaction in the
spacetime lagrangian of the form

li = g(x)(x)(x) ,

(8.1)

where  is a given external eld and g is a coupling constant. the lagrangian function in wave vector space is then
modied from (4.8) to

k = (k)[h2f 2(k2)k2  m2] (k)  gz

d4l
(2)4

(k + l) (k) (l) .

(8.2)

that is, the point interaction term becomes a convolution, so the interaction is nonlocal in wave vector space. the
extremum condition, (3.5) or (3.7), then is an integral equation

[h2f (k2)k2  m2] (k) = gz

d4l
(2)4

(k  l) (l) ,

(8.3)

where we have made a shift of l in the wave vector space. this is easily solved by a perturbation expansion of (k)
of the form

we substitute this into (8.3) and get a set of iterative equations

(k) = 0(k) + g 1(k) + . . . =xn

gn n(k) , .

[h2f (k2)k2  m2] n(k) = gz

d4l
(2)4

n1(k  l) (l) .

as the zeroth order or unperturbed solution we naturally choose an eigenstate of the wave vector ki,

and obtain the series solution

0(k) = (2)4(k  ki) ,

(k) = (2)4(k  ki) + g

this we recognize as the usual feynman expansion, but with a modied propagator given by

.

(8.4)

(8.5)

(8.6)

(8.7)

(8.8)

as an illustrative example let us take the function f to be linear, as in (5.5), but expressed in terms of the planck

we note parenthetically that the momentum of the particle will become zero when k2 = m2

(8.8) and (8.9), we obtain the propagator

d(k2) =

p!(cid:18)

h2k2  m2(cid:19) .

(8.11)

(8.12)

that is, a form factor factor appears as multiplying the usual propagator. such a form factor is usually associated
with a modication of the vertex in quantum eld theories, but here it appears as a result of the modied de broglie
relation.

further discussion of quantum eld theories and perturbation theory, in particular gauge theories, will follow in

another paper.

ix. summary

we have generalized the de broglie relation (1.1) to the four-vector relation (4.6), which involves an arbitrary scalar
function. thus the wavelength of a particle of a given momentum depends on its invariant mass. this was done in the
context of the klein-gordon or scalar wave equation. in spacetime the generalized equation contains an arbitrarily
large number of derivatives; in a formalism involving a lagrangian type function in wave vector space the derivation
is simpler and more natural. we emphasize that the wave vector space formalism is more closely related to actual
laboratory experiments in high energy scattering, and that spacetime on a small scale need not even exist in this
point of view.

as a result of the generalized de broglie relation the canonical commutation relations are modied, and lead
to a generalized uncertainty principle (gup). since the gup may otherwise be obtained from a consideration of
gravitational eects in the quantum measurement process the question naturally arises as to whether gravity may in
some way be related to, or generated by, quantum eects, and not be an independent fundamental force.

interactions are easily accomodated in the wave vector space formalism. a feynman type expansion for the scalar
eld with a modied propagator was given as an example. further studies will deal with perturbative eld theories,
especially with gauge theories such as qed.

this work was supported by nasa grant nas 8-39225 to gravity probe b. finally the gravity probe b theory

group at stanford provided many stimulating discussions.
