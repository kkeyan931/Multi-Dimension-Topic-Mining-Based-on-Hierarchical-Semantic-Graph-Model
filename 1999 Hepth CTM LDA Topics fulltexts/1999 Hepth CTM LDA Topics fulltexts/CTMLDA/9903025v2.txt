abstract

the one-loop eective action for general trajectories of d-particles in matrix theory is

calculated in the expansion with respect to the number of derivatives up to six, which

gives the equation of motion consistently. the result shows that the terms with six

derivatives vanish for straight-line trajectories, however, they do not vanish in general.

this provides a concrete example that non-renormalization of twelve-fermion terms does

not necessarily imply that of six-derivative terms.

introduction

to construct a consistent quantum theory including gravity is one of the most important

problems in theoretical physics today. the most natural approach, namely the second

quantization of the metric eld, has turned out to suer from non-renormalizability. we

have to search for another way to describe gravity which reconciles controllable behavior

in the short-distance region with general covariance in the low-energy region.

matrix theory [1], which was proposed as a matrix model for m theory [2], provided a

novel possibility of quantum description of gravity based on the description of dirichlet

branes [3] in terms of the super yang-mills theory [4, 5]. the eective action of d-

particles in matrix theory calculated in the loop expansion is in precise agreement with

that obtained from the eleven-dimensional supergravity in the low-energy region up to two

loops [6, 7, 8, 9]. however, we only understand the reason why gravity could emerge in

matrix theory indirectly through the superstring theory which underlies matrix theory. it

is desirable to understand the reason within the framework of the super yang-mills theory.

the supersymmetries of the model certainly play an important role there. however, it

is still uncertain to what extent the eective action of matrix theory is constrained by

them. it would be necessary to investigate the nature of interactions described by matrix

theory from various viewpoints for deeper understanding.

the one-loop eective action of matrix theory has been discussed from many aspects.

in particular, it was shown that it produces interactions of the linearized supergravity

between an arbitrary pair of m-theory excitations [10] including the eects of arbitrary

background congurations of the fermionic eld in matrix theory [11]. besides the con-

tribution which corresponds to the supergravity, the one-loop eective action of matrix

theory contains higher-derivative corrections. this is not unexpected since matrix theory

is a model for m theory, not for the supergravity: it must contain corrections to the

supergravity in the short-distance region. the higher-derivative corrections at one loop

can be considered as a part of such corrections. the primary purpose of the present paper

is to investigate these corrections at one loop.

in investigating them, we want to extract information on interaction lagrangian from

the scattering phase shift, which is the quantity we can rst obtain from matrix-theory

2

calculations, with the criterion that the lagrangian should produce the phase shift cor-

rectly. we rst point out an ambiguity in this procedure which is related to the dierence

between the time in matrix theory and that in the lagrangian, and then x it with an

assumption that the two coincide. this assumption ensures that the equation of motion

of d-particles [9] is consistently derived from the lagrangian. the result indicates that

the interaction lagrangian contains terms with six derivatives at one loop.

this observation raises an interesting question related to the constraints imposed by

the supersymmetries. it was shown by paban, sethi and stern [12, 13] that eight- and

twelve-fermion terms can appear only at one loop and at two loops, respectively. since

eight- and twelve-fermion terms belong to the same multiplets of the supersymmetries

as four- and six-derivative terms, respectively, their results indicate that the latter terms

are strongly constrained by the supersymmetries as well. however, if there really exist

six-derivative terms at one loop, the mechanism which constrains the six-derivative terms

would be more complicated than that for the twelve-fermion terms.

these motivate us to develop systematic methods to investigate higher-derivative

terms in the eective action of matrix theory. we explicitly calculate the one-loop ef-

fective action for general trajectories of d-particles in the expansion with respect to the

number of derivatives up to six hoping that the result provides a basis for future studies

to understand the role of the supersymmetries and the reason why gravity could emerge

in matrix theory.

the organization of the paper is as follows.

in section 2, after pointing out the

ambiguity in determining the interaction lagrangian from the phase shift, we argue that

there exist six-derivative terms at one loop under the assumption that the time in matrix

theory coincides with that in the lagrangian. we then determine the complete form of

the interaction lagrangian up to six derivatives by calculating the eective action for

general trajectories of d-particles in section 3. section 4 is devoted to the conclusions

and discussions.

2. extraction of interaction lagrangian from scattering phase shift

let us reconsider the procedure to extract information on the interaction lagrangian from

the scattering phase shift of d-particles in matrix theory. matrix theory is dened by

the action of the super yang-mills theory dimensionally reduced from 9+1 dimensions to

0+1 dimension [1]

where g is the yang-mills coupling constant and n, m = 1, 2,   , 9 stand for transverse
dimensions. x n
ij(t), aij(t) and ij(t) are n  n hermitian-matrix elds. eigenvalues of
the bosonic eld x n(t) are interpreted as transverse coordinates of d-particles and the

fermionic eld (t) is an so(9) majorana spinor which represents spins of d-particles. we

take a representation of so(9) gamma matrices n such that n are real and symmetric
satisfying {n, m} = 2nm.

we will perform our computations in euclidean formulation, dening the euclidean

time  and gauge eld in euclidean time a as

the euclidean action is then

(2.7)

the one-loop eective action (1) is obtained from the functional determinant of the

action for general trajectories of d-particles based on (2.11). we will concentrate on a

pair of d-particles and omit the subscripts such as ij in what follows.

(2.16)

(2.17)

this phase shift (2.16) precisely coincides with the one coming from the following

interaction lagrangian in the eikonal approximation:

l = c4

v4
r7 + c6

v6
r11 + c8

v8
r15 + o(v10).

(2.18)

in fact, the integration over  after substituting the straight-line trajectory (2.12) into

(2.18) gives

v7
b14 + o(v9).

(2.19)

the coecients of the terms in the lagrangian (2.18) can be determined by comparing

two expressions (2.16) and (2.19). thus, we obtain the lagrangian

l =

v4

v6
r11 

9009
4096

v8
r15 + o(v10),

(2.20)

which yields the phase shift (2.16).

6

however, this is not the unique lagrangian which gives the phase shift (2.16). for

example, there are four possible terms which contain six derivatives if we allow interactions
of the form v  r:

z 



d "a

v6
r11 + b

v4(v  r)2

r13

+ c

v2(v  r)4

r15

+ d

(v  r)6
r17 # .

(2.21)

since the integration over  after substituting the straight-line trajectory (2.12) into (2.21)

gives

256
45045

(143a + 13b + 3c + d)

v5
b10 ,

(2.22)

the vanishing contribution proportional to v5/b10 in (2.16) only requires a relation among

the coecients

143a + 13b + 3c + d = 0.

(2.23)

the term which we took in (2.20) is only a special one which satises the relation (2.23).

thus, the criterion that the interaction lagrangian should produce the phase shift (2.16)

correctly alone cannot determine the form of the lagrangian uniquely. we need some

assumptions or further physical inputs to determine them.

it should be noted that this ambiguity is related to the dierence between the time

 in the matrix-theory eective action (2.13) and that in the lagrangian such as (2.20)

or (2.21). for example, the value of the lagrangian (2.20) for the conguration (2.12)

depends on  only through a combination r( ) = v2 2 + 2v  x + x2. the  -dependence

of (1) (2.13) is dierent from the above form and therefore the two  s in (1) (2.13) and

(2.20) are dierent when we interpret that the phase shift (2.16) is coming from the

lagrangian (2.20).

now, realizing the dierence between the two  s, a natural assumption in determining

the form of the interaction lagrangian is that the time  in the interaction lagrangian
should be equal to  appeared in (1). this assumption ensures that the equation of motion

of d-particles calculated in the one-loop approximation in [9] is consistently derived from

the resultant lagrangian. in general, it is not obvious how the equation of motion derived
from another lagrangian such as (2.20) is related to the variational equation /rn( ) =

0 in matrix theory because of the dierence of the time. this assumption seems plausible

naively because the action of matrix theory originates in the low-energy eective action

7

of d-particles in the type iia superstring theory in the gauge that the parametrization

of the trajectories of d-particles is equal to the time in ten-dimensional space-time.

under the above assumption, the form of the lagrangian is uniquely determined. the
integrand of (1) (2.13) should be rewritten in the form which depends on  through the

following combinations:

r( )2 = v2 2 + 2v  x + x2,
v  r( ) = v2 + v  x.

(2.24)

it follows that x2 should be replaced with r2  v2 2  2v  x and the remaining v  x with
v  r  v2 . after these replacements,  must appear only within r( )2 or v  r( ) in order
for the assumption to be consistent. it is indeed the case for (, ,  )

(, ,  ) = s

exp"
and (1) (2.13) is rewritten as follows:

2 sinh(2v)

(2.27)

the terms with six derivatives in (2.27) satisfy the relation (2.23) so that the phase shift
(2.16) is reproduced correctly up to v6 as it should be.

the rst term in (2.27) proportional to v4/r7 is the familiar one which corresponds

to the supergravity contribution [1, 6, 7]. the appearance of the terms which contain six

derivatives is interesting from the aspect of the supersymmetric constraint as mentioned in

section 1. it was shown that twelve-fermion terms without derivatives only appear at two-

loop eective action [13] and this statement is often referred as the non-renormalization

of twelve-fermion terms. this in particular implies that there are no twelve-fermion

terms at one loop. although the six-derivative terms belong to the same multiplet of

8

the supersymmetries as the twelve-fermion terms because the number of derivatives plus

half of the number of fermions is the same, the appearance of the six-derivative terms

at one loop does not contradict the non-renormalization of twelve-fermion terms if the

supersymmetric completion of the six-derivative terms is achieved without twelve-fermion

terms. this can happen and in fact the tree-level eective action provides a simpler

example of such cases

(0) = z 



d " 1

2g2 v2 +

1

2g2  # ,

(2.28)

where  is the fermionic background. there is a two-derivative term but no four-fermion

terms. the same thing can happen for four- or six-derivative terms at higher loops

and such possibility is not excluded by the arguments put forward so far. therefore,

the non-renormalization of eight- or twelve-fermion terms itself does not ensure the non-

renormalization of four- or six-derivative terms, respectively. if there really exist the six-

derivative terms in the one-loop eective action (2.27), this provides a concrete example.

this argument shows the importance of the question whether there exist six-derivative

terms in the one-loop eective action.

the expression (2.27) indicates that there are six-derivative terms, however, it is not

conclusive yet: the terms might be arranged to a total derivative if there are appropriate

terms which contain acceleration. we can present evidence in favor of the fact that there

do exist six-derivative terms at one loop from the result of the one-point proper function

calculated in the one-loop approximation [9]. the one-point proper function is nothing

but the recoil acceleration n( ) [9]:

n( ) =

(2.29)

using the expression of (, ,  ) in terms of r( )2 and v  r( ) (2.25), the explicit form
of n( ) in the expansion with respect to v is given by

+ o(v7).

(2.30)

the rst two terms in (2.30) precisely coincide with the contributions coming from the

euler-lagrange equation derived from the rst term in (2.27). the fact that there are

non-vanishing terms with six derivatives in (2.30) shows that the six-derivative terms in

(2.27) cannot be arranged to a total derivative.

we want to comment here that the equation of motion derived from another la-

grangian such as (2.20) does not coincide with (2.30) because of the dierence of the

time.

it may be possible to make them coincide if we properly redene the time in

(2.30). however, the time in the other lagrangians such as (2.20) is not simply related
to that in (1) (2.13) in general. in fact, an eective way to obtain (2.20) is the following
transformation of  after exchanging the order of integrations between  and  in (1):

 = s tanh(v)

v

(cid:18) +

x  v

then, (1) is expressed using  as

(2.31)

(2.32)

with r( ) = v2 2 + 2v  x + x2. the coecients in (2.20) is reproduced by expanding

the integrand of (2.32) with respect to v and performing the integration over . the

peculiar relation (2.31) which depends on v and  enforces a signicant change of the
usual interpretation that eigenvalues of hx n( )i represent the transverse positions of d-
particles at the time  since we have to use  as time when we adopt the lagrangian (2.20).

it is uncertain whether such change of the interpretation makes sense, but we believe that

our assumption that the time in the lagrangian coincides with that in the eective action

of matrix theory is the natural one which automatically ensures the consistency between

the lagrangian and the equation of motion.

the argument presented here shows that there do exist six-derivative terms in the one-
loop eective action (1). however, the calculations performed so far cannot determine

10

the complete form of the six-derivative terms since the eective action for the straight-line

trajectories cannot detect terms with second or higher derivative of coordinate. in the

next section, we will compute the eective action for general trajectories and determine
them, which is possible under our assumption that the time in (1) is equal to that in the

lagrangian.

3. one-loop eective action for general trajectories in derivative expan-

sion

we cannot evaluate the one-loop eective action (2.11) exactly for general background

congurations so that we calculate it in the expansion with respect to the number of

derivatives up to six. let us introduce the following abbreviations to simplify expressions:

rn  2

 rn( ),

   ,

rn   rn( ),
1
 

 + r( )2 .

2

(3.1)

then, the one-loop eective action (2.11) is concisely expressed as

(1) = tr ln(1  4 rn rn) 

1
2

tr ln(1 + r/).

(3.2)

to determine the form of six-derivative terms, we expand the eective action with respect

to the number of s and evaluate the following contributions:

(1) = (1)

2 + (1)

4 + (1)

6 + o(8

 ),

where

1
(1)
2  4tr( rn rn) +
4
1
(1)
4  8tr( rn rn)2 +
8
(1)
tr( rn rn)3 +
6  

64
3

tr( r/)2,

tr( r/)4,

1
12

tr( r/)6.

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

in evaluating them, it is convenient to normal order the expressions rst. by normal

ordering, we mean ordering expressions which contain functions of  , derivatives with

11

respect to  and s to the form f ( )n

 m using the commutation relation [ ,  ] = 1.

the following formulas are useful in the normal ordering:

[ , f ( )] = f( ),
[, f ( )] = ( f ( ) + 2 f ( ) ),

[,  ] = 2(r  r).

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

note that these commutators increase the number of derivatives by at least one. then,

the expressions f ( ) and  are normal ordered as follows:

f ( ) = f ( ) + 2 f ( ) 2 + f( )(1 + 42

 )2

+4 f( )(r  r)3 + o(3
 ),
 =   + 2(r  r)2 + o(2
 ).

(3.10)

(3.11)

we should make a technical but important remark here. when we count the number

of derivatives, we should not count derivatives acting directly on s since they do not

necessarily generate derivatives of coordinate in the nal form as we will see. for example,
we should count the second term on the right-hand side of (3.10) as o( ), not as o(2

 ).

let us begin with (1)

2 and (1)

6 . (1)

2

is shown to vanish

(1)
2 = 0,

which follows from

n
abm

ba = 16nm.

(1)

is easily normal ordered as follows:

(1)
6 = 
then using a/a/ = a21, we have

tr[ r66] +

1
12

tr[ r/66] + o(7

 ).

(1)
6 = 20tr[ r66] + o(7
 ).

we go on to the last one, (1)

4 . it is transformed using

(3.15)

(3.16)

to the following form:

(1)
4 = 4tr( rn rn rm rm)  2tr( rn rm rn rm).

(3.17)

let us normal order the expression tr( rk r rm rn). there are three s to be moved

to the right. one way of doing that is to move the three one by one in the order that the

right one, the middle one and the left one. then, it is normal ordered as follows:

tr( rk r rm rn)

= tr[ rk r rm rn4

+2{ rk r rm[ , rn] + rk r[ , rm rn] + rk[ , r rm rn]} 5
+{ rk r rm[ , [ , rn]] + rk r[ , [ , rm rn]] + rk[ , [ , r rm rn]]}(1 + 42
+{12 rk r rm[ , rn] + 8 rk r[ , rm rn] + 4 rk[ , r rm rn]}(r  r)6
+4{ rk r[ , rm[ , rn]] + rk[ , r rm[ , rn]] + rk[ , r[ , rm rn]]}2
+o(7

(3.18)

this is one of possible normal-ordered expressions. if we perform the normal ordering

in another way, the result will apparently dier from this one. however, the dierence

is an integral of a total derivative and hence it does not aect the nal result. the
normal-ordered expression of (1)
4

is easily derived using the formula (3.18), which is

(1)
4 = tr[6 r44  72 r2( r  r) 5  240 r2( r  r)(r  r)6

(3.19)

next thing which we have to do is to evaluate the quantity h1|n|2i. it is expressed

the last of the formulas (3.31) is an example of the fact that derivatives acting directly

on s do not necessarily generate derivatives of coordinate as we mentioned before.
the nal form of the one-loop eective action (1) up to six derivatives is obtained by

applying these formulas to the normal-ordered expressions (3.12), (3.15) and (3.19). the

the expressions (3.32) and (3.33) are our nal results for the interaction lagrangian.

there are no four-derivative terms other than the one which is already found in the

eective action for straight-line trajectories (2.27). thus, this term is valid not only

for straight-line trajectories but also general ones. this result is consistent with that in

[10, 11] where the eective action for arbitrary background congurations (not restricted

to diagonal ones) is calculated, or that in [14] where four-derivative terms are determined

by calculating the eective action for particular trajectories. the complete form of six-

derivative terms is our new result. it is not dicult to show that this expression cannot

be expressed as a total derivative. as a check of our calculations, we conrmed that

the euler-lagrange equation derived from this lagrangian precisely produces the recoil

acceleration (2.30) where the third term on the right-hand side of (3.33) which contains

acceleration does contribute to (2.30).

4. conclusions and discussions

we calculated the one-loop eective action for general trajectories of d-particles in matrix

theory in the expansion with respect to the number of derivatives up to six. we determined

the form of the interaction lagrangian under the assumption that the time in matrix

theory coincides with that in the lagrangian which ensures that the equation of motion

is consistently derived. we found that there are non-vanishing terms which contain six

derivatives although the value of them at straight-line trajectories vanishes. our result

provides a concrete example that non-renormalization of twelve-fermion terms does not

necessarily imply that of six-derivative terms.

it is possible to calculate higher-derivative terms in the one-loop eective action at any

order following the method developed in section 3. such calculations provide predictions

from matrix theory that m theory should have these corrections to the supergravity ap-

proximation. although these interactions are understood as the remaining  corrections

in the limit discussed in [5, 18, 19] in the viewpoint of the type iia superstring theory, it

is interesting to identify the origin of them in m theory.

although we did not use the supersymmetries manifestly in the calculations, the result

must be supersymmetric if correctly calculated. it is desirable to perform the supersym-

metric completion of the six-derivative terms and see if it does not require twelve-fermion

terms.

our result indicates that the mechanism which ensures the non-renormalization of

terms with four or six derivatives, if it exists, is more complicated than that of eight- or

twelve-fermion terms which was shown in [12, 13]. something more will be required to

prove the non-renormalization of four- or six-derivative terms, in particular, in multi-body

systems as discussed in [20], or in [21] where the possibility of the existence of six-derivative

terms in four-body scattering at three loops is argued. however, these arguments of course

do not claim that terms with four or six derivatives cannot be constrained only by the

supersymmetries, at least for two-body interactions. in fact, the method taken in [12, 13]

makes use of only small part of the potential power of the supersymmetries.

it would

be necessary to exploit more powerful methods to constrain the eective action using the

supersymmetries.

16

as a possible extension of our work, it is interesting to discuss the inuence of the

higher-derivative terms in the one-loop eective action on the generalized conformal sym-

metry proposed in [15] and developed in [16, 17, 14]. the question whether the conformal

transformation is modied by them seems important since the conformal transformation

is closely related to the property of the background metric which is not manifest in matrix

theory.
