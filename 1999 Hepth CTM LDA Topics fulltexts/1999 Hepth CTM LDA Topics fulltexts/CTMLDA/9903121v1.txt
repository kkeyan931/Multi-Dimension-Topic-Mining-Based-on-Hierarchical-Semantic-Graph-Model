abstract

we discuss the brst cohomology and exhibit a connection between the hodge de-
composition theorem and the topological properties of a two dimensional free non-abelian
gauge theory having no interaction with matter elds. the topological nature of this the-
ory is encoded in the vanishing of the laplacian operator when equations of motion are
exploited. we obtain two sets of topological invariants with respect to brst and co-brst
charges on the two dimensional manifold and show that the lagrangian density of the the-
ory can be expressed as the sum of terms that are brst- and co-brst invariants.

1 introduction

the local gauge theories, endowed with the rst class constraints [1,2], play a key role
in the understanding of the basic interactions of nature (except quantum gravity). for
the becchi-rouet-stora-tyutin (brst) quantization of such a class of theories, the local
gauge symmetry transformations of the classical theories are traded with the quantum
gauge brst symmetry transformations which are generated by the conserved ( qb = 0)
and nilpotent (q2
b = 0) brst charge qb [3-5]. in particular, the importance of the brst
formalism comes to its full glory in the context of the covariant canonical quantization
of the non-abelian gauge theory where unitarity and gauge invariance both are respected
together. the presence of the rst class constraints of the original theories is found to be
encoded in the subsidiary condition qb|phys >= 0 which implies that the physical states
are annihilated by these constraints. the above two properties, i.e., the physical state
condition qb|phys >= 0 and the nilpotency of the brst charge q2
b = 0, are the two key
requirements to dene the cohomological aspects of the brst formalism. the inclusion of
the brst symmetry in the batalin-vilkovisky formalism (see, e.g., [6,7]), the discussion
of the second class constraints in its framework [8], its indispensible use in the topological
eld theories [9-11] and string theories, etc., have enriched the physical and mathematical
aspects of the brst formalism to a fairly high degree of sophistication.

one of the most celebrated theorems in the mathematical aspects of the de rham
cohomology is the hodge decomposition theorem dened on a compact manifold [12-14].
this theorem states that any arbitrary form can be written as the sum of a harmonic form,
an exact form and a co-exact form.
in principle, the cohomology can be dened w.r.t.
the exterior derivative d(d2 = 0) and/or w.r.t.
the dual extrerior derivative (2 = 0)
where  =   d is the hodge dual of d. the operation of d on any arbitrary form
increases the degree of the form by one whereas the operation of  reduces it by one. in the
cohomological description of brst formalism, the conserved and nilpotent brst charge
(which generates a nilpotent quantum gauge symmetry) is identied with the exterior
derivative d in any arbitrary dimensions of spacetime. it would be, therefore, an interesting
endeavour to obtain the analogues of  and the laplacian  = (d + )2 = d + d in the
language of the nilpotent (for ), local, covariant and continuous symmetry properties of
a given lagrangian density. some attempts [15] have been made towards this goal in four
dimensions of spacetime but the symmetry transformations turn out to be nonlocal and
noncovariant. in the covariant formulation, the symmetry transformations turn out to be
even non-nilpotent and they become nilpotent only under certain specic restrictions [16].
the central theme of the present paper is to express the hodge decomposition theo-
rem in terms of the local and conserved charges corresponding to the analogues of d, 
and  of dierential geometry and establish a connection with the topological nature of
the two (1 + 1) dimensional non-abelian gauge theory having no interaction with matter
elds. we generalise our works for the free abelian u(1) gauge theory in two dimensions

3

(2d) [17,18] and show that the laplacian operator for the free non-abelain gauge theory
(without any interaction with matter elds) too, goes to zero when equations of motion
are exploited. this happens due to the fact that both the physical degrees of freedom of
the non-abelian gauge boson are gauged away by the presence of the nilpotent brst- and
co(dual)- brst symmetries in the theory. thus, theory becomes topological in nature (see,
e.g., ref. [11]). mathematically, the lagrangian density of the theory can be expressed as
the sum of brst- and co-brst invariant parts and, therefore, it bears an outlook similar
to the witten type theories [10]. the topological nature of this theory is conrmed by
the existence of two sets of topological invariants on the 2d compact manifold. in sec.
2, we set up the notations and give a concise description of the brst formalism for the
free d-dimensional non-abelian gauge theory. this is followed by the derivation of the
(anti)dual brst symmetries and corresponding charges in sec. 3. in sec. 4, we obtain
the symmetries that are generated by the analogue of the laplacian(casimir) operator and
derive the full brst algebra. sec. 5 is devoted to the discussion of hodge decomposition
theorem and the derivation of the topological invariants. finally, we make some concluding
remarks and point out some directions that can be pursued in the future.

2 preliminary: brst symmetries

let us begin with the brst invariant lagrangian density (lb) for the d-dimensional free
non-abelian gauge theory (having no interaction with matter elds) in the feynman gauge

lb =  1

 + ba(  a)a + 1

2 baba  i c adc a,

(2.1)

4 f af a
 + gf abcab

ac

   aa

 = aa

where f a
 is the eld strength tensor obtained from the
, ba is the group valued auxiliary eld, ( c a)c a are
group valued gauge connection aa
the (anti)ghost elds (( c a)2 = (c a)2 = 0) and the covariant derivative is dened as:
dc a = c a + gf abcab
c c, the d-dimensional at minkowski spacetime indices are
, ..... = 0, 1, 2, ...d  1, the group indices a, b, c, .... = 1, 2, 3, ... correspond to the compact
lie gauge group, g is the coupling constant and structure constants f abc are chosen to
be totally antisymmetric in a, b, c (see, e.g., [19]). the above lagrangian density respects
(blb = [badc a]) o-shell nilpotent (2

b = 0) brst symmetry transformations
2 f abcc bc c,

bba = 0,
b(  a)a = dc a,

bc a =  g
b c a = +iba,

(2.2)

where  is an anticommuting (c a = c a,  c a =  c a) spacetime independent transfor-
mation parameter. the on-shell (dc a = 0) nilpotent (2
b = 0) brst transformations
b c a = i(  a)a,
b(dc a) = 0,

bc a =  g

b(  a)a =  dc a,

 c c,

(2.3)

2 f abcc bc c,

can be derived from (2.2) by using the equation of motion ba = (  a)a and they leave
the following lagrangian density:

lb =  1

4 f af a

  1

2(  a)a(  a)a  i c ad c a,

(2.4)

quasi-invariant because blb = [( a)adc a]. these symmetries lead to the following
expression for the conserved and nilpotent brst charge (q(b,b)) (see, e.g., [3-5]):

4

q(b,b) = z dd1x [ bad0c a  bac a + 1

2 igf abc

c a c b c c ],

 z dd1x [ 0(  a)ac a  (  a)ad0c a + 1

2 igf abc

c a c b c c ].

(2.5)

the continuous global symmetry invariance of the total action under the transformations:
c a  ec a, c a  e c a, aa
, ba  ba, (where  is a global parameter), leads to
the derivation of the conserved ghost charge (qg)

  aa

qg = iz d(d1)x [ c a

c a + c a d0c a ].

(2.6)

the derivation of the anti-brst charge in non-abelian gauge theory is more involved. in
fact, one introduces another auxiliary eld ba in (2.1) for this purpose:

l b =  1

4 f af a

 + ba(  a)a + 1

2 (baba + ba ba)  i c adc a,

l b =  1

4 f af a

  ba(  a)a + 1

2(baba + ba ba)  id c ac a,

where the auxiliary elds are restricted to satisfy [20]

ba + ba = ig f abc c b c c.

(2.7a)

(2.7b)

(2.8)

under the brst transformations, it is interesting to note that ba transforms as: b ba =
gf abc bbc c. the following o-shell nilpotent (2
ab = 0) anti-brst (ab) transformations

abaa
abf a

 = d c a,
 = gf abcf b


c c,

ab c a =  g
abc a = +i ba,

2 f abc c b c c,

ab ba = 0,
abba = gf abcbb c c,

(2.9)

leave the lagrangian density (2.7b) quasi-invariant (abl b = [ bad c a]). the above
transformations (2.9) are generated by the nilpotent and conserved anti-brst charge

qab = z dd1x [

ba c a  bad0 c a  1

2 igf abc c a c b c c ].

(2.10)

together, the above three conserved charges satisfy:

{qb, qb} = {qab, qab} = 0,
{qb, qab} = qbqab + qabqb = 0,
i[qg, qb] = +qb,

i[qg, qab] = qab,

(2.11)

where the basic canonical (anti)commutators for the brst invariant lagrangian densities
have been exploited.
it can be seen that the specic combinations of transformations:
(bab + abb) acting on any eld generate no transformation at all (as {qb, qab} = 0).
in particular, it can be checked that {b, ab}aa
 = 0 is obeyed if and only if the restriction

5

(2.8) is satiseld. for the non-abelian compact lie algebra we have considered, the anti-
commutator of the brst- and anti-brst charges is zero . thus, the anti-brst charge
(qab) is not the analogue of the dual exterior derivative ().

3 dual brst symmetries

we consider here a two (1 + 1) dimensional non-abelian gauge theory and discuss dual
brst- and anti-dual brst symmetries. the lagrangian density (2.4) in 2d 

lb = 1

(3.1)
remains quasi-invariant (dlb = [ea c a]) under the following on-shell (d c a = 0)
nilpotent (2

d = 0) symmetry transformations

2 (  a)a(  a)a  i c adc a,

2 eaea  1

 =   c a,

daa
d(  a)a = 0,

d c a = 0,

dea = d c a,

dc a = iea,

d(d c a) = 0,
 = (d  d) c a.

df a

(3.2)

we christen this symmetry as the dual brst symmetry by taking analogy with the abelian
gauge theory where, like the above transformations, it is the gauge-xing term (  a)a that
remains invariant [17,18]. at this stage, it is essential to pin-point some of the dierences
and similarities between the brst- and dual brst symmetries in abelian u(1) gauge
theory and the same in the context of non-abelian gauge theory. in the abelian theory,
the gauge-xing term a = (  a) with  = d is the hodge dual of the two-form
f = da which is the electric eld e in 2d. this is not the case, however, for the non-
abelian gauge theory because the eld strength tensor f a
 contains a self-interacting term
gf abcab
 which is not present in the two-form f = da of the abelian gauge theory.
under the brst transformations in the abelian gauge theory, it is the two-form f = d a
that remains invariant (bf = 0) but for the non-abelian gauge theory the eld strength
tensor transforms: bf a
),
however, that remains invariant in both kinds of gauge theories. similarly, the dual brst
symmetry corresponds to a symmetry in which the gauge-xing term remains invariant.
the analogue of the lagrangian density (2.1) can be written for the two-dimensional case
by introducing one more auxiliary eld ba as:

c c. it is the total kinetic energy term ( 1

this lagrangian density respects the o-shell nilpotent (2
as well as the o-shell nilpotent (2
above lagrangian density, are juxtaposed as

b = 0) brst symmetry b. these symmetries, for the

 in a recent work [21], it has been pointed out that the cohomologically higher order brst- and anti-
brst operators do not anticommute and their anticommutator leads to the denition of a cohomologically
higher order laplacian operator.

(3.4)

under the above dual brst symmetry, the lagrangian density transforms as: dlb =
(ba c a). the on-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations (3.2) lead to the noether
d = [f a + (  a)a] c a which ultimately leads to the dual
conserved current j 
brst charge qd = r dx[ea c a  (  a)a1 c a]. now using the partial integration and the
equation of motion d0ea + 1(  a)a + igf abcc b1 c c = 0, this charge can be expressed as:

q(d,d) = z dx[ ea c
 z dx[ ba c

a

a

 d0ea c a  igf abc c a1 c bc c ],
 d0ba c a  igf abc c a1 c bc c ],

(3.5)

where the latter expression (for qd) has been obtained due to the validity of the equation
of motion ea = ba. it can be checked that under the following o-shell nilpotent (2
ad = 0)
anti-dual brst (ad) transformations

 =   c a,

adaa
ad(  a)a = 0,

adba = 0,

ad ba = 0,

the analogue of the lagrangian density (2.7b) in 2d:

l b = baea  1

2baba  ba(  a)a + 1

2(baba + ba ba)  id c ac a,

(3.6)

(3.7)

remains quasi-invariant because adl b = [bac a]. using the noether theorem, we
ad = f a c a + c a ba which leads to the
obtain the conserved current as: j 
anti-dual brst charge qad = r dx [ ba c a  ba1c a ]. using the partial integration and
exploiting the equations of motion : 1 ba = igf abc c b1c c  d0ba, we obtain

qad = z dx[ ba c a  d0bac a + igf abcc a1c b c c ].

(3.8)

it is straightforward to check that the above nilpotent and conserved charges qr(r =
b, ab, d, ad) are the generators of the transformations (2.2), (2.9), (3.4) and (3.6) because
these transformations can be concisely expressed as r = i[, qr] where (+) stands
for the (anti)commutator corresponding to the generic eld  being (fermionic)bosonic.

4 symmetries generated by the casimir operator

it is evident that the conserved and nilpotent charges qb and qd are the fermionic symme-
try generators corresponding to the transformations b and d for the lagrangian density
lb (cf. (3.3)). their anticommutator w = {qb, qd} will also generate a bosonic symme-
try transformation w = {b, d}. the following transformations

7

w c a = 0,

w ba = 0,
 = [ dba +   ba  igf abc c bc c ],

w c a = 0,
w aa
w ea = [ dba + ddba  igf abcd( c bc c) ],
w (  a)a = [ dba + igf abc  c b c c ],

w ba = 0,

(4.1)

(with bosonic transformation parameters  = i) are indeed the symmetry transforma-
tions because the lagrangian density lb transforms to a total derivative as:

w lb = [badba  baba + igf abc(ba c b +   c abb)c c].

(4.2)

in the expression for the bosonic transformation parameter  = i, the fermionic pa-
rameters  and  correspond to the transformations generated by qb and qd.
it will
be noticed that, out of three basic elds, the ghost- and antighost elds do not trans-
form under w and the gauge boson eld aa
 transforms to its own equation of motion:
dba +  ba  igf abc c bc c(= 0). the generator of the above transformations (4.1)
is a conserved charge w given by the following expression:

w = r dx [ ba ba  bad0ba  igf abc(ba c b  1 c abb)c c ].

(4.4)

since in the brst formalism, there are two more conserved and nilpotent charges qab and
qad, the anticommutator of these two can also dene operator w . concentrating on the
lagrangian density (3.7), we can check that the anticommutator {ab, ad} leads to the
following bosonic transformation w (with bosonic transformation parameter  = i)

w c a = 0,

 =  [ dba +  ba  igf abc  c b c c ],

w c a = 0,
w aa
w ea =  [ d ba  ddba  igf abcd(c b c c) ],
w (  a)a =  [ dba + igf abc c bc c ],

w ba = 0,

w ba = 0,

w ba = 0,

(4.5)

where  and  are the anticommuting transformation parameters corresponding to ab and
ad respectively. it is straightforward to check that the lagrangian density (3.7) undergoes
the following change under the transformations (4.5)

w l b =   [ badba  ba ba + igf abc(bac b + ba c b) c c ],

(4.6)

where use has been made of the identity

igf abcbad(c b c c)  igf abcc adbb c c = [igf abcbac b c c].

the generator of the symmetry transformations (4.5) is

w = r dx [ ba ba  bad0ba + igf abc(ba c b  ba1c b) c c ].

(4.7)

8

both the expressions for the conserved charge w are equivalent because they dier by a
total space derivative when equations of motion for the lagrangian densities are used.

there are other simpler ways to obtain the expression for the analogue of the laplacian
operator w . for instance, the symmetries (2.2), (2.9), (3.4) and (3.6) alone can be exploited
for the derivation of w . since qr (r = b, ab, d, ad) are the generators of all these
transformations, it can be seen that the following transformations

bqd = i {qd, qb} = iw  dqb,
abqad = i {qad, qab} = iw  adqab,

(4.8)

also lead to the derivation of w . furthermore, these expressions for w can also be ob-
tained from the anticommutators {qb, qd} or {qad, qab} by directly exploiting the basic
canonical (anti)commutators for (3.3) and (3.7) which are juxtaposed as

0(x, t), bb(y, t)] = iab(x  y),
1(x, t), bb(y, t)] = iab(x  y),
c b(y, t)} = ab(x  y),

[aa
[aa
{c a(x, t),
{ c a(x, t), d0c b(y, t)} = ab(x  y),

0(x, t), bb(y, t)] = iab(x  y),
[aa
[aa
1(x, t), bb(y, t)] = i ab (x  y),
{c a(x, t), d0 c b(y, t)} = ab(x  y),
{ c a(x, t), c b(y, t)} = ab(x  y),

(4.9)
and all the rest of the (anti)commutators turn out to be zero. the above canonical
(anti)commutators lead to the derivation of the following extended brst algebra

b = q2

d = q2

ab = q2

[w, qk] = 0, k = b, d, ab, ad, g,
q2
ad = 0,
{qb, qd} = {qab, qad} = w,
i[qg, qb] = +qb,
i[qg, qd] = qd,

i[qg, qab] = qab,
i[qg, qad] = +qad,

(4.10)

which is constituted by six conserved charges corresponding to six symmetries present in
the theory and all the rest of the (anti)commutators turn out to be zero. it is clear now
that the operator w is the analogue of the laplacian operator and is the casimir operator
for the whole algebra. it can be also seen that the ghost number for qb and qad is +1
and that of qab and qd is 1. now given a state | > in the quantum hilbert space with
ghost number n ( i.e., iqg| >= n| >), it is straightforward to check that:

iqg qb| > = (n + 1) qb| >,
iqg qd| > = (n  1) qd| >,
iqg w | > = n w | > .

(4.11)

the above equation shows that the ghost number of the brst exact state is one higher
(and that of the co-brst exact state is one lower) than the original state. this property
is similar to the operation of an exterior derivative (and a dual exterior derivative) on a
given dierential form. thus, the geometrical quantities d, ,  nd their identications in
the language of symmetry properties that are generated by qb, qd and w .

9

5 hodge decomposition theorem and topological invariants

a close look at the extended brst algebra (4.10) and the considerations of the ghost
numbers for the brst- and co-brst exact states and harmonic state (cf. (4.11)) allows
one to implement the hodge decomposition theorem in its full glory on any arbitrary state
of the quantum hilbert space (see, e.g., [4], [5], [13])

| >n= | >n + qb|  >n1 + qd | >n+1 .

(5.1)

the above equation implies that any arbitrary state | >n with ghost number n can be
decomposed into a harmonic state | >n (w | >n= 0, qb| >n= 0, qd| >n= 0), a brst
exact state qb| >n1 and a dual-brst exact state qd| >n+1. in fact, this equation
is the analogue of the mathematical statement on a compact manifold that any arbitrary
p-form fp can be written as the sum of a harmonic form p (p = 0, dp = 0, p = 0),
an exact form dgp1 and a co-exact form hp+1 due to the hodge decomposition theorem:

fp = p + dgp1 + hp+1.

thus, the ghost number of a state in the quantum hilbert space plays the same role as
the degree of a dierential form dened on a compact manifold. it will be noticed that the
brst cohomology can be dened either w.r.t. qb or qd or w.r.t. both. to rene the
brst cohomology, however, we have to choose a representative state from the total states
of (5.1) as a physical state. the harmonic states | > are very special for a given physical
theory because they are nite in number (see, e.g., [12]). let us dene our physical state
as the harmonic state (i.e., |phys >= | >). by denition, such a state would satisfy

w |phys >= 0,

qb |phys >= 0,

qd |phys >= 0.

(5.2)

in our earlier work on u(1) gauge theory [17,18], it has been shown that both the physical
degrees of a single photon state in 2d can be gauged away by the subsidiary conditions:
qb|phys >= 0, qd|phys >= 0 alone. thus, the operation of w on this physical photon
state becomes superuous. in fact, the laplacian operator goes to zero when the equations
of motion are exploited and the theory becomes topological in nature. in an analogous
manner, it turns out that both the expressions for w in (4.4) and (4.7) become

w = z dx d
 z dx d

dx [ 1
dx [ 1

2 baba  1

as x   ,

as a consequence of the equation of motion for the gauge boson eld from (3.3)

d0ba  1ba + igf abc 1 c b c c = 0,
d1ba  0ba + igf abc 0 c b c c = 0,

(5.3)

(5.4a)

and the same from lagrangian density (3.7)

d0ba + 1 ba  igf abc c b1c c = 0,
d1ba + 0ba  igf abc c b0c c = 0.

10

(5.4b)

it will be noticed that both the expressions for w in (5.3) are equivalent because ba1ba =
ba1 ba  1x where x = igf abc bac b c c + 1
2 g2f abcf amnc b c cc m c n. the vanishing of the
operator w in (5.3) is the reection of the fact that there are no physical degrees of freedom
left in the theory (as the brst and co-brst symmetries gauge away both the degrees of
freedom of gauge boson in 2d) and it becomes topological in nature [11]. this situation
should be contrasted with the interacting u(1) gauge theory where dirac fermions couple
to the gauge eld. as it turns out, the laplacian operator does not go to zero even on the
on-shell [22] because of the presence of the fermionic degrees of freedom in the theory.

the topological nature of the theory is conrmed by the presence of the topological
invariants on the 2d manifold. the two sets of these invariants w.r.t. both the conserved
and nilpotent charges qb and qd are (see, e.g., [10],[11],[23])

ik[ck] = i ck

vk,

jk[ck] = i ck

wk,

k = 0, 1, 2

(5.5)

where ck are the k-dimensional homology cycles and the k-forms vk and wk are

v0 = ba c a  ig
v1 = [baaa
v2 = i[aa

w0 = ba c a,
w1 = [ c ac a  i baaa

] dx,

d c a  c adaa

2 (  a)a]dx  dx.
(5.6)
it can be seen that v0 and w0 are brst and co-brst invariant respectively and v2 and
w2 are closed and co-closed respectively. these invariants for (k = 1, 2) obey [23], [10]

where d and  are the exterior and dual-exterior derivatives on the 2d compact manifold.
unlike the u(1) gauge theory [18] here there are no specic transformations that can relate
ik and jk. using the on-shell nilpotent transformations (2.3) and (3.2), it is interesting to
verify that, modulo some total derivatives, the lagrangian density (3.1) can be written as
the sum of brst- and co-brst invariant parts:

lb = 1

2 d [ ieac a ]  1

2 b [ i(  a)a c a ].

(5.8)

using the fact that conserved and nilpotent charges qr (r = b, d) are the generator of trans-
formations r = i[, qr], where (+) stands for the (anti)commutator corresponding
to the generic eld  being (fermionic)bosonic, it can be seen that the lagrangian density
2 (  a)a c a.
(5.8) can be recast as: lb = {qd, s1} + {qb, s2} for s1 = 1
this demonstrates that the topological theory under consideration is similar in outlook

2 eac a and s2 =  1

as the witten type theories [10]. there is a bit of dierence, however. this is because
of the fact that there are two conserved and nilpotent charges in our discussion whereas
there exists only one conserved and nilpotent brst charge in ref. [10]. it is straightfor-
ward to check that the partition functions and expectation values of the brst invariants,
co-brst invariants and the topological invariants are metric independent . the main
argument to show this fact in the framework of brst cohomology is the requirement that
qb|phys >= 0, qd|phys >= 0 (see, e.g., ref. [11]) and the metric independence of the path
integral measure (see, e.g., ref. [23]).

6 conclusions

we have shown that the nilpotent symmetry transformations under which the gauge-xing
term remains invariant (d[(  a)a(  a)a] = 0) is the dual brst symmetry in contrast
to the usual brst symmetry under which the total kinetic energy term remains invariant
(b[f af a
] = 0). the anticommutator of these two symmetries corresponds to a sym-
metry (generated by the laplacian(casimir) operator) under which the ghost elds do not
transform (w c a = w c a = 0) and the gauge connection transforms to its own equation of
motion. thus, this symmetry becomes trivial on the on-shell. this triviality is connected
with the topological nature of the 2d free non-abelian gauge theory as the brst- and
co-brst symmetries are good enough to gauge away both the degrees of freedom of the
gauge boson. in fact, the laplacian operator goes to zero when the equations of motion
are exploited. the on-shell expression of the laplacian operator encompasses the degrees
of freedom left in the theory. in the case of u(1) gauge eld coupled to the dirac fermion,
it has been shown that the laplacian operator does not go to zero even on the on-shell and
its expression contains only the fermionic degrees of freedom [22]. furthermore, it has been
demonstrated that the co-brst transformation on the u(1) gauge eld corresponds to
the quantum chiral transformation on the dirac fermions in 2d. this symmetry, therefore,
might shed light on the abj anomaly in 2d and might provide clue to the consistency
of the anomalous gauge theory in 2d (see, e.g., [24,25]). it will be interesting to study
the brst cohomolgy when non-abelian gauge eld is coupled to the matter elds and
generalise these understandings to the case of gauge theories in physical four dimensions.

it will be noticed that we have taken here the at minkowski metric. however, our arguments and
discussions are valid for any nontrivial metric. the metric independence of the path integral measure for
the topological eld theories has been shown in ref. [23].
