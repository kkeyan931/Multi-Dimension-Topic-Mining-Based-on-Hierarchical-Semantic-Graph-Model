abstract

we consider the ads5 solution deformed by a non-constant dilaton interpo-
lating between the standard ads (uv region) and at boundary background
(ir region). we show that this dilatonic solution can be generalized to the
case of a non-at boundaries provided that the metric of the boundaries
satises the vacuum einstein eld equations.

as an example, we describe the case when the four-dimensional bound-

aries represent the kerr space-time.

the recently discovered recently remarkable ads/cft correspondence
between higher-dimensional classical supergravity and quantum gauge the-
ory on the boundary (bulk/boundary correspondence) [1] gives a new insight
to the understanding of strongly coupled gauge theories. in particular, the
ads5s5 vacua of type-iib supergravity correspond to the four-dimensional
super yang mills theory on the boundary. this stimulated attempts to get
the description of running gauge coupling of yang-mills theory and qcd-
connement in the frames of type-0 superstring theory [2, 3, 4]. in another
approach [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the attempts to reproduce similar qcd-eects were
based on the non-supersymmetric background solutions of type-iib string
theory which can be obtained due to the deformation of ads5  s5 vacuum
by a non-constant dilaton breaking the supersymmetry and conformal sym-
metry. the exact solution of a such sort was rst given in [10] and we shall
follow the notations of this work. starting with ten-dimensional dilatonic
gravity and the solution with topology of ads5  s5, one can integrate out
ve coordinates of the sphere s5 and obtain [10, 9] eective action for ads5
background

assuming that solutions for g and  depend only on coordinate y  x5, the

where ij is the metric of minkowski background. as it was shown in [10, 9],
the solution of these equations can be given in ve dimensions by functions

where 2 =  is positive. the main peculiarity of this solution is the
appearance of two boundaries corresponding to dierent limiting values of
the dilaton. this solution interpolates between conformal ads background
(weak coupling regime, y  ) and at space at singular value of dilaton
  6
the aim of this note is to attract attention to the possibility of the gener-
alization of this solution for non-at four-dimensional boundaries. we shall
show that any metric of the form

2 ln y (strong coupling regime, y  0).

ds2 = gdxdx = f (y)dy2 + g(y)gikdxidxk

(7)

represents the solution of dilatonic gravity equations (2) and (3) provided
that the boundary metric gik satises the vacuum einstein equations. this
result is also valid for a d-dimensional boundary of adsd+1. as an example
we consider in more details d=4 case when the four-dimensional boundary
represents the kerr geometry.

let us consider d+1-dimensional metric (7) where gik is a d-dimensional
boundary metric, , ... = 0, 1, ...d, and i, k, ... = 0, 1...d  1. in the matrix
notations we have

g =   g(y)gik 0

f ! ,

0

while the contravariant form of this metric is given by

g =   g(y)1gik

0

f 1 ! ,

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

where gik is the contravariant form of the corresponding d-dimensional met-
ric. the expressions for the connection coecients 
 are given in appendix.
for the ricci curvature tensor we have

2g )2 + f g
4f g ,

rdd
rid
rik = rik + gik[ f g

2g + ( g
= 0,
4f 2  g

2f + (2  d) (g)2
4f g ].

the important point is that rik represents ricci curvature of d-dimensional
boundary with the metric gik and the connections l
ik. similarly, the scalar
curvature is

r = g1 r +

d
4f

[2

finally, the expressions for the einstein tensor are given by g = r

2gmur and are as follows:

= d(d1)
gdd

gid

gik = gik + gik[ (d1)(d4)(g )2

].

when the d-dimensional metric gik satises the vacuum einstein eld equa-
tions gik = 0, the components gik drop out of the equations (2) and (3).
as a result we come exactly to dierential equations for functions f and g
given in the paper [9] and to the expressions (5) and (6). therefore, in the
solutions (4), (5) and (6) the d-boundary metric ik can be replaced by any
metric gik satisfying the vacuum einstein equations.

as an example let us now consider the partial case d = 4 and the kerr

boundary metric gik in the kerr-schild form

gik = ik + 2hkikk,

where h is the harmonic scalar function

h = mr/(r2 + a2 cos2 ),

(17)

(18)

and m is the mass parameter. this is an important solution of the vacuum
einstein equations describing the eld of rotating black holes and modelling
the gravitational eld of spinning particle [11, 12]. besides, this form allows
one to get a simple comparison with the minkowskian case.

the vector eld ki(x) is tangent to the principal null congruence and it

is determined by the 1-form

are the cartesian null coordinates, and y (x) = ei tan 
2 is the projective
angular coordinate. 2 the eld ki is null in respect to minkowski metric,
kikkik = 0, as well as regarding the metric gik

kikkgik = 0.

(21)

one can build the ve dimensional eld k = (ki, 0) which will obviously be
the null eld with respect to the full ve-dimensional metric as well

kkg = 0.

therefore, the ve-dimensional kerr-ads metric takes the form

ds2 = f (y)dy2 + g(y)[ik + 2hkikk]dxidxk,

(22)

(23)

where functions f (y), g(y) and h are given by (6), (5) and (18), and vector
eld ki is determined by expressions (19) and (20).

in the region of parameters corresponding to spinning particles the black
hole horizons disappear and a region of the rotating disk-like source is
opened. the structure of this source should possess some properties of ocd-
connement and represents an old problem. the predicted exotic properties
of the matter of this source [12] do not allow to construct them in four di-
mensions from a known sort of classical matter. the conjectured ads/cft
correspondence gives a new approach to this problem and stimulates con-
sideration of new models, in particular, of a bag-like models resembling the
cosmic bubble models. in this case the bag-like source based on the super-
symmetric domain wall models [13] can contain the ads-region of a false
vacuum inside the bag separated from the true vacuum of the outer region
by a thin domain wall. as a eld model, the supersymmetric version of
u(1) u(1) witten model [14] seems the most appropriate, since it provides
the long range electromagnetic eld out of core. a hypothetical mechanism
of the formation of the bag-like kerr source can be connected with a phase
transition governed by the value of dilaton near the core.

the ads-bh solution of another sort was considered in [15].

i am thankful to sergei odintsov for paying my attention to this area and

for useful discussions.

2it can be also expressed as y = (z  ia r)/(x iy), where r = r + ia cos  is complex

radial distance.
