abstract

this report is an extension of previous one hep-th/9812189. several quantum mechanical wave equations
for p-branes are proposed. the most relevant p-brane quantum mechanical wave equations determine the
quantum dynamics involving the creation/destruction of p-dimensional loops of topology sp, moving in a d
dimensional spacetime background, in the quantum state . to implement full covariance we are forced to
enlarge the ordinary relativity principle to a new relativity principle, suggested earlier by the author based
on the construction of c-space, and also by pezagglias polydimensional relativity, where all dimensions
and signatures of spacetime should be included on the same footing.

i. introduction

quantization of p-branes is a notoriously dicult unsolved problem. we present here an extension of
previous work [19] where several dierent quantum mechanical wave equations associated with the quantum
dynamics of p-branes based on two views are furnished : (i) that p-branes can be seen as gauge theories of
volume preserving dieomorhisms and (ii) that closed p-branes of topology sp may be represented by p-dim
loops moving in spacetime.

one of these wave equations represents the quantum eld theory dynamics of p-branes living in a d
dimensional spacetime with a given world volume measure congurations ( jacobians) in a quantum state
. the other wave equations determine the quantum dynamics involving the creation/destruction of p-
dimensional loops of topology sp in a d dimensional spacetime background , in the quantum state .
a square root procedure a la dirac yields wave equations of rst order. the last wave equation based
on the kanatchikov-navarro de donder-weyl quantization program is a step towards a nite dimensional
formulation of the eld theory of p-branes.

comparisons with previous loop equations are made [5] . to implement full covariance, we are forced
to enlarge the ordinary relativity principle to a new relativity principle , suggested earlier by the author
[8] based on the construction of c-space, and also by pezagglias polydimensional relativity [9] , where all
dimensions and signatures of spacetime should be included on the same footing.

in section 2.1 we discuss the p-loop wave equations and in 2.2 the duality between p-branes and
composite antisymmetric tensor field theories is discussed. in 3.1 we compare other loop wave equations
and discuss the need for a new relativity principle. some preliminary results on the new relativistic
tranformations in c-space are given in 3.2 .
in 4.1 the dirac equations is presented and in 4.2 the
kanatchikov-navarro de donder-weyl quantization program towards a nite dimensional formulation of the
eld theory of p-branes is nally given.

2. p-brane wave equations suggest a new relativity principle

2.1 wave equations based on antisymmetric tensor field theories

a local antisymmetric tensor gauge eld theory reformulation of extended objects was given by [1,2]
which later paved the way for the author to show that p-branes could be seen as composite antisymmetric
tensor gauge eld theories of the volume-preserving dieomorphisms group [3,4] associated with the target
space of the primitive scalar eld constituents . the action [1,2] was dened :

s = g2z ddxs

(p + 1)!

(w12....p+1)2 +

1

(p + 1)!

w 12....p+11 b2....p+1.

(2.1)

b2....p+1 was a lagrange multipier enforcing the transversality condition on the antisymmetric current
w 12....p+1. the eld equations associated with the w and b elds admit p-brane solutions when the
antisymmetric tensor current w evaluated on any spacetime point x, is related to the p + 1-vector tangent
to the worlvolume of the p-brane :

w12....p+1(x) = z dp+1d(x  x()) ~x12....p+1().

with the p + 1-vector tangent to the p branes worldvolume :

~x12....p+1() = 12....p+1

1 x1......p+1 xp+1 =

(x1, x2 , .....xp+1)
(1, 2, ......, p+1)

.

(2.2)

(2.3)

plugging the solution (2.2, 2.3) into the original action (2.1) yields the p-brane dirac-nambu-goto action
after using the property of the delta function integration :

s = (g2)z dp+1s

1

(p + 1)!

( ~x12....p+1)2. tp = g2.

(2.4)

the p-brane tension is expressed in terms of the coupling constant g with the addition of an extra parameter
 to accomodate dimensions : tp = g2. the solution (2.2) is dened up to a scaling parameter given by .
the polymomenta 12....p+1 variables conjugate to the integrated p + 1-tangent hyperplanes to the world
volume of the p-brane are dened as :

12....p+1 

s

 ~x 12....p+1

= tp

(2.5a)

~x12....p+1

(p+1)! ( ~x12....p+1)2

q 1

we nd it useful to remark the following technical subtlety, contary to the literature , that the polymomenta
are strictly speaking not the conjugate variables to the jacobians ~x12....p+1 given by eq-(2-3) but to the
integrals of these jacobians. this parallels the fact that p is the conjugate variable to the coordinate q and
not to the velocity dq
dt in ordinary point particle mechanics. this technical issue will become clear below
when we write down the wave functional equations associated with the quantum dynamics of p-dim loops of
spherical topolgy, sp, where each p-dim loop is seen as the only boundary of an open p + 1-dim hypersurface.

the p-brane extension of the hamilton-jacobi equation is [1,2] :

1

(p + 1)!



(12....p+1)2 + t 2

p =

(p + 1)!

[

(s1(x), s2(x), ..., sp+1)

]2 + t 2

p = 0.

(2.5b)

where s1(x), s2(x), ...sp+1(x) are the clebsch potentials [1,2]. the polymomentum 12....p+1, when ex-
tended from the p-branes world tube to all of spacetime, is the so-called slope or geodesic eld of the
p-brane. the pullback from spacetime to the p-branes world tube of the slope/geodesic eld is the p-branes
volume-momentum, a1
1 (a) , conjugate to the p-branes conguration coordinate x (a), a = 1, 2, ...p + 1
:

12....p+1a1a2....ap+1

a2 x 2(a)a3 x 3(a).........ap+1 x p+1(a)  a1

1 (a).

(2.6)

the reformulation of p-branes in terms of antisymmetric tensor elds was based on the old vor-
tex/hydrodynamics ideas of nielsen and olesen. p-branes are reinterpreted as higher dimensional vortices.
the vortex velocity (inside the uid) at any given point of the vortex matches the uids velocity at that given
point. the vortex velocity plays the role of the p + 1-vector tangent to the p-branes world tube whereas the
uids velocity plays the role of the slope/geodesic eld, 12....p+1 dened outside the p-brane. when the
slope/geodesic eld is restricted to have support on the p-branes world tube then it matches the p + 1-vector
tangent to the p-brane.

we propose our rst quantum mechanical wave functional equation for the closed p-brane, of topology

sp, a p-dim loop cp, based on the hamilton-jacobi equation to be of the following form :

2

1

2(cp)

(p + 1)!

12....p+1(cp)12....p+1(cp)

+ e 2

p  = 0.

(2.7a)

which is just the constraint implementation of the hamilton-jacobi on-shell condition (2.5) on (cp). the
explicit derivation of (2.7a) will be presented below. to make contact with the previous functional wave
equations in the literature it proves convenient to write (2-7a) in the form :

z dp(s) [

1

2

(p + 1)!

12....p+1(cp)12....p+1(cp)

+ e 2

p ](cp) = 0.

(2.7b)

the quantities in (2-7a) are function-valued objects whereas upon integration in (2-7b) they become ordinary
numbers. dp(s) is a p-dimensional reparametrization invariant measure on the boundary m = cp, a p-dim
loop of topology sp parametrized by (s1, s2, ....sp). .

if one adopts the view taken by the literature that the polymomentum is the conjugate to the jacobians

(2-3), generalized velocities, then the hamilton-jacobi equation reads :

z dp+1det h [

2

(p + 1)!

 ~x12....p+1() ~x 12....p+1()

+ e 2

p

m2(p+1) ]( ~x12....p+1) = 0.

(2.7c)

some important remarks are in order.

eq-(2-7c) is by construction only p + 1-dimensional volume-preserving dis invariant since the jacobians
(2-3) are volume-preserving dis invariant by denition. one could fully covariantized (2.7c) by adding
the judicious terms in the derivative operators. for the time being we shall not be concerned with this
covariantization program. however, (2-7b) is explicitly p-dim boundary reparametrization invariant. the
elds ,  are taken to be a lorentz scalars since the hamilton-jacobi equation and the wave equations (2.7)
must remain lorentz invariant. in the next section we will take the square root of (2.7) a la dirac to obtain
a rst order wave equation where the elds ,  are no longer scalars nor trivial spinors as it occurs for a
point particle. similar studies were undertaken by hosotani and collaborators [13-15 ]. the transformation
laws of the elds under lorentz transformations for the p-brane eld theory are highly nontrivial since they
involved the introduction of generalized dirac matrices.

we wish to emphasize that there are many dierences between this work and that of [13-15]. mainly
their wavefunctional is dened as [x ()]. these authors x the temporal reparametrizations by choos-
ing the gauge x0 =  ; they work at the end in a simplied minisuperspace approach where their wave
f unctionalequations are reduced yielding ordinary dierential equations of a multicomponent eld  de-
pending solely on a nite number of variables, instead of an innite number of components. these variables
are related to the locations and shapes of the p-branes : center of mass coordinates, length, volumes,.... and
total ( integrated ) mean curvatures of the p-brane. their bosonic string spectrum does not contain tachyons
in variance with the other quantization approaches. nevertheless, the simplied wave equations furnished by
hosotani et al [13-15] will be very useful to nd nontrivial solutions to the wave equations (2-7) other than
the standard plane wave types. it is also desirable to nd a relationship between our approach and theirs.
ep is the energy per unit volume of the p-brane or p-branes tension. we set our units to be such h = 1
and m in (2-7c) is a suitable parameter of mass needed to match dimensions . this is not an articial
introduction of an extra parameter, m, but it has a well dened physical meaning in the eguch-schild
quantization scheme of the string [5]. the usual nambu-goto-polyakov quantization is based on keeping the
string tension constant while taking the average over all worldsheet areas. the string tension is related to
the planck scale/regge slope  :

t2 = m2 =

1
2 .

(2.8)

whereas in the eguchi-schild quantization one starts from an action given by the squared of the strings
worldsheet area ( instead of the area) and invariant under area-preserving dis :

s =

1

2 z d2{x , x }p b{x, x}p b

3

(2.9)

the poisson brackets are taken w.r.t the 1, 2 variables. one quantizes by keeping f ixed the world sheet
area of the string histories and taking the average over all the variable string tension values; i.e the energy
per unit length of the string, e , is not kept constant. the nambu-goto quantization imposes the condition
: e = t2 = m2 which is not the case in the eguchi-schild quantization scheme.
p . for these reasons we shall set the ratio (ep/mp+1)2
to be equal to 2; i.e the eigenvalue of the functional derivative operator acting on . there is another
version of the schild action for strings and p-branes that is explicitly reparametrization invariant by means
of introducing an auxiliary eld . upon elimination of this eld via its equations of motion one recovers the
dirac-nambu-goto action. such action is of the area, volume squared form with a cosmological constant
terms added. for the time being we shall not be concerned with this particular action. the quantity :

therefore, m2(p+1) is not necessary equal to e 2

 = [ ~x 12....p+1(1, ...., p+1)].

(2.10)

is the wave f unctional associated to a p-brane with a given p + 1-vector tangent to the p-brane.

~x 12....p+1(a) are just the components of the jacobians (2-3) associated with the p + 1 world volume
of the p-brane as it sweeps spacetime ( a measure conguration) in the quantum state . we must emphasize
that this wavefunctional must not be interpreted as a probability amplitude. we are dealing with a truly
covariant eld theory of p-branes, which upon ( second) quantization, becomes a quantum eld theory of
p-branes and not a rst quantized one. we will discuss shortly the quantization of the eld theory of p-branes
associated with the equation (2-7).

 truly represents a eld which after second quantization will create/destroy a p-brane with a given
tangent hyperplane to the p + 1 world volume at each point ( with a given measure conguration at each
point ); i.e the p-branes history embedded in a d-dimensional target spacetime background in the quantum
state  has a given tangent plane at each point. eq-(2-7c) is linked to the fact that p-branes are seen here
as theories related to gauge theories of the volume-preserving dis group. the latter are not ordinary non-
abelian ym gauge theores that we are familiar with but composite antisymmetic tensor eld theories [3]. the
center of mass motion of the p-brane is factored out in these theories. for example, in the membrane case,
this gives the su (n = ) gauge theory instead of the u (n ) one. roughly speaking, the wave functional
equations (2-7c) do not govern the center of mass motion ( the location) , only the volume congurations (
shapes) of the p-brane.

we present now the derivation of (2-7a,2-7b). we concentrate for simplicity on closed p-branes, a p-
dimensional loop , of topology sp, whose history is a p + 1-dimensional world volume embedded in a target
spacetime of dimensions d. such loop history emerges initially from the vacuum that is represented by a
point : the p-loop starts intially as a point and evolves in time ( the proper world volume time traced out by
the p-dim loop in its motion through spacetime) to a given spatial conguration cp of topology sp. at any
given moment the p-loop can be seen as the only boundary of the p + 1 world volume hypersurface spanned
by the p-dim loop. based on this picture one has that an integration by parts yields :

12.....p+1 =zm

dp+1 ~x 12.....p+1 =zm

dpsx 1  dx 2  ....  dx p+1.

(2.11)

12....p+1 are the p+1-dimensional volume ( holographic) components enclosed by the boundary, cp = m
( a p-dimensional loop) of the hypersurface ( world volume) m . the coordinates of the boundary or p-loop,
x (~s), can be parametrized by the p components s = (s1, s2, ....sp) or also by the  variables subject to the
conditions dening the boundary : x ()|m = x (s1, s2, ....sp). such volume components 12.....p+1,
or plucker coordinates, are those obtained inequivalently as the projections ( holographic shadows) of the
p-loop onto the coordinate planes of the embedding space time. for the time being we shall not be concerned
with the plucker conditions which ensure us that we have a 1  1 correspondence between the p-loop and
the plucker coordinates [5] . neither we will be concerned at the moment with the dierent topologies
assigned to the hypersurface. if there is no boundary then the integral (2-11) is automatically zero. one
may envision this boundaryless case when the initial p-loop starts from a point and evolves to a point : a
vacuum to vacuum transition spanning a closed p + 1-hypersurface : a virtual p-brane history.

in the case of the string, p = 1, (2-11) becomes :

4

 [c1] =z dx   dx  =

1

2ic1

(x dx   x dx ).

(2.12)

which is nothing but stokes law.  [c1] are the so-called holographic ( or shadows) area components of
the loop c1 projected onto the coordinates planes of spacetime [5]. .

our view which diers from the literature is that the p + 1-volume components 12.....p+1 are the
true conjugate variables to the polymomenta of the closed p-brane 12.....p+1 since the former is given by
the integral of the latter :

z dp+1s 1

(p + 1)!|| ~x 12....p+1||2 12.....p+1 = tpzm

dp+1 ~x 12.....p+1 = tp12.....p+1.

(2.13)

where we have used for the integration measure the quantity :

z dp+1s 1

(p + 1)!|| ~x 12....p+1||2 =z dp+1det h.

(2.14)

this is the multi-vector ( multisymplectic) generalization of the canonical momentum of a point particle .
for example, in nonrelativistic mechanics one has the ordinary momentum ~p = m d ~x
dt . an integration of ~p
m
w.r.t the variable t yields the coordinate ~x which is the canonically conjugate variable to ~p. the velocity
is not the canonical conjugate to the momentum. for this simple reason we refrain from saying that the
jacobians (2-3) ( generalized velocities) are the canonically conjugates to the 12.....p+1.

the bracket is then dened on the p-dim boundary m :

{12.....p+1(s), 12.....p+1(s)}|m = 12.....p+1

12....p+1 p(s  s).

(2.15)

upon quantization one has  equal time  commutators of the polymomenta and volume operators. the
temporal variable in this picture is nothing but the invariant proper world volume interval spanned by the
evolution of the p-dim loop given across its motion through spacetime and is given by the dirac-nambu-goto
action (2-11). this is the higher dimensional extension of the eguchi area quantization of the schild string
[5]. the areas, volumes,....are interpreted as the evolution parameters. it in this respect that the bracket
operations are dened on the boundary; i.e on the p-dim loop cp. equal areal, volume,....time canonical
quantization implies sitting on the p-dim loop at any given instant.
it is warranted to nd a rigorous
multisymplectic geometric formulation of the brackets (2-15) and the whole hamilton-jacobi equations (2-7,
2-17).

the usual prescription :

12.....p+1  i



12....p+1(cp)

.

(h = 1)

renders the hamilton-hacobi equation as a constraint on (cp) :

1

2

(p + 1)!

12....p+1(cp)12....p+1(cp)

+ e 2

p  = 0.

(2.16)

(2.17a)

to make contact with the literature we shall again write (2-17a) in the integral form :

dp(s) [

icp

1

2

(p + 1)!

12....p+1(cp)12....p+1(cp)

+ e 2

p ] (cp) = 0.

(2.17b)

with dp(s) being a p-dimensional reparametrization invariant measure of the p-dim boundary. notice that
having started with the jacobian variables (2-3) that were invariant soley under volume-preserving dis,
eq-(2-17b) is however explicitly p-dimensional reparametrization invariant ; i.e invariant under (s1, s2, ....sp)

5

go to (s1, s2, ....). the lorentz scalar  = [12....p+1(cp)] is the classical eld functional of the p-dim
loop cp.

upon ( second ) quantization the  becomes an operator which creates ( destroys) the p-dim loops cp.
the functional derivatives appearing in (2-17) are p-loop functional derivatives that can be visualized as
attaching an innitesimal p-dim petal to the p-loop at a given point along the p-loop. a petal that encloses
an innitesimal volume whose holographic projections onto the coordinate embedding spacetime planes are
what one means by 12....p+1(cp).

if one adopts the conventional view of the literature one arrives at eq-(2-7c). since a given p-loop is
seen as the only boundary of the p + 1 world volume ( hypersurface) associated with the history of a closed
p-brane which began as a point ( loop shrinking to a point) and evolved to the spatial conguration cp
tracing out an open p + 1 world volume in a given time, one can associate to a given p-loop eld [] the
corresponding open-hypersurface eld  :

[12....p+1(cp)]  [ ~x 12....p+1()].

(2.18)

that allows to rewrite the initial hamilton-jacobi constraint equation on  also in terms of  like we did
in eq-(2-7c). the latter is the eld ( after second quantization) which creates ( destroys) a given p + 1-dim
hypersurface with cp as its only boundary and whose tangent plane ( measure density ) conguration at
any given point of the hypersurface is ~x 12....p+1().

a string representation of quantum loops has been given in [8] where the wavefunctional of a relativistic
loop was explicitly expressed in terms of string degrees of freedom starting from a covariant phase space
schild action path integral. the polyakov string partition function was furnished from rst principles and
something more was obtained : the eguchi wavefunctional, encoding the area dynamics of the boundary,
was also derived and, in addition, extra terms to regularize boundary ultraviolet divergences were included
as well in one single scoop. a phase space path integral process for p-branes, similar to the one employed
in [8] should render the specic relationship between [cp] and [ ~x 12....p+1()]. although this is a very
dicult problem.

2.2 branes/composite antisymmetric tensor field theories : a new duality principle

before ending this section we wish to bring an important connection between p-branes and nonabelian
antisymmetric tensor eld theories which are not of the yang-mills type.
in [3] we have shown that p-
branes can been seen as extended solutions to composite antisymmetric tensor gauge eld theories of the
volume preserving dis group. although the lagrangians were of the ym types, which precisely bear the
same resemblance as the schilds lagrangian associated with the group su () of area-preserving dis for
spacetime independent gauge eld congurations ( vacuum), these nonabelian theories are not yang-mills
theories. the lagrangians [3] were :

1
g2
p

[f12....p+1(a(x))]2.

(2.20)

with the composite eld strength dened in [4] :

f12....p+1((x)) = a1a2......ap+11 a1 (x)2 a2 (x)....p+1 ap+1(x).

(2.21)

the elds a(x) are a collection of a = 1, 2, ....p + 1 primitive scalars living in a spacetime of dimensionality
d = p + 1 + p + 1 and taking values in a target space of dimensionality p + 1. the dual primitive scalars
b(x) live in spacetime and take values in a target space of dimensionality p + 1. notice that this is the
dual picture to what we are familiar with in the description of p-branes. here we have maps from spacetime
into manifolds of less dimension : an immersion. we have shown that every strongly coupled composite
antisymmetric tensor eld theory of p+ 1-rank dened in d spacetime has a weakly coupled p brane solution
and vice versa. also we have t duality with a large/small volume duality in the space of solutions . s and
t dualities were interrelated to each other. the relevance of these composite theories is that we have a
formulation of p-branes where s, t dualities are already built in from the very start : at the lagrangian
level, there is no need to conjecture them.

6

there was another sort of duality [3,19] ] ( this duality has been recently discussed in the literature [20]
by baker and fairlie in terms of brane-wave duality based on early work on universal field equations [21])
that could be inferred under the exchange:

this duality (2.13) exchanges target manifold for base manifold. the composite eld strength is then replaced
by :

a x 1  1 a(x).

(2.22)

[f12....p+1(a(x))]2  [12....p+1

1 x 1 ......p+1x p+1]2.

(2.23)

ths last equation (2.23) has the similar form as the skyrmion-based dolan-tchakrian conformaly invariant
lagrangians [6] for the m-brane in the case that m + 1 = 2n = 2(p + 1). similar actions can also be
constructed for m + 1 = 2n + 1 but in such case conformal invariance was lost. a spinning membrane
action based on the dolan-tchrakian lagrangians was constructed in [7]. dolan-tchrakian have shown that
upon the algebraic elimination of the auxiliary world volume metrics gab, via their equations of motion, one
recovers the nambu-goto actions. the antisymmetrization w.r.t the indices of dolan-tchrakians action was
done as follows :

z d2ng11

g22

....gp+1p+1

[1 x 1......p+1]x p+1[1x1 ......p+1]xp+1.

(2.24)

the antisymmetrizations of indices [1, 2....p+1] and [1, 2....p+1] will render such lagrangians in the
similar form of eq-(2.23). one can either antisymmetrize w.r.t the world volume metric indices or w.r.t the
indices of the derivatives acting on the coordinates x . notice, that the latter skyrmion-based actions are
not of the p + 1-volume squared form ( like the schild action).the lagrangian of (2.24) is integrated w.r.t
the 2(p + 1)-dim world volume of the m-brane, m + 1 = 2n = 2(p + 1), and not w.r.t the p + 1-dim world
volume of the schild actions.

such actions (2-21, 2-23,2-24) are very suitable to quantize using the zariski deformation quantization
program initiated by flato et al [16] which has found recent interesting in the context of m (atrix) theory and
deformation of nambu-poisson mechanics [17]. recently, we were able to show that certain p-branes actions
could be derived from a moyal deformation quantization of tchakrians generalized yang mills theories
[18].

3. towards a new relativity principle

3.1 . the loop space wavefunctional of a p-brane : other approaches

a noncovariant schroedinger-like loop wave equation for the bosonic closed string based on the eguchi
areal time quantization scheme of the schild action ( which is only area-preserving dis invariant) was given
by [5] :

(3.1)

the stationary string wave functional, [ (c)] , in this nonrelativistic schroedinger-like loop wave equation
represents the quantum probablity amplitude to nd a given closed loop c, with spatial area-elements or
holographic shadows  (c) onto a spacetime background, as the only boundary of a two-surface of internal
area a in a given quantum state . e is the energy per unit length or the string tension and m ( discussed
earlier) is the mass parameter related to the string regge slope which is not necessary equal to the variable
string tension : e.
 represents dx/ds. the
operator acting on the  lies inside the integral w.r.t the parameter s. this results from the fact that one
started from a hamiltonian density instead of an integrated quantity. the factor 1

procedure that results from performing the loop derivative by attaching an innitesimal petal, at any given
point along the loop, and then averaging over all points along the loop. the wave equation is explicitly
s-reparametrization invariant despite the fact that the schild action is only area-preserving dis invariant. .
to be able to compare (3.1) with the previous equations (2-7, 2-17) it is convenient to multiply (3-1)

quantization the string tension is kept f ixed and identied with the m2 parameter : e = t = m2 = 1

. hence one has an exact result with (2-7b. 2-17b) since then the second term inside the integral becomes
e 2. in this special case one recovers the marshall-ramond wave equation obtained long ago [26]. similar
x(s) derivatives as discussed
results were obtained by hosotani [13]. one could reexpress (3.2 ) in terms of
by [5,13 ] by using the chain rule :

where we have explicitly written (3-3 ) in terms of the s-reparametrization invariant expressions :

(3.4)

to sum up, we have shown how the covariant hamilton-jacobi equation for closed p-branes ( p-loops)
based on dirac-nambu-goto actions yields the correct schroedinger loop wave equation based on the eguchi
areal quantization of the schild action. inotherwords, the classical eld equations for the p-branes furnish
the rst quantized schroedinger loop wave equations. naively one would expect that a second quantization
will yield a quantum eld theory of p-branes. weinberg has strongly advocated the fact that quantum elds
are not quantized wave functions and that second quantization is a concept that should be banned from
physics [22]. secondly, there are many authors which are prejudice about the whole eld theory approach to
strings and p-branes [23] . in particular, the fact that string feld theory so far has been unable to go beyond
perturbation theory and to capture m theory is a negative sign that suggets that string eld theory is not
on the right ! track. thirdly, as mentioned aerlier, there were no tachyons in the spectrum of [13-15] and
this clearly disagrees with the conventional results obtain from the brst and bfv methods where tachyons
were found in the bosonic string spectrum. nevertheless we believe that the eorts [13-15] are not in vain.
to resolve these paradoxes and to tackle these objections we believe that we must invoke to an extension
of the principle of relativity where all dimensions and signatures must be on the same footing [8,9]. hull
[24] has recently emphasized this important fact in connection to duality and signature changes in string
theory. this is the subject of our next section.

3.2 hints of a new relativity principle : c-spaces

our arguments goes as follows [8] :
so far we have dealt with the schroedinger loop wave equation associated with eguchi areal quantization.
the covariant loop wave equation must treat the areal time a on the same footing as the spatial area or
holographic components  (c). this led the author [8] to write a klein-gordon like master eld equation
in a generalized c-space where point, loops and surface histories were all treated on a single footing and
where the extension of the special relativiy principle transformed each object into one another; i.e the point,
loop and surface histories are reshued into each other under the generalized lorentz transformations which
in c-space amount to area-preserving antisymmetric matrix-coordinates transformations.

this is consistent with the ideas of poly-dimensional-relativity of [9] that purports to treat all dimen-
sions and signatures of spacetime into one single framework of multidimensional or cliord-algebra valued

8

equations . relativistic transformations in poly-dimensional relativity transform a 2-vector into a 3-vector
or into a 5-vector, for example. this occurs also under paralell transport of a p-vector along a closed curve
: the rank of the p-vector can change. dimensions/signatures are on the eye of the beholder. it has been
argued that duality in electromagnetism is linked to signature change rotations [9] since cliord algebras
do distinguish spacetime signatures [9]. for recent results on string dualities and signature changes see hull
[26].

the covariant loop wave functional equation for histories taken place in d = 4 required the use of an
eleven dimensional c-space of 8  8 antisymmetric matrices, x mn ( whose entries have area-dimensions )
encoding the point, loop and surface histories [8] . the entries of such matrix have one scalar part representing
the proper area interval spanned by the motion of the loop in spacetime. another entries correspond to the
6 holographic components  (c). another entry corresponds to the 4 center of mass coordinates of the
loop x
cm . the total number of degress of freedom in d = 4 is equal to 1 + 6 + 4 = 11. the wave equation
we wrote is :

(3  5)
where  is an invariant evolution parameter of areal dimensions extending the role that the proper time of
a point particle path had in special relativity :

x mn ()xmn ()

+ t 2] [x mn ()] = 0.

z d [

2

(3  6)
where gmn p g is a hyper-matrix that generalizes the notion of the ordinary metric tensor g in special
relativity. the generalized lorentz transformations in c-space amount to a change of matrix coordinates
:

(d)2 = gmn p g dx mn dx p g.

x mn = mn

p q (i, j, ....)x p g.

(3  7)
that ensure that the areal interval is invariant : (d)2 = (d)2. it is in this strict sense that  lorentz
transformations in c-space are equivalent to area preserving dis !. special relativity required the intro-
duction of the speed of light, c, to embrace space with time. the new principle of relativity which embraces
points, loops and areas on the same footing requires the introduction of a length scale : the planck length lp
[8]. the extended matrices mn
p q (i, j, ....), or hyper-matrices, depend explicitly on the angles  ,  boosts
parameters : i, j, .... associated with the invariance group in c-space. shortly we will discuss what the
symmetry transformations may look like.

in general, for a membrane we must have a cubic matrix x mn p (2) where 2 will be the invariant 2 +
1 = 3-dim world volume interval and for p branes one must use hyper matrices of the form x m1m2....mp+1(p)
and replace the string tension squared terms with the p-brane tension squared. the wave equation read
identical to (3-5) after replacing  with the p invariant volume interval and the matrices for hyper-matrices.
the result of (3-5) also includes tensionless or null strings. the analog of a photon in c-space are the
null strings/null p-branes.

now we turn to the discussion of how to nd the transformation hyper-matrices appearing in (3-7). this
picture is consistent with the cliord algebraic approach of pezagglia [9] who has argued that one could
write in d = 4 the  multivector valued object : :

c = a + a + a [] + .....a55.

(3  8)
the automorphism group of the cliord algebra in d = 4 will reshuf f le the c-multivector components
: a 2-vector turns into a 3-vector and so forth.
inotherwords, the rank of the tensors change in this
polydimensional relativistic approach. we believe this should be taken seriously because this is a nice
geometrical picture which is able to interrelate all extended objects ( dimensions or ranks) and to encompass
their duality symmetries in one single footing. in addition signature changes are also incorporated in this
picture [9].

to nd out the transformation properties (3-7) it is convenient to study the point particle case. it is
known to the experts that the conformal group action in r4 on the lorentz vector x  can be represented

9

as a mobius like transformation whose parameters a,b,c,d are elemnts of the vahlen matrices [25] . this is
attained by assigning to the vector x  the cliord-algebra (matrix-valued ) object :

(3  9)
( quaternionic and octonionic approaches are also possible for higher dimensions) which allows to dene the
conformal transformation like a mobius like one :

x (x0, x1, x2, x3)  x = xo0 + x11 + x22 + x33.

x = (ax + b)(cx + d)1.

(3  10)
the 2  2 complex vahlen matrices [25] are matrices whose respective entries a,b,c,d are cliord-algebra
valued.
the idea now is to assign to the hyper-matrix x m1,m2,.....mp+1, belonging to the c-space, the cliord-
algebra-valued  multivector  containing respectively : a scalar, an ordinary vector, a 2-vector, a 3-
vector,.....all the components like the ones in eq-(3-8). the scalar would correspond to the invariant proper
volume spanned by the p-loop. the vector to the center of mass coordinates of the p-loop. the 2-vector to
the holographic area components  ; the 3-vector to the 3-volume components and so forth. in this fashion
one would have a 11 correspondence between each of the components of the hyper-matrices x m1,m2,.....mp+1
and the multivector cliord-algebra valued object c given in eq-(3-8).
the second step is to nd the analog of the vahlen matrices, for c , which implemented conformal
transformations in r4 in an elegant way (3-10). to implement the lorentz transformations (3-7) in
c-space, one could start by writing an equation of the form (3-10) where now x are multivector cliord-
valued objects like (3-8) ( corresponding to the hyper-matrices ) and the a,b,c,d would be entries of the
extensions ( generalizations) of the vahlen matrices in c-space. the generalized  lorentz transformations
will reshuf f le the geometry in such a way that a point history will transform into a loop history, for example ;
a membrane history into a p = 5-brane history ....and so forth. in this unied framework all extended objects,
dimensions , are treated on the same footing. quantization of spacetime takes place outside spacetime :
in c-space. this is truly as much background independent as it gets. one does not have a quantization
process in spacetime but of spacetime itself, instead ! this is attained by keeping track ( in c-space ) of the
histories of the points, loops, areas, membranes,...p-branes excitations of spacetime. this is the philosphy
behind the extensive research over the years in the twistor, loop quantum gravity, spacetime foam, spin
networks, histories, topos...approaches to quantum gravity by penrose, isham, rovelli, smolin, ashtekar,
baez and collaborators. c-space, is a categorical space in the true algebraic sense of the word and the
new relativity principle is clearly an extension of the ordinary principle of relativity : dimensions and
signatures are relative, they are in the eye of the beholder [9]. we believe this deserves futher study. the
algebra behind transformations (3-7) based on extensions of the vahlen matrices and the conformal group
will be the subject of future investigation.

schroedinger-like loop wave equations for p branes exactly with the same form as (2-7b, 2-17b) were
also discussed briey ( without derivation) in [8]. pavsic [10] has constructed wave equations for wiggled
p branes based on a fock-schwinger proper time unconstrained formalism at the expense of introducing
auxiliary elds ( the wiggles). his construction also relied on the loop space approach method.

4.1 dirac-like quantum mechanical wave equations for p-branes

4.

a dirac-square root like procedure for the hamilton-jacobi inspired equation (2.7b,2-17b) yields :

z dp(s) [i12......p+1(s)



12......p+1(s)

+ ep] [12......p+1(cp)] = 0.

(4.1)

where no curvature terms have been included. usually when one takes the square of the dirac equation
curvature terms of the type :

[,  ]   r.

10

(4.2)

appear. this results from the fact that a product of two operators ab can always be written as a sum of a
commutator [a, b] and anticommutator {a, b}. the commutator give rise to the curvature terms and the
anticommutator terms to the dalambertian for the ordinary point particle case. we set the curvature terms
to zero to simplify matters; i.e at p-dimensional loop spacetime case. an equation for the string case
similar to (4-1) was given by hosotani [13]. as to the highly nontrivial lorentz and c,p,t transformation
properties of the  eld of (4-1) we also refer to the literature [13-15].  is not a typical dirac spinor , it is
a more complicated object.

the anticommutator of the antisymmetric 12......p+1 matrices is proportional to the unit matrix i :

{12......p+1(s), 12......p+1()} = 2g([12......p+1][12......p+1])p(s  s)i.

(4.3)

with

g([12......p+1][12......p+1]) = g11 g22 ......gp+1p+1 + permutations.

(4.4)
the r.h.s of (4-4) can also be written as the determinant of the (p + 1)  (p + 1) matrix gij whose elements
are gij . the permutations ensure that the generalized metric is antisymmetric under any exchange of
1, 2.....p+1 and 1, 2.....p+1 indices, respectively, and is symmetric under the exchange of the collective
group indices   . notice that the sum of antisymmetrized products of ordinary metrics appears also in
the dolan-tchrakian action (2.24).
since we have assumed that there are no curvatures terms and that for all practical purposes the p-loop
space space is  at, to simplify matters one can assume that the matrices 12......p+1 do not have an
explicit s dependence. in the ordinary d = 4 curved spacetime scenario one introduces the vielbeins ea

in order to dene the cliord algebra in the tangent spacetime and to convert tangent space indices into
curved-spacetime ones. in the simplest case when the matrices do not depend on s the matrices 12......p+1
can be written as linear combinations of sums of antisymmetrized products of ordinary dirac-cliord algeba
matrices :

12......p+1 =

c12......p+1

where a 2d dimensional cliord algebra basis is spanned by the antisymmetrized products of the ordinary

(4.6)

where  are the standard gamma matrices in d dimensions. eqs-(4-3) will in principle determine the
algebraic equations to solve for the coecients c12......p+1
that dene the 12......p+1 matrices (4-5)
based on the fact that each metric component in the r.h.s of eq-(2.20) can be replaced by the anticommutator
{, } = 2gi.

4.2 the de donder-weyl- kanatchikov-navarro approach

a nite dimensional formulation of qft based on the de donder-weyl hamiltonian formalism of the
1930s has been undertaken in the 1990s by kanatchikov and navarro [11, 12 ] where , among other things,
the quantization rules and equations of motion are covariant. the approach [11] is based on lagrangian
systems of the general type l = l(a, a, x) which may include spacetime sources for the elds a
represented by the coordinates x.
a a  l
associated with the polymomentum eld variables

. the generalized covariant legendre transform is h = 


a =

.

(4.7)

. extreme care must be taken not to confuse the latter momentum of eq-(4-7) with the one discussed earlier
(2-5a, 2-5b,....)!. the kanatchikov-navarro construction replaces the schroedinger equation of ordinary
quantum mehanics with one of the covariant dirac-like form :

11

the units are h = 1 and , again, a suitable mass/length parameter  should be inroduced in the l.h.s to
match dimensions. this will be done below. the eld operators have the following correspondence principle
with the classical eld observables :

i = h.

(4.8)

a  i

(4.9)

in the study of p-branes we rstly must be careful with the proper use of indices. we see the p-brane

as a p + 1-dimensional classical eld theory associated with a set of d scalar elds x (a).

if one adpots the conventional view in the literature that the polymomentum is the conjugate to the
jacobians (2-3), the kanatchikov-navarro covariant nite dimensional approach to the quantum eld theory
of p-branes based on quadratic actions of the momentum ( a la schild) yield for wave equation :

haa =

2

 ~x 1.....p+1 ~x1.....p+1.

(4.10)

where the covariant derivative a is given in terms of the spin connection a + 1
[a, b]. the
tangent space gamma matrices, a, and curved space ones, a, are related via the inverse bein elds :
a = ea
aa. also, ordinary derivatives instead of functional derivatives must be used on the wave function
( ~x 1.....p+1; 1, ....p+1) representing the probability amplitude to nd a p-brane in the quantum state 
with a p + 1 world volume ( measure) jacobian equal to the numerical value of ~x 1.....p+1 at each world
volume point p with coordinates ( seen by an observer living on the world volume of the p-brane) given by
1, ....p+1. one must reiterate that  is not a functional of all the possible p-branes world volume measure
eld conf igurations but, instead, one has a function of the numbers that the measure takes at each given
point p = (1, ....p+1).

the classical nambu-goto-dirac string equations of motion have been given by kanatchikov [11] in
terms of the de donder-weyl string polymomentum variables 
a . the author [11] constructed a generalized
graded poisson bracket for forms of arbitary degree using lie derivatives and exterior dierentiation in the
space of vertical and horizontal forms associated with an extended polymomentum phase space. the string
hamiltonian was equal to the square root of a determinant involving quartic powers of the momentum. in a
suitable ortonormal gauge this determinant can be rendered to be quadratic in the momentum variables as
in (4-10). hence, in this gauge the wave equations for the string based on kanatchikovs de donder-weyl
quantization approach are :

haa(x ) = (ia 

x  )2(x ).

(4.11)

the wave function (x ) is in general a cliord-algebra valued object : a hypercomplex number [11]. there
are some similarities with pezagglias equations of polydimensional relativity [9]. the orthonormal gauge
simplies the square root terms. in the ordinary nambu string action, the ortho-normal gauge will render
the nambu-goto action in polynomial form ( the square root terms simplify) :

x 


x


= 0.

(

x 


)2 = (

x 


)2 = 1.

(4.12)

for general p-branes this gauge choice to simplify the square roots will not work because of the intrinsic
nonlinearities of the p-branes. a square root procedure a la dirac that was given by carson, ho and
hosotani eld theory of p-branes [13-15] could be employed here as well.

the kanatchikov-navarro approach to the p-brane quantum mechanical wave equations based on the
de donder-weyl hamiltonian formalism is a sort of a nite dimensional slice of the ( innite dimensional )
quantum eld theory of p-branes based on functional dierential wave equations discussed above. this nite
dimensional approach is certainly worth pursuing because it may yield a suitable regularization mechanism to
extract nite-valued physically relevant information from the innities which plague odinary qft. especially
when one is dealing with such complicated theories as the qft of p-branes.

12

so far we have dealt with f ree wave equations. interactions can naturally be included by means of a
potential and the eld equations will resemble that of a scalar eld with a source proportional to the gradient
of the potential w.r.t the eld variables. this is the subject of future investigations.
