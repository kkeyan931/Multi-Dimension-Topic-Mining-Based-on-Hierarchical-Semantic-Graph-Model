the discrete spectrum of uctuations of the metric about an ads5 black hole background

are found. these modes are the strong coupling limit of so called glueball states in a dual
3-d yang-mills theory with quantum numbers j p c = 2++, 1+, 0++. for the ground state
modes, we nd the mass relation: m(0++) < m(2++) < m(1+). contrary to expectation,
the mass of our new 0++ state (m2 = 5.4573) associated with the graviton is smaller than
the mass of the 0++ state (m2 = 11.588) from the dilaton. in fact the dilatonic excitations
are exactly degenerate with our tensor 2++ states. we nd that variational methods gives

remarkably accurate mass estimates for all three low-lying levels while a wkb treatment

describes the higher modes well.

1. introduction

the maldacena conjecture [1] and its further extensions [2][3] allow us to compute

quantities in a strongly coupled gauge theory from its dual gravity description. in particu-

lar, witten [4] has pointed out if we compactify the 4-dimensional conformal super yang

mills (sym) to 3 dimensions using anti-periodic boundary conditions on the fermions, then

we break supersymmetry and conformal invariance and obtain a theory that has interest-

ing mass scales. in refs. [5] and [6], this approach was used to calculate a discrete mass
spectrum for 0++ states associated with t r[f 2] at strong coupling by solving the dilatons

wave equation in the corresponding gravity description. although the theory at strong

coupling is really not pure yang-mills, since it has additional elds, some rough agreement

was claimed between the pattern of glueball masses thus obtained and the masses com-

puted for ordinary 3-d yang-mills by lattice calculations. in ref. [5] the calculation was

extended to solving the modes of the vector and two form elds with certain polarizations.

several other investigations have expanded our knowledge of the relation between string

theory and gauge theories, in these and related directions [7].

here we consider the discrete spectrum for the graviton eld which is dual to the energy

momentum tensor of the yang-mills eld theory. this is a very interesting case, since a 5-d

graviton eld has ve independent on-shell states that in a dual correspondence to a 4-d
yang-mills theory would account for the ve helicity components of a massive 2++ state

lying on the leading diractive (pomeron) trajectory [8][9]. in the present analysis, these

ve states are mapped by dimensional reduction to a reducible multiplet with quantum
numbers 2++, 1+, 0++ in a 3-d yang mills theory [10]. contrary to expectations, we
nd that the mass gap dened by the lowest 0++ state in the graviton multiplet is lower
in fact our 2++ states are exactly degenerate with the
than mass gap for the dilaton.
lowest dilaton states, which shall be denoted as 0++, while the 1+ equation gives the
most massive states. remarkably these mass relations,

m(0++) < m(0++) = m(2++) < m(1+),

for the lowest modes are reminiscent of weak coupling glueball spectra from lattice gauge

theory or the mit bag model. extensions to the graviton multiplet for states dual to the

4-d yang mills theory will be reported separately.

quite apart from the issue of how closely the gauge theory obtained from the ads

description at strong coupling agrees accidentally with ordinary yang-mills, it is a very

1

interesting fact that one obtains discrete masses representing long lived states in the theory

from a very dierent looking calculation done with the gravity variables. on the gravity
side, if we compactify the ads5 metric on a large s1 then the metric is a periodic version
of the original ads5  s5 metric. at high temperature (small radius of the s1) this metric
is replaced by an ads black hole metric. this geometry has stationary modes for the elds

of string theory (and in particular the elds of supergravity), and it is conjectured that the

spectrum of these modes gives the mass spectrum for the compactied gauge theory on
r3s1. understanding the properties of such a yang-mills theory even at strong coupling
is interesting.

in this paper we carry out the calculation of the discrete modes for the perturbations
of the gravitational metric. we restrict the perturbations to be independent of the s5
factor in the metric and constant in the co-ordinate for the compact s1. our results are

presented as follows.

in sec ii, we derive three dierent wave equations that arise from uctuations in the

gravitational metric. these correspond to spin-2, spin-1 and spin-0 perturbations from the

viewpoint of the rotation group in the 3-dimensional noncompact space:

(i) the spin-2 equation can be mapped by a change of variables to the equation for

a massless scalar, and so the energy levels found are the same as those for the dilaton eld

.

(ii) the spin-1 equation gives energy levels that are somewhat higher than the spin-2

case.

(iii) we rst obtain the spin-0 equation in a gauge which has only diagonal compo-

nents of the metric. we obtain a third order equation for the perturbation. we observe

that there is a one parameter residual gauge freedom left in the ansatz, and we use the

form of this gauge mode to reduce the third order equation to a second order equation

for the perturbation. the situation here is similar to the analysis of polar perturbations

of the 3+1 schwarzschild hole in a diagonal gauge, where a third order system is also

found. we comment on the gauge freedom present in the latter case; this discussion may

illuminate some of the mysteries associated with the existence of the second order zerilli

equation [11] for the above mentioned polar perturbations of the schwarzschild metric. as

a check on our result, we then study the perturbation in an alternative gauge, similar to

one used by regge and wheeler [12]. in this latter gauge we directly obtain a second order

equation, which is seen to be equivalent to the equation obtained by the rst method.

2

in sec iii, we solve these equations numerically. we comment of the issue of the

boundary condition to be used at the horizon of the black hole: the physics we impose

is that there be no ux transfer across the horizon of the black hole, in agreement with

the boundary condition used in ref. [6] . (in appendix b, we also show that the desired
boundary conditions at r = 1 and r =  together allow us to treat these equations in a
sturm-liouville approach.) we present accurate numerical solutions to the rst 10 levels.

the spin-0 equation gives energy levels that are lower than the spin-1 and spin-2 equations.

in sec iv, we consider approximation methods to gain insight into the mass relations.

the ground state mass is also given in terms of a very simple variational ansatz and the

entire spectrum approximated very well by a low-order wkb approximation. we also

demonstrate how the boundary condition at the horizon can be implemented more eec-

tively with the help of an eective angular momentum. (technical details are postponed

to appendix b on the variational method, appendix c on the schrodinger form of the

wave equations and appendix d on the derivation of the wkb expansion.)

in sec v, we discuss the results and make a few cautionary remarks on the diculties

of the comparison of this strong coupling spectrum with glueballs as computed in lattice

gauge theory or classied in bag models. we recommend a more thorough analysis of

the complete set of spin-parity states for the entire bosonic supergravity multiplet and its

extension to 4-d yang mills models.

1.1. ads/cft correspondence at finite temperature

let us review briey the proposal for getting a 3-d yang-mills theory dual to super-

gravity. one begins by considering type iib supergravity in euclidean 10-dimensional
spacetime with the topology m5  s5. the maldacena conjecture asserts that iib su-
perstring theory on ads5  s5 is dual to the n = 4 sym conformal eld theory on the
boundary of the ads space. the metric of this spacetime is

ds2/r2

ads = r2(d 2 + dx2

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

3) +

dr2
r2 + d2
5 ,

(1.1)

ads = gsn 2 (gs is the string
where the radius of the ads spacetime is given through r4
s = ). the euclidean time is  = ix0. to break
coupling and ls is the string length, l2
conformal invariance, following [4], we place the system at a nonzero temperature described

by a periodic euclidean time  =  + 2r0. the metric correspondingly changes, for small
enough r0, to the non-extremal black hole metric in ads space. for large black hole

3

temperatures, the stable phase of the metric corresponds to a black hole with radius large

compared to the ads curvature scale. to see the physics of discrete modes we may take

the limit of going close to the horizon of this large hole, whereupon the metric reduces to

that of the black 3-brane. this metric is (we scale out all dimensionful quantities)

ds2 = f (r)d 2 + f1(r)dr2 + r2(dx1

3) + d2
5 ,

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

where

f (r) = r2 

1
r2

(1.2)

(1.3)

on the gauge theory side, we have a n = 4 susy theory corresponding to the ads
spacetime, but with the s1 compactication we have this theory on a circle with antiperi-

odic boundary conditions for the fermions. thus supersymmetry is broken and massless

scalars are expected to acquire quantum corrections.

from the view point of a 3-d theory, the compactication radius acts as an uv cut-

o. before the compactication the 4-d theory was conformal, and was characterized by
a dimensionless eective coupling (g(4)
y m )2n  gsn . after the compactication the theory
is not conformal, and the radius of the compact circle provides a length scale. let this

radius be r. then a naive dimensional reduction from 4-d yang-mills to 3-d yang-mills,
would give an eective coupling in the 3-d theory equal to (g(3)
y m )2n/r.
this 3-d coupling has the units of mass. if the dimensionless coupling (g(4)
y m )2n is much
less than unity, then the length scale associated to this mass is larger than the radius of

y m )2n = (g(4)

compactication, and we may expect the 3-d theory to be a dimensionally reduced version
of the 4-d theory. unfortunately the dual supergravity description applies at (g(4)
y m )2n >>
1, so that the higher kaluza-klein modes of the s1 compactication have lower energy than

the mass scale set by the 3-d coupling. thus we do not really have a 3-d gauge theory

with a nite number of additional elds.

one may nevertheless expect that some general properties of the dimensionally re-

duced theory might survive the change between small and large coupling. for this purpose

we look at the pattern of masses and spins that are obtained for the elds that are singlets
under the s1 - i.e. we ignore the kaluza-klein modes of the s1. in keeping with earlier

work, we also restrict ourselves to modes that are singlets of the so(6), since non-singlets
under the s1 and the so(6) can have no counterparts in a dimensionally reduced qcd3.

2. wave equations

2.1. field equations and the equilibrium conguration

we consider type iib supergravity in euclidean 10-dimensional spacetime. the space-
time will have the topological form m5  s5. for the perturbations that we are interested
in, we can set to zero the dilaton , the axion c and the 2-form elds bnsns, brr. the

metric and the 4-form gauge eld satisfy the einstein equation

r  =

1
6

f   f  



and the self-duality condition for the eld strength of the four form

f   =

1
5!

          f        

(2.1)

(2.2)

indices with a hat are 10-d indices. the coordinates of the s5 will be called
notations:
y, and the indices here will be , , . . .. the coordinates of m will be x, and the indices

will be , , . . .. the  tensor is real in spacetime with lorentzian signature, and thus pure
imaginary in euclidean signature. thus f will be real on s5, and imaginary on m5.

the equilibrium conguration about which we perturb will be given by the metric

ds2 = f (r)d 2 + f1(r)dr2 + r2(dx1

3) + d2
5

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

where

f (r) = r2 

1
r2

(2.3)

(2.4)

the last term in (2.3) gives the metric of s5 and we have chosen units to make this a
sphere of unit radius. the 5-form eld strength with indices in the s5 is a constant times
the volume form on s5. by the self duality condition (2.2) we have

f f  



= 2g

where

is a positive constant.

(2.5)

(2.6)

2.2. ansatz for the perturbations

we wish to consider uctuations of the metric of the form

g = g + h (x)

(2.7)

thus the perturbations will have no dependence on the coordinates of the s5. further,

we wish to keep unchanged all the other elds in the theory.
it is easy to see that
, c, bnsns, brr can be held xed, since they arise quadratically in the action, and

vanish in the equilibrium conguration. (the metric above is the einstein metric, and

so there is no linear coupling of h to the dilaton.) it is also consistent to hold xed the
geometry of the s5 and the 5-form eld-strength on the s5. keeping these quantities xed
keeps unchanged the ux of f on s5, which is one constraint that the perturbations must

respect. the self duality condition (2.2) can then regarded as determining the value of f

on m . but then we see that we will still get after such a perturbation:

f f  



= 2g

with  the same constant as in (2.6). the einstein equations then give

r = 

1
3

g

(2.8)

(2.9)

here the ricci tensor r can be computed solely from the 5-d metric of m ; all contri-
butions involving the s5 variables are zero. thus if we nd a solution to (2.9), we have a

consistent solution the to entire supergravity problem. with the expansion (2.7) we get

(2.10)

where d = 5.

to see how many kinds of modes we expect, consider rst the graviton in 5-d at
spacetime with coordinates xi, i = 1, . . . 5, and signature ( + + + +). then the graviton
modes can be brought by gauge freedom to a form

h =  eik(x2x1), ,  = 3, 4, 5,


 = 0

(2.11)

thus there are 5 independent polarizations of the graviton.

in the spacetime (2.3) the coordinates x1, x2, x3 project to the 3-d spacetime of the
gauge theory that we wish to study,  is direction of the gauge theory that is compactied in

6

obtaining the 3-d theory from the 4-d theory, and r is the radial coordinate of the spacetime

that loosely speaking governs the scale at which the gauge theory is being studied. our

perturbations will have the form

h =  (r)emx3

(2.12)

where we have chosen to use x3 as a euclidean time direction to dene the glueball masses
of the 3-d gauge theory. we start with xing for the gravitational perturbations the gauge

h3 = 0

(2.13)

though later we will have occasion to consider changes to another gauge as well.

2.3. wave equations for the perturbations

from the above ansatz and the metric (2.3) we see that we have an so(2) rotational
symmetry in the x1  x2 space, and we can classify our perturbations with respect to this
symmetry. we then nd the following categories of perturbations:

(a) spin-2: there are two linearly independent perturbations which form the spin-2 rep-

resentation of the above so(2):

h12 = h21 = qt (r)emx3,

all other components zero

(2.14)

h11 = h22 = qt (r)emx3,

all other components zero

(2.15)

the einstein equations (2.10) give,

r2(1 

1
r4 )qt (r) + r(1 +

3
r4 )qt (r) + [

m2
r2  4(1 +

r4 )]qt (r) = 0.

dening

eq. (2.16) becomes

t =

r2

r2(1

r4 )t (r) + r(5 

1
r4 )t (r) +

m2
r2 t (r) = t ;

 = 0,

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

which is the free wave equation, and thus the same equation as that satised by the
dilaton (with constant value on the s5). these dilaton modes have been studied

in [5][6] for example , and we therefore will obtain the same energy levels for the

7

spin-2 perturbations as those obtained for the dilaton, e.g., for the ground state,
m2

t,0  11.588.

(b) spin-1:

hi = h i = qv (r)emx3, i = 1 or i = 2,

all other components zero

(2.19)

the einstein equations (2.10) give,

r2(1 

1
r4 )qv (r) + r(1 

1
r4 )qv (r) + [

m2
r2  4(1 

1
r4 )]qv (r) = 0

(2.20)

(c) spin-0: based on the symmetries we choose an ansatz where the nonzero components

of the perturbation are

h11 = h22 = q1(r)emx3

h  = 2q1(r)
hrr = q3(r)emx3

f (r)
r2 emx3 + q2(r)emx3

(2.21)

where f (r) is given in (2.4). we have chosen to express h  in such a way so that the

part involving q1 is traceless, which we expect is to dominate at large r.

the analysis of the einstein equations are given in appendix a, where they are derived

in the above gauge and also in a dierent gauge which is less directly related to the

at space form, (2.11), but more easy to solve:

h  = q1(r)emx3

hrr = q2(r)emx3

hr3 = h3r = q3(r)emx3

the eld equation is, for q3  qs(r),

where

d2
dr2 + p1(r)

d
dr

(cid:8)p2(r)

+ p0(r)(cid:9)qs(r) = 0,

p2(r) = r2(r4  1)2[3(r4  1) + m2r2]
p1(r) = r(r4  1)[3(r4  1)(5r4 + 3) + m2r2(7r4 + 5)]
p0(r) = 9(r4  1)3 + 2m2r2(3 + 2r4 + 3r8) + m4r4(r4  1).

(2.24)

3. numerical solution

to calculate the discrete spectrum for our three equation, one must apply the correct
boundary conditions at r = 1 and r = . from the indicial equations, the asymptotic
value of the two linearly independent solutions at innity are

qt (r)  r2, r2
qv (r)  r2, r2,
qs(r)  r3, r1 ,

and at r = 1 are

qt (r)  1, log(r  1) ,
qv (r)  r  1, (r  1)log(r  1) ,
qs(r)  (r  1)1, (r  1)1log(r  1) .

(3.1)

(3.2)

in all cases the appropriate boundary condition [6] at r = 1 is the one without the
logarithmic singularity. at r =  the least singular boundary is required to have a
normalizable eigenstate. matching these two boundary conditions results in a discrete set
of eigenvalues m2
n, where n is the number of zeros in the wave function inside the interval
r  (1, ). we solved the eigenvalue equations by the shooting method, integrating
from r1  1 to large r  . the parameter m2 is adjusted by applying newtons
method to satisfy the condition limr q(r) = 0. to begin the integration one needs the
function and its rst derivative at r = 1. thus expanding to the next signicant order

for the regular solution at r = 1, the initial conditions for the tensor were taken to be
qt (r1) = 1, qt (r1) = 2  m2/4 and for the vector to be qv (r1) = 0, qv (r1) = 1. for the
scalar equation, we found it convenient to dene an new function, fs(r) = (r2  1)qs (r)/r,
so that the initial value is nonsingular and only the correct solution at innity vanishes.
this leads to initial conditions, fs(r1) = 1, fs(r1) = m2/4.

below we present in table 1 the rst 10 states using this shooting method. the

spin-2 equation is equivalent to the dilaton equation solved in refs. [5] and [6], so the

excellent agreement with earlier values validates our method. in all of the equation we use
a standard mathematica routine with boundaries taken to be x = r2  1 =  and 1/x = 
reducing  gradually to  = 106. note that since all our eigenfunctions must be even in r
with nodes spacing in x = r2  1 of o(m2), the variable 1/x is a natural way to measure
the distance to the boundary at innity. for both boundaries, the values of  was varied

eect the answer.

4. main features of glueball spectrum

there are two intriguing aspects of our numerical results for the glueball spectrum.

the rst concerns the pattern of low-mass states, e.g., for the respective ground states,
one has: m2
v,0. the second interesting feature is the asymptotic growth for
the masses of their radial excitations. in order to provide further insights concerning these

t,0 < m2

s,0 < m2

features, we turn next to approximation schemes appropriate for discussing: (1) ground

state masses, and (2) high mass excitations. we end this section by providing a heuristic

picture for understanding these main features.

4.1. low-mass spectrum

eq. (2.18) for tensor modes can be expressed in a standard sturm-liouville form

where we have found it more convenient to use x  r2  1 as the new variable. for
tensor modes, the potential term is in fact absent, i.e., wt (x) = 0. eq. (2.20) for vector

+ w(x)(cid:17)(x) =

(x)

,

(4.1)

d

(cid:16) 

10

modes can also be brought into this form, with v (x)  qv (r)/r4  1 and wv (x) =

1/(x(x + 1)(x + 2)). as a sturm-liouville system nding various excitations can be carried

out by applying the minimum principle.

using the fact that the ground state energy in such a system corresponds to the

absolute minimum of its energy functional, we can prove rigorously an inequality

m2

t,0 < m2

v,0,

(4.2)

between the masses for the tensor and the vector ground states. this inequality follows
immediately from the fact that the potential function for vector modes, wv (x), is strictly
positive over the range 0 < x < . (see appendix b.)

we next apply a variational approach to obtain upper bounds for the respective

ground state masses. simple trial wave functions satisfying the respective tensor and
vector boundary conditions at x = 0 and at x   are t (x) = (x + 1)2 and
v (x) = (x + 1)3px(x + 2). one readily obtains the following simple upper bounds

for the ground state masses:

m2

t,0  12,

and

m2

v,0  20.

(4.3)

these values compare very well with the precise numerical answers: m2
t,0 = 11.588 and
m2
v,0 = 18.676. one can easily improve these already impressive bounds by using a better
variational ansatz. for instance, using t (x) = (x + 1/x + ) t (x) and v (x) = (x +
1/x + ) v (x), with  as variational parameter, we obtain

m2

t,0  11.588,
m2
v,0  18.687,

for  = 2.0857 ,

for  = 1.1729 .

(4.4)

(4.5)

the situation for scalar modes is slightly more involved. nevertheless, an analogous

analysis can also be carried out, as explained in appendix b. for scalar wave-functions,
s(x)  (r4 1)qs(r)/r, the simplest choice for ground-state trial function consistent with
boundary conditions at x = 0 and x   is s(x) = constant, which leads to an upper
bound for the scalar ground-state mass:

m2

s,0  5.5213.

(4.6)

observe immediately that this upper bound is already very close to the exact numerical
result: m2
s,0 = 5.4573. an improved variational bound can obviously be obtained, as was
done for both the tensor and the vector ground states. it is also important to note that

this simple variational upper bound for the scalar ground state is already much lower than

the mass for the tensor ground state.

11

4.2. wkb estimates for high-mass excitations

we next focus on high-mass excitations by carrying out a wkb analysis. we begin

by rst converting our sturm-liouville type equations into radial type schroedinger

equations,

(cid:0)  h2 d2

dx2 + v (x; m2)(cid:1)(x) = e(x),

(4.7)

where e  0.
introduced a formal expansion parameter h, which at the end of the calculation we set

in keeping with the standard practice of wkb methods we have also

back to h = 1. the relations between the new set of wave functions, v (x), t (x) and
s(x), and the previous set, v (x), v (x) and s(x), are given in appendix c. note that,
in this approach, eigenvalue parameter m2 appears as a parameter in an eective potential,

and it controls the strength of central force necessary in forming zero-energy bound
states. for all three cases, when m2 becomes large, it can be shown that each potential

approaches a smooth large-m limit:

v (x; m2)  m2v0(x) + 0(1),

v0(x) = 

4x(x + 1)(x + 2)

1

.

(4.8)

by dividing eq.

(4.7) by m2, we observe that, in the large m-limit, h and m appear

naturally in a simple ratio, h/m. therefore, a large-m limit is formally the same as

asmall-h limit. (strictly speaking, this is not the case for our scalar equation.) or less
formally stated, as we observe in our numerical solutions, the mass eigenvalues m2

n increase
monotonically with the number of zeros n in the wave function so that the large eigenvalues

expansion is also a short distance limit, as expected.

for bound-state problems, the wkb consistency condition for eigenvalues m = mn

for n = 0, 1, 2,      , is given as an expansion in h,

(n +

1
2

) h = i0(m) + h2 i2(m) + h2 i4(m) +     

,

(4.9)

where the coecients i2k(m) are expressed as an integral between two classical turning
points over integrand expressed in term of the potential. since the leading behavior of the
integrals are i2k(m)  m12k at large m, we obtain an asymptotic expansion in 1/m at
h = 1. systematically expanding in 1/m, the wkb condition takes the form:

(n +

1
2

)  = s0 m + s1 +

s2
m

+    ,

(4.10)

12

where coecients si are easily calculable.

we have shown in appendix d that, in order to obtain the rst two coecients, s0

and s1, it is sucient to consider only the leading order wkb contribution,

i0(m) =z xr

xl

dxrv (x; m2) 

1 + 4
4x2 ,

(4.11)

where xl(m) and xr(m) are two classical turning points with   0+. the shift from
v (x; m2) to v (x; m2) + 1
4x2 , rst discussed by k. e. langer [13], is commonly known as
the langer correction.
it incorporates the correction at the singular boundary when
there is a centrifugal term, l(l + 1)/x2, in a radial wave equation. furthermore we have
added an  term, 1/4x2  (1 + 4)/4x2, as a simple procedure for properly implementing
the threshold behavior for (x) at x = 0. (see appendix d.)

from eq. (4.11), one notes that i0(m) can be a non-trivial function of m through its
dependence in v (x; m2) and on the two classical turning points, xl(m) and xr(m). since

v  m2 for m large, it follows that i0(m) = m(cid:0)i0,0 + m1 i0,1 + m2 i0,2 +  (cid:1) at large m.

consequently s0 = i0,0, and s1 = i0,1. (to obtain s2, one will also need to calculate i2.)
truncating eq.(4.10) to this order and solving for m2, one obtains the following expansion
for the mass spectrum,[14]

m2
n/2  n2 +  n +  ,

(4.12)

where 2, , and  are related to s0, s1 and s2 by  = /s0 ,  = 1  2s1/, and
 = 2/4  2s0s2/2.

we have carried out this wkb analysis for all three cases, and have obtained the fol-
lowing interesting results. first, we have found that the leading coecient, 2, is universal,
i.e.,

is the same for tensor, vector, and scalar modes. therefore, it is also the same as that
for the dilaton modes, with 2  5.742 . second, for the term linear in n, simple integer
coecients are obtained for both the tensor and vector modes:

however, for scalar modes, a more intricate calculation is needed. we nd that

t = 3

v = 4.

in figure 1, we show a comparison on a log-log plot of our wkb prediction to our direct

lowest scalar mass, our wkb results agree with the actual data extremely well, with
constants, t  2.011, v  3.283, and s  1.25 tted to the asymptotic form at large
n. higher order wkb results and other related work will be reported elsewhere.

in spite of this impressive agreement between the low order wkb calculations and

the exact numerical results, a cautionary note should be added. as pointed out in ref [5],

the question of convergence of 1/m-expansion for the logarithm of wave functions, v (x),

v (x) and s(x), remains to be addressed.

14

4.3. heuristic picture:

m2

it is possible to provide a qualitative understanding for both the low-mass pattern,
v,0, and the asymptotic high-mass excitations by making use of a quan-
tum mechanical analogy. for m large, eq. (4.8) formally corresponds to a screened

t,0 < m2

s,0 < m2

attractive coulomb potential, with a bare charge q at the core,

q = 

m2
8

+ 0(1).

(4.17)

more generally, we have shown in appendix c that, for all three cases, each potential,
v (x; m2), behaves near x  0 as

v (x; m2) 

l2
x2 +

q
x

+ 0(1).

(4.18)

this naturally suggests that we identify l2 = l(l + 1) as angular momentum squared and
q as the unscreened bare charge at the core. we nd that lv = 0, and lt = ls =  1
2 .

our boundary condition for  at x = 0 corresponds to choosing (x)  xl+1 over
2 , this would correspond to always selecting the regular solutions.
2 , we shall in

 xl. for re l   1
in order to avoid the degeneracy ambiguity for the case where lt = ls =  1
what follows always assume that lt = ls =  1

2 +  and consider the limit   0+.

when we include the langer correction, v  v + ( 1

(4.19)

at large m2, (4.19) leads to (4.17), in agreement with eq. (4.8). more generally, since
v (x; m2)  m2v0(x) for all three cases, this explains our nding that the coecient 2 is
universal. the next order correction, , will depend on how v (x; m2) deviates away from
m2v0(x), both at x  0 and at x  . indeed, as we show in appendix d that our results
for t , v and s follow directly after we have identied the leading asymptotic behavior
of v at x = 0 and at x = .

turning next to the low-mass spectrum. in this analog picture, the vector ground state

is more massive since it corresponds to a higher angular momentum state when compared

15

v > l2

to the tensor ground state, l2
s, and therefore a stronger binding, (larger m2), is
required in order to form a zero-energy bound state. in contrast, the tensor modes and
the scalar modes have the same angular momenta, l2
s =  > 0. we nd that the
scalar potential-well is deeper than that for the tensor modes, especially when m2 is

t = l2

small. indeed, whereas the coulomb core for tensor modes only become attractive when
m2  12, it is always attractive for the scalar modes, with minimum attraction at m2 = 4.
therefore, less binding is required in forming a zero-energy scalar bound state, and it is

consistent with the fact that the scalar ground state is lighter than the tensor mode.

5. discussion

we have computed the discrete spectrum of metric perturbations in an ads5 black

hole background. we would like to end by briey discussing our results and making a few

cautionary remarks on the diculties of the comparison of this strong coupling spectrum

with glueball masses as computed in lattice gauge theory or classied in bag models.

as stressed in ref. [6], in order to obtain these discrete modes, a non-singular bound-

ary condition must be applied at the horizon of the black hole and requiring normalizibility

of wave-functions alone is insucient for such a purpose. a deeper understanding on the

physics of the boundary condition used would be highly desirable. our discussion has

also been restricted to modes that are singlets under the so(6) symmetry and the nite

temperature kluza klein u(1) gauge group. as a guide to nding states that might

survive the dimensionally reduced limit, concentrating on states that are non-singlets in
so(6)  u (1) appears reasonable.

earlier comparisons for qcd3 have noted an apparent agreement between the ratio,
m(0)/m(0++) = 1.45  0.03, found in weak coupling lattice simulations and the ratio,
m(0)/m(0++)  1.50, found at strong coupling from supergravity, using the lowest
state of the pseudoscalar mode (b) and the lowest state of the dilaton (). our new
lower mass 0++ state will somewhat upset this quantitative correspondence. with a much

smaller value for the scalar mass, this supergravity mass-ratio becomes 3.19 which is too

large by a factor of two.

however, the earlier agreement was inexplicably good in any case. from the point of
view of a 3-d yang-mills theory at weak coupling the lowest 0++ state should couple to
both the operator s = t r[f 2
 (x)]  1
tensor t = t r[f 2

 (x)] and the helicity-0 component of the energy-momentum
4  s, which are associated with the dilaton and the scalar

16

component of the metric uctuations respectively.
indeed each of these operators have
contributions from the  -component of a along the s1 compact direction, which from the
view point of 3-d yang-mills theory is an adjoint higgs eld. the state associated with

the higgs mode must decouple at weak coupling if there is a pure yang-mills xed point.

a second feature that has previously been noted is the similarity in the level spacing

of the excitation spectrum of supergravity states and the spectrum of the excited glueball

spectrum in lattice simulations. in our view, this is even more problematic. for one thing,
we have so far ignored kluza-klein excitations in the compact s1 direction that have a
level spacing given by mkk = 1/r  2b, where r is the size of the compactied circle
and the parameter b so dened has units of mass. this spacing is of the same order as the
mass gap for the lowest 0++ state: m(0++)  5.457 b  2.3 b. this suggests that the

proper identication of the excitation spectrum of the supergravity modes with states in

yang-mills theory is non-trivial. in quarkless qcd, all mass splittings are controlled by a
single mass scale, qcd in 4-d or g2
3n in 3-d, which one may equally well take as the string
tension, . in the strong coupling limit on the lattice, this scale is replaced by the uv
cut-o (or inverse lattice spacing a1). in these units both the lattice glueball masses and
the string tension diverge as log(g2n ) or log(ag2

3n ), whereas in the supergravity scenario
at strong coupling the putative 3-d glueball masses go to constants while ads string

tensions diverges as

4gsn b2

2

,

 =

(5.1)

in leading order in strong coupling. it may be that lattice glueball excitations are transverse

stringy uctuations that would not survive in the the supergravity approximation. in that

case, from a lattice view point, there should be no innite tower of glueball states. the

supergravity spectrum describes radial (5-th dimensional) excitations that either do not

survive the weak coupling nite n limit or are mixed with stringy states. it is dicult to

see what should be the precise comparison between these two sets of excitations since they

have quite dierent physical features. we consider the understanding of the correspondence

of this tower of states with yang-mills theory at the boundary to be an important unsolved

issue.

in spite of these reservations, we believe that a comparison between the supergravity

results and lattice as well as bag model results does oer opportunities to uncover phe-

nomenologically interesting features. for instance, in the mass relations for the lowest

17

states as a function of their quantum numbers, we do see a pattern reminiscent of lattice

glueball spectra. indeed the pattern,

m(0++) < m(0++) = m(2++) < m(1+)

is generic to both lattice calculations in 3-d and bag calculations, which are in excellent

agreement with each other. we nd that the classication of states with low-dimension

color singlet elds in a bag picture for glueballs, i.e., in terms of valence-glue, follows the

same pattern as the expected in the ads/cft correspondence. a fuller understanding of

these relationships is certainly worth pursuing. first it is evident from our analysis above
that all 128 lowest bosonic modes for the supergraviton multiplet that are so(6)  u (1)
singlets need to be found. for 3-d yang-mills, it may be also more fruitful to make

comparisons with high temperature lattice qcd4 results, where the constant kk adjoint

eld in the compact  direction still remains.

our current exercise needs to be extended to schemes for 4-d qcd such as the -
nite temperature versions of ads7  s4. as has been suggested elsewhere, the goal may
be to nd that background metric that has the phenomenologically best strong coupling

limit. this can then provide an improved framework for eorts to nd the appropriate

formulation of a qcd string and for addressing the question of pomeron intercept in

qcd. [8][9] in addition, a more thorough analysis of the complete set of spin-parity states

for the entire bosonic supergravity multiplet and its extension to 4-d yang-mills models is

also worthwhile. results on these computations will be reported in a future publication.

appendix a. field equation for spin-0 perturbation:

let us start with the gauge where the nonzero components of the spin-0 perturbation

are

h11 = h22 = q1(r)emx3

h  = 2q1(r)
hrr = q3(r)emx3

f (r)

the einstein equations (2.10) give

[2r8q2(r)  r5(r4  1)q2,r(r) + 4(r4  1)q1(r)]emx3

(a.2)

and one rst order and one second order equation in q1 and q2:

4r(3r4  1)q1,r + 3r5(r4 + 1)q2,r  8(3r4 + 1)q1

(a.4)

+ 3]q2 = 0

r2
r4  1

we can nd q2 from (a.4) and substitute it into (a.3) to obtain a third order equation for

q1:

r3(r4  1)2[m2r2 + 3(r4  1)]q1,rrr
+r2(r4  1)[m4r4 + 2m2r2(r4 + 5) + 3r2(r4  1)2(3r4 + 5)]q1,rr

+[m6r6 + m4r4(r4 + 3)  2m2r2(13 + 2r4 + r8) + 48(r4  1)2]q1 = 0

(a.5)

it may appear strange that we have obtained a third order system (which needs three

constants of integration) instead of a second order system as in the spin-2 and spin-1 cases

above. the source of this extra freedom is that the gauge (2.13) there is a one parameter

freedom left in the present ansatz:

(a.10)

a similar third order system of equations arises in the study of polar perturbations

of the schwarzschild metric, in the gauge where the metric is constrained to be diagonal.

one discovers a combination of elds that remarkably satisfy a second order equation,

the zerilli equation

[11]. but we can see that such a reduction is to be expected because

here again there is a one parameter family of dieomorphisms that preserves the gauge

condition. consider a metric of the form

ds2 = k(r)dt2 + k1(r)dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2)

(a.11)

then if we are looking at perturbations with frequency  in time t, then we have the

following dieomorphisms which leaves the metric within the chosen gauge (o diagonal

components zero):

pl()et



h(r)
r2 ),rpl()et

  + h(r)
r r  r2(
t t  h(r)pl()et

where for innitesimal 

h(r) = rk(r)1/2.

(a.12)

(a.13)

(pl() is the associated legendre polynomial in cos .) we can use this solution to reduce
the third order system to a second order equation.

20

but for the schwarzschild metric one can choose a dierent gauge, where such a

residual gauge freedom does not exist. such a gauge was used in [12]. we thus look for a

gauge in our problem which would also have no residual gauge symmetry, and so directly

yield a second order equation.

consider the gauge where the nonzero components of the perturbation are

h  = q1(r)emx3

hrr = q2(r)emx3

hr3 = h3r = q3(r)emx3

the einstein equations (2.10) determine q2 and q1 in terms of q3:

q2 = 

r5(r4  1)q1,r + 2r8q1
(r4  1)2(3r4  1)

(a.14)

(a.15)

q1 =

2(r4  1)

mr5[m2r2 + 3(r4  1)]

and give a second order equation for:

[3r(r81)q3,r +(3(r4 +1)(3r4 +1)+m2r2(3r41))q3] (a.16)

r2(r4  1)2(3(r4  1)+m2r2)q3,rr + r(r4  1)[3(r4  1)(5r4 + 3) + m2r2(7r4 + 5)]q3,r

+[9(r4  1)3+2m2r2(3 + 2r4 + 3r8) + m4r4(r4  1)]q3 = 0.

(a.17)

this is eq. (2.23), where we have re-labeled q3 by qs. this second order equation is related
to the second order equation (a.10) by the transformation

q1 =

(1 + r2)m2/4
r2(1  r2)m2/4 qs

where  (x) = x(x + 1)(x + 2) and (x) = 1

4 . the set of eigenfunctions, {n}, provides a
0 dx(x)n(x)m(x) = m,n. it is well-known
that solving for this set of eigenfunctions and their corresponding eigenvalues is equivalent

complete orthonormal basis: < n|m >r 

to nding stationery points of the following energy functional,

0 dx[ (x)(x)2 + w(x)(x)2]

[]  r 

0 dx(x)(x)2.

r 

21

(b.2)

at each stationery point, n, one has [n] = m2
n. since both  (x) and w(x) are positive,
[] is bounded from below and is in fact positive. in particular, the square of the mass
for the lowest state, m2

0 = [0], is the absolute minimum of [], and m2

0 > 0.

let us denote {t /v }[] as the energy functional for the tensor and vector modes
respectively. we shall next apply this formalism to obtain a simple and yet important

mass inequality:

m2

v,0 > m2

t,0.

denote the the lowest tensor and vector masses by mv,0 and mt,0 respectively. since each

corresponds to the absolute minimum of its energy functional, it follows that

0 < m2

t,0 = t [t

0 ]  t [];

0 < m2

v,0 = v [v

0 ]  v [].

(b.3)

alternatively, m2

v,0 can also be expressed as m2

v,0 =< wv >0 +t [v

0 ], where

< wv >0 r 
r 

0 dxwv (x)v
0 dx(x)v

2
0 (x)
0 (x)2 .

note that wv (x) = 1/(x(x + 1)(x + 2)) is a positive function for 0  x < ; it follows
that < wv >0 is positive, and

m2

v,0 > t [v

0 ].

(b.4)

on the other hand, since m2

t,0 is the absolute minimum of t , we also have the following

inequality,

t [v

0 ] > t [t

0 ] = m2

t,0.

(b.5)

from (b.4) and (b.5), the mass inequality between vector and tensor ground states,
m2

t,0, eq. (4.2), follows.

v,0 > m2

it is also worth pointing out that, in re-deriving these eigenvalue equations from the

energy functional, it is necessary to impose boundary conditions

 (x)(x)(x)  0,

(b.6)

both for x  0 and x  . this states more clearly what boundary condition is to be used
at the horizon of the black hole. in particular, this rules out the solution where (x)  log x
at x = 0. to be more precise, by examining our dierential equations, eq. (4.1), both

22

at x = 0 and at x  , eq. (b.6) requires that tensor and vector wave-functions must
behave as

t (x)  x2,

x  ,
t (x)  constant, v (x)  x1/2, x  0.

v (x)  x2,

(b.7)

we next address the question of scalar modes. let us rst convert eq. (2.18) into

lss(x) (cid:16) (cid:0)

d
dx

s(x; m2)

d

dx(cid:1) + ws(x; m2)(cid:17)s(x) = 0,

(b.8)

where

,

x(x + 2)

s(x; m2) =

[3x(x + 2) + m2(x + 1)]

m2[(3x2 + 6x + 4)  m2(x + 1)]
4(x + 1)[3x(x + 2) + m2(x + 1)]2 .
(b.9)
here, s(x) is related to qs(r) in (2.18) by s(x) = x(x+2)
x+1 qs(r). since m2 enters into
the dierential equation in a rather non-trivial fashion, we are unable to directly convert
this into a sturm-liouville problem with m2 as eigenvalues. let us consider instead the

ws(x; m2) =

following eigenvalue problem:

lsn(x) = ens(x)n(x),

(b.10)

where e0 < e1 < e2 <    , and s(x) is at this point unspecied. this in turn can be
obtained via a sturm-liouville type variational approach, i.e., nding stationery points of

the following energy functional:

s[]  r 

0 dx(cid:0)s(x; m2)|(x)|2 + ws(x; m2)|(x)|2(cid:1)

r 
0 dxs(x)|(x)|2.

.

(b.11)

note that, here, m2 is to be treated as a parameter. to have a properly dened stationery
conditions, we require s(x; m2)(x)(x) = 0, both at x = 0 and x  . this, in turn,
xes our boundary conditions. a careful examination indicates that the desired boundary

conditions for s(x) are

s(x)  constant,

(b.12)

for both x   and x  0.

since ws(x; m2) is no longer positive, neither is s[]. nevertheless, s[] is still
bounded from below since ws(x; m2) is. as such, we identify e2
n(m2) = s[n], in increas-
ing order, at each local minimum, n. in particular, e0(m2) is the absolute minimum of

23

s, although it no longer is positive in general. this generalized sturm-liouville prob-
lem reduces to our scalar problem if a zero-energy solution exists. to be more precise, one
needs to answer the following question: for what values of m2
j , j = 0, 1, 2,   , will there
be a zero-energy solution where e2
j ) = 0 ? as a minimum problem, we are searching
for m2
0] = 0. turning
this into a variational problem, we require that, for m2 > m2

the integral on the right vanishes provides an upper bound for m2
in arriving at our
0.
bound for the scalar ground-state mass, eq. (4.6), the trial function s(x) = constant,
was used.

appendix c. radial schroedinger representation and eective potentials:

in order to bring our ode, eq. (4.1), into the radial schroedinger form, eq. (4.7),

we perform the following transformation:

1

2 t (x),

1

2 v (x),

t (x) =(cid:0)x(x + 1)(x + 2)(cid:1)
v (x) =(cid:0)x(x + 1)(x + 2)(cid:1)
s(x) =(cid:0)

3x(x + 2) + m2(x + 1)(cid:1)

m2x(x + 2)

1

2 s(x).

the resulting eective potentials for all three cases are:

vt (x; m2) =m2v0(x) +

vv (x; m2) =m2v0(x) +

vs(x; m2) =m2v0(x) +

3(x2 + 2x + 2)
4x(x + 1)2(x + 2)

2x(x + 1)(x + 2)[m2(x + 1) + 3x(x + 2)]

+ vs,

(c.1)

(c.2)

where a rather involved expression has to be added for the scalar potential,

((x + 1)2 + 1)2 + 4x(x + 2)

4x2(x + 2)2

vs = (cid:0)

(cid:1)(cid:16)

24

m4 + 4m2x(x+1)(x+2)(3(x+1)2+7)

(((x+1)2+1)2+4x(x+2))
[m2(x + 1) + 3x(x + 2)]2

(c.3)

(cid:17),

let us briey comment on these eective potentials, v (x; m2) = v (x; m2)+(1/4+)(1/x2),
in various limits,
(a) m2  : for all three eective potentials,

v (x; m2) = m2v0(x) + 0(1).

(c.4)

(b) x  0: in going from v to v , for x  0, we have v (x; m2)  l2/x2 + q/x + 0(1),
where l2 = (l + 1

2 )2 + . those l2 and q values given in eq. (4.19) follow from

vt (x; m2) =

vv (x; m2) =

vs(x; m2) =

x3 + 0(x4),

(c.5)

(c.6)

from these, one concludes that each coulomb bare charge, q, is always screened at large
distance; an eective potential vanishing as 1/x2 at large distance is overall neutral.

appendix d. wkb treatment:

in a standard wkb treatment for a one-dimensional quantum mechanics problem,

one relies on having a small parameter, h, which allows a systematically expansion
hr x dxpe  v (x) +   ]. for a
for the logarithm of the wave-function, (x)  exp[ i
problem involving a spherically symmetric potential, v (x), one has a one-dimensional
radial schroedinger equation involving an eective potential, e.g., eq. (4.7), where v (x) 
vef f (x) = v (x) + l(l + 1)h2/x2. in solving the radial equation, normalizability requires
that the wave-function   xl+1 as x  0+, which also corresponds to our non-singular
boundary condition at the black hole horizon. note that this exact threshold behavior,
(x)  e(l+1) log x, would normally appear only in the next to leading order in a wkb
expansion.

25

u (y)  e2y vef f (x)  x2(cid:0)vef f (x) +

4x2(cid:1) = x2(cid:0)v (x) +

h2

2 )2h2
(l + 1
x2

(cid:1),

it is indeed possible to arrange so that the threshold behavior is properly implemented
in the leading order by working with a rapidity variable, y  log x, where y is now
unrestricted,  < y < , and the radial schroedinger equation becomes (cid:0)  d2/dy2 +
u (y)(cid:1) (y) = e (y), where (y) = e y

2 (x), e  ee2y, and

note that, for u (y) and vef f (x), the combination l(l + 1)h2 has become (l + 1
2 )2h2, which
correlates precisely with the appropriate threshold behavior for   xl+ 1
2 . for an attractive
potential v (x) which is less singular than 1
x2 at the origin, this new eective potential u (y)
2 )2h2 when y  , whose bound state
will have an attractive well, with u (y)  (l + 1
energies can be calculated via a standard wkb approximation. for instance, the leading
dyq e  u (y), where n = 0, 1, 2,   , eyl = xl
order wkb contribution is (n+ 1
and eyr = xr.
returning to our problem; with e  0, and 1/m playing the role of h, we arrive at

2 )h =r yr

yl

i0(m) =

1

mz yr(m)

yl(m)

dypu (y; m).

(d.1)

by changing variable from y back to x, eq. (d.1) can also be written as eq.(4.11) where
where vef f (x; m) enters. let us turn next to the expansion of i0(m) in 1
m , i0(m) 
i0,0 + 1
m2 i0,2 +   . before proceeding, we separate the integral in eq. (d.1) , into
two,

m i0,1 + 1

i0(m) = il(m) + ir(m) =

1

mz 0

yl(m)

dypu (y; m) +

1

mz yr(m)

0

dypu (y; m).

(d.2)

this separation at y = 0 is of course arbitrary; our nal result will be independent of

this choice. it is convenient to separate u (y; m) into two pieces, u (y; m) = m2(cid:0)u0(y) +
m2u1(y; m2)(cid:1), which will be used in eq. (d.2). to expand in 1/m, one needs to know
how u0 and u1 behave as y  .

let us begin by treating the case of tensor modes with reasonable amount of details.
consider il(m) and let us examine the lower integration limit, yl(m). with both   0+
and 1/m  0, the left-turning point is determined by the asymptotic limit of u (y; m2)
as y  , u (y; m2)    (m2/8  3/2)ey. that is, eyl  8
m212 . as   0+, for m
large, it follows that the left-turning point moves to to minus innity, yl  . more

26

explicitly, this is a consequence of the fact that l2
t =   0. we further note that, with
both u0(y) and u1(y) vanish as 0(ey) as y  , the ratio u1(y)/u0(y) remains nite; it
is justied to expand the integrand in m2 and one obtains

il(m) =z 0



dypu0(y) + 0(

m2 ) =z 1

dxpv0(x) + 0(

m2 ).

(d.3)

we turn next to ir(m), which can be more conveniently written as

v1(x; m2)

1
m2

dx

dx

v0(x)  1o (d.4)

x px2v0(x)ns1 +
x px2v0(x) +z xr
ir(m) =z xr
the upper limit is determined by v (xr) = m2(cid:0)v0(xr) + 1
since
v0(x)  1/4x3 and v1(x)  1
x2 , it follows that xr(m)  m2/4. the rst integral
1 dxpv0(x)r 
can be expressed as a dierence: r 
dxpv0(x), where, for 1/m small,
r 
 2/m. for the second integral, the main contribution now
comes from region where x = 0(m2). let us change variable from x to u  x/xr  4x/m2,
mr 1
and, in the limit of large m, this expression becomes 1
m2 ) =
( 2

dxpv0(x)  x1/2

(d.6)

this leads to eq.(4.13) for , and t = 3 for tensor modes.

turning next to the vector modes. again, separating i(m) into two parts, eq. (d.2),

an identical analysis for ir(m) can be carried out as was done for the tensor modes, leading
to the expansion, eq. (d.5). however, since u (y)  1/4 as y  , (corresponding to
the situation where lv = 1/4), eq. (d.3) no longer holds for the vector modes. one nds,
instead,

(d.7)

(d.8)

combining this with that for ir, we have, for vector modes,

this leads to eq. (4.13) for , and v = 4 for vector modes.

we complete this analysis by treating the scalar modes. since l2

t = 0, one
nds that eq. (d.3) holds for scalars modes also. as for ir(m), we need to work with
eq. (d.4) with v (x; m2) = 1/(4x2) + v (x; m2), where v for scalar modes is given by the
rather involved expression in (c.2) and (c.3). let us consider the second integral rst,
where the main contribution now comes from region where x  m2. changing variable
from x to u  x/m2, and, in the limit of large m, this expression becomes

s = l2

can be expressed as a dierence: r

dxpv0(x)  1/(mur). combining these with that for il, we have
