wrapped membranes.

we investigate nonperturbative eects in m -theory compactications arising from
in particular, we show that in d = 4, n = 1 compactications
along manifolds of g2 holonomy, membranes wrapped on rigid supersymmetric 3-cycles
induce nonzero corrections to the superpotential. thus, membrane instantons destabilize

many m -theory compactications. our computation shows that the low energy description

of membrane physics is usefully described in terms of three-dimensional topological eld

theories, and the superpotential is expressed in terms of topological invariants of the 3-

cycle. we discuss briey some applications of these results. for example, using mirror

symmetry we derive a counting formula for supersymmetric three-cycles in certain calabi-

yau manifolds.

1. introduction

the importance of instanton computations in string theory and in m-theory can hardly

be overstated. to cite but one reason, the understanding of instanton eects is a neces-

sary ingredient in attempts to make realistic m/string theory models which address the

problems of vacuum selection and supersymmetry breaking.

compared to instantons in gauge theory and string theory, m -brane instantons have

not been so thoroughly discussed. these eects were rst discussed in the fundamental pa-

per of becker, becker, and strominger [1]. there has been some work on non-perturbative

corrections in compactications of m -theory with 4 unbroken supersymmetries beginning

with wittens investigation of ve-brane instantons [2]. since m 2 branes can sometimes

be interpreted in terms of world-sheet instantons in iia string theory (see, e.g.

[1][3][4])

a fair amount is known in this case. nevertheless, we believe that much remains to be

understood concerning the general computation of m -brane instantons, and this paper is

a modest step in that direction.

specically, in the present paper we discuss instanton eects associated with wrapped

m 2 branes in m theory compactications to three and four dimensions. throughout most

of the paper we focus on the example of m -theory compactication on smooth seven-

manifolds of g2 holonomy (henceforth abbreviated as g2-manifolds). we will show that in
such compactications membrane instantons can induce a nonzero superpotential. as an

example, rigid membranes lead to a contribution to the superpotential given in equations

(2.13) and (6.10) below.

here is a brief overview of the paper. in section 2 we review a few aspects of kaluza-

klein reduction of 11-dimensional supergravity on g2 manifolds. in section 3 we complain
about the absence of a clear set of rules for computing m -brane instanton eects (due to

the want of a fundamental formulation of m -theory), and outline the practical procedure

we will adopt.

in sections 4 and 5 we consider the low energy action of a membrane in curved su-

perspace. the upshot of our discussion is that the low energy uctuations of a mem-

brane wrapped on a supersymmetric 3-cycle are usefully thought of in terms of certain

three-dimensional topological eld theories.
it is well-known that in string theory two-
dimensional topological sigma models (the a and b models, and their couplings to
topological gravity) are quite relevant to the computation of superpotentials [5][6]. not sur-

prisingly, we are nding that in m -theory an analogous role is played by three-dimensional

topological eld theory.

section 6 contains the key results of the paper. we derive (following the provisional

rules of section 3) the contribution to the superpotential from a rigid membrane instanton,

and derive one-loop determinants and zeromodes needed in the more general case of arbi-

trary membrane instantons. we discuss briey the relation of the phase of the instanton

contribution to the one-loop determinants, following a similar discussion by witten in the

example of d1-brane instantons [7].

in the remainder of the paper we turn to examples and applications of our results. in

section 7 we discuss a simple class of g2 manifolds and show that there do exist examples
of the kinds of eects we have discussed. (we also give a relevant example in appendix

c.) section 8 contains some brief comments on the extension of this work to compacti-

cations of iia string theory on g2 manifolds. section 9 concerns generating functions
counting supersymmetric 3-cycles in calabi-yau 3-folds admitting a real structure. section

10 examines consequences for nonperturbative eects in the heterotic string. section 11

addresses some eects of open membrane instantons. many conventions and notations can

be found in appendices a and b.

some closely related issues to those discussed in this paper have been addressed by

b.s. acharya in [8]. acharya focuses on certain interesting singular g2 manifolds. in the
present paper we usually work with the case of smooth g2 manifolds.

2. compactication on g2 manifolds

the low energy limit of m -theory is described by 11-dimensional supergravity. this

theory consists of a metric g, a 3-form c, and a gravitino , dened on an eleven-

dimensional lorentzian spin manifold m11. the bosonic action enters the path integral
through 1

where  is the eleven-dimensional planck length and g = dc. the ellipsis indicates the

presence of higher order terms in the low energy expansion. these will be ignored in what

follows. the eld strength g is normalized by requiring that

where the integral is taken around a 4-sphere linking the basic ve-brane in ir1,10.

in this paper m11 will be taken to be smooth, and all relevant lengthscales are large
compared to . moreover, we focus on vacua with smooth ricci at direct product metrics:

m11 = m4  x

g(x, y) = g(x)dxdx + gmn(y)dymdyn

(2.3)

(0  ,   3, 1  m, n  7.) we take x to be a manifold of g2 holonomy. in particular
we assume x has a covariantly constant spinor m = 0, unique up to scale. thus,
compactication on x leads to a theory with d = 4, n = 1 supersymmetry. when we
work in euclidean signature we will take m4 to be a hyperkahler manifold.

we complete the specication of the background by taking the background value of

c to be a real harmonic 3-form on x, and thus g = dc = 0. 2

the kaluza-klein reduction of m -theory on x is completely straightforward. the

eld multiplets were worked out in [10]. the massless multiplets consist of the supergravity
multiplet (g, ), chiral multiplets (zi, i), i = 1, . . . , b3(x), and u (1) vector multiplets
(i , ai

), i = 1, . . . , b2(x).

the above multiplets may be derived as follows. the u (1) gauge elds are obtained
i }i=1,...,b2(x) for h2(x; zz)

from the 3-form c. choosing a basis of harmonic forms {(2)
and a basis {(3)

i }i=1,...,b3(x) for h3(x; zz) we write the kaluza-klein ansatz

c =

b2(x)

xi=1

ai (x)  (2)

i (y) + 3

b3(x)

xi=1

p i(x)(3)

i

(y)

(2.5)

where the p i are pseudo-scalars. using the normalization (2.2) large gauge transformations
form a maximal rank discrete subgroup of 2h2(x; zz). thus the gauge group is a nite
cover of the torus h 2(x; ir)/(2h 2(x; zz)).

2 we are ignoring an important subtlety here. the following remarks were explained to us by
e. witten. in compactications of m theory on x the quantization condition is shifted [9] and

becomes the statement that

h g
2i 


2

 h 4(x, zz)

(2.4)

where [g/2] is the cohomology class of g/2 and (x) = p1(x)/2. for a g2-manifold  is

always even, so that it is consistent to set g = 0. the argument is the following: note that
p1(x) = p1(x  s1). now x  s1 is an eight-dimensional spin manifold and  is even or odd on
an eight-dimensional spin manifold according to whether the intersection form is even or odd [9].
now observe that the intersection form of x  s1 is obviously even.

3

let us now consider the chiral multiplets. using the covariantly constant spinor one
can construct a g2 calibration, i.e., a covariantly constant 3-form: mnp = mnp. in
an appropriate local orthonormal frame the components of  are the structure constants of

the octonions o. conversely, such a covariantly constant 3-form can be used to characterize
the g2 structure [11]. 3 we may thus dene real scalar elds si(x) by choosing a base
point g2 structure 0 and associating the g2 metric to a torsion free calibration

(2.6)

by straightforward reduction of the supergravity action (described below) one nds
that the kahler target space has holomorphic tangent space t 1,0m = h 3(x; ir) 
h 3(x; ir), with the obvious complex structure. the holomorphic coordinates on this

space are given by

c + i3 = i0 + 3

(2.7)

with zi = p i + isi. this is the analog for g2 manifolds of the complexied kahler class
familiar from string compactication on calabi-yau 3-folds. holomorphy in c + i3 will

play an important role in the discussion below.

the kaluza-klein expansion of the gravitino is

now let us consider the low energy eective action. the eective action at the two-
derivative order is determined by a choice of a kahler target space m for the chiral scalars
zi, a holomorphic gauge kinetic function ij (z), and a holomorphic superpotential w (z).

harmonic forms on x transform in the 14 of the holonomy group and therefore satisfy

. it follows that imij is denite when x is smooth5.

i

the kahler potential can be deduced by looking at the kinetic terms of the scalars

p i. using identities similar to the calabi-yau case one obtains:

where g0 corresponds to the basepoint 0. we have chosen the additive constant in k so

(2.11)

k =  log(cid:20) rx det g
rx det g0(cid:21)
that the 4d newton constant is 9/(4rx det g0).

the superpotential is zero in the low energy supergravity approximation. this is

proved using an argument analogous to that in [5]. as shown in [15,16] the superpotential
w is a global holomorphic section of a negative hermitian line bundle l  m with

c1(l) = 

i

  log k w k2:= 

i
2

  log ek|w|2.

(2.12)

in the absence of membrane instantons there is a continuous peccei-quinn symmetry c 
c + ,   h3(m11; ir). on the other hand, the overall volume vol(x) is equal to
7r   , so the energy expansion is an expansion in inverse powers of im(c + i3).

now we use holomorphy of w to conclude that there are no corrections.

1

on the other hand, membrane instantons from euclidean m2 branes wrapping 3-cycles
  x violate the pq symmetry, breaking it to some discrete subgroup of h3(m11; zz).
thus membrane instantons can induce a superpotential. we will show that indeed the

contribution to the superpotential of a rigid supersymmetric rational homology sphere in

the g2 manifold is

w  |h1(x; zz)| exp[iz

(c + i)]

(2.13)

5 again, the subtlety mentioned in footnote 2 above is important at this point. the axion terms
associated with c are only really well-dened when combined with the one-loop rarita-schwinger

determinant, as in [9].

5

the proportionality constant (independent of c,  ) is positive and associated with

bulk supergravity determinants. a more precise result for this constant awaits the solution

of some conceptual problems described in the next section.

we should also worry about 5-brane instanton eects. in [12] (ii. proposition 1.1.1)

joyce shows that 1(x) (and hence h6(x; zz) ) is nite if the holonomy is all of g2. if the

holonomy group is smaller the group h6(x; zz) might or might not be nite. even when

it is nite there might be interesting eects. however, generically, there will be no 5-brane

instantons.

3. on the rules for computing membrane instanton eects

3.1. divertimento

6

salviati: sagredo! when are we going to write that paper on membrane instantons!?

basta! basta!

sagredo: salviati! how can we write a paper on m-theory instantons when we dont

understand the fundamental formulation of m-theory?!

salviati: piano, piano. look. we have now learned the lesson of p-brane democracy. m -

theory is a theory of fundamental m2-branes, or, by duality, a theory of fundamental m5-

branes. eleven-dimensional supergravity is just a collective excitation, as in string theory.

indeed, if we study the membrane solution in supergravity we nd a timelike singularity in

the metric! thus, as for the string solution of ten-dimensional supergravity, the membrane

is fundamental. therefore, we simply need to follow the obvious generalization of the

rules of string theory and reduce the computation of fermion bilinears in spacetime to a

computation of the correlation function of vertex operators in the m2-brane theory. the

gravitino vertex operator has even been computed for us in [1].

sagredo: no. i cannot agree. there is no obvious generalization of the rules of string

theory. no one has found the graviton by quantizing membranes. on the other hand,

matrix theory is a proposal for a fundamental formulation. furthermore, in matrix theory

the m2-brane is a collective excitation composed of d0-branes. so lets do the computation

directly in matrix theory!

6 with apologies to s. coleman, and g. galilei.

6

salviati: for membranes wrapped on supersymmetric cycles in g2 manifolds...? prego:
to appear or in preparation ?

sagredo: o.k. perhaps this is not necessary. still, membranes are not fundamental, but

simply collective excitations of some fundamental degrees of freedom in some fundamental

formulation of m theory. the best we can do is take the supergravity soliton description

seriously and think of the membrane modes as collective coordinates in the solitonic de-

scription. the computation of membrane instantons indeed involves a path integral of a 3d

eld theory, but this should simply be regarded as an integral over collective coordinates.

after all, the saddle point technique is just a way of reducing the number of integrals you

have to do, and we are doing nothing more than a saddle point approximation to the path

integral for m -theory (if that is even the right formulation). the determinants of the

saddle-point approximation are just the 11d supergravity determinants in the membrane

solution background.

salviati: alas, sagredo, i fear you have erred in two ways. first, recall that in t hoofts

calculation of instanton eects in yang-mills theory the space of collective coordinates is

nite dimensional, and the action is constant on this space of collective coordinates. do

you really want to identify all of the superembeddings (x(s), (s)) of the membrane as

collective coordinates? this cannot be, for the action is not constant on this space. second,

the singularity in the membrane metric makes the supergravity determinants you propose

to calculate ill-dened. one needs to specify boundary conditions in a second asymptotic

regime: how do you propose to choose them!?

sagredo: what you say sounds correct. of course (x(s), (s)) are not collective coordi-

nates. nevertheless, for small derivatives sx they do describe low-energy excitations of
the membrane. there are, after all, several scales in our problem: that of the 4d eective

theory, 4d, that of the kaluza-klein compactication kk, in addition to the 11d planck
scale . in the domain   kk  4d the data of the uv degrees of freedom needed to
make sense of the supergravity solution are summarized at long distances by the embed-

ding coordinates (x(s), (s)). if we only consider the modes of the 11d gravitino  at
scales 4d then there is a clear distinction between | and (s). this coupling of degrees
of freedom from dierent scales is summarized by the bst supermembrane action.

salviati: allora, non c`e niente altro da fare. what other formalism could we use besides

that advocated by bbs in [1]? so, you suggest we follow the copenhagen interpretation?

sagredo: which is?

salviati: shut up and calculate!

sagredo: si! andiamo!

7

3.2. the procedure in this paper

unfortunately, the authors of this paper are just as confused as the tuscan twosome.

the rules for computing brane-instanton eects have not been clearly formulated. indeed,

upon reection one nds many unanswered and vexing conceptual issues. these issues

become important when one attempts to compute sub-leading eects in an instanton sector.

in this note we take a practical approach to the problem and follow the procedure

implicitly followed in the original paper of becker, becker, and strominger [1]. as in,

for example, the calculations of [17,18], we will extract the eective superpotential by

computing instanton-induced fermion bilinears and then comparing to the fermion bilinears

in the low energy eective supergravity action. the latter are given by [19,16]

ek/2w   +

ek/2(diw )gij(jij )i j
ek/2(cid:0)didjw(cid:1)ij + ek/2(diw ) i + cplxconj.

(3.1)

where di is the metric covariant derivative for both m and l.

in an instanton sector an m 2 brane wraps a 3-cycle   m11. the low energy
eective theory of the membrane is a three-dimensional eld theory with degrees of freedom
described by a super-embedding: z : 3|0  m 11|32. here 3|0 is the oriented brane world-
volume, and m 11|32 is eleven-dimensional space-time, thought of as super-manifolds. the

target space is equipped with an on-shell supergravity background.

following [1] we formulate correlators in an instanton sector as follows. if we wish

to compute the 2-point function of generic four-dimensional spacetime fermions f1, f2 at

positions x1, x2 then we must compute a path integral within a path integral:

(cid:10)f1(x1)f2(x2)(cid:11) :=z [dg (x)d(x)dzidid(x)da(x)]es4dsugra
 f1(x1)f2(x2) z [dz(s)]esm 2[z(s);g,c,].

(3.2)

the rst path integral is that of the eective four-dimensional supergravity described

above. the second path integral is that of a three-dimensional eld theory on the m 2-

brane, described below. the m 2 brane couples to the background elds g, c,  of 11d

supergravity, and we substitute the kaluza-klein ansatz. while the above procedure

surely receives many corrections when computing generic correlation functions, it might

well be exact for the special correlators that determine the superpotential. it would be

8

highly desirable to have a rmer foundation for brane-instanton computations in m-theory.

nevertheless, we maintain our practical attitude and continue.

 to the brane through the gravitino vertex operator  r

as in [1] the amplitude (3.2) is evaluated by contracting f1, f2 with the coupling of
v . the contractions of
f1, f2 with  are carried out by rst substituting the kaluza-klein reduction (2.8). the
fermion propagators are then amputated, as in [18]. we are then left with the computation
of the two-point function hv (s1)v (s2)i of the gravitino vertex operator in the three-
dimensional membrane theory. 7

in order to contribute to the superpotential the membrane instanton must leave at

least two fermion zero-modes unbroken. in the following we will evaluate the contribution

in the case when there are exactly two fermion zero-modes. the possible contribution of

congurations with more fermion zero-modes is left for future work. in order to examine

the fermion zero-modes, and compute determinants we need to understand in detail the

expansion of the membrane lagrangian in curved spaces. we describe this in the next

section.

4. eective actions for m2 branes in curved spaces

as above, we regard an m 2-brane as a dynamical object described by a super-

embedding z : 3|0  m 11|32. separating bosonic and fermionic coordinates we have

zm(s) =(cid:0)x m (s), (s)(cid:1)

(4.1)

where (s)  (cid:2)s(t m11)|(cid:3) is a section of a pulled-back spinor bundle. these degrees of

freedom are governed by the super-membrane action of bergshoe, sezgin, and townsend

[20]. in euclidean signature the action enters the path integral through

7 actually, there are also 2 interactions in the expansion of sm 2 in powers of . these in
fact do contribute to fermion bilinears and are important in sorting out contact terms. these

(important!) subtleties will not be discussed in the present paper.

9

the sign of the wz term depends on the orientation of .

the action (4.2) has bosonic and fermionic gauge invariances, di()  di, where
di  refers to -supersymmetry [20]. the induced metric for any embedding of  gives
an orthogonal decomposition t m11| = t   n in terms of tangent and normal bundles.
this leads to a reduction of the structure group spin(1, 10)  spin(1, 2)k  spin(8)
under which 32ir = (2; 8)  (2; 8+). therefore the spinor bundles can be reduced as

s(t m11)| = s(t )  s(n )  s(t )  s+(n ).

(4.4)

in this language, the meaning of -supersymmetry is that the physical degrees of freedom
are in s(t )  s(n ). hence, after xing static gauge the physical degrees of freedom
are given by

y  [n  ]
  [s(t )  s(n )]

(4.5)

where n is the normal bundle to  in the full eleven-dimensional space-time, and s(n )
is the negative chirality spinor bundle associated to n .

in order to describe the action for the physical degrees of freedom in a way useful for

our purposes we need to expand the action in powers of y(s), (s). let us rst focus on
the purely bosonic action. choose a local coordinate system x m = (xm
is described by the equation ym

= 0. in general we will denote tangent indices with a

) so that 

, ym

prime and normal indices with a double-prime. we choose coordinates so that the metric
tensor on (t m11)| is of the form

g| =(cid:18) hmn (x)

0

0

hmn (x)(cid:19) .

(4.6)

expanding the induced area we obtain the standard result that the area is stationary if  is

a minimal sub-manifold, i.e., if the trace of the second fundamental form is zero. choosing
static gauge xm

we nd that the expansion around a minimal sub-manifold

(s) = si m

is:

where d is the induced connection on the normal bundle, qmnl is the second fundamental

kml is the ambient curvature tensor restricted to the brane.

to obtain the action for the fermions we expand the on-shell supergravity background

in powers of the super-coordinate . the torsion constraints for 11d on shell super-space
were found in [21]. the frame to order  including the gravitino but putting gabcd| =

we now consider the expansion of (4.2) in uctuations around y =  = 0. treating

(4.13)

8 after working out these superspace expansions we learned of the paper [22] which also
works out the frame to order 2. the conventions are dierent but up to numerical coecients
our expressions agree, at least up to order o(2). see also [23].

let us now consider the supersymmetries of the action. these will be quite useful in

sorting out topological eld theories in the next section. the unbroken super-isometries

of the on-shell 11d background become global supersymmetries of the m2 theory. the

where  is a covariantly constant spinor for the bosonic ( = 0) background. thus, includ-

ing the gauge transformations, the action is invariant under the following transformations:

(s) =  + () +  + vi(s)i + o(4)

x m (s) = i m  + (km )  i m  + vi(s)ix m + o(3)
 :=(1 + k[x, ])(s)

is the induced cliord volume element. one easily shows that k[x, ]2 =  det g
working in minkowskian signature 1

| det g| , so,
2 (1 + k) is a projector. to see how these trans-
formations act on physical degrees of freedom we x di() symmetry by choosing

static gauge. then, to x  supersymmetry we choose a decomposition of spinors un-
der spin(1, 10)  spin(1, 2)  spin(8) such that 32 = (2, 8)  (2, 8+). we choose a
representation of the cliord algebra, and spinor conventions as in appendix a. in this

representation the spinor degrees of freedom may be written as:

 =(cid:18) aa
2 (cid:19) .

for the conguration y =  = 0 the induced cliord volume is

k[y = 0,  = 0] = 12 (cid:18)18

18(cid:19)

so we x the gauge by taking:

 =(cid:18) aa(s)

(cid:19) .

(4.20)

(4.21)

in order to get something useful from (4.18) we introduce the low energy expansion

which is an expansion in degrees dened by:

] = 1, [1] =
1/2.
(note that this diers from the energy expansion in bulk supergravity, where
[] has weight 1/2.) the way in which we assign degrees to the geometrical objects
m ], [ab
[e a
si . if
some set of normal directions has a direct product structure then we can consistently as-

m ], [rm np q] requires discussion. in general we must assign degree one to 

[si] = 1, [ym

] = 0, [iym

sign degree zero to [e], [], [r] in those normal directions. however, if there are o-diagonal

terms in the metric, e.g. second fundamental forms or connections on the normal bundle,
then we must assign degree one to [ab

m ], [rm np q].

we now decompose the covariantly constant spinor in terms of spin(8) chirality as in

(4.20):

 =(cid:18) aa
2 (cid:19)

1
a a

(4.22)

the spinors 1 and 2 generate a broken and an unbroken supersymmetry in the membrane
theory, respectively. we consider the supersymmetry parameter to have degree +1/2.

13

then, the degree expansion of the broken 1, and unbroken 2 supersymmetries takes the
form

1 = [1]0 + [1]+2 +   
2 = [2]+1 + [2]+2 +   

where the superscript denotes the change in degree. explicitly, the broken supersymmetry

(4.23)

(4.25)

is given by

(4.26)

the extra terms in (4.25) are related to second fundamental forms and connections on the

normal bundle. they do not occur in the usual treatment of supersymmetric sigma models

because the metric on the world-volume and the metric in target space is a product metric

in the standard sigma model.

5. membranes in a g2 manifold

we now consider manifolds of the form m4x where m4 is hyperkahler and x has g2
holonomy. in order to induce a superpotential the brane instanton should leave at least 2
unbroken supersymmetries. a cycle   x such that x has a covariantly constant spinor
 with (1 + k[x,  = 0]) = 0 is a supersymmetric cycle [1]. a key result of [1][24] is
that such cycles are the calibrated sub-manifolds of harvey and lawson [25]. therefore,

14

we specialize to the case of an associative 3-fold  in x. under these circumstances the

formulae of the previous section simplify considerably.

we begin this simplication by noting that in the above circumstances there is a

reduction of the normal bundle structure group

spin(8)  spin(4)1,2,3,4  spin(4)1,2,3,4

under this reduction the general spin(8) spinor can be written as

 = (() y

 , (++)

 ; (+) y , (+) y )
y

(5.1)

(5.2)

where the +,  refers to the chiralities in the rst and second spin(4) factors. in this nota-
tion, after we x -symmetry, and restore the spin(1, 2) spinor index a for the structure
group of the spinor bundle s(t ), we get the gauge xed spinor degree of freedom:

 = (() ay



, (++)

y

a; 0, 0)

(5.3)

now we must review a few consequences of g2 holonomy, in down-to-earth terms. on
a g2 manifold the spin(7) structure group of the tangent bundle is reduced to g2. we
choose an identication

where in a local orthonormal frame e1,2,...,7 for t x we have

(, t x) = (0, ir7 = o)

0 = e123 + e145 + e176 + e246 + e257 + e347 + e653.

(5.4)

(5.5)

we may identify the spin representation of spin(7) with the octonions o. these, in turn, are

identied with pairs of quaternions [26]. along an associative 3-fold we have a covariantly
constant identication of ts  tsx, s  , with (imh, 0)  imo. the structure group
of t  has spin indices a, b, . . . , = 1, 2 while that of the normal bundle has su (2) su (2)
spin indices y, y , respectively. the corresponding spin bundles are denoted e. the spin
connection on x, restricted to , may be written as

 =(cid:18) (k)ab
ba

ab

()ab(cid:19)

(5.6)

where a, b = 1, 2, 3 are tangent frame indices and a, b = 4, 5, 6, 7 are normal bundle

orthonormal frame indices. this corresponds to the decomposition of the adjoint of so(7)

15

under the so(3)k  so(4) subgroups. the adjoint of so(4) can be further decomposed in
terms of its self-dual and antiselfdual parts with spinor indices (+) y
y  . sim-
ilarly, the o-diagonal connection has spinor indices () y y ab symmetric in ab. writing
a spinor of spin(7) as

y  and ()y

 = (()a

y , (+)

y

a)

(5.7)

(regarded as a pair of quaternions) the covariantly constant spinor is  = (a
out the covariant constancy condition m = 0 we nd the spin connection satises

y , 0). writing

and

(k)a

y  ()a

y = 0

y y



y a = 0,

(5.8)

(5.9)

that is, () y y ab is totally symmetric in the undotted indices. the connection + is
unconstrained. these equations describe the decomposition of the adjoint 14 of g2 
spin(7) under the so(3)  so(4) subgroup of spin(7).

the condition (5.8) is very important and is one concrete way to understand the

connection of brane actions to topological eld theory, (this was predicted in [27] based on

r-symmetry considerations.) the identication of connections for the tangent bundle k
and the normal bundle,  (with r-symmetry structure group) is a standard approach

to formulating the procedure of topological twisting [28]. (see [29,30,31] for reviews.)

it follows from (5.8) that the g2 structure allows us to identify the spin groups trans-

forming the indices a and y . thus we may may trade in the fermions

()ay

 = ay + j(i j)ay

(5.10)

for zero-forms  and 1-forms  on , as is familiar in topological eld theory. (these still

carry an index  since they are spinors on m4.) moreover, again because of (5.8), the
normal bundle directions for motion of  within x, y m, can be written as a bispinor ya y ,
that is, as sections of s(t ) e+. thus, the physical degrees of freedom of the m 2 brane
naturally split into two multiplets reecting the reduction of the structure group (5.1).

the rst multiplet, whose bosonic degrees of freedom describe normal motion in m4 is

(y , , j)

16

(5.11)

we call this the rozansky-witten multiplet (or just the rw multiplet). denoting  y
(++) y

a the second multiplet is (ya y ,  y

a ). we call this the mclean multiplet.

a =

we will now explain why these names are appropriate. because of the g2 holonomy,

the covariantly constant spinor on m4  x must have the form:

 = (1; 2) = (

 ay , 0;  

+ay , 0)

(5.12)

 ,  

where 
+ are negative and positive chirality covariantly constant spinors on the hy-
perkahler manifold m4, respectively. as in the previous section, these give linear and
nonlinear supersymmetries.

under the nonlinear supersymmetry all elds transform to zero except  = 
 .

under the linear supersymmetry the rw multiplet transforms as:

y  = 2i


+

+  (y m)( m) 
while from (4.25) we nd the mclean multiplet transforms as:


 = (iy) 

()ay

 ()ay


ya y = i a y + 
 a y = ( /dy)a y + .

(5.13)

(5.14)

the transformations (5.13) are just the transformations of rozansky and witten [32].
9 moreover, from the second line of (5.14) we immediately recover the fact that the tangent
space to the moduli of associative threefolds at  is identied with the space of zero-modes

of the twisted dirac operator. this is theorem 5.2 of [33].

the quadratic action likewise splits up as a sum for the rozansky-witten and mclean

multiplets. the action for the rw multiplet is [32]:

z

dy   dy  + (cid:0)  d +   d(cid:1) + r     +   

(5.15)

where r is the self-dual part of the curvature, and we have not been careful about
numerical coecients. we have only shown terms up to degree 2. although we only worked

out the quadratic action in (4.14), invariance under (5.13) requires the curvature term.

similarly, the quadratic uctuations for the mclean multiplet are given by:

z [( /de+y)2 +  /de+  +   ]

(5.16)

9 equation 2.18 in [32] has a misprint.

17

here /de+ is the dirac operator twisted by e+ (and again, we have not been careful about
numerical coecients). the bosonic terms in the action correspond to theorem 5.3 of [33].

it follows from (4.23) that the higher order terms in (5.16) are of degree 3.

it is interesting to note what happens when we specialize the holonomy of x further
and take x = z  s1 where z is a calabi-yau 3-fold and   z is a special lagrangian
submanifold. then the spin(4) structure group of n (  x) is reduced to the spin(3)
structure group of n (  z). the group spin(3) = su (2) is embedded diagonally in
spin(4) so we have another identication of connections + = . we can therefore

introduce a topological twisting of the mclean multiplet

 a y =  a y +  

j (i j)a y .

(5.17)

the rst order deformations of  in z are now given by zeromodes   h1(; ir). in
this way we can reproduce mcleans theorem 3-6 on deformations of special lagrangian

submanifolds of z [33].

6. computation of the superpotential

6.1. zeromodes and determinants

in this section we compute the contributions from m2 instantons to the superpotential
for g2 compactication for the choice m4 = ir4. we have seen that at degree 2 the m2
theory is a product of a theory for the rw multiplet and for the mclean multiplet. we

now describe the zeromodes and one-loop determinants for these multiplets.

the zero-modes in the path integral for the rw multiplet are: (1.) the constant

scalars y (s) = y 
ir4. (2.) the 2 constant fermion zero-mode partners (s) = 

0 . these simply correspond to the position of the susy 3-cycle in
0 . (3.) harmonic 1-form

zero-modes for . there are b1() such linearly independent zero-modes.

as discussed in [32] the path integral is a measure on the space of zero-modes
max(2h0(; ir))  max(h1(; ir)). the measure is the product of the natural mea-
sure given by the metric with the -regularized determinants. as discussed in [32] the

path integral takes the form

det l
(det 0)2

18

(6.1)

where (0) is the laplacian on scalars and l is an operator appearing in chern-simons
perturbation theory [34]. the absolute value of the determinants is the ray-singer torsion.

the phase is more subtle and is discussed below.

we now turn to the mclean multiplet. the path integral gives a measure on the space
of zero-modes [dya y
0 d0] and therefore gives a measure on the moduli space of supersym-
metric 3-cycles deformable to . in this case the quadratic uctuation determinant is just

the phase of the dirac determinant

det( /de+ )

again this phase is subtle, and discussed below.

qdet /d

/de+

e+

.

(6.2)

let us now specialize to s which are rigid and topologically rational homology

spheres. then the measure becomes

z dy 

0 d

0 |h1(; zz)|ei(,n ) exp[iz

(c + i3vol(h))]

(6.3)

here we have used the standard result that the ray-singer torsion of a rational homology
sphere is just the order of the nite group h1(; zz) [32]. here ei(,n ) is the phase from
the fermion determinants.

6.2. the phase of the one-loop measure

the phase of the dirac determinant coupled to a vector bundle in an odd-dimensional

space-time is discussed in [35,36,37,38,39]. one of the standard approaches to the subject

is to use a pauli-villars regulator. this leads to the result

det /de
| det /de|

= exp[

i
2

( /de)]

(6.4)

where  is the atiyah-patodi-singer (aps) invariant. the sign in the exponent depends

on the choice of sign of the mass of a pauli-villars regulator.

if we use this result in the present problem then we encounter a problem. the resulting

expression for the superpotential violates holomorphy of w as a function of c +i, because

the -invariants such as (6.4) are nontrivial functions of the g2 structure, but are not
functions of c. one can approach this problem by adding local chern-simons terms in

 to cancel the holomorphy anomaly, but then one runs into thorny issues related to
correctly dening the chern-simons terms (which have half-integer coecients). a better

19

way to dene the phase of the one loop determinants has been described by witten in [7]

in the case of d1 instantons. his method is easily adapted to our problem.

quite generally, when considering membrane instantons we have a closed oriented

three-manifold  in an oriented, spin, 11-manifold m11 with ricci at metric g and real
rank 32 spin bundle s(t m11). restricing s(t m11) to  we have the splitting (4.4).
consider the dirac operator /d on  coupled to the induced connection on s(t )s(n )
from the ambient metric g. the phase of the membrane determinant involves

pfa( /ds(n)) exp[iz

(c + i)]

(6.5)

as stressed in [9][7], because of the subtle geometrical nature of the eld c, neither factor

in (6.5) is separately well-dened, in general. the fermion determinant is not well-dened

because of global anomalies. nevertheless, the product is well-dened. (in the example of

a g2 manifold each factor is well-dened, but not canonically so. )

let use choose a basis of cycles i for h3(x; zz). then the phases eii for the expres-
sion (6.5) evaluated for the cycles i constitutes part of the data determining the m -theory
background. once this data has been specied the phases of all other membrane instantons
can be expressed in terms of eii . to see this consider an arbitrary sum of cycles i trivial

in homology, that is, such that there is an open 4-manifold such that p[i] = m4. by a
natural extension of the result of [40] there should be a canonical trivialization of the the
pfaan line bundles t : ipfaff( /ds(n),i )  ir. then the phase of the product of
the determinants for i is that of

t(cid:20)ipfa( /ds(n),i )(cid:21) exp[izm4

g]

(6.6)

and the expression (6.6) may be shown to be independent of the choice of cobordism m4.
the upshot of this discussion is that, if we are willing to ignore the correct geometrical
status of c then we can absorb the phase ei(,n ) in (6.3) into the denition of the object

exp[ir c].

6.3. computing w

let us now turn to the computation of the fermion two-point functions in the four-

dimensional eective action. the computation of gaugino and gravitino mass terms is

tricky because of contact terms. the cleanest term to evaluate is the part of the chiral mul-
tiplet mass term proportional to ijw . computing the two-point function hi(x1)j(x2)i

20

for |x1  x2|   using the instanton approximation in (3.2) we nd (after truncating the
fermion propagators) the mass term:

dsugra



ijvivj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

here dsugra
further below. we also have:



det l

(det (0))2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
vi = 4z

stand for the 11d bulk supergravity determinants of g, c,  are are discussed

exp[iz

(c + i3vol(h))]

(6.7)

(3)
i

(6.8)

and we have taken the harmonic three-forms (3)
again to avoid subtleties with contact terms.

i

to be in the 27 representation of g2,

this computation shows that a rigid rational homology 3-sphere gives a contribution

to the superpotential of:

w  dsugra



|h1(; zz)| exp[iz

(c + i3)]

(6.9)

where we have used the fact that | = vol(h) for an associative 3-cycle. we only write 
because we have not been careful about the overall normalization of the kahler potential.

(this will involve a purely numerical factor with powers of 2 and .) note that, since we

are working in a green-schwarz-like formalism we do not sum over spin structures on .

rather, the spin structure on  is induced by that of the ambient supergravity background.

when we consider the supergravity determinants dsugra



we run into some of the

conceptual problems discussed in section three. if we treat the membrane as an elementary
brane in the g2 manifold ir4  x7 with no account of backreaction then we can simply
take dsugra
to be a constant, independent of . therefore, if we treat the membrane
as an elementary membrane in a smooth supergravity background, then we can choose



an additive constant in the kahler potential so that rigid membranes contribute to the

superpotential

w = |h1(; zz)| exp[iz

(c + i3)].

(6.10)

6.4. further development

an important check on (6.9) will be the computation of other terms in (3.1). these

other terms will be more dicult to compute because of contact terms. (for example, the

gravitino mass term is entirely due to contact terms.)

21

the above discussion should also be extended to the case of supersymmetric 3-cycles

with b1() > 0 and to non-rigid supersymmetric 3-cycles. since wrapped membrane
instantons can sometimes be related to worldsheet instantons it is clear that in general

nonisolated membranes can contribute to nonperturbative eects. it is quite likely that

higher order interactions from the expansion of the dbi action can come down from the

exponential and soak up the extra zero-modes. we expect that this will occur already at

degree three in the low energy expansion.

finally, one needs to address the issue of a multiple-cover formula. we give an example

below which shows that in general there must be contributions from such multiple covers.

based on the known multiple-cover formula for the contribution of worldsheet instantons
one may guess that a k-fold covering membrane enters as m(k, b1())ekvol(), where m
is a universal function, but we do not have much evidence for this.

7. examples with rigid supersymmetric 3-cycles

in this section we give an example of a class of compactications in which one can

show that the eects we have discussed above really exist.

7.1. barely g2 manifolds and their moduli

we now focus on a very special class of g2 manifolds which we call barely g2 manifolds.

10 these are, by denition, g2 manifolds of the form:

x = (z  s1)/zz2

(7.1)

here z is a calabi-yau 3-fold. zz2 acts by (z, 1). z is a real structure, by which we
mean an anti-holomorphic involutive isometry of the calabi-yau metric taking


z(j) = j
z() = + .


(7.2)

we will take z to act without xed points so x is smooth. for generic holonomy of z
the holonomy is merely su (3)  zz2. nevertheless, there is only one covariantly constant
spinor, so for many physical purposes x is a genuine g2 manifold. examples of smooth
barely g2 manifolds may be easily constructed from complete intersection calabi-yau

10 these manifolds are discussed briey in [12].

22

manifolds in weighted projective spaces dened by polynomials with real coecients. the

case where z does have xed points can presumably be smoothed, as discussed in [12].
in such manifolds, some of the following considerations will still apply.

the cohomology of barely g2 manifolds is easily computed in terms of that of z :

h 3(x; ir) = h 2(z; ir)  h 3(z; ir)+

(7.3)

where the superscripts denote the  eigenspaces under the action of 
z. now suppose that
z is a calabi-yau obtained from a hypersurface of a toric variety. then h 2(z; ir) can be

interpreted as the space of kahler deformations inherited from the ambient quasi-projective
spaces, while h 3(z; ir)+ may be identied with the complex structure deformations pre-

serving the real structure. thus, we expect that the calabi-yaus with anti-holomorphic
involution 
z form a real sub-manifold of m2,1m1,1, of real dimension h2,1(z)+h1,1(z),

mir

2,1  mir

1,1  m2,1  m1,1.

(7.4)

indeed we expect (7.4) to be a natural lagrangian sub-manifold of the full cy moduli
m2,1  m1,1 ( very much in the spirit of the discussion in [41]).

we can describe the moduli space of barely g2 manifolds. for g2 manifolds the
tangent to moduli space is h 3(x; ir). we now see that the deformation space has a natural

interpretation in terms of the kahler and complex structure deformations preserving the
isometry 
z. note that h 3,+ has real dimension h1,2(z) + 1. the extra (+1) dimension
(relative to dimm2,1) corresponds the normalization of the (3, 0) form . the latter is
relevant since, in a local orthonormal frame the calibration must look like

0 = e123 + e145 + e176 + e246 + e257 + e347 + e653

= j  e1 + re[]

(7.5)

2    = 1

and the normalization of  is xed by i
6 j  j  j. here we are using a real
orthonormal frame e1,2,...,7 for t x from which we construct an orthonormal frame for
t 1,0z given by w1 = e2 + ie3, w2 = e4 + ie5, w3 = e6  ie7 and  = w1  w2  w3. the
extra modulus can also be identied with the extra degree of freedom in the radius r of
the circle cotangent to e1. in any case, the moduli space of barely g2 manifolds is a real
line bundle

mg2

2,1  mir

1,1

mir
23

ir+ 

(7.6)

a word of caution is required here. in applications to physics we would regard mg2 as a
real submanifold of the kahler target m for the chiral scalars. such a description is valid
near a large kahler and complex structure boundary, but will receive corrections away

from such boundaries because quantum corrections will change k and could even change
the topology of the moduli space m.

7.2. supersymmetric cycles

the associative 3-cycles in barely g2 manifolds are also easily described. these fall
into two classes analogous to the divisors of types b,a (respectively) in sec. 3 of [2]. the

rst class, which we refer to as holomorphic 3-cycles are of the form

2 ]  s1)/zz2
2 ] is a holomorphic cycle in z mapped to [

[hol]  ([

(7.7)

where [
2 ] by z . that is, z preserves hol
setwise and is orientation reversing. these cycles will be rigid if [
2 ] is a rigid rational
curve in z. if 
2 is a rational curve then hol has the topology of the nontrivial circle
bundle over irp 2 and is hence a rational homology sphere. the second class, which we
refer to as lagrangian 3-cycles, are of the form:

lag = +/zz2

(7.8)

where [+] is a cycle mapped to +[+] by z. examples of such cycles are provided by
special lagrangian spheres in z on which z acts nontrivially. in appendix c we give an
example of such a rigid lagrangian 3-cycle in a barely g2 manifold.

7.3. m -theory on barely g2 manifolds

we now consider the superpotential for m -theory compactication on a barely g2
manifold x. note that the real structure z is orientation reversing on the 6-cycle z, and
therefore h6(x;q) = 0. thus, there are no 5-brane instantons in these compactications.
therefore, the only other nonperturbative contributions (coming from wrapped branes)

are from membranes, and this gives a sum over the two sets of cycles described above:

w = whol(z) + wlag(z)

(7.9)

where whol(z) is the sum over holomorphic curves in z and wlag(z) is the sum over susy
3-cycles in z with the above orientation properties. note these can be expressed purely in

terms of the data of z and its holomorphic (3, 0) form.

24

8. superpotentials in type iia compactications

the compactications we have discussed are closely related to compactications of iia

string theory on g2 manifolds to three dimensions. once again, there will be instanton-

induced superpotentials, arising from many new eects. in the rst place, there can now be

worldsheet instanton eects. moreover, there will be d-brane instanton eects associated

to p = 0, 2, 4, 6 branes wrapping nontrivial classes in h1, h3, h5, h7, respectively. if we
make the mild 11 assumption that h1(x) = h2(x) = h5(x) = 0 then there are no
worldsheet instanton eects, and no d0 or d4 instanton eects. the computation of d2

instantons must be equivalent to the above results since the m2 and d2 brane lagrangians

can be mapped into one another by a change of variables [42]. thus, the main new

unavoidable ingredient is the eect of d6 instantons.

let us consider briey the eects of singly-wrapped d6 instantons, temporarily relax-
ing the restriction h 2(x) = 0 . the action for an elementary d6 brane wrapped on x

is

ei(cid:0)+i7vol(x)(cid:1)

(8.1)

where  = r c(7) and the volume is measured in m -theory units. this follows from the

born-infeld action in iia theory. it can also be obtained directly from m -theory using

the identication between the d6 brane of type iia supergravity and the kaluza-klein
monopole of 11d supergravity, t n  x, where t n is the singly charged taub-nut space
[43]. the metric at innity asymptotes to the metric of ir3  s1  x. putting a boundary
s2s1x near innity where s2 has radius r we compute the m -theory einstein-hilbert
action:

r"

lim

(2)29(cid:18)zir3s1x


q(cid:19)

gr(g) +zs2s1x
(2)29(cid:18)zt nx

1

gr(g)+zt nx

(8.2)

q(cid:19)# = vol(x)/7

where in the rst term we have the at metric on ir3s1, and q is the second fundamental
form (normalized as in (a.1)).

11 for example, for a barely g2 manifold it suces to take b1(z) = 0 and h 2,+(z) = 0. the

latter condition follows if all the kahler classes are induced from an ambient projective space.

25

in addition a single d6 brane carries an abelian super maxwell theory. when the
(2)f is in h2(x; zz) the born-infeld action gives a correction to the instanton

eldstrength 1
action. assuming the background iia eld c(5) = 0, the correction is

i

82 z (c + i3)f  f 

i

48z (c + i3)  p1(t x)

(8.3)

where we have transcribed the result to the m -theory variables c, . the imaginary

part comes from the standard d-brane chern-simons coupling.

in the second term we

have added the real part dictated by holomorphy. note that from [12], lemma 1.1.2,

r   p1(t x) < 0, for g2-manifolds.

now let us consider determinants and zeromodes. when f

(2) is harmonic there are
exactly two fermion zeromodes (if x has only one covariantly constant spinor) and the

instanton can contribute to the superpotential. the determinants for the elds in the

super maxwell multiplet are just

det / 

det (0)

(det (1))1/2 

1

(det (0))3/2

=

det /
| det /|

(8.4)

here det (1) is the laplacian on one-forms and we assume there are no harmonic one-
forms on x. equation (8.4) is established by noting that because rij = 0 on x we have
/2 = 2 where  is the spinor covariant derivative. since s(t x) = 0(x)  1(x) on a
g2 manifold the spinor covariant derivative may be identied with the ordinary one and
the above partition function reduces to a pure phase. as in our discussion of the phase

of membrane determinants one could use pauli-villars regularization to get a phase in
terms of the  invariant, exp[ i
2 (/)], where / is the dirac operator on x. however, this
then requires the addition of counterterms to cancel holomorphy anomalies. again we can

instead dene the determinant to be real, up to a sign, and the sign ambiguity cancels

against that of (8.1), as in [7].

putting all these remarks together we nd the contribution of the wrapped d6-brane

is thus essentially a -function:

z1(x) = ei xh 2(x,zz)

2 ij i j

ei 

where

ei = exp(cid:20)i( + i7vol(x)) 

i

48z (c + i3)  p1(t x)(cid:21)

26

(8.5)

(8.6)

in addition to singly wrapped d6 instantons there can be multiply-wrapped instan-

tons. in m -theory these will be an taub-nut singularities with instanton action

ein(cid:0)+i7vol(x)(cid:1)

(8.7)

the one-loop contributions zn(x) for n > 1 could be extremely interesting and involve
the analog of donaldson theory partition functions for the octonionic instanton equations

in seven dimensions [44,45,46,47,48].

it is worth noting that if z has a real structure

then hermitian yang-mills connections invariant under z provide nontrivial examples of
solutions to the nonabelian octonionic instanton equations on the associated barely g2
manifold x. this gives the rst example (of which we are aware) where these instanton

moduli spaces are nonempty.

in addition there will be mixed d2 + d6 instanton eects. these correspond to

pointlike instantons in the abelian gauge theory, but can be more directly analyzed by
considering m2 branes wrapping   x in m -theory on t n (n)  x where t n (n) is a
(multi-)taub-nut space. our analysis of section 5 continues to apply because t n (n)

is hyperkahler. by holomorphy, only one orientation of m2 brane can contribute to w .

then, in order to have two fermion zero-modes, the taub-nut space must be oriented so
that its covariantly constant spinor is of chirality 

. naively the path integral factorizes
as the product of d2 and d6 instanton eects described below, but we expect d2 d6

interactions to spoil this.

the superpotential now takes the form:

w = xx

 ()eir

(c+i) + xt n(n)

zn(x) + d2d6 instantons

(8.8)

where in the rst sum  () is the path integral from rw and mclean multiplets, as

described above.

9. a mathematical application: counting supersymmetric 3-cycles

let us now combine the above results with mirror symmetry. the family of barely

g2 manifolds is preserved by the mirror map at large complex and kahler structure. that
is, if z is a calabi-yau with a real structure z, then for zero axion (i.e. pure imaginary
complexied kahler form) the mirror z has the same properties. for toric calabi-yau
manifolds this can be proven rather directly by using using the explicit formulae for periods

27

and special coordinates given in [49]. it also follows from the gauged linear sigma model

approach to mirror symmetry described in [50]. physically the assertion is not at all

surprising since the existence of a real structure on z implies cp invariance of heterotic

string compactied on z [51]. we expect that if z has no xed points then neither does

 z for a reason given below.

let us now consider two mirror calabi-yau 3-folds z and z. a choice of z is deter-

mined by a choice of complexied kahler class b + ij and complex structure, the latter

encoded in the holomorphic (3, 0) form . if  z acts freely then by strong mirror symmetry
we have:

iia[

z(b + ij, )  s1

r

(z, 1)

; gs; s] = iia[

z( b + i j, )  s1

r

( z, 1)

; gs; s]

(9.1)

where the freely acting anti-holomorphic involutions z,  z are mapped into each other
by mirror symmetry. note that if z acts freely then so should  z . for, if  z did not act
freely, then the xed point locus could be resolved by blowing up a1 singularities as in

[12]. in that case, there would be an enhanced nonabelian su (2) gauge symmetry in the

mirror theory. (we cannot use mirror symmetry to prove that  z acts freely because the
reasoning would be circular.)

the superpotentials in the three-dimensional eective supergravities based on z, z
must be equal. since we can take the volumes v, v to be both large (by going to both

large kahler and large complex structure moduli of z) we must have equality for the

sum over 3-cycles. since kahler and complex structure moduli are exchanged by mirror

symmetry we conclude that

wlag(z) = whol( z).

(9.2)

it is widely expected that under mirror symmetry there should be a connection between

holomorphic curves and lagrangian 3-cycles. this has been discussed in [52] and is closely

connected to the syz construction [53]. for further recent discussion see [54,55,56]. as far

as we know, the explicit counting formula (9.2) is new. (similar proposals were of course

made in [1]. these concern the curvature of hypermultiplet moduli spaces. in order to

make the proposal of [1] more explicit we would need to investigate the one-loop measures

for several dierent kinds of brane-instantons.)

28

10. heterotic duals

it is interesting to consider the interpretation of membrane-induced superpotentials

in the context of dual heterotic models. some conditions for the existence of such dual

pairs were investigated in [10,57,58,59,60]. here we focus on barely g2 manifolds x =
(z  s1)/zz2. if z admits both a k3 bration p : z  ip1 and an elliptic bration with
section then

m [z  s1] = iia[z] = het [sh  t 2, v ]

(10.1)

where sh is a k3 surface and v is an e8e8 gauge bundle. (see [61] for a review.) taking
a further quotient by zz2 we may expect m [x7] = het [zh, vh] for a calabi-yau zh and
gauge bundle vh. we can give a heterotic string interpretation of the membrane instantons
[hol] and [lag] of section seven by examining the coupling constant dependence of the
instanton action, as in sec. 4 of [2].

let us consider rst [hol]. from (7.5) we nd

zhol

 =

1
2

(r/)(cid:18)z

2

j(cid:19)

(10.2)

where r is the radius of the m -theory circle, and j is the kahler class of z. making the
standard weyl rescaling to the iia string metric we get the action 1
iia where
the kahler class is now with respect to the iia string metric and iia is the string scale.
now we choose a basis of kahler forms for z so that the complexied kahler moduli h, yi
correspond under (10.1) to the heterotic axiodil and wilson lines. under string duality,
h is the kahler class of a section  of the bration  : ip1  z [61]. let [i] be dual
to yi. if [
2 ] = n0[(ip1)] + ni[i] then the instanton contributes an eect w which
depends on vectormultiplet moduli of iia[z] according to:

2 (r

j)/2

2

exp(cid:20)i(n0h + niyi)(cid:21).

(10.3)

if n0 = 0, ni 6= 0 we may interpret these eects in the heterotic theory as worldsheet
instantons localized in sh. if n0 6= 0, ni = 0 we may interpret these eects as spacetime
instantons, corresponding to small heterotic 5-branes. if both n0, ni 6= 0 we have mixed
instantons.

let us now turn to lagrangian-type cycles [lag]. the action only depends on hyper-

multiplet moduli of iia[z] and in iia units at large volume is given by [1]:

exp"

1
2gs

|r |
qirz   

29

+ iz c(3)#

(10.4)

here gs is the 4-dimensional string coupling for iia[z],  is a holomorphic (3, 0) form
on z and c(3) is now a rr potential. further orbifolding by zz2 should not introduce
dependence on the heterotic axiodil (part of a vectormultiplet) and hence we conclude

that these instanton eects correspond to heterotic worldsheet instantons.

this discussion raises several questions. first, it would be nice to understand how

the expression (10.4) becomes a holomorphic function of the complex structure and bundle

moduli of [zh, vh]. (this is partially answered in [62].) second, it is interesting to note
that in the gauged linear sigma model approach to (0, 2) models [63][64] the complexied

kahler moduli have a very dierent origin (fi terms) from the complex structure and

bundle moduli (superpotential terms). it would be interesting to see if this distinction is

related to the above distinction of types of membrane instantons. finally, we note that,

as in [2], it follows that world-sheet instantons can indeed destabilize (0, 2) theories. it

should be interesting to reconcile (2.13) with the phenomena discussed in [65].

11. open membrane instantons

another interesting application of our results is to open membrane instanton eects.

these eects are not well-understood, but should be important in learning about mirror

symmetry through the syz construction [53], the physics of the d1d5 system (via the

papers [66][67]), and in obtaining a deeper understanding of (0, 4) models of supersym-

metric black holes [68][69]. they should also play an important role in the models of low

energy physics discussed in [70,71,72,73,74,75]. there are many nontrivial issues one must

discuss in order to do detailed computations. we hope to return to these elsewhere and

limit ourselves here to some brief preliminary discussion.

we consider the strongly coupled e8  e8 heterotic string, realized as m -theory on
ir4  s1/zz2  z. there can also be 5-branes wrapping ir4  {x}  s, where s  z is
a holomorphic curve. there are now several kinds of membrane instantons. in addition

to the closed 3-manifolds discussed thus far in this paper there are membranes ending on

5-branes and/or 9-branes. the general form of the superpotential will be

w = wc + w55 + w59 + w99 + wgc

(11.1)

here wc is the superpotential arising from closed membrane instantons. wgc is the super-
potential generated by strong infrared dynamics of the boundary gauge theories ( discussed

in [72][73][74]). w99 correspond to the worldsheet instantons [70].

30

let us now consider briey open membranes ending on 5branes. 12 the physical
gerbe connection on the 5brane is c  d where  is the chiral 2-form on the 5-brane
worldvolume. it follows that the instanton action for a membrane ending on a 5brane is

given by

(11.2)

qmembrane := exp(cid:20)i(cid:0)z

 + iz

3vol(cid:1)(cid:21)

the parameter (11.2) will play the role for membranes analogous to the complexied kahler

expansion parameter for open worldsheet instantons. in particular, consider the term w55

corresponding to membranes stretching between dierent 5-branes. reduction of the chiral

2-form on each 5brane results in a complex scalar ai + ixi in a chiral multiplet, where xi is
the position of the 5-branes on the interval s1/zz2 the superpotential w55 will come from
membrane instantons stretching between holomorphic curves in the 5brane worldvolumes.
these will have the topology  = s  [0, 1] and therefore contribute

w55 = xxi>xj

e[aiaj +i(xixj )](zs)t(ij)
55

(11.3)

here z  s is the chiral modulus associated with the size of the holomorphic cycle s  z on
which the membrane ends, z s :=rs(b + ij), where b = ( 
x )c is the superpartner of j.
55 will be essentially given by transition amplitudes

we also expect that the coecients t(ij)
in the rw and mclean topological eld theories discussed above.

the expression (11.3) only holds for xi  xj  . this raises the interesting question
of holomorphy since for the other order the instanton action must be suppressed by 
exp[|xi  xj|]. thus there appears to be nonanalytic behavior on a real codimension one
locus. the resolution of this problem is probably that there is a nontrivial multiple cover

formula for the 55 instantons. thus, we expect a series in q dened by (11.2) and dierent
power series expansions dominate in the regions xi  xj   and xj  xi  . note
that this implies there should be a pole in w55 so it certainly cannot always be neglected

relative to other terms (like wgc).

similar considerations hold for w59. toy models (i.e., choosing a simple ansatz for

the kahler potential) indicate that one can generate interesting potentials for the 5-brane

position moduli.

12 references to the substantial literature on this subject will be given in the hypothetical

future paper mentioned above.

31

12. conclusions

12.1. applications

one immediate application of the above results is that certain g2 compactications of
m -theory are unstable quantum mechanically in the regime where our calculation is valid,

that is for 3-cycles whose volume is large compared to the planck scale. this class includes

smooth g2-manifolds which admit susy 3-cycles which are rational homology spheres. note

that we do not expect any further corrections to the superpotential from non-trivial low-

energy dynamics since the low-energy gauge theory at generic points in the moduli space

consists of u (1) gauge theory with non-chiral matter. thus, (as is hardly surprising), there

is an m-theoretic dine-seiberg problem [76].

12.2. potential applications

we think the mathematical applications for enumerating supersymmetric 3-cycles in

calabi-yau 3-folds are very promising. we anticipate some fairly amazing identities for

sums over supersymmetric 3-cycles weighted by topological invariants such as ray-singer

torsion and the casson invariant.

we hope that some of the technical results found above will be useful in further inves-

tigations of brane-induced instanton eects in other compactications. as one example, it

should be possible to be more explicit about the nonperturbative corrections to hypermul-

tiplet geometry discussed in [1]. it follows, for example, that for a rigid special lagrangian
3-cycle  the factor n in [1] eq. 2.49 is just the order of the nite group: |h1(; zz)|.

our methods suggest some interesting formulae for instanton/anti-instanton eects

such as d2d6 eects. indeed, it follows from [32] that such eects will involve the casson

invariant of . these eects contribute to the induced potential. on the other hand, we

know from supergravity that

v = ek(cid:18)|dw|2  3|w|2(cid:19)

(12.1)

it is possible that by comparing expressions we will learn something about quantum cor-
rections to the kahler potential in d = 4, n = 1 m -theory compactications. of course,
this requires rst an understanding of perturbative contributions to k. in any case, an un-

derstanding of the kahler potential is essential to addressing questions of supersymmetry

breaking, and is sadly lacking.

32

12.3. some unnished business

the present paper has, regrettably, a somewhat programmatic avor. several points

related to the above discussion should be looked into much more thoroughly than we

have done here. first, and foremost, the rules for systematic computation of membrane

instanton eects should be claried.

second, we determined w through the chiral multiplet mass matrix. when one con-

siders the gravitino and gaugino mass matrices one encounters important contact inter-

actions. these need to be sorted out. it is quite likely that doing so will shed light on

nonperturbative corrections to the gauge kinetic function ij (z).

third, we have only stated a complete claim for rigid membrane instantons. in general

there might be contributions from nonisolated instantons. the case of worldsheet instan-

tons can give us some guidance, but the full story remains to be understood. similarly,

the eects of open membrane instantons are potentially very important, but much work

remains to be done here.

appendix a. conventions and notations

a.1. index conventions

we use ams fonts for superspace indices and for superelds (e.g.zm). m = 0, . . . , 10 is

a bosonic world index and  = 1, . . . 32 is a fermionic world index. (we also use  = 0, 1, 2, 3

for bosonic world indices in the noncompact spacetime m4, but the distinction is clear from
context.) a,  are the tangent frame counterparts of m, . e a
m is a frame for the metric
at  = 0. m n... are antisymmetrized gamma matrices of weight one. worldvolume
indices on  are denoted by 1  i, j, k  3, and a generic worldvolume coordinate system
is denoted si. our lorentzian signature is mostly +.

a.2. dierential geometry

our conventions for dierential forms are c = 1

3! cm np dxm dxn dxp . our normaliza-

tion of the second fundamental form is:

m
kl = 

1
2

hmn

qkln

(a.1)

where m
kl is the christoel connection in the ambient space, restricted to . real har-
monic p-forms on a manifold m are denoted hp(m; ir). the forms corresponding to
integral classes under the hodge-derham isomorphism are hp(m; zz).

33

if v is a vector bundle with metric we let s(v ) (or s(v )) denote the minimal

dimension associated spin bundle (there is an implicit choice of spin structure).

we often abbreviate calabi-yau to cy.

a.3. some spinor conventions

in section four we use the following cliord algebra conventions. the three-

dimensional cliord algebra on the m2 world-volume is

 0 = i2

 1 = 1

 2 = 3

(a.2)

the orientation is 012 = 012 = +1. the euclidean continuation is  3 = 2.

the 7-dimensional euclidean cliord algebra c7 is nicely realized using the octo-
nions o. in the cayley-dickson description the octonions can be thought of as pairs of

quaternions with multiplication

(a, b)  (c, d)  (ac  db, da + bc).

(a.3)

choosing an isomorphism of imo = ir7 we dene cliord multiplication by an orthonormal
basis to be octonionic multiplication by the imaginary units. this gives a representation
of i by 8  8 real antisymmetric matrices.

the cliord algebra c8, used for the normal directions to the membrane, is repre-

sented by

1,...,8

0 (cid:19)

1,...,8 =(cid:18) 0
1,...,8
1,...,7 = 1,...,7

8 = 8

(a.4)

where i is the representation of c7 described above, and 1,...,7 is the other inequivalent
representation of c7. we take 8

a a = a a. the chirality operator is

 =(cid:18)18

0

0

18(cid:19)

note that (i)t = i, and (i) = i, i = 1, . . . , 8.

we take the representation of the cliord algebra c(1, 10) to be

m

m

 
=  m
= 12  m

34

(a.5)

(a.6)

it is often convenient to introduce spinor index notation: a = 1, 2, a, a = 1, . . . , 8. the

above matrices are written

( m

)a

b

a a , m
m

a,a

(a.7)

)a

b =  m

note that  m

ab := ( 0 m

ba is symmetric. we raise/lower spinor indices with
ab = (i2)ab. the euclidean continuation is obtained by  3 = 2. then the charge
conjugation matrix (m )t = cm c1 is given by c = i2  .

appendix b. scales and dimensions

our conventions on units and scales are the following:  is the 11-dimensional planck

length. gm n = m n + hm n is dimensionless. local coordinate dierentials dxm have

dimensions of length. thus [vol(g)] = ld on a d-dimensional manifold. a eld (like c )

which is a dierential form is dimensionless. thus

c =

1
3!

cm np dxm dxn dxp

(b.1)

means cm np has dimensions l3. the gravitino m has dimension [m ] = l1/2. with
these conventions, the hodge star  acting: k  nk has dimensions of ln2k. since the
components of mnp are, in an orthonormal frame, the dimensionless structure constants

of the octonions we have [] = l3.

our normalization of the 11d supergravity action is nonstandard. to translate to the

normalizations used, for example, in [70] one sets:

chere

m np =

32
3 chw

m np

(4)29 = 2

(b.2)

also, note that we use standard normalizations for dierential forms so (dc)m np q =
m cnp q + 3terms. finally we made a constant rescaling by g  22/3g.

35

appendix c. some explicit susy 3-cycles

one well-known way to nd supersymmetric 3-cycles is as the xed point set of a real

structure in a calabi-yau manifold z. at rst sight it appears that one cannot use this

idea to construct susy 3-cycles in barely g2 manifolds, because x7 is only smooth if z

acts without xed points - but then we lose the susy cycle! of course, a cy can have

several dierent real structures. any two dier by a holomorphic isometry. therefore,

using cys with both real structures and symmetries we can use one real structure z

(xed point free) to make a barely g2 manifold and study the xed points of another real
structure z to nd susy 3-cycles.

we now give an explicit example of this technique. we consider the family in ip5[2, 4]:

6

x 2

i = 0

6

xi=1
xi=1

aix 4

i = 0

we assume ai 6= 0. the discriminant locus is then dened by the equations:

= 0

1
ai

xii

(c.1)

(c.2)

where i are subsets of {1, 2, . . . , 6} with 2 or more elements. we will take ai so that the
cy is smooth. without loss of generality we may take a2 + a3 = 1.

if ai are real we have the standard real structure z : xi  xi. the xed points are
all real, and there are clearly no real solutions to (c.1). thus we can build a smooth barely
g2 manifold. we will study the alternative real structure with z(xi) = xi, i = 1, 2 and
z(xi) =  xi, i = 3, . . . , 6. the xed point locus is:

x1,2 = y1,2

x3,4,5,6 = iy3,4,5,6

(c.3)

where the coordinates yi are real. thus, the supersymmetric cycle is the intersection of

the xed point locus (c.3) and (c.1) and is given by the solutions with yi real to

1 + y 2
y 2

2 = y 2

3 + r2

a1y 4

1 + a2y 4

2 + a3y 4

3 + f4 = 0

36

(c.4)

4 + y 2

5 + y 2

here r2 = y 2
it is useful to dene:
f4 := r4 f4, where f4 is just a function of the polar angles. we assume a2 + f4 > 0 for all
angles.

6 and f4 is the quartic dened above.

now, it is not dicult to see that the region:

(a1 + a2(r2  1)2 + f4) < 0

(c.5)

is a connected bounded region b near the origin of ir3 and dieomorphic to b3, the
3-ball. the boundary of this region is the surface  dieomorphic to s2. in the region
b there are only two real roots for y3. these two real roots collide and vanish along the
surface . moreover, if 2a2 > 1 then the two roots for y2 are both real and never vanish
in the region b.

we are now in a position to describe our real solution set. there are 4 copies of the
ball b labelled by the 4 real roots (y2, y3). along the surface  the two roots y3
vanish, but the roots y2 are bounded away from zero. therefore, for each root of y2,
we glue two copies of b together along . we get, topologically, two disjoint copies of
s3. now, when we take the quotient by z this acts by taking (y1, y2)  (y1, y2), but
(y3, . . . , y6)  (y3, . . . , y6). this is clearly homotopic to the antipodal map on s3 acting
separately for each disjoint copy. we thus get two disjoint copies of irp 3 in the barely g2
manifold. these are rigid lagrangian 3-cycles.
