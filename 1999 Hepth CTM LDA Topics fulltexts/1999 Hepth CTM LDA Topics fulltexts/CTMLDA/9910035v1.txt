non-perturbative eects of constant magnetic elds in a higgs-yukawa gauge model are studied
using the extremum equations of the eective action for composite operators.
it is found that
the magnetic eld induces a higgs condensate, a fermion-antifermion condensate, and a fermion
dynamical mass, hence breaking the discrete chiral symmetry of the theory. the results imply that
for a non-simple group extension of the present model, the external magnetic eld would induce
gauge symmetry breaking. possible cosmological applications of these results in the electroweak
phase transition are suggested.

symmetry behavior in quantum eld theories under the inuence of external elds has long been a topic of intensive
study in theoretical physics [1]. in the present paper we are interested in particular in non-perturbative eects produced
by external magnetic elds in gauge theories with scalars. our main claim is that for gauge theories with a non-simple
group of gauge symmetry and with scalar-scalar and scalar-fermion interactions, the magnetic eld reinforces gauge
symmetry breaking.

the observation of large-scale galactic magnetic elds in a number of galaxies, in galactic halos, and in clusters of
galaxies [2] has recently stimulated a large number of works trying to explain the physical mechanism responsible for
the origin of these elds. many of the proposed generating mechanisms have compelling arguments in favor of the
existence of strong primordial magnetic elds (for a review of cosmological generating mechanisms see [3] and references
therein). since primordial magnetic elds could play a signicant role in particle cosmology, the investigations on the
theme have recently boomed. in this context, the implications of a magnetic-eld-driven gauge symmetry breaking
mechanism may be important.

several years before this renewed interest in cosmological magnetic elds, ambjrn and olesen [4] considered the
electroweak model in the presence of a constant magnetic eld. assuming certain special values of the couplings,
they obtained a w- and z-condensate solution forming a lattice of abelian vortex lines for a range of magnetic elds
lying between m2
. at even larger values of the magnetic elds they found that the phase transition
to a symmetric phase can be reached at temperatures lower than the critical one at zero eld. this result realizes,
although due to a totally dierent reason, an old suggestion [5] that large magnetic elds could induce the transition
from the broken to the unbroken phase in the electroweak system.

more recently, the ground state of the electroweak theory in the presence of a hypermagnetic eld has been investi-
gated using either numerical or perturbative calculations [6]- [10]. the main motivation of these papers was to study
the possibility that a hypermagnetic eld could allow the realization of baryogenesis within the standard model [6].
even though the original results [6] for the upper bound of the higgs mass needed to have baryogenesis in the sm
were quite optimist, it was quickly realized that higher loop eects [7], [10] and numerical non-perturbative calcu-
lations [8] would signicantly weaken the transition. moreover, posterior studies on which certain subtleties of the
theory- like the magnetic dipole moment of the sphaleron [9] or ring diagrams contributions to the high-temperature
eective potential [10]- were taken into account, concluded that albeit the hypermagnetic eld strengthen the rst
order character of the phase transition, it is not enough to satisfy the sm baryogenesis condition [11]

with v (tc) the higgs vacuum expectation value (vev) at the critical temperature tc of the electroweak phase transition.
none of these studies observed the ambjrn and olesen phase, nevertheless.

when a non-perturbative analytic approach is used to study eld theories in external magnetic elds, new non-
trivial eects are found. an important example of these non-perturbative eects is the formation of a chiral symmetry

breaking fermion condensate <  > and of a dynamically generated fermion mass in the presence of an external
magnetic eld, known in the literature as magnetic catalysis [12]. this phenomenon, which has proven to be rather
universal and model independent, has recently attracted a lot of attention [13]- [18].

on normal circumstances massless fermions can condensate and acquire a dynamical mass, but the condensate
appears only for suciently strong coupling between fermions. the new feature when a magnetic eld is present is
that it favors (catalyzes) the symmetry breaking by reducing to the weakest attractive coupling the strength of the
interaction needed to break the symmetry. the essence of this eect is that the fermions in the lowest landau level
(lll) constitute the eective fermionic degrees of freedom whose dynamics dominates the long wavelength behavior
of the system. the phenomenon is driven by the fact that massless fermions acquire an energy gap in the presence of
a magnetic eld, but there is no energy gap between the vacuum and the lll fermions. then, in the infrared region,
the dynamics of the lll fermions dominates the fermion propagator, making it essentially d-2 dimensional. this
dimensional reduction strengthen the fermion pairing dynamics [12], [19] giving rise to a fermion condensate.

it is worth to mention that the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis is not only interesting from a purely fundamental
point of view, but it has potential application in condensed matter [20]- [23] and cosmology [16]. for instance, it
has been recently speculated that the generation of mass through magnetic catalysis in lower dimensional models
[21], [22], or in four-dimensional models with boundaries [23], could be behind the physical mechanism explaining the
observed scaling of the thermal conductivity in superconducting cuprates with an externally applied magnetic eld
[24]. on the other hand, the magnetic catalysis could inuence the character of the electroweak phase transition as
suggested by the results of ref. [16].

in the present paper we consider a simple model eld theory with the aim of investigating in a self-consistent
way how scalar-scalar and fermion-scalar interactions in the presence of an external magnetic eld can inuence the
stability of the vacuum. it is not intended as a realistic theory, but rather as an example of a large class of theories
with scalar elds, on which dynamical symmetry breaking (either chiral or gauge) can be catalyzed by an external
magnetic eld. in this sense, it could be useful for condensed matter, as well as for cosmological applications. if this
toy model is extended to include a non-simple gauge group theory, as it is the case of the electroweak model, the
results of this paper could provide a scenario, on which, in contrast to the eect found by ambjrn and olesen [4],
an external magnetic eld could induce gauge symmetry breaking through non-perturbative eects.

then, let us consider the following theory of gauge, fermionic and real scalar elds described by the higgs-yukawa

note that a fermion mass term m is forbidden, since it is invariant under (3) and (4), but not under the discrete

chiral symmetry (5).

to study the vacuum instabilities that could arise in the theory (2) under the inuence of an external constant
magnetic eld b, we need to solve the extremum equations of the eective action  for composite operators [25], [26]

(c, g)

where g(x, x) = (x) =(cid:10)0 | (x)(x) | 0(cid:11) is a composite fermion-antifermion eld and c represents the vev of the

higgs eld. thanks to the discrete chiral symmetry (5), it is enough to consider only one composite eld. we choose

2

the composite eld g(x, x), ignoring the second possible one, (x) =(cid:10)0 | (x)i5(x) | 0(cid:11) , since the eective action

can be a function only of the chirally invariant combination 2 = 2 + 2.

the loop expansion of the eective action  for composite operators [25], [26] can be expressed as

in eq. (8) c is a constant and s (c) is the classical action evaluated in the scalar vev (higgs condensate) c. the bar
on the fermion propagator g (x, y) means that it is taken full, while the non-bar notation indicates free propagators,

theory one can use the lowest (two-loop) approximation for 2. this corresponds to the so called quenched ladder
approximation, on which all vertices are taken bare. in this case 2 is

the extremum equations (6) and (7) correspond, respectively, to the schwinger-dyson (sd) equation for the fermion
mass operator  (gap equation), and to the usual minimum equation for the expectation value of the scalar eld,
which in the presence of the magnetic eld has to be determined in a self-consistent way, that is, simultaneously with
the gap equation.

although we have introduced a bare scalar mass  in (2), because we are interested in the possibility of a dynamically

generated scalar mass, we take the limit   0 at the end of our calculations.
the second to fourth terms in the eective action (8) correspond to the one-loop contribution. their evaluation
is quite straightforward (the scalar self-interaction can be renormalized in the usual way [27]), with the exception
perhaps of the fermion contributions, which contain the background magnetic eld. then, let us calculate explicitly
the one-loop fermion contribution coming from the term

the two-loop contributions are a little more involved. since we have not enough space in a letter to give all the
detailed calculations, we will explicitly show, for the sake of understanding, the evaluation of one term. the others
can be found in a similar way. the complete calculation will be published elsewhere.

first, notice that the second and fourth term in eq.(9) generate tadpole diagrams in the sd equation (6). it is easy
to realize that the tadpole diagram from the gauge-fermion vertex vanishes. however, the tadpole associated to the
scalar-fermion vertex is not zero when c 6= 0 and in this case it has a signicant contribution to the gap equation,

we can transform eq.(25) to momentum space with the help of the ep (x) functions [13], [16] to obtain

note that there is no zero solution for the scalar vev in this large eld approximation. both, the minimum of the
scalar eld and the dynamically generated mass are driven by the external magnetic eld. since the fermion mass
vev breaks the discrete chiral symmetry (5) this model might be considered as one more example of the phenomenon
of magnetic catalysis. however, if the current model is extended to include complex scalars (complex scalars do not
change at all the conclusions of this paper) and a non-simple gauge group, as the electroweak model, the symmetry
breaking phenomenon will have a dierent nature. there we do not have chiral symmetry, but the magnetic-eld-
driven scalar vev will break the gauge symmetry by giving mass to the gauge elds coupled to it. thus, as we claimed
at the beginning of the paper, in richer models with scalar elds, the magnetic eld can catalyze gauge symmetry
breaking through non-perturbative eects.

comparing the induced fermion dynamical mass eq.(36) with the mass generated when no scalar eld is present

g2 i , or with the one when the vev of the scalar eld is ne-tuned to zero [16],
4# , one realizes that the scalar interactions, when taken into account in a self-consistent

[12], [13], m  p|gb| exphq 42
m p|gb| exp"r 
correspond to a higgs mass of 115 gev, we would nd m  0.6p|gb|. the same yukawa coupling, on the other hand,
would give just m  105p|gb| if the scalar vev is ne-tuned to zero [16]. in the case of pure gauge interactions, as

way, can dramatically strengthen the generation of mass. this observation is easy to corroborate by direct calculations
of the mass (36) for typical values of the yukawa coupling y and the scalar self-coupling . for instance, if we take
y = 0.7, which would be the approximate value of the yukawa coupling for the top quark, and  = 0.4, which would

for instance in qed, the generated mass would be even much smaller [12], [13].

a non-simple group extension of the model discussed in this work could be of interest as an eective theory in
condensed matter problems, where su (2) u (1) gauge theories (without higgs elds) have been previously proposed
to describe the rich phase structure of high tc superconductors [21].
it seems, however, that the most immediate physical extension of the present model would be the electroweak
theory. this case is particularly interesting in the light of the recent works on the role of magnetic elds in electroweak
baryogenesis [6]- [10]. in view of the magnetic-eld-driven non-perturbative enlargement of the higgs vev, eq. (38),
it is possible that in the electroweak theory the enlargement will be large enough to guarantee the baryogenesis
condition (1) . it remains therefore as an open question whether the eect found in this paper can inuence the recent
conclusions [6]- [10] about baryogenesis in the presence of primordial magnetic elds.
