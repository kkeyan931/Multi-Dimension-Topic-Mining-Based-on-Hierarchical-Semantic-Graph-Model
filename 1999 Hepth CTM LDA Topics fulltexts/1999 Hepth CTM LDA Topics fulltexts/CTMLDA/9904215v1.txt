abstract

we propose and develop a new calculus for local variational dierential
operators. the main dierence of the new formalism with the canonical
dierential calculus is that the image of higher order operators on local
functionals does not contain indenite quantities like (0). we apply this
formalism to bv formulation of general gauge eld theory and to its sp(2)-
symmetric generalization. its relation to a quasiclassical expansion is also
discussed.

1 introduction

in the functional formulation of local quantum eld theory, it is rather common to
encounter a problem that is known as the problem of (0). the essence of the
problem can be illustrated by the following simple example. let s() be a local
functional of a eld (x), say the action

s() =z dxl((x), (x), ...),

 =


x

.

then the second order variational derivative 2s()/(x1)(x2) of this functional
is a quasilocal distribution (for the notion of a quasilocal distribution see subsection
2.3), symbolically, 2s()/(x1)(x2)  (x1  x2). therefore, the second order
variational dierential operators of the type

2 =z dxe2((x), (x), ...)





(x)

(x)

are not dened on local functionals: 2s  (0). these operators are not dened
on the products s1()s2() . . . of local operators, and generally on the functions
f (s1, s2, . . .) of the latter ones, if we assume the standard leibnitz rule

2(s1()s2()    ) = (2s1())s2()    + 2z dxe2(...)

s1
(x)

s2
(x)

   +

s1(2s2)    + ....

the analogous assertions are valid for the higher order dierential derivatives
ns()/(x1) . . . (xn), n > 2, and therefore for the local higher order dierential
operators

n = z dxen((x), (x), ...)(/(x))n.

however, the emergence of such operators is unavoidable in local eld theory. for
instants, they arise when we consider the change of variables in the functional integrals
that dene a theory, in particular, when we seek an invariant measure for local general
gauge eld theory. moreover, the 2-type operator underlies the bv formulation of
gauge theories [1]. the (0)-terms that arise in local theories must be compensated
by the corresponding local measure that is initially singular. it can happen, as for
example in yang  mills or supersymmetric theories, that the coecient at (0) is
equal to zero from the very beginning because of specic algebraic reasons, then the
indeniteness 0   is resolved in favor of the zero.

in a general case, the standard way of avoiding the problem of (0) consists in
chattering something like this:if using dimensional regularization [2], the correspond-
ing singularity  (0) is equal to zero. in other words, the formal rule(0) = 0 is
adopted at intermediate stages of the formulation. the successful experience of op-
erating with this rule makes us to suggest the possibility of such a mathematically
consistent formalism, where (0) does not arise at all. in this paper we realize such

3

a possibility in the framework of a formalism that is proposed below. in this formal-
ism, the absence of (0) is a consequence of the denitions. first of all, the proposed
formalism is applied to the bv formulation of general gauge eld theory. it turns out
that all the contents of the theory remains unchanged. the proposed formalism is
specic just for local eld theory and has no direct analogs in the theory of functions
of nite number of variables. this fact cautions once more against possible attempts
to justify some, basic sometimes, assertions in local eld theory by referring to the
nite-dimensional analogs, and even more, to replace the proofs by such references
[3]. on the other hand, as it will be seen below, the proposed formalism furnishes the
consistent quasiclassical (with respect to the plank constant h) quantization.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec. 2, we dene the appropriate classes of
functionals and operators, formulate the rules of the action of the operators on the
functionals and discuss their properties.
in sec. 3, we consider the special class of
operators of the type exp  and the special class of functionals of the type exp s, as
well as the relation of the proposed formalism to the quasiclassical expansion. in sec.4,
we consider the local changes of variables. in sec.5 and sec.6 respectively, we apply
the proposed formalism to the lagrangian bv formulation of gauge theories and to its
sp(2)-symmetric generalization.

2 functionals, operators 

2.1 fields

we let  = {a(x)} denote the initial elds and use the condensed notations like
ak = ak(xk), e(a)n
(x1, . . . , xn; ). the elds take its values in the berezin
algebra that includes bose and fermi elds on equal footing,their grassmann parities
are denoted by (a) = a. the derivatives with respect to the elds are left,

n = ea1...an

n



ak(xk)

= ak,

(ak) = ak

in addition, we use the following abbreviations:

(a)n = a1 . . . an,

((a)n) =

n

xk=1

ak,

(a)m = a1 . . . am.

the index, which appears twice in the same term, implies a summation (integration).

2.2 functionals

the essential starting point is the restriction on the class of the functionals  of the
elds . first of all, it includes all smooth local functionals si(), i = 1, 2, ..., with the
certain grassmann parity (si) = (i), of the type

si() = z dxli(x, (x), (x), ...),

(1)

4

where a local density li is a smooth function of coordinates x, elds (x) and their
nite order derivatives. the locality of the functional s() implies that its varia-
tional derivatives (a)ns() = /a1(x1) . . . /ak(xk)s() are quasilocal distribu-
tions, symbolically

(a)ns())  (x1  x2)    (xn1  xn).

the functionals  of a general type are smooth functions of local functionals:

() = f (s1, s2, ...) = f (s),

(2)

usually with the certain grassmann parity (f ); we will call them the multilocal func-
tionals. the derivatives with respect to si are left,


si

= i,

(i) = (i).

in the sequel, we use the following natural abbreviations in our notations:

(si)n = si1    sin,

(asi)n = a1si1    ansin,

((si)n) =

(ik),

(a  si)n = (asi)n(1)pn1

f,i1...in = i1 . . . inf.

((asi)n) =

n

n

xk=1
xk=1
j=1 (ij )pn

ak +

n

xk=1

(ik),

k=j+1 ak ,

such that for instance

(i)n = i1 . . . in,


(i)n = in . . . i1,

f,(i)n = f,i1...in ,

f,
(i)n

= f,in...i1 ,

2.3 local variational dierential operators 

on the functional space considered, we dene the multilocal operators, the epithet
multilocal means that the image of the operator lies in the same space of multilo-
cal functionals. we begin with the homogenous local dierential operators n of an
arbitrary order n. let us consider the local dierential expression

n = z dx1 . . . dxnea1...an

n

(x1, . . . , xn; )



a1(x1)

...



an(xn)

= e(a)n

n

(a)n,

(3)

with the certain grassmann parity (n), and with the coecient functions

ea1...an

n

(x1, ..., xn; ) = xm1...mnz dxea1...an

n|m1...mn(x, (x), (x), ...)

n

yk=1

()mk(x  xk),

(4)

5

n

(x1, . . . , xn; ) = e(a)n

n|m1...mn(x, (x), (x), ...) are smooth functions of their arguments. the co-

where ea1...an
ecient functions
ea1...an
are distributions with respect to the space arguments
x1, . . . , xn with the support at the coinciding points x1 = x2 = . . . = xn. following
the tradition established in eld theory [4], we call such distributions the quasilo-
cal distributions. e(a)n
depend locally on the eld , so the variational derivatives
n
an+1...an+me(a)n
are quasilocal distributions with respect to all space arguments
x1, ..., xn, xn+1, ..., xn+m. e(a)n
have the following symmetry properties with respect
to the simultaneous permutations of indices and coordinates

n

n

ea1...akak+1...an

n

(x1, . . . , xk, xk+1, . . . , xn; ) =

(x1, . . . , xk+1, xk, . . . , xn; ),

and the grassmann parity

(e(a)n

n

) = (n) +

n

n denes the operator on the functions f (s) as follows:

(nf )(s) = e(a)n

n

(a  si)nf,
(i)n

(s)  sn(i)nf,
(i)n

(s),

(5)

n!n(si)n = e(a)n

where sn(i)n = sn(i)n[s] = 1
(a  si)n is the derivative from si1,
. . . , sin local functional with the united (multi)index n(i)n, (sn(i)n) = (n) +
k=1 (ik). it is evident that (nf )(s) is a functional of the type considered. denition
(5) can obviously be extended to the case where si are not necessarily local. the general
local dierential operator  is a linear combination of the operators n

pn

n

 = xn=0

cnn,

cn are constants (independent of x and ). 0 = s0 is an arbitrary local functional:
formula (5) enables us to consider the multiplication by a local functional as the zero
order dierential operator. below, we extend this denition to innite sums and, in
such a case, operate with formal series postponing the question on the sense of series
convergence.

the general form of the operators that are well dened on the considered space
of multilocal functionals is a smooth function () = (n1, n2, . . .) of the local
operators n; we call them the multilocal operators. we assume the functions  are
given by formal series that also denes the rule of the action of multilocal operators
on multilocal functionals. it is evident that the image of a multilocal operator belongs
to the space of multilocal functionals.

let us now return to the denition of the operators n. the given denition of
the operator n diers from its canonical understanding, as the dierential operator
that satises leibnitz rule and is then denoted by n (below, we call such operators
the canonical dierential operators), by the additional requirement that it is forbidden

6

for two or more derivatives /a(x) at the same point x to act on one and the same
local functional. this requirement is equivalent to the rule /a1(x)/a2(x)s() =
0, i.e. the prescription (0) = 0, in particular,

n(si)m = 0, n  m + 1.

the relationship between the operators n and n can also be explained from the
quasiclassical expansion point of view. it was noted long ago that the emergence of
(0) in quantum eld theory is accompanied by additional smallness in powers of the
plank constant h, the parameter of the quasiclassical expansion (the loop expansion).
therefore, the operator n corresponding to dierential expression (ref3) can be con-
sidered as a leading quasiclassical approximation to the canonical dierential operator
n. the exact meaning of this statement is the following. let us make the substi-
tutions si  si/h, f (s)  f (s/h) in functionals, /  h/ in derivatives with
respect to the elds, and, at last, n  n(h) = (1/h)e(a)n
(ha)n in dierential
expression (3).

n

in order that the equations to follow might have a sense, it is necessary to refuse from
locality: of either the dierential operators, by regularizing their coecient functions
e(a)n
(x1, ..., xn), or functionals, by assuming si to be regularized nonlocal functionals
(naturally, we can assume this and that). then it is easy to see that we have for the
action of the canonical dierential operator

n

n(h)f (s/h) = (cid:18) 1

h

+

n

xk=1

hk(cid:18) 1

h

(sn(i)n)(cid:19) f,
sn(i)nk(cid:19) f,

(i)nk

(i)n

(s/h)+

(s/h),

where functionals sn(i)nk are given by

sn(i)nk = e(a)k(b)nk

n

(a)k(b  si)nk,

such that

n(h)f (s/h) = n(h)f (s/h) + o(h, s/h),

and o(h, s/h) as a function of s/h has a nonzero order of smallness in h. when
removing the regularization, the functionals sn(i)nk , k  1 become singularities 
(0) and so does o(h, s/h).

it is convenient to set in correspondence to every operator n its symbol n =
n(, p), the functional of the elds  = {a(x)} and their conjugate variables p =
{pa(x)}, (pa) = (a) = a, that is obtained from dierential expression (3) by
formally substituting the variable pa(x) for the variational derivative symbol /a(x):

n = z dx1 . . . dxnea1...an

n

(x1, . . . , xn; )pa1(x1)...pan(xn) = e(a)n

2.4 operator algebra

the considered space of functionals is closed under the action of the multilocal operators
(), so those form an associative algebra. the algebra of the local operators as an
associative algebra is not closed in itself: the product of two operators nm is not a
local dierential operator of the -type. really, the result of the action of the (bilocal)
operator nm on a functional f (s) contains second order variational derivatives of
local functionals si at dierent points, what is impossible for the action of a local
operator of the -type.

however, as the lie algebra, the algebra of the -operators proves to be closed: if

(1), (2) are local, then their commutator

[(1), (2)] = (1)(2)  (1)((1))((2))(2)(1)

is also a local dierential operator. in other words, we may say that the space of the
local operators is closed under the ad-operation,

ad(1)((2)) = [(1), (2)] = (3).

(6)

it is sucient to verify this fact for the homogeneous operators n. if

m = e(a)m

m (a)m, n = e(a)n

n

(a)n

are local, then

[m, n] = mec(a)m1

m

is local too. really, the coecient functions e([m,n])(a)m+n1
dened by the last but
one equality are quasilocal distributions in all coordinates x1, ..., xn+m1 (because,in
fact, they are convolutions of quasilocal distributions); they are dened uniquely in the
class of distributions that are symmetric with respect to simultaneous permutations of
coordinates and indices. this fact is simply formulated in terms of the -symbols. let
us consider the lie algebra of functionals f (, p) generated by the canonical poison
bracket: if f = f (, p), g = g(, p), then

m+n1

{f, g} =

rf
pa

g

a  (1)(f )(g) rg

pa

f
a ,

here and below, the index r denotes the right derivative.  and p are conjugate just in
the sense of this bracket:

{pa(x1), b(x2)} = b

a (x1  x2).

then it is easy to verify that if m, n are the symbols of m and n respectively,
([m,n])

m+n1 is the symbol of their commutator, then

on any , this result extends by linearity.

([m,n])

m+n1 = { m, n}.

3 operators exp  and functionals exp s

later on, we need the multilocal operators of the form exp  treated as formal series

8

e = xn=0

n.

the signicance of these operators is determined by the fact that many transformations
in eld theory, in particular, a change of variables    in functionals, are formulated
in their terms. let us turn our attention to the properties of these operators following
from the fact proved just now that the lie algebra of the -operators is closed, or
equivalently, that the set of these operators is invariant under the ad-operation:
if
(1), (2) are local operators, then ad(1)((2)) is also a local dierential operator.
then the same is valid for

(ad(1))n((2)) = [(1), [(1), . . . , [(1), (2)] . . .]]

, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

the proof is evident by induction, and, at last, for

((2)) = xn=0

(ad(1))n((2)) = (3), (7)

invariant under the ad-operation too. in addition, it is true that

in other words, the space of local dierential operators is

e(1)

e(2)

= e(3)

,

(8)

where (3) is a local dierential operator. this fact is a direct consequence of the
baker-hausdor-dynkin formula [5]:

(3) = (1) + (2) +

1
2

[(1), (2)] + ...,

the dots stand for a series in repeated commutators of (1) and (2).

in other words, the set of the operators exp  is invariant under associative multi-

plication (and denes the corresponding associative algebra in a natural way ).

the functionals of the form f (s) = exp s, where s is a local functional of the form
(1), play a special role in quantum theory. below, we restrict ourselves to the case of
the bose-functionals, (s) = 0. for such functionals, the action of a local operator

 =pn=0 cnn reduces to the multiplication by a local functional:

es = s[s]es, s[s] = xn=0

cn

n!

nsn = xn=0

cne(a)n

(as)n.

(9)

the set of the functionals of this type proves to be invariant under the action of the
operators exp 

ees = es 

,

(10)

9

where s is a local functional. to prove this, let us consider the one-parameter family
of the operators exp (), where 0    1. let us write

ees = es (),

where the functional s() depends smoothly on , s(0) = s, s(1) = s

s() = s + s(1) + ... = xm=0

ms(m), s(0) = s.

(11)

(12)

for this functional, a dierential equation naturally arises: dierentiating eq(11) with
respect to , we obtain

es () =

s()



es ().

but according to eq(9) that holds true also for functionals s not necessarily local,

es () = s[s()]es (),

s[s()] = xn=0

cne(a)n

n

(as())n,

so we nally obtain the dierential equation for s

()

with the initial condition

s()



= s[s()]

s(0) = s.

(13)

(14)

in the class of functionals smooth in , the solution of eq(13,14) is unique. namely,
substituting expansion (12) into eq(13), we obtain the recurrent relations for s(m). in
particular,

s(1) = s[s].

it is interesting to note that the operation exp  is in agreement with the quasiclassical
expansion in the following sense. let us make the substitutions

  (h) = xn=0

cnn(h) = xn=0

cn(cid:18) 1

h

e(a)n

n

(ha)n(cid:19) , s 

1

s.

consider a triple of operators (i), i = 1, 2, 3. then it turns out that if (i) are related
by eq(6), the same holds true for (i)(h)

[(1), (2)] = (3)  [(1)(h), (2)(h)] = (3)(h).

it is sucient to verify this for the homogenous operators n. as a consequence, if
(i) are related by eq(7) or eq(8), the same holds true for (i)(h)

e(1)

(2)e(1)

= (3)  e(1)(h)(2)(h)e(1)(h) = (3)(h),

e(1)

e(2)

= e(3)

 e(1)(h)e(2)(h) = e(3)(h).

it is easy to verify also that if an operator , functionals s and s[s] are related by
eq(9), the same holds true for (h), s/h, s/h (with the same s)

(h)e

h s =

s[s]e

finally, if an operator , functionals s and s are related by eq(10), then it is true
that

s being independent of h. the proof repeats the proof of eq(10): h happily cancels in
the equation for s() that coincides with eq(13), (14). the solution s() does not
depend on h.

4 change of variables

multilocal functionals () and multilocal dierential operators () admit local
change of variables

a = a(x)  a = a(x, (x), (x), . . .),

where a(x, (x), (x), ..) are smooth functions of elds (x) and their nite order
derivatives. this means that a(x)/b(y) are quasilocal distributions

a(x)
b(y)

= p a

b (x, (x), (x), . . . , )(x  y),

p a
b (x, (x), (x), . . . , ) is a polynomial in  with coecients that are local func-
tions of the elds (x) and their derivatives. we assume that the change of variables
conserves the grassmann parity (a) = (a). we also assume that the change is
invertible (at least perturbatively in powers of the eld derivatives), the inverse change
of variables

a   = a(x, (x), (x), ..)

being also local

a(x)
b(y)

qa

b(x, (x), (x), . . . , )(x  y).

hence, the local changes of variables form a group (of dieomorphisms), at least in
some neighborhood of the point a = 0.

the local change of variables denes the local transformation of functionals in a

natural way.

we assume that the functionals () transform according to the scalar (anti)repre-

sentation of the dieomorphism group

() = ().

it is evident that if s() is a local functional of the form (1), then s() is also local.
for multilocal functionals of general form (2) we have

(f (s))() = (f (s))() = (f (s))().

11

thus, the local transformations take the considered set of functionals into itself.

correspondingly, the local changes of variables induce the transformations of local

dierential operators 

()  

() = (),

(15)

this transformations are naturally dened as follows:

(f (s))() = ()f (s())  (f (s))() = (f (s))() = ()f (s()).

for dierential operator n (3), (4) this transformation law takes the form



n = e(a)n

the coecient functions ea1...an
it is evident that if ea1...an
is a quasilocal distribution too (as a convolution of quasilocal distributions). there-
fore, the operator 
of variables extends by linearity. finally, for multilocal operators (), the rule for
change of variables has the form

n is local. for arbitrary operators  =p cnn, the rule for change

()  ().

it is evident that the analogous properties hold true if we dene the transformations
of the functionals and the dierential operators under the change of variables according
to the scalar representation

() = (), 

() = ().

the local changes of variables are realized by operators exp 1. namely, the fol-

lowing formulas take place:

a(x) = e1a(x)

with some local dierential operator 1,

s() = s() = e1s(),

e1f (s) = f (s).

if () is considered as a multiplication operator in the space of functionals, then

this operator denes a bilinear operation on local functionals that is called antibracket.
namely, let s1, s2 be arbitrary local functionals, then the antibracket (s1, s2) is dened

as it follows from (19), (20), the nilpotency property (18) is equivalent to the jacoby
identity for the antibracket

2

2(s1s2s3)  0  (1)((s1)+1)((s3)+1)(s1, (s2, s3)) + cycle(1, 2, 3) = 0.

(22)

in terms of the coecient functions ea1a2
s1 = a(x), s2 = b(y), s3 = c(z) in (22))

2

this condition means (it is sucient to take

(1)(a+1)(c +1)z du ead

2

(x, u; )



d(u)

ebc

2

(y, z; ) + cycle(ax, by, cz) = 0,

or, in the condensed notations,

(1)(a+1)(c +1) ead

2

d ebc

2 + cycle(a, b, c) = 0.

13

(23)

of course, the converse is also true: if the tensor ea1a2
satises antisymmetry condition
(21) and jacoby identity (23), then the operator 2 (17) with ea1a2
dened by (21)
is nilpotent. it is a standard to assume that under the change of variables   , the
antibracket transforms, (., .)  (., .) (the index at the bracket is the symbol of a
new antibracket), according to the following rule:

2

2

(s1, s2)()  (s

1, s

2)() = ras
1

eab

2

bs

2() = (s1, s2)(),

wherefrom it follows that the metric tensor of the antibracket transforms according to
the tensor (anti)representation:

ea1a2

2

(x1, . . . , xn; ) = z dy1dy2

ra1(x1)
b1(y1)

eb1b2

2

(y1, y2; )

a2(x2)
b2(y2)

.

this transformation properties of the antibracket are in agreement with the rules that
are obtained from denition (19) of the antibracket: (s1, s2) = (1)(s1)2(s1s2),
(s1, s2) = (1)(s1)
2(s1s2), and transformation properties (15) of the operators .
in connection with the antibracket (as well as with the master equation, see below),
the question arises on the eld transformation    = e1 that conserve the
antibracket (local canonical changes of variables)

in terms of operators, this means

(s1, s2)() = (s1, s2)().

e12e1 = 2,

(24)

or

[e1, 2] = 0,

i.e. the transformation conserves the operator 2. in terms of the coecient functions,
this means

ea1a2

2

(x1, x2; ).

(x1, x2; ) = ea1a2

2

the class of such transformations depends essentially on the properties of the coef-
cient functions ea1a2
= 0, it includes all
2
in the nite-dimension case, where the coecient functions are
transformations).
nite-dimensional matrices eij
2 , this class of transformations are determined by the
rank of eij
2 .

(for example, in the trivial case ea1a2

2

it is easy to see that property (24) is satised if

1 = [2, f ] = 2f + f 2, = z dx1dx2

rf

a1(x1)

ea1a2

2

(x1, x2; )



a2(x2)

,

where f is a local fermion functional, (f ) = 1. this follows from the relation

[1, 2] = 0

that is easy to verify. it is obvious that

thus, the transformation

1s = (s, f ).

a  a = e[2,f ]a

14

(25)

is canonical.

in the nite-dimensional case, we can show that if the matrix eij

2 is nondegenerate,
then the transformations generated by exp [2, f ] cover all transformations conserving
the antibracket or, what is the same, 2.

5.2 master equation, g transformations

the nilpotent local operator 2, (2) = 1 denes the master equation for local
functionals s()

2e

i

h s = 0

or

(s, s) = 2s2 = 0.

(26)

this equation is nontrivial only for bose functionals. it is evident that this equation is
invariant under the canonical transformations of functionals induced by local canonical
transformations of elds  that conserve the antibracket. in particular, if s is a solution
of the master equation, then

s = e[2,f ]s,

(f ) = 1,

is a solution too. transformation (27) can be represented as

i

h s  e

e

i
h s 

= e[2,f ]e

i

h s.

(27)

(28)

the invariance of the master equation, as well as of the antibracket, under canonical
transformations (28) results from the fact that for a nilpotent operator 2, the operator
[2, f ] commutes with 2. on the other hand, any operator of the form [2, ], with
an arbitrary , commutes with 2. it follows that any transformation of the form

i

h s  e

e

i
h s 

= e[2(h),(h)]e

i

h s,

(29)

with an arbitrary local , () = 1, takes a local solution s of the master equation to
a local solution s (independent of h). we call the transformations of the form (29) the
gauge (g) transformations. note that to represent g transformations as an operator
acting directly on s is a rather complicated problem. it is worth noting also that the
g transformation operators exp [2, ] form an associative algebra.

however, it turns out that for the solutions of the master equation, any g trans-

formation (29) reduces to the canonical transformation (28):

i

h s  e

e

i
h s 

= e[2,f ]e

i

h s,

with some local fermi functional f (). the fact that the functional f does exist can
be proved, for example, as follows. instead of the operator , we consider the operator
. then the relation

e[2(h),(h)]e

h s = e[2,f ()]e

i

i
h s

15

will hold true if, for example, f () is a solution of the equation

z 1

0

de[2,f ()] f ()


= s(), f (0) = 0,

(30)

and the local independent of h fermi functional s() is dened by

h(h)e[2(h),(h)]e

i

h s = s()e[2(h),(h)]e

i

h s.

the formal perturbative in  local solution of eq.(30) for f () exists.

the answer to the question whether g transformations act on the solutions transi-
tively is determined by the properties of the operator 2, i.e. of its coecient functions
ea1a2
, and by additional conditions on s (it is clear that s=0 is a solution anyway).
in the framework of the standard bv formulation of gauge theories, the metric

2

ea1a2

2

is nonsingular whereas the elds  are darboux coordinates for the metric

a(x) = {a(x), 

a(x)},

(

a) = (a) + 1,

2 = z dx(1)(a)



a(x)



a(x)

.

(31)

the elds a are divided into two groups: a = {i, c }, where i are the elds of an
initial classical theory, c  are ghost elds. the elds 
a (called antields) are divided
analogously. the ghost number gh is ascribed to all variables: gh(i) = 0, gh(c ) = 1,
gh(
a) = gh(a)  1. the solution s of master equation (26) is sought in the form
of the power series expansion in c:

s = s + xn=1

s(n), s(n) = o(c n),

(s) = gh(s) = 0,

(32)

s is a local action of the classical theory. the action s is assumed to have a gauge
symmetry, i.e. satises the gauge identities:

ri

(x, (x), (x), . . . , )

s

i(x)

= 0,

where ri
(x, (x), (x), . . . , ) is a polynomial in  with local in x coecients.
in addition, s satises some regularity conditions (see [6] and references therein),
whose essence is that in an arbitrary set of the extremals s/i(x) and their space
derivatives, it is possible to distinguish linearly (with local coecients) dependent
and linearly independent elements, and the only relations between them are linear
combinations (with local coecients) of the gauge identities and their space derivatives.
under these regularity conditions, it was proved [6] that the master equation does have
the local solutions of form (32) and the arbitrariness in these solutions is described by

16

canonical transformations (27), i.e.the canonical transformations act on the space of
the solutions of form (32) transitively.

let us compare the expressions given above with the analogous formal expressions
in the bv formalism [1]. the analog of the nilpotent operator 2 is the canonical sec-
ond order dierential operator 2 (we restrict ourselves to the case where the variables
a(x) are the darboux coordinates for the metric ea1a2
, i.e., the dierential expres-
sions for 2 and 2 have form (31)). formally, the action in quantum eld theory
must satisfy the quantum master equation

2

or

2e

i

h s = 0

2

(s, s) = ih2s.

(33)

equation (26) and formal equation (33) diers by the terms proportional to  h(0), i.e.
master equation (26) is a quasiclassical approximation to master equation (33), and the
solutions of master equation (26) are the zero order in h (quasiclassical) approximations
to the solutions of quantum master equation (33).
a formal operator of the g transformations is

e[2,f ] = de[2,f ] = e

i

h (ih ln d)e[2,f ],

(34)

where

d =

d()
d()

=  d()

d()!1/2

, a = e[2,f ]a.

a functional s related to a functional s by

i
h s 

e

= e[2,f ]e

i

h s,

is a solution of the quantum master equation if s is. thus, the operator exp ([2, f ])
is a quasiclassical approximation to formal operator (34).

another fact is also worth noting. as a standard, the following boundary conditions

are imposed on a solution of master equation (33):

s|h=0,c=0 = s.

in this case, although operators (34) take a solution of the master equation to a solution
but do not act on the solutions transitively [7].

6 sp(2) master equation

in this section, we consider the sp(2) master equation [8] that describes the sp(2)-
symmetric generalization of the bv formalism. the full set of variables  of the theory
(in this section we change a little the notations for the indices at the variables ) is
aa, a, a, b, c = 1, 2, every variable being a function of the
divided into the groups a, 
coordinates x. in its turn, the variables a are divided into groups a = (i, c b, b),

where i are the classical theory variables, c b are the ghost and antighost elds, and
b are the gauge introducing elds. the grassmann parity is ascribed to all elds:
(a) = ( a) = a, (
aa) = a + 1, (b) = , (c b) =  + 1, as well as the new
ghost number ngh: ngh() = 0, ngh(c b) = 1, ngh(b) = 2, ngh( ) = 2  ngh(),
ngh(
a) = 1  ngh(), ngh(fm) = ngh(f) + ngh(m). in the sp(2) formalism the
eective action s(, 

a, ) satises the sp(2) master equation

the doublet of the antibrackets is related to the doublet of the operators a

2 by

a b + b a = 0.

(s1, s2)a = (1)(s1)a

2(s1s2).

using the operators a, we can write the sp(2) master equation in the following
equivalent form:

a(h)e

i

h s = 0.

(36)

under the same assumptions that were described in subsec. 5.2, in [9] it was shown
that the sp(2) master equation has local solutions, as well as the arbitrariness in the
general solution was found. we shall show that the formalism considered here is a
natural apparatus for this purpose.

we introduce the class of operators, which we call the gauge (g) transformation

operators,

k = eu , u =

1
2

ab[ b, [ a, ]],

(u) = 0,

(37)

18

where  is an arbitrary local operator, () = 0. it is evident that the operator u has
the property

[ a, u] = 0,

(38)

(39)

and, as a consequence, the g transformation operator commutes with the operators
a

[ a, k] = [ a, eu ] = 0.

it follows from (38) that the operators u form the lie algebra

[u (1), u (2)] =

1
2

ab[ b, [ a, 3]] = u (3), 3 = [u (1), (2)].

then, according to the baker hausdordynkin formula, we have

eu (1)

eu (2)

= eu (3)

,

therefore, the g transformation operators form the associative algebra. it follows from
the results of sec. 3 that if s is a local functional and independent of h, then the
functional s dened by

i
h s 

e

= k(h)e

i

h s,

k(h) = eu (h), u(h) =

ab[ b(h), [ a(h), (h)]],

is local and independent of h.
equation (35), then because of (39), the functional s satises the sp(2) master equation
too

a(h)e

the perturbative in  solution of the latter equation exists . thus, if we consider
the action of the g transformation operators (37) on the functionals exp ( i
hs), where
s obeys sp(2) master equation, we can restrict ourselves to the g transformation
operators with  = 0.

note that any change of the elds a,

a  a = a() = et b ()b a,

can be extended to the g transformation in the following sense:

e

i

2 ab[ b,[ a, at a]]g()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

a= =0

g() = g()|= =0 .

= et aag() = g(),

let us now proceed to describing the arbitrariness in the solution of the sp(2)

master equation. let s = s +pn=1 s(n), s(n)  c kbnk be a solution of the sp(2)

master equation with

s(1) =z dx(cid:16)c ari

it was shown in [9] that if two solutions s and s1 coincide up to the n-th order of the
series expansion in variables c b, b, then their dierence s(n+1) in the (n + 1)-th
order

s1  s = s(n+1) + o(c kbn+2k),

s(n+1)  c kbn+1k,

can be represented in the form

s(n+1) =

satises the sp(2) master equation and diers from s starting from the (n + 2)-th
order. as far as all solutions coincide in the zero order in c and b, then using the
induction method, we nally obtain the following result: the general solution s of the
sp(2) master equation can be constructed from a particular solution s with the help
of the g transformation operator

i.e., the g transformations act on the solutions of the sp(2) master equation transi-
tively, and we can restrict ourselves to the g transformation operators of form (37)
with  = 0.

as in subsec. 5.2, we can verify that the operators a and the g transformation
operators (37) are the quasiclassical approximations to the formal nilpotent operators
a and to the g transformation operators of form (37) with u = 1
2ab[ b, [ a, ]],
respectively, the dierential expressions for the canonical operators a and  coinciding
with the corresponding expressions for the operators a and .
