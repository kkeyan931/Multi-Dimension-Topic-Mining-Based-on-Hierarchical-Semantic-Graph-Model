we discuss the ten dimensional black holes made of d0-branes in the regime where

the eective coupling is large, and yet the 11d geometry is unimportant. we suggest that

these black holes can be interpreted as excitations over the threshold bound state. thus,

the entropy formula for the former is used to predict a scaling region of the wave function

of the latter. the horizon radius and the mass gap predicted in this picture agree with the

formulas derived from the classical geometry.

the 10 dimensional black hole consisting of d0-branes in the regime where the clas-

sical 10 dimensional geometry dened by the string metric is reliable has been hard to

understand. this diculty is caused partly by the large eective coupling constant in the

d0-brane quantum mechanics, and partly by the fact that unlike other higher dimensional

d-branes, d0-branes are highly dynamical due to the heisenberg uncertainty relation.

our basic observation in this paper is that the black hole in the regime of interest can

be regarded as a small excitation over the large n threshold bound state. thus, it is hope-

less to make a rst principle calculation concerning the black hole without understanding

the bound state rst. what we shall do here is to postulate that there is a scaling regime

where the one-particle wave function obeys a power law, matching the entropy formulas

xes the exponent. as a consistency check, we show that the correct formula for the hori-

zon radius emerges naturally in this picture. we also estimate the mass gap in the black

hole background.

the near horizon geometry of a d0-brane black hole is given by [1]

ds2 = f dt2 + f 1du 2 + u 3/2d2
e = gs(cid:18) 

0 (cid:19)3/4

where

f =

 = 603gsn.

(2)

we have set  = 1. it was argued by polchinski that there is a duality between m theory

dened on the background geometry of the threshold bound state and quantum mechanics

of d0-branes in the large n limit [2]. for related discussions, see [3].

this duality reduces to that between the iia theory and d0-brane quantum mechanics

when the curvature is smaller than the string scale, and the dilaton is suciently small.

the conditions are just [1]

the entropy of the black hole is given by

s = n 2

ef f ,

(6)

again a numerical factor is dropped. conditions (3) are rewritten in terms of the eective

coupling

1  ef f  n 10/7.

(7)

since the eective coupling is large, it is hopeless to describe this black hole using the

perturbative quantum mechanics of d0-branes. also notice that there is a upper bound

on the eective coupling, this is to avoid the m theory region where the eective 11th

dimension becomes larger than the planck length. thus, the 10 dimensional black hole

we are aiming to describe in this paper is dierent from the matrix black holes discussed

in [4,5]. this upper bound also indicates that for a given temperature, we do not have to

hold the t hooft coupling xed. indeed, the natural limit in matrix theory is to hold the

yang-mills coupling xed. it is unclear whether a dierent phase should occur when one
crosses the upper bound for ef f . the entropy of the black hole is of order n 8/7 at this
bound, this is still larger than n where a localization transition occurs, for a systemacally

discussion on the phase diagram, see [6]. we shall here adopt a conservative viewpoint,

and obey the upper bound.

as in the background of any black hole in any dimension, there is a mass gap. the mass

gap is determined by the hawking temperature. a wkb solution of the dilaton equation of

motion clearly indicates that indeed this mass gap is order of the temperature [7]. we shall

not quote the precise formula here, since we will not try to calculate the exact coecient.

again, this behavior is hard to understand in terms of the perturbative nonabelian quantum

mechanics, which is valid only in the high temperature regime. a rather straightforward
calculation shows that the one-loop mass gap m2 is actually negative, and is proportional
to ef f t 2, see the appendix.

recently it has been argued that the size of the large n threshold bound state grows

with n as n 1/3 [2,8]. the bound state is a highly nonabelian object.

it is impossible

to separate the d0-brane degrees of freedom from the o-diagonal elements.

it is still

reasonable to talk about the density of d0-branes. the situation is similar to the matrix

membrane [9], where the object is also highly nonabelian, nevertheless so long if n is

2

suciently large, it is meaningful to dene d0-brane or the longitudinal momentum density

along the membrane.

we shall not repeat the argument which leads to the estimate of the size of the bound
state l  n 1/3lp. for our purpose, it is sucient to know the order of magnitude of a few
relevant quantities. the size can be measured by the quantity 1/nhtrx 2i = l2, x is one
of the nine bosonic matrices. the typical frequency of an o-diagonal element is of order

[8]

 = n 1/3rl2
p ,

(8)

thus the zero-point energy of an o-diagonal state is of this order. this huge amount

of energy is supposed to be canceled by contribution from the fermionic uctuations. if

we assume that the black hole is a small excitation over the threshold bound state, the

surplus energy must come from excitations of the o-diagonal elements. this is because
the energy is of order n 2 when ef f is held xed. the typical energy carried by such
elementary quanta is just t . this is much smaller than  since /t = 1/3
ef f  1. indeed
this is a small uctuation over the bound state conguration as long as the bosonic degrees

are concerned. so the wave function will not be signicantly changed by the uctuation.

this is our basic observation.

it is easy to see that the condition ef f  1 is also equivalent to the condition r0  l.
physically, one would imagine that it is sucient to know the shape of the wave function

in this region in order to calculate the thermodynamic quantities of the black hole. this

will turn out to be true. for our purpose, it it enough to know the density of d0-branes
in this region, (r)  |(r)|2. we shall adopt the following scaling ansatz

(r) = cn l9(cid:16) r

l(cid:17)

,

(9)

where  is to be determined, c is a numeric constant which we will drop henceforth. we

used rotational invariance in this ansatz. obviously, l must be the only relevant scale in

this problem. beyond l, there may be another scaling region which can not be probed by

black hole. this is the perturbative region in quantum mechanics, however.

the above ansatz is valid only when we smear over scales much larger than the average

spacing between two neighboring d0-branes. as we have emphasized, it is dicult to dene

such spacing with a highly nonabelian conguration. when we make an observation only
in one direction, say x, it makes sense to dene such a spacing. it is l/n  n 2/3lp, a
rather small quantity in the large n limit. the high density in one dimension is caused by

3

the projection. a naive denition of the true spacing is a  (l9/n )1/9  n 2/9lp. this is
a rather large quantity. lacking a better denition, we shall use this naive one here.

the frequency for a diagonal element stretched between a d0-brane at point x and

another d0-brane at point y is r|x  y|l3

p , thus the boltzmann weight is a function

f (r|x  y|l3

p |).

(10)

we shall not specify this function. for a bosonic degree of freedom, f (x) = (ex 1)1, and
for a fermionic degree of freedom, it is f (x) = (ex + 1)1. to include all possible states,

f can be more complicated. (there is no chemical potential, since indiviual elementary

quanta associated to an o-diagonal element are not conserved.) the contribution of these
states to the free energy is another function g(x). for a boson, it is ln(1  ex) and for a
fermion, it is ln(1 + ex). the total free energy is

f = z (x)(y)d9xd9y g(r|x  y|l3
p |).

rescaling x  lx and using the ansatz (9) we obtain

f = n 2z d9xd9y |x||y|g(1/3

ef f|x  y|).

(11)

(12)

the entropy can be obtained using the standard formula s = e  f .
it is obvious
that the entropy is a function of n 2 and ef f only, just like f . this result justies our
observation that indeed the black hole is a thermal excitation over the threshold bound

state.

to obtain the right dependence on ef f , let us do a further rescaling x  

1/3
ef f x.

the free energy reads

f = n 2

(2+18)/3
ef f

z d9xd9y |x||y|g(|x  y|).

(13)

now the integral is a pure number. matching onto the scaling in (6) determines the

exponent

 = 

81
10

.

(14)

this is our main result in this paper. with this exponent, it is obvious that the integral

r d9x(x) is convergent at the origin, and divergent at large x. this is just ne, since
our ansatz (9) is supposed to be valid only for |x| < l. we shall see shortly that this
restriction agrees with the black hole physics as governed by formula (13). beyond the size

4

l, we enter into the perturbative region of quantum mechanics. for a threshold bound

state, the decay of the wave function at suciently large distance also obeys a power law.
the exponent in the asymptotic region must be smaller than 9.

we still have to worry about the convergence of the integral in (13). the function g(x)

damps fast for large x, peaks at x = 0. integrating over y rst, we shall obtain another
factor |x|a9, where a is the cut-o between two neighboring d0-branes. this cut-o, in
terms of the rescaled distance as in (13), is

a = (n 2/9lp)l11/3

ef f  n 1/91/3
ef f .

(15)

this is a rather small number for a xed ef f . thus, the nal integral over x is convergent
for large |x|. however, this integral is divergent for small |x|, since the integrand is
roughly |x|2. notice that the exponent gets doubled because we are considering the
region |x  y|  0 and |x|  0.
in such region, we can no longer trust the density
function (x), as this function is obtained by smearing over distances large than the
averaging spacing. so, |x| as well as |y| must be cut o by a too. the contribution to the
integral in this region is of order a2+18 = a9/5. this tends to zero in the large n limit.

we conclude that the integral in (13) is a nite pure number.

1/3
ef f ,
in terms of the coordinates before rescaling. this size is smaller than l, but independent

the contribution to the integral in (13) mainly comes from the region |x|  l

of n . thus it can not be identied with the horizon radius (5). there may be a few

dierent denitions of the horizon radius. one simple denition is the subtracted quantity
1/nhtrx 2i. by subtraction we mean that the physical contribution to the average comes
only from the thermal uctuations. this is reasonable, since by scattering an object against

a threshold bound state, the wave function size should be not probed, as a basic assumption

in a holographic theory. another more precise denition is proposed in [10]. the proposal

is that the horizon radius is where a tachyonic mode develops between a probing d0-brane

and the black hole. the authors of [10] argue that the horizon radius is determined by the

rst negative eigen-value of the following matrix

hm 2

iji = hij x2 + 2[xi, xj]i.

(16)

it is expected that the negative eigen-value will be of order 1/nhtrx 2i. since we are not
trying to compute the exact coecient, we will not endeavor to use the above denition.

. there are three scales

(21)

we are fortunate that it is not the last scale being identied with the horizon radius. the

correct horizon radius we obtained is a strong consistency check of our picture.

the next thing we wish to do is to identify the mass gap. our denition of the mass

gap is the quantity m2 appearing in the following eective action

s =

1

r z dttr(cid:16)( x)2 + m2x 2 + . . .(cid:17) ,

(22)

where we use the euclidean time, the dots denote high order terms. the quadratic term
trx 2 comes from thermal uctuations. we expect the answer be m2  t 2. as explained
in the appendix, this is going to be a nonperturbative result.

it is rather easy to see how to compute m2 in our picture. it is just the average mass
p tr[xi, xj]4 in the matrix action,
p |x  y|2. an additional factor r

square of stretched strings. from the quadratic term rl6
we nd the right quantity to be averaged over is r2l6

6

comes from our denition in (22). obviously, up to a numerical factor, one can replace
|x  y|2 by (l

1/3
ef f )2. therefore the mass gap is

m2  r2l6

p (l

1/3
ef f )2 = t 2.

(23)

we see that all factors depending on r, lp and n cancel.

in a way, we should not be

surprised by this result.

it is possible to follow the strategy of [11] to compute the hawking radiation rate. it

may also be possible to use the exact coecient in the entropy formula to x the coecient

in the formula of d0-brane density, then coecients in other physical quantities may be

computed within our picture. we are only beginning to investigate the fasinating subject

of the large n d0-brane threshold bound state, and its role in the duality between the large

n d0-brane quantum mechanics and m theory. we have only performed some qualitative

analysis. hard work remains to be done.

i understand that d. kabat and g. lifschytz have been investigating the ten dimen-

sional black holes along a dierent line.

appendix

there are a few papers discussing d0-brane statistical mechanics in the perturbative

regime [12]. to our knowledge, the one-loop mass gap has never been computed. we will

give a formula at the one-loop level here.

the mass gap is the coecient appearing in the eective quadratic potential. one

way to compute the static potential is to use the background eld method. the rst step

is to x the gauge. in general, the gauge eld a can be put into a diagonal form, each

diagonal element represent a u(1) holonomy. we are only interested in the mass gap, so

we set a = 0. for fermions, since the action is quadratic, one can even compute the exact

static potential coming from this part. the simplest way to compute it is to start with

the hamiltonian formalism. for a given static background xi, the hamiltonian is simply

hf =

g

tr (i[xi, ]) =

na,bb
a
,

(26)

where a, b are indices of the su(n) lie algebra, and ,  are spinor indices. we have rescaled
s such that {a

} = 2ab. the 16(n 2  1)  16(n 2  1) matrix n is

na,b =

(27)

it is easy to check that n is an antisymmetric matrix.

now a

 form a 16(n 2  1) dimensional cliord algebra. the fermionic hilbert space
is a spinor representation of this algebra. the static potential is encoded in trehf . since
n is an even rank antisymmetric matrix, by an orthogonal rotation, it can be put into the
jordan form. once this done, we see that

trehf = (cid:0)det(en + en )(cid:1)1/2

.

(28)

the determinant is invariant under the orthogonal rotation, thus the above formula is valid
for a general n . for a small n , one can perform a perturbative expansion. the rst term
in the eective action is quadratic in n . indeed we have
trehf = e1/4trn 2+...,

where the trace is taken over (a, ). in the end, we have

trehf = eng2trx2+....

(29)

apparently, this expansion is valid when the coupling ef f = n g2 is small. we see that
the contribution of fermionic uctuations to the mass gap m2 is negative.

it is a little more complicated to compute the contributions from bosonic uctuations.

we separate bosonic matrices into a sum of the background and the uctuation xi + yi.

the path integral can be performed in two steps. first one convert it into the form trehb .

this gives the result

trehb = (cid:16)det[sinh(

m/2)](cid:17)

.

(32)

this result is singular when m = 0. the problem is caused by zero modes. we have
already included the zero modes in the background elds, the contribution of this part

must be subtracted. the subtracted result is then

det[m/2]
det[sinh(m/2)]

.

(33)

for small m, the contribution to the eective action from bosonic uctuations is then

trm =

n g2trx2 + . . . .

(34)

although this contribution to the mass square is positive, its magnitude is smaller than
that from fermionic uctuations. the overall mass gap m2 is negative. if we rescale back
to the original time and elds x, we see that m2  n g2t 2  ef f t 2.

it is not surprising to have a negative mass square at a nite temperature. the pres-

ence of temperature breaks supersymmetry, thus the cancellation between bosonic uctu-

ations and fermionic uctuations is spoiled. the phase space of bosons is overwhelmed by

that of fermions, that at short distance there is a repulsive force. this agrees with the

result for two d0-branes in the last paper of [12], where integration over the holonomy of

the gauge eld is also taken into account. we expect that high order terms in the static

potential takes over for large x, thus the net force will be attractive.

as we have seen in the main body of this paper, the mass gap m2 is positive in the

strong coupling regime, and is independent of ef f . when one tunes down ef f , there
must be a point where the mass gap vanishes. one might take this point as a phase

transition point. this phase transition is generally predicted in [13].
