abstract

we compute part of the supereld in terms of the component elds of 11-
dimensional on-shell supergravity by using gauge completion in 2nd-order for-
malism. the result is the same as was derived recently in 1.5-order formalism by b.
de wit, k. peeters and j. plefka. we use 2nd-order formalism because in order to
hold -invariance generally 2nd-order formalism is more hopeful and simpler than
1.5-order formalism.

1 introduction

some years ago, t. banks, w. fischler, s. h. shenker and l. susskind (bfss) proposed
that matrix theory gives a complete description of light-front m-theory [1]. it had been
proposed as a theory of d0-branes by e. witten [2].

in two years following the bfss conjecture, it has become clear that matrix model
encodes a remarkable amount of the structure of m-theory and 11-dimensional supergrav-
ity(for reviews, see [3]). the interaction between gravitons in matrix theory has been
shown to agree with supergravity to some extent [4].

however, this theory is constructed on at spacetime, therefore matrix theory on
curved backgrounds is required. for single d0-branes, the theory on curved backgrounds
is expected to be described by born-infeld action [5]. for multi-particle system of d0-
branes, namely matrix model, the theory on curved backgrounds is as yet unknown.
there are many trials to this problem. for example, starting from at matrix theory,
backgrounds are produced by many d0-branes [6]. the other idea is that it is expected
as supermembrane on curved backgrounds [7]. in this paper we adopt the later idea.

the theory of supermembrane is described as nonlinear sigma model [8]. supermem-
brane consistently couples to 11-dimensional superspace backgrounds that satisfy a num-
ber of constraints which are equivalent to 11-dimensional on-shell supergravity [9]. after
light cone gauge xing and -symmetry gauge xing, supermembrane theory on at back-
grounds is equivalent to a quantum-mechanical model with supersymmetric u(n) gauge
symmetry in the large n limit by use of matrix regularization [10].
it has a contin-
uous mass spectrum and instability [11], therefore it is expected that supermembrane
matrix theory describes second quantization of d0-branes [12]. from the beginning of
sigma model, it couples to general backgrounds, therefore it is expected that sigma model
on curved backgrounds is candidate of matrix theory on curved backgrounds. actually
curved backgrounds for supermembrane were investigated [7]. in this reference, they used
1.5-order formalism.

in this paper, we use 2nd-order formalism because in order to hold the -invariance
generally 2nd-order formalism is simpler and more hopeful than 1.5-order formalism.
we obtain the result that is the same as that was drived in this reference [7] up to obtained
components. and the equations for higher order components in 2nd-order formalism are
dierent from those in 1.5-order formalism.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we review the supermembrane the-
ory and the condition of -symmetry.
in section 3, we explain our notations of the
11-dimensional supergravity and obtain the full algebra of transformations in component
formalism. in section 4, we explain our notations of the superspace geometry and ob-

2

tain the full algebra of transformations in superspace.
in section 5, we explain gauge
completion and compute part of the superelds. in section 6, we discuss importance of
2nd-order formalism. other notations and conventions used throughout this paper are
summarized in appendix.

2 supermembrane theory

super membrane theory is described as nonlinear sigma model [8]. it is written in terms
of superspace embedding coordinates z m () = (x m(), ()) , which are functions of the
three world-volume coordinate i(i = 0, 1, 2) .

the action is

from this action, after gauge xing of -symmetry and reparametrization invariance,
using matrix regularization we obtain matrix model [10]. in this paper we dont struggle
in more detail.

note that the spin connection  has supersymmetry variation according to elfbein and
gravitinos variation in 2nd-order formalism [14]. while in 1.5-order formalism, it is
dened as a dependent eld determined by its equation of motion, whereas its supersym-
metry variation is treated as if it were an independent eld [15]. in this paper we use
2nd-order formalism.

4 superspace representation

in this section, we explain notations of the superspace geometry and obtain the full
algebra of transformations in 11-dimensional superspace. as usual, we suppose that
the superspace has lorentzian tangent space structure and the vielbein e a
m and the
connection  b

m a and the corresponding 1-forms

ea = dzm e a
m ,
 b
a = dzm  b
m a .

the lorentzian assumption implies

ab = ba,
b = 0,

.

there are also 3-form potential

b =

dzldzm dzn bn m l,

and eld strength 4-form

h = db =

dzkdzldzm dzn hn m lk.

from these basic elds we can dene the torsion and curvature as follows

t a  dea,
a  d b

a +  c

where covariant derivative d is dened as follows

one then has the bianchi identities

dt a = ebr a

a = 0,
dh = 0.

the supertransformation is equal to

for p-forms components. the local lorentz transformations are equal to

the supergauge transformations are equal to

we obtain the full algebra of these transformations as follows

[t (1) + l(1) + g(1m n ), t (2) + l(2) + g(2m n )]
= t (3) + l(3) + g(3m n ),

there are a great number of component elds in superspace. thus if we try to identify
superspace representation as ordinary supergravity, there are a great number of unknown
degrees of freedom. the method of this identication is known as gauge completion [16].
we shall explain it in the next section.

5 gauge completion

gauge completion was introduced in order to identify superspace representation as on-
shell supergravity [16]. in this section we review this method and compute part of the
supereld in terms of the on-shell supergravity elds.

using this method in 2nd-order formalism, up to rst order in anticommuting coordi-
nates, the supereld component was investigated by e. cremmer and s. ferrara [9]. and
in 1.5-order formalism, part of component at second order in anticommuting coordinates
was investigated by b. de wit, k. peeters and j. plefka [7].

8

gauge completion is nding the superelds and superparameters which are compat-
ible with ordinary supergravity. that is to say, supertransformations (4.8) - (4.10) are
identied as transformations in 11-dimensional spacetime (3.5) - (3.11) and the  = 0 com-
ponents of superelds and super parameters are identied as the elds and parameters of
ordinary supergravity.

firstly, a gauge is chosen as follows

m

e a(0)
e (0)
 a(0)

m ,
=  
m ,
=  a
m b,
mb
m(0) = m,
(0) = ,
(0)
b(0)

mn = mn,
mnl = cmnl.

from (4.9) and (3.10), we obtain

and we introduce some assumptions as follows

 a (0)

b

= a

b.

(0)
(1)

n = 0,

n = 0.

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

then, the higher order component in anticommuting coordinates can be obtained by
requiring consistency between the algebra of superspace supergravity and that of ordinary
supergravity.

to make this procedure clear, we write one simple example explicitly. we take  = 0

component of vielbein.

according to superspace algebra,

e a

m |=0 = (kk e a

m + mk e a

= kke a

m + mke a
+ e b

+me a(1)



b )|=0

k + e b

while in ordinary supergravity

e a

m = kke a

m + mke a

k + 2am + a

by this procedure, we obtain the following results.

3-form elds are obtained up to rst order in anticommuting coordinates. in order to
compute this at second order in anticommuting coordinates, the superparameter m n at
second order is needed. and in order to compute m n at second order in anticommuting
coordinates, the superparameter m at second order is needed. thus we cant compute
3-form elds at second order. however, because at geometry is known (2.10), we include
the 3 term in b and the 2 term in bm for completeness.

we obtained all components which was required in order to write the action (2.1) up

to 2 term.

the components of vielbein and 3-form eld obtained above is the same as was con-
structed before [7]. thus this result holds the invariance of -symmetry. however the
other components and the equations which components of vielbein and 3-form and su-
perparameter at second order in anticommuting coordinates must obey are dierent from
those in reference [7]. these can be written explicitly as follows,

6 discussion

using 2nd-order formalism we obtained the same results as that was given in reference [7]
up to obtained components, but at higher order it seems to be dierent from that in
1.5-order formalism.
in order to obtain superspace geometry which holds -invariance
2nd-order formalism may be much simpler and more hopeful than 1.5-order formalism.
as seen in section 2, the condition for -invariance is given on torsion. from the denition
of torsion (4.5),

e 

m e 

n t a

[m  a
n]b

at  = 0 component,

 
m  

n t a

,

(6.1)

(6.2)

this is compatible with denition of spin connection (3.2) and constraint for -invariance
(2.5).

if we use 1.5-order formalism, the constraint (2.5) is not invariant under supersymme-
try transformations. thus -invariance of action (2.1) will be realized in very complicated
form at higher order in anticommuting coordinates.

but, if we use 2nd-order formalism we can obtain superelds which hold the conditions
(2.5). thus for higher components in order to hold -invariance 2nd-order formalism is
expected to be more hopeful than 1.5-order formalism.
