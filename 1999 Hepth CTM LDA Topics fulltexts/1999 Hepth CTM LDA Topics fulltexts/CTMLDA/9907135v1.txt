abstract:
we have shown that self interaction eects in massive quantum electrodynamics can lead to
the formation of bound states of quark antiquark pairs. a current-current fermion coupling
term is introduced, which induces a well in the potential energy prole. explicit expressions of
the eective potential and renormalized parameters are provided.

in a recent letter [1] abdalla and banerjee have discussed the connement and screening
problems in three dimensional qed. they have studied the inter-quark potential between two
static test charges in a theory of dynamical fermions of mass m coupled to electromagnetism.
their results indicate that for small separation, the quantum potential tends to the classical
logarithmic coulomb potential. however, for large distance the potential tends to zero. this
shows quite conclusively the conning and screening nature of the potential. these results also
corroborate the two dimensional results [2] nicely.

the present letter is aimed at studying the stability of the above scenario, in three dimen-
sions, in the presence of self-interaction among the fermions. in particular, we have chosen the
well studied current current thirring interaction. when the thirring coupling g is positive,
the new model shows a marked departure of a qualitative nature from [1] in the short distance
regime. in the potential prole, there appears more structure, in the form of a well, indicating
a strong repulsion below some critical distance. this might lead to stable bound states of the
quark antiquark pair. the large distance behaviour shows the expected screening. for negative
g, nothing of the above dramatic nature occures, albeit the potential decreases more sharply
for short distance.

we formulate the problem along the lines of [1]. the fermion modes in the gauged thirring
model are integrated out to incorporate quantum (fermion loop) eects in the subsequent clas-
sical analysis. this bosonization is done in the large m approximation. the auxiliary eld b,
introduced to linearize the thirring term, is next integrated, resulting in a generalized maxwell
chern simons gauge theory [3] [4]. the theory now contains two independent parameters, m
and g. in order to gain further insight, we expand the results in powers of g and keep terms
up to o(1/m, g, g2, g/m). surprisingly, the terms linear in g does not alter the results very
much whereas eect of the higher order corrections is substantial, as mentioned earlier. this
is our main result.

the ideas of screening and connement play a central role in gauge theory. the computa-
tional hurdles in four dimensions compel us to study the lower dimensional models. but one
has to extract results which are not artefacts of low dimensionality and can be carried on to the
real world. previously, in two dimensional qed, [2] obtained results indicating screening and
connement for massless and massive fermions respectively. qcd was studied by [5], where
apart from the dynamical fermion mass, the representations of the dynamical fermions and
test charges became important. the problems regarding -vacuum, screening, connement and
chiral condensate in two and three dimensional qcd were discussed in [6].

here a = a  a, j is an external conserved current and conventionally one takes
p = 1/e2, q = /(2e2). we have considered them arbitray to keep track of them. the above
model is rewritten with the auxiliary eld b as

where  = 1/(8) and a = 1/(6m). the above lagrangian is quadratic in b and after a
formal integration of it, we get the gauge invariant eective action,

z(a) = z d(a)exp(i/4)[2e2a

lorentz gauge is adopted in dening (3). this is a generalized maxwell chern simons type of
theory [7, 4, 3]. for g = q = 0, this action reduces to the one in [1]. from the a equation of
motion, it follows that a = 0. let us from now on work with the truncated version of this
model keeping only terms of o(a, g, g2, ag ). the a-equation in lorentz gauge is

p a + q2a + j = 0,

(5)

p = 2e2[( + q)  8(22g2  ag)(1 + q)2]; q = e2[(42g  a  p) + 2p(22g2  ag)2].

the above equation can be rewritten as [1]

(2 + (

p

)2)(a) =

p

j .

for  = 2 in the static case, (6) reduces to

(2 + (

p

)2)a0 =

1
q

j0.

(6)

(7)

this equation is inverted to get a0. we now proceed exactly as in [1]. the potential energy
between two external static charges, (emerging from j0), a distance l apart, is

v (l) = (lq  l0) = q[a0(x1 = l/2, x2 = 0)  a0(x1 = l/2, x2 = 0)].

(8)

the subscript q denotes the presence of the external charge q. solving the a-equation for a0
we get

a0(x) = q1[(x1 + l/2, x2; n)  (x1  l/2, x2; n)]

+ q2ii[(x1 + l/2, x2; n)  (x1  l/2, x2; n)].

(9)

(x, m) is the two dimensional euclidean feynman propagator given by the modied bessel
function

(x, m) = 1/(2)k0(mq(x1)2 + (x2)2).

here q1 and q2 and n are related to the external charge q and the fermion mass m. once again
for g = q = 0 we get back the results of [1]. the interesting term is the latter one in (7) which
disappears if only o(a, g) terms are kept. because of the derivative operator, it radically alters
the functional form of a0, even though its strength q2 is much less than q1. for small separation
l, k0(l)  ln(l) and the second term  1/l2, which competes and nally dominates over the

rst term. this is one of our main results. finally the potential energy function is expressed
in terms of dimensionless variables m  e2/m, g  ge2,   /e2, x = e2l as

this constitues our main result.

notice that  does not play any signicant role in the present context and so we put  = 0. in
figure (1), for m = 0.1, g = 0.1, vcl, vab and v 
t h are plotted. for this case, the potential
well in v t hp (g = +0.1) is at x  2qg2/(322) + gm/(6)  0.046 and for x < 0.003,
v t hp becomes positive. v t hn(g = 0.1) shows a sharper descent at short distance. figure
(2) shows only o(g) corrections to the vab result. the fact that vt h  vab up to o(g) is
quite insensitive for a wide range of values of g and m. here, an unrealistic value g = 50 is
chosen just to separate the vt h and vab lines as well as to stress the stability of this formulation
up to o(m, g). the shift of vt h with respect to vab in the upward or downward direction
direction is dictated by the sign of g.

up to o(m, g) the eective mass of the gauge particle a and the renormalized charge q2

let us summarise our results. the potential energy between the external charges at large
distance is screened as the gauge particles aquire mass from the chern simons term. without
the thirring interaction, at short distance, one gets a decreasing negative potential, logarithmic
in nature. the positive thirring coupling term introduces a sort of centrifugal barrier in the
eective potential, which leads to the potential well formation. expressing the centrifugal term
as (angularmomentum)2/(2ml2) shows clearly that only the thirring term contributes to
the correction in the angular momentum of the bound state. the physical reason is the
following. from (2), notice that b/g is identied as the fermion current [4]. the vector nature
of the interaction leads to the derivative-term upon integration, which subsequently changes
the angular momentum. estimates of eective mass of the state can be obtained from harmonic
oscillator excitations around the well minimum.
