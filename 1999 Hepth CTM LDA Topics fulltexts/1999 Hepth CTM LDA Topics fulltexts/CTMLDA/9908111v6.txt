harmonic scale transformation in eective qfts with underlying structures

jifeng yang

new equations governing the scale transformation behaviors of a qft with underlying struc-
tures are derived. these equations, with their several equivalent versions, can yield some new and
signicant insights and results that are dicult to see in the conventional renormalization programs.
among the several equivalent versions, one is similar to the usual callan-symanzik equation and
renormalization group equation but with dierent meanings. from another version, the anomalous
equation of energy-momentum tensor trace can be easily obtained. it can be shown that with the
new versions one could partially x the scheme dependence and hence some renormalization schemes
like momentum space subtractions are questionable. the asymptotic freedom for qcd is easily re-
produced at one-loop level in our new version cse. finally the decoupling theorem a la appelquist
and carazzone are discussed within our strategy.

i. introduction

according to the standard point of view, the qfts beset with uv unphysical divergences could be seen as cor-
responding to the eective sectors of the well-dened and complete underlying theory without uv (as well as ir)
troubles. the present qfts are just ill-dened formulations of the well-dened sectors in the underlying theory. from
this point of view we proposed a natural strategy for calculating radiative corrections without introducing ad hoc
regularizations and uv divergences [1].

in this report, we will derive the equations governing the scale transformation behavior of the qfts with the
existence of underlying structures for making the uv (to focus on the main topic we assume from now on the ir
ends are ir regular) ends of the eective qfts well-dened. our derivation does not require anything about the
renormalizability as will be clear below. thus the equations obtained are valid for all qfts as long as they are
consistent and/or physically relevant. for the renormalizable cases, the new equations are just new versions of the
conventional callan-symanzik equations [2].

this paper is organized in the following way: in section two we derive the equations governing the scale behavior of
an arbitrary qft with underlying structures to make it uv (and ir) well dened. the callan-symanzik (cs) equation
is given in several equivalent versions in section three. the anomalous trace equation of the energy-momentum tensor
follows naturally. in section four, we will elaborate on the harmony revealed by the new scale wt identities and its
implications for the conventional renormalization schemes. the scheme dependence of the decoupling theorem `a la
appelquist and carazzone [3] is discussed in section ve in the underlying theory point of view. in section six we
summarize our presentation.

ii. underlying structures and scale anomalies

before starting the derivation, we briey review our strategy and its consequences: suppose that the complete and
well-dened underlying theory is found, then it must contain certain additional parameters or constants characterizing
the correct uv structures underlying the present qfts. the latter can be now formulated without any (uv) ill-
denedness in the underlying theory. as the underlying structures are too small comparing to the scales of the eective
theories, the latter are eectively dened in the limit that the underlying structures vanish. but this does not mean
that the underlying structures are totally decoupled. on the contrary, as pointed out in ref. [1], the underlying
structures do inuence the eective theories through certain agent constants that are not included in the present
qft formulations. the well-dened formulation of the qfts are in fact dened in terms of by the canonical model
constants of qfts and the agent constants. there is no room in our proposal for divergence and counter terms.
hence the meaning of all the nite constants in our proposal is dierent from the conventionally renormalized ones.
now let us begin our derivation. consider a general complete vertex function (or a 1pi green function),
(n)([p], [g]; {}) given in the underlying theory with [p], [g] denoting the external momenta and the lagrangian
couplings (including masses) and {} denoting the underlying parameters or constants. now it is easy to see that
any well-dened vertex function must be a homogeneous function of all its dimensional arguments, that is

(n)([p], [dg g]; {d }) = d

(n) (n)([p], [g]; {})

(1)

1

where d refers to the canonical scale dimension of a parameter or canonical mass dimension of a constant (eective
and/or underlying).

in the limit (l{}) that the underlying structures vanish, there will necessarily arise some well-dened agent

constants {c} [1], then eq.(1) becomes

(n)([p], [dg g]; {dc c})  l{}(n)([p], [dg g]; {d })

= d

(n) (n)([p], [g]; {c})  d

(n) l{}(n)([p], [g]; {}).

(2)

where it is understood that even the smallest mass scale of the underlying constants is innitely large for all the scales
appearing in the eective sectors (masses, couplings or typical energy scales). note that these constants only appear
in the loop diagrams of certain vertex functions or in the pure quantum corrections. the limit operation will lead to
a local part of certain vertex functions with their coecients as functions of the agent constants c and the lagrangian
constants 1. in all the following deductions, it is understood that for any equation derived in the underlying version
((; {})) there is a parallel version dened in terms of the agent constants {c}. let us work in the underlying version
rst.

now the dierential equation version of eq. (1) reads

n

{

xi=1

pi  pi +x dggg +x d  d(n) }(n)([p], [g]; {}) = 0.

(3)

all the scale or mass dimensions are canonical here. obviously the constants with zero canonical mass dimensions do
not cause any violation of the scale behavior. eqs. (1) to (3) are valid for any qft provided they are mathematically
consistent and/or physically eective. renormalizability is simply not in concern here.
it is clear that the scale
anomalies are caused by the indispensable existence of the underlying structures.

note that the operation dggg in the above equations inserts certain local operators into the vertex function under
consideration, which is in turn equal to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor () for the qfts in concern (it is
an easy exercise to check this). thus we arrive at the following,

n

{

xi=1

pi  pi +x d  d(n) }(n)([p], [g]; {}) = i(n)

 ([0; p], [g]; {})

(4)

eq.(3) or equivalently eq.(4) is just the most general underlying structure version of the ward-takahashi identity
for scale transformation in (eective) qfts. the anomalies in the eective qfts are canonical behaviors in the
underlying theory point of view as the underlying constants {} are featuring constants there. the parallel equation
of eq. (3) in terms of the agent constants {c} that can be derived from eq.(2) read

n

{

xi=1

pi  pi +x dccc +x dggg  d(n) }(n)([p], [g]; {c}) = 0.

(5)

eqs. (3), (4) and (5) are valid not only order by order but also graph by graph.
it is very clear that the agent
constants, which arise obviously from the limit operation l{}, take over all the responsibilities originally held by the
underlying structures {}. they are inherent in the well-dened forms of the qfts. they reside not in
the tree graph section of the theories but only in the pure quantum loop graphs.

now we note the following obvious fact: since the agent constants are arguments of the coecients (co;([g]; {c}))
of the local part of certain vertex functions loop graph (denoted as ) due to the limit operation, the variations in
these agent constants nally lead to the insertions of the local vertex operators ([o]). some of these composite vertex
operators are just given by the lagrangian. then the insertion of some of these operators can be realized through
the variation with respect to the couplings in the lagrangian (the insertion of the kinetic terms and others that can
not be found in the lagrangians will be generally denoted as ion ). that is, with the following facts valid for the
complete vertex functions,

1here the notation c takes a dierent meaning in contrast to ref. [1] where we use c to denote just the denite coecients of
the local part of a vertex function. later we will denote the coecients of the local vertices as {c}.

{ + x{co; }
{ + x{on }
here the insertion of the kinetic vertex of a eld  is denoted as i.  or dc denote the coecients before the
inserted composite operators. (a vertex functions dependence upon the agent constants is eected through the local
coecient constants after the vertical bar.) eq.(10) is true order by order, graph by graph while eq.(11) is only true
for the complete sum of all graphs (or sum up to a certain order). the constants {c} must satisfy all the above
equations as functions of the agent constants and the model constants that are classically dened. thus one can view
the above equations as constraints imposed by the most natural facthomogeneityupon these constants. now the
anomalies are dened by the  functions in front of the insertion operators.

(10)

(11)

although in eq.(11) we have rewritten some of anomalies in terms of the insertions of the composite operators
appearing in the lagrangian, they are specifying the scale behaviors of the theoriess quantum structures, not
that of the classical constants. in fact they describe the inuences of the normal scale behaviors of the underlying
structures upon the eective qfts. later, in section four, we will discuss more closely about this point followed by
some signicant consequences which have not been achieved in the conventional renormalization programs.

iii. new versions of callan-symanzik equation and rge

in this section we limit our attention to a special type of theories where there is no variations in certain local vertices

the lagrangian operators. in conventional terminology, we consider in this section only renormalizable theories.

(those denoted by p dcn cn cn or p{on } on ([g]; {c}) ion in eq.(9)) that can not be realized through insertions of
without the variations necessarily described by p dcn cn cn , eqs. (10) and (11) should take the following form,
{ +x dggg + x{cl}
{ +x(g + dg)gg +x  i  d(n) }(n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0,

dclclcl  d(n) }(n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0,

(13)

(12)

these are just some new versions of the cs equations for renormalizable theories. before turning them into more
familiar forms,let us rst make the following remarks.

as pointed out in section two, the most striking dierence between [g] and {c} is that the former are dened in the
tree level vertices while the latter only appear in loop amplitudes. the classical constants [g] or the tree level
vertices alone can not yield a well-dened denition of the quantum structures of elds for theories with potential
uv divergence. but the incompleteness of the constants [g] or the unavailability of {} by now does not mean that
there must be divergence. of course among {} or their agents {c} that characterize the quantum paths, there
must be ones with mass dimensions specifying the eective quantum motions scale(s). in our opinion, this is the
physical basis of the necessary appearance of a mass or energy scale in any regularization/renormalization scheme. in
our strategy, these scales naturally appear in the course of indenite integrations.

on the other hand, the locality of the appearance of these quantum agents does allow a mix among [g] and the agent
constants (through {c([g]; {c})}) for the complete vertex functions or their generating functional in renormalizable
theories. suppose there are scale transforms in the agent constants, then

3

x{c}
= {x[g]

dccc(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})}) = x{c}
ggg +x{}

 i}(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})})

dccc (n)(   |{c([g]; {c})})

which is equivalent to

{x{c}
= {x{c}

dccc  x{c}
dccc x[g]

ggg x{}

dccc}(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})})

 i}(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})}) = 0.

(14)

(15)

it is easy to see that the invariance in eq.(15) is in fact a rearrangement of the classically dened parts and that
arising from quantum loops or a tautology of the fact that agent constants changes only aect the elementary like
local vertices as evident in eq.(14). this is our new version of the renormalization group equation.

now let us turn the kinetic terms contribution into other forms. this can be achieved by noting that the coecient
constants in the kinetic vertices only renormalize or rescale the line momenta in the graphs. for example, for the
fermions, this is just the rescaling of ip/  (1 + c)ip/. similarly for bosons, ip2  (1 + c)ip2. since the lines must
end up in various vertices, such rescaling of lines would eectively lead to the rescaling of vertices and be shared by

the latter in pairs. thus a vertex is typically rescaled as qi(1 + ci)1/2qj(1 + cj )1/2 depending on the number of

line momenta that join it. for an n-point 1pi vertex function there must be n external momenta ow into or out of
a number of elementary vertices in the graphs. as the external momenta are not subject to the rescaling there must
be compensated rescaling for these vertices containing external momentaan overall rescaling of the complete n-point
vertex functions. thus we have

g  g  (g  ng;


2

 ng;


2

), dg = 0; g  g  (g  or), dg 6= 0;

(n,n)  (1 + c)n/2(1 + c)n/2(n,n).

then the above equations take the following forms:

{ +x(g + dg)gg + n
ggg  n
{x{c}

dccc x[g]


2

2

 n

+ n

 d(n ,n ) }(n,n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0,


2

}(n,n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0.
2

(16)

(17)

(18)

one can see that eqs.(17) and (18) take exactly the same form as the usual cse and rge. but we must emphasize
again here that everything here is given in terms of the classical constants [g] and agent constants. one might take
the [g] as our nite bare constants.

now some remarks are in order:
(1). each equation is given in terms of the classically dened constants [g] and the quantum agents denitely
dened in the complete underlying theory, no divergence and hence no innite renormalization is needed.
in the
conventional schemes, divergence is inevitable due to the articiality of the regularization methods and hence innite
renormalization is necessary. then after subtraction, one needs to reidentify the originally classically dened
constants with a product of two singular objectsbare quantities and the renormalization constants.

(2). conventionally, the innite bare quantities are in fact regularization scheme dependentdierent divergence
in dierent schemes, therefore scheme dependence is inherent there as innite renormalization only transforms the
expressions not the essence. in the underlying theory point of view this problem is due to the articiality of the
regularization schemes for simulating the true underlying structures 2. there should be only one physical scheme, the

2conventionally, it is believed that the scheme dependence is only inherent in the perturbative truncations but not in the full
renormalized theory, basing on the expectation that the low energy theories are independent of the short distance structures
and hence independent of regularization schemes. this is not correct as even the underlying constants do not show up in the
eective theory, they do aect the eective theories through their agent constants. the scale anomalies are just the evidences
of the inuences of the underlying structures. otherwise, why bother choosing among regularizations?

one with the true agent constants selected by the nature together with the classically dened lagrangian constants
apart from some redenition freedom for the special type theories described in eqs. (14), (15) or (18).

let us take qed as an example for demonstration.
the cs equation and rge in conventional renormalization schemes read respectively [4]

{ + (1 + mr)mrmr  r + naa  n + d(na ,n ) }(na,n)([p], mr, r) = 0;
{  mrmrmr + r  naa  n}(na,n)([p], mr, r) = 0.

(19)

(20)

while to write down our new version cse and rge for qed we need to be specic on the following aspects: among
the agent constants there is at least one mass scale parameter, we will denote it as  and parametrize all the agents
into one mass scale and a series of constants {ci;0} with zero mass dimension so that the coecients take the following
form

cm = cm(m, e; ) + cm;0({ci;0}), ce = ce(m, e; ) + ce;0({ci;0}) = c, . . . .

(21)

where the ward-takahashi identity for gauge invariance is used. then from eqs.(12) to (18) we can write down our
new cse and rge in several equivalent versions as follows

{ + mm + dcmcmcm + dcacaca + dc cc  d(na ,n ) }(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c})
= { + (1 + m)mm + eee + a ia +  i  d(na ,n )}(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c})
= { + (m + 1)mm +

 d(na ,n ) }(n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c}) = 0;

ee + na

+ n

{  dcmcmcm  dcacaca  dc cc }(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c})

= {  mmm 

e
2

ee  n


2

 n


2

}(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c}) = 0.

(22)

(23)

now we can compare our new cse and rge in (22) and (23) with the conventional ones in (19) and (20). the
anomalies are all described in our equations in terms of the classical constants m, e or () and the agents , c, while
in the conventional renormalization schemes the anomalies are given in terms of the renormalized constants mr, r
depending on an arbitrary scale  via the innite renormalization constants. to the lowest order the correspondence
should be

mr  m  (m  ); (r) = 2a  a  2e; 2  .

(24)

we note again that the equations expressed in terms of the coecient constants directly are valid order by order and
graph by graph as well as for the complete sum or sum up to a certain order while the ones given in terms of vertex
insertions are only valid for the complete sum or sum up to certain order (so it is with the conventional cse and
rge).

from the experiences above it is also easy to derive the wt identity of scale transformation for generating functional

of vertex functions of a qft from homogeneity,

z ddx[d  x  x)(x)]
z ddx[d  x  x)(x)]

{x{}
= {x{}



(x)

+x[g]
+x[g]

dggg +x{c}
(dg + g)g +x{}



(x)

dccc  d}1p i ([], [g]; {c})

 i  d}1p i ([], [g]; {c}) = 0.

(25)

with d denoting the spacetime dimension. again this is correct for any consistent qfts.

to exhibit the utility of the version in terms of the operator insertion, we simply note that once it is translated into
the operator form we get the anomalous trace equation of quantum energy-momentum tensor since all the quantum
eects all well dened here and all the eects have been given in terms of known quantum operators. thus one can
just read the trace equation from the operator insertion version of eq.(25), for qed this is simply

g = (1 + m)m  +

1
4

af f  i d = (1 + m  )m  +

1
4

af  f .

(26)

5

in the last step we have used the motion equation. considering the correspondence in eq. (24), this is exactly the
operator trace anomaly equation for qed [5] in a new version without divergence and subtractions. in unrenormaliz-
able theories, the trace anomalies would contain an innite sum of local composite operators beyond the lagrangian
operators.

in next section we will illustrate the correctness of our new wt identity or new cs equation in unconventional

versions in several examples and demonstrate their physical utility and signicance.

iv. harmony constraint on the agent constants

we have seen that vertex functions or their generating functional for a qft must be homogeneous functions
with respect to all the dimensional parameters and constants which must include the underlying structures or their
agents. that is to say, for this homogeneity to be valid in a well-dened formulation the underlying structures
are indispensable. therefore in the underlying theory point of view the scale transform is in perfect harmony in
the following sense: when all the arguments scale up together according to their normal scale or mass dimensions
the vertex functions(functional) must then exhibit exact scale behaviors. this is the harmony principle we wish to
advocate that is understandable only in terms of underlying structures.

this harmony leads to a natural explanation for the scale or trace anomaly. on the one hand, in the underlying
theory formulation, there is no scale anomaly. the scale behavior is denite and normal there.
in the rescaling
of all elds and all constants, there should be generally transformations into each other (just like any symmetry
transformation) in a denite way to preserve the overall homogeneity. then as we only eectively observe the
relatively low sectors variables and their behavior, the anomalous scale variations of the eective variables that
should be absorbed by the underlying structures variations are therefore exposed. thus it is equally correct to
interpret the anomalies as the normal contributions of underlying structures and as the anomalous behaviors of the
eective sectors that should be unambiguous in terms of the canonical variables of eective theories 3. they are the
two faces of one thing. chiral anomaly can be understood in similar way [7]. we hope this harmony principle could
be generalized to other transformation behaviors of the eective theories.

it is known in gauge eld theories that gauge invariance reduces the number of ambiguities (or the number of
independent divergences in conventional terminology). here, with the harmony notion elaborated above, further
important constraints upon the ambiguities can be imposed. this scale harmony has in fact locked the scale behaviors
of the agent constants with that of the denite parts of the eective theories and hence the ambiguities are further
reduced. now let us enumerate some examples to illustrate the validity of our new cs equations and the role of
ambiguity reduction of these equations in the notion of harmony.

let us illustrate our point of view with simple examples, i.e., the 1-loop level elementary vertices in qed: electron
self-energy (1), electron-photon vertex (1)
 and photon polarization  . for simplicity let us consider the cases of
massless electrons. as for the expressions of these objects in terms of the unknown agent constants, one can use any
regularization to compute the denite part and just leave the ambiguous local part as an ambiguous polynomial of
external momentum. or one can use the technique introduced in ref. [1] . (we will also explain this technique later.)
it is sucient to parametrize the agent constants with one dimensional constant  and a number of dimensionless
constants. then from homogeneity we nd that

(1)(p, p) = i

(1)

 (p, 0|p) = +i

(1) (p, p) = i

e2
122 (p2g  pp)[ln

e({c0})];

p2
2 + c0

a({c0})].

(27)

here all the constants are meant for 1-loop case and the superscript 0 of the constants means that these constants
are dimensionless and independent of any dimensional constants and we work in feynman gauge. then these objects
have scale anomalies in terms of canonical variables only (here only momentum)

3we had shown elsewhere [6] and will further demonstrate below that scale or trace anomaly is in fact due to the presence of
a kind of rational terms that are nonlocal (hence denite at least in 1-loop level). the presence of this kind of rational terms
is unambiguous or independent of regularization schemes. it is in this sense the anomaly is a denite property of qft.

{p  p  1}(1) = i

e2
82 p/;

{p  p}(1)

 = +i

e2
82 ;

{p  p  2}(1) = i

e2
62 (p2g  pp).

(28)

now if we include the agent constants contributions, which is  (the dimensionless agent simply do not aect
scale behavior), then we can recover the exact scale behavior or the exact scale harmony in the version with explicit
agent constants which is valid order by order, graph by graph:

{p  p +   1}(1) = 0;

{p  p + }(1)

 = 0;

{p  p +   2}(1) = 0.

(29)

this is just harmony we have explained above. the dimensional agent constant  must appear in the vertices as ln 2.
they must compensate the unambiguous anomalies from the denite and nonlocal parts. (but the other dimensionless
agent constants remain undetermined by the scale wt identities.) it is easy to see that the anomaly in each 1-loop
vertex above is due to the logarithmic dependence upon momentum which upon the action of p  p yields a local
term from a nonlocal one: (p  p) ln[p2] = p( 2p
p2 ) = 2. or if one starts with the insertion of the dilatation current
into the elementary vertices there should be an unambiguous rational term in terms of momentum only like  pp
p2
which yields a local terms after contracting with divergence operation p  pp
p2 = p. by the way, we note that
the conventional version of cse and the one in terms of vertex insertions can not hold order by order and graph by
graph but only for the complete vertex functions or sums up to certain order.

if one sums the vertices up to 1-loop level with tree graph vertices included she/he could get the vertex insertion

version as follows,

{p  p +  i  1}(1)
 = 0;
e2
82 ;

e2
82 ;

(1)

(1)
e =

{p  p + eee}(1)

e; = 0;

{p  p + a ia  2}(1) = 0;

(1)
a =

e2
62 .

(30)

(31)

it is easy to see that the anomalies are independent of mass. one can recalculate the 1-loop corrections of the
above vertices in the massive case with the technique we proposed [1]. here we just list the photon polarization case
given by chanowitz and ellis [8] but parametrize the local parts following our strategy,

 = i

e2

i }) + 6z 1

,

{p  p  2} = i + i

e2
62 (g p2  pp)

(32)

(33)

(34)

where the anomaly is exactly the same as in the massless case.

now if we include the  operation and that of the mass, there should not be any anomaly as all dimensional
arguments are harmoniously considered. thus the anomaly must be assumed up by the dimensional agents variation,
or the dimensional agent must be locked in this way with the denite anomaly,

ca(m; {, c0

i }) = 2

 ca(m; {, c0

i }) =  ln

2
m2 + ca({c0

i })

(35)

(36)

where the only dimensional constant besides the agent  is fermion mass here 4. thus we have locked the behavior
of the underlying structures acted by their agent(s). this is quite a natural conclusion following from the standard
underlying theory point of view. in a sense the harmony notion elaborated here xes the agent constants to a certain

4one can easily see the homogeneous dependence on 2
m2 by noting that if the nonpolynomial momentum dependent part has
mass to fulll the homogeneity, then the coecients must depend on mass in this way. one can also see this point by directly
solving the scale wt identity in the agent constants version, i.e., using eq. (12) or (5) that is valid graph by graph.

degree. the xation of the constants here corresponds to the subtraction procedure in the conventional renormalization
programs where the dependence of the renormalized amplitudes upon the subtraction points can be almost arbitrary.
our discussion above simply rejects all the schemes where the dependence of the residual local parts of the elementary
vertices upon the subtraction scale is dierent from that given by eq.(36) in the rst place before referring to other
problems of the schemes. this could not have been achieved in the conventional renormalization programs.

therefore according to the foregoing discussions, the subtraction schemes eected at euclidean momentum are
questionable for the massive case 5. here we must mention that the dependence on the agent constants in the way
specied in eq.(36) is conventionally subject to the nondecoupling diculty [10]. however,

this is not a real challenge by noting that the underlying formulation is correct only when the limit l{} is valid
with respect to all eective parameters including the agents. when a mass goes to innity, the expressions that have
been obtained by assuming it is nite are no longer true. we will make further discussions on this issue in section
ve.

the natural appearance of the dimensional agents in the way dictated in eq. (36) can also be technically understood
in the following way. first we need to briey review the technique we proposed solely based on the existence of
the underlying structures for providing well-dened formulations [1] as follows: for a 1-loop graph g of supercial
divergence degree g  1 [11] with its underlying version amplitude denoted as g([p], [g]; {}), we have

[p] g([p], [g]; {}) = l{}z ddk[g
[p] l{}g([p, k], [g]; {})] = z ddkgg([p, k], [g]; {}) = g

[p] l{}g([p], [g]; {}) = l{}g
g
= z ddk[g
g([p], [g]; {cg([g]; {c})}) = l{}g([p], [g]; {})  g([p], [g]; {cu

[p] g([p, k], [g]; {})]

g ([p], [g]),

g})  [g

[p] ]1g

g ([p], [g])

(37)

(38)

where g
[p] and its inverse denote the dierentiation (for  times) with respect to the external momenta (one can do
the same with respect to masses in certain cases like for tadpole graphs) and the indenite integration respectively.
we can not get the denite agent constants or the coecient constants but a set of unknown constants {cu
g} instead
in our technical treatment. eq.(37) follows from the natural assumption that the underlying structures make the
qfts well dened and the low energy limit does not alter the well-denedness.

our above analysis implies that these unknown constants are to be dened as the true agents through various
physical properties. there must be at least one constant with mass dimension among the constants {cu
g} as the result
of the indenite integration though its precise value are to be xed otherwise and it must appear in the polynomial
part of g([p], [g]; {cu
m2 where m is a mass among the model constants [g]. this can be seen by observing
that the amplitude g

g}) as  ln 2
g ([p], [g]) must take the following form (with appropriate feynman parametrization)

g

g ([p], [g])  z 1

0

[dx]f ({x})

l([p], [gm]|{x})
q([p], [gm]|{x})

(39)

with l(  ) and q(  ) denoting respectively the linear and quadratic expressions of the combination of dimensional
parameters like external momenta and masses with the help of feynman parameters {x}. then on the rst step
indenite integration with respect to the external parameters a logarithmic expression is generated with an arbitrary
mass scale entered for balancing the mass dimensions,

(40)

further indenite integrations with respect to the external parameters of mass dimension would necessarily carry on
this mass scale in the polynomial part. if one trades the  in the logarithmic function with a model mass constant
so that the nonpolynomial function of momenta only involve model mass parameters, the  would only appear in the
polynomial part in the form of ln 2
m2 just as we claimed through scale anomaly analysis. the multiplying factor of
this logarithmic function is nothing else but the anomalous dimension:([g0]). thus at 1-loop level, for all local
ambiguities, we can claim that:

5this is not to say the other schemes are totally ok. it is known that some regularization schemes like dimensional regular-
ization sometimes leads to oversubtraction and are therefore questionable in certain applications [9]. the most crucial point is
that all regularization schemes are ad hoc ones contain various ill-denedness.

the superscript 0 indicates that its principal is totally independent of any constants with nonzero mass dimension.

our technical proposal can be very naturally generalized to the multiloop cases and many conventional subtleties
like overlapping divergences are automatically resolved, please refer to ref. [1] 6. we will provide more examples of
calculations in the proposed technique in future reports, especially in the nonperturbative case where the conventional
regularization schemes often yield more severe divergences.

before closing this section we simply demonstrate that the asymptotic freedom of qcd can be easily reproduced in
our new version of cse. the new version cse for the two-point connected correlation function of gauge elds with
external legs amputed reads (a specic gauge like feynman gauge is assumed)

{ + gsgsgs +x(1 + mi)mimi  a}dc(p, gs, [mi]; {, c0
for simplicity let us work in the massless case. noting that gs is equal to  1
the cse in terms of (= g2

s /(4)), we have (ef f  dc)

j }) = 0.

(42)

according to eq. (16) and rewriting

{  a  a}dc(p, ; ) = 0 = {  a}ef f (p, ; ) = 0.

(43)

here we have simply assumed that the constants independent of any mass scale is zero or absorbed into the mass
scale. expanding ef f in terms of 1
2 ln[p2/2]), one can nd the following
relation for the expansion coecients at one loop level of (1)

n=0 fn()tn, t  1

ef f = p

the solution to eq.(44) is

fn = ann+1, n  0,

and hence the eective coupling takes the following well-known form

ef f (p2, ; ) =

(46)

the asymptotic freedom is clearly reproduced for qcd due to the negative constant a at one-loop level. the ir
landau pole in the eective coupling for qcd can not be trusted as we have worked in the uv end with ir details
coarse grained away. for qed, the landau pole is uv one (due to positive a), but it is not a nal answer before the
higher order corrections of a are included. moreover, as the energy is extremely higher, there is another problem:
the underlying structures would interfere with the eective sectors more strongly, i.e., the present qft models
must be modied somehow. this is closely related with the validity of the limit operation l{} and will be discussed
in more details in next section. hence the solution is trust worthy at energies not extremely high.

v. decoupling theorem and underlying structures

now let us turn to the decoupling issue of the heavy particles in qfts.
as we have noted in last section, due to the logarithmic dependence of the local constants (coi ) upon the particle
mass ( ln m2,see eq.(41)) these constants would diverge as the particles become extremely heavy (mh  m  )
and this in turn implies the nondecoupling of the heavy particles. while in the subtraction schemes eected at
euclidean momentum, the heavy particles contributions to the light sector vanish as the masses go to innity [3,10].

6moreover, according to this technique, the new ambiguities in the potentially divergent multiloop graphs beyond the subgraph
ambiguities must appear in the local part as ln 2
m2 . thus summing all the overall local parts associated with each graph would
2 ov ([g0]) ln{2/m2} + c 0
lead to local vertices with coecients  [1 + 1
i })]. that is the underlying structures only
renormalize the model constants [g] by simple logarithmic dependence on the masses and an agent scale.

ov ({c0

to resolve this scheme dependence of decoupling phenomenon, we note that from the underlying theory point of
view, when a physical mass or mass scale goes to innity relative to the characteristic energy scale of an eective
physical system, it means that the physics associated with this innite energy scale belongs to the uv underlying
sectors of the eective system. or the heavy particles now join the underlying structures party and the underlying
constants {} are no longer innities for such heavy particles, then the expressions containing ln 2
that have arisen
m 2
h
from the limit operation l{} is no longer valid, or equivalently, the limit operation limmh can not be directly
applied to the green functions simply because this operation would inevitably invoke the underlying structures for it
to make sense or the following commutator is not zero,

(cid:20) lim

mh

, l{}(cid:21) 6= 0.

(47)

so we must resort to the original underlying theory expressions which are well dened no matter how heavy some
elds (eective or fundamental) are. thus, when a eld becomes too heavy to be excited by the low energy interaction,
or equivalently when the energy of a system becomes so low that it crosses a heavy particle threshold, the underlying
constants for the new eective sectors now include the extremely heavy particles mass. then the limit operation
l{} now changes to l{} with

{}  {}[ {mh} = {; mh} .

(48)

these heavy particles inuences are delegated to the new agent constants that nally appear from the new limit
operation l{}. since these agents are nite in principle, the eects of the heavy particles only renormalize the
light sectors by a nite amount in the local vertices [10]. similarly, it is also easy to see that the expressions obtained
at nite momenta for qfts can not be simply extrapolated to the uv limit as it would again invalidate the limit
operation about the underlying structures. this is directly related to the asymptotic expansion of operator products
which will be discussed later in our new formalism [12].

equivalently, one can let the energy and masses of the light sectors become relatively innitesimal comparing to
the heavy sectors, then the light sectors would be again given in terms of masses and couplings belonging to the light
sectors and additional nite agent constants appearing only in the local vertices of the light elds. this is just the
spirit behind the heavy quark eld theory [10].

as the eective parameters like mass and momenta become extremely large, such elds would interact more directly
with the underlying structures. then the limit of decoupling the underlying structures for these heavy or high-energy
elds are no longer valid and one has to work in models suitable for more higher energy physics. thus the scheme
dependence of the decoupling theorem is again closely connected to the indispensable existence of the underlying
structures for making the qfts naturally well dened. the intimate relation between the decoupling theorem and
the existence of the underlying structures will be investigated intensively in the future. moreover, to make the
formulation completely well dened, the ir underlying structures should be included in all the future investigations.
conventionally, the subtraction point is deemed as arbitrary, a running scale. while in the underlying theory point
of view, due to the condition of decoupling theorem or the validity of the le limit operation, such scales (agent
constants) should be uniquely dened up to possible equivalence. one could not arbitrarily rescale any eective
parameter (like mass and energy) and any agent constant (which characterizes the quantum structures of an eective
sector in addition to the planck constant and eective parameters, see section ii and iii). once a scale is extrapolated
to a place where the eective qft models break down, the formulations in terms of the le eective parameters and
agent constants cease to be correct or useful.

vi. summary

from our discussions above, we can see that the underlying theory postulate is quite natural and powerful. many
subtle issues in conventional schemes are resolved in a natural way in our proposal [1]. the new equations governing
the scale behaviors are formulated in terms of canonical and agent constants that are well dened. the most signicant
technical prediction from our investigations here is the irrationality of certain conventional renormalization schemes.
we could also reproduce many novel results. the derivation of trace anomaly in the underlying theory approach is a
simple work.

as the scheme dependence in high energy applications of qcd is a very important issue, we hope our investigations
here could be of help to this issue. of course our main goal here has been to demonstrate the plausibility and power
of our recent proposal for renormalization, further development and applications of the proposal will be made in the

10

future. we hope our strategy could lead to more important contributions to high energy physics and beyond. the
issue of gauge dependence of the cse in gauge eld theories will be discussed in the future together with the ir
problem in such qfts.

in summary, we derived several new versions of the ward-takahashi identities of scale transformations in any qft
models along the natural strategy for dealing with the uv ill-denedness. among these new versions, each has its
own advantage and utility in dierent situations. our expressions are all free from divergences and the associated
innite renormalization. the new equations improve the conventional ones in several aspects. a most important new
result is that the nite local part of any potentially divergent vertex graph can not be arbitrary and therefore some
conventional subtraction schemes are, according to the underlying theory point of view, unreasonable choices. the
important decoupling theorem a la applequist and carazzone is argued to be still valid outside euclidean momenta
subtraction schemes with the underlying structures appropriately accounted.
