abstract

we propose a construction of non-trivial vacua for yang-mills theories
on the 3torus. although we consider theories with periodic boundary con-
ditions, twisted boundary conditions play an essential auxiliary role in our
construction. in this article we will limit ourselves to the simplest case, based
on twist in su (2) subgroups. these reproduce the recently constructed new
vacua for so(n ) and g2 theories on the 3torus. we show how to embed
the results in the other exceptional groups f4 and e6,7,8 and how to compute
the relevant unbroken subgroups. in a subsequent article we will generalise to
su (n > 2) subgroups. the number of vacua found this way exactly matches
the number predicted by the calculation of the witten index in the innite
volume.

1 introduction

when constructing gauge eld theories on a torus, a logical starting point is to
begin with the construction of the classical vacua. for a gauge theory, this means
nding all solutions with vanishing eld strength, f = 0, while respecting the
appropriate boundary conditions. for yang-mills theories the relevant equation is
non-linear, and hence non-trivial. with periodic boundary conditions, one trivial
class of solutions is easily found, one can set a = ca
 a constant, and
ha group generators in a maximal abelian algebra of the group (cartan subalgebra
(csa)). for su(n) and sp(n), all vacuum solutions are gauge equivalent to a
member of this class, but in general this turns out not to be the case.

ha with ca

this problem is of relevance for the calculation of the witten index, tr(1)f in
4-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories (where f stands for fermion number,

and the trace is over the hilbert space). in a classic paper [1], witten proposed
to formulate the theory on t 3  r with periodic boundary conditions (for su(n),
tr(1)f was also computed on t 3  r with twisted boundary conditions, but this
approach cannot be applied to a general group). the expectation is, that for a
suciently small size of the torus, a semiclassical calculation will be reliable. the
energy spectrum is discrete, the vacua are distinct, and their contribution to tr(1)f
can in principle be counted. based on the above mentioned trivial class of solutions,
witten predicted tr(1)f = r + 1 for theories with a simple gauge group, where
it is argued that tr(1)f is invariant under
r is the rank of the gauge group.
a large class of perturbations, and one can ask the question whether this result
can be reproduced in the innite volume limit, the theory on r4. in the innite
volume, the gauge theory exhibits chiral symmetry breaking via the axial anomaly,
and, assuming gluino condensation, one nds h distinct vacua [1, 2] (h is the dual
coxeter number, which is equal to the dynkin index of the adjoint representation, in
an appropriate normalisation). the argument therefore suggests that h = r + 1 for
simple gauge groups. this equality involves two purely group-theoretical quantities,
and is easily checked. one nds that the equality is satised for the unitary and
symplectic theories, but not for the theories based on orthogonal or exceptional
gauge groups.

a resolution to this paradox was oered in [3]. using an m-theory construction,
witten was able to show that in so(n) with n  7, at connections exist which are
not of the trivial type. these non-trivial at connections give an extra contribution
to tr(1)f of r + 1 where r is the rank of the subgroup that is unbroken by the
holonomies (wilson loops along the non-trivial cycles of the torus). on the basis of
his analysis witten suggested that

h =xi

(ri + 1)

(1)

where the sum runs over disconnected components of moduli space, i.e. dierent
classes of solutions, and ri is the rank of the unbroken gauge group in each of these
components. for su(n) and sp(n), the moduli space has only one component,
and (1) reduces to the old formula. for the orthogonal groups, the extra vacua of
witten make up a second component in moduli space, and the result satises the
equality (1). witten conjectured that extra solutions might also solve the problem
for the exceptional groups. indeed, for g2, it was shown in [4] that an extra vacuum
exists, and (1) is satised. we will describe a method that allows us to address the
question for the other exceptional groups.

the methods involved so far to nd extra vacua rely heavily on the properties
of orthogonal groups [3, 4]. the g2 case is solvable because of the relation of
g2 to so(7).
in this paper, a more systematic way of constructing non-trivial

2

vacua will be discussed. the existence of extra vacua in g2 and so(n) will be
linked to the fact that these groups have special subgroups. this allows us to
reconstruct the holonomies explicitly. our construction can easily be embedded in
the exceptional groups f4 and e6,7,8.
in this paper we will restrict ourselves to
the simplest realisation of our construction, based on twist in su(2)-subgroups.
this will be sucient to reproduce the previous results from [3, 4] for g2 and the
orthogonal groups. in a subsequent article [5] we will show that constructions with
twist in su(n)-subgroups (with n > 2) can be realised in the other exceptional
groups (and only in these). although we do not know how to prove whether our
method gives a complete classication of the at connections for exceptional gauge
groups on t 3, a strong indication that this is the case, is the fact that (1) is satised
when the new vacua are included.

the outline of this paper will be as follows. in section 2 we will introduce our
methods, and some machinery. in the next section we will apply our construction
to nd the new vacua, and calculate the unbroken gauge group. in an appendix
we briey review lie algebras of simple lie groups to outline our conventions. in a
subsequent article [5] we will construct more vacua for the exceptional groups, and
demonstrate how the witten index problem is solved. these results are summarised
in two tables.

2 non-trivial at connections

2.1 holonomies and vacua

for any at periodic connection on a torus, one can dene a set of holonomies,
wilson loops along nontrivial cycles of the torus,

k = p exp(cid:26)iz lk

0

ak(x)dxk(cid:27) ,

(2)

where k = 1, 2, 3 labels the holonomy corresponding to the cycle wrapping around
the x, y, z direction respectively, lk is the length of the cycle.

the fact that the connection is at will imply that the holonomies commute.
if one is only working with elds that take values in a representation of the gauge
group that does not faithfully represent the center (implying that the representation
is not simply connected), it is possible to impose commutativity up to an element
of the center [6]. working in a representation of the group that is simply connected,
one can easily distinguish between commutativity, and commutativity up to a center
element (twisted boundary conditions). we mention these points because twisted
boundary conditions will form an essential ingredient in what follows, although in a

3

somewhat unexpected way. as shown in [4], the fact that holonomies commute in a
simply connected representation, is sucient for the existence of a corresponding at
connection. thus, we can use the holonomies (2) to characterise the at connections.
under periodic gauge transformations, the holonomies transform covariantly
(k = gkg1), and hence their traces are gauge invariant. for the trivial class
of solutions a = ca
khalk) are on the so-called
maximal torus (obtained by exponentiating the csa). to nd a dierent solution,
one has to nd holonomies that commute, but do not lie on a maximal torus. the
corresponding at connections are no longer of a simple form in these cases.

ha, the holonomies k = exp(ica

for t 2, using the complex structure on the 2-torus, it is possible to prove (as
sketched in a footnote in [3]) that the moduli space of at connections is connected,
and hence the trivial class is the only class of solutions . for t 3 this is not the case,
but using the result for t 2 one can arrange that any two out of the three holonomies
are exponentials of elements of the csa. the third holonomy is therefore the crucial
one: either it can be written as the exponent of an element of the csa, and we have
a trivial solution, or it cannot, and one has a non-trivial solution.

the local parameters of the moduli space can be found by perturbing the holo-
nomies k around a solution, demanding they still commute (so that the perturba-
tions also lead to admissible vacua). an innitesimal perturbation of the holonomy
looks as follows (with t a the group generators)

k = k(1 + ia

kt a)

when we require that all k still commute, this implies the conditions [4]

a
kk[t a, l] = a

l l[t a, k]

(3)

(4)

if there are generators t a that commute with each of the k, this equation does not
lead to any restrictions on the corresponding a
k, and these generators correspond
to admissible perturbations. they will generate a group which is unbroken by the
holonomies, and this is the group that is relevant in the calculation of tr(1)f . we
now show that the generators that do not commute with all holonomies correspond
to global gauge transformations, for k based on the su(n) subgroup construction
to be described (for n > 2 see ref. [5]). from this construction it follows that one
can choose a basis t a for the lie algebra such that

ad(k)t a = kt a1

k = exp(i

equation (6) implies that a is independent of k, whereas (4) implies a
[k, t a] = 0, so we can write

k = 0 if

ia

kkt a = ia[k, t a].

(8)

we are thus left with a global gauge transformation, generalising a result derived in
[4] for so(7).

2.2 method of construction

our construction is based on a variant of the so-called multi-twisted boundary con-
ditions, as considered rst in [7] involving subgroups of the gauge group.

we restrict ourselves to yang-mills theories with a compact, simple and simply
connected gauge-group g. we will be interested in subgroups p gn whose universal
 is the product of n factors g. the representation of p gn will in
covering ]p gn
general not be irreducible, nor are its irreducible components in the same congruence
class.

the global structure of our subgroup p gn will not be that of a direct product
group. for the realisation of twisted boundary conditions, it is necessary that a non-
trivial discrete central subgroup has been divided out; for multi-twisted boundary
conditions this discrete central subgroup is diagonal. as a relevant example of such
a subgroup, consider so(4) which is locally su(2)su(2), but has global structure
(su(2)  su(2))/z2, where z2 is the diagonal subgroup in the z2  z2 centre of
su(2)  su(2).
for the discussion here we will restrict ourselves to a subgroup p g2 (with uni-
versal covering g2), since the generalisation to p gn will be obvious. we assume
that g allows a non-trivial center z, and that the global subgroup p g2 is a repre-
sentation of ( g  g)/zdiag where zdiag = z is the diagonal subgroup of the centre
z  z of g2. now select two elements p1, q1 generated by the lie algebra of the
rst g factor ( g1), and two elements p2, q2 generated by the lie algebra of the
second g factor ( g2), such that they commute up to a non-trivial element of the
center z of gi:

p1q1 = z1q1p1
p2q2 = z2q2p2

5

(9)
(10)

for irreducible representations of gi, zi is a root of unity, for a reducible represen-
tation zi is a diagonal matrix, with on the diagonal the center elements appropri-
ate for the dierent irreducible components. since we only deal with representa-
tions of ( g  g)/zdiag, z1 and z2 are actually elements of the central subgroup
(z  z)/zdiag = z . by picking pi and qi in a specic way, we can thus arrange
that (9, 10) are satised with the additional condition

z1 = (z2)1  z

q = q1q2  p q = qp

(11)

(12)

we now have

p = p1p2

it is possible2 and convenient to embed the p g2 subgroup in such a way that its
maximal torus t  is a subgroup of a maximal torus t of g. if the p g2-subgroup
has the same rank as g, then the tori t and t  coincide. if this is not the case, then
there are multiple ways to extend t  to a maximal torus t of g.

we can choose the elements p1 and p2 to lie on the torus t . since the maximal
torus is abelian, it immediately follows that neither q1 nor q2 is on t , and neither
is their product q (since q does not commute with either of the pi). we will now
construct a third element p  by twisting one of the gs with respect to the other
g

p  = qn

1 p qn

1 = qn

1 p1qn

2 p2qn

2 = znp

1 p2 = p1qn

(13)
we can dene a set of holonomies by setting 1 = p , 2 = p  and 3 = q. we
will always assume p  and p to be dierent, which is essential for nding non-trivial
vacua. this limits n to a nite set, since there exists some n for which zn = 1.
we also should not allow z to be an element of the centre of g, since this will also
imply that the connection dened by the holonomies p , p  and q is trivial (we can
arrange that p and q are on a maximal torus of g, and then, since the centre of
g is also on this maximal torus, p  must be on this maximal torus). since p is on
the maximal torus t , and z is an element of the centre of p g2, and the center is
generated by the csa, p  is on the maximal torus t . by assumption the torus t 
is contained in a maximal torus t of g. to dene a non-trivial at connection q
should not be on any maximal torus t of g. if q is on a maximal torus of g, then
the maximal abelian subgroup that commutes with p , p  and q is a maximal torus.
since the construction involves subgroups g with a non-trivial center, one may
always take a subgroup of g that is a product of unitary groups3. henceforth,
2it was proven by dynkin [8] that if a lie algebra lg has a subalgebra lg, then the csa
of l
g can be chosen to be contained in the csa of lg (by applying a suitable automorphism of
lg). upon exponentiation, one nds that the maximal torus of the group g, generated by lg,
is contained in the maximal torus of the group g, generated by lg.
3if some simple subgroup with non-trivial center is not su (n ), its center is either z2 (sp(n),
so(2n + 1) and e7), z4 (so(4n + 2)) , z2  z2 (so(4n)) of z3 (e6). in these cases the center is
contained in an su (2), su (4), su (2)  su (2) or su (3)-subgroup

6

we shall allways assume g to be a product of su(n)s. thus we may take g =
su(n1)n1  su(n2)n2     (ni dierent, ni positive integers), which has as center
(zn1)n1  (zn2)n2    .

2.3 diagonal subgroups

although not strictly necessary, extremely useful for our calculations is the concept
of a diagonal subgroup.
it is possible to construct a diagonal subgroup d (with
universal covering d = g) in p gn as follows: construct a lie algebra l for g,
consisting of elements t a. then the lie algebra for (p gn has the structure l1 
l2  ln with each of the li = l. hence we can write t a
i , for the generator from
li that corresponds to t a under an isomorphism mapping l to li. the diagonal
subgroup of p gn is then constructed by taking as generators t a
2 +    + t a
n .
this construction is not unique, there are many isomorphisms from li to l, and
these will give dierent (but isomorphic) diagonal subgroups.

1 + t a

we now take p1, p2, q1, q2 as before. the pi are elements of the maximal torus of
gi, so we can write pi = exp(ihi) with hi an element of the csa of li, and similarly
qi = exp(iei) with ei not in the csa. the elements p = p1p2 = exp(i(h1 + h2)) and
q = q1q2 = exp(i(e1 + e2)) are then elements of a diagonal group d, as constructed
in the above. conjugating with qn
1 = q,
which are elements of a diagonal subgroup d, isomorphic to d (the isomorphism
being given by d  qn

1 will produce qn

1 = p  and qn

1 dqn

1 ).

1 p qn

1 qqn

3 non-trivial vacua based on twist in su (2)

in this section we specialise to g = su(2). we will start by developing the relevant
tools for this subgroup. after that we will give an overview of groups in which
our construction can be realised. these include so(n) where the result from [3] is
reproduced, and g2, where we rederive the result from [4].

3.1 twist in su (2)

we will use the following convention for the su(2) algebra:

[l3, l+] = l+

[l3, l] = l

[l+, l] = 2l3

(14)

we have l3 = l3 and l+ = l. with these conventions the eigenvalues of l3,
(l+ +l)/2 and i(l+l)/2 are half-integers for representations that exponentiate
to su(2), and integers for representations that exponentiate to so(3).

7

in su(2) we will be looking for elements p and q such that

the standard convention is to take:

pq = qp

(15)

p =(cid:18) i

0

0 i (cid:19) = exp

i

2 (cid:18) 1

0

0 1 (cid:19)

q =(cid:18) 0 i

i 0 (cid:19) = exp

i

2 (cid:18) 0 1

1 0 (cid:19) (16)

in terms of generators this is p = exp(il3) and q = exp(i(l+ + l)/2) (when
lifted to so(3), the elements are p = diag(1,1, 1) and q = diag(1,1,1), which
commute). the commutation relations of p, q with the algebra elements are easily
determined

pl3 = l3p
pl+ = l+p
pl = lp

ql3 = l3q
ql+ = lq
ql = l+q

(17)

note that q induces the weyl reection on the root lattice. this has a nice analogon
for twist in su(n), n > 2 [5].

the elements pi will take the role of p in the above, the elements qi take the
role of q. now notice that the condition (11) implies that the diagonal group d
that contains p = p1p2 and q = q1q2 is actually an so(3) (it has a trivial
center). this can be seen as follows: the diagonal subgroup-construction provides
a homomorphism from any of the g = su(2) factors to the diagonal subgroup
d. under this homomorphism the non-trivial center element of su(2) is mapped
to the identity in d (because pi  p , qi  q, we have piqip 1
i = z 
p qp 1q1 = 1).

i q1

3.2 calculation of the unbroken subgroup

one of the issues we did not address so far is the fact that we require the holonomies
i (p , p  and q) to commute in a simply connected representation (otherwise
the theorem of [4] might not work).
in fact we will show that they commute in
any representation, which seems more general, but is equivalent to the previous
statement by the theory of compact lie groups. for the su(2)-based construction
described in this paper, a sucient condition for the commuting of all holonomies is
that d is an so(3)-group (since this will imply that p and q commute, and from
this it follows that p  and q commute. p and p  commute by construction). to
determine whether d is an so(3) subgroup, we construct its algebra.

as remarked in a footnote on 6, it is always possible to choose an embedding of
a subgroup such that its csa is contained in the csa of the group that contains

8

the subgroup, so let l3 = h for some h in the csa of g. the eigenvalues of h
are determined by taking inner products with the weights of g. we want l3 to
be an so(3)-generator, and therefore its eigenvalues should be integers. therefore
h, i should be integer for any weight . since any weight is expressible as a linear
combination of fundamental weights and simple roots with integer coecients, the
condition that l3 should have integer eigenvalues can be translated to

hi, i  z
hi, i  z

(18)
(19)

where i are the simple roots of g, and i are its fundamental weights. however,
if the rst of these two conditions is satised, then the second condition is satised

for some weights, namely those fundamental weights with i = pk qkk with qk

integer (we call these integer weights). hence the second condition only has to be
checked for what we will call non-integer weights. a list of these is contained in our
appendix.

we will want to compute products like pt p1, qt q1, where t are generators
of the group g we are working in, and p and q are as in the previous paragraph.
we will be looking at so(3)-subgroups, and the generators of g split into so(3)
representations. pt p1 is easily calculated. with l3 = h we have

php1 = h

pep1 = exp(ih, i)e

(20)

note that this implies that the generators either commmute or anticommute with
p.

there is also a nice and easy way to compute qt q1. first decompose the rep-
resentation of g into irreducible representations of so(3). in each irrep, construct
the normalised eigenvectors  of l3: l3 = . it then follows that

l3q = ql3 = q

(21)

hence we conclude q =  (where  is a phase factor). in fact, since we
are only dealing with so(3) representations of q, we know that the eigenvalues of q
should be 1 and hence q2 = 1, meaning that  = 1. moreover from ql+ = lq
we easily nd that4
(22)
so,  = +1 = , independent of , and 2 = 1. it is now trivial to construct
eigenvectors and eigenvalues for q:

(+1) = +1(+1)

 +   eigenvalue 
    eigenvalue  

+1 and
1, where j is the usual angular momentum number, related to

 = p(j  )(j +  + 1)j

(23)

4we use the condon-shortley phase convention: l+j

 = p(j + )(j   + 1)j

lj
the dimension d of the representation by j = (d  1)/2

9

now remember once more that only so(3) representations occur, meaning that
  {0,1,2, . . .}.
if the dimension of our representation is 2n + 1, then the
eigenvalue  occurs n + 1 times, and  n times. the determinant of the matrix
is then ()n2n+1 = ()n. the determinant should however be 1 since the matrix
has been obtained by exponentiating a traceless generator. hence we nd  = ()n,
and the action of q on any representation of so(3) is fully determined, and since by
assumption g splits into so(3) irreps, the action of q in g is completely determined.
most of the above is also valid for su(2)-irreps, but there are two dierences: one
nds 2 = 1, and it is not possible to determine whether  = i or i. this
ambiguity comes from the center of su(2), which we are unable to detect since
we are trying to determine q from commutation relations alone. notice that these
considerations imply that for an appropriately chosen basis of generators t of g
that (compare to (5))

pt ap1 = t a

qt aq1 = t a

(24)

3.3 realisations of the su (2)-based construction

we will now discuss the cases in which our construction actually gives a non-trivial
at connection. our conventions concerning roots and weights can be found in our
appendices. for the decomposition of groups into subgroups, use was made of [9].
although in each case our construction can be carried out in a subgroup p g2 =
so(4) , we will often take p gn with ]p gn = su(2)n where n > 2. this allows
us to choose p gn to be a regular subgroup [8], that is, the root-lattice of p gn
is a sublattice of the root-lattice of g. this gives an enormous simplication of
the calculations. our methods are not limited to regular subgroups, and we have
actually carried out our construction for several irregular embeddings, but we always
found the same results as for the regular embeddings. therefore we will describe
only constructions with regular embeddings.

3.3.1 g2

our rst example will be the non-trivial at connection in g2, described in [4]. we
will treat this example in full detail to clarify our methods. g2, being the group of
lowest rank that posseses non-trivial at connections on t 3, is the simplest from the
point of view of our construction (unlike the constructions in [3, 4] that are simpler
for orthogonal groups).

g2 posseses an so(4) = (su(2)  su(2))/z2 subgroup. the rst su(2)-factor
can be taken to be generated by h1, e1 and e1, the second one is then generated
by h1+22, e1+22 and e(1+22). we label the two su(2) factors su(2)1,2, and

(25)

(26)

the diagonal su(2) turns out to be an so(3). to check this we construct the weights
for the su(2)-representation. these are h161 + 242, i where  are the weights of
g2. however, since any weight of g2 is of the form p1 + q2, with p, q integer, it is
sucient to compute h161 + 242, 1i = 1 and h161 + 242, 2i = 0. we nd that
the weights of the su(2) are always integer, no matter what representation of g2 we
use, and hence the su(2) is actually an so(3). we nd the following decompositions
for the fundamental and adjoint irreps:
su(2)  su(2)

(30)

since ld

as in the above:

+ + ld


, q is also an element of d. constructing p  proceeds

p  = exp(ild
3 )

(31)

p , p  and q commute by construction.
it is also clear that the at connection
implied by 1 = p , 2 = p  and 3 = q is non-trivial, since the maximal torus of
g2 is simply the direct product of the tori of d and d, and q is not on either one.
to calculate the unbroken subgroup, we calculate the commutators of generators
with the is. as explained before only generators that commute with all three is
will be relevant. therefore the most ecient way to proceed is to rst compute
the commutators with 1 = p and 2 = p , since these are the easiest, and only
compute the commutator with 3 = q for those generators that commute with both
p and p .

for l3, and ld


we can use the results of section 3.2. if in this section we substitute ld

3 for l3,
and ld
for l, then it is clear we should identify p with p, and q with q. if in

section 3.2 we substitute ld
for l, then we should identify p 
3
with p, and q with q. for the commutators of the algebra with p , we use (20), with
 = 161 + 242. we nd that the csa commutes with p , and e commutes with p
only for  = 2 and  = (21 + 32). for the commutators of the algebra with
p , we use (20) with  = 81 +242, from which it follows that e with  = 2 and
 = (21 + 32) anticommute with p . hence the only generators that commute
with both p and p  are the csa-generators h.
to determine the eect of conjugation with q on these, we study the branching
of g2  so(3), where the so(3) is either d or d. we will take d, so the ladder
operators are ld
3 . we work with the generators of g2

themselves, and hence we are in the adjoint representation of g2. eigenvectors of
ld
3 )e = [h161+242, e] = h161 + 242, ie in our
conventions, and , ad(ld
3 . we can now split
the representation in irreducible components, by the standard procedure of looking
for highest eigenvalues, and then applying the ladder operators ld
to complete a

representation, constructing the orthogonal complement etc.. we nd that both
csa-generators have eigenvalue 0 in a 3 irrep of so(3). we should thus identify

3 )h = 0, h and e are eigenvectors of ld

3 are easily found, since ad(ld

and the csa-generator is ld

12

each csa-generator to 0 in a 3-dimensional representation of so(3), and using the
results of section 3.2 we nd that, since q0 = 0, qhq1 = ad(q)h = h.
the csa generators thus anticommute with q. thus there is no generator that
commutes with all i, and, as already established in [4], the vacuum implied by
these holonomies is isolated, and there is only a discrete unbroken subgroup.

finally we will give a matrix representation of the holonomies. the 7 irrep of
g2 has as its weights 0, 1 + 2, 1 + 22, 2,(1 + 2),(1 + 22),2. using
this ordering of weights, we nd:



1 = p = diag(1,1,1, 1,1,1, 1)
2 = p  = diag(1, 1,1,1, 1,1,1)

these can be brought to the form used in [4].

3.3.2 so(7)

in so(7), there exists a subgroup p g3 with gp g3 = su(2)3. the su(2)-factors
can be taken to be generated by subalgebras with elements hi, ei, with 1 =
(1,1, 0)/10 for the rst factor, 2 = (1, 1, 0)/10 for the second factor, and
3 = (0, 0, 1)/10 for the third. the diagonal subgroup is then (appropriate nor-
malisations for each generator included)

3 = 10h(1,0,1)
+ = 5e(1,1,0)/10 + 5e(1,1,0)/10 + 10e(0,0,1)/10

(33)

again this is always an so(3)-algebra, which can be easily veried by calculating

the inner products of 10(1, 0,1) with the simple roots and non-integer weights.

vector, spin, and adjoint representation branch as follows:

so(7) 

(su(2))3

 so(3)

7  (1, 1, 3)  (2, 2, 1)  2(3)  1

the set of holonomies is

)) (36)

in the vector representation, these are equivalent to the holonomies of witten [3].
there is no generator of the algebra that commutes with all three i.

two remarks are in place here. first, one might think that it is arbitrary which
of the su(2)-factors one chooses to twist (in the sense of eq. (13)). indeed, twisting
the rst factor leaving the other two the same, as in the above, will give a result
equivalent to twisting the second factor while leaving the other two. however,
twisting the third factor with respect to the other two will not work: if one tries

,

one nds

p  = exp(i10h(1,0,1)) = exp(i10h(0,0,2)) p

but, noticing that 10h(0,0,1) is a (correctly normalised) generator of an integral
su(2)-subalgebra of so(7), we easily nd exp(i10h(0,0,2)) = 1 (+1 if the so(7)-
algebra is in the same congruence class as the vector or adjoint representation, 1
if the so(7)-irrep is isomorphic to the spin representation). hence p and p  dier
only by an element of the centre of spin(7), and as explained in section 2.2, the
connection implied by setting 1 = p , 2 = p  and 3 = q is trivial.

as a second remark, we consider the inbedding of g2 in so(7). the so(7)-root di-
agram ts into a cube. to see its g2-subalgebra, project onto the plane orthogonal to
a diagonal. take as diagonal the direction (1,1, 1). the roots 2 = (1, 1, 0)/10
and 3 = (0, 0, 1)/10 will coincide under this projection (they will both project
to (1, 1, 2)/310), and we nd that the so(7) result can be understood from the
g2-result. this will be less relevant for the orthogonal groups, but important for an
understanding of the exceptional groups.

3.3.3 so(8)

in so(8), there is a subgroup p g4, with gp g4 = su(2)4. all su(2)-factors can be
taken to be generated by algebras with elements hi, ei, with 1 = (1,1, 0, 0)/12,
2 = (1, 1, 0, 0)/12, 3 = (0, 0, 1,1)/12 and 4 = (0, 0, 1, 1)/12. the diagonal

subgroup is then

3 = 12h(1,0,1,0)
ld
+ = 6(e(1,1,0,0)/12 + e(1,1,0,0)/12 + e(0,0,1,1)/12 + e(0,0,1,1)/12)

ld

(37)

it is easy to verify that this is an so(3)-algebra. vector, and adjoint representation
branch as follows:

so(8) 
8v 
28  (3, 1, 1, 1)  (1, 3, 1, 1)  (1, 1, 3, 1)

(2, 2, 1, 1)  (1, 1, 2, 2)

(su(2))4

(1, 1, 1, 3)  (2, 2, 2, 2)

 so(3)
 2(3)  2(1)

(38)

 (5)  7(3)  2(1)

because of triality, the spin-representations 8c and 8s have a branching that diers
only from the one for 8v in su(2)4 by permutations of the 2s and 1s, their so(3)-
content is the same. twist the rst factor to construct d:

(39)

3 = 12h(0,1,1,0)
ld
+ = 6(e
ld

(1,1,0,0)/12 + e(1,1,0,0)/12 + e(0,0,1,1)/12 + e(0,0,1,1)/12)

the holonomies are then constructed in the usual way (36). the unbroken subgroup
is again discrete. the projection of so(8) onto so(7) is trivial, and we nd that
we can understand the so(8)-result from the g2-result.

15

3.3.4 so(n), n > 8

it is clear that the so(7)-example and the so(8)-example can both be embedded
in so(9). notice however, that both in the embedding of the so(7)-example, and
the embedding of the so(8)-example we nd

3 = 12h(1,0,1,0) ld
ld

3 = 12h(0,1,1,0)

the vectors 12(1, 0, 1, 0) and 12(0, 1, 1, 0) are called dening vectors for d
and d, and there is a theorem by dynkin [8], that two representations of so(3)
are equivalent, if their dening vectors are equivalent. hence the so(7) and so(8)
embeddings are equivalent, and will not lead to dierent results. one nds a u(1) =
so(2) unbroken subgroup, but, as explained in [3, 4], the actual unbroken subgroup
is o(2), because of discrete symmetries that are invisible in our approach.

in a similar way, the non-trivial at connections for so(n) with n > 9 can
be constructed. for n suciently large, there are multiple ways of embedding an
su(2)m with a diagonal so(3). although we know no simple way of proving this
in our approach (their dening vectors need not be equivalent, for example), the
analysis of [3] shows that these can never lead to new results, other than an so(7)
or so(8) embedding will do. note the chain of subgroups

so(n)  so(n  1)      so(7)  g2

(40)

that shows that non-trivial at connections in so(n) can be derived from the
so(n)-subgroup g2. the connected component of the maximal unbroken subgroup
is so(n  7), as can be understood from the fact that so(n) branches into g2 
so(n  7).

3.3.5 f4

the easiest way to proceed in f4 is by using the fact that the so(7) root lattice is a
sublattice of the f4 root lattice. we can use su(2)-algebras with elements hi, ei,
with 1 = (1,1, 0, 0)/18, 2 = (1, 1, 0, 0)/18, and 3 = (0, 0, 1, 0)/18. the

two diagonal subgroups and holonomies are constructed in the standard way.

(1,1,0,0)/18 + 3e(1,1,0,0)/18 + 18e(0,0,1,0)/18

again these are found to be so(3)-algebras. the holonomies are as in (36). cal-
culating the (connected component of the) unbroken subgroup, one nds that it is
so(3). this can be understood from the branching of f4 into g2  so(3).

f4  g2  so(3)
26  (7, 3)  (1, 5)
52  (14, 1)  (7, 5)  (1, 3)

(43)

note that here it is important that our construction ts into g2. starting from
so(7) might lead to the wrong expectation that the unbroken subgroup would be
so(2), since f4 branches into so(7)  so(2).

3.3.6 e6

in e6 we use that the so(8) root lattice is a sublattice of the e6 root lattice. we

use su(2)-algebras with elements hi, ei, with 1 = (0, 1,1, 0, 0)/24, 2 =
(0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)/24, and 3 = (0, 0, 0, 1,1, 0)/24, and 4 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)/24 .

the two diagonal subgroups are:

ld

3 = l1

3 + l2

3 + l3

ld

+ = l1

+ + l2

+ + l3

3 = 24h(0,1,0,1,0,0)

e(0,0,0,1,1,0)/24 + e(0,0,0,1,1,0)/24

(44)

(45)

these are so(3)-algebras. the holonomies are as in (36). the (connected component
of the) unbroken subgroup is found to be su(3). this can be understood from the
branching of e6 into g2  su(3).

3.3.7 e7

the e6-example can be trivially embedded in e7, using that the e6 root lattice is
a sublattice of the e7 root lattice. we add a zero to the vectors and adapt the

17

normalisations.

(47)

these are so(3)-algebras. the holonomies are as in (36). the (connected component
of the) unbroken subgroup is a simple group of 21 generators. it takes a little more
work to show that it is5 sp(3) (and not so(7)). this can be understood from the
branching of e7 into6 g2  sp(3)

sp(2)/z2 = so(5)

5some would denote what we call sp(n) as sp(2n). for our conventions e.g.sp(1) = su (2),

6in the decompositions given, both 14-dimensional representations of sp(3) are present. by 14,
we denote the representation with dynkin labels (001), while 14 is the irrep with dynkin labels
(010) (the simple roots of sp(3) are ordered such that the longest one appears on the right) [9].

these are so(3)-algebras. the holonomies are as in (36). the (connected component
of the) unbroken subgroup is f4. this can be understood from the branching of e8

4 non-trivial vacua based on twist in su (n > 2)

although we will publish the computational details in a separate article [5], we
mention that our construction, with g = su(3), su(4), su(5) and su(2) su(3)
can be used for the exceptional groups other than g2. a construction based on
su(3) is possible in f4 and e6,7,8, the su(4) construction is possible in e7,8, and
e8 allows an su(5) based construction. finally, using the g2  f4 subgroup of
e8, the su(2) and su(3) constructions can be embedded simultaneously in this
group. the su(3)-construction will yield two inequivalent vacuum components,
obtained by taking n in eq.
(13) 1 or 2 respectively. the su(4) construction
yields three dierent vacuum components, but, one of these vacuum components is
already contained in the su(2)-construction described in this paper. the su(5)-
construction gives four dierent vacuum components. su(2)  su(3) gives ve
dierent vacuum components, of which one is contained in our su(2) construction,
and two are contained in our su(3)-construction, so only two vacua are new. we
will label these dierent vacua by an integer related to the centre of the appropriate
su(n) embeddings required for twisting. hence the integer is taken to be n for the
su(n) based construction, and 6 for the su(2)  su(3) construction. obviously
we reserve the label 1 for the trivial component.

the essence of the su(2) based construction is the existence of a suitable sub-
group p gn within a g2 subgroup of g. the non-trivial at connections arise
through the decomposition of g into g2  h, with h the maximal subgroup com-
it is the csa of h that determines the deformations (see the
muting with g2.
discussion below eq. (3)) of the non-trivial g2 connection as embedded in g, xing
the dimension of this connected vacuum component (rank(h)). since h commutes
with the g2 subgroup containing the holonomies, it also plays the role of the maxi-
mal unbroken subgroup, apart from some global discrete symmetries. compare the
situation to wittens d-brane construction [3].

(53)

it is this general feature that repeats itself for the su(n > 2) based constructions.
for su(3) the role of g2 is played by f4, with the embedding chain e8  e7 
e6  f4. for su(4) the role of g2 is played by e7, with chain e8  e7, and nally
for su(5) and su(2)su(3), e8 stands alone. our results are summarised in table
(1), which presents the connected component of the maximal unbroken subgroup for
each vacuum-type.

so far we have concentrated on the classical gauge elds. for a calculation
of the witten index tr()f , these should be quantised, and the fermions should
be included. the computation is essentially the same as in [1, 3]: each vacuum
component implies a unique bosonic vacuum, and fermions can be added in r + 1
ways, where r is the dimension of the vacuum component, which is equal to the
rank of the unbroken subgroup. thus each vacuum component contributes r + 1 to
tr()f . in table 2, we list r + 1, where r is the rank of the group listed in table
1. the columns labeled by 3, 4, 5, 6 contain more entrys to indicate that there is
more than one vacuum component for each type. finally, table 2 also lists the dual
coxeter number for each group. it is easy to verify that, rather miraculously, (1) is
satised.

5 conclusions

we have rederived the results of [3, 4], and embedded these results into the excep-
tional groups f4 and e6,7,8. the basic structure is contained in the exceptional group
g2, and the geometry (in a convenient gauge) is basically that of so-called multi-
twisted boundary conditions. for g2 and so(n) our methods are in some sense
complementary to those of [3, 4], some aspects are more conveniently described in
our construction, other aspects are more transparant in the original approach. for
the remaining exceptional groups an approach based on m-theory is not available
(yet).

the contributions to tr()f from the embedding of the g2 non-trivial at con-
nection in the exceptional groups f4 and e6,7,8 is still insucient to satisfy (1). the

21

generalisation of our method to su(n)m subgroups with n > 2 will allow us to
derive additional non-trivial at connections for these exceptional groups. in a sub-
sequent publication [5] we will construct these extra vacua, and demonstrate that
they can solve the witten index problem for the exceptional groups.

a lie algebras: conventions

let l be a lie algebra. the killing form is given by:
b(a, b) = tr{ad(a)ad(b)}

(54)

a cartan subalgebra h is a maximal abelian subalgebra in l. because all elements
in h commute, they can be simultaneously diagonalised. in particular, in the adjoint
representation, the eigenvectors of h are elements of the lie algebra. one can write:
(55)

[h, e] = (h)e h  h

the (h) are linear functionals on the space h, called roots or root vectors. it is
possible to associate elements of h to the functionals (h) by dening

because of linearity one has

b(h, h) = (h)

hp+q = ph + qh

(56)

(57)

the space h of linear functionals is a vector space. the roots form a (nite) subset
of this space. the set of root vectors will be denoted by . because the killing
form is symmetric and bilinear one can introduce the notation

b(h, h) = (h) = (h)  h, i

(58)

for compact lie algebras, the killing form denes an inner product on the root
space. the normalisation is determined by a self-consistency condition:

we now have

h, i = b(h, h) =x

h, ih, i

[h, e] = h, ie

22

(59)

(60)

the e are normalised such that

if  +  6= 0:

[e, e] = 2h

[e, e] = n,e+

(61)

(62)

(we will never need an explicit form of n,). hermitean conjugation acts as follows
in our conventions

h = h

e = e

(63)

one picks a (non-orthogonal) basis of roots i such that, if i, j are in this basis,
i  j is not a root. the roots of such a basis are called simple. any root is
expressible as pk ckk, where the ck are integers. we always denote simple roots
by i, where i is an index or a number. the simple roots of the compact simple lie
algebras are listed in appendix b.

because the elements of the csa h always commute, they can be simultaneously
diagonalised in any matrix representation. in a specic matrix representation (h)ij,
weights i are dened by (h)ii = h, ii for each . consequently the number of
weights of a representation is equal to its dimension. a weight  of a group is always
of the form

 =xi

nii + mii

ni, mi  z

(64)

where i are the fundamental weights, and i the simple roots. the fundamental
weights are dened from the simple roots by

2hi, ji
hj, ji

= ij

(65)

the fundamental weights are always of the form pk qkk where the qk are rational

numbers.

b lie algebras: roots and weights

for easy refence we give some quantities for the groups used in this article. our
conventions are basically those of [10], where they can be found in appendix f. for
g2, we nd it easier to work with abstract root vectors, for the orthogonal and
other exceptional groups it is more convenient to work with explicit forms for the
root vectors. we omit sp(n), since we will never need it for explicit calculations.
e8, f4 and g2 do not possess non-integer fundamental weights, and hence none are

23

listed. all fundamental weights of su(n) are non-integer, but we will not need
them, and hence they are not listed either.

we use the notation ei for the unit vector in the i-direction. inproducts h, i
that are not listed can either be obtained by h, i = h, i, or are 0. in the non-
simply laced algebras, the solid dots in the dynkin diagrams denote the shorter
roots.
