abstract

in this paper we prove that for a large and physically relevant class of
smooth complete metrics on open four-manifolds the set of l2-norms or
energies of (anti-)self-dual nite-energy g-connections is discrete where
g is a simple, connected, simply connected and compact lie group. the
proof is based on the atiyahpatodisinger index theorem.

to demonstrate our result we consider the euclidean schwarzschild
manifold. this metric is signicantly non-cylindrical hence standard tech-
niques are not applicable for the study of moduli space of instantons in
this physically important case. in this case the energy of a (anti-)self-dual
connection is an integer.

1 introduction

the studying of moduli spaces of su (2)-(anti-)self-dual connections over com-
pact, smooth four-manifolds led to a breakthrough in four dimensional geometry
in the early eighties due to donaldson, freedman, uhlenbeck and others. it is
surprising and encouraging that the key idea of this revolution is the mathe-
matical application of the deep physical concept of instantons rst considered
by quantum physicists in the seventies.

due to these results lot of mathematicians started to work in this area,
especially on compact four-manifolds using donaldson theory. compactness is
exploited many times in dealing with manifolds in order to avoid extremely
dicult analytical questions. later, open four-manifolds came in the scope of
interest as well due to taubes [10][11] and morgan, mrowka [9]. faced with
the non-trivial analytical diculties the metric on these open four-manifolds
has been chosen to be the most natural and simplest one in order to extract as
much geometric and smoothness property from moduli spaces of open manifolds
as possible. this class of metrics contains the so-called cylindrical metrics; these
metrics are compatible to the structure of the end of these open manifolds in
some sense.

however, it is natural to ask what about the instanton structure of physically
interesting riemannian four-manifolds? to understand the role of instantons in

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

quantum eld theories it is important to study these manifolds as well. the main
problem is that these metrics are typically non-cylindrical hence the standard
mathematical approach is not applicable easily.

in this work we will study the behaviour of the yangmills functional over
open four-manifolds equipped with a smooth complete metric belonging to a
class which contains the class of cylindrical metrics but physically relevant
strongly non-cylindrical metrics as well. we will prove that if a riemannian
manifold (m, g) of this type possesses non trivial nite energy (anti-)self-dual
g-connections for a lie group g (specied below) than the values of their en-
ergy or action or l2-norm form a discrete set in r. the proof is based on the
atiyahpatodisinger index theorem. this result generalizes corollary 4.1.3. of
[9] which states that for closely cylindrical manifolds the l2-norms of (anti-)self-
dual connections form a discrete set, because we do not require the existence of
a limit connection in innity.

to see an application, we consider the euclidean schwarzschild manifold
and prove that it possesses non-trivial nite-energy self-dual su (2)-connections
(instantons). our theorem is valid in this setup, moreover we prove that these
moduli spaces are labeled by positive integers.

we present such an instanton as well which is nothing but a projection of

the levicivita connection.

2 the theorem

let (m, g) be a connected, complete riemannian four-manifold with an end
dieomorphic to n  r+ where n is a compact, oriented three-manifold and
r+ = [0, ). note that there is a spinc structure on m hence (m, g) is auto-
matically a riemannian spinc-manifold. let g be a simple, connected, simply
connected and compact lie group. making use a principal g-bundle p over m
and a complex representation of g, we can form an associated complex vector
bundle e over m with a g-connection a on it. since m is open, such vector
bundles are classied by the group h 2(m, 1(g)). the simply-connectedness of
g implies e is always trivial over m .

consider the usual yangmills functional k  k2 : ae  r, where ae denotes

the ane space of g-connections over the trivial bundle e; their l2-norm is

kfak2

l2(m) =

1

82zm

|fa|2

g = 

1

82zm

tr(fa  fa).

(1)

here fa denotes the curvature 2-form of the connection a while  is the hodge-
operation given by the metric g. we will often use the notation for the pointwise
norm

||2

g := tr(  )

for a lie algebra valued k-form over a riemannian manifold of dimension m.
(1) is called the l2-norm or energy, or action of the connection a. since m is
not compact the norm can be undened evaluated on certain connections.

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

3

the eulerlagrange equation of (1) together with the bianchi-identity of

the curvature gives rise the yangmills equations:

dafa = 0,

da  fa = 0.

(2)

we remind the reader that a connection a on e is called an (anti)instanton
eld if it satises the (anti)self-duality equations

fa =   fa with kfak2

l2(m) < 

(3)

from now on we will focus without loss of generality on instanton solutions only
and assume that the moduli space of instantons over the riemannian manifold
(m, g) is non-empty.

in the case of instantons (1) can be written as

kfak2

l2(m) = 

1

82zm

tr(fa  fa).

(4)

if m was compact then, by the chernweil theory, the four-form tr(fa  fa)
would represent the characteristic class 1
2 c1(e)  c1(e)  c2(e) (here ci(e) are
the chern classes) of the vector bundle e so it is easy to see that it is an integer
for groups g = su (n) (moreover it is positive since it is equal to a norm).

however, if m is open it is not straightforward that (4) is integer since the

characteristic class-interpretation breaks down in this case.

our goal is to show that for a relevant class of smooth complete metrics on
m although this property of the yangmills functional does not remain valid
but if its value on a self-dual connection is nite than it belongs to a discrete
set in r.

first, we dene the class of admissible metrics over m . since the end of m
is dieomorphic to the tube n  r+ we may form the compact manifold with
boundary

mt := m \ n  (t, )

where t parameterizes the real half-line. in this way we get a non-complete but
compact manifold (mt, g|mt ) =: (mt, gmt ) with boundary mt  n  {t}. we
can restrict naturally the original vector bundle e to mt which will be denoted
by et.

remember that the riemannian manifold (m, h) is a spinc-manifold hence
we may form the complex spin bundles s over it (since the group spin(4) is
simply connected, the spin bundles are also trivial over m ). we can form the
(chiral) dirac-operator acting between the smooth sections of s (the so-called
spinors):

/ : (s+)  (s).

if we restrict / to mt we may introduce the three-dimensional self-adjoint dirac-
operator /|mt acting on the bundles s+|mt  s|mt .

now we wish to impose our assumption on h. let us denote by ch the
conformal equivalence class of the smooth complete metric h on m . suppose

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

4

there is a representing element g  ch such that its restricted dirac-operator
/|mt is independent of t  r+ for large ts i.e. using the lie derivative l along
/t there is a t  r+ with the property

l 

t

(/|mt) = 0 if

t  (t, ).

(i)

denition. let (m, h) be a riemannian four-manifold as above. the metric
h is called admissible if it is smooth, complete and there is a representing
element g  ch obeying assumption (i).

the assumption is quite restrictive but note that the important class of cylin-
drical metrics of the form dt2 +gn satises (i); moreover we will see that metrics
which are signicantly non-cylindrical can be considered in our approach as well.
fix a metric g  ch on m for an admissible metric h. using the yangmills

connection a, consider the twisted dirac-operator

/a(t) : (s+

t  et)  (s

t  et).

it is a rst order, elliptic dierential operator over the compact manifold with
boundary (mt, gmt ). now we x the atiyahpatodisinger boundary condition
(aps) on the spinors. remember that a spinor   (s+
t  et) satises the
aps if

|mt  v,

where v denotes the complex vector space spanned by the eigenspinors of
positive (negative) eigenvalues of /a(t)|mt . (note that the restricted dirac-
operator is self-adjoint!). hence we have two possible boundary conditions.

restricting our attention to spinors with one chosen boundary condition
we may apply the atiyahpatodisinger index formula for the twisted dirac-
operator [1][2][3] :

index /a(t) =

tr (fa  fa) 

(5)

where r denotes the curvature 2-form while t is the second fundamental form
of the metric on mt. moreover

h/a(t) := dim ker (/a(t)|mt ) .

finally, the famous eta-invariant of the operator is dened as follows. let

t(s) := x(t)6=0

sign((t))

|(t)|s

(s  c with re s >> 0),

tr(t  r|mt) .

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

where (t) denotes a non-zero eigenvalue of /a(t)|mt and sign((t)) is its sign.
the t function can be analytically continued to the whole complex plane and
this continuation has no pole at s = 0. dene /a(t) := t(0).

to simplify notations we will write /at instead of /a(t)|mt where at is the
restriction of a(t) to e|mt . assume a is an instanton eld over m . using (3)
(4) and (5) the yangmills functional is given by

kfak2

l2(m) = lim
t

(pa(t) + qa(t)  fg(t)) < 

(6)

pa(t) := index /a(t),

our next step is to prove that for a suitable sequence {tk|k  n} with tk  
(k  ) the limit of the function qa exists. fix a constant r  r+ such
that r > t and consider for an arbitrary t > r the canonical dieomorphisms
r : mr  mt which induce canonical isomorphisms

r : ((s  e)|mr )  ((s  e)|mt ).

furthermore, an operator /at can be pulled back to an operator 
r /at acting
over mr. however, by assumption (i), the representing metric g  ch can be
chosen in such a way that its restricted dirac-operators /at depend on t only
through the restricted yangmills connection at hence we can write


r /at = /

r at .

let t  ((s+  e)|mt ) be an eigenspinor of /at:

hence there is an r  ((s+  e)|mr ) satisfying

/att = (t)t.

in other words

/at(rr) = (t)rr.

r (

r /atr) = r(t)r.

hence, leaving r and taking into account (7) we may write

/

r at r = (t)r.

is called the character variety and will be denoted by (n ). note that (n ) is
a compact variety in bn , the gauge-equivalence classes of connections over the
trivial bundle e|n [9]. we emphasize that (n ) is independent of any metric
on n .

lemma 1. let a be a self-dual, nite-energy g-connection on e over the
riemannian manifold (m, g) where g is an arbitrary smooth, complete metric
on m . let [
r at] denote the gauge-equivalence class of the restricted connection
onto mr  n  {r}.

then there is a sequence {tk|k  n} and a class of a at connection [] 
(mr) such that for a suitable representant   [] and gauge transformations
gk the sequence {gk(
the following
holds:

r atk )|k  n} converges weakly to  i.e.

lim
k

kgk(

r atk )  kl2(mr ) = 0.

(10)

proof. let a be a self-dual connection on (mt, gmt). the determinant of
the metric gt is denoted by det gmt while that of the restricted metric gmt
is det gmt. then it is not dicult to establish the following relation between
the norms of the original four dimensional connection a and the restricted con-
nection at:

|fa|2

gmt

= 2s det gmt

det gmt

dt  |fat |2

gmt

.

consider the conformal rescaling g 7eg =: 2g ( > 0). taking into account the

conformal invariance of the left-hand side of the previous expression as well as
the self-duality equations and the transformation property of the determinant-
formula we can write

|fa|2

gmt

= 2s det gmt

det gmt

dt  |fat |2

gmt

= 2s det gmt

det gmt

|fat |2

.

selecting a suitable  we can always write:

(x, t)s det gmt (x, t)

det gmt (x)

lim inf

> 0 (x  n ).

(11)

referring to this observation we are allowed to write:

82kfak2

l2(n [t1,t+1]) =

t+1zt1 zmt

|fa|2

t+1zt1 zmt

moreover, by (11)

c(t) :=

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

hence, using kfak2
that the following inequality holds for the metric g:

l2(m) <  we can see that for each  > 0 there is a t such

kfatk2

^l2(mt)

<

2
c(t)

kfak2

l2(n [t1,t+1]) < .

in other words there is a sequence {tn|n  n } such that

lim

^l2(mtn )

= 0.

(12)

dene the function  : n  [r, )  r+ by

|f

r (egmt )(x) =:

1

|f

using this function we have:

where we have introduced the new re-scaled metriceeg := ()2g and the corre-

sponding pointwise norm. in light of (12) and the last equation we deduce the
following limit:

lim
n

kf

r atn k2

^^l2(mr)

= 0.

by uhlenbecks weak compactness theorem [13] and the compactness of the
character variety there is a subsequence {tk|k  n}  {tn|n  n} and gauge
transformations {gk|k  n} such that there is a at connection  in a unique
connected component of hom(1(mr), g) satisfying

lim
k

kgk(

r atk )  k ^^l2(mr )

= 0.

now we can exploit the freedom hidden in the choice of the function ; in
accordance with the previous requirement (11) we can achieve that the following
also holds:

hence for suitable large ts we have

lim inf
t

(x, t)(t)  1.

|gk(

r atk )  |2

= |gk(

r atk )  |2

gmr

 |gk(

.

but this proves (10). 

eegmr

using this at connection , and the already used representant g  ch for the
admissible metric h in equation (7), consider the twisted dirac-operator

d : ((s+  e)|mr )  ((s  e)|mr ).

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

suppressing the gauge transformations gk, it is straightforward by (8), (9) and
(10) that

qa(tk) = lim

2(cid:16)/

r atk(cid:17) =

(d + hd ) .

(13)

our next step is to extend the twisted dirac-operator d from the boundary to
the whole (mr, gmr ). note that in general the homomorphism i : 1(mr) 
1(mr) induced by the embedding i : mr  mr is not injective; hence we
cannot extend a general at connection given on the boundary to mr as a at
connection. indeed, let  : s1  n be a loop representing a class []  ker i.
if a at connection  has a non-trivial holonomy around  then it cannot be
extended to mr in a at way.

hence let b be a connection on the bundle er satisfying b|mr = . using
this extended at connection, we may form the twisted dirac operator /b(r)
on (mr, gmr ) satisfying /b(r)|mr = d.

the time has come to apply index formula (5) again for the new twisted

dirac-operator /b(r). this implies:

1
2

(d + hd ) =

1

2(cid:0)/b (r) + h/b (r)(cid:1) = fg(r)  index /b(r) 

(14)
note that by (13) we have given another representation of the limit of the
function qa belonging to the sequence {tk|k  n}. since r was arbitrary we
can specialize it to be tk, one value of the sequence {tk|k  n}.
now we can summarize our results. making use (6) we get:

tr(cid:18)  d +

in the rst equality we have used (13) while in the second one (14) for r = tk.
using the chernsimons theorem [5] we can write for each tk

1

82 zmtk

tr (fb  fb) < .
    (cid:19) mod 1.

3

so we can derive from the last two expressions the result that (we also use the
atness of  to re-write the chernsimons function):

theorem. let (m, h) be an open, connected riemannian four-manifold with
an end dieomorphic to n  r+ where n is a compact, oriented three-manifold.
assume that h is a smooth, complete, admissible metric on n while g is a
simple, connected, simply connected and compact lie group. let a be a self-
dual nite-action g-connection on the complex g-vector bundle e.

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

9

then for a at g-connection  on e|n , belonging to a unique connected

component of (n ) depending only on a the following holds:

kfak2

l2(m) 

1

242zn

tr (    ) mod 1.

(15)

proof. since both kfak2
l2(m) and at connections are independent of the rep-
resenting element g  ch, (15) is valid for each metric in the class ch, especially
for h itself. 

it is important to emphasize that we have not proved that the twisted dirac-
operator /a is an elliptic operator over the whole non-compact m ; we just
proved that the dierence of index functions associated to the original self-
dual connection a has a limit belonging to a certain sequence {tk|k  n}.

hence, by (15) we have presented a generalized chernsimons theorem
in the sense that we have not required the existence of a limit connection in
innity.

in light of our theorem, it would be useful to say something on chern
simons invariants of three-manifolds. in general, it is quite dicult to calculate
these numbers [4][8].

rather we turn our attention to a physically relevant application.

3 an application: the euclidean schwarzschild

manifold

in this section we consider a physically relevant application of the above the-
orem: we will prove that the moduli space of smooth, self-dual, nite action
su (2)-connections over the euclidean schwarzschild manifold is non-empty.
moreover it will turn out this metric is admissible, hence we will be able to
use our theorem.

let m > 0 be a xed real number and consider the following metric g locally

given by

ds2 =(cid:18)1 

2m

r (cid:19) d 2 +(cid:18)1 

2m

r (cid:19)1

dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2),

where

r  (2m, );   [0, 8m);   [0, ];   [0, 2).

(16)

this is the traditional spherically symmetric vacuum-solution to einsteins equa-
tions. it is known [14] that in the case of the above parameterization g can be
realized as a smooth, complete metric on m := s2  r2 hence (s2  r2, g)
is a complete riemannian manifold with end s2  s1  r+. (for the sake of
order we remark that, according to standard notation, in this case the length of
the end-tube is parameterized by r instead of the letter t used in the previous
section.)

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

10

to see this, consider the new coordinates

using these new variables we get

r := 4mr1 
2m (cid:19)4
ds2 = r2d2 +(cid:18) r(r)

2m
r

,  :=


4m

.

dr2 + r2(r)(d2 + sin2 d2)

(17)

where the function r(r) is dened by the above substitution. in (17) r plays
the role of the radial coordinate while  corresponds to the angle variable on
b2
analitycally and the resulting metric is complete (b2
r2 of (ordinary) radius 4m).

4m. from this we see that the metric extends to the whole m = s2  b2

4m
4m denotes the open disc in

now we wish to extend (17) to a slightly larger manifold. however, this goal
is threatened by the fact that the metric (17) is singular on the boundary of the
ball b2. hence we proceed as follows: choose a point x  m and two sequences
of open sets {un|n  n} {vn|n  n} obeying x  uk  vk, uk  uk+1,
vk  vk+1 for all k and u = m .

lemma 2. there exists a dierentiable manifold n homeomorphic to the four-
sphere s4 and a smooth generic metric hn on it such that hn|un = g|un .

+ whose part s1  b3

4m+ and choose another one z  :=
proof. consider the manifold m  := s2  b2
s1  b3
 is denoted by z  z . now form the manifold
n gluing together z  and m  along their collars given by m  \ m and z  \ z
of width  using the identity function on s2  s1. note that both m  and
z  have the same type of boundary: s2  s1. take a smooth cut-o function
n : n  r+ satisfying

n|un = 1,

n|n \vn = 0.

fix a generic smooth metric h on n and take

hn := ng + (1  n)h.

obviously, (n, hn) becomes a riemannian manifold homeomorphic to s4 en-
dowed with a smooth generic metric possessing the required properties. 

before turning our attention to the existence result we remind the reader the
notion of a concentrated su (2) (anti)self-dual connection over a compact, ori-
ented, riemannian four-manifold (x, g) [6].

consider the following triple:

(, [a], (x1, ..., xk)),

where  is a positive number less then the diameter of (x, g), [a] is the equiva-
lence class of the (anti)self-dual connection a on an su (2) bundle e of chern

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

11

class k over (x, g) (i.e. a point of mk, the moduli space of su (2) (anti)self-dual
connections of chern class k) and (x1, ..., xk) is an unordered set of k points of
x. this triple is called a concentrated instanton if the following hold:

 xis are dierent and d(xi, xj ) > 3;

 there is a trivialization  : e|w  c2  w , where w := x \ ib(xi)

such that

 for all i

l2(w ) =

l2(b(xi)) =

|fa|2 = 1  i,

for given numbers , i ( = 1 + ... + k).

here d denotes the geodesic distance and b(xi) is a geodesic ball of radius

 around xi.

one of the basic results of the theory of instantons over compact four-
manifolds is taubess grafting procedure [12] (see also [6][7]):
let (x, g) be a
connected, oriented, compact four-manifold possessing a positive denite in-
tersection form and a generic metric. then m1 is not empty; if m
1 denotes
the part of the moduli space containing concentrated instantons (, [a], x) with
 < , then there is a dieomorphism

for a suitable small .

 : m

1  x  (0, )

proposition. there exist smooth non-trivial su (2) instantons with nite ac-
tion over the euclidean schwarzschild manifold (m, g).

proof. fix the point x  n used in the construction of the open sets uk, vk and
a metric hn on the constructed manifold n of lemma 2. clearly n is simply
connected and its intersection form is trivial hence positive denite. this implies
that we can apply the previous result and see that there is a dieomorphism

m

1  s4  (0, )

for a suitable  > 0. consider a  <  and a geodesic ball b(x)  un 
m . due to the above dieomorphism there exists a concentrated instanton
(, [an], x) obeying

1

82 zb(x)

|fan |2 = 1  

for a suitable  and n satisfying b(x)  un if n > n0.

in this way for the sequence of metrics {hn | n  n} we have constructed a
sequence of instantons {an | n  n} with non trivial curvature in the essential

g. etesi: on the yangmills functional

12

m part of n . taking this into account and taking the limit n   we produce
an instanton (, [a], x)|m =: (, [a], x) concentrated around x. note that by
construction this limit exists. its action also by construction satises

82 zm

|fa|2  zb(x)

|fa|2 = 82(1  ) > 0. 

now we wish to prove that the euclidean schwarzschild metric is admissible i.e.
satises assumption (i) above. consider the connection matrix a = (ai
j); in the
standard orthonormal basis it takes the form:

0

p1  2m/r d p1  2m/r sin  d

(18)
the restricted connection matrix ar is given by omitting the second row and
second column in (18). from this we can see that the associated dirac-operator
is not independent of r. consider the rescaled metric g/r2; it is not dicult to

this shows that the restriction of the untwisted, four-dimensional, chiral dirac-
operator / to the boundary mr is independent of r for a metric in cg hence
assumption (i) is satised. this demonstrates that the euclidean schwarzschild-
metric is admissible although it is far from being a cylindrical metric of the form
dr2 + gs 2s 1 near the end of s2  r2! hence, using our theorem we see that
every smooth, (anti-)self-dual, nite-action su (2)-connection has an l2-norm
congruent to a chernsimons invariant of s2  s1.

however, since 1(s2  s1) = z, (s2  s1) is connected for a connected lie
group g. but the chernsimons function is constant on a connected component
of (n ) hence in our case s2  s1 has only one chernsimons invariant equal
to zero proving that instantons over the euclidean schwarzschild manifold have
integer action.

4 an explicit solution

to round things o, we construct the simplest instanton explicitly based on
standard results.

if (x, g) is a four dimensional riemannian spin manifold which is moreover
einstein it is well known that the projection of the lifted (i.e. so(4)-valued)
levicivita connection onto the su(2)+ part according to the lie algebra de-
composition so(4) = su(2)+  su(2) is self-dual.

and the projected connection a+ takes the form (a denotes the original so(4)-
valued connection pulled back to m ):

since the euclidean schwarzschild manifold (m, g) meets the above conditions
we can construct an su (2) instanton from its levicivita connection.

putting (18) into (19) we get for the instanton eld:

a+(, r, , ) =

(20)
where we have used the identication su(2)  imh given by (1, 2, 3) 7
(i, j, k).

let us calculate the action of this solution! the curvature or eld strength

f+ = da+ + a+  a+ of the instanton reads as follows:

f+(, r, , ) =

1

r2

2  mp1  2m/r sin

d  d! j

mp1  2m/r

r

d  d(cid:19) k.

dr  d! i+

from this we easily derive, using parameterization (16) for (m, g) and the
fact that the scalar product tr(ab) is given by 2re(xy) in the canonical
identication su(2)  imh, the result

s(a+) = 

1

82zm

tr(f+  f+) = 1.

5 concluding remarks

in this paper we have studied the yangmills functional on open riemannian
four-manifolds (m, g) with non-cylindrical end.
it is straightforward to ask
whether it is possible to remove the admissibility condition on the metric in
order to prove the same result for general complete metrics.

an interesting application of our result was the study of the euclidean
schwarzschild manifold. although this metric is unrelevant from the mathe-
matical point of view, it is well-known that this manifold have important phys-
ical applications e.g.
it makes possible to understand the hawking-radiation
in a very natural way. but this metric is relevant also if we study the semi-
classical structure of an su (2) yangmills theory over the original lorentzian
schwarzschild space-time. we see the semi-classical structure is identical to
the at r4 case i.e. there are smooth instantons in the wick-rotated theory
and their l2-norm is an integer. this indicates that the same is true for more
general space-times describing gravity and yangmills elds.

we would like just mention that the vacuum structure of the original lorentzian

schwarzschild space-time is signicantly dierent comparing to the at r4 case,
however. these two observations raise the question how to interpret instantons
from a general eld-theoretic point of view.
