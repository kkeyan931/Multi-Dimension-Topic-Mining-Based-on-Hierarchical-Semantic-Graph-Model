abstract

we present a class of spacetime rotations that preserve a proportion of space-

time supersymmetry. we then give the rules for superposing these rotations with

various branes to construct rotating brane solutions which preserve exotic frac-

tions of supersymmetry. we also investigate the superposition of rotations with

intersecting branes at angles and we nd new rotating intersecting branes at an-

gles congurations. we demonstrate this with two examples of such solutions one

involving intersecting ns-5-branes on a string at sp(2) angles superposed with fun-

damental strings and pp-waves, and the other involving intersecting m-5-branes on

a string at sp(2) angles superposed with membranes and pp-waves. we nd that

the geometry of some of these solutions near the intersection region of every pair
of 5-branes is ads3  s3  s3  e and ads3  s3  s3  e2, respectively. we
also present a class of solutions that can be used for null string and m-theory

compactications preserving supersymmetry.

1. introduction

many of the insights in the non-perturbative structure of the superstrings and

in the understanding of m-theory have been found by investigated the soliton-like

solutions of the ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity theories [1, 2]. most of

the attention so far has been focused on supersymmetric solutions, i.e. those that

they preserve a proportion of the supersymmetry of the underlying theory. it is

remarkable that a large class of supersymmetric solutions of the supergravity theo-

ries can be constructed by superposing elementary soliton solutions which preserve

1/2 of the spacetime supersymmetry [3, 4, 5]. these elementary solutions are the

various brane solutions of supergravity theories, the pp-wave and kk-monopole.

after such a superposition, the resulting solutions have the interpretation of inter-

secting branes or branes ending on other branes, and whenever appropriate, in the

background of a pp-wave or a kk-monopole [6]. recently it has been realized that

angular momentum can be superposed to brane or to intersecting brane congu-

rations in such way that a proportion of spacetime supersymmetry is preserved [7,

8, 9, 10]. the resulting congurations have the interpretation of rotating branes

or rotating intersecting branes. such backgrounds have also been consider in the

context of sigma models as exact solutions of string theory [11].

in this paper, we shall present a systematic investigation of the type of rota-

tions that can be added to branes and intersecting branes to preserve a fraction of

spacetime supersymmetry. we shall nd that in many cases supersymmetric ro-

tations are associated with solutions of maxwell eld and killing spinor equations

on a possibly curved background. in turn, supersymmetric solutions of maxwell

eld equations can be found by integrating certain bps-like conditions in various

dimensions which are associated to certain subalgebras of so(8). a list of such

subalgebras includes spin(7), g2, sp(2) and su(n) for n = 2, 3, 4. we shall give the

explicit solutions of the maxwell equations associated with all these subalgebras.

then we shall consider the associated spacetime solution. we shall nd that such

spacetimes are asymptotically at with zero mass and momentum but they have

2

non-vanishing angular momentum. some of these spacetimes could be thought as

elementary, for example those associated with the subalgebras spin(7) and su(n)

for n = 2, 3, 4, and so they can be superposed with branes to give new solutions

with the interpretation of rotating branes. however unlike the elementary branes,

pp-waves and kk-monopoles, spacetimes with only elementary rotation may pre-

serve less than 1/2 of spacetime supersymmetry



. some other rotations can be

constructed by a non-parallel superposition of elementary ones. such rotating

spacetimes are associated with sp(2) and g2 subgroups. we shall nd that these

composite rotations can be superposed to intersecting branes at angles. thus we

construct solutions with the interpretation of rotating rotated intersecting branes.

in what follows, we shall refer to intersections or superpositions of branes at g-

angles as g-intersections or g-superpositions, respectively. we shall present two

main examples of such rotating rotated intersecting branes. these examples in-

volve the sp(2)-intersecting ns-5-branes and the sp(2)-intersecting m-5-branes

on a string of [12, 13], respectively. in addition, pp-waves will be added to both

congurations as well as strings in the former and membranes in the latter. ro-

tations will also be investigated in the background of sp(2)-superpositions of kk-

monopoles which is described by a toric eight-dimensional hyper-kahler metric.

the rotation in this case is related to the two tri-holomorphic vector elds of this

geometry. rotations will be examined in the background of ricci-at cones with

special holonomy and their various superpositions with strings, membranes and

pp-waves will be also considered. in particular, this will add rotation to the solu-

tions found in [14, 15]. the proportion of spacetime supersymmetry preserved by

all the above congurations will also be given. we shall nd that in many cases

the solutions preserve various exotic fractions of supersymmetry.

the geometries near the intersection region (near horizon) of the above rotating

sp(2)-intersecting 5-brane congurations will be investigated. we shall nd that

the geometry near the intersection region of every pair of ns-5-branes involved in

 this indicates that there may be another interpretation for this rotations probably in terms

of more elementary objects. however we shall not pursue this further here.

3

a sp(2)-intersection on a string is e(1,3)  s3  s3. this geometry is the same
as that for the associated orthogonal intersection [16, 17]. then we shall nd

that the geometry at the intersection region of rotating sp(2)-intersecting ns-5-
branes superposed with pp-waves and strings is ads3  s3  s3  e. in addition,
the geometry at the intersection region of rotating sp(2)-intersecting m-5-branes
superposed with pp-waves and membranes is ads3 s3 s3 e2. for this in both
cases, we shall present approximate solutions which has the desirable behaviour

near the intersection regions. we remark that these near horizon geometries are

the same as those found in [16,17, 10] for the associated orthogonal intersections.
finally we shall show that spaces with topology rn  l solve the eld equations
of d=11 and d=10 supergravities, where l is a principal u(1) bundle over either
tori, or calabi-yau or other manifolds with special holonomy. we shall argue that

such spaces can be used to compactify strings and m-theory along directions for

which one is null. this adapts the null compactications investigated for example

in [18] to strings and m-theory.

this paper has been organized as follows: in section two, we present the ansatz

for our solutions in the context of type ii strings. in section three, we investigate

spacetimes with pure rotation and explain the relation between rotations and sub-

algebras of so(8). we then present new solutions with the interpretation of rotating

strings and rotating ns-5-branes. superpositions of pp-waves are also considered.

in section four, we investigate rotations in the background of toric hyper-kahler

manifolds. in section ve, we construct new solutions with the interpretation of

rotating rotated ns-5-branes and then superpose them with strings and waves. in

section six, we investigate rotations in the background of ricci-at cones with spe-

cial holonomy and then superpose them with strings and membranes. in section

seven, we give an m-theory interpretation to our solutions by lifting them to eleven

dimensions. in section eight, we nd the geometry of the rotating rotated 5-brane

solutions near the intersection of every pair of 5-branes involved in the congura-

tion. in section nine, we nd the compact solutions of strings and m-theory that

can be used for null compactications. in section ten, we give our conclusions and

4

in appendix a we investigate the type ii t-duality and iib s-duality properties

of our solutions.

2. common sector rotations

the common sector elds or the nsns elds of type ii and heterotic string
theories include the spacetime metric g, a three-form eld strength h and the

dilaton . the eld equations of the associated eective supergravity theories can

be consistently truncated to this sector and they are as follows:

rm n  hm p qhn

p q + 2m n  = 0

p (e2h p m n(cid:1) = 0

,

(2.1)

where we have set all fermions to zero and rm n is the ricci tensor of the metric

gm n ; m, n, p, q = 0, . . . , 9. there is another eld equation that of the dilaton

but it is implied by the above two equations (up to a constant).

the killing spinor equations for type ii theories that involve only the above

elds are

()
m  = 0
hm n p m n p(cid:1) = 0 ,

1
3!

(cid:0)m m  

(2.2)

where  are 16-component killing spinors and the connections of the covariant
derivatives () are

n p  h m

n p ;

(2.3)

m

n p is the levi-civita connection. in iia and iib supergravities, + and  have

either the opposite or the same chirality, respectively. for the heterotic string, we

simply truncate the above four killing spinor equations to two which are those of

either + or .

5

we shall seek solutions that describe the superposition of rotations with con-

gurations of the common sector. these congurations include the fundamental

string, the ns-5-brane, the pp-wave and the ten-dimensional kk-monopole as well

as their intersections or superpositions. to describe the ansatz of such congu-
ration, we begin with a static solution on m(10) = e(1,1)  m(8) of the nsns
sector of the form

where

ds2 = ds2(e(1,1)) + ds2
(8)

h = h(8)
e2 = e2(8) ,

ds2

(8) = abdxadxb

h(8) =

1
3!

habcdxa  dxb  dxc

(2.4)

(2.5)

and e2(8) depend only on the coordinates {xa; i = 1, . . . , 8} of the eight-dimensional
manifold m(8). such solution describes congurations that involve the ns-5-brane,
the kk-monopole and their various intersections and superpositions. it remains

to add a fundamental string, a pp-wave and a rotation into this background. for
this we introduce a one-form a, and two functions g1 and g2 on m(8) which will
be associated with the rotation, the fundamental string and pp-wave, respectively.

then we write the ansatz

1 dv(du + a + g2dv) + ds2

(8)

ds2 = 2g1
h = dv  d(g1
e2 = g1
1 e2(8) ,

1 a) + du  dv  dg1

1 + h(8)

(2.6)

where  is a real number and u, v are light-cone coordinates. the functions g1, g2,

the one-form a and the constant  will be determined by solving the killing
spinor and eld equations of supergravity. the metric ds2 and the three-form

6

eld strength h are invariant under the gauge transformations

a  a + d
u  u +  ,

(2.7)

where  = (x) is the parameter of the gauge transformations. our proposed
solutions are therefore associated with a principal u(1) bundle l over m(8) with
bre coordinate u. the presence of the functions g1 and g2 in (2.6) to describe a

fundamental string and a pp-wave is standard and we shall not explain it further.

the addition of the gauge potential a to describe rotation is motivated from the

way that angular momentum is computed at innity. moreover a is taken to

be independent from the worldvolume coordinates of the associated brane since

angular momentum in the context of branes in measured at the transverse spatial

innity; this is a direct analogue to the case of black holes where angular momentum

is measured at the spatial innity. the expression of the angular momentum of a

p-brane is given in the section below.

to nd solutions to killing spinor equations, it is convenient to introduce the

frame

ev = dv

eu = g1

1 (du + a + g2dv)

ea = ea ,

(2.8)

where e is a frame of ds2

(8). the metric and 3-form eld strength in terms of this

frame are written as

ds2 = 2eveu + abeaeb
h = ev  deu + h(8) .

(2.11)

we have also taken the killing spinors  to be independent from the light-cone

coordinates u, v.

to determine g1, g2 and a, we have also to use the eld equations (2.1). these
are dramatically simplied provided that we choose  =  1
2 . as we shall see later
for these values of  and for certain choices of m(8), our solutions will preserve
a proportion of spacetime supersymmetry. substituting our ansatz into the eld

where indices are raised and lowered using the metric ds2
determinant of ds2

(8) on m(8) and  is the

the two terms in the last eld equation above changes. the two choices for  are
symmetric, so without loss of generality, we shall set  =  1
2 for the rest of the
paper. in what follows we shall explore the solutions of the killing spinor and eld
equations for various choices of m(8) and investigate their applications in strings
and m-theory.

2.1. asymptotics and angular momentum

ten-dimensional spacetimes with the interpretation of p-branes are asymptot-
ically e(1,9) = e(1,p)  e9p at the transverse spatial innity, where e(1,p) are the
worldvolume directions and e9p are the transverse directions of the brane. the

mass per unit volume (or tension) m and the charge q per unit volume of a p-
brane are given as integrals over the s8p  e9p sphere at the transverse spatial
innity. writing the metric as

gm n = m n + hm n ,

(2.14)

where  is the metric of ten-dimensional minkowski spacetime, the angular mo-

mentum of a p-brane per unit volume is given by

jab = kp limr z

s8p (cid:2)  xach0b + xathcb + h0bac  (a, b)(cid:3)ncr8pd (2.15)

where {xa; a = 1, . . . , 9  p} are the transverse coordinates of the brane, r =
pabxaxb, na = xa/r is the outward normal vector of the s8p sphere at innity,
kp is a constant and d is the volume form of s8p.

our ansatz (2.6) is invariant under the action of the killing vector eld x = t.

since we are considering backgrounds that involve either a fundamental string or

a ns-5-brane with possibly a wave and a rotation, p = 1 or p = 5, respectively.

9

in the case of fundamental string, we take m(8) = e8 and require that at the
transverse spatial innity

g1 = 1 + o(

g2 = 0 + o(

a = 0 + o(

1
r6 )
1
r6 )
1
r7 )

and similarly for the 5-brane. in particular for the 5-brane

a = 0 + o(

1
r3 )

the angular momentum in both cases can be written as

jab = kp limr z

s8p (cid:2)  xacab + abac  (a, b)(cid:3)ncr8pd

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(7p)v (s8p) , where v (s8p) is the volume of
a convenient choice for kp is kp = 
a (8-p)-dimensional sphere of radius one. for solutions that describe intersecting

1

branes with rotation, the behaviour at innity is rather complicated. however we

can compute the rotation of each brane involved in the intersection by taking the

rest of the branes at innity. in this case the expression for the angular momentum

is again given by (2.18).

3. pure rotation

the geometric conditions imposed by the requirement of supersymmetry and

the eld equations on the connection a can be most conveniently illustrated by
taking m(8) = e8, g1 = 1 and g2 = 0. in this case, our ansatz (2.6) reduces to

ds2 = 2dv(du + a) + ds2(e8)
h = 

dv  da ;

1
2

(3.1)

( =  1

2 ). the angular momentum of the associated spacetime is induced by a.

10

a direct substitution into killing spinor equations (2.10) reveals that there are

solutions provided that

v+ = 0
fabab = 0 ,

(3.2)

and  constant; we have made no distinction between coordinate and frame indices
on e8. moreover the eld equations reduce to

afab = 0 .

(3.3)

therefore f satises the killing spinor and eld equations of maxwell theory on
e8.

the rst killing spinor equation can be easily solved giving eight killing

spinors. to nd the solutions of the second killing spinor equation, we rst observe
that the space of two forms on en can be identied with the lie algebra of so(n),

i.e.

2

^(en) = so(n) .

(3.4)

then we view the maxwell killing spinor equation as the equation for a spinor

singlet under an innitesimal orthogonal rotation with parameter f . for generic
orthogonal rotations in e8, there are no such singlets and so the solution does not

admit any additional killing spinors. so supergravity solutions associated with

a generic solution of the maxwell eld equations of a preserve 1/4 of spacetime

supersymmetry. however more supersymmetry can be preserved by such super-

gravity solutions, if f takes values in an appropriate subalgebra h of so(8). such

subalgebras are those that are associated with innitesimal orthogonal rotations

which leave certain spinors invariant (see also [19, 20]). examples of such sub-

algebras of so(8) are h = su(2), su(3), su(4), sp(2), g2 and spin(7).

in the table

below we have summarized the various fractions of supersymmetry preserved by

the solution for every subalgebra of so(8).

for the computation of these fractions, we have rst decomposed the sixteen-
dimensional representations 16s and 16c of cli(e(1,9)) under spin(1, 1) spin(8)
as

16s  (1s, 8s)  (1c, 8c)
16c  (1s, 8c)  (1c, 8s) .

(3.5)

the solutions of the rst killing spinor equation in (3.2) are either in the subspace
(1s, 8s) or in the subspace (1s, 8c) of 16s depending on whether v+ = 0 is
related to a anti-chiral or to a chiral projection of cli(1, 1), respectively. without

loss of generality we can choose the former case, so the killing spinors are in

(1s, 8s) subspace of 16s. the remaining killing spinors arise as singlets in the

decomposition of 8s and 8c that appears in the second equation of (3.5) under the

associated subalgebra h of so(8) in the table above. similar computations have

been done elsewhere (see for example [12]) and we shall not give more details here.

3.1. h = su(2), su(3) and su(4)

we begin the construction of explicit supergravity solutions by rst taking f

to take values in h = su(n) for n = 2, 3, 4. such connections have support in a
subspace e2n of e8 and they are characterized by a complex structure k on e2n
which determines the embedding of su(n) in so(2n)  so(8). for h = su(2), a
is either self-dual or anti-self-dual connection depending on the choice of complex
structure k relative to the choice of orientation of e4. for h = su(n), n = 3, 4, a is
a hermitian-einstein connection on e6 and e8, respectively [22]. to continue, we
choose complex coordinates {z;  = 1, . . . , n} with respect to k. the conditions

12

on f for h = su(n) are

f = 0
 f  = 0 .

(3.6)

note that the at metric is hermitian with respect to k and that the above con-

ditions on f imply the maxwell eld equations using the jacobi identity.

to nd the solutions of the above equations, we rst observe that the rst one

implies that

a = u
a  =   u ,

(3.7)

where u is a complex function. substituting this into the second equation in (3.6),

we nd that

this equation can be easily solved to nd that

  (cid:0)u  u(cid:1) = 0 .

where

u  u = if

f = 1 +

n

xi

i

|z  zi|2n2

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

is a real harmonic function on r2n. the above equations do not determine the real

part of u but this is expected since it is a gauge degree of freedom. so up to a

gauge transformation, the solution is

a = if
a  = i f ,

which can be rewritten in real coordinates as

aa = k b

abf .

(3.11)

(3.12)

in four dimensions, the solution in this form has already been given in [23, 24].

moreover it turns out that if the kahler form of k is self-dual, then a is anti-self-

13

dual and vice-versa. in fact in this case the solution can be generalized. for this we

use that h = su(2) = sp(1) and observe the hermitian-einstein condition on f can

be imposed with any of the three complex structures, or a linear combination of

them, that dene the embedding of sp(1) in so(4). we remark that independently

from the choice of complex structure, f is either a self-dual or anti-self-dual two-
form. let {ir; r = 1, 2, 3} be the quaternionic structure that denes the embedding
of sp(1) in so(4). using the linearity of the equations and the remark above, the

most general solution can be written as

aa =

n

3

xi

xr=1

(ir)b

ab

r
i

|x  xi|2 .

(3.13)

we shall see that for the investigation the asymptotic behaviour of supergravity

solutions, it is sucient to consider spherically symmetric rotations. the rest of the

solutions can be thought as parallel superpositions of the spherically symmetric

ones. for spherically symmetric solutions, we have

for n = 3 and n = 4, and

aa = k b

|x|2n2

aa =

xr=1

(ir)b

r
|x|2

(3.14)

(3.15)

for n = 2, respectively. the solutions for n = 2 and n = 4 can be used to add

rotation to a ns-5-brane and to a fundamental string, respectively. the case n = 3

can be used to add rotation to a d-3-brane or a compactied fundamental string.

the latter case will lead a rotating black hole in seven dimensions. using the

expression for the angular momentum (2.18), we nd that

jab = kab

14

(3.16)

for n = 3, 4, and

jab =

3

xr=1

r(ir)ab

(3.17)

for n = 2. in both cases, the angular momentum has one independent eigenvalue.

3.2. h = sp(2)

let {kr; r = 1, 2, 3} be a quaternionic structure in e8 that determines the
embedding of sp(2) in so(8). the condition that f is in sp(2) is equivalent to

the condition that f is a (1,1) two-form with respect all three complex structures
{kr; r = 1, 2, 3}, i.e.

fab(kr)a

c(kr)b

d = fcd

(3.18)

(no summation over r). to nd the conditions on a, it is convenient to introduce
a coordinates {xi; i = 1, 2;  = 1, . . . , 4} on e8 such that

kr

i

j = i

j(kr)



(3.19)

where {kr; r = 1, 2, 3} is a quaternionic structure is e4. then since f is (1,1)-form
with respect to all three complex structures {kr; r = 1, 2, 3}, we choose the rst
one and can write

ai = (k1)

if ,

(3.20)

where h is a real function, as in the case of hermitian-einstein connections in the

previous section. this leads to an f which is (1,1)-form with respect to k1. it is

straightforward to show that for f to be (1,1)-form with respect to the remaining

complex structures then

ij f = 0

ij f = jif

15

(3.21)

solving these equations



, we nd that

3

ai = x{(p,a)}

xr=1

(kr)

i

r(cid:0)(p, a)(cid:1)
|pixi  a|2 ,

(3.22)

where the parameters {pi, i = 1, 2; a,  = 1, . . . , 4} of the solution are the real
numbers. to write this solution, we have also used the fact that a can be written in

three dierent but equivalent ways as (3.20) with respect to each complex structure
{kr; r = 1, 2, 3}.

the interpretation of the solutions (3.22) is as a superposition of four-dimensional

abelian instantons (or anti-instantons) at sp(2) angles. this follows from the anal-

ysis in [25] of the non-abelian case. therefore the abelian gauge potentials (3.22)

can be used to rotate intersecting brane congurations. this is achieved by using

each four-dimensional abelian instanton involved in the superposition to rotate a

brane involved in the intersection. we shall verify this when we investigate the

rotation of intersecting 5-branes at angles. if we take all the abelian instantons

at innity apart from one and compute the angular momentum of the associated

spacetime, we shall nd that

(j )ab =

3

xr=1

r(kr)

(3.23)

which is that of the n = 2 case of the previous section.

we nally remark that the condition that f is in sp(2) can also be written as

self-duality like condition

3.3. h = spin(7) and g2

we shall rst give the solutions for which f is in spin(7). for this, let  be

the 3-form with components the structure constants of imaginary unit octonions
and  be its dual in e7, i.e.

ijk =

1

(3.26)

where i, j, k, , p, q, s = 1, . . . , 7. then a spin(7)-invariant self-dual 4-form  in e8

can be dened as

ijk8 = ijk

on v2(e8). these projectors are associated with an orthogonal decomposition of
v2(e8) into a 21-dimensional subspace [26], which can be identied with spin(7),

and a seven-dimensional subspace, respectively. the condition that f is in spin(7)

is therefore p2f = 0 or equivalently

ab

cdfcd = fab .

to nd solutions to this equation, we introduce the ansatz

and v is a (constant) vector in e7. the matrices {ii; i = 1, . . . , 7} satisfy iiij +
ijii = 2ij and so they give an irreducible representation of cli(r7) equipped
with the negative denite inner product. using the identities

mijkmpq = 6[i
mijmk = 2ij

k ,

[pjk]
k  ij

a direct substitution of the ansatz into the condition p2f = 0 reveals that

ababf = 0 ,

for any choice of v. so f is a harmonic function in e8. therefore for this class of

solutions

aa =

(3.35)

it is clear that the above abelian u(1) gauge elds can be used to rotate funda-

mental strings and m-2-branes. the spherically symmetric solution is

the angular momentum of the spacetime associated with this solution is

(j )ab =

(3.36)

(3.37)

next we shall examine the case where f is in g2. we again introduce the

which introduce an orthogonal decomposition of v2(r7) into a 14-dimensional

subspace, that can be identied with g2, and a seven-dimensional subspace. since

p2 projects onto the seven-dimensional subspace, the condition that f is in g2 is

p2(f ) = 0 or equivalently

1
2

ij

kfk = fij .

to solve this equation, we write the ansatz

ai = vkk

j

ijf

(3.39)

(3.40)

in analogy with the spin(7) case above. then for f to be in g2, we nd that

ij

kvkf  ijkvkmmf = 0 .

(3.41)

since the above equation is linear v, we can take with loss of generality v to have

length one. to solve the above equation let us assume that v = (0, . . . , 0, 1). now
if we take f to be independent from x7, then the above equation implies that f is
harmonic on the hyperplane in e7 orthogonal to v. so for this choice of v a typical

solution is

f = 1 +

n

xn=1

n

|x  xn|4

(3.42)

where x are the rst six coordinates of e7. for the most general solution of this

type using the linearity of the condition (3.39) in a, we can sum over dierent

19

choices of v. this leads to the following solution for a:

n

ai = x{v}

xn=1

vkk

j

ij

n

|xv  (xv)n|4

v

,

(3.43)

where xv are the coordinates of the hyperplane pv orthogonal to v and |  |v is the
norm on pv induced by the standard norm on e7.

the solutions of the condition that f is in g2 has many similarities with the

solutions we have found for the condition that f is in sp(2) in section (3.2). in

the latter case, the expression for a is given by summing over four-dimensional
subspaces of e8 while in the former the expression for a is given by summing over
hyperplanes in e7. therefore as in the sp(2) case, the abelian u(1) gauge eld

can be interpreted as a superposition of abelian hermitian-einstein instantons for
which f is in su(3) along hyper-planes in e7. this interpretation is consistent with

the power law decay of the gauge eld at innity.

the u(1) gauge elds (3.43) can be used to rotate either intersecting brane

congurations or appropriately compactied fundamental strings and m-2-branes.

the rotation of the spacetime associated with the spherically symmetric solution

3.4. h = so(8)

there are many solutions to the maxwell equations that include for exam-

ple elecromagnetic waves. here we shall seek solutions for which f spans other

subalgebras of so(8) from those that we have mentioned in the previous sections.

such congurations as solutions of the maxwell theory are not supersymmetric.

moreover, we shall require that they resemble the supersymmetric solutions that

we have constructed in the previous sections. an example of this is to consider a

slight generalization of the hermitian-einstein condition on f by letting f to take

values in u(n) instead of the su(n) subalgebra of so(2n), i.e.

fab = (k)ab .

(3.46)

the maxwell eld equations imply that  is constant. again f is a (1,1)-form with

respect to the complex structure k and a straightforward computation reveals that

a solution of (3.46) is

aa = k b

abf 

1
2

(k)abxb ,

(3.47)

where f is that of (3.10). the advantage of considering (3.46) is that it admits an

obvious generalization on hermitian manifolds which include the calabi-yau and

hyper-kahler manifolds. the disadvantage of such solution is that the second term

in (3.47) may lead to spacetimes that are not asymptotically at.

an alternative way to construct non-supersymmetric solutions is by superpos-

ing the supersymmetric solutions found in the previous sections using the linearity

of maxwell equations. to demonstrate this, we shall rst construct a solution for

which f takes values in so(4) by superposing and instanton and anti-instanton solu-
tion. for this we introduce two commuting quaternionic structures {ir; r = 1, 2, 3}
and {jr; r = 1, 2, 3} on r4 associated with the decomposition so(4) = su(2)su(2).

21

then a solution with f in so(4) is

aa =

|x  xi|2 +

n

xi=1

|x  xi|2 .

(3.48)

these abelian u(1) gauge eld can be used to rotate ns-5-branes



and compactied

strings which will lead to rotating black holes in ve-dimensions. a spherically

symmetric u(1) gauge eld is

3

aa =

xr=1(cid:2)r(ir)b

a + r(jr)b

a(cid:3)b

1
|x|2

and the angular momentum of the associated spacetime is

3

(j )ab =

xr=1(cid:2)r(ir)ab + r(jr)ab(cid:3) .

(3.49)

(3.50)

observe that the angular momentum is a vector in so(4) and it has two independent

eigenvalues equal to the rank of so(4).

the above procedure can be easily generalize to superpose hermitian-einstein

connections a to construct solutions for which f is in so(8). for this we consider
complex structures {kq; q = 1, . . . , } on e8 and superpose the hermitian-einstein
connections with respect to each kq. a solution is

aa =



xq=1

(kq)b

abfq

(3.51)

where {fq; q = 1, . . . , } are distinct harmonic functions similar to those in (3.10)
for n = 4. then f spans the subspace 
q=1su(4)  so(8), where each su(4) is
associated with a complex structure {kq; q = 1, . . . , }. there is always a choice

 to nd such solutions the ansatz (2.6) that we are using has to be modied.

22

of complex structures {kq; q = 1, . . . , } such that f spans so(8). the u(1) gauge
eld (3.51) can be used to rotate a fundamental string or a m-2-brane. a spherically

symmetric solution is

aa =



xq=1

(kq)b

ab

q
|x|6

and the angular momentum of the associated spacetime is

(j )ab =



xq=1

q(kq)ab .

(3.52)

(3.53)

in general, j would have four independent eigenvalues equal to the rank of so(8).
we can also do similar superpositions using connections for which f is in sp(2).

for this consider for example the two quaternionic structures on e8,

ir

i

j = i

j(ir)



jr

i

j = i

j(jr)

 ,

(3.54)

where {ir; r = 1, 2, 3} and {jr; r = 1, 2, 3} are those of the so(4) case above. then
the curvature f of the connection

3

ai = x{pi,a}

xr=1

(ir)

i

r(p, a)

|pixi  a|2 + x{pi,a}

3

xr=1

r(p, a)

|pixi  a|2 ,

(3.55)

spans the subspace sp(2)  sp(2)  so(8), where each sp(2) is associated with the
quaternionic structures (3.54) above. it is clear that there are many other ways

of constructing new solutions for example by superposing the dierent methods

proposed above. the angular momentum induced on branes or intersecting branes

by these u(1) gauge elds can be easily computed and we shall not present the

result here. the above results can be easily extended to any suitable dimension.

23

3.5. strings, waves and rotations

it is straightforward to superpose the rotated spacetimes we have constructed
with a pp-wave and a fundamental string for m(8) = e8. the eld equations
simply imply that the functions g1 and g2 associated with the string and the wave
are harmonic functions on e8. moreover, the eld equations for a do not alter with

the addition of the string and the wave and so the expressions that we have given

for a in the previous sections are still valid. the supersymmetry preserved by such

solutions depends on the type of rotation and whether the conguration involves a

wave or a string or both. since the supersymmetry of these congurations without

rotation has been investigated in the literature, here we shall consider three cases

of solutions with (i) rotation and wave, (ii) rotation and string and (iii) rotation,

wave and string. we shall do the analysis without reference to a particular manifold
m(8) and only at the end we shall specialize to m(8) = e8. we shall also choose
 =  1
2 .

(i) for such congurations, we allow f, g2 to depend on x  m(8) and set

g1 = 1. the third killing spinor equation in (2.10) implies that

v = 0

(3.56)

and the remaining reduce to

(3.57)

(cid:0)aea

cabc(cid:1) = 0 .

so for m(8) = e8, these imply that  are constant which satisfy (3.56) and in
addition  satises the second equation in (3.2), i.e. fabab = 0. using the
decomposition (3.5), the solutions of condition (3.56) lie either in the subspace
(1s, 8s) (1s, 8c) or in the subspace (1c, 8c) (1c, 8s) of 16s 16c. the fraction of

24

supersymmetry preserved depends on the way we embed the subalgebra h that f

lies in so(8). if we use the embeddings of [27], then the fractions of supersymmetry
preserved for spinors in the subspaces (1s, 8s)  (1s, 8c) and (1c, 8c)  (1c, 8s) are
summarized in the table below, respectively.

(ii) for such congurations, we allow f, g1 to depend on x  m(8) and set

respectively. to continue, we set



v+ = 0
u = 0 ,

so for m(8) = e8, these imply that  are constant which satisfy (3.58) and in

 the expression is asymmetric in + and 

 which is not conventional. however it is due to
the choice of the frame for our metric. one can nd a symmetric expression using a frame
rotation.

the condition (3.58) lie either in the subspace (1s, 8s) (1c, 8s) or in the subspace
(1c, 8c)  (1s, 8c) of 16s  16c. choosing the embedding of h in so(8) as in case
(i), the fractions of supersymmetry preserved in each of the above two cases are

summarized in the table below, respectively.

4. rotations in toric hyper-kahler spaces

toric hyper-kahler eight-dimensional spaces admit two tri-holomorphic com-

muting killing vector elds. to describe the metric of such space, we introduce the
coordinates {(i, yir); i = 1, 2; r = 1, 2, 3} on m(8), where i are the coordinates
adopted along the killing vector elds. then the metric [28, 12] is

ds2

(8) = u ij(di + i)(dj + j) + uijrsdyirdyjs ,

(4.1)

where i = i,jrdyjr, u ijujk = i

k and

one can nd that

irujk = jruik

tutrsiuujk = [ir|k|,jr] .

uij = u 

ij + x{(p,a)}

(cid:0)(p, a)(cid:1)

pipj

|piyi  a|

,

(4.2)

(4.3)

where {u 
ij } is suitably chosen constant matrix and {(pi, ar); i = 1, 2; r = 1, 2, 3}
are the parameters of the solution. the interpretation of this solution in the context

of strings or m-theory is as superposition of kk-monopoles at sp(2) angles. we

can easily add a wave and a string in the congurations in which case g1 and g2

will be harmonic functions with respect to the (4.1). this equation is considerably

simplied if we take g1 and g2 to be invariant under the killing isometries. in this

case, g1 satises

u ijrsirjsg1 = 0

and similarly for g2. a solution of this equation is

g1 = 1 + x{(p,a)}

(cid:0)(p, a)(cid:1)

1

|piyi  a|

,

(4.4)

(4.5)

and similarly for g2. the parameters {(p, a)} of the metric, g1 and g2 may be
dierent. but if we require for a wave and for a string to lie on each kk-monopole

27

involved in the superposition, the we must take all of them to be the same up to

a scale.

it remains to solve the equation for the rotation. in this case there are two

natural maxwell eld strengths with values in sp(2). the gauge potentials are the

duals of the killing vector elds of the toric hyper-kahler metric, i.e.

a(i) == u ij(dj + j) .

(4.6)

the associated two-form eld strengths f (i) = da(i) are in sp(2) because the killing
vectors elds are tri-holomorphic. moreover f (i), i = 1, 2, solve the maxwell eld

equations either as consequence of the jacobi identity together with the condition

that they lie in sp(2) or equivalently because the toric hyper-kahler spaces are

ricci at [29]. the most general a that can substitute in our ansatz is a linear

combination

a = cia(i) = ciu ij(dj + j)

(4.7)

of the two u(1) gauge potentials above, where {ci, i = 1, 2} is a constant vector.

5. rotations and intersecting branes

there are three dierent orthogonal intersections of ns-5-branes. these are

(i) any two ns-5-branes intersecting on a 3-brane, (ii) any three ns-5-branes in-

tersecting on a string and (iii) any two ns-5-branes intersecting at a string. the

latter intersection can be generalized to a multiple ns-5-brane intersection at sp(2)
angles. all these intersections are associated with a m(8) geometry. in what fol-
lows, we shall be mainly concerned with sp(2)-intersecting ns-5-branes on a string.

to describe the eight-dimensional geometry that arise in this case, we introduce
coordinates {xi; i = 1, 2;  = 1, . . . , 4} on m(8) and two quaternionic structures

jr

i

j = i

jjr





ir

i

j = i

jir



 ,

(5.1)

where {jr; r = 1, 2, 3} and {ir; r = 1, 2, 3} are the quaternionic structures on r4

28

associated with the anti-self-dual and self-dual two-forms, respectively. we remark

that

[jr, is] = 0 .

(5.2)

we can arranged without loss of generality that for this intersection, m(8) is a
hyper-kahler manifold with torsion (hkt) with respect to pair ((+), jr). this
implies that the connection (+) has holonomy sp(2). the metric on m(8) can
be written as

ds2
(8)  abdxadxb = (cid:0)uij + v r

ij(ir)(cid:1)dxidxj ,

(5.3)

where the matrices u, v r have been given in [13] and i, j = 1, 2; ,  = 1, . . . , 4.

due to (5.2), the above metric is hermitian with respect to jr as required. these

geometries are constructed by pulling-back with maps

 : h2  h

qi   (qi) = piqi  a

(5.4)

the four-dimensional hkt geometry associated with the ns-5-brane to r8 and
then summing up over the dierent choices of  , where qi = xi1 + ixi2 + jxi3 + kxi4
and the quaternions {(pi, a)} are the parameters of the maps. the details of the
construction of the metric ds2
(8) and of the 3-form h(8) of this geometry will not
be given here. this has been done in [13] where it was also found that the dilaton

is

e2(8) = 

1

4 .

(5.5)

the position of the ns-5-branes involved in the superposition are given by the

kernels of the above maps  . for later use we remark that the metric (5.3) above

has the property

bcabc = 4bcbac .

(5.6)

to add a wave and a string to the above brane intersection, we have to solve

the equations for g1 and g2 in (2.13). using (5.6) and the expression for the dilaton

29

(5.5), we nd that these equations reduce to

i,j ii g1 = 0
i,j ii g2 = 0 .

a class of solutions for these equations is

g1 = 1 + x{(p,a)}

(cid:0)(p, a)(cid:1)
|piqi  a|2

(5.7)

(5.8)

and similarly for g2. in order for a wave and a string to lie on one ns-5-branes,
the parameters {(p, a)} of g1 and g2 should be chosen to be the same as those
of the maps  used to construct the metric (5.3) above. however, for the most
general solution of this type the parameters {(p, a)} of g1, g2 and the metric can
be dierent.

it remains to add rotation to the conguration by solving (2.13) for f . since
m(8) is a complex manifold with respect to three dierent complex structures {jr},
we shall seek solutions for which a is a hermitian-einstein connection with respect

to a complex structure k. an obvious choice for k is as a linear combination of
{jr}. however, unlike the situation in the at case, here the hermitian-einstein
condition on f with respect to such a choice of k does not imply the eld equations

(2.13). the diculty lies in the presence of torsion. to proceed, we shall consider
special cases of the geometry (5.3) above for which the manifold m(8) admits at
least another kahler structure with torsion (kt) with respect to a pair ((), i).
we can then show by direct computation using the jacobi identities, the equation

(5.6) and the relation between the metric and torsion in a kt geometry that if

fab = (i)ab ,

(5.9)

then f satises the eld equations (2.13), where  is a constant.

30



((), i3).

there are two special cases that we shall consider the following: (i) we shall
require that the geometry m(8) admits another kt structure with respect to the
if this is the case, then the holonomy of () is su(4). to
pair
construct the metric and torsion of this geometry, we simply require that the
parameters {pi; i = 1, 2} of the linear maps  are complex numbers instead of
quaternions. the metric (5.3) becomes

ds2
(8)  abdxadxb = (cid:0)uij + vij(i3)(cid:1)dxidxj ,

(5.10)

where v = v3 and v1 = v2 = 0. choosing complex coordinates with respect to i3,

the metric (5.10) is rewritten as

ds2

(8)  abdxadxb = zij dzidxj  = (cid:0)uij + ivij(cid:1) dzidxj  .

(5.11)

the hermitian-einstein condition for k = i3 implies that

fi,j = 0
z ij fi,j  = 0 .

we again solve the rst equation by setting

ai = iu
ai  = i  u

substituting this in the second equation in (5.12), we nd that

or

z ij ij (cid:0)u  u(cid:1) = 0

i,j ij(cid:0)u  u(cid:1) = 0

(5.12)

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

in real coordinates. this is precisely the equation that g1 and g2 for the string and

the wave satisfy, so it can be solved in a similar way. to summarize, the solution

 we can obviously instead of i3 choose any of the other two complex structures i1 and i2 or
even a linear combination of all three complex structures. but all these cases are symmetric,
so by choosing i3 there is no loss of generality.

and {pi} are complex numbers. we remark that for the most general solution of
this type the parameters {(p, a)} of g1, g2 and of the metric can be dierent. the
physical interpretation of the solution above is that for every pair of parameters

(p, a) it corresponds a wave with charge 2(cid:0)(p, a)(cid:1) on string with charge 1(cid:0)(p, a)(cid:1)
both on a 5-brane with charge 5(cid:0)(p, a)(cid:1) located at

piqi  a = 0 .

in addition each 5-brane has angular momentum

j = (cid:0)(p, a)(cid:1)i3 .

(5.18)

(5.19)

notice that for every pair of 5-branes associated with the maps (,  ) intersect
on a string located at  1(0)   1(0). so the solutions has the interpretation of
waves on strings on rotating sp(2)-intersecting ns-5-branes.

the two rows with the fractions of supersymmetry correspond to the two pos-
sibilities of letting the solutions of v+ = 0 to be either in (1s, 8s) or in (1c, 8c)
subspaces of 16s, respectively. for computing the above fractions of supersym-
metry, we have used the orientation on e8 that it is induced from the complex

structures jr to write the chirality operator in eight-dimensions. moreover observe
that the complex structures ir give the same orientation on e8 as that of the com-
plex structures jr. this is unlike the situation in e4 where the self-dual ir and
anti-self-dual jr complex structures induce opposite orientations.

(ii) we shall require that the geometry m(8) admits another hkt structure
with respect to ((), ir). in this case the holonomy of both connections () and
() is sp(2). to construct the metric and torsion of this geometry, we simply
require that the parameters {pi; i = 1, 2} of the linear maps  are real numbers
instead of quaternions [12, 13]. the metric (5.3) becomes

ds2

(8)  abdxadxb = uijdxidxj ,

(5.20)

where v1 = v2 = v3 = 0. now we take f to be in sp(2), i.e.

fi,j (ir)

 = fi,j

(no summation over r). since this is a special case of the hermitian-einstein

condition, any connection that satises (5.21) also solves the eld equations (2.13).

the equation (5.21) can be solved as in the at case. so to summarize, the solution

in this case is

the two rows with the fractions of supersymmetry correspond to the two pos-

34

sibilities of letting the solutions of v+ = 0 to be either in (1s, 8s) or in (1c, 8c)
subspaces of 16s, respectively. we remark that the same fractions of supersymme-

try are preserved by the associated toric hyper-kahler solutions of section three.

a special case of this class of solutions is to take the ratios p1/p2 of the param-
eters {pi; 1, 2} of all maps  used to construct the background 5-brane intersecting
geometry to be the same. the resulting solution has then the interpretation of
parallel 5-branes. in this case, the holonomy of the connections (+) and () is
sp(1). moreover we can add rotations, waves and strings as above. we may also
take the ratios p1/p2 of the parameters {pi; 1, 2} that appear in the expressions
for g1 and g2 in (5.23) to be the same as those of the parameters of the maps 

that are used in the construction of the metric. the resulting solution will have

the interpretation of parallel 5-branes with waves and strings. the supersymmetry

preserved by this solution is summarized in the following table:

the same fractions of supersymmetry are preserved for both choices of the

projection v+.

there is also a third possibility for which by suitably restricting the parameters
{pi} of the maps  the connection () has holonomy spin(7). this suggests that
we may be able nd rotations for which f is in spin(7). we shall not further

explore this here.

we nally remark that the solutions (5.17) and (5.22) are not the most general

ones of the killing and eld equations with the above interpretation. they should

be rather thought as describing the asymptotic behaviour of more general solutions

35

near the transverse spatial innity. it is expected that these more general solutions

exist and this will be exploited to investigate the geometry near the ns-5-brane

intersections in section eight.

6. rotations and ricci flat cones

so far we have chosen eight-dimensional manifolds m(8) that are asymptoti-
cally at. however, our ansatz allows many other choices of m(8). one of them is
that of a ricci-at cone c(n(7)) over a seven-dimensional manifold n(7). to pre-
serve some supersymmetry, the manifolds n(7) are chosen such that their associated
cones have holonomy su(n), n = 2, 3, 4 (calabi-yau), sp(2) (hyper-kahler), g2
and spin(7). moreover the dilaton (8) is constant and the three-form eld strength
h(8) vanishes. the metric on m(8) is

ds2

(8) = dr2 + r2ds2

(7) ,

where

ds2

(7) = hijdyidyj

(6.1)

(6.2)

in many cases, m(8) are

singular at r = 0. such eight-dimensional geometries have recently appear in the

investigation of near horizon geometries of the m-2-brane and of the m-5-brane

[15].

a class of solutions with a string and a wave can be found by assuming that

g1 and g2 are functions of the radial coordinate r. in this case, we have that

m1
g1 = 1 +
r6
m2
r6 .

g2 =

(6.3)

obviously more general solutions can be found by taking g1 and g2 to be general
harmonic functions on c(n(7)) and therefore to depend on the coordinates of n(7)

36

as well. the equation of motion for f can be rewritten as

j(cid:0)hhjkfkr(cid:1) = 0
j(cid:0)r3hhjkhifk(cid:1) + r(cid:0)r5hhifr(cid:1) = 0 .

(6.4)

now if fri = 0 and fij = fij(y), then f is a harmonic two-form on n(7). such
solutions are then associated with principal u(1) bundles l over n(7). for trivial
. so
bundles, the rotation can be eliminated with a coordinate transformation



the interesting cases are those associated with non-trivial bundles. this requires
that the second betti number of n(7) to be non-vanishing. many such examples
have been constructed. these include the tri-sasakian manifolds of [30] which give

rise to hyper-kahler cones, and their associated by squashing weak g2 holonomy

seven-dimensional manifolds which give rise to cones with spin(7) holonomy. other

examples include some of the sasaki-einstein spaces of [31] which are associated

with calabi-yau cones. if a vanishes our solutions specialize those considered in

[14, 15].

it is clear that as r  , our solutions are asymptotically l  r, where l is
a principal u(1) bundle over c(n(7)) induced from the principal u(1) bundle on
n(7). since these spacetimes are not asymptotically at, a is not straightforwardly
related to angular momentum at innity. the fractions supersymmetry preserved

by our solutions are summarized in the following table:

for the calculation of the above fractions, we have assumed that f is generic

and so the maxwell killing spinor equation does not admit any non trivial solutions.

 we assume that the connection is also trivial.

37

in this case the above fractions do not alter with the addition of strings and waves

in the conguration. the two supersymmetry rows correspond to the choice of
taking the solutions of v+ = 0 to be either in (1s, 8s) or in (1c, 8c), respectively.

7. m-theory

the solutions that we have described in the previous sections as solutions of iia

string theory can be easily lifted to m-theory. for this let z be the eleventh coordi-

nate. the relevant kaluza-klein ansatz



for the reduction from eleven dimensions

to ten is

4

3 dz2 + e 2

3 ds2

(10)

ds2

(11) = e
g4 = h  dz ,

(7.1)

where  is the ten-dimensional dilaton, the ten-dimensional metric ds2

(10) is in the
string frame, g4 is the 4-form eld strength of eleven-dimensional supergravity
and h is the ten-dimensional nsns three-form eld strength. the lifting to
m-theory of solutions given by the ansatz (2.6) is

2. since this solution of m-theory is constructed from lifting a solution
of iia string theory is not localized in the z direction. it turns out that we can

modify our ansatz in eleven dimensions to allow localization of g2 associated with

the wave as it has been done in the special case investigated in [10]. however in

what follows this property of g2 will not be used and so we shall not elaborate

further on this point.

 we have not included in this ansatz the kaluza-klein vector and the iia four-form eld

strength because they vanish for our ten-dimensional solutions.

38

it is well known that iia strings lift to m-theory as m-2-branes, pp-waves

lift again as pp-waves and ns-5-branes lift as m-5-branes. moreover it turns out

that the rotation associated with the abelian eld-strength a also lifts as a rota-

tion. the worldvolume coordinates of the m-2-brane are (u, v, z). following this

iia/m-theory duality correspondence interpretation of the lifted solutions of the

iia solutions that we have found in the previous sections is straightforward. we

remark that it is not necessary to localize a in the z coordinate. this is because

the number of transverse directions of the m-2-brane is the same as number of

transverse directions of the iia string. for example the wave on a rotating string

solution of section (3.5) is lifted to m-theory as

ds2

(11) = g

where g1 and g2 are harmonic functions on e8 and the eld strength f of a is in
su(4) or in spin(7) or in so(8). the explicit expressions of a in all three cases have

been given in sections (3.1), (3.3) and (3.4), respectively. the angular momentum

is the same as that we have computed in the context of iia strings.

as another example, we lift the solutions for which m(8) is a ricci-at cone of

section six. the resulting m-theory solution is

ds2

(11) = g

where g1 and g2 are given in (6.3) and a is a connection of a principal u(1) bundle
on n(7) for which f is harmonic.

finally, the rotating rotated intersecting branes of section ve are lifted as

where e2(8) is given (5.5), and g1, g2 and a are given in (5.17) in case (i) or in
(5.23) for case (ii). for a = 0, the lifting has been described in [13].

8. near horizon geometries

8.1. sp(2)-intersecting ns-5-branes

we shall rst consider the near horizon geometry of two ns-5-branes intersect-

ing at angles on a string associated with the maps 1 and 2, respectively. moreover
let us assume that  1
2 (0) = {x} is a point in h2; in such case the two
ns-5-branes intersect on string. next, we change coordinates in h2 as follows:

1 (0)   1

x = 1(qi)
y = 2(qi) .

(8.1)

this change of coordinates is an invertible transformation. the metric and three-

form eld strength in these new coordinates can be re-expressed as

r2
1

|x|2 (|dx|2 + |x|2ds2(s3))

ds2 = ds2(e(1,1)) + ds2

 +

r2
2

+

|y|2 (|dy|2 + |y|2ds2(s3))
2vol(s3) ,
1vol(s3) + r2

h = r2

(8.2)

where vol(s3) is the volume form of s3, ds2
the transverse spatial innity, and r2

 is the constant asymptotic metric at
2 = (2) are constants. now

1 = (1) and r2

40

1 and |y|2 << r2

in the limit that both |x|2 << r2
2, the constant asymptotic part
of the metric can be neglected and the near horizon geometry is e(1,3)  s3  s3.
this near horizon geometry is exactly the same as that one nds for orthogonally
intersecting ns-5-branes for which the asymptotic constant metric is ds2
 = |dx|2+
|dy|2.

next consider the case where more than two branes are involved in the inter-

section. it suces to consider the case of three intersecting branes associated with

the maps 1, 2 and 3, respectively. this is because the arguments that we shall

present to determine the near horizon geometry in this case can be easily extended
to n branes. we shall take that the sets  1
2 (0)   1
intersect on a point and  1

1 (0),  1
3 (0) pairwise to
3 (0) = , i.e. in dierential topology
in particular, the latter

terminology the three branes are in general position

1 (0)   1

2 (0) and  1



.

condition implies that not all three branes intersect on the same string. now as

we approach the intersection region of the branes associated with say the maps 1

and 2, the metric is dominated by the x and y coordinates adapted to these two

branes. this is because by assumption the intersections of all three branes are well

separated. so the near horizon geometry at the intersection of the above pair of
branes is e(1,3)  s3  s3 as for the two brane intersection above, and similarly for
the near horizon geometry at the intersection of the other two pairs.

8.2. rotating sp(2)-intersecting ns-5- and m-5-branes

to nd a smooth geometry near the pairwise sp(2)-intersection of rotating

ns-5-branes superposed with strings and waves, we have to seek for more general

solutions from those found in section (5). for these new solutions, the functions

g1, g2 associated with the string and the wave, and the u(1) gauge eld a are again

solutions of (5.7) and (5.15), respectively, but they should have dierent asymptotic

behaviour near the intersection regions from those of (5.17). unfortunately, we

were not able to solve the equations (5.7) and (5.15) exactly. so to achieve our

 this assumption appears to be necessary because otherwise the metric is singular.

41

purpose we shall construct an approximate solution near the horizon which has

the desirable behaviour. this is related to the observation in [32] that generalized

harmonic function equations simplify near horizons.

we shall rst consider strings and waves in the background of two sp(2)-

intersecting ns-5-branes on a string. to proceed we shall rst estimate the be-
haviour of the inverse of the metric  of m(8) associated with the solution (8.2) in
the limit |x|2 << r2

2. it is easy to see that schematically

1 and |y|2 << r2

1 = 1

h + o(cid:0)(cid:0)

r

r(cid:1)4(cid:1)

where 1
h

is the inverse of the metric

h =

r2

|y|2 (dydy + |y|2ds2(s3)) ,

(8.3)

(8.4)

i.e. the inverse of the metric near the intersection, and (r/r)2 denotes ratios of the
type (|x|/r1)2, (|y|/r2)2, (|x||y|/r2r1). using this we can estimate the solutions
of g1, g2 and a of (5.7) and (5.15) in the same limit. in particular, a solution for

g1 is

g1 = 1

1r2
r2
2
r2
1r2
2

+ o(cid:0)(cid:0)

r

r (cid:1)2(cid:1)

and similarly for g2, where r1 = |x| and r2 = |y|. a solution for a is

a = 

1r2
r2
2
2 (cid:0)3 + 3(cid:1) + o(cid:0)(cid:0)
1r2

(8.6)

(8.7)

(8.8)

are left invariant one-forms on s3  s3. it is clear that in both the above cases the
rst order term dominates in the limit r2
2. so the metric

(8.9)

after a redenition of the various constants, the near horizon geometry of strings

and waves on two rotating sp(2)-intersecting ns-5-branes on a string is the same

as that of the associated orthogonal intersection investigated in [16, 17]. so we nd
after a coordinate transformation that the metric (8.9) is ads3  s3  s3  e. in
general the geometry near the intersection of every pair of waves on strings on n

rotating sp(2)-intersecting ns-5- branes, for which the ns-5-branes are in general
position, is ads3  s3  s3  e. this follows from the more detail analysis of
previous section. we remark that it appears that the approximate solutions (8.5)
above have the appropriate decay as |x|2 >> r2
2 to match the
solutions given in (5.17) at the spatial transverse innity region. however a more

1 and |y|2 >> r2

detail analysis is needed to establish this.

as we have seen this solution is lifted to m-theory to another solution with

the interpretation of membranes ending on rotating sp(2)-intersecting m-5-branes

superposed with waves. the investigation of the near horizon geometry in this

case is very similar to the one presented above. so we shall not repeat the analysis

here. in particular we nd that near the intersection of every pair of m-5-branes
the geometry is ads3  s3 3 e2.
geometry of the associated orthogonal intersection investigated in [10].

in fact it is the same as the near horizon

43

9. null compactications

compactications of m-theory (or strings) to 11 k dimensions involve super-
gravity solutions of the form e(1,10k)n(k), where n(k) is a compact manifold. a
large class of such solutions can be given by taking n(k) to be one of the manifolds
with special holonomy. these include manifolds with holonomy su(n), n = 2, 3, 4
(calabi-yau), sp(2) (hyper-kahler), g2 and spin(7). such manifolds n(k) solve
the supergravity eld equations and preserve some of the spacetime supersymme-

try provided that we take the various form eld strengths to vanish and the dilaton

to be constant.

our ansatz (2.6) allows the construction of solutions of strings and m-theory

associated with new compactications that have the topology of a u(1) principal
bundle l over the manifolds associated with above standard compactications.
however in this case, the compact direction along the bre direction of l is null
and the string or membrane form eld strength gets an non-zero expectation value.

null compactications of gravity theories has been investigated in the past, see for

example in [18]. here we propose an adaptation of these compactications in

the context of strings and m-theory. to nd such solutions, we set g1 = 1 and
in addition, let l be a principal u(1) bundle over
g2 = 0 in our ansatz (2.6).
n(k) equipped with a connection a with curvature f . then, the manifold m(8)
has topology r7k  l. the eld equations require that f is a harmonic two-
form on n(k). now if l is topologically trivial, then f = 0 and the solution is
r9k  s1 n(k). so for non-trivial solutions we should take l to be topologically
non-trivial. supersymmetry imposes additional conditions on f but these depend
on the properties of n(k) and l and they will be investigated below.

44

9.1. null toric compactifications

the simplest case to consider is n(k) = t k. let {xa; a = 1, . . . , k} be the peri-
odic angular coordinates on t k with periodicities {ra; a = 1, . . . , k}, respectively.
we write the metric of t 8 as

ds2 = abdxadxb ,

(9.1)

where {ab} is a constant matrix. the eld equations for a imply that f =
2fabdxa  dxb is constant. this in turn implies that

1

aa = fabxb + ca ,

(9.2)

where c is a constant. given a basis {ca; a = 1, . . . , k} of h1(t k, z) adapted to
this coordinate system, we nd the dual basis {a; a = 1, . . . , k} in h 1(t k, z),
where

a =

1
ra dxa ;

(9.3)

(no summation over the index a). a basis in h 2(t k, z) can then be found by

taking

for a < b. rewriting f in this basis, we get

ab = a  b

f = fabab .

(9.4)

(9.5)

for f to be the curvature of a line bundle it is required that all the constants

fab are integers. this gives a large class of supergravity solutions with rotation.

for generic choices of f such solutions preserve 1/4 of supersymmetry. there are

special choices of f for which more supersymmetry is preserved by the solution.
for example, one can introduce a complex structure on t k, k even, and look for

connections that satisfy the hermitian-einstein condition. there are many such

connections which will lead to solutions that will preserve more supersymmetry.

we shall not further elaborate on this point here.

45

9.2. null calabi-yau compactifications

on manifolds with at least one complex structure the most natural super-

symmetry condition to impose on f is to require that a is a hermitian-einstein
condition. let n(k) be a calabi-yau manifold with metric  and complex structure
i. the hermitian-einstein condition becomes

f = 0
 f  = 0 ,

(9.6)

in complex coordinates with respect to i. moreover, the above two conditions
imply that f satises the maxwell equations on n(k). it is well known that the
rst condition has solutions provided that the l is holomorphic. so it remains to
nd the conditions required for the second equation in (9.6) to have solutions. for

this we dene the k-form

 = 

k

2 1
i

 c1(l) ,

(9.7)

where i is the kahler form of i and c1(l) is the rst chern class of l. it turns
out that a necessary and sucient condition for the existence of a connection that

satises the second equation in (9.6) is that

 = 0 ;

z

n(k)

(9.8)

(see for example [33] and references within). it would be of interest to investigate

the small uctuations of string and m-theory around such compactications. the

fraction of supersymmetry preserved by such null compactications is the same as

that of the associated calabi-yau ones.

these considerations can be extended to compactications for which n(k) is
hyper-kahler, g2 or spin(7) [34]. it is natural to impose that f is in sp( k
4 ), g2 or
spin(7), respectively. it is clear that to nd solutions to these equations, l must
be restricted appropriately in a way similar to the hermitian-einstein case in (9.8).

46

10. concluding remarks

we have investigated the various ways of adding angular momentum to branes

preserving supersymmetry. the resulting congurations have the interpretation

of rotating branes. we have applied our methods to added rotation to sp(2)-

intersecting ns-5-branes on a string with superposed strings and pp-waves.

in

this way, we constructed new solutions with the interpretation of rotating rotated

branes. superpositions with strings, waves and membranes were also considered

where appropriate. we then explored the related m-theory congurations. we also

found approximate solutions of rotating rotated ns-5-branes in type ii strings and
of rotating rotated m-branes in m-theory with near horizon geometries ads3 
s3  s3  e and ads3  s3  s3  e2, respectively. our results can also be
adapted in the context of d-branes by using t- and s-duality. moreover, we have

presented compact solutions that can be used for null compactications of strings

and m-theory.

an application of our solutions is in the context of ve-dimensional black holes.

since in ve dimensions a three-form eld strength is dual of a two-form one.

we can rst reduce many of our solutions to ve dimensions and then dualize

the three-form eld strength. the resulting solutions will be a supersymmetric

rotating black hole solution with various u(1) charges. it would be of interest to

investigate these ve-dimensional black hole solutions in the future. it is also well

known that there is a correspondence between supergravity solutions and brane

worldvolume solitons. if this correspondence holds in this case, then there must be

worldvolume solutions that have the interpretation rotating branes and preserve the

same fraction of supersymmetry as that of the associated supergravity solutions.

a large class of supergravity solutions has been constructed by superposing

or intersecting a small number of elementary ones using some superposition or

intersection rules. these superpositions can involve a large number of elementary

solutions. the success of this method can be easily demonstrated by the increas-

ing complexity and variety of the superposed solutions. however further progress

47

towards understanding the supergravity solutions will depend on the number and

interpretation of elementary solutions, as well as the development of geometric

methods to treat manifolds that are equipped with natural k-forms. global charges

and their algebras may be useful to nd the elementary solutions [35, 36]. how-

ever no all global charges appear in the supersymmetry algebra, like for example

the angular momentum for asymptotically at spacetimes. since most of the so-

lutions that have been found preserve a proportion of spacetime supersymmetry,

they admit connections, some with torsion, that have special holonomy. in this

respect they are closely related to well known special holonomy manifolds like the

hyper-kahler and calabi-yau ones. if this is the case, then this correspondence

indicates that many of the solutions that have been constructed represent special

points in the moduli space of all possible solutions with the same holonomy and

similar interpretation. some evidence that this may be the case has been provided

in [37]. however since in the context of branes connections that appear are not

the levi-civita ones many of the key properties of the standard special holonomy

manifolds do not generalize. nevertheless, it is likely that new methods can be

developed in the near future to investigate many of the properties of supergravity

solutions.

appendix

t-duality, d-branes and rotations

the type ii t-duality and type iib s-duality can be used to construct rotating

d-branes beginning from the rotating fundamental iib string of section (3.5). for

this we assume that the original solution is independent from the compactifying

coordinate x that the t-duality is performed and that the u(1) gauge potential

a associated with the rotation does not have components along x. for example

performing one s-duality and two t-dualities on the fundamental iib string, we

nd the metric of a rotating d-3-brane as follows:

ds2 = g

 1
2

1 (cid:0)2dv(du + a) + ds2(e2)(cid:1) + g

1
2

1 ds2(e6) ,

(a.1)

where g1 is a harmonic function on e6 and a is a solution of the maxwell eld
equations in e6. such solutions for a have been given in section (3). in particular,

one such solution is that given by requiring that f is in su(3). the d-3-brane then

has angular momentum proportional to the complex structure associated with the

embedding of su(3) in so(6). a preliminary computation has revealed that the near

horizon geometry of this rotating d-3-brane solution may be singular. however

further investigation is required to establish this.

in addition t-dualizing twice and s-dualizing once the above rotating d-3-

brane, we nd a new rotating ns-5-brane solution with metric

ds2 = (cid:0)2dv(du + a) + ds2(e4)(cid:1) + g1ds2(e4) ,

(a.2)

where g1 is harmonic function in e4 and a satises the maxwell equations. this
appears to contradict the eld equations for f found in section (2). however this

is not the case. the resolution of this puzzle is that there is a more general ansatz

than the one we have used to add rotation to branes. this will be investigated in

the future.
