abstract

inspired by a work of brace, morariu and zumino, we give a simple proof that the type

iia/iib eective actions compactied on t d are generically invariant under the t-duality

group so(d, d; z) when r-r potentials are combined suitably with ns-ns 2-form and

transform as a majorana-weyl spinor of so(d, d; z).

1 introduction

recent developments in string theory have been based on various kinds of duality sym-

metries. among them, the t-duality was found rst [1, 2], the role of which is to change

the size of the compactied space into its inverse in string unit. though this symmetry

was rst recognized in the spectra of perturbative strings, it came to be believed that

this should hold as an exact symmetry not simply as a perturbative one [3]. moreover,

supergravities in various dimensions were shown also to have this symmetry if they can be

obtained from 10-dimensional type iia/iib supergravities through dimensional reduction

on a d-dimensional torus t d. this fact is well understood for the ns-ns sector of su-

pergravity action [4]. there the kinetic term of the kaluza-klein (kk) scalars (gij, bij)
(i, j = 1, ..., d) can be written as1

lns = e2 tr(cid:16)m 1m(cid:17)

with

m = (mrs) =   g1

bg1 g  bg1b!

g1b

(1.1)

(1.2)

and  the (10d)-dimensional dilaton. thus the kinetic term is manifestly invariant under
t-duality transformations   o(d, d, z) if the dilaton does not change and m = (m rs)
(r, s = 1, .., 2d) transforms as

m = (cid:16)1(cid:17)t

 m  1.

(1.3)

furthermore, the kk gauge elds (gi, bi) give a vector representation of o(d, d; z) [4].

on the other hand, as for the sector including r-r potentials, the invariance of the

action under the full o(d, d; z) do not seem manifest in the literature to our knowledge,

although some results are obtained for nahm transformations which generate a subgroup

of o(d, d; z) [5]. recently, a nice observation was made by brace, morariu and zumino

that the invariance would be established if the dimensionally-reduced action could be

rewritten as

1 this bij will be denoted as b(0)

ij

in the following sections to notify that this is a scalar for the

lr = d s(m) d,

(1.4)

noncompact (10  d)-dimensional space-time with coordinates x ( = 0, 1, ..., 9d).

2

where s(m) (,  = 1, ..., 2d) is the representation matrix of m in the majorana rep-

resentation of o(d, d; r), and d = (d) assembles relevant r-r potentials suitably com-

bined with ns-ns 2-forms as will be dened later. then, the invariance becomes apparent

if the d transforms as a majorana spinor under o(d, d; z):

d = s()d.

(1.5)

furthermore if we think only about the dualities that transforms within either type iia

or type iib, then d = (d) will have a denite chirality and thus reduces to a majorana-

weyl spinor. the main aim of this paper is to present a simple proof for this statement

with arbitrary d, and to generalize it in such a way that kk gauge elds of higher degrees

are also included.

the present paper is organized as follows. in section 2, in order to x our conventions,

we rst give a brief review on the invariance of the ns-ns sector and then introduce new

potentials d. in section 3, we explicitly construct the spinor representations of o(d, d; z)

closely following [6, 7], and then rewrite the r-r kinetic term in section 4. section 5 is

devoted to discussions.

2 type iia/iib eective actions

ten-dimensional type iia/iib supergravity has the following bosonic action in terms of

the string metric [8]:

sns =

1
22

sr = 

(2.1)

1

bg(cid:19)
2 |ch3|2

s = sns + sr + scs

10 z d10xqbg e2b(cid:18)br + 4|db|2
bg 
10 z d10xqbg xp |bfp+2|2
bg.

1
82

here p runs over p = 0, 2, 4, ... for type iia, and p = 1, 1, 3, ... for type iib. the x ( =
0, 1, 2, ..., 9) are 10-dimensional coordinates, and we denote the 10-dimensional metric,
ns-ns 2-form and dilaton as bg, bb and b, respectively. the ns-ns eld strength is
written as ch3 = dbb2 with bb2 = (1/2)bbdx  dx. we adopt a rule that the subscript of
consider a sum of forms of various degrees like b = pk bk = pk(1/k!)b1...k dx1 

a form stands for its degree when it has a denite meaning in 10 dimensions. we also often

3

    dxk , and for this we introduce the invariant norm as

1

2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
bg  xk

k! bg 1 1   bg k k b1...kb1...k.

the r-r eld strengths bfp+2 are dened as

bf1 = dc0,
bf3 = dc2 + ch3  c0,
bf5 = dc4 + 1

2ch3  c2  1

2 bb2  dc2.

bf2 = dc1,
bf4 = dc3 +ch3  c1,

(2.2)

(2.3)

the last term scs in (2.1) is the chern-simons term [8]. we do not write down its explicit

form here since this term is not relevant to our discussion.

when the ten-dimensional space-time is compactied on a d-dimensional torus, some

of the ns-ns and r-r elds become scalars or forms of higher degrees for the noncompact
(10  d)-dimensional space-time. we parametrize the 10-dimensional metric as

dbs2  bgdxdx

= gdxdx + gij(dyi + ai

dx)(dyj + aj

dx).

(2.4)

here the 10-dimensional coordinates are decomposed as (x) = (x, yi) ( = 0, 1, ..., 9
d; i = 1, 2, ..., d), and we assume that all the elds depend only on x. with this

parametrization, the kinetic term for potentials will take a complicated form since the

kaluza-klein gauge eld

a(1) i  ai

dx

(2.5)

will appear when contracting the indices o-diagonally. to simplify this, we follow the

prescription of [4] which we found can be stated as follows. first, given a sum of forms

b =pk bk, we decompose it as
b =xq xn

n! b(q)
where the superscript (q) indicates that b(q)

1

1

i1...in dyi1      dyin,

i1...in is a q-form for noncompact indices:

(2.6)

(2.7)

i1...in =

b(q)

q! b1...q i1...indx1      dxq .

4

second, we introduce a new form  by replacing dyi in b with dyia(1) i, and re-organize

it as in (2.6):

  b(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)dyidyia(1) i
= xq xn

1
n!

 (q)
i1...in dyi1      dyin.

(2.8)

then the kinetic term can be expressed in such a way that all the indices are contracted

only with g or gij:

,

for example, the ns-ns eld strength ch3 is rewritten as

g,g

(2.19)

this form of action makes manifest its invariance under the t-duality group o(d, d; z)

provided that the elds transform as

m = (cid:16)1(cid:17)t

 m  1 ,

(2.20)

the rst transformation rule is equivalent to the following one for eij = gij + b(0)

ij and

 =  a

c

b

d!  o(d, d, z) [3]:

e = (ae + b)(ce + d)1.

(2.21)

on the other hand, after toroidal compactication, r-r potentials cp+1 = (1/(p +
1)!) c1...p+1 dx1      dxp+1 will produce kk forms of various degrees. to simplify

6

the transformation laws of these kk forms, we rst combine the r-r potentials with the

ns-ns 2-form in 10 dimensions as follows:

d0  c0,
d2  c2 + bb2  c0,
d4  c4 + 1

2 bb2  c2 + 1

2 bb2  bb2  c0.

the r-r eld strengths are then expressed with these d as

bf1 = dd0,
bf3 = dd2  bb2  dd0,
bf5 = dd4  bb2  dd2 + 1

these can be written in a simple form

2 bb2  bb2  dd0.
bf = ebb2  dd

if we introduce

d1  c1,
d3  c3 + bb2  c1,

bf2 = dd1,
bf4 = dd3  bb2  dd1,

furthermore, as we did for ns-ns elds, we introduce the primed eld for bf as

then the kinetic term will be expressed as

d  xp

dp+1,

bf  xp bfp+2.
f   bf (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)dyidyia(1) i .

lr = 

1

g | f  |2

g,g .

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

to show that lr is invariant under o(d, d; z) when d transforms as a majorana
spinor of o(d, d; z), we in the next section explicitly construct the spinor representation

of o(d, d; r) by using fermionic operators. we mostly follow the convention of [6, 7].

3 spinor representation of o(d, d; r)

we rst recall that the group o(d, d; r) consists of 2d  2d matrices  satisfying

j =  0

1d

1d

0 ! .

t j  = j,

7

(3.1)

the group o(d, d; z) is dened as a subgroup that consists of matrices with integer-valued

elements. it is known that both are generated by the following three types of matrices

[9]:

0

b =   1 b
1 ! ,
r =   r1
rt! ,
i =   1  ei ei
1  ei! ,

ei

0

0

bt = b,

r  gl(d),

(3.2)

(3.3)

(ei)jk = ijik,

(i = 1, ..., d).

(3.4)

note that det b = det r = +1 and det i = 1. thus one can construct a subgroup
so(d, d; r) or so(d, d; z) as such that are generated by b, r and ij.

the dirac matrices r = (r

) are introduced as

{r, s} = 2j rs

(r, s = 1, ..., 2d),

and the spinor representation s() = (s()) is characterized by the property

s()  s  s()1 =xr

rrs.

(3.5)

(3.6)

to construct this representation, we introduce fermionic operators ai and ai with the

anti-commutation relations

{ai, aj} = i

j,

{ai, aj} = 0 = {ai, aj}

(i, j = 1, ..., d).

(3.7)

we dene the hermitian conjugation as

(ai) = ai,

(3.8)

and introduce the vacuum | 0 i such that ai | 0 i = 0 (i = 1, ..., d) and h 0 | 0 i = 1. then
the 2d-dimensional fermion fock space is spanned by the vectors

| i = ai1    ain | 0 i

(n = 0, ..., d),

(3.9)

where  is a multi-index  = (i1, ..., in) (i1 <   < in), and the dirac matrices can be
introduced with respect to this as follows:

ai |  i = x |  i
ai |  i = x |  i

8

1

2(cid:16)i(cid:17)
2(cid:16)d+i(cid:17)

1

.

(3.10)

thus, if we can always introduce an operator  to any element

j)

 =  (ai

(cij)

j)!  o(d, d; r)

(bij)
(di

such that

( aj1, aj1 ) = ( aiai

j + aicij, aibij + aidi

= ( a, a )  a b
d! ,

c

(3.11)

(3.12)

j )

then, introducing the matrix s() by |  i = p | i s(), we can establish the

relation (3.6). for this, it is enough to construct the operators that correspond to the

elements given in (3.2)-(3.4), and it is easy to show that the followings are solutions [6, 7]:

b = eb  exp(cid:18)
r = (det r)1/2 exp(cid:16)aiai

bijaiaj(cid:19) ,
jaj(cid:17)

1
2

i = ai + ai

(i = 1, ..., d).

(cid:16)r =(cid:16)ri

j(cid:17) = exp(cid:16)ai

j(cid:17)(cid:17) ,

(3.13)

notice that all of these operators give real-valued matrix elements, so that the resulting

representation is automatically majorana. note also that the is do not give faithful

representations so that there are always ambiguities in their orderings.

in order to construct weyl representations, we dene a matrix

2d+1 

1
2d

dyi=1

(i + d+i)(i  d+i)

(3.14)

which satises n2d+1, ro = 0 (r = 1, ..., 2d). by looking at the correspondence (3.10),
one can easily see that 2d+1 corresponds to (1)nf with nf = pi aiai. thus, the
projection to the subspace with (1)nf = 1 leads to a majorana-weyl representation
(cid:16)2d1(cid:17)s
. note that i is a linear function

and the other one with (1)nf = 1 to(cid:16)2d1(cid:17)c

of fermions and thus changes the chirality. therefore, in order for an operator to preserve

the chirality it must correspond to an element in so(d, d; r).

we nally introduce the operator j that corresponds to j = (j rs):

where the phase factor is chosen such that j2 = 1. one can actually prove that

j = id(d1)/2 1    d,

j ai j = ai,

j ai j = ai.

9

(3.15)

(3.16)

it is easy to check that for all these s (and thus for all elements in o(d, d; r)), their
transposes t = j  1  j are mapped to :

 = j1j.

in particular, we have



b = eb

= exp(cid:18)1

2

bij aiaj(cid:19) ,

t

0

b =  1

b 1! .

(3.17)

(3.18)

note also that the normalization of the operators (3.13) actually satises the condition

(3.17).

4 r-r potentials on t d and t-duality

in this section, we show that the kinetic term of r-r potentials is actually invariant under

so(d, d; z) if our r-r elds d = (d) transform as a majorana-weyl spinor.

we rst introduce a one-to-one correspondence between the set of forms and that of

operators by relating

 =xn

1
n!

i1...indyi1      dyin =xq xn

1
n!

(q)
i1...indyi1      dyin

to

 xn

1
n!

i1...inai1    ain =xq xn

1
n!

(q)
i1...inai1    ain.

(4.1)

(4.2)

this actually gives an isomorphism as an algebra. we also take a rule that (q)

i1...in has
nf = q, and thus it will anticommute with all the fermionic operators when q is odd. we

dene the corresponding states as

note that the following holds:

| i  | 0 i .

| i = |   i .

(4.3)

(4.4)

now that we have the above isomorphism, we can introduce the operator corresponding

to bf in (2.24):

bf = ebb2 dd.

10

(4.5)

since fp+2 are even/odd forms for type iia/iib, we have (1)nf(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) fe = +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) fe for type
iia and = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) fe for type iib. this implies that each state has a denite chirality and

thus forms a majorana-weyl representation of so(d, d; z). noticing that the replacement
dyi  dyi  a(1) i as in (2.26) is equivalent to the operation
= ai  a(1) i,

ai  eaia(1) i

aieaia(1) i

(4.6)

we can simply express the operator corresponding to f  as

and thus the corresponding state can be written as

f = eaia(1) ibfeaia(1) i

,

(4.7)

| f  i = f | 0 i = eaia(1) ibf| 0 i

= eaia(1) i

ebb2 | dd i = eaia(1) i

ebb2eaia(1) i

 eaia(1) i

| dd i .

here one can use (2.14) to show that

eaia(1) ibb2eaia(1) i

so that we have

=

b(0)

ij aiaj + b(1)

i ai

where

1

b(0)
b(0) 
v  aib(1)

i + aia(1) i.

(4.8)

(4.9)

since (cid:16)b(1)

i

as

, a(1) i(cid:17)t

transforms as a vector for o(d, d; z), one can see that v transforms

v =  v 1

(4.10)

for   so(d, d; z). in fact,

(1)

b

b(1)

v = (a, a)
=  (a, a) 1

a(1)  = (a, a) 

a(1) 
a(1)  =  v 1.

b(1)

11

(4.11)

on the other hand, if we make a block-wise gauss decomposition of m as

m =   1d

0

1d!   g1
b(0)
b(0)  g  b(0),

0

= t

0

g!   1d b(0)
1d !

0

then the corresponding operator m will be written as

m = eb(0) 

g eb(0)

with

g eaihi

j aj

g 

(cid:18)(gij) = e(hi

j)(cid:19) .

this operator g has a special property. in fact, suppose that for a given state

| i =xq xn

1
n!

(q)
i1...in ai1    ain | 0 i ,

we introduce its hermitian conjugate as

h | =xq xn

1
n! h 0 | ain    ai1 10d (q)

i1...in,

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

where 10d is the hodge-dual operation in the noncompact (10  d) dimensions. then
the following identity holds:

d10dxg g | |2

g,g = h | g | i ,

since

g | i = xq xn
= xq xn

so that we have

g
n! (cid:16)eh(cid:17) j1
  (cid:16)eh(cid:17) jn
g
gi1j1    ginjn(q)

h | g | i = xq xn

n! (cid:16)10d(q)
= d10dxg g | |2

i1...in  (q)
g,g .

j1...jn(cid:17) gi1j1    ginjn

setting  = f , we thus have proven that

d10dxg g | f  |2

g,g = h f  | g | f  i .
12

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

furthermore, since this f  is written as in (4.8), we can rewrite the right-hand side as

h | m| i with | i = exp(cid:16)b(2)(cid:17) exp (v)| dd i. since m, v and b(2) transforms as

m =(cid:16)1(cid:17)

m 1,

v =  v 1,

b(2) = b(2),

(4.21)

we thus conclude that the action is invariant under the whole t-duality group so(d, d; z)

if the d = (d)s transform as a majorana-weyl spinor:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) de = | d i .

(4.22)

5 discussion

in the present article, we give a simple proof that the r-r potentials cp+1 transform as

a majorana-weyl spinor under the t-duality group o(d, d; z) if they are combined with

the ns-ns 2-form as in (2.22).

there should be various applications once transformation rules are obtained explicitly

for the whole t-duality group. one will be to establish relations among various classical

solutions of type iia/iib supergravities by using the full t-duality group together with

the s-duality of type iib. the work in this direction is in progress and will be reported

we nally make a comment on the dilaton dependence in r-r gauge potentials assum-

ing that bb2 = 0 for which there is no distinction between the original r-r potential c and
our potential d. usually we expect that another eld strength dened by fp+2 = eb dcp+1
is applicable in the analysis based on r-r vertex operator of nsr strings in a at back-
ground. to see this in our formulation, we rst recall that we have introduced the (10d)-
dimensional dilaton  as a singlet for o(d, d; z). this implies that the 10-dimensional
dilaton b should transform as eb  g1/4. on the other hand, we could have further de-
composed the operator g as g = 
ee where e = (eia) (i, a = 1, ..., d) is a vielbein
for g, g = e et . then one might say that the state e | dc i corresponds to a r-r
vertex in a at background. thus, noticing that the operator e will carry the factor
g1/4, we expect that eb dc will transform as in a at case.
