abstract

we study bps saturated objects with axial geometry (wall junctions, vor-
tices) in generalized wess-zumino models. it is observed that the tension of
such objects is negative in general (although exceptional models are pos-
sible). we show how an ambiguity in the denition of central charges does
not aect physical quantities, and we comment on the stability of the junc-
tions and vortices. we illustrate these issues in two classes of models with zn
symmetry. on the basis of analytical large n calculations and numerical cal-
culations at nite n , we argue that the domain wall junctions in these models
are indeed bps saturated, and we calculate the junction tensions explicitly.

1 introduction

studying the bps domain walls in supersymmetric theories is interesting, especially
in gauge theories [1], because one can get information on non-trivial dynamical
features. for example, it was found that the tension of such domain walls determines
the decay rate of false vacua in large n supersymmetric gluodynamics [2, 3].

it was noted [4] that theories with either a u(1) or zn global symmetry may
contain bps objects with axial geometry. vortex-like objects which conserve 1/4 of
the original supersymmetry were considered in [5], while domain wall junctions of
the hub and spoke type, which also preserve 1/4 of supersymmetry, were discussed
in [4, 6, 7]. general considerations of the tensorial central charges responsible for the
saturation of the vortices and junctions were presented in [8, 9, 10]. the existence of
bps wall junctions also leads to non-trivial dynamical consequences. for instance,
in [11] the large n behavior of the bps junction tension was used to argue in
favor of soliton-like heavy hadrons with mass proportional to n in supersymmetric
gluodynamics.

the study of possible dynamical implementation of the bps wall junctions has
just begun. apart from the original works in which the existence of such junctions
was rst noted, they were discussed in [11, 12, 13, 14]. in [11] a generalized wess-
zumino model, which we will refer to as model i, with one chiral supereld x and
the superpotential

w = n (x +

was considered. this model is related to the veneziano-yankielowicz [15] eective
lagrangian, which, in turn, models supersymmetric yang-mills theory. the param-
eter n is an integer that corresponds to the the number of colors of the gauge group
su(n) of susy gluodynamics. the superpotential (1) was originally suggested for
that purpose in [16]. at any given n it possesses a zn symmetry which is spon-
taneously broken.
in the large n limit an analytic solution for the bps domain
walls was found in [17]. the most essential feature of the solution is the fact that
the wall width scales as n1, and vanishes at n  . this result, in conjunction
with two bps junction congurations presented in [11] at n = , implies that bps
junctions do exist at large n in the theory with superpotential (1). the junction
tension was found to scale as n 2 at large n.

in [13] the rst analytic solution for a bps junction was found in a specic
generalized wess-zumino model. among stimulating ndings in this work is the
fact that the junction tension turned out to be negative in this model. the model
has z3 symmetry.
it is derived from a su(2) yang-mills theory with extended
supersymmetry (n = 2) and one matter avor perturbed by an adjoint scalar mass.
the original model contains three pairs of chiral superelds and, in addition, one
in fact, for the purpose of studying the bps walls and
extra chiral supereld.
wall junctions, the model can be further simplied.
it can be easily stripped of
its inessential features and cast into the form of a zn symmetric model. (n is an

1

arbitrary integer, not necessarily equal to 3). the generalized and simplied model,
which we refer to as model ii, contains n chiral superelds mk with k = 1, 2, ..., n
and another chiral supereld t . the superpotential is

w = n (a" n

xk=1(cid:16)t  nqk1ei/n(cid:17) m 2

k# + bt) ,

(2)

where q = ei2/n . the constants a and b are assumed to be n independent and
positive.

model i is invariant under the transformation

x(x, )  e2ik/n x(x, ) ,

 = eik/n  ;

the corresponding transformation of the superpotential is

w(x(x, ))  e2ik/nw(x(x, )) .

model ii is invariant under the transformation

(3)

(4)

t (x, )  e2ik/n t (x, ) , ml(x, )  mlk(x, )
the corresponding transformation of the superpotential is

 = eik/n  ;

(5)

w(t (x, ), m(x, ))  e2ik/nw(x(x, ), m(x, )) .

(6)

model i is among the simplest supersymmetric models allowing one to study
bps junctions and calculate tensions. 1 the model has n distinct vacua in which
the scalar component of x takes the vacuum expectation value nei(2k3)/n , with
k = 1, 2, .., n. the perturbative spectrum consists of a chiral multiplet with mass
m = n.

let us now briey discuss the vacuum structure and spectrum of model ii. in
this model there are 2n distinct, physically equivalent vacua. in these vacua the
scalar components of the t and m elds take the vacuum expectation values

t = nei(2k3)/n , mk = s b

a

, ml = 0

for

l 6= k ,

(7)

with k = 1, 2, .., n. the perturbative spectrum contains two chiral multiplets, linear
combinations of the eld t and the eld mk that obtains a vacuum expectation

value, with mass m1,2 = 2abn, and (n  1) chiral multiplets with mass

mk = 4n 2a (1  cos (k  1)/n) ,

(8)

for k = 2, 3, .., n.

1it is worth noticing that in a dierent context its 2-dimensional reduction was studied in [18],

where it was shown to be integrable.

2

apart from the zn symmetry, eq.(5), model ii has additional z n
2

symmetry,
since any of the elds mk can be transformed as mk  mk. the superpotential
in eq.(2) is obviously invariant under this transformation. in our consideration of
the wall junctions below we will disregard the z n
2 symmetry, limiting ourselves just
to a zn family of vacua. (this corresponds to the choice of the + sign in front of

qa/b in eq.(7)). the walls and junctions of the type where (some of) the vacua

lie outside this family may or may not be bps saturated. we leave this issue open
for future investigations.

needless to say that in both models i and ii the walls connecting the distinct
vacua and the corresponding junctions are topologically stable. (the issue of sta-
bility of the bps junctions is discussed separately in sect.(7).) they need not be
bps saturated, generally speaking. we know, empirically, that sometimes in certain
models equations of the bps saturation have no solutions with the proper boundary
conditions [18, 19] even in the case of isolated walls, let alone the wall junctions.

it was known previously that the isolated walls in model i are saturated, see
in appendix a we give an analytical solution to the bps equation for the
[16].
domain walls in model ii for a specic ratio of the parameters a and b; we have
veried numerically that these walls also saturate the bps bounds for other values
of the parameters. in sect.(6) we provide evidence that the domain wall junctions
in models i and ii are also bps saturated. were the walls and junctions non-
saturated, one could still calculate the relevant central charges. they would then
represent lower bounds on the corresponding tensions.

most considerations in this paper concern the basic domain wall junction, the
junction with n sectors in a model with zn symmetry. but in appendix b we
present an analytic solution to the bps equation for the class of triple junctions in
model ii for a specic ratio of the parameters a and b, and n a multiple of three.
for n = 3, the basic junction and the triple junction coincide. non-basic junctions
in model i are studied in [14]. networks of domain walls in model i are studied in
[20, 21].

in this paper we consider bps wall junctions and calculate their tensions in
models i and ii specied above. we also consider general aspects, including the
sign of the tension, the ambiguity of the central charges, and stability, that are valid
beyond model i and ii. these models are used to illustrate the general assertions.
the organization of our paper is as follows. in sect.(2) we describe a general
method to calculate the bps bound on the tension of domain wall junctions. we
show that the junction tension is typically negative, although we do not exclude
exotic models with positive tension. we then use this method to explicitly calculate
the junction tension in models i and ii. (secs. 3 and 4). for model i we calculate
the junction tension analytically in next to leading order in 1/n, and numerically
for nite values of n. for model ii the junction tension is calculated analytically for
all values of n and all values of the parameters a and b. in sect.(5) we show that
ambiguities in the central charges cancel in the calculation of the junction tension,
and we illustrate this cancellation by recalculating the tension in model ii with a

3

dierent denition of the central charges. in sect.(6) we demonstrate by numerical
 and in certain limits, analytical  calculations that in both models i and ii the
wall junctions are, in fact, saturated. in sect.(7) we comment on the stability of the
bps junctions. the appendices contain analytical results for domain walls and the
triple junction in model ii.

2 generalities of the solutions with the axial ge-

ometry

for both models i and ii it is possible to calculate, using the general theory of
the central charges, the bps bounds on the junction tension. the general formula
worked out in [10] implies

m
l

= i akdxk + 2i dnksk,

(9)

where ak is an axial current. at the classical level only the component of the current
built from the scalar elds is important. moreover,

s1,2 = {re, im} ,

(10)

where  is related to the superpotential. the integrals run over the large circle (see
fig.(1)) with r  , and d~x (d~n) is an innitessimal vector along (perpendicular
to) the contour. the precise denitions of ak and  have (correlated) ambiguities.
the sum in eq.(9) is unambiguous, however [10]. the above ambiguity can be
exploited to optimize the calculation of the junction tension. this will be explained
below in two particular applications, model i and ii.

we will consider the wall junction of the hub and spoke type. the following
conventions are convenient (although not necessary). we will orient the wall spokes
as indicated in fig.(1), namely, the hub is at the origin, the rst spoke runs along
the x axis in the positive direction, the second runs at an angle 2/n, and so on.
in the point p the theory sits in the rst vacuum, in the point q in the second,
etc. this conguration is topologically stable.

we will assume that the zn symmetry is realized through multiplication of (some
of) the elds by a phase. this is certainly true in models i and ii. if on the junction
solution (the lowest components of) the elds x, t (generically, ) rotate as

(e2ik/n ) = e2ikr/n () ,

(11)

we will say that the rotation weight of the eld  is equal to r. congurations with
the positive rotation weight will be referred to as junctions (vortices), while those
with the negative weight will be referred to as anti-junctions (anti-vortices). it is
worth reminding that

the bps wall junctions satisfy the equations

where the phase  depends on the phase of the superpotential (see below). the
equations for anti-junctions is

2k = ei  w
 k

,

(14)

i.e.  is replaced by . thus, in our convention the phase of  grows in the anticlock-
wise directions for the junction, and in the clock-wise direction for the anti-junction.
the superpotential can always be chosen in such a way that in the vacuum p
its phase is exp(i/n) while in the vacuum q it is exp(i/n). see fig.(1) for the
denition of p and q. (note that re{w} is then positive in both vacua). then the
phase  in eq. (13) must be set to zero in both models i and ii.
for the wall junctions the rotation weights of x and t are obviously equal to 1.
now, we proceed to discuss general features of the tension associated with wall
junctions. in fig.(1) the energy of the junction conguration (per unit length) is
dened as the integral over the volume energy density over the area inside the circle,
where it is assumed that the circle radius r tends to innity,

e(r) =

m

length

= z|~r|r h(x, y)dxdy = t1r + t2 + ... , r   .

(15)

here the dots denote terms vanishing in the limit r  . it is tempting to say that
t2 is associated with the (1/2, 1/2) central charge while t1 with the (1, 0) central
charge (see eq.(9), the rst and second term, respectively). we hasten to note that
these central charges, being considered individually, are ambiguous [10]. it is only
the combination in eq.(9) which is xed unambiguously. it is intuitively clear that
t1 = ntwall where twall is the tension of the isolated wall. moreover, it is also clear
that t2 (which will be also referred to as tjunction) is typically negative. indeed, from
eq.(15) it follows that, for small r, e(r) = cr2, where c is a numerical coecient.
at large r the quadratic dependence on r changes to linear, see eq.(15). matching
these two scaling laws straightforwardly, connecting the parabola and the straight
line at the value of r where their slope is equal, we conclude that t2 is forced to
be negative. models where it could be positive would require, in essence, two scales
and an intermediate regime between the parabolic and linear regime. in order to
illustrate the typical situation, we plot the energy e as a function of r for model
ii with n = 3, b = 3 and a = b/9 in fig.(3).

actually, this gure gives the energy e dened as the integral over h(x, y) over
the equilateral triangle with distance r from the center to each of the sides instead of
the energy in a circle. the orientation of the triangle is such that each of the sides
is perpendicular to a spoke. we made this modication because for this triangle

model ii with n = 3, a = b/n 2 and b = 3, compared to the line e = t1r + t2
(solid line). this example illustrates the typical junction with negative tension.

the energy converges to the linear relation eq.(15) exponentially fast, whereas for
a circle the departure from the linear behavior is of the order 1/r. (as explained
below, the coecient of the 1/r term is just a geometrical factor taking into account
the curvature of the circle as it intersects the domain wall.)

for the particular values of the parameters that we chose, there is an analytical
wall junction solution of the bps equations, which is presented in appendix b.
the energy e(r) can therefore be calculated exactly and is shown in fig.(3). it is
clear from fig.(3) that even though there is a change from a convex to a concave
regime, e(r) converges to the linear regime so fast that tjunction is negative. the
tensions can be calculated analytically and take the values t1 = 162 (see sect.(6))

and t2 = 273/2 (see sect.(4)). similar graphs for model i junctions are presented

in ref.[14]. for comparison, we sketch what a similar graph would look like for an
exotic model with positive junction tension in fig.(4).

below we give a general prove of the fact that t1 = ntwall, and illustrate more
quantitatively that tjunction is negative in both models i and ii, and in other natu-
ral models. of crucial importance is the fact that the wall width (i.e. the transverse
dimension inside which the energy density is nonvanishing, while outside it vanishes
with exponential accuracy) is nite (i.e. r independent). this width is denoted
by l, see figs. (1) and (2). in both models i and ii, l is actually o(1/n). at the
moment we do not assume n to be large. it can be any integer > 2. if r  , one
can replace the integration domain in eq. (15)  the interior of the circle can be re-
placed by the interior of the circle with the segments removed. if e(r) is dened as
the integral over the interior of the circle with the segments removed, the dierence

e(r)  e(r) tends to zero in the limit r  . (the length of the straight line
dh is l, where l is an arbitrary parameter, l  l  r.) this can be clearly seen
from fig.(2), which presents a detail of the domain near the point g. the area of
the removed segment is o(l3/r). the parameter l does not scale with r when r
tends to , hence the area of the removed segment tends to zero. since the volume
energy density is nite, the dierence e(r)  e(r)  r1.
for the bps saturated conguration the energy e(r) or e(r) can be rewritten
as a combination of the corresponding contour integrals. the master equation for
the wall junction is presented in eq.(9). it is assumed in this equation that the phase
 in eq.(13) is zero, which is the case with our convention. there is an ambiguity
in  and ak in this master formula: a certain reshuing is possible due to the
ambiguity in the denition of the supercurrent and the energy-momentum tensor.
this is explained in great detail in ref.[10]. we will return to the discussion of this
ambiguity later on. for the time being let us stick to the canonic denitions. then

where k = 1, 2. the sum runs over all scalar elds involved in the solution. fields
which are purely real obviously drop out. only complex elds contribute; for such
elds, if  = ei,

ak = 2k .

(18)

note that eq. (17) for the current appearing in the master equation is valid for the
wall junctions. for the anti-junctions one must reverse the sign in eqs. (17) and
(18).

how do we see that with our convention the phase  in eq. (13) is zero? to this
end, let us consider this equation far away from the hub, on the line dh. on this
line eq. (13) becomes

y = i

.

(19)

 w
 

since w = w(q)  w(p ) = 2i|w| sin(/n) in our convention, this is exactly
the bps equation for the (isolated) wall, as it should be since the equation for the
junction should go into the equation for the wall far away from the hub.

to begin with, we will calculate the tension t1. since due to the zn symmetry,
the contributions of each of the n sectors in fig.(1) are identical, it is sucient to
calculate the integral corresponding to one sector,

t1r = 2n zpdhq

d~nksk ,

(20)

where on pd and hq the integral runs along the circle while on dh it runs along
the straight line. on pd and hq the superpotential w assumes the vacuum values

w = |w|vacei/n
and does not change (with exponential accuracy). therefore,

w = |w|vacei/n

where the angle  is dened in fig.(1). on the straight line dh we have

(21)

(22)

with the exponential accuracy the elds on the straight line dh satisfy the bps
equations for the isolated wall, see (19). the solution is known to have an integral
[5]), which with our phase convention is nothing but re{w}.
of motion (see e.g.
thus, re{w} does not change along the line dh and reduces to its vacuum value,
|w|vac cos(/n), which is one and the same in both vacua, p and q. as a result,
the sum of two integrals (21) and (22) is

(23)

(24)

where twall stands for the tension of the isolated bps wall. combining eqs. (20),
(23) and (24) we arrive at

t1 = ntwall ,

(25)

q.e.d.

now we pass to the discussion of the tension t2. according to eq.(9) for the

wall junction tension, t2 is given by the integral over the large circle over

t2 = i d~xkak ,

(26)

where ak is given in eq. (17) or eq. (18). again, we take into account the fact
that all n sectors give one and the same contribution, and we will integrate over
one sector only, starting from p and ending at q. then

t2 = n zpdhq

d~xkak .

(27)

on the intervals pd and hq, the elds assume their vacuum values. they do
not change (with exponential accuracy), and therefore, ak = 0, so that there is no
contribution to t2. a nonvanishing contribution comes from the dh segment of the
integral. on this segment we can disregard the hub and other spokes of the
junction, considering the relevant part of the wall as that of the isolated bps wall.
in model i, there is only one eld, x. in model ii there are n + 1 elds, t
and m. however, for the bps wall, ms assume real values (see appendix a) and,
thus, the elds m do not contribute. let us parametrize the elds x and t as ei.
in both cases (p ) = /n and (q) = /n. then

t2 = n zdh

dy 2(x, y)y(x, y) = nh2i ((q)  (p )) = 2h2i .

(28)

here h2i is the average value of the modulus of the eld on the solution on the
it is the average over the wall. first, we notice that since h2i
segment dh, i.e.
is positive, the value of the junction tension tjunction is negative. the only way to
escape this, is to have some (complex) elds involved in the junction which rotate in
the unnatural direction (i.e. while the natural elds in the junction rotate in the
anticlock-wise direction, this exotic eld must rotate clock-wise). rotation means
here winding of the phase, from smaller to larger values. in addition, the exotic
eld must have the average value of the modulus larger than that of the natural
elds, so that it can overcome the negative contribution to tjunction coming from the
natural elds. in all models considered so far of which we are aware, the exotic
elds do not appear.2

second, we note that h2i inside the wall does not dier too much from its
vacuum value. for instance, in the model ii (see appendix a) the vacuum value

2 let us note in passing that similar consideration determining the sign of the tension t2 is

applicable to the u (1) vortices of the type considered in [5].

10

vac = n 2 while in the middle of the wall |t|middle = n 2[cos(/n)]2. the average
|t|2
value h2i lies between these two extremes. at large n the average value tends to
its vacuum one, h2i = n 2 + o(1).

theorem for bps junctions tjunction is determined, through the master equa-
tion, by the solution for the isolated wall. unlike t1, the domain wall junction is
non-holomorphic, and, generally speaking, depends on the details of the wall solu-
tion. in the limit n   the formula for tjunction becomes universal.

proof
the rst part of the theorem is proved by the consideration preceding eq. (28).

the last part of the theorem will be established below (see also [11]).

3 tjunction from the isolated wall in model i

first, we will illustrate how this works in model i. let us consider this model in
the limit of large n. in this limit the wall junction tension was calculated in [10],
tjunction = 2n 2. the corresponding calculation is trivial. we are now interested
in the leading 1/n correction. it can be found using the solution for the isolated
bps wall obtained in [17]. the eld x is parametrized as

x = n (cid:18)1 



n(cid:19) ei /n ,

(29)

where (y) is a function of y which falls o from  in the middle of the wall (y = 0)
to zero at y = . here  is the positive root of the equation

(1  )e = 1 ,

  1.278 .

(30)

the phase  changes from zero in the middle of the wall (y = 0) to  at y = ,

 () =   arccos ((1  ) exp ) ,

(31)

where we modied the solution presented in [17] to bring it in accordance with our
convention.

(34)

the tension in model i can also be calculated numerically for any value of n. in
fig.(5) we compare the numerically determined tension with the leading and next
to leading analytic approximations for n = 2k and k = 2, ..., 10. the value of n
therefore ranges between 4 and 1024. a numerical prole of the domain wall was
obtained by simulation of the second order equation of motion for the eld x on a
discrete lattice, using a forward predicting algorithm. the lattice spacing was taken
much smaller than the width of the wall, and at the same time the size of the lattice
was chosen much larger than this width. the value of the eld was xed to take on
the two vacuum values at the two ends of the one dimensional lattice. a dissipation
term was added to the equation of motion so that the eld relaxes to the minimum
energy conguration. an interpolating prole between the two vacuum expectation
values was chosen as the initial condition. errors due to the nite lattice spacing
are well under control because the shape of the wall prole is smooth. errors due
to the nite size of the lattice are suppressed because the wall prole tends to the
vacuum expectation values exponentially fast. after the eld had come to rest, the
junction tension was then obtained from eq.(27) by numerical integration.

it may be worth a few words to motivate our choice of the second order equation
of motion over the rst order bps equation to obtain the numerical domain wall
prole. simulation of the equation of motion yields a domain wall prole even if the
wall is not bps saturated, but in the case of model i this does not oer an advantage,
as the walls are known to be bps saturated. however, numerical integration of the
rst order bps equation is fraught with an instability. this can best be seen from
an approximate solution of the bps equation near a vacuum value of the eld.
parametrizing the eld as x = n(ei/n + a + bi), the solution to the linearized bps
equation for a and b (valid for |a|,|b|  1) is

with the location of the center of the wall.
in simple numerical procedures to
integrate the bps equation, c2 will be small, but not equal to zero. as a result, the
numerical solution will show runaway behavior far away from the center of the wall.

to leading order contribution, and the dots represent the numerical calculation.

4 tjunction in model ii

although in general tjunction depends on the detailed shape of the domain walls
surrounding the junction, this is not the case for model ii. in fact, the tension of
the junction in model ii does not depend on a and b and can be calculated exactly
even though an analytic solution for the domain wall is not available for generic
ratios of a and b. the only assumption is that the elds m1 and m2 are real on
the domain wall prole. this is consistent with the explicit domain wall solution
for the special ratio of a and b discussed in appendix a, and it is conrmed by
numerical solutions of the domain wall prole for generic ratios. the eld t then
takes the form t = it + n cos /n on the domain wall, where t is a real function
with asymptotic values t() = n sin /n and t() = n sin /n. the junction
tension is now equal to

t2 = i dxkak = n z 



n cos /n

dt
dx

dx = n 3 sin 2/n.

(36)

the tension therefore only depends on the asymptotic values of the eld t on the
domain wall and is independent of the detailed shape of the wall. in this sense, the
junction tension tjunction in model ii is similar to the (1, 0) tension of domain walls.

5 reshuing between the (1, 0) and (1/2, 1/2) cen-
tral charges and the unique expression for t1,2

as was discussed at length in [10], in the case of wall junctions in supersymmetric
theories, one deals, in fact, with two central charges  one appears in the anticom-
mutator {qq} (this is the (1, 0) central charge), another appears in the anticom-
mutator {q q } (this is the (1/2, 1/2) central charge). the individual expressions
for these central charges are not unique. they depend on the expression for the
supercurrent one starts with. this is due to the fact that the eect under discussion
is subtle  we are interested in integrals over total derivatives. the supercurrent has
an ambiguity. say, in the wess-zumino model with one chiral supereld one can
add to the supercurrent the term

j  = 

2
3 h  (cid:16)(cid:17) +  (cid:16)(cid:17)  3

 (cid:16)(cid:17)i ,

(37)

which is conserved (nondynamically) and presents a full derivative. it has no impact
on the supercharges dened as

q = z d3xj 0

 ,

j 
 =

1
2

()

 j 

(38)

(for denitions see [5]). the contribution of j  in q is of the form r d3x~(...).

adding the term in eq. (37) one changes both central charges.

if we do not add the term j  in the supercurrent at all (by the way, this
will correspond to the canonic energy-momentum tensor), then we get eq.(9) with
s and a dened in eqs. (16) and (17). assume that we add to the supercurrent the
term j  as in eq. (37), with the coecient indicated in this expression. what
changes?

it is not dicult to show [5] that the changes are as follows: (ii) the energy-
momentum tensor appearing in the anticommutator of two supercharges acquires a
full-derivative (conserved) term built from the scalar elds; this term is such that

 now vanishes for purely cubic superpotential, i.e. for the conformally invariant
theory; (ii)  in eq. (16) now becomes
w


, s1,2 = {re , im};

 = w 

1
3



(39)

(iii) simultaneously, the expression h akdxk in eq.(9) changes too. let us keep, for

simplicity, the denition of the current (17) intact. then a new master equation
takes the form

where s is dened in eq.(39).

it is instructive to check that, in spite of the reshuing in the (1, 0) and (1/2, 1/2)
central charges, the nal results for the tensions t1,2 remain unambiguous. they are
insensitive to this reshuing. one can do this check explicitly using the analytic
solution for the bps wall which exist in model ii, see appendix. (a general proof
was presented in [10].) as previously, we split the contour integral in n sectors;
we will explicitly consider only the transition pq (fig.(1)). on the segments pd

and hq the extra term in the new master equation p w/ vanishes, since
these segments correspond to vacua, where w/ = 0. it is only the interval dh
that contributes to the integral over (2/3)p w/. one can readily convince
oneself that the contribution due to m1,2 appears only in im  s2, and, thus,
drops out. only the eld t is relevant. due to the fact that only the segments of
the type dh contribute, it is immediately clear that the above extra term in the
new master equation changes only the tension t2 leaving t1 intact.

now, at r   one can replace the dh segment by that for an isolated bps

wall, using explicit expressions collected in appendix a. in this way we get

using the same approach we readily nd that the term

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

this term was in the old master equation. in the new master equation we have one
third of it, i.e. the contribution to t2 coming from the axial current is one third of
that in eq. (44),

1(t2) = 

1

.

combining this with 2(t2) from eq. (42), we arrive at

t2 = 1(t2) + 2(t2) = n 3 sin

,

exactly the same result for tjunction that was obtained from the old master equation
where only the axial current contributed to it. the reshuing in the central charges
does take place; there is no impact on the physical quantities, however.

6 bps saturation of junctions in models i and ii

in this section we consider the question whether the domain wall junctions in models
i and ii saturate the bps bound. for certain limiting values of the parameters,
the bps equations for domain wall junctions in models i and ii allow an analytic
solution. this is the case for the n   limit in model i, as was shown in [10].
and in appendix b we present an analytic solution for the triple junction in model
ii, which can be obtained when n is a multiple of 3 and for a particular ratio of a
and b. this junction is a generalization of the analytic solution in [13]. for n = 3
the triple junction is also the basic junction. the above values of the parameters
seem only special because they allow an analytical solution, and not for any other
reason. moreover, for any value of the parameters there are sensible approximate
solutions to the bps equation far away from the center of the junction (domain
walls surrounding the center) and near the center (string-like solutions). all this
information strongly suggests that the junctions are bps saturated for all values of
the parameters.

in order to further test this hypothesis, we performed a numerical analysis. we
simulated the second order equations of motion for both models i and ii on a lattice
using a simple forward predicting algorithm. the procedure is a two-dimensional
generalization of the procedure described in sect.(3) to generate numerical domain
wall proles. the lattice spacing was chosen to be much smaller than the charac-
teristic size l of the junctions, and at the same time the size of the lattice was much
larger than l. we put the appropriate domain wall proles (numerically generated)
on the edges of the lattice as boundary conditions. a dissipation term was added to
the equations of motion, so that the eld conguration relaxes to the conguration
with lowest energy consistent with the boundary conditions.

we then determined whether the numerically obtained junction prole saturated
the bps bound by comparing the energy of the conguration to e(r) = t1r + t2.
for model i, t1 = 4n 4/(n + 1) sin /n, and t2 was determined numerically as in
sect.(3). for model ii, t1 = 4n 3b sin /n and t2 is given in eq.(36). numerical
errors due to the nite lattice spacing were well under control because the junction
shape is smooth, and errors due to the nite size of the lattice were suppressed
because the junction prole tends toward the domain wall solutions exponentially
fast away from its center.

we performed this procedure for model i with n = 4, and for model ii with
n = 4 and various values of the parameters a and b. in each case we found that the
junction was indeed bps saturated. this fact, in conjunction with the analytical
results, lends strong support to the conjecture that the basic junctions we have
discussed in models i and ii are bps saturated for all values of the parameters.

7 comments on stability of the bps wall junc-

tions

a general question which deserves a brief discussion is the stability (local and
global) of the bps wall junctions.
in this issue two features are crucial: (i) the
two-dimensional manifold perpendicular to the junction axis (the plane) is noncom-
pact, i.e. the junction spokes extend to innity; (ii) the wall junction is not a
two-dimensional soliton; rather, each spoke represents a wall which extends in the
direction perpendicular to the plane. this extension is innite.

as was discussed above, the mass of the bps wall junction can be expressed in
terms of two central charges which reduce, in turn, to the contour integral over the
large circle (see fig.(6.a), where we consider a z6 conguration, for deniteness).
this means that any localized perturbation of the junction conguration, both in
the plane (fig.6.b), and in the perpendicular direction, will lead to an encreased
energy, i.e. the bps wall junction is stable against such localized perturbations.

a global perturbation, when two spokes approach each other and then even-
tually fuse into one, is energetically favorable (figs. (6.c) and (6.d). this is due to
the fact that the isolated bps wall tension for the transition from the vacuum i to
the vacuum j has the form

tij = 2|wj  wi| = 2|wvac|  |e2ij/n  e2ii/n| ,

in the models under consideration, and, hence

tiii + tiiiii > tiiii .

(47)

(48)

in other words, eating up an intermediate vacuum we lower the energy of the con-
guration.

were the wall sizes nite, the conguration with six spokes in fig.(6.a) could
quantum-mechanically tunnel into the conguration with ve spokes (fig.(6.d), un-
der the barrier. however, since the walls are innite in both dimensions, this cannot
happen. the boundary conditions at innities make the bps wall junctions stable
both classically and quantum-mechanically. for further consideration see ref. [14].

8 conclusions

in supersymmetric models with the spontaneously broken zn symmetry we devel-
oped techniques for (i) establishing the bps nature of the wall junctions of the hub
and spokes type and for (ii) calculating the tensions t1 and tjunction. it is shown
that in natural models tjunction < 0. the conditions under which the unnatural
sign tjunction > 0 can occur are discussed.

readily found for a specic ratio of the coecients a and b, namely

(58)

the spoke in between the rst and the second vacuum points in the direction of the

this is an exact result, valid for any value of a and b, not just the special ratio
for which the analytic solution for the junction is obtained. for n = 3 this result
agrees with the tension presented in eq.(46) in the main text.
