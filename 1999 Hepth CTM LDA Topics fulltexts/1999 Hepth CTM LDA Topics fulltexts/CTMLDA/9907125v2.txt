abstract

by exploiting the properties of q-deformed coxeter elements, the
scattering matrices of ane toda eld theories with real coupling
constant related to any dual pair of simple lie algebras may be ex-
pressed in a completely generic way. we discuss the governing equa-
tions for the existence of bound states, i.e. the fusing rules, in terms
of q-deformed coxeter elements, twisted q-deformed coxeter elements
and undeformed coxeter elements. we establish the precise relation
between these dierent formulations and study their solutions. the
generalized s-matrix bootstrap equations are shown to be equivalent
to the fusing rules. the relation between dierent versions of fusing
rules and quantum conserved quantities, which result as nullvectors of
a doubly q-deformed cartan like matrix, is presented. the properties
of this matrix together with the so-called combined bootstrap equa-
tions are utilised in order to derive generic integral representations for
the scattering matrix in terms of quantities of either of the two dual
algebras. we present extensive case-by-case data, in particular on the
orbits generated by the various coxeter elements.

1 introduction

the perturbation of 1+1 dimensional conformal eld theories [1] in a suitable
way leads to massive quantum eld theories which possess a rich underlying
structure. soon after the seminal paper by zamolodchikov [3] a decade ago
on the perturbation of the ising model, it was realized [4] that most of these
massive theories are closely related to ane toda eld theories [5], either in
a minimal sense or with the coupling constant included. on the base of
case-by-case studies for various algebras several explicit scattering matrices
were constructed thereafter [6]. for the simply laced algebras (ade) this se-
ries of investigations culminated with the formulation of universal formulae
which encompass all these algebras at once [7, 8]. the universal nature of
these representations for the scattering matrices allowed also to establish the
equivalence between the bootstrap equations and a classical fusing rule [7] for-
mulated with the orbits generated by coxeter elements of the related algebra
[9]. furthermore the fusing rule is closely linked to the quantum conservation
laws. the origin for the structural interrelation between the classical and the
quantum eld theory is the fact that for the simply laced theories all masses
of the theory renormalise with an overall factor [6]. it is the breakdown of
this property for theories related to a non-simply laced algebra which consti-
tuted the main obstacle in the construction of consistent scattering matrices
on the base of the boostrap principle. once again numerous candidates were
proposed on the base of case-by-case studies [10, 11, 12, 13], but it remained
a challenge to nd a closed universal representation similar to the simply
laced case for these theories, until oota recently [14] succeeded.

the main conceptual breakthrough towards this goal was the proposal by
dorey [4], that one may regard these theories in a dual sense, mathematically
in a lie algebraic way and physically equivalent to this in the strong-weak
duality sense in the coupling constant and the generalization of the boot-
strap principle [11] by corrigan, dorey and sasaki. from this point of view
ane toda theories constitute some concrete simple examples for the olive-
montonen duality [16]. technically it was also very important to express the
scattering matrices in the adequate building blocks [12]. chari and pressley
[17] succeeded thereafter to work out in detail the suggested [4] fusing rules in

there exist earlier considerations of eld theories in 1+1 dimensions which focus on
the aspect of conformal invariance, e.g. [2]. however, the key feature, i.e. the role played
by the virasoro algebra, which lead to a more universal formulation and allowed to nd
their solution was rst realised and exploited in [1].

1

terms of the two dual algebras which reproduced precisely the allowed fusing
processes. oota [14] suggested to re-formulate these fusing rules in terms of
q-deformed coxeter transformations of either of the two dual lie algebras.
viewing matters in the latter fashion allows to link the fusing rules to the
scattering matrices and nd closed universal representations.

one of the purposes of this paper is to precisely establish and derive the
interrelation between the dierent versions of the fusing rules. we further
demonstrate that these fusing rules are equivalent to the s-matrix bootstrap
equations. numerous identities which were hitherto only claimed on the base
of case-by-case analysis are rigorously derived. we manifest the relation be-
tween quantum conserved quantities and the various versions of the fusing
rules. we derive a set of equations, which we refer to as combined boot-
strap equations, and exploit them systematically to derive generic integral
representations for the scattering matrix.

our manuscript is organized as follows: we rst develop the mathematics
needed and apply it thereafter in the physical context. in section 2 we dene
two dierent q-deformed coxeter elements related to two lie algebras dual
to each other. we derive some of their properties which we need later on in
the physical context. in particular their action in the root space and inner
product relations. in section 3 we formulate several equivalent versions of
the fusing rule, study their dierent solutions and establish their relation to
quantum conserved quantities. in section 4 we apply our results to a univer-
sal formula for the scattering matrices of ane toda eld theories in terms of
basic building blocks consisting of specic combinations of hyperbolic func-
tions, whose powers may be obtained from q-deformed quantities of either
of the two dual algebras. an alternative formula for the scattering matrix
in form of an integral representation is derived in section 5. we exploit the
properties of matrices m and n related to the untwisted and twisted alge-
bra, respectively, and establish their equality.
in section 6 we reduce the
expressions for the scattering matrix to the simply laced case.
in section
7 we provide a case-by-case analysis for all non-simply laced algebras. our
conclusions are stated in section 8.

2 q-deformed coxeter elements of dual pairs

adopting the standard notation of [18], we let x (1)
n be a simple simply laced
lie algebra of rank n endowed with a dynkin diagram automorphism  of

2

order l. employing this automorphism to x a subalgebra in x (1)
n we obtain
the twisted lie algebra x (l)
n of rank r. changing the orientation of the
arrows of the dynkin diagram related to this twisted lie algebra x (l)
n , that
is interchanging long and short roots, produces a dynkin diagram related
to a lie algebra x (1)
. two lie algebras which are related by this map are
referred to as dual pair (x (1)
n ). simply laced lie algebras are self-dual
in this sense.

, x (l)

r

r

before we move on to the q-deformed case we shall collect a few well
known facts in order to dene our notations. to each simple root i of x (1)
or i of x (l)
n a reection on the hyperplane through the origin orthogonal to
i or i may be associated

r

i(x) = x  2

x  i

i

i

or

i(x) = x  2

x  i

i

i .

(1)

note that there is no sum over i implied here on the r.h.s. these are the
weyl reections constituting the weyl group which are used to construct the
so-called coxeter- and twisted coxeter element

 =

i

ryi=1

and

 =

i

ryi=1

(2)

and x (l)

r

for x (1)
n , respectively. the latter denition is originally due to
springer [19]. we also note here that these elements are not unique and only
dened up to conjugation. there are several coxeter numbers (see e.g. [18]),
whose intimate relations we wish to exploit. expressing the highest root of
x (1)
i=1 nii, the corresponding coxeter- and the dual coxeter
numbers are dened as

as  = pr

r

h = 1 +

rxi=1

ni

and

h = 1 +

n
i

.

rxi=1

(3)

i =
i /2. since dual algebras are obtained from each other by the interchange

the so-called marks ni (or kac labels) and co-marks n
ni2
of roots and co-roots, i.e. i  2i/2
and

i , one deduces easily that

i are related by n

h = h ,

h = h

(4)

where h,h are the coxeter numbers of x (l)
ments read

n . the order of the coxeter ele-

h = 1

and

h = 1

q

i (j) := j (cid:16)2ij  [iji]q(cid:17) i .

(6)

where h is the l-th coxeter number of x (l)

n , i.e. h = lh.

following now essentially oota [14] the denitions of the coxeter elements

(2) can be generalized by introducing a q-deformation.

2.1 q-deformed coxeter element of x (1)

r

2.1.1 denitions

using the standard notation [n]q = (qn  qn)/(q1  q1) for q-deformed
integers, we dene the action of the q-deformed weyl reection q
i on a
simple root i as

r

. we easily verify the usual properties of a reection (q

here i denotes the incidence matrix, i.e. twice the unit matrix minus the
cartan matrix kij = 2i  j/2
j , related to the simply laced lie algebra
x (1)
i )2 = 1. for
the time being we assume the deformation parameter q to be completely
generic, that is some complex number which is not a root of unity. in some
later applications we will specify q to be a root of unity and also introduce
a particular parameterization q(), where  is a coupling constant. in that
situation the classical limit q  1 corresponds to the vanishing of the
coupling constant.
since in general weyl reections do not commute, coxeter elements, i.e.
the products of all weyl reections related to simple roots, only form a
conjugacy class. however, by introducing a particular ordering amongst the
simple roots, one is able to dene the coxeter element uniquely. for this
purpose we partition the set of simple roots, denoted by , into two disjoint
sets of roots, say , by associating the values ci = 1 to the vertices i of
the dynkin diagram of x (1)
, in such a way that no two vertices related to the
same set are linked together. then it clearly holds by (6) that two reections
related to simple roots belonging to the same colour set commute,

r

hq

i , q

ji = 0

consequently the two special elements

for

ci = cj .

q

 := yi

q
i ,

(7)

(8)

are uniquely dened, having obviously the property (q
)2 = 1. for reasons
which become more apparent below, it is convenient to introduce the simple

4

root times its colour value as a separate quantity i := cii. then, the action
of the reections on these elements is easily worked out. with the help of
(6), (7) and (8) we obtain

q
ci(i) = i

and q

ci(i) = i  xj ci

[iij]q j .

(9)

here we introduced the notation q
+ or
q
 when ci = 1 or ci = 1, respectively. denoting now by s  s and
l  l the short and the long roots, respectively, we dene some integers

ci, meaning that it takes the values q

ti =( 1

2
l /2
s

for i  s
for i  l

(10)

(11)

which symmetrize the incidence matrix

iijtj = ijiti .

l /2

the ratio 2
s is indeed an integer, which follows directly from the deni-
tion of the cartan matrix. in fact it equals l (1, 2 or 3), the highest order of
the dynkin diagram automorphism of the algebra x (1)
n . the occurrence of
quantities of x (1)
, is a feature
we will encounter more frequently in the course of our discussion and indi-
cates the close interrelation between the two dual algebras. we employ the
symmetrizers (10) to introduce the map

n , despite the fact that we are discussing x (1)

r

 (i) := qtii .

(12)

we have now assembled all the ingredients in order to dene the q-deformed
coxeter element

q := q

  q

+  .

(13)

having eliminated the ambiguity in the ordering of the q-deformed weyl
reections within q
, the only matter left to convention with regard to the
q-deformed coxeter element is the ordering of the four maps in (13) and the
two possible choices for the colour values we attribute to the vertices of the
dynkin diagram. the former ambiguity is xed by the choice in (13) and the
latter by choosing the unique vertex of the short root which is connected to a
long root as ci = 1. note also that limq1 q = , that is in the classical
limit we recover the usual coxeter element (2) from the q-deformed coxeter
element (13).

2.1.2 action of q in the root space

there are several properties of the q-deformed coxeter element which we
wish to exploit in the context of the scattering matrix of ane toda eld
theories. first we state the identities

(14)

(15)

,

which follow immediately by noting that under the interchange of q and
q1 the elements q
in fact the r.h.s. of
these equations correspond to several equations which are combined to one
by including the colour values ci and cj in the way we need them. obviously,
(q)1 =  1q

 remain invariant and    1.

 is the inverse q-deformed coxeter element.

+  1q

we further need to know the action of q on the simple roots. from (9),

(12) and (13) we obtain

q(i) + q2tii =xjci

q

3+ci

2 ti+

1+cj

2

tj [iij]q j +

ci  1
2 xj +

l

qti+tj [iij]q [ijl]q l

and also the crucial identity

(cid:16)qciti(q)ci + qciti(cid:17) (i) = xj ci

1+ci

2 ti

1+cj

2

q

tj [iij]q j .

(16)

(17)

acting now successively with q on i and the multiplication with powers of
q will create an orbit which we denote by q
for x, y being arbitrary
integers a typical element in q
i reads qxy
q (i). the periodicity of these
orbits reads

i , i.e.

q2h (q)h = 1 .

(18)

we do not have a general proof of (18), but it is conrmed on the base of a
case-by-case analysis in section 7 as may be seen from the data presented. to
each orbit q
i we associate a particle species. the anti-particle is identied
with the orbit in which we nd the element

cci

2

2 + cic
h
q

4

ti 

 qh+

i =   q
 .

we dier here from the denition of the inverse in [14].

(19)

6

the property cic = (1)h [8] ensures that the power of the coxeter element
is always an integer. conjugating  once more in (19) leads to (18), when
ti = t. for the non-simply laced algebras, the relation (19) reduces to



h
2

q i = qh  ,

(20)

since in that case all particles are self-conjugate. the motivation of this
denition is analogue to the one known from the simply laced case [9]. this
means complex conjugating the eld which creates the particle of type i in the
classical theory corresponds to the creation of the anti-particle , suggesting
to associate i to the anti-particle. however, one should keep in mind
that in this context the classical theory is only known in the extreme weak
or extreme strong limit of the coupling constant. in the classical limit we
recover the known identity [8] for the simply laced case 
4 i = 
which relates particles and anti-particles.

h

cic

inner product identities

2.1.3
we introduce now the co-fundamental weights i, related to the fundamental
weights i as i := 2i/2
i , such that they constitute a dual base to the
simple roots, i.e. i  j = ij. in comparison to the non-deformed (simply
laced) case, it is important to note that q does in general not preserve the
inner product, i.e. j  (q)xi 6= (q)xj  i.
weights we can write

in view of (9), (12) and the orthogonality of roots and co-fundamental

j  x

q i = j  q

cj x

q i = qtj j   x

q i .

using now (9), (15) and exploiting (21) we derive

j  x

q i = j

(24)

7

as the last inner product identity we show

(q2tj  1)( j  (q)xi) = (q2ti  1)( i  (q)xj) .

(25)

we prove (25) by induction and demonstrate therefore rst that it holds for
x = 1. with the help of (16) we obtain

(q2tj  1)q(i)  j = (q2tj  1)

qti+tp [iip]q [ipj]q

tj [iij]q ci,cj(cid:19) .

(26)

noting that (11) also holds for the q-deformed quantities, i.e.
[iij]q[tj]q =
[iji]q[ti]q, it is easy to verify that the r.h.s. of equation (26) is symmetric in
i and j. assuming now relation (25) to be valid for x, one deduces by the
similar reasoning as for the case x = 1, that (25) also holds for x + 1 and
therefore for all integers x. this establishes (25).

it should be mentioned that once we have the matrix representation of

section 5.1 the symmetry property (25) follows more easily.

2.2 q-deformed twisted coxeter element of x (l)
n

2.2.1 denitions

let us now consider a lie algebra x (1)
n , whose associated dynkin diagram
is endowed with an automorphism  which acts on a simple root i with
length li, i.e. lii = i. the largest value of li corresponds to l. sometimes
we will also use the common notation i = (i). we may employ this
automorphism to dene the orbits 
i by successive actions of  on a simple
root i. by selecting a representative of the orbit 
i , we can build up a set
of roots, which we denote by i  . the algebra related to these roots is
the twisted lie algebra x (l)
n . to each of the r elements in  we associate a
particular particle species. we choose the conventions in such a way that we
may carry out a one-to-one correspondence between the two dual algebras
without renaming the particles, see section 7. the weyl reections related
to these representatives are now dened in the usual fashion as in (1)

i(j) = j  kjii ,

(27)

8

where k denotes the cartan matrix of x (1)
n . analogously to the non-twisted
case, treated in the previous section, we can bi-colour the dynkin diagram
and divide the set of representatives into two sets  and
related to x (1)
n
+. note that roots related by the automorphism  possess naturally the
same colour value. hence we may dene uniquely the elements

 := yi 

i .

(28)

besides the absence of the q-deformation, the dierence between these special
elements of the weyl group in comparison with the non-twisted case is that
the product runs only over the representatives. we dene now the integers

ti =( 1

0

for i  
for i / 

.

(29)

with the help of (27) we easily compute the action of  on some i := cii,
where we stress that i is not necessarily a representative

cii = (1)tii

and

cii = i  xj  ci

iij j

.

(30)

the incidence matrix i is here related to x (1)
and 1  j  r.
q-deformation

n , but note that 1  i  n
in addition we introduce the map which will serve as a

 (i) := q2tii .

(31)

at last we are in the position to dene, analogously to [14], the q-deformed
twisted coxeter element as

q := 1   + .

(32)

once again by means of the bi-colouration, we have achieved that q is
uniquely dened up to the ordering of the maps occurring in (32). for q  1
we obtain one of the standard twisted coxeter elements in the conjugacy
class as originally introduced by springer (2). we will not elaborate here on
the alternative characterization of the twisted coxeter element, which may
be obtained from the folding of an ane simply laced dynkin diagram, see
e.g. [18, 24, 25].

2.2.2 action of q in the root space

(34)

acting successively with q and q on the elements of , we construct the
orbits of the q-deformed twisted coxeter element, which we denote by q
i .
the order of the q-deformed twisted coxeter element reads

q2hh

q = 1 .

(35)

thus in comparison with (18) the roles of h and h are just interchanged.
like in the non-twisted case we do not have a generic proof of this periodicity
property, but we have veried it case-by-case in section 7.

the anti-particle is identied with the orbit in which we nd the element

simply laced algebras, the relation (19) reduces to

h
2

q +



(37)
since in that case all particles are self-conjugate. in the limit q  1 we obtain

to prove these identities directly is much more involved as for the equivalent
relations in the untwisted case. we will therefore postpone the proof until
section 5.2. where we can exploit properties of a dierent quantity which
then implies the validity of (40) and (41).

3 the fusing rules

r

we are now in the position to formulate the universal fusing rules. this may
be done either by exploiting the properties of the orbits of the q-deformed
or the q-deformed twisted coxeter element of x (l)
coxeter element of x (1)
n
similar to the approach of oota [14] or alternatively in the spirit of chari
and pressley [17] one may consider the orbits of the non-deformed coxeter
element of x (1)
r and simultaneously the non-deformed twisted coxeter ele-
ment of x (l)
n . additionally one may formulate the fusing rule in terms of the
quantum conserved quantities. we will discuss the solutions to these dier-
ent fusing rules and prove in general that they are in fact all equivalent. we
derive the precise quantitative relation between the relevant quantities.

3.1 the fusing rule in q

the generalized three-point-coupling related to three particles of the type i, j
and k is non-vanishing, i.e. the process i + j  k is possible, if and only
usually we really refer to the three-point-coupling in the common sense, i.e. related
to the process i + j  k. the only exceptions are the processes 2 + 2  2 and 3 + 3  3
in (f (1)
6 ), which are possible from the fusing rule point of view. however, on the
s-matrix bootstrap side these processes correspond to third order poles.

this means there should exist two triplets of integers (i, j, k) and

( i,  j,  k) such that

xl=i,j,k

ql l

q l = 0 .

(42)

multiplying (42) by qn or m
q corresponds naturally to the same process and
we should therefore view the triplets as equivalence classes. in this sense
we regard two pairs of triplets as equivalent if they may be constructed from
each other by the displacements  l   l + m or l  l + n. similarly as
in the simply laced case [8], it will turn out to be crucial that there exists a
second solution to (42)

(43)

q 

l 

l

q l = 0 .

the two solutions may not be obtained from each other by simple shifts, but
they are related as


l = l +

cl  1

2

and  

l =  l  (1 + cl)tl ,

l = i, j, k.

(44)

nonetheless, as an existence criterion for the fusing process, the variant (42)
is sucient, since the second solution may always be constructed from the
rst as we now demonstrate. changing q to q1 in the fusing rule (42) and
using (14) thereafter, we obtain

(45)

xl=i,j,k

acting on this equation with  1q
+ 1 yields (43), with the help of (9), (12)
and (13). what remains to be shown is that these two solutions are indeed
non-equivalent in the sense dened above. for this purpose we may take the
limit q  1 and note that the quantities l and 
l are related to each other
in the same way as in the simply laced case. we may now simply refer to
[8] for the proof of the non-equivalence of this two triplets. this is sucient
to establish the non-equivalence between the two solutions. in addition we
shall demonstrate below that there exists in fact no further non-equivalent
solution.

we shall see below that from a physical point of view this corresponds to a simple

shift in the bootstrap functional equations which involve the scattering matrix.

3.2 the fusing rule in q

the generalized three-point-coupling related to three particles of the type i, j
and k is non-vanishing, i.e. the process i + j  k is possible, if and only
if there exist representatives of the q-deformed orbits

( i,  j,  k) such that

l 

q

l +

l = 0 .

xl=i,j,k

(46)

equivalence of two solutions is dened as in the previous section, i.e. two
triplets which are obtained by simple shifts of the type l  l + m and  l
  l+n are considered equivalent to the original solution. however, as in the
non-twisted case, also (46) always admits a second non-equivalent solution

q



l 



q +
l

l = 0 .

(47)

the relations between the two solutions read

and 





l =  l + 1  cl

l = l +

2

ll + 1 + cl ,

l = i, j, k.

(48)

as in the previous section the second solution may be constructed from the
rst, and therefore the variant (46) is sucient as an existence criterion.

3.3 the fusing rule in  and 

the generalized three-point-coupling related to three particles of the type i, j
and k is non-vanishing, i.e. the process i + j  k is possible, if and only if
there exist representatives of the orbits i, j and k whose sum is zero and
cj 1
2 j and
if in addition there exist representatives of the orbits 


ck 1
2 k which also sum up to zero.
quantitatively this means there should exist two triplets of integers (i, j, k)

ci1
2 i, 

and (i, j, k) such that

xl=i,j,k

l l = 0

and

xl=i,j,k

l +

l = 0 .



(49)

13

the version (49) of the fusing rule was rst stated by chari and pressley [17],
with the only dierence that our  corresponds to the inverse twisted coxeter
element in [17] and also +
is dened dierently in their formulation. the
l
multiplication of the rst equation in (49) by powers of the coxeter element
 and the second by powers of the twisted coxeter element  will produce
further solutions, which we regard as equivalent. once again there exists a
second non-equivalent solution

xl=i,j,k



l l = 0

and

xl=i,j,k






l +

l = 0 ,

(50)

which is related to the rst by the relevant relations in (44) and (48). the
equations (49) and (50) may be obtained in the limit q  1 from (42),
(43) and (46), (47), respectively. since we have already shown that nei-
ther the triplet (
k) may be obtained from (i, j, k) by simple shifts
nor (
k) from (i, j, k) by the same means, we have established the
nonequivalence between the two solutions. it is also clear from the preceding
sections that we may construct the second solution always from the rst.

3.4 the fusing rule and conserved quantities
let y(n) (1  n  r) be a vector whose components are labeled by particle
types. in particular for n = 1 we identify yi(1) with the quantum mass mi
of the particle of species i. then we may formulate a further variant of the
fusing rule:

the generalized three-point-coupling related to three particles of the type

i, j and k is non-vanishing, i.e. the process i + j  k is possible, if there
exist two triplets of integers (i, j, k) and (i, j, k) such that

esn(lh+lh ) yl(n) = 0 .

(51)

xl=i,j,k

the sn (1  n  r) label the exponents of the algebra x (1)
order. we further introduced the angles

r

in increasing

h :=

i(2  b)

2h

and

h :=

ib
2h

,

(52)

in fact we see below that this will be the nullvector of a particular matrix as specied

in equation (100).

14

whose deeper origin becomes more apparent when we discuss the scattering
matrix in section 4. the coupling constant  enters here the expressions
through the function b = 2h2/(h2 + 4h) which takes values between 0
and 2. obviously, multiplying equation (51) by emsnlh and eksnlh , with
m, k being arbitrary integers, will also produce a solution, which we regard
as equivalent in the same spirit as in the previous subsections. likewise there
exists a second non-equivalent solution

esn(

lh+

lh ) yl(n) = 0

,

(53)

xl=i,j,k

related to the rst simply as


l = l

and


l = l .

(54)

clearly we can not construct (51) from (53) by multiplication of esnmlh and
esnklh unless i = j = k and i = j = k. the latter fact would mean

that pl=i,j,k yl(n) = 0, which in particular for n = 1 is impossible since all
quantities in the sum, the masses, are positive. we have therefore established
that the two solutions are indeed non-equivalent. however, one solution may
always be constructed from the other simply by replacing sn  sn or
complex conjugation of (51) or (53).

15

having obtained the fusing angles  we may immediately compute rela-
tions among the quantum conserved quantities. combining (51) and (53) we
derive

yi(n)
yj(n)

=

sinh(cid:16)sn(k  j)h + sn(k  j)h(cid:17)
sinh (sn(i  k)h + sn(i  k)h)

.

(55)

we may interpret these relations in the complex velocity plane as explained
in [8]. in particular for s1 = 1 we obtain the important ratios of the quantum
masses

mi
mj

=

sinh(cid:16)(k  j)h + (k  j)h(cid:17)
sinh ((i  k)h + (i  k)h)

.

(56)

as the main dierence to the simply laced case we note that the masses
now depend on the coupling constant. the relevant triangles are depicted in
gure 1. we will now be more specic on how to calculate the fusing angles
from lie algebraic properties.

3.5 relations between the fusing rules

the four versions of the fusing rules are all related to each other, meaning
that having one solution of one particular formulation of the fusing rule we
are able to construct all the other solutions. the precise relations read

l = 

l  l =

 l  
2


l

and l =

 l   

l

2


= 

l  l

for l = i, j, k.

(57)
we see that the interchange of the two solutions of one version of the fusing
rule immediately demands that the two solutions of the other rules should
also be exchanged. in particular it follows that

1  cl

2

1 + cl

ll 

 l = 2l +

 2l =  l,
these relations do not only relate the fusing rule in q and q to each
other, but they also provide the precise link between the q-deformed and
non-deformed versions of the fusing rule. it will take until subsection 5.1. to
have assembled all the ingredients for the proof of (57).

for l = i, j, k. (58)

tl + 1 + cl

2

there is one last question which we should answer with regard to possible
solutions of the fusing rules: are there any further non-equivalent solutions
to these equations? the answer is no. for the proof of this statement we

16

assume at this point that the rules are indeed equivalent, such that it suces
to discuss only one version. we adopt the argumentation of [8] for this
purpose. the only four triangles which we may construct in the complex
velocity plane from three sides with xed modulus are the ones depicted in
gure 1. hence there are no further possible angles, meaning no additional
non-equivalent solution to (51) exist. by (57) this fact is also established for
all other versions of the fusing rule we have stated.

treating the fusing rule as a pure existence criterion for the possibility
of certain fusing processes, one version is as good as the other. we observed
however that the relevant data from the classical fusing rules, which cor-
respond to two equations in section 3.3., may be merged together into one
single equation by the q-deformation. this is the key feature which can be
exploited in the quantum eld theory and which appears to be absolutely
necessary for the construction of generic expressions for the scattering ma-
trices.

4 block representation

the scattering matrices for ane toda eld theories have been the subject
of numerous investigations [6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14]. restricting the attention
to the case when the coupling constant is real, the two-particle scattering
matrix for all simple lie algebras, involving particles of the species i and j as
a function of the relative rapidity , may be cast into the universal expression

sij() =

hyx=1

hyy=1{x, y}

2ij (x,y)


.

(59)

here {x, y} are certain combinations of hyperbolic functions and the ij(x, y)
are positive semi-integers for the given range in (59).

4.1 the building blocks

before explaining how the powers ij(x, y) may be computed, we present sev-
eral representations of the general building blocks, which will serve dierent
purposes. as a crucial step in the process of formulating generic expressions
for scattering matrices one should view the observation of p. dorey [12] who
noticed that the building blocks may all be expressed in a very elegant form.

17

we slightly modify them to simplify certain computations and denek

{x, y} :=

[x, y]
[x, y]

(60)

and

[x, y] := hx  1, y  1i hx + 1, y + 1i
hx  1, y + 1i hx + 1, y  1i

hx, yi := sinh

1
2

( + xh + yh ) .

(61)
we used the angles h and h as introduced in section 3.4. notice that the
strong-weak duality transformation   4/ (b  2  b), h  h leaves
the scattering matrix invariant. one should stress that besides the strong-
weak interchange the invariance also demands the interchange of the coxeter
numbers.

alternatively, each block (60) admits an integral representation in the

form

with

{x, y} = exp

z0

dt

t sinh t

i!
x,y (t) sinh  t

f h,h

f h,h
x,y (t) = 8 sinh (ht) sinh (ht) sinh (t  xht  yht) .

(62)

(63)

this may be veried for instance by the explicit computation of the integral
in (62). we abbreviated here h := (2 b)/2h and h := b/2h. particular
attention has to be paid to the convergence of the integral representation
(62), especially when we analytically continue. shifting    + xh + yh,
convergence requires that

0  (x  x  1)h + (y  y  1)h  2(1  (1 + x)h  (1 + y)h) . (64)
in particular for real rapidity  the convergence is guaranteed if 0 < x < h
and 0 < y < h.

with regard to several applications, the values of the scattering matrices
at  = 0 are of special interest and we therefore comment on it for denite-
ness. in general we have {x, y}=0 = 1, apart from the case {1, 1}=0 = 1.
kin [11, 22] a dierent type of blocks was used. they may be translated into each other

by simple replacements, e.g. for g2 and f4 one sets h 1 = h + h .

18

this means we have to pay attention to the ordering of certain limits. when
writing the blocks in form of hyperbolic functions (60), we have to set rst
x = y = 1 and then take the limit   0, whereas in the integral representa-
tion (62) we have to set x = y = 1, integrate thereafter and nally take the
limit   0.
of our argumentation

the following obvious identities will turn out to be useful in the course

{x, y} = {x + 2h, y + 2h} = {x,y}1



=

[x + x, y + y]
[x  x, y  y]

{x, y}+xh+yh
{x, y}+ph+qh {x, y}phqh

= {x + p, y + q} {x  p, y  q} .

(65)

(66)

(67)

furthermore, it will be convenient to adopt the slightly more compact nota-
tion for the product of several blocks
 . . .{xn, yn}n

2 ;   ; xn, yn
n }

 =: {x1, y1

{x1, y1}1

 {x2, y2}2

1 ; x2, y2

(68)

from time to time.

we shall now come to the characterization of the powers ij(x, y) of par-
ticular blocks {x, y}, which may be computed either by using the properties
of x (1)

or x (l)
n .

for xed x. taking x in the range (3  ci)/2  x  h + (1  ci)/2 ensures
that the rst argument of  is between 1 and 2h. this formula is a natural
generalization of the one for the simply laced case (128), where now the
q-deformation incorporates the information of both dual algebras. at this
point we have only stated (69) and we shall now convince ourselves that it
is indeed satisfying all the requirements we need.

when applying formula (59), we have to guarantee that the properties of
the combinations of hyperbolic functions in the building blocks {x, y} are

19

reected in the correct way by the lie algebraic quantities. this means, that
according to the identities in (65) we should have
ij(x, y) = ij(x+2h, y+2h) and ij(x, y) = ij(2hx, 2hy) . (70)
considering (69), the rst relation in (70) follows trivially from (18). to-
gether with the r.h.s. of (69) the second relation in (70) may be proven
directly with the help of (24). the second relation is important, since it
ensures that we can always nd two blocks which combine in such a way
that the total power of each building block becomes an integer. therefore it
guarantees that the scattering matrix is a meromorphic function, even if we
choose (this is sometimes very convenient) the ranges in (59) to be 1  x  h
and 1  y  h.
having established the formal legitimacy of (59), it is clear that properties
of the s may be carried over into properties of the scattering matrix. we
will therefore prove several identities which we exploit below when discussing
the scattering matrix.
first we note that

ij(x, y) = ji(x, y) = j(x + h, y + h) .

(71)

the symmetry in the subscripts follows directly from the dening relation
for the s (69) and the symmetry property of the inner product (25). the
second equation follows in view of the denition of the anti-particle (19) and
(69). the latter identity relates the powers involving the particle on one
hand and the anti-particle on the other and will therefore turn out to be
useful to show the crossing relation.

from the fusing rule in q follows by similar manipulations as we have

just performed

xl=i,j,k

lp (x  l, y  l) = 0 ,

(72)

where the lower sign relates to the rst (42) and the upper sign to the second
solution (43). the integers l and l are related to the two solutions of the
fusing rules by (57).
it still needs to be established that they are indeed
the same as the ones occurring in the equations involving the conserved
quantities, (51) and (53). it will turn out that both relations in (72) will be
crucial to prove the bootstrap equations for the scattering matrices.

the nal relation in this section follows from (17) and (69)

ij(x + 1, y + ti) + ij(x  1, y  ti) =

iilxn=1xl

lj(x, y + 2n  1  iil) , (73)

20

where we understand that the sum piil

n=1 yields zero when iil = 0. we can
view (73) as a particular solution of the recursive equations (2.4) quoted
in [14]. one may take these equations as a starting point and use them
to construct the powers ij recursively. however, it remains unclear how to
obtain the equations (73) from rst principles. in fact (73) should be regarded
as a consequence of (72) and we therefore view the latter equations as more
fundamental. we demonstrate this fact only for the equivalent equations of
the scattering matrices, since in that setting they correspond to a simple
physical property, see section 7.

4.3 the powers from x (l)
n
alternatively we can use the data of the twisted algebra x (l)
in order to
n
compute the powers of the building blocks.
in this case the role of two
arguments x and y in the generating function is reversed, that is now we
x a particular y and read o the possible values for x from the generating
functions

or in terms of
since the two descriptions, i.e.
the data of x (l)
n are supposed to be the same, we expect similar relations as
we obtained in the previous section for the s also to hold for the s. now
property (65) of the blocks demands that

ij(x, y) =  ij(x+2h, y +2h) and ij(x, y) =  ij(2hx, 2hy) . (75)
the rst relation in (75) follows trivially from (35). once again we may
guarantee that the scattering matrix is a meromorphic function by means
of the second relation in (75), which follows from (41). we also have the
identities which imply parity and crossing

 ij(x, y) =  ji(x, y) = j(x + h, y + h) .

(76)

the rst equation follows now from (40) and the second from (36). the
relation which implies the bootstrap identity

we should keep in mind here that we did not yet prove (41) and (40). in fact we
reverse the logic and prove rst the properties for the s in section 5.2. and deduce from
them the inner product identities in section 2.2.3.

21

xl=i,j,k

lp (x  l, y  l) = 0 ,

(77)

follows from the version of the fusing rules related to the q-deformed twisted
coxeter element in q (section 3.2). as the counterpart of (73) we derive
from the dening relations of the s and (34)

4.4 bootstrap properties

the exact expressions for two-particle scattering matrices of integrable quan-
tum eld theories may be obtained by solving certain consistency equations,
the so-called bootstrap equations. we will now demonstrate that (59) ful-
lls indeed all the requirements and take this as a proof for the conjectured
formulae stated in the previous subsection.

4.4.1 unitarity, crossing and parity invariance

the unitarity-analyticity equation sij()sij() = 1 follows trivially from
the property {x, y} {x, y} = 1 of each individual building blocks. the
crossing relation sij() = sj(i  ) requires in general a little bit more
eort, e.g. [25]. using (65) and (66) we obtain

sij(i) = sij(hh+hh) =

hyx=1

hyy=1{x + h, y + h}

ij (x+h,y+h)


. (79)

employing now the second identity in (71), the r.h.s. of (79) equals sj(),
which establishes the crossing relation. the parity invariance of the scatter-
ing matrix, i.e. sij() = sji(), is guaranteed by the symmetry property of
the s in the lower indices, i.e. the rst equation in (71).

alternatively we can use the data of the q-deformed twisted coxeter
element and repeat the argumentation once more, using now the relations
(76) instead of (71).

22

4.4.2 bootstrap identities

we will now come to the key equations, whose names are sometimes associ-
ated with this whole approach, the bootstrap equations. the claim is that
once the fusing rules in section 3 hold, the following identity is true for the
scattering matrices

yl=i,j,k

spl( + lh + lh) = 1 .

(80)

the integers l and l may be expressed by using the data from the vari-
ous versions of the fusing rules (57). the proofs of the relations (80) are
straightforward. we obtain with the help of (66)

yx,y

l=i,j,k

{x, y}

pl(x,y)

+lh+lh = yx,y

l=i,j,k

pl(x,y)
[x + l, y + l]

pl(x,y)
[x  l, y  l]


= 1 .

(81)

the last step follows by shifting x  x l and x  x + l in the numerator
and denominator, respectively, such that we can employ the two equations in
(72). we note that it is crucial to have both solutions at hand. alternatively
we can derive the bootstrap equation (80) by exploiting the property (77) of
the s and repeating the arguments once more.

with the help of (67) we translate (73) into what we refer to as the

combined bootstrap identity for the scattering matrix

iilyn=1

sjl ( + (2n  1  iil)h)

.

ryl=1
sij ( + h + tih) sij (  h  tih) =
here we understand that the productqiil

(82)
n=1 contributes 1 when iil = 0. some-
times this identity is identical to some bootstrap equation, but in general it
has to be constructed by combining several identities of the type (80) in a
very particular way. its signicance is, that it may be employed in order to
derive the matrix representation for the scattering matrix (see section 4.3).
[iil]q  iil, h  h, ti  1, we
reducing (82) to the simply laced case, i.e.
recover an identity quoted in [23], see section 7.

4.4.3 occurrence of certain special blocks

for various purposes it is important to exhibit explicitly the occurrence of
particular blocks {x, y} in the general formula (59). it is possible to extract

23

the blocks of the form {1, y} {2, y} from the general product and re-write
the scattering matrix as

sij() = {1, 1ti}ij

 n2, 2iij tjo yx6=1,2yy {x, y}

.

(83)

for the proof of (83) we exploit the properties of the q-deformed coxeter
element q. considering the identity (69), we notice that for i = j a block
of the form {1, y} may only occur for x = 0, ci = 1 or x = 1, ci = 1. from
(17) and the orthogonality of simple roots and co-fundamental weights, we
obtain i  

ci+1
q

2

i = q(1+ci)ti and therefore we get
tixn=1
xy

ii (1, y) qy =

[ti]q
2

qti =

1
2

q2n1 ,

(84)

which establishes the rst factor in (83). in order to prove the occurrence
of the second factor, we observe that a block of the form {2, y} may only be
generated if ci 6= cj. due to the parity property of the s (70), we may choose
ci = 1 and cj = 1 w.l.g., such that we obtain from (17) jqi = q2ti[iij]q.
hence we obtain

ij (2, y) qy =

xy

qti+tj

2

[iij]q[tj]q =

1

tjxn=1

q2n1

iijxn=1

q2n1 =

1
2

iijtjxn=1

q2n .

(85)

in the last equality we have used the fact that either tj or iij has to be one.
this establishes (83).

there are several consequences we may draw from (83). an immediate
conclusion concerns the value of the scattering matrix at vanishing rapidities.
with the remark made in section 4.1 we deduce from (83) that

sij(0) = (1)ij .

(86)

the knowledge of this value is for instance important in the context of the
thermodynamic bethe ansatz [21].

4.4.4 singularities and the generalized bootstrap

as we have seen the blocks of the form (60) are extremely useful to exhibit
the lie algebraic structure of the scattering matrix. however, they are quite

24

misleading with regard to the singularity structure due to the possible can-
cellation of zeros and poles. this may happen whenever we have a product
of two blocks {x, y}{x, y} and x, x or y, y dier by 2. it suces to con-
sider the latter case, since it will cover all examples we shall be constructing.
motivated by this observation we introduce the quantity

{x, yn} =

n1yl=0 {x, y + 2l}
= hx  1, y  1i hx + 1, y  1 + 2ni
hx + 1, y  1i hx  1, y  1 + 2ni  (  )1 , (88)

(87)

and also dene the angles


x,y,n = (x  1)h + (2n + y  1)h

.

(89)

which serve to characterize the precise location of the singularities of the
blocks {x, yn}. obviously the four zeros are situated at 
x,y,n and
the four poles at 
in order to interpret these
singularities from the physical point of view we should know when they are
situated on the physical sheet, i.e. 0  im   i. recalling that the range
for the possible arguments of the blocks 0 < x < h, 0 < y < h and the range
in which the eective coupling takes its value, i.e. 0  b  2 we evaluate

x,y,0 respectively.

x,y,0,

x,y,n)

the relevant residues are computed to

2 sinh h sinh(nh ) sinh(xh+(n1+y)h ) sinh(+

sinh(h+nh ) sinh((1+x)h+(n+y1)h ) sinh(xh+(2n+y1)h ) . (92)

x,y,n)

it is easy to convince oneself that with the stated range for x, y, b, n together
with (90) we have

im res

x,y,0{x, yn} < 0

and

25

x,y,n could correspond to the direct channel poles.

such that the +
in the
simply laced case this knowledge is enough to judge about the sign of the
residue of the whole s-matrix, e.g. [8]. for the case at hand matters are more
involved since the remaining blocks in the scattering matrix do in general not
possess a denite sign. it is this feature which lead the authors of [11] to
the formulation of the generalized bootstrap. according to this prescription
only odd order poles, whose imaginary part of the residue is positive in the
whole range of the eective coupling b, participate in the bootstrap.
n}+
in general we have lim0, {x, y
=  

. we
obtain a rst criterion for a possible sign change by considering the extreme
limits in the coupling constant.

so let us have a closer look at the behaviour of a block {x, y

this means if the block responsible for the pole is {x, yn} and the right hand
side of (94) is negative the imaginary parts of the possible additional blocks

{x, y

n}+

x,y,n

and

{x + 2, y

n}+

x,y,n

(96)

both change their sign while  runs from zero to innity. this means the
pole +
x,y,n does not participate in the bootstrap if in the scattering matrix
also the blocks (96) occur to an odd power and if they do not cross the real
axis at the same position. this means having the scattering matrix given
explicitly in blockform the condition on y, y, n, n by which the l.h.s. of (94)
becomes negative, together with the occurrence of blocks like (96) provides a
simple criterion which allows to judge whether a pole resulting from a certain
block should be excluded from the generalized bootstrap or not.

exploiting the fusing rules and reading o the relative rapidities from
(51) we obtain the precise location, say , of a pole in the scattering matrix
which participates in the generalized bootstrap

 = (i  j)h  (i  j)h .

(97)

the two signs result from the two non-equivalent solutions of the fusing rule.

26

5 matrix-integral representation

alternatively to the universal form for the scattering matrix in form of blocks
there exists a remarkable integral representation. this version of the scat-
tering matrix is particularly useful when applied in the context of the ther-
modynamic bethe ansatz [21, 22] or o-shell when computing form factors
[20]. we can express the scattering matrix as

with

dt
t

z0

sij() = exp

ij(t) sinh  t

i! ,
ij (t) = 8 sinh(ht) sinh(tjht)(cid:16)[k]q(t)q(t)(cid:17)1

ij

(98)

.

(99)

we introduced here the particular deformation parameters q(t) = exp(ht)
and q(t) = exp(h t) and the matrix

[kij]q q = (q qti + q1 qti)ij  [iij]q .

(100)

in the limit q  1 and q  1 the matrix [kij]q q obviously reduces to the
ordinary cartan matrix k, such that one is tempted to view this matrix
as a doubly q-deformed cartan matrix. however, this viewpoint is slightly
misleading as we now argue. for the simply laced cases it was proven [9], that
the conserved quantities may be organized as right eigenvectors of the cartan

matrix pj kijyj(n) = 4 sin2(sn/h) yi(n) with sn labeling the exponents of
the algebra as already introduced. in particular we have that yi(1)  mi. it
is then easy to see that this may also be re-written as

[kij]q(isn)q(isn)yj(n) = 0 .

rxj=1

(101)

hence, we can alternatively organize the conserved charges as nullvectors
of the matrix [kij]q(it)q(it) evaluated at exponents of the lie algebra, i.e.
t = isn. based on a case-by-case investigation, oota pointed out [14] that
equation (101) also holds for the non-simply laced case. a general proof of

case-by-case study.

a very similar formula was rst obtained by oota ((5.2) in [14]) on the base of a
in comparision, the formula (98) diers only by a factor (1)ij

i(cid:1)(cid:1), which is 1 for  real, but dierent from one if the rapidity

becomes complex. similar expressions also appear in [26].

exp(cid:0)2ijr 

t sinh(cid:0) t

dt

0

27

this statement is still outstanding. there is, however, one important dier-
ence in comparison with the simply laced case. in general we can not reverse
the interpretation anymore, such that we are not able to recover a genuine
eigenvalue equation. in particular for s1 = 1 this leads to

[iij]q(i)mj = 2 cosh (h + tih) mi .

xj

(102)

we observe that the eigenvalue depends now through the symmetrizer ti on
the component of the eigenvector. in the limit   0 we restore the old
picture and recover the equationpj iijyj(n) = 2 cos(sn/h)yi(n) valid for all
simple lie algebras. with the help of (11) we also obtain the equation for
the left nullvector xi(n) related to the right as yi(n) = [ti]q xi(n).
the determinant of the matrix (100) may be computed [14] to

det[k]q(it)q(it) =

ryn=1

4 sin((t + sn)/h) sin((sn  t)/h) .

(103)

we do not have a general proof of this formula, but we have veried it case-
by-case. two important features which we exploit below should be noticed
here, rst the determinant becomes independent of the coupling constant 
and second it vanishes for t being an exponent.

before we provide the proof for the representation (98), we will introduce

two further auxiliary matrices.

5.1 the m-matrix

we restrict now the sum of the generating function for the powers of the
building blocks (69) to a nite range and also include an additional defor-
mation parameter q into our consideration. we dene the matrix

mij(q, q) =

2hxx=1

2hxy=1

ij(x, y)qx qy

,

(104)

where initially we keep both deformation parameters completely generic.
from the properties for the s, which we deduced in section 4.2., we can
immediately derive several features for the matrix m

mij(q, q) = q2h q2h mij(q1, q1) = mji(q, q) .

(105)

28

the rst identity in (105) is a consequence of the two relations in (70)
together with the fact that ij(0, y) = ij(2h, y) = 0 for all y. the second
follows trivially from the symmetry properties of the s from the rst relation
in (71).

most crucial is once more the combined bootstrap equation, which on
the lie algebraic side corresponds to the property (73). in fact, this identity
will enable us to compute the matrix m explicitly. by some straightforward
manipulations of this relation we deduce with (73) that m(q, q) has to satisfy

(q1 q ti + q qti)mij(q, q) 

[iik]qmkj(q, q) =

rxk=1

1  q2h q2h

2

[ti]qij .

(106)

solving this equation for m(q, q) yields
1  q2h q2h

mij(q, q) =

2

([k]q q)1
ij

[tj]q .

(107)

at rst sight (107) does not seem to be a nite polynomial of the form
(104). however, the doubly q-deformed cartan matrix becomes singular at
certain values and the pre-factor (1  q2h q2h ) ensures the whole expression
to remain nite.
in other words this term may always be factorized into
the determinant of [kij]q q and some rest, such that the r.h.s. of (107) will
indeed be a polynomial as dened in (104).
in [26] a similar matrix as
(107) also occurs. however, apart from the ordering of [t], [k], the pre-factor
(1  q2h q2h)/2, which is crucial for the polynomial aspect we discuss below,
is not mentioned in there.
we will deviate now from our generic consideration and specify the de-
formation parameters to be q(t) and q(t) as introduced after equation (99).
noting rst of all that q(t)2h q(t)2h = e2t, we observe that for t = im
the r.h.s. of (106) always vanishes. furthermore it follows from (107) that
m(q(im), q(im)) is also always zero unless m is an exponent by (103).
from this we deduce that m(q(isn), q(isn)) is proportional to the right
nullvector y(n) as specied in (101).
in view of the symmetry property
(105), we conclude that

mij(q(isn), q(isn))  yi(n)yj(n)

(108)

where the factor of proportionality does neither depend on the particle index
i nor on j. most importantly we derive from (72) a matrix version of the

29

fusing rule (51) and (53)

xl=i,j,k

q(isn)l q(isn)l mlp(q(isn), q(isn)) = 0

for 1  p  r .

(109)
by means of (108) we may divide out yp(n) and the factor of proportionality
from (109), such that we have at last established the relation (51) involving
the conserved quantities.

we may specify the deformation parameters further and take q and q
to be roots of unity of order 2h and 2h, respectively. this may be done
safely after we have cancelled the determinant against the pre-factor. as
a consequence this means in particular that together with the periodicity
property of the s (the rst property in (70)), we may simultaneously shift
the upper and lower limit in the sum (104) arbitrarily. the properties of
the blocks are now also reected by the polynomial (104), such that we can
not only carry out a one-to-one identication between {x, y} and qx qy, but
in addition we can also manipulate them in an identical way. if in analogy
to {x,y} = {x, y}1
 , we further dene qx qy = qx qy we can even
guarantee that the range of x and y is 1  x  h, 1  y  h. with these
assumptions in mind we derive

mij(q, q) = qh qh mj(q1, q1) = qh qhmj(q, q)

(110)

from the last relation in (71).

as a nal remark of this section, we note that at roots of unity the
dening relation for the m-matrix (104) may be viewed as the discrete fourier
transformation of ij(x, y), the inverse of which reads

ij(x, y) =

1

4 h h

2hxm=1

2hxn=1

mij ( m,  n)  mx ny,

(111)

with  and  being the 2hth and 2hth primitive roots of unity, respectively.
this allows us to compute the powers of the blocks, i.e.
the s, in an
alternative way from the explicit expression of m(q, q) in matrix form (107).
we may also utilize (111) to verify the properties of the s by exploiting
now explicitly matrix representation of m(q, q), instead of the orbits of the
q-deformed coxeter element as in of section 4.2. in addition the computing
rules, which we stated in the previous paragraph for generic q and q are
automatically satised for q and q being roots of unity.

30

5.2 the n-matrix

as to be expected, we may also express the scattering matrix in terms of the
data of the twisted algebra x (l)
n . in analogy to the m-matrix (104) we dene
the n  n-matrix

nij(q, q) =

 ij(x, y)qx qy

,

(112)

2hxx=1

2hxy=1

where once again we keep both deformation parameters completely generic
for the time being.
it should be clear that our notation in (74) is slighly
abused here at the cost of avoiding the introduction of new symbols. from
the lie algebraic analogue to the combined bootstrap equation (78) we derive

(1)ti+1(qti q)2cinij + nci (i)j  xl ci

qci q2ci+ ci1

2

li+ ci+1

2 lliilnlj

= (q q)ci (1  q2h q2h)

2



1+ci

2

i

(j)

.

(113)

unlike the corresponding equation for the non-twisted case (106), we can
not solve (113) directly due to the occurrence of indices transformed by the
automorphism . however, we may consider equation (113) for i  ci(i)
and iterate the resulting equations as long as we obtain nlci (i)j = nij.
thereafter we can safely solve the equation for the r  r-submatrix, say n ,
and obtain

[lj]q .

(114)

.

(115)

here we have introduced the doubly q-deformed twisted cartan matrix

ij

2

nij(q, q) =

1  q2h q2h

(cid:16)[ k]q q(cid:17)1
[ k]q q = (q qli + q1 qli)ij 
lixk=1

ik(i)jq

note that in the classical limit q, q  1 we recover the transpose of the usual
twisted cartan matrix. the transposition results from our convention that
particles in both dual algebras are denoted by the same particle index. sim-
ilarly as in the nontwisted case the determinant of the matrix (115) acquires
a very neat form

det[ k]q(it)q(it) =

nyk=1

4 sin((t + sk)/h) sin((sk  t)/h) ,

(116)

31

where the sk denote the l-th exponents of x (l)
n [18]. we also do not have a
general proof of this formula, but we have veried it once again case-by-case.
by direct computation, we may now derive several identities for the ma-

trix n , namely

nij(q, q) = nji(q, q) = q2h q2h nij(q1, q1) .

(117)

the rst and second relation in (117) imply the rst property for the s in
(76) and the second relation in (75), respectively, which on the other hand
nally prove the inner product identities of section 2.2.3. comparing (107)
and (114) we see immediately that m = n and therefore (x, y) = (x, y).
a direct lie algebraic proof of the latter equality would be desirable since
it allows to express quantities of the twisted algebra in terms of the non-
twisted algebra and vice versa. having established several features of the
matrix m(q, q) and n (q, q) we will now supply the context in which they
naturally originate.

5.3 from block- to integral representation

concerning the representation of the scattering matrix in blockform (59), an
obvious question which arises is, whether it is possible to compute explicitly
the product over x and y. taking the explicit integral representations of the
blocks (62) into account , this problem amounts to the evaluation of

ij(t) =

1

sinh t

2hxx=1

2hxy=1

ij(x, y) f h,h

x,y (t, b),

= 
= 

8 sinh(ht) sinh(ht)

sinh t

8 sinh(ht) sinh(ht)

sinh t

etm(q(t), q(t))

et n (q(t), q(t))

(118)

(119)

(120)

if we want to transform the scattering matrix into the form (98). from
the rst identity in (105), noting that q(t)2h q(t)2h = e2t, together with the
explicit form of the m-matrix (107), we deduce the integral representation
(98) with (99).

some comments are due, since it appears that the convergence condition
(64) is violated by the range we chose for x and y in the dening relation for
m. however, for each individual block {x, y} we can exploit the properties

32

(65) and bring the arguments x and y into a range for which the integral
representation (62) is convergent. these features are reected in the m-
matrix if it is taken at roots of unity together with the already mentioned
rule qx qy = qx qy.
as an alternative proof we may proceed similar as in [22] for the simply
laced case. this method turns out to be instructive with regard to particular
applications as the thermodynamic bethe ansatz and it will illustrate the
origin of the slight dierence between (99) and the formula in [14]. first we
notice that the scattering matrix may also be written as

sij() = n exp

z0

when we introduce the quantities

ij() = i

d
d

ln sij()

and

dt

 ! ,
teij(t/) sinh  it
z

eij(k) =

dij()eik .

(121)

(122)

due to the dierentiation in (122), we have the freedom of a normalization
constant n in (121), which may be xed by some asymptotic condition. act-
ing now with i times the logarithmic derivative on the combined bootstrap
identity (we concentrate here on the case iil = 1) (82), multiplying with
exp(ik) and integrating thereafter with respect to  we obtain

rxl=1

pz d(cid:16)ij ( + h + tih) + ij (  h  tih )(cid:17) eik =
iil elj(k) .
(123)
here p denotes the cauchy principal value. alternatively we may compute
eij(k) directly. for this purpose we shift the fourier integral into the complex
plane and integrate along the contours c
due to (83) we know explicitly the occurrence of the relevant blocks which
will give a contribution when we integrate along c
 .

(125)

on the other hand the l.h.s. of (123) may be computed alternatively from
the right hand sides of (124) and (125), such that we obtain

ij (cid:17) ,
eij(k/) = 2(cid:16)ij  4 sinh kh sinh kh (2 cosh t(h + h)  i)1

(126)
and therefore (99) by means of (121). the other cases when iil = 2, 3 may
be obtained similarly with the singularity structure as indicated in gure 2.

and 2h reverse their roles.

6 reduction to the simply laced case

it is instructive to investigate how the general formulae valid for all simple
lie algebras behave when we specialize to simply laced lie algebras. con-
sidering the data of x (1)
, we notice rst of all that there is no distinction
anymore between h and h. the length of all roots is the same in the simply
laced case, such that ti = 1 for all i and the incidence matrix becomes there-
fore symmetric. the q-deformed incidence matrix reduces now to the usual
[iij]q  iij, since it does not have entries dierent
incidence matrix, i.e.
from 1. as a consequence the q-deformed weyl reections in (6) become the

r

34

ordinary weyl reections, such that q
with the c(i) and therefore the q-deformed coxeter element becomes

c(i)  c(i). the map  commutes now

q  q2+ = q2 ,

(127)

with  being the ordinary non-deformed coxeter element of x (1)
n . noting fur-
ther that co-weights become identical to weights, i.e. i  i, the generating
function (69) acquires the form
ci + cj

ci+cj

q2x

2

( j  xi) .

(128)

, y(cid:19) qy = 

1
2

2

ij(cid:18)2x 

xy
hence we always have y = 2x  ci+cj
emerges is {x, x}
hyq=1(cid:26)2q 

, 2q 

sij () =

ci + cj

2

2 iqj

ci + cj

2 (cid:27) 1



and the only type of blocks which
. therefore the block form of the scattering matrix reads

2

, x (1)

r  ade.

(129)

this means, that also conceptually the simply laced case admits a slightly
dierent formulation.
in the generic case we compute the powers of the
building blocks indirectly via a generating function, whilst in the simply
laced case we may compute them directly.
we can also consider the data of x (l)

n and undo the twist, which means
that   1, li  1 and ti  1 for all i, such that the twisted q-deformed
coxeter element becomes

(130)

(131)

q  q2+ = q2 .
therefore the generating function (74) becomes

 ij(cid:18)x, 2y 

ci + cj

2 (cid:19) qx = 

q2y
2

ci+cj

2

( j  yi) ,

xx

which means that x = 2y ci+cj
and the only type of blocks which emerge are
once again {x, x}. hence, the scattering matrix reduces also in this analysis
to the form (129).
the matrix inside the integral representation (99) for the simply laced

2

case follows likewise and acquires the form

ij (t) = 8 sinh(cid:18)bt

2h(cid:19) sinh (2  b)t

2h

! (2 cosh t/h  i)1

ij

.

(132)

hence we have recovered the formulae of [8] or [22].

the block {x, x} corresponds to the block {x} as dened in [8] or [22].

35

7 case-by-case

in order to illustrate the working of our general formulae it is useful to work
them out explicitly for some concrete examples. we concentrate here on the
non-simply laced case, since the simply laced case is covered extensively in
the literature [6]. we will be most detailed for the (g(1)
4 )-case. our
conventions with regard to numbering and colouring may be read o from
the dynkin diagrams. as usual the arrow points towards the short roots. a
black and white vertex corresponds to the colour value ci = 1 and ci = 1,
respectively.

here we indicated which block is responsible for which type of fusing process.
we have h = 6 and h = 12 for the coxeter numbers. with the help of
(67), we easily verify that for (133), (134) and (135) the following bootstrap
identities hold

s1l ( + h + h) s1l (  h  h) = s2l ()
s1l ( + 2h + 4h) s1l (  2h  4h) = s1l ()
s2l ( + 2h + 4h) s2l (  2h  4h) = s2l ()

(136)
l = 1, 2
l = 1, 2
(137)
l = 1, 2 . (138)

as an example for the working of the generalized bootstrap and our criterion
provided in section 4.4.4., we plotted the imaginary part of the residues

36

of s22() in gure 3 for several poles. we observe that the sign changes
throughout the range for poles resulting from {1, 13} and {3, 53}. only the
poles responsible for the self-coupling of particle 2 has a positive imaginary
part of the residue throughout the range of the coupling constant . except
at b = 4/3 where it is zero, such that this fusing process decouples.

(139)
for l = 1, 2. these equations may be derived from (136) and (137) or veri-
ed directly for (133), (134) and (135), with the help of (67). the process
corresponding to the combined bootstrap identity (139) is depicted in gure

.

(140)

we may construct all these formulae from the lie algebraic data in two

alternative ways.

7.1.1 sij () from g(1)
2

1 q

we start by exploiting the properties of g(1)
2 . the non-vanishing entries of the
incidence matrix are i12 = 1 and i21 = 3. consequently equation (11) yields
t1 = 1 and t2 = 3. as indicated in the dynkin diagram we choose c1 = 1
and c2 = 1, such that the q-deformed coxeter element reads q = q
2 .
the result of successive actions of this element on the simple roots is reported
in table 1. here and in all further tables we choose the following conventions:
to each i we associate a column in which we report the powers of the q of
the coecients of the simple roots. we abbreviate
(q1
r )r  1
lr ,
(141)
with r = rank g. when q occurs x-times we denote this by x. like in the
undeformed case the overall sign of any element in q is denite. therefore
it suces to report the sign only once as stated in (141). in the complete
orbit we always have an equal number of plus and minus signs. when we do
not report any signs in the column at all, the signs of the column to the left
are adopted. in case the coecient of the root is zero, we indicate this by a
. for instance from table 1 we read o : q1 = (q4 + q6)1  q42.

(142)

(143)

(144)

we may now read o the lie algebraic data from the table 1 and we can
construct the scattering matrices (133), (134) and (135) according to formula
(59).

the two non-equivalent solutions to (42) corresponding to the s-matrix

bootstrap equations (136), (137) and (138) read

q1

q 1 + q11 = q32,

q44

q2 + q202 = 5

q2 ,

(145)

(146)

(147)

respectively. these relations may be obtained either from (136), (137) and
(138) together with the formulae which relate the fusing angles to the solu-
tion of the fusing rules in terms of the q-deformed coxeter element (57) or
alternatively they may be read o directly from table 1. for a direct com-
parison with (57) one should cross all term to one side of the equation by
means of (19).

it is also instructive to consider explicitly the matrix representation and
verify the general formulae of section 5. the doubly qdeformed cartan

39

matrix for generic q and q reads

[k]q q =  q q + q1 q1

(1 + q2 + q2) q q3 + q1 q3 !

1

(148)

with determinant det[k]q q = q2 q4 + q2 q4  1. the right nullvectors are
evaluated to

y(1) = (sinh(h + h ), sinh(2h + 2h))
y(2) = (sinh(5h + 5h), sinh(10h + 10h)) .

instead of using the data from g(1)
2 , we can also employ the properties of
d(3)
4 . as indicated in the dynkin diagram, we choose the values of the bi-
colouration to be c1 = 1 and c2 = c3 = c4 = 1. our conventions for the
incidence matrix i, the action of  on the simple roots and the action of the
automorphism  on the simple roots are

8 conclusion

we have systematically developed the properties of the q-deformed cox-
eter element and its twisted counterpart. the vanishing of the three-point-
coupling is governed by the so-called fusing rules. they rules may be formu-
lated either in the orbits q, q or  and . the precise relation between
these alternative rules is worked out (57). all of these identities may be
proven by appealing to physical arguments. the scattering matrices of ane
toda eld theories with real coupling constant related to any dual pair of
simple lie algebras may be expressed in a completely generic way in terms
of combinations of hyperbolic functions whose powers are computed from
generating functions involving either q-deformed coxeter elements (69) or
alternatively twisted q-deformed coxeter elements (74). the q-deformation
appears to be vital in the construction since it achieves that the properties
of the two dual algebras are merged together.
it would be interesting to
investigate whether it is possible at all to construct generic formulae solely
from non-deformed quantities as it is possible in the simply laced case. how-
ever, it appears to us that the q-deformation is vital to describe non-simply
laced theories. closely related to this is the question of how to derive the
q-deformed versions of the fusing rules directly from the non-deformed ver-
sions. we have demonstrated that the proposed scattering matrices fulll all
the requirements of the generalized bootstrap equations. in particular, we
established the equivalence of the fusing rules and the generalized s-matrix
boostrap equations. furthermore, we provide a simple criterion which allows
to exclude poles from the participation in the bootstrap.

it is intriguing that the combined bootstrap equation (82) incorporates
the information of all individual fusing processes. these equations do in fact
not constitute anything new since they may always be obtained from the
individual fusing processes. they correspond to particular graphs (see gure
5 and 6) of higher order.

the matrix [k]q q plays a central role in several ways. the components of
its nullvectors constitute conserved quantities, e.g. the particle masses. we
show how these quantities are related to the fusing rules. the properties of
the matrix [k]q q are further utilized in order to formulate a matrix m which
serves to derive and prove a generic integral representation for the scattering
matrix. the same goal may be achieved by exploiting the properties of the
matrix [ k]q q which is related to the twisted algebra and allows to dene the
matrix n . we established the equality between these two matrices.

53

it is interesting to note that the properties of the blocks are reected by
the polynomial (104), such that we can carry out a one-to-one identication
between {x, y} and qx qy. in addition we can also manipulate them in an
identical way if we further dene qx qy = qx qy in analogy to {x,y} =
{x, y}1
 or choose q and q to be roots of unity. this means we can treat the
whole bootstrap properties in an entirely polynomial fashion.

from the matrix relation n = m one deduces immediately the equality
(x, y) = (x, y). however, it remains a challenge to develop a more direct
lie algebraic understanding of the equation.
