abstract

we study the absorption probability of minimally-coupled massive scalars by extremal

p-branes. in particular, we nd that the massive scalar wave equation under the self-dual

string background has the same form as the massless scalar wave equation under the dyonic

string background. thus it can be cast into the form of a modied mathieu equation and

solved exactly. another example that we can solve exactly is that of the d = 4 two-charge

black hole with equal charges, for which we obtain the closed-form absorption probability.

we also obtain the leading-order absorption probabilities for d3-, m2- and m5-branes.

introduction

there has been considerable interest recently in studying absorption probabilities for elds

propagating in various black hole and p-brane backgrounds [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. one of the motivations is the conjectured duality of supergravity on

an ads spacetime and the conformal eld theory on the boundary of the ads [19, 20, 21].

previously, the study of absorption was mainly concentrated on the case of massless scalars.

some work has been done for the cases of the emission of bps particles from ve- and four-

dimensional black holes [2]. these bps particles can be viewed as pp-waves in a spacetime of

one higher dimension. hence they satisfy the higher-dimensional massless wave equations.

in this paper, we consider the absorption probability of minimally-coupled massive par-

ticles by extremal p-branes. the wave equation for such a scalar depends only on the metric

of the p-brane, which has the form

ds2 =

d

where d = p + 1 is the dimension of the world volume of the p-brane, d = d  d  2, and
h = 1 + q/r d are harmonic functions in the transverse space ym, where r2 = ym ym.
(note that the adm mass density and the physical charges of the extreme p-brane solutions

are proportional to pn

i=1 qi and qi, respectively)

it follows that the wave equation, m (g gm n n ) = m2 , for the massive minimally-

coupled scalar, with the ansatz, (t, r, i) = (r) y (i) eit, takes the following form:

for minimally-coupled massless scalars is not invariant under the vertical-dimensional re-

duction, but is invariant under double-dimensional reduction of the corresponding p-brane

[18]. however, for massive scalars, the wave equation (1.2) is not invariant under either

double or vertical reductions.

the absorption probability of massless scalars is better understood. it was shown that

for low frequency the cross-section/frequency relation for a generic extremal p-brane coin-

cides with the entropy/temperature relation of the near extremal p-brane [18]. there are a

few examples where the wave equations can be solved exactly in terms of special functions.

notably, the wave equations for the d3-brane [14] and the dyonic string [17] can be cast

1

into modied mathieu equations. hence, the absorption probability can be obtained ex-

actly, order by order, in terms of a certain small parameter. there are also examples where

the absorption probabilities can be obtained in closed-form for all wave frequencies [18].

when the mass m is non-zero, we nd that there are two examples for which the wave

function can be expressed in terms of special functions and, thus, the absorption proba-

bilities can be obtained exactly. one example is the wave equation in the self-dual string

background, which can be cast into a modied mathieu equation. therefore, we can obtain

the exact absorption probability, order by order, in terms of a certain small parameter. we

discuss this example in section 2. another example is the wave equation for the d = 4

two-charge black hole with equal charges. the wave function can be expressed in terms

of kummers regular and irregular conuent hypergeometric functions. it follows that we

can obtain the absorption probability in closed-form, which we present in section 3.

in

both of the above examples, the massive scalar wave equation has the same form as the

massless scalar wave equation under the backgrounds where the two charges are generically

non-equal.

however, in general, the massive scalar wave equation (1.2) cannot be solved analytically.

for low-frequency absorption, the leading-order wave function can be obtained by matching

wave functions in inner and outer regions. in section 4, we make use of this technique to

obtain the leading-order absorption probability for d3-, m2- and m5-branes.

2 massive scalar absorption for the self-dual string
for the self-dual string (q1 = q2  q), we have d = d = 2 and 1 = 2   = q. it

follows that the wave equation (1.2) becomes

where

1 =  ,

2 = q1  (m/)2 ,

 = q1  (m/)2 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

thus the wave equation of a minimally-coupled massive scalar on a self-dual string has

precisely the same form as that of a minimally-coupled massless scalar on a dyonic string,
where 1 and 2 are associated with electric and magnetic charges. it was shown in [17]
that the wave equation (2.1) can be cast into the form of a modied mathieu equation, and

2

hence the equation can be solved exactly. to do so, one makes the following denitions

() =

1


()

 = q1 2 ez .

the wave equation (2.1) then becomes the modied mathieu equation [17]

 + (82 cosh(2z)  42)  = 0 ,

where

the mathieu equation can be solved, order by order, in terms of 2. the result was

obtained in [17], using the technique developed in [22]. (for an extremal d3-brane, which

also reduces to the mathieu equation, an analogous technique was employed in [14].) in our

case there are two parameters, namely r and m/. we present results for two scenarios:

2.1 fixed mass/frequency ratio probing

in this case, we have m/ =  xed. the requirement that  is small is achieved by

considering low-frequency and, hence, small mass of the probing particles. in this case, 

is xed, and the absorption probability has the form [17]

p =

xk=0

(2.7)

where  = e , and  is eulers constant. the prefactor is chosen so that b0,0 = 1. our
results for the coecients bn,k with k  n  3 for the rst four partial waves,  = 0, 1, 2, 3,
were explicitly given in [17]. in particular the result up to the order of 2 is given by [17]

( + 1)2 (cid:16)1 + 2( + 1) ( + 1)(cid:17) + i , (2.8)

where (x)  (x)/(x) is the digamma function.

2.2 fixed mass probing

now we consider the case where the mass of the test particle is xed. in this case, it is

ensured that  is small by considering the limiting frequency of the probing particle, namely

3

  m+, i.e. the particle is non-relativistic. in this limit, the value of  becomes large
(while at the same time the expansion parameter  can still be ensured to remain small).
furthermore, we shall consider a special slice of the parameter space where 2, given in

(2.5), is xed. the absorption probability for xed  was obtained in [17]. it is of particular
interest to present the absorption probability for   0, given by

p =

3 (4(3)  3)

4 log 

2 + (2 log )2 + o(8)(cid:17) ,

(2.9)

where  = e . when 2 < 0, we dene 2 = i , and nd that the absorption probability

becomes oscillatory as a function of , given by [17]

p =

sinh2 2

sinh2 2 + sin2(  4 log )

+  ,

where

.

note that the   0 limit is a dividing domain between the region where the absorption
probability has power dependence of  (2 > 0) and the region with oscillating behavior

on  ( < 0).

3 closed-form absorption for the d = 4 two-charge black hole

for a d = 4 black hole, specied in general by four charges q1, q2, p1 and p2 [23], we have
d = d = 1. we consider the special case of two equal non-zero charges (q1 = q2  q with
p1 = p2 = 0) and therefore 1 = 2   = q. it follows that the wave equation (1.2)
becomes

1 =

p1  (m/)2
 = q1  (m/)2 ,

2 = q1  (m/)2 ,

thus the wave equation of a minimally-coupled massive scalar on a d = 4 black hole with

two equal charges has precisely the same form as that of a minimally-coupled massless scalar

on a d = 4 black hole with two dierent charges. the closed-form absorption probability

for the latter case was calculated in [18] (see also [24]). the absorption probability for the

former case is, therefore, given by

p () =

(3.4)

with p () = 0 if   + 1
takes the (non-singular) form p () = 1  e242(2+1)2 , with   mq.

2 . in the non-relativistic case (  m+), the absorption probability

the total absorption cross-section is given by:

(abs) = x

1
2

( + 1)

2  m2 p ()

(3.5)

it is oscillatory with respect to the dimensionless parameter, m   q = . (m is the
adm mass of the black hole.) this feature was noted in [25] for schwarzschild black holes

and conjectured to be a general property of black holes due to wave diraction. probing

particles feel an eective nite potential barrier around black holes, inside of which is an

eective potential well. such particles inhabit a quasi-bound state once inside the barrier.

resonance in the partial-wave absorption cross-section occurs if the energy of the particle

is equal to the eective energy of the potential barrier. each partial wave contributes a

spike to the total absorption cross-section, which sums to yield the oscillatory pattern. as

the mass of the probing particles increases, the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern of the

total absorption cross-section decreases.

4 leading-order absorption for d3, m2 and m5-branes

in the previous two sections, we considered two examples for which the massive scalar

wave equations can be solved exactly. in general, the wave function (1.2) cannot be solved

analytically. in the case of low frequency, one can adopt a solution-matching technique to

obtain approximate solutions for the inner and outer regions of the wave equations. in this

section, we shall use such a procedure to obtain the leading-order absorption cross-sections

for the d3, m2 and m5-branes.

we now give a detailed discussion for the d3-brane, for which we have d = 10, d = d = 4

and n = 1. we dene   r. it follows that the wave equation (1.2) becomes
(cid:17)() = 0.

thus, we are interested in absorption by the coulomb potential in 6 spatial dimensions.
for r  1 we can solve this problem by matching an approximate solution in the inner
region to an approximate solution in the outer region. to obtain an approximate solution

where a and b are constants to be determined.

our previously imposed low-energy condition, r  1, is sucient for there to be an
overlapping regime of validity for conditions (4.3) and (4.9), allowing the inner and outer

solutions to be matched. within the matching region, all cylinder functions involved have

small arguments. we use the same asymptotic forms of the cylinderfunctions as used by

[18]. we nd that b = 0 and

a =

4+2( + 3)( + 2)
(1  ( m

(4.12)

the absorption probability is most easily calculated in this approximation scheme as the

ratio of the ux at the horizon to the incoming ux at innity. in general, this ux may be

dened as

f = i

d+1( 


  

 


) ,

(4.13)

where  here is taken to be the in-going component of the wave. from the approximate

solutions for  in the inner and outer regions, where the arguments of the cylinder functions

are large, we nd that the in-going uxes at the horizon and at innity are given by

fhorizon =

4


4r8,

f =

a2
4 .

thus, to leading order, the absorption probability, p  fhorizon/f, is

p () =

 )2)+2(r)4+8
2(1  ( m
42+3( + 2)2[( + 1)!]4

(4.14)

(4.15)

in general, the phase-space factor relating the absorption probability to the absorption

cross-section can be obtained from the massless scalar case considered in [26] with the
replacement  

2  m2:

() = 2n2n/21(n/2  1)( + n/2  1)  + n  3



!(2  m2)(1n)/2p ()

(4.16)

where n = d  d denotes the number of spatial dimensions. thus, for the d3-brane we nd

(l)
3brane =

4( + 3)( + 1)[1  (m/)2]1/2

(3)24+3[( + 1)!]4

4l+3r4l+8 .

(4.17)

as can be seen, within our approximation scheme, the eects of a nonzero scalar mass

amount to an overall factor in the partial absorption cross-section. also, the s-wave absorp-

tion cross-section is increased by m and the higher partial wave absorption cross-sections

are diminished by m. this is to be expected, since the scalar mass serves to increase

gravitational attraction as well as rotational inertia.

7

the above approximation scheme can be applied to massive scalar particles in all n = 1
p-brane backgrounds except for the case of d = 11 p-branes with d = 4 and d = 5, in which

cases the scalar mass term cannot be neglected in the inner region. for n > 1, we are

unable to nd solvable approximate equations which give an overlapping inner and outer

region.

for the m2-brane, we have d = 11, d = 3, d = 6 and n = 1:

(l)
m2brane =

5( + 5)( + 4)[1  (m/)2]1/2

(15)23+2!( + 2)!2( 3+
2 )

3+2r3+9

(4.18)

for the m5-brane, we have d = 11, d = 6, d = 3 and n = 1:

(l)
m5brane =

22+53( + 2)( + 3/2)( + 1)[( + 1)!]2[1  (m/)2]1/2

(2 + 3)2[(2 + 2)!]4

6+5r6+9

(4.19)

in fact, for all n = 1 p-branes, other than the two for which the approximation scheme

cannot be applied, the partial absorption cross-sections have the same additional factor due

to the scalar mass:


massive = 

massless[1  (m/)2]1/2,

(4.20)

for m  , and 
massless has the same form as the leading-order absorption for massless
scalars. note that the suppression [enhancement] of the partial cross-section for   1 [for
 = 0], when the non-relativistic limit is taken.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have addressed the absorption cross-section for minimally-coupled massive

particles in the extreme p-brane backgrounds.

in particular, we found exact absorption

probabilities in the cases of the extreme self-dual dyonic string in d = 6 and two equal-

charge extreme black hole in d = 4. notably these two examples yield the same wave

equations as that of the minimally coupled massless scalar in the d = 6 extreme dyonic

string, and two charge d = 4 extreme black hole backgrounds, respectively. namely,

one of the two charge parameters in the latter (massless) case is traded for the scalar

mass parameter in the former (massive) case. thus, for these equal charge backgrounds,

the scattering of minimally-coupled massive particles can be addressed explicitly, and the

distinct behavior of the absorption cross-section on the energy  (or equivalently momentum
p 
gives rise to a distinct, resonant-like absorption behavior in the case of the self-dual dyonic

2  m2) is studied. in particular, the non-relativistic limit of the particle motion

string.

8

we have also found corrections due to the scalar mass for the leading-order absorption

cross-sections for d3-, m2- and m5-branes. in particular, in the non-relativistic limit, there

is the expected suppression [enhancement] in the absorption cross-section for partial waves
  1 [ = 0].

the results obtained for the absorption cross-section of the minimally-coupled massive

scalars, in particular those in the extreme self-dual dyonic string background, may prove

useful in the study of ads/cft correspondence [19]. namely, the near-horizon region
of the extreme dyonic string background has the topology of ads3  s3, with the ads3
cosmological constant  and the radius r of the three-sphere (s3) related to the charge
q of the self-dual dyonic string as  = r2 = q (see e.g., [27]). on the other hand, the
scattering of the minimally-coupled massive elds (with mass m) in the ads3 background
yields information [20, 21] on the correlation functions of the operators of the boundary
sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) conformal eld theory [28] with conformal dimensions h = 1
2 (1 
1 + m22) [29]. the scattering analyzed here corresponds to that of a minimally-coupled

massive scalar in the the full self-dual string background, rather than in only the truncated

ads3 background. these explicit supergravity results may,

in turn, shed light on the

pathologies of the conformal eld theory of the dyonic string background [30].
