1 introduction

one of the most fascinating properties of the ads/cf t correspondence [1, 2, 3] is the deep
relation between supergravity and gauge theory dynamics, at least in the regime where
the supergravity approximation (small spacetime curvature) is a reliable description of
a more fundamental theory such as string or m theory [4, 5].

although many tests have been performed in the case of maximal supersymmetry,
relating for instance, the dynamics of n coincident d3 branes (for large n) and type iib
supergravity compactied on ads5  s5 [4], much less is known on the dual theories for
a lower number of supersymmetries [6], where the candidate models exhibit a far richer
structure since they contain a variety of matter multiplets with additional symmetries
other than the original r-symmetry dictated by the supersymmetry algebra [7].

a particularly interesting class of models are obtained by assuming that s5 is replaced
by a vedimensional coset manifold x5 = g/h with some killing spinors. as shown in
[8] there is a unique such manifold x5 = t pq =

su(2)  su(2)

u(1)

with p = q = 1, where

p and q dene the embedding of the h = u(1) group into the two su(2) groups . the
supergravity theory on ads5  t 11 is an n = 2 supergravity theory with a matter gauge
group g = su(2)  su(2). the corresponding four dimensional conformal eld theory
must then be [9] an n = 1 yangmills theory with a avour symmetry g such that an
accurate test of the ads/cf t correspondence could be made using the knowledge of the
entire spectrum of the supergravity side of this theory.

the conformal eld theory description of iib on ads5  t 11 was constructed by
klebanov and witten [9] and it was the rst example of a conformal theory describing
branes at conifold singularities. the same theory was later reobtained by morrison and
plesser [10] by adopting a general method of studying branes at singularities [11]. infact,
under certain conditions, a conical singularity in a calabiyau space of complex dimension
n can be described by a cone over an einstein manifold x2n1. in the case of x5 = t 11
such construction gives rise to a conformal eld theory with singleton [12] degrees of
freedom a and b each a doublet of the factor groups su(2) su(2) and with conformal
anomalous dimension a,b = 3/4. moreover the gauge group g is su(n)  su(n) and
the two singleton (chiral) multiplets are respectively in the (n, n) and (n, n) of g.

an innite set of chiral operators of this theory which are the analogue of the kaluza
klein (kk) excitations of the n = 4 yangmills theory with su(n) gauge group is given
by tr(ab)k with rcharge k and in the ( k
2 , k
2 ) representation of su(2)  su(2). the
existence of this innite family of chiral operators (massive n = 2 hypermultiplets in the
supergravity language ) has been conrmed by gubser [13] by a study of the eigenvalues of
the scalar laplacian when performing harmonic analysis of iib supergravity on ads5t 11.
moreover the matching of gravitational and r-symmetry anomalies in the two theories

have been also proved in ref. [13].

this paper analyses the complete spectrum of the kk states on ads5  t 11 and infers

1

its multiplet structure as done in previous investigations for maximal supersymmetry.
in that case the kk spectrum, analysed in terms of ads representations in [14, 15], was
interpreted in terms of n = 1 conformal superelds in [3] and in terms of the n = 4 one in
[16] and [17]. the knowledge of all the mass matrices in the kk spectrum allows to study
the multiplet shortening conditions [18]. the shortening is proven to correspond to three
types of shortening of the su(2, 2|1) superalgebra representations, as discussed in [19] and
[20]: massless ads multiplets, short ads multiplets and semilong ads multiplets. these
multiplets, in the conformal eld theory language, correspond to respectively conserved,
chiral and semiconserved superelds which have all protected dimensions and which
therefore correspond to very particular shortening conditions in the kk context.

we show a full and detailed correspondence between all the cft operators and the
kk modes for the conformal operators of preserved scaling dimension. we also show that
there exist other operators corresponding to long multiplets but having nonrenormalised
conformal dimension. interestingly enough, these operators seem to be the lowest dimen-
sional ones for a given structure appearing in the supersymmetric borninfeld action of
the d3brane on ads5  t 11 [21, 22, 25, 26].

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 the harmonic analysis of iib super-
gravity on ads5  t 11 is performed and the complete mass spectrum of the theory is
exhibited. in sec. 3 properties of n = 1 fourdimensional supersymmetric eld theories
are recalled, in particular the supereld realisation of dierent short and long supercon-
formal multiplets of the su(2, 2|1) superalgebra.

in sec. 4 a comparison of superelds of protected dimensions and states in the kk
spectrum is made using the formula giving the massconformal dimension relations as
predicted by the ads/cf t correspondence.

2 harmonic analysis on t 11

in this section we give a summary of the derivation of the full mass spectrum of type
iib supergravity compactied on ads5  t 11 obtained by kk harmonic expansion on
t 11. since our main goal here is the comparison of the mass spectrum with the composite
operators of the cft at the boundary of ads5, we just sketch the general procedure and
postpone a detailed derivation of our results to a forthcoming pubblication [27]. partial
results were obtained in [13, 28] using dierent methods.

2.1 t 11 geometry

let us start with a short discussion of the t 11 geometry5.

we consider two copies of su(2) with generators ta, ta, (a = 1 . . . 3):

[ ta, tb] = ab
5 for details about the notations and conventions see the appendix.

[ta, tb] = ab

ctc,

(2.1)

we decompose the lie algebra g of su(2) su(2) with respect to the diagonal generator
(2.2)

th  t3 + t3,

as

where the subalgebra h is made of the single generator th and the coset algebra k
contains the generators ti (i = 1, 2), ts (s = 1, 2), and

g = h + k,

(2.3)

in terms of this new basis the commutation relations are

t5 = t3  t3.

[ti, tj] =

ij(th + t5),

[t5, ti] = [th, ti] = i

[t5, ts] = [th , ts] = s

(2.4)

(2.5)

[ti, ts] = [t5, th] = 0.

we introduce the coset representative l of

subgroup of g generated by th

su(2)  su(2)

uh (1)

, uh(1) being the diagonal

l(yi, ys, y5) = exp tiyi  exp tsys  exp t5y5,

and construct the left invariant form on the coset

l1dl = iti + s ts + 5t5 + hth,

where the oneforms {i, s, 5, h} satisfy the maurercartan equations

d +

c 

   = 0,

, ,   {i, s, 5, h}.

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

the oneforms k  {i, s, 5} are kvalued and can be identied with the ve vielbeins
of g/h = t 11, while h is hvalued and is called the hconnection of the coset manifold.
it is convenient to rescale the k and dene as vielbeins v a  (v i, v s, v 5):

v i = a i,

v s = b s,

v 5 = c 5,

(2.9)

where a, b, c are real rescaling factors which will be determined by requiring that t 11 is
an einstein space [29, 31].

once we have the vielbeins, we may construct the riemann connection oneform

bab  bba (a, b = i, s, 5), imposing the torsionfree condition

dv a  babvb = 0.

2.2 harmonic calculus

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

an essential tool for the computation of the laplacebeltrami invariant operators on t 11
is the evaluation of the covariant derivative d  (di,ds,d5). starting from the denition
(2.17)

d = d + babtab  d + b,

where tab are the so(5) generators written as matrices: (tab)cd = cd
h + m, one can write

ab, setting b =

d = dh + m,

4

(2.18)

where the hcovariant derivative is dened by

and the matrix of oneforms m can be computed from (2.11)

dh = d + h

m ij =  c 
m st = c 

a2

4c! v 5ij,
4c! v 5st,

m 5i =

a2
4c

ijvj,

m 5s = 

a2
4c

stvt,

(2.19)

(2.20)

m is = 0.

the usefulness of the decomposition (2.18), (2.19), (2.20) lies in the fact that the
action of dh on the basic harmonic represented by the t 11 coset representative l1 can
be computed algebraically. indeed one has quite generally [30, 31]

dh = r(a)tav a  a(tiv i + tsv s)  ct5v 5,

(2.21)

where r(i) = r(s) = a, r(5) = c are the rescalings and ta are the coset generators of t 11.
in summary, the covariant derivative on the basic harmonic l1 can be written as

follows

or, in components, using (2.20),

dl1 = (r(a)ta + m abtab)l1,

dil1 =  ati 
dsl1 =  ats +
d5l1 =  ct5  2 c 

jt5j! l1,
tt5t! l1,
4c! (t12  t34)! l1.

(2.22)

(2.23)

in a kk compactication, after the linearisation of the equations of motion of the
eld uctuations, one is left with a dierential equation on the tendimensional elds
[]
[1,2](x, y)

([]

x + [1,2]

y

)[]

[1,2](x, y) = 0.

(2.24)

here the eld []
[1,2](x, y) transforms irreducibly in the representations []  [e0, s1, s2] of
su(2, 2)  o(4, 2) and [1, 2] of so(5) and it depends on the coordinates x of ads5 and
y of t 11. x is the kinetic operator for a eld of quantum number [] in vedimensional
ads space and
y is the kinetic operator for a eld of spin [1, 2] in the internal space
t 11. (in the following we omit the index [] on the elds).

expanding [1,2](x, y) in the harmonics of t 11 transforming irreducibly under the
y on

isometry group of t 11, one is reduced to the problem of computing the action of
the harmonics, whose eigenvalues dene the ads mass.

5

y is a laplacebeltrami operator on t 11 and it is constructed, for every representation
[1, 2], in terms of the covariant derivative on g/h. since the covariant derivative acts
algebraically on the basic vector or spinor harmonic l1 (in terms of which any harmonic
can be constructed), the problem of the mass spectrum computation is reduced, via
(2.22)(2.23) to a purely algebraic problem.

the explicit evaluation of the linearised equation (2.24) for the vedimensional case
has been given in [32] and we will adopt the same notations therein to denote the ve
dimensional spacetime elds appearing in the harmonic expansion. note that (2.24) has
been evaluated in [32] around the background solution presented in [8]:

fabcde = eabcde,
fmnpqr = emnpqr,
b = am n = 0,

ra
rm

b = 2e2a
b ,
n = 2e2m
n ,

m =  = 0,

(2.25)

where the eld fabcde and fmnpqr is the projection on t 11 and ads5 of the tendimensional
veform f dened as f = da4, a4 being the real selfdual fourform of type iib
supergravity. the other elds of type iib supergravity are: the metric gm n (x, y) with
internal and spacetime components g(y), g(x) whose ricci tensors in this background
are given in (2.25) and the complex 0form and 2form b and am n (the fermionic elds
m and  are obviously zero in the background (2.25)).

2.3 harmonic expansion

the harmonics on the coset space t 11 are labelled by two kinds of indices, the rst
labelling the particular representation of the isometry group su(2)  su(2) ur(1) and
the other referring to the representation of the subgroup h  uh(1). the harmonic is
thus denoted by y (j,l,r)
(y) where j, l are the spin quantum numbers of the two su(2) in
a given representation, q is the uh(1) charge and r denotes the ur(1) quantum number
associated to the generator t5 orthogonal to th. we can identify r as the rsymmetry
quantum number [13, 28].

(q)

now we observe that uh (1) is necessarily a subgroup of so(5), the tangent group
of t 11. the embedding formula of uh (1) in a given representation of so(5) labelled by
indices , , is given by [30, 31]

(th )

 = ch

ab(tab)

,

(2.26)

where the structure constants ch
so(5) generators.

ab are derived from the algebra (2.5) and tab are the

in the vector representation of so(5) we nd

(th)ab = chab = 


6

ij



,




0

(2.27)

while for the spinor representation we get

(th) = ch

ab(tab) =

(12 + 34) = i

,

(2.28)

where  are the so(5) gamma matrices.

the above results imply that an so(5) eld [1,2](x, y) can be splitted into the direct
sum of uh(1) onedimensional fragments labelled by the uh(1) charge q. from (2.27) and
(2.28) it follows that the vedimensional and fourdimensional so(5) representations
break under uh (1) as

5  1  1  1  1  0 [1, 2] = [1, 0],
4  1  1  0  0

[1, 2] = [1/2, 1/2].

(2.29)

from (2.29) we easily nd the analogous breaking law for antisymmetric tensors
([1, 2] = [1, 1]), symmetric traceless tensors ([1, 2] = [2, 0]) and spin tensors ([1, 2] =
[3/2, 1/2]) by taking suitable combinations:

10  1  1  2  0  0  0  0
[1, 2] = [1, 1],
16  2  2  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0 [1, 2] =h 3
2i ,
2, 1
14  2  2  2  1  1  0  0  0  0
[1, 2] = [2, 0].
actually it is often more convenient to write down the harmonic expansion in terms

(2.30)

of the so(5) harmonics y (j,l)

[1,2] whose fragments are the y (j,l,r)

(q)

introduced before.

the generic eld [1,2](x, y) can be expanded in these harmonics as follows

ab...(x, y) = x() x(m)

()(m)(x)y ()(m)

ab...

(y),

(2.31)

where a, b, . . . are so(5) tensor (or spinor) indices of the representation [1, 2], () is a
shorthand notation for (j, l, r) and m labels the representation space of (j, l, r). in our case
m coincides with the labelling of the uh(1) fragments. it is well known [30, 31] that the
irrepses of su(2)su(2) appearing in the expansion (2.31) are only those which contain,
when reduced with respect to uh(1), a charge q also appearing in the decomposition of
[1, 2] under uh (1).

it is easy to see which are the constraints on j, l, r selecting the allowed representations
() appearing in (2.31). we write a generic representation of su(2) su(2) in the young
tableaux formalism:

a particular component of (2.32) can be written as

(2.32)

(2.33)

and we have

( 2j = m1 + m2
2j3 = m2  m1

,

( 2l = n1 + n2
2l3 = n2  n1

.

(2.34)

furthermore (recalling the denitions (2.2)(2.4)) we get

thy (j,l,r)
t5y (j,l,r)

(q)

(q)

= i q y (j,l,r)
= i r y (j,l,r)

(q)  i (j3 + l3) y (j,l,r)
(q)  i (j3  l3) y (j,l,r)

(q)

(q)

hence

,
.

(2.35)

(2.36)

2j3 = q + r  m2  m1,
2l3 = q  r  n2  n1.

now we observe that as long as m2  m1 and n2  n1 are even or odd, the same is true for
m1 + m2 and n1 + n2. therefore the parity of 2j and 2l is the same as that of 2j3 and 2l3
and since 2j3 + 2l3 = 2q can be even or odd, the same is true for 2j + 2l. it follows that
j and l must either be both integers or both halfintegers. this means that the q value
of any uh(1) fragment of the so(5) elds is always contained in any so(5)harmonic in
the irrep (j, l) provided that j and l are both integers or halfintegers. since q + r and
q  r are related to the third component of the angular momentum of the two su(2)
factors, one also has the conditions |q + r|  2j and |qr|  2l. the two above conditions
select the harmonics appearing in the expansion.

in order to be specic it is now convenient to list all the vedimensional space
time elds appearing in the harmonic expansion together with the corresponding ten
dimensional elds, with ads5 indices and/or internal indices, following the notations of
[32] . we group them according to the appropriate so(5) bosonic (y ) or fermionic ()
harmonic .

note that the tendimensional elds h

the above list since, as shown in [32], they appear algebraically in the linearised equations
of motion and thus can be eliminated in terms of the other propagating elds.

8

to obtain the mass spectrum of the above elds we must apply the laplacebeltrami
operator to the harmonic expansion. we list such operators for the so(5)harmonics6
y (j,l)
[1,2]:

yy[0,0]  y,
yy[1,0]  2dad[ayb],
yy[1,1]  dyabv av b,

(2.37d)

(2.37e)

(2.37f)

the explicit computation of the mass matrices derived from the above laplace
beltrami dierential operators will not be worked out here and we refer the interested
reader to [27]. we can give however in the simplest cases a couple of examples of the
computation.

2.4 the scalar harmonic

the case involving scalar harmonics y (j,l)
vedimensional invariant operator is simply the covariant laplacian:

q=0 is straightforward.

[0,0] = y j,l,r

in this case the

 = dada  didi + dsds + d5d5.

(2.38)

from (2.27) and the fact that tabl1  taby j,l,r

y j,l,r

q=0 = (a2(titi + tsts)  c2t5t5)y j,l,r
q=0 ,

q=0  0, we obtain the following result
(2.39)

let us now evaluate (2.39). we set

1 1 = 2

1 2 = 1

2 1 = i 2
2 2 = i 1

3 1 = 1
3 2 =  2

6 notice that the operator on the twoform y = yabv av b is of the rst order, like the fermionic ones.

indeed it is the square root of the usual second order operator dad[aybc]:

dad[aybc]v bv c =

(the same is true for ) and observing that on a young tableaux the s act like a derivative
(leibnitz rule), we nd on the rst tableaux of (2.33)

(11 + 22)

. . .

= (2m1(m2 + 1) + 2m2(m1 + 1))
= 4(j(j + 1)  (j3)2)

. . .

.

. . .

= (2.43)

an analogous result holds when acting with 11 + 22 on the second tableaux of (2.33),
with j  l.

furthermore, the eigenvalue of (3  3)2 on (2.33) is

(m2  m1 + n2  n1)2 = 4(j3 + l3)2.

for a scalar, q = 0 and so, from (2.36), we have

j3 = l3 = r/2.

therefore, we nd

y (j,l,r)

(0) = "a2j(j + 1) + b2l(l + 1) + (4c2  a2  b2)

substituting the values of a,b and c given in (2.16), we obtain

y (j,l,r)

(0) = h0(j, l, r)y (j,l,r)

when the harmonic is not scalar, q 6= 0, the computation of the laplace beltrami
operators is more involved since the covariant derivative (2.23) is valued in the so(5) lie
algebra in the given representation [1, 2].

2.5 the spinor harmonic

we give as a further example the action of the d/ operator on the spinor representation of
so(5). from (2.23) we have

where tab are the so(5) generators in the spinor representation. a straightforward com-

.

(2.50)

when substituting the values of c and a in the matrix (2.50) we note that (2.16)
denes them only up to a sign. the right choice is dictated by supersymmetry. indeed,
the existence of a complex killing spinor (y) generating n = 2 supersymmetry in ads5
implies that it must have the form

 =

,

k, l  c

(2.51)

since, being an su(2)  su(2) singlet, it must satisfy th  = 0 (see (2.28)). at this
point the killing equation d/  = 5
2e can be computed from (2.50) observing that on an
su(2)  su(2) singlet the ta generators have a null action and thus, using (2.51),
d/  =

this gives the correct value only if we choose l = 0 and

c =

(2.53)

while the sign of a = 6 e is unessential.
recalling the meaning of c as the rescaling of the vielbein v 5, we conclude that t 11 ad-
mits a killing spinor, leading to n = 2 supersymmetry on ads5, only for one orientation
of t 11.

(2.54)

since the harmonics are really dened up to a constant, the operatorial matrix (2.54)
can be replaced by a numerical one, simply obtained by substituting in each entry the
values of the t operators on the harmonics. by diagonalization of this matrix one gets
the eigenvalues which are related to the fermion masses by numerical shifts. analogous
procedure can be used for all the other invariant operators. in general the matrices can
become very large depending on the number of uh (1) fragments in the decomposition of
[1, 2]. leaving further explanations and all the details to the forthcoming paper [27],
we now quote the results for the mass spectrum.

2.6 spectrum and multiplet structure

 we begin by the spectrum deriving from the scalar harmonic that appears in
the expansion of the tendimensional elds h(x, y), b(x, y), ha
a(x, y), a(x, y)
and a. the masses of the corresponding vedimensional elds (see table (2.3))
are thus given in terms of the scalar harmonic eigenvalue h0(j, l, r) given in (2.48).
they are

m2(h) = h0,
m2(b) = h0,

m2(, b) = h0 + 16  8qh0 + 4,
m2(a) = 8 + h0  4qh0 + 4 .

(2.55)

(2.56)

(2.57)

(2.58)

note that while the laplacian acts diagonally on the ads5 elds h(x) and b(x),
the eigenvalues for (x) and b(x), which appear entangled in the linearised equations
of motion [32], [33], have been obtained after diagonalisation of a two by two matrix.
with an abuse of notation, in tables 210 we will call , b the linear combinations
corresponding to the plus or minus signs in (2.57).

 for the vector harmonic we have found four eigenvalues

[1,0] = {3 + h0(j, l, r  2), h0 + 4  2qh0 + 4}.

and the mass spectrum of the sixteen vectors is thus

m2(a) = ( 3 + h0(j, l, r  2)
h0 + 4  2h0 + 4
h0(j, l, r  2) + 7  4h0 + 4
m2(b, ) = 
h0 + 12  6h0 + 4
h0 + 4  2h0 + 4


,

(2.59)

(2.60)

in fact, as the laplacebeltrami operator acts diagonally on the complex vector
eld a(x) we get for it eight mass values . furthermore, the vectors b(x), (x)
get mixed in the linearised equations of motion, and upon diagonalisation we nd

12

two extra masses for each eigenvalue. here also we use the same names for the
linear combinations corresponding to the plus or minus sign respectively in the
mass formulae (2.60) .

 for the antisymmetric tensor harmonics we get six eigenvalues from the laplace

beltrami operator d

and the masses

[1,1] = (cid:26)i(cid:18)1 qh0(j, l, r  2) + 4(cid:19) ,iqh0 + 4(cid:27) .
m2(b) = 

m2(a) = ( h0 + 4  2h0 + 4

5 + h0(j, l, r  2)  2qh0(j, l, r  2) + 4
h0(j, l, r  2) + 1  2qh0(j, l, r  2) + 4

h0 + 4
h0 + 4

 the spinor harmonics eigenvalues of d/ for l.h. spinors are:

,

.

(2.61)

(2.62)

[ 1

2 , 1

2 ] = (cid:26)(cid:18)1

2 qh0(r  1) + 4(cid:19) ,(cid:18)1

2 qh0(r + 1) + 4(cid:19)(cid:27)

to these we have to add further 4 eigenvalues for r.h. spinors which are obtained
from the above ones by replacing r by r. the masses for the spinors and gravitinos
are given in terms of d/ by a numerical shift

(left) gravitino : m(al) = d/ 
(left) dilatino :

5
;
2
m(l) = d/ + 1;
l ) = d/ + 3;

(left) longitudinal spinors: m((l)

(2.63)

we have not yet calculated either the eigenvalues of d/ corresponding to the vectorspinor
harmonic a which produce ads5 spinors (t ), or the eigenvalues of the symmetric trace-
less harmonic y ()
(ab). however, we know a priori how many states we obtain in these two
cases, and by a counting argument we can circumvent the problem of the explicit com-
putation of the eigenvalues of their mass matrices. for the vectorspinors we have in
principle a matrix of rank 20, that becomes 16  16 due to the irreducibility condition,
and further gets to 12  12, once the transversality condition daa = 0 is imposed. in
this way we are left with 12 nontrivial (non longitudinal) eigenvalues and thus we ex-
pect 12 (t ) spinors. in an analogous way, the traceless symmetric tensor y ()
(ab) gives a
14  14 massmatrix out of which ve eigenvalues are longitudinal leaving 9 nontrivial
eigenvalues .

if we match the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom including the 12 + 12 (right)
lefthanded spinors (t ) and the 9 real elds  of the traceless symmetric tensor we nd
128 bosonic degrees of freedom and 128 fermionic ones. therefore, once we have correctly

13

and unambiguously assigned all the elds except the (t ) and  to supermultiplets of
su(2, 2|1), the remaining degrees of freedom of (t ) and  are uniquely assigned to the
supermultiplets for their completion.

in tables 210 we have arranged our results in su(2, 2|1) supermultiplets by an ex-
austion principle, starting from the highest spin of the supermultiplet. each state of such
multiplets is labelled by the su(2, 2) quantum numbers (e0, s1, s2) other than the internal
symmetry attributes (j, l, r). as explained in section 3, e0, the ads energy, is identied
with the conformal dimension . taking into account the e0 value of each state and its
rsymmetry, we are able to t unambiguously every mass at the proper place. for this
purpose it is essential to use the following relations between the conformal weights  and
the masses:

(2)

spin 2:  = 2 +q4 + m2
spin 3/2:  = 2 + |m(3/2) + 3/2|
spin 1:  = 2 +q1 + m2
twoform:  = 2 + |m(2f )|
spin 1/2:  = 2  |m(1/2)|
spin 0:  = 2 q4 + m2

(1)

(0)

(2.64)

(where  is equal to the e0 value of the state). the sign ambiguity in the spin (0, 1
2)
dimensions is present because the unitarity bound e0  1 + s allows the possibility
e0 < 2 for such states. the spin 0 case and its implications were analysed in [33] and
noticed also in [20]. there is no such ambiguities in all the other cases.

in the theory at hand, the chiral primary t r(ab) has the scalars with e0 = 3
2,
2 coming from the  dimensions of the same k = 1 mass value. the fermionic

e0 + 1 = 5
partner is massless so there are no fermions with e0 < 2.

we have found nine families of supermultiplets: one graviton multiplet, four gravitino

multiplets and four vector multiplets which are reported in tables 210.

these are organised as follows.
in the rst column we give the (s1, s2) spin quantum numbers of the state.
in the second column we give the e0 value of the state, where, according to the
standard nomenclature, the value of e0 is referred to as the e0 of the multiplet and
belongs to a vector eld, a spin 1/2 eld or to a scalar eld for the graviton, gravitino
and vector multiplets respectively. the other states have an e0 value shifted in a range
of 2 (in 1/2 steps) with respect to the e0 of the multiplet.

in the third column we write the rsymmetry of the state where the value r is assigned
to the highest spin state (r = rh.s.), the other states having rsymmetry shifted in a range
of 2 (in integer steps).

14

in the fourth column we give the right association of that particular su(2, 2|1) state
to the eld obtained from the kk spectrum, according to the notations explained above.
in the fth column we give the mass of the state7 in terms of the ubiquitous expression
h0, where h0 is evaluated at a value r corresponding to that rsymmetry of the multiplet
dened as the rsymmetry of the highest spin r = rh.s.. we note that in all the formulae
giving the mass spectrum (2.55)(2.63), the rsymmetry r refers to the particular state
we are considering. there, h0 appears to have dependence on the r of the state which
is dierent for dierent states. however, when arranging the states in supermultiplets of
su(2, 2|1), it is convenient to express the r of the state in terms of the rsymmetry of
the supermultiplet r = rh.s., dened as the rsymmetry of the highest spin. in this case,
all the masses can be expressed in terms of an h0 which has the same dependence on
r = rh.s. for all the members of the multiplet. for the graviton multiplet and the rst two
families of vector multiplets all the masses are written in terms of h0  h0(r); for the
(left) gravitino multiplets all the masses are given in terms of h 
0  h0(j, l, r 1) and for
the last two families of vectors all the masses are given in terms of h 
0  h0(j, l, r  2).
indeed, if we compute the conformal weight  of the state from the mass values, it turns
out to be expressed in terms of h0, h 
0 which are the same for every state of the
multiplet, as it must be. of course, the value of  in terms of h0, h 
can be
computed from (2.64) and we have given for each multiplet the conformal weight of the
lowest state labelled by e0 in terms of h0.

0 , h 

0 , h

it is obvious that the multiplets of the tables 210 are long multiplets of su(2, 2|1)
since the su(2)  su(2) quantum numbers j, l and the rsymmetry values are generic.
as it is well known from group theory [5, 20] there are cases where shortening of the
multiplets can occur in correspondence with particular values of the su(2, 2|1) quantum
numbers giving rise to chiral (), semilong () or massless () multiplets. the above
symbols have been used in the colums at the left of the tables to denote the surviving
states in the shortened multiplets. in particular, the absence of these symbols in table 4
means that no shortening of any kind can occur for the gravitino multiplet ii.

in fact, these shortened multiplets are the most interesting cases to discuss in light of
the correspondence with the cft at the boundary. we give the discussion of the shorten-
ings in section 4, after a preliminary introduction to the representation of superconformal
superelds in cft and the discussion of the conformal operators of protected scaling
dimensions.

7 accordingly to (2.64) we give here the mass for the fermion and twoform elds, while for all the

other bosons we give the mass squared.

3 cft and su (2, 2|1) representations
3.1 su (2, 2|1) conformal superelds

the ads/cf t correspondence [1, 2, 3] gives a relation between the particle states in
ads5, classied in this case by the su(2, 2|1) superalgebra and the realisation of the very
same representations [2, 3, 12] in terms of conformal elds on the boundary m4 = ads5.
in this way, the highest weight representations of su(2, 2|1) correspond to primary
superconformal elds on the boundary and a generic state on the bulk,
labelled by
four quantum numbers [16] d(e0, s1, s2|r) related to u(1)  su(2)  su(2)  ur(1) 
su(2, 2)  ur(1), is mapped to a primary conformal eld o,r
(s1,s2)(x) with scaling dimen-
sion  = e0, lorentz quantum numbers (s1, s2) and r-symmetry r. e0 is the ads energy
level and its relation to the ads mass depends on the spin of the state. we recall here
the relevant cases [3, 5, 16]

it is crucial in our discussion to classify states corresponding to short multiplets be-
cause in this case the conformal dimension  is protected and it allows a stringent test
between the supergravity theory and the conformal eld theory realisation. here, pro-
tected means that  is related to the rcharge which is quantised in terms of the isometry
generator of ur(1). however, we note that unlike the n = 4 theory [22, 23], operators
with protected dimensions have conformal dimension dierent from their freeeld value.
n = 1 supermultiplets with protected and unprotected dimensions have been dis-
cussed by many authors [3, 5, 17, 20, 34]. we would like to remind here just their eld
theory realisation, which will become especially important in comparing conformal oper-
ators with the particular model described by the iib theory compactied on ads5  t 11.
a generic conformal primary supereld is classied by an sl(2, c) (s1, s2) represen-
tation, a dimension e0 and an rsymmetry charge r. these are the quantum numbers
of the  = 0 component of the supereld. all descendants are given by the  expan-
sion which also dictates their spin, rsymmetry r and scaling dimension , since 
has (s1, s2) = ( 1
2 , r = 1).
for a generic primary conformal eld the dimension is not protected since it can take
any value   2 + s1 + s2 (s1s2 6= 0) or   1 + s (s1s2 = 0) due to unitarity
bounds of the irrepses of su(2, 2). su(2, 2|1) requires the additional unitarity bound
2 + 2s1  e0  3
2 r  e0  2  2s2 (s1s2 6= 0) which restricts the allowed values of the
rsymmetry charge [20].

operators with protected dimensions fall in four categories (as discussed in [5, 17, 20,

34])

1. chiral superelds: s

they satisfy the condition

d s(s,0)(x, , ) = 0.

(3.2)

for them s2 = 0 (s1 = 0 if antichiral) and r =
superelds contain the (massless on the boundary) free singleton representations for
 = 1 + s. these multiplets have 4(2s + 1) degrees of freedom.

 if antichiral(cid:19). these

2. semichiral superelds: ua1...a2s1 , 1... 2s2

they satisfy the condition

d( u 1... 2s2 ),1...2s1 (x, , ) = 0,

(3.3)

and for them r =

( + 2s2). if s2 = 0 the above supereld becomes chiral.

for example s2 = 1

3. conserved superelds: j(s1,s2)

they satisfy

and

d1j1...2s1 , 1... 2s2 (x, , ) = 0,

d 1j1...2s1 , 1... 2s2 (x, , ) = 0,

(or d2j1...2s1 = 0 if s2 = 0) and for them r =

2
3

(s1  s2),  = 2 + s1 + s2.

4. semiconserved superelds: l(s1,s2)

they satisfy

or

d 1l1...2s1 , 1... 2s2 (x, , ) = 0,

d2l1...2s1 (x, , ) = 0

for s2 = 0.

operators of type 1) 2) and 4) have protected (but anomalous) dimensions in a non
trivial conformal eld theory. they are short or semishort because some of the elds in
the  expansion are missing. in the language of [20] the 1) and 2) superelds correspond
to the shortening conditions n+
2 = 0 and 4) to
n
2 = 0 (n

1 = 0), 3) correspond to n

2 = 0 (n+

1 = n

1 = 0).

in the ads/cf t correspondence all these superelds correspond to kk states with
multiplet shortening and typically they occur when there is a lowering in the rank of
the mass matrix and rational values of e0 are obtained. conserved current multiplets
correspond to massless elds in ads5. they can only occur for elds whose mass is
protected by a symmetry (such as gauge elds) and there is only a nite number of them
corresponding to the gauge elds of the su(2, 2|1) su(2) su(2) algebra. massive kk
states with arbitrary irrational value of e0 correspond to generic conformal eld operators
with anomalous dimension.

it is easy to relate operators of dierent type by supereld multiplication. by multi-
plying a chiral (s1, 0) by an antichiral (0, s2) primary one gets a generic supereld with
(s1, s2),  = c + a and r = 2
3 (c  a). by multiplying a conserved current supereld
j1...2s1 , 1... 2s2 by a chiral scalar supereld one gets a semiconserved supereld with
 = c + 2 + s1 + s2 (r = 2

3(  2  2s2)).

in a kk theory only particular values of (s1, s2) can occur, because the theory in higher
dimensions has only spin 2, spin 3/2 elds and lower. this implies that for bosons only
(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), ( 1
2),
( 1
2, 1) representations can occur. this drastically limits the spin of conformal superelds.

3.2 cft analysis of ads5  t 11 compactication
in the conformal eld theory [9] which is dual to iib supergravity on ads5  t 11 the
basic superelds are the gauge elds8 w of su(n)  su(n) and two doublets of chiral
superelds a, b which are in the (n, n) and ( n, n) of su(n) su(n) and in the ( 1
2, 0)
r = 1, (0, 1
2) r = 1 of the global symmetry group su(2)su(2)ur(1). at the conformal
point these superelds have anomalous dimension  = 3/4. the chiral w supereld has
 = 3/2, r = 1.

let us specify the superspace gauge transformations of the above superelds. following
[35], we introduce lie algebra valued chiral parameters 1, 2 of the two factors of g =
su(n)  su(n). then, under g gauge transformations

ev2  ei2ev2ei 2

and we dene

w1 = d dev1dev1
w2 = d dev2dev2

(3.9)

where v1 and v2 are superelds lie algebra valued in the two g factors and v = v1 + v2.
gauge covariant combinations are therefore

w(ab)k = w 1
w(ba)k = w 2

aev aev = aev2 aev1

formulae (3.10) and (3.12) transform as

x  ei1xei1

while (3.11) and (3.13) transform as

we can multiply (3.12) and (3.13) as

if a symmetry a  b is required, then symmetrization exchanging (3.10) with (3.11),

x or w 2

(3.12) with (3.13) or (3.16) with (3.17) will occur.

we will now consider sets of towers of superelds, labelled by an integral number k
which correspond to chiral and (semi)conserved gauge invariant superelds and having
therefore protected dimensions. as we will see in the next section, these conformal opera-
tors are precisely those corresponding to adskk states undergoing multiplet shortening.

let us rst consider chiral superelds. there are three innite sequences of them,

corresponding to hypermultiplets and tensor multiplets in the ads bulk.

they are given as9:

sk = t r(ab)k,

k = 3

r = k,

k > 0,

2(k + 1), r = k + 1,
r = k + 2.

k > 0,

(3.20)

k = t r (cid:16)w w(ab)k(cid:17) , k = 3 + 3

the series (3.18) was anticipated by klebanov, witten [9] and shown to occur in the
kk modes of the supergravity theory by gubser [13], who also discussed descendants of
the series (3.20).

the series (3.19)(3.20) have been constructed by the knowledge of the full mass

spectrum and the shortening conditions.

it is useful to note that in the (3.19) and (3.20) towers, we nd operators of the type

of the eld strength f.

even more interesting is the appearance of (semi)conserved superelds corresponding
in the language of [20] to semilong multiplets in ads5. these superelds explain the ap-
pearance of kk towers with (spin 1) vector elds and (spin 2) tensor elds with protected
dimensions.

in supereld language such elds are given by superelds conataining terms of the

form

note that the non gauge invariant operators in (3.23)(3.25) behave as if they would
have conformal dimension 3 and 2 respectively when the gauge singlet is formed. this
is because the shortening condition implies that operators starting with structures as in
(3.23), (3.24) and (3.25) have dimension given by 3+ 3
2k respectively.

the rst two masses vanish for the k = 0 level corresponding to the conserved currents
t rj , t rj of the superconformal eld theory with avour group g = su(2)  su(2),
while the third mass does not vanish at k = 0.

for the spin 3/2 massive tower we do not expect to get vanishing gravitino mass when
k = 0, since the massless gravitino is already contained in the graviton tower. in spite of
this, there are semiconserved superelds corresponding to shortened massive gravitino
towers.

(3.35)

in the kfold symmetric of su(3). for k > 1 these superelds are semiconserved but for
k = 1, unlike in our case, they become conserved, corresponding to the fact that on s5
an additional su(3) triplet of massless gravitinos is required by n = 4 supersymmetry.

in this case the exact operator l11

the multiplets in (3.18)(3.20), (3.23)(3.25) and (3.32)(3.34) are shortened multi-
plets with protected dimensions because of supersymmetry through nonrenormalisation
theorems. however we will see that a peculiar phenomenon of n = 1 which can be
learned from the ads/cf t correspondence is that there exist also innite towers of long
multiplets with rational dimensions which in principle are not expected to have protected
dimensions .

a typical tower which is not expected to have protected dimension is the massive

tower

(3.45)
which contains the descendant t r(ff f  f  (ab)k). supergravity predicts for it
 = 8 + 3/2k

qk = t r( w 2ev w 2ev (ab)k)

we just note that the analogous operator in type iib on ads5  s5 was a descendant
of a chiral primary (showing up at rst at p = 4 level [14, 16, 17, 26]) and therefore having
protected dimensions because of n = 4 supersymmetry [22, 23, 24].

the identication of such long multiplets with superconformal operators will be given
in the next section. operators whose rsymmetry is not related to the top components
of one of the two su(2) factors (see section 4) are for instance towers of the form

t rh(aev aev )n1(ev bev b)n2(ab)ki ,

(3.46)

which have j = k
2 + n2 and r = k. these operators have all irrational
dimensions unless n1, n2 are consecutive terms in a particular sequence described in [13].

2 + n1, l = k

it is worthwhile to point out that in this gauge theory we have no realisation of the
semichiral superelds described before and indeed we do not nd on the supergravity
side any shortened multiplet satisfying the r = 2

3(e0 + 2s2) condition (s2 6= 0).

26

4 ads/cft correspondence

in section 2 and 3 we have described the kk spectrum with its multiplet structure and the
cft operators with protected dimensions. we would like now to present the multiplet
shortening conditions and analyse the correspondence of these states with the boundary
eld theory operators shown in the last section. this is an important nontrivial check
for the ads/cf t correspondence. on the other hand, supergravity seems to suggest
additional dynamical inputs to the extent that it predicts that certain towers of long
multiplets have rational dimensions, suggesting the presence of some hidden symmetry.
this latter may perhaps be explained in the context of borninfeld theory which relates
dbrane dynamics to ads supergravity in the large n limit.

from the point of view of the su(2, 2|1) multiplet structure, the shortening conditions
correspond to saturation of some of the inequalities describing the unitarity bounds [20].
these become relations between e0 and the other su(2, 2|1) quantum numbers.

in the kk context, we do not know a priori the multiplet structure of the kk states
and the shortening conditions merely derive from the disappearance of some harmonics
in the eld expansion. this reduces the rank of the mass matrices and thus some of the
states drop from the multiplet. the relevant fact is that these shortening conditions must
be in one to one correspondence with those deriving from the su(2, 2|1) group theoretical
analysis.

as discussed in the previous section, the shortening conditions can be read as the
following relations on the su(2, 2|1) quantum numbers10 already given in section (3.1)

this means that the corresponding conformal dimension must have a rational value.
as it can easily be seen from the mass spectrum presented in section two, this implies
that only for specic g quantum numbers we can retrieve such short multiplets. actually,
a rational scaling dimension can be found only if h0(j, l, r) + 4 is a perfect square of a
rational number. two possible sets of values for which such a condition is satised are:

j = l =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

or

r

2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

l = j  1 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

r

2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

and we will show that these are the relevant ones. indeed, in the rst case h0(j, l, r) =

10 at variance with [20], we point out that the existence of conserved superelds does not necessarily

imply s1 = s2.

, while in the second case h0(j, l, r) =

of course there are other possible solutions, but we will see that only those presented

above correspond to multiplet shortening.

looking at the tables 210 we see that for the graviton and type i and ii vector
multiplets (v.m.) e0 is given in terms of h0(j, l, r) while for gravitino multiplet of type
i, iv and ii, iii e0 is given in terms of h 
0  h0(j, l, r  1) respectively. analogously, for
the type iii and iv v.m., e0 is given in terms of h 
0  h0(j, l, r  2) respectively. as a
consequence the conditions for rational values of e0 (protected dimensions) are dierent
for dierent multiplets.

let us examine the conditions (4.4)(4.5) separately.

taking into account (4.1)(4.3) we see that under condition (4.4) we obtain: a chiral
tensor multiplet from type i l.h. gravitino (4.14) (or an antichiral one from type i r.h.
gravitino); two kinds of hypermultiplets from (4.18) and (4.21) for type i and iv v.m.; a
semilong graviton multiplet from (4.13); two semilong from type iii and iv r.h. gravitino
multiplets from (4.16) and (4.17).

furthermore, for k = 0 (gsinglet), we also obtain from (4.13) a short massless gravi-
ton multiplet with e0 = 3, r = 0.
in this case only four states survive: the massless
graviton, two massless gravitini (with r = 1 depending on the chirality), and one mass-
less vector. this latter is therefore an su(2)  su(2)  ur(1) singlet and so it must be
identied with the rsymmetry killing vector.

note that (4.15), (4.19) and (4.20) do not correspond to any shortening condition,

nevertheless we have a rational value of e0 belonging to a long multiplet.

it is now easy to nd the correspondence between the supermultiplets obeying con-
dition (4.6)(4.12) and the primary conformal superelds on the cft side discussed in
the previous section. indeed, with the given values of e0 and k (or r) we have imme-
diately that the two hypermultiplets from (4.18) and (4.21) are in correspondence with
the chiral superelds sk and k (3.18) and (3.20); the tensor multiplet from (4.14) corre-
sponds to the chiral supereld t k of (3.19); the semilong graviton multiplet from (4.13),
corresponding to the semiconserved supereld j k
  of (3.23) (in particular the massless
graviton multiplet (k = 0 in (4.13)) corresponds to the conserved supereld j 0
 ); nally,
the two semilong gravitino multiplets from (4.16) and (4.17) can be put in correspondence
with the semiconserved superelds l1,k

 of (3.32) and (3.32).

 and l2k

moreover we have that there are cft superconformal operators with rational dimen-
sions which correspond to the long multiplets of (4.15),(4.19) and (4.20). indeed we may
construct the following superelds11 all in the ( k

taking into account (4.1), we see that there are no chiral supermultiplets when condi-
tion (4.5) holds. however we have that (4.33), (4.34) and (4.40) give the condition (4.3)
for semilong multiplets, all the other values of e0 corresponding to long multiplets with
rational dimensions.

thus we have: one semilong type i l.h. gravitino corresponding to the semiconserved
supereld (3.34); one semilong type i v.m. corresponding to the semiconserved super-

30

eld j k of (3.24) which, in the particular case k = 0, becomes a conserved supereld
j corresponding to the massless type i v.m. with e0 = 2, r = 0 (these correspond to
the su(2)  su(2) killing vectors); one semilong type iv v.m. corresponding to the
semiconserved supereld i k of (3.25).

furthermore we have long multiplets from (4.32), (4.35), (4.36), (4.38),(4.39) corre-

sponding respectively to the following superconformal elds with rational dimensions

gk = t r(cid:16)ev w ev aev aev (ab)k(cid:17) ,
h k = t r(cid:16)ev w ev w 2aev aev (ab)k(cid:17) ,

it must be noted that gk coincides with o1nk
n = 1. moreover, dk coincides with the operator o2nk



for n = 1 and h k coincides with o2nk

for



for n = 1 and k = 0.



inspection of the above list shows that these families are the lowest dimensional opera-
tors of a given structure, with building blocks given by w, a, a, b and b. it should also
be stressed that, although these operators have given quantum numbers of su(2)su(2),
and of su(2, 2|1) e0, s1, s2, r, we have not discussed the most general form of these op-
erators due to further mixing in terms of the constituent singleton elds w, a, b. for
instance, we have not written terms involving da or db, which certainly occur in the
completion of some of the above operators (for example the ones including j k
  which
contain both w w  and da d  a (or a  b)).

we would like to nally remark that there are many more operators in the gauge theory
which do not correspond to any supergravity kk mode, even though these multiplets may
have spin less than two. a typical example is the konishi (massive vector) supereld [36]

k = t r(aev aev ) + t r(bev bev )

(4.47)

with r = 0 and in the gsinglet j = l = 0.

this supereld has anomalous dimension [37]. however, inspection of the supergravity
spectrum, shows that the only multiplet with j = l = 0 must have rational dimension and
indeed it was identied with qk=0 in (3.45): qk=0 = t r(w 2ev w 2ev ), with e0 = 6.

this state of aair is resolved by the fact that k is expected to have a divergent
dimension  in the large nlimit, as presumably happens in the n = 4 theory so that it
should correspond to a string state.

the konishi multiplet [36] is a long multiplet whose d2 is a chiral supereld which
is a linear combination of the superpotential w = ijklt r(aibkajbl) and t r(w w).

31

this implies that neither w nor t r(w w) are chiral primaries but rather a combination
orthogonal to d dk. it is the latter supereld which appears in the supergravity spectrum
and coincides with the chiral dilaton multiplet k with k = 0.

this is an example of operator mixing alluded before.

appendix a: notations and conventions

consider ads5  t 11. we call m, n the curved tendimensional indices, , /m, n the
curved/at ads5 ones and /a, b the curved/at t 11 ones. in the four dimensional cft
, . . . and , . . . are spinorial indices.

our tendimensional metric is the mostly minus  = {+ . . .}, so that the internal
space has a negative denite metric. for ease of construction, we have also used a negative
metric to raise and lower the su(2)  su(2) liealgebra indices.
