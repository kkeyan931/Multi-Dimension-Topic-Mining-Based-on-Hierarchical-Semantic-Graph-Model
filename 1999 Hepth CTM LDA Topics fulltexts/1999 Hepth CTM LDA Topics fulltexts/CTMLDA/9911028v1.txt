abstract

we study the question of the ward identity for large gauge invariance in 0 + 1 dimensional
theories. we derive the relevant ward identities for a single avor fermion and a single avor
complex scalar eld interacting with an abelian gauge eld. these identities are nonlinear. the
ward identity for any other complicated theory can be derived from these basic sets of identities.
however, the structure of the ward identity changes since these are nonlinear identities.
in
particular, we work out the large gauge ward identity for a supersymmetric theory involving
a single avor of fermion as well as a complex scalar eld. contrary to the eective action for
the individual theories, the solution of the ward identity in the supersymmetric theory involves
an innity of fourier component modes. we comment on which features of this analysis are
likely/unlikely to generalize to the 2 + 1 dimensional theory.

introduction:

the question of large gauge invariance at nite temperature has been a very interesting one for
several years now [1]. it is well known that the chern-simons action in an odd dimensional non-
abelian gauge theory is not invariant under large gauge transformations [2]. rather, it shifts
by a constant proportional to the topological winding number associated with the large gauge
transformation. to be specic, consider the three dimensional chern-simons action

scs = mz d3x tr  a( a +

2g
3

a a)

(1)

where a is a matrix valued gauge eld in some representation of the gauge algebra. then, under
a gauge transformation a  u 1au + 1

g u 1u the chern-simons action changes as

scs  scs 

4m
g2  2w

where w is the winding number of the gauge transformation dened to be

w =

1

242 z d3x tr  u u 1 u u 1u u 1

(2)

(3)

the winding number is a topological number (integer) and unless the gauge transformation belongs
to the trivial topology class, it is clear that the chern-simons action will not be gauge invariant.
however, if the coecient of the chern-simons term is quantized in units of g2
4 , then the path
integral, which involves exp(iscs), will be invariant and we can dene a consistent quantum theory
[2].

chern-simons actions can be induced radiatively, with a perturbatively calculable coecient.
for example, for massive fermions interacting with a gauge eld at zero temperature, radiative
corrections due to the fermions induce a chern-simons term with a coecient 1
4 for
every avor) [3]. taking into account the intrinsic global anomaly [4], the eective action is in fact
invariant. alternatively, we can simply consider an even number of fermion avors.

2 (in units of g2

these radiative corrections at nite temperature are even more interesting. at one loop, in the
static limit, they induce a chern-simons term with a temperature dependent coecient [5] such
that

(4)

where  is the inverse temperature (in units of the boltzmann constant). this is now a continuous
function of temperature and, consequently, it can no longer be quantized in units of g2
4 even for an
even number of fermion avors. it would appear, therefore, that large gauge invariance would
be lost at nite temperature which is quite mysterious since gauge invariance has no direct relation
with temperature.

2

an interesting possible resolution to this puzzle comes from a study of the chern-simons theory
in 0 + 1 dimensions [6] which has all the features of the 2 + 1 dimensional theory and yet is much
simpler so that the theory can be exactly solved. it was observed there that, at nite temperature,
the radiative corrections give rise to an innite number of non-extensive terms besides the induced
chern-simons term and that the eective action due to radiative corrections can be exactly summed
in a closed form. this has to be contrasted with the case at zero temperature, where the only
nontrivial radiative correction was the chern-simons term. furthermore, it was observed that
the summed eective action at nite temperature is invariant under large gauge transformations
once the tree level coecient is quantized and we have an even number of fermion avors. this is,
indeed, quite interesting since it points out that even when the chern-simons term itself may violate
large gauge invariance, there may be other terms in the eective action which can compensate
to make the total eective action gauge invariant.

this mechanism extends [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] to 2+1 dimensional abelian theories for a restricted
class of static backgrounds a = (a0(t), ~a(~x)). however, this is not the full answer, since for these
backgrounds (and for their trivial non-abelian generalizations) the large gauge transformations in
fact have zero winding number - the shift in the chern-simons actions comes from a total derivative
term, not from the winding number piece. furthermore, such backgrounds only address the static
limit, while the non-static limit is known to be very dierent [13, 14]. of course, calculations
are more dicult in the 2 + 1 dimensional theory and one does not expect to be able to sum all
the terms in the eective action of this theory. therefore, to study the problem of large gauge
invariance in this theory, we must develop a systematic procedure. the natural idea, of course,
would be to write a ward identity for large gauge invariance, which relates dierent amplitudes
and, therefore, can be perturbatively checked even if the complete eective action is dicult to
evaluate. it is with this in mind that we have chosen to study the question of the ward identity
for large gauge transformations in the 0 + 1 dimensions. clearly, the derivation of the ward
identity for gauge transformations which are topologically nontrivial is hard, but, at least, in 0 + 1
dimensions, we have the exact eective actions in closed forms and, therefore, such theories provide
a natural starting point.
in section 2, we
recapitulate briey all the relevant facts known from the studies in the 0 + 1 dimensional theories.
in section 3, we try to derive the relevant ward identity for a single avor fermion theory from the
eective action, directly by brute force. as we will show, this is quite hard since the ward identities
are extremely nonlinear. an alternate method is to look at the ward identities in terms of the
exponential of the eective action which we do in section 4. these identities are linear and easier
to handle. (of course, the nonlinearity creeps in when we transform back to the eective action.)
the nonlinearity of these identities brings in many interesting features which we are not used to.
thus, for example, unlike the ward identities for small gauge invariance, here the identities do not
obey superposition. consequently, if a theory has two distinct sectors, the sum of the eective
action coming from the two sectors does not have the same structure of the identity as satised
by the individual contributions. we point out all such features and present a brief conclusion in
section 5 pointing out which features are likely/unlikely to extend to the 2 + 1 dimensional theory.

in this paper, we carry out such a study in detail.

2 recapitulation of results:

we rst recapitulate all the relevant results known from studies in 0 + 1 dimensional theories.
recall that the theory of massive fermions with nf avors interacting with an abelian gauge eld
including a chern-simons term is described by the action (we assume m > 0 for simplicity.)

sfermion = z dt (it  m  a)  z dt a

(5)

where we have suppressed the avor index for the fermions and we note that the last term is the
chern-simons term in 0 + 1 dimension. it is worth emphasizing that even though the gauge eld
here is abelian, this theory has all the properties of a 2 + 1 dimensional non-abelian theory. under
a gauge transformation,   ei , a  a+t, the fermion action is invariant, but the complete
action changes:

sfermion  sfermion   2n

(6)

where n is the appropriate winding number and it is clear that the tree level coecient  of the
chern-simons term must be quantized for the theory to be consistent. the mass term for the
fermion breaks charge conjugation invariance and, consequently, the radiative corrections due to
the fermions generate a chern-simons term at nite temperature modifying the coecient as

   

nf
2

tanh

m
2

(7)

this is analogous to the behavior in the 2 + 1 dimensional theory. in particular, we note that, at
zero temperature (  ) with an even number of avors, this is compatible with the quantization
of the coecient of chern-simons term, but it poses a problem at nite temperature suggesting
that gauge invariancce may be violated if the temperature is nonzero.

in this case, of course, the eective action can be exactly evaluated and has the form [6, 15]

(nf )

where we have dened (we have normalized the eective action so that it vanishes for a = 0.)

a = z dt a(t)

(8)

(9)

there are several things to note from the form of this eective action. first, this is a non-extensive
action (involves powers of an integrated quantity). non-extensive actions do not arise at zero
temperature from requirements of locality, but locality is not necessarily respected at nite tem-
perature. in fact, it is easily seen from small gauge invariance that, in this theory, if higher order
terms do not vanish, the eective action must be non-extensive. for example, let us note [15] that

4

if we have a quadratic term in the eective action, of the form sq = 1
then invariance under small gauge transformations would require

2 r dt1 dt2 a(t1)f (t1 t2)a(t2),

sq = z dt1 dt2 t1f (t1  t2)a(t2) = z dt1 dt2 t1f (t1  t2)a(t2) = 0

(10)

whose general solution is f = constant. if the constant is nonzero, the quadratic action becomes
non-extensive (a quadratic function of a). thus, one of the important features of this theory is
and, therefore,  is a function of a. this simple feature is unlikely to generalize to the
that 
2 + 1 dimensional theory. in fact, it is already known [16] that this does not hold even in 1 + 1
dimensions because the ward identities for small gauge invariance are not restrictive enough.

(nf )
f

another feature to note is that, under a large gauge transformation, for which

a  a + 2n,

the eective action coming from the radiative corrections due to the fermions transforms as



(nf )
f

(a)  

(nf )
f

(a + 2n ) = 

(nf )
f

(a) + nf n

(11)

(12)

so that the theory continues to be well dened for an even number of fermion avors. that is,
even though the coecient of the chern-simons term is no longer quantized at nite temperature,
the noninvariance of this term is completely compensated for by all the higher order terms in
the eective action. in fact, the most important thing to observe in this connection is that the
inhomogeneous transformation of the fermion eective action is independent of temperature, as we
should expect since gauge transformations are not related to temperature.

in 0 + 1 dimensions, we also know the results for the eective action of a massive, complex

scalar eld interacting with the abelian gauge eld [17]. consider the theory with action

sscalar = z dt (cid:16)(t  ia) (t + ia)  m2(cid:17)  z dt a

(13)

where, we have again suppressed the number of avors for simplicity. the mass term in this theory
does not break parity and, consequently, there is no chern-simons term generated. in fact, at zero
temperature, the radiative corrections due to the scalar elds identically vanishes which follows from
a combination of invariance under small gauge transformation and the absence of parity violation.
nonetheless, at nite temperature, the eective action coming from the scalar elds is nontrivial
and has the form

(14)

we see that even though there is no chern-simons term, we would have run into the problem of
large gauge invariance had we done a perturbative calculation and looked at the quadratic terms

5

alone. the eective action, once again, is non-extensive and is a function of a, namely, s = s(a).
furthermore, under a large gauge transformation,

namely, the action is invariant independent of the temperature.

finally, consider a simple supersymmetric model in 0 + 1 dimensions, with action [17]

here, in addition to the usual scalar and fermionic elds with identical number of avors, we also
have a stuckelberg multiplet of elds. the eective action for this theory is quite simple

and the transformation properties follow from our earlier discussion. with these basics, we are now
ready to get into the question of the ward identity for large gauge invariance.

3 ward identity (hard way):

to begin with, let us consider the model for a single (avor) massive fermion interacting with an
abelian gauge eld. the lagrangian is trivially obtained from eq. (5). let us denote by (1)
the
f
eective action which results from integrating out the fermions. from the general arguments of the
last section, we know that this eective action will be a function of a such that under a large gauge
transformation

f (a)  (1)

the taylor expansion of this relation gives

f (a + 2n ) = (1)

n+m(1)
f

= n

= 0 for m > 0

(21)

solving this set of equations is tedious, but with a little bit of work, we can determine that the
simplest relation which will satisfy the innity of relations has the form (this is, however, not the
most general relation as we will discuss later in the case of the supersymmetric theory.)

this relation (as well as the ones following from it) can be checked explicitly for the rst few low
order amplitudes of the theory [15, 18] and, consequently, eq. (22) can be thought of as the ward
identity for large gauge invariance (or better yet, the master equation from which all the relevant
relations can be obtained by taking further derivatives with respect to a). this relates higher point
functions to lower ones as we would expect a ward identity to do and must hold at zero as well
as nonzero temperature. however, unlike conventional ward identities associated with small gauge
invariance, we note that this relation is nonlinear. in some sense, this is to be expected for large
gauge transformations and we comment on the consequences of this feature later.

we note from the explicit form of the eective action determined earlier (see eq. (8) for nf = 1)
that eq. (22) indeed holds for the single avor fermion theory. let us also note here that all the
higher point functions can be determined from the ward identity in eq. (22) in terms of the one
point function which has to be calculated from the theory and is known to be [15, 18]

(23)

a (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a=0

it follows from this (using the identity in eq. (22)) that, at zero temperature, the two point and
all other higher point functions vanish. in fact, from the ward identity (22), we can determine the
form of the eective action to be (recall that f (a = 0) = 0)

namely, the eective action can be completely determined from the knowledge of the one point
function which, of course, coincides with the exact calculations. it is clear, however, that this way
of deriving the ward identity is extremely hard and, in particular, if the theory is complicated
(remember that so far we have only considered a single avor of massive fermion), then, it may be
much more dicult to determine the ward identity.

(22)

(24)

4 simple derivation of the ward identity:

to nd a simpler way of deriving the large gauge ward identity, let us dene

(a) = i log w (a)

(25)

where the upper sign is for a fermion theory while the lower one corresponds to a scalar theory.
namely, we are interested in looking at the exponential of the eective action (i.e. up to a factor of
i, w is the basic determinant that would arise from integrating out a particular eld). once again,
we will restrict ourselves to a single avor massive fermion or a single avor massive complex scalar
since any other theory can be obtained from these basic components. the advantage of studying
w (a) as opposed to the eective action lies in the fact that, in order for (a) to have the right
transformation properties under a large gauge transformation (see eqs. (12),(14)), w (a) simply
has to be quasi-periodic. consequently, from the study of harmonic oscillator (as well as floquet
theory), we see that w (a) has to satisfy a simple equation of the form

2w (a)
a2 + 2 w (a) = g

(26)

where  and g are parameters to be determined from the theory. in particular, let us note that
the constant g can depend on parameters of the theory such as temperature whereas we expect
the parameter , also known as the characteristic exponent, to be independent of temperature and
equal to an odd half integer for a fermionic mode or an integer for a scalar mode. however, all
these properties should automatically result from the structure of the theory. let us also note here
that the relation (26) is simply the equation for a forced oscillator whose solution has the general
form

w (a) =

g
2 + a cos(a + ) =

g
2 + 1 cos a + 2 sin a

(27)

the constants 1 and 2 appearing in the solution can again be determined from the theory.
namely, from the relation between w (a) and (a), we recognize that we can identify

21 = 

w

2w

a2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a=0

2 =

= i

 i

2

a2!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a=0

(28)

from the general properties of the scalar and fermion theories we have discussed, we intuitively
expect gf = 0 and 2,s = 0. however, these should really follow from the structure of the theory
and they do, as we will show shortly.

the identity (26) is a linear relation as opposed to the ward identity (22) in terms of the
eective action, and holds both for a fermionic as well as a scalar mode. in fact, rewriting this in
terms of the eective action (using eq. (25)), we have

2(a)

a2 = i 2 (cid:18) (a)

a (cid:19)2!  ig ei(a)

(29)

8

this is reminiscent of the identity in eq. (22), but is not identical. so, let us investigate this a little
bit more in detail, rst for a fermionic mode. in this case, we know that the fermion mass term
breaks parity and, consequently, the radiative corrections would generate a chern-simons term,
namely, in this theory, we expect the one-point function to be nonzero. consequently, by taking
derivative of eq. (29) (as well as remembering that (a = 0) = 0), we determine

this is quite interesting, for it says that the two parameters in eq. (26) or (29) can be determined
from a perturbative calculation. let us note here some of the perturbative results in this theory
[15, 18], namely,

a3 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a=0

3(1)

using these, we immediately determine from eq. (30) that

((1)

f )2 =

g(1)
f = 0

so that the equation (29) coincides with (22) for a single fermion avor. furthermore, we determine
now from eq. (28)

(1)
1,f = 1,

(1)
2,f = i tanh

(33)

the two signs in of (1)

can solve for w (a) in the single avor fermion theory and we have (independent of the sign of (1)

(34)

which can be compared with eq. (8).

for a scalar theory, however, we know that the mass term does not break parity. consequently,
we do not expect a chern-simons term to be generated simply from symmetry arguments. in fact,

9

in the scalar theory with parity as a symmetry, there cannot be any odd terms (in a) in the eective
action. consequently, taking derivatives of eq. (29) and keeping this in mind, we obtain

once again, we see that the two parameters in the ward identity can be determined from the rst
two nontrivial amplitudes of the theory. for the scalar theory, the necessary nontrivial amplitudes
can be easily computed [17]. (calculationally, the scalar theory coincides with two fermionic theories
with masses of opposite sign if we neglect the negative sign associated with fermion loops. the
amplitudes can also be determined from the explicit form of the eective action in eq. (14).)

it follows from this that

this can be compared with eq. (14).

thus, we see that the ward identities for the single avor fermion and scalar theories are given,

in terms of the eective actions, respectively by

as we have already pointed out, these are nonlinear identities and, therefore, superposition does
not hold. in fact, even if we are considering only fermions (or scalars) of nf avors, the identity

incidentally, let us note that although the ward identity is linear in w (a), for nf avors w (nf ) is
a product of w (1)s, not a sum, and so superposition is lost.

it is clear, therefore, that while the ward identity is simple for the basic fermion and scalar
modes, for arbitrary combinations of these modes, the identity is bound to be much more compli-
cated. however, we can still derive the ward identity from the basic identities for a single avor
fermion and scalar theory. thus, as a simple example, let us consider the supersymmetric theory
discussed in section 2 (see eq. (16-18)) for a single avor. in this case, we have simply a sum of a
fermionic and a complex bosonic degree of freedom, and dening

we see that we can no longer write a single identity for w (1)

this is very dierent from eq. (22) and yet satises the innite set of constraints in eq. (21). (let
us note here that the invariance properties of (1)
susy(a) is the same as that for a single avor fermion
theory.) thus, as we had mentioned earlier, the identity for a basic single avor theory is simpler.
the identities following from eq. (44) can be perturbatively checked. in fact, the identity can even
be solved in the following way. consider eq. (44). using the method of fourier decomposition, it

it is interesting that even for this simple model, which contains just a single avor of fermion and a
complex scalar, w (a) becomes a sum over innitely many distinct fourier modes as opposed to the
case of either a single fermion or a single complex scalar where w (a) involves only a single fourier
component. let us note here that, although w (1)
susy(a) in eq. (45) appears dierent from that in
eq. (18), the series in (45) can, in fact, be summed [19] and coincides with the result in (18) for a
single avor.

5 conclusion:

in this paper, we have systematically studied the question of large gauge invariance, in the
0 + 1 dimensional chern-simons theory. the eective actions, in 0 + 1 dimensions, are functions

of a = r dta(t) which is a consequence of ward identities for small gauge invariance and makes

the derivation of the large gauge identities relatively simple. this is a feature that we do not
expect to generalize to 2 + 1 dimensions, except for special static backgrounds. explicitly, we have
derived the large gauge ward identities for a single avor fermion theory as well as a single avor
complex scalar theory interacting with an abelian gauge eld. these identities are simple, but
nonlinear. the ward identity for any other theory can be derived from them and is, in general,
more complicated because of the nonlinear nature of the identities. in particular, we have shown
that the solutions of the ward identity for a single avor fermion theory or a single avor complex
scalar theory involves a single characteristic index and is simple while for a more complex theory
(even for a sum of just a single fermion and a single scalar), it involves a sum over an innity of
fourier modes. this is a feature which we believe would generalize to 2 + 1 dimensions.
