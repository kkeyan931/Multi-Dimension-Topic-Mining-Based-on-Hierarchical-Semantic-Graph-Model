ical eld theory with kahler structure.

introduction

historically the cohomological eld theory rst has been introduced as a twisted
version of global space-time supersymmetric quantum eld theory, specically
the n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four dimensional space-time [1].
the global space-time supersymmetry, by denition, requires the existence of a
spinor which is constant everywhere on the space-time manifold m . a spinor
does exist on a spin manifold. a spin manifold, however, rarely admits a con-
stant spinor. the canonical way overcoming the above diculty is localizing the
supersymmetry, which procedure almost magically introduces (super-)gravity
into the picture.

there is a second option called twisting, meaning that one denes a new
lorentz symmetry group by a suitable combination of the original lorentz sym-
metry with an internal global symmetry of the theory. as a result, the super-
charges transform dierently under the new lorentz symmetry, which typically
includes some components which transform as scalars. such a scalar component
q, which is nilpotent q2 = 0, is regarded as a supercharge of the twisted theory.
the resulting theory is well-dened on an arbitrary space-time since there are
no global obstruction for a scalar and enjoys general covariance without grav-
ity. the path integral of the theory depends only on the global cohomology of
q, provided that one uses q-invariant observables, which property coined the
adjective cohomological [2].

a twisted theory is closely related to the underlying space-time supersym-
metric theory. namely the path integral of the twisted theory computes a certain
chiral (or bps) sector of physical amplitudes [3][4]. this is due to the trivial
holonomy of at space-time where the physical theory is usually dened. then

twisting is a physically invisible operation. the typical physical application of
a twisted theory is a non-perturbative test of certain duality utilizing the semi-
classical exactness of the path integral. two famous examples are given by
mirror symmetry [5][6] and the s-duality of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory in four-dimensions [7]. the twisted version of four dimensional n = 2
supersymmetric yang-mills theory - the donaldson-witten theory [1][8], also
provided crucial hints [9][10] on the celebrated seiberg-witten solutions of the
original n = 2 theory [11].1

in general we may forget about the underlying physical origin of a coho-
mological eld theory and dene the theory as a quantum eld theory with
global fermionic symmetry. such a theory may not be directly obtainable as a
twisted version of underlying space-time supersymmetric theory. the most fun-
damental property of a quantum eld theory with global fermionic symmetry
is the xed point theorem of witten [3][13]. almost all the other properties of
cohomological eld theory can be obtained as certain a lemma of the theorem.
in this paper we develop a general approach which identies any cohomolog-
ical eld theory with 0 + 0-dimensional supersymmetric sigma model. being in
zero-dimensions the (space-time) supersymmetry simply means global fermionic
symmetry. the target space of our sigma-model may be some function space
x in the theorem quoted above. such a space may be any (non-linear or linear
and nite or innite dimensional) endowed with any of

riemannian  kahler  hyper-kahler

(1.1)

c , n 

c ) of global supercharges, where we have n +

structures. actually the above structures may not be regarded as a priori no-
tions. the cohomological eld theory can be classied by the number nc =
(n +
independent mutu-
ally nilpotent fermionic charges and n 
c denote the number of charges carrying
fermionic (or ghost) numbers 1. then we have the following sequence of
fermionic symmetries

c + n 
c

n +

c = 1  n +

c = 2  n +

c = 4,

(1.2)

which determine the sequence of geometrical structures (1.1).2

in this paper we specialize to models with a kahler structure. those models
are quite general and allow us to have very compact formulations. the initial
1 we must stress here that solutions of the underlying physical theory provides us with
invaluable insights in the mathematical problem dened by the twisted theory. perhaps one
of the most beautiful properties of quantum eld theory is that the theory depends on a
scale. the equally beautiful property of cohomological eld theory is that the theory does
not depends on a scale. thus the mathematical problem dened by the latter theory can be
solved in terms of the former theory in dierent scale where its relevant degrees of freedom
is, often, completely dierent from the original microscopic ones. the historical example is,
of course, the donaldson versus seiberg-witten invariant [12].

2 the above correspondence is originally due to supersymmetric sigma models in two-
dimensions [14][15][16]. in certain respects, such a correspondence in zero-dimensional mod-
els is more striking since we do not need any underlying geometrical objects like the two-
dimensional space-time. actually the sequence (1.2) leads to more general geometrical struc-
tures including torsion [17]. however, the author is not aware of any examples of traditional
cohomological eld theory with torsion in the space of elds.

data will be some function space x endowed with a complex structure compat-
ible with the supersymmetry. then most of the other structures of the models
can be xed. we will introduce three types of models, two with nc = (2, 0)
and one with nc = (2, 2) symmetry, and establish general interrelations. for
each type we will consider non-linear x and linear or non-linear x with a group
g acting on x. in due course the relation between our construction and two-
dimensional supersymmetric eld theory will become obvious. this opens up
possibilities of stringy generalizations of those dierential-topological invariants
dened by cohomological eld theory. this chapter may be also viewed, after
slight modications, as an unorthodox introduction to two-dimensional super-
symmetric eld theories. our presentation for models with a group action will
parallel the original literature on nws = (2, 2) and nws = (2, 0) gauged linear
sigma-models in two dimensions [18][19]. we should also mention the inuential
paper of witten on supersymmetry and morse theory [20] dealing with (0 + 1)-
dimensional supersymmetric sigma models, which can be regarded as the origin
of cohomological eld theory.3

perhaps our denition for cohomological eld theory as a zero dimensional
sigma model might be confusing. if the target space x is the function space of
certain elds on a manifold m we have a traditional cohomological eld theory
on m . as some general literature for cohomological eld theory we refer to [2]
and [21] for short but lucid introductions. we refer to [22] for a general reference
for the riemannian version of nc = (2, 0) models. for the riemannian version
of nc = (2, 2) model, called balanced cohomological eld theory, we refer to
[23]. for a mathematician the path integral of a cohomological eld theory
is mathai-quillen formalism of integral representation of thom class [24][21].
though we will never refer to mathai and quillen, our (path) integral formula
can be viewed as kahler version of mathai-quillen formalism. more precisely
our formua should be viewed as a certain equivariant generalization of fulton
and macpersons intersection theory [25]. for a physicist a cohomological eld
theory a supersymmetric gauged sigma model in (0 + 0)-dimensions. though we
will never use the superspace formalism our construction is equivalent to n = 2
superspace formalism.

the most fundamental property of a quantum eld theory with a global
fermionic symmetry is the xed point theorem of witten. almost all the other
properties of cohomological eld theory can be obtained as a certain lemma of
the theorem. we refer to the original references [3][13] for this crucial theorem.

standard models of cohomological field the-
ory

this and the next chapters are devoted to an elementary and self-contained
introduction to cohomological eld theory. though elementary, we will develop

3it is ironical since his construction can be regarded as, in our viewpoints, a generalized

cohomological eld theory.

3

the most general construction of cohomological eld theory involving kahler
geometry.

in this chapter we consider supersymmetric sigma models in (0 + 0) dimen-
sions, whose target space is a compact complex kahler manifold x. those
models may be regarded as the quantum theory of single point-like instanton
- the point-like event of x or point-like instanton probes of the classical geom-
etry of x by means of the path integral. the space of all bosonic eld will be
the conguration space of the instanton, which is a copy of the manifold x.
we will start from the simplest nc = (2, 0) model as a toy model. a slightly
more complicated nc = (2, 2) model follows. then we generalize it to another
nc = (2, 0) model. we will survey how those supersymmetric theories probe or
give rise to the classical geometry of kahler manifolds x, its tangent bundle t x
and holomorphic hermitian vector bundle e over x. the models to be covered
here will be used as the prototypes of all the other more elaborated models to
be introduced later. we refer to the models in this chapter as standard models
since any cohomological eld theory will reproduce to one of those models if it
is generic.

we follow a typical procedure of dening supersymmetric eld theory, namely
introducing bosonic elds, supercharges with their algebra, fermionic superpart-
ners, supersymmetric action functional, and studying path integrals. due to the
triviality of the model everything can be made completely rigorous. assuming
existence of nil-potent supercharges, a simple application of poincare lemma
leads to an appropriate supersymmetric action functional. all the other geo-
metrical structures then naturally follow. we will also clarify the geometrical
meaning of the supercharges.

2.1 a toy model

in this section we design perhaps the simplest path integral, which has many of
the basic properties of cohomological eld theory.

consider a compact complex n-dimensional space x . we pick local co-
ordinates xi , i = 1, . . . , 2n on x. the local complex coordinates on x will
be denoted as zi, i = 1, . . . , n; their complex conjugates are zi = zi. let x i
be local coordinates elds describing the position of an instanton on x. more
precisely, the x i parameterize a map

x i : point  x.

(2.1)

we denote by x i local complex coordinates elds and x i be their complex
conjugates. we call x i and x i bosonic elds. we introduce anti-commuting
operators s and s called supercharges satisfying the following anti-commutation
relations,

s2 = 0,

{s, s} = 0,

s2 = 0.

(2.2)

we dene a pair of graded quantum number (ghost numbers) (p, q) such that s
and s carry the following ghost numbers

s : (1, 0),

s : (0, 1).

(2.3)

4

we call the supersymmetry (2.2) of type nc = (2, 0), meaning that we have two
supercharges both carrying positive ghost numbers.

we assume that the x i are holomorphic elds, meaning that sx i = 0,
and their complex conjugate x i are anti-holomorphic, sx i = 0. then we can
postulate the following supersymmetry transformation laws

sx i = ii,
sx i = 0,

sx i = 0,

sx i = ii,

si = 0,
si = 0,

si = 0,

si = 0.

from the above we may write s and s as follows

s = ii 

x i ,

s = ii 
x i

.

(2.4)

(2.5)

we call the anti-commuting superpartners i and i of x i and x i, respectively,
fermionic elds. they carry the ghost numbers (1, 0) and (0, 1), respectively.
in general, a eld with ghost number (p, q) is fermionic if p + q is odd while,
otherwise, it is bosonic.

now we consider an action functional s(x i, x i, i, i) which is invariant
under both of thesupersymmetries with supercharges s and s. the conditions
for supersymmetry ss = ss = 0 together with the anti-commutation relations
(2.2) imply, due to the poincare lemma, that s may be written as

s = issk(x i, x i),

(2.6)

where k is a locally dened real functional of x i and x i. applying the trans-
formation laws (2.4) we have

s = i(cid:18) 2k

x ix j(cid:19) ij := ikijij.

(2.7)

now we consider the feynman path integral of our model. the partition

function is dened as integration over the space of all elds weighted by es,

z =z [dxdxdd] es.

(2.8)

in everyday quantum eld theory, we usually do not have a well-dened path
integral measure though we have well-established rules of doing the path integral
at least for the perturbative regime. for our trivial quantum eld theory the
path integral measure is perfectly well-dened. the space of all bosonic elds
is a copy of x. thus the path integral is an integral over x. we have

z =zx

nyk,k=1

dx kdx kdkdk exp(cid:16)ikij ij(cid:17) .

(2.9)

5

remark that the path integral measure carries ghost number (n, n), i.e., the
ghost number anomaly. in the above evaluation we used the basic fact of inte-
gration over grassmann numbers that the integrand should also carry the net
ghost number (n, n) to have a non-vanishing integral. performing the integral
over i and i, using the law of integral over grassmannian number, we have

z =zx

nyk,k=1

dx kdx kdet(ikij).

(2.10)

now we compare the properties of our model with the dierential geometry
of the kahler manifold x. we denote the space of r-forms on x by r(x). we
have the exterior derivative

d : r(x)  r+1(x)

satisfying d2 = 0. for any complex manifold we have decompositions

r(x) = mr=p+q

p,q(x)

of r-forms into type (p, q)-forms with p + q = r. similarly we have a decompo-
sition d =  +  such that

 : p,q(x)  p+1,q(x),

 : p,q(x)  p+1,q(x),

(2.11)

and

2 = 0,

{, } = 0,

2



= 0.

in terms of the local complex coordinates zi and zi we have

 = dzi 

zi ,

 = dzi 
zi

.

(2.12)

(2.13)

a complex manifold is kahler i there exists a non-degenerated type (1, 1)-form
 satisfying d = 0. a basic fact of the kahler geometry is that the kahler
metric tensor gij can be written as

gij =

2f

zizj

,

where f is a kahler potential. the kahler form  is given by

 = ijdzi  dzj = igijdzi  dzj,

(2.14)

(2.15)

where ij = ji while gij = gji.

a comparison with our supersymmetric theory leads to the following obvious

dictionary

zi  x i,

zi  x i,

dzi  ii,

dzi  ii.

6

(2.16)

under the above isomorphism the relations (2.12) and (2.13) become (2.2) and
(2.5), respectively, such that

  s,

  s.

(2.17)

also the kahler form  in (2.15), after identifying k with a kahler potential f
of x, i.e., kij = gij, becomes (minus) our action functional s in (2.7). now we
examine the partition function z dened by (2.9). it is obvious that, compare
with (2.10)

z =zx

e =zx

n
n!

=zx

nyk,k=1

dzkdzkdet(igij),

(2.18)

where the second identity follows from the fact that the integrand should be
a top form and the third identity follows from the denition of . thus the
partition function of our rst supersymmetric eld theory is the symplectic
volume of x. we remark that the second identity is equivalent to the condition
of the ghost number anomaly cancellation.

one may formalize the above correspondence as follows. for the tangent

now we move on to observables and correlation functions. a supersymmetric

notes the parity change of the ber as in (2.16). then the supercharges s and

annihilated by supercharges. we consider the following polynomial function on

bundle t x we dene an associated superspace dt x where the hat symbol de-
s are odd vectors and the action s is a function on dt x.
observable b is a quantity invariant under the symmetry of the theory and
dt x,
carrying the ghost numbers (p, q). due to the isomorphism (2.16) sbp,q = 0 i

p,q = 0 where p,q  p,q(x) is the (p, q)-form on x dened by

bp,q = i1...ipj 1...jq

i1 . . . ip j 1 . . . jp,

(2.19)

p,q = i1...ipj 1...jq

dzi1  . . .  dzip  dzj1  . . .  dzjp.

(2.20)

note that s denes a dolbeault cohomology on the space of observables graded
by the ghost numbers which correspond to the form degrees.
in the above
we showed that the s cohomology is isomorphic to the dolbeault cohomology
(, ,(x)) on x.

the correlation function of observables or the expectation value is dened

by

rym=1bpm,qm  es.

(2.21)

(2.22)

p1,q2  . . .  pr ,qr  e.

for the present model we see that

* rym=1bpm,qm+ =z [dxdxdd]
* rym=1bpm,qm+ =zx

7

obviously we have non-vanishing correlation function if the observables satisfy
the ghost number anomaly cancellation condition

(pm, qm) = (, ),

  n

(2.23)

rxm=1
(n  )!zx

1

then

* rym=1bpm,qm+ =

p1,q2  . . .  pr ,qr    . . .  .

(2.24)

it follows that correlation functions of supersymmetric observables depend only
on the cohomology classes of observables and the kahler form .4 thus the
correlation function computes the classical cohomology ring of the target space
x. equivalently the correlation function computes intersection numbers of ho-
mology cycles dual to p,q  h p,q(x).

using our toy model we illustrated many of the basic properties of cohomo-
logical eld theory. in general, however, life is never as simple as in the idealized
world. typically we encounter an innite dimensional space of certain set of
elds on a manifold m as our target space x. furthermore there usually exists
an innite dimensional group action on the target space. nonetheless one is
eventually interested in the subspace dened as the solution space of certain
rst order dierential equations, modulo the gauge symmetry. thus we will
need a machinery to reduce the path integral to such a subspace and to take
care of the group action, as we will do later.

for the time being we ignore those things and assume that the path inte-
gral is eventually reduced to some nite dimensional moduli space. then it
may be equivalent to our toy model. we may call a quantum eld theory on
m with such a property a cohomological eld theory. usually the dierential
geometrical structures of the moduli space are induced from those of m . such
a eld theory on m has global supersymmetry equivalent to (0 + 0)-dimensional
supersymmetry. the cohomology of such a global supersymmetry is isomorphic
to a certain cohomology of m . consequently the correlation functions of su-
persymmetric observables are dierential topological invariant of m . we refer
to the original paper [1] of witten for a lucid exposition of general properties
of such a cohomological eld theory. here we repeated many of his arguments,
perhaps in a slightly dierent context.

2.2 nc = (2, 2) model

in this section we consider a somewhat more interesting model by generalizing
the toy model of the previous section. we introduce two copies (s, s) of the

poincare dual to . then the integral reduces to

4consider the integralrx
cohomology class as , i.e.,  =  + d. we have, using stokes theorem, r

fermionic charges (s, s). we regard the above doubling as a z2-grading in the
sense that supercharges carry the following ghost numbers (p, q) introduced for
the toy model,

s+ : (+1, 0),
s : (1, 0),

s+ : (0, +1),
s : (0, 1).

(2.25)

thus the supercharges s+ and s+ can be identied with the original super-
charges s and s of the toy model. we want to dene a supersymmetric theory
invariant under all four supercharges. obviously we will have a z2-symmetry
exchanging the + and  indices. we will say that the resulting theory is of
type nc = (2, 2). we will see that such a model is related with the geometry
of tangent bundle t x of a kahler manifold x. the partition function of this
model can be identied with the euler characteristic of x.

2.2.1 basic structures

we postulate that the supercharges satisfy the following anti-commutation re-
lations,

s2
 = 0,

{s, s} = 0,

s2
 = 0,

(2.26)

and

{s+, s} = 0,

{s, s} = 0,

{s+, s} = 0,

(2.27)

which is an obvious generalization of (2.2). we will consider the same bosonic
elds x i and x i as in our toy model. we demand x i to be bi-holomorphic or
chiral, meaning that sx i = 0.5 we call the complex conjugates x i anti-chiral,
meaning that s+x i = sx i = 0. now the anti-commutation relations among
supercharges suggest that we have the following chiral multiplets

i


s x i

s+ i
+

s+

s

.

(2.28)

h i

in the above h i are called auxiliary elds, which are introduced due to the
conditions

{s+, s}x i = is+i

 + isi

+ = 0,

(2.29)

can be solved as si = h i while they are indeterminate.6 denoting  =
s+ + s+ + s+ + s+ we have the following transformation laws for
5note that this choice is arbitrary. we may also demand twisted bi-holomorphicity or
twisted chirality by imposing s+x i = sx i = 0. a model with both chiral and twisted
chiral multiplets has very interesting properties.

6 the equation might also be solved as si = 0 without introducing h i. however, the
auxiliary elds are indispensable. the moral is that we better keep it whenever we encounter
redundancy.

(2.30)

now we dene a natural supersymmetric action functional. the require-
ments ss = ss = 0 for s to have nc = (2, 2) supersymmetry and the
anti-commutation relations (2.26) and (2.27) imply, by repeatedly applying the
poincare lemma, that we can write s as follows,

s = s+s+ssk(x i, x i),

(2.31)

where k(x i, x i) is a locally dened real functional. expanding the above we
have

s = gijh ih j + ikgij k

+i

h j + ikgij k

+h ij

 + kgij

(2.32)
= /x j and we set gij := ijk. we can integrate
where i = /x i and 
j
out the auxiliary elds h i and h i by a gaussian integral, or, equivalently,
eliminate them by pluging in the algebraic equations of motions for h i and h i;

h i = igijkgj k
h j = +igijkgi k

+
,
+
,

(2.33)

where gij is the inverse of gij. then we obtain the new action functional s,

s = rkij 

+k

+i

j
,

where

rkij = kgij + gpqigpkjgq,

(2.34)

(2.35)

which can be identied with the the riemann curvature tensor of t x if k is
a kahler potential of x. remark that the non-vanishing components of the
christoel symbols in the kahler geometry are

k = gijkgj,
i

i
k

= gijkgi.

(2.36)

the new action s is invariant under the supersymmetry after modifying the
transformation laws (2.30) by replacing h i and h i by their on-shell expressions
(2.33).

now we examine the path integral. the partition function is dened as

(2.37)
where the integration is over the space of all elds. the bosonic part of the path
integral is an integration over a copy of x. we rst perform the integral over i
+
j
and i

+ which, as we saw earlier, is equivalent to replacing rkij

by the (1, 1)-form r

integration over i

z =

det(r

e(t x) := (t x).

(2.39)

the last identity is due to the gauss-bonnet theorem. thus the partition func-
tion computes the euler characteristic (x) = (t x) of the manifold x.

2.2.2 geometrical interpretation of supercharges

now we examine the geometrical meaning of our supercharges. in sect. 2.1.1
we already saw that the supercharges s+ and s+ are associated with the  and
 dierential on the target space x. our task is to understand the geometrical
meaning of the remaining supercharges s and s.

we begin with discarding the obvious candidates for s and s, namely the

operators  and 



dened by

 =    : p,q(x)  p1,q(x),

=    : p,q(x)  p,q1(x),



(2.40)

where  denote the hodge star. they satisfy the following relations

2 = 0,



{, 

} = 0,

2



= 0,

(2.41)

and decrease the form degree by (1, 0) and (0, 1) , respectively. we have,
however, well-known relations in kahler geometry

{, } = {, 



} =

{d, d} =

1
2

,

(2.42)

11

where  is the laplacian. on the other hand we have {s+, s} = {s+, s} = 0.
we also have more obvious problem from x i = 0, while sx i = ii
 6= 0.
thus we have to seek an alternative set of operators.

we rst consider the real symplectic case and then specialize to the kahler
case. consider a symplectic manifold with symplectic form  = ij dxi  dxj .
since the matrix ij = ji is non-degenerated we have a well-dened inverse
matrix ji . using ji we have a canonical map from a cotangent vector to
xi for a cotangent vector

and its dual tangent vector, respectively, we have

a tangent vector.7 denoting  = i dxi and e = ei 

one may dene the corresponding operator  as follows

ei = ij j .
xi(cid:19)
(cid:18)

(dxj )





 :=

ij

2 (cid:18)(cid:18)



xj(cid:19) 

(dxi )(cid:19) ,

(2.43)

(2.44)

where the symbol  

xi means taking tensor product. for instance we have

 = ij l(cid:18)



xi(cid:19) (dxl)

(dxj )

= ij j

similarly  induce an isomorphism



xi =ei 

xi =e.

(2.45)

 : (pt x  qtx)  (p1t x  q+1tx),

(2.46)

where t x and t x are the tangent and cotangent vector, respectively, and 
denotes the space of sections. note that (pt x  qtx) = p(x, qtx).

now we can dene a rst order dierential operator by taking the composi-

tion of  and the exterior derivative d,

d : (pt x  qtx)  (p+1t x  qtx),

(2.47)

as follows,

ed := (d  d) : (pt x  qtx)  (pt x  q+1tx).

we will conveniently assign the form degree 1 to the operator ed. one can

thus for a symplectic manifold x with the symplectic form  we have

(xi , dxi , /xi; d,ed),

where dxi and /dxi denote local coordinates in the ber of t x and the ber
of t x, respectively. to relate with supersymmetry we perform the parity

now we return to a kahler manifold x with kahler form  = ijdzi  dzj
and show that the above interpretation is indeed the correct one. it is suce to

2.2.3 introducing a holomorphic potential

now we consider a more general action functional. we pick a holomorphic
function w(x i) of the chiral elds x i. since sx i = 0 we have sw(x i) = 0.
it follows that we have the following more general n = (2, 2) supersymmetric
action functional,

s() =s+s+ssk(x i, x i) + s+sw(x i) + s+sw(x i),

(2.64)

2.2.4 the partition function

the partition function is independent of  since  dependent term is s-exact
deformation of s. in the limit    the dominant contributions to the path
integral are from the vanishing locus of holomorphic vector elds vi. or we may
simply apply the xed point theorem of witten to reach the same conclusion;
from the supersymmetry transformation laws (2.30) we see that the xed point
equations are j
 = h i = 0. from the relations (2.41) the above implies vi = 0.
for generic choices the vanishing locus will be zero dimensional and consists
of isolated points. then there are no fermionic zero-modes and the action func-
tional evaluated at such a point is simply 0. thus the partition function is just
the sum of contributions of each point weighted by the one loop determinants
of the transverse degrees of freedom. due to the bose-fermi symmetry such a
determinant is 1, depending on a certain orientation, due to supersymmetry
and due to the ambiguity in taking the square root of the determinant. in our
case they always can be set +1 since the ambiguities from holomorphic and

15

anti-holomorphic contribution cancel each other. thus the partition function is
the number of zeros. if we turn o the potential we recover the original model.
this gives rise to the poincare-hopf theorem. we should mention that the usual
derivation of poincare-hopf theorem uses supersymmetric quantum mechanics,
i.e., the (0 + 1) dimensional sigma model [27][28][20], but with essentially the
same arguments.

for a non-generic vector eld vi the vanishing locus can be a positive dimen-
sional submanifold. one may try to perturb the vector eld vi, thus w(x i), to
a generic one or just evaluate the path integral. we will give a detailed analysis
for this case in the next section in a more general context.

2.3 generalization to nc = (2, 0) model

the model in the previous section enjoys a perfect symmetry between things
with + and  indices. now we want to relax such a symmetry. we shall
see that such symmetry is due to the restriction of considering a very special
hermitian holomorphic vector bundle, namely the tangent bundle t x, over x.
by maintaining only the nc = (2, 0) supersymmetry generated by s+ and s+ we
arrive at a more general model, which is related with a hermitian holomorphic
bundle e over x.

2.3.1 the basic structures

first we write our action functional s() (2.64) in form such that only the s+
and s+ are manifest,

s() = s+s+(cid:16)gij(x i, x i)i

j

(cid:17) + is+(cid:0)i

vi(x j)(cid:1) + is+(cid:16)i

vi(x j)(cid:17) .

(2.69)

similarly we disconnect the diagram (2.28) by removing the link s

i


x i

s+ i
+

s+

.

(2.70)

h i

now we can regard the above as two independent sets of multiplets. then we
rename various elds as follows

  
i
,
  
i
,

h i  h ,

h i  h ,

vi  s(x j),
vi  s(x j),

gij  h(x i, x i), (2.71)

where the new indices run as ,  = 1, . . . , r and we maintain the hermiticity
of h. the s+ and s+ transformation laws are

x i = ii
+,
x i = ii
+,

i

+ = 0,

i

+ = 0,

16

(2.72)

and




 = h ,
 = h ,

h  = 0,
h  = 0.

(2.73)

now we have following new action functional

s =  s+s+(cid:16)h(x i, x i)



(cid:17) + is+(cid:0)

s(x i)(cid:1) + is+(cid:16)

s(x i)(cid:17) ,

(2.74)

which is the general form of nc = (2, 0) supersymmetric action functional.

note that the above action functional may or may not have nc = (2, 2)
symmetry. generically the model does not have nc = (2, 2) supersymmetry.
note also that the model has the same supersymmetry as our toy model in sect.
2.1.1. thus the new model shares the same observables with the toy models,

which arebp,q obtained by an element p,q = h p,q(x) of the cohomology group
h p,q(x) after the parity change tx dtx. the dierences with the toy model

are that we have additional fermi multiplets (

as zero by treating the kahler form  as an observables. now we turn to
examine the action functional.

2.3.2 relations with hermitian holomorphic vector bundle

it turns out that we are describing a rank r hermitian holomorphic vector
bundle e  x over a kahler manifold x with hermitian structure h. here

17

we briey summarize some properties of hermitian holomorphic bundles [29].
consider a rank r complex vector bundle e over x. let p,q(x, e) denote
the space of (p, q)-forms over x with values in e. a connection (the covariant
derivative) da can be decomposed as

da = a + a : p,q(x, e)  p+1,q(x, e)  p,q+1(x, e).

(2.80)

a connection da endows e with a structure of a holomorphic vector bundle if the
2
(0, 2)-component f 0,2  2(x, end(e)) of its curvature f vanishes, i.e., 
a = 0.
a complex vector bundle e is hermitian if it has a xed hermitian structure h
which is a c eld of positive denite hermitian inner products in the bers of
e. given a local frame eld su = (s1, . . . , sr) of e over an open subset u  x
we set h = h(s, s) where ,  = 1, . . . , r. gluing them along dierent
coordinate patches as usual we obtain h(zi, zi). a connection d in (e, h) is
called an h-connection if d(h(, )) = h(d, ) + h(, d) for ,   0(e). the
theorem is that given a hermitian structure h in a holomorphic vector bundle e,
there is a unique h-connection da called hermitian connection such that a = .
finally the curvature two-form of a hermitian connection is of type (1, 1), thus
f 2,0 also vanishes. the curvature two-form is given by the formula

f := fij dzi  dzj,

(2.81)

where fij is dened as (2.78). we note that the kahler metric gij on x is a
hermitian structure of t x.

we saw that our model describes a rank r hermitian holomorphic vector
bundle e with hermitian structure h(zi, zi). now s can be identied with
a holomorphic section of e. in summary a nc = (2, 0) model is associated with
a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle (e, h) over a kahler manifold x with
holomorphic section. associated with the base manifold x we have holomorphic
multiplets (2.72), as in the toy model. associated with the ber space we have
fermi multiplets (2.73).

2.3.3 the path integrals

now we examine the path integral of our model in the various situations.

turning o the holomorphic section

to begin with we consider the case that s = 0. the partition function z

is dened by

z =z (cid:20) nyk,=1(cid:16)dx kdx kdk

+dk

+(cid:17) ry,=1(cid:16)d

d

(cid:17)(cid:21)exp(cid:16)fij i

+j

(2.82)
the bosonic integral is an integral over x. as before the bosonic integral and
integration over k
+ combine into the integration of dierential forms on

+ and k

+



(cid:17) .

18

x by replacing fiji
thus we have

+j

+ with the curvature two-form f dened in (2.81).

z =zx

ry,=1(cid:16)d

d

(cid:17) exp(cid:16)f



(cid:17) .

(2.83)

the fermionic integral of  and  leads to the paan of the curvature two-
form f  1,1(x, end(e). we immediately see that the integrand is not a
top form on x unless n = r. for n = r the partition function is the euler
character (e),

e(e) = (e),

(2.84)

z =zx

otherwise, for n 6= r, the path integral vanishes. in the case r < n we can insert

a set of observables qbp,q with the total ghost number (n  r, n  r) and

evaluate the correlation function

e(e)  p1,q1  . . .  pm,qm

(2.85)

* my=1bp,q+ =zx

the path integral always vanishes for r > n. we see that the vector bundle e
after the parity change can be viewed as a bundle spanned by anti-ghosts 

over x.

turning on the holomorphic section

now we turn on the holomorphic section s of e  x. applying the xed
point theorem of witten we see that the path integral is localized to an s+ and
s+ invariant neighborhood of the vanishing locus n of s(x i) in x, where
 = 1, . . . , r and i = 1, . . . , n. the condition s(x i) = 0 implies s+(s) = 0
in the s+ invariant neighborhood of n . we have

j sj

+ = 0.

(2.86)

we call a non-trivial solution above a zero-modes of +, which is a degree of
freedom tangent to the vanishing locus n . we call a non-trivial solution of the
similar equations

j s

 = 0

(2.87)

a zero-mode of . for a generic choice of section s the equation s = 0 cuts
out a (n  r) complex dimensional subspace of x. then the equation (2.86)
implies that we have exactly (n  r) zero-modes of +, while the equation (2.87)
implies that we do not have any zero-modes of , since n  r. assume that the
equations j s = 0, only for a xed  have common roots for all j = 1, . . . , n.
then (2.86) for the xed  do not impose any condition on the j
+ and we may
have (n  r + 1) zero-modes of +. similarly the equations (2.87) do not impose
any condition on the xed component 
 and we may have one zero-mode of
. thus we may draw two conclusions

19

1. for a generic choice of section we do not have any zero-modes of anti-
ghosts. the vanishing locus s1(0) of the section has the right complex
(n  r) dimensions and the zero-modes of + span the tangent space of
s1(0).

2. for a non-generic choice of section we may have anti-ghost zero-modes.
the vanishing locus s1(0) of the section have dimension higher than the
right one. in any cases we have

n  r = #(e+)  #(e)

where #( gf ermi) denotes the number of fermionic zero-modes. we call the

above the formal or virtual complex dimension of s1(0). the space of
anti-ghost zero-modes span a vector bundle v over s1(0) called the anti-
ghost bundle. the ber dimension of v may jump when s1(0) develops
singularities.
we also see that our action functional s (2.77) restricted to the s+ and
s+ invariant neighborhood c of the xed point locus is given by

(2.88)

(2.89)

s|c = f

where it is understood all the fermions (i

ture of the anti-ghost bundle v over s1(0).



+,ei
their zero-modes (ei
+,e

) are replaced by
 ) and the curvature above is the curva-

+, 

, 

 , 

now we examine the path integral. for n = r and with a generic section
the vanishing locus s1(0) is zero-dimensional and the path integral counts the
number of zeros of the section. for n = r and with a non-generic section the
zeros of the section can be a positive dimensional submanifold s1(0)  x of
x. the path integral reduces to an integral over s1(0) and over anti-ghost
zero-modes. note that the rank of the anti-ghost bundle v over s1(0) is the
same as the complex dimension of s1(0). the path integral becomes (v)

z =zs1(0)

e(v) = (v),

(2.90)

which in turn can be identied with (e).

now we consider the case r < n. the partition function still evaluates the
euler class e(v) of the anti-ghost bundle v over s1(0). since, by the formula
(2.88), the rank of v is smaller than the complex dimension of s1(0). thus
the euler class e(v) is not a top form and the partition function vanishes. to
get a non-trivial result we should insert a set of observables and evaluate the
expectation value

* my=1bp,q+ =zs1(0)

e(v)  p1,q1  . . .  pm,qm,

(2.91)

20

p =

q = n  r,

(2.92)

mx=1

mx=1

where

and otherwise the path integral vanishes. if there are no anti-ghost zero-modes
we have e(v) = 1 and the above correlation function reduces to the intersection
number of homology cycles poincare dual to p,q in s1(0). the selection rule
above can be understood in more physical terms. the path integral measure
contains a ghost number anomaly due to the fermionic zero-modes. the net
ghost number violation of the path integral measure is (n  r, n  r), which
follows from the formula (2.88) and the ghost numbers of the fermions;

i

+ : (1, 0),

i

+ : (0, 1),




 : (1, 0),
 : (0, 1).

(2.93)

to cancel the ghost number anomaly we have to insert observables according to
the selection rule (2.92) to soak up the fermion zero-modes in the path integral
measure.

specializing to nc = (2, 2) model

finally we consider a special case of nc = (2, 0) model which actually has

nc = (2, 2) supersymmetry. we have the following properties

1. for a generic choice of holomorphic potential w(x i) we do not have any
anti-ghost zero-modes. the critical set v 1
(0) where vi = iw(x j) con-
sists of a collection of non-degenerate points. the partition function is the
number of such points.

i

i

2. for a non-generic w(x i) we may have anti-ghost zero-modes. the critical
set v 1
(0) may be a higher dimensional subvariety of x. the net ghost
number violation in the path integral measure is always zero. thus the
rank of the anti-ghost bundle v is exactly the same as the complex dimen-
sion of v 1
(0). thus the partition function is well-dened and computes
the euler characteristic (v) of v. we can identify v with the tangent
bundle of v 1
(0). thus the partition function is the euler characteristic
of v 1
(0). this, in turn, can be identied with the euler characteristic
i
of x.

equivariant cohomological field theory

in the previous chapter we developed standard models of cohomological eld
theories associated with a kahler manifold x, tangent bundle t x and hermi-
tian holomorphic vector bundle e over x. in this chapter we generalize those
modes to the cases when there is a certain group g action. this generalization
is relevant since most of eld theory has a certain gauge symmetry. the models
in the previous chapter are obviously empty if the target space x is linear. on

21

the other hand models in this chapter have rich structures both for linear9 and
non-linear target spaces. this also allows us to consider more general classes of
target spaces like the space of a certain set of matrices, the space of a certain
set of elds on a manifold, etc.

the central tool will be the notion of equivariant cohomology and symplectic
quotients. the only practical dierence between the models in the previous
chapter and their equivariant generalizations are that the later models further
localize the path integrals to the vanishing locus of g-momentum map, modulo
the g symmetry.
if the g acts freely on such locus we recover the standard
models in the previous chapters now associated with the symplectic quotients.
the momentum map is a generalization of the familiar angular momentum
associated with a group of rotations in the classical mechanics.

3.1 equivariant toy model

we return to our toy model in sect. 2.1.1, where we considered a n-dimensional
kahler manifold (x, ) with kahler form  as the target space. now we assume
that there is a group g action

g  x  x,

(3.1)

preserving the complex and kahler structures. we consider the toy model with
the action functional s in (2.4). the action functional is invariant under g
thus the path integral is degenerated. we want to remove the gauge degree of
freedom as follows (compare with (2.8) )

where #(g) denotes the number of central elements of g, sgf and sgh denote the
gauge xing and ghost terms. the above procedure is the well-known faddeev-
popov-brst quantization on which i do not want to review here.10

a general problem with the path integral above is that the quotient space
x/g rarely has good topology and geometry. this means that it is dicult
make sense out of our (even for nite dimensional) path integral. furthermore
the geometrical meaning of the s and s supercharges on the quotient space
is not quite obvious. this problem can be avoided by considering equivariant
cohomology. for general references see [24][30][31].

9the relation between the previous section and the present section is best compared with

that of non-linear sigma-models and linear gauged sigma models in two-dimensions.

10 i only want to remark that it involves the lie algebra cohomology with the parity change.

22

3.1.1 extending our toy model

a nice route to introduce the equivariant cohomology is a simple generalization
of our toy model in sect. 2.1.1. now we assume that there is a group g action
gx  x on our target space x preserving the complex and kahler structures.
our goal is to extend our target space and supercharges s and s by introducing
extra elds such that

1. if g acts freely on x the degrees of freedom due to the extra elds disap-

pear,

2. the supercharges become  and  operators, after the parity change, on

the g-invariant subspace.

to implant the above idea we need the notion of lie derivative. consider
a manifold with g action. let lie(g) be the lie algebra of g. we will always
assume that we have a bi-invariant inner product < , > on lie(g) such that
we can identify lie(g) with its dual lie(g). let x i be the local coordinate
elds on x. the g action induces a vector v i
a t a such that an innitesimal g
action is represent by

we denote by ja the interior derivative with respect to the vector va, i.e.,

x i  x i + av i
a .

ja : r(x)  r1(x),

(ja)i2i3ir = rv i1 i1i2ir .

let la be the lie derivative with respect to the vector eld va;

la = dja + jad

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

then the innitesimal g action on   (x) is given by    + ala. thus
a dierential form  is g-invariant if la = 0. we note an obvious relation
alax i = av i
a .

now we extend our target space x by introducing a lie(g)-valued scalar

 = ata and modify the commutation relation (2.2) as11

s2 = 0,

{s, s} = iala,

s2 = 0.

(3.6)

thus {s, s} = 0 on the g-invariant subspace of x and the supercharges are
related with the  and  operators on the invariant subspace as in the case of
our previous toy model. the ghost numbers of  should be assigned (1, 1) to
match the ghost numbers in the anti-commutation relations above. the above
denes g-equivariant dolbeault cohomology [32][33].

11 where a is a in (3.3) incarnated as a eld.

23

by the new anti-commutation relations (3.6) the supersymmetry transfor-

mation laws (2.4) should be modied as follows

sx i = ii,
sx i = 0,

sx i = 0,

sx i = ii,

si = 0,
si = alax i,
si = alax i,
si = 0.

s = 0,

s = 0,

(3.7)

where we obtained the conditions s = s = 0 by demanding the algebra to
be closed. assume that we have a model with an action functional which is
invariant under the supersymmetries generated by the above new supercharges.
then we can apply the xed point theorem of witten and we have the following
xed point equation, deduced from the above

alax i = 0.

(3.8)

this equation tells us that a = 0 if g act freely on x while a can be non-zero
on a xed point of the g action. thus we achieved our initial two goals.

now we consider a supersymmetric action functional s. compare with the
non-equivariant case in sect. 2.1.1, an action functional should be invariant
under g in addition to ss = ss = 0. these conditions imply that one can also
apply the poincare lemma since the new supercharges are also nilpotent if they
are acting on g invariant quantities. thus s can be written by the same form
as the previous toy model

s = issk(x i, x i),

(3.9)

where k should be g invariant. 12 applying the transformation laws (3.7) we
have

(3.10)

(3.11)

where

k

s = i(cid:10), (cid:11)  igijij,
x i(cid:16)lax i(cid:17) .

a = i

later we shall see that  = at a is the equivariant g momentum map on
x. maintaining all the supersymmetry we consider the following more general
action functional s()

s() = issk + iaa

= i < ,    > igijij,

(3.12)

where  belongs to the center of g. we call the additional term a fi coupling.

12 actually k only needs to satisfy a weaker condition that it should invariant under gauge

transformations connected to the identity.

24

now we consider the partition function for the new action. we have

where

n = 1()/g.

(3.14)

in the above we assumed that g acts freely on the locus 1()  x. thus we
could simply integrate  out, which gives rise to the delta function supported
on 1(). then the quotient space n is smooth. our action functional s
reduces to the kahler form on the subspace 1(). since it is g invariant it

becomes, after the parity change, the kahler from e on the quotient space n.

what we showed is the symplectic reduction theorem of marsden and weinstein
[34].

we call our extended toy model the equivariant toy model. we note that the
equivariant toy model makes perfect sense even if we start from a at kahler
manifold x as our initial target space. we call the space n the eective target
space, which can be a very complicated non-linear space even if our initial target
space x is at.

before examining further properties of our model, we turn to a review of the
equivariant cohomology and momentum map. we refer for details on the equiv-
ariant cohomology and relation with momentum maps to a beautiful exposition
of atiyah and bott [30]. the idea is to replace x by a bigger space x  eg
such that the extended space has a nice quotient

xg = (x g eg)

which is equivalent to the original quotient m/g when it has a nice quotient.13
the g-equivariant cohomology h 
g(x) of x is dened as the ordinary cohomol-
ogy h (xg) of xg. for instance the g-equivariant cohomology of m is the
ordinary cohomology of x/g if g acts freely on x.14

we will briey review a convenient model of equivariant cohomology due to
cartan, of which variants will be used in this thesis. a crucial reference on the

13 the additional space eg is a xed universal g-bundle over the classifying space bg. the
homotopy quotient xg forms a ber bundle  : xg  bg with ber x. then we have the
following diagram

eg  eg  x  x

bg  eg g x  x/g





(3.15)

14note, however, g-equivariant cohomology of a point is h (bg) which is highly non-trivial.

25

cartan model for us is wittens paper [35]. the path integral of the equivariant
toy model reproduces a kahler version of wittens non-abelian equivariant
integration formula.

3.1.2 equivariant cohomology and momentum map

consider a manifold x with g action. let lie(g) be the lie algebra of g. we
will always assume that we have a bi-invariant inner product < , > on lie(g)
such that we can identify lie(g) with its dual lie(g).

let f un(lie(g)) denote the algebra of polynomial functions on lie(g) so
that an mth order homogeneous polynomial is considered to be of degree 2m.
the equivariant dierential forms 

g(x) on x are represented by

g(x) := ((x)  f un(lie(g)))g ,


(3.16)

where g denote the g-invariant part. the degree of such a form is the sum of
degrees of (x) and f un(lie(g)). one endows 
g(x) with the equivariant
dierential operator dg

dg = d  iaja,

d2
g = iala,

(3.17)

where j2
gauge transformation generated by a. thus on the space 

a = 0 and  = at a  lie(g). that is, d2

g = 0 modulo an innitesimal

g(x) we have15

g = 0.

bd2

the g-equivariant de rham cohomology on x is the cohomology of the complex
(
g(x), dg). the equivariant cohomology of x is the ordinary cohomology of
the quotient space if the group acts freely, otherwise it is something else. for
example h 

g(pt) is f un(lie(g)).

the symplectic case

now we consider a symplectic manifold x with symplectic form . assume
that we have a g action on x. under an innitesimal g action x i  x i +av i
a
the symplectic form transforms as    + ala. thus we have a vector
eld v i
a which is an innitesimal symplectic transformation whenever la = 0.
since d = 0 we have d(ja) = 0, thus at least locally we can write

ja = da.

(3.18)

the  = at a : x  lie(g) is called the g-momentum map.16 the obstruc-
tion for global existence of a is h 1(x). the momentum map is a generalization
of the familiar classical mechanical notion that x is a classical phase space and
g is a group of rotation and  is the angular momentum. the momentum map

15 an element in 

c = fba
the structure constants of g. then, it is also annihilated by ala since ala = ala.

g (x) is annihilated by la = la + fab

c are

cb 

c , where fab

16note that we identied lie(g) with its dual lie(g).

26

is equivariant if (g(x)) = (ad g)((x)). then g preserve the subspace 1()
when  is a centeral element. then the reduced phase space or the symplectic
quotient is dened by

n = (x  1())/g

(3.19)

the quotient space is a smooth symplectic manifold if  is a regular value. the

symplectic form e on n is obtained from  by restriction and reduction [34].

the equivariant cohomology and the momentum map are closely related [30].
note that the symplectic form  is not equivariantly closed, dg 6= 0. we have
a unique form, due to the degree, of equivariant extension g of 

g =  + i(, )

the condition dgg = 0 reduces to using dg = 0

< , d  j >= 0.

(3.20)

(3.21)

thus g is equivariantly closed i  is the momentum map (3.18). note that
g is g invariant, lag = 0, i the momentum map  is equivariant.

the kahler case

now we specialize to the case that x is a kahler manifold with kahler form
 and with g action, which preserve the complex structure and the kahler form.
the vector eld v i induced by the g action is decomposed into v i = v i + v i.
thus one can introduce interior derivatives a and a by contracting with v i
a
and v i

a , respectively, such that ja = a + a;

a : p,q(x)  p1,q(x),
a : p,q(x)  p,q1(x).

from the relation j2

a = 0 we have

2
a = 0,

{a, a} = 0,

2
a = 0.

it follows that

(3.22)

(3.23)

la = a + a + a + a.

(3.24)
we also decompose f un(lie(g)) such that an mth order homogeneous poly-
nomial in f un(lie(g)) is considered to be of degree (m, m). then equivariant
dierential forms ,

g (x) on x are represented by

g (x) := (,(x)  f un(lie(g)))g
,

similarly we decompose dg into

dg = g + g : 0

g (m ).

g(m ) = 1,0

g (m )  0,1

where

g =   iaa,
g =   iaa.

27

(3.25)

(3.26)

(3.27)

remark that  is assigned to degree (1, 1). the anti-commutation relations
between g and g are

2
g = 0,

{g, g} = iala,

2
g = 0.



(3.28)

this denes equivariant dolbeault cohomology on a kahler manifold. compar-
ing with the anti-commutation relations (3.6) we can identify our supercharges
s and s with g and g after the parity change (2.16). thus

s = ii 

s = ii 
x i

a

x i  av i
 av i
a

,


i

i .

(3.29)

now we examine the relation between the momentum map and equivariant
dolbeault cohomology. for the kahler case the relation (3.18) becomes, by
matching form degrees

a = a.

(3.30)

since the kahler form  can be written locally in terms of a kahler potential
f ,

we have

 = if,

ia(f ) = a.

using the relations {a, } = {, } = 0 we deduce that

a = ia(f )

up to a constant. combining all together we nd an important identity

iggf =  + i < ,  >,

(3.31)

(3.32)

(3.33)

(3.34)

which we obtained earlier in (3.9) and (3.10). thus minus the action functional,
s, is a g-equivariant kahler form after the parity change. note that the mo-
mentum map derived above is equivariant if the kahler potential is g invariant.
thus we showed all the assertions made in sect. 3.1.1.

3.1.3 the path integrals and non-abelian localization theorem

we now return to the equivariant toy model. we return to the partition function
z (3.13) and ask what will happen as we vary the fi term .

we have a classical theorem; the image of a proper momentum map of a
compact group is a convex polytope divided by walls [36][37][38]. as we vary
 the symplectic quotient n may undergo birational transformations if the
path of  crosses a wall, otherwise dieomorphic. for the non-proper case the
symplectic quotient does not exist. this does not imply that the partition
function is empty. recall that space of all bosonic elds is a copy of x and

28

the space of all . the correct picture is that the path integral is localized to
n  x/g for regular values of . the full equation for the localization is

   = 0,
ala(x i) = 0.

(3.35)

we call the non-trivial solutions 0 of above equations the zero-modes of . it
is clear that we have zero-modes of  whenever the g action has xed points in
1(), thus when  lies on a non-regular value 0. clearly the path integral
degenerates at such a value since the path integral measure contains zero-modes
of . let + < 0 <  we have

z(+) 6= z()

(3.36)

due to topology change. at 0 the partition function should be singular.

it is clear how to resolve the singularity of the path integral. we have to

regularize. we consider a more general action functional s(, ),

s(, ) = s() +


2

< ,  >

= i < ,    > +


2

(, )  igijij.

(3.37)

note that the additional term is invariant under g as well as all the supersym-
metry. the additional  dependent term changes the xed point equations of
the supersymmetry since the  equation of motion is now

i(  ) = .

(3.38)

consequently, for  6= 0, the path integral is localized to the locus of the following
equations

(cid:18) a
x(cid:19)(a  a) = 0.

(3.39)

now we also have contributions from higher critical points. thus, we have two
branches; (i) a   = 0, (ii) 
x  = 0. clearly the quotient n space develops
singularities when branches (i) and (ii) intersect. in such a case the integrand
of path integral contains the gaussian measure

ep

|0,|2

(3.40)

for the space of zero-modes 0, of . thus the path integral is non-singular.
consequently the politically correct version of the model is dened by the action
functional s(, ).

now we consider the correlation functions. a supersymmetric observable
should be g-invariant as well as invariant under s and s. such an observable
should be constructed from an equivariantly closed dierential form. an equiv-
ariant dierential form op,q of total degree (p, q) can be expanded as

op,q = p,q

0 + ap1,q1

a

+ abp2,q2

ab

+    ,

(3.41)

29

where p,q
ghost number (p, q). we have

  p,q(x). let bop,q be the parity change of op,q, thus carrying

.

(3.42)

thus bop,q is an s-invariant observable if op,q is an g-closed equivariant dier-

the correlation function of observables or the expectation value is dened

ential form.

where s = dim(g). applying the xed point theorem for the global supersym-
metry we see that the above integral can be written as a sum of contribution of
the critical points (3.39) of i =< ,  >. this is the non-abelian localization
theorem of witten [35], generalizing the more familiar abelian duistermaat-
heckman (dh) integration formula [36]. in the end our equivariant toy model
turns out to be very non-trivial.

3.2 the equivariant nc = (2, 2) model

in this section we develop the equivariant generalization of the nc = (2, 2) model
in sect. 2.2. we assume the same group g acting on x as in the previous sec-
tion. this naturally extend to the tangent space t x. recall that the partition
function of our toy model is the symplectic volume of the target space, while
the partition function of the equivariant toy model is the symplectic volume of
the symplectic quotient n, for generic values of , of x by g. similarly, the
partition function the equivariant version of nc = (2, 2) model, without holo-
morphic potential w, will be the euler characteristic (t n) of the symplectic
quotient n, for generic value of , of x by g. after turning on w, the path
integral reduces to the symplectic quotient m of the critical subset xcrit  x
of the potential w by g.

we consider the same type of supercharges carrying the same ghost num-

bers (p, q);

s+ : (+1, 0),
s : (1, 0),

s+ : (0, +1),
s : (0, 1).

(3.45)

30

now we postulate the supercharges to satisfy the following anti-commutation
relations

{s+, s+} = 0,
{s+, s} = 0,
{s, s} = 0,

++la,

{s+, s+} = ia
{s+, s} = iala,
{s+, s} = iala,
{s, s} = ia

la,

{s+, s+} = 0,
{s+, s} = 0,
{s, s} = 0,

(3.46)

which are equivariant generalizations of the commutation relations (2.26) and
(2.27) for the nc = (2, 2) model. for the g-invariant subspace the equivariant
supercharges are the same as the non-equivariant ones. here, in total, we intro-
duced four bosonic elds ,  and  taking values in lie(g). they carry the
following ghost numbers

++ : (+1, +1),
 : (1, 1),

 : (+1, 1),
 : (1, +1).

(3.47)

the anti-commutation relations above dene balanced g-equivariant dolbeault
cohomology [39]. this is the kahler version of the balanced equivariant coho-
mology [23].17

we should remark that the above algebra can be obtained by dimensional
reduction of the n = 1 supersymmetry algebra of four-dimensional super-yang-
mill theory and, equivalently, the algebra of nws = (2, 2) super-yang-mills
theory in two-dimensions. thus we may introduce other quantum numbers, as
in two-dimensions, the left and right u (1) r-charges (jl, jr) as follows

s+ : (+1, 0),
s : (0, +1),

s+ : (1, 0),
s : (0, 1).

(3.48)

the analogy with the two-dimensional nws = (2, 2) space-time supersymmetric
gauge theory, equivalently the linear gauged sigma-model [18][19] will be very
useful. indeed it is a trivial step to obtain a nws = (2, 2) model, and vice versa,
just by replacing a
la by the left and right moving covariant derivatives d
everywhere. then the indices  are identied with the left and right spinor
indices in two-dimensions. for example requiring the ghost number symmetry
is equivalent to requiring the two-dimensional lorentz symmetry.

3.2.1 the basic structure

now we examine the basic structure of the model.

the nc = (2, 2) multiplets

17 in our approach a balanced cohomological eld theory [40][7][23] is a nc = (1, 1) super-
symmetric sigma-model in (0+0) dimensions, whose target space can be a general riemannian
space.

where h i are auxiliary elds as in the non-equivariant nc = (2, 2) model. the
details of the transformation laws above depend on the ways the group g acts
on x i. one may have several dierent chiral multiplets. their transformation
laws are also determined as above once the complex structure and the group
action are given for the bosonic elds.

the fixed point equations

one can never over emphasize the importance of the xed point theorem of
witten. we have seen many times that the existence of global supersymmetry
determine the theories almost uniquely. such uniqueness becomes stronger as
many global supercharges we have.

33

from the above supersymmetry transformation laws we see that the simul-

taneous xed point equations for all the nc = (2, 2) are given by

h i = 0,
d = 0,
mla(x i) = 0,
a
[m, n] = 0,

(3.57)

where m, m = 1, . . . , 4 denote the four independent real lie(g)-valued scalar
components of ,  and its hermitian conjugate . the action functional, in
many respects, just gives the detailed form of the values of the auxiliary elds
d and h i. the path integral is localized to the solution space of the above
set of equations modulo the g-action. the third equation implies that m are
identically zero if g act freely on the subset h 1(0)  d1(0)  x. in such a
case the path integral reduces to an integral over the quotient space

(cid:0)h 1(0)  d1(0)(cid:1) /g.

(3.58)

we call this the eective target space. the nc = (2, 2) supersymmetry further
implies, as we shall see shortly, that the above space is a kahler manifold.

if one is interested in evaluating correlation functions of observables invariant
only under the supersymmetry generated by s+ and s+, the path integral is
localized to the locus of the following equations

and

h i = 0,

[, ] = 0,

d

ala(x i) = 0,

a
++la(x i) = 0,
[++, ] = 0,
[++, ] = 0.

(3.59)

(3.60)

3.3 action functional and partition function

we dene the general action functional s by demanding nc = (2, 2) supersym-
metry, the g-symmetry and the ghost number symmetry. we may, however,
not require the u (1)r symmetry in general. then s should have the following
form18

s =s+ss+sk(cid:0)x i, x i) + s+sw(cid:0)x i(cid:1) + s+sw(cid:0)x i(cid:1)
 s+ss+s(cid:10), (cid:11) + s+s < t,  > +s+s tr < , t >,

18the total kahler potential k(x i, x i) (cid:10), (cid:11) can be generalized to an arbitrary g-
invariant real functional ek(x i, x i; , ). then we may obtain a model whose eective target

space is non-kahler but has torsion and generally a dilaton.

(3.61)

34

where all potentials k(x i, x i), w(x i) and its hermitian conjugate w(x i) are

belongs to the center of lie(g). the rst line of the action functional (3.61) has
the same form as the non-equivariant nc = (2, 2) action functional. we remark
that the above action functional can be a quite strange object if k(x i, x i) is
non-linear as well as if x i are certain matrices.

expanding the action functional above we have the following terms depend-

ing on the auxiliary elds

s =(cid:10)d, d(cid:11)i(cid:10)d, (cid:11)+(cid:10)gijh i, h j(cid:11)i(cid:10)h i, iw(cid:11)i(cid:10)h i, iw(cid:11)+. . . , (3.63)

where  is the g-momentum map on the target space20 x as dened earlier in
(3.11), gij := ijk and iw = w/x i. we integrate out the auxiliary elds
d, h i and h i by imposing the following algebraic equations of motion

d =

i
2

(  ),

h i = igij w
x j

.

(3.64)

from our general discussion earlier, we see that the path integral is localized to
the space of solutions of the following equations

   = 0,
w
x i = 0,

(3.65)

modulo the g-symmetry. in other words the eective target space (3.58) is the
symplectic quotient at level  of the critical set h 1
(0)  x of the holomorphic
potential

i

equivalently m is the restriction of n, the symplectic quotient of x by g, to
the critical subset. those are compatible since h i is g-equivariant as w and s
are g-invariant. thus m is a kahler manifold, provided that  is generic. note
that the space of all bosonic elds is much bigger than x due to the additional
ane space of four real scalars m, m = 1, . . . , 4. the path integral is localized,
in addition to (3.65), to the space of solutions of

[m, n] = 0,

mla(x i) = 0,
a

(3.67)

modulo the gauge symmetry. as the basic principle of the equivariant cohomol-
ogy m = 0 if g acts freely while, otherwise, there is something else.

19the theta term plays no roles in the (0 + 0)-dimension we are considering here.
20a better terminology is to regard x as the space of all x is.

35

m :=(cid:0)h 1

i

(0)  1()(cid:1) /g.

(3.66)

now we assume that m is smooth. then our model is equivalent to the
non-equivariant nc = (2, 2) model with target space m. thus the partition
function is the euler characteristic of the eective target space;

z = (t m) = (m).

(3.68)

a beautiful fact is that our initial target space x may be innite dimensional
with an innite dimensional group g acting on it, while the nal target space
m can be nite dimensional.

3.3.1 the geometry of eective target space

it is obvious that the group action preserves the condition hi = 0 and the
subvariety h 1
(0)  x inherits the complex and kahler structures by restric-
tion. the quotient space m inherits the kahler structure from h 1
(0) by the
restrictions and the reduction.

i

i

if  takes on a generic value, the group g acts freely and m is a smooth
kahler manifold. for such a case the model can be identied with the non-
linear non-equivariant nc = (2, 2) model in sect. 2.2.2 with target space m.
this property is equivalent to the property of equivariant cohomology that the
equivariant cohomology is the ordinary cohomology of the quotient space if it
is smooth.

for non-generic  the quotient space develops singularities or even may not
exist at all. for such cases however one always has some extra degrees of freedom
not described by the moduli space, due to the extension of x/g to xg. those
extra degrees of freedom are represented by the solutions of (3.67) modulo gauge
symmetry. the rst equation in (3.67) show that no such a solution exists if
the g action act freely, without xed points, on x. if there are solutions they
span an ane space,21 which looks like a symmetric products of r4.

the beautiful relation between the symplectic and geometrical invariant the-
ory (git) quotients also is an important part of the story [41][42][38]. the es-
sential point is that the condition hi = 0 is preserved by the complexied group
action g c, while the condition d = 0 is only preserved by the real group action.
thus we may consider a complex quotient h 1
(0)/g c and try to compare with
the real quotient (h 1
(0)  d1(0))/g. in general there can be g c-orbits in
h 1
(0)  d1(0). thus we need to
consider a suitable subset in h 1
(0) for which a g c-orbit contains exactly one
solution of the equation d = 0. then the real equation d = 0 can be identied
with the gauge xing condition of the complex gauge symmetry of the complex
equations hi = 0.

that the complex quotient h 1
(0)ss/g c contains the symplectic quotient m0 as
open subset. a stable orbit is a semi-stable orbit if the points of the orbit have
at most nite stabilizers under the real g action. then the various symplectic
quotients m can be identied with the quotient space h 1(0)s/g c in dense

symplectic quotients m are birational with each others.

3.4 generalization to equivariant nc = (2, 0) model

now we consider the equivariant extension of the nc = (2, 0) model introduced
in sect. 2.3 or, equivalently, the generalization of the equivariant nws = (2, 2)
model in the previous section. we consider the same group g acting on x as
before but now we allow the g action to extend to a hermitian holomorphic
vector bundle e  x preserving the hermitian structure. we have two super-
charges s+ and s+, isomorphic to the dierentials of g-equivariant dolbeault
cohomology as in the equivariant toy model in sect. 3.1;

s2
+ = 0,

{s+, s+} = ia

++la,

s2
+ = 0.

(3.70)

comparing with the non-equivariant counterpart, the equivariant nc = (2, 0)
model has essentially one addition structure that the path integral is further
localized to the vanishing locus 1() of g-moment map. if g acts freely on
1() the model reduce to a standard nc = (2, 0) model associated with the
symplectic quotients. the observables of the model are given by g-equivariant
closed dierential forms, after the parity changes, as our equivariant toy model.
if g acts freely on 1() those observables become ordinary closed dierential
form on the symplectic quotient. comparing with our equivariant toy model
the additional structure is that the path integral is further localized to the locus
of vanishing holomorphic sections on e. we will use such property to dene a
more general hybrid nc = (2, 0) model. following the discussion in sect. 3.2 the
model is related with nws = (2, 0) world-sheet gauged sigma-model in (1 + 1)
dimensions by dimensional reduction [18].

3.4.1 basic structures

we may follow exactly the same route as we followed to arrive at the non-
equivariant nc = (2, 0) model from the non-equivariant nc = (2, 2) models.

first we write the nc = (2, 2) action functional s (3.61) in a form such that

37

only the s+ and s+ are manifest - compare with (2.69)-

s() =  s+s+(cid:18)d, (x i, x i)  e (cid:10), (cid:11) +dgij(x k, x k)i

the link s,

where the new indices run as ,  = 1, . . . , r and we maintain the hermiticity of
h. the nc = (2, 0) multiplets (x i, i
+) are holomorphic, i.e., s+x i = 0. we

note that  is holomorphic, i.e., s+ = 0. thus the nc = (2, 0) multiplet (, +)
is another holomorphic multiplet, while their hermitian conjugates (, +) form
an anti-holomorphic multiplet. we may simply remove them, or keep them
as they are still valued in lie(g), or just regard them as another holomor-
phic multiplet supplementing the multiplets (x i, i

here h(x i, x i) is a hermitian structure on a hermitian vector bundle e over
x, s(x i) a holomorphic section and (x i, x i) is the g-momentum map on x.
note that nc = (2, 0) symmetry of the above action functional is not obvious
due to the second line in (3.78). for example the s+ supersymmetry of the

let us summarize the basic structure of an equivariant nc = (2, 0) model.

1. a complex kahler target space x with a g symmetry as an isometry.
these data determine holomorphic multiplets and gauge multiplets as well
as their transformation laws and g-equivariant momentum map  : x 
lie(g).

2. a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle e  x over the target space x
with the g action preserving the hermitian structure. we may have up
to two g-equivariant holomorphic sections s and j orthogonal with each
others by a natural non-degenerated g invariant parings. those sections
determine fermi multiplets and their transformation laws.

given the data above, we have an unique family of equivariant nc = (2, 0)

models parameterized by the fi term .

3.4.2 the path integrals

expanding the action functional s (3.78) we have the following terms depending
on the auxiliary elds d, h  and h ,

s =(cid:10)d, d(cid:11)(cid:10)d, (cid:11)+(cid:10)hh , h (cid:11)i(cid:10)h , s(cid:11)i(cid:10)h , s(cid:11)+. . . . (3.80)

we integrate the auxiliary elds out by imposing the following algebraic equa-
tions of motion,

d =

1
2

h = ih

s.

(  ),

(3.81)

from our general discussion earlier, we see that the bosonic part of the path
integral reduces to an integral over the space of solutions of the following equa-
tions,

j(x i) = 0,
s(x i) = 0,
   = 0,

and

a
++lax i = 0,
[++, ] = 0,

(3.82)

(3.83)

(3.84)

modulo g-symmetry.

now we examine the properties of the path integral in some detail by apply-
ing the xed point theorem of witten. for simplicity assume that the space x
and the hermitian holomorphic bundle e are at. we also turn o the section
j, keeping s only. then the xed point locus of the s+ and s+ supersymmetry
is the symplectic quotient m of s1

 (0)  x by g;

m =(cid:0)1()  s1

 (0)(cid:1) /g.

we have the same set of observables as in the equivariant toy model, given by

s+ and s+ closed g-equivariant dierential forms bor,s wite ghost numbers (r, s).

let us rst assume that the section is generic and g acts freely on s1

x. then m is a smooth non-linear kahler manifold with complex dimensions

dimcm =  = n  r  dim g.

(3.95)

the above counting goes as follows. since s,  = 1, . . . , r, are generic they are
all independent and transverse. thus the condition s = 0 cuts out a complex
(n  r) smooth submanifold inside the complex n-dimensional ambient space x.
on the subspace we further impose dimg real equations a   = 0 and take
the quotient by the free g action. now we do not have zero-modes of  and

a non-generic situation arises when s,  = 1, . . . , r, are linearly dependent
to the remaining sections. then the complex dimension of m is given by n =

the section are transverse. we have r  zero-modes which span the anti-ghost
bundle v over m. the path integral becomes

* kym=1 borm,sm+ =zm

e(v)  eor1,s1  . . .  eork,sk .

(3.97)

a beautiful fact about this is that (x, e, g) can be all innite dimensional
while the space m can be a nite dimensional space. in particular x can be a
certain function space dened by the space of all elds of a certain gauge eld
theory on a manifold m . then the integral we are dealing with is a genuine

42

path integral of a non-trivial quantum eld theory on m , while the path integral
eventually reduces to an ordinary integral on a smooth nite dimensional space
m. the above is a key principle underlying cohomological eld theory [1][13].
in principle the above path integral formalism is well-dened regardless of the
properties the moduli space m.

finally we remark that a proper mathematical interpretation of our formal-
ism may be a certain equivariant version of fulton and macphersons intersec-
tion theory [25].

4 generalizations

in this section we consider three geneneralizations of an equivariant nc = (2, 0)
model.

4.1 deformation to holomorphic nc = (2, 0) model

in this subsection we introduce hybrid nc = (2, 0) model of the equivariant
nc = (2, 0) mode and the equivariant toy model in sect. 2.2. the resulting
hybrid model will have much better behavior than the original model when the
eective target space m has singularities. to motivate such a model we rst
compare the two models.

first of all both the models have the same supersymmetry generated by s+
and s+, which are the dierentials of equivariant dolbeault cohomology after the
parity change. secondly both the models share the same holomorphic multiplets
(x i, i
+) and their hermitian conjugates, which are anti-holomorphic multiplets
(x i, i
+). thus they share the same observables, given by equivariantly closed
dierential forms on x, the space of all x i, after the parity change.

a dierence is that the equivariant nc = (2, 0) model has the additional

fermi multiplets (
of the fermi multiplets are to restrict the (path) integral over x to the subspace
dened by j1
 (0)  x. for convenience we denote this subspace by
x 1,1  x. we saw that the path integral of the nc = (2, 0) model is localized to
the symplectic quotients m = (x 1,11() of x 1,1 by g. now we consider an
equivariant toy model whose initial target space is x 1,1. then, its path integral
is also localized to the same space m, provided that we set  = 0 in the action
functional s(, ) dened by (3.37). we also note that the partition function of

by the nc = (2, 0) model, where

the above equivariant toy model is the expectation value of exp (bg) evaluated

the rst term above is irrelevant as the path integral of the nc = (2, 0) is

hand, the above is the action functional of the equivariant toy model on x 1,1 and
the integration over  localizes the path integral by a delta function supported
on m in x 1,1. note that m = n|x 1,1 is the restriction of n - the symplectic
quotient of x by g - to x 1,1.

the above discussion motivates us to dene a new nc = (2, 0) model with the
following action functional sh(, 0), modifying the original nc = (2, 0) action
functional s in (3.78)

previous discussion we see that the partition function dened by the new action

original nc = (2, 0) action functional s (3.78).

(4.3)

we call the nc = (2, 0) model with the above action functional sh(, ) a holo-
morphic nc = (2, 0) model, see [43] for the rst example. now we immediately
see that the path integral of the holomorphic nc = (2, 0) model is governed
by wittens non-abelian localization principle [35]. the rst line of the above
action functional localizes the path integral to x 1,1. then, following the discus-
sions in sect. 2.2.3, the path integral can be written as the sum of contributions
of the critical points i = h  ,   i in x 1,1. also from the discussions in
sect. 2.2.3 the -dependent term regularizes the path integral when m develops
singularities.

4.1.1 the mapping between the two models

now we will give more wider viewpoints which contain the original and holo-
morphic nc = (2, 0) models as two special limits, following the original method
of witten [35]. witten considered the case without the fermi multiplets but
for general manifolds. the fermi multiplets will be purely spectators, and the
specialization to a kahler case will simplify the procedure.

consider the following one-parameter family of nc = (2, 0) supersymmetric

action functional s(),

if we set  = 0 we have the original nc = (2, 0) model. for  6= 0 we can
integrate out the nc = (2, 0) gauge multiplet, and we are left with

s() =  s+s+dh

since the additional -dependent term is closed by s+ and s+, the path integral
does not depend on  as long as  6= 0. the models with  = 0 and  6= 0 can
be dierent since new xed points can ow from the innity    in the eld
space [35].

if we take the limit   0, while  6= 0, we see that the dominant contribu-

tions to the path integral come from the critical points of i =(cid:10)  ,   (cid:11).

in the above the path integral should be independent of  6= 0. consequently
we see that the partition function of the above action functional can still be
written as a sum of contributions from the critical points of i. finally we may
take the limit    to remove all the -dependent terms and obtain the action
functional sh(, ) (4.3) of the holomorphic nc = (2, 0) model. thus we showed
that the partition function of the holomorphic nc = (2, 0) model can be written

as a sum of contributions from the critical points of i =(cid:10)  ,   (cid:11).

4.2 flows from nc = (2, 2) to nc = (2, 0) models

consider an equivariant nc = (2, 0) model as described in sect. 2.4. with
j = 0. such a model was classied by a g-equivariant hermitian holomorphic
bundle e  x with holomorphic section sa. in a generic situation the model
is equivalent to a non-linear nc = (2, 0) model which target space m is m =
(x  s1(0)  1())/g. in this section we dene a canonical embedding of
such a model to nc = (2, 2) model based on the tangent space t e of the total
space of bundle e  x. then we study the mapping from the nc = (2, 2)
to the nc = (2, 0) model. we will see that the above circle of ideas leads us
to nd a nc = (2, 0) model which is equivalent to the original nc = (2, 0)
model. from the viewpoint of the original nc = (2, 0) model there is no a priori
reason of such a equivalence to a completely dierent model. for simplicity
we restricted to the linear model.

45

4.2.1 embedding of a nc = (2, 0) model to nc = (2, 2) model.

the basic idea behind extension to nc = (2, 2) model is that one can regard the
total space of holomorphic bundle e  x as the target space of a nc = (2, 2)
model. then we have to supply local holomorphic coordinates elds for ber
space of the bundle e  x. thus we introduce adjoint-valued bosonic spectral
elds b and its superpartner 
+. now the former equivariant holomorphic sec-
tion s(x i) of bundle e  x corresponds to holomorphic vector on the target
space e but being supported only on x. thus the g-equivariant holomor-
phic vector s(x i) should be extended over the whole space e. furthermore
nc = (2, 2) supersymmetry requires that such holomorphic vector should be
gradient vector of a non-degenerated g-invariant holomorphic function w, i.e,
s+w = 0, of the target space e.

now demanding nc = (2, 2) supersymmetry will take care of everything.
recall that the nc = (2, 0) model has a lie(g)-valued gauge multiplet associated
with the group action of g. we add a lie(g)-valued holomorphic multiplet

now we consider the following nc = (2, 2) supersymmetric action functional

s =s+s+ss(cid:18) nxi=1(cid:10)x i, x i(cid:11) +
+ s+sw(cid:0)x i, b(cid:1) + s+sw(cid:16)x i, b(cid:17)

+ s+s < t,  > +s+s < , t > .

rx=1(cid:10)b, b(cid:11) < ,  >(cid:19)

(4.10)

to relate the above model with the initial nc = (2, 0) model we assume the
following conditions

w
b = s(x i),

(4.11)

where s is the holomorphic section of e. this condition implies that w(x i, b)
is linear in b. we will utilize this property later. it is useful to rewrite the
action functional s (4.10) such that only the nc = (2, 0) symmetry is manifest

s =  is+s+(cid:18)(cid:10), x + f  (cid:11) +x(cid:10)i
, s(cid:11)(cid:19) + is+(cid:18)(cid:10)i

(4.12)
where x and f are the momentum maps on x and the bre of e, respectively,
while

gi(x j, b) :=


x i w(x j, b).

(4.13)

note that gi is linear in b since w is linear in b.

applying the xed point theorem we see that the path integral is localized
to the solution space of the following equations, modulo the group action of g

and

s(x i) = 0,
gi(x j, b) = 0,
x (x i, x i) + f (b, b)   = 0,

mla(x i) = 0,
a
mla(b) = 0,
a
[m, n] = 0,
[m, m] = 0.

(4.14)

(4.15)

this model, for a generic value of  implying m = 0 as usual, reduce to the
non-linear nc = (2, 2) model whose target space m is the space of all solutions
of the equations (4.14) modulo g-symmetry.

4.2.2 perturbation to a nc = (2, 0) model

now we want to perturb the nc = (2, 2) model above to a nc = (2, 0) model by
breaking the nc = (0, 2) supersymmetry generated by s and s. this can be
done by giving bare mass to all the newly introduced multiplets given by

(, +),

(i

, h i),

(b, 
+)

(4.16)

and their conjugates. then the model ows to the original nc = (2, 0) model
if we take the bare mass to innity. such bare mass terms will have special
geometrical meaning.

note that there is a natural u (1) = s1 group acting on b, while leaving
xed the x i, such that the momentum map f remains invariant. this s1-
action is given by

s1 : (x i, b)  (x i, b),

(4.17)
where  = 1. note that the above s1-action does not change the rst and
the last equations of (4.14). the lhs of the second equation of (4.14) will be
multiplied by , which does not alter the solution space of the equation. thus
the s1-action is a symmetry of the eective target space m.

it is important to note that the above u (1) needs not be a symmetry of
our nws = (2, 2) model. to be such a symmetry, the s1 action (4.17) should
be extended to all the superpartners. that is, i
 and h i should be invariant
 and h  should carry the u (1)-charge 1. we, however,
under u (1) while 
demand that the above u (1) is compatible with the nc = (2, 0) supersymmetry
generated by s+ and s+ supercharges. from the expression (4.12) of s with
manifest nc = (2, 0) symmetry we see that the i
 should carry u (1) charge 1,
since gi(x j, b) is linear in b. then, by examining the supersymmetry trans-
formation laws for the supercharges s+ and s+, we see that the s1-symmetry
(4.17) should be extended to all the nc = (2, 0) multiplets in (4.16) as follows

s1 : (b, 
s1 : (i
s1 : (, +)  (, +).

+)  (b, 
+)
, h i),

, h i)  (i

(4.18)

that is, we give u (1)-charges to the elds in (4.16) while all the other elds
remain neutral. clearly this cant be done while maintaining the full nc = (2, 2)
supersymmetry.

recall that the nc = (2, 0) supercharges s+ and s+ satisfy now familiar

anti-commutation relations

s2
+ = 0,

{s+, s+} = ia

++la,

s2
+ = 0,

(4.19)

dening the g-equivariant dolbeault cohomology. since we have an additional
s1 acting on our system it is natural to extend the above to g  s1-equivariant
cohomology. then the new supercharges, still to be denoted s+ and s+, satisfy
the following anti-commutation relations

s2
+ = 0,

{s+, s+} = ia

++la  imls1,

s2
+ = 0,

(4.20)

48

where we introduced a parameter m taking values in lie(s1). the supersym-
metry transformation laws should be modied accordingly.

finally we dene the following nc = (2, 0) supersymmetric action functional

s(m, m) = s + ms+s+(cid:18) rx=1(cid:10)b, b(cid:11) (cid:10), (cid:11)(cid:19),

(4.21)

where s is dened by the same formula as the action functional in (4.12) but
with the modied supersymmetry. the new action functional s(m, m), com-
pared to the nc = (2, 2) symmetric action s, is

s(m, m) = s + mmx (cid:10)b, b(cid:11)  imx (cid:10)

+, 

+(cid:11) + mm(cid:10), (cid:11)  im(cid:10)+, +(cid:11)
(cid:11),

, i

 im(cid:10), f  [, ](cid:11) + im(cid:10)++, f  [, ](cid:11) + imxi (cid:10)i

(4.22)
containing the desired mass terms. we note that the mass terms contain the
hamiltonian hs1 of the s1 symmetry on the space of all b and ;

hs1 = ix (cid:10)b, b(cid:11) + i(cid:10), (cid:11).

(4.23)

this fact will play a crucial role later.

now we examine the equation for xed points. since we only have s+ and
s+ supersymmetry the path integral is localized to the xed point locus of those
symmetries, modulo the g symmetry. we have

ala(x i) = 0,
ala(b) = 0,
s(x i) = 0,
gi(x j, b) = 0,
x (x i, x i) + f (b, b)  [, ]   = 0,

[, ] = 0,
ala(x i) = 0,
ala(b) + mb = 0,
[, ]  m = 0.

(4.24)

(4.25)

and

the set of equations in (4.24) cut out a subspace of the space of all x i, b
and . after modding out the g-symmetry we get the eective target space

fm of our nc = (2, 0) model. following the previous general discussions we
expect that fm is a kahler manifold at least for the generic case. the set

of equations in (4.25) represent gauge degrees of freedom. in particular those

49

equations implies the path integral is localized to the xed point of s1 action

onfm.

we always have trivial xed points, namely b =  = 0. we call such xed
points branch (i). in branch (i) the path integral is localized to the solution
space of the following equations, modulo g-symmetry,

ala(x i) = 0,
x (x i, x i)   = 0.

(4.26)

which are exactly the generic xed point equations for the original nc = (2, 0)
model. there are other xed points with b,  6= 0 when the s1-action can be
undone by the g action. the last two equations in (4.25) exactly stand for such
property. we call such xed points branch (ii).

the above localization principle can also be obtained from a dierent view-
point. we consider a limit |m|  . then the dominant contributions to the
path integral come from the set of critical points of the hamiltonian hs1 de-
ned by (4.23). it is well-known that the critical points of the hamiltonian of
a s1 action are exactly the same as the xed points of the s1 action. one may
evaluate the partition function in such a limit and set |m| = 0 afterwards, to
get the partition function of the nc = (2, 2) model.

now we assume that everything is generic, so that we do not have any zero-
modes of anti-ghosts, 
, as well as any zero-modes of the nc = (2, 0)
gauge multiplets. then the partition function of the action functional s(m, m)
in (4.25) reduces to the following integral

, i

exp imhs1 + ix (cid:10)

+, 

+(cid:11) + i(cid:10)+, +(cid:11)! ,

(4.27)

z =z
em

where we regard m and m as independent numbers and scaled away the overall

that there is a missing term since the fermionic terms above correspond to the

m. the above resembles the dh integration formula onfm. we see, however,
kahler form only on the subspace of fm given by x i = 0. we can provide
the missing term by evaluating the correlation function of exp(i(cid:10)++, x(cid:11) +
ip(cid:10)i

g on x.
note that it is an observable of the original nc = (2, 0) model we started from.
assuming the same generic situation as above, the correlation function reduces
to the following integral

+(cid:11)), where the exponent is the g-equivariant kahler form bx

+, i

ge =z
debx
em

exp (imhs1 + e) ,

(4.28)

where e denote the kahler form onfm . now we have exactly the dh integra-

tion formula [36]. the integral can be written as the sum of contributions from
the xed points of the s1-action.

we saw that we have two branches. in branch (i) the xed point locus is the
eective target space m of the original nc = (2, 0) model. the hamiltonian

50

hs1 in this branch is simply zero. thus we are evaluating the symplectic volume
of m. this is a correlation function of the original nc = (2, 0) model.
in
branch (ii) the value h f
s1 of hs1 at a xed point is non-zero. so the integral for
each xed point is weighted by a phase factor exp(imh f
s1). for both branches
the integral is weighted by a one loop determinant coming from the transverse
degrees of freedom. we note that such a determinant contains factors of m
with certain weights depending on the particular xed points. after evaluating
the dh integral we can set m = 0. then we may obtain many relations by
imposing that the poles should be cancelled order by order between the two
dierent branches, since the limit m  0 should be smooth in the path integral
of the massive nc = (2, 0) model. the partition function of the nc = (2, 2)
model is given by a sum of terms with order zero in m. one can also obtain
the symplectic volume of m in terms of a sum of contributions coming from
branch (ii).

in the real situation life is more complicated since it is dicult to achieve

the generic conditions and the spacefm may be non-compact. its is in principle

possible to elaborate on the above procedure and perform the integral. even
if we cant do such an integral due to technicalities we can at least see that
the essential information on the correlation function of the original nc = (2, 0)
model is contained in the xed points which belongs to branch (ii).
