abstract
the variational method is applied within the context of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics to provide information about the energy and eigenfunction of the lowest
levels of a hamiltonian. the approach is illustrated by the case of the morse potential
applied to several diatomic molecules and the results are compared with stablished
results.

i. introduction
two decades ago supersymmetric quantum mechanics, sqm, was born as a simplest
case of eld theory in the study of susy breaking mechanism of higher dimensional
quantum eld theories, developed to unify the four fundamental interactions in nature,
namely the electroweak, strong and gravitational interactions. so far, sqm has been
extensively used to explore dierent aspects of non-relativistic quantum mechanical
systems (see, for instance, [1]-[2] and references therein). the new algebraic method is
specially good to treat analytically solvable potential problems, [3], [4]. nevertheless,
the approximation methods have shown to be of great interest to provide new results
in potential problems. in this context, one has recently suggested that the variational
method could be applied within the formalism of sqm, [5]-[7]. this approach has
already been successfully applied to the hulthen potential, [7]. here the technique
is applied to the morse potential, one of the most successful models to represent the
states of diatomic molecules, [8], [9] . the results are shown to be in good agreamment
with the numerical data and results from the other approximation techniques.

the formalism of variational method can be found in several text books of quan-
tum mechanics, (see for instance [10]); it can be used to obtain the approximate
energy spectra of potentials, in particular, the ground-state. the approach consists
in using the trial wave-function (r) that depends of a number of parameters and in

varying these parameters in the expression for the expectation value of the energy

e = r hdr
r |  |2 dr

(1)

where h is the hamiltonian of the system. the variational parameters in  are varied
until the expectation value of the energy is minimum. this value is an upper limit of
the energy level. usually this method is applied only to get the ground state energy,
although it can be applied to get the energy of the excited states as well.

thus the central point of the variational method approach is the obtention of the
trial wavefunction. at this crucial point the superalgebra is used to obtain this func-
tion. in what follows, we briey review the main principles of sqm and introduce the
variational method. the case of angular momentum l = 0, which is exactly solvable,
is explicitly evaluated from sqm formalism in order to get the hierarchy. we then
apply the variational scheme to the morse potential for dierent values of l and for
various diatomic molecules and compare the results with known results from other
numerical methods, [11], [12].

ii. supersymmetric quantum mechanics

in sqm, [1]-[7], for n = 2 we have two nilpotent operators, q and q+, that satisfy

the algebra

{q, q+} = hss

; q2 = q+2 = 0,

where hss is the supersymmetric hamiltonian. this algebra can be realized as

q =   0

0 !
a 0 ! , q+ =   0 a+

0

0

(2)

(3)

where a are bosonic operators. with this realization the supersymmetric hamilto-
nian hss is given by

hss =   a+a

0

0

aa+ ! =   h +

0 h  ! .

0

(4)

h  are called supersymmetric partner hamiltonians and share the same spectra,
apart from the nondegenerate ground state. using the super-algebra a given hamil-
tonian can be factorized in terms of the bosonic operators. in h = c = 1 units, it is
given by

h1 =

d2
dr2 + v1(r) = a+

where e(1)

tial term. the bosonic operators are dened by

(6)

where the superpotential w1(r) satises the riccati equation

w 2

1  w 

1 = 2v1(r)  2e(1)
0 .

the eigenfunction for the lowest state is related to the superpotential w as

(1)

0 (r) = nexp(z r

w1(r)dr).

now it is possible to construct the supersymmetric partner hamiltonian,

h2 = a

if one factorizes h2 in terms of a new pair of bosonic operators, a

h2 = a+

0 =

where e(2)

is the lowest eigenvalue of h2 and w2 satisfy the riccati equation,

w 2

2  w 

2 = 2v2(r)  2e(2)
0 .

(7)

(9)

(10)

(11)

thus a whole hierarchy of hamiltonians can be constructed , with simple relations
connecting the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the n-members, [1], [13]-[15]

in this work our interest is in the ground-state eigenfunction, to apply the vari-
ational method. as shown above, in sqm formalism the ground state eigenfunction
can be determined from the superpotential w (r), which satises the riccati equation,
eq.(7). usually, if the potential is not exactly solvable, it is easier to determine an
approximation for the superpotential in eq.(7) than an eigenfunction that satises
the schroedinger equation for the original hamiltonian. thus we make an ansatz
in the superpotential based in the superalgebra information in order to evaluate the
trial wavefunction that minimizes the expectation value of the energy, eq.(1). this
formalism is applied to the morse potential.

iii. the morse potential

3

for the diatomic system, the three dimensional morse oscillator can be written

as,

vm = d(e2a(rre)  2ea(rre))

(16)

where d is the dissociation energy, re is the equilibrium internuclear distance and a
is the range parameter. we rewrite the original schroedinger equation h = e in
terms of a new varible y,

 

d2
dy2 +

l(l + 1)

y2 + 2(e2(yye)  2e(yye))! (y) = (y)

where y = ar and the constants are set like

2md
a2h2 , e = 
and the parameter m is the reduced mass of the molecule.

ye = are ,

2 =

h2a2
2m

(17)

(18)

case l = 0
in this case the schroedinger equation is exactly solvable and therefore the hierar-
chy of hamiltonians can be constructed. for this case the schroedinger equation is
reduced to the form

 

d2

dy2 + 2(e2(yye)  2e(yye))! (y) = (y)

the associated riccati equation is then

w 2

1  w 

1 + (1)

0 = v1(y)

with

whose solution is given by

v1(y) = 2(e2(yye)  2e(yye))

w1(y) = e(yye) + (  1/2)

and the ground-state energy is

(1)
0 = (  1/2)2

to nd the second member of the super-family we solve the equation

w 2

1 + w 

1 + (1)

0 = v2(r)

we then nd that the superpartner is given by

w2(y) = e(yye) + (  3/2)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

and the ground-state energy is

(2)
0 = (  3/2)2.

(26)

the process of factorization can be continued and the whole hierarchy can be evalu-
ated. the result is

vn+1(y) = 2(e2(yye)  2e(yye)) + 2ne(yye)

wn+1(y) = e(yye) + ( 

2n + 1

2

)

(27)

(n+1)
0

= ( 

2n + 1

)2.

case l 6= 0
in this case an analytical exact soluction cannot be determined. nevertheless, based
in the above arguments on how to obtain the trial wavefunction, we make the following
ansatz for the superpotential

w1(y) = e(yye) 

(l + 1)

y

+ c.

(28)

the rst term is taken from the one-dimensional morse superpotential, case of l = 0,
eq.(22), [16]. the knowledge of the second term comes from the study of three-
dimensional potentials, (see, for instance, assyntotically linear potential, [17], and the
truncated coulomb potential, [18]). the c-number c will be taken as the variational
parameter in the trial wavefunction.

the eigenfunction obtained from eq. (8) is then

(y)  ee(yye)

yl+1 ecy

(29)

using this expression as a trial wavefunction in the variational method we change

the parameter c by the variational parameter , i.e.,
 = (y, c = )  ee(yye)

yl+1 ey.

(30)

the energy is then obtained by minimisation of the energy expectation value with
respect to . thus, the equation to be minimised is

e = r 

0 (y)[ d2

dy2 + 2(e2(yye)  2e(yye)) + l(l+1)

y2

](y)dy

.

(31)

we have used this expression to minimize the energy expectation value of various
molecules: h2, hcl, co and lih. the explicit values of the energy for n = 0 and
dierent values of l are shown, for known values of their respective potential param-
eters, [19]: d, a, re and m.

we stress that in fact we are dealing with an eective potential vef f that satises

riccati equation, i.e.,

(32)
where w1 = w1() is given by eq.(28) and  is the parameter that minimises the
energy of eq.(31). it is given by

1 + e()

vef f (y) = w 2

for low energies the eective potential is quite similar to the real morse potential and
this is why our results are in such a good agreement with the other results.

iv. conclusions

the sqm formalism was used to explore the morse potential. the hierarchy of
hamiltonians was evaluated for the case of angular momentum l = 0, for which the
morse potential is exactly solvable.

we have shown a new approach through the application of the variational method

with the sqm formalism to evaluate the eigenvalues of the morse oscillator for
dierent values of the angular momentum l. the determination of the trial wave
function motivated by sqm was made by an ansatz in the superpotential. the
application of the method for diatomic molecules indicated that the values obtained
are in very good agreement with shifted large-n tecnique results, (slnt), modied
large-n tecnique results (slnt) and numerical data.

we conclude that the conception of the trial wavefunction through the superpo-
tential is a simple and good alternative procedure that enables to evaluate the energy
eigenvalues with a reasoble accuracy. this is not a priori obvious and it suggests that
it is a suitable method to treat other potentials.
