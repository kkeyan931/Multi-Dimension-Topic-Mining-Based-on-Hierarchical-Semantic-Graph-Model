abstract

the spin of a glueball is usually taken as coming from the spin (and possibly

the orbital angular momentum) of its constituent gluons. in light of the dif-

culties in accounting for the spin of the proton from its constituent quarks,

the spin of glueballs is reexamined. the starting point is the fundamental

qcd eld angular momentum operator written in terms of the chromoelec-

tric and chromomagnetic elds. first, we look at the restrictions placed on

the structure of glueballs from the requirement that the qcd eld angular

momentum operator should satisfy the standard commutation relationships.

this can be compared to the electromagnetic charge/monopole system, where

the quantization of the eld angular momentum places restrictions (i.e. the

dirac condition) on the system. second, we look at the expectation value of

this operator under some simplifying assumptions.

i. introduction

one of the results of the 1987 emc experiment [1] was to show that the spin of the

proton did not come solely from the spin of the valence quarks as naive quark models

indicated. after the emc experiment other possible contributing sources to the protons

spin were considered, such as angular momentum from sea quarks, angular momentum from

the orbital motion of valence quarks, and angular momentum from the chromodynamic eld.

in light of this surprise 1 in the make up of the spin of the proton, we want to take a

closer look at the spin of pure glue bound states. in the case of glueballs there is currently

no absolute experimental evidence for their existence (see ref. [3] for the status of various

candidates). thus, presently there is no need to explain anything in regards to the spin of

the glueballs, since there is no clear cut discrepancy between experiment and the theoretical

models. however, since the simple quark models did not work in accounting for the spin

structure of the proton, it is not an unreasonable assumption that a similar problem may

exist for the simple theoretical models of the glueballs spin. while most glueball studies

focus on the mass spectrum of glueballs, here we want to examine the glueballs spin, starting

from the fundamental gluonic eld angular momentum operator (given below in eq. (1)).

the gauge-invariant qcd eld angular momentum operator [4] which is responsible for

the glueballs spin is

jgb = z d3x [x  (ea  ba)]

(1)

where ea, ba are the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic elds, and a is an su(3) color

index. except for the color indices this form of the pure gauge eld angular momentum is

similar to the abelian case [5], and like the abelian form contains both spin and orbital

contributions. it is not possible to split eq. (1) into a separate spin and orbital part in

1in ref. [2] there was already an early hint that the spin of the proton might not be as simple as

quark models indicated

2

a gauge-invariant way [6] [7]. since eq.

(1) represents the total angular momentum of

the glueball, it is required to satisfy the standard quantum mechanical angular momentum

commutation relationship

[j i

gb, j j

gb] = iijkj k

gb

(2)

the main point of this paper is that, in general, one expects that the requirement of eq.

(2) will place some restrictions on the form of the chromodynamic elds, ea, ba, and on the

structure of glueballs.

before proceeding with the details of the calculation of [j i

gb, j j

gb] we should ask if it

is physically reasonable that eq. (2) should place restrictions on the color elds. for the

electromagnetic interaction there are also systems which carry eld angular momentum, such

as the charge/monopole conguration. in this example the angular momentum commutators

do place a restriction on the system [8] : the magnetic charge is restricted to take on dirac

values (i.e. eg = n/2 with n an integer). based on this electromagnetic example one might

similarly expect that eq.

(2) would place restrictions on qcd systems. one dierence

between qcd and qed is that for qed systems with eld angular momentum (e.g. the

charge/monopole system or the charge/magnetic dipole system [9]) one generally knows to a

very good approximation the form of the elds. thus the functional form of the eld angular

momentum can be determined analytically, and the commutation rules can be worked out

explicitly. if on the other hand the functional form of the electromagnetic elds were not

known to such a good approximation (as is the case with the color elds of qcd) then the

angular momentum algebra might lead to broader restrictions (i.e. ruling out a large class

of possible eld congurations).

it would be a greater surprise if any arbitrary form for

the color elds satised the angular momentum algebra. there is a subtle point in these

electromagnetic systems with eld angular momentum : the eld angular momentum by

itself does not satisfy the commutation relationships.

it is only the combination of eld

plus particle angular momentum that satises the commutators. here we will nd that a

similar restriction might apply to jgb  that the glueball eld angular momentum may be

3

forced to combine with some other angular momentum in order to satisfy the commutation

relationships.

ii. standard picture of glueball spin

there are several methods for investigating glueballs. the most rigorous method is via

the numerical calculations of lattice gauge theories. the properties of the glueballs which are

most commonly investigated in this way are their masses, string tension, and deconnement

temperature. in either lattice calculations or in phenomenological models, the spin of the

glueball is determined based on some simplifying assumptions. for example, glueballs can be

associated with such gauge invariant qcd eld strength operators [10] as f a

f 

a , f a


f 
a ,

which are spin 0, or f a

f 

a , f a


f 

a , which are spin 2.

in this last case there is some

ambiguity as to whether these operators should be associated with one glueball of spin 2, or

two spin 0 glueballs in a d-wave state. usually one chooses the former case for simplicity.

however, we will argue that the angular momentum algebra may restrict glueballs to always

be spin 0, in which case the latter choice would be required. there is also some uncertainty

in the spin assignment of glueballs in lattice studies as pointed out in a recent lattice glueball

review [11]. essentially for a given irreducible representation of the lattice rotational group

there are states with dierent values of total angular momentum which reduce to the same

continuum state. usually one makes the simplest choice and associates a given continuum

state with the lattice state with the minimum value of total angular momentum.

one can also investigate glueballs using various phenomenological models [12], such as

bag models [13] or using massive constituent gluons [14]. both of these approaches roughly

picture the glueballs as composed of two or three valence gluons. the glueball then has a

total spin which is taken as coming from the sum of the orbital and spin angular momentum

of these valence gluons (i.e. jgb = p(li + si) ). this kind of picture is similar in spirit to

the quark models which had the spin of the proton coming only from the valence quarks.

since the simple quark models had diculties giving the correct proton spin structure, a

4

similar problem may occur with the glueball spin structure in these simple models.

iii. gluonic field angular momentum

eq. (1) can be recast in index notation as j i

gb = 1

2ijkj jk where

j jk = z d3xm 0jk(~x)

m 0jk are some of the components of the rank 3 tensor m 

m  = t x  t x  m 0jk = t 0kxj  t 0jxk

(3)

(4)

t 0k, t 0j are the time-space components of the energy-momentum tensor t  of the yang-

mills gauge elds

t  =

1
4

gf af a

  f  af  a

  t 0k = f 0i af k a

i

(5)

the yang-mills elds tensor components, f 0i a, f ki a, are the color electric and color magnetic

elds respectively. in terms of the gauge elds these are

f a
0i = 0aa

i  iaa

0 + gf abcab

0ac

i  ea

i

f a
ij = iaa

j  jaa

i + gf abcab

i ac

j  ijkba

k

(6)

using this string of denitions we can write down the gluon eld angular momentum of eq.

(1) in index form as

j i

gb = ilmz d3x(cid:16)f 0n af m a

n (cid:17) xl

(7)

iv. angular momentum commutation relationships

in this section we will use the expression in eq. (7) to calculate the commutator for the

pure glueball angular momentum. we will not write out the integrals r d3x.... since these

5

can always be applied after taking the commutator of the integrand in eq. (7). from eq.

(7) we have

[j i

gb(x), j j

gb(y)] = ilmjpqxlxp[(f 0n a(x)f m a

n (x)), (f 0r b(y)f q b

r (y))]

= ilmjpqxlxp(f 0n af 0r b[f m a

n , f q b

r ] + f 0n a[f m a

n , f 0r b]f q b

r

+ f 0r b[f 0n a, f q b

r ]f m a

n + [f 0n a, f 0r b]f m a

n f q b
r )

(8)

in the last line the x and y dependences have not been written out explicitly. the 

s and xi s have been pulled outside the commutator brackets since they commute with

one another and with f a

. standard commutator algebra has been used to write things

in terms of two term commutators. none of the commutators above will have any non-

trivial contribution coming from the su(3) group structure of the elds, since the f a

  s

are all simply su(3) components. another way to see this is to write f a

 in terms of the

matrix eld strength tensor, f  f a

t a. using the standard normalization for the group

generators (t r[t at b] = 1

2ab where t r = trace) f a

 can be written as f a

 = 2t r[ft a].

since the group factors have been traced over they will only give trivial commutators in eq.

(8). any possible non-trivial commutation structure in eq. (8) arises, as in ref. [15], from

representing the gauge potentials in terms of creation/annihilation operators.

in the canonical formalism, where the gauge elds are given by creation/annihilation

operators, the su(3) gauge elds satisfy the following commutation relationships [16]

[aa

i (x, t), eb

j (y, t)] = iijab3(x  y)

[ea

i (x, t), eb

j (y, t)] = [aa

(x, t), ab

(y, t)] = 0

(9)

one can expand the chromoelectric eld in the above commutators as eb

j = f b

0j =

0ab

j  jab

0 + gf bcdac

0ad

j . then using the last commutator in eq.

(9) only the time

derivative term in the chromoelectric eld expansion gives a nontrivial commutator (i.e.

[aa

i (x, t), (y)

j ab

0(y, t)] = (y)

j

[aa

i (x, t), ab

0(y, t)] = 0 and [aa

i (x, t), ac

0ad

j ] = 0 by the last com-

mutator in eq. (9). in the rst example the superscript (y) indicates that the derivative is

6

taken with respect to y). thus the commutation relationships involving the chromoelectric

eld can be rewritten as

[aa

i (x, t), 0ab

j(y, t)] = iijab3(x  y)

[0aa

i (x, t), 0ab

j(y, t)] = 0

(10)

except for the group index kronecker delta these are identical to the eld commutators in

an abelian theory [17].

now in eq. (8) the commutator term [f m a

n , f q b

r ], when expanded in terms of the poten-

tials involves terms like [maa

n, gf bef aeqaf

r ] or [maa

n, qab

r] or [gf acdabmac

n, gf bef aeqaf

r ].

by commutator algebra these can all be reduced to sums of commutators like [ac

n, af

r ] or

[maa

n, qab

r] = mq[aa

n, ab

r] or [maa

n, aeq] = m[aa

n, aeq] (i.e. commutators of the gauge

potential with itself or with its spatial derivatives). all the these vanish by the last commu-

tation relationship in eq. (9) thus in eq. (8) [f m a

n , f q b

r ] = 0.

the remaining terms from eq.

(8) involve commutators between f 0i a and itself or

between , f 0i a and f jk b. these three commutators can be evaluated by expanding f 0i a

and f jk b in terms of the gauge potentials. it is easy to see that the only non-trivial part of

these three commutators comes from the commutation of the time derivative term in f 0i a

(i.e. 0ai a) with the gauge potential (ak b) or its spatial derivative (jak b). since glueballs

are bound states one has the extra physical constraint that the gauge potentials are time

independent 0ai a = 0. taking this physical constraint into account the chromoelectric

part of the eld strength tensor simplies to f 0i a = iaa

0 + gf abcab

0ac
i .

(strictly one

can not set the operator, 0ai a, equal to zero, but this condition should be applied to the

glueball states, |gi, as is done in the following section. this gupta-bleuler-like procedure

could easily be applied here and would not change the nal result in eq. (11) below). from

the commutation relationships in eqs. (9) and (10) one can see that each of these terms

commutes with other gauge potential components, aa

, or with spatial derivatives of gauge

potential components. thus the commutators for the glueball angular momentum operator

yields

7

[j i

gb, j j

gb] = 0

(11)

the vanishing of this commutator comes directly from the physical requirement that for

bound states the gauge eld should be time-independent (0ai a = 0).

the result given in eq. (11) may seem strange, but an analogous result arises in the

electromagnetic system of a charge and monopole at rest with respect to one another. for

this electromagnetic system one can calculate the eld angular momentum as jem = egr/r,

where e, g, r are the electric charge, magnetic charge and displacement between the two

charges respectively. the commutator of the components of jem with itself gives zero since

r/r commutes with itself. alternatively, one could proceed in the electromagnetic case as

in the color eld case by writing jem out as in eq. (1) in terms of the normal electric

and magnetic elds. the commutator of the components of jem among themselves could

then be calculated using the electromagnetic version of the gauge potential commutators

given by eqs. (9) (10) with the color indices dropped. the only non-trivial terms would

come from commutators between 0ai and aj or jak. however, since the electric and

magnetic charges are at rest the gauge elds are time-independent so that 0ai = 0, and

one again nds that the commutator for the components of the electromagnetic eld angular

momentum with itself is zero. in the color eld case this latter method is the only viable one,

since for color interaction an explicit form for ea and ba is not known so that an explicit

calculation of jqcd is not possible. for the electromagnetic system e and b are coulomb

elds, and so jem can be calculated directly.

there are two possible ways of resolving the apparent conict between eqs. (2) and (11).

first, eqs. (2) and (11) are consistent if glueballs are restricted to be spin 0 (jgb = 0)

bound states. this is not an unreasonable restriction since the identication of the spin of

a non-zero spin glueball is usually based on some simplifying assumptions. as mentioned

previously spin 2 glueballs are usually connected with qcd operators like f a

f 

a or f a


f 
a .

however, one could instead associate these objects with two spin 0 glueballs in a d-wave

orbital angular momentum state. the choice of taking these operators to give one spin

8

2 glueball is a reasonable, simplifying assumption, but may not be correct in light of the

restriction coming from [j i

gb, j j

gb] = 0.

second, one could explain the zero commutator if glueballs did not occur as pure glue

bound states, but always had some admixture of quarks. if the glueball states were mixed

with qq states, these would contribute to the overall spin of the bound state. to take into

account a possible contribution coming from the quarks one would add the total quark

angular momentum operator [4]

~jq = z d3x(cid:20)1

2

~5 + (~x  (i ~d))(cid:21)

(12)

to the pure qcd term of eq.

(1)  ~jgb  ~jgb + ~jq.

(the two terms in eq.

(12)

are associated with the spin and orbital angular momentum of the quarks respectively).

this total angular momentum might then satisfy eq.

(2) with a non-zero term on the

right hand side. such mixing of quarks with glueballs is thought to be suppressed via the

1/nc expansion approach. however, the restriction coming from the angular momentum

commutators as discussed above, might be an indication that pure glue states can not exist

 that there will always be some substantial admixture of quarks in order to have the

correct angular momentum commutators. this postulated mixing required by the angular

momentum algebra might explain the diculty in experimentally distinguishing an object

as a pure glueball. this explanation for eq. (11) is also reminiscent of the electromagnetic

charge/monopole system, where it is only the sum of the eld angular momentum plus the

other contributions which satises eq. (2).

there are certain phenomenological bag models of glueballs [18] where the assumption

that the color elds are time independent is not true. in these models, to lowest order, the

chromoelectric and chromomagnetic elds are analogous to the ordinary electric and mag-

netic elds inside a resonant cavity so that the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic elds,

and the gauge potentials have oscillatory time-dependences. however the chromoelectric

and chromomagnetic elds are 90o out of phase with one another. therefore at some par-

ticular time the chromoelectric eld will be at a maximum while the chromomagnetic eld

9

is zero, and at some later time the chromomagnetic eld will be at a maximum while the

chromoelectric eld vanishes. at these times, when either ea or ba = 0, jgb = 0 from eq.

(1). since jgb is conserved (i.e.

is time independent) this implies that jgb = 0 at any

time. this vanishing of jgb was one of the possible resolutions that we arrived at by ap-

plying the angular momentum commutators to jgb and assuming that the elds were time

independent. thus, even in the phenomenological bag models where the time independence

assumption does not hold, we still nd the restriction jgb = 0. one can also present a more

general argument to support the time independence of the elds. since jgb is the total

angular momentum of the glueball system it must be conserved  djgb/dt = 0. from eq.

(1) this implies that

z d3x"x   dea

dt

 ba + ea 

dba

dt !# = 0

(13)

(x is not dierentiated since it is the time independent position vector from the origin to

some particular part of the momentum density, ea  ba). there are two simple ways in

which eq. (13) can be satised. first, if dea/dt = dba/dt = 0. this implies that the elds

are time independent which was the assumption in our analysis. second, if ea = ba then

eq. (13) is satised. however, in this case, even though the elds do not need to be time

independent, one nds that jgb = 0 from eq. (1). there is apparently no simple way to

have both jgb 6= 0 and dea/dt 6= 0, dba/dt 6= 0.

v. expectation of jgb

in this section we calculate the expectation value of j i

gb with respect to a glueball state,

|gi under certain simplifying assumptions. from eq. (7) the expectation value is given by

hg|j i

gb|gi = ilmz d3xhg|(cid:16)f 0n a(x)f m a

n (x)(cid:17) |gixl

(14)

the glueball state is taken to be normalized so that hg|gi = 1. since the eld angular

momentum operator in eq. (7) is gauge invariant we are free to chose a gauge without

10

eecting the physically measurable quantities like the spin of the glueball. we chose the

temporal gauge where aa

0 = 0.

in terms of the operator aa

0 we implement this gauge

choice using a gupta-bleuler-like approach by making it a condition on the glueball state 

hg|aa

0|gi = 0. aa

0 can be split into positive and negative frequency parts  aa

0 = aa(+)

0 +

aa()

0

. the positive frequency part can be written as a sum of annihilation operators, while

the negative frequency part can be written as a sum of creation operators. thus the gauge

condition hg|aa

0|gi = 0 becomes aa(+)

0

|gi = 0 and hg|aa()

0 = 0. next, since the glueball

is a bound state we have the physical (as opposed to gauge) restriction that 0aa

i = 0 which

we will also implement as a condition on the glueball state  hg|0aa

i |gi = 0. this can

also be written in terms of the positive and negative frequency parts as 0aa(+)

i

|gi = 0 and

hg|0aa()

i

= 0. expanding f 0n a in term of the gauge potentials we can write out a portion

of the right hand side of eq. (14) as

(cid:16)0ana(y)  na0a(y) + gf abca0b(y)anc(y)(cid:17) f m a

n

(x)|gi

(15)

by using the commutation rules for the non-abelian gauge potentials given by eq. (10)

we will move the various terms coming from f 0n a through f m a

n

and then apply either the

gauge condition aa(+)

0

|gi = 0 or the physical condition 0aa(+)

i

|gi = 0. in order to apply the

commutators of eq. (10) we have changed f 0n a(x) to f 0n a(y). in the end we will let y  x.

in eq. (15) f 0n a, expanded in terms of the aas, has both positive and negative frequency

parts, but the negative frequency parts will vanish directly when hg| is applied to the left

side of eq. (15). thus as we pull f 0n a through f m a

n we are only dealing with the positive

frequency parts even though the superscript (+) will not be written out explicitly. the last

term in f 0n a (gf abca0b(y)anc(y)) can be trivially commuted past f m a

n

(x) since both a0b(y)

and anc(y) commute with other gauge elds components or their spatial derivatives by the

last commutator in eq. (9). after this term is commuted through f m a

n

(x) one has

f m a

n

(x)[a0b(y)anc(y)]|gi  f m a

n

(x)[anc(y)a0b(y)]|gi = 0

(16)

where the gauge condition aa

0|gi = 0 was applied. the second term from eq. (15), na0a(y),

can also be commuted past f m a

n

(x) using the last commutator in eq. (9) since only a spatial

11

derivative is involved. this yields

f m a

n

(x)[na0a(y)]|gi = 0

(17)

where we have taken the gauge condition aa

0|gi = 0 to imply n(aa

0|gi) = 0. finally

we want to commute the term, 0ana(y) through f m a

n

(x). in order to do this we expand

f m a

n

(x) as

f m a

n

(x) = maa

n(x)  naa

m(x) + gf adeamd(x)ae

n(x)

(18)

from eq.

(9) [0ana(y), naa

m(x)] = imnn[3(y  x)] = 0 since here m 6= n. thus

0ana(y) trivially commutes with the naa

m(x) term from f m a

n

(x). also 0ana(y) will

trivially commute past both elds operators in the term f adeamd(x)ae

n(x). this is due to

a 6= d 6= e from the antisymmetry of f ade, and the kronecker delta in the group indices that

occurs in the commutator of eq. (9) (i.e. [0ana(y), ae

n(x)] = innae3(y  x) = 0 since

a 6= e). thus

0ana(y)naa

m(x)|gi  naa

m(x)(cid:16)0ana(y)|gi(cid:17) = 0

0ana(y)f adeamd(x)ae

n(x)|gi  f adeamd(x)ae

n(x)(cid:16)0ana(y)|gi(cid:17) = 0

(19)

where we have used the physical condition 0aa

i |gi = 0. finally we examine the last term,

0ana(y)maa

n(x)|gi. using the rst commutator in eq.

(10) (so 0ana(y)maa

n(x) =

maa

n(x)0ana(y)  im

(x)(3(x  y)) where the subscript (x) means that the derivative is

taken with respect to x rather than y). using this gives

0ana(y)maa

n(x)|gi = hmaa

n(x)0ana(y)  im

(x)(3(x  y))i |gi

= im

(x)(3(x  y))|gi

(20)

where the physical condition 0ana|gi = 0 was used in the last step. using eq. (20) one

can obtain

hg|j i

gb|gi = ilmz d3xhg|xl(im

(x)[3(x  y)])|gi = ilmz d3x(cid:16)im

(x)[3(x  y)](cid:17) xl (21)

12

where hg|gi = 1 was used. integrating eq. (21) by parts gives

 iilm[xl3(x  y)](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

+



+z 3(x  y)(m

(x)xl)d3x

(22)

the rst term above is zero because of the  function. the integral in the second term can

be evaluated using the  function. it equals the kronecker delta, ml. thus we can nally

write the expectation of j i

gb as

hg|j i

gb|gi = iilmml = iill = 0

(23)

using the properties of the s. thus by imposing the temporal gauge condition (aa(+)

0

|gi = 0

; hg|aa()

0 = 0) and the physical condition that for a bound state the gauge elds should be

time independent (0aia(+)|gi = 0 ; hg|0aia() = 0) it is found that hg|j i

gb|gi = 0.

vi. conclusions

by examining the commutation relationships ([j i

gb, j j

gb]) and the expectation value

(hg|j i

gb|gi) of the glueball angular momentum operator it was found that both of these

quantities were zero. the main assumption in both of these results was that the gauge elds

were time-independent (0aia = 0), since the glueball is a bound state. the non-abelian

nature of the gauge elds played little role in the commutation relationships of j i

gb, since the

group indices are traced over in the expression of j i

gb. thus one would expect that a similar

result ([j i

em , j j

em ] = 0 where j i

em is the electromagnetic eld angular momentum) should

hold for abelian gauge elds (a) under similar conditions (0ai = 0). for the two abelian

examples were this has been worked out explicitly (the monopole/charge system and the

magnetic dipole/charge system [9]) it is in fact found that the eld angular momentum, by

itself, does not satisfy the angular momentum commutation relationships. in light of these

abelian examples, and the similarity between j i

gb and j i

em the results for the glueball

angular momentum operator are not so surprising.

there are several possible resolutions/explanations for these results for j i

gb. first, the

fact that both [j i

gb, j j

gb] and hg|j i

gb|gi are zero may imply that pure glueballs can only

13

be spin 0. operators like f a

f 
a

are usually associated with spin 2 glueballs. however,

this association is based mostly on simplicity, since one could equally connect this operator

with two spin 0 glueballs in a relative d-state. second, the above results may indicate that

glueballs will always have some signicant admixture of quarks, which will play a major

role in the spin structure of the glueball. this is similar to electromagnetic systems with

static elds such as the charge/monopole or charge/magnetic dipole congurations.

in

these examples the eld angular momentum by itself does not satisfy the standard angular

momentum commutators. it is only the combination of eld plus particle angular momentum

which satises eq.

(2). given the similarity between the qed and qcd eld angular

momentum operators and the qed and qcd eld commutators, this may be the most

likely explanation. it may also be connected with the diculty in distinguishing pure glueball

states experimentally.

vii. acknowledgments

i would like to thank xiangdong ji who suggested this as a problem.

i also want to

thank gerardo munoz and dharam ahluwalia for discussions and comments on this paper.
