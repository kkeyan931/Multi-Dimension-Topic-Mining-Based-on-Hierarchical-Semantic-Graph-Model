(11) (12) (13) (14) noticed expression written linear combination constraints since p appears it. order perform analysis consistency condition eq.(12) useful consider rst situation recover usual interpretation degenerate metric space lower dimensionality. proceed general case. a. locally integrable case let us rst consider situation ea j] = 0 everywhere. easily nd line element reduces ds2 = dxadxbhab showing xa coordinates r-dimensional space. locally integrable, is, satises  + ea el  = 0, = (cid:16) ea ej ek b j ec (32) (33) solve = 0 given above. consider cases r even odd separately. r even general inverse (see footnote 1) lagrange multipliers determined = 0. constraints second class conguration space nd (d + r)/2 degrees freedom. equations motion xi gij pj , = xi 1 x = 0, pi obtain pi = 1 2m gj k pj pk.

(36) (37) therefore r 1 second class constraints one rst class constraint consistency gives constraints. 2d (d r 1) 2 = + r 1 degrees freedom phase space. iii. relativistic particle work space-time signature (, +, +, . . .). avoid problems interpretation degenerate metric time-like coordinate consider degeneracy space-like surfaces. world-line particle well dened. consider degenerate metric minimal rank 2. 8 action relativistic particle mass gravitational background described rst order formalism = z dt(cid:18) 1 2e g x x e 2 m2(cid:19) , e einbein. canonical momenta e x are, respectively, e = l e = 0, p = l x = e1g x. (38) (39) assuming metric degenerate nd one constraint e = 0. canonical hamiltonian easily found hc = e 2 (cid:16)ppg + m2(cid:17) , (40) consistency leads usual constraint p 2 + m2 = 0. constraints rst class canonical hamiltonian vanishes consequence reparametrization invariance action. metric degenerate invert velocities terms momenta. means new primary constraints appear. let us consider metric form g = ea ab ab = diag(1, +1, . . . , +1), , = 0, 1, . . . , 1, a, b = 0, 1, . . . , r1. easily veried determinant metric vanishes rank r. let us split range curved space indices , = 0, 1, . . . , r 1 , = r, . . . , 1. choice metric additional primary constraint. given eb = p ea e p , satises poisson bracket algebra n, = m, = p (cid:18) (cid:19) ,  h . canonical hamiltonian given ] h c cd (cid:16)(cid:17) , hc = e 2 (cid:16) p 2 + m2(cid:17) , p 2 = g pp , g = ab e e b . follows primary hamiltonian 9 (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) e hp = 2 (cid:16) p 2 + m2(cid:17) + e + , lagrange multipliers primary constraints. consistency primary constraints result secondary constraint consistency condition = 1 2 (cid:16) p 2 + m2(cid:17) , n + = 0. (47) (48) (49) notice consistency e results constraint analogous usual case important dierence p appears form similar non-relativistic case. assuming n vanish consider, non-relativistic particle case, two situations depending parity r. eq.(49) lagrange multiplier case r even inverse exists (see footnote 1) solve = nm . (50) r + 1 second class constraints, is, odd number them. means must exist rst class constraints among them. nd let us take linear combination impose rst class. nd = f + f , 2 e f n = 0, f n + f = 0. 2 e solution equations f = nm , f = e 2 . rst class constraint given = e 2 + n. (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) therefore r second class constraints one rst class constraint . gives + r 2 degrees freedom phase space. case r odd inverse m. proceeding non-relativistic case select last component eq.(49) using notation = (, r), = 1, ..., r 1. solve nding 10 = (cid:16)n + mdrdr(cid:17) , (57) assuming inverse (see footnote 1). component r eq(49) gives new constraint = ndr mdr n. set constraints e, . time evolution get dr = e 2 {, } + nn, (cid:16)n, dro mdrn, o(cid:17) . (58) (59) sure denominator eq.(59) vanish consider null eigenvector m. easily found v = dr mdr . (60) nd denominator eq.(59) written v {, } non- vanishing. found lagrange multipliers dr determined. therefore constraints second class. nd class constraint belongs to. following steps non-relativistic case consider extended hamiltonian h = e 2 + + . using evaluate time evolution constraints nd = {, } + {, } = 2 e n 2 e drndr + {, } = 0, = e 2{, } + {, } = 0, = n + + drm dr + {, } = 0, dr = ndr + mdr + {dr, } = 0. eq.(64) get = (cid:16)n + drmdr + {, }(cid:17) . (61) (62) (63) (64) (65) (66) eq.(65) get = 0 eq.(63) nd result already found eq.(59). finally eq.(65) vanishes identically. therefore lagrange multipliers associated 11 constraints determined showing second class. also {, } = 2 e n 6= 0, (67) also second class. gives odd number second class constraints r odd. implies must exist combination rst class. nd rst class combination let us denote set second class constraints () = (cid:16), , (cid:17) = (cid:16)(a), (b), ()(cid:17) , (68) matrix poisson brackets () () () = {(), ()} det = 0. null eigenvector , satises w ()() () = 0, w () = () (dr) (dr) ()() ( )() ( ). imposing following linear combination () = w ()(), rst class results (69) (70) = dr ndr, ()o () ( )( ). second class constraints , one rst class constraint + r 5 degrees freedom phase space.

(84) (85) (86) secondary constraints generate new constraints. usual constraints rst class close virasoro algebra. let us consider degenerate metric rank r set form g = ea eb ab a, b = 0, 1 . . . r 1. relativistic particle case consider degeneracy space-like directions. primary constraint eq.(82) still momenta eq.(81) longer inverted velocities. following development relativistic particle split space-time indices , according , = 0, 1, ..., r 1 , = r, ..., 1. allows dene inverse ea square matrix e . then, besides constraint eq.(82) primary constraints written = p ea e ap , p = aea , = 0(b)(b)xeb ab. notice write constraint = u u = p, ea e , showing metric g r null eigenvectors u canonical hamiltonian eq.(84) rewritten g = 0. hc = 1 2h00 " (h)1/2 p 2 + 2h01px + (h)1/2x 2# , p 2 = g e e x2 = xxg = xxea eb pp = ac cpp , ab. (87) (88) (89) (90) (91) (92) build primary hamiltonian used nd consistency conditions primary constraints. given 14 hp = z (cid:16)hc + (a)(b)p(a)(b) + (cid:17) d, (93) (a)(b) lagrange multipliers. obtain secondary constraints 1 = 1 px , 2 = 1 2 p 2 2 + x 2! . allows canonical hamiltonian eq.(91) rewritten hc = h00 h(h)1/22 + h011i . (94) (95) (96) also constraint algebra obtained. 1 2 obtain usual virasoro algebra {1(), 1()} =  ( ), {1(), 2()} =  ( ), {2(), 2()} =  ( ), {(), ()} = ()( ), {(), 1()} = ()( ), {(), 2()} = n()( ), get = p e b () + peb ea e b () e b () + p e ]e b eb (), n() = 2 pa pdcd gx u e c ()(cid:20)() eb gx x e b ()(cid:21) consistency requires n() + () = 0, 15 (97) (98) (99) (100) (101) (102) (103) (104) (105) n() = c()n() c() = /(2hh00). result similar non-relativistic relativistic particles. consider separately cases r even odd. 1) eq.(105) solved lagrange multiplier let us assume n 6= 0. r even exists inverse (see footnote = n.
