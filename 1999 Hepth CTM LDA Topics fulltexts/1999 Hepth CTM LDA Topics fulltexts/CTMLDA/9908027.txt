come question fractional statistics, might worthwhile understand unlike three higher space dimensions, eigenvalue spin angular momentum operator take fractional value units h. point spin two dimensions diers fundamentally spin higher dimensions. whereas three higher space dimensions, spin angular momentum algebra non-commutative i.e.  = ihijksk ; i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 (1) two space dimensions, trivial commutative algebra since one generator (say s3) available obviously commutes itself. result, analogue quantization angular momentum, arises three higher space dimensions nonlinear com- mutation relation (1). ijk completely antisymmetric tensor. now, relativistic quantum eld theory, deep profound connection spin statistics i.e. particles half integer spin fermions, satisfying fermi-dirac statistics, integer spin bosons, satisfying bose-einstein statistics. immediately sug- gests two dimensions particles may exhibit fractional (i.e. any) statistics. remarkable paper leinaas myrheim  showed indeed so. come proper discussion statistics, worth clarifying exactly one means quantum statistics. text books statistical mechanics, term quantum statistics refers phase picked wave function two identical particles in- terchanged, i.e, permutation particles. slightly misleading correctly criticized literature . par- ticles strictly identical, word permutation physical meaning since given conguration one obtained permutation particle coordinates merely two dierent ways describing particle conguration. term quantum statistics actually refers phase arises two particles adiabatically transported giving rise exchange. book, shall concentrating denition quantum statistics. coincidence three higher dimensions, two denitions, based permutation adiabatic exchange 4 two particles, coincide, two dimensions two denitions give dierent answers. key reason fractional statistics two dimensions prin- ciple indistinguishability identical particles. one im- portant characteristics quantum mechanics (vis vis classical mechanics) profound physical consequences. principle fact older quantum mechanics. introduced john willard gibbs even classical statistical mechanics resolve famous gibbs paradox. even though principle us long time, unfortunately, full signicance appreciated till 1977 one missed possibility fractional statistics two dimensions years. following leinaas myrheim , let us enquire conguration space system identical particles ? normally one considers full phase space statistical mechanics turns conguration space enough discussion. suppose one particle space x. conguration space n identical particles ? naive answer x n , which, even though true locally, correct globally. why? reason is, since particles strictly identical, hence distinction points x n dier ordering particle coordinates. example, consider point x = (x1, x2, ..., xn ) (2) x n xi x = 1, 2, ..., n. consider another point x x n obtained x permutation p particle indices i.e. x = p (x) = (xp 1(1), ..., xp 1(n )) . (3) clearly, describe physical conguration system. thus true conguration n-particle system x n space x n /sn obtained identifying points x n represent obtained x n dividing physical conguration, i.e. action symmetry group sn . note sn discrete, nite group obtained permutation n identical particles. result, space x n /sn locally isomorphic x n except singular points. however, global properties two spaces dierent. whereas x n regular points x regular, points x n /sn correspond coincidence positions two particles 5 fact singular points x n /sn . thus calculate conguration space identical particles, singular points must excluded say hard-core constraint determine two particles exchanged not. course make much dierence classically. however, quantum case global properties conguration space deep signicance results possibility fractional statistics. worth emphasizing crux whole matter fact missed fty years! turns removal singular point two space dimen- sions makes space multiply connected three higher space dimensions still doubly connected. why, two dimensions possible dene paths wind around origin arbitrary number times counted orientation. consequence, one quantizes system identical particles one show two dimensions possible consistently assign value phase arising due exchange two identical particles. since two dimensions one distin- guish clockwise winding anti-clockwise winding, hence without loss generality one assign phases e+i ei respectively, case anti-clockwise clockwise windings. point, may worthwhile mention key properties anyons. 1. anyons must necessarily violate discrete symmetries parity (p) time reversal (t) 0 < < since clockwise anti- clockwise windings dierent phase factors. 2. anyons sort bosons fermions i.e. repulsion two anyons ground state monotonically in- creases goes 0 repulsion two bosons. thus, sense, anyons closer fermions bosons since satisfy generalized form pauli exclusion principle. 3. turns whereas permutation group heart bose-einstein fermi-dirac statistics, braid group heart fractional statistics. particular, whereas two one dimensional representations permutation group 6 (the identical one alternating one, corresponding bose- einstein fermi-dirac statistics respectively), braid group ad- mits continuous parameter family one dimensional representations one usually identies parameter characterizes fractional statistics. 4. relation anyonic statistics parastatistics ? answer no. built two dierent structures i.e. whereas parastatistics corresponds higher dimensional rep- resentation permutation group anyons correspond one dimensional representation braid group. quantum statistics one dimension since talking possible quantum statistics var- ious dimensions, hence may worthwhile also talk various possibilities one dimension. recall notion spin exist one dimension since axis rotate case. similarly concept quantum statistics uniquely dened one dimension since position two particles cannot interchanged without passing one another. result, intrinsic statistics in- extricably mixed local interactions. fact ambiguity heart bosonization technique allows particle represented alternatively boson fermion eld. if, however, statistics dened terms exclusion principle rather exchange identical particles, possible dene quantum statistics even one dimension . 3 introduction chern-simons term want understand anyons occur eld theory. turns possible provided cs term incarnation, hopf term present. may therefore worthwhile rst introduce cs term (in 2+1 dimensions) discuss various properties . chern-simons term? consider lagrangian density classical electrodynamics 3+1 di- 7 mensions given l = 1 4 ff + (id m) (4) f = = iea covariant derivative. lagrangian invariant local gauge transformation (x) eie(x)(x) , a(x) a(x) + (x) . (5) similarly, massless fermions (m=0), lagrangian also invariant un- der (global) chiral transformation (x) ei5(x) , a(x) a(x) . (6) naive expectation that, two symmetries i.e. gauge chiral symmetries, valid classical level, continue hold good even quantum theory. consequence, one expected vector axial vector currents j = j5 = 5 conserved classical level, continue remain conserved even quantum theory. however, shown so. regularization simultaneously preserve symmetries quantum level. unexpected result, called anomaly time (and unfortunately even today called so), even though correct name quantum mechanical symmetry breaking. remarkably, entire eect comes one loop diagram two higher loops contribute anomaly. view strong faith gauge symmetry, one therefore says chiral symmetry broken one loop quantum corrections. particular, gauge singlet (axial) anomaly even dimen- sion, (2n) divergence gauge singlet axial current, even massless fermions, non-zero proportional corresponding chern- pontryagin (cp) density p2n (even) dimension 2n i.e. j5 (x) p2n . (7) also well known cp density always written total divergence p2n = , = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2n 1 . (8) 8 object , particular value (say = 2n-1) naturally lives odd (2n 1) dimensions known cs density dimension. thus, whereas cp density lives even space-time dimensions, cs density lives odd space-time dimensions. example, gauge singlet anomaly 3+1 dimensional quantum electrodynamics given j5 = e2 2 f f = e2 (af ) abelian cs term 2+1 dimensions given jcs = z lcs d3x z d3x af . (9) (10) throughout book shall mainly concerned cs term non-abelian generalization. let us therefore discuss detail various properties term. gauge invariant mass term let us consider pure electrodynamics presence chern-simons term 2+1 dimensions  l = 1 4 ff + 4 fa . (11) since mass dimension 1/2, hence follows parameter dimension mass. eld equation following lagrangian written (g + )f = 0 (12) 1 f dual eld strength vector 2+1 dimensions i.e. f = 1 2 f ; f = f . (13) thus nd that, unlike cp term nontrivial topol- ogy dynamics (being total divergence), cs term nontrivial topology well dynamics it. operating (g 1 ) eq. (12), get (2 + 2)f = 0 (14) clearly shows gauge eld excitations massive gauge eld mass coecient cs term. thus shown 9 cs term added maxwell term, acts gauge invari- ant gauge eld mass term. worth adding remarkable property gauge invariant mass term gauge eld action special 2+1 dimensions. behavior c, p, let us consider behaviour cs term well dirac la- grangian ld = i( m) (15) discrete transformations c (charge conjugation), p (parity) (time reversal). here, two component spinor mass m(> 0) mass dimension 1. use following two-dimensional realization dirac algebra 0 = 3 , 1 = i1 , 2 = i2 , = g ; g = diag.(1,1,1) usual pauli matrices. easily shown charge conjugation cac 1 = , cc 1 = 1+ (16) (17) (18) action invariant c. hand, parity transformation, gauge fermi elds transform follows p a0,2(t, r)p 1 = a0,2(t, r) , p a1(t, r)p 1 = a1(t, r) , p (t, r)p 1 = 1(t, r) . (19) (20) note 2+1 dimensions, parity transformation somewhat unusual i.e. r = (x, y), r = (x, y) (or (x,y)). hand, (x,y) corresponds rotation (and space reection). result, nd mass terms fermi gauge elds (i.e. cs term) invariant parity. similarly, time-inversion changes signs mass terms since a0(t, r)t 1 = a0(t, r) , a(t, r)t 1 = a(t, r) , (t, r)t 1 = 2(t, r) . 10 (21) (22) thus, cs term well fermion mass term, non- invariant p well . however, invariant com- bined operation p hence cp symmetry still valid. note 3 + 1 dimensions though, invariant p, c separately. finally, let us talk photon spin. one show cs photon spin 1(1) cs mass > 0(< 0) spin massless photon zero. further, either case, photon one degree freedom. coleman - hill theorem turns p violating gauge invariant cs term, general form vacuum polarization tensor consistent lorentz gauge invariance general dimensions i.e. (k) = (k2g kk)1(k2) ik2(k2) . (23) note second term right hand side odd p . clear p violating interaction contribute 2(k2). example, fermion mass term violates p , contribute 2(k2) one loop. remarkably enough, discovered two loops, however, contribution 2(0) hence chern- simons mass . inspired result, coleman hill  fact proved general conditions 2(0) receives contribution two higher loops gauge lorentz invariant theory including particles spin 1 less (an open question whether also valid higher spin theories, specially spin-3/2). require matter elds massive one worry infrared problems. further, also assume part free electro-magnetic lagrangian density hiding matter part lagrangian. may noted result valid even non-renormalizable interactions presence gauge lorentz invariant regularization. coleman hill also claimed one loop, contribution 2(0) come fermion loop. is, however, incorrect. particular, reason p violating interactions involving spin-0 spin-1 particles contribute 2(0) one loop. fact, shown parity violating spin-0  well spin-1 interactions  contribute 2(0) one loop. magneto-electric eect 11 many crystals nature like chromium oxide, show magneto-electric eect i.e., also get magnetically polarized electric eld electrically polarized magnetic eld . well known eect depends upon cp -asymmetric medium. mathemat- ically, signal magneto-electric eect 2+1 dimensions relation excitation elds h e b modied di = (e) ij ej + (em) b ; h = (m)b + (me) ei . (24) (me) shown  vacuum 2 + 1 dimensional quantum electrodynamics cs term also shows magneto-electric eect. particular, shown (em) non-zero proportional ki2(k2). course really surprising one re- members cs term violates discrete symmetries p . chern-simons term spontaneous symmetry breaking seen cs term provides mass gauge eld. now, usually gauge eld mass generated spontaneous symmetry breaking; hence worth enquiring whether cs term also gen- erated spontaneous symmetry breaking. answer question yes . because, unlike dimensions, 2 + 1 case, one general denition covariant derivative. particular, easily seen = ( iea igf ) (25) also transforms covariant derivative, since eld strength f gauge invariant. obviously, thing also true spin-0 charged scalar eld. consider following generalized abelian higgs model 2 + 1 dimensions l = 1 4 ff + 1 2 (d)(d) (| |2 a2)2 (26) generalized covariant derivative given eq. (25). ex- panding term 1 2(d)(d), 1 2 (d)(d) = ( + iea)( iea) + 1 ff | |2 2 +ig f( ) + eg(a)a | |2 g2 4 (27) 12 acquires nonzero vacuum expectation value abelian cs term generated last term equation. clearly similar mechanism also work non-abelian case, technically tougher problem since one also generate non-linear term. lorentz invariance gauge invariance one remarkable properties abelian cs term case lorentz invariance action automatically follows gauge invariance. contrast, notice general form gauge in- variant maxwell lagrangian classical electrodynamics 3 + 1 dimensions (28) demand lorentz invariance tell us = 1 (in 2 + 1 case, b pseudo scalar argument still valid). hand, one writes cs action l = e2 + ab2 . ics = z d3x , (29) demand invariance ics gauge transformation + xes uniquely gives us cs action auto- matically also lorentz invariant. quantization chern-simons mass let us discuss cs term non-abelian gauge theories. shall mention properties special non-abelian cs term. begin with, notice non-abelian cs term extra term compared abelian case i.e. (cs) na = 4 z d3x tr(fa 2 3 aaa) (30) f matrices = gt aaa ; f = gt af = +  . (31) here, representation matrices gauge group g satisfying  = f abct c (32) f abc structure constants group. case su(2), = a/2i. 13 let us consider non-abelian gauge theory chern-simons term given lna = 1 2g2 tr(f f) 2g2 tr(fa 2 3 aaa) (33) abelian case, easily shown cs term provides gauge invariant gauge eld mass . abelian case, non-abelian cs lagrangian density changes total derivative innitesimal local gauge transformation corresponding action invariant gauge transformation. however, cs action invariant nite (also called homotopically non-trivial, continuously deformable identity) gauge transformations given u 1au + u 1u . (34) result, one nds action corresponding lagrangian (33) transforms follows ina ina + z d3x tr(cid:18)(cid:19) 3 z d3x tr(cid:20)(u)u 1(u)u 1(u)u 1(cid:21) . + (35) let us consider gauge transformations tend identity temporal spatial innity avoid convergence problem i.e. u(x) x . (36) easily seen gauge eld dependent surface integral eq. (35) vanishes. however, last term integral non-zero. converted surface integral integrand rewritten total derivative. made manifest using explicit parameterization u. example, case su(2) (more generally, choose su(2) sub-group gauge group g; reasons clear soon), one make use exponential parameterization u(x) = exp(iaa(x)). way one show large gauge transformations, ina invariant transforms ina ina + 82 g2 (u) 14 (37) (u) = 1 242 z d3x tr(cid:20)(u)u 1(u)u 1(u)u 1(cid:21) (38) winding number gauge transformation u. particular, gauge group g third homotopy group g non-trivial i.e. 3(g) = z (39) z additive group integers, called large gauge transformations, action transforms ina ina + 82 g2 (40) integer. note particular, eq.

(41) mass quantization reminiscent famous dirac quantization case magnetic monopole. important question address whether quantization condition (41) respected quantum corrections. issue considered pisarski rao  case pure gauge theory (i.e. without matter eld). found quantization indeed preserved one loop; however, integer right hand side eq.
