abstract

we study possible relations between the full green functions of softly broken
supersymmetric theories and the full green functions of rigid supersymmetric
theories on the example of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics and nd that
algebraic relations exist and can be written in a simple form. these algebraic
relations between the green functions have been derived by transforming the
path integral of the rigid theory.
in this approach soft terms appear as the
berezinians of general changes of coordinates in the superspace.

the renormalization of softly broken supersymmetric yang-millls theories in four
spacetime dimensions into the framework of the supereld technique and spurions
method was studied from dierent points of view in refs. ([1]-[6]). the soft terms
were introduced as the nite series in terms of grassmanian coordinates of the su-
perspace. it results in dependence of renormalization constants of the theory on the
grassmanian coordinates. as it was understood, there are direct relations between the
renormalization constants of the rigid theory  theory without soft terms  and the
renormalization constants of its softly broken counterpart. the rst investigation in
this direction was performed by yamada [1] and it was developed in [4, 5], where simple
rules to calculate these constants starting from well-known results for the rigid theory
have been derived. these rules are realized in terms of dierential operators acting in
the coupling space of the rigid theory. in the ref.[5] it was found that this approach
is in good agreement with nonperturbative results [2]. the reason why these rules
exist is that the soft breaking terms can be considered as background x-independent
superelds [5, 6] in which our theory is embedded. these external superelds must
be substituted into innite parts of the green functions instead of the couplings of
the rigid theory. the algebraic relations between the renormalizations constants are
consequences of these substitutions [5].

however, it would be nice to have relations for the complete green functions of the
theory that includes soft terms and for its counterpart without them. here we nd
these relations for the case of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics as the easiest
example where the method proposed below can work. the supersymmetric quantum
mechanics was developed in ([7]-[9]) and its action is 3

sr = z dxdd(cid:16)d d + v ()(cid:17) ,

(1)

where v is an arbitrary function of the real supereld ,

(cid:16)x, , (cid:17) = (x) + i(x) + i (x) +  d(x),  = .

the lagrangian (1) is the only thing of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics
we need. in the rest of this letter we work with the path integral produced by this
classical action. the green functions of it are referred in what follows as the rigid
green functions:

gr

n (cid:16)x1, x2, . . . , xn, , (cid:17) =





j(x1, , )

j(x2, , )

. . .



j(xn, , )

z r[j],

z r[j] = z d exp(cid:18)sr +z dxddj(cid:19).

some comments about this expression are necessary. the green functions are local
in the grassmanian -coordinates [10]. the external source j is also real supereld,

3here superscript r stands for rigid

j  = j. the covariant derivatives in the action (1) are dened as

d =




 i


x

,

d =



 




+ i


x

.

polynomials in grassmanian coordinates which are background x-independent super-
elds can stand in front of the terms of the action (1),

ss = r dxdd(cid:16)p1(, )d d + p2(, )v ()(cid:17) ,

pi(, ) = i + ii + i i  + i , p 

i = pi.

(2)

in this case we say
here i, i, and i are arbitrary numbers, i is grassmanian.
that there is a soft supersymmetry breaking since if we do not transform charges in a
proper way we have non-invariance of the component action under the supersymmetry
transformations caused by the change of coordinates in superspace

our purpose is to show a way in which the rigid green functions and the soft green
functions,

j(x1, , )

j(x2, , )

. . .



j(xn, , )

z s[j],

z s[j] = z d exp(cid:18)ss +z dxddj(cid:19),

can be related. first of all, let us suppose that a general change of the superspace
coordinates is made,

x = x(x, ,

),

 = (x, ,

),

 = (x, ,

),

and we look for changes which satisfy the conditions

d(cid:16)x  i(cid:17) = 0, d(cid:16)x + i(cid:17) = 0,

d  = 0, d

 = 0,

x = x,

where we suppose that we know the reversed law of the transformation (4)

x = x(x, , ),

 = (x, , ),

 =

(x, , ).

the conditions (5) mean that the covariant derivative transforms as

d =




 i


x

 (cid:16)d (cid:17)  

 


 i



 x! ,

and d transforms in the hermitian conjugated way. the most general change of
superspace coordinates that satisfy the condition (5) is

x = g(x) + if (x)qg(x) + if (x)qg(x)  f 2(x) 

 = qg(x  i ) + f (x  i )
 = qg(x + i ) + f (x + i ),

where the functions f and g are arbitrary and  is a grassmanian dimensionful con-
stant. it is clear that if we want to have the berezinian of this change of the superspace
coordinates as the external background supereld with constants as its component
elds, we should take g(x) = x and keep f (x) arbitrary for a moment. then the form
of the above transformation is

x = x + if (x) + if (x)  f 2(x) 

 =  + f (x  i )
 =  + f (x + i ).

the change of coordinates reversed to (7) is

x = x  if (x)  i

f (x)  f 2(x)

)
 =  (1 + if 2(x))  f (x  i
 =  (1  if 2(x))  f (x + i).

the berezinian of this change is

(cid:17)
ber = exp(cid:16)f 2(x)

(7)

(8)

(9)

and it is x-independent background supereld if f (x) = x. in this case, the transfor-
mation (7) is

x = x(cid:16)1 + i + i  2 (cid:17) = x(cid:16)1  i  i(cid:17)1

 =  + (x  i )
 =  + (x + i ),

and the reversed transformation is

x = x(cid:16)1 + i + i

(cid:17)1

)(cid:17) exp(2i)
 = (cid:16)  (x  i
 = (cid:16)  (x + i)(cid:17) exp(2i).

the factors d  and d that come from (6) are
  (x + i
d  = exp(cid:16)2i(cid:17) = exp(cid:16)2i[
 = exp (2i) = exp(cid:16)2i[  (x  i

d

)](cid:17) ,
)](cid:17) .

we can make the change of coordinates (11) in the rigid action sr of the path

integral z r:

z r[j] = z d exp(cid:18)z dxdd[d d + v () + j](cid:19) =
= z d  exp(cid:18)z dxdd[exp(2i + 2i + 2 )d  d +

+exp(2 )v ( ) + j ](cid:17) = z s[ j ],

where the denitions are used:

(13)

(x, , ) =  
j(x, , ) = e2  j

, (cid:16)  (x  i )(cid:17) e2i , (cid:16)  (x + i )(cid:17) e2i ! .

in the expression (13) we collected all the factors from (9) and (12) in front of the
terms of the rigid action (1).

as one can see the second part of (13) is the path integral of the theory with soft

supersymmetry breaking terms that correspond according to (2) to

p1(, ) = 1 + 2i + 2i  2 

p2(, ) = 1  2 .

(14)

we can expand this soft path integral z s in terms of the external source j and the
coecient functions of this expansion are in fact the green functions of the soft theory

z s[ j ] = xn z dx1dx2 . . . dxndd

n(cid:16)x1, x2, . . . , xn, , (cid:17) 

 j(x1, , ) j(x2, , ) . . . j(xn, , )

(15)

now we can make the change of coordinates back and restore the original sources j. it
means that by changing as in (10) for each of xi we have instead of (15) the expression

z s[ j[j]] = xn z dx1dx2 . . . dxndd

(16)

as one can see from (13), the expansion (16) is at the same time the expansion of
the z r[j] in terms of the external source of the rigid theory j. therefore, the following
equality takes place

thus, the nal result is that the theory with soft supersymmetry breaking terms
(2) in the form (14) is equivalent to the rigid theory (1) in the sense of the relation (17)
between their green functions. it looks like something surprising that we could relate
soft and rigid theories, but the explanation is if we amount couplings to background
x-independent superelds we have their transformations at the level of the component
action which are the reection of the change of coordinates in the superspace (3).
hence, if we treat couplings of theory at the component level as components of an
external background multiplet, we have no supersymmetry breaking since we include
rigid couplings and soft couplings in the supersymmetry transformation (3).

in this letter we considered only the case of the universal supersymmetry breaking
when there is a common soft factor in front of every term of the superpotential in
(2). the case of non-universal factors is more complicated but these complications are
only technical.
