abstract

we study toric singularities of the form of c4/ for nite abelian groups   su(4).
in particular, we consider the simplest case  = z2  z2  z2 and nd explicitly charge
matrices for partial resolutions of this orbifold by extending the method by morrison and
plesser. we obtain three kinds of algebraic equations, z1z2z3z4 = z2
4z5 and
z1z2z5 = z3z4 where zis parametrize c5. when we put n d1 branes at this singularity,
it is known that the eld theory on the worldvolume of n d1 branes is t-dual to 222
brane cub model. we analyze geometric interpretation for eld theory parameters and
moduli space.

1 introduction

in [1] the large n limit of superconformal eld theories (scft) was described by taking
the supergravity limit on anti-de sitter (ads) space. the scaling dimensions of operators
of scft were obtained from the masses of particles in string/m theory [2]. in particular,
n = 4 su(n) super yang-mills theory in 4 dimensions is described by type iib string
theory on ads5  s5. this ads/cft correspondence can be tested by studying the
kaluza-klein (kk) states of supergravity theory and by comparing them with the chiral
primary operators of the scft on the boundary. there exist also n = 2, 1, 0 conformal
theories in 4 dimensions which have corresponding supergravity description on orbifolds
[3, 4] of ads5  s5 [5].

on the other hand, t duality transforms orbifold singularity into ns5 branes and
d3 branes into d4 branes. brane box model [6] is connected by d3 branes at c3/
singularity, through t duality. by extending this idea to three kinds of ns5 branes, it
was found [7] that d1 branes, obtained from d4 branes by t duality, at c4/ singularities
with  an abelian subgroup of su(4) are related to brane cub model. they discussed
their method by comparing the result of [8] where (0, 2) gauge theory on the worldvolume
of d1 branes at the singular point of calabi-yau fourfold was studied.

in this paper, we generalize the work of [9] where d branes are on the non orbifold
singularities to the case of toric singularities of c4/ for nite abelian groups   su(4)
where we consider the simplest case  = z2  z2  z2. one of the singularities classied
in [9] is so called conifold singularity which plays an important role in the d brane
worldvolume theory. see the relevant papers [10, 11, 12]. in section 2, we nd explicitly
charge matrices for partial resolutions of this orbifold and obtain three kinds of algebraic
equations. in section 3, we consider 2 2 2 brane cub model which is dual to the eld
theory on the worldvolume of n d1 branes. in section 4, we study vacuum moduli space
of d1 branes which is a toric variety. finally in section 5, we will discuss important open
problems and comment on the future directions.

2 toric singularities

before going to our present problems, we review the result of [9] in our context and see
how it appears. if we let  = zn  zn act on c3 through the generators

(2.1)

diag(e2i/n, e2i/n, 1),

diag(e2i/n, 1, e2i/n),

then the quotient singularity c3/ is described by the polygons with vertices (0, 0), (n, 0)
and (0, n). the vectors consist of all integer vectors (k, l) with k  0, l  0 and k +l  n.

1

in the simplest case of z2  z2, we label the vectors as follows [9]:

v0 = (0, 0), v1 = (2, 0), v2 = (0, 2)
w0 = (1, 1), w1 = (0, 1), w2 = (1, 0).

(2.2)

then the charge matrix in terms of homogeneous coordinates x0, x1, x2, y0, y1, y2 be-
comes

x0 x1 x2 y0

.

the moment map is given by

|x0|2 + |y0|2  |y1|2  |y2|2 = 1,
|x1|2  |y0|2 + |y1|2  |y2|2 = 2,
|x2|2  |y0|2  |y1|2 + |y2|2 = 3.

(2.3)

(2.4)

from now on we use slightly dierent bases unlike as [9] because our presentation will
be more clear for the higher dimensional generalization and will lead to same result near
the region of singularities. the vectors are

w0 = (0, 0),
u0 = (1, 1), w1 = (1, 0), w2 = (0, 1).

v1 = (2, 0),

v2 = (0, 2)

(2.5)

from this, the charge matrix is given by and we denote its relation to those of [9] as
follows:





t0 = y0 x1 = x1 x2 = x2 y0 = x0 y1 = y2 y2 = y1

then the moment map is

|t0|2 + |y0|2  |y1|2  |y2|2 = 1 = 1,
|x1|2 + |y0|2  2|y1|2 = 2 = 1 + 2,
|x2|2 + |y0|2  2|y2|2 = 3 = 1 + 3.

(2.7)

now it is easy to see that all four types classied by the variable i [9] are exactly the
same as those by the variable i here: z2  z2 orbifold corresponds to 1 = 2 = 3 = 0,
suspended pinch point to 1 = 2 = 0, conifold to 1 = 0 and z2 orbifold to 2 = 0.
furthermore, 2 = 3 = 0 leads to z2  z2 orbifold. note that alternative description
for this space were done in [13, 14].

now we move on one higher dimensional case and let  = zn  zn  zn act on c4

through the generators

diag(e2i/n, e2i/n, 1, 1), diag(e2i/n, 1, e2i/n, 1) and diag(e2i/n, 1, 1, e2i/n),(2.8)

then the quotient singularity c4/ is described by the polygons with vertices

(0, 0, 0),

(n, 0, 0),

(0, n, 0) and (0, 0, n).

(2.9)

a toric gorenstein canonical singularity of complex dimension 4 is a convex polygon
in r3 whose vertices have integer coordinates. let all the vectors in r3 have integer
coordinates and lie in either the interior or the boundary of the polygons. the set of
vectors consist of all integer vectors (k, l, m) with k  0, l  0, m  0 and k + l + m  n.
in the case of z2  z2  z2, let us label 10 vectors as follows:
w0 = (0, 0, 0),
v2 = (0, 2, 0),
w1 = (1, 0, 0), w2 = (0, 1, 0), w3 = (0, 0, 1),
u1 = (0, 1, 1), u2 = (1, 0, 1), u3 = (1, 1, 0).

v3 = (0, 0, 2),

v1 = (2, 0, 0),

(2.10)

these vectors are drawed in fig1(a). the linear relations between these vectors with
integer coecients qj are

(2.11)

(2.12)

let ~q1,   , ~q6 be a basis for the set of all such relations and use the matrix (qj
i ) to spec-
ify the charges in a representation of u(1)6 on c10 where 6 = the number of vectors 
complex dimension = 10  4. then the singular space is the symplectic reduction
c10//u(1)6. partial and complete resolutions of this singularity can be obtained by
changing the center of moment map.

obviously the sum of the elements of each row vanishes according to (2.12). for conve-
nience, we write the 10 vectors in the 1st row and homogeneous coordinates in the 2nd
one. the moment map is

|t1|2 + |y0|2  |y2|2  |y3|2 = 1,

4

|t2|2 + |y0|2  |y1|2  |y3|2 = 2,
|t3|2 + |y0|2  |y1|2  |y2|2 = 3,
|x1|2 + |y0|2  2|y1|2 = 4,
|x2|2 + |y0|2  2|y2|2 = 5,
|x3|2 + |y0|2  2|y3|2 = 6.

(2.14)

when is are generic, the symplectic reduction is smooth. there are various singularity
types for specic values of the is. some of these are illustrated in fig1(b,c,d). each
singularity is related to a subgroup u(1)k of u(1)6 such that at least 6 k of the homo-
geneous coordinates are uncharged under the u(1)k. the singular space is described by
symplectic reduction of the space of ck+4 spanned by the remaining k + 4 homogeneous
coordinates by u(1)k. we list in table 1., write the condition on d-term coecients
and the corresponding charge matrix on the remaining k + 4 homogeneous coordinates.
starting from the case i) corresponding to vanishing of all is and then move on the
case in which ve is are vanishing: there are two cases whether the remaining nonzero
j are either 1, 2, 3 or 4, 5, 6. note that the charge matrix (2.13) is characterized by
two parts: upper 3  10 matrix elements and lower 3  10 ones. so there are two cases
on ii): ii-a) and ii-b). the charge matrix for ii-a) can be read o from i) by removing
both 6th row and column. we can continue all the other cases and end up v i). some
of polygons corresponding to the relevant homogeneous coordinates are given in fig1.
as mentioned in the paper of [9], in our case also we can consider ecient description
of the singularity possessing fewer elds and smaller group. we do not pursue this issue
here.

3 branes at a z2  z2  z2 singularity

brane congurations [7] of ns5, ns5, ns5 and d4 branes in type iia string theory
are

2 ns5 branes along (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5),
2 ns5 branes along (x0, x1, x2, x3, x6, x7),
2 ns5 branes along (x0, x1, x4, x5, x6, x7),
n d4 branes along (x0, x1, x2, x4, x6)

(3.1)

where d4 branes are nite in the direction (x2, x4, x6). they are bounded in the direction
x2 by the ns5 branes, in the direction x4 by the ns5 branes, and in the direction x6 by
the ns5 branes. the coordinates of all branes in (x8, x9) should be equal, 2 ns5 branes
should have the same position in x7, 2 ns5 branes should have the same position in x5
and 2 ns5 branes should have the same position in x3. the low energy eective eld
theory on the d4 branes is (0, 2) supersymmetric theory in 2 dimension. the u(1)r
r symmetry is the rotational symmetry in (x8, x9) directions. the t duality along x2
direction transforms the ns5 branes into 2 kk monopoles. this gives singularities
of type a1. the t duality along the x4 direction transforms ns5 branes into 2 kk
monopoles which produce type a1 singularity. furthermore the t duality along the
x6 direction transforms ns5 branes into 2 kk monopoles which will be a1 singularity.
each surface of a1 singularity is characterized by two equations and at the origin all
surfaces meet. this is a quotient singularity of type c4/ with  = z2  z2  z2.

let us discuss the theory of n d1 branes at the origin of a space locally described
by c4/z2  z2  z2. the eld theory on the worldvolume of n d1 branes on c4 can be
obtained from ten dimensional n = 1 u(n) super yang-mills by dimensional reduction.
the eld theory of d1 branes on c4/ can be obtained by a projection into  invariant
states. the group  acts on the r symmetry of the theory and is a subgroup of su(4).

now we take the z2  z2  z2 action generators g1, g2 and g3 to act on c4 as follows:

g3 : (x, y, z, w )  (x, y, z,w ).

after diagonalizing, the regular representations of  is given by

because of x1 = x18, the charge of x1, q1 = 1 and q8 = 1 but we took only 7 charges(

in an appropriate region of 
space, we expect that this will give us exactly same description of z2  z2  z2 quotient
singularity given in (2.13). the 6  10 matrix elements can be obtained from 30  34
matrix elements by doing row operations, the remaining 6 24 vanish and in the matrix
2424 elements 24 homogeneous coordinates can be expressed in terms of 10 independent
ones.

note that one of the algebraic equations we have found, z1z2z5 = z3z4, appears n = 1
su(n)  su(n)  su(n) gauge theory on n d3 branes at the singular point in 4

21

dimensions as pointed out by [11]. the chiral matter elds transform as

a = ( , , 1), b = (1,
a = (,

, 1), b = (1, ,

, ), c = (, 1,

),
), c = ( , 1, ).

the minimal set of gauge invariant objects

z1 = |a|2, z2 = |b|2, z5 = |c|2,
z3 = abc, z4 = abc

satisfy the following constraints

z1z2z5 = z3z4.

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

this space denes a hypersurface in c5 and the three lines of singularities meet at the
origin. in the present our problem, we can think of the following gauge invariant objects

z1 = |1
z2 = |3
z3 = 1
z4 = 1
z5 = |24

111|2,
211|2,
1113
1113
212|2.

it is easy to see the gauge invariance by realizing that for the case of the product of
two elds the arrow in brane cub model starts and come back its original position and
for the triple product of elds they form closed oriented triangles like as the one in
superpotential. of course, they are not independent and are subject to the constraint
given by (5.3).

the toric analysis we have seen previous section, for example, in codimension 2 in the
parameter space , we nd specic singularity. in order to nd the worldvolume theory
we take 3, 4, 5, 6 >> 0 by keeping 1 = 2 = 0. let us set the vacuum expectation
values as follows

1,1,1 = 3, 2
1
1,1,2 = 5, 4
3

1,2,1 = 4
1,2,2 = 6

(5.5)
and all others vanish. then this breaks gauge group down to u(n)2,1,1  u(n)2,2,1 
u(n)2,1,2  u(n)2,2,2. by inserting these vevs into the superpotential masses for some
of other superelds appear. they can be integrated out by requiring the equation of
motion. we nally get the light elds and their charges.

when one is interested in placing m2 branes at the c4/ singularity in the context
of ads/cft correspondence, one can choose one compact direction in the conguration,

shrink it to get a type iia picture and then perform t dualities until the singularities
have been transformed into branes. one possibility is: let us start with

kk monoples : (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6),
kk monopoles : (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x9, x10),
kk monopoles : (x0, x1, x2, x5, x6, x9, x10),
m2 branes : (x0, x1, x2).

by shrinking x10 direction, we obtain d6 branes along the directions (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6),
kk monopoles along the directions (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x9), kk monopoles (x0, x1, x2, x5, x6, x9),
and d2 branes along the directions (x0, x1, x2). t- duality along x4 and x6 directions
lead to d4 branes along the directions (x0, x1, x2, x3, x5), ns5 branes along the direc-
tions (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x9), ns5 branes along the directions (x0, x1, x2, x5, x6, x9), and
d4 branes along the directions (x0, x1, x2, x4, x6). the last three kinds of branes look
like a brane box model. the rst kind of brane (the d4 which is related to the kk at
the beginning) breaks some of the susy. also, the nice symmetry between the dierent
zk factors in the c4/(zk  zk  zk) singularity is not clear in these dual pictures (for
instance, above two of the original kk monopoles become ns5 branes, but the other
becomes d4 branes). another compactication [15] gives 3d n = 1 theory where all
three kinds of ns5 branes have common x3 direction by taking the worldvolume of third
ns5 branes as (x0, x1, x2, x4, x6, x8) rather than (x0, x1, x4, x5, x6, x7). this theory is
non chiral and needs to be studied further.

the toric realization [16] of p3 has a tetrahedron over each interior point of which
there exists 3 torus, which shrinks to a 2 torus at four boundary faces, where it shrinks
to a circle at each edge of the tetrahedron, and where it shrinks to a point at each vertex
of the tetrahedron. each face of the tetrahedron with a two torus on top corresponds to
a p2 and each edge with a circle on top corresponds to a p1. however, the p3 itself can
not be useful, it can be used a local geometry of calabi-yau four fold near a singularity.
it is known that n(p3) appears part of calabi-yau four fold compactication where
the coordinates of which are represented by (z1, z2, z3, p) corresponding to p3 and the
cotangent direction.

when p3 is embedded in a calabi-yau fourfold, there exists a normal direction
corresponding to a line bundle on p3. the property of c1 = 0 for the fourfold gives
that the normal bundle is a canonical line bundle. the normal direction to p3 can be
identied with the space of (3, 0) forms on p3. now we have a four dimensional local
toric geometry. the extra circle action plays th role of the rotation on the phase of the
normal line bundle. the toric realization of n(p3) can be viewed as follows: a copy of
p3 is placed as the tetrahadron at the bottom. each semiinnite face emanating from
any line on it corresponds to the normal direction of p3 in the calabi-yau fourfold. for
m theory on a local singularity of a calabi-yau fourfold( p3 shrinking inside a calabi-
yau fourfold ), the local model is the canonical bundle over p3, n(p3). by modding

23

out t 3 action corresponding to three circle action on the p3, there exist 5 dimensional
space n(p3)/t 3 which is trivial except for the loci where a circle action of t 3 has xed
points. the brane realization of p3 was observed in [16]: there exist four faces of the
tetrahedron corresponding to (p, q, r) 4 branes as well as six semiinnite faces ending on
each six edge of tetrahedron, corresponding to (p, q, r) external 4 branes. it would be
interesting to study how the toric geometry arise in these brane conguration in detail.
