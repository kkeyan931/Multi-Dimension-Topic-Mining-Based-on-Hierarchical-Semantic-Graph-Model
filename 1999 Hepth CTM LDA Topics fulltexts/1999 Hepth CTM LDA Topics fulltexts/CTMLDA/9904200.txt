closed string meets branching point, example once-branched double cover torus, closed string pinched another closed string form double loop intersecting (sim- ple) branching point. notice also branching points belong world sheet. thus, string picture consistent interpretation branching points magnetic charges, string electric line self-intersect break, parabolic points electric charges,
