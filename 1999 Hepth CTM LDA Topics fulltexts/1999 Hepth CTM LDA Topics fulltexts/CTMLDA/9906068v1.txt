world-line green functions with

abstract

based on the generating functional method with an external source function, a useful

constraint on the source function is proposed for analyzing the one- and two-loop world-line

green functions. the constraint plays the same role as the momentum conservation law

of a certain nontrivial form, and transforms ambiguous green functions into the uniquely

dened green functions. we also argue reparametrizations of the green functions dened

on dierently parameterized world-line diagrams.

i. introduction

string theory organizes the scattering amplitudes in a very compact form (in the innite

string tension limit), and this fact makes the investigation of eld theory scattering amplitudes

very nontrivial and potentially useful [1]-[5]. in this spirit, multi-loop scattering amplitudes have

also been studied both from the string theory viewpoint [6]-[9] and the eld theory based on

the rst quantization formalism (world-line formalism) [10]-[14]. the general structure of eld

theory amplitudes (with n external momenta p1, p2, , pn ) at the one-loop order is described
as [1, 2]

(1.1)

where k is a certain function which depends on the detail of theory in question (it can be

determined systematically). the exponent including the function gb is sometimes called the

generating kinematical factor, and is a theory independent object. gb is the (world-line) green

function between two points on a loop of length t . one can similarly write down the generalized

formulae for certain multi-loop cases [9, 13] with using multi-loop green functions [8, 11]. in

this sense, determinations of multi-loop green functions are important factors in the world-line

formalism.

in this paper, we focus on an ambiguity problem of the multi-loop green functions. there

is an ambiguity involved in the world-line green functions, raised from the momentum conser-

vation law. all of such green functions should be reduced to the uniquely dened ones under

the constraint of a vanishing identity, without changing the value of a kinematical factor. the

problem is trivial in the one-loop case, and summarized as follows. in the original denition

1
2

2gb( ) = ( ) 

1
t

(1.2)

with imposing rotational invariance and periodicity, gb is uniquely determined as the rotational

symmetric form

gb(1, 2) = gb(1  2) = |1  2| 

(1  2)2

t

.

(1.3)

however, we do not necessarily use this functional form as concerns the kinematical factor

itself, actually which does not change if we add a polynomial in j to the gb(j, k) in (1.1)

1

because of the conservation law pk pk = 0. this ambiguity does not cause any problem in the
one-loop case, where the dening equation of gb is simple and its rotational invariance should

be clear. nevertheless, in multi-loop cases, it is certainly useful to identify the ambiguity which

can be canceled by a certain condition such as conservation law, because the denitions and

calculations of multi-loop green functions are in general complicated  in addition that the

rotational invariance is unclear in certain cases.

as the simplest nontrivial example, we discuss the two-loop green functions [11, 12]. we

refer to the green functions containing the ambiguity as the wide sense green functions. as

suggested above, the value of a kinematical factor should be invariant for any set of wide sense

green functions. various wide sense green functions can be obtained depending on how to

dene and evaluate, and we shall verify that all of them can be identied with each other in the

sense of keeping the kinematical factor invariant by way of examples. to this end, we obviously

need a constraint such as the total momentum conservation law. however, in the generic multi-

loop cases, a useful form of the conservation law is in practice not a simple summation (along

the single loop as mentioned in the one-loop case), because of the presence of additional internal

lines. we generalize the conservation law into a more suitable form to our purpose. in addition

to the momentum conservation law, we also present a continuous analogue of the conservation

law; that is a constraint on the integrals of external source functions along the two-loop world-

line vacuum diagram. this continuous version is very simple and useful to apply practical

computations, and is non-trivial since such a constraint does not exist in the source term of the

usual formulation of eld theory.

in section ii, for notational conveniences, we briey review the two-loop kinematical factor

and the green functions in 3 theory. in section iii, we present a useful two-loop momentum

conservation formula, and demonstrate how to apply the formula to the identication of dierent

wide sense green functions. in section iv, employing the generating functional method with

external source functions [14], we consider another derivation of the green functions. in this

case, we show that there also exists a similar constraint formula on the source functions, and

verify that it plays the same role as the momentum conservation method of section iii. in

section v, we further conrm the validity and usefulness of the source constraint in more

specic cases (one-loop qed). section vi is a short note on the previous work [12], concerning

2

new reparametrization transformations of the two-loop green functions. section vii contains

conclusions.

ii. notations

for the purpose of setting our notations, we briey review the world-line green functions and

the master amplitude formulae corresponding to eq.(1.1) in the two-loop 3 theory [9, 11, 13].

the (two-loop) master formula is a fundamental quantity which contains all necessary feynman

diagrams belonging to a certain class of diagrams. the classes are labeled by two or three

integers (n , n3) or (n1, n2, n3), and amplitudes are certain combinations of these classes [13].

we call the rst labeling the loop type, and the latter the symmetric type. the general form

of the master formula is as follow:

2loop
m

=

1
12

(g)n +2 z dm (4)d

d

2 exp[ eg ] .

for the loop type parameterization (n = n  + n3), the integration measure dm is

dm =

dt
t

dt3dd

n 

yn=1

dn

yl=1

d (3)

l

,

and  is the determinant factor

 = (cid:16) t t3 + t gb(, )(cid:17)1

.

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

the exponential part eg, the generating kinematical factor, takes the following bilinear form
in n external momenta (pj, p(3)

k ; j = 1, , n ; k = 1, , n3):

eg =

well). the explicit forms of these green functions are [12]

n , n = 1, , n3 run from zero to t3, the length of
the internal line (the rest part of the vacuum diagram). t and t3 are to be integrated from

zero to innity. in [9], we pointed out that one may x and eliminate one of the parameters
{, , n|n = 1, , n } because of the rotational symmetry of the fundamental loop. this
means that we can set one of these parameters to be zero which corresponds to the origin
of world-line coordinate along the fundamental loop. obviously, g(1)
rotation, and does not receive any serious change, however g(1)
translational symmetry such as seen in g(1)
parameter will be set zero. for example, if we choose  as such origin, g(1)

00 is invariant under this

03 depends on which

03 should follow

the form for  < . similarly, if , then take for  < . there is also a dierent green

function [11] from eq.(2.5). however, both coincide under the same momentum conservation

constraint (for n3 = 0) as the one-loop type.

using the transformation obtained in ref. [12], we can transform the above quantities to the

other version (symmetric parameterization). it is done by dividing the fundamental loop into

two pieces t = t1 + t2 with n  = n1 + n2 and {n}  { (1)

n ,  (2)

n }. in this case, we have [11]

(2.12)

all the formulae in this section are reproduced from string theory [8, 9], and in this sense, we

refer to these green functions (2.5)-(2.7), (2.11), and (2.12) as the standard forms.

iii. momentum conservation constraint

in this section, we encounter the (wide sense) green functions of dierent forms, depending

on calculation methods (in the symmetric parameterization). however, the value of eg should

be shown to be invariant under the constraint of total momentum conservation. in the one-loop

case, as mentioned in the introduction, the constraint is expressed by the identity

n

n

xj=1

xk=1

pj  pk m

k = 0 .

(3.1)

the single summation over all momenta pj is nothing but the summation over the fundamental
loop. however, the same structure can not be seen in (2.4) or (2.10) for the n3 6= 0 case. hence,
we shall derive a suitable two-loop generalization of this identity, and explain how it works. to

illustrate the idea clearly, we need a couple of examples of dierent green functions in the rst

place.

as explained in ref. [13], eq.(2.1) is obtained from the path integral

by using the mode expansion

a straightforward computation in this case shows that the eg part is composed of the following
green functions instead of gsym

(3.6)

a second example is from ref. [14]. the world-line green function should also be derived

as a two-point function in the sense of ordinary eld theory:

(3.12)

a main dierence from the rst example is the existence of non-constant source terms, where

further  integrations are formally impossible. this is the reason of having a dierent form of

green function. further decoupling the metric factor (g =  )
ab( (a),  (b)) ,

g ( (a),  (b)) = ggj

(3.14)

now, let us derive the two-loop version of the constraint (3.1). it can be derived by combining

the trivial identities

where  means the additions of further dierent copies mentioned above. these relations
suggest that a variety of green functions representations can be derived starting from gm
ab . in
practice, the three representations listed here (gsym, gm gj ) are connected in the following
choices of the c (a)

m coecients. we obtain g

ab, if we choose

(3.20)

in this way, every possible form is related to the standard form by the transformation rules

(3.17) and (3.18), or in other words, by the two-loop momentum constraint formula (3.16).

7

iv. source constraint

in this section, we discuss what identity in the generating functional method should play

the same role as the momentum conservation constraint (3.16).

let us rst recall the computation process from (3.9) to (3.10). the w integration in (3.9)

gives rise to the similar -function divergence as before (cf. eq.(3.6)) in the sense of minkowski

formulation, and we then have

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

here, the ra

 given in (3.11) is a symmetric tensor, however it is not a general property. rather,

the following reection anti-symmetry is general and important:

ra

(4.3)

 behaves as an even or odd function w.r.t. the center point t a/2 for the interval

suppose that j a

using these properties, we have

by this formula, we perform the gaussian integral in (4.2):

this result (4.7) holds for any linear combination of even and odd j a

 functions. it should be

noted that the odd source case implies

z ta

0

j a
( (a))d (a) = 0 ,

(a = 1, 2, 3) .

(4.8)

it means a strong sense momentum conservation which is subjected to only one of three internal

lines, and trivially satises

3

xa=1

z ta

0

j a
( (a))d (a) = 0 .

(4.9)

mimicking this property, we in general impose this identity as the total momentum conserva-

tion (sum of three lines), as advocated by the -function in (4.1).

now, let us compare the roles of discrete and continuous constraints (3.16) and (4.9) in an

example. we notice the following term in gj

ab (q.v. (3.14))

1
2



(2 (a)

1  ta)(2 (b)

(4.10)

and its corresponding term in the generating functional (4.7):

ln i[j] =  t1t2t3xa xb

d (a) z tb

)j b
 d (b) +  .

(4.11)

if we subtract the c (a)

m terms from (4.10) with the choice (3.19), we obtain gm as understood

from (3.17) and (3.18). on the other hand, using the source constraint (4.9), we can remove

from (4.11) the linear terms in  (a) and  (b) as well as the constant term:

ln i[j]   t1t2t3xa xb

z ta

0

z tb

0

 (a) (b)
tatb

j a
( (a))j b

 ( (a))d (a)d (b) +  .

(4.12)

this manipulation leads to the green function gm
 (b) linear terms corresponds to the subtraction of c (a)
removal to c (a)
0 .

1

ab as expected; i.e.the removal of the  (a) and
given in (3.19), and the constant term

in this way, the source constraint (4.9) plays the same role as the actual

momentum conservation constraint (3.16) on the kinematical factor eg, thus on the wide sense

world-line green functions. it is worth noting that the constraint (4.9) is simpler than (3.16).

v. examples in qed

the idea of the source constraint gives a family of equivalent world-line green functions as

seen in the previous section. this property is useful for identifying dierent (wide sense) green

9

functions obtained by various computations. in this section, we verify its usefulness in more

specic cases. the examples discussed here is the one-loop photon scatterings in the scalar and

spinor qed cases. first we discuss the scalar case, and then the spinor case.

the n -point function for a complex boson loop is known to be given [2] by the closed path

integral of one-dimensional bosonic eld x( ):

with the following specic source function

(  j)(jj

j ) ,

(5.2)

where 

j are photon polarization vectors, and j and j are the grassmann variables. this
source is neither an even function nor an odd one in  , and we assume the one-loop version of

the constraint (4.9) to be

z t

0

j ( )d = 0 .

this leads to the constraint similar to the momentum conservation law

n

xj=1

j 
j = 0;

j 
j = jj

j


j

+ ip

j .

(5.3)

(5.4)

the second term in jj exactly corresponds to the momentum conservation law, while the rst

term does not vanish in the sum at all. in this sense, the present constraint (5.4) assumes a

nontrivial conservation law. let us see how our idea works in the following. we perform the

path integral (5.1) as the mode integrations with expanding

x( ) = x

0 + xn>0

x
n sin(

n

t

) ,

(  xn  ) .

(5.5)

note that x0 integration diverges as the -function corresponding to the constraint (5.3). (this

is similar to the -function in eq.(4.1)). remember that this kind of divergence is usually

removed by hand (so-called zero mode divergence). the resulting expression is then

.

under the constraint (5.4), we realize that gb in the exponent (the generating kinematical

factor) in eq.(5.6) behaves as the one-loop green function (1.3) exactly, and we thus rederive

the same result [2]

(5.10)

in this example, it is clear that the source constraint helps us obtain a correct kinematical factor

even if a dierent (wide sense) green function appears in an intermediate step.

the similar argument applies to the fermion loop case as well. for simplicity, we discuss

only the spin part (world-line fermion ( )), since the bosonic part is essentially the same as

the above case. the world-line fermion part of the n -point amplitude is given by [2]

(5.16)

(5.17)

under the constraint (5.14), gf in the exponent plays the same role as the standard fermion

vi. reparametrization type transformation

(5.18)

(5.19)

this section is independent of the previous sections. in this section, we consider reparametriza-

tions and transformations between the standard two-loop green functions. as mentioned in

sect.ii, it is known that gsym and g(1) are connected by a certain transformation [12]. here,

we point out another transformation between them, using periodicities of the green functions,

and also discuss reparametrizations of g(1) through exchanging two of internal lines.

the symmetric green functions gsym and also g(1)

33 satisfy the following properties of peri-

ab (ta   (a), tb   (b)) = gsym
gsym

ab ( (a),  (b)),

(a, b = 1, 2, 3)

(6.1)

odicity

where

gsym
aa (  pa) = gsym

aa ( ), g(1)

33 (  p11) = g(1)

33 ( ),

pa = ta +

ta+1ta+2

ta+1 + ta+2

, p11 = t3 + gb(, ) =

1

t 

.

putting p3 = p11 with identifying t1 = t (1  u) and t2 = t u, we easily nd

u = |  |

t

,

12

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

and the necessary relations for the transformation between gsym and g(1) [12]

t1 = t  |  |,

t2 = |  |.

(6.5)

for later convenience, we assign more concrete notations to n in g(1) on the loop type param-

eterization:

n =

xn

yn

zn

(  < n)

(n <  )

on the internal line t3 ,




where   is given below (see eq.(6.8) and fig.1).

figure 1: the directions of  parameters.

with these relations, the transformation rule between gsym and g(1) is allowed to be expressed

as

where

n
 (2)
n
 (3)
n




= xn   ,
=    yn,
= zn,

  = (  ) + (  ) ,

   t2  yn     xn  t1 +  .

(6.7)

(6.8)

(6.9)

we can obtain another transformation by combining the property (6.1) with (6.7); i.e., replacing

13

 (a)  ta   (a) on the right-hand side in (6.7)

 (1)
n
 (2)
n
 (3)
n

= t1  xn +  ,
= t2 + yn   ,

(6.10)




from these (two-loop) transformations, we can generate an innite number of transformations

for the one-loop case, since   is reduced to an arbitrary number when the both edges of the z

line approach each other along the fundamental loop (of course, with vanishing t3); for example,

for

for

  = 0 : 

  = t2 : 


 (1) = x
 (2) = y

,

 (1) = x  t2
 (2) = t2  y

,

or 

or 


 (1) = t1  x
 (2) = t2 + y

,

(6.11)

 (1) = t  x
 (2) = y

.

(6.12)

although these one-loop transformations are certainly trivial by themselves, an interesting

deduction is that one can generate a set of transformations of h-loop green functions from

(h + 1)-loop transformations by setting one of h copies of   to be an arbitrary value.

as a second application of (6.7), let us consider some reparametrizations of g(1)

we show that the transformation of the green functions g(1)
made of internal lines where the z and x variables are dened) into g(1)

ab ; a, b = 0, 3.
ab (1, 2) living on the zx-loop (loop
2) on the xy-loop
can be found through the cyclic permutation symmetry of gsym (exchanging z-line and y-line).
namely, transforming g(1)  gsym  g(1) successively, we can read how to transform like

00 ( 

1,  

g(1)

03 (x, z)

00 (x1, x2)
g(1)

 g(1)
 g(1)
 g(1)
ab on the xz-loop is related to gsym

33 (z1, z2)

g(1)

00 (x

00 (x, y)

00 (y

(6.13)

(6.14)

(6.15)

00 on the xy-loop is related to gsym

suppose that each of g(1)
( (i),  (j)) by the rule (6.7), and that
each of g(1)
( (i),  (j)) by the same rule as (6.7):  (1) = x ,
 (2) =    y,  (3) = z. putting  (2) =  (3) and  (3) =  (2) (corresponding to the exchange
of z- and y-lines), and eliminating  (a) and  (a) from these transformation rules, we nd the

ij

ij

14

following transformation rule attributed from the exchange between z- and y-lines:

x = x
y =    z
z =    y

and t3  t2 .

(6.16)







remember that 1 is invariant in any exchange of ta. the simplest check of this rule is the

following case:

g(1)
33 (z1, z2) = |y

1  y

2| 

1  y
(y

(t3 + gb(, ))t

(t1 + t2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t2t3
(t3 + t (1  u))

(6.17)

similarly, we derive another transformation rule from the yz-loop to the xy-loop (exchange of

z-line and x-line):

x =   + z

y = y
z = x   

and t3  t1 .

(6.18)

one can organize these two sets of transformations in a unied way: let us express the

untransforming (identical) variables in (6.16) and (6.18) as

 = x(   ) + y(    ) ,

and assign  to be the parameter transforming to the z variable

 = y(   ) + x(    ) ,

the above two sets of rules (6.16) and (6.18) are now expressed in the compact form

z = (    )sign(   )

and t3  t ,

t  = t2(   ) + t1(    ).

(6.24)

(6.25)

where

in order to verify these relations, one should note that t p11 (= 1) is invariant under this

transformation rule, and also that t transforms as

t = t  + t   t3 + t 

where

t  = t  t  = t1(   ) + t2(    ) .

it is rather convenient to rewrite the green function (2.7) as

(6.26)

(6.27)

g(1)
03 (, z) = z + |   | 

1

t p11

[z2t + 2z|   |t  + (   )2(t3 + t )]

g(1)

03 (, z) = g(1)

b (,  ) +

(6.29)

applying the transformation (6.24) to eqs.(6.21), (6.28), and (6.23), we obtain

g(1)
00 (1, 2) = gb(1, 2) 


t

g(1)

(6.32)

these representations are independent of the choice of either   =  or , and reproduce

eq.(23) of [12] for the particular choice   =  (correcting an error in the literature).

vii. conclusions

in this paper, we have investigated two types of the constraints on the two-loop kinematical

factor and the world-line green functions. one is nothing but the momentum conservation law

on external legs, and the other is the vanishing constraint on the source term integrals along

the whole of world-line. although there is no direct connection between two of them, the latter

can be regarded as a continuous version of the former. because of the ambiguity raised by

the constraints, an innite number of wide sense green functions are in fact possible to take

part in the kinematical factor exponent. however, we verify that all these green functions can

be identied with the standard (restricted) green functions, all of which are reduced from a

world-sheet green function [8], and some of which are related to actual solutions of dening

dierential equations with possessing the rotational invariance along the fundamental loop [11].

conversely, the constraints loosen some imposed restrictions on the standard green func-

tions, and eventually make various evaluations and approaches possible. these constraints will

be useful for analyzing higher loops world-line green functions. especially it is clear that the

source constraint is much easier to apply than the momentum conservation constraint in the

multi-loop cases. in two-loop yang-mills theory, there arises a dierent green function in the

calculation in a constant background eld [14], and the source constraint is actually useful to

identify the green function with the standard one in the vanishing limit of constant background

eld (as demonstrated in sections iii and iv). obviously, the similar thing is expected to oc-

cur in the multi-loop cases. since expressions of multi-loop green functions are complicated,

these constraints will be useful for simplifying the expressions or for transforming into conve-

nient forms together with the transformation property (suggested below (6.12)). it might be

interesting to speculate a usefulness of our techniques in the thermal world-line cases [15].

in the nal part of the paper, we have considered the transformations among the green

functions of standard forms, associated with the reparametrizations of the two-loop world-

line diagram. on the one hand, the form of world-sheet green function is independent of

the orderings of two vertices, which join the internal line and the fundamental loop. on the

other hand, the crossing type green functions (2.7) and (2.12), which belong to the type of

a correlation between the fundamental loop and the internal line, are neither translational

17

invariant nor ordering independent. it might be that this gap will be lled in some way around
by taking account of the discussed transformations into the loop type green function g(1)

00 . the

crossing type green functions are necessary in non-abelian gauge theory, and a complexity in

the combinatorics problem will be caused by this type (similarly to the 3 theory case [14]).

we hope for a useful parameterization or a transformation to overcome these problems.
