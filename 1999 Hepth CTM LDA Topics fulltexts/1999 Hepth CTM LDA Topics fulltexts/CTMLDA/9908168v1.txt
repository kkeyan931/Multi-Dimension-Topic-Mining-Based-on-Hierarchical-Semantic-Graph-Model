abstract

topological properties of quantum system is directly associated with the

wave function. based on the decomposition theory of gauge potential, a

new comprehension of topological quantum mechanics is discussed. one

shows that a topological invariant, the rst chern class, is inherent in the

schrodinger system, which is only associated with the hopf index and brouwer

degree of the wave function. this relationship between the rst chern class

and the wave function is the topological source of many topological eects in

quantum system.

i. introduction

topology now becomes absolutely necessary in physics13. the -mapping theory and

the gauge potential decomposition theory47 are found to signicant in exhibiting the topo-

logical structure of physics system and have been used to study topological current of mag-

netic monopole4,8, topological string theory6, topological structure of gauss-bonnet-chern

theorem9, topological structure of the su(2) chern density10, topological characteristics of

dislocations and disclinations continuum11,12, topological structure of the defects of space-

time in early universe as well as its topological bifurcation13,14.

topological properties of quantum system should be directly associated with the wave

function. recently, using the -mapping theory, the topological structure of the london

equation in superconductor has been studied15. it is showed that the topological structure

of london equation is characterized by topological index of wave function.

in this paper, based on -mapping theory and gauge potential decomposition theory, we

reveal the inner relation between the topological property of schrodinger system and the

intrinsic properties of its wave function. for the rst time, we point out that a topological

invariant, the rst chern class, is inherent in the schrodinger system, which is only associated

with the wave function, without using any particular models or hypotheses. one can nd

that this relationship between the rst chern class and the wave function is the topological

source of the inner structure of london equations in superconductor15.

ii. decomposition theory of u (1) gauge potential and the

first chern class

considering a complex line bundle r3c, as one knows, the u(1) gauge potential a =

aidxi is a connection on this bundle. a section of the line bundle gives a complex valued

functions , and the convariant derivative on the line bundle is dened as

d = d  ia,

2

and its complex conjugate

d = d + ia.

from these formula above, one can obtain

a = 

i
2

d  d



+

i
2

d  d



.

(1)

the main feature of the decomposition theory of the gauge potential is that the gauge

potential a can be generally decomposed as

a = a + b,

(2)

where a is required to satisfy the gauge transformation rule and b satises the vector con-

variant transformation, i.e.,

and

a = a + d

b = b

(3)

(4)

under u(1) transformation  = ei. one can show that the gauge potential a are rigorously

satises the gauge transformation

a = a + d.

comparing (2) with (1), we can obtain a decomposition expression of u(1) gauge potential

by dening

and

a = 

i
2

d  d



b =

i
2

d  d



,

.

(5)

(6)

one can easily prove that this decomposition satises the transformation rules (3) and (4).

3

we know that the complex valued function  can be denoted as

 = 1 + i2,

in which 1 and 2 are real valued function and can be regarded as two components of a

two-dimensional vector eld  = (1, 2) on r3. the unit vector eld is dened as

na =

a
||||

,

|||| = (aa)

1

2 ,

a = 1, 2,

(7)

satisfying

from (5) and (7), it can be seen that

nana = 1.

a = abdnanb.

we know that the characteristic class is the fundamental topological property, and it is

independent of the gauge potential1,16. so, to discuss the chern class, we can take a as

a = abdnanb.

(8)

one can regard it as a special gauge. then the eld strength (the curvature) f can be

expressed as

using (7) and

f changes into

f = da = abdna  dnb.

(9)

dna =

da
||||




a ln |||| =

ad(||||)

f = ab

a ln ||||dc  db.

by making use of the laplacian relation in  space:


a


a ln |||| = 22(),

4

we obtain

f = 22()abda  db,

one nds that f does not vanish only at the zero points of , i.e.

(x) =0.

the solution of eqs. (11) are generally expressed as

x = xi(v),

i = 1,    m,

(10)

(11)

(12)

which represent m zero lines li (i = 1,    , m) with v as intrinsic coordinates. there exists

a two-dimensional manifold  which normally intersects li at the point xi and u = (u1, u2)

are the intrinsic coordinates on . in the -function theory17,18, one can prove that

where

2() =

xi=1

the positive i is the hopf index of -mapping and i is the brouwer degree19:

(13)

(14)

i = sgnd(


u

) = 1

the meaning of the hopf index i is that the vector eld function  covers the corresponding

region i times while x covers the region neighborhood of zero zi once.

the integration of f on 

c1 =

1

2 z

f

(15)

is the rst chern class, an important topological invariant of the line bundle. from (10)

and (13), we can obtain

c1 =

m

xi=1

ii.

(16)

from this result, we see that the rst chern class is the sum of the index of zero points, and

labeled by the hopf index and brouwer degree, or the winding number of .

iii. topological invariant in quantum mechanics

the topological property of quantum system should be directly associated with the

intrinsic properties of the wave function. considering a schrodinger system:

ih


t

 = h,

where  is the wave function. the current density of this system is given by

j(r,t) = 

ih
2m

(  ).

for the purpose to study the topological property, we consider this system with a xed time.

hence the wave function  can be regarded as a section of a complex line bundle over r3

and can be denoted as

(r) = 1(r) + i2(r).

one denes a physical quantity v as

v = 

i
2

(  )



.

(17)

(18)

under u(1) transformation  = ei, one can see that v satises the gauge transformation

v= v+.

so, one should notice here that v is a composed u(1) gauge potential. one can prove that

v = abnanb = abinanb~ei,

(19)

where ~ei (i = 1, 2, 3) denote (x, y, z), and

  v = ijkabjnaknb~ei = 2j i~ei,

with

j i =

1
2

ijkabjnaknb,

6

(20)

which is a topological current. from the discussion in above section, we have

  v =22() ~d(


x

),

~d(


x

) = ijkabjj~ei.

where

and then

  v =2

m

xi=1

ii zli

3(~r  ~ri(v))

~d(

d(/u)

from7, it is easy to see that

then the current (20) is turned to

~d( 
x )

d(/u)

|~ri(v) =

d~ri

~j =

  v =

xi=1

ii zli

(21)

(22)

(23)

it is obvious to see that the formula (23) represents a current of m isolated vortices with

the i-th vortex carries charge 2ii. and, one can prove that

q = z

~j  d~ =

m

xi=1

ii.

(24)

comparing this result with (15) and (16), we see that the total topological charge of this

system is equal to the rst chern number. so, one nds that the schrodinger system inherits

a topological invariant, the rst chern class, which is only associated with the intrinsic

properties of wave function, without using any particular models or hypotheses. one can

nd that this relationship between the rst chern class and the wave function is the source

of many topological eects in quantum system.

as an example, let us now consider a homogeneous superconductor in a magnetic eld

which is weak compared with the critical eld bc2 at which the superconductivity is lost.

the relation between the superconductor current ~js and the condensate wave function  is

js =

eh


||2v

2e2
c

||2a.

7

(25)

let the body we studied be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, so that there is no

normal current and j = js. we shall also use the general maxwells equations:

  b =

4
c

j,

  b =0.

(26)

(27)

to put them in the appropriate form, we rst rewrite the relation (25) between the super-

conductivity current density and v through (26):

a + 2  b =

0
2

v.

(28)

for the london approximation corresponds to the assumption that  is constant, taking the

curl of both sides of (28) and noting that   a = b and (27), we have

b  22b =

0
2

  v.

(29)

comparing this expression with (23), one obtain the topological structure of london equa-

tion:

b  22b = 0

m

xi=1

ii zli

dr3(r  ri).

(30)

it is obvious to see that the equation (30) represents m isolated vortices of which the ith

vortex carries ux ii0. on can conclude that includes vortex-antivortex pair20,21(1 = 2,

1 = 1 and 2 = 1), vortex rings (li is a ring), multicharged vortices22.

iv. discussion

based on the -mapping theory, using gauge potential decomposition method, we reveal

that the rst chern class is inherent in schrodinger system, which is only associated with

the intrinsic properties of the wave function.

in fact, this topological property does not

only relate to the schrodinger system, but also relates to the non-linear schrodinger system

as well as the condensate schrodinger system. we must point out that this relationship

8

naturally exists in (2 + 1)-dimensional quantum system and is associated with the discussion

of topological structure of quantum hall eect23. we believe that this intrinsic topological

property is a fundamental property of quantum system and is the source of many topological

eects in quantum system.
