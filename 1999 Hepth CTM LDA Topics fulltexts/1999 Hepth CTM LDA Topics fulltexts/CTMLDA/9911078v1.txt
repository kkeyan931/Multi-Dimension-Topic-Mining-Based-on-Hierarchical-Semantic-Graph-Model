conformal field theory and the exact solution of the bcs hamiltonian

instituto de matematicas y fsica fundamental, c.s.i.c., madrid, spain.

german sierra

we propose a connection between conformal eld theory (cft) and the exact solution and in-
tegrability of the reduced bcs model of superconductivity. the relevant cft is given by the
su (2)k-wzw model in the singular limit when the level k goes to 2. this theory has to be per-
turbed by an operator proportional to the inverse of the bcs coupling constant. using the free eld
realization of this perturbed wess-zumino-witten model, we derive the exact richardsons wave
function and the integrals of motion of the reduced bcs model in the saddle point approximation.
the construction is reminiscent of the cft approach to the fractional quantum hall eect.

i) introduction

the bcs theory has been used for decades to de-
scribe the superconducting properties of low tc metal-
lic materials1. the starting point of the theory is a
hamiltonian which describes the attractive interaction
between the electrons in well dened energy levels. the
grand canonical bcs wave function gives a very accu-
rate solution of the bcs hamiltonian in the limit where
the number of electrons, ne, is very large. the bcs
wave function may also be projected to a xed number of
electrons, ne, giving essentially the same physics when
ne >> 1. however for small values of ne, one has to
use exact analytical or numerical methods to obtain re-
liable results. the study of small xed-ne superconduc-
tivity has a long story which goes back to an old ques-
tion posed by anderson as to what is the smaller size of
a metallic particle to remain superconducting2. recent
experiments3 involving aluminium grains with nanome-
ter size have inspired a number of theoretical works where
andersons question is reconsidered415.

in this paper we shall be concerned with the exact ana-
lytic solution of the reduced bcs hamiltonian proposed
by richardson in a series of papers between 1963 and
19771624. this solution emerged in the framework of
nuclear physics and has passed unnoticed by most of the
physics comunity until the recent upheaval in ultrasmall
metallic grains. a closely related work is that of cam-
biaggio, rivas and saraceno (crs) who proved recently
the integrability of the reduced bcs hamiltonian with-
out recourse to richardsons solution25. these authors
found a set of integrals of motion whose number equals
that of the degrees of freedom of the system. our aim
is to show that richardsons solution, together with its
integrability, can be naturally understood in the frame-
work of conformal eld theory (cft). in other words,
we shall propose a correspondence between cft and the
bcs theory which gives a neat picture of the richard-
sons wave function and the conserved quantities found

1

by crs, which are in that sense unied in a common
framework. our work is reminiscent to the application
of cft to the laughlin wave function27 of the fractional
quantum hall eect (fqhe)28.

the organization of the paper is as follows. in sections
ii and iii we present brief reviews on the exact solu-
tion of the reduced bcs hamiltonian and the free eld
realization of the su (2)k-wzw model.
in section iv
we derive the exact richardsons solution and we show
integrability of the bcs model using the free eld re-
alization of the su (2)k-wzw model. in section v we
explain the bcs/cft connection in a second quantized
language. in section vi we explore the analogies and dif-
ferences between the cft approaches to bcs and the
fqhe. finally, in section vii we state our conclusions
and prospects of future work.

j,) is an electron destruction (
where cj, ( resp.
resp. creation) operator in the time-reversed states |j,i
with energies j, d is the mean level spacing and g is
the bcs dimensionless coupling constant. the sums in
(1) run over a set of  doubly degenerate energy lev-
els j(j = 1, . . . , ). we shall assume in this paper
that the energy levels are all distinct, i.e. i 6= j for
i 6= j. the hamiltonian (1) is really a simplied ver-
sion of the reduced bcs hamiltonian where all couplings
have been set equal to a single one, namely g. this is
the model that is commoly used to described ultrasmall
grains, which describes the scattering of pairs of electrons
between discrete energy levels that come in time-reversed

states. hereafter we shall refer to (1) simply as the bcs
hamiltonian.

as mentioned in the introduction, richardson had long
ago solved this model exactly for an arbitrary set of lev-
els, j, not necessarily all distinct1624. to simplify mat-
ters, we shall assume that there are not singly occupied
electronic levels. as can be seen from (1), these levels
decouple from the rest of the system; they are said to be
blocked, contributing only with their energy j to the to-
tal energy e. the above simplication implies that every
energy level j is either empty ( i.e. |vaci), or occupied by
a pair of electrons ( i.e. c
j,|vaci). denote the total
number of electrons pairs by n . then of course n  .
the most studied case in the literature corresponds to
the half-lled situation, where the number of electrons,
ne = 2n , is equal to the number of levels 415. in the
absence of interaction ( i.e. g = 0), all the pairs occupy
the lowest energy levels forming a fermi sea. the pair-
ing interaction promotes the pairs to higher energies and
eventually, for large values of n , all the levels are pair
correlated, giving rise to superconductivity1.

richardsons solution

in order to describe richardsons solution one denes

the hard-core boson operators

bj = cj,cj,+, b

j = c

j,, nj = b

which satisfy the commutation relations,

[bj, b

j  ] = j,j  (1  2nj)

the hamiltonian (1) can then be written as

where we have set d = 1 ( i.e. all the energies are mea-
sured in units of d). richardson showed that the eigen-
states of this hamiltonian with n pairs have the (un-
normalized) product form1618 ( for a direct proof of the
results of this subsection see reference29 )

the ground state of hbcs is given by the solution of
eqs.(6) which gives the lowest value of e(n ). the (nor-
malized) states (5) can also be written as20

(9)

the sum in (9) runs over all the permutations, p, of
1, , n . the constant c in (8) guarantees the normal-
ization of the state20 ( i.e. rhn|nir = 1); its expression
will be given in section iv.
a well known fact about the bcs hamiltonian is that
it is equivalent to that of a xy model with long range
couplings and a position dependent magnetic eld pro-
portional to j. to see this let us represent the hard-core
boson operators (2) in terms of the pauli matrices as fol-
lows,

amounts to the eqs.

(16)

denote the eigenvalue of rj acting on the state (8) by
j, namely

rj|nir = j|nir

(17)

crs, seemingly unaware of richardsons solution, did
not give an expression of j in their work. however, they
did show that hxy given in eq.(11) can be expressed in
terms of the operators ri as

this ends the presentation of the exact solution of
the bcs hamiltonian. the existence of an underly-
ing analytic structure reminiscent to that of a cft is
apparent from eqs.
indeed, the
aforementioned equations contain factors of the form
1/(z  z) where z and z stands for either 2j or e.
terms of this sort arise quite naturally as correlators (
i.e. ha(z)b(z)i = 1/(zz)) of chiral primary elds a(z)
and b(z) in diverse cfts. the problem is to identify
which cft explains all the features presented so far in a
unied manner. we shall argue that the solution of this
problem is given by the wess-zumino-witten (wzw)
model based on the ane kac-moody group su (2)k in
the limit where the level k goes to 2. the proof of this
result requires standard tools of cft and, more precisely,
the free eld or coulomb gas (cg) representation of the
wzw model.

iii) review of the free field

representation of the su (2)k -wzw

model

the material presented in this section is standard in
the cft literature30. nevertheless, we have included it

for the benet of readers that are not experts in cft.
this will allows us to highlight the main tools we shall
use in later sections. we shall follow closely reference31.
the wzw model is an interacting theory which nev-
ertheless admits a description in terms of free elds32.
the correlators and conformal blocks can then be easily
calculated as integrals of vacuum expectation values of
vertex operators. this gives an integral representation
of the conformal blocks which satisfy automatically the
knizhnik-zamolodchikov (kz) equations33. in the case
of the su (2)k-wzw model the free elds are a   
system with conformal weights 1 and 0, respectively, and
a boson eld  which satisfy the following operator prod-
uct expansion (ope)31,32,

(z) (w) = (z) (w) = 1
(z) (w) = ln(z  w)

zw

(21)

the wzw currents j a(z)(a = 0,) can be expressed
in terms of these elds as ( hereafter, normal order of
operators will be implicitely assumed)

j + = i 

j 0 =  i
20
j  = i [2 + i
0

   
   k]

(22)

which satisfy the opes

j a(z) j b(w) = k/2

c j c(w) + reg. terms (23)

(zw)2 qab + 1

zw f ab

where f ab
c are the su (2) structure constants dened in
eq.(13), and q00 = 1, q+ = q+ = 2. the level of the
wzw model, k, is related to the charge 0 by the eq.

k + 2 =

1
22
0

(24)

if k is a positive integer, the wzw model is a ratio-
nal conformal field theory (rcft) with k + 1 primary
elds labelled by the total spin, j = 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2. in
our cft approach to bcs, we shall need to consider
the limit where k  2, which corresponds to taking
0  . this is a singular limit which takes us away
from the rational wzw models. actually, the case when
k is exactly 2 is mathematically interesting due to its
relation to the singular hyperplanes in the representa-
tion theory of ane kac-moody algebras34,35. for non-
positive integer values of k, we can still dene the theory
by the free eld representation given above.

the sugawara energy-momentum tensor tsug of the
wzw model is given by the sum of the energy momen-
tum tensors of the    system and the bosonic eld


tsug =    1

2 ()2 + i0 2

(25)

the central extension c of the virasoro algebra gener-

ated by the modes of tsug(= pn lnzn2) is

3

c = 3  122

0 =

3k

k + 2

(26)

where the    system contributes with 2 and the eld
 contributes with 1  122
0. in (26) we have used the
relation (24), which for integer ks gives the well known
value of the virasoro central charge of the su (2)k-wzw
model. in the limit (k + 2)  0 the central extension c
diverges. in order to get a meaningful theory one has to
scale the virasoro operators as ln = limk2(k + 2)ln.
in that limit the virasoro algebra becomes

[ ln, lm] = 0

(27)

which suggests some sort of integrability.
in fact the
commutativity of the virasoro operators ln has been
used to study the representation theory of the su (2)k=2
kac-moody algebra for the proof of the kac-kazhdan
conjecture34 concerning character formulas (see35 for ref-
erences).

the primary elds j

m(z) of the wzw model are la-
belled by the total spin j = 0, 1/2, . . . and the third
component of the spin m = j, . . . ,j. their free eld
representation is given by

j

m(z) = jm(z) vj (z)

vj (z) = eij (z), j = 20j

(28)

and have a conformal weight j given entirely by that of
the vertex operator vj , namely

j =

1
2

j (j  20) =

j(j + 1)

k + 2

(29)

in the free eld representation of a cft, every pri-
mary eld has a conjugate version besides its direct
representant, which is needed for the computation of
correlators36. in the case of the wzw model, the conju-
gate of the primary eld with m = j is

j
j(z) = s+2j (z) v20(s+j)(z), s = (k + 1)

(30)

the corresponding equation for m < j is much more
complicated, and it is a sum of terms where the dierence
between  elds and  elds is given by s + j + m.

a particular case of (30) is when j = 0, which corre-

sponds to the conjugate eld of the identity

i(z) = s(z) v20s(z)

(31)

a consequence of (31) is that the expectation values of
operators should satisfy the following charge neutrality
conditions

n  n = s, xi

i = 20s, s = (k + 1)

(32)

where n and n is the number of  and  elds in the
correlator, and i are the charges of the vertex operators
made of the eld . eq.(32) means that there is a back-
ground charge 20s in the boson sector and a charge

s in the    sector, which need to be neutralize for
the correlator to be non-vanishing. the latter properties
can alternatively be attributed to the out vacuum which
have charges 20 and s in the  and    sectors,
respectively.
the remaining ingredient of the free eld representa-

tion is provided by the so called screening charge

q = ic

dus(u), s(u) = (u) v20 (u)

(33)

whose basic property is that it commutes with the su (2)
current algebra and the virasoro operators. in eq.(33)
and below, du is meant to contain the factor 1/(2i)
to takes care of the factor 2i that comes out in the
residue formula. using the vertex representations (28)
and (30) of the primary elds, together with the screen-
ing charge (33), one can compute the conformal blocks of
the wzw model. conformal blocks are the chiral build-
ing blocks of correlators. the latter are obtained by com-
bining the holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic confor-
mal blocks and imposing monodromy invariance. in the
wzw model a conformal block w zw (z1, . . . , z+1) in-
volving  + 1 primary elds {(jk, mk)}+1
k=1 , inserted at
the positions {zk}+1
k=1 , can be associated with the su (2)
tensor product decomposition

j1  . . .  j  j+1
p
k=1 mk = m+1

w zw (z1, . . . , z+1)
m(z) j+1

(34)

(35)

where (j+1, m+1) appears as an outgoing state. the
free eld expression of the conformal blocks is given by

m+1(z+1)
dun s(un )i

m1(z1) . . . j
du1s(u1) . . .hcn

= hj1
hc1
where j+1
is the conjugate of the outgoing state
m+1
(j+1, m+1), and the screening charges are integrated
along the contours c1, . . . , cn . the charge neutrality
conditions (32) applied to (35) yield

n =

jk  j+1, m+1 =



xk=1

mk

(36)

allowed value of j+1 = p
requires n = p

which agree with the clebsch-gordan decomposition
(34). the case when n = 0 corresponds to the maximal
k=1 jk. on the other hand,
if  is even, the minimal value of j+1 is zero, which
k=1 jk screening charges. hence, the dif-
ferent choices of the screening charges and contours give
rise to all possible conformal blocks. in this manner the
free eld representation provides integral solutions of the
kz equations satised by the conformal blocks (35). the
kz eqs are33

iv) cft representation of the exact

solution of bcs

our rst aim is to obtain richardsons wave function
(9) using the free eld representation of the wzw model.

richardsons wave function

the starting point is the speudospin version of the bcs
model introduced in section ii, according to which an
empty energy level i(i = 1, . . . , ) has spin mi = 1/2
while and occupied level has spin mi = 1/2. this sug-
gests to rewrite richardsons wave function as

r

m1,,m(z1, . . . , z; e1, . . . , en ) = xp

yk=1

n

zlk  epk

(38)

where zi = 2i and lk is dened by the condition mlk =
1/2. the su (2) quantum numbers mi of (38) satisfy



xi=1

mi =


2  n

(39)

let us compare now the conformal block (35) and the
wave function (38). if we take jk = 1/2(k = 1, . . . , ) in
(35) and use (39), we are lead to the identications

j+1 = m+1 =


2  n

(40)

which requires n  /2. hence from a formal point
of view, we can regard richardsons wave function as
a conformal block involving  primary elds 1/2
mj (zj),
located at the positions zj = 2j, and a primary eld
j+1
m+1(z+1) whose position we shall place at . the
last ingredient we need, in order to reproduce richard-
sons wave function using cft tools, is to nd the role
played by the bcs coupling constant g. we shall see
below that g is associated to the operator

vg = exp(

i0

(41)

our claim is that richardsons wave function (38) is
given, up to a proportionality factor, by the limit

except for the presence of the operator vg, eq.(43) coin-
cides with the conformal block (35). let us now prove
eq.(42). first of all, using the free eld representation of
the primary elds, one can write (43) as

using eqs.(21) and the wick theorem, one can show that

tion, namely

r
m(z, e) = (1)n 

m (z, e)

(46)

in this equation we have choosen the positions of the
screening operators ui equal to the richardsons param-
eters ei. however, in eq.(44) one must integrate over the
us. the job of the limit 0   is to set ui = ei. let
us see how this happens. first of all the contribution of
the vertex operators can be computed using the formula

hvgv1 (w1) . . . vm (wm )i

= qi<j (wi  wj)ij qj e0j wj /g

(47)

where the contour cg encircles all the coordinates wj.
the factor  then becomes

(z, u) = qj e2

0zj /gq e22

qi<j(zi  zj)2

in the limit 0  , the integral (44) can be computed
using the saddle point method. indeed, writting (48) as

the normalized state (8)20, namely

c = 1/(deta)1/2

(54)

coupling version of bcs, which is valid for all val-
ues of the bcs coupling constant g, since there are
not phase transitions as we go from weak to strong
coupling.

 so far, we have assumed for simplicity that the
pair degeneracy of the energy levels j is unity,
which corresponds in the wzw model to primary
elds with spin jk = 1/2. the construction can be
straighforwardly generalized to levels with higher
degeneracy, dk = 1, 2, . . ., in which case the asso-
ciated primary elds have spin jk = dk/2. in this
case the richardson equations read23,24,

(55)

and they can be derived using the free eld rep-
resentation explained above in terms of the elds
jk

mk (zk) with jk = dk/2.

let us make some comments about the results pre-

the integrability of bcs from cft

sented so far.

 richardson has observed that eqs.(6) could be de-
rived as the stationary congurations for a set of
electrostatic charges in 2d24. the electrostatic po-
tential of these charges is given by 2
0u or rather
by the sum 2
0(u + u ). our cft derivation of
the exact bcs solution shows that the value of the
charges are 0 for the energy levels, 20 for the
screening ones, and a charge 20(s + j+1) placed
at innity. the sum of all these charges neutral-
izes the background charge 20s. the stationary
conditions are set by the limit 0  , which is
equivalent to the limit k  2.

 the operator vg, which is needed in order to get
the term 1/g in the richardsons equations, breaks
conformal invariance in an explicit manner. this
is why cg is not, strictly speaking, a conformal
block of the wzw model. in the spirit of perturbed
conformal field theory37 we could say that the
wzw model has been perturbed by the chiral op-
erator  i0
g h dzz which is equal to 0a1/g,
where a1 is the n = 1 mode of the eld 
(i(z) = pn anzn1).
 the perturbative renormalization group (rg) anal-
ysis of the bcs model yields that the coupling con-
stant g > 0 ows to large values in the infrared
regime, leading to the superconducting instability
of the fermi sea38. in our approach the xed point
of this rg ow is described by the su (2)k=2-
wzw model. the 1/g perturbation takes us away
from this xed point, breaking conformal invari-
ance. in that sense, we are dealing with the strong

at this stage it is clear that eqs. (15) and (17) must
be related to the kz eq.
(37). after all, in the limit
0   the cg wave function (43) coincides with the
wzw wave function. let us show this in detail. the
kz eq.(37) with z+1 =  and the denition (15) can
be written as

(cid:18)

let us dene a new wave function 

w zw = ehxy /2g 

(56)

(57)

using the commutativity of ri and hxy and the fact
that


zi

hxy = t0

eq.(56) becomes

(cid:18) 1

ri + 



zi(cid:19)  = 0

(58)

(59)

this equation is completely equivalent to the kz eq.
imposing that  diagonalizes ri with eigenvalue i,  be-
comes proportional to the richardson solution, or rather
to cg. hence eq.(49) yields the following expression for
i

i =

(60)

which in turn leads to the formula (20). in other words,
w zw , cg and r agree up to overall factors in the

6

limit when 0  . it is interesting to observe that the
factor relating the wzw and richardson wave functions
has indeed a conformal structure reected solely in the
presence of logarithms, namely

hbcs with n pairs and  levels, which is given by the

combinatorial number (cid:18) 

n (cid:19), coincides with the total

number of contour choices.

(61)

eqs.(63) and (64) provide the basic correspondences
between the exact solution of bcs and cft, which can
be extended to other instances. we collect them in table
1 and make some comments below.

both the richardsons eqs. and the constants of motion
i.

v) the bcs/cft correspondence

in the previous section we have shown the closed rela-
tionship between the bcs and the cft wave functions.
in this section we want to investigate this relation at
the second quantized level. in a quantum field theory
a generic n-body wave function (x1, . . . , xn ) is usu-
ally constructed from the overlap of a nbody state |i
with the eigenstates |x1, . . . , xni created by the action of
the eld operator (x) acting on the fock vacuum |0i,
namely

(x1, . . . , xn ) = h|x1, . . . , xni
|x1, . . . , xni = (x1) . . . (xn )|0i

(62)

an interesting example of this formalism is provided by
the cft interpretation of the laughlin wave function27
of the fractional quantum hall eect (fqhe), rst pro-
posed by fubini28. in that case (x) is a vertex operator
of a single boson governed by a c = 1 cft. one can also
make use of an array of bosons.

in the spirit of the fqhe/cft correspondence, one

can interpret the coulomb gas wave function (43) as

cg
m (z) = hcg|z1, m1, . . . , z, mi

(63)

where

|z1, m1, . . . , z, mi = q
hcg| = h0(  2n )|vg qn
the out vacuum h0(  2n )| has been dened as the
action of the operator j+1
m+1 on the out vacuum of the
wzw model, and has a charge 0(2n ) in the  sector
and no charge in the    sector. the dierent states
hcg| correspond to dierent choices of the integration
contours c of the screening operators s(u), which in
cft yield dierent conformal blocks. for example, the
ground state is obtained by choosing the th-contour ( =
1, . . . , n ) to run from z to innity, where we assume
that the energy levels are ordered in increasing order,
i.e. z1 < z2 < . . . < z. the excited states correspond to

 in analogy to eqs.(64) one could try to dene the
bra statehz1, m1, . . . , z, m| using the conjugate
operators 
m(z). however, this state would have
a large charge which would be dicult to compen-
sate for. similarly, the ket state |cgi is not easy
to construct since the screening operator s(z) does
not have a conjugate version. a possibility would
be to use the second screening operator, given by
s(z) = s1exp(i(z)/0)31. this operator ap-
pears in the construction of fractional spin repre-
sentations which are related upon a certain reduc-
tion to the minimal models. in the limit 0  
we see that s(z) converges to the identity. further
work is needed to clarify this issue.
 in section iii we dened the virasoro operators ln
as the singular limit limk2(k + 2)ln. from eq.
(59) we see that ri could be identied with the ac-
tion of g l(i)
1 = /zi. simi-
larly, eq.(18) implies that hxy could be identied,
up to constants, with g(k + 2)pj zj/zj and
thus with g l0. upon these identications, the
integrability of the bcs model, given by eqs. (16),
becomes equivalent to the commutativity (27) of
the virasoro operators l0 and l(i)
1. we may expect

1 on cg, where l(i)

the existence of another crs-like integrals of mo-
tion associated to the virasoro operators ln(n

 the richardsons state rhn| corresponds, in the
cft formulation, to the state hcg|, which is the
product of n screening operators acting on the out
vacuum h0(  2n )|. this correspondence sug-
gests that in the grand canonical (g.c.) ensemble (
where the number of pairs is not xed ) the corre-
sponding state should be given by

plays no role in xing the critical temperature or
other observables39. as was shown by richardson24
eqs.(6) reduce in the bulk limit n   to the bcs
gap equation and hence the state (8) becomes the
xed n projection of the mean eld g.c. bcs state.
finite values of 0 should lead to non mean eld
theories with the phase  playing a dynamical role.
it is rather intriguing that models of this sort have
already been proposed by several authors for an
explanation of high-tc superconductivity39.

vi) comparison between bcs and the

fqhe

( note that we have assumed the half lled condi-
tion  = 2n ). this state is similar to the bcs
state given by1

hbcs| = hvac| exp(xk

gkbk)

(66)

in sections v and vi we noticed some analogies be-
tween the cft approaches to bcs and the fqhe. let
us consider them in some more detail. a common feature
is the coulomb gas treatment. in the fqhe the cg is
associated to the laughlin wave function of ne electrons
at lling factor  = 1/m,27

where gk is the ratio vk/uk of the bcs variational
parameters.
in this sense, the screening charge

h dzs(z) is the cft version of the cooper pair
operator pk gkbk.

in cft it has been argued36
that the screening operators can be exponentiated
into the action and that their number is xed upon
imposing the charge neutrality conditions on cor-
relators. this cft exponentiation corresponds to
working in the grand canonical emsemble in bcs.

 in the previous item we argued that s(z) =
(z)exp(20i(z)) is the cft analogue of gkbk. on
the other hand, bk corresponds to the contour in-
tegration of j +(z) = i(z) around the pair energy
zk = 2k. hence it is natural to associate the bcs
variational parameter gk with exp(20i(z)). this
means that 20(z) can be associated to the phase
of the superconducting order parameter. shifting
(z) by a constant leads to an overall phase shift
of the bcs order parameter. this correspondence
yields an insight about the physical meaning of 2
0,
which seems to be related to the phase stiness or
the superuid density ns.
indeed, if we identify
the phase of the superconducting order parameter
 with 0 then the lagrangian of  becomes that
of a continuum xy model for , with 2
0 playing the
role of the superuid density. actually 2
0 appears
in the denominator of the lagrangian while ns ap-
pears in the numerator. however recall that we are
working in the energy space so things are inverted.
the identication of  with 0 is also consistent
with the fact that both variables are dened mod-
ulo 2. the limit 0   therefore corresponds to
the limit of very large phase stiness which in fact
leads to the standard bcs theory, where the phase
of the superconducting order parameter is rigid and

l(w1, . . . , wne ) =

the norm of (67) can be seen as a classical probability

the particles with charge m repell each other with a log-
arithmic interaction, and they are attracted to the ori-
gin by an uniform neutralizing background charge with
density  = 1/(22
b), where b is the magnetic length,
which has been set equal to one in (67) and (68). for
small values of m(= 3, 5, . . .) the electrons form a liquid
with uniform density e = 1/(2m2
b) which neutralizes
the background charge. however, for large values of m,
quantum montecarlo studies have shown that the laugh-
lin liquid becomes a solid ( i.e. a wigner crystal) where
the positions of the charges are localized.

the comparison between the wave function  given
in eq. (48) and the laughlin wave function l suggests a
formal identication of the electron positions wj with the
screening positions uj rather than with the pair energies
levels zj. the reason is that both the us and the ws
are subject to integration, while the zs are held xed.
following this analogy, we may stablish the relations

m = 42

0, or  =

k + 2

2

(69)

according to which the freezing of the screening charges
in the limit 0   would parallel the wigner crytal

8

structure of the fqhe when m is large. on the con-
trary, for nite values of 0 the screening charges, which
are essentially cooper pairs, would delocalize becoming a
sort of liquid. the discussion at the end of the previous
section suggests that this liquid should arise from the
uctuations of the phase of the superconducting order
parameter.

besides

these analogies,

the laughlin and bcs
coulomb gas models dier in the nature of the back-
ground charge. in the laughlin case the charge is two-
dimensional, while in the bcs case the linear terms ap-
pearing in u ( see eq. (50)) can be attributed to a linear
uniform density   0/g placed at innity. the lat-
ter density creates a uniform electric eld x(u + u )
along the x = (z + z)/2 axis. another dierence is that
the bcs theory is not really conformal invariant for -
nite values of g while the laughlin state has gapless edge
excitations described by cft40.

vii) conclusions and prospects

in this paper we have established a closed relationship
between the exact solution of the bcs hamiltonian and
the coulomb gas version of the su (2)k-wzw model in
the singular limit when k  2. the richardsons wave
function comes from the    chiral correlators, while
the richardsons eqs. and the normalization factor of
the state arises from the saddle point evaluation of the
chiral boson correlators. the bcs coupling constant g
enters the construction as a perturbation of the wzw
model and breaks conformal invariance. the integrabil-
ity of the bcs model is related to that of the wzw
model through the kz equations, which has lead us to
an expression of the integrals of motion of the bcs model
found by cambiaggio, rivas and saraceno. we have pro-
posed a bcs/cft correspondence which, in many re-
spects, parallels the cft interpretation of the fractional
quantum hall eect. we have conjectured that the sin-
gular limit 2
0   amounts in physical terms to the
limit of very strong phase stiness, which leads to the
mean eld bcs theory. finite 0 generalizations of the
bcs model may correspond to non mean eld theories
where the phase of the superconducting order parame-
ter should have a dynamical role as in some models of
high-tc superconductivity39.

besides giving new insights into the exact solution of
the bcs model, the cft approach may also help in
solving some problems as the computation of observables
with the richardsons exact solution. the nite temper-
ature bcs model is also an interesting problem which
one may try to address with cft tools.

finally, the bcs/cft approach can be straighfor-
wardly generalized to any wzw model based on an
ane kac-moody algebra gk, where k is the level and
g is a semi-simple lie group or supergroup. as in the
su (2) case, one can use the free eld realization of these

models32,41. for the gk-wzw model the singular limit
is given by k + h  0, where h is the dual coxeter num-
ber of g35. the charge and spin independent pairing
hamiltonians studied by richardson23,24 in the context
on nuclear physics probably belong to this category of
models.
