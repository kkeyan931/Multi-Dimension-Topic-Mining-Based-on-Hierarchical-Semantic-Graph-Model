abstract

the purpose of this paper is to investigate the gauge symmetry of classical
eld theories in integral formalism. a gauge invariant theory is dened in terms
of the invariance of the physical observables under the coordinate transformations
in principal bundle space. through the detailed study on the properties of non-
abelian parallel transportor under gauge transformations, we show that it is not
generally a two-point spinor, i.e. an operator to be aected only by the gauge
group elements at the two end points of the parallel transport path, except for
the pure gauge situation, and therefore the local gauge symmetry for non-abelian
models is found to be broken in non-perturbative domain. however, an abelian
gauge theory is proved to be strictly invariant under local gauge transformation,
as it is illustrated by the result of aharonov-bohm experiment. the related
issues of the phenomenon are discussed.

1 introduction

it has been accepted without doubt that the present-day physical theories of the fun-
damental interactions in nature largely follow from the principle of gauge symmetry,
which postulates that any physically acceptable eld model should be invariant under
gauge transformations. for a concrete gauge eld model it is constructed from the
principle as follows: 1) the requirement for the invariance of the eld action s under
the action of a nitely dimensional lie group leads to the existence of conserved cur-
rents (noether theorem); 2) the generalization of the invariance of the action under
the global gauge transformations to the local ones introduces in the coupling of the
currents through a gauge eld. in fact it is just the second step, i.e. the replacement
of  in action by d, that enables us to have complete theories to describe the matter
elds and the interactions coupling matters. the quantized gauge eld model (stan-
dard model) has been successful to a large extent in explaining and predicting the
experimental results in elementary particle physicsfor an overview, see e.g. ref.[1].
the invariance of eld action, or more exactly the invariance of lagrangian density
under gauge transformations, constitutes the basis for dierential formalism of a gauge
eld theory. according to it, two eld models hl, a, i and hl, a
, i are equiva-
lent if they are related to each other by the form invariance of lagrangian density l,
and therefore by the invariance of local eld equations, under gauge transformations
including the global (gt1) and local (gt2a for matter eld and gt2b for gauge eld)
ones. here we have used the notations in ref.[2]. it is assumed as a matter of course
that other formalisms of gauge eld theory, e.g. integral formalism [3], should be the
same as the dierential one with respect to the inherent gauge symmetry. to meet
the requirement, the gauge transformation of a parallel transportor, the counterpart of
gauge eld a(x) in integral formalism, should be a two-point spinor1, i.e. that to be
aected only by the gauge transformation gt2a at the two end points which the par-
allel transportor connects. contrary to this assumption, however, we prove that there
is generally no two-point spinor property for a parallel transportor in a non-abelian
gauge eld theory and, therefore, the gauge freedom for a non-abelian theory is much
more restricted than what we see from dierential point of view on gauge theories.

in this paper, we rst clarify in the framework of bre bundle some commonly used
terminologies such as gauge transformation and gauge invariance, then give a denition
of gauge invariant eld theory in terms of the invariance of physical observables. after
proving the equivalence of gauge transformation gt2b and two-point spinor property of
innitesimal parallel transportor in the form of one-order expansion, we will study the
property of nite parallel transportor under gauge transformations in detail. finally,
some related issues will be discussed.

1here the notion is adopted in analogy to two-point tensor [4,5] for parallel transportor of a

tensor eld in spacetime manifold.

2 gauge transformation and gauge invariance

in this section we begin with the clarication of some terminologies regarding a gauge
eld theory, which are by no means uniform throughout the literature. we here adopt
the denition of gauge theory in ref.[2]:

a gauge eld theory is the one that is derived from the gauge prin-
ciple2 and represents the geometry of a principal bre bundle. the gauge
group is given by the structure group of the bundle.

since the geometrical framework of bre bundle provides a natural mathematical set-
ting for the representation of physical gauge theories, we will largely use the language
for the clarication of the terminologies we will use in our study.

a principal bre bundle is dened as a tuple he, m, , gi with bundle space e, base
space m, projection map : e  m, and structure group g which is homeomorphic to
bre space f . the base space m we study in this paper is minkowskian or euclidean
spacetime for simplicity.
in bre bundle language a matter eld is given as a cross
section in the associated vector bundle of principle bundle.
it is a smooth map :
m  e, which satises   (x) = x for x  m. of course there is no continuous
cross section unless the principle bundle is with a trivial topology, i.e. the product of
base and bre space. to describe gauge eld a(x) (throughout the paper a is the
t a, where t as are the generators of the lie algebra of
gauge group), we need to identify ia(x), where  is the coupling constant, with the
local representation b(x) [6, p. 160] of connection form , which is given as [7, p. 255]

short handed symbol for

aa

dimg

pa=1

 = g1(x)dg(x) + g1(x)b(x)g(x)dx

(1)

in the local coordinate : (g(x), x) ( g  g, x  m), and which determines a unique
decomposition t e = p e  he of the tangent space t e of the principal bundle e
into a perpendicular and a horizontal part.

cross section at each point x  u, an arbitrary neighborhood in base space, can be
regarded locally as an element of gauge group. a choice of a cross section is equivalent
to the choice of a local coordinate if we take the cross section as the origin of local
bre space. therefore the local gauge transformations gt2a and gt2b can be derived
from the transformation of local coordinates

t = 1

   : g  u  g  u

(2)

in bundle space. if there are two cross sections 1(x) and 2(x) in bundle space e
related to the neighborhood u, they are obviously connected by a spacetime dependent
gauge group action, i.e. there exists a g(x)  g such that

2the above-mentioned gauge symmetry principle is close to the denition of gauge postulate in

ref.[2], and should be distinguished from the term gauge principle there.

2(x) = g(x)1(x),

(3)

since they are in the same bre fx over each x  u. thus we have got gauge transfor-
mation gt2a. to obtain gauge transformation gt2b, we will make use of connection
form eq.(1). in two dierent coordinates (g1(x), x) and (g2(x), x), if a connection form
is given as [7, p. 256]

e = g1

1 (x)dg1(x) + g1

1 (x)b(1)

 (x)g1(x)dx

= g1

2 (x)dg2(x) + g1

2 (x)b(2)

 (x)g2(x)dx,

(4)

then the relation of the local representations of connection form is therefore found to
be

b(2)

 (x) = g(x)

g1
x (x) + g(x)b(1)

 (x)g1(x),

(5)

where g = g1g1
2 . gauge transformation gt2b has been derived in this way if the local
representation b(x) is identied with the gauge eld ia. from eq. (3) and eq.
(5) we obviously see that the local coordinate transformation eq. (2) can be realized
by any c 1 gauge group element g(x) (with continuous rst derivatives with respect
to spacetime coordinates x), which also preserves the invariance of the eld action
constructed by (x) and a(x). in this sense we call a c 1 coordinate transformation
t(x) a general local gauge transformation.

in eq.

(3) the action of gauge group is performed in the same bre over each
point in the base space, so we call it perpendicular action of gauge group. with
connection form  we can also dene another type of action of gauge group, that is,
parallel transport of bres from one point in base space to another. it involves dierent
points in base space, so it is termed horizontal action of gauge group. in this paper
we denote a parallel transportor, the gauge group element which implements such
action, as (b; x, x0), where the transport path  is an arbitrary piecewise smooth
curve which connects two end points, say x0 and x, and is parametrized by the path
variable t. as a point in bre space, cross section (x) is transported accordingly:

(x) = (b; x, x0)(x0)

(6)

parallel transport is determined by the horizontal direction of the bundle space [7,
p. 253]:

 = 1d + 1bdx = 0.

(7)

over a smooth segment of the path on which there is a denite tangent vector eld,
dx(t)/dt, it is equivalent to the following matrix dierential equation:

d
dt

(t) = b(t)(t),

(t0) = i,

(8)

(9)

where (t) = (b(t); t, t0), and b(t) = b(x(t))dx(t)/dt. there are two types of the
solution to the equation:

(t) = p exp(cid:18)z t

t0

dsb(s)(cid:19) = i +z t

t0

dsb(s)

+z t

t0

dsb(s)z s

t0

ds1b(s1) +    +z t

t0

dsb(s)   z sn1

t0

dsnb(sn) +    ,

(10)

for the case of non-abelian gauge group, and

(t) = exp(cid:18)z t

t0

dsb(s)(cid:19)

(11)

for the case of abelian gauge group, since the dierential equation in the latter case
reduces to an ordinary linear dierential equation. a parallel transportor along a
piecewise smooth curve or a gauge group element of horizontal action is therefore given
as the product of these operators dened on the monotonic smooth segments. naturally
there is the accompanying dierential equation for parallel transport of matter eld:

d
dt

(t)  ia(x(t))

dx
dt

(t)(t) = d(x(t))

dx
dt

(t) = 0,

(t0) = 0.

(12)

(13)

from these results it is concluded that, under a parallel transport, the total wave
function for a matter eld not only changes its amplitude but also undergoes a rotation
in the internal space such as isospin space in su(2) gauge theory.

parallel transportor plays an important role in integral formalism of gauge theory.
it adequately describes all physics contained in the gauge theory and, moreover, the
summation of it is a physically measurable quantity because it denes the transition
amplitude of a particle moving along a classical trajectory in the presence of gauge eld

a. for overviews of gauge eld theories with  = p exphc a(x)dx as the dynamical

variable (loop space formalism), see e.g. ref.[8, chap. 7], ref.[9, chap. 4]

we are now in a position to dene gauge invariance, the central concept in gauge
eld theory. following the denition of gauge eld theory in ref.[2] cited at the begin-
ning of the section, we give the denition as follows:

a gauge invariant eld theory is a gauge eld theory which is in-
variant under the bundle coordinate transformation t, that is, all the
observables including the local and non-local ones should be invariant un-
der its induced transformations gt1 and gt2. the classication of global
and local invariant theories is according to whether t is spacetime de-
pendent or not.

obviously from this denition we see that the gauge freedom of a gauge eld theory is
comprised of the actions of gauge group that preserve the invariance of the theory. the
distinction of the denition from those elsewhere lies in the invariance of the non-local
operators, such as (x2)(a; x2, x1)(x1), the operator for the bound state wave
function [10]. should the operator be invariant under local gauge transformations, the
parallel transportor must be a two-point spinor, i.e. it transforms as follows:

(a

; x2, x1) = g(x2)(a; x2, x1)g1(x1),

(14)

under the local gauge transformations. in bre bundle language we can say that only
the commutation of perpendicular action and horizontal action of gauge group can
guarantee a coordinate-free description of physics contained in a gauge theory.
in
addition to the gauge xing terms which are introduced in the lagrangian density for
the appropriate physical situations, this requirement imposes more restriction on the
gauge freedom of a gauge theory, because we will prove later that it doesnt generally
hold in non-abelian gauge theories.

3 joint of dierential and integral formalism

in practice a parallel transportor (x, x0) can be expressed as innite product of local
operator too. it is obtained through discretization of eq. (8):

(t + )  (t)



= b(t)(t)

the solution of the dierence equation is

(t + n) = lim
n

0

yi=n1

(i + b (i )) (t0).

(15)

(16)

if there is a denite tangent vector at each point of a segment of the parallel transport
path, we get the alternative form for a parallel transportor over the segment:

p expz t

t0

dsa(s) = lim
t0

(i + a(tn1)t)    (i + a(t0)t),

(17)

where a(ti) = ia(x(ti))dx(ti)/dt, i = 1, 2,    , n  1.

innitesimal parallel transportor i + iadx bridges over the connection between
dierential and integral formalism of gauge theory. when x  0, one-order approx-
imation

g(x + x)  g(x) +

g(x)
x x

(18)

can be regarded to be an exact equality, and therefore we nd that innitesimal parallel
transportor i + iadx transforms as a two-point spinor under gauge transformation
gt2b:

i + ia

dx =  g(x) +

g(x)

x dx! (i + iadx) g1(x)

= g(x + dx)(i + iadx)g1(x).

(19)

the equivalence of gauge transformation gt2b (eq. (5)) and two-point spinor property
of innitesimal parallel transportor ((eq. (19)) is proved in appendix a.

two-point spinor property for an innitesimal parallel transportor is crucial for the
in terms of innitesimal
invariance of parallel transport equation of  (eq. (12)).
parallel transportor the covariant change of (x), which means the dierence of the
eld at x and that parallelly transported from x + dx, can be expressed as

cov(x) = (i  ia(x)dx)(x + dx)  (x) = d(x)dx

(20)

under local gauge transformation it is transformed according to eq. (3) and eq. (19)
to

cov(x) = g(x)  

x  ia(x)! (x)dx

thus parallel transport equation for (x), which can also be express as

cov/t = 0,

lim
t0

(21)

(22)

is invariant as long as innitesimal parallel transportor is a two-point spinor. this is
consistent with the invariance of the horizontal direction in bundle space under the
action of structure group.

with the higher orders terms taken into account, an innitesimal parallel trans-
portor can of course be expressed as exp(ia(x)dx). but there is no two-point
spinor property for such an expression, i.e.

exp(ia

(x)dx) 6= g(x + dx)exp(ia(x)dx)g1(x).

it can be checked out by comparing the coecients of dx, dxdx,    on the both
hand sides of the inequality. if exp(ia(x)dx) remains to be a two-point spinor, the
expansion to the order of dxdx (comparing the coecient of dxdx on the both
sides), for example, leads to the following gauge transformation gt2b of the tensor
a(x)a(x):

a

(x)a

(x) = g(x)a(x)a(x)g1(x)

+ (i)2g(x)g1(x) + 2(i)1g(x)a(x)g1(x),

(23)

while the expansion only up to the order dx reproduces the gauge transformation of
a(x) as in eq. (5). from eq. (5), however, we have the tensor a(x)a(x) transforms
as

a

(x)a

(x) = g(x)a(x)a(x)g1(x) + (i)1g(x)a(x)g1(x)

 (i)1g(x)a(x)g1(x)  (i)2g(x)g1(x).

(24)

therefore, we will only use the one-order form of innitesimal parallel transportor in
the innite product expression of parallel transportor such as eq. (17).

4 properties of parallel transportor in non-abelian

gauge theory

from eq. (17) there are obviously the following three properties of parallel transportor

2 1(a) = 2(a)1(a);

(a) = ((a))1;

(cac 1) = c(a)c 1.

here  denotes the inverse path of  and c is a global gauge transformation.

in this section we primarily apply ourselves to the study of the property of non-
abelian parallel transportor under local gauge transformation. it was always taken for
granted that nite parallel transportor should be a two-point spinor too, since it can be
pieced together with innite number of innitesimal parallel transportor, which have
been proved to be two-point spinors. along with the analysis on the causes for the
false statement, we will give a detailed study on parallel transport equation, nite and
innitesimal parallel transportor and their connection under gauge transformations.

4.1

investigation into dierential equation eq. (8) and eq.
(12)

the dierential equation that determines the parallel transport of matter eld (x)
(eqs. (8) and (12)) is of the type

dx
dt

(t) = w (t)x(t).

let us study the behavior of the equation under the transformation

substituting eq. (26) into eq. (25), we have

x(t) = l(t)y(t).

(25)

(26)

d
dt

(l(t)y(t)) =

dl
dt

(t)y(t) + l(t)

dy
dt

(t) = w (t)l(t)y(t).

(27)

then eq. (25) is transformed to

dy
dt

(t) = w (t)y(t),

with

w (t) = l1(t)

d
dt

l(t) + l1(t)w (t)l(t).

(28)

(29)

the relation between w and w  is just that of gauge transformation gt2b if l1 is
identied with gauge group element g and, therefore, it is concluded that

(t) = p exp(cid:18)z t

t0

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0) = g(t)p exp(cid:18)z t

t0

dsa(s)(cid:19) g1(t0)(t0).

(30)

seemingly the procedure will lead to the conclusion eq. (14), but denitely it has
only proved the two-point spinor property of the parallel transportor when the eld
(t) is parallelly transported over a one-dimensional range [t0, t], a trivial eld theory,
because all the operations in the procedure are stuck to the one-dimensional range
[t0, t] and the integral in eq. (30) should be interpreted as a one-variable integral. in
any one-dimensional situation we can always nd a local gauge transformation gt2b
that makes gauge eld a(t) vanish identically because the dierential equation

dg
dt

(t)g1(t) + g(t)a(t)g1(t) = 0

(31)

has denite solutions, then the two-point spinor property holds absolutely (see ap-
pendix b). in fact, a parallel transport path should be regarded as the map [t0, t]  m
rather than [t0, t] itself. the point will be clearly seen through the discussion in the
next subsection.

a special case involving the solution of eq. (8) that needs to be claried is periodic
a(s). without the loss of generality we suppose a(s + 2) = a(s). then for a parallel
transport path, [0, 4]  m, we have

(4, 2)(2, 0) = p exp(cid:18)z 4

2

dsa(s)(cid:19) p exp(cid:18)z 2

0

dsa(s)(cid:19) .

its term of the order (i)2 is

z 2

0

dsa(s)z s

0

dsa(s) +z 4

2

dsa(s)z s

2

dsa(s) +z 4

dsa(s) + (z 2

dsa(s))2,

(32)

with the presence of the periodic function a(s).

if the (i)2 term of (4, 0) =
0 dsa(s) according to
0 dsa(s) in it is indenite due to the changing period

0 dsa(s)r s

0 dsa(s) should also be formally given as r 4

p expr 4
eq. (10), the integral factor r s

2 of a(s). to guarantee a denite group composition law:

(4, 2)(2, 0) = (4, 0),

we must specify that the parallel transportor constructed by a periodic a(s) should be
expressed as the product of those along the monotonic one, i.e. (2n, 0) = n(2, 0)
in the example.

4.2

investigation into innite product eq. (17)

to see if the two-point spinor property of nite parallel transportor, a non-local op-
erator, can be obtained through piecing together two-point spinor property of local
innitesimal parallel transportor, we need to study the innite product form of nite
parallel transportor eq. (17), since we have proved that an innitesimal parallel trans-
portor will be a two-point spinor only when it is in the form of one-order expansion.
the transport path, [t0, t]  m, is divided into countably innite small range [ti, ti+1],
for i = 0, 1,    , n, then a nite parallel transportor after gauge transformation gt2
becomes the following path-ordered innite product:

(a

(x); t, t0) = (i + a(tn1)t)    (i + a(t1)t)(i + a(t0)t),

(33)

 (x(ti)) dx/dt(ti), and t  0. with the two-point spinor prop-
where a(ti) = ia
erty of an innitesimal parallel transportor in the form of the one-order expansion along
the transport path, it is equal to

(u(tn1) + u(tn1)) (i+a(tn1)t)u 1(tn1) (u(tn2) + u(tn2)) (i+a(tn2)t)   

   (u(t0) + u(t0)) (i + a(t0)t)u 1(t0),

where u(t) = g(x(t)). if we take

u(ti+1) = u(ti) + u(ti) = u(ti) +

du
dt

(ti)t

(34)

for i = 1, 2,    , n  1, then all the group elements in the middle will be canceled in
couples and a two-point spinor (a(x); t, t0) will be obtained.

to check the validity of the argument, we can study the relation of the gauge group
elements at the two end points of the transport path. the simplest case is a smooth
group element function u(t) on the transport path, i.e. there are innite-th partial
derivatives with respect to spacetime variables at each point of the path, [t0, t]  m.
according to eq. (34), the gauge group elements are related by iterative one-order
expansion along the transport path, so we obtain the following relation (see appendix
c) of the gauge group elements at the end points of a smooth transport path:

u(t) = u(tn1) +

du
dt

(tn1)t

= u(tn2) + 2

xk=0  n

k ! (

)ku(t0)(t)k,

(35)

where t = (t  t0)/n. when n  , it reduces to the taylor expansion in variable t:

u(t) = u(t0) + (t  t0)u (t0) +

1
2!

(t  t0)2u (2)(t0) +    .

(36)

changing the variable of dierentials t to spacetime variables x, we have

g(x) = g(x0) +



xk=1

1

k!  (x  x

0 )



x!k

g(x0).

(37)

this is not denitely consistent with the taylor expansion of g(x) directly with respect
to spacetime variables x, if g(x) is only a c k(k < ) function on the subset of m, into
which the parallel transport path is embedded. the relation of the taylor expansion
in path parameter t and spacetime variables x is given in appendix d. from the above
discussion it can be seen that it is improper to treat the parallel transport of matter
eld on m as a one-dimensional problem in the parameter space [t0, t].

4.3 direct verication

the loss of the two-point spinor property for a nite parallel transportor in non-abelian
case can be directly checked out, if the parallel transport path is identied with a
spacetime curve ([t0, t]  m). in this sense, the dierential form a(t)dt related to
the gauge eld a(x) in all the concerned equations must be treated not only as the
one-form in parameter space [t0, t] but also as the one-form a(x)dx in the spacetime
manifold m.

in the parameter space [t0, t] alone, we have

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0)  (t0)
dsa(s) +   (cid:19) (t0)

t0

(t)  (t0) = p exp(cid:18)z t

dsa(s)(cid:19) (t0) = z t

t0

t0

dsa(s)(s),

(38)

where a(s) = ia(x(s))dx(s)/ds.

for a smooth loop, [0, 2]  m, on m, it corresponds to

(x0) = ii dza(z)p exp(cid:18)iz z

x0

dya(y)(cid:19) (x0),

(39)

giving the change of (x) after the parallel transportor along the loop. similarly, from
the invariance of the parallel transport equation of (x) under gauge transformation,
the change expressed by a

(x) and (s) is as follows:

(x0) = ii dza

(z)p exp(cid:18)iz z

x0

dya

(y)(cid:19) (x0).

(40)

if the parallel transportor in the equation is a two-point spinor, then we will obtain

(x0) = i dz [ig(z)a(z) + g(z)]p exp (iz z

x0

dya(y))(x0),

(41)

together with the the gauge transformations of a(x) and (x). obviously, (x0)
should be a gauge covariant quantity, i.e.

(x0) = g(x0)(x0).

(42)

however, from eq.
x0 dza(z) is a path-independent one, which means (see, e.g. ref.[11, p. 8])

(41), it can be true only when the line integral

dza(z) +   )0

= ia(x)p exp(cid:18)iz x

x0

dza(z)(cid:19) 0,

(43)

then the right hand side of eq. (41) can be transformed to

ii dzg(z)a(z)p exp(cid:18)iz z

x0

dya(y)(cid:19) (x0)i dzg(z)(cid:18)p exp (iz z

x0

dya(y)) (x0)(cid:19)

+i dz(cid:18)g(z)p exp (iz z

x0

dya(y))(x0)(cid:19) = g(x0)(x0)

(44)

through integral by parts.

or else, following the similar practice of dealing with the parallel transport of a
vector eld in riemannian space (see, e.g. ref.[12, p. 300]) by applying stokes theorem
to the equivalent integral equation of eq. (12):

(x0) = ii dza(z)(z),

(x0) = i/2z zs

d(z)f (z)(z),

we have

and

(x0) = i/2z zs

d(z)g(z)f(z)(z),

if the partial dierential equation

(x) = ia(x)(x)

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

is supposed to have a solution on m. therefore, eq. (42) will be valid only in two
special cases: 1) under the global gauge transformations gt1; 2)a pure gauge situation
where f(x) vanishes identically. as has been given by a similar result in the parallel
transport of a vector eld in riemannian space [13, p 167], the requirement, f(x) = 0
identically, is the sucient and necessary condition for the integrability of a non-
integrable phase factor, parallel transportor, constructed from a(x) and, therefore,

the condition for the equivalence of the ordinary dierential equation eq. (12) and the
partial dierential equation eq. (48). only when the condition is satised, will the
spinor eld (t) produced by the parallel transport of (x0) be in coincidence with
the solution of dirac equation. here we nd this requirement is also the sucient and
necessary condition for the two-point spinor property of a parallel transportor under
local gauge transformations, hence that for the invariance of a non-abelian gauge
theory under local gauge transformations.

another way to directly show the point is to compare the (i)n order terms on the

both sides of the undetermined equation:

p exp(cid:18)iz x

x0

dza

(z)(cid:19) ?= g(x)p exp(cid:18)iz x

x0

dza(z)(cid:19) g1(x0),

(49)

where

and

g(x) = exp (i

dimg

xa=1

a(x)t a) = exp (im(x)) = i + im(x) +    ,

dimg

g1(x0) = exp (i

a(x0)t a) = exp (im(x0)).

xa=1

after the gauge transformation of a(z) is substituted into the left hand side of
eq. (49), we compare the terms of the order (i)2. the terms of the order with the
permutation ma3 on the left hand side of eq. (49) are as follows:

(i)2z x

x0

dzm(z)a(z) + (i)2z x
 (i)2z x

m(z)d(cid:18)z z

x0

x0

x0

dm(z)z z

x0

(dz)a(z) = (i)2z x

x0

dzm(z)a(z)

(dz)a(z)(cid:19) + (i)2m(x)z x

x0

dza(z).

(50)

if the integrals here are interpreted as one-variable integrals in [t0, t], i.e. ir z
r s

t0 dsa(s) and a(s)ds = ia(z)dz, there is

x0(dz)a(z) =

d(cid:18)z s

t0

dsa(s)(cid:19) = a(s)ds

(51)

as an identity, and the two sides of eq. (49) will agree up to all orders, as it is always
true for the one-dimensional situation. however, as a matter of fact, eq. (51) implies

d(cid:18)iz z

x0

(dz)a(z)(cid:19) = ia(z)dz,

(52)

which is true on m only when a(z)dz is an exact form, i.e. a(z)  a(z) = 0
identically (see e.g. ref.[11, p. 10]). therefore, the consistency for the validity of eq.
(49) on [t0, t] with that on m doesnt always hold.

5 abelian gauge theory and aharonov-bhom eect

the gauge eld theory proper with gauge group u(1) is a special type in our dis-
cussion. the quantized u(1) gauge eld (quantum electrodynamics) well describes
electromagnetic interaction in nature. the variation of its lagrangian density

l(x) = 

1
4

f(x)f (x) + (x) (id  m) (x)

with respect to eld (x) leads to dirac equation

(id  m) (x) = 0,

(53)

(54)

where d = iea. in the region of spacetime where eld strength f(x) identically
vanishes, it can be reduced to the equation of free eld

through a phase factor called schwinger string [14]:

(i  m) f (x) = 0

(x) = exp(cid:18)iez x

x0

a(z)dz(cid:19) f (x).

(55)

(56)

in the non-relativistic limit, this mathematical transformation corresponds to a
physical phenomena. it is the famous aharonov-bohm experiment that directly demon-
strates the eect of gauge potential a on electron eld [15,16]. the experiment is
arranged to allow two beams of electron from a single source to pass either side of a
round coil and impinge on a screen behind. the magnetic eld is restricted to within
the coil so that eld tensor f in where electrons pass is identically zero. if the origin
of the space coordinate is chosen at the center of the coil, the one-form of the gauge eld
will be a(x)dx = y/(x2 + y2)dx + x/(x2 + y2)dy, which cannot be transformed to
zero by a c  gauge transformation because it is not the dierential of a function over
m/(0, 0) [11, p. 6]. hence we have a double-connected region on m. the interference
pattern at each point x on the screen is determined by the amplitude,

|f1(x)exp(cid:18)iez1

dza(z)(cid:19) + f2(x)exp(cid:18)iez2

dza(z)(cid:19) |2

= |f1(x)exp(cid:18)ie/2z z

d(z)(a(z)  a(z)(cid:19) + f2(x)|2,

(57)

where the integral domain is over the cross section of the coil, , since the eld strength
vanishes identically outside. the amplitude is invariant under the local gauge trans-
formations:

(x) = exp (ie(x)) (x),

a

(x) = a(x) + (x),

(58)

(59)

because the eld strength f(x) is gauge invariant.

if a double-connected region can be realized in a non-abelian situation, i.e. the
magnetic eld in the experiment would be taken place by some non-abelian gauge
eld and the electron eld by some fermion eld coupling to the non-abelian gauge
eld, the corresponding amplitude of eq. (57) will be

|p exp(cid:18)iz1

dza(z)(cid:19) f1(x) + p exp(cid:18)iz2

dza(z)(cid:19) f2(x)|2

= |f1(x)|2 + |f2(x)|2 + |+

f2(x)p exp(cid:18)ii

dza(z)(cid:19) f1(x) + h.c.|2,

(60)

where  = 1  2 with the point x0 as the initial and nal point. the phase factor
here can be calculated with the help of non-abelian stokes theorem [17,18]:

p exp(cid:18)ii

dza(z)(cid:19) = p exp(cid:18)iz x0

y

a(z)dz(cid:19) p exp(cid:18)i/2z z

d(z)f (y, z)(cid:19)

 p exp(cid:18)iz y

x0

a(z)dz(cid:19) ,

(61)

where y is an arbitrary reference point on , and

f(y, z) = p exp (iz y

z

adx)f(z)p exp (iz z

y

adx).

with regard to eq. (61), the contribution to the amplitude involving the phase factor
around the coil becomes

|+

f2(x)g1(x)p exp(cid:18)iz

a

(z)dz(cid:19) g(x)f1(x) + h.c.|2,

after the local gauge transformations gt2a and gt2b induced by t(x). here  =
c s1 c, with s1 the boundary of the coil and c arbitrary path connecting x0 and s1.
it is not equal to the corresponding part in eq. (60) because x 6  and the local gauge
transformations of the phase factor only involve the gauge group elements on the path
. the amplitude is therefore invariant only under global gauge transformation gt1.
without the consideration of the connement of fermions in non-abelian gauge eld
theories, this imaginary experiment demonstrates that only abelian gauge eld theory
is a perfect locally invariant gauge theory in the sense of the denition in sect.(2), i.e.
a coordinate-free description of physics can be realized only in u(1) bundle space.

6 discussions

both in model construction [19,20,21] and lattice simulation [22], non-perturbative ap-
proaches to qcd widely involves the application of parallel transportor. the closed

parallel transportor (wilson loop) is an important tool for the study of the non-
perturbative phenomena such as the connement of quarks (see, e.g. ref.[8, chap. 5]).
however, the explicit broken of the local gauge symmetry of the quantities constructed
with this non-local operator, parallel transportor, was not understood before. in the
perturbative domain, an innitesimal parallel transportor can be regarded as a good
approximation to the real one, because of the aymptotic freedom property for non-
abelian gauge theories. its two-point spinor property preserves the local gauge invari-
ance gt2 in the perturbative domain. whether the loss of two-point spinor property
of parallel transportor in non-perturbative domain implies some physics requires our
further study.

another issue closely related to gauge symmetry is spacetime symmetry in the ge-
ometrized theories of gravitation, e.g. general relativity. the concept of gauge invari-
ance in fact originated from h. weyls attempt [23] to unify gravitation and electromag-
netism in the framework of riemannian geometry. general relativity was rst treated
as orthonormal frame bundle with the homogeneous lorentz group as the structure
group in ref.[24]. for a conceptual development of gauge concept and geometrization
of fundamental interactions, see ref.[25]. the largest symmetry in spacetime theories
is the invariance of the local eld equations under local coordinate transformation.
people used to believe that this group of diermorphism comprises the gauge freedom
of any theory formulated in terms of tensor elds on a spacetime manifold m, and
therefore all diermorphic models of any spacetime theory represent one and the same
physical situation. hence the term general covariance for a theory usually means
the invariance of local eld equations under coordinate transformation. for a genuine
equivalence of physics, however, the tensor elds at every point of spacetime manifold
should be in exact correspondence through the related transformation law, i.e.
for a
tensor eld t on spacetime manifold m there is t  = ht , if h is a diermorphism from
m to m . for example, if a physical process involves the parallel transport of a vector
eld n(x) between two points, say x1 and x2, on spacetime manifold, the parallel

transportor p exp(cid:16)r x2

x1 

(x)dx(cid:17) of the the vector eld must be a two-point vec-

tor. generally speaking, the parallel transport of tensor elds should be an absolute
element [26] in any spacetime theory, i.e. the concerned spacetime transformations
should map these operators in one model to the corresponding parallel transportors in
all its equivalent models. this requirement imposes stronger condition for the general
covariance of the theory than that of the form invariance of local lagrangian density.
following the argument in this paper we can show the loss of the property in the general
situation through the analysis of parallel transportors for tensor elds. when studied
from integral point of view, the two most fundamental symmetries, general covariance
and gauge invariance, are shown to be much more restricted than what we see from
dierential point of view.

appendix a

in this appendix we prove the equivalence of eq. (5) and eq. (19).
eq. (5) = eq. (19): eq. (5) can be rearranged as

ia

(x)dx = g(x)dg1(x) + g(x)ia(x)dxg(x)1.

(a.1)

adding unit matrix i to both sides we have

i + ia

(x)dx = g(x)g1(x)  g(x)dg1(x) + g(x)ia(x)dxg(x)1

= g(x)g1(x  dx) + g(x)ia(x)dxg(x)1.

only with the one-order approximation taken into account, there is

g(x)ia(x)dxg(x)1 = g(x)ia(x)dxg(x  dx)1,

and two-point spinor property of innitesimal parallel transportor:

i + ia

(x)dx = g(x)(i + ia(x)dx)g1(x  dx).

(a.2)

(a.3)

(a.4)

eq. (19) = eq. (5): it is obviously from the comparing of the terms of dx on

both sides of eq. (19).

appendix b

in this appendix we prove the two-point spinor property for parallel transportor
when the gauge eld a(x) can be transformed to zero identically. it is in fact to prove

p exp(cid:18)iz x

x0

dza(z)(cid:19) = p exp(cid:18)z x

x0

dzg(z)g1(z)(cid:19) = g(x)g1(x0),

(b.1)

where g(z) = exp(i a(z)t a) = expim(z). we have

g(z)g1(z) =   
xk=0

1
k!

(im(z))k!   
xk=0

(1)k

k!

(im(z))k! .

(b.2)

substituting it into (b.1). we obtain innitely many terms containing m(z) as the

integral variable, such as r d(m l/l!)((1)n/n!)m n). all these terms can be grouped

into the (n+1)-element sets of the order (i)l+n+x in the form:

z   z si1

t0

d(m l/l!)

(1)k

k!

m kz si

t0

d 

1

(n  k)!

m nk! z    ,

for k = 0, 1,    , n, where the common factors d(cid:16)m l/l!(cid:17) contributes the order (i)l,
and the common part r    the order (i)x. we nd that the terms in such a group

(1)k(1/k!)(1/(n  k)!) = 0 from the identity

cancel all together, because

n

pk=0

(1  1)n = n!  n
xk=0

(1)k 1
k!

1

(n  k)!! = 0.

(b.3)

in this way only the terms on the right hand side of b.(1) will be left.

appendix c

here eq. (35) is proved by the induction on n: if k = 1, then for any dierentiable

function g(t) there is

g(t + t) = g(t) + dg/dt(t)t

(c.1)

under one-order approximation. suppose eq. (35) holds for k = n  1. then we have

g (t + (n  1)t) =

and

dg/dt (t + (n  1)t) =

n1

xk=0  n

k ! (d/dt)kg(t0)(t)k,

n1

xk=0  n

k ! (d/dt)kdg/dt(t0)(t)k.

(c.2)

(c.3)

when k = n, it immediately follows that

g (t + nt) = g (t + (n  1)t) + dg/dt (t + (n  1)t) t.

(c.4)

substituting c.2 and c.3 into c.4 and considering the relation

k ! =   n  1
  n

k  1 ! +  n  1

k

! ,

(c.5)

we obtain eq. (35) for k = n after the rearrangement of the terms.

appendix d

first we derive eq.

(36). remember that we suppose g(x) has
innite-th partial derivatives at each point on the path , [t0, t]  m. after the
variable t of the dierentials is changed to x, there are

(37) from eq.

du
dt

(t) =

dx
dt

(t)g(x),

d2u
dt2 (t) =

d2x
dt2 (t)g(x) +

dx
dt

(t)

dx
dt

(t)g(x),

etc. substituting these results into eq. (36), we obtain the coecient of g(x0) as
follows:

(t  t0)

(t0) +

dx
dt

(t  t0)2 d2x

1
2!

dt2 (t0) +    = x  x
0 ,

since the path is a smooth one. all the terms of the higher derivatives in eq. (37) are
obtained in the same way.

on the other hand, if there are continuous n-th partial derivatives of g(x) at each
0 )  m, then it can be expanded to the n-th order of (x  x
0 )

(x  x

point of w =

n

q=1

with respect to the spacetime variables. however, with some points z 6  but  w ,
at which the continuous partial derivatives exist only up to the m(< n  1)-th, g(x)
cannot be certainly expanded in the form:

g(x) = g(x0) +

n1

xk=1

1

k!  (x  x

0 )



x!k

g(x0) +

1

n!  (x  x

0 )



x!n

g(),

where  is some point in w .

as an example, we perform the local gauge transformation g(x, y) = exp (

(a(x, y))

4

3 t a),

dimg

pa=1

where a(x, y) are c  functions, on two-dimensional plane x-y. g(x, y) is a c 1 func-
tion over the domain w = [0, 1]  [0, 1] if there are a  w 6=  for some curves a
determined by the equations, a(x, y) = 0. consider a smmoth path  connecting the
point (0, 0) to (1, 1), with   a =  for all as. then u(t) is c  on . from the
taylor expansion of u(t) we have

g(1, 1) = g(0, 0) +



xk=1

1

k!   

x

+



y!k

g(0, 0),

whereas the taylor expansion of c 1 function g(x, y) on w only denitely gives

g(1, 1) = g(0, 0) + (


x

+


y

)g(1, 2),

where (1, 2) is some point in w . therefore, it is concluded that the coincidence of
the two taylor expansions eq. (36) and eq. (37) requires the same behavior of g(x)
on  and w .
