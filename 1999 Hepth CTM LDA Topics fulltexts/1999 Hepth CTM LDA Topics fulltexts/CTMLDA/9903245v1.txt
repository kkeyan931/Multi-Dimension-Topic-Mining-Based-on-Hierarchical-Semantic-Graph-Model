abstract

we describe new theories of composite vector and tensor (p-form) gauge elds made
out of zero-dimensional constituent scalar elds (primitives). the local gauge sym-
metry is replaced by an innite-dimensional global noether symmetry  the group of
volume-preserving (symplectic) dieomorphisms of the target space of the scalar primi-
tives. we nd additional non-maxwell and non-kalb-ramond solutions describing topo-
logically massive tensor gauge eld congurations in odd space-time dimensions. gen-
eralization to the supersymmetric case is also sketched.

1. introduction innite-dimensional symmetries play an increasingly important role
in various areas of physics. the current interest towards them is motivated mainly due to
the recent discovery of eective description of seiberg-witten theory in terms of integrable
models in lower space-time dimensions [1], as well as the role of w1+-algebra in the
eld-theoretic description of the quantum hall eect [2].

the hallmark of the completely integrable two-dimensional eld-theoretic models is the
presence of innite sets of conservation laws allowing for their exact solvability. it is however
dicult to nd a realistic eld theory in d = 4 space-time dimensions possessing an innite
number of nontrivial conserved charges. in the present note (which is an extension of our
work in ref.[3]) we will construct a series of new theories in higher space-time dimensions
allowing for an innite number of conservation laws, which at the same time closely resemble
the standard vector and tensor (p-form) gauge theories. the basic idea is to introduce the
ordinary gauge elds as composite elds built up of more elementary primitive scalar
eld constituents and to replace the ordinary local gauge symmetry with a global innite-
dimensional noether symmetry acting on the target space of the scalar primitives.

let us briey recall some basic notions connected with the innite-dimensional groups
di 0(t s) of volume-preserving dieomorphisms on (s-dimensional) smooth manifolds t s.
di 0(t s) is dened as the group of all dieomorphisms preserving the canonical volume
form 1

a=1 being a set of local coordinates) :

s! a1...as da1  . . .  das (with {a}s

di 0(t s)  (a  ga() ; b1...bs

gb1
a1 

gbs
as

= a1...as)

(1)

accordingly, the lie algebra diff 0(t s) of innitesimal volume-preserving dieomorphisms
is given by:

diff 0(t s)  (a() ; ga()  a + a() ,

b

b = 0)

i.e.,

a() =

1

(s  2)!

abc1...cs2


b c1...cs2()

(2)

(3)

in the simplest case s = 2 the algebra diff 0(t 2) coincides with the algebra of symplectic
bo
(area-preserving) dieomorphisms sdiff (t 2)  n() ; [ 1 , 2 ]  { 1 , 2 } = ab 1

which contains as a subalgebra the centerless conformal virasoro algebra and whose lie-
algebraic deformation is the well-known w1+-algebra.

2. composite p-form gauge theories let us consider a set of s( p + 1) zero-
dimensional scalar elds {a(x)}s
a=1 taking values in a smooth manifold t s. the pull-back of
its canonical volume s( p+1)-form to minkowski space-time gives rise to an antisymmetric
s-tensor gauge eld strength and its associated antisymmetric (s1)-tensor gauge potential:

1
s!

a1...asda1    das =

f1...s()dx1    dxs
f1...s() = a1...as 1 a1 . . . s as

1
s!

f1...s() = s[1 a2...s]()

, a1...s1() =

1
s

a1...as a1 1 a2 . . . s1 as

(4)

(5)

(6)

where the square brackets indicate total antisymmetrization of indices. one can easily verify
that the eld strength (5) is invariant under arbitrary eld transformations (reparametriza-
tions) a(x)  ga ((x)) belonging to the innite-dimensional group di 0(t s) (1), whereas
its potential (6) undergoes a -dependent (s  2)-rank local gauge transformation (cf. (2)
(3)):

now it is straightforward, upon using (5)(6), to construct eld-theory models of arbi-
trary p-form tensor gauge elds involving the scalar primitives a coupled to ordinary
matter (e.g., fermionic) elds, where the standard local p-form tensor gauge invariance is
substituted with the global innite-dimensional noether symmetry of volume-preserving
dieomorphisms on the s p + 1-dimensional target space of primitive scalar constituents.
the simplest model (for s = 2) is the so called mini-qed [3] : l =  1
 () +

4e2 f 2

 (i6  6a()  im)  , where f () and a() are given by (9) and (10), respectively.
similarly, the arbitrary higher rank p-form composite tensor gauge eld theories are de-
ned by:

1

2(p + 1)e2 z ddx f 2

s = 
where f1...p+1((x)) and a1...p((x)) are given by (5)(6). in particular, for s = 3 we
have a mini-kalb-ramond model:

1...p+1((x)) +z ddx a1...p((x)) j

1 ...p
matter (x) + smatter

(11)

s = 

1

3!e2 z ddx f 2

((x)) +z d2

abc a(x())1 b(x())2 c(x())

(12)

where the second integral is over the string world-sheet given by x = x().

let us particularly stress that, although the lagrangians of the composite p-form gauge
theories (11)(12) contain higher order derivatives w.r.t. a, they are only quadratic w.r.t.
time-derivatives. also, note that the chern-simmons terms and topolocal densities for
the composite p-form tensor gauge elds (5)(6) identically vanish in space-time dimensions
d = 2p + 1 and d = 2p + 2, respectively, e.g. :

1...2p+1 a1...p()fp+1...2p+1() =

1

p + 1

a1...ap+1 b1...bp+1 1...2p+1 a1 1 [a2 . . . p ap+1 p+1 b1 . . . 2p+1 bp+1] = 0 (13)

due to the total antisymmetrization of the 2p + 1 indices a2, . . . , ap+1, b1, . . . , bp+1 taking
only p + 1 values.

3. non-maxwell and non-kalb-ramond solutions the action (11) yields the

following equations of motion: ab1...bp1 b1 . . . p bph 1

0 upon variation w.r.t. a or, equivalently, upon multiplying the l.h.s. of the last equation
by a and accouting for (6) :

matter (x)i =

e2  f 1...p((x)) + j

1...p

a1...p((x))(cid:20) 1

e2 f 1...p((x)) + j

1...p

matter (x)(cid:21) = 0

(14)

from (14) we notice that any solution a1...p(x) of the standard p-form gauge theory, i.e.,
such a1...p(x) for which the term in the square brackets in (14) vanishes, is authomat-
ically a solution of the new composite p-form gauge theory (11) provided a1...p(x) is
representable (up to (p  1)-rank gauge transformation) in terms of scalar primitives as
in (6).
on the other hand, eqs.(14) possess additional solutions unattainable in ordinary p-
form gauge theories, namely such a1...p((x)) for which the corresponding factor in the
square brackets in (14) is non-zero:

1
e2 f 1...p((x)) + j

1...p

matter (x) + j 1...p((x)) = 0

(15)

where the additional current j 1...p obeys: a1...p((x))j 1...p((x)) = 0. an im-
mediate nontrivial example for j 1...p satisfying the latter constraint in odd space-time
dimensions d = 2p + 1 is (due to (13)) :

j 1...p((x)) =

1

(p + 1)!

1...p1...p+1f1...p+1((x))

(16)

so that eqs.(15) become the eqs. of motion of ordinary p-form gauge theory with additional
chern-simmons term. thus, if we succeed to nd a solution to:

1
e2 f 1...p +

1

(p + 1)!

1...p1...p+1f1...p+1 + j

1...p
matter = 0

(17)

which is expressible in terms of scalar primitives, we therefore obtain a non-maxwell/non-
kalb-ramond solution of eqs.(14).

we will present here such a solution of eqs.(14) in the free case j

1...p
matter (x) = 0 (for

simplicity, we consider the mini-kalb-ramond model (12)) :

a () f () = 0 , f ()+

e2
3!

1(x) = kx

, 2(x) = x

 f  () = 0 , f () = abcab c
(18)
(19)

, 3(x) = x [p sin(k.x) + q cos(k.x)]

where k, , p, q are constant 5-vectors obeying:

k2 (p  p)  e2 kq = 0 ,

p.k = p. = q.k = q. = k. = p.q = 2 = 0 ,

p2 = q2
k2 (q  q) + e2 kp = 0

(20)

hence, we nd from eqs.(18)(19) that composite p-form tensor gauge theories (11) exhibit
dynamical parity breakdown since they carry topologically massive excitations.

4. supersymmetric generalization here we will briey indicate the supersym-
metric generalization of (11) in the simplest case of interest: s = 2 (mini-super-qed) and
d = 4 (for superspace notations and denitions, see e.g. [4]). the supereld of the vector
supermultiplet (a, , 

) :

 and d are pure-gauge and auxiliary component elds, respectively, and

through the following simple formula:

in terms of component elds eq.(24) reads:

which are the supersymmetric generalization of (10). the superspace action of mini-super-
qed is obtained by replacing the supereld v (21) with its composite form (24) in the
well-known super-qed action:

5. outlook it is an interesting task to study in detail the supersymmetric composite p-
form gauge theories generalizing (26). of particular interest to modern string theory would
be to nd supersymmetric p-brane solutions in these theories extending the work in ref.[5],
where p-brane solutions have been obtained in the purely bosonic composite p-form tensor
gauge theories (11) when d = (p + 1) + (p + 1). on the other hand, the possibility of
dening volume forms in terms of primitive scalar elds as in (9) suggests the idea of

replacement of the standard measure of integration g in general-coordinate invariant
theories by the primitive scalar composite detkak (here p + 1 = d). the basic reasons
and advantages of this approach are discussed in separate contributions to these proceedings
(by e.i. guendelman and a.b. kaganovich and by e.i.guendelman)).
