abstract

the multi-instanton solutions by thooft and jackiw, nohl & rebbi are gen-
eralized to curvilinear coordinates. expressions can be notably simplied by the
appropriate gauge transformation. this generates the compensating addition to
the gauge potential of pseudoparticles. singularities of the compensating connec-
tion are irrelevant for physics but aect gauge dependent quantities.

the third connection

the years that passed since the discovery of instantons, [1], did not bring answer to the
question about the role of instantons in qcd, [2, 3]. as far as connement remains a
puzzle all references to instantons at long scales are ambiguous. indications may come
from studies of instanton eects in phenomenological models. these could tell whether
connement may seriously aect pseudoparticles and v. v.

common connement models look most natural in non-cartesian coordinate frames.
the obvious choice for bags are 3+1-cylindrical, i. e. 3-spherical+time, coordinates while
strings would prefer 2+2-cylindrical (2+1-cylindrical+time) geometry. nevertheless in-
stantons were usually discussed in the cartesian frame (that was ideal in vacuum). the
purpose of the present work is to draw attention to the problem and to develop the
adequate technique. we shall generalize to curvilinear coordinates the multi-instanton
solutions by thooft and jackiw, nohl & rebbi, [4], and simplify the formulae by the
gauge transformation. presently i dont know whether the procedure is good for other
topological congurations but i would expect that it makes sense for the ahdm, [5],
solution1.

we start from the basics of curvilinear coordinates in sect. 1.1 and introduce the rst
two connections, namely the levi-civita connection and the spin connection. in sect. 1.2
we describe the multi-instanton solutions. in sect. 2 we shall rewrite instantons in non-
cartesian coordinates and propose the gauge transform that makes formulae compact.
the price will be the appearance of the third, so called compensating, gauge connection.
the example of the o(4)-spherical coordinates is sketched in sect. 3. singularities of the
gauged solution are discussed in sect. 4. the last part summarizes the results.

the work is done with partial support of the rfbr grant 97-02-16131.

1 basics

1.1 curvilinear coordinates

we shall consider at 4-dimensional euclidean space-time that may be parametrized either
by the set of cartesian coordinates x or by curvilinear ones called q. the q-frame is
characterized by the metric tensor g(q):

ds2 = dx2

 = g(q) dq dq.

(1)

in the q-frame the derivatives


x should be replaced by the covariant ones, d. for

example the derivative of a covariant vector a is:

da = a  

 a.

(2)

the function 
the metric tensor (g g = 

):

 is called the levi-civita connection. it can be expressed in terms of



 =

1
2

g g
q +

g
q 

g

q ! .

often it is convenient to use instead of g the four vectors ea

 called the vierbein:

g(q) = ab ea

(q) eb

(q).

(3)

(4)

multiplication by ea

 converts coordinate (greek) indices into the vierbein (latin) ones,

aa = ea

 a.

(5)

covariant derivatives of quantities with latin indices are dened in terms of the spin

connection ra

 b(q),

daa = aa + ra

 b ab.

the two connections 

 and ra

 b are related to each other as follows:

ra

 b = ea

 e

b + ea

 

 e

b = ea

 (de)b.

we shall discuss pure euclidean yang-mills theory with the su(2) gauge group. the
vector potential is a = 1
 where  a are the pauli matrices. the (cartesian) covariant
derivative is d =   i a, and the action has the form:
d4x = z tr f f 

s = z tr f 2

g d4q.

(8)

where g = det||g||. the formula for the gauge eld strength f is universal:

f( a) =  a   a  i h a, ai .

(9)

the action is invariant under gauge transformations,

a  a

 =  a(x)  + i   ,

(10)

the eld equations have selfdual (f = f = 1

where  is a unitary 2  2 matrix,  = 1.
2  f ) solutions known as instan-
tons. the most general explicit selfdual conguration found by jackiw, nohl and rebbi,
[4], is:

where  is the matrix version of the thoofts -symbol, [6]:

a(x) =

 ln (x),

(11)

(12)

the widely used regular and singular instanton gauges as well as the famous thoofts

ansatz may be cast into the form similar to (11).

our aim is to generalize the solution (11) to curvilinear coordinates. we shall not

refer to the explicit form of (x) and the results will be applicable to all the cases.

2 multi-instantons in curvilinear coordinates

2.1 the problem and the solution
it is not a big deal to transform the covariant vector a, (11), to q-coordinates. however
this makes the constant numerical tensor  coordinate-dependent

   = 

x
q

x
q

.

(13)

we propose to factorize the coordinate dependence by means of the gauge transfor-

mation such that

  = ea
here ab is a constant numerical matrix tensor,

 eb



ab.

ab = 

a 

b  .

(14)

(15)

it takes the place of  in non-cartesian coordinates.

it can be shown that the matrix  does exist provided that the x-frame and the

q-frame have the same orientation and the two sides of (14) are of same duality.

the gauge-rotated instanton eld is the sum of the two pieces:

a
(q) = 

1
2

ea


ab eb   ln  (q) + i  .

(16)

the rst addend is almost traditional and does not depend on the -matrix whereas the
second one carries information about the q-frame. it is entirely of geometrical origin. we
call it the compensating connection because it compensates the coordinate dependence
of ab = e

b  and reduces it to the constant ab.

a e

so long we did not specify what was the duality of the -symbol. however the -
matrices and compensating connections for + and  are dierent. in general acomp 
are respectively the selfdual and antiselfdual projections of the spin connection onto the
gauge group:



acomp 



= i 

  = 

1
4

rab



ab.

(17)

the last formula does not contain  that has dropped out of the nal result. in order
to write down the multi-instanton solution one needs only the vierbein and the associated
spin connection.

2.2 triviality of the compensating eld.
the fact of the compensating connection acomp, (17), being a pure gauge is specic to
the at space. it turns out that the eld strength f( acomp) is related to the riemann
curvature of the space-time r 

:



f( acomp ) = 

1
4

r 




.

(18)

thus f( acomp) = 0 provided that r 
 = 0. simple changes of variables x  q do
not generate curvature and acomp is a pure gauge. however this is not the case in curved
space-times.

2.3 duality and topological charge

as long as we limit ourselves to identical transformations the vector potential (16) must
satisfy the classical eld equations. however the duality equation looks dierently in
non-cartesian frame. if written with coordinate indices it is:

f =

 f .

g
2

still it retains the familiar form in the vierbein notation:

fab =

1
2

abcd f cd.

the topological charge is given by the integral

q =

1

322 z  tr f  f  d4q,

which in the vierbein notation becomes

q =

1

322 z abcd tr f ab f cd g d4q.

(19a)

(19b)

(20a)

(20b)

the general expression for f in non-cartesian frame is rather clumsy but it simplies

for one instanton. the vector potential in regular gauge is, (r2 = x2

):

ai

 =

+

2

 ln(cid:16)r2 + 2(cid:17) .

4

(21)

the conjugated coordinate and + gauge transformations convert it into

ai

 =

1
2

ea


ab eb   ln(r2 + 2) + acomp +,

and the eld strength becomes plainly selfdual:

fab( ai ) = 

2 +

ab

(r2 + 2)2 ,

(22)

(23)

this generalizes regular gauge to any non-cartesian coordinates.

3 example

we shall consider an instanton placed at the origin of the o(4)-spherical coordinates.
those are the radius and three angles: q = (, , , r). the polar axis is aligned with
x1 and

x1 = r cos ;
x2 = r sin  sin  cos ;
x3 = r sin  sin  sin ;
x4 = r sin  cos .

the vierbein and the metric tensor are diagonal:

ea
 = diag (r, r sin  sin , r sin , 1).

(24a)
(24b)
(24c)
(24d)

(25)

now one may start from the vector potential (21) and consecutively carry out the
entire procedure. but to the calculation of the instanton part this includes calculating

, nding rab
ab, (12,
15). the result is:

 and, nally, computing acomp +. the +

ab-symbol coincides with +

4 singularities

note that the vector eld (26) is singular since neither ai
 goes to zero near polar
axes  = 0 and  = 0. these singularities are produced by the gauge transformation and
must not aect observables. however they may tell on gauge variant quantities. we shall
demonstrate that for the chern-simons number.

 nor ai

the topological charge, (20), can be represented by the surface integral, q = h k  ds,

[2, 3]. here,

even though q is invariant k  depends on gauge. consider cartesian instanton in the
a4 = 0 gauge. the two contributions to the topological charge come from the x4 = 
hyperplanes, q = ncs()  ncs(), and the quantity
k 4 ds4

(28)

ncs(t) = zx4=t

is called the chern-simon number. instanton is a transition between two 3-dimensional
vacua with ncs = 1.

analysis of (26) reveals a striking resemblance with this case. by coincidence here
again a4 = 0, (26d). this gives an idea to interpret r as a time coordinate attributing
the chern-simons number ncs(r) to the sphere of radius r. a naive expectation would
be that ncs = ncs(r)|
0 gives the topological charge. however this is not true and
ncs = 1
2. the second half of q is contributed by the singularities at  = 0, . the
-transform has aected the distribution of ncs.

we conclude that in our approach gauge variant quantities depend on coordinate frame
and may be localized at the singularities of the -transform. this may be one more way
to simplify calculations with the help of curvilinear coordinates.

summary

we have shown that explicit (multi-)instanton solutions can be generalized to curvilinear
coordinates. the gauge transformation converts the coordinate-dependent ab-symbol into
the constant ab. the gauge potential is a sum of the instanton part and the compensating
gauge connection, (16).

the compensating gauge connection can be computed in the three steps:

1. one starts from the calculation of the levi-civita connection 

, (3).

2. covariant dierentiation of the vierbein, (7), leads to the spin connection rab
 .

3. convolution of the spin connection with the appropriate ab gives the compensating

gauge potential, (17).

the advantage of our solution is that it is constructed directly of geometrical quanti-
ties, i. e. the vierbein and the spin connection. another attractive feature is the relation
between gauge variant quantities and the coordinate frame. more details may be found
in [7].
