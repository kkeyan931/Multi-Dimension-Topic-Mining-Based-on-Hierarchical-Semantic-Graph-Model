(13) li domain walls sit, ambiguous quantity (0), usually dene (0) = 0 (0) = 1. validity einstein equation requires us choose (0) = 1. thus rst sight meet inconsistency, various results depend ambiguous quantity. indeed, situation hand quantity close connection physical fact, namely, existence singularities location domain walls, careful treatment needed. article, order avoid ambiguous quantity (0), wish regularize model way introduce innitely small thickness domain walls take limit 0 calculations. regularization, ambiguity never occur. let us present two interesting solutions. solutions describe even domain walls standing along s1 intervals dimensional space-time. one solution given n1 2 f (z) = |z| + (1)i|z l2i| l, xi=1 (1)i(z l2i) + 1, f (z) = f (z) = 2 2 n1 2 n1 xi=1 xi=1 (1)i(z l2i), 4 (14) li satises relations l2i = l2i1 + l2i+1 2 , l1 = 0, ln = 2l, = 1, 2, , n1 2 . moreover, li (i = 1, 2, , n1 l2i = (1)i+1 6k 2rc . 2 ) must satisfy relations (15) (16) solution expresses n1 even domain walls locating l2i. paper, would like 2 take account one visible 3-brane many hidden 3-branes equal 1 n runs 5, 9, 13, . another interesting solution takes form n1 f (z) = f (z) = f (z) = 2 n1 (1)i+1|z li| + l, xi=2 (1)i+1(z li) 1, xi=1 xi=1 (1)i+1(z li), n1 (17) li also satises eq.(15). time, li (i = 1, 2, , n1 2 ) must satisfy relations 3k 2rc , l1 = ln = l2i = l2j+1 = 6k 2rc , (18) 0 < j < i. number domain walls even number n 1 (n takes values 3, 5, 7, ), domain walls located li (i = 1, 2, , n 1). stage, one might ask whether possible nd solution odd domain walls not. answer seem armative. reason orbifold geometry s1/z2 {$9906064$}, solutions obtained paper characteristic feature number positive energy branes equals number negative energy branes, resulting solutions always include even domain walls. let us turn main question. mass hierarchy problem resolved many universe model? see answer quite interest shows peculiar feature many universe model. first all, let us consider rst model (14). model, domain walls located z = l2i (i = 1, 2, , n1 2 ). let us suppose visible 3-brane (our universe) located certain z = l2i, whereas remaining 3-branes hidden sectors (the universes). wish measure mass scale world placed z = l2i mass scale hidden world placed z = l2j(i 6= j), assume 5 planck mass assigned. according formulas given {$9906064$}, general evaluate mass scale world using eqs.(12), (14): m(l2i) = u(l2i) u(l2j) m(l2j) = m(l2j) exp krc l2i l2j + n1 2 xl=1 (1)l (|l2i l2l| |l2j l2l|) . (19) compare result (19) {$9906064$}, let us rst recall result {$9906064$} see implications result two specic cases. setup ref.{$9906064$}, two 3-branes opposite sign potential energy. 3-brane positive potential energy, natural scale mass assumed order planck mass. standard model (our universe) placed another 3-brane negative potential energy, graviton amplitude exponentially suppressed exponential mass hierarchy generated. fact mind, let us see happens model. action (1) (16), turns 3-branes located z = l4i2 negative brane energy 3-branes z = l4i positive brane energy. thus, instance, let us calculate mass scale z = l2 mass scale z = l4, assume planck mass assigned. note situation similar {$9906064$} mentioned above. simple calculation yields m(l2) = m(l4)ekrc(l4l2). (20) result means exponential mass hierarchy also occurs present model {$9906064$}. note result universal sense essential behavior result remains unchanged long 3-brane negative brane energy hidden 3-brane positive brane energy even factor l4 l2 exponential changes depending 3-branes consider. interesting feature model existence many branes negative positive brane energy, led ask result mass hierarchy modied take account two 3-branes sign brane energy. specic, let us consider situation attempt measure mass scale z = l2 mass scale z = l6, 3-branes negative brane energy. case general result (19) reduces m(l2) = m(l6)e 1 2 krc(l3+l5l7), (21) implies also exponential mass hierarchy l3 + l5 > l7. inequality hold, planck mass scale allocated hidden sector exponentially enhanced larger mass scale world. easy check essential feature conclusion also universal far two 3-branes sign brane energy concerned. next, let us focus second model (17). model, domain walls located z = li (i = 1, 2, , n 1). again, simple calculation gives us m(li) = u(li) u(lj) m(lj) 6 = m(lj) exp(krc (1)l+1 (|li ll| |lj ll|)) . n1 xl=2 (22) action (1) (18), see 3-branes located z = l2i negative brane energy 3-branes z = l2i1 positive brane energy. thus, rst model, instance, let us calculate mass scale z = l2 mass scale z = l1 = 0, take planck mass. result form m(l2) = m(0)ekrcl2. (23) indeed, result {$9906064$}. (recall comparison set l2 .) interesting thing holds true even many hidden sectors topology circle s1 instead orbifold s1/z2. therefore, exponential mass hierarchy even second model. moreover, straightforward show even take account two 3-branes sign brane energy also exponential mass hierarchy suitable inequality holds like rst model. finally, let us consider mass scale branes z = l2i1. since equation u(l2i1) = 1, branes locations special feature. namely, attempt evaluate mass scale z = l2i1 mass scale z = l2j1 6= j, mass hierarchy, words, m(l2i1) = m(l2j1). however, artifact model. fact, modify value u(l2i1) one non-zero constant without violating validity einstein equation, situation exponential mass hierarcy before. summarize, investigated possibility constructing new model exponential mass hierarchy whose existence inspired perspective d-brane theory many universe cosmology. model, fth dimension topology s1 rather singular orbifold s1/z2, one advantages model. shown even present model, exponential mass hierarchy appropriate condition. however, many universes present model, perhaps universe many hidden universes, priori way determining universe universe among many universes. hence, correct interpretation results following: mass scale universe depends relative distance relation along fth dimension universe hidden universes. maybe god created many universes gave planck scale one (or some) universe(s) beginning big bang, mass scales various universes xed relative relation among universes. according new scenario, universe one exactly one low (or high) energy scale, world happens taken electro-weak scale low energy scale. although far presented two types solutions satisfy einstein equation simple manageable forms, also examined solutions detail . conclusion almost present cases, think two solutions account essential features theory. one disadvantage model well randall-sundrum original model {$9906064$} existence 3-branes negative potential energy. recently, alternative setup 7 put forward positive energy objects taken account {$9906064$}. wish investigate possibility generalizing model direction future. acknowledgement indebted m. tonin stimulating discussions continuous encouragement. wish thank dipartimento di fisica, galileo galilei, universita degli studi di padova, kind hospitality, parts work done.
