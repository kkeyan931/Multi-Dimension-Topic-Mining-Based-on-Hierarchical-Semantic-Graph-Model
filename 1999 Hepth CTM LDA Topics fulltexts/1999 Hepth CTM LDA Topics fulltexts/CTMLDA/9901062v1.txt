abstract

i briey describe a new class of soliton congurations in eld theories. these
consist of topological defects which can end when they intersect other de-
fects of equal or higher dimensionality. such congurations may be termed
dirichlet topological defects, in analogy with the d-branes of string theory.
i provide a specic example - cosmic strings that terminate on domain walls
- and discuss some new directions for this work, including an interesting and
qualitatively dierent extension to supersymmetric theories.

the study of topological soliton solutions to classical eld theories has led to many
important new ideas in particle physics and cosmology.
in particle physics, a common
feature of the recent progress in both supersymmetry (susy) and string theory has been
the discovery of dualities. these dualities map the calculationally dicult limit of one theory
into the (hopefully) calculationally easier limit of another theory. more precisely, dualities
often interchange the roles of the fundamental and solitonic degrees of freedom. for the case
of seiberg-witten dualities in susy eld theories, the relevant solitons are monopoles, so
that the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom are interchanged. for string theories, the
relevant objects are the d-branes; extended congurations on which fundamental strings can
end. in both cases, the study of solitons in the theories has led to a better understanding
of how particle physics works.

in cosmology, solitons, or defects, play two main roles. first, one may use cosmology
to constrain candidate particle physics theories. examples of this include the requirement
that symmetry breaking schemes not allow magnetic monopoles in the early universe, and
vorton constraints on theories admitting superconducting cosmic strings. second, the dy-
namics, interactions, and microphysics of topological defects can provide explanations for
cosmological problems. examples of this include the use of cosmic strings and textures as

seeds for the large scale structure, and the idea that topological solitons might play a role
in the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe.

topological defects are solitonic solutions whose stability is guaranteed by a topological
conservation law. when a symmetry group g is spontaneously broken to a subgroup h, the
types of defects supported depend on the homotopy properties of the vacuum manifold, m =
g/h. in a (d+1)-dimensional spacetime, p-dimensional defects (p < d) exist if the homotopy
group dp1(m) is nontrivial. (for reviews see [1].) in addition to these basic defects, there
are various composite solutions which combine two of the types, generally when a (p  1)-
dimensional defect serves as the boundary of a p-dimensional defect. such congurations
have interesting cosmological applications, such as in the langacker-pi mechanism for solving
the monopole problem [2].

in this brief review i will describe a new class of topological defects [6] which is comple-
mentary to those mentioned above. these consist of eld congurations in which one type
of topological defect can terminate when intersecting other defects of equal or higher di-
mensionality. such congurations may be termed dirichlet topological defects, in analogy
with the d-branes of string theory. the latter are extended objects on which fundamental
strings can end [7]. the models considered here are ordinary eld theories, which support
topological solitons which resemble these objects in fundamental string theory. here i will
only have space to provide the specic example of cosmic strings that terminate on domain
walls, and to comment on future directions for investigation.

strings arise most simply from the breakdown of u(1) symmetries. therefore consider
two complex elds i = ieii, (i = 1, 2), and a single real scalar , transforming under two
u(1) and one z2 symmetries in the following way

z2 :

{   , 1  2} ,

u(1)1 : 1  ei11 ,
u(1)2 : 2  ei22 .

(1)

the two u(1)s may be taken to be either global or gauge symmetries. in the latter case, 1
and 2 are functions of spacetime, and there are two gauge elds a(1)
 , with the usual
transformation properties, and associated covariant derivatives.

 , a(2)

write a general, renormalizable potential in the convenient form

v (, 1, 2) = (2 ev2)2 + h|1|2 + |2|2  ew2 + g(2 ev2)i2

+ h|1|2|2|2  (|1|2  |2|2) ,

where v = h||i is the root of the cubic equation

8v3 + 6gv2  (8ev2 + 2)v  2(gev2 + ew2) = 0

that reduces to ev at  = 0, and w is given by

w = ew2 + g(ev2  v2) +

v

2!1/2

.

in the vacuum the real scalar  takes the vev v and there may exist domain walls separating
these two values. when hi = +v, the vacuum has |1| = v and 2 = 0, while when hi = v
the vacuum has |2| = v and 1 = 0.

in this model, therefore, the unbroken symmetry group in the true vacuum is u(1), and
the vacuum manifold is m = [u(1)  u(1)  z2]/u(1) = s1  z2, admitting walls and
strings. when hi = +v, the complex eld 1 can form cosmic strings with winding number
n, around which 1 will change by 2n. such a string ends if it intersects a d-wall, since
h1i = 0 on the other side. analogous statements hold for the 2 eld when hi = v.

in the core of a string the corresponding u(1) symmetry is restored. in the gauge case,
therefore, the gauge bosons associated with, for example, u(1)1 are massless both in the core
of a 1-string on the hi = v side of the d-wall, and anywhere on the hi = v side of the
d-wall. as usual, outside the 1-string the gauge eld is pure gauge, such that it cancels the
gradient energy of the scalars by enforcing the vanishing of the covariant derivative. the
gauge eld is thus given by a(1)
 = 1. consequently, there is magnetic ux through
the string (which i take to have winding number n), given by (1) = n. this ux ows
through the string until it hits the wall; on the other side of the wall the symmetry is
unbroken everywhere, and the magnetic eld describes a monopole conguration emanating
from the point where the string intersects the wall.

congurations of the this type, with strings ending on walls, have recently been discussed
in the context of supersymmetric qcd [8]. there, the string consists of non-abelian ux,
and the wall separates dierent chiral vacua, with shifted values of the qcd -parameter.
the intersections of strings and domain walls can be thought of as quarks. the structures
of these qcd congurations and the scalar eld models discussed here are obviously very
similar, and the relationship between them deserves further investigation. (one dierence
is that the ux in the strings considered in [8] does not propagate freely on the other side
of the wall, as the symmetry is still broken there; rather, it is conned to the wall itself. it
should not be dicult to extend models of the type considered in this paper to include such
situations.)

i have described a class of topological defects in classical eld theories in (3+1) dimen-
sions, consisting of dirichlet defects on which fundamental defects of lower dimension can
terminate. while the search for models supporting these congurations is inspired by the
appearance of d-branes in string theory, there are important dierences between the two
sets of objects. in all of the theories considered, the basic degrees of freedom are scalar elds
and gauge elds, out of which all of the higher-dimensional objects are constructed. gravity
and supersymmetry are not included (although there are no obstacles to the appropriate
generalizations [9] ). furthermore, the specic dependence of d-brane energy on the string
coupling constant is not a feature of our models, and the ramond-ramond gauge elds
to which d-branes couple are absent. nevertheless, it may be interesting to compare the
dynamical behavior of dirichlet defects to that of d-branes in string theory, and search for
models in which the similarities between the two systems are even stronger.

one obvious direction in which to generalize the models considered here is to consider
q-dimensional defects ending on p-dimensional d-defects in d spatial dimensions. (there
are a variety of such objects in string theory and m-theory, with congurations governed by
charge conservation.) a number of interesting issues arise in this case, especially for gauge
symmetries. for example, to make topological defects of dimension q in d spatial dimensions
requires that dq1(m) be nontrivial, for example by breaking so(d  p) to so(d  p  1)
(for which m = sdp1). in such a model, the unbroken symmetry group so(d  p  1)
is non-abelian for p  d  4 and the low-energy gauge theory is expected to be strongly

coupled, and the resulting defects to be conned.

finally, as with any species of topological defect, it is also natural to ask what the
cosmological consequences of the formation of these objects in the early universe might be.
