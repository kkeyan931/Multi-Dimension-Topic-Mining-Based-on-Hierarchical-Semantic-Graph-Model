abstract

whenever the n = (2, 2) supersymmetry algebra of non-linear -models in two
dimensions does not close o-shell, a holomorphic two-form can be dened.
the only known superelds providing candidate auxiliary elds to achieve an
o-shell formulation are semi-chiral elds. such a semi-chiral description is
only possible when the two-form is constant. using an explicit example, hyper-
kahler manifolds, we show that this is not always the case. finally, we give a
concrete construction of semi-chiral potentials for a class of hyper-kahler man-
ifolds using the duality exchanging a pair consisting of a chiral and a twisted-
chiral supereld for one semi-chiral multiplet.

1. introduction

starting with zuminos discovery that the scalar elds of an n = 1 non-linear -

model in four dimensions should be viewed as coordinates on a kahler manifold [1],
ample evidence for the interplay between supersymmetry and complex geometry was
found.

requiring more supersymmetry or raising the dimension puts further restrictions
on the geometry, while lowering the dimensions relaxes the requirements. examples

of the former statement are well known in 4 dimensions where passing from n = 1
to n = 2 supersymmetry restricts the geometry of the scalars in vector multiplets

to so-called special kahler manifolds [2]. similarly, the scalars in hyper-multiplets
describe special hyper-kahler manifolds [3].

particularly interesting examples of supersymmetric models in lower dimensions

are two-dimensional non-linear -models which are used e.g.
for the world-sheet
description of stringtheory. the closest analog in two dimensions of n = 1 super-

symmetry in four dimensions is n = (2, 2) supersymmetry. as long as torsion is
absent, the target manifold is indeed kahler [4] and an o-shell description is known.

however, once torsion is present, the geometry becomes much richer [5], [6] and an
o-shell description is much harder to achieve. finding an o-shell description has

been the subject of numerous studies, [5], [7], [8], [9] and [10], which culminated in
[11]. there strong evidence was put forward to support the conjecture that chiral,
twisted-chiral and semi-chiral superelds are sucient to give a manifest o-shell

description of these models. these are the only superelds which can be dened by
constraints on a general n = (2, 2) supereld which are linear in the fermionic deriva-

tives. several explicit examples are known. all kahler-manifolds can be described by
chiral superelds, the su(2)  u(1) wess-zumino-witten model is described either
by a chiral and a twisted-chiral eld [8] or by a semi-chiral multiplet [11]. finally, the
su(2)  su(2) wess-zumino-witten model requires one semi-chiral and one chiral
multiplet [11]. various models dual to the above mentioned models were constructed
in [9], [8], [12].

in the present paper we focus on the case where the n = (2, 2) does not close o-

shell in all directions and investigate under which conditions semi-chiral superelds
provide an o-shell formulation. non-closure implies the existence of a holomorphic

two-form. a necessary condition for the semi-chiral description to be possible is that
there exists a complex coordinate system in which this two-form is constant. using

a particular example, hyper-kahler manifolds, we are able to show that semi-chiral
elds alone are not able to give a full o-shell description thus falsifying the conjecture
given in [11]. semi-chiral potentials do describe hyper-kahler manifolds provided the

potential satises a non-linear dierential equation.

2

we end the paper with a short study of duality transformations involving semi-

chiral elds. an interesting duality brings a model described by one chiral and one
twisted-chiral supereld to a model formulated in terms of one semi-chiral multiplet

[12], [9]. if the original model has an n = (4, 4) supersymmetry, which is true when
the potential satises the laplace equation [5], then the dual model is a hyper-kahler

manifold. in this way we generate a class of solutions to the non-linear dierential
equation using solutions of a linear dierential equation. this construction is similar
in spirit to the construction in [13], where hyper-kahler potentials were constructed

using the duality between a real linear and a chiral supereld.

2. n = (2, 2) supersymmetric non-linear -models

a bosonic non-linear -model in two dimensions is characterized by a manifold, the
target manifold, endowed with a metric g and a closed 3-form t. locally, the
torsion can be written as the exterior derivative of the torsion potential b,

t =

(2.1)

such a model can be promoted to an n = (1, 1) supersymmetric model without
any additional conditions on the geometry. however, passing from n = (1, 1) to
+ and j 
n = (2, 2) supersymmetry requires further structure. two (1,1) tensors j 

are needed which satisfy

where + and  denote covariant dierentiation1 using the

 connections resp. the rst two conditions arise from requiring
that the supersymmetry algebra is satised on-shell and the last two conditions follow
from the invariance of the action. eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) imply that both j+ and j are
complex structures. eq. (2.4) imposes hermiticity of the metric with respect to both

 and

complex structures and eq. (2.5) states that both complex structures are covariantly
constant but, when torsion is present, with respect to dierent connections.

the n = (2, 2) models characterized by eqs. (2.2-2.5) realize the n = (2, 2) su-

persymmetry algebra on-shell only. one can show that the o-shell non-closing terms
in the algebra, are proportional to the commutator of the two complex structures,
[j+, j] [11]. the construction of a manifest o-shell supersymmetric version of these

model was the subject of intense investigations [5], [7], [8], [9], [11]. locally, the

cotangent space can be decomposed as

ker[j+, j]  (ker[j+, j]) = ker(j+  j)  ker(j+ + j)  (ker[j+, j]). (2.6)
in [9], it was shown that ker(j+  j) and ker(j+ + j) are integrable to chiral
and twisted-chiral superelds resp. these superelds count as many components as
n = (1, 1) superelds. indeed, as the algebra closes o-shell in these directions, one
does not expect that any new auxiliary elds are needed.

chiral and twisted chiral superelds separately describe kahler manifolds. how-
ever when both of them are simultanously present, the resulting manifold exhibits a

product structure which projects on two kahler subspaces [5]. the complete manifold
is not kahler, which can be seen from the fact that it has torsion.

in [11], it was shown that the dimension of (ker[j+, j]) is a multiple of four
(see also further in this section). furthermore, o-shell closure of the algebra requires
additional auxiliary elds compared to the manifestly n = (1, 1) formulation of the

model. only one class of superelds dened by constraints linear in the derivatives
satises these requirements: the semi-chiral superelds[7]. this, combined with sev-

eral non-trivial examples, led to the conjecture [11] that semi-chiral superelds are
sucient to describe (ker[j+, j]).
in the present paper, we will give a class of
explicit examples disproving the conjecture.

from now on we focus our attention on the case where ker[j+, j] = . denoting
c  [j+, j], we construct a non-degenerate two-form (u, v )  g(u,c1v ) or in
local coordinates

(2.7)

(2.8)

 = g(c1)

.

the inverse of the commutator c1 can be written as the formal power series

(jj+)2n+1 = xn0
the two-form satises (ju, jv ) = (u, v ).

c1 = xn0

(j+j)2n+1.

introducing complex coordinates z and z  = (z), we diagonalize j+: j 

+ = i
and j 
+  = 0. in complex coordinates, only  and its complex conjugate are non-
vanishing. eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) for j+ imply that t = 0 and g = 0 resp. finally
eq. (2.5) for j+ yields + =  = 0. combining this with eq. (2.5) for j gives



 = 0.

(2.9)

finally, let us give a very short proof that ker[j+, j] =  implies that d = 4n
with n  n. we view  as the components of an anti-symmetric d/2 d/2 matrix.

4

from ker[j+, j] =  combined with the non-degeneracy of the metric, we get that
its determinant is non-vanishing implying that d/2 should be even.

3. semi-chiral parametrization

we denote the semi-chiral coordinates by ra, ra, sa and sa, a, a, a, a  {1,   n}, and
we introduce a real function k(r, r, s, s), the semi-chiral potential. it is determined
modulo the transformation k  k + f (r) + f (r) + g(s) + g(s) with f (r) and g(s)
arbitrary holomorphic functions of r and s resp. the potential is the lagrange density

in n = (2, 2) superspace. passing to n = (1, 1) superspace and eliminating the
auxiliary elds through their equations of motion yields explicit expressions for the

metric, torsion potential and the complex structures [11].

in order to facilitate the notation, we introduce the 2n  2n matrices l, n, m,
cn and cm .

eq. (3.5) clearly shows that the vanishing of ker[j+, j] is necessary and sucient
for the existence of a non-degenerate metric. furthermore, the potential should be

(3.7)

rows and columns are labeled as z, z, w and w. note that there is also a simple
coordinate transformation which diagonalizes j which is obtained by reversing the
roles of r and s in the previous expressions.

eq. (3.10) now gives the two-form  in complex coordinates,

b =

a

2

a.

(3.11)

so we reach the conclusion that a necessary condition for a semi-chiral parametriza-

tion to be possible is the existence of a complex coordinate system in which the two-

form  is constant! note that for d = 4, we can always nd a holomorphic coordinate

transformation which makes the two-form  constant. for d > 4 this is not the case
anymore.

finally, for the sake of completeness, let us mention that these models are 1-
loop uv nite provided they are ricci at where the ricci tensor is computed using

the connection with torsion. in [16] the one-loop -function was directly computed
in n = (2, 2) superspace. its vanishing yields a constraint on the potential which

requires the existence of a holomorphic function of r, f (r) and a holomorphic function
of s, g(s), such that

(3.13)

4. hyper-kahler manifolds

as is clear from eq. (3.5), the semi-chiral parametrization is well dened, provided
ker[j+, j] = . the most familiar class of complex manifolds satisfying this are the
hyper-kahler manifolds. a hyper-kahler manifold has three complex structures ji,
i  {1, 2, 3} which satisfy

jijj = ij1 + ijkjk,

(4.1)

and which are such that the manifold is kahler with respect to all three of them.

it is easy to see that a hyper-kahler manifold has a two-sphere worth of complex
structures. indeed ~x  ~j = p3
i=1 xiji is a complex structure provided that ~x  ~x = 1.
choosing e.g. j+ = j1, and requiring that ker[j+, j] = , we nd that j can be
any element of the two-sphere, except for the north- and southpole, ~x = (1, 0, 0).
choosing for j the north-pole, we obtain the description of the manifold in terms
of chiral superelds, while choosing the south-pole we get the parametrization in
terms of twisted-chiral superelds. clearly, these are the only two choices where
j+ and j commute.
in other words, there is a cylinder worth of choices for j
where the algebra does not close o-shell and which can potentially be described

by semi-chiral coordinates.
in order for this to work, we need at least that the
torsion vanishes, t = 0. indeed, choosing one element of the cylinder j = ~x  ~j,
we get {j+, j} = 2x11. from eq. (3.6), one obtains that for a generic element
of the cylinder, the torsion potential diers from zero, but the torsion still vanishes,

t = db = 0. turning to the two-form  introduced in section 2, one easily shows
that, for the present choice for j+ = j1 and j = ~x  ~j, it is given by

 =

(x32  x23),

(4.2)

2 + x2
3)

2(x2

where i are the fundamental two-forms of the hyper-kahler manifold, dened by
i(u, v )  g(u, jiv ), i  {1, 2, 3}. as was shown in the previous section, a semi-
chiral parametrization is only possible, if complex coordinates exist, diagonalizing
j+, where  is constant. in this case  is given as a linear combination of the the
two fundamental two-forms 2 and 3. several explicit examples are known of higher
dimensional hyper-kahler manifolds where this is not the case [13].

as was already mentioned, there is still the simplest case d = 4, where both 2 and
3 can be made constant through a holomorphic coordinate transformation. however

7

we nd, as we will see in next section, that the metric satises the monge-ampere

equation after passing from semi-chiral to complex coordinates. to achieve this on a
hyper-kahler manifold, one already needs a holomorphic coordinate transformation.

the residual holomorphic coordinate transformations can now only turn the two-form
to a constant provided the two-form was originally a phase, which as far as we know,

is not necessarily true. nonetheless, many interesting examples are of this kind. in
particular, the four dimensional hyper-kahler manifolds constructed in [13] are of
this form. this includes familiar examples such as the multi-eguchi-hanson [14] and

taub-nut [15] self-dual instantons.

5. the four-dimensional case

the simplest hyper-kahler manifolds are the four dimensional ones. we will choose
j+ = j1 and j = j2. requiring {j+, j} = 0 we nd using eq. (3.4) that the
semi-chiral potential should satisfy

|krs|2 + |krs|2 = 2krrkss.

(5.1)

performing the coordinate transformation eq. (3.8), we nd that the metric eq. (3.10)
satises the monge-amp`ere equation,

g

z zg

w w  g

z wg

wz = 1,

(5.2)

i. eq. (5.1) holds. indeed, in four dimensions one nds that eq. (3.5) yields the
following non-vanishing components of the metric (and their complex conjugates),

grr = 41krrkrskrs, grr = 21krr(cid:16)|krs|2 + |krs|2(cid:17) ,
grs = 21krs(cid:16)krrkss + |krs|2(cid:17) , grs = 21krs(cid:16)krrkss + |krs|2(cid:17) ,
gss = 41ksskrskrs, gss = 21kss(cid:16)|krs|2 + |krs|2(cid:17) ,

(5.3)

where   |krs|2  |krs|2. after the coordinate transformation eq. (3.8), the com-
ponents of the metric are given by

g

z z = g1

g

w w = 21kss, g

z w = 21 (krskrs  krrkss) ,
w w(cid:16)|gz w|2 + 1(cid:17)  (2kss)1 (|krs|2 + |krs|2  2krrkss)2.

(5.4)

as a result we get that eq. (5.1) is indeed a necessary and sucient condition on the
potential so that it describes a hyper-kahler potential. note that, as expected, eq.
(3.12) is satised with f (r) = g(s) = 1.

in [13], a powerful method was developed to construct solutions to eq.

(5.2),
the legendre transformation construction. in the remainder of this section we will

discuss various duality transformations which involve semi-chiral elds and we will

8

give a construction of solutions to eq.

(5.1) analogous to the legendre transform

construction in [13].

in [12] (see also [9]) various duality transformations in n = (2, 2) superspace were

catalogued. the simplest ones are those which do not need any isometries. they
arise by passing to a rst order action in superspace. i.e. the supereld constraints

are imposed through lagrange multipliers. the best known example is the duality
between chiral and complex linear superelds (for a recent account see e.g.
[17]).
both describe kahler geometry and the former gives the minimal description while

the latter is a non-minimal description. the two potentials are related through a
simple legendre transformation.

similar duality transformations exist for semi-chiral superelds. one can perform
a legendre transformation either with respect to r or with respect to s or with respect

to both of them. given a potential k(r, r, s, s), we can construct three potentials

k1(r, r, s, s) = k(r, r, s, s)  rr  rr,
k2(r, r, s, s) = k(r, r, s, s)  ss  ss,
k3(r, r, s, s) = k(r, r, s, s)  rr  rr  ss  ss,

(5.5)

where in the rst case r = kr, in the second case s = ks and in the last case
r = kr and s = ks hold. one veries immediately that if k satises eq. (5.1) then
so do k1, k2 and k3. these three duality transformations simply shue around the
auxiliary eld content of the system and act as mere coordinate transformations on
the physical elds.

in case isometries are present more interesting duality transformations become
possible. the most typical semi-chiral example is the one which interchanges one

semi-chiral multiplet for one chiral and one twisted chiral multiplet. the geome-
try obviously changes now. in the present case the semi-chiral coordinates describe
a hyper-kahler manifold, while the chiral/twisted chiral combination describes a

manifold with a product structure which has e.g. a non-trivial torsion. at the
chiral/twisted-chiral side the model shows a simple enhancement of the supersym-

metry to n = (4, 4), provided the potential satises the laplace equation. the dual
potential turns out to describe a hyper-kahler manifold. by this construction, one

obtains immediately the semi-chiral parametrization of the hyper-kahler manifold.
the advantage of this construction is that the non-linear dierential equation (5.1)

gets replaced by a linear dierential equation, the laplace equation.

the starting point is a real prepotential f (x, u, u), where x  r and u  c, which

satises the laplace equation

fxx + fuu = 0.

(5.6)

9

this combines two requirements: the chiral/twisted-chiral potential, which is precisely

the prepotential under consideration, simultanously exihibits an abelian isometry and
it has n = (4, 4) supersymmetry. full details can be found in the appendix. the

present coordinates x and u are related to the chiral and twisted-chiral coordinates z
and w by x = i(z  z + w  w), u = z + w and u = u.

the semi-chiral potential k(r  r, r + s, r + s) is obtained from the prepotential

through a legendre transformation,

k(r  r, r + s, r + s) = f (x, u, u)

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

using this, one immediately checks that the resulting semi-chiral potential satises
eq. (5.1). in other words, dualizing a chiral/twisted-chiral potential having an n =

(4, 4) supersymmetry and an abelian isometry yields a semi-chiral potential which
describes a hyper-kahler manifold! the resulting potential obviously still has an
abelian isometry, r =  and s =  with   r.

this construction is strikingly similar to the legendre transform construction in
[13], which follows from the duality between an n = (4, 4) model described by a

real linear and a chiral supereld and an n = (4, 4) model described by two chiral
superelds. again this duality requires an abelian isometry. there too, eq. (5.6)

was the starting point for the construction of hyper-kahler potentials directly in local

10

complex coordinates. from a real prepotential f (x, v, v), satisfying fxx + fvv = 0,
one obtains the kahler potential, kkahler, through the legendre transformation

kkahler(v, v, z, z) = f (x, v, v)  (z + z)x,

where

fx = z + z.

this allows for explicit expressions for the metric in terms of the prepotential,

 and g

vv follows from the monge-amp`ere equation. the extra fun-

comparing both constructions is possible if we pass from semi-chiral to complex
coordinates. for simplicity, we use the coordinate transformation which diagonalizes
j,

r  w = ks,

s  z = s,

(5.14)

and from eq. (5.7), one gets the identication w = u. the metric is then given by
eq. (5.4) in which r and s are interchanged. combining this with eq. (5.9) yields the

expression for the metric in complex coordinates,

g
z z = i(fxu  fxu)1, g

z w = i(fuu + fxx)(fxu  fxu)1,

(5.15)

where once more we obtain g
w w from the monge-amp`ere equation. comparing eq.
(5.13) to eq. (5.15) we get, after identifying u = iv, a relation between f (x, v, v)
and f (x, v, v),

fx = fv + fv + ,

(5.16)

with  a real constant. given either f or f , this allows the construction of f and f
resp. the requirement that the resulting prepotential satises the laplace equation
fully determines the prepotential f , once f is given. however, given f , f is only
determined modulo a function g(v v, x) which satises gv + gv = 0 and gxx = gvv.
this has no inuence on both eqs. (5.16) and (5.6) but it might be needed in order
to have a well-dened legendre transformation in eq.
(5.8) which is equivalent to
requiring that  in eq. (5.10) does not vanish.

we give a few examples where each time both the complex and the semi-chiral
prepotential are given. each time it is straightforward to check that both satisfy the

laplace equation and that they are related by eq. (5.16).

other prepotentials for hyper-kahler manifolds can now be constructed by super-
imposing f1 and f2 or equivalently f1 and f2. in this way one obtains the multi-
eguchi-hanson manifolds [14, 15, 13] by superimposing f2 or f2 about dierent points
~a,

feh =

or the taub-nut manifolds [15, 13] by adding an f1 to this

6. conclusions

in [11], it was conjectured that chiral, twisted-chiral and semi-chiral superelds are

sucient to give a full o-shell, manifest supersymmetric description of n = (2, 2)
supersymmetric non-linear -models in two dimensions. the chiral and twisted-chiral
superelds do give a complete description of the directions along which the super-

symmetry closes [9] while the semi-chiral superelds were expected to introduce the
necessary auxiliary elds for those directions where no o-shell closure was achieved.

in the present paper we showed that this is not true. non-closure of the n = (2, 2)
supersymmetry implies the existence of a holomorphic two-form. moving from semi-

chiral coordinates to complex coordinates, one gets that this two-form is constant.
hyper-kahler manifolds provide particularly interesting examples. choosing left-
and right-complex structures to be anti-commuting, we do get full non-closure of the

algebra. the above mentioned two-form is the fundamental two-form associated with
the third complex structure which is the product of the left with the right complex

structure. a necessary condition for the semi-chiral parametrization to be possible is
that this fundamental two-form is a constant, which is not the case for an arbitrary

hyper-kahler manifold!

as a result, the problem of nding a manifest supersymmetric description of

n = (2, 2) non-linear -models is once more open. chiral, twisted-chiral and semi-
chiral superelds exhaust the superelds which can be dened by constraints linear
in the superderivatives. what remains are constraints which are higher order in

the derivatives. these have not been systematically studied, but past experience
shows that most often they give non-minimal descriptions of known super-multiplets.

finally, there is a last possibility which would certainly work but which involves har-
monic superspace. a drawback of this approach is that it is extremely hard to extract

explicit expressions for metric and torsion.

finally, we presented a systematic way to construct d = 4 hyper-kahler manifolds

starting from an intriguing duality transformation between an n = (4, 4) model
described by one chiral and one twisted chiral supereld and a d = 4 hyper-kahler
manifold. in particular, this implies that well-known hyper-kahler manifolds such as

multi-eguchi-hanson and taub-nut have a dual which is a complex manifold with a
product structure. the consequences of this duality transformation and the relation,

if any, with the non-abelian t-duals of these models given in [18], certainly merit
further study.

appendix: n = (2, 2) superspace

in this appendix we summarize some properties of n = (2, 2) superspace and super-
elds, together with some aspects of duality transformations. the fermionic coordi-
nates which parametrize the n = (2, 2) superspace are denoted by +,  +  (+),
 and    () and the bosonic coordinates by x=| and x=. the fermionic
derivatives d+, d +  (d+), d and d   (d) satisfy

{d+, d +} = 2i=|,

{d, d } = 2i=,

(a.1)

with all other (anti-)commutators between derivatives vanishing. the n = (1, 1)
superderivatives are given by the real part of the n = (2, 2) fermionic derivatives,

(a.3)

consider a set of general n = (2, 2) superelds, x ,   {1,   , d}. the most

general constraints linear in the derivatives are

q+x  = j 

+(x) d+x ,

qx  = j 

(x) dx .

(a.4)

a detailed analysis of the integrability conditions following from eq. (a.4) yields that
both j+ and j are complex structures which mutually commute [11]. through a
suitable coordinate transformation they can be diagonalized resulting in two classes

of superelds, chiral and twisted-chiral [5] superelds.

 chiral superelds, z and z  z,

d +z = d z = 0 or q+z = +i d+z and qz = +i dz.

 twisted chiral superelds, w and w  w,
d +w = dw = 0 or q+w = +i d+w and qw = i dw.

on a chiral supereld dz, both j+ and j have eigenvalue +i. on a twisted chiral
supereld dw , one nds that j+ has eigenvalue +i while j has eigenvalue i. chiral

and twisted chiral elds have the same number of components as a general n = (1, 1)

supereld, consistent with the fact that the algebra closes in the directions where the
complex structures commute. a weaker set of constraints is still possible where only

one chirality gets constrained. a detailed analysis shows that, in order to get non-
trivial dynamics, they should occur in pairs, the members of which have constraints

of opposite chirality. this results in semi-chiral superelds [7].

 semi-chiral superelds, r, r  r, s and s  s,

d +r = ds = 0 or q+r = +i d+r and qs = i ds.

semi-chiral superelds contain twice as many components as an n = (1, 1) supereld,
however, half of them turn out to be auxiliary. on dr, j+ is diagonal with eigenvalue
+i, while on ds, j is diagonal with eigenvalue +i. the precise action of j on dr
and j+ on ds is model dependent and can only be obained after elimination of the
auxiliary elds.

other constraints, linear in the derivatives, are still possible, but they imply re-
strictions on the dependence of the superelds on the bosonic coordinates (see e.g.

[19]). we do not consider this here as it does not seem relevant to the present case.
finally, we comment on duality transformations involving semi-chiral superelds.

it is well known that in the presence of an abelian isometry a chiral eld can be
dualized to a twisted-chiral supereld and vice-versa. similarly [9, 11], when a specic

abelian isometry is present, a pair consisting of a chiral and a twisted-chiral supereld
can be dualized to a semi-chiral eld and vice-versa. consider a model described by
a chiral/twisted chiral potential f (z, z, w, w), which is such that an abelian isometry

exists,

z = ,

w = ,

(a.5)

with  a real constant. we introduce prepotentials v and w which are complex
unconstrained superelds and one set of semi-chiral superelds r and s. we consider

the rst order action

s = z d2xd4f (w  w , v + w , v + w )

r(v + w )  r( v + w )  s( v + w )  s(v + w ).

(a.6)

if we rst integrate over the semi-chiral elds, we recover the original model in terms
of a chiral and a twisted-chiral eld. indeed, the equations of motion for r and s,

d +(v + w ) = d+( v + w ) = d( v + w ) = d (v + w ),

(a.7)

imply that

d +d(v  v ) = d+d (v  v ) = d +d (w  w ) = d+d(w  w ) = 0, (a.8)

15

which are solved by putting v = z and w = w. the dual model is obtained by rst

integrating over the pre-potentials which yields

fv = r + s,

fw = r + s,

(a.9)

which can be solved for the prepotentials v (r, r, s, s) and w (r, r, s, s). the semichiral
potential, k(r  r, r + s, r + s), is simply the legendre transform of f ,

k(r  r, r + s, r + s) = f (w  w , v + w , v + w )

(w  w )(r  r)  (v + w )(r + s)  ( v + w )(r + s).

(a.10)

in [5] it was shown that a system with one chiral and one twisted-chiral supereld

allows for a full n = (4, 4) supersymmetry,

z =  +d + w +  d w,
w =  +d + z  dz,
z = +d+w + d w,
 w = +d+z   d  z,

provided the potential f (z, z, w, w), satises the laplace equation,

fz z + fw w = 0.
