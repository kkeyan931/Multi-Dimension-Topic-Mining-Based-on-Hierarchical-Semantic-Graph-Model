abstract

a general calculation of casimir energies in an arbitrary number of dimensions for
massless quantized elds in spherically symmetric cavities is carried out. all the most com-
mon situations, including scalar and spinor elds, the electromagnetic eld, and various
boundary conditions are treated with care. the nal results are given as analytical (closed)
expressions in terms of barnes zeta functions. a direct, straightforward numerical evalua-
tion of the formulas is then performed, which yields highly accurate numbers of, in principle,
arbitrarily good precision.

introduction

calculations of casimir energies in spherically symmetric situations have attracted the interest
of physicists for well over thirty years now. since the calculation of boyer [1], who computed
the casimir energy for a conducting spherical shell and found an attractive force, many dierent
situations in the spherically symmetric context have been considered. for example, dielectrics
were included [2] (for the case of plane, parallel surfaces see [3]) and used later on for possible
explanations of sonoluminescence [4] [8]. moreover, enormous interest has been attracted by
the mit bag model in qcd [9] [20] and, also, the inuence of dierent boundary conditions
has been considered in detail [21, 22, 23].

dierent methods have been used for dealing with the casimir eect. whereas in the earlier
times mostly the green function formalism was employed, in recent years dierent approaches
which make use of contour integral representations of the involved spectral sums are com-
monplace. although the idea for this method, in the specic context of casimir energies, goes
back to the early days of the subject [24], a systematic, eective and simple application of this
approach in various contexts has only recently been achieved [21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29].

the spectral sum which actually appears in the calculation depends on the regularization
used and may include a cuto function, to dampen high frequency contributions [29] or, as in
the zeta regularization technique [28], complex powers of the eigenvalues [21, 22, 26, 30]. as a
result, the details of the computation may dier slightly, e.g., in the specic integration contour
chosen, but all of them share the elegance of this method.

in recent contributions we have further developed the zeta function technique, in combination
with several contour integral representations. given the deep connections among zeta functions,
heat kernels and functional determinants [31] [34], one advantage of the method is that it can be
applied, alternatively, to the calculation of heat kernel coecients [26], functional determinants
[27, 30] (see also [35, 36]), as well as casimir energies [20] [22]. this clearly shows that zeta
functions serve as a unied framework in dierent areas of interest.

here we want to pursue this idea, by using the zeta function framework in a precise analysis
of the casimir energy as a function of the dimension of space. previously it had been shown,
that arbitrary space dimension can be treated elegantly by making use of barnes zeta functions,
where the dimension can be considered as a parameter [27, 37]. this has been applied to
the calculation of heat-kernel coecients and determinants and it will be here used to study
the casimir energy. apart from dealing with arbitrary dimensions, we will introduce scalars,
spinor elds and the electromagnetic eld in a unied way, including the eects dierent sets
of boundary conditions have on them. in spirit, our analysis is to be compared with the one of
ambjrn and wolfram in ref. [38], with the dierence that the role of the epstein zeta function
there is here overtaken by the barnes zeta function. for a recent analysis on the dimensional
dependence of the casimir energy for scalar elds with dirichlet boundary conditions and the
electromagnetic eld in the presence of a spherical shell see [39, 40]. in these papers, the space
dimension d has been dealt with as a parameter too and results for (in principle) all values of
real d have been obtained.

the article is organized as follows.

in the next section we briey give the denition of
casimir energies in terms of zeta functions. afterwards, in sect. 3, we shortly describe the
method presented in [27] and derive the formulas that are subsequently needed in the context
of casimir energy calculations. in sect. 4 we consider the scalar eld. for dirichlet boundary
conditions, the energy in dimensions d = 2 up to d = 9 will be given. the interior and the
exterior regions are treated separately. afterwards, the changes in the procedure needed for
robin boundary conditions are explained, and the corresponding formulas applied. given that
the casimir energy of the electromagnetic eld is determined by the casimir energy of a scalar
eld satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions (te modes) and a scalar eld satisfying robin

2

boundary conditions (tm modes), such forms constitute already the basis for this case, as later
described in sect. 6 in detail. section 5 is devoted to the spinor eld. local bag boundary
conditions, as well as global spectral boundary conditions, are considered. in the conclusions,
sect. 7, our main results will be summarized.

2 the casimir energy

the casimir energy of a quantum eld (t, ~x) inside a spherical shell is formally given by

ecas =

k,

1

2xk

with the one-particle energies k = k being dened as
 k(~x) = kk(~x),

(2.1)

(2.2)

together with suitable boundary conditions. in our case, the eld operator is a = 2
t   and
we have (t, ~x) = eit(~x). the laplacian  is dened inside or outside the d = (d + 1)-
dimensional ball bd = {~x  ird| |~x|  r} and the elds (~x) must satisfy appropriate boundary
conditions at k~xk = r.
the casimir energy as given by the formal expression (2.1) is ill dened and has to be
regularised. in the -function regularisation, one writes

ecas =

1
2

2s(s  1/2)|s=0 ,

(s) = xk6=0

s
k

.

(2.3)

(2.4)

here,  is an arbitrary parameter with dimensions of mass to give the correct dimension for all
values of s and (s) is the -function related to the operator a. in some cases, ecas will be
divergent and, as is known and will be seen later on, renormalization ambiguities may remain.
in order to calculate ecas according to the previous denition, we need information on the
zeta function (s) about s = 1/2. since we are dealing with operators in at space, but
satisfying boundary conditions on a d-dimensional sphere (the boundary of the d-dimensional
ball), the eigenvalues will be implicitly given as the zeros of a polynomial p ( z, z 
 ) involving
bessel or hankel functions, according to whether one is considering the internal or the external
solutions, respectively. we will denote the associated zeta functions by  int(s) and  ext(s). the
total casimir energy will be the sum of the two terms, that is

ecas =

1
2

2sh int(s  1/2) +  ext(s  1/2)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0

.

(2.5)

with few modications, all considerations above can be extended to the dirac operator. as a
result, the relevant construct is the zeta function of the square of the dirac operator and one
nds a minus sign in (2.3).

3 the method

the method we are using here has been developed in [26, 27] and permits to compute the -
function starting from the (indirect) knowledge of the eigenvalues through an implicit relation
of the kind

p ( zl(nlr), z 

l(nlr)) = 0 ,

nl = 2

nl ,

(3.1)

3

where n, l  0 are the principal and azimuthal quantum numbers respectively. the degeneracy
d(l) of the eigenvalues and the index l of the bessel functions depend on l and on the dimension.
their explicit forms are strictly related to the elds and the boundary conditions.

now, the -function can be expressed as an integral in the complex plane, that is

(s) =xl

d(l)

2i z

k2s 
k

ln kbl p ( zl(k), z 

l(k)) dk ,

re s >

d
2

,

(3.2)

where the open contour  has to be chosen to run counterclockwise and to enclose all strictly
positive solutions of eq. (3.1). the additional factor kbl has been inserted in order to cancel
the pole at the origin, which is important when deforming the contour in the next step.
in
this way  can also include the origin. here b is a number which depends on the asymptotic
behaviour of p at the origin: in our cases it will be 1 for scalars, but for spin 1/2 with mixed
boundary conditions it turns out to be 2.
for explicit calculation, it is convenient to write eq. (3.2) as an integral on the real axis. this
can be done by deforming the contour  to the imaginary axis and by making the substitution
k  iy. in general one has to be careful when deforming the contour in that no poles in the
plane re k  0 are hit. in fact, for robin boundary conditions one has

 ) =  z(k) + k z 

(3.3)
which may have solutions for k / ir too, if  > . to avoid these cases, in the following we
shall consider   0 only, 0 corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue.

 (k) = (  ) z(k) + k z1(k) = 0 ,

with this assumption we can write the -function in the more simple form

p ( z, z 

(s) =

sin s



xl=0

d(l)z 

0

y2s 
y

ln[yblp (l, y)] dy ,

(3.4)

which is valid for 1/2 < re s < 1 (for details see [26]). here, p (, y) = p (z (y), z 
 (y)) is a
polynomial like p (aside, possibly, from an irrelevant sign) and z(y) = z(iy) are the modied
bessel functions corresponding to z.
in order to compute the casimir energy we need the
-function at s = 1/2 and so we have to do an analytic continuation of eq. (3.4).
for large values of , we have [45]

to this aim, let us now employ the asymptotic expansion of the modied bessel functions.

as we shall see explicitly in the following, the above behaviour of bessel functions permits

us to write

ln p (, z)  ln f (, z) +

nxn=1

dn(t)

n

,

(3.12)

an expression which is valid for large values of . the function f is related to the exponential
factors in eqs. (3.5)-(3.8), while the coecients dn(t) are related to k and are polynomials in
t. more precisely

dn(t) =

2nxk=0

xnktn+k .

(3.13)

note that when b = 1, all xnk with odd k vanish. of course, f , dn and xnk depend on the
specic problem under consideration. we will specify them for every case.
now, the trick consists in subtracting the asymptotic behaviour from the integrand function

and exactly integrating the asymptotic part with arbitrary s. we thus get

(s) = z0(s) + z(s) +

nxn=1

an(s).

(3.18)

(3.19)

eq. (3.16) is convergent for (d  2  n )/2 < re s < 1, thus for our aim it is sucient to
subtract n = d asymptotic terms. this means that with n = d we can directly put z = 1/2
in eq. (3.16) and perform the integral numerically.

5

as we shall see in the explicit examples, the base -function, n , can be conveniently ex-

pressed in terms of the barnes zeta function [42], dened as [43]

b(s, a; d) =

en(d) =

x~m=0

1

(a + m1 + ... + md)s =

(d + n  1)!
n!(d  1)!

,

en(d)(a + n)s ,

xn=0

for re s > d. obviously, there is an expansion of the kind

en(d) =

d1x=0

g(d)(a + n)

and this yields the expansion of the barnes zeta function in terms of the hurwitz zeta function
[43]

b(s, a; d) =

d1x=0

g(d)h (s  , a).

(3.20)

for example, for d = 2, we trivially get

b(s, a; 2) = h(s  1, a) + (1  a)h(s, a).

one can show that the g(d) are connected with the generalised bernoulli polynomials [46]. this
allows, in a direct way, to determine the residues and nite parts of the barnes zeta function of
the problem at hand. as a result, the asymptotic contributions in (3.14) are readily computed.

4 the scalar eld

the eld equation for this case reads

 k(~x) = kk(~x),

(4.1)

and has to be supplemented with dirichlet or robin boundary conditions. here,  is the
laplace operator inside or outside the d = (d + 1)-dimensional ball and we impose dirichlet
((~x)||~x|=r = 0) or robin ([(~x)| + (~x)]||~x|=r = 0) boundary conditions.

in polar coordinates the solutions read

l,m,n(r, ) = r1d/2f(l,nr)yl+d/2()

with l = l + (d  2)/2, the f(r) being bessel functions and the yl+d/2() hyperspherical
harmonics [41].

4.1 scalar eld with dirichlet boundary conditions inside a spherical shell

in this case, the f are bessel functions of the rst kind and thus the eigenvalues l,n = 2
dened through

l,n are

j(l,nr) = 0

and have degeneracies d(l) = (2l + d  1) (l+d2)!

[42, 27]

l!(d1)! . from the last equation it easily follows that

n = b(cid:18)2s,

d + 1

2

; d(cid:19) + b(cid:18)2s,

d  1

2

; d(cid:19) .

(4.2)

in this case, we have

p ( z(k), z 

 (k)) = j (k) ,

p (, z) = i(z),

and, as a consequence,

f (, z) =

the asymptotic contributions have been calculated to be [27]

a0(s) =

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

the -function for the present situation is obtained by means of eqs. (3.13)-(3.17) with the
denitions above.

as already advanced in the previous section, in two dimension we have an aditional contri-

bution that has to be computed explicitly. with this aim, we recall that, for large z,

i0(z) =

ez

2z(cid:26)1 +

8z

+ o(cid:16)z2(cid:17)(cid:27)

where the poles at s = 1/2 are shown explicitly. the integrals are now convergent for s = 1/2
and can be computed numerically.

4.2 scalar eld with dirichlet boundary conditions outside a spherical shell

now the radial part of the solutions are bessel functions of the third kind (hankel functions),
while l and d(l) remain the same. thus, we have

owing to the particular relation between 1 and 3, the coecients dn(t) dier from the
corresponding coecients one has in the internal case just for the trivial factor (1)n. the
same holds also for the quantities an(s).
in two dimensions we have to consider also the contribution due to  = 0, which can be

obtained along the same lines as in the previous case, eq. (4.7). the result is

the numerical results corresponding to the -functions inside and outside the shell and the total
casimir energy are reported in table 1 for the choices d = 2, ..., 9. for the interior space for
d = 2 and d = 3 as well as for d = 3 and the exterior space, our results agree with [22]. for
the whole space in d = 3 the result is given in [23, 39].

4.3 scalar eld with robin boundary conditions inside a spherical shell

in the case of robin boundary conditions the radial part of the solution is a combination of
bessel functions with derivatives. for the interior case we have bessel functions of the rst kind
and their eigenvalues are determined through

(cid:18)1 

d

2  (cid:19) j (l,n) + l,nj 

 (l,n) = 0.

here we have put  = 1  d/2   and, in the spirit of sect. 3, we have to restrict ourselves to
the case   1  d/2  0. the choice  = 0 represents neumann boundary conditions.

also for this case l, d(l) and n are given by eqs. (4.8)-(4.10), now with

d-ball is

 i = k, () = g ,

(5.1)

and the nonzero modes are separated in polar coordinates, ds2 = dr2 + r2d2, in standard
fashion to be regular at the origin (c is a radial normalisation factor),

5.3 spinor eld with global spectral boundary conditions

we shall now provide the results for spectral boundary conditions [47, 37]. these boundary
conditions are imposed by setting the negative (positive) z-modes of the positive (negative)
chirality parts of , to zero at r = 1, the other modes remaining free.

roughly speaking, spectral conditions amount to requiring that zero-modes of (5.1) should
be square-integrable on the elongated manifold obtained from the ball by extending the narrow
collar (of approximate product metric dr2 + d2) just inside the surface, to values of r ranging
from 1 to . this will be so if the modes of a = raa with negative eigenvalues are suppressed
at the boundary (e.g. [52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]).
from (5.4) and (5.3), the boundary operator is a0 = raa|r=1 and has for eigenstates

(5.9)

a0  z (n)

+
z (n)

 ! = n  z (n)

 ! , a0  z (n)


z (n)

+ ! .
+ ! = n  z (n)


z (n)

+
z (n)

thus, from (5.2) we see that the negative modes of a0 are associated with the radial factor
jn+d/21(kr). taking  as before,  = n + (d  2)/2, the implicit eigenvalue equation reads

j(k) = 0.

the degeneracy for each eigenvalue is

d(n) = 2ds  n + d  2
d  2 ! ,

the relevant boundary zeta function reads now

d(n) = 4 , for d = 2 .

(5.10)

n (s) = 2dsb(2s, d/2  1; d) ,

n (s) = 4r(2s) , for d = 2 .

(5.11)

as we see, apart from the degeneracy of the eigenvalues and the relation between n and the
barnes -function, all the rest of the argumentation is identical to the scalar case with dirichlet
boundary conditions. thus, eqs. (4.3)-(4.7) remain valid once the above denitions are used.

for the exterior space we have to use eqs. (5.10) and (5.11) in eqs. (4.11)-(4.16), but it has
to be noted that here, in contrast with the interior case, l = l + d/2, as a result of the normal
vector changing its sign. this means that there is no  = 0 contribution.

the numerical results for this case are reported in table 4 for d = 2, ..., 9.

6 electromagnetic eld in a perfectly conducting spherical shell

the casimir energy of the electromagnetic eld is, essentially, the sum of a dirichlet and a
robin scalar eld (with a specic value for , see eq. (4.17)), the only dierence being that
the angular momentum l = 0 is omitted. an exception is d = 2 where the vector casimir
eect consists of only the transverse magnetic modes contributions. in detail in the interior of
the shell one has for transverse electric (te), respectively transverse magnetic (tm) modes, the
following boundary conditions [1, 61],

r1d/2j (l,nr)|r=r = 0,

[(d/2  1)j (l,nr) + l,nj 

(l,nr)]|r=r = 0,

for te-modes,
for tm-modes.

(6.1)

the condition for tm-modes is a robin boundary condition with  = 2  d. since the l = 0
mode has to be omitted, the minimum eigenvalue in this case is 1 = d/2 and so we can apply
the method for any  = 2  d > 1  d. thus, in order to get the casimir energy of the
electromagnetic eld we must simply repeat the computation of sect. 4 for dirichlet and robin
boundary conditions with  = 2  d and add them up. we have to exclude everywhere the
l = 0 mode and this means that also the base -function is a little bit modied, in the way

(6.2)

the results for the electromagnetic eld are summarised in table 5. d = 2 is the neumann
result, d = 3 is the well known gure rst obtained by boyer [1] and later established in refs.
[62, 63].

7 conclusions

in ref.
[26] some of the authors of the present paper developed a completely new approach
for nding representations of the zeta function associated with the laplace operator on the
d-dimensional ball. at that stage, dimension by dimension was considered, but soon a rened
and generalised technique was provided in subsequent works [27, 37]. making use of the barnes
zeta function [43], dimension can easily be dealt with as a parameter and several dierent elds
can also be treated on the same footing. the representations derived are valid for all values
of the complex parameter s and it is up to ones choice at which values of s the zeta function
needs to be evaluated. in previous work our concern was of a more mathematical nature and we

casimir energy

table 5: electromagnetic eld in a perfectly conducting spherical shell values of the zeta
function at s = 1/2 inside and outside a spherical shell and values of the casimir energy. it has to
be noted that in even dimensions, in contrast with the scalar eld, the divergences between the inside
and outside energies are dierent. this is due to the fact that (only in even dimensions) the l = 0
mode explicitly contributes to the poles of the -function, but such a contribution is absent for the
electromagnetic case.

considered function values and residues appropriate to nd heat-kernel coecients [26, 27, 37],
as well as the derivative at s = 0 [30]. since then, a number of new methods have been
developed in the literature.

our main aim in the present article has been to show explicitly that casimir energies are
(basically) immediate to obtain from general formulas, also in situations where the boundaries
are not just at plates, the elds are spinorial, and even when the boundary conditions are
quite sophisticate. we have gone much beyond previous work in that we are not restricted here
any more just to a specic eld in a specic dimension with a specic boundary condition, but
give general formulas for (basically) any possible situation that can arise, concerning spherically
symmetric boundaries. in a way, we completely close here the many considerations of the last
decade aecting spherically symmetric boundaries.

where results were already known, we have established contact with them (improving, by
the way, some of the values). for the scalar eld with dirichlet boundary conditions we have
reobtained, in particular, the known result that for d even the energy is divergent [39] and
it remains unclear if there is a natural way to get unambiguously a nite answer. for odd
dimensions, d = 2n  1, the sign of the casimir energy seems to be determined by the sign of
(1)n. for even dimension, d = 2n, one also nds the alternating structure (1)n+1 for the
nite part of the casimir energy; however, its interpretation is unclear due to the presence of the
pole. similar comments hold for the interior and exterior contributions separately, with the same
problems of interpretation. for neumann boundary conditions, in the dimensions calculated,
the casimir energy is negative. similarly, one can describe the results summarized in tables
35. in all cases we have been able to obtain general, exact expressions which, by xing some
parameters, provide us with the desired specic example and yield a numerical answer with, in
principle, arbitrary precision.

disappointing as the mentioned and well known ambiguities may be (specialists in the
eld are just used to them by now), even more so is the fact that no general pattern arises from
our general formulas which might hint towards the physical understanding of the nal sign of
the energy. here we have been able to show once more and without doubt the existence of the
two classes of casimir force: attractive and repulsive, but are unable to give the rule according
to which one or the other appears.
