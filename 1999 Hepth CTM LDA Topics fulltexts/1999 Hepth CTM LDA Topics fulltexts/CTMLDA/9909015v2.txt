abstract

we study the central extensions of the n = 1 superalgebras relevant to the
soliton solutions with the axial geometry  strings, wall junctions, etc. a general
expression valid in any four-dimensional gauge theory is obtained. we prove that
the only gauge theory admitting bps strings at weak coupling is supersymmetric
electrodynamics with the fayet-iliopoulos term. the problem of ambiguity of the
(1/2, 1/2) central charge in the generalized wess-zumino models and gauge theories
with matter is addressed and solved. a possibility of existence of the bps strings at
strong coupling in n = 2 theories is discussed. a representation of dierent strings
within the brane picture is presented.

1 introduction

in the last several years much has been said about the domain walls in various
supersymmetric eld theories in four dimensions [1]. the existence of the bps
saturated domain walls is in one-to-one correspondence with the central extension
of n = 1 superalgebra, with the central charge z lying in the representation {0, 1}
or {1, 0} of the lorentz group (for brevity we will refer to such charges as the (1, 0)
charges). in the non-abelian gauge theories the (1, 0) central charge emerges as a
quantum anomaly in the superalgebra [2]  [4]. the possibility of the existence of
the tensorial central charges in n = 1 superalgebras was noted in the brane context
in ref. [5]. the general theory of the central charges in n = 1 superalgebras was
revisited recently [6].
in this paper we will discuss, in various theories, the central extensions of n = 1
superalgebras with the central charge z  lying in the representation {1/2, 1/2} of
the lorentz group (to be referred to as the (1/2,1/2) charges). such central charges
are related to bps objects with the axial geometry, in particular, the saturated
strings. the fact that they exist is very well known in the context of supersymmetric
qed (sqed) with the fayet-iliopoulos term, see ref.
[7, 8] and especially ref.
[9], specically devoted to this issue.
[9] it is shown, in particular, that
if the spontaneous breaking of u(1) is due to the superpotential (the so-called f
model), then the abrikosov strings cannot be saturated. at the same time, if the
spontaneous breaking of u(1) is due to the fayet-iliopoulos term (the so-called d
model, with the vanishing superpotential) then the abrikosov string is saturated,
one half of supersymmetry is conserved, and the string tension is given by the value
of the central charge. 1

in ref.

another physically interesting example where the (1/2,1/2) charges play a role
is the wall junction. the fact that generalized wess-zumino (gwz) models with a
global symmetry of the u(1) or zn type may contain bps wall junctions was noted
in ref. [10]. the interest to the wall junctions preserving one quarter of the original
supersymmetry was revived recently after the publications [11, 12], discussing such
junctions in some gwz models.

in this work we calculate the central extension of the n = 1 superalgebra of
the z  type for a generic gauge theory, with or without matter. as will be seen, a
spatial integral of a full spatial derivative of the appropriate structure does indeed
emerge. it will be explained how the mass of the saturated solitons with the axial
geometry depends on the combination of the (1, 0) and (1/2, 1/2) central charges.
for the solitons that are pure bps strings (i.e. they posses axial geometry, and their
energy density is completely localized near some axis) only the (1/2, 1/2) charge
can contribute. we found that in the wess-zumino models, as well as in the gauge
theories with matter, the expression for this central charge per se contains certain
terms with coecients which are ambiguous. of critical importance is the ambiguity
1the statements above refer to n = 1 theories. in certain n = 2 extensions of qed one nds

bps saturated strings without the fayet-iliopoulos term. see secs. 4 and 9.3.

in the coecient of the squark term. using this ambiguity, we will prove that in
weak coupling the only n = 1 gauge model admitting the bps strings is sqed
with the fayet-iliopoulos term. we then present some speculative ideas as to the
possibility of the bps strings in the non-abelian models in strong coupling. for the
objects of the type of the wall junctions the ambiguity mentioned above conspires
with a related ambiguity in the (1, 0) central charge, so that the resulting energy of
the wall junction conguration is unambiguous.

2 generalities
let q , q  be supercharges of the n = 1 four-dimensional eld theory under consid-
eration. the central charge relevant to strings, z , appears in the anticommutator

{q , q } = 2p  + 2z 

 2(cid:26)p +z d3x 0 a(cid:27) ()  ,

(1)

where p is the momentum operator, and a is an axial vector specic to the theory
under consideration. it must be built of dynamical elds of the theory. in other
words, the (1/2, 1/2) central charge is

z = z d3x 0 a .

(2)

the corresponding tensor current

j =  a

is obviously conserved nondynamically, irrespective of the concrete form of the axial
current a.

assume that the string is aligned along the vector n (it is normalized by the
condition nn = 1), and l is the length of the string (l is assumed to tend to
innity). then the second term in eq. (1) can be always represented as

z = z d3x 0 a = t l n ,

(3)

where t is a parameter of dimension mass squared. the direction of n can always
be chosen in such a way as to make t in eq. (2) positive. we will always assume
t > 0.

in the rest frame of the string lying along the z direction (i.e. n = {0, 0, 1}, or

n = {0, 0, 0,1}) the superalgebra (1) takes the form
0

{q , q } = 2 " m  t l

0

m + t l # 

,

(4)

2

where m is the total mass of the string. for the saturated strings

m = t l ,

(5)

i.e. the mass of the string coincides with the central charge appearing in the n = 1
superalgebra (1). the parameter t is then identied with the string tension. if the
state of the bps string is denoted | stri, then

q1| stri = q 1| stri = 0 .

(6)

in other words, q1 and q 1 annihilate the string  this half of supersymmetry is
conserved in the saturated string background. the action of q2 and q 2 on | stri
produces the fermion zero modes.
any four-dimensional n = 1 theory can be dimensionally reduced to two di-
mensions, where it becomes n = 2 theory.
if the latter has topologically stable
instantons, elevating the theory back to four dimensions gives us strings. classi-
cal descriptions are totally equivalent. distinctions occur at the level of quantum
corrections, which are to be treated dierently in two- and four-dimensional theo-
ries. the topological charge of the two-dimensional theory is related to the central
charge of the centrally extended algebra (1). this simple observation allows one to
use a wealth of information regarding various two-dimensional models in analysis of
saturated strings in four dimensions at the classical level.

for the solitons of the wall junction type, which preserve a quarter of the original
supersymmetry (more generally, for the bps solitons with the axial geometry), it
is necessary to consider, simultaneously, the (1, 0) charge, which appears in the
commutator

where  is a scalar operator built of the dynamical elds of the theory, and

{qq} = 4i (~) z d3x ~  ,

(~) = {3 , i , 1} .

(7)

(8)

for the bps strings the (1, 0) charge must vanish; however, for the wall junc-
tions and other axial geometry bps solitons both the (1, 0) and (1/2, 1/2) charges
do not vanish (see sec. 3). in this case the general structure of the supercharge
anticommutators is as follows

for saturated objects the master equation (13) expresses the tensions in terms of
two contour integrals over the large circle.

3 generalized wesszumino models

in this section, as a warm up exercise, we will discuss the gwz models which give
rise to the bps solitons with the axial geometry, and derive the (1/2, 1/2) central
charge in these models. the full expression for the (1, 0) central charge was found
previously [4]. the lagrangian has the form

l =

1

4 xi z d2d2  ii +(cid:26)1

2 z d2w(i) + h.c.(cid:27) ,

(14)

4

where i is the set of the chiral elds, and the superpotential w is an analytic
function of the elds i. the original (renormalizable) wesszumino model implies
that w is a cubic polynomial in i. we shall not limit ourselves to this assumption,
keeping in mind that gwz models with more contrived superpotentials can appear
as low-energy limits of some renormalizable microscopic eld theories. the case of
more general kahler potential will be considered later.

the equations of the bps saturation for the solitons with the axial geometry in

this model were rst derived 2 in ref. [4]; they have the form

i


=

1
2

 w
 i

,

where

 = x + iy ,




=

1

2   

x  i

(15)

(16)



y! .

the soliton axis is assumed to lie along the z axis, while the soliton prole depends
on x, y. note that it is not assumed that the solution of eq. (15) is analytic in 
(in fact, one can prove that it must depend on both  and  in the general case).
a constant phase, which could have appeared on the right-hand side of eq. (15), is
absorbed in .

given the solution of eq. (15), one gets two constraints determining the param-

eter of the residual (conserved) supersymmetry,

(1 + 3)  = 0 , i
2

(1  3)  =  ,

(17)

where the spinorial indices of ,  are suppressed (both are assumed to be the upper
indices), and we follow the notations and conventions collected in [4]. the rst
constraint implies that  has only the lower component, which reduces the number
of supersymmetries from four to two; the second constraint further reduces the
number of the residual supersymmetries to one.

in order to calculate the (1, 0) and (1/2, 1/2) central charges one needs the
expression for the supercharges. in fact, since we focus on full derivatives, we need
 j , rather than the supercharges per
to know the supercurrent j 
se. the corresponding expression is well known (see e.g. ref. [4]),

 = (1/2) ()

j  = 22xh(cid:16)

authors meant bps solitons with the axial geometry.

the term in the second line in eq. (18) is conserved by itself. moreover, in the
supercharge it is represented as an integral over the full derivative. below we will
discuss the impact of deleting this term. we will keep it, however, for the time being,
since we want to use the supercurrent which enters in one supermultiplet with the
geometric r current [13] (sometimes called the r0 current). the r0 current is
conserved in conformal theories.

it is not dicult to nd the full derivative terms in {q q } by computing the
canonic commutators of the elds at the tree level [the (1/2, 1/2) central charge
appears already at the tree level]. the task is facilitated if one observes that in
order to get the (1/2, 1/2) central charge it is sucient to keep only the terms of
the mixed symmetry in { q  j }, namely, symmetric in ,  and antisymmetric in
,  or vice versa.

the result of this calculation reduces to eq. (2) with

a =

1

a
()

a

where a

() and a

(20)

(21)

a

() = x   ,

a

() = ix  

  .

the expression for the (1, 0) central charge in the gwz model found previously

[4] at the tree level takes the form of eq. (7) with

(22)

one can check that only the combined contribution of the central charges above
correctly reproduces the mass of the bps solitons with the axial geometry, e.g. the
wall junctions. indeed, eq. (13) implies that in the model at hand 3

3the term (1/3)kk( ) is irrelevant both for strings and wall junctions, since it vanishes in
the both cases. it contributes, however, in the energy of the axial geometry solitons of the type
discussed in [4]. this term occurs in passing from the canonic energy-momentum tensor

or

at rst sight it might seem that eqs.

(23) and (25) contradict each other,
since the axial current contribution to the soliton mass in these two expressions
(corresponding to the (1/2, 1/2) central charge) has dierent coecients (cf. 2 +
(4/3) in the rst case and 2 in the second). upon inspection one sees that eq.
(23) has a dierent expression for the (1, 0) central charge too. the dierence is

this relation immediately implies the coincidence of the soliton masses ensuing from
eqs. (23) and (25), respectively.

in fact, the supercial dierence between them is due to the ambiguity in the
choice of the supercurrent (the terms with the full derivatives in eq.
(18)) and
the corresponding ambiguity in the energy-momentum tensor. equation (23) is de-
rived on the basis of the supercurrent and the energy-momentum tensor with the
properties j  = 0, 
 = 0 in the conformal limit. passing to the minimal su-
percurrent and the canonic energy-momentum tensor one drops all terms containing
the factor 1/3 in eq. (23) and recovers eq. (25). the mass of the soliton stays
intact due to a reshuing of contributions due to (1/2, 1/2) and (1, 0) charges.

to illustrate the point let us consider, for instance, a zn model suggested in ref.

[14], with the superpotential

w = n (

vacuum manifold corresponds to n points,

k = n exp  2ik

the solution of the bps saturation equation for an isolated wall exists,
discussed in [14]. (here and below n will be assumed large, and only leading terms
in n will be kept.) the tension of the minimal wall connecting the neighboring
vacua is

t = 2|w| = 4n .

(30)

consider the bps wall junctions of the type depicted in fig. 2. assuming that
there is a solution of eq. (15), to the leading order in n one can write (at ||  )
(31)

{w1, w2} = {rew , imw} .

8

(32)

which is exactly the mass of n isolated walls inside the contour. furthermore,

2i dnksk = 4n 2r

3

n 2 .

(34)

the total mass of the junction conguration comes out the same from both expres-
sions, eqs. (23) and (25),

m
l

= 4n 2r  2n 2 ,

(35)

(see also [15]). the rst term can be interpreted as the mass of the spokes joined
at the origin, while the second as that of the hub.

let us remark that the stringy (hub) contribution to the total mass equals
to twice the area of the contour on the  plane covered by the solution. since we
consider the junction with n minimal domain walls connecting the neighboring
vacua, the contour is closed. the closeness is nothing but the equilibrium condition
at the junction line.

summarizing, we observe an ambiguity in the (1/2, 1/2) central charge. this
ambiguity is due to the fact that both, the supercurrent and the energy-momentum
tensor, are not uniquely determined. both admit certain full derivative terms which
are conserved by themselves and, therefore, do not aect the supercharges and
the energy-momentum four-vector. they do aect the expressions for the central
charges, however. for the soliton solutions of the wall junction type the ambiguity in
the (1/2, 1/2) central charge combines with another ambiguity, in the (1, 0) central
charge, to produce an unambiguous expression for the soliton mass. as we will
see shortly, the same ambiguity (and a similar conspiracy) takes place in the gauge
theories with matter.

practically, it is more convenient to work with the minimal supercurrents (and
the canonic energy-momentum tensor). then, one omits the second line in eq. (18).

4 sqed with the fayet-iliopoulos term

the simplest theory (and the only one in the class n = 1, see below) where saturated
strings exist in the weak coupling regime is supersymmetric electrodynamics (susy
qed, or sqed), with the fayet-iliopoulos (fi) term. in the supereld notation the
lagrangian of the model has the form

l = (cid:26) 1

8 e2 z d2 w 2 + h.c.(cid:27) +

1

4 z d4(cid:16) sev s + t ev t(cid:17)

4 z d2d2  v (x, , ) ,

(37)

where e is the electric charge, s and t are two chiral superelds with the electric
charges +1 and 1, respectively,  is the coecient of the fayet-iliopoulos term.
the model with one chiral supereld is internally anomalous. topologically stable
solutions in this model and its modications were considered more than once in the
past [7, 8, 9]. we combine various elements scattered in the literature, with a special
emphasis on the algebraic aspect. supersymmetry of this model is minimal, n = 1.
if  6= 0, the vacuum state corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of u(1).
the spectrum of the model is that of a massive vector supermultiplet (one massive
vector eld, one real scalar and one dirac fermion, all of one and the same mass),
plus a massless modulus (one chiral supereld) parametrized by the product st ,

 = 2st .

(38)

the vacuum valley is represented by the one-dimensional complex manifold with
the kahler function

k( , ) = q2 +   .

(39)

in a generic point nonsingular abrikosov strings do not exist [8]. there is one special
point, however,  = 0, where the theory supports the saturated string.

in components the lagrangian of sqed (37) has the form (in the wess-zumino

gauge)

l = 

1
4e2 ff  + (d) d + (d) d

where  and  are the lowest components of the superelds s and t , respectively,
with the electric charges 1, e.g.

d =   ia ,

[d ,d] = if .

(41)

without loss of generality we can assume that  > 0.

for the static eld congurations, assuming in addition that all elds depend

only on x and y and a0 = a3 = 0, one gets the energy functional in the form

it is instructive to compare the topological term in eq. (43) with the central
charge of the superalgebra. to derive the central charge one needs the expression
for the supercurrent in sqed, which takes the form (in the spinorial notation)

(49)

above it is assumed that there is no superpotential. the second line may or may
not be added, at will. (the second line in eq. (49) is conserved by itself; in the
supercharge it presents a full spatial derivative, hence, its contribution vanishes.)
the sum runs over various matter supermultiplets, in particular, s and t in the
case at hand.

to nd the central charge one must compute the anticommutator {q , j  }.
moreover, we decompose the anticommutator above with respect to irreducible rep-
resentations of the lorentz group, by singling out the symmetric and antisymmetric

11

combinations of the dotted and undotted indices. the one which is symmetric with
respect to both pairs, (, ) and (  ), is the lorentz spin 2 (the energy-momentum
tensor), which contributes to p , rather than to the central charge. the combina-
tion which is antisymmetric with respect to both pairs, (, ) and (  ) is lorentz
singlet, it represents the trace terms in the energy-momentum tensor. to single out
the central charge we must isolate the terms of the mixed symmetry, i.e. symmetric
with respect to (, ) and antisymmetric with respect to (  ), and vice versa.

keeping in mind this remark, and using the canonic commutation relations and
equations of motion for the d eld we get an expression similar to that in the
wess-zumino model, plus an extra contribution due to the d term,

{q q } = iz d3xhf   f   i .

note that the coecient of the

 term cannot contribute to the central charge under consideration.

 (i.e. the selectron axial current) term
is ambiguous  it depends on whether the second line in eq. (49) is included in
the denition of the supercurrent. the result quoted above refers to the minimal
supercurrent, with the second line in eq. (49) discarded. since the (1, 0) central
charge is irrelevant for the string solution, this ambiguity alone shows that the
 d
it is
certainly the case, since d  falls o suciently fast at r   (where r is the
distance to the string axis) for the string solution. at the same time, the photon four-
potential a falls o slowly, as 1/r. thus, the (1/2, 1/2) central charge is saturated
by the  term exclusively. the latter is unambiguously xed in eq. (51), i.e. it does
not depend on the full derivative terms in the supercurrent. the (1/2, 1/2) central
charge is obviously proportional to  and to the magnetic ux of the string,

with the vanishing fayet-iliopoulos term and linear superpotential, see sec. 9.3.

5 the kahler sigma models

in this section we present some arguments concerning strings in the four-dimensional
 models on the kahler manifolds. the two-dimensional reductions of these models
are well studied, in the euclidean formulation they admit instantons, which are the
solutions of the rst order self-duality equations.
in the supersymmetric version
the self-duality equations in two dimensions are reinterpreted as the bps equations
in higher-dimensional theories (e.g.
[16]). it is obvious that the instantons of the
two-dimensional models are the bps strings in four dimensions. thus, the four-
dimensional  models on the kahler manifolds do have the bps strings at the
quasiclassical level, at weak coupling. keeping in mind the assertion we are going
to prove later (sec. 8) we discuss where the kahler sigma models stand compared
to other models.

let us start with the cp1 model. in a sense, this model can be obtained as a
limiting case of sqed with a somewhat dierent matter content compared to that of
sec. 4 (see, for instance, [17]). indeed, assume that the matter superelds s and t
have both charges +1, rather than 1. as a quantum theory, it is anomalous, but for
the time being we limit ourselves to the classical consideration. the limit to be taken
is e2  . let us have a closer look at eq. (40), with the sign of the charge of the
 eld reversed [correspondingly, the d term takes the form d = e2( +  )].
in this limit the photon mass tends to innity, the photon becomes nondynamical
and can be eliminated. it drags with itself two real scalar degrees of freedom. the
remaining two scalar degrees of freedom are massless. their interaction reduces to
the sigma model on a sphere. this is most easily seen from eq. (40). in the limit
e2   the d term must vanish, which implies that  +  = . in fact, the
gauge freedom allows one to identically eliminate one out of four degrees of freedom
residing in , . the remaining three are subject to the constraint, telling us that
the radius of the sphere is .

thus, the sqed with the fayet-iliopoulos term, in the limit e2  , gives rise

to the model with the action

s =

1

2g2 z d4xd2d2  ln(cid:16)1 + (cid:17)

where  is a chiral supereld,

(xl, ) = (xl) + 2(xl) + 2f (xl) .

(55)

(56)

the coupling constant 2/g2 has the dimension of mass squared and is equal to .
the string tension will be proportional to 2/g2 = . the metric of the sphere in the
target space g in this case is

g =

2
g2

1

(1 + )2 .

(57)

the energy functional for the stringy solution takes the form which looks exactly
as the action in the euclidean two-dimensional sigma model whose world volume is

13

transverse to the string. it is easy to rewrite it in terms of the topological charge
plus a positive denite contribution,

e
l

= z d2x


8

g2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

+

1

g2 


 i  

1 +  



,

(58)

where the second term, the integral over the full derivative, presents the topological
charge and the integral runs in the plane transverse to the string. instantons saturate
the topological charge; since 2(s2) = z, the saturated solutions are labeled by an
integer n, equal to the topological charge. the surface term contribution in eq. (58)
is thus proportional to g2n = n.

in four dimensions the instantons present the bps saturated strings. these
strings are rather peculiar. since the two-dimensional theory is classically (su-
per)conformally invariant, the two-dimensional instantons can have any size (cor-
respondingly, the cross section of the string in four-dimensional theory can be ar-
bitrary). the larger is the transverse size of the string the smaller is the energy
density in the string. however, the string tension remains constant proportional
to g2 = . this is the limiting prole of the abrikosov string in sqed with the
fayet-iliopoulos term  the prole it acquires when the vector eld mass tends to
innity while the remaining degrees of freedom of the matter elds remain massless.
for our purposes it is important to interpret the surface term contribution in
the string tension in terms of the (1/2, 1/2) central charge of the four-dimensional
sqed. upon inspecting eq. (51) we conclude that this contribution comes from
the rst term in eq. (51). the eld a is not dynamical in the limit under consid-
eration, and is expressible in terms of the residual scalars. since our consideration
is quasiclassical, it is not surprising that the current of the matter fermions does
not contribute. the second term in eq. (51) does not contribute either  as was
discussed, its coecient is ambiguous.

the o(3) (or cp1) model belongs to a more general class of cpn models. the
latter can be derived as the low-energy limit of sqed with the fi term and with
n + 1 chiral matter superelds (all of them have charge +1), in the limit e2  .
one can eliminate the nondynamical a eld, much in the same way as in cp1,
arriving in this way at a nonlinear sigma model.
one has to introduce complex coordinates wj

i = i/j where i 6= j which can be
i . the action can be

considered as the scalar components of the chiral superelds j
written in terms of j

i as follows

s =

1

2g2 z d4xd2d2  ln

1 +xi,j

j

i
i j
 .

(59)

the identication  = 1/g2 is transparent since both parameters determine the size
of the target manifold in two formulations.

the general expression for the central charge is [12]

z = z d2xn (cid:16)k  k 

(cid:17) + (k 

  k)o ,

(60)

14

where the complex variable  is dened in eq. (16) the subscripts ,  denote the
,  partial derivatives of the kahler metric.

more generally, we expect similar strings for all toric varieties which can be
presented as low energy limits of gauged linear sigma model. in sec. 9 we shall
encounter one more example of the kahler sigma model coupled to the abelian
gauge eld  the low-energy eective action for n = 2 susy yang-mills theory in
four dimensions.

6 supersymmetric gluodynamics

to begin with, consider the simplest non-abelian gauge model, susy gluodynamics.
the lagrangian is

l =

1

4g2 z d2 tr w 2 + h.c. ,

(61)

where w = w at a, and t a are the generators of the gauge group g in the fundamen-
tal representation. although the gauge group g can be arbitrary, for deniteness
we limit ourselves to su(n). in components

l =

1

g2 (cid:26)

1
4

ga
ga + iad 

a (cid:27) .

(62)

there is a supermultiplet of the classically conserved currents (for a recent review
see e.g. [18]),

j  = 

4

g2 trhev wev w i

= r  nij  + h.c.o  2  

 j   + . . . ,

(63)

where r  is the chiral current, j  is the supercurrent, and j   is a combination
of the energy-momentum tensor    = () ()   and a full derivative
appearing in the central charge, namely,

r  = 

4
g2 tr  ,

j  = ()  j , =

j   =    

i
4

4i
g2 tr g   ,
i
4

+

{  r
}

   { r 
}

,

   =

2

g2 trhi {d} 

   i (cid:16)d{ (cid:17)  } + g g  i .

(64)

the symmetrization over ,  or ,  is marked by the braces. in fact, since the
chiral current is classically conserved (so far we disregard anomalies), symmetriza-
tion in the third line is superuous: the corresponding expressions are automatically

15

symmetric. to obtain the expression on the right-hand side from trhev wev w i
we observe that the expression for j   has mixed symmetry: the part symmet-
ric in { , } and {  , } is the (1, 1) lorentz tensor, it represents the (traceless)
energy-momentum tensor. the remainder, i.e. the part symmetric in { , } and
antisymmetric in {  , } or vice versa, is the (0, 1) + (1, 0) lorentz tensor. the part
antisymmetric in both { , } and {  , } is (0, 0). it represents the traces which
vanish in the classical approximation. it is quite obvious that the only part relevant
for the central charge is (0, 1) + (1, 0) piece in j  . this means, in particular, that
the inclusion of the traces will have no impact on the central charge.

it is easy to see that

combining this equation with the third line in eq.
centrally extended algebra is given by eq. (1) with

nq , j  o = 2j   .

(65)

(64) we conclude that the

a =

1
4

r .

(66)

unlike the central extension relevant for the domain walls, which appears [2] 
[4] as a quantum anomaly, in the problem at hand the algebra gets a full-derivative
term at the tree level. the presence of the anomaly manifests itself through the
fact that the energy-momentum tensor ceases to be traceless, and r no more
vanishes. on general grounds it is clear, however, that eqs. (1), (66) stay intact.

the occurrence of a full-derivative term in the algebra presents a precondition
for a nontrivial central extension. whether or not this term actually vanishes is a
dynamical issue which depends on the presence of the string-like solitons. these
may be strings, or domain-wall junctions, as in ref.
[12]. susy gluodynamics is
a strongly coupled theory; therefore, one cannot use quasiclassical considerations
to search/analyze solitons. the hope is that there is a dual description in terms
of eective degrees of freedom, for which quasiclassical analysis may be relevant.
within this dual description the second term in eq.
(1) is mapped onto some
relevant operator of the eective theory.
it is clear that the second term in eq.
(1) is the necessary but not sucient condition for the existence of the saturated
strings. if it were absent, there would be no hope.

7 generic non-abelian model with matter

the (1/2, 1/2) central charge in the generic non-abelian theory is obtained by com-
bining the expressions we have derived in the previous sections. the operator a in
eq. (1) receives contributions from the gluino term, as in sec. 6, which is unambigu-
ous, and the contributions from matter (both, the scalar and spinor components of
matter enter), as in the generalized wess-zumino model (sec. 3), whose coecients
are not xed  they depend on how one denes the supercurrent in those terms that

16

are total derivatives. this ambiguity derives its origin from that in the denition of
the supercurrents,

2

j  =



(cid:17) + 22xh(cid:16)d (cid:17)   if  i



 + daa
a

g2 (cid:16)iga
2
3 xh () +  ()  3

 ()i ,

(67)

where the sum runs over all matter supermultiplets, da and f are the corresponding
d and f terms. the second line is conserved by itself, nondynamically; the spatial
integral of the time-like component reduces to the integral over the total derivative
for the second line. therefore, it may or may not be included in the denition
of the supercurrents. this is the supersymmetric analog of the ambiguity in the
energy-momentum tensor in nonsupersymmetric theories with the scalar elds. the
ambiguity in the choice of j  leads, with necessity, to the fact that the coecients
of the matter terms in a in eq. (1), namely, a
(), are not uniquely xed.
due to this ambiguity, the matter component of a cannot contribute to z for
strings (it could contribute, though, for the wall junctions and other similar object
with the axial geometry).

() and a

8 strings cannot be saturated in n = 1 non-

abelian gauge theories in weak coupling

here we will prove that in the absence of the u(1) factors, even if the theory under
consideration does support string-like solitons in the quasiclassical consideration
(some examples are discussed e.g.
[19]), the central charge vanishes with
necessity. therefore, these strings cannot be saturated.

in ref.

in weak coupling (i.e.

for the string solitons in the quasiclassical treatment)
the (1/2, 1/2) central charge must be saturated by the term with the bosonic axial
current. (we remind that the fi term is absent). as was explained, the coecient
of this term is not unambiguous  it depends on the denition of the supercurrent
(e.g. minimal versus conformal). since we are interested in the string solitons,
rather than the wall junctions, this ambiguity cannot be canceled by that in the
(1, 0) central charge, since the latter must identically vanish. this is dictated by the
lorentz symmetry arguments. this means that the (1/2, 1/2) central charge must
vanish identically.

the consideration above shows that if the bps objects with the axial geometry
exist in the quasiclassical limit (in non-abelian gauge theories), the stringy core
must be accompanied by objects with the (1, 0) charges. in four dimensions domain
walls do the job. within the brane picture it is possible to consider four-dimensional
theories as that on the brane embedded in m theory. for instance, the expected
domain wall junctions in n = 1 yang-mills theory  the gauge analog of the junc-

17

tions in the gwz models  can be identied as a junction of m5 branes, so that the
denition of the current for the theory on m5 removes any ambiguity.

9 strings in the seiberg-witten n = 2 model

here we will speculate on possible bps strings at strong coupling. as we already
know, such strings do not appear in weak coupling. the (1/2, 1/2) central charge
(appearing in the anticommutator {q, q}) is not holomorphic  it need not depend
holomorphically on the chiral parameters, in contradistinction with the (1, 0) charge.
this means, that even if both the weak and strong coupling regimes are attainable
in one and the same theory, generally speaking, nothing can be said regarding the
bps strings in the strong coupling regime from the behavior at weak coupling.

9.1 strings in pure n = 2 yang-mills theory
turn now to discussion of the n = 2 yang-mills theory without matter hypermul-
tiplets. the exact solution for the low-energy eective action, as well as the exact
spectrum of the bps particles, are known [20]. now we address the issue of possi-
ble stringy central charges, besides the standard ones, saturated by particles [21].
from the discussion above we saw that it can be attributed only to the gluino axial
current since there is no fi term in the model. let us restrict ourselves to su(2)
gauge group.

the key features of the seiberg-witten solution can be summarized as follows.
the vacuum manifold develops the coulomb branch which is parametrized by the
global coordinate, the order parameter u = htr2i. at low energies the eective the-
ory becomes abelian and is described by a single holomorphic function  prepotential
f which determines the eective coupling constant of the theory  = 2f /a2, as
well as the kahler metric on the coulomb branch of the moduli space, which ap-
pears to be a one-dimensional special kahler manifold. the kahler potential can
be found from the prepotential as follows

k(a, a) = imada

(68)

where a is the vacuum value of the third component of the scalar eld and ad =
f /a. the variable a can be expressed in terms of variable u as follows:

.

(69)

a(u) = z u2
u+2

x2dx

q(x2  u)2  4

unlike the variable u, the variable a cannot be considered as a global coordi-
nate on the moduli space since the kahler metric im (a) has zeros (here  is the
complexied coupling constant). therefore, to analyze the complex plane of a, an
explicit expression for a(u) is needed. a direct inspection shows that the region of
small a is essentially removed from the complex plane so that |a(u)| > const .

18

the lower bound on a can be seen also geometrically if we recall that it is just
the mass of the w boson, which can be represented in the theory on d3 probe as
the pronged string connecting the probe and the split o7 orientifold [22]. it is clear
that the minimal mass of the w boson geometrically is the distance between the
7-branes on the u plane; it is, thus, proportional to . therefore, we see that 1 of
the scalar eld manifold is nontrivial  topologically stable objects with the axial
geometry are expected, provided a winds around the forbidden region.

whether these objects are strings (i.e. have nite energy per unit length) depends
on dynamics, on how fast the volume energy density dies o as we go away from
the axis in the perpendicular direction. the convergence could be ensured by the
appropriate form of the kahler metric, as in the sigma models. it is quite obvious,
that in this case the string tension

t = const 2 .

(70)

the existence of such the stable objects with the axial geometry would be a
purely strong coupling eect since at the classical level the point a = 0 is attainable,
and, correspondingly, 1 is trivial. if the strings do exist, they may be bps-saturated
provided the term due to the gluino current r in the central charge is nonvanisihing.
to this end the gluino current must fall o at large distances r from the axis as 1/r.
finiteness of the string tension would imply then that eective degrees of freedom
coupled to r form a u(1) gauge interaction. if the string tension is nite and the
gluino current falls o at large distances r from the axis faster than 1/r, the string
is tensionless.

9.2 strings in n =2 sqcd
adding the matter hypermultiplets to the model discussed in sec. 9.1 we get n =2
sqcd. since there is no restoration of the su(2) gauge symmetry at the generic
point at the coulomb branch, the forbidden region on the complex a plane exists
in the theory with the fundamental matter too. the bps strings may appear on the
coulomb branch, with the tension saturated by the r current of gluinos. the tension
now depends on the masses of the fundamental matter and can be determined, in
principle, from the explicit expression for a(u, , m).

moreover, the higgs branch (parametrized by the vacuum expectation values
of the fundamentals hqi, h qi) is possible, and the question of the bps strings
on the higgs branch can be addressed. we recall that geometrically the higgs
branch is the hyper-kahler manifold [23] (for a review see [24]) whose metric can
be determined classically. it is not renormalized by quantum corrections. actually,
the higgs branch for su(nc) theory with nf avors is the cotangent bundle of the
grassmannian t grnc,nf , with the antisymmetric nc -form. the metric on this
manifold can be found from the kahler potential

k(q, q) = trqk2 + mm ,

19

(71)

where k is a solution of the equation

det (cid:16)k1nf +qk21nf + mm(cid:17) = det (qq) ,

and m = q q is the meson matrix.

(72)

since 2(grn,k) 6= 0, instantons in the two-dimensional sigma model on t grn,k
are possible. the arguments presented in sec. 5 suggest that these instantons can
be interpreted as strings on the higgs branch. it would be interesting to understand
whether a version of the string on the higgs branch recently found in [25] can be
bps saturated.

the existence of the bps string on the higgs branch was recently conjectured
within the brane approach [26]. this string was expected to be tensionless at the
root of the higgs branch, which qualitatively agrees with the discussion above.

9.3 softly broken n =2 theory (strings in n = 2 sqed)
if the softly broken n = 2 yang-mills theory is considered near the monopole or
dyon singularities the eective low-energy theory which ensues is n = 2 dual sqed.
this is the famous seiberg-witten result. a small mass term of the chiral superelds
of the original n =2 non-abelian theory is translated in a small perturbation of the
superpotential for the matter elds in sqed. if the monopole (or dyon) superelds
are denoted as m, m the superpotential in the low-energy sqed can be written as

w =  u(ad) + m adm ,

(73)

where ad is a chiral supereld which is the n = 2 superpartner of the (dual)
vector supereld. the second term in eq. (73) is xed by n = 2 supersymmetry.
the parameter  in the rst term is small. generically  u(ad) breaks n = 2
supersymmetry down to n = 1. however, in the linear approximation, when

w = ad + m adm ,

(74)

n = 2 is unbroken.
let us forget about the origin of n = 2 sqed and discuss this u(1) theory with
the superpotential (74) per se. minimization of the potential stemming from (74)
yields the monopole condensation. the abrikosov strings obviously do exist. their
tension is proportional to . they were discussed in the literature previously [27, 28].

saturated. the question is how this could happen given that the (1/2, 1/2) central
charge must vanish in the absence of the fi term.

the central charge in the anticommutator {q q } is indeed zero. one should
not forget however, that sqed with the superpotential (74) is an n = 2 theory 
there exist two supercharges q, q of the type (1/2, 0) and two supercharges q, q

of the type (0, 1/2). therefore, one should look for the central extension in the
anticommutator of the general form {q q } where q is a linear combination of q
and q. a nonvanishing cenral term of this type does exist.
if we now return to the original non-abelian n =2 theory, we conclude that at
small  the string is (approximately) bps saturated. it becomes exactly saturated in
the limit   0 ,    with  xed [27, 28]. the saturation is approximate,
rather than exact, since higher order terms in  (non-linear in ad terms in the
superpotential of the low-energy u(1) theory) break n = 2 and return us back to
the n = 1 theory. in n = 1 the extra supercharges q, q disappear, while the
central charge in the anticommutator {q q } vanishes.

10 the brane picture: how it corresponds to

field theory

10.1 the fayet-iliopoulos string as a membrane

with the brane picture in mind, we can look for the brane conguration corre-
sponding to the bps strings discussed above. the interpretation of the strings
whose tension is proportional to the four-dimensional fi terms is rather simple. let
us consider the brane conguration relevant for the abelian n = 2 yang-mills the-
ory in the iia picture. it consists of the pair of the parallel ns5 branes with the
worldvolumes (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), plus a single d4 brane with the worldvolume
(x0, x1, x2, x3, x6). the gauge theory is dened on the worldvolume of the d4 brane,
and the distance between the ns5 branes along the x6 direction plays the role of the
inverse coupling in the abelian theory. since the four-dimensional fi terms have the
meaning of the relative distance between the ns branes in (x7, x8, x9) [29], the fi
strings are nothing but the d2 branes stretched between the ns branes in some of
(x7, x8, x9) directions. the rest of their worldvolume coordinates coincide with the
d4 ones.

this picture gets slightly modied if one considers the abelian n = 1 theory.
according to the well-known procedure (see, for instance, [29]), one has then to
rotate one of the ns5 branes, which now has (x0, x1, x2, x3, x8, x9) as the worldvol-
ume. the fayet-iliopoulos term has now the meaning of the displacement of the
ns5 branes along x7. the d2 brane stretched between the ns5 branes with the
worldvolume (x0, x1, x7) plays the role of the bps string.

let us note that the fi string can be elevated smoothly in the m theory. indeed,
the ns5 branes and the d4 brane can be identied with the single m5 brane in the
m theory. the fi string can be considered as an m2 brane stretched between two
components of the m5 branes. the tension of the fi string is proportional to the
length of the m2 brane along the x7 direction and, therefore, proportional to the
value of the fi parameter , in full agreement with the eld theory expectations.
recently a similar picture for the fi strings was discussed in [26].

10.2 on (conjectured) strong coupling bps strings via

branes

the bps saturated objects with the axial geometry were discussed in the brane
picture previously. for instance, the domain wall junction in n = 1 supersymmetric
gluodynamics which is expected to saturate both, the (1/2, 1/2) and (1, 0) central
charges, occurs as the intersection of the m5 branes, since the domain walls were
identied as the m5 branes wrapped on 4-manifold in m theory [30].

here we would like to add a few remarks on a possible interpretation of the strong
coupling bps strings in the brane picture. previous attempts to recognize bps
tensionless string in four dimensions, apparently seen within the brane approach
[31], were based on the intersection of the m5 branes or the m2 brane stretched
between two m5 branes. the bps string on the coulomb branch discussed in sec. 9
is nothing but a wrapped m5 brane, since its tension is proportional to the area on
the region on the coulomb branch. however, the explicit geometry of intersection
of the m5 branes yielding saturation of the (1/2, 1/2) central charge is still to be
claried.

another possible approach to the brane interpretation of the bps strings in the
yang-mills theories follows from the correspondence between the yang-mills theories
in four dimensions and two-dimensional sigma models. it was recently recognized
[32, 33, 34] that there is a close relation between the two-dimensional cpn models
(which have n = 2) and the yang-mills theories in four dimensions, with n = 1 or
n = 2, with or without fundamental matter. in the latter case the correspondence
relies on the coincidence of the spectra of the bps domain walls in four dimensions
and bps solitons in two.

a more direct relation connects the n = 2 theory with nf avors at the root
of the baryonic branch of the moduli space with the cp2ncnf1 model [33, 34].
the translation dictionary between the two models looks as follows: the complex
coupling in four dimensions corresponds to a complex parameter combining the two-
dimensional fi term with the  term; twisted mass terms in d = 2 correspond to
the coordinates on the coulomb branch in the d = 4 theory; nally, the riemann
surfaces providing the bps spectra in both theories are the same.

the correspondence above has a rather simple explanation in the brane descrip-
tion of both theories.
it appears that the brane congurations for both theories
are actually the same. the d = 4 theory is dened on the worldvolume of the d4
branes stretched between a pair of the ns5 branes. the coupling constant is just
the distance between the ns5 branes. in m theory all branes above are elevated
to a pair of the m5 branes, one of which is at and the second is wrapped around
the riemann surface. the conguration is described by the holomorphic embedding
into four-dimensional space

where the rst factor represents the at brane, while the second the curved one, and
mis correspond to the masses of the fundamental hypermultiplets.

let us add a d2 brane and consider the abelian gauge theory on its worldvolume.
if the d2 brane is stretched between the same ns5 branes we arrive at the cpn
model in d = 2 where it has the extended supersymmetry, n = 2. this explains
the coincidence between the complexied coupling constant in the four-dimensional
theory and the fi term in the two-dimensional theory. therefore, the picture can be
apparently interpreted as follows: the d = 2 sigma model, with the twisted masses
added, is the theory on the brane which is the probe for the n = 2 low-energy
theory in four dimensions.
in [33, 34] it was shown that the spectrum of the bps particles in n = 2 theory
at the root of the baryonic branch exactly coincides with the spectrum of bps
dyonic kinks in the corresponding cpn model. moreover, the brane identication
shows that the hypermultiplets in d = 4 and d = 2 arise essentially in the same
way. therefore, we can use the relation between the models in a two-fold way. the
existence of instantons in the cpn model implies that one can expect bps saturated
strings at the root of the baryonic branch. in the opposite direction, the (1/2, 1/2)
central charge in four dimensions can be mapped into the central charge of the
n = 2 two-dimensional theory. since in the formulation of the sigma model with
the nondynamical vector eld, the gauge 2-potential plays the role of the current
a in eq. (1), the central charge is actually mapped onto the chern number r adx.

certainly, these issues need further clarication. we hope to discuss them elsewhere.

11 conclusions and discussion

in this paper we elaborated the generic structure of of the central charges in su-
persymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions. the central nding is that the
(1/2, 1/2) charge is ambiguous in the part related to the matter elds, due to possi-
ble total derivative terms in the supercurrents. the part related to the gauge elds
(including gaugino) is unambiguous. that is why in the weak coupling regime the
only model admitting bps strings is sqed with the fayet-iliopoulos term. in the
non-abelian theories the fayet-iliopoulos term is forbidden; hence, at weak coupling
there can be no bps strings. even if some strings exist, they are nonsaturated with
necessity. these assertions are proven at the theorem level.

the ambiguity we found does not preclude from existence other bps saturated
the wall junctions. the ambiguity in the
objects with the axial geometry, i.e.
(1/2, 1/2) charge is combined with that in the (1, 0) charge to produce a well-dened
answer for the tension of the walls and the hub in the middle. we presented some
examples.

the strong coupling regime is a dierent story. since the analyticity argument
does not apply to the (1/2, 1/2) charge, the existence/non-existence of the bps
strings should be discussed separately at weak and strong couplings  the lessons

23

we learn at weak coupling say nothing about possible scenarios at strong coupling.
we speculated on dierent cases when the bps-saturated objects with axial geom-
etry may appear in the strong coupling regime. we argued that saturation of the
(1/2, 1/2) charge at strong coupling can be attributed to the m5 brane intersection.
(the fayet-iliopoulos bps strings come from the m2 branes.) the bps-saturated
strings may be expected in the n = 2 yang-mills theories on the coulomb branch.
in the n = 1 gauge theories an obvious candidate for the bps saturation is the
domain wall junction. one cannot assert at the moment with absolute certainty that
the strong coupling junction exists in n = 1 supersymmetric gluodynamics, but the
m theory arguments suggest that such junctions do exist. additional support in
favor of this conclusion is provided by eld-theoretic models considered in [15].

a comment is in order regarding the situation in supergravity coupled to the
yang-mills theory. upon inspecting the (1/2, 1/2) central charge one nds the term
h = db  k in the anticommutator {q, q}, where b is the two-form eld and
k = ada  2
3 a3 is the dual of the chern-simons current in the yang-mills theory.
therefore, we see that the axial current of gluons enters into the central charge, if
gravity degrees of freedom are taken into account. we plan to discuss this point in
more detail elsewhere.

since the n = 2 yang-mills theory enjoys duality, one can pose a question of
the duality partner of the bps string. four-dimensional bps strings can be viewed
as objects dual (in the dirac sense) to localized objects. indeed, since in d space-
time dimensions the p brane is dual to a (d  p  4) brane, the dirac quantization
condition amounts to the observation that the (d  p  4) brane is weakly coupled
if the p brane is strongly coupled and vice versa. therefore, one can expect that
within the framework of duality the strongly coupled bps string has something to
do with the instantons at weak coupling.

to make a conjecture regarding the central charge dualizing the stringy one, let us
observe that there is a contribution in the central charge for {q, q} in six dimensions,
saturated by instantonic strings. in ve dimensions the instanton presents a particle
with mass 1/g2, saturating [35] the central charge r d4x f f . in four dimensions we

can expect a remnant of this central charge resulting from dimensional reduction.
