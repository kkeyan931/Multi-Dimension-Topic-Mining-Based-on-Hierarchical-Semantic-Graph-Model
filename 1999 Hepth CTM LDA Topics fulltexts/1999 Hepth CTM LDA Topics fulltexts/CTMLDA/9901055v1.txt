abstract

we consider two inequivalent truncations of the super d9brane: the heterotic
and the type i truncation. both of them lead to an n = 1 nonlinear super-
symmetrization of the d = 10 cosmological constant. the propagating degrees of
freedom in the heterotic and type i truncation are given by the components of a
d = 10 vector multiplet and a single majorana-weyl spinor, respectively. as a
by-product we nd that, after the type i truncation, the ramond-ramond super
ten-form provides an interesting reformulation of the volkov-akulov action. these
results can be extended to all dimensions in which spacetime lling d-branes exist,
i.e. d = 3, 4, 6 and 10.

introduction

it is well-known that the dynamics of dpbranes [1] is described by a dirac-born-infeld
(dbi) action [2]. for super dpbranes the kappasymmetric generalization of the dbi
action has been given in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]5. the case p = 9 corresponds to a spacetime
lling brane, the super d9brane.
it leads to a supersymmetrization of the d = 10
born-infeld (bi) action in a iib supergravity background [5]. for a at background the
explicit supersymmetry rules, after gauge-xing the worldvolume reparametrizations and
the kappasymmetry, have been given in [7]. the super d9brane has also been studied
in [9]. spacetime lling branes in d = 6 have recently been discussed in [10].

the d9branes play an important role in the description of the type i so(32) super-
string in the sense that they provide the chan-paton factors of the open superstring. in
this description a truncation is performed using the worldsheet parity operator  [11]. this
leads to a specic type i truncation of the iib supergravity background. in the sdual
version the d9-branes are replaced by ns9b branes, the worldsheet parity operator  by
the fermion number operator ()fl and the type i so(32) superstring by the heterotic
so(32) superstring [12, 13]. the truncation using ()fl leads to a so-called heterotic
truncation of iib supergravity. both the type i and heterotic truncations preserve a linear
n = 1 supersymmetry of the supergravity elds.

it is the purpose of this letter to extend the heterotic and type i truncations of the
iib supergravity background to the action for a single super d9brane 6. we nd that
in both cases the surviving n = 1 supersymmetry is nonlinearly realized on the surviving
worldvolume elds. for the heterotic (type i) truncation these worldvolume elds are
given by the components of an abelian d = 10 vector multiplet (a single d = 10 majorana-
weyl fermion). the organization of this letter is as follows.
in section 1 we will rst
introduce a formulation of iib supergravity in the string frame that will be needed to
describe the super d9-brane action. a new feature is that we have added two 10forms
to the iib supergravity multiplet on which the iib supersymmetry algebra is realized.
there existence was already suggested in [12]. these 10forms, which are also employed
in [14], are needed to write down a gauge-invariant wesszumino (wz) term for the d9
brane (ns9b brane). we will give the z2 symmetries that lead to the heterotic and
type i truncation of the iib supergravity multiplet. for later use we also include the
at background truncation, which actually preserves an n = 2 global supersymmetry.
in section 2 we introduce the super d9brane and extend the z2 symmetries of the iib
supergravity background to the full super d9brane action. these z2 symmetries dene
the heterotic and type i truncations of the super d9brane that will be discussed in

5super dp-brane actions with simultaneous world-volume and space-time supersymmetry have been

constructed in [8].

6 only the type i truncation of d9 (as well as the heterotic truncation of ns9b) have a natural origin
in string theory. it would be interesting to see whether the heterotic truncation of d9 (and the type i
truncation of ns9b) also have a natural place in string theory.

section 3. finally, our conclusions can be found in section 4.

1 iib supergravity and its truncations

our starting point is the iib supergravity multiplet whose supersymmetry rules, in the
string frame, are given by7

where

the iib eld-strengths are dened in form language by [15]

h = 3db ,

g(2n+1) = dc (2n)  hc (2n2) .

these curvatures are invariant under the gauge transformations

7we ignore terms bilinear or higher order in the fermions.

(1.3)

b = d(n s) ,
c (2n) = d(2n1)

(rr)  (2n3)

(rr) h .

in component language the curvatures are given by

h = 3b ,

(1.4)

(1.5)

g(2n1) = (2n  1)(cid:8)c (2n2)  1

2(2n  2)(2n  3)bc (2n4)(cid:9) ,

where all indices (not shown explicitly) are assumed to be completely antisymmetrized with
weight one. the rr potentials c (2n2) are independent for n = 1, 2, 3. the potentials for
n = 4, 5 are related to those of n = 2, 1 via the relations

g(7)  g(3) , g(9)  g(1) ,
where g is the hodge dual. the curvature g(5) is selfdual.

(1.6)

note that we have introduced two 10forms b(10) and c (10). their 11-form curvatures
are identically zero and they do not describe any dynamical degree of freedom. they
are needed in order to write down a gauge-invariant and supersymmetric wz term in the
action of a super d9brane (ns9b brane).

note that iib supergravity is not invariant under a target-space parity transforma-
tion, which takes the selfdual, chiral iib supergravity into the anti-selfdual anti-chiral
iib supergravity. under target-space parity transformations, only c (0), c (2) and c (4) are
pseudotensors and get an extra minus sign while the remaining rr potentials, which are
dened via hodge duality, are tensors and do not get any extra signs.

the iib supersymmetry rules (1.1) realize the following iib supersymmetry algebra

(bosonic symmetries only)

[(1), (2)] = gct(a) + ((rr)) + ((n s)),

(1.7)

where the transformation parameters on the right-hand side are given by

a = 21 ,

(2n1)
(rr) 1...2n1 = ac (2n)

1...2n1 + e2pn1...2n11
(2n  1)c (2n2)

[1...2n2

232n1]1 ,

(1.8)

((n s)) = ab  231 ,

((n s))1...9 = ab1...9  231...91 .

note that on the ten-form potentials the general coordinate transformation cancels against
a eld-dependent gauge transformation.

there are ve z2 symmetries of the iib supermultiplet 8. the rst two are called 3

symmetries and are given by

f  3f ,

c (2n2)  c (2n2) ,

n ,

(1.9)




where f stands for any fermion doublet. the next two z2 symmetries are called 1
symmetries and read:

f  1f ,

c (2n2)  (1)nc (2n2) ,




b  b ,
b(10)  b(10) .

(1.10)




finally, the fth discrete symmetry is just the z2 grading of the n = 2b superspace which
reverses the sign of all fermions. it is associated to a truncation from n = 2b to n = 0
supersymmetry in which only the bosonic elds remain. we will not discuss this grading
any further.

the z2 symmetries lead to truncations that are dened by setting to zero all elds
that change sign under the corresponding z2. the surviving supersymmetry is determined
by the requirement that the elds that have been set equal to zero remain zero under
supersymmetry. this leads to two possibilities. the rst is, in both the 3 and the
1 cases, to keep local n = 1 supersymmetry. the second possibility is to keep two
global supersymmetries, but to set more elds than those that change sign under the z2
transformation, equal to zero. in fact, in this last case only a at zehnbein remains and

8these symmetries correspond to involutions of the iib superalgebra [16].

5

supersymmetry is realized in a trivial way. nevertheless, this at case is relevant later
when the iib multiplet appears as a background for the d9-brane.

the truncations with local n = 1 supersymmetry will be referred to as the heterotic
truncations (3), and the type i truncations (1). we summarize the truncations
below.

flat background truncation:

e

a = 

a ,

(all other elds zero) .

(1.11)

there are two unbroken supersymmetries with constant parameter . note that for sim-
plicity we have set the dilaton  equal to zero.

heterotic truncations:

c (2n2) = 0 ,

n = 1, . . . , 6 ,

(1  3)f = 0 .




the transformation rules of the resulting n = 1 heterotic supergravity theory are:

e

a = a ,

8 6h ,

 = d  1
b = 2[] ,
1...10 = [1...910] ,
12 6h(cid:1)  ,

 = (cid:0)6   1

 = 1

2  .

b(10)

(1.12)

(1.13)

the unbroken supersymmetry parameter satises  = 3.
these two multiplets are associated to the eective eld theory of the heterotic string
based on righthanded and lefthanded worldsheet elds, respectively. they are related
by the duality transformation b  b, b(10)  b(10). we observe that in the heterotic
frame h occurs as torsion, i.e., it can be combined with the spin-connection in d. as
in the iib supergravity theory, the heterotic supergravity multiplet is not invariant under
targetspace parity transformations which interchange the chirality of spinors.

6

type i truncations:




the transformation rules are:

c (2n2) = 0 ,

n = 1, 3, 5 ,

b(10) = 0 ,
(1  1)f = 0 .

a = a ,

23! e 6 g(3)(cid:1)  ,

 = 1

2  ,

(1.14)

(1.15)

where the unbroken supersymmetry parameter satises  = 1.

these two n = 1 supergravity multiplets are associated to the eective eld theories
of type i strings. observe that in the type i frame g(3) = 3c (2) does not occur as
torsion. these two n = 1 theories are related by the duality transformation c (2)  c (2),
c (10)  c (10).

2 the super d9brane

in this section we introduce the action for the super d9brane in curved iib superspace.
using the notation of ref. [5], the worldvolume elds are the supercoordinates and the
born-infeld vector

{z m , vi} ,

z m = (x,  i) ,

(2.1)

where  = 0, . . . , 9, i = 0, . . . , 9,  = 1, . . . , 32, i = 1, 2 and the string-frame background

where we have set the d9-tension equal to one. the tensor f is given by

bij = iz m jz nbn m .

note that the supereld b(10) does not occur in the action (2.3).
the super d9brane action (2.3) has the following symmetries:

(2.13)

(2.14)

note that -symmetry requires that the iib supergravity elds satisfy their equations

of motion. this does not lead to any restriction on c (10) 9.

target-space super-reparametrizations:

all superspace elds transform as supertensors under the super-reparametrization (in-

cluding general coordinate transformations)

kz m = k m (z) ,
kvi = i ,

(2.15)




9observe that c(10) is a background eld. we are not supposed to take the equation of motion that
follows from varying c(10) in the super d9brane action. clearly this equation of motion would be
inconsistent.

9

where i is dened through the supersymmetry transformation of bij

in a at background we have

kbij = 2[ij] .

k  = a  1

2  ,

k i =  i .

z2 transformations:

(2.16)

(2.17)

all z2 symmetries of the iib supergravity background discussed in the previous section

can be extended to the full super d9brane action as follows:

1. 3  symmetries: the 3symmetry must be supplemented by

  3 ,

(2.18)

and by a worldvolume parity transformation d9. we would like to stress the fact
that  does not change parity under worldvolume parity transformations because it
is a worldvolume (anticommuting scalar and a target-space spinor.

note that the action of the z2 symmetry on the pulled-back superelds is in form
the same as the action (1.9) on the component background elds.

2. 1  symmetries: the action (1.10) on the background elds must be supplemented

by the following action on the worldvolume elds:

  1 ,
v  v .

(2.19)




again, the action of the pulled-back superelds is in form the same as the action
(1.10) on the component background elds.

3 truncations of the super d9brane action

in the previous section we have seen that the z2 symmetries of the iib background can
be extended to z2 symmetries of the full super d9brane action. in this section we will
discuss the corresponding truncations. in particular, we will investigate what happens with

10

the fermionic symmetries (-symmetry and target-space super-reparametrizations) in each
case.

for the explicit results (action and transformation rules) we will limit ourselves to a at
background. this will lead to two dierent n = 1 globally supersymmetric eld theories.
our calculations ensure that these can be extended to the full n = 1 local supersymmetry.
to compare we have also included the at background truncation which leads to an n = 2
global supersymmetry.

3.1 flat background truncation

this case has been discussed in [7]. the at background truncation is dened by

e

a = 

a ,

(all other background elds zero) .

(3.1)

the (bosonic and fermionic) embedding coordinates remain nonzero. there are two
unbroken supersymmetries with constant parameter . in the appendix we have given the
expansion of the superelds (up to terms linear in ) corresponding to at iib superspace.

the born-infeld part of the action (2.4) takes the form

where

l = q|mij| ,

(3.2)

mij = ij + f (v )ij + (ij) + 3[ij] + 1
4

ai aj + 1
4

3a[i aj] .

(3.3)

the wess-zumino term (2.5) retains its form, but now with at background rr superelds.

the symmetry transformations are:

11

  =  + (1 + ) + ji  ,
x = 1

2  + 1

2 (1 + ) + iix ,

24 (3a ai + a 3ai)

8 (1 + )a a3

vi =  1
2 3ix  1
 1
2 (1 + )3ix  1
8 (1 + )a3 a
 1
+jjvi + (ij)vj .

(3.4)

note that the at background truncation preserves the -transformations. at this
stage these -transformations can be gauge-xed as described in [7]. we will see that the
heterotic and type i truncation correspond, in a at background, to truncations of (3.2)
and (3.4) in which the -transformations are automatically eliminated. these truncations
are described below.

3.2 heterotic truncation

the heterotic truncation is dened by the discrete symmetry of the d9-brane generated
by 3:

c (2n2) = (1  3)f = 0 ,

n = 1, . . . , 6 .

(3.5)

the n = 1 heterotic superspace is dened by the truncation

the action after truncation is given by

(1  3) = 0 .

sheterotic = zm 10

d10eq|gij + fij| ,

(3.6)

(3.7)

where it is understood that all superelds are n = 1 heterotic, i.e., 3truncated iib
superelds. on-shell they describe the heterotic supergravity multiplet (1.13). the wess-
zumino term vanishes in this truncation.

12

we now take a at background and choose the sign for the 3 truncation such that
2 = 0 10. then the truncation of the iib background elds implies that 2 = 0. the
remaining symmetry parameters have to be constrained by the condition 2 = 0, which
means that 2 + 1 = 0. this implies that (1 + ) vanishes. at this stage it is convenient
to go to the static gauge, i.e., to choose x = 
i i. this requires a compensating world-
volume reparametrization with parameter

 =  1

2 11 .

(3.8)

the result of this truncation in a at background is given by an action of the form

(3.2), now with

m =  + f (v ) +  + 1

4 a a ,

(3.9)

where we have set   1. this action is invariant under the supersymmetry transforma-
tions (  1)

  =  +   ,
2   1
v =  1

12 a a + v + ()v ,

(3.10)

with  given by (3.8).

note that the heterotic z2 also involves a world volume parity transformation d9. this
acts only on the wess-zumino term, and in the form of  (see the -transformation rules).
however, the truncation sets the wess-zumino term equal to zero, and eliminates the -
transformations, as we have seen above. therefore the world volume parity transformation
becomes irrelevant. this is important in going to the static gauge, which turns the d9-
theory into an ordinary d = 10 eld theory. before truncation the static gauge would have
been inconsistent with d9, since this gauge choice identies d9 with the target space
parity transformation, which is not a symmetry of the iib multiplet. therefore taking the
static gauge before truncation would break the z2 symmetry of the d9-brane, while after
truncation there is no problem.

the heterotic truncation implies that a locally (nonlinear) supersymmetric extension
of the d = 10 maxwell theory exists which contains a cosmological constant. as far as we
know the existence of such an n = 1 supersymmetrization has not been noted before in
the literature.

10 the other sign leads to the same result with 1 = 0.

13

3.3 type i truncation

the type i truncation is associated to the discrete symmetry of the d9-brane generated
by 1:

b = c (2n2) = (1  1)f = vi = 0 ,

n = 1, 3, 5 .

(3.11)

the type i superspace is dened by the truncation

the action after truncation is given by

(1  1) = 0 .

stype i = zm 10

d10(cid:26)eq|gij| + c (10)(cid:27) .

(3.12)

(3.13)

it is understood that all superelds are n = 1 type i, i.e., 1truncated iib superelds.
on-shell they describe the type i supergravity multiplet (1.15).

we now consider a at background. note that in this truncation we have set vi = 011.
this simplies the -transformations considerably, since now  = 1  (0). in particular,
in the at background which we will consider below (0) = 11. therefore

(1 + )  (cid:18) 1 1

1 (cid:19) .

1

(3.14)

let us choose the truncation 1  2 = 0 12, and set  = 1/2. the truncation of
the iib background requires also  = 1/2 = 2/2. the remaining supersymmetry
transformations are, in the static gauge and in a at background

  =  +   ,

(3.15)

with  as in (3.8). this leaves invariant the action (3.13), with  = 0 and

11 the elimination of the bi vector is natural from the string theory point of view where orientifolding
the type iib superstring with  changes the chan-paton factors from u(n) to so(n). in our case, for a
single d9, we have n = 1 and hence no bi vector eld. we thank b. schellekens for pointing this out to
us.

12the other truncation, 1 + 2 = 0, leads to a surviving kappa-symmetry. the action, however, in this

truncation becomes zero (see below).

14

gij  g =  +  + 1

4 a a .

(3.16)

this action is the volkov-akulov action [17] generalized to ten dimensions13.

we observe that the wess-zumino term in the original d9-brane action is separately
invariant under supersymmetry transformations: only -invariance, which in this trunca-
tion disappears, requires a collaboration of the born-infeld and the wess-zumino term.
therefore the born-infeld and the wess-zumino term should be separately invariant under
the transformation (3.15). the existence of two volkov-akulov invariants appears unlikely,
and indeed, a closer look at the expansion in  shows that, in a at background, they are
equal up to an additive constant14:

q|g| q|| = c (10) .

(3.17)

thus the wess-zumino term, expressed in c (10) only, provides an interesting reformula-
tion of the volkov-akulov action. this wess-zumino construction of a volkov-akulov the-
ory can be done in any dimension which allows spacetime lling d-branes, i.e., d = 3, 4, 6
and 10.

4 conclusions

in this letter we have discussed two inequivalent truncations of the super d9-brane. only
one of them, the type i truncation, has a natural string theory origin. it is the truncation
that is triggered by the worldsheet parity operator  of the fundamental string. we only
considered the truncation of a single super d9-brane and this leads to a d = 10 volkov-
akulov action in terms of a single majorana-weyl fermion.

as a by-product we found the following interesting reformulation of the n = 1, d = 10

volkov-akulov action15:

svolkovakulov = zm 10

d10x c (10) ,

(4.1)

13the occurrence of a volkov-akulov action, after truncation of the bi vector was also mentioned in [18].
volkov-akulov actions also occur in truncated and gauge-xed versions of non-spacetime-lling branes [19].
14note that in the other truncation, 1 + 2 = 0, c(10)  c(10) and the kinetic and wz term cancel
15 similar results hold in any spacetime dimension in which spacetime-lling d-branes exist, i.e., d=

against each other.

3,4,6, and 10.

where c (10) is the pull-back of a 10-form supereld in the type i truncated at superspace.
its 11-form curvature g(11) = dc (10) has non-zero components given by

g(11)

ij a1an = i

2 (a1an(1 + 11)) (1)ij .

(4.2)

such superelds have explored in the past [20] and here we nd a nice application of them.

it would be interesting to extend our work to the non-abelian case and make contact
with the supersymmetric low-energy eective action of the type i so(32) superstring.
the (truncated version of the) worldvolume action of 32 coincident d9-branes should be
supplemented with a contribution from a single orientifold o9-plane to give the type i
eective action:

s32 d9 + so9 = sio32 .

(4.3)

some of the coupling terms in so9 have been calculated [21], for more recent results,
see [22]. apart from this we need to nd a kappa-symmetric non-abelian generalization of
the super d9 brane action. it would be very interesting to nd such a generalization.

a expansion of at superelds

in this appendix we collect the value of the relevant superelds in a at background.

the target-space super-reparametrization parameter k m is determined by

16

k i =  i .

(a.1)

the supervielbein em

k  = a  1
a takes on the form

2  ,

e

a = 

a ,

e i

2 (cid:0)a(cid:1) i ,

a =  1
j =  i

e

i = 0 ,

e i

j .

(a.2)

the superelds b and c (2n2) are more complicated. for our purposes we only need the
terms linear in  which are given by

b i =  1
1...2n3 i = 1

2 (cid:0)3(cid:1) i .
2 (cid:0)pn1...2n3(cid:1) i .
