abstract

non-trivial responses of the phase of the wave function of a quantum system
under the action of dieomorphisms on the corresponding phase space, lead to
the appearance of new uncertainty relations and to a quantum generation of
extra degrees of freedom with regard to the classical counterpart. in particular,
symmetries of the hall eect, yang-mills and conformally invariant classical eld
theories are aected when passing to the quantum realm.

1 introduction

the importance of phase invariance in quantum mechanics and its physical implications
has been widely discussed in the study of, for example, geometric phases (see [1] for a
collection of papers). fundamental mathematical structures and objects like bre bundles
and holonomies, and important physical concepts like berrys phase, are directly attached
to this relevant invariance of quantum phenomena. also, the quantization of some phys-
ical magnitudes and the stability of some topological quantum numbers can be directly
attributed to the cyclic (compact) character of the quantum mechanical phase  = ei.

however, despite the relevance of phase invariance, the standard (canonical) approach
to quantum theory does not stress enough its central role in the quantization proce-
dure. concepts like anomaly or no-go theorem, which usually make reference to failures
associated with the quantization of a classical system, have been serious obstacles for

work partially supported by the dgicyt.

the traditional quantization methods, even though they sometimes prove to be essen-
tial ingredients of the corresponding quantum system. anomalies, for example, which
manifest themselves through the appearance of central terms at the right-hand side of
some commutators, which their classical counterpart (poisson bracket) does not possess,
prove to have an important physical meaning in connection with the the spontaneous
breakdown of some underlying symmetry. this central term contribution traces back to a
non-trivial transformation of the phase of the wave function under the consecutive action
of two dierent symmetry operations which, nevertheless, leave the corresponding classi-
cal equations of motion unchanged (see below in connection with the breakdown in the
unitary implementation of the conformal symmetry for massless elds).

all of these failures in quantization should disappear if one gives up the idea of quan-
tizing classical systems. also, any reasonable attempt to reconcile gravity with quantum
mechanics should pass through an inherently quantum approach to the formulation of the
quantum theory of the gravitational eld. suitable candidates for an intrinsic formu-
lation of quantum mechanics (without any reference to an underlying classical system)
should incorporate tools and concepts of algebra, geometry and topology to take into
account both local and global aspects of quantum theory. in fact, physical systems pos-
sessing a gauge symmetry share and exhibit a principal bundle internal structure where
the phase invariance plays a central role in, for example, determining the structure
of constraints (rst- and/or second-class). symmetry is another essential component of
quantum mechanics; after all, any consistent (non-perturbative) quantization is mostly a
unitary irreducible representation of a suitable (lie, poisson) algebra. all these previous
requirements advocate a group structure as a rm candidate to dene a quantum system.
central extensions g of a group g by u(1) (the group of phase invariance) have a natural
bre bundle structure g  g/u(1), where u(1) is the structure subgroup of g [2]. other
brations g  g/ t of g by t  t  u(1) correspond to a constrained quantum system
[3] with gauge group t and, as already mentioned, the structure of t (as a central
extension of t by u(1)) determines the nature of constraints: rst- and/or second-class
(see later). the group law g = g  g for g can be written in general form as:

g = (g; ) = (g  g; e

i
h

(g,g)), g, g, g  g; , ,   u(1),

where  : g  g   is a two-cocycle, which veries the general property:

(g2, g1) + (g2  g1, g3) = (g2, g1  g3) + (g1, g3) , gi  g ,

(1)

(2)

and the constant h (namely, the planck constant) is intended to kill any possible dimension
of  (namely, action dimension).
in the general theory of central extensions [4], two-
cocycles are said to be equivalent if they dier by a coboundary, i.e. a two-cocycle which
can be written in the form (g, g) = (g  g)  (g)  (g), where (g) is called the
generating function of the coboundary (from now on we shall omit the prex two when
referring to two-cocycles). however, although cocycles diering by a coboundary lead
to equivalent central extensions as such, there are some coboundaries which provide a

on the bre bundle g and lie-algebra structure constants dierent from those of the di-
rect product g  u(1). these are generated by a function  with a non-trivial gradient
at the identity d(g)|g=e = (g)
dgj 6= 0, and can be divided into pseudo-cohomology
equivalence subclasses: two pseudo-cocycles are equivalent if they dier by a coboundary
generated by a function with trivial gradient at the identity [5, 6, 7]. pseudo-cohomology
plays an important role in the theory of nite-dimensional semi-simple groups, as they
have trivial cohomology. for them, pseudo-cohomology classes are associated with coad-
joint orbits [7]. we shall have the opportunity of showing how, in fact, the introduction
of coboundaries in some physical systems alters the corresponding quantum theory.

wave functions  are dened in this group-framework as complex functions on g,

 : g  c, which verify the t -equivariance condition

lgt(g)  (gt  g) = d()

t (gt)(g) , gt  t , g  g ,

where d()
symbolizes a specic representation d of t with -index (in particular, the
t
 = -angle [8] of non-abelian gauge theories; see below) and generalizes the typical phase
invariance of quantum mechanics, d()
t () = ,   u(1)  t , when extra constraints
are considered in the theory. the left-action

lg(g)  (g  g), g, g  g

(5)

denes a reducible (in general) representation of g on the linear space of t -equivariant
wave functions (4). the reduction is achieved by means of those right restrictions on wave
functions

d()
t () = ; the right restrictions (6) generalize the notion of polarization conditions of
geometric quantization (see [2] and references therein), the schrodinger equation be-
ing a particular case of polarization condition in the group approach to quantization
(gaq) framework [2]. the subgroup gp is called the polarization subgroup (see [9, 7] for
anomalous cases) and contains non-symplectic (without dynamical content) coordinates
like time, rotations, etc, and half of the symplectic ones (either positions or momenta).
the characteristic subalgebra gc of left-invariant vector elds (l.i.v.f.)
related to non-
symplectic coordinates admits an algebraic characterization as follows:

gc = ker  kerd = {l.i.v.f. x / ( x) = 0, d( x) = 0} .

the representation (5) is also unitary with respect to the scalar product

let us work out a simple, although general, example of a quantizing group g which
eventually applies to a diversity of physical systems, for example, the quantum hall eect
and quantum yang-mills theories.

2 generalized conformal symmetry and extended

objects from the free particle

the simplest quantum commutation relations are given by the heisemberg-weyl commu-
tators:

[qj, pk] = ihjk i

(11)
which means that, after successive translations q and p of the position q and the mo-
jqj ) which
mentum p, the wave function gains a non-trivial phase factor  = e
can be read from the heisemberg-weyl group law:

trix. this is the simplest example where all the operators have a canonically-conjugated
counterpart. the addition of quadratic polynomials

sp(2d, ) = { qjk  qj qk, pjk  pj pk, rjk  qj pk}

(13)

(more precisely, the generators of the symplectic group sp(2d, ) = {s  m2d2d/ stw s =
w }) yields the weyl-symplectic group w sp(2d, ), whose group law is

s = ss ,
~v  = ~v  + s ~v ,

the unitary irreducible representations of the group w sp(2d, ) describe a quantum
free-like dynamics (galilean particle, harmonic oscillator, etc) when the structure group
is just t = u(1). other choices of t lead to constrained (non-linear, in general) quantum
dynamics on a submanifold  of the phase space 2d; for example, the ane struc-
2
2 (~q~p + ~p~q), i}, leads to a
ture subgroup t = a(1), which is generated by {~q
particle moving on the sd1 sphere of radius r. nevertheless, in comparison with the
heisenberg-weyl group, the weyl-symplectic group, as such, does not incorporate new
degrees of freedom into the theory unless extra central extensions are considered. for
example, the appearance of internal degrees of freedom manifests itself through a non-
trivial transformation  s 
h cob(s ,s) of the phase under the action of the symplectic
group sp(2n, )  w sp(2n, ) (note that this possibility is not realised in the group
law (14)), where cob(s, s) = (ss)  (s)  (s) is a (pseudo) cocycle generated by
the linear function (s) = jkqjk + jkpjk + jkrjk in the coordinates qjk, pjk, rjk of the
symplectic group (attached to the lie-algebra generators (13)) and jk, jk, jk are real
parameters. when the cocycle (in fact, coboundary) cob(s, s) is added to the cocycle

(15)

it induces the appearance of central charges in the lie-algebra commutators of sp(2d, ).
for example, a non-trivial response of the phase under rotations su(2)  sp(6, ), given
by the generating function (s) = 12(r12  r21), deforms the lie-algebra of angular
momentum operators li = ijk rjk and leads to the appearance of central terms

h l1, l2i = ih l3 + 12h i

(16)

proportional to the spin parameter s = 12/h. thus, the couple { l1, l2} becomes a
canonically-conjugated pair of variables, on an equal footing with {qj, pj}; in fact, the
operators lj are no longer written in terms of the basic operators qj, pk, since they,
themselves, are now basic (spin operators) and represent a new degree of freedom of the
quantum theory given by a unitary irreducible representation of the deformed weyl-
symplectic group (the one which incorporates cob). a similar argument applies for non-
trivial responses of the phase under the action of the sl(2, )  sp(2d, ) subgroup, given
j=1 rjj, which deforms the lie-algebra of squeezing

proportional to the symplin (symplectic spin) parameter s = /h [10]. the symplin degree
of freedom shares with spin its internal character, although it possesses an innite number
of internal states which correspond to the carrier space of the irreducible representations of
the non-compact group sl(2, ) with bargmann index k = s. unlike spin, whose physical
signicance is well understood in terms of fermionic and bosonic objects, symplin does

critical value of s0 = d/2 (for which an anomalous reduction of the representation is
possible [10]) seems to have a direct physical meaning related to the zero point energy
e0 = s0h of a d-dimensional harmonic oscillator (observable, for example, in the casimir
eect [11]). this particular value of s0 = d/2 tells us that the quantization map 
assigns the operator r  ihs0 i = 1
j=1(qj pj + pj qj) (actually, the symmetrized operator)
j=1 qjpj. this anomalous reduction for the critical value of
s0 = d/2, which allows the operator r to be written in terms of the basic operators q and
p, is of the same nature as the anomalous reduction which allows the virasoro operators
lk to be written in terms of the string modes

(19)

as is well known from the no-go theorems of groenwald and van hove [13, 14, 15],
the standard canonical quantization fails to go beyond any poisson algebra containing
polynomials in q and p of degree greater than two. ambiguities in quantization arise
mainly due to ordering problems; for example, the quantization mapping  is not
unique for the classical function q2p2. from the point of view of group quantization, the
quantum morphism  can be distorted because of the appearance of inescapable terms
(central ones, in particular) in the quantum lie-algebra commutators, whose classical
counterpart (poisson algebra brackets) do not possess. in fact, let us choose the next set
of classical functions of the harmonic oscillator variables a = 12(q + ip), a = 12(q  ip)
(we are using m = 1 = , for simplicity):

(21)

which formally generalizes the poisson algebra w of functions on a two-dimensional phase
space [16] (to half-integer indices). the (conformal-spin-2) generators ln  l0

virasoro algebra (19) without central extension, and the (conformal-spin-1) generators

if the analyticity of the classical functions l

n is taken into account, then one should
worry about a restriction of the range of the indices n, . the subalgebra of polynomial
functions w  {l

corresponds to the classical limit h  0 of the so-called wedge subalgebra w [17]
(isomorphic to sl(, ) algebra), which is a particular case ( (0)) of sl(2, ) tensor-
operator algebras denoted collectively by  () [the quotient of the enveloping algebra
u(sl(2, )) by the ideal generated by q  , where q is the casimir of sl(2, ) and  is
related to the symplin s by  = s

of w, and their essence can be captured in a classical construction by extending the
poisson bracket {, } to the moyal bracket {, }m [18] of functions on the co-adjoint orbits
of sl(2, ) (the wedge algebra w corresponds to the case where the co-adjoint orbit is
a cone +  s1). for the critical value of the symplin s0 = 1
2, the algebra  ( =  3
16 )
is the symplecton algebra of biedenharn and louck (see [17] and references therein),
and the limit    corresponds to the area-preserving dieomorphisms sdif f (h) of
a two-dimensional hyperboloid h.

quantum deformations (22) of w do not introduce true central extensions (the situa-
tion changes when half-integer values of the indices are allowed). the inclusion of central
terms in (22) requires the formal extension w() of  () beyond the wedge |n|   + 1
[17], that is, the consideration of non-polynomial functions (20). if we use polar coor-
n = r2(1+)e2in, which are
dinates a = rei, then the functions (20) acquire the form l
single-valued for all values of , n  z/2 with the condition   1 (strictly positive
conformal-spin). central terms of the form h2c(n; ),n+m,0 i are known for the par-
ticular cases: w  w(0) and w1+  w( 1
4). it is also precisely for these specic
values of  that the sequence of terms on the right-hand side of (22) turns out to be zero
whenever + 2j  0 and + 2j  1 respectively, and therefore w (resp. w1+)
can be consistently truncated to a closed algebra containing only those generators with
conformal-spins  2 (resp.  1). the aforementioned central term provides extensions for
all (positive) conformal-spin currents, in particular the standard central extension (19)
for the virasoro sector, and the central extension [n, m] = ncn+m,0 for the abelian
kac-moody subalgebra of conformal-spin-1 string modes, when  =  1

4 (see [17]).

the algebras w and w1+ generalize the underlying virasoro gauged symmetry of
the light-cone two-dimensional induced gravity discovered by polyakov [19], and induced
actions for these w-gravity theories have been proposed in [20]. for them, the quantization
procedure deforms w to w symmetry due to the presence of anomalies. also, hidden
sl(, ) and gl(, ) kac-moody symmetries exist for w and w1+ gravity (see
[21] and [22] for a review), respectively, generalizing the hidden sl(2, ) kac-moody
symmetry of polyakovs induced gravity [23].

7

thus, w() theories for the critical values  = 0 and  =  1

4 are fairly well
understood (also induced w gravity has being obtained as a wznw model [24]). in
contrast, gauge theories of w()-algebras, for general , are said to be less interesting
because they include, in general, negative conformal-spins i =  + 2  0. however, the
consideration of negative conformal-spins provide new central extensions which, as far as
we know, have not been considered in the literature. in fact, in addition to the virasoro-
12(n3  n),0,0n+m,0 i, which is the only possible central extension
sector central term c
of (21) as such for positive conformal-spins i  0 (see [17]), extra central extensions

indeed, the generator l1

0
(the quantum counterpart of the the classical constant function l1
2) commutes with
all the other generators and plays the role of the central generator i. classical functions
n with negative conformal-spins  < 1 are singular at the origin aa = 0. now, from
l
a quantum point of view, each operator l
n with  < 1 has a canonically-conjugated
counterpart l1
(related to a non-singular classical function) and no longer needs to
2 a and l 1
be written in terms of other eectively basic operators such as l 1
2 a,
 1
thus avoiding problems of lack of analyticity. even more, the operator l0
0 associated with
the classical function l0
2aa is never zero because of the existence of a zero point
energy (critical value of the symplin degree of freedom) associated with the inherent
ordering ambiguity; also, square roots of aa are a minor harm from the quantum point
of view.

in other words, the removal of the origin from the original symplectic manifold creates
new cohomology, i.e. new couples of canonically-conjugated generators (in fact, an innite
amount) emerge when the topology of the phase-space turns less trivial (2  +  s1)
and, as a result, new quantum extended objects possessing conformal symmetry appear.
the eld content of these extended objects and the possible deformations (renormaliza-
tions) caused by the quantization procedure are being investigated from a gaq framework
[25]. an explicit expression for the corresponding invariant action functional s can be

given from the integral s = r  of the one-form  in (3), which generalizes the poincare-

cartan form p c of classical mechanics for the quantum phase term ih1d, along the
in the characteristic subalgebra (7). this way of constructing
trajectories of the l.i.v.f.
eld models from two-cocycles (see ref.
[26]) diers from the analysis in related works
based on the coadjoint-orbit approach [13, 14, 27, 28]. also, the study of tensor-operator
algebras of more general semi-simple groups, their precise relation with the poisson alge-
bra of functions on the corresponding co-adjoint orbits and the physical meaning of its
extensions beyond the wedge is in progress.

let us see how w1+ symmetry also arises in a two-dimensional electron gas in a
perpendicular magnetic eld, and its relevance in the classication of all the universality
classes of incompressible quantum uids and the identication of the quantum numbers
of the excitations in the quantum hall eect (qhe).

8

3 quantum hall universality classes and w1+ sym-

metry

, j = 1, 2 (c = eh

qhe can be considered the paradigm of the two-dimensional quantum physical sys-
tems. the extreme precision of the rational values of the hall conductivity x1x2 (in
e2/h units) suggests that the dynamics of planar electrons in a perpendicular mag-
netic eld h is constrained by symmetry and topology. in fact, magnetic translations
xj = jkqk + pj
mc denotes the cyclotron frequency), which are stan-
mc
dard space translations combined with gauge transformations, are the most important
underlying symmetry of this system. the commutator of two innitesimal magnetic
h jk i, which reproduces the heisemberg-weyl commutation
translations is [ xj, xk] = i mc
relations given in (11). this symmetry is responsible for the innite degeneracy of the
landau levels, degeneracy that becomes nite when boundary conditions (for example,
periodicity conditions) are imposed. this constrained symmetry can be described by
means of the heisemberg-weyl group g (12) in d = 1, that is:

xj = xj + xj,  = ei mc

2h (x

1x2x1x

2) ,

(24)

where nite translations xj  xj + kjlj by an integer amount of lj (spatial period) play
the role of the structure subgroup t  z  z  u(1)  g (see [29] for more details). one
can easily check from the last group law that, for integer values of  = mcl1l2
2h = n, the
structure subgroup t is abelian (i.e. t is a trivial central extension t = z  z  u(1)),
so that all the constraints are rst-class, and the unitary irreducible representations of g
are n-dimensional (in contrast with the innite-dimensional character of the t = u(1)
case). the condition  = n represents a quantization of the magnetic ux through the
torus surface (the quotient   /z  z) in the same manner as in the dirac monopole
case. nevertheless, this quantization condition is not strictly necessary and fractional
values of the ux  = n
r are also allowed (the irrational case is more involved and requires
techniques from non-commutative geometry [30]). the structure subgroup t is non-
abelian for this case (it is a non-trivial central extension), so that constraints are second-
class, and the unitary irreducible representations of g are n  r-dimensional (spinorial-
like representations).

there is a reciprocal relation between the ux  and the lling factor  = hx1x2/e2,
which is a very stable (topological) number that appears with odd denominators for
fermionic carrying systems (perhaps modular invariance could explain this odd denomi-
nator rule [31]). very accurate trial wave functions were proposed by laughlin ([32] for
a review) to describe the behavior of the ground state for dierent values of . these
are macroscopic quantum states with uniform density and a gap for density uctuations,
which lead to the key idea of two-dimensional incompressible quantum uids, and can be
classically thought of as droplets of liquid without density waves. thus, at the classical
level, all possible congurations of droplets of incompressible uid (edge excitations) can
be generated by area-preserving dieomorphisms from a reference droplet, that is, by ap-
plying generators of w1+ on the ground-state distribution function . this dynamical

9

symmetry, which has been identied by [33], traces back to the extra canonical transfor-
mations of the four-dimensional phase space that leave invariant the hamiltonian; that
is, functions like (20) of magnetic translations a = 1

2 (x2 + ix1).

the quantization of these edge excitations can be achieved by studying the irreducible,
unitary highest-weight representations of w1+ (a complete classication has been given
in [34]), which correspond to (1 + 1)-dimensional eective conformal eld theories.
in
this formalism, the incompressible quantum uid ground state |i appears as a highest-
weight state satisfying l
n|i = 0, n  0,   1. particle-hole edge excitations
above the ground state are obtained by applying generators with negative mode index,
l
, to |i. these highest-weight conditions are automatically fullled from the gaq
point of view.
indeed, according to general settings [3, 35] the vacuum of a quantum
theory dened through a quantizing group g must be annihilated by the right-version
of the polarization subalgebra dual to gp in (6). for the case of the quantizing algebra
g = w1+, the characteristic subalgebra (7) is gc = { x 
0 ,   1} ( x means the left-
invariant vector eld counterpart of l), which can be enlarged to a polarization subalgebra
n ,   1, n < 0}. the polarization conditions (6) x = 0, x  gp reduce the
gp = { x 
representation (5) of g on u(1)-equivariant wave functions (4).

|n|

the point is that one can presumably characterize any quantum incompressible uid as
a w1+ theory, so that the hierarchy problem (that is, the classication of stable ground
states and their excitations corresponding to all observed plateaus or lling fractions)
reduces to a complete classication of w1+ theories (see [33] for more details).

the general idea that central extensions of the symmetry group of a physical system
provide new (quantum) degrees of freedom is also applicable to the appearance of mass
in yang-mills quantum theories, as we are going to see now.

4 group quantization of yang-mills theories: a co-

homological origin of mass

some of the essential issues we have discussed in sec. 2 about the irreducible repre-
sentations of w sp(2d, ) bearing internal degrees of freedom, will be useful in showing
how mass can enter yang-mills theories through central (pseudo) extensions of the cor-
responding gauge group. this mechanism does not involve extra (higgs) scalar particles
and could provide new clues for the better understanding of the nature of the symmetry
breaking mechanism. we are going to outline the essential points and refer the interested
reader to refs. [36, 37] for further information.

b a

let us denote by a(x) = ra

a(x)t b,  = 0, ..., 3; a, b = 1, ..., n the lie-algebra valued
vector potential attached to a non-abelian gauge group which, for simplicity, we suppose
to be unitary, say t = map(4, su(n)) = {u(x) = exp a(x)t a}, where ta are the
generators of su(n), which satisfy the commutation relations [ta, tb] = c c
abtc, and the
coupling constant matrix ra
b . we shall also
make partial use of the gauge freedom to set the temporal component a0 = 0, so that
a(x)t b =  aj(x). in this case,
the lie-algebra valued electric eld is simply ej(x)  ra

b reduces to a multiple of the identity ra

b = ra

there is still a residual gauge invariance t = map(3, su(n)) (see [38]).

the proposed (innite dimensional) quantizing group for quantum yang-mills theories
will be a central extension g of g = (ga ge)s t (semi-direct product of the cotangent
group of the abelian group of lie-algebra valued vector potentials and the non-abelian
gauge group t ) by u(1). more precisely, the group law for g, g = g  g, with g =
(aj

a(y), u(z); ), can be explicitly written as (in natural units h = 1 = c):

a(x), ej

u(x) = u(x)u(x) ,
~a(x) = ~a(x) + u(x) ~a(x)u(x)1 ,
~e(x) = ~e(x) + u(x) ~e(x)u(x)1 ,

1 0 ! is a symplectic matrix and we have split up the cocycle  into

1

two distinguishable and typical cocycles j, j = 1, 2. the rst cocycle 1 is meant to
provide dynamics for the vector potential, so that the couple (a, e) corresponds to a
canonically-conjugate pair of coordinates. the second cocycle 2, the mixed cocycle, pro-
vides a non-trivial (non-diagonal) action of the structure subgroup t on vector potentials
and determines the number of degrees of freedom of the constrained theory; in fact, it rep-
resents the quantum counterpart of the classical inhomogeneous term u(x)u(x)1
we miss at the right-hand side of the gauge transformation of ~a (second line of (25)),
that is, the vector potential ~a has to transform homogeneously under the action of the
gauge group t in order to dene a proper group law, whereas the inhomogeneous term
u(x)u(x)1 modies the phase  of the wave function according to 2 (see [37, 36] for
a covariant form of this quantum transformation).

to make more explicit the intrinsic signicance of these two quantities j , j = 1, 2, let
us calculate the non-trivial lie-algebra commutators of the right-invariant vector elds
(that is, the generators of the left-action lg(g) = g  g of g on itself) from the group law
(25). they are explicitly:

h aj
a(x), ek
h aj
a(x), b(y)i = ic c
h ej
a(x), b(y)i = ic c

b (y)i = iabjk(x  y) i ,
ab(x  y) aj
ab(x  y) ej
c (x)
ab(x  y) c(x) ,

[ a(x), b(y)] = ic c

(26)

which agree with those of ref. [38].

the unitary irreducible representations of g with structure subgroup t = t  u(1)
(a direct product for this case) represent a quantum theory of n = n 2  1 = dim(su(n))
interacting massless vector bosons. indeed, we start with f = 3n eld degrees of freedom,
corresponding to the basic operators { aj
a(x)} (the ones that have a canonically-
conjugated counterpart); the constraints (4) provide c = n independent restrictions
a(x) = 0, a = 1, . . . , n (the quantum implementation of the non-abelian gauss law),
since they are rst-class constraints and we choose the trivial representation d()
t (gt) =
1, gt = (0, 0, u(x); 1)  t , restrictions which lead to fc = f  c = 2n eld degrees of
freedom corresponding to an interacting theory of n massless vector bosons.

a(x), ej

however, more general representations d()

t (u) = eiu can be considered when we
impose additional boundary conditions like u(x) x i, that is, when we compactify the
space 3  s3 so that the gauge group t falls into disjoint homotopy classes {ul , ul
=
l} labeled by integers l  z = 3(su(n)) (the third homotopy group). the index 
(the -angle [8]) parametrizes non-equivalent quantizations, as the bloch momentum 
does for particles in periodic potentials, where the wave function acquires a phase (q +
2) = ei(q) after a translation of, let us say, 2. the phenomenon of non-equivalent
quantizations can also be reproduced by keeping the constraint condition d()
t (u) = 1
unchanged at the price of introducing a new (pseudo) cocycle  which is added to the
previous cocycle  = 1 + 2 in (25). the generating function  of  is

(g) = z d3x c0(x) ,

c = 

1
162 tr(fa 

2
3

aaa) ,

(27)

where a  a+uu1 and c0 is the temporal component of the chern-simons secondary
characteristic class c, which is the vector whose divergence equals the pontryagin den-
sity p = c =  1
162 tr(f f) (see [38], for instance). like some total derivatives
(namely, the pontryagin density), which do not modify the classical equations of mo-
tion when added to the lagrangian but have a non-trivial eect in the quantum theory,
pseudo-cocycles like  give rise to non-equivalent quantizations when the topology of
the space is aected by the imposition of certain boundary conditions (compactica-
tion of the space), even though they are trivial cocycles of the unconstrained theory.
the phenomenon of non-equivalent quantizations can be also sometimes understood as a
aharonov-bohm-like eect (an eect experienced by the quantum particle but not by the
classical particle) and d(g) = (g)
gj dgj can be seen as a induced gauge connection (see [29]
for the example of a super-conducting ring threaded by a magnetic ux) which modies
momenta according to the minimal coupling.

even more, we can consider more general representations d()

t of t (in particular,

non-abelian representations) by adding extra pseudo-cocycles to . this is the case of

(g|g)  2z d3x tr[ (log(uu)  log u  log u)] ,

(28)

which is generated by (g) = 2r d3x tr[ log u], where  = ata is a matrix carrying

some parameters a which actually characterize the representation of g.

in fact, this

12

pseudo-cocycle alters the gauge group commutators and leads to the appearance of new
central terms at the right-hand side of the last equation in (26), more explicitly:

[ a(x), b(y)] = ic c

ab(x  y) c(x)  ic c

abc(x  y) i .

(29)

abc 6= 0, join the previous { aj

for this case, new couples of generators become canonically-conjugated because of the
appearance of these new central terms proportional to the parameter c at the right-hand
side of the commutators of the gauge generators a(x). that is, new basic operators
{ a(x), b(x)}, such that c c
a(x)}, since they do
not need to be written in terms of them. constraints are second-class for this case and
only the set tc = { a(x), / c c
abc 6= 0 b} (that is, the subalgebra of non-dynamical
operators of t ), together with half of the dynamical operators of t , can be consistently
imposed as constraints. these facts lead to an increasing of eld degrees of freedom for
the constrained theory, with regard to the former (massless) case. in fact, the irreducible
representations of the algebra (26) with the new commutator (29) dene an interacting
theory of nc = dim(tc) massless vector bosons, corresponding to the unbroken gauge
subgroup tc  t with lie algebra tc, and n  nc massive-like vector bosons with mass
cubed m3

c = c (see [36, 37] for more details).

a(x), ej

summarizing, the appearance of (quantum) central terms in the lie-algebra of sym-
metries provides new degrees of freedom which are transfered to the vector potentials to
form massive vector bosons. thus, the appearance of mass seems to have a cohomological
origin, beyond any introduction of extra scalar particles (higgs bosons). nevertheless,
the physical implications of this approach deserve further study.

5 vacuum radiation and symmetry breaking in con-

formally invariant quantum field theory

the quantum theory demands an extra requirement of a symmetry in comparison with the
classical theory, namely the requirement of unitarity, and this proves to be the reason for
some breakdown in the quantum implementation of some classical symmetries of certain
physical systems. for example, the conformal group so(4, 2) has always been recognized
as a symmetry of the maxwell equations for classical electro-dynamics [39], and more
recently considered as an invariance of general, non-abelian, massless gauge eld theories
at the classical level; however, the quantum theory raises, in general, serious problems
in the implementation of conformal symmetry and much work has been devoted to the
study of the physical reasons for that (see e.g. ref.
[40]). basically, the main trouble
associated with this quantum symmetry (at the second quantization level) lies in the
diculty of nding a vacuum for massless elds, which is stable under special conformal
transformations acting on the minkowski space in the form:

x  x =

x + cx2

(x, c)

, (x, c) = 1 + 2cx + c2x2.

(30)

13

these transformations, which can be interpreted as transitions to systems of relativistic,
uniformly accelerated observers (see e.g. ref.
[41]), cause vacuum radiation, a phe-
nomenon analogous to the fulling-unruh eect [42, 43] in a non-inertial reference frame.
to be more precise, if a(k), a+(k) are the fourier components of a scalar massless eld
(x), satisfying the equation

(31)
then the fourier components a(k), a+(k) of the transformed eld (x) = l(x, c)(x)
by (30) (l being the conformal dimension) are expressed in terms of both a(k), a+(k)
through a bogolyubov transformation

(x) = 0 ,

a() = z dkha(k)a(k) + b(k)a+(k)i .

(32)

in the second quantized theory, the vacuum states dened by the conditions a(k)|0i = 0
and a()|0i = 0, are not identical if the coecients b(k) in (32) are not zero. in this
case the new vacuum has a non-trivial content of untransformed particle states.

this situation is always present when quantizing eld theories in curved space as well
as in at space, whenever some kind of global mutilation of the space is involved. this is
the case of the natural quantization in rindler coordinates [42], which leads to a quanti-
zation inequivalent to the normal minkowski quantization, or that of a quantum eld in
a box, where a dilatation produces a rearrangement of the vacuum [42]. nevertheless, it
must be stressed that the situation for sct is more peculiar. the rearrangement of the
vacuum in a massless qft due to sct, even though they are a symmetry of the classical
system, behaves as if the conformal group were spontaneously broken, and this fact can
be interpreted as some sort dynamical anomaly.

thinking of the underlying reasons for this anomaly, we are tempted to make the
singular action of the transformations (30) in minkowski space responsible for it, as has
been in fact pointed out in [44]. however, a deeper analysis of the interconnection between
symmetry and quantization reveals a more profound obstruction to the possibility of
unitarily implementing stc in a generalized minkowski space (homogeneous space of
the conformal group), free from singularities. this obstruction is traced back to the
impossibility of representing the entire so(4, 2) group unitarily and irreducibly on a
space of functions depending arbitrarily on ~x (see e.g. ref. [40]), so that a cauchy surface
determines the evolution in time. natural representations, however, can be constructed
by means of wave functions having support on the whole space-time and evolving in some
kind of proper time (related to a dilatation coordinate ). it has been proved (see [35])
that unitary irreducible representations of the conformal group require the generator p0 of
time translations to have dynamical character (i.e., it has a canonically conjugated pair),
as happens with the spatial component p1, due to the appearance of a central term i in
the quantum commutators

[ p, k] = (2 d + 4n i)

(33)
( k and d denote the generators of sct and scale transformations, respectively) pro-
portional to the extension parameter n, which characterizes the unitary irreducible rep-
resentations of the pseudo-extended conformal group g = so(4, 2) u(1), i.e., a trivial

14

central extension of so(4, 2) by u(1) with generating function n (g) = n linear in the
dilatation coordinate . that is, time is a quantum observable subject to uncertainty
relations in conformally invariant quantum mechanics on minkowski space and this fact
extends covariance rules to the quantum domain. as a consequence of this, conformal
wave functions (n )(~x, t) have support on the whole space-time. if we forced the functions
(n ) to evolve in time according to the klein-gordon-like equation

q(n ) = p p (n ) = 0 ,

(34)

(null square mass condition, i.e., by selecting those functions annihilated by the casimir
operator q of the poincare subgroup of so(4, 2)) we would nd that the appearance of
quantum terms proportional to n at the right-hand side of the quantum commutators

h k, qi = f(x, t) q + 8n p

(35)

(where f(x, t) are some functions on the generalized minkowski space), terms which do
not appear at the classical level (n = 0), prevent the whole conformal group to be an
exact symmetry of the massless quantum eld. this way, the quantum time evolution itself
destroys the conformal symmetry, leading to some sort of dynamical symmetry breaking
which preserves the weyl subgroup (poincare + dilatations). the sct do not leave
eq. (34) invariant, as can be deduced from (35), and this fact manifests itself, at the
second quantization level, through a radiation of the vacuum of a massless quantum eld
(weyl vacuum) under the action of sct. that is, from the point of view of a uniformly
accelerated observer, the weyl vacuum (which proves to be a coherent conformal state
made of zero modes) radiates like a black body. the spectrum of the outgoing particles
can be calculated exactly [35] and proves to be a generalization of the planckian one, this
being recovered in the limit n  0. the temperature t of this thermal bath is linear in the
acceleration parameter a, more precisely t = h
2ck a where k denotes boltzmanns constant
and c is the speed of light. this simple, but profound, relation between temperature and
acceleration was rst considered by unruh [43].

6 comments

several approaches to quantum theory (namely, canonical quantization, path integrals,
geometric quantization, etc) exist and all of them are still rather rooted in the classical
understanding of physical phenomena.
indeed, the reference to a classical action as a
starting point seems to be the usual prerequisite to dene a given quantum system. new
perspectives on the approach to quantum physics can provide novel insights that could not
be reached from classically-oriented formulations. also, the present state of uncertainty
for a satisfactory quantum theory of the gravitational eld demands a sound revision of
quantum mechanics.

in this paper, we have tried to capture much of the gaq avour by making use of some
relevant examples where symmetry determines the quantum physical system. central

15

extensions (and more general quantum deformations) of the underlying symmetry algebra
provide the essential ingredient for a group-oriented approach to quantum theory. among
its main virtues are the inherent formulation of quantum theories without reference to
a previous classical system, especially gauge theories, which exhibit a particular bre-
bundle structure. nevertheless, the full richness and scope of this alternative point of
view deserves further study.
