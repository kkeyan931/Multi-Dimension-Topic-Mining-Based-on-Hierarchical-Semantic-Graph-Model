p[k]

we study in the hamiltonian framework the local transformations qa( ) =
k=0 k
a(qb, qc) which leave invariant the lagrangian action: s = div.
manifest form of the symmetry and the corresponding noether identities is obtained
in the rst order formalism as well as in the hamiltonian one. the identities has
very simple form and interpretation in the hamiltonian framework. part of them
allows one to express the symmetry generators which correspond to the primarily
expressible velocities through the remaining one. other part of the identities allows
one to select subsystem of constraints with a special structure from the complete
constraint system. it means, in particular, that the above written symmetry implies
an appearance of the hamiltonian constraints up to at least ([k] + 1) stage. it is
proved also that the hamiltonian symmetries can always be presented in the form
of canonical transformation for the phase space variables. manifest form of the
resulting generating function is obtained.

1 introduction

formulation of the modern quantum eld theory models involves necessar-

ily an additional nonphysical variables. their appearance is mostly due to
our desire to incorporate the manifest poincare invariance and locality as
the leading principles of the formulation. to achieve this, the well known

and the standard method is an appropriate extension of the physical vari-
able space by the additional degrees of freedom, whose role is to supply the
desired properties of a theory [1-5]. in simple cases, one or more variables

of a transparent geometrical origin are needed (for example, for the case of
massive relativistic particle it is sucient to introduce only two variables).
in contrast, the modern theories incorporate a lot of additional variables,

whose nondynamical origin are supplied either by local symmetries pre-
sented in the lagrangian action, or by algebraic character of equations of
motion for these variables. in the hamiltonian framework it manifest him-

self in appearance of the constraint system with higher nontrivial algebraic
structure.

presence of the additional variables leads to rather complicated prob-

lems on the classical as well as on the quantum level, and the hamiltonian
methods [1-12] turn out to be well adapted for investigation of a the-
ory. hamiltonization of a lagrangian system can be formulated as proce-

dure of rewrittening of the initial dynamics in an equivalent form in terms
of extended (i.e. containing the lagrangian multipliers) phase space [1].
the result of the procedure (besides the dynamical equations of motion in

the hamiltonian form) is some system of algebraic equations, which de-
termines, in particular, physical sector of the theory. advantage of the

2

hamiltonian methods is, in particular, that phase space description allows
one to separate authomatically dynamical part of the equations of motion
from the algebraic one as well as to analyse arbitrariness of the dynamics

for the degenerated theories [4]. it crucially simplies the problem and is
an essential step for the selfconsistent transition to the quantum theory.

in general case, the above mentioned algebraic system is a mixture of

the rst and the second class constraints as well as of equations for de-
termining of the lagrangian multipliers. also, it can be reducible (there
are exist identities between the equations). the aim of this work is to

study structure of the system in a general framework. we suppose that
there is known local symmetry of the lagrangian action, which implies ap-
pearance of the corresponding noether identities among the equations of

motion. note that it seems to be natural formulation of the problem, since
the symmetries are usually known for concrete models. note also that we
do not specify relation among rank of the hessian and of the symmetry

generators. the theory under consideration can has rst and second class
constraints of any stage. we use the hamiltonization procedure with the
aim to obtain hamiltonian form of the symmetries and the corresponding

identities. as it will be shown, the resulting hamiltonian identities do not
involve of the time derivatives. in other words, they contain information on
the algebraic system under consideration. an opposite problem (the prob-

lem of restoring of gauge generators from the known constraint system) is
discussed in [3, 13-22].

for our aims it turns out to be convenient to use the hamiltonization

procedure in the form developed in [4]. according to this method, starting
from the lagrangian action one obtains rst an equivalent description for
the system in the extended phase space (qa, pa, va) (rst order formalism).
equations of motion which follows from the rst order action contain, in
particular, the algebraic one. part of them can be solved in the form

3

vi = vi(q, p, v). then the hamiltonian form of the dynamics [1] can be
obtained by means of the direct substitution of this solution into all the
quantities of the rst order formalism.

in this work we repeat these steps for the local lagrangian symmetry
and for the corresponding noether identities with the aim to obtain their
form in the hamiltonian framework. one advantage of this approach (as

compare with discussion based on the legendre transformation [24-26]) is
that it turns out to be possible to obtain manifest form of the quantities
under discussion.

the work is organized as follows. in section 2 we review rst steps of

the hamiltonization procedure [4] with the aim to introduce our notations.
then we obtain some relations among the lagrangian and the hamiltonian
quantities which will be used systematically in the following sections. in

section 3 we illustrate our tricks on example of the symmetry with at
most one derivative acting on parameters (see also [23] for the case of the
symmetry without derivatives).

in the following sections the case of a general local symmetry (see

eqs.(75),(76) below) is analysed. in subsections 4.1, 4.2 we obtain manifest
form for the corresponding identities in the rst order formalism as well
as in the hamiltonian one. it is shown that the noether identities in the

hamiltonian form acquires very simple form, their meaning is discussed in
subsection 4.3. in particular, they allows one to select some subsystem of
constraints t of the complete constraint system (see eqs.(95),(99)). we

prove also that local symmetry with [k] derivatives on parameters implies
appearance of the hamiltonian constraints up to at least ([k] + 1) stage.

in subsections 5.1, 5.2 we obtain manifest form of the local symmetry

in the rst order formalism as well as in the hamiltonian one. the rst
order action is invariant under the corresponding transformations as a con-

4

sequence of the identities. the same is true for the hamiltonian action.
we prove also that the hamiltonian symmetries can be presented (mod-
ulo trivial symmetries of the hamiltonian action) in the form of canonical

transformation for the phase space variables (see also [17-22]). the gen-
erating function is nd in a manifest form (see eq.(114) below) and is a
combination of the above mentioned constraints t . results of the work

are enumerated in the conclusion.

2 hamiltonization procedure and some relations among

the lagrangian and the hamiltonian quantities.

let us consider dynamical system with the action

s = z d l(qa, qa),

where a = 1, 2,    [a]. the corresponding equations of motion are

s
qa 

l

 qa!.
qa   l

= 0.

(1)

(2)

if will be supposed that the lagrangian l is at most polynomial on qa and
is singular

rank

2l
 qa qb  rankmab = [i] < [a].

(3)

according to this equation, it is convenient to express the index a as
a = (i, ), i = 1    [i],  = 1    [], where [] = [a]  [i]. without loss
of generality [4], the matrix mab(q, q) can be written as follows

where detmij(q, q) 6= 0. an opposite matrix will be denoted as m ij(q, q),
one has mij m jk = i

k.

mab = 


mij mi
mj m

,

(4)

as the rst step of the hamiltonization procedure, let us rewrite the
theory (1) in terms of the rst order action dened on the extended phase
space (qa( ), pa( ), va( ))

sv = z d h l(qa, va) + pa( qa  va)i ,

where l = l(q, q)| qava. all the variables are considered on equal footing.
in particular, one writes equations of motion for all of them

actions s and sv describe the same dynamics in the following sense.
a) if qa
0 ( ) is some solution of the problem (2), then the set of functions

0 ,
b) if the set (qa

to eq.(2). in accordance with the condition (3) one resolves eq.(8) for the
multipliers vi algebraically

0 ) is a solution of the system (6)-(8), then qa

0 , p0a, va

p0a  l

vi = vi(qa, pj, v).

(10)

hamiltonian form [1] of the initial dynamics can be obtained now by means
of substitution of the eq.(10) into all the quantities of the rst order for-
malism. we use symbols with bar to denote quantities of the rst order

formalism and symbols without bar for the hamiltonian quantities

ra  ra(q, q)| qava,

6

ra  ra|vi(qa,pj,v).

(11)

consider rst equations of motion (6)-(8). substitution of eq.(10) into

eq.(8) gives the identity

i  pi 

while eq.(7) acquire the form

 0 

 0,

(12)

h

vi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi

 l

v(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi

 l

(q, p)  p 

= p  f(qa, pj) = 0.

(13)

note that eq.(13) do not contains the multipliers v (in other case one
can use eq.(13) and to express some of the multipliers v
through the
remaining one, in contradiction with the condition (3)). eq.(13) determines
the primary hamiltonian constraints .



to nd manifest form of equations (6) with the multipliers vi substi-

tuted, one introduces hamiltonian

h(qa, pa, v)  h|vi = (pava  l(q, v))|vi.

it obeys the equation

dh
dv = (q, p),

which can be demonstrated as follows

dh
dv =

+

h

v(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi

h

vi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi

vi
v = (q, p),

where eqs.(12),(13) were used. general solution of eq.(15) is

h(qa, pa, v) = h0(q, p) + v(q, p),

where h0 can be nd by comparison of equations (17) and (14)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

h0(qa, pj) = 

v
pivi  l(q, v) + v  l
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi(qa,pj,v)

7

.

(18)

nontrivial part of this statement is that h0 do not depends on the variables
v (and p). thus we have obtained manifest form of the hamiltonian
(17),(18) for an arbitrary lagrangian action (1). using the same triks as

in eq.(16) one nds also

=

h

=

.

(19)

h

qa(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi

h

pa(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi

it allows one to substitute the functions vi(qa, pj, v) into eq.(6). in the
result, hamiltonian form of the dynamics is

qa = {qa, h},

pa = {pa, h},

  p  f(qa, pj) = 0.

(20)

(21)

note that to obtain eq.(20),(21) we have combined in fact eq.(8) with
other equations of the system (6)-(8). it means that the systems (6)-(8)

and (20),(21) are equivalent to each other. the rst order action (5) can
also be rewritten in the hamiltonian form. namely, one notes that the
quantity

sh  sv|vi = z d (pa qa  h0  v),

(22)

reproduces the equations of motion (20), (21).

in the following sections we repeat these steps for the local symmetries
and for the corresponding lagrangian identities with the aim to obtain

manifest form for these quantities in the hamiltonian framework.
it is
now convenient to enumerate some relations among the lagrangian and the
hamiltonian objects which will be used systematically in the subsequent

sections.

since eq.(12) is identity, one has i

v  0, which can be rewritten as
ij mj|vi =  m ijmj. on other hand, from equations (6) and

vi

v =  m

8

(20) it follows vi(qa, pj, v) = {qi, h}. it can also be used for computation
of the derivative. collecting these two results one has

vi
v =  m ijmj = {qi, }.

other derivatives can be obtained in a similar fashion

vi
pa

= m ija

j = {qi{qj, h}}a
j ,

vi

qa =  m ij 2 l
vjqa(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi

= {pa{qi, h}}.

we can use these relations for obtaining derivatives of the constraints (13)
as follows

part of equations from (27), (28) is equivalent to eqs.(23), (25). also, for
any function t (qa, va) one nds

and for a set of functions ca

further, from the condition (3) it follows, in particular, that the matrix
mab|vi has [] independent null vectors. let us demonstrate that for an
arbitrary theory they are


pa

 






mj m ji

 ,  = 1, 2, . . . , [],

mba|vi


pa

= 0.

actually, from eq.(27) one has


pb

= ma  mai m ijmj.

mab(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi

for the case a =  the right hand side is zero according to eq.(26), while
for a = k one has mk  mki m ijmj = mk  mk = 0, from which it
follows eq.(33). from the right hand side of the equality (32) it follows
that these null vectors are linearly independent.

at last, by using of eq.(25),(18),(19), some combinations of the la-
grangian derivatives can be presented in the hamiltonian form as follows:

(32)

(33)

3 symmetries with at most one derivative acting on

parameters.

hamiltonization of the local symmetries and the corresponding noether
identities for the general case implies suciently tedious algebraic manip-
ulations. so, in this section we demonstrate all the necessary tricks on

example of a symmetry with at most one derivative acting on parameters
(symmetry without derivatives was considered in [23]). namely, let us
consider innitesimal local transformations of the form

qa = ar0a

a(q, q) + ar1a

a(q, q),

(38)

and suppose that the action (1) is invariant up to total derivative term

s = z d (a0a + a1a).,

(39)

where 0a, 1a are some functions. if eq.(38) depends essentially on all the
parameters a( ), a = 1, . . . , [a] (namely, if rankr1a
a = [a]), then [a]  [],
as it can be seen from eq.(47) below.

3.1 lagrangian identities in the rst order formalism.

real consequence of the property (39) is appearance of identities among
the equations of motion for the theory. to obtain them let us write eq.(39)
in the form of a series on derivatives of a

which can be used in eq.(42) and gives the noether identities in the form

s

(44)

further, this expression can be presented in the form of a series on deriva-
tives of qa. it is convenient to introduce the notation

kia(q, q)

where i = 1, 2. then the series looks as

(46)

since it is true for any qa( ), the square brackets in eq.(46) must be zero
separately.
it gives the nal form of the lagrangian identities for our
theory. since they are fulled for any qa( ), they will remain identities
after the substitution qa( )  va( ). in the result we obtain identities
of the rst order formalism

(50)

below we demonstrate that eqs.(47)-(49) supply invariance of the rst or-
der action (5) under the corresponding local transformations (see eq.(65)-
(67)).

3.2 hamiltonian form of the identities.

let us obtain hamiltonian form of the identities, i.e. we perform substitu-
tion of the multipliers vi(qa, pj, v) into eqs.(47)-(49).

in acordance with our division of the index: a = (i, ), eq.(47) can be

rewritten as

r1a

i =  m

ij mj r1a

,

( m  mi

m

ij mj) r1a

 = 0,

and substitution of the multipliers vi gives

r1a

i = {qi, }r1a

.

(51)

(52)

(53)

eq.(52) does not contain new information, see eq.(26). similarly, eq.(48)
is equivalent to the pair

r0a

i   m ijmjr0a

 


pi

k1a,


v

k1a  0,

13

(54)

(55)

where eqs.(51),(52),(29),(30) were used. by using of eqs.(23),(37) we nd
nally

r0a

i  {qi, }r0a

  {qi, r1a

{, h}},


v (r1a

{, h})  0.

(56)

(57)

to substitute the multipliers vi(qa, pj, v) into the rst term of eq.(49) we
use eqs.(35),(36), (54), with the result being

k0a = r0a

{, h} +

for the second term of eq.(49) one has after some algebra

nds nally the hamiltonian form of eq.(49)

(60)

thus, we have obtained hamiltonian form of the identities. they can be

divided on two parts. the rst part means that in arbitrary theory the
generators r1a

i|vi can be expressed through the remainig one

i|vi, r0a

r0a

i = {qi, }r0a

r1a

.

i = {qi, }r1a

the second part involves only the generators r and is


v (r1a

{, h}  {r1a

{, h}, h}  0.

3.3 local symmetry of the rst order action.

let us return to discussion of the local symmetries structure. first we note
that the following transformations

k1a,

va = (qa).,

(65)

(66)

(67)

leave invariant the rst order action (5), as a consequence of the identites
(47)-(49). actually, variation of the action sv under eqs.(65),(67) and
under some pa can be presented as (up to total derivative)

sv = z d a k0a + a k1a  va mab(a r0a

where integration by parts for the second term in eq.(68) was performed.
the rst and the second lines in eq.(69) are zero according to eqs.(47)-(49).
then the variation sv will be total derivative if we take pa according to
eq.(66).

3.4 local symmetry of the hamiltonian action.

from the discussion in section 2 one expects that the transformations (65)-
(67) with the multipliers vi substituted will be symmetry of the hamilto-
nian action (22). let us nd their manifest form. using eqs.(62),(61) one
has for the variation qi|vi

qi|vi = (cid:16)ar0a

{, h}o .
the variation q|vi can be identically rewritten in a similar form

(cid:17) {qi, }  anqi, r1a

(cid:16)ar0a

q|vi = ar0a

hamiltonian action (22) is invariant under these transformations, as a
consequence of the identities (63),(64). up to total derivative, variation of

the rst term in eq.(22) can be expressed as follows
{, h}  a v

while for the second term one has

collecting these terms and using eqs.(63),(64) one has sh = div.

1we show below that presence of the term

 in eq.(75) implies appearance of k-tiary hamiltonian
constraints. from this it follows that [k] <  for a mechanical system with nite number of degrees of
freedom. also, with any transformation which involve variation of the evolution parameter: , qa one
associates unambiguosly the transformations of the form (75) as follows:  = 0, qa =  qa + qa. if

substitute rst equation of the system (77) into the second one and so on,

a = 1, 2,    , [a].

(80)

note that the s(i)a is at most linear on qa and the maximum possible
degree of the time derivative in eq.(80) is [k] + 2. further, eq.(80) can be

18

presented in the form of a series which consist of the terms
k1qa1    kpqapx(a1ap)a(q, q), where the possible values for p, ki are: p =
0, 1,    ,(cid:20) [k]+2

(cid:21), ki  2, p ki  [k] + 2, and all the coecients x(a1ap)a

are symmetric on their indices ai. since eq.(80) is fulled for an arbitrary
qa( ) one concludes

2

x(a1ap)a(q, q)  0.

(81)

remarkable fact is that only a  [a]  ([k] + 1) + a functions x from eq.(81)
turns out to be independent. namely, the direct and tedious calculation

gives the following independent identities which follow form eq.(80)

this system can be expressed further in an equivalent form in terms of the
quantities k(i)a only. actually, using the second equation of the system
(82) in the third one and so on, one convinces that all the terms which are
proportional to qa disappears. this form of the identities was obtained also
in [26] and used for analysis of constraint algebra in a theory without second
class constraints. since the resulting equations are satised for an arbitrary
qa( ), they will remain identites after the substitution qa( )  va( ).

supply invariance of the rst order action under the corresponding local

4.2 hamiltonian form of the identities.

since eq.(87),(88) are fulled for an arbitrary va( ), they will remain iden-
tities after substitution of the multipliers vi(qa, pj, v) according to eq.(10).
this procedure gives identities of the hamiltonian formulation. in partic-
ular, they supply invariance of the hamiltonian action (22) under the cor-
responding transformations (see eq.(107)-(109) below) as well as contain

information on the structure of the hamiltonian constraint system. let
us obtain manifest form of the identities. the parts b = i and b =  of
eq.(87) are

we can nd the generators ri from eq.(89) and substitute into eq.(90),

4.3 hamiltonian identities and the complete constraint system.

the hamiltonian identites (97) states, in particular, that the quantites
p, p = 2, 3, . . . , ([k]+1) are functions of the phase space variables (qa, pj)

ta
only. their manifest form is

(99)

. . .

meaning of these quantites becames clear if we compare eq.(99) with the

second, third . . . stages of the dirac-bergmann procedure. the second
stage is to investigate structure of the system {h, } = 0.
it can be

23

rewritten in the canonical form, one has schematically 2

g(q, p, v)
(2)(q, p)

{h, } = q(q, p)

= 0,

detq 6= 0,

(100)

where the part g(q, p, v) = 0 contains (if any) equations for determining of
the multipliers, while the part (2) = 0 determines secondary constraints
of the theory. from comparison of eq.(100) with the rst equation of the
(2) are some combinations
system (99) one concludes that the quantites ta
of the secondary constraints (2). analogously, the third step is

which allows one to identity the quantites ta

thus, the quantites ta

(p), p = 2, 3, . . . , ([k] + 1) which appears in the
hamiltonian identities (97) can be identied with some of the p-ary con-
straints. then the identity (98) means that ([k] + 1)-ary constraints do not

create neither ([k] + 2)-ary constraints nor equations for determining of the
multipliers.

from this it follows, in particular, that a theory with the local symmetry
(75) necessarily has the hamiltonian constraints up to at least ([k] + 1)-
stage.

note that the subsystem of constraints ta

(p) has very special structure.

combination of the equations (111) and (112) has the desired canonical

we have obtained manifest form of the symmetry and of the corresponding

as well as in the hamiltonian one (eqs.(107)- (109), (96)-(98)). the iden-
tities supply invariance of the rst order action and of the hamiltonian one

under the corresponding transformations.

the hamiltonian identities consist of two parts. the rst part

4. local symmetry (115) for the lagrangian theory implies appearance

of the hamiltonian constraints up to at least ([k] + 1) stage.

from the previous discussion one expects that the constraints ta
rst class in the complete constraint system. also, from eqs. (117)-(119)
it follows that for the simple cases (symmetry without derivative or with

one derivative only) the gauge generators r can be easily restored starting
from the hamiltonian formulation. we hope that the results obtained
allows one to formulate a simplied procedure (as compare with [14, 21])

for the general case also. these problems will be discussed in a forthcoming
paper.
