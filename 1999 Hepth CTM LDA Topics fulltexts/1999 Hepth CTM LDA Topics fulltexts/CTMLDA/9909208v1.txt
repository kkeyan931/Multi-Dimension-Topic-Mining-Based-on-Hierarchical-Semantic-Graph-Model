abstract. we outline a derivation of area law of the wilson loop in su(n) yang-
mills theory in the maximal abelian gauge. this is based on a new version of non-
abelian stokes theorem and the novel reformulation of the yang-mills theory. abelian
dominance and monopole dominance of the string tension in su(n) qcd are immediate
consequences of this derivation.

introduction

in the dual superconductor picture [1] of quark connement, the magnetic
monopoles give the dominant contribution to the area law of the wilson loop or
the string tension. based on t hooft argument [2], the partial gauge xing g  h
realizes the magnetic monopole in yang-mills gauge theory in the absence of ele-
mentary scalar eld. in the conventional approach based on the maximal abelian
(ma) gauge, the residual gauge group was chosen to be the maximal torus sub-
group h = u(1)n1 for g = su(n). this choice immediately determines the type
of magnetic monopoles. we re-examine this issue. we learn that the magnetic
monopole which is responsible for area law of the wilson loop is determined by
the maximal stability group h rather than the residual gauge group h. this is a
new feature appeared in su(n), n  3, which was overlooked so far in the lattice
community as far as i know. indeed, this situation occurs only for su(n), n  3.
therefore, we must distinguish the maximal stability group h from the residual
gauge group h. in general, the maximal stability group h is larger than the max-
imal torus subgroup, h = u(1)n1  h. so, the coset g/ h  g/h. we derive
area law of the wilson loop in su(n) yang-mills theory in the ma gauge. this is
performed based on the results of a series of works [38].

coherent state

first of all, we construct the coherent state |, i corresponding to the coset
representatives   g/ h. we dene the maximal stability subgroup (isotropy
subgroup) h as a subgroup of g that consists of all the group elements h that leave
the highest-weight state |i invariant up to a phase factor, i.e., h|i = |iei(h), h 
h. the phase factor is unimportant in the following discussion because we consider
the expectation value of any operators in the coherent state. the maximal stability
subgroup h includes the cartan subgroup h = u(1)r, i.e., h  h.

let h be the cartan subgroup of g and h be the cartan subalgebra in g. for
every element g  g, there is a unique decomposition of g into a product of two
group elements, g = h,   g/ h, h  h, for g  g. we can obtain a unique coset
space g/ h for a given |i. the action of arbitrary group element g  g on |i is
given by g|i = h|i = |iei(h).

the coherent state is constructed as |, i = |i. this denition of the coherent
state is in one-to-one correspondence with the coset space g/ h and the coherent
states preserve all the algebraic and topological properties of the coset space g/ h.
if (g) is hermitian, then hi = hi, and e = e. every group element g  g
can be written as the exponential of a complex linear combination of diagonal
operators hi and o-diagonal shift operators e. thus the coherent state is given
by

|, i = |i = exp
x 

(e  e)

 |i,

  c,

(1)

where |i is the highest-weight state (hj|i = j|i, e|i = 0 for   r+,
r+(r) is a subsystem of positive (negative) roots.) such that
(i) |i is annihilated by all the (o-diagonal) shift-up operators e with  > 0,

e|i = 0( > 0);

(ii) |i is mapped into itself by all diagonal operators hi, hi|i = i|i;

(iii) |i is annihilated by some shift-down operators e with  < 0, not by other
e with  < 0: e|i = 0(some  < 0); e|i = | + i(some  < 0); and

the sum p  is restricted to those shift operators e which obey (iii).

the coherent states are normalized to unity, h, |, i = 1, but, are non-
orthogonal, h, |, i 6= 0. the coherent state spans the entire space v . by
making use of the the group-invariant measure d() of g which is appropriately

normalized, we obtain r |, id()h, | = i, which shows that the coherent states

are complete, but overcomplete. this resolution of identity is very important to
obtain the path integral formula given below. the coherent states |, i are in
one-to-one correspondence with the coset representatives   g/ h, |, i  g/ h.
in other words, |, i and   g/ h are topologically equivalent.

for concreteness, we rst focus on the su(3) case. the highest weight  of the
representation specied by the dynkin index [m, n] (m, n: integers) can be written
as ~ = m~h1 + n~h2 (m, n are non-negative integers for the highest weight) where
h1, h2 are highest weights of two fundamental representations of su(3) correspond-
ing to [1, 0], [0, 1] respectively, i.e., ~h1 = (cid:16) 1
23(cid:17) . therefore, we
2, 1
2 ,
obtain ~ = (cid:16) m+n
23 (cid:17) . if mn = 0, i.e., m = 0 or n = 0, the maximal stability
group h is given by h = u(2) (case (i)). such a degenerate case occurs when the
highest-weight vector ~ is orthogonal to some root vectors. if mn 6= 0, i.e., m 6= 0
and n 6= 0, h is the maximal torus group h = u(1)  u(1) (case (ii)). this is a
non-degenerate case. therefore, for the highest weight  in the case (i), the coset
g/ h is given by

~h2 = (cid:16) 1

23(cid:17) ,

, mn

su(3)/u(2) = su(3)/(su(2)  u(1)) = cp 2,

whereas in the case (ii)

su(3)/(u(1)  u(1)) = f2.

(2)

(3)

here, cp n is the complex projective space and fn is the ag space. therefore, the
two fundamental representations belong to the case (i), so the maximal stability
group is u(2), rather than the maximal torus group u(1)  u(1).

non-abelian stokes theorem

we have derived a new version of non-abelian stokes theorem (nast) [9,10].
for the non-abelian wilson loop dened by the trace of the path-ordered exponent
along the closed loop c,

w c[a] := tr(cid:20)p exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)(cid:21) ,
 (x)t adx = aa(x)t a, the

(4)

with a being the connection one-form, a(x) = aa
nast for su(n) is given by

w c[a] = z [d()]c exp igic "naaa +

#!
= z [d()]c exp igzs:s=c"d(naaa) +

1
g

1
g

k#! ,

where we have dened

na(x) := h|v (x)t av (x)|i,
(x) := h|iv (x)dv (x)|i = h|i(x)d(x)|i,

(5)

(6)
(7)

and k is the kahler two-form given by

k := d.

the nast (5) implies that the wilson loop is rewritten into

w c[a] = z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19) = z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igzs:c=s

f(cid:19) .

first, a is the connection one-form,

a := naaa +

1
g

 = h|av |i,

(8)

(9)

(10)

where av := v av  + i
quark in the fundamental representation,

g v dv  is the gauge transformation of a by v  fn1. for

a = tr(hav ).

(11)

therefore, the one-form a is equal to the diagonal piece of the gauge-transformed
potential av . next, f is the curvature two-form,

f := da = dc +

1
g

d = dc +

1
g

k,

(12)

where we dened the one-form, c := naaa. the rst piece dc in f does not
contribute to the magnetic current, due to the bianchi identity. on the other
hand, the second term k in f leads to the non-vanishing magnetic current,

k := f 6= 0,

(13)

where f is the hodge dual of f in four dimensions, f := 1
2f. in
general, the (curvature) two-form f = d(naaa) + k in the nast is the abelian
eld strength (which is invariant even under the non-abelian gauge transformation
of g = su(n)), i.e., the generalized t hooft-polyakov tensor for su(n),

f(x) := (na(x)aa

 (x))  (na(x)aa

 (x)) +

i
g

n(x)  [n(x),  n(x)].

(14)

the invariance of f is obvious from the nast (9), since the l.h.s. of (9), i.e.,
w c[a] is gauge invariant and the measure [d()]c in the r.h.s. is also in-
variant under the g gauge transformation. otherwise, the r.h.s. is zero.
in
the case of fundamental representation, the invariance is easily seen, because it
is possible to rewrite (14) into the manifestly gauge invariant form: f(x) :=

tr(cid:16)n(x)f(x) + i

ig[a(x), a(x)], and dn(x) := n(x)  ig[a(x), n(x)].

g n(x)  [dn(x), d n(x)](cid:17) , where f(x) := a(x) a(x)

abelian dominance

in our framework, the abelian dominance and the monopole dominance are un-

derstood as implying the rst and the second equality respectively,

dw c[a]ey m

= d exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)eap egt

= d exp(cid:18)iic

(cid:19)eap egt

,

(15)

where apegt denotes the abelian-projected eective gauge theory [3]. numerical
simulations show that the monopole part exhibits the area law and abel exhausts
the full string tension obtained from the non-abelian wilson loop (i.e., monopole
dominance in the string tension or area law),

d exp(cid:18)iic

(cid:19)eap egt

 exp(abel|s|),

(16)

while d exp (ighc a  ihc )eap egt

implies that the area law of the original non-abelian wilson loop,

does not exhibits the area law. this result

dw c[a]ey m

 exp(|s|),

 = abel.

(17)

the monopole dominance in this sense was derived for su(2) in [6] by showing that
the dominant contribution to the area law comes from the monopole piece alone,
k = d. in [7], the monopole dominance and the area law of the wilson loop
have been shown based on the apegt for g = su(2). now this scenario can be
extended into g = su(n).

magnetic monopoles in yang-mills theory

the existence of magnetic monopole is suggested from the non-trivial homotopy
groups 2(g/h). in the case (ii), 2(f2) = 2(su(3)/(u(1)  u(1))) = 1(u(1) 
u(1)) = z + z. on the other hand, in the case (i), i.e., [m,0] or [0,n] 2(cp 2) =
2(su(3)/u(2)) = 1(u(2)) = 1(su(2)  u(1)) = 1(u(1)) = z. note that cp n
nlsm has only the local u(1) invariance for any n. it is this u(1) invariance that
corresponds to a kind of abelian magnetic monopole in the case (i). this magnetic
monopole may be related to the non-abelian magnetic monopole proposed by e.
weinberg et al.

this situation should be compared with the su(2) case where the maximal sta-
bility group is always given by the maximal torus h = u(1) irrespective of the
representation. therefore, the coset is given by g/h = su(2)/u(1) = f1 =
cp 1 = s2 = so(3) and 2(su(2)/u(1)) = 2(f1) = 2(cp 1) = z, for arbitrary
representation . actually, the nast derived in this paper shows that the funda-
mental quark feels only the u(1) embedded in the maximal stability group u(2) as
a magnetic monopole (this is a component along the highest-weight).

area law of the wilson loop

the (full) string tension  is dened by

 :=  lim

a(c)

1

a(c)

lnhw c[a]iy m4,

(18)

where a(c) is the minimal area spanned by the wilson loop c.

we estimate the wilson loop in the reformulation of the yang-mills theory which
was proposed by the author and was called the perturbative deformation of a topo-
logical quantum eld theory [4]. the wilson loop is written as

hw c[a]iy m4 =** exp(cid:20)igic

dxna(x)v a

 (x)(cid:21)+py m4

exp(cid:20)iic

(cid:21)+t qf t4

.

(19)

here the expectation value h(  )ivpy m for the eld v is calculated in the pertur-
bation theory in the coupling constant g. on the other hand, the expectation
value h(  )iu
t qf t should be calculated in a non-perturbative way to incorporate
the topological contribution where u is a compact gauge variable,

st qf t [, c, c, b] := zr4

d4x ib btrg/h (cid:20) 1

2

(x)(x) + ic(x) c(x)(cid:21) ,

where (x) := i

g u(x)u(x). this reformulation leads to the result:

hw c[a]iy m4 =* exp(cid:20)iic

(cid:21)+t qf t4h1 + o(g2)i .

(20)

(21)

this implies the magnetic monopole dominance in the area law of the wilson loop.
for the planar wilson loop c, the parisi-soulous dimensional reduction [4] leads

to

d exp(cid:20)iic

(cid:21)et qf t4

= d exp(cid:20)iic

(cid:21)en lsm2

,

where the two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model (nlsm) has the action,

sn lsm [u, c, c] := 2zr2

d2x trg/h (cid:20)1

2

(x)(x) + ic(x) c(x)(cid:21) .

(22)

(23)

by making use of the complex coordinates of the ag space g/h, the action is
rewritten as

sn lsm =

=

(25)

where z = x + iy = x1 + ix2  c = r2, and dxdy = dx1dx2 = i
2dzdz, and
we have omitted the ghost term, c(x) c(x). here g() is the running yang-mills
coupling constant whose running is given by the perturbative deformation in four-
dimensional yang-mills theory. for the quark in the fundamental representation of
su(n), the relevant nlsm is given by cp n1 model. we can show the area law,

* exp(cid:20)iic

(cid:21)+cp n 1

2

 exp(0t r),

(26)

by the instanton calculus (dilute instanton-gas approximation) or by the large n
expansion in the two-dimensional cp n1 model, see [10].

in summary, we have given a new derivation of non-abelian stokes theorem for
g = su(n) for n  2 which reduces to the previous result for su(2). this
version of non-abelian wilson loop is very helpful to see the role played by the
magnetic monopole in the calculation of the non-abelian wilson loop. combining
this non-abelian stokes theorem with the abelian-projected eective gauge theory
for su(n), we have explained the abelian dominance for the wilson loop in su(n)
yang-mills gauge theory. for su(n) with n greater than two, we must distinguish
the maximal stability group h and the residual gauge group h = u(1)n1.

by making use of the non-abelian stokes theorem in a novel reformulation of
the yang-mills theory proposed by one of the authors [4], the derivation of the
area law of the non-abelian wilson loop in four-dimensional yang-mills theory has
been reduced to the two-dimensional problem of calculating the expectation value
of the abelian wilson loop in the coset g/h non-linear sigma model. especially,
in order to show connement of the fundamental quark in four-dimensional su(n)
yang-mills theory in the ma gauge, we have only to consider the two-dimensional
cp n1 model. the details will be given in [9,10]. a monte carlo simulation on a
lattice will be ecient to conrm the above picture of quark connement.
