abstract

a new type of non-abelian generalization of the born-infeld action is proposed, in
which the spacetime indices and group indices are combined. the action is manifestly
lorentz and gauge invariant.
in its power expansion, the lowest order term is the
yang-mills action and the second term corresponds to the bosonic stringy correction to
this action. solutions of the euler-lagrange equation for the su(2) case are considered
and we show that there exists an instanton-like solution which has winding number
one and nite action.

1 introduction

the born-infeld action [1] has been of renewed attention for reasons connected with m/string
theory, but perhaps interest has also been enhanced by its compact and elegant form. there
have been several proposals for the non-abelian generalization of the born-infeld action
by taking either a trace [2], an anti-symmetrized trace [3] or a symmetrized trace [4] of
the group indices after formally expanding the ordinary born-infeld lagrangian with the
non-abelian gauge elds substituted. in particular, the anti-symmetrized trace structure
generates only odd powers of the eld strength, f , while the symmetrized trace structure
gives only even powers. bosonic stringy corrections to the yang-mills action give a f 3 term
at the lowest order [5] while for superstring theory the cubic term is absent [6,7]. however,
the issue as to what is the natural non-abelian generalization of the born-infeld action
does not seem to have been resolved fully yet [8].
in this paper, we propose a dierent non-abelian generalization of the born-infeld action
for su(n) gauge elds, where the spacetime indices and group indices are combined to-
gether. the action is manifestly lorentz and gauge invariant. in its power expansion, the
lowest order term is the yang-mills action and the second term corresponds to the bosonic
stringy correction to this action. solutions of the euler-lagrange equation for the su(2)
case are considered1 and we show that there exists an instanton-like solution which has
winding number one and nite action.

2 non-abelian born-infeld lagrangian

the generators of the su(n) group in the fundamental representation, t a = t a, tr t a =
0, a = 1, 2,   , n 2  1, may be chosen conventionally to satisfy
2(idabc + f abc)t c

2n ab + 1

(2.1)

t at b =  1

where dabc, f abc are real and totally symmetric, anti-symmetric over the indices, a, b, c.
eq.(2.1) implies

(2.2)
and a completeness relation follows from the fact that {1, t a} forms a basis of n  n
matrices

action were discussed in [9].

the gauge eld, a, is lie algebra valued

a = aa

t a

and the eld strength is given by

f = a  a + [a, a]

(2.4)

(2.5)

in this paper, we regard the eld strength, f , as a nd  nd matrix acting on
rn
gauge  rd
and group index, , together

spacetime, where d is the spacetime dimension, by pairing the spacetime index, ,

f,   f a

t a



we also expand the spacetime metric, g, to a nd  nd matrix

the non-abelian yang-mills kinetic term is then

f a =  1

where f is a nd  nd matrix given by

tr and det indicate the trace and determinant of nd  nd matrices.
the proposed non-abelian generalization of the born-infeld lagrangian is then

where  is a coupling constant. in the second line we have used the identity,
detm = exp(tr ln m).

3 su(2) action in four-dimensional euclidean space

we now consider the gauge group su(2) and also restrict to four-dimensional euclidean
space, x0  ix4,  =  so that upper and lower lorentz indices may be identied.
we take t a =  i
if we dene e,  =  with a 2  2 anti-symmetric matrix, , then from a = (a)t,
e(g + f ) is anti-symmetric so that

2 a, f abc = abc, where a, a = 1, 2, 3 are pauli matrices.

det(g + f ) = (pfaan(eg + ef ))2

(3.1)

using this for the su(2) case, the lagrangian (2.10), l  le, becomes

now we seek an so(4) invariant solution in four-dimensional euclidean space by adopting
the ansatz of [10]

a(x) = f (r)g(x)1g(x)

g(x) =

1
r

(x4  ixii)  su(2)

(3.3)

where r = qx2 + x2

after some calculation, we get

f = (x(  ) + y ) xg1g
f  = 1

where

using the bianchi identity

f  = 0

and

the equation of motion (2.13) gives a second order dierential equation

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

0 = f (1+y )(12y )+2(2f1)(x 2+42x 2y y +2y 2)+x(15y 62x 2) (3.9)
with the ansatz (3.3) the action becomes

se = 22 r 

0 dr r3 le(r, )

le(r, ) = 42 (cid:16)1  (1 + y )(1  2y  32x 2)

1

2(cid:17)

(3.10a)

(3.10b)

one may verify that the equation of motion for this one-dimensional action is identical to
eq.(3.9).
if we denote the k dependence of the solution explicitly as f (r, ) then from eq.(3.9) we get
the following scale property

f (r, ) = f (r/, 1)

(3.11)

5

in fact by letting r/  r it is easy to see that  can be removed from the action so that
eectively we may take  = 1.
we have not been able to obtain an analytic solution of eq.(3.9) for  6= 0. however, it is
easy to see that there are three stationary solutions5

f (r) = 1
2,

f (r) = 0,

f (r) = 1

(3.12)

2 and zero for f = 0, 1.

the action (3.10a) is innity for f = 1
we dene an instanton-like solution as one which interpolates between f (0) = 0 and f (r) 
1 as r  . eq.(3.9) is invariant under f (r)  1  f (r). this relates the instanton-like
solution to the anti-instanton-like solution, fa(r) = 1  fi(r).
the same situation occurs for the yang-mills action, where the equation of motion is given
by eq.(3.9) with  = 0

the instanton solution for the yang-mills action is of the exact form

0 = f r2 + f r  4(2f  1)(f  1)f

fy m (r) =

r2

r2 + a

which may be obtained by solving x = y .
now if we write f for large r as

(3.13)

(3.14)

f (r) =  + p

n=0 anrn

 < 0

(3.15)

and substitute this expression into eq.(3.9) then we get  = 2,  = 0, 1. choosing  = 1
and  = 1 we get an instanton-like solution

fi(r) = 1  a

1

r2 + a2 1

r4  (a3 + a2)

1
r6 +   

(3.16)

where a is a free parameter.
a similar analysis can be done for small r and gives

f i(r) = br2  3+20b

3+12b b2r4 + 9+153b+618b2 464b33584b4

9(12b)(1+4b)3

b3r6 +   

(3.17)

where b is a free parameter.
if eqs.(3.16, 3.17) are well dened for r  s, r  s respectively and there exist constants
a, b such that f i(s) = fi(s), f i(s) = f 
i (s), then the instanton/anti-instanton-like solutions
5 see the appendix for some analysis of the linearized version of eq.(3.9) around the stationary solutions.

are well dened globally.6
with initial conditions, f (0) = 0, f (0) = 0, some numerical analysis7 support this instanton-
like solution:

as r  , we have f  1 for the instanton-like solution (3.16) and hence

a  g1g,

f  0

(3.18)

in general this condition is sucient for the integral of the chern-pontryagin density,
f a

, to be identical with the topological cartan-maurer form, since

f a

f a

f a

 = tr( 4

3aaa  4a

f )

(3.19)

and the rst term gives the cartan-maurer form as a surface integral which depends on
only the value of f at innity while the second term vanishes [11]. thus our instanton-like
solution has the same winding number as the ordinary instanton solution in the yang-mills
action, which is one

 1

322 r d4x f a

f a

 = 1

(3.20)

a similar analysis can be done for the anti-instanton-like solution, where a(x) has the
same singularity at the origin as the ordinary anti-instanton solution of the yang-mills
theory. hence the winding number is minus one.

6in consequence, there will be no free parameter left contrary to the ordinary instanton solutions, where
conformal symmetry of the yang-mills action allows a free parameter. however, we have not been able to
get the exact values of a, b.

7we put  = 1 for the numerical analysis, fig. 1, 2, 3.

some numerical analysis also support this result. furthermore the action, s, seems8 to
have the exact value, 82.

4 comment

in four-dimensions the bianchi identity (3.7) and the equation of motion (2.13) show that
f  and  satisfy the same equation. from this observation one may consider solutions
of

 = c f 

(4.1)

where c is a constant.
eq.(4.1) reduces to the ordinary self-dual equation for the yang-mills action. hence, one
may regard eq.(4.1) as a self-dual equation for general actions.
in the case of su(2), from the completeness relation (2.3) and eq.(2.12), eq.(4.1) leads to

0 = (g + f )1

using the identity
