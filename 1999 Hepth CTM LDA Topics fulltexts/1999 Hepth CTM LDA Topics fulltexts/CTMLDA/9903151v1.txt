abstract

we study the applicability of pade approximants (pa) to estimate a sum of
asymptotic series of the type appearing in qcd. we indicate that one should not
expect pa to converge for positive values of the coupling constant and propose to
use pa for the borel transform of the series. if the latter has poles on the positive
semiaxis, the borel integral does not exist, but we point out that the cauchy
pricipal value integral can exist and that it represents one of the possible sums
of the original series, the one that is real on the positive semiaxis. we mention
how this method works for bjorken sum rule, and study in detail its application
to series appearing for the running coupling constant for the richardson static
qcd potential. we also indicate that the same method should work if the borel
transform has branchpoints on the positive semiaxis and support this claim by a
simple numerical experiment.

1 introduction

perturbative expansions appearing in qcd and many of its models simmulating
various interesting features of this theory have, usually, coecients growing so fast
that it is dicult to obtain an increased precision by naive adding of subsequent
terms [1],[2].

pade approximants (pa) are an eective tool to sum an asymptotic series
[3],[4], however they may not necesserily sum it to the function that has the required
analytic properties. we must remember that there is an innite number of analytic
functions having the same asymptotic expansion, and the additional requirements
stemming from the physical meaning of the function can help us to diminish this
abundance.

we shall rst illustrate this problem on the very simple example and show that
the use of the borel integral can be of help here. as we expect the perturbation
series in qcd to have coecients growing like n!k nn [2] let us consider the simplest
series of this type - the euler series:

e(z) =

n!zn



xn=0

it is well known [3],[4] that pa to this series converge to the function:

e(z) = z 

0

eu

1  zu

du

(1)

(2)

in the whole complex plane with the positive semiaxis excluded. the function has
the branch point at z = 0 and pa reconstruct the branch of this function which
is real on the negative semiaxis and has cut along the positive one. in qcd the
expansion parameter is usually the coupling constant and we want to have our
function for the positive values of coupling constant - moreover we want, for real
expansion coecients, the function to be real, at least close to zero. our aim is
therefore to nd a function which has not only the expansion (1) but is also real
on the positive semiaxis. we want to stress that such function is again not unique,
but we want to show how one of such functions can be constructed from (1).

we rst consider a case when the borel transform of the series has only poles
(section 2) and illustrate our point in section 3 by two examples of qcd related
series. then, in section 4, we apply our considerations to the case when the borel
transform has branchpoints and claim that the same approach (taking the principal
value of the borel integral over pade approximants to the borel transform of the
series) would work here - we support this claim by a simple numerical example.

1

2 poles in the borel transform

we consider the series:



f (z) =

fnzn

(3)

xn=0

where we expect that asymptotically (for n  ) fn behaves like n!k nn. the
borel transform of this series is then:

g(z) =

gnzn =



xn=0

fn
n!

zn



xn=0

(4)

if all fns are positive (which is often the case in qcd), then we can expect that
g(z) has a singularity at z = k (where k is the radius of convergence of (4)). in
this case the borel integral:

(z) = z 

0

eug(uz)du

(5)

is complex for z > 0, if it exists.
if g(z)(z  k) is nite for z  k, then this
singularity does not spoil the convergence of (5), and similiar conditions can be
imposed on the behaviour of g(z) near other singularities.

let us rst assume that g(z) has a simple pole at z = k. in this case:

lim
zk

g(z)(z  k) = res
z=k

g(z) < 

and the integral (5) can be written , for x(0, ) as:

(x) = p v z 

0

eug(ux)du 

i
x

ek/xres
x=k

g(x)

(6)

(7)

- choice of the sign depends on whether in (5) we integrate just below or just above
the positive semiaxis. we see that the imaginary part of (z) has all coecients
of the power expansion at z = 0+ vanishing and therefore:

e(x) = re(x) = p v z 

0

eug(ux)du

(8)

is the function we need for x > 0.

if we are frustrated by the fact that e(x) is dened only for x > 0, and is not

an analytic function in the complex plane, we can dene it also there:

e(z) = z +i

0+i

eug(uz)du +

i
z

ek/zres
x=k

g(x)

(9)

obviously we can proceed in an analogous way if g(z) has more poles on the

positive semiaxis. let us, for the moment, assume it has only poles there.

2

we now ask how can we construct a sequence of approximations to e(z) from
(3). we have already pointed out that the direct application of pa to (3) will most
probably fail, because we can expect that pa will diverge on the positive semiaxis.
however, as we know that pa are particularily ecient in approximating functions
in domains of their meromorphy [5], we can use pa to approximate g(z) from (4),
i.e. we propose to construct [m/n]g(z) and approximate e(z) by:

em,n (z) = p v z 

0

eu[m/n]g(uz)du

(10)

the convergence of pa in measure in the neighbourhood of the positive semiaxis
(where we assumed g(z) to be meromorphic, and therefore we expect this type of
convergence) guarantees us that (10) will converge to (8). we want to point out
that the idea of combining pa with the borel method was proposed quite a time
ago [6],[7], but in a context where the borel transform was regular on the positive
semiaxis. essentially the same concept was used in [8], where the partial pade
approximant [9] was used to predict a sum of the series for the gell-mann-low
function of the eective charge.

before we consider a more general situation when g(z) has also branch points
on the positive semiaxis, let us see how the method works for two examples from
qcd.

3 two qcd series with only poles on the positive

semiaxis

first, we consider the bjorken sum rule.
it is known [10] that in the large-0
approximation it has only four simple poles in the borel plane and therefore our
prescription would be exact for all [m/n] with m  3 and n  4. for realistic
values of 0, the perturbation series has been calculated up to 3rd order and there
exists an estimate for the next coecient [11]. it has been demonstrated in [11] that
[2/1] pa to the borel transform of the truncated series for f (x) (we take nf = 3):

f (x) = 1  x  3.58x2  20.22x3  130x4

where f(x)is dened in:

z 

0

[gp

1(x, q2)  gn

1 (x, q2)]dx =

1
6

| ga | f (s/)

(11)

(12)

exhibits a pole at y = 1.05 (y = 0
4
large-0 limit, as mentioned above. therefore we believe that

s
 ), while we expect poles at 1, 2 in the

f (z) = 1  zp v z 

0

eu[2/1]s(u

0
4

z)du

(13)

3

is a reasonable approximation to f (z) (for the exact denition of s see [11]). we
shall not discuss this example in more depth, but only remark that the value of
s(q2 = 3gev 2) found this way is .371+.075
.068.

the next example, which we want to discuss in detail, is the asymptotic series
for the running coupling constant obtained from the static qcd potential for which
we take the richardson potential [12]. we follow notations and conventions of [13],
and for more clarity we shall cite some formulae from this paper.

the richardson potential in momentum space is:

vr(q) = 

162cf

0q2ln(1 + q2/2

r)

(14)

and we use nf = 3, therefore 0 = 11  2/3nf = 9, also r = .4 and cf = 4/3.
this example is very instructive because one can nd the exact formula for the
perturbative coupling in the position space:

r(1/r) =

2

0 "1 z 

1

du
u

erru

ln2(u2  1) + 2#

at the same time the formula for the coupling in momentum space is:

r(q) =

4

0 "

1

ln(1 + q2/2

r)



2
r

q2 #

from this, one can calculate the  function:

r(r) = q2 r(q)

q2 = 

0
4

2

r +

0

4h 0

4  ri2

1 + q2/2
r

(15)

(16)

(17)

on the other hand, one has (for any potential) the expansion:

v (1/r) =

fn v (v )



v !n



xn=0

v (q = 1/r)

(18)

where r = ree , and e is eulers constant. fns are coecients of the expansion
of:

f (u) = s tan(u)

u

exp" 
xn=1

(2u)2n+1
2n + 1

(2n + 1)# =

fnun



xn=0

(19)

for details see [13].

for later considerations it will be useful to observe that f (u) can also be written

in a dierent form:

f (u) =

1

1  2u

1 + u
k
1  2u
2k+1



yk=1

4

(20)

from this formula we can immediately see that f(u) has zeros at negative integer
values of u and simple poles at half-integer positive values.

it is important to observe from (17) that r(r) is not analytic at r(q) = 0.

the reason is that r(q)  0 for q   and therefore:

r(r) = 

0
4

2

r + terms like

e 4

0 r

(21)

summing up, we see that we can get for r(1/r) the perturbation expansion when
we neglect higher twists:

pert

r (1/r) =

4 !n
r(q) 0r(q)

n!fn



xn=0

(22)

with q = 1/r. the direct calculation of pas to this series conrms our expectations:
the majority of zeros and poles of diagonal pas [m/m] (the same is the case for
paradiagonal sequences of the type [m  1/m]) lie on the positive semiaxis and
interlace:

we see that for large q (r small), there will be diculties in nding stable

values for pas, because of condensation of their zeros and poles.

when we now go to the borel plane we get the series which is just:

r(q)f (

0r(q)

4

)

(23)

however we know already (see (20)) that f(u) has only poles on the positive semi-
axis, and therefore we can try to sum (22) using the formula:

we see that pas to f (u) actually reconstruct zeros and poles on the real axis

7

and that there are many other complex zeros and poles drifting away from u = 0,
most probably simulating the essential singularity of f (u) at u = .

now we can see what values for (22) can one get from (24). we shall compare
these values with the ones obtained in [13] as the best partial sums (denoted by
r,n (1/r)), and those calculated from formula (15), though one must keep in mind,
that (15) gives the exact value of r in position space, while we are here estimating
the sum (22) which is (15) minus higher twists.

we present below the case m = n, but include also [2/3], as it is the lowest
pa which gives already values quite close to the limit and uses only ve coecients
of the expansion.

we see that r(1/r)m,m converge when m grows, but not to the values of r
- we attribute this to the dierence made by higher twists. in other words we

8

claim that the procedure we propose sums the series (22) well, which allows us
to see clearly the dierence between the perturbative solution - represented by
this series - and the full solution (15) including also nonperturbative eects. we
demonstrate, therefore, once again the fact that the perturbation series contains
only a part of the information about the full solution and that the requirement
that the solution must be real for positive values of the coupling constant is not
sucient to compensate for the information contained in higher twists terms.

4 branch points in the borel transform

if the borel transform has a branchpoint at z = k, instead of a pole, then the
integral (5) for x(0, ) instead of (7) takes the form:

(x) = z 

0

eureg(ux)du  iz 

k/x

euimg(ux)du

(25)

if g(z)(z  k) is nite for z  k (what is a condition for the existence of (5).

again, we see that the second integral, which is equal to the imaginary part of (x),
has all terms of the asymptotic expansion for x = 0+ vanishing, and therefore it is
the rst integral which is of interest for us.

in the same way, as in the case of the simple pole, we can nd an integral
representation for the analytic function having the required asymptotic expansion
(3) and being real on the positive semiaxis:

e(z) = z +i

0+i

eug(uz)du 

1

2z z 

k

eu/z[g(u + i)  g(u  i)]du

(26)

these facts were also observed earlier [14], but we want to stress that re(x) has

the same asymptotic expansion at zero as (x) and therefore it cannot be reliably
estimated by calculation of partial sums.

if we want now to use the same concept as before: to sum (4) using pas, we
must remember that they will most probably not converge on semiaxis x(k, ).
we conjecture, however, that if pas to g(z) converge in measure arbitrarily close
to positive semiaxis (where we expect a cut, reconstructed by pas, should lie),
then the integral:

will converge to re(z) (see (25)) for z0.
to check a plausibility of this hypothesis, we try to calculate this way:

eu[m/n]g(uz)du

e(z)m,n = p v z 

0

f (x) = rez 

0

eu/xlog(1  u)du

9

(27)

(28)

i.e. we approximate f (x) by:

fm,n (x) = p v z 

0

eu/xu[m/n]log(1t)/t(u)du

(29)

as log(1  t)/t is the stieltjes function, all poles of pas to it lie on the semiaxis

(1, ) and interlace with zeros [3],[4].

on the other hand, f (x) can easily be converted to a simple principal value

integral:

f (x) = xp v z 

0

eu/x
1  u

du

(30)

we give below values of fm,n (x) for few values of x and compare them with

values obtained from a numerical integration of the last formula.

it sholud be noticed that starting from [8/8] the quadruple precision was nec-

essary to obtain the above numbers.

5 conclusions

we have proposed above to use pas to sum the borel transforms of the series
appearing in qcd, and then to calculate cauchy principal value of the borel
integral to obtain a function which has the given series as its asymptotic expansion
at zero, and which is at the same time real on the positive semiaxis in the complex

10

coupling constant plane. the proposal is not entirely new [8], but we have pointed
out that it produces values of the well dened analytic function, one of the variety of
them having the same asymtotic expansion. we have also argued that the method
should work not only in the case when the borel transform has poles on the positive
semiaxis, but also when it has branchpoints there. this latter point is illustrated
by the very simple numerical experiment.
