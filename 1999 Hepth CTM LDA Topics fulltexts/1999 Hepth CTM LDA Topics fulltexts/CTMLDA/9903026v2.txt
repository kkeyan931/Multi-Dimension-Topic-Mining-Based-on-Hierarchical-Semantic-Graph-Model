abstract

we discuss a solution of the equations of motion of ve-dimensional gauged type iib

supergravity that describes conning su(n) gauge theories at large n and large
t hooft parameter. we prove connement by computing the wilson loop, and we
show that our solution is generic, independent of most of the details of the theory.

in particular, the einstein-frame metric near its singularity, and the condensates of
scalar, composite operators are universal. also universal is the discreteness of the

glueball mass spectrum and the existence of a mass gap. the metric is also identical
to a generically conning solution recently found in type 0b theory.

1 introduction

the duality between supergravity theories and strongly coupled eld theories at large n and

large t hooft parameter [1] applies both to conformal [2, 3, 4] and non-conformal eld theories [5,
6].

in order to be able to trust the supergravity approximation, one nds, quite generally, that
the t hooft coupling, x = ng2
y m , must be large. in non-conformally invariant theories, where
x runs, this is to be understood as x at the ultraviolet cuto. this means that the dynamical
regime of gauge theories that can be described via supergravity duals is not the usual one, where
x  1 at the uv cuto. nevertheless, it is believed that strongly-coupled gauge theories share
some qualitative properties with their weakly coupled relatives; in particular, connement and
mass gap [6]. this belief has given rise to a blossoming of works where (super)gravity solutions

are found, that describe higher-dimensional gauge theories compactied to 4-d [7], deformations
of n=4 4-d supersymmetric gauge theories [8], and deformations of non-supersymmetric confor-

mal theories [9, 10]. in latter example, the dual of the strongly-coupled gauge theory is a type
0, non-supersymmetric string theory.

a question posed by the existence of so many dierent ways of obtaining theories that are
expected to have the same infrared behaviour is whether there exists a framework that allows
to describe all the conning solutions at once. a slightly less ambitious objective is to nd a

framework that describes generically conning deformations of n=4, 4-d super yang-mills.

in this paper, we describe such framework: 5-d gauged supergravity. we nd a generic,

universal solution of the equations of motion of gauged supergravity, that does not depend on
the detailed form of its action. our results exceed our expectations. indeed, we nd that, in

our solution, the generic ir behaviour of the metric is universal, and agrees not only with all
known conning solutions of type iib supergravity, corresponding to softly broken n=4 super

yang-mills, but also with solutions of type 0 supergravity.

our scenario has some similarities with the one proposed in [11, 12] for describing the
universality class of conning strings, using ve-dimensional non critical string theories. as a

matter of fact our solution agrees in the ir with the one found in [11] for the simplest background
with only the metric and the dilaton.
it would be interesting to check if more complicated

conning solutions, obtained by non-critical string theories, have the same ir behaviour as the
one found in this paper.

we discuss the main features of our solution, as discreteness of the glueball mass spectrum
and the existence of a mass gap. we present the computation of the string tensions and of the

wilson loop, and, in a concrete example, we show explicitly the area law for the quark-antiquark
wilson loop. we also nd a general formula for condensates of scalar composite operators. this
formula depends only on the near-singularity form of the metric.

1

this paper is organised as follows. in section 2, we describe the general model-independent

results of our analysis. this section describes the computation of the near-singularity metric,
wilson loop, glueball mass spectrum, and condensates. section 3 applies the formalism of

section 2 to a specic example in 5-d gauged supergravity. section 4 contains our conclusions.
technical aspects of the computations in sections 2 and 3 are conned to two appendices.

2 general results

the four-dimensional n=4 su(n) super yang-mills theory is a superconformal eld theory
whose supergravity dual is type iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5 [2]. type iib
supergravity contains all deformations of n=4, with dimensions that remain nite in the large-
x limit; they were found in [13]. some of these deformations also exist in type iib dimensionally
reduced to ve dimensions on ads5  s5, that is, in 5-d gauged n=8 supergravity [14, 15].

gauged n=8 supergravity has gauge group su(4) and 42 scalars. by the ads/cft corre-

spondence, these scalars correspond to deformations of the n=4 super yang-mills theory with
dimension 2, 3, and 4. the scalar potential of 5-d gauged supergravity has several stationary

points. all stationary points that satisfy the breitenlohner-freedman stability bound [16] cor-
respond to local, unitary, four-dimensional conformal eld theories. some of these stationary
points have been studied in [17, 18, 19].

it is widely believed that each solution of the equations of motion of 5-d gauged supergravity
can be promoted to a solution of 10-d type iib supergravity. arguments in favour of this

statement can be found in [17, 19, 20]; moreover, this is a theorem in the largely analogous case
of 4-d gauged so(8) supergravity [21].

in a previous paper [17], we went beyond the study of conformal xed points, and we found
solutions of 5-d gauged supergravity that interpolate between two stationary points of the scalar
potential. the 5-d metric of such solutions has two asymptotically-ads5 regions, describing the
uv and ir conformal xed points of the gauge theory.

in this paper, instead, we want to nd solutions of 5-d gauged supergravity with only one
asymptotically-ads5 region, corresponding to the uv n=4 super yang-mills su(n) theory.
we will nd that the ir behaviour of this metric is universal.

we are looking for a metric that preserves 4-d poincare invariance. this restricts its form

to

ds2 = dy2 + e2(y)dxdx,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

(1)

we always work in the 5-d einstein frame; ads5 with radius r corresponds to  = y/r + const.
as in [17], we associate larger energies with increasing y. this means that we must look for
solutions that approach ads5 when y  .

2

we also allow for a y-dependence in some of the 42 scalars we have in our theory. the

boundary conditions for the scalars is that they approach the so(6), n=8 invariant stationary
point. this means that for y   the dilaton is a constant, while all the other scalars vanish.
at large y, the behaviour of the scalars and the einstein metric is complicated and non-

universal, but their infrared behaviour is universal, for a wide class of solutions.

the 5-dimensional supergravity action for scalar elds coupled to the metric (1) reduces to

l = g" r

4

+

(ya)2 + v (a)# .

1

2 xa

(2)

here we have assumed canonical kinetic term for all scalars. this can always be achieved by an
appropriate eld redenition. as we shall see shortly in our concrete example, the kinetic term

is already canonical with a standard choice of variables. einsteins equations and the equations
of motion of the scalars following from (2) are:

2
y a + 4y ya =

v
a ,

6(y)2 = xa

(ya)2  2v.

(3)

eqs. (3) have a universal runaway solution, independent of the detailed form of the potential.

it is quite similar to the singular instanton solution found by hawking and turok [22]. namely,
let us assume that near y = a the scalar elds and the metric diverge such that the potential
term in eqs. (3) is irrelevant. then, one nd a universal behaviour for both  and a near
y = a:

a = k a log |y  a| + constant,  =

1
4

log |y  a| + constant, x k a 2 =

3
8

.

the metric, in particular, has a solution-independent behaviour:

ds2 = dy2 + |y  a|1/2dxdx.
for notational simplicity, we will put a = 0 in the following.

(4)

(5)

the assumption that the potential is irrelevant is justied whenever v is polynomial in
a. in gauged supergravity, typically, when scalars are canonically normalised, the potential is
exponential in some of them. this means that the constants k a in eq. (3) must obey some
model-dependent inequalities.

eq. (5) agrees with the behaviour of the 5-d einstein-frame metric found in refs. [8, 10].
agreement with ref. [8] is encouraging, since that paper studies a deformation of type iib theory
on ads5s5; i.e. a model that falls into the class we are studying. more surprising is agreement
with ref. [10]. after all, that paper studies a compactication of the non-supersymmetric type 0
superstring. moreover, the form of the metric also agrees with that found in [11], using general

arguments based on ve-dimensional non-critical string theories, for a background with only the

3

metric and the dilaton4. the common behaviour of the ir metric in all these dierent cases,
type iib, type 0 and non-critical strings, has a technical reason: all these models can be reduced
to some eective theory for ve-dimensional scalars. the fact that in all these theories one nds

the same singularity in the metric may mean that the result we obtained is truly universal, and
largely insensitive to the uv theory used to derive the ir conning behaviour.

we now discuss what are the characteristics of solutions that describe conning theories. the
asymptotic behaviour in eq. (5) does not completely specied the model. we must give the
expressions for the tensions of the fundamental string and of the dirichlet string. since we made

several weyl rescaling with the purpose of reducing the ten-dimensional equations of motion
in the string frame to the ve-dimensional einstein frame, we expect that the ve-dimensional

tensions depend on the supergravity scalars. these tensions are, in general, model-dependent.
we compute below the tensions for a particular solution. however, from the computational

details for the specic solution and the form of the ve-dimensional supergravity, we expect
if we single out the particular scalar 0 as the
a general power behaviour for the tensions.

ve-dimensional dilaton, we have,

tf 1 = yp dak ak 0

, td1 = yp dak a+k 0

,

(6)

where the coecients da depend on the specic model. this behaviour is in agreement with that
found in ref. [8, 10]. equipped with this result, we can study whether the theory connes by

computing a wilson loop, according to the original proposal in [23]. the wilson loop associated
to a given boundary contour c is obtained by minimising the classical action for a string free to
move in the ve-dimensional space but with endpoints on c. as reviewed in appendix a, the

knowledge of the asymptotic behaviour of the metric and the tensions is sucient for extracting
qualitative information about the wilson loop. the result is that, in the range of the allowed
values for k a, it is possible to nd dierent behaviours for the quark-antiquark potential, namely
connement as well as screening. however, connement is generic for this class of solutions, in
the sense that there is a large range of values of k a for which quarks conne and monopoles
are screened. this is similar to what found in [10]. we exhibit below the detailed calculation
in a specic example. moreover, as we will see, even if the numerical details about the range
of allowed values for k a are model-dependent, the physical picture is always the same. the
asymptotic behaviour of the metric (5) conspires with the form of the tensions (6) to create a

barrier for the fundamental string, which therefore cannot enter in the deep ir region. since
the string is forced to stay near to the boundary, an area law behaviour for the wilson loop is

expected [6].

4the relevant behaviour for this solution is determined by eq. (26) of [11]. notice that we want to interpret

 = 0 not as the boundary, as in [11], but as the ir, as in the ads-revised philosophy discussed in [12].

4

some comments about the validity of the solution are in order. since the metric and the ki-

netic terms for scalars blow up in the ir, we expect that the supergravity solution is signicantly
corrected by the higher derivatives terms in the lagrangian. this problem is common to all the

proposed supergravity solutions for conning theories [8, 10]. we may expect that corrections
are mildened by the fact that the weyl tensor vanishes for our background [9]. moreover, it was

shown in [10], which contains solutions closely related to ours, that there exist particular values
of the parameters for which the corrections are suppressed. in the best of possible worlds, the
corrections will simply slightly change the range of parameters, and we saw that the physics

of our solution is not sensitive to such details. moreover, connement is obtained when the
fundamental string does not probe the far ir region, whose details become therefore irrelevant.

it is possible then that the particles wave-functions and the fundamental string world-sheet,
needed for computing the mass spectrum and the wilson loops, always live in a region where

curvature and higher derivatives terms are still under control.

we now discuss the existence of a mass gap and the glueball spectrum. this is done as in [6]

by looking for normalizable solutions of the equation of motion of a minimally coupled massless
scalar in the metric (1) the action of the scalar is

s = z 

0

dy(cid:16)e4|y|2 + k2e2||2(cid:17) , k2 = kk.

(7)

integrating by part eq. (7), and using the equation of motion and e4 = 0 at y = 0 we nd
s = 0 for the normalizable solution, which approaches a constant at y = 0. therefore, k2 must
be strictly negative, proving the existence of a mass gap. discreteness of the spectrum follows
from requiring normalizability at large y [6].

the equation of motion derived from action (7) is

 2

y   4y y + k2e2 = 0.

(8)

the spectrum of glueballs can be studied using a wkb approximation [24]. standard calcula-
tions lead to the following form for the wkb wave function:

(y) = c[2(y)  ip(y)]1/2e2(y)ir y
(y) = c [2(y) + |p(y)|]1/2e2(y)r a
(y) = c [2(y) + |p(y)|]1/2e2(y)r y

dyp(y),
dy|p(y)|,
dy|p(y)|,

0 < y < b

y < a,

y > b.

(9)

(10)

(11)

here, p(y) = qk2e2(y)  42

y(y), c, c , c  are constants, and a, b are the classical turning
points, p(a) = p(b) = 0. the existence of these points follow from the form of p(y) at small and

large y. at small y, it is:

p(y) = k2y1/2 

1

y2,

y  1.

(12)

5

notice that this expression is universal, since it depends only on the near-singularity metric in

eq. (5). at large y, p(y) is also universal, since there the metric approaches the ads form:
(y) = y; thus,

(13)
at y = 0, p(y) diverges to ; at intermediate y, p(y) is positive when k2 < 0; at large y, p(y)
becomes negative again. this proves the existence of turning points. as usual in the case of a

p(y) = k2e2y  4.

it is given by the bohr-sommerfeld quantisation rule [25]

y(y) = (n + ), en = k2,

(14)

with  a constant of order one. eq. (14) is the starting point for numerical and analytical studies

of the glueball spectrum. in this paper, though, we do not want to join this thriving cottage
industry;
instead, we want to exhibit general, model independent, features of supergravity

duals of gauge theories. thus, we shall abandon the study of the glueball spectrum, and discuss
another model-independent feature of our solution, namely, the existence of condensates.

the condensate of a eld theoretical operator oa that couples to the source a reads [3, 4]:

hoai =

s5d
a .

(15)

here s5d is the action of 5-d gauged supergravity, computed on the solution of the equations
of motion (3). thanks to the equations of motion, the right hand side of eq. (15) is a total
derivative:

hoai = (cid:20) 1

y(cid:21)

0

e4(y)mab()b

.

(16)

unlike in eq. (3), here we allow for a non-canonical kinetic term. whenever the potential v

can be neglected, the universal runaway solution in eq. (4) still holds. near y = 0 it reads

e4(y)mab()b

y = constant  ka.

(17)

in eq. (16) the upper boundary diverges at y =  and must be subtracted. this uv regular-
ization is determined by requiring that condensates vanish for geometries with two asymptotic
ads regions. in that case, the coordinate y runs from y =  to y = +, and the contribution
of the lower boundary to eq. (16) vanishes, while the contribution of the upper boundary is still
divergent. after uv regularization, eq. (16) reduces to a very simple form:

hoai =

1
2

ka.

(18)

notice that this formula for the condensate is independent of all the ne details of the metric, in
particular, its behaviour at large y. moreover, it is nite without any ad-hoc ir regularization,
and also gives a physical meaning to the constants of integration ka.

3 an example

let us apply now the machinery developed in the previous section to a specic example. a

simplied theory with only two scalars it is already enough to describe the general behaviour
of conning theories, and allows us to make contact with the solutions found in [8, 10].

it is easy to make contact with the solution found in [8] . we are studying the same problem
in the dimensionally reduced theory. the solution in [8] corresponds to a single running eld,

the ve-dimensional dilaton, which has zero potential [15]. we therefore expect an ir metric as
in eq. (5). a simple weyl rescaling indeed shows that the solution in [8] has the ir behaviour

given by eq. (5). the tensions also agree with the discussion in the previous section.

more general ten-dimensional solutions, corresponding to perturbations of ads5  s5 with
some other elds, and breaking the su(4) invariance, have not yet been found. these solutions

are quite natural to consider, since most of them correspond to perturbations of super n=4
yang-mills with mass terms for scalars and fermions. the technical diculty of nding a full

ten-dimensional solution can be easily overcome if we are interested in the less complete but
still quite interesting corresponding ve-dimensional solution. in ten dimensions, su(4) non-

invariant elds are automatically sources for the dilaton, which then starts to run. we can mimic
this solution in ve dimensions by considering the above equations of motions for two scalars,
the dilaton (which does not appear in the potential) and a scalar with a non-trivial potential.

we consider, for simplicity, the lucky case in which all other scalars can be consistently set
to zero. the solution in eq. (4) depends on two constants, k and k0, with the constraint
k 2 + k 2
0 = 3/8. a potential for , which in supergravity generally is of the asymptotic form
ec, is irrelevant if and only if

0 < ck < 2, k 2 + k 2

0 =

3
8

.

(19)

generically, this equation can be satised for certain values of k, in which case the ir metric
assumes the form given in eq. (5). we could also try to consider a solution with a xed value of

the dilaton. in this case, it is not obvious that the potential is irrelevant; it must happen that

cq 3

8 < 2 and, as we will see, this is not the case, in general.
the solutions found in [10] do not obviously fall in the class of examples we are considering;
indeed, they are not obtained from an n=4 uv xed point. the source for the dilaton is,

instead, a non-zero tachyon eld, which exists only in type 0 theories. however, the type 0
equations of motions also reduce to a certain lagrangian for a set of scalars with an eective
potential. under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the solution found in [10] has the

same generic ir behaviour as our solution.

to study a concrete example, let us consider a deformation of the n=4 yang-mills theory
that corresponds, in n=1 notations, to a mass term for the three chiral multiplets xi. the

7

theory ows in the ir to pure n=1 yang-mills, which connes. to obtain the standard n=1

pure yang-mills with xed scale  we need a ne tuning of the uv parameters, in which the
mass m diverges while the thooft coupling constant, x, goes to zero as a logarithm of m. this

is outside the regime of validity of supergravity, which requires a large x, but we may still expect
to see from supergravity the qualitative properties of the theory, as, for instance, connement.

the supergravity mode corresponding to a mass term for the chiral multiplets was identied
in [26]. the 42 scalars of the ve-dimensional supergravity transform as 1, 20, 10 under su(4).
the explicit form of the cft operators to which these supergravity elds couple can be found,

for example, in [17]. the mass term for the chiral multiplets appears in the decomposition
10  1 + 6 + 3 of su(4) under su(3)  u(1). a non-zero vev for the su(3) singlet contained
in this decomposition was studied in [17, 18]. it corresponds to a deformation of n=4 super
yang-mills that leads to a non-supersymmetric, conformal ir xed point. a non-zero vev for 6,
when represented as a complex symmetric matrix, mij, corresponds to the n=1 supersymmetric

mass deformation r d2mijxixj + c.c.. since we want to compute and to control the asymptotic

behaviour of the potential, we need to reduce the number of scalars which we turn on. if we
are not careful, a non-zero vev for the scalar m will induce non-zero vevs for other scalars as
well, due to the existence of linear couplings of m to the other elds in the potential. this
is indeed the case for generic mij. however, if we further impose so(3) symmetry, by taking
an mij proportional to the identity matrix, a simple group theory exercise shows that all the
remaining elds can be consistently set to zero.

the ve-dimensional action of the scalars, given in ref. [14], is written in terms of a 27  27
matrix u, transforming in the fundamental representation of e6 and parametrising the coset
e6/usp(8). u can be written as u = ex, x = pa ata, where, in a unitary gauge, ta are the

generators of e6 that do not belong to usp(8). this matrix has exactly 42 real independent
parameters, which are the scalars of the supergravity theory. the lagrangian has the form

l = g(cid:20)

r
4 

1
24

tr (u 1u)2 + v (u)(cid:21) .

(20)

since the rules for computing the potential were described in [15], and recently reviewed and

applied in [18, 19], here we will recall only the main points of the computation. first, one
chooses a convenient parametrisation for the coset manifold representative which makes the
kinetic terms canonical. a possible parametrisation, suitable for studying the breaking su(4) 
su(3)  u(1), has been extensively described in [18]. secondly, one performs some gamma-
matrix algebra. conventions, details and computational tricks can be found in ref. [15]. a

summary of the relevant formulae can be found in appendix b. the result for the diagonal
scalar mij is

(21)

l = g(cid:20)

r
4

3

8r2 (cosh2(2m) + 7)(cid:21) ,

where r is the curvature of ads5. the above potential passes two crucial checks: when expanded
for small m it reproduces the cosmological constant of the su(4) symmetric ads-vacuum, and
the mass for the scalar m which is, according to [13], 3/r2, the right value to be the source of
a dimension-three operator in the cft. in any case, the asymptotic behaviour of the potential
can be gured out even without a detailed computation. with only one scalar and the above
form for u = emt , where t is a particular generator of e6, suitably normalised, the kinetic term
is automatically canonical. moreover, the potential is quartic in u making quite plausible the
asymptotic behaviour  e4m.

if we turn on only the eld m, and implement the constraint in eq. (19), we easily discover
that the potential cannot be neglected, and, therefore, the solution in eq. (3) does not describe
well the ir physics. this is due to the fact that the power of em in the potential is too large.
as we already discussed, this problem can be easily circumvented by turning on other scalars.

the natural choice is to turn on the dilaton. we will call  the ve-dimensional dilaton. it
has a canonical kinetic term 1
2()2, and it does not appear in the potential. it is not obvious
whether the ve-dimensional solution preserves n=1 supersymmetry, as one may naively think.
the solution with only the dilaton was argued to break all supersymmetries in [8]. it is possible
that some particular solution with non-zero elds m and  preserves n=1 supersymmetry; the

safe way to check this is to look at the supersymmetry variations of the fermions. however, here
we are not really interested in an n=1 solution. rather, we want to prove that for a generic,

not necessarily supersymmetric solution, the ir behaviour is universal, and that connement
is expected for a large range of values of the parameters ka, without requiring ne tuning.
the non-zero dilaton induces some other so(6) invariant deformations of the n=4 uv xed
point. beside the obvious f 2
 term, the only other so(6)-invariant supergravity eld that
may appear is f 4. this is however irrelevant at the uv xed point and does not explain the
solution in [8]. it was argued in the second paper in ref. [8] that the usually neglected non-
chiral operators, like the diagonal mass term for the six scalars of the n=4 theory, may be

also induced as deformations of the n=4 uv xed point by the running dilaton solution, and
that they may play a role in the eld theory interpretation, despite their innite anomalous
dimension5. whether or not we accept this interpretation, the solution with non-zero dilaton
and non-zero scalar m is reasonably associated to a deformation of n=4 super yang-mills, that

renders massive at least all the scalars and fermions in the chiral multiplets. in a genuine n=1
theory, the gaugino will remain massless to give pure n=1 yang-mills. in a non supersymmetric

5with a deformation of the formr d2mxixi + c.c., we nd in the lagrangian also a diagonal mass term for
the six scalars of the n=4 theory, quadratic in the parameter m, and, therefore, not seen in a linearization in
m. the cft operator associated to the supergravity scalar m is obtained by linearizing around the ads5  s 5
solution, and it will never see the quadratic term. the appearance of this non-chiral operator at the second
order may be an hint for the inclusion of stringy state, or simply due to an operator mixing.

theory it will probably become massive. in any case, we reasonably expect a conning theory

in the ir.

to prove connement we need to compute the wilson loop and show that it exhibits an

area law. we rst need to compute the string tension in ve dimensions. the tension of the
fundamental string (or the d1-string) can be read from the coecient of the kinetic term for

the ns-ns (or r-r) antisymmetric tensor in the ten dimensional lagrangian in the einstein
frame,

(22)

a simple weyl rescaling shows that this property is valid also in the ve-dimensional theory

in the einstein frame. we need, therefore, the kinetic terms of the antisymmetric tensors
in the ve-dimensional supergravity. the ve-dimensional lagrangian has a global sl(2; r)

symmetry, which helps in identifying the various types of strings. there are 12 antisymmetric
tensors bi
 , i = 1, ..., 6,  = 1, 2, transforming in the 6 of su(4), and in the two-dimensional
representation of sl(2; r). we interpret the index i as signalling that our ve-dimensional
string remembers its ten-dimensional origin. the position of the string on the ve-sphere,
indeed, must be specied in a bona-de ten-dimensional computation. we will consider the
case in which the kinetic terms for bi are diagonal in i. the second index, , species a whole
multiplet of strings transforming under sl(2; r), as it is expected from the s-duality of n=4

super yang-mills. the antisymmetric-tensor kinetic term was written in [15] in a rst order
formalism:

bi  dbi + ai,jbi  bj.

(23)

ai,j is a symmetric matrix which depends on the scalars and whose explicit expression is
given in appendix b.

the problem of writing down the bps formula, which relates the tension of the strings
to their charges, is non trivial, especially in a gauged supergravity, where the elds bi are
massive.
in this paper we are taking the quite plausible point of view of believing that the
ve-dimensional sl(2; r) is the same as the ten-dimensional one and it is broken to sl(2; z)

by non-perturbative eects. we also trust naive dimensional reduction arguments from ten
dimensions6. for a diagonal matrix a we simply have

b1  db2 + a1|b1|2 + a2|b2|2.

(24)

now, if we choose one of the elds (say b1) and solve the equation of motion of b2, we can recover
6the general discussion in the previous section would not be aected by the discovery of the naivety of this
argument. and, for the particular example we are discussing, only few details would change; certainly not the
general conclusions.

a2|db1|2 + m|b1|2.

(25)

when a is not diagonal, one must be careful in going from the rst order formalism to the
second order one. one can easily see that the square-root of the eigenvalues of the matrix ai,j,
restricted to diagonal sl(2, r) indices, gives the tensions of the strings. in the parametrisation

used in this paper, the square of the tension of the fundamental string is given by an eigenvalue
of ai1j1, while the square of the tension of the d1-string is given by an eigenvalue of ai2,j2.
the matrix a is essentially the square of the matrix u; the precise formula is given in appendix
b. while the potential is independent of the dilaton, a crucially depends on it. it is easy to

compute the eigenvalues of a for the maximally supersymmetric vacuum corresponding to n=4
super yang-mills, when all the scalars but the dilaton are zero. the detailed computation can
be found in appendix b. the not surprising result is that the two eigenvalues of a, (a1, a2), are
exactly (e2, e2). the tensions can be computed without diculty even when other scalars are
non-zero. what one nds is that, due to the quadratic dependence on u, the contribution of
m to both tensions has the asymptotic form  em. this result is general enough, and predicts
tensions of the form (e(c/4)+, e(c/4)), where c is the (integer) constant appearing in the
asymptotic behaviour of the potential  ec.

we now summarise the characteristics of the model. first, we see that the potential behaves

as e4m. the allowed range of parameters, given by eq. (19), is

0 < k <

1
2

, k 2 + k 2

0 =

.

(26)

the ir behaviour of the metric is as in eq. (5), and the tensions for the fundamental and the

d1 strings are:

tf 1 = em+ = ykk0; td1 = em = yk+k0.

(27)

we are now ready to compute the wilson loop. the computation closely parallels that in

ref. [23]. the world-sheet action for a fundamental (or d1-) string in the background (1) is

s = z d dqgind = t z dxt (y)e(y)q(xy)2 + e2(y).

(28)

the wilson loop is obtained by minimising this action of a string whose endpoints span a

rectangle on the boundary of the space, with one side of length l in the direction x, and
another one of length t along the time axis. we choose the standard embedding  = x and

factorize the trivial integration in time. it is useful to change coordinates in such a way that
the quark-antiquark (or monopole-antimonopole) energy is

e = s/t = z dxq(xu)2 + f (u).

11

(29)

the change of variable and the function f (u) are given by

u
y

= t (y)e(y), f (u) = t 2(u)e4(u).

(30)

the computation of the wilson loop for generic metrics has been widely discussed in the liter-
ature [23, 27, 28, 10]. here we give a short review of what is expected about the wilson loop

behaviour, once the function f (u) has been specied (more details can be found in appendix
a). the boundary of the space is u = + and the asymptotic behaviour of f (u) near the
boundary, f (u)  u4, is obtained from the ads5 uv metric. the metric can be regular in the
ir region, or it can extend only up to some point u = a, if there is a horizon or, as in our case,
if the metric has a singularity. for notational simplicity we consider a = 0. if the function

f (u) has a minimum at a nite point, u, the fundamental string will then nd energetically
favourable to end at u without entering in the deep ir region. under these circumstances, we

expect an area law for the wilson loop [6, 10]. if instead the function f (u) is monotonic in the
ir, dierent behaviours may be expected; they are reviewed in appendix a. it may happen
that f (u) behaves as u4 both in the uv and in the ir, but with dierent coecients. this is the
case for the rg ow between dierent xed points considered in [17, 18]. another interesting
possibility, which will be very important for us, is the behaviour f (u)  u, 0 <  < 2. in this
case the string goes straight to the point u = 0, continues for a distance l along x, and returns
back to u = . since f (0) = 0, it does not cost any energy to separate the quark at u = 0.
this corresponds to electric (or magnetic) screening [27, 28].

let us apply these results to our solution. using the coordinates in eq. (30), we nd for the

function f (u), in the case of a pair of quarks and a pairs of monopoles, respectively,

fq q(u)  u

12(k+k0)

5/4(k+k0) , fm m(u)  u

12(kk0 )
5/4(kk0 ) .

(31)

it is easy to check that, in the allowed range of values for the constants k and k0, given in
eq. (26)7, fq q diverges while fm m  u with 0 <  < 2. this means that, in our solution, the
theory connes for all values of k and k0. there is a linear potential for quarks, and monopoles
are screened. since connement is obtained when the fundamental string does not probe the
far ir region, most of the details of the solution are therefore irrelevant. provided that the

function f (u) diverges in the ir, no matter how, connement is guaranteed.

the form of the solution we found is quite similar to that found in [10]8. a dierence with
7we are taking k0 > 0. the case k0 < 0 is clearly related to the one discussed here by an s-duality.
8we can easily make contact with the generic ir solution in [10]. it depends on three parameters subject
to a constraint. upon reduction to ve dimensions, the metric has, indeed, the form of eq. (5), and does not
depend on any parameter. two parameters are needed to specify the tensions of the fundamental string and the
dirichlet string. the relation between our parameters and those in [10] is k = 5 1/22
. with
152
this parametrisation, the quadratic constraint that we nd is slightly dierent from the one in [10]. this is not
surprising since we are dealing with type iib and ref.
[10] with type 0. we are claiming that the form of the
solution is universal; certainly details are not.

, k0 =  0

152

12

ref. [10] is that we nd connement for all values of the parameters. this is expected from the

physical interpretation as a mass deformation of n=4 super yang-mills. more general solutions,
as the one in [10], for instance, which exhibit electric connement or screening according to

dierent values for the parameters, can be easily accommodated by considering more scalars or
a dierent potential.

4 conclusions

in this paper, we have found a very satisfying and novel form of infrared universality for super-
gravity duals of strongly coupled gauge theories. specically, we have found that, generically,

there exists a runaway solution of the coupled scalar-einstein equations of motion of 5-d type
iib gauged supergravity. gauged 5-d supergravity is a convenient and general framework to

study deformations of n=4 super yang-mills theories in the limit of large t hooft parameter.
the runaway solution we described is universal and independent of the detailed form of the

supergravity action. it gives a universal (singular), 5-d metric and universal formulae for the
string tensions and scalar condensates. this universality explains why many examples of con-

ning duals of 4-d gauge theories share common properties. it is also encouraging in that it
may mean that even for small t hooft parameter, some generic properties of the supergravity
approximation to gauge theories, as connement and mass gap, can survive string corrections.

appendix a: generalities about the wilson loop

in this appendix we review the wilson loop calculation of refs. [23, 27, 28, 10].

we use coordinates in which the energy of a pair of heavy quark is

e = s/t = z dxq(xu)2 + f (u).

(a.1)

in the ads5 case, we have f (u) = u4. the ads5 boundary is at u = , while the singularity
is at u = 0. the wilson loop is obtained by minimising the corresponding action for a string
world-sheet which has a boundary at u = . we can take a rectangle at the boundary of the

13

space, with one side of length l in the direction x and another one of length t along the time

axis. we choose the standard embedding  = x, and we factorize the trivial integration in time.
in the conformal ads5 case, the wilson loop is not proportional to the boundary area since
the function f (u) is much smaller inside ads5 and it is energetically favourable for the string
to go inside ads5. if, for any reason such as a horizon, which introduces a cuto, as is the
case of theories at nite temperature, or a barrier the string cannot extend far enough from
the boundary, we expect an area law and connement.

consider now a general metric corresponding to a uv non-trivial xed point. the boundary
of the space is u = + and the asymptotic behaviour of the function f (u)  u4 near the
boundary is obtained from the ads5 uv metric. the metric may be regular in the ir region
or extend only up to some point u = a if there is a horizon or, as in our case, if the metric has
a singularity. for notational simplicity we consider a = 0.

the action in eq. (a.1) can be minimised as in [23]. dening u0 as the turning point of the

string, we have, exactly as in [23], two equations which implicitly give e as a function of l:

l
2

= z 
e = z 

u0

u0

du

,

r f (u)
f (u0)(f (u)  f (u0))
qf (u)
du
qf (u)  f (u0)  1
  1.


(a.2)

the derivation of these equations closely parallels that in ref. [23], and it will not be repeated
here. the divergent expression for the energy has been regularized as in [23] by subtracting the
innite contribution due to the mass of the heavy quarks.

this implicit equation for e(l) is hard to solve analytically. however, the main contribution
to the energy usually comes from the region around u0. the contribution from the large-u region
in the integral, where f (u)  u4, is always subtracted, since it diverges.

consider rst the case in which f (u) is monotonic. under the assumption that the integrals

are dominated by the region around u0, we get

l  s u0

f (u0)

, e  vuut

u0f (u0)
f (u0)

.

(a.3)

it may happen that f (u) behaves as u4 both in the uv and in the ir, but with dierent
coecients. this is the case for the rg ow between dierent xed points considered in [17, 18].
in this case, for l  , u0  1/l approaches the far ir region. the integrals are dominated
by the ir, which is still an ads5 space with a dierent radius. we are back to the computation
in [23] with a dierent radius for the space. we obviously nd that, for l  , e  u0  1/l,
as expected in a conformal theory.

14

it is interesting to consider the case in which f (u)  u, 0 <  < 2. since l  u1/2
,
we see that for small u0 l goes to zero. l goes to zero also for large u0, since, due to the
uv asymptotic form of f (u), the integral in eq. (a.2) is always convergent for u  . as
a consequence, l is a function of u0 bounded from above. at rst sight, there is no way to
probe the ir behaviour corresponding to l  . however, it was argued in [27, 28] that for
large enough l a dierent physical picture takes over. for large l, the string will go to the
point u = 0 along a straight line, proceed for a distance l along x and return to u = . since
f (0) = 0, it does not cost any energy to separate the quarks at u = 0. this corresponds to
electric (or magnetic) screening [27, 28].

0

consider now the case that f (u) is still monotonic but does not vanish in the ir. if f (u) 
const > 0, the integral in eq. (a.1) is certainly greater than l and we expect an area law
behaviour for the wilson loop [6]. this is the case, for example, of theories at nite temperature,
where there is a horizon at a nite ut . since u > ut , the string cannot extend far enough from
the boundary. in this case, we expect that the wilson loop will always grow at least as the
area [6]. this is indeed conrmed by the expression f  const + (u  ut )2 [27, 28]. we see that
u0 will approach the horizon.

beside the existence of a horizon, there is a second mechanism that prevents the string from
going far enough from the boundary. if the function f (u) diverges near u = 0, it will create a
barrier, giving rise to a conning behaviour for the wilson loop. f (u) will have a minimum at
a nite point u. assuming f (u) > 0, we have that f (u)  f (u) > 0. the fundamental string
will then nd energetically favourable to end at u without entering in the far ir region. under

these circumstances, we expect an area law for the wilson loop [6, 10]. we can explicitly check
the behaviour of the wilson loop. l automatically diverges if u0 approaches u. suppose that
f (u) = 0, f (u) 6= 0 the case in which the rst non-zero derivative is the k-th one is completely
analogous. from eqs. (a.2) we have:

appendix b: conventions and useful formulae for the
lagrangian

in this appendix we give the relevant formulae needed to compute the lagrangian in eq. (21).
since the tools for computing the potential have been already described in details in [15] and

recently reviewed in [18, 19], we do not aim to be self-contained but just to sketch the outline
of the computation. the reader may refer to the papers mentioned above for more details.

15

ref. [19], in particular, gives a nice short review of the philosophy behind these computations.
the ve-dimensional lagrangian for the scalars is written in terms of the 27  27 matrix u

parametrising the coset e6/usp(8)

l = g(cid:20) r
4 

1
24

tr (u 1u)2 + v (u)(cid:21) .

in a unitary gauge, u can be written as

u = exp x,

(b.1)

(b.2)

where x = pa ata is given by the 42 generators of e6 that do not belong to usp(8): these

42 independent parameters correspond to the 42 scalars. the precise form of the generator

corresponding to a given scalar can be worked out using the global and local symmetries of the
problem, and the fact that u maps an element of the representation 27 of e6 into itself. more
precisely, one has to remember that only the group su(4)  sl(2; r) is a symmetry of the
lagrangian. the 42 scalars then decompose according to

42  20

(0) + 10(2) + 10(2) + 1(4) + 1(4),

while the vectors in the 27 decompose as

27  15(0) + 6(2) + 6(2).

(b.3)

(b.4)

the subscripts denote the charges of the u(1) factor in sl(2; r).

the general parametrisation for u is given by eqs. (a.36) of [15], with the following conven-
tions for the indices: the 27 of e6 is represented by a couple of antisymmetric symplectic-traceless
indices a, b, running form 1 to 8, and, in the su(4)  sl(2; r) basis, it decomposes as

27  15 + (6, 2),
[ab]  ([ij], i)

(b.5)

with i, j = 1, . . . , 6 indices of su(4) and  = 1, 2 indices of sl(2; r). the brackets mean that

the indices are antisymmetrized.

if one is interested, as we are, in breaking the su(4) factor to su(3) u(1), a more suitable

parametrisation for u is given in [18], with the following basis for the 27:

27  (cid:16)1(0,0), 3(4,0), 3(4,0), 8(0,0), 3(2,2), 3(2,2), 3(2,2), 3(2,2)(cid:17) .

(b.6)

this time the subscripts indicate the charges under the u(1)  su(4) and the u(1)  sl(2; r),
respectively.

16

in our example, we turn on the dilaton eld, , and the scalars m in the 6(2,2) of su(4).

from ref. [18], the matrix u has the form

u = ex0ex,

(b.8)
the potential and the tensions of the fundamental string and of the d1-string are all given in
ab, where a, b are a couple of antisymmetric symplectic-traceless indices
terms of the vielbein vab
a, b = 1, ..., 8, and representing the 27 of usp(8). this eld, being an element of e6/usp(8),
carries both the indices a, b = 1, . . . , 8 of the 27 of e6 and the indices a, b = 1, . . . , 8 of the 27
of usp(8). one can pass from the e6 basis to the usp(8) one using the so(7) gamma matrices,
, dened in the appendix of [15].

in our basis the vielbein is simply obtained by multiplying on the right the matrix u by the

following vector of gamma matrices:

(b.9)

here the complex indices i, run from 1 to 3, and the new complex gamma matrices, i and

, are related to the real matrices of [15] by

1 =

1 + i22
1  i22

, . . .

, . . . .

(b.10)

(b.11)

the computation of the potential is now only a matter of straightforward gamma matrix algebra:
just plug vab

ab in the expression for the potential [15]

where

v =

(b.12)

(b.13)

in these equations the usp(8) indices are raised and lowered with the matrix 0, as shown in
ref. [15].

two features of the potential are worth mentioning. first, the potential does not depend on
the dilaton, since the factors involving exp x0 cancel out. moreover, the potential is quartic in
the matrix u; therefore, one expects an asymptotic dependence on the eld m of the form

v  e4m.

similarly, the kinetic terms for the 12 antisymmetric tensors bi

 are [15]

consider here the simpler case where only the dilaton is turned on. this has some interest
in itself since for the theory at the n=8 supersymmetric vacuum all scalars but the dilaton are

can be read from the restricted matrices ai1,j1 and ai2,j2. not surprising, the eigenvalues are

antisymmetric tensors, but not their kinetic term. the result for the tensions, is em+, em.
we see that the contribution of the scalar is the same for both type of tensions, and, due to the
fact that a is quadratic in u, has the asymptotic form em. this result applies to other scalars
as well.
