abstract

a generalization of the ferbershirafuji formulation of superparticle mechanics is con-
sidered. the generalized model describes the dynamics of a superparticle in a superspace
extended by tensorial central charge coordinates and commuting twistorlike spinor variables.
the d = 4 model contains a continuous real parameter a  0 and at a = 0 reduces to the
su (2, 2|1) supertwistor ferbershirafuji model, while at a = 1 one gets an osp(1|8) super-
twistor model of ref. [1] which describes bps states with all but one unbroken target space
supersymmetries. when 0 < a < 1 the model admits an osp(2|8) supertwistor descrip-
tion, and when a > 1 the supertwistor group becomes osp(1, 1|8). we quantize the model
and nd that its quantum spectrum consists of massless states of an arbitrary (half)integer
helicity. the independent discrete central charge coordinate describes the helicity spectrum.
we also outline the generalization of the a = 1 model to higher spacetime dimensions
and demonstrate that in d = 3, 4, 6 and 10, where the quantum states are massless, the
extra degrees of freedom (with respect to those of the standard superparticle) parametrize
compact manifolds. these compact manifolds can be associated with higherdimensional
helicity states. in particular, in d = 10 the additional helicity manifold is isomorphic to
the sphere s 7.

introduction

in a recent paper [1] two of the present authors proposed a new superparticle model with tensorial
central charges [2][8] and auxiliary fundamental spinor variables. an interesting peculiar feature
of this model is that it describes a superparticle whose presence breaks only one of targetspace
supersymmetries.
in all previously known cases superparticles and (in general) superbranes
break half or more supersymmetries of a target superspace vacuum.

as we shall show in this paper the model of [1] describes an innite tower of massless particles

of arbitrary (half)integer helicities.

in an analogous way the superparticle model of [1] admits the description in terms of

the model can be regarded as an extension of a ferbershirafuji formulation [9, 10] of d = 4
superparticle mechanics. in the framework of the n = 1 ferbershirafuji model one performs,
at the classical level, the twistor transform [9, 10] from the n = 1, d = 4 superspace description
of massless superelds to their description in terms of supertwistors forming a fundamental
representation of a superconformal group su (2, 2|1).
osp(1|8) supertwistors [11, 12].
the supergroups su (2, 2|1) and osp(1|8) are not subgroups of each other, but they are
dierent subgroups of the supergroup osp(2|8). hence, one can assume that the ferbershirafuji
model and the model [1] are dierent reductions of an osp(2|8) supertwistor model.
in this paper we construct such a generic n = 1, d = 4 superparticle action which depends
on a numerical nonnegative real parameter a. when the value of a varies within the interval
0 < a < 1 the model admits an osp(2|8) supertwistor description, while a = 0 and a = 1 are
two critical points. at a = 0 the model reduces to the ferbershirafuji superparticle. and at
a = 1 one arrives at the osp(1|8) supertwistor model of ref. [1].
symmetries, while at a = 1 only one supersymmetry is broken.

for all values of a except for a = 1 the superparticle breaks half of the targetspace super-

when a > 1 the supertwistor group becomes osp(1, 1|8) which contains a noncompact group
so(1, 1) as a subgroup instead of so(2) in the case of osp(2|8).
the (super)twistor formulation of relativistic (super)particle dynamics is useful in many
aspects. let us recall that, since the relativistic (super)particle is a constrained dynamical
system not all its dynamical variables are independent. by performing (super)twistor transform
we deal directly with independent physical degrees of freedom of the (super)particle in a covariant
way. this, for instance, simplies the quantization procedure and the analysis of the spectrum
of quantum states of the model.

we perform the quantization of the generic superparticle model for arbitrary values of the
parameter a and nd that in d = 4 rstquantized states of the superparticle form an innite
tower of massless states of a (half)integer helicity. we thus demonstrate that an extra dynamical
(central charge) coordinate in the model under consideration has the physical meaning of a spin
variable. this allows one to admit that the model considered might be related to the higherspin
eld theory of vasiliev [13] (see also relevant papers [14]).

we rst quantize the superparticle in the supertwistor formulation where the quantization
is almost straightforward since at a 6= 0 the supertwistor model is unconstrained and at a = 0
there is only one rstclass constraint.
we then quantize the model in the n = 1, d = 4 superspace extended with the tensorial
central charge coordinates, and show that the resulting spectrum of the quantum physical states
coincides with that of the supertwistor formulation.

since in this formulation the model contains second class constraints our main tool in carrying
out the quantization procedure will be the extension of the model in such a way that all the
constraints of the initial model become rst class constraints. this method, which can be traced
back to the papers by faddeev & shatashvili [15, 16], batalin, fradkin & fradkina [17, 18] and

1

egorian & manvelian [19] has already been applied to the quantization of standard massless
superparticles by moshe [20] and eisenberg & solomon [21, 22, 23]. the main advantage of this
method is that it allows one to avoid problems with covariant splitting fermionic constraints
into rst and second class ones. the initial formulation of the model is recovered when we
gauge x additional gauge symmetries (associated with new rstclass constraints) by putting
the conversion variables to zero.
in its nature the conversion method is related to an old
stueckelberg formalism [24] which extends the theory of massive vector elds with an auxiliary
scalar gauge degree of freedom.

the quantization of the model at a = 1 has additional peculiarities. in this case superparticle
dynamics is subject to only one secondclass constraint, which is quite unusual. dynamical
systems with the odd number of fermionic second class constraints are rather rare. one of few
known examples is a superparticle in d = 2 superspace with a single chiral fermion direction
[27]. so the quantization of such systems is an interesting exercise by itself which requires one
to deal with a single cliordlike variable.
in the case under consideration we shall use an
auxiliary cliord variable of grassmannodd parity to convert the single second class fermionic
constraint into the one of a rst class. further we present two methods for quantizing the model
with the single cliord variable, both producing the same spectrum of rstquantized physical
states.

the paper is organized as follows.
in section 2 we consider the one-parameter family of actions describing the generalized
d = 4 superparticle models labelled by the real positive parameter a  0 where the case
a = 0 corresponds to the ferbershirafuji model, while at a = 1 the action describes the
superparticle model of [1]. we demonstrate that in the target space with four supersymmetries
the a 6= 1 models possess two fermionic -symmetries and, hence, corresponding superparticle
congurations preserve 1/2 of the supersymmetries, while the a = 1 generalized superparticle
has three symmetries and, hence, preserves 3
4 of the supersymmetries. we also nd that the
u (1) symmetry is inherent to the a = 0 case only.

in section 3 we describe the transform to a supertwistor form of the action. we show that
0 < a < 1 models are described by a free osp(2|8) supertwistor action and thus link the ferber-
shirafuji su (2, 2|1) supertwistor model and the free osp(1|8) supertwistor model of [1]. the
model with a > 1 is transformed into a free osp(1, 1|8) supertwistor action. we perform the
quantization of the supertwistor models and nd that the supertwistor wave function describes
an innite tower of short supersymmetric multiplets of massless elds of all possible helicities.
in section 4 we extend the initial phase space of the superparticle model with auxiliary
variables and perform the conversion of the initial set of rst and second class constraints into
the rstclass constraints generating new gauge symmetries. we then carry out the quantization
of the extended model and nd that the dependence of the wave functions on grassmannodd
conversion variables is inessential and can be ignored. we show that the wave function of the
rstquantized model of section 2 can be identied with the supertwistor wave function of
section 3 if cartanpenrose twistor formulae relating superspace and supertwistor coordinates
are imposed. thus, we nd that the innite spectrum of the rstquantized states of the
superparticle consists of massless elds of an arbitrary (half)integer helicity.

in section 5 we consider a multidimensional generalization of the a = 1 model and its
quantization. it appears that after quantization the superwave function depends on only one
grassmann variable, and all other fermionic degrees of freedom can be eliminated by n  1
transformations, where n is the total number of supersymmetries. thus, the corresponding
superparticle conguration preserves the (n  1)/n fraction of targetspace supersymmetry.
real grassmann variable, which after quantization becomes a single cliord variable.

in the appendix we analyze in detail the quantization of a supersymmetric system with one

a is a numerical parameter which, without the loss of generality, can be taken to be real and
positive denite a = a  [0,). indeed, if a is complex its phase can always be absorbed by the
bosonic spinor a redened in an appropriate way (a  (a/|a|)1/2a).

the action (2.1) describes a superparticle propagating in the extended superspace

m (4+6|4) = {y m}  {(xa a, yab, y

a b; a, 

a)}

(2.4)

with tensorial central charge coordinates yab, y a b 1. the conguration space of the system

m(4+6+4|4) = {qm}  {(y m ; a, 

a)} = {(xa a, yab, y

a b; a, 

a; a, 

a)}

(2.5)

contains in addition four bosonic spinor coordinates a,  a.

the presence of the parameter a in the action (2.1) reects the property that each of its three
terms is separately invariant under global supersymmetry transformations acting on m (4+6|4)
as follows

a = a,

(2.9)

if a = 0 the action (2.1) reduces to the ferbershirafuji action [9, 10], and if a = 1 the action
becomes the one considered in [1]. we shall see that a = 0 and a = 1 are critical values of the
parameter where symmetries of the action (2.1) as well as the physical content of the model are
modied.

2.1 critical points a = 0 and a = 1

in order to analyze symmetry properties of the action (2.1) at dierent values of a we consider
the general variation of (2.1) which (modulo boundary terms) has the form

s = z ha(cid:16) ba b + 2abab(cid:17) +  a(cid:16)b ab + 2a b
z hd(cid:16)a b(cid:17)ia b + a d(cid:16)ab(cid:17)iab + a d(cid:16) a

(2.10)

(2.11)

2.1.1 u (1) gauge symmetry of a = 0 model
let us consider the variation of the action when the variations of all elds except for a,  a are
zero

s = z ha(cid:16) ba b + 2abab(cid:17) +  a(cid:16)b ab + 2a b

a b(cid:17)i .

(2.12)

(2.13)

if the variation of  corresponds to local innitesimal u (1) rotations


a( ) = aei( ),


a =  aei( )

the eq. (2.12) takes the form

s = z hi( )a(cid:16) ba b + 2abab(cid:17)  i( ) a(cid:16)b ab + 2a b

a b(cid:17)i .

such a variation vanishes at a = 0. hence at this value of a the u (1) transformations (2.13)
describe local symmetry of the model which is inherent to the ferber-shirafuji formulation [9, 10]
of the massless superparticle.

note that for all values of the parameter a the spinors  are constants on the mass shell.

indeed, the equations of motion

s
xa b

= 0,

s
yab = 0,

s
 y a b

= 0

4

which follow from (2.10) have the form

d(a  b) = 0,

a d(ab) = 0,

a d( a

 b) = 0.

(2.14)

in the framework of any twistor or twistor-like approach [33] one assumes that the bosonic spinors
parametrize a projective space. this requirement does not allow  to have all its components
equal to zero simultaneously.

then in the generic case a 6= 0 eqs. (2.14) imply

d(a) = 0,

d( a) = 0,

i.e. the bosonic spinor is constant on the mass shell

a( ) = 0

a = const,

 a = 0

a = const.

when a = 0 only one equation is left in (2.14)

a = 0 :

d(a  b) = 0.

the general solution of (2.17) is

a( ) = 0

aei ( ),

 a = 0

aei ( ).

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

the arbitrary function ( ) (whose presence in (2.18) reects the u (1) gauge symmetry of the
a = 1 model) can be gauged away by the local u (1) transformation (2.13), and we are again left
with constant  on the mass shell.

2.1.2 fermionic variations and symmetry

let us consider now the formula (2.10) with the variations of fermionic coordinates accompanied
by the following variations of x and y

xa b = i(cid:16)a  b  a  b(cid:17)  ia b = 0,

yab = i (a b)
 y a b = i ( a d  b)




iab = 0,
a b = 0.
i 

the bosonic spinor  remains unchanged. in such a case eq. (2.10) takes the form

s = z h2idaa(cid:16) 

b  b + abb(cid:17) + 2id 

b  b(cid:16)bb + a 

b  b(cid:17)i .

(2.19)

(2.20)

we see that for a 6= 1 only two out of four variations of the fermionic coordinates a,   a
are eectively involved into the variation (2.20) of the action (2.1). this reects the presence of
local fermionic  symmetry [25] with two independent parameters  = (1 +i2),  = (1i2).
the transformations of the coordinates are given by eq. (2.19) and

a = a = (1 + i2)a,

 

b = 

b = (1  i2)

b.

(2.21)

at the critical point a = 1 the number of independent symmetries increases from two to
three, since in this case only one linear combination (bb +   b  b) of four real fermionic
variations enters into the variation of the action

a = 1 :

s = z 2i(cid:16)daa + d 

a a(cid:17) (cid:16)bb + d 

b  b(cid:17).

(2.22)

5

thus remaining three fermionic variations correspond to the local fermionic symmetries of the
a = 1 model [1].

in order to present an explicit form of these three  symmetries we should introduce an

additional bosonic spinor ua such that

aua = 

a u a = 1.

then one can perform the decomposition of the unit matrix in the spinor space 2

 a
b = aub  uab,

a
b = 


a u b  u

a b

(2.23)

(2.24)

and use it to decompose the fermionic variation of .

as a result we nd that the symmetry transformations of the a = 1 model are given by

eqs. (2.19) and

a = (1 + i2)a + i3ua,

 

b = (1  i2)

a.
b  i3 u

(2.25)

2.2 hamiltonian analysis

we now turn to the hamiltonian analysis of the model with the purpose of getting all the
constraints on the dynamics of the system, classifying them a la dirac and thus identifying all
local symmetries of the model.

for the case a = 1 the analysis has been performed in [1]. the generic model (a 6= 0) has
the same total number of constraints as the a = 1 model, the only dierence being that when
the parameter a takes the value a = 1 one of the fermionic secondclass constraints becomes the
rstclass constraint generating the third symmetry. so what we should do is just to adapt
the results of the hamiltonian analysis of [1] to the generic case.

the constraints corresponding to the case a = 0 of the ferbershirafuji superparticle are
obtained from the generic set of constraints by putting the canonical momenta for the central
charge coordinates identically equal to zero.

the canonical momenta of the generic system are

(2.42)

(2.43)

(2.44)

(2.45)

(2.46)

to separate the constraints (2.28)(2.33) into the rst and second class let us project them

on the bosonic spinors  and u (eqs. (2.23), (2.24)). we get

f1 = ada = 0,

f2  (f1) = 
f3 = uada + u
f4  uada  u

a d a = 0,
a d a = 0,
a d a = 0.

(2.47)
for arbitrary a 6= 0, 1 it can be checked that the bosonic constraints (2.34)(2.39) and the
fermionic constraints (2.44) and (2.45) belong to the rst class, i.e. their poisson brackets with
all constraints vanish on the constraint surface, and the constraints (2.40)(2.43), (2.46) and
(2.47) are secondclass. when computing the poisson brackets of the constraints one should
take into account that, because of the normalization condition (2.23), the spinor ua should be
regarded as a variable depending on a. the simplest way of taking this into account is to
assume the following poisson (actually dirac) brackets of ua with the momentum pa

3

[pa, ub]p = ubua.

thus in the case a 6= 0, 1 among 14 bosonic and 4 fermionic constraints 6 bosonic and 2
fermionic constraints are of the rst class and 8 bosonic and 2 fermionic constraints are of the
second class.

3these brackets appear as dirac brackets with respect to the pair of the second class constraints (2.23) and
a = 0, (and their complex conjugate pair), when the bosonic spinor u is considered as an independent
a = 0. then it is not hard to verify that the new phase
a do not introduce new redundant degrees of freedom into the system under consideration.

the rst class constraints generate local symmetries of the dynamical system. for instance,
the constraints (2.34), and (b5 + b6) of (2.38), (2.39) generate worldline reparametrizations of
the coordinates x and y. the fermionic constraints (2.44) and (2.45) generate the symmetry
transformations (2.19) and (2.21).

each rst class constraint reduces the number of independent phase space variables by two,
while each second class constraint eliminates only one degree of freedom. hence, in the case
a 6= 0, 1 the phase space of 2  (4 + 6 + 4) = 28 bosonic and 2  4 = 8 fermionic canonical
variables of the system is reduced to

a 6= 0, 1 :

nph = 8b + 2f

(2.48)

i.e. we get eight bosonic and two fermionic physical degrees of freedom.

in order to see how at a = 1 the fermionic secondclass constraint (2.46) transforms into the
rstclass constraint generating the third symmetry (2.25) let us consider the poisson bracket
of the constraint (2.46) with itself

{f3, f3}p = 2(a  1).

(2.49)

when a 6= 1 the r.h.s. of (2.49) is nonzero and hence this constraint is second class, but at
a = 1 the r.h.s. of (2.49) vanishes. since f3 weakly commutes with all other constraints, at
this critical value of a we obtain one more fermionic rst class constraint, and we achieve the
reduction of the number of independent fermionic physical degrees of freedom from two to one

a = 1 :

nph = 8b + 1f .

(2.50)

finally, when a = 0 the tensorial coordinates y disappear from the action (2.1), and in
eqs. (2.34)(2.47) we must put to zero their canonical momenta z. the remaining set of the
constraints takes the following form

b1 = a

b2 = a u

bpa b = 0,

these are the constraints of the ferbershirafuji formulation of the superparticle which has been
analyzed in detail in a number of papers [10, 20, 21, 22, 23]. now two bosonic constraints (2.51)
and (2.55) are rstclass and other six are secondclass, while, as in the generic case a 6= 1, two
of the fermionic constraints are rstclass (2.57), (2.58) and two are secondclass (2.59), (2.60).

therefore, the number of independent phasespace physical degrees of freedom of the stan-

dard n = 1, d = 4 superparticle consists of six bosonic and two fermionic variables

a = 0 :

nph = 6b + 2f .

(2.61)

in the next section we shall show that the independent phasespace physical degrees of
freedom (2.48), (2.50) and (2.61) of the generic superparticle model can be covariantly described
by osp(2|8) (or osp(1, 1|8)), osp(1|8) and su (2, 2|1) supertwistors, respectively.

thus, in the generic case a 6= 0, 1 one can reformulate the dynamical system in terms of 8
bosonic variables a, a;  b,  b and two real fermionic variables 1, 2. these variables can
be regarded as components of a real (8, 2) component supertwistor (cf. with [1])

(3.11)

we see that the symmetry group of the fermionic sector of the metric (3.9) is so(2) = u (1)
when a < 1 and so(1, 1) when a > 1.

hence, when a < 1 the complete symmetry group of the metric (3.9) is the supergroup
osp(2|8), while in the case a > 1 the symmetry group becomes osp(1, 1|8). the supertwistors
(3.7) transform under the fundamental representations of these supergroups.

when a = 1 the metric becomes degenerate

(2)  (2)

a=1 = 2(cid:18) 1 0
0 0(cid:19) .

(3.12)

this reects the absence of the second fermionic variable 2 from the action (3.2). thus at
a = 1 the supergroups osp(2|8) and osp(1, 1|8) reduce to osp(1|8) with the corresponding
supertwistor representation having one real fermionic component (cf. with [1])

ya = (y1, . . . , y8; 1).

(3.13)

consider now the case a = 0. at a = 0 the action has the same form as for a < 1 and hence
is formally osp(2|8) invariant. but, as we have seen in the previous section, at this critical
point the model acquires additional local u (1) symmetry, which must have its counterpart in
the supertwistor description, i.e. there should appear a rstclass constraint on the supertwistor
variables which generates this symmetry. in order to identify this constraint we use the dening
relations (3.3) and consider the following bilinear combination of supertwistor components for
an arbitrary value of a

a(a)a  

a(a) a + 2i  = 2ay  2ay.

(3.14)

at a = 0 eq. (3.14) does not involve central charge coordinates y and thus we obtain the pure
supertwistor constraint

a(0)a  

a(0) a + 2i  = 0.

(3.15)

hence, at a = 0 for the action (3.1) to be equivalent to (2.1) it must be supplemented with the
(rstclass) constraint (3.15) introduced through a lagrange multiplier term

a = 0 :

s = z (cid:16)ada + 

ad a(cid:17)  iz (d  + d) + iz d (   + 2i ) (3.16)

10

the constraint (3.15) generates the u (1) gauge symmetry appearing only in the a = 0 case.
this constraint introduces the complex structure and thus breaks the osp(2|8) symmetry of the
a < 1 model down to su (2, 2|1). as a result one gets the ferber-shirafuji formulation [9, 10] of
a conventional massless superparticle [41, 42, 43] in terms of su (2, 2|1) supertwistors

za = (a, 

a, ),

z a = (a,  a, ),

a = 0 :

s = z (cid:16) z adza(cid:17) + iz d ( z aza  s),

(3.17)

where the constant s has been introduced in order to have the possibility of describing massless
superparticles with nonzero (super)helicity [33] (see [22, 35] and references therein for details).

3.1 quantization of the supertwistor model

3.1.1 canonical supertwistor quantization

the quantization of the dynamical system (3.2) with a 6= 0, 1 is quite straightforward. the
action is of the rst order form, therefore ,  should be identied with the canonical momenta
conjugate to a,  a, and 2i (a) is the momentum conjugate to (a) (remember that (a) and
(a) are dened by (3.6)). the canonical poisson brackets are

[a, b]p =  b
a ,

[ a, 

b]p = 

b
a ,

{ (a), (a)}p = 

i
2

.

(3.18)

at the quantum level the dynamical variables become operators, and the poisson brackets are
replaced by (anti)commutators ([..., ...]p  i[..., ...], {,}p  i{,}).). for instance, in the
coordinate representation the momenta are the derivatives of corresponding coordinates

a = i



a

,

a = i




 a

,

(a) = 

1
2



(a)

.

(3.19)

the canonical hamiltonian of the system vanishes identically.
the wave function of the system in the supertwistor coordinate representation is

a 6= 1 : (a,  a, (a)) = (a,  a) + i(a)(a,  a)

(3.20)

and the spectrum of quantum states is described by one bosonic and one fermionic function
depending on weyl spinor variables.

at a = 1 (1) becomes a real cliord variable and the eld (3.20) becomes a cliord algebra

valued function. we shall discuss this case in detail in subsections 3.1.4, 5.2. and appendix.

to understand what kind of physical states are described by the function (3.20) in the case

a 6= 0, 1 we shall rst consider the well known case a = 0.

3.1.2

a = 0

at a = 0 the dynamics of the system is subject to the rstclass constraint (3.15) which at the
quantum level is imposed on the wave function (3.20) 4

(d(0) + 


  s)(a,  a; ) = 0,

(3.21)

4in this section we basically follow the quantization procedure of references [21]. the operator d = d(0) +  


is the superhelicity operator.

11

where

d(0) = a



a   a


 a

is the supertwistor representation of the bosonic part of the u (1) generator,  = (0) (see eqs.
(3.4)(3.6)) and s is an integer constant which appears due to the ambiguity in ordering the
operators in (3.21) (see [33, 22, 35] and refs. therein for details, here we only note that the
quantization of s follows from the requirement for the wave function to be single valued). the
(half)integer values of s/2 describe helicities of massless quantum states.

let us consider rst the case s = 0. eq. (3.21) requires the bosonic and fermionic components
of the supereld (3.20) to be homogeneous functions of ,  of the degree 0 and 1, respectively,
(3.22)

d(0)(a,  a) = 0,

d(0)(a,  a) = (a,  a)

the solution is 5

where, by denition, pm is a light-like vector composed of  and  (see also (2.28))

 = 0(pm),

 = 

a  a(pm)

pa a = pmm

a a = a a.

(3.23)

(3.24)

we see that the spectrum of the ferbershirafuji model at s = 0 consists of a massless
n = 1, d = 4 (anti)chiral supermultiplet containing a complex scalar eld of zero helicity and
a weyl fermion eld of helicity  1
2 . this supermultiplet can be described either by the set of
bosonic and fermionic wave functions depending on the bosonic weyl spinor variables a,  a in
accordance with the formula (3.23)-(3.24), or as a set of the unrestricted bosonic scalar function
0(pm) and the fermionic spinor function  a(pm) depending on the light-like vector pmpm = 0
which we identify with the momentum of the massless superparticle. in such a way we establish
the relation of the supertwistor formulation with the spacetime description of the massless
superparticle, and this dual description can be extended to the case of more general model with
nonvanishing central charge coordinates.

finally, let us consider the case of the nonvanishing operator ordering constant s in (3.21)
which we shall call the superhelicity parameter, characterizing the helicity properties of the
supereld solutions.

the component form of the constraint (3.21) now reads

d(0)(a,  a) = s(a,  a),

d(0)(a,  a) = (s  1)(a,  a)

(3.25)

for integer s > 0 the solution of (3.25) is

 = a1 . . . asa1...as(pm),

 = a1 . . . as1a1...as1(pm)

(3.26)

5 a rigorous approach [35, 36] consists in the consideration of the decomposition of the wave function
(a,  a) in the basis of the functions on c2  {0} formed by homogeneous innite-dierentiable functions
1,2 (za, z a) = z1 z2 1,2 (a,  a) of a homogeneity index  = (1, 2) [37]. the homogeneous functions
are dened by the mellin transformation

the decomposition

1,2 (a,  a) =

i

2z dzdz z1+1 z2+1(za, z a).

(a,  a) = 

+



+

z

d(n+i)/2,(n+i)/2(a,  a)

can be substituted into eq. (3.22) instead of the power series in a,  a to obtain the general solution. we refer
the reader to [35, 36] for further details and to [37] for an excellent presentation of related mathematics, and, for
simplicity, use a physical shortcut of the rigorous approach.

12

we thus obtain supermultiplets whose components have the helicities s/2 and s/2 1/2, respec-
tively. the choice of the statistics of the superelds (3.26) should be made in accordance with
the general spinstatistics theorem, such that for the even values of s (integer superhelicities)
the superelds (3.26) are bosonic and for odd s (half-integer superhelicities) they are fermionic.
notice that the grassmann parity of the supereld  (3.21) (and its components  and )
is related to the parity of (, , ) under the change     (parity) which implies
if (,,) = (, , ) then from (3.26) follows that s is even (integer
   .
superhelicities) and such a supereld is grassmanneven ( is bosonic and  is fermionic).
analogously if the supereld (, , ) changes the sign under the parity, then s is odd (half-
integer superhelicities) and the supereld is grassmannodd ( is fermionic, and  is bosonic).

for integer s < 0 the solution of (3.25) is

 = 

a1 . . . 

as  a1... as

 = 

a1 . . . 

as+1  a1... as+1

(3.27)

and thus the spectrum of the quantum states of the model is represented by a supermultiplet of
helicity (s/2, (s + 1)/2).

3.1.3

a 6= 0, 1

let us return to the generic a 6= 0, 1 models. their spectrum is dened by arbitrary scalar
bosonic and fermionic functions of the weyl bosonic spinors (a,  a) and (a,  a) which, in
contrast to the a = 0 case, are not subject to any constraints. the bosonic spinor components
can be regarded to be dened through the components of the light-like vector pmpm = 0 (3.24)
up to the phase transformations

a  ei( )a,

 a  ei( ) a.

(3.28)

thus for a 6= 0 we can consider the bosonic and fermionic wave functions to depend on the
light-like vector and a u (1) angle variable    + 2k

(a,  a) = (pm, ),

(a,  a) = (pm, ).

(3.29)

hence, in contrast to the ferbershirafuji model, the wave function of the generic dynamical
system (3.1) with a 6= 0 depends on one additional variable which parametrizes a compact
manifold u (1) = s1. this means that the functions  and , as the single valued functions, can
be expanded in the fourier series

(pm, ) = kzeikk(pm),

(pm, ) = kzeikk(pm).

(3.30)

the meaning of this series expansion becomes clear if we use the lorentzcovariant repre-
sentation of  and  as single valued functions of a (3.20) where a a are replaced by pm.
then the series (3.30) acquires the form

(, ) = 0(pm) + kz+(cid:16)a1 . . . aka1...ak(pm) + 
(, ) = 0(pm) + kz+(cid:16)a1 . . . ak a1...ak(pm) + 

a1 . . . 

ak  a1... ak

(3.31)

a1 . . . 

ak  a1... ak

(pm)(cid:17) ,

(pm)(cid:17) .

we therefore conclude that the most general solution of the model with a 6= 0 describes an
innite doubly degenerate spectrum of massless elds of an arbitrary helicity, with the additional
compact s1coordinate in the momentum space conjugate to the discrete helicity variable.

if we assume the validity of spinstatistics theorem the bosonic elds should have positive
parity, and fermionic elds should have odd parity. thus, the -even part +(, , ) 

13

+(,,) = +(, )+i(, ) of the general supereld solution (, , ) = (, )+
i(, ) (see (3.20) and (3.31)) should be regarded as bosonic (i.e. grassmanneven). conse-
quently this implies that the wave function +(, ) has positive parity (even powers of )
i.e. it is bosonic, and the fermionic wave function (, ) has negative parity (odd powers
of ). another sector of the full quantum state spectrum is described by the fermionic odd
supereld (, , )  (,,) = (, ) + +(, ) which is composed of the
fermionic -odd eld (, ) and the bosonic even eld +(, ).
we, therefore, see that in order to obtain physically meaningful solutions described by the
superelds +(, , ) and (, , ) with denite grassmann parity one should divide the
general solution (3.20) into two parts with even and odd parity. note that the supereld
solutions with denite even/odd parity have the even/odd superhelicities, but each of them
contains a complete nondegenerate spectrum of states with both even and odd helicities.

it is instructive to compare the consequences of the presence of the internal compact
coordinate in our case and in kaluzaklein theories. in the kaluzaklein theories the compact
variables arise in an extension of spacetime with extra directions and lead to the quantization of
corresponding internal momenta in the extended momentum space. the internal quantized
momenta describe masses and gauge charges of kaluzaklein elds in the dimensionally reduced
theory 6. in our case the compactication is achieved by expressing the generalized momenta
in terms of bosonic spinor (twistor) componenta. thus, we have the opposite situation: the
compact internal manifold is in the extended momentum (twistor) space and a quantized
(discrete) central charge coordinate is in the extended coordinate space (spacetime + central
charge coordinates). the fourier transform of the compact internal momentum results in
the discrete values of the conjugate coordinate, which are described by an integer s. from
the physical point of view the (half)integer number s/2 describes the possible helicities of the
massless quantum states.

the quantum states of our model form a reducible (innitedimensional) representation of
target space supersymmetry. indeed, as the bosonic spinor is inert under global supersymmetry,
the elds (3.31) can be collected into the supereld series expansion with each term having
denite superhelicity

(a, 

a, (a)) = 0(pm, (a)) + kz+

a1 . . . aka1...ak(pm, (a))+

(3.32)

+kz+

a1 . . . 


ak  a1... ak

(pm, (a)).

it is easy to see that each term is separately invariant under supersymmetry 7.

in the case a = 0 the additional u (1) constraint (3.21) appears. it singles out one irreducible

supereld with a denite superhelicity out of the innite series (3.32).

3.1.4

a = 1

consider now a peculiarity of the model at a = 1. in this case the action (3.1), (3.2) contains
only one real fermionic variable 1. the corresponding term in the action is

s = 4iz 1d1

1 =

1
2

( + ).

from (3.33) we conclude that the odd momentum of  is proportional to  itself

(3.33)

(3.34)

6it is worth mentioning that usual lorentzscalar central charges can be interpreted as kaluza-klein momenta

s = 1  4i1 = 0.

[38]

7remember that the supersymmetry transformations of the supereld (3.32) are generated by the transforma-

tions of  as functions of  (eqs. (3.4)).

14

eq. (3.34) is the secondclass constraint being typical of any free fermion theory

{s, s}p = 8i.

(3.35)

it can be regarded to be satised in the strong sense [30] after we pass from the poisson brackets
to the dirac brackets

which imply

[f, g}d = [f, g}p 

i
8

[f, s}p [s, g}p

hence, upon quantization  becomes a cliord variable of odd grassmann parity

{1, 1}d = 2i.

( 1)2 = 1.

(3.36)

(3.37)

(3.38)

(3.39)

the cliord algebra generated by this variable consists of two elements, the unit element
and 1. hence, all functions of 1 can be written as a cliord algebra valued supereld having
two components [27]

() =  + i 1,

where  and  do not depend on 1.

we conclude that at a = 1 the wave functions (3.20), (3.32) become cliord superelds
whose components again (as in the case a 6= 0, 1) describe an innite tower of elds of all possible
helicities.
we can decompose the superelds (3.39) into the even and odd parts with respect to -
parity and thus have the wave functions with denite grassmann parity (bosonic and fermionic
superelds).

we see that at a = 1 the model has the same spectrum of quantum physical states as in
the generic case. the dierence with the generic case (a 6= 1) is only in the transformation
properties of the eld components with respect to target space supersymmetry  the a = 1
supersymmetry multiplets are shortened (see [1], section 2). note also that in the models with
a  1 one can impose additional reality condition on the quantum wave functions.
in the appendix we shall present another way of quantizing a single classical fermionic
variable 1 (see (3.33)) which allows to treat it as a usual grassmann variable and quantum
superwave functions as standard superelds.

4 quantization by using the conversion method

in order to justify the results of the supertwistor quantization of the model presented in sect. 3
and to clarify the spacetime structure of the quantum wave functions, in this section we shall
perform the quantization directly in the coordinate representation.

because of the appearance of a particular mixture of fermionic rst and second class con-
straints there appears a problem of quantizing the system covariantly. however, there exists a
powerful method to handle this problem [19, 17, 18], which is based on the conversion of the
second class constraints into the rst class ones.

the quantization of the ferber-shirafuji model by the conversion method was considered in
[20, 21, 22, 23]. in [22] a d = 10 supersymmetric particle with extra tensorial coordinates has
been also discussed. in the present paper, however, the relation between spinor variables and
the tensorial central charges, as well as their physical interpretation, goes far beyond the results
presented in [22].

15

4.1 conversion degrees of freedom

to convert the second class constraints into the rst class ones we introduce additional (conver-
sion) phase space degrees of freedom, whose number is equal to the the number of the second
class constraints.

thus, for the a 6= 0, 1 models we need 8b + 2f conversion degrees of freedom. for this

purpose we introduce bosonic spinors a,  a plus its canonical momenta p a

(), p a
()

[p a

(), b]p =  a
b ,

[ p

a
 ,  b]p = 

a
b ,

and two real fermionic variables f1 and f2 whose poisson brackets form a cliord algebra

{f1, f1}p = i(1  a),

{f1, f2}p = 0,

{f2, f2}p = i(1 + a).

instead of f1 and f2 we shall also use two conjugate fermionic variables

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

s = q(1 + a)f1  iq(1  a)f2,

s = q(1 + a)f1 + iq(1  a)f2,
{s, s}p = 2i(1  a2).

(4.4)
note, that s is complex conjugate of s only for the case 0 < a < 1, while for a > 1, where

{s, s}p = 0,

{ s, s}p = 0,

p(1  a) = ip|1  a| is imaginary, both s and s are independent real variables.

for a 6= 1 s can be regarded as the momentum conjugate to s.

4.2 conversion of the constraints

we use the additional degrees of freedom (4.1) and (4.2) in order to convert the mixture of rst
and second class constraints (2.28)(2.33) into the rst class ones.

as it was shown in [26], in twistor-like formulations of particle mechanics it is convenient to
perform conversion of the whole set of primary constraints, without dividing them into the sets
of rst and second class constraints.

for any a the rst class constraints obtained as the result of conversion are 8

a b  pa b  (a + a)( b +  b) = 0,

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

the algebra of the rst class constraints (4.5)(4.11) is quite simple. the only nonvanishing

brackets (in the strong sense) appear in the fermionic sector and have the form

d  (cid:18){da, db}p
{ d a, db}p

{da, d b}p
{ d a, d b}p (cid:19) = 2i(cid:18) ab

8we denote the converted constraints with the same letters as the original ones.

(4.12)

16

the r.h.s. of (4.12) vanishes weakly, i.e. on the constraint surface (4.5)(4.7).

note that the expressions (4.5)(4.7), (4.10) and (4.11) contain only the combination ( + )

of the commuting spinors. we denote this combination by 

a = a + a,

 a =  a +  a,

while the linearly independent variables

a = a  a,

 a =  a   a

(4.13)

(4.14)

completely decouple and have vanishing canonical momenta (4.9). hence, the variables (4.14)
can be excluded from the consideration, since the wave functions will not depend on these
variables.

4.3 quantization of the converted system: equations for the wave function

now it is straightforward to quantize the system by using the dirac method [30]. for this
purpose let us choose the (super-)shrodinger representation for the superspace coordinates and
the bosonic spinor variables

the grassmann parity of f1 and f2 must be odd because the constraints (4.10) and (4.11) should
have denite parity.

note that the linear combinations (4.3) of fermionic quantum variables f1 and f2 satisfy the

commutation relations

{ s, s} = 0,

s,
{

s} = 0,

{ s,

s} = 2(1  a2).

(4.18)

so one can choose s as an odd coordinate and

s as its momentum operator

s = 2(1  a2)


s

,

s = s

despite of the fact that such a representation makes hermiticity condition nonmanifest, it is
convenient since it simplies the calculations and provides the possibility of treating the cases
0 < a < 1 and a > 1 on an equal footing.

after quantization the rstclass constraints (4.5)-(4.8), (4.10) and (4.11) are imposed on

the wave function

4.4 quantization of the converted system: dependence on the fermionic vari-

ables

to nd the solution of equations (4.29) and (4.30) we take their linear combinations and rewrite
them in the following form

(cid:20)p1  a2(



 (a)  (a))  s(cid:21) g = 0,

(cid:20)p1  a2(



(a)  (a))  2(1  a2)



s(cid:21) g = 0,

where (a) were introduced in (3.5), (3.6) and s are dened in (4.3).

(4.31)

(4.32)

the equations (4.31) and (4.32) are easily solved in terms of the components of the super-

function g(s)

g(s) = g0(, ) + isg1(, )

(4.33)

18

which satises the conditions

(


 (a)  (a))g0 = 0  g0(, ) = e (a)(a)(a,  a; (a)),

(4.34)

(4.35)

2p1  a2g1(, ) = i(



(a)  (a))g0.

we see that when a 6= 1 the component g1 of the superfunction (4.33) is expressed in terms
of g0 which is specied by the condition (4.34) in terms of a single independent supereld
(a,  a; (a)).

hence, the independent wave function (4.19) which describes the general solution of the

equations (4.20)(4.24) is

 = eia  axa a+iaab yab +ia a

 b y a b (a)(a) (a, 

a

; (a)).

(4.36)

at the critical value a = 1 the result is the same though the proof is slightly changed since in
such a case (as in subsection 3.1.4) we should deal with a single conversion cliord variable f
instead of f1 and f2 (and/or s and s). more precisely, in eqs. (4.29) and (4.30) one should
put a=1,  =  and f1 = s = 0, and then follow the quantization prescription described in the
appendix.

a

one should notice that the wave function (a, 

; (a)) in (4.36) has exactly the same
structure as in the supertwistor case (3.20), but where now (a) are the composite grassmann
coordinates dened by eqs. (3.5), (3.6). we therefore conclude that the direct supertwistor
quantization and the quantization with the use of conversion of the superparticle model based
on the generic action (2.1) result in the same supersymmetric spectrum of the quantum states.

a
the supersymmetry transformations of the components of (a, 

; (a)) are easily derived

from (4.36) using the supersymmetric variations (2.6) of the coordinates.

the higher dimensional generalization of the a = 1 model and its quantization will be the

subject of the next section.

5 the a = 1 model in higher dimensions and internal degrees of

freedom

a generalization of the d = 4, a = 1 superparticle model has been proposed in [1]. in higher
spacetime dimensions d we consider an extension of an n = 1 supersymmetry algebra by
tensorial central charges

{q, q} = p,

[p , q] = 0,

(5.1)

where, depending on spacetime dimension d, the supercharges q ( = 1, . . . 2k) are real ma-
jorana, or majoranaweyl spinors9 and p is a symmetric generalized momentum generator
conjugate to 2k(2k +1) symmetric spin-tensor coordinates x , which can be split into the usual
spacetime coordinates and tensorial central charge coordinates, as we shall demonstrate below.

we assume that p is dened by the cartanpenrose relation

p = ,

(5.2)

where the real bosonic spinor  has the same spinor properties as the supercharge q.

9 in the general case one can also consider the cases of pseudomajorana, simplecticmajorana and dirac
(complex) supercharges [39]. technical details of the extension of the results of section 5 to arbitrary type of
supercharges will be considered in another publication.

19

the expression (5.2) implies the bps condition detp = 0 and can be obtained as a primary

constraint from the action functional [1]

s = zm1



 = dx   id() = d 
 ,

 = 1, ..., 2k.

(5.3)

for any value of k the model possesses 2k global target space supersymmetries generated by

(5.1)

susyx  = i(),

susy = ,

susy = 0,

as well as 2k  1 symmetries.

to show the presence of the 2k  1 symmetries let us write the variation of the action (5.3)
s = zm1(cid:16)2  + d()i  2id(cid:17) +(cid:16)i(cid:17)|
(5.4)

f
i ,

where

one can see that only one linear combination  of 2k independent variations of grass-

mann coordinates  is eectively involved into the variation of the action.

i = x   i().

hence, other 2k  1 grassmann coordinate variations (which do not appear in (5.4)) can be
identied with the parameters of local fermionic symmetry. they can be written in the form

i = ui

,

where ui

 (i = 1, . . . , 2k  1) and  form a set of 2k linearly independent bosonic spinors.

identifying the  symmetry with the part of target space supersymmetry which is preserved
by the particle or brane conguration, we claim that the model (5.3) describes the dynamics of
bps states preserving all but one target space supersymmetries in spacetime of a dimension
d.

examples.

in d = 3 (where k = 1) the action (5.3) describes the standard massless superparticle

k = 1  d = 3 : x  = x m

m , p  = p m
m .

on the other hand the case k = 1 can be regarded as a model in a minimal d = 2+2 superspace
with self-dual tensorial central charge coordinates x  = ymn

mn, ymn = 1

2 mnklykl.

the case of k = 2 corresponds to the d = 4, a = 1 model considered in sections 24 but

written in the majorana representation.

the construction also holds in d = 6 where k = 3, but here we should use the (su (2)
majoranaweyl) reality conditions. in addition to the 4dimensional spinor index  the com-
plex 8component spinors qi
 carry the su (2) index i = 1, 2 and they are the su (2)
majoranaweyl spinors (see for details [39]). the number of tensorial central charges in this
model is 30.

the case k = 4 can be regarded as describing a d = 10 massless superparticle with 126 com-
posite (selfdual) tensorial central charges zm1...m5 [1] (cf. with [2, 22]). the real supercharges
q satisfy the majoranaweyl reality condition.

the action (5.3) with k = 5 corresponds to a 0superbrane model in d = 11 superspace
with 517 tensorial central charges composed from 32 components of one real bosonic majorana
spinor. in contrast to the cases of d = 3, 4, 6 and 10, in such a model the superparticle is not
massless, the mass of the 0-brane being generated dynamically in a way similar to the mechanism
generating the tension of superstrings and superbranes [44] (see [1] for some details).

on the other hand it is possible to use the twelve dimensional d = 2 + 10 32  32 gamma
matrices to treat the k = 5 model from the point of view of twotime physics [4]. the bosonic co-
ordinates x  are decomposed into twoindex and selfdual 6index central charge coordinates
ymn, ym1...m6 = 1/6!m1...m6n1...n6yn1...n6.

5.1 osp(1|2k) supertwistor representation of the d-dimensional model
performing the integration by parts we can rewrite the action (5.3) in the osp(1|2k) invariant
form (i.e. osp(1|16) for d = 10 and osp(1|32) for d = 11) in terms of a supertwistor y a =
(, )

s = z (d + id ),

 = 1, . . . , 2k.

(5.5)

the generalized penroseferber correspondence between the supertwistors and the generalized
superspace looks as follows

p = ,  = x   i(),

 = .

(5.6)

and does not imply other constraints.

5.2 quantization of the higher dimensional model with the use of conversion

the quantization of the supertwistor formulation (5.3) is straightforward and is completely
analogous to the quantization of the d = 4 model considered in subsection 3.1.4 and appendix.

the spectrum of quantum states is described by the supereld

 = (, ) = () + i()

(5.7)

depending on the bosonic spinor  and one grassmann (or, equivalently, cliord) variable .

for completeness we briey describe the quantization of the higher dimensional model (5.3)

with the use of conversion.

the primary constraints of the model (5.3) are

  p   = 0
d   + ip = 0

p 

() = 0

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

where the momenta are dened in such a way that the nonvanishing poisson brackets have the
following form

[p, x ]p = 2(

()
),

{, }p = 
,

[p 

(), ]p = 
 .

(5.11)

21

this set of 2k(2k + 1)/2 bosonic and 2k fermionic constraints obeys the algebra

[, p 

()]p = 2(
),

{d, d}p = 2ip  2i( + ),

(5.12)

all other brackets = 0,

and thus contains 2k bosonic and 1 fermionic second class constraints. therefore, our system
with 2k(2k + 1)/2 bosonic and 2k fermionic conguration space variables contain 2k bosonic
and 1 fermionic physical degrees of freedom which can be identied with the components of
osp(1|2k) supertwistor.

exactly as in the d = 4 case, to perform the conversion (see [15][18]) of the second class
constraints into the rst class ones we introduce additional conversion degrees of freedom (two
for each pair of the bosonic second class constraints and one selfconjugate fermionic variable
for each fermionic second class constraint)

[p 

(), ]p = 
,

{, } = 

i
2

,

(5.13)

and transform the secondclass constraints into rstclass ones extending the former with the
new coordinates and momenta

  p   = 0,

d  d + 2   + ip + 2 = 0,

p 

 = 0.

(5.14)

(5.17)

(5.18)

where

following the appendix we obtain the superwave function describing the rstquantized
states of the model determined by the single supereld (5.7) depending on  and one grassmann
variable  = (). we have

(a, ()) = e

i
2

  x h(a) + i() (a)i .

in the sector with even parity of the wave function ( = +) the spectrum of the quantum
states of the model (5.3) is described by one bosonic +(a) and one fermionic (a) function,
while in the odd sector ( = ) we have the fermionic eld (a) and the bosonic eld
+(a). this is in complete correspondence with the result of the quantization of the free
supertwistor model (5.5).

5.3 properties of the wave function with arbitrary helicity spectrum

(5.19)

and use the decomposition of the product of the spinor representations in the basis of d-
dimensional gamma-matrices.

for the simplest case k = 1 ( = 1, 2), where our model coincides with a d = 3 counterpart

of the usual (ferber-shirafuji) model [9, 10], the fierz identity reads 10

d = 3 :

10 we use the matrices a

coordinates and momenta

thus, in d = 3 eq. (5.19) describes a plane wave solution11

(5.20)

the case k = 2, d = 4 has been analized in detail in sections 24. to transform the wave
function (5.19) to the wave function (4.36) (at a = 1, and  = 0) one should perform the
similarity transformation from the real majorana to the complex weyl representation of the
d = 4 gammamatrices and replace the majorana spinor by the pair of complex conjugate weyl
spinors

  (cid:18) a
 a(cid:19) .

(5.21)

in the momentum representation the wave function () diers from the usual one given
by 0(pm) by the presence of additional dependence on the angle variable  which describes the
common phase factor of the weyl spinor a (1 = ei(+)|1|, 2 = ei()|2|) and parametrizes
the 1-dimensional sphere s1

tation of so(1, d  1) in d = 3, 4, 6, 10 (mod 8) (i.e. k = 3, 4, . . .) the discussion is similar. for
example, in the case k = 4, d = 10 we can use the basis of symmetric  matrices m, m1...m5

it was demonstrated that the d = 10 model contains the local symmetries (rst class con-
straints) and secondclass constraints which reduce the number of the classical bosonic degrees
of freedom to the ones described by the 16component bosonic spinor  and its momentum plus
11more precisely, in d = 3 (a) = (pm, sign()), where sign() denotes the sign factor (1) of the bosonic

one grassmann degree of freedom. in the quantum theory this is reected in the dependence of
the momentum space representation of the wave function on 16 bosonic spinor variables and
one grassmann variable only.

due to the identities (m)((m)) = 0 the d = 10 momentum (5.23) is lightlike. hence,
the tensorial central charge momenta zm1...m5 contain 16  9 = 7 additional degrees of freedom
which are not determined by the light-like momentum.

we now show that these additional internal degrees of freedom parametrize an s7 sphere.
for this purpose we perform a lorentz transformation to a frame where the lightlike momentum
(5.23) acquires the form

then in this frame we make an so(8) invariant split of the bosonic spinor

thus, the 16 components of the bosonic spinor  in d = 10 can be split into (double

i) degrees of freedom which characterize the light-like momentum pm,
ii) 7 coordinates of the sphere s7.

the variables parametrizing the sphere s7 correspond to helicity degrees of freedom of the

quantum states of the massless d = 10 superparticle.

it is worth mentioning that the appearance of extra compact dimensions in the momentum
spaces of the superparticle models considered above is related to the well known fact that in
d = 3, 4, 6 and 10 the commuting spinors (twistors) with n = 2(d  2) = 2, 4, 8 and 16 com-
ponents parametrize, modulo scale transformations, s1, s3, s7 and s15 spheres, respectively.
these spheres are hopf brations (ber bundles) which are associated with the division alge-
bras r, c, h and o. their bases are the spheres s1, s2, s4 and s8, and the bers are z 2,
s1 = u (1), s3 = su (2) and s7, respectively. the base spheres are parametrized (up to a
scaling factor which, due to the cartan-penrose representation, is identied with the square of
spinor components) by the lightlike vectors (massless particle momenta) in d = 3, 4, 6 and 10,
respectively. we see that the bers are extra momentum dimensions which we have in our
models with central charges (at a 6= 0). this is the geometrical ground for the appearance of s1
in d = 4 and s7 in d = 10.

6 conclusion and discussion

we have performed the detailed analysis and quantization of the massless superparticle model
with tensorial central charges associated with twistorlike commuting spinors in spacetimes of
dimension d = 3, 4, 6 and 10. the physical phase space degrees of freedom of this model have
a natural description in terms of supertwistors which form a fundamental representation of a
corresponding maximal supergroup of conformal type underlying the dynamics of the superpar-
ticle.

a peculiarity of the a = 1 model is that it possesses n = 2[ d

2 ]  1 symmetries, while
the standard massless superparticles have n = 2[ d
2 ]1 symmetries. the presence of such a
large number of symmetries in the a = 1 models means that the superparticle breaks only
one of the 2[ d
2 ] supersymmetries of the target space vacuum. this results in very short two
component supermultiplets describing the quantum states of the a = 1 superparticle, since the
corresponding target space superelds depend only on one grassmann coordinate. the existence
of these short lorentzcovariant superelds is made possible because the target superspace has
been enlarged by commuting spinor coordinates, whose role is in singling out a small covariant
subsuperspace in the extended target superspace. let us compare this situation with well known
cases.

in the case of the ordinary massless superparticle in n=1, d=4 superspace the quantum
states of the superparticle are described by a chiral scalar supereld [45]. the chirality constraint
is a consequence of rstclass fermionic constraints generating symmetries. consequently the
chiral supereld eectively depends on only two grassmann coordinates, which reects the fact
that the ordinary superparticle preserves half (i.e. two out of four) supersymmetries of n = 1,
d = 4 superspace.

in the case of an n = 2, d = 4 superparticle in harmonic superspace [46] which also
breaks half of the target space supersymmetries, su (2)harmonic variables allow one to pick
a harmonic analytic subsuperspace out of the general n = 2, d = 4 superspace [47], and
quantum states of the superparticle are described by analytic superelds which depend on four
grassmann coordinates singled out from the original eight grassmann coordinates by the use of
the harmonic variables.

25

in the analogous way, in the case of the generalized superparticle model (2.1), (5.3) at
a = 1, when only one target space supersymmetry is broken, one nds a lorentz covariant
subsuperspace of the target superspace, which has only one grassmann direction parametrized
by the lorentz scalar . the short superelds (4.36), (5.18), which exist only due to
the presence of the auxiliary spinor variable, describe the quantum states of the generalized
superparticle.

we have shown that in contrast to standard superparticles the considered model possesses
additional compact phasespace variables which describe helicity degrees of freedom of the su-
perparticle and which upon quantization parametrize innite tower of free states with arbitrary
(half)integer helicities. due to this property it would be interesting to consider the possibility of
treating our generalized superparticle model as a classical mechanics counterpart of the theory
of higherspin elds developed by m. vasiliev [13]. since the nontrivially interacting higher
spin elds should live in a spacetime of (anti)-desitter geometry a natural generalization of
the results of this paper would be to consider a superparticle model on supergroup manifolds
describing isometries of corresponding ads superspaces. for d = 4 the supergroup osp(1|4) is
the isometry of a d = 4 ads superspace osp(1|4)
so(1,3) which in addition to 4 bosonic directions has
4 grassmann fermionic directions. six bosonic coordinates corresponding to the group so(1, 3)
(which extends the coset superspace osp(1|4)
so(1,3) to the supergroup manifold osp(1|4)) are a non
abelian generalization of the central charge coordinates of the d = 4 model considered above.
it appears that our model with central charges can be regarded as an appropriate truncation of
the osp(1|4) model. work in this direction is now in progress.

we should also remark that tensorial central charges are usually associated with brane
charges, which are topological and take discrete (quantum) values. in contrast, in the superpar-
ticle models considered in this paper the central charges take continuous values and parametrize
compact manifolds, while their fourier conjugate coordinates are quantized.

a1. quantization of one fermionic degree of freedom by a half-conversion
prescription

here we shall present a method of quantizing a single fermionic variable alternative to that used
in subsection 3.1.4, but which leads to the same spectrum of quantum states.

let us convert the secondclass constraint (3.34) into the rstclass constraint by introducing

one more cliord-like variable

using  we replace (3.34) by the rst class constraint

{a,a}p = 0,

was introduced. it is required to ensure the anticommutativity of the grassmann and cliord
part of the rst class constraint (6.6).
indeed, let us calculate the square of the quantum
constraint (6.5)

a2

2{ a, a} =  2 + (

(6.8)

since

and

( 




)2 =

1
2{( 




), ( 




)} = 1

 2 = i = ( )2,

one easily nds that the rst two terms in (6.8) cancel and arrives at

a2 = ( 




)

1
2{ , }.

(6.9)

(6.10)

the last input vanishes if and only if { , } = 0. this result can not be reached if one chose  
to be the unit matrix.  and   can be chosen to be two pauli matrices.
let us stress that the necessity to introduce the second matrix   is a peculiarity of the
quantization of the odd number of cliord variables.   can be the unit matrix in the case of
even number of cliord variables (see e.g. [48] and references therein).

to x the representation for the matrices  and   one has to note that the conservation of

the grassmann parity in the form of the rst class constraint (6.6) requires that

 the components () and () of (6.3) must have dierent grassmann parity. for in-

stance, if we choose () to be bosonic supereld then () is fermionic.

 if the diagonal representation is chosen for one of the matrices, say  , then another matrix

 is antidiagonal.

taking these in mind we choose

  = 3  (cid:18) 1

 = 1  (cid:18) 0

1

1

0(cid:19) .

then the quantum constraints (6.6) acquire the form

aabb    (  

1

 )

1

(  

() (cid:19)b

=   (  

()  (  

 )() + ()

 )()! = 0,

which splits into two equations

0

0 1(cid:19) ,
 )!(cid:18) ()

( 




)() = (),

() = ( 




)()

(6.11)

(6.12)

(6.13)

using (6.9), we notice that the second equation is a consequence of the rst one. the rst
equation

( 




)() = ()

(6.14)

expresses the fermionic supereld through the bosonic one. i.e. if we write () in components

then from eq. (6.14) it follows that

() = 0 + i1,

() = i1  0.

thus, we can represent the spectrum of states carrying one cliord degree of freedom by
one (either bosonic or fermionic) supereld () depending on the single grassmann variable 

 = ,

2 = 0.

this result is in accordance with that of subsection 3.1.4 (see also [27]), and both methods
of quantizing a single fermionic variable result in the same eld content of quantum states (one
boson and one fermion).

a2. quantization of the high-dimensional model with the use of conversion

here we present some details of getting the wave function (5.18) from the converted system
of constraints (5.14), (5.15) and (5.16) describing the high-dimensional generalization of the
rstquantized a = 1 model.

let us choose the (super)coordinate representation for supercoordinates and bosonic spinors

p = i



x  ,

p 
() = i




,

 = i





and use the 2  2 matrix representation

 =

1
2

2 = (cid:18) 0 1
1 0(cid:19) ,

{, } =

1
2

.

for the cliord variable .

then the the wave function is a column

a = a(x , ) = (cid:18) (x  , , )
(x  , ) (cid:19)

(6.15)

(6.16)

(6.17)

(6.18)

with the elements carrying opposite grassmann parity (e.g.  is bosonic and  is fermionic)
and the quantum rst class constraints (5.14), (5.15), (5.16) should be taken in the form

 = i(  i) i

d = d +   = i(  i)3 + 2).

(6.19)

(6.20)

the incorporation of the 3 matrix is necessary to provide the properties of the rst class

constraints to form the closed algebra

this is a peculiarity of the quantization of the models with odd number of phase space grass-
mann variables (see section a1. of this appendix).

{ d, d} = 2i .

(6.21)

the further steps of the quantization procedure exactly repeat the steps of the d = 4 case

(see section 4). the wave function describing the spectrum of the quantum states is

a = e

i
2

 x (cid:18)

(a, )

i ( + ) (a, ).(cid:19)

(6.22)

as the second element in the column is expressed through the rst one, we can describe the
spectrum of the quantum states by the single supereld (5.18) depending on bosonic  and
fermionic  = ().
