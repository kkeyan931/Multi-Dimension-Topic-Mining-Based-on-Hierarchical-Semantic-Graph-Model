abstract

the constraints implied by analyticity in two-dimensional factorised s-matrix the-
ories are reviewed. whenever the theory is not time-reversal invariant, it is argued
that the generally assumed condition of real analyticity for the s-matrix ampli-
tudes has to be superseded by a dierent one known as hermitian analyticity.
examples are provided of integrable quantum eld theories whose (diagonal) two-
particle s-matrix amplitudes are hermitian analytic but not real analytic. it is also
shown that hermitian analyticity ensures that the notion of unitarity in the quan-
tum group approach to factorised s-matrices is always equivalent to the genuine
unitarity of the s-matrix .

it is well known that the s-matrix of an integrable two-dimensional quantum eld
theory factorises into products of two-particle amplitudes. then, the property of fac-
torisation itself and the usual axioms of s-matrix theory constrain the allowed form of
the s-matrix to such an extent that it becomes possible to conjecture its form. namely,
consistency with factorisation translates into the yang baxter equation while, on gen-
eral grounds, it is assumed that the s-matrix exhibits unitarity, crossing symmetry,
analyticity, and satises the bootstrap equations [1] (for a nice recent review see [2]
and the references therein).

in addition to this, most of the works on factorised s-matrices assume real analyt-
icity. this means that two-particle amplitudes are not only analytic functions of their
arguments, but they take complex-conjugate values at complex-conjugate points. how-
ever, this is not required by the usual s-matrix axioms and, in fact, it has been recently
realised that real analyticity does not always lead to consistent s-matrices.

the aim of this letter is to review the consequences of analyticity for two-dimensional
s-matrix amplitudes, and to serve as a reminder that real analyticity is not essential. it
is just a special case of a general condition known as hermitian analyticity [3] which is
valid only when the theory happens to be time-reversal symmetric. for the two-particle
s-matrix amplitudes, we will deduce the form of the hermitian analyticity constraints
which are given by eq. (20) and constitute our main result.

we also provide several examples where real analyticity is not satised. all of them
involve non-parity invariant integrable eld theories with diagonal s-matrices. the sim-
plest is a fermion model proposed by federbush in 1960 [4, 5]. the others are dierent
quantum eld theories associated with the non-abelian ane toda equations recently
constructed in [6, 7, 8]. in all these cases, the scattering amplitudes between dierent
particles are not real analytic.
instead, those amplitudes connected through a parity
transformation are related in such a way that real analyticity would be satised if the
theory becomes parity invariant. this unusual analyticity condition is just a consequence
of hermitian analyticity.

other cases where real analyticity becomes problematic arise in the quantum group
approach to factorised s-matrices [9] and, in particular, to (abelian) ane toda eld
theories with imaginary coupling constant [10]. there, takacs and watts have recently
highlighted that some of the resulting s-matrices are not unitary [11]. to be precise,
in this approach the role of unitarity is played by another condition called r-matrix
unitarity (ru). then, if real analyticity is enforced, it turns out that ru is equivalent
to physical unitarity only if the theory exhibits time-reversal symmetry [11]. we will
show that hermitian analyticity actually ensures that ru is always equivalent to physical
unitarity without any extra requirements.

an excellent classical review of analyticity in s-matrix theory is provided by the book
of eden et al. [12], which will be our main reference in the following. analyticity is the
assumption that the physical s-matrix amplitudes are real boundary values of analytic
functions as a consequence of causality and the existence of macroscopic time. on top of
this, the unitarity equations are expected to evaluate the discontinuities of those analytic
functions across their normal-threshold cuts. this requires that the physical s- and s-
matrix amplitudes are opposite boundary values of the same analytic functions, which
states the property known as hermitian analyticity [3, 12].

let us consider a generic integrable theory whose spectrum consists of several de-
generate multiplets labelled by a set of nite dimensional vector spaces va, vb, . . . with

1

dierent masses ma, mb, . . .. particles in the same multiplet will be distinguished by a
avour index i and, for simplicity, we will assume that all these particles are bosonic.
since the theory is integrable, the only non-vanishing (connected) two-particle s-matrix
amplitudes are of the form

h~kak, ~kbl | s  1 | ~pai, ~pbj i = (2)2 (2)(pai + pbj  kak  kbl) i mab

ijkl ,

(1)

where |~pai, ~pbj i is the state of two particles with mass ma and mb, and momentum ~pai
and ~pbj :

|~pai, ~pbj i = a

ai(~pai) a

bj (~pbj )|0i .

(2)

lorentz invariance allows one to decompose the scattering amplitude into scalar and
pseudoscalar parts:

mab

ijkl = m ab

ijkl(s) + 4 p

aip

bj p ab

ijkl(s) ,

(3)

where m ab
only.

ijkl(s) and p ab

ijkl(s) are functions of the mandelstam variable s = (pai + pbj )2

ijkl and p ab

analyticity postulates that the scalar and pseudoscalar components of the scattering
amplitudes, m ab
ijkl, are boundary values of analytic functions. this means
that they can be continued to complex values of s, and that the resulting functions are
analytic. in this case, since the theory is integrable, they should exhibit only two cuts
along s  (ma + mb)2 and s  (ma  mb)2 on the real axis with square root branching
points, corresponding to physical processes in the s- and t-channel, respectively. then,
the physical s-channel amplitudes are given by the limit onto the cut from the upper-half
complex s-plane,

m ab phys

ijkl

(s) = lim
0+

m ab

ijkl(s + i) ,

p ab phys

ijkl

(s) = lim
0+

p ab

ijkl(s + i) ,

(4)

which is the generalization of the well known feynmans i prescription in perturbation
theory.

hermitian analyticity goes one step beyond. it postulates that the physical s- and
s-matrix amplitudes are opposite boundary values of the same analytic functions, a
property that has been proved in perturbation theory [3], in potential theory [13], and
using s-matrix theory alone [14] (see [12] and the references therein). since

h~kak, ~kbl | s  1 | ~pai, ~pbj i = h~pai, ~pbj | s  1 | ~kak, ~kbli ,

this condition can be written as

hm ab phys

klij

(s)i

= lim
0+

m ab

ijkl(s  i) ,

(5)

(6)

and a similar equation for p ab
and m ab
g(z) = [f (z)], hermitian analyticity results in the following relationships:

ijkl(s)
klij(s) are analytic functions of s, and using that if f (z) is analytic so also is

ijkl. therefore, taking into account that both m ab

m ab

ijkl(s) = [m ab

klij(s)] ,

p ab
ijkl(s) = [p ab

klij(s)] .

(7)

an immediate and vital consequence of hermitian analyticity is that the unitarity equa-
tions ss = 1 evaluate the discontinuities of m ab
ijkl(s) across the two-
particle cuts [3, 15].

ijkl(s) and p ab

2

in two-dimensions, it is customary to use rapidities instead of momenta,

(p0

ai, ~pai) = (ma cosh ai , ma sinh ai) .

(8)

then, the (real) mandelstam variable s is a function of the absolute value of the rapidity
dierence of the colliding particles  = |ai  bj | > 0,

s = (pa + pb)2 = m2

a + m2

b + 2 ma mb cosh  ,

(9)

and the two-particle amplitudes become functions of . understood as complex variables,
the change of variables between s and  allows one to open the two cuts. hence, m ab
ijkl()
and p ab
ijkl() are meromorphic and the physical sheet is mapped into the region 0  im 
, which is the rst riemann sheet in the complex -plane.

regarding analyticity, notice that

lim
0+

m ab

ijkl(s  i) = m ab

ijkl() ,

 > 0 .

(10)

therefore, since the amplitudes are meromorphic functions of , the hermitian analyticity
relationships (7) translate into

m ab

ijkl() = [m ab

klij()] ,

p ab
ijkl() = [p ab

klij()] .

(11)

finally, let us consider the full s-matrix amplitude corresponding to (1):

h~kak, ~kbl | s | ~pai, ~pbj i = 4(2)2(ai  ak)(bj  bl) s ab

ijkl ,

(12)

where

s ab

ijkl = ikjl + i

mab

ijkl

4mamb sinh 

= ikjl + i  m ab

4mamb sinh 

ijkl()

+ p ab

ijkl() sign(ai  bj )! ,

and we have used that

4 p

aip

bj = 4mamb sinh(ai  bj ) = 4mamb sinh  sign(ai  bj ) ,

together with the usual relativistic normalization

h~pbj | ~paii = ab ij (2) 2p0

ai (~pai  ~pbj ) .

(13)

(14)

(15)

using the heaviside function (x) = 0 if x < 0 and = 1 if x > 0, eq. (13) can be

written as

where

s ab

ijkl = (ai  bj ) sab

kl
ij () + (bj  ai) sba

nm
ji () ,

sab

kl

ij () = ikjl + i  m ab

4mamb sinh 

ijkl()

(16)

(17)

is the scattering amplitude of the process where particle ai initially is on the left-hand
side of particle bj, while

sba

lk

ji() = ikjl + i  m ab

4mamb sinh 

ijkl()

 p ab

ijkl()! ,

(18)

is the amplitude of the process where ai initially is on the right-hand side of bj.
in
the symbolic algebraic notation commonly used to describe two-dimensional factorised
s-matrix theories [1, 2], these amplitudes correspond to

ai() bj() = xk,l
bj() ai() = xk,l

sab

kl

ij (  ) bl() ak() ,

sba

lk

ji(  ) ak() bl() ,

(19)

where    is real and positive for physical processes in the s-channel.

the two-particle amplitudes sab

kl
ij and sba

lk
ji are analytic functions of . moreover,

taking into account (11), (17), and (18), they satisfy

sab

kl

ij () = hsba

ji

lk()i

(20)

which summarises hermitian analyticity in two-dimensional factorised s-matrix theories
and is our central result.

the most important consequence of (20) is that the scattering amplitudes are not real
analytic functions unless they exhibit additional symmetry properties. to spell this out,
recall the behaviour of the two-particle s-matrix amplitudes with respect to parity (p)
and time-reversal (t):

p : sab

kl
ij ()  sba

lk
ji() ,

t : sab

kl
ij ()  sba

ji
lk() .

(21)

this shows that real analyticity is a special case of hermitian analyticity which is valid
only when the amplitude happens to be symmetric with respect to time-reversal trans-
formations, a conclusion that could have been anticipated on general grounds [12].

another important consequence of (20) concerns the formulation of the unitarity con-

dition. for real  > 0, the unitarity of the s-matrix, ss = 1, translates into

sab

xk,l

kl

ij ()hsab

kl

ij ()i

= ii jj  .

(22)

however, using the hermitian analyticity condition (20), unitarity can be equivalently
written as

sab

kl
ij () sba

xk,l

j i
lk () = ii jj  ,

(23)

which is nothing else than the condition of r-matrix unitarity (ru) that arises naturally
in the quantum group approach to factorised s-matrices [9, 10, 11]. actually, to be precise,
ru is the analytic continuation of (23) to the complex -plane. therefore, we conclude
that there is no dierence between the quantum group inspired r-matrix unitarity and
physical unitarity if the s-matrix amplitudes exhibit hermitian analyticity.

in the rest of the letter, we provide several examples where hermitian analyticity holds
but real analyticity is not satised. all of them correspond to diagonal s-matrix theories

4

where the multiplets are not degenerate and, hence, no avour indices are needed. then,
the hermitian analyticity condition (20) simplies to

sab() = hsba()i

.

(24)

it is worth noticing that, in the diagonal case, the p and t transformations of the s-
matrix amplitudes are identical. this explains why all our examples involve non-parity
invariant theories.

our rst example will be the federbush model [4], which was studied in great detail,
among others, by schroer, truong, and weisz [5]. the federbush model describes two
massive dirac elds i and ii whose interaction lagrangian is

lfm =  2  j 

i j 

ii ,

(25)

i and j 

where j 
ii are the conserved vector currents of the dirac elds. the two-particle
s-matrix amplitudes of the federbush model are particularly simple and can be written
as [5]

si,i() = sii,ii() = 1 ,

si,ii() = e 2i ,

sii,i() = e +2i .

(26)

since they are given just by rapidity independent phase factors, the amplitudes si,ii and
sii,i are clearly not real analytic. however, it is straightforward to check that they
satisfy eq. (24) or, in other words, that the s-matrix of the federbush model is hermitian
analytic.

the second example is provided by the integrable perturbation of the so(3)k wess-
zumino-witten model discussed by brazhnikov in [8]. 1 the spectrum of stable funda-
mental (or basic) particles consists just of two particles  and  associated with the two
simple roots of su(2), the lie algebra of so(3), whose mass can be taken to be dierent.
the two-particle scattering amplitude for  and  has been calculated at tree level in [8],
and the result is

s() =   162

k !2  1 +

2i

k sinh(  0)! = [s()] ,

(27)

where 0 is a non-vanishing real constant whose value depends on the coupling constants
of the model. these tree level amplitudes are not real analytic but, on the contrary, they
satisfy the hermitian analyticity condition eq. (24).

as our last example, let us consider the homogenous sine-gordon (hsg) theories
constructed in [6]. there is a hsg theory for each simple compact lie group g that
corresponds to an integrable perturbation of the conformal eld theory (cft) associated
with the coset gk/u(1)rg, where rg is the rank of g, or, equivalently, of the theory of
level-k g-parafermions [7]. the semiclassical spectrum of stable particles of the hsg
theories has been obtained in [16]. if the group g is simply laced, the spectrum consists
of k  1 particles for each simple root ~i of g, the lie algebra of g, whose masses are
given by

m~i(n) =

k


m~i sin(cid:18) n

k (cid:19) ,

i = 1, . . . , rg ,

n = 1, . . . , k  1 .

(28)

1using the construction of ref. [6], the model of brazhnikov can be described as a symmetric space
sine-gordon (sssg) theory associated with the compact type-i symmetric space su (3)/so(3), and it is
expected that many other sssg theories exhibit similar properties.

5

in this equation,

m~i = 2mq(~i  ~+) (~i  ~) ,

(29)
the constant m is the only dimensionful parameter of the theory, and ~ are continuous
vector coupling constants taking values in the fundamental weyl chamber of the cartan
subalgebra of g. for a generic choice of ~, all these masses will be dierent, and an exact
diagonal s-matrix for these theories has been recently proposed [17]. for our purposes,
it will be enough to quote the result for g = su(3). for the fundamental particles,
corresponding to n = 1 in (28), the two-particle amplitudes can be written as

s~j ,~j () =

sinh 1
sinh 1

2 ( + 2
2(  2

k i)
k i)

,

j = 1, 2 ,

s~1,~2() = e 

k i sinh 1
sinh 1

2(    
2(   + 

k i)
k i)

= [s~2,~1()] ,

(30)

where the value of the real parameter  depends on the coupling constants ~, and 
can be taken to be +1 or 1. eq. (30) provides a set of diagonal two-particle s-matrix
amplitudes that satisfy unitarity, crossing symmetry, and the bootstrap equations [17].
however, they are hermitian analytic and not real analytic.

to sum up, our main point was to recall that real analyticity is not essential in s-
matrix theory; it is just a special case of a general property called hermitian analyticity.
then, we have derived the constraints implied by hermitian analyticity for the two-
particle scattering amplitudes in two-dimensional factorised s-matrix theories, which are
summarised by eq. (20). these constraints agree with the properties of the scattering
amplitudes of several non-parity invariant integrable theories already discussed in the
literature [4, 5, 8, 17]. in addition, they also manifest that real analyticity is recovered
only for those amplitudes which are time-reversal invariant.

an important consequence of hermitian analyticity is that it ensures the equivalence
between the genuine unitarity of the s-matrix and the condition of unitarity satised by
the s-matrices derived from the quantum group construction of refs. [9, 10]. however, in
this construction, it is generally assumed that two-particle amplitudes are real analytic,
which, according to our results, might be the origin of most of the problems with unitarity
highlighted in [11].

recall that there is no general reason why the s-matrix of a two-dimensional integrable
theory has to be time-reversal or parity symmetric. this is particularly obvious in the
lk
approach of [9, 10] where most of the two-particle scattering amplitudes sab
ji
are derived independently using the bootstrap equations. thus, it is virtually impossible
to impose time-reversal (or parity) invariance a priori and, instead, one has to check
whether or not it holds. actually, it does not hold even for the simplest ane toda eld
theories associated with a(1)
2 , which is reected in their reported non-unitarity [11].
in our opinion, all this makes necessary to revise the construction of those s-matrices
which fail to be time-reversal invariant by implementing hermitian analyticity in the
porcedure of refs. [9, 10].
