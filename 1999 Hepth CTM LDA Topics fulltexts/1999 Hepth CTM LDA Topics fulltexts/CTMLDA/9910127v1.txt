abstract

by performing the canonical quantization of the abelian chern-simons model
on the light-front (as suggested by dirac), we clarify some controversies ap-
pearing in recent papers that discuss the relation between the existence of
excitations carrying fractional spin and statistics (anyons) and this model.
properties of the chern-simons model on the light-front are investigated in
detail, following the dirac method for constrained dynamical systems, both
for a coupled complex scalar eld as well as for a spinor eld.

1 introduction

dirac [1], in 1949, noticed that it is possible to quantize dynamical systems on any
space-like surface, in particular a plane wave front moving with the speed of light, dened
by the condition x0 + x3 = const. for simplicity we shall call that method light-front
quantization (lf), in contrast to the usual equal-time quantization (also referred to as
instant form).

lf has some advantages in that seven out of the ten poincare generators (in 4 dimen-
sions) are kinematical, while in the instant form only six have this property. it should also
be noticed that non-locality with rescpect to the longitudinal coordinate x is expected
in the lf, because it happens that the commutators are non-vanishing everywhere on

1

the light-like lines of the light-front hyperplane [2]. in addition, lf always gives rise to
constrained lagrangians, demanding the use of the well-known dirac procedure in order
to construct the hamiltonian.

in 1966, weinberg [3] obtained feynman rules in the innite momentum frame. in
1970, kogut and soper [4] proved that those rules correspond to lf quantization. even
before [5], making p   was used to derive current algebra sum rules, and it was
noticed that this is the same as using some lf commutators of the currents.
recently, interest in lf quantization has been renewed [6, 7] due to the diculties in
the calculation of non-perturbative eects in the instant form qcd. it occurs that, due
to infrared slavery, the qcd vacuum contains gluonic and fermionic condensates. on the
lf, one obtains a simpler vaccum, often coincident with the perturbative vacuum. this
is so because, for a massive particle on the mass shell, its lf momentum components,
k, are positive denite, thus not allowing the excitation of these degrees of freedom on
the lf vacuum, in view of conservation of total longitudinal momentum.

in the context of string theory lf has been used, for example, in the case of heterotic
string [8]. recently, lf has also been used to treat the chiral schwinger model [9, 10].
on the other hand, chern-simons models [11, 12] have been used to treat planar
condensed matter physics systems, for instance, low temperature superconductivity and
quantum hall eect [13].

in this paper, we apply lf quantization to abelian chern-simons model in 2+1
dimensions [14], coupled to scalar or spinor elds. as already pointed out, we make use
of dirac procedure to treat the resulting constrained systems. our main goal is to clarify
the relation between chern-simons systems and the existence, due to commutation of
rotations and no a priori quantization of angular momentum, of excitations carrying
fractional spin and statistics (anyons) [11, 12].
in section 2, we treat chern-simons
coupled to a complex scalar eld. in section 3, we treat coupling to a fermionic eld. in
setion 4, we compare both and discuss our results.

2 chern-simons coupled to scalar elds

we begin by dening the lf coordinates (in 2+1 dimensions)

x =

x0x2
2

= x.

(1)

we shall adopt x+   as our time coordinate, while x is our spatial longitudinal com-
ponent. the remaining component x1 is the spatial transverse component also referred
to as x. therefore the greek indices run through +,, 1 while the latin indices take the

2

values , 1. the lf coordinates are clearly not related to the usual ones by any lorentz
transformation.

the theory to be treated here is given by the following lagrangian density:

l = (d)( d) + aaa,

(2)

where a is a constant,  is a complex scalar minimally coupled to the abelian gauge eld
a by means of the covariant derivative

d = ( + ia)
d = (  ia).

the gauge-invariant noether current

j = ie(d   d)

is conserved.

the eld equations are easily obtained and read as below

(a+)

+ =

i
2d1d1  ia+

d1 d1 + ia+ +
+ =

2aa1 = j+ = i(  )
2a(1a+  +a1) = j = i(d+   d+)
 2aa+ = j1 = i(d1   d1),

i

(a+)

after we choose the gauge a  0.
the -eld satisfy null boundary conditions at spatial innity (x, x1), while the
gauge eld satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions at innite x and null at innite
x1. the anti-periodic boundary conditions are in order to allow non-zero electric charge:

q = z d2x j+ = 2az dx1 [a1(x = , x1)  a1(x = , x1)].

(11)

by calculating the canonically conjugate momenta, ,  and , we conclude that

this is a constrained system, and the constraints are given by

+  0

i  i  a+ijaj  0
    d  0
    d  0.

i, j = , 1

(12)
(13)
(14)
(15)

the canonical hamiltonian is obtained in the usual way (after integrating by parts):

hc = z d2x h(d1)( d1)  a+i ,

where

 = i(  ) + a+ijiaj + ii.

now, we apply the dirac procedure. demanding the persistence in time of the con-
straints, we obtain   0. so, we end up with two rst class constraints, +  0 and
  0, wich generate the gauge transformations. the others are second class. the pair
a+, + decouples, so we only have to deal with . we consistently add the constraint
a  0 (thus justifying our choice on the eld equations).

we are ready to dene the dirac brackets,

{f, g}d = {f, g}  z d2u d2v {f, tm(u)} c 1

mn(u, v) {tn(v), g},

(18)

(16)

(17)

(19)

(20)

where tm stands for one of the constraints i, , , a and , and cmn(x, y) =
{tm(x), tn(y)}. the constraint matrix is inverted and we obtain for c 1
0

being (x) the signal function. this function is antiperiodic at innite x as long as
the above discussed boundary conditions are concerned. the constraint   0 gives, in
accordance with the eld equations,

a1 =

1

4a z d2y(x  y)(x1  y1)j+(y),

(21)

and the same boundary condition considerations apply. with a and a+ eliminated in
view of the constraints, this leaves only  and  as independent elds.

by eliminating the constraints, we obtain self-consistently the lf hamiltonian

h l.f. = z d2x(d1)( d1).

4

(22)

this hamiltonian has non-local features as discussed in the introduction. we also obtain
easily:

{, }d = {, }d = 0
{, }d = {, }d = k(x  y)
{, }d = {, }d = 
i
[4(x)k(x  y) + 2(x  y)]

{a1, a1}d =

2(x  y)

(23)
(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

when checking the self-consistency, we try to recover the eld equations using this
brackets. so, we are led to dene

a+  

1

4a z d2y (x  y)(x1  y1)j1(y),

(29)

that is identical to a+. this means that, although decoupled throughout the dirac
procedure, this component must obey the above denition. at the end, we recover
the eld equations, having done a = 0 as a gauge condition, either in lagrangian or
hamiltonian formalism.

we are ready to outline the construction of the fock states. the dirac bracket are

promoted to commutators,

[, ] = ik(x  y)
[, ] = 0.

(30)
(31)

in order to satisfy them, we use the momentum space expansions

 =

 =

2 z d2k
2 z d2k

(k+)
2k+ ha(k+, k1;  )ei(k+xk1x1) + b(k+, k1;  )ei(k+xk1x1)i
(k+)
2k+ ha(k+, k1;  )ei(k+xk1x1) + b(k+, k1;  )ei(k+xk1x1)i , (33)

(32)

where d2k = dk+dk1 and  is the heaviside step function, and with

[a(k), a(k)] =  = [b(k), b(k)] =  = 2(k  k) = (k+  k+)(k1  k1),

(34)

5

if we notice that a1 is a pure gauge,

a1 = 1

(x) =

1

8a z d2y (x  y)(x1  y1)j+(y),

then we may dene

 = ei,

and rewrite the hamiltonian as a free one in the eld 

h = z d2x(1

)(1

).

the -eld does not have a vanishing dirac bracket with itself,

[ (x), (y)] = e(x,y)[ei(x), ei(y)](y)(x) +

+

1

2 hei(x)ei(y)(y, x1)(y)(1  e(x,y))  (x  y)i

where

(x, y) = 

i
8a

(x  y)(x1  y1).

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

this is the equivalent on the lf of the equal-time graded commutation relations, ex-
hibiting manifestly fractional statistics. due to the boundary conditions, though, the
phase factor  is single-valued on the lf, while its equal-time equivalents expression
includes an angle and therefore is multi-valued [12].

it has been shown [14] that anyonicity seems not to be related to rotational anomaly
(the latter being a gauge artifact), but rather to the dynamics of the cs system, as given
by the hamiltonian and the dirac brackets.

3 chern-simons coupled to spinor elds

we shall use the following representation of the gamma-matrices in 2+1 dimensions:

0 = 1
1 = i3
2 = i2.

it will be useful to dene the lf components of the gamma-matrices

 

1
2

(0  2)

(41)
(42)
(43)

(44)

and the projectors

(45)

our theory is now dened by (writing the spinorial indices explicitly for later conve-

nience):

l =

i

2 h

(0)d  d

(0)i + aaa,

where the denition of the covariant derivative still holds.

the gauge-invariant conserved noether current now reads

j = 

(0).

the eld equations in the gauge a  0 are
2 1  i d12 = 0
2 d+2 + i d11 = 0
2a(a1) = j+ = 2 
2a(1a+  +a1) = j = 2 
 2a(a+) = j1 = i(1

12).

(46)

(47)

(48)
(49)
(50)
(51)
(52)

notice that the rst eld equation has no time derivatives, turning out to be a constraint
in the hamiltonian formalism. the elds obey boundary conditions similar to the former
case.

we calculate the conjugate momenta,  and , obtaining the constraints

   

i
2

(0+)  0

+  0
i  i  a+ijaj  0.

(53)

(54)
(55)

(here 1 is conjugate to 1 and 1 is conjugate to a1). the canonical hamiltonian is

hc = z d2x(cid:26) i

2 h( di

)(0i)  

(0i)(di)i  a+(cid:27) ,

(56)

where

(57)
as before,   0 is a secondary constraint. further, the persistence in time of 
gives another secondary constraint, that we shall call   0. , as we expect, is exactly

 = i(  



) + a+ijiaj + ii.



7

so, we dene the dirac brackets, now with tm(x) being 1, 2, 

the rst of the eld equations, as long as we set a  0. this last choice is necessary,
again, in order to render the matrix of the poisson brackets of the constraints invertible.
2, , 1, ,
, a and . the resulting matrix is then inverted. we have developed a technique
to simplify the inversion of the symmetric 10  10 matrix. it occurs that the matrix is
sparse, so we can take advantage of this fact, by rst determining wich elements of the
inverse are necessarily zero. by doing this, we lower from 55  55 to 10  10 the system
to eectively determine, with the latter being already block diagonal.

1, 

as before, the pair + and a+ decouples. the constraint  = 0 gives

a1(x) = 
and now, in addition,  = 0 gives

2
a z d2yk(x  y)2(y)

2(y),

1 = i2 z d2yk(x  y)dy

12(y),

leaving 2 and 

2 as the only independent degrees of freedom.

the lf hamiltonian ends up being

h l.f. =

1

2 z d2x [

2(11) + (1

1)2  2aa1a+] ,

and we now calculate the folowing dirac brackets:

2(x  y)

i
2
2(x  y)

{2, 2}d = 0
{2, 
2}d = 
1
{2, 2}d =
2
{2, j+}d = i22(x  y)
{2, a1}d = 
{j+, j+}d = 0
{a1, a1}d = 0.

(58)

(59)

(60)

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

(66)
(67)

now, the charge density commutes with itself, and eq. (62) yields a local commutator,
in contrast with the case of the scalar eld. we consistently recover the eld equations
in the hamiltonian formalism.

8

we can also build up the fock states here, satisfying

[2, 

2]+ =

1
2

2(x  y),

by using

2 =

2

with

1

4 2 z d2k ha(k+, k1;  )ei(k+xk1x1) + b(k+, k1;  )ei(k+xk1x1)i ,

3

(68)

(69)

[a(k), a(k)] =  = [b(k), b(k)] =  = 2(k  k) = (k+  k+)(k1  k1).

(70)

the remainder of the construction follows as usual.

we can dene a 2,

2 = ei2

(x) =

1

8a z d2y(x  y)(x1  y1)j+(y).

(71)

(72)

now, if we use the brackets above, the equivalent of the graded anti-commutation relation
of the equal time formulation reads in the lf

[ 2, 2]+ = 0.

(73)

this is also in contrast with the case of the scalar eld.

4 discussion and nal remarks

we have treated an abelian chern-simons model minimally coupled to a complex scalar
eld and a spinor eld separately, using a non-covariant gauge, on the lf. using the
canonical approach and the dirac procedure for the resulting constrained system, we
have obtained a non-local hamiltonian with sixth-order interactions, and showed the
self-consistency of our treatment. the gauge eld has been eliminated, leaving just the
2 matter degrees of freedom. we outlined the construction of the fock states, in terms
of creation and annihilation operators.

we have dened, in the terms of the equal-time formalism, a dual description, in
wich the the matter elds are multivalued and the hamiltonian has been claimed to be
a free one.
it happens that in the equal-time formalism this can not be so, because

9

having a multivalued eld inside an integral would force us to choose a branch, in order
to integrate, thus introducing a discontinuity and a delta-like interaction. on the other
hand, on the lf, we do not have multivalued elds, in view of our boundary conditions.
so, our hamiltonian written in terms of the dual description eld is indeed a free one.
this dual description eld is single-valued, but does not have usual statisatics, at least
in the case of the scalar eld.

the spinor eld has a local dirac bracket, in spite of the fact that this was not
necessary in view of the lf coordinates, and it also has a vanishing anti-commutator
with itself. what remains to be interpreted is the meaning of the null anti-commutator
on the lf.

the next natural step should be to analyse a model with a self-interaction potential,
leading to vortex-like congurations. the above mentioned boundary conditions should
play a central role in such a case.
