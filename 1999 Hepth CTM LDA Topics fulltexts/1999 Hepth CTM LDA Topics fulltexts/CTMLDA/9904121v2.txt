abstract

prepotentials in n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theories are known to obey

non-linear partial dierential equations called witten-dijkgraaf-verlinde-verlinde

(wdvv) equations. in this paper, the prepotentials at one-instanton level in n = 2

supersymmetric su(4) yang-mills theory are studied from the standpoint of wdvv

equations. especially, it is shown that the one-instanton prepotentials are obtained

from wdvv equations by assuming the perturbative prepotential and by using the

scaling relation as a subsidiary condition but are determined without introducing

seiberg-witten curve. in this way, various one-instanton prepotentials which satisfy

both wdvv equations and scaling relation can be derived, but it turns out that

among them there exist one-instanton prepotentials which coincide with the instan-

ton calculus.

i. introduction

a class of developments of quantum eld theory in the ninety of this century may be represented

by two keywords: n = 2 supersymmetry and duality. for example, the mirror symmetry1,2,3,4 estab-

lished in the beginning of the ninety was based on the (trivial) isomorphism between left and right

u(1) currents of (2, 2)-superconformal eld theory,5,6 and this isomorphism predicted the existence

of a pair of calabi-yau manifolds whose axes of hodge diamond were exchanged. candelas et al.3,4

skillfully used the consequence expected from this duality of hodge structure and showed that the

numbers of rational curves on calabi-yau quintic 3-fold could be determined from mirror symmetry.

the coincidence of their result with mathematically rigorous results1,7,8 gave a great surprising!

on the other hand, also in the recent studies of low energy eective dynamics of n = 2 supersym-

metric yang-mills theory, n = 2 supersymmetry and duality play a crucial role. before the arrival

of seiberg and wittens proposal by using electro-magnetic duality for the description of the low en-

ergy eective action of su(2) gauge theory,9,10 though it has been known that the prepotential which

is a generating function of the low energy eective action is not renormalized beyond one-loop in

perturbative calculation due to n = 2 supersymmetry,11,12,13 actually the prepotential was expected

to receive instanton corrections.14 unfortunately, such corrections were not so extensively discussed,

but thanks to their proposal, it made possible to extract informations on instanton eects from a

riemann surface and periods of meromorphic dierential on it. namely, the low energy eective

theory was turned out to be parameterized by a riemann surface. the validity of their proposal

was discussed by klemm et al.15 with the aid of picard-fuchs equation and the instanton corrections

to the prepotential was revealed. the instanton corrections obtained in this way showed extremely

good agreement with the prediction of instanton calculus.16,17,18,19,20,21

however, deeper and striking features of prepotentials of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills

theories may be nicely interpreted in terms of dierential equations satised by prepotentials.

for instance,

it is well-known that the prepotentials satisfy an euler equation called scaling

relation,22,23,24,25,26 and in fact this simple equation simplied and accelerated the study of prepoten-

tials. as for another characteristic equations, we can mention that there is a non-linear system of

partial dierential equations called witten-dijkgraaf-verlinde-verlinde (wdvv) equations27,28,29,30,31

(rigorously speaking, the wdvv equations in n = 2 yang-mills theory are not equivalent to those

arising in two-dimensional topological eld theory32,33,34,35). actually, these equations hold not

2

only in four-dimensional gauge theories but also in higher dimensions even if hypermultiplets are

included.28,29 accordingly, it becomes possible to regard the prepotentials in various gauge theories

as a member of solutions to wdvv equations. then, what is the most general solution (function

form of prepotentials) to the wdvv equations? unfortunately, we can not precisely know the answer

to this question, but braden et al.36 partially found the answer. they assumed the function form

of prepotential which is expected from known examples and found a new prepotential which is con-

sidered as that in ve-dimensional gauge theory, although their study was restricted to perturbative

part. of course, among the solutions found by them we can see the existence of the prepotential

in four-dimensional yang-mills theory. this seems to indicate that the prepotentials can be con-

structed without introducing riemann surface, provided the wdvv equations are used. finding

whether non-perturbative prepotentials are available from wdvv equations without using riemann

surface is the subject of this paper.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec. ii, the construction of perturbative solution to wdvv

equations for su(4) gauge theory in four dimensions discussed by braden et al.36 is summarized.

we can see that the perturbative prepotential is in fact obtained from wdvv equations. in sec.

iii, we add the non-perturbative part for this perturbative prepotential and try to solve the wdvv

equations. though the non-perturbative part satises a non-linear dierential equation, restricting

it at one-instanton level, we can reduce it to a linear dierential equation satised by one-instanton

prepotential. for this reason, the one-instanton prepotential is investigated in this paper. to solve

this equation, the scaling relation is used as a subsidiary condition, but it turns out that there are

miscellaneous solutions which do not contradict to both wdvv equations and scaling relation. in

sec.

iv. we compare our result with the prediction of one-instanton calculus.

it is shown that

among our one-instanton prepotentials obtained from wdvv equations there are one-instanton

prepotentials which agree the prediction of instanton calculus. in this way, we conclude that it is

possible to obtain non-perturbative prepotential from wdvv equations without relying on riemann

surface. sec. v is a brief summary.

ii. perturbative prepotential from wdvv equations

in this section, we briey outline the construction to get perturbative prepotential from wdvv

equations in the su(4) gauge theory presented by braden et al.36 note that the su(4) model is the

3

simplest and non-trivial example for a study of wdvv equations.

in this case, the wdvv equations for the prepotential f take the form

(fi)(fk)1(fj) = (fj)(fk)1(fi), i, j, k = 1,    , 3,

where

(fi)  (fi)jk =

3f

aiajak

(2.1)

(2.2)

are the matrix notations and in this paper the brackets are always added as (fi) when fi mean

matrices. the coordinates ai are the periods of the su(4) gauge theory (see appendix).

braden et al.36 considered the perturbative prepotential in the form

fper(a1, a2, a3) =

4xi<j=1

f (aij), aij = ai  aj,

ai = 0.

4xi=1

(2.3)

of course fper may depend on the mass scale   8

su(4) of the theory, but we can ignore its

dependence for the moment because -dierentiation is not included in the wdvv equations (2.1).

under the assumption (2.3), we can nd that when fper satises (2.1) there is a functional relation

g(a12)g(a34)  g(a13)g(a24) + g(a14)g(a23) = 0,

where

g(a)   3f

a3!1

.

with the aid of several conditions, we can conclude that g is an odd function with

g(0) = g



(0) = 0,

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

where the prime means the dierentiation over the argument.36

there are several functions enjoying the properties (2.4) and (2.6), but a function which is nec-

essary for us among them is the function of the form g(a) = a. namely,

f (a) =

a2
2

ln a + o(a2).

(2.7)

note that o(a2)-term can not be xed from the wdvv equations because they are third-order

dierential equations. namely, -dependence of one-loop contribution is not xed. it is easy to see

4

that substituting (2.7) back to (2.3) in fact yields the perturbative part of the su(4) prepotential

(in a suitable normalization).

marshakov et al.29 give a general proof that the perturbative prepotentials in various gauge

theories satisfy wdvv equations, but this is also conrmed by ito and yang30 in their study of these

equations.

iii. one-instanton prepotentials

a. dierential equation for one-instanton prepotential

next, let us consider whether non-perturbative prepotential f is available from the wdvv

equations by assuming the form

f (a1, a2, a3, ) = fper(a1, a2, a3) + fins(a1, a2, a3, ),

where

fins(a1, a2, a3, ) =

fk(a1, a2, a3)k.

xk=1

(3.1)

(3.2)

in order to derive dierential equations for fins, we assume that fper is already given by (2.3) with

(2.7).

then substituting f into (2.1) we can obtain a single non-linear dierential equation for fins,

but if we restrict only the case k = 1 (one-instanton level), the equation reduces to

b. the solutions

in order to solve (3.3), let us introduce the new variables

x = a12, y = a13, z = a14.

in addition, using euler derivatives x = x/x etc, we can rewrite (3.3) as

l(x, y, z)f1 = 0,

where

l(x, y, z) = yz(y  z)x(x  1)(x  2) + z(4xy  3y2  2xz + yz)(x  1)xy

(3.5)

(3.6)

+z(3x2  4xy  xz + 2yz)(y  1)xy  xz(x  z)y(y  1)(y  2)

y(3x2  xy  4xz + 2yz)(z  1)xy  y(4xz + yz  3z2  2xy)(x  1)xz

+6(x  y)(x  z)(y  z)xyz + x(xz + 4yz  3z2  2xy)(y  1)yz

+x(3y2 + 2xz  4yz  xy)(z  1)yz + xy(x  y)z(z  1)(z  2).

(3.7)

here, suppose that f1 is given by

where

f1 = x1y2z3f (x, y, z),

f (x, y, z) =

xi,j,k=0

bxi,yj,zkxxiyyjzzk

(3.8)

(3.9)

and the expansion coecients are assumed to be independent of x, y and z.

in (3.9), x etc are

signature symbols (the choice of signatures depends on where is the convergence region), e.g., x = .

then from (3.3) we get the dierential equation for f

l(x + 1, y + 2, z + 3)f = 0.

(3.10)

and the indicial equations for i

1(1  22  1)(1 + 2  33  2) = 0, 2(21  2 + 1)(1 + 2  33  2) = 0,

2(2  23  1)(31  2  3 + 2) = 0, (2  3)(2
1

 1  12 + 23) = 0,

1(2

 31 + 52  312 + 3  13 + 423 + 2) = 0,

3 (3  32  3) + 5123 + 323  22

13 + 213 + 23 + 12 = 0,

2
3 (3  2  3)  22

2 3 + 3123 + 323 + 312 + 23 = 0.

(3.11)

the sets of possible i are thus given by

  (1, 2, 3) = (2, 2, 2), (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1)4, (0, 0, 0)2, (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2)2,

(0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 0)2, (1, 0, 0)2, (1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 0)2,

(3.12)

where the superscript means degeneracy, e.g., (0, 0, 0)2 is composed of two (0, 0, 0), but we do not

discuss the consequence of degeneracy in this paper. for the indices (3.12), it is straightforward to

obtain f . though we have expressed f in (3.9) as an innite series, actually we can restrict possible

terms in (3.9) by considering the degree counting of one-instanton prepotential.

c. scaling relation for one-instanton prepotential

if the wdvv equations can in fact yield a physically acceptable prepotential, the prepotential

obtained from those equations must also satisfy the fundamental homogeneity condition called scaling

relation.22,23,24,25,26 therefore, we may use it as a subsidiary condition for the problem how to solve

wdvv equations in gauge theory.

to see this, rstly, let us recall the scaling relation22,23,24,25,26

+ su(4)

f

su(4)

= 2f .

(3.13)

we need a scaling relation for f1 not for f itself, but in order to extract it from (3.13), the -

dependence of perturbative prepotential which can not be xed from wdvv equations must be

included appropriately. for this, our choice here is

then from (3.13), f1 is found to satisfy

+ 6f1 = 0,

which indicates that f1 is a homogeneous function of degree 6.

in the variables (3.5), (3.15) becomes

xxf1 + yyf1 + zz f1 + 6f1 = 0.

accordingly, from (3.8), (3.9) and (3.16) it must be always true that

1 + 2 + 3 + xi + yj + zk = 6.

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

d. examples of one-instanton prepotentials

we have now enough informations to construct explicit one-instanton prepotentials which do not

contradict to wdvv equations and scaling relation.

to begin with, let us consider the case   (x, y, z) = (+, +, +). in this case, we can easily nd

that there exists only one solution which satises (3.17). it is the solution with  = (2, 2, 2),

and thus

f1 =

b0,0,0
x2y2z2 .

(3.18)

however, when  = (, , ) or one entry of  diers to the others, e.g.,  = (, , +), the

situation changes, in particular, drastically in the latter case. in the former case, it is easy to see

that f consists of nite number of terms for all indices in (3.12), but in the latter case f is generally

represented by innite number of terms as long as (3.17) is satised. we do not know whether

it is possible to nd any physical meaning for this type of one-instanton prepotential, but it may

be interesting to recall that a similar one was observed in the one-instanton prepotential in the

ve-dimensional gauge theory.26

since the latter case mentioned above is slightly intractable, let us consider an example of the

former case instead. in the case of  = (1, 1, 1) with  = (, , ), for instance, we have

f1 =

1

xy2! + b1,1,1

x2y

1

x2z(cid:19)

(3.19)

1

note that (3.19) includes the one-instanton prepotential of the form (3.18).

in a similar manner, we can construct one-instanton prepotentials for all other possible values

of i, which do not contradict to both wdvv equations and scaling relation, but it would not be

necessary to explicitly show them here. however, we should point out that since (3.3) is a partial

dierential system we can expect that there exist more and more various solutions.

in fact, this

observation is right, and we can show that also in the variables

(x, y, z) = (a12, a23, a24), (a13, a23, a34)

(3.20)

we can construct miscellaneous one-instanton prepotentials. among them one-instanton prepoten-

tials of the form (3.18) are included.

8

remark: the function form of the one-instanton prepotentials can be determined by solving the

wdvv equations, but its numerical factors, i.e., instanton expansion coecients, are not obtained

because they correspond to integration constants. in order to determine them, it is necessary to rewrite

the scaling relation as a relation between prepotential and moduli. then substituting the one-instanton

prepotential obtained from wdvv equations into this scaling relation, we will be able to get the

expansion coecients. of course, in this case the moduli must be represented as a function of periods

and its expansion coecients must be determined. however, since knowing moduli is equivalent to

introduce a seiberg-witten curve, this method based on scaling relation represented by using moduli

is not preferable in the formalism of wdvv equations because prepotentials available from wdvv

equations should be determined without introduction of seiberg-witten curves. accordingly, when

the determination of instanton expansion coecients is required, they should be determined from the

result of instanton calculus.

iv. one-instanton prepotential from instanton calculus

we have derived one-instanton prepotentials by solving the wdvv equations in the previous

section. though these one-instanton prepotentials satises the wdvv equations and the scaling

relation, unfortunately in view of wdvv equations we can not determine which ones are physically

acceptable. for this reason, in order to extract physically meaningful one-instanton prepotentials

among them, we must compare our result with the one-instanton prediction of instanton calculus.

in the case of su(4) gauge theory, one-instanton contribution for prepotential is given by17,18

where we have omitted the numerical normalization factor and

(4.1)

(4.2)

the closed form of one-instanton prepotential for su(nc) gauge theory is also obtained by solving

picard-fuchs equations37 and direct calculation of period integrals.38,39

note that (4.1) is a sum of (3.18) and those for (3.20)

up to constant factors. accordingly, we can conclude that the wdvv equations can yield physical

prepotential in spite of without introducing riemann surface.

v. summary

in this paper, we have discussed the non-perturbative prepotential of n = 2 supersymmetric

su(4) yang-mills theory in the standpoint of wdvv equations. especially, we have found a dif-

ferential equation for one-instanton prepotential and constructed its solutions. the method to get

prepotentials based on wdvv equations is fascinating in the point that the prepotentials can be ob-

tained without introducing seiberg-witten curves, but it has been shown that unfortunately too many

prepotentials exist in contrast with the approach based on seiberg-witten curves which uniquely de-

termines a prepotential. nevertheless, we have succeeded to show that one-instanton prepotentials

which coincide with the one-instanton calculus can be obtained from wdvv equations.

as for an another aspect of wdvv equations, we should mention a connection to topological

eld theory in two dimensions. from the appearance of wdvv equations, it may be natural to

think that the low energy eective theory is actually a kind of topological eld theory, but we must

notice that a priori there is no reason that the eective theory must be a topological eld theory.

therefore, topological or not topological: that is the question.

an approach to argue this implication more explicitly is to regard the seiberg-witten curves often

identied with spectral curves of integrable system as if they were superpotentials of topological cp 1

model.31 although this observation strongly relying on the existence of riemann surface (seiberg-

witten curve), it enables us to nd a connection to topological eld theory, specically, topological

string theory at genus zero level.31 then, even if we do not assume a riemann surface, can we nd

a topological nature of the eective theory? probably wdvv equations give the answer, but the

study is a subject in the future.
