abstract

an exact formula for the solutions to the wdvv equation in terms of horizontal sections of

the corresponding at connection is found.

1. introduction. the associativity equations (or wddv equations) appeared in the classication
problem for the topological eld theories at the early 90s, see [1], [2]. during the last years
these equations has attracted a great interest due to connections with the enumerative geometry
(gromov  witten invariants [5]), quantum cohomology [9] and the whitham theory [7].

in [3] it was noticed that the classication problem for the topological eld theories is equivalent
to the classication of the egoro metrics of special type. egoro metrics are at diagonal metrics

ds2 =

i (u)(dui)2,

i (u), where i = /ui. it turns out that for every egoro metric with the

such that ih2

which are the associativity conditions for the algebra kl = cm
function f (x) such that its third derivatives are equal to

klm. moreover, there exists a

in the topological eld theory with n primary elds k function f plays role of the partition
function. there also exist constants rm such that kl = rmcklm(x).

equations (3) and the existence of the function f such that (4) holds are equivalent to the

compatibility conditions of the linear system (see [3])

kl  cm

klm = 0,

(5)

where  is a spectral parameter.

in few special cases the function f was found explicitly (see [3], [6], [4]). however, in general
case an expression for f in terms of the at sections of the connection k = /xk  cm
kl has been
unknown. the main goal of these notes is to write down such an expression. it was motivated by
the results of [8], where explicit formulas for the algebraic-geometrical solutions to the associativity
equations were found. though the general formula of [8] (theorem 5.1) is correct, in the nal
formula (theorem 5.2) one of the terms was missed. here we take an opportunity to x it.

2. let us consider a solution ij(u) = ji(u) to the darboux  egoro system

kij = ikkj,

i 6= j 6= k;

n

xm=1

mij = 0,

i 6= j.

(6)

following [3] we x the unique egoro metric (1) corresponding to this solution by dening the
lame coecients hi(u) from the system

jhi(u) = ij(u)hj (u),

i 6= j,

ihi(u) = xj6=i

ij(u)hj (u),

(7)

and initial conditions hi(0) = 1, i = 1, . . . , n. this system is compatible due to (6). the condition
ij = ji implies that the above dened metric is in fact egoro metric.

the at coordinates x1, . . . , xn of this metric can be found from the linear system

ijxk = i

ijixk + j

jijxk,

i 6= j;

iixk =

n

xj=1

j
iijxk,

(8)

where k

ij are christoel symbols: i

ij = jhi/hi, j

ii = (2ij  1)(hijhi)/(h2

j ). we choose the

following initial conditions: xk(0) = 0, pk,l kl ixk(0)j xl(0) = ij. here kl is the xed symmetric

nondegenerate matrix.

the darboux  egoro system can be regarded as the compatibility conditions of the following

linear system:

ji(u, ) = ij(u)j(u, ),

i 6= j

ii(u, ) = i(u, ) xk6=i

ik(u)k(u, ),

(9)

(10)

here i = (1
there exists a unique solution of this linear system with the initial conditions k

i ), i = 1, . . . , n, are vector-functions which are formal power series in .
i (0, ) = ixk(0).

i , . . . , n

it follows from (9), (10) that the expansion of i has the form

i(u, ) =

system (9,10) implies that i = pn

j=1 ji and, therefore, pn

the last equality for s = 1 is, in fact, the denition of the constants rk.

s (u) = k

s1 for s  1.

3. let  be given by the formula

(u, ) =

n

xi=1

hi(u)i(u, ).

(14)

its straightforward to check that i(u, ) = hi(u)i(u, ). as a formal power series on  the k-th
component of the vector-function (u, ) has the form

k(u, ) = rk + xk(u) + yk(u)2 + zk(u)3 +



xs=4

k
s (u)s.

(15)

note that (13) implies that the functions k(x) = (x)/xk satisfy (5). moreover,

(x) =

n

xk=1

rkk(x)

and thus the function  can be regarded as a generating function for the at sections of the above-
dened connection k.

lemma 1. the vector-functions i(u, ) satisfy the equations

the scalar product given by the matrix kl: ha, bi = klakbl.

di(u, ), j (u, )e = ij2,

lemma 2. the scalar product

does not depend on .

(17)

both lemmas can be proved in the similar way. first we establish the required properties of the
scalar products (16), (17) at the point u = 0. then we show that they satisfy certain dierential
equations. the uniqueness theorem implies both statements.

corollary. the functions xk(u), yk(u) and zk(u) satisfy the following relation:

n

xq=1

kqyq =

n

xp,q=1

pq(cid:18)xq yp

xk  rq zp

xk(cid:19) .

(18)

proof. consider the scalar product d 1





xk (u, ), (u, )e. since /xk is the linear combina-

tion of /ui lemma 2 implies that this scalar product is independent of . on the other hand,
it can be presented as a power series in 

d 1





xk , e =

(19)

(here (u, ) = (u, )). therefore, all but the rst coecients of the series (19) should equal
zero. applying this argument to the coecient of 2 we obtain (18).

theorem. the function f (x) = f (u(x)) dened by the formula

f (u) =

1

n

xp,q=1

pq (xq(u)yp(u)  rqzp(u))

(20)

satises the equation (4).

proof. let us notice that corollary implies f/xk = pn

theorem is direct implication of (2) and (13) for s = 2.

q=1 kqyq. now the statement of the

from the previous formulas it follows that f satises the renormalization group type equation:

f (x)

in our next paper we hope to obtain more general formula, where the function f depends on
innitely many variables corresponding to gravitational descendants of the primary elds k.
