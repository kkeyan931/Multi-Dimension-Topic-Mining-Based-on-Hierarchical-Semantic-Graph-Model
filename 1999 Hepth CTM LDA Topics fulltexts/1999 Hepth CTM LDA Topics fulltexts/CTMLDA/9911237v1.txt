abstract

we consider the newtons force law for brane world consisting of periodic conguration

of branes. we show that it supports a massless graviton. furthermore, this massless mode

is well separated from the kaluza-klein spectrum by a mass gap. thus most of the

problems in phenomenology coming from continuum of kaluza-klein modes without mass

gap are potentially cured in such a model.

there has been a considerable interest in the model where the standard model is

conned to a (3+1) dimensional subspace in the higher dimensions[1][2][3]. this is a

renewal of old ideas[4][5] in light of recent developments of string theory, especially due to

the fundamental role that extended objects, i.e. branes, play a fundamental role. there

has been a lot of works related to this recently, such as generalization of the rs model[6][7],

in relation to supergravity or superstrings[8], in relation to cosmology[9], and also some

phenomenological consequences[10].

an alternative understanding of the hierachy problem of the electroweak and gravi-

tational mass scales is one of the major advantage of such a senario. in this senario, our

understanding of classical and quantum gravity has to be critically reanalyzed too: new-

tons law is aected by the kaluza-klein modes of the large extra dimensions, and gravity

may become strong at a scale of few tev in the full 4 + n dimensional space. furthermore,

the eect of virtual exchange of kaluza-klein towers of gravitons might be detected in

colliders in a forseeable future[11]. in the original formulation of randall and sundrum,

a continuous spectrum of kaluza-klein modes of graviton arises without any mass gap[3].

however, to have a well dened eective eld theory, it is desirable to have a solution where

the graviton is well separated by a mass gap from the kaluza-klein modes. in this paper

we consider a model with the desired spectrum of kaluza-klein with a mass gap without

direct reference to supergravity. this is when we have a periodic array of thin branes, in

light of recent proposals for a network such braneworlds[12], or a folded brane[13], produc-

ing many idential braneworlds[14]. such a picture raises an interesting question. what

will be the eect on our world from the presence of other worlds? some indirect eects

such as messengers of supersymmetry breaking[12][13], or cosmological/astrophysical ef-

fects were discussed[13]. here we will discuss one another aspect of such a network of

braneworld, which might be more sensitive to the shape of the network of the braneworlds.

it is the spectrum of kaluza-klein modes, which might perhaps be explorable at lc and

muon colliders[11]. as is quite familiar from condensed matter physics, which deals with

periodic systems (one or higher dimensional) in many cases, the energy levels of have a

distinct feature of the periodicity. this is the occurance of forbidden zones and allowed

bands in energy spectrum[15]. if we recall that the uctuation equations of modes around a

stable bps congurations satisfy (supersymmetric) quantum mechanics[16], and the spec-

trum of kaluza-klein spectrum comes from the energy spectrum of such a schrodinger

equation with the potential determined by the shape of the stable bps object, we expect

1

that a periodic conguration of such objects will lead to schrodinger equation with a pe-

riodic potential and the kaluza-klein spectrum will have mass gaps, reecting the band

structure. one might argue that there will be no distiction between this and the torus

compactication around a circle. however, since it is likely that the number of large extra

dimensions will be equal or larger than 2, there are possibilities of highly nontrivial net-

work of braneworlds, as we have witnessed from the many dierent ways that nanotubes

can form and aect the electronic structure[17].

here we will be mainly concerned with the kaluza-klein modes of the graviton. this

is because the original formulation of randall and sundrum necessarily has a continuum

of kaluza-klein modes without any mass gap, and the very low lying modes has been a

discomforting factor of the model. here we will explicitly calculate the mass gap arising

from a periodic system of 3 branes. there has been some works[18] having mass gaps

from a distribution of d-branes in the context of ve dimensional supergravity, however

the spectrum is dierent from what we consider here.

although we have conned our calculations to a simple one dimensional case this

method can be easily generalized to higher dimenensional cases as well as more com-

plicated networks, as well as other potentials for the uctuation equations from smooth

models[19][20]. for example, for the graphite like structure (or nanotube like structures)

we can utilize the hexagonal symmetry of the system and obtain the band structure, al-

though we might have to resort to numerical methods eventually. let us now consider the

solution ve dimensional metric that respects four dimensional poincare invariance[3], plus

the linearlized tensor uctuations h around it.

ds2 =(cid:16)e2k|y| + h (x, y)(cid:17) dxdx + dy2.

(1)

the spectrum h satises the schrodinger equation, with the appropriate change of
variables[3]: h(x, y) = (y)eipx, (z) = (y)ek|y|/2, h(x, z) = h(x, y)ek|y|/2, and z =
sgn(y)(ek|y|  1)/k. (we will be following closely the notations of ref.[3].) one of the
important feature of this model is that the bound state of the higher dimensional graviton

is localized in the extra dimension. that is to say, the graviton is conned to a small

region within this innite space. the argument supporting the existence goes as follows:

one considers the wave equation satised small gravitational uctuations, which takes the

form of a nonrelativistic schrodinger equation:

1
2

(cid:20)

 2

z + v (z)(cid:21) (z) = m2 (z).

2

(2)

for a simple conguration of single domain wall, one has the so called volcano-potential.

v (z) =

15k2

8(k|z| + 1)2 

3k
2

(z).

(3)

(we will be working in the units of h = 1, mass = m = 1.)

first of all there is a single normalizable bound state mode, which is the graviton of

the 3+1 dimensional world, supported by the delta function term in the potential:

0(z) = k1(k|z| + 1)3/2.

there is also a continuum kaluza-klein modes, with energy e = m2/2;

m(z)  nm(|z| + 1/k)1/2(cid:20)y2(m(|z| + 1/k)) +

4k2

m2 j2(m(|z| + 1/k))(cid:21) ,

(4)

(5)

where nm is the normalization constant. the gravitational force in our eective four

dimensional world is due to the exchange of the zero mode as well as continuum kaluza-

klein modes. these modes in the continuum without any gap potentially have some

problems phenomenologically. to cure this, let us now consider a brane world that is a

one dimensional periodic lattice of these worlds, separated apart by a lattice spacing of l.

then the potential for the gravitational uctuation will see a periodic potential:

v(z) =



xn=

v (z  nl).

(6)

as is familiar from the condensed matter physics, we expect that the energy spectrum now

develops a band structure with gaps between the bands. the typical width of the gap will

be related to the lattice spacing. one of the key question for us would be the location of

the rst band of allowed kaluza-klein modes, which will be aecting our four dimensional

eective theory most signicantly.

first of all, we assume that the domain walls are locally bps objects. then the

uctuation equations must be a supersymmetric quantum mechanics, so we are guaranteed

a massless mode which can be interepreted as the graviton. this is certainly the case for

the volcano potential. in fact we can easily check that the following is the solution with

zero mass:

0(z) 



xn=

k1(k|z  nl| + 1)3/2.

3

(7)

(we have to normalize the wave function piecewise for each period.) so around each

vocano potential, there will be a localized zero mode, and the shape of the zero mode will

be almost the same on each brane, when the branes are well separated.

now let us consider the kaluza-klein modes, whose spectrum will depend on the

detailed shape of the potential. one of the key feature of the kaluza-klein modes regardless

of the detailed shape will be that not all the energy eigenvalues will be allowed. we will

be considering the cases where the potentials are well separated, that is l > 1/k. we

will have many problems when the branes are overlapping with each other. in that case

the wave functions behave as sinusoidal functions for regions away form the center of the

volcano potential. this is possible because the bessel functions yn(z) and jn(z) behave
as sinusoidal functions for large values of z, when multiplied by z. to analyze the
spectrum, we rst consider a problem of a single potential. the wave function to the left
of the potential is (z)  aeimz + beimz for x << 1/k and the to the right it will
be (z)  ceimz + deimz for x >> 1/k. the relation between the coecients will be
through the transmission matrix m (m) as follows:

(cid:18) a
b(cid:19) = m (m)(cid:18) c

d(cid:19) =(cid:18) f (m) g(m)

g(m) f (m)(cid:19)(cid:18) c
d(cid:19) .

(8)

in the above we have used the condition for real potential v (z) for the general form of

the transmission matrix. we have additional condition that g(m) is pure imaginary if we
have even potential v (z) = v (z).

the evaluation of the components of the tranmission matrix can be done using wkb

approximation and we have the following solutions[21]:

f (m) = (m) +

1

4(m)

1

4(m)(cid:19) .

where

(m) = exp z b

a

(9)

(10)

, g(m) = i(cid:18)(m) 
dzp2(v (z)  e)! .
k(cid:17) and b = (cid:16)15

2m  1

in the above we have v > e = m2/2 for a < z < b. for the volcano potential, and for

m2/2 < 15k2/8, we have a = (cid:16)15

2m  1

not contribute, because we have v < e.) so for the volcano potential, we have

k(cid:17). (the delta function will

(m) = 15(log( +p2  1) p1  1/2).

4

(11)

where  =q 15
k
m > 1. the value of  is between zero and innity, and especially for the
value of m near zero, we have f (m)    . f (m) is real throughout the values of m.
this large value of f (m) for small m originates from the fact that v (z) is thick at the

4

base of the volcano.

now consider a potential which is obtained by juxtaposing n   of the single
potential we have considered above. then the condition for the allowed energy is that[22]

x = |re(eimlf (m))|  1.

(12)

for the case at hand, we have real values for f (m), so that the condition (12) is simply
| cos(ml)f (m)|  1. the function on the left hand side is oscillating with the enveloping
amplitude determined by f (m). since for all the values f (m)  1, we see that there
are necessarily fobidden zones, because certain ranges of values of m do not satisfy the
condition. especially, for the region of m near zero, f (m)  , so that for small enough
m the condition is not satised, becase cos(ml)  1. the rst kaluza-klein mode develops
where cos(ml)  0 for the smallest value of m, since there f (m) is very large. thus we
have m  
2l . we see that there is a forbidden zone right above the zero mode, and this is
a boon for the phenomenology for the following reasons. (if we did have a phase for f (m)

we might not enjoy the mass gap right above the graviton.)

i) since there will be a gap right above the zero mode, the lowest kaluza-klein mode

will start at say mk. for this case the physics of the eective four dimensional theory will
be mostly aected by the rst band and the newtons law of gravity will be as follows:

vn (r)  gn

m1m2

r (cid:18)1 + emkr(cid:18) mk

r

+

1

r2(cid:19)(cid:19) .

(13)

we have an exponential suppression of the correction to the newtons law. this will be

a generic feature of any of the models involving a network of brane worlds or manyfold

universe, as long as there are many of the brane worlds to have periodicity.

ii) there will be modications in the standard model cross sections due to the virtual

exchange of graviton towers. new processes not allowed in the standard model at the tree

level might appear. in the case of exchange, the amplitude is proportional to the sum over

the propagators of the entire kaluza-klein tower and can potentially diverge. usually it

is dealt with brute force regularization[11]. in the presence of a mass gap, it will behave

much better, since the lattice size of the network of braneworlds will give a natural cuto

scale.

5

we conclude this paper with some general remarks. first of all, we have considered

models with branes in the thin limit.

in principle we can model the branes from (su-

per)gravity theories, and have smooth potentials for the uctuations. in considering such

a model, we will necessarily encounter a class of susy quantum mechanics with periodic

superpotentials, w (x + a) = w (x). susy quantum mechanics with periodic potentials

dier from non-periodic ones that it is possible for both isospectral potentials to support

zero modes, whereas in the nonperiodic ones either one or neither of the pair has a zero

mode[23]. most general periodic potentals which can be analytically solved involve ja-
cobis elliptic functions sn2(z|k), which in various limits become poschl-teller potentials,
which arose in the context of kaluza-klein spectrum alreay, or periodic potential such

as scarf potential[24]. it would be desirable to have some supergravity model with lead

to such a quantum mechanics system. (some discussions in this context can be found in

refs.[19][25].)

secondly, in order to have the weak scale scale, we might have to resort to the senario of

lykken and randall[6]. in this senario, one has localized graviton zero mode on the planck
brane and one has another brane at distance y0 away from it such that eky0 = tev/mpl.
to incorporate this idea into our frame work, we will regard this set of two branes as our

basic unit and imagine a periodic array of them. in terms of gravity, the planck branes

will be dominating the scene, and most of our analysis will be qualitatively the same.

the changes in the volcano potential will be introduced, and we can do the similar wkb

approximation to this new system and calculate the transmission matrix. we will again

get a mass gap in the kaluza-klein spectrum of graviton. this is all possible as long as

the lattice size is larger than the typical size of the brane pair which will be 5 - 10 planck

lengths.

more challenging problem would be to consider the full two or higher dimensional

array of braneworlds and consider a condensed universe and kaluza-klein modes in

such a universe.

it might be possible to have a cosmology where we have a rather

chaotic initial condition and have become condensed to a network before the nucleo-

synthesis[12][13]. if there is enough symmetry, such as hexagonal symmetry, the corre-

sponding kaluza-klein spectrum can in principle be obtained and even an experiment

sensitive enough to explore the conguration of the brane networks might be possible.

furthermore, compactication along the large extra-dimension can aect the spectrum,

just like the dierent electronic structure of a nanotube has from a graphite on a plane[17].
