abstract

we construct sugra solutions of brane congurations of inter-
secting dp and ns branes. these solutions are semi-localized in the
sense that one of the intersecting branes is smeared along the world
volume of the other, while the second is localized. we examine the
gauge theory that lives on the localized brane, and the various de-
scriptions possible via t and s dualities, and m-theory.

1 introduction

the sugra description of intersecting p-branes was considered by many
authors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. in all these works intersecting branes were
smeared in their relative transverse directions. the sugra solution was
characterized by two harmonic functions of the overall transverse coordinates.
intersection rules have been derived in more than one way to ensure stability,
and some unbroken super-symmetry [7, 5]. the metric, dilaton, rr forms
and the ns-ns 2-form are given by a superposition rule [6]. we specialize to
the case where a dp-brane intersects an ns brane over p-1 dimensions.

where hp and h5 are the dp and ns brane harmonic functions for p  4,
x0..p1 and xp..5 are the coordinates shared by both branes and the coordinates
that belong to the ns brane but not to the dp-brane respectively. the rr
form ux is quantized, and corresponds to the number of dp-branes. we
generalize this construction and allow either hp or h5 to depend on relative
transverse coordinates as well. the function describing the localized brane
should obey a curved space laplace equation [6, 9, 24], which in the einstein
frame is

ghi = 0

(2)

note that the functions will not depend on coordinates in the directions
shared by both branes (i.e. 0..p-1). the resulting solution describes a semi
localized intersection of two branes. finding such a solution involves solving
the nonlinear dierential equation, (2). solutions of brane intersections in
m-theory also obey a similar superposition rule.

sugra solutions of various brane constructions are of interest due to the
ads/cft duality. intersecting brane congurations were found to be power-
ful tools in analyzing supersymmetric gauge dynamics in various dimensions
[14, 16].
in [18, 19] various brane solutions with 16 supersymmetries and
their eld theory duals where discussed. by nding sugra solutions for in-
tersecting brane congurations one can make statements about eld theories
with less supersymmetries. the near horizon behavior of such solutions may
give us a sugra dual of the corresponding eld theory. however, if the

1

solution is that of a smeared intersection then the eld theory data (gauge
couplings, energy scale) is not apparent.

in this paper we shall nd semi-localized solutions, that is solutions in
which one of the harmonic functions depends only on the overall transverse
coordinates and the other depends on relative transverse coordinates as well.
we shall comment on the eld theory duals that these solutions describe. the
general form of such solutions was also considered by [11, 12, 24]. some of the
solutions that will be presented here have also been obtained by dimensional
reduction from 11 to 10 dimensions in the presence of singularities [9, 10, 13].
while nishing this work two related papers by d. youm hep-th/9902208,
and a. fayyazuddin, d. smith hep-th/9902210, that contain overlapping
results appeared in the electronic archive.

2 semi-localized ns branes

we start with solutions of dp  ns intersections where the ns brane is
smeared along the 6 direction, and has its world volume along (12345). we
shall think of this conguration as the continuum limit of a periodic array
of ns branes along 6, making h5 independent of x6, see g.(1).
in order
that the total number of ns branes be nite, we shall compactify x6, and
probe this conguration only at distances larger than the compactication
radius. we denote by v the coordinates that belong to the ns but not to the
dp-brane, which is extended in (12..p-1,6).

other dp-brane congurations are similar.

2.1 ns  d4
we start with an intersection of an ns and d4. the harmonic function
describing n5 smeared ns branes satises 789h5 = 0. this is trivially
solved by 1 + q5/r, where r2 = x2
9 (we consider only the spherical
symmetric solution for reasons explained below). we shall work in the near
horizon limit h5 = q5/r. thus the curved space laplace equation for the
harmonic function describing the n4 d4-branes, h4 is

7 + x2

8 + x2

h45 + h 1

(3)
by dening u = 2q5r, the above equation becomes a sum of two radial
laplace operators in at space

5 789ih4(v, r) = 0

hv1v(vv) + u2u(u2u)ih4(v, u) = 0

eq.(4) can be further simplied by dening w2 = v2 + u2.

hw5w(w5w) + w2()ih4(w, ) = 0

(4)

(5)

where tan  = u/v, and () is the angular part of the laplace operator. a
solution with no  dependence is h4 = 1 + q4/w4 which in the near horizon
limit, q4  w4, gives according to eq.(1) the following sugra solution

where r is the curvature of the ads part of the metric. the eld the-
ory described by this conguration should be an n = 2, four dimensional
n5
i=1su(n4) supersymmetric gauge theory with n5 hyper-multiplets in the
bi-fundamental representation, (ni, ni+1), where i = n5 + 1 is identied
with i = 1, since x6 is compact. there is also an extra u(1) factor, since
this conguration is an elliptic model [15]. this eld theory is conformal
(nf = 2nc for each of the gauge groups in the product), as is obvious from
the sugra solution, which contains an ads part. we consider solutions

isometry, which according to the ads/cft duality should be identied with
the r-symmetry of the gauge theory.

we now want to write the sugra solution in terms of eld theory vari-

ables, namely the energy scale and gy m .

q4  g2

y m n42

q5  n51/2

e2 = g2

s  g4

y m

(7)

since the eld theory is 3+1 dimensional, gy m is dimensionless. in order for
the metric to have an  factor in front, one should substitute x2
6 = 2. we
also note that there seem to be two energy scales in the solution, r = r/
and v = v/. however, because v and r do not enter symmetrically in the
denition of w, we cannot at the same time keep r and v xed when taking
  0. we will work only with the combination of the two, w = w/ and
sin . note, however, that w = v2 + 4q5r does not have the interpretation
of the length of a stretched open string.

the 10 dimensional geometric description is only valid when the eective
string coupling e, and the curvature of the ads part in string units are
small. thus as in [19], we can deduce the energies at which we can use this
dual description. in this case the dilaton and curvature are only functions of
sin , which means that the geometric description is valid for: e  1 and
r  1.

when sin   0 we have two options. one is to elevate this solution to
m-theory. we get a conguration of two m5 branes, one of which is smeared
over the (6,10) directions, and localized in 789, and the other localized in
all its transverse directions (45,789). this solution is described by the same
harmonic functions as before, since the harmonic superposition rule (m5 
m5) in 11 dimensions gives the same laplace equation as the 10 dimensional
one.

(9)

this description does not give anything new, since the curvature still diverges
when sin   0.

we can also go to the t-dual conguration. by making a t duality in the
6 direction we get n4 d3 branes smeared in the 6 direction and localized on
a singular compact space, x. the new metric and dilaton are derived from
the original ones using t-duality rules [17].

x turns out to be a zn5 orbifold of s5, where the orbifold acts on
where ds2
the s3 (6789) part of eq.(6). the connection between the ns brane and
an 1 singularities, which are described by this metric, and the eld content
of this theory were discussed in [20, 21, 22, 23].
in the t-dual picture it
is possible to generalize the solution to a near extremal brane in the usual
way by g00  g00f (w) and gww  gwwf 1(w). one can now t-dualize back
to the original conguration and obtain the solution for the near extremal
brane intersection. this conguration is not expected to be stable. one
should note that the radial coordinate w does not have the interpretation of
distance from the d3 in transverse space as in maldacenas original solution
[18], since w2 = v2 + 4q5r.

2.2 ns  d3
the next conguration we shall consider is an intersection of n3 localized
d3 branes with n5 ns branes smeared over the 6 direction. the sugra
solution can be derived in much the same way as in the previous case. we
know the near horizon behavior of h5 = q5/r and thus the equation for h3
is

h345 + h 1

5 789ih3(v, r) = 0

(11)
again we substitute u = 2q5r, look for solutions that depend only on
u, v in order to keep the so(3)r  so(3)v isometry that will correspond
to an r-symmetry, and write eq.(11) as a 7 dimensional at space laplace
operator.

hw6w(w6w) + w2()ih3(w, ) = 0

(12)

the solution that has no  dependence is h3 = 1 + q3/w5/2 and we shall
work in the near horizon limit. the sugra solution follows, as before, from

where r is the curvature of the (012w) part of the metric. note that, unlike
the ns  d4 solution, this metric does not describe a product space with an
ads part, thus the corresponding eld theory will not be conformal.
the eld theory described by this conguration should be a n5
i=1su(n3)
gauge theory in d=2+1 dimensions with 8 super-symmetries and n5 hyper-
multiplets in the (ni, ni+1) representations. as in the previous case, there
is an extra u(1) factor. the eld theory description is valid where g2

the geometric dual is valid when the eective string coupling, as well
as, the curvature in string units, are small. to see that we rst write the

when the string coupling becomes large we can go to the s-dual description.
the resulting sugra solution is just h 1/2

dilaton is just .

where now ds2
x is a zn5 orbifold of s6. as in the d4 case, the zn5 orbifold acts
only on the s3 (6789) part of the transverse space. this solutions resembles
the solution found in [19] for d2 branes in at space, where the original d6
is now orbifolded, and w is not the naive distance from the d2 brane. again
we can generalize to a near extremal solution and t-dualize back to get the
near extremal solution of the intersection.

2.3 ns  d2
the next conguration we shall discuss is the intersection of n2 localized d2
branes with n5 ns branes. h5 is the same as in the two previous cases, thus
the equation for h2 is

hw7w(w7w) + w2()ih2(w, ) = 0

(18)

the solution with no  dependence is h2 = 1 + q2/w6, thus getting the
following sugra solution

where now r is the curvature on the (01w) part of the metric. the eld
theory is a 1+1 dimensional n5
i=1su(n2) gauge theory, with an extra u(1),
and with n5 hyper-multiplets, and 8 supersymmetries. it can be described

by perturbation theory when w  gy mn2. we can express q2, q5 in

terms of eld theory variables as

the t-dual solution resembles the solution found for a d1 brane in at space
[19], with the original d7 orbifolded.

2.4 ns  d1
the last conguration that we describe in this section has no apparent eld
theory dual. a d1-brane along the 6 direction intersecting a smeared ns
brane is described by the function h1(v, r) that obeys
5 789ih1(v, r) = 0

h12345 + h 1

(24)

using similar techniques as in the previous cases, we change variables to w, 
and get the following equation

hw8w(w8w) + w2()ih1(w, ) = 0
a solution with no  dependence gives the following metric

to get a d0 smeared in the 1 direction and localized on an orbifold singularity.
in [19] it was speculated that the solution of n d0 is dual to super-symmetric
quantum mechanics.

3 semi-localized dp branes

we now turn to congurations in which the dp brane is smeared in the
world volume of the ns brane. we shall nd an explicit solution for d1 
ns. solutions for dp-branes up to p=4 will follow by t duality.
in the following construction the ns brane spans (12345), and is com-
pletely localized in (6789). the d1 (6) is localized in (789), but is smeared
in (12345). thus the harmonic function of the d1 brane does not depend
on x12345 and should obey 789h1 = 0. this gives h1 = 1 + q1/r. in the
near horizon limit we neglect the 1 in h1. thus h5 satises a curved space
laplace equation

by dening u = 2q1r we get

h2

eq.(28) can be written using w2 = x2

6 + u2 and tan  = u/x6.

hw4w(w4w) + w2()ih5(w, ) = 0

we shall concentrate on solutions that have no  dependence, h5 = 1 +
q5/w3. this solution can be generalized to

h5 = 1 +

((x  xi)2 + 4q1r)3/2

(31)

it can be seen that the procedure will be the same for all other dp branes
up to p=4. this is equivalent to t-dualizing along (12345). the eect of
this duality is just gii  1/gii. the case of an ns localized within a d6
brane was considered from another point of view in [9, 13]. it is also related
by t-duality to the solutions shown here. since in these solution the ns-
brane is localized, we expect the corresponding eld theory to live on the
ns-brane. this eld theory will have a rr background from the dp-branes,
and 8 supersymmetries. we shall not explore such eld theories here.

4 summary and discussion

we have displayed solutions of semi-localized intersecting ns and dp-branes.
given the metrics of these intersections, one can learn about the eld the-
ory duals to these congurations by calculating wilson loops. for example,
when calculating the wilson loop in the ns  d4 case, the metric factors
into ads5  x 5. thus, provided that we do not move on x 5, i.e. change,
the result will be independent of the nature of x 5. the same is also true
for the rest of the congurations, that the wilson loop of the eld theory is
determined by the part in the metric corresponding to the brane world vol-
ume coordinates, while the number of supersymmetries and matter content
are determined by the nature of x. the solutions for dp-branes intersecting
ns branes were shown to be dual to d(p-1)-branes on singular backgrounds.
similar solutions for dp-branes intersecting dp-branes can be found using
it is, however, not clear what eld theories a

the techniques shown here.
