abstract

the spin of a glueball is usually taken as coming from the spin (and possibly

the orbital angular momentum) of its constituent gluons. in light of the di-

culties in accounting for the spin of the proton from its constituent quarks, the

spin of glueballs is reexamined. the starting point is the fundamental qcd

eld angular momentum operator written in terms of the chromoelectric and

chromomagnetic elds. first, we look at the possible restrictions placed on

the structure of glueballs from the requirement that the qcd eld angular

momentum operator should satisfy the standard commutation relationships.

this analysis can be compared to the electromagnetic charge/monopole sys-

tem, where the requirement that the total eld angular momentum obey the

angular momentum commutation relationships places restrictions (i.e.

the

dirac condition) on the system. second, we look at the expectation value of

the eld angular momentum operator under some simplifying assumptions.

i. introduction

one of the results of the emc experiment [1] was to show that the spin of the proton
did not come solely from the spin of the valence quarks as naive quark models indicated.
after the emc experiment other possible contributing sources to the protons spin were
considered, such as angular momentum from sea quarks, angular momentum from the orbital
motion of valence quarks, and angular momentum from the chromodynamic eld.

in light of this surprise 1 in the make up of the spin of the proton, we want to take a
closer look at the spin of pure glue bound states. in the case of glueballs there is currently no
rm experimental evidence for their existence. ref. [3] gives the status of various candidates.
thus, presently there is no need to explain anything in regards to the spin of the glueballs,
since there is no clear cut discrepancy between experiment and the theoretical models.
however, since the simple quark models did not work in accounting for the spin structure of
the proton, it is reasonable to ask if a similar problem may exist for the simple theoretical
models of the glueballs spin. while most glueball studies focus on the mass spectrum of
glueballs, here we want to examine the glueballs spin, starting from the fundamental gluonic
eld angular momentum operator given below in eq. (1).

the gauge-invariant qcd eld angular momentum operator [4] which is responsible for

the glueballs spin is

jgb = z d3x [x  (ea  ba)]

(1)

where ea, ba are the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic elds, and a is an su(3) color
index. except for the color indices this form of the pure gauge eld angular momentum is
similar to the abelian case [5], and like the abelian form contains both spin and orbital
contributions. it is not possible to split eq. (1) into a separate spin and orbital part in a
gauge-invariant way [6] [7]. eq. (1) is the total angular momentum of the glueball, and so
it should satisfy the angular momentum commutation relationship

[j i

gb, j j

gb] = iijkj k

gb

(2)

the main point of this paper is that the requirement of eq. (2) will place some restrictions
on the form of the chromodynamic elds, ea, ba, and on the structure of glueballs.

before proceeding with the details of the calculation of [j i

gb] we should ask if it is
physically reasonable that eq. (2) should place restrictions on the color elds. for the elec-
tromagnetic interaction there are also systems which carry eld angular momentum, such as
the charge/monopole conguration. for this example the angular momentum commutators
do place a restriction on the system [8] : the magnetic charge is restricted to take on dirac
values (i.e. eg = n/2 with n an integer). based on this electromagnetic example one might
similarly expect that eq.
(2) would place restrictions on qcd systems. one dierence
between qcd and qed is that for qed systems with eld angular momentum (e.g. the

gb, j j

1in ref. [2] there was already an early hint that the spin of the proton might not be as simple as
quark models indicated

2

charge/monopole system or the charge/magnetic dipole system [9]) one generally knows to a
very good approximation the form of the elds. thus the functional form of the eld angular
momentum can be determined analytically, and the commutation rules can be worked out
explicitly. if on the other hand the functional form of the electromagnetic elds were not
known to such a good approximation (as is the case with the color elds of qcd) then the
angular momentum algebra might lead to broader restrictions (i.e. ruling out a large class of
possible electromagnetic eld congurations). it would be a greater surprise if any arbitrary
form for the color elds satised the angular momentum algebra. there is a subtle point
in the electromagnetic systems with eld angular momentum which needs mentioning : the
eld angular momentum by itself does not satisfy the commutation relationships. only the
combination of eld plus particle angular momentum satises eq. (2). here we will nd that
a similar restriction might apply to jgb  that the pure glueball eld angular momentum
must combine with some other angular momentum in order to satisfy eq. (2).

ii. standard picture of glueball spin

there are several methods for investigating glueballs. the most rigorous method is via
the numerical calculations of lattice gauge theories. the properties of the glueballs which are
most commonly investigated in this way are their masses, string tension, and deconnement
temperature. in either lattice calculations or in phenomenological models, the spin of the
glueball is determined based on some simplifying assumptions. for example, glueballs can be
f 
associated with gauge invariant qcd eld strength operators [10] such as f a
a ,
which are spin 0, or f a
in this last case there is some
ambiguity as to whether these operators should be associated with one glueball of spin 2, or
two spin 0 glueballs in a d-wave state. usually one chooses the former case for simplicity.
however, we will argue that the angular momentum algebra may restrict glueballs to always
be spin 0, in which case the latter choice would be required. there is also some uncertainty
in the spin assignment of glueballs in lattice studies as pointed out in a recent lattice glueball
review [11]. essentially for a given irreducible representation of the lattice rotational group
there are states with dierent values of total angular momentum which reduce to the same
continuum state. usually one makes the simplest choice and associates a given continuum
state with the lattice state with the minimum value of total angular momentum.

one can also investigate glueballs using various phenomenological models [12], such as
bag models [13] or using massive constituent gluons [14]. both of these approaches roughly
picture the glueballs as composed of two or three valence gluons. the glueball then has a
total spin which is taken as coming from the sum of the orbital and spin angular momentum

of these valence gluons (i.e. jgb = p(li + si) ). this kind of picture is similar in spirit to

the quark models which had the spin of the proton coming only from the valence quarks.
since the simple quark models had diculties giving the correct proton spin structure, a
similar problem may occur with the glueball spin structure in these simple models.

iii. gluonic field angular momentum

eq. (1) can be recast in index notation as j i

gb = 1

2ijkj jk where

3

j jk = z d3xm 0jk(~x)

m 0jk are some of the components of the rank 3 tensor m 

m  = t x  t x  m 0jk = t 0kxj  t 0jxk

(3)

(4)

t 0k, t 0j are the time-space components of the energy-momentum tensor t  of the yang-
mills gauge elds

t  =

gf af a

  f  af  a

  t 0k = f 0i af k a

(5)

the yang-mills elds tensor components, f 0i a, f ki a, are the color electric and color magnetic
elds respectively. in terms of the gauge elds these are

0i = 0aa

ij = iaa

using this string of denitions we can write down the gluon eld angular momentum of eq.
(1) in index form as

j i

gb = ilmz d3x(cid:16)f 0n af m a

n (cid:17) xl

(7)

iv. angular momentum commutation relationships

in this section we will use the expression in eq. (7) to calculate the commutator for the

pure glueball angular momentum. we will not write out the integrals r d3xr d3y.... since

these can always be applied after taking the commutator of the integrand in eq. (7). from
eq. (7) we have

[j i

gb(x), j j

gb(y)] = ilmjpqxlxp[(f 0n a(x)f m a
= ilmjpqxlxp(f 0n af 0r b[f m a
+ f 0r b[f 0n a, f q b

r ]f m a

n + [f 0n a, f 0r b]f m a

r ] + f 0n a[f m a
n , f 0r b]f q b
n f q b
r )

r

n (x)), (f 0r b(y)f q b
n , f q b

r (y))]

(8)

in the last line the x, y dependences are not written out explicitly. the  s and xi s have
been pulled outside the commutator brackets since they commute with one another and
with f a
. standard commutator algebra has been used to write things in terms of two-term
commutators. none of the commutators above have any non-trivial contribution coming
from the su(3) group structure of the elds, since the f a
  s are all simply su(3) compo-
nents. another way to see this is to write f a
 in terms of the matrix eld strength tensor,
2 ab
f  f a
 = 2t r[ft a]. since the group factors are
where t r = trace) f a
traced over in this expression for f a
 they only give trivial commutators in eq. (8). any pos-
sible non-trivial commutation structure in eq. (8) arises, as in ref. [15], from representing
the gauge potentials in terms of creation/annihilation operators.

t a. using the standard normalization for the group generators (t r[t at b] = 1

 can be written as f a

4

in the canonical formalism, where the gauge elds are given by creation/annihilation

operators, the su(3) gauge elds satisfy the following commutation relationships [16]

[aa
[ea

i (x, t), eb
i (x, t), eb

j (y, t)] = iijab3(x  y)
j (y, t)] = [aa

(x, t), ab

(y, t)] = 0

(9)

0ad

0 + gf bcdac

expanding the chromoelectric eld in the above commutators as eb
j 
jab
j , and using the last commutator in eq. (9) one nds that only the time
derivative term in the chromoelectric eld expansion gives a nontrivial commutator since
[aa
j (y, t)] = 0 by
the last commutator in eq. (9). in the rst example the superscript (y) indicates that the
derivative is taken with respect to y. thus the commutation relationships involving the
chromoelectric eld can be rewritten as

0(y, t)] = 0 and [aa

0(y, t)] = (y)

i (x, t), (y)

0j = 0ab

i (x, t), ac

i (x, t), ab

j(y, t)] = iijab3(x  y)

j(y, t)] = 0

(10)

except for the group index kronecker delta these are identical to the eld commutators in
an abelian theory [17].

n , f q b
n, gf bef aeqaf

when the commutator, [f m a
r ], in eq . (8) is expanded in terms of the potentials
n, gf bef aeqaf
one nds commutators like [maa
r ].
n, af
by commutator algebra these can all be reduced to sums of commutators like [ac
r ]
or [maa
n, aeq] (i.e. commutators of the
gauge potential with itself or with its spatial derivatives). all the these vanish by the last
commutation relationship in eq. (9) thus in eq. (8) [f m a

n, aeq] = m[aa

r] = mq[aa

r] or [maa

r ] or [maa

the remaining three terms from eq. (8) involve commutators between f 0i a and itself
or between , f 0i a and f jk b. these three commutators can be evaluated by expanding f 0i a
and f jk b in terms of the gauge potentials. it is easy to see that the only non-trivial part
of these three commutators comes from the commutation of the time derivative term in
f 0i a (i.e. 0ai a) with the gauge potential (ak b) or its spatial derivative (jak b). since
glueballs are bound states one has the extra physical constraint that the gauge potentials
are time independent 0ai a = 0 (at least in the glueball rest frame). taking this physical
constraint into account the chromoelectric part of the eld strength tensor for pure glueballs
simplies to f 0i a = iaa
i . (strictly one can not set the operator, 0ai a, equal
to zero, but this condition should be applied to the glueball states, |gi, as is done in the
following section. this gupta-bleuler-like procedure could easily be applied here and would
not change the nal result in eq. (11) below). from eqs. (9) and (10) one can see that
each of these terms commutes with other gauge potential components, aa
, or with spatial
derivatives of gauge potential components. thus the commutators for the glueball angular
momentum operator yields

0 + gf abcab

0ac

[j i

gb, j j

gb] = 0

(11)

the vanishing of this commutator comes directly from the physical requirement that for
bound states the gauge eld should be time-independent (0ai a = 0).

the result given in eq. (11) may seem strange, but an analogous result arises in the
electromagnetic system of a charge and monopole at rest with respect to one another. for

5

this system one can calculate the eld angular momentum as jem = egr/r, where e, g, r are
the electric charge, magnetic charge and displacement between the two charges respectively.
the commutator of the components of jem with itself gives zero since r/r commutes with
itself. alternatively, one could proceed in the electromagnetic case as in the color eld case
by writing jem out as in eq. (1) in terms of the normal electric and magnetic elds. the
commutator of the components of jem among themselves could then be calculated using the
electromagnetic version of the gauge potential commutators given by eqs. (9) (10) with the
color indices dropped. the only non-trivial terms would come from commutators between
0ai and aj or jak. however, in the frame where the electric and magnetic charges are
at rest, the gauge elds are time-independent so that 0ai = 0, and one again nds that
the commutator for the electromagnetic eld angular momentum is zero. in the color eld
case this latter method is the only viable one, since for the color interaction an explicit form
for ea and ba is not known so that an explicit calculation of jqcd is not possible. for the
electromagnetic system e and b are coulomb elds, and so jem can be calculated directly.

there are several ways of looking at this apparent conict between eqs. (2) and (11).

 first, eqs. (2) and (11) are consistent if glueballs are restricted to be spin 0 (jgb = 0)
bound states. this is not an unreasonable restriction since the identication of the
spin of a non-zero spin glueball is usually based on some simplifying assumptions.
as mentioned previously spin 2 glueballs are usually connected with qcd operators
like f a
a . however, one could instead associate these objects with two
spin 0 glueballs in a d-wave orbital angular momentum state. the former choice is a
reasonable, simplifying assumption, but may not be correct in light of the restriction
coming from [j i

a or f a


f 

f 

gb, j j

gb] = 0.

 a second explanation of the zero commutator is that glueballs do not occur as pure
glue bound states, but always have some admixture of quarks. if the glueball states
are mixed with qq states, these would contribute to the overall spin of the bound state.
to take into account the contribution coming from the quarks, one would add the total
quark angular momentum operator [4]

~jq = z d3x(cid:20) 1

2

~5 + (~x  (i ~d))(cid:21)

(12)

to the pure qcd term of eq. (1) so that ~jgb  ~jgb + ~jq. (the two terms in eq. (12)
are associated with the spin and orbital angular momentum of the quarks respectively).
this total angular momentum might then satisfy eq. (2) with the proper non-zero
term on the right hand side. such mixing of quarks with glueballs is thought to be
suppressed via the 1/nc expansion approach [10]. however, the restriction coming from
the angular momentum commutators as discussed above, might be an indication that
pure glue states can not exist  that there will always be some substantial admixture of
quarks in order to have the correct angular momentum commutators. this postulated
mixing might explain the diculty in experimentally distinguishing an object as a
pure glueball. this explanation for eq. (11) is also reminiscent of the electromagnetic
charge/monopole system, where it is only the sum of the eld angular momentum plus
the other contributions which satises eq. (2).

6

 finally, recent work [18] [19] has shown that the choice of the lorentz frame in which
the angular momentum of a system is evaluated can have an impact on the interpreta-
tion of the angular momentum. thus, the peculiar result of eq. (11) may be connected
with the choice of lorentz frame in which the glueball angular momentum is evaluated
(up to this point we have implicitly assumed that j i
gb is evaluated in the rest frame of
the glueball). in ref. [18] an investigation of the ( 1
2, 1
2 ) representation of the lorentz
group, showed that it is not possible, in a general lorentz frame, to split the ( 1
2 , 1
2)
space into spin 1 and spin 0 sectors. two special cases were found in which the spin
1 / spin 0 decomposition was possible : (a) in the rest frame (b) in the helicity frame
where the quantization axis for spin projections is aligned with the boost direction. in
ref. [19] a related result was found in a somewhat dierent context. ref. [19] examined
the break up of the total nucleon spin into terms for the quark spin and orbital angular
momentum, and gluon spin and orbital angular momentum. under a general lorentz
transformation it was found that these individual terms did not transform properly,
thus making their interpretation frame dependent. ref. [19] also found that the two
special frames listed above (i.e. the rest frame and the helicity frame) were picked out
as being particularly useful in studying the spin structure of the nucleon. although
the central concerns of each of these works dier from each other, they both point out
the importance that choice of the lorentz frame makes in the study of the angular
momentum. this may imply that the diculty in formulating a clear picture of the
spin structure of the glueball may rest in our implicit choice of the rest frame.

there are certain phenomenological bag models of glueballs [20] where the assumption
that the color elds are time independent is not true. in these models, to lowest order, the
chromoelectric and chromomagnetic elds are analogous to the ordinary electric and mag-
netic elds inside a resonant cavity so that the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic elds,
and the gauge potentials have oscillatory time-dependences. however the chromoelectric
and chromomagnetic elds in these models are 90o out of phase with one another. therefore
at some particular time the chromoelectric eld will be at a maximum while the chromomag-
netic eld is zero, and at some later time the chromomagnetic eld will be at a maximum
while the chromoelectric eld vanishes. at these times, when either ea or ba = 0, jgb = 0
from eq. (1). since jgb is conserved (i.e. is time independent) this implies that jgb = 0
at any time. this vanishing of jgb was one of the possible resolutions that we arrived
at by applying the angular momentum commutators to jgb and assuming that the elds
were time independent. thus, even in the phenomenological bag models where the time
independence assumption does not hold, we still nd the restriction jgb = 0. one can also
present a more general argument to support the time independence of the elds. since jgb
is conserved  djgb/dt = 0. from eq. (1) this implies that

z d3x"x   dea

dt

 ba + ea 

dba

dt !# = 0

(13)

(x is not dierentiated since it is the time independent position vector from the origin to
some particular part of the momentum density, ea  ba). there are two simple ways in
which eq. (13) can be satised. first, if dea/dt = dba/dt = 0. this implies that the elds
are time independent which was the assumption in our analysis. second, if ea = ba then

7

eq. (13) is satised. however, in this case, even though the elds do not need to be time
independent, one nds that jgb = 0 from eq. (1). there is apparently no simple way to
have both jgb 6= 0 and dea/dt 6= 0, dba/dt 6= 0.

v. expectation of jgb

in this section we calculate the expectation value of j i

gb with respect to a glueball state,
|gi, under certain simplifying assumptions. from eq. (7) the expectation value is given by

hg|j i

gb|gi = ilmz d3xhg|(cid:16)f 0n a(x)f m a

n (x)(cid:17) |gixl

(14)

0

0 = 0.

in terms of the operator aa

0 can be split into positive and negative frequency parts : aa

the glueball state is taken to be normalized so that hg|gi = 1. since the eld angular
momentum operator in eq. (7) is gauge invariant we are free to choose a gauge without
eecting the physically measurable quantities like the spin of the glueball. we choose the
temporal gauge where aa
0 we implement this gauge
choice using a gupta-bleuler-like approach by making it a condition on the glueball state 
hg|aa
0|gi = 0. aa
0 +
aa()
. the positive frequency part can be written as a sum of annihilation operators, while
the negative frequency part can be written as a sum of creation operators. thus the gauge
condition hg|aa
0 = 0. next, since the glueball is
a bound state, we have the physical (as opposed to gauge) restriction that 0aa
i = 0 which
we will also implement as a condition on the glueball state  hg|0aa
i |gi = 0. this can
also be written in terms of the positive and negative frequency parts as 0aa(+)
|gi = 0 and
hg|0aa()
= 0. expanding f 0n a in term of the gauge potentials we can write out a portion
of the right hand side of eq. (14) as

0|gi = 0 becomes aa(+)

|gi = 0 and hg|aa()

0 = aa(+)

by using the commutation rules for the non-abelian gauge potentials given by eq. (10)
we will move the various terms coming from f 0n a through f m a
and then apply either the
n
gauge condition aa(+)
|gi = 0. in order to apply the
commutators of eq. (10) we have changed f 0n a(x) to f 0n a(y). in the end we will let y  x.
in eq. (15) f 0n a, expanded in terms of the aas, has both positive and negative frequency
parts, but the negative frequency parts will vanish directly when hg| is applied to the left
side of eq. (15). thus as we pull f 0n a through f m a
n we are only dealing with the positive
frequency parts even though the superscript (+) will not be written out explicitly. the last
term in f 0n a (gf abca0b(y)anc(y)) can be trivially commuted past f m a
(x) since both a0b(y)
and anc(y) commute with other gauge elds components or their spatial derivatives by the
last commutator in eq. (9). after this term is commuted through f m a

(x) one has

metry of f ade, and the kronecker delta in the group indices in the commutator of eq. (9)
(i.e. [0ana(y), ae

(22)

the rst term above is zero because of the  function. the integral in the second term
evaluates to the kronecker delta, ml. thus the expectation of j i

gb becomes

hg|j i

gb|gi = iilmml = iill = 0

(23)

using the properties of the s. thus by imposing the temporal gauge condition (aa(+)
; hg|aa()
time independent (0aia(+)|gi = 0 ; hg|0aia() = 0) it is found that hg|j i

|gi = 0
0 = 0) and the physical condition that for a bound state the gauge elds should be

0

gb|gi = 0.

vi. conclusions

by examining the commutation relationships ([j i

gb]) and the expectation value
(hg|j i
gb|gi) of the glueball angular momentum operator it was found that both of these
quantities were zero. the main assumption in both of these results was that the gauge elds

gb, j j

9

em , j j

em ] = 0 where j i

were time-independent (0aia = 0), since the glueball is a bound state. the non-abelian
nature of the gauge elds played little role in the commutation relationships of j i
gb, since the
group indices are traced over in the expression of j i
gb. thus one would expect that a similar
result ([j i
em is the electromagnetic eld angular momentum) should
hold for abelian gauge elds (a) under similar conditions (0ai = 0). for the two abelian
examples where this has been worked out explicitly (the monopole/charge system and the
magnetic dipole/charge system [9]) it is in fact found that the eld angular momentum, by
itself, does not satisfy the angular momentum commutation relationships. in light of these
abelian examples, and the similarity between j i
em the results for the glueball
angular momentum operator are not so surprising.

gb and j i

we have suggested several possible resolutions/explanations for these results for j i

gb.

 first, the fact that both [j i
glueballs can only be spin 0.

gb, j j

gb] and hg|j i

gb|gi are zero may imply that pure

 second, the above results may indicate that glueballs will always have some signicant

admixture of quarks, which will contribute to the spin structure of the glueball.

 finally, one needs to consider the eect that the choice of lorentz frame makes in the

study and interpretation of the angular momentum of the glueball system.
