abstract

d0 brane (d-particle) action possesses rst and second class constraints that result
in local  symmetry. the  symmetry of the d-particle is extended here into a larger
symmetry ( and +) in a larger phase space by turning second class constraints into
rst class. dierent gauge xings of these symmetries result in dierent presentations
of the d-particle while a unitary gauge xing of the new + symmetry retrieves the
original d-particle action with  =  symmetry.

introduction

an important ingredient in the study of d-branes[1] dynamics is their local fermionic

symmetry on the world-volume, the  symmetry. the history of this symmetry goes

back to the superparticle action[2] where it was rst identied in [3] and applied to the

superstring[4]. it was used also in the study of super p-branes[5] in dierent dimensions.

the role of the  symmetry was further emphasized in the study of the d-branes embedded

in at 10d space-time in [6][7]. the symmetry is generated by 16 irreducible rst class

fermionic constraints. these constraints are accompanied by another set of 16 second

class fermionic constraints which do not correspond to any local symmetry. the covariant

separation of the two types of constraints in the brane action was emphasized in [8][9],

enabled the covariant quantization of the d0 and d1 brane.

it has been found dicult to quantize covariantly the massless superparticle, as is

the situation also with the green-schwarz formulation of the superstring [4] since in both

systems rst and second class constraints cannot be separated in a covariant manner. this

is a long lasting problem and many attempts have been made to solve it [10]-[11]. in the

massive superparticle action the  symmetry is explicitly broken. its rst class constraints

are replaced now by solvable second class constraints and the system can be quantized

covariantly by means of dirac brackets since all its constraints are second class. since

the massive superparticle can be quantized covariantly, one may be tempted to consider

the massless limit of the massive case as a substitute for the covariant quantization of
the massless superparticle. however, the dirac brackets become singular in the p2 =
m2  0 limit. the restoration of the broken  symmetry of the massive system in an
extended phase space[12] by adding extra fermionic degrees of freedom was considered

in[13]. another possibility to restore the  symmetry is to include a proper wess-zumino

term in the action, as is the case with the d0 brane [6]-[9]. this is physically more

interesting, but contains in addition to the rst class constraints, that correspond to

the restored  symmetry, also second class constraints . when considering the massless

limit, one nds the need to avoid these second class constraints since also here the dirac

brackets become singular in the massless limit. the restoration of symmetry with no

second class constraints, gives the full advantages of working within a system with local

1

symmetry in particular a covariant wave function can be formulated also in the massless

limit[13]. for this purpose, it is usually useful to turn the second class constraints into

rst class. this formulation oers a exibility to allow various gauge xings which are

physically equivalent. at the same time, the newly introduced rst class constraints

generate a gauge symmetry which may give more insight into the geometrical structure

of the system which is interesting in its own right.

in this paper we suggest a new symmetric system for the d-particle in which the second

class constraints are turned into rst class in an extended phase space which includes extra

fermionic degrees of freedom.

we dene a system that contains , , the original fermionic degrees of freedom of

the d0 brane to which extra fermionic degrees of freedom ,  are added ( ,  are

majorana-weyl spinors while ,  are only majorana). the new system has, in addition

to the original  =  symmetry a new local + symmetry. the system can be gauge

xed in many dierent ways while one of these gauge xings (unitary gauge) retrieves

the original d0 brane.

the system has 8 fermionic rst class constraints and 8 fermionic second class con-
straints and thus its phase space has (32  2  8  8) 8 independent fermionic degrees
of freedom.

local  symmetry is explicitly broken in the n=1 massive superparticle action in d=10

dimensions [13]:

here, using eq.(2), one nds l = 2iem2 + 6= 0. all 16 constraints are second class
and its phase space has (32  16 =)16 independent fermionic degrees of freedom.

one possible modication by which the local  symmetry can be restored is extending

its phase space to n=2 while adding an appropriate wess-zumino term.

has a restored  symmetry. the system has now not only 16 rst class constraints

but also 16 second class constraints and the number of independent degrees of freedom
in phase space is the same as the n=1 massive superparticle (64  2  16  16 = 16).
indeed, when compared to the massive n=1 superparticle action in eq.(3), the added

negative chirality  degrees of freedom ( 32 degrees of freedom in phase space;  and

their canonical conjugate +) can be gauged away once the restored  symmetry is
gauge xed ( = 0). one is left, after gauge xing, back with l( ) of the massive n=1
superparticle in eq.(3).

a very appealing point of view on l( ) of eq.(9) is obtained when one starts with the

n=2 massless superparticle action in d=11 dimensions which is given by ([2]-[4]):

s = z f

i l( )d = 

1

2 z f

i

d e1( x m  i m )2

(10)

where x m ( m = 0, 1...10) are the space-time coordinates and  = + +( = 1, 2...32)
are the corresponding fermionic coordinates which form two majorana weyl spinors of

opposite chiralities.

when one of the space directions is compactied [16] to a radius of r = m1 = z 1,

the d=11 massless superparticle action results [8][9] in the d0 brane action.

s = z f

i l( )d = z f

ez 2  iz 11  }

(11)

where p10 was set to p10 = m = z ,  10 is dened as 11 and ( = 0, 1...9).

the d0 brane action in eq.(11) is the same action obtained in eq.(9) and its wess-
zumino term z 11  establishes the local  symmetry, which is the original symmetry of
the d=11 massless superparticle action[8][9]. thus, instead of 32 second class constraints

as in the n=2, d=10 massive superparticle action, the d0 has 16 rst class constraints

and 16 second class constraints which is the same number of constraints as the massless

n=2, d=10 superparticle and here too the 16 rst class constraints result in  symmetry.

an important dierence between the d0 action and the massless superparticle is the fact

4

that in the d0 case the rst and second class constraints can be separated in a covariant

manner[8][9], this cannot be done for the massless n=2 d=10 superparticle.

we would like to treat now the d0 system in a more symmetrical manner by turning

also its remaining 16 second class constraints into rst class. the resulting system will

have in addition to the original  symmetry also a + symmetry generated by the new

rst class constraints. among all possible dierent gauge xing of the new + symmetry,

one should also be able to retrieve the original d0 system, by appropriately gauge xing

(unitary gauge xing) the extended symmetric system.

after implementing the + extended symmetry into the system, the number of inde-

pendent degrees of freedom should not change. thus, one has to extend the phase space

of the new, symmetric system by adding extra fermionic degrees of freedom to account

for the increase of symmetry. in the following we dene and summarize the properties of

the +,  symmetric system. from eq.(11)(ignoring the boundary term) or from:

s = zz f

where  is the momentum, canonical conjugate of  (right handed derivatives are used
when taking a derivative with respect to ).

and we have:

in the 32 32 matrix 0(6p + z11), each of its 16 16 blocks has a non-zero determinant,
and 0(6p + z11) has rank 16 . the rst and second class constraints can be covariantly
separated by dening [8][9]:

,

[ t2, t2] = 2i(0 1  11

the generator of  symmetry and reparametrization is given in terms of the parameters

(21)

as mentioned above, the d0 brane has a total of 16 independent fermionic degrees of
freedom in phase space ( 32  2  (2  16 + 16) ) as reected by the 16 rst class and 16
second class fermionic constraints in eq.(19).

in an extended phase space where the system is described by extra degrees of freedom,

second class constraints can be turned into rst class [12]. gauge xing of the new

symmetry eliminates these extra degrees of freedom and in a unitary gauge xing the

original d0 system is recovered. however, the system in the extended phase space which

now possess  and + fermionic symmetry accepts also other gauge xings as well.

one denotes the second class constraints poisson bracket by [12]:

(22)

v constructs the brst operator in the extended symmetric system and  is used

in order to dene[12] a linear combination of extra 32 fermionic degrees of freedom in

one denes now, in the extended phase space, the following constraints, which are rst

(28)

thus, the dynamics in the extended phase space are dened by the two opposite

+ = zi+ ,

(34)

the action in eq.(33) is invariant under these transformations if supplemented also by:

+ = + ,

p = 4i(+  + + 6p)

8

as well as invariant under reparametrization

x = pp

, p = 0 , e = e

, e = 0

e = e

, p = e + p ,

p(i) = p(f ) = 0

(35)

in eq.(33) the bosonic (e, p) lagrange multipliers and the majorana-weyl (, +)

lagrange multipliers are associated with the bosonic and fermionic rst class constraints
e = p2 + z 2 = 0, t = t+ = 0.

one notices that in the new phase space action of eq.(33) only the linear combination
i+ +6p of new fermionic degrees of freedom appears. the orthogonal combination does
not appear in the action and is thus decoupled from any dynamics of the system. this

batalin-fradkin decoupling (see refs.

[12]-[14]) assures that the correct independent

degrees of freedom denes the extended symmetric system. namely, we started with
(64 16 2 16 =) 16 fermionic degrees of freedom in phase space, 32 degrees of freedom
were added and the + symmetry was introduced. we have now (64+32162162 =
16+16) 16 independent degrees of freedom as in the original system while the other 16 are

the batalin-fradkin decoupled degrees of freedom. in the extended symmetry system,

in addition to the possible gauge xing (e.g.

[8][9]) that eliminates the  degrees of

freedom by xing the  gauge, other gauge xings are acceptable as well. clearly, as

seen in eq.(34), a properly chosen gauge xing ( unitary gauge xing) of the new +

symmetry will eliminate the linear combination of the new fermionic degrees of freedom
i + +6p. other combinations of  and + gauge xings are also possible.

an interesting set of constraints is dened by:

these constraints satisfy the following poisson bracket relations:

[ t

[ t

(37)

we note in the p2  z 2 limit, t 

 are functions of (+, ) and ( 
i , +  i+) only. it is expected, in this limit, that the system behaves as the n=2
massless superparticle - a system with 16 independent fermionic degrees of freedom in its

+ and t 

phase space, as seen also directly from the action in eq.(10). indeed, one notes that not
only  and + appear only in the linear combinations  + i+6p but now also  + i+6p
is the only linear combination of  and + that appears in the constraints. thus, after

taking into account the decoupling of their orthogonal linear combination and the fact

) while ( t 

that the fermionic degrees of freedom in phase space are now constrained by 16 rst
class constraints ( t 
+) are now second class only (since p2 + z 2 6= 0), one
nds indeed in the p2  z 2 limit only 16 independent fermionic degrees of freedom as
for the n=2 massless superparticle. namely, 64 + 32  16  2  16 = 16 + 16 + 16
where the last 16+16 fermionic degrees of freedom are decoupled in the same sense as the

batalin fradkin decoupling (do not appear in the constraints or in the hamiltonian of

the extended system).

the path integral formulation[15] of the system in eqs.(30-31) with  and + sym-

metry which has only rst class constraints is given by:

s = z f

i

d {p x + +  +  + +  + + +  +  + + p p

 p+p  pp+  4 p 6pc + 4z p(c+  +c) }

(p2 + z 2)  t+  t+

2

(38)

here, c and p are canonical pairs of bosonic ghosts and p and c are canonical
pairs of bosonic anti-ghosts, associated with the fermionic constraints t+ and t. the

majorana-weyl +,  are the canonical conjugates of the lagrange multipliers , +.

the bosonic p is the canonical conjugate of the lagrange multiplier p associated with
the constraint p2 + z 2 = 0 and + , + are gauge xings. the fermionic ghost and
its canonical conjugate are denoted by c and p, and the canonical pairs of fermionic
anti-ghosts as p , c .

10

the last 3 lines in eq.(38) are given by: [, ] where the brst operator  is given

by:

(p2 + z 2) + 2 p c6pc + 2z p( cc+  c+c)

and the gauge xing  is given by:

(39)

(40)

the above , + symmetric d0 dened in the extended phase space (, , +, )

is physically equivalent to the ordinary d0 with  symmetry of eq.(11). this, as men-

tioned,is demonstrated by choosing a unitary gauge xing + that sets the extended
phase space variables  + i+6p to zero. on the other hand the above symmetric system
accepts many dierent gauge xings + and  giving dierent presentations of the d0

brane.

a possibly interesting extension of this work is the derivation, in a similar fashion, of

the , + symmetric dp brane[17].
