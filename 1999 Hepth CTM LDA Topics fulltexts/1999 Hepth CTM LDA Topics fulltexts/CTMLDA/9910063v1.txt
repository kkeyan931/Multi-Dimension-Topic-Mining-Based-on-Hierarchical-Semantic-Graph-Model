abstract

we discuss the use of derivative expansion techniques for the construction of thermal

eective potentials. we present a theory for which the thermal bubble is analytic at the

origin of the momentum-frequency space, although the internal propagators in the loop

have the same mass. this means that, for this theory, the thermal eective potential

is uniquely dened. we then examine a slightly dierent theory for which the thermal

bubble displays the usual non-analyticity at the origin and the thermal eective potential

is not uniquely dened. for this latter theory we compare our results with those of other

works in the literature which employ the derivative expansion but nd a uniquely dened

thermal eective potential. we raise several questions concerning the interchange of the

order of the perturbative and the derivative expansions, the thermal generalization of

some non-perturbative zero temperature methods and the use of the periodicity of the

external bosonic eld. finally, we re-examine the physical interpretation given to the

imaginary part of the thermal bubble in the literature.

1 introduction

it is well-known that for most theories at nite temperature the self-energy displays a non-

analytic behaviour at the origin of the momentum-frequency space [1, 2]. this non-analyticity
manifests itself in a dierence between the {q0  0, q  0} and {q  0, q0  0} limits of the
self-energy, where q0 and q are the components of the external momentum q = (q0, q) and the

component listed rst goes to zero rst. the rst limit leads to screening and the static potential

whereas the second limit has been used for the calculation of the plasma frequency [3, 4]. one

may argue that the two limits must dier since they refer to dierent physics [3]. however there
is a problem with this argument. the plasma frequency does not involve the {q  0, q0  0}
limit but rather the q0   limit [5]. it is because the latter limit is independent of q to
lowest order that we appear to nd the same result as with the former limit. this means that
the physical signicance of the {q  0, q0  0} limit is not well-understood yet.

the non-analyticity of the self-energy at the origin of the momentum-frequency space puts in

jeopardy the construction of an eective potential based on the derivative expansion technique

[6, 7]. historically, this problem was rst pointed out in the bcs theory context by abrahams

and tsuneto [8]. later it was also seen to appear in a wide range of theories. in thermal qcd it

occurs in the gluon [4,9] and in the quark self-energy [10,11]. furthermore, it appears in all one-

loop diagrams that have zero or two external quarks and any number of external gluons [12,13].

the problem is also present in the graviton self-energy [14, 15] and in higher-order graviton

diagrams [16]. even in the much simpler case of interacting scalars the non-analyticity of the

self-energy persists [1, 17, 18].

the reason for this behaviour is that temperature eects give rise to landau terms and

these are responsible for the development of a new branch cut in the complex plane of the

external momenta with a branch point at the origin, besides the usual one which is already

present at zero temperature [2, 19]. the usual branch cut exists for

and the new one for

s = q2

0  |q|2  4m2

s = q2

0  |q|2  0.

1

an interesting remark is that, whenever the internal propagators in a typical loop have

dierent masses, the self-energy is analytic at the origin [20]. in this non-degenerate mass case

the usual branch cut is

and the new one is

s  (m1 + m2)2

s  (m1  m2)2

where m1 and m2 are the masses of the particles in the internal loop. the new branch point

in not at the origin anymore and the problem disappears from this point, allowing thus the

denition of a unique eective potential. however the non-degenerate mass case is of limited

physical interest [20].

we shall present a theory which exhibits a new and unexpected feature. the model of

section 2 has self-energy which is analytic at the origin, although the mass is degenerate. in

section 3 we show how subtle this new feature is and how the non-analyticity can develop, if we

modify slightly our model by replacing the parity conserving interaction term with a similar but

parity violating one. finally, in section 4, we compare our results with other in the literature.

2 a new case

we consider the following model

l[ , , ] = (i6   m)  ig 5 + l0[]

(1)

where l0[] is the free klein-gordon lagrangian. the boson is taken to be a pseudo-scalar

quantity.

we consider (x) to be an external eld and we want to obtain the one loop contribution

to the eective action which is given by

where is1[] and is1 are matrices whose elements in coordinate representation are

e [] = i ln

det[is1[]]

det[is1]

(2)

2

hx|is1|yi = (i6 x  m)(x  y)

hx|is1[]|yi = (i6 x  m  ig5(x))(x  y).

since the external eld depends on the coordinates, the resulting functional determinants are

not straightforward to calculate. the matrices whose functional determinants we want to

evaluate are not diagonal in momentum or in coordinate space. however, progress can be

made, if we rewrite (2) as:

now we expand the above expression in powers of the coupling constant and show that the

e [] = itr ln [1  g5(x)s(p)].

(3)

leading contribution to the one-loop eective action is

(2) =

the trace, is given by

i(q) = 4z

k2 + kq  m2

[(k + q)2  m2][k2  m2]

.

(6)

this is one typical diagram that usually has a non-analytic behaviour in the limit of vanishing

external momenta but we are going to show that this is not the case here. we keep this

intermediate expression, because it will help us to show in the next section how the non-

analyticity can develop in the scalar-coupling model.

applying the usual nite temperature techniques to (6), we nd the following expression

for the thermal bubble diagram.

we conclude that the limits coincide. moreover, the only term that contributes to the unique

result is the rst one in the integrand of equation (10) and those proportional to landau terms

- the last two terms inside the integrand - vanish in this limit.

a more general way of seeing that the limits are the same is to perform the angular inte-
gration and then use the parameterization q0 = a|q|, where a can be any real number, and nd
the limit of (a|q|,|q|) as |q|  0. if the limit is independent of a, we have a strong indication
that the function is analytic at the origin, i.e. it does not depend on the way one approaches

the origin [1, 20]. before doing so we recast equation (10) in a more convenient form by means
of the transformation k  (k + q) wherever the integrand contains tanh 

2 . then we nd

if q0 is made complex and continuous, the only poles or zeros of the sum of ls in (13) occur for

q0 on the real axis. it is perfectly appropriate to have singularities on the real axis. thus the

analytic extension of (13) is trivially obtained by letting q0 be real. there are three self-energies

on the real axis.

r(q0,|q|) = (q0 + i,|q|) a(q0,|q|) = (q0  i,|q|) f (q0,|q|) = (q0 + iq0,|q|)

where   0+. the real parts of these self-energies coincide whereas the imaginary parts are

we note that the real part of the self-energy is even under q0  q0, since it can be written as
a function of q2
0, if we combine the logarithms. it is also even under q  q, since it depends
only on |q|.

(17)

we note that it is odd under q0  q0. however it is even under q  q, because we
can simultaneously change the integration variable k  k . this means that, unlike the
real part, the imaginary part of the retarded or advanced thermal self-energy does not con-

tribute to the eective action. as we can see from (4), the integrand of the eective action is
(q0, q) (q0,q) (q0, q) and therefore the contribution (q0, q) (q0,q) im(q0, q) is
odd under the combined transformations q0  q0 and q  q and vanishes, when integrated
over d4q.
we proceed to the parameterization q0 = a|q| and examine the behaviour of the real part of the
self-energy as |q|  0. the limits of two of the regular terms rel1 and rel2 are independent
of a, as they should be. we can see that

lim
|q|0

(a2  1)|q|rel1 = 0

lim
|q|0

(a2  1)|q|rel2 = 0.

what is quite unexpected is that, for this particular model, the contributions coming from the

landau terms, rel3 and rel4, vanish independently of a, that is

lim
|q|0

(a2  1)|q|rel3 = 0

lim
|q|0

(a2  1)|q|rel4 = 0.

in other words, although the landau terms are not well-behaved at the origin of momentum

here thanks to the kinetic term in the numerator of equation (12), namely q2

space, a unique eective potential up to second order in the coupling constant can be dened
0  q2. this is an
interesting result but this kinetic term does not always appear in bubble diagrams as we are

7

going to see in the next section. in the present case the one-loop, g2 order contribution to the

eective potential is

(18)

this result for the eective potential coincides with the one we would have found, had we not

added to the real q0 the innitesimal imaginary part which corresponds to physical boundary

conditions. the next order in the derivative expansion is non-analytic since the derivatives of

the landau terms become dominant and the derivative expansion breaks down.

3 a usual case

in this section we shall consider a model whose only dierence from the one which we examined

in the previous section is that its interaction term does not contain the 5 matrix.

l[ , , ] = (i6   m)  ig  + l0[].

(19)

as we shall soon see, this simple modication of the interaction term has far-reaching con-

sequences as far as the analytic properties of the thermal self-energy are concerned. starting

from (19) and following the procedure of the previous section we nd that the one-loop eective

action is

e [] = itr ln [1  g(x)s(p)].

(25)

this result for the eective potential coincides with the one we would have found, had we not

added to the real q0 the innitesimal imaginary part which corresponds to physical boundary

conditions.

this eective potential is not uniquely dened, because it depends on a which can take any

real value. comparing (6) to (21), we see that dropping 5 from the interaction resulted in

changing the relative sign between the momentum terms and m2 in the numerator. this slight

change was enough to allow for the development of a self-energy which is non-analytic at the

origin.

4 comparison with other works

the purpose of this section is to compare our results with others in the literature.

4.1 comparison with dolan and jackiw

for the theory examined in section (3) the one-loop eective potential at order g2 is given by

(25). in [21] the same theory was considered and, setting the external eld to be constant,

dolan and jackiw obtained the following exact expression for the one-loop eective potential

(27)

one can reproduce equation (27) by setting (q0, q) = (0, 0) in formula (21) and then performing

the matsubara sum. however, the correct thing to do is to perform the sum rst so that the

10

explicit form of the self-energy as a function of q0 and |q| is obtained. then the behaviour
of this function can be investigated in the limit (q0, q)  (0, 0). we therefore conclude that
the non-perturbative method employed in [21] is not generally equivalent to the perturbative

calculation, because it fails to take into account the non-analyticity which appears at the origin

of the space of external momenta.

it would be interesting to investigate further why our result doesnt coincide with the one

derived in [21]. instead of just comparing the nal results we shall try to nd out in which stage

of the calculation the dierence between [21] and us arises. first we perform a perturbative

expansion of the logarithm in (20) over the coupling constant:



e [] = iz

d4k
(2)4 trhk| g (x) s(p) +

1
2

g (x) s(p) g (x) s(p) + ...|ki.

(28)

if we wish to reproduce the result of [21], we do the derivative expansion of (x), truncate

it to zeroth order and substitute the constant term  in (28). each term of the expansion

depends only on the momentum operator and is diagonal in momentum space. therefore the

eective action can be resummed as follows



e [] = i

(29)

this is the eective action of [21] which, after some dierentiation trick explained therein, yields

the eective potential (26).

however, if we want to nd contributions to the eective action of the form (4) with the

self-energy given by (21), then, before performing the derivative expansion, we should introduce

complete sets of intermediate states in (28) and let the momentum and space operators act on

them. this yields



e [] = i(gz d4xz

(30)

where (q) is the fourier transformation of (x). the nal step of our calculation is to perform

the derivative expansion of (x) and keep only the constant term. thus we obtain,



e [] = i(g  z

(31)

as we have already mentioned, at nite temperature, doing the integration (the matsubara

sum) rst and then taking the limit in the second term of (31) is not equivalent to taking

the limit of the integrand rst and then performing the integration (the matsubara sum).

comparing (29) to (31) we can clearly see that this dierence is due to the interchange of the

order with which we perform the derivative expansion and the action of the momentum and

space operators on the bras and kets. replacing (x) with the constant  in the beginning of

the calculation, as dolan and jackiw do, means that we lose the operator behaviour of the 

eld.

before proceeding, we shall add a further comment.

if we had applied the limit before

performing the angular integration in (22), we would have found

which depends on a and diers from the result of dolan and jackiw, as (25) does. this new

result would have an additional property compared to (25), it would reduce to the result of
dolan and jackiw in the {q0  0, q  0} limit or equivalently in the a  0 limit. this property
is frequently mentioned in the literature, see for example [22]. however it is an artefact of

interchanging the limit with the integration and this is why we chose to perform the angular

integration rst.

12

4.2 comparison with gribosky and holstein

there is another work [22] where gribosky and holstein claim that they have a model which

doesnt display the usual non-analyticity at the origin of the momentum-frequency space. ac-

tually they employ two ways of proving this, a non-perturbative way and a perturbative one.

however weldon in his paper [1] proves that at least the perturbative way of gribosky and

holstein is wrong. the reason is that feynman parameterization at nite temperature is not

as straightforward as it is at zero temperature and performing it naively, as gribosky and hol-

stein did, gives misleading results. there is one issue which still remains open though; where is

the mistake in the non-perturbative approach of gribosky and holstein? let us examine this

matter in some more detail. the model which the two authors consider is the following:

l[b, ] = l0[b(x)] 

1
2

(x)(cid:16) + m2 + b(x)(cid:17) (x)

(33)

where l0[b] is the free klein-gordon lagrangian. the eective lagrangian and therefore the

eective action can be found from the coincident limit of the greens function for (x), see [23].

next they write down the dierential equation which denes the greens function:

(cid:16) + m2 + b(x)(cid:17) g(x, x



) = (x  x



).

(34)

the above equation cannot be solved for a general b(x), it is possible though to solve it,

if we perform the derivative expansion of b(x) around x and keep terms of up to second

order in derivatives. this method rst appeared in paper [24] by dittrich. our criticism

is that, although at zero temperature there is no problem with this approximation, at nite

temperature it amounts to replacing a periodic function with one that is not periodic.

in

other words b(x) obeys b( + ) = b( ) but the expansion which is truncated at second

or even at rst order in derivatives doesnt and consequently this non-perturbative method

cannot be applied at nite temperature. the fact that this is the reason for obtaining a result

which doesnt display the usual problem of non-uniqueness can be seen from the same paper of

gribosky and holstein [22]! in their perturbative approach they remark under their equation

(3.20b) that  thus, we see that extending (p) to continuous p0 without ever using p0 = 2il/

eliminates the non-analytic behaviour we encountered in r(p)  where r(p) is the self-energy

13

which they found after using (9) which follows from p0 = 2il/ (their p0 is our q0). however,

it is well-known that this expression for p0 is a direct consequence of the periodicity of b(x)

which is lost in the beginning of their non-perturbative calculation.

4.3 comparison with evans

the eects of retaining exp (q0) after the analytic continuation where recently re-investigated

in papers [25, 26] by evans. again the conclusion is that keeping this exponential cures the

non-uniqueness of the thermal eective potential. we can also see this in our own calculation.

as we have already shown in section (3), the theory examined there has the usual problems of

non-uniqueness due to the  piece of the self-energy. let us see what happens to , if we

follow evans. letting q0 be real we recast (22) as follows





= 2m2 z d3k

 +  + q0
1  e(q0)
    q0

+

1

e(+q0) + 1

e

e(q0) + 1) .

(35)

we observe that, because we have retained q0 in the exponentials appearing in the numerators
of the four terms, the integrand of (35) does not have poles at q0 = +,,+, 
anymore. these poles of the integrand were responsible for the branch points of (23) at 0 and
0 |q|2 plane as explained in [19] and more generally in [27]. we know,
for example see [1], that the branch point at 0 is associated with the non-uniqueness of the

4m in the complex s = q2

eective potential and the elimination of this branch point leads to a unique eective potential.

however, it seems to us, that this general way out of the problem is incorrect. the argument

which evans gives for keeping exp q0 after the analytic continuation is the key idea is that

such (derivative) expansions describe eld congurations which vary slowly in time and space

and hence are not thermal equilibrium congurations (i.e. are not periodic in time). by explicit

calculation, i will show that the retarded thermal green functions used in previous analyses

are not relevant to this problem. these green functions describe how the system responds to a

sudden impulse as linear response theory shows. ( third paragraph of [25]). it is not clear to

us what the periodicity of a eld has to do with whether it is slowly or rapidly varying in time.

14

our point of view is that the truncated derivative expansion to 1st or higher order in derivatives

may not be periodic itself but, provided that the periodicity of the exact eld conguration is

not forgotten, it provides a good approximation, when we deal with slowly varying, periodic in

time, elds.

moreover, in all usual physical situations, the landau terms are expected to cancel each
other at the zero temperature limit. if exp q0 6= 1, (22) does not have this property unless
|q0| < . this reassures us that exp q0 must be set equal to 1.

4.4 comparison with weldon

it occurred to us that, although we are not convinced by the arguments presented in [25, 26],

there may be physical situations where the calculation of evans is correct for a dierent reason,

namely the exact conguration itself for the external eld may not be necessarily periodic.

in [19], weldon claims that, although the elds in the loop of the self-energy have to be

in thermal equilibrium, it is not necessary to assume that the external eld  is in thermal

equilibrium. initially, it should be taken to follow a non-equilibrium thermal distribution f0(q0).

at any later time this distribution will be denoted as f (q0, t). changes in f result both from
the processes    ,    ,    which decrease the number of s with rate f d and
from the processes    ,   ,    which increase the number of s with rate
(1 + f )i. thus f (q0, t) satises:

= f d + (1 + f )i.
for small departures from equilibrium one nds the solution

f
t

f (q0, t) =

+ c(q0) e(q0) t

(36)

(37)

eq0  1

where c(q0) is some arbitrary function. regardless of the distribution specied initially, f (q0, t)
inevitably approaches the equilibrium as t  . the rate of approach to equilibrium (q0) is
related to the imaginary part of the self-energy im through the relation im = q0(q0).

does this mean that the external eld is non-periodic and therefore exp q0 should be

retained after the analytic continuation? at this point one realizes that the calculation of [19]

15

was not performed consistently, since exp q0 was set to 1. this casts doubts concerning the

conclusions of this paper. furthermore, in our calculation, it is easy to see that retaining the

exp q0 leads to vanishing imaginary part of the self-energy.

the imaginary part of (35) is

(38)

similarly we can show that, if the exp q0 is retained, the imaginary part of (7) vanishes.

consequently, if we apply the conclusions of [19] in our case, we reach a contradiction;

the imaginary part of the self-energy gives the rate at which the thermal distribution of 
approaches the equilibrium as t  . this implies that at any nite time  is not in thermal
equilibrium and therefore not periodic. however this means that the imaginary part of the

self-energy vanishes, there is no approach to equilibrium and the physical interpretation given

in [19] seems to be meaningless.

5 conclusions

we have shown that in a model, where fermions couple to a pseudo-scalar eld, the eective

potential for the pseudo-scalar eld can be found uniquely at nite temperature. we have also

shown that this is not true when the fermion couples to a scalar eld, the reason for that being

the non-analytic behaviour which appears in the thermal bubble diagram.

we have pointed out that truncating in the beginning of the calculation the derivative

expansion either at the constant term [21] or at higher order [22,25,26] gives misleading results.

in the former case, because the operator nature of the background eld is lost, and in the latter

case, because the periodicity of the background eld is not taken into account.

finally we note that the models we dealt with in sections (2) and (3) can be considered

together to study chiral symmetry restoration at nite temperature for example in the lurie

16

model [28], the linear  model [29] in its broken chiral symmetry phase and in the nambu-

jona-lasinio model [30] expressed in terms of auxiliary elds.

in general, whenever nite

temperature symmetry restoration is discussed by employing non-perturbative results for the

eective potential, these may not match the perturbative results. therefore the question of

symmetry restoration at nite temperature should be reanalyzed keeping in mind the non-

analyticity of some graphs. work on this and other related issues is in progress.
