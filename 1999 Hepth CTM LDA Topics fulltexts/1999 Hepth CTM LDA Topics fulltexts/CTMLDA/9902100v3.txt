abstract

we begin by presenting the superparticle action in the background of n = 2, d = 4 supergrav-
ity coupled to n vector multiplets interacting via an arbitrary special kahler geometry. our
construction is based on implementing -supersymmetry. in particular, our result can be in-
terpreted as the source term for n = 2 bps black holes with a nite horizon area. when the
vector multiplets can be associated to the complex structure moduli of a calabiyau manifold,
then our 0-brane action can be derived by wrapping 3-branes around 3-cycles of the 3-fold. our
result can be extended to the case of higher supersymmetry; we explicitly construct the  su-
persymmetric action for a superparticle moving in an arbitrary n = 8 supergravity background
with 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 residual supersymmetry.

1 introduction

recently a lot of attention has been devoted [1] to the ads/cf t correspondence between
ddimensional supergravity compactied on manifolds of the form

adsp+2  mdp2

(1)

and conformal eld theories on the p+1dimensional boundary bp+1 of anti de sitter space:
in (1), mdp2 denotes a compact d  p  2dimensional manifold whose geometrical
structure largely determines the specic properties of the boundary conformal eld theory.
the situation envisaged by this correspondence arises in the context of bps pbrane
backgrounds with a suitable horizon behaviour. these are classical solutions of d
dimensional supergravity that interpolate between two dierent vacua, namely at d
dimensional minkowski space at innity and the product manifold (1) near the horizon
[2].
in addition they are bps states in the sense that they preserve some amount of
supersymmetry. as a consequence of this there is a saturation of a bound relating the
mass density to the charge.

actually pbranes are solutions of supergravity plus sources (see for instance [3]): in-
deed one has to supplement the bulk supergravity action with the world-volume action of
pextended objects carrying the charges measured at spatial innity.

the construction of these worldvolume actions for pbranes is mainly based on the
principle that they should be supersymmetric, namely that there should be a suitable
projection of the target space supersymmetry that is promoted to a local fermionic sym-
metry on the world volume. implementing supersymmetry on the world-volume puts
the background supergravity elds on shell and requires that the superspace bianchi iden-
tities be satised [4, 5, 6]. furthermore, by gauge-xing the -symmetry, one halves the
target space fermionic coordinates providing the correct number of bosons and fermions
for a supersymmetric world-volume theory.

when the supersymmetric action that describes the coupling of the pbrane to
generic supergravity backgrounds is known, one can study its properties in any given
background solution. choosing an appropriate gauge one derives a consistent world-
volume eld theory that inherits as global (super)symmetries the (super)isometry group
of the chosen background. for instance, in the background (1) one can derive a super-
conformal eld theory on the anti de sitter boundary bp+1 starting from the pbrane
worldvolume action [7]. indeed in this case the supersymmetric extension of the anti de
sitter isometry group so(2, p + 1) acts as the superconformal group on bp+1. such a con-
struction has been used recently to investigate the properties of the singleton conformal
eld theory living on the anti de sitter boundary of m2 [6] and 3-branes [8].

the bps blackhole solutions of d=4 supergravities [9, 10, 11] t into the above
scheme as instances of 0branes. however the -supersymmetric action for superparticles
has been derived so far only in the case of a pure n = 2 supergravity background [12].
the purpose of this paper is to extend such a construction to more general supergravity
backgrounds. firstly we present the case of an arbitrary n = 2, d = 4 background

1

provided by supergravity coupled to n vector multiplets interacting via a generic special
kahler geometry. secondly we extend our result to n = 8 supergravity.
the main new issue involved in our programme is the coupling of the 0brane to the
scalar elds. as we are going to see this coupling occurs in a very simple and elegant way
through a real function

(2)

|z(, pi, qj )| =

where  is the number of preserved supercharges, sitting in front of the kinetic term. as it
will become apparent in the sequel the real function (2) is the modulus of the largest skew
eigenvalue of the eld dependent central charge tensor zab. the hat appearing in (2)
denotes a suitable projection operation that extracts the contribution from such largest
eigenvalue. the numbers pi, qj are the magnetic and electric charges of the black hole and
 are the scalar elds. in the n = 2 case the scalars belong to the vector multiplets, in
the n = 8 they belong to the graviton multiplet, but the form (2) of their coupling to the
superparticle action holds in both cases alike. this result could be heuristically justied
recalling that for a usual particle the world-line action is multiplied by the particle mass
and that in the case of a bps state the mass should be equal to the central charge. the
main dierence is that in supergravity the central charge is eld dependent.

our result will be derived requiring -supersymmetry: it has a general validity within
if the n = 2 supergravity model can be obtained
n = 2 or n = 8 supergravity.
from the type iib superstring compactied on a calabiyau (cy) threefold a geometric
interpretation of our 0brane action naturally arises: it corresponds to the wrapping of
the 3brane world volume action on a supersymmetric cycle of the calabiyau manifold.

2 n = 2 black holes solution
the bps black hole solutions of n = 2 pure supergravity have been introduced in [9].
they have been extended to the coupling with n vector multiplets in [10]. the interplay
between the bps conditions and special kahler geometry was found by [13]. in particular,
in this paper was claried the relation of the black hole entropy with the central charge
and the so-called geodesic potential. these concepts were further discussed in a vast
literature, see e.g. [11] for a review. the relevant features of these eld congurations are
the following ones:

1. the solutions are characterized by the vector of electric (qj ) and magnetic (pi)
 of the moduli (scalar elds

charges carried by the black hole and by the values zi
of the vector multiplet) at spatial innity.

2. the metric has a universal behaviour near the horizon r = 0, where it approaches

the bertottirobinson metric [14]

let us briey recall the basic ingredients of n = 2, d = 4 supergravity and the way in
which its bps black hole solutions arise. the bosonic part of the supergravity action is

note that p and q are not necessarily integer. indeed, the dirac quantization condition
gives that for two objects with charges (p, q) and (p, q)

(12)
to have integer p and q, allowing 1 as lowest value, we thus have to take k = 1/8. we
will however leave k arbitrary to facilitate comparison with other papers.

the black hole conguration solves the eld equations from the action (4) and satises
in addition the bps conditions, which are just the statement that the supersymmetry
transformations of the fermionic elds, the gravitino a

 and the gaugino ia, are zero:

0 = d a(x)  i
0 =  zi a(x)  1

is the central charge. the projection (15) halves the number of components of the spinors,
and it is the same projection, as we will see, satised by the  symmetry parameter.

in general the bps black hole solution depends on radial functions u(r) and zi(r), to

be determined below. the metric is

ds2 = e2u (r) dt2 + e2u (r) d~x2 ,

(r2 = ~x2)

(17)

(19)

(20)

only the upper sign is physical as argued in [18].

the rst order equations (19) have a xed point, which we put at r = 0, by the
x, and correspondingly the

condition  z(z, z, p, q) = 0. this denes the xed values zi
xed value of the central charge

z(p, q) = z(zx, zx, p, q) .

(21)

the xed point is the horizon. indeed, in the vicinity of the xed point the dierential
equation for the metric becomes:

du
dr
which has the asymptotic solution:

= k|z(p, q)|

r2

exp[u(r)] r0 const + k|z(p, q)|

(22)

(23)

hence, near r = 0 the metric (17) becomes of the bertottirobinson type (3), with
bertottirobinson mass:

mbr = 8k|z(p, q)| .

(24)

3 the  supersymmetric action of a 0brane

in this section we derive a simple formula for the world-line action of a 0brane moving
in the background geometry provided by a generic on shell eld conguration of n = 2
supergravity. in particular, our action describes the 0-branes corresponding to the black
hole solutions discussed above.

to write the world-line action we use polyakov rst order formalism. hence we intro-

duce the world-line einbein 1form

(25)
and the auxiliary 0forms a that, on shell, become the world-line components of the
space-time supervielbein, satisfying the supergravity bianchi identities [4, 5, 6]:

e = e d

v a = a e .

(26)

we write the following ansatz for the word-line action:

swl = 4k(cid:26)zm1

r(z, z) (cid:20)(cid:18)a v b +

1
2

a b e(cid:19) ab +

1
2

e(cid:21) +zm2 (cid:16)pj gj  qi f i(cid:17)(cid:27) ,

(27)

5

where (pj , qi) is the vector of integer magnetic and electric charges (11), while r(z, z) is
a real function of the scalar elds that we have to determine in such a way that the action
be -supersymmetric. furthermore, in the wess-zumino (wz) term we introduced an
integral over a 2dimensional manifold m2 whose boundary is the world-line m1 =  m2.
the normalization of the wz term is xed by (11) and the vector equation of motion.

the action (27) is to be independently varied with respect to:

1. the auxiliary 0-forms a. such a variation yields the identication (26) as a eld

equation.

2. the einbein e. such an equation yields:

ab a b = 1 ,

(28)

which is the intrinsic way of stating that the world-line metric is the induced one
from the target space-time metric.
indeed eq. (28) can be read in the following
way:

dx

h  = 1 ,

h  = e e

where

h  =

(30)

denotes the contravariant world-line metric.

3. the target superspace coordinates x and . this yields the second order eld equa-

tions.

to discuss -supersymmetry we need the ordinary n = 2 supersymmetry transformation
rules of the bosonic elds [19, 16]:

eld strength is gj :

 we need introduce a dual magnetic potential bj| whose

gj = dbj = 1

(32)

by consistency, the supersymmetry transformation rule of the dual magnetic potential bi
is dened as:

 bi| = 2 fi abab + 2fi a

 bab (cid:16)hi|i

iab ab + hi|



ab ab(cid:17) .(33)

the  transformation is simply a supersymmetry transformation where the supersym-

metry parameter a = a is projected on the 0 brane through the following equations:

a + aba a bei = 0 ,
a + aba a bei = 0 ,

(34)

where  is an appropriate phase that we identify below. note that the above 0-brane
projection on the -supersymmetry parameter is identical in form to the condition (15)
imposed on the parameter of the supersymmetry preserved by the bps black holes. this
can be easily checked by going to a static gauge where the world-line time  is identied
with the coordinate time t.

now we prove the following statement: the action (27) is -supersymmetric if the real

function is chosen as follows:

r(z, z) = 2|z(z, z)| .

(35)

we obtain the proof by direct verication using the 1.5 order formalism. this means
that we vary the action (27) only in the superspace coordinates x and  and after variation
we implement the eld equations of the auxiliary elds a and e.

with this proviso there are only three relevant variations, namely that of the vielbein
v a, that of the gauge elds ai, bj and that of the scalars zi, z. in this way we produce
two kinds of terms, those containing the gravitino a, a and those containing the gaugino
ia, 
a. such terms have to cancel separately. the variation of the gauge elds contains
both type of terms while the variation of the vielbein contains only the gravitino and the
variation of the scalars contains only the gauginos (see (31), (33)). let us concentrate
rst on the gravitino terms. we obtain:

4k

 swl = zm1

r(z, z) h a aa + a aai a

2qi zm1 (cid:16) x i a b ab + x i a b ab(cid:17)
+2pj zm1 (cid:16) fj a b ab + fj a b ab(cid:17) .

we simplify the terms in (36) that contain the a matrix by use of the projection property
(34):

a aa a = ei  ab a a bb a b = ei  ab a b a b ab
a aa a = ei  ab a a bb a b = ei  ab a b a b ab

= ei  ab a b

= ei  ab

a b ,

(37)

where we have also used the rst order equation (28). inserting (37) into (36) we see that
all the a, a terms cancel if

(36)

(38)

z (cid:16)pj fj  qi x i(cid:17) =  1
z (cid:16)pj fj  qi x i(cid:17) =  1

2r(z, z) ei  ,
2r(z, z) ei  .

7

hence we conclude that

r(z, z) = 2| z |

; (z, z) =

i
2

log

z
z

.

(39)

at this point the action is completely xed and no further parameters can be adjusted.
the very non trivial check of supersymmetry is that the same choices (39) needed to
cancel the gravitino terms guarantee the cancellation of gaugino terms as well. to verify
this, we need consider the variation of the real function r(z, z). we obtain:

r(z, z) = 

1

|z| h z iz zi + z  z zi

= ei (cid:16)pi hi|i  qj f j

i (cid:17) ia a  ei(cid:16)pi hi|  qj f j

 (cid:17) 

a a .

(40)

1

note that in deriving (40) we have used the property that the central charge is covariantly
holomorphic z = 0. using (40) we conclude that at the level of the gaugino terms the
-supersymmetry variation of the world-line action is as follows:
 (cid:17) 
a a eii a v b ab
a ab abi v a .(41)
 (cid:17) 

i (cid:17) ia a ei +(cid:16)pi hi|  qj
i (cid:17) ia ab ab + (cid:16)pi hi|  qj f j

 swl = zm1h(cid:16)pi hi|i  qj f j

 h(cid:16)pi hi|i  qj f j

using the projection property (34) of the -supersymmetry parameter we can reduce the
terms containing the a matrix in complete analogy to (37):

4k

f j

ia a b ab v a = ei ia a bc b b c ab v a = eiiaa v ab ab ,

a a b ab v a = ei 

a a bc b b c ab v a = ei

aa v ab ab .

(42)

inserting the identity (42) into (41) we verify that all the gaugino terms cancel identically.
this concludes the proof of our statement.

now that we have shown that the action (27) is supersymmetric with the choice (39),
we can use the rst order eld equations (28) and (26) to recast the action in second order
form. to do this explicitly at the level of both the fermionic and bosonic coordinates we
would need an explicit parametrization of the space-time supervierbein v a in terms of
both x and . for the bosonic part we obtain

s = 4k(cid:20)2zm1 |z|qh  d +zm2 (cid:16)pj gj  qi f i(cid:17)(cid:21) ,

(43)

where the induced metric h  , dened by (30), is given in (29). note that the mass we
nd here as a source term for gravity agrees with (24).

4 derivation from 3-brane wrapping

the 0-brane action constructed in the previous section has a fully general validity. indeed,
as we emphasized above, its  supersymmetry relies only on the general identities of special

8

kahler geometry, irrespective of whether the vector multiplet complex scalars zi, z can
be interpreted as moduli of a calabiyau manifold or not.

in the case where vector multiplets are associated with complex structure moduli of a
calabiyau threefold mcy giving the compactication of type iib string theory from 10
to 4 dimensions, then our 0brane action admits a geometrical interpretation as the result
of wrapping 3-branes along suitable 3cycles. for simplicity, we restrict our attention to
the bosonic action (43). the full identication is guaranteed by -supersymmetry that
has already been proven.

we start from the bosonic world-volume action of a 3-brane in type iib string theory;
for our purpose we can limit ourselves to its nambugoto kinetic term and its coupling
to the ramondramond 4-form, namely

s3 = 

t3

10 zm4

d4q det hmn + 3zm5

f +

5 .

here hmn() is the induced metric

hmn =

x m
m gm n

x n
n ,

(44)

(45)

where gm n is the ten-dimensional metric, and the elds x m () describe the embedding
of the brane in the ten-dimensional space. the tension of the 3-brane is t3 =  and
it is related to its rr charge by the bps condition 3 = 2t3. further, 10 is the 10-
dimensional gravitational coupling constant which appears in the einstein-hilbert part of
the bulk type ii supergravity action as

siib = 

1
22

10 z d10x g r(x) + . . . .

(46)

we wrote the wess-zumino term as an action on a ve-dimensional manifold m5 having
the 3-brane world-volume m4 as its boundary.

we compactify the theory to 4 dimensions on a calabiyau space; accordingly, we
decompose the 10-dimensional coordinates as x m = (x, y, y ). the metric has a direct
product form: the only non-zero entries are g, the 4 dimensional metric, and g ,
the metric on the cy space. notice that upon compactication, the integral over the
calabiyau space contributes in (46) with a factor

vcy =zmcy

i d3y d3 y (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)det g (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

(47)

the volume of the cy manifold. therefore, the eective gravitational constant in 4 di-
mensions, that, as usual, we have conventionally taken to be 1, is

this will be important below.

(48)

we consider the case in which the 3-brane is wrapped on a non-trivial 3-cycle of the

internal cy manifold. then the embedding of the brane is as follows:

x(0) ;

having split the coordinates on the world-volume as m = (0, i), with i = 1, 2, 3.

we now consider separately the kinetic terms and wz-terms.

wrapping the kinetic term. although it is very simple, we do not write the explicit
form of the rst order 3-brane action since we can reach our conclusion by working directly
in second order formalism. the second order bosonic action of the 3-brane (44) is given
in terms of the induced metric (45). due to the direct product structure of the metric g,
the metric hmn is block diagonal, and det(hmn) is a product of h00 =  xg x times
the determinant of the 3  3 matrix

hij = 2

y
(i

y 
i) g  ,

that is the pullback of the cy kahler metric g  on the 3-cycle.

(50)

(51)

as a next step we show that the integral on a 3cycle c3 of the spatial part of the
kinetic action (44) is proportional (through a constant) to the modulus of the central
charge

d3qdet hij = 8k v 1/2
if c3 is a supersymmetric cycle [20]. a supersymmetric 3-cycle of a cy is described by an
embedding f : c3  mcy satisfying two conditions.

(53)

where  is the unique holomorphic 3form on the cy space, and in our conventions
di  dj  dk = ijkd3. then the phase of  has to be constant. as it will become
evident, this is a minimal volume condition.

it is not guaranteed a priori that supersymmetric representatives exist in any cohomology
class; their existence may thus restrict the allowed values of electric and magnetic charges.
the latter specify indeed, as we shall see below, the cohomology class of the 3-cycle.

in order to compute det hij we need consider the induced metric on the world volume

det hij = 8|det(iy)|2 det g  ,

(54)

10

using the denition (50), combined with the rst of the two conditions dening a su-
persymmetric cycle, eq. (52). since  is covariantly constant on the cy threefold, its
norm

of the calabiyau kahler metric and insert it into (54). we nd

det hij =

(56)

where in the last step we used  = 123 det(iy), as it follows from (53).

which thus satises rmcy b  b = i. inserting (57) into (56) we obtain

(59)
it is now clear that the bound is saturated whenever the phase of  is constant over the 3-
brane. in virtue of condition (53) this happens for the supersymmetric cycles. therefore,
for these latter we obtain indeed (51), since the central charge can be expressed as

eq. (60) is established through the following steps. first one recalls that the holomorphic
symplectic section of special geometry is provided by the periods of the holomorphic 3-
form along an homology basis:

8k z =zc3

fb .

fj (cid:19) =(cid:18)rai b

(cid:18) x i
c3 = 8k(cid:16)qi ai + pj bj(cid:17) .

(60)

(61)

(62)

then one interprets the electric and magnetic charges of the blackhole as the components
of the cycle c3 in the same homology basis:

the overall factor is introduced because p and q have arbitrary normalization. considering
(12), we see that the minimal value of q and p is 1/(8k), leading to the factor above.
comparing with (16), this leads immediately to (60).

11

in this way we have established that wrapping along a supersymmetric 3-cycle the

kinetic term of the 3-brane is

(63)

which is the kinetic term of the 0-brane in the form we have discussed in the previous
section.

wrapping the wess zumino term. to obtain the wz part of the 0brane action,
we consider the wz action for the 3-brane action (44), written as an action on a ve
dimensional manifold m5, having the 3-brane world-volume as its border. the ramond-
ramond eld strength f +
5 is real and self-dual. using the results in (135), it contains upon
compactication selfdual eld strengths in 4 dimensions multiplied with (3, 0) and (1, 2)
forms and antiselfdual eld strengths with (0, 3) and (2, 1) forms. considering kahler
weights and symplectic invariance we x the expression of the wz action in terms of the
graviphoton and matter eld strengths t and gi dened in (14):

s3,wz = 3bzm5hb(3,0)(i)t + + b(1,2)

(64)
the factor b should be chosen such that b times the integral gives 2 , according to the
quantization condition, (see e.g. (13.3.12) and (13.3.13) in [21]). here, b(3,0) is the (3, 0)
form which we previously just denoted as b, while b(1,2)
by kahler covariant derivatives from its complex conjugate b(0,3). this expression (64) is

symplectic covariant. indeed, due to the special kahler identity

2g+  + c.c.i .

are a basis of (1, 2) forms provided





it can be written as

 ix it + + 2 f i

 g+  = f + i ,

s3,wz = 3bzm5(cid:16)b(3,0)

b(1,2)
where y is the invertible (n + 1)  (n + 1) matrix
f i
 ) .

y = ( x i



(cid:17) y 1f i+ + c.c. ,

(65)

(66)

(67)

the integral is performed over m5 which is m2 c3, the former being the manifold whose
boundary is the world-line m1 as in (27). we perform the integral over the supersymmetric
cycle c3, using (61), which can be written elegantly as
qj )(cid:18) 0

using (11) and (12) one establishes now that b(8k)4k/(8k2) = 2, as we demanded
before, thus b = 1. with 3 = 2 we nd the same result as in (43). putting together
the wesszumino and the kinetic term we have shown that the wrapping of the 3-brane
action over a supersymmetric cy cycle leads to the 0-brane action previously derived,
(43). let us note that in [22] it was shown that by wrapping a d3-brane on a cycle
of a t 6/z3 orbifold, one obtains a reissner-nordstrom black hole solution of n = 2
supergravity.

(69)

5 generalization to higher n supergravity, in partic-

ular n = 8

in this section we discuss how our result for the 0brane action coupled to n = 2 su-
pergravity can be extended to the case where the 0brane moves in a higher extended
supergravity background. in particular we focus on the case n = 8, for which the bps
black holes have been constructed and classied in [23],[24],[25].
as we show below the structure of the n = 8 0brane is very similar to that of the
n = 2 brane and it is almost its straightforward generalization. yet it is clear that
for n > 2, there is the possibility of having bps congurations that preserve dierent
fractions of supersymmetry. in particular, the bps black holes for the case n = 8 fall
into three dierent classes, depending on the fraction of supersymmetry


8

,  = 1, 2, 4 ,

(70)

that they preserve. similarly, we will discover that there are three classes of n = 8
0brane actions where the worldline supersymmetry has, respectively, 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8
of the 32 = 8  4 components possessed by n = 8 spacetime supersymmetry. indeed,
as it was already the case in n = 2 supergravity, the appropriate projection satised by
the supersymmetry parameter coincides with the projection equation satised by the
blackhole bps killing spinor. it follows from these introductory remarks that, in order
to discuss the n = 8 0brane actions we have to recollect some results and properties of
the corresponding blackhole solutions.
as it is extensively discussed in [24] and [11], the three cases  = 1, 2, 4 are char-
acterized by the structure of the central charge at innity or, more intrinsically, by the
covariance group of the corresponding killing spinor equation. in n = 8 supergravity the

13

central charge zab is an antisymmetric eld tensor transforming in the 28 representation
of su(8). by means of su(8) local transformations it can always be brought to normal
form, namely skew diagonalized as follows:

zab = diag(z1, z2, z3, z4) ;

 =(cid:18) 0
1

1

0(cid:19) ,

(71)

and the complex numbers zi(x) (i = 1, . . . , 4) are the four skew eigenvalues. the structure
of these eigenvalues at spatial innity (r  ) characterizes the three distinct orbits of
n = 8 black holes. if we consider the n = 8 supersymmetry algebra generated by these
killing spinors, where we have put zab in block-diagonal form (71), then the analysis of
the bps bound on a state of mass m reduces to the usual n = 2 analysis for each block.
thus we must have
(72)

m  |z1|  |z2|  |z3|  |z4| ,

having assumed in (71) a specic ordering of the eigenvalues. when all zi are dierent,
the bps bound can be saturated in the rst block only: m = |z1|2. if this is the case,
a combination of the supersymmetry charges with indices in the rst block annihilates
the state, and 1/8 of supersymmetry is preserved. when z1 = z2, the saturation of the
bps bound occurs simultaneously in the rst two block: m = |z1| = |z2|, leading to
2 preserved combination of supercharges (1/4 of the total number), and so on. when
all the eigenvalues of z are equal, bps saturation corresponds to conservation of 1/2 of
supersymmetry. the result is shown in table 1.

the stability subgroup gstab  su(8) of the central charge is related to, but not
identical to, the covariance group of the killing spinor equation. by denition of bps
state the supersymmetry transformations vanish in the blackhole background if they
are taken along a special supersymmetry parameter a, the killing spinor, satisfying a
suitable projection equation, which is the higher n generalization of (15).

as formulated in [26, 24, 25], such a condition is the following:

0 a = abb , 0 a = abb ,

where, in block notation,

ab = ab = diag (c22, 0(82)(82)) .

the real antisymmetric matrix c22 satises c2
that the killing spinors are projected to the upper 2  2 block:

a = ha

(75)

(76)

by the matrix

ha

b  ac cb = diag (cid:16)1122, 0(82)(82)(cid:17) .

the three choices  = 1, 2, 4 correspond to 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 of preserved supersymmetry,
respectively.

the invariance group ginv of the killing spinor equation (73) is ginv = usp(2) 
u(8  2), i.e. the su(8) subgroup that leaves the matrix ab unchanged.
the structure of the killing spinor projection is related to the structure of these
eigenvalues zi of the central charge. by direct construction of the bps black-hole solutions
indeed three distinct possibilities, listed in table 1, have been found.

comparing with our previous discussion we see that the two groups ginv and gstab
admit the common factor usp(2). however, ginv is bigger, as for its determination only
the blocks of z containing the highest eigenvalue(s) matter.

the analogy between the n = 8 equation (73) and its n = 2 counterpart (15) is
complete only if, in the latter case, we get rid of the phase z/|z| by imposing reality of
the central charge z = |z|. in the n = 2 theory this is a u(1) gauge choice that can
always be reached by means of suitable kahler transformations. however, as our previous
experience teaches, if we want a u(1) gauge covariant form of the supersymmetric
action we had better to keep the phase z/|z| in place and write the projection on the
symmetry parameter as given in (34). so, although the blackhole solutions of n = 8
supergravity have been derived starting from equations (73), the previous observations
suggest that such a construction is based on a su(8) gaugechoice that we had better
to undo in order to obtain an su(8) covariant form of the 0brane supersymmetric
actions.
indeed the role of u(1) is now played by the group su(8) which is both the
automorphism group of the n = 8 supersymmetry algebra and the isotropy subgroup of
the homogeneous scalar manifold.
to discuss the su(8) covariantization of the killing spinor equation (73) we have to

review the basic ingredients of the n = 8 theory and x our conventions.

5.1 scalar elds, e7(7) structure and the central charge

the theory possesses 70 scalar elds i that span the non compact coset manifold
e7(7)/su(8). using standard notations (see for example [11]) these elds are introduced
through the coset representative il() that is an e7(7) matrix in the fundamental 56
representation. we have:

il =

1
2



f + ih f + ih

f  ih f  ih

 ,

15

(77)

where the 2828 submatrices (h, f ) are labeled by antisymmetric pairs (, ) and (a, b),
with ,  = 1, . . . , 8 and a, b = 1, . . . , 8, the rst pair transforming under e7(7) and the
second one under su(8):

(h, f ) =(cid:16)h|ab, f 

ab(cid:17) .

(78)
as expected from general arguments we have il  usp (28, 28). indeed the theory con-
tains 28 gauge bosons so that we have 28 electric eld strengths and 28 magnetic ones
which have to transform one into the other through elements of the usp(28, 28) group.
the vielbein pabcd and the su(8) connection  b
a of e(7)7/su (8) are computed from
the left invariant 1-form il1dil:

that the 56 dimensional (anti)self-dual vector(cid:16)f  , g(cid:17) transforms covariantly under

basis, (77), to the real sp (56, ir) basis is the cayley matrix:

lf   . note

ab () g .

c =(cid:18) 11

ab = hab () f   f

in a way similar to the n = 2 case we also have the identities:

ab = 0  t ab = tab ;
t +

t ab = 0  t + ab = t ab .

thus we can dene the central charge:

zab =

1

zs 2

tab = h|abp  f

(86)

(87)

which, as we already anticipated, is an antisymmetric tensor transforming in the 28
irreducible representation of su(8). in (87) the integral of the two-form tab is evaluated
on any static 2sphere and the quantized charges (p, q) are dened, in analogy with
(11), (choosing in this section the normalization with k = 1/4) by

p =

 zs 2

f  ,

q =

g .

(88)

given these preliminaries let us now review the general form of the 1/2 and 1/4 bps
black hole solutions as constructed in [24] and compute the corresponding eld dependent
central charge. this gives us the opportunity to see, through explicit formulae, how the
killing spinor equation (73) can be translated in terms of the central charge and in this
way su(8) covariantized.

5.2 the 1/2 blackhole and its central charge

in the 1/2 supersymmetry-preserving case ( = 4), the killing spinor projection (73)
involves the matrix

so that the projector h b
a . recalling the results of [24], let us write the bps
blackhole solution admitting the gaugexed killing spinor (73), that contains a new
parameter q. the metric is

boundary condition h() = 1. typically one has:
q
r

h(x) = 1 +

,

(93)

where q is the same parameter appearing in (91).

inserting (91) in the integrals (88) we obtain the values of the electric and magnetic

charges for this solution:

and using (94) and (92) into (87) we obtain the central charge:

p = 0 ;

q =  q c ,

zab =

q
2

[h(x)]3/4 cab .

(94)

(95)

from the explicit form (95) we see that the central charge at spatial innity approaches
an antisymmetric matrix with four coinciding skew eigenvalues:

zab

r

q
2

cab ,

(96)

as expected from table 1. on the other hand near the horizon r  0 the central charge
goes to zero as r3/4. this conrms what we also expect on general grounds, namely that
the entropy of the black hole, proportional to the horizon value of (zab z ab)1/2 is zero
in the 1/2 susy case.

as we stressed at the beginning of this section, by writing the killing spinor equation
in the form (73) we have worked in a xed su(8) gauge. yet it is now quite easy to
relax this gauge choice by performing an arbitrary, local su(8) transformation on the
expression we have obtained for the central charge. let u(x)  su(8) be such a gauge
transformation. for the bps 1/2 susy preserving black-hole we get

where

zab(x) = (x)hu(x)c u t (x)iab

,

(x) = (x) 

q
2

[h(x)]3/4

(97)

(98)

is a unique real skew eigenvalue characterizing the central charge at any point in space
time. since by denition of the usp(8) group the matrix c is invariant against such
transformations, it follows that in (97) we have introduced 63  36 = 27 new arbitrary
functions parametrizing the coset manifold su(8)/usp(8). they are the n = 8 analogue
of the single phase z/|z| appearing in the n = 2 theory. yet, what matters and is an
intrinsic property of the 1/2 background is that: in any spacetime point the four skew
eigenvalues of the central charge zab are real and coincide.

18

from this property it follows an identity which will be crucial in proving the 
supersymmetry of the 0brane action. indeed, using the expression (97) for the central
charge, we have

note that the last equality follows precisely from the reality of the skew eigenvalue (x).

let us now turn our attention to the 1/4 susy preserving blackholes.

5.3 the 1/4 black hole and its central charge

in the 1/4 case ( = 2) we have:

and following [24] it is convenient to introduce the further notations:

ab = ba = diag (c44, 044) ,

ab = ba = diag (044,c44) ,
(ab  ab) = 1

2 diag (c44,c44) .

then the bps blackhole solution admitting the gaugexed killing spinor (73) can be
written as follows. the metric is

ds2 =  [h1(x) h2(x)]1/2 dt2 + [h1(x) h2(x)]1/2 d~x2 .

(106)

(107)

(108)

whose four skew eigenvalues are real and coincide in pairs as expected from table 1. on
the other hand near the horizon r  0 the central charge goes to zero as r1/2. also in
this case the entropy is zero.
once again, we can remove the su(8) gauge xing utilized in deriving the 1/4 bps

solution by writing the analogue of (97), namely:

where

zab =hu(x)(cid:16)1(x)  +
1 (x)#1/4

1(x) = 

h 3

5.4 the supersymmetry projection and the 0brane action

for the cases of 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 bps backgrounds

having claried these preliminaries we can now proceed to write the appropriate su(8)
covariant form of the projection on the -supersymmetry parameter a, a and the world-
line action that is invariant against such  transformations.

recalling equation (76) we introduce an 8  8 projection matrix:

p (2)b

a

(x) hu(x) h(2) u(x)ia

20

b ,

(111)

where u(x)  su(8) is the point dependent su(8) gauge transformation that skew
diagonalizes the central charge. such a transformation was already introduced in (97)
and (109). the parameter  takes the values  = 4, 2, 1 and distinguishes among the
three cases of /8 preserved supersymmetries. according to the conventions introduced
in equation (73), 2 is the rank of the projector p (2)a
(x). next we introduce the projected
central charge tensor:

b

bzab = p (2)c

a

(x)p (2)d

b

(x) zcd .

(112)

using such a notation the projection on either the killing spinor of the bps background
(73) or the  supersymmetry parameter can be rewritten in a manifestly su(8) covariant
fashion as follows:

aaa = 2 (cid:18)bzcd bz
aaa = 2 (cid:18)bzcd bz

the generalization of the condition (75) is

cd(cid:19)1/2
cd(cid:19)1/2

a = p b

b b .

(113)

(114)

the supersymmetric action of a 0brane moving in the background of a /8 supersym-
metry preserving n = 8 on shell conguration can now be written. it is an almost direct
generalization of (27) and reads as follows:

sn =8

(116)

the proof of supersymmetry can be done along the same lines as in the n = 2 case;
there are however a few subtleties that have to be taken into account, and that are
dierent in the three cases  = 4, 2, 1. first of all we need to recall the supersymmetry
transformation rules of n = 8 supergravity. they read as follows (see [27] and for current
notations [23, 24, 25] and [11]):

abc = 4 pabcd|iid + 3t ()

as before the supersymmetry is an ordinary supersymmetry transformation of the
background elds with a supersymmetry parameter satisfying a suitable projection, given
in this case by equation (113). the variation of the 0brane action is done as in (36),
(41) and (40) and we have to check the separate cancellation of the gravitino and dilatino
terms.

just as before let us begin with the gravitino terms. at this level we obtain the

variation:

sn =8

(2) = zm1

the second and third lines in equation (123) reconstruct the denition of the central
charge tensors zab, z ab. yet, because of (114), we can safely replace the central charges
with their hatted counterparts:

(124)
in the rst line of (123) we can reduce the terms involving the gamma matrix a by use
of the projection (113) and we obtain cancellation of the gravitino terms if the parameter
2 satises the condition (116). just as in the n = 2 case, the non trivial check is
to verify that the same coecient guarantees also the cancellation of the dilatino terms.
this indeed happens in a dierent subtle way for the three values  = 4, 2, 1.

at the level of the dilatino terms the supersymmetry variation of the 0brane action

reads as follows:

in deriving the above equation we have used the following dierential relation satised by
the central charge [28] and therefore by its projected version:

zab = pabcdz

cd  ()bzab = p a
the symbol  denoting the su(8) covariant derivative.
and utilizing the projection (113) we obtain:

(127)

where special attention must be paid to some details. in the rst line of (127) the term
[cdr s] is completely antisymmetrized in the indices cdrs, while the same term in
the second line of equation (127) is not antisymmetrized. moreover, some of the central
charge tensors appearing in equation (127) wear a hat, namely are projected, and some
do not.

we can now discuss the cancellation of the dilatino terms for the three values of .

case 2 = 8. here the projection operator p a

b is the identity operator and we have

zab = bzab. furthermore, in view of the identity (99) we see that the two terms

on the rst line of (127) are identical and sum together. on the other hand we also
have z [cd z r]s = z [cd z rs] so that the cancellation of the dilatino terms occurs if:

8 =

2 ,

1
2

(128)

which for  = 4 coincides with (116).

case 2 = 4. here there is a dierence between the bzab and zab. a little analysis is

needed to show that the rst and second term in the rst line together reconstruct
indeed all the possible cases present in the second line of (127), upon use of the
extension of the identity (99) to the case that one of the central charges is projected.
one eventually nds that, in agreement with (116), the dilatino terms cancel if

4 = 1 .

(129)

case 2 = 2.

in this last case the second term in the rst line of equation (127) vanishes
identically since there is antisymmetrization on the indices ij and s that all lie in a
twodimensional subspace. as for the rst term on the same line, in order to single
out the non vanishing contribution that can cancel against the similar term in the
second line one has to develop the antisymmetrization. we have:

cd

rs

z

[cdr s] =

bz

1

2bz

cd

rs

z

cdr s +

23

rs

2

z

cd bz

cdr s ,

(130)

and the rst of the two terms appearing in the right hand side of (130), vanishes
for the same reason as before. we cannot antisymmetrize in cdr when all of the
three indices lie in the twodimensional subspace singled out by the projection. on
the other hand the rst term in the right hand side of (130) can cancel against the
second line of equation (127). for this case, therefore, the dilatino terms cancels if:

2 = 2 ,

(131)

which is once again consistent with the  = 2 case of (116).

in this way we have completed the proof of supersymmetry and shown that (115) is
the correct 0brane action for all n = 8 supergravity backgrounds.

6 outlook

in this paper we have constructed 0brane actions for superparticles moving in generic
d = 4 supergravity backgrounds that preserve a residual fraction of supersymmetry.
typically such backgrounds are bps black holes. the main issue in writing these actions is
the coupling of the 0brane, not only to the metric and the gauge elds of the background,
but also to its scalar elds.

the main application of our result appears to be its possible use as an instrument to
investigate the structure and the properties of 1 + 0dimensional conformal eld theories
(superconformal quantum mechanics) living on the boundary of two dimensional anti-
de sitter space. indeed, in those cases where the black-hole entropy is nite, the near
horizon geometry of the black-hole is ads2  s2 and we can formulate the kaluzaklein
programme for d = 4 supergravity as its compactication on s2. in complete analogy
with [6] we can then study the conformal eld theory on the ads2 boundary starting from
our superparticle action. other applications are possible but this is the main one that
motivated us to undertake the present study.

in deriving our result, one main point that had to be cleared, was the correct for-
mulation of the projection equation satised by the -supersymmetry parameter. this
projection is identical with the equation satised by the bps killing spinor admitted
by the corresponding supergravity background. in previous literature this killing spinor
equation was written in xed u(n ) gauges. in the present paper we have restored its
complete u(n ) covariance, su(8) covariance for n = 8.

[16, 11, 23, 24, 25]. there are more small dierences in normalization between some of
the articles in the same group. in the table we use the most recent ones. a more detailed
comparison can be found in the appendix b of [29]. for n = 8, of course, a = 1, . . . 8,
and we use also ,  = 1, . . . 8, related to e7.
we adopt the notation where in any dimension 01...(d1) = 1, and the dual f of a
tensor f is dened such that it squares to the identity: f = f . with complex variables
in the cy (say y and y ), we have

holomorphic indices , . duality in 10 dimensional minkowski space should be dened

in order that f = f . taking a 5-form with only non-zero components f = f,
and taking the metric with g  = 1, the tensor with upper indices has non-zero com-
ponents f    = f . the factor i in (132) is absorbed in taking the dual in 4
dimensions, such that we have

f = f(3,0)

  f = f(3,0)
 .

(134)

for the other 3-forms in the cy some re-ordering of indices has to be made in the levi
civita tensor, such that

f = f(2,1)
f  = f(1,2)
f   = f(0,3)

  f =  f(2,1)
i   f   = f(1,2)
   f   =  f(0,3)
  .
