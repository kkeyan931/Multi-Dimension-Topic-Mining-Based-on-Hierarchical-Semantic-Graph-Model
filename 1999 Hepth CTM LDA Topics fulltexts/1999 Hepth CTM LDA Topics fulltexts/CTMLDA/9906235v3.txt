we discuss various dualities, relating integrable systems and show that these dualities

are explained in the framework of hamiltonian and poisson reductions. the dualities we

study shed some light on the known integrable systems as well as allow to construct new

ones, double elliptic among them. we also discuss applications to the (supersymmetric)

gauge theories in various dimensions.

1. introduction

traditionally the physical applications of integrable systems are exhausted by the

approximations to real dynamical systems. the congurations of the (classical or quantum)

model form the phase space which is a manifold m with the symplectic two-form  or

poisson bi-vector .

the phase space might carry a natural complex structure, such that the symplectic

form  is a holomorphic (2, 0)-form, the hamiltonians h(p, q) are the holomorphic func-

tions and the vector elds are holomorphic vector elds (see [1] for example). the use of

integrable systems as describing the evolution in the physical models is less transparent in

this case.

the integrable systems in the holomorphic sense entered physics approximately at the

same time as the string theory did. particle which has a one-real-dimensional worldline is

naturally described with the help of a real phase space, its (real) time evolution being gen-

erated by the real hamiltonian. the worldsheet of a string is a complex curve, embedded

into the target space. it senses holomorphic geometry in many dierent ways. in partic-

ular, the embeddings of the worldsheet  are governed by a two dimensional conformal

eld theory on . an example of holomorphic integrable system relevant to the latter is

the famous hitchin system. the phase space of this model is the cotangent bundle to the
moduli space mg() of holomorphic g-bundles over a riemann surface . one can think
of knizhnik-zamolodchikov-bernard [2] equations in two dimensional wzw theories as of

the non-stationary quantum version of hitchin system [3][4][5][6][7][8]. the role of times
is played by the complex (and hypothetically w)-moduli of . complex time evolution
occurs also in the models of n = (2, 2) strings, where space-time may have (2, 2) signature

[9].

however there exist other possibilities for integrable system to encode the physical

information.

in particular, the rich source of holomorphic integrable systems is the combination of

supersymmetry and duality. it is known for some time now that the holomorphy of certain
quantities (like the superpotential in n = 1 or prepotential in n = 2) in the supersym-
metric theories in three/four dimensions yields powerful predictions for the behavior of the

quantum theory even in the presence of the non-perturbative eects [10], [11], [12],[13],
[14], [15]. in particular, the complex structure of the moduli space of vacua in n = 4
3d gauge theories and n = 2 4d gauge theories can be determined revealing the exciting

2

link with the special nature of the geometry of the phase spaces of complex integrable

systems [16], [17], [18], [15]. the action variables appear as the central charges in the bps

representations of the susy algebra [16].

there exists an approach to a class of integrable system which allows to uncover the

origin of their integrability/solvability. namely, one realizes the system under investigation

as a projection of a simple system on a larger phase space [19],[20]. this idea is actually

a counterpart of the main principle behind the gauge theories - the complex dynamics

of the actual world (as far as most of the fundamental interactions are concerned) is a

projection of a somewhat simpler dynamics of the extended phase space. one of the goals

of the present discussion is to use the analogy between the two ideas and explain certain

properties of integrable systems as well as gauge theories.

we are going to study the phenomenon of duality whose precise denition is presented

shortly. duality is a subject of much recent investigation in the context of (supersymmetric)

gauge theories, in which case the duality is an involution, which maps the observables of

one theory to those of another. the duality is powerful when the coupling constant in one

theory is inverse of that in another (or more generally, when small coupling is mapped

to the strong one). for example, a weakly coupled (magnetic) theory can be dual to the

strongly coupled (electric) theory thus making possible to understand the strong coupling

behavior of the latter. in particular, it was shown by n. seiberg and e. witten [12] that
using the concept of duality one can nd exact low-energy lagrangian of n = 2,d = 4
su (2) gauge theory. a more fascinating recent development is that the duality connecting

weak and strong coupling regimes of one or dierent theories may have a geometric origin.

the most notorious example of that is provided by m -theory [21],[22]. we are going to

study the dualities in integrable systems, related to the gauge theories with the emphasis

on their geometric origin.

the study of geometry of integrable systems also allows to understand the origin of

certain constructions of separation of variables [23]. the similarity of this construction to

the description of the d2-brane moduli space and its role in the understanding the string

duality makes one hope that both subjects - many-body integrable systems and gauge

theories (more generally, d-geometry of m. douglas [24][25]) will benet more from each

other in the near future.

topics

left beyond the

scope

of

the paper. to keep the size of the paper within

reasonable limits we decided to restrict our attention with the pure many-body systems.

more or less everything we have said can be carried over to the spin systems both of the

3

adjoint [26][27] and fundamental [28] type. we dont discuss extensively the relation

of our dualities in integrable systems to the physics of d-branes [29][30][31]. some of

the results in this direction together with the applications to the theory of separation

of variables can be found in [23]. also, except for the general discussion and two-body

examples we dont treat quantum case. for some results related to our main topic see

[32][33][34][35]. realizations of elliptic ruijsenaars-schneider models via hamiltonian and

poisson reductions can be found in [36].

organization of

the paper. various concepts of duality are discussed in the section 2.

the examples of the dual systems are studied in section 3 where mostly two-body case is

treated, both classical and quantum one. many-body systems are studied in the section

4 with the explanation of the dualities between them coming from hamiltonian/poisson

reductions. the section 5 is devoted to the gauge dynamics and their relation to the

integrable systems discussed so far. we discuss the geometry of the moduli spaces of vacua

of supersymmetric gauge theories in three, four, ve and six dimensions and construct a

little dictionary translating the notions of integrable systems to those of gauge theories.

2. the concepts of duality:

let (m, ) be a symplectic manifold. there exist darboux local coordinates (cf. [37])

in which the symplectic form looks like a canonical one:

 =

mxi=1

dpi  dqi

(2.1)

the local canonical coordinates are dened up to the symplectomorphisms. unlike the gen-

eral dieomorphisms, which have n functional degrees of freedom, n being the dimension

of the manifold, the symplectomorphisms have only 1 functional degree of freedom.

the evolution of a hamiltonian system is dened with the help of hamiltonian h :

m  ir. the function h denes a hamiltonian vector eld by the formula

vh  = dh

(2.2)

the integrable system on m has a maximal collection of the functionally independent
commuting hamiltonians hi i = 1, . . . , m = 1

2 dimm :

[vhi , vhj ] = 0

(2.3)

let ~h : m  b  irm be the map dened as: ~h : x 7 (h1(x), . . . , hm(x)). liouvilles
theorem states that the integrable system has a normal form locally: there are coordinates
(ii, i), such that

dii  di

(2.4)

 =xi

hk = fk({i})

i.e. ik are coordinates on b. for a suciently small domain u  b the space ~h1(u ) is
the product uirnmt 2mn and k are standard linear coordinates on irnmt 2mn.
if the common level set of all hamiltonians is compact then this set is isomorphic to the

torus of the dimension m. in that case one may impose a condition on the coordinates
i that the dierentials di have periods which are integer multiples of 2. this xes the

coordinates (i, ) up to the action of discrete group pglm(zz).

the liouville theory also has a counterpart in the holomorphic setting where the

manifold m is replaced by the complex manifold, the symplectic form is a holomorphic

closed (2, 0)-form, the hamiltonians h are the holomorphic functions and the vector elds

are holomorphic vector elds. the liouville theorem modies in this case.

in fact the

6

liouville real tori are replaced by the complex tori. if we require these tori to be abelian

varieties then we get what is called algebraically integrable system [38]. in the family of

such varieties the degenerate bers can appear.

the coordinates ii are referred to as action variables. if n = m then there is a nice
formula for i. let b1, b2  u  b be suciently close to each other. choose a basis eb in
ih1(~h1(b1), zz). connect the points b1 and b2 with a path   u . the base eb1 can be
transported to ih1(~h1(), zz) by means of the gau-manin connection and it denes an
element ~  ih2(~h1(), ~h1(b1  b2); zz). then

~i(b2)  ~i(b1) =z~



2.1.

(p, q)  (i, )
suppose that we have two integrable systems {hk} and {h d

k } on the same symplectic

manifold m . in this situation we say that these two systems are dual to each other.

notice that this denition does not make duality an involution.

a pair of integrable systems given on one symplectic manifold (m, ) is called self-dual
k }, i.e., such

if there exists a symplectic involution  : m  m exchanging {hk} and {h d
that for any k = 1, . . . , n

hk = h d
k

once we have two integrable systems on the same manifold such that both collections

of hamiltonians constitute at least locally a coordinate system on the phase space m , one

can write down the equations of motion of the second integrable system in the second
order formalism using the action variables ii of the rst system as the coordinates qi for
the second.

the global version of this denition is: two hamiltonian systems are dual to each

other in the sense of action-coordinate (ac) duality if the action variables ii of the rst
system coincide with the coordinates qi of the second one and vice versa.

2.2.

i  i d
in the holomorphic algebraic category there is an interesting complication: the torus

has a complex dimension m and therefore ih1(tb; zz) = zz2m.

again, let b1, b2  u  b be suciently close to each other. choose a symplectic
basis eb1 = (a, b) in ih1(~h1(b1), zz) such that a  a = b  b = 0, a  b = 
,

7

where  is an intersection form ih1 zz ih1  zz. connect the points b1 and b2 with a path
  u . the base eb1 can be transported to ih1(~h1(), zz) by means of the gau-manin
connection and it denes an element ~  ih2(~h1(), ~h1(b1b2); zz). the (a, b)-splitting
of the basis eb1 is also transported transported via gau-manin along  and denes the
decomposition ~ = ~a + ~b,

~a,b  ih2(~h1(), ~h1(b1  b2); zz). then dene

~i(b2)  ~i(b1) =z~a



(2.5)

~i d(b2)  ~i d(b1) =z~b



we can take as the action variables the components of ~i. the reason for the b-cycles to be
discarded is simply the fact that the b-periods ~i d are not independent of the a-periods.
on the other hand, one can choose as the independent periods the integrals of  over any
lagrangian (in the sense of ) sublattice in ih1(tb; zz) transported along .

this leads to the following structure of the action variables in the holomorphic setting.

locally over a patch in b one chooses a basis in ih1 of the ber together with the set of
a-cycles. this choice may dier over another patch. over the intersection of these discs

one has a sp2m(zz) transformation relating the bases. altogether they form an sp2m(zz)
bundle. it is an easy excercise on the properties of the period matrix of abelian varieties

that the two form:

di i  di d

i

(2.6)

vanishes. therefore one can always locally nd a function f - prepotential, such that:

i d
i =

f
i i

(2.7)

this duality maps the integrable system to itself. it is called action-action (aa) dual-

ity.

2.3. quantum duality

there exists a clear quantum counterpart of this picture. consider the eigenvalue

problem for the schrodinger operators and the issue of the normalization of the wave-

functions.

the quantum integrable system is a complete collection of independent (in the
appropriate sense) commuting operators { hi}, i = 1, . . . , m, acting in the hilbert space

8

h of the model. by completeness we mean that these operators have simple common
spectrum u  irm.the commuting operators have common eigenfunctions. generically
the eigen-value problem:

hk|~i = ek()|~i

(2.8)

has the unique (up to normalization) solution. here ei is the corresponding eigenvalue
and ~ is a label, which takes values in some set . altogether, ek form an imbedding
e :   u

typically one has another set of commuting operators (position operators) { h d
k }
and the eigen-states |~xi with eigen-values ek(~x) in the hilbert space of the model are
represented as the appropriate functionals on the space of the eigen-values of the operators
h d
k . here ~x is another label, which takes values in the set d, which is mapped by ed

to u d  irm. the familiar case is m = t m, hm = l2(m), the operators hi are
represented as commuting dierential operators, and h d
k are represented as operators of
multiplication by a function ed
i (~x). suppose that we are given two classically ac dual
hamiltonian systems. let ii and i d
i are the
coordinates for the rst system). assume that there exist quantum integrals of motion for
both systems. let us denote by ii the quantum integrals of motion of the rst system and
by i d
i

i be their action variables (recall that i d

the quantum integrals of motion of the second one.

once we have a quantum integrable system we can identify h with the space l2()
of square integrable functions on  (w.r.t. the spectral measure d). indeed, choose a
basis in h consisting of the common eigenvectors (2.8) |~i, where ~ = {1, . . . , m}  .
then for any |i  h one can associate the function h~|i on . of course this mapping
h  l2() depends on the normalization of the eigenvectors we have chosen.

in particular any operator a acting on h can be expressed as an operator acting on

l2() as

a : (~) 7zh~|a|~i(~)d(~)

now suppose that we have two integrable systems h1, . . . , hn and h d
n on the
same hilbert space h. we can use the rst one to identify the hilbert space with the
space of functions on its spectrum l2() and write down the operators of the second

1 , . . . , h d

integrable system as acting on these functions and not on some abstract hilbert space
vectors. consider the function h~|~di  l2()  l2(d) = l2(  d), where |~i and

9

| ~di are the eigenvectors of the rst and the second integrable system respectively. this

function by denition satises for any k = 1, . . . , m the following equations:

i |~ih~|~did(~) = ed

zh~| h d
i (d)h~|~di
zdh~|~dih~d| hi|~did(d) = ei()h~|~di

(2.9)

we see that the function h~|~di turns out to be an eigenfunction for two commuting set of
operators acting on two groups of variables. otherwise the function h~|~di is not uniquely
dened by the two dual integrable systems since the arbitrary change of the normalizations
of the eigenvectors |~i 7 f (~)|~i and |~di 7 f d(~d)|~di results in

h~|~di 7 f (~)f d(~d)h~|~di

note also that though we have written the equations (2.9) as integral equation with

the kernel being a generalized function for particular dual systems these equations may be

dierential or dierence ones. (in fact it happens in examples considered in the sequel.)
analogously to the classical case a pair of quantum integrable systems {hi} and
i } is called self-dual if there exists a unitary involution  : h  h exchanging the two

{h d
collections of operators, i.e. such that for any k = 1, . . . , m

  hk = h d

k  

though the two integrable systems of a self-dual pair are completely equivalent, the corre-
sponding function h~|~di does not necessarily satisfy the condition h~|~di = h~d|~i. one
can make it obey this equation after a suitable normalization of the eigenvector bases.

in some cases it is natural to choose  among the action variables of the classical

integrable system.

3. examples of dual systems. one degree of freedom:

in this section we work out explicitly a few examples of the dual systems.

10

3.1. classical systems

two-particle systems which we are going to consider reduce (after exclusion of the

center of mass motion) to a one-dimensional problem. the action-angle variables can be

written explicitly and the dual system emerges immediately once the natural hamiltonians

are chosen. the problem is the following. suppose the phase space is coordinatized by

(p, q). the dual hamiltonian (in the sense of ac duality) is a function of q expressed in

terms of i, , where i,  are the action-angle variables of the original system : hd(i, ) =

hd(q). in all the cases below there is a natural choice of hd(q).

general
way that the coecients g2 and g3 are the sections of the line bundles o(4n) and o(6n)

which is a section of o(12n). the latter has generically 12n zeroes. to make the total
space of bration isomorphic to the k3 surface (compact simply-connected symplectic

surface) we need 24 singular bers, i.e. n = 2. the hamiltonian of the integrable system

we consider is any function on b. it gives rise to a meromorphic vector eld on m , which

linearizes along the elliptic bers. the symplectic form is given by:

over a simply connected region u  ip1\1(0) one can trivialize the bundle of the
rst homologies ih1(ez, zz), in particular to make a well-dened choice of the a-cycle of
the elliptic bre. the local action variable i = i(z) is dened over u by the equation:

(3.30)

where the integral is taken over a chosen a-cycle. the bration of ih1(ez, zz) over
b\1(0) is non-trivial and there is no global monodromy invariant choice of a-cycles.
so the action variable is dened by (3.30) only locally. the monodromies around the de-

generate bers corresponding to various singularities has been worked out by kodaira and

their physical interpretation can be found in [40]. for generic polynomials g2(z), g3(z) the
singularities are of the type a1.

moral of

the

story. the moral of the previous discussion is that the polynomial de-

pendence on momenta of the hamiltonian is traded with the rational potential of the

dual system. the trigonometric potential is mapped to the trigonometric (= relativis-

tic) dependence on momenta of dual system. the elliptic potential gives rise to elliptic

(=double-relativistic ) dependence on momentum of the dual system hamiltonian. when

the system with trigonometric dependence on momentum is quantized its hamiltonian be-

comes a nite- dierence operator. the wave-functions become the functions of the discrete

variables. the origin of this is in the bohr-sommerfeld quantization condition. indeed,

since the trigonometric dependence of momenta implies that the leaves of the polarization

are compact and moreover non-simply connected the covariantly constant sections of the

prequantization connection along the polarization ber generically seases to exist. it is

only for special quantized values of the action variables that the section exists. in the

elliptic case the quantum dual hamiltonian is going to be a dierence operator of the in-

nite order. the self-dual elliptic many-body system is still to be constructed. it seems that

to achieve this goal one needs a notion of the heisenberg double for the central extension

of the two dimensional current group [43].

the prepotential. to illustrate the meaning of the aa duality we look at

example of
the two-body system, relevant for the su (2) n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory [16]:

h =

p2
2

+ 2 cos(q)

(3.43)

with 2 being a complex number - the coupling constant of a two-body problem and at the

same time a dynamically generated scale of the gauge theory. the action variable is given

18

by one of the periods of the dierential pdq. let us introduce more notations: x = cos(q),
y = p sin(q)

a level set of the hamiltonian can be written as follows:

y2 = (x  u)(x2  1)

i

i d(cid:19) = 0

which can be used to write down an asymptotic expansion of the action variable near
u =  or u = 1 as well as that of prepotential (2.7). the aa duality is manifested
in the fact that near u =  (which corresponds to the high energy scattering in the
two-body problem and also a perturbative regime of su (2) gauge theory) the appropriate
action variable is i (it experiences a monodromy i  i as u goes around ), while near
u = 1 (which corresponds to the dynamics of the two-body system near the top of the
potential and to the strongly coupled su (2) gauge theory) the appropriate variable is i d

(which corresponds to a weakly coupled magnetic u (1) gauge theory and is actually well

dened near u = 1 point) [12]. the monodromy invariant combination of the periods [44]:

ii d  2f = u

(whose origin is in the periods of calabi-yau manifolds on the one hand and in the proper-

ties of anomaly in theory on the other) can be chosen as a global coordinate on the space
of integrals of motion b. at u   the prepotential has an expansion of the form:

to derive the recurrence relation for the oscillator wave-functions we use the creation
operator representation: n = 12n
( + )n. applying this relation twice and using
the fact that n is an eigen-function of h one arrives at (3.36). for the sutherland model
we use two obvious relations:

(x  y)xz = yyz

(1  2xy + y2)yz = (x  y)z

4. duality in many-body systems:

in the previous sections we discussed the concepts of duality and worked out explicitly

several examples of dual two-body systems in both classical and quantum cases. we now

turn to a study of many-body systems. the many-body systems can be divided into

three classes: rational, trigonometric and elliptic ones. the hamiltonian of the model

may depend on momenta/coordinates in any one of these three fashions. the duality

transformation exchanges them.

4.1. examples.

we summarize the systems and their duals in the following table:

schneider [48][49][50][51][52]. the parameters r and  here are the radius of the circle

the coordinates of the particles take values in and the inverse speed of light respectively.

the horizontal arrows in this table are the dualities, relating the systems on the both

sides. most of them were discussed by simon ruijsenaars [52],[49]. we notice that the

duality transformations form a group which in the case of self-dual systems listed here

contains sl2(zz). the generator s is the gorizontal arrow described below, while the t

generator is in fact a certain nite time evolution of the original system (which is always

a symplectomorphism, which maps the integrable system to the dual one). we begin with
recalling the hamiltonians of these systems. throughout this section qij denotes qi  qj.

4.2. explanations: hamiltonian and/or poisson reduction

suppose we are given a symplectic manifold (x, x) with the hamiltonian action of
a lie group g with equivariant moment map  : x  g. the symplectic quotient of x
with respect to g is the symplectic manifold m , denoted as x//g and dened as:

m = 1(0)/g

23

its symplectic form m is dened through the relation:

pm = ix

where p : 1(0)  m is the projection and i : 1(0)  x is the inclusion.

let us assume that an integrable hamiltonian system is dened on x. let k =
{k1, . . . , kx}, x = 1
2 dimx denote the set of its integrals of motion. suppose that this
system is equivariant with respect to the action of g. this is equivalent to the statement,
that ki and a form a closed algebra k with respect to the poisson brackets. let us
assume that on the zero level of the moment map  the center z(k) of the algebra k is
suciently big, i.e. the dimension of its spectrum equals half the dimension of m . then
the integrable system on x descends to the integrable system on m , k being replaced by
z(k).

now let us impose one further restriction. suppose that x possesses another g-
equivariant integrable hamiltonian system, with integrals q = {q1, . . . , qx}, which is
dual to the system k (algebraically it means that k and q generate all functions on x).
we also assume that q descends to m .

on the original manifold x the evolution of the system k looks non-trivially in the
action-angle variables for the system q and vice versa. the same is true for the reduced
systems. the advantage of the consideration of x is that the systems on x can be much

simpler then those on m . in the following sections we shall consider various examples of

this situation.

the similar statements hold in the case of poisson manifolds, the relevant reduction

being the poisson one (one rst takes a quotient with respect to the group and then picks

out a symplectic leaf). we leave the details to the interested readers.

now we proceed to the explicit constructions. we will discuss the models introduced

in the previous section on case-by-case basis and show how the reduction which yields

these systems also explains the dualities between dierent systems.

rational cm model. this model can be obtained as a result of hamiltonian reduction
applied to t go [53] for g = su(n ), o = cipn1. the symplectic form on this manifold
is the sum of liouville form on t g and n  fubini-study form on o. let (e1 : . . . : en )
be the homogeneous coordinates on o. the group g = su (n ) acts on t g via conjugation
and on o in a standard way (o = g/h, h = s(u (n  1)  u (1))). then the moment
map for the action of g on t g  o is

 = adq(p )  j jij = (n ij  eiej )

(4.12)

24

where q  g, p  g. now we choose two sets of hamiltonians:

hk =

1
k

trp k

and h d

k =

1
k

trqk

if we identify g and g with the help of tr then the equation  = 0 has the form:

[p, q] = j

(4.13)

(4.14)

which is obviously preserved by the involution: p  q, q  p . so we are guaranteed
to get a self-dual system. now we have to nd suitable coordinates and action variables.

let us choose the gauge (remember that we have to mod out (4.14) by the action of g):

q = diag(q1, . . . , qn )

(4.15)

this gauge is preserved by the action of the maximal torus t = u (1)n1 which turns out
to be sucient to set all ei to be equal: ei = 1 [54]. then the equation (4.14) xes p
which turns out to be nothing but l in (4.2). as it is obvious that the reduced symplectic

form equalspi dpi  dqi (with the constraintp qi =p pi = 0) one concludes that qis are

the action variables for the system generated by h d

k s. therefore eigenvalues of p are the

action variables for the ows generated by hks. we therefore proved the following
statement. consider the map:

 : {(pi, qi)}  {(i, i)}

(4.16)

where is are the eigenvalues of l  p and i are the diagonal entries of q in the
eigenbasis of p . it is an involution.

let us go back to the systems (4.13). the moment map equation (4.14) is obviously

preserved by the transformations of the form

(p, q) 7 (ap + bq, cp + dq) ad  bc = 1

(4.17)

which form sl2(ir) group. the transformed hamiltonians

g  hk =

1
k

tr(ap + bq)k

are easy to express through the original hamiltonians (4.13) in the coordinates (pi, qi):

g  hk(pi, qi)| = hk(api + bqi, qi)|a

25

let us restrict our attention to the sl2(zz) subgroup of the group (4.17). it is generated

by the transformations

s =(cid:18) 0 1

0 (cid:19) t =(cid:18) 1

1

1

1(cid:19)

(4.18)

it is clear that s coincides with the involution leading to (4.16) while t is the unit time
evolution with respect to the hamiltonian h d
2 .

trigonometric cm, rational rs. the trigonometric cm system can be obtained as
hamiltonian reduction applied to either t g  o [53] or t g  o [55] where g is the
central extension of the loop algebra. in the latter case one has to specify the action of
the gauge group lg on the orbit o. the correct choice is the most natural one: since the
orbit is nite-dimensional, the only sensible way the loop group can act on it is through
the evaluation at some point. the elements of t  g of our interest are the pairs:

p (x), kx + q(x)

(4.19)

where k is a xed number, p (x) is a g-valued function on a circle s1 and q(x) is a gauge

eld on a circle. the phase space is acted on by the gauge group:

p (x) 7 g(x)1p (x)g(x), q(x) 7 g(x)1q(x)g(x) + kg1(x)xg(x)

(4.20)

the moment equation has the form:

kxp + [q, p ] = j(x)

(4.21)

where j is the one from (4.12). the number k can be rescaled by the choice of the radius
of a circle s1. instead we choose the circle of unit radius and keep k. to solve the equation

(4.21) we x a gauge (4.20). we can either decide that q is a constant diagonal matrix

q = diag(q1, . . . , qn )

and then the solution for p (x) will produce the lax operator (4.4) of the sutherland model
with r = 2

k [55],[56].

it is quite amusing that the same reduction yields the rational rs model as well. in

order to see that choose the gauge

p (x) = diag (p1 (x) , . . . , pn (x))

(4.22)

26

then the moment equation (4.21) implies that q(x) is diagonal everywhere except x = 0

where it has an o-diagonal part proportional to the delta-function. at the same time

p (x) is forced to be constant pi(x) = qi.

q(x)ij = i(x)ij + (x)

i

qi  qj

(4.23)

the natural candidate for a hamiltonian in this setting would be a gauge invariant function

of q(x). since q(x) is actually a gauge eld the gauge invariant function is a trace in some

representation r of a wilson loop:

hr = trrp expi 1

k

q(x)dx

(4.24)

which is easy to evaluate provided we assume the following structure of the diagonal piece

of q(x) (which supported by the alternative derivation of the solution to the moment

equation below):

i(x) = i(x) + (x)xk6=i

i

qk  qi

which makes the wilson loop

it is shown in the appendix (in the trigonometric case from which this one follows as

trigonometric cm model. there are three dierent

approaches, all leading to the same nite-dimensional hamitlonian system. there are two

27

hamiltonian reductions and one poisson reduction. the advantage of hamiltonian one is

the simplicity and geometric clarity. the advantage of poisson one is nite-dimensionality

at each step and considerable simplicity of the proof of the canonical commutation relations.

we try to outline all three approaches with the emphasis on the poisson reduction, as the

relevant hamiltonian reduction was described in some details in [56]. we keep in mind a

sequence of contractions:

at2  t  g  g  g

(4.27)

where the rst entry is the space of g-valued gauge elds on a two-torus t2, the second

entry is the cotangent bundle to the central extension of the loop group lg and the last

one is the space of lattice (for the simplest graph, representing a two-torus) connections,

described below.
hamiltonian approach. consider the space at2 of su (n ) gauge elds a on a two-torus
t2 = s1  s1. let the circumferences of the circles be r and . the space at2 is acted
on by a gauge group g , which preserves a symplectic form

 =

(4.28)

k

42z tra  a,

with k being an arbitrary real number for now. the gauge group acts via evaluation at some
point p  t2 on any coadjoint orbit o of g, in particular, on o = cipn1. let cipn1
have a n  fubini-study symplectic form. let (e1 : . . . : en ) be the homogeneous
coordinates on o. then the moment map for the action of g on at2  o is

kfa + j2(p),

jij = i(ij  eiej )

(4.29)

fa being the curvature two-form. here we think of ei as being the coordinates on cn

constrained so that pi |ei|2 = n and considered up to the multiplication by a common

phase factor.

let us provide a certain amount of commuting hamiltonians. obviously, the eigen-
values of the monodromy of a along any xed loop on t2 commute with themselves. we
consider the reduction at the zero level of the moment map. we have at least n  1
functionally independent commuting functions on the reduced phase space m.

let us estimate the dimension of m . if  = 0 then the moment equation forces the
connection to be at and therefore its gauge orbits are parameterized by the conjugacy
classes of the monodromies around two non-contractible cycles on t2: a and b. since
the fundamental group 1(t2) of t2 is abelian a and b are to commute. hence they are

28

simultaneously diagonalizable, which makes m0 a 2(n  1) dimensional manifold. notice
that the generic point on the quotient space has a non-trivial stabilizer, isomorphic to the
maximal torus t of su (n ). now, in the presence of o the moment equation implies that
the connection a is at outside of p and has a non-trivial monodromy around p. thus:

aba1b1 = exp(rj)

(4.30)

(the factor r comes from the normalization of the delta-function in (4.29)). if we diago-

nalize a, then b is uniquely reconstructed up to the right multiplication by the elements

of t . the potential degrees of freedom in j are eaten up by the former stabilizer t of a
at connection: if we conjugate both a and b by an element t  t then j gets conjugated.
now, it is important that o has dimension 2(n  1). the reduction of o with respect to t
consists of a point and does not contribute to the dimension of m. thereby we expect to
get an integrable system. without doing any computations we already know that we get a

pair of dual systems. indeed, we may choose as the set of coordinates the eigen-values of a

or the eigen-values of b. the logarithms of the eigen-values of b are the action variables
for the system generated by trbk, and vice versa.

the two-dimensional picture has the advantage that the geometry of the problem

suggests the sl2(zz)-like duality. consider the operations s and t realized as:

s : (a, b) 7 (aba1, a1); t : (a, b) 7 (a, ba)

(4.31)

which correspond to the freedom of choice of generators in the fundamental group of a two-
torus. notice that both s and t preserve the commutator aba1b1 and commute with
the action of the gauge group. the group  generated by s and t (it is a subrogup of the

group outfree(2) of the outer authomorphismes of the free group with two generators)
seems to be larger then sl2(zz). however in the limit , r  0 it contracts to sl2(zz) in
a sense that we get the transformations (4.18) by expanding

a = 1 + p + . . . , b = 1 + rq + . . .

for r,   0.

the disadvantage of the two-dimensional picture us the necessity to keep too many

redundant degrees of freedom. the rst of the contractions (4.27) actually allows to replace

the space of two dimensional gauge elds by the cotangent space to the (central extension

of) loop group:

t  g = {(g(x), kx + p (x))}

29

which is a deformation of the phase space of the previous example (q(x) got promoted

to a group-valued eld). the relation to the two dimensional construction is the following.
choose a non-contractible circle s1 on the two-torus which does not pass through the

marked point p. let x, y be the coordinates on the torus and y = 0 is the equation of the
s1. the periodicity of x is  and that of y is r. then

p (x) = ax(x, 0), g(x) = p expz r

0

ay(x, y)dy.

the gauge transformations on s1 transform on (g(x), p (x)) is a way, similar to (4.20).

the moment map equation (4.29) goes over to the moment map equation [56]:

kg1xg + g1p g  p = j(x),

(4.32)

with k = 1

r . the solution of this equation in the gauge p = diag(q1, . . . , qn ) leads to the
lax operator a = g(0) of the form (4.11) with r,  exchanged [56]. on the other hand, if

we follow (4.22) and diagonalize g(x):

then a similar calculation leads to the lax operator

k

g(x) = diag(cid:0)z1 = eirq1 , . . . , zn = eirqn(cid:1)
b = p expi 1

poisson description. here we introduce a set of commuting functions on the space of

graph connection on a graph, corresponding to a moduli space of at connections on a

torus with one hole and describe the ow generated by this set. being reduced to a

particular symplectic leaf of the moduli space of at connections on the torus , this set

of functions turns out to be a full set of commuting hamiltonians. we introduce another

full set of commuting variables and write down the hamiltonians taking the latter set as

a set of coordinates thus recovering the ruijsenaars integrable system. consider a graph,

consisting of two edges and one vertex with the fat graph structure corresponding to a
punctured torus [57]. the space of graph connections al for such graph is just a product

30

of two copies of the group g: al = g  g = {(a, b)|a, b  g}, where a and b are
assigned to the edges of the graph. for a choice of ciliation on al the poisson bracket on
al is given by the relations, following from the general rules [57].

{a, a} = raa  a + a  ara  2(a  1)ra(1  a)
{b, b} = rab  b + b  bra  2(b  1)ra(1  b)
{a, b} = r(a  b) + a  br + (1  b)r21(a  1)  (a  1)r(1  b),

(4.34)

where ra = 1

2 (r  r21).

now let us restrict ourselves to the case g = sln and the standard r-matrix:

r =x>0

e  e +

2xi

hi  hi,

ra =

2x>0

e  e

(4.35)

in this case one can easily derive the following commutaion relations

{tran, a} = 0 {trbn, b} = 0

{tran, b} = n(an)0

{trbn, a} = na(bn)0

(4.36)

(4.37)

where (x)0 denotes the traceless part of the matrix x. therefore, the functions trbn for
n = 1 . . . n  1 considered as hamiltonians generate commuting ows on al.

b (t1, . . . , tn1) = b (0, . . . , 0)

a (t1, . . . , tn1) = a (0, . . . , 0) e(cid:0)t1b++tn 1bn 1(cid:1)0

(4.38)

as it was shown in [57] the lattice gauge group gl acts on gl in a poisson way, and the
quotient poisson manifold coincides with the moduli space m of smooth at connection on
the riemann surface, corresponding to the fat graph l. in our case the group gl is g itself
(for the graph has just one vertex) which acts on a and b by simultaneous conjugation.

g : (a, b) 7 (gag1, gbg1).

(4.39)

the functions trak and trbk are invariant under this action, and therefore their
pull-downs on the moduli space m generate commuting ows there, which trajectories are
just projections of (4.38).

however the moduli space m in our case is a poisson manifold with degenerate poisson
bracket. the casimir functions of this poisson structure are the functions of conjugacy

pulled down to m.

in our case such casimir functions are tr(cid:0)aba1b1(cid:1)k

dierent symplectic leaves have dierent dimensions and the lowest dimension of them
is 2(n  1). these leaves correspond to the monodromy around the hole conjugated to a
matrix

,

eir id + p,

rkp  1,  is a numerical constant from the previous section parameterizing the set of
symplectic leaves of lowest dimension. let t = eir . on the leaf m the family of
functions trak, k = 1, . . . , n  1 forms a full set of poisson-commuting variables.

introduce local coordinates on these symplectic leaves in the following way. let
z1 = eirq1 , . . . , zn = eirqn be the eigenvalues of the operator a and 1, . . . , n are
the corresponding diagonal matrix elements of b (in the basis, diagonalizing a). one can

check that in this basis

j = ij
bi

(1  t)
zi/zj  t

.

(4.40)

the functions zi and j are well-dened locally on the symplectic leaf m. their poisson
brackets are equal to:

{zi, zj} = 0
{i, j} = ij
{zi, j} = ziji,j.

(zi + zj )

(zi/zj  t)(zj/zi  t)(zi  zj)

i 6= j

(4.41)

to dene the variables, canonically conjugated to zi we can just multiply i by factors

independent on i. for example one can take:

si = it

n 1

2 yk,k6=is (zk  zi)(zi  zk)

(zk  tzi)(zi  tzk)

one can check, that these new variables si have the poisson brackets

{si, sj} = 0

{zi, sj} = zisji,j.

substituting this back to the formula (4.40) we get:

revisited. we have seen in all the previous examples that the origin of the dual

system is connected with the existence of transversal g-invariant foliations on the original

space, which become lagrangian foliations when pulled down to the quotient. the sim-

plicity of the operating with dual systems in the advocated framework in the classical case

allows one to hope that the duality can systematically elevated to the quantum case as

well. see [58][34].

4.3. appendix. computation of the poisson brackets

the bivector dening the poisson structure on al can be rewritten in the form

where (i, j) is 1, 0 or 1 depending on whether i is less, equal or greater than j respectively

are the standard gln generators acting on the u-th end of the edge. (in our
case ei(1)
acts on a from the left, ei(2)
acts on a from the

it is not convenient to compute the poisson brackets between zi and j using this
bivector directly, for it does not preserve the diagonality of the matrix a. however, to

compute the poisson brackets of the gauge invariant functions we are allowed to add to
j  x
, where x is an arbitrary vector eld. using this and also the fact that

a simple contour integral calculation shows that

the rest follows by expanding near  = 0. if one performs an expansion near r = 0 one

gets the statement that the rational lax operator (4.8) is conjugated to the operator of

the form announced in (4.25).

it is amusing that the expression 1

5. gauge theories and duality in integrable systems

5.1. old approach: many-body systems as low-dimensional gauge theories

it is a fruitful approach to think of the many-body system as of the gauge theory of

a certain kind. namely, the particles of the model can be identied (sometimes) with the

eigenvalues of the wilson loops in the theory and the gauge dynamics becomes a dynamics

of the particles. of course, in the real four dimensional world the gauge eld has innitely

many degrees of freedom and we dont expect to see any tractable quantum mechanical

system unless we have a principle which allows us to restrict the dynamical problem to

a nite number of degrees of freedom. the simplest case is the case of low-dimensional

gauge theory, where the gauge eld simply doesnt have propagating degrees of freedom.

consider, for example, two dimensional yang-mills theory with a gauge group g = u (n ).

when formulated on a circle of radius r in the hamiltonian formalism the theory has as

a phase space the space of gauge elds a(x) on the circle and their duals - chromoelectric

elds e(x). the gauge group acts on (e, a) as follows:

(e, a)  (g1eg, g1xg + g1ag)

(5.1)

leading to the gauss law xe + [a, e], which is nothing but the moment map from the
section 4.2. we can go to the gauge where a is a constant (w.r.t. x) diagonal matrix

a = diag(q1, . . . , qn )

(5.2)

here are our particles. the time evolution makes qi to move and depending on the cir-
cumstances such as the presence of the sources like j (which correspond to the time-like

wilson lines) one gets the hamiltionian system of the kind we described and studied.
the large gauge transformations shift qis by integer multiples of 1
r making them live
1
2r . one can get more complicated examples by deforming the
on a circle of radius
model as follows. replace s1 by t2, e by the second component of the gauge eld

along the torus, the symplectic form beingrt2 tra  a. then the gauss law becomes

fa = xay  yax + [ax, ay]. setting it to zero allows to diagonalize ax, ay simultane-
ously:

(cid:18) ax
ay(cid:19) = diag(cid:18)(cid:18) p1

q1(cid:19) , . . . ,(cid:18) pn
qn(cid:19)(cid:19)

(5.3)

here, xi and yi do not poisson-commute, although both live on circle. one gets, therefore
, the speed of
a system of relativistic partcles on a circle. the radius of the circle is

1

2rx

37

light is ry. the gauge theory this model corresponds to is known as chern-simons theory
on a torus (perhaps with punctures).

one can go higher in dimensions with some care. for example, by considering super-
symmetric n = 2 theory in d = 4 with compact space m 3 one gets a quantum mechanics
on the moduli space of monopoles in ir3.

5.2. new approach: many-body systems in supersymmetric gauge theories

recent progress in the understanding of non-perturbative phenomena emerged after
the work of seiberg and witten on four dimensional n = 2 sym [12] and works of seiberg
and his collaborators on n = 1 d = 4 theories. the major tool in these studies is the
low energy eective lagrangian which is constrained by two priniciples - the holomorphy

of chiral objects and electric-magnetic duality. it is the electric-magnetic duality which

makes the integrable systems to appear in the solutions to the gauge theories.

in particular, one can argue on the general grounds [18] that any n = 2 supersym-
metric gauge theory in four dimensions corresponds to a certain integrable system in the

holomorphic sense. the point is that the coulomb branch of the theory parameterizes

the family of abelian varieties (whose period matrix coincides with the matrix of coupling

constants of the eective low-energy abelian theory). moreover the total space must carry

a holomorphic symplectic form , whose integral along the cycle in the ber gives rise to
a derivative of the central charge of a bp s representation of n = 2 susy algebra along
the base. moreover the abelian varieties must be lagrangian with respect to .

the integrable systems corresponding to a large number of eld theories are identied.

in particular, the low-energy theory of the pure n = 2 su (nc) sym is governed by
the anc1 periodic (or ane) toda system. the n = 2 theory with a massive adjoint
hypermultiplet corresponds to the elliptic calogero-moser system, where the mass (which
is naturally a complex parameter in the n = 2 theory) is identied with the coupling
constant. the theory is uv nite (in fact, it is softly broken n = 4 theory) and therefore
has as another modulus  the ultra-violet coupling  which enters the integrable model as

the modulus of the curve. another theories which were mentioned so far are the relativistic

generalizations of those two. these correspond to ve dimensional gauge theories with the

same number of supercharges, compactied on a circle of a nite radius r. the speed of
light of the relativistic model is proportional to the inverse radius 1
r of the circle. for the
theories with fundamental matter the rm identication with the integrable systems has

been made in four [28][60] as well as in ve and six dimensions [60].

38

in some cases the dualities suggested by the integrable systems are not obvious on

the eld theory side. we plan to return to more detailed treatment of these cases (which

involve six dimensional theories) in the future.

5.3. dualities in eld theories vs. dualities in many-body systems

in the

dualities
old approach. let us start with the two-dimensional yang-mills the-
ory with the gauge coupling g2 formulated on a riemann surface of area a. it was shown
by e. witten in [61] that the perturbative in g2a part of the correlation functions in this

(non-supersymmetric) theory coincides with the correlation functions of certain observables
in twisted n = 2 supersymmetric two-dimensional yang-mills theory.

among the twisted supercharges of the latter theory one nds a scalar q which annihi-

lates the complex scalar  in the vector multiplet. the observables constructed out of the

gauge invariant functions of  and their descendants can be mapped to certain observables

in non-supersymmetric theory.

as we discussed above, when yang-mills theory is formulated on a cylinder with the

insertion of an appropriate time-like wilson line, it is equivalent to the sutherland model
describing a collection of n particles on a circle. the observables trk of the previous

paragraph are precisely the integrals of motion of this system.

one can look at other supercharges as well. in particular, when the theory is for-

mulated on a cylinder there is another class of observables annihilated by a supercharge.

one can arrange the combination of supercharges which will annihilate the wilson loop

operator. by repeating the procedure similar to the one in [61] one arrives at the quantum

mechanical theory whose hamiltonians are generated by the spatial wilson loops. this

model is nothing but the rational ruijsenaars-schneider many-body system.

the duality between these two systems is a consequence of the fact that when lifted
to the supersymmetric model both eld theories become equivalent to the same n = 2
super-yang-mills theory in two dimensions.

the self-duality of trigonometric ruijsenaars system has even more transparent physi-

cal meaning. namely, the eld theory whose quantum mechanical avatar is the ruijsenaars
system is three dimensional chern-simons theory on t2  r1 with the insertion of an ap-
propriate temporal wilson line and spatial wilson loop. it is the freedom to place the

latter which leads to several equivalent theories. the group of (self-)dualities of this model

is very big and is generated by the transformations s and t (4.31).

39

in short, the duality reveals here itself as a consequence of lorentz invariance of the

underlying eld theory.

duality in the new approach. the new approach deals with supersymmetric gauge

theories in three, four, ve and six dimensions. perhaps the richest case is the six dimen-
sional theory compactied on a three dimensional torus t3 down to three dimensions.

as was discussed extensively in [15] in case where two out of three radii of t3 are much

smaller then the third one r the eective three dimensional theory is a sigma model with
the target space x being the hyper-kahler manifold (in particular, holomorphic symplectic)
which is a total space of algebraic integrable system. the complex structure in which x is
the algebraic integrable system is independent of the radius r while the kahler structure

depends on r in such a way that the kahler class of the abelian ber is proportional to

1/r.

the duality of the integrable systems shows up in the gauge theories in the several

ways.

first of all aa duality the well-known phenomenon in the four dimensional n = 2
gauge theory which was observed and exploited in [12] and then later on in the plenty of

works. the low-energy eective theory has dierent sets of relevant degrees of freedom

over dierent regions of the moduli space of vacua. the transformations between dier-

ent descriptions go through the electric-magnetic duality on the gauge eld side which is

accompanied by supersymmetry by a aa-type duality on the scalar side. although this

duality is connected with the electric-magnetic symmetry which is not realized geometri-

cally in four dimensions, it does become geometric when the theory is lifted to a tensor

theory in six dimensions [62].

the duality of the ac type is also present and is rather interesting. as one varies the
moduli of t3 the geometry of x varies as well. in particular, dierent four dimensional
theories can ow to the same three dimensional theory. this is where the ac duality in

the integrable systems shows up.

for example, a certain scaling limit of the ve dimensional su (n ) theory with massive

adjoint hypermultiplet, compactied on a circle seems to be equivalent/dual to four di-

mensional su (n ) theory with massive adjoint hypermultiplet when instanton corrections

are turned o in both theories.

the theory in three dimensions which came from four dimensions upon a compact-

ication on a circle whose low-energy eective action describes only abelian degrees of

40

freedom can be always dualized to the theory of scalars/spinors only, due to the vector-

scalar duality in three dimensions. in this way dierent sets of vector and hypermultiplets

in four dimensions can lead to the same three dimensional theory (one of the examples of

such symmetries is provided by the three dimensional mirror symmetry [63][64]).

one can also use the ac duality to establish the following fact. consider two ac dual
integrable systems. consider three dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory whose
higgs branch is x - the phase space of these systems. then two n = 2 supersymmetric
theories whose spaces of scalars are both x but the superpotentials are taken from the
sets of hamiltonians of the rst and the second systems respectively are dual to each other

in the sense that both ow in the uv/ir (depending on the whether these hamiltonians

correspond to the relevant or irrelevant operators) to the same theory.

we are certain that there are more applications of the notion of duality in integrable

systems both in the theory of integrability itself and in the physics, gauge theories being

the arena for the most immediate ones.
