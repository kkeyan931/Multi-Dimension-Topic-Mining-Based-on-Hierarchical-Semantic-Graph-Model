abstract

we investigate the collapse of a spherical shell of matter in an anti-de
sitter space. we search for a holographic description of the collapsing shell in
the boundary theory. it turns out that in the boundary theory it is possible
to nd information about the radial size of the shell. the shell deforms the
background spacetime, and the deformed background metric enters into the
action of a generic bulk eld. as a consequence, the correlators of operators
coupling to the bulk eld are modied. by studying the analytic structure
of the correlators, we nd that in the boundary theory there are unstable
excitations (shellons) whose masses are multiples of a scale set by the radius
of the shell. we also comment on the relation between black hole formation
in the bulk and thermalization in the boundary.

1 introduction

one of the many [1] exciting aspects of the ads/cft correspondence [2, 3, 4] is
that it contains the seeds for solving the black hole information puzzle [5] in a
holographic [6, 7] way. so far, the understanding of black holes in the context of the
ads/cft correspondence is mostly limited to the properties of static solutions. for
example, one can give a boundary theory interpretation for the bekenstein-hawking
entropy [8, 9], properties of dierent vacua and their thermodynamic interpretation
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. however, the static solutions have some rather special
features, such as the appearance of multiple asymptotic regions4. to address the
issue of the fate of information, one would like to study black holes which form from
collapsing or colliding matter5, and their subsequent evolution to the end. these
issues are much less clear as discussed in [20]. in this paper we take a rst step
towards understanding the collapse of a spherical shell of matter in ads space.

the rst problem to confront is how to account for the presence of a shell of
matter in the bulk of an ads space. in particular, how does one obtain information
about the radial size of a shell? for a pointlike probe, the scale-radius duality
[21, 22, 12, 23] converts its radial distance in the bulk into a transverse scale of its
image at the boundary. however, in the case of a shell, the radial scale is a bit
trickier to nd because of spherical symmetry. what is the holographic image of a
shell at the boundary? since a pure ads space corresponds to a vacuum state in
the boundary, and the end result of the shell collapse (if it is a stable black hole
with positive specic heat) corresponds to a boundary theory at nite temperature
[4, 24], a rst guess is that adding a shell to the ads space corresponds to an
o-equilibrium conguration in the boundary theory, which then evolves towards
thermal equilibrium as the shell collapses to a black hole in the bulk (see e.g. [12, 25]
for discussion). further, the scale-radius duality of the ads/cft would suggest that
the initial conguration is somehow peaked at higher energies than the temperature
of the black hole. in other words, one might hope to associate an initial average
occupation number spectrum with the initial conguration, with a peak at energies
corresponding to the initial radius of the shell, and study how the time evolution
rearranges the spectrum to a thermal one, with the peak moving down in energies
to stabilize at the hawking temperature.

to test the above idea, one would need some way of detecting or computing
e.g. the average occupation number spectrum in the boundary theory. one would
then need to study operators which have access to the excited states. for example,

4however, see [16].
5black hole creation in ads3 has been studied in [17, 18, 19]. in these cases the resulting black

holes are stable.

the shell deforms the background spacetime, and the deformation couples to the
stress-energy tensor of the boundary theory, giving it an expectation value. the
expectation value gives information only about the total energy, not about the details
of the distribution. however, one could study higher n-point correlators of the stress
tensor; these involve more detailed information about the spectrum which one can
then try to extract out6.

another, more direct, way to detect the shell would be to assemble it from matter
associated with a bulk eld coupling to an operator oshell in the boundary. then,
the n-point functions of oshell would provide information of the shell itself, without
a detour to its backreaction to the metric. however, this route obviously depends
on what the shell is made of and how.

in this paper, we shall follow a third possible strategy. since the shell deforms the
background spacetime, the action for any bulk eld in the deformed background is
modied as well. since the bulk action is the generating function for the correlation
functions of the corresponding operators in the boundary theory, the correlation
functions will reect the presence of the shell. even if the expectation values of
the operators (the one point functions) vanish, the 2-point functions can be dier-
ent from those evaluated in the vacuum. for example, in the end of the collapse,
when the boundary theory thermalizes, a two-point function will become periodic
in imaginary time, even if the operator has a zero expectation value in the thermal
background. so our strategy is that we shall not try to directly probe the states
associated to the shell, but we investigate their eect on other operators in the
boundary theory, and use their correlation functions to obtain information about
the shell. a related possibility would be to study the properties of a hanging string
[26, 27, 28, 29]. in the case of a black hole the boundary theory will be at nite
temperature, and the force between two quarks will be screened at suciently large
separation. in the picture with the quarks corresponding to endpoints of a hanging
string, screening occurs when the string breaks and one obtains a conguration with
a string from each of the quarks going straight down through the horizon of the
black hole. with a shell the situation is dierent since the boundary state is not
thermal and screening is not expected. from the bulk point of view there is no
horizon and the string between the quarks can therefore not break. even though
the distance dependence of the force will be aected by the presence of the shell,
there is still a long range contribution.

the simplest two-point function is given by a bulk scalar eld  coupling to an
operator o in the boundary theory. for example,  could be the ve dimensional
6in general, higher n-point correlation functions are needed to have more complete information
about a quantum state. for example, in [20] it was discussed how higher n-point functions are
relevant for understanding the causal structure in ads/cft.

dilaton in ads5, and o the operator trf 2 in the 3+1 dimensional n = 4 sym
theory. also, we will concentrate on the simplest possible situation. we consider
a spherically symmetric thin shell of matter, and focus on the initial stage of the
collapse when the shell is moving very slowly. in that case, we can use a quasistatic
approximation and take the shell radius to be xed. we solve the eld equation of
 on both sides of the shell, impose appropriate boundary conditions, and join the
solutions across the shell. we will then derive the two point function7

ho(t, ~x)o(t, ~x)i

for the corresponding boundary operator o. actually, our calculation will give the
momentum space fourier transform of the two-point function,

g(, ~k) = z dtz dd~x eit+i~k~xho(t, ~x)o(0, 0)i .

(1)

the analytic structure of the propagator gives information on the spectrum of
excitations of the theory. in the presence of the shell, the two point function will be
identied as the retarded propagator gret(, ~k). for a xed value of ~k, the retarded
propagator is analytic in the upper complex  plane. it can be written in an integral
representation form

it is the imaginary part of the

(3)

(see e.g. [30] for discussion.) the spectral density function can be interpreted as
the probability8 that an excitation created by the operator o has an energy  and
a momentum ~k. let us now recall some possible analytic features of the retarded
propagator in a generic qft. if we try to do an analytic continuation to the lower
half-plane, and take the limit   0, we may nd that the propagator has poles at
the real  axis. in the boundary theory, these correspond to elementary excitations
or stable bound states (the latter being possible in an interacting theory). the poles
of the propagator correspond to delta function peaks of the spectral density function.
there may also be cuts, signaling multiparticle states9. we may also nd poles of
the propagator in the lower complex plane, corresponding to unstable bound states

7note that in the case of the static shell, the two-point function will depend only on the

dierences (t  t) and (~x  ~x).

path which led to the ads/cft correspondence. see [1] for more discussion and references.

(resonances). if we denote the location of such a pole by i(~k)  ii, the imaginary
value i is the width of the unstable bound state. the closer to the real axis the pole
is, the longer lived the resonance is. in the spectral density function, the resonances
appear smeared peaks with nite width. (see e.g. [32, 30] for discussion).

thus, the analytic structure of the propagator gives information on the stable
and unstable excitations present in the boundary theory. in general, the operators
o are composite operators built out of the elementary elds of the boundary theory.
hence, we obtain only information about a certain subset of particles propagating
in the boundary, the stable and unstable composite objects that can be created and
annihilated by the operator o.

the key fact is that this gives us enough information to detect the radial size of
the shell. we discover unstable resonances in the boundary theory, whose masses
are multiples of a mass scale set by the radial size of the shell. the boundary theory
is conformal, but it is in an o-equilibrium state characterized by a dimensional
parameter, so the massive resonances can exist.

the resonances are discussed in section 2. in section 3 we discuss the results.

2 propagators in the shell background

we shall now proceed, step by step, to compute the two point function of a bound-
ary operator in the case that a (quasi)static shell of matter is present in the bulk.
although this is an unphysical situation, it can be used as an approximate descrip-
tion of a slowly moving shell. in [4, 3], it was described how to compute boundary
correlators of an operator o(x, t) using classical solutions for a related bulk eld
(r, x, t) using the ads/cft correspondence. the computation method we will use
is a variant of the one described in the appendix of [33].

in all cases, the spacetime is asymptotically adsd+1 (d = 2, 4), and near the

boundary the bulk metric reduces to the approximate form

ds2 r 

r2
r2 dt2 +

r2
r2 dr2 +

r2
r2 d~x2

(4)

where the boundary is at r  . let  be a scalar eld in the bulk, with a mass
m. in minkowski signature, the classical equation of motion

1
g

 (gg(r, ~x, t))  m2(r, ~x, t) = 0

(5)

has two kinds of solutions: normalizable and non-normalizable ones. we denote
the former by (+)(r, ~x, t) and the latter by ()(r, ~x, t); they have an asymptotic
behavior

()(r, ~x, t)  r2h

(r  )

(6)

5

where

h =

1
4

(d 

d2 + 4m2) 

d
4 


2

.

(7)

the starting point is to impose appropriate boundary conditions for the bulk eld
 at the interior of the ads space. in the asymptotic region, the eld will in general
become a superposition of the normalizable and non-normalizable solutions, with
an asymptotic behavior

(r, ~x, t)  r2h++(t, ~x) + r2h(t, ~x) .

(8)

in the above, (t, x) is the boundary data which acts as a source for an operator
o(t, x) in the boundary theory. next, we fourier transform the variables t, x and
write the equation (8) in the form

where

(r, , ~k)  (cid:16)r2h + r2h+g(, ~k)(cid:17) (, ~k) ,

g(, ~k) =

+(, ~k)
(, ~k)

.

one can check that the two point function in the boundary will be

ho(, ~k)o(, ~k)i = (h+  h)( + )(k + ~k)g(, ~k) .

(9)

(10)

(11)

thus, the essential steps of the computation are as follows: one imposes interior
boundary conditions for the bulk eld, writes it as a superposition of the normal-
izable and non-normalizable modes, then the ratio of the superposition coecients
gives the two point function in the boundary. to obtain the answer with a cor-
rect overall coecient (h+  h), one needs to perform the calculations with more
subtlety, as discussed in [33]. however, overall coecients will not be important
here, so they will be suppressed in what follows. the eld (r, ~x, t) must also obey
time boundary conditions related to the fact that one can compute, for example,
retarded, advanced or feynmann propagators. in the absence of interactions, and
with respect to a vacuum, all propagators in momentum space are equal. otherwise,
the propagators can be identied by examining their analytic structure.

as a warm-up, we consider the propagator in the absence of a shell in the bulk.

the full adsd+1 manifold is covered by global coordinates, with the metric

ds2 = 

r2

dt2 +

r2

r2 + r2

r2
r2 d2
d1
where the radial coordinate r extends from 0 to  and d2
d1 is the metric of a
(d  1)-sphere of radius r. the interior boundary condition is that  must be

r2 + r2 dr2 +

(12)

6

regular at the origin r = 0. the solution is expressed as a linear superposition of
normalizable and and nonnormalizable modes in [11]. the propagator (10) is simply
the ratio of the relative coecients, which are found in equation (37) of ref. [11].
the answer is

g(, k) =

()
()

(h+ + r
(h + r

2 ( + k))(h+ + r
2 ( + k))(h + r

2 ( + k))
2 ( + k))

,

(13)

where k = integer/r. the above result is valid when  is not an integer. if  is an
integer then the propagator can be written in terms of derivatives of  functions.
in this case it is easier to compute rst the spectral function part and then use the
integral representation (2) to reconstruct the full propagator. it is easy to see that
the propagator (13) has poles at k = (2n+ h+) 1
r, n = 1, 2, . . . corresponding to
the normalizable modes in ads space. from the boundary point of view the discrete
spectrum is possible since the spatial directions are compactied to a sphere sd2.
accordingly, note that the dispersion relation is not lorentz invariant. between
successive poles, the propagator (13) has also zeroes at   k = (2n + h) 1
r.

in the limit r  , keeping  and k xed, the poles and zeros accumulate and
they degenerate to cuts in the propagator for  > k and  < k. further, in the
limit r   the boundary decompacties. applying the limit to (13), we nd that
the propagator reduces to the form

g(, k)  (2  k2)

(2  k2) .

(14)

thus, we recover the expected result for a free propagator in an innite boundary.
from the bulk point of view one has to take r   with r/r2 xed or equivalently
r  . in this limit the metric reduces to (4). using this metric the propagator
(14) follows immediately. the only subtlety is the boundary condition to use in the
interior since in the large r limit, the point r = 0 corresponds to the coordinate
horizon of a poincare patch. near the horizon any solution can be written as a linear
combination of an ingoing and an outgoing wave. if  has a small imaginary part
it is easily seen (see appendix) that one has to use an ingoing wave for im() > 0
and an outgoing one for im() < 0. the use of dierent boundary conditions for
im() > 0 and im() < 0 produces a cut on the real axis corresponding to switch
from the retarded to the advanced one.

let us now turn to the case of a black hole of radius r+ > r in ads space. now
we must impose a boundary condition at the horizon. again, both solutions of the
wave equation are regular at the horizon. the general solution is a superposition of
an outgoing and an ingoing wave:

  a(r  r+)i 

2 + b(r  r+)i 

2

(r  r+).

(15)

7

imposing the condition that  be regular at r = r+ implies that if im > 0 we take
the solution with a = 0 and with b = 0 if im < 0. since the solutions with a = 0
and with b = 0 are one complex conjugate of the other, the imaginary part of the
propagator changes sign when  crosses the real axis. in the case of a btz black
hole of radius r+, the propagator (10) follows from10 [13, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] and is

gret(, k) = lim
0

g( + i, k) =

(1  )
(1 + )

(h+  ir
(h  ir

2 ( + k))(h+  ir
2 ( + k))(h  ir

2 (  k))
2 (  k))

(16)
as before, if  is integer then the calculation must be done more carefully. for
example, for  = 1 the result is

g(, k) =

(2  k2)

t 2

+k

1
2t  1

e

k

1
2t  1

(17)

this propagator can be understood as a thermal propagator of a composite opera-
tor. acting on a vacuum, the operator o creates states with right- and leftmoving
particles of two-momentum k1 = (1, 1) and k2 = (2,2). these two-particle
states have total energy  = 1 + 2 and total momentum k = 1  2. with this
notation the propagator reads

g(, k) =

1
t 2

.

(18)

now it is obvious that this is a thermal propagator for a composite operator prop-
agating two particle states. the bose occupation numbers arise from the gamma
functions [40]. in fact this propagator follows simply from conformal invariance, so
it does not give us any information about interactions in the boundary theory, only
that it is at temperature t  r+/r2. a similar calculation can be done for the black
hole in ads5 using the function obtained in [14]. the result is similar to the case of
ads3 although it cannot be expressed in terms of special functions as in (16).

after this lengthy introduction, we are prepared to compute the propagator in
the presence of a shell of radius rs. in the interior of the shell, the metric is the ads
metric in global coordinates, given by (12). the exterior metric is the ads black
hole metric,

where the parameter  is related to the adm mass of the black hole and determines
the horizon radius r+. the interior boundary condition for the eld  is the same

(21)

and k2
r2 = l(l + d  2), l  z0 is the eigenvalue of the laplacian on the sphere
sd1. the solutions of the eld equation, 1 for r < rs and 2 for r > rs, are the
known solutions in the global and black hole coordinates. the matching conditions
at r = rs are

1|r=rs = 2|r=rs

f1(r)r1|r=rs = f2(r)r2|r=rs

(22)

(23)

where the last condition follows from integrating the equation between rs and rs+
with   0. it also ensures current conservation. using the matching conditions the
propagator follows as

g(, k) =

where ()
are the normalizable and non-normalizable modes in the black hole back-
ground (in three dimensions, they can be found in [13]), and 1 is the mode in global
coordinates that is regular at r = 0. we have performed this calculation, and have
found a tower of resonances in the boundary theory. however, it will be much
simpler and more illustrative to discuss a computation which uses some additional
approximation methods, which are good for a large shell with radius rs  r+  r.
in this limit, the metric in the interior reduces to the poincare metric, so the solu-
tion in the interior will be a poincare mode. correspondingly, the interior boundary
condition will be mapped to those in a poincare patch, as we discussed before in
the context of the large r limit. we will relegate the details in the appendix, and
quote just the end result. by studying the propagator in d dimensions, we nd that
it has an innite number of poles at the complex values

as we discussed in the introduction, these poles are interpreted as unstable excita-
tions (resonances) in the boundary theory that appear due to the shell background.
the real part (the mass) is proportional to the radius of the shell. we call the

9

unstable excitations as shellons. note also that the width is also of the order of
the shell radius, hence the shellons have a short lifetime. this is good, since then a
slowly moving shell is static compared to the lifetime of the shellons, and the results
are consistent with the quasistatic approximation.

3 discussion

our calculation shows the existence of unstable excitations, shellons, with properties
like mass and life time depending on the radius of the shell. thus, in particular, one
can detect a dierence between spherical shells of dierent radii but with the same
mass. it would be very interesting to have a more detailed understanding of how
the shellons and their properties are to be understood from the boundary point of
view.

another important problem is to let the shell fall freely and follow its evolution
into a black hole. let us make some comments on what to expect, but rst we need
a more detailed understanding of the composition of the shell from the boundary
point of view. we begin with a static shell consisting of a large number of elementary
particles. a single particle with mass of the order 1/r at rest at radius rs, will
through holography show up as a blob in the boundary with size r2/rs, and total
energy given by e  rs/r2. the shell will therefore be a superposition of such blobs,
and correspond to a state that is out of thermal equilibrium with a homogeneous
energy density.
if we turn to the falling shell, each blob will turn into a bubble
expanding at the speed of light [14]. and a falling dust shell containing several
particles will then correspond to a superposition of such expanding bubbles. how
will they interact?

to understand this, it is useful to consider rst a particle falling into a black
hole. in [14] the shape of a bubble produced by a particle falling into a btz black
hole was given. if one considers the energy momentum tensor as in [25] then the
shape is given by11 :

t00 =

1

(cid:16)a2 + (1 + a2) sinh2 r+(x+t)

2

(cid:17)2 +

1

(cid:16)a2 + (1 + a2) sinh2 r+(xt)

2

(cid:17)2

(26)

where a is a parameter related to the initial position of the particle and r+ is the
radius of the black hole. we see then that in this case the bubble still propagates at
the speed of light. however, for xed t, the energy density decays exponentially for

11this follows simply by performing the conformal transformation that corresponds to change

from global to btz coordinates in the bulk

10

large x with a characteristic length of 1/t where t  r+/r2 is the temperature of
the black hole, while if no thermal bath is present, it decays with a power law. if the
particles consist of supergravity modes, their mass is of order  1/r while that of
a black hole is  n 2/r and so we need order n 2 of them. in the large n limit the
gas of bubbles in the boundary will be very dense and we expect that each bubble
will see a mean eld created by the rest. each bubble will then expand similarly
as in eq.(26). alternatively, we can have a dilute gas of bubbles in the boundary
if the shell consists of k dust particles, each containing of the order n 2 elementary
particles of mass 1/r. this could be thought of as a shell consisting of k black
holes (of course in this case it is not a thin shell). in the boundary, one now nds a
dilute gas of k expanding bubbles. even when the falling dust approaches r+, it is
easy to see that the bubbles still remain dilute, unless the boundary equivalent of
the bulk gravitational interactions are taken into account. the interactions will, as
the nal black hole forms, merge all the bubbles into a homogeneous background.
another way to understand this is to note that the holographic scale/radius relation
is changed when the deviation from a pure ads metric becomes important, making
the bubbles even larger. does this mean that the k small black holes have merged
into one big black hole? in this context it is important to know the strength of the
interactions. the interactions between the black holes that make up the shell are not
suppressed by powers of n, and are therefore part of the supergravity description.
in units where r = 1, the newtons constant is g  1/n 2, but since the mass of
each of the black holes that make up the shell is m  n 2, [25] the corrections to
the metric around one of the black holes are gm  1. however, we do not expect
these collective interactions to result in a nal thermal state, since this will require
interactions between the individual particles that make up the black holes and the
shell. an interaction between any two elementary particles will be suppressed by
powers of n, and therefore thermalization is expected to be a 1/n eect. we
expect this to be a general result, not depending on the detailed composition of the
collapsing shell. it is intriguing that similar results have been obtained previously in
studies of thermalization in large n eld theories in a dierent context [41, 42, 43].
in fact the collapse of the falling shell gives interesting information about the non-
equilibrium processes they have studied. however a precise relation is certainly
lacking.

while it is satisfying that we can nd information in the boundary theory about
a collapsing shell in the bulk, it is also obvious that this is just a step towards
understanding the formation of black holes as a hologram. one of the steps to follow
would be to go beyond the quasistatic approximation and study what happens as
the shell is falling rapidly, or what happens when it crosses its schwarzschild radius.

11

it will also be interesting to study what happens when the resulting black hole is
small and has a negative specic heat. another interesting issue would be to add
charge to the collapsing matter, to make contact with the recently discussed charged
ads black hole solutions [44, 45].

appendix

we are interested in nding the solutions in the region near the radius of the shell,
where we match the interior solution with the exterior solutions. if the shell is large,
this region is at r  r, where the interior metric takes the approximate form (4).
correspondingly, the interior solutions are equal to the poincare modes, which can
be expressed using bessel functions, as discussed e.g. in [11]. the situation is now
analogous to the large r limit which we discussed in section 2. the continuum of
poincare modes will correspond to a cut in the propagator. correspondingly, we have
a choice of two interior boundary conditions: the solution must look like an ingoing
or outgoing wave as r  0. which one is appropriate follows by taking the unique
solution in global coordinates and obtaining its behaviour for large frequencies.
alternatively one can reason as follows: an ingoing wave behaves as

where we set r = 1 as in the rest of the appendix. if  has a small positive imaginary
part the function is well behaved for r  0 but it blows up if the imaginary part
is negative. so an ingoing wave is appropriate for the region above the cut, and an
outgoing wave for the region below. we choose the former condition, so in the end
we will obtain a retarded propagator. we denote the interior solution by 1, as in
section 2.

outside the shell the solution to equation (20) cannot be expressed in terms of
known functions (except for the btz black hole). so we use a wkb approximation.
again we consider the region r  r+  r. to start with, we rewrite the equation

12

(20) in an alternative form. first, we rescale the eld as

(r, , k) =

1

qrd1f (r)

(r, , k)

(28)

where f (r) = f2(r) = 1 + r2  /rd2. then, the equation for the function  can be
written in a form which resembles a schrodinger equation

 rr() + v (r)() = 0

with a potential

v (r) =

outside the shell, we want to nd the normalizable and non-normalizable solu-

tions , which satisfy the boundary conditions

(31)

(32)

where  = qd2/4 + m2 and k2 = l(l + d  2) (where l is a nonnegative integer). in

this case the equation can be solved in terms of bessel functions, and we nd the
normalizable and non-normalizable modes to be

()(r, , k)  2(1  )(2  k2) 

2rj  2  k2

(33)

however, in the region (d2  1)r2/4  2  k2, namely for large frequencies, better
approximate solutions are obtained using the wkb expression

 =

v 1/4 (cid:18)a exp(iz q v (r)dr) + b exp(iz q v (r)dr)(cid:19)

with

v (r) =

matching the wkb functions with the bessel functions, the following expressions
are obtained for the normalizable and nonnormalizable modes:

in the region (d  1)r2/4  2  k2 and r  r+. these expressions will be used to
nd the propagator using (24).

thus, for large frequencies, we can use the approximate solutions (36) outside the
shell. in the large frequency limit, the poincare mode 1, discussed above, reduces
to the form (we can focus on k = 0)

1d

2 ei

(37)

up to some constants which cancel in the propagator. inserting the above expressions
to the formula (24), we obtain the propagator (at k = 0)

a useful check is that for r+ = 0 the last fraction in the propagator is a constant, so
the propagator correctly reduces to the expected form in pure ads. the propagator
has poles when the denominator vanishes. for rs  r+ it follows that there are
poles at the values of  which satisfy

where n is a (large) positive integer. notice that the imaginary part is negative since
rs > r+.

finally, we would like to emphasize we have also performed a calculation using
the exact solutions in global and black hole coordinates, with regularity at r = 0 as
the interior boundary condition. in that case, the resonances are found by examining
the imaginary part of the propagator, the spectral function. they are seen in the
envelope that modulates the amplitudes of the spikes associated with the elementary
excitations (the poles at the real values of . the envelope has periods of hills and
valleys, and by examining the position and the width of the hill one can deduce
the position of the complex poles.
in this case the calculations were performed
numerically. in this way one obtains a better approximation for the location of the
poles, but the qualitative results remain the same. the approximations used in the
above give accurate enough results to reach the main conclusions in the case of large
shells.
