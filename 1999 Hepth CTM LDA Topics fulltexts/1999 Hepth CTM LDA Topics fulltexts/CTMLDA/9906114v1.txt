airy functions

in the thermodynamic bethe ansatz

paul fendley

abstract. thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations are coupled non-linear
integral equations which appear frequently when solving integrable models.
those associated with models with n =2 supersymmetry can be related to
dierential equations, among them painleve iii and the toda hierarchy. in
the simplest such case the massless limit of these non-linear integral equations
can be solved in terms of the airy function. this is the only known closed-form
solution of thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations, outside of free or classical
models. this turns out to give the spectral determinant of the schrodinger
equation in a linear potential.

a great deal of interesting mathematical physics has arisen from the study of
integrable models of statistical mechanics and eld theory. one interesting area is
known as the thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba), which has proven a useful tool
for computing the free energy of an integrable 1+1 dimensional system [1]. one ends
up with a set of coupled non-linear integral equations, the tba equations. one
completely-unexpected result was a correspondence between a limit of these integral
equations and some very well-studied non-linear dierential equations, namely the
toda hierarchy [2]. the purpose of this paper is to extend these results further,
and show that in at least one case there is a closed-form but non-trivial solution of
the integral equations. not only is it interesting that such complicated equations
have a simple solution in terms of the airy function, but proving it requires some
utilizing some very intricate results involving the painleve iii dierential equation
[2, 3, 4]. moreover, it turns out to be related to the spectral determinant of the
schrodinger equation in a linear potential [5, 6, 7].

the tba integral equations are generically of the form

(1)

a() = ma cosh  xb

z d

ab(  ) ln(1 + ebb( )).

physically, t a() is the energy for creating a particle of type a and rapidity  in a
thermal bath at temperature t . the ma are the particle masses over temperature,
while the a are their chemical potentials over temperature. the kernels ab are
a result of the interactions between particles. this and all unlabelled integrals in
this paper run from  to . the free energy per unit length is
ma cosh  ln(1 + eaa()).

here we study tba equations where the underlying physical system has n =2
supersymmetry. the amazing thing is that solutions of a particular limit of such
tba equations are simply related to solutions of a non-linear dierential equation

[2]. particles in an n =2 theory all have a charge, fa, known as their fermion num-
ber. when the chemical potentials are a = ifa, a consequence of supersymmetry
is that the a in (1) are all constants and the free energy is f = 0. this is known as
the witten index (the usual integer contributions to the index do not contribute to
the free energy per unit length) [8]. the result of [2] is that for chemical potentials
a = i(  h)fa, one can derive a dierential equation for the order h piece of the
free energy. the simplest cases give the painleve iii dierential equation and the
toda hierarchy.

the tba equations for the case at hand were derived in [9]. they have 12 =
13 = 1/ cosh  with ab = ba and other ab = 0, while m2 = m3 = 0, and
f1 = 0, f2 = f3 = 1. for small positive h, the functions a and b are dened by
1() = a()  ln h, and 2() = 3() = hb(). the order h tba equations are

where 2u() = m1 cosh  here. in [2], a physics proof was given that the resulting
free energy is simply related to a solution of the painleve iii dierential equation
with variable m1. this is a physics proof because one method of computation
gives integral equations, the other the dierential equations. this result was ex-
tended considerably in [3]. subsequently, the equivalence was proven directly and
rigorously in [4].

a particularly interesting situation is the massless limit, where m1 is very
small. then 2u() = e, because m1 can be removed by redening  by a shift.
the result of this paper is a and b in (3,4) can be found in closed form in this
massless limit.

result:
when u() = e/2, the solution of (3,4) is

ea() = 2
b() = 2

(ai(z))2

where z = (3e/4)2/3 and ai(z) is the airy function.

to check the normalization, note that (3,4) imply that ea()  2/3 and b() 
1/3 as   , in agreement with the limits of the appropriate airy functions
as z  0. ai(z) is a solution of the dierential equation w = zw, while ea()
and b() solve w  4zw = 6w.
as far as i can tell, it is dicult to prove the result by direct substitution into the
integrals, but requires utilizing some additional structure. first, dene the integral
operator k which maps functions to functions with the kernel

where

k(, ) = 2

,

e() = e/2eu().

solutions of painleve iii can be expressed in terms of this operator k [10, 2, 3]
when 2u = m1 cosh . the functions z+ and z are dened as

z+ = e2/3(i + k)1e

(7)
these z are simply related to the q p = (i  k)1e used in [4]. it was proven
in [2, 3, 4] that functions a and b solve (3,4) if

z = e/3(i  k)1e

(8)

(9)

ea() = 4z+()z()
b() = 4ei/3eu(+i/2)+u(i/2)z+(  i/2)z( + i/2)  i

the functions (8,9) obey (3,4) for any entire u() obeying u() = u( + 2i) [3, 4],
not only the special case u() = e/2 analyzed in this paper.

with the similarity between (3,4) and (8,9), proving the result is equivalent to

proving that

(10)

z+() = ai(z)

z() = ai (z)

when u() = e/2. the expression (6) for b() follows by using a few airy-function
identities. the expressions for z in (10) can be proven by directly evaluating the
integral in their denition. specically, (7) requires that

(11)

e() = e2/3z+() + 2e()z dz+()ee

/2 e7 /6
e + e 

dening x  e/2 and using the expression of an airy function in terms of a bessel
function, the integral is proportional to

dx ex 2x

e + 2x

z 

0

k1/3(x).

this can be looked up in [11], or evaluated by using mellin transforms, under which
the bessel function k has nice properties. one indeed nds that (11) and the
analogous relation for z are true when z are given by (10). since the solution
with the appropriate analyticity properties (no zeroes and bounded in the strip
|im| < /2) is unique [4], the result is proven.
the functions z+() and z() are interesting in their own right. they arose as
a sort of partition function of the boundary-sine gordon problem [12] at coupling
g=2/3, and equivalently as the continuum version of the baxter q-operator [13] in
studies of conformal eld theory [14]. the q operator gives the generating function
of the conserved quantities (local and non-local) of the theory. up to normalization,
the functions z are zbsg(z,1/3) in [12], and hq(z)i at p = 1/6 in [14]. thus
the result here provides the only case (other than where the system is free or
classical) where these quantities can be computed explicitly. in fact, it provides
strong evidence that the results of [12, 14] are applicable in the repulsive regime
g > 1/2 as conjectured. for example, it shows that the zeroes of the eigenvalues of
the q-operator obey the pattern conjectured in [14]. the quantum wronskian
of [14] becomes equivalent to the proposition of [4], and both are easily veried
by using the (ordinary) wronskian of the airy functions. also, by using the series
expansion of [12], it gives a strange sequence of identities of sums of products of
gamma functions.

recently, the work of [14] also arose in a completely new context. namely, it
was observed in [6] that the spectral determinant for the schrodinger equation in a

4

potential |x| for any  is given precisely by the vacuum eigenvalue of this baxter q-
operator. a non-zero angular momentum can be added, and this correspondence
still holds [7]. this is because the quantum wronskian is equivalent to a set of
functional relations for the spectral determinant derived in [5, 7]. the result above
then means that airy function is the spectral determinant for the schrodinger
equation in a linear potential, a result shown directly in [5].
it would be most
interesting to understand how to extend this result.

since this system discussed in this paper provides the simplest example of the
dierential equation/tba correspondence [2], it seems likely that there is a simple
solution of the massless limit of any tba equations of this type. what is not yet
known outside of this case is the detailed analysis of the dierential equation of [10],
which was vital to the results of [4]. given how beautifully the airy function solved
the problem here, it would be quite interesting to see how this result is generalized.

this work was mostly done in spring 1996, while i was a postdoc at the uni-
versity of southern california. i thank hubert saleur and the packard foundation
for support then. it was presented in 1997 at the supersymmetry and integrable
models workshop, university of illinois-chicago, and the international workshop
on statistical mechanics and integrable systems in coolongatta. i thank the or-
ganizers for their hospitality. i thank p. dorey for conversations, and s. lukyanov
for urging me to write this up despite the late date. currently, my work is sup-
ported by a doe oji award, a sloan foundation fellowship, and by nsf grant
dmr-9802813.
