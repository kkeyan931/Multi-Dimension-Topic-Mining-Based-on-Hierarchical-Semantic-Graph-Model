abstract

a map between string junctions in the ane 7-brane backgrounds and vector bun-
dles on del pezzo surfaces is constructed using mirror symmetry. it is shown that the
lattice of string junctions with support on an ane 7-brane conguration is isomor-
phic to the k-theory group of the corresponding del pezzo surface. this isomorphism
allows us to construct a map between the states of the n = 2, d=4 theories with en
global symmetry realized in two dierent ways in type iib and type iia string theory.

a subgroup of the sl(2, zz) symmetry of the be9 7-brane background appears as the

fourier-mukai transform acting on the d-brane congurations realizing vector bundles
on elliptically bered b9.

1 introduction

the study of d-branes has provided important insights into non-perturbative aspects of
string theory as well as supersymmetric gauge theories. supersymmetric eld theories are
realized in string theory either as the eective world-volume theory of a conguration of d-
branes or as the theory on the transverse space after compactication on some appropriate
manifold.
in the later case d-branes wrapped on various cycles of the compactication
manifold give rise to particles and non-critical strings in the gauge theory. thus d-branes
provide a geometrical description of states in the supersymmetric gauge theories.

along the process of realizing qfts as eective models in string theory, previously unknown
exotic susy theories have also been found. an example is the n = 1 six dimensional e8
theory [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] whose compactication on a torus leads to n = 2 theories with en
global symmetry [8]. these four dimensional theories and their spectra are the focus of our
paper. since there are dierent ways of obtaining eective eld theories in string theory, some
models can be realized in dierent ways. our aim is to compare two dierent realizations
of the same theory, namely d = 4, n = 2 sym theory with en global symmetry which
arises both as the worldvolume theory of a threebrane in iib (or f-theory) [9, 10, 11, 12]
near a particular set of 7-branes, and as the compactication of iia on a cy threefold
[12, 13, 14, 7, 15] with a shrinking del pezzo surface in it. in this paper we will construct
the precise map between the spectra of the two dierent realizations of the theory.

we will rst review both constructions. the states in the iia theory on the transverse space
are obtained by wrapping d-branes on various cycles in the del pezzo and the description of
the spectrum consists of the classication of sheaves on the surface. on the type iib side
the states of the d3-brane world-volume theory are (p, q) strings and string junctions with
support on 7-branes and the d3-brane. in the next section we explain that both the image
of the sheaves in the k-theory group and the junctions form a lattice. in the third section an
isomorphism between these two lattices is established and in the last section an application
of this isomorphism is given which identies the fourier-mukai transform [16] of sheaves on
b9 with the sl(2, zz) symmetry of the dual brane conguration in iib.

2 n = 2 theories with en global symmetry

2.1 compactication of iia

we begin by reviewing how d = 4, n = 2 eld theories with exceptional global symmetry
can be be realized in iia string theory. of the several ways involving the low energy limit

2

of d-brane congurations or compactications we use the approach commonly referred to
as geometric engineering. compactication of iia string theory on a non-compact cy
threefold with a shrinking 4-cycle x gives rise to a low energy theory with 8 supercharges on
the transverse space, whose spectrum is determined by the homology of that 4-cycle. when
the shrinking manifold is a del pezzo surface, the low energy theory acquires exceptional
global symmetry because the lattice of 2-cycles contains the root lattice of an exceptional
algebra and thus admits the action of the corresponding weyl group.

the states of the eld theory are obtained from iia d-branes wrapping various submani-
folds of x : d0s on points, d2s wrapping 2-cycles and d4s on x itself. a conguration of
q d4-branes is a u(q)-bundle on x with instanton number given by the number of d0s
and rst chern class being the poincare dual to the homology class wrapped by d2-branes
[17, 18]. proper description of these d-brane congurations requires the more sophisticated
notion of sheaves on x [19, 20]. this becomes essential if congurations with and without
d4-branes are to be dealt with on equal footing. bps states, which arise from supersym-
metric congurations of d-branes, correspond to coherent semi-stable sheaves on x [19].
if a supersymmetric conguration of d-branes contains d4-branes then the corresponding
coherent semi-stable sheaf is equivalent to a stable holomorphic vector bundle 1.

a del pezzo surface x is a two complex dimensional manifold constructed by blowing up n
points on ip2 or n  1 points on ip1  ip1, where n  9. we denote these two families as

ebn and bn , respectively; moreover ebn = bn for n > 1, and thus it is sucient to consider
b1 = ip1  ip1 and ebn for n = 0 . . . 9. the ninth del pezzo eb9 is also known as 1

2k3 [21]
since it is an elliptically bered manifold with a base b = ip1 and twelve degenerate elliptic
bers.

2.1.1 the homology of ebn and the en root lattice
ebn 8: the 2nd homology group h2(ebn ) is n + 1 dimensional and is generated by the

elements {l, e1, . . . , en }, where l is the generator of h2(ip2) and ei (i = 1 . . . n) are the
exceptional curves. the intersection numbers are

#(l  l) = 1,

#(ei  ej) = ij ,

#(l  ei) = 0.

i=1 ei, it is used to dene the degree of a 2-cycle  as

the canonical class is kebn
the homology lattice h2(ebn ) contains the root lattice n of the en algebra. to see this,
identify the set of roots as n = {c  h2(ebn , zz)|#(c  c) = 2, dc = 0}, and choose the

since h2(eb9) contains the ane e8 root lattice, it admits the action of the ane e8 weyl

group and all curves fall into representations of ane e8 such that d and c are the level
and the grade of the representation respectively.

2.1.2 the k-theory group of del pezzo surfaces

the k-theory group of ebn and b1 are given as [22]:

k(b1) = zz  zz  zz  zz .

(7)

the k-theory group of ebn (b1) is generated by n + 3 (4) elements and being torsion free it
is isomorphic to the cohomology group h (ebn ) (h (b1)). the map is given by

k(x )  e  ch(e)  h (x ).

(8)

there is a natural bilinear form on k(x ) [22]: let e1,2  k(x ) then

he1, e2i  zx

ch(e1)  ch(e

with this bilinear form k(ebn ) has signature (n + 1, 2). this scalar product was also

considered in [23] where it was shown that for certain manifolds the matrix of scalar products
of exceptional sheaves is the same as the soliton counting matrix [24] of the corresponding
landau-ginzburg theory. we plan to explore the relation between the exceptional sheaves
on del pezzos, solitons of the corresponding n = 2 landau-ginzburg theories and string
junctions living on ane 7-brane backgrounds further in the future.

2.2 probe theory in iib

four-dimensional n = 2 theories can be realized as the world-volume theory of a d3-brane
probe in the vicinity of some 7-branes of iib string theory. the algebra of the 7-branes
appears as the global symmetry in the 4d eld theory. the states arise from strings and string
junctions[25] stretched between the d3 and (some of) the 7-branes and are characterized by
the charges of each 7-brane. viewing the setup as an f-theory compactication on k3, these
states have the following geometrical interpretation. the position of the d3-brane singles
out a xed elliptic ber e and the strings/junctions with a ( p
q ) string segment ending on
the d3-brane can be viewed as curves in the k3 whose boundary wraps the (p, q)-cycle of
e. in the dual m-theory picture the selected elliptic ber is wrapped by an m5-brane and
the states arise from m2 branes wrapping the curves in k3 which end on the m5-brane [26].

the low energy eld theory on the d3-brane in the vicinity of certain congurations of m
7-branes is insensitive to the remaining 24m 7-branes 4. for the sake of simplicity we might

2we will use the same symbol for the 2-form and its dual 2-cycle. thus #(a  b) rx a  b.
3rx c1(x )  c1(x ) = 9  n andrx c2(x ) = n + 3 for x = bn .

4it was shown in [30] that the only 7-brane backgrounds which allow such a decoupling are the ones with

elliptic or parabolic monodromy.

5

replace the k3 in our arguments by an elliptically bered noncompact ricci-at manifold
mm containing these m singular bers only. then the spectrum of the four dimensional
probe theory is characterized by the curves of (the elliptically bered) mm with boundary
on the selected elliptic ber e, or the relative homology h2(mm, e). the natural norm
on this lattice is given by the self-intersection of the homology elements. the bps states
correspond to the holomorphic curves, which satisfy

#(c  c) = 2g  2 + b,

(12)

b and g being the number of boundary components on the e and the genus of the curve
respectively.

let us now specify the particular 7-brane backgrounds of our interest. the well-known en
kodaira singularities (n < 9) can be understood in terms of n + 2 7-branes, of which at
most n may be mutually local. a string (junction) state can be identied by specifying its
charge with respect to each 7-brane (linking number [27] or invariant charge [28]) and thus
is an element of an n + 2 dimensional lattice. to nd the theories which are dual to the
ones presented in the previous section, we need a lattice of one more dimension. as it was
pointed out in [29], the relevant 7-brane background is obtained by adding an extra 7-brane

to the en conguration so that it becomes ben, which was studied in detail in [31, 32, 33]
and is summarized in the following subsections. the junction lattice of ben, j 2,n +1, is n + 3

dimensional and is of signature (2, n + 1).

2.2.1

we consider the type iib background with n + 3 non-local 7-branes of the conguration

ben <9. the elliptic bration of the corresponding f-theory manifold, ben is characterized
1pq(cid:17).
denote a [p, q] 7-brane as x[p,q], with corresponding inverse monodromy5 kp,q =(cid:16) 1+pq p2
then ben is dened in terms of the following 7-brane conguration6:

q2

(13)

k(ben ) =(cid:18) 1 9n

k(ben ) being the overall monodromy. if we remove the x[0,1]-brane, the remaining n +2

7-branes can be collapsed to the en kodaira-singularity with overall monodromy and asso-
ciated binary quadratic form [32]:

k(en ) =(cid:18) 1

9  n

+ pq + q2.

(14)

5 kp,q is the sl(2, zz) action felt by a string as it crosses the branch cut of the 7-brane.

6this conguration is identical to ben of [33] up to an overall transformation with t 4  sl(2, zz).

6

let us consider en rst. in a suitable basis [28] a junction can be written as j =pn

i +
q, and the self-intersection form on the homology lattice h2(en , e) factorizes such

p
that the curve j with boundary wrapping the (p, q)-cycle of the e has norm

i=1 i

p + q

(j, j) = 2

en + fen (p, q),

(15)

where  is a vector of the en weight lattice. back to ben , the addition of the aning x[0,1]

7-brane gives rise to one more basis element, which we call (1,0) and choose to be a closed
( 1

0 ) string (oriented counterclockwise) encircling all of the 7-branes:

nxi=1

j =

i

i + p

p + q

q + n(1,0),

(j, j) = 2

en + 2nq + fen (p, q).

(16)

(17)

in this case the norm does not factorize as in (15); the rst two terms, however, can be

regarded as the norm of a weight vector in the ane lattice ben .
eqns. (15) (17) determine the self-intersection number of a curve in ben with boundary on

the selected ber. there is some ambiguity in extending this formula to mutual intersection
between curves whose boundary wraps dierent cycles of the torus, which is resolved by
specifying the contribution of the intersecting boundaries of two curves depicted in fig. 1.
linearity of the intersection number requires that if j1 and j2 wrap the (p1, q1) and (p2, q2)

(j1, j2)boundary = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) p1 p2

q1 q2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) .
(j2, j1)boundary = (1  )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) p1 p2

in [28] the contribution was postulated to be symmetric ( = 1
2 ), which led to fractional
intersection numbers in general. this is not suitable for us because the metric on the lattice
of the dual theory is manifestly integral. we shall utilize the simplest integral choice:  = 1,
so that (j1, j2)boundary = p1q2q1p2 and (j2, j1)boundary = 0. together with (17) this uniquely
xes the intersection matrix on the junction lattice which is straightforward to determine.

going beyond n = 8 in the series of the 7-brane congurations of (13) we encounter be9 which

is special from numerous aspects. the overall monodromy is trivial and as a consequence,
it admits two linearly independent closed strings encircling the 7-branes.
it is useful to
visualize the conguration in the following way:

3-cycles and string junctions

mirror symmetry relates type iia string theory compactied on a calabi-yau threefold m
it follows from the interpretation of mirror
to type iib on the mirror manifold w [35].

8

symmetry as t-duality [36, 37] that the even cohomology classes of m are mapped to the
odd cohomology classes of w and therefore the complexied kahler structure parameters
of m are exchanged with the complex structure parameters of w [38]. vector bundles with
characteristic classes represented by the even cohomology classes map to 3-cycles dual to the
odd cohomology classes [39].

2.3.1 the mirror of a calabi-yau threefold containing b9

a calabi-yau threefold, m, containing b9 can be described as a double elliptic bration over
ip1 [21],

y2
i = x3

i + f4,i(z) xi + g6,i(z),

i = 1, 2,

(24)

where z is the coordinate on the ip1. the total space of each bration over the sphere
denes a b9 surface. as shown in [21], this cy threefold can also be obtained by resolving
the singularities of a zz2  zz2 orbifold of t 2  t 2  t 2. if 1,2,3 are the complex coordinates
on the three tori then the orbifold action is given by [21]

(1, 2, 3)  (1 + 1

2 , 2, 3)

and

(1, 2, 3)  (1, 2 + 1

2 , 3),

(25)

dx2
y2

and the third torus becomes the ip1 after the identication. the holomorphic 3-form is
with z being the coordinate on the ip1. to obtain the non-compact cy-
(3) = dz dx1
y1
threefold containing b9, we decompactify the ber of one of the elliptic brations by tak-
ing its area to innity i.e. we consider the limit of the complexied kahler parameter
b + ia    i.

the mirror threefold w is obtained by performing t-duality on one of the cycles of each
torus. the decompactication limit of m then maps to the limit of w when the complex
structure parameter  of the elliptic bration goes to i which in eect decompacties one
of the cycles of the torus. the local model for this is given by

y2
2  x2

2 = (z  z).

(26)

since we want the degenerate complex structure limit for the entire elliptic bration, we
adopt the above model globally over ip1. the structure of w then is that of a t 2  s1
c  ir
bration over a ip1 and the holomorphic 3-form becomes

(3) = dz

dx1
y1

dx2
x2

=

(27)

where (2) is the holomorphic 2-form on b9. since the canonical bundle of b9 is non-trivial
this holomorphic two form has zeros or poles at the 2-cycle dual to the rst chern class of

9

the canonical bundle. the total space can be visualized as a double bration over ip1: the
t 2 bration constitutes a b9 surface and a cylinder is also bered over its base. at one point
z  ip1 the nontrivial cycle of the s1
c  ir shrinks to zero size. we denote the elliptic ber
of b9 above this point by e.

at z the s1

c shrinks.

2.3.2 3-cycles in w

mirror symmetry maps the even homology of m to the odd homology of w . since w is
simply connected the only odd homology elements of w are the 3-cycles of the following
type [21]:

 s1

c  s2: here s2 = c is a curve in b9 and s1
c is the non-trivial cycle of the s1  ir
bration. there are eight such cycles on which the holomorphic 3-form (3) is non-
zero: s1
c  ci, i = 1 . . . 8 with ci given in (3) corresponding to the roots of the e8 root
lattice embedded in h2(b9).

 s3: there are two such (linearly independent) cycles. they are formed by s1

bered over intervals i1,2 such that s1 shrinks on one end of the interval and s1
at the other side.

c  s1
c shrinks

c in the s1

 t 3: there are again two (linearly independent) cycles of this type. these are formed
by s1
c  ir bration and a torus in the b9. the torus in the b9 is formed from
the circle surrounding the position of the degenerate bers on the base and a 1-cycle
of the elliptic ber.

10

2.3.3 string junctions from 3-cycles

let  : b9 = x  ip1 be an elliptic bration. we denote by e = 1(z), as discussed
before, a xed non-degenerate elliptic ber. the section e : ip1  x is such that e(ip1) = b
with b2 = 1. the three-cycles in the non-compact calabi-yau threefold w are of the form
c  s1
c , where c is a curve in b9 with a boundary such that c  e = c  h1(e, zz). with
any such curve c  x we can associate a junction jc living on the base b,

jc = e((c)).

(28)

if c = 0, the corresponding junction has no asymptotic charge and has support only on
the 7-branes, the positions of the degenerate bers. when c = (p, q)  h1(e, zz) the
corresponding junction has asymptotic charge (p, q) on the d3-brane, the position of e on
the base.

we summarize the mirror symmetry map between the homology of b9 and the 3-cycles of
the mirror calabi-yau w in the following table. i1 and i2 represent curves on the base from
z1 and z12 to z respectively.  is the path encircling the 7-branes. s1 and s1

dierent values of m correspond to dierent bundles on . we denote by o(m) a bundle
(torsion sheaf) on  with ch(o(m)) = (0 ,  , m + 1
2d). a d2-brane wrapped on b
maps to a d4-brane wrapped on b9 after t-duality, which we will interpret as an sl(2, zz)
transformation by s. therefore we require that the map between the junctions and bundles
should satisfy the following conditions:

 the rank of the bundle f is the q-charge of the corresponding junction.

 the degree d of the rst chern class  of the bundle, is the p-charge of the junction.

 hf , f i = #(jf  jf ).

by equating the two scalar products and requiring that they be equal for all (r, d) = (q, p)
we get a unique map between the bundle data and the junction data. it follows that a bundle
f with

ii + d(b + f ) + cf,

ch(f ) = (r ,  , k) ,

by this process we not only decouple the string junction with support on that brane but we
also lose the (0,1) string junction. it then follows from (32) that a class f  k(bn ) such
that

ch(f ) = (r ,  , k) ,  =

(34)

where r + k + 1
2d  (f ) is the euler-poincare characteristic of f . k(bn ) is an abelian
group, the inverse of f is f and the associated junction is jf . with this identication
we get

hf1, f2i = #(jf1  jf2).

(35)

3.3 genus of the junction and dimension of the moduli space

let f be a stable holomorphic vector bundle on b9 with ch(f ) = (r, , k) such that
gcd(r, d) = 1. we denote the corresponding special lagrangian 3-cycle in the mirror calabi-
yau and the bps junction by cf and jf respectively. the dimension of the moduli space
m(r, , k) of the vector bundle is hf , f i + 1 while the moduli space is empty if hf , f i > 1
[41, 40]. from the correspondence with junctions we see that [42]

dim m(r, , k) = #(jf  jf ) + 1

= 2g  2 + gcd(r, d) + 1 = 2g,

(36)

where g is the genus of the curve associated with the junction. this is in agreement with
vafas conjecture [39] that the map between the 3-cycles and the vector bundles should be
such that

it follows from the above identication that

h i(end f ) = h i(cf , w ).

hf , f i  p2
= p2

i=0(1)idim exti(f , f ) p2
i=0(1)idim h i(cf , w ) =p2

= (cf ) + 1

i=0(1)idim h i(end f )
i=0(1)ibi

and therefore

dim m(r, , k) = hf , f i + 1

= (cf ) = 2g.

3.4 fourier-mukai transform and sl(2, zz)

in this section we will show that a fourier-mukai transformation [16] on b9 = x can be

let f be a complex of sheaves 7 on  : x  ip1 such that ch(f ) = (r, , k). the fourier-

0(cid:17) on the dual 7-brane background

identied with an sl(2, zz) transformation by s =(cid:16) 0 1
be9.
mukai transform s maps this to a complex of sheaves s(f ) on cx, where b : cx  ip1 is the
dual elliptic bration. let bs be the fourier-mukai transform which maps bg, a complex of
sheaves on cx with ch(bg) = (br,b,bk), to bs(bg), a complex of sheaves on x. the chern classes

of these complexes are given by [16]

where w : h2(x, zz)  h2(cx, zz) is an automorphism induced by isomorphism between x
and cx. this automorphism is such that w(b) = b and w(f ) = f , therefore it corresponds

to a weyl transformation on the e8 root lattice, e8  h2(x, zz).

7string junctions related by branch cut moves are physically equivalent. to a given (r, , k) there corre-
sponds a family of string junctions related to each other by branch cut moves. since as shown in [44] only
the image of the complex in the k-theory group is physically relevant, this image is sucient to construct a
member of the corresponding family of string junctions. these aspects of string junctions and their relation
with derived categories is under investigation.

it is straightforward to show that js(f ) and jbs(bg) are obtained from jf and jbg respectively
by a global sl(2, zz) transformation by s =(cid:16) 0 1
0(cid:17) and branch cut moves inducing the e8
weyl transformation w. the branch cut moves, however, are dierent for js(f ) and jbs(bg)
be9, and the sign ambiguity referred to in [44, 45] is required for the proper identication

and correspond to dierent weyl transformations of ane e8 [43]. therefore we see that the
fourier-mukai transform is the s-duality transformation of the type iib 7-brane background

ruiperez for providing us with the updated version of their paper. this research was sup-
ported in part by the us department of energy under contract #de-fc02-94er40818.

8strictly speaking the junctions jf and js(f ) belong to dierent 7-brane congurations, since under s

transformation the 7-brane labels have not changed but the  parameter of the elliptic curve e has.
