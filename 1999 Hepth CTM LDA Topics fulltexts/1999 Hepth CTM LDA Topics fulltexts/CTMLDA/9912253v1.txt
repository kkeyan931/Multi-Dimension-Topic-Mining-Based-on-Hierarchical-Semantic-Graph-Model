despite of its quite dierent appearance,the modied formula denes a local and
brst invariant theory and thus ensures unitarity at least in perturbation theory.
in the presence of gribov complications, as is expected in non-perturbative yang-
mills theory, the modied formula is equivalent to the conventional formula but not
identical to it:both of the denitions give rise to non-local theory in general and
thus the unitarity is not obvious. implications of the present analysis on the lattice
regularization are briey discussed.

1 introduction

the standard gauge xing procedure of general gauge theory formulated by faddeev and
popov[1] provides a convenient framework for perturbation theory. the brst symmetry
appearing there[2] controls the slavnov-taylor identities[3] and ensures the renormaliz-
ability and unitarity. this formulation however suers from gribov complications[4] in
the non-perturbative level. the lattice formulation of gauge theory is known to intro-
duce further complications which may partly be the artifacts of lattice regularization. a
naive modication of brst invariant formulation of continuum theory[5] does not quite
resolve the basic issue of lattice regularization, as is illustrated by the no-go theorem of
neuberger[6] about the lattice implementation of brst symmetry. recently the issue
related to this last point has been partly resolved by testa[7].

a possible generalization of the faddeev-popov formula, which may provide an alterna-
tive approach to the gribov-type complications, has been proposed by zwanziger[8], and
parrinello and jona-lasinio[9]. it is known that their modied formula reduces to the con-
ventional faddeev-popov formula in a specic limit of the gauge xing parameter[8][9][10].
in the present note, we show explicitly that the modied formula is reduced to the

1

faddeev-popov formula in the absence of gribov complications if one takes into account
the motion of the gauge variable along the entire gauge orbit, without taking a specic
limit of the gauge xing parameter. we thus see that the modied formula, despite of
its quite dierent appearance, does not go beyond the faddeev-popov prescription. in
particular, the locality and unitarity is ensured by both prescriptions in the absence of
gribov complications, such as in perturbation theory. in the presence of gribov com-
plications, as is expected in non-perturbative formulation, both of the original faddeev-
popov formula and the modied formula, which are equivalent but not identical to each
other, give rise to non-local action: the validity of unitarity is thus not obvious.

in contrast, a modied brst formula[5] ensures unitarity if one assumes the asymp-
totic condition such as the lsz condition[11], but the full justication of the modied
brst formulation in the non-perturbative level is absent at this moment.

2 non-abelian gauge theory

in this note we exclusively work on the euclidean theory, and denote the local gauge
invariant action by s0(a). we start with the modied formula[8] [9]

z = z da{es0(a)r f (a)dx/z dher f (ah

)dx}
 )dx/z dher g(ah

 )dx}

= z da

{es0(a

 )r g(a

h.we also dened

which satises g(a

)  0, where the variable a0

 is dened by

g(a

)  f (a

)  f (a0
 )

minf (a

) = f (a0

 ).

namely, 0(x) is the value of the gauge orbit parameter (x) which gives rise to the
minimum value of f (a
) at each point of the space-time. we may generally assume
f (a
) > 0 (or more generally, bounded from below) to ensure the convergence of the
path integral in the denominator in (2.1). by denition we have

 z f (a

 )dx = z dx
= z dx

= 0.

(2.5)

we understand that the absence of gribov complications implies that eq.(2.5) has a
unique solution 0(x) for each gauge orbit.in this case, eq.(2.3) also has a unique solution
0(x): otherwise, we nd multiple solutions for (2.4) by choosing (x) as a -functionally
peaked function at such a space-time point.

we next re-write the partition function z as

z = z da

 ))2 = g(a

with (g(a
 ). in the second expression of (2.6) (x) is a generic gauge orbit
parameter in the innitesimal neighborhood of 0(x), and h(x) is a generic gauge param-
eter in the innitesimal neighborhood of the unit element. here we used the fact that we
can bring the relation

to

g(a

 )  2 = 0

g(a

 ) = 0

(2.8)

(2.9)

by choosing a suitable gauge parameter (x) for an arbitrary (x) in the absence of
gribov complications.in fact,(x) = 0(x) in the absence of gribov complications. this
statement is established by noting that we can compensate any variation of (x) by a
suitable change of the gauge orbit parameter (x) as

g(a
 )
(x)

(x) =

f (a
 )
(x)

(x) = 2(x)

because

f (a

(2.11)

) is unbounded from above, since otherwise the path integral r dher g(ah

for (x) 6= 0(x) in the absence of gribov complications. by a repeated application of
innitesimal gauge transformations, we can thus satisfy the relation (2.9). we also note
 )dx
that g(a
diverges in the dening path integral. we emphasize that we use the generic parameter
(x) = 0(x) + (x) as the gauge parameter for the integration variable da
 in the
second expression of (2.6); this fact is important to avoid the appearance of non-trivial
jacobian which generally arises when we change the path integral variable, which satises
precisely (g(a
 )). we are considering the functional space of the gauge
parameter, and the procedure in (2.6) corresponds to a shift of the origin of the functional

we thus nally write the partition function (2.6) after the path integration over  and

we emphasize that the limiting expression (2.13)is used as a compact parametrization of
the -function, and the relation (2.12) itself is established without taking any limit in the
gauge xing parameter.

we thus obtain

positive denite operator in the absence of gribov complications: we can thus dene o
in (2.18) as an operator whose eigenvalues are given by the square root of the eigenvalues
of o and still proportional to (x  y).

we also have

(2.24)

for a rather general class of gauge xing function f (a).we here write the gauge index
explicitly. this brst symmetry itself holds even before the eld re-denition in (2.21),
since the eld re-denition (2.22) is consistent with brst symmetry. eq.(2.23) is the
main result of the present note.

so far we assumed the absence of gribov complications, and thus the arguments
are applicable to perturbation theory.
in the presence of gribov complications, as is
expected in non-perturbative formulation, the analysis becomes more complicated. we
here understand the gribov complications as simply meaning the appearance of multiple
solutions of

 z f (a

 )dx = 0

(2.25)

at (x) = k(x), k = 1, 2, ..., n.we also assume that these k(x) are globally dened in
the entire space-time.

in the presence of gribov complications, we cannot make a denite statement. in the
following, we briey sketch how one can transform (2.1) to an expression which is as local
as possible; this may be relevant for the analysis of the issues related to unitarity. in the
modied path integral formula[8] [9], the local minimum solutions of (2.25) correspond
to the so-called gribov copies. the local maximum solutions of (2.25) correspond to the
so-called gribov horizons, namely, the obstruction in the analysis of (2.10). we can then
still arrive at the second expression in (2.6), but now 0(x) stands for one of those k(x)
which give the local minima of f (a). for these solutions , the operator in (2.17) is
considered as a positive operator. we thus obtain

as follows: consider f (x)  f (x0) + f (x0)(x x0) + 1
2! f (x0)(x x0)2 with f (x0) =
f (x0) = 0 and f (x0) > 0. we then have f (x) = pf (x0)/2(xx0) and ( f (x))  (pf (x0)(xx0))

where the integration variable ak
 and the variable inside the action and the -functional

on the other hand, the conventional faddeev-popov formula gives ( by remembering

that the -function is by denition positive)

where the summation is over all the solutions of (2.25).

both of the formulas (2.26) and (2.27) give rise to a positive denite integrand in
euclidean theory, but not quite identical to each other. (we note that (2.26) and (2.27)
are identical in the absence of gribov copies.) however, they are equivalent to each other
in the sense that both are dened by extracting the gauge volume element from the naive
path integral measure da. both formulas give rise to non-local theory, and thus the
unitarity is not obvious.
in contrast, the brst invariant ansatz suggested in ref.[5] corresponds to a local

brst invariant expression

gauge eld congurations. the brst symmetry combined with the asymptotic condition
such as the lsz prescription denes a unitary theory. we emphasize that the lagrangian
for the faddeev-popov ghosts in (2.28) is not degenerate in general with respect to the
degenerate solutions of d( f (a

) = 0;consequently, the asymptotic condition such as
a

the lsz condition may well pick up a unique asymptotic eld a despite the presence of
the gribov copies.(in pure yang-mills theory without the higgs mechanism, we expect
the gluon connement and thus the asymptotic condition may be replaced by the use of
a wilson loop, for example).

4 conclusion

we have shown explicitly the equivalence of the modied path integral formula[8][9] to
the conventional faddeev-popov formula[1] without taking any limit of the gauge xing
parameter, if the gribov complications are absent. in the presence of gribov complica-
tions, these two formulas are equivalent but not identical to each other, and both give
rise to non-local theory in general and thus the unitarity is not obvious.

10

from a view point of non-perturbative denition of gauge theory, a brst invariant
formulation of lattice gauge theory is important[13]. the neubergers stricture in the
brst invariant lattice formulation[6] corresponds to the appearance of an even number
of copies with alternating signature of det{ 
)]} due to the periodicity of lattice
gauge variables, and thus (when we use the continuum notation in (2.28))

 )

(4.1)

the recent analysis by testa[7] suggests that the brst invariant ansatz[5] can be imple-
mented for abelian theory and also for the abelian projection of non-abelian theory by a
suitable generalization of the -function on the lattice. it remains an interesting problem
to extend the analysis of testa to fully non-abelian lattice theory which may eventually
overcome the neubergers stricture.

as for the practical implications of the present continuum analysis on the lattice sim-
ulation, it may be important to remember that the gauge xing by adding an (eective)
mass term to the lattice action [13] may not go beyond the conventional faddeev-popov
procedure if one accounts the variation of the gauge variable along the entire gauge or-
bit. this property will be important when one analyzes the issues related to unitarity. it
should also be emphasized that both of the original faddeev-popov formula and the modi-
ed one give rise to a positive denite integrand in the path integral even on the lattice[13].

the present note was motivated by the discussions at the riken-bnl workshop,
may 25-29, 99 and at the nato advanced research workshop at dubna, october 5-9,
99. one of the authors (kf) thanks all the participants of those workshops for stimulating
discussions.
