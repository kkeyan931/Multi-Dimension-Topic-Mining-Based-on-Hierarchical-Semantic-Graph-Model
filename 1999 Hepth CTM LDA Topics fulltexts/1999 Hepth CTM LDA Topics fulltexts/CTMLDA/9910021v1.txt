abstract

we explain that supersymmetric attractors in general have several critical points due
to the algebraic nature of the stabilization equations. we show that the critical values
of the cosmological constant of the ads5 vacua are given by the topological (moduli
independent) formulae analogous to the entropy of the d=5 supersymmetric black
holes. we present conditions under which more than one critical point is available
(for black hole entropy as well as to the cosmological constant) so that the system
tends to its own locally stable attractor point. we have found several families of z2-
symmetric critical points of ads5 throat which may be associated with the vanishing
d=4 cosmological constant.

1. the concept of supersymmetric attractors with respect to black hole entropy was
introduced in [1]. the so-called stabilization equations [2, 3] for the behaviour of the moduli
near the charged extremal black holes horizon have been studied extensively during the last few
years. it has been established that the supersymmetric xed points of the theory correspond to
the minimum of the central charge1 in the physical part of the moduli space, when the metric is
positive denite [4].

the issue of uniqueness of the basin of attraction of the supersymmetric systems related
to calabi yau black holes of ungauged supergravity [5] and cosmological constant in d=5 gauged
supergravity [5] was raised in [6]. it was emphasized in [7] that one may look for more than
one basin of attraction in the context of the black hole xed points. the situation however was
not resolved in general: on one hand one may expect that the black hole with the given electric
and magnetic charges in the theory with compactication on particular cy space have a unique
entropy, on the other hand the stabilization equations [3, 8, 6]

(1)

being algebraic equations may lead to multiple solutions2. the reason is that one starts with
the system of n quadratic equations for n variables ti. they can be reduced to some higher
order algebraic equation for each xed moduli. for example, in case i = 1, 2 one has to solve
quadratic equations which have 2 solutions, etc.

recent developments with ads/cft correspondence [9] and bps domain walls [10, 11,
12] stimulated us to clarify the situation with the multiple basins of attraction for supersymmetric
d=5 cy black holes as well as for the cosmological constant of ads5 space.

the reason why these two completely dierent phenomena may be treated simultaneously
was explained in [6]. to nd the black hole entropy we are looking for the supersymmetric
critical points of the black hole potential [4] which for d=5 ungauged n=2 supergravity is given
2gijizjz. here the central charge z = tiqi depends on real moduli ti and on
by v = z 2 + 3
electric charges of the black hole qi . the supersymmetric critical points are at z,i = 0, where
iv = 4z iz  6 tijkjzkz = 0, where tijk is a function of moduli and cijk. at the

supersymmetric critical point of the central charge which is also a supersymmetric critical point
of the black hole potential the value of the potential denes the bps mass and the black hole
entropy:

m 2

bp s = |z|2,

(m 2

bp s)crit = |z|2

crit(cijk, qi) = |vcrit| at z,i = 0.

(2)

in the supersymmetric critical points the second derivative of the black hole potential
is proportional to the metric on the moduli space: v,i;j = 8
3gijvcr at iv = iz = 0. for the
positive moduli space metric the potential v has a local minimum whenever the stabilization
equation has a solution with non-vanishing central charge. when the potential is non-zero at

1the world central charge here is used for the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra as explained in [3]
2we use the notations of [6] where v  ci jk titj tk = 1 and n elds ti , i = 1, . . . , n are functions of n  1

independent moduli i, i = 1, . . . , n  1.

now consider the supersymmetric critical points of the potential of the u(1) gauged n=2
d=5 supergravity. the size of the ads5 throat is dened by the extrema of the gauged super-
4gijizjz.
gravity potential [5, 6]. the relevant potential is equal to 6g2p , where p = z 2  3
in the context of gauged supergravity the central charge z is a moduli dependent combination of
gravitino and gaugino charges v i which is dened by z = tivi, where vi is the charge dening
the gravitino-gravitino-vector and gaugino-gaugino-vector interactions. the critical points of the

p are given by ip = z iz +q3/2 tijkjzkz = 0, and as before the supersymmetric critical

points of the central charge are also the supersymmetric critical points of the potential. the
value of the potential p at the critical point is dened the bps mass as a function of cijk and
vi.

bp s = |z|2,

crit(cijk, vi) = |pcrit| at z,i = 0.

the ads5 vacua are solutions of this theory with unbroken supersymmetry. the cosmological
constant of the relevant ads5 space coincides with the critical value of the bps mass extremized
in the moduli space. at the supersymmetric critical points, where z,i = 0, one nds

ads5 = 6g2|tivi|2 = 6g2|zcr(vi, cijk)|2 = 6g2m 2

z,i = 0.

(5)

in the supersymmetric critical points the second derivative of the potential is proportional to
the metric on the moduli space: (p ),i;j = iip =  2
3 gij(z 2)cr at ip = iz = 0. for
the positive moduli space metric the potential p has a maximum whenever the stabilization
equation has a solution. when the potential is non-zero at the critical point, it denes the
cosmological constant. thus, as explained in sec. 4.2 of [6] the critical points of the bps mass
of ungauged supergravity depending on the electric charges of the black hole solutions qi have to
be replaced by the gravitino-gaugino charges (fi terms) vi to nd the critical points of the bps
mass of the gauged theory. in ungauged theory one nds the black hole entropy from the bps
mass, in the gauged theory one nds the cosmological constant. thus as a function of gravitino
charges vi and cy intersection numbers cijk, the cosmological constant at the supersymmetric
critical point is given by the same topological formula which denes the entropy of the extreme
supersymmetric black holes: the value of the cosmological constant is moduli independent and
depends only on vi and cijk.

thus all previous studies of cy black hole entropy may be used for understanding the
in what follows we will focus our attention on the issue of non-uniqueness of

ads5 vacua.
supersymmetric critical points of this theory.

simultaneously with the study of the critical points of the central charge, one has to
verify that at the given critical point some natural physical conditions are satised. we will
try to nd xed points where both the metric of the moduli space gij = 3cijkti tj
,k and the
metric of the vector space (the gauge coupling matrix) gij = i j (lnv)|v =1 are positive.

in some cases these conditions are sucient to guarantee the uniqueness of the critical
point for the black hole entropy 3. such cases give examples of supersymmetric attractors with
one basin of attraction.

in some other cases specied by dierent values of the intersection numbers cijk and
charges qi or vi more than one critical point satisfying conditions i, ii may be available. par-
ticularly in the case of many moduli when the stabilization equations are higher order algebraic
equations, one may expect to nd several critical points consistent with physical requirements.
in what follows we will present conditions for multi basin attractors, give examples and discuss
the conceptual issues associated with such systems.

we start with an example for i = 1, 2 when the algebraic system common for d=4 and
d=5 theories has a general solution describing d=4 and d=5 black holes and ads5 vacua. in
this example the issue of the uniqueness of the d=4 black hole entropy and the possibility of the
non-uniqueness of the entropy of d=5 black holes and the critical points of the ads5 vacua will
be claried. one may hope to learn some lessons from this simple system which may help to
understand the theories with many moduli.

2. stabilization equations for i = 1, 2 and generic cijk and vi. we choose

(6)
and denote t1  x and t2  y. the stabilization equations consist of the system of two quadratic
equations for two variables:

c111 = a , c112 = b , c122 = c , c222 = d ,

ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = v1 ,
bx2 + 2cxy + dy2 = v2 .

we introduce the following notations4

n  b2  ac ,

l  ad  bc ,

and

d  (mv 2

3for d=4 cy black holes in two moduli case i = 1, 2 the uniqueness of the critical point consistent with the

requirement that the moduli space metric is positive was proved in [13]

4we assume that m 6= 0 and l2 6= 4m n .

respectively.

the metric of the moduli space is required to be positive everywhere in the moduli space.

this leads to a requirement that

l2  4mn < 0 ,
it follows from the fact that the expression

m > 0 ,

n > 0 ,

mz2  lz + n > 0

(13)

(14)

has to be positive for all values of real z = y
x. this is a natural condition for the physical theory
without tachyons. in addition it provides the condition that the critical points are local minima
of the black hole potential and local maxima of the gauge theory potential.

and (xy) and y2

(21)

here again we see that it is consistent to have z+ < 0 and z > 0 for the two critical
points. for the cosmological constant case there is an analogous expression for the central charge
in terms of vi instead of qi .

the critical values of the black hole entropy and the critical values of the cosmolog-
ical constant are given by the analogous formulae. by substitution of the critical values of
x2
, xy we get two critical values of the central charge, entropy and cosmological constant:

now we have to study the values of vector space metric gij (gauge couplings) at the
critical points. a tedious calculation analogous to that performed in [13] with respect to d=4
black holes and moduli metric allows to nd the generic expression for the determinant of the
gauge coupling matrix at the critical point.

(det gij ) =

for m > 0 .

(24)

for black holes z = q1x + q2y and for the cosmological constant it equals z = v1x + v2y.

now we see that one may be able to justify the existence of both critical points as possibly
acceptable under the following conditions: we have to require that at the + critical point the
critical value of the central charge z is negative and at the - critical point the critical value of
the central charge z is positive. in such case the determinant of gauge couplings is positive at
both critical points. but this is precisely the condition obtained from the consistent solution of
the attractor equations as shown in (20)! in such cases the determinant of the gauge coupling
matrix is positive at both critical points.

note that we still have to nd out whether the eigenvalues of gij are actually positive.
it may happen that the determinant is positive but the eigenvalues are both negative. we can
not at this stage provide a generic answer to this problem. in each individual example we have
to verify that even if the conditions on the metric of the moduli space (13) as well as that on
det g in eqs.(24) are satised, the eigenvalues of the gauge coupling constants are positive. only
if this nal condition is satised, one can claim that there are two critical points which form the
stable local minima for the entropy (maxima for the gauge potential).

6

thus we have shown that generically there are conditions under which two critical points
are possible. one can give some numerical examples when these conditions are satised. one of
the examples is presented in [11]. typically the values of the entropy and of the ads5 throat are
dierent in two dierent critical points.

the conditions for more than one basin of attraction can be easily violated, in which
case the system has only one attractor point. for example we may have some cijk and qi for
which either the solution is unique or at both critical points the central charge has the same
sign. this would mean that one of the critical point is unstable to the generation of vector elds
and has to be excluded.

very interesting question here also is:

is the solution with z+ < 0 and z > 0 and

|z+| = |z| possible? the equation for our parameters specifying this case is:

a  v2(dv 2

1 + bv 2

2  2cv1v2) + d" f l + 2em

(l2  4mn)# = 0 .

(25)

we have found 3 families of solutions for such congurations. we take a following set of
parameters a = 0, b = 1/3, d = 1, v1 = 1 and we do not specify c and v2. equation a = 0 has
2[c  9c2  4]. we have veried that in all
a solution under condition that v2 = 3
cases there exist a broad continuous range of parameters for which the physical conditions are
satised. for example, a = 0, b = 1/3, c = 4/3, d = 1, v1 = 1, v2 = 2 gives a consistent set.

2c or v2 = 3

3. we would like to point out that the existence of several basins of attraction in dy-
namical systems in general is quite common. typically the system is attracted to the nearest
attractor point after it reaches a given basin of attraction. the way things work with super-
symmetric attractors is close to this situation. in d=5 theory with one independent moduli the
existence of 2 local extrema of the black hole and gauged supergravity potentials for positive
metric means that the metric can not be continuous. this discontinuity explains the existence
of several basins of attraction. it has been pointed out in [11] in the context of the bps domain
walls that between the critical points of the cosmological constants the metric has a pole. in
general for i = 1, 2 the singularities of the moduli space metric are given by the solution of the
equation

a + 3bz + 3cz2 + dz3 = 0

(26)

here z = y
x . some values of z = zw which solve equation (26) must be between y+/x+ and
y/x to provide 2 local extrema of the potential. therefore the system may be at some initial
value of a moduli either from one side of the discontinuity of the moduli space metric or on the
other side. this gives a precise denition of the basin of attraction. note that the value of the
entropy (or the value of the cosmological constant) in general is dierent for two critical points
under discussion. for example for the entropy dierence we have

7

a + 2

 s = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

d3/2

(l2  4mn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

d3/2

(l2  4mn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(27)

the dierence means that the black hole entropy takes dierent values in two attractors. the
systems however has no way to proceed to the lowest possible value of the potential, it can only
move in the direction to the nearest attractor point (which we call its own attractor) since being
in a given basin means that the other one is behind the innity of the metric of the moduli space,
i.e. behind the wall. thus contrary to the physical intuition which suggest that the entropy of
the system with a given prepotential and given charges is unique we nd that the initial values of
the moduli may specify the attractor point and allow the entropy (or the cosmological constant)
to be not unique. the standard assumption about the unique lowest possible energy state does
not apply here.

an interesting comment can be made about the properties of the excitations around the
two gauged theory vacua. the gravitino mass near one critical point is positive mgrav = z > 0
and the one near the second critical point is negative m+grav = z +  < 0 since its value at
each critical point is the value of the central charge. the issue of the positive versus negative
fermion mass in d=5 was discussed in [14] where it was noticed that the positive mass theory
and the negative mass theory both may exists. the relations between these theories include a
change of  matrices into  as well as of the representation of the little part so(4) of the
lorentz group. interestingly, we need both versions of the theory to make acceptable not only
the vacuum state but also the excitations around each vacua.

with respect to black holes our analysis seems to develop and conrm the idea suggested
by moore [7] that the black holes (in d=5 under some conditions specied in this paper) may
represent a multiple attractor system. to specify a black hole one has to specify not only the
charges and the prepotential but also the attractor point, dened by the values of moduli at
some distance from the horizon.

we have shown that the critical points for the cosmological constant correspond to a
multiple attractor system. more has to be understood with respect to domain walls. in particular
it would be interesting to understand whether the system may jump from one attractor point to
the other one as it happens sometimes in dynamical systems at particular values of the control
parameter. as we have already stressed our critical points are the locally stable maxima of the
potential but globally some instability may occur which changes the behaviour of the system
dramatically.

one of the most interesting issues is related to the z2 symmetric bps critical points with
equal values of the ads5 radius found in this paper. according to [15, 11] they may be related to
the vanishing of a cosmological constant in the four dimensional space-time. for the same type
of critical points with a = 0 the entropy in two critical points is the same, as follows from eq.
(27).

one nal remark. the lesson we learned here was about d=5 one-moduli theory and its

8

double attractor system. it means that in d=4 as well as in d=5 in cases with several moduli one
may nd some acceptable from the physical point of view congurations with a multiple basins
of attraction. such theories is more dicult to study for arbitrary values of the intersection
numbers and charges, however it is plausible that several basins of attraction may be found.
