abstract

the general correlator of composite operators of n = 4 supersymmetric gauge eld the-
ory is divergent. we introduce a means for renormalizing these correlators by adding a
boundary theory on the ads space correcting for the divergences. such renormalizations
are not equivalent to the standard normal ordering of current algebras in two dimensions.
the correlators contain contact terms that contribute to the ope; we relate them diagram-
matically to correlation functions of compound composite operators dual to multi-particle
states.

1 introduction

recently much progress has been made in the understanding of superconformal n = 4
super yang-mills theories through a holographic description in terms of a iib string (m-)
theory on an anti-de sitter background [1, 2, 3]. the low energy eective supergravity of the
string theory probes the strong coupling limit of the cft at large nc; stringy/string-loop
corrections correspond to the expansion in inverse powers of the t hooft eective coupling
g2
y m nc and nc. an explicit example is the correspondence between type iib supergravity
on ads5  s5 and n = 4 super-yang-mills. correlation functions in the latter at large nc
may be determined from the supergravity theory through the relation:

k

yj=1  



0,j(~zj)! eissugra[(0)](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0,j =0

k

= h

yj=1oj(~zj)icf t .

(1.1)

here, ssugra is the bulk action of the supergravity theory considered as a functional of the
boundary values of the elds, 0,j, and o are composite (gauge invariant) operators of
the conformal yang-mills theory. these operators are dual to the boundary values of the
supergravity elds in the sense that the latter act as sources for the former. in recent months
cft correlation functions have been analyzed using the holographic prescription [4]-[20].

in calculations exploring the correspondence, one item which has been little addressed is
the fact that the correlations of composite operators are in general divergent. for example
the fourier transform of two-point functions of scalar operators o(~x),

ho(~x1)o(~x2)i =
ho(~k)o(~k)i =

1

|~x1  ~x2|2 
2dd/2(d/2  )

()

~k2(d/2+) ,

(1.2)

is ill-dened whenever the dimension  of the operators is greater than d/2. for a consistent
description of the correspondence one needs to provide a regularization of these short-distance
singularities to make the theory nite. this issue has been briey mentioned in [3]. we
introduce here a modication of the ads/cft correspondence through the addition of a
boundary action, as a consequence of which the correlators are made nite. a dierent set
of boundary terms were considered in [12].

contact contributions to correlation functions appear in the explicit evaluation of three-
and four-point functions. their fourier transformed k-space expressions are divergent but
they also produce logarithms in the kinematic invariants; they contain cuts. the purpose
of this work is to focus on coincident points, both how they relate to the regulating of
divergences and the appearance of contact terms in the calculation of correlation functions
with physical implications. we suggest that the resolution is related to the role of additional
predicted states in the ads/cft correspondence.

a regulatory scheme is to compute greens functions at points innitesimally away from
the boundary. by introducing counterterms with the associated scale we are in eect renor-
malizing the cft through the ads boundary theory. of course this violates conformal
invariance. however, the prescription of [2, 3] considers not the cft as such but its pertur-
bation by conformal operators,

sn =4 sy m  sn =4 sy m +z d4~x0,j(~x)oj(~x) ,

(1.3)

where the source of the operator is the boundary value of a supergravity eld.

conformal symmetry protects the dimensions of chiral primary operators and their de-
scendants. thus for those operators the introduction of a regulator in intermediate steps of
the calculation will not aect the nal answer provided one keeps the operator insertions at
distinct points [3, 4, 5]. however, correlations of multiple operators may still diverge at short
distances and these require the introduction of counterterms [21]. this is in contrast to the
niteness of the unperturbed cft. the counterterms are related to products of conformal
operators at the same point. these compound composite operators, e.g. : trf 2(~x)trf 2(~x) :,
are neither primary nor descendants [22]. as we will see such product operators are dual to
multi-particle supergravity states.

in [19] and [20] there has been some speculation on where such states might appear in
exchange diagrams between elementary supergravity elds. here we nd in addition to the
regularisation and renormalization of the ads theory terms related to their existence. the
four-point function contains a contact term of the following form

ho(~x1)o(~x2)o(~x3)o(~x4)i = n 2(d)(~x1  ~x2)

1

|~x1  ~x3|p (d)(~x3  ~x4) + permutations , (1.4)

together with products of multiple delta functions. the delta functions predict this correlator
to be related to the two-point function of the conformal operator :o(~x)o(~x) :, dual to a multi-
particle supergravity state. specic multi-particle states were found to be necessary in the
ads/cft correspondence in [23, 24].

the outline of this work is as follows. in section 2 we recall how conformal transformations
constrain the form of correlators at distinct points.
in section 3 we review the greens
functions used in the computations and examine the asymptotic forms necessary for the
analysis of the contact-terms. in section 4 we examine the divergences within the correlators
by starting with a simple analysis of the two-point functions. our testing ground will be
the dilaton-axion sector of iib supergravity on ads5  s5. in sections 5 and 6 we do the
same for three- and four-point functions. we discuss the relation to multi-particle states in
section 7. we support this by modeling contact term contributions as coming from bulk ads
multi-loop supergravity. lastly, in section 8 we discuss implications and extensions related
to this work.

2 conformal invariance constraints

in this section we briey review the constraints imposed by conformal transformations on
correlation functions of conformal operators.

conformal transformations preserve the line element up to a scale factor:

x  x

(x)

dxdx = 2(x)dxdx .

in d dimensions they make up the conformal group so(d, 2) generated by rotations,

x
 = r

x

r1

r2 = 12 ,  = 1

scale transformations,

x
 = x

2 = 2 ,

and special conformal transformations,

x

 = 1(x)hx + vx2i

(x) = 1 + 2v  x + v2x2 .

alternatively we may use inversion,

x
 =

x
x2

(x) = x2 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

instead of the special conformal transformations to build up the generators of the group.

conformal operators oi of scale dimension  transform as

t  oi = di

j [r]oj .

(2.6)

this means that the correlator of two such operators must behave under an inversion as

ho( ~z1)o( ~z1)i 

1

|~z1  ~z2|2 

1
|~z
1  ~z

2|2 = (z1)(z2)

1

|~z1  ~z2|2 .

(2.7)

at coincident points, however, these transformations are singular. conformal invariance
constrains the correlators only when the points of the operators are at distinct separated
values. potential contact terms in the correlator are allowed and probe the short-distance
structure (uv region) of the conformal eld theory. as an example consider free-eld qcd
greens functions which are conformally invariant at non-coincident points [25]. only when
we investigate the short-distance behaviour and compensate for innities by the introduction
of counterterms do we nd scale dependence. note that there are no uv non-renormalization
theorems for correlations of composite operators in n = 4 super yang-mills theory, the
reason being that they are not nite.

3 asymptotic form of greens functions

in this section we examine the relevant limits of the bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary kernels
necessary for an exact evaluation of the contact contributions to the multi-point correlation
functions examined in later sections. the theory we consider is the dilaton-axion sector of
iib supergravity on ads5  s5 with action

s =

1

22 z d5xqg(x)(r + 12/a2) + gh + e2cci

(3.1)

note that the interaction between the dilaton and axion contains derivatives. for the back-
ground metric on ads5 we will use the half-space poincare metric

ds2 =

a2
x2

0 (cid:16)dx2

0 + dxidxjij(cid:17) ,

i = 1, ..., d

(3.2)

where x0  0. we set the ads radius a2 to unity in the remainder and we will keep the
dimension d = 4 abstract whenever possible. the metric ij is minkowski with mostly plus
signature, and dd = 1.

the bulk-bulk correlator for massive scalars is given by

h(x)(y)i  g(x, y)

ddk

= (x0y0)d/2z 
where  = qm2 + d2/4 > 0 and ~k  ~x  pd

dz
i=1 kixi. we denote with ~x a (minkowski) four-
vector on the boundary of ads. the i prescription was provided in [18]. as the dilaton and
axion are massless we shall consider this case in the remainder of this work.
the bulk-boundary kernel (~x, y) is found by taking the small y0 limit,

(2)d ei~k(~x~y) j(x0)j(y0)
2 + ~k2  i

,

(3.3)

(~y, z) = lim

(3.5)

the extra factor of y
corrects for the asymptotic behaviour of the greens function. to
0
evaluate this limit we need the asymptotic behaviour of the bessel functions. at z  0 they
behave as

j(z) =

z(cid:19)

k(z) =

(3.6)

and at z   we have,
j(z) = (cid:18) 1
2z(cid:19)

cos(z + /2) + . . .

k(z) = (cid:18)

(3.8)

(3.9)

this kernel satises the appropriate dirichlet boundary conditions, as may be veried. ex-
plicit integration over the fourier modes ~k gives the position-space form,

(~y, z) =

d/2(d/2)  

z0

0 + (~y  ~z)2!d

z2

(3.10)

(3.13)

(3.14)

the dirichlet conditions on the bulk-boundary kernel may also be veried using the distri-
butional form above,

and a related useful identity is

lim
z00

(~y, z) = d(~y  ~z) ,

lim
z00

z0z0(~y, z) = d(d)(~y  ~z) .

(3.11)

(3.12)

in the following we will also need the small z0 limit of the derivative of the bulk-boundary

kernel,

f (~y, ~z) = lim
straightforward dierentiation of (3.9) gives,

z00

(~y  ~z)2
0 + (~y  ~z)2]d+1) .

[z2

the functional form of the limit does not permit a naive interpretation as a distribution,
and we need to include a divergent coecient. the limits of (3.14) are:

and

~y  ~z 6= 0

: f (~y, ~z) =

(d + 1)
d/2(d/2)

1

(~y  ~z)2d ,

~y  ~z = 0

: f (~y, ~z) = 

(d + 1)
d/2(d/2)

1
y2d
0

.

we dene the z0  0 form of (3.14) to be

lim
z00

1

zd1
0

z0(~y, z) =

(d + 1)

d/2(d/2) (

1

(~y  ~z)2d 

1

d (~y  ~z)) .

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

the coecient  may be regarded as an innitesimal distance from the boundary at z0 = 0;
this can be explicitly veried by evaluating (3.13) using the momentum space formulation
of the bulk-boundary kernel.

5

4 two-point functions

conformal invariance xes the form of the two-point function of chiral primary operators
with dimension , the bosonic form of which is,

ho1(~z1)o2(~z2)i =

12

|~z1  ~z2|1+2

,

(4.1)

provided the points are kept distinct. correlators of descendents easily follow. this two-point
function is computed through the holographic correspondence by solving for the boundary-
boundary kernel between two dierent points on the boundary of the anti-de sitter com-
pactication and integrating over a two-point insertion in the bulk.
the fourier transform of the general two-point correlator (4.1)

ho1(~k)o2(~k)i = 12

2dd/2(d/2  )

()

~k2(d/2+) ,

(4.2)

is divergent and must be regularized. this is not an ad hoc requirement, but follows directly
from, for instance, the free-eld evaluation of the two-point function of the operator trij
in n = 4 super yang-mills theory. in this example, the contribution is a one-loop self-energy
graph whose divergence equals that of (4.2).

the necessity of introducing a regulating scale may be considered as a conformal anomaly
[2] in the n = 4 theory. this resembles the naive scale dependence in the tree-level bosonic
propagator hx(z)x(v)i  ln(z  v) in open (or closed) string theory. the value of the
composite two-point correlator at coincident points is not determined through conformal
invariance but suers from operator product ambiguities and associated divergences. string-
theory, or more precisely two-dimensional conformal eld theories, are special in that power
counting shows that only two-point functions are divergent, and subtracting the contact
term there xes it for all higher point functions as well. in n = 4 super yang-mills theory
we nd that there are further modications of higher-point functions.

we will add to the two-point correlator a counterterm that eliminates the pathology at
short distance. in x-space counterterms are known to be provided in the form of distributions
with support at coincident points. such regularizations and renormalizations have been
extensively studied in the dierential regularization approach [25]. we shall modify the
two-point function to the following form,

ho1(~z1)o2(~z2)i =

12

|~z1  ~z2|1+2

+ 2d2nn(d)(~z1  ~z2) ,

(4.3)

where n =   d/2 is the integer part of   d/2.  is a dimensionful regulating scale
that permits the counterterm to be built out of operators with well-dened classical scaling
dimensions: n, where n is an integer.

6

the coecient  is determined by enforcing niteness on the fourier transformed two-
point correlator, and is divergent. with the addition of the counterterm and after dimen-
sional continuation the fourier transform of (4.3) yields

ho1(~k1)o2(~k2)i = (2)d(d)(~k1 + ~k2)

2dd/2
()

12

k6n (cid:16)1 + 2 ln(~k2/2)(cid:17) .

(4.4)

and is nite. the above follows from minimal subtraction with   1/(  d/2  n). all
of the two-point functions may be regularised in this manner. the renormalization scale 
may be thought of as an innitesimal distance from the boundary of ads.

rather than modifying the correlation functions by adding contact terms by hand, we
add a boundary action with these counterterms to the bulk anti-de sitter supergravity.
boundary term additions have been considered before within the purely gravitational anti-
de sitter action, with the addition of the gibbons-hawking term [3, 6, 4] and in the work
of [12]. in our case we include the boundary term,

sb.t. =


2

2d2nz ddx 0(x)n0(x) ,

(4.5)

where the boundary values of the supergravity elds, 0(~x) are dual to the composite elds
o(~x). the functional variation of (4.5),





0(~z1)

0(~z2)

sb.t. = 2d2nz dd~x (d)(~z1  ~x)n

x(d)(~z2  ~x) ,

(4.6)

reproduces the counterterm in (4.3). this is exactly the procedure of composite operator
renormalization in the cft. in this case, since the two-point function is given to all orderes
by its free-eld value, this can be explicitly veried. the perturbed cft,

sn =4 sy m  sn =4 sy m +z d4~xjj(~x)oj(~x) ,

(4.7)

requires counterterms consisting of all operators o of similar dimension or less. in particular
graphs with no external fundamental elds will require counterterms formed by products j n
11 . in the ads/cft correspondence the sources j are the boundary values of supergravity
elds.

for two-point functions of correlators of operators corresponding to the dilaton and the
axion we have  = d and n = d/2. in this case the constants  and 1 and 2 are explicitly

 =

(1)n
n!

1

d/2  n

, 1 =

3(1)n
2n!

, 2 =

(1)n
n!

.

(4.8)

similar terms occur for the boundary values of all the other supergravity elds.

7

5 three-point functions

we next analyze how similar divergent behaviour of the three-point functions can be com-
pensated by adding additional interaction terms on the boundary of the anti-de sitter space.
we will examine the correlator htrf f (~x1)trf f (~x2)trf 2(~x3)i whose supergravity dual is the
unamputated hc(~x1)c(~x2)(~x3)i amplitude. it arises within the ads/cft correspondence
by considering the contributions from the cc vertex,

scc =

1

22 z dd+1x qg(x)gcc ,

(5.1)

where g(x) is the background anti-de sitter metric, eq. (3.2). the value of the correlator
is computed through the use of the bulk-boundary kernel to be,

acc(~x1, ~x2, ~x3) =

1

2 z dd+1yqg(y)(~x3, y)g(y)

 (~x1, y)(y)

 (~x2, y) ,

which through a partial integration may be expressed as

acc(~x1, ~x2, ~x3) =

1

22 z dd~y

1

yd1
0

h(1y02)3  12y03iy0=

y0=0

.

(5.2)

(5.3)

here the parenthesis, (12), denote symmetrization, a(1b2) = a1b2 + a2b1. the bulk term
vanishes due to the fact that the bulk-boundary kernel in (3.9) solves laplaces equation.
we have used the shorthand i = (~xi, y).
inserting the kernels and the limits from section 3 we obtain two types of contributions
to the three-point function, a = a(2) + a(3), distinguished by the number of delta functions
present. we set the gravitational coupling  to unity from here on. the form a(2) contributes
at doubly coincident points ~xi,

(5.4)

(5.5)

the fact that this three-point function only contains contact terms is in accordance with
previous results [5, 11].

8

the presence of delta functions means that the ope contains these additional contact
terms. we relate these contact terms to the contributions from new composite operators
in the theory. for example, the delta functions in a(2) suggest in (5.4) a relation with the

two-point correlators htrf 2(~z1)htrf f (~z2)i2

i and hhtrf 2(~z1)trf f (~z1)i trf f (~z2)i. they
involve new composites: trf f trf f (~z) and trf 2trf f (~z). such composites are not de-
scendents of chiral primary operators (in general a product of descendants of cpos is not
the descendent of another chiral primary operator). their dimensions are therefore not pro-
tected and such operators may renormalize. we nd in section 7 that the ads duals of such
operators are multi-particle supergravity states.

to have a well-dened fourier transform for the expressions in a(2) we add the boundary

action

bdy,cc = z dd~x c(~x)c(~x)k+2(~x) + c(~x)k+2c(~x)(~x) + k+2c(~x)c(~x)(~x) . (5.6)
s(2)
setting  to the same value as in eq.(4.8) the divergence in the three-point correlator a(2)
cc
is nullied. we may also include a counterterm of the form

s(3)
bdy,cc =



d z dd~x c(~x)c(~x)(~x) ,

(5.7)

to eliminate the contribution in a(3)

cc, with  determined from (5.5).

6 four-point functions

four-point correlation functions have the new feature that there are two types of holographic
feynman diagrams to analyze: the one built from two three-point bulk vertices exchanging
an intermediate supergravity eld and the contribution from a bulk four-point vertex. scalar
exchange contributions to the rst diagram have been analyzed several times [20, 13, 14, 18],
and are known to be reducible to an eective four-point vertex plus total derivatives in the
bulk coordinate. as we found in the previous section these total derivative terms contribute
as contact terms to the correlator. some of these have physical signicance and contain cuts
in the kinematic invariants.

it will suce to consider the s-channel scalar exchange contribution to the correlator of

four axions, hcccci,

(6.1)

following the steps in [13, 14] we partially integrate (6.1) with respect to both the y0 and
z0 coordinates. after partially integrating the y0 coordinate symmetrically we obtain a bulk

plus boundary terms. the second bulk term vanishes through the eld equation for the
massless scalar and the rst reduces to an eective four-point vertex. this contribution will
be cancelled by those from the t- and u-channel exchange diagrams [14]. partially integrating

we must add to these the contributions from the permutations described above. the result

for p mi is symmetric under ~z1  ~z2 and ~z3  ~z4, as is manifest in the original graph.

finally we need to also include the t- and u- channel diagrams to nd full bose symmetry.
the sum of terms does not cancel.

proceeding as before we remove the innities by the introduction of a four-point contri-
bution to the boundary ads theory. the pure divergent contact contributions of m (b)
and
2
m (a)
3 are completely removed similar to the a(3) contribution in the previous section. further
modication of the boundary theory by nite terms may also modify their correlations in the
ads picture. as for the other terms, their fourier transforms contain imaginary parts indi-
cating that they contribute physically. they point to the correlator of products (trf f )2(~z),
(trf f )3(~z), and (trf f )4(~z) with eachother and the original composite operator trf f (~z).
in particular, the fourier transform of the scalar exchange to the hcccci correlator [18]
contains the s-channel cut,

(6.17)

and arises solely from the contact terms above. this is equivalent to the result in [18] after
simplication.

though we have not computed beyond four-point functions it is clear from the previous

results that the pattern of contact terms persists in higher order.

7 interpretation: multi-particle states

composite operator insertions in eld theory lead to additional uv ambiguities in corre-
lation functions; their renormalizations require the addition of counterterms of products of
composite operators to the correlation-functions. recent studies have focused on position
space, where for non-coincident points conformal symmetry imposes tight restrictions on the
correlator expressions. operators at coincident points and counterterms have not been con-
sidered in detail. in this section we discuss these singularities based on the renormalization
of composite operators and how they give a suggestion for the physical interpretation of the
contact terms.

the prescription as arising from string-theory comes with a natural regulator (the in-
nitesimal distance from the boundary of ads). we have found that the holographic super-
gravity description of the cft suers from similar divergences when one takes this distance
to zero. considering n = 4 super yang-mills theory as a consistent theory by itself, one
would like to correct for the divergences by the introduction of counterterms. since one
expects the full string theory embedding to be nite one might ask how string theory will
account for these in the low-energy limit. the free-eld result for the two and three-point
functions are conjectured to be exact to all orders in g2n (stringy) and n (string loop)

12

corrections, yet the answer is still divergent. it could be that these divergences are an addi-
tional feature of string theory in a d-brane (ramond-ramond)-background, that is not yet
understood.

secondly, the supergravity computations yield contact terms which cannot be accounted
for by renormalization of the theory and contain physical information. these delta functions
contribute discontinuously in the operator product expansion and we suggest that they
reect the presence of additional multi-particle string/supergravity states dual to products
of composite operators.

we have corrected for the divergences in the cft correlation functions by the introduc-
tion of a boundary action to the ads bulk theory consisting of a polynomial in the sources
for the conformal operators. complete composite operator renormalization in eld theory
also yields counterterms consisting of compound composite operators which come in a power
series in the source for the simple composite operator [21]. in double insertions of trf f
in greens functions, for instance, one would correct for the uv innities by adding to the
n = 4 sym action a term

s(counter)
cf t

= . . . +

c

8d z dd~xji(~x)jj(~x)oi(~x)oi(~x) + . . .

(7.18)

where oioj are product opertors having dimension eight consistent with the symmetries. in
particular the compound composite : trf f (~x)trf f (~x) : is one of them, though n-counting
arguments show that this term is suppressed as 1/n. this term reects on the supergravity
side how the compound composite operator is dual to a multi-particle state.

one might conjecture that such deformation couplings should be included in the ads/cft
correspondence from the beginning (the renormalization breaks scale invariance). this means
we should consider n = 4 sym plus the space of all deformations

sn =4

cf t = . . . +x j1...jk z dd~x0,j1 . . . 0,jkoj1 . . .ojk ,

(7.19)

with the sources corresponding to boundary values of the ads elds. the j1...jk are di-
mensionful coupling constants. they possibly depend on the renormalization scale after
interpreting the delta functions in preceeding sections as (d)(0) = d. following the pre-
scription in [2, 3] the correlation functions of products of composed operators would then
be given by loop-like calculations in supergravity (point-splitting on the boundary indicates
that these couplings would arise from coincident point limits of single-particle correlation
functions and that the legs connecting to the boundary would be given by the bulk-boundary
kernel). diagrammatically this is understood from pinching boundary points of the external
elds in the original holographic feynman diagram. this alternative loop-like picture de-
scribes how the multi-particle states interact with others, though such loops contribute at
the same order as the regular tree-level diagrams via the normalization of the vertex.

13

composite operator renormalization suggests these multiparticle couplings as in (7.18).
at the same time we have physical contact term contributions to the correlators of simple
operators. they resemble diagrammatically the multiparticle correlators; for instance, the
two separate delta function contributions a(2)
cc in (5.4) and (5.5) would come
from such one- and two-loop supergravity diagrams on ads, respectively. however, in the
ope, from our explicit calculations in earlier sections, we have contact terms which modify
the expansion via

cc and a(3)

on(~x)on(~y) = xj

11

(~z  ~y)2n+j oj + (d)(~x  ~y)o2nd + . . . .

(7.20)

the ads/cft correspondence predicts the ope structure including these delta function
contributions. these new operators are of dimension 2n  d. multi-particle contributions
are expected to contribute at coincident points. the contact contribution in the three-
point function is related in this manner to the correlator htrf f : trf f trf f :i. group-
theoretically these operators belong to multiplets of the superconformal group su(2, 2|4).
the product operator : trf f trf f : is not in an irreducible representation, however, but
for the correlator to be non-zero there must be an overlap with trf f [22]. an investigation
at the free-eld level suggests that this is indeed so.

the iib string ads/cft correspondence in view of these delta functions indicate that
the multi-particle couplings should be present in the string picture. it would be interesting
to derive this coupling from perturbative string theory on ads5  s5. these multi-particle
couplings would be a new feature associated with string theory in a d-brane background.

the ads/cft correspondence requires the existence of multi-particle states which occur
in specic long-multiplets of the ads supergroup [23]. work is in progress in understanding
the string theory prescription for their correlators.

8 discussion

we have provided a scheme for the renormalization of composite operator correlation func-
tions within the ads/cft correspondence in the large n limit involving the addition of a
boundary supergravity theory to the bulk gauged supergravity theory. the general correla-
tion function is made nite by modifying the correspondence as,

k

yj=1  

k

= h

yj=1oj(~zj)iren

cf t ,

(8.1)

where order by order the boundary theory sbt is chosen to contain counterterms renormal-
izing the correlators, as calculated in this work. this scheme does not maintain conformal
invariance. multi-trace states, whose dimensions are not protected, appear at coincident



0,j(~zj)! eissugra[(0)]+isbt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0,j =0

14

points where ultraviolet singularities occur. although the microscopic n = 4 super yang-
mills theory is uv nite [26] there are no non-renormalization theorems for correlators of
composite operators. straightforward calculations of the two-point and three-point func-
tions, for example, show the presence of divergences and the need for a renormalization
scheme. it would be interesting to nd the renormalization in the string context.

the correlators we have examined possess both contact terms in their explicit expres-
sions and singularities which render their fourier transform divergent. the origin of the
divergences, when operators are placed near to each other, has been given a physical inter-
pretation in the ads/cft correspondence. the contact terms in the form of delta function
distributions contribute at these coincident points - they appear discontinously in the ope.
the ope as predicted by string theory contains delta function contributions. we relate
these contributions to multi-particle states which are dual in the ads/cft correspondence
to products of single-trace operators o(~x) at the same point. that their dimensions are
not in general protected are related to the divergences in the theory which occur at short
distances (when points collide).

given these results it appears necessary to examine in greater detail the conformal struc-
ture of the correspondence in the eld theory and possible deformations of the conformal
theory with the operators discussed here.
