the partition function of a two dimensional abelian gauge model reproducing magnetic vortices
is discussed in the harmonic approximation. classical solutions exhibit conformal invariance, that
is broken by statistical uctuations, apart from an exceptional case. the corresponding anomaly
has been evaluated. zero modes of the thermal uctuation operator have been carefully discussed.

i. introduction

in the recent years, a great interest has been devoted to the study of magnetic vortices, which are intimately
connected to the study of superconductivity [1]. a magnetic vortex can be represented as an innitely long magnetic
ux tube in three spatial dimensions or, equivalently, as a two dimensional localised magnetic eld source. the rst
vortex solutions were discussed in 1957 by abrikosov [2] in the framework of the ginzburg-landau model, whereas
nielsen and olesen [3] in 1973 were the rst to recognize that the same type of vortices are also present in a classical
relativistic model, i.e. the abelian higgs model. several years later hong, kim and pac [4] and, independently,
jackiw and weinberg [5], discussed vortex solutions in the same (planar) model, but with dynamics for the gauge
elds governed by a chernsimons (cs) term.
in a cs system, the magnetic eld is proportional to the charge
density, so that any excitation carrying magnetic ux is necessarily charged, contrary to the vortices in the abelian
higgs model, that are electrically neutral.

unfortunately, in both cases the classical solutions are known either asymptotically or by series with complicated re-
cursion formulas [6]. consequently, quantization or thermal uctuations of the system around the classical background
are very dicult to study.

more recently, a dierent type of magnetic vortex was proposed [7] as a solution of 2 dimensional euclidean scalar
electrodynamics with topological coupling.
in such (liouville) vortices, the magnetic eld satises the liouville
equation, all of whose regular solutions can be easily expressed in terms of an arbitrary analytic function. in spite
of the seeming resemblance of this model with the abelian higgs system, liouville vortices are very dierent from
the ones in the ginzburg landau theory. in the ginzburg landau case, the potential of the higgs eld leads to a
spontaneously symmetry breaking. due to this fact the classical vortex solutions, besides the expected long range
tail, have an exponentially decreasing component, and the coecient of the quadratic term in the higgs potential is
related to the characteristic length of the exponential behavior. on the contrary, in liouville vortices the potential
of the scalar eld is that of a pure ||4 theory, without quadratic-mass term. in addition, there is also a non-minimal

1

(topological) interaction that couples the matter density directly to the magnetic eld. as a consequence of these two
facts, liouville vortices exhibit conformal invariance, and their asymptotic behavior is always inverse power-like.

the model leading to liouville vortices shares important properties with two other models: the jackiw and pi model
[8] and the non linear sigma model (nlsm) with o(3) local symmetry [7]. concerning the rst, the prole of the
magnetic eld of these liouville vortices is identical to that discussed by jackiw and pi as the static soliton solution
of the gauged non linear schroedinger equation on the plane, in strong analogy with the abelian higgs model, that
is a classical eld theory whose equations of motion coincides with the non linear schroedinger equation governing
the ginzburg-landau theory for type ii superconductors. concerning the nlsm, in ref. [7] it was shown that all the
solutions of the above mentioned 2 dimensional euclidean scalar electrodynamics can be obtained from the solutions
of nlsm with local symmetry. in addition, there are other important features shared with the euclidean nlsm in 2
dimensions [9] that will be discussed below.

statistical mechanics is a natural framework for topologically non trivial euclidean theories and, on the other hand,
many important physical features that the model in ref. [7] should hopefully exhibit, are strictly related to statistical
mechanics. as an example, if these liouville vortices are really related to superconductivity, a phase transition of the
system should occur at some critical temperature.

in euclidean models, with positive dened actions s and admitting topologically non trivial solutions, the partition
function can be dened as the path integral over the conguration space of the boltzmann factor es [9]. in this
context, the action plays the role of potential energy and the free energy is usually interpreted as interaction energy
due to thermal uctuations. however, in these cases, the denition of temperature in not always straightforward.
for instance, in the nlsm it is common to consider the classical action already implemented by an overall factor
1/e2, i.e.

s =

1

2e2 z d2xn an a ,

n an a = 1 ,

(1)

and such a factor is eventually interpreted as thermal bath  = 1/e2.

as we shall see, in our model it will be possible to rescale the elds in such a way that the action depends on
the u (1) coupling e only through an overall factor 1/e2, just like in the nlsm above, allowing a temperature-like
interpretation of the coupling constant.

the great advantage of such liouville vortices is that the classical solutions are given by relatively simple expressions,
so that the problem of the thermal uctuations of the classical solutions can be faced. to provide a rst insight in
this direction is the aim of the present paper.

in sect. ii we shall briey review the model. the solutions of this model are conformally invariant and can be
classied according to their vorticity, which is proportional to the topological invariant of the model and is nothing
but the degree of the arbitrary analytic function (z) upon which the solutions depend.

in sect. iii we begin the study of the thermal uctuations of the model. after noticing some remarkable similarities
with the euclidean nlsm in 2d, we consider the partition function in the so called harmonic approximation: elds
are parametrized as classical solutions plus small thermal uctuations (small coupling regime), and then the action in
the boltzmann factor is replaced by its expansion around the classical solutions up to the second order in the thermal
uctuations. all the zero modes of the corresponding uctuation operator can be explicitly evaluated, for any choice
of the arbitrary analytic function (z) characterising the background.

if the vorticity n of the background is dierent from the minimal one (i.e. n 6= 1), the conformal symmetry of
the classical solutions is broken by thermal uctuations, and in sect. iv the corresponding conformal anomaly is
explicitly calculated.

in section v we discuss the special case n = 1 and we comment on future developments.

ii. the classical model

let us consider the 2-dimensional euclidean action of a ||4 complex scalar eld minimally coupled to a maxwell

gauge potential with an additional topological coupling

s =z d2xl =z d2x(cid:20) 1

4

f f + (d)d  e f +

e2
2

()2(cid:21)

(2)

where d =   iea is the u (1) covariant derivative and e is the abelian coupling constant that in 2d has
dimensions 1 in mass units. the topological coupling e f is consistent with both u (1) gauge invariance and
iso(2) invariance of the action (2). actually, any general coupling of the type ef ()ij fij and any general scalar

2

potential v (), f and v being arbitrary functionals of the scalar density , would be also allowed, due to the
fact that in 2d the scalar eld  is dimensionless. such a general case has been considered in ref. [7] and, with a
suitable choice of the two functionals, it is possible to obtain classical solutions of the generalised version of the action
(2) satisfying a wide variety of 2 dimensional conformal equations. here we shall restrict to the most interesting case
given by (2).

up to a total derivative, s can be rewritten as

s =z d2xl =z d2x(cid:20)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(dx  i dy) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(b  e )2(cid:21)  0 ,

(3)

b = f12 being the magnetic eld. as a consequence, (3) is extremized by eld congurations satisfying the following
self-duality (anti self-duality) conditions

(d  i  d)  = 0 ,
b = e  .

(4)

it is easy to verify that any conguration satisfying (4) also solves the classical euler-lagrange equations. combining
together eqs. (4), the scalar density  satises the liouville equation
 ln () = 2 e2 () ,

(5)

all of whose regular, positive denite solutions are given by

(6), (z) is an arbitrary meromorphic function and (z) = d/dz. explicit solutions of the self-duality

in eq.
conditions (4) in the covariant gauge a = 0 are [10]

e2 [1 + | (z)| 2]2 .

(6)

e a =   ln(cid:2)1 + |  (z)| 2(cid:3) ,

2 (z)

e  =

1 + |(z)|2 .

(7)

the above eld conguration describes a magnetic vortex. as a matter of fact, for any choice of the arbitrary
meromorphic function (z) the magnetic eld is always localised. the magnetic ux (b) is quantized, as the
integral of the magnetic eld over the whole space is proportional to the degree of the analytic function , i.e. the
number of solutions zi = zi() of the equation  = (z), each multiplied by the appropriate multeplicity bi, namely

(b) =

4n
e

,

n =

1

|(z)|2
(1 + |(z)|2)2 =xi

bi .

(8)

the integer n is usually denoted as vorticity, and is the topological invariant associated to the classical conguration.
for the self-dual congurations we are considering, n > 0. a parity transformation on the solutions maps self-dual
into anti self-dual congurations and the vorticity changes sign.
in 2 dimensions the natural ux units are 0 = 2/q, q being the electric charge. consequently, if we identify e
with the electric charge q, the ux is an even multiple of 0. alternatively, eq. (8) gives a magnetic ux which is
an arbitrary integer n in terms of the natural ux units 0 , provided the abelian coupling e is twice the electric
charge q , suggesting the idea that the matter eld we are considering should be somehow related to an electron-pair
condensate (coopers pair).

in the remaining part of this section, we shall discuss the classical symmetries of the solutions (7), as they will play
a crucial role in the thermal uctuations the model (2). besides the obvious gauge and poincare iso(2) symmetries,
solutions (7) possess also conformal invariance. a conformal transformation

where  is an arbitrary analytic function, connects dierent solutions of the action (2). under the action of the
conformal redenition (9), gauge and matter elds transform as [11]

z = x + iy  (z) = x(x, y) + iy(x, y) ,

(9)

3

(z, z)  (z, z) =
a(r)  a(r) =

(, )

d
dz
 x
x a(r)

(10)

so that the matter density , the magnetic eld and the self-dual derivatives transform as densities with weight
j = det( x/x) = |(z)|2, namely

[(d + id) ] (r) h(cid:16) d + i d(cid:17) i (r) = j [(d + id) ] (r) ,

(11)

,

   (z, z) = j (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(, )
b(z, z)  b(z, z) = jb (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(, )

.

from eqs. (11) it follows that both conditions (4) are preserved under a conformal transformation. conformal
symmetry of the solutions can be easily understood in terms of the energy momentum tensor t. the independent
components of t in 2 dimensions can be chosen to be its trace t and t  = t11  t22  2it12 . in our specic
model (2) such components are given by

t =

1
2

(b + e  ) (b  e  ) , t  = 2 (d1  id2) (d1  id2) ,

(12)

and we see that the self-duality conditions (4), that solve the equations of motion, also make vanishing the whole
energy momentum tensor, and in particular its trace.

nonetheless, the action s is not conformally invariant. at rst sight, conformal symmetry of the solutions could
seem at odd with the fact that the action explicitly depends on a dimensional parameter (the abelian coupling e), and
with the fact that the action is not conformally invariant. however, to preserve the stationary points of the action,
the lagrangian density transforms covariantly under conformal transformations,

s =z d2x l(x) z d2x j l(x) .

(13)

the reason of such a nice transformation property relies in the fact that it is always possible to rescale the elds in
such a way that the action (2) does not contain any mass scale, apart from an overall multiplying factor, just like in
the nlsm (1). as a matter of fact, if we rescale the elds, collectively denoted by , as  = e, the classical action
(2) written in terms of  becomes

s[; e] =

1
e2 s[ ; 1] ,

(14)

and, classically, all the dependence on dimensional parameters in the action (2) can be ruled out.

iii. statistical fluctuations

the partition function of an euclidean system admitting topologically non trivial solutions is dened as the path

integral over the conguration space of the boltzmann factor es [9].

there are some important analogies between the model we have described in the previous section and the nlsm
in eq. (1) that are denitely worth mentioning, also in view of the fact that for the nlsm the partition function can
be estimated in the small coupling regime [9].

in both the models, all the classical solutions are expressed in terms of an arbitrary analytic function (z), and
the topological invariant expressed in terms of (z) is identical for the two models. in addition, due to eq. (14),
also in our model all the dependence on the coupling constant can be factorized in an overall factor 1/e2, allowing
a temperature-like interpretation of the coupling constant in the evaluation of the partition function, just like in the
nlsm.

finally, the most remarkable analogy: following [9], in order to exploit the renormalization group of the system (1),

we decompose the n a variables of the nlsm according to

n a(x) = (1  ||2)1/2n a

0 (x) + iea
i ,

(15)

4

where a = 1, 2, 3 and i = 1, 2. n a
represents the fast uctuations. as a consequence of n a

0 is the so called slowly varying vector and ea

i = 0 and ea

0 ea

j = ij, we have

i are orthogonal to it, whereas i

(16)

the variables a and bi
tuting eqs. (15, 16) in eq. (1) and selecting terms up to the second order in i one gets

 have to be considered as auxiliary variables characterizing the slowly varying elds. substi-

 f(cid:21) ,

s(ii) =

(17)
where  = (1 + i2)/2 and f is the eld strength of the auxiliary variable a. notice that eq. (17) is exactly of
the same type of the quadratic term in  of the action (2); in particular, the same topological coupling is reproduced.
however, its coecient is one half of the one in eq. (2), and therefore eq. (17) is nothing but the f irst term in the
r.h.s. of eq. (3), up to an inessential total derivative. consequently, extremizing the action s(ii) is equivalent to
impose the rst set of self-duality conditions (4). the remaining term of the action in (3) (and the second set of
self-duality conditions (4)) provides the dynamics for the eld a that, instead, in eq. (17) has to be considered as
a background eld.

thus, a rst very rough estimate of the partition function of the model (3) could be obtained in the following way.
in the path integral, one could integrate only over matter uctuations  =  cl induced by the rst term in eq. (3),
keeping the magnetic eld xed and equal to its classical value b =  clcl. then, one immediately gets polyakovs
results and the partition function turns out to be that of a coulomb gas in its plasma phase, with debye screening,
and therefore a mass gap.

on the one hand, thefact that the original system is equivalent to a set of massive fermions is denitely a positive
result, that conrms previous conjectures [7]. on the other hand, a physical interpretation of this picture in terms
of vortices is still obscure and, more important, it is not clear to what extent the approximation of considering only
matter uctuations is reliable.

to proceed, one should consider uctuations of the whole set of self-interacting elds (matter and gauge elds).
clearly, such a problem is much more complicated and an explicit evaluation of the partition function becomes a
formidable problem. however, even without an explicit knowledge of the partition function, something can be done
and interesting results can be obtained.

a. harmonic approximation

in the evaluation of the partition function of our model, the most appropriate approximation is the so called
harmonic approximation, where the action in the boltzmann factor is expanded up to the second order around the
classical solutions. this approximation is frequently used also in quantum mechanics (stationary phase approximation)
where it leads to the one loop eective potential.

clearly, in the harminic approximation, it is assumed that trajectories deviating signicantly from the classical
solutions have a negligible weight in the path integral. in our case, due to eq. (14), this assumption is certainly true
in the small coupling regime. thus, we shall consider the case  = 1/e2  1.
let us decompose the elds  = { a1, a2, 1, 2}, with  = (1/2)( 1 + i 2), as the sum of the classical solutions
cl = (cid:8)acl
 = {a1 , a2 , 1 , 2} and let us consider the formal
expansion of the action (2) around the classical solutions up to the second order in the eld uctuations. the rst
two terms of this expansion vanish, due to the euler-lagrange equations and to the fact that (2) vanishes on the
classical solutions. we have therefore

(20)

where a2 = aa and we omitted, for brevity, the superscript cl on the classical elds in the square brackets. in
order to factorize the 2(x  y) term in the rst equality of (20), some integrations by parts have been performed
and, in so doing, the uctuation operator mij does not look manifestly self-adjoint. this is not a problem, as the
normalizability condition (19) always permits to write mij as in (20).

evidently, in the harmonic approximation the evaluation of the partition function is equivalent to the calculation

of the determinant of mij and, in turn, the solutions of the eigenvalue problem

mij(y) (n)

j (y) = n (n)

i (y)

(21)

would completely solve the problem.

clearly, this approach is practically impossible, due to the complicated form of the operator mij. nonetheless, even
without the explicit knowledge of the determinant, quite often it is possible to calculate expectation values. this is
the case of the conformal anomaly, that we shall evaluate in sect. v with the help of the zeta-function regularization
technique.

b. zero modes of the thermal uctuation operator

from eq. (3), s is manifestly positive denite and, on the classical solutions, (3) achieves its vanishing minima.
consequently, mij has no negative eigenvalues, and the lowest eigenvalues are the zero modes. in our formulation,
there are many operators mij, depending on the choice of the classical background that, in turn, is completely specied
by the choice of the arbitrary meromorphic function (z). for a given choice of  one can associate a topological
invariant n (vorticity) to the classical solutions. the topological invariant classies classical vortex solutions into
distinct inequivalent classes. obviously, in each class there exist innite analytic functions leading to the same
vorticity.

zero modes will strongly depend on the specic choice of the arbitrary analytic function  characterizing the
classical background. nevertheless, the number of normalizable zero modes of the operator mij will depend only on
the homotopy class to which the function  belongs.

zero modes satisfy a rst order equation which is simpler than eq.

(21) with i = 0, and therefore is worth
mentioning. such an equation is a consequence of the peculiar form (3) of the action. due to the self-duality
conditions (4), the action vanishes when evaluated on the classical background (7). on the other hand, from eq. (3)
the action is written as the sum of squares, so that the requirement that the action vanishes up to the second order
in the thermal expansion  = cl +  (zero-modes), is equivalent to the requirement that zero modes  solve the
self-duality conditions (4) expanded up to the f irst order, i.e.

 + idcl

(cid:0)dcl

(cid:1)  = ie (a + ia) cl
b = e(cid:0)cl +  cl(cid:1)

6

(22)

 =   ieacl

where dcl
 , b =  a . it can be veried by direct inspection that eqs. (22) are indeed equivalent
to eq. (21) with i = 0. moreover, eqs. (22) can be decoupled and rewritten as a schroedinger type problem. taking
eqs. (4) and (5) into account, it is not dicult to check that the magnetic eld b of the zero modes has to satisfy the
equation

(cid:18) b

bcl(cid:19) = 2eb

(23)

that, written in terms of b/bcl = , becomes the zero-energy schroedinger equation for a unit mass wavefunction 
moving in the classical potential v = ebcl, i.e.

1
2



 + v  = 0 ,

v = ebcl .

(24)

consequently, by nding the zero modes of our system one gets, as a by-product, the zero energy solutions of the
above schroedinger equation.

zero modes of the uctuation operator mij are associated to the continuous symmetries of the classical solutions.
such symmetries are: translations, rotations, gauge transformations, conformal transformations and variations of the
arbitrary parameters upon which the classical solutions may depend. practically, once a gauge choice has been picked,
all such symmetries are included in conformal transformations.

it can be shown that, starting from a classical solution cl, the zero mode of the operator mij associated to
the continuous symmetry  with innitesimal parameter  is given by the variation of cl under the action of the
continuous symmetry  , i.e. if cl  cl + cl, then  = cl/ is the zero mode of mij associated to the
symmetry . the proof can be easily obtained by performing a transformation  on the euler - lagrange equations.
the same procedure can be also generalised to local symmetries, like the gauge and the conformal ones. in this
case, zero modes are obtained by performing an innitesimal transformation on the classical elds: the obtained result
is a zero mode also when the function specifying the continuous transformation is no longer innitesimal. several
examples will be provided below.

c. explicit evaluation of zero modes

we begin by evaluating the zero mode associated to the gauge symmetry. by performing an (innitesimal) gauge

transformation on the classical solutions we get

g =(cid:18) 1

e

  ;   cl

2 ;  cl

1 (cid:19)

(25)

it can be veried that (25) is a solution of the coupled equations (22), and therefore a zero mode of mij for any
arbitrary function  (x) , not necessarily innitesimal. however, the simultaneous requirement of normalizability (19)
and the gauge condition a = 0 forces  to be a constant. introducing for later convenience complex notation
a = a1 + i a2 for the uctuations of the gauge potential, the only normalizable zero mode associated to residual gauge
symmetry is then

g = (, a)  (icl , 0) .

(26)

we now consider the remaining symmetry transformations of the classical solutions. such symmetries are all
included in the conformal one, since traslations, rotations and variations of the parameters upon which the classical
solutions may depend can be always seen as particular cases of conformal transformations. actually, even the zero
mode (26) arises from a particular conformal transformation.

since the classical solutions are completely determined in terms of the arbitrary analytic function (z) (see eq.
(7)), we can write a general expression for the zero mode associated to a given symmetry  in terms of  and ,
 being the variation of  under the action of . by direct calculation we obtain the following general form of the
zero modes  = (, a):

e  =

e a = 2i (cid:18)  +

1 + ||2 (cid:19) .

now it is immediate to check that the zero mode (26) is a particular case of (27), with  = i  . in turn, such a 
can be always obtained through a conformal transformation, so that hereafter the zero mode (27) will be classied
among the conformal ones.

the modes (27) are already in the lorentz gauge ( a +  a = 0 in complex notation). among them, we have to
select only the normalizable ones by imposing eq. (19). in turn, normalizability condition (19) can also be written
in terms of  and . after straightforward calculations, one can see that such a requirement is equivalent to the
convergence condition of the two following integrals

equations (27) and (28) dene the zero modes of the uctuation operator associated to the continuous symmetry
. it should be noticed that (27) are indeed eigenvectors of the operator mij with vanishing eigenvalue even without
specifying neither the form of , nor its variation . on the contrary, the normalizability criterion (28) will depend
on the particular choice of arbitrary function  as well as on the variation  associated to the zero mode. as a
consequence, to continue, we have to provide some specic examples.

let us x the topological number of the classical solution to be n . clearly, there are innite functions  with such
a degree. here, we shall consider two limiting examples, in such a way that the evaluation of zero modes in all the
other possible choices of  will be easily understood as intermediate between these two cases.

the rst example is the totally degenerate case, where all the vorticity n is carried by a single vortex that, for

convenience, will be located at the origin. then,

where z0 is a scale introduced to render  dimensionless, as required. the choice (29) corresponds to the radially

where r = |z| and r0 = |z0|. in this totally degenerate case, all the zero modes are easily obtained by performing a
conformal transformations of the type z  z + (z) on the classical solutions. the corresponding variation on  is
thus

 = (z)(z) = n

n 1

z0 (cid:18) z
z0(cid:19)

(z) .

(31)

we have now to investigate on the form of the function (z). since the classical solutions (30) vanish only at the origin
and at innity, one can easily realize that the only possible singularities of the function (z) can be at the origin and
at innity: a singularity of  in any other point  6= 0 would necessarily render the corresponding zero mode singular
and not normalizable in z =  . on the contrary, singularities of  at the origin are admissible, provided that when
inserted in (27) and (28) they cancel against the corresponding zeros of the classical solutions and of the integration
measure. thus, in this totally degenerate case, it is not restrictive to consider functions  as pure powers of the type
n = gn(z/r0)n, with gn complex coecients, and count the number of independent functions n that render the zero
modes normalizable. for a given n(z) and with (z) of the form (29), the zero modes (27) take the form

(32)

considering the asymptotic behaviour of the zero modes (32) at the origin and at innity, one can easily see that eq.
(32) dene normalizable zero modes as long as 1  n  n  1. thus, there are n + 1 admissible values of n. since
the coecients gn are complex, two linearly independent zero modes [12] correspond to each value of n , and eq. (32)
with 1  n  n  1 denes the 2n + 2 zero modes of the totally degenerate case.
notice that zero modes associated to iso(2) symmetry and to a variation of the parameter z0 in (29) are included
in eq. (32) with n = 0 (traslations) and n = 1 (rotations if g1 is purely imaginary, and variation of the parameter z0
if g1 is purely real). in addition, from eq. (31), the gauge zero mode (26) is also a particular case of eq. (32) with
n = 1.

as a second limiting example we shall consider the totally non degenerate case, i.e. the choice of  that, for a given

value n of vorticity, depends on as many free parameters as possible. such an (z) is [13], for instance,

(z) = 0

n

yi=1

(z  ai)
(z  bi)

,

(33)

with ai 6= aj, bi 6= bj
if i 6= j and ai 6= bj for any i, j. it depends on 4n + 2 real parameters (the constants 0,
{ai} and {bi} are complex) and it corresponds to a classical n -vortex conguration, where each vortex carries the
minimum vorticity. the explicit location of the vortices is irrelevant to our purposes, but in general it will be a
function of all the parameters [14].

let us dene

in such a way that (z) and its variation under a conformal transformation z  z + (z) can be rewritten as

(34)

(35)

we have to investigate on the possible form of the arbitrary function (z) associated to the conformal variation
 that makes the integrals (28) convergent. we rst notice that, if (z) is regular in z = ai, then also () is
regular in ai. thus, integrability of i1 and i2 in z = ai only requires (z) to be regular at z = ai. in z  bi, ()
behaves like (bi)/(z  bi)3.on the other hand, the quantity (1 + ||2)2 goes to zero for z  bi like |z  bi|4. thus,
in order to render convergent i1, (z) must have at least simple zeros in z = bi, and therefore it has to be of the type
(z) = b f (z), with f regular in bi and ai. finally, integrability of i1 at innity requires f (z)  1/zq with q  n  1.
there is only one possibility to have such a behaviour without introducing extra singularities in , that is when the
poles of f (z) exactly cancel with the zeros of (z). consequently, f (z) and (z) have to be of the form

fn (z) =

pn (z)

abpn

i=1(cid:16) 1

zbi(cid:17)
zai  1

, n (z) = bfn (z) ,

(36)

where pn (z) is an arbitrary polynomial of degree n . it is not dicult to verify that for such a choice of (z) also
i2 is convergent. thus, n  = (z) n (z), with n (z) dened as in (36), is the most general form of conformal
variations dening normalizable zero modes. since an arbitrary polynomial of degree n depends on n + 1 arbitrary
complex parameters, the number of normalizable zero modes associated to conformal symmetry in the totally non
degenerate case is 2n + 2, just like in the totally degenerate case.

9

we conclude this section by observing that all the zero modes in the totally non degenerate case could have also
been obtained through innitesimal variations of the parameters dening (z). under a variation of the parameters
bi, the corresponding variation of  is bi  /bi = (z)/(z  bi). however, such a variation renders divergent i1
due to a non integrable singularity in z = bi, and innitesimal variations of bi do not dene normalizable zero modes.
under a variation of the remaining parameters 0 and ai we have

0   (z)/0 = (z)/0 ,
ai  /ai = (z)/(z  ai) .

(37)

substituting (37) in (28), we have that both i1 and i2 are convergent, and eqs. (37) dene 2n + 2 normalizable zero
modes. obviously, these modes are not independent as they are precisely of the form (35), (36). actually, any linear
combination of the zero modes associated to (37) can be used as a basis for the arbitrary functions n (z) in (36).

finally, also in this case one can easily check that the zero modes associated to iso(2) symmetry as well as the

gauge zero mode (26) are contained in eqs. (35), (36) (or, equivalently, in eqs. (37)).

starting from these two limiting examples, it is easy to extract zero modes from any other intermediate choice of
the arbitrary function (z) . in all the cases, the number of the normalizable zero modes is 2n + 2 and it is thus only
a function of the topological sector associated to the classical background.

the thermal correction to the magnetic eld due to the zero modes is given by

for instance, in the radially symmetric case, eq. (38) reads

b = a =

1 + ||2 (cid:19) .

with 1n  n  1. it can be shown that the integral over the whole plane of eq. (39) vanishes for any 1n  n  1,
so that zero modes corrections to the magnetic eld do not modify the vorticity of the classical solutions, as expected
on general ground.

having the zero modes corrections to the magnetic eld, eq. (38) or (39), the solutions of the zero energy sector of

the schroedinger equation (24) straightforwardly follow.

iv. conformal anomaly

although the overall factor 1/e2 in eq. (14) is clearly irrelevant at the classical level, one expects that statistically
such a term is no longer inessential, as it introduces an explicit scale in the path integral. in this case the coupling
constant will acquire a non trivial dependence on the arbitrary mass scale  that any regularization precedure entails
[15], and an anomaly is expected: the expectation value of the trace of the energy momentum is likely to be non-zero.
here we shall evaluate this expectation value by using the -function regularization technique.

the determinant of the thermal uctuation operator m , dened as the product of its non vanishing eigenvalues [16]
n n[m ], is divergent due to the unbounded nature of its eigenvalues n. a popular way to circumvent
this problem, is to dene the regularised determinant through the zeta function. the zeta function appropriate to
our problem is dened by

det m = q

 (s|m ) xn

 s

n [m ] = tr (cid:0)m s(cid:1) .

the  function is regular for re s > d/m, where m is the order of the dierential operator m and d the dimension of
the manifold. however,  can be analytically continued to the point s = 0 and the regularised determinant is dened
as

[ ln det  m ]   lim

s0(cid:20)

d
d s

 (s|m )(cid:21)    (0|m ) .

(40)

let us introduce the kernel

 ( t; x, y | m ) 

1

 (s) z 

0

dt t s1 h h ( t; x, y | m )  p (0) (x , y)i

,

(41)

where p (0) is the projector into the zero mode space and h ( t; x, y | m ) the heat kernel satisfying the dierential
equation (/t + mx)h ( t; x, y | m ) = 0 with boundary condition h ( 0; x, y | m ) = i(d)(x  y). the heat kernel at
x = y can be expanded in powers of t through the so called seeley - de witt [17] coecients

h ( t; x, x| m ) =

1

(4  t)d/m [ a0 ( x| m ) + a1 ( x| m ) t + . . . ] .

(42)

finally, standard manipulations [18] permits to express the value of (s = 0 | m ) in terms of the seeley - de witt
coecient ad/m and the number n of zero modes of the operator m as

(s = 0 | m ) =

1

(4)d/m trz ddxad/m(x)  n .

(43)

in our case, d/m = 1 and the total number of zero modes is n = 2n + 2, as seen in the previous section.
by

it can be shown [19] that the integral of the expectation value of the trace of the energy momentum tensor is given

where  is the usual mass parameter introduced to render the operator (m/2) dimensionless, as required. conse-
quently, the integrated trace anomaly is just given by (0), up to a sign,

z d2z hti =   (0) .

(45)

in turn, from eq. (43), (0) can be expressed in terms of the total number of zero modes of the operator m and in
term of the integrated a1 seeley - de witt coecient. thus, we only need to evaluate such a coecient.

if a (matrix valued) dierential operator m is written in the form

m = d+

 d + x , x = x +

(46)

with d = 1  ic, d+
 , c and x being matrices whose entries are solely classical
elds (not operators), then the coecient a1 is just x. in our case the operator m was already introduced in eq.
(20), and after algebraic manipulations and taking the gauge a = 0 and the self-duality conditions into account,
it follows that m can be indeed written in the form (46), with

v. discussion

(50)

(51)

among the local gauge theories admitting classical vortex solutions, the one we have presented is particularly
interesting. first of all its classical solutions are very simple. all the solutions can be expressed in terms of an
arbitrary analytic function, which is the arbitrary analytic function specifying the regular solutions of the liouville
equation. to any classical eld conguration, there is an associated topological invariant (vorticity), which is the
degree of the analytic function. the topological invariant is the same of that characterizing the solutions of the 2d
euclidean nlsm, all of whose solutions can be also expressed in terms of an arbitrary analytic function.

the trace of the energy momentum tensor vanishes on the classical solutions and, consequently, conformal trans-
formations are a symmetry of the classical solutions: a conformal reparametrization relates two dierent solutions of
the model. related to this fact there is also the factorization property (14) of the coupling constant e, that is the only
dimensional parameter of the model. such a factorization is important also because it permits, for topological models,
a temperature-like interpretation of the coupling constant ( = 1/e2). in this context, the euclidean action should
be interpreted as the potential energy of the system whereas the free energy should represent the energy uctuations
due to the interaction with the thermal bath . in the limit of small coupling (large ), the partition function of the
system is just the determinant of operator obtained byexpanding the classical action around the classical solutions up
to the second order in the thermal uctuations. the evaluation of the determinant requires a regularization procedure
and, therefore, an arbitrary scale. consequently, one expects that thermal uctuations destroys scale (and conformal)
symmetry, and in fact there is a conformal anomaly: the expectation value of the trace of the energy momentum
tensor does not vanish, except for the special value n = 1 (see eq. (51)). when the classical background carries the
minimum vorticity (n = 1), conformal symmetry seems to survive, at least in the harmonic approximation.
this is a very surprising property that certainly deserves a deeper analysis. at present, we do not know the exact
reason of such a phenomenon. nonetheless, there are indeed some properties that make the case n = 1 dierent
from the others. for example, the trace of the a1 seeley  de witt coecient or, alternatively, the shape of the
potential v = ebcl felt by the schroedinger particle (24), dramatically changes in the cases n = 1 and n 6= 1. let
us consider for convenience the radially symmetric case. then, if n = 1, the potential v = ebcl = e2clcl is
a monotonic radial function, and therefore it has a single, non degenerate minimum at r = 0. on the contrary, if
n 6= 1, the potential v has a maximum point at r = 0, whereas its minima are degenerate and located around the
circle r = r0[(n  1)/(n + 1)]1/2n . thus, there is the intriguing possibility that the occurence of conformal anomaly
could be related to the vacuum degeneracy of the free energy.
another feature that makes the case n = 1 dierent from all the others is the following: the most general solution
carrying vorticity 1 is obtained by choosing the arbitrary analytic function (z) = 0(z  a)/(z  b). it is easily
recognized that such a function is in a one to one correspondence with an arbitrary transformation of the group
sl(2, c), z   = (az + b)/(cz + d), ad  bc = 1. this is a very special subgroup of the conformal group: it denes
the projective transformations, that are the only conformal transformations providing invertible mappings of the whole
complex plane onto itself. as a consequence of this fact, sl(2, c) is a kind of residual symmetry one has, once
the the number of vortices and the total vorticity has been xed: let the pair (q,n ) denote an arbitrary background
eld conguration of q vortices with total vorticity n ; then, applying an arbitrary sl(2, c) transformation, the
background (q,n ) is mapped into another background but with the same pair (q,n ). by contrast, if a conformal
transformation z  (z) not belonging to sl(2, c) is applied to a eld conguration (q,n ), it necessarily increases
vorticity, i.e. (q,n )  (q  q,n  > n ). clearly, if n = 1 (minimum vorticity) then necessarily q = 1, and only
in this case it happens that the most general element (z) characterizing the background (q = 1,n = 1) belongs
to the same group of transformations leaving the background (q = 1,n = 1) unchanged. this observation is at the
root to understand why the n = 1 case is not anomalous.

12

besides the conformal anomaly, we have also evaluated the zero modes of the thermal uctuation operator. for a
given xed vorticity n , we have derived the zero modes in two limiting cases of the classical background: the totally
degenerate and the totally non degenerate cases, corresponding to a single vortex located at the origin and carrying
vorticity n , and to n distinct vortices carrying each the minimum vorticity, respectively. all the other possible cases
can be easily derived as intermediate between these two. clearly, the explicit form of the zero modes dependson the
classical background. however, the total number of normalizable zero modes is only a function of the vorticity of the
classical solutions. in addition, the contribution to the thermal uctuations given by the zero modes does not change
the vorticity of the classical solution.

there are several aspects related to this model that deserve consideration for future investigations. an important
problem is certainly a deeper understanding of the persistence of conformal symmetry in the n = 1 case, and its
possible relation with the non-degenerateness of the free energy vacuum.
concerning the eigenvalue problem (21) or, equivalently, the determinant of the operator m , an exact evaluation
seems very dicult. however, some approximate method should be available to investigate the system beyond the
zero-mode sector, perhaps reducing the number of degrees of freedom by introducing some collective coordinates.
alternatively, one could try to investigate some particular limits that simplify the form of the matrix m . to this
purpose, two particular cases should be mentioned: if r0  0, liouville vortices becomes aharonov-bohm vortices,
i.e. acl   and bcl  (r). this limit greatly simplify the form of the uctuation operator, although in this case
the classical solutions become singular. another interesting limit is the large n limit; in this case the magnetic eld
has a signicant non vanishing contribution only in a neighbourhood of r = r0, and it could be easier to evaluate the
determinant.

another interesting issue is the possibility that the model (2) could be an eective action of another, more
elementary, model. this hypothesis could be supported by the fact that liouville vortices always have an even
vorticity in terms of the elementary ux quanta 0 = 2/e when the abelian coupling e is interpreted as electric
constant. consequently, it could be that the scalar eld  is related to an electron pair condensate. a further point
towards this direction is the one discussed at beginning of section 3: in the very drastic approximation considered
there, the partition function is the one of a coulomb gas in its debye phase that, in turn, can be equally described
by a system of massive fermions.

finally, at the purely classical level, it could be interesting to investigate on the possibility of constructing non linear
superpositions of liouville vortices: just like the t hooft polyakov monopole can be seen as a non linear superposition
of innite instantons equally separated in time [20], a non linear superposition of liouville vortices could provide new
soliton solutions of some lower dimensional gauge theory.

[10] from now on, without loosing generality, we shall restrict ourselves to self-dual congurations, i.e. upper sign in eqs. (4).
this is clearly not restrictive as anti-self-dual solutions can be always obtained through a parity transformation on self-dual
solutions.

[11] to understand the transformation properties of the elds under (9), one can consider the solutions (7) with   z, and
then interpret the general form (7) as the conformally transformed elds under the redenition z  (z). then, eqs. (10)
follow.

[12] in spite of the fact that zero modes are dened up to an overall constant, gn and ign dene two distinct zero modes due

to the fact that in eq. (27) zero modes depend linearly on  and its complex conjugate.

[13] the choice of  is not unique. for instance, an alternative choice is a nite mittag-leer sum of the type (z) =
n=1 ai/(z  bi), depending on 2n + 1 complex parameters. we choose the nite product expansion because in this

0 +pn

13

case is much easier to check the normalizability conditions of the zero modes. it is important to remark that, whatever is
the choice of  when the vorticity is xed, the maximum number of real parameters upon which  depends is xed and
equal to 4n + 2.

[14] the position of the vortices can be easily found by studying the extrema of the magnetic eld eb = 4|(z)|2/(1+|(z)|2)2;

for example, in the n = 1 case the position of the single vortex is at z1 = (a1|0|2 + b1)/(1 + |0|2).

[15] in this case, a regularization in the evaluation of the partition function is required due to the innite number of degrees of

freedom of the system.

[16] following the standard notation, the prime index means that the vanishing eigenvalues have to be omitted from sums

and/or products.
