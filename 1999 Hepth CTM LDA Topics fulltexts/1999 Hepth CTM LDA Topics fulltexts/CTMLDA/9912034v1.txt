abstract

based on the renormalisability of the su(n) theory with massive gauge bosons, we start with the

path integral of the generating functional for the renormalized green functions and develop a method

to construct the scattering matrix so that the unitarity is evident. by using as basical variables

the renormalized eld functions we form an operator description with which the renormalized green

functions can be expressed as the vacuum expectations of the time ordered products of the heisen-

berg operators of the renormalized eld functions, that satisfy the usual equal time commutation

or anticommutation rules. with the total hamiltonian eh that determine the time evolution of the

heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions, and the unperturbed hamiltonian h0 that,

under the lorentz condition, describes the free elds, we dene an interaction picture and verify that

the operators u (, ), which describes the time evolution from  to  in the interaction

pidture conserve invariant the qusi-gupta-bleuler state subspace spanned by all the eigen states of

h0 that satisfy the lorentz condition. therefore the scattering matrix is nothing but the matrix of

u (, ) within this subspace, with respect to a base formed by the eigen states of h0. moreover,

we nd a formular to express the scattering matrix elements in terms of the truncated renormalized

green functions.

i. introduction

since the su(n) theory with a mass term of the gauge elds was considered to be in general nonrenor-

malisable (see for example [16]), the inuence of such a mass term on the unitarity of the scattering

matrix has not yet been deeply studied. now that the renormalisability of the theory has been proven[7]

further analysis is available. in the present paper, instead of checking the negative arguments concerning

the unitarity we will develop a method to construct the scattering matrix with the renormalized eld

functions as basical variables so that the unitarity is evident.

owing to the renormalisability of theory, one can start with the path integral of the generating

functional for the renormalized green functions and form an operator description with the renormalized

eld functions as basical variables. this means that the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld

functions satisfy the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules and the renormalized green

functions can be expressed as the vacuum expectations of the time odered products of such heisenberg

eld operators. on the other hand starting from the path integral of the generating functional for the

unrenormalized green functions, one can form another operator description with the bare eld functions

as basical variables. it should be emphasized that such two operator descriptions are of dierent types. in

particular, the eld operators belonging to the two operator descriptions operate on dierent state spaces

and can not be transformed into each other by unitary transformations or by scale transformations.

according to the very idea of renormalisation we decide to choose the rst kind of operator de-

scription. with the renormalized eld functions and the renormalized parameters we will dene a non-

interacting lagrangian l0 which, under the lorentz condition, determine the green functions of the free

elds. next we will nd a hamiltonian h0 corresponding to l0 and dene a qusi-gupta-bleuler supspace

which is spanned by all the eigen states of h0 that satisfy the lorentz condition. by giving a operator

expression for the generating functional for the green functions of the free elds, we will able to do the

same for the generating functional for the renormalized full green functions and nd the total hamilto-

nian eh that determine the time evolution of the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions.
with eh and h0 we will dene an interaction pidture and verify that the operators u (, ), which

describes the time evolution from  to  in the interaction pidture conserve invariant the qusi-

gupta-bleuler state subspace. in this way, the denition and the unitarity of the scattering matrix will

be made evident.

the operator description will be given in section 2. in section 3 we will explain the denition and

the unitarity of the scattering matrix and briey describe the asymptotic eld viewpoint based on our

2

operator description. in section 4 a formular will found to express the scattering matrix elements in terms

of the truncated renormalized green functions. concluding remarks will be given in the nal section.

ii. operator description with renormalized eld functions as basical variables

assume that the theory has been renormalized under a proper renormalization scheme so that the

renormalized parameters such as the masses represent the physical ones. the generating functional for

the renormalized green functions can be expressed as

z [r][j, , , , ] =

1

n z d[a, c, c, , ] ya,x

 (aa(x)) expni(cid:0)i e + is(cid:1)o ,

(2.1)

where n is a contant to make z [r][0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, is is the source term

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)ca(x) + c a(x)a(x)

is =z d4x(cid:2)j 

+a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3) .

the action i e is formed by the folloing lagrangian with the counterterm

le =

+(cid:0)  c a(x)(cid:1)d

abcb(x) + lcount ,

(2.2)

in which a term (1/2)(cid:0)aa(cid:1)2

is added with the help of the lorentz condition included in the integrand

of (2.1) to modify the quadratic part of  1

into a guptableuler lagrangian

where

lgb(x) =

f [0]

2(cid:0)aa(cid:1)2

,

f [0]

a = aa   aa .

we also emphasize the fact that the lorentz condition leads to

 z r
j 
a (x)

= 0 .

(2.3)

according to the idea of renoremalization the free evolution of the physical particles should be

described by combining the lorentz condition with the lagrangian

l0(x) = lgb(x) +

m 2aa(x)a

a (x) + l(x) +(cid:0)  c a(x)(cid:1)d

(2.4)

to treat this problem by an operator method, one can perform a canonical quantization and dene the

hamiltonian opereator h0 and eld opereators by paying no attention to the lorentz condition and then

use this condition to choose the so-called physical states and dene a physical state subspase. that is,

this subspase is spanned by all the eigen states of h0 which satisfy the lorentz condition. the method is

similar to that used in the guptableuler quantization although there are dierences caused by the mass

term of the gauge elds. we will simply call such a subspace as qusi-gupta-bleuler or qgb subspace. if

we can nd a total hamiltonian which determines the time evolution of the heisenberg operators of the

renormalized eld functions, it will be possible to construct a couple of mappings to map each physical

eigen state of h0 into an outgoing eigen state and an incoming eigen state of the total hamiltonian.

the latter eigen states can then be used to dene the scattering matrix. in fact, these mappings can be

expressed in terms of the time evolution operators u (0, ) in the interaction picture dened by the

total hamiltonian and h0, where u (0, ) describes the time evolution from  to 0 and u (0, )

describes the evolution from + to 0. consequently it would be easy to dene the scattering matrix if

operators u (, ), which describe the time evolution from  to  conserve invariant the qgb

subspace. it will be seen that these tentative ideas are correct. however, we will have to introduce the

gauge xing term and construct an appropriate operator description with  being nite.

with the help of the the gauge xing term lgf =  1

2(cid:0)aa(cid:1)2

one can express (2.1) as

z [r][j, , , , ] = lim
0

z [r]



[j, , , , ] ,

where

z [r]



[j, , , , ] =

1

n z d[a, c, c, , ]expni(cid:0)ie + is(cid:1)o ,

where n is a constant to make z [r]



[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, and

ie = i e +z d4xlgf (x) .

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

needles to say, quantities dened by using z [r]



[j, , , , ] depend on , but this parameter will often

be omitted.

denote by z 0[j, , , , ] the generating functional for green functions determined by the lagrangian

l0. on performing the cononical quantization based on this lagrangian, one has

ez 0[j, , , , ] = h0|texpniz d4x(cid:2)j 

a (x)aa(x)

+ a(x)ca(x) + c a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3)o|0i ,

(2.8)

4

where aa(x), ca(x), a(x),    are eld operatos satisfying the usual equal time commutation or anti-

commutation rules and their time evolution are determined by h0. the state |0i is the eigen state of h0

belonging to the lowest eigegvalue (assigned to be zero). dene ehi so that

ie = z d4xehi (x) +z d4xl0(x) ,

thus one has from (2.6)

and











then taking the normal products with respect to |0i. each of the two prorortion coecients in (4.10)
should make z [r]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1. it is evident that the time evolution of ehi is determined by h0:



ehi (t) = eih0t ehi (0)eih0t .
t expn  i z d4x ehi (x)o

is the time evolution opewrator u (, ) in the interction picture dened by h0 and the interaction

therefore, the operayor

r d3xehi (0), namely

and

t expn  iz d4x ehi (x)o = u (, ) ,
u (t, t0) = eih0teieh(tt0)eih0t0 ,
eh = h0 +z d3xehi (0) .
[j, , , , ]  h 0 |u (, 0)(cid:16)t expniz d4xhj

it follows that (2.10) can be written as

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

the prorortion coecient should make z [r]



[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1. the time evolution of the operators

h

a(t) = eiehtaa(0)eieht ,
a (t) = eiehtca(0)eieht ,
a(t) = eiehtc a(0)eieht ,
a (t) = eiehta(0)eieht ,
a(t) = eiehta(0)eieht .

c

therefore eh is the total hamiltonian operator and ah

heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions. thus (2.15) meams that the renormalized green

h

functions can be expressed as the vacuum expectations of the time ordered products of the heisenberg

operators of the renormalized eld functions. it should be emphasized that these eld operators satisfy

the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules.

iii. the scattering matrix

from (2.15) and (2.3), we nd

h0|u (, 0)t(cid:16)ah

lim
0

a(x)expniz d4y(cid:2)j 

b (y)ah

b (y) +   (cid:3)o(cid:17)u (0, )|0i = 0 .

we now take the derivatives of this with respect to various sources at various instants other than t and

then let the sources tend to 0. next, let the times larger than t tend to  and those smaller than t tend

to . in this way we get

hh|ah

a(x)|hi = 0 ,

lim
0

(3.1)

where the heisenberg state vector |hi can be an arbitrary linear combination of the states obtained by

arbitrarily operating on u (0, )|0i with the eld operators of huge t, and the heisenberg state vector

|hi can be an arbitrary linear combination of the states obtained by arbitrarily operating on u (0, )|0i

with the eld operators of huge t. since these states relate to the remote time, they can be found from

states of t =  in the interaction picture. namely

|hi = u (0, )|i()i ,

|hi = u (0, )|i()i ,

6

(3.2)

(3.3)

where the index i in the states |i i, |ii stands for the interaction picture. of course |i()i,

|i ()i should satisfy a certain condition to make (3.1) valid. substituting these in (3.1) we have

hi ()|u (, t)aa(x)u (t, )|i ()i = 0 ,

hi ()|u (, t)aa(x)u (t, )|i ()i = 0 ,

lim
0

lim
0

when t is large enough, (3.4) leads to

hi ()|aa(x)|i ()i = 0 ,

lim
0

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

in fact this equation is valid for any t, because the time volution of aa(x) is determnied by h0. that

is, |i ()i, |i ()i are restricted by (3.1) in the qgb subspace. thus (3.2) means

h

gb|u (, t)aa(x)u (t, )|gbi = 0 ,

lim
0

where |gbi and |

gbi are arbitrary states in the qgb subspace. when t is large enogh we get

h

gb|u (, )aa(x)u (, )|gbi = 0 .

lim
0

(3.7)

this equation is also valid for any t. a similar reasoning from (3.5) indicates that the states of t =  in

the interaction picture are also restricted by (3.1) in the qgb subspace and that

h

gb|u (, )aa(x)u (, )|gbi = 0 .

lim
0

(3.8)

it follows from (3.7) and (3.8) that the operators u (, ) conserve invariant the qgb subspace.

therefore we express the elements of the scattering matrix as

sf i = lim
0

hf |u (, )|ii
h0|u (, )|0i

.

(3.9)

where |ii and |f i are within the qgb subspace and are the eigen states of h0.

the states u (0, )|gbi are normalized just like |gbi and one thus has

u (, 0)u (0, )|gbi = |gbi ,

and

u (0, )u (, 0)u (0, )|gbi = u (0, )|gbi .

next, as indicated in (3.2) and (3.3), u (0, )|gbi (u (0, +)|gbi) can also be expressed in terms

of out (in) states, therefore

u (0, )u (, 0)u (0, )|gbi = u (0, )|gbi .

7

it follows that

u (, )u (, )|gbi = u (, 0)nu (0, )u (, 0)ou (0, )|gbi

= u (, 0)u (0, )|gbi = |gbi .

this ensures the unitarity of the scattering matrix.

with the help of the time evolution operator in the interaction picture we can also dene the operators

of so-called asymptotic elds which will be denoted by aa,in(x), aa,out(x), a,in(x) and a,out(x),   .

these are free elds, and when t is very large each in-operator proportional to the heisenberg operator

of the renormalized eld function. actually each proportion coecent should be equal to 1 in order not

to destroy the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules. on the other hand when t is

very large each out-operator is equal to the heisenberg operator of the renormalized eld function. using

ah

a(x) = u (0, t)aa(x)u (t, 0) ,

h

a (x) = u (0, t)a(x)u (t, 0) ,

c h

a (x) = u (0, t)ca(x)u (t, 0) .

and noticing that when |t| is large enough, u (0, t)andu (t, 0) are independent of t, one gets

aa,in(x) = u (0, )aa(x)u (, 0) ,

a,in(x) = u (0, )a(x)u (, 0) ,

aa,out(x) = u (0, )aa(x)u (, 0) ,

a,out(x) = u (0, )a(x)u (, 0) ,

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

since the asymptotic elds are free ones, these are valid for any t. the formulae for the other elds are

similar.

if the instates and outstates are dened by

|0, in i =

|0, out i =

|i, in i =

|i, out i =

u (0, )|0i

u (0, )|0i

ph 0|u (, )|0 i
ph 0|u (, )|0 i
ph 0|u (, )|0 i
ph 0|u (, )|0 i

u (0, )|ii

u (0, )|ii

,

,

,

,

8

then (3.9) can be written as

sf i = lim
0

hf, out|i, ini = lim
0

h f, in|u (0, )u (, 0)|i, in i .

(3.14)

iv. a expression for the scattering matrix elements in terms

of the truncated renormalized green functions

in the following we will derive a formula to express the elements of the scattering matrix in terms of

the truncated renormalized green functions. dene the operator

u (j, , , , ) = t(cid:16)u (, )expniz d4x(cid:2)j 

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)ca(x)

+c a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3)o(cid:17) .

(4.1)

we thus have

and

u (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) = u (, ) ,

h0|u(j,,,,)|0i

h0|u(,)|0i = z [r]



[j, , , , ] .

analogous to (2.10), we also have

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)ca(x)

+c a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3)o .

denoting by hi (x) the part of ehi (x) obtained by excluding the gauge xing term, we can write (4.3) as
(i)(x)(cid:19)(cid:27) u (0)(j, , , , ) , (4.4)

noticed that h0|u (0)(j, , , , )|0i is the generating functional for the green functions determined

by the lagrangian l0 + lgf and can be explicitly expressed as

(4.7)

as for the operator u (0)(j, , , , ), one has

we can nd, in the limit as   0, that

(4.9)

where x [r][j, , , , ] stands for the generating functional for truncated renormalized green functions[8].

this is the formula we need. in the above manipulation, we have taken into account the fact that the

momenta of the particles in the initial or nal staes are on the mass shell and for such momenta the

renormalized full propagators become free propagators.

iv. concluding remarks

with the help of the path integral of the generating functional for the renormalized green functions

and with the renormalized eld functions as basical variables we have formed a satisfying operator de-

scription and found the total hamiltonian which determine the time evolution of the heisenberg operators

of the renormalized eld functions. furthermore, we have veried that the operators u (, ) which

describe the time evolution from  to  in the interaction pidture dened in this paper conserve

invariant the qusi-gupta-bleuler state subspace formed according to the lorentz condition and therefore

we have been able to easily explain the denition and the unitarity of the scattering matrix. a formular

have been found to express the scattering matrix terms of the generating functional for the truncated

renormalized green functions.

we have also briey described the asymptotic eld viewpoint based on our operator description. it

would be interesting to compare such a viewpoint with that of the traditional asymptotic theory[912].
