(2) potential term eq. (2) four degenerate vacuum states, shown fig. 1. theory posses wide class domain walls, link dierent vacua theory. domain wall congurations may obtained solutions bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfeld (bps, ref. ) equations, look case eq. (2) like df dz dh dz = 1 f 2 h2 , = f h . 2 (3) = /, = 1 z space coordinate. shown refs. , case = 4 solutions f (z) h(z) may obtained analytical form: f (z) = a(e2z 1) + 2ez + ae2z , h2(z) = 2ez + 2ez + ae2z , (4) continuous parameter, 0 +. solution (4) links vacua states 1 2. depending specic form f (z) h(z) looks quite dierent. considering region 0 < < 1, may introduce dierent parameterization: cosh = . (5) 1 terms parameter functions f (z) h(z) look like f (z) = 1 2 (cid:18)tanh z 2 + tanh z + 2 (cid:19) , 2 h2(z) = 1 2 (cid:18)1 tanh z 2 tanh z + 2 (cid:19) . (6) eqs. (6) clear large functions f h split two orthogonal z-axis elementary walls corresponding transitions 1 3 z = 3 2 z = s. thus large eqs. (6) describe two far separated domain walls. purpose research study dynamics collision two separated domain walls 1 3 3 2. evidently, question outside bps approximation study problem solve exact eld equations, follow form lagrangian (2). recently ref. {$9812116$} problem intersection two domain walls model considered. authors didnt solve exact equations motion, used simple reasonable approach considering parameter dynamical eective variable. follows shall use methods, considering (or s) function time t, well solving exact equations motion elds f h. shall demonstrate eective lagrangian method consistent solution cauchy problem exact eld system. terms (5) energy domain wall conguration (4) form e = e0 + e1 , e1 = 1 2 + z a2 cosh3 z + cosh 2z (a cosh z + 1)4 dz . (7) e0 depend sum energy densities two far separated walls 1 3 3 2. specic form inessential future consideration. replacing a(t) s(t) according eq. (5), get following eective lagrangian new dynamical variable s: lef f = m(s) s2 , 1 2 (8) (9) m(s) = 2(cid:20)s tanh + 5 3 2s tanh + 1 tanh2 (cid:18) tanh 1(cid:19)(cid:21) . eective lagrangian (8) yields following dierential equation function s(t): m(s)s + 1 2 m(s) s2 = 0 . (10) observe process walls collision start initial conguration (4) s(0) 1 s(0) < 0. parameter meaning distance walls, conguration corresponds 1 3 3 2 walls moving along z-axis towards other. numerical solving eq. (10) shows s(t) decreases zero. range small solution obtained analytically: m(s) 16 15 s2 , s(t) = q2s(t) s(t)(t t) + s2(t) , (11) 3 denotes moment transition numerical solving eq. (10) analytical solution (11). decreases + 0, parameter changes 0 1. = 0 (point fig. 2) elds: f (z) = tanh(z/2) , h(z) = 1 2 cosh (z/2) . (12) range 1 < < + parameter s, dened eq. (5), becomes pure imaginary. therefore suitable introduce eective lagrangian analogous (8): cos = 1 . lef f = 2 m(s)s 1 2 m(s) = 2(cid:20)s tan 5 3 + 2s tan + 1 tan2 (cid:18) tan 1(cid:19)(cid:21) . (13) (14) (15) moment = 1 (or = 0) pass increases 0 /2. = /2 (point b fig. 2) elds f h form: f (z) = tanh z , h(z) 0 . (16) that, decreases 0 becomes pure imaginary. therefore moment = 0 (point c fig. 2) return back s, begins increase 0 +. note, also used analytical solutions 1 |s /2| 1. summary (s, s) t-dependencies two initial relative velocities s(0) = 0.05 s(0) = 0.1 represented fig. 3. developed dynamical variable approximation seems reasonable, needs numerical conrmation. performed calculation evolution described initial conguration solving numerically cauchy problem system two dierential equations partial derivatives elds f h. equations consequence lagrangian (2). results numerical solving cauchy problem elds f h compared elds proles obtained current value parameter (s, s) times t. large values s(0) observed good agreement. conrms parameter (s, s) good dynamical variable describing process bps domain walls collision susy model considered. note, s(0) increased numerical calculations exact eld problem observe progressing dierence eld proles restored help dynamical variable method. question whether problem computational scheme related excitation zero mode eld degrees freedom consideration now. 4 acknowledgments thankful m. b. voloshin useful discussions. would also like thank a. a. panlov help computer graphics. work supported part russian foundation basic research grants 98-02-17316 96-15-96578 (both authors). work v. a. gani also supported intas grant 96-0457 within research program international center fundamental physics moscow. one authors (a. e. kudryavtsev) would like thank rs grant nancial support. 5 figure captions fig. 1. locations vacuum states model. fig. 2. scheme 1 3 3 2 walls collision process. numbers 1, 2, 3 denote corresponding vacua. fig. 3. dynamical variable (s, s) function time two dierent values initial velocity s(0).
