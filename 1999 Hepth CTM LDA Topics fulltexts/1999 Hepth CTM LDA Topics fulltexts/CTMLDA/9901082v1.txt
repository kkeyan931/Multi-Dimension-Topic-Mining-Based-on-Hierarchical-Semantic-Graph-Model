abstract

the floreanini-jackiw formulation for the chiral quantum-mechanical
system oscillator is a model of constrained theory with only second-
class constraints.
in the diracs classication.the covariant quantiza-
tion needs an innit number of auxiliary variables and a wess-zumino
term. in this paper we investigate the path integral quatization of this
model using gulers canonical formalism. all variables are gauge vari-
ables in the gulers formalism. the siegels action is obtained using
hamilton-jacobi formulation of the systems with constraints.

1 introduction

chiral bosons in two-dimensional space-time and (2 + 1) -dimensional chern-
simons(cs) gauge theories are related problems which have been attracting
much attention.these problems are important for the string program and
for the development of the quantum hall eect[1],[2].floreanini and jackiw
suggested an action suitable for the quantization of a two-dimensional chiral
boson[3].siegel proposed an apparently unrelated action for the same system[4].
in[5] the connection between these two approach was investigated. the quan-
tization of siegel action was investigated by faddeev-jackiw formalism in[6].

the equivalent lagrangian method [7] is used to obtain the set of hamilton-
jacobi partial dierential equations.in other words the equations of motion are
written as total dierential equations in many variables.

the main aim of this paper is to investigate the quantization of the floreanini-

jackiw chiral oscillator using gulers formalism.

the plan of our paper is the following:
in section 2 we present the quantization of the eld theories with con-
straints using hamilton-jacobi method. in section 3 the path integral quan-
tization for floreanini-jackiw chiral oscillator is given.the siegels action was
obtained using gulers formalism. in section 4 we present our conclusions.

2 hamilton-jacobi quantization of the eld the-

ories with constraints

starting from hamilton-jacobi partial-dierential equation the singular sys-
tems was investigated using a formalism introduced by guler(see for example
refs.[7],[8]).

the canonical formulation gives the set of hamiltonian-jacobi partial-

dierential equation as

h



(, ,

s


,

s


where

) = 0, ,  = 0, n  r + 1,    , n, a = 1,    , n  r,

(1)

h



 = h(, a, a) + 

(2)

and h0 is the canonical hamiltonian. the equations of motion are obtained as
total dierential equations in many variables as follows

da =

d, da = 



h

d, d = 



h

d,  = 1,    , r

(3)

dz = (ha + a

)da

where z = s(a, a).the set of equations(3,4) is integrable if

dh



0 = 0, dh



 = 0,  = 1,    r

(4)

(5)

if conditions(5) are not satised identically , one consider them as a new
constraints and again tests the consistency conditions. thus repeating this
procedure one may obtain a set of conditions.

let suppose that for a system with constraints we found all independent
 using the calculus of variations [7],[8].at this stage we will

hamiltonians h
use diracs procedure of quatization [9]. we have



h



 = 0,  = 1,    , r

(6)

where  is the wave function. the consistency conditions are

[h



, h



] = 0, ,  = 1,    , r

if the hamiltonians h



 satises

[h



, h



] = c 

h





they are of rst class in the diracs classication. on the other hand if

[h



, h



] = c

(7)

(8)

(9)

where c do not depend of i and i then from(7) we will arise naturally at
diracs brackets and the canonical quatization will be performed taking diracs
brackets into commutators.

gulers formalism give us an action when all hamiltonians h

 are in in-
volution. because in gulers formalism we work from the beginning in the
extended space we suppose that variables t depend of  .here  is canonical
conjugate with p0.



if we are able , for a given system with constraints, to nd the independent
 in involution then we can perform the quantization of this
hamiltonians h
system using path integral quantization method with the action given by (4)



z = z (h + 



h



) ad

where  = d

3 chiral oscillator

we consider the lagrangian[10]

l0 =  qi

(0)ijq(0)

j + 2q(0)

i q(0)

i

, i, j = 1, 2

from(11) we found the constraints

i = p(0)

i  ijq(0)

j

, i = 1, 2

and the canonical hamiltonian

hc = (p(0)

i  ijq(0)

j ) q(0)

i  2q(0)

k q(0)

k

then in the gulers formalism we have following hamiltonians

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

h



0 = p0 + hc, h



i = p(0)

i  ijq(0)

j

, i = 1, 2

(14)

and all the variables q(0)
involution because

i

are gauge variables. the hamiltonians are not in

[h



i , h



j] = 2ij

(15)

in order to obtain the hamiltonians in involution we will extend the space with
new variable p(1)
in
involution are

. the new expressions for the hamiltonians h

and q(1)

i = h



i  ijq(1)

j  p(1)

i

but we get a new set of constraints

h 1

i = p(1)

i  ijq(1)

j

if we repeat the procedure after n steps we get n+1 hamiltonians in involution
and the hamiltonians h n 

i  ijq(n )

i = p(n )

fullling

j

[h n 

i

, h n 

j

] = 2ij

(18)

the nal form of the canonical hamiltonian obtained after an innite rep-

etition of the conversion process is

h ()

c = 

k=0(p(k)

i ijq(k)

i

) qk

i 

k=02q(k)

i q(k)

i 2

k=1k1

m=0ijq(m)

j

l
(19)
then in the gulers formalism we have an innity numbers of hamiltonians in
involution

( q(m)

i +ilq(m)

)

h



0 = p0 + h ()

c

, h



k = p(k)

i  ijq(k)

j

, k = 1,    , 

(20)

using (10) we found after some calculations that the action has the form

where l is given by

z = z ld

l = 

k=0(ijq(k)

i

j + 2q(k)
qk

i

) + 2

k=1k1

m=0ijq(m)

(21)

) (22)

( q(m)

i + ilq(m)

l

this result is in agreement with those from [10].

3.1 siegels action

siegel was rst one to propose an action for the chiral-boson problem [4]. the
lagrangean density is

and the canonical hamiltonian becomes

l = + + ()2

hc =

(1 + )1( + 



)2 +

(23)

(24)

where  is the canonical momentum conjugate with . on the other hand we
observe that

in gulers formalism we have the following hamiltonians

 = 0

h



0 = p0 + hc, h



1 = 

imposing dh



0 = 0 and dh



1 = 0 we generate another hamiltonian h



2

h



2 =   



(25)

(26)

(27)

from (26) and (27) we conclude that  and  are gauge variables in gulers
formalism.

now we are interested in performing the quantization of the system. using

diracs procedure we have

because

and

h



0 = 0, h



1 = 0, h



2 = 0

[h



1, h



0] =

1
2

(1 + )1(  



)2

[h



2, h



2] = x(x  y)

(28)

(29)

(30)

we conclude that the system has second class constraints in the diracs classi-
cation and we can quantize it using path integral quantization method [11].
because we have obtained the same constraints h
2 as in [5] we
found the same result after performing path integral quantization.

4 concluding remarks

using hamilton-jacobi formalism for systems with constraints we found that
floreanini-jackiw chiral harmonic oscillator is a theory with an innite number
of hamiltonians in involution. the path integral quantization, using the action
given by gulers formalism ,was performed and the results are in agreement
with those obtained by others authors .

for floreanini-jackiw chiral harmonic oscillator we found that all the elds
 are
are gauge elds in the gulers formalism. because all hamiltonians h
constraints in the extended space in the gulers formalism we have no rst
and second class constraints in the diracs classication at the classical level.
however the rst and second class constraints become important in this
formalism in the process of quantization . for the siegels action we found only
three independent hamiltonians h
2.this set of hamiltonians give us
the correct result if the path integral quantization for this system is performed.

do not give us new constraints.

the problem if the constraint (h

2)2(for more details see ref.[5]) is of rst
or second class does not arise in the gulers formalism. in this case we found
that all variables are gauge variables in gulers formalism.
