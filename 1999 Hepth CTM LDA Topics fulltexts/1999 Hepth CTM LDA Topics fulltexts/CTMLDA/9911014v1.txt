abstract

the schrodinger equation is investigated in the euclidean taub-
nut geometry. the bound states are degenerate and an extra de-
generacy is due to the conserved runge-lenz vector. the existence
of the extra conserved quantities, quadratic in four-velocities implies
the possibility of separating variables in two dierent coordinate sys-
tems. the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are given in both cases in
explicit, closed form.

1 introduction

the discovery of the self-dual instanton solutions to euclidean yang-mills
theory suggested the possibility that analogous solutions to the euclidean
einstein equations might be important in quantum gravity. one example
of a metric which satises the euclidean einstein equations with self-dual
riemann tensor is the self-dual taub-nut metric [1]. in this case einsteins
equations are satised with zero cosmological constant and the manifold is
r4 with a boundary which is a twisted three-sphere s3 possessing a distorted
metric.

on the other hand much attention has been paid to the euclidean taub-
nut metric because it is involved in many modern studies in physics. the
kaluza-klein monopole of gross and perry [2] and of sorkin [3] was obtained
by embedding the taub-nut gravitational instanton into ve-dimensional
kaluza-klein theory. remarkably, the same object has re-emerged in the
study of monopole scattering. in the long-distance limit, neglecting radiation,
the relative motion of two monopoles is described by the geodesics of this
space [4, 5].

it is well known that space-time isometries give rise to constants of mo-
tion along geodesics. however it is worth to mention that not all conserved
quantities arose from isometries of the manifolds and associated killing vec-
tor elds. other integrals of motion are related to hidden symmetries of
the manifold, which manifest themselves as tensor of rank n > 1, satisfying
a generalized killing equation, namely (k1...n) = 0 [6]. they are usually
referred to as stackel-killing tensors.
an illustration of the existence of extra conserved quantities is provided
by the taub-nut geometry. indeed, for the geodesic motions in the taub-
nut space, there is a conserved vector, analogous to the runge-lenz vector
of the kepler type problem, whose existence is rather surprising in view of
the complexity of the equations of motion [7, 8, 9, 10]. the runge-lenz
vector is quadratic in four-velocities and its components are stackel-killing
tensors.

the taub-nut space is also of mathematical interest. in the taub-nut
geometry there are known to exist four killing-yano tensors. the killing-
yano tensor [11] here is a 2-form, f = f[], which satises the penrose-
floyd equation (f) = 0. three of these killing-yano tensors are rather
special: they are covariantly constant, mutually anti-commuting and square

2

the minus unity. thus they are complex structure realizing the quaternionic
algebra and the taub-nut manifold is hyper-kahler [8]. the fourth killing-
yano tensor has a non-vanishing eld strength, is not trivial and leads to new
constants of motion. more precisely, the symmetrized product of the fourth
killing-yano tensor with the previous three is connected with the stackel-
killing tensors, i.e. the components of the runge-lenz vector [8, 12, 13, 14].
the aim of this paper is to study the schrodinger equation in taub-
nut space. the conserved runge-lenz vector implies an extra degeneracy
of the bound states.
it is remarkably the fact that there appears to be a
close relation between the existence of extra conserved quantities and the
possibility of separating variables in two dierent coordinate systems.
in
this way one obtains two dierent orthonormal energy bases, called here the
central and axial bases, for which the degeneracy of the energy levels is well
dened by the eigenvalues of suitable sets of commuting operators.

the plan of the paper is as follows.

in section 2 we summarize the
relevant features of the euclidean taub-nut geometry.
in section 3 we
analyze the schrodinger equation in this space looking for the complete sets
of commuting operators that dene the mentioned bases. in the next two
sections the schrodinger equation is investigated in spherical and parabolic
coordinates. we show that the central modes can be solved in spherical
coordinates while for the axial modes we need to use parabolic coordinates.
in both cases we obtain sets of regular modes as well as specic sets of
irregular modes arising from the special boundary conditions of the taub-
nut geometry. our concluding remarks are presented in the last section.
finally, the appendix is devoted to so(3)  u(1) harmonics.

2 taub-nut geometry

the euclidean taub-nut manifold is a particular case of static euclidean
kaluza-klein space-time whose metric, in a static chart of coordinates, t and
x, (, , ... = 1, 2, 3, 5), is given by the line element

ds2 = dt2 + gdxdx = dt2 +

1
v

dl2 + v (dx5 + aidxi)2 ,

where

dl2 = (d


x)2 = (dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2

(1)

(2)

3

is the usual euclidean 3-dimensional line element involving the cartesian
space coordinates xi (i, j, ... = 1, 2, 3) which cover the domain d. the other
coordinates are the time, t, and the cartesian kaluza-klein extra-coordinate,
x5  d5. we suppose that v and ai are static functions depending only on

x. it is clear that in the absence of the scalar potential we have

div


a = 0 ,

rot


a =

from (1) we obtain the covariant components of the metric tensor

gij =

v

ij + v aiaj ,

gi5 = v ai ,

g55 = v ,

and

1
v 2 .
the corresponding contravariant components are

gij = v ij ,

gi5 = v ai ,

g55 =

where r = |

(8)

in fact, the geometry dened by (1) and (7) has the global symmetry of the
group so(3)  u5(1)  tt(1). this means that the line element is invariant
under global rotations of the cartesian space coordinates and x5 and t trans-
lations of the abelian groups u5(1) and tt(1) respectively. the generators
of these groups are just the ve killing vectors corresponding to this global

symmetry. moreover, there is a three-component killing tensor

k )= 0 (where  is the covariant derivative and (
the symmetrisation).

3 observables

the quantum mechanics in the taub-nut geometry [10] is based on the

schrodinger equation

h = it

involving the hamiltonian operator

h = 

1
2g ,

(9)

(10)

written in natural units with h = c = 1. in any static chart, eq.(9) has the
particular solutions

(11)

(12)

where ue are energy eigenfunctions,

e(x) = ue(


x, x5)eiet ,

hue = eue .

the solutions (11) may be either square integrable functions or tempered
distributions on d  d5. in both cases they must be orthonormal (in usual
or generalized sense) with respect to the scalar product

h, i = zdd5

d4xg  .

(13)

we denote by l2 the hilbert space of the square integrable functions with
respect to this scalar product.
the main operators on l2 can be introduced by using the geometric
in this way, one obtains the non-hermitian momentum

quantization [10].
operators in the coordinate representation,

pi = i(i  ai5) , p5 = i5 ,

which obey the commutation rules

[pi, pj] = iijkbkp5 ,

[pi, p5] = 0 .

with their help we can write

h =

p

+

1

2 (cid:18)v

v

p5

2(cid:19) .

5

(14)

(15)

(16)

hereby we see that the u5(1) generator, p5, is conserved since it commutes
with h. this is natural since p5 is up to the factor i just a killing vector.
in the following it is convenient to replace it by q = p5. furthermore,
one can verify that other three killing vectors are the components of the
angular momentum operator


l =



x 


p +


x
r

q .

(17)

these are conserved and satisfy the canonical commutation rules. moreover,
their commutators with the coordinates and the momentum operators are
the usual ones. other three important conserved operators are those dened
by the three-component killing tensor

(18)

thus we obtain a vector operator which play the same role as the runge-lenz
vector in the usual quantum mechanical kepler problem. this transforms as
a vector under space rotations since its components obey

[li, kj] = iijkkk .

(19)

now we have to chose the suitable complete sets of commuting operators
which should dene usual or generalized bases for the hilbert space l2. here
two options are interesting, namely (i) that of the central basis given by
the set {h,
, l3, q} or (ii) the axial basis formed by the common eigen-
functions of the set {h, k3, l3, q}. in both cases we must work in suitable
coordinate systems which should allow us to separate the variables in all the
dierential equations corresponding to the eigenvalue problems.

4 central modes

in order to study the central modes it is convenient to choose the local
chart with spherical coordinates, r, , , commonly related to the cartesian
ones and the new coordinate  dened as

x1 .

(20)

here the taub-nut line element is

ds2 = dt2 +

since

(dr2 + r2d2 + r2 sin2  d2) + 2v (d + cos  d)2 ,

(21)

ar = a = 0 , a = (1  cos ) .

(22)
moreover, we consider that in this chart r  dr = {r|v (r) > 0} (i.e., r > 0
if  > 0 or r > || if  < 0), the angular coordinates ,  cover the sphere
s2 while   d = [0, 4).

the main observables are

q = i

(23)

and the components of the angular momentum (17) in the canonical basis
(with l = l1  il2),

l3 = i ,
l = ei(cid:20)  + i(cid:18)cot

looking for the common eigenfunctions of the set (i), we observe that the
angular momentum as well as q act only upon functions of ,  and  which
must be square integrable since the domain s2  d is compact. these form
the hilbert space l2(s2d) where the complete set of commuting operators

will be called so(3) u(1) harmonics. notice that the boundary conditions
on s2  d require l and m to be integer numbers while q = 0,1/2,1, ...
[10]. the form of these harmonics is given in appendix.
thus the problem of the angular motion is completely solved and it is
clear that the angular coordinates can be separated from the radial one if we
take the common eigenfunctions of the set (i) of the form

u q

e,l,m(r, , , ) =

1
r

rq

e,l(r)y q

l,m(, , ) .

then from eq.(12) we obtain the familiar radial equation,

r(cid:19) rq

e,l(r)rq

(35)

this is a kepler-like problem similar to that of the non-relativistic quan-
tum mechanics. the general solution of eq.(33) can be written in terms of
the conuent hypergeometric function as

where

rq

e,l(r) = nsef (a, 2s, ) ,

 = 2rq ,

a = s 



2

(36)

(37)

,

and n is the normalization constant. the parameter s is a solution of the
equation s(s 1) = l(l + 1). the modes with s = l + 1 are similar to those of
the usual non-relativistic case. for this reason we say that these are regular
modes. we shall see that in the taub-nut geometry there is a conjecture
in which irregular modes with s = l are also allowed. in the following we
shall briey discuss the corresponding energy spectra assuming that e  0.
let us consider rst the regular modes (s = l + 1). it is easy to show that
for  > 0 there is only a continuous energy spectrum, covering the domain
e  q2/22, the levels of which are innite degenerated as it result from the
selection rules (68). notice that these rules are in accordance with the behav-
ior of the classical trajectories which are open and cannot reach the center.
in the case of  < 0 we have the same continuous energy spectrum with
innite degenerate levels and, in addition, a discrete spectrum in the domain
[0, q2/22) where  > 0 and  < 0. here we can impose the quantization
condition a = nr, nr = 0, 1, 2, ... which gives

= 2n

(38)





where n = nr + l + 1 is the main quantum number of the regular modes.
hereby we nd the energy levels

en =

1

2 (cid:20)nqn2  q2  (n2  q2)(cid:21)

(39)

for all n > |q| > 0 [10]. these levels are nite degenerated since for given q
and n the angular quantum numbers can take all the values selected by the
conditions |q| 1 < l  n 1 and (68). thus one obtains a countable energy
spectrum with the property

lim
n

en =

q2
22 .

9

(40)

the irregular modes arise only as discrete modes when  < 0 since the
radial functions (36) remain square integrable on dr = [||,) for s = l if
a = nr and |q| + l < nr < 2l. the main quantum number of these modes,
n = nr  l, obeys |q| < n < l and gives the same quantization rule (38)
and energy levels (39). therefore, the discrete spectrum of irregular modes
coincides to that of the regular ones, spanning just the domain of energies
where the classical motion has closed trajectories. the dierence is that in
the case of irregular modes the energy levels are innite degenerated (since
l > n) and there is no continuous energy spectrum.

5 axial modes

let us consider now the axial modes given by the eigenvalue problem of
the set (ii). this can be solved in a local chart with parabolic coordinates,
  d,   d and   [0, 2), dened by

x1 = q cos  ,

x2 = q sin  ,

x3 =

1
2

(  ) ,

such that

r =

1
2

( + ) .

(41)

(42)

here the domains d and d corresponding to dr are either ,  > 0 for
 > 0 or ,  > || if  < 0. the line element reads
dl2 + 2v  d +

ds2 = dt2 +

d!2

where

dl2 =

(44)

following the same procedure like in the case of the central modes we
calculate how look the operators of the set (ii) in these coordinates. it is not
dicult to show that

h =

and

k3 =

depend on the parameters s1 = (|m| + q)/2 and s2 = (|m|  q)/2.
we dene the regular axial modes for s1 = (|m| + q)/2 > 1/2 and
s2 = (|m|  q)/2 > 1/2 which means that |m| > |q|  1. these correspond
to the regular central modes we have discussed in the previous section. the
discrete energy spectrum appears in the same conditions ( > 0 and  < 0)
but now the quantization rules are

a1 = n1 ,

a2 = n2 , n1, n2 = 0, 1, 2, ... .

(62)

hereby we recover the quantization rule (38) with the main quantum number
of the regular modes n = n1 +n2 +|m|+1 and the same formula of the energy
levels (39). moreover, we nd that

 = q|| (n2  n1  q) .

(63)

thus the regular discrete axial modes are labeled by the quantum numbers
n1, n2, m and q. notice that  and  depend only on q and n as it results
from eqs.(34) and (39).

the irregular discrete modes can be derived for  < 0 in the same manner
like in the case of the central modes, by looking for the conditions in which
the wave functions (58) remain square integrable on the domains ,  > ||
for s1, s2 < 0. we observe that this happens only when a1 = n1, a2 =
n2, s1 = (|m| + q)/2 and s2 = (|m|  q)/2 such that n1 < |m| + q  1
and n2 < |m|  q  1. hereby it results that the main quantum number
of these modes, n = n1 + n2  |m| + 1, accomplishes the selection rules
|q| < n < |m|  1 and  = q|| (n2  n1 + q).

6 concluding remarks

the study of the schrodinger equation in euclidean taub-nut space
is well motivated. the killing tensors of the taub-nut geometry imply
the existence of extra conserved quantities, quadratic in four-velocities. the
taub-nut case is analogous to the coulomb problem where an extra de-
generacy is present and there is the possibility of separating variables in two
dierent coordinate systems. this analogy is not perfect since in the taub-
nut geometry the selection rules of the angular quantum numbers depend
on q and the boundary conditions allow irregular modes. however, this has
nothing surprising in general relativity where we know already the irregular
modes of spinless [16] or spin-half [17] particles in anti-de sitter space-times.
in the last time, iwai and katayama [18, 19, 20, 21] extended the taub-
nut metric so that it still admits a kepler-type symmetry. this class of
metrics, of course, includes the original taub-nut metric. in general the
killing tensors involved in the runge-lenz vector cannot be expressed as a
contracted product of killing-yano tensors. the only exception is the original
taub-nut space [22].
it will be interested to investigate the schrodinger
equation in the more complicated case of the generalized taub-nut spaces.
the extension of the results for this class of space-times will be discussed
elsewhere [23].

a so(3)  u (1) harmonics

the so(3)  u(1) harmonics dened by eqs.(28)-(31) can not be ex-
pressed in terms of usual spherical harmonics. these are new harmonics
that must be separately studied by solving the system of eigenvalue equa-
tions. we start with

y q
l,m(, , ) =

1
4

q

l,m(cos)eimeiq

(64)

since then eqs.(29) and (30) are satised. it remains to solve only eq.(28)
and calculate the normalization factor of q

l,m according to the condition

z 1

d(cos )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

q

l,m(cos )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

13

2

= 2 .

(65)

to this end, we introduce the new variable z = sin2 /2 in eq.(28) where
is given by (26). thus we obtain

l,m(z) = 0 .

this equation has solutions of the form

q
l,m(z)  zp(1  z)k f (p + k  l, p + k + l + 1, 2p + 1, z) ,

(67)

where the gauss hypergeometric functions, f , depend on the real parameters
p and k which satisfy p2 = (m  q)2/4 and k2 = (m + q)2/4.
first of all we observe that the solutions (67) are square integrable only
when f are polynomials selected by a quantization condition since otherwise
f becomes strongly divergent for z  1. this means that l  p  k must
be a non-negative integer number.
if we replace the functions f of (67)
by jacobi polynomials [24], we observe that the solutions of eq.(66) remain
square integrable if 2p > 1 and 2k > 1. like in the case of the usual
spherical harmonics, the good choice is p = (|m|  q)/2 and k = (|m| + q)/2
where
(68)

|q|  1 < |m|  l .

then by using the normalization condition (65) we nd the nal result

q

l,m(cos ) =

2l + 1

for m = |m| the so(3)  u(1) harmonics are given by (64) and (69) while
for m < 0 we have to use the obvious formula

y q

l,m(cid:17)
l,m = (1)m(cid:16)y q

.

(70)

when the boundary conditions allow half-integer quantum numbers l and m
then we say that the functions dened by eqs.(64) and (69) (up to a suitable
factor) represent su(2)  u(1) harmonics.

14

thus we have obtained a non-trivial generalization of the spherical har-
monics of the same kind as the spin-weighted spherical harmonics [25]. in-
deed, if l, m and q = m are either integer or half-integer numbers then we
have

2l + 1

4

y m
l,m(, , ) =

dl

m,m(, , )

(71)

where dl
m,m are the matrix elements of the irreducible representation of
weight l of the su(2) group corresponding to the rotation of euler angles
(, , ). what is new in the case of our harmonics is that these are dened
for any real number q.
