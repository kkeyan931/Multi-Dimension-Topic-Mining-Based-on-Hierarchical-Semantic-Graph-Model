abstract

the master equation is quantized. this is an example of quantization of a gauge

theory with nilpotent generators. no ghosts are needed for a generation of the gauge

algebra. the point about the nilpotent generators is that one cant write down a

single functional integral for this theory. one has to write down a product of two

coupled functional integrals and take a square root. in the special gauge where the

gauge conditions are commuting, the functional integrals decouple, and one recovers

the known result.

1 introduction

when, in a gauge theory, the local generators of gauge transformations are reducible,

the quantization rules are known only in the case where the reducibility has a nite

number of stages [1]. the case of innite reducibility is also of interest [1-4] but in this

case the usual methods of covariant quantization dont work. an important subcase of

innite reducibility is the one where the generators of gauge transformations are nilpotent.

only this subcase is considered in the present paper, and, furthermore, a solution to the

quantization problem is obtained only for a theory with equal numbers of boson and

fermion variables. this is the theory whose action solves the master equation [1].

the master equation has two aspects. on the one hand, it yields a universal formula-

tion of any gauge theory (at least nite-reducible). a given gauge theory is quantized by

building a dynamically equivalent solution of the master equation. on the other hand,

a solution of the master equation itself is the action of a gauge theory with nilpotent

generators [1]. the quantization rules in this theory have been known for one special

class of gauges [1] which thus far was sucient for all practical purposes. however, going

beyond this class was notoriously dicult because the master equation, being a theory

with nilpotent generators, has never been quantized properly. this problem is solved

below.

the solution is simple but has novel and unexpected features which are probably

common for all cases of nilpotent generators. it is known that the higher the tower of

reducibility the more ghost elds are needed for unitarity [1]. therefore, naively, an

innite tower requires an innite number of ghosts. the correct answer is that, for a

generation of the gauge algebra with nilpotent generators, no ghosts are needed at all.

the solution is that, because of the nilpotency, one cant write down the functional integral

for a single copy of the system. one has to double the system and write down a product

of two coupled functional integrals for the doubled system. one is then to take a square

root. only in the special class of gauges where the gauge conditions are commuting, the

functional integrals decouple, and one recovers the previously known result.

2 the master equation and the commuting gauge

the master equation is the following equation:

(s, s)  2

rs
i

ls
 i

= 0

(1)

for a boson function s(, ) of elds i and the antields i having the statistics opposite

to the statistics of i. the notation (s, s) refers to the operation of antibrackets [1].

introducing the collective notation for the set of elds and antields:

a = i, i

,

a = 1, . . . 2n

s() = s(, )

,

one can rewrite the master equation as follows [1]:

(s, s) 

rs
a

ab ls

b = 0 ,

ab = 


0

k
i

i
k

0




.

dierentiating eq. (4) yields the noether identities

rs
a

ra

c = 0

,

c = ab lrs
ra
bc

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

which show that every solution of the master equation is a gauge action with the generators

(7). dierentiating eq. (6) shows that these generators are nilpotent on shell:

ra

b rb

= 0 .

=0

c (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) s



the solution s of the master equation is assumed proper [1]:

rank 2s =

2n
2

in which case half of the variables  is redundant and needs to be gauged away:

i() = 0

.

(8)

(9)

(10)

for the special class of gauge conditions mentioned above, the gauge-xing functions i()

are of the form [1]

i() = i(, ) = i 

()

i

(11)

with an arbitrary fermion function (). below, these gauge conditions are referred to as

com() where com stands for commuting. their canonical-invariant characterization

is

(com

i

, com

j

) = 0 ,

(12)

i.e., the gauge-xing functions commute in the sense of antibrackets [1]. in this class of

gauges, the functional integral generating the greens functions is of the form [1]

z(j) = z d exp i(cid:16)s() + aja(cid:17) (cid:16)com()(cid:17) .

(13)

here and below, the measure [1] is omitted but can always be restored in the usual way.

no ghosts are needed in the commuting gauge. it is shown in the appendix that the

master equation always admits a gauge of the form (11) at least locally. apart from that,

it has always been a mystery, what makes this gauge distinguished but attempts at a

generalization didnt go through.

the answers come with quantizing the master equation. the procedure below is an

example of quantization of a gauge theory with nilpotent generators.

3 quantizing the master equation

for quantizing the master equation i shall build the master equation for the master

equation. taking s() for the original action of a gauge eld a, i shall introduce the

antield 

a and look for an action

m(, )

(14)

that would have s() as its classical limit but would also satisfy the master equation

and be its proper solution:

rm
a

lm

a

= 0

rank 2m =

4n
2

.

4

(15)

(16)

the key point is that one needs no ghosts for building the solution for m. to see

this, recall why ghosts are needed at all [1]. they are needed for including the gauge

generators in the hessian of the action but, in the present case, the gauge generators of

the original s() are already contained in its hessian, eq. (7). therefore, it should be

possible to satisfy all the conditions for m without introducing new elds. indeed, here

is the solution for m:

m(, ) = s(a + ab

b) + s(a  ab
b)

.

(17)

it is easy to check that, with this expression, eq. (15) is satised by virtue of the original

master equation (4), and the rank condition (16) is satised because the arguments of the

two s s in (17) are independent. there remains to be inserted in (17) the overall 1/2 to

satisfy the condition of the classical limit but this is precisely what should not be done. it

is another key point that the classical limit should be kept doubled (see below).

in terms of the original elds and antields, eq. (3), the solution obtained is of the

form

m(, ) = s( +  ,   ) + s(   ,  + )

,

 = , 

,

 = , 

(18)

(19)

where  is the new antield to the original eld  , and  is the new antield to the
original antield  . the antield to the antield has, of course, the statistics of the eld.

the remaining procedure is standard. for the introduction of gauge conditions one

needs ghosts of the auxiliary sector [1]. one extends m(, ) in the usual way:

m(, ) + c 

i i = mtot(, , c ; ,  , c )

(20)

where the bar over c is needed only to hold to the conventional terminology [1] since
now there is only the ghost c ; there is no c . then, by construction [1], the following

functional integral:

z 2(j) = z ddd cdd d c  exp i(cid:16)mtot + 2aja(cid:17)





 (cid:16) 

(cid:17)(cid:16) c  

 c(cid:17)(cid:16)  



 (cid:17)

(21)

5

does not depend on the choice of

 = (, , c)

.

(22)

it is not a misprint that, in (21), z(j) appears squared, and the source term aja is

doubled. the z(j) is the correct generating functional for the master equation. indeed,
if one decomposes a into the original i, i , and chooses

(, , c) = i c i 

1( + c) +

1
2

2(  c)

1
2

with arbitrary functions 1, 2 , then upon the redesignations

a + ab

b = a
1 ,

a  ab

b = a

2

(23)

(24)

(25)

one obtains

z 2(j) = z d1d2 exp i(cid:16)s(1) + s(2) + a

1ja + a

2ja(cid:17) (cid:16)com(1)(cid:17)(cid:16)com(2)(cid:17) . (26)

this is precisely the square of the functional integral (13) in the commuting gauge!

4 the master equation in the general gauge

by setting in (22)

(, , c) = c ii()

(27)

with arbitrary i() one obtains the generating functional z(j) in the general gauge:

z 2(j) = z dd c exp i(cid:18)s(cid:16)a+ab c i ri

b (cid:17)+s(cid:16)a ab c i ri

b (cid:17)+2aja(cid:19) (cid:16)()(cid:17) . (28)

in the general gauge, the z(j) itself cannot be written as a functional integral. one has

to write down a product of two coupled functional integrals and take a square root. the

mystery of the commuting gauge is in the fact that, in this gauge, the functional integrals

decouple. the explanation of the fact that, in the commuting gauge, there are no ghosts

is that the ghosts make another copy of the original eld. after the two copies decouple,

each copy remains without ghosts.

6

expanding in c in (28), one has

z 2(j) = z dd c exp i(cid:18)2s() + 2aja  c k rk

e

ea lrs
ab

bd ri
d

c i(1)ib

+ o( c 4)(cid:19) (cid:16)()(cid:17)

(29)

with the obvious sign factor. it is seen that, owing to the doubling in (17) and in the

source term, the classical limit obtains correctly but also, at the one-loop level, the ghost

contribution doubles the contribution of the gauge eld.
indeed, the statistics of the
ghosts c i is opposite to the statistics of the redundant variables (say, antields) and

is, therefore, the same as the statistics of the independent variables (elds). moreover,
instead of the usual cc in the quadratic term, one has now c c. the ghost determinant

will, therefore, appear to the power 1/2. finally, the inverse ghost propagator contains

the hessian of the original gauge action which is the basic consequence of the nilpotency

of the gauge generators. there are, of course, also the higher-order ghost couplings.

to summarize, the master equation possesses the baron munchhausens gift of lifting

itself up by the hair. the master equation (for the master equation) in the commuting

gauge yields the master equation in the general gauge. hence the notation m for the

munchhausen master solution.

appendix. existence of the commuting gauge

the master equation always admits a commuting gauge at least in some neighbourhood

of the stationary orbit. the proof is as follows.

introduce the matrix inverse to (5):

abbc = a
c

and denote

sab =

the basic property of sab is nilpotency, eq. (8):

lrs

ab (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) s



.

=0

sabbcscd = 0 .

(a.1)

(a.2)

(a.3)

since s is the proper solution, eq.

(9), the sab has a symmetric invertible minor of

dimension n  n :

rank (cid:16)a

i

sabb

j(cid:17) =

2n
2

,

i, j, k = 1, . . . n .

(a.4)

introduce the matrix inverse to this minor:

and, with its aid, dene the following quantities:

(cid:16)a

k

sabb

i(cid:17)gij = j
k ,

i = (cid:16)gijb
i = b

j

i(cid:16)ba +

(a.6)

(a.7)

sda(cid:17)a

.

eqs.

(a.6),(a.7) dene a linear transformation from the variables a to the new
variables i, i . this transformation is invertible and is, moreover, a canonical trans-

formation. indeed, one can check on the basis of the nilpotency relation (a.3) that the

inverse transformation is of the form

a = (cid:16)a

b

and, in terms of the antibrackets

(a, b) def=

(a.8)

(a.9)

the following relations hold:

(i, j) = 0 ,

(i, j) = i

j

,

( i, j) = 0 .

(a.10)

the canonical transformation above settles the question. indeed, a calculation of the

hessian of s in the new variables yields the following result:

lrs

ij (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) s



= a
i

sabb

lrs

 ij (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) s



= 0

,

=0

lrs

 i j (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) s



= 0 .

=0

(a.11)

by (7), the admissibility condition for a gauge-xing function i is of the form

rank

ri
a

ab lrs

bc (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) s



= n .

=0

(a.12)

when written in the variables ,  , with eqs. (a.11) and (a.4) taken into account, this

condition becomes

rank

ri(, )

 j

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) s



= n .

=0

(a.13)

it follows that any gauge condition solvable with respect to i is admissible. this includes

both commuting and noncommuting gauges for which

i = i  fi()

(a.14)

with any functions fi() .
