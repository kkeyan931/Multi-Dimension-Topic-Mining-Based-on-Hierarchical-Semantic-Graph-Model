abstract

a perturbation theory for massive thirring model (mtm) in radial quan-
tization approach is developed. investigation of the twisted sector in this the-
ory allows us to calculate the vacuum expectation values of exponential elds
hexp ia (0)i of the sine-gordon theory in rst order over massive thirring models
coupling constant. it appears that the apparent diculty in radial quantization
of massive theories, namely the explicite time dependence of the hamiltonian,
may be successfully overcome. the result we have obtained agrees with the ex-
act formula conjectured by lukyanov and zamolodchikov and coincides with the
analogous calculations recently carried out in dual angular quantization approach
by one of the authors.

1 introduction

it is almost two decades the two dimensional exactly solvable models of qft at-
tract much attention because of their wide applications in the condenced matter
physics and string theory. from the other hand, the knowlidge of the exact solu-
tions of such nontrivial interacting theories provide us with better understanding
of the general concepts of qft. while the complete on-shell solution (i.e. the
mass spectrum and exact s-matrix) for many of 2d integrable qftes (iqft) are
well known, the construction of form-factors and correlation functions are under
current intensive ivestigations now.

the main subject of investigation in this paper is the most studied example

of 2d iqft the sine-gordon model, which is dened by the action

ssg =z d2x(cid:26) 1

16

 + 2 cos (cid:27)

(1.1)

where  is a real bose eld. the spectrum of this model includes the soliton,
anti soliton and some number (depended on the coupling constant ) of their
bound states named breathers. the scattering in this model is factorized: the
many-particle scattering process is reduced to the two-particle ones and the sets
of two-momenta of incoming and outgoing particles are identical. it is well known
since 1975 that the sg model is equivalent to the massive thirring model (mtm)
[2] with the action

sm t m =z d2x(cid:26)i  m  

g

2(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:27) ,

(1.2)

where ,  are two component dirac spinors. this equivalence assumes the iden-
tication of the fundamental (anti) fermions of the action (1.2) with the (anti)
solitons of sine-gordon model and the following relations among parameters and
currents, established by coleman [2]:

soliton mass m and the parameter  in the action (1.1) [3]

in this paper we consider the vacuum expectation values (vev) of exponen-

tial elds in the sine-gordon model

(1.6)

(1.7)

where the exponential elds are normalized by the condition

ga = hexp ia (0)i ,
deia(x)eia(y)esg  |x  y|4a2

as |x  y|  0,

which emphasizes that the uv limit of this theory is governed by the c = 1
conformal free bosonic eld.

for two special values of sine-gordon coupling constant, namely for   0
(semiclassical limit) and 2 = 1/2 (free fermion case), this function admits a
direct calculation. the authors of [4] have used these special cases to guess
the following expression for the expectation values (1.6) for generic 2 < 1 and
|re(a)| < 1/(2)

in order to support the formula (1.8), some extra arguments, based on the
reection relations with liouville reection amplitude have been presented in the
subsequent papers [5], [6], but there is no rigorous mathematical proof yet. the
article [8] provides another evidence supporting the lukyanov-zamolodchikov for-
mula (1.8), where its correctness has been checked in rst order of mtm coupling
constant g, by us of perturbation theory in angular quantization approach.

in present paper we apply radial quantization to the same problem. the
hamiltonian of massive theories in the radial quantization approach has explicit
time dependence [11]. it appeared that this apparent diculty can be overcome.
we believe that such perturbative calculations substantially increase the con-
dence in reection relations method as whole, which appears to be very powerful
tool for investigation of 2d conformal field theory (cft) and iqft [9], [10].

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we introduce the radial quan-
tization of mtm. in section 3 we calculate the vev (1.6) at free fermion point
g = 0. the calculation of vev in the rst order of perturbation theory is pre-
sented in section 4. here a special attention has been paid to regularization
procedure of the product of local elds at the coinciding points, which has some
new features in comparison with the ordinary quantization in cartesian coor-
dinates. it appears that the hankel-transform is a useful tool to carry out the
calculations of section 4. the relevant mathematical details are presented in
appendix.

2 radial quantization of the massive thirring

model

in two dimensional space it is convenient to use the following representation of
dirac matrices

0 = 2 =  0 i

0 ! , 1 = i1 = i  0 1
1 0 !

i

and denote the components of dirac spinors as

   l

r ! ,   0.

(2.1)

(2.2)

in this notations the action (1.7) in euclidean space takes the factorized form

im

2 (cid:16)lr  rl(cid:17)

am t m = z d2z(cid:20)rr + ll 

+gllrri ,
where z = x2 + ix1, z = x2  ix1 are the complex coordinates on the euclidean
plane,   /z,   /z and d2z  2dx1dx2 is the volume element.
as we are interested in the vevs of local eldsdeia(0)e, which have rotational
symmetry, it is natural to use the polar coordinates ,  dened by

(2.3)

z = e+i;

z = ei

(2.4)

and interpret ,  as euclidean time and space coordinates respectively.

since the conformal dimensions of the fermi elds l and r are (1/2, 0) and

(0, 1/2), they behave under the conformal transformations (2.4) as

z! 1
l (z, z)   

2

z! 1
l (, ) ; r (z, z)   

2

r (, ) ,

(2.5)

l,r.

where  =  + i,  =   i. the same transformation lows hold for the elds
thus in (, ) coordinates the action (2.3) becomes

am t m =

d

z
d hil (  i) l  ir ( + i) r
ime(cid:16)lr  rl(cid:17) + 2gllrri .

treating the radial coordinate  as a time, we get the hamiltonian

h =

the usual canonical quantization scheme will bring us to the standard equal

time anti-commutation relations

(2.7)

(2.8)

nl () , l ()o =  (  ) ,

nr () , r ()o =  (  ) .

as usual, in order to develop perturbation theory one rst has to solve the
problem with unperturbed hamiltonian (i.e. to ignore the last quartic term in
(2.7)). we found it easier to handle this problem in schrodinger picture, instead
of more conventional in qft heisenberg or interaction pictures. thus our eld
operators l,r will not depend on time  and the state vectors will evolve
according to the schrodiger equation. let us dene the creation, annihilation
operators ck, dk, ck, dk through the fourier mode decompositions

where all sums are taken over all positive half-integers (n is the set of positive
as a consequence of equations (2.8) and (2.9), one can easily get the following

anti-commutation relations for the operators ck, dk, ck, dk:

{ck, cl} =nck, clo = {dk, dl} =ndk, dlo = 0,

has the following basic vectors

(2.11)

where nk  {0, 1} (nk  {0, 1}) are the occupation numbers of particles
created by the operators ck (dk) out of bare vacuum |0i, which by denition
satises the conditions

quires the form h = h0 + hint, where the quadratic part h0 is equal to

the evolution of arbitrary state |si along euclidean time  caused by the

hamiltonian h0 is given by the schrodinger equation

(2.14)
here and henceforth we prefer to use r  me rather than . to nd the
general solution to the schrodinger equation (2.14) let us denote, that the hamil-

the full fock space h (2.16), hence we have reduced the initial qft problem of
innitely many degrees of freedom to the simple quantum mechanical one, with
four dimensional hilbert space. a further simplication provides the observation,
that the reduced hamiltonians h (1)
k dont mix even and odd sectors (see
(2.17), (2.18)). the resulting schrodinger equations in this reduced spaces take
the form

evidently, to obtain the equations for the another sector with hamiltonian
h (2)
k , one simply has to change the upper indices (1) into (2) and make the
substitutions ck  dk and dk  ck. thus, the dierential equations for the
unknown functions k(r), k(r), k(r), k(r) in both cases remain the same:

k i = 0.

it is interesting to note, that due to explicit time dependence of the hamil-
tonian, the system being initially at the ground state of that particular moment,
after nite time of evolution will nd himself in an excited state. nevertheless,
long time evolution of any state with non vanishing overlap with the ground state
of the initial time, eventually approaches to the ground state of the innite future

where am t m is the euclidean action (2.6). the functional integral in the nu-
merator of (3.31) is taken over the space fa of the twisted eld congurations
 (z, z) and  (z, z), which acquire the phase

  (z, z) ,

(3.32)

when continued analytically around the point z = 0 in anti-clockwise direction
[4]. this is due to the non-trivial monodromy of dirac elds with respect to
the exponential elds exp ia (0) . it is easy to see, that to ensure such twisted
boundary conditions on dirac elds, one has to shift fourier mode indices as
follows

k  k

,

in sector 1 (i.e. in ck, dk sector)

in sector 2 (i.e. in dk, ck sector).

(3.33)

with the rst line of (2.9))

l () =

with such shifts, all the results of the previous sector remain valid since we have
never used the arithmetical properties of the fourier mode indices.

in radial hamiltonian formalism the regularized version of the functional in-

tegral (3.31) may be represented as

g(a, r0) = h| s(r, r0)|0ia
h| s(r, r0)|0i
8

,

(3.36)

where the matrix element of the evolution operator s(r, r0) in the numerator is
taken in twisted sector (this is indicated by the lower index a). to regularize the
expression, in (3.36) we have assumed, that the evolution begins at some small
r0. a simple conformal field theory consideration1, which takes into account
the fact, that the conformal dimension of the eld eia is a2, leads to

g0(a) = lim

in general case it is not known yet how to calculate the functional integral (3.31)
or the matrix elements in (3.36) exactly. below well evaluate (3.36) at the free
fermion point g = 0. as in this case we already know the time evolution of every
constituent of the vacuum |0i (see eq. (2.20)) from the previous section, it is not
dicult to pick up all the necessary factors from (2.29) with appropriate shifts
of fourier mode indices and obtain

the translational invariance of the theory if it is transformed back to the initial
euclidean coordinates x1, x2. the conventional normal ordering with respect
to creation-annihilation operators fails to satisfy this condition, because of the
non-trivial time dependence of physical vacuum. instead, we should suppress all

in (4.3) a small initial time r0 and a large nal time r0 are
introduced in order to keep intermediate expressions nite. r and r0 eventually
will be sent to 0 and  correspondingly. note also the explicit r dependence of
(4.3) and hence of (4.2), which reects the inhomogeneity of time in our scheme
of quantization. the standard time dependent perturbation theory in rst order

 = 12(1  g
2 + o(g)) and expand the resulting expression over g up to linear
term). the remaining calculation of integrals over the quartic bessel functions is
presented in the appendix. using these results we obtain

now performing summation over k and l in the third line of the eq. (4.6) we obtain
logarithmically diverging at t = 0 integral. in fact, the same problem we have

11

faced when carrying out calculations exactly at the free-fermion point. indeed the
the product in (3.39) diverges for large k, l, but we overcame this diculty using
-function regularization inside the integral representation of -function (3.41).
here well not care of a similar appropriate regularization. rather, noticing that
various regularization scheme will dier from each other by a term  a2, and that
the coecient of 1/2a2 in the expansion of heiai is just the vev h2i, which
has been calculated in [4] using standard feynman diagram technic with result
(below  = 0.577216... is the euler constant)

h2(0)i = 4(1 +  + log(m/2)) +

(4.7)

we simply cut the above mentioned integral over t on the lower bound and equate
the undened coecient of 1/2a2 to the one predicted by the eq.(4.7). the nal
result is

which is in complete agreement with the lukyanov-zamolodchikov formula (1.8).

appendix

it appears that the hankel-transforms are appropriate tools allowing us to per-
form the integration over r in (4.5). roughly speaking, in polar coordinates the
hankel-transforms play the same role, as the ordinary fourier-transforms in the
cartesian one.

let us briey recall the main formulae concerning to the hankel-transforms
(for details see [13] and references therein). the -th order (  > 1 ) direct and

12

inverse hankel-transforms of the function f (x) dened on (0,) are given by

z0
j (sx)ff (s) sds,
z0

j (sx) f (x) xdx,

(a.1)

(a.2)

f (x) =

ff (s) =

where j is the bessel function. in complete analogy with the case of fourier-
transform, it follows from (a.1), (a.2), that the scalar product of any two
functions f (x), g(x) coincides with that of their images 2

z0

f (x) g (x) xdx =

z0 ff (s)fg (s) sds.

(a.3)

to use (a.3) for the calculation of the integral in eq.(4.5) we need to know
hankel images of the functions i(x)k(x) and i+1(x)k(x) which can be easily
obtained from the general formula [13]

k (x) i (x) =

re ( + ) <

j+ (2x sinh t) e(+)tdt,

(a.7)

though the direct application of eq. (a.3) to each term of (4.5) at rst sight
seems to be problematic due to the logarithmic divergence of the integral over at
large r, but nevertheless it leads to a correct result, because of mutual cancellation
of these divergences by various terms.

2since the functions we are dealing with are regular in the interval (0,), the only thing

one has to care of is the convergence of integrals at the extreme points 0 and .
