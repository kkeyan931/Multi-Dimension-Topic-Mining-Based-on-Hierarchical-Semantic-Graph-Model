a correspondence between the three-block truncated 11d supergravity and the 8d pure
einstein gravity with two commuting killing symmetries is discussed. the kaluza-klein
two-forms of the 6d theory obtained after dimensional reduction along the killing orbits
generate the four-form eld of supergravity via an inverse dualization. thus any solution
to the vacuum einstein equations in eight dimensions depending on six coordinates have
11d-supergravity counterparts with the non-trivial four-form eld. using this proposed
duality we derive a new dyon solution of 11d supergravity describing the m 2 and m 5
branes intersecting at a point.

1 introduction

recently the embedding of the classical solutions of lower dimensional (truncated)
gauged supergravities into the type iib string and mtheory has attracted much
attention as providing a simple way to nd solutions of the latter theories in terms of
lower dimensional models. this type of embedding is based on the sn (transversal
space of desired solution) compactications as well as a consistent truncation of
scalar elds and vector multiplets. for examples, the charged ads5, ads4 and
ads7 black holes had been embedded as the d3branes, m 2branes and m 5
branes respectively. it is worth noting that the charges of the ads black holes may
be interpreted as the angular momenta of the associated branes 1.

here we suggest another way of embedding 2 of lower-dimensional gravity so-
lutions into eleven-dimensional supergravity using a non-local duality between so-
lutions in the vacuum einstein theory in eight dimensions and 11d supergravity.
this symmetry is based on the fact that the six-dimensional reduction of the eight-
dimensional vacuum einstein theory in presence of two spacelike commuting killing
vectors admits, after suitable eld redenitions, the same form as the truncated
boson sector of d = 11 supergravity compactied on t 5 with some additional re-
strictions on the metric and the threeform eld. this correspondence provides a
new scheme of uplifting the d  8 dimensional solutions to vacuum einstein grav-
ity, especially the non-linear superpositions of known kaluzaklein solutions such
as pp-waves, kk-monopole, melvin universes etc., to their supergravity counter-
parts, producing, for instance, intersecting m uxbranes 3 as well as a new type
composite m 2  m 5brane 2 corresponding to the kaluzaklein dyon black hole.
the proposed new mapping from 8d to 11d is one to many, depending on the
choice of two killing vectors in eight dimensions. this opens a way to proliferate

1

11d solutions taking as a seed an already known one, lowering it down to eight
dimensions according to the parameterization suggested, and then coming back to
eleven dimensions with a dierent choice of (ordered) killing vectors. this generates
the whole class of supergravity solutions related non-locally to each other.

2 11d supergravity vs. 8d einstein gravity

the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity contains the eleven-dimensional metric gab
and a three-form gauge eld a[3] described by a lagrangian which possesses a non-
vanishing chern-simons term 4

(1)

where f[4] = d a[3]. assuming the spacetimes can be decomposed into threeblock
as m 11 = m 2(za)  m 3(yi)  m 1,5(x), where m 2 and m 3 are conformally at
euclidean spaces, m 1,5 is the pseudoriemannian six-dimensional spacetime and,
equivalently, the metric has the following form

(2)

here the scalars g2, g3 and the six-dimensional metric g are functions of x.
the corresponding consistent truncation of 11d supergravity involves the following
ansatz for the 11d fourform eld f[4]:

f[4]ab = abf[2] ,
f[4] = h[4] ,

f[4]ijk = ijk,

(3)

where h[4] = db[3], f[2] = da1] and  are the sixdimensional fourform, twoforms
and pseudoscalar respectively.

it is straightforward to show that the equations of motion for the sixdimensional

variables can be derived from the following action

now let us start with the 8d einstein theory of gravity

after that the eective actions (4) and (9) are identical. therefore, any 8d vacuum
solution with at least two spacelike killing vectors can be embedded into 11d
supergravity by the following procedure:

1. writing an 8d ricci at space with two commuting killing vectors to the

form of (7) and making the identications of variables by (8).

2. obtaining the fourform h[4] via the dualization (10).

3. recovering the 11d metric as (2) through inverse variable identication (5).
4. deriving the 11d fourform eld f[4] by (3).
possible permutation of two killing vectors in (7) will lead to dierent 11d
solutions. moreover, if the actual number of commuting spacelike isometries of the
8d solution is greater than two, one can generate several dierent 11d solutions
via dierent choice of the ordered pair of  adirections in (7).

3 m 2 and m 5brane solutions

the simplest examples of application of the new embedding procedure are the non
rotating black m 2brane and m 5brane. consider the 8d pp-wave metric

in a similar way one can obtain rotating branes, solutions endowed with waves and
kk monopoles as well as some their intersections.

the above construction illustrates that our mapping from 8d to 11d is one
to many, i.e. an unique 8d vacuum solution can have several 11d supergravity
counterparts depending on the choice and the order of two killing vectors in eight
dimensions. this provides a simple way to proliferate 11d solutions: taking one
known solution one can nd its 8d vacuum partner and then go back to eleven
dimensions with a dierent choice of the killing vectors involved. for example,
two well-known vedimensional kk solutions, the brinkmann wave and the kk-
monopole, can be combined in a sixdimensional vacuum solution which has six 11d
counterparts including all pairwise intersections of four basic solutions: m 2brane,
m 5brane, wave and monopole except the m 2m 5brane. one can also nd the
nutgeneralizations of the rotating m -branes in a way similar to that used in the
ve-dimensional theory 5.

4 m 2  m 5brane solution
a new interesting solution representing a non-standard intersection of the m 2 and
m 5 branes at a point (not over a string as demanded by the usual intersection
rules) can be obtained starting with the 5d kaluzaklein dyon. the most general
dyonic black hole solution of kk theory was found by gibbons and wiltshire 6 and
its rotating version by clement 7, rasheed 8 and larsen 9. in the static case this
is a threeparameter family (with mass, electric and magnetic charges m, q, p):

this solution for p = 0 reduces to the usual m 2brane while for q = 0  to the
m 5brane (localized only on a part of the full transverse space). however, for both
q, p non-zero, this is a new dyonic brane: contrary to the m 2  m 5brane 10,11,12,
for which the electric brane lies totally within the magnetic one, and contrary to
the intersecting m 2m 5brane (with a common string), now the common part of
the world-volumes is zero-dimensional (we suggest the name m 2  m 5).

5 conclusion

we have presented a new generating technique to obtain solutions to 11d supergrav-
ity with non-zero four-form eld starting with the solutions of vacuum 8d gravity
with two commuting killing spacelike killing symmetries. this method can also be
combined with other tools to get physically interesting solutions. in particular, a
direct application of our procedure does not allow to obtain 11d branes localized on
all coordinates of transverse space, since our basic ansatz (2) is not general enough.
however one still can use it to explore possible geometric 11d structures and then
to try to localize solutions in a straightforward way. thus we have given a purely
vacuum interpretation to a certain class of the 11d supergravity m -branes via new
non-local duality between 11d supergravity and 8d vacuum einstein gravity. it
is worth noting that the very natural correspondence between the killing spinor
equations in both theories may have a deeper meaning in the context of 8d su-
pergravities 2. in this connection it has to be emphasized that the type of duality
described here is by no means related to the direct dimensional reduction from 11d
to 8d theory. it is also dierent from the duality between the 8d self-dual gauge
theories and 10d/11d supergravities discussed in 10,11 where the four-form has a
non-geometric origin.
