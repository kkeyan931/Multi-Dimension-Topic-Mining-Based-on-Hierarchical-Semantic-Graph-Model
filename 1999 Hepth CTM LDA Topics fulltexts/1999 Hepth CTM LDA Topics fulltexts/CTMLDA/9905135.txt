(19). straightfor- ward without going details, let us simply note results, namely, that, case, obtain +,n = (2n + 1) ,n = 2(n + 1) +,n(x) = b+,n e 1 ,n(x) = b,n e 1 2 x2 2 x2 h2n+1( x) h2n+1( x) (20) n = 0, 1, 2,. several things note analysis. first, odd hermite polynomials survive physical solutions since wave function vanish origin. boundary condition arises systematic study involving regularized potential. second, energy levels supersymmetric pair hamiltonians longer degenerate. furthermore, state = 0 longer belongs hilbert space (since corresponds even hermite polynomial solution). leads conventional conclusion supersymmetry broken case let us note, particular, case, would appear superpartner states belong physical hilbert space (namely, case, supercharge odd 6 operator hence connects even odd hermite polynomials. however, boundary condition selects odd hermite polynomials belonging physical hilbert space.). absolutely doubt supersymmetry broken case. question needs addressed whether dynamical property system artifact regularization (and, hence boundary condition) used. answer quite obvious, namely, supersymmetry broken mainly regularization (and, therefore, boundary condition) breaks supersymmetry. words, value regularizing parameters, c (even |c+| = |c|), pair potentials eq. (19) dene supersymmetric system hence regularization breaks supersymmetry. consequently, breaking supersymmetry results regularization removed cannot trusted dynamical eect. regularized superpotential another way understand note supersymmetric system, potential fundamental. rather, superpotential gives pair supersymmetric poten- tials riccati type relations. natural, therefore, regularize superpotential would automatically lead pair regularized potentials would supersymmetric value regularization parameter. namely, regularization respect supersymmetry and, regularization, is, then, meaningful ask supersymmetry broken regularization parameter removed end. mind, let us look regularized superpotential (21) c regularization parameter supposed take |c| end. note although, level, signs regularization parameter allowed, existence normalizable ground state (see eq. (6)) selects c > 0 (otherwise, regularization would broken supersymmetry instanton eects mentioned earlier). w (x) = x(x) + c(x) regularized superpotential leads pair regularized supersymmetric potentials v+(x) = v(x) = 1 1 2h(2x2 )(x) + c2(x) c(x)i 2h(2x2 + )(x) + c2(x) + c(x)i (22) supersymmetric c > 0. let us note dierence earlier case potentials directly regularized (see eq. (19)) lies presence (x) terms potentials. consequently, earlier solutions regions x > 0 x < 0 continue hold. however, matching conditions dierent delta function terms. carefully matching wave function discontinuity rst derivative across x = 0 wavefunctions taking ratio, obtain two conditions 1 (c2 2+)1/2 c = 1 2 ( + 2 ) ( + 2 + 1 2 ) 7 (23) 1 (c2 2)1/2 + c = 1 2 ( ( 2 + 1 2 ) 2 + 1) clear that, c , (23) (24) give respectively +,n = 2n ,n = 2(n + 1) n = 0, 1, 2, corresponding wave functions, case, forms +,n(x) = b+,n e 1 ,n(x) = b,n e 1 2 x2 2 x2 h2n( x) h2n+1( x) (24) (25) (26) indeed quite interesting shows spectrum h+ contains ground state vanishing energy. furthermore, states h+ h degenerate energy corresponding even odd hermite polynomials one would expect superpartner states. consequently, quite clear supersymmetric half oscillator dened carefully regularizing superpotential, then, supersymmetry manifest limit removing regularization. contrasted general belief supersymmetry broken system (which consequence using boundary conditions or, equivalently, regularizing potentials manner violates supersymmetry). alternate regularization course, worry point regularization independent conclusion really is. namely, results appear follow matching conditions presence singular delta potential terms and, consequently, worth investigating whether conclusions would continue hold alternate regularization superpotential would introduce singular terms potentials. mind, let us choose regularized superpotential form (27) regularization parameter take limit || end. again, note that, although signs appear allowed, existence normalizable ground state (see eq. (6)) would select > 0. w (x) = x(x) x(x) regularized superpotential would lead pair supersymmetric potentials form v+(x) = v(x) = 1 2h(2x2 )(x) + (2x2 )(x)i 2h(2x2 + )(x) + (2x2 + )(x)i 1 8 (28) singular delta potential terms regularization. fact, regularization merely introduces supersymmetric pair oscillators x < 0 whose frequency taken innity end. since harmonic oscillator potential x > 0 x < 0, solutions straightforward. parabolic cylinder functions mentioned earlier. matching wave function rst derivative x = 0 hamiltonians taking ratio, obtain 1 1 ( + 2 ) ( + 2 + 1 2 ) ( 2 + 1 2 ) ( 2 + 1) = = 1 1 ( + 2 ) ( + 2 + 1 2 ) ( 2 + 1 2 ) ( + 2 + 1) clear that, , eqs. (29) (30) give respectively +,n = 2n ,n = 2(n + 1) n = 0, 1, 2, corresponding wave functions given +,n(x) = b+,n e 1 ,n(x) = b,n e 1 2 x2 2 x2 h2n( x) h2n+1( x) (29) (30) (31) (32) are, course, energy levels wave functions obtained eqs. (25) (26) respectively showing supersymmetry manifest. furthermore, shows conclusion independent regularization used long regularization preserves supersymmetry achieved properly regularizing superpotential. 3 oscillator 1 x2 potential last section, showed that, presence one kind singularity, namely, boundary, supersymmetry unbroken. follows, study another class supersymmetric models, namely, supersymmetric oscillator 1 x2 potential, genuine singularity potential necessarily arising boundary. naive analysis model  also shows supersymmetry broken singular potential (for certain parameter ranges). however, conclusion understood, again, consequence regularizing potential which, seen before, respect supersymmetry. stead, show careful analysis that, superpotential regularized, supersymmetry manifest model well (with lot interesting features). section, however, systematically 9 analyze quantum mechanical system corresponding oscillator presence 1 x2 potential (postponing discussion supersymmetric case next section). system analyzed several people  complete analysis appears ref. . however, feel that, energy levels derived  correct, wave functions (namely, extensions solutions positive negative axis incomplete wave functions, course, become quite crucial one wants extend analysis supersymmetric system) and, consequently, present careful analysis system regularizing singular potential systematic manner. supersymmetric system mind (to follow next section), write potential system (with h = = = 1) v (x) = 1 2(cid:20) g(g + 1) x2 + x2 2g + 1(cid:21) consequently, schrodinger equation want study form " d2 dx2 g(g + 1) x2 x2 + (2 + 2g 1)# (x) = 0 (33) (34) singular potential repulsive g > 0 g < 1 attractive 1 < g < 0. furthermore, ease comparison, let us make identications notations ref.  (note energies shifted since mind supersymmetric system study later) 1 2 = (2 e = + g ) = g(g + 1) 2 1 4 1 2 also worth noting schrodinger equation (34) invariant g (g + 1) + 2g + 1 (35) (36) symmetry, course, would also reected solutions. furthermore, xed point symmetry, namely, g = 1 2 separates two branches (namely, every value exist two distinct values g corresponding two distinct branches separated branch point) parameter space. regularized potential schrodinger equation (34) solved quite easily x > 0 also done . however, determine correctly wavefunction extended negative axis, suitable regularize potential near origin study problem carefully. let us 10 consider potential form v (x) = 1 1 2h g(g+1) 2h g(g+1) x2 + x2 2g + 1i r2 + r2 2g + 1i |x| > r |x| < r (37) namely, regularized potential continuous manner preserving symmetry eq. (36) understanding regularization parameter r 0 end. regularization, schrodinger equation analyzed three distinct regions. however, since potential reection symmetry, need analyze solutions regions r < x < r x > r. potential constant region r < x < r hence schrodinger equation quite simple here. solutions classied even odd ones take forms (ii)even(x) = a(r) cosh x (ii)odd(x) = b(r) sinh x dened =s g(g + 1) r2 + r2 (2 + 2g 1) pg(g + 1) r (38) (39) since r small (and take vanishing limit end), last equality holds g 6= 0 1 assume. special values g corresponding absence singular potential treated separately come back end section. note normalization constants, b, can, principle depend regularization parameter allowed writing form solutions eq.

(42). however, easily checked two solutions corresponding two values really proportional independent. thus, write general solution schrodinger equation, x > 0, (i)(x) = c(r) e 1 (46) 2 x2 " (g 1 2 ) 2 g 2 ) ( 1 xg+1 (1 2 , g + 3 2 , x2) + (g + 1 2 ) (1 2 ) xg ( 1 2 g 2 ,g + 1 2 , x2)# again, allowed dependence normalization constant, c, regulariza- tion parameter, r. however, nontrivial solution exist, require c(r) r0 c 6= 0 far, general solutions, two regions, energy quantized arise matching conditions. furthermore, bothered evaluate solution region x < r clearly would region x > r. however, matching conditions would determine extend solutions region x > r region x < r. therefore, let us examine matching conditions systematically since two possible cases. (i) even solution match even solution region r < x < r derivative region x > r x = r. taking ratio remembering r small (which taken zero end), obtain leading order r qg(g + 1) tanhqg(g + 1) = (g + 1) (g 1 2 ) 2 g ( 1 2 ) rg+1 g (g+ 1 2 ) 2 ) rg (1 (g 1 2 ) 2 g ( 1 2 ) rg+1 + (g+ 1 2 ) 2 ) rg (1 (47) 12 since left hand side independent r, consistency, right hand side must also happen two dierent ways. first, g > 1 n = 0, 1, 2,.) 2 , clear relation (47) satised (we assume 1 = n + f1(g)r2g+1 2 n = 2(n + 1) 2f1(g)r2g+1 or, suitable choice f1(g). hand, g < 1 1 2 g or, 2 , 2 n = (2n 2g + 1) 2f2(g)r2g1 = n + f2(g)r2g1 (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) relation (47) satised suitable choice f2(g). branches solution simply reect symmetry eq.

(iii) similarly, could chosen would lead pair supersymmetric potentials w (x) = g + 1 x x v+(x) = + x2 + 2g + 3(cid:21) normalizable ground state would exist g < 1 2 . v(x) = 1 + x2 + 2g + 1(cid:21) 1 2(cid:20) (g + 1)(g + 2) 2(cid:20) g(g + 1) x2 x2 (91) (92) (93) (94) sense, generalization idea spin 1 2 particle, say example, belong distinct multiplets form (0, 1 2 , 1). (as clear now, transformation g (g + 1) g (g 1) alluded earlier would simply take one supersymmetric system another cannot symmetry one supersymmetric system.) 2 ) ( 1 (iv) however, also possibility choosing w (x) = g x x 21 (95) giving supersymmetric potentials v+(x) = v(x) = 1 x2 2(cid:20) g(g + 1) 2(cid:20) g(g 1) x2 1 + x2 + 2g 1(cid:21) + x2 + 2g + 1(cid:21) (96) namely, h+ h could also reversed roles (this basically determines potential contains ground state). case, normalizable ground state would exist g < 1 2 . meaning solutions clear now. first, solutions corresponding branch g > 1 2 dene supersymmetric solutions corresponding supersymmetrization eq. (89). solutions corresponding branch g < 1 2 also dene supersymmetric set solutions corresponding supersymmetrization eq. (95). (it clear solutions related eq. (88).) fact spectrum contains zero energy state, would expect supersymmetric system, follows fact potentials (96) shifted respect (90). finally, solutions even share branch correspond supersymmetrizations eqs. (91) (93). supersymmetry manifest spite singular behavior potentials. also clear analysis distinct solutions really correspond distinct supersymmetrizations deriving conclusions regarding supersymmetry, one careful identifying correct solutions among whole set. 5 algebraic solution supersymmetric system studied previous section special system also solved algebraically. therefore, understand properties system, present short derivation algebraic solution system. let us consider supersymmetric system potentials eq. (64). dening supercharges (3), namely, q(g) = q(g) = dx 1 2(cid:18) 2(cid:18) 1 dx + + g x x(cid:19) x x(cid:19) g write supersymmetric pair hamiltonians also h+(g) = q(g)q(g) h(g) = q(g)q(g) 22 (97) (98) however, structure potentials eq. (64), clear write h(g) = q(g)q(g) = q(g + 1)q(g + 1) + 2 = h+(g + 1) + 2 (99) hamiltonian, h+(g), (equivalently, potential) known shape invariant . ground state h+(g) satises 1 2(cid:18) q(g)+,0(g, x) = or, +,0(g, x) xg e 1 dx 2 x2 + g x x(cid:19) +,0(x) = 0 solution normalizable physical g > 1 2 furthermore, ground state energy h+(g), case, zero, +,0 = 0 (100) (101) (102) since h+(g) h(g) supersymmetric partners share energy levels except ground state h+(g), clear ground state energy h(g) would correspond rst excited state energy h+(g) relations eqs. (99) (102), follows, therefore, energy rst excited state h+(g) +,1 = 2 (103) let us note ground state wavefunction h(g) (from structure eq. (99)) would follow form +,0(g + 1, x) xg+1 e 1 2 x2 (104) would normalizable g > 3 2 would automatically hold eq. (101) true. can, fact, construct sequence hamiltonians, case, form h (0) = h+(g) = q(g)q(g) h (1) = h(g) = q(g)q(g) = q(g + 1)q(g + 1) + 2 h (2) = q(g + 1)q(g + 1) + 2 = q(g + 2)q(g + 2) + 4 ... h (s) = q(g + s)q(g + s) + 2s (105) structure hamiltonians, clear ground state hamiltonian sequence would normalizable eq. (101) holds. furthermore, every adjacent pair hamiltonians, h (s) h (s1) would dene supersymmetric pair hamiltonians share 23 energy levels except ground state h (s1) would energy eigenvalue 2(s 1). energy levels original pair hamiltonians, h+(g) h(g) follow (106) ,n = 2(n + 1) +,n = 2n, course, energy levels obtained earlier analysis (see eqs. (71) (83)). wave functions original hamiltonians also obtained analysis spectrum sequence hamiltonians. easily seen  iterated give +,n(g, x) q(g)+,n1(g + 1, x) +,n(g, x) q(g)q(g + 1) q(g + n 1)+,0(g + n, x) (107) (108) since, know ground state wave function, +,0 (see eq. (100)), wave functions higher states explicitly constructed. furthermore, know +,n(g, x), superpartner states also obtained relation (see (5) discussion following) ,n(g, x) q(g)+,n(g, x) (109) worth asking algebraically constructed states also coincide states constructed eqs. (72) (82) respectively. easy verify relation (cid:18) dx + g x x(cid:19) e 1 2 x2 xg+1 (n + 1, g + 3 2 , x2) = (2g + 1) e 1 2 x2 xg (n, g + , x2) 1 2 (110) appropriate recursion relation eq. (107) system. furthermore, noting form ground state wave function eq. (100) e 1 2 x2 xg = e 1 2 x2 xg (0, g + , x2) 1 2 (111) choosing even function ground state, normally do, (as far see, algebraic method cannot determine priori whether function even/odd), clear states associated h+(g) would even states would coincide eq. (72). identied, superpartner states also follow coincide eq. (82) odd. concludes algebraic construction supersymmetric spectrum system shows supersymmetry manifest. 6 puzzle interesting puzzle raised literature  connection supersymmetric system eq. (64) section, describe resolution puzzle systematic 24 analysis problem. namely, let us look pair supersymmetric potentials eq.

(113). is, course, clear explicit spectrum system constructed part supersymmetric system. must, therefore, belong dierent supersymmetric system since seen earlier, distinct supersymmetrizations lead distinct forms wave functions. fact, let us choose g 1 x x (115) fw (x) = 25 would lead pair supersymmetric potentials forms + x2 + 2g 3(cid:21) 1 x2 2(cid:20) g(g 1) 2(cid:20) (g 1)(g 2) x2 1 + x2 + 2g 1(cid:21) ev+(x) = ev(x) = (116) (117) (118) clear supersymmetric system would normalizable, even ground state form normalizable g < 3 2 . also clear wave function coincides (113) g = 1 (which range validity). (113) belong supersymmetric spectrum (64), rather, legitimate ground state supersymmetrization eq.
