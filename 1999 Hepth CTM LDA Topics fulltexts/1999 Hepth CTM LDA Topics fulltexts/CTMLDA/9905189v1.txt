abstract. we study quantum caustics (i.e., the quantum analogue of the classi-
cal singularity in the dirichlet boundary problem) in d-dimensional systems with
2 rij(t) xixj +
quadratic lagrangians of the form l = 1
si(t) xi. based on schulmans procedure in the path-integral we derive the tran-
sition amplitude on caustics in a closed form for generic multiplicity f , and
thereby complete the previous analysis carried out for the maximal multiplicity
case (f = d). the unitarity relation, together with the initial condition, fullled
by the amplitude is found to be a key ingredient for determining the amplitude,
which reduces to the well-known expression with van-vleck determinant for the
non-caustics case (f = 0). multiplicity dependence of the caustics phenomena
is illustrated by examples of a particle interacting with external electromagnetic
elds.

1. introduction

the semiclassical approximation of quantum mechanics [1] is a powerful means to

investigate various  often non-perturbative  aspects of quantization in reference to

classical mechanics.

in the path-integral framework, it amounts to keeping only up to

quadratic terms in the lagrangian, and as such the core of the semiclassical approximation

resides in the evaluation of the integral for quadratic systems. the path-integral then

becomes gaussian allowing for a closed form for the transition amplitude in terms of the

familiar van vleck determinant. that is, in d-dimensions, the amplitude for the transition
between aa, bb  ri d during the time interval [0, t ] reads

k(bb, t ; aa, 0) =sdet(cid:18) i

2h

2i[xx]

aibj(cid:19) e

i

h i[xx] .

(1.1)

here i[xx] = r t

0 dt l is the action for the quadratic part of the lagrangian along the
classical path xx(t) which satises the dirichlet boundary conditions corresponding to the

transition. the point to be noted is that the transition kernel k(bb, t ; aa, 0) in (1.1) develops

singularities if there exists no (or more than one) classical paths which meet the dirichlet

boundary conditions, and accordingly there arise physical phenomena characteristic to the

singularities known as caustics in geometrical optics [2].

historically, the semiclassical analysis of caustics phenomena was conducted inten-

sively in late seventies in association with the catastrophe theory (see, e.g., [3, 4] and

references therein). there, one takes into account cubic terms to avoid the singularities

(and hence the caustics no longer exist in the strict sense), which is in fact an appropri-

ate procedure for most realistic physical systems. the path-integral is then approximated

by the generalized airy integral governed by catastrophe polynomials [5, 6, 7]. on the

other hand, for endpoints beyond caustics, namely when the endpoints go beyond singular

(conjugate) points, the analysis for pure quadratic systems was carried out in evaluat-

ing the correction in phase factor [8] as well as in providing a more general basis for the

semiclassical expansion in the path-integral [9]. the latter considered also endpoints on

caustics, but only for the extreme case when the caustics occur maximally, that is, when

the multiplicity f of the caustics coincides with the dimension d. specic examples on

caustics have been studied independently in [10, 11] (see also [12, 13]).

2

the aim of this paper is to present a complete analysis of quantum caustics for

quadratic systems by deriving the transition amplitude in a closed form under generic

multiplicity f on caustics in d-dimensions, extending that of [9] and of our own [14]. we

shall nd that, in both classical and quantum regimes, caustics have a rich structure char-

acterized by the multiplicity, and this will be demonstrated by two examples furnished

later. schulmans procedure [5, 4] will be adopted for evaluating the kernel on caustics,

but the key ingredient to get the closed form turns out to be the unitarity relation and

the initial condition satised by the kernel. this we nd is amusing, as the set of these

requirements alone is sucient to get the kernel formula (1.1) for regular (non-caustics)

cases without recourse to any involved measures.

this paper is organized as follows. after the introduction, in section 2 we provide

a general argument for caustics both in classical and quantum mechanics. using the

unitarity relation as a key ingredient, the transition amplitude is derived explicitly for the

generic case of multiplicity. for illustration, in section 3 we consider a particle moving

under external electric and magnetic elds exhibiting caustics phenomena with dierent

multiplicities. section 4 is devoted to our conclusion.

2. caustics in classical and quantum mechanics

in this section we present a general theory of caustics for quadratic systems in d-

dimensions in both classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. we rst provide a

framework for classical caustics which are classied by the multiplicity f given by the

co-dimension of the surface formed by the set of focal points. we then derive the transi-

tion kernel for generic f based on the unitarity relation and the initial condition satised

by the kernel. the result reduces to the standard formula (1.1) for the nonsingular (f = 0)

case and to the one previously obtained for the maximally singular (f = d) case.

2.1. classical caustics

the systems we are interested in are those described by lagrangians in d-dimensions

which are at most quadratic:

l =

1
2

pij(t) xi xj + qij(t) xi xj +

1
2

rij(t) xixj + si(t) xi .

(2.1)

the coecient functions pij(t), qij(t), rij(t), si(t) with i, j = 1, 2, . . . , d are smooth

functions of time t, and it is understood that repeated indices are summed over unless
otherwise stated. we take pij(t) and rij(t) symmetric as a matrix, p t (t) = p (t), rt (t) =
r(t), and assume that p (t) is positive-denite, i.e., all of its minors are positive for any
t  [0, t ]. the equations of motion derived from the action read

 xx + ss = 00 ,

where we have used the matrix-valued operator,

 := 

d

dt(cid:18)p (t)

d
dt

+ qt (t)(cid:19) +(cid:18)q(t)

d
dt

+ r(t)(cid:19) .

(2.2)

(2.3)

we note that the operator  is self-adjoint in the space of functions which vanish at the

time boundary t = 0 and t .

we shall consider the dirichlet problem associated with the equation (2.2), that is,

we look for the solution xx(t) of (2.2) satisfying the boundary conditions,

xx(0) = aa,

xx(t ) = bb,

(2.4)

4

to some given vectors aa, bb  ri d. the usual procedure for this is to choose rst two
independent sets of solutions, {vvk(t)} and {uuk(t)} for k = 1, 2, . . . , d, which obey the
homogeneous (jacobi) equation,

 vvk = 00,

 uuk = 00,

k = 1, 2, . . . , d .

(2.5)

the set {vvk} is specied by requiring that

vi
k(0) = ik,

vi
k(0) = 0,

i, k = 1, 2, . . . , d .

on the other hand, for {uk} we impose only the conditions,

ui
k(0) = 0,

i, k = 1, 2, . . . , d ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

for the moment and leave ui
k(0) undetermined. these solutions form a complete set of
solutions for the homogeneous equation.2 later, we shall impose other conditions to specify

the set uniquely.

we also choose a special solution ss(t) of the full equations of motion (2.2),  ss +ss = 0,
obeying the initial condition si(0) = 0. (for our present purpose we do not need to specify
the initial velocities sj(0).) then, in terms of 2d constants, ak, bk for k = 1, 2, . . . , d, the

general solution of the equations of motion (2.2) is given by

xx(t) = ak uuk(t) + bk vvk(t) + ss(t) .

(2.8)

for convenience, we introduce the matrices u (t) and v (t) from the solutions by uik(t) :=
k(t) and vik(t) := vi
ui

k(t), respectively, and thereby rewrite the general solution (2.8) as

xx(t) = u (t) aa + v (t) bb + ss(t) ,

(2.9)

with aa = (a1, . . . , ad)t and bb = (b1, . . . , bd)t . then the initial condition in (2.4) implies
bb = aa whereas the nal condition in (2.4) is met by choosing

aa = u 1(t ) (bb  v (t ) aa  ss(t )) .

(2.10)

it is thus clear that the solution to the dirichlet problem (2.4) does not exist if det u (t ) =

0, and this is the cause of caustics.

2 note that our boundary conditions, (2.6) and (2.7), dier slightly from those used in ref.[9].

5

to formulate the caustics more precisely, let us dene f such that d  f becomes the

rank of the matrix u (t ), and choose the (new) set of solutions {uuk} satisfying

uuk(t ) = 00

for k = 1, 2, . . . , f.

(2.11)

we also demand, for simplicity, that the non-vanishing part of the solutions in the set be

normalized as

ui
k(t ) = ik

for

i, k = f + 1, f + 2, . . . , d .

(2.12)

hence, at t = t the matrix u (t ) takes the form,

u (t ) =(cid:18) 0 0 1(cid:19) .

(2.13)

here the upper left 0 is a f  f null matrix, the lower left 0 is a (d f ) f null matrix,
1 is a (d f ) (d f ) identity matrix, and  represents a f  (d f ) matrix consisting
of undetermined elements. as we shall see shortly, the number f gives the co-dimension of

the surface where caustics occur, with f = d and f = 0 being the two extremes. we call

these extreme cases full caustics and non-caustics, respectively, and use partial caustics

for other intermediate cases.

note that the choice, (2.11) and (2.12), can always be realized by linear transforma-
tions in the solution space formed by {uuk} after some exchanges of the coordinates, if
necessary. it then follows from the solution (2.8) that the surface of caustics (i.e., the set

of all endpoints) conjugate to the initial point a is given by

xx = uuk(t )ak + hh(aa) ,

(2.14)

where ak, k = f + 1, . . . , d, parameterize the (d  f )-dimensional caustic surface, and we
have used

hh(aa) := vvk(t )ak + ss(t ) .

(2.15)

thus, if f 6= 0, then for our dirichlet problem the best we can do (in our coordinate
frame) is to nd a solution that meets the conditions xi(t ) = bi for i = f + 1, . . . , d by

choosing

ak = ak(bb) := bk  hk(aa)

for k = f + 1, f + 2, . . . , d.

endpoint vector xx(t ) by the projection operator. the vectors u (t )hh(aa) and
bb  xx(t ) become orthogonal to u (t )bb when u (t ) is symmetric.

to specify the solution uniquely, for the remaining components k = 1, . . . , f we set ak = 0

for simplicity. with this choice the classical solution turns out to be

reduces to bi for i = f + 1, f + 2, . . . , d as required.

an important point to note is that the matrix u (t ), normalized as (2.13), fullls
(u (t ))2 = u (t ) and hence it acts as a projection operator onto the caustic surface given
by (2.14). accordingly, the matrix u (t ) := 1  u (t ) projects vectors down to the
complenetary space orthogonal to the surface. (strictly speaking, the space is not quite

orthogonal to the surface because u (t ) may not be symmetric.) in terms of these projec-

tion operators the endpoint of our classical solution (2.18) is

xx(t ) = u (t ) bb + u (t ) hh(aa),

(2.19)

where now its geometrical meaning is evident (fig.1).

7

we here derive some useful identities which will be important later. notice rst that,

for arbitrary vector-valued functions ff and gg, we have

z t

0

dt (ff   gg  gg   ff ) =h(cid:16) ff  p gg  gg  p ff(cid:17) + ff (cid:0)q  qt(cid:1) ggit

0

,

(2.20)

where we have used the inner product aa  bb = aibi.
solutions ff = uuk, gg = vvl of the jacobi equation (2.5), then from the boundary conditions,

if we choose for the functions the

(2.6), (2.7), (2.11) and (2.12), we nd that in matrix form the relations (2.20) become

v t (t )p (t ) u(t ) v t (t )p (t )u (t ) +v t (t )(cid:8)qt (t )q(t )(cid:9)u (t ) = p (0) u(0) . (2.21)

we may also choose ff = uuk and gg = uul to get

u t (t )p (t ) u(t )  u t (t )p (t )u (t ) + u t (t )(cid:8)qt (t )  q(t )(cid:9)u (t ) = 0 .
in particular, for l > f and k  f the (lk)-component of the identities (2.22) reads

(2.22)

uul(t )  p (t ) uuk(t ) = 0 .

(2.23)

in the non-caustics case where one has u (t ) = 1, one can eliminate q(t ) from the identity

(2.21) by using (2.22) to nd

n v t (t ) + v t (t ) u t (t )o p (t ) = p (0) u(0) .

(2.24)

let us recall the general denition of the jacobi elds. denote by xx(pp, t) the classical

solution with

xx(pp, 0) = aa,

= pp ,

(2.25)

l[xx]

 xx (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

for some given aa, pp  ri d. then the jacobi elds are given by

jik(t) :=

 xi(p, t)

pk

.

(2.26)

for our quadratic system (2.1) we have the classical solution in the form (2.8) and pk is
given by pki(0) xi(0) + ai qik(0). from these the jacobi elds are found to be

j(t) = u (t) u 1(0)p 1(0) .

(2.27)

8

this shows manifestly that j(t) fullls the jacobi equation (2.5) with the initial condition

j(0) = 0.

at this point we remark that, as can be seen from the explicit form of the classical

solution (2.8) the classical action for the solution is at most quadratic in the boundary

values,

i[xx] = wijaiaj + xijaibj + yijbibj + eiai + fibi + g,

(2.28)

where wij, xij, . . . , g are some functions of t . (note that in (2.28) the summation for ai
over i runs from 1 to d whereas for bi it runs only from f + 1 to d due to the choice in

(2.16).) for instance, in terms of our jacobi elds, xij, i = 1, . . . , d, j = f + 1, . . . , d, are

given by

xij =

j (t )(cid:21).

(2.29)

in particular, for non-caustics case the identity (2.24) can be used to simplify (2.29) into

x = 

1

2np (0) u(0) +h v t (t ) + v t (t ) u t (t )i p (t )o = p (0) u (0) .

using (2.30) and (2.27), one can immediately conrm the relation,

j(t ) x = x j(t ) = 1,

which follows from the general denition (2.25).

(2.30)

(2.31)

2.2. quantum caustics

we now move on to quantum mechanics and consider the problem corresponding to the

classical dirichlet problem (2.4), that is, we wish to nd the transition kernel k(bb, t ; aa, 0)

whose path-integral expression is

k(bb, t ; aa, 0) =z xx(t )=bb

xx(0)=aa dxx e

i

h i[xx] .

9

(2.32)

to this end, as we did for the one-dimensional case, we rst decompose any path xx(t) with

the boundary values (2.4) as

xx(t) = xx(t) + (t) + (t) .

(2.33)

here xx(t) is a classical path starting from xx(0) = aa and ending at a point in the caustic

surface (2.14), and for deniteness we choose to be the one (2.17) mentioned earlier. the

function (t) is a compensating function satisfying (0) = 00 and

(t ) = bb  xx(t ) = u (t )(bb  hh(aa)) ,

(2.34)

which is designed to ll the gap between the given endpoint bb for the transition and the
actual endpoint xx(t ) of the classical solution. note that u (t )(t ) = 0 implies i(t ) = 0

for i = f + 1, . . . , d.

the nal piece (t) in (2.33) representing uctuations fullls (0) = (t ) = 0 and

may be expanded as (t) = pn ann(t) in terms of the orthonormal vector-valued eigen-
functions {n} associated with the self-adjoint operator :

(t) n(t) = n n(t) ,

with

n(0) = n(t ) = 0 ;

z t

0

dt n(t)  m(t) = nm.

the action for an arbitrary path xx(t) then becomes

i[xx] = i[xx +  + ]

notice that, when caustics occur, the solutions {uuk} for k = 1, 2, . . . , f may be chosen
such that they are orthonormal each other, r t
0 dt uuk(t)  uul(t) = kl, by performing linear
transformations among themselves. this implies that {uuk} is just the set of f zero modes
{k} with k = 0 in the orthonormal set of eigenfunctions. keeping this in mind, by

10

change of the measure dxx = d  qn dan, we carry out the path-integration (2.32) to

obtain

k(bb, t ; aa, 0) =(cid:18) 2

(2.38)

where n is a normalization constant and the prime in q
n indicates that the zero modes
are omitted in the product. if we denote by det m the minor corresponding to the rst
f  f part of a d  d matrix m , then from the property (which we shall show later),

det(p (t ) u(t )) 6= 0,

(2.39)

we nd

f

yk=1

((t )  p (t ) uuk(t )) = |det(p (t ) u(t ))|1

(i(t )) .

(2.40)

thus, if we let m(t ) be the morse index of the operator  (associated with the period
[0, t ]) which gives the number of non-positive modes n  0 in (2.35), and combine (2.40)
with (2.34), we get the kernel in the polar form,

k(bb, t ; aa, 0) = r(t )

f

yi=1

(cid:16)(cid:2)u (t )(bb  hh(aa))(cid:3)i(cid:17) ei(bb,t ;aa,0) .

the phase part is given by

(bb, t ; aa, 0) :=

1
h

i[xx] 


2

m(t ) +  ,

(2.41)

(2.42)

where  is a constant independent of t , and we have replaced i[xx + ] with i[xx] under the

presence of the delta-functions in (2.41). the result (2.41) shows that, when caustics occur,

allowed transitions are those satisfying (t ) = 00, that is, those whose boundaries admit

classical solutions. in other words, classically forbidden processes remain to be forbidden

even quantum mechanically.

the key ingredient for determining the modulus part r(t ) of the kernel (2.41) is the

unitarity relation,

(ai  ci) =z

yi=1

dbi k (bb, t ; cc, 0) k(bb, t ; aa, 0) .

(2.43)

plugging (2.41) into (2.43) and noticing

(bb, t ; aa, 0)  (bb, t ; cc, 0) =

h

d

xj=f +1

xij(ai  ci)bj + (aa  cc) ,

(2.44)

where (aa  cc) stands for the terms which are independent of bb and vanish at aa = cc, we
observe that the r.h.s. of (2.43) becomes

from this the modulus part is found to be

r(t ) = (2h) df

2 p| det z| .

(2.47)

(2.48)

we here point out that the fact det z 6= 0 can be shown directly, but it is also obvious
from the observation that otherwise the r.h.s. of (2.47) does not match the l.h.s. due to

the dierence in the structure of delta-functions.

12

it remains to determine the constant  in the phase factor (2.42). we do this by

looking at the initial condition for the kernel,

lim
t 0+

k(bb, t ; aa, 0) =

d

yi=1

(bi  ai) .

(2.49)

note that the limit t  0 cannot be taken for our kernel (2.41), since caustics take place
only at nite t . however, the formal limit still makes sense if we put u (t )  u (0) = 0
and v (t )  v (0) = 1 in (2.41) and thereby isolate the delta-functionsqf
i=1 ([u (t )(bb
hh(aa))]i)  qf
i=1 (bi  ai) so that the rest of the kernel describes the transition on the
caustics plane. to use (2.49), we also have to evaluate the classical action in the phase

factor for the solution (2.8), but for our purpose we only need the asymptotic form of the

solution,

xx(t) = aa + (bb  aa)

t
t

+ o(t ) ,

which leads to the classical action,

i[xx] =

1
(bb  aa)  p (0)(bb  aa)
2t
1
(bb  aa)  p (0)(bb  aa) +
4

+

1
2

(bb + aa)  q(0)(bb  aa) + o(t ) .

(2.50)

(2.51)

from (2.46) we observe that det z reduces in the limit to det x which is given by the
minor corresponding to the last (d  f )  (d  f ) part of the matrix x. thus from the
classical action (2.51) we nd

| det z| = t (df )detp (0) + o(t (df )+1) .

(2.52)

with the help of the identity lim0(2i)n/2 eixxaxx/2 = (det a)1/2(n)(xx) valid for an
n-dimensional vector xx and an n  n matrix a, together with the property m(t ) = 0 for
t  0, we can readily evaluate the (formal) limit of the kernel (2.41) to get

k(bb, t ; aa, 0) = i

df

2 ei

lim
t 0+

d

yi=1

(bi  ai) .

(2.53)

comparing with (2.49) we nd that the constant  is determined by ei = i(df )/2.

having found both the modulus and the phase part, we obtain the closed form of the

(2.56)

is indeed the standard one (1.1) for the quadratic system (with the phase correction by

the morse index included)  here we derived it directly from the unitarity relation (2.43)

and the initial condition (2.49) without relying on involved procedures, such as one using

discretized multiple integrations and recursion relations employed in the literature. we

also mention that, with the generic jacobi elds j(t) satisfying (2.31), the transition kernel

(2.56) becomes the generalized gelfand-yaglom formula obtained previously [8].

before closing this section, we wish to prove the property (2.39) used to obtain the

kernel (2.41). to this end, rst we assume that (2.39) does not hold. then we can nd
a linear combination uu(t) := pf
k=1 ckuuk(t) out of the solutions {uuk; k = 1, . . . , f} such
that p (t ) uu(t ) = (0, )t , where 0 is an f -dimensional null vector. but since (2.23) is
equivalent to u t (t ) p (t ) uuk(t ) = 0 for k = 1, . . . , f , we deduce u t (t ) p (t ) uu(t ) = 0.
this suggests that the last df components of the vector p (t ) uu(t ) also vanish identically,
i.e., p (t ) uu(t ) is actually a null vector. then from the positive deniteness of p (t ) we

nd uu(t ) = 0. combined with uu(t ) = 0 which follows from the caustics conditions, we

come to the conclusion that (uu(t ), uu(t )) = 0 as a 2d-dimensional vector. this however
contradicts with the non-triviality of the solutions {uuk}, {vvk} at t = t ,

det(cid:18) u (t ) v (t )

v (t )(cid:19) 6= 0 ,

u (t )

(2.57)

which ensures that, as a set of 2d-dimensional vectors, (uuk(t ), uuk(t )) (together with

(vvk(t ), vvk(t ))) for k = 1, . . . , d form a complete basis. we therefore see that our as-

sumption is wrong, proving (2.39) as claimed.

3. caustics under external electromagnetic fields

in this section we provide two examples to illustrate caustic phenomena for a particle

in three dimensions. the rst example discusses partial caustics f = 2, which however

can be more naturally viewed as two-dimensional full caustics plus a decoupled motion

in the third dimension. the second example shows non-trivial partial caustics f = 1.

electromagnetic elds are used as driving forces acting on the test particle, and the two

examples show that caustics with dierent focal dimensions are possible for dierent eld

congurations.

3.1. full caustics

let us consider a point particle with mass m and charge q subject to a non-static but
uniform electric eld eeext = (ex(t), ey(t), ez(t))t and, assuming an appropriate back-
ground current, a static uniform magnetic eld bbext = (0, 0, b)t . these elds can be
2 (y, x, 0)t , and a scalar
derived from a vector potential aa in the symmetric gauge, aa = b
potential  is given by  = xx  eeext. noting the position of the particle by xx = (x, y, z)t
its lagrangian reads

l0 :=

m
2

xx2 + q xx  aa  q .

(3.1)

although essentially the same model has been considered in [13], we re-examine it in detail

to illuminate the phenomenon of caustics from our point of view.

due to the special eld conguration the lagrangian (3.1) splits into two parts,

l0 = l + lz ,

(3.2)

of which lz = m

2 z2  qez(t)z describes an accelerated motion in the z-direction whereas
(3.3)

l =

m

2 (cid:0)rr2 + rr  rr(cid:1)  qee  rr ,

governs the motions in the xy-plane where we use rr = (x, y)t and ee = (ex, ey)t . we
have also introduced the cyclotron angular velocity  := qb/m and the skew matrix

 = (cid:18) 0
1

1

0(cid:19). by splitting o the z-component in (3.2) we obtain the system (3.3) on

which we shall concentrate in the following.

as is evident from the discussion in the previous section, the intrinsic behavior of
the system on caustics does not depend on terms linear in the coordinates, qee  xx.

15

without this term the system exhibits the discrete symmetry under the parity conjugation
(x(t), )  (y(t), ), which has important consequences on the caustics.

the equation of motion for a classical path rr reads

 rr + ss = 0 ,

in which the dierential operator  and the nonlinear term ss are given by

 = m

d2
dt2 1 + m

d
dt

,

ss(t) = qee(t) ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

where 1 denotes a two by two unit matrix. to provide a special solution of (3.4) we focus
on the rst time derivative yy(t) := rr(t), which fullls

m(yy + 2yy) + q(ee + ee) = 0 .

this equation is solved by

yy(t) = 

q

m z t

0

dt sin (t  t){ee(t) + ee(t)} + gg(t) ,

(3.6)

(3.7)

wherein gg(t) stands for solutions to the homogeneous part of (3.6) given by a linear com-

bination of sin t and cos t. by integrating the solution (3.7) and thereby imposing the

boundary condition ss(0) = 00 we obtain the special solution,

ss(t) =

q

m

z t

0

dt(cid:16)e(tt)  1(cid:17) e(t) .

(3.8)

on the other hand, the solution space of the homogeneous part of (3.4) is formed by the

four independent functions,

(cid:18) 1
0(cid:19) , (cid:18) 0

1(cid:19) , (cid:18) sin t

cos t(cid:19) , (cid:18) cos t

 sin t(cid:19) .

(3.9)

in particular, the jacobi elds vv1 and vv2 which satisfy (2.6) are given by the rst two

constant vectors, respectively, while uu1 and uu2 are given by linear combinations of the

four. the general solution for the equation of motion (3.4) is then obtained by (2.8) (with

xx replaced by rr).

in order to establish the conditions for caustics, let us consider the eigenvalue equation

(2.35) with (2.36) for the present case. although the eigenfunctions of this equation can

16

be found in the usual manner, for completeness let us briey comment on their derivation.
first, for the eigenfunctions we make the ansatz n(t) = cc eit, where cc is a constant
complex two-vector and  a complex number. from (2.35) one deduces the coecient
equation [(m2  n)1 + im]cc = 0, which in turn implies that  can take one of the
following four values,

+2+(4n/m)
+2+(4n/m)

1 =

3 =

to each of which there corresponds a xed vector cc = cci given by cc1 = cc2 = (i, 1)t and
cc3 = cc4 = (i, 1)t , respectively. the general solution to (2.35) reads (ai complex)

(cid:18) i
1(cid:19) (a1ei1t + a2ei2t) +(cid:18)i

1 (cid:19) (a3ei3t + a4ei4t) ,

(3.11)

upon which the boundary condition in (2.35) is to be imposed. this leads to a1 + a2 = 0,
a3 + a4 = 0, ei1t = ei2t , and ei3t = ei4t , from which we infer m2 + 4n > 0 and
deduce the eigenvalues

for positive integer n. there exist two real eigenfunctions to each eigenvalue, namely,

n =

the discrete symmetry of the lagrangian (3.3). clearly, zero modes n = 0 appear if

and complete. the twofold degeneracy comes from

 = n

where n :=

2n
t

,

(3.15)

in which case caustics occur. note that at any of the above n for some positive integer

n, there appear two zero modes due to the degeneracy. we thus nd that, as far as the

the motions on the xy-plane are concerned, we have the full caustics, f = 2.

17

let us turn our attention to quantum mechanics and obtain the transition amplitude

on the caustics at  = n. being the full caustics, the amplitude can be obtained immedi-
ately by using the general formula for the kernel (2.55), where now we have | det v (t )| = 1
and hh(aa) = aa + ss(t ) with ss(t ) being the endpoint value of the special solution (3.8). we

also notice from (3.12) that the morse index is given by m(t ) = 2n (where the factor 2

comes from the twofold degeneracy) and the classical action reads

i[rr] = 

q

aa z t

(3.16)

k(bb, t ; aa, 0) = (1)n (2)(bb  aa  ss(t )) e

i

h i[rr] .

(3.17)

so far we have discussed the two dimensional subsystem governed by the lagrangian

l, which reveals full caustics at  = n. when the total system l0 in (3.2) is considered,

these caustics are only partial, since the motion in the z-direction is free of caustics. this
fact is also expressed in the total transition amplitude from the initial position (ax, ay, az)t
to the nal one (bx, by, bz)t , which is the product of the kernel (3.17) and the contribution
coming from the z-component

k(bb, t ; aa, 0)  kz(bz, t ; az, 0),

where kz(bz, t ; az, 0) can be calculated as

kz(bz, t ; az, 0) =r m

(3.19)

(3.20)

since the z-component bz of the endpoint can take an arbitrary value, depending on the

initial momentum in this direction, the set of image points of an initial point aa makes up

a straight line in the z-direction. the transition kernel obtained here, (3.18) with (3.17),

(3.19) and (3.20), agrees with the one [13] obtained previously by a dierent method.

18

3.2. partial caustics

the above example, when viewed as that of partial caustics, is rather trivial due to

the decoupling of the z-component. however, partial caustics do not always have such

a trivial situation. to examine a non-trivial case of partial caustics let us consider the

following lagrangian in three dimensions,

l =

m
2

( x2 + y2 + z2) +

qb
2

(x y  y x)  qyz .

(3.21)

it describes a point particle of mass m and charge q moving in a static uniform magnetic
eld in the z-direction bbext = (0, 0, b)t and a static but non-uniform electric eld eeext =
(0, z, y)t ,  6= 0. introducing  = qb/m and  = q/m the equation of motion reads

 xx(t) +

 xx(t) = 00 .

(3.22)

we note that, like the previous example, the lagrangian and the equation of motion are

invariant under the parity transformation,

(x, y, z, , )  (x,y, z, , ) .

(3.23)

in order to construct classical solutions we make the ansatz xx(t) = hheit (hh a complex

constant vector and  a complex number) and substitute it into (3.22), yielding

(3.28)

with a, b, c, d, e, and f some real constants.

to judge whether or not caustics occur in this system we have to examine zero-modes,

i.e., classical solutions with vanishing boundary conditions xx(0) = xx(t ) = 00. the initial

condition put into (3.28) gives

a = (f  d), c =




e, b =

(3.29)

and so the jacobi eld becomes dww1(t) + eww2(t) + f ww3(t) with

one sucient condition for caustics is clearly seen to be given by3

 = () = n ,

(3.32)

with n appearing in (3.15), which is indirectly a condition on the cyclotron frequency .

in this case the coecients in (3.28) for the zero-mode solution read

a = d, d = arbitrary, b = c = e = f = 0 .

(3.33)

since there is just one zero-mode, we have the partial caustics situation f = 1, d = 3.

the vectors wwi(t), i = 1, 2, 3, are related to the special choice of the jacobi elds uui(t) in

(2.11) to (2.12) in the following way

uu1(t) = m ww1(t),

the function uu1(t) is the zero-mode solution, and the caustics surface is spanned by the

two independent vectors uu2(t ) and uu3(t ), see fig. 2. on the other hand, the set of jacobi
elds vvi(t), i = 1, 2, 3, with the boundary conditions vj
i (0) = 0 introduced
in (2.6) can be expressed as follows

i (0) = j

at this point it is worth mentioning the behavior of the jacobi elds on caustics in
the limit   0, since in this limit the lagrangian (3.21) reduces to the lagrangian (3.1)
3 besides this, there can be other caustics, i.e., those which occur at  6= n for which the determinant

(3.31) vanishes.

(3.38)

we see that ww1(t)/ goes over into the upper vector and ww2(t) into the lower vector of
(3.37). whereas ww1(t) is already a zero-mode of the original system ww2(t) is not, which

22

nonetheless turns into a zero-mode in the limit. on the other hand, ww3(t)/ goes over into
the function (0, 0, t)t , which describes free motion of the z-component in the direction of

the caustics line.

when passed over to quantum mechanics, the transition amplitude for the present

partial caustics can also be obtained from the general formula (2.54). however, we shall

not record it here as it becomes rather cumbersome due to the structure of the matrix

z(t ) in (2.46).

23

4. conclusion

in this paper we studied caustics in quantum mechanics in multi-dimensions for la-

grangians which are at most quadratic by extending our previous study in one-dimension

[14, 16]. our main result is the kernel formula (2.54) which gives the transition amplitude

in d-dimensions. as in one-dimension, we found that transitions prohibited classically

remain to be so even quantum mechanically. the complication that arises in the multi-

dimensional case is that we now have partial caustics, that is, the dimension of the caustics

surface where the classical trajectories (and hence the quantum amplitudes) concentrate

is not zero but smaller than d. more precisely, one looks at the number f of zero modes of

the operator dened by the quadratic part of the lagrangian, and if f = d caustics take

place maximally in all directions (full caustics), if f = 0 there arises none (non-caustics),

and otherwise we have partial caustics. for the full caustics case, the transition kernel has

been previously obtained in [9] based on a dierent formalism of the path-integral (sum

over all continuous vector elds along a classical path vanishing at boundaries). here we

have adopted a more intuitive and seemingly easier method presented in [4], and thereby

obtained the kernel formula explicitly for generic caustics.

in the full caustics case the

kernel formula we obtained reduces to the one given in [9] as required, whereas in the

non-caustics case it recovers the one (gelfand-yaglom formula) which is familiar in semi-

classical approximations. the crucial ingredient of our derivation is the unitarity relation

combined with the initial condition satised by the kernel, and to our amusement our

method turns out to be much simpler than the previous ones [15, 8] to get the well-known

van-vleck formula for semiclassical approximations.

the two examples we presented illustrate how partial caustics occur both classically

and quantum mechanically. the rst is the system of a charged particle under constant

magnetic and electric elds perpendicular to each other, which is found to be the case

d = 3 and f = 2. the caustics observed there is, however, not quite partial intrinsically,

because one can nd an appropriate frame of coordinates in which the partial caustics can

be regarded as being a sum of d = 1 non-caustics and d = 2 full caustics. the second

example is given by the system of a charged particle under a certain (rather eccentric)

electric eld and provides the case d = 3 and f = 1. in contrast to the rst example,

this does not seem to admit a trivial decoupling into full and non-caustics beforehand and

hence may be regarded as one which exhibits intrinsic partial caustics.

24

for further extension of the present work, one obvious direction is to study quantum

caustics in eld theory, especially in the context where the semiclassical approximation

becomes important. this includes analyses of solitons/instantons in, e.g., the sine-gordon

theory, nonlinear sigma models, and the yang-mills theory possibly coupled to various

matter elds. (in fact it was the question of the role of intantons in the nonlinear sigma

model [17, 18] which led us to the study of caustics originally [14].) another direction is to

nd applications in condensed matter physics, where often situations like the rst example

of section 3 are considered. to this end we feel that the quantum feature of caustics

should be addressed in various physical aspects, such as in the spread of wave packets in

the gaussian slit experiment [16]. we hope that our present study serves as a basis for

future investigations associated with caustics phenomena including those mentioned here.
