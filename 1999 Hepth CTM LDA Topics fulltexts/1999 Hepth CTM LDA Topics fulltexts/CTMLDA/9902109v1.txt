jection this model is equivalent to the fermionic massive string and to the non-critical
rammond-neveu-schwarz string. the spin spectrum of the model is analysed. for
d = 4 the character generating functions is obtained and the particle content of rst

1 introduction

it was recently shown that the covariant quantization of the rammond-neveu-schwarz
string modied by adding the supersymmetric liouville sector with vanishing cosmological
constants leads in the dimensions 1 < d < 10 to a family of tachyon free unitary models [1].
for every member of this family the neveu-schwarz sector does not contain any massless
states which justies the name  fermionic massive string  introduced in [1]. one of the
quantum models characterised by the largest subspace of null states is equivalent to the
non-critical rns spinning string truncated in the neveu-schwarz sector to a tachyon free
subspace of the fermion parity operator. it is called the critical fermionic massive string.
the aim of the present paper is to develop the light-cone formulation of this model.
our motivation is twofold. first of all the light-cone formulation seems indispensable
for analysing the splitting-joining interaction. secondly, it can be used to calculate the
particle content of the model.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we dene a quantum free string model
directly in the light-cone variables. we shall call it the fermionic non-critical light-cone
string or simply the light-cone string. in this model the longitudinal degrees of freedom
are described by a background charge fock space realisation [2] of the superconformal
verma module with the central charge c = 10  d, and the highest weight h = 1
2. a
similar construction motivated by the liouville theory was rst discussed by marnelius
in the context of the non- critical polyakov fermionic string [3]. the gso projection is
introduced as a projection on a suitably chosen eigenspace of the (world-sheet) fermion
parity operator.

in section 3 we show that after the gso projection the fermionic non-critical light-cone
string is equivalent to the critical massive string and therefore to the suitably projected
rammond-neveu-schwarz non-critical string.

in section 4 the spectrum of the light-cone string is analysed. for d = 4 the expansion
of the character generating function in terms of irreducible characters is derived.
it is
illustrated by numerical calculations of spin content of rst few levels. the spectrum of
the gso projected tachyon free model is also calculated. the corresponding results for
the closed non-critical light-cone string are presented in section 5. an interesting feature
of the model is that the closed string spectrum does not contain space-time fermions.

the spectra of the open and the closed critical massive strings derived in this paper
exclude the fundamental string interpretation of the model. it might be however a good
candidate for an eective low energy description of strong interactions.
it shares two
important features of the critical fermionic string - the light-cone formulation and the
absence of tachyons. whether it is enough for a consistent interaction is an interesting
open problem.

2 fermionic non-critical light-cone string

let us x a light-cone frame {e, e1, . . . , ed2} in d-dimensional minkowski space nor-
malised by e2
= 0, e+  e = 1, and ei  ej = ij for i, j = 1, . . . , d  2. we shall use the

following notation for the light-cone components of a vector v

v  = e  v , v i = ei  v , v = v iei

.

in the rammond sector ( = 0) the fermionic zero modes bi

cliord algebra c(d  1, 0). if one requires a well dened fermion parity operator the
zero mode sector of h0(p+, p) must carry a representation of the cliord algebra c(d, 0).
we assume that this sector is described by an irreducible representation d(d) of the
complexied cliord algebra cc(d) = c(d, 0)  ci, and

the representation of the algebra (1) on h0(p+, p) is given by

h0(p+, p) = f0(p+, p)  d(d)

that in the covariant massive string model the eigenvalue  of the bosonic liouville zero
mode c0 is restricted by the constraint c0 = 0. in the present construction it is regarded
as a free real parameter.

it follows from (2) that for 2 small enough the ground states in the neveu-schwarz
sector are tachyonic. one can try to solve this problem by introducing the gso projection
dr dr be the fermion number operator on f(p+, p). we

[4]. let f =pr>0
introduce the fermion parity operators on the total hilbert space h = h0  h1 :

br  br +pr>0

(1)f = (1) f0  f  (1) f1+1

.

the gso projection is dened as the projection on the +1 eigenspace of (1)f . in the
case of even dimensions there exists another operator  with all the properties of the
fermion parity operator, and anticommuting with (1)f . one can show that the gso
projections with respect to , and (1)f lead to equivalent models.

3 equivalence to other models

in this section we shall show that the light-cone string is equivalent to the critical fermionic
massive string recently introduced in [1]. in the covariantly quantized fermionic massive
string the conditions for physical states can be solved in terms of the transversal ai
m, bi
r,
the super-liouville cm, dr, and the shifted longitudinal al
r . for details concerning
the ddf construction and the notation used in this section we refer to [1].

m, bl

m, bi

32 , m2

the critical fermionic massive string corresponds to a special choice of the parameters
 = 9d
0 = 0. in this case all states containing the shifted longitudinal excitations
are null. the space of physical states can be identied with all states generated by the
transverse and the super-liouville ddf operators ai
r, cm, dr. they have the same
(anti)commutation relations and the conjugation properties, as the light-cone excitations
ai
m, bi
r, cm, dr. also the continuous spectra of the bosonic zero modes in both models are
identical. in the critical massive string the representation of the transverse, the liouville,
and the fermion parity gamma matrices on the on-mass-shell physical states coincides
with the representation d(d). the only dierence is that in the covariant model one
gets a neutral, while in the light-cone string a positive denite scalar product. this
discrepancy is not essential - the subspaces with denite products in the covariant model
are eigenspaces of the the fermion parity operator [1]. note that the neutral product of
the covariant model is a consequence of the assumption that the zero and the non-zero
fermionic modes have the same conjugation properties.

one way to show the equivalence of the poincare group representations is to calculate
the commutators of the poincare generators with the ddf operators. this calculations
can be facilitated by the technique of the leading terms [8]. it is based on the observa-
tion that the ddf operators expressed in terms of elementary excitations are uniquely
determined by they leading terms i.e. parts of such expressions which do not contain any

cone commutators. one can easily check that this is also true for all the other generators.
we have shown that the gso projected fermionic light-cone string is isomorphic to
the gso projected critical massive string. the latter model is equivalent to the non-
critical rammond-neveu-schwarz string truncated in the neveu-schwartz sector to the
tachion free eigenspace of the fermion parity operator [1]. one thus has three equivalent
descriptions of the same fermionic non-critical string model.

4 spin spectrum

the problem of the spin spectrum is to decompose the unitary representation of the
poincare group on the hilbert space of string into irreducible representation. it follows
from formula (2) that the decomposition of h into representations of a xed mass coin-
cides with the level structure

h = mn0z dp+

r h n

 (p+, p) = n h n

for 2 in the range 0  2 < d1

and for 2 > d1

the lowest level subspace h 0

1 in the neveu-schwarz
1 is a massless,

8 , h 0

5

in the rammond sector the 0-level subspaces h 0

0 (p+, p) are by construction isomorphic
with the irreducible representation d(d) of the complex cliord algebra cc(d). for a
massive momentum (2 > 0) the representation of the little group spin(d  1) on d(d)
is a direct sum of two isomorphic fundamental irreducible representations s(d  1) of
spin(d  1).
in the massless case (2 = 0) the maximal compact subgroup of the little group is
spin(d  2). in the odd dimensions d(d) is a direct sum of two fundamental irreducible
representations of spin(d  2) while in the even dimensions it is a direct sum of four such
representations. in particular for d = 4 and 2 = 0 the zero level in the rammond sector
contains two pairs of the left, and the right weyl spinors.

since all higher levels are massive, the spaces h n

 (p+, p) should be decomposed into
irreducible representations of the little group spin(d  1). for every momentum p with
m2 = (2n + 2   d1
8 ), n > 0, one can choose a light-cone frame such that p+ =
, p = 0, and the little group is generated by

.

we shall use the method developed in the case of the bosonic light-cone string [5]. it relies
on the observation that, as far as the character generating function is concerned, the vector
representation of spin(d  2) formed by the transverse excitation can be extended to a
vector representation of spin(d1) by means of the liouville excitations. the only novelty
is that in the present case we have two vector representations v b

the creation operators

where dv denotes the vector representation of spin(d 1), and ii is the set of all positive
integers. the expansions of (t, g) in terms of irreducible characters can be found using
the techniques developed by curtright and thorn [7] for strings with only transverse
excitations. in the case of d = 4 one gets:

and l() is the character of the spin l irreducible representation of spin(d  1). for
2 = 0 the spin spectrum up to 6-th level is presented on fig.1.
the doubling of the spectrum in the rammond sector (3) is related to the presence of
the fermionic zero mode in the liouville sector. for all dimensions in the range 1 < d < 10
the gso projection removes this doubling without any extra conditions for the parameters
of the model. in the neveu-schwarz sector it simply removes the integer levels. the gso
truncated spectrum is presented on fig.2.

5 closed string

the closed string hilbert space hc can be constructed as the subspace of the tensor

product of two copies of the open string hilbert spaces (h0 h1) (fh0 fh1) determined

since the mass levels of dierent sectors of the open non-critical string never coincide

c0 = ec0 =  ,
and anihillated by the twist operator t = (r0  r1)  1  1  (er0  er1).
(2) the mixed sectors h0fh1, h1fh0 are excluded. in consequence the spectrum of the

closed fermionic string does not contain space-time fermions. this is in fact a common
feature of all the covariant closed string models corresponding to the family of non-critical
open strings considered in [1].

the representation of the poincare generators are constructed in a standard manner.
in particular, the hamiltonian p  generating the x+-evolution, and the mass square
operator m 2 are given by

p c =



p + (l0 + el0  1)

 = 4(r + er + 2   d1

the character generating function can be calculated as the diagonal part (i.e. all terms
of the form tn tn ) of the product of two open string generating functions

(closed)



( t, g) = diag((t, g)(t, g))|t=t .

for d = 4, and 2 = 0 the results of the numerical calculations of rst few levels, before,
and after gso projection are presented on fig.3, and on fig.4, respectively.
