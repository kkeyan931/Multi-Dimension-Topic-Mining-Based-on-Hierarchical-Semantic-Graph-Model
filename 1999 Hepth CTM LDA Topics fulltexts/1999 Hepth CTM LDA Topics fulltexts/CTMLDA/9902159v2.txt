abstract

lienard-wiechert potentials of the relativistic spinning particle with anomalous magnetic
moment in pseudoclassical theory are constructed. general expressions for the lienard-
wiechert potentials are used for investigation of some specic cases of the motion of the
spinning particle. in particular the spin dependence of the intensity of the synchrotron radi-
ation of the transversely polarized particle performing uniform circular motion is considered.
when the particle moves in the external homogeneous magnetic eld the obtained formulae
coincide with those known from quantum theory of radiation. the dependence of the polar-
ization of the synchrotron radiation on the spin of the particle is investigated.

1.the introduction of grassmann variables into the theory allowed to construct theories
of the point particles, which describe the spin of the particle already at the classical level
[1, 2]. these theories are known as pseudoclassical theories and are classical gauge theories
with constraints. methods for quantization of these theories are presented in [3, 4, 5]. the
possibility of consistent description of the spin in external elds using grassmann variables
already at the classical level allows to investigate spin eects in a number of physical pro-
cesses using classical equations of motion. note that description of the spin in classical
theories without grassmann variables is also possible, however these theories do not give
after quantization the accepted quantum relativistic dirac particle (see the review [6] and
references therein).

in this paper in the pseudoclassical approach the lienard-wiechert potentials for a
charged relativistic spinning particle with anomalous magnetic moment (amm) interacting
with the external electromagnetic eld are obtained (a self-contained pseudoclassical theory
of the interaction of the spinning particle with amm with the external electromagnetic eld
was constructed in [7, 8, 9]). using these expressions for the lienardwiechert potentials
certain cases of the charged particle movement are considered.
in particular the general
expressions for the dependences of the intensity and the polarization of the synchrotron ra-
diation on the polarization of the particle for the transversely polarized particle performing
a uniform circular motion are obtained.
investigations were carried out in quadratic ap-
proximation in the grassman variables, or, which is the same, to the rst order in the spin.
in this approximation, in the case of the movement in the homogeneous magnetic eld, the
obtained formulae (when the dependence of the eective mass of the particle on the strengt
of the magnetic eld is taken into account) coincide with similar formulae obtained in the
classical radiation theory [10], as well as with those in quantum theory [11].

it is important to stress, that within our approach the evaluation of the formulae, de-
scribing the spin dependence of the measurable characteristics of the relativistic particle
radiation is much easier, than in quantum electrodynamics.

note, that these potentials were constructed also for investigation of the problem of
(classical) renormalization of the pseudoclassical equations of motion of the electron with
radiation reaction taken into account. the results of these investigations will be reported in
the separate paper.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we describe the lagrangian of the pseu-
doclassical theory of the spinning particle with amm interacting with the electromagnetic
eld. the equations of motion and xation of the gauges are written down, additional gauge
xing conditions are imposed and general expressions for the lienardwiechert potentials
are given. in section 3 the case of the particle at rest with precessing spin is considered.
in section 4 the expressions for the synchrotron radiation eld strengths for the relativistic
transversely polarized spinning particle performing a uniform circular motion are deduced
and the dependences of the intensity and the polarization of the synchrotron radiation on the
polarization of the particle are obtained. the special case of the movement in the external
homogeneous magnetic eld is considered in details.

2. thus, consider the action of the theory, describing the interaction of the relativistic
spinning particle with anomalous magnetic moment (amm) with electromagnetic eld in
the space time dimensions d = 4 [7, 8, 9]):

here x( ) is particle coordinate, , ( ) are grassmann variables, describing spin degrees
of freedom, 5( ),  and e are additional elds (e is an even element, 5 and  are odd elements
of grassmann algebra) , a is the vector-potential of the electromagnetic eld, f = a
a; g is the charge of the particle, (g)- the anomalous magnetic moment, m = 12gm/g
is the total magnetic moment of the particle in bohr magnetons; the overdote denotes the
dierentiation over  along the trajectory; the derivatives over grassmann variables are left.
the theory (1) has three gauge symmetries: reparametrization and supersymmetry [8],
and also the u(1) gauge symmetry of electromagnetic interactions. they correspond to the
presence of three primary constraints of the rst class in the lagrangian formulation of the
theory. fixation of the latter will be accomplished below.

to obtain the expression for lienard-wiechert potentials well write the equation for the

electromagnetic eld a and also for the elds e, 5 and :

s

a(y)

= f (y) + gz d x(x( )  y)  2igz d ( x  x)5(x( )  y) +

now we will x one of the gauges of the theory by imposing the condition



x  = 0,

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

which due to relation (4) is equivalent to 5 = 0. using the latter equality from equations
(3) and (5) we nd the expressions for the auxiliary elds e and :

e = vuut

(the choice of the sign of e in the expression (7) is dictated by the positivity of the energy
in nonrelativistic limit).

the expansion of the right hand side of these expressions in powers of  is carried out
with taking into account the fact that the powers of  higher than four are equal to zero.
substituting in (2) e by the expressions (7) and inserting 5 = 0 we get the following equation
for the eld a:

(cid:16)a  a(cid:17) (y) +  2g2

h x  xi xf = j(y),



where j(y) is given by the expression

j(y) = gz d x(x( )  y)  2ig

(9)

further simplication of this equation is achieved by the following. let us x two remaining
gauges of the theory. to do this we will choose the gauge condition for the eld a in

the form a = 0, and will identify the parameter  with the proper time of the particle,
which means xation of the u(1) and reparametrization degrees of freedom correspondingly.
then we get x2 = 1. also we will consider only those terms of the equation (8), which
contain powers of  no higher than two. this limitations are equivalent to quasiclassical
approximation since after quantization of the theory the terms containing second orders of
 will be proportional to h (the terms, containing the fourth power of  will give rise to
corrections of the order of h2 [1, 2]). taking into account all this, we can rewrite the equation
(8) in the form:

2a = j,

(10)

where j is given by the expression (9). it is convenient to represent the current vector j
as a sum of two terms:

j(y) = gz d x(x( )  y) +



y z d (x( )  y)p( ),

where

p =

i
m {gm  2gm [ x  x] ( x)} ,

p = p.

(11)

(12)

the rst summand in (11) corresponds to the current of the charged particle without the
dipole moment. the second term corresponds to the contribution to the current of the dipole
moment of the spinning particle.

it is easy to see, that due to (6) the electric dipole moment of the particle q, which is

connected with p by the relation q = p


x  (see e.g. [12]), is equal to zero:

q =

ig
m

(


x ) = 0,

(13)

as it should be for a point particle.

we will show now, that from the pseudoclassical expression (12) for p follows, that, as
expected, the total magnetic moment of the particle is directed along the spin of the particle.
to do this we will use the expression, connecting the vector of the magnetic moment of the
particle m with the tensor of the dipole moment p [12]:

m =

1
2




x p.

(14)

taking into account, that in the gauge  = 0 , (

x  = ep  [9] ( p =
(e, ~p) is 4-momentum of the particle ), which using (7) and dropping terms proportional to
4, takes the form (for x2 = 1)


x ) = 0 we have





x  = p /me, me = m +

igm
2m

f .

(15)

the analog of the relation between the 4-momentum of the particle and its mass in this case
e + o()4 = 0, while the sign    in (15) is connected with the
has the form of p 2
denition of the generalized momentum, conjugated to the coordinate of the particle.

inserting the expressions (12) and (15) into (14) and dropping the terms proportional to

4, we get

here w  denotes the pseudoclassical analog of the pauli- lubansky vector and is dened as

w = i

p,

(17)

a/2 is the relativistic generalization of the pseudoclassical spin vector (after canonical quan-
tization the vector a becomes a polarization four vector of the spinning particle). from (16)
follows the proportionality of the magnetic moment of the particle to the polarization vector
with the coecient equal to the total magnetic moment of the particle.

from the identity

p = (cid:16)

with accounting for (13) and (16) follows the equation

the solution of the equation (10) (with the current represented in the form of (11)) in

in formulae (20) and (21) the expressions in the square brackets correspond to the con-
tribution to the a and f of the charge of the particle, while those in the parentheses
correspond to the contribution of the dipole moment.

inserting the explicit expression (12) for p in (20)-(24) we obtain the general form of
the retarded lienard-wiechert solution for the electromagnetic eld strengths of the charged
spinning particle in the pseudoclassical theory.

3. to disclose the correspondence between the obtained pseudoclassical expressions for
lienard-wiechert potentials and well known classical formulae for the strengths of the electric
and magnetic elds of the charged particle with a magnetic moment, we will consider the
case of the spinning particle at rest (

0 ) with precessing spin


x  = 


x i = 0,

from formulae (21)-(24) we nd the expression for the eld strengths of the electromag-

netic eld of the particle at rest:

where n = r/r = (1, ~n), r = r0 = qr2

,

(25)

3 (for retarded elds r0 = y0  x0( ) >
0). the formula (25) was obtained with taking into account the fact that in the rest frame
p0i = 0, which follows from (19). from formula (19) at ~v = 0 it also follows, that

1 + r2

2 + r2

pij =

gm

m2 ijk0w k 

x 0 = 

gm
m2 ijkwk

(ijk = 0ijk = 0ijk, 123 = 1).

taking into account, that in the rest frame of the particle we have [15]:

where si is the spin of the particle, we get

wi = msi,

pij =

gm
m

ijksk.

hence


pij and


pij are equal to


pij=

pij=

m

ijk

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

let now the spin of the particle be precessing around certain axis with a constant angular
velocity ~, i.e.

substituting (30) into (29) we obtain



si= h~ ~sii

= iklksl.

(isj  jsi) ,


pij=

gm

m (cid:26)ih~ ~sij  jh~ ~sii(cid:27) .

using (28), (31) and also the equality p0i = 0, we nd from (25) the expressions for the
electric and magnetic eld strengths for the charged particle with precessing spin (the electric
ei and magnetic bi elds are dened as ei  (f 01, f 02, f 03), bi  (f 23, f 31, f 12)):

ei = f0i =

4mr2 n2h~ ~sii  3 [~~n]i(cid:16)~n~s(cid:17) + 3(~~n)h~s~niio .

gm

(33)

from these formulae one can deduce the expressions for the electric and magnetic elds of
the particle at rest with a xed vector of the magnetic moment:

ei =

bi =

g

4r2 ni,
gm
4mr3 n3(~n~s)ni  sio ,

(34)

the relations (32)-(34) coincide with the corresponding expressions for the particle with a

charge g and total magnetic moment ~ =

gm
m

~s [13].

4. here we will obtain the formulae for the electromagnetic eld strengths of synchrotron
radiation from particles in circular orbits. we will consider the case of transverse polarization
of the particle ( when the spin of the particle is perpendicular to the rotation plane). this
problem is interesting from the point of view of measuring the polarization of the particles
by the measurement of the synchrotron radiation.

it is well known, that the radiation eld is given by the terms in the expression (21),

proportional to 1/:

where p

is given by formula (22).

let us now transform the formula (35) taking into account the relations


x  = (1, ~v),

 = (r  (~v ~r)) = r(1  (~v~n)),  = 1/1  ~v2



x  = (cid:16)4(~v~a), 2~a + 4~v(~v~a)(cid:17) ,

where ~v  (vi) = dxi/dt is the three-velocity of the particle, ~a = d~v/dt, ~b = d~a/dt, dt/d =
(1  ~v2)1/2 = .
rad we obtain a well known
expression for the electric eld strength ech

substituting (36) into the rst term of expression (35) for f 

i of the charged spinless particle:

ech

i =

g

4r(1  (~v~n))3 [(ni  vi) (~a~n)  ai(1  (~v~n))] .

(37)

to transform the spin part p

rad, which contains the p, connected
with w  by the relation (19), we will make use of the relation between w and spin vector
of the particle in the rest frame ~s  (si) [15, 9] and retaining only terms quadratic in 2:

of the tensor f

e,

(p d

e = me,

~p d = me~v,

and me is the eective mass of the particle, which is dened by the relation (15).

also from (19) with (38) taken into account we have

in the case of the uniform circular motion of the transversely polarized particle considered
here (when the spin of the particle is along the vector of the external magnetic eld ~b) (see
g.1) the following relations hold:

(~v~a) = (~s~v) = (~s~a) = (~s~b) = 0,

in the case of the uniform circular movement of the transversely polarized particle apart

which is obtained using expressions (42) and (50), we can write the expression for the syn-
chrotron radiation rate of the particle per unit solid angle d and per unit time of the
particles own time (at the moment of radiation) t0:

di

dt0d

a2

(1  v cos )5 (cid:20)(1  v cos )2  (1  v2) sin2  cos2   2

(54)
where  and  are the angles dening the orientation of the vector ~n in the cartesian coor-
dinate system dened by three vectors ~v,~a and ~b(~s) (see g.1).

integrating the expression (54) over the solid angle we get for the radiation rate the

formula:

to compare this with the formulae obtained in quantum radiation theory, note, that the
eective mass of the particle, dened by the expression (15), in the case of motion in the
homogeneous external magnetic eld takes the form

me = m +

the right-hand side of the formula (56) is written on account of the relation (12) and the
gauge (6). substituting in (56) the expression for pij from (43) we nd for the me (to the
rst order in spin)

using (57) we obtain from (39) to the rst order in spin the relation

in deducing the last equation in (58) we used the relation gb = m. using now the equality
(58), the formula (55) can be rewritten in the form

on account of the relation s = 1
2, where  = 1 is the projection of the polarization vector
on the direction of the magnetic eld, we nd that this formula (59) coincides with that
found in the quantum theory of radiation (to the rst order in spin).

to investigate the characteristics of the polarization of synchrotron radiation we resolve
(following [16]) the electric eld strength ~erad into components along the vectors ~e = ~a/a
and [~n, ~e]:

~erad = e1~e + e2 [~n, ~e] ,

(60)

this choice of unit vectors is suitable for description of the radiation of the relativistic
particles using angles dened on fig.2, which are appropriate since the main contribution to
the radiation comes from small ( 1/) angles  and , in accordance with the fact, that
the angle between vectors ~n and ~v is of the order of ( 1/). as it was mentioned in [16],
the vector ~e is not orthogonal to vector ~n, however this deviation is of the order of 1/, so
that the decomposition (60) can be used for calculation of major terms (with accuracy 1/).
from formulae (37) and (52) we get according to decomposition (60) the expressions for e1
and e2:

,

(61)

(62)

e1 =

ga

(2 + 2)2 ! =r
4(22  2)
(2 + 2)2 ! =r

,

sb

where 2 = 2 + 2.

taking into account the equality (58), we rewrite the expression for 2 in the form

e (cid:19)2
2 = 2 +(cid:18)m

(63)

substituting now the expression for 2 into (61) and (62), we get to the rst order in

spin

e1 =

for 2

0  2 = 0 from (64) and (65) follows, that

from obtained formulae one can see, that in the direction  = m/e of the plane (~a~v) ( = 0)
there is a radiation (proportional to the spin), contrary to the case of particle without spin.
