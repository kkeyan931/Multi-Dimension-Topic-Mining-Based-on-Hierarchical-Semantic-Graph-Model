abstract

in a recent paper (hep-th/9811108), saveliev and the author showed that there exits
an on-shell light cone gauge where the non-linear part of the eld equations reduces
to a (super) version of yangs equations which may be solved by methods inspired by
the ones previously developed for self-dual yang-mills equations in four dimensions.
here, the analogy between these latter theories and the present ones is pushed further
by writing down a set of super partial linear dierential equations whose consistency
conditions may be derived from the susy y-m equations in ten dimensions, and which
are the analogues of the lax pair of belavin and zakharov. on the simplest example
of the two pole ansatz, it is shown that the same solution-generating techniques are
at work, as for the derivation of the celebrated multi-instanton solutions carried out
in the late seventies. the present lax representation, however, is only a consequence
of (instead of being equivalent to) the eld equations, in contrast with the belavin
zakharov lax pair.

1 introduction

the general solution of spherically symmetric self-dual yang-mills equations discovered by
lesnov and saveliev two decades ago has led to extraordinary developments. i met misha
for the rst time in 1992 when this work had already proven to be so important for two
dimensional conformal/integrable systems. we immediately started to collaborate and have
done so ever since. unlike many of his country men he felt that he should not leave his country
for good, and fought for his family and him-self while keeping a remarkable enthousiasm for
research. working with misha has been a wonderful experience which terminated so abruptly!
i will always remember our excited and friendly discussions, his kindness and enthousiam,
his fantastic knowledge of the scientic literature! we, at ecole normale, were lucky enough
to invite him for several extended visits which were extremely fruitful. misha and i also
met in other places, but altogether much too rarely, and exchanged uncountably many email
messages. now i am sorry for the many occasions to meet him that i had to decline. in
particular i never found time to visit him in russia. our collaboration on the present subject
was entirely by e-mail. our last encouter in person was in cambridge (uk) at the beginning
of march 1997. at that time i thought as a matter of course that we would meet soon again,
but this is not so! in the large number of email messages we exchanged since then, it is clear
that he was under a great pressure, but yet he was always coming up with exciting ideas,
calculations and so on.

my other regret is that, although we were very good friends, we seldom had time to so-
cialise outside research. i will always remember these few very warm and friendly encounters,
and especially when his svetlanas (as he used to say) were present.

m. saveliev was great both as a scientist and as a human being. he was obviously such

a good father, husband, friend!

in recent times we turned[1] to the classical integration of theories in more than two
dimensions with local extended supersymmetries. our motivation was twofold. on the one
hand this problem is very important for the recent developments in duality and m the-
ory. on the other hand, the recent advances initiated by seiberg and witten indicate that
these theories are in many ways higher dimensional analogues of two dimensional confor-
mal/integrable systems, so that progress may be expected. since fall 1997, we have studied
super yang-mills theories in ten dimensions. there, it was shown by witten[3] that the eld
equations are equivalent to atness conditions. this is a priori similar to well known basic
ones of toda theories, albeit no real progress could be made at that time, since the corre-
sponding lax type equations involve an arbitrary light like vector which plays the role of a
spectral parameter. at rst, we reformulated the eld equations in a way which is similar
to a super version of the higher dimensional generalisations of toda theories developed by
razumov and saveliev[2], where the yang-mills gauge algebra is extended to a super one.
this has not yet been published since, contrary to our initial hope, the two types of theories
do not seem to be equivalent.
i hope to return to this problem in a near future. in the
mean time, we found the existence of an on-shell gauge, in super yang-mills where the eld

1

equations simplify tremendously and where the rst similarity with self-dual yang-mills in
four dimensions came out[1]. this directly led to the present progress.

as is well known, super yang-mills theories in ten dimensions just describes a standard
non abelian gauge eld coupled with a charged majorana-weyl spinor eld in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group. the dynamics is thus specied by the standard action

s = z d10x tr(cid:26)

(cid:16)mm + [xm, ](cid:17)(cid:27) ,

ymn = mxn  nxm + [xm, xn] .

(1.1)

(1.2)

the notations are as follows3: xm(x) is the vector potential, (x) is the majorana-weyl
spinor. both are matrices in the adjoint representation of the gauge group g. latin indices
m = 0, . . . 9 describe minkowski components. greek indices  = 1, . . . 16 denote chiral spinor
components. we will use the superspace formulation with odd coordinates . the super
vector potentials, which are valued in the gauge group, are noted am (x, ), a (x, ). as
shown in refs. [3], [4], we may remove all the additional elds and uniquely reconstruct the
physical elds xm,  from am and a if we impose the condition a = 0 on the latter.

with this condition, it was shown in refs. [3], [4], that the eld equations derived from

the lagrangian 1.1 are equivalent to the atness conditions

where f is the supercovariant curvature

f=0,

f = da + da + [a, a] + 2 (m) am.

d denote the superderivatives

and we use the dirac matrices

m =

d =   (m) m,

throughout the paper, it will be convenient to use the following particular realisation:

088

(cid:18)(cid:16)9(cid:17)(cid:19) = (cid:18)(cid:16)9(cid:17)(cid:19) =   188 088

the convention for greek letters is as follows: letters from the beginning of the alphabet run
from 1 to 16. letters from the middle of alphabet run from 1 to 8. in this way, we shall sep-
arate the two spinor representations of o(8) by rewriting 1, . . . , 16 as 1, . . . , 8, 1, . . . , 8

using the above explicit realisations on sees that the equations to solve take the form

f  da + da + [a, a]+ = 2 (a0 + a9)

f  da + da + [a, a]+ = 2 (a0  a9)

f  da + da + [a, a]+ = 2

(1.12)

in my last paper with m. saveliev [1], these atness conditions in superspace were used to go
to an on-shell light-cone gauge where half of the superelds vanish. after reduction to (1+1)
dimensions, the non-linear part of the equations was transformed into equations for a scalar
supereld which are (super) analogues of the so called yang equations which were much
studied in connection with solutions of self-dual yang-mills equations in four dimensions.
the main dierences between the two type of relations is that derivatives are now replaced
by superderivatives, that there are sixteen equations instead of four, and that the indices are
paired dierently. nevertheless, it was found that these novel features are precisely such that
the equations may be solved by methods very similar to the ones developed in connection
with self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions. the aim of the present paper is to push this
analogy much further, by deriving the analogues of the lax pair of belavin zakharov[5]
which was instrumental for deriving multi-instanton solutions at the end of the seventies.

2 the lax representation

the original theory is o(9, 1) invariant, but the choice of dirac matrices just summarized is
covariant only under a particular o(8) subgroup. the lax reprsentation will come out after
picking up a particular o(7) subgroup of the latter. this done simply by remarking that we
may choose one i to be the unit matrix, in which case the others are antisymmetric and
obey the o(7) dirac algebra. this is so, for instance in the following explicit representation
of the o(8) gamma matrices, where 8 is equal to one, which we will use throughout:

1 = 1  31  1
2 = 1  1  31
3 = 31  1  1

5 = 3  31  1

6 = 1  3  31

7 = 31  1  3

4 = 31  31  31

8 = 1  1  1.

(2.1)

with this choice, it follows from equations 1.101.12 that

f = 2 (a0 + ag) , f = 2 (a0  ag) , f + f = 4a8.

(2.2)

3

we have symmetrized the mixed (last) equations so that the right-hand sides only involve
kronecker deltas in the spinor indices. by taking 8 to be the unit matrix, we have intro-
duced a mapping between overlined and non overlined indices. accordingly, in the previous
equation and hereafter, whenever we write an overlined index and non overlined one with
the same letter (such as  and ) we mean that they are numerically equal, so that 8
 = 1.
next, in parallel with what was done for self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions, it is con-
venient to go to complex (super) coordinates. thus we introduce, with i the square root of
minus one4,

g = f  f + if + if

g = f  f  if  if,

g = f + f + if  if,

 = d + id,  = d  id,

b = a + ia, b = a  ia.

a straightforward computation shows that

[, ]+ = 4 (9  i8) ,

[, ]+ = 4 (9 + i8) ,

[, ]+ + [, ]+ = 80

consider, now the system of dierential equations

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

d ()  ( +  + b + b) () = 0,  = 1, . . . , 8.

(2.7)

of course, although we do not write it for simplicity of notations, () is a supereld function
of x and . the parameter  is an arbitrary complex number. the consistency condition of
these equations is

[d, d]+ () = 0.

(2.8)

this gives

{4 (9  i8) + g}  +  {80 + g + g} 

+2 {4 (9 + i8) + g}  = 0.

thus we correctly get that, for  6= 

g = g = g + g = 0,

and that g g, g do not depend upon . thus these consistency conditions are
equivalent to the symmetrized dynamical equations 2.2.

4for the new symbols, the group theoretical meaning of the fermionic indices   is lost. we adopt this

convention to avoid clusy notations.

4

3 hermiticity conditions for superelds:

we take the gauge group to be su(n). then the physical elds xm and  are anti-
hermitian matrices. at this point, we need to derive the associated hermiticity conditions
for our superelds am, a. consider, in general a supereld

then

f (x, ) =

one may verify that the superelds am, a have decomposition of the type 3.1 with f [p]
1...p =
f [p]
 = kf akf . next consider
the eect of the superderivative operator. the action on the pth component of a supereld
3.1 is given by

since the matrix m are real, we immediately get

d(cid:16)kbf 

b kb(cid:17) = kf (dfb) kf , d(cid:16)kbf 

f kb(cid:17) = kf (dff ) kf

(3.5)

the last equations are of course consistent with the fact that the superderivatives transform
a bosonic supereld into a fermionic one and vice versa. at this time, the fact that a and
its superderivatives satisfy dierent hermiticity conditions leads to complications which we
will avoid by only looking at solutions such that  = 0. for these purely bosonic solutions

5

, 1,...2p = 0 and a[2p+1]

a[2p]
choose, instead of the above,

m, 1,...2p+1 = 0. all supereld components are commuting, and we may

kb = kf = k = (1)r(r1)/2 .

(3.6)

then, it is easy to show that () and (cid:16)k(1/)k(cid:17)1

we shall assume that

satisfy the same equation. thus

() = k1(1/)k

(3.7)

4 the two pole ansatz

as for self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions, we assume that  is a meromorphic function
of . condition 3.7 shows that poles appear in pairs. the simplest ansatz involve two poles.
the following displays the corresponding solution, for the gauge group su(2), following the
line of ref[5] rather closely. taking the poles at zero and  we write the ansatz

() =  u1 + f a 
1() =  u1  f a +

f a
 !
f a
 !

where

a =

1

aa + bb   ab

b2 ab ! .

(4.1)

(4.2)

in these denitions u, f , a, b are superelds. in agreement with equations 3.6, we introduce
the notation

for any (matrix valued or not) supereld. it is easy to see that

the equations just written are such that the denitions 4.1 are consistent with equation 3.7,
and with the relation ()1() = 1, provided we assume that

next, we derive algebraic equations for the superelds appearing in the ansatz, by rewriting
equation 2.7 as

u2 = 1  f f .

(4.5)

identifying the powers in  gives the following set of independent equations

b + b = () ( + ) 1().

f a(cid:16) f a(cid:17) = 0
f au  u(cid:16) f a(cid:17)  f a(cid:16) f a(cid:17) = 0

u1u + f au + f a (f a)  u(cid:16) f a(cid:17) + f a(cid:16) f a(cid:17) = b,

f = kf k

(4.3)

(4.4)

together with three more relations deduced from the above according to equation 3.7. at
this point it is useful to write

1

a =

aa + bb

since the matrix  is such that 2 = 0. equation 4.7 is satised i

equation 4.8 may be transformed into

a = b = 0.

where we have let

equation 4.8 is satised if we have

g =  

g = u

g = h,

h = ba  ab.

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

remarkably, equation 4.11 is a particular case of equations which already appeared in ref[1]
where general solutions were obtained which are only dependent upon x0 and x9. we shall
obtain solutions of equations 4.13 below. once these two equations are solved, equation 4.9
allows to derive the vector potentials. for this it is convenient to rewrite it under the form

b =

(4.14)

5 a particular solution

at this preliminary stage, and in order to arrive at a concrete solution, we choose a simple
particular ansatz. we only retain dependence in x0  t and x9  x. a simple linear solution
of equations 4.11 is

a = 1,

b = t + ix

,

a = 0, b = 2db = (cid:16) + i(cid:17)

aa + bb = b + b = 2t.

so that

then equation 4.13 gives

(5.1)

g = 8x + c

(5.2)

where c = 0. we will simply choose c to be a constant. using equations 4.5, 4.12, we
obtain

u = vuut

6 outlook

it seems clear that the symmetrised system of equations 2.2 is completely and explicitly inte-
grable much like self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions. note that, in the gauge introduced
in ref.[1] where a = 0, the right most equations 2.2 give da + da = 0, for  6= .
this is precisely the condition which was used in ref[1] to let a = d. in other words, the
present lax pair is equivalent to the set of equations which was previously solved in ref.[1].

concerning the full yang-mills equations or equivalently the unsymmetrised equations
1.101.12, any solution is also a solution of the symmetrised equations 2.2. thus we should
be able to derive solutions of the latter which are general enough so that we may impose
that they be solutions of the former. this problem is currently under investigation.
