abstract.

we consider the cosmology of a 3-brane universe in a ve dimensional (bulk)
space-time with a cosmological constant. we show that einsteins equations
admit a rst integral, analogous to the rst friedmann equation, which governs
the evolution of the metric in the brane, whatever the time evolution of the
metric along the fth dimension. we thus obtain the cosmological evolution in
the brane for any equation of state describing the matter in the brane, without
needing the dependence of the metric on the fth dimension. in the particular
case p = w, (w = constant), we give explicit expressions for the time evolution
of the brane scale factor, which show that standard cosmological evolution can be
obtained (after an early non conventional phase) in a scenario `a la randall and
sundrum, where a brane tension compensates the bulk cosmological constant.
we also show that a tiny deviation from exact compensation leads to an eective
cosmological constant at late time. moreover, when the metric along the fth
dimension is static, we are able to extend the solution found on the brane to the
whole spacetime.

1 introduction

there has been recently a lot of activity on the possibility that we live in a three-
dimensional world embedded in a higher dimensional space. modifying the old
kaluza-klein picture [1], where the extra-dimensions must be suciently com-
pact, these recent developpements are based on the idea that ordinary matter
elds could be conned to a three-dimensional world, corresponding to our ap-
parent universe, while gravity could live in a higher dimensional space [2]. the
usual constraints on kaluza-klein models could therefore be relaxed [3], and
large extra-dimensions would be conceivable, thus leading to a fundamental
planck mass much lower than its apparent three-dimensional value, even as low
as the t ev scale. in the same spirit, randall and sundrum [4],[5], reviving an
older idea [6], have recently pointed out that the extra dimension (single in their
case) need not even be compact.

these ideas have raised a lot of interest and several groups have begun to
work on possible experimental signatures of these kinds of models. although
less directly, one would expect that cosmology as well could provide a lot of
interesting constraints on these types of models. the rst crucial question is
the viability of such models with respect to the cosmological evolution of our
universe. in a previous paper [7], three of us have shown that, generically, the
equations governing the cosmological evolution of the brane will be dierent from
the analogous friedmann equations of standard cosmology (the same holds for a
brane with nite thickness [8]). essentially, the dierence lies in the fact that the
energy density of the brane appears quadratically in the new friedmann equations
in constrast with the linear behaviour of the usual equations.
in the simplest
model where the bulk is supposed to be empty (and stabilized), we found explicit
solutions which showed that the corresponding cosmological scenario would be
incompatible with nucleosynthesis constraints.

following our work, it was noticed by two groups ([9],[10]) that a possible way
to reconcile brane cosmology with the required standard cosmological scenario (at
least since nucleosynthesis) would be to use randall and sundrums approach [5],
i.e. to put a (negative) cosmological constant in the bulk and to introduce in the
brane, in addition to ordinary matter, a constant tension that would exactly
compensate the bulk cosmological constant so that the, quadratic, leading order
due to the brane contribution would be cancelled, leaving the next, linear, order.
these works however only provided an approximate perturbative analysis of
the cosmological evolution. now, exact solutions of the global einsteins equa-
tions are extremely useful, and until now, such solutions with a bulk cosmological
constant exist only when the spacetime is static ([4]), or in the extensions given
by kaloper [11] (see also [12]), where the brane tension does not exactly com-
pensate the bulk cosmological constant, so that dynamical evolution is possible,
but in the simplest form of exponential expansion. some other exact solutions
are also known for more complicated bulk (see e.g.[13] for static and non static

2

solutions in the framework of horava-witten supergravity, general conditions for
static universes can be found in [14]).

the purpose of the present work is to solve the ve-dimensional einsteins
equations for any type of matter in the brane with a cosmological constant in the
bulk. we rst show in section 2 that einsteins equations admit a rst integral,
which in particular provides directly the cosmological evolution of the brane. in
the following section, we show that an additional assumption, namely that the
metric along the fth dimension does not evolve in time, enables us to solve for
the whole space-time metric, i.e. to nd explicitly the dependence of the metric
on the transverse coordinate as well as time. finally, in the last section, we
solve analytically, for dierent cases, the new friedmann equation obtained in
the present work and discuss the consequences.

2 solving einsteins equations

let us present here the general framework. we shall consider ve-dimensional
spacetime metrics of the form

ds2 = gabdxadxb = gdxdx + b2dy2,

(1)

where y is the coordinate of the fth dimension. throughout this article, we will
focus our attention on the hypersurface dened by y = 0, which we identify with
the world volume of the brane that forms our universe. since we are interested
in cosmological solutions, we take a metric of the form

ds2 = n2(, y)d 2 + a2(, y)ijdxidxj + b2(, y)dy2,

(2)

where ij

is a maximally symmetric 3-dimensional metric (k = 1, 0, 1 will

the ve-dimensional einstein equations take the usual form

(3)

where rab is the ve-dimensional ricci tensor and r = gab rab the scalar
curvature and the constant  is related to the ve-dimensional newtons constant
g(5) and the ve-dimensional reduced planck mass m(5), by the relations

2 = 8g(5) = m 3

in the above expressions, a prime stands for a derivative with respect to y, and
a dot for a derivative with respect to  .

the stress-energy-momentum tensor can be decomposed into two parts,

t a

b = t a

b|bulk + t a

b|brane,

(9)

where t a
assumed in the present work to be of the form

b|bulk is the energy momentum tensor of the bulk matter, which will be

t a

b|bulk = diag (b, pb, pb, pb, pt ) ,

(10)

where the energy density b and pressures pb and pt are independent of the
coordinate y. later, we will be specially interested in the case of a cosmological
constant for which b = pb = pt .
b|brane corresponds to the matter content in the brane
(y = 0). since we consider here only strictly homogeneous and isotropic geome-
tries inside the brane, the latter can be expressed quite generally in the form

the second term t a

t a

b|brane =

(y)

b

diag (b, pb, pb, pb, 0) ,

(11)

where the energy density b and pressure pb are independent of the position inside
the brane, i.e. are functions only of time. we may also add some other brane
sources with similar energy momentum tensor.

the assumption that t05 = 0, which physically means that there is no ow
of matter along the fth dimension, implies that g05 vanishes.
it then turns
out, remarkably, that the components (0, 0) and (5, 5) of einsteins equations
(3),(with (5) and (8)), in the bulk, can be rewritten in the simple form

f  =

where c is a constant of integration which a priori depends on time. assuming
in addition that t 0
5, one nds using the time derivative of (12) and
the yderivative of (13) that b is constant in time. this also implies that c is
constant in time. in order to deal with the last component of einsteins equations
(see (6)), it is convenient to use the bianchi identity,

0 = t 5

a ga0 = 0,
which can be rewritten (using g05 = 0, and t 0

(17)

one nds (using (12)) that this equation is identically satised if b = pb.
hence, when the bulk source is a cosmological constant, any set of functions a,
n, and b satisfying (15) or, more explicitly,

(18)

together with g05 = 0, will be solution of all einsteins equations (3), locally in
the bulk.

the brane can then be taken into account by using the junction conditions
[15], which simply relate the jumps of the derivative of the metric across the brane
to the stress-energy tensor inside the brane. this procedure is described in detail
in our previous paper [7] in the context of ve-dimensional brane cosmology (see
also [16]). the relevant expressions are

(20)

where the subscript 0 for a, b, n means that these functions are taken in y = 0,
and [q] = q(0+)  q(0) denotes the jump of the function q across y = 0.
assuming the symmetry y  y for simplicity, the junction condition (19)
can be used to compute a on the two sides of the brane, and by continuity when
y  0, (18) will yield the generalized (rst) friedmann equation (after setting
n0 = 1 by a suitable change of time):

the salient features of this equation are that, rst, the bulk energy density enters
linearly, second, the brane energy density enters quadratically, and nally the
cosmological evolution depends on a free parameter c (related to the choice of
initial conditions in the whole space-time), whose inuence corresponds to an
eective radiation term (from the standard point of view, i.e. interpreting linearly
the additional term)2. one can note that this equation is a generalization of the
exact equation obtained in our previous paper [7]. this equation is enough to
study the cosmological evolution in the brane, independently of the metric outside
and in particular of the time evolution of b. the analysis of this equation will be
postponed until section 4. in the next section we will be interested in obtaining
an explicit solution for the whole ve dimensional metric.

3 explicit dependence on the fth dimension

for a stabilized bulk

in this section, it will be shown that, with the help of an additional assumption,
namely that the fth dimension is static, in the sense that

b = 0,

(22)

it is then possible to solve the full space-time metric, i.e. to determine the explicit
dependence of the metric on the coordinate y. the restriction (22) allows us to
go to the gauge

(23)
it then follows immediately from equation g05 = 0, that n can be expressed in
terms of a according to the relation

b = 1.

a
n

= (t),

(24)

where  is a function that depends only on time (and not on y). inserting this
into (12) yields the following dierential equation:

2 + k  (aa) =

ba2,

(25)

which is valid everywhere in the bulk (but not in the brane) on the two sides of
the brane separately. it can be integrated in y, yielding

a2 = a cosh(y) + b sinh(y) + c,

(26)

2from a technical point of view, the presence of a free parameter, in contrast to the standard
cosmological equations, can be explained in the following way. in four-dimensional cosmology,
the component (0,0) of einsteins equations yields a rst integral, because it contains only rst
derivatives in time. in the present work, we have used the component (0,0) to integrate in y,
whereas the time integration is operated with the help of the component (5,5) which contains
second derivatives in time.

terms of  as

and the others can be determined by the junction conditions. the symmetry

let us nally x our temporal gauge, by imposing the condition n0 = 1, i.e.
we choose as time what corresponds to the cosmic time in the brane. the function
 is then simply a0 (see equation (24)), and (26) specialized to y = 0 gives

(36)

substituting back the coecients a and b thus obtained in the general expression
(26) and using (21), one nally obtains the following expression for the scale factor

(37)

the other coecient of the metric, n(t, y), follows directly from the above ex-
pression with the help of the relation (24), i.e.

n(t, y) =

a(t, y)
a0(t)

.

(38)

therefore, from the two functions a0(t) and b(t) restricted to the brane, which
are obtainable by solving the coupled system constituted of the two equations
(21) and (33), one is able to infer the extension of the metric in the bulk away
from the brane.

let us mention briey the case b = 0. following the same procedure as

above, one would end up with the following expression for the scale factor:

a(t, y) = (a2

(39)

in the special case c = 0, one recognizes the linear solutions obtained in our
previous paper [7].
we have not specied here whether the fth dimension is compact or not. if
it is compact, then one must check that one gets in the end a globally well dened
solution (see [7]).

the next section will be devoted to the determination of the evolution of the
scale factor on the brane, a0(t), using equations (21) and (33), which - we wish
to emphasize - does not depend on the hypothesis (22) of the present section.

4 cosmological scenarios

in this section we will examine the consequences of equation (21) on the cos-
mological evolution inside the brane.
in general, one still nds the quadratic

8

behaviour in the brane energy density which leads to a non conventional cosmol-
ogy [7]. however, as suggested by [9] and [10], we will show that one can indeed
implement the idea of randall and sundrum [5] in the cosmological context to
recover standard cosmology. we will nd exact solutions that match the early
non conventional cosmology to the subsequent ordinary cosmology.

let us thus assume that the energy density in the brane can be decomposed

into two parts,

b =  + ,

(40)

where  is a constant that represents an intrinsic tension of the brane and 
stands for the ordinary energy density in cosmology. substituting in (21) one
gets

when   . let us however keep  unspecied at this stage. in the case  = 0
and c = 0 one would recover the solutions given by kaloper [11].
to get analytic solutions we will now assume that ordinary matter is described
by an equation of state of the form p = w, with w constant. then, using equation
(33) for  and p, one can write

 = (a0/a)q,

q = 3(1 + w),

(44)

where  and a are constants. inserting this expression in (41), it is possible to
integrate explicitly the resulting equation in the case where c = 0 and k = 0.

(the origin of time being chosen so that a0(0) = 0). it is clear, from the latter
expression, in the case  = 0, how one passes from a very early universe, charac-
terized by a non-conventional evolution a(t)  t1/q, to a late time phase described
by standard cosmology, a(t)  t2/q. in the case  > 0, with  suciently small,
one obtains three successive phases, a non-conventional phase dominated by 2,
a conventional phase dominated by  and, nally, an exponential phase, where
 plays the role of an eective cosmological constant in our universe. therefore,
brane cosmology is able to produce a late time acceleration phase such as seems
to be needed from the latest cosmological observations ([17]), at the price how-
ever of a tiny mismatch in the compensation between b and the tension of the
brane. the required ne-tuning expresses the brane cosmological version of the
well-known cosmological constant problem.

let us nally examine the case of a universe lled with radiation (w = 1/3).
it is then possible, still with k = 0, to integrate explicitly the case c 6= 0, because
the c-term has the same dependence on a0 as the term proportional to  in (41).
moreover, the free parameter c can be constrained by nucleosynthesis. indeed,
at the time of nucleosynthesis, the universe is dominated by the radiation energy
density, which can be written

rad(tn ) = g

2
30

t 4
n ,

(48)

where g is the eective number of relativistic degrees of freedom at that time.
in the standard model, g(standard) = 10.75, and any deviation g is strongly
constrained by the observed abundances of light elements, typically g < 2.
in our model, since the additional c-term evolves like radiation, it can also be
seen eectively as additional relativistic degrees of freedom, subject to the usual
constraint, so that

to conclude, we wish to recall the main results of this work. first, it has
been shown that one can obtain a rst integral of einsteins equations, which
provides, on the brane, a relation analogous to the (rst) friedmann equation
and which depends only on the geometry and matter content of the brane, except
for a constant parameter. second, when b = 0, one can extend explicitly the
solution found on the brane to the whole spacetime. finally, we have shown, ex-
hibiting exact solutions, that brane cosmology appears compatible, at late times,
with standard cosmology, in a randall-sundrum type model. in this respect, an
important question for future investigations is wether an (exact or quasi) randall-
sundrum conguration can be naturally reached in a dynamical scenario for the
very early universe.
