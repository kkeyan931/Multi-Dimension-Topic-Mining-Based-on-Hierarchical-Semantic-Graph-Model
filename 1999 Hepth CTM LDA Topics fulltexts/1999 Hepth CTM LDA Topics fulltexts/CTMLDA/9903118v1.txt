abstract

in this paper, we use only the equation of motion for an interact-
ing system of gravity, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor to study the
soliton solutions by making use of a poincare invariant ansatz. we
show that the system of equations are completly integrable and the
solution is unique with appropriate boundary conditions. some new
class of solutions are also given explicitly.

1 introduction

superstring theory [1, 2] was the leading candidate for a theory unifying all
matter and forces (including gravity, in particular). unfortunately, there are
ve such consistent theories, namely, so(32) type i , type iia, type iib,
e8  e8 heterotic and spin(32)/z2 heterotic theories. this richness is an
embarrassment for pure theorists. one hope is that all these ve superstring
theories are just dierent solutions of an underlying theory. in the last few
years this hope turns out to be true. the underlying theory is the so called

m theory [3, 4, 5]. one formulation of m theory is given in terms of matrix
theory [6]. nevertheless this formulation is not background independent. it
is dicult to use it to discuss non-perturbative problems and still we should
rely on the study of bps states. a through study of bps states in any theory
is a must for an understanding of non-perturbative phenomena.

in superstring theory and m theory, there is a plethora of bps states.
these bps states have the special property of preserving some supersymme-
try. in a low energy limit they are special solutions of the low energy su-
pergravity theory with poincare invariance. however there exists also some
other p-branes which dont preserve any supersymmetry and they are also
no longer poincare invariant. in nding these (soliton) solutions one either
resort to supersymmetry or make some simple plausible assumptions. there
is no denite reasoning that the so obtained solution is unique. the purpose
of this paper is to ll this gap.

it is also interesting to study soliton solutions for its own sake without
using any supersymmetric argument. quite recently there are some interests
[7, 8, 9, 10] in studying branes in type 0 string theories which have no fermions
and no supersymmetry in 10 dimensions [2]. in these string theories, we cant
use supersymmetric arguments. so it is important to push other symmtric
arguments to their limits.

in this paper we will study the coupled system of gravity (gm n ), dilaton
() and anti-symmetric (am1m2mn1) tensor in any dimensions. after mak-
ing a poincare invariant ansatz for the metric and either electric or magnetic
ansatz for the anti-symmetric tensor, we derive all the equations of motion in
some details. a system of ve ordinary dierential equations are obtained for
four unknown functions (of one variable). after making some changes of the
unknown functions we solved three equations explicity. we show that the re-
maining two equations (for one unknown functions) are mutually compatible
and a unique solution can always obtained with appropriate boundary con-
ditions. to solve the last equation in the most generic case is surely beyond
our ability because this last equation is a riccati equation which is known to
be not solvable by algebric means. instead we will discuss some degenerate
cases and recover many known solution in the literature. some new solutions
are also found and their physical property will be discussed elsewhere [16].
for previous studies of soliton and brane solution in supergravity and string
theories, see for example the reviews [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

the extension of the result of this paper to black branes will appear in
another publication [17]. we remark that this paper contains some unneces-

2

sary computational details from some experts point of view. although some
formulas are not new (but scattered in various places), we still think that
they are necessary for an understanding of our logic.

2 the equations of motion and the ansatz

our starting point is the following action for the coupled system of gravity
gm n , dilaton  and anti-symmetric tensor am1mn1:

i =z ddxg (cid:18)r 

1
2

gm n m n  

1
2  n!

ea f 2(cid:19) ,

(1)

where a is a constant and f is the eld strength: f = da. an overall
proportional constant for the action i is irrelevant for what follows.

the equations of motion can be easily derived from the above action (1):

rm n =

m n  + sm n ,

1
2

m1(g eaf m1m2mn) = 0,
m (ggm n n ) =

a
2n!

ea f 2,

where

sm n =

2(n  1)!

ea (cid:18)fm m2mnf m2mn

n



n  1
n(d  2)

f 2gm n(cid:19) .

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

of course it is impossible to solve the above system equations in their full
generality. to get some meaningful solution we will make some assumptions
by using symmetric arguments.

our ansatz for a p-dimensional brane is as follows:

ds2 = e2a(r)(dt2 +

p

x=1

(dx)2) + e2b(r)dr2 + e2c(r)d d+1,

(6)

where d d+1 is the square of the line element on the unit d + 1 sphere which
can be written as follows (d = p + d + 3):

d d+1 = d2

1 + sin2 1d2

2 +    + (sin 1    sin  d)2d2

d+1.

(7)

3

the brane is extended in the directions (t, x). the ansatz (6) is poincare
invariant in these directions. for our later use in [17] we will give the formulas
for the more general ansatz:

ds2 = e2a(r)dt2 +

p

x=1

e2a(r)(dx)2 + e2b(r)dr2 + e2c(r)d d+1.

(8)

we also note here that there is still some freedom to choose the parametriza-
tion r. this freedom can be xed by making either the choice c(r) = ln r or
c(r) = b(r) + ln r.

for the anti-symmetric tensor a, we have 2 dierent choices. the rst

choice is the electric case where we take the following form for a (x0 = t):

a = e(r) dx0  dx1      dxp.

(9)

this xes p = n  2. the second choice is the magnetic case where we take
the following form for the dual potential a:

a = e(r) dx0  dx1      dxp,

(10)

and p = d  n  2. we note that the relation between the antisymmetric
tensor eld strength f and its dual eld strength f ( d a) is:

f m1mn =

ea

1

g

1

(d  n)!

m1mnn1ndn fn1ndn.

(11)

by using this relation the ansatz (10) transform to an ansatz for f :

f = exp(  a  a 

p

x=1

a  b + ( d + 1)c)  d+1,

(12)

where  d+1 is the volume form of the sphere s d+1 with unit radius. as it
is well-known from duality, the equation of motion (3) becomes the bianchi
identity for f which is satised automatically. nevertheless the bianchih
identity for f becomes the equation of motion for f which is given as follows:

n1(g ea f n1n2ndn) = 0.

g

(13)

from now on we will discuss the electric case only.

we will compute the riemann curvature by using the vilebein formalism.
the coordinate index is denoted as (m) = (t, , r, i) and tangent index is
denoted as (a) = (t, , r,i), i.e. a bar over coordinate index. the moving
frame is:

et = ea(r) dt = et,
e  = ea(r) dx = e ,
er = eb(r) dr = er,
ei = ec(r) sin 1    sin i1di = ei.

by using the dening equation of ab:

we obtain the following expression for ab:

dea + ab  eb = 0,

 eabdy = a

tr = a eabdt = a eb et,
 r = a
ir = c  ecb sin 1    sin i1di = c  eb ei,
ij = cos j sin j+1    sin i1di,

 eb e,

i > j.

the other components are zero or can be obtained from the above by using
the anti-symmetric property of ab: ab = ba.

from ab we can compute rab:

the results are:

rab = dab + ac  cddb.

rt  = aa

rtr = (aeab) eab et  er,
rti = ac  e2b et  ei,

by making use of fact that the metric in (6) is a diagonal metric we have

(56)

(57)

and the equation derived from the equation of motion for f is

((r) e(r)+a(r)da(r)+ db(r) r

d+1) = 0.

these ve equations, eqs. (53)-(55), (56) and (57), consist of the complete
system of equations of motion for four unknow functions: a(r), b(r), (r)
and (r). we will discuss these equations in the next two sections.

3 the solvability of the equations

in this section we will try to solve the system of the above ve equations.
first it is easy to integrate eq. (57) to get

(r) e(r)+a(r)da(r)+ db(r) r

d+1 = c0,

(58)

where c0 is a constant of integration. if we know the other three functions
a(r), b(r) and (r), this equation can be easily integrated to give (r):

e(r) = c0 z r

dr

ea(r)+da(r) db(r)

r d+1

.

(59)

by using eq. (58), s can be written as

s(r) = c0

2 (r) db(r)

e a

r d+1

.

(60)

now we make a change of functions from a(r), b(r) and (r) to (r),

(r) and y (r):

(r) = da(r) + db(r),
(r) = (r) + a(a(r)  b(r)),
y (r) = a(r)  b(r),

the general solutions for  and  can be obtained easily from eqs. (67)

and (68) and we have

 =

(72)

(73)

where c1, c2 and c3 are constants of integration. to make sense of the
above expressions, c1 and c2 cant be zero simultaneously. for c1 6= 0 we
can always choose c1 = 1 by a rescaling of t and x.

substituting the above expressions into eqs. (69) and (70), we obtain

y

k = c 2

3 (  a2) + 8c1c2 d( d + 1),

from eq. (75) we see that if k  0, there is no restriction for the interval
of r. if the constant k < 0, r can only take such values that where s2 > 0.
notice that our system of equations of motion is an over determined
four unknown functions satisfying ve equations. we have solved
system:
three equations and there are two equations, eqs. (74) and (75), remaining
with one unknown functions y (r). now we would like to show that these two
equations actually give no constraints on y (r) and eectively there is only
one equation, i.e., we can solve either one of them and the other one will be
satised automatically.

because this proof is a rather involved algebraic calculation which we did
it by using mathematica using computer, we will only give the steps of the
proof.

first we change eq.

(75) by taking the logarithm of both sides. the
logarithm of s can be rewritten as a function of y ,  and  by using eq.
(60). now we dierentiate both sides with respect to r to eliminate c0.
substituting  and  with the explicit results given in eqs. (72) and (73) we
obtain an equation containing only the unknow function y and its rst and
second derivatives y  and y .

in the second step we eliminate y  by using eq. (74). we found that the
remaining equation involving y and y  is just an identity1. this completes
our proof that eq. (74) and eq. (75) are compatible and we can use either
one to solve for y . it seems that eq. (74) is more suitable for solving y .

1 otherwise we would obtain an equation containing y and y  only. it could be used

to solve y .

10

now we start to solve equation (74). by a change of function from y to

y:

eq. (74) becomes

y = y

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

it is well-known that the above ricatti equation cant be solved alge-
braically for generic r(r). if we know any special solution to (80), a general
construction could be used to nd the geneal solution to eq. (74). denoting
the special solution to (80) by y0(r), the general solution to eq. (74) is given
as follows:

discussed in [16]. so we set c2 = 0, and c1 = c4 = 1 by a conventional
choice of scale. the solution simplies to:

so far we have discussed all the possible solutions when either c1 or c2 is
zero. when none of them is zero, things become more complicated. the
interested reader can nd more special cases in [16] not discussed here.
