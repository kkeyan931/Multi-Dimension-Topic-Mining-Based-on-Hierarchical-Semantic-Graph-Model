abstract

the question of how infalling matter in a pure state forms

a schwarzschild black hole that appears to be at non-zero temperature
is discussed in the context of the ads/cft connection. it is argued
that the phenomenon of self-thermalization in non-linear (chaotic) sys-
tems can be invoked to explain how the boundary theory, initially at
zero temperature self thermalizes and acquires a nite temperature.
yang-mills theory is known to be chaotic (classically) and the imagi-
nary part of the gluon self-energy (damping rate of the gluon plasma)
is expected to give the lyapunov exponent. we explain how the imag-
inary part would arise in the corresponding supergravity calculation
due to absorption at the horizon of the black hole.

1 introduction

ever since the discovery by bekenstein and hawking that black holes have a
temperature associated with them there has been a puzzling question. when
infalling matter in a pure quantum state collapse into a black hole, how does
it become a mixed state, which a schwarzschild black hole with a nite
hawking temperature must needs be? one possible answer is that quantum
mechanics in the presence of gravity is not unitary. another is that the
state is actually pure and only appears mixed to the outside observer. in
this paper we wish to dwell not on this question but rather on a related
simpler question: why does the state appear thermal to the outside observer
(regardless of whether it is actually pure or mixed)? this second question in
some sense can be phrased in an operational manner since a thermal state
(in the thermodynamic sense of the word) can be dened to be one which for
instance has a thermal (maxwell-boltzmann, bose-einstein or fermi-dirac)
distribution of particles. or it can be dened as a system that looks ergodic.
chaotic systems typically become ergodic on a time scale given by the
(inverse of the) lyapunov exponent. thus it is possible for a non-thermal
state to become thermal. therefore an answer to the above question could be
that the system is chaotic. thus we could say that infalling matter initially
in a coherent non thermal state must self thermalize upon collapsing into a
black hole.

of course this problem must be treated quantum mechanically. quan-
tum chaos is less well understood, but if we accept berrys conjecture as a
denition of quantum chaos then it has been shown that this thermalization
takes place quantum mechanically also [1]. in fact these ideas can be used to
dene statistical mechanics without invoking a god-given heat bath [1].

of course it is rather dicult to study self-thermalization in a compli-
cated situation such as black hole formation. the recent connection between
gravity and boundary conformal eld theory [2, 3, 4, 5] allows us to pose
this question in terms of at space yang-mills theory.
it is thus reassur-
ing to know that classical yang-mills exhibits chaos and self thermalization
and that the lyapunov exponent is nothing but the damping rate of hot
gluon plasma. this has been calculated for high temperature qcd [6, 7, 8]
and seems to agree with numerical results on chaos in yang-mills [9].
if
we make the (reasonable) assumption that at high temperatures supersym-
metric yang-mills is qualitatively similar to qcd (at high temperature) the

2

puzzle is resolved: when we add some coherent energy density to a yang
mills vacuum the system thermalizes and becomes ergodic and then one can
associate a temperature t related to the energy density in the usual way
e/v  t 4. in gravity this process corresponds to the formation of a black
hole with a nite hawking temperature. this is an answer to the (simpler)
question posed above at least at a conceptual level. it still remains to actu-
ally calculate this exponent in supergravity. this is similar to the calculation
of the glueball mass using supergravity.

the real part of the self energy in the conning phase, the glueball mass,
in 3+1-qcd was calculated using supergravity [10, 11, 12]. similarly one
can calculate the imaginary part of the self energy in high temperature 3+1-
supersymmetric yang-mills. let us understand the supergravity origin of the
imaginary part. from simple arguments one can show that the eigenvalues
of a schroedinger like operator have imaginary parts when the boundary
conditions are such that the current going into a region is not equal to the
current going out. if we imagine say a (normalizable) solution describing a
dilaton outside the horizon of a black hole, with incoming ux equalling zero
at innity, then, as the dilaton falls into the black hole the ux at the horizon
will be non zero. such a solution must have an imaginary part. it is crucial
here that the boundary condition just outside the horizon is that there are
only ingoing waves. these are complex boundary conditions and that is why
the eigenvalues are complex. in appendix a we give a very brief description
of a one-dimensional quantum mechanical problem that illustrates this point.
in the glueball mass calculation of [5, 10, 11, 12], the boundary condition was
that the derivative vanish at the horizon. this ensures that the eigenvalues
are real. this boundary condition is correct for an equilibrium situation.
another way to see that this is correct is to look at the imaginary time
description of equlibrium statistical mechanics. in this case the horizon is
like the origin of a polar coordinate system and consisitency demands such
a boundary condition. the non-equlibrium situation on the other hand does
not require such a boundary condition. it requires the complex boundary
condition that we described above.

one can then ask - if the complex boundary conditions corresponding
to non-equilibrium are due to absorption by a black hole, how can there
ever be equilibrium in such a situation i.e. how can a dilaton possibly not
be absorbed by a black hole? the answer, obtainable only in a complete
theory, is likely to be that hawking radiation takes care of the emission and

3

in equilibrium absorption and emission must be equal. the imaginary part
is a measure of how fast equilibrium is reached after a small perturbation
disturbs the system. it is equal to the dierence between the two rates. in
equilibrium the imaginary part will be zero.

what does hawking radiation correspond to in yang-mills? as it repre-
sents a ow of energy from small to large radii, it must represent the ow of
energy from long wavelengths to short wavelengths of the yang-mills elds,
as the energy is equipartitioned in reaching thermal equilibrium. this is due
to the same non-linearity of the equations that is also responsible for the
phenomenon of chaos and self thermalization. in thermal equlibrium energy
is uniformly distributed in all modes as demanded by equipartition.

if the above idea is basically correct one can ask further questions, such
as what is the description within yang-mills of the phenomenon of a particles
falling into a black hole. the answer is known [13]: a particle/wave packet
in the bulk starting a distance  >
 0 away from the boundary corresponds in
the boundary to a wave packet of width x  . as the particle in the bulk
falls radially inwards, x increases, by the usual ir/uv duality between the
bulk and the boundary. when the particle reaches the horizon, x reaches
the thermal wavelength.

also, the speed of the infalling particle cannot exceed that of light. this
translates into an upperbound on the rate of wavepacket spreading in the
boundary. this is causality in the bulk, and its manifestations in the bound-
ary theory has been studied in [14].

one can also ask more rened questions such as what happens if the
impact parameter of the bulk particle is suciently large so that the particle
never reaches the horizon. when the impact parameter is non zero, the
particle has angular momentum which is conserved in the bulk, certainly
so in the supergravity approximation used to describe the bulk space time.
thus, as the particle falls inwards, its radial velocity decreases, its angular
velocity increases. if the angular momentum is suciently large, then the
particle will not reach the horizon at all. this would correspond in the
boundary theory to a wave packet that never thermalizes. this is somewhat
counterintuitive.

furthermore, the bulk angular velocity corresponds to the boundary wave
packet momentum pi, in the boundary space time. the bulk angular mo-
mentum conservation should then translate into the boundary theory as the
conservation of the ratio of the wave packet momentum and its size. more-

4

over, as the size increases (bulk particles radial location decreases), the wave
packet momentum increases !
it is not obvious that the boundary theory
(yang-mills theory at nite temeprature) has such an unusual conserved
quantity.

it is in fact quite possible that there is no such conserved quantity.
ads/cft corresondence would then predict that the angular momentum
of the bulk particle is not conserved. this is not such an outrageous predic-
tion. presumably what is happening is that the bulk particle is interacting
with the hawking particles emitted by the black holes, thereby loosing its
angular momentum.
in this situation any particle will fall into the black
hole eventually regardless of its initial angular momentum. while the super-
gravity theory used for the bulk does not know of this eect, the boundary
theory somehow knows about this and is predicting its eect. one would
expect that if the supergravity equations are corrected to include self inter-
action of dilatons, equivalently the back reaction of hawking photons, this
eect would be seen.

regardless of whether one neglects the drag eect of the heat bath or
not, one thing is clear from the above. if the wavepacket has a large value
of the boundary momentum pi it will take longer to thermalize.
it turns
out that this is seen in numerical simulations for yang-mills - the lyapunov
exponents are found to decrease with pi. thus the supergravity connection
provides an intuitive understanding of this fact.

if the ideas described above are correct one should be able to calculate the
lyapunov exponent for yang-mills using the supergravity connection. one
should then compare with that obtained using nite temperature methods
in qcd. one should of course keep in mind that the latter is computed
in the perturbative regime whereas the supergravity calculation necessarily
describes the strong coupling region. the inverse gluon two point function
at nite temperature has the form (ignoring the index structure):

1() = 2  k2  (),

where () contains the nite temperature corrections to the tree level result.
this is calculated in the imaginary time formalism where  takes values
2int . we can analytically continue  to the real axis and locate the poles
0 + i0. clearly 0  im(0)
. 0 in fact is the damping coecient. on the
supergravity side rather than calculate the propagator, we determine 0 +i0

20

directly by solving the dilaton equation. 1

the computation proceeds as in [5] except for two dierences: one is that
we will assume a real time dependence and solve for the energy eigenvalue
in terms of the momentum. the second is that the boundary condition
will be dierent and will lead to a complex eigenvalue. we will not be
able to evaluate the eigenvalue analytically but we can argue that it will be
complex and also determine the overall scale. the numerical evaluation will
be reported elsewhere.

2 preliminaries

the metric describing an ads5 - schwarzschild black hole space-time is

ds2 = (

( r2

+ r2d2.

= v (r)dt2 +

dr2
v (r)

+ r2d2.

(2.1)

the boundary is at r  . so we let the boundary be at r = r and

assume r is very large. the boundary metric is then

the period of t is

ds2 = 

r2
b2 dt2 + r2d2.

= d 2 + (dxi)2

h =

(2.2)

(2.3)

in the above we have used r+ which is dened by:

v (r) =

1
r2b2 (r2  r2

+)(r2 + r2


)

1the real-time method does not reproduce correctly the imaginary part of the two point
function [15, 16]. nevertheless the location of the pole will be correct. this implies that
the imaginary part of the self energy function which determines the lyapunov exponent
is also correct.

if we let p0 = e, the energy, and l be the angular momentum, these being
conserved, they serve to label the trajectories. the mass shell condition

l2
r2 = e2  u(r).

(3.6)

the quantity u(r) is analogous to a classical potential and is shown in

gure 1 in the case ( gm

b2 )  .

the height of the potential is l2

4gm ). thus whenever e2 exceeds
this the classical particle will fall into the black hole. note also that in the
limit taken in [5] the hump is at innity. so the region being dealt with is to
the left of the hump. in this case all particles fall into the black hole.

the higher terms for large r can be seen to involve higher powers of
thus it is a good approximation for r << b and also far from the turning
point. the turning point r is when e2 = u(r). for r < r the solution is
damped, rather than oscillatory. thus for r << r the eld vanishes. the
ux thus vanishes and the dilaton is not absorbed by the black hole. as
shown in section 5 one can show in such cases that the eigenvalue e is real
and therefore the lyapunov exponent is zero. thus we see as claimed in the
introduction, that in this approximation when the impact parameter is larger
than the black hole radius the lyapunov exponent is zero.

(4.9)

here the dilaton eld has been written as:

(t, r, ) = estf (r)yl()

where l is the angular momentum and  represents all the angles, and s = ie
(with e not necessarily real) species the time dependence. to be precise
we can use the notation

s = i  + .

(4.10)

we will assume that ,  are greater than zero. note that  is the damping
coecient that we want to determine.

we look for normalizable solutions. this equation (4.9) can also be writ-

ten as

(4.13)

the substitution f = (r  r+)pn=n=0 an(r  r+)n into (4.12) gives the
condition 2 = a. thus we can refer to  as the two eigenvalues. we

should also note that if we set the energy parameter s to zero we get degener-
ate solutions. if we let y denote the two solutions, then in the degenerate
limit   0, y+y
is the solution to consider and in fact goes as ln(rr+).
for  6= 0, a certain linear combination of these two y + (, b)y+
is the one that is normalizable at innity. for a given value of  and b
there is a number (, b) (that can be determined numerically) such that
y + (, b)y is normalizable, i.e. the condition of normalizability xes
the functional dependence of  2 on  and b.

in the case at hand we will see below that the boundary condition at the
horizon requires that (, b) = 0. this is an eigenvalue condition and gives
us the energy eigenvalues as a function of b or l. in the limit that gm
b2  ,
l2 can be replaced upto some overall scale by k2 the three momentum squared
[5].

5 boundary conditions and complexity of

eigenvalues

we need to impose some boundary condition to x the parameter  of the
previous section. the boundary can be chosen to be at any value of r,
and the boundary condition should reect some physical requirement. as
explained in the introduction, in [5] the boundary condition was that at
r = r+ the derivative of the dilaton eld vanish. the justication for this is
that in equilibrium one should consider a euclideanized time coordinate  as
is common in nite temperature eld theory. then the point r = r+ is like
the origin of a polar coordinate system in the r   plane. if the eld is to
be well dened the radial derivative must vanish.
in our case we have a non-equilibrium situation. we have a real time
coordinate. so this argument is no longer applicable. the physical problem
we are trying to describe is that of a dilaton outside the black hole falling
into the black hole. a reasonable boundary condition is that just outside
the horizon the eld must be purely ingoing. there cannot be any outgoing
wave at the horizon. this is in accord with physical intuition that says
once a particle reaches the horizon it cannot go out. we will thus impose
this boundary condition at an innitesimal distance  outside the horizon at

2not to be confused with any inverse temperature.

r = r+ + .  is just a regulator that will be set to zero in the end.

let us rst show that the eigenvalues have to be complex. we multiply

by f and integrate equation (4.9) from r = a to r = b to get

subtract from the lhs its complex conjugate. the rst term is manifestly
real and drops out of the dierence. the second term minus its complex
conjugate gives the dierence in ux at the points r = a and r = b. in the
last term only s2 can possibly be complex and so we nally obtain

let us take a =  and b = r+ + . if we have a normalizable function f

the lhs is clearly non-zero. thus s 6= s. this proves that the eigenvalues
are complex.

if one calculates the current 1

dr  c.c.) one nds that near
r = r+ it is proportional to im . we will adopt the convention that
im  > 0. we want the current to be in the r direction for r = r+. this
means we pick y as the near horizon solution. thus if the solution that is
normalizable at  is

y(r) = y +  y+

: r > r+ +  ,

(6.18)

11

then the boundary condition requires that  = 0.

this is an eigenvalue equation for  which we have seen has to have
complex solutions. the actual value can be determined numerically. an im-
portant point to note here is that this equation is independent of . thus the
lyapunov exponent which is proportional to the real part of  is independent
of . as described in [8] this exponent is equal to the gluon plasma damping
coecient calculated in [6, 7]. it was shown there that to leading order in
k2 (our b or l2) this quantity is a pure number times g2t in perturbation
theory. in particular it does not have any infrared divergence. this last fact
is presumably reected in the -independence mentioned above. in fact we
nd that it is -independent even for nite b. thus the infrared divergences
that were present in the perturbative qcd calculations [6, 7] are absent here.
this is not surprising. in this formalism (which corresponds to strong cou-
pling qcd) connement and a mass gap are manifest. therefore one does
not expect infrared divergences.

also if we use (4.13) we see that  = s h

4 . thus  being some pure num-
ber independent of ratios of dimensionful parameters, we automatically nd
that s and hence  (see (4.10)) the damping coecient, is some pure number
times the temperature. we do not expect to reproduce the g-dependence as
we are in a strong coupling regime and the calculation is non-perturbative.
we cannot explicitly solve (, b) = 0 because we do not know the
functional form of . this has to be done numerically [17] and will be
reported elsewhere. nevertheless one can make the following observation.
for a given amount of energy, if the dilaton has higher l it must take longer
to reach the horizon. this is because higher l would mean its radial velocity
is smaller and also the centrifugal barrier is higher. thus thermalization
should take longer. this in turn means that the lyapunov exponents should
decrease with increasing k2. thus for instance one can expect a relation of
the form

(k2) = 0  ck2; c > 0.

thus there should be a critical k2 at which  = 0 and there would be no
thermalization. this corresponds to the impact parameter being larger than
the black hole radius. but again as mentioned in the introduction, this is
due to the neglect of the drag due to the background hawking radiation.
presumably if this eect were included, , while decreasing with increasing
k2, would always be greater than zero. this seems to agree with numerical

12

work on yang-mills done on the lattice [9].

7 conclusions

we have discussed in this paper a possible resolution of a puzzle regarding
black holes, which is simply stated: how does a pure state evolve into a state
that appears to be at nite temperature? this question is dicult to answer
directly in a theory of gravity. however using the ads/cft connection it
can be posed as a problem in yang-mills. namely if some energy is added in
a coherent form say as an electric eld excitation, at zero temperature, how
does the theory suddenly acquire a nite temperature? that this must
happen follows from the ads/cft connection. an answer to this question
is that the theory self-thermalizes. this is known to be property of chaotic
systems and yang-mills is classicaly known to be chaotic. this seems to
answer the question qualitatively.

note that there is no implication here that quantum mechanics violates
(or does not violate) unitarity. the statement is that the nal state with the
black hole appears to be at nite temperature. we are invoking the argument
[1] that a pure state can have this property, in a chaotic system.

a more quantitative check is to calculate the lyapunov exponents in
supergravity and compare with yang-mills calculation. an agreement would
not only strengthen the ads/cft conjecture, it would also say that chaotic
behaviour is there and can explain many otherwise mysterious facts about
black holes. we have set up the calculation and shown that the existence of
a horizon implies that there are complex eigenvalues. the dependence of the
lyapunov exponent on temperature is as expected from yang-mills theory on
dimensional grounds. the actual calculation involves numerical work. the
infrared divergences that show up in perturbative qcd (for the non leading
terms) do not show up here. we also have an equation for the dependence
of the lyapunaov exponent on k2. but again solving it requires numerical
work. the qualitative fact that the exponent should decrease with increasing
k can be argued on physical grounds from the supergravity viewpoint. this
is also in accord with [8, 9].

thus the role of chaos seems to be important. but more work remains to

be done to quantitatively support this idea.

seen to be equal to | c |2  velocity, where velocity = p
m.
this example illustrates how energy becomes complex when complex
boundary conditions are used to describe leakage of ux. one can also
check that the equation analogous to (5.16) for the schroedinger equation
is satised for this problem.
