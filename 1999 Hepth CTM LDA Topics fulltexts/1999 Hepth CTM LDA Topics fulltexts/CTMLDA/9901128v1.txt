we present a self-contained study of adhm multi-instantons in su(n) gauge theory, es-
pecially the novel interplay with supersymmetry and the large-n limit. we give both eld-
and string-theoretic derivations of the n = 4 supersymmetric multi-instanton action and
collective coordinate integration measure. as a central application, we focus on certain
n-point functions gn, n = 16, 8 or 4, in n = 4 su(n) gauge theory at the conformal
point (as well as on related higher-partial-wave correlators); these are correlators in which
the 16 exact supersymmetric and superconformal fermion zero modes are saturated.
in
the large-n limit, for the rst time in any 4-dimensional theory, we are able to evaluate
all leading-order multi-instanton contributions exactly. we nd compelling evidence for
maldacenas conjecture: (1) the large-n k-instanton collective coordinate space has the
geometry of a single copy of ads5  s5 .
(2) the integration measure on this space in-
cludes the partition function of 10-dimensional n = 1 su(k) gauge theory dimensionally
reduced to 0 dimensions, matching the description of d-instantons in type iib string the-
(3) in exact agreement with type iib string calculations, at the k-instanton level,
ory.

gn = n g8 kn7/2e2ikpd|k d2  fn(x1, . . . , xn), where fn is identical to a convolution of

n bulk-to-boundary supergravity propagators.

introduction

i.1 overview of the paper

the 1/n expansion proposed by t hooft twenty-ve years ago [1] continues to oer the
tantalizing prospect of a tractable approximation scheme for qcd in which connement is
visible at leading order. although this prospect is still a long way out of reach for qcd
itself, the last year has seen signicant progress in understanding the large-n limit in the
more controlled context of non-abelian gauge theories with extended supersymmetry.
in
particular, maldacena has conjectured [2] that the large-n limit of n = 4 supersymmetric
yang-mills with gauge group su(n), at the conformal point of vanishing higgs vevs, is
dual to weakly coupled type iib superstring theory on an ads5  s5 background. this
provides a realization of the long-anticipated connection between the 1/n expansion, which
is organized as a sum over feynman diagrams of dierent topology, on the one hand, and
string perturbation theory, which is a sum over string world-sheets of dierent topology, on
the other. in particular, the gauge coupling g and vacuum angle  of the four-dimensional

3

theory are given in terms of the string parameters by

g = p4gst = 4e ,

here gst is the string coupling while c(0) is the expectation value of the ramond-ramond
scalar of type iib string theory. also n appears explicitly, through the relation

 = 2c(0) .

(1.1)

where ()1 is the string tension and l is the radius of both the ads5 and s5 factors of the
background.

(1.2)

more generally, there is a precise correspondence between the nite mass string states in
an ads5  s5 background and the gauge-invariant composite operators on the yang-mills
side, and hence, a proposed equivalence between all correlators in the two theories that are
built from these operators [38]. in this paper we will focus on a class of such correlators
which are known to receive contributions from all orders in d-instantons, on the superstring
side, and from all orders in yang-mills instantons, on the gauge theory side. moreover, on
the superstring side, these contributions are known to sum to a specic modular form of the
complexied coupling constants  and  , with

(1.3)

below we will calculate these contributions from rst principles in the n = 4 theory at
large n. specically, for each topological number k, we will extract the leading semiclassical
contribution to these correlators. this is the rst time in a four-dimensional theory that the
instanton series has been explicitly evaluated to all orders. our calculation involves a novel
interplay between supersymmetry, the large-n limit, and the multi-instanton formalism of
atiyah, drinfeld, hitchin and manin (adhm) [9]. for each k, we obtain perfect quantitative
and qualitative agreement with the supergravity result, although, as described below, there
is an outstanding puzzle about the diering regimes of validity of the supergravity and gauge
theory calculations. quantitatively, we precisely recover the kth taylor coecient of the
predicted modular form. and qualitatively, we discover how the ten-dimensional ads5  s5
space emerges, in a surprising way, from the four-dimensional picture: this space describes
the geometry of the subspace of multi-instanton collective coordinates which dominates the
path integral in the large-n limit. moreover, the integration measure on this space includes
the partition function of ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric su(k) gauge theory dimen-
sionally reduced to zero dimensions, matching the description of d-instantons in type iib
string theory. in our view, this multi-faceted agreement constitutes compelling circumstantial
evidence in favor of maldacenas conjecture.

an abbreviated account of our calculation was presented in ref. [10]. the present paper
not only presents the calculational details of ref. [10] in a self-contained manner, but several
additional results as well, described below.

let us comment further on both sides of the proposed correspondence. unfortunately,
little is known about the string theory on ads5  s5, even at leading order in perturbation
theory, due to the presence of background ramond-ramond elds. to make progress, it is
necessary to focus on the regime where the radius of curvature of the background is large
compared to the string length scale (i.e., small ) in addition to weak coupling (i.e., small
in this case the iib string theory on ads5  s5 is well approximated by classical
gst).
iib supergravity in the same background. on the gauge theory side of the conjecture, per
eqs. (1.1)-(1.2), this regime corresponds to a large-n limit with g2  1 but g2n  1. recall
that the t hooft coupling g2n is the eective expansion parameter of the large-n gauge
theory [1]. thus, via maldacenas conjecture, classical supergravity yields predictions for the
strong-coupling behavior of the four-dimensional theory. stringy and quantum corrections
to classical supergravity correspond to corrections in powers of (g2n)1 and g2, respectively,
on the gauge theory side.

on the four-dimensional side, the n = 4 models constitute a particularly interesting class
of quantum eld theories in their own right. for any value of n and of the higgs vevs,
they are nite theories, with vanishing chiral anomaly and -function [11]. they are also the
original setting for olive-montonen duality [12]; consequently, the spectrum of monopoles
and dyons can in some cases be computed exactly [13]. moreover, in the absence of such
vevs, the symmetry group of the theory is enlarged both at the classical and quantum
levels: the model becomes a highly nontrivial superconformal eld theory, in an interesting
and ill-understood non-abelian coulomb phase.

yet apart from the well-studied constraints imposed by superconformal invariance for
n  3, little is known about n-point functions in this model for n > 3, beyond the regime
g2n  1 where they are amenable to standard perturbative and/or semiclassical analysis.1
maldacenas conjecture is of special interest to eld theory, precisely because (at least for
large n) it provides a quantitative means of extrapolating these correlators into a domain
where perturbation theory fails. however this also raises an important problem: it is very
hard to nd quantitative tests of the conjecture against our existing knowledge of the n = 4
theory. one way around this diculty is to isolate a special class of correlators which are
protected against quantum corrections by supersymmetry. the results of a weak coupling
calculation can then legitimately be extrapolated to strong coupling and compared with the
corresponding supergravity predictions.

the simplest examples of such supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorems involve two-
and three-point functions of certain chiral primary operators [3, 4, 1417]; these are highly
constrained by the superconformal invariance of the n = 4 theory and apparently are given
exactly by their classical free eld values. however, experience has shown that many su-

1the fact that planar diagram corrections correspond to an expansion in g2n is true in instanton back-

grounds as well as around the perturbative vacuum.

persymmetric theories contain a family of correlators which, though similarly protected, are
far less trivial. although the details vary from theory to theory, the characteristic (but not
sucient) property of these correlators is that they contain precisely the correct number of
fermions to saturate the exact zero modes of an instanton. it is well-known that instanton
contributions to the infra-red safe correlators of chiral superelds are protected against fur-
ther quantum corrections [1821]. classic examples of exact results in n = 1 supersymmetry
include instanton derivation of the aeckdineseiberg superpotential [22, 23] and of the
nsvz beta-function [24].
in theories with eight supercharges (both in d = 4 [19, 25, 26]
and d = 3 [27, 28]), the quantities which are one-loop-exact in each multi-instanton sector
are typically four-fermion correlators which come from the two-derivative/four-fermion terms
in a low-energy action. for the three-dimensional theory with sixteen supercharges studied
in [29,30] the relevant correlator is related to an eight-fermion term in the eective action for
which a non-renormalization theorem has recently been proved [31]. other relevant examples
involve the correlators of chiral operators which are the observables of a topological quan-
tum eld theory obtained by twisting the original supersymmetric gauge theory (see [32], in
particular, for an application to the n = 4 theory, which may be related to the calculation
presented below).

in this paper we will study the analogous correlators in the n = 4 superconformal theory,
although, unlike the previous examples, it is not yet known to what extent these correlators
are constrained by supersymmetry. in particular we will calculate the leading semiclassical
contribution of adhm multi-instantons to a sixteen-fermion correlator g16(x1, . . . , x16) in
n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory at large n [33, 34] (see also the review [35]).
the number of fermion insertions is dictated by the sixteen exact zero modes of the instan-
ton which are protected by the supersymmetric and superconformal invariance of the n = 4
theory with vanishing vevs (turning on the vevs reduces this number to eight). in ad-
dition, supersymmetry relates the fermionic correlator g16(x1, . . . , x16) to certain bosonic
8-point and 4-point functions g8(x1, . . . , x8) and g4(x1, . . . , x4) [34] in which the instanton
zero modes are saturated, respectively, by fermion-bilinear and fermion-quadrilinear parts of
bosonic elds.

by synthesizing maldacenas conjecture with earlier results [36] about d-instanton con-
tributions to the iib eective action, banks and green [33] have obtained a closed-form
supergravity prediction for the 4-point correlator of the stress-tensor operators in the n = 4
superconformal yang-mills theory. predictions for correlators gn (n = 16, 8 or 4) of re-
lated operators2 were obtained in [34]. the gn are expressed in terms of a non-holomorphic
modular form fn(,  ), where the modular group sl(2, z) is the s-duality symmetry group
of the type iib string theory. suggestively, the fn are amenable to a simultaneous taylor
expansion in g2, e2i and e2i . on the supergravity side, this amounts, respectively, to

current supereld associated with the superconformal and chiral su (4) transformations of the n = 4 theory
written down in [34, 37].

perturbative, d-instanton, and anti-d-instanton eects. the dictionary (1.1) then suggests
that (anti-)d-instantons are mapped onto yang-mills (anti-)instantons by the correspon-
dence. we stress once again that the supergravity prediction was derived by assuming large
g2n, while the semiclassical instanton calculation presented below is valid only for small
g2n. despite this caveat, as stated earlier, for each topological number k we nd precise
accord between our weak-coupling results and the corresponding d-instanton terms in the
banks-green prediction. above, we asserted that this agreement for the gn (which extends
to the whole tower of kaluza-klein states of supergravity compactied on s5, see sec. vi.2)
constitutes convincing evidence in favor of maldacenas conjecture. in additionthough this
is admittedly circular reasoningit can be seen as equally compelling circumstantial evidence
that a supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorem does, in fact, apply to these correlators
too.

this paper is organized as follows.

in the remainder of this introductory section, we
outline the supergravity prediction for the gn (sec. i.2) [33, 34].
in particular, a taylor
expansion of the exact solution reveals a surprising and under-appreciated aspect of the d-
instanton moduli space; namely that at any topological level k, it eectively contains only one
copyand not k copiesof ads5s5. this is contrary to what one usually expects from the
physics of d-branes: the collective dynamics of a multi-charged conguration of d-branes is
described by a non-abelian u(k) yang-mills theory on the brane world-volume. the coulomb
branch of this gauge theory describes the freedom for the branes to separate from one another.
however, it is more appropriate to interpret the d-instanton contribution to the correlation
functions gn, as being due to a charge k d-instanton bound state. this is due to the
surprising fact that the integrals over the coordinates, which one would ordinarily identify
as the relative positions of the singly-charged d-objects, are actually convergent [36, 38, 39].
this fact will be seen to play a similarly crucial role on the yang-mills side of the story, as
we elucidate in sec. v. in sec. i.3, we review the corresponding yang-mills calculation at the
one-instanton level, and show how it matches the supergravity result, both in its space-time

dependence [34], and in the overall coupling strength ()1  n [40]. section i ends with

a puzzle: navely, this agreement appears to be an accident of the one-instanton level, for
only at this level does an instanton eld-strength squared resemble a euclidean supergravity
bulk-to-boundary propagator.
indeed, even if a dilute instanton gas approximation were
justiedand generally it is notthe k-instanton yang-mills calculation would naturally
lead to k copies of ads5 (i.e., k independent instanton 4-positions and scale sizes) rather
than just one copy as the supergravity side of the correspondence implies.

motivated in part by this puzzle, in sec. ii we rst dene what we mean precisely by
the multi-instanton supermultiplet in the superconformal case and then give a thorough,
self-contained review of multi-instanton calculus in supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory.
most of this review material is borrowed from ref. [41] (written in collaboration with m.
slater) and is included herein for the readers convenience. sections ii.1-ii.4 are devoted to

7

the adhm construction of the general self-dual gauge eld conguration vn(x) of arbitrary
topological number k [9]. subsequently we esh out the remaining components of the n = 4
instanton supermultiplet: secs. ii.5-ii.6 review the construction of the four gauginos a
 (x)
(a = 1, 2, 3, 4) [42], and sec. ii.7 reviews the construction of the six adjoint scalars aab(x)
[26, 41, 43].3

semiclassical physics requires knowledge, not only of the relevant saddle-point congu-
rations that dominate a given process (in this case, the multi-instanton supermultiplet of
sec. ii), but also, of how properly to weight these congurations in the path integral. specif-
ically, one needs to construct the weighting factor

inst is the k-instanton action, and dk

where sk
phys stands for the k-instanton bosonic and
fermionic collective coordinate measure. these two quantities are studied in detail in secs. iii
and iv, respectively. sk
inst has a crucial role to play: it is responsible for lifting the non-exact
fermion zero modes, thereby ensuring a nonzero result for the grassmann integrations. for
the gauge group su(n) with n = 4 supersymmetry, the k-instanton adhm conguration
has 8kn adjoint fermion zero modes. as mentioned earlier, precisely sixteen of these modes
are exact; these are saturated by the explicit insertions of the external operators in the corre-
lators gn. the remaining 8kn  16 lifted modes must be saturated instead by bringing down
the appropriate power of sk
inst in the n = 4 model
in a somewhat indirect way, rst by implementing the supersymmetry algebra directly on the
multi-instanton collective coordinates, and then by requiring that sk
inst be a supersymmetric
invariant quantity (among other properties). in sec. iii, we present an alternative construc-
tion of sk
inst which is much more direct, albeit calculationally intensive, and leads to the same
result. in brief, the k-instanton supermultiplet is inserted into the component lagrangian,
and the space-time integrations are carried out explicitly using gausss law. in the absence
of higgs vevs, we nd that sk
inst is a pure fermion quadrilinear term (see eqs. (3.1)-(3.2)
below), with one fermion collective coordinate drawn from each of the four gaugino sectors

ization group ow to the measures of lower supersymmetry (among other constraints) suce

an alternative construction of dk
inst which is also directly relevant to the physics
of the anti-desitter/superconformal eld theory (ads/cft) correspondence. specically,
we consider n = 4 supersymmetric u(n) gauge theory as realized on a set of n parallel

jecture. here, however, we will not take the large-n supergravity limit which leads to the
strong-coupled n = 4 theory, but rather stay at weak coupling and take the ordinary decou-
pling limit   0 while keeping g2 and n xed. in fact it is well known that d-instantons
located on the d3-branes are equivalent to yang-mills instantons in the world-volume gauge
theory [46,47]. in a similar context, witten has shown that the adhm construction emerges
in a natural way from standard facts about d-branes [48]. this viewpoint turns out to be
quite powerful and, in particular, it provides a simple rederivation of the adhm formalism
developed in our previous papers. while this work was being completed, a paper which has
some overlap with sec. iv.2 has appeared [49].

the form of the measure derived in secs. iv.1-iv.2 can be termed the at measure,
as the adhm collective coordinates are integrated over as cartesian variables. however the
number of such integration variables grows with n and one must choose a more appropriate
set of coordinates before a traditional saddle-point approximation can be undertaken. to
this end, we transform to a smaller, gauge-invariant set of collective coordinates, which is
done in sec. iv.3. in the resulting gauge-invariant measure (eq. (4.55) below), the number
of integration variables is independent of n, and only grows with the topological number k.
this form of the measure is then the appropriate starting point for the large-n saddle-point
treatment that we develop beginning in sec. v.

section v has the largest overlap with the preliminary version of our paper, ref. [10].
it is devoted to marrying the large-n limit, on the one hand, with supersymmetric adhm
calculus on the other. as a warm-up, in sec. v.1 we revisit the one-instanton sector already
discussed in sec. i.3, and develop a formal saddle-point approximation to the gauge-invariant
measure as n  . to leading order in 1/n, the bosonic collective coordinate integration
turns out to be dominated by a ten-dimensional submanifold with the geometry of ads5s5.
thus we nd the intriguing result that, even at weak coupling, the large-n instanton sees
the metric of the supergravity background. the correspondence between the instanton scale-
size  and the radial direction on ads5 has been previously noted in [34,50]. indeed the power
of  in the factor d4x d 5 which enters the measure (with xn the instanton 4-position) is
forced by the scale invariance of the n = 4 model, and necessarily agrees with the volume
form of the conformally invariant space ads5. rather, the main novelty in our analysis is the
explanation of the s5 : it arises from a scalar eld a transforming in the vector representation
of the so(6) r-symmetry which is introduced in order to bilinearize the fermion quadrilinear
action sk
inst. in particular, as n  , the a variables are increasingly peaked around an s5
subspace of r6. the use of such auxiliary gaussian variables is familiar from the standard
large-n treatment of theories with fermions in the fundamental representation of su(n),
such as the gross-neveu model [51]. it is remarkable that they are not just mathematical
artifacts, but play such a central role in the ads/cft correspondence. in fact, as explained
in section iv.2, these auxiliary elds have their origin as the gauge elds of a six-dimensional
u(k) gauge theory whose dimensional reduction describes k d-instantons in the presence of

9

d3 branes.

sections v.2-v.3 extend the saddle-point method to the k-instanton case. in sec. v.2
we solve the coupled saddle-point equations at the strictly classical level, i.e., neglecting
(unjustiably) the prefactor contribution due to small uctuations. in this simple approxi-
mation scheme, we nd that the k instantons live in mutually commuting su(2) subgroups
of the su(n) gauge group, and are described by k independent copies of ads5  s5. this
is the puzzle discussed earlier, and it has to be reconciled with the supergravity side of the
correspondence. the puzzle is resolved in sec. v.3, in which the small uctuations are care-
fully taken into account. these generate a singular attractive eective potential which draws
the k instantons to a common point, thereby reducing the moduli space to a single copy of
ads5s5, precisely as required by the ads/cft correspondence. (however the k instantons
remain in mutually commuting su(2)s.) and there is a further surprise: the lagrangian
which describes small uctuations in the vicinity of this reduced moduli space turns out to be
identical to ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric su(k) yang-mills theory, dimensionally
reduced to 0 + 0 dimensions. the collective coordinate k-instanton-measure thus factorizes
into the measure on ads5  s5 times the partition function zk for this su(k) theory. thus,
the k-instanton semiclassical measure, r dk
inst, in the n = 4 yang-mills theory is
reduced to the partition function of the multi-d-instanton matrix model. we then use the
recent explicit evaluation of zk [5254] to complete the specication of the eective large-n
k-instanton measure; the nal expression is given in eq. (5.45).
intriguingly, this matrix
model is precisely the one posited by ref. [55] as a denition of type iib string theory.

phys expsk

in sec. v.4 we comment further on zk. in particular, it is remarkable that zk is precisely
the partition function that describes k-d-instantons in at space [36]. it is also noteworthy
how, having started with an su(n) gauge theory, one ends up with an su(k) gauge theory;
this type of duality is well known from a string theory context [4648], and is apparent
from our discussion in sec. iv.2. we also discuss the expected relation between zk and the
euler character of the charge-k adhm moduli space.

in sec. vi we use this large-n eective measure to evaluate the correlators of interest.
section vi.1 is devoted to the correlators gn, with n = 16, 8 or 4; as advertised above, we
nd exact agreement with the supergravity prediction of [34]. however the n insertions in
these correlators all correspond, on the supergravity side, to elds which have no dependence
on s5, i.e. which are s-wave. as such, they do not probe this part of the string theory
background. accordingly, in sec. vi.2 we extend the analysis to correlators corresponding to
supergravity elds which are higher partial waves on s5, i.e. massive kaluza-klein modes on
s5, and verify the proposed ads/cft correspondence for a tower of such operators. this
analysis highlights the novel role played by the auxiliary scalar variables a in our formalism.

section vii contains some concluding thoughts. section vii.1 gives a slanted historical
largely stymied in nonsupersymmetric

overview of the adhm multi-instanton program:

10

applications due to the intractability of the nonlinear constraints and the lack of knowledge
of the measure; recently rejuvenated in the context of supersymmetric theories; and, as
the present paper demonstrates, simplied even more dramatically in the large-n limit. and
sec. vii.2 briey discusses the source of both 1/n corrections and (despite the aforementioned
nonrenormalization theorem) g2 corrections to the yang-mills calculations.

i.2 review of the superstring prediction

before we describe in detail the superstring prediction, some general comments are in or-
der. as we have alluded to in the last section, maldacenas conjecture [2] relates type iib
supergravity on ads5  s5 to the large-n limit of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills the-
ory in four dimensions. the renement of this correspondence presented in [3, 4] identies
the n = 4 theory as living on the four-dimensional boundary of ads5. in particular, each
chiral primary operator o in the boundary conformal eld theory is identied with a partic-
ular kaluza-klein mode of the supergravity elds which we denote as o. the generating
function for the correlation functions of o is then given in terms of the supergravity action
siib[o] according to

(cid:28)exp z d4x jo(x)o(x)(cid:29) = expsiib [o; j] .

(1.5)

the iib action on the right-hand side of the equation is evaluated on a conguration which
solves the classical eld equations subject to the condition o(x) = j(x) on the four-
dimensional boundary.

in most applications considered so far, the relation (1.5) has primarily been applied at
the level of classical supergravity, which corresponds to n  , with g2n xed and large, in
the boundary theory [3, 4, 14, 15, 5665]. however, the full equivalence of iib superstrings on
ads5s5 and n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory conjectured in [2] suggests that (1.5)
should hold more generally, with quantum and stringy corrections to the classical supergravity
action corresponding to g2 and 1/g2n corrections in the n = 4 theory, respectively. the
particular comparison that concerns us here is between yang-mills instanton contributions
to the correlators of o generated by the left-hand side of (1.5) and d-instanton corrections
to the iib eective action on the right-hand side. for future reference, the standard metric
on ads5  s5, in coordinates x = (xn, , ), is given as,

ds2 = gdxdx =

(1.6)

here,  is a unit so(6) vector denoting a point on the unit 5-sphere. the four-dimensional
theory in question lives on the boundary of ads5 which is located at  = 0.

11

the relevant d-instanton contributions arise as ()3 corrections [33] to the classical iib
theory on ads5  s5. in particular, as in more conventional eld theory settings, the correc-
tions take the form of instanton-induced vertices in a local eective action. the d-instanton
contribution to an n-point correlator gn comes from a tree level feynman diagram with one
vertex, located at some point (xn, , ) in the bulk of ads5  s5. the diagram also has n
external legs corresponding to operator insertions on the boundary. the position-space feyn-
man rules associate an overall constant with the vertex and a bulk-to-boundary propagator,
to be described below, with each external leg [3, 4, 57]. the selection rule which species
the necessary fermionic insertions is conveniently encoded by integrating over grassmann
variables  which correspond to the sixteen supersymmetries of the iib theory which are
broken by the d-instanton. these variables are associated to the sixteen supersymmetric
and superconformal zero modes of an instanton conguration on the yang-mills side. the
nal amplitude is then obtained by integrating over the position of the vertex on ads5  s5.
hence the combined bosonic and fermionic integration measure for the vertex is ,

z g d10x d16 =z d4x d

5

d5  d16 .

(1.7)

for instance, the bulk-to-boundary propagator for an so(6) singlet scalar free eld of mass
m on ads5 is,

k(x, ; x, 0) =



(2 + (x  x)2) ,

(1.8)

where (ml)2 = (  4).

we now turn in detail to the iib superstring prediction [33] (closely following the more
detailed treatment in [34]). in [36], green and gutperle conjectured an exact form for certain
non-perturbative (in gst) corrections to certain terms in the type iib supergravity eective
action. in the present application, where the string theory is compactied on ads5 s5, it is
important for the overall consistency of the banks-green prediction that the non-perturbative
terms in the eective action do not alter the ads5  s5 background, since the latter is
conformally at [33]. in particular, at leading order beyond the einstein-hilbert term in the
derivative expansion, the iib eective action is expected to contain a totally antisymmetric
16-dilatino eective vertex of the form [36, 66]

()1z d10xpdetg e/2 f16(,  ) 16 + h.c.

(1.9)

here  is a complex chiral so(9, 1) spinor, and f16 is a certain weight (12,12) modular form
under sl(2, z). at the same order in the derivative expansion there are other terms related
to (1.9) by supersymmetry and involving other modular forms fn(,  ), with n = 8 and 4.
this modular symmetry, is precisely s-duality of the type iib superstring, and although this
does not completely determine the modular forms fn, green and gutperle [36] were strongly

12

attracted to the following conjecture, later proved in ref. [67]:

fn(,  ) = (im )3/2 x(p,q)6=(0,0)

(p + q )n11/2(p + q )n+5/2.

(1.10)

these rather arcane expressions turn out to have the right modular properties, i.e. weight
(n  4,n + 4), and also have very suggestive weak coupling expansions [38]:

(1.13)

the summation over d in (1.12) runs over the positive integral divisors of k. notice that,
having taken into account the conjectured correspondence (1.1) to the couplings of four-
dimensional yang-mills theory, the expansion (1.11) has the structure of a semiclassical
expansion: the rst two terms correspond to the tree and one-loop pieces, while the sum on
k is interpretable as a sum on yang-mills instanton number, the rst and second terms in the
square bracket being instantons and anti-instantons, respectively (this is dictated by the 
dependence). each of these terms includes a perturbative expansion around the instantons,
although notice that the leading order anti-instanton contributions are suppressed by a factor
of g4n16 (so not suppressed for n = 4) relative to the leading order instanton contributions.

in the present paper, our focus will be on the leading semiclassical contributions to the fn;
by this we mean, for each value of the topological number k, the leading-order contribution
in g2. for f16 and f8 the leading semiclassical contributions come from instantons only and
have the form

(1.14)

neglecting g2 corrections. for the special case of f4 there is an identical anti-instanton
contribution with i  i . later, we shall nd it very signicant that e/2fn has a
dependence on the instanton number of the form kn7/2. in type iib superstring theory, the
terms in the square bracket in (1.12), which are non-perturbative in the string coupling, are
interpreted as being due to d-instantons.

from the eective vertex (1.9) one can construct greens functions g16(x1, . . . , x16) for

in these expressions the xi are four-dimensional space-time coordinates for the boundary of
ads5 while  is the fth, radial, coordinate. the quantity t16 in eq. (1.15) is (in the notation
of ref. [34]) a 16-index antisymmetric invariant tensor which enforces fermi statistics and
ensures, inter alia, that precisely 8 factors of 1/25 and 8 factors of 1/2n are picked out
in the product over k f
7/2. related by supersymmetry to g16, are correlation functions g8
and g4 which have an analogous structure to (1.15), but involving dierent bulk-to-boundary
propagators and with overall factors that we can summarize as

gn  ()1e/2fn(,  ) .

(1.18)

notice that there is no explicit dependence in these expressions on the coordinates on s5;
in particular, the propagator does not depend on them (save through an overall multiplicative
factor which we drop). this is because g16, g8 and g4 are correlators of operators whose
supergravity associates are constant on s5. in sec. vi.2 below, after we have elucidated the
meaning of the s5 in the four-dimensional picture, we will broaden the discussion to include
operators that correspond to elds on the supergravity side that vary over s5, and verify
that the correct dependence on these coordinates ensues.

notice further that in the expression (1.15), the ve-dimensional space-time dependence
does not mix in any way with the  dependence, where the latter is carried solely by the
modular form f16. in particular this means that for arbitrary topological charge k, the d-
instanton contribution to g16 only contains a single copyand not k copiesof ads5, as
evinced by the single copy of the d4x d 5 volume form in eq. (1.15). the rational for
this, as we alluded to earlier, is that when only 16 fermion zero-modes are saturated, as
is apparent in the term in the eective action (1.9), it is more appropriate to think of a
conguration of k d-instantons as a single charged k bound state since the integrals over the
relative positions are actually convergent [36]. however, it will be an interesting challenge
(successfully resolved in sec. v.3 below) to reproduce this feature from the yang-mills side,

14

rather than k distinct copies which one would normally expect from a dilute instanton gas
approximation (if it could be justied). beyond this qualitative agreement, it is the principal
goal of this paper to demonstrate that the identical expression for g16 emerges from the
gauge theory side of the correspondence, to leading semiclassical order (meaning, for each
topological number k, to leading order in g2). but before developing the adhm machinery
necessary to treat the case of general k, let us review the rather simpler situation for k = 1.

i.3 review of the yang-mills calculation at the one-instanton level

according to maldacenas conjecture, the correlator (1.15) in the iib theory should corre-
spond to a certain 16-fermion correlator in four-dimensional large-n supersymmetric yang-
mills theory. the fermion operator in the four-dimensional yang-mills picture with the right
transformation properties to correspond to the dilatino is the gauge-invariant composite op-
erator [3, 4, 34]

a

 = g2mn 

 trn vmn a
 ,

(1.19)

which is a spin-1/2 fermionic component of the supereld noether current detailed in [34,37].
here vmn is the su(n) gauge eld strength while the a
 are the weyl gauginos, with the
index a = 1, 2, 3, 4 labeling the four supersymmetries. the numerical tensor mn projects
out the self-dual component of the eld strength,4 so that, at leading order, only instantons
rather than anti-instantons can contribute.

to begin to see how, in the yang-mills picture, a 16-point correlator of the operator (1.19)
might possibly reproduce the structure of eq. (1.15), let us recall the suggestive observation
made by [34]. these authors focused on the one-instanton sector of n = 4 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory with gauge group su(2). in this particularly transparent case, the single
instanton contains precisely sixteen adjoint fermion zero modes: a supersymmetric plus a
superconformal zero mode, each of which is a weyl 2-spinor, times four supersymmetries. a
non-vanishing 16-fermion correlator is therefore obtained by saturating each of the fermion
insertions with a distinct such zero mode. the semiclassical yang-mills calculation then
proceeds by replacing vmn in the composite operator (1.19) by the standard one-instanton
eld strength vmn(x x), with x the center of the instanton; likewise for a
 one substitutes
into eq. (1.19) the well-known expression for the gaugino:5

4we use wess and bagger conventions throughout [69], continued to euclidean space via (x0, ~x)  (x0, i~x),
with nmanam  anan, except that our convention for integrating weyl spinors is r d2 2 = 2, rather

than wess and baggers 1.

here, the power of  in the integration measure is xed by the fact that the n = 4 model
has vanishing -function; the power of g comes from combining the explicit dependence in
eq. (1.23) with factors of g8 and g16 from the bosonic and fermionic integrations, respectively
[70]; and c2 is an overall numerical constant.

(1.23)

(1.24)

as the authors of ref. [34] point out, the space-time dependence of the one-instanton
yang-mills expression (1.24) precisely matches the supergravity expression (1.15). indeed,
 and  a in eq. (1.24) produces (by
performing the sixteen grassmann integrations over a
denition) the totally antisymmetric tensor t16 tied into sixteen propagators k f
7/2. further-
more, the remaining integration measure for the ve bosonic collective coordinates {, xn}
in eq. (1.24) is identical to the volume form of ads5 that appears in eq. (1.15); there,
the scale-size  is re-interpreted as the inverse of the radial position of the d-instanton in
ads5 [34, 50].

beyond the spatial dependence, one also nds agreement at the one-instanton level in the
overall strength of the couplings in front of the two expressions. on the supergravity side,
from eqs. (1.11)-(1.15) one extracts the one-instanton prefactor

()1 e/2 f16(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1-inst  g24 e82/g2+i n ,

up to an overall numerical constant. this g dependence is already present in the yang-mills
expression (1.24) [34]. reproducing this n dependence, too, means generalizing the above
yang-mills calculation from su(2) to su(n), which was done in ref. [40]. in n = 4 su(n)

(1.25)

16

gauge theory a single instanton has a total of 8n adjoint fermion zero modes so that for
n > 2 there are additional zero modes beyond the sixteen a
 and  a modes which must
be lifted in order to obtain a non-zero result. as in several other cases in three [30] and
four [44] dimensions, this lifting is due to the presence of a specic grassmann quadrilinear
term in the instanton action (see sec. iii below). pulling down 2n  4 powers of this
quadrilinear and performing the grassmann integrations over the lifted modes turns out to
be straightforward, and is reviewed below in sec. v.1. the chief result of ref. [40] is that
the yang-mills expression (1.24) continues to hold for the gauge group su(n), up to the
replacement c2  cn where6

22n +49 316 10 = 24731621/2n(cid:0) 1  5

the nal equality following from stirlings formula. in this algebraically nontrivial way, the
overall n dependence predicted by supergravity is recovered in the large-n limit of the
gauge theory. moreover, since

(1.27)

from eqs. (1.1)-(1.2), the explicit form of the 1/n series implied by the exact yang-mills
one-instanton result (1.26) gives an innite number of predictions for corrections in powers
of gst()2 on the iib side of the correspondence.

upon reection, however, one might suspect that the agreement described above between
the supergravity and yang-mills expressions for g16 is an accident of the one-instanton sector.
for, only in that sector is the instanton action density trn v2
mn proportional to the propagator
k4, as per eq. (1.21). as reviewed in sec. ii.1 below, for topological number k the instanton
action density is a rational function of x whose denominator generically involves a polynomial
in x of degree 2k, raised to a power. in particular, this means that for k > 1, the k-instanton
density generically looks nothing like a classical propagator. one plausible way around this
problem is to posit that the dilute instanton gas approximation somehow becomes valid in the
yang-mills k-instanton calculation. if this were the case, however, the k-instanton density
would resemble a sum of k distinct one-instanton densities (hence a sum of supergravity
propagators). moreover, the moduli space would generically contain k distinct copies (rather
than a single copy) of ads5, meaning integrations over k distinct instanton 4-positions and
sizes.
in other words, even if the dilute instanton gas approximation were valid, the k-
instanton yang-mills expression for k > 1 can reasonably be expected to look nothing like
the supergravity result (1.15)!

actually we will nd below that precisely the right propagator-like structure of the in-
stanton density, accompanied by the collapse of k copies of ads5 to just one copy, is recovered
6the constant cn diers by a factor of 28 from that quoted in [40]. the dierence is due to the present

conventions of footnote 4 for integrating weyl spinors.

17

in the yang-mills calculation as n  . this is one of several pleasing simplications that
occur in the multi-instanton formalism when one passes to the large-n limit.

ii the n = 4 multi-instanton supermultiplet

we now review the formalism of adhm instantons, suitably supersymmetrized. there are
two philosophically distinct ways to introduce the multi-instanton supermultiplet. one way is
to view it as the exact solution of the coupled classical euler-lagrange equations in euclidean
space; in the absence of all higgs vevs such exact solutions do of course exist. our ultimate
goal, however, is not just to nd classical solutions, but rather to calculate their quantum
contributions to correlators gn, which includes the eects of a perturbative expansion in the
instanton background. an ecient and elegant way to take the leading perturbations into
account automatically is to modify the background conguration itself as explained below;
however, the instanton supermultiplet is then no longer an exact solution to the coupled
equations of motion. this is the essence of the second approach which we follow in this
paper.

the key distinction between the two methods is whether or not all of the fermion zero
modes are included in the multi-instanton multiplet. in n = 4 su(n) gauge theory there
are 8kn fermion zero modes of the covariant weyl operator /d = ndn in the background of
the gauge-eld instanton of topological charge k. however, most of these are at directions
of the action only at the gaussian level and are lifted when the action is expanded to
higher order in uctuations. the zero modes which remain exact to all orders are those
protected by symmetry, namely the eight supersymmetric and eight superconformal fermion
zero modes (2.53a)-(2.53b). if one insists on working with only exact solutions, then only
these sixteen fermion modes can be included in the multi-instanton super-multiplet; the k-
instanton action is then simply a constant, 82k/g2  ik. the remaining 8kn  16 fermion
zero modes are lifted and are treated in this method as uctuations around the background.
if one nevertheless attaches grassmann collective coordinates to the lifted modes, one nds
that the resulting k-instanton eective action will depend on these collective coordinates. in
particular there will be a grassmann quadrilinear term (eq. (3.2) below) generated by scalar
exchange through the yukawa couplings; since this is a tree-level diagram it is not forbidden
by a perturbative nonrenormalization theorem.

instead, in the alternative approach adopted here, we will include all 8kn dirac operator
fermion zero modes in the multi-instanton super-multiplet from the outset. the aforemen-
tioned scalar exchange tree graph is then already built in at the classical level, so that the
quadrilinear action (3.2) is generated without our having to calculate separate diagrams.
however, in this more ecient approach, the coupled euler-lagrange equations must be

18

solved iteratively, order by order in g; this is not surprising since the multi-instanton congu-
ration is no longer an exact solution. in this way, our denition of the multi-instanton super-
multiplet is similar to the more general case of the instanton calculus in the non-conformal
cases developed in [26, 41, 43, 44]. recall that for a non-zero vev non-trivial exact solutions
of the coupled euler-lagrange equations cannot exist and instead one is instructed to solve
constrained equations [71] iteratively in g; the two formalisms are the same in the vev 0
limit.

as stated earlier, in this paper we restrict our attention to leading semiclassical order,
meaning the rst non-vanishing order in g at each topological level. for convenience we
will rescale all the elds so that the only g dependence in the action is through the overall
coecient g2; the explicit g dependence in the euler-lagrange equations can be trivially
restored by undoing this rescaling.

the hallmark of adhm calculus is that, with the correct ansatz for the classical com-
ponent elds, their dening euler-lagrange equations are mapped into nite-dimensional
matrix equations. thus, for the gauge eld vm(x), the yang-mills equation (a nonlinear dif-
ferential equation) is mapped into the nonlinear adhm constraint equations (2.15a)-(2.15c)
below. similarly, for the classical gauginos a
 (x), the covariant weyl equation (a linear ho-
mogeneous dierential equation) is mapped into the homogeneous linear constraint equations
(2.50a)-(2.50b) below. and nally, for the classical adjoint higgs elds aab(x), the covari-
ant klein-gordon equation with a yukawa source term (an inhomogeneous linear dierential
equation) is mapped into the inhomogeneous linear constraint equation (2.72) below. note
that at leading semiclassical order, the anti-gauginos  a(x) and the auxiliary supereld
components f and d are all turned o; they do, however, turn on at a higher order in g, in
the process of solving by iteration the coupled approximate euler-lagrange equations.

ii.1 construction of the classical gauge eld

in secs. ii.1-ii.4 we concern ourselves with pure su(n) gauge theory, without fermions or
scalars. gauge elds vm are traceless anti-hermitian n  n matrices and

vmn = mvn  nvm + [vm, vn]

(2.1)

is the eld-strength. the adhm multi-instanton is the general solution of the self-duality
equation

in the sector of topological number (equivalently, winding or instanton number) k, where

vmn = vmn  1

2mnklvkl

(2.2)

k = 

1

162z d4x trn vmn vmn .

19

(2.3)

the adhm construction of such multi-instantons is discussed in refs. [9,42,72,73]. here we
follow, with minor modications, the su(n) formalism of refs. [41, 42].

the basic object in the adhm construction is the (n + 2k)  2k complex-valued matrix

[n+2k][2k] which is taken to be linear in the space-time variable xn :7

[n+2k][2k] (x)  [n+2k][k][2] (x) = a[n+2k][k][2] + b[n+2k][k][2] x[2][2] .

(2.4)

here we have represented the [2k] index set as a product of two index sets [k]  [2] and have
used a quaternionic representation of xn,

x[2][2] = x  = xn n

  .

(2.5)

it follows that n = bn. by counting the number of bosonic and fermionic zero modes, we
will soon verify that k in eq. (2.4) is indeed the instanton number while n is the parameter
in the gauge group su(n). as discussed below, the complex-valued constant matrices a and
b in eq. (2.4) constitute a (highly over complete) set of k-instanton collective coordinates.

for generic x, the null-space of the hermitian conjugate matrix (x) is n-dimensional,
as it has n fewer rows than columns. the basis vectors for this null-space can be assembled
into an (n + 2k)  n dimensional complex-valued matrix u(x),

[2k][n+2k] u[n+2k][n] = 0 = u[n][n+2k] [n+2k][2k] ,

where u is orthonormalized according to

u[n][n+2k] u[n+2k][n] = 1[n][n] .

(2.6)

(2.7)

in turn, the classical adhm gauge eld vm is constructed from u as follows. note rst that
for the special case k = 0, the antisymmetric gauge conguration vn dened by

vn[n][n] = u[n][n+2k] n u[n+2k][n ]

(2.8)

is pure gauge (i.e., it is a gauge transformation of the vacuum), so that it automatically
solves the self-duality equation (2.2) in the vacuum sector. the adhm ansatz is that eq. (2.8)
continues to give a solution to eq. (2.2), even for nonzero k. as we shall see, this requires
the additional condition

[2][k][n+2k] [n+2k][k][2] = 1[2][2] f1

[k][k] ,

(2.9)

where f is an arbitrary x-dependent k  k dimensional hermitian matrix.

7for clarity, in sec. ii we will occasionally show matrix sizes explicitly, e.g. the su (n ) gauge eld will
[n ][n ]. to represent matrix multiplication in this notation we will underline contracted indices:

be denoted vm
(ab)[a][c] = a[a][b] b[b][c]. also we adopt the shorthand x [myn] = xmyn  xnym.

20

to check the validity of the adhm ansatz, we rst observe that eq. (2.9) combined with

the null-space condition (2.6) imply the completeness relation

p[n +2k][n +2k]  u[n+2k][n]

u[n][n+2k]

= 1[n+2k][n+2k]  [n+2k][k][2] f[k][k]

[2][k][n+2k] .

(2.10)

note that p, as dened, is actually a projection operator; the fact that one can write p in
these two equivalent ways turns out to be a useful trick in adhm algebra, used pervasively
below. with the above relations together with integrations by parts, the expression for the
eld strength vmn may be massaged as follows:

vmn   [mvn] + v [mvn] =  [m( un]u) + ( u  [mu)( u n]u) =  [m u(1  u u )n]u

=  [m u f n]u = u  [mf n] u = ub[mn]fbu = 4 u bmnfbu .

(2.11)

self-duality of the eld strength then follows automatically from the well-known self-duality
property of the numerical tensor mn, dened by [69]

mn = 1




4 (m  

n  n   

m ) .

(2.12)

a technical point: the above construction does not actually distinguish between the gauge
group u(n) and su(n), i.e., the classical gauge eld constructed in this way is not au-
tomatically traceless (unlike the eld strength). however, it can be made so by a gauge
transformation u  ug, where g  u(1).

already at this stage we can infer the behavior of trn v2

mn as a rational function of x. from
eq. (2.9) we see that the k  k matrix f1 is a quadratic polynomial in x. consequently the
denominator of f itself is a polynomial in x of degree 2k (i.e., like detf1); the denominator
of trn v2
mn then generically goes like the fourth power of this polynomial, as follows from
eqs. (2.10)-(2.11). this explains our comments at the end of sec. i.3, that only at the
one-instanton level can this quantity look like a classical supergravity propagator, which
only involves quadratic forms in the denominator. we will see in sec. v below how this
pessimistic observation is averted when the adhm formalism is combined with the large-n
limit.

in the next subsection we will count the independent degrees of freedom of the adhm
conguration and conrm that it has precisely the number of collective coordinates needed
to describe a k-instanton solution.

ii.2 constraints, collective coordinates and canonical forms

we have seen that the adhm construction for su(n) makes essential use of matrices of
various sizes: (n + 2k)  n matrices u, (n + 2k)  2k matrices , a and b, k  k matrices

21

 , n , x , etc. (notice that when n = 2, the dimensionalities of
f , and 2  2 matrices n
u and  dier from the su(2) as sp(1) formalism reviewed in ref. [26].) accordingly, we
introduce a variety of index assignments:

instanton number indices [k] :

color indices [n] :

adhm indices [n + 2k] :

quaternionic (weyl) indices [2] :

lorentz indices [4] :

1  i, j, l     k
1  u, v     n
1  ,      n + 2k
, , ,     = 1, 2
m, n   = 0, 1, 2, 3

no extra notation is required for the 2k dimensional column index attached to , a and b,
since it can be factored as [2k] = [k]  [2] = j , etc., as in eq. (2.4). with these index
conventions, eq. (2.4) reads

 i (x) = a i  + b

 i x  ,

while the factorization condition (2.9) becomes

 

i (x) = a 

i + x  b

i ,




i  j  = 


 (f1)ij .

(2.13)

(2.14)

combining eqs. (2.13)-(2.14), and noting that fij(x) is arbitrary, one extracts the three
x-independent conditions on a and b:

 ,

a 
i aj  = ( 1
j = b
b
a 
i
b
i b
j = ( 1

2 aa)ij  
i a 
bb)ij  
 .

j ,

2

(2.15a)

(2.15b)

(2.15c)

these three conditions are known as the adhm constraints [42, 72]. they dene a set of
coupled quadratic conditions on the matrix elements of a, a, b and b. as such, for k > 3, they
cannot be solved in closed form in terms of algebraic functions. this unfortunate fact is the
single biggest historical impediment that has hindered progress in multi-instanton calculus.

the elements of the matrices a and b comprise the collective coordinates for the k-instanton
gauge conguration. clearly the number of independent such elements grows as k2, even after
accounting for the constraints (2.15a)-(2.15c). in contrast, the number of physical collective
coordinates should equal 4kn which scales linearly with k. 8 it follows that a and b consti-
tute a highly redundant set. much of this redundancy can be eliminated by noting that the

8to see this, consider the limit of k far-separated (distinguishable) instantons; each individual instanton is
then described by four positions, one scale size, and 4n5 iso-orientations, totaling 4n collective coordinates.
usually, as in [72, 74], the number of collective coordinates of the k-instanton is quoted as 4kn  n 2 + 1
for k  n/2 and 4k2 + 1 for k < n/2. these formulae represent only true collective coordinates, that is,
excluding the global gauge rotations of the k-instanton conguration. in contrast, in our counting we include
such global rotations since they appear in our k-instanton measure. then the total number of collective
coordinates is 4kn .

22

adhm construction is unaected by x-independent transformations of the form

[n+2k][k][2]  [n+2k][n+2k] [n+2k][k][2] b1

[k][k] ,

u[n+2k][n]  [n+2k][n+2k] u[n+2k][n] ,

f[k][k]  b[k][k] f[k][k] b[k][k] ,

(2.16)

provided   u(n + 2k) and b  gl(k, c). (these are in addition to the usual space-time
gauge symmetries reviewed in sec. 6 of [26].) exploiting these symmetries, one can choose a
representation in which b assumes a simple canonical form [42]:

b[n+2k][2k] = (cid:18)0[n][2k]

1[2k][2k](cid:19) ,

a[n+2k][2k] = (cid:18)w[n][2k]

a[2k][2k](cid:19) .

(2.17)

we can make this canonical form a little more explicit with a convenient representation

of the index set [n + 2k]. we decompose each adhm index   [n + 2k] into9

 = u + l ,

1  u  n ,

1  l  k ,

 = 1, 2 .

(2.18)

in other words, the top n  2k submatrices in eq. (2.17) have rows indexed by u  [n],
whereas the bottom 2k2k submatrices have rows indexed by the pair l  [k][2]. equation
(2.17) then becomes

a i  = a(u+l) i  = (cid:18) wu i 

i = a  (u+l)
a 

i

 i = b

i = bu+l

(u+l) i = (cid:18) 0
i = (cid:0)0 ,  

 

(2.19a)

(2.19b)

(2.19c)

(2.19d)

with a and b in the canonical form (2.19a), the third adhm constraint of (2.15c) is satised
automatically, while the remaining constraints (2.15a) and (2.15b) boil down to:

tr2  caa = 0

(an) = an .

(2.20a)

(2.20b)

in eq. (2.20a) we have contracted a a  with the three pauli matrices ( c) 
, while in

eq. (2.20b) we have decomposed (a )li and (a )il in our usual quaternionic basis of spin
matrices:

(a )li = (an)li n

  ,

(a )il = (an)il n  .

(2.21)

9the weyl index  in this decomposition is raised and lowered with the  tensor as always [69], whereas

for the [n ] and [k] indices u and l there is no distinction between upper and lower indices.

23

note that the canonical form for b given in eq. (2.19a) is preserved by a residual u(k)

subgroup of the u(n + 2k)  gl(k, c) symmetry group (2.16), namely:
0[n][2k] r[2k][2k](cid:19) [n+2k][2k] r[2k][2k]

[n+2k][2k]  (cid:18)1[n][n]

0[2k][n]

(2.22)

where r[2k][2k] = rij 
acts as



 and rij  u(k). in terms of w and a, this residual transformation

wui   wuj  rji ,

(a )ij  ril (a )lp rpj .
it follows that the physical moduli space, mk
phys, of inequivalent self-dual gauge congurations
in the topological sector k is the quotient of the space mk of all solutions of the adhm
canonical constraints (2.20a) and (2.20b), by this residual symmetry group u(k):

(2.23)

mk

phys =

mk
u(k)

.

(2.24)

finally we can count the independent collective coordinate degrees of freedom of the
adhm multi-instanton. a general complex matrix a[n+2k][2k] has 4k(n + 2k) real degrees of
freedom. the two adhm conditions (2.20a) and (2.20b) impose 3k2 and 4k2 real constraints,
respectively, while modding out by the residual u(k) symmetry removes another k2 degrees
of freedom. in total we therefore have

4k(n + 2k)  3k2  4k2  k2 = 4kn

(2.25)

real degrees of freedom, precisely as required. of these, the four real degrees of freedom
x  = xnn

  corresponding to

are the translational collective coordinates, as is obvious from eq. (2.13).

ai  = b

i x 

(2.26)

ii.3 asymptotics of the multi-instanton

let us determine the instanton vn more explicitly, in a particularly useful gauge. this entails
solving for u, and hence vn itself via (2.8), in terms of .
it is convenient to make the
decomposition:

u[n+2k][n] = (cid:18) v[n][n]

u[2k][n](cid:19) , [n+2k][2k] = (cid:18) w[n][2k]

[2k][2k](cid:19) .

then from the completeness condition (2.10) one nds

v[n][n]

v[n][n] = 1[n][n]  w[n][k][2] f[k][k] w[2][k][n] .

24

(2.27)

(2.28)

for any v that solves this equation, one can nd another by right-multiplying it by an x-
dependent u(n) matrix. a specic choice of v corresponds to xing the space-time gauge.
the instanton singular gauges correspond to taking any one of the 2n choices of matrix
square roots:

next, u in eq. (2.27) is determined in terms of v via

v = (1  wf w)1/2 .

which likewise follows from eq. (2.10).

u = f w v 1

(2.29)

(2.30)

equations (2.29) and (2.30) determine u in (2.27), and hence the gauge eld vn via eq.
(2.8). we list for later use the leading large-|x| asymptotic behavior of several key adhm
quantities, assuming instanton singular gauge (2.29):

  bx ,

fkl 

1

|x|2 kl ,

u  

1

|x|2 x w ,

v  1[n][n] .

(2.31)

ii.4 connection to the usual one-instanton collective coordinates,

and the dilute instanton gas limit

it is illuminating to compare the adhm collective coordinates contained in the matrix a, to
the more familiar variables describing the instanton position, size, and iso-orientation. let us
rst focus on the one-instanton sector. in particular, let us verify that the usual one instanton
solution [70, 75] follows from the general adhm formalism reviewed above. we adopt the
canonical form (2.19a)-(2.19d) and set the instanton number k = 1, thus dropping the i, j
indices. contrary to the su(2) as sp(1) treatment of ref. [26], now the adhm constraints
(2.20a) and (2.20b) do not disappear in the one-instanton sector. instead, eq. (2.20b) says
that an is real,

after which eq. (2.20a) collapses to

an  xn  r4 ,

w 

u wu  = 2  

 .

(2.32)

(2.33)

the quantities  and xn will soon be identied with the instanton scale size and space-time
position, respectively. it is convenient to put w in the form:

wu  = [n][n] (cid:18)0[n 2][2]

1[2][2] (cid:19) ,

 

su(n)
su(n  2)

.

(2.34)

25

setting  = 1 initially, we nd for  and f :

[n+2][2] = 
0[n 2][2]
  1[2][2]

y[2][2]


 ,

f =

1

y2 + 2 ,

v[n][n] =  1[n 2][n 2]

with y = (x  x). equations (2.29)-(2.30) then amount to
0
y2+2(cid:17)1/2
(cid:16) y2
y2(y2+2)(cid:17)1/2

u[2][n] = (cid:18)0[2][n 2]

, (cid:16)

and

the gauge eld then follows from eq. (2.8):

(2.40)

we see that the instanton always lives in an su(2) subgroup of the su(n) gauge group. an
explicit representation of this embedding is formed by the three composite su(2) generators

(tc)uv = 2 wu  ( c) 

 w


v ,

c = 1, 2, 3.

(2.41)

next let us consider the general k-instanton conguration. in order to make contact with
familiar non-adhm collective coordinates, it is necessary to pass to the dilute instanton gas
limit. in adhm language this corresponds to the limit

[an , am]  0  m, n .

(2.42)

note that this condition is invariant under the residual u(k) symmetry (2.23). however,
eq. (2.42) means that there exists a preferred u(k) transformation which simultaneously
diagonalizes the four an matrices:

an = diag(cid:0)(an)11, . . . , (an)kk(cid:1) .

26

(2.43)

with this choice, the individual collective coordinates of the k far-separated instantons are
the obvious analogs of the one-instanton expressions (2.32), (2.33) and (2.41):

n = (an)ii ,
x i

i = 1
iu wui  ,
i wui  ( c) 
i )uv = 2

(2.44a)

(2.44b)

(2.44c)

where the (unsummed) index i = 1, . . . , k labels the individual instantons.

ii.5 construction of the adjoint fermion zero modes

in a supersymmetric theory the gauge eld vm is accompanied by a gaugino a, where the
index a runs over the number of independent supersymmetries. in particular, the n = 4
model has an su(4)r = so(6)r r-symmetry, and the a transform in the fundamental
representation of the su(4)r or equivalently in the spinor representation of the so(6)r.

in the leading semiclassical approximation, the a are replaced by the non-trivial solutions

to the covariant weyl equation in the adhm background,

/da = 0 ,

(2.45)

where /d = ndn. by the index theorem, the zero modes of /d comprise 2kn independent
grassmann degrees of freedom for each supersymmetry. as discussed in [76] in the one-
instanton context, these zero modes can be thought of as the superpartners of the instanton.
explicit expressions for the adjoint fermion zero modes in the adhm background were rst
obtained in [42]. in our notation they read (cf. eq. (7.1) of [26]):

(a

 )uv = u 

ifijb

uma

juv  u 

u bi fij ma

j uv .

(2.46)

i and ma

here ma
are constant (n + 2k)  k and k  (n + 2k) matrices of grassmann
collective coordinates; they can be viewed as either two real grassmann matrices or as two
complex grassmann matrices which are hermitian conjugates of one another.

j

in order to verify that the ansatz (2.46) satises the weyl equation (2.45), we use the

general dierentiation formulae (see eqs. (2.8), (2.10), (2.13) and (2.14) above)

nf = f  n( 1

2

together with

  )  f = (f

(2.47)

bu ,

(2.48)

27

valid for any j (x). from eqs. (2.46)-(2.48) we then calculate:

/d a

 = 2 ubf(cid:0)  ma + ma (cid:1)fbu .

hence the condition for a gaugino zero mode is the following two sets of linear constraints on
ma and ma which ensure that the right-hand side vanishes (expanding (x) as a + bx) [42]:

(2.50b)

in a formal sense discussed in ref. [41], these fermionic constraints are the spin- 1
2  super-
partners of the original spin-1 adhm constraints (2.15a) and (2.15b), respectively. note
further that eq. (2.50b) is easily solved when b is in the canonical form (2.19a). with the
adhm index decomposition (2.18), we set

(u+l) i = (cid:18) a

(2.52)

ii.6 classication and overlap formula for the fermion zero modes

let us classify these weyl spinor zero modes. two can be immediately distinguished, namely
those proportional to the adhm matrices a and b. we choose the following linear combina-
tions

i = 4b

i a
 ,

ma

i = 4b

i a

ma

and

i = 4 ai   a  4k1b
ma
 + 4k1b
ma
i = 4a 

i a

itrk(a ) a
itrk(a )a
 ,

(2.53a)

(2.53b)

where a
 and  a are arbitrary spinor parameters. these are the so-called supersymmetric
and superconformal zero modes,10 respectively [76]; they satisfy the fermionic constraints
(2.50a)-(2.50b) by virtue of the adhm constraints (2.15a)-(2.15b).

as for the remaining 8kn  16 modes, it is simplest to focus rst on the one-instanton
sector, k = 1, with the instanton oriented as in eqs. (2.35)-(2.38), and with  originally set to

10subtracting the trace terms in (2.53b), which amounts to an admixture of the supersymmetric mode,
corresponds to performing the superconformal transformation about the center of the multi-instanton, rather
than about the arbitrary origin of space-time.

28

unity. apart from the sixteen modes (2.53a)-(2.53b), there are 8n  16 additional fermionic
zero modes which are the superpartners to gauge orientations [23]. they are constructed
by setting ma = 0 and also a
u = 0 for u = n  1 or n, with arbitrary choices for a
for u  n  2; by inspection, these satisfy the constraints (2.50a)-(2.50b). turning on the
orientation matrix  as in eq. (2.40) simply rotates these choices of ma by .

u

next let us construct these modes for k > 1. our strategy is rst to consider the bosonic
gauge orientation modes, and then to act on them with supersymmetry. by denition, these
orientation modes must preserve all gauge-invariant combinations of the bosonic collective
coordinates contained in the matrix a. the (global) gauge dependence of a collective coordi-
nate is carried by the index u which transforms in the fundamental representation of su(n);
this index is attached to the submatrix w but not to the submatrix a (see eq. (2.19a)). a
natural set of gauge-invariant collective coordinates (used pervasively below) is obtained by
constructing bosonic bilinear variables w in which u is summed over:

(cid:0)w 

(cid:1)ij = w 

iu wuj  , w 0 = tr2 w, w c = tr2  cw, c = 1, 2, 3 .

(2.54)

by denition the innitesimal gauge orientation modes w are the ones which preserve all
the w s, i.e., which satisfy

w 

iuwuj  +  w 

iuwuj  = 0 .

(2.55)

now we consider the fermionic superpartners of these modes. under a supersymmetry trans-
formation one simply has [41]:

wui  = i aa

ui ,

 w 

iu = ia

iu

 
a .

inserting eq. (2.56) into eq. (2.55) produces the gauge-invariant conditions

 a w 

iua

uj +  

a a

iuwuj  = 0

or equivalently,

w 

iua

uj = 0 and a

iuwuj  = 0 .

to satisfy these constraints, it is convenient to decompose a as follows:

iu = wuj ( a)ji + a
a
iu,

where a lies in the orthogonal subspace to w:

iu = ( a
a

 )ij w 

uj + a

iu ,

w 

iua

uj = 0,

a
iuwuj  = 0 .

(2.56)

(2.57)

(2.58)

(2.59)

(2.60)

the superpartners of the bosonic coset coordinates are then precisely the variables {a, a}.11
11it is worth mentioning that although the coset coordinates correspond to bosonic zero modes which are

generated by lagrangian symmetries, this is not true of their fermionic partners.

29

now let us count the number of fermion modes of these various types.

it is easily
checked (see eq. (4.53) below) that the fermionic adhm constraint (2.50a) only involves
the {ma,  a,  a} modes, and not the {a, a} modes. our convention will be to use this
constraint to eliminate the  a in favor of the others. counting real independent grassmann
degrees of freedom, we thus nd 8k2 of the ma modes (which include the eight exact su-
persymmetric modes (2.53a)), 8k2 of the  a modes (which, linearly combined with the ma
modes, include the eight exact superconformal modes (2.53b)), and 8kn  16k2 of the a
modes, totaling 8kn. this is precisely as expected: one initially has 8k(n + 2k) real grass-
mann parameters in ma and ma, subject to 8k2 constraints from each of eqs. (2.50a) and
(2.50b), for a net of 8kn independent real gaugino zero modes.

finally, we will need the expression for the overlap of two adjoint fermion zero modes.
thanks to the adhm formalism, the space-time integration of the product of two classical
fermion elds can be equated to an ordinary trace over the product of the associated collective
coordinate matrices. the expression to be proved reads:

z d4x trn   = 

2
2

trk(cid:2) m(p + 1)n + n (p + 1)m(cid:3) .

here

p = lim

|x| p = 2  bb ,

(2.61)

(2.62)

as per eqs. (2.10) and (2.31), and m and n are the collective coordinate matrices corre-
sponding to  and , respectively.

the formula (2.61), attributed in ref. [73] to e. corrigan [77], is proved in a similar way
to the overlap formula for two bosonic vector zero modes presented in appendices b-c of [26].
the strategy of the proof is to show that the integrand is actually a total derivative,

trn   = 1

8 nn trk(cid:2) m(p + 1)n f + n (p + 1)mf(cid:3) ,

(2.63)

after which eq. (2.61) follows from gausss law, together with the asymptotic formulae of
sec. ii.3. to verify this, let us rst write out the left-hand side of eq. (2.63):12

trn   = tr(cid:2) ( npm + mpn )fbpbf + mpbf npbf + pmfbpn fb(cid:3). (2.64)

we have used the cyclicity of the trace, together with the denition (2.10) for the projector

12here, and in the following, the trace on the right-hand side is either over instanton or adhm indices,

depending on the context.

30

p. turning to the right-hand side of eq. (2.63), one calculates:

1

8nn tr(cid:2) m(p + 1)n f(cid:3) = 1

4tr(cid:2) 2 m{p, bfb}n f  2 m fbpbf  n f

here the expressions on the right-hand sides follow from the dierentiation formulae

np =  f n bp  pbn

 f   ,
nnp = 4{p, bfb}  4 fbpbf   ,

(2.66c)

together with the two alternate expressions in eq. (2.47); we have also invoked the relations
(2.50a), (2.50b) and (2.10) and, once again, cyclicity under the trace. from the nal rewrite
in eq. (2.65), the desired result (2.63) follows by inspection upon symmetrization in m and
n , qed.

ii.7 construction of the adjoint higgs bosons

in addition to the gauge eld vm and the four weyl spinors a
 , the n = 4 vector supermulti-
plet contains three complex scalars which likewise transform in the adjoint representation of
su(n). in n = 2 language, one of these three complex scalars comes from the n = 2 gauge
multiplet while the other two live in a single adjoint matter hypermultiplet. it is convenient
to assemble these three complex scalars into an adjoint-valued antisymmetric tensor eld
aab(x), endowed with the canonical kinetic energy

1

4abcdz d4x trn dnaabdnacd .

the antisymmetric eld is subject to a specic reality condition:

1

2abcdacd = (aab) ,

(2.67)

(2.68)

where  acts only on gauge indices, which implies that it transforms in the vector 6 repre-
sentation of so(6)r. we can transform to explicit vector components via

aab =

1
8

ab

a aa ,

(2.69)

where the coecients ab

a

are dened in the appendix.

31

in the leading semiclassical approximation, aab(x) is replaced by the solution of the

classical euler-lagrange equation

d2aab = 2 i [ a , b ] ,

(2.70)

where d2 is the covariant klein-gordon operator in the multi-instanton background, and a
is the adjoint fermion zero mode (2.46). the construction of the solution to this equation for
arbitrary higgs vevs is one of the principal technical results of refs. [26, 41]. here we will
content ourselves to summarize the solution in the exact conformal case of vanishing vevs.
one nds that aab has the additive form

i aab(x) =

1
22

u(cid:0)mbf ma  maf mb(cid:1)u + u (cid:18)0[n][n]

0[2k][n] aab

0[n][2k]

[k][k]  1[2][2](cid:19)  u .

(2.71)

the k  k anti-hermitian collective coordinate matrix aab is dened as the solution to the
inhomogeneous linear equation

(2.72)

(2.73)

here

ab =

l  aab = ab .

1

22 (cid:0) mamb  mbma(cid:1)

and l is a positive self-adjoint linear operator that maps the space of k  k scalar-valued
(anti-)hermitian matrices onto itself.13 explicitly, if  is such a matrix, then l is dened
as [26]

l   = 1
= 1

2{  , w 0 }  1
2{  , w 0 } + [an, [an, ]] ,

2 tr2(cid:0)[ a ,  ]a  a[ a ,  ](cid:1)

where w 0 is the hermitian k  k matrix
ij = w 

w 0

iu wuj  , w 0 = w 0

(2.74)

(2.75)

which we introduced in eq. (2.54). from eqs. (2.72)-(2.75) one sees that aab and ab
transform in the adjoint representation of the residual u(k) (2.22) (i.e., like a and ma).

dened in this way, the higgs eld aab(x) correctly satises the equation (2.70); see
sec. 7 of ref. [26] for calculational details. we also note that the constraints (2.15a), (2.15b),
(2.50a), (2.50b) and (2.72) may be thought of as the spin-1, spin- 1
2, and spin-0 com-
ponents of an n = 4 supermultiplet of constraints [43, 44].
13positivity of l follows from the hermiticity of a

n and the fact that w 0 is the product of a (non-square)

matrix with its hermitian conjugate: w 0 = w w .

32

iii construction of the multi-instanton action

having constructed the gauge, gaugino, and scalar components of the n = 4 superinstanton
in sec. ii, we now derive the k-instanton action sk
inst. the expression we will derive reads [44]:

sk

inst =

82k
g2  ik + sk

quad .

(3.1)

quad is a particular fermion quadrilinear term, with one fermion collective coordinate

here sk
chosen from each of the four gaugino sectors a = 1, 2, 3, 4 :

sk

quad =

2
g2 abcd trk abacd =

2
g2 abcd trk abl1cd ,

(3.2)

with l as in eq. (2.74). as an important consistency check, note that this expression does not
lift any of the sixteen exact supersymmetric and superconformal zero modes (2.53a)-(2.53b);
indeed, thanks to the constraints (2.50a)-(2.50b) these do not appear in ab. in contrast,
the remaining 8kn  16 fermionic modes do enter into sk
quad, and can therefore be lifted by
bringing down powers of the action from the exponent.

we know of three distinct derivations of eqs. (3.1)-(3.2). the rst, given in ref. [44],
is somewhat indirect, as it uses the supersymmetry properties of the collective coordinates;
the second, presented below, is more straightforward, albeit calculationally intensive.
in
ref. [44], we considered the n = 4 model with su(2) gauge group, on the coulomb branch
in which an adjoint higgs vev v breaks the gauge symmetry down to u(1). using methods
from previous work [26,43] we calculated the fermion bilinear terms in the k-instanton action;
they are proportional to either v or v. then we reasoned as follows. it is known that the
supersymmetry algebra can be implemented directly on the (unconstrained) multi-instanton
collective coordinates {a,ma} [43, 76]. physical quantities such as the multi-instanton col-
lective coordinate action should be a supersymmetric invariant. the fermion bilinear terms
calculated in ref. [44] can be shown not to form a supersymmetric invariant expression by
themselves. however, the unique addition of the quadrilinear term (3.2), taken together with
the bilinear terms, does produce a supersymmetric invariant expression. furthermore, in
the conformal limit v  0, only the quadrilinear term survives; in this limit it becomes a
supersymmetric invariant by itself. note that, without rst introducing the vev, we would
not have been able to x the overall multiplicative constant in front of sk
quad using super-
symmetry alone. note further that while the derivation detailed in ref. [44] was only for
the gauge group su(2), with the notational redenitions of [41] it immediately extends to
general su(n). an alternative derivation of the action will be presented in sec. iv.2 below
using d-brane methods.

here, instead, we will present a more straightforward derivation of the quadrilinear action
(3.2). our strategy is simply to plug the semiclassical expressions (2.8), (2.46) and (2.71)

33

for the gauge, gaugino and scalar elds into the n = 4 component lagrangian, and to carry
out the spatial integrations. such a direct approach might appear unpromising, since in
general the functional form of the gauge eld cannot be written down explicitly. (remember
that for k > 3 the nonlinear adhm constraints (2.20a) cannot be solved in closed form; see
eqs. (2.15a)-(2.15c) .) however, as in the n = 2 models considered in [26, 43, 78], it turns
out that the integrations can nevertheless be accomplished using gausss law, and that only
the asymptotic expressions (2.31) are actually needed. here are the details.

at leading semiclassical order, the relevant parts of the n = 4 component lagrangian

are the gauge, higgs and yukawa terms

s = sgauge + shiggs + syuk

1

= 

i

mn +

2g2z d4x trn v2

162z d4x trn vmn vmn
2 g2

1

+

i

abcdz d4x trn aab [c, d] .

(3.3)

as discussed at the opening of sec. ii, the other terms in the component lagrangian, involving
the antifermions , or the auxiliary components f and d, only turn on at higher order in
g2 and can be neglected for present purposes. the rst line in eq. (3.3) yields the usual
k-instanton contribution

sgauge = 2ik =

82k
g2  ik .

(3.4)

with an integration by parts together with the scalar equation of motion (2.70), the last two
terms may be rewritten as

shiggs + syuk = g21bcdz d4x(cid:0) n(trn a1bdnacd) + i2 trn 1[b, acd](cid:1) .

for deniteness we have singled out the supersymmetry index 1; alternatively this and
subsequent equations may be rewritten in a manifestly su(4)r invariant way. the rst term
here, being a total derivative, may be converted to a surface integral on the sphere at innity.
since it is gauge-invariant we can evaluate it in any convenient gauge. in particular, in the
instanton singular gauge dened in sec. ii.3 above, eqs. (2.31) and (2.71) imply that in the
limit |x|  

(3.5)

1
x2 ,
so that this surface contribution vanishes.

aab 

dnaab

(3.6)

we will now show that the commutator term in eq. (3.5) can likewise be rewritten as a
surface term. the general construction parallels that used in ref. [78] for deriving the fermion

34

quadrilinear in the simpler case of the n = 2 model coupled to fundamental hypermultiplets.
the basic idea is to construct quantities   and  such that

1

21bcd[b

  +  ,

where /d  = n

 dn, and  is itself an adjoint fermion zero mode of the form

()uv = u 

unifijb

juv  u 

u bi fij n 

j uv .

(3.7)

(3.8)

the collective coordinate matrix n (which will be seen to depend in a nontrivial way on the
original collective coordinates {a,ma}) is subject to the usual zero mode conditions from
sec. ii.5:

n 
i aj  = a
j = b
n 
i b

i  nj ,
i nj .

with the rewrite (3.7), the commutator term in eq. (3.5) becomes

22 iz d4x trn 1( /d 

  + ) = 22 iz d4x n(trn 1n

 )

 

(3.9a)

(3.9b)

(3.10)

+ 2 i2trk(cid:2) m1(p + 1)n + n (p + 1)m1(cid:3)

in the rst term we have used the fact that /d1 = 0 to pull the derivative outside the
trace, while in the second term we have invoked the zero mode overlap formula (2.61) (which
likewise follows from a surface integration). the reader can verify below a posteriori, using
the asymptotics of sec. ii.3, that 1  x3 and   x2; hence the rst term on the right-
hand side of eq. (3.10), like its higgs counterpart in eq. (3.5), gives a vanishing contribution
at innity and may be dropped. instead, it is the second term which is entirely responsible
for the nal answer (3.2).

let us return to eq. (3.7), and solve for   and . as usual in adhm calculus, some
educated guesswork is required. to this end we expand the left-hand side, using eqs. (2.46)
and (2.71):

here p is the projection operator dened in eq. (2.10) above. now, for an arbitrary quantity
of the type uj u, the chain-rule identity

/d (cid:0) uj u) = u ( / j )u + 2 ubf  j u + 2 uj  fbu

(3.12)

35

follows trivially from eq. (2.48). since n = bn, a comparison of eqs. (3.11) and (3.12)
motivates the ansatz:

(3.14b)

(3.14c)

 to account (more or less) for the rst line of eq. (3.11), and (2)

we expect (1)
 to account
(more or less) for the next line. the presence of (3)
 , while less obviously motivated at this
stage, will be needed to ensure that the quantity  dened in eq. (3.7) obeys the zero-mode
constraints (3.9a)-(3.9b).

by explicit calculation using eqs. (2.47), (2.50a), (2.50b), (3.12) and (3.14a), one nds:

(1)  =

0

(3.18)

where to obtain the nal equality we have decomposed  = a + xb, commuted xb through
g, and replaced it by a thanks to the orthogonality relation (2.6).

next we sum the expressions (3.15), (3.16) and (3.18), and compare to the right-hand
side of eq. (3.11). by inspection, we conrm the ansatze (3.7)-(3.8), where the grassmann
zero mode matrix has the form

n = 1

21bcd(cid:16) (cid:18)0

0 acd(cid:19)mb  mbacd(cid:17) + 2(cid:18)0

0

0

0 g (cid:19) a   2a g  .

(3.19)

up till this point we have yet to solve for g . this is accomplished by inserting n into the
fermionic constraints (3.9a)-(3.9b). one nds that eq. (3.9b) is satised automatically by the
expression (3.19). in contrast, eq. (3.9a) amounts to 2k2 independent real linear constraints,
which is precisely the number required to x the anti-hermitian kk matrices g  completely
(the explicit form for g  is not required).

finally we insert this expression for n into the nal term in eq. (3.10). thanks to the
constraints (2.50a)-(2.50b) on m1, the last two terms in eq. (3.19) do not contribute to the
inner product. it is easily checked, using the self-adjointness of l, that the rst two terms
in eq. (3.19) precisely reproduce the su(4)r invariant quadrilinear (3.2), as claimed.

iv the multi-instanton collective coordinate integra-

tion measure

in this section we present an in-depth discussion of the multi-instanton collective coordi-
nate measure. we begin with the so-called at measure, in which the various bosonic and
fermionic collective coordinates described in sec. ii are integrated over as cartesian vari-
ables; in the at measure, the adhm supermultiplet of constraints is implemented simply as
a product of -functions. section iv.1 reviews the eld-theory derivation of the at measure
given in refs. [41, 45, 79] using uniqueness arguments, whereas sec. iv.2 presents an inde-
pendent rederivation of the at measure directly from superstring theory by exploiting the
world-volume description of d-instantons in the presence of d3-branes.

however, the at measure is not optimal for our present purposes, for the following rea-
son. starting in sec. v we will explore how the adhm multi-instanton formalism combines

37

in a natural way with the large-n limit. unfortunately, for large n, the number of collective
coordinates contained in the matrices {a,ma} grows linearly with n. in order to imple-
ment a traditional saddle-point approach, it is desirable to change to a new set of collective
coordinates whose number stays xed as n grows. a strong clue for how to proceed comes
from anticipating sec. vi, where we nally calculate the correlators gn (n = 16, 8 or 4)
and related higher-partial-wave correlators, and put maldacenas conjecture to the test. a
common feature of these n-point functions is that the n insertions are all gauge-invariant
composite operators. this suggests that we change integration variables to a smaller set of
gauge-invariant collective coordinates. with this application in mind, sec. iv.3 is devoted
to the construction of the so-called gauge-invariant measure from the at measure. specif-
ically, this entails calculating the jacobians needed to switch from the original multiplet of
adhm variables, to the gauge-invariant bosonic and fermionic collective coordinates which
we have already identied in sec. ii.6. pleasingly, it turns out that after one integrates out
the gauge coset, the number of remaining gauge-invariant variables no longer grows with n,
but only grows with the topological number k.

iv.1 the adhm multi-instanton measure

we begin by reviewing the at measure on the space of adhm variables. as the small-
uctuations determinants in a self-dual background cancel between the bosonic and fermionic
sectors in a four-dimensional supersymmetric theory [80], the relevant measure is the one
inherited from the feynman path integral on changing variables from the elds to the col-
lective coordinates which parametrize the k-instanton moduli space mk
phys. in principle the
super-jacobian for this change of variables can be calculated by evaluating the normaliza-
tion matrices of the appropriate bosonic and fermionic zero-modes. in practice, this involves
resolving the adhm constraints and can only be accomplished explicitly for k  2.

instead, the heuristic strategy adopted in refs. [41, 45, 79] is to postulate a measure,
and to verify a posteriori that its form is xed uniquely by various consistency requirements
enumerated below. in particular, in the n = 4 supersymmetric theory, the measure has the
following form [41, 45]:

phys =

z dk
 yb=2,3,4

dk2

2k2/2(c1 )k

vol u(k) z d4k2
a1b yr=1,... ,k2h yc=1,2,3

a d2kn w d2kn w ya=1,2,3,4
2trk t r(tr2  caa)(cid:1) ya=1,2,3,4 y=1,2
(cid:0) 1

 yb=2,3,4

(cid:0)trk t r(l  a1b  1b)(cid:1)i .

d2k2ma dkn a dkn a

(cid:0)trk t r( maa  + a ma)(cid:1)

(4.1)

in writing the above, we have used a normalization for the integrations that is dierent, but

38

more convenient for our purposes, from that in [45]. this dierence accounts for the overall
factor of 2k2/2. the integrals over the k  k matrices an, ma and aab are dened as
the integral over the components with respect to a hermitian basis of k  k matrices t r
normalized so that trk t rt s = rs. these matrices also provide explicit denitions of the
-function factors in the way indicated. encoded in this measure is information about the
su(2) embedding of the instanton inside su(n); it is pleasing that the adhm parametriza-
tion replaces the traditional trigonometric variables of the coset matrix  describing this
embedding, by cartesian variables endowed with a at measure (apart from the -function
insertions).

we can oer the following consistency checks on this measure:

(i) in the 1-instanton sector, eq. (4.1) reduces to

c1

phys =

z d1
 yc=1,2,3

23/2 z d4a d2n w d2n w ya=1,2,3,4
2 tr2  c ww(cid:1) ya=1,2,3,4 y=1,2
(cid:0) 1

d2ma dn a dn a yb=2,3,4

da1b
(cid:0)l  a1b  1b(cid:1) .

(cid:0)aw  + w a(cid:1) yb=2,3,4

(4.2)

the rst -function is then resolved as per eqs. (2.33)-(2.34); also the third -function is trivial
since in the one-instanton sector l  22 as per eqs. (2.74), (2.75) and (2.33). in this way,
the bosonic part of eq. (4.2) precisely reproduces the standard one-instanton measure [70,81];
in particular, the position xn, size , and group iso-orientation  of the instanton follows
from the identications made in sec. ii.4 above. likewise, the fermionic collective coordinates
in eq. (4.2) can be identied with the supersymmetric and superconformal modes (2.53a)-
(2.53b), and with the superpartners of the iso-orientations zero modes discussed in sec. ii.6.
to summarize, in the one-instanton sector we have

det2w = 4 ,

detl  l = 22

 a = 4 a , ma

 = 4a
 .

(4.3)

after integrating over the global iso-orientation of the instanton (as we do for the multi-
instanton measure in sec. iv.3), the one-instanton measure is

phys =

22n69/22n2c1

(n  1)!(n  2)!z 4n13 d4x d ya=1,2,3,4

z d1
comparing this with the one-instanton bernard measure [81] suitably generalized to an n = 4
theory (see eq. (13) of ref. [40]14), we extract the normalization factor

d2a d2 a d(n2)a d(n2) a.

(4.4)

c1 = 22n +1/26n g4n

(4.5)

needed below.

14we have multiplied that result by 28 due to the dierence in conventions for integrating weyl fermions.

39

(ii) the k-instanton measure should be dimensionless, since the -function vanishes in
this n = 4 model. and indeed this is satised by the expression (4.1), since the engineering
length dimensions are [a] = [1b] = 1, [m] = 1/2, [dm] = 1/2, and [a1b] = 1.

(iii) if one inserts into the n = 4 measure (4.1) a mass term for (say) gauginos m3 and

m4, of the form

(4.6)
(see eq. (2.61)) and passes to the decoupling limit m   in the manner described in sec. 5
of ref. [45], the measure properly ows down to the n = 2 measure given in ref. [41].

exp im trn(cid:0) m4(p + 1)m3 + m3(p + 1)m4(cid:1) ,

(iv) the measure should preserve a net of 8kn unsaturated grassmann integrations at the
k-instanton level, in other words, 8kn exact fermion zero modes. it is easy to see that this
counting is obeyed by the right-hand side of eq. (4.1): 8k2 fermionic -functions saturate 8k2
out of the 8k2 + 8kn fermionic integrations over {ma, a, a}, leaving 8kn exact fermion
zero modes. while there is no index theorem in the n = 4 model guaranteeing this number,
due to the absence of a u(1) anomaly, the fact that this theory can be deformed into an
n = 2 model, where the anomaly exists, forces this nave counting nonetheless.

(v) the invariance of the measure (4.1) under the residual u(k) symmetry (2.22) is

obvious.

(vi) cluster decomposition in the dilute-gas limit of large space-time separation between
instantons xes the overall constant in the k-instanton measure (4.1) in terms of the one
instanton factor c1 . the derivation is analogous to that given in [41, 79].

(vii) as with all physically relevant quantities, the k-instanton measure has to be a super-
symmetric invariant. this important requirement can be directly checked by performing the
supersymmetry transformations on the collective coordinates detailed in ref. [41]. the key
point here is that the three -functions in eq. (4.1) represent the spin-1, spin- 1
2 and spin-0
adhm constraints (2.15a), (2.50a) and (2.72), respectively, which together form an n = 4
supermultiplet of constraints. note that in the nal -function in eq. (4.1) we have singled
out the supersymmetry index 1, so that, navely, the invariance is only guaranteed for su-
persymmetry transformations aqa + a qa with a = 1. however, since the a1b integration
is trivially accomplished using

z yb=2,3,4

dk2a1b yr=1,... ,k2 yb=2,3,4

(cid:0)trk t r(l  a1b  1b)(cid:1) =(cid:0)detk2l(cid:1)3

(4.7)

which is independent of the 1 direction, the expression (4.1) is actually invariant under all
four supersymmetries; i.e. it is su(4)r invariant.

(viii) finally we can make the following uniqueness argument [45]. since the -functions
in eq. (4.1) are dictated by the adhm formalism, and since the resulting measure turns

40

out to be a supersymmetric invariant and also preserves the correct number of fermion zero
modes, we claim that the ansatz (4.1) is in fact unique. to see why, let us consider including
an additional function of the collective coordinates, f (a,ma), in the integrand of eq. (4.1).
to preserve supersymmetry, we require that f be a supersymmetry invariant. it is a fact
that any non-constant function that is a supersymmetry invariant must contain fermion
bilinear pieces (and possibly higher powers of fermions as well). by the rules of grassmann
integration, such bilinears would necessarily lift some of the adjoint fermion zero modes
contained in the collective coordinate matrices ma. but since eq. (4.1) contains precisely
the right number of unlifted fermion zero modes as per (iv), this argument rules out the
existence of a non-constant function f . moreover, any constant f would be absorbed into
the overall multiplicative factor, which is already xed by cluster decomposition.

in the following subsection, we shall give an alternative, more direct, derivation of the
n = 4 measure (4.1), as well as the quadrilinear term (3.2), from string theory. (note that
the n = 2, n = 1 and (classical) n = 0 measures presented in [41, 45, 79] may in turn be
derived from the n = 4 measure, and thus ultimately from string theory, by renormalization
group decoupling; see item (iii) above and sec. 5 of [45].) but rst, we should note that
the results of the a1b integration, given by eq. (4.7), may be elegantly combined with
the quadrilinear action (3.2) derived in sec. iii, via the introduction of auxiliary gaussian
variables ab transforming in the vector 6 of so(6)r:

(detk2l)3 exp sk

quad = 3k2z d6k2

as in sec. ii.7, the antisymmetric tensor ab satises a pseudo-reality condition

in the so(6) representation the six k  k matrices a are hermitian. this kind of transfor-
mation is a well-known tool for analyzing the large-n limit of eld theories with four-fermion
interactions, like the gross-neveu and thirring models [51]. we shall nd that this transfor-
mation is absolutely crucial in our analysis, since it introduces a new set of bosonic collective
coordinates, namely a, which will have a very important role to play in the relation of the
yang-mills theory to the superstring theory.

iv.2 d-instantons and the adhm measure

in this section we will show that the n = 4 adhm measure of [45], described in sec. iv.1,
can actually be derived using d-brane techniques. we will consider n = 4 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory realized on the world-volume n d3-branes in type iib string theory.
according to [46, 47], d-instantons located on the d3-branes are equivalent to yang-mills
instantons in the world-volume gauge theory. in the following we determine the collective
coordinate measure for k d-instantons, dk
inst, in the presence of n d3-branes. in
a limit where the gauge theory on the d3-branes decouples from gravity, we nd that the
d-instanton measure coincides with our earlier results for the k-instanton adhm measure.
in this section, unlike the preceding one, we will not keep track of the overall normalization
of the measure.

phys expsk

we begin by briey reviewing some basic facts about d-branes in type ii string theory
[82]. a dp-brane is dened in the rst instance as a p-dimensional hyperplane in nine spatial
dimensions on which open strings can end. the massless states in the open string spectrum
give rise to massless elds which propagate on the p + 1 dimensional world-volume of the
d-brane. specically, the massless modes or collective coordinates of a single dp-brane come
from dimensional reduction to d = p + 1 of a u(1) vector multiplet of n = 1 supersymmetry
in d = 10. in contrast, closed string modes propagate in the ten dimensional bulk. after
dimensional reduction, the ten-dimensional gauge eld a,  = 0, 1, 2, . . . 9, yields a p + 1
dimensional gauge eld and 9 p real scalars. the scalars specify the location of the d-brane
in the 9  p dimensions transverse to its world-volume. the d = 10 multiplet also includes a
majorana-weyl fermion, . the sixteen independent components of  correspond to sixteen
fermion zero modes of the d-brane. this number reects the fact that the d-brane is a bps
conguration which breaks half of the 32 supersymmetries of the type ii theory.

when k parallel dp-branes are located at dierent points in their common transverse
dimensions their massless degrees of freedom are simply k copies of the collective coordinates
described above, which corresponds to gauge group u(1)k. however, when two or more
d-branes coincide, additional states corresponding to open strings stretched between the
two branes become massless leading to enhanced gauge symmetry [83].
in the maximal
case, where all k dp-branes coincide, the unbroken gauge group is u(k). the low-energy
eective action for the world-volume theory can be obtained from dimensional reduction of ten
dimensional super-yang-mills theory (sym10) with gauge group u(k). the ten-dimensional
action is,

where d =   i[a, ] is the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation and
f = a  a i[a, a] is the ten-dimensional eld strength. the -matrices obey the
ten-dimensional euclidean cliord algebra, {, } = 2. the particular representation

dimensional reduction to p + 1 dimensions proceeds by setting all spacetime derivatives
in the reduced directions to zero. as in the case of a single dp-brane, the ten dimensional
gauge eld yields a p + 1 dimensional gauge eld and 9  p real scalars, all in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group. congurations with some or all of the d-branes separated
in spacetime then correspond the coulomb branch of the world-volume gauge theory.
in
terms of string theory parameters, the yang-mills coupling constant in d = p + 1 is identied
as g2
p+1 = 2(2)p2e(p3)/2. this concludes the discussion of features which are common
to all dp-branes. the two cases which interest us most here are the d-instanton (p = 1)
and the d3 brane (along the way we will also meet the p = 5 and p = 9 cases). first of
all we recall that in the case of n parallel d3-branes the low-energy eective theory on the
brane world-volume is n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with gauge group u(n).
this conguration is the starting point for maldacenas analysis [2]. the dimensionless four-
dimensional gauge coupling is related to the string coupling as per eq. (1.1).
in general
the four-dimensional elds which propagate on the brane also have couplings to the ten-
dimensional graviton and the other closed string modes. to decouple the four-dimensional
theory from gravity it is necessary to take the limit   0.
in particular we will take
this limit with the string-coupling held xed and small. this gives a weakly coupled gauge
theory on the d3-brane. note that this limit is quite dierent from the large-n decoupling
limit considered by maldacena in which the d3-branes can reliably be described as classical
solutions of type iib supergravity. as emphasized in previous sections, maldacenas limit
leads instead to the strong coupling limit (g2n  1) of the four-dimensional gauge theory.
a d-instanton (or d(1)-brane) corresponds to the extreme case where the dimen-
sional reduction is complete and the world-volume is a single point in euclidean spacetime.
correspondingly, rather than nite mass or tension, a single d-instanton has nite action
scl = 2(e  ic(0)) where c(0) is the ramond-ramond scalar of the iib theory. as above,
the collective coordinates of a charge-k d-instanton correspond to a u(k) vector multiplet of
sym10. the diagonal components of the ten-dimensional gauge eld a specify the location
of k d-instantons in r10. as we dimensionally reduce to d = 0, these degrees of freedom are
c-numbers rather than elds. in addition to a constant part equal to kscl, the action of a
charge-k d-instanton also depends on the collective coordinates via the dimensional reduction
of (4.11),

sk =

where g0  ()2.

in addition to the manifest so(10) symmetry under ten-dimensional rotations, the action
is trivially invariant under translations of the form a  a + x1[k][k]. hence k1trk a,
which corresponds to the abelian factor of the u(k) gauge group, is identied with the center-

43

of-mass coordinate of the charge k d-instanton. the fermionic symmetries of the collective
coordinate action are,

a = i ,
 = [a, a] + 1[k][k]  ,

where  = i[, ]/4. the sixteen components of the majorana-weyl so(10) spinor
 correspond to the sixteen zero modes of the d-instanton conguration generated by the
action of the d = 10 supercharges. like the bosonic translation modes, these modes live
in the abelian factor of the corresponding u(k) eld, k1trk . in contrast, the majorana-
weyl spinor  parametrizes the sixteen supersymmetries left unbroken by the d-instanton.
these are analogous to the collective coordinate supersymmetries of the adhm formalism
described in [43].

in ordinary eld theory, instantons yield non-perturbative corrections to correlation func-
tions via their saddle-point contribution to the euclidean path integral. in the semiclassical
limit, the path-integral in each topological sector reduces to an ordinary integral over the in-
stanton moduli space. the extent to which similar ideas apply to d-instantons is less clear, in
part because string theory lacks a second-quantized formalism analogous to the path integral.
despite this, there is considerable evidence that d-instanton contributions to string-theory
amplitudes also reduce to integrals over collective coordinates at weak string coupling [36].
in this case the relevant collective coordinates are the components the ten-dimensional u(k)
gauge eld a and their superpartners . according to green and gutperle [36], the charge-
k d-instanton contributions to the low-energy correlators of the iib theory are governed by
the partition function,

zk =

d10a d16 expsk .

(4.13)

vol u(k) zu (k)

this partition function can be thought of as the collective coordinate integration measure
for k d-instantons. in particular, the leading semiclassical contribution of k d-instantons
to the correlators of the low-energy supergravity elds is obtained by inserting the classical
value of each eld in the integrand of (4.13). because of the symmetries described above,
the collective coordinate action sk does not depend on the u(1) components of the elds a
and . hence, to obtain a non-zero answer, the inserted elds must include at least sixteen
fermions to saturate the corresponding grassmann integrations. as in eld theory instanton
calculations, the resulting amplitudes can be interpreted in terms of an instanton-induced
vertex in the low-energy eective action. the spacetime position of the d-instanton, x, is
interpreted as the location of the vertex. in particular, the work of green and gutperle [36]
has focused on a term of the form r4 in the iib eective action (here r is the ten-dimensional
curvature tensor) and its supersymmetric completion.

so far, we have only considered d-instantons in the iib theory in a at ten dimen-
sional background and in the absence of other branes. in order to make contact with four-
dimensional gauge theory we need to understand how these ideas apply to d-instantons in

44

the presence of d3-branes. in particular we wish to determine how the d-instanton measure
(4.13) is modied by the introduction of n parallel d3-branes. conversely, in the absence of
d-instantons, the theory on the four-dimensional world volume of the d3-branes is n = 4
u(n) super yang-mills theory. hence a related question is how the d-instantons appear
from the point of view of the four-dimensional theory on the d3 branes. in fact, the brane
conguration considered here is a special case of a system which has been studied intensively
in the past. the general case involves a conguration of k dp-branes in the presence of n
d(p + 4)-branes, with all branes parallel. as we will review below, in each of these cases the
lower-dimensional brane corresponds to a yang-mills instanton in the world-volume gauge
theory of the higher [47]. we begin by reviewing the maximal case p = 5, which was rst
considered (in the context of type i string theory) by witten [48]. the cases with p < 5
then follow straightforwardly by dimensional reduction.

we start by considering a theory of k parallel d5-branes in isolation. as above, the world-
volume theory is obtained by dimensional reduction of ten dimensional n = 1 super-yang-
mills theory with gauge group u(k). the resulting theory in six dimensions has two weyl
supercharges of opposite chirality and is conventionally denoted as n = (1, 1) sym.15 after
dimensional reduction, the so(10) lorentz group of the euclidean theory in ten dimensions is
broken to h = so(6) so(4). the so(6) factor is the lorentz group of the six dimensional
theory while the so(4) is an r-symmetry. the ten dimensional gauge eld a splits up into
an adjoint scalar a in the vector representation of so(4) and a six dimensional gauge eld
a with a = 1, . . . , 6. explicitly we set a = (an, a) where n = 0, 1, 2, 3 is an so(4) vector
index.

in order to describe the fermion content of the theory we will consider the covering
group of h, h = su(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r. we introduce indices a = 1, 2, 3, 4 and
,  = 1, 2 corresponding to each factor. as mentioned above, a ten dimensional majorana-
weyl spinor can be decomposed into two weyl spinors of opposite chirality in six dimensions.
the corresponding representation of so(10) decomposes as,

16  (4, 2, 1)  (4, 1, 2)

(4.14)

under h. an explicit decomposition of the ten-dimensional spinor  in terms of the six
dimensional spinors, ma
 and  a is given in the appendix. as in the previous sections
of this paper, it will often be convenient to rewrite the so(6) vector a as a (quasi-real)
antisymmetric tensor ab using eq. (4.10), where ab is subject to the reality condition
(4.9).

in the above, we have rescaled the elds so that the six-dimensional coupling constant,
g2
6  , only appears in front of the action of the n = (1, 1) vector multiplet. the reason for
the unconventional normalization of the fermion kinetic terms will become apparent below.
for later convenience we have also introduced an real anti-self dual auxiliary eld for the
vector multiplet, dmn = (dmn). d transforms in the adjoint representation of su(2)r,
which can be made explicit by writing dmn = dc c
mn, where the eta symbol is dened in
the appendix.

following [47], he next step is to introduce n d9-branes of the type iib theory whose
world-volume lls the ten dimensional spacetime.16 these are analogous to the n d3-branes
in the p = 1 case on which we will eventually focus. the world volume theory of the
d9-branes in isolation (i.e. in the absence of the d5-branes) is simply ten dimensional u(n)
supersymmetric yang-mills. as explained by douglas [47], the eective action for this system
contains a coupling between the eld strength vmn of the world-volume gauge eld and the
the rank six antisymmetric tensor eld c which comes from the ramond-ramond sector
of the type iib theory. the latter eld is dual to the three-form eld strength which appears
in the type iib supergravity action. this coupling has the form,

z c  v  v,

(4.18)

where c and v are written as a six-form and a two-form respectively and the integration is
over the ten-dimensional world volume of the d9-branes. the same six-form eld also couples
minimally to the ramond-ramond charge carried by d5-branes. hence a conguration of
the u(n) gauge elds with non-zero second chern class, v  v , acts as a source for d5-
brane charge. more concretely, if the d9-brane gauge eld is chosen to be independent of six
of the world-volume dimensions and an ordinary yang-mills instanton is embedded in the

16in fact a iib background with non-vanishing d9-brane charge suers from inconsistencies at the quantum
level. this is not relevant here because the d9-branes in question are just a starting point for a classical
dimensional reduction.

46

remaining four dimensions, then the resulting conguration has the same charge-density as a
single d5-brane. both objects are also bps saturated and therefore they also have the same
tension. further conrmation of the identication of d5-branes on a d9-brane as instantons
was found in [47] where the gauge-eld background due to a type i d5-brane was shown to
be self-dual via its coupling to the world-volume of a d1-brane probe.

as described above, d5-branes appear as bps saturated instanton congurations on the
d9-brane which break half of the supersymmetries of the world-volume theory. conversely,
the presence of d9-branes also break half the supersymmetries of the d5-brane world-volume
theory described by the action (4.15). specically, the n = (1, 1) supersymmetry of the six-
dimensional theory is broken down to the n = (0, 1) subalgebra described above equation
(4.15). to explain how this happens we recall that open strings stretched between branes give
rise to elds which propagate on the d-brane world-volume. so far we have only included the
adjoint representation elds which arise from strings stretching between pairs of d5-branes.
as our conguration now includes both d5- and d9-branes there is the additional possibility
of states corresponding to strings with one end on each of the two dierent types of brane.
as the d5-brane and d9-brane ends of the string carry u(k) and u(n) chan-paton indices
respectively, the resulting states transform in the (k, n ) representation of u(k)  u(n).

in fact the additional degrees of freedom comprise kn hypermultiplets of n = (0, 1)
supersymmetry in six dimensions [48]. as these hypermultiplets cannot be combined to form
multiplets of n = (1, 1) supersymmetry, the residual supersymmetry of the six dimensional
theory is n = (0, 1) as claimed above. each hypermultiplet contains two complex scalars
wui . here, as previously, i and u are fundamental representation indices of u(k) and u(n)
respectively. the fact that hypermultiplet scalars transform as doublets of the su(2) r-
symmetry is familiar from n = 2 theories in four dimensions. each hypermultiplet also
contains a pair of complex weyl spinors, a
iu. the six-dimensional action for the
hypermultiplets is,

table 1: transformation properties of the elds

the reader will have noticed that we have chosen our notation so that each six-dimensional
eld has a counterpart, denoted by the same letter, in our discussion of the adhm construc-
tion in section iii. the only exceptions are the elds  and d whose signicance will be

48

explained below. also the group indices on each d = 6 eld are in one-to-one correspondence
with those on the adhm variable of the same name. the physical reason for this correspon-
dence is simple: the six dimensional elds are the collective coordinates of the d5-branes.
as the d5-branes are equivalent to the yang-mills instantons, the vacuum moduli space of
the u(k) gauge theory on the d5-branes should coincide with the k-instanton moduli space
described by the adhm construction. as the only scalar elds in the six-dimensional theory
lie in n = (0, 1) hypermultiplets, the relevant vacuum moduli space is conventionally referred
to as a higgs branch. precisely how the proposed equivalence arises was explained in [48]
where it was shown that the d-term vacuum conditions which follow from the six-dimensional
action coincide with the non-linear constraint equations of the adhm construction. this
and several new aspects of this correspondence will be demonstrated explicitly below.

starting from the conguration of d5 and d9-branes described above, the general case
of parallel dp- and d(p + 4)-branes with p < 5 can be obtained by dimensional reduction
on the brane world-volumes. in particular the case of d0- and d4-branes in the type iia
theory has been studied extensively because of its application as a lightcone matrix model of
the (2, 0) theory in six dimensions [86]. in this case we will perform one further dimensional
reduction and study k d-instantons in the presence of n d3-branes. following the above
discussion, this corresponds to k yang-mills instantons in the four-dimensional n = 4 theory.
the symmetry group u(k)  u(n)  h of the six dimensional system now has a simple
interpretation in terms of the four-dimensional theory: u(k) is the internal symmetry of
the adhm construction, u(n) is the gauge group, su(4) is the r-symmetry group of the
n = 4 supersymmetry algebra and so(4) = su(2)l  su(2)r is the four-dimensional
lorentz group. in six dimensions the scalar elds were all in n = (0, 1) hypermultiplets, and
hence the resulting vacuum moduli space was a higgs branch. after dimensional reduction
to d = 0, the six-dimensional gauge elds a become scalars which can acquire vevs. the
resulting coulomb branch corresponds to motion of the d-instantons in the six dimensions
transverse to the d3-branes. we will see below that a is just the auxiliary eld introduced
at the end of sec. iv.1 to bilinearize the four-fermion term in the instanton action.

we will now write down the collective-coordinate measure which determines the leading
semiclassical contribution of k d-instantons to correlation functions of the low-energy elds
of the iib theory in the presence of n d3-branes. from the above discussion, the appropriate
generalization of (4.13), is obtained by dimensionally reducing the partition function of the
six-dimensional theory with action g2
matter dened in (4.16), (4.17) and
(4.19) to zero dimensions. thus we have,

note that sg arises from dimensional reduction of sgauge and sk +sd comes from dimensional
reduction of s(a)

of the hypermultiplets, while sd contains the yukawa couplings and d-terms.

matter + s(f)

semiclassical correlation functions of the light elds can be calculated by replacing each
eld with its value in the d-instanton background and performing the collective coordinate
integrations with measure (4.23). in the case of the low-energy gauge elds on the d3-brane,
the relevant classical conguration is simply the charge-k yang-mills instanton specied by
the adhm data which appears explicitly in the action (4.24a)-(4.24c). note that the measure
(4.23) depends explicitly on the string length-scale through the zero-dimensional coupling
0  ()2 which appears in the action. as a consequence correlation functions which
g2
include elds inserted at distinct spacetime points xi and xj will have a non-trivial expansion
in powers of /|xi  xj|. in order to decouple the world-volume gauge theory from gravity
must take the limit   0. hence we take the strong coupling limit g2
0  , in the exponent
of (4.23).17 our nal answer for the modied d-instanton measure is therefore,

zk,n =

1

vol u(k) z d6d8d3d d4a d8m d4w d4 d4  exp (sk  sd) .

(4.25)

as mentioned above, we have not kept track of the overall normalization of this expression
which includes a numerical constant that depends on k and n as well as some power of the
four-dimensional gauge coupling.

we can now make contact with our results for the adhm measure in sec. iv.1.18

in
particular, the equation of motion for d is precisely the non-linear adhm constraint (2.20a).
similarly the equation of motion for  is the fermionic constraint (2.50a). integration over
these variables yields the rst two sets of -functions in the measure formula (4.1). further,
sk can be compactly rewritten in the notation of sec. iv.1 as,

sk = trk ala  4itrk abab .

(4.26)

this is equal to (minus) the exponent appearing in equation (4.8). on integrating out the
gauge eld a, the instanton action reduces to the fermion quadrilinear term (3.2). we
have therefore reproduced our result for the adhm measure, up to an overall normalization
constant. in addition the action sk + sd is invariant under eight supercharges which are

17see page 4 of [86] for the corresponding discussion in the p = 0 case.
18the dierence between the gauge groups u (n ) and su (n ) is irrelevant in this context because the

instantons always live in the nonabelian factor.

inherited from the n = (0, 1) theory in six dimensions. the resulting supersymmetry trans-
formations are identical to the collective coordinate supersymmetries of the n = 4 adhm
measure given in [45] (suitably generalized for gauge group u(n) as in [41]). there are also
eight additional fermionic symmetries which only appear after taking the decoupling limit
  0. these correspond to the half of the superconformal transformations of the n = 4
theory which leave the instanton invariant.

it is interesting to compare the above discussion of d-instantons in the presence of d3-
branes with the corresponding results for the dp/d(p + 4) system with p > 0.
in the
p = 0 case considered in [86], we have d0-branes which correspond to solitons in the 4 +
1 dimensional gauge theory on the d4-brane world-volume. these solitons are just four-
dimensional yang-mills instantons thought of as static nite-energy congurations in ve
dimensions. at weak coupling, we expect the dynamics of these solitons to be correctly
described by supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the instanton moduli space. hence,
it is not surprising that precisely this quantum mechanical system is obtained in [86] by
dimensionally reducing the six-dimensional n = (0, 1) theory described above down to a
single time dimension. on adding another world-volume dimension, we obtain the d1/d5
system discussed by witten in [87]. the d1-branes are now strings in a six dimensional
yang-mills theory and, in the decoupling limit, their world-sheet dynamics is described by
a two-dimensional n = (4, 4) non-linear -model with the adhm moduli space as the
target manifold. this -model has kinetic terms for the coordinates on the target and their
superpartners and as usual the supersymmetric completion of the action involves a four-
fermion term which couples to the riemann tensor of the target. if we reduce this action
back to d = 1 by discarding spatial derivatives we obtain the quantum mechanics of [86]. if
we then reduce to d = 0 by discarding time derivatives also, the only term of the -model
action which survives is the four-fermion term. this is the origin of the fermion quadrilinear
term (3.2) in the collective coordinate action.

iv.3 the gauge-invariant measure

in secs. iv.1-iv.2 we have presented eld-theory and string-theory derivations of the at
measure, eq. (4.1). however, as stated earlier, this form of the measure is inadequate to our
present purposes, for two reasons:

(i) the number of bosonic and fermionic variables grows with n. such a growth is
inconvenient in light of our stated aim, in sec. v below, to treat the large-n limit in a
traditional saddle-point approximation.

(ii) the collective coordinates w and a carry a u index which transforms in the funda-
mental representation of the (global) su(n) gauge group. in other words, they do not dene

51

a gauge-invariant set of variables. this is inecient, given that in sec. vi below, we intend
to evaluate only correlators of gauge-invariant operators.

accordingly, our present task is to change variables from w and a to the gauge-invariant
set of collective coordinates already introduced in sec. ii.6. after integrating out the degrees
of freedom corresponding to the gauge coset19

su(n)

su(n  2k)

,

(4.27)

we will nd that the number of remaining integration variables no longer grows with n,
but only with k. the main calculational aim of this subsection is to derive the bosonic and
fermionic jacobians associated with these changes of variables. the reader who is uninter-
ested in the details of our algebra can skip directly to our nal result for the gauge-invariant
measure given in eq. (4.55) below. note that this expression incorporates the auxiliary
gaussian variables a introduced in eqs. (4.8)-(4.10).

we begin the jacobian calculation in the bosonic sector where we need to change variables
from the collective coordinates wui , whose u index transforms in the fundamental represen-
tation of the gauge group su(n), to the gauge-invariant bilinear variables (w 
)ij dened

in eq. (2.75).

let us consider the more general mathematical problem of an n k dimensional complex
matrix vl
u where u = 1, . . . , n and l = 1, . . . , k, and let us always assume n  k (which is
appropriate for the large-n limit to follow). in the case at hand, l stands for the composite
index (i, ) and so

k = 2k , n  2k ,

(4.28)

where k is the topological number as always. furthermore we assume that these variables
(read: the ws) are endowed with a at integration measure

dv =

n

k

yu=1

yl=1

u dvlu .

(4.29)

a suitable su(n) gauge transformation  puts the matrix vl

u into upper-triangular
19actually physical gauge transformations involve modding out by an additional u (1) corresponding to
overall phase rotations since these transformations lie in the auxiliary group u (k). however, we shall loosely
refer to (4.27) as the gauge coset.

k are complex except for the diagonal elements l

l which we can choose to be real. the
group parameters x coordinatize the coset su(n)/su(n  k) which acts non-trivially on
the  matrix; the index x runs over 1, . . . , xmax where

xmax = 2kn  k 2 .

(4.31)

obviously the number of independent real parameters, namely 2kn, is the same on both
sides of eq. (4.30).

while a priori the k

l are only dened for l  k  k, it is convenient to extend them to
k). in terms of these extended variables we dene the

(4.33)

we wish to calculate the jacobian induced by changing integration variables from the
original collective coordinates vl
u, to the gauge-invariant bilinears wkl together with the coset
parameters x. it is useful to pass through an intermediate change of variables involving the
l
k rather than the wkl. the desired jacobian can then be expressed as a quotient:

(cid:0){vl
u, vlu }(cid:1)
(cid:0){wkl, x}(cid:1)

=

l , x}(cid:1)(cid:30) (cid:0){wkl}(cid:1)
(cid:0){vl
u, vlu }(cid:1)
l }(cid:1)
(cid:0){k
(cid:0){k

.

(4.34)

what we aim to show is that this jacobian actually factors cleanly into a function of the
gauge-invariant parameters wkl, times a function of the coset variables x; integrating over

53

the gauge coset then turns the latter function into some overall normalization constant that
we will evaluate explicitly.

to this end, let us analyze, in turn, the denominator and the numerator on the right-hand
side of eq. (4.34). the denominator is readily evaluated from eq. (4.32) by induction in k.
for k = 1 one has simply w11/1
1 = 21

jacobian for k to that for k  1; one nds

(4.36)

next, we evaluate the numerator on the right-hand side of eq. (4.34). at this stage, it is
useful to make an explicit choice of coset coordinates x. we choose them to be simply the
independent entries of the rst k orthonormal columns ul of :

ul
u = ul ,

ul  ul

= ll

.

(4.37)

the n-vectors ul then provide the well-known parametrization of the coset as a product
of spheres [88]. to see this, u1 is a unit vector in an n-dimensional complex space and
consequently parametrizes s2n1. the second vector u2 is a similar unit vector, but one
which is orthogonal to u1, and consequently parameterizes s2n3. continuing this chain of
argument, we see that the vectors {ul} parametrize the product of spheres

su(n)

su(n  k)  s2n1  s2n3      s2n2k+1 .

from (4.30) we can read o the expansion of the vectors vl in terms of this basis:

vl =

l

xk=1

kuk .
l

(4.38)

(4.39)

the numerator on the right-hand side of eq. (4.34) can be determined through the following
iterative process. first we start with v1 = 1
1u1, whose measure can be written in polar
coordinates as

dv1

udv1u = 2n (1

1)2n1 d1

1 d2n1 1 .

(4.40)

n

54

here d2n1 1 is the usual measure for the solid angles on s2n1 parametrized by u1. con-
tinuing the process on the next vector v2 = 2

1u1 + 2

2u2, we have

n

in general

udv2u = d2

where l is parametrized by ul. hence

(4.42)

dv =2n kk(k1)/2(1

 d2n1 1 d2n3 2    d2n2k+1 k .

using eqs. (4.33), (4.34), (4.36) and (4.43), we therefore obtain

dv = 2n kk(k+1)/2(detkw )nk dk 2

w d2n1 1 d2n3 2    d2n2k+1 k .

(4.44)

thus, when this measure is used to integrate only gauge-invariant quantities, as we shall
do in sec. vi, then only the det w piece survives; the remaining terms are integrated over
the gauge coset to give an overall normalization constant reecting the volume of the coset
(4.27). re-introducing k = k/2 and the vectors w, we state our nal result as

z gauge

coset

d2kn w d2kn w = ck,n (det2kw )n2k dk2

w c .

(4.45)

w 0 yc=1,2,3

the integral over the 2k  2k matrix w has been written as four separate integrals over the
k  k matrices w 0 and w c, dened in (2.54), with respect to the basis t r, dened below
(4.1).20 the normalization constant is precisely

i=1(n  i)!

(4.46)

in changing variables from the ws to the w s, one must also, of course, specify the
integration domain for the latter. since these variables are the inner products of vectors they
will be constrained by various triangle inequalities. fortunately, these technicalities will not
be important for us, the reason being that the saddle-point values of the w s obtained in
sec. 5.2 satisfy all such triangle inequalities by inspection.

20this accounts for an additional factor of 22k2

.

55

we now turn to the fermionic sector. as explained in sec. ii.6, the fermionic equivalent
of integrating out the gauge coset is to integrate out the grassmann variables a and a
dened in eqs. (2.59)-(2.60). since these coordinates are orthogonal to the w and w vectors,
respectively, it is easy to see from (2.50a) that they do not appear in the fermionic adhm
constraints; however, they do appear in the fermion quadrilinear term (3.2). the jacobian
for the change of variables from the original fermionic coordinates {a, a} to the variables
of sec. ii.6, namely { a,  a, a, a}, is, for each value of a,21

(cid:0){a, a}(cid:1)
(cid:0){ a,  a, a, a}(cid:1)

= (det2k w )k .

(4.47)

in order to integrate out the a and a variables it is useful to split the fermion bilinear

(2.73) that couples to ab in (4.8) as

ab = ab + ab,

where the rst term has components just depending on {a, a}:

and the second term depends on the remaining variables

ab

we can now explicitly integrate out the as and as:

(4.51)

where the determinant is of (ab)ij viewed as a 4k  4k matrix.

actually, going to a gauge invariant measure carries with it a very signicant advantage:
in the bosonic sector, one notices

we can integrate out the adhm -functions explicitly.
that the adhm constraints are written as

0 = w c + [ an , am ] tr2  cnm = w c  i[ an , am ] c

nm .

(4.52)

in terms of the gauge invariant coordinates. notice that they are linear in w c and conse-
quently the w c integrals simply remove the bosonic adhm -functions in (4.1) (giving rise
to the numerical factor of 23k2 from the 1
2s in the arguments of the -functions). there is

(4.54)

notice that the factor on the right-hand side conveniently cancels the jacobian of (4.47).

putting everything together we now have a much simpler form for the measure for inte-

grating gauge invariant quantities:

(4.55)

in particular, since the number of integration variables no longer grows with n (in con-
tradistinction to the at measure), this expression is immediately amenable to a large-n
saddle-point analysis, to which we now turn.

v the large-n limit in a saddle-point approximation

v.1 the one-instanton measure revisited, and the emergence of

the s5

as a prelude to the technically demanding case of multi-instantons, it is instructive to revisit
the one-instanton sector, and in particular, to derive the result (1.26) cited in sec. i.3 above
[40]. in this simple setting, we will formulate a large-n saddle-point method which naturally
extends to k > 1, and we will already see the emergence of the s5 factor expected from the
ads/cft correspondence.

consider the gauge invariant measure (4.55) for k = 1. in this case we can greatly simplify

the expression: in addition to the relations (4.3) one has ab = 0, and also [40]

the rst equality in eq. (5.1) is a well-known factorization property of 4  4 antisymmet-
ric matrices, while the second equality involves the so(6) rewrite (4.10). introducing six-
dimensional polar coordinates a = {r, }, one then nds for the measure:

(5.3)

from eqs. (5.2)-(5.3) one sees that the xn and  integrations assemble into the scale-invariant
ads5 volume form d4x d 5. moreover we can perform the integration over , yielding
vol s5 = 3, to recapture the numerical factor cn quoted in eq. (1.26) (where the remaining
powers of two come from the factors of 96 associated to each of the operator insertions).

equations (5.2)-(5.3) are the principal result of [40], and, we stress, are exact for all n.
however, this exactness can be traced to the factorization property (5.1), which is special to
the one-instanton sector. in order to generalize the above to k > 1, at least in the large-n
limit, it is important to reproduce these results in an alternative way, using saddle-point
methods. to this end, note that the integral in is nothing but a gamma function. for large
n it is well approximated by stirlings formula, which, the reader will recall, is derived as

follows. first one rescales r  nr, or equivalently
n a ,

a 

so that n factors out of the exponent. the integral then becomes

in = n 2n1z 

0

dr r3 e2n (log r22r2) ,

(5.4)

(5.5)

which is in a form amenable to a standard saddle-point evaluation. the saddle-point is at
r = 1 and, to leading order, a gaussian integral around the solution gives

lim
n

in = 24n n 2n1e2nr 

n

,

(5.6)

which is valid up to 1/n corrections.

while this is all very elementary, we have uncovered something truly surprising. a single
yang-mills instanton in an n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory is eectively parametrized at
large n by its position xn, scale size , and a point  on s5 (as well as the sixteen fermionic
collective coordinates). notice that this parametrization only emerges in the large-n limit
where the solution of the saddle-point equations identies the radius of the sphere with the

58

inverse of the instanton scale size; i.e. the radius of the sphere with the radial variable of ads5.
these parameters are precisely the coordinates required to specify the position of an object
in the ten-dimensional space ads5  s5, where 1 is a radial coordinate on the ads5. given
maldacenas conjectured correspondence between correlation functions in the supergravity
theory in ten dimensions and the four-dimensional gauge theory on its boundary, this leads
us to identify a large-n yang-mills instanton with a (singly-charged) d-instanton. in this
identication, the sixteen supersymmetric and superconformal zero-modes of the yang-mills
 ,  a} are identied with the sixteen supersymmetries of the type iib string
instanton {a
theory broken by the d-instanton denoted  in eq. (1.7).

v.2 navely the k-instanton moduli space contains k copies of

ads5  s5

we now turn to the case of general topological number k. for k > 1 one quickly abandons
any hope of performing the integrations in eq. (4.55) exactly.
instead, let us extend the
large-n saddle-point treatment developed in sec. v.1. as in the one-instanton sector, we
rst perform the rescaling (5.4). the gauge-invariant measure (4.55) then becomes:

(5.7)

here, in anticipation of the large-n limit, we have already applied stirlings formula to the
numerical prefactor (4.46). we have also introduced the eective k-instanton action se
in which all the terms which scale with n are collected:22

se = 2k(1 + 3 log 2)  log det2kw  log det4k + trk ala .

(5.8)

this expression involves the 11k2 bosonic variables comprising the eleven independent k  k
hermitian matrices w 0, an and a. the remaining components w c, c = 1, 2, 3, are eliminated
in favor of the an via the adhm constraint (4.52). the action is invariant under the u(k)
symmetry (2.23) which acts by adjoint action on all the variables.

with n factored out of the exponent, the measure is in a form which is amenable to a

saddle-point treatment as n  . the coupled saddle-point equations read:

abcd (l  ab) ce = 1
aa = 1

[a, [a, an]] = ic

2 d
e 1[k][k] ,
2 (w 1)0 ,
nm[am, (w 1)c] .

(5.9a)

(5.9b)

(5.9c)

22as previously, we translate back and forth as convenient between the antisymmetric tensor representation

ab and the so(6)r vector representation a, a = 1, . . . , 6 (4.10).

59

these are obtained by varying se with respect to the matrix elements of , w 0 and an,
respectively, and rewriting log det as tr log. we have employed the k  k matrices

(w 1)0 = tr2 w 1,

(w 1)c = tr2  cw 1.

(5.10)

the general solution to these coupled saddle-point equations is easily found. it has the

simple property that all the quantities are diagonal in instanton indices,

w 0 = diag(cid:0)22
a = diag(cid:0)1
an = diag(cid:0)  x 1

a simple picture of this leading-order saddle-point solution emerges:

it can be thought
of as k independent copies of the one-instanton saddle-point solution described in sec. v.1,
a) on ads5  s5. additional
where the ith instanton is parametrized by a point (x i
insight into this solution emerges from considering the su(2) generators (tc
i )uv describing
the embedding of the ith instanton inside su(n). from eqs. (2.44c), (2.54) and (5.11a) one
derives the commutation relations

n, i, i

[ ta

i , tb

j ] = 2iij abc tc
i

(5.13)

so that at the saddle-point, thanks to the kronecker-, the k individual instantons lie in k
mutually commuting su(2) subgroups. actually this feature follows from large-n statistics
alone,23 and has nothing to do with either the existence of supersymmetry or with the details
of the adhm construction; nevertheless the fact that eq. (5.13) emerges from the saddle-
point equations is a reassuring check on our formalism. in this one particular respect, the
solution (5.11a)-(5.11c) can be said to be dilute-gas-like. another important property is that
the eective action (5.8) evaluated on these saddle-point solutions is zero; hence there is no
exponential dependence on n in the nal result. finally we should make the technical point
that, thanks to the diagonal structure of these solutions, they are automatically consistent
with the triangle inequalities on the boson bilinear w discussed in the paragraph following
eq. (4.46); hence we never need to specify more explicitly the integration limits on the w
variables.

23consider the analogous problem of k randomly oriented vectors in rn in the limit n  ; clearly the

dot products of these vectors tend to zero simply due to statistics.

60

we are now squarely faced with the puzzle described in sec. i: the fact that we have
obtained k copies of ads5  s5 ostensibly contradicts the supergravity side of the ads/cft
correspondence, where only one copy of this moduli space appears at each topological level
k (e.g., see the supergravity expression (1.15) for the correlator g16). in the following sub-
section we show that this k-fold degeneracy is lifted when one considers small uctuations
in the neighborhood of the generic solution (5.11a)-(5.11c), and that the yang-mills multi-
instanton moduli space indeed collapses to a single copy, precisely as dictated by maldacenas
conjecture.

v.3 the exact k-instanton moduli space collapses to one copy of

ads5  s5

let us repeat some general lore about saddle-point methods. in order to evaluate a multi-
dimensional integral in saddle-point approximation, it never suces merely to identify the
space of saddle-point solution(s). one must also evaluate the leading non-vanishing small-
uctuations integral in the background of the solution(s). typically this small-uctuations
integral is gaussian, and produces a prefactor proportional to (det m)1/2 where m is the
quadratic form. but if m has null-vector directions, one needs to go beyond quadratic order
in small uctuations, specically up to the order where the degeneracy in these directions
is lifted. furthermore, if this degeneracy persists to all orders (for example, because of an
exact symmetry), the intelligent prescription is to leave these directions unintegrated; instead
one introduces exact collective coordinates or moduli for these directions, and restricts the
small-uctuations integration to directions orthogonal to these moduli.

now let us apply these general considerations to the particular space of saddle-point
solutions obtained in sec. v.2 above. at the k-instanton level, to leading order in n, this
solution space has the geometry of (ads5  s5)k. however, a small-uctuations analysis in
the background of a generic solution point conrms that most of this degeneracy is actually
lifted at the next-leading order in n, i.e., order n 0 in the exponent. (the language here
should not mislead; note that one needs to work to order n 0 in the exponent in order to
obtain the correct leading-order expressions for quantities such as correlators.) in fact we
shall nd that the exact, unlifted, bosonic moduli space consists of only one copy of ads5s5.
furthermore, we will see that the leading non-vanishing small-uctuations integration in the
background of this exact moduli space (a necessary part of the saddle-point answer) can be
elegantly reinterpreted as a partition function of a standard supersymmetric su(k) gauge
theory, and in this way, reduced to previously known results. we will see that this matches
precisely the description of d-instantons in string theory.

in order to verify these claims, let us rst perform a small-uctuations expansion in the
neighborhood of a generic solution point on (ads5  s5)k. by generic we mean that for

(5.14)

we will truncate the expansion at gaussian order, and restrict ourselves for now to the
ij , aij , anij },
bosonic degrees of freedom. let us introduce k  k uctuating elds { w 0
in the background of the solution (5.11a)-(5.11c), by dening:

w 0 = diag(cid:0)22

inserting these expressions into se, one nds that the gaussian integration is governed by
the eective quadratic action

s(2) = x1i,jk(cid:16)vij  vij(cid:12)(cid:12)ij  ij(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:12)vij  ij(cid:12)(cid:12)

by inspection, the quadratic form (5.16) is positive semi-denite. the null-vectors can

be classied as follows. for the diagonal elements, the variations

ii =(cid:0)2

i aii , anii , 2i i  ii(cid:1) ,

have zero eigenvalue. these correspond to motion along the 10k-dimensional solution mani-
fold (5.11a)-(5.11c) parametrized by {x i

null-vectors are the k(k  1) independent variations ij in the directions

diag on the solution. in summary, at a generic point (5.14), all the gaussian null-
vectors correspond to directions which are already explicitly taken into account by the moduli
for (ads5  s5)k  u(k)/u(1)k
diag. conversely, since there are no additional null-vectors, we
conclude that at a generic solution point this moduli space is complete (at least locally).

however the generic case (5.14) is not the full story. in particular, whenever a vector vij
associated to a pair of instantons is zero, additional at directions appear at quadratic order.
the condition vij = 0 requires that the two instantons live at the same point in ads5  s5,
i.e., x i
a. at this special point, all the variations ij which are
orthogonal to the vector uij are at to quadratic order. correspondingly, the determinantal
prefactor (detm)1/2 blows up. additional zeroes of this determinant appear whenever the
positions of additional instantons coalesce, leading to a greater divergence. in fact, if one
were to exponentiate this determinantal prefactor, one would naturally interpret it in the
following way: at order n 0 in the exponent (that is to say, one order in 1/n below se),
there exists an attractive singular contribution to the eective action which partially lifts
the degeneracy in the moduli space, and draws the k distinct instantons to a common center
in ads5  s5 ! loosely speaking, this attractive singular potential results in a k-instanton
bound state.

motivated by these admittedly qualitative arguments, we therefore begin the small-
uctuations analysis afreshthis time, in the background of the maximally degenerate saddle-
point solution

a = 1 a 1[k][k],

w 0 = 22 1[k][k],

an = xn 1[k][k] ,

(5.21)
which corresponds to k instantons living at a common point {xn, a, } in ads5 s5. (from
the adhm constraint (4.52) it follows that the remaining components of w vanish: w c = 0
for c = 1, 2, 3.) this degenerate solution, unlike eqs. (5.11a)-(5.11c), is invariant under the
residual u(k). with the instantons sitting on top of one another, it looks like the complete
opposite of the dilute instanton gas limit; however the instantons still live in k mutually
commuting su(2) subgroups of su(n) as per eq. (5.13), which is a dilute-gas-like feature.
notice that, just as in the one instanton sector, the radius of the s5 is xed to be 1 at the
saddle-point.

in order to expand about this special solution, one rst needs to factor out the exact
moduli corresponding to the common position of the k-instanton bound state on ads5s5.
this is done in the following way. for each k  k matrix, we introduce a basis of traceless
hermitian matrices t r, r = 1, . . . , k2  1, normalized by trk t r t s = rs. for each k  k
matrix v we separate out the scalar component v0 by taking

v = v01[k][k] + vr t r .

(5.22)

the change of variables from the t r basis used in (4.1) {1[k][k], t r} involves a jacobian

(5.23)
where 1 refers to bosons and fermions, respectively. for the moment we continue to focus
on the bosonic variables, which are decomposed as follows:

v = k1/2dv0 dk21v,

dk2

an = xn1[k][k] + an ,
a = 1 a1[k][k] + a .

63

(5.24a)

(5.24b)

by denition the traceless matrix variables an and a are the uctuating elds (there is no
need to write an or  a).

inserting eqs. (5.24a)-(5.24b) into eq. (5.8) and taylor expanding is a tedious though
straightforward exercise. it turns out that one needs to expand out to fourth order in the
uctuating elds in order to lift all of the directions apart from the ten exact ads5s5 moduli.
the expansion of the determinant terms in (5.8) is facilitated by rst writing log det as
tr log and then expanding the logarithm:

tr2k log w = 2k log 2 +

1
2 trk(w 0) 

1
44 trk(w 0)2 +

328 trk(w 0)4 +

293

3

tr4k(cid:0)  (cid:1)3  2104tr4k(cid:0)  (cid:1)4 +    .

(5.26)

in these expansions we have dropped fth- and higher-order terms in the uctuating elds;
these terms are not needed to regularize the small-uctuations integration, and consequently
are suppressed in large n. in eq. (5.25) we have used eq. (4.52), while in eq. (5.26) and
in subsequent equations we move back and forth as convenient between the 6-vector and the
antisymmetric tensor representations of  and  using eq. (4.10). in particular, the so(6)
orthonormality condition    = 1 becomes, in 4  4 matrix language,

  =  1

81[4][4] ,

or

1 = 8  ,

(5.27)

which has been implemented in eq. (5.26).

next we need a systematic method for re-expressing the traces over 4k  4k matrices in

eq. (5.26) as traces over k  k matrices. we will exploit the following moves:25

  =     1

tr4 ef = tr4 f e =  1

(5.28b)

(5.28c)

tr4 ef gh = 1

16(cid:0)eafagbhb  eafbgahb + eafbgbha(cid:1) .

on the left-hand sides of eq. (5.28b)-(5.28c), the 4k  4k matrices {e, f, g, h} are assumed
to be antisymmetric in su(4)r indices and subject to the usual conditions (4.9)-(4.10); the
identity (5.28a) follows from a double application of eq. (4.9). using eqs. (5.27)-(5.28c) in
25in the following, we should emphasize that  only acts on instanton indices, as per the reality condition

(4.9), and not on su (4) matrix indices.

as before, on the left-hand side of these formulae, 4k  4k matrix multiplication is implied,
whereas on the right-hand side, all so(6) indices are saturated in standard 6-vector inner
products, leaving the traces over k  k matrices.

from eqs. (5.8), (5.25), (5.26), and (5.29a)-(5.29c), one obtains for the bosonic eective

action:

sb = s(2) + s(3) + s(4)

notice that only k2 uctuations, denoted , are actually lifted at quadratic order. this, in
turn, implies that certain terms in s(3) and s(4) are subleading, and can be omitted. specif-
ically, the omitted terms in the nal rewrites in eqs. (5.31b)-(5.31c) contain, respectively,
two or more, and one or more, factors of the quadratically lifted  modes, and consequently
are suppressed in large n (as a simple rescaling argument conrms).

65

now let us perform the elementary gaussian integration over the s. changing integra-

tion variables in eq. (5.7) from dk2w 0 to dk2 using eq. (5.31a), one nds:

z dk2

w 0 en (s(2)+s(3)) = (cid:16) 44

n (cid:17)k2/2

en s(4)

where the new induced quartic coupling reads

(5.32)

(5.33)

(5.34)

s(4) = 4trk(cid:0)     + 4(   )2(cid:1)2 .

combining s(4) with the original quartic coupling (5.31c) gives for the eective bosonic
small-uctuations action:

sb = 

1
2

trk(cid:0)4[an, am]2 + 2[ a, an]2 + 4[ a, b]2(cid:1) .

remarkably, all dependence on the unit vector a has canceled out.

notice that apart from the absence of derivative terms, the expression (5.34) looks like a
yang-mills eld strength for the gauge group su(k)! we can make this explicit by introducing
a ten-dimensional vector eld a,

in terms of which

a = n 1/4(cid:0)1an,  a(cid:1) ,  = 0, . . . , 9 ,

nsb(a) = 

1
2

trk [a, a]2 .

(5.35)

(5.36)

we recognize this as precisely the action of ten-dimensional su (k) gauge theory, reduced to
0 + 0 dimensions, i.e., with all derivatives set to zero.

now let us turn to the fermions. since n = 4 supersymmetry in four dimensions descends
from n = 1 supersymmetry in ten dimensions, and since all our saddle-point manipulations
commute with supersymmetry, we expect to nd the n = 1 supersymmetric completion of
the ten-dimensional dimensionally-reduced action (5.36), namely

nsf(a, ) = trk  [a, ] ,

(5.37)

where  is a ten-dimensional majorana-weyl spinor, and  is an element of the ten-
dimensional cliord algebra. to see how this comes about, we rst separate out from the
fermionic collective coordinates the exact zero modes, in analogy to eqs. (5.24a)-(5.24b):

 = 4a

 a = 4 a1[k][k] +  a .

 1[k][k] + 4a   a + ma
 ,

(5.38a)

(5.38b)

here a
 and  a are the supersymmetric and superconformal fermion modes (2.53a)-(2.53b).
expanding the fermion coupling in the exponent of (5.7) around the special solution (5.21)

66

and using the relations (4.52) and (5.31a), we nd

nsf = i(cid:16) 82n

and the  matrices according to eq. (a.12) below, we do in fact recover the simple form
(5.37). in moving from eq. (5.39) to eq. (5.37) we have dropped the term depending on
; since  is a quadratically lifted bosonic mode its contribution is suppressed in large n
compared to the other couplings in eq. (5.39), as a simple rescaling argument conrms. note
that unlike the bosonic sector, the a dependence of the fermionic action does not actually
disappear; as discussed in the appendix, it is simply subsumed into the representation of the
ten-dimensional cliord algebra.

(5.42)

notice that the rest of the measure, up to numerical factors, is independent of the instanton
number k. when integrating expressions which are independent of the su(k) degrees-of-
freedom, zk is simply an overall constant factor. a calculation of ref. [53] revealed that zk
is proportional to pd|k d2, a sum over the positive integer divisors d of k. however, the
constant of proportionality was xed denitively in ref. [52] to give26

as expected from the ads/cft correspondence (albeit counter-intuitive from the point of
view of the eld theory), only one copy of the ads5  s5 moduli space appears at any k.

v.4 comments on the ten-dimensional su (k) partition function

it is worthwhile making some remarks about the su(k) partition function zk dened in
eq. (5.42). to begin with, it may surprise the reader that this integral even exists! the
following nave argument suggests that it diverges [52]: consider the basis where a1 (say)
is diagonal; then uctuations in the directions where the other a are also diagonal are un-
suppressed. however, this argument does not take into account that for suciently large k
and/or d (d being the dimension of space-time), these uctuations are of measure zero. the
question of convergence has only recently been denitively settled in refs. [52]. for the purely
bosonic version of the integral, it converges in the cases {d = 3, k  4}, {d = 4, k  3} and
{d  5, k  2}, and diverges otherwise. in the supersymmetric version the convergence is
even better; in fact no divergent cases are believed to exist.

second, we invite the reader to compare our gauge invariant measure (5.41) with the
measure for d-instanton in at space, the u(k) partition function (4.13). clearly the u(1)
part of this partition function, describing the center-of-mass coordinates of the d-instanton
conguration has been generalized to the (supersymmetrized) volume measure on ads5 s5,
as in (1.7); however, the su(k) part of the partition function is identical in both cases. hence,
we nd a very attractive matching of large-n yang-mills instantons with string theory d-
instantons.
in particular, on the d-instanton side, the intuition of [36], suggests that, as
far as the contribution to the correlation functions gn, the d-instantons contribution can be
thought of as being due to a charge k d-instanton bound state, is matched by our large-n
instanton analysis and our identication of the moduli space as one copy of ads5  s5.

third, it is interesting that the large-n description of k yang-mills instantons, in an
n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory, is described by a su(k) gauge theory. this
kind of duality between gauge group and adhm auxiliary group has been noted previously
in a string theory context [4648], as is apparent from our discussion in sec. iv.2. for the
other classical groups, it is a well-known feature of the adhm construction that the duality
exchanges groups, i.e. o(n)  sp(k) and sp(n)  o(k) [73], although it turns out that in
each of these cases large-n instantons are described by a unitary gauge theory.

68

finally, we should comment on the fact that zk is proportional to the non-integer expres-
sionpd|k d2, rather than an integer as would normally be expected from the gauss-bonnet-

chern (gbc) theorem. the normal expectation goes as follows. we start by recalling that
the coecient of the four-fermion term in the instanton action can be identied with the rie-
mann tensor of the instanton moduli space; this is familiar from supersymmetric quantum
mechanics [84] and the analysis of the three-dimensional theory with sixteen supercharges
given in [30]. to formally evaluate the k-instanton contribution to a correlator such as g16,
one must bring down powers of the quadrilinear term to saturate the extra grassmann in-
tegrations which are left over after the explicit fermion insertions are accounted for. the
resulting bosonic integrand involves a power of the riemann tensor with various indices con-
tracted and is just the gaussian curvature of the moduli space. the relevant moduli space
here is actually a relative moduli space where eight center-of-mass degrees of freedom, which
are the superpartners of the sixteen exact zero modes, have been modded out. this space,
which we will denote mk,n is obtained by taking a quotient of the full moduli space of k
adhm instantons for gauge group u(n), by translations, dilatations and global su(2) gauge
rotations.

if the instanton moduli space were both compact and smooth the integral of the gaussian
curvature would simply be equal to its euler character by the gbc theorem. in this well-
behaved case the euler character is also equal to the index of the laplacian, or in physical
terms, the witten index of supersymmetric quantum mechanics dened on the manifold in
question. in reality the adhm moduli space is non-compact and has singular points where
instantons coincide or shrink to zero size. the three-dimensional case considered in [30] was
somewhat better behaved as the moduli space of three-dimensional instantons (which are bps
monopoles), while still non-compact, is smooth. in these cases, one can still formally dene
a witten index which now counts the number of normalizable zero energy states (weighted
by fermion number). however, this index is in general no longer equal to the gbc integral
which arises in the instanton calculation. instead, the gbc integral is what is known as the
principal or bulk contribution to the index which diers from the index itself by a surface
term.

taking various normalizations into account, the result of sec. v.3 can be interpreted as
saying that the principal contribution to the generalized index of supersymmetric quantum

contribution to the corresponding index in m(atrix) quantum mechanics, which is actually
just the n = 0 case of the conguration considered in this section, is also known to be

mechanics on mk,n is equal to pd|k d2 in the large-n limit. interestingly, the principal
equal to pd|k d2 [53]. in both these cases the surface terms must certainly be non-zero as

the principal contribution is fractional. this is to be contrasted with the three-dimensional
example discussed in [30], where it was argued that the corresponding surface terms vanish
(this vanishing was demonstrated explicitly in the two-instanton case). finally, we note that
the occurrence of integrals which formally give the euler character of instanton moduli space

69

suggests an interesting connection with the partition function of the twisted n = 4 theory
evaluated in [32].

vi large-n instanton correlation functions

finally, we can use our gauge-invariant large-n measure to calculate correlation functions
ho1(x1)  on(xn)i of gauge-invariant composite operators. before we consider specic n-
point functions, let us make the following general comments. at leading order in n, we can
replace each operator insertion with its classical k-instanton saddle-point value. since the
saddle-point solution of sec. v.3 is relatively simple, this observation greatly streamlines the
form of the operator insertions. we will restrict our attention to operators o(x) consisting
of a single trace on the gauge group index of a product of adjoint scalars, fermions and eld
strengths. each of these three adjoint quantities is of the type u xu where x is some matrix
of adhm variables; consequently o has the generic form

o(x) = trn(cid:2) u x 1u u x 2u    u x pu(cid:3) = trn +2k(cid:2)px 1px 2p   px p(cid:3) ,

where p = u u is the projection operator (2.10). it is easily checked that at the saddle-point,
the bosonic adhm quantities f , an, l and p collapse to

(6.1)

f

where y = x  x as before. deviations from these saddle-point values are suppressed by
powers of n1/4 as follows from the rescaling (5.35).

the analogous replacement prescription for the fermionic adhm quantities is, in general,
somewhat trickier. while these, too, are amenable to a saddle-point analysis as described in
sec. vi.2 below, they are also subject to the stringent selection rules of grassmann integra-
tion. in sec. vi.1 we will focus on the relatively straightforward correlators g16, g8 and g4
for which a large-n evaluation of the fermionic quantities is actually moot; this is because
all the grassmann variables in the insertions must be replaced by the sixteen exact super-
symmetric and superconformal zero modes in order to obtain a nonzero result. in contrast,
in sec. vi.2 we will discuss a tower of higher partial-wave operators in which, in addition to
these sixteen exact modes, there are left-over grassmann collective coordinates which must
be carefully analyzed in large n.

vi.1 multi-instanton contributions to the correlators gn

as follows from eqs. (2.11) and (2.46). here, as always, the grassmann parameters a

and  a measure the strength of the sixteen exact supersymmetric and superconformal zero
modes; for a nonzero result, each of the sixteen a
 insertions must saturate a distinct such
mode. the omitted terms in eq. (6.5) stand for the remaining, lifted, fermion modes which
can therefore be dropped. putting eqs. (6.5), (6.4) and (6.2b) together, gives us the leading

where the other fermion modes are neglected. recalling the denition (1.8) of the supergrav-
ity propagator k, we see that this is precisely the one-instanton expression (1.23) apart
from the overall factor of k, which comes trivially from tracing over a k  k unit matrix:

thus the sixteen insertions account for a factor k16 relative to the one-instanton calculation
reviewed in sec. i.3.

(6.8)

to leading semi-classical order, this is in perfect agreement with the corresponding super-
gravity expression dened by eqs. (1.14)-(1.15). in particular, note that the factor of k16
from eq. (6.7), taken together with the factors of k in eq. (5.45), precisely reproduces the
leading semiclassical approximation (1.14) to the modular form f16(,  ). moreover, thanks
to the proportionality (6.7), we have nally answered the puzzle posed in sec. i.3; namely,
we have seen how the k-instanton eld strength can look like a supergravity propagator for
k > 1. for this to happen, the dominant k-instanton saddle-point conguration needed to
look like k instantons not only living in mutually commuting su(2)s, but also sharing a
common size and 4-position, precisely as we found in sec. v.3.

next we consider g8 and g4. in order to calculate the corresponding insertions e ab and
qab one needs to utilize the adhm expression for the scalar elds aab(x) as given in sec. ii.7.
for present purposes we need to saturate only the supersymmetric and the superconformal
fermion zero modes by the insertions. neglecting the other modes, one easily nds:

iaab 

2(cid:0)a  a

  
k

 (x  x)k(cid:1)mn 

 (cid:0)b

  

bl

   (x  x)l(cid:1) vmn ,

(6.9)

where vmn, in turn, is replaced by the saddle-point expression (6.4). the computation of g4
and g8 proceeds similarly to the computation of g16. note that only the ab term in e ab
is needed in the leading semiclassical evaluation of g8, as the aaabac term is suppressed by a
power of the coupling g (as a careful rescaling of the component elds conrms). in particular,
the k-instanton insertions are again trivially related to their one-instanton counterparts:

.

(6.10)

e(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k-inst

,

= k  e(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1-inst

q(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k-inst

= k  q(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1-inst

once again, thanks to these proportionality relations, the space-time dependence of the corre-
lators at the k-instanton level will be identical to the one-instanton dependence. furthermore,
the relations (6.10) account for a factor of k8 and k4 in g8 and g4, which conspires with the
expression (5.45) to produce the leading semiclassical approximation (1.14) to the expected
modular forms f8(,  ) and f4(,  ), respectively, as in eq. (1.18). it follows that, just as
with g16, the large-n yang-mills results for g8 and g4 are in perfect agreement with the
supergravity expectations [34], order by order in the instanton expansion. for g4, there is
an identical contribution from anti-instantons at the same order in g2, as noted previously.

72

vi.2 kaluza-klein modes on s5 and yang-mills correlators

next let us consider the general problem of n-point functions in which the insertions contain
more than sixteen grassmann modes. of course, sixteen of these must be used to saturate
the exact supersymmetric and superconformal modes, as in sec. vi.1. the question becomes
how, in large n, to select the remaining, lifted, fermion zero modes.

to answer this question, we need to analyze the eective n dependence of these modes.
in analogy with the bosonic quantities (6.2a)-(6.2b), it is useful to think of the unbroken a
and a modes themselves as arising from a saddle-point evaluation:

ma

  4a

 1[k][k] ,

 a  4 a1[k][k] .

(6.11)

indeed, the rescaling (5.40) implies that the remaining, uctuating, modes in ma and  a
(which were denoted ma and  a in sec. v.3) are subleading compared to a and a by a
factor of n1/8. there remain the modes a and a, which are distinct from the others in
that they carry an su(n) index u. from their coupling to the a eld in eq. (4.51), together
with the rescaling (5.4), one sees that each ab pair in an insertion, for a xed, unsummed
value of the index u, costs a factor of n 1/2; however, summing on u (as required by gauge
invariance) then turns this n 1/2 suppression into an n 1/2 enhancement.
in other words,
a and a factors in the insertions should each be thought of as being enhanced by n 1/4.
the large-n rule of thumb for choosing fermionic collective coordinates in gauge-invariant
correlators is now clear: as many of the modes as possible should be a and a modes, subject
to sixteen of the modes being a and a modes to saturate these grassmann integrations.

with this rule of thumb in hand, let us examine a specic set of correlators of special
interest to the ads/cft correspondence. in sec. vi.1, we were concerned with correlation
functions of operators which on the supergravity side involved no dependence on the position
on s5. in this subsection, we will show that the dependence of operators on the position on
s5 is encoded on the yang-mills side in the dependence of the operators on the variables a
and a. as just alluded to, our discussion will further elucidate the mysterious role played
by the auxiliary variables a. in general, operators depend upon the grassmann variables a
and a which (we have seen) dominate in large n; however, gauge invariant operators can
only depend on the gauge invariant k  k matrix combinations ab. we now prove that,
to leading order in n, such a combination, in the nal integral with respect to the measure
(5.45) is replaced by

2gn 1/2

i

ab 

abcd cd1[k][k] ,

(6.12)

where the n 1/2 dependence has already been noted. to this end, consider a general insertion
with a string of such combinations a1b1      apbp. we must insert this expression
into the measure before the  integrals have been performed, i.e. into (4.1). performing the 

73

integrals as in (4.51) in the presence of the insertion leads to a modied expression involving
factors of 1 which can be derived by considering


a1b1     
xt


xt
= n p (det4k)n2k (1)b1a1      (1)bpap +    ,

(det4kx)n2k(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

apbp

(6.13)

where t acts on instanton indices and the ellipsis represent terms of lower order in n.
this shows that, after performing the  integrals, a term of the form ab is replaced by
(gn/8i)(1)ba, to leading order. now we rescale  as in (5.4), and replace it with its
saddle-point value (5.21) to give (6.12). the replacement shows that dependence on the
position on s5 is associated on the yang-mills side as dependence on combination ab,
where we recall from sec. iv.3 that the {a, a} are superpartners of the iso-orientation of
the multi-instanton.

we now consider, a class of operators which depend on the a and b in an essential way.
on the supergravity side, for simplicity, we will restrict our attention to a single supergravity
eld, the dilaton, (x, , ). although the dilaton is a single massless scalar eld in ten
dimensions, it yields an innite tower of massive elds in ve dimensions via kaluza-klein
reduction on s5. this dimensional reduction amounts to expanding  in partial waves as,

(x, , ) =



xp=0

a1a2ap(x, )y (p)

a1a2ap( ) ,

(6.14)

where the scalar spherical harmonics for s5 are dened in terms of the unit vector a as,

a1a2...ap( ) = a1
y (p)

a2    ap  traces .

(6.15)

the eld (n)
symmetric traceless tensor representation of so(6).

a1a2...ap has ve dimensional mass m2 = p(p + 4)l2 and transforms in the pth

the ads/cft correspondence suggests that each of these kaluza-klein modes is associ-
ated with an operator o(p)
a1a2ap in n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory which transforms
in the same irreducible representation of so(6)r and has scaling dimension  = p + 4. the
required operators were identied in [3, 4] as,

a1a2ap(x) = trn(cid:2)(ra)a1(ra)a2    (ra)apv2
o(p)

mn(cid:3)  traces .

here, r is an so(6) rotation such that  = r1 (0) where (0) is a reference point (e.g. the
north pole). the explicit relation (1.5) between gauge theory and type iib supergravity
correlators suggests [34] that we should compare the yang-mills instanton contributions to the
gauge theory correlators, ho(p1)(x1)  o(pr)(xr)ofi with the d-instanton contributions to
the following boundary correlation functions on the supergravity side of the correspondence,

here, of represents an additional fermionic operator insertion which is present to saturate
the exact sixteen zero modes of the multi-instanton and f are the corresponding insertions in
the supergravity correlator. another requirement for these latter operator insertions is that
they do not contain a or a modes (otherwise the complicated issue of cross terms with the
other insertions arises). for instance, of could be a product of sixteen composite operators
a
 considered in sec. vi.1.28 the appropriate bulk-to-boundary propagator for a eld which
transforms in a non-trivial representation so(6), and has scaling dimension  = p + 4, is
that which we would expect for an so(6) singlet operator, as in (1.8), augmented by the
appropriate spherical harmonic for the representation in question. hence the external leg
corresponding to the eld insertion (p)
a1a2ap(x,  = 0, (p)) at the boundary, with the interior
point (x, , ), comes with the propagator

kp+4(x, ; x, 0)y (p)

a1a2ap(r(p) ) ,

(6.18)

where we have dened the so(6) rotation r(p) such that (p) = (r(p))1 (0). as before, we
can now identify the degrees-of-freedom of a multi-instanton at large n, with those describing
a d-instanton on ads5  s5. since, we have already demonstrated the equality between
the measures, it remains only to demonstrate that replacing the operators o(p) by their
classical values in the multi-instanton background at large n is equivalent to the d-instanton
feynman rule (6.18) for the dual operators (p).

taking into account that the supersymmetric and superconformal modes are saturated by
the unspecied insertion of , let us set these variables to zero in the scalar eld. consequently,
at leading order,

iaab = u

where we have made use of the large-n behavior of l in (6.2a). we can now nd the
appropriate form for the operator (6.16) by taking the trace of a string of scalar elds and
v2
mn. notice that in the replacement (6.12), the combination ab is o(n 1/2), hence the
leading order term in the operator comes from the product of p bottom-right-hand corners
of (6.19). note that the product of p top-left-hand corners of (6.19), which potentially gives
a contribution of the same order, is canceled against the 0 in the top-left-hand corner of the
adhm matrix in (6.4). so at leading order

thus, at leading order in n, we have reproduced the feynman rule (6.18) for the equivalent
operator insertion on the the supergravity side of the correspondence.

vii comments and conclusions

vii.1 living large in a large-n world

prior to the recent applications to supersymmetric theories, the multi-instanton program has
had a checkered history (see sec. i of ref. [73]). on the positive side, the most noteworthy
technical achievements include the adhm construction of the full space of k-instanton solu-
tions [9] as well as the fermion zero modes and propagators in the adhm background [42].
on the negative side, the adhm construction has the major drawback that the collective
coordinate matrix a is highly overcomplete, and must be accompanied by the nonlinear con-
straints (2.20a) which are only explicitly resolvable for k  3 [72, 89]. a closely related
problem was the lack of a collective coordinate measure beyond k = 2 [73]. largely as a con-
sequence of these diculties, the adhm construction languished for many years as a largely
mathematical achievement with virtually no practical application to quantum eld theory.
instead, much of the multi-instanton work in the physics community focused on the dilute
instanton gas regime where single-instanton methods suce and these obstructions do not
appear. unfortunatelyby any measuresuccessful phenomenological applications to qcd
require an instanton density much greater than this regime allows, as well as considerations
of congurations of instantons and anti-instantons [90].

the addition of supersymmetry improves this situation substantially. on the one hand,
as reviewed in sec. iv.1, the fact that the bosonic and fermionic small-uctuations determi-
nants cancel, together with the stringent requirement of supersymmetric invariance, means
that the collective coordinate integration measure can be xed uniquely [41, 45, 79]. on the
other hand, a host of new exact solutions to the low-energy dynamics of models with ex-
tended supersymmetry have been proposed [25, 27] which have the property that physical

76

measurables receive contributions from all orders in multi-instantons. these testable predic-
tions have provided fresh impetus for explicit adhm calculations [26,43,78] which in certain
cases have suggested emendations to the original solutions.

as the present paper demonstrates, the situation improves even more dramatically when
supersymmetric adhm calculus is accompanied by the large-n limit. common lore holds
that instanton physics is unimportant in this limit [91]; after all, a single instanton is weighted
by the factor exp(82/g2) = exp(82n/(g2n)), which vanishes rapidly as n   with
xed t hooft coupling g2n. in the present paper, we have been considering quantities which
get all their contributions from instantons, except for tree and one-loop eects. they are
indeed tiny contributions at large n, as the standard lore would have it, but nevertheless
non-zero and with a precise, calculable, form xed by the ads/cft correspondence.

as we have seen, with the additional ingredient of large n, the multi-instanton series can
be evaluated explicitly, for the rst time in a four-dimensional theory. we envision that the
simplications in multi-instanton calculus in this limit will have widespread applications, and
are therefore worth emphasizing. let us enumerate the various lessons we have learned at
large n:

(i) a signicant calculational advantage of the gauge-invariant measure introduced in
sec. iv.3 is that the adhm constraints (2.20a), which are quadratic constraints in terms of
the original collective coordinates w, become linear constraints (hence trivially resolvable) in
terms of the gauge-invariant variables w. however, the gauge-invariant form of the measure
is only available for k  n/2 (see eqs. (4.28) and (4.30)). the large-n limit (with k xed,
or at least k growing more slowly than n/2) is therefore the regime in which these nonlinear
constraintswhich, we reiterate, have been the main technical impediment to progress in
adhm calculusentirely disappear.

(ii) the detailed saddle-point analysis of secs. v.2-v.3 conrms ones initial intuition
regarding k-instanton congurations at large n, namely, that the dominant congurations
consist of k single instantons embedded in mutually commuting su(2) subgroups of su(n).
since this conclusion follows from statistics alone, we expect it to hold equally for other
gauge theories at large n. in this respect the large-n solutions are dilute-gas-like as, in the
absence of other component elds, instantons that live in mutually commuting su(2)s do
not interact.

(iii) more surprisingand perhaps special to the n = 4 theory at large nis that these
k instantons live on top of one another in space-time, and share a common scale size. in
this respect, and in sharp contrast to (iii), the large-n limit is the opposite of the dilute
instanton gas regime. from the seemingly schizophrenic features (iii) and (iv) there follows
a pleasing simplication unique to large n, discussed in sec. vi.1: classical insertions into
gauge-invariant correlators can simply be replaced by k times the corresponding one-instanton

77

insertion.

(iv) another remarkable feature of large n is that the auxiliary variables a, a = 1, . . . , 6,
introduced merely as a mathematical convenience in order to bilinearize the four-fermion
interaction (3.2), become conned to s5 in the limit n  . as such, they provide a
window from the yang-mills theory into the ten-dimensional geometry of the string theory.

(v) finally, the 1/n expansion justies the truncation at the quartic level of the small-
uctuations action about the ads5  s5 saddle-point. one of the principal results of this
paper is that this truncated action precisely describes n = 1 ten-dimensional yang-mills
theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions. since the latter theory is also the d-
instanton measure (4.13), this is yet another unexpected window from large-n yang-mills
theory into ten-dimensional string theory.

vii.2 comments on the nonrenormalization theorem, and on higher-

order corrections in 1/n and in g2

as discussed in sec. i.1, the comparison between the yang-mills and supergravity pictures
elucidated herein can be quantitative if and only if there exists a nonrenormalization theorem
that allows one to relate the small g2n to the large g2n behavior of chiral correlators such
as gn, as has been suggested in refs. [40].
in the absence of such a theorem the best
one can hope for is that qualitative features of the agreement persist beyond leading order
while the exact numerical factor in each instanton sector does not, in analogy with the
mismatch in the numerical prefactor between weak and strong coupling results for black-hole
entropy [3]. in our view, however, our present results provide strong evidence in favor of such
a nonrenormalization theorem for the correlators gn, for the following reason. consider the
planar diagram corrections to the leading semiclassical (i.e. g2n  0) result for, say, g16,
eq. (6.8). in principle, these would not only modify the above result by an innite series in
g2n, but also, at each order in this expansion, and independently for each value of k, they
would produce a dierent function of space-time. the fact that the leading semiclassical
form for g16 that we obtain is not only k-independent, but already reproduces the space-
time dependent of the d-instanton/supergravity prediction exactly, strongly suggests that
such diagrammatic corrections (planar and otherwise) must vanish. nevertheless there are
necessary subleading corrections, both in 1/n and in g2, to our leading semiclassical results,
as follows.

in the one-instanton sector, the complete series expansion in 1/n, at xed leading order in
g, is encapsulated in the exact expression (1.26). at the multi-instanton level, the analogous
1/n corrections are encoded instead in the exact formula for the measure in (4.55). it may be
that the variables w 0 can be integrated out (as at large n) to leave a dimensional reduction

78

of a ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with a generalized action that
is some non-trivial function of n. the action could then be expanded in 1/n with a leading
term that is the conventional su(k) yang-mills action of (5.42). it is conceivable that the
more general action is of the born-infeld type [92].

finally let us consider the source of g2 corrections. as is clear from eqs. (1.11)-(1.12),
these corrections are absolutely necessary if (as we fully expect) the yang-mills expression for
the correlator gn is to sum to the complete modular form fn(,  ), and not merely reproduce
the leading semiclassical approximation thereto. yet how can such corrections be compatible
with the nonrenormalization theorem postulated above? we believe that the g2 corrections
arise, not from conventional feynman diagrams in the multi-instanton background, but rather
from the fact that the instanton supermultiplet constructed herein is not an exact solution
to the coupled euler-lagrange equations. this important point, which we stressed at the
beginning of sec. ii, stems from the fact that we have included for convenience all the fermion
zero modes in the collective coordinate matrix ma, and not just the exact supersymmetric
and superconformal modes. as discussed in sec. ii, this approach has the calculational
advantage that the quadrilinear action (3.2) is automatically generated at leading order. but
it also implies that the coupled euler-lagrange equations must be solved iteratively, order by
order in g. in particular, at the next order, the antigauginos a turn on, as do the auxiliary
supereld components d and f ; these, in turn, back-react on the classical component elds
already constructed in sec. ii, resulting in corrections to the multi-instanton action. we
expect these corrections to sum to the appropriate modular forms, but such checks lie beyond
the scope of the present paper. however, it seems likely that these corrections will be much
simpler than ordinary perturbation theory in the instanton background.

(a.6)

from these representations in 4 and 6 dimensions, we wish to build representations of the
d = 10 cliord. we shall need two dierent representations for secs. 4.2 and 5.2. first of
all we must explain some of the subtleties of dening majorana-weyl fermions in d = 10.

29as such we shall not distinguish between upper and lower vector indices.

80

majorana fermions can only be properly dened in minkowski space in d = 10, so we start
with a hermitian representation ,  = 0, . . . , 9, of the d = 10 cliord algebra. the
coupling of a 32 components fermion to a vector is given by . the majorana condition
on fermions is  = c t , with  = 0, where c is the charge conjugation matrix dened
such that for the euclidean space gamma matrices (0  i0) we have  = c1c. at
this stage we can continue back to euclidean space and simply treat the euclidean majorana
fermion  as real (since we never have to make use of its complex conjugate). in euclidean
space the coupling of a majorana fermion to a vector is

t (c1)t .

(a.7)

this coupling is not actually real, and the resulting hamiltonian is not hermitian. however,
this is not inconsistent because the relevant requirement in euclidean quantum eld theory
is osterwalder-schrader reection positivity rather than hermiticity. from now on we work
in euclidean space.

the charge conjugation matrix in d = 10 is

c = c (6)  c (4) =(cid:18) 0 i

0 (cid:19) (cid:18)i2

i

0

0

i2(cid:19) ,

(a.8)

the representation of the d = 10 cliord algebra needed in sec. 4.2, is built as follows:

where n = 0, . . . , 3 and a = 1, . . . , 6. in this representation

n = 1[8][8]  n,

a+3 = a  5,

11 = 7  5 .

(a.9)

(a.10)

a majorana-weyl spinor of positive chirality in d = 10 satises 11 = . in this basis, 
can be decomposed as,

 =r

2 (cid:18)0

1(cid:19)  (cid:18)ma

0 (cid:19) + r 
2 (cid:18)1

0(cid:19)  (cid:18) 0

a(cid:19) ,

 



(a.11)

where m and  are weyl spinors both of so(4) and of so(6). m and  have positive and
negative chirality with respect to both groups, respectively.

the representation of the d = 10 cliord algebra that is needed in sec. 5.3 is somewhat
dierent. the fermion coupling (5.39) can be written precisely as in eq. (5.37) with a rotated
representation of the six-dimensional gamma matrices that depends on a. we dene an
so(6) rotation matrix r, rrt = 1, such that a = rab b lies entirely along, say, the rst
direction, i.e. a  a1. in the new basis, we have a representation of the d = 6 cliord
algebra a = rabb.

in the rotated basis, we can construct a representation of the d = 10 cliord algebra as

follows:

n = 1  n,

3+a = a (cid:0)a15 + (1  a1)1[4][4](cid:1) ,

81

(a.12)

where n = 0, . . . , 3 and a = 1, . . . , 6. the representation of the d = 10 cliord algebra that
appears in the text is then found by un-doing the rotation on the d = 6 subspace:

in this basis

3+a = (r1)ab3+b .

11 = 7  1[4][4],

(a.13)

(a.14)

and a positive chirality weyl fermion in d = 10 is decomposed as a positive chirality weyl
fermion in d = 6 which is a dirac fermion in d = 2. with the correct normalization to repro-
duce the fermion coupling in the text, the d = 10 majorana-weyl fermion  has components

 = n 1/8r 

2g(cid:18)0

1(cid:19)   1/2 ma
1/2  a ! .
