(2.2) theories contain bulk spacetime fermions, would come mixed (r,ns) sectors. inclusion ns-ns sector odd fermion numbers means closed string tachyon projected out. third dier- ence type ii theories r-r spectrum doubled. discussed introduction, spectrum type 0 theories contains two (p + 1)-form r-r potentials even (0a) odd (0b) p. denote 2 cp+1 c purposes, convenient combinations p+1, unprimed potentials ones present type ii. (cp+1) = 1 2 (cp+1 c p+1) . (2.3) p = 3 electric (+) magnetic () potentials {$9811035$}. adopt terminology also values p. four types elementary d-branes  p: electric magnetic one (i.e. charged (cp+1)), corresponding antibranes. ref. {$9811035$} interaction energy two identical parallel (p + 1)-branes derived computing relevant cylinder diagram open string channel, analogously polchinski computation {$9510017$} type ii. isolating, via modular transformation, contributions due exchange long-range elds closed string channel, found one hand tension branes factor 2 smaller type ii branes. hand, r-r repulsive force two like branes double strength graviton-dilaton attraction {$9811035$}; thus type 0 branes couple corresponding r-r potentials (cp+1) charge branes type ii couple potential cp+1. open strings stretching two like branes bosons, like bulk elds type 0. however, fermions appear strings electric magnetic brane . 3. ns vebrane spectra type ii string theories massless spectrum ns5-branes derived via analysis zero modes classical supergravity ns5-brane solutions . nd convenient analysis t-dual objects, since geometrical interpretation manifest. t-duality type iia/b ns5-branes mapped type iib/a kaluza- klein (kk) monopoles. kk monopole described supergravity solution six worldvolume directions euclidean taub-nut (etn) metric transverse space. massless elds kk monopole correspond zero modes bulk supergravity elds etn. normalizable harmonic forms etn consist one selfdual two-form. ns-ns sector three zero modes broken translation invariance one scalar ns two-form. four scalars correspond translation zero modes corresponding ns5-branes. r-r elds give additional bosonic zero modes: iib kk monopole r-r two-form gives rise scalar selfdual1 r-r four-form potential leads 1by abuse language term potential forms (anti-)selfdual, according (anti-)selfdual nature respective eld strengths. 3 selfdual two-form; iia kk monopole vector coming r-r three- form. addition fermionic zero modes broken supersymmetry: two fermions opposite chirality iia kk monopole chirality iib. all, leads n = (2, 0) tensor multiplet iia ns5 n = (1, 1) vector multiplet iib ns5. repeating analysis type 0 ns5-branes, clear fermionic zero modes disappear (there fermions bulk). nothing changes far ns-ns zero modes concerned, r-r elds nd extra zero modes doubled r-r spectrum bulk. 0b ns5 extra vector (compared iib ns5), whereas 0a ns5 gets extra scalar anti-selfdual tensor. particular spectrum non-chiral branes. 4. absence anomalies one string loop type iia tree level supergravity action supplemented wess-zumino type term r b x8(r) coupling ns-ns two-form b four gravitons. x8 quartic polynomial spacetime curvature. original derivation one-loop term {$9505053$} provided non-trivial consistency check six- dimensional heterotic-type ii duality. apart that, specic piece action also responsible gravitational anomaly cancellation iia ns vebranes {$9506126$}. let us rst highlight aspects direct calculation type ii, enable us draw conclusions analogous type 0 amplitude almost eortlessly. first, interaction contains ten-dimensional symbol, odd spin struc- tures torus contribute, i.e. either left-moving right-moving fermions both, odd spin structure. furthermore, even spin structures summed achieve modular invariance. dierent perspective may also seen performing gso projection closed string states loop {$9906055$}. hamiltonian framework torus vacuum diagram written trace closed string hilbert space, decomposes four dierent sectors eq. (2.1). chiral traces sectors expressed terms traces fermion sectors periodic (p) antiperiodic (a) boundary conditions (, ) worldsheet directions: tr(n s,) = tr(n s,+) = tr(r,) = tr(r,+) = 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ((a, a) (a, p )) ; ((a, a) + (a, p )) ; ((p, a) (p, p )) ; ((p, a) + (p, p )) . 4 notice odd (p, p ) spin structure occurs ramond sector. gso-projected spectrum eq. (2.1) (r,ns) (r,r) sectors contain (odd,even) pieces, yielding 1 4 ((p, p ), (a, a) + (a, p ) + (p, a)) . (4.1) right-moving combination modular invariant, fact vanishes con- sequence abstruse identity. one calculate amplitude one b-eld four gravitons, one would insert vertex operators appropriate pic- tures. still, right-moving even structures would summed eq. (4.1). contrast partition function however, case non-vanishing result would found contradict alternative calculation ref. {$9505053$}. also argued type iib (odd,even) (even,odd) contributions can- cel whereas add type iia. latter probed interaction present. dierence type iia iib could inferred respective ns vebrane worldvolume spectra, chiral one type iia non- chiral one type iib. chiral spectrum suers gravitational anomaly six dimensions, neatly cancelled standard anomaly inow  bulk derived coupling {$9506126$}. let us repeat argument one-loop correlator type 0 string theories. (r,r) sectors contribute (odd,even) piece one-loop partition function, yielding 1 4 ((p, p ) (p, p ), (p, a)) (4.2) 0a 0b. type ii one may wish insert vertex operators. however, obvious obligatory sum spin structures eq. (4.2) yields vanishing result (odd,even) part itself. analogously, (even,odd) part vanish itself. whence absence anomaly-cancelling term type 0a 0b. reversing anomaly inow argument type 0a selfdual two-form must supplemented anti-selfdual two-form, order give rise gravitational anomalies. nicely agrees derived unconstrained two-form ns vebrane. t-duality additional vector (compared iib ns5-brane) expected type 0b ns5-brane. 5. s-duality type iib string theory fundamental string mapped d-string strings s-duality. green-schwarz light-cone formulation fundamental type 5 iib string involves eight spacetime bosonic elds sixteen spacetime fermionic ones. fermions transform 8s representation transverse so(8) rota- tion group. upon quantization, zero modes generate 256-fold degenerate groundstate, transforming (8v + 8c) (8v + 8c) so(8). excitations d1-brane described string perturbation theory quantizing open strings beginning ending it. so, ns sector gives eight massless bosons r sector sixteen massless fermions. note massless excitations fundamental string d- string interpreted goldstone modes broken translation invariance broken supersymmetry. believed iib d-string strong (fundamental) string coupling object fundamental iib string weak coupling. evidence conjecture largely based supersymmetry. one thing, ground state d-string bps, safely followed strong coupling compared ground state weakly coupled fundamental string. type 0b string theory supersymmetric, complicates analysis strong coupling limit enormously. let us nevertheless try proceed. fundamental type 0b string obtained fundamental type iib string performing (1)fs orbifold, fs spacetime fermion number. untwisted sector orbifold massless states (8v 8v) + (8c 8c) survive. light modes twisted sector singlet tachyon extra massless r-r states 8s 8s. bergman gaberdiel conjectured {$9906055$} fundamental type 0b string s-dual bound state electric magnetic d1-brane. pro- posal immediately raises two questions. first, one quantizes open strings coincident electric-magnetic d-string pair, one nds twice many massless excitations fundamental string: sixteen bosons thirty-two fermions. would lead way many states d-string pair compared fundamental string. could extra degrees freedom disappear? second, assuming found way get rid superuous degrees freedom, (1)fs projection appear d-string pair? concerning rst question, let us note naive mismatch immediate contradiction: compare d-string pair weakly coupled funda- mental string, one take former strong (fundamental string) coupling. along way, excitation spectrum may well change. second question, (1)fs projection might related gauging 2 subgroup gauge symmetry d-string pair. however, looks hard make ideas precise. fivebranes type iib ns5-branes s-dual d5-branes. objects light excitations (the reduction n = 1, d=10, u(1) vector multi- 6 plet d=6). case iib strings, part spectrum protected supersymmetry. given story strings, looks reasonable propose type 0b ns5-brane s-dual electric-magnetic d5-brane pair. raises two puzzles. first, spectra match? doubled gauge spectrum type 0b ns5-branes weak coupling related two gauge elds d5-brane pair? clear, since compare two objects one take one strong coupling, unclear happens. one thing, doubling gauge eld type 0b ns5 (compared iib ns5) related doubled r-r spectrum bulk type 0a, shown section 3. latter doubling expected persist strong coupling {$9906055$}. fermionic zero modes ns5-branes? found zero mode analysis bulk gravity theory, exclude could appear non-perturbative way. would analogous (not completely understood) case fundamental type 0 string, looks impossible interpret fermion zero modes zero modes bulk elds. second, type 0b ns5-branes carry anomalous gravitational couplings, known carried type 0b d-branes {$9809057$}? since couplings related anomalies thus topology, hope presence absence could invariant continuously changing coupling zero innity. case, answering question could provide test type 0b s-duality. rest section devoted analysing question. rst remind reader familiar story type iib. consider, instance, intersection two d5-branes string. open strings one brane give rise chiral fermions living intersection. chiral fermions lead gauge gravitational anomalies, cancelled anomaly inow branes intersection {$9906090$}. happen, d5-branes need, amongst others, c2 p1 (5.1) term wess-zumino action, c2 r-r two-form potential p1 rst pontrjagin class tangent bundle d5-brane worldvolume. presence term checked explicit string computation {$9808074$}. now, type iib s-duality implies presence chiral fermions intersection two ns5-branes string, thus b p1 (5.2) term worldvolumes ns5-brane (b ns-ns two-form). indeed, following argument2 presence term given ref. {$9511222$}. un- der t-duality transverse direction ns5-brane mapped kaluza-klein 2in fact, c2 p1 coupling d5-branes rst discovered. 7 monopole type iia. object described euclidean taub-nut metric transverse space. since p1(etn) 6= 0 b x8 term discussed previous section contains piece proportional b (p1)2, reducing term gives rise required b p1 term iia kaluza-klein monopole thus iib ns5-brane. type 0b? argued {$9809057$} chiral fermions thus anomalies present intersection electric magnetic d5-branes. hence, type 0 d5-branes p1 couplings wess-zumino actions (this also checked via string computation {$9809057$}). expect number chiral fermion zero modes intersections cannot change continuous increase string coupling. hand, paper argued b x8 term type 0a, expect b p1 coupling type 0b ns5- branes, thus chiral fermions intersections ns5-branes. argument correct, could problem type 0b s-duality. 6. little string interpretation type ii string theories vebrane worldvolume theories conjectured properly described little strings{$9506126$}. non-critical closed string the- ories hitherto remained mysterious, although qualitative features may understood. briey recall these, focusing type iib case. however, prefer rst treat familiar example fundamental string, providing guiding reference dealing little strings. fundamental string solution supergravity breaks half 32 bulk super- symmetries. broken symmetries give rise fermion zero modes string, 8 left-moving 8 right-moving. identied green- schwarz space-time fermion elds worldvolume. upon quantization fermions 128 bosons 128 fermions found, together building on-shell n = 2 supergravity multiplet. multiplet also found rns superstring, picture consistent. latter formulation hard see ns-ns sector elds together with, say, r-ns sector build n = 1 supergravity multiplet. likewise, ns-r r-r sector combined one multiplet n = 1. let us move little strings. one way derive properties little strings type iib consider gauge instanton d5 brane. half bulk supersymmetries unbroken d5-brane. sixteen real supercharges thus found, obeying n =(1,1) superalgebra. these, half broken instanton. macroscopic string thus eight fermionic modes, four left-moving four right-moving ones. upon quantization zero modes one nds 8 bosonic 8 fermionic states. correspond on-shell degrees freedom 8 one n =(1,1) vectormultiplet.3 upon decomposition respect n = 1 six- dimensional supersymmetry one hypermultiplet one vectormultiplet result. conceivable similar analysis type iia, possible all, would give n =(2,0) tensormultiplet, decomposing one hypermultiplet one tensormultiplet n =1 supersymmetry. remark tensormultiplet bosonic content consists one scalar one two-form potential self-dual eld strength. all, one may wish draw following analogies little strings type ii strings. cases one universal sector, hypermultiplet resp.
