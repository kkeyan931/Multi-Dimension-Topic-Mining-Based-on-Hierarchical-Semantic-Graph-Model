abstract

we present evidence that there is a 4d model that satises the con-
ditions of renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance simultaneously
at the 2-loop level. the traceless mode is treated perturbatively, while the
conformal mode can be managed exactly. the two conditions constrain
the theory strongly and determine the measure of the gravitational eld
uniquely. quantum corrections of the cosmological constant are computed
in part to 3-loop diagrams. the method to remove the negative-metric
states is also discussed from the viewpoint of dieomorphism invariance in
analogy to the r gauge in spontaneously broken gauge theory. the model
may be a candidate for a continuum version of 4d simplicial quantum ge-
ometry realized in recent numerical simulations.

1 introduction

for a long time, many authors have been longing to construct a well-dened
4d quantum theory of gravity [1][16]. renormalizability is a big problem that we
must overcome in such a construction. for this reason, we must make a theory
of this kind to be dieomorphism invariant. furthermore, there are physical
problems, such as unitarity, and the correct manner to dene the s-matrix in a
fully uctuating geometry. as a rst step, it should be claried whether there
is a model that satises the two fundamental conditions of renormalizability and
dieomorphism invariance simultaneously. in this paper we give evidence that
the model proposed in a previous paper [16] satises these two conditions. the
problem of the s-matrix and unitarity in our model is also discussed from the
viewpoint of dieomorphism invariance at the end of the paper.

along another line, there have been developments in the dynamical triangula-
tion approach [17, 18, 19] to a 4-dimensional manifold [20, 21]. recent numerical
simulations suggest that 4d simplicial quantum geometry with u(1) gauge elds
is likely to have a phase transition that is of higher order than rst [21]. naively,
if there is a continuum limit of 4d simplicial quantum geometry, it should satisfy
the conditions of renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance.

dieomorphism invariant quantum theory is formally dened by the func-

tional integration over the metric

z = z [g1dg]g[df ]g

vol(di.)

exp[i(f, g)] ,

(1.1)

where f is a matter eld 2 and i is an invariant action. the measure of the metric
is dened by the norm,

< dg, dg >g= z ddxggg(dgdg + udgdg) ,

(1.2)

where u > 1/d by the positive deniteness of the norm.
before the middle 1980s, pertubation theory had been naively dened by re-
placing the covariant measure with the measure dened on the background met-
ric, g, as [g1dg]g[df ]g. this replacement, however, breaks the background-metric
independence, or, a innitesimal version of it, dieomorphism invariance. renor-
malizability is also related to the problem of the measure. this problem could
not be overcome even by going to supergravity. it has thus been believed that su-
perstring theory [22] is a unique candidate for a background-metric independent
quantum theory of gravity [23].

at the end of the 1980s, a new approach emerged. this theory was formulated
in such a way as to preserve the background-metric independence, even after the

2in this paper all second order elds, except the gravitational eld, are referred to as matter

elds.

measure is re-expressed in terms of one dened based on the background metric.
two-dimensional quantum gravity was described exactly by knizhnik, polyakov
and zamolodchikov (kpz) [24] and david, distler and kawai (ddk) [25] in this
way. subsequently, several 2d models, such as dilaton gravity [26, 27, 28] and
r2-gravity [29], were studied. the idea can apply to even-dimensional quantum
gravity, which makes the theory background-metric independent. to do this, we
must add an action, s, as in refs.[16, 26]

z = z [d]g[ehdeh]g[df ]g

vol(di.)

exp[s(, g)  i(f, g)] .

(1.3)

the metric is now decomposed as g = e2g and g = (geh), where tr(h) =
0, adopted by kawai, kitazawa and ninomiya [30] as well as by the present
author [16]. the measures of the metric elds are dened on the background
metric by the following norms:

< d, d >g= z ddxqg(d)2 ,
< dh, dh >g= z ddxqg tr(ehdeh)2 .

(1.4)

(1.5)

the action, s, is the contribution induced from the measures, and it is related to
the conformal anomaly. note that the existence of an anomaly usually means that
a classical symmetry breaks down at the quantum level, but now the anomalous
contribution, s, is needed to ensure dieomorphism invariance at the quantum
level.

the action s must satisfy the wess-zumino condition [31] to realize background-

metric independence, the condition z(e2 geb) = z(g), referred to as the bmi
condition in the following, where  and b
 [with tr(b) = 0] are local functions.
since the measure [ehdeh]g, itself, is invariant under the change eh  ebeh,
the bmi condition for the traceless mode represents the condition that g and h
always appear in the combination g = geh in the theory [16]. although this is a
rather trivial condition, it implies that when we calculate s, we can guess the h
dependence if the g dependence of s can be formed.

in addition to being background-metric independent, namely, invariant under

general coordinate transformations,

 =

1
d

 +  ,

g = g  + g  

2
d

g  ,

(1.6)

the theory (1.3) should also be renormalizable. in 4 dimensions, s is a fourth
order function. in this paper we assert that the measure of a 4d gravitational
eld, including s and the fourth order invariant action [5][12], are uniquely

2

determined by the two conditions. thus the integrability condition discussed by
riegert, fradkin and tseytlin [32], which is generalized to the form that can be
applied to higher loops, should be satised. here, we emphasize that the fourth
order terms are required for dieomorphism invariance, and they are by no means
introduced by hand only for renormalizability, as in previous studies [6][12].

this paper is organized as follows. in the next section, as an exercise before
going to 4d models, we briey review 2d quantum gravity from the viewpoint
of dieomorphism invariance. the kpz/ddk formula [24, 25] on a spherical
topology is computed using dimensional regularization. in this model, many fun-
damental items are included. in section 3 we consider the 4d model proposed
in a previous paper [16], which is slightly modied here.
in 4 dimensions the
traceless mode as well as the conformal mode become dynamical. perturbation
theory is applied to the traceless mode, where a dimensionless coupling constant,
t, is introduced, while the conformal mode can be managed exactly [30, 16]. the
model studied by antoniadis, mazur and mottola [13, 14, 15] as an eective the-
ory of quantum gravity essentially corresponds to our model in the limit t  0.
in this section we present evidence that our model is renormalizable and dieo-
morphism invariant, in particular satisfying the integrability conditions discussed
in [32] up to order t2, or the two-loop order for the vacuum polarization of the
traceless mode. higher order renormalizability is also discussed from the view-
point of dieomorphism invariance. at the end of this section we discuss our
computations of quantum corrections of the cosmological constant up to order
t2, to which diagrams up to 3-loops contribute. the computation is analogous
to that for 2d quantum gravity, though the equation used to determine the con-
formal charge of the cosmological constant becomes biquadratic at this order. it
can be solved perturbatively. we nally estimate the strength of the coupling
t using the results of recent numerical simulations [21]. section 4 is devoted to
conclusions and discussion. at the end of that section, we discuss proper manner
to dene the s-matrix and the method to remove the negative-metric states in
the fourth order theory required by dieomorphism invariance. then, the role
of the  f term in the wess-zumino action is emphasized in analogy to the r
gauge in spontaneously broken gauge theory.
our curvature conventions are r = r

 and r

 = 

    .

2 review of a two-dimensional model

in this section we re-investigate 2d quantum gravity with n massless scalar
elds, x [24, 25]. since we wish to extend these arguments to 4 dimensions,
we do not use conformal eld theories here. the wess-zumino action s in 2
dimensions, referred to as the liouville action, is given by integrating the 2d

3

conformal anomaly as [34]

s(, g) =

=

a

a

4 z d2xz 
4 z d2xqg(g + r) .

0

here, the wess-zumino condition is dened by

s(, g) = s(, g) + s(  , e2 g) .

(2.1)

(2.2)

one can easily prove that s satises the above equation by dividing the region
of integration [0, ] into [0, ] and [, ].

the coecient a is determined by requiring dieomorphism invariance. let us
apply the general coordinate transformation (1.6) and x = x to expression
(1.3). the action i is invariant, so that i(x, g) = 0, but s is not. we obtain
the following expression:

s(, g) =

a

8 z d2xqg  r .

(2.3)

this is easily proved by decomposing the general coordinate transformation into
two parts,  = c + , and noting that s is invariant under c, which is a
transformation law in which  transforms as if it were a scalar eld on the metric
g such that cg = g  + g  and c = , while  is the
conformal change of the metric g and the local shift of  dened by  g =
2g and  = , with

(2.4)

 = 

1
2

 .

since  is innitesimal, the r.h.s. of (2.3) can be expressed as s(, g) using (2.4).
thus, (2.3) is identically the wess-zumino condition (2.2) with an innitesimal
value (2.4).

on the other hand, the measure itself is not invariant, due to the fact that

there is no e2 factor in the norm, which conformally changes in the form
[d](1+2)g[ehdeh](1+2)g[dx](1+2)g, where  is given by (2.4). this is easily seen
by applying the general coordinate transformation (1.6) to the norms dened on
the background metric as, for instance,

< d, d >g= z d2xqg(d)2
= z d2xqg(1  )(d)2 =< d, d >(1+2)g

,

(2.5)

where  =  + , so that d = d + d. in the second equality of (2.5),
the o(2) term has been omitted.

4

we rst evaluate the measure of the traceless mode. let us take the gauge-
1 g) = g = 0 to be as usual, where p1 is the projection

xing condition ( p 
operator to the traceless part such that g = ( p1). we then obtain

[ehdeh]g
vol(di.)

= [ehdeh]g det p 
1

p1( p 

1 g) .

(2.6)

as is wellknown, in two dimensions, the r.h.s. can be further written in the
form [34]

[d ](det p 
1

p1)

1

2 ,

(2.7)

1 ( p 

where [d ] = [ehdeh]g det p 
1 g) represents integration over the teichmuller
parameter. note that this rewriting is equivalent to taking the gauge condition
as h
 = 0 3 up to the zero mode, and hence obtain a gauge-xing term ibh,
where b is a symmetric traceless eld. the ghost action is then given by
bh|=c, which is the well-known bc-ghost system, where b is the anti-
ghost related to b and c is the reparametrization ghost. using the well-known
conformal property of the p1 operator [34], we obtain

[ehdeh](1+2)g = [ehdeh]g(cid:18)1 +

26

48 z d2xqg  r(cid:19) .

(2.8)

the measure of  is easily evaluated by using the bilinear term of the action,
i = s + i, as a regulator, which is that of a scalar eld. combined with the
results for the traceless mode (2.8) and n + 1 scalar elds, we obtain

[dx](1+2)g[d](1+2)g[ehdeh](1+2)g exp(i)
= (1  u())[dx]g[d]g[ehdeh]g exp(i) ,

where

u() = 

25  n
48 z d2xqg  r .

(2.9)

(2.10)

thus, the variation of the partition function (1.3) w.r.t. the general coordinate
transformation becomes

z = 6a + 25  n

48

(cid:28)z d2xqg  r(cid:29) .

therefore, the dieomorphism invariance requires [25]

a =

1
6

(25  n) .

(2.11)

(2.12)

this is equivalent to the condition that the algebra of the energy-momentum ten-
sor, namely, the virasoro algebra is closed without central charge at the quantum
level.

3if instead one chooses the ghost determinant as det p 
1

p1, one must treat the traceless mode

as a quantum eld [4, 30].

the lower-dimensional operator generally receives a non-trivial quantum cor-

rection. the cosmological constant operator, r e, for instance, where classi-

cally  = dim[] = 2, recieves the quantum correction

 = dim[] = 2 +  ,

(2.13)

where  is the anomalous dimension. in the following we consider the pertur-
n! n, and we calculate 

using dimensional regularization [13, 15].

bation theory on  in a at background as e = p n
the combined action in d = 2  2 dimensions is

where the bc-ghost is omitted. the conformal mode  and the constant  are now
dimensionless, while the eld x is of dimension , where  is an arbitrary mass
scale. the strategy to compute the anomalous dimension using dimensional reg-
ularization is as follows. consider the coecient a in front of the wess-zumino
action to be a bare coupling of dimension 2. we carry out a renormaliza-
tion procedure with a being unknown, and compute the anomalous dimension.
after regularization we take   0 and substitute the value of a required by
dieomorphism invariance into regularized quantities.
let us evaluate loop diagrams in the at background. we can easily see
that simple poles come only from the one-loop diagram in fig. 1. the sum
of the two-loop diagram (a) and the associated diagram (b), with the one-loop
counterterm insertion shown in fig. 2, yields only double poles proportional to
4. the higher-loop diagrams also do not yield simple poles.

where a is the dimensionless bare coupling dened by a = a2. since the bare

(2.16)

this value is exact to all orders of the perturbation. we thus obtain the quadratic

where we choose a solution such that   2 in the classical limit a  .
we now re-explain dieomorphism invariance in the context of dimensional

from dus argument [33], the variation of this counterterm w.r.t. the general
coordinate transformation, which is now converted into the conformal change of
the background metric,  g = 2g, gives the conformal anomaly u() (2.10),
because the conformal change in the scalar curvature in d = 2  2 dimensions
is given by the identity

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

qg r = 2qg r =  qg r .

we thus obtain the value (2.12), as explained above. substituting this value into
expression (2.17), we obtain the well-known kpz/ddk formula [24, 25] for a
spherical topology.

3 four dimensional model

in this section we consider a slightly modied version of a model proposed
in 4 dimensions the wess-zumino action becomes fourth order,

in ref. [16].

g is the euler density. they are dened by

g = rr  4rr + r2 .

(r)

(3.4)

and satisfying 4 = e4 4. thus, in order to ensure dieomorphism invariance
in 4 dimensions, the theory must be fourth order in the gravity sector. only in
that case is the theory renormalizable also.

here, note that r2 is not integrable w.r.t. the conformal mode, which is the
reason that the number of the independent parameters is three. this fact is
related to the integrability condition [32] discussed below.

let us apply the general coordinate transformation (1.6) to the theory (1.3)

in 4 dimensions. the wess-zumino action then changes by

s(, g) =

1

4(4)2 z d4xqg (cid:20)a(cid:18) f +

2
3



 r(cid:19) + b g + c



 r(cid:21) .

(3.5)

as in two dimensions, this is simply the wess-zumino condition (2.2) for the
innitesimal value

 = 

 .

(3.6)

4

the measure is also not invariant under the transformation (1.6), which confor-
mally changes in the form [d](1+2)g[ehdeh](1+2)g[df ](1+2)g with (3.6). the
coecients a, b and c are determined by imposing the condition of dieomor-
phism invariance, so that the  dependences from the action and the measures
cancel out.

the equations to determine the coecients a, b and c are now not so simple.
consider the case that the  dependence of the deformed measure can be re-
expressed in the form (1  u())[d]g[ehdeh]g[df ]g using the expression of the
conformal anomaly

u() =

1

(4)2 z d4xqg (cid:20)a(cid:18) f +

3



 r(cid:19) + b g + c 

 r(cid:21) .

(3.7)

the regulator used to evaluate the measures is now the combined action i = s+i,
which includes the unknown constants a, b and c, so that the coecients a, b and
c become in general functions of a, b and c. thus, the bmi condition, u +s = 0,
is now expressed by the equations

a(a, b, c) = a ,

b(a, b, c) = b ,

c(a, b, c) = c .

(3.8)

8

to be able to impose this bmi condition it is necessary that the  dependence
of the measure can indeed be expressed in the above form. this forces the
matter elds to be coupled with gravity conformally. as for the gravity sector, we
must consider the fourth order invariant action, whose form is restricted by the
conditions of renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance discussed below.
we consider the following invariant action, including fourth order terms: 4

i(a, g) = i4th + ile ,

where

i4th =

ile =

1

t2 f + dr2(cid:19) ,

(4)2 z d4xg(cid:18) 1
(4)2 z d4xg(m2r + ) + ia(a, g) .

1

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

here, i4th is the fourth order part, which could be regarded as being a part of
the measure. ile is the usual second order action, which describes low-energy
physics. m2 is the inverse of the gravitational constant, and  is the cosmological
constant. in this section we consider u(1) gauge elds as an example. ia is the
action of the na gauge elds.

above, we introduced the dimensionless self-coupling constant t only for the

traceless mode in the form [30, 16]

g = (geth) = g(cid:18)

 + th

 +

t2
2

(h2)

 +   (cid:19) .

(3.12)

the general coordinate transformation for the traceless mode is then expressed
as

where  = g. the bmi condition (3.8) can then be solved using a pertur-
bation in t.

in the following we consider a model with [16]

d =

1
36

(2a + 2b + 3c) .

(3.14)

this condition implies that the self-interaction terms of the conformal mode,
namely r2 terms in the combined action, cancel out. this model is analogous to
the 2d quantum gravity discussed in section 2. in this paper we assert that only
in this case does the theory become renormalizable and dieomorphism invariant
simultaneously in the perturbation of the traceless mode, where the coecients a,
b and c are uniquely determined by the dieomorphism invariance.

4note that the coecient d corresponds to c in ref.[16].

9

3.1 renormalization

to conrm the above assertion, we investigate the renormalizability and dif-
feomorphism invariance of our model focusing on how crucial condition (3.14)
is. we use dimensional regularization to regularize our model as a theory on
the metric g. here, we assume the renormalizability of our model and derive
general formulae for renormalization and dieomorphism invariance. in the fol-
lowing subsections, we show that no inconsistency appears in our model, at least
up to order t2.

in this paper we consider the m2 = 0 case for simplicity. thus, the bare

combined action becomes

i =

where d = 4  2. the constants a, b and c are considered to be bare couplings
of dimension 2, and t is the bare coupling of dimension . for later use we
introduce the dimensionless bare quantities a, b, c and t, dened by the relations
a = a2, b = b2, c = c2 and t = t. here, we set the dimension of the
conformal mode to zero, while the traceless mode is of dimension .

the renormalizations of the quantum elds and couplings are dened by the

following relations:

and

 r ,

h

 = z 1/2

h h
r

(3.16)

a = zaar ,

b = zbbr ,

c = zccr ,

t = zttr .

(3.17)

since the quantum traceless mode must be gauge-xed to carry out calculations,
we introduce here a more well-behaved variable, the background eld [35] for the
traceless mode dened by

g = (eth) ,

(3.18)

where h
dened by the relation [35]

 = 0. the renormalization of the background traceless mode is also

h

 = z 1/2

h

h 
r  .

(3.19)

on the other hand, since the dynamics of gravitational elds are governed by
fourth order derivative theory, and matter elds are coupled to gravitational elds
conformally, the counterterms for the background eld become fourth order:

if = pf

ig = pg

ir2 = pr2

here fr, gr and r2

the square of the scalar curvature written in terms of renormalized quantities,
respectively. the pole terms, pf , pg and pr2, are expanded as

where tr is the dimensionless renormalized coupling. the coecients fn, gn, ln,
and so on, are generally functions of the dimensionless renormalized couplings,
ar, br and cr.

the counterterms, if and ig, are conformally invariant at d = 4. in
particular, ig becomes topological, which is just an analog of the counterterm
(2.18) in 2 dimensions. in d = 4  2 dimensions, the square of the weyl tensor
and the euler density satisfy the following identities [33]:

qgr fr = 2qgr(cid:18) fr +
qgr gr = 2qgr gr .

 rr(cid:19) ,

(3.26)

(3.27)

on the other hand, the counterterm ir2 is not conformally invariant at d = 4,
because r2 satises the identity

qgr r2 = 12qgr  r .

(3.28)

this counterterm is related to the renormalizations of the couplings a, b and c,
and also the integrability condition of the wess-zumino action discussed in [32],
which is discussed in detail in section 3.3.

the renormalization of the background traceless mode is now dened by the

relation

f =

therefore, the background metric is not renormalized, and hence gr = g.

3.2 some results on renormalization factors

we present here some results on the renormalization factors discussed in the
previous subsection. let us rst compute the coecients f0, g0 and l0 in the
counterterms. they have already been calculated in refs.[14, 16] by considering
the case t  0 in a curved background.5 the interaction terms among quantum
elds then vanish, and the kinetic terms reduce to conformal invariant ones due
to condition (3.14), so that

the coecients f0 and g0 are given by the values

l0 = 0 .

since f0 is negative, this model is asymptotically free [10, 9].

next, we see that the wess-zumino action is likely to be unrenormalized to
r. first, consider the self-energy diagrams of the conformal mode in a at

order t2
background. the combined action is expanded as

the traceless mode, which is described by the wavy line, becomes

the diagram in fig. 4, for example, does not contribute, because such a diagram
now becomes order t4

integrating over l in the brackets, we obtain the divergence in the form

   + log 4. here, we also compute nite terms for two-loop
computations given below. the non-local term, log k2/2, does not appear in the
nite term.

diagram (b) in fig. 3 is rather simple. the two terms in the vertex l(4)
int,
shown in (3.39), produce logarithmic divergences. the other terms, including
derivatives of h, give vanishing contributions. hence, we obtain the following
divergence:

2br

r(cid:18)1
(4)2 k4(cid:20)3t2
  log

12(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(3.47)

therefore, the uv divergences as well as the ir divergences cancel out in the
sum of (3.46) and (3.47), and we obtain

zbz = 1

(3.48)

at order t2
r.

this result is related to the counterterm, ir2. since g r2 produces the

kinetic term 2 when the background eld of the conformal mode g = e2
is considered, background-metric independence for the conformal mode implies
the relations zaz = zbz = zcz of the renormalization factors, where z is the
renormalization factor of the background conformal mode. since the background
metric is not renormalized such that z = 1, we obtain

z = 1 ,

za = zb = zc .

thus, result (3.48) leads to

za = zb = zc = 1

14

(3.49)

(3.50)

at order t2
result implies that the terms of order t2

r. since we do not introduce a coupling for the conformal mode, this

r in pr2, (3.25), vanish, so that

l1 = l

1 = 0 .

(3.51)

here, l1 = 0 is rather trivial, because only the one-loop diagrams contribute to
order t2
r, which is a consequence of the cubic and quartic self-interactions of 
being dropped, by condition (3.14). the result (3.51) is evidence that an action
s satisfying the integrability condition [32] exists at tr 6= 0. this is discussed in
further detail in the next subsection.
r implies that the sum of the vertex diagrams (a)
through (e), shown in fig. 5, makes a nite contribution. this is likely to be true,
as in the case of the self-energy diagrams. however, because direct calculations
would be quite tedious, we need software to take contractions of the tensor indices
into consideration.

quantum corrections proportional to 3 and 4, whose terms are absent in
the action i, arise at order t4
r. replacing the wavy external lines of diagrams (a)
and (b) in fig. 5 with lines, we obtain corrections to 3 of order t4
r. their sum is
also likely to be nite, as in the self-energy diagrams of . in the same way, the
divergences proportional to 4 may cancel out.

hence, we see that, from (3.31) and (3.48), the vertices in the wess-zumino
action are likely to be unrenormalized to order t2
r, which implies that non-local
terms related to such vertices do not appear, and thus the wess-zumino action
does not change form.

15

3.3 dieomorphism invariance at two-loop

in this subsection we discuss the condition of dieomorphism invariance at the
two-loop level. to clarify the origin of the interactions, we divide the combined
lagrangian into three parts, as follows:

f + la(a, g) ,

1
lc = 2b 4 +
t2
lcs = a f  + b g ,
 r +
ln c = 

2
3

b



1
36

(2a + 2b + 3c) r2 .

(3.52)

(3.53)

(3.54)

here, lc is conformally invariant. expanding lcs produces conformally invari-
ant vertices linear in . on the other hand, the last one, ln c, yields non-
conformally invariant vertices.

the regularized 1pi eective action is divided into three parts as

reg(r, gr) = ir(r, gr, ar) + vreg(r, gr) + wreg(gr, ar) .

(3.55)

here, nite corrections vreg and wreg come from loop diagrams. the former
represents corrections to the wess-zumino action, and the latter represents cor-
rections independent of , which are related to the counterterms for the traceless
mode, if, g, r2, and those for matter elds. from the sum of the results (3.46)
r2br 4 +   . as discussed in subsection 3.2,
and (3.47), we obtain vreg =  7
4t2
there is no non-local correction in this part.
dieomorphism invariance now implies that the 1pi regularized eective ac-

tion satises the equation reg = 0, or

wreg(gr, ar) =

1

(4)2 z d4xqgr(cid:20)ar(1 + va)(cid:18) fr +

2
3
+br(1 + vb) gr + cr



r rr(cid:19)
r rr(cid:21) , (3.56)



where  is an innitesimal value (3.6). the r.h.s. of (3.56) comes from the
variation of the actions ir and vreg, where va and vb denote contributions from
vreg. while vb has been computed to order t2

r, with

vb = 

7
4

t2
r ,

(3.57)

va has not. the l.h.s. of (3.56) corresponds to the anomalous contributions
from the measures u(). here, wreg = wreg, because wreg is not include the
conformal mode , so that decomposing g into cg = g  + g 
and  g = 2g, wreg is invariant under cg. as seen below, (3.56) uniquely
determines coecients ar, br and cr.

16

the background-metric independence of the traceless mode implies that g and
h always appear in the combination g = geh. therefore, it is enough to know the
g dependence of wreg to solve the condition of dieomorphism invariance.

in the following arguments we consider only the g dependence of wreg. we
here omit tensor indices for simplicity. the weyl tensor is then described as c
and c 2 = f , where the subscript r can be dropped, because gr = g. the euler
density is also written as g = b2.

let us consider the wreg part, which is related to three counterterms, if ,
ig and ir2. first, we discuss the one-loop case [33]. at this order, only the
conformally invariant lagrangian, lc, contributes to the eective action. from
a dimensional analysis, the one-loop eective action should have the form [36]

w (1) =

out. going to the second line, (k2) = 1   log k2 + 1
the coecients vf and vg have been computed as vf = f0 and vg = g0 in (3.33).
hence, the counterterm can be written as

f and v

w (1) = 

f0


f 

g0


g ,

(3.59)

and the regularized eective action is described as

w (1)

reg = w (1) + w (1)

= f0 c log( /2) c  g0 b log( /2) b + v

f

f + v
g

g . (3.60)

the anomalous contribution is given by the variation of regularized eective

action with respect to the conformal change as

w (1)

reg = a0a + b0a ,

(3.61)

with

(3.62)
where a = ( f + (2/3)  r) and a =  g. to derive this expression we use the
following variational formulae [33]:

a0 = 2f0 ,

b0 = 2g0 ,

 f = 2a ,
 g = 2a ,

( c log( ) c) = 2a + o() ,
( b log( ) b) = 2a + o() .

(3.63)
(3.64)

17

here, note that using the formulae, we obtain the equation w (1) = 0,7 so that
w (1)

reg = w (1), as used in section 2.
hence, substituting the value (3.61) into the l.h.s. of (3.56), we obtain the
values of ar and br at tr = 0 as a0 and b0. here, note that a0 is always negative
and b0 is positive, and their sum, d0 = 1

18(a0 + b0), is positive.

the terms related to the non-conformally invariant counterterm, ir2, in the
regularized eective action in general have the forms r log( /2) r and r2. the
term r log( /2) r breaks the condition of dieomorphism invariance, (3.56),
and therefore it must vanish. this condition is now equivalent to the vanishing
of l0, (3.32). this implies that in order for the theory to be dieomorphism
invariant, those parts of the action contributing to the one-loop eective action
w (1) should be conformally invariant. this is now ensured by condition (3.14)
for the gravitational elds. matter elds must be conformally coupled to gravity;
only in this case does the theory become dieomorphism invariant. since the
variation of the r2 term is proportional to  r (3.28), this term determines the
value of cr. in the one-loop case, however, the conformal invariance is exact, and
hence such a non-conformally invariant term vanishes. thus, the value of cr at
tr = 0 vanishes.

let us analyze the eective action of order t2

r for zh). at this
order, the non-conformally invariant terms in the action contribute to it. the
eective action of order t2

r is divided into three parts as

r (or order t4

w (2) = w (2loop) + w (counter) + w (1loop) ,

(3.65)

where w (2loop) represents contributions of two-loop diagrams, which are derived
from the conformally invariant lagrangian lc. the contribution from associ-
ated diagrams with a one-loop counterterm insertion is represented by w (counter).
furthermore, there are contributions of order t2
r, but they are one-loop diagrams
described by w (1loop), which include the vertices derived from lcs and ln c.
since two-loop diagrams have two internal-momentum integrals, from a simple
dimensional analysis, we nd that w (2loop) has the following form:

w (2loop) =

t4
r
2

hrk4(cid:20)(cid:18) k2

(3.66)

here, the dependences of the momentum and the ir cuto mass, (k2)2, (k22)
and (2)2, in each term are the features of two-loop diagrams. on the other

7precisely, we have w (1) = o(), which reects the fact that the conformal invariance of

lc is violated by o() in d dimensions.

18

hand, since the associated counterterm insertion diagrams are one-loop, w (counter)
should have the following form:

w (counter) =

t4

hr(cid:18)

f0

 (cid:19)k4(cid:20)(cid:18) k2

2(cid:19)(cid:18)d



+ d(cid:19) +(cid:18) 2

2(cid:19)(cid:18)e



+ e(cid:19)(cid:21)hr .

(3.67)

since the contributions of two-loop diagrams come from the conformally
invariant lagrangian lc, the related two-loop counterterms becomes confor-
mally invariant. the conditions of renormalizability and ir niteness give con-
straints on the coecients. from the condition that the non-local divergence,
 log k2
1
2 , cancels in the sum of w (2loop) and w (counter), we obtain the constraint
2x  y + f0d = 0. the cancellation of the ir divergences gives the constraints
y = z = e = 0 and y + 2z  f0e = 0. hence, we obtain the following expression:

w (2loop) + w (counter)

(3.68)

the dieomorphism invariance (3.56) requires w (2)

reg to be proportional to
the anomaly forms a and a. this implies that the nite term including the
square of the logarithm should vanish, so that

xf = xg = 0 ,

(3.69)

h

which is equivalent to the vanishing of the double pole in the two-loop coun-
terterm. thus, the renormalization factor of the background traceless mode, zh,
does not have double poles of order t4
r. on the other hand, using the relation
between the renormalization factors, ztz 1/2
= 1 in (3.31), and the niteness of
the -function, one can easily prove that zh does not have double poles of order
r.8 thus, the relation ztz 1/2
t4
= 1 guarantees that we can impose the condition
of dieomorphism invariance at the two-loop level.

furthermore, the relation zt = z 1/2

implies that the diagrams with coun-
terterm insertions at vertices and at propagators cancel each other, and hence
w (counter) vanishes.9 the constraint on the ir divergences now becomes y
f,g +
8there is an analogy in qed, where the renormalization factor, dened by e = zeer, satises
the relation zez 1/2

1pi vacuum polarization does not have logn(/2) with n  2. (see, for instance, section

next we consider the one-loop part of the eective action w (1loop). re-
call that it includes the interactions derived from the lagrangians lcs and

conformally invariant counterterm ir2 also. from a dimensional analysis, we
obtain the form

the requirement of dieomorphism invariance is now equivalent to the re-

been indirectly veried by computing the self-energy diagrams of the conformal
mode to order t2
r in subsection 3.2. from the viewpoint of the vacuum polariza-
tion of h, this implies that the divergences contributing to l
1 in the one-loop
diagrams, which include the vertices coming from the non-conformally invariant
lagrangian, ln c, cancel out. as discussed at the end of this subsection, this is
consistent with the result in ref.[16].
furthermore, the non-local term  2 log( /2), which changes the form
of the wess-zumino action, does not appear in the regularized eective action
at order t2
r. the background-metric independence of the conformal mode implies
that the vanishing of this term is equivalent to the vanishing of the non-local
term r log( /2) r.

the anomalous contribution at the two-loop level is now given by

w (2)

reg = t2

r(cid:16)a1a + b1a + c1  r(cid:17) ,

with

a1 = 2f 

1 ,

b1 = 2g

1 ,

c1 = 12ul .

combining the one-loop results, (3.56) is now solved as

ar(1 + va) = a0 + a1t2
br(1 + vb) = b0 + b1t2

r +    ,
r +    ,

cr = c1t2

r +    .

(3.76)

(3.77)

(3.78)

the coecients a1, b1 and c1 are generally functions of the couplings ar and br,
while a0 and b0 are given by the constants. hence, the bmi condition can be
solved perturbatively. substituting the value of vb from (3.57), we then obtain

br = b0 +(cid:18)b1 +

7
4

b0(cid:19)t2

r +    ,

(3.79)

where b1 is now a function of a0 and b0. this equation is used in subsection 3.4.
at higher order, the conditions of dieomorphism invariance are expressed as
the vanishing of the non-local terms: c logn( /2) c (n  2), b logn( /2) b
(n  2) and r logn( /2) r (n  1). each term with n  2 is likely to
vanish to all orders, as in gauge theories. this is ensured by relation (3.31). the
non-trivial condition is the vanishing of the term r log( /2) r, which is the
generalized form of the integrability condition discussed by riegert, fradkin and
tseytlin [32]. this condition does not imply that ir2 vanishes at higher order.
this condition may be realized when we substitute the values ar, br and cr from
(3.78) into the expression of the regularized eective action.

this seems to be a trick of dimensional regularization. if there is a regulariza-
tion dened exactly in 4 dimensions, like the pauli-villars method, one would be
able to compute the eective action substituting the values of the constants an, bn
and cn required order by order into the bare action at the begining. then, such a

21

trick will not be necessary, and we could expect that all divergences will be renor-
malized into the coupling t and matter elds and other dimensional constants,
and that the wess-zumino action would not change form.

the diculty to prove the renormalizability of our model originates from the
fact that to preserve dieomorphism invariance, the wess-zumino action should
not change form, while the symmetry to preserve the form of the wess-zumino
action would be nothing but dieomorphism invariance itself. what can be done
seems to be merely to check for any self-consistencies of the theory.
in this
paper we have shown that our model can preserve dieomorphism invariance self-
consistently up to order t2
r for zh). since an extension to higher order
would be unique due to the background-metric independence for the traceless
mode, it is expected that our model preserves dieomorphism invariance to all
orders.

r (or order t4

here we comment on studies by kawai, kitazawa and ninomiya [30]. while
we apply dimensional regularization to the theory i = s + i (1.3), dened on
the metric g, it seems that, as far as using dimensional regularization, one could
apply it to the theory (1.1), dened on the metric g, taking great care with the
conformal mode dependence, as discussed by them. in their method it is expected
that the coecients ar, br and cr are automatically determined, while our method
has the advantage that conformal mode dependence is manifest, and hence there
is an analogy to 2d quantum gravity. the relation between the two methods is
unclear at present. however, it seems that the two methods might be the same
in the limit   0, at least up to order t2
r, because at this order the divergences
of the self-energy diagrams of the conformal mode cancel out for arbitrary values
of ar, br and cr. detailed analyses of this matter seem to be important to prove
renormalizability to all orders.

to determine the values a1, b1 and c1, it seems that we must carry out full
two-loop calculations. on the other hand, there is a naive argument that the
regulator of the measure is given by the bilinear term of quantum elds in the
combined lagranigan, l = 1
, a). then,
using the special property of fourth order operators, we obtain an annomalous
contribution formally expressed in the form [16]

2tk + o(3), where t = (, h

 2t r(cid:16)ek(cid:17) ,

(3.80)

where  is a cut-o. this is essentially a one-loop contribution, and hence it
determines the values of wf and wg. the proof in ref.[16] of the wess-zumino
condition for fourth order operators now implies that wl (= l
1) = 0, which is
consistent with what we mentioned above. here, it is worth commenting on
our previous work. in the proof given in section 3 in ref.[16], it was assumed
that an action s satisfying the integrability condition [32] exists. therefore, the
proof implies that, if it does exist, the variation of the part of the wess-zumino
action s related to one-loop diagrams is given by (3.80). applying the proof

22

to our model, existence at t = 0 is guaranteed by condition (3.14), but not for
t 6= 0. however, since the g dependence of s is determined by the background-
metric independence of the conformal mode, the h dependence of s is uniquely
determined by the background-metric independence of the traceless mode, as
mentioned in the introduction. thus, the existence of s is guaranteed in our
model, so that wl = 0.

here we conjecture that only the one-loop diagrams contribute to wreg, and
thus a1 = 2wf and b1 = 2wg, because (3.80) is the most simple expression giving
the wess-zumino action at all orders. using the generalized schwinger-dewitt
technique [12], as in ref.[16], we obtain 11

let us compute the quantum corrections of the cosmological constant, e.

in 4 dimensions, the constant  should satisfy the equation [13]

 = dim[] = 4 +  ,

(3.83)

where  is the anomalous dimension. here, we calculate  up to order t2
r. the
contribution to zeroth order of tr is given by the one-loop diagram in fig. 1,
as in the two-dimensional model. the diagrams of order t2
r contributing to the
renormalization factor proportional to 2 are the two 2-loop diagrams, (a) and
(b), and the 1-loop diagram, (c), in fig. 6. unlike the two-dimensional model,
there are contributions proportional to 3 and 4. they are given by diagrams
(a) and (b) in fig. 7, respectively.

11in ref.[16] we used the gauge-xing condition that the conformal mode and the traceless
mode are mixed. however, this is incorrect, because we did not introduce the coupling t for the
conformal mode. to ensure gauge independence, we here use the feynman-type gauge  = 1
in (3.41), and the coecients a and b are re-calculated. now, the o-diagonal term in the
operator k becomes fourth order, but it can be managed in the perturbation by reducing the
expression of t r log k to the formula given in ref.[12] by using an identity like, for example
4 g r
 v =  v + 2 r
r v, repeatedly, where the constraints r = 1
and  r = 0 are imposed as in ref.[16], so that the coecient cr cannot be determined.

the rst term in the parentheses of the r.h.s. comes from the one-loop diagram

there is no counterterm insertion diagrams, because all subdiagrams (namely,
the sum of (a) and (b) in fig. 3, the sum of (a) and (b) in fig. 8, and (c) itself
in fig. 8) give nite contributions. furthermore, diagrams (a) and (b) in fig. 9
each gives a nite contribution. the niteness of the sum of diagrams (a) and
(b) in fig. 8 and of (c) in fig. 8 is also evidence of renormalizability.

if the gray part is a

let us compare our model with the dynamical triangulation approach to 4d
quantum gravity. in this approach there is no ambiguity choosing the measure,
unlike with regges calculus. furthermore, although this lattice model has pa-
rameters corresponding to the gravitational constant and the cosmological con-
stant, there is no dimensionless coupling tr, unlike in the usual lattice gauge
theories. this indicates that, in continuum theory, the measure of a gravita-
tional eld including fourth order parts may be uniquely determined. here, we
estimate the strength of the coupling constant tr realized in recent numerical
experiments [21], which suggest that  is imaginary for na = 0 but becomes
real for na  1.
recall that b0 is slightly greater than 4 for a small value of na. thus, 0 is
close to 8. therefore, the 3- and 4-terms and also the third term proportional
to 2 in the parentheses of (3.86) are estimated as having a value on the order
o(1) t2
r, while the second term in the parentheses, which comes from the sum of
the two-loop diagrams (a) and (b) in fig. 6, is more than 10-times greater than
them. therefore, we neglect the terms proportional to 3 and 4. then, the
equation reduces to a quadratic form, and we obtain the following discriminant:

j = b0 +(cid:18)b1

(3.88)

26

the results of the simulations [21] can now be described as j < 0 for na = 0, but
j > 4 for na  1. if b1 = 2wg is assumed,12 there is a solution of the inequality,
and we obtain the relation 0.025 < t2
r < 0.040 for the coupling constant. if b1 is
neglected, the central value shifts by about +0.01. expression (3.87) is valid in
this region.

4 conclusions and discussion

in this paper we considered the problems of renormalizability and dieomor-
phism invariance in a 4d quantum theory of gravity. we considered a pertur-
bation theory for the traceless mode, where the dimensionless coupling constant
t was introduced, while the conformal mode was managed exactly. we found
evidence that there is a model that satises the two conditions of renormalizabil-
ity and dieomorphism invariance simultaneously; it is uniquely determined to
be model (3.9) with (3.14) if we do not introduce fourth order elds, except for
metric elds. in particular, the vanishing of l1 and l
1 in (3.25), which is required
by the integrability condition discussed by riegert, fradkin and tseytlin [32],
gives a breakthrough to the two-loop renormalizability of 4d quantum gravity.

our conclusion seems to be plausible from the viewpoint of 4d simplicial quan-
tum geometry, because dynamical triangulation chooses a measure uniquely, and
therefore the measure of the corresponding continuum theory may be determined
uniquely. we expect that it may be given by the fourth order parts of our model.
the fourth order model in 4 dimensions is quite similar to the second order
model in two dimensions. we can rather easily compute the quantum corrections
of the cosmological constant up to order t2
r, as in the case of 2d quantum gravity,
and we obtain the biquadratic equation (3.83) with (3.86). quantum corrections
of the einstein-hilbert term are also quite important. determining these is a
future project.

in this paper we did not consider gauge interactions, such as qed and yang-
mills theories. if gauge couplings are introduced, one has to add a new coupling,
t r(ff ), to the action s. the coecient  then becomes a function of the
gauge coupling, determined from the non-local logarithmic terms of the regular-
ized vacuum polarizations of gauge elds.

to this point, we have focused only on the two fundamental conditions of
renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance. theories satisfying these two
conditions could be called quantum geometry rather than quantum gravity.
to discuss quantum gravity, which should describe our universe, we need to dene
the s-matrix.

12note that 2wg is negative and that |2wg| is less than b0 for small na.

fig. 12: image of the s-matrix of a re ball/black hole formation
and evaporation. the lines with arrows denote matter elds.

the wavy lines are gravitational elds in the low-energy
asymptotic region. in the re-ball region, the fourth order

terms are turned on.

recall, as computed in section 3.4, the cosmological constant receives non-
trivial quantum corrections, because the propagators of the gravitational modes
are proportional to 1/k4, and tadpole-type diagrams have logarithmic diver-
gences. this is one dierence between the fourth order theories and second order
theories merely with negative-metric states. one can dene dieomorphism-
invariant correlation functions in such a fully uctuating geometry. however,
when one attempts to dene the s-matrix, one encounters the problem of how
to dene the asymptotic states for the gravitational modes. since the states are
always dressed by the conformal mode when the fourth order kinetic term of the
conformal mode exists, it seems that one has to consider an unusual interaction
picture in which the fourth order parts are turned o in the asymptotic region, as
in a picture of a quantum black hole, where an asymptotically at region exists
(fig. 12) [38]. in this picture, negative-metric states in the fourth order terms
required by dieomorphism invariance do not appear in the low-energy asymp-
totic region, because there, gravity is ruled by the einstein-hilbert term. hence,
the negative-metric state is unstable and seems to be conned in the internal
high-energy region, where the fourth order terms are turned on [39, 9, 40].

more directly, as a consequence of the background-metric independence, or
dieomorphism invariance, the presence of the  f term in the action implies
that we can remove the weyl term, f , by shifting the conformal mode by a
constant. thus, although in this gauge the theory becomes unrenormalizable,
we can remove the negative-metric state for the traceless mode. this situation
is somewhat reminiscent the argument of the r gauge in spontaneously broken
gauge theory [41].

let us compute the degrees of freedom in this case. we must now treat the
r2 term and the einstein-hilbert term. then, the gauge-xing term  in
(3.41) is not necessary. hence, n is proportional to  + m2, where
m2 originates from the einstein-hilbert term, which is proportional to m2. the
ghost determinant is now given by det1/2( + m2) det m gh
 , where m gh


28

is the usual second order ghost operator of dieomorphism invariance dened
  = |h=0. note that det( + m2) = det( +
by the relation m gh
m2)|a scalar (see, for instance, ref.[12]), so that the number of ghost degrees of
freedom is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. hence, the total number of degrees of freedom becomes
21+99 = 2. thus, the negative-metric state related to the conformal mode is
also removed by ghosts. we expect that in the general case, the negative-metric
states for the traceless mode may be conned, due to dieomorphism invariance.
