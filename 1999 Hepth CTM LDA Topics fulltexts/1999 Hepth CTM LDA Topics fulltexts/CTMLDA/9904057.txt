(3.5) (3.6) (3.7) (3.8) (3.9) (3.10) evidently, (3.10) brs transform (3.9). since new operators encountered right-hand sides (3.5)-(3.10), easily calculate multiple (anti)commutators explicitly. construct truncated) wightman functions consistent multiple (anti)commutators energy positivity condition. 1-point functions are, principle, completely arbitrary. set equal zero deliberately violate (3.1), fp-ghost number conservation, brs invariance o(d) symmetry. ) truncation means drop contributions vacuum intermediate states. truncated wight- man function corresponds connected greens function. present model, distinction truncated nontruncated appears n 4. 7 nonvanishing truncated n-point wightman functions consist (n2) bs either c c two s. diagrammatically, represented tree diagrams. although explicitly constructed them, 6) quote 2-point 3-point ones only. nonvanishing 2-point wightman functions h (x1)n (x2) = h c(x1)c (x2) = h c (x1)c(x2) = 2id (+)(x1 x2), n (+)(x1 x2), where) nonvanishing 3-point ones (+)(x) 1 4 1 x i0 . h (x1)b(x2)n (x3) = 2m h c(x1)b(x2)c (x3) = 8id (+)(x1 x2) n (+)(x1 x2) (+)(x2 x3), 2d (+)(x2 x3) 2d (+)(x1 x2) (+)(x2 x3) 4i (3.11) (3.12) (3.13) (3.14) (3.15) permutated ones, whose expressions obtained changing (+)(x)s  become consistent energy-positivity condition (and changing overall sign order c c reversed). system wightman functions is, course, consistent eld algebra dened (3.5)-(3.10). also consistent brs invariance fp-ghost number conservation. noted need use generalized normal-product rule check brs invariance. system wightman functions also consistent linear eld equations (3.1), (3.3) (3.4), nonlinear eld equation (3.2). indeed, using generalized normal-product rule, show h b(x1)b(x2) = 0, h b(x1)et (x2) = h et (x1)et (x2) = 2(d 26)2 (3.16) (3.17) contradiction (3.2). thus eld equation (3.2), modulo (3.3) x = b, violated level representation terms state vectors. call matter eld-equation anomaly. phenomenon encountered also several two-dimensional quantum-gravity models. 4) - 7) ) (+)(x) infrared divergent therefore requires introduction infrared cuto. 12) 8 brs noether current (2.18) rewritten jb j b = j b + (b et )c, bc + ic cc.

(4.12) (4.13) two-point functions eective action obtained taking matrix inverse (4.10)-(4.13). accordingly, 2(x1 x2)b(x1)h(x2) (2) rh(x1)h(x2) + , (4.14) =z d2x1z d2x2 x= 26 1 2 + 2 subscript r indicates regularization. brs-violating term (4.14) converted conformal-anomaly term adding conformal degree freedom. work procedure detail aim so. important point violation brs invariance b-eld greens func- tions. de donder gauge case, brs violation arisen applying dimensional regularization internal lines external lines. 9), 14) present model, ex- ternal lines absent (4.2) local. instead, seen (4.9), perturbative approach makes use eld-equation anomaly without aware fact. 5. path-integral approach path integral directly gives us generating function greens functions, is, deals t-product quantities only. path integral z formally expressed z(j) =z (cid:16)yi di(cid:17) exp iz dnx(l +xi jii) (5.1) z(0) = 1, ji denotes source function corresponding eld i. possible derive path-integral formula  canonical operator formalism. 15) sense, path-integral formalism regarded one equivalent operator formalism. but, one note that, derivation, one must use eld equations representation level. fact implies path-integral formalism cannot take care existence eld-equation anomaly. 11 successful experience discussing anomaly problem gauge theories, customary believe anomaly always arises non-invariance path-integral measure symmetry leaves action invariant. point anomalies arise also eld-equation anomaly beyond scope path-integral formalism. let f () arbitrary function is. path-integral measure supposed invariant functional translation + i. hence, considering variation eld f (i1/j)z|j=0, obtain ih f () + h f () = 0. (5.2) equation corresponds eld equation s/i = 0 operator formalism. second term (5.2) eld-equation violating term due use t-product. one never confuse eld-equation anomaly. example, conformal- gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity, (4.14) reproduced (5.2) setting f = b = b. likewise, set f = b = h (5.2), obtain h b(b eet ) = 0, (5.3) is, encounter eld-equation anomaly. instead, shown per- turbative approach, (5.3) induces violation brs invariance path-integral approach. historically, anomaly problem conformal-gauge two-dimensional quantum grav- ity discussed rst fujikawa 16) path-integral formalism. formulation not, however, understandable framework stated 4. first, takes three degrees freedom g path-integration variables; never- theless, ghost elds two degrees freedom. extra one degree freedom conformal one, denoted , allowed ) integrated (until liouville action derived) spite fact independent path-integration variable. second, introducing tilde elds = nii, ni certain fractional number, claims path-integral measure becomes brs invariant expressed terms tilde elds. derives liouville action expressed terms alone calculating variation path-integral measure conformal transformation. is, according theory, conformal anomaly directly obtained without passing brs anomaly contradiction consideration presented 4. ) one carries integration introducing conformal ghosts, becomes impossible work analysis. 12 thus unable reproduce analysis terms explicit solution. 6. fp-ghost number current anomaly emphasized previously, 6) fp-ghost number anomaly conformal- gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity: exact solution completely consistent fp-ghost number conservation. conservation fp-ghost number current jc simple consequence fact c(x) c (x) independent x. property never violated representation level. nevertheless, many authors claimed fp-ghost number current anomaly. reasons occurrence belief correspondence riemann-roch theorem eld-equation-violating property t-product. fujikawa 16) rst claim existence fp-ghost number current anomaly. derived making fp-ghost number transformation) path-integral formalism described end 5. result written hh jc ii = 3 4hh 2 log ii, (6.1) denote path integration hh ii. degrees reparametrization freedom suppressed, one may write 2 log = gr (euclidean metric used). must note fujikawas theory formulated background metric path-integration variable. shortly later, friedan, martinec shenker, 17) formulated conformal eld theory, quoted (6.1) disguised form. consider completely curved background metric g. right-hand side equation const.g r, function g, noth- ing quantity required riemann-roch theorem prerequisite conformal covariance. may certainly analogous (6.1), cannot nd logical connection them.) perturbative approach, friedan-martinec-shenker version (6.1) inter- preted, consideration based eective action, matter 18), 19) j h jc g i|g = (6.2) ) must done original tilde-variable expression. anomaly derived naive calculation transformation made equivalent expression liouville action explicitly. ) according fujikawa (private communication), possible existence zero points take care eect topological numberr d2xg r. see idea formulated. 13 nonvanishing nonlocal term, g background metric introduced way gauge-xing plus fp-ghost lagrangian density becomes background covariant. note (6.2) background metric taken feynman-diagram calculation. conformal-gauge case, j essentially equal h jc (x1)et (x2) = 12d f(x1 x2) 2d f(x1 x2).
