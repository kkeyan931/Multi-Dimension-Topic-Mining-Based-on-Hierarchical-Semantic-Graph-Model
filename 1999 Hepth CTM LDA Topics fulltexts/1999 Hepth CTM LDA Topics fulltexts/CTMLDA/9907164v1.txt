abstract

f-theory on k3 admits non-bps states that are represented as string junctions extend-
ing between 7-branes. we classify the non-bps states which are guaranteed to be stable
on account of charge conservation and the existence of a region of moduli space where
the 7-branes supporting the junction can be isolated from the rest of the branes. we nd
three possibilities; the 7-brane congurations carrying: (i) the d1 algebra representing
a d7-brane near an orientifold o7-plane, whose stable non-bps state was identied be-
fore, (ii) the exotic ane e1 algebra, whose stable non-bps state seems to be genuinely
non-perturbative, and, (iii) the ane e2 algebra representing a d7-brane near a pair of
o7-planes. as a byproduct of our work we construct explicitly all 7-brane congurations
that can be isolated in a k3. these include non-collapsible congurations of ane type.

introduction and summary

many string theories contain in their spectrum states which are non-bps but are never-
theless stable due to the fact that they carry certain charge, and there are no other bps

or non-bps states of lower mass carrying the same charge into which they can decay. a
particular class of examples consist of a conguration where a single d-p-brane is brought

close to an orientifold p-plane (o-p-plane). in this case the fundamental string stretched
between the d-brane and its image represents a non-bps state. furthermore it carries
charge under a u(1) gauge eld living on the d-brane, and as long as there are no other

d-branes nearby, there is no bps state of lower mass carrying this u(1) charge into which
this non-bps state can decay. thus it will represent a stable non-bps state. such con-

gurations arise in certain regions of the moduli space of the toroidal compactication of
type i string theory.

the special case of the d7-brane  o7-plane system was discussed in [1]. when non-
perturbative eects are taken into account, the o7-plane splits into a pair of 7-branes [2].

we shall use the language of ref.[3, 4] to refer to the original d7-brane as an a-type brane

2

and to the other two 7-branes representing the o7-plane as b and c-type branes. in this
description the non-bps state can be represented as a string junction2 j with its prongs
ending on the three 7-branes[3, 4].3 in the limit when the separation between these three
7-branes is large compared to the string length scale ls, the mass of the state j can be
computed by adding up the masses of all the strings forming the junction[1].

such a conguration of 7-branes arises in the special limit of f-theory compactication
on elliptically bered k3 [6] when the size of the base is large, and when the relative

distances between the three 7-branes representing the d7-brane o7-plane system are
much smaller than the distance between any of these three 7-branes and any of the other

twenty one 7-branes. the stability of this junction j can be argued as follows. first of
all, it is charged under a u(1) gauge eld living on the abc 7-brane system and carries

the minimal value of charge. second, there are no bps states on the abc brane system
which carry this u(1) charge. indeed, all states of the system carrying this u(1) charge,
are non-bps, and are represented by junctions nj with n 6= 0.
in the approximation
where the length of each segment of the junction is large compared to the string length
scale ls so that the mass of the junction is given by adding the masses of the strings,
the states with n = 1 are expected to be the lowest mass ones, since in this limit the
state nj will be represented by n copies of the junction representing the state j. thus j

cannot decay into a state living on the abc system. in addition, since j carries a u(1)
charge originating from the three 7-brane system, it cannot decay into a state which lives
completely on the other 21 7-branes. if it were to decay, the decay products must include
a junction j with at least one prong extending from the abc system all the way to one
of the 21 other 7-branes. since all the 21 other 7-branes are far away, the mass of j is
necessarily much larger than that of j, and thus this decay is not possible due to energetic
reasons. this establishes the stability of j.

the above argument requires the relative distance between all the 7-branes to be large
compared to the string length scale ls so that the dominant contribution to the mass of
the state comes from the classical mass of the junction. however, this condition can be
relaxed a little. suppose that the three special 7 branes are very close to each other, so
that their separations are of the order of, or are much smaller than ls. then, since stringy
corrections could be of order l1
the computation of masses of the localized non-bps

s

2throughout this paper we shall refer to both string junctions and string networks, as junctions.
3string junctions have been used in [5] to construct non-bps states on the 3-brane  7-brane system.

3

junctions living on the abc brane system is dicult, and one may not be able to decide
which of the non-bps junctions is the stable one against decay within this system.4 but
there will be at least one stable state,  the one with minimum mass carrying the u(1)
charge. since this state has mass of order l1
s , stringy corrections will not invalidate the
conclusion of stability against decay using the faraway branes as long as the distance

between the three isolated branes and every one of the twenty one other 7-branes is much
larger than ls. we will therefore have a stable non-bps state.

in this paper we generalize this construction to other limits of f-theory compacti-
cation on k3. the basic idea will be as follows. we rst consider a limit of f-theory
compactication where a subset of (24 r) 7-branes are far away from a set of r 7-branes.
we shall call the latter a set of isolated 7-branes. in this case in analysing the stability

of any state which lives solely on the isolated branes, we can forget about the existence
of the other 7-branes, and study if the state can decay into other states living on the
isolated set of 7-branes.5 then we study if this specic set of isolated branes contains a
non-bps state subject to the condition that a) it carries a (set of) u(1) charge(s), and
b) there is no combination of bps states living solely on the isolated branes which also

carries the same charge quantum number(s). in this case this isolated brane conguration
is guaranteed to contain a stable non-bps state carrying charge under this u(1) gauge

eld(s). it is of course possible to nd a set of bps states carrying same charge quantum
numbers if we include string junction congurations some of whose prongs end on the
other 7-branes, but these states are too heavy, and so it is not energetically possible for

the original non-bps state to decay into such states.

this construction of course does not exhaust all possible ways of obtaining stable

non-bps states in f-theory compactication on k3. in particular one may nd examples
where there is a non-bps state and a set of bps states whose total charge quantum

numbers match that of this non-bps state, but a detailed dynamical analysis involving
computation of the masses of each state shows that it is not energetically possible for a

non-bps state to decay into the set of bps states carrying the same set of chage quantum
numbers. we do not attempt to analyze these cases in this paper.

4fortunately in the limit when the separation between the abc branes are much smaller than ls, the
system can be described by a d7-brane o7-plane system which allows us to compute the masses, and
conclude that the state carrying the minimum u(1) charge is stable.

5again this argument would require the distance between the isolated branes and the other branes to

be much larger than ls.

4

note that if we do not consider isolated 7-brane congurations of this kind, but consider
the full set of states in f-theory on k3, then for every state carrying some specic charge

quantum number there is a set of bps states carrying the same charge quantum number,
and hence every state can in principle decay into a set of bps states unless such decays
are forbidden due to energetic reasons. this can be seen by noting that the full lattice

of junctions for f-theory on k3 (or equivalently the narain lattice[9] for heterotic string
theory on t 2) can be generated by a set of bps states.
indeed, if one takes e8  e8
heterotic string theory on t 2, then the e8  e8 part of the lattice is generated by the root
vectors of e8  e8 which represent massless gauge bosons and are bps states, whereas
the four dimensional lattice associated with t 2 is generated by bps states carrying unit
winding or momentum along either of the two directions.

our analysis proceeds in several steps.

in section 2 we begin to classify 7-brane
congurations which can be isolated. we nd two classes of 7-brane congurations of this
kind. the rst class corresponds to a conguration of 7-branes where r of the 7-branes

are at nite distance of each other and the other 7-branes can be pushed all the way to
innity.6 in this case we have a non-singular background describing only these r 7-branes;
and we call these properly isolated 7-brane congurations. the other class consists of 7-
brane congurations where r of the 7-branes are within a nite distance of each other,

and the other 7-branes are at a distance larger than l for some large number l. in this
case, however, we cannot take the l   limit and push the other branes all the way
to innity, because in this limit the string coupling constant vanishes everywhere in the

region within nite distance of the isolated branes. we call these asymptotically isolated
7-branes. we nd that the monodromy around a properly isolated brane conguration

must be an elliptic or a parabolic element of the sl(2,z) s-duality group, whereas the
monodromy around an asymptotically isolated 7-brane must be a parabolic element. in

particular, we see that 7-brane congurations with hyperbolic monodromies cannot be
isolated.

in section 3 we look for explicit examples of isolated 7-brane congurations using the
list of 7-brane congurations found in ref.[7]. in this list we nd that the 7-brane cong-

urations e6, e7, e8, h0, h1, h2, ben (1  n  9), bee0, bee1, and dn (0  n  4) satisfy

the necessary conditions for being properly isolated 7-brane congurations, and we show

6since in an f-theory background a constant rescaling of the metric does not destroy the solution, we
can start from this solution and go to other conguraions where the distance between the r 7-branes are
large or small compared to ls.

5

that these conditions are also sucient by explicitly constructing the properly isolated 7-
brane congurations of these types. the analysis is more complicated for asymptotically

isolated 7-brane congurations, and we have not attempted a thorough study of all the
congurations listed in ref.[7] to see which of them can be asymptotically isolated. how-
ever, we show the existence of 7-brane congurations of this kind based on an (n  0)
and dn (n  5) type congurations.

in section 4 we examine each of the examples of isolated 7-brane congurations found

in section 3 and look for stable non-bps states in this system. the basic idea has already
been explained before: we demand that we have one or more non-bps junctions carrying

a (set of) u(1) charge(s), and that there is no combination of bps states living on the
isolated brane system carrying the same (set of) u(1) charge(s). according to our previous

argument, this would guarantee that there is at least one stable non-bps state on the
isolated 7-brane system as long as the faraway branes are much farther than ls away.
we nd that there are three 7-brane congurations satisfying these constraints  d1,
be2 and bee1. of these d1 represents a d7-brane near an o7-plane, and be2 represents a
congurations could be argued by working in the orientifold limit. on the other hand, bee1

d7-brane near a pair of o7-planes. the existence of possible non-bps states in these

seems to represent a genuinely new example as it gives a non-bps state with no simple

perturbative interpretation.

in section 5 we study the possibility of obtaining non-bps states on non-isolable 7-
brane congurations. we construct several examples of 7-brane congurations containing

string junctions which are stable against decay within the given 7-brane congurations.
but since these 7-brane congurations are not isolable, there are other 7-branes nearby,

and these junctions could be unstable against decay into string junctions which have one
or more prongs ending on 7-branes outside this system.

as we were preparing to submit this paper, an interesting work by y. yamada and
s. k. yang appeared [10] which also gives an explicit construction of the ane exceptional

brane congurations. this substantially overlaps with section 3.2.

2 constraints on isolated congurations

various congurations of (p, q) 7-branes were studied in refs. [8, 7]. in this section we shall

analyse the conditions under which a given set of 7-branes can be considered in isolation.

6

this issue arises because we want to consider subsets of the conguration of 24 7-branes
describing f-theory on k3 [6]. we try to take an appropriate limit in the parameter space

where a chosen set of 7-branes is far away from all the other 7-branes. we shall say that
the chosen set of 7-branes can be isolated if it is possible to consider the limit in which the
largest distance between any two members of the chosen set can be made small compared

to the distance between the chosen set and any of the other 7-branes. as discussed in
the introduction, only for brane congurations that can be considered in isolation we can

reliably ascertain the existence of stable non-bps states.

our analysis of stability of non-bps states is based on classical considerations, and
thus our results are valid in the limit when the size of the s2 base transverse to the seven
branes is taken to be large compared to the string length ls. in particular, with the help
of an overall rescaling of the metric, we choose the size of the base to be suciently large
so that the distance between the isolated branes and any of the other branes is large
compared to the string length ls. in this limit, as explained in the introduction, a stable
non-bps state on the isolated 7-brane conguration cannot be rendered unstable by the
presence of the faraway branes.

our analysis will consist of two steps. in the rst step we nd constraints on mon-
odromies that can appear around an isolated conguration by requiring that all other

7-branes are at large coordinate distance away from the isolated branes. in particular, we
nd that hyperbolic monodromies are not allowed. since large coordinate distance does
not always correspond to large distance measured in the relevant metric, in the second

step we impose the condition that when distances are measured in the appropriate metric,
the isolated conguration is still far away from the remaining branes.

2.1 constraints on monodromies for isolated congurations

a conguration of 7-branes in f-theory is described by specifying a pair of polynomials f
and g in z,  the complex coordinate parametrizing the space transverse to the 7-brane.
f is a polynomial of degree 8 and g is a polynomial of degree 12. we dene:

 = 4f 3 + 27g2 .

(2.1)

then the dependence of the axion-dilaton modulus  (z) on the transverse coordinate z is

given by:

j( (z)) =

4  (24f )3



.

7

(2.2)

j( ) blows up at the zeroes of . these are the locations of the 7-branes.

we can now make more precise what we mean by isolating a set of branes. for this
note that f and g are labelled by a set of 22 parameters i. we shall consider the cases
where we can focus on a one dimensional subspace i(), parametrized by . we say that
we can isolate a set of branes if as we take the limit   0 the parameters i() of f and
g ow in such a way that a set of r roots of  remain at nite points in the z plane, while
the others move o to innity. in that case for a nite but suciently small , by using
scaling and translation in z, we can ensure that r of the zeroes of ,  which we shall
associate with the location of the isolated branes,  are within the unit disk centered at
the origin, and the faraway branes are outside a circle of radius l, also centered at the
origin, where l is some arbitrary but xed large number.

the above denition will describe an isolated set of r 7-branes in the sense described
earlier if we can show that nite (innite) coordinate distance in the z-plane corresponds
to nite (innite) distance measured in the metric used for computing the mass of a (p, q)

string stretched along a geodesic[11, 12, 13]. this must be true for all possible values of
(p, q). this constraint will give additional restrictions on the form of f and g. we shall

derive these constraints in the next subsection.

let zi denote the positions of the isolated branes and ezi the position of the faraway

branes. by using the additional freedom of simultaneously rescaling f and g by constants
2 and 3 respectively, we can bring  to the form:

 =

ryi=1
(z  zi)

24ryi=1

(1 

z

ezi

)

(2.3)

as mentioned before, for suciently small  we have |zi| < 1 for all i = 1,   r and
|ezi| > l for all i = 1,   , 24 r. as we travel (in the clockwise direction) around the set

of isolated branes, the modulus  undergoes an sl(2, z) transformation:

 

a + b
c + d

.

(2.4)

we shall call the matrix (cid:18) a b

d(cid:19) the monodromy matrix k around the isolated set of

c

7-branes. our rst task will be to compute the possible monodromy matrices k around
the isolated branes.7 for computing k we can use any contour surrounding the isolated
branes but not enclosing any faraway brane.

7throughout this and the next section we shall determine the monodromy matrix only up to an

sl(2,z) conjugation, unless mentioned otherwise.

8

we now examine the behavior of f (z) and g(z). we shall call a parameter in f or
g small, nite or large, if taking  to zero requires the parameter to go to zero, remain

bounded within a circle of nite radius in the complex plane, or grow indenitely, respec-
tively. we write f and g in the form

f (z) = f

g(z) = g

dfyi=1
(z  ui)
dgyi=1
(z  vi)

8dfyi=1
12dgyi=1

(1 

(1 

z

z

eui
evi

) ,

) ,

(2.5)

(2.6)

where we have introduced parameters ui,eui, vi,evi, entering as zeroes of f and g, and
parameters f, g entering as overall coecients. the parameters ui (1  i  df ) are
assumed to be either small or nite, while the eui (1  i  (8  df )) are assumed to
be large. similarly, vi (1  i  dg) are small or nite, and evi (1  i  (12  dg)) are

large. the above expressions for f and g are completely general. our analysis will require
investigating the nature of the parameters f and g. note that having used scaling to x

the distribution of branes implicit in  and the overall normalization of , we no longer
have any further scaling freedom to set f and/or g to specic values. the parameters f
and g can be small, nite or large. the numbers df and dg indicate the degrees of f and
g respectively, when we use only the factors associated with the small and nite roots.

we shall now introduce two contours that will help in the analysis. since we have a
bounded number of small and nite roots one can dene a nite length r/2 which is the
magnitude of the largest nite root (of f , g or ) in the limit   0. it then follows that,
for suciently small , the circle c of nite radius r contains all small and nite roots.
moreover, this circle is at a nite distance from all the small and nite roots of f , g and
from all the isolated branes. in addition, if el denotes the magnitude of the smallest large
root of f , g or , then for suciently small  we can choose another circle c, of radius
r such that r/r and el/r are arbitrarily large. this circle is both far outside the nite
and small roots, and far inside the large roots and the faraway branes. as mentioned
before we can calculate the monodromy k using c or c, since each of them only encloses
the isolated branes (note that crossing zeroes of f and g does not aect the monodromy;
however in deforming c to c we do not cross any zero of f or g).

by construction  takes nite values on c (see (2.3)).

in addition, on c, we have
f  f and g  g, by which we mean that f /f and g/g are both nite and nonzero.

9

since  = 4f 3 + 27g2, we see that both f and g cannot be small parameters. if f is
large g also must be large and vice versa. thus we need to consider the following cases

separately: 1) f small, g nite 2) f nite, g small 3) f and g both nite, and 4) f and
g both large.

1. f small, g nite: in this case on the contour c,   27g2, and hence from (2.1),
(2.2) we see that j( )  0. this gives   e2i/3 up to an sl(2,z) conjugation. the
monodromy k around c must leave this value of  xed. this gives k = (st )1
or k = 1, where we dene:

s = (cid:18) 0 1
0 (cid:19) ,

1

t = (cid:18) 1 1

0 1(cid:19) .

(2.7)

2. f nite, g small: now   4f 3 along c. this gives j( )  (24)3, and   i along c.
the monodromy around c which must leave this value of  xed is either k = s
or k = 1.

3. f and g nite:

in this case we shall compute k using the contour c. on c
the functions f and g are well approximated by their overall coecients f and g

together with the factors containing the small and nite roots. there are several
subcases to be considered:

(a) 3df 6= 2dg: depending on whether 3df > 2dg or 3df < 2dg, f or g will be the
dominant contribution to . in the rst case   i on c, and k = s or
k = 1. in the second case   e2i/3 on c and k = (st )1 or k = 1.
(b) 3df = 2dg. in this case there are two possibilities: r < 3df and r = 3df . since
 = 4f 3 + 27g2, and f and g are approximated by polynomials of degree df
and dg respectively, the approximation to  is a polynomial of degree at most
3df (= 2dq). hence r > 3df is not possible.
i. r < 3df : in this case on c we have

j( ) = 4(24f )3/  z3df r .

since j( ) is large on c, we can use

j( )  e2i ,
10

(2.8)

(2.9)

to conclude that

  (3df  r)

1
2i

ln z + constant .

(2.10)

this implies k = t 3df r. note that the power of t is positive.

ii. r = 3df : in this case f 3/ goes to some constant on c. thus  goes to
a constant. since f 3/ and g2/ are both non-vanishing and nite on
c, the constant  is not (an sl(2,z) conjugate of) i, e2i/3 or i. the
monodromy along c must leave xed this constant value of  . the only
possibility is k = 1. this case is identical to (several copies of) the d4
case [2].

4. f and g large. in this case along c the function f is large but  is nite. thus
we can use eq.(2.9) to conclude that im( ) must be large along c. the monodromy
around c must preserve this condition. this gives k = t k for some integer k
( < k < ).

note that in cases 1, 2 and 3, the functions f , g and  remain well dened in the
  0 limit, since they all approach nite values for nite z in the   0 limit, and each
of them only has a nite number of isolated zeroes in the nite z plane. in these cases
even when we set  = 0,  (z) is well dened in the sense that it is nite (with im( ) > 0)

for nite z except at isolated points which are the locations of the 7-branes. on the other
hand, in case 4, f and g do not approach a nite value for nite z as   0, since the
multiplicative factors f and g blow up in this limit. since j( )  f 3/ and  is bounded
for any nite z, for  = 0 we will have im( ) =  at every nite point in the z plane
except at the zeroes of f . since the string coupling constant is given by the inverse of the

imaginary part of  , we see that in this case the string coupling approaches zero at every
nite point in the z plane except at the zeroes of f . this is a singular conguration. but

since in order to get 7-brane congurations admitting stable non-bps states we do not
need to actually set  = 0, but only need to take  suciently small, even these kind
of 7-brane congurations are potentially good candidates for admitting stable non-bps

states in their spectrum.

2.2 constraints from large distance separation

let us now study the constraints coming from the requirement that nite (large) separa-

tion in the coordinate z correspond to nite (large) separation measured in the appropriate
metric used in computing the mass of a string junction living on the 7-brane system. up

to an arbitrary constant multiplicative factor, this metric used in computing the mass of
a (p, q) string is given by [11]:

dsp,q = |p + q||( )|2

ryi=1|z  zi| 1

12 |dz| ,

(2.11)

where zi, as before, denote the locations of the isolated 7-branes. first let us consider
the cases 1-3 discussed above. in these cases we can set  = 0 from the beginning. now

 is nite everywhere in the z-plane except at the locations of the 7-branes, and possibly
at z = . the metric of a (p, q)-string is known to be nite near a (p, q)-seven brane.
thus it is nite at all nite points in the z-plane, and hence nite coordinate distance
will correspond to nite distance measured in the metric (2.11).8 thus if we can show
that innite coordinate distance corresponds to innite distance when measured in the
metric (2.11), for any (p, q) values, we would have shown that nite (large) separation in
the z-coordinate system corresponds to nite (large) separation in the metric (2.11). the
main issue here is whether the point z =  is innite or nite distance away from nite
points in the z-plane. for this we note that for large |z|, (2.11) reduces to

dsp,q  |p + q||( )|2 |z| r

12|dz| .

(2.16)

since |p + q| either approaches a nite value or grows logarithmically as |z|  , we see
that the point z =  is at innite distance measured in the metric (2.16) if

finally we turn to case 4. in this case im( ) is large for nite z, and hence

(2.21)

in the next section we shall look for 7-brane congurations satisfying all the constraints
found in this section. for this analysis it will be useful to divide the possible set of isolable

7-brane congurations into two classes. since in cases 1, 2 and 3, we can actually set
 = 0 and get a well dened function  (z), we shall call these congurations properly

isolated 7-brane congurations. on the other hand in case 4 we only get isolated 7-brane
congurations for small but non-zero . if we try to push all the other 7-branes all the
way to innity by taking the   0 limit, im( ) blows up for all nite z except at
isolated points. we shall refer to these congurations as asymptotically isolated 7-brane
congurations. as discussed earlier, both kinds of isolated 7-brane congurations are

potentially relevant for nding stable non-bps states.

13

3 constructing the isolated congurations

our analysis so far gives constraints on monodromies for isolated 7-brane congurations,
but does not guarantee that given a 7-brane conguration with one of these monodromies,

it can always be isolated. we can now use table 5 of [7] to identify the brane congurations
giving such monodromies. brane congurations were classied by their monodromy matri-
ces k into elliptic (|t r(k)| < 2), parabolic (|t r(k)| = 2) and hyperbolic (|t r(k)| > 2)
type. s and (st )1 are examples of elliptic monodromy, whereas t k for any integer
k are examples of parabolic monodromy. from our analysis we see that only 7-brane

congurations with elliptic and parabolic monodromies can be possibly isolated.

let us rst consider 7-brane congurations which can be properly isolated. in this

case we can have elliptic monodromies coming from cases 1, 2 or 3(a), and parabolic
monodromies coming from cases 1, 2, 3(a) or 3(b) of section 2.1.
in the elliptic cases

equation (2.13) must be satised. from table 5 of ref.[7] we see that with fewer than 12
7-branes we have the congurations: e6, e7, e8, h0, h1, and h2. parabolic cases coming
from cases 1, 2, 3(a) and 3(b) have monodromy t k with k  0. furthermore, we need
to satisfy (2.17). in this class we nd ben (9  n  1), bee1, bee0, and dn (4  n  0). we

shall explicitly construct f and g for each of these elliptic and parabolic congurations,

thereby proving that all these congurations can be properly isolated. of these, the ones
with elliptic monodromy, and the d4 conguration can be collapsed to a single point, but
none of the other congurations with parabolic monodromy can be collapsed to a single
point.

asymptotically isolated congurations originating from case 4 in section 2.1 can have
monodromy t k where k is any integer. there are several congurations with mon-
odromies of this form. for example, after excluding the properly isolated congurations,
we have an (n  0), dn (n > 4), ben (n > 9), three copies of d0 etc.10 but in this

case a complete analysis of which of these congurations can actually be isolated is more

dicult, since these congurations can be reached only as a limit. however, we do give
proof of existence of a class of such congurations based on resolutions of dn (n  5)
and an (n  0) singularities.

we begin our analysis with the properly isolated congurations.

10two copies of d0 is equivalent to be1[7].

3.1 elliptic cases

e6: this contains eight 7-branes and has monodromy (st )1.11 the fact that there
are eight 7-branes means that for a properly isolated 7-brane conguration of this type,
 is a polynomial of degree 8. the monodromy matrix leaves xed the point  = e2i/3.
hence far away from the seven brane conguration  must approach e2i/3, and j( ) must
vanish. this shows that f 3 must be a polynomial of degree < 8. this gives the following
constraints:

deg(f )  2,

deg(g) = 4 .

(3.22)

there are no further constraints on f and g. in order to prove that this really describes
an e6 conguration we note that since the parameter space is connected, it is enough
to show that any one point in the parameter space describes an e6 conguration. if we
consider the special case where f = 0 and g = z4, then this describes an e6 singularity,
and hence certainly represents an e6 type 7-brane conguration. thus any pair of f and
g satisfying (3.22) gives a properly isolated 7-brane conguration of e6 type. this shows
that the e6 conguration can be isolated.12

e7: this contains nine 7-branes, and has monodromy s. thus  is a polynomial of
degree 9, and  approaches i far away from the 7-branes. the latter condition tells us
that g2/ must vanish suciently far away from the 7-branes, and hence g2 must have
degree < 9. this gives the following necessary conditions for a properly isolated 7-brane
conguration of e7 type:

deg(f ) = 3,

deg(g)  4 .

(3.23)

taking f (z) = z3 and g(z) = 0 we get a collapsed conguration with e7 singularity. this
shows that eqs.(3.23) are also sucient for getting an e7 conguration.

e8: this has ten 7-branes and has monodromy (st ). following the same analysis
as the e6 case we nd that the necessary and sucient condition for having a properly
isolated 7-brane conguration of this type is:

deg(f )  3,

deg(g) = 5 .

(3.24)

h0: this has two 7-branes and has monodromy (st )1. following the same analysis

11again in this section we continue to use monodromies that are only xed up to sl(2,z).
12curves for e6, e7, and e8 were constructed in [18] in the context of n = 2 supersymmetric four

dimensional gauge theories with global exceptional symmetries.

15

as the e6 case we nd,

deg(f )  0,

deg(g) = 1 .

(3.25)

here deg(f )  0 means that f can be either a constant or zero.

h1: this has three 7-branes and has monodromy (s)1. following the same analysis

as the e7 case we nd,

deg(f ) = 1,

deg(g)  1 .

(3.26)

h2: this has four 7-branes and has monodromy (st ). following the same analysis

as the e6 case we nd,

deg(f )  1,

deg(g) = 2 .

(3.27)

this nishes all the elliptic cases. we now turn to the parabolic cases.

3.2 properly isolated parabolic cases

here we must deal with two series of congurations. one series carries ane exceptional

algebras and the other series carries orthogonal algebras. we begin with:

3.2.1 the exceptional series ben
be9: this has twelve 7-branes and its monodromy is the identity. this corresponds to

deg(f )  4,

deg(g)  6 ,

deg() = 12.

(3.28)

indeed, choosing arbitrary fourth order and sixth order polynomials for f and g respec-
tively, it is clear that for large z we can get arbitrary constant values of  . only k = 1
can leave such values invariant. on the other hand, it follows from the arguments of
ref.[7], section 4 that twelve 7-branes cannot produce k = 1. we must therefore have
k = 1. this conguration arises from two copies of the d4 case discussed in [2].

if we dene the coecients fk, gk and dk through the relations:

4xk=0
f (z)  (4)1/3f (z) =
6xk=0
g(z)  (27)1/2g(z) =
12xk=0

  f

+ g 2 =

fkzk

gkzk

dkzk ,

16

(3.29)

then, in order to get be9 one must have d12 6= 0, which requires g2
ben (2  n  8), bee1, bee0: the ben conguration has (n + 3) seven branes, and has

monodromy t 9n. thus for a properly isolated brane conguration of this kind,  is a
polynomial of degree (n + 3), and j( ) for large but nite z behaves as

4 to be non-zero.

6  f 3

j( )  z9n .

(3.30)

using (2.1), (2.2) we see that f 3  z12, and g2  z12 for large |z|. thus f is a polynomial
of degree 4 and g is a polynomial of degree 6. let us introduce the coecients of expansion
fk, gk through the relations (3.29). using the freedom of shifting z, and the freedom of
scaling f and g by 2 and 3 respectively for any complex number , we set

f0 = 0,

f4 = 1 .

(3.31)

this still leaves a residual rescaling freedom where we scale g by 1 and leave f unchanged;
we shall use this later. we are also left with the freedom of scaling z by a complex number
k together with a compensating scaling f  k 4f , g  k 6g so as to preserve the f4 = 1
condition. we shall also make use of this later.
in order to get the ben conguration, we need to ensure that the coecients dk dened
in eq.(3.29) vanish for k  (n + 4), and that dn+3 does not vanish. we shall begin by
describing the solution for be2. first of all, requiring the coecient d12 to vanish we get
g6 = 1. we can now use the residual scaling freedom g  g, f  f to set,

now by equating the coecients of d11, . . . d6 to 0, we get13:

g6 = 1  bg6 .

13this calculation is straightforward but complicated, and has been done with the help of the algebraic

manipulator programme maple.

this determines the parameters gi in terms of three independent parameters f1, f2, f3. in

order to have an be2 conguration we must also require d5 to be non-zero. a straightfor-

ward computation gives:

d5 =

(8f1  4f2f3 + f 3

3 )(16f 2

2 + 16f1f3  16f2f 2

3 + 3f 4

3 ) .

(3.39)

thus the most general properly isolated be2 conguration is labelled by three parameters
f1, . . . f3 satisfying the inequality d5 6= 0. of these three parameters one is redundant
due to the freedom of scaling of z. using this freedom, we can require the d5 given in
(3.39) to be equal to (3/1024). this gives a two parameter family of be2 congurations.

(3.40)

the construction of properly isolated ben congurations with 2 < n < 9 follows triv-
ially. in this case we require dk to vanish for k  (n + 4), and dn+3 to be non-zero. thus
we need to satisfy the rst (9  n) of the equations (3.32)-(3.38), and also require that
the left hand side minus the right hand side of the (10  n)th equation (gn3  bgn3) be

non-zero, which we can set equal to (+1) by using the freedom of rescaling z. thus the
general solution is parametrized by (n + 1) parameters f1, . . . f3, g0, . . . gn3 subject to one
gauge xing condition, which determines gn3 in terms of the other parameters. using
the gauge xing condition gn3  gn3 = 1, the explicit solution is given by

be9>n>2 :

f (z) = f1z + f2z2 + f3z3 + z4 ,

g(z) = g6 z6 +    + gn2zn2 + (1 + gn3)zn3 +

n4xk=0

gkzk ,

(3.41)

where g6 = 1, and the other gn are given in (3.33)-(3.38). g0, . . . gn4 are arbitrary.

let us now turn to the case of be1. in this case we need to satisfy eqs.(3.32)-(3.38),

together with d5 = 0. it follows from (3.39) that we need

(8f1  4f2f3 + f 3

3 )(16f 2

2 + 16f1f3  16f2f 2

3 + 3f 4

3 ) = 0 .

(3.42)

note that this equation contains two factors. furthermore, it is straightforward to see

that if we require both factors to vanish simultaneously, then  vanishes identically, and
hence we have an unphysical solution.

thus it appears that in the parameter space labelled by f1, f2, and f3, there are two
physically disconnected regions which give properly isolated 7-brane congurations with

the same number of 7-branes and the same monodromy as the be1 conguration:

(8f1  4f2f3 + f 3

3 ) = 0 ,

or

(16f 2

2 + 16f1f3  16f2f 2

3 + 3f 4

3 ) = 0 .

(3.43)

(3.44)

it turns out that among the congurations of 7-branes listed in table 5 of [7] there is

precisely one more conguration with the same monodromy and the same number of 7-

branes as the be1 conguration, namely the bee1 conguration. thus we expect to identify
one of the branches of (3.42) with bee1, and the other branch with be1. let us begin with

the rst branch, given by equation (3.43) which we can use to solve for f1 as

f1 =

we then have d4 = 12(s  1)4, and therefore we should get the desired conguration
when s 6= 1. at this stage we can write every coecient in terms of s. as we will explain
shortly, this is be1. we then have

(3.46)

be1 :

f(z) = z4 + 4z3 + 4s z2 + 8(s  1) z ,
g(z) = z6 + 6z5 + 6(s + 1)z4 + (24s  16) z3

(be1) = 4(s  1)4(cid:16)3z4  12z3  12s z2  24(s  1) z + 4(s  1)2(cid:17)

let us now conrm that this is be1. to this end we recall that the be1 brane conguration

is bcbc and either the b or the c branes can be brought together to dene an a1
singularity. indeed, we found that letting

z = 1 + y ,

s =

equations (3.47) and (3.48) become

) y2  (12 + 63) y4 + y6

this is an a1 singularity at y = 0; indeed, at this point we have ord(f ) = ord(g) = 0,
and ord() = 2.

this conrms that we are dealing with be1. we can perform another check. it should
not be possible to decouple a brane in this conguration, since removing any single brane
14note that this gauge condition is valid for all (f2, f3) as long as f3 6= 0, i.e. s 6= . if f3 vanishes,

then we need to choose a dierent gauge.

20

from be1 will leave a conguration with hyperbolic monodromy [7] and such conguration

(by our earlier arguments) cannot be isolated. indeed, to make the coecient of z4 in 
vanish, we must take s = 1, but this makes  vanish identically, and therefore this is not
a physical solution.15

we now begin the exploration of the second branch, indicated in (3.44). in here we

must set:

f1 =

we have two parameters f2 and f3.

then nd

it is convenient at this stage to relate them via

bee1 :

f(z) = z4 + 4z3 + 4sz2  4(s  1)(s  3)z ,
s 6= 1
g(z) = z6 + 6z5 + 6(1 + s)z4 + (22 + 36s  6s2)z3

6(s  1)(s  5)z2  12(s  2)(s  1)2 z
+2(3s  5)(s  1)3 .

and one can conrm that

(bee1) = (s  1)4(cid:16) 12(2s  3) z4  8(s2  14s + 19) z3

+24(3s2  4s  1) z2  48(3s  5)(s  2)(s  1) z
+4(3s  5)2(s  1)2(cid:17)

(3.53)

(3.54)

this is the one-parameter presentation of bee1. to conrm this end we recall that bee1
is described as ax[2,1]cx[4,1], and the a and c branes, for example, can be brought
together at z = 0. for this one must have f  z and g  z. since f  z in the above, we
must see if it is possible to set to zero the z-independent term in g. indeed, we see two
15we also need to make sure that the special point s = , where our gauge choice breaks down, does
not correspond to a decoupled brane conguration. to see this we go back to eq.(3.46) and set f3 = 0.
requiring d4 to vanish will now require f2 to vanish. this, in turn, makes f1 and all the coecients gk
for 0  k  5 to vanish. thus we get f = z 4, and g = z 6. this makes  = g2  f 3 vanish identically.
16again, this gauge condition breaks down if f3 = 0.

possibilities. the rst one, s = 1 is ruled out, since then  vanishes identically. on the
other hand we can take s = 5/3. this gives

this is indeed bee1 with an h0 singularity at z = 0.
finally, we can identify the conguration bee0 which has three 7-branes, by decoupling
a brane from bee1. it is clear that we must set to zero the coecient of z4 in  as given in

(3.54). taking s = 1 is clearly illegal, so we must take s = 3/2. in this case we nd

(3.56)

(3.58)

this concludes our proof that all the ben (1  n  9) and been (n = 0, 1) congurations

can be properly isolated.

3.2.2 the orthogonal series dn (0  n  4)
the dn conguration has monodromy t 4n and has (n + 2) 7-branes. the appropriate
f and g in these cases coincide with the corresponding functions found in ref.[15] for
n = 2 supersymmetric su(2) gauge theories with n hypermultiplets in the fundamental
representation [2]. however for completeness we shall construct these functions explicitly
here, as it does not require any extra eort.

proceeding in the same way as in the ben case, we conclude that the dn conguration
for n  4 is described by polynomials f and g of degree 2 and 3 respectively, subject to
the condition that  is a polynomial of degree (n + 2). we introduce the coecients fk,
gk and dk through the equations:

f (z)  (4)1/3f (z) =

2xk=0

fkzk

22

3xk=0
g(z)  (27)1/2g(z) =
6xk=0

   f 3 + g2 =

dkzk .

(3.59)

3 6= f 3
deg() = 6.

then for d4 the only requirement on the coecients is that g2

deg(f )  2,

deg(g)  3 ,

(3.60)

in order to get a dn conguration for n  3, dk must vanish for k  (n + 3), and dn+2
should be non-zero. this gives constraints on the coecients fn and gn. as in the ben

case, by using the freedom of shifting z and rescaling f and g we set

f0 = 0 ,

f2 = 1 .

(3.61)

instead of discussing the case of each of the dns separately, it is most convenient to start
with d0. by equating the coecients of d6, d5, d4 and d3 to zero we nd the following
constraints:

d6 = 0 :

these equations determine the coecients gk in terms of the single parameter f1. using
eqs.(3.61)-(3.65) we get d2 =  3
1 . this term must not vanish, and therefore f1 6= 0. we
can use z-scaling together with compensating f and g scalings (as before) to x f1 = 4,
while preserving f4 = 1. we then have for d0

g(z) = z3 + 6z2 + 6z  4 ,
(z) = 12z2  48z + 16.

(3.66)

the solution for dn for all other n  3 is now easily obtained. for this the coecients
gn need to satisfy the rst (4  n) equations in eq.(3.62)-(3.65), and should not satisfy
the (5  n)th of these equations. this determines the parameters gn, gn+1, . . . g3 in terms

23

of f1, and gives a strict inequality for gn1. as in the ben case, we can use the freedom
of scaling z to ensure that the dierence between the left and the right hand side of the
(5  n)th equation is 1. this gauge xing condition determines gn1. thus the general
solution is parametrized by n parameters f1, g0, . . . gn2. explicitly, the answer is:

cdn>0 :

f(z) = z2 + f1z ,

g(z) = g3 z3 +    + gnzn + (1 + gn1)zn1 +

where g3 = 1, the other gn are given in (3.63)-(3.65), and g0, . . . gn2 are arbitrary.

this nishes explicit construction of all the properly isolated 7-brane congurations.

3.3 examples of asymptotically isolated 7-brane congurations

we now turn to the asymptotically isolated 7-brane congurations. as stated earlier,
we shall not attempt to completely classify or to give explicit constructions of all such

7-brane congurations. but we shall consider two examples.

dn (n > 4): in this case the monodromy, t 4n, is proportional to a negative power
of t . from our analysis in the last section we see that the only way such a monodromy

can be obtained is in case 4, where the overall coecients in the functions f and g blow
up in the   0 limit. thus these congurations cannot be properly isolated. indeed,
for these congurations the string coupling (im( ))1 grows at large distance, and in
order to prevent it from blowing up at a nite value of z (which would represent other

7-branes), the string coupling at nite points in the z plane must be made smaller and
smaller as  approaches zero. we shall not attempt to give an explicit construction of

these congurations here. however, the existence of such congurations can be proved as
follows. we start with a collapsed dn conguration at z = 0 which is known to exist for
n  4, and resolve the singularity slightly so that the branes in the dn conguration are
located at z   for some small number . now we can rescale z by (1/) to put these
branes at nite values of z. this takes all the other branes to large values of z.

in order to verify that these congurations satisfy condition (2.21), we note that at a
dn singularity f (z) has a double zero. thus, after resolving the singularity and rescaling,
f (z) has two zeroes at nite z. this gives df = 2, which satises the inequality (2.21).

this proves the existence of asymptotically isolated dn congurations for n > 4.

24

an: this conguration has (n + 1) 7-branes and has monodromy t (n+1). thus it
also belongs to the class of 7-branes which can only be asymptotically isolated. again

we shall not discuss explicit construction of these congurations. the existence of such
congurations can be proved in the same way as the dn case for n > 4 by resolving a
conguration with an singularity, followed by a scaling of z. for an an singularity f (z)
has no zeroes at the location of the singularity. thus after resolution of the singularity
and appropriate rescaling, there will be no zero of f at a nite value of z. this gives
df = 0, which satises (2.21).

4 brane congurations with stable non-bps states

in the present section we investigate which 7-brane congurations support stable non-bps
states. such states take the form of string junctions extending between the seven branes.17
we will focus on brane congurations that can be isolated in the sense discussed in the
previous sections. unless the brane conguration can be isolated we cannot reliably
ascertain the stability of the candidate states.
in a later section we will discuss some

aspects of non-isolable congurations and their potentially stable non-bps states.

once we focus on a particular brane conguration, we only examine string junctions

joining 7-branes of that conguration. we call these localized junctions, since they do not
carry away charge to some remote 3-brane or to another set of 7-branes. we now claim

that a string junction j on such 7-brane conguration corresponds to a possibly stable
non-bps state if:
(i) the associated homology cycle j satises j2 < 2.
(ii) j 6= pi niji, where ji are homology cycles satisfying j2

i  2 and ni are arbitrary

integers.

let us rst examine the rst condition. recall that in f-theory on an elliptically bered
k3 over base s2, a string junction joining type iib seven-branes on s2 can be associated
to a two cycle in k3. this cycle, being boundaryless, corresponds to an element of the

second homology class of k3. we use the symbol j to denote interchangeably the junction
and the associated homology cycle. we also denote by j2 the self-intersection number

17when we refer to a junction corresponding to a specic vector in the junction lattice, it corresponds
to the minimal mass conguration among a whole set of junctions which can be continuously deformed
to each other by manipulations of the form discussed in [3] and [4].

25

it is well-known that in k3 any cycle with j2 = 2g  2 (g  0) has a
of the cycle.
holomorphic representative of genus g. that representative denes a bps junction. on
the other hand, when j2 < 2 the cycle has no holomorphic representative, and the
associated junction is never bps. thus the rst condition guarantees that the state is not
bps.18

let us now consider the second condition. suppose j = pi niji, where ji are homology
cycles satisfying j2
i  2 and ni are some integers. the equality of homology cycles implies
that whatever charges j carries they are also carried by the total set of states associated
to the right hand side. since all states in the right hand side are bps ( j2
i  2) the
decay of j into stable bps states cannot be ruled out by charge conservation. therefore,
condition (ii) ensures that the state cannot decay into stable bps states. of course, even

if condition (ii) is not satised, the non-bps state will be stable if its mass is lower than
the sum of the masses of the possible product states. but this requires a detailed study
of the masses of various states. we do not attempt to carry out such analysis here.

in general, a brane conguration will admit many or innite number of possibly stable
non-bps states, namely states satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). such states may decay
into each other, but there will be at least one state  the lightest of the possibly non-bps
stable states  or perhaps more that will be genuinely stable non-bps state(s). which
particular states are stable, and the number of such states, may vary as we change the
parameters labelling the isolated 7-brane conguration.

given a 7-brane conguration with (n + 2) branes, the fact that the junction does not
carry away charge imposes two conditions (unless all branes are mutually local)  one
corresponding to the d-string charge and another corresponding to the fundamental string
charge  and therefore the set of localized junctions is spanned by n linearly independent
junctions. if one identies a semisimple algebra of rank n on this brane conguration

there cannot be stable non-bps states. indeed, having identied a rank n semisimple
algebra means having identied a set of n linearly independent localized bps junctions
representing the simple roots of the algebra[8, 7]. this is therefore a basis for the set of

all localized junctions, and therefore any junction can be written as some integral linear
combination of junctions that are bps, in violation of condition (ii). what one needs is

18this can also be seen in the dual heterotic string theory on t 2 as follows. in the heterotic description
j corresponds to a vector on the narain lattice[9] and j2 corresponds to its squared norm. since in the
heterotic string theory there are no bps states with j2 < 2, we see string junctions with j2 < 2
cannot be bps.

junctions do not span the lattice of localized junctions.

series and nd the cases that can give rise to possibly stable non-bps states. we follow
the convention of refs.[8, 7] of denoting by xp,q the (p, q) 7-brane with monodromy k =

we shall rst examine the basic realizations of the (extended) a, d, e, be and h
1  pq(cid:19), and dene special 7-branes a, b and c as a = x[1,0], b = x[1,1]

and c = x[1,1]. the monodromy of a brane conguration containing a product of xp,qs
is obtained by multiplying the individual monodromy matrices in opposite order.

(cid:18) 1 + pq p2

 the an series (n  1). these congurations are special in that all branes are mutually
local; the conguration is produced by (n + 1) a branes. with just one charge conser-

vation condition corresponding to the fundamental string charge, localized junctions are
spanned by n basis elements. the n junctions joining ai to ai+1 represent the su(n + 1)
roots and span the lattice of localized junctions. thus (ii) cannot be satised.
 the dn series (n  0). these brane congurations are dn = an bc. for the case
d0, which only has two branes, there are no localized junctions. the conguration d1
carries a u(1) algebra only and thus has a candidate non-bps state. on the other hand
for dn 2 the algebra is semisimple and therefore there are no possibly stable non-bps
states.

on the other hand all these give semisimple algebras so (ii) is not satised.

 the hn (n  0). only hn 3 can be isolated. (h3 = d3). this series is realized as
hn = an +1c and the algebra is semisimple for all n  1. the remaining case, h0, has
no localized junctions.
 the en series. here we have the two realizations en = an 1bcc or en = an x[2,1]c,
which are equivalent for n  2. here e5(= d5), e6, e7, e8 and e9 = be8 can be isolated.
 the ben series. once more we have the two realizations ben = an 1bccx[3,1] (n 
1) and ben = an x[2,1]cx[4,1] (n  0), which are again equivalent for n  2. all
these congurations can be isolated at least for n  9, and correspond to parabolic
monodromies. for n  3 one identies semisimple ane algebras and thus no possibly
stable non-bps states. both be2 and be1 carry ane u(1) factors and thus are candidates

for having possibly stable non-bps states.

in conclusion, the conditions of isolation, plus (i) and (ii) have restricted the list to the

27

cases of d1, be1, and be2. we will now examine these cases in detail and conrm that they

have collections of possibly stable non-bps states, and therefore some genuinely stable

non-bps states.

4.1 case of d1.

the conguration here is abc and having mutually nonlocal branes the lattice of
localized junctions is one dimensional. this case is identical to a d7-brane o7-plane

system analyzed in ref.[1]. using the conditions of charge conservation one readily nds
that this lattice is spanned by the minimal proper junction j = 2a  b  c. here we are
following the convention of [8, 7] that a junction x[p,q] denotes a (p, q) string departing
from the x[p,q] 7-brane and going to . we can easily verify that j satises conditions (i)
and (ii). indeed, using the rule[17] that each elementary junction x[p,q] has self-intersection
1, and that the intersection number of a junction x[p,q] with another junction x[p,q] to
its right is 1
2(pq  qp), we get j2 = 4, and therefore condition (i) is satised. (the
junction j corresponds to two strings departing the a brane and meeting after going
in this picture the self-intersection is manifestly (4).)
around the b and c branes.
since any localized junction must be a multiple of the minimal junction j, any junction
must satisfy condition (i) and therefore there are no bps junctions in this conguration.
as a consequence condition (ii) is also satised. the states (nj), for n 6= 0 are all possibly
stable non-bps states. in the limit when the separations between the 7-branes are large

compared to the string length scale, the mass of a string junction can be computed reliably
by integrating the tension along the various segments of the junction. in this classical
limit the minimal mass conguration in the class of nj corresponds to n copies of the

minimal mass junction in the class of j. thus the mass of the former is approximately
n times the mass of the latter. thus the minimal charged states j are genuinely stable
non-bps. these were identied in [1].

4.2 case of ce1

this is the brane conguration having the following four seven branes (ref.[7], eqn.(3.10))

be1 = ax[2,1]cx[4,1] = abe0 = e1x[4,1]

(4.1)

we have written it in two ways; as an enhancement of be0, and as an anization of ee1.

given that we have four seven-branes we must have two junctions spanning the lattice of

28

localized junctions. we claim that the following is a basis for localized junctions of be1:

j = 3a  x[2,1]  c ,
 = x[2,1] + 2c  x[4,1] ,

j2 = 8
2 = 0 ,

  j = 0 .

(4.2)

(4.3)

the physical interpretation of these junctions can be found by considering the subcon-

linear independence is manifest, j is supported on the a brane while  is not,  is
supported on the x[4,1] brane, while j is not. after imposing the constraint that no d- or
fundamental string charge ows to innity, any arbitrary junction pa+qx[2,1]+rc+sx[4,1],
with integers p, q, r, s, can be expressed as (r + 2s)j  s. this establishes that (j, )
form a basis for the localized junctions of bee1.
gurations. indeed, the localized junctions of ee1 = ax[2,1]c make a one-dimensional
of charge (p, q) = (1, 0) surrounding the conguration be0 (ref.[7], eqn.(3.11)). this
picture makes it manifest that 2 = 0, a fact that guarantees that this junction arises
from a holomorphic cycle of genus one and is therefore bps [16]. having charge (1, 0)
the junction  can be moved across the remaining a brane and be presented as a loop
surrounding the complete be1 conguration.19 this makes j   = 0 manifest.

lattice spanned by j. on the other hand the junction  can be presented as string loop

q, = 8q2, no junction with
support on the a brane can be bps.  is the basis of bps junctions. thus the junctions
jq, with q 6= 0 are all possibly stable non-bps states. among all such states there will be
at least one lowest mass state jq0,0 that is a genuinely stable non-bps state. the precise
in fact, as we change
value of (q0, 0), however, is not determined by this argument.

since the arbitrary junction jq, = qj +  satises j2

discrete jumps. note that for a xed q the non-bps states jq, for all values of  generate

the parameters labelling the isolated bee1 conguration, the values of (q0, 0) can undergo
a (level zero) representation of the du(1) algebra carried by the bee1 conguration. since

this conguration is non-collapsible the ane symmetry is only spectrum generating, and
states with dierent values of  will typically have dierent masses and dierent stability
properties.

19in fact such loop is the loop of the ben conguration for all n .

29

4.3 case of ce2

this is the conguration described in ref.[7], eqn.(3.7):

be2 = abccx[3,1] = e2x[3,1] = abcbc

(4.4)

expressed also as the enhancement of e2. given that we have 5 seven-branes we expect
three junctions to span the lattice of localized junctions. we claim that the basis of three
junctions can be chosen to be

j =

j =

 =

c1  c2 ,
2a  b  c1 ,
b + c1 + c2  x[3,1] ,

with

j2 = 2, j2

 = 4,

()2 = 0,

j  j = 1,

j   = j   = 0 .

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

to see that this is a basis, we note that an arbitrary junction of the form pa + qb + rc1 +
sc2 + t x[3,1], with integers p, q, r, s, t, and satisfying the condition for d- and fundamental
string charge localization, can be expressed as (r + s + 2t)j  (s + t)j  t.

the set of localized junctions of the e2 sub-conguration is spanned by j and j. this
carries an su(2) u(1). j corresponds to the root of the su(2) factor and j is associated
to the u(1) factor. we also introduce j+ = 2a  b  c2. the states j form a doublet of
the su(2) satisfying

j  j = 1 , j2

 = 4

(4.9)
the  junction is a (1, 0) loop surrounding the conguration (ref.[7], eqn.(3.9)). this
explains why j   = j   = 0.
we now claim that no junction in be2 with support in the a brane can be bps. indeed,
jn,m, = nj + mj +   j2 = 4n2 2m2 + 2mn = (m n)2  3n2 m2 . (4.10)
thus j2 < 2 for any non-zero integer n. thus junctions in be2 with support on the

a brane satisfy (i) and (ii), and are possibly stable non-bps states. the u(1) charge is

with

measured by the number of prongs on the a brane.

the su(2) symmetry is exact when the two c branes coincide. in this case j would
make a doublet of possibly stable non-bps states. the possibly non-bps su(2) singlet

30

of minimal u(1) charge is readily shown to be the junction j0 = 2j + j +  = 4a 
2b  c1  c2 + . it carries twice the u(1) charge of any member of the doublet. we
can construct possibly non-bps states in higher representations of su(2) in a similar
manner. from the structure of the lattice it is easy to see that odd values of the u(1)
charge must be associated to su(2) representations in the conjugacy of the doublet, while

even u(1) charges must be associated to su(2) representations in the conjugacy class of
the adjoint. once we x a u(1) and an su(2) representation, the states jn,m, for all values

of  generate a (level zero) representation of the ane ( ba1  du(1)/ ) algebra of the be2

conguration. which of these congurations represent genuinely stable non-bps state is

a detailed dynamical question which we shall not address.

finally we note that this conguration represents a single d7-brane near a pair of

o7-planes. this is seen in the last presentation given in (4.4). the a brane represents a
d7-brane, while each of the bc factors represents an o7-plane.

5 non-bps states on non-isolable congurations

the strategy that we have used so far in our search for stable non-bps states consists of
two steps. first we need a subset of 7-branes in f-theory on k3 such that there are non-

bps junctions living on this subset of branes which are stable against decay into other
states living inside the same subsystem. second, we need to ensure that these states are

also stable against decay into junctions with one or more prongs on the 7-branes external
to this subsystem.

the second condition requires that this subset of branes can be isolated and was

the subject of study in sections 2 and 3.
in this section we shall search for 7-brane
congurations which satisfy the rst condition and not the second. this would ensure

that the non-bps states living on this subsystem are stable against decay into bps states
living on the same subsystem, but could be unstable against decay into junctions with

prongs on the external 7-branes. at present the signicance of such brane congurations
is not totally clear. however these congurations could be the starting point in our search

for 7-brane congurations which admit non-bps states which are stable due to dynamical
reasons, namely that their mass is smaller (but not much smaller) than the possible decay
products.

we shall begin by discussing two examples which we already encountered in section

31

brane system. when the relative separation between the branes is large, this corresponds

4. the rst example will be that of an ee1 conguration. this is generated by j dened
in eq.(4.2). since j2 = 8, any state of the form nj is non-bps. the minimum mass
state in this family will be stable against decay into other states living solely inside the ee1
to the junction j. from [8] we know that for ee1, t r(k) = 6. since the monodromy
is hyperbolic, the ee1 conguration cannot be isolated.
the second example is that of e2. this is generated by the junctions j and j dened
in eq.(4.5). any junction of the form jm,n = nj+mj has j2 = (mn)23n2m2 < 2
for n 6= 0. thus there should be at least one non-bps state on this system with component
along j which is stable against decay into other states living solely inside e2. again
we see from ref.[8] that in this case t r(k) = 5, and hence this conguration cannot be
isolated.

we shall consider two more examples. the rst example will be an arbitrary congura-
tion of three seven branes. the second example will be that of a four 7-brane conguration
carrying a u(1)  u(1) algebra.
non-bps states on three 7-branes by an sl(2,z) transformation, any three 7-brane con-
guration can be put in the form axx where x is a [p, q] brane, and x is a [p, q]
brane. we also require q 6= 0 and q 6= 0, as well as [p, q] 6= [p, q], for otherwise we have
at least two mutually local branes and there will be bps states carrying this u(1) charge
into which a possible non-bps state can decay. without loss of generality we can also
assume that both q and q are positive. dene

the general junction is

 = pq  qp .

j = qaa + qx + qx ,

and using charge conservation to solve for qa and q in terms of q, we nd

j = 

q
q a + q x 

qq
q x .

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

since q/q and qq/q could be fractional, this junction is not necessarily proper. to
address this issue, let us dene  = gcd(q, q) and let q = q0. one must then choose
q = q0 to get the minimal proper junction. indeed, this gives q/q = 1/ and we get

j =

1

(cid:16) a + qx  q x(cid:17) .

32

(5.4)

the self-intersection is readily found to be

j2 = 

1

2(cid:16)2 + q2 + q2 + qq(cid:17) ,

 = gcd(q, q),  = pq  qp .

(5.5)

each of the terms contributing to j2 is now an integer. we can easily choose p, q, p, q
such that j2 given above is < 2, so that all charged states living on this brane system
are non-bps states. the lightest of them will be stable against decay into other states

within this system.

it is useful to write this in a more symmetric form. let zi denote as usual the elemen-
tary junction joining the i-th 7-brane to . using the notation of [8], sect.2.1, we dene
zij = zi  zj = (piqj  qipj), where (pi, qi) denotes the i-th 7-brane. thus we have, in the
present case, z12 = q, z23 = , z31 = q, and moreover  = gcd(z12, z23, z31). we thus
have

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

j2 = 

1

2(cid:16)z2

12 + z2

23 + z2

31  z12z23z31(cid:17) .

eqn. (2.7) of [8] for three 7-branes gives:

from this we see that

31 + z12z23z31 .

trk = 2  z2

23  z2

12  z2
2(cid:16)trk  2(cid:17) .

1

j2 =

since in order to get a non-bps junction we need j2 < 2, we must have

trk < 2(1  2) .

thus we see that except when  = 1, all three 7-brane congurations with stable non-bps
states will have trk < 2, and thus have negative hyperbolic monodromies. when  = 1,
one must have trk < 0. as table 5 of [7] indicates, there is no three 7-brane conguration
with trk = 1,  a fact that is not hard to prove. the isolable conguration d1
corresponds to the case trk = 2. the non-isolable three 7-brane conguration e1
corresponds to the case trk = 6.
a case with u(1)  u(1) while refs. [8, 7] mostly searched for congurations with large
symmetry algebras, it is clearly possible to put together many branes and still fail to nd
any enlarged semi-simple algebra. in such cases we must get u(1) factors. we illustrate

this by considering a brane conguration with four 7-branes, which has no charged bps
states. the brane conguration is

x[1,2] abc ,

33

(5.10)

which is obtained by adding the x[1,2] brane to the d1 conguration. since the lattice
of localized junctions should be two-dimensional we expect to nd two u(1)s. one can

show that the following is a basis for localized junctions:

these satisfy

j1 = 2a + b + c
j2 = a + b  c + x

j2
1 = 4 , j2

2 = 4 , j1  j2 = 0 ,

(5.11)

(5.12)

(5.13)

and therefore there are no bps states on this brane conguration carrying either of these
u(1) charges. this shows that this brane conguration has non-bps junctions which

are stable against decay within this brane system. the general localized junction on this
brane conguration would be j = q1j1 +q2j2, where q1 and q2 are the two u(1) charges
of the junction. for this conguration trk = 14, conrming that it cannot be isolated.
