abstract

compact type iib d = 4, n = 1 orientifolds have certain u (1) -model symmetries

at the level of the eective lagrangian. these symmetries are generically anomalous.

we study the particular case of zn orientifolds and nd that these anomalies may be

cancelled by a generalized green-schwarz mechanism. this mechanism works by the

exchange of twisted rr-elds associated to the orbifold singularities and it requires

the mixing between twisted and untwisted moduli of the orbifold. as a consequence,

the fayet-iliopoulos terms which are present for the gauged anomalous u (1)s of the

models get an additional untwisted modulus dependent piece at the tree level.

1 introduction

the low-energy dynamics of moduli elds in string theory is described by a non-linear

-model. the isometries of the corresponding target space appear as symmetries of

the eective lagrangian. in general it is expected that these symmetries are not pre-

served by full-edged string theory, since the properties of states in the massive tower

depend non-trivially on the moduli. however, quite often a discrete version of these

symmetries is valid for the complete string theory, including the massive stringy modes

(or even non-perturbative states). the study of -model symmetries thus may provide

interesting insights into deeper properties of string theory.

a simple example is provided by d = 4 n = 1 heterotic orbifold vacua. the

classical low-energy lagrangian is invariant under a number of sl(2, r) transformations

acting on the untwisted moduli ti controlling the sizes of the compact dimensions. the
masses of momentum and winding modes depend on these moduli, so the continuous

symmetry is violated in the full string theory. however, the corresponding discrete

sl(2, z) modular transformations correspond to an exact symmetry of the full theory,

t-duality.

a new ingredient comes about when one realizes that the -model symmetries

involve a non-trivial transformation of chiral fermions charged under gauge symmetries.

this leads to potential -gauge (and -gravity) mixed anomalies, spoiling the quantum

validity of the symmetry. in fact, direct computation shows that the triangle diagram

contributions give a non-vanishing anomaly. even though this is not of great concern for

the continuous version of the symmetry, which is anyway broken by other eects, such

anomalies would be clearly inconsistent with t-duality being an exact symmetry of the

theory. happily, the triangle contribution is cancelled by additional eects. first, the

gauge kinetic functions have a non-trivial one-loop dependence (threshold correction

[1, 2]) on the untwisted moduli associated to complex planes left unrotated by some

orbifold group element. second, a green-schwarz mechanism [3] with dilaton exchange

cancels the remaining anomaly [4, 5]. notice that for complex planes rotated by all

orbifold group elements, there is no threshold correction [2], so the gs counterterms

cancel the anomalies not only for the discrete but also for the continuous version of the

-model symmetry.

it is natural to consider similar questions for other d = 4 n = 1 vacua. in the

present paper we center on type iib orientifolds [6] -[15] . the low-energy eective

lagrangians for moduli are quite analogous to those of heterotic models, for instance

they have sl(2, r) -model symmetries for the untwisted moduli ti. an important

1

dierence, however, is that in these type of vacua t-duality is not related to these

modular transformations. in fact, t-duality relates d-branes of dierent kinds, and so

does not act within a given class of models, but maps one class of vacua to another.
for instance, an orientifold with d9 branes and at a value ti for the ith complex plane
modulus is equivalent to another kind of orientifold, with d7-branes and at a value
1/ti of the ith complex plane modulus.

since the low-energy -model symmetries are seemingly not related to exact sym-

metries of the full-string theory, it is not obvious to what extent these symmetries

should be respected at the quantum level. in the present paper, however, we will argue

that the triangle anomalies for these symmetries may cancel by a gs mechanism in

certain specic cases.

this is suggested by the proposed duality [16] between type iib orientifold vacua

and heterotic compactications [7, 8, 12]. for many of the models we will study,

suitable heterotic orbifold duals have been identied. since -model anomalies cancel

in these heterotic models, it is reasonable to expect the corresponding anomalies to

cancel also in the orientifold version. this does not imply, though, that the anomaly

cancellation pattern is identical. in fact, the detailed analysis of the triangle anomaly

we will perform shows that the anomaly indeed factorizes, but the gs mechanism

required for the cancellation must involve not the dilaton, but closed string modes in

twisted sectors (the dilaton plays a role only in the cancellation of -gravity mixed

anomalies).

finally, let us remark that we will center on the study of modular transformations

associated to complex planes rotated by all elements in the orbifold group. only for

such planes we expect the gs mechanism to cancel the complete anomaly. for complex

planes left unrotated by some element of the orbifold group, both the argument invoking

duality with heterotic models, and the existence of threshold eects in d = 4 n = 2

type iib orientifold [17] suggest the anomaly cancellation may have additional sources

beyond the gs mechanism.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we briey review -model symmetries

in heterotic orbifold vacua. we introduce the basic notation and discuss the formulae

relevant to the cancellation of anomalies in these models.

in section 3 we address the same problem in type iib orientifold vacua. we start

with a brief review of cancellation of anomalous gauge u(1) symmetries, and the gener-

ation of fayet-iliopoulos terms, in section 3.1. in section 3.2 we derive general formulae

for the triangle contributions to -model anomalies in type iib orientifolds, and com-

pute them explicitly for a set of models. the analysis of the factorization properties

2

of these anomalies is performed in sections 3.3 and 3.4, where we also discuss how a

gs mechanism involving non-trivial shifts of the rr twisted sector axions may can-

cel the anomaly. models with wilson lines and/or non coincident branes are studied

in section 3.5. finally, in section 3.6 we study -gravitational mixed anomalies and

show they can be cancelled through exchange of both the twisted rr axions and the

universal axion (partner of the dilaton).

in section 4 we comment on the mixing between the untwisted and twisted moduli

required for the gs mechanism to work. an interesting consequence is the existence

of an additional ti-dependent contribution to the fi terms for the anomalous u(1)s.
finally, section 5 contains our conclusions.

orbifolds

the kahler potential dependence on the complex dilaton s and the untwisted kahler

moduli ti, i = 1, 2, 3 in this class of heterotic orbifolds is well known. these elds live
in a coset -model with symmetry given by 1

may be written to rst order in this elds as:

the conformal eld theory sector corresponding to the eld. for the untwisted matter
elds associated to the jth complex plane one nds:

j = i

(2.4)

1for particular orbifold models like the z3 or z6 there is an enlarged number of untwisted kahler

moduli and in some others like z4 or z6 there may be complex structure scalars. we will concentrate

for simplicity on the three kahler moduli ti which are always present for any orbifold where the

six-torus lattice can be decomposed as three two-dimensional lattices.

eects. however, in the heterotic case we know that the discrete subgroup sl(2, z)3

this continuous symmetry is in general expected to be violated by world-sheet
ti of
the above non-compact symmetry corresponds to the t-duality invariance of heterotic

vacua. thus this discrete subgroup has to remain as a symmetry even after world-sheet

corrections are included.

in particular, the transformations (2.6), (2.7) induce chiral rotations in the massless

fermions of the theory. they are associated to gauge transformations of a composite

gauge vector potential involving the moduli elds ti. if we compute the triangle anoma-
lies corresponding to this composite current and two gauge currents one nds in general

an anomalous result. the coecient of this anomaly can be computed to be given by

[2, 4, 5] :

bi
a = c(ga) +xra

t (ra)(1 + 2ni
ra

)

(2.8)

here c(ga) is the quadratic casimir of the gauge group ga in the adjoint representation
and t (ra) is the quadratic casimir in the representation ra corresponding to a charged
eld. the sum extends over all elds charged under ga and ni
is the modular weight
along the complex plane i of each given eld. in general this mixed -g2
a anomalies do

not cancel. the gauge kinetic terms get one-loop (non-local) corrections [4, 5] :

where w a are the eld strength of gauge elds. under sl(2, r)ti transformations
this action is not invariant due to the non-local piece. however we know that discrete

t -duality transformations have to be a good symmetry also at the quantum level. the

cancellation of the triangle anomaly comes about from two additional contributions:

1) under the -model continuous transformations in (2.6) the complex dilaton s

gets also transformed as [4, 5, 18] 3:

s  s + ka

3

xi=1

i
gs log(iciti + di).

(2.10)

here i

gs is a gauge group-independent coecient which describes the one-loop mixing
between the s and the ti elds in these heterotic vacua, and ka is the kac-moody
level of the gauge group. since s is the tree-level gauge function coecient for all
gauge groups, this transformation gives an additional contribution to the mixed -g2
a
anomalies. in particular this transformation cancels all  model anomalies in zn , n
odd orbifolds with no twist leaving one complex plane unrotated (z3 and z7 standard
heterotic orbifolds). this is also the mechanism which cancels anomalies corresponding

to complex planes i which are always rotated by the twists of the model. thus, for

example, that is the case of the anomalies with respect to the rst two planes in the

z6 orbifold generated by the twist v = 1/6(1, 1, 2). notice that this green-schwarz
mechanism not only cancels discrete t -duality symmetry anomalies but continuous

-model anomalies. also notice that this mechanism is gauge group independent and

hence the mixed anomalies should be equal for all gauge groups if they are to be

cancelled only by this mechanism.

2) for heterotic orbifolds containing some complex plane i left unrotated by some

orbifold twist there is a ti-dependent one-loop threshold correction to the gauge ki-
netic functions. this threshold correction is in general gauge-group dependent and

was computed in ref.

[2]. for complex planes of these type, the discrete t -duality

anomalies in (2.8) are cancelled by the transformation properties of these threshold

corrections plus the green-schwarz mechanism above. notice however thus, unlike the

previous mechanism, the threshold correction explicitly violate the continuous  model

symmetries and respect only the discrete subgroups associated to t -dualities.

notice that in order for the s-dependent kahler potential to be invariant under the

transformation in (2.10) it has to be modied to:

k(s, s) =  log(s + s + kaxi

i
gs log(ti + t 

i ))

(2.11)

3we dene here res = 82/g2.

5

reecting explicitly the one-loop mixing between s and ti elds.

in addition to mixed -gauge anomalies there will be mixed -gravity anomalies.

the corresponding triangle graph involving massless fermions gives an anomaly pro-

portional to [18] :

bi
grav = 21 + 1 + i

m  dim g + x

(1 + 2ni

)

(2.12)

here 21 comes from the gravitino contribution, 1 comes from the dilatino and i

m rep-
resents the contribution from untwisted moduli. the other two terms come from the

contribution of gauginos and charged chiral matter respectively. the same two mecha-

nisms which we described above are also present in the cancellation of the corresponding

duality anomalies.

four-dimensional heterotic vacua do also often have one anomalous gauged u(1)

symmetry in their eective lagrangian. those anomalies are cancelled by a green-

schwarz mechanism [3], very much like the -model anomalies discussed above.

in

this case under a gauge u(1) transformation with gauge parameter (x), the dilaton

transforms like:

s  s + kax

gs (x) .

(2.13)

and this cancels all mixed anomalies. notice that in an heterotic model with both an

anomalous u(1) and -model anomalies the s-dependent piece will thus take the form:

k(s, s) =  log(s + s + kaxi

i
gs log(ti + t 

i )  kax

(2.14)

where vx is the vector supereld of the anomalous u(1). as is well known [19], there
is also a fayet-iliopoulos (fi) term associated to the anomalous u(1) :

iib orientifolds

let us recall the structure of d = 4 n = 1 [6] -[15] type iib orientifolds [20, 21, 22, 23].

the models we will be centering on are constructed by modding out the toroidally

torus together with the world-sheet parity operation  [20, 21, 22, 23] . we will

consider orientifold groups with the structure g1 +g1 and center on g1 = zn orbifold
moddings. all possible twists consistent with spacetime n = 1 supersymmetry have

been classied in [24], and their eigenvalues v = (v1, v2, v3) are shown in table 1.

the closed string sector is constructed by performing the orientifold projection

to the spectrum of type iib theory on the corresponding toroidal orbifold.

in the

untwisted sector, one obtains the d = 4 n = 1 supergravity multiplet, one chiral

multiplet s containing the dilaton, and a further set of moduli describing the geometry

of the original torus. as in the heterotic case mentioned above, the number of such

moduli is model-dependent, and we will center on the three moduli ti, i = 1, 2, 3
corresponding to the three complex planes. the closed string twisted modes will also

be relevant to our purposes. a xed point f will have associated chiral singlet elds
m k

f for each k-twisted sector.
the consistency of the equations of motion for the rr potentials requires the can-

cellation of the corresponding tadpoles. this is implemented by introducing d branes

whose rr charge cancels that of the orientifold planes. for zn , with n odd, only
d9-branes are required. they ll the full space-time and six dimensional compact
space. for n even, d5k-branes, with world-volume lling space-time and the kth com-
plex plane, may be required. this is so whenever the orientifold group contains the
element rirj, for k 6= i, j. here ri (rj) is an order two twist of the ith (jth) complex
plane. in what follows we consider cases with only one set of vebranes, which, with

the conventions for the twists in table 1, wrap the third complex plane.

the action of an orientifold group element g on dp-branes is specied by a unitary
matrix, g,p. it turns out to be useful to introduce the vectors v p given in terms of the
eigenvalues 5 e2iva of the matrices ,p, corresponding to the generators of the orbifold
group. let us also dene wp
i appears.
5in order for the orientifold projection to be a symmetry, the eigenvalues come in complex conjugate

i to be the number of times a given eigenvalue v p

pairs. thus we dene v p to contain only the phases in [0, ).

7

for a given orientifold group one can obtain a set of constraints on the chan-

paton matrices for these d branes. some of them follow from the requirement that

the matrices form a representation of the orientifold group, while others correspond to

cancellation of twisted tadpoles (see e.g.
[12] for details). the chan-paton matrices
determine the (open-string) spectrum of the model. for instance, the integers wp
i
introduced above specify the ranks of the ith factor in the gauge group on the dp-

branes.

instead of entering the details of their construction, table 2 conveniently

provides a list of the models we will consider, along with their spectra. the mentioned

constraints ensure the consistency of the resulting models. in particular, they imply the

cancellation of gauge and gravitational anomalies (see [25] for a detailed discussion). it
is known that out of the list of twists in table 1, the examples based on z4, z8, z 
8 and
z 
12 have twisted tadpoles and hence are inconsistent [9, 12], at least with the standard
gp-projection [23] here discussed. we will thus focus in the remaining examples when

we treat specic models.

3.1 cancellation of u (1) gauge anomalies and fi terms

befores studying -model anomalies in type iib orientifolds, we recall the structure

and cancellation of gauge u(1) anomalies in these models. this will be useful because

there is a close analogy between the gs anomaly cancellation mechanisms in both

cases. also, the mixing between untwisted and twisted moduli required to cancel -

model anomalies implies a interesting contribution to the fi terms for the anomalous

u(1)s. thus this section also provides the notation and formulae relevant to this issue.

the cancellation of u(1) anomalies in d = 4 n = 1 type iib orientifolds is quite

interesting. in contrast with heterotic models, these theories have generically several

u(1)s with non-vanishing triangle anomalies. moreover, the mixed anomalies with

dierent non-abelian gauge factors and gravity are not in adequate ratios to be cancelled

by a gs mechanism with exchange of the partner of the dilaton [12]. however, in [15]

it was proposed that a dierent version of the gs mechanism, with exchange of rr
twisted closed string modes, cancels these anomalies 6.

let us consider for instance the mixed non-abelian anomaly. the anomaly in the

eld theory is reproduced by the string theory diagrams depicted in figure 1, in the

point-particle limit in the open-string channel. as mentioned above, the net contribu-

tion is non-vanishing, which would mean an inconsistency of the theory at the quantum

level. however, the same string diagrams in figure 1 give additional low-energy con-

close-string channel contributions corresponding to diagrams 1a and 1b cancel against

each other, due to cancellation of disk and crosscap pieces at the end of the innite

tube (this is the statement of tadpole cancellation). on the other hand, the diagram

1c gives a non-vanishing closed-string channel contribution, schematically depicted in

figure 2. it is interpreted as the exchange of twisted rr elds, which propagate on

the innitely elongated cylinder. this contribution was determined in[15] to be

tion can be induced from the mere structure of the triangle anomalies. indeed, a simple

usual triangle anomaly. the third is a point-particle limit in the closed string channel and

represents the exchange of closed string twisted modes. notice that the cylinder diagram in

gure 3 generates two dierent eld-theory contributions.

strategy used in [15], and to be exploited below, is to write down the triangle anomaly

for a generic orientifold in terms of the integers wi, which dene the chan-paton matri-
ces and determine the eld theory spectrum. then one can perform a discrete fourier

transform to express the anomaly in terms of the chan-paton traces tr k. at this
point, the anomaly exhibits a factorized form with the structure (3.1). since consis-

tency of string theory implies the total contribution from the triangle anomalies plus

the gs terms must vanish, this technique allows to easily obtain the structure of the

gs terms.

we would like to stress that this trick is in the spirit of the study of many other

anomalies in string theory, where a preliminary low-energy analysis of the anomaly

reveals the factorized structure, and suggests the corresponding gs counterterms. a

further step, usually much more involved, is the explicit string theory computation of

the required couplings.

10

the same mechanism can be employed to cancel mixed gravitational anomalies.

notice that in this case the graviton is a closed string mode, and so the relevant

string diagrammatics is dierent. in particular, as shown in fig 3, only two diagrams

contribute and factorization is not as obvious as in the preceding case. factorization

is, however, strongly suggested by the structure of the triangle anomalies. this is

done as sketched above: one writes the mixed gravitational anomalies for a general

orientifold, and performs a discrete fourier transform to rewrite them in terms of the

chan-paton matrices. the triangle anomaly is given by a factorized expression, which

can be cancelled by a gs term of the form

(3.3)

in string theory factorization follows from the fact that the cylinder diagram provides

two low-energy contributions, corresponding to the point-particle limit in the open

and closed string channels (g 4). again, figures 4a and 4b give the usual eld theory

triangle anomaly, whereas figure 4c provides the gs contribution, which can be inter-

preted as exchange of twisted rr elds. this type of factorization will be relevant for

the cancellation of  model anomalies that we will study below.

before doing that, let us point out some consequences of the coupling of twisted

closed string modes to gauge elds for the eective low energy eld theory lagrangian.

we will restrict ourselves in this discussion to zn orientifolds with n odd (z3 and z7
in the compact case) since the structure of their twisted closed string elds is much

simpler. the even n case is discussed in the appendix. first, for this generalized

green-schwarz mechanism to work there must be a modication of the gauge kinetic

function. in particular one has for the gauge group gb:

here the sum on f goes over the number of xed points = c 2

f is a closed string chiral singlet eld living on the xed point f and
corresponding to the twist k. notice that, since the d9-brane world-volume spans the

complete compact space, the gauge elds couple to twisted elds from all xed points.

string chiral elds m k

notice how in this way the net eect of this shift combined with eq.(3.4) is the contri-

bution (3.1) discussed above.

a general property of this contributions to the fi-term is that it is controlled by
f , and can be adjusted at will. in particular, this contribution
vanishes at the orbifold point. the above result concerning fi-terms will be revised in

section 4 in the light of our analysis of -model anomalies, since it implies substantial

changes in several respects.

3.2

-model anomalies

let us turn to the study of -model anomalies in d = 4 n = 1 compact orientifolds. as

mentioned in the introduction, heterotic/type i duality suggests that these anomalies

should also cancel at least in some classes of type iib orientifold. more precisely, there

are a number of d = 4, n = 1 orientifolds for which specic candidate heterotic duals

have been identied (see e.g. [12] for a general discussion). that is the case for example

of the z3 [7, 8] and z7 [30] orientifolds. now, we already mentioned in the previous
chapter that -model anomalies in the heterotic side are only cancelled for complex

planes which are rotated by all twists in the orbifold group. thus, properly speaking,

we should expect cancellation of -model anomalies in the type iib orientifold case

only for this type of complex direction. thus, they should cancel for any complex

plane in zn orientifolds with n odd, and also along some complex planes of other type

7the same qualitative conclusion follows for more general kahler potentials, as long as they are

non-singular at the orientifold point [29]. we would like to thank e. poppitz for comments on this

point.

of orientifolds, like e.g., the rst two complex planes of the z6 and z12 orientifolds or
the rst complex plane in the z 
6 orientifold. we will concentrate our study to those
complex planes in which the candidate heterotic duals present cancellation of -model

anomalies.

it is easy to compute directly the triangle anomalies in several models, and check

that they do not cancel. let us consider the simplest type iib d = 4, n = 1

orientifolds z3, z7, z6, z6 and z12 whose spectra are given in table 2 for a conguration
with all 5-branes sitting at the origin (see ref.[12] for details). in order to compute the

anomalies we need to know the modular weights ni of each eld with respect to
sl(2, r)ti transformations. in other words, we need to know the ti dependence of
the kinetic terms of each eld in the orientifold. for this class of orientifolds this was

discussed in ref.[12] and [31]. for models with only 9-branes the relevant piece of the

kahler potential is analogous to that of the untwisted sector of the heterotic orbifolds,

namely

k(s, s, ti, t 

i ) =  log(s + s)

(3.9)

where c 9

i are the charged elds from the (99) sector of the orbifold corresponding to

13

the ith complex plane. thus the modular weights of the c 9
jth complex plane is nj
table 2, the corresponding kahler potential is given by:

i eld with respect to the

(3.10)

here the world-volume of 5-branes includes the third complex plane. also, c 95 are the

charged elds in the (95) sector of the orientifold. the s and ti dependence of the
gauge kinetic functions is given by f9 = s and f5 = t3. notice that, since the gauge
kinetic function for the 5-brane gauge group is t3, the (55) gauge group explicitly
breaks the sl(2, r) symmetry associated to t3 and hence cancellation of -model
anomalies in the third complex plane are not in principle expected.

from the above formula one sees that the modular weights along the jth plane

(j = 1, 2) are given by:

(3.16)

in principle one expects cancellation of -model anomalies with respect to the three

complex planes for z3, z7, with respect to the rst two complex planes for z6 and z12
and only with respect to the rst one for z6. notice that the mixed anomalies with
dierent gauge factors are not in appropriate ratios to be cancelled by a gs mechanism

with exchange of the partner of the dilaton as in heterotic vacua.

this is hardly surprising, since we are already familiar with the fact that type iib

orientifolds gs interactions are typically mediated by exchange or rr elds in the

closed string twisted sector.

in the following we will argue that these interactions

provide a mechanism to cancel -model anomalies.

in the particular case of mixed non-abelian anomalies, the relevant string diagrams,

shown in gure 5 are analogous to those appearing in the study of gravitational- gauge

u(1) mixed anomalies, reviewed above. in particular, only two topologies contribute

to the string theory amplitude. this is so because the composite gauge connections

associated to the -model symmetries are constructed out of closed string moduli.

thus, we expect a factorization pattern (see see g 6) analogous to that found in

gravitational- gauge u(1) anomalies.

further support can be obtained through a detailed study of the triangle anomalies.

as explained above, a simple technique to detect factorization is to write the general

triangle anomaly and then perform a fourier transform as we show in the next section.

an important nal point we would like to remark is the relationship between the -

model anomalies and the conformal anomaly in this type of orientifolds. if we consider

the diagonal sl(2, r)t transformation corresponding to the identication t1 = t2 =
t3 = t , the corresponding anomaly coecient is given by:

bt
a =

3

xi=1



bi
a

= a

(3.17)

i.e., it equals the one-loop a function. this happens because (unlike the heterotic
case) all charged elds have overall modular weights nt = 1. thus for all con-

formal theories (like, e.g. subsectors of the theory corresponding to branes away from

orientifold planes) the overall anomalies cancel identically.

16

3.3 green-schwarz cancellation of -model anomalies: odd n ,

zn orientifolds

the only odd order zn twists which act cristalographically in six compact dimensions
are z3 and z7, but we will write general expressions for zn with n = 2p + 1 with
arbitrary p . the gauge group in this class of orientifolds is given by

so(w0) 

u(wj)

p

yj=1

(3.18)

and the charged chiral elds from the (99) sector are given by:

3

xi=1

(

2p

xa=0

1
2

(wa, wa+li ) + a nli

+ a li

)

2

2

(3.19)

where vi = li/n, and w, a denote the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric rep-
resentations. the sum over a goes only over 2a 6= li, mod n and a negative subindex for
a representation implies conjugation. for fractional subindices the corresponding anti-

symmetric representations are absent. starting from this spectrum and using eq.(2.8)
one obtains the following -g2

a anomalies with respect to the ith complex plane:

bi 

a = wa + 2a,0 

1
2

(wa+li + wali) + 2a+li + 2ali

1

+

2 xj6=i

(wa+lj + walj ) xj6=i

(2a+lj + 2alj )

(3.20)

(3.21)

now we want to re-express this in terms of the chan-paton twist matrices. the general

action of the twists k = 1, . . . , n on the 9-branes is given by the matrix:

k = diag (iw0, kiw1,    , j

kiwj ,    , n 1

k

iwn 1)

(3.22)

with k = e2ik/n . notice that the orientifold symmetry requires wa = wn a. the
trace of this matrix is given by

tr k =

2ik

n wa

e

n

xa=1

(3.23)

now we can perform an inverse fourier transform to re-express the wa in terms of the
traces of ks. plugging it back in eq.(3.21) one obtains, after some simple algebra, the
result:

bi 

a =

1
n

n 1

xk=1

k cos(4k va)
i

(3.24)

with

i

k =

1
2

c2k(v)cotg (2kvi)tr 2k  ck(v)cotg (kvi)

(3.25)

17

where ck was dened in eq.(3.2). notice that this expression has the structure expected
from the diagrams in fig.5. indeed, the factor cos(4kva) = tr (2k2
a) comes from the
insertion of two gauge bosons in the outer boundaries of gures 5a and 5b. then the

cylinder graph should give rise to the tr 2k factor in eq.(3.25) whereas the other term
corresponds to the moebius strip graph 5a. it is nice to recover the expected structure

starting merely from the massless spectrum. twisted tadpole constraints in odd n

orientifolds further require [7, 8, 9, 12] :

tr 2k = 32

cos(kvi)

3

yi=1

and plugging this back into eq.(3.25) one nally gets the simple result:

i

k = ck(v) tg (kvi)

(3.26)

(3.27)

where we have made use of the fact that c2k = ckqi 2 cos(kvi). thus altogether the

mixed -gauge anomalies for odd order orientifolds can be written as:

bi 

a =

2
n

(n 1)/2

xk=1

ck(v) tg(kvi) cos 4kva

(3.28)

a comparison with the equivalent result for mixed gauged u(1) anomalies in eq.(3.1)

shows how analogous these expressions are. this is highly suggestive that indeed,

as it happened in the u(1) case, -model anomalies are cancelled by a green-schwarz

mechanism in which twisted rr elds are exchanged in the closed string channel. from

the eld theory point of view, the mechanism works in analogy with the discussion

following eqs (3.4) and (3.5). in the present case the twisted elds corresponding to

the xed point f would transform with respect to a -model transformation along the
ith complex plane like:

imm k

f  imm k

f + 2tg(kvi) log(iciti + di)

(3.29)

which combined with (3.4) would exactly cancel the anomaly (recall c 2

k gives the

number of xed points in these compact orbifols).

let us nally comment that using eqs.(3.17) and (3.28) one can write a simple

expression for the -functions of the gauge groups in these models:

a = 

2
n

(n 1)/2

xk=1

c 2
k

i=1 2 cos(kvi)

q3

where f label the xed points.

cos(4kva) = 

2

n xf xk

1

i=1 2 cos(kvi)

q3

cos(4kva)

(3.30)

18

for the compact z3 and z7 orientifolds under consideration, if one sets all m k

f = m

the gauge kinetic function (3.4) may be written in the simple form

fb = s 

a
2

m

(3.31)

for z3 and z7 respectively. under an sl(2, r)t transformation one has imm 
imm  2 log(ict + d), for z7 and z3 respectively and this cancels the overall modulus
anomaly. indeed the variation cancels the contribution from the second term in (2.9).

this is an interesting expression since the disk coupling of the twisted eld m looks like

a one-loop factor, in the sense that it is proportional to the -function. this fact had

already been observed in ref.[31], where it was used to achieve precocious unication

of gauge couplings constants.

3.4 green-schwarz cancellation of -model anomalies: even

n , zn orientifolds

here we will discuss the particular case of even order zn orientifolds with only one
sector of 5-branes, with world-volume in the third complex direction. as we mentioned

above, in this case sl(2, r)t3 is explicitly broken at the classical level by the gauge
kinetic terms of the 5-brane gauge group so we will not discuss anomaly cancellations

along the third complex plane. in addition, if the complex plane is left unrotated in

some twisted sector, we know that in the heterotic dual anomalies are not cancelled

only by a gs mechanism. thus we will discus anomaly cancellation only along complex

planes which are rotated by all twists in the model.

we will consider the case of the standard gimon-polchinski projection [23] leading
to a embedding without vector structure in the gauge degrees of freedom. the
prototype models we have in mind here are the z6 and z6 orientifolds mentioned above.
let us consider arbitrary zn (n = 2p ) twists with eigenvalues given by 1
n (l1, l2, l3),
with l1 + l2 + l3 = 0 and l3 an even integer (thus l1, l2 are odd). as we said, we
concentrate on models without vector structure. the general chan-paton matrix for
d9-branes has the form

iwj ,    , (2p 1)

iwp , (2p 1)

iwp ,    , (2j1)

k

k

k,9 = diag (kiw1,    , (2j1)

k iw1)
(3.32)
with k = eik/n . here we have already imposed the orientifold symmetry wj =
wn j+1. the matrices for d5-branes are analogous with the replacement of wj by uj
as the number of eigenvalues (2j1)

. these matrices correspond to the shifts

iwj ,    , 1

with wj (uj) entries (2j  1) for d9- and d5-branes, respectively, and j = 1,    , p .

the associated gauge group is

u(wj)

yj=1

u(uj)

yj=1

(3.34)

the complete massless spectrum for this class of models can be found in ref.[25]. using

that spectrum and the modular weights given in eq.(3.11), one nds the following result

for the mixed anomalies with the non-abelian gauge symmetries from the 9-brane

sector:

bi 

a = wa 

1
2

(wa+li + wali) + 2a+li+1 + 2ali+1

(3.35)

+

2 xj6=i

(wa+lj + walj ) xj6=i

(2a+lj 1 + 2alj 1)

the trace of the twist matrices are given by

tr k,9 =

i(2a1)k

n wa

e

n

xa=1

(3.36)

(and analogously for 5-branes). again, we perform an inverse discrete fourier transform

to express the wa in terms of the chan-paton traces and substitute them in (3.36).
the result is

k cos(4k va)
i

(3.37)

bi

a =

where

n 1

k = (xj6=i

cos(4kvj)  cos(4kvi)  1) tr 2k,9

cos(2kvj)  cos(2kvi)) + i

3 cos(2kv3) tr 2k,5

(3.38)

after some trigonometry and rearrangement of terms one can rewrite this formula as:

i

k =

1
2

c2k(v) cotg (2kvi)tr 2k9 2 ck(v) cotg (kvi) + i

3 cos(2kv3) tr 2k,5 (3.39)

where the sum in eq.(3.37) is now extended only from k = 1 to k = n  1. now, if we

restrict to the case of complex planes i which are rotated by all twists in the model,

the last term drops, leaving

i

k =

1
2

c2k cotg (2kvi) tr 2k,9  2 ck cotg (kvi)

(3.40)

to proceed further we need to impose the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions for

tr 2k,9, which are model dependent. for the z6 and z6 orientifolds we have the

20

condition 8:

tr 2k,9 = (1)k 32

after substitution one nally gets:

cos(kvi)

3

yi=1

(3.41)

i
k = 2 [ (1)k c4k cotg (2kvi)  ck cotg (kvi) ]

(3.42)

the results for z6 and z6 for the dierent twists k are shown in table 3.

for the z12 orientifold with all the d5-branes at the origin we have the following

twisted tadpole cancellation conditions [12, 25] :

tr k,9 = tr k,5 = 0 ;

k = 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11

(3.43)

tr 4,9 = tr 4,5 = 4

tr 8,9 = tr 8,5 = 4

(3.44)

plugging these traces back into eq.(3.40), one nally gets the i

k. for the k=odd

contribution the rst term in eq.(3.40) vanishes, leaving only:

i

k = 2ck cotg (kvi) , i = 1, 2 , k = odd

(3.45)

for the k=even sectors the contribution of tr 2k is non-vanishing, the additional
contribution for these sectors is of the form:

 2c2k cotg (2kvi) , i = 1, 2 , k = even

(3.46)

the sum of the two terms gives the i

k shown in table 3.

as we see, the structure we obtain for the  model anomalies along complex planes

which are always rotated by the twists is very analogous to that we found for odd

orientifolds. the result in both cases shows the anomaly can be cancelled by a gs

mechanism mediated by the exchange of twisted rr elds. comparing these results

with those obtained for gauged anomalous u(1)s, one observes that the role of the

sin(2kva) factors in u(1) anomaly cancellation is here played by the tg and cotg factors
displayed in table 3. just like sin(2kva) measures the mixing of the anomalous u(1)s
with twisted moduli, in the present case those trigonometric factors should measure

the mixing of untwisted moduli ti with twisted moduli.
conrm these couplings by a direct computation in string theory.

it would be interesting to

8the dierence in sign compared to eq.(3.26) is due to the fact that here n

1,9 = 1 since the

embedding has no vector structure.

3.5 models with wilson lines/non coincident branes

let us briey comment on how the same anomaly cancellation mechanism works in

models with wilson lines or with branes sitting at dierent points in the compact

space (both possibilities are related by t-duality). to keep the discussion simple,

we present two concrete examples with the z3 orientifold as starting point. in order
to make the construction more intuitive, we will perform a t-duality along the six

compact dimensions, thereby transforming the wilson lines on the d9-branes into

positions of the t-dual d3 branes. the resulting models have orientifold group z3 +
z3r1r2r3(1)fl and contain 32 d3-branes and no d7-branes.

i) an example with a conformal subsector
the rst model we consider is analogous to that studied in [11] 9. it is obtained upon

placing 20 d3-branes at the origin, which is a z3 orientifold point, and the remaining 12
d3-branes, in two groups of six, at two of the other z3 xed points (these are orbifold
rather than orientifold points), related by the orientifold projection. the spectrum is

so(4)  u(8)  u(2)1  u(2)2  u(2)3

3[(4, 8; 1, 1, 1) + (1, 28; 1, 1, 1) + (1, 1; 2, 2, 1) + (1, 1; 1, 2, 2) + (1, 1; 2, 1, 2)] (3.47)

notice that the model with all branes at the origin is continuously connected to

this theory, by moving 12 d3 branes o the origin to the z3 orbifold points. thus,
9even though the anomaly cancellation works analogously for the model in [11], the theory we

consider is slightly more illustrative for this particular issue.

22

it is expected the pattern of anomaly cancellation will be similar in both models. in

checking that this is so we will learn an interesting bit or information concerning the

behaviour of twisted modes of orbifold (rather than orientifold) singularities in the

anomaly cancellation.

it is easy to check that the mixed -gauge anomalies with respect to the dierent

factors are

su (2)a = 0, i = 1, 2, 3

(3.48)

we see that the structure of -model anomalies reveals the existence of two well-

dened sectors. the modular anomalies related to gauge groups for d3-branes at the

origin (so(4) and su(8)) are exactly the same as in the model with all branes at the

origin. on the other hand, the triangle mixed anomalies with respect to the su(2)

groups on the d3-branes at the orbifold singularity vanish automatically, as expected

since this sector is conformal (see section 3.2).

it is straightforward to check that the anomalies for d3-branes at the origin cancel

through the gs mechanism exactly as in the model with coincident branes. for the

d3 branes at the orbifold singularity triangle anomalies vanish, and no gs mechanism

is required. we thus learn that closed string twisted modes of orbifold (rather than

orientifold) singularities do not generate gs counterterms.

ii) a further example

the second example we would like to consider has appeared in [14]. in this model

23 d3-branes sit at the origin, and the remaining 9 d3-branes are stuck at dierent
points xed under r1r2r3(1)fl, i.e. o3-planes. notice that this theory is not
continuously connected to the model with all branes at the origin, and so anomaly

cancellation is not obvious a priori.

the spectrum of the model is

so(5)  u(9)

3 [ (5, 9) + (1, 36) ]

explicit computation of the triangle anomalies reveals that

bi 

so(5) = 6, bi 

su (9) = 3

(3.49)

(3.50)

the anomaly is exactly cancelled by the gs mechanism, as discussed above.

notice the d3-branes stuck at the o3-planes do not contribute any gauge factors

or matter multiplets, but this fact is not essential for the gs mechanism to work.

23

actually, it is easy to construct related models with several d3-branes at each o3-plane

(at the expense of reducing the number of d3-branes at the origin), so that the model

contains additional subsectors. the triangle anomalies with respect to these gauge

factors vanishes automatically, so no gs contribution is required. this is expected

since the o3-plane is not a xed point with respect to the z3 orbifold group and thus
does not contain the appropriate twisted elds. the triangle anomaly associated to d3-

branes at the origin is exactly as above and cancels through the usual gs mechanism.

we would like to stress that, even though we have discussed only two simple exam-

ples, the mechanism for the cancellation of anomalies remains valid for more compli-

cated models.

3.6 mixed -model-gravitational anomalies

the -model symmetries we have studied in the preceding sections have mixed anoma-

lies not only with the non-abelian gauge factors, but also with gravity. in this section

we address the cancellation of these gravitational anomalies. for simplicity, we will

restrict ourselves to the case of odd order compact orientifolds, but the analysis holds

in general with suitable modications of the relevant couplings.

the main dierence between these anomalies and those studied above is that the

triangle anomalies also contain the contribution of massless closed string states, running

in the loop. thus we will split the triangle anomaly in two pieces:

bi
grav = bi

closed + bi

open

the rst contribution bi

closed has the form:

bi
closed = 21 + 1 + i

t + i
m

(3.51)

(3.52)

as we discussed in the heterotic case, the 21 + 1 come from the gravitino and dilatino
(partner of s) elds. the third term i
t represent the contribution of the untwisted
t = 3, 1 for z3 and z7 re-
m represent the contribution of the twisted closed string
states. those have only non-linear transformations with respect to the sl(2, r) trans-

moduli elds themselves.
spectively. the fourth term i

it is easy to check that i

formations, and so have zero modular weights. their contribution is equal to the

number of twisted chiral elds.

this bi

closed piece of the anomaly is analogous to the one appearing in the heterotic
models, which also involves closed strings. as we mentioned in section 2, in the het-

erotic case the contribution from the eld theory triangle diagrams is cancelled exactly

by a one-loop diagram which mixes the s and ti elds.

world-sheets contributing to the mixed -gravitational anomalies. the cut in the handles

of diagrams b) and d) represent a gluing that reverses the orientation. diagrams a) and b)

represent closed string massless elds running though a loop, and reproduce the eld theory

triangle anomaly. diagrams c) and d) represent the exchange of the dilaton multiplet along

the innite tube, and its one-loop coupling to the moduli ti. they provide the gs amplitudes
that cancel the triangle anomaly.

the fact that the closed string contribution to the anomaly in the type i case has

the same structure suggest that this piece is cancelled in a similar fashion. namely,
we propose that bi
closed is cancelled by a one-loop mixing between the dilaton multiplet
and the untwisted moduli ti. thus, unlike what happens with mixed u(1) or -model
anomalies for which the dilaton s plays no role in anomaly cancellation, in the case of

mixed -model-gravity anomalies the s eld gets transformed at one loop under an

sl(2, r) transformation.

the diagrammatic explanation for this behaviour is depicted in figure 7. the rst

two diagrams show the eld theory triangle anomaly due to type i closed string modes.

the diagrams c) and d) show the additional low-energy contributions corresponding

to these topologies. they are interpreted as the exchange of the dilaton multiplet

along the innite tube, and its coupling to the untwisted moduli through a one-loop

subdiagram.

notice that this non-trivial transformation of the dilaton leads to no contradiction

with our previous results concerning -model-gauge anomalies. this follows from the

dierent dilaton dependence of the f  f and r  r terms in type i string theory.

the contribution arising from the coupling sf  f coupling upon the one-loop trans-

formation of the s-eld is a term of higher order in perturbation theory, as compared
with the analogous coupling with gravity. 10. in summary, the triangle anomaly from

10this can be rephrased in string diagrammatics as follows. a string topology combining the one-

loop mixing of the s and ti elds and the coupling of s to the gauge bosons will include one handle

25

closed string states will be cancelled by the one-loop mixing of s and ti elds.

the remaining contribution, bi

open, is on the other hand cancelled through exchange
of twisted closed string modes in the already familiar fashion. the relevant diagrams

providing the eld theory triangle anomaly and the gs terms are analogous to those

involved in the discussion of mixed -gauge anomalies (see gures 5, 6), with the

dierence that the graviton vertex operator should be attached in the interior of the

world-sheet. to support the existence of this cancellation mechanism one can use

techniques similar to those used for mixed gauge anomalies. for the odd zn we are
considering, using eqs.(3.19) and (2.12) one gets

indeed, the result in eq.(3.57) suggests the two contributions from annulus and from

moebius strip. also it shows an structure which is compatible with its cancellation

by the exchange of twisted closed string massless states coupling simultaneously to

untwisted moduli ti and gravitons.

and one boundary. if g, b and c are the number of handles, boundaries and crosscaps, we will have a

dilaton dependence with a power (2  2g  b  c) = 1, whereas one-loop eects (like the diagrams in

fig. 5) have a vanishing power (g = 0, b = 2, c = 0, or g = 0, b = 1, c = 1).

26

4 fayet-iliopoulos terms and untwisted/twisted mod-

uli mixing

the presence and cancellation of -model anomalies have certain implications for the

structure of the eective low-energy action of type iib compact orientifolds. we al-

ready observed how in the case of heterotic orbifolds some mixing (eq.(2.11)) must

appear between the eld which transforms non-linearly under the sl(2, r)ti symme-
tries (i.e., s in the heterotic case) and the untwisted moduli ti. something analogous
must occur in the type iib orientifold case, but now it will be the twisted elds m k
f
which mix with the untwisted moduli. if, in addition there are also anomalous u(1)

symmetries, as is generically the case, the kahler potential of the twisted elds will be

of the form

) = k(m k

f + m k

xi=1

gs k log(ti + t 

i ))

(4.1)

in order to have both u(1)a gauge invariance and -model invariance with respect
to the ith complex direction. thus the above kahler potential would be invariant

respectively under the transformations (we consider here the case of odd n orientifolds

for simplicity):

(4.3)

for a quadratic kahler potential for the m k

corresponding to the u(1)a eld :

a = xf xk

(4.4)

this is an interesting result since it shows that in compact type iib orientifolds the

fayet-iliopoulos terms are controlled not only by the blowing up modes of the orbifold

singularities but also by the untwisted moduli ti. the fi-term in fact vanishes at the
points with:

2rem k

remains unbroken (fi-terms =0).

27

as we remarked in the previous section, the cancellation of mixed -gravitational

anomalies requires also the presence of a mixing between the complex dilaton s and

the untwisted moduli, very much analogous to the heterotic case. thus one expects a

form for this mixing (again in the case of odd orientifolds):

k(s, s) =  log(s + s +xi

i
closed log(ti + t 

i ))

(4.6)

the additional untwisted moduli-dependence of fi-terms in compact type iib ,

d = 4, n = 1 orientifolds have interesting implications which will be discussed in

more detail elsewhere [32]. notice, for example, that it changes previous discussions

about matching of z3 and z7 orientifolds with their corresponding heterotic duals [29]
(for example, for generic compact radii both the orientifold model and the heterotic

dual will have non-vanishing fi-terms associated to their anomalous u(1)s), or about

the process of blowing up the orientifold singularities [33].

5 conclusions

in this paper we have addressed the issue of -model anomalies in d = 4, n = 1 type

iib orientifold vacua. we have presented evidence suggesting that anomalies associated

to certain modular transformations (those corresponding to complex planes rotated by

all elements in the orbifold group) are cancelled by a gs mechanism mediated by the

exchange of rr twisted closed string modes (for mixed gravitational anomalies, the

dilaton also plays a non-trivial role).

the main a priori reason to expect such cancellation is the duality of these ori-

entifolds with certain heterotic vacua, in which these anomalies cancel. in heterotic

models, this cancellation is required since a discrete version of the -model symme-

tries corresponds to t-duality, which is an exact symmetry of the full string theory.

it would be desirable to gain a better insight of -model symmetries in type i string

theory, in order to understand whether the cancellation we have discussed follows as a

consequence from a similarly deep property of string theory.

the mechanism for the cancellation of -model anomalies that we have uncovered

is analogous to the gs mechanism which cancels u(1) gauge anomalies, in that the ex-

changed elds are closed string twisted modes. in particular, this has the consequence

that the mixed anomalies are allowed to be highly non-universal with respect to the

dierent gauge factors and gravity. this diers markedly from the behaviour in het-

erotic vacua, and may be used to relax certain constraints on the low-energy spectrum

of phenomenologically interesting string vacua.

28

finally we would like to stress that our conclusions have been based on a detailed

analysis of the triangle anomalies.

in particular we have found that rewriting the

anomalies in terms of chan-paton traces is an extremely useful trick which automati-

cally exhibits the factorization properties of the anomaly. in particular, it shows clearly

the contribution of the rr twisted modes to the gs mechanism to all these amplitudes,

and, in the case of the mixed gravitational anomaly, shows the necessity of having a

non-trivial transformation of the dilaton multiplet.

the anomaly cancellation mechanism requires the existence of interesting tree-level

mixings between the ti and the twisted closed string modes, and a one-loop mixing
between the ti and the dilaton. the consequences of the existence of these couplings
should be further explored. in particular, they lead to an interesting modication for

the fi terms for the anomalous u(1)s, which for compact models do not vanish at the

orbifold point. this fact had been overlooked in previous studies of the consequences

of the fi terms.

type iib orientifolds constitute an extremaly interesting set of models, with prop-

erties often diering from the well-known behaviour of heterotic vacua. as such, they

are worthy of detailed exploration. we hope our analysis helps in adding some use-

ful information to our present knowledge of the perturbative structure of type iib

orientifold vacua.

in this appendix we discuss the contribution of the dierent xed points to the cancel-

lation of u(1) anomalies in models with d5- and d9-branes.

for a given twist k there are c 2

i=1 4 sin2 kvi) xed points. let us label by an
index p the 4 sin2 kv3 xed points, located at the origin in the rst two complex planes
and anywhere in the third. since in our models the d5-branes sit at the origin in the

k (= q3

two complex planes, it will be a combination of these twisted elds the one responsible

for the cancellation of u(1) anomalies in the d5-branes. on the other hand, d9-branes
ll the compact space completely and couple to twisted modes from all the c 2
k xed

points, which we label by an index f . let us dene
