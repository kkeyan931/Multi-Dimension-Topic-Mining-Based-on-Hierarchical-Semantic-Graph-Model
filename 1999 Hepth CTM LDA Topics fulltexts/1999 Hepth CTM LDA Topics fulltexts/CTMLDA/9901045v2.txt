abstract

the low energy eective action describing the standard kaluza-klein reduction of het-
erotic string theory on a d-torus possesses a manifest o(d, d+16) symmetry. we consider
generalized scherk-schwarz reductions of the heterotic string to construct massive gauged
supergravities. we show that the resulting action can still be written in a manifestly
o(d, d + 16) invariant form, however, the u-duality transformations also act on the mass
parameters. the latter play the dual role of dening the scalar potential and the non-
abelian structure constants. we conjecture that just as for the standard reduction, a
subgroup of this symmetry corresponds to an exact duality symmetry of the heterotic
string theory.

1 introduction

recently progress in understanding string dualities and the role of p-branes has lead to
interest in constructing massive supergravity theories through unconventional com-
pactications of massless supergravities in higher dimensions [1, 2, 3, 4]. the seminal
insight made in ref. [1] was realizing that given a theory containing an axion, that is
a massless scalar with only derivative couplings, a consistent compactication could be
made in which the axion was given a linear dependence on the internal coordinates.
while the reduced action remains independent of the internal coordinates, the slope pa-
rameters of this linear dependence appear as mass parameters in the reduced theory. as
realized in [1], these reductions are actually a special class within the general framework
developed by scherk and schwarz[5] for producing masses from dimensional reduction.
the scherk-schwarz approach focuses on the global symmetries, i.e., the u-duality sym-
metries, of the action, and the dependence on the internal coordinates takes the form of
a u-duality transformation that varies (in a specic way) over the internal space. for the
generalized axion reductions above, the relevant symmetry is the shift symmetry of the
scalar axion, and the fact that the corresponding symmetry generator is nilpotent yields
the simple linear dependence mentioned above [6]. various applications and extensions
of the generalized reductions with axionic masses were explored in [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9].

however, the picture arising from the exploratory investigations of [1] was one of many
disjoint massive supergravities in lower dimensions. this situation contrasts with the
prevailing theme in string theory of recent years in which u-duality has played a central
role in unifying disparate (supergravity and superstring) theories as various phases of a
single u-theory[12, 13]. in part, the fragmented picture for the massive supergravities
appeared because the linear ansatz described above could only accommodate specic
combinations of masses. that is in many instances where the higher dimensional theory
contained a number of axions, all of the corresponding mass parameters could not be
simultaneously turned on within this scheme. this point was claried in [6], where it
was shown that the problem arose because the corresponding axionic symmetries did not
commute. however, any combination of masses was easily accommodated within the
scherk-schwarz framework, although the reduction ansatz now involved a polynomial
(or even more general) dependence on the internal coordinates. given that there is no
restriction on the types of axionic masses, it was conjectured [6] that various distinct
massive supergravities should all be a part of a single u-duality invariant massive theory.

in the present paper, we demonstrate how the preceding conjecture is realized for
generalized toroidal compactications of heterotic string theory. in this case, the stan-
dard kaluza-klein reduction on a d-dimensional torus from 10 to 10  d dimensions
produces a theory with global o(d, d + 16) symmetry and with a u(1)2d+16 gauge group.
as shown by ref. [24], the eective action can be organized to make the former u-duality
symmetry manifest. essentially the 2d + 16 gauge elds may be assembled as a vector
under this symmetry, while there are d(d + 16) moduli scalars transforming as a traceless
symmetric tensor. we will show that this global symmetry is retained in the massive the-

action may be written as:

(2)

(the reader is invited to read the main text for a full explanation of this result.) the
essential point is that the various mass parameters introduced by the generalized reduc-
tion can be organized as a completely antisymmetric three-index tensor fabc under the
o(d, d + 16) transformations. these parameters play a dual role in the reduced theory:
rst, as mass parameters dening the scalar potential (2), and second as structure con-
stants in the non-abelian gauge group of this theory, implicitly appearing in f a
 and
dm ab. that is the generalized reduction has produced a gauged supergravity with a
nontrivial non-abelian symmetry.

a simple intuition which explains (at least in part) the emergence of this nonabelian
symmetry is as follows: the scherk-schwarz reduction introduces an axionic shift which
depends on internal coordinates. now a part of gauge symmetry in the reduced the-
ory can be thought of as local shifts of the internal coordinates. these kaluza-klein
gauge transformations are inherited from the dieomorphism invariance of original ten-
dimensional theory. hence consistency of this symmetry in the generalized reduction
requires that these gauge transformations be accompanied by a local axionic shift. that
is the latter symmetries, which are ordinarily only a part of the global u-duality group,
have now been incorporated as a part of the local gauge group. further given that these
axionic symmetries in general do not commute [6], it must be that the gauge group is
modied to become non-abelian.

for the standard kaluza-klein reduction on t d, the o(d, d + 16, r) transformations
map one conguration of background space-time elds to another conguration. now
naively, it may appear that the u-duality symmetry is broken in the reduced action (1)
by the appearance of the mass parameters fabc. however, this is only spontaneous sym-
metry breaking. in the present case, we know that these couplings are simply associated
with the presence of additional nontrivial background elds in the internal space. hence
our construction reveals that u-duality symmetry consists of the usual transformation
rules for the elds in the (10  d)-dimensional space-time supplemented by a compen-
sating transformation of the mass parameters, i.e., the nontrivial elds on the internal
space. the action (1) maintains u-duality invariance, however, the transformations also
act on the couplings fabc in the obvious way. a novel feature in the case of the gen-
eralized reductions is then that in transforming the internal elds, u-duality maps one

2

reduced theory to another with modied couplings. this u-duality covariant formalism
provides a unied framework incorporating all of the previously distinct massive su-
pergravities, which various generalized reductions could have produced for low energy
heterotic string theory. it is natural to conjecture that the o(d, d + 16, z) subgroup,
which is an exact symmetry of the full heterotic string theory with a standard toroidal
compactication[29], will remain an exact symmetry of the full string theory for the
generalized axion reductions  we mention some subtleties in section 6.

some of our results above can be seen in the previous work of ref. [3], where a simpler
scherk-schwarz reduction of the eective action of heterotic string theory produced a
gauged n = 4 supergravity theory in four dimensions. in the context of nine-dimensional
massive type ii supergravity, ref. [9] has constructed an eective action which is mani-
festly invariant under the relevant u-duality group, namely sl(2, r). hull[10] considered
the eect of duality transformations and their singular limits on gauged supergravities.
there the singular limits were used to construct new theories. further, boucher[11] also
considered dimensional reductions of d = 11 supergravity similar to those constructed
here.

the remainder of our paper is organized as follows:

in section 2, we review the
standard kaluza-klein reduction of low energy heterotic string theory on a d-torus. in
particular, we describe the global so(d, d + 16) symmetries, which form the u-duality
group for the reduced theory. section 3 presents a discussion of generalized reductions
which include constant uxes of the three-form or gauge eld strengths on the torus.
the reduced action for these compactications is assembled in the form of eq. (1), in
which the so(d, d + 16) invariance remains manifest. section 4 describes a generalized
reduction ansatz which introduces curvatures in the internal geometry, and produces
masses for the metric axions in the reduced theory. section 5 then describes the general
massive reduction involving all three sources of the masses. again, the u-duality invari-
ant form of the action (1) is recovered with a modied set of structure constants fabc.
section 6 provides a discussion of our results. in particular, we note that the formalism
introduced in section 4 and the resulting low energy action applies for more general in-
ternal geometries than the d-torus. this is followed by a number of appendices, which
contain details of the calculations made in performing the generalized reductions. a nal
appendix presents a new perspective on discussion of the generalized axion reductions
in ref. [6].

2 a review of kaluza-klein reduction

we begin with a review of the standard kaluza-klein reduction of low energy heterotic
string theory on a d-torus. our notation will be such that d + d = 10 and hence this
compactication yields an eective d-dimensional theory. in ten dimensions, the low

the ten-dimensional elds, , g, r, h and f i
, denote the dilaton, (string-frame)
metric, ricci scalar, kalb-ramond three-form eld strength, and the yang-mills eld
strengths, respectively. the d-dimensional counterparts of these elds will be denoted
with upper case latin letters, except the dilaton, which will be . our convention for the
metric signature is g = (, +, +, ..., +), and that for the curvature is r

we wish to consider the standard kaluza-klein dimensional reduction of heterotic
action (3) on a d-torus, to set the stage for scherk-schwarz reductions in the following
sections. the starting point for any compactication is a decomposition of the tensor
degrees of freedom [14]

ds2 = g(x, y)dxdx + gm n (x, y)(dym + v m

b(x, y)dxdx + bm (x, y)dxdym +

(5)

where x and ym denote the coordinates on the uncompactied and the compact internal
subspaces, respectively, with  = 0, 1, . . . , d  1 and m = 1, 2, . . . , d. as usual, there
is a summation when such indices appear repeated in a subscript-superscript pair. our
convention will be that the gauge group indices, i, j = 1, 2, . . . , 16, always appear as
superscripts, and in the following, a summation will also be implied for a pair of repeated
gauge superscripts. note that there are no assumptions about the structure of the space-
time involved in writing eq. (5). for a kaluza-klein reduction on a torus, the vector
elds m generate isometries of the system. naively, this translates into the statement
that none of elds depend on the ym s. specically, this means that

g(x, y) = g(x)

(x, y) = v m

the dimensional reduction produces a number of new scalar and vector elds. the
additional scalars are the internal components of the metric, the two-form and the gauge
elds, i.e., the elds in the third line in eq. (6). for the compactication on a d-torus,
the counting of these scalars is: d(d+1)/2 from the metric, d(d1)/2 from the two-form,
and 16d from the 16 gauge elds. thus there are a total of d(d + 16) moduli scalars in
the reduced theory.

the case of the vectors is more interesting. the o-diagonal terms in the metric and
the two-form, v m
 and bm , transform as vector elds with respect to the space-time
dieomorphisms of the d-dimensional theory, and so give rise to new u(1) gauge elds.
a closer scrutiny of eq. (5) shows that the split of the components of b and ai as given
there is not gauge-invariant as it stands. the forms dym transform under residual
dieomorphisms according to dym  dym = dym + dm (x). this translates into the
kaluza-klein gauge transformations v m
  m , which ensure the
invariance of the internal space d-bein, i.e., dym + v m
dx. however,
in the decomposition of eq. (5), the reduced yang-mills gauge elds and the vectors bm
transform nontrivially under this symmetry. to demonstrate manifest gauge invariance,
ones best route is to consider the kinetic terms in the action on the tangent space,
and carry dimensional reduction there, using the gauge-invariant vielbein. this is the
standard procedure used for the dimensional reduction of supergravity theories [15].
when the result of this calculation is pulled back to the holonomic d-dimensional basis,
it is guaranteed to be manifestly gauge invariant. after straightforward but tedious
algebraic manipulations with the reduction formulas, we nd that the reduced degrees of
freedom, with simple gauge transformation properties, are given in terms of the original
higher-dimensional degrees of freedom as follows:

dx  dym + v m

  v m

in appendix b, we give the generalization of the calculation leading to eq. (7) for the case
when various axionic masses are turned on. eq. (7) can be easily deduced from there
by setting all masses to zero. hence we will merely quote the result here. the vector
elds bm and ai
 comprise the full multiplet of 2d + 16 abelian
u(1) gauge elds, with simple, decoupled, gauge transformation properties. their eld
strengths will be denoted: v m

the reduced action in d dimensions may be decomposed as follows [14]:

in addition to the original yang-mills chern-simons terms, the three-form eld strength
now also contains the induced chern-simons terms arising for the new gauge elds
appearing in the reduction. these additional terms essential in establishing the duality
symmetries (see below) as shown in [14], and remain important in that context when
higher derivative corrections are also included [18].

the reduced low energy theory has a global o(d, d + 16, r) symmetry [14, 16]. this
symmetry is a generalization of t -duality symmetry, which interchanges string momen-
tum and winding modes [17].
in order to make this duality symmetry manifest, we
must introduce some additional notation. towards this end, let us dene a new set of
(lower-case latin) indices which take values a, b = 1, 2, . . . , 2d + 16. then o(d, d + 16)
transformations may be dened as any real matrices a

where 1 are d  d unit matrices and 1 a 16  16 unit matrix. in more conventional
matrix notation, we may write eq. (14) as  l t = l, where the superscript t indicates
matrix transposition. we will denote the inverse of the metric (14) as lab, even though
it is precisely the same matrix.

now following [14, 16], we can dene the reduced gauge multiplet according to

in keeping with the index notation, these gauge elds transform in the fundamental
representation of o(d, d + 16), i.e., aa  aa = a
bf b. from
the notation introduced here, we also note that it is useful to keep in mind that an
o(d, d + 16) superscript runs over a contravariant index on the internal d-torus, a co-
variant index on the same space, and a gauge index labeling the sixteen cartan gen-
erators, i.e., x a = {x m , xm , x i}. lowering the o(d, d + 16) superscript with the
inverse of the invariant metric (14) interchanges the rst two sets of components, e.g.,
xa = labx b = {xm , x m , x i}.

the scalar moduli elds, which parameterize the internal components of the metric,
two-form and the yang-mills elds, may also be assembled in a form covariant under the
duality transformations. using the d  d matrices g = (gm n ), b = (bm n ), and mixed
d  16 matrix a = (ai

of parameters in the coset. under the duality transformations, these scalars transform
as: m ab  m ab = a

where all of the gauge anomaly contributions now appear on the same footing[14]. the

given the invariance of l in eq. (14), this action and hence the equations of motion are
obviously invariant under the o(d, d + 16) rotations: m  mt and f  f (using
matrix notation). this group includes dieomorphisms and gauge transformations on the
d-torus, which are inherited from the reduction of the metric, torsion, and gauge elds.
these elements of o(d, d+16) essentially rearrange the components of these tensors. the
nontrivial part[25, 26] of the o(d, d+16) group is the coset o(d, d+16)/o(d)o(d+16).

7

before proceeding, we comment on the origin of the u(1)2d+16 gauge symmetry of
the reduced theory. the factor u(1)16 is obviously inherited from the sixteen abelian
gauge elds already present in the ten-dimensional theory. as commented above, a
further u(1)d comes from residual dieomorphisms on the internal space dym  dym =
dym + dm (x). one might think of this as a local gauging of the translation symmetries
of the internal torus. the remaining u(1)d symmetry arises as a residual one-form gauge
invariance with b  b = b + d where  = m (x)dym . we will see below how this
gauge symmetry group is modied by the introduction of axionic masses.

3 reduction with internal fluxes

the standard kaluza-klein reduction, described above, can be generalized by the in-
troduction of a constant ux of the three-form or gauge eld strengths on a three- or
two-cycle in the internal space. these compactications are then similar to the type
ii string and m-theory reductions considered in ref. [4]. note that a constant internal
ux requires that the corresponding potential necessarily depends on the internal co-
ordinates. these uxes, or alternatively the slopes for the internal dependence for the
potentials, then appear as mass parameters in the reduced theory. there is also another
set of masses related to certain components of the internal metric, but the discussion of
these contributions is more involved and we will leave their discussion for the following
section.

using the same decomposition as in eq. (5), the internal uxes are produced by

including an explicit dependence on the internal coordinates in the following elds:

m (x) + mi

m (x, y) = ai

ai
m n yn
bm (x, y) = bm (x) +
m n yn (ai
mi
bm n (x, y) = bm n (x) + m n p yp + ai

1
2

p v p

(x))

(x) + ai
[m (x)mi

n ]p yp

(19)

the other elds reduce exactly as in eq. (6). in this decomposition, the quantities without
the caret are the local uctuations on the base space, i.e., they are independent of the yn .
the ansatz (19) can be easily deduced from considering the eld strengths of ai and b on
the tangent space and requiring that their uxes on the compact space are independent
of the internal coordinates. again, the details represent the special case of the general
situation discussed in the appendices b and c, when we take the internal space to
be a at d-torus without twists (i.e., with vanishing curvatures), so that the internal
isometries commute. for this reason, we will not delve here into a detailed derivation
of (19) but merely quote it. the parameters m n p comprise a totally antisymmetric
constant tensor in m, n, p , and stem from the three-form uxes on the internal torus.
the constant matrices mi = (mi
m n ) are counted by i and antisymmetric in m, n, and
they correspond to the internal uxes in the yang-mills sector. note that implicitly we
are following the (string theory) convention that the elds are dimensionless, and hence

8

the ux parameters, m n p and mi
parameters will appear as mass parameters in the reduced theory.

m n , have the dimension of length1. hence these

not all mi

m n s are independent, however. as we mentioned above, the reduction
ansatz must ensure that the reduced eld strengths simultaneously satisfy both their
equations of motion and are independent of the internal coordinates ym . if we apply
the latter demand to the tangent space components of the three-form eld strength, we
nd that hm n p /yq = 0. this means that the form dh cannot have terms which
completely reside in the compact space, as long as it is a at torus without curvature,
with the one-form basis dym on its tangent space. however, since dh =  1
2f i f i, this
translates into the condition that the chern-simons anomaly components must vanish
in the internal space. this condition yields

mi

[m n mi

p q] = 0

(20)

m n are antisymmetric in the lower two indices, we can rewrite (20) as mi
qn + mi

m n mi
n p = 0. aside from these constraints, the mass parameters mi

m qmi

p q+

m n

since mi
mi
m p mi
are arbitrary.

in passing, we note that the ansatz (19) is linear in the internal coordinates despite the
explicit presence of the corresponding axionic scalars without derivatives in the reduced
action. one might not have expected choosing this form to succeed, given our previous
results in ref. [6] on generalized axion reductions. in fact, however, the analysis there
and our present results are not in conict, as discussed in appendix e.

using eq. (19), we can proceed with the dimensional reduction of the action (3). we
will keep the discussion here as brief as possible, since this is just a special case of the
more general reduction on a twisted torus that we will consider later. the best way
of carrying out dimensional reduction is to follow the approach based on using gauge
symmetry as the organizing principle for identifying the reduced dynamics. to do so,
we use the tangent space basis dened by the zehnbein, with components

to actually identify the reduced degrees of freedom, all one needs to do is to take

mann curvature forms), f i and h in the intermediate basis spanned by dx, e a =

the expressions for the riemann curvature can be obtained by straightforward methods.
since the metric and dilaton reduction ansatz is the same as in the conventional kaluza-
klein case, the curvature and the dilaton make precisely the same contributions as in
the previous section.

we can now reduce the action (3) using these results. this will generalize the kaluza-
klein reduction of the low energy heterotic action considered in [14]. the net result of

in the moduli action (28), the function w (gm n ,ai

which arises because of the internal uxes. they will in general induce an eective

note that this moduli potential is independent of the two-form axions bm n .

at this point we wish to rewrite the reduced action (26) in a more tractable form,
which would highlight the symmetries of the reduced theory. in particular, we wish to
determine what became of the o(d, d + 16) symmetry which appeared in the standard
kaluza-klein reduction. further, the denitions (24) and (25) already suggest that the
reduced gauge symmetries have become nonabelian with the internal uxes. below, we
will conrm this with a detailed examination of the gauge symmetries of the reduced
theory. let us rst try to intuitively understand how the nonabelian symmetry is pro-
duced. for this purpose, we can focus on the yang-mills gauge transformations. the
gauge symmetries of the kalb-ramond gauge elds (i.e., the gauge elds arising from
the reduction of the two-form) behave exactly the same. the yang-mills gauge trans-
formations are the sixteen commuting symmetry transformations of the gauge elds ai,
under which ai  ai = ai + di. from the point of view of the scherk-schwarz
reduced theory, these gauge transformations can be at most quadratic in ym , in order
not to alter the general form of the reduction ansatz (19). hence, the general allowed
form of gauge transformations is i(x, y) = i(x) + i
m n (x)ym yn . here,
i
n m (x) or else it would disappear from the denition above. further, if
we turn o the kaluza-klein gauge elds, i
m n must be constant. using the
reduction ansatz for ai, we see that the gauge transformation properties of the elds ai
decompose according to

since i
m n are constants, we see that these transformations by i has three
separate eects: first, the i(x) yield the reduced version of the original u(1)16 gauge
symmetry appearing in the action (3). then, we obtain the global axionic symmetries,
which shift the scalars ai
m n transformations
simply ensure that only the antisymmetric part of mi
m n are physical. in other words,
even if we had started with a general class of parameters mi
m n , we can make them
antisymmetric by i
m n -dependent gauge transformations, leaving the rest unchanged.

m by constants. finally, we see that the i

the kaluza-klein vectors v m

 do not change under these transformation. however,
due to the chern-simons terms, the two-form potential b does transform, according to

b =

if i + d

(34)

2mi

where  is a residual two-form gauge transformation playing role of a custodian, which
sweeps away total derivatives. it is easy to verify that the explicit form of  should be
 = 1
2iai. this guarantees that the reduction ansatz for the two-
form in eq. (19) is gauge invariant. this induces nontrivial transformation properties of
the elds which emerge from the two-form b after the reduction. their explicit form
will be given below. here we rst note that the parameters m n p change according to

m n iyn dym  1

m n p  

m n p = m n p  2i

[m mi

(35)

from eq. (23), we see that eq. (33) and (35) combine to ensure that the internal ux of
h remains unchanged by the axionic shifts of ai

m .

turning the kaluza-klein gauge transformations on corresponds to gauging the global
axionic translations associated with the metric axions. the resulting gauge group must
be nonabelian because of the anomaly in the two-form b. the anomaly is manifest in the
presence of the vector supermultiplet chern-simons terms in eq. (4). it gets enlarged
further by reduction, because of the gauge anomalous decomposition of the reduced
two-form b.

without further ado, we give here the nal form of the innitesimal form of the
full set of reduced gauge transformations. they can be obtained by straightforward,
albeit lengthy computation, of which the general case is given in appendix d. hence
the case of the at torus, which is considered here, can be recovered as a special case.
we only list the reduced vector eld gauge transformations, and leave aside the one-
form gauge transformations of the reduced two-form eld. these reduced innitesimal
gauge transformations fall into three categories, listed here in the order of ascending
complexity:

here those elds that are not listed above explicitly are invariant under the corresponding
transformations.

we can now determine the algebra of the gauge group dened by eqs. (36)-(38).
understanding the full structure of the gauge symmetry is facilitated by adopting the
o(d, d + 16) notation introduced previously, which combines the three sets of gauge
elds in a single multiplet (15). we can then dene a combined gauge transformation
parameter

a = (m , m , i) .

(39)

now the proper way to examine the gauge symmetries is to introduce the corresponding
generators ta, where the index now takes values in the space of { m , m , i}, of dimension
2d + 16. we explicitly denote the separate generators as ta = (zm , x m , y i)  note the
order: rst kaluza-klein, then kalb-ramond and nally yang-mills. we expect that
their algebra satises

[ta, tb] = ifab

ctc

(40)

c are some structure constants to be determined. to nd them, we consider
where fab
the successive application of gauge transformations (3638) of the form h1  g1  h  g
where h and g are two of any of the three above types of gauge transformations. we can
use the baker-hausdor formula to determine the product. innitesimally, for any two
operators a, b and a number  we have eabea = b + [a, b] + o(2) where [
]
denotes the commutator. if g = exp(ia
2ta), with gauge parameters
a

hence we nd that, to the lowest order

,

h1  g1  h  g = 1 + a

1 b

2[ta, tb] = 1 + ifab

2tc

(41)

substituting the explicit form of the reduced gauge transformations (3638), we can
deduce the structure constants. since they do not depend on a representation, we need

13

to project the operator expression (41) on a set of basis vectors of a faithful irreducible
representation of the gauge group. in other words, we should evaluate h1  g1  h g|i
for a set of basis vectors |i. vector elds must provide a faithful representation, and
hence using (3638), we nd the following equations for the structure constants:

f i

m n = fm n

i = 2mi

m n

fm n p = 3m n p

(42)

these equations must hold in order to get the rules for the combination of gauge trans-
formation functions, m = n if i
2 =
3p n m m
2 , as can be seen from the comparison of the compositions with the original
gauge transformations. hence nally, the gauge algebra is

m n n i and p = fm n p m

n m = 2mi

1 n

1 n

[x m , x n ] = [y i, y j ] = [x m , y i] = [x m , zn ] = 0
[y i, zm ] = 2imi

m n x n

[zm , zn ] = 3im n p x p + 2imi

m n y i

(43)

thus we see that the reduced gauge group is indeed nonabelian with the internal ux
parameters playing the role of the structure constants.

dfbd

in order to rewrite the reduced theory in the form where the nonabelian gauge sym-
metry is manifest, we rst need to dene a metric on the lie algebra of the gauge
group. normally, one would use the standard cartan metric on a lie algebra, given by
c. however, from eq. (43) in our example the gauge algebra is not semi-
cab = fac
simple. this implies that the cartan metric is degenerate, and so without an inverse.
by comparing the gauge algebra with the algebra of the o(d, d + 16) duality group which
arises in the reduced action, one can verify that the gauge algebra has become embedded
in the duality algebra. the reason is that the nonabelian gauge transformations, as dic-
tated by eq. (43), now mix the gauge generators, a function previously reserved solely for
the duality transformations. however, even without this observation, and by considering
the case of the standard massless kaluza-klein reduction from the previous section, we
see that the natural metric in the gauge algebra can be dened by hta, tbi  lab. we
will return to this interplay of the gauge and u-duality group later.

identifying our lie-algebra-valued one-form gauge potential as

a = aata = v m zm + bm x m + aiy i

we nd that the corresponding nonabelian eld strength

f = da + ia  a =

1

tadx  dx
f a

(44)

(45)

has components which coincide with the expressions for eld strengths (24) that come
from dimensional reduction:

the coupling constant may appear to be normalized to unity in eq. (45). more accurately,
the coupling is absorbed into the structure constants (42), as the ux parameters are by
the present analysis arbitrary in magnitude.

we can also compute the chern-simons form for the gauge eld (44). the result is

which corresponds to precisely the anomaly contribution in the reduced three-form eld
strength, obtained by dimensional reduction, and given in eq. (31). hence, we see that
with the internal uxes all of the chern-simons contributions terms in eq. (31) can be
organized into a single nonabelian structure, and that, in form notation, the reduced
three-form eld strength is then simply

h = db 

1
2

cs .

(49)

this is exactly what is needed to maintain simultaneously u-duality and gauge invari-
ance. the transformation formulas for b always contain the anomalous gauge trans-
formation of b. this is essential to establish the o(d, d + 16) duality invariance of the
reduced theory, as shown by maharana and schwarz [14]. however, in the case of the
scherk-schwarz dimensional reduction, there are additional terms arising in order to ac-
count for additional nonlinearities present in the chern-simons sector, and we have seen
here that these are precisely in the form of the nonabelian anomalous contributions.

finally, we can put the moduli potential (32) in a symmetric form. we lower the
last index of the structure constants to dene the completely antisymmetric tensor in
dld|c]. using this tensor and the moduli matrix m ab introduced
the lie group fabc = f[ab
in eq. (16), we can write the potential for these scalars as:

w (m) = w (g,b,a) =

m adm bem cf fabcfdef

further, the constraint (20) for the masses mi

[abmi

cd] = 0 is encoded in

ladfa[bcfd|ef ] =

1
3

lad(cid:16)fabcfdef + fabefdf c + fabf fdce(cid:17) = 0

(50)

(51)

that is, the ux constraint is precisely the only nontrivial component of the jacobi
c as in eq. (42) and
identity for the lie algebra dened with the structure constants fab
with the metric lab.

armed with these expressions, we can write down the reduced action in the manifestly
covariant form. having squared away the anomaly, we note that the gauge kinetic terms

15

in the reduced action (29) can be rewritten as

precisely as before, although the eld strengths (46) are now nonabelian. the nonabelian
eld strengths vary under gauge transformations according to

f 2 = f a

labm bclcdf d

(52)

(53)

af a

 tb

f  f 

 = u  f  u 1 = f a

u  ta  u 1 = u b
hence, the transformation law for the gauge eld strength is f a
. gauge
invariance of the kinetic terms thus demands that the matrix m must also transform
nontrivially under the nonabelian group, in contrast to the simple abelian situation
encountered in standard kaluza-klein reduction. indeed, we nd
m ab  m ab = u a

(54)
where mab  lacm cdldb. the second transformation is derived by noting that the gauge
transformation u a
b is a o(d, d+16) matrix. hence since f a transform as an adjoint of the
gauge group, m ab transforms as a (symmetrized) product of the two adjoints. therefore,
the kinetic terms for the moduli elds must contain gauge covariant derivatives

(55)

combining the various expressions above, one nds that these expressions are reproduced
precisely by the derivatives (25) appearing in the scalar kinetic terms in eq. (28).

the reduced action can therefore be put in a u-duality invariant form:

(56)

hence the generalized reduction has produced an eective d-dimensional action of a
form very similar to that (18) produced by the standard kaluza-klein reduction. the
main dierences arise in the appearance of a nonabelian gauge symmetry and the scalar
potential w (m). the parameters introduced by the internal uxes play a dual role
as structure constants in the nonabelian group, and mass couplings determining the
potential for the moduli. with respect to the duality symmetry, it may appear from the
form of the action (56) that the o(d, d + 16) symmetry is still present but in a slightly
broken form, due to the constants fabc. an alternate point of view, which we advocate,
is that o(d, d + 16) is a symmetry of the reduced theory, and that we are discovering
here that the usual transformations, m  m  = mt and f  f  = f , must be
supplemented by a transformation of the uxes:

4 twisted tori

we now turn to the question of inducing masses in general. in particular, we wish to in-
clude mass parameters arising from internal coordinate dependence of the metric. metric
axion masses may be associated with axionic symmetries for internal metric components,
and so an easy way to identify these is to rst reduce the theory by the standard kaluza-
klein procedure and then look for axionic symmetries in the reduced theory. in toroidal
standard reductions, a metric axion rst appears from the o-diagonal component of
the internal metric in compactifying on a two-torus. hence a mass parameter can be
generated by introducing an internal coordinate dependence in this axion in a further s1
reduction. geometrically, the axionic symmetry above corresponds to a constant shift
in the modular parameter of the two-torus. the subsequent reduction then produces a
nontrivial sl(2, r) bre bundle with t 2 bre over s1. that is the t 2 geometry varies
in traversing the s1, and in one cycle, its metric only returns to its original form up
to an sl(2, r) transformation. thus the resulting geometry is similar to that appear-
ing around a stringy cosmic string [31], whose construction relies on the same axionic
symmetry of the two-torus reduction. this geometry was also recently discussed[8, 9]
in relating m-theory to massive iia string theory. we will refer to this three-torus with
such nontrivial curvature and its higher dimensional generalizations as twisted tori.

a sequential dimensional descent extending the t 3 reduction described above may
not be the most useful tool to derive the most general array of metric mass parameters.
further the geometric picture does not give us a clear picture of the most general com-
pactication. in the following, we will consider a generalized ansatz in which the internal
components of the metric can have complicated dependence on internal coordinates, re-
stricted only by the requirement that the internal manifold has an isometry group acting
transitively on it [34]. indeed, as we will see, the general procedure to turn on all avail-
able metric mass terms is to perform dimensional reduction on all nonabelian isometry
groups consistent with the dimension of the compact space. that is, while throughout
this section, we have in mind the twisted tori described above, the formalism developed
here and the subsequent results apply for more general compactications. the essential
ingredient is an isometry group with a transitive action and with the same dimension as
the internal space. hence the topology of the internal manifold is not restricted to be
homeomorphic to bered tori, and we will consider explicit examples in section 6.

our construction is motivated by the general considerations of [5], and a concrete
example provided in ref. [19]. the compactication considered there may be interpreted
as a twisted three-torus. explicitly, the basis one-forms on this torus were found to
be 1 = dx + q(ydz  zdy), 2 = dy, 3 = dz. this basis contains a noncommutative
structure, as can be seen from the fact that d1 = 2q2  3. this in turn resulted
in a nonabelian isometry group of the internal space, with the nontrivial commutator
between the dual killing vectors:
[z2, z3] = 2qz1. this algebra is known from the
studies of homogeneous anisotropic spaces under the name of bianchi ii algebra. the
vector elds zm are generators of generalized translations, which leave the geometry

17

invariant. hence the notion of homogeneity.

our generalized ansatz builds on the above result with the introduction of tangent

space basis forms on the internal manifold of the form

e a = e a

m (x) m (y, dy)

(58)

where the one-forms m are allowed to depend on the internal coordinates, in such a way
that they yield all allowed isometry groups with the dimension of the lie algebra equal to
the given dimension of the internal space. the killing isometries generalize the internal
space translations present in the simplest reductions on at tori. the corresponding
killing vector elds zm , which generate these isometries, are dual to the basis one-forms
m , i.e., zm (n ) = m
n . to bring the full force of symmetry to good use, we dene the
m (y) from the holonomic basis dym to the twisted basis m :
pullback functions nn

m = nn

m (y)dyn .

(59)

since the matrix nn
on a smooth manifold. let its inverse be n m
dym = n m
and its inverse depended linearly on ym .

m (y) is a map between two bases, it must be everywhere invertible
n (y), so that the inverse map to (59) is
m (y)

n (y)n . for the simple reduction in the bianchi ii example, both nn

the killing vector elds can be expressed in terms of the holonomic coordinate vector

elds m = 

ym and the inverse pullback matrix n m

n (y) as

zm = n n

m (y)n

they must satisfy a lie algebra specied by a set of xed structure constants 2m
n p

[zm , zn ] = 2p

m n zp

(60)

(61)

where we have introduced the factor of 2 for later convenience. the dual map between
m and zm then implies2

by the bianchi identity for basis one-forms, d2n = 0, we see that the structure constants
must satisfy

dm = m

n p n  p

(62)

m
r[n r

p q] = 0

(63)

where the square brackets denote antisymmetrization of the enclosed indices. this iden-
tity must hold for any set of values of m, n, p, q. hence, the symmetry algebra is
encoded in the commutation relations of killing isometries (61) and derivatives of their
dual one-forms (62). the structure constants m
n p of the isometry group on the internal
n = 0 we have zn (lzm p ) =
m n . next, lzm p = d(zm (p )) + zm (dp ). therefore,
m n m  n , we nd that
m n = p

[zm , zn ](p ) = 2q
if we expand the two-form dp in terms of the basis forms, dp = p
zn (lzm p ) = 2p

2this can be seen as follows. from lzm (zn (p )) = lzm m

m n zq(p ) = 2p
m n . thus we arrive at p

m n , and dp = p

m n m  n , as claimed.

18

space will play the role of axionic masses in the reduced theory. this is evident from the
simple bianchi ii example considered in ref. [19].

a nal constraint on m

n p can be obtained by considering the volume form on the
m )ddy. invariance of this measure

internal space, vd = 1
under the killing isometries zm implies [5]

d! n1...ndn1  ...  nd = det(nn

n
n m = 0 .

(64)

we can see this as follows: we require that lzm vd = 0 where l denotes the lie derivative.
for dierential forms, one has l = di + id where i denotes the interior product with
a vector . further in the case of interest dvd = 0 since it is the top form on the internal
space, and so

lzm vd = dizm vd = ()m +1d(cid:16)1  . . .bm . . .  d(cid:17)

where the caret denotes that m does not appear in the wedge product. given the
exterior derivatives of the basis forms in (62), it is not hard to see that lzm vd = n
n m vd,
and so invariance requires eq. (64).

(65)

let us now consider the innitesimal form of the isometries, which we determine from
the lie algebra. since an innitesimal transformation of a tensor eld t generated by
a killing eld z = p zp can be written as t = lzt , we see that the basis 1-forms
transform according to
(66)

m m

n  ()n = s n

where the matrix sm
n () belongs to the adjoint of the group of dieomorphisms on the
internal space dened by (61). hence, this matrix can be written in innitesimal form
as

it will be useful to also dene the matrix om
innitesimal form,
n () = m

sm

om

n () = m

n  2m

n p p (x)

(67)
n (), as formally a square root of s. in
(68)

n p p (x)

n  m

this matrix will encode the gauge transformations of the gauge elds after dimensional
reduction. to see this, we can take the parameters m (x) to depend on the base space
coordinates, in which case the transformations of the basis 1-forms m obey

m = sm

n n  om

n dn

(69)

where dn = n dx takes into account the fact that n are dened as local functions
on the reduced base space. the factor of 2 in sm
n comes about because the charge of
m is 1, and the structure constants are 2m

n p .

for completeness we note that we can dene the invariant forms under the action
of the symmetry group (67). the simplest way to construct them is to rst look for
invariant vector elds, and then determine their duals. the invariant vector elds are

19

 m = n m

n dyn

dened by lzmy = 0 for all zm . writing out this condition explicitly, we see that the
most general solution is
(70)
where x m are arbitrary constants. hence the maximal set of vector elds invariant
under (67) is the set of ym = nm

n n . their dual one-forms

m m = x mym

are also invariant under the isometry group, lzm  n = 0. note that in the terminology
of group manifolds the forms  m correspond to the right-invariant maurer-cartan forms
on the group space, whilst our basis 1-forms m correspond to the left-invariant maurer-
cartan forms. having chosen m as the basis 1-forms, we have elected to express the
internal metric in terms of the left-invariant forms. one might be tempted to use the
forms  m for the dimensional reduction of invariant objects, but encoding the isometries
with the use of the left-invariant generators zm . however, as we will discuss below,
this is not the optimal starting point for dimensional reduction in our case, since it is
incapable of recording axionic shift symmetries, necessary to turn the axionic masses on.
as it turns out, this can be accomplished with the use of the basis one-forms m which
are dual to the group generators.

at this point we need to dene the proper ansatz for the dimensional reduction with
the group of isometries as dened by eqs. (61) and (62). this is a subtle issue due
to the large number of degrees of freedom and the interplay of dierent symmetries
present in the model. the ansatz for the reduction must correctly convert the original
symmetries of the compactication manifold into the reduced gauge symmetries, while
simultaneously ensuring the equivalence of the dynamics.
in other words, the ansatz
must be consistent with the ten-dimensional equations of motion in that the variations
of the reduced action produce the same set of equations. we begin by considering rst
the reduction ansatz for the metric. the choice of zm s as the symmetry generators
implies that the consistent ansatz for the nonabelian kaluza-klein reduction where the
symmetry group is dened by eqs. (61) and (62) is found by expressing the metric on
the internal manifold as a bilinear combination of the basis one-forms m . when the
group is gauged, and the forms m transform according to (69), we must introduce the
 to compensate the dm terms in (69). it is not hard to
kaluza-klein gauge elds v m
see that this implies the following ansatz for the reduction of the metric:

ds2 = g(x)dxdx + gm n (x)(m (y) + v m

(72)
the matrix gm n (x) contains the desired axionic degrees of freedom, which can be seen
as follows: first, the transformation rule for m in (69) requires that the vector eld
v m

(x)dx)(n (y) + v n

 transforms according to

(x)dx)

v m

it identies the d-bein as an array of scalars belonging to both the singlet and the
adjoint (with charge 1) representations of the isometry group. as we alluded to at the
beginning of this section, this is precisely the transformation rule needed for extracting
the axionic degrees of freedom. they can be explicitly found by carrying out the gauss
decomposition of the matrix e m
n and identifying the pivots with the dilatonic degrees
of freedom and the upper triangular matrix elements with the axions. for example on

with the dilatons i and the axions a(ij)
. we will proceed with the dimensional reduction
on the metric (72) in the next section. here we merely pause to note that the tangent
space basis forms can be expressed in terms of e = e

dx and

0

e a = e a

n (n + v n

(78)

which are invariant under the isometry group, as can be seen from combining (69), (73)
and (76).

we now sketch the ansatze for the simultaneous reduction of the vector elds ai and
the two-form potential b consistent with the above metric ansatze  see appendices b
and c for the complete details. it is clear that the vector elds must be expressed as

ai = ai

(x)dx + ai

m (x)m + i(y)

(79)

where the forms i are to be determined shortly. the reason for this form of the ansatz
is that it ensures the correct transformation rules for ai
m (x) after the reduction, so
that it retains its role as the axion of the reduced theory. if we had attempted to reduce
the gauge eld ai such that this term were replaced by ai
m  m , where  m were the
invariant one-forms dened in (71), the reduced quantity ai
m would have been gauge

21

singlets, and hence would not have transformed as given in (38) in the limit m
ln = 0.
eq. (79) is the only possibility for reduction which could reduce to the correct limit as
dened in (38). to determine i, we turn to the gauge eld strength f i = dai. direct
evaluation gives

n p n  p + di
however by requiring the covariance of the reduced theory we must have

f i = [ai

f i = [ai

(81)

which formally coincides with (22) in the limit m
n p = 0. note that this expression must
be valid in general, for any internal isometry group. here mi
n p are constants which are
antisymmetric in the lower two indices, and in the limit m
n p = 0 they must become
identical with the axionic yang-mills masses discussed in the previous section. in terms
of the mi

m n , we nd that

di = mi
the integrability condition for (82) gives mi

q[m q

n p ]m  n  p = 0, which leads to

(83)

which, as we will see, will turn out to be exactly one of the jacobi identities for the
structure constants of the reduced theory. comparing (79) with the ansatz for ai(x, y)
in (19) shows that they coincide when m
n p = 0, while the constraint (83) disappears.
hence (79) and the solution of (82) together comprise the reduction ansatz for the yang-
mills gauge elds.

the last remaining ingredient for the reduction ansatz is the two-form potential b.
we can always write b in the form given in (5). we have to assign the ym dependence
to the components of b in such a way as to ensure that the three-form eld strength
h is independent of ym if expanded in the dx, m , or equivalently, e,e m basis. the
former basis is much more convenient for calculational simplicity, and we use it here. in
this basis,

h =

2hm n dx  m  n +

2hm dx  dx  m

(84)

on the other hand, h = db 1
using (79) and (81), to nd

2aif i. we can evaluate the chern-simons contribution,

since this expression contains the terms which depend explicitly on ym s, we must choose
the ansatz for b such that this dependence cancels, and the components of h in the
dx, m basis depend explicitly only on x. with this ansatz, the eld strength becomes

the constants m n p are the axionic masses for the two-form, which become identical to
their corresponding parameters discussed in the previous section when m

we also have an additional constraint. the integrability condition for the eld strength,
which follows from its denition, is dh =  1
2f i f i. substituting in this equation (86)
and (81), we nd the following expression relating m n p , m

n p , and mi

this relation represents the last of the jacobi identities for the structure constants of
the gauge group of the reduced theory m

this equation reduces to (20), as it should. note however that the general form of (86)
must remain completely unchanged regardless of the explicit ansatz for reduction, which
contains information about the symmetry algebra. this is a consequence of symmetry.
the only eect of a more complicated realization of internal symmetry is to increase the
number of independent structure constants, but without changing the form of (86).

hence the consistent reduction ansatze for our most general massive supergravity
which can be derived from any scherk-schwarz reduction is given by equations (72) and
(79), plus the appropriate reduction ansatz for the b eld yielding (86). note that we
have not needed to present the explicit form of the internal coordinate dependence ap-
pearing in the basis forms m . this dependence is implicitly xed by the symmetry
algebra given in (61) and (62). in the simplest examples, this dependence may be sim-
ply polynomial, but more complicated transcendental functions can also arise. we will
complete the reduction of the action to the form which is manifestly invariant under
both gauge and u-duality transformations in the next section. as we have discussed
in the previous two sections, the gauge symmetries of the reduced theory come in four
avors: the yang-mills gauge symmetries which already present in ten-dimensions; the
kaluza-klein gauge symmetries which arise from dieomorphisms on the internal space;
the kalb-ramond gauge symmetries, which are similarly related to gauge transforma-
tions of the two-form on the internal space; and the remaining two-form u(1) gauge
symmetry, which however remains decoupled from the one-form gauge symmetries by
lorentz invariance.

5 general massive reductions

at this point, we are ready to carry out the reduction of the action (3) from 10 to d
dimensions, using the ansatze (72), (79) and (86), with the set of mass parameters m
n p ,
mi
m n and m n p . we will not give the detailed computation here, which can be found
in the appendix, but merely quote the results. first, it is convenient to split the action
into three sectors: the metric-dilaton, yang-mills, and kalb-ramond three-from, and we
discuss each of them separately.

we begin with the metric-dilaton sector, which is given by

sg = z d10xgenr(g) + ()2o

(88)

using the ansatz (72) and the splitting of the zehnbein in terms of the d-bein e and
d-bein e a dened in (78), we can expand the ten-dimensional ricci scalar and dilaton
in terms of elds in the d-dimensional space-time. the action (88) becomes

(90)
and where the covariant derivative of the moduli gm n emerges because of the axionic
degrees of freedom contained in the matrix gm n : we have gm n = abe a
n and
the transformation rule (76), which induces (74). hence the local derivatives of gm n
must be dened covariantly, since it contains a symmetric bilinear of adjoint elds with
charge 1 with respect to the nonabelian kaluza-klein group. it can be easily veried
that the determinant of gm n does not contain any axionic elds, however, and so is a
gauge singlet. that it why we can still shift the ten-dimensional dilaton in the usual
way in (90) to get the d-dimensional dilaton.

we can now reduce the yang-mills sector. the ten-dimensional action is

where bm and b are dened in (7), and still are the correct quantities to express the
reduced action, in a manifestly gauge and u-duality symmetric way.

to reassemble the reduced terms (89), (92) and (95) into a manifestly symmetric
action in d dimensions, we rst need to establish the correct gauge algebra of the
reduced theory, and identify the gauge invariant couplings of elds. proceeding as before,
we rst give the innitesimal reduced gauge transformations. details of their derivation

25

can be found in appendix d. as before, the small gauge transformations fall into three
categories, listed here in the order of ascending complexity. the elds not listed below
explicitly are invariant under the corresponding transformations. the reduced gauge
transformations are now:

note that in the last set of gauge transformations, we have nontrivial transformation
rules for the moduli gm n . this arises from the nontrivial couplings of the metric axions,
which were absent in the section 3 where the metric mass parameters m
n p were set to
zero.

now as in eq. (39), we dene a combined gauge parameter

and generators: ta = (zm , x m , y i). the algebra of the latter

[ta, tb] = ifab

c. to compute these, we again consider the
products of transformations (98100) of the form h1  g1  h  g where h and g are two
of gauge transformations with g = exp(ia
2ta). hence substituting
the explicit form of the gauge transformations (98100), we can deduce the structure
constants. we evaluate h1  g1  h g|i for the set of basis states dened by the vector
elds. the structure constants are, as expected,

while the standard cartan metric on this lie algebra (104) is still degenerate, since the
gauge algebra is not semi-simple, we can nevertheless dene the metric on the gauge
algebra by hta, tbi = lab, exactly as before.

formally keeping the denition of the lie-algebra-valued gauge eld one-form poten-

tial given in eq. (44), we nd that the lie-algebra-valued gauge eld strength

we can also put the moduli potential in a duality symmetric form. lowering the last

(109)

note the additional term linear in m which was absent in the formula (50) obtained with
nontrivial uxes in the matter sector. this is, of course, consistent with our previous
results. using the structure constants found in eq. (42), i.e., m
n p = 0, this linear term
automatically vanishes. this new terms only nontrivial contribution here is the last
interaction appearing in eq. (89), which is linear in g and quadratic in the m

lad(cid:16)fabcfdef + fabefdf c + fabf fdce(cid:17) = 0

(111)

it now remains to note that we can also collect the gauge kinetic terms and the
moduli terms in the manifestly gauge- and duality-invariant fashion. the gauge elds
transform according to

f a
 = u a

bf b


(112)

where u a

b is an o(d, d + 16) matrix. thus the moduli elds transform according to

m ab = u a

cu b

dm cd

(113)

under the same gauge transformations, and we see that the covariant derivative of the
scalar moduli can be written as

dm ab = m ab  fcd

aac

m db  fcd

bac

m ad .

(114)

these are indeed identical with the expressions which were obtained by reduction. with
this it can be easily shown that the gauge kinetic terms can be collected into the covariant
expression

which is formally the same as (56), albeit the structure of the gauge group is more
complicated. hence as before, the general massive reductions produce reduced theories
with a remarkably symmetric form, where a part of the o(d, d + 16) duality must be
gauged in order to accommodate the couplings induced by the mass terms.

6 discussion

above we have shown that, under generalized scherk-schwarz reductions on a twisted
d-dimensional torus, low energy heterotic string theory is manifestly invariant under
o(d, d + 16). the essential step in the construction of the reduced action is to realize
that the mass parameters can be assembled into a completely antisymmetric three-index
tensor fabc with o(d, d + 16) indices. these parameters serve two roles in the reduced
theory: as the mass parameters dening the scalar potential (109), and also as the
structure constants in the non-abelian gauge group. thus the reduced theory is now
a massive gauged supergravity. by inspecting the reduced action (116), we discover
that usual u-duality transformations, m  m  = mt , f  f  = f , are now
accompanied by
(117)

efdef

abc = a

fabc  f 

db

ec

given a certain set of mass parameters, u-duality transformations will in general map
these to a new collection of modied couplings. in so doing, u-duality maps one reduced
theory to another. thus we can think that while u-duality remains a symmetry of
the full theory, it is spontaneously broken in any given compactication. our u-duality
covariant formalism provides a unied framework in which to investigate the disparate
massive supergravities, appearing in generalized reductions of heterotic string theory.

it is interesting to consider the symmetries identied here in the framework of
ref. [28]. there, proper symmetries are identied as those that act on elds, while
pseudo-symmetries act on both elds and coupling constants. in the present case, from
the point of view of the ten-dimensional heterotic string theory (or its low energy super-
gravity limit), the o(d, d + 16) transformations are proper symmetries. the key point
is that the mass parameters fabc in eq. (117) were identied with nontrivial background
elds in the internal space. however having compactied, one could truncate the reduced
theory to the d-dimensional gauged supergravity for which eq. (116) is the bosonic part
of the action. from the point of view of this truncated theory, the o(d, d + 16) duality
group contains both proper symmetries and pseudo-symmetries since the fabc are now
simply coupling constants. the proper symetries would be the subgroup of transfor-
mations leaving a given set of couplings invariant under the above action (117), while
the pseudo-symmetries act nontrivially. it is in this sense that we mean that in general
u-duality maps one reduced theory to another.

a novel feature in the present case is that the background elds that produce this
spontaneous breaking are topological. that is the corresponding uxes or geometric

29

curvatures on the internal space are not associated with dynamical elds in the theory.
one aspect of the mass parameters, which we have not considered above, is the fact that
they must be quantized. the usual dirac quantization conditions arise for the yang-
mills uxes from the consideration of charged string states moving in such a background.
similarly, the three-form uxes are shown to be quantized by considering strings with
nontrivial winding numbers [32]. finally for compactication on a twisted torus, properly
matching the geometry of the d-torus will require that the metric twists lie in sl(d, z).
given the quantized nature of the mass parameters, it would seem that the u-duality
symmetry is broken down to o(d, d + 16, z). it is natural to conjecture then that these
discrete symmetries are in fact an exact symmetry of the full string theory, just as in
the case of the standard toroidal compactications [29].

here, we are lead to a slight puzzle. quantization conditions seem to break the
o(d, d+16, r) symmetry of the reduced action (116) to o(d, d+16, z). another aspect of
the reduced theory was that a part of the global o(d, d+16, r) symmetry becomes a local
gauge symmetry. thus it would seem that this continuous subgroup of the u-duality
group must also be exact since it corresponds to a constant gauge transformations.
the puzzle is to understand the interplay of these two apparent exact symmetries. we
will argue that in fact these symmetries are distinct symmetries, despite their apparent
common origin in o(d, d + 16, r).

this distinction is most easily understood by examining a concrete example. the
simplest case to consider is a generalized reduction on t 3 with a metric twist. as
described in section 4, one can think of the resulting geometry as an sl(2, z) bre
bundle with a t 2 bre over an s1 base. that is as one moves around the s1, the
t 2 geometry is varying by a real shift of the modular parameter,    + a. having
circumnavigated the circle once, in the simplest case, the total shift is a = 1, allowing the
t 2 bres to be identied by an sl(2, z) transformation. now we note that in the reduced
theory an arbitrary shift of the metric axion, i.e., the t 2 modulus  , is a symmetry. in
the ten-dimensional space, while this shift changes the t 2 geometry locally over a xed
point on the s1, the geometry is in fact invariant if the axion shift is accompanied by a
translation in the s1 direction. that is all possible t 2 geometries can be found in the bre
over some point in the s1, hence a shift of the t 2 modulus along with a corresponding
translation along the s1 must be a symmetry. another point of view would be that in a
standard reduction, a constant translation along the s1 corresponds to a constant u(1)
symmetry transformation, which acts trivially in the reduced theory. in the generalized
reduction considered here, these translations alone are no longer a symmetry because of
the twisted geometry. instead, to produce a symmetry the translation is accompanied
by a shift of the metric axion.
in any event, the global gauge transformation which
produces    + 1 is accompanied by a translation once around the s1. the u-duality
symmetry producing the same shift of  makes no translation in the s1 direction. hence
these two o(d, d + 16) transformations are actually distinct ten-dimensional symmetries.

the nontrivial interplay of the gauge and u-duality symmetries seems to modify the

30

form of the moduli space of these theories. for a standard toroidal compactication of the
heterotic string, the moduli space[26] is so(d, d + 16, z)\so(d, d + 16, r)/(so(d, r) 
so(d + 16, r)). for the generalized axion compactications considered here, it appears
that the moduli space is reduced to (h so(d, d + 16, z))\so(d, d + 16, r)/(so(d, r)
so(d + 16, r)) where h is the group of global gauge transformations. one might have
included the global gauge transforms for the standard compactication, however, their
action is trivial in that case and so they have no eect. note that the additional reduction
of modding out by h aects even the local structure of the moduli space.

here we use the term moduli space loosely, as typically the scalar potential (109)
pushes the scalar moduli to evolve under its inuence. for example, one might choose
to set m ab = ab as initial data, but this conguration typically would not extremize the
potential and thus the scalars would begin to vary. one might observe that naively a
simple solution for moduli that always extremizes the potential is m ab  lab. unfortu-
nately, this is not a physical solution as it corresponds to a vanishing internal metric.
instead the natural vacua of such theories are therefore similar to the linear dilaton
vacua [30]. the natural supersymmetric vacua are typically domain walls in the reduced
theory [1, 2]. one is also led to consider cosmological evolutions in such theories [7].

although it should be obvious, we also mention that the appearance of a nonabelian
gauge symmetry in the generalized reductions is very dierent than the symmetry en-
hancement that arises at special points in the moduli space of the standard toroidal
reduction.
in the latter case, new massless degrees of freedom associated with string
winding modes appear at these special points to enlarge the gauge group. in the gen-
eralized reductions, there are no extra massless elds appearing in the reduced theory.
actually quite the opposite eect should take place. if one examines the detailed form
of the covariant derivatives of the moduli in eqs. (93) and (96), one recognizes that these
axion scalars are actually stuckelberg elds. the same is true in eq. (90) for the metric
axions if one considers uctuations around a xed background metric. the stuckelberg
nature of the axions is also evident from the gauge transformations in eqs. (98100). of
course, this should have been anticipated given that it was the axionic shift symmetry
which was gauged in the generalized reduction. in any event, the associated gauge elds
will in fact become massive, and the original axions are traded for massive longitudinal
modes. so in contrast with the usual enhanced symmetry points where the number
of massless modes increases, the generalized reductions actually produce a reduction
in the number of (strictly) massless degrees of freedom as compared to the standard
compactication.

it should be mentioned, however, that in ref. [20] a unied framework was constructed
to incorporate all of the enhanced symmetry points of the standard toroidal reduction
to four dimensions. the form of the completely duality-invariant low-energy eective
action constructed there is in fact very similar to our action in eq. (116). the similarity
of these two actions for four dimensions is essentially dictated by the fact that they are
both versions of gauged n = 4 supergravity in which the form of the action is completely

31

xed given the gauge group [21]. undoubtedly,
it is also true that supersymmetry
essentially xes the elegant form of our bosonic action (116) in higher dimensions, as
well. in particular, the simple form of the moduli potential (109) is probably a result of
the large number of supersymmetries in the theory.

given the above discussion, a natural question is under what conditions do we expect
the action (116) to give a reasonable description of the low energy degrees of freedom.

in our derivation, we are ignoring3 massive string states with masses ms  1/ =
1/s, kaluza-klein momentum modes with mkk  1/l and string winding modes with
mw  l/2
s, where l is the typical size of the compact dimensions. hence we should
require that any of the masses appearing in our generalized scherk-schwarz reductions
are smaller than these. otherwise, the corresponding massive states should also be
integrated out, or alternatively we could consider the full string theory including all
of the massive states. given the ux and curvature quantization conditions discussed
above, one must be careful in considering this question.

considering each type of the mass contribution individually, we begin with the three-

form uxes. in this case [32], the quantization condition takes the form: r3cycle h  n 2
s
where n is an integer. therefore one nds that the corresponding mass parameters must
s/l3. thus if one is considering a regime where s/l << 1, i.e., the internal
be m n p  2
space is large compared to the string scale, then these masses are much smaller than those
of the massive states listed above. similarly, considering the gauge eld uxes, we have
m n  s/l2. thus in the regime s/l << 1, these gauge ux
masses are smaller than those of the states which have been ignored, however, they are
systematically larger than those generated by the three-form uxes. the latter though
assumes that all of the compact dimensions are essentially the same size.

r2cycle f i  n s and mi

finally we consider the geometric masses for compactication on a twisted torus. in
this case, it is easiest to gain insight by considering the case of t 3 for which some of the
explicit formulae were presented at the beginning of section 4. it is straightforward to
see that in general m
n p  lm /(ln lp ) where lm is the compactication size associated
with ym . therefore if all of the compact dimensions are the same size, these masses will
be of the same order as that of the kaluza-klein modes, and so one is not really justied
in using the action (116) as it stands. by arranging a less democratic compactication,
however, in which lm /ln << 1 for certain directions, one can safely introduce certain
m
n p while keeping only the degrees of freedom appearing in (116).

the preceding analysis assumed that the sizes of the compact directions were xed.
however, as discussed above, this will likely not be the case due to the scalar potential
(109). hence in examining solutions of the equations of motion, one should be aware
that the scalars may evolve to (or from) a regime where the low energy theory described
by (116) is no longer valid.

3more accurately, we should think that these states are integrated out in constructing the eective

theory.

32

we have already noted that in section 4 the explicit form of the internal coordinate
dependence appearing in the basis forms m is not explicitly needed. rather, this depen-
dence is implicitly xed by the internal symmetry algebra given in (61) and (62). the
key for inducing the metric mass parameters was the presence of a nonabelian isometry
group on the internal manifold. thus our formalism includes more general nonabelian
kaluza-klein reductions [5, 33, 34] than the case of twisted tori. in general a reduction
must satisfy the consistency condition that the procedures of dimensional reduction and
variation of the action commute. further one usually wants to construct a reduced the-
ory with a nite number of eld degrees of freedom, which are generally in one-to-one
correspondence with the degrees of freedom of the abelian reductions on internal tori.
as it has been discussed in particular in [34], these two conditions are in fact related. a
sucient condition for nite-dimensional truncations is that the pullbacks of generators
of the isometry algebra on the tangent space span a complete, linearly independent, or-
thogonal basis. the end result is then that the permissible internal manifolds should be
homogeneous spaces with isometry algebra of dimension equal to the dimension of the
manifold on which it acts.

in lower dimensions, the relevant isometry algebras can be completely classied [35].
in two dimensions, the only admissible lie algebras with two generators are the abelian
one and an algebra dened by [z1, z2] = qz2, however the only structure constant of
the latter is 2
12 = q, which violates eq. (64) when q 6= 0. in three-dimensions, the
algebras of interest are given by ve of the nine bianchi model geometries [35]. they
are bianchi i (abelian), the two algebras corresponding to the twisted tori: bianchi ii
(discussed in [19] and in section (4) and bianchi viii (a twisted torus with a cubic
ansatz in internal coordinates) and two non-toroidal algebras: a special bianchi vi with
the h = 1 (which must be chosen to satisfy eq. (64)), and bianchi ix (corresponding to
a group manifold of so(3)  su(2)/z2 or its universal covering space su(2)  s3, and
with the su(2) algebra). the latter two algebras give rise to the reduced theories of the
same form as (116). the 3-sphere with antipodal identication su(2)/z2 has nontrivial
1-cycles, and wilson loops could still be present, breaking the vector supermultiplet
gauge group to u(1)16. hence it appears to be covered by our consideration, at least
in the supergravity limit.
in fact reductions of the n = 1d = 10 supergravity on
s3  s3 have been considered [36], and in this case because of the absence of the vector
supermultiplet, the global topology on the sphere did not play a role. nevertheless
the complete understanding of the case of s3, and higher-dimensional simply connected
manifolds in heterotic string theory would require a more detailed scrutiny of the gauge
sector. in addition, since the internal subalgebra is semisimple, the sizes of the internal
radii would have to be equal, giving all the geometric masses m
n p of the order of 1/l.
thus as indicated in the discussion above, we can not use the action (116) as it stands
to consistently study the dynamics of the low energy theory. one must either extend
it to include other massive kaluza-klein states, which have been integrated out in our
construction, or exclude the modes appearing in our action with masses of the order of
1/l. in any event, this case therefore requires further scrutiny.

33

in closing, we underline that the scherk-schwarz reduction [5] may be viewed as
an application of the nonabelian kaluza-klein reduction [33, 34] on a group which ad-
mits nite-dimensional truncations to supergravity theories. as discussed by scherk
and schwarz in their work [5], their main motivation was seeking ways to break su-
persymmetry. actually, this approach to supersymmetry breaking is really similar to
supersymmetry breaking in various p-brane congurations, with the only additional re-
quirement that the p-brane solutions admit a simply transitive isometry group in spatial
directions. such solutions can be interpreted as spontaneous compactication, such as
the freund-rubin solutions [27] (which happen not to break any supersymmetry, since
they correspond to spontaneous compactications to ads4  s7 spacetime, but their
extensions [37] may do so). note that the original terminology of scherk and schwarz [5]
distinguished between the so-called internal and external axionic symmetries. the for-
mer were associated with the axions that emerge from the metric of the internal manifold,
while the latter come from the form-eld sector. however, in light of our interpretation
of the o(d, d + 16) dualities as the maps between the internal and external masses, it
is clear that this distinction between the internal and external symmetries is somewhat
articial in string theory.

moreover, the physically meaningful properties of the reduced theory, given by the
masses and the structure constants, depend on the directions and types of elds which
are excited on the internal space.
in general, the internal elds can be turned on by
using the tensor representations of isometries. in this context, a very natural question
to ask is what is the most general set of admissible structure constants fabc which arise
from the scherk-schwarz reduction? it is obvious from our discussion that the answer
is equivalent to classifying all inequivalent isometry groups which may act on a compact
manifold of dimension d.
in other words, this means that to determine all massive
supergravities which come from the scherk-schwarz dimensional reduction, one should
nd all inequivalent internal axionic groups, and using them deduce the external groups,
which satisfy the jacobi consistency conditions. the mass terms are related by duality
symmetry. if the reductions are performed over group spaces without nontrivial 1-cycles,
or if the wilson loops in the yang-mills sector vanish in their own right, the original
yang-mills gauge symmetry remains unbroken. hence, the full nonabelian structure of
the vector supermultiplet elds should be considered. it may be interesting to consider
the relationship of duality and lie algebras of the yang-mills sector and the internal
manifold in this case. one may further ask if there may be massive supergravities
which cannot be obtained by scherk-schwarz reductions, but could be dual to them,
in a manner which we have discussed here. other interesting questions which may be
asked in this context are what happens in type i and ii superstring theories. these tasks
are beyond the scope of the present article, but clearly merit further investigation. it
therefore appears appropriate to end our discussion here on this note, and leave these
questions for future work.

a reduction of curvature and dilaton

here we give the main formulas for the dimensional reduction of the metric-dilaton sector
of the action (3). the metric-dilaton part is given in eq. (88), which we repeat here:

sg = z d10xgenr(g) + ()2o

(118)

the reduction ansatz for the metric is as in eq. (72)

ds2 = g(x)dxdx + gm n (x)(m (y) + v m

(x)dx)(n (y) + v n

(x)dx)

(119)

wherefore we see that we can dene the torsion-free tangent space basis according to
ea = {e,e a}, where

e = e
e a = e a

(120)

b  eb = 0, and the metric compatibility
using (120), the torsion-free condition dea + a
condition ab = ba, where the indices are raised and lowered with the at-space metric
ab = (, ab), we can determine the spin connexion. recalling that the non-zero
structure constants imply dm = m

hence the ansatz for the reduction of the metric (119) ensures that the reduced quantities
are automatically gauge-covariant, as intended. next, we can use the form-notation for
the einstein-hilbert lagrangian to simplify the algebra of the reduction of the action.
we have in general

(126)

now, these formulas give useful calculational shortcuts. by the structure of the indices
in the -tensor of the rst expression, one can readily see that the factor ea1  ... 
ead+d2 must contain all d-beins e. as a result, only the those terms in r which are
independent of e a contribute to j1. since

b reduction of yang-mills fields

here we outline the dimensional reduction of the yang-mills gauge elds. we recall the
ten-dimensional action in eq. (91)

scy m = 

1

4 z d10xgef i

f i

(135)

37

to proceed, we need to determine the ansatze for the reduction of the vector elds ai.
as we discussed in section 3, eqs. (5) and (19) comprise the ansatz for the case of at
internal torus. the ensuing mass terms mi
m n already aect the gauge algebra, which
becomes manifest when one considers the eect of kaluza-klein gauge transformations
on the yang-mills elds, and the axions which arise from reducing these elds. for the
scalar axion eld, we had from (38)

ai

m = ai

m + 2mi

m n n

(136)

the inhomogeneous term selects ai
m as one of the axions of the theory. this must
remain true even when the internal space is not at, after appropriate generalizations
of the gauge transformations are made, to account for m
n p . this leads to the following
ansatz for the yang-mills vector elds:

ai = ai

(x)dx + ai

m (x)m + i(y)

(137)

where the forms i are to be dened below. let us discuss this ansatz. first, it ensures
the correct transformation rules for ai
m (x) after the reduction, so that it retains its role
as the axion of the reduced theory. an alternative possibility, to which one might be
tempted to resort, would have been to reduce the gauge eld ai such that the cross-term
were ai
m  m , where  m were the invariant one-forms dened in (71). however, by the
invariance of  m under kaluza-klein gauge transformations, this would have implied
that the reduced quantity ai
m would have been gauge singlets, and hence would not
have transformed as given in (136) in the limit m
n p = 0. on the other hand, (137)
correctly produces (136) when m
n p  0. thus, the only possibility for reduction which
could reduce to the correct limit m

n p as dened in (136) is (137).

the elds i generalize the terms mi

m n yn in (19) to the case of a general internal
space. they encode the information about the gauge eld uxes on internal two-cycles.
this means, that if we consider the components of the gauge eld strengths f i in the
m n  mi
internal space, we should expect to nd f i
m n in the basis spanned by m s.
note that these elds can only be dened locally, and not globally. this is because we
see that the mass terms must emerge as mi
m n m  n  di. further, the mass terms
must be harmonic forms by the projections of the gauge eld equations of motion in
the internal space: df i = 0, d f i  0 (where for simplicity we ignore the dilaton-
dependent terms in the latter equation). clearly, if mass terms were exact forms, as
suggested by the derivation from  di, they would solve the equations of motion, but
would have vanishing internal uxes: r2cycle f i = 0. hence i must be dened only
locally, with nontrivial transition functions between dierent charts on the internal space.
this of course merely generalizes the considerations involved in the construction of the
dirac monopole. however, this implies that the eld ai is also dened only locally,
but in such a way that the perturbations around some background value are globally
well-dened. since the reduced elds are nothing else but such perturbations, they are
well-dened in the reduced theory.

38

to determine the explicit form of i when m

n p 6= 0, we need to require that the
gauge eld strength evaluated from (137) has nonzero internal ux contributions. since
f i = dai, we nd
f i = [ai

]dx  dx + ai

n p n  p + di

m dx  m  ai

m m

(138)

this must coincide with

f i = [ai

]dx  dx + ai

m dx  m  (mi

bc + ai

m m

n p )n  p

leading to

(139)

(140)

di = mi

m n m  n

this coincides with (22) in the limit m
n p are constants which
are antisymmetric in the lower two indices, and in the limit m
n p = 0 they become
identical with the axionic yang-mills masses discussed in sec. (3). the integrability
condition for (140), which is found by looking at

n p = 0. the quantities mi

0 = d2i = 2mi

m n n

p qm  q  p

(141)

where we have used (62), is more important, and is completely general. it comes from
demanding that the eld strength is independent of yn . this leads to

mi

m n n

p q + mi

p n n

qm + mi

qn n

m p = 0

(142)

which will be interpreted as nothing else but one of the jacobi identities for the structure
constants of the reduced theory. hence the information about the reduced nonabelian
gauge symmetry is in fact encoded in the reduction ansatz, as a consistency condition
between the various modes that are excited on the internal space. comparing (137)
with the ansatz for ai(x, y) in (19) shows that they coincide when m
n p = 0, while
the constraint (142) disappears. hence indeed (137) and the solution of (140) together
comprise the reduction ansatz for the yang-mills gauge elds.

with this ansatz, we can now reduce the action (135). we can reexpress the eld

strength (139) in terms of the tangent space basis (120) as

c reduction of two-form

the reduction of the kalb-ramond two-form b contributions is done in a fashion similar
to the reduction of the yang-mills gauge elds, except for the complications that are
caused by the more involved tensor structure of h eld, and the anomalous gauge trans-
formation properties of b, which require the inclusion of the yang-mills chern-simons
terms in the denition of h. the kalb-ramond action is

sn s = 

1

12 z d10xgehh

(147)

we can always write b in the form given in (5), but need to determine the proper ansatz
for the ym dependence such that the components of b produce internal uxes of the
three-form eld strength. further, we must ensure that when the limit m
n p = 0 is
taken, the ansatz correctly produces the gauge transformation properties given in (37)
and (38). we can start in much the same way as we did previously, when we considered
the yang-mills uxes. first, we dene the two-form potential

b = b +

1
2

 +

1

 + 

(148)

where the two-form b is independent of ym , and hence can be viewed simply as a
globally-dened perturbation around the dirac-type conguration of b producing an
internal ux. this is encoded in the forms ,  and , which all depend on the internal
coordinates. to dene these forms, we recall that there are yang-mills chern-simons
terms in the denition of the eld strength h: h = d b  1
2ai  f i (4). in terms of the
potential and eld strength for the yang-mills elds (137) and (139) from the previous
section, we nd

(149)

in this expression, there is several terms which depend explicitly on the internal space
coordinates ym . however to be able to dimensionally reduce the theory, we must require
that the three-form eld strength must be ym -independent. hence the ym -dependent
terms in db and af terms must cancel against each other, leaving only ym -independent
contributions in the components of h expressed in the covariant basis m (or the tangent
basis (120), which is the equivalent and perhaps more usual statement).

for this purpose, we dene the forms

 = ai

m m  i

 = ai

dxi

(150)

with this, we can after some algebra write down the expression for the three-form eld
strength h as

and in this equation, only the last two terms contain explicit ym dependence. this depen-
dence however is now quite nontrivial. namely, we can consider the exterior derivative
of these two terms. we nd

on the other hand, we the three-form eld strength h must have components in the
internal space which are independent of the internal space coordinates. given the ex-

3m n p m

qrq  r  n  p , comparing the sides of the equation we get

(154)

this is the last of the independent classes of jacobi identities of the reduced theory.

41

hence regardless of the specics of the ansatz, that depends on the symmetry of the

d gauge algebra

here we give a detailed derivation of the gauge algebra (104). our approach is to rst
compute the gauge-dependent variations of the reduced gauge elds under the gauge
transformations, and then to reassemble them into the algebra using the homomorphism
between the neighbourhood of identity of the gauge group and the gauge algebra. we
will work in the ascending order of complexity. thus, we start with the reduced form of
the gauge transformations associated with the kalb-ramond two-form eld.

recall that the two-form eld introduces a one-form gauge symmetry in the original
ten-dimensional theory, b  b = b + d, where  = m m + dx is a one-form.
hence, upon dimensional reduction to d dimensions, we nd d new u(1) gauge sym-
metries, counted by the components of  in the internal space. of course, there still
remains the reduced one-form of the original gauge transformation  = dx, which
produces variations of the reduced eld b = 1
2bdxdx. these transformations must
allow the reduced elds of the theory, which emerge from the two-form, to retain their
ym -independent form, in order that the reduction is consistent. hence all such reduced
gauge transformations must be independent of ym as well. the physical meaning of
this statement can be seen as follows: from the point of view of the reduced theory, the
modes which are excited in the internal dimensions (i.e., they depend on ym ) are all very
heavy, and hence cannot be excited by the low energy physics, which is described by the
eective action in d dimensions. so from this and the reduction ansatz for the two-form,
we see that the only elds which transform nontrivially under the gauge transformations
generated by m are the reduced components b, bm and bm n . an explicit com-
putation shows that (where we set the reduced two-form gauge transformation to zero,
 = 0)

b
m n = bm n  2p p
b
m = bm + m
b
 = b

m n

(160)

using eld redenitions (7) which diagonalize the reduced gauge transformations, we can
rewrite the previous equation as

m n = bm n  2p p

a = ba + m  2p p

it is clear that these are the only nontrivial gauge transformations rules in the case
of gauge symmetries arising from the two-form sector. note that the b transforms
nontrivially, which is a signature of the anomaly that emerges from the reduction.

next, we turn to the reduction of the yang-mills subalgebra of the original ten-
dimensional gauge group. in the ten-dimensional case, these symmetries correspond to
ai  ai = ai + di. if we wish to preserve the reduction ansatz, and the fact that the
reduced eld strengths are independent of ym , again we must require that the residual
gauge symmetries after dimensional reduction are independent of ym . in the yang-mills
sector after the reduction, and diagonalization of the reduced degrees of freedom using
(7), it is easy to see that

ai

m = ai

m

ai

 + i

(162)

these transformations obviously leave the kaluza-klein sector unchanged. however,
they induce nontrivial transformation properties in the two-form sector. to start with,
due to the anomaly, the two-form eld in ten-dimensions transforms according to b =
b + 1
2if i + d. if we consider the decomposition of b in terms of the reduced degrees
of freedom, we see that in addition to the b terms, also the terms proportional to ai

are gauge-noninvariant. hence we must have the following transformation rule for the
combination of these elds:

finally, we consider the reduction of the kaluza-klein gauge transformations. they
have the most complicated structure, since they aect the matter degrees of freedom
from all three sectors. we start with the metric moduli gm n and the gauge elds v m
.
in fact, we have already determined how these elds transform; the results are given in
(73) and (74)

from the transformation rule for the moduli matrix gm n , we see that it is a direct
product of scalars belonging to the singlet and two adjoints (with charge 1) of the
isometry group. this is precisely the transformation rule of the axions hidden in gm n .
they can be explicitly found by gauss decomposition of the matrix e a
m (with the
property that gm n = abe a
n ) and identifying the pivots with the dilaton-like
elds and the upper triangular matrix elements with the axions  see, e.g., eq. (77).

me b

next we consider the eect of kaluza-klein gauge transformations on yang-mills
gauge elds. from (79), it is clear that the reduced elds transform nontrivially under
the kaluza-klein transformations. a lengthy but straightforward calculation shows that
due to the form of the compensator forms i, we nd

i = i + 2mi

m n m n + d 

(169)

hence if we accompany the kaluza-klein gauge transformation by a yang-mills custodian
transformation

finally we come to consider the transformation properties of the two-form degrees of
freedom. first, we recall the notation of (148), b = b + 1
2 + , and the denition
(150). note that  +  = ai  i. now we use an algebraic trick to compute the gauge
dependence of the compensator forms . instead of working with  itself, we consider
its exterior derivative. using the fact that

mation (170), which induces b = 1

we should mention again here that the role of the custodian transformations, as well
as the anomaly, is essential to ensure the cancellation of the ym -dependent terms in
the gauge transformation laws. this is precisely what will eventually produce the non-
abelian symmetry structure among the reduced vector elds. choosing the b eld gauge
transformation according to  =   1

we are now nally ready to reassemble the results of this appendix into the algebra

merely describe the method here and list the results. first, we recapitulate the explicit

(185)

we can now calculate the algebra of gauge generators. as in section 3, the group
generators are denoted ta, where the indices take values in the space of { m , m , i}, with
dimension 2d + 16, and in the explicit form arise from the three sectors described above:
ta = (zm , x m , y i). the gauge algebra must close, and hence it satises

[ta, tb] = ifab

ctc

(186)

c are the structure constants which we need to determine. we can compute
where fab
them by considering the products of transformations (183)-(185), which are in general
of the form h1  g1  h  g, with h and g any two innitesimal gauge transformations.
innitesimally, for any two operators a, b and a number  << 1, we have eabea =
b + [a, b] + o(2). so using g = exp(ia
2ta), where a =

1ta) and h = exp(ia

48

(m , m , i) are the gauge transformation parameters dened above, we have, to linear
order in a
1,

g1  h  g = h  ia

1 [ta, h]

and hence we nd, to the lowest nontrivial order (quadratic)

h1  g1  h  g = 1 + a

1 b

2[ta, tb] = 1 + ifab

(187)

(188)

c a

1 b

2tc .

hence substituting the explicit form of the gauge transformations (183)-(185), we can
calculate the structure constants. to do it, we must project the algebra composition laws
on the set of basis states of our irreducible lorentz representations, i.e., we will compute
h1  g1  h g|i. at rst glance, it may be tempting to apply gauge transformations to
scalar elds, because these are simpler. however, while the scalars transform nontrivially,
in general they do not span a faithful representation of the gauge group. thus we evaluate
h1  g1  h  g|i on the set of basis states dened by the vector elds, because they do
span a faithful representation of the gauge group. clearly, we should consider terms of
the form [x, x], [y, y ], [z, z], [x, y ], [x, z] and [y, z]. the explicit computation, which
can be carried out straightforwardly using the formulas above, produces the structure
constants. they are

f m

n p = fn p

m = 2m
n p

f i

m n = fm n

i = 2mi

m n

fm n p = 3m n p (189)

with this, we can nally write down the explicit form of the reduced gauge algebra:

[x m , x n ] = [y i, y j ] = [x m , y i] = 0
[x m , zn ] = 2im
[zm , zn ] = 3im n p x p + 2imi

n p x p

e generalized axion reductions of ref. [6]

above, we noted that the ansatz (19) is linear in the internal coordinates despite the
explicit presence of the axionic potentials in the action, and not just their derivatives.
naively, this may seem to contradict our discussion of ref. [6]. there, we considered
a similar situation, where the explicit appearance of undierentiated axion potentials
required that to generate all the axion masses one had to introduce an ansatz where
the dependence on the internal space coordinates was of order higher than linear. we
explicitly considered a case in which the reduction ansatz was quadratic in internal
coordinates. however, we also pointed out that these quadratic terms could be removed
by a suitable eld redenition. to clarify the situation, let us re-examine that case
here. there were three scalar axions a1,a2 and a3 appearing as o-diagonal metric
components4 in a reduction on t 3. the corresponding eld strengths, which naturally
, a2 = a(23)

4the elds in ref. [6] and above in eq. (77) correspond to those here as follows: a1 = a(12)

and a3 = a(13)

.

49

appeared in the dimensional reduction, were

f1 = da1

f2 = da2

f3 = da3  a2da1

(191)

as we have showed in [6], the ansatz which simultaneously induces all three possible
mass terms is

a1(x, y) = a1(x) + m1y
a2(x, y) = a2(x) + m2y
a3(x, y) = a3(x) + m3y + m2ya1(x) +

m1m2y2

(192)

a direct substitution of (192) into (191) shows that the eld strengths do not depend on
the coordinate y.

however, it is easy to see that replacing the axion a3 by

redenes its eld strength to

a3 = a3 +

and also completely removes the terms of order of y2 in the reduction ansatz. indeed,
the last formula in (192) is replaced by

a3(x, y) = a3(x) + m3y +

note that the (anti)symmetric form of the chern-simons contribution to f3 in (194)
closely resembles that in the three-form eld strength (17), in the case of interest in
the present paper. this seems to be the essential ingredient in the linearization of the
reduction ansatz. note that the democratic form of the revised ansatz (195) is also
similar to that for bm n in eq. (19).

the meaning of the disappearance of the o(y2) terms can be deduced as follows:

the quadratic ansatz (192) can be rewritten in the matrix form [6] as5

a2(x, y)

5these matrices correspond to the dreibein of the internal torus [6], where we have set to zero the
dilatonic elds that determine the scale of the internal dimensions. alternatively, the latter can be
factored out as in eq. (77). the elds of eq. (19) however all come from the p-forms of the theory.
nevertheless the reduction algorithms are closely related.

(198)
now, we recall a version of the baker-campbell-hausdor formula, which allows us
to evaluate products of exponentials of matrices. namely, for as long as [a, [a, b]] =
[b, [a, b]] = 0 for any two matrices a, b we have exp(a) exp(yb) = exp(a + yb +
1
2 y[a, b]). in our case,

a =

[a, b] =

(199)

and hence using the baker-campbell-hausdor formula we nd, upon the substitution
into (198) and taking the logarithm of both sides, we nd

(200)
which is precisely the linear reduction ansatz. hence, we see that the o(y2) disappeared
essentially by making the eld redenition which amounts to taking a functional log-
arithm of the axionic degrees of freedom. nevertheless, we note that in general this
procedure of linearization may turn out to be quite awkward.
