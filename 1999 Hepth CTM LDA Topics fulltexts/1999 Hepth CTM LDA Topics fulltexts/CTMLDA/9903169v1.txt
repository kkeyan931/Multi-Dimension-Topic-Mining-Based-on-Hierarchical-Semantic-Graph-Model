1 introduction

recently, there was a lot of interest to string theories on ads, and on other manifolds
with boundaries, [1]-[5] and to their relationship to yang mills quantum eld theories
on the boundary. string theory on ads has a symmetry group, corresponding to
isometries of target space, whose bosonic part is so(1, n). there should be conserved
noether currents corresponding to such symmetries. also, such string theories should
be described by conformal eld theories. usually, when there are conserved currents
in a conformal eld theory, those currents give rise to a kac-moody algebra, the space
of states in such conformal theory are in highest weight modules of the kac moody
algebra, and the virasoro algebra comes via sugawara construction [6].

algebra so(1, n) is a real form of a complex algebra; still it can be promoted to a
loop algebra in the usual way; it is generated by ei  p (s), with ei  so(1, n), p (s)
laurent polynomials, and the bracket [ei  p (s), ej  g(s)] = [ei, ej]  p (s)g(s) +
k (ei, ej) res dp
ds q where (ei, ej) is an invariant symmetric form on so(1, n); this form
is not positive-denite. highest weight module for such loop algebra is not unitary.
if we think about boundary states, there are two possible candidates for repre-
sentations: one non-unitary highest weight, and another unitary, not highest weight.
the purpose of this note is to examine the second candidate, using whatever is natural
from representation theory

we do not put any supersymmetry here, since its simpler, and we have to get rid
of supersymmetry in the end of the day anyway; as we are dealing with just a repre-
sentation theory, not with a full string theory, it causes no problems to concentrate
on the bosonic sector. we do not have here a central extension of the current algebra
(see [2], [3] for a relevant discussion in supersymmetric case).

2 unitary irreducible representation of dso(1, n) loop

algebra and unitary action of operators in uni-
versal enveloping algebra

2.1 hilbert space

the loop algebra cso(1, n) has an interesting unitary, non-highest weight irreducible
2 = 1 with integral zero, z (x)dx = 0, and with the scalar product

representation, which we believe is important and which we describe below. consider
2 + . . . +
the hilbert space h of real valued functions (x) on a sphere sn: x1
xn

2 + x2

h, i =z z (x)(x ) ln (1  (x, x )) dxdx 

(1)

2

we can introduce the hilbert space h for maps (x, s) from s1 into h, with the scalar
product

<(), ()> =is 1

dsz z (x, s)(x , s) ln (1  (x, x )) dxdx 

we introduce bosonic fock space f of symmetric tensor products f =lm hm, which

is also a hilbert space; its enough to give scalar product

h()m , ()mi = m! h() , ()im

(2)

it is easy to compute other scalar products in fock space of symmetric tensor powers
of h, for example

1

(m2)! 1  2  (m2),

< 1
(m2)! ( <1, 1> <2, > + <2, 1> <1, > ) <, > m2+
+ 1

(m3)! ( <1, > <2, > <, 1> ) <, > m3

1

(m1)! 1  (m1)> =

we also introduce exp(()) in a completion of f,

exp((x(s)) = 1 +

xm=1

1
m!

(x(s))m

hexp(()), exp(())i = exp (h(), ()i)

(3)

2.2 unitary irreducible representation of loop algebra cso(1, n)

via rst order dierential operators acting on exp h

we consider maps s1  g from a circle into the lie algebra so(1, n), with the point-
wise lie bracket,

{i1, i2} (s) = {i1(s), i2(s)}

(5)

this lie algebra cso(1, n) is given by generators and relations

{iij(f (s)), ikl(g(s))} = jkiil(f g(s))  jliik(f g(s)) + ilijk(f g(s))  ikijl(f g(s))

{iij(f (s)), ik,0(g(s))} = jkii,0(f g(s))  ikij,0(f g(s))

{ii,0(f (s)), ij,0(g(s))} = ii,j(f g(s))

a unitary irreducible representation is given by

(6)

t [i(f (s))]exp ((x(s))) = (d[i] + [i]  < [i], (x, s) > ) exp ((x(s))) (7)

3

where d is a derivation, which satisfy leibnits rule, and are skew-adjoint operators
in h:

d[iij(f (s))] (x(s)) = f (s) (xij  xji)) (x, s),

d[ii,0(f (s))] (x(s)) = f (s) (i  xi(x)  (n  1)xi) (x, s),

d[ii,0(f (s))] 1 = 0,

and

[iij(f (s))] = 0

[ii,0(f (s))] = (n  1)f (s)i(x),

(8)

(9)

where i(x) is a function on a sphere equal to the i-th coordinate, i(x) = xi.

 is a one-cocycle,

d[i1][i2]  d[i2][i2] = [ {i1, i2} ]

(10)

it is easy to verify directly that the operators of the representation are skew

adjoint. it can be shown that the representation is irreducible.

2.3 unitary action of universal enveloping algebra in

(f exp h)

it is easy to check, that if we want to represent elements of universal enveloping
algebra by dierential operators acting on our hilbert space of functions, we are
forced to have that t [i1i2] cannot be equal to just t [i1]t [i2], since the right hand
side doesnot satisfy the commutation relations of our lie algebra, and also we are
loosing skew-adjoint property for t [i1] in the right hand side. as some computatioon
shows, it is possible to correct both problems at once, as we show below.

we will write explicitly polynomials of degree up to 3:
in degree 2, skew-symmetry means that

< exp(()) , t [ i1(f (s)) i2(g(s)) ] exp(())> =

 < t [i1(f (s))] exp(()) , t [i2(g(s))] exp((x, s))> ,

and the relations are

(t [i1(f (s)) i2(g(s))]  t [i2(g(s)) i1(f (s))] ) exp((x, s)) =
t [ {i1(f (s)), i2(g(s))} ] exp((x, s))

(11)

(12)

4

from this we can deduce how to write a second degree dierential operator, rep-

resenting polynomials of degree 2 in genrators of lie algebra by unitary operators:

t [i1(f (s)) i2(g(s))] exp((x, s)) =

=(cid:16) (d[i1] + [i1]  < [i1], () > ) (d[i2] + [i2]  < [i2], () > ) 
 < [i1], (d[i2])() + [i2] > (cid:17)exp((x, s)) =
=(cid:16)t [i1(f (s))] t [i2(g(s))]  < [i1(f )], (d[i2(g)])() + [i2(g)] > (cid:17)

exp((x, s))

(13)

notice that there is an additional term in the right hand side , which is needed to
ensure unitarity.

in degree 3, the dierential polynomial is:

t [i1(f (s)) i2(g(s)) i3(h(s))]exp((x, s)) =

 (cid:16) (d[i1] + [i1]  < [i1], () > )
 < [i2], (d[i3])() + [i3] > (cid:17)
 < [i1], (d[i2]d[i3])() > !

exp((x, s)) =

(d[i2] + [i2]  < [i2], () > ) (d[i3] + [i3]  < [i3], () > )

 < [i1], (d[i3])() + [i3] > (d[i2] + [i2]  < [i2], () > )
 < [i1], (d[i2])() + [i2] > (d[i3] + [i3]  < [i3], () > )

(14)

t [i1(f (s))] t [i2(g(s)) i3(h(s))]

 < [i1(f )], (d[i3(h)])() + [i3(h)] > t [i2(g)]
 < [i1(f )], (d[i2(g)])() + [i2(g)] > t [i3(h)]

=(cid:16)
 < [i1(f )], (d[i2(g)]d[i3(h)])() > (cid:17)

exp((x, s))

higher degree polynomials are constructed in a similar fashion.

the rule.

we associate to each i[f (s)] in universal enveloping algebra a dierential operator

on representation space

d[i[f (s)]] + [i[f (s)]]  <[i[f (s)]], ..

where <[i[f (s)]], .. acts on the right, on terms in h in the symmetric tensor powers
symh., by forming scalar products with those terms in all possible ways.

exp((x, s)) =

= 2(cid:16) < [ij,0(f g), > t [ii,0(f )]  < [ii,0(f g), > t [ij,0(f )]
+ < [ij,0(f g), > < [ii,0(f ), >  < [ii,0(f g), > < [ij,0(f ), > (cid:17)

exp((x, s));

also,

[l(f (s)), ii,0(g)]

t [
exp((x, s)) =

exp((x, s))

2.4 virasoro algebra, or how to make sugawara construction

work

sugawara construction is known for heighest-weight current algebra modules. our
module, constructed above, is not the heighest or lowest weight module, which makes

6

sugawara construction of virasoro algebra dicult, and in fact the answer depends on
exact prescribtion to perform a summation; namely, (the complex-valued) operators

ii,0(eiks) ii,0(ei(k+m)s)],

t [xk xi<j

iij(eiks) iij(ei(k+m)s) xi
(d + )[iij(f (s))] (d + )[iij(g(s)) xi

tor,xi<j

with m 6= 0, acts on symbols exp; since the main dierential symbol of such opera-
(d + )[ii,0(f (s))] (d + )[ii,0(g(s))]

is zero, no divergencies appear; however, commutation relations for such operators
are not those of virasoro algebra, since, unlike actions on heighest weight modules,
change of summation variable, usually performed in proving commutation relations
no longer works (the fact that commutators of such are not that of virasoro algebra
should be obvious by looking at commutators of operator l(f (s)) computed above).
we still want to have an action of virasoro algebra to have any hope for a confor-
mal eld theory; and for that we have to modify summation prescription: operators

lm(s)(n,) = 

+

k< m

2xn xi<j

1

nxk m
2 xi<j

qa
iij(ei(k+m)(s+)) iij(eik(s)) xi

iij(eik(s)) iij(ei(k+m)(s+)) xi

ii,0(ei(k+m)(s+)) ii,0(eik(s))

(19)

ii,0(eik(s)) ii,0(ei(k+m)(s+))+

where qa = 2(n + 1).

t [ [lm(s)(n,), iab(eips)] ]exp = pt [iab(ei(m+p)s)](1 + o()) exp + o(e2n ) exp
(20)

and

lim
0

lim
n

for almost all .

similarly,

t [ [lm(s)(n,), iab(eips)] ]exp = pt [iab(ei(m+p)s)] exp

(21)

lim
0

lim
n

t [ [lm(s)(n,), ln(s)(n,)] ]exp = (m  n)t [lm+n(s)] exp

(22)

for almost all .

3 conclusions

we believe unitary, non highest weight representations will play a role in describing
boundary states in ads-type constructions. however, nothing is known about con-
formal eld theories, belavin-polyakov-zamolodchikov style, with non-highest weight

7

states for currents; even getting virasoro algebra is very painful and requires careful
regularization of sums. we hope to return to the subject of unitary, non-highest
weight conformal eld theories in the future.
