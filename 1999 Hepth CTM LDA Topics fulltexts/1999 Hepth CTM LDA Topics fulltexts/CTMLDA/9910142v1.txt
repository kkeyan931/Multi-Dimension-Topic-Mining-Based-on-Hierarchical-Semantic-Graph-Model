i. introduction

this talk is devoted to the use of the physical variables in the fashion of dirac [1] to the
chern-simons (cs) theories in 2+1 dimensions with reinterpretations of our previous results
[2]. in order to give motivations of our work, it would be better to introduce the cs theories
[3] to this audience rst.

the (pure) cs lagrangian is dened by

lcs =


2

aa,

(1)

where 012 = 1, g=diag(1,1,1). but this theory is not so interesting in the aspect of the
physical variables which are gauge invariant because there is no non-vanishing gauge invariant
variable according to the equations of motion, f = 0; only the pure-gauge variables are
remained. because of this problem, let us now consider the cs theories with matter couplings.
here, we only consider the coupling to the charged (complex) scalar elds for simplicity (the
coupling with fermion elds is not dierent much) [4, 5, 6]:

l =


2

aa + (d)(d)  m2,

(2)

where d =  + ia. then, l is invariant up to the total divergence under the gauge
transformations

  ei, a  a + .

the equations of motion are given by


2

f = j 

(3)

(4)

with the conserved current j  = i[(d)d]; in the component form they are expressed
by

b = j 0,
ek = kij i

(5)

(6)

with the (scalar) magnetic and electric elds, b = 1
2ijfij, ek = f k0, respectively. here,
now one can nd the non-vanishing gauge invariant variables and hence this theory is more
interesting in the aspect of the physical variables. moreover, the integral form of the constraint
(5), which is given by

 = z b d2x =

1


q,

2

(7)

implies that when there is a particle with charge q, it carries the magnetic ux  = 1
 q. in
this sense, the cs theory realizes the wilczeks charge-ux composite [7] and this is a role of
the cs eld to the matters in the particle picture [8]. its (quantum) eld theoretical analysis
was rst given by hagen in the coulomb gauge, i.e.,   a = 0 [4]. the (formal) solution of
gauge elds a which solves the constraints (5), (6) are given by

ai(x, t) =

a0(x, t) =

1

2 z d2y ij
2 z d2y ij

1

(x  y)j
|x  y|2 j 0(y, t),
(x  y)j
|x  y|2 j i(y, t).

in this solution, we obtain rst of all the following commutation relations,

[q, (x, t)] = (x, t),
1


[b(y, t), (x, t)] =

2(x  y)(y, t),

(8)

(9)

(10)

where q = r j 0d2x = ir d2x (). these represent that eld (x) carries the unit charge
and delta-function magnetic eld, 1
 2(xy) at x point; these describe the charge-ux composite
in the context of quantum eld theory. moreover,
if we consider the angular momentum
generator which is constructed from the symmetric gauge invariant energy-momentum tensor,
we can nd there is unconventional term in addition to the expected orbital angular momentum
part:

m 12 = z d2x ijxit 0j

= z d2x ijxi(dj + c.c)
= z d2x (x   + c.c.) +

= jorb +

2 z d2x z d2y j 0(x)

x  (x  y)
|x  y|2 j 0(y)

(11)

the rst term is the usual orbital angular momentum part. the second term is an unconven-
tional term which can not be removed by a redenition of the angular momentum generator
because this anomalous term is uniquely governed by [m 01, m 02] = im 12 in the poincare al-
gebra [4, 9]. now, it is easy to nd that the rst and second terms produce the following
transformation for :

[m 12, ] = ix   +

q.

(12)

here, the rst term shows the orbital angular momentum and the second one shows the (anoma-
lous) spin for scalar elds which is a very surprising result. [this unconventional transformation

3

is usually called as the rotational anomaly but here the use of word anomaly is not usual one
because the anomaly exists even at the classical label in our case.] this is the rst non-trivial
result in the theory which was given rst by hagen [4, 9]. in addition to this, several authors
considered furthermore the so-called anyonic [here, anyon means the object which interpolates
between boson and fermion] commutation relation inspired by the works of polyakov [5] and
semeno [6]: in the semenos work, for example, he introduced the composite operators like
as

(x) := exp(cid:20) i
(x) := exp(cid:20)

2 z d2y (x  y)j 0(y)(cid:21) (x),
2 z d2y (x  y)j 0(y)(cid:21) (x)

i

and he found that their commutation relations are given by

(x) (y)  e i

2 (y) (x) = 0,

(13)

(14)

(x)(y)  e
(x)(y)  e

i

2 (y)(x) = 0,
2 (y) (x) = i2(x  y),

i

where, (x  y) is the angle between the vector x  y and the x1-axis and  := (x  y) 
(y  x) = (mod 2). so, depending on the value of the cs coupling constant , the com-
posite operators can represent the fermions ( 
2 6= )as well as
bosons ( 
2 = 0). these are all stories about the cs theories in the canonical quantization
with the coulomb gauge. now, our question is

2 = ) or generally anyons ( 

what is the physical (gauge independent) eect and what is the unphysical (gauge artifact)

one ?

ii. gauge invariant formulation

in order to shed some light to the (gauge artifact) problem, let us consider the diracs

physical variables instead of gauge varying base elds , ,    , etc. [1, 2]

(x) := (x)eiw , (x) := (x)eiw , a(x) := a(x)  w,

(15)

and their complex conjugates with w = r d2z ck(x, z)ak(z). these are gauge invariant for each

dirac dressing function ck(x, z) under the gauge transformation (3) if the dressing function
satises

z ck(x, z) = 2(x  z).
k

(16)

then, it is easy to nd that the physical variable (x), which is gauge invariant 3, carries one
unit charge ( [q(y), (x)] = (x) ) and point magnetic eld ([b(y), (x)] = 1
2(x  y) (x)) at
the matter point together with the vector potential around the matter point ([ai(y), (x)] =
 ikck(x, y) (x)). this situation corresponds to the dual picture of the qed case where (x)
1
carries the radial e eld together with the scalar potential around the matter point [1, 11].

next, let us consider the space-time transformation properties of the physical variables. to
this end, let us consider the improved poincare generators [12] constructed from the symmet-
ric (belinfante) energy-momentum tensor [13] which being (manifestly) gauge invariant and
satisfying the poincare algebra:

p 0 = z d2xh||2 + |di|2 + m2||2i ,
p i = z d2xhdi + (di)i ,
m 12 = z d2x ijxi hdj + (dj)i ,
m 0i = x0p i  z d2x xi h||2 + |dj|2 + m2||2i .

first of all, we consider the spatial translation generated by

[ (x), p j] = j (x)  i (x)z d2z(cid:16)j

zck(x, z) + j

xck(x, z)(cid:17) ak(z).

(17)

(18)

this shows the translational anomaly in general. however, we assume that this anomaly should
not appear in order that  responds conventionally to translations because the translation
invariance is a genuine property of space-times which is independent on the matter contents.
with this assumption, we obtain the condition that ck(x, z) be translationally invariant

zck(x, z) = i
i

xck(x, z),

(19)

i.e., ck(x, z) = ck(x  z). furthermore, this condition also guarantees the correct spatial
translation law for another physical eld in (15): [ai(x), p j] = ijai(x).

by applying similar assumption to the time translation we obtain

[ (x), p 0] = i0 (x) + (x)z d2z 0(ck(x  z))ak(z)

:= i0 (x),
[ai(x), p 0] = i0ai(x)

(20)

3here, one should distinguish gauge invariance and gauge independence: our physical variables are gauge
invariant but they are gauge dependent because its explicit form are gauge dependent. id like to thank dr. j.
watson for providing a source of this note in his talk [10].

with a necessary condition of

0ck(x  z) = 0.

(21)

however, for the rotation and lorentz boost, the anomaly is present as the spin or other

properties of , ai:

[ (x), m 12] = iijxij (x) + 12(x) (x),
[ai(x), m 12] = ijkxjkai(x)  iijaj(x) + ii12(x),
[ (x), m 0j] = ix0j (x)  ixj0 (x) + 0j(x) (x),
[ai(x), m 0j] = ix0jai(x)  ixj0ai(x)  iija0 + ii0j(x)(x);

or in the compact form these are expressed as follows

[f(x), m ] = ixf(x)  ixf(x) + i

f(x) + i

 (x),

(x) = i(x) (x), 




ai(x) = i(x),

 (x) = i(x) (x),

 z d2z ikck(x  z)j 0(z),
 z d2z c(x  z)  j(z),

respectively. then, it is straightforward to show that the anomaly terms can be written in the
simple forms:

12(x)

 z d2z (x  z)  c(x  z)j 0(z),
 z d2z (xi  zi) c(x  z)  j(z).

(26)

this can be considered as a generalization of the coulomb gauge to the arbitrary ck case: with
a particular choice of ck which corresponds to the coulomb gauge, this reduces to the previous
result in coulomb gauge.

b. gauge xing vs ck

now, id like to note an issue, which has been controversial, about the connection of gauge
xing and ck function. the problem which makes the situation complicate is that the con-
nection is not one to one in general; in most case of (partial) gauge xings which allow some
remaining gauge transformations, ck is not uniquely determined. but there is one exceptional
case of the coulomb gauge where the connection is one to one and so only one ck is allowed.4
let us consider these two cases in detail.

a) axial gauge, a1  0

in this case, the gauge transformation function  should be x1 independent, i.e., 1 = 0
in order to preserve the given gauge choice under the gauge transformation: a1  a1 + 1 :=
0, a2  a2 + 2. on the other hand, the physical matter eld , which is gauge invariant,
becomes

in this gauge. so, in order to make it gauge invariant in that gauge,

 = eir ckak

 = eir c2a2



one should require

  eir c2(a2 2

z )ei := 

z c2(x  z) = 2(x  z), 1
2

z c1(x  z) = 0.

(27)

the general solution of this equation can be expressed by two arbitrary functions, f and g:

c1(x  z) = f (x1  z1),

4however, when the gauge xing is not introduced, the xing ck does not mean xing a gauge.

c2(x  z) = (x1  z1)(x2  z2) + g(x1  z1).

(28)

7

the existence of these two arbitrary functions makes the analysis complicate. but for the
simplest case of f = g = 0, the physical matter eld  becomes (x) = eir x2
dz2a2(x1,z2)(x)
and it carries the vector potential tail along straight line from the matter point, a1(y) =
 1

 (x1  y1)(x2  y2); this is the usual line-integral form of the physical variables [1].



b) coulomb gauge,   a = 0

in this case, the gauge transformation function  should satisfy laplace equation 2 = 0
over all space in order to maintain the given gauge under the gauge transformation:   a 
  a + 2 := 0. however, since there is only the trivial solution of  = 0 for the laplace
equation over all space, we dont need to introduce the gauge compensating factor in the
physical matter eld:  = .
formula (15). then, it is to not dicult to show that there is a unique solution of

in other words, w = r d2z cj(x, z)aj(z) := 0 in the general

cj(x  z) = 

1
2

(x  z)j
|x  z|2 .

(29)

hence, this case corresponds to a complete gauge xing.

c. (anyonic) commutation relations

the next thing i would like to note is the commutation relations of the physical variables

which show the anyonic commutation relations in general:

i

(x) (y)  e i
(x)(y)  e
hai(x), (y)i = 
[ai(x), aj(y)] =

 (xy) (y) (x) = 0,
 (xy)(y) (x) = 2(x  y),
(y) [ikck(y  x) + x

1

i
 hij2(x  y) + ij(x  y) + x
i y

i (x  y)] ,

where we have introduced two functions

(x  y) = z d2z klck(x  z)cl(y  z),
ij(x  y) = iky

j ck(y  x)  jkx

i ck(x  y),

j (x  y)i ,

   , etc.,

(30)

(31)

which are totally antisymmetric under the interchange of all the indices. if we consider the
particular case of coulomb gauge, we can nd that (x  y) = 0 [ij(x  y) = ij2(x  y)].
but in general this is not true ! this implies that the physical variable  satises the anyonic
commutation relation depending on ck: hence, this can be a natural denition of the anyon

8

in the minimal form of (15) !; we can introduce any arbitrary gauge invariant factors except
for the minimally introduced gauge compensating factor of (15) but there is no unique way to
x them.5 on the other hand, we note that the semenos construction of (13), what we have
introduced in the former part of this talk, can be considered like as [16]

(x) = exp(cid:20) i

2 z d2y (x  y)j 0(y)(cid:21) (x)

(32)

in our formulation; these operator has the (gauge invariant) exchanging phase factor of (14) in
addition to the phase factor of (30) for the minimal part .

d. physical and unphysical eects of the rotational anomaly for 

now, to discuss the gauge artifact problem on the rotational anomaly let us note the fol-

lowing general relation

m 12  m 12

c 



2 z d2z k(zka  a  z  aak),

where m 12
c

is the canonical angular momentum

c = z d2z(cid:26)z  [ + ()] + z  a(  a) +
m 12


2

k(z  aak)(cid:27) .

(33)

(34)

c and m 12

the surface terms in m 12  m 12
c , which are gauge invariant for the rapidly decreasing
gauge transformation function , give the gauge independent spin terms (1/4)q2 (uncon-
ventional) and 0 (conventional) in m 12, respectively. from which the anomalous spin q
2 of
(12) for the matter eld is readily seen to follow for general gauges. on the other hand, the
second term of m 12
c , which vanishes only in the coulomb gauge, gives for the general gauges
the gauge restoring contribution to the rotation transformation for the matter eld. this can
be summarized by

[m 12, ] = ix   +

1

2

q + (gauge restoring terms for non-rotation invariant gauge),(35)

in which the second term is the gauge invariant, i.e., physical (anomalous) spin term and the
last one is gauge dependent artifact term.

5in the particular case of non-relativistic delta-function sources, there is an unique way to dene the additional
factor [14]. moreover, there is an interesting formulation where the additional factor is determined by the
temporal non-locality [15] contrast to ours where the temporal locality was assumed from the start in (15). but
it is unclear that their formulation provides a new determination of the factor since there is no retardation
eect; there are only the instantaneous interactions in our case.

iii. conclusion

in summary, we have shown that the use of the diracs physical variables in the cs-matter

theories are:
a) generalization of the coulomb gauge result to arbitrary ck cases,
b) providing a natural denition of anyons modulus the gauge invariant factors which will be
determined by more fundamental theorems.

involving the gauge artifact problems, what have been claried in this talk are:

a) the anomalous spin of the base matter eld is a physical eect and not the gauge artifact;
and hence the coulomb gauge is the best one to obtain the physical spin directly. on the
other hand, since the boson commutation relation of the base matter eld, [(x), (y)] = 0 is
gauge independent (thought not gauge invariant), this is a counter example [4] for the quantum
mechanical spin-statistics connection [7].
b) the minimal form of the physical matter elds is anyon eld (i.e., satises the anyonic
commutation relations) but depending on ck; its physical contents depend on ck explicitly. the
gauge artifact nature of this anyon, when a gauge xing is introduced, is not so manifest because
of complication in relation of ck and the gauge xing. this problem has not been completely
resolved yet; though the physical matter eld with additional gauge invariant factor has the
physical exchanging phase factor additionally, the problem for the minimal part remains.

as a further work, the non-abelian generalization will be interesting. but i have no idea at
present mainly because our result depends on the detailed expression of the physical variables
6 which will be very non-trivial ones [18].
