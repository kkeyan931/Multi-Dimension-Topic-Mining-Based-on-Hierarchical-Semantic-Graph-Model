the exclusion principle of maldacena and strominger is seen to follow from deformed

heisenberg algebras associated with the chiral rings of sn orbifold cfts. these deformed
algebras are related to quantum groups at roots of unity, and are interpreted as algebras of

space-time eld creation and annihilation operators. we also propose, as space-time origin
of the stringy exclusion principle, that the ads3  s3 space-time of the associated six-
dimensional supergravity theory acquires, when quantum eects are taken into account, a
non-commutative structure given by suq(1, 1)suq(2). both remarks imply that nite n
n +1 . this implies that a proper
eects are captured by quantum groups slq(2) with q = e
framework for the theories in question is given by gravity on a non-commutative spacetime

i

with a q-deformation of eld oscillators. an interesting consequence of this framework is a

holographic interpretation for a product structure in the space of all unitary representations

of the non-compact quantum group suq(1, 1) at roots of unity.

introduction

the ads/cft [1][2][3] correspondence gives a large class of examples where the

existence of a well dened theory of quantum gravity follows from the existence of a dual

conformal eld theory. often we have access to regimes where perturbative string theory

is not valid. the usual stringy explanations for the niteness of the quantum gravity, like

an innite tower of massive states, are therefore not directly applicable. we can ask what,

from the spacetime point of view, are the mechanisms that lead to a nite quantum theory

of gravity.

numerous recent studies have given considerable insight into the nature of the

ads/cft correspondence. some of the novel features of the emerging spacetime the-

ory can be seen in [4-6]. for investigation of many of the outstanding questions regarding
5d black holes related to a system of q1 d1 and q5 d5-branes the cft of sn (x) ( x is
k3 or t 4 ), where n = q1q5, provides a particularly useful laboratory[7,8,9,10]. these
orbifold cfts have played important and diverse roles in recent works, see for example

[11,12,13].

one of the most interesting phenomena found in these studies is a stringy exclusion

principle [4], related to the unitarity of representations of the superconformal algebra in the
2d cft with target space sn (x). the n parameter here is analogous to the n of su (n )
yang mills theory in the ads5  s5 case. here 1/n is the expansion parameter for the
semiclassical gravitational expansion for 6d gravity on ads3  s3. the question that we
address in the present work concerns the spacetime explanation of this exclusion principle
and its meaning at the level of supergravity. we argue that the classical ads3  s3
spacetime should be understood as a non-commutative manifold suq(1, 1)  suq(2), with
q a root of unity, when quantum eects are taken into account. we also suggest that an

identical deformation applies to the (supergravity) eld oscillators themselves. earlier, an

equivalent role of q-oscillators at roots of unity was proposed in [14], in the context of two

dimensional string theory[15]. we are now lead to suggest that this represents a general

feature of the matrix-spacetime correspondence.

in general a systematic way to dene deformations of spacetime is studied under the

heading of non-commutative geometry [16]. gauge theory on non-commutative spaces has

found a natural role in d-brane physics recently [17]. there is also a large literature at-

tempting to dene gravity in the non-commutative setting (for a review of the successes

and diculties see for example [18]). the version of gravity that we propose from cft has

1

some elements of similarity with the above literature, but also some dierences. one char-

acteristic feature implied in the present (and also other) non-commutative representations

is the appearance of a space-time uncertainty relation [19].

the plan of the paper is the following.

in section 2, we derive several important
algebraic properties of the chiral ring of sn (x). for concreteness we work with x = t 4

but the arguments are general. we describe in a simple setting how the implementation

of the exclusion principle requires that the creation and annihilation operators of elds

obey a modied heisenberg algebra. the relevant heisenberg algebras are found from the

cft dual. they are shown to have a representation in terms of q-oscillators [20] with

i

q = e

n +1 . the q-oscillators are also related to slq(2) ( note that in discussions where the
real form does not matter much we use this notation, otherwise we will distinguish between

suq(2) and suq(1, 1) and even slq(2, r)). at large n , we have the ordinary heisenberg
algebra. the discussion in the rst part of section 2 is restricted to a simple class of eld

operators which, in the cft, are related to the untwisted sector. we proceed to give some

details on the construction of twisted sector operators. the same qualitative properties

and deformation of heisenberg algebras also survive when we consider the operators from

the twisted sector.

the nal part of section 2 derives the detailed form of the exclusion principle on

the generators of the chiral primaries. although the general fact of the existence of the

exclusion principle follows from the unitarity of the superconformal algebra, the detailed

form of the exclusion principle coming from the orbifold cft is not predicted by this

argument. some interesting new features are derived and turn out to be precisely captured

by the idea of a quantum group symmetry, as elaborated in section 3. the results can be

expressed simply in terms of a bound of the left and right su (2) quantum numbers of the

chiral primaries.

section 3 deals with a spacetime interpetation of these results. it was shown in [8]

that kk reduction of supergravity elds matches the spectrum of chiral primaries at large
n . an ordinary kk reduction on s3 produces an innite number of representations of

su (2). the truncation of the number of unitary representations is familiar in going from

the universal enveloping algebra u (su (2)) to uqsu (2). the deformation of the algebra
can be related to a deformation of the su (2) manifold to a non-commutative manifold

suq(2) [21]. in terms of the geometry of suq(2) the cuto on the spectrum of unitary reps
of uqsu (2) means that fourier transformation on the deformed manifold involves a nite
set of su (2) representations. ( in the rest of this paper, we will not always be careful to

2

use separate notation for the q-deformed algebra and the dual q-deformed manifold, using

suq(2) for both, since it will often be clear from the context which one is being refered to.
) the detailed form of the cft cutos, derived in section 2, on the chiral primaries takes

the precise form expected from kk reduction on suq(2) with q

i

n +1 , rather than su (2).

the next part of section 3 shows that not only su (2) = s3 is deformed to suq(2) but
that the ads3 = su (1, 1) is also deformed to suq(1, 1), again with the same value of q.
this allows a discussion of the cutos on the superalgebra descendants of chiral primaries.

since we are claiming that the cft living on an ordinary commutative riemann surface

is equivalent to gravity on a non-commutative spacetime, consistency with holography

requires ordinary riemann surface to appear in the boundary of suq(1, 1). a result of [22]
allows us to prove that it does. this discussion of holography requires, not surprisingly, a

consideration of operators which allow the creation of states of suciently large mass that

they can change the background into one with black holes.

we observe that the q values obtained from the deformed heisenberg algebra and from

the above q-deformation of su (2) are identical. the agreement of the q-parameters from

two dierent kinds of physics leads to a speculation on algebraic structures associated to

the chiral ring and their space-time interpretation. we then outline an approach, based

on the ordinary wzw cft/quantum group correspondence, to make the presence of non-

commutative spacetime coordinates explicit. in the nal part of section 3, we attempt to

get a glimpse of the possibilities coming from generalizing the idea of q-deformed spacetime

to other ads backgrounds entering the ads-cft correspondence.

we conclude with a summary and outline possible strategies to improve the under-

standing of the relevance of gravity in the non-commutative setting to the elucidation of

quantum eects in the ads-cft correspondence.

2. algebraic properties of chiral ring of scft on sn (t 4)

the spacetime elds in ads3s3 supergravity are related to chiral primary operators
in the dual cft. a detailed discussion of the spacetime physics requires a derivation of

several properties of the chiral ring, directly from the cft. the properties of interest fall

into two broad categories. one concerns the nilpotence of the generators of the chiral ring

and the second concerns the truncation in the number of generators. sections 2.1 and 2.3

concern the former property. section 2.4 concerns the latter. section 2.2 contains some

technical points necessary for the subsequent discussion.

the two fermions are each chosen from one of two complex fermions, from the left moving

and the right moving part of the cft respectively. the anti-commutators are

(2.5)

we can rewrite (2.4) as

[ap, ap] = 1 

2n
n

(2.6)

this algebra has been studied as a deformation of the heisenberg algebra and has been

named the parafermion algebra ( see [23] and earlier refs there ). one has the relation

p(n) = apap = n 

n(n  1)

n

.

(2.7)

and also that p(n + 1) = apap. we have shown that the chiral ring ( and its su (2)

descendants ) has relations of the same form as the parafermion algebra.

another oscillator algebra which is related to the ring of chiral operators and their

conjugates is the q-oscillator algebra, for q a root of unity. the relevance of the q-deformed

oscillator algebra is easily guessed. because the 1 is constructed in terms of fermions,
it satises n+1

1 = 0. the usual heisenberg algebra relation

[a, a] = 1

(2.8)

is not compatible with this nilpotence. a deformation which is compatible is the q-oscillator

algebra

with q = e

q  q1a
n +1 . indeed it can be checked that

aqa

i

qaq = q n,

aq(a

q)n+1 = (a

q)n+1aq.

(2.9)

(2.10)

so imposing the nilpotence is consistent with the relations of the algebra. the q-oscillator

algebra can be related to slq(2) [20] by a map in which aq

2 is related to x, a
q

2

is related

to x+ and n is related to h.

a precise connection to the q-oscillator algebra, which we will develop, allows us to

associate a hopf algebra structure to the set of operators generated by the chiral operators

and their conjugates. this will use results on the hopf algebra structure of q-oscillators.

ref.

[24] gives a co-product , an antipode s, and an r-matrix for the q-oscillators.

this allows us to associate all these structures to the algebra of chiral operators and their

conjugates.

5

we can transform from the oscillators in (2.1) to the q-oscillators. a crucial role is

played by the functions p(n) and q(n)

(2.11)

to all orders in 1/n , they can be used to map the parafermion oscillators and the q-

oscillators to the ordinary heisenberg algebra [23]. to map between parafermion oscillators

and heisenberg algebra, we use

ap = ar p(n)

n

(2.12)

this map is singular at nite n because p(n = n + 1) = 0. to map between q-oscillators
and heisenberg algebra we use

aq = ar q(n)

n

(2.13)

this is also well-dened in the large n expansion but becomes singular precisley at nite

n = n + 1, if we choose q = e

i

n +1 . to map between parafermion algebra and q-oscillator

algebra

ap = aqs p(n)

q(n)

(2.14)

this map is well dened for values of n between 0 and n + 1. these are the only values
of interest because the (cc) ring is just the quotient of the parafermion algebra by the
relation a(n+1)
the q-algebra by the analogous relations

= 0. this quotient algebra can be mapped to the quotient of

= 0, a
p

n+1

p

a(n+1)
q

= 0,

a

(n+1)

= 0.

using this map to q-oscillators we can write down the co-product for the algebra over

the complex numbers generated by the c and c. for example

(ap) = (aqs p(n)
= (aq)(s p(n)

q(n)

q(n)

)

)

(2.15)

where we used the algebra homomorphism property of the co-product.

6

to recapitulate, we have invoked q-oscillators as the underlying explanation of the

nilpotence of the generators of the chiral ring. note that this dervation of the cuto on the

number operators of the generators of the chiral ring has a similar avour to the standard

derivation based on the chiral superconformal algebra, but has important dierences since

the  are generically non-chiral objects from the worldsheet point of view and have a

spacetime interpretation in terms of eld oscillators.

in general our cft generates a

sequence of oscillators labeled by the harmonic forms and an index labelling cycle lengths.

a more careful look at the deformation of the algebra shows that the deformation terms
appearing in the commutator of 1,1
1 involve also the other operators which
count the number of oscillators of other types. requiring the positivity of < 11 > in
states with various oscillator numbers imposes constraints on the values that these number

1 with 1,1

operators can take at nite n . for example the terms involving the pure twist operators

take the form given below :

[1,1

1 , 1,1

1] = 1 

2
n

(n1 +xl

al|o

l >< ol| +   )

(2.16)

where the al are some positive coecients growing with the twist number l. we will not
try to unravel these constraints here, which will in general involve not just chiral primaries

but also their descendants. we will turn to a more direct determination of the constraints

on the operators of greatest interest, the generators of the chiral ring, in section (2.4).

2.2. twist operators

there are twist operators [25] for a boson which have conformal dimension given by :

(k,n(x)) =

k
2n

(1 

k
n

).

these satisfy the condition

x(z)k,n(x)(0) = z( k

n 1)k,n +   

so that under transport around this twist operator we have the monodromy

for fermions, we have k,n(), which have dimension

2ik

n x.

x  e

(k,n()) =

k2
2n2

7

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

and satisfy

after bosonization,

(k)(z)k,n() = zk/n +   

(k) = ei(k)
k,n((k)) = ei k

n (k)

we have formed linear combinations

(k) = 1 + k2 +    knn

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

which transform by a phase k under the action of the n-cycle permutation. the boson
(k) bosonizes the pair (k) and (k). take the operator

n() =

n (k)

ei k

n1

yk=1

(2.24)

it has conformal weight n

6 + 1

12n  1
4 .

for the torus t 4 we have two complex bosons and two complex fermions so the
operators n(x i, i) are built by combining twist operators for the bosons and fermions,
with the index i running from 1 to 2 :

n(x i, i) =yi,k

n i

ei k

(k)yi,k

k,n(x i

(k))

(2.25)

3 + 1

for two complex fermions, the conformal weight is n
2 . for the bosons we have
6  1
n
6n . adding up the dimensions of the bosonic and fermionic twist operators, we get the
weight (n  1)/2. the operator ei k
n (k) has a u (1) charge of k/n. after summing over k
we get a u (1) charge of (n  1). using the expressions for the left moving su (2) currents
( and the analogous ones for the right-moving ones ) we can easily check that the above
operator is annihilated by j +

6n  1

0 :

j 0 = 1(1) + 2(2)

j + = 12

j  = (1)(2)

(2.26)

this conrms we have a chiral primary obeying as it should, l0 = 1/2j0 [26].

8

we have constructed above the twist operator for a zn theory. in the case of sn we

just sum the zn twist operator over all combinations of n variables

(0,0)

n (z, z) = xi1in

(x i

i1in , i

i1in )

(2.27)

the indices i1    in are n distinct numbers between 1 to n . the most general chiral
primary can be written in terms of products of operators (p,q)
associated with a (p, q)
n
form (p,q)(x i, i) which is

(p,q)

n = xi1in

(p,q)(x i

i1 +    x i

in , i

i1 +    i

in)(x i

i1in , i

i1in )

(2.28)

schematically we will write, using a factorization of the zn twist operators in terms

of chiral and anti-chiral operators,

n(z, z) =xin

oin (z) oin (z)

(2.29)

where oin depends on x and  elds labeled by in, which equals a set of indices (i1,    in).
the indices i1, i2    in, run over n distinct numbers between 1 to n . this acts on the
vacuum to give a state

(2.31)

(2.32)

this changes the sign of the oscillator number associated with a conformal eld. since the

expansion of a conformal eld oin of weight  looks like pm oin

integral will extract oin

m > 0.

2.3. deformed heisenberg algebras of the twist operators.

in the previous subsection, we discussed deformed heisenberg algebras associated with

operators in the untwisted sector of the cft. these deformed algebras led to the nilpotence

of the generators of the chiral ring. they may also be expected to lead to a niteness in the

number of generators of the chiral ring. we will see that the same qualitative properties

can be deduced from the deformed heisenberg algebras associated with oscillators coming

from the twisted sector. we will use here some of these facts about twist operators derived

in the previous subsection.

we can write the relations of the heisenberg algebra, taking n even :

[n, n]

n

n ]

[ oin oin, oi

(2.33)

cn,n is the (positive) number of elements in the conjugacy class in sn characterized by
one non-trivial cycle of length n. to leading order in large n this coecient behaves like
n n. the separate purely chiral and purely anti-chiral commutators are computed using

contour integrals.

(2.34)

after redening the normalization of these oscillators by dividing by this order of a con-

algebra is

is positive and appears with a minus sign in front of



a sum, with positive coecients, of number operators for the various oscillators in the

theory. this can be done along the lines of the calculation in section 2. the positivity

10

of the coecients in front of the number operators follows from the fact that they are

related to the numbers which appear in the class multiplication algebra of the symmetric

group. we pause to explain what we mean by this. let ta be a conjugacy class in the

symmetric group sn . dene in the group algebra of sn the sum of all the elements in ta,

and denote it, by a slight abuse of notation, ta. for two conjugacy classes ta and tb we

have a product which can be expanded

tatb = cc

abtc

(2.36)

the coecients cc

ab are positive. thus there are various constraints on the the values of
the number operators coming from the requirement that < aa > is positive. this puts

restrictions on the values that the number operators can take on the states obtained by

acting with the chiral primary operators on the vacuum.

it is very interesting that the commutators between oscillators corresponding to per-

mutations of dierent cycle lengths are also non-trivial, although they vanish at large

n .

[l1, l2 ] = a1(l2l1+1) + a2(k1,k2) + ...

(2.37)

we have on the right hand side oscillators corresponding to permutations for which the
sum of cycle lengths adds up to l2  l1.

relations of the type (2.37) imply that underlying this system there should be a

description given by a hamiltonian of the form

h = h0 +xijk

cijkijk +   

(2.38)

the h0 is a sum related to the deformed heisenberg algebras associated to each individual

cft chiral primary operator ( and descendants ). the coecients cijk are be determined

by group theory together with the intersection form on the manifold x. more precisely

we recall that the index i is really a double index (i1i2), i1 labeling cycle lengths and i2

labeling forms on the manifold x. the coecients cijk may be expected to decompose

into a product ci1j1k1 which are struture constants of symmetric group multiplication, and

ci2j2k2 which are intersection numbers coming from the manifold x. interesting questions
relate to the inclusion of non-chiral primaries in (2.38).

11

2.4. generators of the chiral ring.

the single particle states in gravity are identied with the generators of the chiral

ring of the cft. multiparticle states are associated with chiral primary operators which

are products of the generators [8]. it will be important to clarify the nature of the cutos

on generators of the chiral ring which comes from the orbifold cft. for concreteness we
will discuss these relations in the context of the cft of sn (t 4). for this purpose we will

write down some explicit formulae for the chiral primary operators associated with the

twisted sectors of the sn orbifold theory. we argue that the simple pattern that emerges
from such a discussion extends to the cft for sn (k3).

among the generators of the chiral primaries are 0,0

1 operator
corresponds to the vacuum state in cft, so it does not correspond to a particle excitation
in gravity. in an sn orbifold cft the index n is clearly cuto at n . the su (2)  su (2)
quantum numbers (2jl, 2jr) of (0,0)

n. the operator 0,0

n are (n  1, n  1).

the cft also contains operators p,q

n for any (p, q) and any n extending up to n .
however some of these have the interesting property that they can be written in terms

of products of generators. it will turn out that these relations have a remarkably simple

consequence. the cutos can be described by saying that, for the generators, we have a

bound

max (2jl, 2jr) = (n  1).

(2.39)

note that this cuto is stronger than the one based on the unitarity of the superconformal

algebra [26] which says that max (2jl, 2jr) = c/3 = 2n . in the next section we will
explain that the precise cuto (2.39) follows from a simple spacetime argument based on

the picture that quantum eects result in a q-deformation of spacetime, with q = e

the rst set of relevant relations takes the form

(p,q)
n = (p,q)

1 (0,0)
n .

for (p = 1, q = 0) and (p = 0, q = 1), this follows trivially from the denitions :

where the objects with simple zn transformation properties (k) have been dened in

(2.23). now we have to recall that the product that denes the relations between the

generators of the chiral ring involves taking the ope of the cft elds and analysing the

leading z-independent term. the k = 0 term certainly gives a contribution to the leading

constant term. however the other terms give terms that vanish in the z = 0 limit. but

the k = 0 term is immediately identied with the rst line of (2.42). the case of k3

involves a slightly more complicated form for these operators. we will have, in general,
some function of x appearing in the form f (x) . the similar decomposition into zn

invariants will have a sum pk1,k2,k3

a non-zero leading term in the ope we again have k1 = k2 = k3 = 0.

f(k1)(k1)(k3), where k1 + k2 + k3 = 0(mod n ). for

now consider the cases either p or q is equal to 2, but they are not both equal to 2.

in these cases we show directly here that (p,q)

(n 1) can be written in terms of products of
other generators. the proof in all these cases is essentially of the same form, so we will
illustrate in the case of (2,1)

(n 1). the candidate operators which can give (2,1)

the set of operators that can appear is restricted by conservation of charge (2jl, 2jr),

and by the structure constants of symmetric group multiplication. as an illustration

finally we outline the proof of an equation expressing the operator (2,2)

other operators. we can start with a product of the form (0,0)

(2.46)

where k is an odd number. a term like (1,1)
(n) is allowed by left and right u (1) charge
conservation, but it is not allowed by the multiplication law of the symmetric group, since
the product of a permutation with a single non-trivial cycle of length (n  1) and another
with length 2 is even or odd depending on the sign of (1)n whereas the parity of the
permutation with cycle of length n is (1)(n 1). thus we may expect a relation with the
product 0,0

2 on the left and on the right hand side a term proportional to (2,2)

n 0,0

(n 1)

and other terms proportional to products of . no other term with a single  can appear.

terms corresponding to smaller cycles would require associated forms of degrees which

highest n allowed for (2,2)
charges 2jl = 2jr = n  1.

(n 1) can be written in terms of products of other s, so the
n among the generators of the chiral ring has n = n  2 and

3. spacetime interpretation of the exclusion principle

we now proceed to discuss the spacetime interpretation of the exclusion principle. the

rst main result in this section is that the detailed form of the cutos on the generators

of the chiral ring has a simple interpretation in terms of our proposal that spacetime
is deformed from ads3  s3 to suq(1, 1)  suq(2).
properties of suq(2) which follow from the consideration of study of unitary representations

in section 3.1, we review some

of uqsu (2). we then identify the q parameter associated with the deformed geometry,

by comparing to the discussion in the last part of section 2. in section 3.2, we present

arguments in favour of the deformation of the non-compact part of spacetime ( in addition

to the deformation of the compact part which played a direct role in the discussion of

the chiral primaries). in section 3.3, we show that the deformation to suq(1, 1) plays an

important role in the discussion of the cutos on descendants of chiral primaries. section

3.4 discusses holography in the q-deformed context. in section 3.5 we observe the equality

of the geometrical q-parameter with the one obtained from deformed heisenberg algebras

in section 2, and we discuss its implications. in section 3.6 we outline some steps towards

an explicit derivation of a non-commutative space-time coordinates from the orbifold cft.

in the nal part we begin a very preliminary discussion of other ads backgrounds.

3.1. non-commutative s3 and the cuto on chiral primaries.

the above cutos on the left and and right su(2) quantum numbers of the generators

of the chiral ring have an interpretation in terms of kk reduction on a non-commutative
n +1 . we have the oscillators (p,q)
deformation of s3 = su (2) to suq(2) with q = e
associated with single particle states of supergravity on ads3  s3 carrying su (2) spins
2jl = l  1 + p and 2jr = l  1 + q. the kk reduction on s3 gives states characterized
by the reps of su (2) = s3 because functions on su (2) can be expanded in terms of
matrix elements of representations of the group. the manifold s3 being isomorphic to the

l

i

15

group su (2) admits a natural deformation to su (2)q [21] which preserves many group
structures. such a manifold admits suq(2)  su (2)q symmetry.

the universal enveloping algebra uqsl(2, c) is generated by h, x+, x with the

relations

[h, x] = x
[x+, x] =

(q2h  q2h )

q  q1

(3.1)

the algebra is also equipped with a co-product  : a  a  a, where a = uqsl(2, c).
as an example

(x+) = x+  qh + qh  x+

(3.2)

note that the coproduct is not invariant under permutation of the rst and second copies of

the algebra. the two co-products are related by the r-matrix. this non-cocommutativity

leads to the fact that the manifolds constructed from these algebras have non-commutative

spacetime coordinates.

specifying a real form of the lie algebra, e.g. a compact form su (2)q or a non-
compact form su (1, 1)q involves the choice of an involution  which is a map from the
algebra to itself, satisfying

(ab) = (a)(b)

(3.3)

the q-algebra is also equipped with a coproduct  : a  a  a. one also requires a
compatibility between the conjugation and the coproduct which can take one of two forms.

(i)   = 
(ii)   = 

(3.4)

if we require i the su (2) involution exists for real q but not |q| = 1. if we require ii, the
compact involution exists for roots of unity. we will discuss involutions which go to those
related to su (1, 1) in the limit q  1 in section 4.

given a denition of conjugation, compatible with the q-deformed algebra we can

i

discuss unitarity of representations. the set of unitary highest weight reps of su (2)q for
q = e
k+2 is truncated to those having 2j  k. the algebra of functions on the non-
commutative manifold su (2)q at roots of unity is given by the matrix elements of a nite
set of representations.

the existence of su (2)q  su (2)q symmetry associated with the q-sphere implies
that kk reduction on the non-commutative sphere should correspond to a representations

16

which have (2jl, 2jr) which are both bounded by 2k. equivalently max(2jl, 2jr)  k.
this is precisely the form of the cutos we get from the above discussion, with a value of

q = e

i

n +1 .

in this way we are lead to a suggestion that some of the nite n constraints in the
ads3  s3 background can be captured by kaluza-klein reduction on a non-commutative
3-sphere su (2)q.

3.2. non-commutative ads3 and suq(1, 1)

we have argued that nite n eects lead to a deformation of the classical s3 of
spacetime to a q-deformed s3. we will argue here that the nite n eects also deform

the ads3 part of spacetime into a non-commutative manifold. the denition of the
non-compact quantum group has a number of subtleties. we use the proposed relation

between the non-compact quantum group and the cft to learn something about the

correct properties of the non-compact quantum group.

in the classical case, kk reduction of scalars on the sphere s3 leads to states which

correspond to the chiral primaries which are nite dimensional highest weight reps of

su (2) and innite-dimensional highest weight reps of su (1, 1). the highest weight h of

the su (1, 1) is related to the highest weight j of the su (2) by h = j/2. this follows, from

the spacetime point of view, by writing down a sum of laplacians on the sphere and the

ads space, and taking into account the mixing between the scalars and some modes of

the antisymmetric tensor elds. the net eect is to obtain a relation of the form

4h(h  1) = j(j  2)

(3.5)

which allows a solution h = j/2. we expect that the kk reduction of the s3

q involves the
q-casimir rather than the ordinary casimir. a condition of the form h = j/2 present in

cft, will only follow, if the su (1, 1) is also q-deformed.

this gives an argument that the ads3 ( = su (1, 1) ) space is also q-deformed. de-

formations of the non-compact real forms are signicantly more subtle than the compact
form. for example, one non-compact form of [27] exists for real q 6= 1 at the level of
hopf algebra but does not have the right properties to lead to a quantum group as a non-

commutative manifold [28]. this subtlety, fortunately does not concern us since we have

a q-deformed sl(2) for q equaling a root of unity.

deforming the algebra of bounded functions on the non-compact group will involve

replacing a set of classical unitary representations of su (1, 1) with some class of unitary

17

representations of su (1, 1)q. typically in quantum group-cft relations the structure

of the quantum group representations is similar to those appearing in the cft. in this

case the conformal eld theory contains su (1, 1) representations which have a highest

weight. so we need a denition of the non-compact form which admits the discrete series

representations.

representations of uqsu (1, 1) at roots of unity have been studied in [22] and [29].

there are analogs of the unitary discrete series. this is an encouraging sign that their

reps. might be useful in a denition of the q-deformed su (1, 1) manifold relevant here,

since the proposed cft dual has discrete series representations of su (1, 1).

the denition of the q-deformed ads3 used above and in sections 3.3, 3.4 is based on

uqsu (1, 1), where the * operation satises the rel. (ii) of (3.4) between the conjugation

and the co-product. a dierent possibility which we have not explored much is to use

uqsl(2, r) [27][30] since the classical isomorphism between su (1, 1) and sl(2, r) does
not extend to the case q 6= 1. while the discussion above and in sections 3.3, 3.4 nds
evidence in favour of uqsu (1, 1), it remains an interesting question to nd analogous

applications of uqsl(2, r).

3.3. discussion of descendants

while we focused on chiral primary operators ( and their su (2)su (1, 1) descendants
) above, it is interesting to consider other operators which are obtained from these by acting

with the superalgebra. we can use the notation of [7] to describe the set of reps.

there are reps. d(l1,l2)

(e0,s)(n, k) the left and right su (2) quantum numbers are 2jl =
(l1 + l2) and 2jr = (l1  l2). the left and right su (1, 1) quantum numbers are given
by 2h = (e0 + s) and 2h = (e0  s). the numbers (n, k) are quantum numbers under a
symmetry group so(4)  so(nt ), where nt = 21 for k3, and nt = 5 for t 4.

n have quantum numbers (2jl = n  1 + p, 2jr = n  1 + q), and
2hl = p + q + n  1 and 2hr = p  q + n  1. this allows an identication of these 
oscillators with figs. 1, 2, and 3 of [7]. the oscillator (2,0)
(l+2,1) of
g. 1. the oscillator 2,2
(l+2) and
(l+3) are associated with d(l+2,0)
(0,0)

(l+2,0) of g. 2. the oscillators (1,1)

(l+2) corresponds to d(l+2,1)

the oscillators p,q

(l+1) corresponds to d(l+2,0)

(l+2,0) of g. 3.

the discussion in section 3 implies that there is a cuto in the set of ds in fig. 1,
given by max(l + 2) = (n  2). for fig. 2 we have max(l + 1) = (n  2). for fig. 3, we
have max(l + 2) = (n  1).

18

once we have decided how the chiral primaries are cuto, susy requires the associated

descendants to be cuto correspondingly.

it is interesting to ask nevertheless how far

we can predict the cutos on the descendants using only the quantum group symmetry
suq(1, 1)  suq(2). for concreteness we discuss fig. 2. to carry out the argument we
will need the fact both su (2) and su (1, 1) are q-deformed. for su (2) we have the usual
2j  (n  1), where 2j denotes the larger of 2jl and 2jr. for suq(1, 1) we have the
cuto 2h  n + 1, using the result of [29] on the consistent restriction to a set of unitary
suq(1, 1) reps.

using these cutos we can correctly predict the cutos on the entire diamond of [7]

except for the one rep. in the middle. the correct way to cut-o the set of reps is of course

the one compatible with susy, and the extra state in the middle, allowed by unitarity

of suq(1, 1) and suq(2) should not appear. the consistent truncation should follow from
constraints based on larger algebra. the simplest candidate is suq(2|1, 1), but some larger
algebra containing this as a subalgebra could be involved. it is very appealing nevertheless

that the idea of q-deformation of the bosonic geometry alone is suciently powerful to

predict the correct cutos for almost the entire gure.

3.4. boundary of q-su(1,1) and holography.

we are arguing here that the spacetime gravity theory which can be reconstructed

from the cft, has nite n eects which can be understood in terms of a non-commutative

spacetime. among other things, we have argued that a non-commutative q-deformation of

the su (1, 1) manifold is relevant. an important feature of the ads-cft correspondence,

emphasized in [3] is that it involves a theory at the boundary being dual to the bulk

gravity theory. in all the ads/cft examples of [1] the boundary theory lives on a space
x which appears as a factor in a boundary space of the form x  y . similarly in [31] we
have string theory on a manifold which at innity takes the form s3  s2 and is dual to
a gauge theory on a manifold s3. more generally we may expect x to appear as the base

of a bration at innity. another very simple string-gauge theory correspondence ts this

general paradigm. the string theory of 2d qcd on a riemann surface  [32][33][34] is
related to a topological string theory on the cotangent bundle t  [35]. the boundary of
the r2 bre is s1 so the boundary of the target is an s1 bration over .

in this non-commutative context, an interesting property of the q  su (1, 1) mani-
fold follows from the assumption that the standard holographic picture continues to hold.
assuming that holography continues to hold, the q  su (1, 1) manifold should have a

19

boundary containing an ordinary commutative torus, on which the dual nite n orbifold

cft is dened. indeed, one has [22] a tensor product structure in the space of unitary
reps of uq(su (1, 1)) of the form

uq(su (1, 1)) = uq(su (2))  u (su (1, 1))

(3.6)

this means that if we dene the non-commutative deformed algebra of functions on q-

su (1, 1), using this class of unitary representations, we have a product structure on the

q-deformed manifold:

suq(1, 1) = su (1, 1)  suq(2)

allowing us to nd the boundary of q-su (1, 1). it is equal to the boundary of su (1, 1)

which is an ordinary torus times a compact q-manifold. ( the factorization of the quantum

geometry has been discussed in the context of liouville theory in [36]). consequently the

q-deformation of the ads space agrees with our expectations based on holography. the

fact that the ordinary riemann surface appears at the boundary allows us to hope that

the precise expression of holography of the form expressed in [37] as

(cid:28)expz 0o(cid:29)cf t

= zs(0)

(3.7)

will have a q-generalization where zs is obtained from a theory on the non-commutative
space suq(1, 1), and the left hand side is computed from orbifold cft on an ordinary
riemann surface.

the above discussion may raise a small puzzle which has a simple solution in this phys-

ical context. the derivation of the product structure (3.6) involves a somewhat unintuitive
procedure of dropping the operators x (n+1)
[22].
in such a discussion the full set of reps vd,z ( in the notation of [29]) for arbitrary z plays
an important role. for the discussion of particle excitations around the ads background,

and adding back the operators





x(n +1)
[n+1]!

a procedure which restricts attention ( as for example in [29] ) to the highest weights
associated to z = 1 is more appropriate. as discussed in section 2, the x+ operators are

closely related to particle creation operators, and it makes sense to include the

x(n +1)
[n+1]! if we
allow ourselves to change the background, but not if we are discussing the physics around



a xed background as in the previous section. the freedom to add the extra operators

should also be of help in setting up a spacetime description which allow accounting for the

black hole entropy, a question which received an interesting discussion recently in [9]. for

the purposes of discussing the global structure of spacetime, as we are doing here, it is

natural to include the extra operators. equivalently, the orbifold cft contains the states

relevant for black holes, so it should appear as the boundary of a quantum spacetime whose

denition allows for operators which can create very heavy objects.

20

3.5. nilpotence, niteness and the q-deformation parameter

i

for quantum group at a root of unity, the representation ring truncates to a nite set.
for q = e
k+2 we get a restriction on the su (2) spins 2j  k. we saw that the cut-os on
the spectrum of generators (p,q)
of the chiral ring takes a simple form 2j  (n  1). the
generators of the chiral ring are associated with single particle states in space-time and their

l

cut-o is directly related to the q-deformation parameter associated with the geometrical
deformation of su (2)  su (1, 1) manifold to the non-commutative manifold suq(2) 
suq(1, 1). earlier in section 2, we have argued for a q-deformation of the eld oscillators
and we derived in this context a deformed algebra slq(2). this deformation was directly
related to the nilpotence of the generators of the chiral ring. in both cases we nd the same

value of q = e

i

n +1 . while the truncation of the oscillator index can be interpreted simply

in terms of the q-deformation of the geometry of background spacetime, the deformed

heisenberg algebras appear more directly related to the deformation of the dynamics of

uctuations around the background.

in fact a number of physicists have explored the

possibility of doing eld theory in the non-commutative context by deforming the oscillator

algebras of ordinary eld theory, see for example [38]. the equality of the q-parameters

obtained from these two dierent routes suggests that there are tight consistency conditions

relating the deformation of space-time geometry and the deformation of eld oscillator

algebras.

an important role is played in non-commutative geometry of suq(2) as well as in
deformed oscillator algebras by hopf algebras. this leads to the suggestion that it might

be possible to associate a hopf algebra structure to the entire chiral ring and that such a

structure will have an interesting role in characterizing the consistency conditions governing

the deformed dynamics of elds on a deformed spacetime.

3.6. towards a construction of non-commutative spacetime from the cft.

non-commutative su (2) manifold appears naturally in connection with su (2) wzw

cft, which has been interpreted in terms of particle moving on su (2)q [39][40]. an intu-
itive understanding of the q-deformation of s3 in terms of an eective spacetime coordinate

can be given. this would be related to the four dimensional coordinate of [41], given as

xm = m

(3.8)

which appeared in the calculations of the absorption cross-sections using the eective string

model.

21

as

consider the su (2)l  su (2)r) cft symmetry currents built in terms of fermions

j a(z) = +  ta  (z)
j a(z) = +  ta  (z)

here we have the left and right moving dirac components respectively. these can be

written as linear combinations of the basic majorana fermions

a

i (z)

 a 

i (z)

as is now standard a = 1, 2 represent world sheet indices of the conformal eld theory
fermions and ,  = 1, 2, the su (2)  su (2) indices. we now consider a collective coor-
dinate for the kk space. an eective coordinate of s3 can be identied from the group

element in a wzw type construction. in general

g(z, z) = gl(z)gr(z)

we now use the well known fact that a global mode exists in the wzw theory. it is dened

through the monodromy

in terms of the current

vq = g1(z)g(ze2i)

it follows from the fact that the current j obeys an su (2) kac-moody algebra that the

vq = p eh j

global uq degree of freedom obeys a q-deformed set of commutators. the appearance of a
q-group structure is a typical phenomena in these theories and was studied extensively in

the literature[39][40]. for su(2) the value of the deformation is given by q = e

i

k+2 where

k represents the level of the current algebra. in the present case the superconformal chiral

algebra contains a an su (2) current algebra with k = n and

q = e

i

n +2

is the related q-deformation parameter.

the su (2)q coordinate uq is a conjugate to the monodromy vq. in the discussion of
su (2) wzw one actually identies the left and right monodromies. this is also appropri-

ate for the present interpretation and identication of a center of mass coordinate on s3.
the requirement of the single-valuedness of the correlation functions of the chiral primaries

22

leads to a correlation between the monodromy matrices on the left and the right. the

coordinates uq belong to the group su (2)q and the dynamics on this space is jut that of

a q-deformed top.

to summarize starting with the su (2) level k = n algebra which appears as a subal-

gebra of the superconformal algebra an explicit matrix obeying the commutation relations
n +2 provides a candidate for a non-commutative s3 as part of the

of su (2)q, with q = e

i

base space for the spacetime. this is not the same parameter that underlies the truncation

of the generators of the chiral ring, or the deformed heisenberg algebra we focused on in

section 2. the operators of interest, the chiral primaries, have simple transformation prop-

erties under the su (2) global symmetry of the cft but do not necessarily have simple

properties under the su (2) current algebra ( e.g they do not have to be primaries of the

su (2) current algebra ). this explains why their properties cannot be directly predicted

from the current algebra. nevertheless this line of argument should, with some modica-

tion to take into account the quantum eect of shifting k by 1, be useful in understanding

the space-time coordinate. it is also worth noting that a consistent spacetime picture re-

quires, as we argued, a q-deformation of the su (1, 1) part, whereas there is no manifest

su (1, 1) current algebra in the orbifold cft.

3.7. the ads5 case

the conjecture that nite n eects are related to gravity on a non-commutative space
has interesting consequences in the case of the duality between ads5s5 and n = 4 super-
yang mills. as we saw earlier one of the simplest consequences of the non-commutativity

is that we have to do kk reduction on a non-commutative sphere as opposed to a com-
mutative one. quantum groups also suggest a deformation of s5 as suq(3)/suq(2)[42] or

i

perhaps a deformation starting from the quotient so(6)/so(5). kk reduction on such
a space for q  e
the set of representations of su (3) that appear. in the dual gauge theory this shows up
as certain dependences between traces of powers of matrices i. we have three complex

n a root of unity will have the eect that there will be a truncation in

matrices and an su (3) action. the generating set of independent su (n ) invariant poly-

nomials which can be made from these matrices will fall in a certain set of representations

of su (3) which will have n-dependent truncations. it will be interesting to see if these
truncations are precisely the ones that appear for su (3) for a q of the form q  e

n .

23

4. summary and outlook.

we summarize here the main points developed above and outline some directions for

further research.

the stringy exclusion principle on the space of chiral primaries implies a number of
consequences for the spectrum of quantum supergravity on ads3s3. from the spacetime
point of view there are qualitatively dierent aspects of this exclusion principle. the

rst involves a restriction on the number of particles of one kind. we related this to

deformed heisenberg algebras which we computed from the orbifold cft. the second

involves an upper bound on the number of generators of the chiral ring, which are related

to single particle states in spacetime. we showed, using an explicit construction of the

chiral primaries of the orbifold cft, that this bound takes the simple form of a cuto on

the su (2) spins of the chiral primary. this bound is stronger than the bound we get from

general arguments based on the unitarity of the superconformal algebra. the precise cutos

have a simple interpretation in the context of gravity on a non-commutative deformation
of s3  ads3 to suq(2)  suq(1, 1). the hypothesis of a q-deformed spacetime with
q = e
n +1 is, therefore, more accurately predictive of the precise nature of the cutos on

i

the generators of the ring of chiral primary operators coming from the sn orbifold cft,

than general arguments based on the unitarity of the superconformal algebra, or on the

existence of an su (2) current algebra in the orbifold cft with k = n .

further work in the ads3 context is needed to understand the non-chiral primaries

and the super-algebra descendants of the chiral primaries. the hypothesis of q-deformed

spacetime explains a lot about the cutos on the superlagebra descendants of chiral pri-

maries, and uses important features about the q-deformation of the non-compact part
ads3. we expect that a q-deformation of su (1, 1|2), or perhaps an even larger algebra,
will play an interesting role in improving the spacetime understanding of the cutos. given

our explicit construction of the chiral primaries, and the remark of [8] that the non-chiral

primaries can be obtained from opes of the chiral primaries, we expect that the detailed

form of the cutos on the non-chiral primaries can be deduced directly, by generalizing the

arguments used here.

the properties of q-deformed ads3 also allowed a check that the hypothesis of q-

deformed spacetime is consistent with holography. this suggests that the relation of [37] for

correlators in a bulk theory with those of the boundary theory should admit a deformation

to the context of a non-commutative spacetime.

24

based on the idea that nite n eects are also related to a q-deformation of spacetime

we outlined a conjecture on the nite n truncations of the spectrum of chiral primary
operators in the case of the correspondence between type iib supergravity on ads5  s5
and n = 4 yang mills theory.

a recent paper of witten shows that some nite n eects can be understood in

terms of chern-simons actions. given the relation between chern simons and quantum

groups, there should be a close relation between the discussion of [37] and the remarks

on nite n eects here. a clear elucidation of this would be interesting. it would require

a better understanding of the relation between the truncations of the spectrum of chiral

primaries studied here and the t hooft uxes and wilson loop properties studied in [37].

the investigation of the relation between wilson loops and local operators of [43] should

provide a start.

it remains to use the ads/cft correspondences to learn more about the theory of

uctuating geometries in the non-commutative setting. for example it would be very
interesting to write an action for non-commutative gravity on the deformed ads3  s3
space and test its properties using the dual cft.
