1 introduction

since the discovery of the role of branes in string theory [1] they have frequently shown

unexpected properties. they were rst identied as the carriers of r-r charges and very

soon after, it was realized that when n of them merge the space-time coordinates normal to

them become noncommutative [2] and the u(n) super-yang-mills theory emerges. another

type of noncommutativity appears in the bound states of branes with fundamental strings

and with other branes. it has been shown that such brane bound states correspond to branes

with non-zero background internal gauge elds [2,3,4]. these are the type of branes we shall

be focusing on in this article. the correspondence has been demonstrated by constructing

the interaction amplitudes of two branes [4,5] and by looking at the scattering of dierent

closed strings o the branes [6]. the noncommutativity arising in the internal structure of

these brane bound states is a consequence of the properties of open strings ending on them.

such open strings satisfy boundary conditions which are neither neumann nor dirichlet,

but a combination of the two, sometimes reered to as mixed boundary condition [4,5,7].

the mixed boundary condition makes the canonical quantization of the theory non-trivial.

imposing the standard commutation relations, leads to inconsistency. it has been proposed

to remove the inconsistency by relaxing the commutativity of the space coordinates of the

open strings along the direction of the brane described by mixed boundary conditions [7,8,9].

the procedure of relaxing the commutativity of space coordinates adopted in [5,8], was to

keep the standard algebra of the fourier modes in the mode expansion.

the noncommutativity observed in the above brane system seemed very similar to that

observed by connes, douglas, schwartz (cds) [10] in the problem of matrix model with

non-trivial background three form. they studied compactication of matrix theory on a

noncommutative torus and realized that it corresponds to the matrix theory in such back-

grounds.

motivated by this observation, we showed that [7,8], the noncommutativity can be derived

within the string theory by wrapping branes with non-zero bij background eld on the
compactication torus. more over in [8] the c -algebra of functions on noncommutative
torus which is building block of the connes noncommutative geometry construction, [10,11],

was also constructed using the noncommutative open string position operators.

the bps spectrum of yang-mills theory on noncommutative torus was also originally

obtained by cds. later the spectrum of the noncommutative m(atrix)-model was derived

by taking the longitudinal and transverse membrane winding into account [12]. as another

evidence for the above correspondence, in [8,13] it was shown that the low energy bps

2

spectrum of such brane system is exactly the same as the results of [10,12].

soon after [10], another check on this correspondence was made by douglas and hull [14].

they showed that string compactication, along with wrapping a two-brane in the non-zero

two-from background, bij, in the low energy limit leads to yang-mills theory on the dual
noncommutative torus. studying the three and four open strings scattering amplitudes in

[15], the noncommutative yang-mills theory obtained as the related low energy eective eld

theory on the branes. further evidence for the correspondence of the work of cds and string

theory in a non-zero b background eld has been discussed in many papers [16]. despite
these checks which support the noncommutativity of the dierent position coordinates of

the brane with non zero background b-eld, the arguments leading to noncommutativity of

space coordinates was based on a number of assumptions which might be open to question.

the method adopted in [5,8] has been based on taking the commutation relation among the

raising and lowering operators of the open strings in absence of the b eld and imposing
the commutativity on the zero modes. on the other hand in [9] the analysis was based a

time averaged symplectic form.

in this article we will try to provide a solid ground for the quantization of this system.

since the serious obstacle in the way of quantization is the mixed boundary condition we

need to treat it carefully. we consider it as a constraint and apply the method of dirac to

nd the commutators. in the rest of the introduction we give a brief review of the related

matters, the matrix model on the noncommutative torus, the previous approaches to the

quantization of strings attached to branes with background b elds, and an outline of the

dirac method [17].

in the m(atrix)-model one considers a set of n  n bosonic hermitian matrices, x a, a =
1, ..., 9 and sixteen component spinor of so(9), , and dynamics of these matrices is given

by

i =

1

2g z d t r (cid:26) xa xa +

1

(2)2 xa<b

[x a, x b]2 +

i

2 t  

1

(2)2 t a[x a, ](cid:27).

(1.1)

m(atrix) model was conjectured to be a light cone formulation of m-theory [18]. thus,

although the theory originally involves eleven dimensions, it has nine dimensional objects as

functions of time. the above conjecture has passed many consistency checks [19], one of the

most important of them was its compactications on dierent manifolds. compactication
of the matrix coordinate x a on a circle of radius r is possible if there exist matrices u as a
part of the symmetries of (1.1) that shifts x a by r;

u x au 1 = x a + r

(1.2)

3

leaving the other coordinates and spinors unchanged. modding out the action of u is equiv-
alent to compactication . this s1 compactication leads to the string matrix theory of
dijkgraaf-verlinde-verlinde [20] which is shown to be equivalent to type iia free string

theory. compactication on higher dimensional tori is given similarly;

uixiu 1

i = xi + ri,

uixju 1

i = xj

i 6= j,

uiu 1

i = .

consistency requires that uis should commute up to a phase;

uiuj = eiij ujui.

(1.3)

(1.4)

for ordinary commutative torus uis are translation operators with ij = 0 2. if is param-
eterize the dual torus, a solution to (1.3) for ij = 0 is

xi = i 
i

+ ai(),

ui = eiiri,

(1.5)

it is easily seen that such compactication yields the yang-mills theory on the dual torus.

the major step taken by cds, [10], was to realize that non-zero, irrational ij leads to
compactication on a noncommutative torus , and the solution to (1.3) at the limit of large

n describes a yang-mills theory on the dual noncommutative torus in which we have to

replace the denition of commutators with the moyal brackets:

{a, b} = a  b  b  a,

(1.6)

a  b() = ei( 

1 

2  

2 

1 )a()b()|==.

non-zero ij leads to non-locality in the gauge theory and break down of lorentz invariance.
this has led to a line of investigation on moyal gauge theories [21]. in their original work

cds attempt to identify physical sources of noncommutativity and suggest that it is due to

non-zero cij, the three form as a background, when one formulates the m-theory on the
light cone.

2due to sl(2,z)-type symmetries [11] rational ij s can be mapped to an integer and hence they also

result in commutative space.

4

we will now review the two previous approaches of mixed open strings quantization. we

take the open strings having their ends on non-marginal bps bound states of p, p-2, p-4,...

branes. such bound states are represented by a non-zero static and uniform conguration

of b eld in the bulk and a eld with constant strength, f, in the brane. suppose the
brane spans a p+1 dimensional space (x 0, x 1, ...., x p) with x p+1 = x p+2 = ... = x 9 = 0.
action for the open string with its ends on this brane is [22];

s = 1

4 r d2[ ax bx gab + abb ax bx ]+

(1.7)

1

2 r d ai x i|  1

2 r d ai x i|0

where ai, i = 0, 1, ..., p is the u(1) gauge eld living on the d-brane. the symmetries of
the action includes on top of the geometric symmetries, two u(1) gauge symmetries, one of

them, which we call it -gauge symmetry, only acts on the internal eld:

ai  ai + d,

(1.8)

and this is the symmetry which raises to u(n) symmetry when n branes coincide. the

other u(1) symmetry, which we will note it by -gauge symmetry, acts on both b and ai:

b  b +   

a  a  ,

and hence the gauge invariant eld strength is

f = b  f

, f = da = [a].

(1.9)

(1.10)

the equations of motion are the same as ordinary open strings but the boundary condi-

tions at ends are neither neumann nor dirichlet but a linear combination of the two,

x  + f x  = 0 at  = 0, .

(1.11)

to quantize the theory we should rst nd the canonical conjugates of x 

p(,  ) =

s

x  (,  ) = 2(cid:18) x + b x  + a((  )  ())(cid:19).

(1.12)

an important point is the freedom in the denition of the conjugate momentum. it depends

on the choice of both u(1) gauges discussed above. therefore it suggests that the noncom-

mutativity may be an artifact of these choices. to clarify this point, in this paper, we do not

5

x the gauge and conclude that within diracs method of quantization although the non-

commutativity depends on the gauge, it is not removable by a gauge choice. the physical
quantities such as spectrum depend on the gauge invariant eld f . the gauge choice of [4,5]
and [8] which was also adopted in [9],

has no delta function singularity at the ends of the string.

in this gauge the conjugate

a = 0 or f = b,

(1.13)

momenta are

2p(,  ) =  x + fx .

(1.14)

imposing the canonical quantization conditions proves to be inconsistent and hence we have

to search for a remedy. although in [8] the concentration was on the compact case, the

arguments given there hold for the non-compact case too. the method adopted there is to

make the commutation relation of the mixed open strings modes satisfy the same algebra as

the neumann open strings.

taking

[p (,  ), p (,  )] = 0,

[x (,  ), p (,  )] = i(  ),

(1.15)

as essential commutation relations, and imposing them on the classical mixed open string

mode expansions

x  = x + p  f p  + pn6=0

ein

n (ia

2p  = m

 (p + pn6=0

we nd that

ein

n a

n cos n), m = 1  f 2,

[p, p] = 0 ,

[x, p] = 2i(m1)

,

now let us consider the x  , x  commutators,

[a

n, a

m] = 2(m1)nn+m.

(1.16)

(1.17)

[x (,  ), x (,  )] = [x, x] + 2i(m1f )( +  + xn6=0

sin n( + )).

(1.18)

the sum appeared in the above equation is

(1.19)

and hence

[x, x]

[x, x] + 4i(m1f )
[x, x] + 2i(m1f )

 =  = 

(1.20)

otherwise.

in this intuitive quantization method [x, x] is not determined and can be chosen arbitrarily.
in [8] [x, x] was chosen to be zero and hence the open strings center of mass became

noncommuting. this choice was supported by the following physical argument: to nd

out whether the space is commuting or not, we should probe it by strings, open or closed.

since the closed strings live in the bulk and not only on the branes, they will not show the

noncommutative structure of the space [6]. in a more intuitive explanation since the right

and left moving modes of closed strings contribute equally in the probing processes, the

noncommutativity seen by the left movers cancel those of right movers and so the space

probed by closed strings is commutative. when we use the mixed open strings as probes

because of asymmetry in the left and right modes, the space seen by such strings is

noncommuting. and the related physical quantity which shows the space noncommutativity

is the center of mass coordinates.

in another quantization approach, authors of [9] tried to x the arbitrariness of [x, x].

they proposed to use the time averaged symplectic form:
i
n

1
2{mdp(dx +

2fdp)} + xn>0

nd
(mda

n).

this method leads to

plugging (1.22) into (1.20), they obtained

[x, x] = 2i(m1f ).

[x (,  ), x (,  )] =

2i(m1f ), for  =  = 0
2i(m1f ), for  =  = 

0

otherwise.




(1.21)

(1.22)

(1.23)

in other words, they concluded that mixed open strings are noncommutating only at the
ends, where open strings are attached to the brane, i.e.  =  = 0 ,  =  = , and the

center of mass coordinates are commuting.

7

to settle the question of the seat of noncommutativity in a more fundamental point

of view, since the problem arises from the boundary conditions which can be treated as

constraints, we take the diracs quantization method to analyze the problem [17], which we

will now outline:

suppose we take a system with the canonical position and momenta (qi, pi); i = 1, ..., n
and assume that they are constrained to lie on the hyper-surfaces m(q, p) = 0 , m = 1, ..., r.
in studying this system we face two problems;

i) the hamiltonian is not well-dened and can be modied by adding a linear combination

of the constraints; and

ii) the dynamics may not respect the constraints.

in the diracs method both diculties are resolved. first, if the constraints are violated

under time evolution, by taking the poisson bracket of hamiltonian and the constraints, we

may construct a larger set of constraints which are consistent with dynamics. furthermore

the freedom in the hamiltonian may also be xed by this consistency. the nal step to

construct the dirac brackets is to check the consistency of the constraints, i.e. consider the

poisson brackets of the constraints. if they turn out to be zero, the constraints are called

rst class and they are consequence of symmetries of the system.

if it happens that the

constraints have non-vanishing poisson brackets, and the matrix of their brackets is non-

singular, the second class constraints, dirac denes the quantum commutator in terms of

a modied poisson bracket, i.e. dirac bracket. it is interesting that in the case of second

class constraints we can nd a new set of canonical variables in which the constraints are

practically decoupled from the physical degrees of freedom [23,24] and the poisson brackets

of the new set of variables are the same as dirac brackets. we take the boundary conditions

as constraints and follow the procedure described above. the constraints are of second class.

we nd that the coordinates at the ends points of the strings are noncommutative . the

exact value of the commutators depend on the -gauge we choose, but as we can see from
its expression given below, is non-zero in any gauge 3;

[x i(0,  ), x j(0,  )] =

2i
c

(2fm  2f ff )ij.

(1.24)

this is unlike the commutators of the momenta which can be set to zero for all string points

in the gauge f = 0. this gauge is particularly useful since the mixed open strings momentum

distribution does not possess delta function singularity at the end of the string.

3 we will present the calculations in section 4.

8

in section 2, we review the method of dirac quantization in detail. in section 3, we apply

it to the well-known cases of d-branes and show the equivalence of the dirac method and

the usual mode expansion and quantizing the fourier modes. in section 4, applying diracs

method to the case of non-zero background antisymmetric eld, i.e.

the case of mixed

boundary conditions, we show that despite gauge dependence, the noncommutativity is not

removable. in the diracs prescription, unlike the mode expansion method, the boundary

conditions at two ends of open strings appear independently, so we can consider the strings

with their ends on the same or dierent branes. in this section , we also compare our results

with the previous methods, and argue that in a gauge in which the internal u(1) eld is set

to zero, the results of dirac quantization agree with the mode expansion method provided

we set the commutators of the center of mass coordinates to zero. the last section is devoted

to conclusions and discussions.

2 review of dirac quantization

according to principles of quantum mechanics, to quantize a mechanical system a hamilto-

nian formulation of the system is needed, i.e. a hamiltonian and a poisson bracket structure.

having these two we can nd the dynamics of any function dened on the phase space of the

theory, and to go over to the quantized theory we should replace the poisson bracket with

the commutators. but, in general, when the theory is subject to constraints, i.e. when all

of the phase space is not available for the motion, the hamiltonian formulation should be

modied. dirac has given a concise recipe to handle these constrained systems [17], which

we briey review here.

given a hamiltonian, h, and a set of primary constraints, m(q, p) = 0, since any linear
combination of the constraints is also zero, the hamiltonian is not uniquely determined and

ht = h + umm is as good as h, um being arbitrary functions in phase space. dynamics
of any function in phase space, g(q, p), is determined by the poisson bracket structure,

g  {g, ht}p.b.,

(2.1)

the symbol  called weak equivalence implying that, the poisson brackets should be worked
out and then the constraints imposed, thus

m  0.

9

(2.2)

consistent dynamics requires that the constraints remain valid under time evolution:

m  {m, ht}p.b.  {m, h} + un{m, n}  0.

(2.3)

there are then three possibilities

i) the equation (2.3) reduces to 0 = 0, i.e.

identically satised with the imposition of

the primary constraints.

ii) they reduce to equations independent of us, thus involving only qs and ps. such

equations must be independent of the primary constraints, otherwise they would be of the

rst kind, thus they are a new set of constraints:

i(q, p) = 0.

(2.4)

iii) the equations (2.3) may not reduce in either of these ways; they then may be solved

in terms of the us.

equations obtained from the kind ii), (2.4), are called secondary constraints. if a sec-

ondary constraint turns up, then their consistency with the time evolution should still be

worked out:

i  {i, ht}p.b.  0.

(2.5)

these equations should be treated on the same footing as (2.3), and the analysis should be

repeated. the procedure should be pursued until there are no more secondary constraints

and we have exhausted all the consistency conditions. finally we will be left with a number

of secondary constraints and a number of conditions on us. the secondary constraints, for

many purposes should be treated on the same footing as the primary ones; e.g. , in evaluating

the weak equations they should be imposed after calculating the poisson brackets. so for an

arbitrary constraint, (q, p), primary or secondary:

{i, ht}p.b.  0.

(2.6)

there is a more important classication of constraints:

a constraint is called rst class, if its poisson bracket with all other constraints vanishes, a

well-known example of which is the electromagnetic eld [23]. first class constraints arise

from symmetries of the action which in the electromagnetic case is the gauge invariance.

the second class constraints are those with a non-zero and non-singular poisson brackets,

{m , n}p.b.  cm n ,

(2.7)

with det c 6= 0.

10

according to dirac, to quantize a system with second class constraints, the commutators

of any two functions on the phase space should be given in terms of a modied bracket,

dirac bracket,

where

[a, b] = i{a, b}d.b.,

{a, b}d.b. = {a, b}p.b.  {a, m}p.b. (c 1)m n{n , b}p.b..

(2.8)

(2.9)

one can easily verify that the dirac bracket satises the algebraic relations of the poisson

bracket. the important property of the dirac bracket is that for an arbitrary a and for all

constraints m

so, using the dirac brackets instead of poisson bracket, the weak equations may be written

{, a}d.b. = 0.

(2.10)

as strong equalities.

for second class constraints we can always nd a canonical transformation which maps the

set of the constrained variables, q, p ,  = 1, ..., n, and the constraints m , , m = 1, ..., n,
to a set qi, pi; m , i = 1, .., n n, , such that m = 0 identically, and q, p are unconstrained
[24], i.e.

{a, b}d.b. = {a, b}p.b.in terms of q,p =

a
qi

b
pi 

b
qi

a
pi

.

(2.11)

the set of (q, p ) span the reduced phase space, and it has been shown that the quantization

on this reduced phase space with the canonical commutators is equivalent to the dirac

quantization on the constrained phase space.

3 boundary conditions as dirac constraints

in this section, having equipped ourselves with the dirac bracket, we return to the problem

of quantization of usual open strings which in the simplest case is governed by

s =

1

4 z (( x i)2  (x i)2)dd.

(3.1)

variation of the above action reduces to the equations of motion: 2
x i and the
neumann boundary conditions, x i|0, = 0. treating the boundary conditions as the
dirac constraints, we try to quantize the theory directly by means of the dirac method,

 x i = 2

without recourse to the mode expansions. our point of view here, treating the boundary

conditions as constraints, will be justied and discussed in more detail in a later work [25].

11

the total hamiltonian of the open strings is

h =

1

4 z (( x i)2 + (x i)2)dd + uix i|0 or,

with the canonical momenta

2p i(,  ) =  x i.

(3.2)

(3.3)

and the primary constraints: i  x i|0 = 0. the boundary conditions at the other end
of the string ( = ) can be worked out similarly.

now, the consistency of the constraints,

{i, h}p.b. = 2p i|0,

(3.4)

gives a new set of constraints; and therefore it is of the ii) kind. calling them i, we can go
on

and nd an equation for ui and hence end up with the constraints (i, i). since the poisson
brackets of the constraints are not zero, we are dealing with second class constraints,

{i, h}p.b.  0,

{i, j}p.b. = 0 ,
{i, j}p.b. = {x i|0, p j|0}p.b. = r 

{i, j}p.b. = 0

(3.5)

0 {x i(), p i()}p.b.()()dd.

to overcome the diculty of dealing with the delta function derivatives at the boundaries,
we discretize , denoting the steps by , and take the   0 at the end; thus

with the discrete lagrangian conjugate momenta:

i =

1


(x i

1  x i
0).

2p i

0 =  x i

0 , 2p i

1 =  x i
1.

the x i

n, p i

n, n = 0, 1 have the usual poisson brackets

m} = 0,
m} = 0

n, x j

{x i
{p i

n, p j

{x i

m} = ijmn.

12

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

the secondary constraints in the discretized version are

i = p i

hence

{i, j}p.b. =

(3.10)

ij.

it should be emphasized that, we use the discrete language only as a method for calculating
the commutators and at the end the objects surviving in the   0 limit are physical.
the c matrix takes the form

,

(3.11)




0 2

and is invertible. for simplicity and to visualize how the dirac method goes through, let us
take the boundary conditions only on one of x is. in this case c is a 2  2 matrix and

c 1 =


2




0  1

.




(3.12)

to quantize the theory we calculate the dirac brackets and nd

{x i(), x j()}d.b. = 0  {x i(), m}p.b. (c 1)m n{n , x i()}p.b. = 0.

(3.13)

the dirac bracket for two p i()s similarly vanishes, but {x i(), p j()}d.b. will have a
slightly dierent form near the boundary, i.e. at ,  = 0,  which can be removed by
normalizing x and p by a factor of 2. the above dirac brackets can be understood in
terms of maskawa-nakajima theorem, [24] too. we can easily nd the reduced phase space

and the unconstrained variables, which are

x i =

x i

1 + x i
0

2

, p i = p i

1 + p i
0,

and the identically vanishing constraints:

x i
1  x i

0

, p i

1  p i
0.

comparing the method we used here with the usual open strings quantization based on

the mode expansion, we nd that in the mode expansion method, to impose the boundary

conditions, we put coecients of the sine terms in the expansion equal to zero. this is

13

equivalent to considering the secondary constraints and also going to the reduced phase

space, and performing the quantization on these unconstrained set of variables. hence in

the neumann boundary conditions, the mode expansion quantization and the dirac method

give the same quantum theory.

one can similarly apply the dirac bracket method to the strings with dirichlet boundary

conditions. again there are secondary constraints and the c matrix is invertible, giving
{x i(), x j()}d.b. = 0, {p i(), p j()}d.b. = 0. the reduced phase space is the one on
which the x0, p0 are both omitted, which is again the same as what we have in the mode
expansions; there we only choose the sine, which is equivalent to working in the reduced

phase space.

4 dirac quantization for mixed boundary conditions

in this section we consider a more general case, the open strings with mixed boundary condi-
tions. let us take the open strings ending on a p-brane which is spanned by x 0, x 1, ..., x p,
assuming that we have turned on a constant b (,  = 0, ..., p) background and also we
have a constant f ending on the brane. as explained earlier since the background b is
constant, it does not appear in the equation of motion and only appears in the boundary

conditions

 x  = 2
2

x ,

x  + f x  = 0 at  = 0, .

(4.1)

the above equations enjoy two u(1) symmetries explained earlier and hence the solution of
them also have these symmetries. calculating the conjugate momenta of x 

2p (,  ) =  x  + b

 x  + a(()  (  )),

(4.2)

we see that the momentum is not gauge invariant under either of these u(1)s. the u(1)

acting only on a, is similar to the familiar electrodynamics gauge symmetry and at the end

survives in our quantized theory. hence by choosing a gauge, we x the u(1) which only
acts on a eld (1.8). for constant f,  can be chosen so that

a = 1
2

f x .

(4.3)

to quantize the theory, we consider the mixed boundary conditions as constraints and quan-

tize the system by the dirac method. running the dirac machinery rst we should build

14

the hamiltonian from the action:

4 z (( x )2 + (x )2)d.

(4.4)

 x  are related to momenta through (4.2). we will put 2 equal to one and reintroduce
in our results at the end. without loss of generality, we assume the electric mixing, i.e.
f0, b0 to be zero. the boundary conditions, or in other words, the primary constraints
are

i = x i + fij x j|=0

or  = 0.

i, j = 1, 2, ..., p.

(4.5)

here the calculations are presented explicitly only for  = 0; for the other end ( = ),

which is very similar to  = 0, we only give the results.

according to dirac prescription, we should verify if there are any other constraints:

{i, ht}p.b. = z 

0 {x i() + fij x j(), h}()d + uj{i, j}p.b..

(4.6)

the {i, j}p.b. in the above is ill-dened; hence the two terms should vanish independently;
which leads to secondary constraints [25].

to avoid the ambiguities due to () derivatives, we use the discretized form of the

strings:

which are not invariant under -gauge transformation (1.9) explicitly. we must also check

if there is any more constraints; this should be done with the total hamiltonian which is
obtained by adding i with some lagrange multipliers ui to the h (4.4). and we nd that
there are no other secondary constraints.

15

at this stage following dirac, the class of the constraints should be determined;

aij  {i, j}p.b. = 2f ikmkj + f ikf klf lj,

bij  {i, j}p.b. = 2mij + 2f ikf kj,

{i, j} = fij

mij = (1  f 2)ij.

(4.11)

(4.12)

with

since the poisson brackets of constraints are non-zero we may be dealing with second class

constraints; to check that and to quantize the system we should nd the c matrix, the
in the general p-brane case c is a 2p  2p matrix

poisson brackets of the constraints.

composed of a, b, f matrices dened in (4.11):

c =

a b






detc = det(af + bbt).

bt  f

.

(4.13)

(4.14)

the above determinant, like the c itself, is -gauge dependent, but in any gauge, for real

, (4.14) is non-zero and hence, c for any choice of the gauge is invertible. therefore the

constraints are in fact second class. to visualize how the dirac method works, without loss
of generality, we conne ourselves to the d2-brane, i.e. p = 2, in which c is a 4  4 matrix.
we are now ready to calculate the basic dirac brackets:

0, x j

{x i

0}d.b. =

1
c

(2fm  2f ff )ij,

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

(f ff )ij,

{x i
1
c

0, x j

{x i

0}d.b. =

(2fm  2f ff )ij = {x i

0, x j

0}d.b..

dirac brackets of x i for any point in the middle of the string are zero.

the important and new result we obtain here is that the dirac brackets are not gauge

invariant, and each of (4.15) or (4.16) could be set to zero by a gauge transformation. but,

there is no gauge in which both of these brackets vanish.

16

the quantum theory is obtained by replacing the dirac brackets with icommutators,
(4.18)

[x i

1, x j

1] =

(2fm  2f ff )ij,

0, x j

0] = [x i

i
c

[x i

0, x j

1] =

i
c

(f ff )ij.

(4.19)

in other words the open strings coordinates along which bij and fij have a non-zero value,
become noncommuting, and the noncommutativity being gauge dependent, but not remov-

able. one can go further and calculate the dirac brackets of x, p and p , p which we will

not do it here.

a special gauge which has been discussed earlier in [8,9] is:

in this gauge commutators take a simpler form

f = 0 or b = f .

[x i

0, x j

0] = [x i
[x i

0, x j

1] = 0,

1, x j

1] = i

and

[x i

2 ij(n0 + n1)(m0 + m1),

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

[p i

n, p j

m] = 0.

in the last part of this section we will compare our results in this gauge (f = 0) with the

previous works, based on the mode expansions.

boundary conditions at  = 

to discuss the noncommutativity of open strings center of mass we should also consider

the boundary conditions at the other end of the open string. there are some choices: the

boundary conditions can be neumann, dirichlet or mixed with the same or dierent mixing
parameter, f 
ij. the open strings with mixed boundary conditions at one end ( = 0), and
neumann (dirichlet) at the other end ( = ) are reered to as m n (m d) strings, and the

open strings with mixed boundary conditions at both ends but with dierent (or the same)
mixing parameters, m m  (m m). the rst two cases, m n and m d, happen when a mixed
p-brane is parallel to a dp-brane and dp2-brane respectively [5]. m m strings appear when
the open string has both ends on the same mixed brane.

17

to study the most general case we consider the m m  strings which recovers the m m,
m d and m n as special cases. since the calculations are very similar to what we have done

earlier, we will only quote the results here

where detc , has the same form of detc (4.14), with f replaced by f , the mixing parameter
at  = . equations (4.23-25) compared to similar results at  = 0, (4.15-17), has an extra

minus sign. this can be understood intuitively noting that the open strings attached to

branes are oriented open strings.

noncommutativity of open string center of mass

for m m  strings discussed above the commutator of the center of mass coordinates,

is found to be

(4.26)

which is in general -gauge dependent. but, in the important special case when the open

string has both ends on the same mixed brane (m m string), the noncommutativity at the

ends of these oriented open strings cancel each other and the center of mass commutators

therefore vanishes and is not gauge dependent. in the other special cases, m n and m d

open strings, we can choose a gauge (f = 0) in which the center of mass coordinates are

commuting [5].

the noncommutativity of m m open string components was rst observed in [7], and in

a more detailed work discussed in [8], and later in [9]. in the introduction we noted that

the quantization methods used in [8] and [9], both based on the string mode expansions,

and by the choice (1.22) are exactly equal. in this part we compare the results of the dirac

quantization method, with the previous works.

in order to make this comparison the dirac method results should be rewritten in the spe-

cial -gauge, (4.20), which leads to (4.21), (4,22) and also be translated into the continuum

18

language:

x i
0 = x i(,  )|=0
p i
0 = p i(,  )|=0

, x i

1 = x i

0 + x i|=0
0 + p i|=0,

,

p i

1 = p i

(4.27)

and the similar relations at  = . inserting these into (4.21,23) and reintroducing the 2
factor, we obtain

[x i(,  )|=0, x j(,  )|=0] = [x i(,  )|=, x j(,  )|=] = i(fm1)ij,

(4.28)

[x i|=0, x j|=0] = 0,

and for the x, p commutators,

2 ij,

[x i|=0, p j|=0] = 1
[x i|=0, p j|=0] = 0,
[x i|=0, p j|=0] = 0,

[p i|=0, p j|=0] = 0.

(4.29)

(4.30)

and also

[x i|=0, x j|=0] in the   0 (continuum limit) is not nite, and tends to innity as 1
 .
comparing the diracs method results, (4.28) with (1.23), one nds that in (4.28) there is

a factor of 2 missing. but, we should notice the (x, p ) commutators, to set the normalization.
according to (4.29), both x and p should be normalized by a factor 2, to get the usual
commutators, taking this 2 factor into account leads to the missing 2 in the diracs results.
[x, x], [x, p ], [x, p ], [p, p ], can be worked out
the other commutators, i.e.
in the mode expansion method. doing so, which is a straight-forward calculus, we nd the

same results in both methods, the diracs and the mode expansion. one can go further and

nd all the related commutators of mode expansion quantization from the dirac method by

considering the general , not only 0 and , which we will not enter it here.

thus we see that the quantization methods based on mode expansion, [8] and [9], which

are based on certain ad-hoc assumptions agree with the more fundamental one, the dirac

quantization procedure.

5 conclusions and discussions

we have tackled the problem of the noncommutativity of the internal coordinates of brane

starting from the basis principles of dirac quantization. we found that in spite of a large

class of gauge symmetries, and gauge dependence of the form and location of the noncom-

mutativity of the open strings attached to the brane in the presence of constant background

antisymmetric eld, there is no gauge in which the noncommutativity can be removed, i.e.,

noncommutativity of the coordinates of the open string-brane system is intrinsic. as the

gauge changes, the location of the noncommutativity shifts, but it never goes away alto-

gether.

we discussed that, choosing the mixed boundary condition at one end, there are various

choices for the boundary condition at the other end of open strings; it can be neumann,

dirichlet, and mixed with the same or dierent mixing parameters, reered to as m n, m d,
m m and m m  respectively. and showed that except for the m m case, the center of mass
coordinates of these open strings are noncommuting but -gauge dependent, in a way that

this center of mass noncommutativity can be removed in a certain gauge.

the m m case physically describes the open strings having both ends on a mixed brane.

for this case we showed that, although the open string end points are not commuting and

this noncommutativity is -gauge dependent, the center of mass coordinates are commuting

which is a gauge independent result.

having obtained the connes noncommutative structure as an inherent property of string

theory on certain branes, many open questions can be addressed. the noncommutativity ar-

guments based on mixed open strings quantization holds in both compact and non-compact
branes. in the compact case [8], we showed that the c -algebra of the functions on non-

commutative torus can be constructed through the open string zero modes. however, in

the non-compact case, in spite of having noncommutative coordinates, since these functions
are not normalizable, there is no c -algebra structure. in this case the brane is a moyal
plane. it is shown [14,15] that the internal low energy eective theory living in this moyal

plane is noncommutative super yang-mills theory described by moyal brackets [10]. renor-

malizability of this theory, which has been checked up to one loop, is a question should be

answered.

the other problem can be addressed is the dynamics of branes in noncommutative back-

grounds. in a special case, zero-branes on a noncommutative two-torus, it has been proposed

to be a light cone formulation of m-theory with a non-zero three form; a generalization of

matrix-model conjecture. but, there are some suggestions that the born-infeld corrections to

20

the yang-mills are not suppressed in the large n limit, unlike the commutative case. hence

to have a proper formulation of matrix-theory, born-infeld action on the noncommutative

background should be considered and all the matrix-theory arguments should be repeated for

the noncommutative born-infeld, some of which has been considered by hofman-verlinde.

another interesting open problem is the anomalous u(1) symmetry. according to our

explicit calculations the -gauge symmetry, the internal u(1) gauge symmetry which raises

to u(n) for the n coincident branes, survives in the quantized theory. but, the other u(1),

the -symmetry, breaks at the quantum level. it seems that the supersymmetry arguments

can help to understand this anomaly. resolving this problem may shed light on the problem

of u(n) born-infeld theory which is expected to have this -symmetry.
