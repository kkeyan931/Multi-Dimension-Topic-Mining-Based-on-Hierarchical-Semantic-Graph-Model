abstract

in the type 0b string theory, we discuss the role of tachyon(t ) and xed

scalars(, ). the issue is to explain the dierence between tachyon and xed

scalars in the d5-d1 black hole background. for this purpose, we perform

the semiclassical calculation. here one nds a mixing between (, , t ) and the

other elds. using the decoupling procedure, one nds the linearized equation

for the tachyon. from the potential analysis, it turns out that  plays a role

of test eld well, while the tachyon induces an instability of minkowski space

vacuum. but the roles of  and t are the same in the near-horizon geometry.

finally we discuss the stability problem.

i. introduction

recently type 0 string theories attract much interest in the study of non-supersymmetric

gauge theories [13]. type 0 string theories can be obtained from the worldsheet of type ii

string theories by performing a non-chiral gso projection [4]. the resulting theories have

world sheet supersymmetry but no space-time supersymmetry. the crucial dierences of

type 0 theories with type ii theories is to have the doubling of ramond-ramond(rr) elds

and the tachyon. thus they all have twice as many d-branes. the application of this model

to the study of non-susy gauge theory was realized by klebanov and tseytlin [2]. they

considered the theory of n coincident electrically charged d3-branes. using the near-horizon

d3-brane, they constructed an su(n) gauge theory with six adjoint scalars and studied its

behavior. they observed that the doubled rr ux in type 0 dual background stabilizes the

tachyon. since then a number of papers on this mode appeared [5]. in a subsequent paper,

klebanov and tseytlin [6] also considered the theory of n electric d3+-branes coincident

with n magnetic d3-branes. the non-susy theory is the su(n)su(n) gauge theory
coupled to six adjoint scalars of the rst su(n), six adjoint scalars of the second su(n), and

fermions in the bifundamental representation(four weyl spinors in the (n, n) and another

four in the ( n,n)). the dp-brane bound states of the type 0 theories are somewhat similar

to those of the type ii theories. however, the essential dierence with type ii theories comes

from the existence of tachyon. in the previous work of one of the authors [7], the low energy

scattering of elds in the type 0b theory for electric d3-branes attepmted. in this analysis

the dilaton eld can be used as a test eld.

one of the simplest way to see the role of tachyon in type 0 theories is to consider the

intersecting dp-branes. the dp-brane bound states can be intersected according to the

same rules of the type ii theories. the d5-d1 brane black hole thus is constructed to show
that the corresponding near-horizon geometry is ads3s3t4 and it has asymptotically at
space at innity. it is shown that the tachyon eld can be stabilized in ads3s3t4 [6,8]. in
this paper, we will study the role of the tachyon in d5-d1 brane black hole, by comparing

2

it with the xed scalars. further, we will present a complete solution to the stability by

analyzing the potentials surrounding the d5-d1 brane black hole.

the organization of the paper is as follows. in section ii, we briey sketch the d5-d1

brane black hole in the type 0b string theory. we set up the perturbation for all elds

around this black hole background in sec. iii. here we choose the harmonic gauge and use

all linearized equations to decouple (, t) from the remaining elds. sec. iv is devoted to

analyzing their potentials. finally we discuss our results in sec. v.

ii. d5-d1 brane black hole

here we consider a class of 5d black holes representing the bound state of the d5-
d1 brane system compactied on t5(=t4s1). this black hole can also be obtained as
a solution to the semiclassical action of type 0b string compactied on t5. the eective

action for a 5d black hole is given by [8]

is the kaluza-klein(kk) eld strength along the string direction(s1), f are

the electric components of the ramond-ramond(rr) three-form f3 and h are dual to

the magnetic components of the rr three-form f3. here we omit the analysis of the 6d

dilaton 6, since it is just a minimally decoupled scalar. on the other hand, the scalars 

and  interact with the gauge elds and are examples of the xed scalar.  is related to the

scale of the internal torus(t4), while  is related to the scale of the kk circle(s1). f(t ) =
1 t +o(t 2) and the tachyon mass is given by m2 = 2/. comparing with the results of
type iib theory [9,10], the new ingredients are the tachyon and the doubling of the rr elds.

the background metric (12) is just a 5d schwarzschild one with time and space com-

ponents rescaled by dierent powers of f . the event horizon (outer horizon) is clearly at

r = r0. when all ve charges are nonzero, the surface of r = 0 becomes a smooth inner hori-

zon (cauchy horizon). if one of the charges is zero, the surface of r = 0 becomes singular.

the extremal case corresponds to the limit of r0  0 with the boost parameters i  
keeping qi xed. here one has q1 = r2
k. in this work we are very
interested in the limit of r0, rk  r1, r5, which is called the dilute gas approximation. this
corresponds to the near-extremal black hole and its thermodynamic quantities are given by

iii. perturbation analysis

here we start with the perturbation around the black hole background as in [10]

tr

tr = f (k)

tr + f (k)

[1 + f (k)(t, r, , , )],

tr = f (k)
f (k)
ftr = ftr + ftr = ftr[1 + f(t, r, , , )],
htr = htr + htr = htr[1 + h(t, r, , , )],
 =  + (t, r, , , ),

 =  + (t, r, , , ),

g = g + h,

t = 0 + t.

here h is given by

we wish to point out that (, t)-equations are decoupled completely but -equation still

remains a coupled form. in this sense the role of  remains obscure. hence we no longer

consider this eld. here we observe from (48) and (50) that if the mass term in (50) is

absent, two equations are exactly the same form.

iv. potential analysis

from the bianchi identities (11) one has

9

f (k) = f (k) = f (k) = 0,
f = f = f = 0,
h = h = h = 0.

(51)

this implies either f (k) = f (k)(t, r),f = f(t, r),h = h(t, r) or f (k) = f = h =
0. the former together with (45)-(47) means that all higher modes of l  1 are forbidden in
this scheme. hence we consider only the s-wave(l=0) propagations. then the relevant elds

become (r, t) = (r)eit and t(r, t) = t(r)eit, but the graviton modes h are irrelevant

we note that vn depends on two parameters (r0, r) as well as the energy(). as (54)

stands, it is far from the schrodinger-type equation. the -dependence is a matter of

peculiar interest to us compared with the schwarzschild black hole potentials (vrw , vz, v)

[14,15]. this makes the interpretation of vn as a potential dicult. this arises because
(f  1) is very large as 106 for r0 = 0.01, r = 0.3 in the near-horizon. in order for vn to
be a potential, it is necessary to take the low energy limit of   0. it is suitable to be
103. and 2(f  1) is of order o(1) and thus it can be ignored in comparison with the
remaing ones. now we can dene a potential vn = vn + 2(f  1). hence, in the low energy
limit(  0), eq.(54) becomes as the schrodinger-type equation.

first we consider the near-horizon geometry, which corresponds to the limit of r  r0
such that the dilute gas limit (r  r0) holds. in this limit one nds ads3s3t4. in the
near-horizon, as is shown in fig. 1, the potential of the xed scalar(v(r)) takes exactly the

same form of the tachyon(vt(r)). this means that in the near-horizon the roles of the xed

11

scalar() and the tachyon(t ) are the same. now let us observe the far-region behavior of

their potentials. in the asymptotic region(r  r) v approaches to zero, whereas vt goes
to 2(see fig. 2). with vt one nds an exponentially growing mode (eit,  = i) from
eq. (54) [15]. this implies that  plays a role of the good test eld, while t induces an

instability of the at space.

v. discussions

let us rst discuss the role of a xed scalar  in the greybody factor calculation(hawking

radiation). although  is related to the scale of t 4, it turns out to be the 10d dilaton(10)

when 6 = 10  2 = 0. for q1 = q5 case, one nds the same linearized equation for the
harmonic, dilaton gauge, and k-k setting [10]. this means that the xed scalar() gives us

a gauge-invariant result. in the low energy limit (  0), the s-wave semiclassical greybody
factor takes the form [13]

12

abs = ah


r(cid:19)4
4 (cid:18)r0

.

(58)

on the other hand, (= 5  6/2) is entirely determined by the scale(5) of the kk
circle(s1) when 6 is turned o. the semiclassical result of its greybody factor takes the

form


abs =

9

r(cid:19)4
4ah (cid:18)r0

.

(59)

however, in the previous work [10] we found out that  depends on the gauge choice. the

xed scalar  is clearly understood as a good test eld for studying the d5-d1 brane

black hole. on the other hand, the role of  as a test eld is obscure because it is a gauge-

dependent eld and gives rise to some disagreement for the cross section. the tachyon plays

the same role of  in the near-horizon geometry. but this induces an instability of minkowski

space(see fig. 2). hence the tachyon seems not to be a good test eld to investigate the

quantum aspect of the d5-d1 brane black hole.

finally let us comment on the stability problem of the near-horizon geometry.

it is
known that while the minkowski vacuum is unstable in type 0 string theory, the ads5s5
with self-dual 5-form ux should be a stable background for suciently small radius [6,8].

the rr elds work to stabilize the tachyon in the near-horizon. it is clear from fig. 1 that
the ads3s3t4 is stable because v(r) and vt(r) take the shapes of the potential barrier.
from eq.(44), if there do not exist the rr elds (f,h), one nds a potential well for the
tachyon, which induces an instability in the near-horizon [14]. however, thanks to the rr

elds, one obtains a potential barrier. this shows obviously that the rr elds can work to

stabilize the tachyon in the near-horizon.
