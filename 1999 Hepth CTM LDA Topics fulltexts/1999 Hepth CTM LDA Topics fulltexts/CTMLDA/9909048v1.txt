abstract

we construct a model consisting of many d3-branes with only positive tension in a

ve-dimensional anti-de sitter space-time geometry. it is shown that this type of model

naturally realizes not only exponential mass hierarchy between the planck scale and the

electroweak scale but also trapping of the graviton on the d3-branes. it is pointed out

that our model may have a exibility to explain the existence of more than one disparate

mass scales, such as the electroweak scale and the gut scale, on the same d3-brane.

1 introduction

understanding the hierarchy problem of the standard model in four dimensions is a classic and
important problem. the main ideas for this problem have been so far focused on improvement
of particle physics sector around the tev scale. recently, however, motivated by studies
of non-perturbative superstring theory and m-theory, a completely new proposal for the
hierarchy problem has been made in gravity sector where the huge planck scale is reduced all
the way to the tev scale by assuming the existence of extra dimensions [1, 2, 3].

in particular, randall and sundrum have considered a solution for the ve-dimensional
einstein equation with the cosmological constant and two 3-branes [3, 4]. this solution
involves a red-shift (or warp) factor in the metric tensor, which was found to play a
critical role in explaining the vast disparity between the planck scale and the electroweak
scale in a natural way [3]. subsequently, they proposed an alternative scenario for trapping
of gravity [4].

here it is worth summarizing basic setups and aims of the two papers [3, 4] since they
have proposed two distinct new scenarios in terms of the same solution as stated above. in
both the papers, two 3-branes, in other words, domain walls, are placed at the boundaries of
the fth dimension, which are the xed points of an orbifold s1/z2, in the ve-dimensional
anti-de sitter space-time [5, 6]. the one 3-brane with positive brane tension is located at the
origin of the fth dimension while the other 3-brane with opposite brane tension to the rst
3-brane is located at another xed point away from the origin at some distance. note that
one has to make such a ne-tuning of brane tensions to obtain the randall-sundrum solution
for the einstein equation. (this issue will be argued in some detail around the end of section
2.)

in the rst paper [3], our universe is assumed to the 3-brane with negative tension whereas
the other 3-brane with positive tension is regarded as hidden universe. if we think that a
natural scale on the hidden world is of order the planck scale, the electroweak scale is generated
on our universe from the red-shift factor by selecting rather small size of an extra dimension.
thus, the purpose of the paper is to present a resolution to the hierarchy problem.

on the other hand, in the second paper [4], the model setup is converse compared to
that in the rst paper [3]. that is, our universe is assumed to the 3-brane with positive
tension at the origin whereas the other 3-brane with negative tension is regarded as hidden
universe. moreover, the 3-brane with negative tension is moved to innity, thus providing an
example of a non-compact extra dimension. a remarkable thing here is that even without
mass gap between the massless graviton and the continuous kaluza-klein spectrum, the four-
dimensional newtons law is reproduced to more than adequate precision on our universe,
thereby implying the trapping of gravity on our universe. the reason why the 3-brane with
positive tension is taken to be our universe is that the 3-brane with positive tension supplies
us with the -function potential with a negative coecient supporting the massless graviton,
which will be discussed in section 4. of course, in this setup, we cannot solve the hierarchy
problem.

from these considerations, it is natural to ask whether one can construct a model with

1

the same geometry as in the randall-sundrum metric solution such that problems of mass
hierarchy and trapping of gravity on our 3-brane universe are simultaneously solved. indeed,
in a recent work [7], lykken and randall have explored such a possibility by considering a
model including only 3-branes with positive tension. their setup is similar to that in the
second paper [4], but is distinct in that the setup includes more than one positive tension 3-
brane. but it is unclear at least for the present author that introduction of many 3-branes with
positive tension in addition to a single 3-brane with negative tension (regulator brane) in
the setup is consistent with the einstein equation. one of motivations in this paper is to show
explicitly that the above setup is indeed compatible with the einstein equation. however,
to do so, at the outset we need to introduce the same number of negative tension 3-branes
as positive tension 3-branes into a model, and after that we have to take a suitable limit in
order to move negative tension 3-branes to innity. of course, in an extreme case where all
the negative tension 3-branes are coincident, our model would become equivalent to that of
lykken and randall.

the other motivations behind the study at hand are as follows. in this paper, we make
use of solutions satisfying the einstein equation, which were found in our previous work [8].
as stated in the paper, these new solutions describe many domain walls standing along the
fth dimension with topology s1 in ve-dimensional anti-de sitter space-time, so they realize
many universe cosmology. but these solutions involve the same number of positive tension
3-branes as negative tension 3-branes, thus as a result, the total number of 3-branes are only
even. it is quite unfair and against democracy that only even universes can exist in such a
model. it will be shown later that we can construct a more plausible model with any number
of d3-branes with positive tension by moving negative tension o3-planes to innity.

another important motivation of this study is relevant to a recent interesting work by di-
enes et al [9]. in their paper, some phenomenological diculties associated with the randall-
sundrum scenario and its extension were pointed out and possible resolutions to these puzzles
are speculated. specially, they have concluded that in the randall-sundrum model we can-
not simultaneously generate the planck/electroweak hierarchy (mass hierarchy) and explain
gauge coupling unication. this conclusion is physically sensible, of course, as in the original
randall-sundrum model, there exists only a single red-shift factor depending on a relative dis-
tance between the two 3-branes. this red-shift factor operates universally on all mass scales
in our universe so it is dicult to generate two mass scales, such as the electroweak scale and
the gut scale, on our universe without recourse to additional mechanisms. one interesting
resolution to this puzzle is to consider at least three universe model where one d3-brane is
regarded as our universe and the remaining two d3-branes are taken to be hidden universes.
as there are two red-shift factors in this model, one could explain the planck/electroweak
hierarchy as well as the existence of the gut scale on our universe at the same time [10].

the organization of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we review our previous study [8].
here new solutions for the einstein equation are presented. moreover, it is stated in detail
about the reason why it is dicult to construct a model with only positive tension branes. in
section 3, based on the solutions reveiwed in section 2, we construct a model with two positive

2

tension 3-branes in a concrete way. the generalization to arbitrary number of positive tension
branes is also discussed. in section 4, we investigate mass hierarchy and trapping of gravity
along a similar line of arguments to the previous works [4, 7]. the nal section is devoted to
discussions and future directions of this work.

2 review of many domain wall model

we begin by briey reviewing a model of ref.[8]. this will enable us to establish our notations
and conventions and explain why it is dicult to construct a model consisting of only d3-
branes with positive tension.

our starting action is the einstein-hilbert action with the cosmological constant in ve

dimensions plus an action describing many domain walls in four dimensions [8]:

s =

1

22 z d4xz 2l

0

dzg (r  2) +

n

xi=1zz=li

d4xgili,

(1)

where the cosmological constant  is taken to a negative number, which implies that the
geometry of ve-dimensional bulk is anti-de sitter space-time. the fth dimension z is as-
sumed to be compact with the length 2l, but later regarded to be eectively non-compact
by taking the limit l  . moreover,  denotes the ve-dimensional gravitational constant
with a relation 2 = 8gn = 8
where gn and m are the ve-dimensional newton con-
m 3
stant and the ve-dimensional planck scale, respectively. throughout this article we follow
the standard conventions and notations of the textbook of misner, thorne and wheeler [11].
note one important distinction between our model (1) and the randall and sundrum model
[3, 4]. in the randall and sundrum model [3, 4] the geometry of the fth dimension is taken
to a singular orbifold geometry s1/z2 [5, 6], whereas in our model the topology of the fth
dimension is a circle s1 because the existence of many domain wall solution for the einstein
equation requires us to choose this smooth manifold.



variation of the action (1) with respect to the ve-dimensional metric tensor leads to the

einstein equation:

gm n r(cid:19) = ggm n  + 2

n

xi=1

gig

i m

 n

 li(z  li),

(2)

where m, n, ... denote ve-dimensional indices, whereas , , ... do four-dimensional ones.
provided that we adopt a metric ansatz

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn

= u(z)2dxdx + dz2,

(3)

with  denoting the four-dimensional minkowski metric, the einstein equation (2) reduces
to two combined dierential equations for the unknown function u(z):

n

xi=1 li(z  li),

where the prime denotes a dierentiation with respect to z and we have dened k as

k = s

.

in the previous paper [8], we have seeked special solutions with the form of

u(z) = ekf (z),

(5)

(6)

(7)

and we have presented two distinct solutions with simple and manageable form although the
other complicated solutions could be also constructed. these solutions describe even domain
walls standing along s1 at some intervals in ve-dimensional anti-de sitter space-time. one
solution describes n1

for which li (i = 1, 2,   , n1

the other solution describes n  1 even domain walls locating at li (i = 1, 2,   , n  1) and
takes the form

with i = 1, 2,   , n1

to close this section, it is worthwhile to argue why it is dicult to construct a model
consisting of only d3-branes with positive tension. this problem is indeed closely related to
various important problems associated with the models under consideration. before doing
that, let us recall that in the original randall-sundrum model [3, 4], there are two 3-branes
with opposite sign of brane tension at the boundaries of an orbifold s1/z2. also in our model,
there are the same number of 3-branes with positive tension and negative tension on a circle
s1. it was stressed in ref.[7] that the necessity for the negative energy objects might be one of
disadvantages in those setups since not only it is believed that the standard model is placed
on the d3-brane, which is certainly a positive energy object, but also some problematic facts
were pointed out in the cosmological context. for instance, the friedmann-like expanding
universe does not arise if the standard model is placed on the 3-brane with negative brane
tension [12, 13]. actually, in ref.[3], the standard model was located on such a negative
energy 3-brane in order to explain the exponential mass hierachy.

keeping these facts in mind, let us now turn to our question: why is it dicult to
construct a model consisting of only many d3-branes with positive tension? the answer can
be easily found from considerations of the electro-maganetics in a compact space. it is well
known that we cannot put a single point charge in a compact space since electric ux lines
have no place to go in the compact space. in other words, the eld equation does not admit
the existence of such a conguration. to remedy it, the simplest way is to introduce another
point charge with the same size but opposite sign to the rst point charge in order to make
the ux lines exactly close. the other simplest way is to take account of a non-compact space
by taking the limit of innitely large size.
in a non-compact space, the ux lines arising
from a single point charge could run to innity so we could have a consistent model with any
number and conguration of 3-branes. in fact, this latter procedure has been recently taken
by lykken and randall [7] at least implicitly in order to make a model with only positive
tension 3-branes.

incidentally, it is of interest to observe that a similar situation also occurs in the context
of d-brane theory [14]. the d-brane, unlike the fundamental string, carries positive r-r
charge. we cannot therefore put a single (or many) d-brane(s) in a compact region owing to
a non-zero total r-r charge. to cancel the r-r charge exactly, we are led to introduce some
objects which carry negative r-r charge with the same size. they are nothing but orientifolds!
from this analogy, it is interesting to regard 3-branes with positive and negative tension as
d3-branes and o3-planes, respectively. we think that we should pursue this analogy further
to understand a long-standing problem, i.e., the cosmological constant problem, in future.

3 a model with positive tension d3-branes

in this section, on the basis of the solutions given in the previous section, we will present a
concrete model which realizes simultaneously mass hierarchy and trapping of gravity on our
universe (visible 3-brane). an essential aspect with respect to the two phenomena is very
similar in the two distinct solutions eqs.(8), (10), so we limit ourselves to the type of the
solution eq.(10) in this paper. moreover, in this section and the next section, to start with,
we shall give a model in the case of two positive tension 3-branes and then extend it to a
more general case of arbitrary number of positive tension 3-branes.

let us start with a model with two positive tension branes and two negative tension

branes, which is a specic example (n = 5) of the solution (10):

f (z) = |z  l2| + |z  l3|  |z  l4| + l,
f (z) = (z)  (z  l2) + (z  l3)  (z  l4)  1,
f (z) = 2 [(z)  (z  l2) + (z  l3)  (z  l4)] .

of course, li must satisfy the relation (11) specied to n = 5 case:

l1 = l2 = l3 = l4 = 

6k
2 .

here, instead of eq.(12) we require slightly modied relations for li:

l = l2  l3 + l4, l1  0, ln  2l, l3 > 2l2.

(13)

(14)

(15)

the reason is that as mentioned in the paper [8], the solution (10) with the relation (12)
has a characteristic feature f (l2i1) = 0 (or equivalently, u(l2i1) = 1) which is a undesired
feature in explaining mass hierarchy. thus, in order to avoid this feature, we have imposed the
relation (15), specially, l3 > 2l2 on the solution (13). indeed, as shown in the next section,
this type solution has a desired feature with respect to both mass hierarchy and trapping
of gravity. and note that the positive tension domain walls are located at z = l1  0, l3
while the negative tension domain walls are at z = l2, l4 as seen in eq.(14). for comparison
with ref.[7], according to their terminology, we may call the positive tension 3-branes at
z = l1  0 and at z = l3 tev brane and planck brane, respectively 2. it might appear
to be dicult to move only the two negative tension branes to innity without changing the
essential contents of the model since the negaive and the positive tension branes are adjacent
in the solution (13). but the analysis in the next section reveals that this procedure can be
carried out by taking the limit of l2, 2l l4   with keeping l3  2l2 nite. in this way,
we can construct a model consisting of only two positive tension domain walls separated at
some distance along a non-compact fth dimension.

2our setup is dierent from that of ref.[7] where planck brane and tev brane are put at z = l1  0
and at z = l3, respectively. one can modify the present setup to coincide with their setup without any

diculty.

6

next let us present a model including general n1

2 positive tension domain walls which is
a straightforward generalization of the model with two positive tension domain walls. this
model is just given in terms of eq.(10) satisfying eq.(11) but modied relations among li
compared to eq.(12), and a limiting procedure. for convenience, let us write down explicitly
this general model with n1

2 positive tension d3-branes:

with i = 1, 2,   , n1

2 . and the limiting procedure is given by

f (l2i)  ,
with keeping f (l2i1) some nite, negative values.

(16)

(17)

4 exponential mass hierarchy and newtons law

in the previous section, we have presented a concrete model so we are now ready to consider
how this model resolves problems of mass hierarchy and trapping of gravity. as in the previous
section, let us start with the model with two positive tension domain walls. following the
formula given in ref.[8], it is straightforward to evaluate mass scale m(0) on the tev brane
located at z = l1  0 from mass scale m(l3) on the planck brane located at z = l3 to
which the planck mass scale is allocated. the result is of the form

m(0) = ek(l32l2)m(l3).

(18)

as stated in the previous section, since we have taken l3  2l2 to be a positive and nite
value, we can resolve the mass hierarchy if l3  2l2 is of order of 10. in other words, the
mass scale in our universe (tev brane) is of order electroweak scale thanks to the red-shift
factor in the geometry when the planck mass scale is assigned to another positive tension
domain wall (planck brane) at z = l3 and l3  2l2 is of order of 10.
next, let us turn our attention to a problem of trapping of gravity on tev brane. to so
that, we will consider the linearlized approximation of the metric tensor and examine small

7

uctuations h around the four-dimensional minkowski metric on the brane and determine
the graviton spectrum as well as the kaluza-klein spectrum. accordingly, we assume the
form

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn

= e2kf (z) ( + h(x, z)) dxdx + dz2.

(19)

then, with the gauge conditions h
equation is of the form

 = h = 0, up to the leading order of h, the eld

e2kf (z)h

 + 2k2h  kf (z)h = 0,
h

(20)

where  denotes the at space-time four-dimensional laplacian operator, and f (z) is dened
as in eq.(13). at this stage, if we consider the plane wave uctuations

h(x, z) = eipx

h(z), p2

 = m2,

eq.(20) reduces to the dierential equation for h(z)

z + 2k2  kf (z)# h(z) = 0,

(21)

(22)

it is more convenient to rewrite eq.(22) into the one-dimensional schrodinger wave-

equation by making a change of variables, y = 1

y + v (y)(cid:21) (y) =

where we have dened as

the one-dimensional potential is now given by

v (y) =

y2 

2
y

[(y  y1)  (y  y2) + (y  y3)  (y  y4)] ,

where yi(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are of the form

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

thus we have a relation

0 < y3 < y1 < y2 < y4,

(27)

where without loss of generality we have assumed y2 < y4. here an interesting thing has
happened owing to eq.(15). namely, the change of variables from z to y has caused a
rearrangement of the positions of domain walls where the two positive tension 3-branes are
located at the left side of the two negative tension 3-branes, so we can move the two negative
tension 3-branes to innity by taking the limit of l2, 2l  l4   with keeping l3  2l2
nite. note that the two positive tension 3-branes stay at the same points in this limit.
the one-dimensional schrodinger wave-equation eq.(23) gives rise to much useful infor-
mations about the graviton and a tower of the kaluza-klein modes. luckily enough, the
potential v (y) has a similar form to that in refs.[4, 7] so that we can take over the results
obtained there to the present case with an appropriate modication. first of all, the poten-
tial v (y) has the -functions at y = y1, y3 with negative coecients, which means that these
-functions supports a normalizable bound state mode, which is of course nothing but the
massless graviton. incidentally, the regulator branes with negative brane tension locating
at y = y2, y4, though they are moved to innity, induce the -functions with positive coe-
cients into the potential v (y), so these branes cannot support such a massless graviton. this
is the reason that in ref.[4], randall and sundrum have regarded the 3-brane with positive
tension as our universe for the trapping of graviton on the brane.

second, let us focus our attention to the properties of the continuous kk modes. in this
point, in the leading approximation, we can safely neglect the existence of the -functions in
the potential v (y). then, it turns out that the squared mass m2 of the kk modes is positive
denite as desired. in the non-compact limit, the potential falls o to zero, so there is no mass
gap between the massless graviton and the kk modes. at rst sight, this could be a signal
of danger since a tower of kk modes would give measurable eects to the modication of the
newtons law, but as shown shortly, they give rise to only small corrections to the newtons
law [4, 7]. we can easily write down the general solution for the continuous kk modes as

m(y) 

5

2

m

k2 y"y2(my) +

4k2

m2 j2(my)# ,

(28)

where y2 and j2 denote the bessel functions of order 2. from the above wave function, it
is straightforward to evaluate the corrections to the newtons law from the continuous kk
modes [4, 7]. in fact, the gravitational potential between two masses m1 and m2 takes the
form in the polar coordinate

u(r) = gn

0

dm
k

gn

m1m2emr

r

= gn

m1m2

r

(cid:18)1 +

1

k2r2(cid:19) .

(29)

accordingly, it turns out that an observer living in the tev brane (and also planck brane)
sees gravity as essentially four-dimensional since the corrections to the newtons law from the
kk modes are very small. (note that k is taken to be of order the planck scale.)

9

in the above, the case of the two d3-branes with positive tension has been investigated
in detail. the analysis of the general model eqs.(16) and (17) is quite straightforward and
very similar to the case of the two d3-branes, so that we will not repeat it in this paper.
for instance, in the schrodinger wave-equation (23), only the modication lies in the form of
the potential v (y) where n  1 -functions appear instead of 4 -functions. hence, we can
show the trapping of gravity on the d3-branes again. on the other hand, for the hierarchy
problem, one can also show that the electroweak scale is generated on our universe when the
planck scale is assigned to a hidden universe and an appropriate value of distance between
the two universes is chosen. however, in this general model, this is not the whole story since
there are many red-shift factors arising from relative distances between our universe and the
remaining hidden universes. this issue is worthy of further study and will be reported in
detail in a separate publication [10].

5 discussions

in this paper, we have investigated problems of both mass hierarchy and trapping of gravity on
our universe by using the solutions describing many domain walls which were previously found
by the present author [8]. our model in general consists of any number of positive tension
d3-branes in a non-compact extra dimension, and shows the exponential mass hierarchy and
trapping of gravity in our universe. in this sense, the study at hand shows that the scenario
by lykken and randall [7] is indeed realized.

since various matters and gauge elds are also localized on our d3-brane universe in
terms of the mechanism in string theory, our model is equipped with necessary conditions
as a realistic model. thus, future directions of this work would be to apply our model to
other unsolved problems. in fact, we can easily point out that our model has the following
advantages over the original randall-sundrum model. in the context of cosmology, since there
exist only positive tension d3-branes in our model, the lack of the friedmann-like expanding
universe is certainly resolved [12, 13]. and, in the context of phenomenology, some of puzzles
stated in a recent study [9] seem to be also resolved in terms of our general model including
many d3-branes since we have not a single but many red-shift factors associated with many
domain walls. these problems will be reported in a separate publication [10].
