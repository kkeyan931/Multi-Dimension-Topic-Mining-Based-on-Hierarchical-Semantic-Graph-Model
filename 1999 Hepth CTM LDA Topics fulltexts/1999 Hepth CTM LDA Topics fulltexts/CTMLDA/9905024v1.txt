abstract

we construct d-brane states on an asymmetric orbifold of type iia
on a four-torus, which is modded out by t-duality. we nd explicit
boundary states charged under the twisted sector gauge elds. unlike
other cases, the boundary states involve an explicit dependence on the
twist elds. the d-brane spectrum is consistent with the model being
equivalent to type iia on a four-torus.

1 introduction

asymmetric orbifolds are string vacua where the orbifold action acts dif-
ferently on the left- and right-movers [1]. since the left- and right-moving
bosons on the worldsheet see dierent target spaces, these vacua usually do
not have a simple geometrical interpretation. such vacua are potentially in-
teresting for phenomenology because they typically have very few moduli. in
certain cases, all moduli except the dilaton are projected out [2].

since these spaces have no geometrical interpretation, it is dicult to
ascertain where they lie in the web of string dualities.
in particular, it is
unknown whether all such orbifolds are smoothly connected to large volume
calabi-yau spaces. as a consequence, an m-theoretic interpretation of these
vacua is missing.

based on the experience with other string dualities, it is natural to guess
that the clue to understanding the non-perturbative structure of these orb-
ifolds is the understanding of their d-brane spectra. d-branes have been
shown to probe sub-stringy structure, and in other cases (e.g.
symmet-
ric orbifolds), the metric on the d-brane worldvolume reproduces expected
properties of the underlying geometry [3]. it is of great interest, therefore,
to analyze the moduli space metric in cases where no underlying geometric
structure is known, as in the case of asymmetric orbifolds.

furthermore, d-branes control the strong coupling behaviour of a theory
in many cases, so the knowledge of the d-brane spectra constrains possible
dual models, and may also suggest guesses for the dual theory.

asymmetric orbifolds have also arisen in a recent attempt to construct
non-supersymmetric vacua with zero cosmological constant [4]. it was shown
that in a particular model the cosmological constant vanished to two loops
and it was conjectured to vanish to all orders in perturbation theory. non-
perturbative contributions then become important, and in [5] an example
was analyzed where duality arguments suggested the existence of a non-
perturbative contribution to the cosmological constant. it is of interest to
see if direct computations using d-branes in this model support this result.
so again we are led to the study of d-brane spectra.

from a technical point of view, constructing d-branes in asymmetric
spaces is qualitatively dierent from the symmetric case. d-branes are de-
ned as endpoints of strings, so at the boundary of the string worldsheet one
has to provide a boundary condition relating the left moving elds to the
right-moving elds. however, in asymmetric spaces, there is no obvious way

1

to write such a condition. heuristically, this is why not all string theories
have d-branes.

the question studied in this paper is that of the existence (and construc-
tion) of twisted d-branes, i.e. d-branes that couple to r-r elds coming
from a twisted sector. an untwisted brane can be constructed by summing
all images of a boundary state under the orbifold action [6]. however, these
states are, at least in the example studied here, not the minimal d-brane
states. for example they preserve only a quarter of the supersymmetries.

we shall construct d-branes in a special example, where we can avoid
many of the more dicult problems. this is the case of type ii string theory
on an orbifold of the four-torus, where the orbifold action is that of an overall
t-duality [7]. this turns out to have a second description in terms of type ii
string theory on t 4, where the d-brane spectrum is known. in this case, using
the equivalent description, we are able to construct the d-branes explicitly.
we nd that the d-branes indeed arise from twisted sectors of the asym-
metric orbifold. we describe these states explicitly as boundary states [8, 9].
using this formalism, we show that these d-branes behave exactly as ex-
pected of branes on a four-torus. in particular they are bps states, preserving
half of the supersymmetry. furthermore, the d-branes from the untwisted
sector are shown to be combinations of twisted d-branes. it is the twisted
branes that play the role of the elementary objects in the equivalent torus
description.

this result leaves important questions unanswered; it is not known how
to construct the twisted d-branes on general asymmetric spaces. it, how-
ever, provides an existence proof of twisted d-branes, and emphasizes their
importance. hopefully, the example here may also hint at a more general
construction. we hope to return to these questions in the future.

the paper is organized as follows. we review in section 2 the general
formalism of boundary states as applied to toroidal backgrounds of type ii
string theory. in section 3 we introduce the t-duality orbifold, compute the
closed string spectrum and demonstrate the spacetime symmetries of the
models. these symmetries are used in section 4 to construct the boundary
state for a general bps saturated d-brane in this model.

while this work was in progress, we became aware of [6], where related

issues are discussed.

2 boundary states on a torus

let us briey review the construction of boundary states [8, 9] in toroidal
backgrounds. we denote by x6, . . . , x9 four compactied directions, with radii
r6, . . . , r9. to avoid introducing (super)ghosts, we will work in the light-
cone gauge as in [10]. we consider dirichlet boundary conditions localizing
the d-branes at the origin of all non-compact directions.

the problem at hand is to construct the boundary states |bi satisfying

the boundary conditions

(ln  ln)|bi = 0

(1)

this condition ensures that the resulting open string theory is conformally
invariant. further conditions (called cardys conditions [12]) are necessary
to make the open string sector a sensible boundary cft (e.g. degeneracies
should be integral).

in practice, the above condition is hard to solve. instead one imposes (in

the free eld case) the more restrictive condition [9]

(i
(

n  i
n + 

n)|bi = 0
n)|bi = 0,

(2)

where i = p+1, ..., 9 labels the dirichlet directions, and  labels the neumann
directions. this manifestly implies (1), since

ln = xm (cid:16)i
mi
ln = xm (cid:16)i
m i

nm(cid:17)
mn(cid:17)

nm + 

m

mn + 

m 

(3)

note that the condition requires the u(1)4 invariance of the torus, or gen-
erally a chiral symmetry algebra larger than simply the virasoro algebra
[9].

the condition (2) is solved, in the bosonic case, by the coherent state

|dp; ki = exp{xn>0

1
n

(i

n i

n  

n 

n)}|ki,

(4)

where |ki denotes the string ground state of momentum ki in the i directions
and winding m in the  directions. this state is called an ishibashi state.

3

to maintain worldsheet supersymmetry, we need to impose conditions on

the fermions as well. in the ns-ns sector, the conditions are

(i
(

r  i i
r + i 

r)|dp; ; kin sn s = 0
r)|dp; ; kin sn s = 0

where  is a sign needed for gso projection.

the corresponding ishibashi state is

1

(i

|dp; ; kin sn s = exp{xn>0

n

where |fin sn s is the nsns fermionic fock vacuum.

to gso project, we note that (1)f and (1) f act as

r}|fin sn s

(1)f|dp; ; kin sn s = |dp;; kin sn s
f|dp; ; kin sn s = |dp;; kin sn s

and hence the gso projected state is

|dp; kin sn s =

1
2

(|dp; +; kin sn s  |dp;; kin sn s )

(5)

we now perform the same analysis in the rr sector. the boundary

conditions are then

(i

r  i i

r)|dp; ; kirr = 0

with the solution

|dp; ; kirr = exp{xn>0

(10)

where |firr is an appropriately chosen r-r vacuum. the fock vacuum of
the r-r sector carries left- and right spinor indices, and as a result of the
condition (9) for the fermionic zero modes, is constrained to satisfy [14, 16]:

(i
(

0  i i
0 + i 

0)|firr = 0
0 )|firr = 0

4

(11)

the action of (1)f and (1) f is now

(1)f|dp; ; kirr = (1)7p|dp;; kirr
(1)

f|dp; ; kirr = |dp;; kirr

therefore the gso projected state in the r-r sector is

|dp; kirr =

1
2

(|dp; +; kirr + |dp;; kirr)

(12)

(13)

to make the state spacetime supersymmetric, we need to combine the

ns-ns and r-r sectors appropriately. the result turns out to be [16, 15]

|dp; ki =

1
2

(|dp; kin sn s  4i|dp; kirr)

(14)

where the +, signs refer to branes and anti-branes respectively.
we still need to satisfy cardys conditions. this is achieved by taking a
linear combination of the above states. in eect, this is a fourier transform
from momentum basis to position basis. the result is [15]

|dp; xi = z

|dp; njiid

9

y=7+pqr xmz

ei2rm x|dp; miin

(15)

where nj, m are the quantized momenta and winding in the compact direc-
tions.

the result is a d-brane state localized in the origin of the noncompact

dimensions. the generalization to more general states is straightforward.

3 the t-duality orbifold

we now discuss the example of type iia theory compactied on an asym-
metric orbifold of t 4. the orbifold group is chosen to be z2, generated by a
reection of all left moving oscillators:

n

n  i
i
n  i
i
i
r  i
i
r  i
|firr  1234|firr

r

n

r

5

(16)

where i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

this action is an overall t-duality, therefore we refer to this model as
the t-duality orbifold. this action is only a symmetry of the torus at the
self-dual radius. we are interested in computing the massless spectrum of
this model, using lightcone quantization of the rns string.

in order for the model to be consistent (modular invariant), one has to
check level matching. for an orbifold element of order n, one has to satisfy
[11]:

el  er = 0 mod

1
n

(17)

where el, er are the ground state energies of the left- and right- movers
respectively. this guarantees that the physical states, which have to be
invariant under the orbifold action, are level matched [13].

here the only non-trivial check is for the z2 generator. the ground state
energies for the left movers include contributions from the twisted bosons
and fermions, as well as from the non-compact directions, and are found to
be:

el
r = 0
el
n s = 0

the right movers have the standard ground state energies:

er

r = 0
er
n s = 

1
2

(18)

(19)

therefore level matching is satised in all 4 sectors of the rns string.

the massless spectrum of the orbifold is identical to that of type ii on
a 4-torus, making it natural to conjecture that these two models are in fact
equivalent, including their d-brane spectrum. to study the mapping be-
tween these two vacua we concentrate on the correspondence between space-
time supersymmetry generators, as well as vector elds corresponding to the
isometries of the 4-torus.

in the untwisted sector of the orbifold, one nds that 2 out of the 8
gravitini are projected out, leaving 6 gravitini (24 real components) in 6
dimensions. specically, in the r-ns sector, half of the components of the
left-moving spin operator are not invariant under the orbifold action, and are

6

projected out. we denote the surviving left moving spin operator by s. it
is dened by:

1234s = s

(20)

here  = 1, 2 is an su(2) index, which is denoted by su(2)i.

on the other hand, two supersymmetry generators return in the twisted
sector. the r-ns sector of the twisted sector contains one gravitino, made
entirely from non-compact bosons and fermions. this is because the internal
fermions in the twisted ramond sector have no zero modes. the degeneracy
of the twisted sector ground state is computed as in [1], and is found to be
2. altogether the model has the maximal supersymmetry in six dimensions.
the study of the spacetime vectors is related to the isometries of the

4-torus, and is important in constructing d-brane states.

on the orbifold model, 4 vectors arise in the untwisted sector

vl = 

1/2

r

1/2|fin sn s

(21)

where the directions of the 4-torus in the orbifold model are denoted by the
index r = 1, ..., 4.

the additional 4 vectors arise in the twisted sector as follows. the twisted
sector vacuum for the left movers is generated by bosonic twist operators
acting on the usual ns vacuum. there are two such twist operators, , as
the ground state degeneracy of the twisted sector is 2. here  is also an
su(2) index; we denote this su(2) by su(2)t .

the bosonic twist operators  have dimension 1

4 . in addition there is
a fermionic twist operator, which in the z2 case reduces to the usual spin
operator. there are 2 spin operators, s, that are invariant under the orbifold
action. they have dimension 1
4 as well, so the total twist operator carries
dimension 1
in summary we nd that the left moving ground state has
2.
degeneracy 4, which we denote by an so(4) = su(2)i  su(2)t vector
index r.
these twisted ground states are generated from the ns vacuum by 4
2, which are denoted for later convenience as j r. it is
operators of dimension 1
easy to show that j r are gso odd. using the mapping of su(2)i  su(2)t
into so(4) we can write:
(22)

j r = (r)s 
the additional 4 massless vectors are then:

vr = 

1/2j r|fin sn s

7

(23)

note that they are gso even as required.

we wish to compare these states with their counterparts in the torus
description. type ii string theory on the 4-torus has 8 massless vectors in
the ns-ns sector, related to momentum and winding modes on the 4-torus.
the corresponding states are:

vl = 
vr = 

1/2

a
1/2|fin sn s
1/2a
1/2|fin sn s

(24)

where a, a are fermions in the 4-torus directions (a = 1, ..., 4), and , 
are fermions in the noncompact directions.

it is then natural to identify the new torus elds as:

r  a
j r  a

(25)

similarly in the left and right-moving ramond sectors, the ground states
carry spinor indices of so(4). the spinor indices of the non-compact direc-
tions are suppressed. denote, as above, the spinor index which is invariant
under reection by , and the other spinor index by . the ground state
degeneracy in the twisted sector is parametrized by the index .

with these notations, the right moving spinors of the new torus can be

identied as s and s . the left-moving spinors are s and .

having identied the torus symmetries in the asymmetric orbifold lan-
guage, we are ready to use those symmetries to write the d-brane boundary
states.

4 boundary states

in the t-duality orbifold, it is possible to construct untwisted branes by
starting with any brane on the torus, and adding its images under the z2
action. for example a 0-brane with any location on the torus is t-dual to
a 4-brane wrapped on the torus, with some wilson lines on its worldvol-
ume. the z2 invariant boundary state is simply the sum of these two states.
it is charged only with respect to untwisted sector elds, hence the name
untwisted.

the interpretation of this state in the new torus description is not trivial.
the locations and wilson lines are separate moduli of the two components

8

in the boundary state. as the state is required to be z2 invariant, its moduli
space is t 4.
it is therefore natural to interpret this untwisted state as a
single d-brane state on the new torus. however, this is incorrect since the
untwisted brane preserves only a quarter of the supersymmetry generators.
in the equivalent torus description such states are made from two types of
d-branes, and have a larger moduli space.

therefore, similar to the closed string spectrum, the untwisted branes give
only a subset of the expected d-brane states on the new torus. in particular,
the naive moduli space of an untwisted brane is incorrect unless one allows
more general twisted branes.

in order to construct the general d-brane state we are therefore forced to
consider twisted branes, that is, branes that carry some twisted r-r charge.
for a general asymmetric orbifold this is a dicult task. constructing bound-
ary states is usually done by imposing not just conformal invariance, but a
more restrictive invariance under some chiral algebra. by construction, the
chiral algebras for the left or right movers are dierent in most twist sectors.
it is then impossible to use the usual ansatz to construct boundary states in
each twist sector separately.

however, in the case considered in this paper, one can use the symme-
tries identied in the last section to construct boundary states. we start by
constructing the ns-ns component of the boundary states.

the right movers of the new torus were identied as the elds r of
2) and their partners x r of dimension (0, 1). the left movers
dimension (0, 1
are the twist elds j r of dimension ( 1
2, 0), and their partners denoted as t r,
of dimension (1, 0). we denote the modes of any operator o by on, except
the modes of x and x, which are denoted by n and n respectively.

it is now straightforward to write the ishibashi states for an arbitrary
d-brane state. for example any d-brane with dirichlet boundary condition
in the torus directions (i.e. an unwrapped brane) has the factor:

|bin sn s = exp xn

j r
n

r

n!|fin sn s

(26)

this is multiplied by the part of the boundary state coming from the
non-compact directions, which is given in section 2. one has to sum over the
states|bin sn s in order to project into gso invariant states, as one does in
at space.
as explained in section 2, in order to preserve supersymmetry, one has

t r
n r

n + ixn

9

to consider also r-r boundary states. to nd the correct combination of
sectors to generate a bps state we are guided by the explicit form of the
spacetime supersymmetry operators. intuitively, for the complete boundary
state to be bps saturated, the r-r boundary states are to be related to
the ns-ns boundary state by spacetime supersymmetry operators (spectral
ow).

in the present case the situation is similar. the supersymmetry gener-
ators from the left-moving sector are generated by the operators s and 
(the spin operators from the non-compact directions are suppressed). those
two operators create square root cuts in j r, dened in (22). therefore we
have to consider the sectors dened by the insertion of the supersymmetry
generators at the origin. those sectors dene unusual, mixed, periodicity
conditions for the original bosons and fermions, but act simply on the new
variables j r, t r. we refer to these sectors loosely as the ramond sectors for
the left movers.

in each such sector the fermionic currents j r are now integer moded. the
construction of the r-r boundary states is identical to the one in section 2.
one obtains :

|birr

=

exp xn>0

1
n

(t i

n i

n) + ixr>0

j i
r

i

r!|firr

(27)

we have suppressed the dependence on the noncompact directions. the
vacua |firr are the vacua of the r-r sectors, where the left-mover sector is
a ramond sector in the sense dened above. those vacua have to be chosen
now to satisfy:

0  i i
(j i
0 + i 
(j 

0)|firr = 0
0 )|firr = 0

the complete boundary state can be written as:

|bi =

1
2

(|bin sn s  4i|birr)

(28)

(29)

furthermore, in order to obtain neumann boundary conditions in any of
torus directions one can modify the boundary state as described in section
2. the gso projection acts, as in type iia, asymmetrically. hence, only

10

even dimensional branes survive. we thus obtain the complete spectrum of
d-branes in type iia on t 4.

as a nal note we comment on the untwisted d-brane. since some of
the left-moving supersymmetry generators come from the twisted sector, it
is clear that one cannot obtain a bps state that breaks only half of the
supersymmetry when one uses only the untwisted elds. given the general
d-brane state above, equation (29), one can recover any untwisted brane by
an appropriate linear combination of those states. one then veries the claim
that the untwisted branes are two-object states which leave only a quarter
of the supersymmetries unbroken.
