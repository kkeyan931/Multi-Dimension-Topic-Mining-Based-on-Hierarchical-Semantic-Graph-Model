(3.23) (3.24) (3.25) (3.26) restrictions (unlike case ms) immediately follow therefore need use delicate procedure prove condition (3.25). let us split integral eq.(3.18) three parts, g(, 0) = 0. g() = i1() + i2() + i3(), 1 2 i1 = z0 g d, i2 = z1 g d, i3 = z2 g d, 1, 2 arbitrary numbers 0 < 1 1 2 < function g(, ) dened eq.(3.18). applying known asymptotic behaviour macdonald function  obtain u = ln(m) < 0, |u| 1 8 g(, ) = g() 1, sin(u ln 2), cos(u ln 2 arg (i)), 1, sin( ln u + (ln 2 1) + /4), 1.
