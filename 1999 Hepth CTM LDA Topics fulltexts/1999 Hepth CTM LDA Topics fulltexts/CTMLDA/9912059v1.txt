abstract

we introduce the spinor parallel propagator for maximally symmetric spaces in
any dimension. then, the dirac spinor greens functions in the maximally symmetric
spaces rn, sn and h n are calculated in terms of intrinsic geometric objects. the
results are covariant and coordinate-independent.

1 introduction

the study of eld theory in anti-de sitter (ads) spaces, which topologically are hyper-
bolic maximally symmetric spaces, has been revived over the past two years following
the so-called maldacena conjecture relating type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 with
n = 4, u (n ) super yang mills theory in four dimensions.
more than a decade ago, the calculation of correlation functions in maximally sym-
metric spaces using only intrinsic geometric objects was presented in a series of papers
starting with [2, 3, 4]. in one of them [4], greens functions for two-component spinors
in maximally symmetric four-spaces were considered using the sl(2, r) formulation.
to our knowledge, this analysis has not been extended since to dirac spinors in other
space-time dimensions. however, it should be mentioned that spinor greens functions
in ads spaces have been considered and calculated by other means in the context of
the ads/cft correspondence [5, 6].

in the present paper, we present an intrinsically geometric approach to spinor
greens functions in maximally symmetric spaces.
in section 2, we introduce the
spinor parallel propagator for maximally symmetric spaces of dimension n and nd
its covariant derivatives. then, in section 3, we calculate the spinor greens functions
for the spaces rn, sn and h n. finally, section 4 contains conclusions.

in the remainder of this section, we would like to review the elementary maximally
symmetric bi-tensors, which have been discussed in detail by allen and jacobsen [3].
consider a maximally symmetric space of dimension n with constant scalar curva-
ture n(n  1)/r2. for the space sn, the radius r is real and positive, whereas for the
hyperbolic space h n, r = il with l positive, and in the at case, rn, r = .
consider further two points x and x, which can be connected uniquely by a shortest
geodesic. let  be the proper geodesic distance along this shortest geodesic between
x and x. then, the vectors

n(x, x) = d(x, x) and n (x, x) = d (x, x)

(1)

are tangent to the geodesic and have unit length. furthermore, denote by g
= g 
the vector parallel propagator along the geodesic. notice the relation n 

 (x, x)
n.

  satisfy the following prop-

these elementary maximally bi-tensors n, n

and g

erties:

dn = a(g  nn)
dn = c(g + nn)
dg = (a + c)(g n + gn),

where a and c are functions of the geodesic distance  and are given by

a =

1
r

cot


r

and c = 

1

r sin(/r)

.

therefore, they satisfy the relations

da/d = c 2,

dc/d = ac and c 2  a2 = 1/r2.

finally, our convention for covariant gamma matrices is {, } = 2g .

2 spinor parallel propagator

to start, consider a bi-spinor (x, x)
spinors in a maximally symmetric space-time, i.e. it performs the parallel transport

 , which acts as parallel propagator for dirac

(x)

= (x, x)

 (x).

the spinor parallel propagator (x, x) can be uniquely dened for any space-time

dimension by the following properties:

(x, x) = [(x, x)]1,
 

(x) = (x, x)(x)(x, x)g 

 (x, x),

nd(x, x) = 0.
 = 

(5a)

(5b)

(5c)

eqn. (5a) implies that (x, x)
 , whereas eqn. (5b) conveniently formulates the
parallel transport of the covariant gamma matrices. finally, eqn. (5c) says that (x, x)
is covariantly constant along the geodesic of parallel transport.

we would like to evaluate now a particular property of (x, x), namely its covariant

derivative. therefore, combine eqns. (5a) and (5b) to
(x, x) = (x, x)

g


and dierentiate covariantly with respect to x to obtain

d(x, x) = d(x, x)

  (a + c)(x, x)
g

(

n + gn),

(6)

(7)

where we have used the property (2c) of the vector parallel propagator. now, use eqn.
(6) for the second term on the right hand side of eqn. (7) and multiply with , which
yields
2d(x, x)  d/ (x, x) = d/ (x, x)
thus, a multiplication with  leads to

g
 + (a + c)( n  nn)(x, x). (8)

the solution of which is

(2  n)d/ (x, x) = d/ (x, x)

g
,

d/ (x, x) = bn(x, x),

(9)

where b is some function of the geodesic distance . then, substituting eqn. (9) into
eqn. (8) yields

2d(x, x) = 2bn(x, x) + (a + c)(n  nn)(x, x).

moreover, multiplying this with n and using eqn. (5c) one determines b to be

b =

1
2

(n  1)(a + c).

therefore, one nally obtains

d(x, x) =

1
2

(a + c) (n  n) (x, x).

(10)

for completeness, we also give the expression for d(x, x). it is easily obtained

from eqn. (10) using eqn. (5a) and is given by

d(x, x) = 

1

(a + c)(x, x)(cid:16) 

n   n(cid:17) .

3 spinor greens function

using the spinor parallel propagator (x, x) calculated in section 2, we would now like
to nd the spinor greens function s(x, x) satisfying

(cid:2)(d/  m)s(x, x)(cid:3)

  =

(x  x)
pg(x)


 .

(12)

here, we have written the indices explicitly in order to emphasize that this is a bi-spinor
equation. we shall henceforth omit the indices.

now, we make the general ansatz

s(x, x) = [() + ()n] (x, x),

(13)

where  and  are functions of the geodesic distance  still to be determined. we
substitute the ansatz (13) into eqn. (12) and, after using eqn. (10), obtain the two
coupled dierential equations

in order to proceed, multiply eqn. (14) with m and substitute m from eqn. (15).

3.1 greens function for rn
for rn, we have a = c = 1/, r =  and  = |x  x|. thus, eqn. (16) becomes

i.e. n = /m, so that the nal result for the spinor greens function in rn is

3.2 greens function for s n
in order to solve eqn. (16), we consider rst x 6= x and make the substitution

z = cos2 
2r

.

this yields the dierential equation

4z (cid:21) (z) = 0.

then, writing (z) = z(z), one obtains a hypergeometric equation for ,

the solution of eqn. (23) which is singular at z = 1 is [7]

(z) =  f(a, b; c; z) =  f(n/2  i|m|r, n/2 + i|m|r; n/2 + 1; z),

where  is a proportionality constant. therefore, (z) is

(z) = z f(n/2  i|m|r, n/2 + i|m|r; n/2 + 1; z).

(25)

we can now determine the constants  by matching the singularity in eqn. (16). this
is equivalent to demanding the singularity of  at  = 0 to have the same strength as
in the case of rn. one nds from eqn. (25)

  

whereas in rn we have, from eqn. (18),

(n/2 + 1)(n/2  1)

(n/2  i|m|r)(n/2 + i|m|r)(cid:16)

comparing these two expressions we nd

finally, one can calculate  from eqn. (15), which yields

it should be noticed that  has a nite m  0 limit, whereas  vanishes.

3.3 greens function for h n

for h n, we can start with eqn. (23) and set r = il, i.e. we have to solve

h(a, b; c; z)(z) = 0

with

a =

n

+ |m|l,

b =

n

c =

(29a)

(29b)

there are two solutions to eqn. (29) which behave asymptotically like a power of z for
z  . these are

(z) = z( n

2 |m|l) f(cid:18) n

2  |m|l,|m|l; 1  2|m|l;

1

z(cid:19) ,

(30)

where  are constants. the choice of the minus sign is not always possible. in fact,
for 1  2|m|l = 0,1,2, . . . the hypergeometric series is indeterminate. thus, we
shall include the solution with the minus sign only, if |m|l < 1/2. hence, we have two
solutions for ,

(z) = z( n1

2 |m|l) f(cid:18) n
and we can now proceed to determine the constants  in a similar fashion as in the
sn case. from eqn. (31) we nd for   0

2  |m|l,|m|l; 1  2|m|l;

z(cid:19) ,

(31)

1

2l(cid:17)2n (1  2|m|l)(n/2  1)
(n/2  |m|l)(|m|l)
comparing this expression to the rn case, eqn. (26), we nd

  (cid:16) 

.

 = sgn m 2(n2|m|l)l1n

(n/2  |m|l)

(n1)/2(1/2  |m|l)

,

(32)

where the doubling formula for gamma functions has been used.

finally, let us calculate  from eqn. (15). using a recursion formula for hypergeo-

metric functions we nd

(z) =

z(cid:19) .

(33)

it is interesting to note that in the limit m  0 the functions + and  become
identical, whereas + and  do not, but dier in their signs. the reason is, of course,
that, for m = 0, eqns. (14) and (15) decouple, and  can be a solution of eqn. (15)
with arbitrary proportionality constant. moreover, for m = 0, the common value of
 is a rational function of z,

(z) =

(n/2)
(2)n l1n(z  1)(n1)/2.

4 conclusions

we have introduced the spinor parallel propagator for maximally symmetric spaces
in any dimension. this enabled us to nd expressions for the dirac spinor greens
functions in the maximally symmetric spaces rn, sn and h n in terms of intrinsic
geometric objects. although there are obstructions to the quantization of spinors in
odd dimensional manifolds with boundary [8], our results should be applicable to the
ads/cft correspondence, because of the classical dynamics in ads space.
