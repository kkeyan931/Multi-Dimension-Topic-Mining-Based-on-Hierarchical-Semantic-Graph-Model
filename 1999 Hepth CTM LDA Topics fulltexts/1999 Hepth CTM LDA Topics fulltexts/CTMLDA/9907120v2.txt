abstract

the non-renormalization theorems of chiral vertex functions are derived on the
basis of an algebraic analysis. the property, that the interaction vertex is a
second supersymmetry variation of a lower dimensional eld monomial, is used
to relate chiral green functions to supercially convergent green functions
by extracting the two supersymmetry variations from an internal vertex and
transforming them to derivatives acting on external legs. the analysis is
valid in the massive as well as in the massless model and can be performed
irrespective of properties of the superpotential at vanishing momentum.

1. introduction

cancellations of ultraviolet divergencies in globally supersymmetric eld theories,
sometimes denoted as mysterious, have been observed at a very early stage in the de-
velopment of the eld [1] and have been ever since considered as a hallmark of these
theories. iliopoulos and zumino [2] were the rst to analyze such cancellations, which are
not (direct) consequences of the supersymmetric ward identities, in the framework of su-
persymmetric wesszumino models. since then several authors [3, 4, 5] have contributed
to the development and streamlining of supergraph formalism in superspace, by which
the cancellations in various models can be veried straightforwardly. a careful examina-
tion on the other hand of the renormalization of supersymmetric eld theories by means
of the algebraic renormalization procedure has been undertaken in [6]. but the cancel-
lations of ultraviolet singularities, alias the non-renormalization theorems, were rather
elusive in this approach. our purpose is to overcome this shortcoming by a derivation
of the non-renormalization theorems adaptable to the algebraic renormalization method.
as a rst step into this direction we reconsider here the d=4 wesszumino model. we
will show that the non-renormalization theorems in this model can be deduced from the
fact that the interaction lagrangian of mass dimension 4 may be represented as second
supersymmetry variation of a eld monomial with mass dimension 3:

this sort of cohomological argument was rst used by zumino [7] to demonstrate that
the vacuum graphs in supersymmetric eld theories vanish. it was later on exploited [8]
for the construction of the perturbative (inverse) nicolai map.

our argumentation will rely on two ingredients. first of all we extend the wess
zumino model, coupling the chiral and anti-chiral interaction vertices to external eld
multiplets. local couplings have been already considered in the context of conformal sym-
metry breaking in the ordinary 4 model [9]. in the wesszumino model local couplings
are necessarily superelds and in this way the cohomological structure of the interaction
vertices (1.1) is included in the action of the extended wesszumino model. the orig-
inal model is recovered in the limit of constant external eld. the non-renormalization
theorems will appear as simple consequence of the supersymmetry ward identities of the
extended model. we make secondly use of a modied r-symmetry of the extended model
involving a non-trivial r-transformation of the external eld multiplet. the modied
r-symmetry will turn out to be an ecient bookkeeping device for our purposes.

1

the massless wesszumino model requires a separate consideration.

it was noted
in refs. [10, 11] that in contradiction to standard lore the radiative corrections to the
superpotential of the massless wesszumino model do not vanish. deriving the non-
renormalization theorems from the cohomological structure of the interaction vertices, it
is possible to disentangle the ultraviolet and infrared aspects of this phenomenon. the
supersymmetric specic ultraviolet cancellation based on eq. (1.1) survives the massless
limit. the integrated 3-insertion of mass dimension 3 on the other hand develops an
infrared singularity at zero momentum which is canceled by the explicitly extracted powers
of external momenta leaving behind a non-vanishing contribution to the eective potential.

in section 2 we introduce local supereld couplings in the wesszumino model and
dene in this way the green functions with covariant vertex insertions. from the su-
persymmetry ward identities the non-renormalization theorem for chiral green functions
with one antichiral vertex insertion is derived. in section 3 we discuss consequences of the
modied r-symmetry and supersymmetry for 1pi green functions. in section 4 we relate
the chiral green functions with antichiral vertex insertions to the chiral green functions
of the wesszumino model. we prot from the modied r-symmetry, which simplies
the combinatorics and makes possible to generalize the result to arbitrary normalization
conditions of the wave-function renormalization. in section 5 we treat the massless model
and discuss the limit to vanishing momenta. in an appendix we give the results of the
algebraic analysis of non-renormalization theorems in expressions of component elds.
throughout the paper we will use the notations of ref. [6].

2. the wesszumino model with local couplings

the wesszumino model contains the chiral supereld a(x, , ) and its complex con-
jugate, the antichiral supereld a(x, , ). in the chiral and antichiral representation they
are expanded in the component elds according to

a(x, ) = (x) + (x) + 2f (x),

a(x, ) = (x) +  (x) + 2 f (x).

the wave-function renormalization is xed at an arbitrary normalization point 2, whereas
the mass and the coupling are normalized at pi = 0. when the model is constructed with
local couplings in section 3 and section 4, it is seen, that the normalization point pi = 0 for
chiral vertices is indeed distinguished from other normalization momenta. in this paper
we refer to the bphz scheme [12] in superspace [13] for removing the divergencies. it has
the advantage to preserve supersymmetry in the subtraction procedure. the subtraction
degree and the possible degree of divergence are given by simple power counting theorems
in superspace.
in particular the maximal degree of divergence for a supergraph with
ns = na + n a external legs is determined by

d  3  ns

if the supergraph has only chiral or antichiral legs,

(2.6)

d  2  ns

if chiral and antichiral legs are present.

by power counting all diagrams belonging to vertices of the classical action could be
logarithmically divergent. the non-renormalization theorems of chiral vertex functions,
i.e. the actual niteness of all chiral and antichiral vertex functions, are not an immediate
consequence of supersymmetry, but are proven by an explicit evaluation of diagrams in
superspace [3, 4, 5].

in the present paper we derive the non-renormalization theorems of chiral vertices
from the algebraic property, that the interaction vertices of the wesszumino model are

(2.8)

when one wants to consider the eect of this property on green functions, supersymmetric

covariant vertices a3(x, ) and a3(x, ) instead of the invariant vertices r ds a3(x, ) and
r d s a3(x, ) have to be included into the construction of the wesszumino model.

the construction of covariant insertions in quantum eld theory is a well understood
subject and is most easily performed by coupling the covariant eld polynomials to exter-
nal elds in such a way, that the complete action is invariant. accordingly we introduce
external chiral and antichiral superelds with dimension zero,

(x, ) = (x) + (x) + 2f (x),

(x, ) = (x) +  (x) + 2 f (x),

(2.9)

which transform under supersymmetry transformations as the elds a and a (2.3). since
the eld monomials a3 and a3 are transformed as the elds, supersymmetry is maintained,
when we couple  and  to the covariant insertions:

a3(x, )  z ds(x, )a3(x, ),

a3(x, )  z d s (x, ) a3(x, ).

instead of adding a further interaction term to the action of the wesszumino model we
interpret the elds (x, ) and (x, ) as local couplings in superspace:

the classical action of wesszumino model (2.2) is recovered by taking the limit

and

contributions to green functions with local couplings are dened in higher orders
as usual by the gell-mannlow formula, wicks theorem and a subtraction scheme for

removing the divergencies. the bphz scheme in superspace can be applied to the wess
zumino model with local coupling without modications. in this scheme the ward iden-
tities of supersymmetry are fullled to all orders by construction:

with zi  (xi, i) and zj  (xj, j). since the perturbative expansion is an expansion in
the local couplings, the total number of chiral and antichiral vertices is determined by
the number of a- and a-legs and increases by 2 from order to order: the number m of
antichiral s is therefore not an independent quantity in eq. (2.13):

m  m(n, n, m, l) = n + n + 2(l  1)  m.

the generating functional of 1pi green functions of the ordinary wesszumino model is
obtained in the limit to constant coupling:

(a, a, , ) = (a, a).

(2.15)

for dening the green functions of the extended wesszumino model unambiguously
the possible counterterms depending on local couplings have to be xed by suitable nor-
malization conditions and symmetries. we postpone this discussion to the next section
and deduce here immediately the most important results of the construction. for this
purpose the normalization conditions are implicitly dened by the bphz scheme at zero
momentum.

from the insertion by raising its dimensions by + 1
2. (see ref. [6] for a detailed denition
of normal products in superspace.) since the model with local couplings satises the
supersymmetry ward identities (2.11) one derives consequences for the green functions
with covariant vertex insertions by dierentiating the ward identity with respect to :2

(2.18)

(the ward operator of supersymmetry on the left-hand-side only involves the elds a and
a.) eq. (2.18) is the key relation for the foundation of the non-renormalization theorems,
since it generalizes the cohomological property, that invariant vertices are supersymmetry
variations, eq. (2.8), to insertions into nonlocal diagrams. dierentiating eq. (2.18) once
more with respect to , one is able to derive an identity, which relates the highest 4-
dimensional component of the supermultiplet a3 with its lowest 3-dimensional component
by applying twice the ward operator of supersymmetry transformations:

chiral insertions are derived by complex conjugation.

integrating over x and using translational invariance chiral vertex functions with an inte-
grated internal (supersymmetric) antichiral vertex are related to vertex functions with a

it is seen from this equation that chiral vertex functions with one antichiral vertex vanish
at zero momentum and by power counting the degree of divergence is improved by 2
from the left-hand-side to the right-hand-side: one gets one degree of improvement from
the dimension of the 3-insertion and one degree from two  variables counting each with
dimension 1
2. for the specic normalization conditions of the bphz scheme at zero
momentum eq. (2.21) already implies the non-renormalization theorems of chiral vertex
functions in the wesszumino model. since any chiral vertex function necessarily includes
antichiral vertices, the 1pi green functions of the wesszumino model can be composed
from green functions with integrated antichiral vertex insertions, if one takes into account
the correct combinatorial factors. due to a new r-symmetry of the extended wess
zumino model it turns out that the combinatorics indeed becomes very simple, since in
each loop order the number of antichiral vertices in the contributing diagrams is xed. in
section 4 we complete the above argumentation and generalize the result in such a way,
that also non-trivial normalization conditions of the wave-function renormalization are
taken into account.

for completeness we want to mention that on the basis of (2.18) and (2.19) one can
study insertions of antichiral vertices in green functions with antichiral legs or with
chiral and antichiral legs.
in both cases the power counting degree is not improved
by the relations of the covariant insertions since in the supersymmetry transformations
no x-derivatives are extracted, but the dimension of external legs is lowered by two -
dierentiations.

3. r-symmetry, supersymmetry and local couplings

the classical action of the wesszumino model with local coupling (2.10) is also

invariant under a r-symmetry,

whose generator is formally given by

w r

cl = 0,

w r




= z ds i(a +

(3.2)




 

)

)




 

.

(we call it r-symmetry, in order to distinguish it from usual conformal r-symmetry of
the massless wesszumino model.) the generator (3.2) attaches an r-weight 1 to the
chiral elds a and a r-weight +1 to the local coupling  with the corresponding sign
reversal for the respective conjugate elds. s and s are counted with a weight +1 and
1 respectively. r-symmetry is naively maintained in the procedure of renormalization.
the bphz scheme adopted further on does respect supersymmetry and so we proceed to
derive consequences of those symmetries for the quantum action  (2.13):

 = cl +



xl=1

(l)

(3.3)

the implementation of supersymmetry restricts the - and -dependence of the 1pi green
functions [3]:

(3.4)

with in  i  n and j n  j  n. (if only chiral or only antichiral legs and vertices
are present, the exponent vanishes and the respective green functions depend only on the
dierences in or j n.)

we want to nd out the restrictions due to r-neutrality of the various contributions.
let us consider a supereld green function with a xed number, say x and x, of external
s and s (guring in the expansions of the elds a and  on one hand and of elds a
and  on the other hand). the coecient functions fn,n,m, m can be expanded into a nite

8

series of terms ordered with respect to the powers  and  of the dierence variables im
and j m:

fn,n,m, m =

2(m+n1)

p ,(ln, ln)f,(xl, xl)

(3.5)

an additional source of s and s is supplied by the exponential factor in (3.4). let
k be the (equal) number of s and s to a specic term coming from the exponential.
the overall number of s and s (internal and external) is determined by the number of
external legs and vertices. this yields

 + x + k = 2(m + n)

and  + x + k = 2( m + n).

(3.6)

r-neutrality, that is the vanishing of the r weight of the specic contribution,

(w r

)n,n,m, m = 0,

is guaranteed through the relation

n + n + 3m  3 m   +  = 0.

in addition we have the graphological constraint (2.14)

m + m = n + n + 2(l  1).

(3.7)

(3.9)

eliminating in eqs. (3.6), (3.8) and (3.9)  and  and solving for m and m one nds

(3.10)

it means in words that the number of chiral and antichiral vertices is uniquely determined
by the setting of external elds and the loop order.
it is also easy to verify that the
conditions (3.6), (3.8) and (3.9) cannot be matched non-trivially, if only chiral legs and
chiral vertices are present (n = m = 0 and  = 0 ) or if only antichiral legs and antichiral
vertices are present (n = m = 0 and  = 0 ).

4. the non-renormalization of chiral vertex functions

for the consistent renormalization of the wess-zumino model with local couplings one
has to x all conceivable counterterms by suitable normalization conditions. in the bphz
scheme possible counterterms are included in ef f :

with

ef f = o + int + ct

o = z dv ae2i  a +

m
8

(z ds a2 +z d s a2)

int =

1

48(cid:16)z ds a3 +z d s  a3(cid:17)

(4.1)

(4.2)

and ct denoting the most general collection of local counterterms (see below). the di-
mension of ef f is restricted by renormalizability to be not larger than 4. since the bphz
scheme in superspace is a supersymmetric invariant scheme, the possible counterterms ap-
pearing in ef f are supersymmetric. as we have shown in the last section r-invariance
excludes green functions with exclusively consist of chiral vertices and chiral legs. there-
fore it also forbids to add the corresponding trivial counterterms to the interaction vertex
and to the mass term:

w r z ds na3 = i(n  1)z ds na3 6= 0, if n > 1,
w r z ds na2 = inz ds na2 6= 0, if n > 0.

(4.3a)

(4.3b)

local eld polynomials to the classical chiral vertex functions which include chiral 
and antichiral  have dimension 5 and 6 and do not contribute to ef f . of course, this
already expresses, that the corresponding diagrams are non-local. one remains with the
counterterms to the kinetic term, whose dependence on  and  is again restricted by
r-neutrality (cf. (3.10) with x  x = 0):

ct =



xl=1

z dv z(l)lae2i (l a)

(4.4)

we want to mention that there are also some further counterterms, which vanish in the
limit to constant coupling. they are not relevant to the present analysis and we omit
them from ef f . the parameters z(l) may be xed in loop order l by the normalization
condition of the wess-zumino model (cf. (2.5)):

f f (p2 = 2) = 1

(4.5)

10

in order to complete the analysis of non-renormalization theorems of chiral vertex
functions we consider 1pi green functions with n external chiral a-legs and discuss the
limit to constant coupling. eventually the chiral green functions of the wess-zumino
model are expressed in terms of green functions of the extended wess-zumino model,
which are convergent by power counting. the manifest supersymmetric expressions for
green functions (3.4) with n chiral a-legs and m chiral and m antichiral vertices is given
by

n,0,m, m(x1, 1 . . . xn+m, n+m, x1, 1 . . . x m,  m)

the power counting degree of divergence can be determined by the power counting formula

ns is here the number of all chiral and antichiral legs,

nsds = nada + nd + n d  = n.

(4.9)

the limit to constant coupling is performed by integrating the m chiral and m antichiral

(4.10)

of course in this limiting procedure the power counting degree (4.9) of the vertex functions
is not changed.

for saturation of the -integrations in (4.10) the relevant supereld green functions
have to depend on 2 m s. since the functions fn,0,m, m (4.6) only depend on the dierences

11

j m, they contribute at most with 2( m 1) s. the expansion of the exponential function
in (3.4) breaks o at second order, which yields the two further s. therefore we nd,
that all non-vanishing contributions have the following structure in the number of s
(cf. (3.6)):

 = 2( m  1),

k = 2.

(4.11)

let us now consider the number of s. the green functions with  = 2(2n + m  1)
corresponding to x = 0 vanish in the limit to constant coupling. before integration these
green functions are related to green functions with n -legs and a supersymmetric vertex
inserted:

(4.12)

and are not present in the wess-zumino model due to supersymmetry. from r-invariance
(3.10) we read o that they correspond to diagrams with n + l  1 chiral vertices and
l  1 antichiral vertices. their power counting degree is determined from eq. (4.9) to be
2  n.

the next less divergent type of supereld green functions are the ones with  =
2(n + m  2) corresponding to x + k = 4 (3.6). in loop order l they contain according
to r-neutrality (3.10) l antichiral vertices  and n + l  2 chiral vertices . since in
the limit to constant coupling only the second order in the expansion of the exponential
contributes, the resulting integrated vertex functions have 2(n  1) powers of s and are
the chiral vertex functions n of the wess-zumino model:

(l)
n,0,n+l2,l

, 
 (l)

n

(4.13)

their degree of divergence is determined from the power counting formula in presence of
local eld couplings, eq. (4.9). with

one has

( + ) = n + m + m  3 = 2n + 2(l  1)  3

dn,0,n+l2,l = dn = 1  n.

(4.15)

compared to power counting in the ordinary wess-zumino model (2.6) the degree of
divergence is improved by 2 and all chiral green functions of the wess-zumino model are
convergent emerging from convergent diagrams of the extended wess-zumino model with
local couplings. evaluating (4.10) they are seen to vanish at zero momentum, since the

12

second order of the exponential function yields two x-dierentiations:

by dierentiation with respect to the antichiral coupling the green functions n,0,m, m
can be related to green functions with covariant a3-insertions (cf. (2.16)). in particular
fn,0,n+l2,l (4.16) may be expressed in terms of green functions having an integrated
3-insertion on an internal vertex and otherwise interaction vertices of the wess-zumino
model. similarly r-symmetry makes it possible, to express chiral green functions of the
wess-zumino model directly in terms of green functions with an antichiral integrated
vertex insertion. in summary, the results of the algebraic analysis of non-renormalization
theorems is expressed in the following simple formulae in momentum space:

in the algebraic analysis of the non-renormalization theorems counterterms to the kinetic
term appear in the same way as the interaction vertices: insertions of the supersymmetric
invariant are transformed into the lowest component of the respective supermultiplet by
extracting at the same time two derivatives on the external legs. this implies that the full
insertion related to the derivative of the antichiral coupling can be written as a second
supersymmetry variation of a lower dimensional eld monomial.

5. non-renormalization theorems in the massless model

the algebraic analysis of non-renormalization theorems in the massless model is carried
out in the same way as in the massive one. the renormalization of the massless wess
zumino model with local eld couplings can be performed by the massless version of the
bphz scheme, the bphzl scheme [14] in superspace [13]. in addition to the ultraviolet
degree of power counting one assigns to every eld also an infrared degree of power
counting

dimir a = dimir a = 1 and

dimir  = dimir  = 0

(5.1)

14

the ef f will only include counterterms with infrared dimension greater or equal 4
(cf. (4.1),(4.2) and (4.4)):

ef f = o + int + ct

o = z dv ae2i  a +

z dv z(l)lae2i (l a)
xl=1



m(s  1) is the auxiliary mass term of the bphzl scheme with the subtraction param-
eter s. the massless limit is achieved by taking s = 1 after all subtractions have been
performed (see e.g. [6] for a detailed discussion of the bphzl scheme in superspace). the
massless model satises the supersymmetry ward identities (2.11) and its green functions
are r-symmetric (cf. (3.2) and (3.10)):

w q

  = 0,

w

q
  = 0 and w r

 = 0.

(5.4)

the normalization condition of the wave-function normalization has to be taken at a
non-zero normalization point 2 (4.5). it is well-known that the massless wesszumino
model is invariant under conformal r-symmetry. for this reason the only non-vanishing
chiral 1pi green functions are those with three external chiral a-legs. the construction of
chiral 3-point functions in expressions of green functions of the wesszumino model with
local couplings proceeds as in the massive model and chiral 3-point functions are related
to supercially convergent green functions with covariant vertex insertions. taking into
account the infrared power counting degree of the insertions, eq. (4.18) can be taken
without modications to the massless model:

the insertions q4 and q3 are dened by dierentiation with respect to the local antichi-
ral coupling (see eqs. (4.19) and (4.20)).
in the expressions of eq. (5.5) there are no

15

o-shell infrared problems, since green functions with a single integrated 3-3-insertion
exist for non-exceptional momenta. therefore the ultraviolet degree of power counting is
improved as in the massive model by relating the invariant vertices to the lower dimen-
sional eld monomials, and neither an ultraviolet nor an infrared overall subtraction has
to be performed (cf. (4.15)):

d = r = 2

for chiral 3-point functions.

(5.6)

in contrast to the massive model the conclusion, that chiral green functions vanish
at zero momentum, is not true in the massless model, since the green functions with
integrated q3-insertions have poles in the external momenta. in the above expressions
(5.5) these poles are canceled by multiplication with the external momenta resulting in a
non-vanishing and even in higher than 2-loop order logarithmically divergent contribution
to the eective potential at zero momentum. a detailed discussion of the infrared behavior
is most conveniently done in terms of component elds. we take equation (a.4) with
p3 = 0:

(l)
f (p1, p1, 0) =

(p2, p3, p1)(cid:19)

by infrared power counting we conclude, that the chiral green function of the wess
zumino model on the left-hand-side exists, since the external -leg, which is associated
with p3, has infrared dimension 1. in the lowest contributing loop order l = 2 there are
no divergent subdiagrams and the expression is nite according to the improved power
counting formula (5.6). for this reason and for dimensional reasons the value of the chiral
3-point function at p3 = 0 is a pure number in 2-loop order and exists therefore also at
the exceptional momentum p1 = p3 = 0. in higher orders self-energy diagrams appear as
subdiagrams and have to be subtracted. then the chiral 3-point function depends on the
ratio p2

2 and is in general logarithmically infrared divergent at p1 = 0:

f (p1, p1, 0) = c

f (p1, p1, 0) = f (l)(

for

l  3

(5.8)

the green functions with the 3-3-insertions appearing on the right-hand-side of eq. (5.7)
are in general infrared divergent for p3 = 0, since one produces in this way a second

16

integrated 3-3- or even 2-2-insertion. for dimensional reasons they have the form

(cid:16)(cid:2)z d4x q3(x)(cid:3)3

(5.9)

with the functions gi being at most logarithmically divergent at pi = 0. if the vanishing
momentum is associated with the external f -leg as it happens in the rst line of eq. (5.7),
one produces in principle an integrated 2-2-insertion, which corresponds to a 2-dimensional
mass insertion into a massless diagram. the corresponding integrals do not exist and the
green function in (5.9) has a pole even for p1 6= 0. in its contribution to the chiral green
functions of the wesszumino model the pole is canceled by multiplication with p2
3. in
the second and third line of eq. (5.7) the momenta associated with the -legs are put
to zero. from the existence of the left-hand-side at p3 = 0 we can conclude that the
corresponding green functions with integrated q3-insertion exist for p1 6= 0:

(cid:16)(cid:2)z d4x q3(x)(cid:3)3

 (cid:17)

f

(p1, 0, p1) =

(5.10)

at zero momentum all poles are canceled by the additional external momentum factors
leaving behind a non-vanishing nite number in 2-loop order and a logarithmically diver-
gent expression in orders l  3.

since in 2-loop order the chiral 3-point function is a nite integral, its value at pi = 0,
which has been calculated in ref. [11], is a characteristic number of the wesszumino
model.

6. conclusions

the algebraic property of interaction vertices to be second supersymmetry variations
of lower dimensional eld monomials has been used to derive the non-renormalization
theorems on the basis of algebraic renormalization. the technical tool for carrying out
the analysis is the extension of the ordinary coupling of the wess-zumino model to an
external eld multiplet in superspace. local couplings in the wess-zumino model turned
out to be a useful technique for getting insight into the chiral/antichiral vertex structure
of dierent diagrams: based on a modied r-symmetry we could prove, that all non-
local vertex functions consist of a denite number of chiral and antichiral vertices. green
functions with only chiral external a-legs are supercially convergent by power counting in
the extended model. using the supersymmetry ward identities explicit expressions for the

17

chiral vertex functions have been derived by extracting two supersymmetry variations from
an internal antichiral vertex and transforming them to two derivatives acting on external
legs. by performing this analysis in the massless version the cancellation of ultraviolet
divergencies in chiral vertex functions can be proven without referring to properties of the
superpotential inicted with infrared singularities at zero momentum.

appendix: non-renormalization theorems in component elds

in this appendix we give the expressions for the non-renormalization of chiral vertex
functions, eq. (4.18), in terms of component elds. we start with the 2-point function.
the contributing diagrams have l chiral and l antichiral vertices and the function f2,0,l,l
(4.17) does not depend on  due to r-symmetry (cf. section 3 and in particular eq. (3.10)):

f2,0,l,l(x1, x2, 12) = f (x1, x2) = f (x2, x1)

(a.1)

one nds in momentum space:

f (p1, p1) =

 (cid:17)(l)

f f

(p1, p1)

(a.2)

with q3 being dened by dierentiation with respect to the highest component f (x) of
the antichiral coupling (see eq. (4.20)).

for the 3-point function one has 1 + l chiral and l antichiral vertices in every loop
order and the function f3,0,1+l,l(x1, x2, 12, 13) (4.17) is of degree 2 in i3. after having
properly symmetrized we nd

f3,0,l+1,l(x1, x2, x3, 13, 12) = 2

23f (x2, x3; x1) (a.3)

12f (x1, x2; x3) + 2

13f (x1, x3; x2) + 2

with 23 = 13  12 and f (x1, x2; x3) = f (x2, x1; x3). inserting f3,0,l+1,l in this form into
the generating functional of 1pi green functions one derives for the 3-point function of

18

component elds the following expression (p1 + p2 + p3 = 0):
